I have only to thank those to whose kindness I am deeply indebted.\r\nProfessor Buckland was so good as to help me when I was striving to\r\nutilize the evidence of the Roman jurists. Chapter XLIX in particular\r\nowes much to his genial chastisement. On chapters II and LXI Mr G G\r\nCoulton has given me most valuable criticism. Yet I thank these gentlemen\r\nwith some reluctance, fearing that I may seem to connect their names\r\nwith errors of my own. Mr T R Glover kindly read chapter XXIX. Professor\r\nHousman called my attention to the ‘Farmer’s Law,’ and kindly lent me\r\nMr Ashburner’s articles, to which I have referred in Appendix B. To all\r\nthese, and to the Syndics of the University Press for undertaking the\r\npublication of this unconventional work, I hereby express my sincere\r\ngratitude. My reasons for adopting the method followed in this book are\r\ngiven on pages 5-6 and 468.\r\n\r\n                                                              W E HEITLAND\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE\r\n\r\n_August 1920_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                     PAGES\r\n\r\n                              INTRODUCTORY\r\n\r\n        I.

EVIDENCE.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry of which the results are set forth in these pages was\r\nundertaken in the endeavour to satisfy my own mind on a very important\r\nquestion in the history of the past. Circumstances have compelled me to\r\ninterest myself in the civilization of the Greco-Roman world. And it has\r\nalways been a painful disadvantage to students of the ‘classical’ systems\r\nthat the available record neither provides adequate labour-statistics\r\nnor furnishes a criticism of existing labour-conditions from the point\r\nof view of the handworkers. Accustomed as we are nowadays to continual\r\nagitations for increase of wages and reduction of working hours, with\r\ncenturies of strange experience in the working of Poor-laws, we are\r\nin no danger of undervaluing the importance of the wage-earner in our\r\nsocial fabric. We are rather in danger of forgetting other (and perhaps\r\nnot less vital) considerations, under pressure of the material claims\r\nof the labourer and his hire. Power goes by votes; the handworker is\r\nnow a voter; and the voice of the handworker is loud in the land. No\r\nscheme is too wild to find advocates; and those who venture to assert\r\nthe right of invention, organization and thrift to superior recognition\r\nas public benefits often think it necessary to adopt an apologetic tone.\r\nNow it may be that this is a passing phase, and that the so-called\r\n‘working-class’—that is, handworkers for wages—will come to see that\r\nthe civilization whose comforts they enjoy, and whose discomforts they\r\nresent, does not wholly depend upon the simple repeated acts of the\r\nhandworkers themselves. Perhaps there are already signs of some such\r\nreaction. But, if so, the reaction must be voluntary; for no power exists\r\nin this country to constrain the handworker to take reasonable views, in\r\nshort to face facts. In these words I am not implying any denial of the\r\nreasonableness of many of his claims. To offer an opinion on questions of\r\nmore or less is no business of mine.\r\n\r\nBut, when we compare modern industries in general with those of the\r\nancient world, we find ourselves in presence of a very different\r\nsituation. The largest scale of operations attainable in antiquity seems\r\nsmall and crude by the side of recent achievements, for instance the\r\nbuilding of the Pyramids compared with the Panama canal. Machinery,\r\ntransport, and scientific discovery in general, have made it possible\r\nto carry out colossal undertakings with comparative ease and without\r\nwholesale destruction of human life. The greatest works of the ancients\r\nare for the most part silent witnesses to the ruthless employment of\r\nforced labour, either that of captives or bought slaves or that of the\r\nimpressed subjects of an autocrat. Mere brute force, applied in unlimited\r\nquantity[1] with callous indifference to the sufferings of the toilers,\r\nwas the chief means at disposal: mechanical invention had got so far\r\nas to render possible some tasks that without it could not have been\r\nperformed at all. It gave extended effect to the mass of forced labour,\r\nand there it stopped, for we have no reason to think that it improved the\r\nlabourer’s lot. The surviving evidence as to the condition[2] of slaves\r\nin mines and factories enables us to form some faint notion of the human\r\nwastage resulting from the cruel forced-labour system. We may then state\r\nthe position briefly thus: to attempt great enterprises was only possible\r\nthrough the crude employment of labour in great masses: the supply of\r\nthis labour was, or appeared to be, procurable only by compulsion: and\r\ncompulsion was operative through the institution of slavery or the\r\npassive submission of cowed populations to the will of despots. But if\r\nslavery promoted large-scale enterprise, surely large-scale enterprise\r\ntended to establish slavery in the form of forced labour more firmly than\r\never. In the modern world the necessity of employing free labour has\r\nstimulated scientific invention, in mechanical and other departments, the\r\ntendency of which is to require greater intellectual[3] development in\r\nthe labourer, and in the long run to furnish him with effective means of\r\nasserting his own freedom.\r\n\r\nUnder modern conditions, the gradual displacement of small handicraftsmen\r\nby the growth of great capitalistic combinations is going on, perhaps\r\nnot always for good. The public accept this result as fate. And, if\r\neconomy in production and prime-cost cheapness are the only things worth\r\nconsidering, it is not easy to condemn the process. But events are\r\nsteadily demonstrating the fear once entertained, that handworkers in\r\ngeneral would find their position weakened thereby, to be groundless. If\r\nthe independent craftsman has lost ground, the wage-earning journeyman\r\nhas gained. We need not follow out this topic in detail, but note the\r\ncontrast presented by the ancient world. The ‘small man’ in crafts and\r\ntrades was able to hold his own, for without steam-power the capitalist\r\nwas not strong enough to suppress him. In a small way he was something\r\nof a capitalist himself, and commonly owned slave-apprentices. His part\r\nin ancient civilization was undoubtedly far more important than it\r\nappears in literature: for he ministered to the ordinary needs of every\r\nday, while literature, then as now and more than now, chiefly recorded\r\nthe exceptional. When we turn to the wage-earner, who earns a living by\r\nhiring out his bodily powers to an employer, we are dealing with a wholly\r\ndifferent class. These are the free men who in a slave-holding society\r\nhave to compete with the slave. In the course of the present inquiry\r\nwe must keep a sharp look-out for every reference or allusion to such\r\npersons in the department of agriculture, and in particular note numerous\r\npassages in which the status of labourers cannot be inferred with\r\ncertainty from the language. But the importance of this special point is\r\nof course not confined to agriculture.\r\n\r\nI have chosen to limit my inquiry to the case of agriculture for these\r\nreasons. First, because it was and is the industry on which human life,\r\nand therefore all other industries and all progress, did and do rest.\r\nSecondly, because its economic importance in the ancient world, so far\r\nfrom declining, manifestly increased. The problem of food-supply was\r\nalways there. And it was never more pressing than in the later ages\r\nof Rome, when imperial efforts to enforce production, if successful,\r\nfed her barbarian armies, at the same time attracting the attention of\r\nbarbarian invaders to lands that promised the food-crops which they\r\nthemselves were too lazy to produce. Thirdly, because the importance\r\nof agriculture was and is not merely economic. Its moral value, as a\r\nnursery of steady citizens and, at need, of hardy soldiers, was and still\r\nshould be recognized by thoughtful men. Therefore its conditions and its\r\nrelative prosperity or decay deserve the attention of all historians\r\nof all periods. Unluckily statistical record of a scientific character\r\nis not available for the times that we call ancient, and numbers are\r\nnotoriously liable to corruption in manuscripts. Therefore I have only\r\nventured to give figures seldom and with reserve. For agriculture we\r\nhave nothing on the scale of the inscriptions that record wages, for\r\ninstance on public works at Athens. On the other hand we have for certain\r\nperiods the evidence of specialists such as Cato, Varro and Columella,\r\nto whom we owe much information as to the actual or possible conditions\r\nof rustic enterprise and labour. The relation of agriculture and\r\nagricultural labour to the state as a whole is a subject illustrated by\r\ngreat theorists such as Plato and Aristotle. The practical problems of\r\nlandowning and farming meet us now and then in the contemporary evidence\r\nof such men as Xenophon and the younger Pliny. Even orators, though\r\nnecessarily partisan witnesses, at times give valuable help: they may\r\ndistort facts, but it is not their interest to lessen their own power\r\nof persuasion by asserting what is manifestly incredible. The ancient\r\nhistorians tell us very little, even of the past; contemporary evidence\r\nfrom them is especially rare. They are preoccupied with public affairs,\r\nand the conditions of rustic life and labour only concern them at\r\nmoments when serious distress or disorder compels attention. Rhetoricians\r\nand poets are doubtful witnesses. Like the orators, they use their matter\r\nfreely and with much colouring for their immediate purposes. But they are\r\nnot, like forensic orators, in direct contact with practical emergencies.\r\nThe questions arising out of Vergil’s _Georgics_ are problems to be\r\ndiscussed by themselves.\r\n\r\nThe contribution of encyclopaedic or occasional writers is in some\r\ncases of value. I will here only name the elder Pliny and Apuleius.\r\nBooks of travel and geography, for instance Herodotus and Strabo, give\r\nstray details, but generally in reference to distant countries, mostly\r\nin the East and so hardly within my subject, save for purposes of\r\ncomparison. There are however two topics with which I am not directly\r\nconcerned, but which it is impossible wholly to ignore in speaking of\r\nancient agriculture. First, the relation of military duty to landholding\r\n[the farmer as citizen soldier], and mercenary service [the rustic as\r\nvolunteer for pay]. This has been so fully treated in modern handbooks\r\nthat I need say little about it. Secondly, the various conditions of\r\ntenure of land. That rustic life and therewith rustic labour were\r\ndirectly and deeply affected by varieties of tenure, needs no proof. The\r\ncited opinions of Roman lawyers in the Digest are the main authority on\r\npoints of this kind, and stray references elsewhere serve to illustrate\r\nthem. In conclusion I have only to insist again on the fact that we have\r\nno direct witness of the labourer’s, or even the working farmer’s, point\r\nof view. The evidence all comes from above; and therefore generally gives\r\nus a picture of conditions as the law meant them to be and presumed them\r\nnormally to be. How far the practical working corresponded to the legal\r\nposition, is only to be guessed with caution from the admissions involved\r\nin the elaboration of legal remedies; and, in the case of imperial\r\n_coloni_, from the unique evidence of the notable African inscriptions.\r\n\r\nIt is I trust after the above considerations not unreasonable to devote\r\nno special chapters to certain writers whom nevertheless it is often\r\nnecessary to cite in notes. Diodorus, Livy, Athenaeus, Macrobius,\r\nGellius, Palladius, are cases of the kind. Stray references in their\r\nworks are valuable, but there is nothing to require a treatment of\r\nthem as several wholes. Even Livy is chiefly useful as handing down\r\nremains of past tradition: hence he (and Dionysius and Plutarch with\r\nhim) have a leading place in the introductory chapter on early Rome.\r\nSo too the writers of the so-called _historia Augusta_ and the laws of\r\nthe Theodosian and Justinian Codes find their place in the notes to\r\ncertain chapters. On the other hand (to omit obvious cases) Euripides,\r\nXenophon, the younger Seneca, Martial, the younger Pliny, Apuleius,\r\nAmmianus, Symmachus, Apollinaris Sidonius, need careful treatment with\r\nfull regard to the periods and circumstances by which their evidential\r\nvalues are severally qualified. And in order to place each witness in\r\nhis proper setting it is sometimes necessary to pause and group a number\r\nof circumstances together in a special chapter. This arises from the\r\nendeavour to preserve so far as possible the thread of continuity, which\r\nis always really there, though at times very thin, owing to the loss of\r\nmany works in the course of ages. In such chapters one has to look both\r\nbackward and forward, and often to digress for a moment on topics only\r\nconnected indirectly with the main object.\r\n\r\nI have tried to avoid needless repetitions, but some repetitions are\r\nunavoidable, since the same point often serves to illustrate different\r\nparts of the argument. To make a system of cross-references from chapter\r\nto chapter quite complete is hardly possible, and would add immensely\r\nto the bulk of footnotes. It has seemed better to attempt completeness\r\nby elaboration of the Index. A few details from a period later than\r\nthat with which I am concerned are given in the Appendix, as being\r\nof interest. Also the names of some books from which in a course of\r\nmiscellaneous reading I have derived more or less help, particularly in\r\nnoting modern survivals or analogies. For significant matter occurs in\r\nquite unexpected quarters. And the observers who record facts of rustic\r\nlife and labour in Italy or France, in North or Central or South America,\r\nwithout attempting to manipulate them in connexion with a theory, deserve\r\nmuch gratitude.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that in the handling of evidence there is room for some\r\nvariety of method. And it seems reasonable to hold that the choice of\r\nmethod should be mainly guided by two leading considerations, the nature\r\nof the evidence available and the aim of the inquiry pursued. In the\r\npresent case the inquiry deals with a part, a somewhat neglected part,\r\nof Greco-Roman history: and the subject is one that can by no means be\r\nstrictly confined to ascertaining the bare facts of farm life and labour.\r\nThat the conditions of agriculture were not only important in connexion\r\nwith food-supply, but had an extensive moral and political bearing, is\r\nsurely beyond dispute. And the nature of the surviving evidence favours,\r\nor rather requires, the taking of a correspondingly wide view. Outside\r\nthe circle of technical writings, the literary evidence almost always\r\nhas an eye to the position of agriculture as related to the common\r\nweal; nor is this point of view ignored even by the technical writers.\r\nTherefore, in treating the subject as I have tried to treat it, it is\r\nvery necessary to take each witness separately so far as possible, and\r\nnot to appraise the value of his testimony without a fair consideration\r\nof his condition and environment. This necessity is peculiarly obvious in\r\nthe case of the theorists, whose witness is instructive in a very high\r\ndegree, but only when we bear in mind the existing state of things from\r\nobservation of which their conclusions were derived. And the changes of\r\nattitude in philosophic thought are sometimes highly instructive. Take\r\nfarm life and labour as it appears to Plato and Aristotle and later to\r\nMusonius: a whole volume of history, economic moral and political, lies\r\nin the interval of some 400 years. Inscriptions furnish little to the\r\nstudent of this subject, but that little is worth having. To conclude\r\nthis paragraph, I do not apologize for putting my authorities in the\r\nwitness-box and questioning them one by one. For only thus do I see a\r\npossibility of giving a true picture of the conditions with which I am\r\nconcerned. It is a long method, but perhaps not uninteresting, and I see\r\nno other.\r\n\r\nIt may seem necessary to explain why I have not devoted special chapters\r\nto rustic life and labour in Oriental countries, some of which eventually\r\nbecame parts of the Roman empire. Such countries are for instance Egypt,\r\nPalestine and Syria. One reason is that I could do nothing more than\r\ncompile conclusions of the inquirers who have lately rescued a vast mass\r\nof detail, chiefly from the Egyptian papyri. Age forbade me to undertake\r\nthis task unless it seemed clear that my inquiry really depended on it.\r\nBut, inasmuch as I have not been trying to produce a technical treatise\r\nupon ancient agriculture, I do not think it necessary. That there is\r\nroom for such a treatise, I have no doubt: nor that its writer will\r\nneed to have many years at his disposal and a good knowledge of several\r\nsciences at his back. With regard to eastern countries other than Egypt,\r\npractically the Seleucid empire, knowledge is at present very scanty,\r\nas Rostowzew has to confess. Ancient India lies quite beyond my range,\r\nas having never been a part of the Roman empire: but there is evidently\r\nmuch of interest to be gathered in this field. From these extensive and\r\npromising researches my limited effort is divided by a clearly marked\r\nline. I am concerned with agriculture and agricultural labour not as the\r\noccupation of passive populations merely producing so much food year by\r\nyear, peoples over whom centuries might pass without ascertainable change\r\nof a moral social or political character. Such peoples, in short, as do\r\nnot get beyond the conception of ruler and ruled to that of state and\r\ncitizen, or at least have not yet done so. For of all conclusions to be\r\ndrawn from the history of the Greco-Roman world none seems to me more\r\ncertain than the fact that, while political social and moral movements\r\naffected the conditions of agriculture, agricultural changes reacted\r\nupon political social and moral conditions. Thus the general history of\r\nthe peoples, comprising the rise and fall of ancient efforts towards\r\nself-government, must always be kept in view: the fluctuations of what\r\nI may call civic values, and the position of farmers as labourers or\r\nemployers of labour cannot be treated in separate compartments and\r\ntheir reciprocal effect ignored. That in the later stages of my inquiry\r\nOriental influences begin to dominate Roman imperial policy, is evident,\r\nand I have not left this factor out of account. But this phenomenon\r\nannounces the end of the old world. The long struggle of the Empire in\r\nthe East and its final overthrow by the forces of Islam, its break-up in\r\nthe West and the foundation of new nation-states, are beyond my range. In\r\nthe Appendix I have put some remarks on two documents of the Byzantine\r\nperiod, from which we get glimpses of changes that were proceeding in the\r\neastern empire while it still held its ground and was indeed the most\r\nhighly organized of existing powers. To these I have subjoined a list of\r\nsome of the books I have consulted and found helpful in various degrees,\r\nparticularly such as have furnished modern illustrations in the way of\r\nanalogy or survival. A few special quotations from some of these may\r\nserve to shew how very striking such illustrations can be.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. LAND AND LABOUR.\r\n\r\nOf the many difficult questions connected with the past history of the\r\nhuman race few have evoked such a difference of opinion as the practical\r\nimportance of slavery. By some inquirers it has been held that the\r\nso-called ‘classical’ civilization of the Greco-Roman world rested upon\r\na slavery basis, in short that slavery alone enabled that civilization\r\nto follow the lines of its actual development. In reply to this doctrine\r\nit is urged[4] that its holders have been led astray by an unhistorical\r\nmethod. They have been deeply impressed by the all-pervading evils of\r\nthe economic and domestic slave-system during the period (say 200 BC-200\r\nAD roughly) when it was in full extension and vigour. The prepossession\r\nthus created has led them to misinterpret the phenomena of earlier ages,\r\nand to ignore the significance of the later period of decline. Prejudiced\r\neyes have detected slavery where it was not, and have seen in it where\r\nexistent an importance greater than impartial inquiry will justify.\r\nMoreover the discussion of slavery-questions in modern times, conducted\r\nwith the intemperate warmth of partisan controversy, have had an\r\ninfluence unfavourable to the statement of facts in their true relations,\r\nand therefore to the exercise of cool judgment. According to this view\r\nthe facts of our record shew that, while slave-labour had its four\r\ncenturies or so of predominance, free-labour never ceased, and on it,\r\nand not on slavery, the civilization of the ‘classical’ world was built\r\nup. It is argued that in primitive conditions there was little slavery,\r\nthat growth of trade and exchange (and therewith of civilization) led\r\nto division of labour and the growth of larger enterprises. On this\r\nfollows a time in which the employment of slave-labour becomes more and\r\nmore common, and ends by being for some centuries the basis of economic\r\nand domestic life. In due course comes the period of decline, when for\r\nvarious reasons slaves became less numerous, and the highly-organized\r\ncivilization of antiquity relapses into the primitive conditions of\r\nthe early Middle Age. Slavery is not extinct, but reverts generally to\r\nvarious degrees of serfdom, resembling that which meets us in the early\r\ntraditions of Greek slavery. Things have gone round the full circle, and\r\nthe world takes a fresh start.\r\n\r\nThis version of the process is attractive. It presents to us a spectacle\r\nof cyclic movement, pleasing from its simplicity and dignity. But it\r\nseems to imply that the old civilization reached its height more or\r\nless concurrently with the growth of slavery. One is driven to ask[5]\r\nwhether the concurrence was purely accidental or not. So far as concerns\r\nthe manufacture of articles for export by slave-industry, it can hardly\r\nhave been a mere chance: nor is it denied that in this department it\r\nwas the demand created by the needs of growing civilization that called\r\nforth the supply. Luxury too is merely a name for such needs when they\r\nclearly exceed strict necessaries of life: and here too the monstrous\r\nextravagancies of domestic slavery were a characteristic feature of the\r\ncivilization of the Greco-Roman world. That neither of these forms of\r\nservile employment could outlive the civilization that had produced them,\r\nis surely no wonder. The case of slavery in agriculture is less simple,\r\nand several questions may suggest themselves to anyone who considers this\r\nsubject with an open mind.\r\n\r\nAgriculture was long regarded, from a social point of view, as superior\r\nto other occupations dependent on bodily labour. This opinion dated\r\nfrom very early times when, as traditions agree, the land was owned by\r\nprivileged nobles who as members of powerful clans formed aristocracies\r\nof a more or less military character. War was waged by men fighting hand\r\nto hand, and it was natural that handwork of a kind likely to promote\r\nhealth and strength should be honoured above manual trades of a less\r\ninvigorating and even sedentary character. The development of cities and\r\nurban life, which in many states led to the overthrow of the old clan\r\naristocracies, did not make handicraftsmen the equals of agriculturists\r\nin popular esteem. Pressure to win a firm footing on the land was as\r\nmarked a feature in Athenian Attica as in Roman Latium. Agriculture was\r\na profession worthy of the free citizen, and the ownership of a plot of\r\nland stamped the citizen as a loyal and responsible member of a free and\r\nself-conscious community. The ruin of Attic farmers in the Peloponnesian\r\nwar, the disastrous changes in Italian agriculture after Rome became\r\nimperial, still left the old prepossession. The charm of country life\r\nand pursuits remained as an ineffective ideal. Greek philosophers were\r\nimpressed with the virtues of farmer-folk, virtues social moral and\r\nultimately political. From them Cicero and others learnt to praise\r\nrustic life: the Gracchi made vain efforts to revive it: the poets, led\r\nby Vergil, pictured the glories of old Italian agriculture: but the\r\naspirations were vain. The ‘classical’ civilization was urban in its\r\ngrowth, and urban it remained. Writers on agriculture might lament that\r\nfree men, capable of tilling the land, loitered idly in the city. In\r\npractice they had to take facts as they found them, and give elaborate\r\nprecepts for a farm-system in which slavery was the essential factor.\r\n\r\nIt was and is possible to regard agriculture from various points of\r\nview. Three of these at least deserve a preliminary consideration. The\r\nnakedly economic view, that the production of food is necessary for any\r\nlife above that of mere savages, and therefore is worthy of respect,\r\ncan never have been wholly absent from men’s minds in any age. It was\r\ncommon property, and found frequent expression. Even when various causes\r\nled to much dependence on imported corn, the sentiment still survived,\r\nand its soundness was recognized by philosophers. The military view,\r\nthat the hardy peasant makes the best soldier, was generally accepted in\r\nprinciple, but its relation to agriculture in the strict sense of tillage\r\nwas not always a direct one. The technical training of skilled combatants\r\nbegan early in Greece. It was not only in the Spartan or Cretan systems\r\nthat such training was normal: the citizen armies of Athens consisted\r\nof men who had passed through a long course of gymnastic exercises and\r\ndrill. During their training these young men can hardly have devoted\r\nmuch labour to the tillage of farms, even those of them who were of\r\ncountry birth. What percentage of them settled down in their later years\r\nto farm-life, is just what one vainly wishes to know. The helot-system\r\nsupplied the tillage that fed the warrior-caste of Sparta. It would seem\r\nthat the toils of hunting played a great part in producing the military\r\nfitness required of the young Spartiate. We may be pretty sure that\r\nthe Thessalian cavalry—wealthy lords ruling dependent cultivators—were\r\nnot tillers of the soil. Boeotia and Arcadia were both lands in which\r\nthere was a large farmer class. Boeotian infantry were notable for their\r\nsteadiness in the shock of battle. But they were not untrained, far from\r\nit. United action was ever difficult in Arcadia, where small cities\r\nlay scattered in the folds of mountains. Hence no Arcadian League ever\r\nplayed a leading part in Greece. But the rustics of these country towns\r\nand villages were man for man as good material for war-work as Greece\r\ncould produce. In the later age of professional soldering they, with the\r\nAetolians and others in the less civilized parts, furnished numbers of\r\nrecruits to the Greek mercenary armies. But the regular mercenary who had\r\nthe luck to retire in comfortable circumstances, on savings of pay and\r\nloot, is portrayed to us as more inclined to luxury and wantonness in\r\nsome great city than to the simple monotony of rustic life. Nor must we\r\nforget that slaves were often an important part[6] of war-booty, and that\r\nthe professional warrior was used to the attendance of slaves (male and\r\nfemale) even on campaigns. So far the connexion of peasant and soldier\r\ndoes not amount to much more than the admission that the former was a\r\ntype of man able to endure the hardships of a military career.\r\n\r\nThe national regular army formed by Philip son of Amyntas in Macedonia,\r\nafterwards the backbone of Alexander’s mixed host, is in itself a\r\nphenomenon of great interest: for in making it Philip made a nation.\r\nThat the ranks were mainly filled with country folk is certain. But,\r\nwhat with wastage in wars and the settlement of many old soldiers in the\r\nEast, there is little evidence to shew whether any considerable number\r\nof veterans returned to Macedon and settled on the land. I believe that\r\nsuch cases were few. The endless wars waged by Alexander’s successors\r\nwith mixed and mongrel armies were hardly favourable to rustic pursuits:\r\nfoundation of great new cities was the characteristic of the times. When\r\nwe turn to Rome we find a very different story. Tradition represents\r\nlandowners settled on the land and tilling it as the persons responsible\r\nfor the defence of the state. Cincinnatus called from the plough to\r\nbe dictator is the typical figure of early patriotic legend. When the\r\nRoman Plebeians dislodged the Patrician clans from their monopoly of\r\npolitical power, the burden of military service still rested on the\r\n_adsidui_, the men with a footing on the land. Tradition still shews us\r\nthe farmer-soldier taking the risk of disaster to his homestead during\r\nhis absence on campaigns. In the historical twilight of fragmentary\r\ndetails, coloured by later imagination, thus much is clear and credible.\r\nThe connexion between landholding and soldiering was not openly\r\ndisregarded until the reforms of Marius. The age of revolution was then\r\nalready begun, and one of its most striking features was the creation\r\nof a professional soldiery, a force which, as experience proved, was\r\nmore easy to raise than to disband. The method of pensioning veterans\r\nby assigning to them parcels of land for settlement was in general a\r\nfailure, for the men were unused to thrift and indisposed to a life of\r\npatient and uneventful labour. The problem of the Republic was inherited\r\nby the Empire, and attempts at solution were only partially successful:\r\nbut the system of standing armies, posted on the frontiers, made the\r\nsettlement of veterans in border-provinces a matter of less difficulty.\r\nFrom the third century AD onwards we find a new plan coming into use. Men\r\nwere settled with their families on lands near the frontiers, holding\r\nthem by a military tenure which imposed hereditary liability to service\r\nin the armies. Thus the difficulty was for a time met by approaching it\r\nfrom the other end. The superiority of the rustic recruit was as fully\r\nrecognized as ever: at the end of the fourth century it was reaffirmed[7]\r\nby Vegetius.\r\n\r\nI pass on to the third point of view, which I may perhaps call\r\nphilosophic. It appears in practice as the view of the statesman, in\r\ntheory as that of the speculative philosopher. Men whose life and\r\ninterests are bound up with agriculture are in general a steady class,\r\nlittle inclined to wild agitations and rash ventures. On a farm there\r\nis always something not to be left undone without risk of loss. The\r\noperations of nature go on unceasingly, uncontrolled by man. Man must\r\nadapt himself to the conditions of soil and weather: hence he must be\r\never on the watch to take advantage of his opportunities, and this leaves\r\nhim scant leisure for politics. We may add that the habit of conforming\r\nto nature’s laws, and of profiting by not resisting what cannot be\r\nsuccessfully resisted, is a perpetual education in patience. Working\r\nfarmers as a class were not men lightly to embark in revolutionary\r\nschemes, so long as their condition was at all tolerable. It must be\r\nborne in mind that before the invention of representative systems a\r\ncitizen could only vote by appearing in person at the city, where all the\r\nAssemblies were held. Assemblies might be adjourned, and two journeys,\r\nto the city and back, were not only time-wasting and tiresome, but\r\nmight have to be repeated. Accordingly we hear of the encouragement of\r\nAttic farmers by Peisistratus[8] as being a policy designed to promote\r\nthe stability of his government. At Rome we find reformers alarmed at\r\nthe decay of the farmer-class in a great part of Italy, and straining\r\nto revive it as the sound basis of a national life, the only practical\r\nmeans of purifying the corrupted institutions of the state. Selfish\r\nopposition on the part of those interested in corruption was too strong\r\nfor reformers, and the chance of building up a true Italian nation passed\r\naway. The working farmer had disappeared from Roman politics. The swords\r\nand the venal city mob remained, and the later literature was left to\r\ndeplore the consequences.\r\n\r\nThe course of agricultural decline in Greece was different in detail from\r\nthat in Italy, but its evil effects on political life were early noted,\r\nat least in Attica. The rationalist Euripides saw the danger clearly,\r\nduring the Peloponnesian war; and the sympathy of the conservative\r\nAristophanes with the suffering farmers was plainly marked. The merits\r\nof the farmer-class as ‘safe’ citizens, the backbone of a wise and\r\ndurable state-life, became almost a commonplace of Greek political\r\ntheory. Plato and Aristotle might dream of ideal states, governed by\r\nskilled specialists professionally trained for their career from boyhood.\r\nIn their more practical moments, turning from aspirations to facts\r\nof the world around them, they confessed the political value of the\r\nfarmer-class. To Aristotle the best hope of making democracy a wholesome\r\nand tolerable form of government lay in the strengthening of this\r\nelement: the best Demos is the γεωργικὸς δῆμος, and it is a pity that it\r\nso often becomes superseded by the growing population devoted to trades\r\nand commerce. I need not carry further these brief and imperfect outlines\r\nof the honourable opinion held of agriculture in the Greco-Roman world.\r\nAs producing necessary food, as rearing hardy soldiers, as favouring the\r\ngrowth and maintenance of civic virtues, it was the subject of general\r\npraise. Some might confess that they shrank from personal labour on the\r\nland. Yet even in Caesarian Rome it is somewhat startling when Sallust[9]\r\ndismisses farming in a few words of cynical contempt.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the respect felt for agriculture was largely due to\r\nthe opinion that valuable qualities of body and mind were closely\r\nconnected with its practice and strengthened thereby. So long as it\r\nwas on the primitive footing, each household finding labour for its\r\nown maintenance, the separation of handwork and direction could hardly\r\narise. This primitive state of things, assumed by theorists ancient and\r\nmodern, and depicted in tradition, had ceased to be normal in the time\r\nof our earliest records. And the employment of persons, not members of\r\nthe household, as hired labourers, or of bondmen only connected with the\r\nhouse as dependents, at once differentiated these ‘hands’ from the master\r\nand his family. The master could not habitually hire day-labourers or\r\nkeep a slave unless he found it paid him to do so. For a man to work for\r\nhis own profit or for that of another were very different things. This\r\nsimple truism, however, does not end the matter from my present point of\r\nview. It is necessary to ask whether the respect felt for agriculture\r\nwas so extended as to include the hired labourer and the slave as well\r\nas the working master. We shall see that it was not. The house-master,\r\nholding and cultivating a plot of land on a secure tenure, is the figure\r\nglorified in traditions and legendary scenes. The Greek term αὐτουργός,\r\nthe man who does his own work, is specially applied to him as a man that\r\nworks with his own hands. It crops up in literature often, from Euripides\r\nto Polybius and Dion Chrysostom; and sometimes, when the word is not\r\nused, it is represented by equivalents. But both the hired labourer and\r\nthe slave were employed for the express purpose of working with their\r\nown hands. And yet, so far as agriculture is concerned, I cannot find\r\nthat they were credited with αὐτουργία, the connotation[10] of which\r\nis generally favourable, seldom neutral, never (I think) unfavourable.\r\nIt seems then that the figure present to the mind was one who not only\r\nworked with his own hands, but worked for his own profit—that is, on his\r\nown farm. And with this interpretation the traditions of early Rome fully\r\nagree.\r\n\r\nTo admit this does not however imply that the working house-master\r\nemployed neither hired labourer nor slave. So long as he took a hand\r\nin the farm-work, he was a working cultivator for his own profit. The\r\nlarger the scale of his holding, the more he would need extra labour.\r\nIf prosperous, he would be able to increase his holding or supplement\r\nhis farming[11] by other enterprises. More and more he would be tempted\r\nto drop handwork and devote himself to direction. If still successful,\r\nhe might move on a stage further, living in the city and carrying on\r\nhis farms by deputy, employing stewards, hired freemen or slaves, or\r\nfreedmen, his former slaves. If he found in the city more remunerative\r\npursuits than agriculture, he might sell his land and the live and dead\r\nstock thereon, and become simply an urban capitalist. So far as I know,\r\nthis last step was very seldom taken; and I believe the restraining\r\ninfluence to have been the prestige attached to the ownership of land,\r\neven when civic franchises had ceased to depend on the possession of that\r\nform of property alone. If this view be correct, the fact is notable: for\r\nthe system of great landed estates, managed by stewards[12] on behalf of\r\nwealthy owners who lived in the city, was the ruin of the peasant farmer\r\nclass, in whose qualities statesmen and philosophers saw the guarantee\r\nfor the state’s lasting vigour. No longer were αὐτουργοὶ a force in\r\npolitics: in military service the professional soldier, idling in the\r\nintervals of wars, superseded the rustic, levied for a campaign and\r\nlooking forward to the hour of returning to his plough. It was in Italy\r\nthat the consummation of this change was most marked, for Rome alone\r\nprovided a centre in which the great landlord could reside and influence\r\npolitical action in his own interest. To Rome the wealth extorted from\r\ntributary subjects flowed in an ever-swelling stream. No small part of\r\nthe spoils served to enrich the noble landlords, directly or indirectly,\r\nand to supply them with the funds needed for corrupting the city mob\r\nand so controlling politics. Many could afford to hold their lands even\r\nwhen it was doubtful whether estates managed by slaves or hirelings\r\nwere in fact a remunerative investment. If we may believe Cicero, it\r\nwas financial inability[13] to continue this extravagant policy that\r\ndrove some men of apparent wealth to favour revolutionary schemes. The\r\nold-fashioned farmstead, the _villa_, was modernized into a luxurious\r\ncountry seat, in which the owner might now and then pass a brief recess,\r\nattended by his domestic slaves from Town, and perhaps ostentatiously\r\nentertaining a party of fashionable friends.\r\n\r\nWe have followed the sinister progress of what I will call the\r\nAgricultural Interest, from the ‘horny-handed’ peasant[14] farmer to\r\nthe land-proud capitalist. No doubt the picture is a highly coloured\r\none, but in its general outlines we are not entitled to question its\r\ntruth. Exceptions there certainly were. In hilly parts of Italy a rustic\r\npopulation[15] of freemen survived, and it was from them that the jobbing\r\ngangs of wage-earners of whom we read were drawn. And in the great plain\r\nof the Po agricultural conditions remained far more satisfactory than in\r\nsuch districts as Etruria or Lucania, where great estates were common.\r\nA genuine farming population seems there to have held most of the land,\r\nand rustic slavery appeared in less revolting form. But these exceptions\r\ndid not avail to stay the decline of rural Italy. True, as the supply\r\nof slave-labour gradually shrank in the empire, the working farmer\r\nreappeared on the land. But he reappeared as a tenant gradually becoming\r\nbound[16] to the soil, worried by the exactions of officials, or liable\r\nto a blood-tax in the shape of military service. He was becoming not a\r\nfree citizen of a free state, but a half-free serf helplessly involved in\r\na great mechanical system. Such a person bore little resemblance to the\r\nfree farmer working with his own hands for himself on his own land, the\r\nrustic figure from whom we started. On the military side, he was, if a\r\nsoldier, now soldier first and farmer afterwards: on the civic side, he\r\nwas a mere subject-unit, whose virtues were of no political importance\r\nand commanded no respect. In the final stage we find the government\r\nrecruiting its armies from barbarians and concerned to keep the farmer on\r\nthe land. So cogent then was the necessity of insuring the supply of food\r\nfor the empire and its armies.\r\n\r\nAt this point we must return to our first question, how far the\r\nagriculture of the Greco-Roman world depended on free or slave labour.\r\nIt is clear that, while the presence of the slave presupposes the\r\nfreeman to control him, the presence of the freeman does not necessarily\r\nimply that of the slave. Dion Chrysostom[17] was logically justified in\r\nsaying that freedom comes before slavery in order of time. And no doubt\r\nthis is true so long as we only contemplate the primitive condition of\r\nhouseholds each providing for its own vital needs by the labour of its\r\nmembers. But the growth of what we call civilization springs from the\r\nextension of needs beyond the limits of what is absolutely necessary for\r\nhuman existence. By what steps the advantages of division of labour were\r\nactually discovered is a subject for the reconstructive theorist. But it\r\nmust have been observed at a very early stage that one man’s labour might\r\nbe to another man’s profit. Those who tamed and employed other animals\r\nwere not likely to ignore the possibilities offered by the extension of\r\nthe system to their brother men. It would seem the most natural thing\r\nin the world. It might be on a very small scale, and any reluctance on\r\nthe bondsman’s part might be lessened by the compensations of food and\r\nprotection. A powerful master might gather round him a number of such\r\ndependent beings, and he had nothing to gain by treating them cruelly.\r\nOn them he could devolve the labour of producing food, and so set free\r\nhis own kinsmen to assert the power of their house. In an age of conflict\r\nstronger units tended to absorb weaker, and the formation of larger\r\nsocieties would tend to create fresh needs, to encourage the division of\r\nlabour, and to promote civilization by the process of exchange. Labour\r\nunder assured control was likely to prove an economic asset of increasing\r\nvalue. In agriculture it would be of special importance as providing food\r\nfor warriors busied with serving the community in war.\r\n\r\nThis imaginative sketch may serve to remind us that there are two\r\nquestions open to discussion in relation to the subject. First, the\r\npurely speculative one, whether the early stages of progress in\r\ncivilization could have been passed without the help of slavery. Second,\r\nthe question of fact, whether they were so passed or not. It is the\r\nlatter with which I am concerned. The defects of the evidence on which\r\nwe have to form an opinion are manifest. Much of it is not at first\r\nhand, and it will often be necessary to comment on its unsatisfactory\r\ncharacter. In proceeding to set it out in detail, I must again repeat\r\nthat two classes of free handworkers must be clearly kept distinct—those\r\nwho work for themselves, and those who work for others. It is the\r\nlatter class only that properly come into comparison with slaves. A man\r\nhabitually working for himself may of course work occasionally for others\r\nas a wage-earner. But here, as in the case of the farmer-soldier, we have\r\none person in two capacities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHORITIES IN DETAIL—GREEK\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE HOMERIC POEMS.\r\n\r\n=The Iliad.= In a great war-poem we can hardly expect to find many\r\nreferences to the economic labours of peace. And an army fighting far\r\nfrom home in a foreign land would naturally be out of touch with the\r\nrustic life of Greece. Nor was the poet concerned to offer us the details\r\nof supply-service, though he represents the commissariat as efficient.\r\nFree labour appears[18] in various forms of handicraft, and the mention\r\nof pay (μισθός)[19] shews wage-earning as a recognized fact. We hear of\r\nserving for hire (θητεύειν)[20], and the ἔριθοι or farm-labourers[21]\r\nseem to be θῆτες under a special name. That labour is not viewed as a\r\ngreat degradation may fairly be inferred from the case of Hephaestus the\r\nsmith-god, from the wage-service of Poseidon and Apollo under Laomedon,\r\nand from the herdsman-service of Apollo under Admetus. Agriculture is\r\nassumed, and in the Catalogue ‘works’ (ἔργα)[22] occurs in the sense of\r\n‘tilled lands.’ But it is chiefly in similes or idyllic scenes that we\r\nget glimpses of farming[23] operations. Thus we have ploughing, reaping,\r\nbinding, threshing, winnowing. Most striking of all is the passage in\r\nwhich the work of irrigation[24] is graphically described. There is no\r\nreason to suppose that any of the workers in these scenes are slaves:\r\nthey would seem to be wage-earners. But I must admit that, if slaves were\r\nemployed under the free workers, the poet would very likely not mention\r\nsuch a detail: that is, if slavery were a normal institution taken for\r\ngranted. For the present I assume only free labour in these cases. We are\r\nmade aware of a clear social difference between the rich and powerful\r\nemployer and the employed labourer. The mowers are at work in the field\r\nof some rich man[25] (ἀνδρὸς μάκαρος κατ’ ἄρουραν), who does not appear\r\nto lend a hand himself. Or again in the close of a ruler (τέμενος\r\nβασιλήιον)[26], with binders following them, a busy scene. The βασιλεὺς\r\nhimself stands watching them in dignified silence, staff in hand. There\r\nis nothing here to suggest that the small working farmer was a typical\r\nfigure in the portraiture of rural life. Flocks and herds are of great\r\nimportance, indeed the ox is a normal standard of value. But the herdsmen\r\nare mean freemen. Achilles is disgusted[27] at the prospect of being\r\ndrowned by Scamander ‘like a young swineherd swept away by a stream in\r\nflood.’ For the heroes of the poem are warrior-lords: the humble toilers\r\nof daily life are of no account beside them.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the fact of slavery stands out clearly, and also its connexion\r\nwith the fact of capture in war. The normal way of dealing with enemies\r\nis to slay the men and enslave the women. The wife of a great warrior has\r\nmany handmaidens, captives of her lord’s prowess. A slave-trade exists,\r\nand we hear of males being spared[28] and ‘sold abroad’: for they are\r\nsent ‘to islands far away’ or ‘beyond the salt sea.’ We do not find male\r\nslaves with the army: perhaps we may guess that they were not wanted.\r\nA single reference to δμῶες (properly slave-captives) appears in XIX\r\n333, where Achilles, speaking of his property at home in Phthia, says\r\nκτῆσιν ἐμὴν δμῶάς τε. But we cannot be certain that these slaves are\r\nfarm-hands. We can only reflect that a slave bought and paid for was not\r\nlikely to be fed in idleness or put to the lightest work. In general it\r\nseems that what weighed upon the slave, male or female, was the pressure\r\nof constraint, the loss of freedom, not the fear of cruel treatment.\r\nWhat Hector keeps from the Trojans[29] is the ‘day of constraint,’ ἦμαρ\r\nἀναγκαῖον, also expressed by δούλιον ἦμαρ. Viewed from the other side we\r\nfind enslavement consisting in a taking away[30] the ‘day of freedom,’\r\nἐλεύθερον ἦμαρ. The words δούλην III 409 and ἀνδραπόδεσσι VII 475 are\r\nisolated cases of substantives in passages the genuineness of which has\r\nbeen questioned. On the whole it is I think not an unfair guess that, if\r\nthe poet had been depicting the life of this same Greek society in their\r\nhomeland, and not under conditions of present war, we should have found\r\nmore references to slavery as a working institution. As it is, we get\r\na momentary glimpse[31] of neighbour landowners, evidently on a small\r\nscale, engaged in a dispute concerning their boundaries, measuring-rod\r\nin hand; and nothing to shew whether such persons supplied the whole of\r\ntheir own labour in tillage or supplemented it by employing hired men or\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\n=The Odyssey= is generally held to be of later date than the Iliad. A far\r\nmore important distinction is that its scenes are not episodes of war. A\r\ncurious difference of terms[32] is seen in the case of the word οἰκῆες,\r\nwhich in the Iliad seems to mean ‘house-folk’ including both free and\r\nslave, in the Odyssey to mean slaves only. But as to the condition of\r\nslaves there is practically no difference. A conquered foe was spared on\r\nthe battlefield by grace of the conqueror, whose ownership of his slave\r\nwas unlimited: and this unlimited right could be conveyed by sale[33]\r\nto a third party. We find Odysseus ready to consign offending slaves[34]\r\nto torture mutilation or death. In the story of his visit to Troy[35] as\r\na spy we hear that he passed for a slave, and that part of his disguise\r\nconsisted in the marks of flogging. Yet the relations of master and\r\nmistress to their slaves are most kindly in ordinary circumstances. The\r\nfaithful slave is a type glorified in the Odyssey: loyalty is the first\r\nvirtue of a slave, and it is disloyalty, however shewn, that justifies\r\nthe master’s vengeance. For they live on intimate terms[36] with their\r\nmaster and mistress and are trusted to a wonderful degree. In short\r\nwe may say that the social atmosphere of the Odyssey is full of mild\r\nslavery, but that in the background there is always the grim possibility\r\nof atrocities committed by absolute power. And we have a trace even\r\nof secondary[37] slavery: for the swineherd, himself a slave, has an\r\nunder-slave of his own, bought with his own goods from slave-dealers\r\nwhile his own master was abroad. Naturally enough we find slaves classed\r\nas a part of the lord’s estate. Odysseus hopes[38] that before he dies\r\nhe may set eyes on his property, his slaves and his lofty mansion. But\r\nanother and perhaps socially more marked distinction seems implied in\r\nthe suitors’ question[39] about Telemachus—‘who were the lads that went\r\nwith him on his journey? were they young nobles of Ithaca, or his own\r\nhired men and slaves (θῆτές τε δμῶές τε)?’ The answer is that they were\r\n‘the pick of the community, present company excepted.’ The wage-earner\r\nand the slave do not seem to be parted by any broad social line. Indeed\r\ncivilization had a long road yet to travel before levelling movement\r\namong the free classes drew a vital distinction between them on the one\r\nside and slaves on the other.\r\n\r\nFree workers of various kinds are often referred to, and we are, owing\r\nto the circumstances of the story, brought more into touch with them\r\nthan in the Iliad. Handicraftsmen[40] are a part of the life of the\r\ntime, and we must assume the smith the carpenter and the rest of the\r\nmales to be free: female slaves skilled in working wool do not justify\r\nus in supposing that the corresponding men are slaves. Beside these are\r\nother men who practise a trade useful to the community, ‘public-workers’\r\n(δημιοεργοί)[41], but not necessarily handworkers. Thus we find the\r\nseer, the leech, the bard, classed with the carpenter as persons whom\r\nall men would readily entertain as guests; the wandering beggar none\r\nwould invite. The last is a type of ‘mean freeman,’ evidently common in\r\nthat society. He is too much akin to the suppliant, whom religion[42]\r\nprotects, to be roughly shewn the door: he is αἰδοῖος ἀλήτης[43],\r\nand trades on the reverence felt for one who appeals as stranger to\r\nhospitable custom. Thus he picks up a living[44] from the scraps and\r\noffals of great houses. But he is despised, and, what concerns us here,\r\ndespised[45] not only for his abject poverty but for his aversion to\r\nhonest work. That the poet admires industry is clear, and is curiously\r\nillustrated by his contrasted pictures of civilization and barbarism.\r\nIn Phaeacia are the fenced-in gardens[46] that supply Alcinous and his\r\npeople with never-failing fruits: the excellence of their naval craftsmen\r\nis expressed in the ‘yarn’ of ships that navigate themselves. In the land\r\nof the Cyclopes, nature provides[47] them with corn and wine, but they\r\nneither sow nor plough. They have flocks of sheep and goats. They have\r\nno ships or men to build them. They live in caves, isolated savages with\r\nno rudiments of civil life. It is not too much to say that the poet is\r\na believer in work and a contemner of idleness: the presence of slaves\r\ndoes not suggest that the free man is to be lazy. Odysseus boasts of his\r\nactivities (δρηστοσύνη)[48]. He is ready to split wood and lay a fire, to\r\nprepare and serve a meal, and in short to wait on the insolent suitors as\r\ninferiors do on nobles. Of course he is still the unknown wanderer: but\r\nthe contrast[49] between him and the genuine beggar Irus is an effective\r\npiece of by-play in the poem.\r\n\r\nTurning to agriculture, we may note that it fills no small place. Wheat\r\nand barley, pounded or ground to meal, seem to furnish the basis of\r\ncivilized diet. The Cyclops[50] does not look like a ‘bread-eating man,’\r\nand wine completely upsets him to his ruin. Evidently the bounty of\r\nnature has been wasted on such a savage. But the cultivation of cereal\r\ncrops is rather assumed than emphasized in the pictures of Greek life. We\r\nhear of tilled lands (ἔργα)[51], and farm-labour (ἔργον)[52] is mentioned\r\nas too wearisome for a high-spirited warrior noble. The tired and hungry\r\nplowman[53] appears in a simile. But the favourite culture is that of the\r\nvine and olive and other fruits in orchards carefully fenced and tended.\r\nOne of the suitors makes a jesting offer[54] to the unknown Odysseus\r\n‘Stranger, would you be willing to serve for hire (θητευέμεν), if I took\r\nyou on, in an outlying field—you shall have a sufficient wage—gathering\r\nstuff for fences and planting tall trees? I would see that you were\r\nregularly fed clothed and shod. No, you are a ne’er-do-weel (ἔργα κάκ’\r\nἔμμαθες) and will not do farm-work (ἔργον): you prefer to go round\r\ncringing for food to fill your insatiate belly.’ This scornful proposal\r\nsets the noble’s contempt for wage-earning labour in a clear light. And\r\nthe shade of Achilles, repudiating[55] the suggestion that it is a great\r\nthing to be a ruler among the dead in the ghostly world, says ‘I had\r\nrather be one bound to the soil, serving another for hire, employed by\r\nsome landless man of little property, than be king of all the dead.’ He\r\nis speaking strongly: to work for hire, a mean destiny at best, is at its\r\nmeanest when the employer is a man with no land-lot of his own (ἄκληρος),\r\npresumably occupying on precarious tenure a bit of some lord’s estate.\r\nAfter such utterances we cannot wonder that as we saw above, θῆτες and\r\nδμῶες are mentioned[56] in the same breath.\r\n\r\nThat slaves are employed on the farm is clear enough. When Penelope\r\nsends for old Dolius[57], a _servus dotalis_ of hers (to use the Roman\r\nexpression) she adds ‘who is in charge of my fruit-garden,’ So too the\r\naged Laertes, living a hard life on his farm, has a staff of slaves[58]\r\nto do his will, and their quarters and farm duties are a marked detail of\r\nthe picture. The old man, in dirty rags like a slave, is a contrast[59]\r\nto the garden, in which every plant and tree attests the devoted toil\r\nof his gardeners under his own skilled direction. Odysseus, as yet\r\nunrecognized by his father, asks him how he comes to be in such a mean\r\nattire, though under it he has the look of a king. Then he drops this\r\ntone and says ‘but tell me, whose slave[60] are you, and who owns the\r\norchard you are tending?’ The hero knows his father, but to preserve\r\nfor the present his own incognito he addresses him as the slave that\r\nhe appears to be. Now if garden work was done by slaves, surely the\r\nrougher operations of corn-growing were not confined to free labour, and\r\nslaves pass unmentioned as a matter of course. Or are we to suppose that\r\nfree labour had been found more economical in the long run, and so was\r\nemployed for the production of a staple food? I can hardly venture to\r\nattribute so mature a view to the society of the Odyssey. We must not\r\nforget that animal food, flesh and milk, was an important element of\r\ndiet, and that the management of flocks and herds was therefore a great\r\npart of rustic economy. But the herdsmen in charge are slaves, such as\r\nEumaeus, bought in his youth by Laertes[61] of Phoenician kidnappers.\r\nIn romancing about his own past experiences Odysseus describes a raid\r\nin Egypt, and how the natives rallied[62] and took their revenge. ‘Many\r\nof our company they slew: others they took alive into the country, to\r\nserve them in forced labour.’ As the ravaging of their ‘beautiful farms’\r\nwas a chief part of the raiders’ offence, the labour exacted from these\r\ncaptives seems most probably agricultural.\r\n\r\nAn interesting question arises in reference to the faithful slaves, the\r\nswineherd and the goatherd. When Odysseus promises them rewards in the\r\nevent of his destroying the suitors with their help, does this include\r\nan offer of freedom? Have we here, as some have thought, a case of\r\nmanumission—of course in primitive form, without the legal refinements\r\nof later times? The promise is made[63] so to speak in the character\r\nof a father-in-law: ‘I will provide you both with wives and give you\r\npossessions and well-built houses near to me, and you shall in future be\r\nto me comrades and brothers of Telemachus.’ The ‘brotherhood’ suggested\r\nsounds as if it must imply freedom. But does it? Eumaeus had been\r\nbrought up[64] by Laertes as the playmate of his daughter Ctimene; yet\r\nhe remained nevertheless a slave. Earlier in the poem Eumaeus, excusing\r\nthe poor entertainment that he can offer the stranger (Odysseus), laments\r\nthe absence[65] of his lord, ‘who’ he says ‘would have shewn me hearty\r\naffection and given me possessions such as a kindly lord gives his slave\r\n(οἰκῆι), a house and a land-lot (κλῆρον) and a wife of recognized worth\r\n(πολυμνήστην), as a reward for laborious and profitable service.’ Here\r\nalso there is no direct reference to an expected grant of freedom: nor\r\ndo I think that it is indirectly implied. It is no doubt tempting to\r\ndetect in these passages the germ of the later manumission. But it is not\r\neasy to say why, in a world of little groups ruled by noble chiefs, the\r\ngift of freedom should have been a longed-for boon. However high-born\r\nthe slave might have been in his native land, in Ithaca he was simply a\r\nslave. If by belonging to a lord he got material comfort and protection,\r\nwhat had he to gain by becoming a mere wage-earner? surely nothing. I can\r\nsee no ground for believing that in the society of the ‘heroic’ age the\r\nbare name of freedom was greatly coveted. It was high birth that really\r\nmattered, but the effect of this would be local: nothing would make\r\nEumaeus, though son of a king, noble in Ithaca. No doubt the slave might\r\nbe at the mercy of a cruel lord. Such a slave would long for freedom, but\r\nsuch a lord was not likely to grant it. On the whole, it is rash to read\r\nmanumission into the poet’s words.\r\n\r\nReviewing the evidence presented by these ‘Homeric’ poems, it may be\r\nwell to insist on the obvious truism that we are not dealing with formal\r\ntreatises, charged with precise definitions and accurate statistics. The\r\ninformation given by the poet drops out incidentally while he is telling\r\nhis tale and making his characters live. It is all the more genuine\r\nbecause it is not furnished in support of a particular argument: but it\r\nis at the same time all the less complete. And it is not possible to say\r\nhow far this or that detail may have been coloured by imagination. Still,\r\nallowing freely for the difficulty suggested by these considerations, I\r\nthink we are justified in drawing a general inference as to the position\r\nof handworkers, particularly on the land, in Greek ‘heroic’ society as\r\nconceived by the poet. If the men who practise handicrafts are freemen,\r\nand their presence welcome, this does not exalt them to anything like\r\nequality with the warrior nobles and chiefs. And in agriculture the\r\nlabourer is either a slave or a wage-earner of a very dependent kind. The\r\nlord shews no inclination to set his own hand to the plough. When one of\r\nthe suitors derisively invites the supposed beggar to abandon his idle\r\nvagrancy for a wage-earning ‘job on the land,’ the disguised Odysseus\r\nretorts[66] ‘Ah, if only you and I could compete in a match as reapers\r\nhard at work fasting from dawn to dark, or at ploughing a big field with\r\na pair of full-fed spirited oxen,—you would soon see what I could do.’ He\r\nadds that, if it came to war, his prowess would soon silence the sneer\r\nat his begging for food instead of working. Now, does the hero imply\r\nthat he would really be willing to reap or plough? I do not think so:\r\nwhat he means is that he is conscious of that reserve of bodily strength\r\nwhich appears later in the poem, dramatically shewn in the bending of the\r\nfamous bow.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. HESIOD.\r\n\r\n=Hesiod, Works and Days.= Whether this curious poem belongs in its\r\npresent shape to the seventh century BC, or not, I need not attempt to\r\ndecide. It seems certain that it is later than the great Homeric poems,\r\nbut is an early work, perhaps somewhat recast and interpolated, yet in\r\nits main features representing conditions and views of a society rural,\r\nhalf-primitive, aristocratic. I see no reason to doubt that it may fairly\r\nbe cited in evidence for my present purpose. The scene of the ‘Works’ is\r\nin Boeotia: the works (ἔργα) are operations of farming, and the precepts\r\nchiefly saws of rustic wisdom. Poverty[67] is the grim spectre that\r\nhaunts the writer, conscious of the oppressions of the proud and the\r\nhardness of a greedy world. Debt, want, beggary, must be avoided at all\r\ncosts. They can only be avoided[68] by thrift, forethought, watchfulness,\r\npromptitude that never procrastinates, and toil that never ceases.\r\nAnd the mere appeal to self-interest is reinforced by recognizing the\r\nstimulus of competition (ἔρις)[69] which in the form of honest rivalry\r\nis a good influence. The poet represents himself as owner of a land-lot\r\n(κλῆρος)[70], part of a larger estate, the joint patrimony of his brother\r\nPerses and himself: this estate has already been divided, but points\r\nof dispute still remain. Hesiod suggests that Perses has been wronging\r\nhim with the help of bribed ‘kings.’ But wrongdoing is not the true\r\nroad to wellbeing. A dinner of herbs and a clear conscience are the\r\nbetter way. As the proverb says ‘half is more than the whole.’ Perses is\r\ntreated to much good advice, the gist of which is first and foremost an\r\nexhortation[71] to work (ἐργάζευ), that is, work on the land, in which\r\nis the source of honourable wealth. Personal labour is clearly meant: it\r\nis in the sweat[72] of his brow that the farmer is to thrive. Such is\r\nthe ordinance of the gods. Man is meant to resemble[73] the worker bee,\r\nnot the worthless drone. It is not ἔργον but idleness (ἀεργίη) that is\r\na reproach. Get wealth[74] by working, and the idler will want to rival\r\nyou: honour and glory attend on wealth. Avoid delays[75] and vain talk:\r\nthe procrastinator is never sure of a living; for he is always hoping,\r\nwhen he should act. Whether sowing or ploughing or mowing, off with\r\nyour outer[76] garment, if you mean to get your farm-duties done in due\r\nseason. The farmer must rise early, and never get behindhand with his\r\nwork: to be in time, and never caught napping by changes of weather, is\r\nhis duty.\r\n\r\nHere is a picture of humble and strenuous life, very different from the\r\nscenes portrayed in the ‘heroic’ epics. It seems to belong to a later and\r\nless warlike age. But the economic and social side of life is in many\r\nrespects little changed. The free handicraftsmen seem much the same.\r\nJealousy of rivals[77] in the same trade—potter, carpenter, beggar, or\r\nbard—is a touch that attests their freedom. The smith, the weaver, the\r\nshoemaker, and the shipwright, are mentioned[78] also. Seafaring[79] for\r\npurposes of gain illustrates what men will dare in quest of wealth. You\r\nshould not cast a man’s poverty[80] in his teeth: but do not fancy that\r\nmen will give you[81] of their store, if you and your family fall into\r\npoverty. Clearly the beggar is not more welcome than he was in the world\r\nof the Odyssey. Suppliant and stranger are protected[82] by religion, and\r\na man should honour his aged father, if he would see good days. A motive\r\nsuggested for careful service of the gods is ‘that you may buy another’s\r\nestate[83] and not another buy yours’—that is, that the gods may give\r\nyou increase. Just so you should keep a watch-dog, that thieves[84] may\r\nnot steal your goods by night. Hesiod’s farmer is to keep the social and\r\nreligious rules and usages—but he is before all things a keen man of\r\nbusiness, no Roman more so.\r\n\r\nThe labour employed by this close-fisted countryman is partly free\r\npartly slave. In a passage[85] of which the exact rendering is disputed\r\nthe hired man (θῆτα) and woman (ἔριθον) are mentioned as a matter of\r\ncourse. For a helper (ἀνδρὶ φίλῳ)[86] his wage must be secure (ἄρκιος)\r\nas stipulated. References to slaves (δμῶες)[87] are more frequent, and\r\nthe need of constant watchfulness, to see that they are not lazy and are\r\nproperly fed housed and rested, is insisted on. The feeding of cattle and\r\nslaves is regulated according to their requirements in different seasons\r\nof the year: efficiency is the object, and evidently experience is the\r\nguide. Of female slaves there is no certain[88] mention: indeed there\r\ncould be little demand for domestic attendants in the farmer’s simple\r\nhome. Such work as weaving[89] is to be done by his wife. For the farmer\r\nis to marry, though the risks[90] of that venture are not hidden from\r\nthe poet, who gives plain warnings as to the exercise of extreme care in\r\nmaking a suitable choice. The operations of agriculture are the usual\r\nploughing sowing reaping threshing and the processes of the vineyard and\r\nthe winepress. Oxen sheep and mules form the live-stock. Corn is the\r\nstaple[91] diet, with hay as fodder for beasts.\r\n\r\nLooking on the picture as a whole, we see that the Hesiodic farmer is to\r\nbe a model of industry and thrift. Business, not sentiment, is the note\r\nof his character. His function is to survive in his actual circumstances;\r\nthat is, in a social and economic environment of normal selfishness. If\r\nhis world is not a very noble one, it is at least eminently practical.\r\nHe is a true αὐτουργός, setting his own hand to the plough, toiling for\r\nhimself on his own land, with slaves and other cattle obedient to his\r\nwill. It is perhaps not too much to say that he illustrates a great\r\ntruth bearing on the labour-question,—that successful exploitation of\r\nother men’s labour is, at least in semi-primitive societies, only to\r\nbe achieved by the man who shares the labour himself. And it is to be\r\nnoted that he attests the existence of wage-earning hands as well as\r\nslaves. I take this to mean that there were in his rustic world a number\r\nof landless freemen compelled to make a living as mere farm labourers.\r\nThat we hear so much less of this class in later times is probably to be\r\naccounted for by the growth of cities and the absorption of such persons\r\nin urban occupations and trades.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. STRAY NOTES FROM EARLY POETS.\r\n\r\nA few fragments may be cited as of interest, bearing on our subject.\r\nThe most important are found in the remains[92] of Solon, illustrating\r\nthe land-question as he saw and faced it at the beginning of the sixth\r\ncentury BC. The poets of the seventh and sixth centuries reflect the\r\nproblems of an age of unrest, among the causes of which the introduction\r\nof metallic coinage, susceptible of hoarding and unaffected by weather,\r\nplayed a great part. Poverty, debt and slavery of debtors, hardship,\r\nbegging, the insolence and oppression of rich and greedy creditors, are\r\ncommon topics. The sale of free men into slavery abroad is lamented by\r\nSolon, who claims to have restored many such victims by his measures of\r\nreform. In particular, he removed encumbrances on land, thus setting\r\nfree the small farmers who were in desperate plight owing to debt. The\r\nexact nature and scope of his famous reform is a matter of dispute.\r\nWhether he relieved freeholders from a burden of debt, or emancipated\r\nthe clients[93] of landowning nobles from dependence closely akin to\r\nserfdom, cannot be discussed here, and does not really bear on the matter\r\nin hand. In either case the persons relieved were a class of working\r\nfarmers, and the economic reform was the main thing: political reform was\r\nof value as tending to secure the economic boon. It is remarkable that\r\nSolon, enumerating a number of trades (practically the old Homeric and\r\nHesiodic list), speaks of them merely as means of escaping the pressure\r\nof poverty, adding ‘and another man[94] is yearly servant to those\r\ninterested in ploughing, and furrows land planted with fruit-trees.’ This\r\nman seems to be a wage-earner (θὴς) working for a large farmer, probably\r\nthe owner of a landed estate in the rich lowland (πεδιάς) of Attica. The\r\nsmall farmers were mostly confined to the rocky uplands. Evidently it is\r\nnot manual labour that is the hardship, but the dependent position of\r\nthe hired man working on another’s land. The hard-working independent\r\npeasant, willing to till stony land for his own support, is the type that\r\nSolon encouraged and Peisistratus[95] approved.\r\n\r\nThe life of such peasant farmers was at best a hard one, and little\r\ndesired by men living under easier conditions. Two fragments from Ionia\r\nexpress views of dwellers in that rich and genial land. =Phocylides= of\r\nMiletus in one of his wise counsels says ‘if you desire wealth, devote\r\nyour care to a fat farm (πίονος ἀγροῦ), for the saying is that a farm is\r\na horn of plenty.’ The bitter =Hipponax= of Ephesus describes a man as\r\nhaving lived a gluttonous life and so eaten up his estate (τὸν κλῆρον):\r\nthe result is that he is driven to dig a rocky hillside and live on\r\ncommon figs and barley bread—mere slave’s fodder (δούλιον χόρτον). Surely\r\nthe ‘fat farm’ was not meant to be worked by the owner singlehanded; and\r\nthe ‘slave’s fodder’ suggests the employment of slaves. Ionia was a home\r\nof luxury and ease.\r\n\r\nThe oft-quoted scolion of the Cretan =Hybrias= illustrates the point\r\nof view of the warrior class in more military communities. His wealth\r\nis in sword spear and buckler. It is with these tools that he does his\r\nploughing reaping or vintage. That is, he has command of the labour of\r\nothers, and enjoys their produce. We shall speak below of the well-known\r\nlords and serfs of Crete.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. TRACES OF SERFDOM IN GREEK STATES.\r\n\r\nBefore passing on to the times in which the merits of a free\r\nfarmer-class, from military and political points of view, became a\r\nmatter of general and conscious consideration, it is desirable to refer\r\nbriefly to the recorded cases of agricultural serfdom in Greek states.\r\nFor the rustic serf is a type quite distinct from the free farmer, the\r\nhired labourer, or the slave; though the language of some writers is\r\nloose, and does not clearly mark the distinction. Six well-known cases\r\npresent themselves, in connexion with Sparta, Crete, Argos, Thessaly,\r\nSyracuse, and Heraclea on the Pontus. Into the details of these systems\r\nit is not necessary to enter, interesting though many of them are. The\r\nimportant feature common to them all is the delegation of agricultural\r\nlabour. A stronger or better-organized people become masters of a weaker\r\npopulation, conquering their country by force of arms, and sparing the\r\nconquered on certain terms. The normal effect of the compact is that the\r\nconquerors are established as a ruling warrior class, whose subsistence\r\nis provided by the labour of the subject people. These subjects remain\r\non the land as farmers, paying a fixed quota of their produce to their\r\nmasters. Some are serfs of the state, and pay their dues to the state\r\nauthorities: some are serfs of individuals, and pay to their lords.\r\nIn either case they are strictly attached to the land, and cannot be\r\nsold out of the country. This clearly marks off the serf from the slave\r\nheld in personal bondage. In some cases certainly, probably in all, the\r\nwarrior class (at least the wealthier of them) had also slaves for their\r\nown personal service. The serf-system differs from a caste-system. Both,\r\nit is true, are hereditary systems, or have a strong tendency to become\r\nso. The ruling class do not easily admit deserving subjects into their\r\nown ranks. And they take precautions to hinder the degradation of their\r\nequals into lower conditions through poverty. The warrior’s land-lot\r\n(κλᾶρος), the sale of which is forbidden, is a favourite institution\r\nfor the purpose. That such warrior aristocracies could not be kept up\r\nin vigour for an indefinite time, was to be proved by experience. Their\r\nduration depended on external as well as internal conditions. Hostile\r\ninvasion might destroy the efficiency of state regulations, however\r\nwell adapted to keep the serfs under control. Sparta always feared her\r\nHelots, and it was essential to keep an enemy out of Laconia. Early in\r\nthe history of Syracuse the unprivileged masses were supported by the\r\nserfs in their rising against the squatter-lords, the γαμόροι whose great\r\nestates represented the allotments of the original settlers. In Crete\r\nand Thessaly matters were complicated by lack of a central authority.\r\nThere were a number of cities: subordination and cooperation were alike\r\nhard to secure, and the history of both groups is a story of jealousy,\r\ncollisions, and weakness. The Thessalian Penestae often rebelled. The two\r\nclasses of Cretan[96] serfs (public and private) were kept quiet partly\r\nby rigid exclusion from all training of a military kind, partly by their\r\nmore favourable condition: but the insular position of Crete was perhaps\r\na factor of equal importance. The long control of indigenous barbarian\r\nserfs by the city of Heraclea was probably the result of similar causes.\r\n\r\nBut in all these cases it is conquest that produces the relation between\r\nthe tiller of the soil and his overlord. Whether the serf is regarded\r\nas a weaker Greek or as a Barbarian (non-Greek) is not at present the\r\nmain question from my point of view. The notion of castes, belonging\r\nto the same society and influenced by the same racial and religious\r\ntraditions, but each performing a distinct function—priestly military\r\nagricultural etc.—as in ancient India, is another thing altogether. Caste\r\nseparates functions, but the division is in essence collateral. Serfdom\r\nis a delegation of functions, and is a compulsory subordination. That\r\nthe Greeks of the seventh and sixth centuries BC were already becoming\r\nconscious of a vital difference between other races and themselves, is\r\nfairly certain. It was soon to express itself in the common language.\r\nContact with Persia was soon to crystallize this feeling into a moral\r\nantipathy, a disgust and contempt that found voice in the arrogant claim\r\nthat while nature’s law justifies the ruling of servile Barbarians by\r\nfree Greeks, a reversal of the relation is an unnatural monstrosity. Yet\r\nI cannot discover that Greeks ever gave up enslaving brother Greeks.\r\nCallicratidas in the field and Plato in his school might protest against\r\nthe practice; it still remained the custom in war to sell as slaves\r\nthose, Greek or Barbarian, whom the sword had spared. We shall also find\r\ncases in which the remnant of the conquered were left in their homes but\r\nreduced to the condition of cultivating serfs.\r\n\r\nAmong the little that is known of the ancient Etruscans, whose power was\r\nonce widely extended in Italy, is the fact that they dwelt in cities and\r\nruled a serf population who lived chiefly in the country. The ruling\r\nrace were apparently invaders not akin to any of the Italian stocks:\r\ntheir subjects probably belonged to the old Ligurian race, in early times\r\nspread over a large part of the peninsula. That the Etruscan cities\r\nrecognized a common interest, but in practice did not support each other\r\nconsistently, was the chief cause of their gradual weakening and final\r\nfall. Noble lords with warlike traditions had little bent for farm life\r\nor sympathy with the serfs who tilled the soil. The two classes seem to\r\nhave kept to their own[97] languages, and the Etruscan gradually died out\r\nunder the supremacy of Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. HERODOTUS.\r\n\r\n=Herodotus=, writing in the first half of the fifth century BC, partly\r\nrecording the results of his own travels, partly dependent on the\r\nwork of his predecessors, is a witness of great value. In him we find\r\nthe contrast and antipathy[98] of Greek and Barbarian an acknowledged\r\nfact, guiding and dominating Greek sentiment. Unhappily he yields us\r\nvery little evidence bearing on the present subject. To slavery and\r\nslave-trade he often refers without comment: these are matters of\r\ncourse. The servile character of oriental peoples subject to Persia is\r\ncontemptuously described[99] through the mouth of the Greek queen of\r\nHalicarnassus. Nor does he spare the Ionian Greeks, whose jealousies and\r\nconsequent inefficiency made them the unworthy tools of Persian ambition;\r\na sad contrast to those patriotic Greeks of old Hellas who, fired by\r\nthe grand example of Athens, fought for their freedom and won it in the\r\nface of terrible odds. The disgust—a sort of physical loathing—with\r\nwhich the free Greek, proud of training his body to perfection, regarded\r\ncorporal mutilation as practised in the East, is illustrated by such\r\npassages[100] as that in which the Persians are astounded at the Greek\r\nathletic competitions for a wreath of olive leaves, and that in which he\r\ncoolly tells the story of the eunuch’s revenge. But all this, interesting\r\nas giving us his point of view, does not help us in clearing up the\r\nrelations of free and slave labour. As for handicrafts, it is enough\r\nto refer to the well-known passage[101] in which, while speaking of\r\nEgypt, he will not decide whether the Greeks got their contempt for\r\nmanual trades from the Egyptians or not. That the Greeks, above all the\r\nSpartans, do despise χειρωναξίαι, is certain; but least true of the\r\nCorinthians. Barbarians in general respect the warrior class among their\r\nown folk and regard manual trades as ignoble. So the source of Greek\r\nprejudice is doubtful. That the craftsmen are free is clear from the\r\nwhole context. It is remarkable that in enumerating seven classes of the\r\nEgyptian population he mentions no class[102] as devoted to the tillage\r\nof the soil, but two of herdsmen, in charge of cattle and swine. Later\r\nauthorities mention[103] the γεωργοί, and connect them with the military\r\nclass, rightly, it would seem: for Herodotus[104] refers to the farms\r\ngranted by the kings to this class. They are farmer-soldiers. It would\r\nseem that they were free, so far as any Egyptian could be called free,\r\nand worked their land themselves. If this inference be just, we may\r\nobserve that a Greek thought it a fact worth noting. Was this owing to\r\nthe contrast[105] offered by systems of serfage in the Greek world?\r\n\r\nIt is curious that wage-labour is hardly ever directly mentioned. In\r\ndescribing[106] the origin of the Macedonian kings, who claimed descent\r\nfrom an Argive stock, he says that three brothers, exiles from Argos,\r\ncame to Macedon. There they served the king for wages as herdsmen in\r\ncharge of his horses cattle sheep and goats. The simplicity of the royal\r\nhousehold is emphasized as illustrating the humble scale of ancient\r\nmonarchies. Alarmed by a prodigy, the king calls his servants (τοὺς\r\nθῆτας) and tells them to leave his country. The sequel does not concern\r\nus here: we need only note that work for wages is referred to as a\r\nmatter of course. The same relation is probably meant in the case of the\r\nArcadian deserters[107] who came to Xerxes after Thermopylae, in need of\r\nsustenance (βίου) and wishing to get work (ἐνεργοὶ εἶναι). But the term\r\nθητεύειν is not used. And the few Athenians who stayed behind[108] in the\r\nAcropolis when Athens was evacuated, partly through sheer poverty (ὑπ’\r\nἀσθενείης βίου), would seem to be θῆτες. It is fair to infer that hired\r\nlabour is assumed as a normal fact in Greek life. For the insistence on\r\npoverty[109] as naturally endemic (σύντροφος) in Hellas, only overcome by\r\nthe manly qualities (ἀρετὴ) developed in the conquest of hard conditions\r\nby human resourcefulness (σοφίη), shews us the background of the picture\r\npresent to the writer’s mind. It is his way of telling us that the\r\nquestion of food-supply was a serious one. Out of her own soil Hellas was\r\nonly able to support a thin population. Hence Greek forces were absurdly\r\nsmall compared with the myriads of Persia: but the struggle for existence\r\nhad strung them up to such efficiency and resolute love of freedom that\r\nthey were ready to face fearful odds.\r\n\r\nThe passage occurs in the reply of Demaratus the Spartan to a question of\r\nXerxes, and refers more particularly to Sparta. In respect of courage\r\nand military efficiency the claim is appropriate: but poverty was surely\r\ncharacteristic of nearly all the European Hellas, and the language on\r\nthat point is strictly correct, probably representing the writer’s\r\nown view. It is also quite consistent with the statement[110] that in\r\nearly times, before the Athenians had as yet driven all the indigenous\r\npopulation out of Attica, neither the Athenians nor the Greeks generally\r\nhad slaves (οἰκέτας). The context seems to indicate that domestic slaves\r\nare specially meant. I do not lay much stress on this allegation, urged\r\nas it is in support of a case by one party to the dispute: but it is a\r\ngenuine tradition, which appears again in the later literature. In the\r\ntime of Herodotus there were plenty of domestic slaves. Accordingly he\r\nfinds it worth while to mention[111] that Scythian kings are attended by\r\npersons of their own race, there being no bought servants employed.\r\n\r\nHerodotus is a difficult witness to appraise justly, partly from the\r\noccasional uncertainty as to whether he is really pledging his own\r\nauthority on a point, partly because the value of his authority varies\r\ngreatly on different points. But on the whole I take his evidence\r\nto suggest that agriculture was carried on in Greece either by free\r\nlabouring farmers employing hired men when needed, or by serfs. I do not\r\nsee any evidence to shew that no slaves were employed. The subject of his\r\nbook placed him under no necessity of mentioning them: and I can hardly\r\nbelieve that farm-slavery on a small scale had died out all over Greece\r\nsince the days of Hesiod. Nor do I feel convinced on his authority that\r\nthe poverty of Greece was, so far as mere food is concerned, as extreme\r\nas he makes Demaratus represent it. When the Spartans heard that Xerxes\r\nwas offering the Athenians a separate peace, they were uneasy, and sent\r\na counter-offer[112] on their own behalf. Not content with appealing to\r\nthe Hellenic patriotism of Athens, they said ‘We feel for you in your\r\nloss of two crops and the distress that will last some while yet. But\r\nyou shall have all this made good. We, Spartans and confederates, will\r\nfind food for your wives and your helpless families[113] so long as this\r\nwar lasts.’ Supposing this offer to have been actually made, and to have\r\nbeen capable of execution, surely it implies that there were food-stuffs\r\nto spare in the Peloponnese. It may be that I am making too much of this\r\npassage, and of the one about poverty. The dramatic touch of Herodotus\r\nis present in both, and I must leave the apparent inconsistency between\r\nthem as it stands. The question of Peloponnesian agriculture will come up\r\nagain in connexion with a passage of Thucydides.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. THE TRAGEDIANS.\r\n\r\nThe lives of =Aeschylus= (died 456 BC) =Sophocles= and =Euripides= (both\r\ndied 406 BC) cover a period of stirring events in the history of Greece,\r\nparticularly of Athens. =Aeschylus= had borne his part in the Persian\r\nwars: he was a fighting man when Herodotus was born, and Sophocles a\r\nboy. Euripides saw the rise of Athenian power to its greatest height,\r\nand died with Sophocles on the eve of its fall. These men had seen\r\nstrange and terrible things. Hellas had only beaten off the Persian to\r\nruin herself by her own internecine conflicts. While the hatred and\r\ncontempt for ‘barbarians’ grew from sentiment into something very like\r\na moral principle, Greeks butchered or enslaved brother Greeks on an\r\nunprecedented scale. Greek lands were laid waste by Greek armies: the\r\ndevastation of Attica in particular had serious effects on the politics\r\nand policy of Athens. Athens at length lost her control of the Euxine\r\ncorn trade and was starved out. For the moment a decision was reached:\r\nthe reactionary rural powers, backed by the commercial jealousy of\r\nCorinth, had triumphed. No thoughtful man in Athens during the time when\r\nthe rustic population were crowded into the city, idle and plagued with\r\nsickness, could be indifferent to the strain on democratic institutions.\r\nThis spectacle suggested reflexions that permanently influenced Greek\r\nthought on political subjects. The tendency was to accept democracy\r\nin some form and degree as inevitable in most states, and to seek\r\nsalvation in means of checking the foolish extravagancies of mob-rule.\r\nThe best of these means was the encouragement of farmer-citizens: but\r\nthe circumstances of Greek history made practical success on these lines\r\nimpossible. In practice, oligarchy meant privilege, to which a scattered\r\nfarming population would submit; democracy meant mob-rule sooner or\r\nlater, and the dominance of urban interests. The problem which Plato and\r\nAristotle could not solve was already present in the latter part of the\r\nPeloponnesian war. Aristophanes might ridicule Euripides, but on the\r\ncountry-and-town issue the two were agreed.\r\n\r\n=Aeschylus= indeed furnishes very little to my purpose directly.\r\nThe Greek antipathy to the Barbarian is very clearly marked; but\r\nthe only points worth noting are that in the _Persae_[114] he makes\r\nPersian speakers refer to their own people as βάρβαροι, and that in a\r\nbitter passage of the _Eumenides_ he expresses[115] his loathing of\r\nmutilations and tortures, referring no doubt to Persian cruelties.\r\nAgriculture can hardly be said to be mentioned at all, for the gift\r\nof weather-wisdom[116] is useful to others than the farmer, and the\r\nScythian steppes are untilled land. A fragment, telling of a happy\r\nland[117] where all things grow in plenty unsown without ploughing or\r\ndigging, reminds us of the Odyssey, minus the savages: another, referring\r\nto the advance made in domestication of beasts to relieve men of toil,\r\nmake up the meagre list. All are in connexion with Prometheus. There are\r\ntwo interesting passages[118] in which the word γαμόρος (landholder)\r\noccurs, but merely as an expression for a man with the rights and\r\nresponsibilities of a citizen. There is nothing of tillage. It was\r\nnatural for the champion of the power of the Areopagus to view the\r\ncitizen from the landholding side. He is a respecter of authority, but at\r\nthe same time lays great stress on the duty and importance of deference\r\nto public opinion. This tone runs through the surviving plays, wherever\r\nthe scene of a particular drama may be laid. Athenian conditions are\r\nalways in his mind, and his final judgment appears in the _Eumenides_\r\nas an appeal to all true citizens to combine freedom with order. Ties\r\nof blood, community of religious observances, the relation between\r\ncitizens and aliens, are topics on which he dwells again and again. In\r\ngeneral it is fair to conclude that, while he cheerfully accepted the\r\nfree constitution of Athens as it stood since the democratic reform\r\nof Cleisthenes, he thought that it was quite democratic enough, and\r\nregarded more recent tendencies with some alarm. Now these tendencies, in\r\nparticular the reforms of Ephialtes and Pericles, were certainly in the\r\ndirection of lessening the influence of the Attic farmers and increasing\r\nthat of the urban citizens, who were on the spot to take advantage of\r\nthem. To put it in the briefest form, Aeschylus must be reckoned an\r\nadmirer of the solid and responsible citizens of the old school, men with\r\na stake in the country.\r\n\r\n=Sophocles= also supplies very little. The antipathy of Greeks to\r\nBarbarians appears in a milder form: Aeschylus was naturally more\r\nbitter, having fought against the Persian invader. The doctrine that\r\npublic opinion (of citizens) ought to be respected, that obedience to\r\nconstituted authorities is a duty, in short the principle that freedom\r\nshould be combined with order, is set forth in various passages of\r\ndramatic debate. Yet the scenes of the plays, as those of Aeschylus, are\r\nlaid in legendary ages that knew not democracy. The awful potency of ties\r\nof blood, and the relations of citizen and alien, are topics common to\r\nboth. But I think it may fairly be said that political feeling is less\r\nevident in Sophocles. This is consistent with his traditional character.\r\nIn their attitude towards slavery there is no striking difference: both\r\ntreat it as a matter of course. But in Sophocles there are already\r\nsigns[119] of the questioning that was soon to become outspoken, as to\r\nthe justice of the relation of master and slave. Agriculture is hardly\r\nmentioned. The words γεωργός, γεωργεῖν, γεωργία, are (as in Aeschylus)\r\nnot used. A reference to ploughing occurs in a famous passage[120]\r\ncelebrating the resourcefulness of Man. The herdsman, usually a slave, is\r\nonce[121] spoken of as perhaps a hired servant. One curious passage[122]\r\ncalls for notice. In the _Trachiniae_ the indifference of Heracles to\r\nhis children is compared by his wife Deianira to the conduct of a farmer\r\n(γῄτης) who has got a farm at a distance (ἄρουραν ἔκτοπον) and only\r\nvisits it at seed-time and harvest. The man is apparently a non-resident\r\nlandowner, living presumably in the city (surely Athens is in the poet’s\r\nmind) and working his farm by deputy—a steward—and only inspecting it at\r\nimportant seasons. Whether the labour employed is slave or free, there\r\nis nothing to shew. It is of interest to find the situation sufficiently\r\nreal to be used in a simile. But I infer that the situation, like the\r\nconduct of Heracles, is regarded as exceptional.\r\n\r\n=Euripides= takes us into a very different atmosphere. An age of movement\r\nwas also an age of criticism and inquiry, social religious political\r\nethical. The intellectual leaders came from various parts of the Greek\r\nworld, but the intellectual centre of ‘obstinate questionings’ was\r\nAthens, and their poet Euripides. The use of drama, with plots drawn\r\nfrom ancient legend, as a vehicle for reflexions on human problems,\r\naddressed to a contemporary audience and certain to evoke assent and\r\ndissent, is the regular practice of Euripides. His plays give us a mass\r\nof information as to the questions exercising the minds of thoughtful men\r\nin a stirring period. The point of view is that of the new school, the\r\nenlightened ‘thinkers’ who claimed the right to challenge traditional\r\nprinciples, opinions, prejudices, and institutions, testing them by the\r\ncanons of human reason fearlessly applied. This attitude was naturally\r\nresented by men of the old school, averse to any disturbing influence\r\ntending to undermine the traditional morality, and certain to react\r\nupon politics. Their opposition can still be traced in the comedies of\r\nAristophanes and in various political movements during the Peloponnesian\r\nwar. Among the topics to which the new school turned their attention were\r\ntwo of special interest to Euripides. The power of wealth was shewing\r\nitself in the growth of capitalistic enterprise, an illustration of\r\nwhich is seen in the case of the rich slaveowner Nicias. Poverty[123]\r\nand its disadvantages, sometimes amounting to sheer degradation, was as\r\never a subject of discontent: and this was closely connected with the\r\nposition of free wage-earning labour. At Athens political action took a\r\nstrong line in the direction of utilizing the wealth of the rich in the\r\nservice of the state: for the poor, its dominant tendency was to provide\r\nopportunities of drawing state pay (μισθός), generally a bare living\r\nwage, for the performance of various public duties. The other topic, that\r\nof slavery, had as yet hardly reached the stage of questioning the right\r\nor wrong of that institution as such. But the consciousness that the\r\nslave, like his master, was a blend of human virtues and human vices,—was\r\na man, in short,—was evidently becoming clearer, and suggesting the\r\nconclusion that he must be judged as a man and not as a mere chattel.\r\nOtherwise Euripides would hardly have ventured to bring slaves on the\r\nstage[124] in so sympathetic a spirit, or to utter numerous sayings,\r\nbearing on their merits and failings, in a tone of broad humanity.\r\n\r\nIn such circumstances how came it that there was no sign of a movement\r\nanalogous to modern Abolitionism? If the slave was confessedly a man,\r\nhad he not the rights of a man? The answer is plain. That a man, simply\r\nas a man, had any rights, was a doctrine not yet formulated or clearly\r\nconceived. The antipathy[125] between Greek and Barbarian was a practical\r\nbar to its recognition. The Persian was not likely to moderate his\r\ntreatment of Greeks in his power from any such consideration: superior\r\nforce, nothing less, would induce him to conform to Greek notions of\r\nhumanity. While force was recognized as the sole foundation of right\r\nas against free enemies, there could not be much serious doubt as to\r\nthe right of holding aliens in slavery. But in this questioning age\r\nanother theoretical basis of discussion had been found. Men were testing\r\ninstitutions by asking in reference to each ‘is it a natural[126] growth?\r\ndoes it exist by nature (φύσει)? or is it a conventional status? does it\r\nexist by law (νόμῳ)?’ Here was one of the most unsettling inquiries of\r\nthe period. In reference to slavery we find two conflicting doctrines\r\nbeginning to emerge. One is[127] that all men are born free (φύσει) and\r\nthat slavery is therefore a creation of man’s device (νόμῳ). The other is\r\nthat superior strength is a gift of nature, and therefore the rule of the\r\nweaker[128] by the stronger is according to nature. The conflict between\r\nthese two views was destined to engage some of the greatest minds of\r\nGreece in later years, when the political failure of the Greek states\r\nhad diverted men’s thoughts to problems concerning the individual. For\r\nthe present slavery was taken for granted, but it is evident that the\r\nseeds of future doubt had been sown. Among the stray utterances betraying\r\nuneasiness is the oft-quoted saying[129] of the sophist Alcidamas ‘god\r\nleaves all men free: nature makes no man a slave.’ The speaker was\r\ncontemporary with Euripides, whose sayings are often in much the same\r\ntone, if less direct. A remarkable passage is that in which he makes\r\nHeracles repudiate[130] the myths that represent slavery as existing\r\namong the gods. No god that is a real god has any needs, and such tales\r\nare rubbish—an argument that was destined to reappear later as bearing\r\nupon slavery among men, particularly in connexion with the principles of\r\nthe Cynic school.\r\n\r\nI have said enough as to the point of view from which the questioners,\r\nsuch as Euripides, regarded slavery. It is somewhat surprising that\r\nthe poet’s references to hired labour[131] are very few, and all of a\r\ndepressing kind, treating θητεύειν as almost or quite equivalent to\r\nδουλεύειν. The references or allusions to handicrafts are hardly to\r\nthe point: such men are doubtless conceived as θῆτες, but they would\r\ngenerally direct themselves in virtue of their trade-skill: they are not\r\nhired ‘hands.’ Herdsmen often appear, but generally if not always they\r\nseem to be slaves or serfs. Nor is it clear that the digger (σκαφεύς)\r\nis free; he is referred to[132] as a specimen of the meanest class\r\nof labourer. But in three of the plays there occur passages directly\r\ndescriptive of the poor working farmer, the αὐτουργὸς of whom I have\r\nspoken above. In the _Electra_, the prologue is put in the mouth of\r\nthe poor but well-born αὐτουργὸς to whom the crafty Aegisthus has\r\ngiven Electra in marriage. The scene between husband and wife is one\r\nof peculiar delicacy and interest. The points that concern us here\r\nare these. The princess has been united[133] to a poor and powerless\r\nfreeman. He is fully occupied[134] with the hard labour of his farm,\r\nwhich he apparently cultivates singlehanded. He understands the motive of\r\nAegisthus, and shews his respect for Electra by refraining from conjugal\r\nrights. She in turn respects his nobility, and shews her appreciation by\r\ncheerfully performing[135] the humble duties of a cottar’s wife. When\r\nthe breadwinner (ἐργάτης) comes home from toil, he should find all ready\r\nfor his comfort. He is shocked to see her, a lady of gentle breeding (εὖ\r\nτεθραμμένη) fetch water from the spring and wait upon his needs. But he\r\nhas to accept the situation: the morrow’s dawn[136] shall see him at his\r\nlabour on the land: it is all very well to pray for divine aid, but\r\nto get a living the first thing needful is to work. Now here we have a\r\npicture of the free farmer on a small scale, who lives in a hovel and\r\ndepends on the labour of his own hands. He is the ancient analogue of\r\nthe French peasant, who works harder than any slave, and whose views\r\nare apt to be limited by the circumstances of his daily life. He has no\r\nslaves[137]. Again, the Theban herald in the _Supplices_[138], speaking\r\nof the incapacity of a Demos for the function of government, says ‘but\r\na poor husbandman (γαπόνος ἀνὴρ πένης), even if not stupid, will be\r\ntoo busy to attend to state affairs.’ Here is our toiling rustic, the\r\nideal citizen of statesmen who desire to keep free from popular control.\r\nThe same character appears again in the _Orestes_, on the occasion of\r\na debate in the Argive Assembly (modelled on Athens), as defender of\r\nOrestes. He is described[139] as ‘not of graceful mien, but a manly\r\nfellow, one who seldom visits the city and the market-place, a toiler\r\nwith his hands (αὐτουργός), of the class on whom alone the safety of the\r\ncountry depends; but intelligent and prepared to face the conflict of\r\ndebate, a guileless being of blameless life.’ So vivid is this portrait,\r\nthat the sympathy of the poet with the rustic type of citizen can hardly\r\nbe ignored. Now, why did Euripides take pains to shew this sympathy? I\r\ntake it to be a sign that he saw with regret the declining influence of\r\nthe farmer class in Attic politics.\r\n\r\nCan we go a step further, and detect in these passages any sort of\r\nprotest against a decline in the number of small working farmers, and\r\na growth of exploitation-farming, carried on by stewards directing the\r\nlabour of slaves or hired hands? In the next generation we find this\r\nsystem in use, as indeed it most likely always had been to some extent\r\non the richer soils of lowland Attica. The concentration of the country\r\nfolk in the city during the great war would tend to promote agriculture\r\nby deputy after the return of peace. Deaths, and the diversion of some\r\nfarmers to other pursuits, were likely to leave vacancies in the rural\r\ndemes. Speculators who took advantage of such chances to buy land\r\nwould not as a rule do so with intent to live on the land and work it\r\nthemselves; and aliens were not allowed to hold real estate. It seems\r\nfairly certain that landlords resident in Athens, to whom land was\r\nonly one of many forms of investment, and who either let their land to\r\ntenant-farmers or exploited its cultivation under stewards, were a class\r\nincreased considerably by the effects of the war. We shall see further\r\nreasons below for believing this. Whether Euripides in the passages cited\r\nabove is actually warning or protesting, I do not venture to say: that\r\nhe grasped the significance of a movement beginning under his very eyes,\r\nis surely a probable conjecture.\r\n\r\nThat we should hear little of the employment of slaves in the hard\r\nwork of agriculture, even if the practice were common, is not to be\r\nwondered at. Assuming the existence of slavery, there was no need for\r\nany writer other than a specialist to refer to them. But we have in\r\nthe _Rhesus_ a passage[140] in which Hector forecasts the result of an\r\nattack on the Greeks while embarking: some of them will be slain, and\r\nthe rest, captured and made fast in bonds, will be taught to cultivate\r\n(γαπονεῖν) the fields of the Phrygians. That this use of captives is\r\nnothing extraordinary appears below, when Dolon the spy is bargaining\r\nfor a reward in case of success. To a suggestion that one of the Greek\r\nchiefs should be assigned to him he replies ‘No, hands gently nurtured\r\n(εὖ ’τεθραμμέναι)[141] are unfit for farm-work (γεωργεῖν).’ The notion\r\nof captive Greeks slaving on the land for Asiatic lords is a touch meant\r\nto be provocative of patriotic indignation. And the remark of Dolon\r\nwould surely fall more meaningly on the ears of men acquainted with the\r\npresence of rustic slavery in their own country. To serfage we have a\r\nreference[142] in the _Heraclidae_, but the retainer (πενέστης) is under\r\narms, ‘mobilized,’ not at the time working on the land. His reward, when\r\nhe brings the news of victory, is to be freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. THE ‘CONSTITUTION OF ATHENS’ OR ‘OLD OLIGARCH.’\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable documents that have come down to us bearing\r\nupon Athenian politics is the ‘Constitution[143] of Athens’ wrongly\r\nassigned to Xenophon. It is certainly the work of an earlier writer,\r\nand the date of its composition can be fixed as between 430 and 424 BC.\r\nThus it refers to the first years of the Peloponnesian war, during which\r\nAttica was repeatedly invaded, its rural economy upset, and the manifold\r\nconsequences of overcrowding in the city of refuge were beginning to\r\nshew themselves. Not a few of the ‘better classes’ of Athenian citizens\r\n(οἱ βέλτιστοι) were dissatisfied with the readiness of the Demos,\r\nunder the guidance of Pericles, to carry out a maritime and aggressive\r\npolicy abroad at the cost of sacrificing rural interests at home. For\r\nthe sacrifice fell on the landowners, more particularly on the larger\r\nowners: the compensations[144] of state-pay and chances of plunder might\r\nsuffice for the peasant farmer driven into Athens. At the same time\r\nit was undeniable that the astounding energy displayed by democratic\r\nAthens had surprised the Greek world; and the most discontented Athenian\r\ncould hardly suppress an emotion of patriotic pride. The writer of the\r\npamphlet before us—for a pamphlet it is—was under the influence of these\r\nconflicting feelings. Whether it is right to describe him as an Oligarch\r\ndepends on what that term is taken to connote. That he would greatly\r\nprefer a system[145] under which the educated orderly and honest citizens\r\nshould enjoy greater consideration and power, is evident: also that in\r\nhis view these qualities are normal attributes of the wealthier classes.\r\nFor he finds in poverty the main cause[146] of democratic misdeeds.\r\nThat the masses are ill-informed and lack judgment and self-control,\r\nis the result of their preoccupation with necessities of daily life.\r\nBut from this conviction to aiming at a serious oligarchic revolution\r\nis a long step. The democracy in its less aggressive form, before the\r\nrecent developments owing to the presence of an idle refugee population,\r\nmight conceivably have sufficed for his requirements. He is a prejudiced\r\ncontemporary witness, frank and cynical in the extreme, praising the\r\nDemos for doing the very things that he hates and despises, because those\r\nthings are in the interest of the democracy such as it appears to him:\r\nthey would be fools to act otherwise. For convenience sake I follow Mr\r\nZimmern[147] in calling him the _Old Oligarch_.\r\n\r\nHis disgust at the lack of discipline in the slaves at Athens, and his\r\ningenious explanation[148] of the causes that have led to toleration of\r\nthe nuisance, are very characteristic of his whole attitude. But the\r\nslaves of whom he speaks are those labourers whom their owners allowed\r\nto work for hire in the city and Peiraeus, taking a share of their pay\r\nas rent for their services. Perhaps the state slaves are meant also. He\r\nadmits that you have to put up with the airs of these fellows, who often\r\nbecome men of substance (πλούσιοι δοῦλοι) and think themselves as good\r\nas the citizens. Truth is, the master depends on the return he gets from\r\nhis investment: if the rent comes in regularly, he asks no questions\r\nand the slave is given[149] a free hand. No wonder the bondman jostles\r\nhis betters in the public streets, a state of things inconceivable in\r\norderly Sparta. Now on the face of it this picture has nothing to do with\r\nthe agricultural situation. But let us look further. The stress of the\r\ngreat war had increased the city population. The increased demand for\r\nimported food-stuffs and for materials of war (such as ship-timber) had\r\nundoubtedly increased the demand for dock-labourers, boatmen, porters,\r\ncarters, and other ‘hands.’ Male citizens had enough to do in services by\r\nland and sea. From what source was the extra force of rough able-bodied\r\nlabour recruited? Is it likely that a number of raw barbarian slaves\r\nwere imported for the purpose? I think not; time would be needed to make\r\nthem efficient, and the available shipping had already a difficult task\r\nto keep up the supply of indispensable goods. Is it not much more likely\r\nthat rustic slaves, brought into Athens by their owners, were turned to\r\naccount[150] in another department of labour, thus earning wages for\r\nthemselves while they maintained their masters? The probability of this\r\nview will depend largely on proof that rustic slaves were employed in\r\nAttica under normal conditions at this time. We shall presently see how\r\nthe evidence of Aristophanes bears on the point.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile let us see what references to agriculture are to be found\r\nin this pamphlet. In speaking of the nautical skill[151] now a common\r\naccomplishment among Athenians, the writer remarks that the possession\r\nof estates abroad, and the duties of offices concerned with external\r\naffairs, have something to do with it. Men have to cross the water: they\r\nand their attendants (ἀκόλουθοι) thus pick up skill by experience without\r\nintending it: for it happens time and again that both master and slave\r\n(καὶ αὐτὸν καὶ τὸν οἰκέτην) have to take a turn at the oar. The estates\r\nreferred to are chiefly state-lands allotted to Athenian cleruchs in\r\nconfiscated districts, but also private properties. The voyages to and\r\nfro are nothing exceptional. Whether a man resided on his estate and had\r\nneed to visit Athens, or whether he resided in Athens and had to visit\r\nhis estate from time to time, he must go to sea. It is to be borne in\r\nmind that allottees in cleruchies often let their lands to the former\r\nowners as tenants. In another passage[152] he points out the disadvantage\r\nto Athens, as a maritime power, of not being on an island and so secure\r\nfrom invasion. ‘As things are, those Athenians who farm land or are\r\nwealthy (οἱ γεωργοῦντες καὶ οἱ πλούσιοι) are more inclined to conciliate\r\nthe enemy (ὑπέρχονται = cringe to), while the Demos, well aware that\r\ntheir own belongings are in no danger of destruction, is unconcerned and\r\ndefiant.’ A notable admission, confirmed by other evidence, as we shall\r\nsee. It is to be observed that farmers and wealthy men are coupled\r\ntogether. The class more especially meant are probably those represented\r\nin Aristophanes by the substantial farmers of the _Peace_. But\r\ncapitalists with investments in land are also included, and small-holders\r\nor tenants; these last working the land themselves, but not necessarily\r\nwithout employing hired or slave labour.\r\n\r\n\r\nX. ARISTOPHANES.\r\n\r\n=Aristophanes= is a witness of great importance. Of eleven surviving\r\nplays the _Acharnians_ appeared in 425 BC, the _Plutus_ in 388. Thus\r\nwe have from this prince of wit and humour a series of comments on the\r\nsocial and political life of Athens and Attica from the point of view\r\nof conservative admirers of good old times. The evidence of Comedy is\r\nliable to be suspect, on the ground of a tendency to exaggerate and\r\ndistort facts: but to make allowances for this tendency is not a task\r\nof extreme difficulty. Nor can it fairly be said that the political\r\nbias of the poet is such as to deprive his evidence of all authority.\r\nIf he seems at times to be singularly detached from the prejudices of\r\nthe war-party, dominating Athens under the democratic leaders, and able\r\nto discern and boldly to declare that the right was not solely on their\r\nown side in the war; still he was a warm patriot, devoted to the Athens\r\nwhose defects he could not ignore. Among the striking events of the time\r\nnothing seems to have impressed him more forcibly than the devastation\r\nof Attica and the consequent ruin of the agricultural interest. That the\r\ncooping-up of the rural population[153] within the walls month after\r\nmonth was a progressive calamity, could hardly escape the notice of\r\nany one then resident. It was not merely the squalor or the appalling\r\nsickness, though these were in themselves enough to produce a terrible\r\nstrain. Discontent and recklessness took hold of the masses, and other\r\nobservers beside Aristophanes remarked the degeneration of the democracy.\r\nAristophanes was an opponent of the war-policy, and strove hard to rally\r\nthe farmer-folk in favour of peace. He spared no pains to discredit\r\nthe noisy demagogues, accusing them of prolonging the war in order to\r\nretain or increase their own importance at the cost of the soundest\r\nelement in the civic body. But, while he turned the farmers’ grievances\r\nto account in political advocacy, he was no mere unscrupulous partisan.\r\nHis frequent references to the homely joys of country life, sometimes\r\nin sympathetic rural vignettes, have the ring of sincerity. Like many\r\nanother dweller in the unwholesome city, he sighed for the fresh air,\r\nthe wholesome food, the peace and quiet of Attic farmsteads: no doubt he\r\nidealized the surroundings, though he did not depict them as scenes of\r\nspotless innocence. But the details that drop out casually are often very\r\nsignificant from the point of view of my inquiry, and very helpful as\r\ngiving us a genuine picture of the time.\r\n\r\nOn no point is information more to be desired than the relation of\r\nagriculture to wealth. Is the typical farmer of the period a man of large\r\nestate or not? We have seen that the ‘old oligarch’ classed together\r\nthe wealthy and the farmers as favouring a peace-policy. That such a\r\nbody of opinion, large or small, existed in Athens, is also suggested by\r\npassages in Aristophanes. In the _Ecclesiazusae_, the play in which the\r\nleader of the female politicians offers to cure distress by a communistic\r\nscheme, we are told[154] that a proposal to mobilize a fleet divides the\r\nAssembly: the poor man votes for it, but the wealthy and the farmers are\r\nagainst it. I take it that, as in the case of the Sicilian expedition,\r\nthe man who wants to get paid for service (with a chance of profit)\r\nsupports the motion; those who dislike having to pay for the enterprise,\r\nor see no way of profiting by it, are in opposition. This is a phenomenon\r\nnormal in politics, and does not tell us whether the ‘farmers’ are\r\ncultivators on a large scale or small. Later in the play we find a\r\nprotest[155] against the iniquity of the present juxtaposition of wealth\r\nand destitution, the state of things in which one man farms much land\r\nwhile another has not enough to afford him a grave. Even a comic poet\r\nwould hardly put this into the mouth of one of his characters if there\r\nwere not some section of the audience to whom it might appeal. It is\r\nprobable that at the time (393-2 BC) communistic suggestions were among\r\nthe currents of opinion in humbled and impoverished Athens. To squeeze\r\nthe rich had long been the policy of the democrats, and a jealousy of\r\nwealth in any form became endemic in the distressful city. A few years\r\nlater (388 BC) the poet gave in the _Plutus_ a pointed discussion[156] of\r\neconomic questions, ridiculing the notion that all could be rich at the\r\nsame time: for nobody would work, and so civilization would come to an\r\nend. True, the individualistic bent of the average Athenian, grasping and\r\nlitigious, prevented the establishment of downright communism: but Athens\r\nwas henceforth never free from the jealous and hardly patriotic demands\r\nof the clamorous poor We must remember that military service, no longer\r\noffering prospects of profit in addition to pay, was becoming unpopular;\r\nthat land-allotments[157] in conquered territories had ceased; and that\r\nagriculture in a large part of Attica was toilsome and unremunerative.\r\nPoverty was widespread, and commerce declined: this implies that the\r\nsupply of slaves, and the money to buy them, would be reduced. Was there\r\nthen much to attract the poor man to the lonely tillage of a patch of\r\nrocky land? The generation of small farmers before and during the great\r\nwar had some outlook for themselves and their sons, serving in victorious\r\narmies or fleets, getting booty or allotments abroad. Hence they took a\r\nkeen interest in politics. The fall of Athens had changed all this: the\r\nprofits of empire had departed, and with them the buoyancy of an imperial\r\npride. No wonder if there were signs of unwillingness to follow a hard\r\nrustic life. So the Informer in the _Plutus_[158], when asked ‘are you\r\na husbandman?’ replies ‘do you take me for a madman?’ Earlier in the\r\nplay[159] Chremylus, wishing to share with old cronies the profits of\r\nhaving captured the god of wealth, says to his slave ‘invite my fellow\r\nfarmers: I fancy you’ll find them working themselves (αὐτοὺς) on their\r\nfarms.’\r\n\r\nI have taken this later picture first, in order to bring out more clearly\r\nthe contrast presented by that given in the earlier plays. Naturally\r\nenough, many details are the same in both, but the general character of\r\nthe farmers is different. The farmer class makes an important figure.\r\nThey are sturdy rustics[160], old-fashioned and independent, rough in\r\nmanners, fond of simple country life, and inclined (perhaps justly) to\r\nmistrust the city folk, who cheat them in business whenever they can,\r\nand take advantage of them in other ways, such as liability to military\r\nservice at short notice. When driven to take refuge in Athens, their\r\nhearts are in their farms, and they have to make up their minds whether\r\nto support the war-party in hope of regaining their homes and property\r\nby force of arms, or to press for peace in order to end what is from\r\ntheir point of view an unnecessary war, kept going in the interest of\r\ndemagogues and others who are profiting by the opportunities of offices\r\nand campaigns abroad. The issue appears in our earliest play, the\r\n_Acharnians_ (425 BC). The farmers of the deme Acharnae, one of whose\r\noccupations was wood-cutting and charcoal-burning, at first come on as\r\nstubborn rustics, all for war and revenge on the enemy. But Dicaeopolis\r\nthe chief character of the play, himself a farmer, and a sufferer in the\r\nsame kind by the Spartan raids, succeeds in persuading[161] them that\r\nAthenian policy, provocative and grasping, is really to blame for their\r\nlosses. In the end they come over to his views, and the play serves as a\r\nmanifesto of the peace-party. Of course we are not to take it as history.\r\nBut the conflict between the two sections of opinion is probably real\r\nenough. When Dicaeopolis describes[162] himself as ‘with my eyes ever\r\nturned to my farm, a lover of peace, detesting the city and hankering\r\nafter my own deme, that never yet bade me buy charcoal or rough wine or\r\nolive oil,’ he is giving us a portrait of the rustic who is resolved not\r\nto part with cash for what can be produced on the farm.\r\n\r\nBut, whatever policy may seem best adapted to achieve their purpose, the\r\npurpose itself is clearly and consistently marked. The desire of the\r\nwar-time farmers is simply to return to their farms[163] and to resume\r\nthe life of toil and plenty, varied by occasional festivals, that had\r\nbeen interrupted by the war. They long to escape from the abominations\r\nof the crowding and unhealthiness prevailing in the city. Once they get\r\nback to their old surroundings, all will be well. Time and labour will\r\neven repair the damages caused by the enemy. No misgivings suggest that\r\na change of circumstances may be found to have robbed Attic country\r\nlife of some of its charm. Nothing like the loss of the empire, the\r\nfall of Athens, and the deadly depression of economic and political\r\nlife, is foreboded: they face the sequel with undisturbed faith in the\r\nstability of the existing system. Nor indeed until the Sicilian disaster\r\n(413 BC) was there much to cause uneasiness. So we find the same spirit\r\nillustrated in the _Peace_ (421 BC), which may be regarded as driving\r\nhome the lesson of the _Acharnians_. The agricultural interests are now\r\nrepresented as solidly in favour of the peace of Nicias, unsatisfactory\r\nthough it soon proved to be. While other interests are slack, indifferent\r\nor even hostile, farmers are whole-hearted[164] in determination to\r\nend the war and go home. Trygaeus their leader, according to the Greek\r\nsketch of the plot an elderly rustic, describes himself[165] as a\r\n‘skilled vine-dresser, one who is no informer or fomenter of troubles\r\n(lawsuits).’ Needless to say, he carries his point, and the farmers march\r\noff triumphant[166] to their farms, eager to take up the old easygoing\r\nlife once more. We must not take our comic poet too literally, but we\r\nhave no reason to doubt that feelings such as he depicts in this play did\r\nprevail, and perhaps widely. And, though the peace was insincere, and\r\nwarfare never really ceased, the immunity of Attica from invasion for\r\nseveral years gave time for agriculture to revive. When Agis occupied\r\nDeceleia in the winter of 413, his marauders would find on the Attic\r\nfarms all manner of improvements and new plantations to destroy. And the\r\ndestruction of the fruits of a laborious revival is to be reckoned among\r\nthe depressing influences that weighed upon falling and desperate Athens.\r\nIt was surely at work in the year 411, when Aristophanes was preaching\r\na policy of concord at home and sympathetic treatment of the Allies in\r\norder to save the shaken empire. In the _Lysistrata_ he represents the\r\nmad war-fury of the Greek states as due to the misguided men, whom the\r\nwomen coerce by privation into willingness for peace. This is strung up\r\ninto a passionate longing, so that neither[167] of the principal parties\r\nis disposed to haggle over details. The Athenian breaks out ‘I want to\r\nstrip and work my land at once.’ The Spartan rejoins ‘and I want to be\r\ncarting manure.’ There is still no misgiving expressed, and the poet is\r\nprobably true to facts. The struggles of the time were a fearful strain\r\non Athenian resources, but it still seemed possible that the empire would\r\nweather the storm.\r\n\r\nThis brief sketch leads on to the inquiry, what do we gather as to the\r\nlabour employed on the farms? We have to consider three possibilities\r\n(_a_) the farmer, including his family, (_b_) hired labourers, (_c_)\r\nslaves. It is well to begin by remarking that frequency of reference to\r\none of these does not necessarily imply the same proportion in actual\r\nemployment. Slavery being assumed as a fact in all departments of life\r\n(as it is by all writers of the period), and the slave being an economic\r\nor domestic appliance rather than a person, there was no need to call\r\nspecial attention to his presence. Hence it is natural that the rustic\r\nslave should, as such, be seldom referred to in the plays. He is in fact\r\nmentioned several times, rather more often than the yoke of oxen. Nor was\r\nit necessary to mention the wage-earner, the man employed for the job\r\nunder a temporary contract, and in connexion with agriculture he hardly\r\nappears at all. But the working farmers were a class of citizens. They\r\nhad votes, and they were on political grounds a class to whose sympathies\r\nthe poet was anxious to appeal. Therefore he had no choice but to lay\r\nstress upon their virtues and magnify their importance. Any careful\r\nreader of Aristophanes will I think admit that he does this consistently.\r\nIn doing this with political aims he was subject to the temptation of\r\npassing lightly over any considerations that might, whether justly or\r\nunjustly, be turned against his case. This may serve to explain why he\r\nrefers almost solely to the small working farmer, who himself labours on\r\nthe land. We are not to infer that there were no large estates worked\r\nby deputy, though probably there were not many: to lay stress on the\r\ninterested views of large landowners was not likely to please the jealous\r\nDemos. Nor are we to infer that the small farmer used no slaves: that he\r\nlaboured himself is no proof, for no man could get more out of a slave’s\r\nlabour than the working owner, on whom the burden of making good his\r\nslave’s neglect must fall. I turn now to the passages from which the\r\nvarious details may be gleaned.\r\n\r\nIn the _Acharnians_ the working farmer Dicaeopolis is delighted at having\r\nmade a separate peace on his own account. He holds it a fine thing[168]\r\nthat he should now be able to perform religious rites and celebrate the\r\nfestival of the rustic Dionysia with his slaves. He is back at home[169]\r\nin his own rural deme, and he calls his slave Xanthias to carry the\r\nphallus in the procession. In the _Clouds_[170] old Strepsiades says that\r\nhe lives in the heart of the country, and his preference for the easy\r\nand rather squalid life on a farm is plainly expressed. And the play\r\nopens with his complaint that in war-time a man has not a free hand to\r\npunish his slaves. It is however not clear that he is supposed to be at\r\nthe time living on the farm. In the _Wasps_ the chorus of old dicasts\r\nare indignant[171] that their old comrade Philocleon should be dragged\r\noff by his own slaves at the order of his son. The old man himself,\r\nstruggling and protesting, reminds the leading slave of the time when\r\nhe caught the rogue stealing grapes (obviously in his vineyard) and\r\nthrashed him soundly. In the _Peace_ a rustic scene[172] is described.\r\nThe weather being unfavourable for work on the land, but excellent\r\nfor the seed just sown, it is proposed to make merry indoors. Country\r\nfare is made ready, and the female slave Syra is told to call in the\r\nman slave Manes from the farm. A little below Trygaeus is mocking the\r\nworkers in war-trades. To the trumpet-maker he says, fit up your trumpet\r\ndifferently[173] and you can turn it into a weighing-machine: ‘it will\r\nthen do for serving out rations of figs to your slaves on the farm.’ In\r\nthe _Lysistrata_ the chorus, being aware that an interval of distress\r\nwill follow the conclusion of peace, offers[174] to tide over the crisis\r\nby helping the fathers of large families and owners of hungry slaves\r\nby doles of food. ‘Let them bring their bags and wallets for wheat: my\r\nManes shall fill them.’ After these passages the announcement of the\r\nworking of the communistic scheme[175] in the _Ecclesiazusae_ carries us\r\ninto a very different atmosphere. ‘But who is to till the soil under the\r\nnew order?’ asks Blepyrus. ‘Our slaves,’ replies Praxagora, his typical\r\nbetter-half. We see that this amounts to basing society on a serf-system,\r\nfor the slaves will be common property like the rest. In the _Plutus_\r\nold Chremylus is a farmer, apparently a working[176] farmer, but he has\r\na slave, indeed more than one. Age has probably led him to do most of\r\nhis work by deputy. When Poverty, in the course of her economic lecture,\r\nexplains to him[177] that wealth for all means slaves for none and that\r\nhe will have to plough and dig for his own proper sustenance, he is\r\nindignant. The weak points of the argument do not concern us here. The\r\nsolution offered in the play, the cure of the Wealth-god’s blindness,\r\nenabling him to enrich only the deserving, is a mere piece of sportive\r\nnonsense, meant to amuse an audience, not to hold out a serious hope of\r\nbetter things.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to shew that the slave had a place in farm life\r\nas depicted by Aristophanes. It will be observed that in the earlier\r\nplays the references are all of a casual kind: that is to say, that\r\nslave-labour calls for no particular attention or remark. The\r\nconsideration of slave-labour as such, in fact as an economic phenomenon,\r\nonly appears later. This is, I repeat, significant of the change that\r\nhad come upon Athens and Attica in consequence of exhaustion. In respect\r\nof hired labour it is obvious that pressure of poverty, as stated[178]\r\nin the _Plutus_, directly influences the supply. If the possession\r\nof a competency will deter men from professional industry in trades,\r\neven more will it deter them from the drudgery of rough labour. The\r\nhired men (μισθωτοί) were commonly employed in all departments, for\r\ninstance in the building trades, to which there is a reference[179] in\r\nthe _Birds_. But we may fairly assume that during the great war the\r\nnumber of such ‘hands’ available for civilian services was much reduced.\r\nIn agriculture there would be little or no demand for them. And any\r\nable-bodied citizen could earn good pay from the state. Moreover rough\r\nlabour was not much to the taste of the average Athenian,—above all,\r\ndigging[180]. ‘I cannot dig’ was proverbial. On the other hand there were\r\nfarm-duties in the performance of which sufficient care and intelligence\r\ncould only be exacted through the medium of wage-paying. Such was that\r\nof olive-pickers, to whom and their wage we have a reference[181] in\r\nthe _Wasps_. They are probably free persons, but it is possible that\r\nwage-earning slaves, paying rent to their owners, might be thus employed.\r\nThat in some occupations free and slave-labour were both employed\r\nindifferently, is certain. The carriage of burdens[182] is a case in\r\npoint. But employment in odd jobs would be far more frequent in the city,\r\nincluding Peiraeus, than in country places. I do not think it rash to\r\nconclude that hired free labourers were few on the farms of Attica in the\r\ntime of Aristophanes.\r\n\r\nTurning to citizen agriculturists, it must be mentioned that views\r\ndiffer as to the proportion of large estates held and worked by wealthy\r\nowners in this period. Such estates would almost certainly employ\r\nslave-labour. So far as the evidence of Aristophanes goes, I should\r\ninfer that they were few. No doubt he had reasons for not making much of\r\nsuch cases; still I believe that the comfortable working farmer, homely\r\nand independent, the poet’s favourite character, was in fact the normal\r\ntype. They were not paupers,—far from it: but their capital consisted in\r\nland, buildings, dead and live farm-stock, and the unexhausted value of\r\nprevious cultivation. These items could not suddenly be converted into\r\nmoney without ruinous loss: most of them could not be carried away in the\r\nflight to Athens. Hence the dislike felt by such men to an adventurous\r\npolicy, in which their interests were sacrificed. The passages in\r\nwhich agriculture is connected[183] with large property occur in a play\r\nproduced 392 BC, at which time great changes had happened. It is highly\r\nprobable that, among these changes, much Attic land had passed from the\r\nhands of ruined yeomen into those of rich men possessed of ready money\r\nand able to buy in a glutted market. In a later period we shall find\r\nγεωργεῖν used in the sense of acting the country landowner. To illustrate\r\nthe life and ways of the peasant farmers of this period Aristophanes\r\nsupplies endless references descriptive and allusive. The chief of these\r\nhave been cited above. A few more may be added here. In the _Clouds_\r\nStrepsiades, urging his son to a rustic life, hopes to see him dressed in\r\na leathern jerkin, like his father before him, driving in the goats[184]\r\nfrom the waste (φελλέως, the rocky hill-pasture). Here is a good instance\r\nof husbandry in the Attic highlands, in short a case of crofters. What\r\na refugee might hope to save in his flight and take back to his farm on\r\nthe return of peace—it amounts to a few implements[185]—is set out in the\r\n_Peace_. Loss of oxen, a yoke of two, driven off by Boeotian raiders, is\r\npitifully bewailed[186] by a farmer in the _Acharnians_. But in general\r\nthe farmers of the earlier plays are represented as tough elderly men.\r\nThey are the ‘elder generation,’ and the poet genuinely admires them. For\r\nthe younger generation he has a profound contempt. Evidently he thought\r\nthat the soundest breed of Athenian citizens was dying out; and I am not\r\nsure that he was wrong.\r\n\r\nI conclude that the evidence of Aristophanes on the whole points to an\r\nagriculture mainly carried on by working farmers with the help of slaves.\r\nThis system was subjected to a very severe strain by the war-conditions\r\nprevailing for many years, and I do not think that it was possible to\r\nrevive it on the same footing as before, even when Attica was no longer\r\nexposed to frequent raids. It was not merely the loss of fixed capital\r\nthat told on the farmer class. Importation of corn was so developed\r\nand organized to meet the necessities of the crowded city, that it\r\ncompletely dominated the market, and in the production of cereals the\r\nhome agriculture could now no longer compete with foreign harvests.\r\nThere remained the culture of the olive and vine: but it needed years\r\nto restore plantations of these and other fruit-trees, and to wait for\r\nrevival needed a capital possessed by few. The loss of imperial revenues\r\nimpoverished Athens, and the struggle with financial difficulties runs\r\nthrough all her later history. It did not take the poorer citizens long\r\nto see that how to get daily bread was the coming problem. State-pay was\r\nno longer plentiful, and one aim of jealous franchise-regulations was\r\nto keep down the number of claimants. Had Aristophanes any inkling of\r\nthe evil days to come? At all events he was aware that poverty works in\r\ntwo[187] ways: if it leads one man to practise a trade for his living, it\r\ntempts another to evildoing, perhaps to crime.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. THUCYDIDES.\r\n\r\n=Thucydides= is a writer from whom it is extremely difficult to extract\r\nany evidence on the subject of agricultural labour. The preeminent\r\nimportance of the problem of food-supply in the Greece of his day may be\r\namply illustrated from his work; but mainly in casual utterances, the\r\nfull significance of which is only to be gathered by thorough examination\r\nsuch as has been made[188] by Dr Grundy. The economic revolution in\r\nAttica that followed the reforms of Solon, the extended culture of the\r\nvine and olive, the reduced growth of cereal crops, the development of\r\nmanufactures and sea-borne trade, the growing dependence on imported\r\ncorn, and the influence of these changes on the public policy of Athens,\r\nare now seen more clearly as a whole than ever before. But to the great\r\nhistorian these things were part of the background of his picture.\r\nThey are parts of a movement taken for granted rather than understood.\r\nAnd the same is true of the existence and application of slave-labour.\r\nIn the time of Thucydides slavery was an economic and social fact,\r\nunchallenged. It may be that it affected unfavourably the position of the\r\nfree handworker in the long run, and gave opportunities to slaveowning\r\ncapitalists. But this effect came about slowly, and freeman and slave\r\ncould and did labour[189] side by side, for instance in the great public\r\nworks promoted by Pericles. How far slave-labour was really cheaper\r\nthan free is a question beyond my subject. But it is important to note\r\nthe attitude of the poor citizen towards the question of what we call\r\na living wage. Once the great outlay on public works began to fall\r\noff, and industries on a larger scale to compete with the individual\r\ncraftsman, how was the poor citizen to live? Directly or indirectly, the\r\nprofits of empire supplied the answer. Now it was obvious that the fewer\r\nthe beneficiaries the larger would be the average dividend of each. So\r\nthe policy favoured by the poorer classes was a jealous restriction of\r\nthe franchise. It was not the slave as labour-competitor against whom\r\nprotection was desired, but the resident freeman of doubtful origin as a\r\npotential profit-sharer.\r\n\r\nDuring nearly the whole of the period covered by the history of\r\nThucydides the public policy of Athens was controlled by urban\r\ninfluences. Even before the rustic citizens were cooped up in the city,\r\nit was no doubt city residents that formed the normal majority in the\r\nAssembly, and to whom most of the paid offices and functions fell.\r\nEven allowing for the recent growth of ‘seafaring rabble’ in Peiraeus,\r\nthese Athenians were not at all a mere necessitous mob. But it must\r\nbe remembered that the commercial and industrial capitalists were\r\ninterested in foreign trade. As Mr Cornford[190] points out, even metics\r\nof this class must have had considerable influence owing to wealth and\r\nconnexions. Thus the urban rich as well as the urban poor were tempted\r\nto favour a policy of adventure, contrary to the wishes and interests of\r\nthe Attic farmers. Now these latter were the truest representatives of\r\nthe old Attic stock. Once they were crowded into the city and many of\r\nthem diverted to state service, any sobering influence that they might\r\nat first exercise would become less and less marked, and they would tend\r\nto be lost in the mass. Therefore we hear only of the rustic life[191]\r\nfrom which they unwillingly tore themselves in 431 BC: we do not get\r\nany detailed picture of it, for the historian’s attention was otherwise\r\noccupied. In the passage[192] accounting for the unpopularity of Pericles\r\nin 430 BC we read that the Demos was irritated because ‘having less (than\r\nthe rich) to start with, it had been deprived of that little,’ while\r\nthe upper class (δυνατοὶ) had lost their fine establishments. Here the\r\ncontext seems to imply that the δῆμος referred to is especially the small\r\nfarmers, still dwelling on their losses and not yet otherwise employed.\r\n\r\nOne passage is so important that it must be discussed by itself. Pericles\r\nis made to encourage[193] the Athenians in resistance to the Spartan\r\ndemands by pointing out the superiority of their resources compared with\r\nthose of the enemy. ‘The Peloponnesians’ he says ‘are working farmers\r\n(αὐτουργοί). They have no store of wealth (χρήματα) either private or\r\npublic. Nor have they experience of protracted warfare with operations\r\nbeyond the sea: for their own campaigns against each other are short,\r\nowing to poverty.’ After explaining how they must be hampered by lack\r\nof means, he resumes thus ‘And working farmers are more ready to do\r\nservice in person than by payment. They trust that they may have the\r\nluck to survive the perils of war; but they have no assurance that their\r\nmeans will not be exhausted before it ends: for it may drag out to an\r\nunexpected length—and this is likely to happen.’ Two questions at once\r\nsuggest themselves. Is this a fair sketch of agricultural conditions in\r\nPeloponnese? Does it imply that Attic farmers were not αὐτουργοί? To take\r\nthe latter first, it is held by Professor Beloch[194] that the passage\r\ncharacterizes the Peloponnese as a land of free labour, in contrast with\r\nslave-holding Athens. To this view I cannot assent. I am convinced that\r\nthe Attic farmer who worked with his own hands did often, if not always,\r\nemploy slave-labour also. He would not have a large gang of slaves, like\r\nthe large-scale cultivator: he could not afford to keep an overseer.\r\nBut it might pay him to keep one or two slaves, not more than he could\r\noversee himself. If the contrast be clearly limited, so as to compare\r\nthe wealth of Athens, now largely industrial and commercial, with the\r\nwealth of a purely agricultural population, scattered over a wide area,\r\nand having little ready money, it is reasonable and true. But this does\r\nnot raise the question of the Attic farmer at all. A little below[195]\r\nPericles is made to urge that class to submit quietly to invasion and\r\nserious loss. They are not the people on whose resources he relies to\r\nwear out the enemy. That enemy finds it hard to combine for common\r\naction or to raise money by war-taxes. Athens is a compact community,\r\nable to act quickly, and has at disposal the forces and tribute of her\r\nsubjects, secured by naval supremacy. To the other question, that of\r\nPeloponnesian agriculture, I see no simple answer. All the southern\r\nparts, the region of Spartan helotry, can hardly be called a land of\r\nfree labour in any rational sense. Nor does it appear that Argolis, in\r\nspite of the various revolutions in local politics, could rightly be\r\ndescribed thus. Elis and Achaia were hardly of sufficient importance\r\nto justify such a general description, even if it were certain that it\r\nwould apply to them locally. Arcadia, mostly mountainous and backward,\r\nis the district to which the description would be most applicable. But\r\nthat there were slaves in Arcadia is not only probable but attested by\r\nevidence, later in date but referring to an established[196] state of\r\nthings. At festivals, we are told, slaves and masters shared the same\r\ntable. This does not exclude rustic slaves: it rather seems to suggest\r\nthem. The working farmer entertaining his slaves on a rural holiday is\r\neven a conventional tradition of ancient country life. Arcadia, a land of\r\npeasant farmers, where a living had to be won by hard work, a land whence\r\nalready in the fifth century (and still more in the fourth) came numbers\r\nof mercenary soldiers, a land whence Sparta raised no small part of her\r\n‘Peloponnesian’ armies, is what Pericles has chiefly in mind. And that\r\nArcadians were normally αὐτουργοὶ did not imply that they had no slaves.\r\n\r\nSo far as Attica is concerned, Thucydides himself incidentally attests\r\nthe presence of rustic slaves. He would probably have been, surprised to\r\nhear such an obvious fact questioned. In refusing to repeal the ‘Megarian\r\ndecree’ the Athenians charged[197] the Megarians with various offences,\r\none of which was the reception of their runaway slaves. In the winter\r\n415-4 BC Alcibiades, urging the Spartans to occupy Deceleia, is made to\r\nstate[198] the advantages of that move thus ‘For of all the farm-stock\r\nin the country the bulk will at once come into your possession, some by\r\ncapture, and the rest of its own accord (αὐτόματα).’ I take the last\r\nwords to refer especially to slaves,—rustic slaves. In recording the\r\nsuccess of the plan, the historian tells[199] us that more than 20000\r\nslaves, a large part of whom were artisans (χειροτέχναι), deserted to the\r\nenemy. We may guess that many or most of the artisan slaves had escaped\r\nfrom Athens. Their loss would be felt in the reduction of manufacturing\r\noutput, so far as such enterprise was still possible at the time, and\r\nperhaps in the dockyards. But the rest would be rustic slaves, many of\r\nthem (to judge by the map) from a district[200] in which there were\r\nprobably many small farms. On the other hand, the slaves welcomed by\r\nthe Megarians were probably from larger estates in the Thriasian plain.\r\nTurning from Attica, we find references to rustic slaves[201] in Corcyra\r\n(427 BC) and Chios (412 BC), where they were numerous and important\r\nin their effect on operations. And in other passages where the slaves\r\nbelonging to the people of this or that place are mentioned we are not\r\nto assume that only urban slaves are meant. For to live in a town, and\r\ngo out for the day’s work on the land, was and is a common usage in\r\nMediterranean countries. An extreme case[202] is where people live on an\r\nisland and cross water to cultivate farms elsewhere. It is perhaps hardly\r\nnecessary to remark that rich slaveowners, who could afford overseers,\r\ndid not need to reside permanently on their estates. Such a man might\r\nhave more than one farm, and in more than one district, not necessarily\r\nin Attica at all, as Thucydides himself exploited a mining concession in\r\nThrace. In any case a well-equipped ‘country place’ was a luxury, and\r\nis characterized as such[203] in words put into the mouth of Pericles,\r\nwho as the democratic statesman was concerned to stifle discontent by\r\ninsinuating that it was a mere expression of the selfishness of the rich.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of Athenians in colonies (ἀποικίαι) or on allotments\r\nof conquered land (κληρουχίαι), in the islands or on the seaboard has\r\nbeen fully treated[204] by Dr Grundy. He shews that this movement had\r\ntwo aims, the occupation of strategic points as an imperial measure\r\nof security, and the provision of land-lots for poorer citizens as a\r\nmeasure of economic relief. The latter purpose is part of a general plan\r\nfor reducing the financial liabilities of the state with respect to its\r\ncitizen population, the necessity for which Dr Grundy explains. By these\r\nsettlements abroad some surplus population was removed and provided with\r\nmeans of livelihood. If the assumption of a surplus citizen population\r\nbe sound (and I am not in a position to challenge it), we must also\r\nassume a certain degree of genuine land-hunger, at least more than the\r\nAttic territory could satisfy. If there was such land-hunger, it is\r\nperhaps not unreasonable to connect it with the survival of old Attic\r\ntraditions of country life. And it would seem that the settlers, cleruchs\r\nor colonists, did as a rule[205] stay and live in their settlements.\r\nThey would probably work their lands on much the same general plan as\r\ntheir brethren in Attica, and their labour-arrangements would be much\r\nthe same. But in 427 BC, when Pericles was dead and there was surely no\r\nsurplus population, at least of able-bodied men, owing to the war, we\r\nfind a curious record. Reconquered Lesbos[206] had to be dealt with. It\r\nwas not subjected to an assessed tribute (φόρος), but parcelled into\r\n3000 allotments, 2700 of which were reserved for 2700 Athenian citizens,\r\nthose who drew the lucky lots (τοὺς λαχόντας), and these 2700 were sent\r\nout. But they did not stay[207] there. They let their shares to the old\r\ninhabitants as cultivating tenants, at a rent of two minae per share\r\nper annum, and evidently returned to Athens. By this arrangement a sum\r\nof about £21000 a year would come in to the shareholders in Athens,\r\nwho would have a personal interest in seeing that it was punctually\r\npaid. Whether these non-resident landlords were chosen by lot from all\r\ncitizens, rich or poor, is not stated. We know that in some cases[208]\r\nat least the choice of settlers was confined to members of the two\r\nlowest property-classes; and it may well be that on this occasion the\r\nopportunity[209] was taken to compensate to some extent members of rural\r\nfamilies, who had suffered loss from the invasions of Attica, but did not\r\nwish to go abroad. In any case their tenants would farm as they had done\r\nbefore, employing or not employing slave labour according to their means\r\nand the circumstances of the several farms. So too in cases of lands let\r\non lease, and in the confiscations and redistributions of lands, proposed\r\nor carried out, it was simply their own profit and comfort that attracted\r\nthe lessees or beneficiaries. We are entitled to assume that if it paid\r\nto employ slaves, and slaves were to be had, then slaves were employed.\r\nIn short, the scraps of evidence furnished by Thucydides leave us pretty\r\nmuch where we were.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII. XENOPHON.\r\n\r\n=Xenophon=, who lived somewhere between 440 and 350 BC, introduces us\r\nto a great change in the conditions of the Greek world. The uneasiness\r\nand sufferings of the Greek states from the fall of Athens in 404 to the\r\ntime of exhaustion resulting from the battle of Mantinea in 362 do not\r\nconcern us here. Of such matters we hear much, but very little directly\r\nof the economic changes that were undoubtedly going on. Poverty was as\r\nbefore a standing trouble in Greece. In the more backward parts[210]\r\nable-bodied men left their homes to serve as hired soldiers. The age of\r\nprofessional mercenaries was in full swing. Arcadians Achaeans Aetolians\r\nAcarnanians Thessalians and other seekers after fortune became more\r\nand more the staple material of armies. Athens could no longer support\r\nimperial ambitions on imperial tributes, and had to depend on the sale\r\nof her products to procure her supplies of food. These products were\r\nchiefly oil and wine and urban manufactures, and there is reason to think\r\nthat in general the most economical method of production was by slave\r\nlabour under close and skilful superintendence. Slaves were supplied\r\nby kidnappers from the Euxine and elsewhere, but prisoners captured\r\nby armies were another source of supply. This living loot was one of\r\nthe perquisites that made military life attractive, and the captives\r\nfound their way to such markets as the industrial centres of Athens and\r\nCorinth. What happened in the rural districts of Attica, how far there\r\nwas a revival of the small farmer class, is a point on which we are very\r\nmuch in the dark. The indirect evidence of Xenophon is interesting but\r\nnot wholly conclusive.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps important to consider what significance should be attached\r\nto the mention of agricultural work done by men of military forces on\r\nland or sea. In 406 BC we hear of hardships[211] endured by the force\r\nunder the Spartan Eteonicus who were cut off in Chios after the defeat\r\nof Arginusae. During the summer months they ‘supported themselves on\r\nthe fruits of the season and by working for hire in the country.’ This\r\nis meant to shew that they were in sad straits, as the sequel clearly\r\nproves. Again, in 372 BC Iphicrates was with a force in Corcyra, and\r\nnaval operations were for the time over. So he ‘managed[212] to provide\r\nfor his oarsmen (νάυτας) chiefly by employing them in farm-work for the\r\nCorcyraeans,’ while he undertook an expedition on the mainland with his\r\nsoldiers. In both these cases want of pay was no doubt one reason for\r\nemergency-labour. In the earlier case the destitution of the men led\r\nthem to look for any paid work: in the second the general had to do his\r\nbest in spite of irregular and insufficient supplies from home. In both\r\ncases it is the exceptional nature of the arrangement that makes it worth\r\nmentioning. It can hardly be viewed as having any economic significance.\r\nBut it is of some interest in connexion with a passage of Aristotle[213]\r\nthat will require notice below.\r\n\r\nIn the _Anabasis_ Xenophon reports his own arguments, urging the Greek\r\narmy to fight their way out of the Persian empire. He feared that,\r\nnow Cyrus was dead, and they were cut off far from home in an enemy’s\r\ncountry, they might in despair surrender to the King and take service\r\nunder him. At best this meant giving up Greece and settling in Persia on\r\nthe King’s terms. This he begged them not to do: that they could under\r\nGreek discipline cut their way out was evident from the independence\r\nof many peoples of Asia Minor, who lived and raided as they chose in\r\ndefiance of the Persian power. He added ‘Therefore I hold[214] that our\r\nright and proper course is first to make a push to reach Hellas and our\r\nown kinsmen, and to demonstrate to the Greeks that their poverty is\r\ntheir own fault: for, if they would only convey to these parts those of\r\ntheir citizens who are now living in want at home, they could see them\r\nin plenty (πλουσίους).’ But he reminds them that the good things of Asia\r\nare only to be had as the reward of victory. For my present purpose\r\nthe one important point is that a mixed host of Greek mercenaries are\r\nsaid to have been appealed to by a reference to the fact of poverty and\r\nland-hunger among their folks at home, and that this reference is said\r\nto have been made by an Athenian. Writing this in later life, Xenophon\r\nwould hardly have set down such an argument had it not then, as on the\r\noccasion recorded, had considerable force. In another passage[215] he\r\ngives an interesting account of the motives that had induced most of the\r\nmen to join the expedition. He is explaining why they were irritated at\r\na rumour that they were to be pressed to settle down at a spot on the\r\nEuxine coast. ‘It was not lack of subsistence that had led most of the\r\nsoldiers to go abroad on this paid service: they had been told of the\r\ngenerosity of Cyrus. Some had other men following them, some had even\r\nspent money for the cause: others had run away from their parents, or\r\nleft children behind, meaning to win money and return to them, on the\r\nfaith of the reported prosperity of those already in the service of\r\nCyrus. Such was the character of the men, and they were longing to get\r\nsafe home to Greece.’ In short, full-blooded men were not content to\r\ndrag on poor ill-found stagnant lives in corners of Greece. And we may\r\nadd that nothing stimulated the enterprises of Greek adventurers in the\r\nEast, and led up to the conquests of Alexander, more effectually than the\r\nexperiences of the Ten Thousand.\r\n\r\nAmong these experiences was of course the capture of booty, more\r\nparticularly[216] in the form of marketable prisoners. So many of these\r\nwere sometimes in hand that they were a drag on the march: in a moment\r\nof peril[217] they had to be abandoned. Even so, a considerable sum had\r\nbeen raised by sales[218] and was shared out at Cerasus. The Greek cities\r\non the Pontic seaboard would all no doubt be resorts of slave-dealers.\r\nOne of the Ten Thousand himself, formerly a slave[219] at Athens,\r\nrecognized as kinsmen by their speech the people of a mountain tribe in\r\nArmenia. In Thrace too we hear of the chieftain Seuthes, when short of\r\ncash, offering[220] to make a payment partly in slaves. Nor was selling\r\ninto slavery a fate reserved for barbarians alone. Greeks[221] had been\r\ntreated thus in the great war lately ended; and now the Spartan harmost,\r\nanxious to clear the remainder of the Ten Thousand[222] out of Byzantium\r\nsafely, made them an offer of facilities for a raid in Thrace: any that\r\nstayed behind in the town were to be sold as slaves. And more than 400\r\nwere accordingly sold. It seems reasonable to infer that at this time the\r\nslave-markets were as busy as ever, perhaps more so than had been the\r\ncase during the great war. It may be going too far to say that in some\r\nparts of Greece people were now trying to restore a broken prosperity by\r\nindustrial exploitation of slave-labour, while from other parts soldiers\r\nof fortune and kidnappers went forth to enlarge the supply of slaves.\r\nBut that there is some truth in such a statement I do not doubt. It was\r\nevidently no easy matter for persons of small means to live in any sort\r\nof comfort at Athens. We hear of Socrates[223] discussing with a friend\r\nthe embarrassments of a genteel household. The late civil disorders have\r\ndriven a number of this man’s sisters cousins and aunts to take refuge in\r\nhis house. In the present state of things neither land nor house property\r\nare bringing in anything, and nobody will lend. How is he to maintain\r\na party of 14 free persons in all? Socrates points to the case of a\r\nneighbour who provides for a still larger household without difficulty.\r\nQuestions elicit the fact that this household consists of slave-artisans\r\ntrained to useful trades. The distressed party have been brought up as\r\nladies, to do nothing. Socrates suggests that they had better work for\r\nbread than starve. The adoption of this suggestion produced the happiest\r\nresults in every way. Such was the way in which Socrates led his friend.\r\nHe drew from him the assertion that free people are superior to slaves,\r\nand so brought him round to the conviction that superiority could not be\r\nshewn by mere incapacity for work.\r\n\r\nIn this conversation of Socrates may be detected the germ of a complete\r\nrevolution in thought on labour-subjects. It avoids the topic of\r\ncommon humanity. That the slave is a man and brother, only the victim\r\nof misfortune, had been hinted by Euripides and was to become a theme\r\nof comic poets. But Socrates lets this point alone, and argues from\r\nnatural economic necessity. Elsewhere he denounces[224] idleness and\r\nproclaims that useful labour is good for the labourer, taking a moral\r\npoint of view. Again, he suggests[225] that the shortcomings of slaves\r\nare largely due to their masters’ slackness or mismanagement. But he\r\naccepts slavery as a social and economic fact. All the same he makes\r\nplay at times with the notion of moral worthlessness, which many people\r\nregarded as characteristic of slaves in general. It is the knowledge of\r\nthe true qualities[226] of conduct, in short of the moral and political\r\nvirtues, that makes men honourable gentlemen (καλοὺς κἀγαθούς), and the\r\nlack of this knowledge that makes them slavish (ἀνδραποδώδεις). But, if\r\nthe difference between a liberal and an illiberal training, expressed\r\nin resulting habits of mind, is thus great, the slavish must surely\r\ninclude many of those legally free. Hence he even goes so far as to\r\nsay ‘Therefore we ought to spare no exertions to escape being slaves\r\n(ἀνδράποδα).’ And he lays stress on the need of moral qualities[227]\r\nin slaves as well as freemen: we should never be willing to entrust\r\nour cattle or our store-houses or the direction of our works to a\r\nslave devoid of self-control. His position suggests two things: first,\r\nthat the importance of the slave in the economic and social system was\r\na striking fact now recognized: second, that the unavoidable moral\r\ndegradation generally assumed to accompany the condition of slavery\r\nwas either wrongfully assumed or largely due to the shortcomings of\r\nmasters. The conception of the slave as a mere chattel, injury to which\r\nis simply a damage to its owner, was proving defective in practice,\r\nand the philosopher was inclined to doubt its soundness in principle.\r\nXenophon had been brought into touch with such questionings by his\r\nintercourse with Socrates. It remains to see how far he shews traces of\r\ntheir influence when he comes to treat labour-problems in connexion with\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nReferences to agriculture[228] are few and unimportant in the\r\n_Memorabilia_. The _Economicus_ deals directly with the subject. A\r\nsignificant passage throws light on the condition of rural Attica at\r\nthe end of the fifth century BC. The speaker Ischomachus tells[229]\r\nhow his father made money by judicious enterprise. He bought up farms\r\nthat were let down or derelict, got them into good order, and sold\r\nthem at a profit when improved. Clearly he was a citizen, able to deal\r\nin real estate, and a capitalist. There can hardly be a doubt that\r\nhe operated by the use of slave-labour on a considerable scale. All\r\nthrough the _Economicus_ slavery is presupposed, but the attitude of\r\nXenophon is characteristically genial and humane. The existence of a\r\nslave-market[230], where you may buy likely men, even skilled craftsmen,\r\nis assumed. But the most notable feature of the book is the seriousness\r\nwith which the responsibility of the master[231] is asserted. There is\r\nno querulous evasion of the issue by laying the blame of failure on the\r\nincorrigible vices of slaves. Prosperity will depend on securing good\r\nservice: good service cannot be secured by any amount of chains and\r\npunishments, if the master be slack and fitful: both in the house and\r\non the farm, good sympathetic discipline, fairly and steadily enforced,\r\nis the secret of success. Carelessness malingering and desertion must\r\nbe prevented or checked. And to achieve this is the function of the\r\neconomic art, operating through the influence of hope rather than\r\nfear. The training of slaves[232] is a matter needing infinite pains\r\non the part of the master and mistress. She must train her housekeeper\r\n(ταμία) as he trains his steward (ἐπίτροπος), and both are to act in a\r\nhumane and kindly spirit. Yet the strictly animal view of slaves[233]\r\nappears clearly in a passage where the training of slaves is compared\r\nwith that of horses or performing dogs. ‘But it is possible to make\r\nmen more obedient by mere instruction (καὶ λόγῳ), pointing out that it\r\nis to their interest to obey: in dealing with slaves the system which\r\nis thought suitable for training beasts has much to recommend it as a\r\nway of teaching obedience. For by meeting their appetites with special\r\nindulgence to their bellies you may contrive to get much out of them.’\r\nWe gather that the better and more refined type of Athenian gentleman\r\nwith a landed estate, while averse to inhumanity, and aware that slaves\r\nwere human, still regarded his slaves as mere chattels. His humanity is\r\nprompted mainly by self-interest. As for rights, they have none.\r\n\r\nThe system of rewards and punishments on the estate of course rests\r\nwholly on the masters will. The whole success of the working depends on\r\nthe efficiency of the steward or stewards. Accordingly the passage in\r\nwhich Ischomachus explains how he deals with these trusted slaves is\r\nof particular interest. Having carefully trained a man, he must judge\r\nhim[234] according to a definite standard—does he or does he not honestly\r\nand zealously discharge his trust? ‘When I find that in spite of good\r\ntreatment they still try to cheat me, I conclude that their greediness\r\nis past curing, and degrade them[235] from their charge.’ This seems to\r\nmean that they are reduced to the position of the ordinary hands. ‘But\r\nwhen I observe any induced to be honest[236] not merely because honesty\r\npays best, but because they want to get a word of praise from me, these I\r\ntreat as no longer slaves (ὥσπερ ἐλευθέροις ἤδη). I not only enrich them,\r\nbut shew them respect as men of honour.’ One is tempted to interpret\r\nthese last words as implying that actual manumission takes place, the\r\nservices of the men being retained as freedmen. But the words do not say\r\nso plainly, and it is safer to read into them no technical sense. That\r\nthe men are trusted and allowed to earn for themselves, is enough. The\r\nagriculture depicted in the _Economicus_ is that of a landowner with\r\nplenty of capital, not that of the peasant farmer. The note of it is\r\nsuperintendence[237] (ἐπιμέλεια), not bodily labour (αὐτουργία). In one\r\nplace αὐτουργία is mentioned, when agriculture is praised, one of its\r\nmerits being the bodily strength that those gain who work with their own\r\nhands. It is as well to repeat here that the fact of a farmer labouring\r\nhimself does not prove that he employs no other labour. On the other\r\nhand there is good reason to infer that the other class, those who ‘do\r\ntheir farming by superintendence,’ are not manual labourers at all. The\r\nbenefit to them is that agriculture ‘makes them early risers and smart in\r\ntheir movements.’ The master keeps a horse, and is thus enabled to ride\r\nout[238] early to the farm and stay there till late.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that in this book we hear nothing of hired labourers.\r\nThere are two references[239] to the earning of pay, neither of them in\r\nconnexion with agricultural labour. Yet the existence of a class of poor\r\npeople who have to earn their daily bread[240] is not ignored. Socrates\r\nadmires the economic skill[241] of Ischomachus. It has enabled him to be\r\nof service to his friends and to the state. This is a fine thing, and\r\nshews the man of substance. In contrast, ‘there are numbers of men who\r\ncannot live without depending on others: numbers too who are content\r\nif they can procure themselves the necessaries of life.’ The solid\r\nand strong men are those who contrive to make a surplus and use it as\r\nbenefactors. I read this passage as indirect evidence of the depression\r\nof small-scale free industry and the increase of slaveowning capitalism\r\nin the Athens of Xenophon’s time. And I find another indication[242]\r\nof this in connexion with agriculture. In the course of the dialogue\r\nit appears that the chief points of agricultural knowledge are simple\r\nenough: Socrates knew them all along. Why then do some farmers succeed\r\nand others fail? The truth of the matter is, replies Ischomachus, that\r\nthe cause of failure is not want of knowledge but want of careful\r\nsuperintendence. This criticism is in general terms, but it is surely\r\ninapplicable to the case of the working peasant farmer: he who puts\r\nhis own labour into the land will not overlook the shortcomings of a\r\nhired man or a slave. In the agriculture of which this book treats it\r\nis the practical and intelligent self-interest of the master that rules\r\neverything. His appearance on the field[243] should cause all the slaves\r\nto brighten up and work with a will: but rather to win his favour than to\r\nescape his wrath. For in agriculture, as in other pursuits, the ultimate\r\nsecret of success[244] is a divine gift, the power of inspiring a willing\r\nobedience.\r\n\r\nI have kept back one passage which needs to be considered with reference\r\nto the steward[245]. Can we safely assume that an ἐπίτροπος was always,\r\nor at least normally, a slave? Of those who direct the labourers, the\r\nreal treasure is the man who gets zealous and steady work out of the\r\nhands, whether he be steward or director (ἐπίτροπος or ἐπιστάτης).\r\nWhat difference is connoted by these terms? In the _Memorabilia_[246],\r\nSocrates meets an old friend who is impoverished by the results of the\r\ngreat war, and driven to earn his living by bodily labour. Socrates\r\npoints out to him that this resource will fail with advancing age: he had\r\nbetter find some employment less dependent on bodily vigour. ‘Why not\r\nlook out for some wealthy man who needs an assistant in superintendence\r\nof his property? Such a man would find it worth his while to employ you\r\nas director (or foreman, ἔργων ἐπιστατοῦντα), to help in getting in his\r\ncrops and looking after his estate.’ He answers ‘it would gall me to put\r\nup with a servile position (δουλείαν).’ Clearly the position of ἐπιστάτης\r\nappears to him a meaner occupation than free wage-earning by manual\r\nlabour. In another place[247] we hear of an ἐπιστάτης for a mine-gang\r\nbeing bought for a talent (£235). That superintendents, whatever their\r\ntitle, were at least normally slaves, seems certain. As to the difference\r\nbetween ‘steward’ and ‘director’ I can only guess that the former might\r\nbe a slave promoted from the ranks, but might also be what the ‘director’\r\nalways was, a new importation. It seems a fair assumption that, as a\r\nfree superintendent must have been a new importation, a specially bought\r\nslave ‘director’ would rank somewhat higher than an ordinary ‘steward,’\r\nwhose title ἐπίτροπος at once marked him as a slave. In relation to the\r\ngeneral employment of slave-labour there is practically no difference:\r\nboth are slave-driving ‘overseers.’ As the pamphlet on the Revenues has\r\nbeen thought by some critics not to be the work of Xenophon, I pass\r\nit by, only noting that it surely belongs to the same generation. It\r\nfully attests the tendency to rely[248] on slave-labour, but it is not\r\nconcerned with agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe romance known as _Cyropaedia_ wanders far from fact. Its purpose is\r\nto expound or suggest Xenophon’s own views on the government of men:\r\naccordingly opportunities for drawing a moral are sought at the expense\r\nof historical truth. But from my present point of view the chief point\r\nto note is that it does not touch the labour-question with which we\r\nare concerned. True, we hear[249] of αὐτουργοί, and of the hardship\r\nand poverty of such cultivators, gaining a painful livelihood from an\r\nunkind soil. That the value of a territory depends on the presence of\r\na population[250] able and willing to develop its resources, is fully\r\ninsisted on by Cyrus. But this is in connexion with conquest. The\r\ninhabitants of a conquered district remain as tributary cultivators,\r\nmerely changing their rulers. That the labour of the conquered is\r\nto provide the sustenance of the conquering race, is accepted as a\r\nfundamental principle. It is simply the right of the stronger: if he\r\nleaves anything to his subject, that is a voluntary act of grace. The\r\nreason why we hear little of slavery is that all are virtually slaves\r\nsave the one autocrat. The fabric of Xenophon’s model government is\r\na very simple one: first, an oriental Great King, possessed of all\r\nthe virtues: second, a class of warrior nobles, specially trained and\r\ndependent on the King’s favour: third, a numerous subject population,\r\nwhose labour supports the whole, and who are practically serfs. A cynical\r\npassage[251] describes the policy of Cyrus, meant to perpetuate the\r\ndifference of the classes. After detailing minutely the liberal training\r\nenjoined on those whom he intended to employ in governing (οὓς ... ἄρχειν\r\nᾤετο χρῆναι), Xenophon proceeds to those whom he intended to qualify\r\nfor servitude (οὓς ... κατεσκεύαζεν εἰς τὸ δουλεύειν). These it was his\r\npractice not to urge to any of the liberal exercises, nor to allow them\r\nto possess arms. He took great care to spare them any privations: for\r\ninstance at a hunt: the hunters had to take their chance of hunger and\r\nthirst, being freemen, but the beaters had ample supplies and halted\r\nfor meals. They were delighted with this consideration, the design of\r\nwhich was to prevent their ever ceasing to be slaves (ἀνδράποδα). The\r\nwhole scheme is frankly imperial. All initiative and power rests with\r\nthe autocrat, and all depends on his virtues. That a succession of\r\nsuch faultless despots could not be ensured, and that the scheme was\r\nconsequently utopian, did not trouble the simple Xenophon. Like many\r\nother thoughtful men of the time, he was impressed by the apparent\r\nefficiency of the rigid Spartan system, and distrusted the individual\r\nliberty enjoyed in democratic states, above all in Athens. In Persia,\r\nthough he thought the Persians were no longer what Cyrus the Great had\r\nmade them, he had seen how great was still the power arising from the\r\ncontrol of all resources by a single will. These two impressions combined\r\nseem to account for the tone of the _Cyropaedia_, and the servile\r\nposition of the cultivators explains why it has so very little bearing on\r\nthe labour-question in agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII. THE COMIC FRAGMENTS.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing our subject from period to period, and keeping so far as\r\npossible to chronological order, it may seem inconsistent to take this\r\ncollection[252] of scraps as a group. For Attic Comedy covers nearly\r\ntwo centuries, from the age of Cratinus to the age of Menander. Many\r\nchanges happened in this time, and the evidence of the fragments must not\r\nbe cited as though it were that of a single witness. But the relevant\r\npassages are few; for the writers, such as Athenaeus and Stobaeus,\r\nin whose works most of the extracts are preserved, seldom had their\r\nattention fixed on agriculture. The longer fragments[253] of Menander\r\nrecently discovered are somewhat more helpful. The adaptations of Plautus\r\nand Terence must be dealt with separately.\r\n\r\nThat country life and pursuits had their share of notice on the comic\r\nstage is indicated by the fact that Aristophanes produced a play[254]\r\nnamed Γεωργοί, and Menander a Γεωργός. That the slave-market was active\r\nis attested by references in all periods. So too is wage-earning\r\nlabour of various kinds: but some of these passages certainly refer to\r\nwage-earning by slaves paying a rent (ἀποφορά) to their owners. Also\r\nthe problems arising out of the relation between master and slave, with\r\nrecognition of the necessity of wise management. The difference between\r\nthe man who does know how to control slaves[255] and the man who does not\r\n(εὔδουλος and κακόδουλος) was early expressed, and indirectly alluded to\r\nthroughout. The good and bad side of slaves, loyalty treachery honesty\r\ncheating etc, is a topic constantly handled. But these passages nearly\r\nalways have in view the close relation of domestic slavery. I think we\r\nare justified in inferring that the general tone steadily becomes more\r\nhumane. Common humanity gains recognition as a guide of conduct. Many of\r\nthe fragments have been handed down as being neatly put moral sentences,\r\nand of these not a few[256] recognize the debt that a slave owes to a\r\ngood master. These are utterances of slaves, for the slave as a character\r\nbecame more and more a regular figure of comedy, as comedy became more\r\nand more a drama of private life. Side by side with this tone is the\r\nfrank recognition of the part played by chance[257] in the destinies of\r\nmaster and slave; a very natural reflexion in a state of things under\r\nwhich you had but to be captured and sold out of your own country, out\r\nof the protection of your own laws, to pass from the former condition to\r\nthe latter. A few references to manumission also occur, and the Roman\r\nadaptations suggest that in the later Comedy they were frequent. On\r\nthe other hand several fragments seem to imply that circumstances were\r\nworking unfavourably to the individual free craftsmen, at least in some\r\ntrades. The wisdom of learning a craft (τέχνη), as a resource[258] that\r\ncannot be lost like external possessions, is insisted on. But in other\r\npassages a more despairing view[259] appears; death is better than the\r\npainful struggle for life. No doubt different characters were made to\r\nspeak from different points of view.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that two fragments of the earlier Comedy refer to the\r\nold tradition[260] of a golden age long past, in which there were no\r\nslaves (see under Herodotus), and in which the bounty of nature[261]\r\nprovided an ample supply of food and all good things (see the passages\r\ncited from the _Odyssey_). Athenaeus, who has preserved[262] these\r\nextracts, remarks that the old poets were seeking by their descriptions\r\nto accustom mankind to do their own work with their own hands (αὐτουργοὺς\r\nεἶναι). But it is evident that the subject was treated in the broadest\r\ncomic spirit, as his numerous quotations shew. When in the restoration\r\nof good old times the articles of food are to cook and serve themselves\r\nand ask to be eaten, we must not take the picture very seriously. These\r\npassages do however suggest that there was a food-question at the time\r\nwhen they were written, of sufficient importance to give point to them:\r\npossibly also a labour-question. Now Crates and Pherecrates flourished\r\nbefore the Peloponnesian war and during its earlier years, Nicophon\r\nwas a late contemporary of Aristophanes. The evidence is too slight to\r\njustify a far-reaching conclusion, but it is consistent with the general\r\ninferences drawn from other authorities. In the fragments of the later\r\nComedy we begin to find passages bearing on agriculture, and it is\r\nsurely a mere accident that we do not have them in those of the earlier.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between life in town and life in the country is forcibly\r\nbrought out[263] by Menander. The poor man has no chance in town, where\r\nhe is despised and wronged: in the country he is spared the galling\r\npresence of witnesses, and can bear his ill fortune on a lonely farm.\r\nThe farm then is represented as a sort of refuge from unsatisfactory\r\nsurroundings in the city. When we remember that in Menander’s time Athens\r\nwas a dependency of one or other of Alexander’s Successors, a community\r\nof servile rich and mean poor, fawning on its patrons and enjoying no\r\nreal freedom of state-action, we need not wonder at the poet’s putting\r\nsuch a view into the mouths of some of his characters. The remains of\r\nthe play Γεωργὸς are of particular interest. The old master is a tough\r\nobstinate old fellow, who persists in working[264] on the land himself,\r\nand even wounds himself by clumsy use of his mattock. But he has a staff\r\nof slaves, barbarians, on whom he is dependent. These paid no attention\r\nto the old man in his misfortune; a touch from which we may infer that\r\nthe relations between master and slaves were not sympathetic. But a young\r\nfree labourer in his employ comes to the rescue, nurses him, and sets\r\nhim on his legs again. While laid up, the old man learns by inquiry that\r\nthis youth is his own son, the fruit of a former amour, whom his mother\r\nhas reared in struggling poverty. Enough of the play remains to shew that\r\nthe trials of the free poor were placed in a strong light, and that, as\r\npointed out above, the struggle for existence in the city was felt to\r\nbe especially severe. In this case whether the old man is rich or not\r\ndoes not appear: at all events he has enough property to make amends for\r\nhis youthful indiscretions by relieving the necessities of those who\r\nhave a claim on him. He is probably the character in whose mouth[265]\r\nwere put the words ‘I am a rustic (ἄγροικος); that I don’t deny; and not\r\nfully expert in affairs of city life (lawsuits etc?): but I was not born\r\nyesterday.’\r\n\r\nThe functions of the rustic slaves may give us some notion of the kind\r\nof farms that Menander had in mind. In the Γεωργός, the slave Davus,\r\ncoming in from his day’s labour, grumbles[266] at the land on which he\r\nhas to work: shrubs and flowers of use only for festival decorations grow\r\nthere as vigorous weeds, but when you sow seed you get back what you\r\nsowed with no increase. This savours of the disappointing tillage of an\r\nupland farm. In the Ἐπιτρέποντες[267], Davus is a shepherd, Syriscus a\r\ncharcoal-burner, occupations also proper to the hill districts. We must\r\nnot venture to infer that Attic agriculture was mainly of this type in\r\nthe poet’s day. The favourite motive of plots in the later Comedy, the\r\nexposure of infants in remote spots, their rescue by casual herdsmen\r\nor other slaves, and their eventual identification as the very person\r\nwanted in each case to make all end happily, would of itself suggest\r\nthat lonely hill-farms, rather than big estates in the fat lowland,\r\nshould be the scene. From my point of view the fact of chief interest\r\nis that slave-labour appears as normal in such an establishment. Rustic\r\nclothing[268] and food served out in rations[269] are minor details\r\nof the picture, and the arrangement by which a slave can work as\r\nwage-earner[270] for another employer, paying over a share to his own\r\nmaster (the ἀποφορά), surely indicates that there was nothing exceptional\r\nabout it. There are one or two other fragments directly bearing on\r\nagricultural labour. One of uncertain age[271] speaks of a tiresome\r\nhand who annoys his employer by chattering about some public news from\r\nthe city, when he should be digging. I doubt whether a slave is meant:\r\nat least he is surely a hired one, but why not a poor freeman, reduced\r\nto wage-earning? Such is the position of Timon[272] in Lucian—μισθοῦ\r\nγεωργεῖ—a passage in which adaptations from Comedy are reasonably\r\nsuspected. That rustic labour has a better side to it, that ‘the bitter\r\nof agriculture has a touch of sweet in it,’ is admitted[273] by one of\r\nMenander’s characters, but the passage which seems the most genuine\r\nexpression of the prevalent opinion[274] is that in which we read that a\r\nman’s true part is to excel in war, ‘for agriculture is a bondman’s task’\r\n(τὸ γὰρ γεωργεῖν ἔργον ἐστὶν οἰκέτου).\r\n\r\nThe nature and condition of the evidence must be my excuse for the\r\nunsatisfactory appearance of this section. The number of passages bearing\r\non slavery in general, and the social and moral questions connected\r\ntherewith, is large and remote from my subject. They are of great\r\ninterest as illustrating the movement of thought on these matters, but\r\ntheir bearing on agricultural labour is very slight. To the virtues of\r\nagriculture as a pursuit tending to promote a sound and manly character\r\nMenander[275] bears witness. ‘A farm is for all men a trainer in virtue\r\nand a freeman’s life.’ Many a town-bred man has thought and said the\r\nsame, but praise is not always followed by imitation. Even more striking\r\nis another[276] remark, ‘farms that yield but a poor living make brave\r\nmen.’ For it was the hard-living rustics from the back-country parts\r\nof Greece that succeeded as soldiers of fortune, the famous Greek\r\nmercenaries whose services all contemporary kings were eager to secure.\r\nIn short, to the onlooker it seemed a fine thing to be bred a healthy\r\nrustic, but the rustic himself was apt to prefer a less monotonous and\r\nmore remunerative career.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV. EARLY LAWGIVERS AND THEORISTS.\r\n\r\nThe treatises of the two great philosophers on the state (and therefore\r\non the position of agriculture in the state) did not spring suddenly out\r\nof nothing; nor was it solely the questionings of Socrates[277] that\r\nturned the attention of Plato and Aristotle to the subject. Various\r\nlawgivers had shewn in their systems a consciousness of its importance,\r\nand speculative thinkers outside[278] the ranks of practical statesmen\r\nhad designed model constitutions in which a reformed land-system\r\nplayed a necessary part. It is to Aristotle, the great collector of\r\nexperience, that we owe nearly all our information of these attempts.\r\nIt is convenient to speak of them briefly together. All recognize much\r\nthe same difficulties, and there is a striking similarity in the means\r\nby which they propose to overcome them. The lawgivers[279] referred to\r\nare =Pheidon= of Corinth and =Philolaus=, also a Corinthian though his\r\nlaws were drafted for Thebes, and thirdly[280] =Solon=. The dates of\r\nthe first two are uncertain, but they belong to early times. The two\r\nconstitution-framers[281] are =Hippodamus= of Miletus, whose birth is\r\nplaced about 475 BC, and =Phaleas= of Chalcedon, probably somewhat later.\r\nBoth witnessed the growth of imperial Athens, and Phaleas at least is\r\nthought to have been an elder contemporary of Plato. Very little is known\r\nabout them. If we say that the attempt to design ideal state systems\r\nshews that they were not satisfied with those existing, and that the\r\nfailure of past legislation may have encouraged them to theorize, we have\r\nsaid about all that we are entitled to infer.\r\n\r\nOn one point there was general agreement among Greek states: all desired\r\nto be ‘free’ or independent of external control. For some special purpose\r\none people might for a time be recognized as the Leaders (ἡγεμόνες) of\r\na majority of states, or more permanently as Representatives or Patrons\r\n(προστάται). But these unofficial titles only stood for a position\r\nacquiesced in under pressure of necessity. Each community wanted to live\r\nits own life in its own way, and the extreme jealousy of interference\r\nremained. Side by side with this was an internal jealousy causing\r\nserious friction in most of the several states, at first between nobles\r\nand commons, later between rich and poor. The seditions (στάσεις) arising\r\ntherefrom were causes, not only of inner weakness and other evils, but\r\nin particular of intervention from without Therefore it was often the\r\npolicy of the victors in party strife to expel or exterminate their\r\nopponents, in order to secure to themselves undisputed control of their\r\nown state. This tendency operated to perpetuate the smallness of scale\r\nin Greek states, already favoured by the physical features of the land.\r\nThat the Greeks with all their cleverness never invented what we call\r\nRepresentative Government is no wonder. Men’s views in general were\r\ndirected to the independence of their own state under control of their\r\nown partisans. The smaller the state, the easier it was to organize the\r\ncontrol: independence could only be maintained by military efficiency,\r\nand unanimous loyalty was something to set off against smallness of\r\nnumbers. Moreover the Greek mind had an artistic bent, and the sense of\r\nproportion was more easily and visibly gratified on a smaller scale. The\r\nbulk of Persia did not appear favourable to human freedom and dignity\r\nas understood in Hellas. In the Persian empire there was nothing that\r\na Greek would recognize as citizenship. The citizen of a Greek state\r\nexpected to have some voice in his own government: the gulf between\r\ncitizen and non-citizen was the line of division, but even in Sparta the\r\nfull citizens were equals in legal status among themselves. We may fairly\r\nsay that the principle of equality (τὸ ἴσον) was at the root of Greek\r\nnotions of citizenship. Privilege did not become less odious as it ceased\r\nto rest on ancestral nobility and became more obviously an advantage\r\nclaimed by wealth.\r\n\r\nSince the light thrown on the subject[282] by Dr Grundy, no one will\r\ndispute the importance of economic considerations in Greek policy, and in\r\nparticular of the ever-pressing question of the food-supply. The security\r\nof the land and crops was to most states a vital need, and necessitated\r\nconstant readiness to maintain it in arms. Closely connected therewith\r\nwas the question of distribution. Real property was not only the oldest\r\nand most permanent investment. Long before Aristotle[283] declared\r\nthat ‘the country is a public thing’ (κοινόν), that is an interest of\r\nthe community, that opinion was commonly held, whether formulated or\r\ninstinctive. The position of the landless man was traditionally a dubious\r\none. The general rule was that only a citizen could own land in the\r\nterritory of the state. From this it was no great step to argue that\r\nevery citizen ought to own a plot of land within the borders. This was\r\ndoubtless not always possible. In such a state as Corinth or Megara or\r\nMiletus commercial growth in a narrow territory had led to extensive\r\ncolonization from those centres. And the normal procedure in the\r\nfoundation of Greek colonies was to divide the occupied territory into\r\nlots (κλῆροι) and assign them severally to settlers. In course of time\r\nthe discontents generated by land-monopolizing in old Hellas were liable\r\nto reappear beyond the seas, particularly in colonial states of rapid\r\ngrowth: a notorious instance is found in the troubles arising at Syracuse\r\nout of the squatter-sovranty created by the original colonists. We meet\r\nwith plans for confiscation and redistribution of land as a common\r\nphenomenon of Greek revolutions. The mischievous moral effects of so\r\nunsettling a process on political wellbeing did not escape the notice of\r\nthoughtful observers. But on one important point we have practically no\r\nevidence. Did the new allottees wish to be, and in fact normally become,\r\nworking farmers (αὐτουργοί)? Or did they aim at providing for themselves\r\nan easy life, supported by the labour of slaves? I wish I could surely\r\nand rightly decide between these alternatives. As it is, I can only say\r\nthat I believe the second to be nearer the truth.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions Greek lawgivers and theorists alike seem to have\r\nlooked to much the same measures for remedying evils that they could not\r\nignore. The citizen as landholder is the human figure with which they\r\nare all concerned. To prevent destitution arising from the loss[284] of\r\nhis land-lot is a prime object. Some therefore would forbid the sale of\r\nthe lot. To keep land in the same hands it was necessary to regulate\r\nnumbers of citizen households, and this was attempted[285] in the laws\r\nof Pheidon. Families may die out, so rules to provide for perpetuity by\r\nadoptions[286] were devised by Philolaus. Again, there is the question\r\nof the size of the lots, and this raises the further question of a\r\nlimit to acquisition. Such a limitation is attributed[287] to certain\r\nearly lawgivers not named, and with them apparently to Solon. Phaleas\r\nwould insist on equality of landed estate[288] among his citizens: a\r\nproposal which Aristotle treats as unpractical, referring to only one\r\nform of wealth, and leaving out of account slaves, tame animals, coin,\r\nand the dead-stock tools etc. His exclusive attention to internal civic\r\nwellbeing is also blamed, for it is absurd to disregard the relations\r\nof a state to other states: there must be a foreign policy, therefore\r\nyou must provide[289] military force. The fanciful scheme of Hippodamus,\r\na strange doctrinaire genius, seems to have been in many points\r\ninconsistent from want of attention to practical detail. From Aristotle’s\r\naccount he appears not to have troubled himself with the question of\r\nequal land-lots, but his fixing the number[290] of citizens (10,000) is\r\nevidence that his point of view necessitated a limit. He proceeds on a\r\nsystem of triads. The citizens are grouped in three classes, artisans\r\n(τεχνῖται), husbandmen (γεωργοί), and the military, possessors of arms.\r\nThe land is either sacred (for service of religion, ἱερά), public\r\n(δημοσία or κοινή) or the property of the husbandmen (ἰδία). The three\r\nclasses of land and citizens are to be assumed equal. The military are\r\nto be supported by the produce of the public land. But who cultivates\r\nit? Aristotle shews that the scheme is not fully thought out. If the\r\nsoldiers, then the distinction, obviously intended, between soldier and\r\nfarmer, is lost. If the farmers, then the distinction between the public\r\nand private land is meaningless. If neither, a fourth class, not allowed\r\nfor in the plan, will be required. This last is probably what Hippodamus\r\nmeant: but to particularize the employment of slaves may have appeared\r\nsuperfluous. Into the purely constitutional details I need not enter, but\r\none criticism is so frankly expressive of Greek ideas that it can hardly\r\nbe omitted. What, says Aristotle, is the use of political rights to the\r\nartisans and husbandmen? they are unarmed, and therefore will practically\r\nbe slaves of the military class. This was the truth in Greek politics\r\ngenerally, and is one of the most significant facts to be borne in mind\r\nwhen considering the political failure of the Greeks.\r\n\r\nA curious difference of economic view is shewn in the position assigned\r\nto the artisan[291] or craftsman element by Hippodamus and Phaleas\r\nrespectively. Phaleas would have them state-slaves (δημόσιοι), Hippodamus\r\nmakes them citizens, though unarmed. On the former plan the state would\r\nno doubt feed them and use their produce, as we do with machinery. Of\r\nthe latter plan Aristotle remarks that τεχνῖται are indispensable: all\r\nstates need them, and they can live of the earnings of their crafts, but\r\nthe γεωργοὶ as a distinct class are superfluous. We may reply that, if\r\nthe craftsmen live of their earnings and stick to their several crafts,\r\nthey will need to buy food, and the farmers are surely there to supply\r\nit. The reply is so obvious that one feels as if Aristotle’s meaning had\r\nbeen obscured through some mishap to the text. For the present purpose\r\nit suffices that the professional craftsmen in these two Utopias are\r\nto be either actual slaves or citizens _de iure_ who are _de facto_ as\r\nhelpless as slaves. In the scheme of Hippodamus the farmer-class also are\r\nvirtually the slaves of the military. Another notable point, apparently\r\nneglected by Hippodamus, is the trust reposed in education[292] or\r\ntraining by both Phaleas and his critic. How to implant in your citizens\r\nthe qualities needed for making your institutions work well in practice,\r\nis the problem. Phaleas would give all the same training, on the\r\nsame principle as he gives equal land-lots. To Aristotle this seems\r\ncrude nonsense: the problem to him is the discovery of the appropriate\r\ntraining, whether the same for all or not. This insistence on training as\r\nthe main thing in citizen-making is, as we shall see, a common feature\r\nof Greek political speculation. But in the artistic desire to produce\r\nthe ‘complete citizen,’ and thereby make possible a model state, the\r\nspecializing mania outruns the humbler considerations of everyday human\r\nsociety, and agriculture, for all its confessed importance, is apt to be\r\ntreated with something very like contempt. The tendency to regard farmer\r\nand warrior as distinct classes is unmistakeable. The peasant-soldier of\r\nRoman tradition is not an ordinary Greek figure. How far the small scale\r\nof Greek states may have favoured this differentiation is very hard to\r\nsay. But Greek admiration for the athlete type had probably something to\r\ndo with the growth of military professionalism.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of a land-question and attempts to find a solution were\r\nprobably stimulated by observation of contemporary phenomena, especially\r\nin the two leading states of the fifth century. Sparta had long held\r\nthe first place, and even the rise of Athens had not utterly destroyed\r\nher ancient prestige. That her military system was effective, seemed\r\nproved by the inviolability of Laconian territory and the successes of\r\nher armies in external wars. That it was supported by the labour of a\r\nGreek population reduced to serfdom, was perhaps a weak point in her\r\ninstitutions; but that Greek opinion was seriously shocked by the fact\r\ncan hardly be maintained. It was now and then convenient to use it as\r\na passing reproach, but even Athens did not refuse to aid in putting\r\ndown Helot rebellions. And this weak point was set off by a strong one.\r\nWhatever the reasons[293] for her policy, she interfered very little\r\nin the internal affairs of her allies and did not tax them. To be\r\ncontent with the leadership of confederates, and not to convert it into\r\nan empire of subjects, assured to her a certain amount of respectful\r\nsympathy in the jealous Greek world. Thus she afforded an object-lesson\r\nin the advantages of rigid specialization. She provided her own food\r\nin time of peace, and took her opponents’ food in time of war. The\r\ndisadvantages of her system were yet to appear. Athens on the other\r\nhand was becoming more and more dependent on imported food. She was the\r\nleader of the maritime states and islands: she had become their imperial\r\nmistress. However easy her yoke might be in practice, it left no room\r\nfor independent action on the part of her subject allies: what had been\r\ncontributions from members of a league had become virtually imperial\r\ntaxation, and to Greek prejudices such taxation appeared tyranny. Nor was\r\nthis prejudice allowed to die out. The rival interests of commercial\r\nCorinth saw to it that the enslavement, not of Greeks but of Greek\r\nstates, should be continually borne in mind. The contrast between the\r\ntwo leading powers was striking. But, if many Greek states feared in\r\nAthens a menace to their several independence, on the other hand they\r\nshrank from copying the rigid discipline of Sparta. No wonder that some\r\nof the more imaginative minds had dreams of a system more congenial to\r\nGreek aspirations. But the land-question was a stumbling-block. That a\r\ncitizen should take an active personal share in politics was assumed, and\r\nthat he should do this tended to make him depute non-political duties to\r\nothers. Thus the notion that all citizens should be equal in the eye of\r\nthe law and share in government—democracy in short—was not favourable to\r\npersonal labour on the land. No distribution of land-lots could convert\r\nthe city politician into a real working farmer. Therefore either there\r\nmust be a decline in agriculture or an increase of slave-labour, or both.\r\nFrom these alternatives there was no escape: but ingenious schemers long\r\nstrove to find a way. And from those days to these no one has succeeded\r\nin constructing a sound and lasting civilization on a basis of slavery.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV. PLATO.\r\n\r\nAn Athenian who died in 347 BC at the age of 80 or 82 years had witnessed\r\nextraordinary changes in the Hellenic world, more particularly in the\r\nposition of Athens. With the political changes we are not here directly\r\nconcerned. But they were closely connected with economic changes, both as\r\ncause and as effect. The loss of empire[294] entailed loss of revenue.\r\nThe amounts available as state-pay being reduced, the poorer citizens\r\nlost a steady source of income: that their imperial pride had departed\r\ndid not tend to make them less sensitive to the pinch of poverty. Athens,\r\nthrown back upon her own limited resources, had to produce what she could\r\nin order to buy what she needed, and capital, employing slave-labour,\r\nfound its opportunity. In this atmosphere discontent and jealousy grew\r\nfast: conflicting interests of rich and poor were at the back of all\r\nthe disputes of political life. Athens it is true avoided the crude\r\nrevolutionary methods adopted in some less civilized states. The Demos\r\ndid not massacre or banish the wealthy Few, and share out their lands\r\nand other properties among the poor Many. But they consistently regarded\r\nthe estates of the rich as the source from which the public outlay\r\nshould as far as possible be drawn. They left the capitalist free to\r\nmake money in his own way, and squeezed him when he had made it. Whether\r\nhe were citizen or metic[295] mattered not from the economic point of\r\nview. Capitalistic industry was really slave-industry. The ‘small man’\r\nhad the choice of either competing, perhaps vainly, with the ‘big man’\r\non the land or in the workshop, or of giving up the struggle and using\r\nhis political power to make the ‘big man’ disgorge some of his profits.\r\nMoreover military life no longer offered the prospects of conquest and\r\ngain that had made it attractive. The tendency was to treat the citizen\r\narmy as a defensive force, and to employ professional mercenaries (of\r\nwhom there was now[296] no lack) on foreign service. To a thoughtful\r\nobserver these phenomena suggested uneasy reflexions. Demos in Assembly\r\nwas a dispiriting spectacle. Selfish[297] and shortsighted, he cared\r\nmore for his own belly and his amusements than for permanent interests\r\nof state. Perhaps this was no new story. But times had changed, and the\r\nwealthy imperial Athens, able to support the burden of her own defects,\r\nhad passed away. Bad government in reduced circumstances might well be\r\nproductive of fatal results.\r\n\r\nIt was not Athens alone that had failed. Fifteen years before\r\nPlato’s death the failure of both Sparta and Thebes had left Hellas\r\nexhausted[298] and without a leading state to give some sort of unity\r\nto Greek policy. There was still a common Hellenic feeling, but it was\r\nweak compared with separatist jealousy. Antipathy to the Barbarian\r\nremained: but the Persian power had been called in by Greeks to aid them\r\nagainst other Greeks, and this was a serious danger to the Greek world.\r\nThings were even worse in the West. How anarchic democracy had paved the\r\nway for military tyranny at Syracuse, how the tyranny had lowered the\r\nstandard of Greek civilization in Sicily and Italy, and had been the\r\nruin of Greek cities, no man of that age knew better than Plato. Plato\r\nwas not singular in his distrust of democracy: that attitude was common\r\nenough. Among the companions of Socrates I need only refer to Xenophon\r\nand Critias. Socrates had insisted that government is a difficult art,\r\nfor success in which a thorough training is required. Now, whatever\r\nmight be the case in respect of tyrannies or oligarchies, democracy\r\nwas manifestly an assertion of the principle that all citizens were\r\nalike qualified for a share in the work of government. Yet no craftsman\r\nwould dream of submitting the work of his own trade to the direction of\r\namateurs. Why then should the amateur element, led by amateurs, dominate\r\nin the sphere of politics? It was easy to find instances of the evil\r\neffects of amateurism in public affairs. It is true that this line of\r\nargument contained a fallacy, as arguments from analogy very often\r\ndo. But it had a profound influence on Plato, and it underlay all his\r\npolitical speculations. It was reinforced by an influence that affected\r\nmany of his contemporaries, admiration of Sparta on the score of the\r\npermanence[299] of her system of government. That this admiration was\r\nmisguided, and the permanence more apparent than real, matters not: to a\r\nGreek thinker it was necessarily attractive, seeking for some possibly\r\npermanent principle of government, and disgusted with the everlasting\r\nflux of Hellenic politics. Nor was there anything strange in imagining an\r\nideal state in which sound principles might be carried into effect. The\r\nfoundation of colonies, in which the settlers made a fresh start as new\r\ncommunities, was traditionally a Greek custom. Such was the foundation,\r\nlogical and apparently consistent with experience, on which Plato\r\ndesigned to build an Utopia. Avoiding the unscientific _laisser-faire_ of\r\ndemocratic politics, functions were to be divided on a rational system,\r\nand government placed in the hands of trained specialists.\r\n\r\nIt is well to note some of the defects of Greek civilization as Plato\r\nsaw it, particularly in Athens. The confusion and weakness of democratic\r\ngovernment, largely the fruit of ignorance haste and prejudice, has\r\nbeen referred to above. In most states the free citizen population\r\nwere born and bred at the will of their fathers under no scientific\r\nstate-regulation, not sifted out in youth by scientific selection, and\r\nonly trained up to the average standard locally approved. Something\r\nbetter was needed, if more was to be got out of human capacity. But it\r\nseems certain that Plato found the chief and most deep-seated source\r\nof social and political evils in the economic situation. The unequal\r\ndistribution of wealth and the ceaseless struggle between rich and\r\npoor lay at the root of that lack of harmonious unity in which he saw\r\nthe cause of the weakness and unhappiness of states. To get rid of\r\nthe plutocrat and the beggar[300] was a prime object. Confiscation\r\nand redistribution[301] offered no lasting remedy, so long as men\r\nremained what they were. A complete moral change was necessary, and this\r\ncould only be effected by an education that should train all citizens\r\ncheerfully and automatically to bear their several parts in promoting\r\nthe happiness of all. There must be no more party-strivings after\r\nthe advantage of this or that section: the guiding principle must be\r\ndiversity of individual functions combined with unity of aim. An ideal\r\nstate must be the Happy Land of the Expert, and each specialist must\r\nmind his own business. Thus each will enjoy his own proper happiness:\r\nfriction competition and jealousy will pass away. There will be no more\r\nhindrance to the efficiency of craftsmen: we shall not see one tempted\r\nby wealth[302] to neglect his trade, while another is too poor to buy\r\nthe appliances needed for turning out good work. The expert governors\r\nor Guardians must be supplied with all necessaries[303] by the classes\r\nengaged in the various forms of production. Thus only can they be removed\r\nfrom the corruptions that now pervert politicians. To them at least all\r\nprivate property must be denied. And, in order that they may be as expert\r\nin their own function of government as other craftsmen are in their\r\nseveral trades, they must be bred selected and educated on a strictly\r\nscientific system the very opposite of the haphazard methods now in vogue.\r\n\r\nThis brief sketch of the critical and constructive scope of the\r\n_Republic_ must suffice for my purpose. Plato laid his finger on grave\r\ndefects, but his remedies seem fantastic in the light of our longer and\r\nmore varied experience. Any reform of society had to be carried out\r\nby human agency, and for the difficulty of adapting this no adequate\r\nallowance is made. He recognizes the difficulty of starting an ideal\r\ncommunity on his model. Old prejudices will be hard to overcome. So he\r\nsuggests[304] that it will be necessary for the philosophical rulers\r\nto clear the ground by sending all the adult inhabitants out into\r\nthe country, keeping in the city only the children of ten years and\r\nunder: these they will train up on their system. He implies that with\r\nthe younger generation growing up under properly regulated conditions\r\nthe problems of establishment will solve themselves by the effect of\r\ntime. This grotesque proposal may indicate that Plato did not mean his\r\nconstructive design to be taken very seriously. But a more notable\r\nweakness appears in the narrowness of outlook. It was natural that a\r\nGreek should think and write as a Greek for Greeks, and seek lessons in\r\nGreek experience. But the blight of disunion and failure was already\r\non the little Greek states; and their experience, not likely to recur,\r\nhas in fact never really recurred. Hence the practical value of Plato’s\r\nstimulating criticism and construction is small. In the labour-question\r\nwe find no advance. Slavery is assumed as usual, but against the\r\nenslavement of Greeks, of which recent warfare supplied many examples,\r\nhe makes[305] a vigorous protest. Euripides had gone further than this,\r\nand questionings of slavery had not been lacking. Another very Greek\r\nlimitation of view comes out in the contempt[306] for βαναυσία, the\r\nassumed physical and moral inferiority of persons occupied in sedentary\r\ntrades. That such men were unfitted for the rough work of war, and\r\ntherefore unfitted to take part in ruling an independent Greek state,\r\nwas an opinion not peculiar to Plato. But this objection could not well\r\nbe raised against the working farmer. Why then does Plato exclude the\r\nfarmer-class from a share in the government of his ideal state? I think\r\nwe may detect three reasons. First, the husbandman, though necessary\r\nto the state’s existence, has not the special training required for\r\ngovernment, nor the leisure to acquire it. Second, it is his intense\r\noccupation that alone secures to the ruling class the leisure needful for\r\ntheir responsible duties. Third, the belief[307] that a man cannot be at\r\nthe same time a good husbandman and a good soldier. These three may be\r\nregarded as one: the philosopher would get rid of haphazard amateurism\r\nby making the expert specialist dominant in all departments of civil and\r\nmilitary life. The influence of the Spartan system (much idealized), and\r\nthe growth of professional soldiering, on his theories is too obvious to\r\nneed further comment.\r\n\r\nReading the _Republic_ from the labour-question point of view, one is\r\nstruck by the lack of detail as to the condition of the classes whose\r\nlabour feeds and clothes the whole community. We must remember that the\r\ndialogue starts with an attempt to define Justice, in the course of which\r\na wider field of inquiry is opened up by assuming an analogy[308] between\r\nthe individual and the state. As the dominance of his nobler element over\r\nhis baser elements is the one sure means of ensuring the individual’s\r\nlasting happiness, so the dominance of the nobler element in the state\r\nalone offers a like guarantee. On these lines the argument proceeds,\r\nusing an arbitrary psychology, and a fanciful political criticism to\r\ncorrespond. The construction of a model state is rather incidental than\r\nessential to the discussion. No wonder that, while we have much detail\r\nas to the bodily and mental equipment of the ‘Guardians’ (both the\r\ngoverning elders and the warrior youths) we get no information as to the\r\ntraining of husbandmen and craftsmen. Like slaves, they are assumed to\r\nexist: how they become and remain what they are assumed to be, we are\r\nnot told. We are driven to guess that at this stage of his speculations\r\nPlato was content to take over these classes just as he found them in\r\nthe civilization of his day. But he can hardly have imagined that they\r\nwould acquiesce in any system by which they would be excluded from all\r\npolitical power. The hopeless inferiority of the husbandman is most\r\nclearly marked when contrasted with the young warriors of the ‘Guardian’\r\nclass. Duties are so highly specialized that men are differentiated\r\nfor life. The γεωργὸς cannot be a good soldier. But if a soldier\r\nshews cowardice he is to be punished[309] by being made a γεωργὸς or\r\nδημιουργός—a degradation in itself, and accompanied by no suggestion of\r\na special training being required to fit him for his new function. It is\r\nunnecessary to enlarge on such points: constructors of Utopias cannot\r\navoid some inconsistencies and omissions. The simple fact is that the\r\narrangements for differentiation of classes in the model state are not\r\nfully worked out in detail.\r\n\r\nPlato’s Guardians are to have no private property; for it is private\r\nproperty[310] that seems to him the cause of sectional and personal\r\ninterests which divide and weaken the state and lead to unhappiness. But\r\nthe other classes are not so restricted. They can own land and houses\r\netc; on exactly what tenure, is less clear. Meanwhile, what is it that\r\nthe Guardians have in common? It is the sustenance (τροφὴ) provided as\r\npay (μισθὸς) for their services by the mass of workers over whom they\r\nrule. It is expressly stated[311] that in the model state the Demos will\r\ncall the Rulers their Preservers and Protectors, and the Rulers call the\r\nDemos their Paymasters and Sustainers. In existing states other than\r\ndemocracies their mutual relation is too often expressed as that of\r\nMasters and Slaves. I cannot refrain from noting that, if the pay of the\r\nGuardians consists in their sustenance, this is so far exactly the case\r\nof slaves. That power and honour should be reserved for men maintained\r\nthus, without private emoluments, is remarkable. The Spartiates, however\r\nmuch an idealizing of their system may have suggested the arrangement,\r\nwere maintained by the sulky labour of Helot serfs. Are the husbandmen in\r\nPlato’s scheme really any better than Helots? In describing the origin\r\nof states in general, Plato finds the cause[312] of that development in\r\nthe insufficiency of individuals to meet their own needs. But in tracing\r\nthe process of the division of labour, and increasing complexity of\r\ncivilization, he ignores slavery, though slavery is often referred to\r\nin various parts of the book. Now, if the husbandman has under him no\r\nslaves, and is charged with the food-supply of his rulers, he comes very\r\nnear to the economic status of a serf. He works with his own hands, but\r\nnot entirely at his own will or for his own profit. And in one respect he\r\nwould, to Greek critics, seem inferior to a Spartan[313] Helot: he is, by\r\nthe extreme specializing system, denied all share in military service,\r\nand so can hardly be reckoned a citizen at all. How came Plato to imagine\r\nfor a single moment that a free Greek would acquiesce in such a position?\r\nI can only guess that the present position of working farmers and\r\ncraftsmen in trades seemed to him an intolerable one. If, as I believe\r\nfrom the indications in Xenophon and other authorities, agriculture\r\nand the various industries of Attica were now steadily passing into\r\nthe hands of slaveowning capitalists, and small men going to the wall,\r\nthere would be much to set a philosopher thinking and seeking some\r\nway of establishing a wholesomer state of things. On this supposition\r\nspeculations, however fantastic and incapable of realization in fact,\r\nmight call attention to practical evils and at least prepare men’s minds\r\nfor practical remedies. In admitting the difficulty of making a fresh\r\nstart, and the certainty that even his model state would in time lose its\r\npurity[314] and pass through successive phases of decay, Plato surely\r\nwarns us not to take his constructive scheme seriously. But whether\r\nhe really believed that free handworkers could (save in an oligarchy,\r\nwhich[315] he detests,) be induced to submit to a ruling class, and be\r\nthemselves excluded on principle from political interests of any kind, is\r\nmore than I can divine.\r\n\r\nThat the scheme outlined in the _Republic_ was not a practical one was\r\nconfessed by Plato in his old age by producing the _Laws_, a work in\r\nwhich the actual circumstances of Greek life were not so completely\r\ndisregarded. The main points that concern us are these. Government is to\r\nbe vested in a detailed code of laws, administered by magistrates elected\r\nby the citizens. There is a Council and an Assembly. Pressure is put upon\r\nvoters, especially[316] on the wealthier voters, to make them vote. The\r\ninfluence of the Solonian model is obvious. Provision is made[317] for\r\ngetting over the difficulties of the first start, while the people are\r\nstill under old traditions which the new educational system will in due\r\ncourse supersede. But, so far from depending on perfect Guardians with\r\nabsolute power, and treating law as a general pattern[318] modifiable in\r\napplication by the Guardians at their discretion, we have law supreme and\r\nGuardians dependent on the people’s will. It is a kind of democracy, but\r\nDemos is to be carefully trained, and protected from his own vagaries\r\nby minute regulations. The number of citizens[319] is by law fixed at\r\n5040. Each one has an allotment of land, a sacred κλῆρος that cannot\r\nbe sold. This passes by inheritance from father to son as an undivided\r\nwhole. Extinction of a family may be prevented by adoptions under strict\r\nrules. Excess of citizen population may be relieved by colonies. Poverty\r\nis excluded[320] by the minimum guaranteed in the inalienable land-lot,\r\nexcessive wealth by laws fixing a maximum. It is evident that in this\r\ndetailed scheme of the _Laws_ agriculture must have its position more\r\nclearly defined than in the _Republic_.\r\n\r\nSo indeed it has. In order that all may have a fair share, each\r\ncitizen’s land-lot[321] is in two parts, one near the city, the other\r\nnear the frontier. Thus we see that all citizens will be interested\r\nin cultivating the land. We see also that this will be absolutely\r\nnecessary: for it is intended[322] that the model state shall not be\r\ndependent on imported food (like Athens), but produce its own supply.\r\nIndeed commerce is to be severely restricted. What the country cannot\r\nproduce must if necessary be bought, and for this purpose only[323]\r\nwill a recognized Greek currency be employed: internal transactions\r\nwill be conducted with a local coinage. The evil effects[324] seen to\r\nresult from excessive commercial dealings will thus be avoided. When\r\nwe turn to the agricultural labour-question, we find that wholesale\r\nemployment of slaves[325] or serfs is the foundation of the system. For\r\nPlato, holding fast to the principle of specialization, holds also that\r\nleisure[326] is necessary for the citizens if they are to bear their part\r\nin politics with intelligent judgment. As, in this second-best Utopia,\r\nthe citizens are the landowners, and cannot divest themselves of their\r\ncivic responsibilities, they must do their cultivating by deputy. And\r\nthis practically amounts to building the fabric of civilization on a\r\nbasis of slavery—nothing less. In the matter of agriculture, the industry\r\non which this self-sufficing community really rests, this dependence\r\non slave-labour is most striking. It even includes a system[327] of\r\nserf-tenants (probably for the borderland farms) who are to be left\r\nto cultivate the land, paying a rent or quota of produce (ἀπαρχὴ) to\r\nthe owners. The importance of not having too large a proportion[328]\r\nof the slaves in a gang drawn from any one race is insisted on as a\r\nmeans of preventing combinations and risings. At the same time careful\r\nmanagement is enjoined, sympathetic[329] but firm: a master should be\r\nkind, but never forget that he is a master: no slave must be allowed to\r\ntake liberties. To implant a sound tradition of morality is recognized\r\nas a means of promoting good order in the community, and this influence\r\nshould be brought to bear[330] on slaves as well as on freemen. Yet\r\nthe intrinsic chattelhood of the slave appears clearly in many ways;\r\nfor instance, the damage to a slave is made good by compensating[331]\r\nhis owner. The carelessness of ill-qualified practitioners[332] who\r\ntreat slaves, contrasted with the zeal of competent doctors in treating\r\nfreemen, is another significant touch.\r\n\r\nIt seems then that Plato, the more he adapts his speculations to\r\nthe facts of existing civilization, the more positively he accepts\r\nslave-labour as a necessary basis. The conception of government\r\nas an art is surely the chief cause of this attitude. The extreme\r\nspecialization of the _Republic_ is moderated in the _Laws_, but there\r\nis not much less demand for leisure, if the civic artists are to be\r\nunhampered in the practice of their art. Of the dangers[333] of servile\r\nlabour on a large scale he was well aware, and he had evidently studied\r\nwith attention[334] the awkward features of serfdom, not only in the\r\nold Hellas, but in the Greek colonial states of the East and West.\r\nNevertheless he would found his economy on the forced labour of human\r\nchattels. A system that had grown up in the course of events, extending\r\nor contracting according to changes of economic circumstance, was thus\r\npresented as the deliberate result of independent thought. But the\r\nonly theory at the back of traditional slavery was the law[335] of\r\nsuperior force—originally the conqueror’s will. Plato was therefore\r\ndriven to accept this law as a principle of human society. To accept\r\nit was to bring his speculations more into touch with Greek notions;\r\nfor no people have surpassed the Greeks in readiness to devolve upon\r\nothers the necessary but monotonous drudgery of life. This attitude of\r\nhis involves the conclusion that the Barbarian is to serve the Greek, a\r\nposition hardly consistent with his earlier[336] doctrine, that no true\r\nline could be drawn distinguishing Greek and Barbarian. Such a flux of\r\nspeculative opinion surely weakens our respect for Plato’s judgment in\r\nthese matters. We can hardly say that he offers any effective solution of\r\nthe great state-problems of his age. But that these problems were serious\r\nand disquieting his repeated efforts bear witness. And one of the most\r\nserious was certainly that of placing the agricultural interest on a\r\nsound footing. Its importance he saw: but neither of his schemes, neither\r\npassive free farmers nor slave-holding landlords, was likely to produce\r\nthe desired result. To say this is not to blame a great man’s failure.\r\nCenturies have passed, and experience has been gained, without a complete\r\nsolution being reached: the end is not yet.\r\n\r\nA few details remain to be touched on separately. The employment of hired\r\nlabourers is referred to as normal[337] in the _Politicus_ _Republic_\r\nand _Laws_. They are regarded simply as so much physical strength at\r\ndisposal. They are free, and so able to transfer their labour from job\r\nto job according to demand. Intellectually and politically they do not\r\ncount. But the μισθωτὸς is neither a chattel like the slave, nor bound\r\nto the soil like the serf. I have found no suggestion of the employment\r\nof this class in agriculture; and, as I have said above, I believe that\r\nthey were in fact almost confined to the towns, especially such as the\r\nPeiraeus. It is also worth noticing that we find favourable mention of\r\napprenticeship[338] as a method of learning a trade. But this principle\r\nalso seems not applied to agriculture. Again, we are told[339] in the\r\n_Laws_ that one who has never served (δουλεύσας) will never turn out a\r\ncreditable master (δεσπότης). From the context this would seem to refer\r\nonly to the wardens of the country (ἀγρονόμοι), who must be kept under\r\nstrict discipline in order to perform very responsible duties. It does\r\nnot apply to farmers. Another curious rule[340] is that kidnapping of\r\nmen is not to be allowed. Yet there are bought slaves, and therefore a\r\nmarket. That the dealer in human flesh should be despised[341] by his\r\ncustomers is a feeling probably older than Plato, and it lasted down\r\nto the days of _Uncle Tom’s Cabin_. In view of Plato’s acceptance of\r\nthe sharp line drawn between Greek and Barbarian (and this does touch\r\nrustic slavery) it is interesting to note that he observed[342] with\r\ncare the different characters of alien peoples. He also refers[343] to\r\nthem without contempt in various contexts side by side with Greeks, and\r\ncites[344] their common belief as a proof of the existence of the gods.\r\n\r\nIf I may venture to make a general comment on Plato’s position in\r\nrelation to the labour-question, I would remark that he is already in\r\nthe same difficulty which proved embarrassing to Aristotle, and which\r\nhas always beset those who seek to find a theoretical justification for\r\nslavery. True, he is less definite and positive than Aristotle, but the\r\nattempt to regard a human being as both a man and a chattel is a failure.\r\nThis point need not be further pressed here. But it is well to observe\r\nthat agriculture is the department in which the absurdity most strikingly\r\nappears. Heavy farm-labour without prospect of personal advantage was\r\nrecognized as a function that no man would willingly perform. Hence to\r\nbe sent to labour on a farm was one of the punishments that awaited the\r\noffending domestic slave. Hence overseers were employed to exact from\r\nrustic slaves their daily task under the menace of severe and often cruel\r\npunishments. Hence the humaner masters (as Xenophon shews us) tried to\r\nsecure more cheerful and effective service by a system of little rewards\r\nfor good work. In short there was in practical life a miserable attempt\r\nto treat the slave both as a brute beast and as a moral being capable\r\nof weighing consequences and acting accordingly. One form of reward,\r\nmanumission, was apparently not at this time common[345] in Greece:\r\nand it was one not easy to apply in agriculture. It was not easy to\r\nknow what to do with a worn-out farm-hand, unless he was transferred to\r\nlighter duties on the farm; for he would be useless elsewhere. Sooner or\r\nlater a time would come when he could no longer do anything of any value.\r\nWhat then? Was he charitably fed by the master[346] whom he had served,\r\nor was he cast adrift in nominal freedom? From the fragments of Comedy\r\none may perhaps guess that the humaner practice generally prevailed. But\r\nthe silence of Plato seems to suggest that to him, and indeed to Greeks\r\ngenerally, the point was not an important one. Even for a citizen, if\r\ndestitute in old age, the state-relief was very small. We must therefore\r\nnot wonder at the silence generally maintained as to the treatment of the\r\nworn-out rustic slave. Slave artisans, and those whose services were let\r\nout to other employers with reservation of a rent to their own masters,\r\ncould scrape together the means of sustenance in their old age. It is\r\npossible that manumission of rustic slaves may have occasionally taken\r\nplace, and that they too may have scraped together some small savings:\r\nbut I can find no ground for thinking that such cases were normal or even\r\nfrequent. In the _Laws_ Plato allows for the presence of freedmen[347],\r\nand frames regulations for their control, probably suggested by\r\nexperience of the Attic laws and their defects. Manumission by the\r\nstate[348] as reward of slave-informers is also mentioned. But there\r\nis nothing in these passages to weaken the natural inference that town\r\nslaves, and chiefly domestics, are the class to whom in practice such\r\nrules would apply. In short, we must not look to a philosopher reared in\r\na civilization under which manual labour tended to become the burden of\r\nthe unfree and the destitute, and to be despised as mean and unworthy of\r\nthe free citizen, for a wholesome solution of the problem of farm-labour.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI. THE EARLIER ATTIC ORATORS.\r\n\r\nIt is convenient to take the speeches and pamphlets of the masters of\r\nAttic oratory in two sections, though there can be no exact chronological\r\ndivision between the two. The political background is different in the\r\ntwo cases. To Isocrates the urgent problem is how to compose Greek\r\njealousies by uniting in an attack on the common enemy, Persia: to\r\nDemosthenes it is how to save the separate independence of the weary\r\nGreek states from the control of the encroaching king of Macedon. True,\r\nthe disunion of Greece was not to be ended by either effort. But the\r\ndifficulties of Isocrates lay largely outside Athens: the states did not\r\nwant to have a leader; Philip, to whom he turned in his old age, was no\r\nmore welcome to them than the rest of his proposed leaders. Demosthenes\r\nhad to face the fact of a Macedonian party in Athens itself, as well as\r\nto overcome the apathy and inertia which had been growing continually\r\nsince the fall of the Athenian empire. His opponents were not all mere\r\ncorrupt partisans of the Macedonian king. Athens was now no longer a\r\ngreat power, and they knew it: Demosthenes is forgiven by historians for\r\nhis splendid defiance of facts. Naturally enough, in the conflicts of\r\npolitical opinion from the time of the revolution of the Four Hundred\r\nto the death of Demosthenes (411-322 BC) we have few references to\r\nagriculture. Yet we know that the question of food-supply was still a\r\npressing one for many Greek states, above all for Athens. Some of the\r\nreferences have a value as being contemporary. But a large part of these\r\nare references to litigation, and deal not with conditions of cultivation\r\nbut with claims to property. Among the most significant facts are the\r\nimportance attached to the control of the Hellespontine trade-route and\r\nthe careful regulations affecting the import and distribution[349] of\r\ncorn.\r\n\r\nThe period on which we get some little light from passages in the\r\nearlier orators is roughly about 410-350 BC. It includes the general\r\nabandonment of agricultural enterprises abroad, owing to the loss of\r\nempire and therewith of cleruchic properties. By this shrinkage the\r\nrelative importance of home agriculture must surely have been increased.\r\nYet I cannot find a single direct statement or reference to this effect.\r\nIt seems reasonable to suppose that it was not necessary to assert what\r\nwas only too obvious. Corn had to be imported, and imported it was from\r\nvarious[350] sources of supply. To guard against failure of this supply\r\nwas a chief preoccupation of the Athenian government. But that some corn\r\nwas still grown in Attica is clear. Isocrates says[351] that one act of\r\nhostility to the Thirty was the destruction of corn in the country by the\r\ndemocrats. And in another place[352] he lays stress upon the mythical\r\nlegend of the earliest introduction of corn-growing, the civilizing gift\r\nof Demeter to her favoured Attica. Yet there are signs that the culture\r\nof the olive and vine was more and more displacing cereal crops: the fig\r\ntree, often a sacred thing, was, and had long been, a regular feature\r\nof the countryside. Live stock, goats sheep and cattle, were probably\r\nabundant, though there was seldom need for an orator to mention them.\r\nIf we judge by the remaining references, it would seem that land was\r\nnot generally cultivated by its owners. Letting to tenant farmers[353]\r\nwas the plan adopted by the state in dealing with public lands, and\r\nthe collection of the rents was farmed out in its turn to capitalist\r\nspeculators by public auction. We have several specimens[354] of mixed\r\nestates, described by an orator in connexion with some litigation. From\r\nthese we may fairly infer that the policy of not putting all their\r\neggs into one basket found favour with Athenian capitalists. Landed\r\nestate is in such cases but one item, side by side with house-property,\r\nmortgages and money at interest on other securities, slaves and other\r\nstock employed or leased to employers, stock in hand, specie and other\r\nvaluables, mentioned in more or less detail. Consistently with this\r\npicture of landlord and tenant is the statement[355] that formerly, in\r\nthe good old times before Athens entered upon her ill-starred career\r\nof imperialism, the country houses and establishments of citizens\r\nwere superior to those within the city walls; so much so, that even\r\nthe attraction of festivals could not draw them to town from their\r\ncomfortable country-seats. Evidently a great change had come over rural\r\nAttica, if the writer is to be trusted. We are not to suppose that\r\npersonal direction of a farm by the owner of the land was altogether\r\na thing of the past. Suburban farms at least were, as we learn from\r\nXenophon, sometimes managed by men living in the city and riding out to\r\nsuperintend operations and give orders. The injured husband[356] defended\r\nby =Lysias= may even have gone to and fro on foot. He does not seem to\r\nhave been a wealthy man, and he may have been a αὐτουργός, taking part in\r\nthe labours of his farm: that he earned his night’s rest and slept sound\r\nseems suggested by the context of his curious story.\r\n\r\nThat there was no lack of interest in the prospects of agriculture\r\ngenerally may be inferred from various references to the different\r\nqualities of soils not only in Attica but in other parts of Greece and\r\nabroad. The smallness of the cultivable area in rocky Samothrace[357]\r\nwas noted by =Antiphon=. =Isocrates= remarked[358] that in Laconia the\r\nDorian conquerors appropriated not only the greater part of the land\r\nbut the most fertile. The results of their greed and oppression had not\r\nbeen wholly satisfactory in the long run: adversity carried with it the\r\nperil[359] of Helot risings. No fertility of soil can compensate for\r\nthe ill effects of bad policy and lack of moderation: the independence\r\nand wellbeing of cramped rocky Megara, contrasted[360] with the\r\nembarrassments of wide fruitful Thessaly, is an object-lesson. The\r\nGreek race needs to expand[361], as it did of old, when Athens led the\r\ncolonization of the Asiatic seaboard. It is monstrous to try and wring\r\ncontributions from (δασμολογεῖν)[362] the islanders, who have to till\r\nmountain sides for lack of room. It is in Asia that the new Greece must\r\nfind relief, at the expense of Persia, whose subjects let vast areas\r\nlie idle, while the parts that they do cultivate keep them in great\r\nplenty; so fertile is the land. Attica itself was once a prosperous\r\nfarming country. In the good old days, before the unhappy dissension\r\nbetween selfish rich and grudging poor, agriculture was one of the chief\r\nmeans[363] used to avert poverty and distress. Farms let at fair rents\r\nkept the people profitably employed, and so out of mischief. Men could\r\nand did[364] live well in the country: they were not jostling each other\r\nin the city to earn a bare subsistence by pitiful state-fees—beggars\r\nall—as they are doing now. The great pamphleteer may be overdrawing his\r\npicture, but that it contains much truth is certain, and it seems pretty\r\nclear that he saw no prospect of a local revival. Athens had run her\r\ncourse of ambitious imperialism, and the old country life, developed in\r\nlong security, could not be restored. Any man who felt inclined to live\r\na farmer’s life would, if I read the situation aright, prefer some cheap\r\nand profitable venture abroad to the heavy and unremunerative struggles\r\nof a crofter in upland Attica. Small farms in the rich lowland were I\r\ntake it very seldom to be had. And, if he had the capital to work a large\r\nfarm, he was under strong temptation to employ his capital in urban\r\nindustries, state-contracts, loans at interest, etc, and so to distribute\r\nhis risks while increasing his returns. For his main object was to\r\nmake money, not to provide himself and his family with a healthy and\r\ncomfortable home. The land-question in Attica is illustrated by a passage\r\nof =Isaeus= in which he refers to the fraud of a guardian. The scoundrel,\r\nhe says, has robbed his nephew of the estate: he is sticking to the farm\r\n(τὸν ἀγρόν) and has given him a hill pasture[365] (φελλέα).\r\n\r\nFarming enterprise abroad had been a product of the Athenian empire\r\nwith its cleruchies and colonies, and probably private ventures of\r\nindividuals, unofficial but practically resting on imperial protection.\r\nThe collapse of this system would ruin some settlers and speculators,\r\nand impoverish more. Even those who returned to Athens still possessed\r\nof considerable capital would not in all cases take to Attic farming,\r\neven supposing that they were willing to face its risks and that suitable\r\nfarms were available. It was to Athens a most important object to retain\r\nor recover all she could of her island territories, partly no doubt in\r\norder to control the cultivable lands in them. In the peace-negotiations\r\nof 390 BC the extreme opposition party at Athens were not content[366]\r\nwith the proposals by which she was to recover the islands of Lemnos\r\nImbros and Scyros: they demanded also the restitution of the Thracian\r\nChersonese and estates and debts elsewhere. So strong was the feeling of\r\ndependence on these investments abroad. And =Isocrates=, in depicting the\r\nevil results of imperial ambition, recalls[367] to the citizens that,\r\ninstead of farming the lands of others, the Peloponnesian war had for\r\nyears prevented them from setting eyes upon their own.\r\n\r\nThus far I have said nothing of the labour-question. Orators and\r\npamphleteers were not likely to concern themselves much with this topic,\r\nfor there was nothing in the nature of an Abolitionist controversy\r\nto bring them into discussion of the subject. Slavery is in this\r\ndepartment of Greek literature more a fundamental assumption than ever.\r\nThe frequent arguments on the torture of slave witnesses and the moral\r\nvalue of evidence so extracted are plain proof of this. But what about\r\nagricultural labour? In the case of the sacred olive-stump we hear from\r\n=Lysias=[368] that the farm in question several times changed hands by\r\nsale. Some of the purchasers let it to tenants. The words used of the\r\npersons who actually farmed it from time to time are the usual ones,\r\nἐγεώργει, εἰργάσατο etc. That these tenants were not merely αὐτουργοί,\r\nbut employers of labour, may fairly be guessed from the case of the\r\npresent tenant, accused of sacrilege. He at least is an owner of slaves,\r\nand argues[369] that he could never have been so mad as to put himself\r\nat their mercy. They would have witnessed his sacrilege, and could have\r\nwon their freedom by informing against their master. Isocrates[370] draws\r\nno real distinction between serfs and slaves in the case of Sparta. Here\r\ntoo the slave was dangerous, though in a different way: but he was on\r\nthe land. A fragment of =Isaeus=[371] runs ‘he left on the farm old men\r\nand cripples.’ The context is lost, but the persons referred to must\r\nsurely be slaves: no one would employ wage-labour of this quality. In\r\nanother place he casually mentions[372] the sale of a flock of goats with\r\nthe goatherd. These little scraps of evidence all serve to strengthen\r\nthe impression, derived from other sources, of slave-labour as the\r\nbackbone of Attic agriculture in this period. To free labour there are\r\nvery few references, and none of these seem to have any connexion with\r\nagriculture. This does not prove that no hired freemen were employed\r\non farms. For special jobs, as we shall see later, they were called in:\r\nbut this was only temporary employment. The μισθτοὶ or θῆτες were a\r\ndespised[373] class: some of them were freedmen. The competition with\r\nslave-labour doubtless had something to do with this, and to be driven\r\nby necessity to such labour was galling to a citizen, as we have already\r\nlearnt from Xenophon.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII. ARISTOTLE.\r\n\r\nThe great founder of the philosophy of experience is a witness[374] of\r\nexceptional value. He collected and recorded the facts and traditions\r\nof the past, judging them from the point of view of his own day.\r\nStimulated by the theories of his master Plato, he also strove, by\r\nsketching the fabric of a model state, to indicate the lines on which\r\nGreek political development might be conducted with advantage. Inasmuch\r\nas ideal circumstances were rather to be desired than expected, he\r\ndid not restrict his interest in the future to the mere designing\r\nof an ideal: taking states as he found them, conditioned by their\r\nsituation and past history, he sought for the causes of their growth and\r\ndecay, and aimed at discovering cures for their various maladies. But\r\nthroughout, whether looking to the past or the future, he was guided by\r\na characteristic moral purpose. For him ‘good living’ (τὸ εὖ ζῆν) is the\r\naim and object of political institutions. It is in the state that man\r\nfinds the possibility of reaching his full development: for he is by\r\nnature a ‘political animal.’ That is, he cannot live alone. Each step in\r\nassociation (household, village,) brings him nearer to that final union\r\nof the city. In this he attains the highest degree of manhood of which\r\nhe (as Man, differentiated from other animals by reason and speech,) is\r\ncapable. This completion of his potentialities is the proof of his true\r\nnature; that he realizes his best self in the πόλις shews that he is a\r\nπολιτικὸν ζῷον. The animal needs met in the more primitive associations\r\nare of course met in the city also. But there is something more, and this\r\nsomething more is a moral element, from which is derived the possibility\r\nof ‘good living,’ as contrasted with existence of a more predominantly\r\nanimal character. Therefore, though in point of time the man comes before\r\nthe state, in logical order the state comes first: for the man can only\r\nexist in the fulness of his nature when he is a citizen. He is by the law\r\nof his nature part of a state, potentially: as such a part he is to be\r\nregarded. As states vary, so do the several types of citizens. In the\r\nbest state the qualities of good man and good citizen are identical and\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nThe aim of political science (πολιτική) is to frame and employ the\r\nmachinery of states so as to promote the perfection of human excellence\r\n(ἀρετή), and to train the citizens on such principles as will insure\r\nthe effective working and permanence of their institutions. We may call\r\nit Aristotle’s response to the Greek yearning after a stability which\r\nwas in practice never attained. To design a model state was one way\r\nof approaching the problem. But Aristotle was surely not the man to\r\nbelieve that such an ideal could be practically realised. To make the\r\nbest of existing systems was a more promising enterprise. Now in either\r\nprocedure it was evident that material equipment[375] could not be left\r\nout of account. Without food clothing and shelter men cannot live at\r\nall, and therefore cannot live well. Experience also shewed that the\r\nmeans of defence against enemies could not safely be neglected. It is\r\nunder the head of equipment (χορηγία) that we get the philosopher’s\r\nview of the proper position of agriculture in the life of a state. We\r\nmust bear in mind the general Greek conception of citizenship common to\r\nstatesmen and theorists, present to Plato and Aristotle no less than to\r\nCleisthenes or Pericles. Residence gave no claim to it. Either it was\r\nhereditary, passing from father to son on proof of citizen descent and\r\ncertain religious qualifications; or it was deliberately conferred on a\r\nperson or persons as a privilege. That beside the citizens there should\r\nbe resident within the state[376] a number of persons, not citizens or\r\nlikely to become citizens, was a necessity generally admitted. They\r\nmight be free aliens, more or less legally connected with the state, or\r\nslaves public or private. These alien persons were very numerous in some\r\nstates, such as Athens or Corinth. Subject or serf populations of Greek\r\norigin, as in Laconia or Thessaly, are not to be distinguished from them\r\nfor the present purpose. One common mark of citizenship was the right of\r\nowning land within the territory of the state. We know that the Attic\r\nlandowner must be an Athenian citizen, and such was the general rule.\r\nWho did the actual work of cultivation, or tended the flocks and herds,\r\nis another question. We have seen reason for believing that personal\r\nlabour[377] of the owner on his farm had at one time been usual, and that\r\nthe practice still in the fourth century BC prevailed in those parts\r\nof Greece where there had been little development of urban life. And\r\nthat slave-labour was employed by farmers on a greater or less scale,\r\naccording to the size of their estates, seems as certain as certain\r\ncan be. In Attica the slave overseer, entrusted with the direction of\r\na gang of slave labourers, had become[378] a well-recognized figure,\r\nand farming by deputy, as well as labouring by deputy, was an ordinary\r\nthing. Citizens resided in the city more than ever. Rich men visited\r\ntheir country estates to keep an eye on their overseers, or paid the\r\npenalty of their neglect. Poor citizens, resident and able to attend\r\nmeetings of the Assembly, had to be kept quiet by systematic provision\r\nof fees for performance of civic functions. It may be too strong to say\r\nthat squeezing the wealthy was the leading fact of politics: but there\r\nwas too much of that sort of thing, and the scramble for state pay was\r\ndemoralizing. Immediate personal interest tended to deaden patriotism in\r\na state that within human memory had, whatever its faults, been the most\r\npublic-spirited community among the leading states of Greece.\r\n\r\nIn treating of politics, and therewith in assigning a position to\r\nagriculture, Aristotle was affected by three main influences. First,\r\nthe historical; the experience of Greek states, and more particularly\r\nof Athens. Secondly, the theoretical; the various attempts of earlier\r\nphilosophers, particularly of Plato, to find a solution of political\r\nproblems on speculative lines. Thirdly, his own firm conviction that\r\nthe lasting success of state life depended on devotion to a moral end.\r\nIt will be the simplest and best plan to consider his utterances on\r\nagriculture from these three points of view.\r\n\r\nThe supply of food being the first of necessities, and being in fact\r\n(as we have seen) an ever-pressing problem in Greece, it is no wonder\r\nthat land-hunger, leading to wars for territory, and land-grabbing,\r\na fertile cause of internal dissension and seditions in states, were\r\nnormal phenomena of Greek history. And what happened in old Hellas was\r\nreproduced abroad, as the Greek colonists overflowed into lands beyond\r\nthe seas. Once the possession of territory was secured by war, and the\r\nmeans of its defence organized, two problems soon presented themselves\r\nfor solution. It was at once necessary to decide by what labour the land\r\nwas to be cultivated. Greek colonists, desirous no doubt of an easier\r\nlife than they had led in the old country, generally contrived to devolve\r\nthis labour upon others at a very early stage of their establishment.\r\nEither they reduced natives to the condition of serfs, or they employed\r\nslaves, whom the profits of growing trade and commerce enabled them to\r\nprocure in larger and larger numbers. Meanwhile in the mother country\r\nvarious systems went on side by side. There were large districts of\r\nagricultural serfage, in which a race of conquerors were supported by the\r\nlabour of the conquered. In other parts independent peoples, backward in\r\ncivilization, lived a free rustic life of a largely pastoral character.\r\nOthers again devoted themselves more to the tillage of the soil, with\r\nor without the help of slaves. It was known that in earlier times a\r\npopulation of this kind in Attica had long existed, and that after the\r\nunification of Attica and the reforms of Solon it had for a time been the\r\nbackbone of the Athenian state. But in fertile lowland districts there\r\nwas a not unnatural tendency towards larger estates, worked by hireling\r\nor slave-labour. It seems fairly certain that in Attica before the time\r\nof Aristotle the supply of free wage-earners for farm-work was failing:\r\nthe development of the city and the Peiraeus, and the growing number of\r\nthose in receipt of civil and military pay, had drawn the poor citizen\r\naway from rustic labour. Nor is there reason to think that after the loss\r\nof empire there was any marked movement back to the land on the part of\r\nfree labourers or even small farmers. It would rather seem that Attic\r\nland was passing into fewer hands, and that the employment of stewards or\r\noverseers, free or slave, was one of the features of a change by which\r\nthe farming of land was becoming a symptom of considerable wealth.\r\n\r\nBut beside the decision as to labour there was the question as to a means\r\nof checking land-monopoly. Such monopoly, resulting in the formation\r\nof a discontented urban mob, was a serious menace to the stability of\r\na constitution. For all poor citizens to get a living by handicrafts\r\nwas perhaps hardly possible; nor would the life of an artisan suit the\r\ntastes and wishes of all. Nature does (or seems to do) more for the\r\nfarmer on his holding than for the artisan in his workshop, and the\r\nclaim to a share of the land within the boundaries of their states had\r\nled to seditions and revolutions, ruinous and bloody, followed by ill\r\nfeeling, and ever liable to recur. Colonial states, in which the first\r\nsettlers usually allotted the land (or most of it) among themselves\r\nand handed down their allotments to their children, were particularly\r\nexposed to troubles of this kind. The various fortunes of families, and\r\nthe coming of new settlers, early raised the land-question there in an\r\nacute form, as notoriously at Syracuse. No wonder that practical and\r\ntheoretical statesmen tried to find remedies for a manifest political\r\nevil. Stability was only to be assured by internal peace. To this end two\r\nmain lines of policy[379] found favour. Security of tenure was promoted\r\nby forbidding the sale of land-lots or making it difficult to encumber\r\nthem by mortgages: while the prohibition of excessive acquisition[380]\r\nwas a means of checking land-grabbers and interesting a larger number of\r\ncitizens in the maintenance of the land-system. But there is no reason\r\nto think that measures of this kind had much success. Nor were vague\r\ntraditions[381] of the equality of original land-lots in some Greek\r\nstates of any great importance. Some theoretical reformers might aim\r\nat such an arrangement, but it was a vain aspiration. Indeed, regarded\r\nfrom the food-producing point of view, nothing like a true equality was\r\npossible in practice. Confiscation and redistribution were only to be\r\neffected at the cost of civil war, and the revered wisdom of Solon[382]\r\nhad rejected such a proceeding. Communistic schemes had little attraction\r\nfor the average Greek, so far as his own labour or interests might be\r\ninvolved: even the dream of Plato was far from a thoroughgoing communism.\r\n\r\nOf the farmer in his character of citizen[383] Aristotle had a favourable\r\nimpression formed from the experience of the past. The restless activity\r\nof Assemblies frequently meeting, and with fees for attendance, was both\r\na cause and an effect of the degeneration of democracies in his day. It\r\nmeant that political issues were now at the mercy of the ignorant and\r\nfickle city-dwellers, a rabble swayed by the flattery of self-seeking\r\ndemagogues. Athens was the notable instance. Yet tradition alleged (and\r\nit can hardly be doubted) that in earlier times, when a larger part of\r\nthe civic body lived and worked in the country, a soberer and steadier\r\npolicy[384] prevailed. The farmers, never free from responsibilities and\r\ncares, were opposed to frequent Assemblies, to attend which involved\r\nno small sacrifice of valuable time. For this sacrifice a small fee\r\nwould have been no adequate compensation, and in fact they had none\r\nat all. Naturally enough Aristotle, admitting[385] that in the states\r\nof his day democratic governments were mostly inevitable, insists on\r\nthe merits of the farmer-democracies of the good old times, and would\r\nwelcome their revival. But the day for this was gone by, never to return.\r\nAnother important point arises in connexion with the capacity of the\r\nstate for war, a point seldom overlooked in Greek political speculation.\r\nIn discussing the several classes out of which the state is made up,\r\nAristotle observes[386] that individuals may and will unite in their\r\nown persons the qualifications of more than one class. So the same\r\nindividuals may perform various functions: but this does not affect his\r\nargument, for the same persons may be, and often are, both hoplites and\r\ncultivators, who yet are functionally distinct parts of the state. Just\r\nbelow, speaking of the necessity of ‘virtue’ (ἀρετὴ) for the discharge of\r\ncertain public duties (deliberative and judicial), he adds ‘The other\r\nfaculties may exist combined in many separate individuals; for instance,\r\nthe same man may be a soldier a cultivator and a craftsman, or even a\r\ncounsellor of state or a judge; but all men claim to possess virtue, and\r\nthink they are qualified to hold most offices. But the same men cannot be\r\nat once rich and poor. The common view therefore is that Rich and Poor\r\nare the true _parts_ of a state.’ That is to say, practical analysis can\r\ngo no further. In another passage[387], discussing the formation of the\r\nbest kind of democracy, he says ‘for the best Demos is that of farmers\r\n(ὁ γεωργικός): so it is possible to form (a corresponding?) democracy\r\nwhere the mass of the citizens gets its living from tillage or pasturage\r\n(ἀπὸ γεωργίας ἢ νομῆς).’ After considering the political merits of the\r\ncultivators, busy and moderate men, he goes[388] on ‘And after the Demos\r\nof cultivators the next best is that where the citizens are graziers\r\n(νομεῖς) and get their living from flocks and herds (βοσκημάτων): for\r\nthe life in many respects resembles that of the tillers of the soil,\r\nand for the purposes of military campaigning these men are peculiarly\r\nhardened[389] by training, fit for active service, and able to rough\r\nit in the open.’ The adaptability of the rustic worker is further\r\nadmitted[390] in a remark let fall in a part of his treatise where he is\r\nengaged in designing a model state. It is to the effect that, so long as\r\nthe state has a plentiful supply of farm-labourers, it must also have\r\nplenty of seamen (ναυτῶν). Having just admitted that a certain amount\r\nof maritime commerce will be necessary, and also a certain naval power,\r\nhe is touching on the manning of the fleet. The marine soldiers will\r\nbe freemen, but the seamen (oarsmen) can be taken from unfree classes\r\nworking on the land. Their social status does not at this stage concern\r\nus: that such labourers could readily be made into effective oarsmen is\r\nan admission to be noted. To the philosopher himself it is a comfort\r\nto believe that he has found out a way of doing without the turbulent\r\n‘seafaring rabble’ (ναυτικὸς ὄχλος) that usually throngs seaport towns\r\nand embarrasses orderly governments. In other words, it is a relief to\r\nfind that in a model state touching the sea it will not be necessary to\r\nreproduce the Peiraeus.\r\n\r\nIn considering the proposals of earlier theorists for the remedy of\r\npolitical defects it is hardly possible and nowise needful to exhaust all\r\nthe indications of dissatisfaction with existing systems. Of Euripides\r\nand Socrates, the two great questioners, enough has been said above. The\r\nreactionary Isocrates was for many years a contemporary of Aristotle.\r\nWhat we can no longer reproduce is the talk of active-minded critics\r\nin the social circles of Athens. It happens that Xenophon has left us a\r\nsketch of the ordinary conversations of Socrates. No doubt these were\r\nthe most important examples of their kind, and his method a powerful, if\r\nsometimes irritating, stimulus to thought. But we are not to assume a\r\nlack of other questioners, acute and even sincere, more especially among\r\nmen of oligarchic leanings. That Aristotle came into touch with such\r\npersons is probable from his connexion with Plato. Certain passages in\r\nthe _Constitution of Athens_, in which he is reasonably suspected[391]\r\nof giving a partisan view of historical events, point to the same\r\nconclusion. We shall never know all the criticisms and suggestions of\r\nothers that this watchful collector heard and noted. But it is both\r\npossible and desirable to recall those to which his own record proves him\r\nto have paid attention.\r\n\r\nBoth Hippodamus and Plato based their schemes on a class-system, in which\r\nthe farmer-class form a distinct body: but the former made them citizens\r\nwith voting rights. Being unarmed, and so at the mercy of the military\r\nclass, Aristotle held that their political rights were nugatory. In\r\nthe _Republic_, Plato gave them no voice in state-affairs, but in the\r\n_Laws_ he admitted them to the franchise. While these two reformers made\r\nprovision for a military force, Phaleas, ignoring relations with other\r\nstates, made none. To Phaleas, equality in landed estate seemed the best\r\nmeans of promoting harmony and wellbeing in the community; and he would\r\neffect this equality by legal restrictions. This proposition Aristotle\r\nrejected as neither adequate nor suited to its purpose. Moral[392]\r\ninfluences, hard work, discretion, even intellectual activity, can alone\r\nproduce the temper of moderation that promotes concord and happiness. In\r\nshort, if you are to effect any real improvement, you must start from\r\nthe doctrine of the Mean[393] and not trust to material equalizing. The\r\nseveral tenure of land-lots was generally recognized, with variations\r\nin detail; Plato in the _Laws_ abandoned the impracticable land-system\r\nof the _Republic_, and not only assigned a κλῆρος to each citizen\r\nhousehold, but arranged it in two[394] sections, for reasons given above.\r\nThe attempt to ensure the permanence of the number of land-lots and\r\nhouseholds by strict legal regulation, as some legislators had tried to\r\ndo, is also a general feature of these speculations. Plato in the _Laws_\r\neven went further, and would place rigid restrictions on acquisition of\r\nproperty of all kinds. All agree in the usual Greek contempt for those\r\nengaged in manual or sedentary trades. Such ‘mechanical’ (βάναυσοι)\r\nworkers were held to be debased in both body and mind below the standard\r\nof ‘virtue’ required of the good soldier or citizen. Phaleas made these\r\n‘artisans’ public slaves _de iure_: Hippodamus placed them, with the\r\nfarmers, in nominal citizenship but _de facto_ bondage. Plato tolerates\r\nthem because he cannot do without them. In the matter of hard bodily\r\nlabour, free or slave, the position of Plato is clear. He would devolve\r\nit upon slaves; in agriculture, with a coexisting alternative system\r\nof serf-tenants. But both classes are to be Barbarians. It seems that\r\nHippodamus meant the public, if not the private, land of his model\r\nstate to be worked by slaves. Most striking is the fact that Plato in\r\nhis later years combined the aim of self-sufficiency with dependence on\r\nservile labour. Commerce is, for the moral health of the state, to be\r\nstrictly limited. The supply of necessary food-stuffs is to be a domestic\r\nindustry, carried on by alien serfs or slaves for the most part. Such\r\ncommunism as exists among the Guardians in the _Republic_ is a communism\r\nof consumers who take no part in material production: and it is abandoned\r\nin the _Laws_.\r\n\r\nThe above outlines must suffice as a sketch of the situation both in\r\npractice and in theory when Aristotle took the matter in hand. The\r\nworking defects of Greek constitutions were obvious to many, and the\r\nincapacity of the ignorant masses in democracies was especially evident\r\nto thoughtful but irresponsible critics. Yet the selfishness of the\r\nrich in oligarchies was not ignored, and the instability of governments\r\nsupported by only a minority of the citizens was an indisputable fact.\r\nThe mass of citizens (that is, full members of the state according to the\r\nqualification-rules in force) had to come in somewhere, to give numerical\r\nstrength to a government. How was governing capacity to be placed in\r\npower under such conditions? Experience suggested that things had been\r\nbetter for Athens when a larger part of her citizens lived on the land.\r\nUse could no doubt be made of this experience in case an opening for\r\nincreasing the number of peasant farmers[395] should occur. But it was\r\nprecisely in states where such a policy was most needed that an opening\r\nwas least likely to occur. It would seem then that the only chance of\r\nimproving government lay in persuading the average citizen to entrust\r\nwider powers to a specially selected body of competent men, in short to\r\ncarry into politics the specializing principle[396] already developed by\r\nthe advance of civilization in other departments. Now the average citizen\r\nwas certain to test the plans of reformers by considering how their\r\noperation would affect cases like his own. It was therefore necessary\r\nto offer him a reassuring picture of projects of this kind, if they\r\nwere to receive any hearing at all. To own a plot of land, inalienable\r\nand hereditary, was a security against indigence. To have the labour of\r\ncultivating it performed as a matter of course by others was a welcome\r\ncorollary. To be relieved of mechanical drudgery by aliens and slaves\r\nwas a proposal sure to conciliate Greek pride. And the resulting leisure\r\nfor the enlightened discharge of the peculiarly civic functions of war\r\nand government was an appeal to self-esteem and ambition. But that the\r\ncreation of a ruling class of Guardians with absolute power, such as\r\nthose of Plato’s _Republic_, would commend itself to democratic Greeks,\r\nwas more than any practical man could believe. Nor would the communism\r\nof those Guardians appear attractive to the favourers of oligarchy.\r\nTherefore Plato himself had to recast his scheme, and try to bring it\r\nout of dreamland by concessions to facts of Greek life. Not much was\r\ngained thereby, and the great difficulty, how to make a start, still\r\nremained. That much could be done by direct legislative action was a\r\ntradition in Greek thought fostered by tales of the achievements of early\r\nlawgivers. But to remodel the whole fabric of a state so thoroughly that\r\nan entire change should be effected in the political atmosphere in which\r\nthe citizens must live and act, while the citizens themselves would be\r\nthe same persons, reared in old conditions and ideas, was a project far\r\nbeyond the scope of ordinary legislation. To Aristotle it seemed that the\r\nproblem must be approached differently.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to discuss the two distinct lines taken by him;\r\nfirst, that the character of the state depends on that of its members,\r\nand secondly, that the individual only finds his true self as member of\r\na state. The subject has been fully[397] treated, better than I could\r\ntreat it; and in constructing a model there remains the inevitable\r\ndifficulty, where to begin. The highest development of the individual\r\nis only attainable under the training provided by the model state, and\r\nthis state is only possible as an association of model citizens. If we\r\nmay conjecture Aristotle’s answer from a rule[398] laid down in the\r\n_Ethics_, he would say ‘first learn by doing, and then you can do what\r\nyou have learnt to do.’ That is, effort (at first imperfect) will improve\r\nfaculty, and by creating habit will develope full capacity. But even so\r\nit would remain uncertain whether the individual, starting on a career of\r\nself-improvement, is to work up to the making of a model state, or the\r\nimperfect state to start training its present citizens to perfection.\r\nThe practical difficulty is there still. Nor is it removed by putting\r\nthe first beginnings of training so early[399] that they even precede\r\nthe infant citizen’s birth, in the form of rules for eugenic breeding.\r\nAristotle’s procedure is to postulate favourable equipment, geographical\r\nand climatic, a population of high qualities (that is, Greek,) and then\r\nto consider how he would organize the state and train its members—if the\r\npostulated conditions were realized and he had a free hand. In this new\r\nUtopia it is most significant to observe what he adopts from historical\r\nexperience and the proposals of earlier theorists, and in what respects\r\nhe departs from them. It is in particular his attitude towards ownership\r\nand tillage of land, and labour in general, that is our present concern.\r\n\r\nAs it follows from his doctrine of the Mean that the virtue of the state\r\nand its several members must be based on the avoidance of extremes, so it\r\nfollows[400] from the moral aim of the state that its component elements\r\nare not all ‘parts’ of the state in the same strict sense. Economically,\r\nthose who provide food clothing etc are parts, necessary to the existence\r\nof the community. Politically (for politics have a moral end) they are\r\nbelow the standard of excellence required for a share in the government\r\nof a perfect state. They cannot have the leisure or the training to fit\r\nthem for so responsible a charge. Therefore they cannot be citizens. To\r\nmaintain secure independence and internal order the citizens, and the\r\ncitizens only, must bear arms. And, since the land must belong to the\r\npossessors of arms, none but citizens can own land. This does not imply\r\ncommunism. There will have to be public[401] land, from the produce of\r\nwhich provision will be made for the service of religion and for the\r\ncommon tables at which citizens will mess. To maintain these last by\r\nindividual contributions would be burdensome to the poor and tend to\r\nexclude them. For rich and poor there will be. But the evil of extreme\r\npoverty will be avoided. There will be private land, out of which each\r\ncitizen (that is evidently each citizen-household) will have an allotment\r\nof land. This κλῆρος will be in two[402] parcels, one near the city\r\nand the other near the state-frontier, so that issues of peace and war\r\nmay not be affected by the bias of local interests. The cultivation of\r\nthese allotments will be the work of subjects, either inhabitants of\r\nthe district (περίοικοι) or slaves; in any case aliens, not Greeks; and\r\nin the case of slaves care must be taken not to employ too many of the\r\nsame race together or such as are high-spirited. He is concerned to\r\nsecure the greatest efficiency and to leave the least possible facilities\r\nfor rebellion. The labourers will belong to the state or to individual\r\ncitizens according to the proprietorship of the land on which they\r\nare severally employed. By these arrangements he has provided for the\r\nsustenance of those who in the true political sense are ‘parts’ of the\r\nstate (πόλις), and for their enjoyment of sufficient leisure[403] to\r\nenable them to conduct its government in the paths of virtue and promote\r\nthe good life (τὸ εὖ ζῆν) which is the final cause of state existence.\r\n\r\nThe citizens then have the arms and the land and all political power.\r\nAmong themselves they are on an equal footing, only divided functionally\r\naccording to age: deliberative and judicial duties belonging to the elder\r\nmen, military activities to the younger. It is impossible to overlook\r\nthe influence of the Spartan system on the speculations of Aristotle as\r\nwell as those of Plato. The equality of Spartan citizens was regarded\r\nas evidence[404] of a democratic element in their constitution, and we\r\nfind this same theoretical equality among the full citizens at any given\r\nmoment in the developing constitution of Rome. It is significant that\r\nAristotle felt the necessity of such an equality. He remarks[405] that\r\nthe permanence of a constitution depends on the will of the possessors\r\nof arms. We may observe that he seldom refers to the mercenaries so\r\ncommonly employed in his day, save as his bodyguard of usurping tyrants.\r\nBut in one passage[406] he speaks of oligarchies being driven to employ\r\nthem at a pinch for their own security against the Demos, and of their\r\nown overthrow in consequence. Therefore he did not ignore the risk run\r\nby relying on hirelings: naturally he would prefer to keep the military\r\nservice of his model state in the hands of his model citizens. But he\r\nhad no belief[407] in the blind devotion of Sparta to mere preparation\r\nfor warfare. Peace is the end of war, not war of peace. If you do not\r\nlearn to make a proper use of peace, in the long run you will fail in war\r\nalso: hence the attainment of empire was the ruin of Sparta: she had not\r\ndeveloped the moral qualities needed for ruling in time of peace. But in\r\nhis model state he seems not to make adequate provision for the numbers\r\nrequired in war. His agricultural labourers are not to be employed in\r\nwarfare, as the Laconian Helots regularly were. He only admits them to\r\nthe service of the oar, controlled by the presence of marine soldiers,\r\nwho are free citizens like the poorer class of Athenians who generally\r\nserved in that capacity. The servile character of rustic labour on his\r\nplan is thus reasserted, and with it the superior standing of land forces\r\nas compared with maritime. The days were past when Athenians readily\r\nserved at the oar in their own triremes, cruising among the subject\r\nstates and certain of an obsequious reception in every port. Hired\r\nrowers had always been employed to some extent, even by Athens: in this\r\nlater period the motive power of war-gallies of naval states was more\r\nand more obtained from slaves. There was an economic analogy between\r\nfarm-labour and oar-labour. The slave was forced to toil for practically\r\nno more[408] than his food: the profits of the farm and the profits of\r\nwar-booty fell to be shared in either case by few.\r\n\r\nAristotle, who was well aware of the merits of the working farmer, the\r\npeasant citizen, and recognized that such men had been a sound and\r\nstable element in the Athens of former days, would surely not have\r\ntreated agriculture as a work reserved for servile hands, had he not been\r\nconvinced that the old rural economy was gone and could never be revived.\r\nFor, if suggestions from Sparta influenced him when designing Utopian\r\ninstitutions, it is no less clear that the Utopian setting—territory,\r\ncity, port-town,—are merely modifications of Attica, Athens, Peiraeus. In\r\nGreece there was no state so favoured geographically, so well equipped\r\nby nature for independence prosperity and power. If a Greek community\r\nwas ever to realize an artistic ideal, and live in peaceful and secure\r\nmoderation a model life of dignity and virtue, it could hardly have a\r\nbetter chance of success than in some such advantageous position as that\r\nenjoyed by Athens. Her defects lay in her institutions, such as he viewed\r\nthem at their present stage of development. These could not be approved\r\nas they stood: they needed both political and economic reform. Into the\r\nformer we need not enter here: the later democracy could not but disgust\r\none who judged merit from the standpoint of his doctrine of the Mean.\r\nEconomically, we may infer from his own model project that two great\r\nchanges would be required. Citizens must all have an interest in the\r\nland, though farmed by slave labour. The port-town must no longer be a\r\ncentre of promiscuous commerce, thronged with a cosmopolitan population\r\nof merchants seamen dock-labourers etc and the various purveyors who\r\ncatered for their various appetites. In truth the Peiraeus was a\r\nstumbling-block to him as to Plato, and probably to most men[409] who did\r\nnot themselves draw income from its trade or its iniquities, or who did\r\nnot derive political power from the support of its democratic citizens.\r\nTo have a state ‘self-sufficing’ so far as to get its necessary food from\r\nits own territory, and to limit commerce to a moderate traffic sufficient\r\nto procure by exchange such things as the citizens wanted but could not\r\nproduce (for instance[410] timber), was a philosopher’s aspiration.\r\n\r\nWhile proposing to restrict commercial activity as being injurious in\r\nits effect, when carried to excess, on the higher life of the state,\r\nAristotle like Plato admits[411] that not only slaves but free aliens,\r\npermanently or temporarily resident, must form a good part of the\r\npopulation. He does not even[412] like Plato propose to fix a limit to\r\nthe permissible term of metic residence. Apparently he would let the\r\nresident alien make his fortune in Utopia and go on living there as a\r\nnon-citizen of means. But he would not allow him to hold real property\r\nwithin the state, as Xenophon or some other[413] writer had suggested.\r\nThat the services of aliens other than slaves were required for the\r\nwellbeing of the state, is an important admission. For it surely implies\r\nthat there were departments of trade and industry in which slave-labour\r\nalone was felt to be untrustworthy, while the model citizens of a\r\nmodel state could not properly be so employed. The power of personal\r\ninterest[414] in promoting efficiency and avoiding waste is an elementary\r\nfact not forgotten by Aristotle. Now the slave, having no personal\r\ninterest involved beyond escaping punishment, is apt to be a shirker and\r\na waster. The science of the master (δεσποτική)[415], we are told, is the\r\nscience of using slaves; that is, of getting out of them what can be got.\r\nIt is a science of no great scope or dignity. Hence busy masters employ\r\noverseers. He suggests that some stimulus to exertion may be found in\r\nthe prospect of manumission[416] for good service. This occurs again in\r\nthe _Economics_, but the question of what is to become of the worn-out\r\nrustic slave is not answered by him[417] any more than it is by Plato. My\r\nbelief is that, so far as farm staffs are concerned, he has chiefly if\r\nnot wholly in view cases[418] of stewards overseers etc. These would be\r\nin positions of some trust, perhaps occasionally filled by freemen, and\r\nto create in them some feeling of personal interest would be well worth\r\nthe masters while. Domestic slavery was on a very different footing, but\r\nit too was often a worry[419] to masters. Here manumission played an\r\nobvious and important part, and perhaps still more in the clerical staffs\r\nof establishments for banking and other businesses. These phenomena of\r\nAthenian life were interesting and suggestive. Yet Aristotle is even\r\nmore reticent[420] than Plato (and with less reason) on the subject of\r\nmanumission: which is matter for regret.\r\n\r\nThe model state then will contain plenty of free aliens, serving the\r\nstate with their talents and labour, an urban non-landholding element.\r\nThey set the model citizens free for the duties of politics and war.\r\nWhether they will be bound to service in the army or the fleet, like the\r\nAthenian metics, we are not told. Nor is it easy to guess how Aristotle\r\nwould have answered the question. Their main function is to carry on the\r\nvarious meaner or ‘mechanical’ trades and occupations, no doubt employing\r\nor not employing the help of slaves according to circumstances. All such\r\ntrades were held to have a degrading effect[421] on both body and mind,\r\ndisabling those practising them from attaining the highest excellence,\r\nthat is the standard of model citizens in war and peace. Aristotle finds\r\nthe essence of this taint in transgression of the doctrine of the Mean.\r\nSpecialization carried to extremes produces professionalism which, for\r\nthe sake of perfecting technical skill, sacrifices the adaptability, the\r\nbodily suppleness and strength and the mental all-round alertness and\r\nserene balance,—qualities which every intelligent Greek admired, and\r\nwhich Aristotle postulated in the citizens of his model community. So\r\nstrong is his feeling on the point that it comes[422] out in connexion\r\nwith music. The young citizens are most certainly to have musical\r\ntraining, but they are not to become professional performers; for this\r\nsort of technical excellence is nothing but a form of βαναυσία.\r\n\r\nIf neither the farmer nor the artisan are to be citizens, and the\r\ndisqualification of the latter rests on his narrow professionalism, we\r\nare tempted to inquire whether the claim of the farmer may not also\r\nhave been regarded as tainted by the same disability. That agriculture\r\nafforded scope for a high degree of technical skill is a fact not missed\r\nby Aristotle. He is at pains to point out[423] that this most fundamental\r\nof industries is a source of profit if scientifically pursued, as well\r\nas a means of bare subsistence. For the exchange[424] of products (such\r\nas corn and wine) by barter soon arises, and offers great opportunities,\r\nwhich are only increased to an injurious extent by the invention of a\r\nmetallic currency. Now the founder of the Peripatetic school was not\r\nthe man to ignore the principles of scientific farming, and the labour\r\nof collecting details had for him no terrors. Accordingly he refers\r\nto the knowledge[425] required in several departments of pastoral and\r\nagricultural life. He sketches briefly the development of the industry,\r\nfrom the mere gathering of nature’s bounty, through the stage of nomad\r\npasturage, to settled occupation and the raising of food-crops by tillage\r\nof the soil. But in the _Politics_ he does not follow out this topic.\r\nHis preoccupation is the development of man in political life: so he\r\ndismisses further detail with the remark[426] (referring to the natural\r\nbranch of χρηματιστική, the art of profit-making, which operates with\r\ncrops and beasts) that in matters of this kind speculation is liberal\r\n(= worthy of a free man) but practice is not. This seems to imply that\r\nto be engrossed in the detailed study of various soils or breeds of\r\nbeasts, with a view to their appropriate and profitable management,\r\nis an illiberal and cramping pursuit. He does not apply to it the\r\nterm βαναυσία, and the reason probably is that the bodily defects of\r\nthe sedentary artisan are not found in the working farmer. But the\r\nconcentration upon mean details of no moral or political significance is\r\ncommon to both. That all unskilled[427] wage-earners fall under the same\r\nban is a matter of course, hardly worth mentioning. In short, all those\r\nwho depend on the custom of others for a living are subject to a sort of\r\nslavery in a greater or less degree, and unfit to be citizens.\r\n\r\nThe value attached to ‘self-sufficiency’ as evidence of freedom and of\r\nnot living ‘in relation to another’ (that is, in dependence[428] on\r\nanother,) is in striking contrast to views that have enjoyed a great\r\nvogue in modern economic theory. Neither the man nor the state can be\r\ncompletely[429] self-sufficing: that Aristotle, and Plato before him,\r\nsaw. Man, feeling his way upward through the household to the state,\r\nneeds help. He first finds[430] a helper (I am omitting the sex-union)\r\nin the ox, the forerunner of the slave, and still in primitive rustic\r\nlife the helper of the poor. Growing needs bring division of labour and\r\nexchange by barter, and so on. As a political animal he can never be\r\nquite independent as an individual, but it is the law of his being that\r\nthe expanding needs which draw him into association with his fellows\r\nresult in making him more of a man. Here lies a pitfall. If through\r\nprogress in civilization his daily life becomes so entangled with those\r\nof other men that his freedom of action is hampered thereby, surely\r\nhe has lost something. His progress has not been clear gain, and the\r\nbalance may not be easy to strike. It is therefore a problem, how to find\r\na position in which man may profit by the advantages of civilization\r\nwithout risking the loss of more than he has gained. Aristotle does not\r\nstate it in terms so brutally frank. But the problem is there, and he\r\ndoes in effect attempt a solution. The presence in sufficient numbers of\r\nslaves legally unfree, and workers legally free but virtually under a\r\ndefined or special kind[431] of servitude (ἀφωρισμένην τινὰ δουλείαν), is\r\nthe only means by which a privileged class can get all the good that is\r\nto be got out of human progress. His model citizens are an aristocracy\r\nof merited privilege, so trained to virtue that to be governed by them\r\nwill doubtless enable their subjects to enjoy as much happiness as their\r\ninferior natures can receive. This solution necessitates the maintenance\r\nof slavery[432] as existing by nature, and the adoption of economic\r\nviews that have been rightly called reactionary. The student of human\r\nnature and experience unwisely departed from the safer ground of his own\r\nprinciples and offered a solution that was no solution at all.\r\n\r\nAs the individual man cannot live in complete isolation, supplying his\r\nown needs and having no relations with other men,—for his manhood would\r\nthus remain potential and never become actual—so it will be with the\r\nstate also. It must not merely allow aliens to reside in it and serve\r\nits purposes internally: it will have to stand in some sort of relations\r\nto other states. This is sufficiently asserted by the provision made for\r\nthe contingency of war. But in considering how far a naval force would be\r\nrequired[433] in his model state he remarks ‘The scale of this force must\r\nbe determined by the part (τὸν βίον) played by our state: if it is to\r\nlead a life of leadership and have dealings with other states (ἡγεμονικὸν\r\nκαὶ πολιτικὸν βίον), it will need to have at hand this force also on a\r\nscale proportioned to its activities.’ Then, jealous ever of the Mean,\r\nhe goes on to deny the necessity of a great ‘nautical rabble,’ in fact\r\nthe nuisance of the Peiraeus referred to above. On the protection of such\r\nmaritime commerce as he would admit he does not directly insist; but,\r\nknowing Athens so well, no doubt he had it in mind. Another illustration\r\nof the virtuous Mean may be found in the rules of education. The\r\nrelations of the quarrelsome Greek states had been too often hostile. The\r\nSpartan training had been too much admired. But it was too one-sided, too\r\nmuch a glorification of brute force, and its inadequacy had been exposed\r\nsince Leuctra. Its success had been due to the fact that no other state\r\nhad specialized in preparation for war as Sparta had done. Once others\r\ntook up this war-policy in earnest, Sparta’s vantage was gone. This\r\nvantage was her all. Beaten in war, she had no reserve of non-military\r\nqualities to assuage defeat and aid a revival. The citizens of Utopia\r\nmust not be thus brutalized. Theirs must be the true man’s courage\r\n(ἀνδρία)[434], as far removed from the reckless ferocity of the robber\r\nor the savage as from cowardice. It is surely not too much to infer[435]\r\nthat military citizens of this character were meant to pursue a public\r\npolicy neither abject nor aggressive.\r\n\r\nIt is in connexion with bodily training that we come upon views that\r\nthrow much light on the position of agricultural labour. There is, he\r\nremarks, a general agreement[436] that gymnastic exercises do promote\r\nmanly courage, or as he puts it below ‘health and prowess.’ But at the\r\npresent time there is, in states where the training of the young is\r\nmade a special object, a tendency[437] to overdo it: they bring up the\r\nboys as regular athletes, producing a habit of body that hinders the\r\nshapely development and growth of the frame. The Thebans in particular\r\nare thought to be meant. His own system does not thus run to excess.\r\nGentle exercises gradually extended will develop fine bodies to match\r\nfine souls. Now his labouring classes receive no bodily training of the\r\nkind. The frame of the artisan is left to become cramped and warped by\r\nthe monotonous movements of his trade. So too the farm-labourer is left\r\nto become hard and stiff-jointed. Neither will have the supple agility\r\nneeded for fighting as an art. We have seen that this line had already\r\nbeen taken by Plato in the _Republic_; indeed it was one that a Greek\r\ncould hardly avoid. Yet the shock-tactics of heavy columns were already\r\nrevolutionizing Greek warfare as much as the light troops organized by\r\nIphicrates. Were Aristotle’s military principles not quite up to date?\r\nPhilip made the Macedonian rustic into a first-rate soldier. But the\r\nnorthern tribesman was a free man. The rustic of the model state was to\r\nbe a slave or serf: therefore he could not be a soldier. To keep him in\r\ndue subjection he must not be allowed to have arms or trained to use them\r\nskilfully. This policy is nothing more or less than the precautionary\r\ndevice[438] resorted to in Crete; the device that he twits Plato with\r\nomitting in the _Republic_, though without it his Guardians would not be\r\nable to control the landholding Husbandmen. And yet the weakness of the\r\nCretan system is duly noted[439] in its place. The truth is, Aristotle\r\nwas no more exempt from the worship of certain ill-defined political\r\nterms than were men of far less intellectual power. The democrat\r\nworshipped ‘freedom’ in the sense[440] of ‘do as you please,’ the mark of\r\na freeborn citizen. The philosopher would not accept so crude a doctrine,\r\nbut he is none the less determined to mark off the ‘free’ from the\r\nunfree, socially as well as politically. Adapting an institution known\r\nin Thessalian[441] cities, he would have two open ‘places’ (ἀγοραί) in\r\nhis model state; one for marketing and ordinary daily business, the other\r\nreserved for the free citizens. Into the latter no tradesman (βάναυσον)\r\nor husbandman (γεωργόν), or other person of like status (τοιοῦτον), is to\r\nintrude—unless the magistrates summon him to attend.\r\n\r\nIt is a pity that Aristotle has left us no estimate of the relative\r\nnumerical strength of the various classes of population in Utopia. He\r\nneglects this important detail more completely even than Plato. Yet\r\nI fancy that an attempt to frame such an estimate would very soon\r\nhave exposed the visionary and unpractical nature of the whole fabric\r\nconstructed on his lines. It would, I believe, have been ultimately\r\nwrecked on the doctrine of the Mean. Restriction of commerce had to\r\nbe reconciled with financial strength, for he saw that wealth was\r\nneeded[442] for both peace and war. This εὐπορία could only arise from\r\nsavings, the accumulated surplus of industry. The labouring classes would\r\ntherefore have to provide not only their own sustenance etc and that of\r\ntheir rulers, but a considerable surplus as well. This would probably\r\nnecessitate so numerous a labouring population that the citizens would\r\nhave enough to do in controlling them and keeping them to their work.\r\nTo increase the number of citizens would add to the unproductive[443]\r\nmouths, and so on. Foreign war would throw everything out of gear, and\r\nno hiring of mercenaries is suggested. It is the carrying to excess\r\nof the principle of specialization that demands excess of ‘leisure,’\r\nnothing less than the exemption of all citizens (all persons that count,\r\nin short,) from manual toil. Yet it was one who well knew the political\r\nmerits of peasant farmers that was the author of this extravagant scheme\r\nfor basing upon a servile agriculture the entertainment of a hothouse\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\nThe general effect produced by reviewing the evidence of Aristotle on\r\nagriculture and the labour-question is that he was a witness of the\r\ndecay of the working-farmer class, and either could not or would not\r\npropose any plan for reviving it. The rarity of the words αὐτουργὸς and\r\ncognates is not to be wondered at in his works. They do not occur in\r\nthe _Politics_. The _Rhetoric_ furnishes two[444] passages. One refers\r\nto the kinds of men especially liable to unfair treatment (ἀδικία)\r\nbecause it is not worth their while to waste time on legal proceedings,\r\nciting as instances aliens and αὐτουργοί. Rustics may be included, but\r\nare not expressly mentioned. The other[445] refers to qualities that\r\nmen generally like and respect, as justice. ‘Popular opinion finds this\r\ncharacter in those who do not make their living out of others; that is,\r\nwho live of their own labour, for instance those who live by farming\r\n(ἀπὸ γεωργίας), and, in other pursuits, those most of all who work with\r\ntheir own hands.’ Here we have the working farmer expressly cited as a\r\ntype worthy of respect. But to single him out thus certainly does not\r\nsuggest that the type was a common one. The great Aristotelian index of\r\nBonitz supplies three[446] more passages, all from the little treatise\r\n_de mundo_. They occur in a special context. God, as the cause that holds\r\ntogether the universe, is not to be conceived as a power enduring the\r\ntoil of a self-working laborious animal (αὐτουργοῦ καὶ ἐπιπόνου ζῴου).\r\nNor must we suppose that God, seated aloft in heaven and influencing\r\nall things more or less directly in proportion as they are near or far,\r\npervades and flits through the universe regardless of his dignity and\r\npropriety to carry on the things of earth with his own hands (αὐτουργεῖ\r\nτὰ ἐπὶ γῆς). The third passage is in a comparison, illustrating the\r\ndivine power by the Persian system, in which the Great King sitting on\r\nhis throne pervades and directs his vast empire through his ministering\r\nagents. Such _a fortiori_ is the government of God.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII. THE LATER ATTIC ORATORS.\r\n\r\nIt has already been remarked that no clear chronological line can be\r\ndrawn to divide this famous group into two sections, but that there\r\nis nevertheless a real distinction between the period of hostility\r\nto Persia and that in which fear of Macedon was the dominant theme.\r\nThe jealousies and disunion of the Greek states are the background of\r\nboth. Isocrates[447] had appealed in vain for Greek union as a means of\r\nrealizing Greek ambitions and satisfying Greek needs. Demosthenes, so far\r\nas he did succeed in combining Greek forces to resist the encroachments\r\nof Philip, succeeded too late. In the fifth century BC we see the Greek\r\nstates grouped under two great leading powers. The conflict of these\r\npowers leaves one of them the unquestioned head of the Greek world.\r\nThe next half century witnessed the fall of Sparta, earned by gross\r\nmisgovernment, and the rise and relapse of Thebes. In the same period\r\nAthens made another bid for maritime empire, but this second Alliance had\r\nfailed. Isolation of Greek states was now the rule, and the hopelessness\r\nof any common policy consummated the weakness of exhaustion. At Athens\r\nthe old fervent patriotism was cooling down, as we learn from the\r\ngrowing reluctance to make sacrifices in the country’s cause. Demos\r\nwas no longer imperial, and he was evidently adapting himself to a\r\nhumbler role. His political leaders had to secure his food-supply and\r\nprovide for his festivals, and this out of a sadly shrunken income. To\r\nprovide efficient fighting forces on land and sea was only possible by\r\nappropriating the Festival fund (θεωρικόν), and the mob of Athens was\r\nunwilling either to fight in person or to surrender its amusements in\r\norder to hire mercenaries. Too often the result was that mercenaries,\r\nhired but not paid, were left to pillage friend and foe alike for their\r\nown support. The truth is, individualism was superseding old-fashioned\r\npatriotism. The old simple views of life and duty had been weakened by\r\nthe questionings of many thinkers, and no new moral footing had yet\r\nbeen found to compete with immediate personal interest. Athens was the\r\nchief centre of this decline, for the intellectual and moral influences\r\npromoting it were strongest there: but it was surely not confined to\r\nAthens. The failure of Thebes after the death of Epaminondas was one of\r\nmany symptoms of decay. She had overthrown Sparta, but she could not\r\nherself lead Greece: her utmost achievement was a fatal equilibrium of\r\nweak states, of which the Macedonian was soon to take full advantage.\r\nAnd everywhere, particularly in rural districts, the flower of the male\r\npopulation was being drained away, enlisting in mercenary armies, lured\r\nby the hope of gain and willing to escape the prospect of hard and dreary\r\nlives at home. In short, each was for his own hand.\r\n\r\nSuch an age was not one to encourage the peaceful and patient toil of\r\nagriculture. The great cities, above all Athens, needed cheap corn.\r\nTheir own farmers could not supply this, and so importation[448] was\r\nby law favoured, and as far as possible inforced. Thus times of actual\r\ndearth seldom occurred, and home-grown corn was seldom a paying crop.\r\nThrown back all the more on cultivation of the olive and vine the\r\nproducts of which were available for export, the farmer needed time for\r\nthe development of his planted (πεφυτευμένη) land, and the waiting for\r\nreturns necessitated a larger capital. He was then exposed to risk of\r\ngreater damage in time of war. For his capital was irretrievably sunk\r\nin his vineyard or oliveyard, and its destruction would take years\r\nto repair—that is, more waiting and more capital. This was no novel\r\nsituation. But its effect in reducing the number of small peasant farmers\r\nwas probably now greater than ever. Not only were mercenary armies\r\nrelentless destroyers and robbers (having no fear of reprisals and no\r\nconventional scruples to restrain them), but their example corrupted the\r\npractice of citizen forces. Even if no fighting took place in this or\r\nthat neighbourhood, the local farmers[449] must expect to be ruined by\r\nthe mere presence of their own defenders. When we bear in mind the risks\r\nof drought in some parts or floods in others, the occasional losses of\r\nlive stock, and other ordinary misfortunes, it is fair to imagine that\r\nthe farmer of land needed to be a man of substance, not liable to be\r\nruined by a single blow. And the sidelights thrown on the subject by the\r\nindirect references in the orators are quite consistent with this view.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the Thracian Chersonese in the disasters of 405 BC had not\r\nonly dispossessed the Athenian settlers there, but made that region\r\na source of continual anxiety to Athens. She was no longer in secure\r\ncontrol of the strait through which the corn-ships passed from the\r\nPontus. A considerable revival of her naval power enabled her in 365 to\r\noccupy the island of Samos and to regain a footing in the Chersonese.\r\nTo both of these cleruchs were sent. But the tenure of the Chersonese\r\nwas disputed by Thracian princes, and it was necessary to send frequent\r\nexpeditions thither. The success or failure of these enterprises is\r\nrecorded in histories of Greece. The importance of the position justified\r\ngreat efforts to retain it. Greek cities on the Propontis and Bosporus,\r\nnot Thracian chiefs only, gave trouble. If short of supplies, as in 362,\r\nthey were tempted to lay hands[450] on the corn-ships, and consume what\r\nwas meant for Athens. But the result of much confused warfare was that in\r\n358 the Chersonese became once more a part of the Athenian empire. Even\r\nafter the dissolution of that empire in the war with the Allies 358-6,\r\npart of the peninsula still remained Athenian. But it was now exposed to\r\nthe menace of the growing power of Macedon under Philip. To induce the\r\nDemos, who needed the corn, to provide prompt and adequate protection\r\nfor the gate of Pontic trade, was one of the many difficult tasks of\r\nDemosthenes.\r\n\r\nDemosthenes is by far the most important witness to the circumstances\r\nof his age; though much allowance must be made for bias and partisan\r\nnecessities, this does not greatly affect references to agricultural\r\nmatters. Unfortunately his supreme reputation caused the works of other\r\nauthors to be attributed to him in later times. Thus the total number\r\nof speeches passing under his name is a good deal larger than that of\r\nthe undoubtedly genuine ones. But, if we set aside a few mere forgeries\r\nof later rhetoricians, the speeches composed by contemporary authors\r\nare no less authorities for stray details of rural life than those of\r\nDemosthenes himself. It is therefore not necessary to discuss questions\r\nof authorship, on which even the ablest specialists are often not agreed.\r\nBut it is of interest to bear in mind that we are gleaning little items,\r\nfrom a strictly Athenian point of view, bearing on the condition of\r\nthe same Athens and Attica as came under the cool observation of the\r\noutsider Aristotle. The lives of Aristotle and Demosthenes, from 384-3\r\nto 322 BC, are exactly contemporary. And, as in matters of politics the\r\nspeeches of the orators often illustrate the philosopher’s criticisms of\r\ndemocracy, so it is probable that the matters of food-supply and rural\r\neconomy, referred to by speakers for purposes of the moment, were among\r\nthe particulars noted by Aristotle when forming his conclusions on those\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nThe right of owning real estate in Attica being reserved for Athenian\r\ncitizens, aliens were debarred from what was sometimes a convenient\r\nform[451] of investment. If the possible return on capital so placed\r\nwas lower than in more speculative ventures, the risk of total loss was\r\ncertainly much less, of partial loss comparatively small. Moreover it\r\ngave the owner a certain importance[452] as a citizen of known substance.\r\nIt enabled a rich man to vary[453] his investments, as references to\r\nmixed estates shew. And he had a choice of policies in dealing with\r\nit: he could reside on his own property and superintend the management\r\nhimself, or entrust the charge to a steward, or let it to a tenant. And,\r\nif at any time he wanted ready money for some purpose, he could raise it\r\nby a mortgage on favourable terms. If the land lay in a pleasant spot\r\nnot too far from the city, he was tempted to make himself a ‘place in\r\nthe country’ for his own occasional retirement and the entertainment of\r\nfriends. That landowning presented itself to Athenians of the Demosthenic\r\nperiod in the aspects just sketched is manifest from the speeches\r\nbelonging to the years from 369 to 322 BC. Of the small working farmer\r\nthere is very little trace. But that some demand for farms existed seems\r\nindicated by the cleruchs sent to the Chersonese and Samos. No doubt\r\nthese were meant to serve as resident garrisons at important points, and\r\nit is not to be supposed that they were dependent solely on their own\r\nlabour for tillage of their lots. Another kind of land-hunger speaks for\r\nitself. The wars and wastings of this period placed large areas of land\r\nat the disposal of conquerors. Olynthian, Phocian, Boeotian territory was\r\nat one time or another confiscated and granted out as reward for this\r\nor that service. No reproaches of Demosthenes are more bitter than the\r\nreferences to these cruel and cynical measures of Philip’s corrupting\r\npolicy. Individuals shared[454] these and other spoils: the estates of\r\nAeschines and Philocrates in Phocis, and later of Aeschines in Boeotia,\r\nare held up as the shameful wages of treachery. These estates can only\r\nhave been worked by slave-labour under stewards, for politicians in\r\nAthens could not reside abroad. They are specimens of the large-scale\r\nagriculture to which the circumstances of the age were favourable.\r\n\r\nA dispute arising out of a case of challenge to exchange properties[455]\r\n(ἀντίδοσις), in order to decide which party was liable for performance\r\nof burdensome state-services, gives us a glimpse of a large holding in\r\nAttica. It belongs to 330 BC or later. The farm is an ἐσχατιά, that is\r\na holding near[456] the frontier. It is stated to have been more than\r\n40 stadia (about 5 miles) in circuit. The farmstead included granaries\r\n(οἰκήματα) for storing the barley and wheat which were evidently the\r\nchief crops on this particular farm. It included also a considerable\r\nvineyard producing a good quantity of wine. Among the by-products was\r\nbrushwood (ὕλη, not timber ξύλα)[457]. The faggots were carried to\r\nmarket (Athens, I presume) on the backs of asses. The ass-drivers are\r\nspecially mentioned. The returns from the faggot-wood are stated at over\r\n12 drachms a day. The challenging speaker declares that this estate\r\nwas wholly unencumbered: not a mortgage-post (ὅρος) was to be seen. He\r\ncontrasts his own position, a man who has lost most of his property in\r\na mining venture, though he has even toiled with his own[458] hands,\r\nwith that of the landlord (I presume not an αὐτουργός) enriched by the\r\nlate rise of the prices of corn and wine. He may be grossly exaggerating\r\nthe profits of this border-farm: his opponent would probably be able to\r\ncite very different facts from years when the yield had been poor or\r\nprices low. Still, to impress an Athenian jury, the picture drawn in\r\nthis speech must at least have seemed a possible one. The labour on the\r\nfarm would be mainly that of slaves: but to this I shall return below.\r\nIn another speech[459] we hear of a farmer in the far north, on the SE\r\nCrimean coast. The sea-carriage of 80 jars of sour wine is accounted\r\nfor by his wanting it for his farm-hands (ἐργάται). Slaves are probably\r\nmeant, but we cannot be sure of it in that slave-exporting part of the\r\nworld. At any rate he was clearly farming on a large scale. If he was,\r\nas I suppose, a Greek settler, the case is an interesting one. For it\r\nwould seem to confirm the view of Isocrates, that Greek expansion was a\r\nfeasible solution of a felt need, provided suitable territory for the\r\npurpose could be acquired; and that of Xenophon, when he proposed to\r\nplant necessitous Greeks in Asiatic lands taken from Persia.\r\n\r\nThe type of farmer known to us from Aristophanes, who works a holding\r\nof moderate size, a man not wealthy but comfortable, a well-to-do\r\npeasant proprietor who lives among the slaves whose labour he directs,\r\nis hardly referred to directly in the speeches of this period.\r\nDemosthenes[460] in 355 BC makes the general remark ‘You cannot deny\r\nthat farmers who live thrifty lives, and by reason of rearing children\r\nand domestic expenses and other public services have fallen into arrear\r\nwith their property-tax, do the state less wrong than the rogues who\r\nembezzle public funds.’ But he does not say that there were many such\r\nworthy citizen-farmers, nor does he (I think) imply it. In a similar\r\npassage[461] three years later he classes them with merchants, mining\r\nspeculators, and other men in businesses, as better citizens than the\r\ncorrupt politicians. Such references are far too indefinite, and too\r\ndependent on the rhetorical needs of the moment, to tell us much. In one\r\nof the earlier private speeches[462] Demosthenes deals with a dispute\r\nof a kind probably common. It is a neighbours’ quarrel over a wall, a\r\nwatercourse, and right of way. To all appearance the farms interested\r\nin the rights and wrongs were not large holdings. They were evidently\r\nin a hilly district. The one to protect which from floods the offending\r\nwall had been built had at one time belonged to a ‘town-bred[463] man’\r\nwho disliked the place, neglected it, and sold it to the father of\r\nDemosthenes’ client. There is nothing to shew that this farm was the\r\nwhole of the present owner’s estate: so that it is hardly possible to\r\nclassify him economically with any exactitude. We do by chance learn that\r\nhe had a staff of slaves, and that vines and fig-trees grew on the land.\r\n\r\nThe author of one of the earlier speeches[464] (between 368 and 365\r\nBC) furnishes much more detail in connexion with estates of what was\r\napparently a more ordinary type. Neighbours are quarrelling as usual,\r\nand we have of course only _ex parte_ statements. The farms, worked by\r\nslave-labour, produce vines and olives and probably some corn also. The\r\nenclosure and tending of valuable plants is represented as kept up to a\r\nhigh standard. Incidentally we learn that the staff used to contract[465]\r\nfor the gathering of fruit (ὀπώραν) or the reaping and carrying of\r\nother crops (θέρος ἐκθερίσαι), clearly on other estates. The contract\r\nwas always made by a person named, who is thereby proved to have been\r\nthe real owner of these slaves,—a point in the case. According to his\r\nown account, the speaker had for some time been settled (κατῴκουν) on\r\nthe estate. That is, he had a house there and would sometimes be in\r\nresidence. The amenities of the place are indicated by the mention of his\r\nyoung rose-garden, which was ravaged by trespassers, as were his olives\r\nand vines. The house from which they carried off ‘all the furniture,\r\nworth more than 20 minas,’ seems to have been in Athens, and the mention\r\nof the lodging-house (συνοικία) that he mortgaged for 16 minas shews that\r\nhis estate was a mixed one. Country houses were no exceptional thing. A\r\nmining speculator speaks of an opponent[466] as coming to his house in\r\nthe country and intruding into the apartments of his wife and daughters.\r\nA party protesting against being struck off the deme-register says[467]\r\nthat his enemies made a raid on his cottage in the country (οἰκίδιον ἐν\r\nἀγρῷ). He is probably depreciating the house, in order not to have the\r\ndangerous appearance of a rich man.\r\n\r\nWe hear also of farms near Athens, the suburban position of which no\r\ndoubt enhanced their value. In the large mixed estate inherited and\r\nwasted by Timarchus, =Aeschines=[468] mentions (344 BC) a farm only\r\nabout a mile and a half from the city wall. The spendthrift’s mother\r\nentreated him to keep this property at least: her wish was to be buried\r\nthere. But even this he sold, for 2000 drachms (less than £80). In the\r\nspeech against Euergus and Mnesibulus the plaintiff tells[469] how his\r\nopponents raided his farm and carried off 50 soft-wooled sheep at graze,\r\nand with them the shepherd and all the belongings of the flock, also a\r\ndomestic slave, etc. This was not enough: they pushed on into the farm\r\nand tried to capture the slaves, who fled and escaped. Then they turned\r\nto the house, broke down the door that leads to the garden (κῆπον),\r\nburst in upon his wife and children, and went off with all the furniture\r\nthat remained in the house. The speaker particularly points out[470]\r\nthat he had lived on the place from childhood, and that it was near the\r\nrace-course (πρὸς τῷ ἱπποδρόμῳ). It must then have been near Athens. The\r\ndetails given suggest that it was a fancy-farm, devoted to the production\r\nof stock valued for high quality and so commanding high prices. The\r\ngarden seems to be a feature of an establishment more elegant than that\r\nof a mere peasant farmer. It corresponds to the rose-bed in a case\r\nreferred to above: =Hyperides=[471] too mentions a man who had a κῆπος\r\nnear the Academy, doubtless a pleasant spot. The farm in the plain (ὀ ἐν\r\nπεδίῳ ἀγρός)[472] belonging to Timotheus, and mortgaged by him to meet\r\nhis debts, is only mentioned in passing (362 BC) with no details: we can\r\nonly suppose it to have been an average holding in the rich lowland.\r\n\r\nA few passages require separate consideration in connexion with the\r\nlabour-question. In the speech on the Crown (330 BC) Demosthenes\r\nquotes[473] Aeschines as protesting against being reproached with the\r\nfriendship (ξενίαν) of Alexander. He retorts ‘I am not so crazy as to\r\ncall you Philip’s ξένος or Alexander’s φίλος, unless one is to speak\r\nof reapers or other wage-earners as the friends of those who hire them\r\n... but on a former occasion I called you the hireling (μισθωτὸν) of\r\nPhilip, and I now call you the hireling of Alexander.’ Here the reaper\r\n(θεριστής) is contemptuously referred to as a mere hireling. Such was\r\nthe common attitude towards poor freemen who lived by wage-earning\r\nlabour,—θῆτες in short. But is it clear that the μισθωτὸς is necessarily\r\na freeman? The passage cited above from an earlier speech makes it\r\ndoubtful. If a gang of slaves could contract to cut and carry a crop\r\n(θέρος μισθοῖντο ἐκθερίσαι), their owner acting for them, surely they\r\nwere strictly μισθωτοὶ from the point of view of the farmer who hired\r\nthem. They were ἀνδράποδα μισθοφοροῦντα, to use the exact Greek phrase.\r\nIn the speech against Timotheus an even more notable passage[474] (362\r\nBC) occurs. Speaking of some copper said to have been taken in pledge for\r\na debt, the speaker asks ‘Who were the persons that brought the copper to\r\nmy father’s house? Were they hired men (μισθωτοί), or slaves (οἰκέται)?’\r\nHere, at first sight, we seem to have the hireling clearly marked off\r\nas free. For the argument[475] proceeds ‘or which of my slave-household\r\n(τῶν οἰκετῶν τῶν ἐμῶν) took delivery of the copper? If slaves brought\r\nit, then the defendant ought to have handed them over (for torture): if\r\nhired men, he should have demanded our slave who received and weighed\r\nit.’ Strictly speaking, slaves, in status δοῦλοι, are οἰκέται[476] in\r\nrelation to their owner, of whose οἰκία they form a part. But if _A_ in a\r\ntransaction with _B_ employed some slaves whom he hired for the purpose\r\nfrom _C_ (_C_ being in no way personally involved in the case), would not\r\nthese[477] be μισθωτοί, in the sense that they were not his own οἰκέται,\r\nbut procured by μισθὸς for the job? It is perhaps safer to assume that in\r\nthe case before us the hirelings meant by the speaker are freemen, but I\r\ndo not think it can be considered certain. Does not their exemption from\r\nliability to torture prove it? I think not, unless we are to assume that\r\nthe slaves hired from a third person, not a party in the case, could be\r\nlegally put to question. That this was so, I can find no evidence, nor\r\nis it probable. The regular practice was this: either a party offered\r\nhis slaves for examination under torture, or he did not. If he did not,\r\na challenge (πρόκλησις) was addressed to him by his opponent, demanding\r\ntheir surrender for the purpose. But to demand the slaves of any owner,\r\nnot a party in the case, was a very different thing, and I cannot\r\ndiscover the existence of any such right. I am not speaking of state\r\ntrials, in which the claims of the public safety might override private\r\ninterests, but of private cases, in which the issue lay between clearly\r\ndefined adversaries. In default of direct and unquestionable authority,\r\nI cannot suppose that an Athenian slaveowner could be called upon to\r\nsurrender his property (even with compensation for any damage thereto)\r\nfor the purposes of a case in which he was not directly concerned.\r\n\r\nStray references to matters of land-tenure, such as the letting of sacred\r\nlands[478] (τεμένη) belonging to a deme, are too little connected with\r\nour subject to need further mention here. And a curious story[479] of\r\nsome hill-lands (ὄρη) in the district of Oropus, divided by lot among\r\nthe ten Tribes, apparently as tribal property, is very obscure. Such\r\nallotments would probably be let to tenants. What is more interesting in\r\nconnexion with agriculture is the references to farming as a means of\r\ngetting a livelihood, few and slight though they are. Demosthenes[480]\r\nin 349 BC tells the Assembly that their right policy is to attack\r\nPhilip on his own ground, not to mobilize and then await him in Attica:\r\nsuch mobilization would be ruinous to ‘those of you who are engaged in\r\nfarming.’ The speech against Phaenippus[481] shews us an establishment\r\nproducing corn and wine and firewood and alleged to be doing very well\r\nowing to the prices then ruling in the market. We have also indications\r\nof the presence of dealers who bought up crops, no doubt to resell at\r\na profit. From the expressions[482] ὀπώραν πρίασθαι and ὀπωρώνης it\r\nmight seem that fruit-crops in particular were disposed of in this way.\r\nNaturally a crop of this sort had to be gathered quickly, and a field\r\ngang would be employed—slaves or freemen, according to circumstances. For\r\nthat in these days poverty was driving many a free citizen[483] to mean\r\nand servile occupations for a livelihood, is not only a matter of certain\r\ninference but directly affirmed by Demosthenes in 345 BC. Aeschines[484]\r\nin 344 also denies that the practice of any trade to earn a bare living\r\nwas any political disqualification to a humble citizen of good repute.\r\nFrom such poor freemen were no doubt drawn casual hands at critical\r\nmoments of farm life, analogues of the British hop-pickers[485]. But,\r\nwith every allowance for possible occasions of employing free labour,\r\nparticularly in special processes where servile apathy was plainly\r\ninjurious, the farm-picture in general as depicted in these speeches is\r\none of slave-labour. And this suggests to me a question in reference to\r\nthe disposal of Greek slaves. For the vast majority of slaves[486] in\r\nGreece, whether urban or rustic, were certainly Barbarians of several\r\ntypes for several purposes. The sale of the people of captured cities\r\nhad become quite an ordinary thing. Sparta had sinned thus in her day\r\nof power, and the example was followed from time to time by others.\r\nThe cases of Olynthus in 348 BC and Thebes in 335 fall in the present\r\nperiod. Aeschines mentions[487] some captives working chained in Philip’s\r\nvineyard; but these can only have been few. The mass were sold, and a\r\nlarge sum of money realized thereby. At Thebes the captives sold are said\r\nto have numbered 30,000. What markets absorbed these unhappy victims? I\r\ncan only guess that many found their way to Carthage and Etruria.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX. THE MACEDONIAN PERIOD 322-146 BC.\r\n\r\nThe deficiency of contemporary evidence illustrating the agricultural\r\nconditions of this troubled age in the Greek world makes it necessary\r\nto combine the various scraps of information in a general sketch.\r\nHellas had now seen its best days. The break-up of the great empire of\r\nAlexander did not restore to the little Greek states the freedom of\r\naction which had been their pride and which had been a main influence\r\nin keeping up their vitality. The outward and visible sign of their\r\nfailure was the impossibility of an independent foreign policy. The\r\nkingdoms of Alexander’s Successors might rise and fall, but Greek states\r\ncould do little to affect the results. A new world was opened to Greek\r\nenterprise in the East, and Greek mercenaries and Greek secretaries\r\ntraders and officials were carrying the Greek language and civilization\r\ninto wide lands ruled by Macedonian kings. But these were individuals,\r\nattracted by the prospect of a gainful military or civil career. Either\r\nthey settled abroad, and drained Greece of some of her ablest sons; or\r\nthey returned home enriched, and formed an element of the population\r\ncontrasting painfully with those who had stayed behind. In either case\r\nit seems certain that the movement tended to lower the standard of\r\nefficiency and patriotism in their native states. Citizen armies became\r\nmore and more difficult to maintain. The influx of money no longer locked\r\nup in Oriental treasuries only served to accentuate the old social\r\ndistinction[488] of Rich and Poor. Men who came back with fortunes meant\r\nto enjoy themselves, and they did: the doings of the returned soldier\r\nof fortune were proverbial, and a fruitful theme for comic poets. But\r\nthe spectacle of wanton luxury was more likely to lure enterprising\r\nindividuals into ventures abroad than to encourage patient industry at\r\nhome. And there is little doubt that such was the general result. The\r\nless vigorous of the poor citizens remained, a servile mob, ever ready by\r\ngrovelling compliments to earn the bounties of kings.\r\n\r\nPolitical decay and changes of social circumstance were accompanied by\r\nnew movements in the sphere of thought. It is generally observed that\r\nin this period philosophy more and more appeals to the individual man,\r\nregardless of whether he be a citizen or not. How far this movement arose\r\nout of changed conditions may be open to difference of opinion: but, as\r\nusual in human affairs, what began as an effect continued to operate as\r\na cause. The rapid spread of the Greek tongue and Greek civilization\r\neastwards, known as Hellenizing, was a powerful influence promoting\r\ncosmopolitan views. Alien blood could no longer form an unsurmountable\r\nbarrier: the Barbarian who spoke Greek and followed Greek ways had\r\nwon a claim to recognition, as had already been foreseen by the mild\r\nsincerity[489] of Isocrates. But these half-Greeks, some of them even of\r\nmixed blood, were now very numerous. They competed with genuine Hellenes\r\nat a time when the pride of the genuine Hellene was ebbing: even in\r\nintellectual pursuits, in which the Hellene still claimed preeminence,\r\nthey were serious and eventually successful rivals. It is no wonder\r\nthat earlier questionings took new life, and that consciousness of\r\ncommon humanity tended to modify old-established sentiment, even on such\r\nsubjects as the relation of master and slave. It was not merely that the\r\nphilosophic schools from different points of view, Cynic Cyrenaic Stoic\r\nEpicurean, persistently regarded man as a mental and moral unit, whatever\r\nhis political or social condition might be. The fragments and echoes of\r\nthe later Comedy suffice to shew how frankly the slave could be presented\r\non the public stage as the equal, or more than equal, of his master.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of new cities by the Successor-kings was another influence\r\nacting in the same direction. These were either royal capitals or\r\ncommercial centres, or both, like Alexandria. Others were important\r\nfrom their situation as strategic posts, such as Lysimacheia by the\r\nHellespont or Demetrias commanding the Pagasaean gulf. Competing powers\r\ncould not afford to wait for gradual growth; so great efforts were made\r\nto provide populations for the new cities without delay. Sometimes\r\nmultitudes were transplanted wholesale from older communities. In any\r\ncase no strict inquiry into the past condition of transplanted persons\r\ncan have taken place. In Sicily we know that Syracuse had become the one\r\ngreat centre of what remained of Greek power in that island. But, what\r\nwith incorporation of foreign mercenaries and enfranchisement of slaves,\r\nwhat with massacres of Greek citizens, the population of Syracuse was a\r\nmongrel mob. Such, if in a less degree, were the populations of the new\r\ncities of the kings. There was nothing national about them. In some, for\r\ninstance Alexandria, a rabble wavering between apathy and ferocity was a\r\nsubject of concern to the government. Others were more noted as centres\r\nof industry: such were some of those in Asia Minor. But common to them\r\nall was the condition, a momentous change from a Greek point of view, of\r\ndependence. They were not states, with a policy of their own, but parts\r\nof this or that kingdom. However little their overlord might interfere\r\nwith their internal affairs, still it was he, not they, that stood in\r\nrelation to the world outside. They were not independent: but as a rule\r\nthey were prosperous. In the new world of great state-units they filled\r\na necessary place, and beside them the remaining state-cities of the\r\nolder Greek world were for the most part decaying. These for their own\r\nprotection had to conform their policy to that of some greater power.\r\nPatriotism had little material in which to find expression: apathy and\r\ncosmopolitan sentiment were the inevitable result. Such was in particular\r\nthe case at Athens, which remained eminent as a centre of philosophic\r\nspeculation, attracting inquirers and students from all parts. But the\r\n‘fierce democraty’ of her imperial days was a thing of the past, and she\r\nlived upon her former glories and present subservience.\r\n\r\nIf academic distinction and cosmopolitanism went easily together,\r\ncommercial activity was hardly likely to foster jealous state-patriotism\r\nof the old sort. The leading centre of commerce in the eastern\r\nMediterranean was Rhodes. The island city was still a state. Its\r\nconvenient position as a port of call on the main trade routes gave it\r\nwealth. Its usefulness to merchants from all parts enabled it to play\r\noff the kings against one another, and to enjoy thereby much freedom of\r\naction. Its steady conservative government and its efficient navy made\r\nit a welcome check on piracy in time of peace, and a valued ally in war.\r\nIt was also a considerable intellectual centre. No power was so closely\r\nin touch with international questions generally, or so often employed as\r\numpire in disputes. Till an unfortunate blunder at the time of the war\r\nwith Perseus (168 BC) put an end to their old friendship with Rome, and\r\nled to their humiliation, the wise policy of the Rhodians preserved their\r\nindependence and earned them general goodwill. But it was surely not in a\r\nstate thriving on trade and traffic that the old narrow Greek patriotism\r\ncould find a refuge. It is not necessary to refer to more cases in\r\nparticular. The main point of interest is that in this age of cities\r\nand extensive maritime intercourse urban life was generally developing\r\nand rural life shrinking. Now it had been, and still was, the case that\r\nmixture of population normally took place in active cities, especially\r\nin seaport towns. It was in quiet country towns and hamlets that native\r\npurity of blood was most easily preserved.\r\n\r\nIf the general outline of circumstances has been fairly sketched in the\r\nabove paragraphs, we should expect to find that agriculture on a small\r\nscale was not prospering in this period. Unhappily there is hardly any\r\ndirect evidence on the point. Even indirect evidence is meagre and\r\nsometimes far from clear. One notable symptom of the age is seen in the\r\nrise of bucolic poetry. This is not a rustic growth, the rude utterance\r\nof unlettered herdsmen, but an artificial product of town-dwelling\r\npoets, who idealize the open-air life to amuse town-bred readers\r\nsomewhat weary of the everlasting streets. In the endeavour to lend an\r\nair of reality to scenes of rural life, it was convenient to credit\r\nthe rustics (shepherds goatherds etc) with a grossness of amorosity\r\nthat may perhaps be exaggerated to suit the taste of urban readers. Of\r\nthis tendency the idylls of Theocritus furnish many instances. We need\r\nnot accept them as accurate pictures of the life of herds and hinds in\r\nSicily or elsewhere, but they give us some notion of the ideas of rural\r\nlife entertained by literary men of the Alexandrian school. Beside the\r\nguardians of flocks and herds with their faithful dogs, their flutes\r\nand pan-pipes, idling in the pleasant shade and relieving the tiresome\r\nhours with musical competition, we have the hinds ploughing mowing or\r\nbusy with vintage and winepress. Some are evidently freemen, others are\r\nslaves; and we hear of overseers. There is milking and making of cheese,\r\nand woodmen[490] are not forgotten. The bloom of flowers, the murmur of\r\nstreams, the song of birds, the whisper of the refreshing breeze, form\r\nthe setting of these rural scenes, and might almost persuade us that we\r\nare privileged spectators of a genuine golden age. But the sayings and\r\ndoings of the rustics undeceive us. And the artificiality of this poetry\r\nis further betrayed by that of the panegyric and pseudo-epic poems of\r\nthe same author. His admiration of Hiero[491] of Syracuse may be mainly\r\nsincere, but his praises of Ptolemy[492] Philadelphus are the utterances\r\nof a courtier. His excursions into the region of mythology are brief,\r\nfor the reading public of his day could not stand long epics on the\r\nadventures[493] of Heracles or the Dioscuri. And the literary apparatus\r\nis antiquarian, a more or less direct imitation of the old Homeric\r\ndiction, but unable to reproduce the varied cadences. It is generally\r\nremarked that the genius of Theocritus finds its happiest and liveliest\r\nexpression in the fifteenth idyll, which depicts urban scenes. In this\r\nrespect that idyll may be compared with the mimes of =Herodas=, which\r\nillustrate, probably with truth, the shadier sides of urban life in\r\ncities of the period, which Theocritus ignores.\r\n\r\nIt is in a miniature epic[494] of mythological setting that we find\r\nthe most direct references to tillage of the soil combined with the\r\nkeeping of live stock—general agriculture, in short. We read of the\r\nplowman[495] in charge of the crops, of the hard-working diggers[496]\r\n(φυτοσκάφοι οἱ πολυεργοί), of the herdsmen[497], of an overseer[498] or\r\nsteward (αἰσυμνήτης). The staff seems to consist entirely of slaves. But\r\nit is not easy to say how far the picture is meant as a reproduction\r\nof the primitive labour-conditions of the traditional Heroic age, how\r\nfar the details may be coloured by the conditions of Theocritus’ own\r\nday. In the Idylls we find a shepherd, free presumably, in charge of\r\na flock the property[499] of his father. On the other hand ἐριθακὶς\r\nin one passage[500] seems not to be a wage-earner, but a black slave.\r\nThe ἐργάτης of the tenth idyll[501] is probably a free man, but he\r\nis enamoured of a slave girl. No conclusion can be drawn from a\r\nreference[502] to coarse but filling food meant for labourers. Roughness\r\nand a certain squalor are conventional rustic attributes: a town-bred\r\ngirl repulses the advances of a herdsman[503] with the remark ‘I’m not\r\nused to kiss rustics, but to press town-bred lips,’ and adds further\r\ndetail. Nor is the mention of Thessalian[504] serfs (πενέσται) in the\r\npanegyric of Hiero anything more than a part of the poet’s apparatus.\r\nAnd the reference[505] to the visit of Augeas to his estate, followed\r\nby a comment on the value of the master’s personal attention to his\r\nown interests, is a touch of truism common to all peoples in every\r\nage. To Theocritus, the one poet of learned Alexandria who had high\r\npoetic genius, the life and labour of farmers was evidently a matter of\r\nlittle or no concern. He could hardly idealize the Egyptian fellah. And\r\nthe one passage[506] in which he directly illustrates the position of\r\nthe Greek contemporary farmer is significant. Discontented owing to a\r\ndisappointment in love, the man is encouraged by his friend to enter the\r\nservice of the generous Ptolemy as a mercenary soldier.\r\n\r\nOne or two small references may be gleaned from the _Characters_ of\r\nAristotle’s successor =Theophrastus=. That the bulk of these typical\r\nportraits are drawn from town-folk is only to be expected, but this\r\npoint is not to be pressed overmuch, for philosophers did not frequent\r\ncountry districts. The general references to treatment of slaves, the\r\nslave-market, and so forth, are merely interesting as illustrative of\r\nthe general prevalence of slavery, chiefly of course in Athens. But we\r\ndo get to the farm in the case[507] of the rustic boor (ἄγροικος). His\r\nlack of dignity and proper reserve is shewn in talking to his slaves on\r\nmatters of importance: he makes confidants of them, and so far forgets\r\nhimself as to lend a hand in grinding the corn. It has been remarked that\r\nGreek manners allowed a certain familiarity[508] in the relations of\r\nmaster and slave. But this person overdoes it: in Peripatetic language,\r\nhe transgresses the doctrine of the Mean. He employs also hired men\r\n(μισθωτοί), and to them he recounts all the political gossip (τὰ ἀπὸ τῆς\r\nἐκκλησίας), evidently a sign of his awkwardness and inability to hold\r\nhis tongue. I take these wage-earners to be poor freemen. They might\r\nbe slaves hired from another owner: this practice appears elsewhere in\r\nconnexion with town slaves. But the general impoverishment of the old\r\nGreece, save in a few districts, is beyond doubt: and the demand for\r\nslaves in new cities would raise the price of slaves and tend to drive\r\nthe free poor to manual labour.\r\n\r\nThe exact dates of the birth and death of =Polybius= are uncertain, but\r\nas an observer of events his range extended from about 190 or 189 to 122\r\nor 121 BC. Though his references to agriculture are few and separately\r\nof small importance, they have a cumulative value on certain points. He\r\nwrote as historian of the fortunes of the civilized world of his day,\r\ntreated as a whole, in which a series of interconnected struggles led up\r\nto the supremacy of Rome. His Greece is the Greece of the Leagues. No\r\nleading state of the old models had been able to unite the old Hellas\r\neffectively under its headship, but the Macedonian conquest had plainly\r\nproved that in isolation[509] the little separate states had no future\r\nopen to them but slavery. The doings of Alexander’s Successors further\r\ninforced the lesson. It was clear that the only hope of freedom lay in\r\nunion so far as possible, for thus only could Greek powers be created\r\nable to act with any sort of independence and self-respect in their\r\nrelations with the new great powers outside. Accordingly there took\r\nplace a revival of old local unions in districts where a community of\r\ninterest between tribes or cities had in some form or other long been\r\nrecognized. Such were the tribal League of Aetolia and the city League of\r\nAchaia. But these two were but notable instances of a federative movement\r\nmuch wider. The attempt to unite the scattered towns of Arcadia, with a\r\nfederal centre at Megalopolis, seems to have been less successful. But\r\nthe general aim of the movement towards federalism in Greece is clear.\r\nThat it did not in the end save Greek freedom was due to two defects: it\r\nwas too partial and too late. For no general union was achieved. Greek\r\njealousy remained, and Leagues fought with Leagues in internal strife:\r\nthen they were drawn into quarrels not their own, as allies of great\r\nforeign powers. It was no longer possible to remain neutral with safety.\r\nNo League was strong enough to face the risk of compromising itself with\r\na victorious great power. Achaean statesmen did their best, but they too\r\ncould not save their country from ruin, once the League became entangled\r\nin the diplomacy of Rome. Nor was it the old Hellas alone that thus\r\ndrifted to its doom. Between Rome and Carthage the western Greeks lost\r\nwhatever power and freedom their own disunion and quarrels had left them.\r\nThe Rhodian republic and its maritime League of islanders had to become\r\nthe subject allies of Rome.\r\n\r\nOne point stands out clearly enough. In the Greece of the third century\r\nBC the question of food-supply was as pressing as it had ever been in the\r\npast. The operations of King Philip were often conditioned by the ease or\r\ndifficulty of getting supplies[510] of corn for his troops: that is, he\r\nhad to work on an insufficient margin of such resources. In 219, after\r\ndriving the Dardani out of Macedonia, he had to dismiss his men[511] that\r\nthey might get in their harvest. In 218, the success of his Peloponnesian\r\ncampaign was largely dependent[512] on the supplies and booty captured in\r\nElis, in Cephallenia, in Laconia; and on the subsidies of corn and money\r\nvoted by his Achaean allies. The destruction of crops[513] was as of old\r\na principal means of warfare. And when he had to meet the Roman invasion\r\nin 197, the race to secure what corn[514] was to be had was again a\r\nleading feature of the war. It is true that the feeding of armies was a\r\ndifficulty elsewhere[515], as in Asia, and in all ages and countries:\r\nalso that difficulties of transport were a considerable part of it. But\r\nthe war-indemnities[516] fixed by treaties, including great quantities of\r\ncorn, shew the extreme importance attached to this item. And the gifts\r\nof corn[517] to the Rhodian republic after the great earthquake (about\r\n225 BC), and the leave granted them[518] in 169 by the Roman Senate to\r\nimport a large quantity from Sicily, tell the same story. Another article\r\nin great demand, only to be got wholesale from certain countries, such\r\nas Macedonia, was timber. It was wanted for domestic purposes and for\r\nconstruction of military engines, which were greatly developed in the\r\nwars of the Successors; but above all for shipbuilding, commercial and\r\nnaval. Rhodes in particular[519] needed a great supply; and the gifts\r\nof her friends in 224 BC were largely in the form of timber. There was\r\nno doubt a great demand for it at Alexandria, Syracuse, Corinth, and\r\ngenerally in seaport towns. It is evident that in strictly Greek lands\r\nthe wood grown was chiefly of small size, suitable for fuel. There is\r\nno sign of an advance on the conditions of an earlier time in the way of\r\nafforestation: nor indeed was such a policy likely.\r\n\r\nBut food had to be found somehow. Agriculture therefore had to go on.\r\nOutside the commercial centres, where food-stuffs could be imported\r\nby sea, there was no alternative: the population had to depend on the\r\nproducts of local tillage and pasturage. A few cities celebrated as\r\nart-centres might contrive to live by the sale of their works, but this\r\nhardly affects the general situation. We should therefore very much like\r\nto know how things stood on the land. Was the tendency towards large\r\nlanded estates, or was the small-farm system reviving? Was farm-labour\r\nchiefly that of freemen, or that of slaves? If of freemen, was it\r\nchiefly that of small owners, or that of wage-earners? In default of any\r\nauthoritative statement, we have to draw what inferences we can from\r\nslight casual indications. That the career of Alexander was directly and\r\nindirectly the cause of great disturbances in Greek life, is certain.\r\nOf the ways in which it operated, two are of special importance.\r\nThe compulsory restoration of exiles[520] whose properties had been\r\nconfiscated led to claims for restitution; and in the matter of real\r\nestate the particular land in question was easily identified and made the\r\nsubject of a bitter contest. Now uncertainty of tenure is notoriously\r\na check on improvement, and the effect of the restorations was to make\r\ntenures uncertain. At the same time the prospects of professional\r\nsoldiering in the East were a strong temptation to able-bodied husbandmen\r\nwho were not very prosperous. From the rural parts of Greece a swarm of\r\nmercenaries went forth to join the host of Alexander, and the movement\r\ncontinued long. In the stead of one Alexander, there arose the rival\r\nSuccessor-kings, who competed in the military market for the intelligent\r\nGreeks. It was worth their while, and they paid well for a good article.\r\nSo all through the third century there was a draining away of some of the\r\nbest blood of Greece. Some of these men had no doubt parted with farms\r\nbefore setting out on the great venture. Of those who survived the wars,\r\nsome settled down abroad as favoured citizens in some of the new cities\r\nfounded by the kings. The few who returned to Greece with money saved\r\ndid not come home to labour on a small farm: they settled in some city\r\nwhere they could see life and enjoy the ministrations of male and female\r\nslaves. Now it is not likely that all lands disposed of by these men were\r\ntaken up by husbandmen exposed to the same temptations. Probably the\r\ngreater part were bought up by the wealthier residents at home, and so\r\nwent to increase large holdings.\r\n\r\nHow far do stray notices bear out this conclusion? At Athens in 322\r\nBC a constitution was imposed by Antipater, deliberately framed for\r\nthe purpose of placing power in the hands of the richer classes. He\r\nleft 9000 citizens in possession of the full franchise, excluding\r\n12000 poor. For the latter he offered to provide allotments of land in\r\nThrace. Accounts[521] vary, but it seems that some accepted the offer\r\nand emigrated. It was not a compulsory deportation, but it was exile.\r\nEconomically it may have been a relief to Athens by reducing the number\r\nof citizens who shared civic perquisites. But it had no tendency to bring\r\nmore citizens back on to Attic land: such a move would have implied\r\ndisplacement of present landholders, whom it was Antipater’s policy to\r\nconciliate. In the course of the third century we get a glimpse of the\r\nagrarian situation at Sparta. It is clear that the movement, already\r\nnoted by Aristotle, towards land-monopoly[522] in the hands of a few\r\nrich, had been steadily going on. It ended by provoking a communistic\r\nreaction under the reforming kings Agis IV and Cleomenes III. Blood\r\nwas shed, and Sparta became a disorderly state, the cause of many\r\ntroubles in Greece down to the time of the Roman conquest. The growing\r\nAchaean League, in the side of which revolutionary Sparta was a thorn,\r\nwas essentially a conservative federation. However democratic its\r\nindividual members might be, the constitution of the League worked[523]\r\nvery effectively in the interest of the rich. On the occasion of the\r\ncapture of Megalopolis by Cleomenes =Polybius= is at pains to warn his\r\nreaders[524] against believing stories of the immense booty taken there.\r\nThough the Peloponnese had enjoyed a period of prosperity, still these\r\nstories are gross exaggerations. Megalopolis, an important member of\r\nthe League, had been from the first laid out on too ambitious[525] a\r\nscale. That the ‘Great City’ was a great desert, had found proverbial\r\nexpression in a verse. A little later, when Philip was campaigning in\r\nPeloponnesus, we hear of the great prosperity[526] of Elis, especially in\r\nagriculture. The Eleans had enjoyed a great advantage in the protection\r\nafforded them by religion as guardians of Olympia. We may add that they\r\nwere allied with the Aetolian League, whose hostility other Greek states\r\nwere not forward to provoke. A class of wealthy resident landlords\r\nexisted in Elis, and much of the country was good farming land under\r\ntillage. But in most of the Achaean and Arcadian[527] districts pastoral\r\nindustry, and therefore sparse population, was the rule, owing to the\r\nmountainous nature of those parts. In central Greece we need only refer\r\nto the restored Thebes, centre once more of a Boeotian confederacy. The\r\nfertile lowland of Boeotia supplied plenty of victual; and among Greek\r\ndelicacies the eels of the lake Copais were famous. Boeotians were known\r\nas a well-nourished folk. In the fragments of the comic poet Eubulus[528]\r\n(assigned to the fourth century BC) we have them depicted as gluttonous,\r\nwith some grossness of detail. Such being their tradition, I can see\r\nnothing strange in the picture[529] given of the Boeotians in his own\r\nday by =Polybius=. The ceaseless guzzling, the idleness and political\r\ncorruption of the people, may be overdrawn. I admit that such qualities\r\nwere not favourable to lasting prosperity; but their prosperity was not\r\nlasting. In the view of Polybius the subjection of Greece by the Romans\r\nwas rather an effect than a cause of Greek degeneracy, and I dare not\r\ncontradict him. Moreover a piece of confirmatory evidence relative to\r\nthe third century BC occurs in a fragment of =Heraclides Ponticus=. In\r\na traveller’s description[530] of Greece Boeotia is thus referred to.\r\nRound Tanagra the land is not very rich in corn-crops, but stands at\r\nthe head of Boeotian wine-production. The people are well-to-do, but\r\nlive simply: they are all farmers (γεωργοί), not labourers (ἐργάται). At\r\nAnthedon on the coast the people are all fishermen ferrymen etc: they do\r\nnot cultivate the land, indeed they have none. Of Thebes he remarks that\r\nthe territory is good for horse-breeding, a green well-watered rolling\r\ncountry, with more gardens than any other Greek city owns. But, he adds,\r\nthe people are violent undisciplined and quarrelsome. I think we may see\r\nhere an earlier stage in the degeneracy that disgusted Polybius.\r\n\r\nIn all this there is nothing to suggest that small farming was common and\r\nprosperous during the Macedonian period in Greece. The natural, inference\r\nis rather that agriculture in certain favoured districts was carried\r\non by a limited number of large landowners on a large scale, pastoral\r\nindustry varying locally according to circumstances. The development of\r\nurban life and luxury, and the agrarian troubles in the Peloponnese, are\r\nboth characteristic phenomena of the age. In town and country alike the\r\nvital fact of civilization was the conflict of interests between rich\r\nand poor. Macedonia presents a contrast. There no great cities drew the\r\npeople away from the country. A hardy and numerous population supplied\r\nthe material for national armies whenever needed, and loyalty to the\r\nreigning king gave unity to national action. Hence the long domination of\r\nMacedon in Greece; the only serious opposition being that of the Aetolian\r\nLeague. Of all the Successor-kingdoms, Macedon alone was able to make any\r\nstand against the advance of Rome.\r\n\r\nIt remains to consider the few indications—I can hardly call them\r\nreferences—from which we can get a little light on the labour-question.\r\nThe passages cited from Theophrastus and Theocritus point to the\r\nprevalence of slave-labour. And the same may be said of =Polybius=. In\r\nspeaking[531] of the blunder in exaggerating the value of the booty\r\ntaken at Megalopolis, he says ‘Why, even in these more peaceful and\r\nprosperous days you could not raise so great a sum of money in all the\r\nPeloponnese out of the mere movables (ἐπίπλων) unless you took slaves\r\ninto account (χωρὶς σωμάτων).’ His word for live-stock not human is\r\nθρέμματα. Evidently to him slave-property is a large item in the value\r\nof estates. Again, speaking of the importance of Byzantium[532] on the\r\nPontic trade-route, he insists on the plentiful and useful supply of\r\nbestial and human stock to Greece by this traffic. The high farming of\r\nrural Elis[533] is shewn in its being full of σώματα and farm-stock\r\n(κατασκευῆς). Hence these ‘bodies’ formed a considerable part of the\r\nbooty taken there by Philip. And in the claims[534] made at Rome in 183\r\nBC against Philip a part related to slave-property. References to the\r\nsale of prisoners of war, to piracy and kidnapping, are frequent: but\r\nthey only concern us as indicating time-honoured means of supplying the\r\nslave-market. As for rowing ships, so for heavy farm-work, able-bodied\r\nmen were wanted. At a pinch such slaves could be, and were, employed\r\nin war[535], with grant or promise of manumission: but this was a step\r\nonly taken in the last resort. A curious remark[536] of =Polybius= when\r\nspeaking of Arcadia must not be overlooked. In 220 BC an Aetolian force\r\ninvaded Achaia and penetrated into northern Arcadia, where they took\r\nthe border town of Cynaetha, and after wholesale massacre and pillage\r\nburnt it on their retreat. The city had for years suffered terribly\r\nfrom internal strife, in which the doings of restored exiles had played\r\na great part. Polybius says that the Cynaethans were thought to have\r\ndeserved the disaster that had now fallen upon them. Why? Because of\r\ntheir savagery (ἀγριότητος). They were Arcadians. The Arcadians as a\r\nrace-unit (ἔθνος) enjoy a reputation for virtue throughout Greece,\r\nas a kindly hospitable and religious folk. But the Cynaethans outdid\r\nall Greeks in cruelty and lawlessness. This is to be traced to their\r\nneglect of the time-honoured Arcadian tradition, the general practice\r\nof vocal and instrumental music. This practice was deliberately adopted\r\nas a refining agency, to relieve and temper the roughness and harshness\r\nincidental to men living toilsome lives in an inclement climate. Such was\r\nthe design of the old Arcadians, on consideration of the circumstances,\r\none point in which was that their people generally worked in person (τὴν\r\nἑκάστων αὐτουργίαν). On this I need only remark that he is referring to\r\nthe past, but may or may not include the Arcadians of his own day: and\r\nrepeat what I have said before, that to be αὐτουργὸς does not exclude\r\nemployment of slaves as well. That there was still more personal labour\r\nin rural Arcadia than in many other parts of Greece, is probable. But\r\nthat is all.\r\n\r\nThat the slavery-question was a matter of some interest in Greece may be\r\ninferred from the pains taken by =Polybius=[537] to refute an assertion\r\nof =Timaeus=, that to acquire slaves was not a Greek custom. The context\r\nis lost, and we cannot tell whether it was a general assertion or not. If\r\ngeneral, it was no doubt nonsense. A more effective piece of evidence is\r\nthe report[538] of =Megasthenes=, who visited India early in the third\r\ncentury. He told his Greek readers that in India slavery was unknown.\r\nThe contrast to Greece was of course the interesting point. It is also\r\naffirmed[539] that in this period manumissions became more common, as\r\na result of the economic decline of Greece combined with the moral\r\nevolution to be traced in the philosophic schools. Calderini, from whom\r\nI take this, is the leading authority on Greek manumission. And, so far\r\nas the records are concerned, the number of inscribed ‘acts’ recovered\r\nfrom the important centre of Delphi[540] confirms the assertion. From\r\n201 to 140 BC these documents are exceptionally numerous. But the not\r\nunfrequent stipulation found in them, that the freed man or woman shall\r\nremain in attendance[541] on his or her late owner for the owner’s life\r\nor for some fixed period, or shall continue to practise a trade (or even\r\nlearn a trade) on the profits of which the late owner or his heirs shall\r\nhave a claim, suggest strongly that these manumissions were the rewards\r\nof domestic service or technical skill. I do not believe that they have\r\nany connexion with rustic[542] slavery. Calderini also holds that as\r\nGreek industries and commerce declined free labour competed more and\r\nmore with slave-labour. So far as urban trades are concerned, this is\r\nprobably true: and likewise a certain decline in domestic slavery due to\r\nthe straitened circumstances of families and experience of the waste and\r\nnuisance of large slave-households. This last point, already noticed[543]\r\ne.g. by Aristotle, is to be found expressed in utterances of the comic\r\npoets. Rustic slavery appears in the fragments of Menander’s Γεωργός, but\r\nthe old farmer’s slaves are Barbarians, who will do nothing to help him\r\nwhen accidentally hurt, and who are hardly likely to receive favours.\r\nThe ordinary view of agriculture in Menander’s time seems most truly\r\nexpressed in his saying[544] that it is a slave’s business.\r\n\r\nMention of the comic poets may remind us that most of the surviving\r\nmatter of the later Comedy has reached us in the Latin versions and\r\nadaptations of =Plautus= and =Terence=. It is necessary to speak of their\r\nevidence separately, in particular where slavery is in question, for the\r\nrelative passages are liable to be touched with Roman colouring. In the\r\ncase of manumission this is especially clear, but to pursue the topic in\r\ndetail is beyond my present purpose. The passages of =Plautus= bearing\r\non rustic life are not many, but the picture so far as it goes is clear\r\nand consistent. In general the master is represented as a man of means\r\nwith a house in town and a country estate outside. The latter is worked\r\nby slaves under a slave-bailiff or steward (_vilicus_). The town-house is\r\nstaffed by slaves, but the headman is less absolute than the steward on\r\nthe farm: departmental chiefs, such as the cook, are important parts of\r\nthe household. This is natural enough, for the master generally resides\r\nthere himself, and only pays occasional[545] visits to the farm. The two\r\nsets of slaves are kept apart. If the steward[546] or some other trusted\r\nfarm-slave has to come to town, he is practically a stranger, and a\r\nquarrel is apt to arise with leading domestics: for his rustic appearance\r\nand manners are despised by the pampered menials. But he is aware that\r\nhis turn may come: some day the master in wrath may consign the offending\r\ntown-slave to farm-labour, and then—. Apart from slavery, rustic life\r\nis regarded[547] as favourable to good morals: honest labour, frugal\r\nhabits, freedom from urban temptations, commend it to fathers who desire\r\nto preserve their sons from corrupting debauchery. In short, the urban\r\nmoralist idealizes the farm. Whether he would by choice reside there, is\r\nquite another thing. Clearly the average young citizen would not. That\r\nthe farm is occasionally used[548] as a retreat, is no more than a point\r\nof dramatic convenience. In one passage[549] we have a picture of a small\r\nfarm, with slave-labour employed on it. Freemen as agricultural labourers\r\nhardly appear at all. But a significant dialogue[550] between an old\r\nfreeman and a young one runs thus: ‘Country life is a life of toil.’\r\n‘Aye, but city indigence is far more so.’ The youth, who has offered to\r\ndo farm-work, is representative of that class of urban poor, whose lot\r\nwas doubtless a very miserable one. Very seldom do we hear anything of\r\nthem, for our records in general only take account of the master and the\r\nslave. In the play just referred to[551] there occur certain terms more\r\nor less technical. The neutral _operarius_ seems equivalent to ἐργάτης,\r\nand _mercennarius_ to μισθωτός, distinct from[552] _servus_. But these\r\nterms are not specially connected with agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe references in =Terence= give us the same picture. An old man of 60\r\nor more is blamed[553] by a friend. ‘You have a first-rate farm and a\r\nnumber of slaves: why will you persist in working yourself to make up\r\nfor their laziness? Your labour would be better spent in keeping them\r\nto their tasks.’ The old man explains[554] that he is punishing himself\r\nfor his treatment of his only son. In order to detach the youth from\r\nan undesirable amour, he had used the stock reproaches of fathers to\r\nerring sons. He had said ‘At your time of life I wasn’t hanging about a\r\nmistress: I went soldiering in Asia for a living, and there I won both\r\nmoney and glory.’ At length the young man could stand it no longer: he\r\nwent off to Asia and entered the service of one of the kings. The old\r\nman cannot forgive himself, and is now busy tormenting himself for his\r\nconduct. He has sold off[555] all his slaves, male or female, save those\r\nwhose labour on the farm pays for its cost, and is wearing himself out\r\nas a mere farm hand. Another[556] old farmer, a man of small means who\r\nmakes his living by farming, is evidently not the owner but a tenant.\r\nAnother[557] has gone to reside on his farm, to make it pay; otherwise\r\nthe expenses at home cannot be met. In general country life is held up as\r\na model[558] of frugality and industry. In one passage[559] we hear of\r\na hired wage-earner employed on a farm (_a villa mercennarium_) whom I\r\ntake to be a free man, probably employed for some special service. Such\r\nare the gleanings to be got from these Roman echoes of the later Attic\r\ncomedy. I see no reason to believe that they are modified by intrusion of\r\ndetails drawn from Italy. The period in which Plautus and Terence wrote\r\n(about 230-160 BC) included many changes in Roman life, particularly\r\nin agriculture. In large parts of Italy the peasant farmers were being\r\nsuperseded by great landlords whose estates were worked by slave-labour,\r\nand the conditions of farm life as shewn by the Attic playwrights were\r\nnot so strange to a Roman audience as to need recasting. And we can only\r\nremark that the evidence drawn from the passages above referred to is in\r\nfull agreement with that taken from other sources.\r\n\r\nA very interesting sidelight on conditions in Greece, agriculture\r\nincluded, towards the end of the third century BC, is thrown by the\r\ncorrespondence[560] of =Philip V of Macedon= with the authorities of\r\nLarisa. An inscription found at Larisa preserves this important record.\r\nTwo points must first be noted, to give the historical setting of the\r\nwhole affair. Thessaly was under Macedonian overlordship, and its\r\neconomic and military strength a matter of concern to Philip, who had\r\nsucceeded to the throne of Macedon in 220 BC. Moreover, the defeat of\r\nCarthage in the first Punic war (264-41), the Roman occupation of the\r\ngreater part of Sicily and Sardinia, the Gallic wars and extension of\r\nRoman dominion in Italy, the Illyrian war (230-29) and intervention\r\nof Rome beyond the Adriatic, had attracted the attention of all the\r\nGreek powers. The western Republic had for some years been carefully\r\nwatched, and the admission of Corcyra Epidamnus and Apollonia to the\r\nRoman alliance was especially disquieting to the Macedonian king. So\r\nin 219 BC, just before the second Punic war, Philip sent =a letter\r\nto Larisa=, pointing out that the number of their citizens had been\r\nreduced by losses in recent wars and urging them to include in their\r\nfranchise the Thessalians and other Greeks resident in the city. Among\r\nother advantages, the country[561] would be more fully cultivated. The\r\nLarisaeans obeyed his injunctions. In 217 the war in Greece was ended by\r\nhis concluding peace with the Aetolians, his chief antagonists. Hannibal\r\nwas now in Italy, and the victory of Cannae in 216 raised hopes in Philip\r\nof using the disasters of the Romans to drive them out of Illyria. In\r\n215 he concluded an alliance with Hannibal. The Romans replied by naval\r\nactivity in the Adriatic and later by stirring up Greek powers, above\r\nall the Aetolians, to renew the war against him. Meanwhile things had\r\nnot gone on quietly at Larisa. The old Thessalian noble families had\r\ngiven way to the king’s pressure unwillingly for the moment, but internal\r\ntroubles soon broke out. The nobles regained control and annulled the\r\nrecent concessions. Philip therefore addressed to them a =second letter=\r\nin 214, censuring their conduct, and calling upon them to give effect to\r\nthe enfranchisement-policy previously agreed to. Thus they would not only\r\nconform to his decision as their overlord, but would best serve their\r\nown interests. Their city would gain strength by increasing the number\r\nof citizens, and they would not have their territory disgracefully[562]\r\nlying waste (καὶ τὴν χώραν μὴ ὥσπερ νῦν αἰσχρῶς χερσεύεσθαι). He went on\r\nto refer to the advantageous results of such incorporations elsewhere:\r\nciting in particular the experience of Rome, whose growth and colonial\r\nexpansion were the fruits of a franchise-policy so generous as to grant\r\ncitizenship even to manumitted slaves. He called upon the Larisaeans to\r\nface the question without aristocratic prejudice (ἀφιλοτίμως). And the\r\nLarisaeans again complied.\r\n\r\nNow here we have a glimpse of agricultural decline in one of the most\r\nfertile parts of Greece. The stress laid upon it by Philip shews that\r\nto him it seemed a very serious matter. He saw trouble coming, and\r\nwished to keep his dependent allies strong. That his difficulty lay\r\nin controlling the aristocratic families, who still retained much\r\nof their former power, is clear. After his defeat in 197 the Romans\r\nrestored[563] the aristocratic governments in Thessalian cities; indeed\r\nall through the wars of this period in Greece the popular parties\r\ninclined to Macedon, while the propertied classes favoured Rome. In\r\nThessaly the private estates of the nobles were cultivated by serfs.\r\nHow would an incorporation of more citizens tend to promote a fuller\r\ncultivation of the land? I think we may take it for granted that the new\r\ncitizens were not expected to till the soil in person. That they were\r\nto have unemployed serfs assigned to them, and so to enter the ranks of\r\ncultivating landlords, is a bold assumption: for we do not know that\r\nthere were any unemployed serfs or that any distribution of land was\r\ncontemplated. I can only suggest that the effect of receiving citizenship\r\nwould be to acquire the right of holding real estate. Then, if we\r\nsuppose that there were at the time landed estates left vacant by the\r\nwar-casualties to which the king refers, and that each of these carried\r\nwith it a right to a certain supply of serf labour, we do get some sort\r\nof answer to the question. But so far as I know this is nothing but\r\nguesswork. More owners interested in the profits of farming would tend,\r\nif labour were available, to employ more labour on the farms. In short,\r\nwe have evidence of the decay of agriculture in a particular district and\r\nperiod, but as to the exact causes of this decay, and the exact nature of\r\nthe means proposed for checking it, we are sadly in the dark.\r\n\r\nThe garden or orchard had always been a favourite institution in Greek\r\nlife, and the growth of cities did not make it less popular. The land\r\nimmediately beyond the city walls was often laid out in this manner.\r\nWhen Aratus in 251 BC took Sicyon and attached it to the Achaean League,\r\nthe surprise was effected by way of a suburban[564] garden. And we have\r\nno reason to suppose that holdings near a city lacked cultivators.\r\nEven in the horrible period of confusion and bloodshed at Syracuse,\r\nfrom the death of Dionysius the elder to the victory of Timoleon, we\r\nhear[565] of Syracusans living in the country, and of the usual clamour\r\nfor redistribution of lands. In the endeavour to repopulate the city an\r\ninvitation to settlers was issued, with offer[566] of land-allotments,\r\nand apparently the promise was kept. These notices suggest that there\r\nwas a demand for suburban holdings, but tell us nothing as to the\r\nstate of things in the districts further afield, or as to the class of\r\nlabour employed on the land. In any case Syracuse was a seaport, and\r\naccustomed to get a good part of its supplies by sea. Very different was\r\nthe situation in Peloponnesus, where the up-country towns had to depend\r\nchiefly on the produce of their own territories. There land-hunger was\r\never present. The estates of men driven out in civil broils were seized\r\nby the victorious party, and restoration of exiles at once led to a\r\nfresh conflict over claims to restitution of estates. One of the most\r\ndifficult problems[567] with which Aratus had to deal at Sicyon was this;\r\nand in the end he only solved it by the use of a large sum of money, the\r\ngift of Ptolemy Philadelphus. The restored exiles on this occasion are\r\nsaid to have been not less than 580 in all. They had been expelled by\r\ntyrants who had in recent years ruled the city, and whose policy it had\r\nevidently been to drive out the men of property—sworn foes of tyrants—and\r\nto reward their own adherents out of confiscated lands. To reverse this\r\npolicy was the lifelong aim of Aratus. In the generation following, the\r\nlife of his successor Philopoemen gives us a little light on agriculture\r\nfrom another point of view, that of the soldier. He was resolved to make\r\nthe army of the Achaean League an efficient force. As a young man he\r\nconcluded[568] that the Greek athletic training was not consistent with\r\nmilitary life, in which the endurance of hardship and ability to subsist\r\non any diet were primary necessities. Therefore he devoted his spare time\r\nto agriculture, working[569] in person on his farm, about 2½ miles from\r\nMegalopolis, sharing the labour and habits of the labourers (ἐργατῶν).\r\nThe use of the neutral word leaves a doubt as to whether freemen or\r\nslaves are meant: taken in connexion with the passages cited from\r\nPolybius, it is perhaps more likely that the reference is to slaves. But\r\nthe chief interest of the story as preserved by =Plutarch= lies in the\r\ndiscovery that, compared with athletes, husbandmen are better military\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions of Beloch[570] as to the population of Peloponnesus in\r\nthis period call for serious consideration. His opinion is that the\r\nnumber capable of bearing arms declined somewhat since the middle of the\r\nfourth century, though the wholesale emancipation of Spartan Helots must\r\nbe reckoned as an addition. But on the whole the free population was\r\nat the beginning of the second century about equal to the joint total\r\nof free and Helot population at the end of the fifth century. On the\r\nother hand, the slave population had in the interval greatly increased.\r\nHe points to the importance of a slave corps[571] in the defence of\r\nMegalopolis when besieged in 318 BC: to the Roman and Italian[572] slaves\r\n(prisoners sold by Hannibal) in Achaean territory, found and released\r\nin 194 BC, some 1200 in number: and to the levy[573] of manumitted\r\nhome-born slaves in the last struggle of the League against Rome. I must\r\nsay that this evidence, taken by itself, hardly seems enough to sustain\r\nthe great historian’s broad conclusion. But many of the passages cited\r\nin preceding sections lend it support, and I am therefore not disposed\r\nto challenge its general probability. It may be added that increase in\r\nthe number of slaves suggests an increase of large holdings cultivated\r\nby slave labour; and that the breeding of home-born (οἰκογενεῖς) slaves\r\ncould be more easily practised by owners of a large staff than on a small\r\nscale. Moreover the loss of slaves levied for war purposes would fall\r\nchiefly on their wealthy owners. The men of property were rightly or\r\nwrongly suspected of leaning to Rome, and were not likely to be spared by\r\nthe demagogues who presided over the last frantic efforts of ‘freedom’\r\nin Greece. The truth seems to be that circumstances were more and more\r\nunfavourable to the existence of free husbandmen on small farms, the very\r\nclass of whose solid merits statesmen and philosophers had shewn warm\r\nappreciation. The division between the Rich, who wanted to keep what they\r\nhad and get more, and the Poor, who wanted to take the property of the\r\nRich, was the one ever-significant fact. And the establishment of Roman\r\nsupremacy settled the question for centuries to come. Roman capitalism,\r\nhastening to exploit the world for its own ends, had no mercy for the\r\nsmall independent worker in any department of life. In Greece under the\r\nsway of Rome there is no doubt that free population declined, and the\r\nstate of agriculture went from bad to worse.\r\n\r\nAt this point, when the Greek world passes under the sway of Rome, it is\r\nnecessary to pause and turn back to consider the fragmentary record of\r\nearly Italian agriculture. This one great staple industry is represented\r\nas the economic foundation of Roman political and military greatness.\r\nNo small part of the surviving Latin literature glorifies the soundness\r\nof the Roman farmer-folk and the exploits of farmer-heroes in the good\r\nold days, and laments the rottenness that attended their decay. How far\r\nthis tradition is to be accepted as it stands, or what reservations on\r\nits acceptance should be made, and in particular the introduction or\r\nextension of slave-labour, are the questions with which it will be our\r\nmain business to deal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROME—EARLY PERIOD\r\n\r\n\r\nXX. THE TRADITIONS COMBINED AND DISCUSSED.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to Roman agriculture, and agricultural labour in particular,\r\nwe have to deal with evidence very different in character from that\r\npresented by the Greek world. This will be most clearly seen if we accept\r\nthe very reasonable division of periods made by Wallon in his _History\r\nof Slavery_—the first down to 201 BC, the end of the second Punic war,\r\nthe second to the age of the Antonine emperors, 200 BC to the death of\r\nMarcus Aurelius in 180 AD, and the third that of the later Empire. For\r\nof the first we have no contemporary or nearly contemporary pictures\r\nsurviving. Traditions preserved by later writers, notes of antiquaries\r\non words and customs long obscured by time and change, are the staple\r\nmaterial at hand. Even with the help of a few survivals in law, inference\r\nfrom such material is unavoidably timid and incomplete. In collecting\r\nwhat the later Romans believed of their past we get vivid impressions\r\nof the opinions and prejudices that went to form the Roman spirit. But\r\nit does not follow that we can rely on these opinions as solid evidence\r\nof facts. An instance may be found in the assertion[574] that a clause\r\nrequiring the employment of a certain proportion of free labourers to\r\nslaves was included in the Licinian laws of 367 BC. This used to be\r\ntaken as a fact, and inferences were drawn from it, but it is now with\r\nreason regarded as an ‘anticipation,’ transferring the fact of a later\r\nattempt of the kind to an age in which the slave-gangs were not as yet an\r\nevident economic and social danger. In the second period, that of Roman\r\ngreatness, we have not only contemporary witness for much of the time in\r\nthe form of references and allusions in literature, but the works of the\r\ngreat writers on agriculture, Cato Varro and Columella, not to mention\r\nthe great compiler Pliny, fall within it, and give us on the whole a\r\npicture exceptionally complete. We know more of the farm-management and\r\nlabour-conditions in this period than we do of most matters of antiquity.\r\nThe last period sees the development of a change the germs of which are\r\nno doubt to be detected in the preceding one. The great strain on the\r\nEmpire, owing to the internal decay and the growing pressure of financial\r\nnecessities, made the change inevitable; economic freedom and proprietary\r\nslavery died down, and we have before us the transition to predial\r\nserfdom, the system of the unfree tenant bound to the soil. The record of\r\nthis change is chiefly preserved in the later Roman Law.\r\n\r\nMy first business is therefore to inquire what the tradition of early\r\ntimes amounts to, and how far it may reasonably be taken as evidence of\r\nfact. And it must be borne in mind that my subject is not the technical\r\ndetails of agriculture in general, but the nature of the labour employed\r\nin agriculture. In ages when voluntary peace between empires and peoples\r\non _bona fide_ equal terms was never a realized fact, and as yet hardly a\r\ndream, the stability of a state depended on the strength of its military\r\nforces,—their number, efficiency, and means of renewal. Mere numbers[575]\r\nwere tried and failed. The hire of professional soldiers of fortune[576]\r\nmight furnish technical skill, but it was politically dangerous. Their\r\nleaders had no personal sentiment in favour of the state employing them,\r\nand their interest or ambition disposed them rather to support a tyrant,\r\nor to become tyrants themselves, than to act as loyal defenders of the\r\nfreedom of the state. Mercenaries[577] hired in the mass, barbarians,\r\nwere less skilled but not less dangerous. That a well-trained army of\r\ncitizens was the most trustworthy organ of state-protection, was not\r\ndisputed: the combination of loyalty with skill made it a most efficient\r\nweapon. The ratio of citizen enthusiasm to the confidence created by\r\nexact discipline varied greatly in the Greek republics of the fifth\r\ncentury BC. But these two elements were normally present, though in\r\nvarious proportions. The common defect, most serious in those states that\r\nplayed an active part, was the smallness of scale that made it difficult\r\nto keep up the strength of citizen armies exposed to the wastage of\r\nwar. A single great disaster might and did turn a struggle for empire\r\ninto a desperate fight for existence. The constrained transition to\r\nemployment of mercenary troops as the principal armed force of states\r\nwas both a symptom and a further cause of decay in the Greek republics.\r\nFor the sturdy soldiers of fortune were generally drawn from the rustic\r\npopulation of districts in which agriculture filled a more important\r\nplace than political life. There is little doubt that a decline of\r\nfood-production in Greece was the result: and scarcity of food had long\r\nbeen a persistent difficulty underlying and explaining most of the doings\r\nof the Greeks. The rise of Macedon and the conquests of Alexander proved\r\nthe military value of a national army of trained rustics, and reasserted\r\nthe superiority of such troops to the armed multitudes of the East. But\r\nAlexander’s career did not leave the world at peace. His empire broke\r\nup in a period of dynastic wars; for to supply an imperial army strong\r\nenough to support a single control and guarantee internal peace was\r\nbeyond the resources of Macedonia.\r\n\r\nIf an army of considerable strength, easily maintained and recruited,\r\nloyal, the servant of the state and not its master, was necessary for\r\ndefence and as an instrument of foreign politics, there was room for a\r\nbetter solution of the problem than had been found in Greece or the East.\r\nIt was found in Italy on the following lines. An increase of scale could\r\nonly be attained by growth. Growth, to be effective, must not consist\r\nin mere conquest: it must be true expansion, in other words it must\r\nimply permanent occupation. And permanent occupation implied settlement\r\nof the conquering people on the conquered lands. A growing population\r\nof rustic citizens, self-supporting, bound by ties of sentiment and\r\ninterest to the state of which they were citizens, conscious of a duty\r\nto uphold the state to which they owed their homesteads and their\r\nsecurity, supplied automatically in response to growing needs the\r\ngrowing raw material of power. Nor was Roman expansion confined to the\r\nassignation of land-allotments to individuals (_viritim_). Old towns\r\nwere remodelled, and new ones founded, under various conditions as\r\nsettlements (_coloniae_). Each settler in one of these towns received an\r\nallotment of land in the territory of the township, and was officially\r\nspeaking a tiller of the soil (_colonus_). The effect of these Colonies\r\nwas twofold. Their territories added to the sum of land in occupation of\r\nRomans or Roman Allies: so far the gain was chiefly material. But they\r\nwere all bound to Rome and subjected to Roman influences. In their turn\r\nthey influenced the conquered peoples among whom they were planted, and\r\npromoted slowly and steadily the Romanizing of Italy. Being fortified,\r\nthey had a military value from the first, as commanding roads and as\r\nbases of campaigns. But their moral effect in accustoming Italians to\r\nregard Rome as the controlling centre of Italy was perhaps of even\r\ngreater importance.\r\n\r\nWe must not ignore or underrate the advantages of Rome’s position from a\r\ncommercial point of view. Little though we hear of this in tradition, it\r\ncan hardly be doubted that it gave Rome a marked superiority in resources\r\nto her less happily situated neighbours, and enabled her to take the\r\nfirst great step forward by becoming dominant in central Italy. But the\r\nconsolidation and completion of her conquest of the peninsula was carried\r\nout by means of an extended Roman agriculture. It was this that gave to\r\nRoman expansion the solid character that distinguished republican Rome\r\nfrom other conquering powers. What she took, that she could keep. When\r\nthe traditional story of early Rome depicts the Roman commons as hungry\r\nfor land, and annexation of territory as the normal result of conquest,\r\nit is undoubtedly worthy of belief. When it shews us the devastation of\r\ntheir enemies’ lands as a chief part—sometimes the whole—of the work of\r\na campaign, it is in full agreement with the traditions of all ancient\r\nwarfare. When we read[578] that the ruin of farms by raids of the enemy\r\nbrought suffering farmers into debt, and that the cruel operation of\r\ndebt-laws led to serious internal troubles in the Roman state, the story\r\nis credible enough. The superior organization of Rome enabled her to\r\novercome these troubles, not only by compromises and concessions at\r\nhome, but still more by establishing her poorer citizens on farms at the\r\ncost of her neighbours. As the area under her control was extended, the\r\nmilitary force automatically grew, and she surpassed her rivals in the\r\ncohesion and vitality of her power. At need, her armies rose from the\r\nsoil. So did those of other Italian peoples. But in dealing with them she\r\nenjoyed the advantage of unity as compared with the far less effective\r\ncooperation of Samnite cantons or Etruscan cities. Even the capture\r\nof Rome by the Gauls could not destroy her system, and she was able\r\nto strengthen her moral position by proving herself the one competent\r\ndefender of Italy against invasion from the North. When the time came\r\nfor the struggle with Carthage, she had to face a different test. But no\r\nblundering on the part of her generals, no strategy of Hannibal, could\r\navail to nullify the solid superiority of her military strength. And this\r\nstrength was in the last resort derived from the numbers and loyalty of\r\nthe farm-population: it was in fact the product of the plough rather than\r\nthe sword.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural conditions of early Rome[579] are a subject, and have\r\nbeen the subject, of special treatises. Only a few points can be noticed\r\nhere. That a communal system of some kind once existed, whether in the\r\nform of the associations known to inquirers as Village Communities or\r\non a gentile basis as Clan-estates, is a probable hypothesis. But the\r\nevidence for it is slight, and, however just the general inferences\r\nmay be, they can hardly be said to help us much in considering the\r\nlabour-question. It may well be true that lands[580] were held by clans,\r\nthat they were cultivated in common, that the produce was divided among\r\nthe households, that parcels of the land were granted to the dependants\r\n(_clientes_) of the clan as tenants at will (_precario_) on condition\r\nof paying a share of their crops. Or it may be that the normal unit was\r\na village in which the members were several freeholders of small plots,\r\nwith common rights over the undivided common-land, the waste left free\r\nfor grazing and miscellaneous uses. And it is possible that at some stage\r\nor other of social development both these systems may have existed side\r\nby side. In later times we find Rome the mistress of a vast territory in\r\nItaly, a large part of which was reserved as state-domain (_ager publicus\r\npopuli Romani_), the mismanagement of which was a source of grave\r\nevils. But in Rome’s early days there cannot have been any great amount\r\nof such domain-land. That there was land-hunger, a demand for several\r\nallotments in full ownership, on which a family might live, is not to be\r\ndoubted. And the formation of communities, each with its village centre\r\nand its common pasture, was a very natural means to promote mutual help\r\nand protection. That men so situated worked with their own hands, and\r\nthat the labour was mainly (and often wholly) that of the father and his\r\nfamily, is as nearly certain as such a proposition can be. But this does\r\nnot imply or suggest that no slave-labour was employed on the farms.\r\nIt merely means that farms were not worked on a system in which all\r\nmanual labour was performed by slaves. We have to inquire what is the\r\ntraditional picture of agricultural conditions in the early days of Rome,\r\nand how far that picture is worthy of our belief.\r\n\r\nNow it so happens that, three striking figures stand out in the\r\ntraditional picture of the Roman farmer-soldiers of the early\r\nRepublic. Others fill in certain details, but the names of Lucius\r\nQuinctius Cincinnatus, Manius Curius Dentatus, and Gaius Fabricius\r\nLuscinus, were especially notable in Roman legend as representing the\r\nstrenuous patriotic and frugal lives of the heroes of old. The story\r\nof Cincinnatus[581] is told by Cicero Livy Dionysius and Pliny the\r\nelder, and often referred to by other writers. The hero is a Patrician\r\nof the old simple frugal patriotic masterful type, the admiration and\r\nimitation of which these edifying legends seek to encourage. He had\r\nowned seven _iugera_ of land, but had been driven to pledge or sell\r\nthree of these[582] in order to provide bail for his son, who had been\r\nbrought to trial for disturbance of the public peace and had sought\r\nsafety in flight. The forfeit imposed on the father left him with only\r\nfour _iugera_. This little farm, on the further side of the Tiber, he\r\nwas cultivating, when deputies from the Senate came to announce that\r\nhe had been named Dictator to deal with a great emergency. They found\r\nhim digging or ploughing, covered with dust and sweat: and he would not\r\nreceive them till he had washed and gowned himself. Then he heard their\r\nmessage, took up the duties of the supreme office, and of course saved\r\nthe state. It is to be noted that he chose as his Master of the Horse\r\n(the Dictator’s understudy) a man of the same[583] sort, Patrician by\r\nbirth, poor, but a stout warrior. We may fairly suspect that a definite\r\nmoral purpose has been at work, modelling and colouring this pretty\r\nstory. In a later age, when the power of moneyed interests was overriding\r\nthe prestige of Patrician blood, the reaction of an ‘old-Roman’ party\r\nwas long a vigorous force in Roman life, as we see from the career of\r\nthe elder Cato. Cato was a Plebeian, but any Plebeian who admired the\r\nsimple ways of early Rome was bound to recognize that Patricians were the\r\nnobility of the olden time.\r\n\r\nNow the fact of Cincinnatus working with his own hands is the one\r\nmaterial point in the story. We need not doubt that there were many such\r\nmen, and that a name (perhaps correct) was necessary in order to keep\r\nthe story current and to impress later generations with the virtues of\r\ntheir ancestors. But, if the man had under him a slave or slaves, the\r\nfact would be quite unimportant for the purpose of the legend. Therefore\r\nit is no wonder that the versions of the story in general say nothing\r\nof slaves. It is more remarkable that in the version of Dionysius we\r\nread that Cincinnatus, after selling off most of his property to meet\r\nthe liabilities incurred through his son, ‘kept for himself one small\r\nfarm beyond the Tiber, on which there was a mean cabin: there he was\r\nliving a life of toil and hardship, tilling the soil with a few slaves.’\r\nThat Dionysius was a rhetorician with an eye for picturesque detail,\r\nand liable to overdraw a picture, is certain: but it is not evident how\r\nthe mention of the slaves is to be accounted for by this tendency. The\r\nimpression of the hero’s poverty and personal labour is rather weakened\r\nby mention of slaves. The writer derived his story from Roman sources.\r\nNow, did the original version include the slaves or not? Did Livy and the\r\nrest leave them out, or did Dionysius put them in? Were they omitted as\r\nuseless or embarrassing for the uses of edifying, or were they casually\r\ninserted owing to the prepossessions of a Greek familiar only with a\r\ndeveloped slave-system, to whom ‘with a few slaves’ would fitly connote\r\npoverty? To answer these questions with confidence is perhaps unwise. But\r\nto me it seems far more likely that Roman writers left the detail out\r\nthan that a Greek student put it in.\r\n\r\nIf the tradition of the early wars is of any value at all, it may give a\r\ngeneral support to this opinion through the frequent references to the\r\nexistence of rustic slavery. The devastation of an enemy’s country is the\r\nnormal occupation of hostile armies. The capture of slaves[584], as of\r\nflocks and herds and beasts of burden, is a common item in the tale of\r\nbooty from the farms. That writers of a later age may have exaggerated\r\nthe slave-element in the farm-labour of early times is highly probable.\r\nThe picturesque was an object, and it was natural to attempt it with\r\nthe use of touches suggested by daily circumstances of the world in\r\nwhich they were living. But that they so completely misrepresented the\r\nconditions of a past age as to foist into the picture so important a\r\nfigure as the slave, without authority or probability, is hardly to be\r\nbelieved, unless there is good reason for thinking that slavery was\r\nunknown in the age and country of which they speak. And the contrary is\r\nthe case. The dawn of Roman history shews us a people already advanced\r\nin civilization to the stage of family and clan organization, and the\r\ntradition allows for the presence of the slave in the _familia_ from the\r\nfirst. True, he does not appear as the despised human chattel of later\r\ntimes, but as a man whom misfortune has placed in bondage. His master\r\nis aware that fortune may turn, and that his bondman is quite capable\r\nof resuming his former position if restored in freedom to his native\r\nhome. The slave seems to be normally an Italian[585], a captive in some\r\nwar; he may have passed by sale from one owner to another. But he is\r\nnot a mere foreign animal, good bad or indifferent, a doubtful purchase\r\nfrom a roguish dealer. He bears a name[586] that connects him with his\r\nmaster, _Publipor Lucipor Marcipor Olipor_ and so on, formed by adding\r\nthe suffix _por_ to the forename of Publius Lucius Marcus or Aulus. But,\r\ngranting that all households might include a slave or two, and that many\r\nso did, also that agriculture was a common and honourable pursuit,—is\r\nit likely that a farming owner would himself plough or dig and leave\r\nhis slave[587] to look on? I conclude therefore that the age was one in\r\nwhich agriculture prevailed and that the ordinary farmer worked himself\r\nand employed slave-labour side by side with his own so far as his means\r\nallowed. All was on a small scale. Passages of Livy or Dionysius that\r\nimply the presence of great slave-gangs, and desertions on a large scale\r\nin time of war are falsely coloured by ‘anticipation’ of phenomena well\r\nknown from the experience of more recent times. But, on however small a\r\nscale, slavery was there. Until there came an impulse of an ‘industrial’\r\nkind, prompting men to engage in wholesale production for a large market,\r\nthe slave remained essentially a domestic, bearing a considerable share\r\nof the family labours, whatever the nature of those labours might be.\r\n\r\nAs there is no difficulty in believing that Cincinnatus and others\r\nof his type in the fifth century BC worked with slaves beside them,\r\nso it is evident that Curius and Fabricius in the first half of the\r\nthird century are meant to illustrate the same frugal life and solid\r\npatriotism. In both cases the story lays particular stress on the\r\nhero’s incorruptibility and cheerful endurance of poverty. A well-known\r\nscene[588] represents Curius at his rustic villa eating a dinner of\r\nherbs and refusing a gift of gold from Samnite ambassadors. He is an\r\nhonest farmer-citizen of the good old sort. Fabricius is another, famed\r\nespecially for his calm defiance of the threats and cajolery of Pyrrhus,\r\nand impervious to bribes. Both these traditions received much legendary\r\ncolouring in course of time. The passage bearing most directly on my\r\npresent inquiry is a fragment[589] of Dionysius, in which Fabricius is\r\nspurning the offers of king Pyrrhus, who is very anxious to secure the\r\ngood man’s services as his chief minister on liberal terms. He says ‘nor\r\nneed I tell you of my poverty, that I have but a very small plot of\r\nland with a mean cottage, and that I get my living neither from money\r\nat interest (ἀπὸ δανεισμάτων) nor from slaves (ἀπ’ ἀνδραπόδων).’ Below\r\nhe declares that living under Roman conditions he holds himself a happy\r\nman, ‘for with industry and thrift I find my poor little farm sufficient\r\nto provide me with necessaries.’ And his constitution (φύσις) does not\r\nconstrain him to hanker after unnecessary things. Here we have a good\r\nspecimen of the moral stories with which the later rhetoricians edified\r\ntheir readers. But what does ‘from slaves’ mean? Is Fabricius denying\r\nthat he employs slave-labour on his farm? If so, I confess that I do\r\nnot believe the denial as being his own genuine utterance. I take it to\r\nbe put into his mouth by Dionysius, writing under the influence of the\r\nagricultural conditions of a much later time, when great slaveowners drew\r\nlarge incomes from the exploitation of slave-labour on great estates. But\r\nI am not sure that Dionysius means him to be saying more than ‘I am not\r\na big capitalist farming on a large scale by slave-gangs.’ How far this\r\nwriter really understood the state of things in the third century BC,\r\nis hard to say. In any case he is repeating what he has picked up from\r\nearlier writers and not letting it suffer in the repetition. Taken by\r\nhimself, he is no more a sufficient witness to the practice of Fabricius\r\nthan to that of Cincinnatus. That there was slavery is certain: that\r\nFabricius had scruples against employing slaves is hardly credible.\r\n\r\nIn the ages during which Rome gradually won her way to the headship of\r\nItaly the Roman citizen was normally both farmer and soldier: the soldier\r\ngenerally a man called up from his farm for a campaign, the farmer of\r\nmilitary age always potentially a soldier. This state of things was\r\nevidently not peculiar to Rome. What makes it striking in the case of\r\nRome is the well-considered system by which the military machine was kept\r\nin working order. The development of fortress colonies and extension\r\nof roads gave to Roman farmers in the border-lands more security than\r\nany neighbouring power could give to its own citizens on its own side\r\nof the border. Mobilization was more prompt and effective on the Roman\r\nside under a central control: the fortresses served as a hindrance to\r\nhostile invaders, as refuges to the rustics at need, and as bases for\r\nRoman armies. It is no great stretch of imagination to see in this\r\norganization a reason for the prosperity of Roman agriculture. Farms\r\nwere no doubt laid waste on both sides of the border, but the balance of\r\nthe account was in the long run favourable to Rome. Among the numerous\r\nlegends that gathered round the name of king Pyrrhus is a story[590] that\r\nin reply to some discontent on the part of his Italian allies, to whom\r\nhis strategy seemed over-cautious, he said ‘the mere look of the country\r\nshews me the great difference between you and the Romans. In the parts\r\nsubject to them are all manner of fruit-trees and vineyards: the land\r\nis cultivated and the farm-establishments are costly: but the estates\r\nof my friends are so laid waste that all signs of human occupation have\r\ndisappeared.’ The saying may be not authentic or merely overdrawn in\r\nrhetorical transmission. But it probably contains the outlines of a true\r\npicture of the facts. It was the power of giving to her farmer-settlers a\r\nmore effective protection than her rivals could give to their own farmers\r\nthat enabled Rome to advance steadily and continuously. The organization\r\nwas simple enough: the sword was ready to guard the plough, and the\r\nplough to occupy and hold the conquests of the sword.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the first Punic war we have a remarkable story relating\r\nto M Atilius Regulus, the man around whose name so much patriotic legend\r\ngathered. He appears as one of the good old farmer-heroes. His farm[591]\r\nof seven _iugera_ lay in an unhealthy part of the country, and the soil\r\nwas poor. His advice to agriculturists, not to buy good land in an\r\nunhealthy district nor bad land in a healthy one, was handed down as the\r\nopinion of a qualified judge. We are told[592] that after his victory\r\nin Africa he desired to be relieved and return home; but the Senate did\r\nnot send out another commander, and so he had to stay on. He wrote and\r\ncomplained of his detention. Among other reasons he urged in particular\r\nhis domestic anxiety. In the epitome of Livy XVIII this appears as\r\n‘that his little farm had been abandoned by the hired men.’ In Valerius\r\nMaximus[593] we find a fuller account, thus ‘that the steward in charge\r\nof his little farm (seven _iugera_ in the _Pupinia_) had died, and the\r\nhired man (_mercennarium_) had taken the opportunity to decamp, taking\r\nwith him the farm-stock: therefore he asked them to relieve him of his\r\ncommand, for he feared his wife and children would have nothing to live\r\non now the farm was abandoned.’ On hearing this, the Senate ordered\r\nthat provision should at once be made at the cost of the state (_a_)\r\nfor cultivation of his farm[594] by contract (_b_) for maintenance of\r\nhis wife and children (_c_) for making good the losses he had suffered.\r\nThe reference of Pliny[595] rather confirms the details of Valerius,\r\nwho by himself is not a very satisfactory witness. Livy is probably the\r\nsource of all these versions. They are part of the Roman tradition of\r\nthe first Punic war. Polybius, whose narrative is from another line of\r\ntradition, says not a word of this story. Indeed, he declares[596] that\r\nRegulus, so far from wishing to be relieved, wanted to stay on, fearing\r\nthat he might hand over the credit of a final victory to a successor. The\r\ntwo traditions cannot be reconciled as they stand. Probably neither is\r\ncomplete. If we suppose the account of Polybius to be true, it does not\r\nfollow as a matter of course that the other story is a baseless fiction.\r\nIn any case, the relation of Regulus to the agriculture of his day, as\r\nrepresented by the story, seemed credible to Romans of a later age, and\r\ndeserves serious consideration.\r\n\r\nWe are told that in the middle of the third century BC a man of such\r\nposition and recognized merit that he was specially chosen to fill the\r\nplace of a deceased consul in the course of a great war was a farmer on\r\nan estate of seven _iugera_, from which he was supporting his wife and\r\nfamily. In his absence on public duty he had left the farm in charge\r\nof a _vilicus_. The only reference to the labour employed there speaks\r\nof hired men (wage-earners, _mercennarii_). It does not say that there\r\nwere no slaves. But the natural inference is that the _vilicus_ had the\r\ncontrol of a staff consisting wholly or largely of free labourers. Now\r\nthat a slave _vilicus_ might in the ordinary run of business be left\r\nin control of labourers, slave or free, seems clear from directions\r\ngiven by Cato[597] in the next century. The _vilicus_ in this story was\r\ntherefore probably a slave, as they were generally if not always. His\r\ndeath left the hired men uncontrolled, and they took the opportunity\r\nof robbing their employer. Roused by the absent consul’s complaints\r\n(whether accompanied by a request for relief or not), the Senate took up\r\nthe matter and arranged to secure him against loss. We do not hear of\r\nthe punishment of the dishonest hirelings, or even of a search for them.\r\nThis may be merely an omitted detail: at any rate they had probably left\r\nthe neighbourhood. The curious thing is that we hear nothing of the wife\r\nof Regulus: that a Roman matron submitted tamely to such treatment is\r\nhard to believe. Was it she who made the complaints and set the Senate\r\nin motion? The general outcome of the story is a conclusion that hired\r\nlabour was freely employed in this age, not to exclusion of slave labour,\r\nbut combined with it: that is, that the wage-earning work of landless\r\nmen, such as appears in the earlier traditions, still went on. It was not\r\nyet overlaid by the plantation-system, and degraded by the associations\r\nof the slave-gang and the _ergastulum_.\r\n\r\nWhen we pass on to the second Punic war, of which we have a fuller and\r\nless legendary record, we find the circumstances somewhat changed, but\r\nthe importance of the Roman farmer’s grip of the land is recognized\r\nas clearly as before. It is not unlikely that since the time of the\r\nPyrrhic war the practise of large-scale farming with slave-labour had\r\nbegun to appear[598] in Italy, but it can hardly as yet have been\r\nwidespread. Large or small, the farms in a large part of the country\r\nhad suffered from the ravages of Hannibal, and it would be the land of\r\nRomans and their faithful allies that suffered most. Many rustics had\r\nto seek shelter in walled towns, above all in Rome, and their presence\r\nwas no doubt in many ways embarrassing. Naturally, as the failure of\r\nHannibal became manifest, the Roman Senate was desirous of restoring\r\nthese refugees to the land and relieving the pressure on the city. Livy,\r\ndrawing no doubt from an earlier annalist, tells us[599] that in 206\r\nBC the Senate instructed the consuls, before they left for the seat of\r\nwar, to undertake the bringing back of the common folk (_plebis_) on\r\nto the land. They pointed out that this was desirable, and possible\r\nunder the better conditions now prevailing. ‘But it was for the people\r\n(_populo_) not at all an easy matter; for the free farmers (_cultoribus_)\r\nhad perished in the war, there was a shortage of slaves (_inopia\r\nservitiorum_), the live stock had been carried off, and the farmsteads\r\n(_villis_) wrecked or burnt. Yet under pressure from the consuls a good\r\nmany did go back to the land.’ He adds that what had raised the question\r\nat this particular juncture was the appeal of a deputation from Placentia\r\nand Cremona. These two Latin colonies, founded twelve years before as\r\nfortresses to hold the region of the Po, had suffered from Gaulish\r\nraids and had no longer a sufficient population, many settlers having\r\ngone off elsewhere. The Roman commander in the district was charged to\r\nprovide for their protection, and the truant colonists ordered to return\r\nto their posts. It was evidently thought that with full numbers and\r\nmilitary support there would be an end to the derelict condition of their\r\nterritories, and that the two colonies would soon revive.\r\n\r\nThis attempt to reestablish the rustic population lays stress upon the\r\ngeneral identity of farmer and soldier and the disturbance of agriculture\r\nby the ravages of war. But most notable is the mention of the shortage\r\nof slave-labour as a hindrance to resumption of work on derelict farms.\r\nIt has been held[600] that this clause refers only to large estates\r\nworked by slave-gangs, while the free farmers stand for the men on small\r\nholdings, who presumably employed no slaves. Now it is quite conceivable\r\nthat this contrast may have been in Livy’s mind as he wrote in the days\r\nof Augustus. That it was the meaning of the older author from whom he\r\ntook the facts is not an equally probable inference. No doubt lack of\r\nslaves would hinder or prevent the renewal of tillage on a big estate.\r\nBut what of a small farm whose owner had fallen in the war? The absence\r\nof the father in the army would be a most serious blow to the efficient\r\nworking of the farm. If the raids of the enemy drove his family to take\r\nrefuge in Rome, and the farm was let down to weeds, more labour than\r\never would be needed to renew cultivation. When there was no longer\r\nany hope of his return, the supply of sufficient labour was the only\r\nchance of reviving the farm. Surely there must have been many cases in\r\nwhich the help of one or two slaves was the obvious means of supplying\r\nit. Therefore, if we recognize that slave-labour had long been a common\r\ninstitution in Roman households, we shall not venture to assert that only\r\nlarge estates are referred to. That such estates, worked by slave-gangs,\r\nwere numerous in 206 BC, is not likely: that small farmers often (not\r\nalways) eked out their own labour with the help of a slave, is far more\r\nso. The actual shortage of slaves[601] had been partly brought about by\r\nthe employment of many in military service. Some had no doubt simply run\r\naway. And the period of great foreign conquests and a full slave-market\r\nhad yet to come.\r\n\r\nI do not venture to dispute that the accumulation of capital in the\r\nform of ready money available for speculation in state leases, farming\r\nof revenues, and other contracts, had already begun at Rome in the age\r\nof the great Punic wars. In the second war, contracts for the supply of\r\nnecessaries to the armed forces played a considerable part, and we hear\r\nof contractors[602] who practised shameless frauds on the state. Greed\r\nwas a plant that throve in the soil of Roman life: the scandals of the\r\nlater Republic were merely the sinister developments of an old tendency\r\nfavoured by opportunities. Land-grabbing in particular was, if consistent\r\ntradition may be believed, from early times a passion of Roman nobles:\r\nand the effect of a law[603] forbidding them to become ship-owners and\r\nengage in commerce was to concentrate their enterprise on the acquisition\r\nof great landed estates. Another notable fact is the large voluntary\r\nloans[604] which the government was able to raise in the critical period\r\nof the great war. In the year 210, when the financial strain was extreme,\r\na very large contribution of the kind took place. In 204 the Senate\r\narranged a scheme[605] for repayment in three instalments. In 200 the\r\nlenders, apparently alarmed by the delay in paying the second instalment,\r\nbecame clamorous. The Punic war was at an end, and war with Philip of\r\nMacedon just declared: they wanted to get their money back. We are\r\ntold[606] that the state was not able to find the cash, and that the cry\r\nof many creditors was ‘there are plenty of farms for sale, and we want\r\nto buy.’ The Senate devised a middle way of satisfying them. They were\r\nto be offered the chance of acquiring the state domain-land within fifty\r\nmiles of Rome at a valuation fixed by the consuls. This seems to mean,\r\nup to the amount of the instalment then in question. But they were not\r\nthereby to receive the land in full private[607] property. A quit-rent of\r\none _as_ was to be set on each _iugerum_, in evidence that the property\r\nstill belonged to the state. Thus, when the state finances should admit,\r\nthey might get back their ready money if they preferred it and give back\r\nthe land to the state. The offer was gladly accepted, and the land taken\r\nover on these terms was called ‘third-part land’ (_trientabulum_) as\r\nrepresenting ⅓ of the money lent. The final instalment appears to have\r\nbeen paid in cash[608] in the year 196.\r\n\r\nThat these patriotic creditors were men with a keen eye for a bargain,\r\nand that they made a good one in the above arrangement, is pretty clear.\r\nThis is the only occasion on which we hear of the _trientabula_ plan\r\nof settling a money claim by what was in effect a perpetual lease at\r\na nominal rent terminable by reconversion into a money claim at the\r\npleasure of the lessee. No doubt the valuation was so made as to give\r\nthe creditor a good margin of security over and above the sum secured.\r\nThere was therefore no temptation to call for the cash and surrender the\r\nland. From the reference[609] to _trientabula_ in the agrarian law of 111\r\nBC it would seem that some at least of these beneficial tenancies were\r\nstill in existence after the lapse of nearly 90 years. They would pass\r\nby inheritance or sale as the ordinary _possessiones_ of state domains\r\ndid, and eventually become merged in the private properties that were the\r\nfinal result of the land-legislation of the revolutionary age. For the\r\ncapitalists, already powerful in 200 BC, became more and more powerful as\r\ntime went on. And this use of public land to discharge public debts was\r\nundoubtedly a step tending to promote the formation of the great estates\r\n(_latifundia_) which were the ruin of the wholesome old land-system in\r\na great part of Italy. With this tendency the wholesale employment of\r\nslave-labour went hand in hand.\r\n\r\nBut we must not forget that the creditors in 200 BC are made to press for\r\ntheir money on the ground that they wanted to invest it in land, of which\r\nthere was plenty then in the market. This may be a detail added by Livy\r\nhimself: but surely it is more likely that he is repeating what he found\r\nin his authorities. In any case the land referred to can hardly be other\r\nthan the derelict farms belonging to those who had suffered by the war.\r\nIn earlier times we have traditions of men losing their lands through\r\ninability to pay the debts for which they stood pledged. In a somewhat\r\nlater time we hear[610] of small farmers being bought out cheaply by\r\nneighbouring big landlords, and bullied if they made difficulty about\r\nleaving their farms. The present case is different, arising directly\r\nout of the war. The father of a family might be dead, or disinclined to\r\ngo back to monotonous toil after the excitements of military life, or\r\nunable to find the extra labour for reclaiming a wasted and weed-grown\r\nfarm, or means of restocking it. He or his heir would probably not have\r\ncapital to tide him over the interval before the farm was again fully\r\nproductive: his immediate need was probably ready money. No wonder that\r\nfarms were in the market, and at prices that made a land-grabber’s\r\nmouth water. The great war certainly marked a stage in the decay of the\r\nsmall-farm agriculture, the healthy condition of which had hitherto been\r\nthe soundest element of Roman strength.\r\n\r\nBefore we leave the traditions of the early period it is necessary to\r\nrefer to the question of free wage-earning labour. Have we any reason to\r\nthink that under the conditions of early Rome there was any considerable\r\nclass of rustic[611] wage-earners? Nearly all the passages that suggest\r\nan affirmative answer are found in the work of Dionysius, who repeatedly\r\nuses[612] the Greek word θητεύειν of this class of labour. It is\r\nrepresented as being practically servile, for it meant working with\r\nslaves or at least doing the work which according to the writer[613] was\r\n(even in the regal period) done by slaves. The poor Plebeians appear as\r\nloathing such service: their desire is for plots of land on which each\r\nman can work freely for himself. This desire their protectors, kings\r\nor tribunes, endeavour to gratify by allotments as occasion serves.\r\nNow that there was land-hunger from the earliest times, and that\r\nagriculture was in itself an honourable trade, we have no good reason\r\nfor doubting. But that the dislike of wage-earning labour as such was\r\nthe main motive of land-hunger is a more doubtful proposition. It may\r\nbe true, but it sounds very like an explanation supplied by a learned\r\nbut rhetorical historian. We know that Dionysius regarded Rome as a city\r\nof Greek origin. The legends of early Attica were doubtless familiar\r\nto him. We may grant that there was probably some likeness between the\r\nlabour-conditions of early Rome and early Athens. But historians are ever\r\ntempted to detect analogies in haste and remodel tradition at leisure.\r\nI suspect that the two features of the same picture, the prevalence of\r\nrustic slavery and also of rustic wage-earning, are taken from different\r\nlines of tradition, and both overdrawn.\r\n\r\nIn connexion with this question it is necessary to turn back to a\r\nremarkable passage[614] of Livy referring to the year 362 BC. The famous\r\nL Manlius the martinet (_imperiosus_) was threatened with a public\r\nprosecution by a tribune for misuse of his powers as dictator in the\r\nyear just past. To create prejudice against the accused, the prosecutor\r\nfurther alleged that he had treated his son Titus with cruel severity.\r\nThe young man was slow of wit and speech, but no wrongdoing had been\r\nbrought home to him. Yet his father had turned him out of his city home,\r\nhad cut him off from public life and the company of other youths, and put\r\nhim to servile work, shutting him up in what was almost a slaves’ prison\r\n(_ergastulum_). The daily affliction of such a life was calculated to\r\nteach the dictator’s son that he had indeed a martinet for his father.\r\nTo keep his son among the flocks in the rustic condition and habit of a\r\ncountry boor was to intensify any natural defects of his own offspring,\r\nconduct too heartless for even the brute beasts. But the young Manlius\r\nupset all calculations. On hearing what was in contemplation he started\r\nfor Rome with a knife, made his way into the tribune’s presence in the\r\nmorning and made him solemnly swear to drop the prosecution by a threat\r\nof killing him then and there if he did not take the oath. The tribune\r\nswore, and the trial fell through. The Roman commons were vexed to lose\r\nthe chance of using their votes to punish the father for his arbitrary\r\nand unfeeling conduct, but they approved the dutiful act of the son, and\r\ntook the first opportunity of electing him a military officer. This young\r\nman was afterwards the renowned T Manlius Torquatus, who followed his\r\nfather’s example of severity by putting to death his own son for a breach\r\nof military discipline.\r\n\r\nThe story is a fine specimen of the edifying legends kept in circulation\r\nby the Romans of later days. That the greatness of Rome was above all\r\nthings due to their grim old fathers who endured hardness and sacrificed\r\nall tender affections to public duty, was the general moral of these\r\npopular tales. Exaggeration grew with repetition, and details became\r\nless and less authentic. In particular the circumstances of their own\r\ntime were foisted in by narrators whose imagination did not suffice to\r\ngrasp the difference of conditions in the past. In the above story we\r\nhave a reference to _ergastula_, the barracoons in which the slave-gangs\r\non great estates were confined when not actually at work. Now the\r\nsystem of which these private prisons were a marked feature certainly\r\nbelongs to a later period, when agriculture on a large scale was widely\r\npractised, not to make a living for a man and his family, but to make a\r\ngreat income for a single individual by the labour of many. Here then\r\nwe have a detail clearly not authentic, which throws doubt on the whole\r\nsetting of the story. Again, we have agricultural labour put before us\r\nas degrading (_opus servile_). It is a punishment, banishing a young\r\nRoman from his proper surrounding in the life of Rome, and dooming\r\nhim to grow up a mere clodhopper. There may have been some points in\r\nthe original story of which this is an exaggerated version: for it is\r\nevident that from quite early days of the Republic men of the ruling\r\nclass found it necessary to spend much time in or quite close to the\r\ncity. But the representation of agriculture as a servile occupation is\r\ngrossly inconsistent with the other legends glorifying the farmer-heroes\r\nof yore. It is of course quite impossible to prove that no isolated cases\r\nof a young Roman’s banishment to farm life ever occurred. But that such\r\na proceeding was so far ordinary as fairly to be reckoned typical, is\r\nin the highest degree improbable. That later writers should invent or\r\naccept such colouring for their picture, is no wonder. In the Attic New\r\nComedy, with which Roman society was familiarized[615] in the second\r\ncentury BC, this situation was found. The later conditions of Roman life,\r\nin city and country, tended to make the view of agriculture as a servile\r\ntrade, capable of being rendered penal, more and more intelligible to\r\nRomans. Accordingly we find this view cynically accepted[616] by Sallust,\r\nand warmly protested against[617] by Cicero. In order to weaken the\r\ncase of his client Sextus Roscius, it was urged that the young man’s\r\nfather distrusted him and sent him to live the life of a boor on his\r\nfarm in Umbria. Cicero, evidently anxious as to the possible effect of\r\nthis construction of facts on the coming verdict, was at great pains\r\nto counter it by maintaining that the father’s decision was in truth a\r\ncompliment: in looking for an honest and capable manager of his rustic\r\nestate he had found the right man in this son. The orator surely did\r\nnot enlarge on this point for nothing. And it is to be noted that in\r\ninsisting on the respectability of a farmer’s life he sees fit to refer\r\nto the farmer-consuls of the olden time. He feels, no doubt, that\r\nunsupported assertions[618] as to the employment of sons in agriculture\r\nby his contemporaries were not likely to carry much weight with the jury.\r\n\r\nAfter the above considerations I come to the conclusion that Livy’s\r\nrepresentation of agriculture as a servile occupation in the case\r\nof Manlius is a coloured utterance of no historical value. A minute\r\nconsistency is not to be looked for in the writings of an author to whom\r\npicturesqueness of detail appeals differently at different moments. For\r\nLivy was in truth deeply conscious of the sad changes in Italian country\r\nlife brought about by the transition to large-scale agriculture. Under\r\nthe year 385 he is driven to moralize[619] on the constant renewal of\r\nVolscian and Aequian wars. How ever did these two small peoples find\r\narmies for the long-continued struggle? He suggests possible answers\r\nto the question, the most significant of which is that in those days\r\nthere was a dense free population in those districts,—districts which in\r\nhis own time, he says, would be deserted but for the presence of Roman\r\nslaves. To describe vividly the decay of free population, he adds that\r\nonly a poor little nursery of soldiers is left (_vix seminario exiguo\r\nmilitum relicto_) in those parts. The momentous results of the change\r\nof system are not more clearly grasped by Lucan or Pliny himself. Livy\r\nthen is not to be cited as a witness to the existence of great numbers of\r\nrustic slaves in Italy before the second Punic war, nor even then for the\r\nhighly-organized gang-system by which an industrial character was given\r\nto agriculture.\r\n\r\nOne more story, and a strange one, needs to be considered, for it\r\nbears directly on the labour-question. The time in which it is placed\r\nis the latter part of the period of the Roman conquest of Italy. In\r\na fragment[620] of one of his later books Dionysius tells us of the\r\narbitrary doings of a consul Postumius, a Patrician of high rank who had\r\nalready been twice consul. After much bullying he made his colleague, a\r\nPlebeian of recent nobility, resign to him the command in the Samnite\r\nwar. This was an unpopular act, but he went on to worse. From his\r\narmy he drafted some 2000 men on to his own estate, and set them to\r\ncut away brushwood without providing cutting tools (ἄνευ σιδήρου).\r\nAnd he kept them there a long time doing the work of wage-earners or\r\nslaves (θητῶν ἔργα καὶ θεραπόντων ὑπηρετοῦντας). Into the tale of his\r\nfurther acts of arbitrary insolence we need not enter here, nor into\r\nthe public prosecution and condemnation to a heavy fine that awaited\r\nhim at the end of his term of office. Suffice it that the story is in\r\ngeneral confirmed[621] by Livy, and that the hero of it seems to have\r\nbeen remembered in Roman tradition as a classic instance of self-willed\r\naudacity and disregard of the conventions that were the soul of Roman\r\npublic life. So far as the labour is concerned, it seems to me that what\r\nwas objected to in the consul’s conduct was the use of his military\r\nsupreme power (_imperium_) for his own private profit. He treated a\r\nfatigue-party as a farm labour-gang. Freemen might work on their own land\r\nside by side with their slaves: they might work for wages on another\r\nman’s land side by side with his slaves. Any objection they might feel\r\nwould be due to the unwelcome pressure of economic necessity. But to\r\nbe called out for military service (and in most cases from their own\r\nfarms), and then set to farm-labour on another man’s land under military\r\ndiscipline, was too much. We must bear in mind that a Roman army of the\r\nearly Republic was not composed of pauper adventurers who preferred a\r\nlife of danger with hopes of loot and licence to hard monotonous toil.\r\nThe very poor were not called out, and the ranks were filled with\r\ncitizens who had at least some property to lose. Therefore it might\r\neasily happen that a soldier set to rough manual labour by Postumius had\r\nto do for him the service that was being done at home for himself by a\r\nwage-earner or a slave. He was a soldier because he was a free citizen;\r\nhe was being employed in place of a slave because he was a soldier under\r\nmartial law. In no free republic could such a wrong be tolerated. The\r\nwords of the epitome of Livy state the case with sufficient precision. _L\r\nPostumius consularis, quoniam cum exercitui praeesset opera militum in\r\nagro suo usus erat, damnatus est._ It is remarkable that, among the other\r\nepitomators and collectors of anecdotes who drew from the store of Livy,\r\nnot one, not even Valerius Maximus, records this story. To Livy it must\r\nhave seemed important, or he would not have laid enough stress on it to\r\nattract the attention of the writer of the epitome. So too the detailed\r\nversion of Dionysius, probably drawn from the same authority as that of\r\nLivy, struck the fancy of a maker of extracts and caused his text to be\r\npreserved to us. It surely descends, like many other of the old stories,\r\nin a line of Plebeian tradition, and is recorded as an illustration of\r\nthe survival of Patrician insolence in a headstrong consul after the two\r\nOrders had been politically equalized by the Licinian laws.\r\n\r\nBeside these fragments of evidence there are in the later Roman\r\nliterature many passages in which writers directly assert that their\r\nforefathers lived a life of simple frugality and worked with their\r\nown hands on their own little farms. But as evidence the value of\r\nsuch passages is not very great. They testify to a tradition: but in\r\nmost cases the tradition is being used for the purposes of moralizing\r\nrhetoric. Now the glorification of ‘good old times’ has in all ages\r\ntempted authors to aim rather at striking contrast between past and\r\npresent than at verification of their pictures of the past. To impute\r\nthis defect to satirists is a mere commonplace. But those who are not\r\nprofessed satirists are often exposed to the same influence in a less\r\ndegree. The most striking phenomenon in this kind is the chorus of poets\r\nin the Augustan age. The Emperor, aware that the character of Reformer\r\nis never a very popular one, preferred to pose as Restorer. The hint was\r\ngiven, and the literary world acted on it. Henceforth the praises of the\r\nnoble and efficient simplicity of the ancients formed a staple material\r\nof Roman literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI. ABSTRACT OF CONCLUSIONS.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the early period down to 201 BC I think we are justified\r\nin coming to the following conclusions.\r\n\r\n1. The evidence, consisting of fragmentary tradition somewhat distorted\r\nand in some points exaggerated by the influence of moral purpose on later\r\nwriters, is on the whole consistent and credible.\r\n\r\n2. From it we get a picture of agriculture as an honourable trade, the\r\nchief occupation of free citizens, who are in general accustomed to work\r\nwith their own hands.\r\n\r\n3. The Roman citizen as a rule has an allotment of land as his own, and\r\nan early classification of citizens (the ‘Servian Constitution’) was\r\noriginally based on landholding, carrying with it the obligation to\r\nmilitary service.\r\n\r\n4. The Roman family had a place for the slave, and the slave, a domestic\r\nhelper, normally an Italian, was not as yet the despised alien chattel of\r\nwhom we read in a later age.\r\n\r\n5. As a domestic he bore a part in all the labours of the family, and\r\ntherefore as a matter of course in the commonest of all, agriculture.\r\n\r\n6. In this there was nothing degrading. Suggestions to that effect are\r\nthe echoes of later conditions.\r\n\r\n7. Under such relations of master and slave it was quite natural that\r\nmanumission should (as it did) operate to make the slave not only free\r\nbut a citizen. That this rule led to very troublesome results in a later\r\nperiod was owing to change of circumstances.\r\n\r\n8. Slavery then was, from the earliest times of which we have any\r\ntradition, an integral part of the social and economic system, as much\r\nin Italy as in Greece. It was there, and only needed the stimulus of\r\nprospective economic gain for capitalists to organize it on a crudely\r\nindustrial basis, without regard to considerations of humanity or the\r\ngeneral wellbeing of the state.\r\n\r\n9. Of wage-earning labour on the part of freemen we have little trace in\r\ntradition. The reported complaints of day-labour performed for Patrician\r\nnobles in early times are probably not unconnected with the institution\r\nof clientship, and in any case highly coloured by rhetoric.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROME—MIDDLE PERIOD\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII. INTRODUCTORY GENERAL VIEW.\r\n\r\nThe overthrow of Carthage put an end to a period of terrible anxiety\r\nto the Roman government, and the first feeling was naturally one of\r\nrelief. But the sufferings of the war-weary masses had produced an\r\nintense longing for peace and rest. It might be true that a Macedonian\r\nwar was necessary in the interest of the state: but it was only with\r\ngreat difficulty that the Senate overcame opposition to a forward policy.\r\nFor the sufferings of the people, more particularly the farmers, were\r\nnot at an end. The war indemnities from Carthage might refill the empty\r\ntreasury, and enable the state to discharge its public obligations to\r\ncontractors and other creditors. So far well: but receipts of this\r\nkind did little or nothing towards meeting the one vital need, the\r\nreestablishment of displaced peasants on the land. The most accessible\r\ndistricts, generally the best suited for tillage, had no doubt suffered\r\nmost in the disturbances of war; and the future destinies of Rome and\r\nItaly were depending on the form that revival of agriculture would\r\ntake. The race of small farmers had been hitherto the backbone of Roman\r\npower. But the wars of the last two generations had brought Rome into\r\ncontact with an agricultural system of a very different character. Punic\r\nagriculture[622] was industrial: that is, conducted for profit on a large\r\nscale and directed by purely economic considerations. Cheap production\r\nwas the first thing. As the modern large farmer relies on machinery, so\r\nhis ancient predecessor relied on domesticated animals; chiefly on the\r\nanimal with hands, the human slave.\r\n\r\nIt is to be borne in mind that during the second Punic war the Roman\r\npractice of employing contractors for all manner of state services\r\n(_publica_) had been greatly developed. Companies of _publicani_ had\r\nplayed an active part and had thriven on their enterprises. These\r\ncompanies were probably already, as they certainly were in later times,\r\ngreat employers of slaves. In any case they represented a purely\r\nindustrial and commercial view of life, the ‘economic’ as opposed to the\r\n‘national’ set of principles. Their numbers were beyond all doubt greater\r\nthan they had ever been before. With such men the future interests of the\r\nstate would easily be obscured by immediate private interests, selfish\r\nappetite being whetted by the recent taste of profits. If a large\r\nsection of the farmer class seemed in danger of extinction through the\r\nabsorption of their farms in great estates, legislation to prevent it was\r\nnot likely to have the warm support of these capitalists. That financial\r\ninterests were immensely powerful in the later Roman Republic is\r\nuniversally admitted, but I do not think sufficient allowance is made for\r\ntheir influence in the time of exhaustion at the very beginning of the\r\nsecond century BC. The story of the _trientabula_, discussed above, is\r\nalone enough to shew how this influence was at work; and it was surely no\r\nisolated phenomenon. We have therefore reason to believe that many of the\r\nfarmers dispossessed by the war never returned to their former homes, and\r\nwe naturally ask what became of them. Some no doubt were unsettled and\r\nunfitted for the monotonous toil of rustic life by the habits contracted\r\nin campaigning. Such men would find urban idleness, or further military\r\nservice with loot in prospect, more to their taste: some of these would\r\ntry both experiences in turn. We trace their presence in the growth of a\r\ncity mob, and in the enlistment of veterans to give tone and steadiness\r\nto somewhat lukewarm armies in new wars. But it is not to be assumed\r\nthat this element constituted the whole, or even the greater part, of\r\nthose who did not go back to their old farms. The years 200-180 saw the\r\nfoundation of 19 new _coloniae_, and it is reasonable to suppose that\r\nthe _coloni_ included a number of the men unsettled by the great war.\r\nThe group founded in 194-2 were designed to secure the coast of southern\r\nItaly against attack by an Eastern power controlling large fleets. Those\r\nof 189-1 were in the North, the main object being to strengthen the Roman\r\ngrip of Cisalpine Gaul. But already in 198-5 it had been found necessary\r\nto support the colonies on the Po (Placentia and Cremona) against attacks\r\nof the Gauls, and in 190 they were reinforced with contingents of fresh\r\ncolonists. For the firm occupation of northern Italy was a policy\r\nsteadily kept in view, and only interrupted for a time by the strain of\r\nEastern wars.\r\n\r\nIn trying to form a notion of the condition of agriculture in the second\r\ncentury BC, and particularly of the labour question, we must never\r\nlose sight of the fact that military service was still obligatory[623]\r\non the Roman citizen, and that this was a period of many wars. The\r\nfarmer-soldier, liable to be called up at any time until his forty-sixth\r\nyear, might have to break off important work which could not without\r\nrisk of loss be left in other hands. At the worst, a sudden call might\r\nmean ruin. Pauper wage-earners, landless men, were not reached by the\r\nmilitary levy in the ordinary way. How soon they began to be enrolled\r\nas volunteers, and to what extent, is uncertain. But conscription of\r\nqualified citizens remained the staple method of filling the legions[624]\r\nuntil the famous levy held by Marius in 107. Conscription had for a long\r\ntime been becoming more and more unpopular and difficult to enforce,\r\nsave in cases where easy victory and abundant booty were looked for. The\r\nRoman government fell into the habit of employing chiefly the contingents\r\nof the Italian Allies in hard and unremunerative campaigns. This unfair\r\ntreatment, and other wrongs to match, led to the great rebellion of 90\r\nBC. But the grant of the Roman franchise to the Italians, extorted by\r\nforce of arms, though it made more Roman citizens, could not make more\r\nRoman farmers. The truth is, a specializing process was going on. The\r\nsoldier was becoming more and more a professional: farming was becoming\r\nmore and more the organized exploitation of labour. Long and distant\r\nwars unfitted the discharged soldiers for the monotonous round of rustic\r\nlife: while they kept the slave-market well supplied with captives,\r\nthus making it easy for capitalists to take advantage of great areas of\r\nland cheaply acquired from time to time. Moreover, the advance of Roman\r\ndominion had another effect beside the mere supply of labouring hands.\r\nIt made Rome the centre of the Mediterranean world, the place where all\r\nimportant issues were decided, and where it was necessary to reside. The\r\nwealthy landowner was practically compelled to spend most of his time in\r\nthe ruling city, in close touch with public affairs. Now this compelled\r\nhim to manage his estates by stewards, keeping an eye on them so far\r\nas his engagements in Rome left him free to do so. And this situation\r\ncreated a demand for highly-qualified stewards. The supply of these had\r\nto come mainly from the eastern countries of old civilization. But if\r\ntechnical skill could thus be procured (and it was very necessary for the\r\nvariety of crops that were taking the place of corn), it was generally\r\naccompanied by an oriental subtlety the devices of which were not easy\r\nto penetrate. From the warnings of the agricultural writers, as to the\r\nneed of keeping a strict watch on a _vilicus_, we may fairly infer that\r\nthese favoured slaves were given to robbing their masters. The master,\r\neven if he had the knowledge requisite for practical control, seldom\r\nhad the leisure for frequent visits to his estate. What he wanted was\r\na regular income to spend: and the astute steward who was always ready\r\nwith the expected cash on the appointed day had little fear of reprimand\r\nor punishment. His own interest was that his own master should expect as\r\nlittle as possible, and it is obvious that this would not encourage a\r\nsincere effort to get the most out of the estate in a favourable year.\r\nHis master’s expectations would then rise, and the disappointment of poor\r\nreturns in a bad year might have serious consequences for himself.\r\n\r\nThese considerations may help us to understand why the history of the\r\nlater Roman Republic gives so gloomy a picture of agriculture.\r\n\r\nWe find the small farmer, citizen and soldier too, dying out as a class\r\nin a great part of Italy. We find the land passing into the hands of\r\na few large owners whose personal importance was vastly increased\r\nthereby. Whether bought cheap on a glutted market or ‘possessed’ in a\r\nsort of copyhold tenancy from the state, whether arable or pasture,\r\nit is at all events clear that the bulk of these _latifundia_ (if not\r\nthe whole) had been got on very easy terms. The new holders were not\r\nhampered by lack of capital or labour, as may often have been the case\r\nwith the old peasantry. Slave-labour was generally cheap, at times\r\nvery cheap. Knowledge and skill could be bought, as well as bone and\r\nmuscle. Like the ox and the ass, the slave was only fed and clothed\r\nand housed sufficiently to keep him fit for work: his upkeep while at\r\nwork was not the canker eating up profits. With the influx of wealth,\r\nthe spoils of conquest, the tribute of subject provinces, the profits\r\nof blackmail and usury, prices of almost everything were rising in the\r\nsecond century BC. Corn, imported and sold cheap to the Roman poor, was\r\nan exception: but the Italian landlords were ceasing to grow corn, save\r\nfor local consumption. Some authorities, if not all, thought[625] that\r\ngrazing paid better than tillage: and it was notorious that pasturage was\r\nincreasing and cultivation declining. The slave-herdsmen, hardy and armed\r\nagainst wolves and brigands, were a formidable class. When combined with\r\nmutinous gladiators they were, as Spartacus shewed in 73-1 BC, wellnigh\r\nirresistible save by regular armies in formal campaigns. The owner of a\r\nvast estate, controlling huge numbers of able-bodied ruffians who had\r\nnothing to lose themselves and no inducement to spare others, was in fact\r\na public danger if driven to desperation. He could mobilize an army of\r\nrobbers and cutthroats at a few days notice, live on the country, and\r\ndraw recruits from all the slave-gangs near. It was not want of power\r\nthat crippled the representatives of large-scale agriculture.\r\n\r\nAnd yet in the last days of the Republic, when the fabric of the state\r\nwas cracking under repeated strains, we are told that, among the various\r\ntypes of men led by financial embarrassments to favour revolutionary\r\nschemes, one well-marked group consisted of great landlords. These men,\r\nsays[626] Cicero, though deep in debt, could quite well pay what they owe\r\nby selling their lands. But they will not do this: they are ‘land-proud.’\r\nThe income from their estates will not cover the interest on their debts,\r\nbut they go on foolishly trying to make it do so. In this struggle they\r\nare bound to be beaten. In other words, the return on their landed\r\nestates is not enough to support a life of extravagance in Rome. So they\r\nborrow, at high interest. The creditors of course take good security,\r\nwith a margin for risks. So, in order to keep the social status of a\r\ngreat landlord, the borrower takes a loan of less than the capital value\r\nof his land, while he has to pay for the accommodation more than the\r\nincome from the land. Ruin is the certain end of such finance, and it is\r\nonly in a revolution that there is any hope of ‘something turning up’ in\r\nfavour of the debtor. We must not suppose that all or most of the great\r\nlandlords of the day had reached the stage of embarrassment described\r\nby Cicero. That there were some in that plight, is not to be doubted,\r\neven when we have allowed freely for an orator’s overstatements. But it\r\nis hardly rash to suppose that there were some landlords who were not\r\nin debt, at least to a serious extent, either through good returns from\r\ntheir lands or from other investments, or even from living thriftily.\r\nWhat seems quite clear is that large-scale farming of land was by no\r\nmeans so remunerative financially as other forms of investment; and that\r\nthough, as pointed out above, it was carried on with not a few points in\r\nits favour.\r\n\r\nIn the same descriptive passage[627] the orator refers to another class\r\nof landowners ripe for revolution. These were the veterans of Sulla,\r\nsettled by him as _coloni_ on lands of farmers dispossessed on pretext\r\nof complicity with his Marian opponents. Their estates were no doubt on\r\na smaller scale than those of the class just spoken of above. But they\r\nwere evidently comfortable allotments. The discharged soldiers made bad\r\nfarmers. They meant to enjoy the wealth suddenly bestowed, and they had\r\nno notion of economy. Their extravagance, one form of which was the\r\nkeeping of a number[628] of slaves, soon landed them hopelessly in debt.\r\nSo they also saw their only chance of recovery in a renewal of civil war\r\nand fresh confiscations. It was said that a number of necessitous rustics\r\n(probably some of the very men ejected from the farms) were ready to\r\njoin them in a campaign of plunder. Here we have a special picture of\r\nthe military colonist, one of the most sinister figures in the last age\r\nof the Republic. It is no doubt highly coloured, but the group settled\r\nin Etruria were probably some of the worst specimens. In such hands\r\nagriculture could not flourish, and the true interests of Rome could\r\nhardly have suffered a more deadly blow than the transfer of Italian\r\nlands from those who could farm them to those who could not. It was not\r\nmerely that lands were ‘let down.’ Italy was made less able to maintain\r\na native population, fitted and willing to serve the state in peace\r\nand war. The effects of this diminution of the free rustic population\r\nwere most seriously felt under the Empire. Writers of the Augustan age\r\ndeplore[629] the disappearance of the old races in a large part of\r\nItaly, displaced by alien slaves; and their cry is repeated by later\r\ngenerations. The imperial country that had conquered the Mediterranean\r\nworld became dependent on subjects and foreigners for her own defence.\r\n\r\nThe evil plight of agriculture in Cicero’s day was merely a continuation\r\nand development of the process observable in the second century.\r\nExperience had probably moderated some of the crude and blundering\r\nmethods of the land-grabbers whose doings provoked the agrarian movement\r\nof the Gracchi. But in essence the system was the same. And it was a\r\nfailure, a confessed evil. Why? It is easy to reply that slave-labour\r\nis wasteful; and this is I believe an economic truism. But it is well\r\nto look a little further. Let me begin by quoting from an excellent\r\nbook[630] written at a time when this subject was one of immediate\r\npractical interest. ‘The profitableness which has been attributed to\r\nslavery is profitableness estimated exclusively from the point of view\r\nof the proprietor of slaves.... The profits of capitalists may be\r\nincreased by the same process by which the gross revenue of a country is\r\ndiminished, and therefore the community as a whole may be impoverished\r\nthrough the very same means by which a portion of its number is enriched.\r\nThe economic success of slavery therefore is perfectly consistent with\r\nthe supposition that it is prejudicial to the material wellbeing of the\r\ncountry where it is established.’ These propositions I do not dispute:\r\nI had come to the same conclusion long before I read this passage. I\r\nfurther admit that in the case of Rome and Italy the community as a whole\r\nwas impoverished by the slave-system: it was the constant influx of\r\ntributes from the provinces that kept up the appearance of wealth at the\r\ncentre of empire. But whether, in the case of agriculture, the capitalist\r\nlandlords were really enriched by the profits of plantation slavery, is\r\nsurely a question open to doubt.\r\n\r\nThose of them whose capital sunk in great estates and gangs of slaves\r\nbrought in only a moderate return, while they were borrowing at a\r\nhigher rate of interest, were certainly not the richer for their landed\r\ninvestments. To keep up a fictitious show of solid wealth for the moment,\r\nthey were marching to ruin. But the man who made his income from landed\r\nestates suffice for his needs,—can we say that he was enriched thereby?\r\nHardly, if he was missing the chance of more remunerative investments\r\nby having his money locked up in land. He made a sacrifice, in order\r\nto gratify a social pride which had in Roman public life a certain\r\npolitical value. Under the Republic, this political value might be\r\nrealized in the form of provincial or military appointments, profitable\r\nthrough various species of blackmail. But the connexion of such profits\r\nwith ownership of great plantations is too remote to concern us here.\r\nA smart country-place, where influential friends could be luxuriously\r\nentertained, was politically more to the point. Now if, as seems\r\ncertain, the great plantations were not always (perhaps very seldom\r\nwere) a strictly economic success, though protected against Transalpine\r\ncompetition[631] in wine and oil, can we discern any defects in the\r\nsystem steadily operating to produce failure?\r\n\r\nWhen we admit that slave-labour is wasteful, we mean that its output as\r\ncompared with that of free labour is not proportionate to the time spent.\r\nHaving no hope of bettering his condition, the slave does only just\r\nenough to escape punishment; having no interest in the profits of the\r\nwork, he does it carelessly. If, as we know, the free worker paid by time\r\nneeds constant watching to keep him up to the mark, much more is this\r\ntrue of the slave. Hence a system of piece-work is disliked by the free\r\nman and hardly applicable in practice to the case of the slave. But we\r\nare not to forget that the slave, having been bought and paid for, draws\r\nno money wage. The interest on his prime cost is on the average probably\r\nmuch less than a free man’s wage; but the master cannot pay him off and\r\nbe rid of him when the job is done. The owned labourer is on his owner’s\r\nhands so long as that owner owns him. Against this we must set the very\r\nlow standard of feeding clothing housing etc allowed in the case of the\r\nslave. Nor must we ignore the economic advantage of slavery as ensuring a\r\npermanent supply of labour: for the free labourer was (and is) not always\r\nto be had when wanted. These were pretty certainly the considerations\r\nthat underlay the organization described by the Roman writers on _res\r\nrustica_; a regular staff of slaves for everyday work, supplemented by\r\nhired labour at times of pressure or for special jobs. And the growing\r\ndifficulty of getting hired help probably furnished the motive for\r\ndeveloping the system of _coloni_. By letting parcels of an estate to\r\nsmall tenants a landlord could secure the presence of resident freemen\r\nin his neighbourhood. These in their spare time could be employed as\r\nlabourers. At how early a date stipulation for labour in part payment of\r\ntheir rents placed such tenants on a ‘soccage’ footing is not certain.\r\nIt has rightly or not, been detected in Columella. At all events it\r\ncontained the germ of predial serfdom.\r\n\r\nNow, so long as slave-labour was the permanent and vital element in\r\nagriculture, success or failure depended entirely on the efficiency\r\nof direction and control. Accordingly the regular organization of a\r\ngreat estate was a complete hierarchy. At the head was the _vilicus_,\r\nhaving under him foremen skilled in special branches of farm work and\r\nhead-shepherds and the like. Even among the rank and file of the slaves\r\nmany had special duties occupying all or part of their time, for it was\r\nan object to fix responsibility. But it is clear that the efficiency of\r\nthe whole organization depended on that of the _vilicus_. And he was a\r\nslave, the chattel of a master who could inflict on him any punishment\r\nhe chose. The temptation to rob his master[632] for his own profit was\r\nprobably not nearly so strong as we might on first thoughts suppose. If\r\nhe had contrived to hoard the fruits of his pilferings in portable cash,\r\nwhat was he to do with it? He was not free to abscond with it. He would\r\nbe well known in the neighbourhood: if any slave could escape detection\r\nas a runaway, it would not be he. And detection meant the loss of all\r\nhis privileges as steward, with severe punishment to boot. His obvious\r\npolicy was to cling to his stewardship, to induce his master to let him\r\nkeep a few beasts of his own (as _peculium_)[633] on some corner of the\r\nestate, and to wait on events. It might be that he looked forward to\r\nmanumission after long service. But I cannot find any authority for such\r\na supposition, or any concrete instance of a manumitted _vilicus_. This\r\ninclines me to believe that in practice to such a man manumission was no\r\nboon. He was in most cases a native of some distant country, where he\r\nhad long been forgotten. The farm of his lord was the nearest thing he\r\nhad to a home. I am driven to suppose that as a rule he kept his post as\r\nlong as he could discharge its duties, and then sank into the position\r\nof a quasi-pensioned retainer who could pay for his keep by watching\r\nhis successor. Ordinary slaves when worn out may have been put to light\r\nduties about the farm, care of poultry etc, and he might direct them, so\r\nfar as the new steward allowed. I am guessing thus only in reference to\r\naverage cases. The brutal simplicity of selling off worn-out slaves for\r\nwhat they would fetch was apparently not unknown, and is approved[634] by\r\nCato.\r\n\r\nIt has been briefly hinted above that the steward’s obvious interest lay\r\nin preventing his master from expecting too much in the way of returns\r\nfrom the estate. The demand for net income, that is to say the treatment\r\nof agriculture as an investment yielding a steady return year in and year\r\nout, was economically unsound. A landlord in public life wanted a safe\r\nincome; interest on good debentures, as we should say. But to guarantee\r\nthis some capitalist was needed to take the risks of business, of course\r\nwith the prospect of gaining in good years more than he lost in bad ones.\r\nNow the Roman landlord had no such protection. In a business subject to\r\nunavoidable fluctuations he was not only entitled to the profits but\r\nliable to the losses. Imagine him just arrived from Rome, pledged already\r\nto some considerable outlay on shows or simple bribery, and looking for\r\na cash balance larger than that shewn at the last audit. Let the steward\r\nmeet him with a tale of disaster, and conceive his fury. Situations of\r\nthis kind must surely have occurred, perhaps not very seldom: and one of\r\nthe two men was in the absolute power of the other. We need not imagine\r\nthe immediate[635] sequel. Stewards on estates for miles round would be\r\nreminded of their own risks of disgrace and punishment, and would look\r\nto their own security. I suggest that the habitual practice of these\r\ntrusted men was to keep the produce of an estate down to a level at\r\nwhich it could easily be maintained; and, if possible, to represent it\r\nas being even less than it really was. Thus they removed a danger from\r\nthemselves. This policy implied an easygoing management of the staff, but\r\nthe staff were not likely to resent or betray it. A master like Cato was\r\nperhaps not to be taken in by a device of the kind: but Catos were rare,\r\nand the old man’s advice to look sharply after your _vilicus_ sounds as\r\nif he believed many masters to be habitually fooled by their plausible\r\nstewards. If such was indeed the case, here we have at once a manifest\r\ncause of the decline of agriculture. The restriction of production would\r\nbecome year by year easier to arrange and conceal, harder and harder to\r\ndetect. The employment of freemen[636] as stewards seems not to have been\r\ntried as a remedy; partly perhaps because they would have insisted on\r\ngood salaries, partly because they were free to go,—and, if rogues[637],\r\nnot empty-handed.\r\n\r\nThe cause to which I have pointed is one that could continue operating\r\nfrom generation to generation, and was likely so to continue until such\r\ntime as the free farmer should once more occupy the land. The loving care\r\nthat agriculture needs could only return with him. It was not lack of\r\ntechnical knowledge that did the mischief; Varro’s treatise is enough to\r\nprove that. It was the lack of personal devotion in the landlords and\r\nmotive in the stewards. Principles without practice failed, as they have\r\nfailed and will fail. Nor must we lay much stress on the disturbances of\r\nthe revolutionary period. Had these, damaging though they were, been the\r\neffective cause of decline, surely the long peace under the early Empire\r\nwould have led to a solid revival. But, though a court poet might sing\r\nof revival to please his master, more serious witnesses tell a different\r\ntale. In the middle of the first century AD we have Lucan Columella\r\nand the elder Pliny. If Lucan’s pictures of the countryside peopled\r\nwith slave-gangs, and of the decay of free population, are suspected as\r\nrhetorically overdrawn, at least they agree with the evidence of Livy\r\nin the time of Augustus, so far as the parts near Rome are concerned.\r\nColumella[638] gravely deplores the neglect of agriculture, in particular\r\nthe delegation of management to slaves. The landlord and his lady have\r\nlong abdicated their interest in what was once a noble pursuit: it is\r\nnow a degrading one, and their places are taken by the _vilicus_ and\r\n_vilica_. Yet all he can suggest is a more perfect organization of the\r\nslave-staff, and the letting of outlying farms to tenants. Pliny tells\r\nthe same woeful story. And while he vents his righteous indignation on\r\nthe _latifundia_ that have ruined Italy, he also mentions instances of\r\ngreat profits[639] made by cultivators of vines and olives on estates\r\nof quite moderate size. But these successful men were not of the social\r\naristocracy: they were freedmen or other humble folks who themselves\r\nlooked sharply after their own business.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when we are told[640], and rightly, that with establishment of\r\nthe Empire the political attraction of Rome was lessened, and that the\r\ninterest of wealthy landlords became more strictly economic in character,\r\nwe must not be in haste to identify this change with a return of genuine\r\nprosperity. That a sort of labour-crisis followed the restoration of\r\npeace is reasonably inferred from the fact that the kidnapping[641] of\r\nfreemen, and their incorporation in the slave-gangs of great estates,\r\nwas one of the abominations with which the early Principate had to\r\ndeal. In a more peaceful world the supply of new slaves fell off, and\r\nthe price doubtless rose. It would seem that at the same time free\r\nwage-earners were scarce, as was to be expected after the civil wars. So\r\nthe highwayman, probably often a discharged soldier, laid hands on the\r\nunprotected wayfarer. After taking his purse, he made a profit of his\r\nvictim’s person by selling him as a slave to some landowner in need of\r\nlabourers, who asked no questions. Once in the _ergastulum_ the man had\r\nsmall chance of regaining his freedom unless and until an inspection of\r\nthese private prisons was undertaken by the government. Such phenomena\r\nare not likely to be the inventions of sensational writers; for the\r\ngovernment, heavily weighted with other responsibilities, was driven to\r\nintervene and put down the scandal. But to do this was not to supply the\r\nnecessary labour. That problem remained, and in the attempt to solve it\r\nan important development in the organization of large estates seems to\r\nhave taken place. While the regular labour was as before furnished by the\r\nslave-staff, and greater care taken[642] to avoid losses by sickness,\r\nand while even the breeding of slaves under certain restrictions was\r\nfound worthy of attention, the need of extra hands at certain seasons\r\nwas met by an arrangement for retaining potential free labourers within\r\neasy reach. This was an extension of the system of tenant _coloni_.\r\nParcels of the estate were let to small farmers, whose residence was\r\nthereby assured. Columella[643] advises a landlord in dealing with his\r\ntenants to be more precise in exacting from them work (_opus_) than rent\r\n(_pensiones_), and Weber[644] takes _opus_ to mean not merely the proper\r\ncultivation of their several plots but a stipulated amount of labour on\r\nthe lord’s farm. The practice of exacting labour from debtors[645] in\r\ndischarge of their debt was not a new one, and this arrangement seems\r\nto be the same in a more systematic form. By taking care to keep the\r\nlittle farm sufficiently small, and fixing the rent sufficiently high,\r\nthe tenant was pretty certain to be often behind with his rent. In such\r\nconditions, even if the tenant did not encumber himself by further\r\nborrowing, it is clear that he was very liable to sink into a ‘soccage’\r\ntenant, bound to render regular services without wage. Nominally free, he\r\nwas practically tied to the soil; while the landlord, nominally but the\r\nowner of the soil, gradually acquired what was of more value than a money\r\nrent,—the ownership of his tenant’s services. In the growing scarcity of\r\nslave labour the lord had a strong motive for insisting on his rights,\r\nand so the free worker travelled down the road to serfdom.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the history of rustic slavery, and its bearing on the\r\nlabour-question, from the end of the second Punic war to the time of\r\nMarcus Aurelius, it is not necessary to refer to every indication of the\r\ndiscontents that were normal in the miserable slave-gangs. A few actual\r\noutbreaks of which we have definite records will serve to illustrate the\r\nsort of sleeping volcano, ever liable to explode, on which thousands of\r\nItalian landlords were sitting. The writers on agriculture were fully\r\nconscious of the peril, and among various precepts designed to promote\r\norder (and, so far as possible, contentment) none is more significant\r\nthan the advice[646] not to have too many slaves of the same race.\r\nDictated by the desire to make rebellious combinations difficult, this\r\nadvice is at least as old as Plato[647] and Aristotle.\r\n\r\nSo early as 196 BC we hear[648] of a slave-rising in Etruria, put down\r\nwith great severity by a military force. In 185 there was a great\r\nrising[649] of slave-herdsmen (_pastores_) in Apulia, put down by the\r\nofficer then commanding the SE district. In about another half-century\r\nwe begin the series of slave-wars which troubled the Roman world for\r\nsome 60 or 70 years and caused a vast destruction of lives and property.\r\nIt was the growth of the plantation system under a weak and distracted\r\ngovernment that made such horrors possible. In 139 we hear of a rising\r\nin Sicily, where the plantation system was in full swing. From 135 there\r\nwas fierce war[650] in the island, not put down till 131 after fearful\r\nbloodshed. The war of Aristonicus[651] in the new province of Asia, from\r\n132 to 130, seems to have been essentially a slave-war. In Sicily the\r\nold story[652] was repeated 103-99 with the same phenomena and results.\r\nAnd in the last age of the Republic, 73 to 71 BC, Italy was devastated\r\nby the bands of Spartacus, a joint force of gladiators[653] and rustic\r\nslaves. For many months the country was at their mercy, and their final\r\ndestruction was brought about more by their own disunion than by the\r\nsword of Roman legions. It is recorded[654] to the credit of Catiline\r\nthat he refused to enlist rustic slaves in the armed force with which\r\nhe fought and fell at Pistoria, resisting the less scrupulous advice of\r\nhis confederates in Rome. During the upheaval of the great civil wars\r\nthe slaves enjoyed unusual license. Many took arms: probably many others\r\nescaped from bondage. But the establishment of the Empire, though the\r\nsupply of slave labour was not equal to the demand, did not put an end to\r\nslave-risings. For instance, in 24 AD a former soldier of the Imperial\r\nGuard planned an insurrection[655] in the neighbourhood of Brundisium. By\r\npromising freedom to the bold slave-herdsmen scattered about the Apennine\r\nforests he got together what was evidently a force of considerable\r\nstrength. The lucky arrival of a squadron of patrol vessels enabled the\r\nlocal quaestor to break up the conspiracy before it could make head. But\r\nTiberius did not dally with so serious a matter: a detachment of troops\r\ncarried off the ringleader and his chief accomplices to Rome. Tacitus\r\nremarks that there was in the city a widespread uneasiness, owing to\r\nthe enormous growth of slave-gangs while the freeborn population was\r\ndeclining.\r\n\r\nThese specimens are enough to illustrate a public danger obvious _a\r\npriori_ and hardly needing illustration. The letter of Tiberius[656] to\r\nthe Senate in 22 AD shews how he had brooded over the social and economic\r\ncondition of Italy. He saw clearly that the appearance of prosperity in\r\na country where parks and mansions multiplied, and where tillage was\r\nstill giving way to pasturage, was unsound. He knew no doubt that these\r\nsigns pointed to the decline of the free rural population as still in\r\nprogress. As an experienced general he could hardly ignore the value\r\nof such a free population for recruiting armies to serve the state, or\r\nregard its decline with indifference. He refers to the burden of imperial\r\nresponsibilities. Now the system inherited from Augustus set Italy in a\r\nprivileged position as the imperial land. Surely Tiberius cannot have\r\noverlooked the corresponding liability of Italy to take a full share in\r\nthe defence of the empire. Yet in present circumstances her supply of\r\nvigorous manhood was visibly failing. If the present tendencies continued\r\nto act, the present system would inevitably break down. But, however much\r\nTiberius was inclined to do justice to the Provinces, he could not escape\r\nhis first duty to Italy without a complete change of system: and for this\r\nhe was not prepared. Such misgivings of course could not be expressed in\r\na letter to the Senate; but that an Emperor, temperamentally prone to\r\nworry, did not foresee the coming debility and degradation of Italy, and\r\nfret over the prospect, is to me quite incredible.\r\n\r\nThe movement for checking luxury, which drew this letter from Tiberius,\r\nresulted according to Tacitus in a temporary reduction of extravagance in\r\nentertainments. The influence of senators brought in from country towns\r\nor the Provinces helped in promoting a simpler life. It was example,\r\nnot legislation, that effected whatever improvement was made. It was\r\nthe example of Vespasian that did most to reform domestic economy. But\r\nthe historian was well aware that reforms depending on the lead of\r\nindividuals are transient. We have no reason to believe that any lasting\r\nimprovement of agriculture was produced by these fitful efforts. From\r\nstray references in Tacitus, from the letters of the younger Pliny, from\r\nnotices in Juvenal and Martial, it is evident that in the great plain\r\nof the Cisalpine and in the Italian hill country farming of one kind or\r\nanother went on and prospered. In such districts a real country life\r\nmight be found. But this was no new development: it had never ceased. Two\r\nconditions were necessary, remoteness from Rome and difficulty of access,\r\nwhich often coincided. Estates near the city (_suburbana_) were mostly,\r\nif not in all cases, held as resorts for rest or pleasure. If a steward\r\ncould grow a fair supply of farm-produce, so much the better: but the\r\nduty of having all ready for visits of the master and his friends was\r\nthe first charge on his time and attention. Even at some considerable\r\ndistance from the city the same condition prevailed, if an estate lay\r\nnear a main road and thus could be reached without inconvenient exertion.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII. CATO.\r\n\r\nThe book _de agri cultura_[657] of =M Porcius Cato= (234-149 BC) is a\r\nremarkable work by a remarkable man. It is generally agreed that it\r\nrepresents his views, though the form in which it has come down to us\r\nhas led to differences of opinion as to the degree in which the language\r\nhas been modified in transmission. We need only consider some of the\r\ncontemporary facts and movements with which Cato was brought into contact\r\nand which affected his mental attitude as a public man. He took part\r\nin the second Punic war, and died just as the third war was beginning:\r\nthus he missed seeing the destruction of the great city which it had\r\nin his later years been his passion to destroy. The success of the\r\nhighly organized Punic agriculture is said[658] to have been one of the\r\ncircumstances that alarmed his keen jealousy: but we can hardly doubt\r\nthat he like others got many a hint from the rustic system of Carthage.\r\nAnother of his antagonisms was a stubborn opposition to Greek influences.\r\nIn the first half of the second century BC, the time of his chief\r\nactivities, these influences were penetrating Roman society more and\r\nmore deeply as Roman supremacy spread further and further to the East.\r\nWe need not dwell on his denunciations of Greek corruption in general\r\nand warnings against the menace to Roman thrift and simplicity. A good\r\ninstance may be found in the injunction[659] to his son, to have nothing\r\nwhatever to do with Greek doctors, a pack of rascals who mean to poison\r\nall ‘barbarians,’ who charge fees to enhance the value of their services,\r\nand have the impudence to apply the term ‘barbarians’ to us. The leader\r\nof the good-old-Roman party was at least thorough in his hates. And his\r\nantipathies were not confined to foreigners and foreign ways, but found\r\nample scope at home in opposition to the newer school of politicians,\r\nwhose views were less narrow and hearty than his own.\r\n\r\nIn Cato’s time the formation of great landed estates, made easy by the\r\nruin of many peasant farmers in the second Punic war, was in full\r\nswing. The effective government of Rome was passing more and more into\r\nthe hands of the Senate, and the leading nobles did not neglect their\r\nopportunities of adding to their own wealth and power. Sharing the\r\nmilitary appointments, they enriched themselves with booty and blackmail\r\nabroad, particularly in the eastern wars: and, being by law excluded from\r\nopen participation in commerce, they invested a good part of their gains\r\nin Italian land. From what we learn as to the stale of Italy during the\r\nlast century of the Republic, it seems certain that this land-grabbing\r\nprocess took place chiefly if not wholly in the more accessible parts\r\nof the country, so far as arable lands were concerned. Etruria and the\r\ndistricts of central Italy near Rome were especially affected, and also\r\nLucania. Apulia soon became noted for its flocks and herds, which grazed\r\nthere in winter and were driven in the summer months to the mountain\r\npastures of Samnium. The pasturage of great private ‘runs’ (_saltus_) was\r\nthus supplemented by the use of wastes that were still state-property,\r\nand the tendency to monopolize these latter on favourable terms was no\r\ndoubt still growing. With the troubles that arose later out of this\r\nsystem of _possessiones_ we are not here concerned. But the increase\r\nof grazing as compared with tillage is an important point; for that\r\nit was the most paying sort of farming was one of the facts expressly\r\nrecognised[660] by Cato. The working of estates on a large scale was\r\npromoted by the plentiful supply of slaves in this period. On arable\r\nlands they were now employed in large gangs, sometimes working in chains,\r\nunder slave overseers whose own privileges depended on their getting the\r\nutmost labour out of the common hands. In pastoral districts they enjoyed\r\nmuch greater freedom. The time was to come when these _pastores_, hardy\r\nruffians, often armed against wild beasts, would be a public danger. But\r\nfor the present it is probable that one of their chief recommendations\r\nwas that they cost next to nothing for their keep.\r\n\r\nNo man knew better than Cato that it was not on such a land-system\r\nas this that Rome had thriven in the past and risen to her present\r\ngreatness. He was proud[661] of having worked hard with his own hands in\r\nyouth, and he kept up the practice of simple living on his own estate,\r\nsitting down to meals with the slaves[662] whom he ruled with the\r\nstrictness of a practical farmer. Around him was going on the extension\r\nof great ill-managed properties owned by men whom political business and\r\nintrigues kept nearly all the year in Rome, and who gave little personal\r\nattention to the farming of their estates. When the landlord rebuilt\r\nhis _villa_, and used his new country mansion mainly for entertaining\r\nfriends, the real charge of the farm more and more passed to the\r\nplausible slave who was always on the spot as steward. Cato knew very\r\nwell that these _vilici_ did not as a rule do the best for their lords.\r\nThey had no real interest in getting the most out of the land. The owner,\r\nwho wanted ready money for his ambitions and pleasures, was hardly the\r\nman to spend it on material improvements in hope of an eventual increase\r\nof income: thus a steward could easily find excuses for a low standard\r\nof production really due to his own slackness. All this demoralizing\r\nletting-down of agriculture was anathema to the champion of old-Roman\r\nideas and traditions. It was a grave factor in the luxury and effeminacy\r\nthat to his alarm were undermining the solid virtues of the Roman people.\r\nAbove all things, it had what to his intensely Roman nature was the\r\nmost fatal of defects—it did not pay. Roman nobles were in fact making\r\ntheir chief profits out of plundering abroad, and ceasing to exercise\r\nold-fashioned economy at home. With the former evil Cato waged open war\r\nas statesman and orator. How he dealt with the latter as a writer on\r\nagriculture I proceed to inquire.\r\n\r\nWe may classify the several points of view from which agriculture could\r\nbe regarded under a few heads, and see what position in relation to\r\neach of these was taken up by Cato. First, as to the scale of farming\r\noperations. He does not denounce great estates. He insists on the\r\nmaintenance of a due proportion[663] between the house and the land.\r\nNeither is to be too big for the other. A decent dwelling[664] will\r\ninduce the landlord to visit his estate more often; a fine mansion will\r\nbe costly and tempt him to extravagance. Secondly, it is on this frequent\r\npersonal attention that successful management depends. For your steward\r\nneeds the presence of the master’s eye to keep him to his duty. Thirdly,\r\nhe accepts the position that the regular staff of labourers are to be\r\nslaves, and some at least of these[665] are in chains (_compediti_). For\r\nspecial work, in time of harvest etc, extra labour is to be hired, and\r\nof this some is free labour, perhaps not all. For contractors employing\r\ngangs of labourers play a considerable part. Their remuneration may be\r\nin cash, or they may receive a share[666] of the produce (_partiario_).\r\nSome of their labourers are certainly free: if they do not pay the wages\r\nregularly, the _dominus_ is to pay them and recover from the contractor.\r\nBut it is not clear that contractors employed freemen exclusively, and\r\nthere is some indication[667] of the contrary. Fourthly, there is no\r\nsuggestion of a return to quite small peasant holdings, though he opens\r\nthe treatise with an edifying passage[668] on the social political and\r\nmilitary virtues of farmers, and cites the traditional description of\r\n_virum bonum_ as being _bonum agricolam bonumque colonum_. For his own\r\nscheme is not one for enabling a poor man to win a living for himself\r\nand family out of a little patch of ground. It is farming for profit;\r\nand, though not designed for a big _latifundium_, it is on a considerable\r\nscale. He contemplates[669] an oliveyard of 240 _iugera_ and a vineyard\r\nof 100 _iugera_, not to mention all the other departments, and the rigid\r\nprecepts for preventing waste and getting the most out of everything\r\nare the most striking feature of his book. The first business[670] of\r\nan owner, he says, is not to buy but to sell. Fifthly, it is important\r\nto notice that he does not suggest letting all or part of the estate to\r\ntenants. He starts by giving good advice as to the pains and caution[671]\r\nneeded in buying a landed property. But, once bought, he assumes that\r\nthe buyer will keep it in hand and farm it for his own account. It has\r\nbeen said on high authority[672] that the plan of letting farms to\r\ntenant _coloni_ was ‘as old as Italy.’ I do not venture to deny this.\r\nBut my inquiry leads me to the conviction that in early times such an\r\narrangement was extremely rare: the granting of a plot of land during\r\npleasure (_precario_) by a patron to a client was a very different\r\nthing. Cato only uses the word[673] _colonus_ in the general sense of\r\n_cultivator_, and so far as he is concerned we should never guess that\r\nfree tenant farmers were known in Italy. Sixthly, whereas in Varro\r\nand Columella we find the influence of later Greek thought shewn in a\r\ndesire to treat even rustic slaves as human and to appeal to the lure\r\nof reward rather than the fear of punishment, to Cato the human chattel\r\nseems on the level of the ox. When past work, both ox and slave are to\r\nbe sold[674] for what they will fetch. This he himself says, and his\r\ndoctrine was duly recorded by Plutarch as a mark of his hard character.\r\nIt is therefore not surprising that he makes no reference to slaves\r\nhaving any quasi-property (_peculium_) of their own, though the custom of\r\nallowing this privilege was surely well known to him, and was probably\r\nvery ancient. If the final fate of the slave was to be sold as rubbish\r\nin order to save his keep, there was not much point in letting him keep\r\na few fowls or grow a few vegetables in some waste corner of the farm.\r\nBut another characteristic story raises some doubt in this matter. We are\r\ntold that, having remarked that sexual passion was generally the cause of\r\nslaves getting into mischief, he allowed them[675] to have intercourse\r\nwith the female slaves at a fixed tariff. Now, to afford himself this\r\nindulgence, a slave must have had a _peculium_. But Cato did not think it\r\nworth mentioning,—unless of course we assume that a reference has dropped\r\nout of the text. Nor does he refer to manumission: but we hear of his\r\nhaving a freedman—probably not a farm-slave at all.\r\n\r\nCato’s position, taken as a whole, shews no sign of a reactionary aim,\r\nno uncompromising desire of reversion to a vanished past. Nor does he\r\nfall in with the latest fashion, and treat the huge _latifundium_ as\r\nthe last word in landowning. His precepts have in view a fairly large\r\nestate, and perhaps we may infer that he thought this about as much\r\nas a noble landlord, with other calls upon his energies, could farm\r\nthrough a steward without losing effective control. He does not, like the\r\nCarthaginian Mago, insist on the landlord residing[676] permanently on\r\nthe estate. In truth he writes as an opportunist. For this man, who won\r\nhis fame as the severest critic of his own times, knew very well that\r\ncontemporary Romans of good station and property would never consent\r\nto abdicate their part in public life and settle down to merely rustic\r\ninterests. Nor indeed would such retirement have been consistent with\r\nRoman traditions. But conditions had greatly changed since the days of\r\nthe farmer-nobles who could easily attend the Senate or Assembly at short\r\nnotice. The far greater extent of territory over which modern estates\r\nwere spread made it impossible to assume that they all lay near the city.\r\nAnd yet the attraction of Rome was greater than ever. It was the centre\r\nand head of a dominion already great, and in Cato’s day ever growing. The\r\ngreat critic might declaim against the methods and effects of this or\r\nthat particular conquest and denounce the iniquities of Roman officials:\r\nbut he himself bore no light hand in advancing the power of Rome, and\r\nthereby in making Rome the focus of the intrigues and ambitions of the\r\nMediterranean world. So he accepted the land-system of the new age, and\r\nwith it the great extension of slave-labour and slave-management, and\r\ntried to shew by what devotion and under what conditions it could be\r\nmade to pay. It must be borne in mind that slave-labour on the land was\r\nno new thing. It was there from time immemorial, ready for organization\r\non a large scale; and it was this extension of an existing institution\r\nthat was new. Agriculture had once been to the ordinary Roman citizen\r\nthe means of livelihood. It was now, in great part of the most strictly\r\nRoman districts of Italy, becoming industrialized as a field for\r\ninvestment of capital by the senatorial class, who practically controlled\r\nthe government and were debarred from openly engaging in commerce. The\r\nexploitation of rustic properties as income-producing securities was\r\nmerely a new phase of the grasping hard-fisted greed characteristic of\r\nthe average Roman. Polybius, observing Roman life in this very age with\r\nGreek eyes, was deeply impressed[677] by this almost universal quality.\r\nAnd Cato himself was a Roman of Romans. Plutarch[678] has preserved for\r\nus the tradition of his economic career. As a young man of small means\r\nhe led the hard life of a farmer, as he was not shy of boasting[679]\r\nin later years, and was a strict master of slaves. But he did not find\r\nfarming sufficiently remunerative, so he embarked on other enterprises.\r\nFarming remained rather as a pastime than a source of income: but he took\r\nto safe and steady investments, such as rights over lakes, hot springs,\r\nfullers’ premises, and land that could be turned to profit[680] through\r\nthe presence of natural pasture and woodland. From these properties he\r\ndrew large returns not dependent on the weather. By employing a freedman\r\nas his agent, he lent money on bottomry, eluding the legal restriction\r\non senators; and by combining with partners in the transaction he\r\ndistributed and so minimized the risks of a most profitable business. And\r\nall through life he dealt in slaves[681], buying them young, training\r\nthem, and selling at an enhanced price any that he did not want himself.\r\nHe bred some on his estate, probably not many. It is said that, in\r\naddition to her own children, his wife would suckle[682] slave-babies, as\r\na means of promoting good feeling in the household towards her son.\r\n\r\nIn these details, of the general truth of which there is no reasonable\r\ndoubt, we have a picture of a man of astounding versatility and force:\r\nfor of his political and military activities I have said nothing. But\r\nas a writer on agriculture how are we to regard him? Surely not as a\r\nthoroughgoing reformer. His experience had taught him that, if you must\r\nhave a good income (a point on which he and his contemporaries were\r\nagreed), you had better not look to get it from farming. But if for\r\nland-pride or other reasons you must needs farm, Cato is ready to give\r\nyou the best practical advice. That many (if indeed any) men of property\r\nwould take the infinite trouble and pains that his system requires from\r\na landlord, he was probably too wise to believe. But that was their\r\nbusiness. He spoke[683] as an oracle; as in public life ‘take it or leave\r\nit’ was the spirit of his utterances. The evidence of his life and of\r\nhis book, taken together, is more clear as shewing the unsatisfactory\r\nposition of rustic enterprise than from any other point of view.\r\n\r\nA few details relative to the staff employed on the estate are worthy\r\nof a brief notice. Cato is keenly alive to the importance of the\r\nlabour-question. In choosing an estate you must ascertain that there is a\r\nsufficient local supply[684] of labour. On the face of it this seems to\r\nmean free wage-earning labour, though the word _operarius_ is neutral.\r\nBut in a notable passage, in which he sets forth the advantage of being\r\non friendly terms with neighbours (neighbouring landlords), he says\r\n‘Don’t let your household (_familiam_) do damage: if you are in favour\r\nwith the neighbourhood, you will find it easier to sell your stock,\r\neasier[685] to get employment for your own staff at a wage, easier to\r\nhire hands: and if you are engaged in building they (the _vicini_) will\r\ngive you help in the way of human and animal labour and timber.’ Here we\r\nseem to come upon the hiring, not of free labourers, but of a neighbour’s\r\nslave hands on payment of a rent to their owner. The case would arise\r\nonly when some special rough job called for a temporary supply of more\r\nlabour. It would be the landlord’s interest to keep his neighbours\r\ninclined to oblige him. Thus by mutual accommodation in times of pressure\r\nit was possible to do with a less total of slaves than if each farm had\r\nhad to be provided with enough labour for emergencies. We may also remark\r\nthat it made the slaveowner less dependent on free wage-earners, who\r\nwould probably have raised their demands when they saw the landlord at\r\ntheir mercy. It must always be borne in mind that Cato is writing solely\r\nfrom the landlord’s point of view.\r\n\r\nThe leading fact relative to the staff is that the steward or head man\r\n(_vilicus_) under whom the various workers, slave or free, are employed\r\nis himself a slave. So too the _vilica_, usually his consort. Their\r\nposition is made quite clear by liability to punishment and by their\r\ndisqualification[686] from performance of all save the most ordinary\r\nand trivial religious ceremonies. Their duties are defined by jealous\r\nregulations. But in order to keep the steward up to the mark the master\r\nmust often visit the estate. It is significant that he is advised on\r\narrival to make a round of the place[687] without delay, and not to\r\nquestion his steward until he has thus formed his own impressions\r\nindependently. Then he can audit accounts, check stores, listen to\r\nexcuses, give orders, and reprimand failure or neglect. That the master\r\nneeded to be a man of knowledge and energy in order to make his estate a\r\nsource of profit when in charge of a steward, is evident. It may well\r\nbe that Cato insists so strongly on the need of these qualities because\r\nthey were becoming rare among the nobles of his day. But, though he\r\nknew that the efficiency of a slave steward could only be maintained by\r\nconstant and expert watching, he never suggests the employment of a free\r\nman in that capacity. The truth seems to be that the ‘Manager,’ a man\r\npaid by salary or percentage and kept up to the mark by fear of ‘losing\r\nhis place,’ is a comparatively modern figure. In antiquity the employment\r\nof Freedmen in positions of trust was a move in that direction, though\r\npatrons kept a considerable hold, beyond the purely economic one, on\r\ntheir freedmen. But for charge of a farm Cato does not suggest employment\r\nof a freedman.\r\n\r\nThe blending of free and slave labour might well have been brought\r\nout more clearly than it is: but to the author writing for his own\r\ncontemporaries it would seem needless to enlarge upon a condition which\r\neveryone took for granted. Yet there are passages where it is indicated\r\nplainly enough. Thus in the olive-press room a bed is provided[688]\r\nfor two free _custodes_ (apparently foremen) out of three: the third,\r\na slave, is put to sleep with the _factores_, who seem to be the hands\r\nemployed[689] to work the press, probably slaves, whose labour is merely\r\nbodily exertion. The _leguli_ who gather up the olives are probably free,\r\nfor they are interested[690] in making the amount so gathered as large as\r\npossible. Strippers, _strictores_, who pluck the olives from the tree,\r\nare also mentioned[691] in the chapter dealing with the harvesting of a\r\nhanging crop by a contractor. As the need of care to avoid damaging the\r\ntrees is insisted on, and all the workers are to take a solemn oath[692]\r\nthat they have stolen none of the crop, we may fairly infer that they\r\nare freemen. When the process of manufacture is let to a contractor,\r\nhis _factores_ are to take a similar oath, and are probably free. So\r\ntoo when a crop is sold hanging: if the buyer neglects to pay[693] his\r\n_leguli_ and _factores_ (which would cause delay) the landlord may pay\r\nthem himself and recover the amount from the buyer. On the other hand in\r\nthe grazing department the underlings are slaves. In case of the sale of\r\nwinter grazing, provision is made[694] for an arbitration for settlement\r\nof damages done by the _emptor aut pastores aut pecus emptoris_ to the\r\n_dominus_, or by the _dominus aut familia aut pecus_ to the _emptor_.\r\nAnd, until the compensation awarded is paid, the _pecus aut familia_ on\r\nthe ground is to be held in pledge by the party to whom compensation\r\nis due. This would generally be the landlord, and the _familia_ of the\r\n_emptor_ would be his _pastores_. Even so, when a speculator buys the\r\nseason’s lambs, he provides a _pastor_ for two months, and the man is\r\nheld in pledge[695] by the landlord until the account is finally settled.\r\n\r\nThere are casual references to other persons employed on the estate\r\nwhose condition has to be inferred from various indications with more\r\nor less certainty. Thus the _capulator_, who draws off the oil from\r\nthe press into vessels, is connected with the _custos_[696] and is not\r\nclearly distinct from him. He may be a slave, but the call for strict\r\ncleanliness and care at this stage of the operations rather suggests\r\nthe free wage-earner. An _epistates_ is mentioned[697] in a chapter\r\non food-rations (_familiae cibaria_), and grouped with the _vilicus_\r\nand _vilica_ and the _opilio_. They receive less food than the common\r\nhands engaged in rough manual labour. They are probably all slaves, the\r\n_epistates_ being a foreman of some sort, and the _opilio_ the head\r\nshepherd, the _magister pecoris_ of whom we often hear later. In the\r\nestimates[698] of the equipment required for a farm with oliveyard or\r\nvineyard the human staff is included with the other live and dead stock.\r\nThe _operarii_ mentioned in this connexion are evidently slave hands, and\r\nthe _bubulcus[699] subulcus asinarius opilio_ and _salictarius_ are the\r\nsame, only specialized in function. For an oliveyard of 240 _iugera_ the\r\nhuman staff is put at 13 (_summa homines xiii_), for a vineyard of 100\r\n_iugera_ it is 16, and the _operarii_ in particular are 10 as against\r\n5. The greater amount of digging[700] needed on a farm chiefly devoted\r\nto vines is the reason of the difference. These estimates are for the\r\npermanent staff, the _familia_, owned by the landlords in the same way as\r\nthe oxen asses mules sheep goats or pigs. So far as common daily labour\r\nis concerned, this staff should make the farm self-sufficing.\r\n\r\nBut there were many operations, connected with the life of the farm,\r\nfor performing which it was either not desirable or not possible to\r\nrely on the regular staff. It would never have paid to maintain men\r\nskilled in the work of special trades only needed on rare occasions.\r\nThus for erecting buildings the _faber_[701] is called in: the landlord\r\nfinds materials, the builder uses them and is paid for his work. Lime\r\nis needed for various purposes, and it may be worth while[702] to\r\nhave a kiln on the estate and do the burning there. But even so it is\r\nwell to employ a regular limeburner (_calcarius_) for the job. The\r\nlandlord finds limestone and fuel, and a way of payment is to work on\r\nshares (_partiario_) each party taking his share of the lime. The same\r\nshare-system (according to Keil’s text) is proposed for the operation\r\nknown as _politio_, which seems to include[703] weeding and ‘cleaning’\r\nof the land, at least for cereal crops, and also is prescribed for the\r\nskilled tending of a vineyard. For such works as these it is fairly\r\ncertain that the persons employed were assumed to be living in the\r\nneighbourhood. In the case of the blacksmith[704] (_faber ferrarius_)\r\nthere can be no doubt, for his forge is spoken of as a fit place for\r\ndrying grapes, hung presumably in the smoke of his wood fire. Now all\r\nthese skilled men are evidently free, and work on agreed terms. Some of\r\nthem are certainly not singlehanded, but whether their underlings are\r\nfreemen or slaves or both we are left to guess. In all cases their work\r\nis such as calls not only for skill and industry but also for good faith,\r\nwhich cannot be expected from slaves. It is in short contract-work,\r\nwhether the bargain be made in a formal agreement or not.\r\n\r\nThe employment of contractors, each with his own staff, at times\r\nof pressure such as the getting in and disposal of crops, has been\r\nreferred to above, and it has been remarked that some at least of this\r\nemergency-labour was performed by freemen. We must therefore conclude\r\nthat in Cato’s time there was a considerable supply of casual labourers\r\nin country districts, on whose services landlords could rely. The\r\ncontractor would seem to have been either a ‘ganger’ who bargained for\r\nterms with the landlord on behalf of his work-party, or a capitalist\r\nowning a gang of slaves. What made the difference would be the nature\r\nof the job in hand, according as skill or mere brute strength was\r\nchiefly required. But that slave labour was the essential factor, on\r\nwhich Catonian agriculture normally depended, is beyond all doubt. The\r\nslave steward is not only responsible[705] for the control of the slave\r\nstaff (_familia_) and their wellbeing and profitable employment. He is\r\nauthorized to employ other labour, even free labour, at need; only he\r\nmust not keep such persons hanging about the place. He is to pay them\r\noff and discharge them without delay, no doubt in order to prevent them\r\nfrom unsettling the slaves by their presence. And slaves must never\r\nbe idle. When a master calls his steward to account for insufficient\r\nresults on the farm, the latter is expected to plead in excuse not only\r\nthe weather but shortage of hands; slaves have been sick or have run\r\naway; or they have been employed[706] on state-work (_opus publicum\r\neffecisse_),—probably in mending the roads, for this is recognized below.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV. AGRICULTURE IN THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD.\r\n\r\nFrom the death of Cato in 149 BC to the date of Varro’s book _de re\r\nrustica_ (about 37 BC) is a space of more than a century. The one great\r\nfact of this momentous period in relation to agriculture is the public\r\nrecognition of the decay of the small farmers over a large part of\r\nItaly, and the vain attempt to revive a class well known to have been\r\nthe backbone of Roman strength. But the absorption of small holdings in\r\nlarge estates had already gone so far in the affected districts that\r\nthere was practically only one direction in which land-reformers could\r\nmove. To confiscate private property was forbidden by Roman respect for\r\nlegal rights: it appears in Roman history only after the failure of the\r\nGracchan movement, and as a phenomenon of civil war. There were however\r\ngreat areas of land of which the state was still in law proprietor,\r\nheld by individuals (often in very large blocks) under a system of\r\nrecognized occupation known as _possessio_. Tradition alleged that in\r\nRome’s early days this _ager publicus_ had been a cause of quarrels\r\nbetween the needy Commons who hungered for land and the rich nobles who\r\nstrove to monopolize the land annexed by war and now state-property. It\r\nwas known that one of the effects produced by the political equalization\r\nof the Orders in the fourth century BC had been legislation to restrain\r\nland-monopoly. But the Licinian laws of 367 BC had not made an end of the\r\nevil. Soon evaded, they had become in course of time wholly inoperative.\r\nThe new Patricio-Plebeian nobility quieted the claims of the poor by\r\ncolonial foundations and allotments of land in newly-conquered districts,\r\nwhile they continued to enrich themselves by ‘possession’ of the public\r\nland. Undisturbed possession gradually obscured the distinction between\r\nsuch holdings and the estates held in full ownership as _ager privatus_.\r\nBoundaries were confused: mixed estates changed hands by inheritance\r\nor sale without recognition of a legal difference in the tenure of\r\ndifferent portions: where improvements had been carried out, they applied\r\nindistinguishably to lands owned or possessed. The greater part of these\r\n_possessiones_ was probably not arable but pasture, grazed by numerous\r\nflocks and herds in charge of slave herdsmen. Now in Cato’s time the\r\nimports of foreign corn were already rendering the growth of cereal crops\r\nfor the market an unremunerative enterprise in the most accessible parts\r\nof Italy. Grazing paid better. It required fewer hands, but considerable\r\ncapital and wide areas of pasturage. It could be combined with the\r\nculture of the vine and olive; for the live-stock, brought down to the\r\nfarmstead in the winter months, supplied plentiful manure. Moreover, the\r\nwholesale employment of slaves enabled a landlord to rely on a regular\r\nsupply of labour. The slave was not liable to military service: so the\r\nmaster was not liable to have his staff called up at short notice. In\r\nshort, economic influences, aided by selfish or corrupt administration of\r\nthe laws under the rule of the nobility, gave every advantage to the rich\r\nlandlords. No wonder that patriotic reformers viewed the prospect with\r\nalarm, and sought some way of promoting a revival of the peasant farmers.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Gracchan movement and the causes of its failure are\r\nset forth from various points of view in histories[707] of Rome and\r\nspecial monographs. What concerns us here is to remark that its remedial\r\nlegislation dealt solely with land belonging to the state and occupied\r\nby individuals. Power was taken to ascertain its boundaries, to resume\r\npossession on behalf of the state, and to parcel it out in allotments\r\namong needy citizens. How far success in the aim of restoring a free\r\ncitizen population in the denuded districts was ever possible, we cannot\r\ntell. But we know that it did not in fact succeed. By 111 BC whatever had\r\nbeen achieved[708] was finally annulled. The bulk of the _ager publicus_\r\nhad disappeared. The sale of land-allotments, at first forbidden, had\r\nbeen permitted, and the process of buying out the newly created peasantry\r\nwent on freely. But large estates formed under the new conditions were\r\nsubject to no defect of title. They were strictly private property,\r\nthough the term _possessiones_ still remained in use. Slave-labour on\r\nsuch estates was normal as before. Indeed rustic slavery was now at its\r\nheight. This short period of attempted land-reform comes between the two\r\ngreat Sicilian slave-wars (135-2 and 103-99 BC), in the events of which\r\nthe horrors of contemporary agriculture were most vividly expressed. It\r\nwas also a time of great wars abroad, in Gaul, in Africa, and against the\r\nbarbarian invaders from the North. Roman armies suffered many defeats,\r\nand the prestige of Roman power was only restored by the military\r\nremodelling under Marius. When Marius finally threw over the principle\r\nthat military service was a duty required of propertied citizens, and\r\nraised legions from the poorest classes, volunteering with an eye to\r\nprofit, he in effect founded the Empire. We can hardly help asking[709]\r\nfrom what quarters he was able to draw these recruits. Some no doubt\r\nwere idlers already living in Rome attracted by the distributions of\r\ncheap corn provided by the Government in order to keep quiet the city\r\nmob. But these can hardly have been a majority of the recruits of this\r\nclass. Probably a number came in from rural districts, hearing that\r\nMarius was calling for volunteers and prepared to disregard altogether\r\nthe obsolete rules which had on occasion been evaded by others before\r\nhim. It is perhaps not too bold a conjecture to suggest that the casual\r\nwage-earners, the _mercennarii_ referred to by Cato, were an important\r\nelement in the New Model army of Marius. This landless class, living from\r\nhand to mouth, may have been declining in numbers, but they were by no\r\nmeans extinct. We meet them later in Varro and elsewhere. And no man knew\r\nbetter than Marius the military value of men hardened by field-labour,\r\nparticularly when led to volunteer by hopes of earning a higher reward in\r\na career of more perils and less monotony.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be supposed that agriculture throve under the conditions\r\nprevailing in these troubled years. The tendency must have been to\r\nreduce the number of free rustic wage-earners, while each war would\r\nbring captives to the slave-market. We can only guess at these economic\r\neffects. The following period of civil wars, from the Italian rising in\r\n90 BC to the death of Sulla in 78, led to a further and more serious\r\ndisturbance of the land-system. The dictator had to reward his soldiery,\r\nand that promptly. The debt was discharged by grants of land, private\r\nland, the owners of which were either ejected for the purpose or had been\r\nput to death. Of the results of this wholesale confiscation and allotment\r\nwe have abundant evidence, chiefly from Cicero. Making full allowance for\r\nexaggeration and partisan feeling, it remains sufficient to shew that\r\nSulla’s military colonists were economically a disastrous failure, while\r\nboth they and the men dispossessed to make room for them soon became a\r\ngrave political danger. The discharged soldiers desired an easy life as\r\nproprietors, and the excitements of warfare had unfitted them for the\r\npatient economy of farming. They bought slaves; but slaves cost money,\r\nand the profitable direction of slave-labour was an art calling for a\r\ndegree of watchfulness and skill that few landlords of any class were\r\nwilling or able to exert. So this substitution of new landowners for old\r\nwas an unmixed evil: the new men failed as farmers, and we hardly need to\r\nbe told that the feeling of insecurity produced by the confiscations was\r\na check on agricultural improvements for the time. Those of the ‘Sullan\r\nmen’ who sold their allotments (evading the law) would certainly not get\r\na good price, and the money would soon melt away.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the old Roman system, under which the ordinary\r\ncitizen was a peasant farmer who served the state as a soldier when\r\nneeded, was practically at an end. Compulsory levies were on certain\r\noccasions resorted to, for no abolition of the old liability to\r\nservice had taken place: but voluntary enlistment of young men, and\r\ntheir conversion into professional soldiers by technical training, was\r\nhenceforth the normal method of forming Roman armies. Armies were kept on\r\nfoot for long campaigns, and the problem of their peaceful disbandment\r\nwas one of the most serious difficulties of the revolutionary age. The\r\ntreasury had no large income to spend on money-pensions, so the demand\r\nfor allotments of land became a regular accompaniment of demobilization.\r\nMeanwhile the desperate condition of landlords in important districts,\r\nand the danger from the slave-gangs, were forcibly illustrated in the\r\nrising under Spartacus (73-1 BC) and the Catilinarian conspiracy. It\r\nis unfortunate that the scope of the land-bill of Rullus[710] in 63,\r\ndefeated by Cicero, is uncertain, and the effect of Caesar’s land-law of\r\n59 hardly less so. But one thing seems clear. In default of sufficient\r\nlands suitable for allotment, legislators were driven to propose the\r\nresumption of the rich Campanian domain. This public estate had long\r\nbeen let to tenants, real farmers, in small holdings; and the rents\r\ntherefrom were one of the safest sources of public income. To disturb\r\ngood tenants, and give the best land in Italy to untried men as owners,\r\nwas surely a bad business. It shews to what straits rulers were driven\r\nto find land for distribution. To enter into the details of the various\r\nland-allotments between the abortive proposal of Rullus and the final\r\nsettlement of Octavian would be out of place here. But it is well to note\r\nthat the plan of purchasing private land for pension-allotments, proposed\r\nin the bill of Rullus, was actually carried out by the new Emperor and\r\nproudly recorded[711] by him in his famous record of the achievements\r\nof his life. The violent transfer of landed properties from present\r\nholders to discharged soldiers of the triumviral armies had evidently\r\nbeen both an economic failure and a political evil. To pay for estates\r\ntaken for purpose of distribution was a notable step towards restoration\r\nof legality and public confidence. Whether it immediately brought about a\r\nrevival of agriculture on a sound footing is a question on which opinions\r\nmay justifiably differ. Much will depend on the view taken by this or\r\nthat inquirer of the evidence of Varro and the Augustan poets Horace and\r\nVergil.\r\n\r\n    NOTE—In Prendergast’s _Cromwellian Settlement of Ireland_\r\n    (ed 2, 1870), chapter IV a, much interesting matter may be\r\n    found. Cruel expulsions, corrupt influences, and the sale of\r\n    their lots by soldiers to officers, their frequent failure\r\n    as cultivators, etc, stand out clearly. The analogy to the\r\n    Roman cases must of course not be too closely pressed, as the\r\n    conditions were not identical.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV. VARRO.\r\n\r\n=M Terentius Varro= wrote his treatise _de re rustica_ in 37-6 BC at the\r\nage of 80. The subject was only one of an immense number to which he\r\ndevoted his talents and wide learning when not actively engaged in public\r\nduties. The last republican rally under Brutus and Cassius had failed at\r\nPhilippi in 42, and the Roman world was shared out between the Triumvirs.\r\nIn 36 the suppression of Lepidus declared what was already obvious,\r\nthat Antony and Octavian were the real holders of power and probable\r\nrivals. Proscriptions, confiscations, land-allotments to soldiers, the\r\nwars with Antony’s brother Lucius and the great Pompey’s son Sextus, had\r\nadded to the unsettlement and exhaustion of Italy. If it appeared to\r\nVarro that a treatise on farming would be opportune (and we may fairly\r\nconjecture that it did), there was surely much to justify his opinion in\r\nthe distressful state of many parts of the country. But at this point\r\nwe are met by a passage[712] in the work itself which seems to prove\r\nthat he took a very different view of present agricultural conditions\r\nin Italy. Some of the speakers (the book is in form a dialogue) declare\r\nthat no country is better cultivated than Italy, that no other country\r\nis so fully cultivated all through (_tota_), that Italian crops are in\r\ngeneral the best of their several kinds, and in particular that Italy\r\nis one great orchard. Instances in point are given. That Varro, like\r\nCicero, took great care[713] to avoid anachronisms and improbabilities,\r\nthat his characters are real persons, and that he tries hard to fit the\r\nseveral topics to the several characters, is not to be denied. But it\r\nis perhaps too much to assume that such general remarks as those just\r\ncited are meant to represent the known personal opinions of the speakers.\r\nIf we could be sure of the date at which the dialogue is supposed to\r\nbe held, we might have a more satisfactory standard for estimating the\r\nsignificance and historical value of these utterances. Unluckily we\r\nhave no convincing evidence as to the intended date. The scene of the\r\nsecond book can be laid in 67 BC with reasonable certainty, and that of\r\nthe third in 54 BC. But no passage occurs in the first book sufficient\r\nto furnish material for a like inference. When Stolo refers[714] to\r\nVarro’s presence with the fleet and army at Corcyra, some have thought\r\nthat he has in mind the time of the civil war in 49 BC. It is much more\r\nlikely that the reference is to Varro’s service[715] as one of Pompey’s\r\nlieutenants in the pirate war of 67 BC. The dialogue of Book I would then\r\nbe placed after the summer of that year, probably not much later. The\r\nboast of the speakers as to the splendid cultivation of Italy in general\r\nwould refer to the time when the disturbance caused by the confiscations\r\nand assignations of Sulla was dying down and the rising of Spartacus had\r\nlately been suppressed. It would be placed before the later disturbances\r\ncaused by measures designed to satisfy the claims of Pompeian Caesarian\r\nand Triumviral armies. Vergil had not yet been driven from his Cisalpine\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nWhether by placing Book I in this interval, and by supposing that\r\nthe circumstances of that time would fit the utterances of Varro’s\r\ncharacters, I am exceeding the limits of sober guesswork, I cannot judge.\r\nBut I am convinced that in any case upland pastures and forest-lands[716]\r\naccounted for a very large part of the surface of Italy then, as they do\r\nstill. Indeed Varro recognizes this in his references to the migration\r\nof flocks and herds according to the seasons, and particularly when he\r\nnotes not only the great stretches of rough land to be traversed but also\r\nthe need of active and sturdy _pastores_ able to beat off the assaults\r\nof wild beasts and robbers. Surely the complete cultivation of Italy,\r\ncompared as it is with that of other countries, is a description not\r\nto be taken literally, but as a natural exaggeration in the mouth of a\r\nself-complacent Roman agriculturist. Be this as it may, the treatise\r\nmarks a great advance on that of Cato in some respects. Many details\r\nare common to both writers, in particular the repeated insistence on\r\nthe main principle that whatever the farmer does must be made to pay.\r\nProfit, not sentiment or fancy, was their common and truly Roman aim. But\r\nin the century or more that had elapsed since Cato wrote other authors\r\n(such as Saserna) had treated of farming, and much had been learnt from\r\nGreek and Punic authorities. Knowledge of the products and practices of\r\nforeign lands had greatly increased, and Varro, who had himself added to\r\nthis store, made free use of the wider range of facts now at the service\r\nof inquirers. And the enlarged outlook called for a systematic method.\r\nAccordingly Varro’s work is clearly divided into three discussions, of\r\ntillage (Book I), grazing and stock-breeding (II), and keeping fancy\r\nanimals (III) chiefly to supply the market for table-luxuries. And he\r\ngoes into detail in a spirit different from that of Cato. Cato jerked out\r\ndogmatic precepts when he thought fit, for instance his wonderful list of\r\nfarm-requisites. Varro is more concerned with the principles, the reasons\r\nfor preferring this or that method, derived from the theories and\r\nexperience of the past. For instance, in estimating the staff required,\r\nhe insists[717] on its being proportioned to the scale of the work to be\r\ndone: as the average day’s work (_opera_) varies in efficiency according\r\nto the soil, it is not possible to assign a definite number of hands to\r\na farm of definite area. Nor is he content simply to take slave-labour,\r\nsupplemented by hired free labour and contract-work, for granted. In\r\na short but important passage he discusses the labour-question, with\r\nreasons for the preference of this or that class of labour for this\r\nor that purpose, of course preferring whichever is likely to give the\r\nmaximum of profit with the minimum of loss.\r\n\r\nIt is this passage[718] that is chiefly of interest from my present point\r\nof view, and I will therefore translate it in full.\r\n\r\n‘So much for the four conditions[719] of the farm that are connected\r\nwith the soil, and the second four external to the farm but bearing on\r\nits cultivation. Now for the appliances used in tillage. Some classify\r\nthese under two heads (_a_) men (_b_) the implements necessary for their\r\nwork. Others under three[720] heads (_a_) the possessed of true speech\r\n(_b_) the possessed of inarticulate speech (_c_) the speechless. In these\r\nclasses respectively are included[721] (_a_) slaves (_b_) oxen (_c_)\r\nwaggons, and such are the three kinds of equipment. The men employed\r\nin all tillage are either slaves or freemen or both. Free labour is\r\nseen in the case of those who till their[722] land themselves, as poor\r\npeasants[723] with the help of their families mostly do: or in that of\r\nwage-earners[724], as when a farmer hires free hands to carry out the\r\nmore important operations on his farm, vintage or hay-harvest and the\r\nlike: such also are those who were called “tied men”[725] in Italy, a\r\nclass still numerous in Asia Egypt and Illyricum. Speaking of these[726]\r\nas a class, I maintain that in the tillage of malarious land[727] it pays\r\nbetter to employ free wage-earners than slaves; even in a healthy spot\r\nthe more important operations, such as getting in vintage or harvest,\r\nare best so managed. As to their qualities, Cassius writes thus: in\r\nbuying[728] labourers you are to choose men fit for heavy work, not less\r\nthan 22 years of age and ready to learn farm-duties. This you can infer\r\nfrom giving them other tasks and seeing how they perform them, or by\r\nquestioning[729] new slaves as to the work they used to do under their\r\nformer owner. Slaves should be neither timid nor high-spirited. Their\r\noverseers[730] should be men able to read and write, in fact with a touch\r\nof education, honest fellows, somewhat older than the mere labourers\r\njust mentioned. For these are more willing to obey their elders. Above\r\nall things the one indispensable quality in overseers is practical\r\nknowledge of farming. For the overseer is not only to give orders, but\r\nto take part in carrying them out; so that the slave may do as he sees\r\nthe overseer do, and note the reasonableness of his own subordination to\r\none his superior in knowledge. On the other hand the overseer should not\r\nbe allowed to enforce obedience by the lash rather than by reprimand,—of\r\ncourse supposing that the same effect[731] is produced. Again, you should\r\nnot buy too many slaves of the same race, for nothing breeds trouble in\r\nthe household[732] more than this. For the overseers there should be\r\nrewards to make them keen in their work: care should be taken to allow\r\nthem a private store[733] and slave concubines to bear them children, a\r\ntie which steadies them and binds them more closely to the estate. It is\r\nthese family ties that distinguish the slave-gangs from Epirus and give\r\nthem a high market-value. You should grant favours to overseers to gain\r\ntheir goodwill, and also to the most efficient of the common hands; with\r\nthese it is also well to talk over the work that is to be undertaken,\r\nfor it makes them think that their owner takes some account of them and\r\ndoes not utterly despise them. They can be given more interest in their\r\nwork by more generous treatment in the way of food or clothing, or by\r\na holiday or by leave to keep a beast or so of their own at grass on\r\nthe estate, or other privileges: thus any who have been overtasked or\r\npunished may find some comfort[734] and recover their ready goodwill\r\ntowards their owner.’\r\n\r\nThis passage well illustrates the advance in scientific treatment of\r\nthe subject since the time of Cato. The analysis and classification may\r\nnot be very profound, but it tends to orderly method, not to oracles.\r\nThe influence of Greek writings is to be traced, for instance in the\r\nrules for the choice and treatment of slaves. The writings of Aristotle\r\nand his school had been studied in Rome since the great collection had\r\nbeen brought by Sulla from the East. How far Varro actually borrows from\r\nAristotle or Plato or Xenophon is not always easy to say. The advice to\r\navoid getting too many slaves of one race or too spirited, and to use\r\nsexual relations as a restraining tie, were by this time common-places\r\nof slave-management, and appear under Cato in somewhat cruder practical\r\nforms. But Varro is involved in the difficulties that have ever beset\r\nthose who try to work on double principles, to treat the slave as at\r\nonce the chattel of an owner and a partner in common humanity. So he\r\ntells his reader ‘manage your slaves as men, if you can get them to obey\r\nyou on those terms; if not,—well, you must make them obey—flog them.’\r\nHumanitarian principles have not gone far in the system of Varro, who\r\nlooks solely from the master’s point of view. The master gets rather\r\nmore out of his slaves when they work to gain privileges than when they\r\nwork merely to escape immediate punishment. So he is willing to offer\r\nprivileges, and the prospect of promotion to the higher ranks of the\r\nstaff. Overseers and the best of the common hands may form a little\r\nquasi-property of their own by the master’s leave. But these _peculia_\r\ndo not seem to be a step on the road to manumission, of which we hear\r\nnothing in this treatise. We are left to infer that rustic slaves on\r\nestates generally remained there when past active work, tolerated\r\nhangers-on, living on what they could pick up, and that to have acquired\r\nsome _peculium_ was a comfortable resource in old age. In short, the\r\nhopes of the worn-out rustic bondman were limited indeed.\r\n\r\nWhen we note Varro’s attitude towards free labour we cannot wonder that\r\nhumanitarianism is not conspicuous in his treatment of slavery. Hired\r\nmen are more to be trusted than slaves, so you will employ them, as Cato\r\nadvised, for jobs that need care and honesty and that cannot wait. But he\r\nadds a sinister hint as to employing them on work dangerous to health.\r\nYour own slaves for whom you have paid good money are too valuable to be\r\nexposed to such risks. The great merit of the _mercennarius_ is that,\r\nwhen the job is done and his wage paid, you have done with him and have\r\nno further responsibility. This brutally industrial view is closely\r\nconnected with the legal atmosphere of Roman civilization, in which\r\nVarro lived and moved. The debtor discharging his debt by serving his\r\ncreditor as a farm-hand, once an ordinary figure in Italy, was now only\r\nfound abroad: Varro mentions this unhappy class, for he is not thinking\r\nof Italy alone. It is interesting to hear from him that peasant-farmers\r\nwere not extinct in Italy. But we are not told whether they were still\r\nnumerous or whether they were mostly to be found in certain districts, as\r\nfrom other authorities we are tempted to infer. Nor do we learn whether\r\nmen with small farms of their own often went out as wage-earners; nor\r\nagain whether landless _mercennarii_ were in his time a numerous class.\r\nThese omissions make it very difficult for us to form any clear and\r\ntrustworthy picture of rural conditions as they presented themselves to\r\nVarro. It would seem that they were in general much the same as in Cato’s\r\ntime, but that Varro is more inclined to discuss openly some details\r\nthat Cato took for granted. So in his turn Varro takes some things for\r\ngranted, passing lightly over details that we cannot but wish to know.\r\n\r\nThere is however one important matter, ignored by Cato (at least in\r\nhis text as we have it), to which reference is found in Varro. It is\r\nthe presence of the free tenant farmer (_colonus_) in the agricultural\r\nsystem of Italy. He tells us that the formal lease[735] of a farm\r\nusually contained a clause by which the _colonus_ was forbidden to graze\r\na she-goat’s offspring on the farm. In another passage[736] the same\r\nprohibition is mentioned, but with this limitation, that it applies only\r\nto land planted with immature saplings. So poisonous were the teeth of\r\nnibbling goats thought to be. The restriction imposed on the tenant\r\nsuggests that the landlord was bargaining at an advantage; the lessor\r\ncould dictate his terms to the lessee. That the tenant farmers of this\r\nperiod were at least in some cases humble dependants of their landlords\r\nis clearly shewn by a passage[737] of Caesar. In order to hold Massalia\r\nfor Pompey in 49 BC, Domitius raised a squadron of seven ships, the crews\r\nfor which he made up from his own[738] slaves freedmen and tenants. Soon\r\nafter he refers to this force[739] as the tenants and herdsmen brought\r\nby Domitius. These herdsmen are no doubt some of the slaves before\r\nmentioned. It is evident that the free retainers called tenants are not\r\nconceived as having much choice in the matter when their noble lord\r\ncalled them out for service. Probably their effective freedom consisted\r\nin the right to own property (if they could get it), to make wills, to\r\nrear children of their own, and other like privileges. But their landlord\r\nwould have so great a hold[740] on them that, though in theory freemen,\r\nthey were in practice compelled to do his bidding. In later times we\r\nshall find the tenant farmer a common figure in rural life, but very\r\ndependent on his landlord; and it is by no means clear that his position\r\nhad ever been a strong and independent one. Of Varro all we can say is\r\nthat he does refer to farm-tenancy as a business-relation, and infer from\r\nhis words that in that relation the landowner had the upper hand.\r\n\r\nBeside what we may call the legal sense of ‘tenant,’ Varro also uses\r\n_colonus_ in its older sense of ‘cultivator.’ In discussing the\r\nconvenience of being able to supply farm needs, and dispose of farm\r\nsurplus, in the neighbourhood, he points out that the presence or absence\r\nof this advantage may make all the difference whether a farm can be\r\nmade to pay or not. For instance, it is seldom worth while to keep\r\nskilled craftsmen[741] of your own: the death of one such specialist\r\nsweeps away the (year’s) profit of the farm. Only rich landowners can\r\nprovide for such services in their regular staff. So the usual practice\r\nof _coloni_ is to rely on local men for such services, paying a yearly\r\nfee and having a right to their attendance at call. The _coloni_ here\r\nare simply ‘farmers,’ and there is nothing to shew that they do not own\r\ntheir farms. The connexion with the verb _colere_ appears even more\r\nstrongly where _pastor_ is contrasted[742] with _colonus_, grazier with\r\ntiller: and in that passage the _colonus_ is apparently identical with\r\nthe _dominus fundi_ just below. The _coloni_ of these passages can hardly\r\nbe mere tenants, but on the other hand they are certainly not great\r\nlandowners. They seem to be men farming their own land, but in a small\r\nway[743] of business. Whether there were many such people in Varro’s\r\nItaly, he does not tell us. Nor do we find any indication to shew whether\r\nthey would normally take part in farm work with their own hands. When\r\nhe deplores[744] the modern tendency to crowd into the city, where men\r\nuse their hands for applauding shows, having abandoned the sickle and\r\nthe plough, he is merely repeating the common lament of reformers. There\r\nis no sign of any hope of serious reaction against this tendency: the\r\nimportation and cheap distribution of foreign corn is a degenerate and\r\nruinous policy, but there it is. Varro admired the small holdings and\r\npeasant farmers of yore, but no man knew better that independent rustic\r\ncitizens of that type had passed away from the chief arable districts of\r\nItaly never to return.\r\n\r\nThat small undertakings were still carried on in the neighbourhood of\r\nRome and other urban centres, is evident from the market-gardens of the\r\nImperial age. A notable case[745] is that of the bee-farm of a single\r\n_iugerum_ worked at a good profit by two brothers about 30 miles north of\r\nRome. Varro expressly notes that they were able to bide their time so as\r\nnot to sell on a bad market. He had first-hand knowledge of these men,\r\nwho had served under him in Spain. Clearly they were citizens. They can\r\nhardly have kept slaves. It seems to have been a very exceptional case,\r\nand to be cited as such: it is very different from that of the peasant\r\nfarmer of early Rome, concerned first of all to grow food for himself and\r\nhis family. Agriculture as treated by Varro is based on slave labour, and\r\nno small part of his work deals with the quarters, feeding, clothing,\r\ndiscipline, sanitation, and mating, of the slave staff. True to his\r\nlegal bent, he is careful to safeguard the rights of the slaveowner by\r\nexplaining[746] the formal details necessary to effect a valid purchase,\r\nwith guarantee of bodily soundness, freedom from vice, and flawless\r\ntitle. Again, to keep slaves profitably it was urgently necessary to keep\r\nthem constantly employed, so that the capital sunk in them should not lie\r\nidle and the hands lose the habit of industry. Therefore, while relying\r\non local craftsmen for special skilled services occasionally needed,\r\nhe insists that a number of rustic articles should be manufactured on\r\nthe farm. ‘One ought not to buy anything that can be produced on the\r\nestate[747] and made up by the staff (_domesticis_ = _familia_), such as\r\nwicker work and things made of rough wood.’ Moreover, the organization\r\nof the staff in departments is an elaborate slave-hierarchy. Under the\r\ngeneral direction of the _vilicus_, each separate function of tillage or\r\ngrazing, or keeping and fattening fancy-stock has its proper foreman.\r\nSuch posts carried little privileges, and were of course tenable during\r\ngood behaviour. Some foremen would have several common hands under\r\nthem: none would wish to be degraded back to the ranks. It seems that\r\nsome wealthy men kept[748] birdcatchers huntsmen or fishermen of their\r\nown, but Varro, writing for the average landlord, seems to regard these\r\nas being properly free professionals. As for the common hands, the\r\n‘labourers’ (_operarii_), on whose bone and sinew the whole economic\r\nstructure rested, their condition was much the same as in Cato’s time,\r\nbut apparently somewhat less wretched. Varro does not propose to sell\r\noff worn-out slaves; this let us credit to humaner feelings. He shews a\r\nmarked regard for the health and comfort of slaves; this may be partly\r\nhumanity, but that it is also due to an enlightened perception of the\r\nowner’s interest is certain. He does not provide for an _ergastulum_,\r\nthough those horrible prisons were well known in his day. Why is this?\r\nPerhaps partly because slave-labour was no longer normally employed on\r\nestates in the extremely crude and brutal fashion that was customary in\r\nthe second century BC. And partly perhaps owing to the great disturbances\r\nof land-tenure since the measures of the Gracchi and the confiscations of\r\nSulla. The earlier _latifundia_ had been in their glory when the wealthy\r\nnobles sat securely in power, and this security was for the present at\r\nan end. But, if the slave _operarii_ were somewhat better treated, their\r\nactual field labour was probably no less hard. Many pieces of land could\r\nnot be worked with the clumsy and superficial plough then in use. Either\r\nthe slope of the ground forbade it, or a deeper turning of the soil was\r\nneeded, as for growing[749] vines. This meant wholesale digging, and\r\nthe slave was in effect a navvy without pay or respite. No wonder that\r\n_fossor_ became a proverbial term for mere animal strength and dull\r\nunadaptability. An interesting estimate of the capability of an average\r\ndigger is quoted[750] from Saserna. One man can dig over 8 _iugera_ in 45\r\ndays. But 4 day’s work is enough for one _iugerum_ (about ⅝ of an acre).\r\nThe 13 spare days allowed are set to the account[751] of sickness, bad\r\nweather, awkwardness, and slackness. Truly a liberal margin to allow for\r\nwaste. It cannot have been easy to farm at a profit with slave-labour\r\non such terms; for the slave’s necessary upkeep was, however meagre, a\r\ncontinual charge.\r\n\r\nAnd yet we do not find Varro suggesting that free wage-earning labour\r\nmight in the long run prove more economical than slave-labour even for\r\nrough work. Nay more, he does not refer to the employment of contractors\r\nwith their several gangs, each interested in getting his particular\r\njob done quickly and the price paid. He only refers to _mercennarii_\r\nin general terms, as we saw above. Nor does he speak[752] of _politio_\r\nas a special process, as Cato does. It may be that he did not think it\r\nworth while to enter into these topics. But it is more probable that the\r\nresults of agrarian legislation and civil warfare in the revolutionary\r\nperiod had affected the problems of rustic labour. The attempt to revive\r\nby law the class of small cultivating owners had been a failure. Military\r\nservice as a career had competed with rustic wage-earning. Men waiting\r\nto be hired as farm hands were probably scarce. Otherwise, how can we\r\naccount for the great armies raised in those days? To refer once more to\r\na point mentioned above, Varro does not suggest that the charge of an\r\nestate might with advantage be entrusted to a freeman as _vilicus_. That\r\nwe can discover all the reasons for the preference of slaves as stewards\r\nis too much to hope for. That it seemed to be a guarantee of honesty and\r\ndevotion to duty, the manager being wholly in his master’s power, is a\r\nfairly certain guess. And yet Varro like others saw the advisability of\r\nemploying free labour for occasional work of importance. Perhaps the\r\npermanent nature of a steward’s responsibilities had something to do with\r\nthe preference. It may well have been difficult to keep a hold on a free\r\nmanager. In management of a slave staff no small tact and intelligence\r\nwere needed as well as a thorough knowledge of farming. General\r\nexperience needed to be supplemented by an intimate knowledge[753] of\r\nthe conditions of the neighbourhood and the capacities of the particular\r\nestate. And a free citizen, whose abilities and energy might qualify\r\nhim for management of a big landed estate, had endless opportunities\r\nof turning his qualities to his own profit elsewhere. Whether as\r\nindividuals or in companies, enterprising Romans found lucrative openings\r\nin the farming of revenues, in state-contracts, in commerce, or in\r\nmoney-lending, both in Italy and in the Provinces. Such employments,\r\ncompared with a possible estate-stewardship, would offer greater personal\r\nindependence and a prospect of larger gains. And freemen of a baser and\r\nless effective type would have been worse than useless: certainly far\r\ninferior to well-chosen slaves.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI. CICERO.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly possible to avoid devoting a special section to the evidence\r\nof =Cicero=, though it must consist mainly of noting a number of isolated\r\nreferences to particular points. With all his many country-houses, his\r\ninterest in agriculture was slight. But his active part in public life\r\nof all kinds makes him a necessary witness in any inquiry into the facts\r\nand feelings of his time; though there are few witnesses whose evidence\r\nneeds to be received with more caution, particularly in matters that\r\noffer opportunity for partisanship. For our present purpose this defect\r\ndoes not matter very much. It is chiefly as confirming the statements of\r\nothers that his utterances will be cited.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect that Cicero was himself a man of generous instincts, and\r\nthat he was well read in the later Greek philosophies, we are tempted\r\nto expect from him a cosmopolitan attitude on all questions affecting\r\nindividuals. He might well look at human rights from the point of view\r\nof common humanity, differentiated solely by personal virtues and vices\r\nand unaffected by the accident of freedom or servitude. But we do not\r\nfind him doing this. He might, and did, feel attracted by the lofty\r\nnobility of the Stoic system; but he could not become a Stoic. No doubt\r\nthat system could be more or less adapted to the conditions of Roman\r\nlife: it was not necessary to make the Stoic principles ridiculous by\r\ncarrying[754] priggishness to the verge of caricature. But the notion\r\nthat no fundamental difference existed between races and classes, that\r\nfor instance the Wise Man, human nature’s masterpiece, might be found\r\namong slaves, was more than Cicero or indeed any level-headed Roman\r\ncould digest. The imperial pride of a great people, conscious of present\r\npredominance through past merit, could not sincerely accept such views.\r\nTo a Roman the corollary of accepting them would be the endeavour (more\r\nor less successful) to act upon them. This he had no intention of doing,\r\nand a mere theoretical assent[755] to them as philosophical speculations\r\nwas a detail of no serious importance. Taking this as a rough sketch of\r\nthe position occupied by Romans of social and political standing, we must\r\nadd to it something more to cover the case of Cicero. He was a ‘new man.’\r\nHe was not a great soldier. He was not a revolutionary demagogue. He was\r\nambitious. In order to rise and take his place among the Roman nobles he\r\nhad to fall in with the sentiments prevailing among them: the newly-risen\r\nman could not afford to leave the smallest doubt as to his devotion to\r\nthe privileges of his race and class. Thus, if there was a man in Rome\r\npeculiarly tied to principles of human inequality, it was Cicero.\r\n\r\nTherefore we need not be surprised to find that this quick-witted and\r\nwarm-hearted man looked upon those engaged in handwork with a genial\r\ncontempt[756] sometimes touched with pity. To him, as to the society in\r\nwhich he moved, bodily labour seemed to deaden interest[757] in higher\r\nthings, in fact to produce a moral and mental degradation. In the case\r\nof slaves, whose compulsory toil secured to their owners the wealth and\r\nleisure needed (and by some employed) for politics or self-cultivation,\r\nthe sacrifice of one human being for the benefit of another was an\r\nappliance of civilization accepted and approved from time immemorial.\r\nBut the position of the freeman working for wages, particularly of the\r\nman who lived by letting out his bodily strength[758] to an employer\r\nfor money, was hardly less degrading in the eyes of Roman society, and\r\ntherefore in those of Cicero. We have no description of the Roman mob\r\nby one of themselves. That the rough element[759] was considerable, and\r\nready to bear a hand in political disorder, is certain. But they were\r\nwhat circumstances had made them, and it is probable that the riotous\r\nparty gangs of Cicero’s time were not usually recruited among the best\r\nof the wage-earners. It is clear that many slaves took part in riots,\r\nand no doubt a number of freedmen also. In many rural districts disputes\r\nbetween neighbours easily developed into acts of force and the slaves of\r\nrival claimants did battle for their several owners. Moreover, slaves\r\nmight belong, not to an individual, but to a company[760] exploiting some\r\nstate concession of mineral or other rights. In such cases ‘regrettable\r\nincidents’ were always possible. And the wild herdsmen (_pastores_)\r\nroaming armed in the lonely hill-country were a ready-made soldiery ever\r\ninclined to brigandage or servile rebellions, a notorious danger. It was\r\nan age of violence in city and country. Rich politicians at last took to\r\nkeeping private bands[761] of swordsmen (_gladiatores_). And it is to be\r\nborne in mind that, while a citizen might be unwilling to risk the life\r\nof a costly[762] slave, his own property, a slave would feel no economic\r\nrestraint to deter him from killing his master’s citizen enemy.\r\n\r\nThe employment of slaves in the affrays that took place in country\r\ndistricts over questions of disputed right is fully illustrated in the\r\nspeeches[763] delivered in cases of private law. The fact was openly\r\nrecognized in the legal remedies provided, for instance in the various\r\n_interdicta_ framed to facilitate the trial and settlement of disputes\r\nas to _possessio_. The forms contemplated the probability of slaves\r\nbeing engaged in assailing or defending possession on behalf of their\r\nmasters, and the wording even varied according as the force in question\r\nhad been used by men armed or unarmed. Counsel of course made much or\r\nlittle of the happenings in each case according to the interest of their\r\nclients. But that bloodshed occurred at times in these fights is certain.\r\nAnd there was no regular police force to keep order in remote corners\r\nof the land. When slaves were once armed and set to fight, they would\r\nsoon get out of hand, and a slaveowner might easily lose valuable men.\r\nNay more, an epidemic of local brigandage might result, particularly in\r\na time of civil war and general unrest, and none could tell where the\r\nmischief would end. We can only form some slight notion of the effect of\r\nsuch conditions as these on the prospects of peaceful agriculture. The\r\nspeech _pro Quinctio_ belongs to 81 BC, the _pro Tullio_ to 71, the _pro\r\nCaecina_ to 69. When we reflect that the slave rising under Spartacus\r\nlasted from 73 to 71, and swept over a large part of Italy, we may fairly\r\nconclude that this period was a bad one for farming.\r\n\r\nThe most striking picture of the violence sometimes used in the disputes\r\nof rustic life meets us in the mutilated speech _pro Tullio_, of which\r\nenough remains to make clear all that concerns us. First, the form of\r\naction employed in the case was one of recent[764] origin, devised\r\nto check the outrages committed by bands of armed slaves, which had\r\nincreased since the disturbances of the first civil war. The need for\r\nsuch a legal remedy must have been peculiarly obvious at the time of the\r\ntrial, for the rising of Spartacus had only just been suppressed. Cicero\r\nrefers to the notorious scandal of murders committed by these armed\r\nbands, a danger to individuals and even to the state, that had led to the\r\ncreation of the new form of action at law. In stating the facts of the\r\ncase, of course from his client’s point of view, he gives us details[765]\r\nwhich, true or not, were at least such as would not seem incredible to a\r\nRoman court. Tullius owned an estate in southern Italy. That his title\r\nto it was good is taken for granted. But in it was reckoned a certain\r\nparcel of land which had been in undisputed possession of his father.\r\nThis strip, which was so situated as to form a convenient adjunct to a\r\nneighbouring estate, was the cause of trouble. The neighbouring estate\r\nhad been bought by two partners, who had paid a fancy price for it.\r\nThe bargain was a bad one, for the land proved to be derelict and the\r\nfarmsteads all burnt down. One of the partners induced the other to buy\r\nhim out. In stating the area of the property he included the border strip\r\nof land claimed by Tullius as his own. In the process of settlement of\r\nboundaries for the transfer to the new sole owner he would have included\r\nthe disputed ground, but Tullius instructed[766] his attorney and his\r\nsteward to prevent this: they evidently did so, and thus the ownership\r\nof the border strip was left to be determined by process of law. The\r\nsequel was characteristic of the times. The thwarted claimant armed a\r\nband of slaves and took possession[767] of the land by force, killing the\r\nslaves who were in occupation on behalf of Tullius, and committing other\r\nmurders and acts of brigandage by the way. We need not follow the case\r\ninto the law-court. What concerns us is the evidence of unfortunate land\r\nspeculation, of land-grabbing, of boundary-disputes, and of the prompt\r\nuse of violence to supersede or hamper the legal determination of rights.\r\nThe colouring and exaggeration of counsel is to be allowed for; but we\r\ncan hardly reject the main outlines of the picture of armed slave-bands\r\nand bloodshed as a rural phenomenon of the sorely tried South of Italy.\r\n\r\nThe speech _pro Caecina_ shews us the same state of things existing in\r\nEtruria. The armed violence alleged in this case is milder in form: at\r\nleast the one party fled, and nobody was killed. Proceedings were taken\r\nunder a possessory interdict issued by a praetor, and Cicero’s artful\r\npleading is largely occupied with discussion of the bearing and effect of\r\nthe particular formula employed. Several interesting transactions[768]\r\nare referred to. A man invests his wife’s dowry in a farm, land being\r\ncheap, owing to bad times, probably the result of the Sullan civil war.\r\nSome time after, he bought some adjoining land for himself. After his\r\ndeath and that of his direct heir, the estate had to be liquidated for\r\npurpose of division among legatees. His widow, advised to buy in the\r\nparcel of land adjoining her own farm, employed as agent a man who had\r\ningratiated himself with her. Under this commission the land was bought.\r\nCicero declares that it was bought for the widow, who paid the price,\r\ntook possession, let it to a tenant, and held it till her death. She\r\nleft her second husband Caecina heir to nearly all her property, and\r\nit was between him and the agent Aebutius that troubles now arose. For\r\nAebutius declared that the land had been bought by him for himself, and\r\nthat the lady had only enjoyed the profits of it for life in usufruct\r\nunder her first husband’s will. This was legally quite possible. At the\r\nsame time he suggested that Caecina had lost the legal capacity of taking\r\nthe succession at all. For Sulla had degraded the citizens belonging\r\nto Volaterrae, of whom Caecina was one. Cicero is more successful in\r\ndealing with this side-issue than in establishing his client’s claim\r\nto the land. The dispute arising out of that claim, the armed violence\r\nused by Aebutius to defeat Caecina’s attempt to assert possession, and\r\nthe interdict granted to Caecina, were the stages by which the case came\r\ninto court. Its merits are not certain. But the greedy characters on both\r\nsides, the trickery employed by one side or other (perhaps both), and the\r\nartful handling of the depositions of witnesses, may incline the reader\r\nto believe that the great orator had but a poor case. At all events\r\nfarming in Etruria appears as bound up with slave labour and as liable to\r\nbe disturbed by the violence of slaves in arms.\r\n\r\nIn the above cases it suited Cicero’s purpose to lay stress on the\r\nperils that beset defenceless persons who were interested in farms in\r\nout-of-the-way[769] places. Yet the use of armed force was probably\r\nmost habitual on the waste uplands, and his references to the lawless\r\ndoings of the brigand slave-bands fully confirm the warnings of Varro.\r\nHis tone varies according to the requirements of his client’s case, but\r\nhe has to admit[770] that wayfarers were murdered and bloody affrays\r\nbetween rival bands ever liable to occur. He can on occasion[771] boldly\r\ncharge a political opponent with deliberate reliance on such forces\r\nfor revolutionary ends. Thus of C Antonius he asserts ‘he has sold all\r\nhis live stock and as good as parted with his open pastures, but he is\r\nkeeping his herdsmen; and he boasts that he can mobilize these and start\r\na slave-rebellion whenever he chooses.’ There was no point in saying\r\nthis if it had been absurdly incredible. Another glimpse of the utter\r\nlawlessness prevalent in the wilds appears in the story[772] of murders\r\ncommitted in Bruttium. Suspicion rested on the slaves employed by the\r\ncompany who were exploiting the pitch-works in the great forest of Sila\r\nunder lease from the state. Even some of the free agents of the company\r\nwere suspected. The case, which was dealt with by a special criminal\r\ntribunal, belongs to the year 138 BC, and attests the long standing of\r\nsuch disorders. And it is suggestive of guilty complicity on the part of\r\nthe lessees that, though they eventually secured an acquittal, it was\r\nonly after extraordinary exertions on the part of their counsel.\r\n\r\nIndeed these great gangs of slaves in the service of _publicani_ were\r\nin many parts of Italy and the Provinces a serious nuisance. Wherever\r\nthe exploitation of state properties or the collection of dues was\r\nfarmed out to contractors, a number of underlings would be needed. The\r\nlower grades were slaves: a few rose to higher posts as freedmen of the\r\nvarious companies. Now some of the enterprises, such as mines quarries\r\nwoodlands and the collection of grazing dues on the public pastures,\r\nwere generally in direct contact with rural life, and employed large\r\nstaffs of slaves. The managers of a company were concerned to produce a\r\nhigh dividend for their shareholders: so long as this resulted from the\r\nlabours of their men, it was a matter of indifference to them whether\r\nneighbouring farmers were robbed or otherwise annoyed. That we hear\r\nlittle or nothing of such annoyances is probably owing to the practice\r\nof locking up slave-labourers at night in an _ergastulum_, for fear of\r\ntheir running away, not to keep them from doing damage. Runaways do not\r\nappear singly as a rustic pest. But in bands there was no limit to the\r\nharm that _fugitivi_ might do; witness the horrors of the slave-wars. In\r\nshort, wherever slaves were employed in large numbers, the possibility\r\nof violence was never remote. Their masters had always at hand a force\r\nof men, selected for bodily strength and hardened by labour, men with\r\nnothing but hopeless lives to lose, and nothing loth to exchange dreary\r\ntoil for the dangers of a fight in which something to their advantage\r\nmight turn up. No doubt the instances of slaves called to arms in rustic\r\ndisputes were far more numerous than those referred to by Cicero: he only\r\nspeaks of those with which he was at the moment concerned.\r\n\r\nIs it then true that in the revolutionary period farming depended on\r\nslave-labour while its security was ever menaced by dangers that arose\r\ndirectly out of the slave-system? I fear it is true, absurd though the\r\nsituation may seem to us. Between the great crises of disturbance were\r\nspells of comparative quiet, in which men could and did farm profitably\r\nin the chief agricultural districts of Italy. But it must be remembered\r\nthat many an estate changed hands in consequence of civil war, and that\r\nmany new landlords profited economically by appropriating the capital\r\nsunk in farms by their predecessors. The case of Sextus Roscius of Ameria\r\ngives us some light on this point. The picture drawn[773] by Cicero of\r\nthe large landed estate of the elder Roscius, of his wealth and interest\r\nin agriculture, of his jealous and malignant relatives, of the reasons\r\nwhy he kept his son Sextus tied to a rustic life, is undoubtedly full\r\nof colouring and subtle perversions of fact. Let it go for what it may\r\nbe worth. The accused was acquitted of the crime laid to his charge\r\n(parricide), but there is no sign that he was ever able to recover the\r\nestate and the home from which his persecutors had driven him. They had\r\nshared the plunder with Chrysogonus the favoured freedman of Sulla, who\r\nhimself bought the bulk of the property at a mere fraction of its market\r\nvalue, and it is practically certain that the rogues kept what they got.\r\nIt was easy to make agriculture pay on such terms. But what of the former\r\nowners of such properties, on whose ruin the new men’s prosperity was\r\nbuilt? Can we believe that genuine agricultural enterprise was encouraged\r\nby a state of things in which the fruits of long patience and skill were\r\nliable to sudden confiscation?\r\n\r\nIn Cicero, as in other writers, we find evidence of a wage-earning\r\nclass living by bodily labour alongside of the slave-population. But in\r\npassages where he speaks[774] of _mercennarii_ it is often uncertain\r\nwhether freemen serving for hire, or slaves hired from another owner,\r\nare meant. In his language the associations[775] of the word are mean.\r\nIt is true that you may buy for money not only the day’s-work (_operae_)\r\nof unskilled labourers but the skill (_artes_) of craftsmen. In the\r\nlatter case even Roman self-complacency will admit a certain dignity;\r\nfor men of a certain social status[776] such professions are all very\r\nwell. But the mere ‘hand’ is the normal instance; and for the time of his\r\nemployment he is not easily distinguished from a slave. Therefore Cicero\r\napproves[777] a Stoic precept, that justice bids you to treat slaves as\r\nyou would hirelings—don’t stint their allowances (food etc), but get your\r\nday’s-work out of them. In passages[778] where the word _mercennarius_ is\r\nnot used, but implied, there is the same tone of contempt, and it is not\r\nalways clear whether the workers are free or slaves. In short the word is\r\nnot as neutral as _operarius_, which connotes mere manual labour, whether\r\nthe labourer be free or not, and is figuratively used[779] to connote a\r\nmerely mechanical proficiency in any art. Our ‘journeyman’ is sometimes\r\nsimilarly used.\r\n\r\nThere are other terms in connexion with land-management the use of\r\nwhich by Cicero is worth noting. Thus a landlord may have some order to\r\ngive in reference to the cultivation of a farm. If he gives it to his\r\n_procurator_[780], it is as an instruction, a commission authorizing him\r\nto act; if to his _vilicus_, it is simply a command. For the former is a\r\nfree attorney, able at need to represent his principal even in a court\r\nof law: the latter is a slave steward, the property of his master. The\r\n_procurator_ is hardly a ‘manager’: he seldom occurs in connexion with\r\nagriculture, and seems then to be only required when the principal is a\r\nvery ‘big man,’ owning land on a large scale, and probably in scattered\r\nblocks. In such cases it would be convenient for (say) a senator to\r\ngive a sort of ‘power of attorney’ to an agent and let him supervise\r\nthe direction of a number of farms, each managed by a steward. I take\r\nthis policy to be just that against which the writers on agriculture\r\nwarn their readers. It sins against the golden rule, that nothing is a\r\nsubstitute for the Master’s eye. Whether the agent referred to in the\r\nspeech _pro Tullio_, who as well as the steward received[781] written\r\ninstructions from Tullius, was guilty of any neglect or blunder, we\r\ncannot tell. That any act done to a _procurator_ or by him was legally\r\nequivalent to the same done to or by his principal, is a point pressed in\r\nthe _pro Caecina_, no doubt because it was safe ground and an excuse for\r\nnot dwelling on weak points in a doubtful case.\r\n\r\nThe _colonus_ as a tenant[782] farmer, whom we find mentioned in Varro\r\nbut not in Cato, appears in Cicero. In the _pro Caecina_ we read[783]\r\nthat the widow lady took possession of the farm and let it (_locavit_);\r\nalso that the tenant was after her death still occupying the farm, and\r\nthat a visit of Caecina, in which he audited the accounts of the tenant,\r\nis a proof that Caecina himself was now in possession. That is, by\r\nasserting control of the sitting tenant Caecina made the man his agent so\r\nfar as to retain possession through the presence of his representative.\r\nIf the facts were as Cicero states them, the contention would be legally\r\nsound. For, as he points out in another passage, any representative[784]\r\nwill serve for these purposes of keeping or losing possession. If the\r\ninterdict-formula only says ‘attorney’ (_procurator_), this does not\r\nmean that only an attorney in the technical sense, a plenipotentiary\r\nagent appointed by an absentee principal with full legal formalities, is\r\ncontemplated. No, the brief formula covers agency of any kind: it will\r\napply to your tenant your neighbour your client or your freedman, in\r\nshort to any person acting on your behalf. In the great indictment of\r\nVerres[785] we find a good instance of tenancy in Sicily, where it seems\r\nto have been customary for large blocks of land to be held on lease from\r\nthe state by tenants-in-chief (_aratores_) who sometimes sublet parcels\r\nto _coloni_. In this case the trouble arose out of the tithe to which the\r\nland was liable. Verres, in order to squeeze an iniquitous amount out\r\nof a certain farm, appointed a corrupt court charged to inquire whether\r\nthe (arable) acreage had been correctly returned by the _colonus_. Of\r\ncourse they were instructed to find that the area had been fraudulently\r\nunderstated. But the person against whom judgment was to be given was not\r\nthe _colonus_, but Xeno, who was not the owner of the farm. He pleaded\r\nthat it belonged to his wife, who managed her own affairs; also that he\r\nhad not been responsible for the cultivation (_non arasse_). Nevertheless\r\nhe was not only compelled to pay a large sum of money to meet the\r\nunfair damages exacted, but subjected to further extortion under threat\r\nof corporal punishment. The returns on which the tithes were assessed\r\nwould seem to have been required from the actual cultivators, and the\r\nlessees of the year’s tithe to have had a right of action against the\r\nowners or chief-tenants of the land, if the tenant farmer defaulted in\r\nany particular. So far we are able to gather that tenant farmers were\r\nno exception at this time, though perhaps not a numerous class; and\r\nthat they were not persons of much social importance. That they were to\r\na considerable extent dependent on their landlords is probable, though\r\nnot actually attested by Cicero, for we have seen evidence of it in a\r\npassage of Caesar. Cicero’s reference[786] to the case of a lady who\r\ncommitted adultery with a _colonus_ is couched in such terms as to imply\r\nthe man’s social inferiority. In another passage[787] we hear of a man in\r\nthe Order of _equites equo publico_ being disgraced by a censor taking\r\naway his state-horse, and of his friends crying out in protest that he\r\nwas _optimus colonus_, thrifty and unassuming. Here we have a person of\r\nhigher social quality, no doubt: but I conceive _colonus_ to be used in\r\nthe original sense of ‘cultivator.’ To say ‘he is a good farmer’ does\r\nnot imply that he is a mere tenant, any more than it does in the notable\r\npassage of Cato.\r\n\r\nThe _vilicus_ generally appears in Cicero as the slave steward familiar\r\nto us from other writers. In one place[788] he is contrasted with\r\nthe _dispensator_, who seems to be a sort of slave clerk charged\r\nwith registering stores and serving out rations clothing etc. As this\r\nfunctionary seldom meets us in the rustic system of the period, we may\r\nperhaps infer that only large estates, where the _vilicus_ had no time\r\nto spare from purely agricultural duties, required such extra service.\r\nIn saying that he can read and write (_litteras scit_) Cicero may seem\r\nto imply that this is not to be expected from the _vilicus_: but the\r\ninference is not certain, for the agricultural writers require stewards\r\nto read at least. In another passage[789] we read that in choosing a\r\nslave for the post of steward the one thing to be kept in view is not\r\ntechnical skill but the moral qualities, honesty industry alertness.\r\nHere it is plain that the orator is warping the truth in order to suit\r\nhis argument: Varro would never have disregarded technical skill. For\r\nCicero’s point is that what the state needs most in its ‘stewards’ (that\r\nis, magistrates) is good moral qualities. On the same lines he had some\r\n16 years before compared[790] Verres to a bad steward, who has ruined\r\nhis master’s farm by dishonest and wasteful management, and is in a fair\r\nway to be severely punished for his offence. The tone of this passage is\r\nexactly that of old Cato, put in the rhetorical manner of an advocate.\r\n\r\nA few words must be said on the subject of manumission. In his defence\r\nof Rabirius, accused of high treason, Cicero launches[791] out into a\r\nburst of indignation at the attempted revival of an obsolete barbarous\r\nprocedure designed for his client’s destruction. The cruel method of\r\nexecution to which it points, long disused, is repugnant to Roman\r\nsentiment, utterly inconsistent with the rights of free humanity. Such a\r\nprospect[792] would be quite unendurable even to slaves, unless they had\r\nbefore them the hope of freedom. For, as he adds below, when we manumit\r\na slave, he is at once freed thereby from fear of any such penalties as\r\nthese. Taken by itself, this passage is better evidence of the liability\r\nof slaves to cruel punishment than of the frequent use of manumission.\r\nBut we know from Cicero’s letters and from other sources that freedmen\r\nwere numerous. And from a sentence[793] in one of the _Philippics_ we\r\nmay gather that it was not unusual for masters to grant freedom to\r\nslaves after six years of honest and painstaking service. I suspect that\r\nthis utterance, in the context in which it occurs, should not be taken\r\ntoo literally. That Romans of wealth and position liked to surround\r\nthemselves with retainers, humble and loyal, bound to their patron by\r\nties of gratitude and interest, is certain: and early manumissions were\r\nnaturally promoted by this motive. But the most pleasing instances\r\nwere of course those in which a community of pursuits developed a real\r\nsympathy, even affection between owner and owned, as in the case of\r\nTiro, on whose manumission[794] Quintus Cicero wrote to congratulate his\r\nbrother. In all these passages, however, there is one thing to be noted.\r\nThey do not look to the conditions of rustic life; and, so far as the\r\nevidence of Cicero goes, they do not shake my conviction that manumission\r\nwas a very rare event on country estates.\r\n\r\nA topic of special interest is the evidence of the existence of farmers\r\nwho, whether employing slaves or not, worked on the land in person. What\r\ndoes Cicero say as to αὐτουργία, in his time? It has been pointed out\r\nabove that, when it suits his present purpose, he not only enlarges on\r\nthe homely virtues of country folk but refers to the old Roman tradition\r\nof farmer-citizens called from the plough to guide and save the state in\r\nhours of danger. He made full use of this topic in his defence of Sextus\r\nRoscius, and represented his client as a simple rustic, reeking of the\r\nfarmyard,—how far truly, is doubtful. But he does not go so far as to\r\ndepict him ploughing or digging or carting manure. It is reasonable to\r\nsuppose that the slaves to whom he refers[795] did the rough farm-work\r\nunder his orders. When he can make capital out of the wrongs of the\r\nhumble labouring farmer, the orator does not shrink from doing so. One\r\nof the iniquities laid to the charge[796] of Verres is that he shifted\r\nthe burden of taking legal proceedings from the lessees of the Sicilian\r\ntithes (_decumani_) to the tithe-liable lessees of the land (the\r\n_aratores_). Instead of the tithe-farmer having to prove that his demand\r\nwas just, the land-farmer had to prove that it was unjust. Now this was\r\ntoo much even for those farming on a large scale: it meant in practice\r\nthat they had to leave their farms and go off to make their appeals at\r\nSyracuse. But the hardship was far greater in the case of small farmers\r\n(probably sub-tenants), of whom he speaks thus: ‘And what of those whose\r\nmeans of tillage[797] consist of one yoke of oxen, who labour on their\r\nfarms with their own hands—in the days before your governorship such\r\nmen were a very numerous class in Sicily—when they have satisfied the\r\ndemands of Apronius, what are they to do next? Are they to leave their\r\ntillages, leave their house and home, and come to Syracuse, in the hope\r\nof reasserting their rights at law against an Apronius[798] under the\r\nimpartial government of a Verres?’ No doubt the most is made of these\r\npoor men and their wrongs. But we need not doubt that there were still\r\nsome small working farmers in Sicily. In the half-century or so before\r\nthe time of Verres we hear[799] of free Sicilians who were sorely\r\ndisturbed by the great servile rebellions and even driven to make common\r\ncause with the insurgent slaves. Some such ‘small men’ were evidently\r\nstill to be found wedged in among the big plantations.\r\n\r\nAnother important passage occurs in the artful speech against the\r\nagrarian bill of Rullus. It refers to the _ager Campanus_, on the value\r\nof which as a public asset[800] Cicero insists. This exceptionally\r\nfertile district was, and had long been, let by the state to cultivating\r\ntenants, whose regularly-paid rents were one of the safest items in\r\nthe Roman budget. These farms were no _latifundia_, but apparently of\r\nmoderate size, such that thrifty farmers could make a good living in\r\nthis favoured land. With the various political[801] changes, carrying\r\nwith them disturbances of occupancy, caused by wars in the past, we\r\nare not here concerned. Cicero declares that one aim of the bill was\r\nthe assignation of this district to new freeholders, which meant that\r\nthe state treasury would lose a sure source of revenue. This, in the\r\ninterest of the aristocratic party, he was opposing, and undoubtedly\r\nmisrepresented facts whenever it suited his purpose. In matters of this\r\nkind, he says, the cry is often raised[802] that it is not right for\r\nlands to lie depopulated with no freemen left to till them. This no doubt\r\nrefers to the Gracchan programme for revival of the peasant farmers.\r\nCicero declares that such a cry is irrelevant to the present issue,\r\nfor the effect of the bill will be to turn out the excellent sitting\r\ntenants[803] only to make room for new men, the dependants and tools of a\r\npolitical clique. The reason why, after the fall of Capua in the second\r\nPunic war, that city was deprived of all corporate existence, and yet\r\nthe houses were left standing, was this: the menace of a disloyal Capua\r\nhad to be removed, but a town-centre of some sort could not be dispensed\r\nwith. For marketing, for storage[804] of produce, the farmers must have\r\nsome place of common resort: and when weary with working on their farms\r\nthey would find the town homesteads a welcome accommodation. Allowing for\r\nrhetorical colouring in the interests of his case, perhaps we may take it\r\nfrom Cicero that a fair number of practical working farmers were settled\r\non the Campanian plain. His prediction[805] that, if this district were\r\nto be distributed in freehold allotments, it would presently pass into\r\nthe hands of a few wealthy proprietors (as the Sullan allotments had been\r\ndoing) suggests a certain degree of sincerity. But taken as a whole the\r\nutterances of Cicero are too general, and too obviously meant to serve\r\na temporary purpose, to furnish trustworthy data for estimating the\r\nnumerical strength and importance of the working farmers in the Italy of\r\nhis day.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII. SALLUST AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nIn the writings of Cicero’s contemporaries other than Varro there is very\r\nlittle to be found bearing upon rustic life and labour as it went on in\r\ntheir time. Literature was occupied with other themes appropriate to the\r\npolitical conflicts or social scandals or philosophic questionings that\r\nchiefly interested various individuals and the circles in which they\r\nmoved. The origins of civilization formed a fascinating problem for some,\r\nfor instance the Epicurean =Lucretius=: but his theory of the development\r\nof agriculture deals with matters outside of our subject. The one helpful\r\npassage of =Caesar=[806] has been noticed already. So too has the\r\ncontemptuous reference[807] of =Sallust= to agriculture as slaves’ work.\r\nThis writer in a few places touches on points of interest. For instance,\r\nin speaking[808] of the various classes of men who were ripe for\r\nrevolution, he says ‘moreover there were the able-bodied men who had been\r\nused to earn a hard living as hired labourers on farms; the attraction of\r\nprivate and public bounties had drawn them into Rome, where they found\r\nidle leisure preferable to thankless toil.’ Such statements, unsupported\r\nby statistics, must be received with caution, but this assertion is so\r\nfar backed up by what we learn from other sources, that we can accept it\r\nas evidence. How many such rustic immigrants of this class there were\r\nat any given moment, is what we want to know, and do not. Again, in a\r\npassage[809] describing the popularity of Marius in 108 BC, he says ‘in\r\nshort, the commons were fired with such enthusiasm that the handworkers\r\nand the rustics of all sorts, men whose means and credit consisted in\r\nthe labour of their hands, struck work and attended Marius in crowds,\r\nputting his election before their own daily needs.’ In this there is\r\nperhaps some exaggeration, but the picture is probably true in the main.\r\nThe _agrestes_ may include both small farmers and labourers. But they\r\ncan hardly have come from great distances, and so were probably not very\r\nnumerous. The description is as loose as passages of the kind were in\r\nancient writers, and are still. The references to rustic slave-gangs, and\r\nCatiline’s refusal to arm them in support of his rising, have been cited\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nWe now pass into the period in which the last acts of the Roman\r\nRepublican drama were played and the great senatorial aristocrats, in\r\nwhose hands was a great share of the best lands in Italy, lost the\r\npower to exploit the subject world. Not only by official extortion in\r\nprovincial governorships, but by money-lending at usurious interest[810]\r\nto client princes or provincial cities, these greedy nobles amassed\r\ngreat sums of money, some of which was employed in political corruption\r\nto secure control of government at home. Civil wars and proscriptions\r\nnow thinned their ranks, and confiscations threw many estates into the\r\nmarket. The fall of Antony in 31 BC left Octavian master of the whole\r\nempire of Rome, an emperor ruling under republican disguises. Now it\r\nwas naturally and properly his aim to neutralize the effects of past\r\ndisorders and remove their causes. He looked back to the traditions of\r\nRoman growth and glory, and hoped by using the lessons thus learnt to\r\nrevive Roman prosperity and find a sound basis for imperial strength.\r\nHe worked on many lines: that which concerns us here is his policy\r\ntowards rustic life and agriculture. As he persuaded and pressed the\r\nrich to be less selfish[811] and more public-spirited, to spend less\r\non ostentation and the adornment of their mansions and parks, and to\r\ncontribute liberally to works of public magnificence or utility, a\r\nduty now long neglected; even so he strove to rebuild Italian farming,\r\nto make it what it had been of yore, the seed-bed of simple civic\r\nand military virtues. But ancient civilization, in the course of its\r\ndevelopment in the Roman empire, had now gone too far for any ruler,\r\nhowever well-meaning and powerful, to turn the tide. Socially it was\r\ntoo concentrated and urban, economically too individualistic and too\r\ndependent on the manipulation of masses of capital. In many directions\r\nthe policy of the judicious emperor was marvellously successful: but he\r\ndid not succeed in reviving agriculture on the old traditional footing\r\nas a nursery of peasant farmers. He sought to bring back a traditional\r\ngolden age, and court-poets were willing to assert[812] that the golden\r\nage had indeed returned. This was not true. The ever-repeated praises\r\nof country life are unreal. Even when sincere, they are the voice of\r\ntown-bred men, weary of the fuss and follies of urban life, to which\r\nnevertheless they would presently come back refreshed but bored[813]\r\nwith their rural holiday. That the science and art of agriculture were\r\nbeing improved, is true; hence the treatise of Varro, written in his old\r\nage. But technical improvements could not set the small farmers as a\r\nclass on their legs again. The small man’s vantage lay (and still lies)\r\nin minute care and labour freely bestowed, without stopping to inquire\r\nwhether the percentage of profit is or is not an adequate return for\r\nhis toil. Moreover, technical improvements often require the command of\r\nconsiderable capital. The big man can sink capital and await a return on\r\nthe investment: but this return must be at a minimum rate or he will feel\r\nthat it does not ‘pay.’ For in his calculations he cannot help comparing\r\nthe returns[814] on different kinds of investments.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions it is no wonder that we find _latifundia_ still\r\nexisting under the early Empire in districts suited for the plantation\r\nsystem. No doubt much of the large landholding was the outcome of social\r\nambitions. Men who had taken advantage of civil war and its sequels to\r\nsink money in land took their profit either in a good percentage on\r\nplantations, or in the enhanced importance gained by owning fine country\r\nplaces, or in both ways. A new class was coming to the front under the\r\nimperial régime and among them were wealthy freedmen. These had not yet\r\nreached the predominant influence and colossal wealth that marked their\r\nsuccessors of the next generation. But they had begun to appear[815]\r\nin the last age of the Republic, and were now a force by no means to\r\nbe ignored. Such landowners were not likely to favour the revival of\r\npeasant farmers, unless the presence of the latter could be utilized\r\nin the interest of the big estates. There were two ways in which this\r\nresult could be attained. A small freeholder might, from the small size\r\nof his farm, have some spare time, and be willing to turn it to account\r\nby working elsewhere for wages. Such a man would be a labourer of the\r\nvery best kind, but he could not be relied upon to be disengaged at a\r\nparticular moment; for, if not busy just then on his own farm, some other\r\nemployer might have secured his services. A small tenant farmer, to whom\r\npart of a great estate was let, would be governed by any conditions\r\nagreed upon between him and his landlord. That these conditions might\r\ninclude a liability to a certain amount of actual service at certain\r\nseasons on his landlord’s estate, is obvious. That the _coloni_ of later\r\ntimes were normally in this position, is well known. That this system,\r\nunder which a tenant retaining personal freedom was practically (and at\r\nlength legally) bound to the soil, suddenly arose and became effective,\r\nis most improbable. Whether we can detect any signs of its gradual\r\nintroduction will appear as our inquiry proceeds. We have already noted\r\nthe few references to tenant _coloni_ under the Republic. It is enough to\r\nremark here that, whatever degree of improvement in agriculture may have\r\ntaken place owing to the reestablishment of peace and order, it could\r\nhardly have been brought about without employing the best labour to be\r\nhad. If therefore we find reason to believe that the supply of skilled\r\nfree labour for special agricultural work was gradually found by giving\r\na new turn to the tenancy-system, we may hazard a guess that the first\r\ntentative steps in this direction belong to the quiet developments of the\r\nAugustan peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROME—THE EMPIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII. AGRICULTURE AND AGRICULTURAL LABOUR UNDER THE ROMAN EMPIRE.\r\nGENERAL INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nThat the position of the working farmer in the fourth and fifth centuries\r\nAD was very different from what it had been in the early days of the\r\nRoman Republic, is hardly open to question. That in the last two\r\ncenturies of the Republic his position had been gravely altered for the\r\nworse in a large (and that in general the best) part of Italy, is not\r\nless certain. This period, from 241 to 31 BC, had seen the subjection\r\nto Rome of the Mediterranean countries, and the Italian peninsula was\r\nan imperial land. It was inevitable that from a dominion so vast and\r\nvarious there should be some sort of reaction on its mistress, and\r\nreaction there had been, mostly for evil, on the victorious Roman state.\r\nThe political social and moral effects of this reaction do not concern\r\nus here save only in so far as the economic situation was affected\r\nthereby. For instance, the plunder of the Provinces by bad governors\r\nand the extortions practised by subordinate officials, the greed of\r\nfinanciers and their agents, were the chief sources of the immense sums\r\nof money that poured into Italy. The corruption promoted by all this\r\nill-gotten wealth expressed itself in many forms; but in no way was it\r\nmore effective than in degradation of agriculture. It was not merely that\r\nit forwarded the movement towards great aggregations of _latifundia_.\r\nIt supplied the means of controlling politics by bribery and violence\r\nand rendering nugatory all endeavours to reform the land-system and\r\ngive legislative remedies a fair trial. The events of the revolutionary\r\nperiod left nearly all the land of Italy in private ownership, most of\r\nit in the hands of large owners. The Sullan and Triumviral confiscations\r\nand assignations were social calamities and economic failures. Of their\r\nparalysing effect on agriculture we can only form a general notion, but\r\nit is clear that no revival of a free farming peasantry took place.\r\n\r\nChanges there had been in agriculture, due to influences from abroad.\r\nFarming on a large scale and organization of slave labour had given it\r\nan industrial turn. The crude and brutal form in which this at first\r\nappeared had probably been somewhat modified by experience. The great\r\nplantations clumsily adapted from Punic models were not easily made to\r\npay. More variety in crops became the fashion, and the specializing\r\nof labour more necessary. In this we may surely trace Greek and\r\nGreco-oriental influences, and the advance in this respect is reflected\r\nin the more scientific precepts of Varro as compared with those of Cato.\r\nBut, so long as the industrial aim, the raising of large crops for the\r\nurban market, prevailed, this change could not tend to revive the farming\r\npeasantry, whose aim was primarily an independent subsistence, and who\r\nlacked the capital needed for agricultural enterprise on industrial\r\nlines. Meanwhile there was the large-scale slavery system firmly\r\nestablished, and nothing less than shrinkage of the supply of slaves was\r\nlikely to shake it.\r\n\r\nBut the course of Roman conquest and formation of Provinces had brought\r\nItaly into contact with countries in which agriculture and its relation\r\nto governments stood on a very different footing from that traditional\r\nin Roman Italy. The independent peasant farmer living by his own labour\r\non his own land, a double character of citizen and soldier, untroubled\r\nby official interference, was a type not present to the eyes of Romans\r\nas they looked abroad. Tribal ownership, still common in the West, had\r\nbeen outgrown in Italy. The Carthaginian system, from which much had\r\nbeen learnt, was an exploitation-system, as industrial as a government\r\nof merchant princes could make it. In Sicily it met a Hellenistic system\r\nset up by the rulers of Syracuse, and the two seem to have blended or\r\nat least to have had common characteristics. The normal feature was\r\nthe payment of a tithe of produce (δεκάτη) to the State. For the State\r\nclaimed the property of the land, and reserved to itself a regular 10%\r\nin acknowledgement thereof. This royal title had passed to Rome, and\r\nRome accordingly levied her normal _decumae_, exemption from which was\r\na special favour granted to a few communities. Now the principle that\r\nthe ultimate ownership of land is vested in the King[816] was well known\r\nin the East, and is to be traced in several of the monarchies founded\r\nby the Successors of Alexander. In the Seleucid and Attalid kingdoms\r\nthere have been found indications of it, though the privileges of cities\r\nand temples checked its general application. But in Egypt it existed in\r\nfull vigour, and had done so from time immemorial. It was in fact the\r\nmost essential expression of oriental ideas of sovranty. Combined with\r\nit was the reservation of certain areas as peculiarly ‘royal lands’ the\r\ncultivators of which were ‘royal farmers,’ βασιλικοὶ γεωργοί, standing\r\nin a direct relation to the King and controlled by his administrative\r\nofficials. The interest of the sovran was to extract a regular revenue\r\nfrom the crown-lands: hence it was the aim of government to secure the\r\nresidence of its farmers and the continuous cultivation of the soil. The\r\nobject was attained by minute regulations applied to a submissive people\r\nof small needs.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that agriculture under conditions such as these was based\r\non ideas fundamentally different from those prevalent in Italy. There\r\nprivate ownership was the rule, and by the end of the Republic it was so\r\nmore than ever. The _latifundia_ had grown by transfers of property[817]\r\nin land, whether the holdings so absorbed were original small freeholds\r\nor allotments of state land granted under agrarian laws. Present estates,\r\nwhether large or small, were normally held under a full proprietary\r\ntitle; and the large ones at least were valued as an asset of social and\r\npolitical importance rather than as a source of economic profit. The\r\nowner could do what he would with his own, and in Italy[818] there was\r\nno tax-burden on his land. We may ask how it came about that the Italian\r\nand Provincial systems stood thus side by side, neither assimilating\r\nthe other. The answer is that the contrast suited the interests of the\r\nmoneyed classes who controlled the government of Rome. To exploit the\r\nregal conditions taken over by the Republic abroad was for them a direct\r\nroad to riches, and the gratification of their ambitions was achieved\r\nby the free employment of their riches at home. The common herd of poor\r\ncitizens, pauperized in Rome or scattered in country towns and hamlets,\r\nhad no effective means of influencing policy, even if they understood\r\nwhat was going on and had (which they had not) an alternative policy of\r\ntheir own. So the Empire took over from the Republic a system existing\r\nfor the benefit of hostile aristocrats and capitalists, with whom it was\r\nnot practicable to dispense and whom it was not easy to control.\r\n\r\nWe cannot suppose that the classes concerned with agriculture had any\r\nsuspicion how far-reaching were the changes destined to come about under\r\nthe new government. They could not look centuries ahead. For the present,\r\nthe ruler spared no pains to dissemble his autocratic power and pose as\r\na preserver and restorer of the Past. Caution and a judicious patronage\r\ninspired literature to praise the government and to observe a discreet\r\nsilence on unwelcome topics. The attitude of Augustus towards agriculture\r\nwill be discussed below. Here it is only necessary to remark that the\r\nfirst aim of his policy in this as in other departments was to set the\r\nmachine working with the least possible appearance of change. As the\r\nrepublican magistracies were left standing, and gradually failed through\r\nthe incompetence of senatorial guidance, so no crude agrarian schemes\r\nwere allowed to upset existing conditions, and development was left to\r\nfollow the lines of changing economic and political needs. It is well to\r\ntake a few important matters and see very briefly how imperial policy set\r\ngoing tendencies that were in course of time to affect profoundly the\r\nposition of agriculture.\r\n\r\nIn the first place it was clear that no stable reconstruction was\r\npossible without a large and steady income. To this end a great reform of\r\nthe old methods of revenue-collection was necessary. The wasteful system\r\nof tax-farmers practically unchecked in their exactions was exchanged for\r\ncollection by officials of the state or of municipalities. In the case of\r\nland-revenue this change was especially momentous, for in no department\r\nhad the abuses and extortions of _publicani_ been more oppressive. And\r\nit was in the Emperor’s Provinces that this reform was first achieved.\r\nAgriculture was by far the most widespread occupation of the subject\r\npeoples; and the true imperial interest was, not to squeeze the most\r\npossible out of them at a given moment, but to promote their continuous\r\nwellbeing as producers of a moderate but sure revenue. That this wise\r\npolicy was deliberately followed is indicated by the separate[819]\r\ntreatment of Egypt. Augustus did not present his new acquisition to\r\nthe Roman state. He stepped into the position of the late Ptolemies,\r\nand was king there without the name. As he found the cash of Ptolemaic\r\ntreasure a means of paying off debts and avoiding initial bankruptcy,\r\nso by keeping up the existing financial system he enjoyed year by year\r\na large income entirely at his own disposal, and avoided the risk of\r\ndisturbing institutions to which the native farmers had been used from\r\ntime immemorial. The possession of this vast private revenue undoubtedly\r\nhad much to do with the successful career of Augustus in establishing the\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nSo long as the empire was secure from invasion, and the collection of\r\ntaxes on a fair and economical plan afforded sufficient and regular\r\nreturns, general prosperity prevailed over a larger area than ever\r\nbefore. The boon of peace was to the subject peoples a compensation for\r\nthe loss of an independence the advantages of which were uncertain and in\r\nmost cases probably forgotten. If the benumbing of national feelings was\r\nin itself not a good thing, the central government was able to pay its\r\nway, and emperors could at need appear as a sort of benign providence,\r\nby grants of money or temporary remissions of taxation in relief of\r\nextraordinary calamities. And yet, as we can now see in retrospect, the\r\nestablishment of the new monarchy had set in motion tendencies that\r\nwere destined to upset the social and economic structure and eventually\r\nto give it a more Oriental character. Italy long remained a favoured\r\nmetropolitan land. But the great landowning nobles no longer ruled it\r\nand the Provinces also. No dissembling could conceal the truth that\r\ntheir political importance was gone. It may be[820] that some of the\r\ngreat landlords gave more attention to their estates as economic units.\r\nIt is much more certain that large-scale landholding abroad[821] was\r\nmore attractive than that in Italy. It was not a new thing, and under\r\nthe republican government great provincial Roman landlords had enjoyed\r\na sort of local autocratic position, assured by their influence in\r\nRome. But an emperor’s point of view was very different from that of\r\nthe old republican Senate. He could not allow the formation of local\r\nprincipalities in the form of great estates under no effective control.\r\nThese landlords had been bitter opponents of Julius Caesar: Augustus\r\nhad been driven to make away with some of them: the uneasiness of his\r\nsuccessors at length found full vent in the action of Nero, who put to\r\ndeath six great landlords in Africa, and confiscated their estates. Half\r\nAfrica, the Province specially affected, thus passed into the category of\r\nImperial Domains, under the control of a departmental bureau, and later\r\ntimes added more and more to these _praedia Caesaris_ in many parts of\r\nthe empire.\r\n\r\nThe convenient simplicity of having great areas of productive land\r\nadministered by imperial agents more or less controlled by the officials\r\nof a central department, into which the yearly dues were regularly paid,\r\ncannot have escaped the notice of emperors. But the advantages of such a\r\nsystem had been a part of their actual experience[822] from the first in\r\nthe case of Egypt. Egypt too was the special home of finance based on a\r\nsystem of regulated agriculture and hereditary continuity of occupation.\r\nIn particular, the interest of the government in the maintenance and\r\nextension of cultivation was expressed in minute rules for land-tenure\r\nand dues payable, and the care taken to keep the class of ‘royal farmers’\r\nin a prosperous condition. Thus there was recognized a sort of community\r\nof interest between peasant and king. That middlemen should not oppress\r\nthe former or defraud the latter was a common concern of both. Now in\r\nthe Roman empire we note the growth of a system resembling this in its\r\nchief features. We find the tillage of imperial domains[823] carried on\r\nby small farmers holding parcels of land, generally as sub-tenants of\r\ntenants-in-chief holding direct from the emperor. These small farmers\r\nwere evidently workers, whether they to some extent used slave-labour\r\nor not. Imperial policy favoured these men as steady producers turning\r\nthe land to good account, and thus adding to the resources of the empire\r\nwithout being (like great landlords) a possible source of danger. Hence\r\ngreat care was taken to protect the _coloni Caesaris_ from oppression\r\nby middlemen: and, so long as head-tenants and official agents did not\r\ncorruptly combine to wrong the farmers, the protection seems to have been\r\neffective. Moreover, the advantage of retaining the same tenants on the\r\nland whose conditions they understood by experience, and of inducing them\r\nto reclaim and improve further portions of the waste, was kept clearly in\r\nview. A policy of official encouragement in these directions was in full\r\nswing in the second century AD and may perhaps have been initiated by\r\nVespasian.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to assume that these arrangements were directly\r\ncopied from Oriental, particularly Egyptian, conditions. The convenience\r\nof permanent tenants and the ever-pressing need of food-supply are\r\nenough to account for the general aim, and experience of the East would\r\nnaturally help to mature the policy. The establishment of the Empire\r\nmade it possible. But we must plainly note the significance of new ideas\r\nin respect of residence and cultivation. In the Roman land-system of\r\nItaly private ownership was the rule, and the general assumption that\r\nthe owner cultivated on his own account: stewards and slave-gangs were\r\ncommon but not essential phenomena. It is true that the practice of\r\nletting farms to cultivating tenants existed, and that in the first two\r\ncenturies of the Empire it was on the increase, probably promoted by\r\nthe comparative scarcity of slaves in times of peace. But tenancy was a\r\ncontract-relation, and the law, while protecting the tenant, gave to the\r\nlandlord ample means of enforcing regular and thorough cultivation. And\r\nthis automatically ensured the tenant’s residence in any conditions short\r\nof final despair. We shall see that as agriculture declined in Italy it\r\nbecame more and more difficult to find and keep satisfactory tenants: but\r\nthe tenant was in the last resort free to go, and the man who had to be\r\ncompelled to cultivate properly was just the man on whom the use of legal\r\nremedies was least likely to produce the desired practical effect. Now\r\non the imperial domains abroad we find a growing tendency to insist on\r\nresidence, as a rule imposed from above. The emperor could not leave his\r\n_coloni_ simply at the mercy of his head-tenants. He was very ready to\r\nprotect them, but to have them flitting at will was another matter. And\r\nthis tendency surely points to Egyptian analogies; naturally too, as the\r\nEmpire was becoming more definitely a Monarchy.\r\n\r\nWe shall also find reason to think that both in Italy and in the\r\nProvinces there was a tendency to reduce farm-tenants to a considerable\r\ndegree of _de facto_ dependence by manipulation of economic relations.\r\nA landlord could let a farm on terms apparently favourable but so\r\narranged that it was easy for the tenant to fall into arrears and\r\nbecome his debtor. The exploitation of debtors’ necessities[824] was a\r\npractice traditionally Roman from very early times. True, it was seldom\r\npolitic to sell up a defaulting tenant in the declining state of Italian\r\nagriculture. But the gradual acceptance of a liability to small burdens\r\nin lieu of cash payment might rob him of his effective independence\r\nbefore he was well aware of the change in his position. On a great\r\nprovincial domain, the emperor being far away, a head-tenant could deal\r\nwith the sub-tenants on much the same lines. A trifling requirement,\r\njust exceeding what was actually due, would be submitted to as not worth\r\nthe trouble and risk of setting the appeal-machinery in motion. Further\r\nencroachments, infinitesimal but cumulative, might reduce the _colonus_\r\nto a semi-servile condition: and, the poorer he became, the less his\r\nprospect of protection from the emperor’s local agents, too often men\r\nof itching palms. Still the _coloni_ were freemen, and we have evidence\r\nthat they sometimes appealed to their imperial lord, and with success.\r\nIt seems that in some respects _coloni Caesaris_ were at an advantage\r\nas compared with _coloni_ of private landlords, at least in the means\r\nof protection. Roman law was very chary of interference with matters of\r\nprivate contract, and the principles guiding the courts were well known.\r\nAn astute landlord could see to it that his encroachments on a tenant’s\r\nfreedom did not entitle the man to a legal remedy. But the imperial\r\ndomains abroad were often, if not always, governed by administrative\r\nprocedure under the emperor’s own agents; and these gentry could quickly\r\nbe brought to order, and compelled to redress grievances, by a single\r\nword from headquarters. That the word was forthcoming on occasion is\r\nnot wonderful. The policy of an emperor was to cherish and encourage\r\nthe patient farmers whose economic value was a sound imperial asset,\r\nwhile the head-tenant was only a convenient middleman. But the private\r\nlandowner had no imperial interest to guide him, and looked only to his\r\nown immediate profit.\r\n\r\nIn tracing the influences that changed the condition of the working\r\nfarmer we must not forget the establishment of a new military system.\r\nThe standing army created by Augustus was an absolute necessity for\r\nimperial defence. At the same time it was a recognition of the fact\r\nthat the old system of temporary levies, long proved inadequate, must\r\nhenceforth be abandoned. Frontier armies could not be formed by simply\r\nmobilizing free peasants for a campaign. The strength of the armies lay\r\nin military skill, not in numbers. Long service and special training made\r\nthem uniformly professional, and provision was duly made for regular\r\nconditions of retirement. The Italian peasant-farmers, much fewer than of\r\nyore, and no longer all potential soldiers, were left to become simply\r\nprofessional farmers. That agriculture nevertheless did not really\r\nprosper was due to causes beyond their control; but that they, both\r\ntenant _coloni_ and any remaining small owners, should tend to become a\r\npurely peasant class was inevitable. Augustus may have wished to rebuild\r\nItalian agriculture on a sound foundation of the peasant-elements,\r\nbut circumstances were too contrary for the successful prosecution of\r\nany such design. Meanwhile the marked differentiation[825] of soldier\r\nand farmer, and the settlement of veterans on allotments of land,\r\nmainly in frontier Provinces, was proceeding. Analogies from the East,\r\nparticularly from Egypt, where such arrangements[826] were traditional,\r\ncan hardly have been ignored. In ancient Egypt the division of military\r\nand farming classes had been so marked as to present the appearance of a\r\ncaste-system. But this was not peculiar to Egypt. It was in full vigour\r\nin ancient India, where it impressed[827] Greek observers, to whom the\r\ngeneral absence of slaves, there as in Egypt, seemed one of its notable\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nI do not venture to suggest that Roman emperors set themselves\r\ndeliberately to substitute a fixed attachment of working farmers to\r\nthe soil for a failing system of rustic slave-labour. But it is not\r\nlikely that, as labour-problems from time to time arose, the well-known\r\nOriental solutions were without some influence on their policy. We\r\nmust not forget that Greek thinkers had long ago approved the plan of\r\nstrict differentiation of functions in ideal states, and that such\r\nnotions, popularized in Latin, were common property in educated circles.\r\nTradition[828] even pointed to the existence of some such differentiation\r\nin primitive Rome. Therefore, when we find under the later Empire a\r\nrigid system of castes and gilds, and the _coloni_ attached to the soil\r\nwith stern penalties to hinder movement, we must not view the situation\r\nwith modern eyes. The restraint, that to us seems a cruel numbing of\r\nforces vital to human progress, would come as no great shock to the world\r\nof the fourth century, long prepared for the step by experience not\r\nencountered by theory. To us it is a painful revolution that, instead\r\nof the land belonging to the cultivator, the cultivator had become an\r\nappendage of the land. But it was the outcome of a long process: as for\r\nprogress in any good sense, it had ceased. Government had become a series\r\nof vain expedients to arrest decay. And the rule of fixed _origo_, a\r\nman’s officially fixed domicile, was nothing more than the doctrine of\r\nthe ἰδία long prevalent in the East.\r\n\r\nThe true significance of the change binding the tiller to the soil he\r\ntilled is to be found in the fact that it was a desperate effort to\r\nsolve a labour-question. To secure a sufficient supply of food had\r\nbeen a cause of anxiety to the imperial government from the first. The\r\nencouragement of increased production had become an important part of\r\nimperial policy in the second century. It looked to the small working\r\nfarmers as the chief producing agency, men who provided all or most\r\nof the labour on their farms, and in at least some cases a certain\r\namount of task-work[829] on the larger farms of the head-tenants. But\r\nin the wars and utter confusion of the third century the strain on the\r\nsystem was too great. The peaceful and prosperous parts of the empire\r\nsuffered from increased demands on their resources to make good the\r\ndeficiencies of the Provinces troubled with invasions or rebellions.\r\nAnd there can be no doubt that the working of governmental departments\r\nwas interrupted and impeded by the general disorder. In such times as\r\nthose of Gallienus and the so-called Thirty Tyrants the protection of\r\nthe small farmers by intervention of the central authority must have\r\nbeen pitifully ineffective. Naturally enough, we do not get direct\r\nrecord of this failure, but the change of conditions that followed on\r\nthe restoration of order by Diocletian shews what had been happening.\r\nThe increase of taxation, rendered necessary by the costly machinery\r\nof the new government, led to increased pressure on the farmers, and\r\nevasions had to be checked by increased restraints. In a few years the\r\nfacts were recognized and stereotyped by the law of Constantine, and\r\nthe _coloni_ were henceforth bound down to the soil by an act of state.\r\nAnother notable change[830] was introduced by requiring payment of dues\r\nto be made in kind. The motive of this was to provide a certain means of\r\nsupporting the armies and the elaborate civil service; for the currency,\r\nmiserably debased in the course of the third century, was a quite\r\nunsuitable medium for the purpose. That Diocletian, in these institutions\r\nof a new model, was not consciously applying oriental usage to the empire\r\ngenerally, is hardly credible. It only remained to reduce Italy to the\r\ncommon level by subjecting Italian land to taxation. This he did, and the\r\nnew Oriental Monarchy was complete.\r\n\r\nThat a labour-question underlay the policy of attaching the _coloni_\r\nto the land, is to be gathered from the following considerations. The\r\ndevelopment of the plan of promoting small tenancies, particularly on\r\nthe imperial domains, was undoubtedly calculated to take the place of\r\nlarge-scale cultivation by slave labour. It was a move in the direction\r\nof more intensive tillage, and economically sound. So long as a firm hand\r\nwas kept on large head-tenants and imperial officials, the plan seems to\r\nhave been on the whole a success. But all depended on the protection of\r\nthe small working farmers, and of course on the moderation of government\r\ndemands. The disorders of the third century tended to paralyse the\r\nprotection while they increased demands. Therefore the head-tenants,\r\naided by the slackness or collusion of officials, gained a predominant\r\npower, which imperial policy had been concerned to prevent. By the time\r\nof Diocletian their position was far stronger than it had been under\r\nHadrian. To restore the former relations by governmental action would\r\nbe certainly difficult, perhaps impossible. As middlemen, through whose\r\nagency the collection of dues in non-municipal areas could be effected,\r\nthey were useful. It was a saving of trouble to deal with a comparatively\r\nsmall number of persons, and those men of substance. The remodelling\r\nof the disordered Empire was no doubt a complicated and laborious\r\nbusiness, and anything that promised to save trouble would be welcomed.\r\nSo the government accepted[831] the changed position as accomplished\r\nfact, and left the _coloni_, its former clients, to the mercies of the\r\nmen of capital. But the big men, controlling ever more lands, whether\r\nas possessors or as imperial head-tenants or as ‘patrons’ of helpless\r\nvillagers, could not meet their obligations to the government without\r\nhaving the disposal of a sufficient and regular supply of labour. And to\r\nthe authorities of the later Empire, deeply committed to a rigid system\r\nof castes and gilds, no way of meeting the difficulty seemed open but\r\nto extend the system of fixity to the class of toilers on the land. The\r\nmotive was a financial one, naturally. Non-industrial, and so unable to\r\npay for imports by export of its own manufactures, the civilization of\r\nthe empire was financially based upon agriculture. Looking back on the\r\npast, we can see that the deadening of hope and enterprise in the farming\r\npopulation was a ruinous thing. But the empire drifted into it as the\r\nresult of circumstances and influences long operative and eventually\r\nirresistible. To displace the free peasant by the slave, then the slave\r\nby the small tenant, only to end by converting the small tenant into a\r\nserf, was a part of the Roman fate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROME—AUGUSTUS TO NERO\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX. HORACE AND VERGIL.\r\n\r\nFor literary evidence bearing on agriculture in the time of Augustus\r\nwe naturally look to Vergil and Horace. Now these two witnesses, taken\r\nseparately and construed literally, might convey very different, even\r\ninconsistent, impressions of farm life and labour in the world around\r\nthem. And Vergil is the central figure of Roman literature, the poet who\r\nabsorbed the products of the past and dominated those of many generations\r\nto come. His quality as a witness to the present is what concerns us\r\nhere. I have tried to discuss this problem thoroughly and fairly in a\r\nspecial section. In order to do this, it has been necessary to deal _pari\r\npassu_ with most of the evidence of Horace, the rest of which can be\r\ntreated first by itself.\r\n\r\n=Horace=, the freedman’s son, himself an illustration of the way in which\r\nthe ranks of Roman citizenship were being recruited from foreign sources,\r\nyields to none in his admiration of the rustic Romans of old[832] and the\r\nmanly virtues of the genuine stock. In the dialogue between himself and\r\nhis slave Davus the latter is made to twit him with his praises of the\r\nsimple life and manners of the commons of yore, though he would never be\r\ncontent to live as they did. A palpable hit, as Horace knew: but he did\r\nnot change his tone. With due respect he speaks of the farmers of olden\r\ntime, men of sturdy mould and few wants. It was as poor men on small\r\nhereditary farms[833] that M’ Curius and Camillus grew to be champions\r\nof Rome. In those far-off days the citizen might have little of his\r\nown, but the public treasury[834] was full; a sharp contrast to present\r\nselfishness and greedy land-grabbing. Those old farmer folk put their own\r\nhand to the work. Their sons were brought up to a daily round of heavy\r\ntasks, and the mother of such families[835] was a strict ruler and an\r\nactive housewife. For the scale of all their operations was small, and\r\npersonal labour their chief means of attaining limited ends. They are not\r\nrepresented as using slave labour, nor is the omission strange. For the\r\nmilitary needs of the great world-empire were never far from the minds of\r\nthe Augustan writers, conscious as they were of their master’s anxieties\r\non this score. Now the typical peasant of old time was farmer and soldier\r\ntoo, and it is of the _rusticorum mascula militum proles_ that Horace is\r\nthinking. There was no need to refer to farm-slaves even in the case of\r\nRegulus[836], whom tradition evidently assumed to have been a slaveowner.\r\nBut, when he refers to circumstances of his own day, the slave meets us\r\neverywhere; not only in urban life and the domestic circle, but on the\r\nfarm and in the contractor’s[837] labour-gang. We then hear of great\r\nestates, of great blocks of land mostly forest (_saltus_)[838] bought up\r\nby the rich, of the sumptuous _villae_ of the new style, all implying\r\nmasses of slave labour: also of the great estates outside[839] Italy,\r\nfrom which speculators were already drawing incomes.\r\n\r\nSide by side with these scenes of aggressive opulence, we find occasional\r\nmention of a poorer class, farming small holdings, who are sometimes\r\nrepresented[840] as cultivators of land inherited from their forefathers.\r\nHow far we are to take these references literally, that is as evidence\r\nthat such persons were ordinary figures in the rustic life of Italy,\r\nmay be doubted. The poet in need of material for contrasts, which are\r\ninevitably part of his stock-in-trade, has little in common with the\r\nstatistician or even the stolid reporter. Nor can we be sure that the man\r\nwho ‘works his paternal farm with oxen of his own’ or ‘delights to cleave\r\nhis ancestral fields with the mattock,’ are workers doing the bodily\r\nlabour in person. Even Horace, inclined though he is to realism, cannot\r\nbe trusted so far: such words[841] as _arat_ and _aedificat_ for instance\r\ndo not necessarily mean that the man guides the plough or is his own\r\nmason or carpenter. When he speaks of ‘all that the tireless Apulian[842]\r\nploughs’—that is, the harvests he raises by ploughing—he does not seem\r\nto have in mind the small farmer. For the context clearly suggests corn\r\nraised on a large scale. And yet elsewhere[843] he gives us a picture of\r\nan Apulian peasant whose hard toil is cheered and eased by the work and\r\nattentions of his sunburnt wife, a little ideal scene of rural bliss.\r\nApulia is a large district, and not uniform[844] in character, so we need\r\nnot assume that either of these passages misrepresents fact. And there\r\nis a noticeable difference between the style of the Satires and Epistles\r\non the one hand and that of the Odes on the other. In vocabulary, as\r\nin metre and rhythm, the former enjoy an easy license denied to the\r\nseverer lyric poems on which he stakes his strictly poetic reputation.\r\nIn the Odes[845] for instance _colonus_ bears the old general sense\r\n‘tiller of the soil’: in the Satires we find it in the legal sense of\r\n‘tenant-farmer’ as opposed to ‘owner,’ _dominus_. He refers in both\r\ngroups of poems to the military colonists[846] pensioned by Augustus\r\nwith grants of land. In neither place is the word _coloni_ used; this\r\nis natural enough. We need only note the care with which the court-poet\r\nrefers to the matter. His master doubtless had many an anxious hour over\r\nthat settlement: the poet refers to the granting of lands, and does\r\nnot touch on the disturbance caused thereby. Nor is Horace peculiar in\r\nthis respect. The caution that marks the utterances of all the Augustan\r\nwriters is very apt to mislead us when we try to form a notion of the\r\nactual situation. The general truth seems to be that the beginning of\r\nthe Empire was a time of unrest tempered by exhaustion, and that things\r\nonly calmed down gradually as the sufferers of the elder generation died\r\nout. Wealth was now the one aim of most ambitions, and the race to escape\r\npoverty was extreme. The merchant[847] in Horace is a typical figure. For\r\na while he may have had enough of seafaring perils and turn with joy to\r\nthe rural quiet of his country town: but to vegetate on narrow means is\r\nmore than he can stand, and he is off to the seas again. He is contrasted\r\nwith the farmer content to till his ancestral fields, whom no prospect of\r\ngain would tempt to face the dangers of the deep: and he is I believe a\r\nmuch more average representative of the age than the acquiescent farmer.\r\n\r\nOne passage in the works of Horace calls for special discussion by\r\nitself, for the value of its evidence depends on the interpretation\r\naccepted, and opinions have differed. In the fourteenth epistle of the\r\nfirst book the poet expresses his preference for country life in the form\r\nof an address to the steward of his Sabine estate, beginning with these\r\nlines\r\n\r\n    _Vilice silvarum et mihi me reddentis agelli,_\r\n    _quem tu fastidis habitatum quinque focis et_\r\n    _quinque bonos solitum Variam dimittere patres,_\r\n\r\nthus rendered by Howes\r\n\r\n    Dear Bailiff of the woody wild domain\r\n    Whose peace restores me to myself again,—\r\n    (A sprightlier scene, it seems, thy taste requires,\r\n    To Varia though it send five sturdy sires\r\n    The lords of five good households)—\r\n\r\nand the question at once arises, what sort of persons are meant by these\r\n‘five good fathers.’ In agreement with the excellent note of Wilkins I\r\nhold that they are free heads of households, and that they are persons\r\nexisting in the then present time, not imagined figures of a former\r\nage. It seems also clear that they were living on the modest estate\r\n(_agellus_) of Horace. If so, then they can hardly be other than tenants\r\nof farms included therein. Therefore it has naturally been inferred that\r\nthe estate consisted of a _villa_ with a home-farm managed by a steward\r\ncontrolling the staff of eight slaves of whom we hear elsewhere: and that\r\nthe outlying portions were let to free farmers[848] on terms of money\r\nrent or shares of produce. Horace would thus be the landlord of five\r\n_coloni_, and his relations with them would normally be kept up through\r\nthe agency of the resident slave-steward of the home-farm. All this\r\nagrees perfectly with other evidence as to the customary arrangements\r\nfollowed on rural estates; and I accept it as a valuable illustration\r\nof a system not new but tending to become more and more prevalent as\r\ntime went on. But it is well to note that the case is one from a hill\r\ndistrict, and that we must not from it draw any inference as to how\r\nthings were moving on the great lowland estates, the chief latifundial\r\nfarm-areas of Italy.\r\n\r\nThe _patres_ referred to are virtually _patres familias_[849], free\r\nresponsible persons, probably Roman citizens, but tenants, not landowning\r\nyeomen of the ancient type. Whether their visits to Varia (Vicovaro)\r\nwere to bear their part in the local affairs of their market-town, or\r\nto buy and sell, or for both purposes, is not quite clear; nor does it\r\nhere concern us. But we should much like to know whether these five\r\nfarmers, or some of them, employed[850] any slaves. I do not see how this\r\ncuriosity is to be gratified. Perhaps we may argue that their assumed\r\nliberty to come and go points to the employment of some labour other\r\nthan their own: but would this labour be slave or free? If we assume (as\r\nI think we fairly may) that the labour needed would be mainly regular\r\nroutine-work and not occasional help, this points rather to slave-labour.\r\nNor is there any general reason for distrusting that conclusion; only it\r\nwould probably mean slave-labour on a small scale. There is moreover no\r\nreason to think that free wage-labourers for regular routine work were\r\nplentiful in the Sabine hills. And these small farmers were not likely to\r\nbe creditors, served by debtors (_obaerati_) working off arrears of debt,\r\na class of labour which according to Varro seems to have been no longer\r\navailable in Italy. There I must leave this question, for I can add no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nIt remains to ask whether the identification of _patres_ with _patres\r\nfamilias_ exhausts the full meaning of the word. In the _Aeneid_ (XII\r\n520) a combatant slain is described as by craft a poor fisherman\r\nof Lerna, no dependant of the wealthy, and then follow the words\r\n_conductaque pater tellure serebat_. Now most commentators and\r\ntranslators seem determined to find in this a reference to the man’s\r\nfather, which is surely flat and superfluous. The stress is not on\r\n_pater_ but on _conducta_. Is not _pater_ an honourable quality-term,\r\nreferring to the man[851] himself? He would not be always fishing in the\r\nlake. He had a dwelling of some sort, most probably a patch of land, to\r\ngrow his vegetables. The point is that even this was not his own, but\r\nhired from some landowner. I would render ‘and the land where the honest\r\nman used to grow a crop from seed was rented from another.’ That _pater_\r\n(Aeneas etc) is often used as a complimentary prefix, is well known,\r\nand I think it delicately expresses the poet’s kindly appreciation of\r\nthe poor but honest and independent rustic. In the passage of Horace I\r\nam inclined to detect something of the same flavour. Some have supposed\r\nthat the five ‘fathers’ were decurions of the local township of Varia,\r\nwho went thither to meetings of the local senate. I shrink from reading\r\nthis into the words of Horace, all the more as Nissen[852] has shewn good\r\nreason for doubting whether Varia was anything more than a subordinate\r\nhamlet (_vicus_) of Tibur.\r\n\r\nThe general effect of the words, taken in context with the rest of\r\nthe epistle, is this: the _vilicus_, once a common slave-labourer\r\n(_mediastinus_) in Rome, hankers after town life, finding his rustic\r\nstewardship dull on a small estate such as that of Horace. To Horace\r\nthe place is a charming retreat from the follies and worries of Rome.\r\nTo him the estate with its quiet homestead and the five tenants of the\r\noutlying farms is an ideal property: he wants[853] a retreat, not urban\r\nexcitements. To the steward it seems that there is ‘nothing doing,’ while\r\nthe grandeur of a great estate is lacking. So the master is contented,\r\nwhile the slave is discontented, with this five-farm property looked at\r\nfrom their different points of view.\r\n\r\nBut the most serious problem that meets us in endeavouring to appraise\r\nthe evidence of the Augustan literature is connected with the _Georgics_\r\nof Vergil. Passages from Horace will be helpful in this inquiry, in the\r\ncourse of which the remarkable difference between these two witnesses\r\nwill appear. The stray references in other writers of the period are\r\nfor the most part not worth citing. =Tibullus= speaks of the farmer[854]\r\nwho has had his fill of steady ploughing, but this is in an ideal\r\npicture of the origins of agriculture. His rural scenes are not of much\r\nsignificance. In one place, speaking of hope[855] that sustains a man\r\nin uncertainties, for instance a farmer, he adds ‘Hope it is too that\r\ncomforts one bound with a strong chain: the iron clanks on his legs, yet\r\nhe sings as he works.’ A rustic slave, no doubt. But that his hope is\r\nhope of manumission is by no means clear: it may be hope of escape, and\r\nthe words are indefinite, perhaps left so purposely. That =Ovid=[856]\r\nrefers to the farmer statesmen and heroes of yore, who put their hands\r\nto the plough, is merely an illustration of the retrospective idealism\r\nof the Augustan age. Like Livy and the rest, he was conscious of the\r\ndecay of Roman vitality, and amid the glories and dissipations of Rome\r\nrecognized the vigour and simplicity of good old times. For him, and\r\nfor =Manilius=, speculation[857] as to the origins of civilization,\r\nimaginings of a primitive communism, had attraction, as it had for\r\nLucretius and Vergil. It was part of the common stock: and in connexion\r\nwith the development of building it forms a topic of some interest[858]\r\nin the _architectura_ of =Vitruvius=.\r\n\r\n=Vergil.= All readers of Vergil’s _Georgics_ are struck by the poet’s\r\npersistent glorification of labour and his insistence on the necessity\r\nand profit of personal action on the farmer’s part. Yet on one very\r\nimportant point there is singular obscurity. Is slave-labour meant to be\r\na part of his _res rustica_, or not? When he bids the farmer do this or\r\nthat, is he bidding him to do it with his own hands, or merely to see to\r\nthe doing of it, or sometimes the one and sometimes the other? So far as\r\nI know, no sufficient attention[859] has been given to the curious, and\r\nsurely deliberate, avoidance of direct reference to slavery in this poem.\r\nTo this subject I propose to return after considering the references\r\nin his pastoral and epic poetry. For in the artificial world of piping\r\nshepherds and in the surroundings of heroic legend the mention of slaves\r\nand slavery is under no restraint. This I hope to make clear; and, in\r\nrelation to the contrast presented by the _Georgics_, to emphasize, if\r\nnot satisfactorily to explain, one of the subtle reticencies of Vergil.\r\n\r\nThe _Bucolics_ place us in an unreal atmosphere. The scenic setting is a\r\nblend of Theocritean Sicily and the poet’s own lowlands of the Cisalpine.\r\nThe characters and status of the rustics are confused in a remarkable\r\ndegree. Thus in the first eclogue Tityrus appears as a slave who has\r\nbought his freedom late in life (lines 27-9), having neglected to amass a\r\n_peculium_ in earlier years (31-2). It was only by a visit to Rome, and\r\nthe favour of Octavian, that he gained relief. But this relief appears,\r\nnot as manumission, but as the restoration of a landowner dispossessed by\r\na military colonist. The inconsistency cannot be removed by treating the\r\nfirst version as symbolic or allegorical. It is there, and the poet seems\r\nto have felt no sufficient inducement to remove it. Corydon in the second\r\neclogue has a _dominus_, and is therefore _servus_ (2). Yet he boasts\r\nof his large property in flocks, which are presumably his _peculium_\r\n(19-22). His dwelling is a lowly cot in the rough grubby surroundings\r\nof the countryside (28-9). He is _pastor_ (1), but there are evidently\r\n_aratores_ on the estate (66). He is warned that, if it comes to buying\r\nfavours with gifts, he cannot compete with his master Iollas (57). Had he\r\nnot better do some basket-work and forget his passion (71-3)?\r\n\r\nIn the third eclogue the status of Damoetas is far from clear. He appears\r\nas _alienus custos_ of a flock, the love-rival of the owner (_ipse_),\r\nwhom he is robbing, profiting by the latter’s preoccupation with his\r\namour (1-6). He is in short head-shepherd (101 _pecoris magistro_), and\r\nTityrus (96) seems to be his underling. Menalcas in staking the cups\r\nexplains that he dare not risk any of the flock under his charge, which\r\nbelongs to his father and is jealously counted (32-43). He is owner’s\r\nson, with no opportunities of fraud; probably free, for we can hardly\r\nassume that the flock is a slave’s _peculium_. But whether Damoetas is\r\n(_a_) a free hireling or (_b_) a slave hired from another owner or (_c_)\r\na slave of the flock-owner, is not to be inferred with confidence from\r\nso indistinct a picture. In the ninth eclogue we are again[860] brought\r\nacross the rude military colonist (4) of the first eclogue. Moeris, who\r\nseems to be the steward of Menalcas, speaks of _nostri_ (_agelli_, 2)\r\nand _nostra_ (_carmina_, 12). Menalcas is _ipse_ (16), and supposed to\r\nrepresent Vergil. I incline to believe that Moeris is a slave _vilicus_,\r\nbut cannot feel sure. So also in the tenth, we hear of _opilio_ and\r\n_subulci_ (19), of _custos gregis_ and _vinitor_ (36). These would in the\r\nItaly of Vergil’s time be normally slaves. But it is not the question of\r\ntheir status that is uppermost in the poet’s mind. They appear in the\r\npicture merely as figures suggesting the rustic environment on which he\r\nloves to dwell. As for the fourth eclogue, it is only necessary to remark\r\nthat, however interpreted, it points to the return (6) of a blissful age,\r\nand accordingly assumes the former existence of good old times.\r\n\r\nIt has been justly noted that the merry singing and easy life of the\r\nswains in the _Bucolics_ are incongruous with the notorious condition\r\nof the rustic slaves of Italy. No doubt the contrast is painful. But we\r\nmust not presume to impute to the great and generous poet a light-headed\r\nand callous indifference to the miseries daily inflicted by capitalist\r\nexploiters of labour on their human chattels. We must not forget that in\r\nhill districts, where large-scale farming did not pay, rural life was\r\nstill going on in old-fashioned grooves. Nor must we forget that in his\r\nnative Cisalpine slavery was probably of a mild character. Some hundred\r\nyears later we hear[861] that chained gangs of slave-labourers were not\r\nemployed there: and the great armies recruited there in Caesar’s time do\r\nnot suggest that the free population had dwindled there as in Etruria or\r\nLucania. The song-loving shepherds are an importation from the Sicily of\r\nTheocritus, an extinct past, an artificial world kept alive in literature\r\nby the genius of its singer. In the hands of his great imitator the\r\nrustic figures become even more unreal. Hence the extreme difficulty of\r\nextracting any sure evidence on the status of these characters, or signs\r\nof the poet’s own sentiments, from the language of the _Bucolics_.\r\n\r\nIn the _Aeneid_ we have the legends of ancient Italy and the origin of\r\nRome subjected to epic treatment. The drift of the poem is conditioned\r\nby modern influence, the desire of Augustus to gain support for the new\r\nEmpire by fostering every germ of a national sentiment. The tale of Troy\r\nhas to be exploited for the purpose, and with the tale of Troy comes\r\nthe necessity of reproducing so far as possible the atmosphere of the\r\n‘heroic’ age. There is therefore hardly any reference to the matters\r\nwith which I am now concerned. When the poet speaks[862] of the peoples\r\nof ancient Italy it is in terms of general praise. Their warlike vigour\r\nand hardihood, the active life of hunters and farmers, can be admired\r\nwithout informing the reader whether they employed slave-labour or not.\r\nAnd in the rare references[863] to slavery in his own day Vergil has\r\nin mind the relation of master and slave simply, without any regard to\r\nagriculture. But in depicting the society of the ‘heroic’ times, in\r\nwhich the adventures of Aeneas are laid, a substratum of slavery was\r\nindispensable. It was therefore drawn from the Greek epic, where it lay\r\nready to hand. Yet the references to slaves are less numerous than we\r\nmight have expected. We find them employed in table-service (I 701-6),\r\nor as personal attendants (II 580, 712, IV 391, V 263, IX 329, XI 34).\r\nWe hear of a woman skilled in handicrafts (V 284) given as a prize, and\r\nCamilla is dedicated as a _famula_ of Diana (XI 558). These are not very\r\nsignificant references. But that slavery is assumed as an important\r\nelement in the social scheme may be inferred from the references to\r\ncaptives in war (II 786, III 323, IX 272-3). They are liable to be\r\noffered up as _inferiae_ to the dead (XI 81-2), and the victor takes the\r\nfemales as concubines at will (III 323-9, IX 546). A discarded concubine\r\nis handed over to a slave-consort (III 329), and the infant children of a\r\n_serva_ form part of a common unit with their dam (V 285).\r\n\r\nTwo passages are worth notice from an economic point of view. In VIII\r\n408-12, in a simile, we have the picture of a poor hard-working housewife\r\nwho rises very early to set her _famulae_ to work on their allotted\r\ntasks of wool, to ‘keep the little home together.’ One can hardly say\r\nthat no such scene was possible in real life under the conditions of\r\nVergil’s time, though we may fairly doubt the reality of a picture\r\nin which grim poverty and the desire to bring up a family of young\r\nchildren are combined with the ownership and employment of a staff of\r\ndomestic slaves. For we find the not owning a single slave[864] used as\r\nthe most characteristic sign of poverty. And I shrink from describing\r\nthe situation industrially as the sweating of slave-labour to maintain\r\nrespectability. I do not think any such notion was in the poet’s\r\nmind. That the simile is suggested by Greek models is pointed out by\r\nConington, and to regard it as a borrowed ornament is probably the safest\r\nconclusion in general. It is however to be noted that the _famulae_ are\r\nnot borrowed, but an addition of Vergil’s own. The other passage, XII\r\n517-20, relates the death in battle of an Arcadian, who in his home was\r\na fisherman, of humble station. The last point is brought out in the\r\nwords[865] _conductaque pater tellure serebat_. This seems to mean that\r\nhe was a small tenant farmer, a _colonus_ of the non-owning class. Such\r\na man might or might not have a slave or two. But, even were there any\r\nindication (which there is not) to favour either alternative, the man’s\r\nhome is in Arcadia, though the picture may be coloured by the poet’s\r\nfamiliarity with Italian details. Take it all in all, we are perhaps\r\njustified in saying that in the _Aeneid_ the realities of slavery and\r\nof humble labour generally are very lightly touched. Is this wholly due\r\nto the assumed proprieties of the heroic epic, dealing with characters\r\nabove the ordinary freeman in station or natural qualities? Or may we\r\nsurmise that to Vergil, with his intense human sympathies, the topic was\r\nin itself also distasteful, only to be referred to when it was hardly\r\npossible to avoid it?\r\n\r\nIf little, in fact almost nothing, can be gleaned bearing on the subject\r\nof labour from the _Bucolics_ and _Aeneid_, we might hope to find plenty\r\nof information in the didactic poem specially addressed to farmers. In\r\nthe opening of the _Georgics_ (I 41) Vergil plainly says that he feels\r\nsorry for the rustic folk, who know not the path to success in their\r\nvocation: he appeals to the gods interested in agriculture, and above\r\nall to Augustus, to look kindly on his bold endeavour to set farmers\r\nin the right way. When he comes to speak of the peace and plenty, the\r\nsecurity and joys, of country life, he grows enthusiastic (II 458-74).\r\nBut among the advantages he does not omit to reckon the freedom from the\r\nextravagance and garish display of city life, the freedom to drowse under\r\ntrees, the enjoyment of rural sights and sounds, in short the freedom to\r\ntake your ease with no lack of elbow-room (_latis otia fundis_). This\r\nhardly portrays the life of the working farmer, to whom throughout the\r\npoem he is ever preaching the gospel of toil and watchfulness. True,\r\nhe adds ‘there you find forest-lands (_saltus_) with coverts for wild\r\nbeasts, and a population inured to toil and used to scanty diet,’ among\r\nwhom yet linger survivals of the piety and righteousness of old. It is\r\nfair to ask, who are these and what place do they fill in the poet’s\r\npicture? Surely they are not the men who have fled from the vain follies\r\nof the city: for they are genuine rustics. Surely not gang-slaves,\r\ndriven out to labour in the fields and back again to be fed and locked\r\nup, like oxen or asses. To the urban slave transference to such a life\r\nwas a dreaded punishment. Are they free small-scale farmers? No doubt\r\nthere were still many of that class remaining in the upland parts of\r\nItaly. But were they men of leisure, able to take their ease at will\r\non broad estates? I cannot think of them in such a character, unless I\r\nassume them to own farms of comfortable size (of course not _latifundia_)\r\nand to employ some labour of slaves or hirelings. And there is nothing\r\nin the context to justify such an assumption. Lastly, are they poor\r\npeasants, holding small plots of land and eking out a meagre subsistence\r\nby occasional wage-earning labour? Such persons seem to have existed, at\r\nleast in certain parts of the country: but we know that some at least of\r\nthis labour hired for the job was performed[866] by bands of non-resident\r\nlabourers roaming in search of such employment. No, peasants of the\r\n‘crofter’ type do not fit in with this picture of a rural life passed in\r\nplenty and peaceful ease. I am therefore driven to conclude that the poet\r\nwas merely idealizing country life in general terms without troubling\r\nhimself to exercise a rigid consistency in the combination of details.\r\nHe has had many followers among poets and painters, naturally: but the\r\nclaim of the _Georgics_ to rank as a didactic treatise is exceptionally\r\nstrong, owing to the citations of Columella and Pliny. If then the poem\r\nseems in any respect to pass lightly over questions of importance in the\r\nconsideration of farming conditions, we are tempted rather to seek for a\r\nmotive than to impute neglect.\r\n\r\nBut before proceeding further it is well to inquire in what sense the\r\n_Georgics_ can be called didactic. What is the essential teaching of\r\nthe poem, and to whom is that teaching addressed? In outward form it\r\nprofesses to instruct the bewildered farmers, suffering at the time from\r\neffects of the recent civil wars as well as from economic difficulties of\r\nold standing; and to convey sound precepts for the conduct of agriculture\r\nin its various branches. But there is little doubt that the precepts are\r\nall or most of them taken directly from earlier[867] writers, Roman or\r\nGreek; and we may reasonably suppose that most of them (and those the\r\nmost practical ones) were well known to the very classes most concerned\r\nin their application. It is absurd to suppose that agricultural tradition\r\nhad utterly died out. The real difficulty was to put it in practice.\r\nNow, what class of farmers were to be benefited by the new poem? Was the\r\npeasant of the uplands, soaked in hereditary experience, to learn his\r\nbusiness over again with the help of the poet-laureate’s fascinating\r\nverse? Surely he spoke a rustic[868] Latin, and sometimes hardly that.\r\nWas it likely that he would gradually absorb the doctrines of the\r\nVergilian compendium, offered in the most refined language and metre of\r\nliterary Rome? It is surely inconceivable. Nor can we assume that any\r\nremaining intensive farmers of the Campanian plain were in much need\r\nof practical instruction: what was needed there was a respite from the\r\nunsettling disturbances of the revolutionary period. To suggest that a\r\npart of the poet’s design was to supply much-needed teaching to the new\r\n_coloni_ from the disbanded armies, would be grotesque in any case, and\r\nabove all in that of Vergil. If we are to find a class of men to whom\r\nthe finished literary art of the _Georgics_ would appeal, and who might\r\nprofit by the doctrines so attractively conveyed, we must seek them in\r\nsocial strata[869] possessed of education enough to appreciate the poem\r\nand sympathize with its general tone. Now all or most of such persons\r\nwould be well-to-do people, owners of property, often of landed property:\r\npeople of more or less leisure: in short, the cultured class, whose\r\ncentre was Rome. These people would view with favour any proposal for the\r\nbenefit of Italian agriculture. Many landowners at the time had got large\r\nestates cheaply in the time of troubles, and to them anything likely to\r\nimprove the value of their lands, and to draw a curtain of returning\r\nprosperity over a questionable past, would doubtless be welcome. They\r\nwould applaud the subtle grace with which the poet glorified the duty\r\nand profit of personal labour. But that they meant to work with their\r\nown hands I cannot believe. In the true spirit of their age, they would\r\nas a matter of course take the profit, and delegate the duty to others.\r\n\r\nTwo alternatives[870] presented themselves to a landowner. He might\r\nlet his estate whole or in parcels to a tenant or tenants. Or he might\r\nwork it for his own account, either under his own resident direction,\r\nor through the agency of a steward. All the evidence bearing on the\r\nrevolutionary period tends to shew that the resident landlord of a\r\nconsiderable estate, farming his own land, was a very rare type indeed.\r\nIt was found most convenient as a general rule to let an out-of-the-way\r\nfarm to a cultivating tenant at a money rent or on a sharing system. A\r\nmore accessible one was generally put under a steward and so kept in hand\r\nby the owner. The dwelling-house was in such cases improved so as to be a\r\nfit residence for the proprietor on his occasional visits. Growing luxury\r\noften carried this change to an extreme, and made the _villa_ a ‘place\r\nin the country,’ a scene of intermittent extravagance, not of steady\r\nincome-producing thrift. True, it seems that the crude and wasteful\r\nsystem of the earlier _latifundia_ had been a good deal modified by the\r\nend of the Republic. A wealthy man preferred to own several estates\r\nof moderate size situated near main routes of traffic. But this plan\r\nrequired more stewards. And the steward (_vilicus_), himself a slave,\r\nwas the head of a slave-staff proportioned to the size of the farm. Now\r\nthe public effectually reached by the _Georgics_ may be supposed to have\r\nincluded the landowners of education and leisure, whether they let their\r\nland to tenants or kept it in hand. I cannot believe that the _coloni_\r\nfarming hired land[871] came under the poet’s influence. In other\r\nwords, the _Georgics_, in so far as the poem made its way beyond purely\r\nliterary circles, appealed chiefly if not wholly to a class dependent on\r\nslave-labour in every department of their lives.\r\n\r\nMaecenas, to whom the poem is in form addressed, had put pressure on\r\nVergil to write it. At the back of Maecenas was the new Emperor, anxious\r\nto enlist all the talents in the service of the new dispensation. The\r\nrevival of rural Italy was one of the praiseworthy projects of the\r\nEmperor and his confidential minister. It was indeed on every ground\r\nmanifestly desirable. But was it possible now to turn Romans of property\r\ninto working farmers? Would the man-about-Rome leave urban pleasures\r\nfor the plough-tail? Not he! Nor are we to assume that Augustus was\r\nfool enough to expect it. Then what about Maecenas? His enjoyment of\r\nluxurious ease[872] was a byword: that he retained his native commonsense\r\nunder such conditions is one of his chief titles to fame. No one can have\r\nexpected him to wield the spade and mattock or spread manure. The poet\r\nwriting with such a man for patron and prompter was not likely to find\r\nhis precepts enjoining personal labour taken too seriously. His readers\r\nwere living in a social and moral atmosphere in which to do anything\r\ninvolving labour meant ordering a slave to do it. That the Emperor wished\r\nto see more people interested in the revival of Italian agriculture was\r\nwell understood. But this interest could be shown by investing capital in\r\nItalian land; and this is what many undoubtedly did. Recent proscriptions\r\nand confiscations had thrown numbers of estates on the market. It was\r\npossible to get a good bargain and at the same time win the favour of\r\nthe new ruler by a well-timed proof of confidence in the stability of\r\nthe new government. Now it is to say the least remarkable that Dion\r\nCassius, doubtless following earlier authorities, puts into the mouth of\r\nMaecenas some suggestions[873] on this very subject. After advising the\r\nEmperor to raise a standing army by enlisting the able-bodied unemployed\r\nmen in Italy, and pointing out that with the security thus gained, and\r\nthe provision of a harmless career for the sturdy wastrels who were at\r\npresent a cause of disorders, agriculture and commerce would revive, he\r\nproceeds as follows. For these measures money will be needed, as it would\r\nunder any government: therefore the necessity of some exactions must be\r\nfaced. ‘The very first thing[874] then for you to do is to have a sale of\r\nthe confiscated properties, of which there are many owing to the wars,\r\nreserving only a few that are specially useful or indispensable for your\r\npurposes: and then to employ all the money so raised by lending it out\r\nat moderate interest. If you do this, the land will be under cultivation\r\n(ἐνεργός), being placed in the hands of owners who themselves work\r\n(δεσπόταις αὐτουργοῖς δοθεῖσα): they will become more prosperous, having\r\nthe disposal of capital: and the treasury will have a sufficient and\r\nperpetual income.’ He then urges the necessity of preparing a complete\r\nbudget estimate of regular receipts from the above and other sources,\r\nand of the prospective regular charges both military and civil, with\r\nallowance for unforeseen contingencies. ‘And your next step should be to\r\nprovide for any deficit by imposing a tax on all properties whatsoever\r\nthat bring a profit (ἐπικαρπίαν τινὰ) to the owner, and by a system of\r\ntributary dues in all our subject provinces.’\r\n\r\nThat this long oration attributed by Dion to Maecenas is in great part\r\nmade up from details of the policy actually followed by the Emperor,\r\nis I believe generally admitted. But I am not aware that the universal\r\nincome-tax suggested was imposed. The policy of encouraging agriculture\r\ncertainly formed part of the imperial scheme, and the function of the\r\n_Georgics_ was to bring the power of literature to bear in support of the\r\nmovement. The poet could hardly help referring in some way to the crying\r\nneed of a great agricultural revival. He did it with consummate skill. He\r\ndid not begin by enlarging on the calamities of the recent past, and then\r\nproceed to offer his remedies. Such a method would at once have aroused\r\nsuspicion and ill-feeling. No, he waited till he was able to glide easily\r\ninto a noble passage in which he speaks of the civil wars as a sort of\r\ndoom sanctioned by the heavenly powers. No party could take offence at\r\nthis way of putting it. Then he cries aloud to the Roman gods, not to\r\nprevent the man of the hour (_hunc iuvenem_) from coming to the relief\r\nof a ruined generation. The needs of the moment are such that we cannot\r\ndo without him. The world is full of wickedness and wars: ‘the plough is\r\nnot respected as it should be; the tillers of the soil have been drafted\r\naway, and the land is gone to weeds; the crooked sickles are being forged\r\ninto straight swords.’ The passage comes at the end of the first book,\r\nfollowing a series of precepts delivered coolly and calmly as though\r\nin a social atmosphere of perfect peace. The tone in which the words\r\nrecall the reader to present realities, and subtly hint at the obvious\r\nduty of supporting the one possible restorer of Roman greatness, is an\r\nunsurpassed feat of literary art. It is followed up at the end of the\r\nsecond book in another famous passage, in which he preaches with equal\r\ndelicacy the doctrine that agricultural revival is the one sure road not\r\nonly to personal happiness but to the true greatness of the Roman people.\r\n\r\nThat this revival was bound up with the return to a system of farming\r\non a smaller scale, implying more direct personal attention on the\r\nlandlord’s part, is obvious. But the poet goes further. His model farmer\r\nis to be convinced of the necessity and benefit of personal labour, and\r\nso to put his own hand to the plough. The glorification of unyielding\r\ntoil[875] as the true secret of success was (and is) a congenial topic to\r\npreachers of the gospel of ‘back to the land.’ It may well be that the\r\nthoughtful Vergil had misgivings as to the fruitfulness of his doctrine.\r\nA cynical critic might hint that it was easy enough for one man to urge\r\nothers to work. But a man like Maecenas would smile at such remarks. To\r\nset other people to do what he would never dream of doing himself was to\r\nhim the most natural thing in the world. So the pressure of the patron\r\non the poet continued, and the _Georgics_ were born.\r\n\r\nLet me now turn to certain passages of the poem in which farm-labour\r\nis directly referred to, and see how far the status of the labourers\r\ncan be judged from the expressions used and the context. And first of\r\n_aratores_. In I 494 and II 513 the _agricola_ is a plowman; free,\r\nfor all that appears to the contrary. In II 207, where he appears as\r\nclearing off wood[876] and ploughing up the land, the _arator_ is called\r\n_iratus_: this can hardly apply to an indifferent slave. The _arator_\r\nof I 261, represented as turning the leisure enforced by bad weather to\r\nuseful indoor work, odd jobs in iron and wood work etc, may be one of a\r\nslave-staff whom his master will not have idle. Or he may be the farmer\r\nhimself. The scene implies the presence of a staff of some kind, driven\r\nindoors by the rain. And that the poet is not thinking of a solitary\r\npeasant is further indicated by mention of sheep-washing, certainly\r\nnot a ‘one-man-job,’ in line 272. Why Conington (after Heyne) takes\r\n_agitator aselli_ in 273 to be ‘the peasant who happens to drive the ass\r\nto market,’ and not an _asinarius_ doing his regular duty, I cannot say.\r\nOn III 402, a very similar passage, he takes the _pastor_ to be probably\r\nthe farm-slave, not the owner, adding ‘though it is not always easy to\r\nsee for what class of men Virgil is writing.’ A remark which shews that\r\nmy present inquiry is not uncalled for. To return, there is nothing to\r\nshew whether the ass-driver is a freeman or a slave. Nor is the status\r\nof _messores_[877] clear. In I 316-7 the farmer brings the mower on to\r\nthe yellow fields; that is, he orders his hands to put in the sickle.\r\nWhat is their relation to him we do not hear. So too in II 410 _postremus\r\nmetito_ is a precept addressed to the farmer as farmer, not as potential\r\nlabourer. On the other hand the _messores_ in the second and third\r\neclogues seem to be slaves, for there is reference to _domini_ in both\r\npoems.\r\n\r\nThe _fossor_ is in literature the personification of mere heavy manual\r\nlabour. In default of evidence to the contrary, we must suppose him to\r\nbe normally[878] a slave. Thus the _fossor_ of Horace _odes_ III 18 is\r\nprobably one of the _famuli operum soluti_ of the preceding ode. But the\r\nbrawny digger of _Georgics_ II 264, who aids nature’s work by stirring\r\nand loosening the caked earth, is left on a neutral footing. Nothing is\r\nsaid. The reader must judge whether this silence is the result of pure\r\ninadvertency. That _pastores_ very often means slave-herdsmen, is well\r\nknown. But Vergil seems to attribute to them a more real and intelligent\r\ninterest in the welfare of their charge than it is reasonable to expect\r\nfrom rustic slaves. The _pastores_ of IV 278, who gather the medicinal\r\nherb used in the treatment of bees, may be slaves: if so, they are not\r\nmere thoughtless animals. And the scene is in the Cisalpine, where\r\nwe have noted that slavery was probably of a mild type. In III 420\r\nthe _pastor_ is called upon to protect his beasts from snakes. But we\r\nknow[879] that it was a part of slave-herdsmen’s duty to fight beasts of\r\nprey, and that they were commonly armed for that purpose. In III 455 we\r\nfind him shrinking from a little act of veterinary surgery, which the\r\ncontext suggests he ought to perform. But we know that the _magister\r\npecoris_ on a farm was instructed[880] in simple veterinary practice, and\r\nit is hardly likely that other slaves, specially put in charge of beasts,\r\nhad no instructions. The _pastores_ (if more than one, the chief,) appear\r\nas _pecorum magistri_ (II 529, III 445, cf _Buc_ III 101), a regular name\r\nfor shepherds: they are not the same as the _magistri_ of III 549, who\r\nare veterinary specialists disguised under mythical names. In II 529-31\r\nwe have a holiday scene, in which the farmer (_ipse_) treats the _pecoris\r\nmagistri_ to a match of wrestling and throwing the javelin. If slaves\r\nare meant, then Vergil is surely carrying back rustic slavery to early\r\ndays as part and parcel of the ‘good old times’ to which he points in the\r\nfollowing lines _hanc olim veteres vitam coluere Sabini_ etc. The _ipse_\r\nwill then be a genial farmer of the old school, whose slaves are very\r\ndifferent from the degraded and sullen chattels of more recent years. But\r\nin this as in other cases the poet gives us no clear sign.\r\n\r\nA passage[881] in which the reticence of which I am speaking has a\r\npeculiar effect occurs in the description of the grievous murrain that\r\nvisited northern Italy some time before. One of a pair of oxen falls dead\r\nwhile drawing the plough. The _tristis arator_[882] unyokes the other,\r\nsorrow-stricken at the death of its fellow; he leaves the plough where\r\nit stopped, and goes his way. Then follows a piece of highly-wrought\r\npathos[883] describing the dejection and collapse of the surviving ox.\r\n‘What now avail him his toil or his services, his past work in turning\r\nup the heavy land with the ploughshare?’ And the hardness of the poor\r\nbeast’s lot is emphasized by the reflexion that disease in cattle is\r\nnot induced by gluttony and wine-bibbing, as it often is in the case of\r\nmankind, nor by the worries (_cura_) that rob men of refreshing sleep.\r\nThis much-admired passage may remind us of the high value set upon the ox\r\nin ancient Italy, traditionally amounting to a kind of sanctity; for it\r\nis said[884] that to kill an ox was as great a crime as to kill a man.\r\nWe may wonder too what the luxurious but responsible Maecenas thought\r\nof the lines contrasting the simple diet and untroubled life of the ox\r\nwith the excesses and anxieties of man. But, if civilization owed much\r\nto the labours of the ox, and if gratitude was due to man’s patient\r\nhelper, what about the human slave? Is it not a remarkable thing that the\r\n_Georgics_ contain not a word of appreciative reference to the myriads of\r\ntoiling bondsmen whose sweat and sufferings had been exploited by Roman\r\nlandlords for at least 150 years? Can this silence on the part of a poet\r\nwho credits an ox with human affection be regarded as a merely accidental\r\nomission?\r\n\r\nOf poets in general it may I think be truly said that the relation\r\nbetween the singer and his vocabulary varies greatly in various cases.\r\nPersonal judgments are very fallible: but to me, the more I read Vergil,\r\nthe more I see in him an extreme case of the poet ever nervously on\r\nhis guard[885] against expressing or suggesting any meaning or shade\r\nof meaning beyond that which at a given moment he wishes to convey.\r\nThis is no original discovery. But in reaching it independently I have\r\nbecome further convinced that the limitations of his vocabulary are\r\nevidence of nice and deliberate selection. The number of well-established\r\nLatin words, adaptable to verse and to the expression of ideas certain\r\nto occur, that are used by other poets of note but not by him, is\r\nconsiderable. I have a long list: here I will mention only one, the\r\nadjective _vagus_. The word may have carried to him associations below\r\nthe pure dignity of his finished style. Yet Horace used it freely in the\r\n_Odes_, and Horace was surely no hasty hack careless of propriety, and\r\nno mean judge of what was proper. Now, when I turn to the _Georgics_,\r\nVergil’s most finished work, I am struck by the absence of certain words\r\nthe presence of which would seem natural, or even to be expected, in any\r\nwork professedly treating of agriculture in Roman Italy. Thus _servus_\r\ndoes not occur at all, _serva_ in the _Aeneid_ only, and _servitium_ in\r\nthe strict sense only _Buc_ I 40 and _Aen_ III 327. In _Georg_ III 167-8\r\n_ubi libera colla servitio adsuerint_ he is speaking of the breaking-in\r\nof young oxen[886] in figurative language. So too _dominus_ and _domina_\r\noccur in the _Bucolics_ and _Aeneid_ but not in the _Georgics_. The case\r\nof _opera_ and the plural _operae_ may seem to be on a somewhat different\r\nfooting in so far as the special sense of _opera_ = ‘the average day’s\r\nwork[887] of a labourer’ would perhaps have too technical and prosaic a\r\nflavour. In the single instance (_Aen_ VII 331-2), where it occurs in the\r\nfamiliar phrase _da operam_, it is coupled with _laborem_, which rather\r\nsuggests a certain timidity in the use of a colloquial expression. The\r\nplural, frequent in the writers on agriculture, he does not use at all,\r\nwhether because he avoids the statistical estimates in which it most\r\nnaturally comes, or from sheer fastidiousness due to the disreputable\r\nassociations of _operae_ in political slang. Perhaps neither of these\r\nreasons is quite enough to account for the absence of the word from the\r\n_Georgics_. That _famulus_ and _famula_ occur in the _Aeneid_ only is\r\nnot surprising, for they represent the δμῶες and δμωαὶ of Greek heroic\r\npoetry. But _famula_ appears in the _Moretum_, of which I will speak\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nThat Vergil is all the while pointing the way to a system of small farms\r\nand working farmers, though some topics (for instance stock-keeping)\r\nseem to touch on a larger scale of business, may be gathered from his\r\nreferences to _coloni_. The word is in general used merely as the\r\nsubstantive corresponding to _colere_, and its place is often taken by\r\n_agricola_ (I 300, II 459) or _rusticus_ (II 406) or other substitutes.\r\nIn II 433 _homines_ means much the same as the _agrestis_ of I 41, only\r\nthat the former need stimulus and the latter guidance. The typical\r\npicture of the _colonus_ comes in I 291-302, where the small farmer\r\nand his industrious wife are seen taking some relaxation in the winter\r\nseason, but never idle. It is surely a somewhat idealized picture. The\r\nparallel in Horace (_epode_ II) is more matter-of-fact, and clearly\r\nincludes slaves, an element ignored by Vergil. The _colonus_ is not\r\na mere tenant farmer, but a yeoman tilling his own land, like the\r\n_veteres coloni_ of the ninth eclogue, a freeman, and we may add liable\r\nto military service, like those in I 507 whose conscription left the\r\nfarms derelict. A curious and evidently exceptional case is that of\r\nthe _Corycius senex_ (IV 125-46), said to be one of Pompey’s pirate\r\ncolonists. The man is a squatter on a patch of unoccupied land, which he\r\nhas cultivated as a garden, raising by unwearied industry quite wonderful\r\ncrops of vegetables fruit and flowers, and remarkably successful[888] as\r\na bee-keeper. Perhaps this transplanted Oriental had no slave, at least\r\nwhen he started gardening. But I note that his croft was more than a\r\n_iugerum_ (_pauca relicti iugera ruris_) at the time when Vergil saw it,\r\nand I imagine the process of reclaiming the waste to have been gradual.\r\nWhen this small holding was complete and in full bearing, would the work\r\nof one elderly man suffice to carry it on? I wonder. But we get no hint\r\nof a slave or a hireling, or even of a wife. All I can venture to say\r\nis that this story is meant to be significant of the moral and material\r\nwellbeing of the small cultivator. It is curious that just above (118,\r\ncf 147-8) the poet is at pains to excuse his omission to discuss in\r\ndetail the proper management of _horti_, on the pretext of want of space.\r\nFor he was no mean antiquary, and Pliny tells[889] us that in the Twelve\r\nTables _hortus_ was used of what was afterwards called _villa_, a country\r\nfarm, while _heredium_ stood for a garden; and adds that in old time\r\n_per se hortus ager pauperis erat_. But _hortus_ is to Vergil strictly a\r\ngarden, and the old Corycian is cited expressly as a gardener: his land,\r\nwe are told, was not suited for growing corn or vines.\r\n\r\nThe mention of gardening invites me to say a few words on the short\r\ndescriptive idyll _Moretum_ which has been regarded as a youthful\r\ncomposition of Vergil (perhaps from a Greek original) with more justice\r\nthan some other pieces attributed to him. I see no strong objection to\r\nadmitting it as Vergilian, but it is of course crude and far removed from\r\nthe manner and finish of the mature _Georgics_. The peasant Simylus,\r\n_exigui cultor rusticus agri_, is a poor small farmer whose thrift and\r\nindustry enable him to make a living ‘in a humble and pottering way,’\r\nas Gilbert puts it. His holding is partly ordinary arable land, but\r\nincludes a _hortus_ as well. In the latter he skilfully grows a variety\r\nof vegetables, for which he finds a regular market in the city. Poor\r\nthough he is, and accustomed to wait on himself, apparently unmarried,\r\nhe yet owns a slave (_famulam_, 93) and she is a negro, fully described\r\n(31-5), woolly hair, thick lips, dark skin, spindle shanks, paddle feet,\r\netc. She probably would do the house-work, but the preparation of food is\r\na duty in which her master also bears a part. We hear of no male slave,\r\nand the ploughing of fields and digging the garden are apparently done by\r\nhimself singlehanded. The yoke of oxen are mentioned in the last lines.\r\nThe picture is such as may have been true of some humble homesteads in\r\nItaly, but the tradition of a Greek original, and the names Simylus and\r\nScybale, must leave us in some doubt as to whether the scene be really\r\nItalian. The position is in fact much the same as it is in regard to the\r\n_Bucolics_.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the correct view as to the authorship and bearing of\r\nthe _Moretum_, there are I think certain conclusions to be drawn from\r\nan examination of the _Georgics_, which it is time to summarize. First,\r\nthe tendency of the poem is to advocate a system of smaller holdings and\r\nmore intensive cultivation than had for a long period been customary in\r\na large part of Italy. This reform is rather suggested by implication\r\nthan directly urged, though one precept, said to be borrowed[890] from\r\nold Cato, recommends it in plain words. For the glorification of labour\r\nin general is all the while pointing in this direction. Secondly, the\r\npolicy of the new Emperor, who posed as Restorer and Preserver rather\r\nthan Reformer, finds a sympathetic or obedient expression in this\r\ntendency. For it is delicately conveyed that the reform of an evil\r\nagricultural present virtually consists in the return to the ways of a\r\nbetter past. And the poet, acting as poet simply, throws on this better\r\npast the halo of a golden age still more remote. The virtues of the\r\nSabines of old[891] are an example of the happiness and honour attainable\r\nby a rustic folk. But to Vergil, steeped in ancient legend, the historic\r\nworthies of a former age are not the beginning of things. They come\r\n‘trailing clouds of glory’ from the mythical origin[892] of mankind, from\r\na world of primeval abundance and brotherly communism, a world which\r\nhe like Lucretius pauses to portray. Thirdly, the reaction of Augustus\r\nagainst the bold cosmopolitanism of Julius Caesar has I think left a\r\nmark on the _Georgics_ in the fact that the poem is, as Sellar says, so\r\nthoroughly representative of Italy. Roman Italy was not yet ready to\r\nbecome merely a part of an imperial estate. If people were to acquiesce\r\nin a monarchy, it had to be disguised, and one important disguise was\r\nthe make-believe that the Roman people were lords of the world. A very\r\nharmless method of ministering to Roman self-complacency was excessive\r\npraise of Italy, its soil, its climate, its natural features, its\r\nvarious products, its races of men and their works, and all the historic\r\nassociations of the victorious past. It is a notable fact that this\r\npanegyric[893] breaks out in the utterances of four very dissimilar\r\nworks that still survive: for beside the _Georgics_ I must place[894]\r\nthe so-called _Roman Antiquities_ of Dionysius, the _Geography_ of\r\nStrabo, and the _de re rustica_ of Varro. These four are practically\r\ncontemporaries. It seems to me hardly credible that there was not some\r\ncommon influence operative at the time and encouraging utterances of this\r\ntone.\r\n\r\nThe actual success or failure of the attempt to revive Roman agriculture\r\non a better footing is not only a question of fact in itself historically\r\nimportant: its determination will throw light on the circumstances in\r\nwhich Vergil wrote, and perhaps help somewhat in suggesting reasons\r\nfor his avoidance of certain topics. If we are to believe Horace[895],\r\nthe agricultural policy of Augustus was a grand success: security,\r\nprosperity, virtue, good order, had become normal: fertility had returned\r\nto the countryside. I had better say at once that I put little faith in\r\nthese utterances of a court poet. Far more significant is the statement,\r\npreserved by Suetonius[896], of the evils dealt with by Augustus in\r\ncountry districts. Parties of armed bandits infested the country.\r\nTravellers, slaves and freemen alike, were kidnapped and _ergastulis\r\npossessorum supprimebantur_. He checked the brigandage by armed police\r\nposted at suitable spots, and _ergastula recognovit_. But it is not said\r\nthat he did away with them: he cleared out of them the persons illegally\r\nheld in bondage (_suppressi_). Not only is rustic slavery in full swing\r\nin the treatise of Varro: some 80 years later the _ergastulum_ is\r\nadopted as a matter of course by Columella, and appears as a canker of\r\nagriculture in the complaints of Pliny. The neglect of rustic industry\r\nis lamented by all three writers, and to the testimony of such witnesses\r\nit is quite needless to add quotations from writers of merely literary\r\nmerit. There is no serious doubt that the reconstruction of agriculture\r\non the basis of small farms tilled by working farmers was at best\r\nsuccessful in a very moderate degree; and this for many a long year.\r\nOrganized slave-labour remained the staple appliance of tillage until the\r\ngrowing scarcity of slaves and the financial policy of the later Empire\r\nbrought about the momentous change by which the free farmer gradually\r\nbecame the predial serf.\r\n\r\nAnother point to be noted in the _Georgics_ is the absence of any\r\nreference to _coloni_ as tenants under a landlord. Yet we know that\r\nthis relation existed in Cicero’s time, and tenant farmers appear in\r\nVarro[897] and Columella[898]. Vergil, but for a stray reference in the\r\n_Aeneid_, might seem never to have heard of the existence of such people.\r\nIt is easy to say that the difference between an owner and a tenant is\r\na difference in law, and unsuited for discussion in a poem. But it also\r\ninvolves economic problems. The landlord wants a good return on his\r\ncapital, the tenant wants to make a good living, and the conditions of\r\ntenancy vary greatly in various cases. The younger Pliny[899] had to\r\ndeal with awkward questions between him and his tenants, and there is\r\nno reason to suppose that his case was exceptional. Surely the subject\r\nwas one of immediate interest to an agricultural reformer, quite as\r\ninteresting as a number of the details set forth here and there in the\r\n_Georgics_; that is, assuming that the author meant his farmer to be\r\neconomically prosperous as well as to set a good example. It may be\r\nargued that the operations enjoined on the farmer would greatly improve\r\nthe farm and enhance the value of the land, and that no man in his senses\r\nwould do this unless the land were his own: there was therefore no need\r\nto discuss tenancy, ownership being manifestly implied. The argument is\r\nfair, so far as it goes. But it does not justify complete silence on what\r\nwas probably at the moment a question of no small importance in the eyes\r\nof landowners.\r\n\r\nSome passages of Horace may serve to shew that circumstances might\r\nhave justified or even invited some reference to this topic. In the\r\nseventh _epistle_ of the first book he tells the story of how Philippus\r\nplayed a rather scurvy trick on a freedman in a small way of business\r\nas an auctioneer. As a social superior, his patronage turned the poor\r\nman’s head. Taking him for an outing to his own Sabine country place,\r\nhe infected him with desire of a rustic life. He amused himself by\r\npersuading him to buy a small farm, offering him about £60 as a gift and\r\na loan of as much more. The conversion of a regular town-bred man into\r\na thoroughgoing farmer was of course a pitiful failure. Devotion and\r\nindustry availed him nothing. The losses and disappointments incidental\r\nto farming were too much for him. He seems to have had no slave: he\r\nprobably had not sufficient capital. He ended by piteously entreating\r\nhis patron to put him back into his own trade. The story is placed about\r\ntwo generations before Horace wrote. But it would be pointless if it\r\nwere out of date in its setting, which it surely is not; it might have\r\nhappened to a contemporary, nay to Horace himself. It is addressed to his\r\nown patron Maecenas, the generous donor of his own Sabine estate. Here\r\nwe have a clear intimation that to buy a little plot and try to get a\r\nliving out of it by your own labour was an enterprise in which success\r\nwas no easy matter. In the second _satire_ of the second book we have\r\nthe case of Ofellus, one of the yeomen of the old school. He had been a\r\nworking farmer on his own land, but in the times of trouble his farm had\r\nbeen confiscated and made over to a discharged soldier. But this veteran\r\nwisely left him in occupation as cultivator on terms. Whether he became\r\na sort of farm-bailiff, working for the new owner’s account at a fixed\r\nsalary, or whether he became a tenant, farming on his own account and\r\npaying a rent, has been doubted. I am strongly of the second opinion.\r\nFor it was certainly to the owner’s interest that the land should be\r\nwell-farmed, and that his own income (the endowment of his later years)\r\nshould be well-secured by giving the farmer every motive for industry.\r\nThese considerations do not suit well with the former alternative, which\r\nalso makes _colonus_ hardly distinguishable from _vilicus_. Again, the\r\n_colonus_ is on the farm[900] _cum pecore et gnatis_. The _pecus_, like\r\nthe children, is surely the farmer’s own, and it is much more likely that\r\nthe live-stock should belong to a rent-paying tenant than to a salaried\r\nbailiff. Moreover, there is no mention of slaves. The man works the farm\r\nwith the help of his family. Is it likely that he would turn them into a\r\nhousehold of serfs? Therefore I render line 115 _fortem mercede colonum_\r\n‘a sturdy tenant-farmer sitting at a rent’; that is, on a holding that\r\nas owner he formerly occupied rent-free. He can make the farm pay even\r\nnow: as for the mere fact of ground-landlordship, that is an idle boast,\r\nand in any case limited by the span of human life. I claim that these\r\ntwo passages are enough to prove the point for which I am contending;\r\nnamely, that questions of the tenure under which agriculture could best\r\nbe carried on were matters of some interest and importance about the time\r\nwhen Vergil was writing the _Georgics_.\r\n\r\nBut the help of Horace is by no means exhausted. He refers to a story\r\nof a wage-earning labourer (_mercennarius_) who had the luck to turn\r\nup a buried treasure, a find which enabled him to buy the very farm on\r\nwhich he was employed, and work it as his own. There is no point in\r\nthis ‘yarn’ unless it was a well-known tale, part of the current stock\r\nof the day. The famous _satire_ in which it occurs (II 6) seems to be\r\nalmost exactly contemporary with the appearance of the _Georgics_. In it\r\nthe restful charm of country life is heartily preferred to the worries\r\nand boredom of Rome. His Sabine estate, with its garden, its unfailing\r\nspring of water, and a strip of woodland, is of no great size, but it\r\nis enough: he is no greedy land-grabber. When in Rome he longs for it.\r\nThere he can take his ease among spoilt young slaves, born[901] on the\r\nplace, keeping a sort of Liberty Hall for his friends. The talk at table\r\nis not _de villis domibusve alienis_ but of a more rational and improving\r\nkind: envy of other men’s wealth is talked out with an apposite fable.\r\nHere we have mention of wage-earning, land-purchase, and slaves. And\r\nthe poet’s estate is evidently in the first place a residence, not a\r\nfarm worked on strict economic lines. That the number of slave hands\r\n(_operae_) employed there on the Home Farm[902] was eight, we learn\r\nfrom another _satire_ (II 7 118). To the smart country seats, which\r\nadvertise the solid wealth of rich capitalists, he refers in express\r\nterms in _epistles_ I 15 45-6, and by many less particular references.\r\nThe land-grabbers are often mentioned, and the forest-lands (_saltus_)\r\nused for grazing, in which much money was invested by men ‘land-proud,’\r\nas a sign of their importance. In short, the picture of rural Italy given\r\nby Horace reveals to us a state of things wholly unfavourable to the\r\nreception of the message of the _Georgics_. When he speaks of _pauper\r\nruris colonus_ or of _inopes coloni_ he is surely not betraying envy of\r\nthese toilers’ lot. Far from it. When enjoying a change in his country\r\nplace, he may occasionally divert himself with a short spell[903] of\r\nfield-work, at which his neighbours grin. On the other hand the spectacle\r\nof a disreputable freedman, enriched by speculations in time of public\r\ncalamity, and enabled through ill-gotten wealth to become a great\r\nlandlord, is the cause of wrathful indignation (_epode_ IV). And these\r\nand other candid utterances come from one whose father was a freedman\r\nin a country town, farming in quite a small way, to whose care and\r\nself-denial the son owed the education that equipped him for rising in\r\nthe world. Horace indeed is one of the best of witnesses on these points.\r\n\r\nThere are points on which Vergil and Horace are agreed, though generally\r\nwith a certain difference of attitude. Thus, both prefer the country to\r\nthe town, but Horace frankly because he enjoys it and likes a rest: he\r\ndoes not idealize country life as such, still less agricultural labour.\r\nBoth disapprove _latifundia_, but Horace on simple commonsense grounds,\r\nnot as a reformer. Both praise good old times, but Horace without the\r\nfaintest suggestion of possible revival of them, or anything like them.\r\nBoth refer to the beginnings of civilization, but Vergil looks back to\r\na golden age of primitive communism, when _in medium quaerebant_ and\r\nso forth; a state of things ended by Jove’s ordinance that man should\r\nraise himself by toil. Horace, less convinced of the superiority of\r\nthe past, depicts[904] the noble savage as having to fight for every\r\nthing, even acorns; and traces steps, leading eventually to law and\r\norder, by which he became less savage and more noble. Horace is nearer\r\nto Lucretius here than Vergil is. Neither could ignore the disturbing\r\neffect of the disbanding of armies and ejectment of farmers to make\r\nway for the settlement of rude soldiers on the land. But to Horace,\r\npersonally unconcerned, a cool view was more possible. So, while hinting\r\nat public uneasiness[905] as to the detailed intentions of the new ruler\r\nin this matter, he is able to look at the policy in general merely as\r\nthe restoration of weary veterans to a life of peace and the relief of\r\ntheir chief’s anxieties. Vergil, himself a sufferer, had his little fling\r\nin the _Bucolics_, and was silent[906] in the _Georgics_. Again, Vergil\r\nshuns the function of war as a means of supplying the slave-market. He\r\nknows it well enough, and as a feature of the ‘heroic’ ages the fate of\r\nthe captive appears in the _Aeneid_. Horace makes no scruple[907] of\r\nstating the time-honoured principle that a captive is to the conqueror\r\na valuable asset: there is a market for him as a serviceable drudge,\r\nand not to spare his life is sheer waste. That there may be sarcasm\r\nunderlying the passage does not impair its candour. And it distinctly\r\nincludes rustic slavery in the words _sine pascat durus aretque_.\r\nLastly, while both poets praise the restfulness of the countryside with\r\nequal sincerity, it is Horace who recognizes[908] that the working\r\nfarmer himself, after his long labours at the plough, looks forward to\r\nretirement and ease when he has saved enough to live on. His is a real\r\nrustic, Vergil’s an ideal.\r\n\r\nIt will be admitted that all writers are, as sources of evidence, at\r\ntheir best when they feel free to say or to leave unsaid this or that\r\naccording to their own judgment. If there is in the background some\r\nother person whom it is necessary to please, it is very hard to divine\r\nthe reason of an author’s frankness, and still more of his reticence.\r\nFor instance, the omission of a topic naturally connected with a subject\r\nneed not imply that a patron forbade its introduction. I cannot believe\r\nthat such a man as Maecenas[909] banned the free mention of slavery in\r\nthe _Georgics_. But, if a whole subject is proposed for treatment under\r\nconditions of a well-understood tendency, the writer is not unlikely to\r\ndiscover that artistic loyalty to that tendency will operate to render\r\nthe introduction of this or that particular topic a matter of extreme\r\ndifficulty. If the task of Vergil was to recommend a return to a more\r\nwholesome system of agriculture, reference to the labour-question or\r\nto land-tenure bristled with difficulties. My belief is that the poet\r\nshirked these topics, relevant though they surely were, because he did\r\nnot see how to treat them without provoking controversy or ill-feeling;\r\na result which Maecenas and the Emperor were undoubtedly anxious to\r\navoid. It was simpler and safer not to refer to these things. True, the\r\nomission was a restraint on full-blooded realism. An indistinct picture\r\nwas produced, and modern critics have some reason to complain of the\r\ndifficulty of understanding many places of the _Georgics_.\r\n\r\nWhether chronological considerations may throw any light on the\r\ninfluences to which this indistinctness is due, and, if so, what is their\r\nexact significance, are very difficult questions, to which I cannot\r\noffer a definite answer. The completion of the _Georgics_ is placed in\r\nthe year 30 BC, after seven years more or less spent on composition and\r\nrevision. Now it was in that year that the new ruler, supreme since the\r\noverthrow of Antony, organized the great disbandment of armies of which\r\nhe speaks in the famous inscription[910] recording the events of his\r\ncareer. He tells us that he rewarded all the discharged men, either with\r\nassignations of land or with sums of money in lieu thereof. The lands\r\nwere bought by him (not confiscated) and the money-payments also were at\r\nhis cost (_a me dedi_). Below he refers to the matter again, and adds\r\nthat to pay for lands taken and assigned to soldiers was a thing no one\r\nhad ever done before. That he paid in all cases, and paid the full market\r\nvalue, he does not expressly say; Mommsen shews cause for doubting it.\r\nThe only remark I have to make is that in the years between Philippi\r\nand Aetium there was plenty of fighting and negotiations. Maecenas was\r\nfor most of the time in a position of great trust, and pretty certainly\r\nin touch with all that went on. The fact that a wholesale discharge\r\nof soldiers was surely coming, and that the future of agriculture in\r\nItaly was doubtful, was perhaps not likely to escape the forecast of so\r\nfar-sighted a man. Is it just possible that Vergil may have had a hint\r\nfrom him, to stick to generalities and avoid controversial topics? We are\r\ncredibly informed[911] that Maecenas was well rewarded by his master for\r\nhis valuable services, and it has been pointed out[912] that his position\r\nof authority offered many opportunities of profitable transactions\r\non his own account. There is even an express tradition that he was\r\nconcerned in the liquidation of one estate. In short, he was one of the\r\nland-speculators of the time. To such a man it would seem not untimely\r\nto praise the virtues of the rustic Romans of old and to recommend their\r\nrevival in the coming age; but to call attention to the uncertainties of\r\nthe present, involving many awkward problems, would seem imprudent. In\r\nsuggesting, doubtfully, that a patron’s restraining hand may have had\r\nsomething to do with the poet’s reticence, I may be exaggerating the\r\npressure exercised by the one on the other. But that Maecenas interested\r\nhimself in the slowly-growing poem is hardly to be doubted. Early in each\r\nof the four books he is addressed by name. His _haud mollia iussa_ (III\r\n41) may imply nothing more than the general difficulty of Vergil’s task:\r\nbut may it not faintly indicate just the least little restiveness under a\r\nguidance that could not be refused openly?\r\n\r\nTo reject the suggestion of actual interference on Maecenas’ part is not\r\nto say that the _Georgics_ exhibits no deference to his wishes. That many\r\na veiled hint could be given by a patron in conversation is obvious.\r\nThat Maecenas would be a master of that judicious art, is probable\r\nfrom what we know of his character and career. But, while it is plain\r\nthat questions of land-tenure would from his point of view be better\r\nignored, how would his likes and dislikes affect the mention of slavery\r\nand the labour-question? Here I must refer to the three great writers\r\non agriculture. Cato, about 150 years earlier, and Columella, about 80\r\nyears later, both contemplate the actual buying of land, and insist on\r\nthe care necessary in selection. The contemporary Varro seems certainly\r\nto assume purchase. All three deal with slave-labour, Cato like a\r\nhard-fisted _dominus_ of an old-Roman generation just become consciously\r\nimperial and bent on gain, Columella as a skilful organizer of the only\r\nregular supply of labour practically available: Varro, who makes more\r\nallowance[913] for free labour beside that of slaves, reserves the free\r\nman for important jobs, where he may be trusted to use his wits, or for\r\nunhealthy work, in which to risk slaves is to risk your own property.\r\nAll the ordinary work in his system is done by slaves. The contemporary\r\nLivy[914] tells us that in his time large districts near Rome had scarce\r\nany free inhabitants left. The elder Pliny, reckoning up the advantages\r\nof Italy for the practice of agriculture, includes[915] among them the\r\nsupply of _servitia_, though no man knew better than he what fatal\r\nresults had issued from the plantation-system. It is to be borne in mind\r\nthat this evidence relates to the plains and the lower slopes of hills,\r\nthat is to the main agricultural districts. It is to these parts that\r\nGardthausen[916] rightly confines his remarks on the desolation of Italy,\r\nwhich began before the civil wars and was accelerated by them. Other\r\nlabour was scarce, and gangs of slaves, generally chained, were almost\r\nthe only practicable means of tillage for profit. Speaking broadly, I\r\nthink the truth of this picture is not to be denied. If then the word had\r\ngone forth that a return to smaller-scale farming was to be advocated\r\nas a cure for present evils, it was hardly possible to touch on slavery\r\nwithout some unfavourable reference to the plantation-system. Now surely\r\nit is most unlikely that Maecenas, a cool observer and a thorough child\r\nof the age, sincerely believed in the possibility of setting back the\r\nclock. The economic problem could not be solved so simply, by creating\r\na wave of ‘back-to-the-land’ enthusiasm. I suggest that he saw no good\r\nto be got by openly endeavouring to recreate the race of small working\r\nfarmers by artificial means. Would it be wise to renew an attempt in\r\nwhich the Gracchi had failed? Now to Vergil, who had passed his youth\r\nin a district of more humane agriculture, the mere praise of farming,\r\nwith its rich compensations for never-ending toil and care, would be a\r\ncongenial theme. The outcome of their combination was that a topic not\r\neasily idealized in treatment was omitted. The realistic value of the\r\npicture was impaired to the relief of both poet and patron. But what the\r\npoem gained as a beautiful aspiration it lost as a practical authority.\r\n\r\nCan we suppose that Vergil did not know how important a place in\r\ncontemporary agriculture was filled by slave-labour? I think not: surely\r\nit is inconceivable. What meets us at every turn in other writers\r\ncannot have been unknown to him. Macrobius[917] has preserved for us\r\na curious record belonging to 43 BC, when the great confiscations and\r\nassignations of land were being carried out in the Cisalpine by order\r\nof the Triumvirs. Money and arms, needed for the coming campaign of\r\nPhilippi, were being requisitioned at the same time. The men of property\r\nthreatened by these exactions hid themselves. Their slaves were offered\r\nrewards and freedom if they would betray their masters’ hiding-places,\r\nbut not one of them yielded to the temptation. The commander who made\r\nthe offer was Pollio. No doubt domestics are chiefly meant, but there\r\nwere rustic slaves, and we have reason to think that they were humanely\r\ntreated in those parts. Dion Cassius[918] tells us that in 41 BC\r\nOctavian, under great pressure from the clamorous armies, saw nothing to\r\nbe done but to take all Italian lands from present owners and hand them\r\nover to the soldiers μετά τε τῆς δουλείας καὶ μετὰ τῆς ἄλλης κατασκευῆς.\r\nCircumstances necessitated compromise, which does not concern us here.\r\nBut it is well to remember that it was just the best land that the\r\nsoldiers wanted, and with it slaves and other farm-stock. For it was a\r\npension after service, not a hard life of bodily drudgery, that was in\r\nview. The plan of letting the former owner stay on as a tenant has been\r\nreferred to above.\r\n\r\nI hold then that Vergil’s silence on the topics to which I have called\r\nattention, however congenial it may have been to him, was intentional:\r\nand that the poem, published _in honorem Maecenatis_[919], was limited\r\nas to its practical outlook with the approval, if not at the suggestion,\r\nof the patron. It is essentially a literary work. In it Vergil’s power\r\nof gathering materials from all quarters and fusing them into a whole\r\nof his own creation is exemplified to a wonderful degree. His own deep\r\nlove of the country, with its homely sights and sounds, phenomena of a\r\nNature whose laws he felt unable to explore, helped him to execute the\r\ntask of recommending a social and economic reform through the medium of\r\npoetry. By ignoring topics deemed unsuitable, he left his sympathies\r\nand enthusiasm free course, and without sympathies and enthusiasm the\r\n_Georgics_ would not have been immortal. Even when digressing from\r\nagriculture, as in his opening address to the Emperor, there is more\r\nsincerity than we are at first disposed to grant. He had not been a\r\nRepublican, like Horace, and probably had been from the first attached to\r\nthe cause of the Caesars.\r\n\r\nI can discover no ground for thinking[920] that Vergil was ever himself\r\na farmer. That Pliny and Columella cite him as an authority is in my\r\nopinion due to the predominance of his works in the literary world. As\r\nwriters of prose dealing with facts often of an uninspiring kind, it\r\nwould seem to raise the artistic tone of heavy paragraphs if the first\r\nname in Latin literature could be introduced with an apposite quotation\r\nin agreement with their own context. Vergil-worship began early and\r\nlasted long; and indeed his admirers in the present day are sometimes so\r\nabsorbed in finding[921] more and more in what he said that they do not\r\ntrouble themselves to ask whether there may not be some significance[922]\r\nin his silences. Rightly or wrongly, I am persuaded that this question\r\nought at least to be asked in connexion with the _Georgics_. I have\r\nreserved till the last a passage[923] of Seneca, in which he challenges\r\nthe authority of Vergil in some points connected with trees, speaking of\r\nhim as _Vergilius noster, qui non quid verissime sed quid decentissime\r\ndiceretur aspexit, nec agricolas docere voluit sed legentes delectare_.\r\nNow Seneca was devoted to the works of Vergil, and is constantly quoting\r\nthem. He has no prejudice against the poet. The view of the _Georgics_\r\nset forth in these words implies no literary dispraise, but a refusal to\r\nlet poetic excellence give currency to technical errors. Seneca is often\r\ntiresome, but in this matter his criticism is in my opinion sound. In the\r\nmatter of labour my contention is not that the poet has inadvertently\r\nerred, but that he has for some reason deliberately dissembled.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX. THE ELDER SENECA AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nThe comparatively silent interval, between the Augustan circle and\r\nthe new group of writers under Claudius and Nero, furnishes little of\r\nimportance. The one writer who stands out as giving us a few scraps of\r\nevidence is the =elder Seneca=, the earliest of the natives of Spain who\r\nmade their mark in Latin literature. But the character of his work, which\r\nconsists of examples of the treatment of problem-cases in the schools of\r\nrhetoric, makes him a very peculiar witness. When he tells us how this\r\nor that pleader of note made some point neatly, the words have their\r\nappropriate place in the texture of a particular argument. Often they\r\ncontain a fallacious suggestion or a misstatement useful for the purpose\r\nof _ex parte_ advocacy, but having as statements no authority whatever.\r\nStill there are a few references of significance and value. Thus, when\r\nthe poor man’s son refuses the rich man’s offer to adopt him, and his own\r\nfather approves the proposal, one rhetorician made the young man[924]\r\nsay ‘Great troops of slaves whom their lord does not know by sight, and\r\nthe farm-prisons echoing to the sound of the lash, have no charm for me:\r\nmy love for my father is an unbought love.’ Again, a poor man, whose\r\nproperty has been outrageously damaged by a rich neighbour, protests[925]\r\nagainst the whims of modern luxury. ‘Country districts’ he says ‘that\r\nonce were the plough-lands of whole communities are now each worked by\r\na single slave-gang, and the sway of stewards is wider than the realms\r\nof kings.’ Now, we cannot cite the old rhetorician as an authority on\r\nagriculture directly: but he gives us proof positive that references to\r\nestates worked by gangs[926] of slaves, and the _ergastula_ in which the\r\npoor wretches were shut up after the hours of labour, would not in his\r\ntime sound strange to Roman audiences. Another passage[927] touches on a\r\nvery typical lecture-room theme, an unnatural son. A father is banished\r\nfor unintentional homicide. The law forbids the sheltering and feeding\r\nof an exile. But the father contrives to return and haunt an estate\r\nadjoining the main property, now controlled by his son. The son hears\r\nof these visits, flogs the _vilicus_ for connivance, and compels him to\r\nexclude the old man. The piece is one of which only a brief abstract\r\nremains, but there is enough to shew that, while the gist of it was a\r\ncasuistic discussion of a moral problem, it assumes as a matter of course\r\nthe liability of a trusted slave to the lash. The faithful and kindly\r\nslave is contrasted with the unnatural son. There are in these curious\r\ncollections other utterances indicative of the spread of humanitarian\r\nnotions. Thus in the piece first cited[928] above, the poor man’s son in\r\nrefusing the rich man’s offer of adoption, as a situation to which he\r\ncould never accommodate himself, is made to add ‘If you were selling a\r\nfavourite slave, you would inquire whether the buyer was a cruel man.’\r\nSuch ideas come from the later Greek philosophies, chiefly Stoic, the\r\nsystem on which Seneca brought up his more famous son. In one place[929]\r\nwe find an echo of an earlier Greek sentiment, when a rhetorician\r\npropounds the doctrine that Fortune only, not Nature, distinguishes\r\nfreemen from slaves.\r\n\r\nIndeed it is evident, from the many passages that touch on slavery and\r\nexpose some of its worst horrors, that the subject was at this time\r\nbeginning to attract more general attention than heretofore. And the\r\nrelations of patron and freedman, also discussed in these artificial\r\nschool-debates, are a further illustration of this tendency. Milder\r\nand more humane principles were germinating, though as yet they had\r\nnot found expression in law. In arguing on a peculiarly revolting case\r\n(the deliberate mutilation of child-beggars) a speaker incidentally\r\nrefers[930] to wealthy landowners recruiting their slave-gangs by seizing\r\nfreemen. The hearers are supposed to receive this reference to kidnapping\r\nas no exceptional thing extravagantly suggested. We have seen that both\r\nAugustus and Tiberius had to intervene to put down this _suppressio_.\r\nOne little note of interest deserves passing mention. In a discussion on\r\nunequal marriages the question is raised whether even the very highest\r\ndesert on a slave’s part could justify a father in taking him as a\r\nson-in-law. A speaker cites the case[931] of Old Cato, who married the\r\ndaughter of his own _colonus_. Here we clearly have the tenant farmer in\r\nthe second century BC In Plutarch the man appears as a client. Neither\r\nwriter makes him a freedman in so many words. But it is probably the\r\nunderlying fact. That the daughter was _ingenua_ does not rule out this\r\nsupposition.\r\n\r\n=Velleius= and =Valerius Maximus= also belong to the reign of Tiberius.\r\nThe former in what remains of his history supplies nothing to my purpose.\r\nValerius made a collection of anecdotes from Roman and foreign histories\r\nillustrating various virtues and vices, classifying the examples of good\r\nand bad action under heads. They are ‘lifted’ from the works of earlier\r\nwriters: many are taken from Livy, already used as a classic quarry.\r\nThe book is pervaded by tiresome moralizing, and points of interest are\r\nfew. There is the story of the farm[932] of Regulus, of the patriotic\r\nrefusal[933] of M’ Curius to take more than the normal seven _iugera_ of\r\nland as a reward from the state, of the horny-handed rustic voter[934]\r\nbeing asked whether he walked on his hands; also reference to the simple\r\nhabits of the famous Catos, and a passing remark that the men of old had\r\nfew slaves. Those of the above passages that are of any value at all\r\nhave been noticed in earlier sections. The freedman =Phaedrus= gives us\r\nnext to nothing in his fables, unless we care to note the items[935]\r\nof a farm-property, _agellos pecora villam operarios boves iumenta et\r\ninstrumentum rusticum_, and a fable specially illustrating the fact that\r\na master’s eye sees what escapes the notice of the slave-staff, even of\r\nthe _vilicus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI. SENECA THE YOUNGER.\r\n\r\nThe chief literary figure of the reigns of Claudius and Nero was =L\r\nAnnaeus Seneca=, a son of the rhetorician above referred to, and like\r\nhis father born in Spain. His life extended from 4 BC to 65 AD. For the\r\npurpose of the present inquiry his surviving works are mainly of interest\r\nas giving us in unmistakeable tones the point of view from which a man of\r\nStoic principles regarded slavery as a social institution. The society of\r\nimperial Rome, in which he spent most of his life, was politically dead.\r\nTo meddle with public affairs was dangerous. Even a senator needed to\r\nwalk warily, for activity was liable to be misinterpreted by the Emperor\r\nand by his powerful freedmen[936], who were in effect Imperial Ministers.\r\nTo keep on good terms with these departmental magnates, who had sprung\r\nfrom the slave-market to be courted as the virtual rulers of freeborn\r\nRoman citizens, was necessary for all men of note. Under such conditions\r\nit is not wonderful that the wealthy were tempted to assert themselves in\r\nostentatious luxury and dissipation: for a life of careless debauchery\r\nwas on the face of it hardly compatible with treasonable conspiracy. The\r\nimmense slave-households of Rome were a part and an expression of this\r\nextravagance; and the fashion of these domestic armies was perhaps at its\r\nheight in this period. Now, nothing kept the richer Romans in subjection\r\nmore efficiently than this habit of living constantly exposed to the\r\neyes and ears of their menials. Cruel laws might protect the master from\r\nassassination by presuming[937] the guilt of all slaves who might have\r\nprevented it. They could not protect him from the danger of criminal\r\ncharges, such as treason[938], supported by servile evidence: indeed the\r\nslave was a potential informer, and a hated master was at the mercy of\r\nhis slaves. Under some Emperors this possibility was a grim reality, and\r\nno higher or more heartfelt praise could be bestowed[939] on an Emperor\r\nthan that he refused to allow masters to be done to death by the tongue\r\nof their slaves.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the slave was still legally[940] his (or her) master’s\r\nchattel, and cases of revolting cruelty[941] and other abominations\r\noccurred from time to time. Yet more humane and sympathetic views were\r\nalready affecting public sentiment, chiefly owing to the spread of\r\nStoic doctrines among the cultivated classes. Of these doctrines as\r\nadapted to Roman minds Seneca was the leading preacher. Thus he cites\r\nthe definition of ‘slave’ as ‘wage-earner for life,’ propounded[942] by\r\nChrysippus: he insists on the human quality common to slave and free\r\nalike: he reasserts the equality of human rights, only upset by Fortune,\r\nwho has made one man master of another: he sees that the vices of slaves\r\nare very often simply the result of the misgovernment of their owners: he\r\nreckons them as humble members[943] of the family circle, perhaps even\r\nthe former playmates of boyhood: he recommends a kindly consideration\r\nfor a slave’s feelings, and admits[944] that some sensitive natures\r\nwould prefer a flogging to a box on the ear or a harsh and contemptuous\r\nscolding. We need not follow up his doctrines in more detail. The\r\ngeneral tone is evident and significant enough. But it is the relations\r\nof the domestic circle that he has primarily in view. His references\r\nto agriculture and rustic labour are few, as we might expect from the\r\ncircumstances of his life. But we are in a better position to judge\r\ntheir value having considered his attitude towards slavery in general.\r\nIt should be noted, as a specimen of his tendency to Romanize Greek\r\ndoctrine, that he lays great stress on the more wholesome relations[945]\r\nof master and slave in the good old times of early Rome,—here too without\r\nspecial reference to the rustic households of the rude forefathers round\r\nwhich tradition centred.\r\n\r\nJudged by a modern standard, a defect in Stoic principles was the\r\nphilosophic aloofness from the common interests and occupations of\r\nordinary workaday life. To the Wise Man all things save Virtue are more\r\nor less indifferent, and in the practice of professions and trades there\r\nis little or no direct connexion with Virtue. Contempt for manual labour,\r\nnormal in the ancient world and indeed in all slaveowning societies, took\r\na loftier position under the influence of Stoicism. Hence that system,\r\nin spite of its harsh and tiresome features, appealed to many of the\r\nbetter Romans of the upper class, seeming as it did to justify their\r\nhabitual disdain. Seneca’s attitude towards handicrafts is much the same\r\nas Cicero’s, only with a touch of Stoic priggishness added. Wisdom, he\r\nsays[946], is not a mere handworker (_opifex_) turning out appliances for\r\nnecessary uses. Her function is more important: her craft is the art of\r\nliving, and over other arts she is supreme. The quality of an artist’s\r\naction[947] depends on his motive: the sculptor may make a statue for\r\nmoney or to win fame or as a pious offering. Arts, as Posidonius[948]\r\nsaid, range from the ‘liberal’ ones to the ‘common and mean’ ones\r\npractised by handworkers: the latter have no pretence of moral dignity.\r\nIndeed many of these trades are quite unnecessary, the outcome of\r\nmodern[949] extravagance. We could do without them, and be all the better\r\nfor it: man’s real needs are small. But to work for a living is not in\r\nitself a degradation: did not the Stoic master Cleanthes draw water[950]\r\nfor hire? In short, the Wise Man may be a king or a slave, millionaire or\r\npauper. The externals cannot change his true quality, though they may be\r\na help or a hindrance in his growth to perfect wisdom.\r\n\r\nIn his references to agriculture and country matters it is to be remarked\r\nthat Seneca confirms the impression derived from other sources, that the\r\nletting of land to tenant farmers was on the increase. Discoursing on the\r\ngreedy luxury of the rich, their monstrous kitchens and cellars, and the\r\ntoiling of many to gratify the desires of one, he continues ‘Look at all\r\nthe places where the earth is being tilled, and at all the thousands[951]\r\nof farmers (_colonorum_) ploughing and digging; is this, think you, to\r\nbe reckoned one man’s belly, for whose service crops are being raised\r\nin Sicily and in Africa too?’ The _coloni_ here mentioned may be merely\r\n‘cultivators’ in a general sense. But I think they are more probably\r\ntenants of holdings on great estates. In speaking of his arrival at his\r\nAlban villa, and finding nothing ready for a meal, he philosophically\r\nrefuses to let so small an inconvenience make him angry with his cook\r\nand his baker. ‘My baker[952] has got no bread; but the steward has\r\nsome, and so have the porter and the farmer.’ A coarse sort of bread, no\r\ndoubt, but you have only got to wait, and you will enjoy it when you are\r\nreally hungry. Here we seem to have an instance of what was now probably\r\nan ordinary arrangement: the _villa_, homestead with some land round it,\r\nkept as a country ‘box’ for the master by his steward, who would see to\r\nthe garden and other appurtenances, while the rest of the land is let to\r\na humble tenant farmer. In another passage we have an interesting glimpse\r\nof a tenant’s legal position[953] as against his landlord. ‘If a landlord\r\ntramples down growing crops or cuts down plantations, he cannot keep\r\nhis tenant, though the lease may be still in being: this is not because\r\nhe has recovered what was due to him as lessor, but because he has made\r\nit impossible for him to recover it. Even so it often happens that a\r\ncreditor is cast in damages to his debtor, when he has on other grounds\r\ntaken from him more than the amount of the debt claimed.’ I gather from\r\nthis passage that damage done by the lessor to the lessee’s interest\r\nin the farm deprived him of right of action against the lessee, in case\r\nhe wanted to enforce some claim (for rent or for some special service)\r\nunder the terms of the existing contract[954] of lease. If this inference\r\nbe just, the evidence is important. For the _colonus_ is conceived as a\r\nhumble person, whose interest a brutal inconsiderate landlord would be\r\nnot unlikely to disregard, and to whom a resort to litigation would seem\r\na course to be if possible avoided.\r\n\r\nTo this question of the rights of landlord and tenant Seneca returns\r\nlater, when engaged in reconciling the Stoic thesis that ‘all things\r\nbelong to the Wise Man’ with the facts of actual life. The Wise Man is\r\nin the position of a King to whom belongs the general right of sovranty\r\n(_imperium_) while his subjects have the particular right of ownership\r\n(_dominium_). Illustrating the point he proceeds[955] thus. ‘Say I have\r\nhired a house from you. Of its contents some belong to you and some to\r\nme. The thing (_res_) is your property, but the right of user (_usus_)\r\nof your property is mine. Just so you must not meddle with crops, though\r\ngrown on your own estate, if your tenant forbids it; and in a season of\r\ndearness or dearth you will be like the man in Vergil wistfully gazing\r\nat another’s plenteous store, though the land where it grew, the yard\r\nwhere it is stacked, and the granary it is meant to fill, are all your\r\nown property. Nor, when I have hired a lodging, have you a right to enter\r\nit, owner though you be: when a slave of yours is hired for service\r\nby me, you have no right to withdraw him: and, if I hire a trap from\r\nyou and give you a lift, it will be a good turn on my part, though the\r\nconveyance belongs to you.’ I have quoted this at some length, in order\r\nto make the farm-tenant’s position quite clear. His rights are presumed\r\nto be easily ascertainable, and his assertion of them will be protected\r\nby the law. His contract, whether a formal lease or not, is also presumed\r\nto guarantee him complete control of the subject for the agreed term.\r\nWhether encroachments by landlords and legal proceedings for redress by\r\ntenants were common events in rural Italy, Seneca need not and does not\r\nsay. I suspect that personal interest on both sides was in practice a\r\nmore effective restraint than appeals to law.\r\n\r\nThere are other references to agricultural conditions, which though of\r\nless importance are interesting as confirming other evidence as to the\r\n_latifundia_ of this period. A good specimen is found in his denunciation\r\nof human greed as the cause of poverty, by bringing to an end the\r\nhappy age of primitive communism, when all shared the ownership of all.\r\nCramped and unsatisfied, this _avaritia_ can never find the way back to\r\nthe old state of plenty and happiness. ‘Hence, though she now endeavour\r\nto make good[956] what she has wasted; though she add field to field by\r\nbuying out her neighbours or wrongfully ejecting them; though she expand\r\nher country estates on the scale of provinces, and enjoy the sense of\r\nlandlordism in the power of touring mile after mile without leaving her\r\nown domains; still no enlargement of bounds will bring us back to the\r\npoint from whence we started.’ Again, in protesting against the luxurious\r\nostentation of travellers and others, he shews that they are really in\r\ndebt. ‘So-and-so is, you fancy, a rich man ... because he has arable\r\nestates[957] in all provinces of the empire ... because his holding of\r\nland near Rome is on a scale one would grudge him even in the wilds of\r\nApulia.’ Such a man is in debt to Fortune. In these as in other passages\r\nthe preacher illustrates his sermon by references calculated to bring\r\nhome his points. Naturally he selects for the purpose matters familiar to\r\nhis audience; and it is this alone that makes the passages worth quoting.\r\nThe same may be said of his sympathetic reference[958] to the hard lot of\r\na slave transferred from the easy duties of urban service to the severe\r\ntoil of farm labour. In general it may be remarked that the evidence of\r\nSeneca and other literary men of this period is to be taken in connexion\r\nwith the treatise of Columella, who is the contemporary specialist\r\non agriculture. The prevalence of slave labour and the growth of the\r\ntenant-farmer class are attested by both lines of evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII. LUCAN, PETRONIUS, AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\n=Lucan=, Seneca’s nephew, has a few interesting references in his poem\r\non the great civil war. Thus, in the eloquent passage[959] lamenting\r\nthe decay of Roman vital strength, a long process to be disastrously\r\ncompleted in the great Pharsalian battle, he dwells on the shrinkage of\r\nfree Roman population in Italy. The towns and the countryside alike are\r\nempty, houses deserted, and it is by the labour of chained[960] slaves\r\nthat Italian crops are raised. Elsewhere[961] he looks further back,\r\nand traces this decay to the effect of luxury and corruption caused by\r\nthe influx of vast wealth, the spoils of Roman conquests. Among the\r\nsymptoms of disease he notes the _latifundia_, which it was now becoming\r\nthe fashion to denounce, the land-grabbing passion that prompted men to\r\nmonopolize great tracts of land and incorporate in huge estates, worked\r\nby cultivators unknown[962] to them, farms that once had been ploughed\r\nand hoed by the rustic heroes of old. But all such utterances are merely\r\na part of a declaimer’s stock-in-trade. We may fairly guess that they are\r\nechoes of talk heard in the literary circle of his uncle Seneca. That\r\nthey are nevertheless consistent with the land-system of this period, is\r\nto be gathered from other sources, such as Petronius and Columella. It\r\nremains to note that the word _colonus_ is used by Lucan in the senses of\r\n‘cultivator’ and ‘farmer,’ rather suggesting ownership, and of ‘military\r\ncolonist,’ clearly implying it. That of ‘tenant’ does not occur: there\r\nwas no need for it in the poem. Again, he has _servire servilis_ and\r\n_servitium_, but _servus_ occurs only in a suspected[963] line, and as an\r\nadjective. His regular word for ‘slave’ is _famulus_.\r\n\r\nThe bucolic poems of this period are too manifestly artificial to serve\r\nas evidence of value. For instance, when =Calpurnius= declares[964] that\r\nin this blessed age of peace and prosperity the _fossor_ is not afraid\r\nto profit by the treasure he may chance to dig up, we cannot infer that\r\na free digger is meant, though it is hardly likely that a slave would be\r\nsuffered to keep treasure-trove.\r\n\r\n=Petronius=, in the curious mixed prose-verse satire of which part\r\nhas come down to us, naturally says very little bearing directly on\r\nagriculture. But in depicting the vulgar freedman-millionaire Trimalchio\r\nhe refers pointedly to the vast landed estates belonging to this typical\r\nfigure of the period. He owns estates ‘far as the kites[965] can fly.’\r\nThis impression is confirmed in detail by a report delivered by the\r\nagent for his properties. It is a statement[966] of the occurrences in\r\na domain of almost imperial proportions during a single day. So many\r\nchildren, male and female, were born: so many thousand bushels of wheat\r\nwere stocked in the granary: so many hundred oxen broken in: a slave was\r\ncrucified for disloyalty to his lord: so many million sesterces were\r\npaid in to the chest, no opening for investment presenting itself. On\r\none park-estate (_hortis_) there was a great fire, which began in the\r\nsteward’s house. Trimalchio cannot recall the purchase of this estate,\r\nwhich on inquiry turns out to be a recent acquisition not yet on the\r\nbooks. Then comes the reading of notices issued by officials[967] of the\r\nmanors, of wills[968] made by rangers, of the names of his stewards; of\r\na freedwoman’s divorce, the banishment of an _atriensis_, the committal\r\nof a cashier for trial, and the proceedings in court in an action between\r\nsome chamberlains. Of course all this is not to be taken seriously, but\r\nwe can form some notion of the state of things that the satirist has in\r\nmind. Too gross an exaggeration would have defeated his purpose. The book\r\nis full of passages bearing on the history of slavery, but it is domestic\r\nslavery, and that often of the most degrading character.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII. COLUMELLA.\r\n\r\nThe great interest taken in agriculture after the establishment of the\r\nRoman peace by Augustus is shewn by the continued appearance of works on\r\nthe subject. The treatise of =Celsus=, who wrote in the time of Tiberius,\r\nwas part of a great encyclopaedic work. It was probably one of the most\r\nimportant books of its kind: but it is lost, and we only know it as cited\r\nby other writers, such as Columella and the elder Pliny. It is from the\r\ntreatise of =Columella=, composed probably under Nero, that we get most\r\nof our information as to Roman husbandry (_rusticatio_, as he often calls\r\nit) in the period of the earlier Empire. The writer was a native of\r\nSpain, deeply interested, like other Spanish Romans, in the past present\r\nand future of Italy. It is evident that in comparing the present with the\r\npast he could not avoid turning an uneasy eye to the future. Like others,\r\nhe could see that agriculture, once the core of Roman strength, the nurse\r\nof a vigorous free population, was in a bad way. It was still the case\r\nthat the choicest farm-lands of Italy were largely occupied by mansions\r\nand parks, the property of non-resident owners who seldom visited their\r\nestates, and hardly ever qualified themselves to superintend their\r\nmanagement intelligently. The general result was hideous waste. In modern\r\nlanguage, those who had command of capital took no pains to employ it in\r\nbusiness-like farming: while the remaining free rustics lacked capital.\r\nAgriculture was likely to go from bad to worse under such conditions. The\r\nEmpire would thus be weakened at its centre, and to a loyal Provincial,\r\nwhose native land was part of a subject world grouped round that centre,\r\nthe prospect might well seem bewildering. Columella was from the first\r\ninterested in agriculture, on which his uncle[969] at Gades (Cadiz)\r\nwas a recognized authority, and his treatise _de re rustica_ is his\r\ncontribution to the service of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe serious consequences of the decay of practical farming, and the\r\ndisappearance of the small landowners tilling their own land, had long\r\nbeen recognized by thoughtful men. But the settlement of discharged\r\nsoldiers on allotted holdings had not repopulated the countryside with\r\nfree farmers. The old lamentations continued, but no means was found\r\nfor solving the problem how to recreate a patient and prosperous yeoman\r\nclass, firmly planted on the soil. Technical knowledge had gone on\r\naccumulating to some extent, though the authorities on agriculture, Greek\r\nCarthaginian or Roman, appealed to by Columella are mainly the same as\r\nthose cited by Varro some eighty years before. The difficulty at both\r\nepochs was not the absence of knowledge but the neglect of its practical\r\napplication. Columella, like his forerunners, insists on the folly[970]\r\nof buying more land than you can profitably manage. But it seems that\r\nthe average wealthy landowner could not resist the temptation to round\r\noff[971] a growing estate by buying up more land when a favourable\r\nopportunity occurred. It is even hinted that ill-treatment[972] of a\r\nneighbour, to quicken the process by driving him to give up his land,\r\nwas not obsolete. Moreover, great estates often consisted of separate\r\nholdings in different parts of the country. For owners of vast, and\r\nsometimes[973] scattered, estates to keep effective control over them\r\nwas an occupation calling for qualities never too common, technical\r\nskill and indefatigable industry. The former could, if combined with\r\nperfect honesty, be found in an ideal deputy; but the deputy, to be under\r\ncomplete control, must be a slave: and, the more skilled the slave, the\r\nbetter able he was to conceal dishonesty. Therefore, the more knowledge\r\nand watchful attentiveness was needed in the master. Now it is just this\r\ngenuine and painstaking interest in the management of their estates that\r\nColumella finds lacking in Roman landlords. They will not live[974]\r\nin the country, where they are quickly bored and miss the excitements\r\nof the city, and My Lady detests country life even more than My Lord.\r\nBut they will not even take the trouble to procure good[975] Stewards,\r\nlet alone watching them so as to keep them industrious and honest.\r\nThus the management of estates has generally passed from masters to\r\n_vilici_, and the domestic part of the duties even more completely from\r\nhouse-mistresses to _vilicae_. As to the disastrous effect of the change\r\nupon rustic economy, the writer entertains no doubt. But the evil was\r\nno new phenomenon. It may well be that it was now more widespread than\r\nin Varro’s time; but in both writers we may perhaps suspect some degree\r\nof overstatement, to which reformers are apt to resort in depicting\r\nthe abuses they are wishing to reform. I do not allow much for this\r\nconsideration, for the picture, confirmed by general literary evidence,\r\nis in the main unquestionably true.\r\n\r\nSo much for the case of estates administered by slave stewards for the\r\naccount of their masters. But this was not the only way of dealing with\r\nlanded properties. We have already noted the system of letting farms to\r\ncultivating tenants, and commented on the fewness of the references to it\r\nin literature. This plan may have been very ancient in origin, but it was\r\nprobably an exceptional arrangement even in the time of Cicero. The very\r\nslight notice of it by Varro indicates that it was not normal, indeed\r\nnot even common. In Columella we find a remarkable change. In setting\r\nout the main principles[976] of estate management, and insisting on the\r\nprime importance of the owner’s attention (_cura domini_), he adds that\r\nthis is necessary above all things in relation to the persons concerned\r\n(_in hominibus_). Now the _homines_ are _coloni_ or _servi_, and are\r\nunchained or chained. After this division and subdivision he goes on to\r\ndiscuss briefly but thoroughly the proper relations between landlord and\r\ntenant-farmer, the care needed in the selection of satisfactory tenants,\r\nand the considerations that must guide a landlord in deciding whether to\r\nlet a piece of land to a tenant or to farm it for his own account. He\r\nadvises him to be obliging and easy in his dealings with tenants, and\r\nmore insistent in requiring their work or service (_opus_)[977] than\r\ntheir rent (_pensiones_): this plan is less irritating, and after all it\r\npays better in the long run. For, barring risks of storms or brigands,\r\ngood farming nearly always leaves a profit, so that the tenant has not\r\nthe face to claim[978] a reduction of rent. A landlord should not be a\r\nstickler for trifles or mean in the matter of little perquisites, such as\r\ncutting firewood, worrying his tenant unprofitably. But, while waiving\r\nthe full rigour of the law, he should not omit to claim his dues in order\r\nto keep alive his rights: wholesale remission is a mistake. It was well\r\nsaid by a great landowner that the greatest blessing for an estate is\r\nwhen the tenants are natives[979] of the place, a sort of hereditary\r\noccupiers, attached to it by the associations of their childhood’s home.\r\nColumella agrees that frequent changes of tenant are a bad business. But\r\nthere is a worse; namely the town-bred[980] tenant, who prefers farming\r\nwith a slave staff to turning farmer himself. It was a saying of Saserna,\r\nthat out of a fellow of this sort you generally get not your rent but a\r\nlawsuit. His advice then was, take pains to get country-bred farmers[981]\r\nand keep them in permanent tenancy: that is, when you are not free to\r\nfarm your own land, or when it does not suit your interest to farm it\r\nwith a slave staff. This last condition, says Columella, only refers to\r\nthe case of lands derelict[982] through malaria or barren soil.\r\n\r\nThere are however farms on which it is the landlord’s own interest to\r\nplace tenants rather than work them by slaves for his own account. Such\r\nare distant holdings, too out-of-the-way for the proprietor to visit them\r\neasily. Slaves out of reach of constant inspection will play havoc with\r\nany farm, particularly one on which corn is grown. They let out the oxen\r\nfor hire, neglect the proper feeding of live stock, shirk the thorough\r\nturning of the earth, and in sowing tending harvesting and threshing the\r\ncrop they waste and cheat you to any extent. No wonder the farm gets a\r\nbad name thanks to your steward and staff. If you do not see your way\r\nto attend in person to an estate of this kind, you had better let it to\r\na tenant. From these remarks it seems clear that the writer looks upon\r\nletting land to tenant farmers as no more than an unwelcome alternative,\r\nto be adopted only in the case of farms bad in quality or out of easy\r\nreach. Indeed he says frankly that, given fair average conditions, the\r\nowner can always get better returns by managing a farm himself than by\r\nletting it to a tenant: he may even do better by leaving the charge\r\nto a steward, unless of course that steward happens to be an utterly\r\ncareless or thievish fellow. Taking this in connexion with his remarks\r\nabout stewards elsewhere, the net result seems to be that a landlord must\r\nchoose in any given case what he judges to be the less of two evils.\r\n\r\nA few points here call for special consideration. In speaking of the\r\nwork or service (_opus_) that a landlord may require of a tenant, as\r\ndistinct from rent, what does Columella precisely mean? It has been\r\nheld[983] that he refers to the landlord’s right of insisting that\r\nhis land shall be well farmed. This presumably implies a clause in\r\nthe lease under which such a right could be enforced. But there are\r\ndifficulties. In the case of a distant farm, let to a tenant because\r\nit has ‘to do without the presence[984] of the landlord,’ the right\r\nwould surely be inoperative in practice. In the case of a neighbouring\r\nfarm, why has the landlord not kept it in hand, putting in a steward\r\nto manage it? This interpretation leaves us with no clear picture of\r\na practical arrangement. But this objection is perhaps not fatal. The\r\nright to enforce proper cultivation is plainly guaranteed to landlords\r\nin Roman Law, as the jurists constantly assert in discussing tenancies.\r\nAnd _opus_ is a term employed[985] by them in this connexion. It is\r\ntherefore the safer course to take it here in this sense, and to allow\r\nfor a certain want of clearness in Columella’s phrase. At the same time\r\nit is tempting to accept another[986] view, namely this, that the writer\r\nhas in mind service rendered in the form of a stipulated amount of\r\nauxiliary labour on the landlord’s ‘Home Farm’ at certain seasons. That a\r\n_corvée_ arrangement of this kind existed as a matter of course on some\r\nestates, we have direct evidence[987] in the second century, evidence\r\nthat suggests an earlier origin for the custom. True, it implies that\r\nlandlords were in practice able to impose the burden of such task-work on\r\ntheir free tenants, in short that they had the upper hand in the bargain\r\nbetween the parties. But this is not surprising: for we read[988] of a\r\ngreat landlord calling up his _coloni_ to serve on his private fleet\r\nin the great civil war, a hundred years before Columella. Still, it is\r\nperhaps rash to see in this passage a direct reference to the custom\r\nof making the supply of auxiliary labour at certain seasons a part of\r\ntenant’s obligations. Granting this, it is nevertheless reasonable to\r\nbelieve that the first beginnings of the custom may belong to a date at\r\nleast as early as the treatise of Columella. For it is quite incredible\r\nthat such a practice should spring up and become prevalent suddenly. It\r\nhas all the marks of gradual growth.\r\n\r\nAnother point of interest is the criticism of the town-bred _colonus_. He\r\nprefers to work the farm with a slave staff, rather than undertake the\r\njob himself. I gather from this that he is a man with capital, also that\r\nhe means to get a good return on his capital. He fears to make a loss on\r\na rustic venture, being well aware of his own inexperience. So he will\r\nput in a steward with a staff of slaves. The position of the steward will\r\nin such a case be peculiarly strong. If he is slack and thievish and lets\r\ndown the farm, he can stave off his master’s anger by finding fault with\r\nthe soil or buildings, and involve the tenant and landlord in a quarrel\r\nover the rent. To devise pretexts would be easy for a rogue, and a\r\nquarrel might end in a lawsuit. That Saserna, writing probably about 100\r\nBC, laid his finger on this possible source of trouble, is significant.\r\nIt is evidence that there were tenant-farmers in his time, and bad ones\r\namong them: but not that they were then numerous, or that their general\r\ncharacter was such as to make landlords let their estates in preference\r\nto managing them through their own stewards for their own account. And\r\nthis agrees with Columella’s own opinion some 150 years later. If you are\r\nto let farms to tenants, local men who are familiar with local conditions\r\nare to be preferred, but he gives no hint that such tenants could readily\r\nbe found. His words seem rather to imply that they were rare.\r\n\r\nOne point is hardly open to misunderstanding. In Columella’s system the\r\ntypical tenant-farmer, the _colonus_ to be desired by a wise landlord, is\r\na humble person, to whom small perquisites are things of some importance.\r\nHe is not a restless or ambitious being, ever on the watch for a chance\r\nof putting his landlord in the wrong or a pretext for going to law. Such\r\nas we see him in the references of Seneca, and later in those of the\r\nyounger Pliny and Martial, such he appears in Columella. For the landlord\r\nit is an important object to keep him—when he has got him—and to have his\r\nson ready as successor in the tenancy. From other sources we know[989]\r\nthat the value of long undisturbed tenancies are generally recognized.\r\nBut we have little or nothing to shew whether the tenant-farmers of\r\nthis age usually worked with their own hands or not. That they employed\r\nslave labour is not only _a priori_ probable, but practically certain.\r\nWe have evidence that at a somewhat later date it was customary[990]\r\nfor the landlord to provide land farmstead (_villa_) and equipment\r\n(_instrumentum_), and we know that under this last head slaves could be\r\nand were concluded. It is evident that the arrangement belongs to the\r\ndecisive development of the tenancy system as a regular alternative to\r\nthat of farming by a steward for landlord’s own account. The desirable\r\ncountry-bred tenant would not be a man[991] of substantial capital,\r\nand things had to be made easy for him. It is not clear that a tenant\r\nbringing his own staff of slaves would have been welcomed as lessee: from\r\nthe instance of the town-bred _colonus_ just referred to it seems likely\r\nthat he would not.\r\n\r\nWhile Columella prescribes letting to tenants as the best way of solving\r\nthe difficulties in dealing with outlying farms, he does not say that\r\nthis plan should not be adopted in the case of farms near the main\r\nestate or ‘Home Farm.’ I think this silence is intentional. It is hard\r\nto believe that there were no instances of landlords either wholly\r\nnon-resident or who so seldom visited their estates that they could not\r\npossibly keep an eye on the doings of stewards. In such cases there would\r\nbe strong inducement to adopt the plan by which they could simply draw\r\nrents and have no stewards to look after. That stewards needed to be\r\ncarefully watched was as clear to Columella as to Cato or Varro. True,\r\nletting to tenants was a policy liable to bring troubles of its own. We\r\nshall see in the case of the younger Pliny what they were and how he met\r\nthem. Meanwhile he may serve as an example of the system. It is also\r\nplain that a large continuous property could be divided[992] into smaller\r\nparcels for convenience of letting to tenants. Whether the later plan of\r\nkeeping a considerable Home Farm in hand under a steward, and letting off\r\nthe outer parcels of the same estate to tenants, was in vogue already and\r\ncontemplated by Columella, is not easy to say. In connexion with this\r\nquestion it is to be noted that he hardly refers at all to free hired\r\nlabour[993] as generally available. The migratory gangs of wage-earners,\r\nstill known to Varro, do not appear, nor do the itinerant _medici_. When\r\nhe speaks of hiring hands at any price, or of times when labour is cheap,\r\nhe may mean hiring somebody’s slaves, and probably does. Slave labour is\r\nundoubtedly the basis of his farm-system, and its elaborate organization\r\nfills an important part of his book. Yet two marked consequences of\r\nthe Roman Peace had to be taken into account. Fewer wars meant fewer\r\nslaves in the market, and a rise of prices: peace and law in Italy meant\r\nthat big landowners could add field to field more securely than ever,\r\nwhile great numbers of citizens were settling in the Provinces, taking\r\nadvantage of better openings[994] there. To keep some free labour within\r\ncall as an occasional resource was an undeniable convenience for a large\r\nowner with a farm in hand. Small tenants[995] under obligation to render\r\nstipulated service at certain seasons would obviously supply the labour\r\nneeded. And, if we picture to ourselves a Home Farm round the lord’s\r\nmansion, worked by steward and slave staff, with outlying ‘soccage’\r\ntenants on holdings near, we are already in presence of a rudimentary\r\nManor. As time went by, and the system got into regular working order,\r\nthe landlord had an opportunity of strengthening his hold on the tenants.\r\nBy not pressing them too severely for arrears of rent, and occasionally\r\ngranting abatements, he could gradually increase their services. What\r\nhe thus saved on his own labour-bill might well be more than a set-off\r\nagainst the loss of money-rents. More and more the tenants would become\r\ndependent on him. Nominally free, they were becoming tied to the soil on\r\nonerous terms, and the foundation was laid of the later relation of Lord\r\nand Serf.\r\n\r\nSuch I conceive to be the rustic situation the beginnings of which are\r\nprobably to be placed as early as Columella’s time, though we do not\r\nfind him referring to it. He says nothing of another point, which was\r\nof importance[996] later, namely the admission of slaves or freedmen as\r\ntenants of farms. It has all the appearance of a subsequent step, taken\r\nwhen the convenience of services rendered by resident tenants had been\r\ndemonstrated by experience. It is no great stretch of imagination to\r\nsuggest that, as the supply of slaves fell off, it was the policy of\r\nowners to turn their slave-property to the best possible account. When a\r\nsteward or a gang-foreman was no longer in his prime, able (as Columella\r\nenjoins) to turn to and shew the common hands how work should be done,\r\nhow could he best be utilized? A simple plan was to put him on a small\r\nfarm with a few slave labourers. This would secure the presence of a\r\ntenant whose dependence was certain from the first, while a younger man\r\ncould be promoted to the arduous duties of the big Home Farm. Be this\r\nas it may, it is certain that problems arising from shortage of slaves\r\nwere presenting themselves in the middle of the first century AD. For\r\nslave-breeding, casual in Cato’s day and incidentally mentioned by Varro,\r\nis openly recognized by Columella, who allows for a larger female element\r\nin his farm staff and provides rewards for their realized fertility.\r\n\r\nIf the system of farm-tenancies was already becoming a part of\r\nland-management so important as the above remarks may seem to imply, why\r\ndoes the management of a landed estate for landlord’s account under a\r\nsteward occupy almost the whole of Columella’s long treatise? I think\r\nthere are several reasons. First, it is management of tillage-crops and\r\ngardens and live stock with which he is chiefly concerned, not tenures\r\nand labour-questions: and technical skill in agriculture is of interest\r\nto all connected with it, though the book is primarily addressed to\r\nlandlords. Secondly, the desirable tenant was (and is) a man not much in\r\nneed of being taught his business: as for an undesirable one, the sooner\r\nhe is got rid of the better. Thirdly, the plan of steward-management was\r\nstill the normal one: the only pity was that the indolence of owners\r\nled to appointment of bad stewards and left them too much power. Only\r\nsound knowledge can enable landlords to choose good stewards and check\r\nbad management. Seeing agriculture in a bad way, Columella writes to\r\nsupply this knowledge, as Cato Varro and others had done before him.\r\nAccordingly he begins with the general organization of the normal large\r\nestate, and first discusses the choice and duties of the _vilicus_,\r\non whose character and competence everything depends. To this subject\r\nhe returns in a later part of the treatise, and the two passages[997]\r\nenforce the same doctrine with very slight variations in detail.\r\n\r\nThe steward[998] must not be a fancy-slave, a domestic from the master’s\r\ntown house, but a well-tried hardy rustic, or at the very least one used\r\nto hard labour. He must not be too old, or he may break down under the\r\nstrain; nor too young, or the elder slaves will not respect him. He must\r\nbe a skilled farmer (this is most important)[999], or at least thoroughly\r\npainstaking, so as to pick up the business quickly: for the functions\r\nof teaching and giving orders cannot be separated. He need not be able\r\nto read and write, if his memory be very retentive. It is a remark of\r\nCelsus, that a steward of this sort brings his master cash more often\r\nthan a book: for he cannot make up false accounts himself, and fears to\r\ntrust an accomplice. But, good bad or indifferent, a steward must have\r\na female partner[1000] allotted him, to be a restraining influence on\r\nhim and in some respects a help. Being[1001] his master’s agent, he must\r\nbe enjoined not to live on terms of intimacy with any of the staff, and\r\nstill less with any outsider. Yet he may now and then invite a deserving\r\nworker to his table on a feast-day. He must not do sacrifice[1002]\r\nwithout orders, or meddle with divination. He must attend markets\r\nonly on strict business, and not gad about, unless it be to pick up\r\nwrinkles[1003] for the farm, and then only if the place visited be close\r\nat hand. He must not allow new pathways to be made on the farm, or admit\r\nas guests any but his master’s intimate friends. He must be instructed\r\nto attend carefully[1004] to the stock of implements and tools, keeping\r\neverything in duplicate and in good repair, so that there need be no\r\nborrowing from neighbours: for the waste of working time thus caused\r\nis a more serious item than the cost of such articles. He is to see to\r\nthe clothing[1005] of the staff (_familiam_) in practical garments that\r\nwill stand wet and cold: this done, some work in the open is possible in\r\nalmost any weather. He should be not only an expert in farm labour, but\r\na man of the highest mental and moral character[1006] compatible with\r\na slave-temperament. For his rule should be sympathetic but firm: he\r\nshould not be too hard[1007] upon the worse hands, while he encourages\r\nthe better ones, but aim at being feared for his strictness rather than\r\nloathed for harshness. The way to achieve this is to watch and prevent,\r\nnot to overlook and then punish. Even the most inveterate rogues are\r\nmost effectively controlled by insisting on performance[1008] of their\r\ntasks, ensuring them their due rights, and by the steward being always\r\non the spot. Under these conditions the various foremen[1009] will take\r\npains to carry out their several duties, while the common hands, tired\r\nout, will be more inclined to go to sleep than to get into mischief. Some\r\ngood old usages tending to promote content and good feeling are unhappily\r\ngone beyond recall, for instance[1010] the rule that a steward must not\r\nemploy a fellow-slave’s services on any business save that of his master.\r\nBut he must not suffer them to stray off the estate unless he sends them\r\non errands; and this only if absolutely necessary. He must not do any\r\ntrading[1011] on his own account, or employ his master’s cash in purchase\r\nof beasts etc. For this distracts a steward’s attention, and prevents the\r\ncorrect balancing of his accounts at the audit, when he can only produce\r\ngoods instead of money. In general, the first[1012] requisite is that he\r\nshould be free from conceit and eager to learn. For in farming mistakes\r\ncan never be redeemed: time lost is never regained: each thing must be\r\ndone right, once for all.\r\n\r\nThe above is almost a verbal rendering of Columella’s words. At this\r\npoint we may fairly pause to ask whether he seriously thought that an\r\nordinary landlord had much chance of securing such a paragon of virtue\r\nas this pattern steward. That all these high bodily mental and moral\r\nqualities combined in one individual could be bought in one lot at an\r\nauction[1013] must surely have been a chance so rare as to be hardly\r\nworth considering as a means of agricultural development. I take it\r\nthat the importance of extreme care in selecting the right man, and\r\nin keeping him to his duties, is insisted on as a protest against the\r\nculpable carelessness of contemporary landlords, of which he has spoken\r\nseverely above. If, as I believe, in the great majority of cases a new\r\nsteward required much instruction as to the details of his duties and as\r\nto the spirit in which he was both to rule the farm-staff and to serve\r\nhis master, surely the part to be played by the master himself[1014] was\r\nof fundamental importance: indeed little less so than in the scheme of\r\nold Cato. To Columella I am convinced that his recommendations stood for\r\nan ideal seldom, if ever, likely to be realized. To say this is not to\r\nblame the good man, but rather to hint that his precepts in general must\r\nnot be taken as evidence of a state of things then normally to be found\r\nexisting on farms. To express aspirations confesses the shortcomings of\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\nTo return to our author’s precepts. He goes on to tell us of his own way\r\nof treating[1015] his farm-hands, remarking that he has not regretted\r\nhis kindness. He talks to a rustic slave (provided he is a decent\r\nworker) more often, and more as man to man (_familiarius_) than he does\r\nto a town slave. It relieves the round of their toil. He even exchanges\r\npleasantries with them. He discusses new work-projects with the skilled\r\nhands and so tests their abilities: this flatters them, and they are\r\nmore ready to work on a job on which they have been consulted. There\r\nare other points of management on which all prudent masters are agreed,\r\nfor instance the inspection[1016] of the slaves in the lock-up. This\r\nis to ascertain whether they are carefully chained, and the chamber\r\nthoroughly secured, and whether the steward has chained or released any\r\nof them without his master’s knowledge. For he must not be permitted\r\nto release the chained on his own responsibility. The _paterfamilias_\r\nshould be all the more particular in his inquiries as to slaves of this\r\nclass, to see that they are dealt with fairly in matters of clothing\r\nand rations, inasmuch as they are under the control[1017] of several\r\nsuperiors, stewards foremen and warders. This position exposes them to\r\nunfair treatment, and they are apt to be more dangerous through resenting\r\nharshness and stinginess. So a careful master should question them as\r\nto whether they are getting[1018] their due allowance. He should taste\r\ntheir food and examine their clothes etc. He should hear and redress\r\ngrievances, punish the mutinous, and reward the deserving. Columella then\r\nrelates[1019] his own policy in dealing with female slaves. When one of\r\nthem had reared three or more children she was rewarded: for 3 she was\r\ngranted a holiday, for 4 she was manumitted. This is only fair, and it is\r\na substantial increment[1020] to your property. In general, a landlord\r\nis enjoined to observe religious duties, and to inspect the whole estate\r\nimmediately on his arrival from Town, checking all items carefully. This\r\ndone regularly year after year, he will enjoy order and obedience on his\r\nestate in his old age.\r\n\r\nNext comes a general statement of the proper classification of the\r\nslave staff according to varieties[1021] of function. For departmental\r\nforemen you should choose steady honest fellows, watchfulness and skill\r\nbeing needed rather than brute strength. The hind or plowman must be a\r\nbig man with a big voice, that the oxen may obey him. And the taller\r\nhe is the better will he throw his weight on the plough-tail. The mere\r\nunskilled labourer[1022] only needs to be fit for continuous hard work.\r\nFor instance, in a vineyard you want a thickset type of labourer to\r\nstand the digging etc, and if they are rogues it does not matter much,\r\nas they work in a gang under an overseer (_monitore_[1023]). By the by,\r\na scamp is generally more quick-witted than the average, and vineyard\r\nwork calls for intelligence: this is why chained hands[1024] are commonly\r\nemployed there. Of course, he adds, an honest man is more efficient than\r\na rogue, other things being equal: don’t charge me with a preference\r\nfor criminals. Another piece of advice is to avoid[1025] mixing up the\r\nvarious tasks performed by the staff on the plan of making every labourer\r\ndo every kind of work. It does not pay in farming. Either what is every\r\none’s business is felt to be nobody’s duty in particular; or the effort\r\nof the individual is credited to the whole of the gang. This sets him\r\nshirking, and yet you cannot single out the offender; and this sort of\r\nthing is constantly happening. Therefore keep plowmen vineyard-hands and\r\nunskilled labourers apart. Then he passes to numerical[1026] divisions.\r\nSquads (_classes_) should be of not more than ten men each, _decuriae_\r\nas the old name was, that the overseer may keep his eye on all. By\r\nspreading such squads over different parts of a large farm it is possible\r\nto compare results, to detect laziness, and to escape the irritating\r\nunfairness of punishing the wrong men.\r\n\r\nThe general impression left on a reader’s mind by Columella’s principles\r\nof slave-management is one of strict control tempered by judicious\r\nhumanity. It pays not to be harsh and cruel. Whether we can fairly credit\r\nhim with disinterested sympathy on grounds of a common human nature, such\r\nas Seneca was preaching, seems to me very doubtful. That he regarded\r\nthe slave as a sort of domesticated animal, cannot so far as I know be\r\ngathered from direct statements, but may be inferred by just implication\r\nfrom his use of the same language in speaking of slaves and other live\r\nstock. Thus we find[1027] the ‘labouring herd,’ and ‘draught-cattle when\r\nthey are putting in a good spell of work.’ So too the steward is to drive\r\nhome his slave-gang at dusk ‘after the fashion[1028] of a first-rate\r\nherdsman,’ and on arrival first of all to attend to their needs ‘like a\r\ncareful shepherd.’ The motive of this care is to keep the staff in good\r\nworking order. Both steward and stewardess are required to pay great\r\nattention to the health of the staff. Not only are there prescriptions\r\ngiven for treatment of ailments and injuries, but the slave really stale\r\nfrom overwork is to have a rest; of course malingering must be checked.\r\nFor the sick there is a special[1029] sick-room, always kept clean and\r\naired, and the general sanitation of the farmstead is strictly enforced.\r\nThis too is dictated by enlightened self-interest, a part of the general\r\nrule[1030] that upkeep is as important as acquisition. The position of\r\nthe female staff of the farm has also a bearing on this subject. They do\r\nnot appear to be numerous, though perhaps proportionally more so than in\r\nthe scheme of Varro. The _vilica_ has a number of maids under her for\r\ndoing the various house-work[1031] and spinning and weaving. We have\r\nalready noted the rewards of fertility on their part. For the production\r\nof home-bred slaves (_vernae_), always a thing welcomed by proprietors,\r\nis most formally recognized by Columella. Why it needed encouragement\r\nmay perhaps receive some illustration from remarks upon the behaviour of\r\ncertain birds in the matter of breeding. Thus peafowl do well in places\r\nwhere they can run at large, and the hens take more pains to rear their\r\nchicks, being so to speak[1032] set free from slavery. And other birds\r\nthere are that will not breed in captivity. The analogy of these cases to\r\nthat of human slaves can hardly have escaped the notice of the writer.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between the slaves who are chained and those who are not\r\nappears the more striking from Columella’s references to the lock-up\r\nchamber or slave-prison. His predecessors pass lightly over this matter,\r\nbut he gives it the fullest recognition. The _ergastulum_ should be a\r\nchamber[1033] below ground level, as healthy as you can get, lighted by\r\na number of slits in the wall so high above the floor as to be out of\r\na man’s reach. This dungeon is only for the refractory slaves, chained\r\nand constantly inspected. For the more submissive ones cabins (_cellae_)\r\nare provided in healthy spots near their work but not so scattered as to\r\nmake observation difficult. There is even a bath house[1034], which the\r\nstaff are allowed to use on holidays only: much bathing is weakening.\r\nWhether on an average farm the chained or unchained slaves are assumed\r\nto be the majority is not quite clear; probably the unchained, to judge\r\nby the general tone of the precepts. But that a lock-up is part of the\r\nnormal establishment is clear enough. And it is to be noted that in one\r\npassage[1035] _ergastula_ are mentioned in ill-omened juxtaposition\r\nwith citizens enslaved by their creditors. Whether it is implied\r\nthat unhappy debtors were still liable to be locked up as slaves in\r\ncreditors’ dungeons as of old, is not easy to say. Columella is capable\r\nof rhetorical flourishes now and then. It is safer to suppose that he is\r\nreferring to two forms of slave-labour; first, the working off arrears of\r\ndebt[1036] by labour of a servile kind; second, the wholesale slave-gang\r\nsystem suggested by the significant word _ergastula_. Or are we to read\r\ninto it a reference to the kidnapping[1037] of wayfarers which Augustus\r\nand Tiberius had striven to put down? Before we leave the subject of\r\nthe slave-staff it is well to note that no prospect of freedom is held\r\nout, at least to the males. Fertility, as we have seen, might lead to\r\nmanumission of females. But we are not told what use they were likely\r\nto make of their freedom, when they had got it. My belief is that they\r\nstayed on the estate as tolerated humble dependants; for they would\r\nhave no other home. Some were natives of the place, and the imported\r\nones would have lost all touch with their native lands. Perhaps the\r\ncare of poultry[1038] is a specimen of the various minor functions in\r\nwhich they could make themselves useful. At all events they were free\r\nfrom fetters and the lash. And the men too may have been occasionally\r\nmanumitted on the same sort of terms. Silence does not prove a negative.\r\nFor instance, we hear of _peculium_, the slave’s quasi-property, only\r\nincidentally[1039] as being derived from _pecus_. Yet we are not entitled\r\nto say that slaves were not free to make savings under the system of\r\nColumella.\r\n\r\nThough the _vilicus_ appears in this treatise as the normal head of\r\nthe management, there are signs that this was not the last word in\r\nestate-organization. That he is sometimes[1040] referred to as being the\r\nlandlord’s agent (_actor_), but usually not, rather suggests that he\r\ncould be, and often was, confined to a more restricted sphere of duty,\r\nnamely the purely agricultural superintendence of the farm in hand. This\r\nwould make him a mere farm-bailiff, directing operations on the land,\r\nbut with little or no responsibility for such matters as finance. And\r\nin a few passages we have mention of a _procurator_. This term must be\r\ntaken in its ordinary sense[1041] as signifying the landlord’s ‘attorney’\r\nor full legal representative. He is to keep an eye on the management,\r\nfor instance[1042] the threshing-floor, if the master is not at hand.\r\nThe position of his quarters indicates his importance: as the steward’s\r\nlodging is to be where he can watch goings-out and comings-in, so that\r\nof the _procurator_ is to be where[1043] he can have a near view of the\r\nsteward as well as doings in general. Judging from the common practice\r\nof the day, it is probable that he would be a freedman. Now, why does\r\nColumella, after referring to him thus early in the treatise, proceed to\r\nignore him afterwards? The only reasonable explanation that occurs to\r\nme is that the appointment of such an official would only be necessary\r\nin exceptional cases: in short, that in speaking of a _procurator_\r\nhe implies an unexpressed reservation ‘supposing such a person to be\r\nemployed.’ Circumstances that might lead to such an appointment are not\r\nfar to seek. The landlord might be abroad for a long time on public\r\nduty or private business. There might be large transactions pending\r\n(purchases, sales, litigation, etc) in connexion with the estate or\r\nneighbourhood; in the case of a very large estate this was not unlikely.\r\nThe estate might be one of several owned by the same lord, and the\r\n_procurator_ intermittently resident on one or other as from time to time\r\nrequired. Or lastly the services of an agent with full legal powers may\r\nhave been desirable in dealing with free tenantry. If a landlord had a\r\nnumber of tenant farmers on his estates, it is most unlikely that his\r\n_vilici_, slaves as they were, would be able to keep a firm hand[1044] on\r\nthem: and the fact of his letting his farms surely suggests that he would\r\nnot desire to have much rent-collecting or exaction of services to do\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nOne point in which Columella’s system seems to record a change from\r\nearlier usage may be found in the comparative disuse of letting out\r\nspecial jobs to contractors. In one passage[1045], when discussing the\r\ntrenching-work required in _pastinatio_, and devices for preventing the\r\ndisputes arising from bad execution of the same, he refers to _conductor_\r\nas well as _dominus_. The interests of the two are liable to clash, and\r\nhe tries to shew a means of ensuring a fair settlement between the\r\nparties without going to law. I understand the _conductor_ to be a man\r\nwho has contracted for the job at an agreed price, and _exactor operis_\r\njust below to be the landlord, whose business it is to get full value for\r\nhis money. Thus _conductor_ here will be the same as the _redemptor_ so\r\noften employed in the scheme of Cato. I cannot find further traces of him\r\nin Columella. Nor is the sale of a hanging[1046] crop or a season’s lambs\r\nto a speculator referred to. But we have other authority for believing\r\nthat contracts of this kind were not obsolete, and it is probable\r\nthat the same is true of contracts for special operations. That such\r\narrangements were nevertheless much rarer than in Cato’s time seems to be\r\na fair inference. The manifest reluctance[1047] to hire external labour\r\nalso points to the desire of getting, so far as possible, all farming\r\noperations performed by the actual farm-staff. If I have rightly judged\r\nthe position of tenant farmers, it is evident that their stipulated\r\nservices would be an important help in enabling the landlord to dispense\r\nwith employment of contractors’ gangs on the farm. This was in itself\r\ndesirable: that the presence of outsiders was unsettling to your own\r\nslaves had long been remarked, and in the more elaborate organization\r\nof Columella’s day disturbing influences would be more apprehensively\r\nregarded than ever.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to follow out all the details of this complicated\r\nsystem and enumerate the various special functions assigned to the\r\nmembers of the staff. To get good foremen even at high prices was one\r\nof the leading principles: an instance[1048] is seen in the case of\r\nvineyards, where we hear of a thoroughly competent _vinitor_, whose price\r\nis reckoned at about £80 of our money, the estimated value of about 4½\r\nacres of land. The main point is that it is a system of slave labour on\r\na large scale, and that Columella, well aware that such labour is in\r\ngeneral wasteful, endeavours to make it remunerative by strict order\r\nand discipline. He knows very well that current lamentations over the\r\nsupposed exhaustion[1049] of the earth’s fertility are mere evasions of\r\nthe true causes of rural decay, neglect and ignorance. He knows that\r\nintensive cultivation[1050] pays well, and cites striking instances. But\r\nthe public for whom he writes is evidently not the men on small holdings,\r\nlargely market-gardeners[1051], who were able to make a living with or\r\nwithout slave-help, at all events when within reach of urban markets.\r\nHe addresses men of wealth, most of whom were proud of their position\r\nas landlords, but presumably not unwilling to make their estates more\r\nremunerative, provided the effort did not give them too much trouble.\r\nThis condition was the real difficulty; and it is hard to believe that\r\nColumella, when insisting on the frequent presence of the master’s eye,\r\nwas sanguine enough to expect a general response. His attitude towards\r\npastoral industry seems decidedly less enthusiastic than that of his\r\npredecessors. Stock[1052] must be kept on the farm, partly to eat off\r\nyour own fodder-crops, but chiefly for the sake of supplying manure for\r\nthe arable land. In quoting Cato’s famous saying on the profitableness\r\nof grazing, he agrees that nothing pays so quickly as good grazing, and\r\nthat moderately good grazing pays well enough. But if, as some versions\r\nhave it, he really said that even bad grazing was the next best thing for\r\na farmer, Columella respectfully dissents. The breeding and fattening of\r\nall manner of animals for luxurious tables[1053] remains much the same as\r\nin the treatise of Varro. A curious caution is given[1054] in discussing\r\nthe fattening of thrushes. They are to be fed with ‘dried figs beaten up\r\nwith fine meal, as much as they can eat or more. Some people chew the\r\nfigs before giving them to the birds. But it is hardly worth while to do\r\nthis if you have a large number to feed, for it costs money to hire[1055]\r\npersons to do the chewing, and the sweet taste makes them swallow a good\r\ndeal themselves.’ Now, why hire labour for such a purpose? Is it because\r\nslaves would swallow so much of the sweet stuff that your thrushes would\r\nnever fatten?\r\n\r\nIt is well known that importation of corn from abroad led to great\r\nchanges in Italian agriculture in the second century BC. The first was\r\nthe formation of great estates worked by slave-gangs, which seems to have\r\nbegun as an attempt to compete with foreign large-scale farming in the\r\ngeneral production of food-stuffs. If so, it was gradually discovered\r\nthat it did not pay to grow cereal crops for the market, unscrupulous\r\nin slave-driving though the master might be. Therefore attention was\r\nturned to the development on a larger scale of the existing culture\r\nof the vine and olive and the keeping of great flocks and herds. Food\r\nfor these last had to be found on the farm in the winter, and more and\r\nmore it became usual only to grow cereals as fodder for the stock,\r\nof course including the slaves. No doubt there was a demand for the\r\nbetter sorts, such as wheat, in all the country towns, but the farms\r\nin their immediate neighbourhood would supply the need. That Columella\r\nassumes produce of this kind to be normally consumed on the place,\r\nis indicated by his recommending[1056] barley as good food for all\r\nlive-stock, and for slaves when mixed with wheat. Also by his treating\r\nthe delicate[1057] white wheat, much fancied in Rome, as a degenerate\r\nvariety, not worth the growing by a practical farmer. His instructions\r\nfor storage shew the same point of view. The structure and principles\r\nof granaries[1058] are discussed at length, and the possibility of\r\nlong storage[1059] is contemplated. The difficulties of transport by\r\nland had certainly been an important influence in the changes of Roman\r\nhusbandry, telling against movements of bulky produce. Hence the value\r\nattached[1060] to situations near the seaboard or a navigable stream\r\n(the latter not a condition often to be realized in Italy) by Columella\r\nand his predecessors. Military roads served the traveller as well as the\r\narmies, but took no regard[1061] of agricultural needs. Moreover they had\r\nspecial[1062] drawbacks. Wayfarers had a knack of pilfering from farms\r\non the route, and someone or other was always turning up to seek lodging\r\nand entertainment. Thus it was wise not to plant your villa close to\r\none of these trunk roads, or your pocket was likely to suffer. But to\r\nhave a decent approach[1063] by a country road was a great convenience,\r\nfacilitating the landlord’s periodical visits and the carriage of goods\r\nto and from the estate.\r\n\r\nCertain words call for brief notice. Thus _opera_, the average day’s\r\nwork of an average worker, is Columella’s regular labour-unit in terms\r\nof which he expresses the labour-cost[1064] of an undertaking. In no\r\nother writer is this more marked. Occasionally _operae_ occurs in the\r\nwell-known concrete sense[1065] of the ‘hands’ themselves. The _magistri_\r\nmentioned are not always the foremen spoken of above, but sometimes[1066]\r\ndirectors or teachers in a general sense or even as a sort of synonym for\r\n_professores_. To recur once again to _colonus_, the word, as in other\r\nwriters, often means simply ‘cultivator,’ not ‘tenant-farmer.’ The latter\r\nspecial sense occurs in a passage[1067] which would be useful evidence\r\nfor the history of farm-tenancies, if it were not doubtful whether the\r\ntext is sound.\r\n\r\nThere remains a question, much more than a merely literary problem, as\r\nto the true relation of Columella to Vergil. That he constantly quotes\r\nthe poet, and cites him as an authority on agriculture, is a striking\r\nfact. One instance will shew the deep veneration with which he regards\r\nthe great master. In speaking[1068] of the attention to local qualities\r\nof climate and soil needed in choosing an estate, he quotes lines\r\nfrom the first _Georgic_, the matter of which is quite traditional,\r\ncommon property. But he speaks of Vergil (to name the poet[1069] was\r\nunnecessary) as a most realistic[1070] bard, to be trusted as an oracle.\r\nNay, so irresistible is to him the influence of Vergil, that he must\r\nneeds cast his own tenth book into hexameter verse: the subject of that\r\nbook is gardens, a topic on which Vergil had confessedly[1071] not fully\r\nsaid his say. And yet in the treatment of the land-question there is a\r\nfundamental difference between the two writers. Columella’s system is\r\nbased on slave labour organized to ensure the completest efficiency:\r\nVergil practically ignores slavery altogether. Columella advises you to\r\nlet land to tenant farmers whenever you cannot effectively superintend\r\nthe working of slave-organizations under stewards: Vergil ignores this\r\nsolution also, and seems vaguely to contemplate a return to the system\r\nof small farms owned and worked by free yeomen in an idealized past.\r\nColumella is concerned to see that capital invested in land is so\r\nemployed as to bring in a good economic return: Vergil dreams of the\r\nrevival of a failing race, and possible economic success and rustic\r\nwellbeing are to him not so much ends as means. The contrast is striking\r\nenough. In the chapter on Vergil I have already pointed out that the poet\r\nhad at once captured the adoration of the Roman world. It was not only in\r\nquotations or allusions, or in the incense of praise, that his supremacy\r\nwas held in evidence so long as Latin literature remained alive. His\r\ninfluence affected prose style also, and subtle reminiscences of\r\nVergilian flavour maybe traced in Tacitus. But all this is very different\r\nfrom the practice of citing him as an authority on a special subject, as\r\nColumella did and the elder Pliny did after him.\r\n\r\nI would venture to connect this practice with the Roman habit of viewing\r\ntheir own literature as inspired by Greek models and so tending to move\r\non parallel lines. Cicero was not content to be a Roman Demosthenes; he\r\nmust needs try to be a Roman Plato too, if not also a Roman Aristotle.\r\nNow citation of the Homeric poems as a recognized authority on all\r\nmanner of subjects, not to mention casual illustrations, runs through\r\nGreek literature. Plato and Aristotle are good instances. It is surely\r\nnot surprising that we find Roman writers patriotically willing to cite\r\ntheir own great poet, more especially as the _Georgics_ lay ready to\r\nhand. In the next generation after Columella, Quintilian framed his\r\ncriticism[1072] of the two literatures (as food for oratorical students)\r\non frankly parallel lines. Vergil is the pair to Homer: second to\r\nthe prince of singers, but a good second: and he is quoted and cited\r\nthroughout the treatise as Homer is in Aristotle’s _Rhetoric_. True, the\r\ncases are not really parallel. Whatever preexistent material may have\r\nserved to build up the Homeric poems, they are at least not didactic\r\npoems, made up of precepts largely derived from technical writers, and\r\nrefined into poetic form with mature and laborious skill. To quote the\r\n_Georgics_, not only for personal observation of facts but for guiding\r\nprecepts, is often to quote a secondary authority in a noble dress, and\r\nserves but for adornment. But in such a consideration there would be\r\nnothing to discourage Roman literary men. To challenge Vergil’s authority\r\non a rustic subject remained the prerogative of Seneca.\r\n\r\n                    Additional note to page 263\r\n\r\n    Varro _de lingua Latina_ VII § 105 says _liber qui suas operas\r\n    in servitutem pro pecunia quadam debebat dum solveret nexus\r\n    vocatur, ut ab aere obaeratus_. This antiquarian note is of\r\n    interest as illustrating the meaning of _operae_, and the\r\n    former position of the debtor as a temporary slave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAGE OF THE FLAVIAN AND ANTONINE EMPERORS\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV. GENERAL INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to find a satisfactory line of division between the\r\nperiod of the Flavian emperors and that of the adoptive series that came\r\nafter them. The Plebeian Flavians had no family claim, through birth or\r\nadoption, to a preeminent position in the Roman world, and the rise of\r\nVespasian to power was indeed a revolution. Henceforth, though outward\r\nforms and machinery remained, the real control of the empire rested with\r\nthose supported directly or indirectly by the great armies. But the\r\nsound administrative policy set going by the common sense of Vespasian\r\nlong maintained the imperial fabric in strength, and it is commonly held\r\nthat from 69 to 180 AD was the Empire’s golden age. Nevertheless its\r\nvitality was already ebbing, and the calamities that beset it in the days\r\nof Marcus Aurelius found it unable to renew its vigour after holding\r\nin check its barbarian invaders. The Flavian-Antonine period must be\r\ntreated as one, and from the point of view of the present inquiry certain\r\nsignificant facts must always be borne in mind. The Italian element\r\nin the armies was becoming less and less. Military policy consisted\r\nchiefly in defence of the frontiers, for the annexations of Trajan were\r\nnot lasting, and they exhausted strength needed for defence. It was an\r\nominous sign that the Roman power of assimilation was failing. Mixed\r\narmies of imperfectly Romanized soldiery, whether as conquerors or as\r\nsettlers, could not spread Roman civilization in the same thorough way as\r\nit had become at length established in Spain or southern Gaul. To spread\r\nit extensively and not intensively meant a weakening of Roman grasp; and\r\nat some points[1073] it seems as if the influx of barbarism was felt\r\nto be a menace in time of peace, not effectively counteracted by the\r\npeaceful penetration of Rome.\r\n\r\nNow, if the protection of Italy by chiefly alien swords was to relieve\r\nthe imperial centre from the heavy blood-tax borne by it in the old days\r\nof Roman expansion, surely it remained an Italian function or duty to\r\nprovide carriers[1074] of Roman civilization, that is, if border lands\r\nwere to be solidly Romanized as a moral bulwark against barbarism. But\r\nthis duty could only be performed by a healthy and vigorous Italy, and\r\nItaly[1075] was not healthy and vigorous. Internal security left the\r\npeople free to go on in the same ways as they had now been following for\r\ngenerations, and those ways, as we have seen, did not tend to the revival\r\nof a free rural population. Country towns were not as yet in manifest\r\ndecay, but there were now no imperial politics, and municipal politics,\r\never petty and self-regarding, offered no stimulus to arouse a larger\r\nand common interest. Municipalities looked for benefactors, and were\r\nstill able to find them. In this period we meet with institutions of a\r\ncharitable kind, some even promoted by the imperial government, for the\r\nbenefit of orphans and children of the poor. This was a credit to the\r\nhumanity of the age, but surely a palliative of social ailments, not a\r\nproof of sound condition. In Rome there was life, but it was cosmopolitan\r\nlife. Rome was the capital of the Roman world, not of Italy. In the\r\neyes of jealous patriots it seemed that what Rome herself needed was a\r\nthorough Romanizing. It was not from the great wicked city, thronged with\r\nadventurers[1076] of every sort, largely Oriental Greeks, and hordes\r\nof freedmen, that the better Roman influences could spread abroad. Nor\r\nwere the old Provinces, such as Spain and southern Gaul, where Roman\r\ncivilization had long been supreme, in a position to assimilate[1077]\r\nand Romanize the ruder border-lands by the Rhine and Danube. They had no\r\nenergies to spare: moreover, they too depended on the central government,\r\nand the seat of that government was Rome.\r\n\r\nItaly alone could have vitalized the empire by moral influence, creating\r\nin the vast fabric a spiritual unity, and making a great machine into\r\nsomething more or less like a nation,—that is, if she had been qualified\r\nfor acting such a part. But Italy had never been a nation herself. The\r\nresult of the great Italian war of 90 and 89 BC had been to merge Italy\r\nin Rome, not Rome in Italy. Italians, now Romans, henceforth shared\r\nthe exploitation of the subject countries and the hatred of oppressed\r\npeoples. But under the constitution of the Republic politics became more\r\nof a farce the more the franchise was extended, and the most obvious\r\neffect of Italian enfranchisement was to increase the number of those\r\nwho directly or indirectly made a living out of provincial wrongs. The\r\nProvinces swarmed with bloodsuckers of every kind. The establishment\r\nof the Empire at length did something to relieve the sufferings of the\r\nProvinces. But it was found necessary to recognize Italy as a privileged\r\nimperial land. In modern times such privilege would take the form of\r\npolitical rights and responsibilities. But political life was dead, and\r\nprivilege could only mean local liberties, exemption from burdens, and\r\nthe like. And in the long run the maintenance or abolition of privilege\r\nwould have to depend on the success or failure of the system. Now the\r\nemperors of the first two centuries of the Empire did their best to\r\nmaintain the privileged position of Italy. But even in the time of\r\nAugustus it was already becoming clear that Romanized Italy depended on\r\nRome and that Rome, so far as the Senate and Magistrates were concerned,\r\ncould not provide for the efficient administration of Italy or even of\r\nRome itself. Then began the long gradual process by which Italy, like\r\nthe rest of the empire, passed more and more under the control of the\r\nimperial machine. In the period we are now considering this was steadily\r\ngoing on, for brief reactions, such as that under Nerva, did not really\r\ncheck it, and Italy was well on the way to become no more than a Province.\r\n\r\nThe feature of this period most important in connexion with the present\r\ninquiry is the evidence[1078] that emperors were as a rule painfully\r\nconscious of Italian decay. Alive to the dangers involved in its\r\ncontinuance, they accepted the responsibility of doing what they could\r\nto arrest it. Their efforts took various forms, chiefly (_a_) the direct\r\nencouragement of farming (_b_) relief of poverty (_c_) measures for\r\nproviding more rural population or preventing emigration of that still\r\nexisting. It is evident that the aim was to place and keep more free\r\nrustics on the land. In the numerous allotments of land to discharged\r\nsoldiers a number of odd pieces[1079] (_subsiciva_), not included in\r\nthe lots assigned, were left over, and had been occupied by squatters.\r\nVespasian, rigidly economical in the face of threatened state-bankruptcy,\r\nhad the titles inquired into, and resumed and sold those pieces where\r\nno valid grant could be shewn. Either this was not fully carried out,\r\nor some squatters must have been allowed to hold on as ‘possessors,’\r\nprobably paying a quit-rent to the treasury. For Domitian[1080] found\r\nsome such people still in occupation and converted their tenure into\r\nproprietorship, on the ground that long possession had established a\r\nprescriptive right. Nerva tried to go further[1081] by buying land and\r\nplanting agricultural colonies: but little or nothing was really effected\r\nin his brief reign. In relief of poverty it was a notable extension to\r\nlook beyond the city of Rome, where corn-doles had long existed, and\r\ncontinued to exist. The plan adopted was for the state to advance money\r\nat low rates of interest to landowners in municipal areas, and to let\r\nthe interest received form a permanent endowment for the benefit of\r\npoor parents and orphans. We must remember that to have children born\r\ndid not imply a legal obligation to rear them, and that the prospect\r\nof help from such funds was a distinct encouragement to do so. Whether\r\nany great results were achieved by this form of charity must remain\r\ndoubtful: flattering assurances[1082] to Trajan on the point can no more\r\nbe accepted without reserve than those addressed to Augustus on the\r\nsuccess of his reforms, or to Domitian on his promotion of morality. But\r\nit seems certain that private charity was stimulated by imperial action,\r\nand that the total sums applied in this manner were very large. Begun by\r\nNerva, carried out[1083] by Trajan, extended by Hadrian and Antoninus\r\nPius, the control of these endowments was more centralized by Marcus. In\r\nhis time great dearth in Italy had made distress more acute, and the hour\r\nwas at hand when the inner disorders of the empire would cause all such\r\npermanent foundations to fail and disappear. They may well have relieved\r\nmany individual cases of indigence, but we can hardly suppose their\r\ngeneral effect on the Italian population to have been a healthy one.\r\nThey must have tended to deaden enterprise and relax self-help, for they\r\nwere too much after the pauperizing model long established in Rome. The\r\nprovision of cheap loan-capital for landowners may or may not have been a\r\nboon in the long run.\r\n\r\nThe increase of rustic population through excess of births over deaths\r\ncould not be realized in a day, even if the measures taken to promote\r\nit were successful. So we find Trajan[1084] not only founding colonies\r\nin Italy but forbidding colonists to be drawn from Italy for settlement\r\nin the Provinces; a restriction said to have been[1085] disregarded by\r\nMarcus. But one important sequel of the frontier wars of Marcus, in which\r\nGerman mercenaries were employed, was the transplanting[1086] of large\r\nnumbers of German captives into Italy. Such removals had occurred before,\r\nbut seldom and on a small scale. This wholesale transplantation under\r\nMarcus made a precedent for many similar movements later on. It may be\r\ntaken for granted that the emperor did not turn out Italians in order to\r\nfind room for the new settlers. It is also probable that these were bound\r\nto military service. The great military colonies of later date, formed\r\nof whole tribes or nations settled near the frontiers, certainly held\r\ntheir lands on military tenure. Such was the system of frontier defence\r\ngradually forced upon Rome through the failure of native imperial forces\r\nsufficient for the purpose: and this failure was first conspicuous in\r\nItaly. Among the various measures taken by emperors to interest more\r\npersons in promoting Italian agriculture we may notice Trajan’s[1087]\r\nordinance, that Provincials who aspired to become Roman Senators must\r\nshew themselves true children of Rome by investing one third of their\r\nproperty in Italian land. The order seems to have been operative, but the\r\nreduction[1088] of the fixed minimum proportion from ⅓ to ¼ by Marcus\r\nlooks as if the first rule had been found too onerous. There is no reason\r\nto think that the state of rural Italy was materially bettered by these\r\nwell-meant efforts. And the introduction of barbarian settlers, who had\r\nto be kept bound to the soil in order to be readily available when needed\r\nfor military service, tended to give the rustic population a more and\r\nmore stationary character. It was in fact becoming more usual to let\r\nfarms to free _coloni_; but the _coloni_, though personally free, were\r\nlosing freedom of movement.\r\n\r\n                  NOTE ON EMIGRATION FROM ITALY.\r\n\r\n    In the _Journal of Roman Studies_ (vol VIII) I have discussed\r\n    the question whether the emigration from Italy to the Provinces\r\n    was to a serious extent agricultural in character, and in\r\n    particular whether we can believe it to have carried abroad\r\n    real working rustics in large numbers. Are we to see in it\r\n    an important effective cause of the falling-off of the free\r\n    rustic population of Italy? That the volume of emigration\r\n    was large may be freely granted; also that settlements of\r\n    discharged soldiers took place from time to time. Nor does it\r\n    seem doubtful that many of the emigrants became possessors\r\n    of farm-lands[1089] in the Provinces. But that such persons\r\n    were working rustics, depending on their own labour, is by\r\n    no means clear. And, if they were not, the fact of their\r\n    holding land abroad does not bear directly on the decay of\r\n    the working farmer class in Italy. That commerce and finance\r\n    and exploitation in general were the main occupations of\r\n    Italian[1090] emigrants, I do not think can be seriously\r\n    doubted. And that many of them combined landholding with their\r\n    other enterprises is probable enough.\r\n\r\n    Professor Reid kindly reminds me that soldiers from Italy,\r\n    whose term of service expired while they were still in a\r\n    Province, were apt to settle down there in considerable\r\n    numbers. The case of Carteia in Spain is well known, and that\r\n    of Avido, also in Spain, was probably of the same nature. These\r\n    were not regular Colonies. So too in Africa Marius seems to\r\n    have left behind him communities of soldiers not regularly\r\n    organized[1091] as _coloniae_. When the town of Uchi Maius\r\n    received the title of _colonia_ from the emperor Severus, it\r\n    called itself[1092] _colonia Mariana_, like the one founded by\r\n    Marius in Corsica. And the same title appears in the case[1093]\r\n    of Thibari. With these African settlements we may connect the\r\n    law carried by Saturninus in 100 BC to provide the veterans\r\n    of Marius with allotments of land in Africa, on the scale\r\n    of 100 _iugera_ for each man. If this record[1094] is to be\r\n    trusted (and the doubtful points cannot be discussed here), the\r\n    natural inference is that farms of considerable size are meant,\r\n    for the working of which no small amount of labour would be\r\n    required. Nor is this surprising, for the soldiers of Marius\r\n    were at the time masters of the situation, and not likely to\r\n    be content with small grants. Whether the allotments proposed\r\n    were in Africa or in Cisalpine Gaul[1095] is not quite certain.\r\n    Marius seems to have left Africa in the winter of 105-4 BC.\r\n    Since then he had been engaged in the war with the northern\r\n    barbarians, and the lands recovered from the invaders were in\r\n    question. Still, the proposal may have referred to Africa, for\r\n    it is certain that the connexion of Marius with that Province\r\n    was remembered[1096] long after. The important point is that\r\n    the persons to be gratified were not civilian peasants but\r\n    discharged veterans of the New Model army, professionalized by\r\n    Marius himself. Neither the retired professional mercenaries of\r\n    Greco-Macedonian armies, nor the military colonists of Sulla,\r\n    give us reason to believe that such men would regard hard and\r\n    monotonous labour with their own hands as a suitable reward\r\n    for the toils and perils of their years of military service.\r\n    Surely they looked forward to a life of comparative ease, with\r\n    slaves to labour under their orders. If they kept their hold on\r\n    their farms, they would become persons of some importance in\r\n    their own provincial neighbourhood. Such were the _milites_ or\r\n    _veterani_ whom we find often mentioned under the later Empire:\r\n    and these too were evidently not labourers but landlords and\r\n    directors.\r\n\r\n    Therefore I hold that the class of men, many of them Italians\r\n    by descent, whom we find holding land in various Provinces\r\n    and living on the profits of the same, were mostly if not all\r\n    either soldier-settlers or persons to whom landholding was one\r\n    of several enterprises of exploitation. That the mere Italian\r\n    peasant emigrated in such numbers as seriously to promote the\r\n    falling-off of the free rustic population of Italy, is a thesis\r\n    that I cannot consider as proved or probable.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV. MUSONIUS.\r\n\r\nIn earlier chapters I have found it necessary to examine the views of\r\nphilosophers on the subject of agriculture and agricultural labour,\r\nholding it important to note the attitude of great thinkers towards\r\nthese matters. And indeed a good deal is to be gleaned from Plato and\r\nAristotle. Free speculations on the nature of the State included not\r\nonly strictly political inquiries, but social and economic also. But in\r\nthe Macedonian period, when Greek states no longer enjoyed unrestricted\r\nfreedom of movement and policy, a change came over philosophy. The\r\ntendency of the schools that now shewed most vital energy, such as the\r\nEpicurean and Stoic, was to concern themselves with the Individual\r\nrather than the State. The nature of Man, and his possibilities of\r\nhappiness, became more and more engrossing topics. As the political\r\nconditions under which men had to live were now manifestly imposed\r\nby circumstances over which the ordinary citizen had no control, the\r\nhappiness of the Individual could no longer be dependent on success in\r\npolitical ambitions and the free play of civic life. It had to be sought\r\nin himself, independent of circumstances. The result was that bold\r\nquestioning and the search for truth ceased to be the prime function\r\nof philosophic schools, and the formation of character took the first\r\nplace. Hence the elaboration of systems meant to regulate a man’s life\r\nby implanting in him a fixed conception of the world in which he had\r\nto live, and his relation to the great universe of which he and his\r\nimmediate surroundings formed a part. And this implied a movement which\r\nmay be roughly described as from questioning to dogma. The teacher became\r\nmore of a preacher, his disciples more of a congregation of the faithful;\r\nand more and more the efficiency of his ministrations came to depend on\r\nhis own personal influence, which we often call magnetism.\r\n\r\nWhen Greek literature and thought became firmly established in Rome\r\nduring the second century BC, it was just this dogmatic treatment\r\nof moral questions that gave philosophy a hold on a people far more\r\ninterested in conduct than in speculation. The Roman attempts, often\r\nclumsy enough, to translate principle into practice were, and continued\r\nto be, various in spirit and success. Stoicism in particular blended\r\nmost readily with the harder and more virile types of Roman character,\r\nand found a peculiarly sympathetic reception among eminent lawyers. The\r\nreigns of the first emperors were not favourable to moral philosophy;\r\nbut the accession of Nero set literature, and with it moralizing, in\r\nmotion once more. A kind of eclectic Stoicism came into fashion, a\r\nRoman product, of which Seneca was the chief representative. A touch\r\nof timeserving was needed to adapt Greek theories for practical use in\r\nthe world of imperial Rome. Seneca was both a courtier and a wealthy\r\nlandowner, and was one of the victims of Nero’s tyranny. We have seen\r\nthat while preaching Stoic doctrine, for instance on the relations of\r\nmaster and slave, he shews little interest in agriculture for its own\r\nsake or in the conditions of agricultural labour. It is interesting\r\nto contrast with his attitude that of another Stoic, a man of more\r\nuncompromising and consistent type, whose life was partly contemporaneous\r\nwith that of Seneca, and who wrote only a few years later under the\r\nFlavian emperors.\r\n\r\n=Musonius[1097] Rufus=, already a teacher of repute in Nero’s time,\r\nseems to have kept himself clear of conspiracies and intrigues,\r\nrecognizing the necessity of the monarchy and devoting himself to his\r\nprofession of moral guide to young men. But any great reputation was\r\ndangerous in Nero’s later years, and a pretext was found for banishing\r\nthe philosopher in 65. Under Galba he returned to Rome, still convinced\r\nof the efficacy of moral suasion, witnessed the bloody successions of\r\nemperors in 69, and risked his life in an ill-timed effort to stay the\r\nadvance of Vespasian’s soldiery by discoursing on the blessings of peace.\r\nVespasian seems to have allowed him to remain in Rome, and he is said to\r\nhave been tutor to Titus. Yet he had not shrunk from bringing to justice\r\nan informer guilty of the judicial murder of a brother Stoic, and he was\r\ngenerally regarded as the noblest of Roman teachers, both in principles\r\nand in practice. He has been spoken of as a forerunner of Epictetus and\r\nMarcus Aurelius. Evidently no timeserver, he seems to have made allowance\r\nfor human needs and human weakness in the application of strict moral\r\nrules. It is a great pity that we have no complete authentic works of\r\nhis surviving: but some of the reports by a pupil or pupils have come\r\ndown to us. One of these extracts[1098] is so complete in itself, and so\r\nstriking in its view of agriculture and agricultural labour, that I have\r\ntranslated it here. We are to bear in mind that the opinions expressed\r\nin it belong to a time when a small number of great landlords owned a\r\nlarge part (and that the most attractive) of Italy, and vast estates\r\nin the provinces as well. It is the luxurious and slave-ridden world\r\nof Petronius and Seneca that we must keep before us in considering the\r\nadvice of Musonius; advice which we cannot simply ignore, however much we\r\nmay see in this good man a voice crying in the wilderness.\r\n\r\n‘There is also another resource[1099], nowise inferior to the above, one\r\nthat might reasonably be deemed superior to it, at least for a man of\r\nstrong body: I mean that derived from the land, whether the farmer owns\r\nit or not. For we see that there are many who, though cultivating land\r\nowned by the state[1100] or by other persons, are yet able to support\r\nnot only themselves but wives and children; while there are some who by\r\nthe devoted industry of their own hands[1101] attain to great abundance\r\nin this way of life. For the earth responds most fairly and justly to\r\nthe care bestowed upon her, returning manifold what she receives and\r\nproviding a plenty of all things necessary to life for him that will\r\nlabour; and she does it consistently with a man’s self-respect and\r\ndignity. For nobody, other than an effeminate weakling, would describe\r\nany of the operations of husbandry as disgraceful or incompatible with\r\nmanly excellence. Are not planting ploughing vine-dressing honourable\r\nworks? And sowing reaping threshing, are not these all liberal pursuits,\r\nsuited to good men? Nay, the shepherd’s life, if it did not degrade\r\nHesiod or hinder him from winning divine favour and poetic renown,\r\nneither will it hinder others. For my part, I hold this to be the best\r\nof all the tasks comprised in husbandry, inasmuch as it affords the\r\nsoul more leisure for pondering and investigating what concerns mental\r\nculture. For all tasks that bend the body and keep it fully on the strain\r\ndo at the same time force the soul to give them its whole attention, or\r\nnearly so, sharing as it does the strain of the body: but all those that\r\npermit the body to escape excessive strain do not prevent the soul from\r\nreasoning out important questions and from improving its own wisdom by\r\nsuch reasonings, a result which is the special aim of every philosopher.\r\nThis is why I set such special value on the art of shepherds. If however\r\na man does[1102] combine tillage with philosophy, I hold no other life\r\ncomparable with this, and no other means of livelihood preferable to\r\nit. Surely it is more according to nature to get your sustenance from\r\nEarth, our nurse and mother, than from some other source. Surely it\r\nis more manly[1103] to live on a farm than to sit idle in a city.\r\nSurely out-of-door pursuits are healthier than sheltered retirement.\r\nWhich, pray, is the freeman’s choice, to meet his needs by receiving\r\nfrom others, or by contrivance of his own? Why, it is thought far more\r\ndignified to be able to satisfy your own requirements unaided than with\r\naid of others. So true is it that to live by husbandry, of course with\r\ndue respect[1104] to what is good and honourable, is beautiful and\r\nconducive to happiness and divine favour. Hence it was that the god\r\n(Delphic Apollo) proclaimed[1105] that Myson of Chenae was a wise man\r\nand greeted Aglaus of Psophis as a happy one; for these both led rustic\r\nlives, working with their own hands and not spending their time in\r\ncities. Surely then it is a worthy ambition to follow these men’s example\r\nand devote ourselves to husbandry in earnest.\r\n\r\n‘Some may think it a monstrous notion that a man of educative power,\r\nqualified to lead youths on to philosophy, should till the soil and do\r\nbodily labour like a rustic. And, if it had been the fact that tilling\r\nthe soil hinders the pursuit of philosophy or the lending help to others\r\nin that pursuit, the notion would have been monstrous indeed. But, as\r\nthings are, if young men could see their teacher at work in the country,\r\ndemonstrating in practice the principle to which reason guides us, namely\r\nthat bodily toil and suffering are preferable to dependence on others\r\nfor our food, I think it would be more helpful to them than attendance\r\nat his lectures in town. What is to hinder the pupil, while he works\r\nat his teacher’s side, from catching his utterances on self-control or\r\njustice or fortitude? For the right pursuit of philosophy is not promoted\r\nby much talking, and young men are under no necessity to learn off the\r\nmass of speculation on these topics, an accomplishment of which the\r\nProfessors[1106] are so vain. For such discourses are indeed sufficient\r\nto use up a man’s lifetime: but it is possible to pick up the most\r\nindispensable and useful points even when one is engaged in the work\r\nof husbandry, especially as the work will not be unceasing but admits\r\nperiods of rest. Now I am well aware that few will be willing to receive\r\ninstruction by this method: but it is better that the majority of youths\r\nwho profess the pursuit of philosophy should never attend a philosopher\r\nat all, I mean those unsound effeminate creatures whose presence at\r\nthe classes is a stain upon the name of philosophy. For of those that\r\nhave a genuine love of philosophy not one would be unwilling to spend\r\nhis time with a good man on a farm, aye though that farm were one most\r\ndifficult[1107] to work; seeing that he would reap great advantages\r\nfrom this employment. He would have the company of his teacher night\r\nand day; he would be removed from the evils of city life, which are a\r\nstumbling-block to the pursuit of philosophy; his conduct, good or bad,\r\ncould not escape notice (and nothing benefits a pupil more than this);\r\nmoreover, to be under the eye of a good man when eating and drinking and\r\nsleeping is a great benefit.’\r\n\r\nAt this point the writer digresses for a moment to quote some lines of\r\nTheognis and to interpret them in a sense favourable to his own views.\r\nHe then continues ‘And let no one say that husbandry is a hindrance to\r\nlearning or teaching. Surely it is not so, if we reflect that under these\r\nconditions the pupil enjoys most fully the company of his teacher while\r\nthe teacher has the fullest control of his pupil. Such then being the\r\nstate of the case, it is clear that of the philosopher’s resources none\r\nis more useful or more becoming than that drawn from husbandry.’\r\n\r\nIn this extract three points simply stand for principles dear to all\r\nsincere Stoics; (1) the duty and benefit of living ‘according to\r\nNature,’ (2) the duty and benefit of self-sufficiency and not depending\r\non the support of others, (3) the duty and satisfaction of continued\r\nself-improvement. Consistent practice on these lines would go far to\r\nproduce the Stoic ideal, the Wise Man, happy and perfect in his assurance\r\nand dignity. But the attempt to combine all these in a ‘back to the land’\r\nscheme of moral betterment has surely in it a marked personal note. It is\r\nthe dream of a singular man in the surroundings of a rotten civilization;\r\na civilization more rotten, and a dream more utopian, than the dreamer\r\ncould possibly know. Aspirations towards a healthy outdoor life had been\r\nfelt by many before Musonius. Admiration of rustic pursuits was no new\r\nthing, but it was generally freedom from worries, with the occasional\r\ndiversions of the chase, that were attractive to the town-bred man.\r\nPloughing and digging, and the responsible charge of flocks and herds,\r\nhad long been almost entirely left to slaves, and Musonius is driven to\r\nconfess that few youths of the class from which he drew pupils would\r\nbe willing to undertake such occupations. It was useless to urge that\r\nbodily labour is not degrading: that it is exhausting, and engrosses the\r\nwhole attention, he could not deny. He falls back on pastoral duties as\r\nlight and allowing leisure for serious discourse. The suggestion seems\r\nunreal, though sincere, when we remember that Italian shepherds had to\r\nfight wolves and brigands. Moreover, the preference of grazing to tillage\r\nwas in no small degree due to the fewer persons employed in it, and the\r\nstockmen were a notoriously rough class. Even the idealized shepherds\r\nof the bucolic poets exhibit a coarseness not congenial to conversation\r\nsavouring of virtue. But to a Stoic preacher who could try to pacify a\r\nlicentious soldiery the notion of using pastoral pursuits as a means to\r\nmoral excellence may well have seemed a reasonable proposal.\r\n\r\nIt is at least clear that the futility of philosophy as administered\r\nby lecturers in Rome had made a strong impression on Musonius. The\r\nfashionable company to whom the discourses were addressed, whether they\r\nfor the moment shed some of their self-satisfaction or not, were seldom\r\nor never induced to remodel their worthless lives. So Musonius urges them\r\nto break away from solemn trifling and take to rustic labour. He probably\r\nchose this remedy as one specially Roman, following the tradition of\r\nthe heroes of ancient Rome. But no artificial revival of this kind was\r\npossible, whatever his generous optimism might say. His contemporary the\r\nelder Pliny, who was content to glorify the vanished past and deplore\r\nthe present, had a truer appreciation of the facts. Farm-work as a\r\nmeans of bringing personal influence to bear, treating body and mind\r\ntogether, a sort of ‘Wisdom while you dig,’ was in such a society a\r\nmerely fantastic proposal. The importance of farming and food-production\r\nwas a commonplace, but the vocation of Musonius was moralizing and\r\ncharacter-production. There is no reason to think that he had any\r\npractical knowledge of agriculture. His austere life proves nothing of\r\nthe kind. The only remark that shews acquaintance with conditions of\r\nlandholding is his reference to the farmers who make a living on hired\r\nland. And this is in too general terms to have any historical value.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI. PLINY THE ELDER.\r\n\r\nAmong the writers of this period who refer to agricultural matters the\r\nmost important is the =elder Pliny=, who contrived in a life of public\r\nservice[1108] in various departments to amass a prodigious quantity of\r\nmiscellaneous learning and to write many erudite works. His _naturalis\r\nhistoria_, an extraordinary compilation of encyclopaedic scope, contains\r\nnumerous references to agriculture, particularly in the eighteenth book.\r\nHe collected and repeated the gleanings from his omnivorous reading,\r\nand the result is more remarkable for variety and bulk than for choice\r\nand digestion. As a recorder he is helpful, preserving as he does a\r\nvast number of details, some not otherwise preserved, others of use in\r\nchecking or supplementing other versions. Far removed as the book is\r\nfrom being a smooth and readable literary work, the moralizing rhetoric\r\nof the age shews its influence not only in the constant effort to wring\r\na lesson of some kind out of the topic of the moment, but in the longer\r\nsermonizing passages that lead up to some subject on which the writer\r\nfeels deeply. One of these[1109] occurs in introducing agriculture,\r\nand in pursuing the subject he loses no opportunity of contrasting a\r\ndegenerate present with a better past. We need not take his lamentations\r\nat their full face-value, but that they were in the main justified is\r\nnot open to doubt. It has been so often necessary to cite him in earlier\r\nchapters, that we shall not have to dwell upon him at great length here.\r\n\r\nThe functions of compiler and antiquarian are apt to coincide very\r\nclosely, and it is in his picture of the earlier conditions of Roman\r\nand Italian farming that Pliny’s evidence is most interesting. The\r\nold traditions[1110] of the simple and manly yeomen, each tilling his\r\nown little plot of ground, content with his seven _iugera_ of land or\r\neven with two in the earliest times, Cincinnatus and the rest of the\r\nfarmer-heroes, to whom their native soil, proud of her noble sons,\r\nresponded[1111] with a bounteous fertility that she denies to the\r\nheartless labour of slave-gangs on modern _latifundia_,—these are the\r\ntopics on which he enlarges with a rhetorical or even poetic warmth.\r\nThe ruin of Italy, nay of Provinces too, through the land-grabbing and\r\nformation of vast estates, is denounced[1112] in a classic passage. He\r\nsees no end to the process. Six landlords held between them half the\r\nProvince of Africa in the time of Nero. Wanting money, the emperor put\r\nthem to death for the sake of their property. He does not add, but\r\ndoubtless reflected, that such measures only added to the resources\r\ncontrolled by a tyrant ruler, not a desirable object. We may add further\r\nthat such iniquities inevitably disposed virtuous emperors to leave the\r\nland-monopolizers a free hand, perhaps unwillingly; but these gentry\r\nwere not breaking the law by buying land, and an emperor conscious\r\nof the burden of administration, and desiring to carry on his work\r\nundisturbed by internal disloyalty, had strong reasons for not provoking\r\nwealthy capitalists. To conciliate them, and if possible to engage their\r\ncooperation in schemes designed for the public good according to the\r\nideas of the time, was to proceed on the line of least resistance.\r\n\r\nAmong the traditional precepts handed on by Pliny from Cato and\r\nothers are many with which we are already familiar. Such is the rule\r\nof Regulus[1113], that in buying a farm regard must be had to the\r\nhealthiness of the situation as well as to the richness of the soil.\r\nAnother is the need of keeping a due proportion[1114] between farm-house\r\nand farm. Great men of the late Republic, Lucullus and Scaevola, erred\r\non this point in opposite directions: Marius on the other hand laid out\r\na _villa_ so skilfully that Sulla said ‘here was a man at last with\r\neyes in his head.’ The value of the master’s eye is another old friend.\r\nWe have also seen above that Mago’s[1115] advice, when you buy a farm,\r\nto sell your town house, was not a policy to be followed by Romans of\r\nquality, who felt it a duty not to cut themselves off from touch with\r\npublic affairs. Another tradition is that of the sentiment of the olden\r\ntime, holding it criminal[1116] to slay man’s fellow-worker, the ox. In\r\nreferring to the technical skill required in a steward, a favourite topic\r\nof Cato, Pliny gives his own view[1117] briefly, ‘the master ought to set\r\nthe greatest store by his steward, but the fellow should not be aware of\r\nit.’ The calculation of labour-cost[1118] in terms of _operae_, as with\r\nothers, so with him, is a regular way of reckoning. And we meet once more\r\nthe saying that, while good cultivation is necessary, too high farming\r\ndoes not pay. He illustrates this by an instance[1119] of comparatively\r\nmodern date. A man of very humble origin, who rose through military\r\nmerit to the consulship, was rewarded by Augustus with a large sum of\r\nmoney: this he spent on buying land[1120] in Picenum and fancy-farming.\r\nIn this course he ran through his property, and his heir did not think\r\nit worth his while to claim the succession. The general tendency of all\r\nthese precepts and anecdotes is to commend moderation and to rebuke the\r\nfoolish ambition of land-proud capitalists of his own day. His praise of\r\nthe ancient ways and regret for their disappearance do not suggest any\r\nhope of their revival. To Pliny as to others it was only too clear that\r\nlegends of conquering consuls setting their own hands to the plough had\r\nno practical bearing on the conditions of the present age.\r\n\r\nThoughtful men[1121] could not ignore the fact that the decline in\r\nproduction of cereal crops left Italy exposed to risk of famine. At any\r\nmoment storms might wreck the corn-fleets from Egypt or Africa, and the\r\nstrategic value of Egypt[1122] as a vital food-centre had been shewn\r\nquite recently in strengthening the cause of Vespasian. No wonder Pliny\r\nis uneasy, and looks back regretfully[1123] to the time when Italy was\r\nnot fed by the Provinces, when thrifty citizens grew their own staple\r\nfood-stuffs, and corn was plentiful and cheap. He quotes some prices from\r\nthe time of the great Punic wars and earlier, which shew the remarkable\r\ncheapness of wine oil dried figs and flesh, as well as of various\r\ngrains. This result was not due to great estates owned by individual\r\nlandlords[1124] who elbowed out their neighbours, but to the willing work\r\nof noble citizens tilling their little holdings. To look for similar\r\nreturns from the task-work of chained and branded slaves is a sheer libel\r\non Mother Earth. That he treats at great length of agricultural details,\r\nnot only of grain-crops in their various kinds, but fruits, vegetables,\r\nindeed everything he can think of, and all the processes of cultivation,\r\nis due to his encyclopaedic bent, and need not detain us here. When he\r\ntells us[1125] that vine-growing was a comparatively late development\r\namong the Romans, who long were content with grain-growing, it is a\r\npassing sigh over a vanished age of simple life. The meaning of words\r\nchanges and records the change of things. When the Twelve Tables[1126]\r\nspoke of _hortus_, it was not a garden in the modern sense, a place of\r\npleasure and luxury, that was meant, but a poor man’s small holding. By\r\nthat venerable code it was made a criminal offence[1127] to cut or graze\r\noff under cover of night the crops raised on a man’s plough-land. A man\r\nwhose farm was badly cultivated was disgraced by the censors. For, as\r\nCato[1128] said, there is no life like the farmer’s for breeding sturdy\r\nmen to make efficient soldiers and loyal citizens. The gist of these\r\nutterances, picked out of the mass, is that Pliny would like to see Italy\r\nable to provide for her own feeding and her own defence, but knows very\r\nwell that no such ideal is within the range of hope.\r\n\r\nHis interest in agriculture such as he saw it around him is shewn in\r\nrecording recent or contemporary doings, such as that of the man\r\nmentioned above who squandered a fortune on ill-judged farming. A more\r\nsuccessful venture[1129] was that of Remmius Palaemon, apparently in the\r\ntime of Claudius. He was a freedman, not a farmer, but a school-master\r\n(_grammaticus_) of repute, a vainglorious fellow. He bought some land,\r\nnot of the best quality and let down by bad farming. To farm this he\r\nengaged another freedman, one Acilius Sthenelus, who had the vineyards\r\nthoroughly overhauled (_pastinatis de integro_). Before eight years\r\nwere out, he was able to sell a hanging crop for half as much again as\r\nit had cost him to buy the land, and within ten years he sold the land\r\nitself to Seneca (not a man for fancy prices) for four times as much as\r\nhe had given for it. Truly a fine speculation. Sthenelus had carried out\r\nanother of the same kind[1130] on his own account. We must note that both\r\nwere in the vine-culture, not in corn-growing, and the appearance of\r\nfreedmen, probably oriental Greeks, as leaders of agricultural enterprise\r\nin Italy. There is nothing to shew that these undertakings were on a\r\nlarge scale: the land in Sthenelus’ own case is stated as not more than\r\n60 _iugera_. But no doubt he was, like many of his tribe, a keen man of\r\nbusiness[1131] and not too proud or preoccupied to give close attention\r\nto the matter in hand. Such a man would get the utmost out of his slaves\r\nand check waste: he would keep a tight grip on a slave steward if (which\r\nwe are not told) he found it necessary to employ one at all. For Pliny,\r\nas for most Romans, a profitable speculation had great charms. He cannot\r\nresist repeating the old Greek story[1132] of the sage who demonstrated\r\nhis practical wisdom by making a ‘corner’ in olive-presses, foreseeing a\r\n‘bumper’ crop. Only he turns it round, making it a ‘corner’ in oil, in\r\nview of a poor crop and high prices, and tells it not of Thales but of\r\nDemocritus.\r\n\r\nThere were of course many principles of agriculture that no economic\r\nor social changes could affect. The ‘oracle’ of Cato, as to the\r\nimportance[1133] of thorough and repeated ploughing followed by liberal\r\nmanuring, was true under all conditions. But just for a moment the veil\r\nis lifted to remind us that in the upland districts there was still an\r\nItaly agriculturally, as socially, very different from the lowland arable\r\nof which we generally think when speaking of Italian farming. ‘Ploughing\r\non hillsides[1134] is cross-wise, and so toilsome to man that he even\r\nhas to do ox-team’s work: at least the mountain peoples[1135] use the\r\nmattock for tillage instead of the plough, and do without the ox.’ It\r\nis to be regretted that we have so little evidence as to the condition\r\nof the dalesmen, other than the passages of such writers as Horace and\r\nJuvenal, who refer to them as rustic folk a sojourn among whom is a\r\nrefreshing experience after the noise and bustle of Rome. For it seems\r\ncertain that in these upland retreats there survived whatever was left of\r\ngenuine Italian life, and we should like to be able to form some notion\r\nof its quantity; that is, whether the population of freemen on small\r\nholdings, living mostly on the produce of their own land, was numerically\r\nan important element in the total population of Italy. That great\r\nstretches of hill-forest were in regular use simply as summer pastures,\r\nand that the bulk of the arable lands were held in great estates, and\r\nslaves employed in both departments, we hear in wearisome iteration. But\r\nto get a true picture of the country as a whole is, in the absence of\r\nstatistics, not possible.\r\n\r\nI have not been able to discover in Pliny any definite repugnance\r\nto slavery as a system. It is true that he is alive to the evils of\r\nthe domestic slavery prevalent in his day. The brigades of slaves\r\n(_mancipiorum legiones_)[1136] filling the mansions of the rich,\r\npilfering at every turn, so that nothing is safe unless put under lock\r\nand seal, are a nuisance and a demoralizing influence. They are an alien\r\nthrong (_turba externa_) in a Roman household; a sad contrast[1137] to\r\nthe olden time, when each family had its one slave, attached to his\r\nmaster’s clan, when the whole household lived in common, and nothing had\r\nto be locked up. But this is only one of Pliny’s moralizing outbreaks,\r\nand it is the abuse and overgrowth of slavery, not slavery in itself,\r\nthat he is denouncing. In speaking of agriculture he says ‘to have\r\nfarms cultivated by slave-gangs[1138] is a most evil thing, as indeed\r\nare all acts performed by those who have no hope.’ Here the comparative\r\ninefficiency of workers who see no prospect of bettering their condition\r\nis plainly recognized; but it is the economic defect, not the outrage\r\non a common humanity, that inspires the consciously futile protest. And\r\nat the very end of his great book, when he breaks out into a farewell\r\npanegyric[1139] on Italy, and enumerates the various elements of her\r\npreeminence among the countries of the world, he includes the supply of\r\nslave-labour[1140] in the list. Spain perhaps comes next, but here too\r\nthe organized employment[1141] of slaves is one of the facts that are\r\nadduced to justify her praise. Now I do not imagine that Pliny was a\r\nhard unkindly man. But he evidently accepted slavery as an established\r\ninstitution, one of the economic bases of society. He saw its\r\ninferiority to free labour, but a passing protest seemed to him enough.\r\nHad he been asked, Why don’t you recommend free labour directly? I think\r\nhe would have answered, Where are you going to find it in any quantity?\r\nAnd it is obvious that, slave labour once assumed, the great thing was\r\nto have enough of it. Nor again have I found him using _colonus_ in\r\nthe sense of tenant farmer. In that of ‘cultivator’ it occurs several\r\ntimes, as in the quotation[1142] from Cato, that to call a man _bonum\r\ncolonum_ was of old the height of praise. Figuratively it appears in\r\ncomparisons, as when the guilt of the slayer of an ox is emphasized[1143]\r\nby the addition ‘as if he had made away with his _colonus_.’ So of the\r\nfertilizing Nile he says ‘discharging the duty[1144] of a _colonus_.’ In\r\nthe passage where he warns his readers against too high farming[1145] he\r\nremarks ‘There are some crops that it does not pay to gather, unless the\r\nowner is employing his own children or a _colonus_ of his own or hands\r\nthat have on other grounds to be fed—I mean, if you balance the cost\r\nagainst the gain.’ Here it is just possible that he means ‘a tenant of\r\nhis own,’ that is a tenant long attached to the estate, like the _coloni\r\nindigenae_ of Columella: but I think it is quite neutral, and probably\r\nhe has in mind either a relative or a slave. The ‘persons for whose keep\r\nhe is responsible’ sums up to the effect that if you have mouths to\r\nfill you may as well use their labour, for it will add nothing to your\r\nlabour-bill. So far as I have seen, the difference between ownership and\r\ntenancy is not a point of interest to Pliny.\r\n\r\nIn continuation of what has been said above as to the relations of Vergil\r\nand Columella, it is necessary to discuss briefly the attitude of Pliny\r\ntowards these two writers. The indices to the _Natural History_ at once\r\ndisclose the fact that citations of Vergil[1146] are about six times as\r\nnumerous as those of Columella. Indeed he seldom refers to the latter;\r\nvery often to Varro, even more often to Cato. The frequent references\r\nto Vergil may reasonably be explained as arising from a wish to claim\r\nwhenever possible the moral support of the now recognized chief figure\r\nof Roman literature. This was all the more easy, inasmuch as Vergil’s\r\nprecepts in the _Georgics_[1147] are mostly old or borrowed doctrine\r\ncast into a perfect form. Columella had used them in a like spirit, but\r\nin dealing with the labour-question he faced facts, not only instructing\r\nhis readers in the technical processes of agriculture, but setting forth\r\nthe forms of labour-organization by which those processes were to be\r\ncarried on. Now Pliny records an immense mass of technical detail, but\r\nof labour-organization he says hardly any thing; for his laments over a\r\nvanished past are only of use in relieving his own feelings. And yet the\r\nlabour-question, and the tenancy-question connected therewith, were the\r\ncentral issues of the agricultural problem. It was not the knowledge of\r\ntechnical details that was conspicuously lacking, but the will and means\r\nto apply knowledge already copious. Not what to do, but how to get it\r\ndone, was the question which Columella tried to answer and Pliny, like\r\nVergil, did not really face. It is curious to turn out the eight distinct\r\nreferences to Columella in Pliny. In none of these passages is there a\r\nsingle word of approval, and the general tone of them is indifferent and\r\ngrudging. Sometimes the words seem to suggest that his authority is not\r\nof much weight, or pointedly remark that it stands quite alone. In one\r\nplace[1148] he is flatly accused of ignorance. When we consider that\r\nPliny speaks of Varro with high respect, and positively worships Cato and\r\nVergil, it is clear that there must have been some special reason for\r\nthis unfriendly and half-contemptuous attitude. The work of Columella\r\ndid not deserve such treatment. It evidently held its ground in spite of\r\nsneers, for Palladius in the fourth century cites it repeatedly as one\r\nof the leading authorities. It is not difficult to conjecture possible\r\ncauses for the attitude of Pliny: but none of those that occur to me is\r\nsufficient, even if true, to justify it. I must leave it as one of the\r\nweak points in the _Natural History_.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII. TACITUS.\r\n\r\n=P Cornelius Tacitus=, one of the great figures of Roman literature,\r\npassed through the time of the Flavian emperors, but his activity as a\r\nwriter belonged chiefly to the reign of Trajan. Like most historians,\r\nhe gave his attention to public and imperial affairs, and we get\r\nfrom him very little as to the conditions of labour. Of emperors and\r\ntheir doings evil or good, of the upper classes and their reactionary\r\nsympathies, their intrigues and perils, we hear enough: but of the poor\r\nwage-earners[1149] and slaves hardly anything, for to one who still\r\nregretted the Republic while accepting the Empire, an aristocrat at\r\nheart, the lower orders were of no more importance than they had been to\r\nCicero. Indeed they were now less worthy of notice, as free political\r\nlife had ceased and the city rabble, no longer needed for voting and\r\nrioting, had merely to be fed and amused. A populace of some sort was a\r\nnecessary element in the imperial capital: that it was in fact a mongrel\r\nmob could not be helped, and year by year it became through manumissions\r\nof slaves a mass of more and more cosmopolitan pauperism. The Provinces\r\nand the frontier armies were matters of deep interest, but the wars of\r\nthe succession after Nero only served to exhibit with irresistible stress\r\nthe comparative unimportance of Italy. Tacitus, a Roman of good family,\r\nborn in Italy if not in Rome, dignified and critical by temperament, was\r\nnot the man to follow the fashion of idle and showy rhetoric. He does not\r\nwaste time and effort in vainly deploring the loss of a state of things\r\nthat could not be restored. That the present condition of Italy grieved\r\nhim, we may feel sure. But he viewed all things in a spirit of lofty\r\nresignation. That he was led to contrast the real or assumed virtues of\r\nGerman barbarians with the flagrant vices of Roman life was about the\r\nlimit of his condescension to be a preacher: and it is not necessary to\r\nassume that the pointing of a moral was the sole motive of his tract on\r\nthe land and tribes of Germany.\r\n\r\nI have already referred to the uneasiness of Tiberius as to the\r\nfood-supply[1150] of Rome, dependent on importations of corn which were\r\nliable to be interrupted by foul weather and losses at sea. The risk was\r\nreal enough, and the great artificial harbours constructed at the Tiber\r\nmouth by Claudius and Trajan were chiefly meant to provide accommodation\r\nfor corn-fleets close at hand, with large granaries to store\r\ncargoes[1151] in reserve. The slave rising of 24 AD in south-eastern\r\nItaly, and its suppression, have also been mentioned[1152] above.\r\nThese passages, and a passing reference to the unproductiveness[1153]\r\nof the soil (of Italy) are significant of the inefficiency of Italian\r\nagriculture in the time of Tiberius. But in reporting these matters\r\nTacitus writes as historian, not as a contemporary witness, and enough\r\nhas been said of them above. A curious passage, not yet referred to, is\r\nthat describing the campaign[1154] against money-lenders in 33 AD. A\r\nlaw passed by Julius Caesar in BC 49 with the object of relieving the\r\nfinancial crisis without resorting to a general cancelling of debts,\r\nlong obsolete, was raked up again, and there was widespread alarm, for\r\nmost senators had money out on loan. It seems that some trials and\r\ncondemnations actually took place, and that estates of the guilty were\r\nactually seized and sold for cash under the provisions of a disused\r\nlaw. Further trouble at once followed, for there was a general calling\r\nin of mortgages, while cash was scarce, the proceeds of the late sales\r\nhaving passed into one or other of the state treasuries. Eighteen months\r\ngrace had been granted to enable offending capitalists to arrange their\r\naffairs in conformity with the law. Evidently these gentry were in no\r\nhurry to reinvest their money as it came in, but waited for a fall in\r\nthe price of land, certain to occur as a consequence of dearer money.\r\nIn order to guard against such a result, the Senate had ordered that\r\neach (that is, each paid-off creditor,) should invest ⅔ of his loanable\r\ncapital in Italian real estate, and that each debtor[1155] should repay\r\n⅔ of his debt at once. But the creditors were demanding payment in full,\r\nand it did not look well for the debtors to weaken their own credit\r\n(by practically confessing insolvency). So there was great excitement,\r\nfollowed by uproar in the praetor’s court: and the measures intended\r\nto relieve the crisis—the arrangements for sale and purchase—had just\r\nthe opposite effect. For the capitalists had locked up all their money\r\nwith a view to the (eventual) purchase of land. The quantity of land\r\nthrown on the market sent prices down, and the more encumbered a man was\r\nthe more difficult he found it to dispose of his land (that is, at a\r\nprice that would clear him of debt). Numbers of people were ruined, and\r\nthe situation was only saved by Tiberius, who advanced a great sum of\r\nmoney to be used in loans for three years free of interest, secured in\r\neach case on real estate[1156] of twice the value. Thus confidence was\r\nrestored and private credit gradually revived. But, Tacitus adds, the\r\npurchase of land on the lines of the Senate’s order was never carried\r\nthrough: in such matters it is the way of the world to begin with zeal\r\nand end with indifference.\r\n\r\nIf I have rightly given the sense of this passage, it furnishes some\r\npoints of interest. It sets before us a state of things in which a\r\nnumber of landowners have raised money by mortgaging their real estate,\r\ndisregarding the provisions (whatever they were) of a law practically\r\ndisused. This reminds us that one very general use of Italian land was as\r\na security on which money could at need be raised. It was the only real\r\nsecurity always available, and this inclined people to keep their hold on\r\nit, though as a direct income-producer it seldom gave good returns. No\r\ndoubt they had to pay on their borrowings a higher rate[1157] of interest\r\nthan they got on their capital invested in land. To be forced suddenly\r\nto sell their lands in a glutted market was manifest ruin; for the whole\r\nstrength of their position lay in the justified assumption that the\r\ncapital value of their land in the market exceeded the amount of their\r\nmortgage debts. Otherwise, who would have lent them the money on that\r\nsecurity? We can hardly avoid the suspicion that the frequent use of\r\nland as a pledge may have had something to do with that unsatisfactory\r\ncondition of agriculture on which the evidence of Latin writers has\r\ndriven us to dwell. The mortgagor, once he had got the money advanced,\r\nhad less interest in the landed security: the mortgagee, so long as he\r\ngot his good return on the money lent, was unconcerned to see that his\r\ndebtor’s income was maintained; and that, in taking a mortgage, he had\r\ninsisted on a large margin of security for his capital, is not to be\r\ndoubted. For what purpose these loans were generally contracted, we are\r\nnot told. Those who borrowed money to waste it in extravagance would\r\nsurely have found it more business-like to sell their land outright. The\r\nnumber of those who preferred to keep it, though encumbered on onerous\r\nterms, simply from social pride, cannot have been really large; but they\r\nwould hardly make wise landlords. Probably some men raised money to\r\nemploy it in speculations[1158] that seemed to offer rich returns. So\r\nlong as the empire stood strong, mercantile speculation was far-reaching\r\nand vigorous. But those engaged in this line of business would seldom be\r\nable to find large sums in ready cash at short notice. Hence to them,\r\nas to spendthrifts, the sudden calling in of mortgages was a grave\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe picture of the wily capitalists, hoarding their money till the\r\n‘slump’ in land-values had fully developed, is one of all ‘civilized’\r\npeoples and ages. What is notable on this particular occasion is the\r\nsequel according to Tacitus. Once their design of profiting by their\r\nneighbours’ necessities was checked by the intervention of Tiberius, the\r\ninvestment in real estate was no longer attractive. The Senate’s order\r\nwas not enforced and the money-lenders could, and did, reserve their\r\nready cash for use in some more remunerative form of investment. The\r\nslackness of the Senate may have been partly due to careless neglect, as\r\nthe words seem to suggest. But it may be suspected that some members of\r\nthat body had private reasons for wishing the Order of the House not to\r\nbe seriously enforced. Tacitus remarks that, on the matter being laid\r\nbefore the Fathers, they were thrown into a flutter, since there was\r\nhardly one among them[1159] that had not broken the law. This surely\r\nrefers to the time-honoured trick of Roman senators, who, forbidden\r\nto engage in commerce (and money-lending was closely connected with\r\ncommerce), evaded the restriction in various ways, such as holding\r\nshares in companies or lending through their freedmen as agents. So now,\r\nseeking a high rate of interest on their capital, they did not wish to\r\nlock up any more of it in land. Most of them would already own enough\r\nreal estate for social purposes. From this episode we have some right\r\nto infer that in the period of the early Empire it had already become\r\nclear that very extensive landowning in Italy was an unwise policy for\r\nmen who wanted a large income. Yet the preferential position of Italy had\r\nnot ceased to be a fact; and even in the time of Trajan we have seen an\r\nimperial ordinance bidding new senators from the Provinces to invest ⅓ of\r\ntheir fortunes in Italian land. This might raise prices for the moment,\r\nbut it had nothing directly to do with promoting agriculture. Practical\r\nfarming seems to have been passing more and more into the hands of\r\nhumbler persons, often freedmen, who treated it as a serious business.\r\n\r\nThat the attention of Tacitus had been directed to the methods of\r\ncapitalists in Italy, and therewith to money-lending, landholding, and\r\nslavery, may be gathered from the remarks on these subjects in his\r\n_Germany_. He writes, as Herodotus and others had done before him,\r\ntaking particular notice of customs differing from those prevalent in\r\nhis own surroundings. Thus he notes[1160] the absence of money-lending\r\nat interest. He describes the system of communal ownership of land by\r\nvillage-units, and its periodic redistribution among the members of the\r\ncommunity. The wide stretches of open plains[1161] enable the Germans to\r\nput fresh fields under tillage year by year, leaving the rest in fallow\r\n(no doubt as rough pasture). Intensive culture is unknown. To wring the\r\nutmost out of the soil by the sweat of their brow is not their aim:\r\nthey have no orchards or gardens or fenced paddocks, but are content\r\nto raise a crop of corn. All this is in marked contrast with Italian\r\nconditions. Even to get rid of fallows was an ambition of agriculturists\r\nin Italy, and a rotation-system[1162] had been devised to this end. And,\r\nwhatever may have been the case in prehistoric times, full property in\r\nland had long been established by the Roman Law, and there was in the\r\nItalian land-system no trace of redistribution for short terms of use.\r\nIn treating of slavery, the first point made is its connexion[1163] with\r\nthe inveterate German habit of gambling. Losers will end by staking their\r\nown freedom on a last throw; if this also fails, they will submit to be\r\nfettered and sold. To the Roman this seems a false notion of honour. He\r\nadds that to take advantage of this sort of slave-winning is not approved\r\nby German sentiment: hence the winner combines[1164] scruples with profit\r\nby selling a slave of this class into foreign lands. Other slaves are\r\nnot employed in Roman fashion as an organized staff of domestics. Each\r\nhas a lodging and home of his own: his lord requires of him a fixed\r\nrent[1165] of so much corn or live-stock or clothing, as of a tenant: and\r\nhe renders no service beyond this. House-work is done by a man’s own wife\r\nand family. Slaves are seldom flogged or chained or put to task-work.\r\nThe German may kill his slave, but it will not be as a penalty for\r\ndisobedience, but in a fit of rage. Freedmen are of little more account\r\nthan slaves, and are only of influence at the courts of the kings who\r\nrule some of the tribes. There they rise above the freeborn and noble:\r\nbut in general the inferiority of freedmen serves to mark the superiority\r\nof the freeborn.\r\n\r\nTacitus had held an important official post in Belgic Gaul or one of\r\nthe so-called ‘Germanies’ along the Rhine, and had been at pains to\r\nlearn all he could of the independent barbarians to the East. The Rhine\r\nfrontier was one of the Roman borders that needed most careful watching,\r\nand Roman readers took an uneasy interest in the doings of the warrior\r\ntribes whose numbers, in contrast to their own falling birth-rate, were\r\never renewed and increased by alarming fertility. He was not alone in\r\nperceiving the contrasts between Italian and German institutions and\r\nhabits, or in reading morals therefrom, expressed or implied. Germans had\r\nbeen employed as mercenary soldiers by Julius Caesar, and were destined\r\nto become one of the chief elements of the Roman armies. But in Italy\r\nthey were perhaps more directly known as slaves. We have just seen that\r\nTacitus speaks of a regular selling of slaves over the German border, and\r\nanother passage[1166] incidentally illustrates this fact in a curious\r\nmanner. In the course of his conquest of Britain, Agricola established\r\nmilitary posts on the NW coast over against Ireland. It seems to have\r\nbeen in one of these that a cohort of Usipi were stationed. They had\r\nbeen raised in the Roman Germanies, and apparently sent over in a hurry.\r\nNot liking the service, they killed their officer and the old soldiers\r\nset to train them, seized three vessels, and put to sea. After various\r\nadventures and sufferings in a voyage round the north of Britain, they\r\nfell into the hands of some tribes of northern Germany, who took them for\r\npirates—those that were left of them. Of the fate reserved for some of\r\nthese Tacitus remarks ‘Some were sold as slaves[1167] and, passing from\r\npurchaser to purchaser, eventually reached the Roman bank (of the Rhine),\r\nwhere their extraordinary story aroused much interest.’ Such were the\r\nstrange possibilities in the northern seas and lands where the Roman and\r\nthe German met.\r\n\r\n                  NOTE ON AN AFRICAN INSCRIPTION.\r\n\r\n    It may be convenient to notice here an inscription[1168]\r\n    relative to irrigation in Africa. In all parts of the empire\r\n    subject to drought the supply of water to farmers was a matter\r\n    of importance, as it is in most Mediterranean countries today.\r\n    Good soils, that would otherwise have lain waste, were thus\r\n    turned to account. In the African Provinces much was done to\r\n    meet this need, as the remains of works for storage of water\r\n    clearly testify. The period 69-180 AD seems to have been marked\r\n    by a considerable extension of cultivation in these parts,\r\n    and particularly in southern Numidia, which at that time was\r\n    included in the Province Africa. In this district, between\r\n    Sitifis (Setif) and Trajan’s great city Thamugadi (Timgad),\r\n    lay the commune of Lamasba[1169], the members of which appear\r\n    to have been mainly engaged in agriculture. There has been\r\n    preserved a large portion of a great inscription dealing with\r\n    the water-rights of their several farms. There is nothing to\r\n    suggest that the holders of these plots were tenants under\r\n    great landlords. They seem to be owners, not in the full\r\n    sense of Roman civil law, but on the regular provincial[1170]\r\n    footing, subject to tribute. To determine the shares of the\r\n    several plots in the common water-supply was probably the most\r\n    urgent problem of local politics in this community.\r\n\r\n    The date of the inscription has been placed in the reign of\r\n    Elagabalus; but it is obviously based on earlier conditions\r\n    and not improbably a revision of an earlier scheme. It deals\r\n    with the several plots one by one, fixing the number of\r\n    hours[1171] during which the water is to be turned on to each,\r\n    and making allowance for variation of the supply according to\r\n    the season of the year. A remarkable feature of this elaborate\r\n    scheme is the division of the plots into those below the water\r\n    level into which the water finds its way by natural flow\r\n    (_declives_), and those above water level (_acclives_). To the\r\n    latter it is clear that the water must have been raised by\r\n    mechanical means, and the scale of hours fixed evidently makes\r\n    allowance for the slower delivery accomplished thereby. For\r\n    the ‘descendent’ water was to be left flowing for fewer hours\r\n    than the ‘ascendent.’ As a specimen of the care taken in such\r\n    a community to prevent water-grabbing by unscrupulous members\r\n    this record is a document of high interest. That many others of\r\n    similar purport existed, and have only been lost to us by the\r\n    chances of time, is perhaps no rash guess.\r\n\r\n    The water-leet is called _aqua Claudiana_. The regulations are\r\n    issued by the local senate and people (_decreto ordinis et\r\n    colonorum_), for the place had a local[1172] government. Names\r\n    of 43 possessors remain on the surviving portion of the stone.\r\n    In form they are generally Roman[1173]. It is noted that only\r\n    three of them have a _praenomen_. Of the quality of the men\r\n    it is not easy to infer anything. Some may perhaps have been\r\n    Italians. Whether they, or some of them, were working farmers\r\n    must remain doubtful. At all events they do not seem to belong\r\n    to the class of _coloni_ of whom we shall have to speak below,\r\n    but to be strictly cultivating possessors. What labour they\r\n    employed it is hardly possible to guess.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. FRONTINUS.\r\n\r\n=Sextus Julius Frontinus=, a good specimen of the competent departmental\r\nofficers in the imperial service, was not only a distinguished\r\nmilitary commander but an engineer and a writer of some merit. His\r\nlittle treatise[1174] on the aqueducts of Rome has for us points of\r\ninterest. From it we can form some notion of the importance of the great\r\nwater-works, not only to the city but to the country for some miles\r\nin certain directions. For water-stealing by the illicit tapping of\r\nthe main channels was practised outside as well as within the walls.\r\nLandowners[1175] did it to irrigate their gardens, and the underlings\r\nof the staff (_aquarii_) connived at the fraud: to prevent this abuse\r\nwas one of the troubles of the _curator_. But in certain places water\r\nwas delivered by branch supplies from certain aqueducts. This of course\r\nhad to be duly licensed, and license was only granted when the flow\r\nof water in the particular aqueduct was normally sufficient to allow\r\nthe local privilege without reducing the regular discharge in Rome.\r\nThe municipality of Tibur[1176] seems to have had an old right to a\r\nbranch of the _Anio vetus_. The _aqua Crabra_ had been a spring serving\r\nTusculum[1177], but in recent times the Roman _aquarii_ had led off some\r\nof its water into the _Tepula_, and made illicit profit out of the supply\r\nthus increased in volume. Frontinus himself with the emperor’s approval\r\nredressed the grievance, and the full supply of the _Crabra_ again served\r\nthe Tusculan landlords. The jealous attention given to the water-works\r\nis illustrated by the decrees[1178] of the Senate in the time of the\r\nRepublic and of emperors since, by which grants of water-rights can only\r\nbe made to individuals named in the grant, and do not pass to heirs or\r\nassigns: the water must only be drawn from the reservoir named, and used\r\non the estate for which the license is specifically granted.\r\n\r\nThe office of _curator aquarum_ was manifestly no sinecure. It was\r\nnot merely that constant precautions had to be taken against the\r\nstealing of the water. An immense staff[1179] had to be kept to their\r\nduties, and the cleansing and repair of the channels needed prompt and\r\ncontinuous attention. And it seems that some of the landowners through\r\nwhose estates the aqueducts passed gave much trouble[1180] to the\r\nadministration. Either they erected buildings in the strips of land\r\nreserved as legal margin on each side of a channel, or they planted\r\ntrees there, thus damaging the fabric; or they drove local roads over\r\nit; or again they blocked the access to working parties engaged in the\r\nduties of upkeep. Frontinus quotes decrees of the Senate dealing with\r\nthese abuses and providing penalties for persons guilty of such selfish\r\nand reckless conduct. But to legislate was one thing, to enforce the\r\nlaw was another. Yet the unaccommodating[1181] landlords had no excuse\r\nfor their behaviour. It was not a question of ‘nationalizing’ the side\r\nstrips, though that would have been amply justified in the interests\r\nof the state. But the fact is that the old practice of Republican days\r\nwas extremely tender of private rights. If a landlord made objection to\r\nselling a part of his estate, they took over the whole block and paid\r\nhim for it. Then they marked off the portions required for the service,\r\nand resold the remainder. Thus the state was left unchallenged owner of\r\nthe part retained for public use. But the absence of any legal or moral\r\nclaim has not availed to stop encroachments: the draining away of the\r\nwater still goes on, with or without leave, and even the channels and\r\npipes themselves are pierced. No wonder that more severe and detailed\r\nlegislation was found necessary in the time of Augustus. The writer ends\r\nby recognizing the unfairness of suddenly enforcing a law the long disuse\r\nof which has led many to presume upon continued impunity for breaking it.\r\nHe therefore has been reviving it gradually, and hopes that offenders\r\nwill not force him to execute it with rigour.\r\n\r\nWhat stands out clearly in this picture of the water-service is the utter\r\nlack of public spirit imputed to the landowners near Rome by a careful\r\nand responsible public servant of good repute. There is none of the\r\nsermonizing of Seneca or the sneers and lamentations of Pliny. Frontinus\r\ntakes things as they are, finds them bad, and means to do his best to\r\nimprove them, while avoiding the temptations of the new broom. That a\r\ngreat quantity of water was being, and had long been, diverted from\r\nthe public aqueducts to serve suburban villas and gardens, is certain.\r\nWhat we do not learn is whether much or any of this was used for the\r\nmarket-gardens of the humble folk who grew[1182] garden-stuff for the\r\nRoman market. It is the old story,—little or nothing about the poor, save\r\nwhen in the form of a city rabble they achieve distinction as a public\r\nburden and nuisance. It does however seem fairly certain that licenses\r\nto abstract water were only granted as a matter of special favour.\r\nTherefore, so far as licensed abstraction went, it is most probable that\r\ninfluential owners of _suburbana_ were the only beneficiaries. Theft of\r\nwater with connivance[1183] of the staff was only possible for those\r\nwho could afford to bribe. There remains the alternative of taking it by\r\neluding or defying the vigilance of the staff. Is it probable that the\r\npoor market-gardener ventured to do this? Not often, I fancy: we can only\r\nguess, and I doubt whether much of the intercepted water came his way.\r\nThere was it is true one aqueduct[1184] the water of which was of poor\r\nquality. It was a work of Augustus, intended to supply the great pond\r\n(_naumachia_) in which sham sea-fights were held to amuse the public.\r\nWhen not so employed, this water was made available for irrigation of\r\ngardens. This was on the western or Vatican side of the Tiber. Many rich\r\nmen had pleasure-gardens in that part, and we cannot be sure that even\r\nthis water was in practice serving any economic purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX. INSCRIPTIONS RELATIVE TO _ALIMENTA_.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to leave unnoticed the inscriptions[1185] of this period\r\nrelative to _alimenta_, and Mommsen’s interpretation[1186] of the two\r\nchief ones, though their connexion with my present subject is not very\r\nclose. In the bronze tablets recording respectively the declarations of\r\nestate-values in the communes of Ligures Baebiani (101 AD) and Veleia\r\n(103 AD), made with the view of ascertaining the securities upon which\r\nthe capital endowment was to be advanced, we have interesting details of\r\nthis ingenious scheme for perpetuating charity. But neither these, nor\r\nsome minor inscribed records of bequests, nor again the experience of\r\nPliny the younger in a benefaction[1187] of the same kind, give us direct\r\nevidence on labour-questions. It is in connexion with tenure of land and\r\nmanagement of estates that these documents mainly concern us. The fact\r\nthat there was felt to be a call for charities to encourage the rearing\r\nof children was assuredly not a sign of social or economic wellbeing; but\r\nthis I have remarked above.\r\n\r\nThe following points stand out clearly in the interpretation of Mommsen.\r\nThe growth of large estates as against small is shewn in both the\r\ntablets as having gone far by the time of Trajan: but not so far as\r\nmodern writers have imagined. In the case of the Ligures Baebiani there\r\nis record of a considerable number of properties of moderate value,\r\nindeed they are in a majority. At Veleia, though small estates have not\r\ndisappeared, there are more large ones, and the process of absorption\r\nhas evidently been more active. This was not strange, for the former\r\ncase belongs to the Hirpinian hill country of southern Italy, the latter\r\nto the slopes of the Apennine near Placentia, including some of the\r\nrich plain of the Po. The latter would naturally attract capital more\r\nthan the former. I have more than once remarked that in the upland\r\ndistricts agricultural conditions were far less revolutionized than in\r\nthe lowlands. This seems to be an instance in point: but the evidence is\r\nnot complete. There is nothing to shew that the estates named in these\r\ntablets were the sole landed properties of their several owners. Nor is\r\nit probable. To own estates in different parts of the country was a well\r\nunderstood policy of landlords. How we are to draw conclusions as to the\r\nprevalence of great estates from a few isolated local instances, without\r\na statement of the entire landed properties of the persons named, I\r\ncannot see. That writers of the Empire, when they speak of _latifundia_,\r\nare seldom thinking of the crude and brutal plantation-system of an\r\nearlier time, is very true. Those vast arable farms with their huge\r\nslave-gangs were now out of fashion, and Mommsen points out that our\r\nrecords are practically silent as to large-scale arable farming. We are\r\nnot to suppose that it was extinct, but it was probably rare.\r\n\r\nThe most valuable part of this paper is its recognition of the vital\r\nchange in Italian agriculture, the transfer of farming from a basis of\r\nownership to one of tenancy. The yeoman or owner-cultivator of olden\r\ntime had been driven out or made a rare figure in the most eligible\r\nparts of Italy. The great plantations, which had largely superseded the\r\nsmall-scale farms, had in their turn proved economic failures. Both\r\nthese systems, in most respects strongly contrasted, had one point in\r\ncommon: the land was cultivated by or for the owner, and for his own\r\naccount. But the failure of the large-scale plantation-system did not so\r\nreact as to bring back small ownership. Large ownership still remained,\r\nsupported as it was by the social importance attached to landowning, and\r\noccasionally by governmental action directed to encourage investment in\r\nItalian land. Large owners long struggled to keep their estates in hand\r\nunder stewards farming for their masters’ account. But this plan was\r\ndoomed to failure, because the care and attention necessary to make it\r\npay were in most cases greater than landlords were willing to bestow. By\r\nColumella’s time this fact was already becoming evident. He could only\r\nadvise the landlords to be other than he found them, and meanwhile point\r\nto an alternative, namely application of the tenancy-system. It was this\r\nlatter plan that more and more found favour. The landlord could live in\r\ntown and draw his rents, himself free to pursue his own occupations.\r\nThe tenant-farmer was only bound by the terms of his lease; and, being\r\nresident, was able to exact the full labour of his staff and prevent\r\nwaste and robbery. The custom was for the landlord to provide[1188]\r\nthe equipment (_instrumentum_) of the farm, or at least most of it,\r\nincluding slaves. Thus he was in a sense partner of his tenant, finding\r\nmost of the working capital. Whether he had a claim to a money rent only,\r\nor to a share of crops also, depended on the terms of letting. It seems\r\nthat rents were often in arrear, and that attempts to recover sums due by\r\nselling up tenants’ goods did not always cover the debts.\r\n\r\nThe typical tenant-farmer was certainly a ‘small man.’ To let the whole\r\nof a large estate to a ‘big man’ with plenty of capital was not the\r\npractice in Italy. Why? I think the main reason was that a big capitalist\r\nwho wanted to get the highest return on his money could at this time do\r\nbetter for himself in other ventures: if set upon a land-enterprise, he\r\ncould find far more attractive openings in some of the Provinces. Anyhow,\r\nas Mommsen says, ‘Grosspacht’ never became acclimatized in Italy, though\r\nwe find it on Imperial domains, for instance in Africa. In connexion with\r\nthis matter I am led to remark that small tenancy ‘Kleinpacht’ seems\r\nto have existed in two forms, perhaps indistinguishable in law, but\r\ndifferent in their practical effect. When a landlord, letting parcels\r\nof a big estate to tenants, kept in hand the chief _villa_ and its\r\nappurtenances as a sort of Manor Farm, and tenants fell into arrear with\r\ntheir rent, he had a ready means of indemnifying himself without ‘selling\r\nup’ his old tenants and having possibly much difficulty in finding\r\nbetter new ones. He could commute arrears of rent into obligations of\r\nservice[1189] on the Manor Farm. Most tenants would probably be only too\r\nglad to get rid of the immediate burden of debt. It would seem a better\r\ncourse than to borrow for that purpose money on which interest would have\r\nto be paid, even supposing that anyone would be willing to lend to a poor\r\ntenant confessedly in difficulties. And such an arrangement would furnish\r\nthe landlord with a fixed amount of labour (and labour was becoming\r\nscarcer) on very favourable terms—he or his agent would see to that. But\r\nit was not really necessary to reserve a ‘Manor Farm’ at all, and a man\r\nowning land in several districts would hardly do so in every estate,\r\nif in any. Such a landlord could not readily solve the arrears-problem\r\nby commutation. He was almost compelled[1190] to ‘sell up’ a hopeless\r\ndefaulter: and, since most of the stock had probably been supplied by\r\nhimself, there would not be much for him to sell. That such cases did\r\noccur, we know for certain; the old tenant went, being free to move,\r\nand to find a good new one was no easy matter, particularly as the land\r\nwas sure to have been left in a bad state. Arrears of farm-rents had a\r\nregular phrase (_reliqua colonorum_) assigned to them, and there is good\r\nreason to believe that they were a common source of trouble. It has been\r\nwell said[1191] that landlords in Italy were often as badly off as their\r\ntenants. The truth is that the whole agricultural interest was going\r\ndownhill.\r\n\r\nIf the tenant-farmer was, as we see, becoming more and more the central\r\nfigure of Italian agriculture, we must next inquire how he stood in\r\nrelation to labour. It is _a priori_ probable that a man will be more\r\nready to work with his own hands on a farm of his own than on one\r\nhired: no man is more alive to the difference of _meum_ and _alienum_\r\nthan the tiller of the soil. It is therefore not wonderful that we find\r\ntenant-farmers employing slave labour. From the custom of having slaves\r\nas well as other stock supplied by the landlord we may fairly infer that\r\ntenants were, at least generally, not to be had on other terms. Mommsen\r\nremarks[1192] that actual handwork on the land was more and more directed\r\nrather than performed by the small tenants. Thus it came to be more and\r\nmore done by unfree persons. This recognizes, no doubt rightly, that the\r\nsystem of great estates let in portions to tenants was not favourable\r\nto a revival of free rustic labour, but told effectively against it. He\r\nalso points out[1193] that under Roman Law it was possible for a landlord\r\nand his slave to stand in the mutual relation of lessor and lessee. Such\r\na slave lessee is distinct from the free tenant _colonus_. It appears\r\nthat there were two forms of this relation. The slave might be farming\r\non his own[1194] account, paying a rent and taking the farm-profits\r\nas his _peculium_. In this case he is in the eye of the law _quasi\r\ncolonus_. Or he might be farming on his master’s account; then he is\r\n_vilicus_. In both cases he is assumed to have under him slave-labourers\r\nsupplied[1195] by the landlord, and it seems that the name _vilicus_ was\r\nsometimes loosely applied even in the former case. In the latter case\r\nhe cannot have been very different from the steward of a large estate\r\nworked for owner’s account. I can only conclude that he was put in charge\r\nof a smaller farm-unit and left more to his own devices. Probably this\r\narrangement would be resorted to only when an ordinary free tenant was\r\nnot to be had; and satisfactory ones were evidently not common in the\r\ntime of the younger Pliny.\r\n\r\nSo far as I can see, in this period landlords were gradually ceasing to\r\nkeep a direct control over the management of their own estates, but the\r\nchanges in progress did not tend to a rehabilitation of free labour.\r\nOne detail needs a brief special consideration. The landlord’s agent\r\n(_actor_) is often mentioned, and it is clear that the _actor_ was\r\ngenerally a slave. But there is reference to the possible case[1196] of\r\nan _actor_ living (like his master) in town, not on the farms, and having\r\na wife[1197] and daughter. This suggests a freedman, not a slave, and\r\nsuch cases may have been fairly numerous. Another point for notice is the\r\nquestion of _vincti, alligati, compediti_, in this period. Mommsen[1198]\r\ntreats the chaining of field-slaves as being quite exceptional, in fact a\r\npunishment, in Italy under the Empire. Surely it was always in some sense\r\na punishment. From what Columella[1199] says of the normal employment\r\nof chained labourers in vineyard-work I can not admit that the evidence\r\njustifies Mommsen’s assertion. That there was a growing reluctance to use\r\nsuch barbarous methods, and that local usage varied in various parts of\r\nthe country, is certain.\r\n\r\n\r\nXL. DION CHRYSOSTOM.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that there is no lack of evidence as to the lamentable\r\ncondition of Italian agriculture in a large part of the country. But\r\nthings were no better in certain Provinces, more particularly in Greece.\r\nPlutarch deplores[1200] the decay and depopulation of his native land,\r\nbut the most vivid and significant picture preserved to us is one\r\nconveyed in a public address[1201] by the famous lecturer =Dion of\r\nPrusa=, better known as Dion[1202] Chrysostom. It describes conditions\r\nin the once prosperous island of Euboea. The speaker professes to\r\nhave been cast ashore there in a storm, and to have been entertained\r\nwith extraordinary kindness by some honest rustics who were living an\r\nindustrious and harmless life in the upland parts, the rocky shore of\r\nwhich was notorious as a scene of shipwrecks. There were two connected\r\nhouseholds, squatters in the lonely waste, producing by their own\r\nexertions everything they needed, and of course patterns of every amiable\r\nvirtue. The lecturer recounts the story of these interesting people as\r\ntold him by his host. How much of it is due to his own imagination, or\r\nput together out of various stories, we cannot judge: but it is manifest\r\nthat what concerns us is to feel satisfied that the experiences described\r\nwere possible, and not grotesquely improbable, in their setting of place\r\nand time. I venture to accept the story as a sketch of what might very\r\nwell have happened, whether it actually did so or not.\r\n\r\nWe live mostly by the chase, said the hunter, with very little tillage.\r\nThis croft (χωρίον) does not belong to us either by inheritance or\r\npurchase. Our fathers, though freemen, were poor like ourselves, just\r\nhired herdsmen, in charge of the herds of a rich man who owned wide\r\nfarm-lands and all these mountains. When he died, his estate was\r\nconfiscated: It is said that the emperor[1203] made away with him to\r\nget his property. Well, they drove off his live-stock for slaughter,\r\nand our few oxen with them, and never paid our wages. So we did the\r\nbest we could, taking advantage of the resources of the neighbourhood\r\nin summer and winter. Since childhood I have only once visited the\r\ncity[1204]. A man turned up one day demanding money. We had none, and I\r\ntold him so on my oath. He bade me come with him to the city. There I\r\nwas arraigned before the mob as a squatter on the public land, without\r\na grant from the people, and without any payment. It was hinted that we\r\nwere wreckers, and had put together a fine property through that wicked\r\ntrade. We were said to have valuable farms and abundance of flocks and\r\nherds, beasts of burden, slaves. But a wiser speaker took a different\r\nline. He urged that those who turned the public land to good account\r\nwere public benefactors and deserved encouragement. He pointed out that\r\ntwo thirds of their territory was lying waste through neglect and lack\r\nof population. He was himself a large landowner: whoever was willing to\r\ncultivate his land was welcome to do so free of charge,—indeed he would\r\nreward him for his pains—the improvement would be worth it. He proposed\r\na plan for inducing citizens to reclaim the derelict lands, rent-free\r\nfor ten years, and after that rented at a moderate share of the crops.\r\nTo aliens less favourable terms might be offered, but with a prospect of\r\ncitizenship in case of reclamation on a large scale. By such a policy the\r\nevils of idleness and poverty would be got rid of. These considerations\r\nhe enforced by pointing to the pitiful state of the city itself. Outside\r\nthe gates you find, not a suburb but a hideous desert. Within the walls\r\nwe grow crops and graze beasts on the sites of the gymnasium and the\r\nmarket-place. Statues of gods and heroes are smothered in the growing\r\ncorn. Yet we are forsooth to expel these hard-working folks and to leave\r\nmen nothing to do but to rob or steal.\r\n\r\nThe rustic, being called upon to state his own case, described the\r\npoverty of the squatter families, the innocence of their lives, their\r\nservices to shipwrecked seafarers, and so forth. On the last topic he\r\nreceived a dramatic confirmation from a man in the crowd, who had himself\r\nbeen one of a party of castaways hospitably relieved three years before\r\nby these very people. So all ended well. The stress laid on the simple\r\nrusticity of the rustic, and the mutual distrust and mean jealousy of\r\nthe townsfolk, shew in numerous touches that we have in this narrative\r\na highly coloured scene. But the picture of the decayed city, with its\r\nancient walls a world too wide for its shrunk population, is companion to\r\nthat of the deserted countryside. Both panels of this mournful diptych\r\ncould have been paralleled in the case of many a city and territory in\r\nItaly and Greece. The moral reflexions, in which the lecturer proceeds\r\nto apply the lessons of the narrative, are significant. He enlarges on\r\nthe superiority of the poor to the rich in many virtues, unselfishness\r\nin particular. Poverty in itself is not naturally an evil. If men will\r\nonly work with their own hands, they may supply their own needs, and\r\nlive a life worthy of freemen. The word αὐτουργεῖν occurs more than once\r\nin this spirited appeal, shewing clearly that Dion had detected the\r\nplague-spot in the civilization of his day. But he honestly admits the\r\ngrave difficulties that beset artisans in the various trades practised\r\nin towns. They lack necessary[1205] capital: everything has to be paid\r\nfor, food clothing lodging fuel and what not, for they get nothing free\r\nbut water, and own nothing but their bodies. Yet we cannot advise them to\r\nengage in foul degrading vocations. We desire them to live honourably,\r\nnot to sink below the standards of the greedy usurer or the owners of\r\nlodging-houses or ships or gangs of slaves. What then are we to do with\r\nthe decent poor? Shall we have to propose turning them out of the cities\r\nand settling them on allotments in the country? Tradition tells us rural\r\nsettlement prevailed throughout Attica of yore: and the system worked\r\nwell, producing citizens of a better and more discreet type than the\r\ntown-bred mechanics who thronged the Assemblies and law-courts of Athens.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that Dion is a mere itinerant philosopher, who travels\r\nabout seeing the world and proposing impracticable remedies for\r\ncontemporary evils in popular sermons to idle audiences. But he knew his\r\ntrade, and his trade was to make his hearers ‘feel better’ for attending\r\nhis discourses. When he portrays the follies or vices of the age, he is\r\ndealing with matters of common knowledge, and not likely to misrepresent\r\nfacts seriously. When he suggests remedies, it matters little that\r\nthere is no possibility of applying them. Present company are always\r\nexcepted, and the townsfolk who listened to the preacher would neither\r\nresent his strictures on city life nor have the slightest intention of\r\nsetting their own hands to the spade or plough. That there was a kind of\r\nmoral reaction[1206] in this period, and that lecturers and essayists\r\ncontributed something to the revival of healthier public sentiment, I do\r\nnot dispute; though I think too much success is sometimes[1207] ascribed\r\nto their good intentions. At any rate they cannot be credited with\r\nimproving the conditions of rustic life. To the farmer the voice of the\r\ngreat world outside was represented by the collectors of rents and taxes,\r\nthe exactors of services, not by the sympathetic homilies of popular\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI. NEW TESTAMENT WRITERS.\r\n\r\nThe authors of the books of the New Testament, whom it is convenient\r\nto view together as a group of witnesses bearing on the condition of a\r\npart of the Roman East under the early Empire, supply some interesting\r\nmatter. We read of an agriculture that includes corn-growing, the culture\r\nof vines, and pastoral industry: the olive, and above all the fig-tree,\r\nappear as normal objects of the countryside. Plough spade and sickle,\r\nstorehouse threshing-floor and winepress, are the familiar appliances\r\nof rustic life, as they had been from time immemorial. Farmers need not\r\nonly hard work, but watchfulness and forethought, for the business of\r\ntheir lives. Live stock have to be protected from beasts of prey, and\r\nneed endless care. And the rustic’s outlook is ever clouded by the fear\r\nof drought and murrain. All this is an ordinary picture, common to many\r\nlands: only the anxiety about water-supply is perhaps specially Oriental.\r\nThe ox and the ass are the chief beasts of draught and burden. In short,\r\ncountry life goes on as of old, and much as it still does after many\r\nchanges of rulers.\r\n\r\nFrom the way in which farmers are generally spoken of I infer that they\r\nare normally peasant[1208] landowners. That is to say, not tenants of\r\nan individual landlord, but holding their farms with power of sale and\r\nright of succession, liable to tribute. The Roman state is strictly\r\nspeaking the owner, having succeeded to the royal ownership assumed by\r\nthe Seleucid kings. But that there was also letting[1209] of estates\r\nto tenant-farmers is clear, for we read of collection of rents. At the\r\nsame time we find it suggested, apparently as a moral rather than legal\r\nobligation, that the toiling farmer has the first claim[1210] on the\r\nproduce, and the ox is not to be muzzled. Such passages, and others\r\ninsisting on honesty and the duty of labour, keep us firmly reminded of\r\nthe moral aims pervading the works of these writers. In other words, they\r\nare more concerned to define what ought to be than to record what is.\r\nMany of the significant references to rustic matters occur in parables.\r\nBut we must not forget that a parable would have little force if its\r\ndetails were not realistic.\r\n\r\nOf the figures appearing on the agricultural scene we may distinguish\r\nthe wealthy landlord[1211], whether farming for his own account or\r\nletting his land to tenants: the steward[1212] farming for his lord’s\r\naccount: the tenant-farmer: probably the free peasant on a small holding\r\nof his own. Labour is represented by the farmer working with his own\r\nhands, and by persons employed simply as labourers. These last are\r\neither freemen or slaves. Slavery is assumed as a normal condition, but\r\na reader can hardly help being struck by the notable passages in which\r\nthe wage-earner appears as a means of illustrating an important point.\r\nDoes the occurrence of such passages suggest that in these Oriental\r\nsurroundings wage-service was as common a system as bond-service, perhaps\r\neven more so? I hesitate to draw this conclusion, for the following\r\nreason. Accepting the fact of slavery (as the writers do), there was not\r\nmuch to be said beyond enjoining humanity on masters and conscientious\r\nand respectful service on slaves. But the relation between hirer and\r\nhired, presumably a bargain, opened up far-reaching issues of equity,\r\ntranscending questions of formal law. Hence we hear much about it. That\r\nthe workman is worthy of his meat (ἐργάτης ... τροφῆς) is a proposition\r\nof which we have an earlier[1213] version, referring to slaves. The\r\ncowardice of the hireling shepherd points a notable moral. The rich who\r\ndefraud the reaper of his hire[1214] meet with scathing denunciation. For\r\nto him that worketh the reward is not reckoned[1215] of grace but of debt.\r\n\r\nThis last proposition seems to furnish a key to the remarkable\r\nparable[1216] of the Labourers in the Vineyard, which has been subjected\r\nto many diverse interpretations. If we accept the view that the wages\r\nrepresent the Kingdom of God, and that this reward is granted not of debt\r\nbut of grace, it is clear that great stress is laid on the autocratic\r\nposition of the householder (οἰκοδεσπότης). His treatment of the hired\r\nlabourers is an assertion of entire indifference to what we call\r\n‘economic’ considerations. How it is to be interpreted as equitable,\r\ntheologians must decide, or be content to leave modern handworkers to\r\ndraw their own conclusions. My interest in the matter may be shewn in the\r\nquestion whether this householder is to be regarded as a typical figure,\r\nor not. I trust I am guilty of no irreverence in saying that to me he\r\nseems a purely hypothetical character. That is to say that I take the\r\ngist of the parable to be this: if an employer chose to deal with his\r\nhirelings on such arbitrary principles, he would be acting within his\r\nrights. I do not infer that such conduct was likely in ordinary life, or\r\neven that a concrete case of its occurrence had ever been known. I cannot\r\nbelieve that in a country where debts[1217] and usury are referred to\r\nas matters of course, and where masters entrusted money[1218] to their\r\nslaves for purposes of trade, where sales of land[1219] were an ordinary\r\nbusiness transaction, a sane individualistic capitalist would act as the\r\nman in this parable. Those who think differently must clear up their own\r\ndifficulties. I would add that this parable, the details of which seem to\r\nme non-realistic, only occurs in one of the Gospels. Is it possible that\r\nit is based on some current Oriental story?\r\n\r\n\r\nXLII. MARTIAL AND JUVENAL.\r\n\r\nAmong the witnesses, other than technical writers, from whom we get\r\nevidence as to the conditions of agriculture under the Empire, are two\r\npoets, Martial and Juvenal. The latter, a native of Aquinum in the old\r\nVolscian part of Latium, never shook off the influence of his connexion\r\nwith rural Italy. The former, a native of Bilbilis in Spain, was one of\r\nthe gifted provincials who came to Rome as the literary centre of the\r\nworld. He spent more than thirty years there, and made an unrivalled name\r\nas a writer of epigrams, but his heart was in Spain. The attitude of\r\nthese two men towards the facts of their time is very different, and the\r\ndifference affects the value of their evidence. In the satires of Juvenal\r\nindignant rhetoric takes up a high moral position, and declaims fiercely\r\nagainst abominations. Now this attitude is beset with temptations to\r\noverstate an evil rather than weaken effect. Moreover, in imperial Rome\r\nit was necessary to be very careful: not only were personal references\r\ndangerous, but it was above all things necessary to avoid provoking\r\nthe Emperor. Yet even Emperors could (and did) view attacks upon their\r\npredecessors with indifference or approval: while vicious contemporaries\r\nwere not likely to put on the cap if their deceased counterparts were\r\nassailed. So the satirist, confining his strictures mainly to the past,\r\nis not often a contemporary witness of the first order. It is fortunate\r\nthat his references to rustic conditions are not much affected by this\r\nlimitation: but they mostly refer to the past. =Martial= on the contrary\r\nis a mere man of his time. His business is not to censure, still less to\r\nreform, but to find themes for light verse such as will hit the taste of\r\naverage Roman readers. He soon discovered that scandal was the one staple\r\ntopic of interest, and exploited it as a source of ‘copy’ down to the\r\nfoulest dregs. Most of the characters exposed appear under fictitious\r\nGreek names, but doubtless Roman gossips applied the filthy imputations\r\nto each other. We need not suppose that Martial’s ruling passion was\r\nfor bawdy epigram. But he knew what would hit the taste of an idle and\r\nlibidinous world. For himself, nothing is clearer than that he found\r\nlife in the great city a sore trial, not solely from the oppressive\r\nclimate at certain seasons of the year. He was too clever a man not to\r\nsuffer weariness in such surroundings. He had to practice the servility\r\nhabitually displayed by poor men towards the rich and influential, but\r\nhe did not like it. It seems to have been through patronage that he got\r\ntogether sufficient wealth to enable him eventually to retire to his\r\nnative country. The din and dirt and chronic unrest of Rome were to him,\r\nas to Juvenal, an abomination: and from these ever-present evils there\r\nwas, for dwellers in mean houses or crowded blocks of sordid flats, no\r\nescape. Both writers agree that the Rome of those days was only fit\r\nfor the wealthy to live in. Secure in his grand mansion on one of the\r\nhealthiest sites, with plenty of elbow-room, guarded against unwelcome\r\nintrusions by a host of slaves and escorted by them in public, the\r\nmillionaire could take his life easily: he could even sleep. Martial\r\nhad his way to make as a man of letters, and needed to keep brain and\r\nnerves in working order. For this, occasional retirement from the\r\nurban pandemonium was necessary. So he managed to acquire a little\r\nsuburban[1220] property, where he could spend days in peace and quiet.\r\nMany of his friends did the same. To keep such a place, however small,\r\nin good order, and to grow some country produce, however little, it was\r\nnecessary to have a resident[1221] _vilicus_. He had also a _vilica_,\r\nand there would probably be a slave or two under them. The poet was now\r\nbetter off, and doing as others did. These _suburbana_, retreats for\r\nthe weary, were evidently numerous. Their agricultural significance\r\nwas small. Martial often pokes fun at the owners who withdraw to the\r\ncountry for a holiday, taking with them[1222] their supplies of eatables\r\nbought in the markets of Rome. Clearly the city markets were well\r\nsupplied: and this indicates the existence of another class of suburban\r\nproperties, market-gardens on a business footing, of which we hear little\r\ndirectly. An industry of this kind springs up round every great centre\r\nof population: how far it can extend depends on the available means\r\nof delivering the produce in fair marketable condition. Round Rome it\r\nhad no doubt existed for centuries, and was probably one of the most\r\neconomically sound agricultural undertakings in central Italy. That it\r\nwas conducted on a small scale and was prosperous may be the reason why\r\nit attracted little notice in literature.\r\n\r\nThough Martial cannot be regarded as an authority on Italian agriculture,\r\nit so happens that passages of his works are important and instructive,\r\nparticularly in connexion with matters of land-management and\r\nfarm-labour. He gives point to his epigrams by short and vivid touches,\r\nabove all by telling contrasts. Now this style of writing loses most of\r\nits force if the details lack reality. He was therefore little tempted\r\nto go beyond the truth in matters of ordinary non-bestial life, such\r\nas agricultural conditions; we may accept him as a good witness. To\r\nbegin with an all-important topic, let us see what we get from him on\r\nthe management of land, either for the landlord’s account under a slave\r\n_vilicus_, or by letting it to a free _colonus_. In explaining the\r\ngloomy bearing of Selius, he remarks[1223] that it is not due to recent\r\nlosses: his wife and his goods and his slaves are all safe, and he is\r\nnot suffering from any failures of a tenant or a steward. Here _colonus_\r\nas opposed to _vilicus_ must mean a free tenant, who might be behindhand\r\nwith his rent or with service due under his lease. The opposition occurs\r\nelsewhere, as when he refers[1224] to the produce sent in to a rich man\r\nin Rome from his country estates by his steward or tenant. So too on\r\nthe birthday of an eminent advocate all his clients and dependants send\r\ngifts; among them[1225] the hunter sends a hare, the fisherman some\r\nfish, and the _colonus_ a kid. The _venator_ and _piscator_ are very\r\nlikely his slaves. In protesting[1226] against the plague of kissing as\r\nit strikes a man on return to Rome, he says, ‘all the neighbours kiss\r\nyou, and the _colonus_ too with his hairy unsavoury mouth.’ It seems to\r\nimply that the rustic tenant would come to Town to pay his respects to\r\nhis landlord. Barring the kiss, the duty of welcoming the squire makes\r\none think of times not long gone by in England. In one passage[1227]\r\nthere is a touch suggestive of almost medieval relations. How Linus has\r\nmanaged to get through a large inherited fortune, is a mystery in need\r\nof an explanation. He has not been a victim of the temptations of the\r\ngreat wicked city. No, he has always lived in a country town, where\r\neconomy was not only possible but easy. Everything he needed was to be\r\nhad cheap or gratis, and there was nothing to lead him into extravagant\r\nways. Now among the instances of cheapness is the means of satisfying\r\nhis sexual passions when they become unruly. At such moments either\r\nthe _vilica_ or the _duri nupta coloni_ served his turn. The steward’s\r\nconsort would be his slave, and there is no more to be said: but the\r\ntenant-farmer’s wife, presumably a free woman, is on a different footing.\r\nThere is no suggestion of hoodwinking the husband, for the situation is\r\ntreated as a matter of course. It would rather seem that the landlord\r\nis represented as relying on the complaisance of a dependent boor. If I\r\ninterpret the passage rightly, we have in it a vivid sidelight on the\r\nposition of some at least of the _coloni_ of the first century AD. That\r\n_vilici_ and _coloni_ alike were usually clumsy rustics of small manual\r\nskill, is suggested by two passages[1228] in which they are credited with\r\nbungling workmanship in wood or stone. Perhaps we may detect reference\r\nto a _colonus_ in an epigram on a man who spends his money lavishly on\r\nhis own debaucheries but is meanly niggardly to necessitous friends. It\r\nsays ‘you sell ancestral lands to pay for a passing gratification of your\r\nlust, while your friend, left in the lurch, is tilling land[1229] that\r\nis not his own.’ That is, you might have made him a present of a little\r\nfarm, as many another has done; but you have left him to sink into a mere\r\n_colonus_. Enough has now been said to shew that these tenant-farmers\r\nwere a humble and dependent class of men, and that the picture drawn\r\nfrom passages of Martial corresponds to that drawn above in Weber’s\r\ninterpretation of Columella.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to set out with the same fulness all the evidence\r\nof Martial on agricultural matters regarded from various points of\r\nview. The frequent reference to the land is a striking fact: like his\r\nfellow-countryman Columella, he was clearly interested in the land-system\r\nof Italy. He shews wide knowledge of the special products of different\r\ndistricts; a knowledge probably picked up at first in the markets of\r\nRome, and afterwards increased by experience. No writer draws the line\r\nmore distinctly between productive and unproductive estates. That we\r\nhear very much more of the latter is no wonder: so long as the supremacy\r\nof Rome was unshaken, and money poured into Italy, a great part of the\r\ncountry was held by wealthy owners to whom profit was a less urgent\r\nmotive than pleasure or pride. To what lengths ostentation could go is\r\nseen[1230] in the perverse fancy of a millionaire to have a real _rus in\r\nurbe_ with grounds about his town house so spacious that they included\r\na real vineyard: here in sheltered seclusion he could have a vintage in\r\nRome. This is in truth the same vulgar ambition as that (much commoner)\r\nof the man who prides himself on treating guests at his country mansion\r\nto every luxury procurable in Rome. It is merely inverted.\r\n\r\nAt this point it is natural to ask whence came the vast sums lavished\r\non these and other forms of luxury. Italy was not a great manufacturing\r\ncountry. The regular dues from the Provinces flowed into the treasuries,\r\nnot openly into private pockets. Yet a good deal of these monies no doubt\r\ndid in the end become the reward of individuals, as salaries or amounts\r\npayable to contractors, etc. These however would not by themselves\r\nsuffice to account for the immense squandering that evidently took place.\r\nA source of incomes, probably much more productive than we might at first\r\nsight imagine, existed in the huge estates owned by wealthy Romans in\r\nthe lands beyond the seas. Martial refers[1231] to such properties at\r\nPatrae in Achaia, in Egypt, etc. The returns from these estates, however\r\nbadly managed, were in the total probably very large. And they were no\r\nnew thing. In Varro and in Cicero’s letters we find them treated as a\r\nmatter of course: the case of Atticus and his lands in Epirus is well\r\nknown. Pliny[1232] tells us of the case of Pompey, and also of the six\r\nland-monopolizers whom Nero found in possession of 50% of the Province\r\nof Africa. The practice of usury in the subject countries was no longer\r\nso widespread or so remunerative as it had been in the last period of\r\nthe Republic, but it had not ceased, and the same is true of the farming\r\nof revenues. Commerce was active: but we are rather concerned with the\r\nmeans of paying for imported goods than with the fact of importation.\r\nThe anxiety as to the supply of corn from abroad shews itself in the\r\ngossip[1233] of quidnuncs as to the fleet of freight-ships coming from\r\nAlexandria. Puteoli and Ostia were doubtless very busy; all we need note\r\nis that someone must have made money[1234] in the business of transport\r\nand delivery. These considerations may serve to explain the presence of\r\nso much ‘money in the country’ as we say, and the resulting extravagance.\r\nBut all this social and economic fabric rested on the security guaranteed\r\nby the imperial forces on land and sea.\r\n\r\nOne of Martial’s epigrams[1235] is of special interest as describing\r\na manifestly exceptional estate. It was at or near Baiae, the famous\r\nseaside pleasure-resort, which had been the scene of costly fancies\r\nand luxurious living for more than a hundred years. The point of\r\nthe poem lies in the striking contrast of this place compared with\r\nthe unproductive _suburbanum_[1236] of another owner, which is kept\r\ngoing by supplies from the Roman market. For the place is a genuine\r\nunsophisticated country farm, producing corn and wine and good store of\r\nfirewood, and breeding cattle swine sheep and various kinds of poultry\r\nand pigeons. When rustic neighbours come to pay their respects, they\r\nbring presents, such as honey in the comb, cheese, dormice, a kid, a\r\ncapon. The daughters[1237] of honest tenants bring baskets of eggs. The\r\n_villa_ is a centre of hospitality; even the slaves are well fed. The\r\npresence of a slave-household brought from Town is particularly dwelt\r\non: what with fishing and trapping and with ‘light work’ in the garden,\r\nthese spoilt menials, even my lord’s pet eunuch, are happy enough. There\r\nare also young home-bred slaves (_vernae_) probably the offspring of the\r\nfarm-slaves. The topsyturvydom of this epigram is so striking that one\r\nmay suspect Martial of laughing in his sleeve at the eccentric friend\r\nwhose farm he is praising. In any case this cannot be taken seriously\r\nas a realistic picture of a country seat practically agricultural. The\r\nowner evidently drew his income from other sources. And the sort of man\r\nwho treated himself to an eunuch can hardly have been much of a farmer,\r\neven near Baiae. The mention of _probi coloni_ illustrates what has been\r\nsaid above as to tenants, and that a farm could be described in such\r\nwords as _rure vero barbaroque_ is a candid admission that in too many\r\ninstances a place of the kind could only by courtesy be styled a farm,\r\nsince the intrusion of ‘civilization’ (that is, of refined and luxurious\r\nurban elements) destroyed its practical rustic character. That the\r\nestate in question produced enough to feed the owner and his guests, his\r\ndomestics brought from Rome, and the resident rustic staff as well, is\r\ncredible. But there is nothing to shew that it produced any surplus for\r\nthe markets: it may have done something in this direction, but that it\r\nreally paid its way, yielding a moderate return on the capital sunk in\r\nland slaves and other farm-stock, is utterly incredible.\r\n\r\nWhether in town or country, the life sketched by Martial is that of a\r\nsociety resting on a basis of slavery. At the same time the supply of\r\nnew slaves[1238] was not so plentiful as it had been in days before the\r\nRoman Peace under Augustus. Serviceable rustic slaves were valuable\r\nnowadays. Addressing Faustinus, the wealthy owner of the above Baian\r\n_villa_ and several others, the poet says ‘you can send this book[1239]\r\nto Marcellinus, who is now at the end of his campaign in the North and\r\nhas leisure to read: but let your messenger be a dainty Greek page.\r\nMarcellinus will requite you by sending you a slave, captive from the\r\nDanube country, who has the making of a shepherd in him, to tend the\r\nflocks on your estate by Tibur.’ Each friend is to send the other\r\nwhat the other lacks and he is in a position to supply. This is a\r\nsingle instance; but the suggested _do ut des_ is significant. As wars\r\nbecame rarer, and prisoners fewer, the disposal of captives would be a\r\nperquisite of more and more value. That the normal treatment of slaves\r\nwas becoming more and more humane, is certain. But whether humanitarian\r\nsentiment in Stoic forms, as preached by Seneca and others, had much\r\nto do with this result, is more doubtful. The wisdom of not provoking\r\ndiscontent among the slaves, particularly in the country, was well\r\nunderstood. The decline of the free rustic population had made the\r\nabsence of a regular police force a danger not to be ignored. Improved\r\nconditions were probably in most cases due to self-interest and caution\r\nmuch more than to humane sentiment. In Martial’s day we may gather from\r\nnumerous indications that in general the lot of slaves was not a hard one\r\nif we except the legal right of self-disposal. Urban domestics were often\r\nsadly spoilt, and were apt to give themselves great airs outside the\r\nhouse or to callers at the door. But I believe that in respect of comfort\r\nand happiness the position of a steward with a slave-staff in charge of\r\na country place owned by a rich man was in most cases far pleasanter.\r\nSubject to the preparation for the master’s occasional visits and\r\nentertainment of his guests, these men were left very much to their own\r\ndevices. The site of the _villa_ had been chosen for its advantages. So\r\nlong as enough work was done to satisfy the owner, they, his caretakers,\r\nenjoyed gratis for the whole year[1240] the privileges and pleasures\r\nwhich he paid for dearly and seldom used.\r\n\r\nIt seems certain that it was on such estates that most of the\r\nslave-breeding took place. It was becoming a more regular practice, as we\r\nsee from Columella. And it had advantages from several points of view.\r\nThe slave allowed to mate with a female partner and produce children\r\nwas more effectively tied to the place than the unmated labourer on a\r\nplantation was by his chain. So long as the little _vernae_ were not\r\nbrutally treated (and it seems to have been a tradition to treat them\r\nwell), the parents were much less likely to join in any rebellious\r\nschemes. And, after all, the young of slaves were worth money, if sold;\r\nwhile, if kept by the old master, they would work in what was the only\r\nhome they had known: they would be easier to train and manage than some\r\nraw barbarian from Germany or Britain or the Sudan. But it must not be\r\nforgotten that the recognition of slave-breeding foreboded the eventual\r\ndecline of slavery—personal slavery—as an institution, at least for\r\npurposes of rustic life. I know of no direct evidence[1241] as to the\r\nclass or classes from which the unfree _coloni_ of the later Empire were\r\ndrawn. But it seems to me extremely probable that many of the _coloni_\r\nof the period with which we are just now concerned were home-bred\r\nslaves manumitted and kept on the estate as tenants. This conjecture\r\nfinds a reason for manumission, as the freedman would be capable of a\r\nlegal relation, which the slave was not. The freedman’s son would be\r\n_ingenuus_, and would represent, in his economic bondage under cover of\r\nlegal freedom, a natural stage in the transition from the personal slave\r\nto the predial serf.\r\n\r\nThat there were _vernae_ on the small suburban properties, the\r\nrest-retreats of Martial and many others, is not to be doubted. But they\r\ncan hardly have been very numerous. These little places were often but\r\npoorly kept up. The owners were seldom wealthy men, able to maintain\r\nmany slaves. Economy and quiet were desired by men who could not afford\r\nostentation. The normal use of the epithet _sordidus_[1242] (not peculiar\r\nto Martial) in speaking of such places, and indeed of small farmsteads\r\nin general, is characteristic of them and of the undress life led there.\r\nThe house was sometimes in bad condition. To patch up a leaky roof[1243]\r\na present of a load of tiles was welcome. A man buys a place the house\r\n(_casa_) on which is horribly dark and old: the poet remarks that it is\r\nclose to the pleasure-garden (_hortos_) of a rich man. This explains\r\nthe purchase: the buyer will put up with bad lodging for the prospect\r\nof good dinners at his neighbour’s table. The difficulty of finding a\r\npurchaser for an estate of bad sanitary record, and the damage done to\r\nriparian farms by the Tiber floods, are instances[1244] of the ordinary\r\ntroubles of the little landowners near Rome. A peculiar nuisance, common\r\nin Italy, was the presence in some corner of a field of the tomb[1245]\r\nof some former owner or his family. A slice of the land, so many feet\r\nin length and breadth, was often reserved[1246] as not to pass with the\r\ninheritance. What the heir never owned, that he could not sell. So, when\r\nthe property changed hands, the new owner had no right to remove what to\r\nhim might be nothing but a hindrance to convenient tillage. Altars[1247]\r\ntaken over from a predecessor may also have been troublesome at times,\r\nbut their removal was probably less difficult.\r\n\r\nThe picture of agricultural conditions to be drawn from =Juvenal= agrees\r\nwith that drawn from Martial. But, as said above, the point of view is\r\ndifferent in the satirist, whose business it is to denounce evils, and\r\nwho is liable to fall into rhetorical exaggeration. And to a native of\r\ncentral Italy the tradition of a healthier state of things in earlier\r\nages was naturally a more important part of his background than it could\r\nbe to a man from Spain. Hence we find vivid scenes[1248] drawn from\r\nlegend, shewing good old Romans, men of distinction, working on the land\r\nthemselves and rearing well-fed families (slaves included) on the produce\r\nof meagre little plots of two _iugera_. An ex-consul[1249] breaks off his\r\nlabours on a hillside, shoulders his mattock, and joins a rustic feast\r\nat the house of a relative. The hill-folk of the Abruzzi are patterns of\r\nthrifty contentment, ready to earn their bread[1250] with the plough. But\r\nthe civic duties are not forgotten. The citizen has a double function.\r\nHe serves the state in arms and receives a patch of land[1251] as his\r\nreward for wounds suffered. He has to attend the Assembly before his\r\nwounds[1252] are fully healed. In short, he is a peasant soldier who\r\ndoes a public duty in both peace and war. The vital need of the present\r\nday[1253] is that parents should rear sons of this type. Here we have the\r\nmoral which these scenes, and the frequent references to ancient heroes,\r\nare meant to impress on contemporaries. A striking instance[1254] from\r\nhistorical times is that of Marius, who is represented as having risen\r\nfrom the position of a wage-earning farm-labourer to be the saviour of\r\nRome from the barbarians of the North. But the men of the olden time\r\nled simple lives, free from the extravagance and luxury of these days\r\nand therefore from the temptations and ailments that now abound. The\r\nonly wholesome surroundings[1255] now are to be found in out-of-the way\r\ncountry corners or the homes of such frugal citizens as Juvenal himself.\r\nBut these are mere islets in a sea of wantonness bred in security: luxury\r\nis deadlier[1256] than the sword, and the conquered world is being\r\navenged in the ruin of its conqueror. Perhaps no symptom on which he\r\nenlarges is more significant and sinister from his own point of view than\r\nthat betrayed in a passing reference by the verbal contrast[1257] between\r\n_paganus_ and _miles_. The peasant is no longer soldier: and in this fact\r\nthe weightiest movements of some 250 years of Roman history are virtually\r\nimplied.\r\n\r\nSo much for an appeal to the Roman past. But Juvenal, like Vergil before\r\nhim, was not content with this. He looks back to the primitive age[1258]\r\nof man’s appearance on earth and idealizes the state of things in this\r\npicture also. Mankind, rude healthy and chaste, had not yet reached\r\nthe notion of private property: therefore theft was unknown. The moral\r\nis not pressed in the passage where this description occurs; but it is\r\nworth noting because the greed of men in imperial Rome, and particularly\r\nin the form of land-grabbing and villa-building, is a favourite topic\r\nin the satires. All this side of contemporary life, viewed as the fruit\r\nof artificial appetites and unnecessary passions, is evidence of a\r\ndegeneracy that has been going on ever since the beginnings of society.\r\nAnd the worst of it is that those who thrive on present conditions are\r\nthe corrupt the servile and the mean, from whom no improvement can be\r\nhoped for. Juvenal’s picture of present facts as he sees them is quite\r\nenough to justify his pessimism. As a means of arresting degeneration he\r\nis only able to suggest a change[1259] of mind, in fact to urge people\r\nto be other than they are. But he cannot shew where the initiative is to\r\nbe found. Certainly not in the mongrel free populace of Rome, a rabble\r\nof parasites and beggars. Nor in the ranks of the wealthy freedmen into\r\nwhose hands the chief opportunities of enrichment have passed, thanks to\r\nthe imperial jealousy of genuine Romans and preference of supple aliens.\r\nThese freedmen are the typical capitalists: they buy up everything, land\r\nincluded; and Romans who despise these upstarts have nevertheless to fawn\r\non them. Nor again are leaders to be found in the surviving remnant of\r\nold families. It is a sad pity, but pride of birth, while indisposing\r\nthem to useful industry, does not prevent them from debauchery or from\r\ndegrading themselves in public. Financial ruin and charges of high\r\ntreason are destroying them: even were this not so, who would look\r\nto such persons for a wholesome example? Neither religion with its\r\nformalities and excitements, nor philosophy with its professors belying\r\ntheir moral preaching, could furnish the means of effecting the change of\r\nheart needed for vital reform.\r\n\r\nNo, it was not from the imperial capital, the reeking hotbed of\r\nwickedness, that any good could come. And when Juvenal turns to the\r\ncountry it is remarkable how little comfort he seems to find in the\r\nrural conditions of Italy. Like other writers, he refers to the immense\r\nestates[1260] that extended over a great part of the country, both arable\r\nand grazing lands (_saltus_), the latter in particular being of monstrous\r\nsize. We cannot get from him any hint that the land-monopoly, the canker\r\nof the later Republic, had been effectually checked. Nor indeed had\r\nit. One of the ways in which rich patrons[1261] rewarded clients for\r\nservices, honourable or (as he suggests) often dishonourable, was to give\r\nthe dependant a small landed estate. The practice was not new. Maecenas\r\nhad given Horace his Sabine farm. But the man who gave away acres must\r\nhave had plenty of acres to give. True, some of the great landlords had\r\nearned[1262] their estates by success in an honourable profession: but\r\nthe satirist is naturally more impressed by the cases of those, generally\r\nfreedmen, whose possessions are the fruit of corrupt compliance or\r\nignoble trades. These upstarts, like the Trimalchio of Petronius, live\r\nto display their wealth, and the acquisition of lands[1263] and erection\r\nof costly villas are a means to this end. The fashion set by them is\r\nfollowed by others, and over-buying and over-building are the cause of\r\nbankruptcies. Two passages[1264] indicate the continued existence of an\r\natrocious evil notorious in the earlier period of the _latifundia_, the\r\npractice of compelling small holders to part with their land by various\r\noutrages. The live stock belonging to a rich neighbour are driven on to\r\nthe poor man’s farm until the damage thus caused to his crops forces him\r\nto sell—of course at the aggressor’s price. A simpler form, ejectment\r\nwithout pretence of purchase, is mentioned as an instance of the\r\ndifficulties in the way of getting legal redress, at least for civilians.\r\nThere would be little point in mentioning such wrongs as conceivable\r\npossibilities: surely they must have occurred now and then in real life.\r\nThe truth, I take it, was that the great landlord owning a host of slaves\r\nhad always at disposal a force well able to carry out his territorial\r\nambitions; and possession of power was a temptation to use it. The\r\nemployment of slaves in rural border-raids was no new thing, and the\r\nslave, having himself nothing to lose, probably found zest in a change of\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\nIn Juvenal agriculture appears as carried on by slave labour, and the\r\nemployment of supplementary wage-earners is ignored; not unnaturally,\r\nfor it was not necessary to refer to it. The satirist himself[1265]\r\nhas rustic slaves, and is proud that they are rustic, when they on a\r\nspecial occasion come in to wait at his table in Rome. Slaves are of\r\ncourse included[1266] in the stock of an estate, great or small, given\r\nor sold. All this is commonplace: what is more to the satirist’s purpose\r\nis the mention[1267] of a member of an illustrious old family who has\r\ncome down in the world so low as to tend another man’s flocks for hire.\r\nAnd this is brought in as a contrast to the purse-proud insolence of a\r\nwealthy freedman. But more remarkable is the absence of any reference to\r\ntenant _coloni_. Even the word _colonus_ does not occur in any shade of\r\nmeaning. This too may fairly be accounted for by the fact that little\r\ncould have been got out of references to the system for the purposes of\r\nhis argument. It was, as he knew, small peasant landowners, not tenants,\r\nthat had been the backbone of old Rome; and it was this class, viewed\r\nwith the sympathetic eye of one sighing for perished glories, that he\r\nwould have liked to restore. It is a satirist’s bent to wish for the\r\nunattainable and protest against the inevitable. For himself, he can\r\nsing the praises of rustic simplicity and cheapness and denounce the\r\nluxury and extravagance of Roman society, though he dare not assail\r\nliving individuals. And in exposing the rottenness of the civilization\r\naround him he attacks the very vices that had grown to such portentous\r\nheights through the development of slavery. Idleness bore its fruit,\r\nnot only in the debauchery and gambling that fostered unholy greed and\r\ncrimes committed to procure the money that was ever vanishing, but in\r\nthe degradation of honest labour. Pampered menials were arrogant, poor\r\ncitizens servile. And vast tracts of Italian land bore witness to the\r\nmournful fact that the land system, so far from affording a sound basis\r\nfor social and economic betterment, was itself one of the worst elements\r\nof the situation.\r\n\r\nAt this stage it is well to recall the relation between agriculture and\r\nmilitary service, the farmer-soldier ideal. The long-since existing\r\ntendency for the soldier to become a professional, while the free farmer\r\nclass was decaying, had never obliterated the impression of this ideal\r\non Roman minds. The belief that gymnastic exercises on Greek models\r\nwere no effective substitute for regular manual labour in the open air\r\nas guarantees of military ‘fitness’ is still strong in Juvenal. It\r\nshews itself in his pictures of life in Rome, where such exercises were\r\npractised for the purpose of ‘keeping fit’ and ‘getting an appetite,’\r\nmuch as they are now. Followed by baths and massage and luxurious\r\nappliances of every kind, this treatment enabled the jaded city-dweller\r\nto minimize the enervating effects of idleness relieved by excitements\r\nand debauchery. He significantly lays stress on the fact that these\r\nhabits were as common among women as among men. The usual allowance must\r\nbe made for a satirist’s exaggeration; but the general truth of the\r\npicture is not to be doubted. The city life was no preparation for the\r\ncamp with its rough appliances and ever-present need for the readiness\r\nto endure cheerfully the hardships of the field. The toughness of the\r\nfarm-labourer was proverbial: the Latin word _durus_ is his conventional\r\nepithet. In other words, he was a model of healthy hardness and vigour.\r\nNow to Juvenal, as to others, the best object of desire[1268] was _mens\r\nsana in corpore sano_, and he well knew that to secure the second\r\ngave the best hope of securing the first. We might then expect him to\r\nrecommend field work as the surest way to get and keep vigorous health.\r\nYet I cannot find any indication of this precept save the advice to a\r\nfriend to get out of Rome and settle on a garden-plot in the country.\r\nHe says ‘there live devoted[1269] to your clod-pick; be the _vilicus_\r\nof a well-tended garden.’ I presume he means ‘be your own steward, and\r\nlend a hand in tillage as a steward would do.’ But an average _vilicus_\r\nwould be more concerned to get work out of his underlings than to exert\r\nhimself, and Juvenal is not very explicit in his advice, the main point\r\nbeing to get his friend out of Rome. I have reserved for comparison\r\nwith this passage one from Martial[1270]. In a couplet on a pair of\r\n_halteres_ (something rather like dumb-bells) he says ‘Why waste the\r\nstrength of arms by use of silly dumb-bells? If a man wants exercise,\r\nhe had better go and dig in a vineyard.’ This is much plainer, but one\r\nmay doubt whether it is seriously meant to be an ordinary rule of life.\r\nProbably it is no more than a sneer at gymnastic exercises. For Martial\r\nwell knew that muscle developed by the practice of athletics[1271] is\r\nvery different from the bodily firmness and capacity for continuous\r\neffort under varying conditions that is produced by a life of hard manual\r\nlabour. And the impression left on a reader’s mind by epigrammatist and\r\nsatirist alike is that in Rome and in the most favoured and accessible\r\nparts of Italy the blessing of ‘corporal soundness’ was tending to become\r\na monopoly of slaves. For when Juvenal declares[1272] that nowadays the\r\nrough _fossor_, though shackled with a heavy chain, turns up his nose at\r\nthe garden-stuff that fed a Manius Curius in the olden days, hankering\r\nafter the savoury fleshpots of the cook-shop, we need not take him too\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIII. PLINY THE YOUNGER.\r\n\r\nThe =younger Pliny=, one of the generation who remembered Vespasian,\r\nlived through the dark later years of Domitian, and rejoiced in the\r\nbetter times of Nerva and Trajan, is one of our most important witnesses.\r\nNot being a technical writer on agriculture, it was not his business\r\nto dwell on what ought to be done rather than what was being done.\r\nBeing himself a great landowner as well as a man of wide interests and\r\nhigh reputation, he knew the problems of contemporary land-management\r\nfrom experience, and speaks with intelligence and authority. He was\r\nnot a man of robust constitution, and like many others he found much\r\nrefreshment in rural sojournings. He is remarkable for keen appreciation\r\nof beautiful scenery. Adopted by his uncle, the author of the _Natural\r\nHistory_, well-educated and in touch with the literary circles and the\r\nbest social life of Rome, his letters illustrate the intellectual and\r\nmoral influences that prevailed in cultivated households of honest\r\ngentlemen. In particular he is to us perhaps the very best example\r\nof the humanizing tendency of the current philosophies of the day in\r\nrelation to the subject of slavery. He is deeply interested in promoting\r\nmanumissions[1273] whenever he gets a chance. His tender concern for the\r\nwelfare of his slaves constantly meets us, and he is only consoled for\r\nthe death of one by reflecting that the man was manumitted in time[1274]\r\nand so died free. In fact he does not regard slavery as a normally\r\nlifelong condition; and he allows his slaves to make informal wills and\r\nrespects their disposition of their savings among their fellows[1275]\r\nin the household, which is to slaves a sort of commonwealth. Masters\r\nwho don’t feel the loss of their slaves are really not human. But this\r\nall refers to domestics, and does not touch the case of the field-hand\r\ntoiling on the farm.\r\n\r\nA transaction[1276] in reference to the sale of some land by the lake\r\nof Como, Pliny’s own neighbourhood, illustrates the normal changes of\r\nownership that were going on, and his own generous nature. An old lady,\r\nan intimate friend of his mother, wanted to have a property in that\r\nlovely district. Pliny gave her the offer of any of his land at her own\r\nprice, reserving only certain parcels for sentimental reasons. Before\r\n(as it seems) any bargain was made, a friend died and left ⁵⁄₁₂ of his\r\nestate to Pliny, including some land such as the old lady desired. Pliny\r\nat once sent his freedman Hermes to offer her the suitable parcels for\r\nsale. She promptly clinched the bargain with Hermes at a figure which\r\nturned out to be only ⁷⁄₉ of the full value. Pliny’s attention was called\r\nto this, but he stood by the act of his freedman and ratified the sale.\r\nThe _publicani_ who were then farming the 5% duty on successions soon\r\nappeared, and claimed the 5% as reckoned on estimated full value of\r\nthe property. The old lady settled with them on these terms, and then\r\ninsisted on paying to Pliny the full value, not the bargained price;\r\nwhich offer he, not to be outdone, gracefully declined. Such was the\r\ncourse of a commonplace transaction, carried out by exceptional people in\r\nan unselfish spirit. We are most certainly not to suppose that this sort\r\nof thing was common in land-dealings. Another letter[1277] shews us how\r\na well-meant benefaction might fail in its aim for want of means in the\r\nbeneficiary. An old slave-woman, once Pliny’s wet-nurse, had evidently\r\nbeen manumitted, and he made her a present of a small farm (_agellum_)\r\nto provide her maintenance. At that time its market value was ample to\r\nsecure this. But things went wrong. For some reason the yearly returns\r\nfell, and the market value fell also. Whether the old woman had tried\r\nto manage it herself and failed, or whether a bad tenant had let down\r\nthe cultivation, does not plainly appear. At any rate Pliny was greatly\r\nrelieved when a friend, presumably one living near the place, undertook\r\nto direct the cultivation of the farm. He expresses his confidence that\r\nunder the new management the holding would recover its value. For his own\r\ncredit, not less than for the advantage of his nurse, he wishes to see it\r\nproduce its utmost. These little holdings no doubt needed very skilful\r\nmanagement, and I suspect that idle slaves were in this case the cause\r\nof the trouble. Slaves commonly went with land, and I do not think the\r\ngenerous donor would give his old nurse the bare land without the needful\r\nlabour. The old ‘Mammy’ could not control them, and Pliny’s friend saved\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\nTrajan’s order, requiring Provincial candidates for office to invest a\r\nthird[1278] of their property in Italian real estate, and the artificial\r\nrise of prices for the time, has been dealt with above. Pliny advised a\r\nfriend, if he would be not sorry[1279] to part with his Italian estates,\r\nto sell now at the top of the market and buy land in the Provinces,\r\nwhere prices would be correspondingly lowered. Of the risks attendant on\r\nlandowning in Italy he was well aware, and one letter[1280] on the pros\r\nand cons of a tempting purchase must be translated in full. He writes\r\nthus to a friend.\r\n\r\n‘I am doing as usual, asking your advice on a matter of business. There\r\nare now for sale some landed properties that border on farms of mine and\r\nindeed run into them. There are about them many points that tempt me, but\r\nsome equally important that repel me. The temptations are these. First,\r\nto round off my estate would be in itself an improvement. Secondly, it\r\nwould be a pleasure, and a real economy to boot, to make one trip and\r\none expense serve for a visit to both properties, to keep both under\r\nthe same[1281] legal agent, indeed almost under the same stewards, and\r\nto use only one of the granges as my furnished house, just keeping the\r\nother in repair. I am taking into account the cost of furniture, of chief\r\nservants, fancy gardeners, artisans, and even hunting[1282] outfit: for\r\nit makes a vast difference whether items like these are concentrated in\r\none spot or are scattered in separate places. On the other hand I fear\r\nit may be rash to expose so large a property to the same local climatic\r\nrisks. It seems safer to encounter the changes of fortune by not holding\r\ntoo much land in one neighbourhood. Moreover, it is a very pleasant thing\r\nto have change of scene and climate, and so too is the mere touring about\r\nfrom one of your estates to another. Then comes the chief issue on which\r\nI am trying to make up my mind. The farms are productive, the soil rich,\r\nthe water-supply good; they contain pastures, vineyards, and woodlands\r\nthat afford timber, from which there is a small but regular return. A\r\nfavoured land, you see: but it is suffering from the weakness[1283] of\r\nthose who farm it. For the late landlord several times distrained[1284]\r\non the tenants’ goods, lessening their arrears[1285] of rent for the\r\nmoment, but draining their substance for the future: the failure of this\r\nsent up the arrears once more. So they will have to be equipped[1286]\r\nwith labour; which will cost all the more because only trusty slaves\r\nwill do. As for chained slaves, I never keep them on my estates, and in\r\nthose parts nobody does. I have now only to tell you the probable price.\r\nIt is three million sesterces, though at one time it was five million:\r\nbut, what with the present scarcity[1287] of tenants and the prevailing\r\nagricultural depression, the returns from the farms have fallen, and\r\nso has the market value. You will want to know whether I can raise\r\neasily even the three millions. It is true that nearly all I have is\r\ninvested[1288] in land; still I have some money out at interest, and I\r\nshall have no trouble in borrowing. I shall get it from my mother-in-law,\r\nwho lets me use her cash as if it were my own. So pray don’t let this\r\nconsideration influence you, provided the others do not gainsay my\r\nproject; I beg you to weigh them most carefully. For of experience and\r\nforesight you have plenty and to spare as a guide in general business,\r\nparticularly in the placing of investments.’\r\n\r\nThe glimpses of agricultural conditions that we get from Pliny’s letters\r\ndo not as a rule give us a cheerful picture. Most of his land seems to\r\nhave been under vines, and the vintage[1289] was often poor, sometimes a\r\nfailure. Drought and hailstorms played havoc[1290] with the crops. When\r\nthere was a bountiful vintage, of course the wine made a poor price.\r\nHence the returns from the farms are small, and unsafe[1291] at that.\r\nSo he replies to similar complaints of friends. When he is at any of\r\nhis country places he generally has to face a chorus of grumbling[1292]\r\ntenants. He was sometimes utterly puzzled what to do. If inclined to make\r\nabatements[1293] of rent, he is uneasily aware that this remedy may only\r\nput off the evil day. If tenants do not recover their solvency (and he\r\nknows that they seldom do), he will have to change his policy[1294],\r\nfor they are ruining the land by bad husbandry. For himself, he is no\r\nfarmer. When on a country estate, watching the progress of the vintage,\r\nhe potters about[1295] in a rather purposeless manner, glad to retire to\r\nhis study where he can listen to his reader or dictate to his secretary:\r\nif he can produce[1296] a few lines, that is his crop. It would seem that\r\nnot all his farms were let to tenants. In one letter he speaks of his\r\ntown-slaves[1297] being employed as overseers or gangers of the rustic\r\nhands, and remarks that one of his occupations is to pay surprise visits\r\nto these fellows. We can guess what a drag upon Italian agriculture the\r\nslavery-system really was: here is a man full of considerate humanity,\r\ndevoted to the wellbeing of his slaves, who cannot trust one of them to\r\nsee that others do their work.\r\n\r\nBut that letting to tenants was his usual plan is evident from the\r\nnumber of his references to the trouble they gave him. It was not always\r\nclear whether to get rid of them or to keep them (and if the latter,\r\non what terms,) offered the less disastrous solution of an awkward\r\nproblem. In one letter[1298] he gives the following excuse for his\r\ninability to be present in Rome on the occasion of a friend’s succeeding\r\nto the consulship. ‘You won’t take it ill of me, particularly as I am\r\ncompelled[1299] to see to the letting of some farms, a business that\r\nmeans making an arrangement for several years, and will drive me to adopt\r\na fresh policy. For in the five years[1300] just past the arrears have\r\ngrown, in spite of large abatements granted. Hence most (of the tenants)\r\ntake no further trouble to reduce their liabilities, having lost hope of\r\never meeting them in full: they grab and use up everything that grows,\r\nreckoning that henceforth it is not they[1301] who would profit by\r\neconomy. So as the evils increase I must find remedies to meet them. And\r\nthe only possible plan is to let these farms[1302] not at a cash rent but\r\non shares, and then to employ some of my staff as task-masters to watch\r\nthe crops. Besides, there is no fairer source of income than the returns\r\nrendered by soil climate and season. True, this plan requires mighty\r\nhonesty, keen eyes, and a host of hands. Still I must make the trial;\r\nI must act as in a chronic malady, and use every possible treatment to\r\npromote a change.’\r\n\r\nNo doubt there were many landlords more effectively qualified to wring\r\nan income out of rustic estates than this delicate and gentle literary\r\nman. Indeed he knew this himself and made no secret of it. Writing to a\r\nfriend[1303] he says ‘When others go to visit their estates, it is to\r\ncome back the richer; when I do so, it is to come back the poorer for the\r\ntrip.’ He then tells the story of a recent experience. He had disposed of\r\nthe year’s vintage on some estate (evidently the hanging crop) by auction\r\nto some speculative buyers, who were tempted by the apparent prospects\r\nof a rise in price to follow. Things did not turn out as expected, and\r\nPliny felt bound to make some abatement in the covenanted price. Whether\r\nthis was simply owing to his own scrupulous love of fair dealing, or\r\nwhether some stipulation in the contract of sale had automatically become\r\noperative, does not seem quite clear: I should give him the benefit of\r\nthe doubt. How to make the abatement equitably, so as to treat each case\r\nwith perfect fairness, was a difficult problem. For, as he shews at\r\nlength, the circumstances of different cases differed widely, and a mere\r\n‘flat rate’ remission of so much per cent all round would not have worked\r\nout so as to give equal relief to all. After careful calculation he\r\ndevised a scheme that satisfied his conscientious wish to act fairly by\r\neach and all. Of course this left him a large sum out of pocket, but he\r\nthought that the general approval of the neighbourhood and the gratitude\r\nof the relieved speculators were well worth the money. For to have a good\r\nname among the local dealers was good business for the future. Many an\r\nhonest gentleman since Pliny’s time has similarly consoled himself for\r\nhis losses of honour, and some of them have not missed their well-earned\r\nrecompense.\r\n\r\nAmong his many country properties, a certain Tuscan _villa_ was one\r\nof his favourite resorts. In a long description of it and its various\r\nattractions he mentions[1304] incidentally that the Tiber, which ran\r\nright through the estate, was available for barges in winter and spring,\r\nand thus enabled them to send their farm-produce by water-carriage to\r\nRome. This confirms the evidence of other writers, as does also the\r\nletter describing the widespread devastation[1305] caused by a Tiber\r\nflood. More notable as throwing light on conditions of life in rural\r\nItaly is a letter[1306] in reply to a correspondent who had written to\r\ninform him of the disappearance of a Roman of position and property when\r\non a journey, apparently in the Tiber country. The man was known to have\r\nreached Ocriculum, but after that all trace of him was lost. Pliny had\r\nsmall hopes from the inquiry that it was proposed to conduct. He cites\r\na similar case from his own acquaintance years before. A fellow-burgess\r\nof Comum had got military promotion as centurion through the influence\r\nof Pliny, who made him a present of money when he set out, apparently\r\nfor Rome, to take up his office. Nothing more was ever heard of him.\r\nBut Pliny adds that in this case, as in the one just reported, the\r\nslaves escorting their master also disappeared. Therefore he leaves it\r\nan open question, whether[1307] the slaves murdered their master and\r\nescaped undetected, or whether the whole party on either occasion were\r\nmurdered by a robber band. The lack of a regular constabulary in Italy\r\nhad been, and still was, a grave defect in Roman administration. To\r\naccount for this neglect we must remember that rich men always relied on\r\ntheir slave-escort for protection. If the poor man travelled, he was not\r\nworth[1308] robbing; his danger was the chance of being kidnapped and\r\nsold for a slave, and we have seen that some of the early emperors tried\r\nto put down this abuse. The danger to a traveller from his own slaves was\r\nperhaps greater on a journey than at home; but it was of the same kind,\r\ninseparable from slavery, and was most cruelly dealt with by the law.\r\nMeanwhile brigandage seems never to have been thoroughly extinguished in\r\nItaly or the Provinces[1309].\r\n\r\nIn spite of these drawbacks to life and movement in a great slave-holding\r\ncommunity, there is nothing that strikes a reader more in Pliny’s\r\nletters than the easy acceptance of present conditions. Under Trajan the\r\nempire seemed so secure and strong, that unpleasant occurrences could\r\nbe regarded as only of local importance. That the free population of\r\nItaly could no longer defend in arms what their forefathers had won, was\r\nmanifest. But custom was making it seem natural to rely on armies raised\r\nin the Provinces; all the more so perhaps as emperors were being supplied\r\nby Spain. That slavery itself was one of the cankers that were eating\r\nout the vitality of the Roman empire, does not seem to have occurred to\r\nPliny or other writers of the day. Philosophers had got so far as to\r\nprotest against its worst abuses and vindicate the claims of a common\r\nhumanity. Christian apostles, in the circles reached by them, preached\r\nalso obedience[1310] and an honesty above eye-service as the virtues of a\r\nslave. But in both of these contrasted doctrines the teachers were mainly\r\nif not exclusively thinking of domestics, not of farm-hands. There was\r\nhowever one imperial department in which the distinction between slave\r\nand free still rigidly followed old traditional rules; and it was one\r\nmuch more likely to have to deal with cases of rustic slaves than of\r\ndomestics. This was the army. The immemorial rule, that no slave could\r\nbe a soldier, had never been broken save under the pressure of a few\r\ngreat temporary emergencies, or by the evasions incident to occasions\r\nof civil warfare. It still remained in force. When Pliny was governor\r\nof the Province of Bithynia and Pontus he had to deal with a question\r\narising out of this rule. Recruiting was in progress, and two slaves\r\nwere discovered among the men enlisted. They had already taken the\r\nmilitary oath, but were not yet embodied in any corps. Pliny reported\r\nthe case[1311] to Trajan, and asked for instructions. The emperor sent a\r\ncareful answer. ‘If they were called up (_lecti_), then the recruiting\r\nofficer did wrong: if they were furnished as substitutes[1312] (_vicarii\r\ndati_), the fault is with those who sent them: but if they presented\r\nthemselves as volunteers, well knowing[1313] their disqualification, they\r\nmust be punished. That they are not as yet embodied, matters little. For\r\nthey were bound to have given a true account of their extraction on the\r\nday when they came up for inspection.’ What came of it we do not know.\r\nBut it is no rash guess that the prospect of escaping into the ranks of\r\nthe army would be attractive[1314] to a sturdy rustic slave, and that\r\na recruiting officer might ask few questions when he saw a chance of\r\ngetting exceptionally fine recruits. Probably the two detected suffered\r\nthe capital penalty. Such was still the rigid attitude of the great\r\nsoldier-emperor, determined not to confess the overstraining of the\r\nempire’s man-power. But the time was not far distant when Marcus, beset\r\nby the great pestilence and at his wits’ end for an army of defence,\r\nwould enrol slaves[1315] and ruffians of any kind to fight for Rome.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to cite the numerous references in the letters to\r\nslaves and slavery that are not connected with agriculture. Nor need\r\nI pursue in detail the circumstances of one of his generous public\r\nbenefactions, the alimentary endowment[1316] for freeborn children,\r\nprobably at Comum. It has been mentioned in another chapter, and its\r\nchief point of interest is in the elaborate machinery employed to secure\r\nthe perpetuity of the charity. To leave money to the municipality was\r\nto risk its being squandered. To leave them land meant that the estate\r\nwould not be carefully managed. What he did was to convey[1317] the\r\nproperty in some land to a representative of the burgesses, and to take\r\nit back subject to a rent-charge considerably less than the yearly value\r\nof the land. Thus the endowment was safe, for the margin allowed would\r\nensure that the land would not be allowed to drop out of cultivation. An\r\ninteresting glimpse of municipal patriotism, active and passive. The only\r\nother detail I have to note is that he regularly uses the term _colonus_\r\nas ‘tenant-farmer.’ I have not found a single instance of the older sense\r\n‘tiller of the soil.’ We cannot argue from Pliny to his contemporaries\r\nwithout some reserve, for he was undoubtedly an exceptional man. But, so\r\nfar as his evidence goes, it bears out the view that great landlords were\r\ngiving up the system of slave stewardships for free tenancies. Owners\r\nthere still were who kept their estates in hand, farming themselves or\r\nby deputy for their own account. But that some of these were men of a\r\nhumbler class, freedmen to wit, we have seen reason to believe from\r\nreferences in the elder Pliny. Perhaps they were many, and some may even\r\nhave worked with their own hands. Be this as it may, slave labour[1318]\r\nwas still the staple appliance of agriculture, and whenever there were\r\nslaves for sale there were always buyers.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIV. SUETONIUS AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\n=Suetonius=, whose Lives of the first twelve emperors contain much\r\ninteresting and important matter, stands in relation to the present\r\ninquiry on the same footing as most of the regular historians. He\r\nflourished in the times of Trajan and Hadrian, and therefore what remains\r\nof his writings is not contemporary evidence. But he was a student and\r\na careful compiler from numerous works now lost. The number of passages\r\nin which he refers to matters directly or indirectly bearing on rustic\r\nlife and labour is not large, and most of them have been cited in other\r\nchapters, where they find a place in connexion with the context. He can\r\nbe dealt with very briefly here.\r\n\r\nThe close connexion between wars and the supply of slaves is marked\r\nin the doings of Julius[1319] Caesar. Gaulish and British captives\r\nwere (as Caesar himself records) no small part of the booty won in his\r\nnorthern campaigns. He rewarded his men after a victory with a prisoner\r\napiece: these would soon be sold to the dealers who followed the army,\r\nand most of them would find their way to the Roman slave-market. To\r\ngratify friendly princes or provincial communities, he sent them large\r\nbodies of slaves as presents. So his victims served instead of cash\r\nto win adherents for their new master. And these natives of the North\r\nwould certainly be used for heavy rough work, mostly as farm-hands.\r\nWhen Augustus, loth to enlarge the empire, felt constrained to teach\r\nrestless tribes a lesson, he imposed a reserve-condition[1320] on the\r\nsale of prisoners taken: they were not to be employed in districts near\r\ntheir old homes, and not to be manumitted before thirty years. Most\r\nof these would probably also be brought to Italy for the same kind of\r\nservice. Yet, as we have seen, there was kidnapping[1321] of freemen in\r\nItaly; probably a sign that slaves were already become dear. That their\r\nnumbers had been reduced in the civil wars, not only by death but by\r\nmanumission, is fairly certain. In the war with Sextus Pompeius it was\r\nfound necessary[1322] to manumit 20,000 slaves to serve as oarsmen in the\r\nfleet. Suetonius also records that Augustus when emperor had trouble with\r\nthe unwillingness of Romans to be called up for military duty. He had\r\nto deal sharply[1323] with an _eques_ who cut off the thumbs of his two\r\nsons to incapacitate them. The abuse of the public corn-doles was a grave\r\nevil. Men got rid of the burden of maintaining old slaves by manumitting\r\nthem and so making them, as freedmen-citizens, entitled to a share of the\r\ndoles. This was shifting the burden of feeding useless mouths on to the\r\nstate. Augustus saw that the vast importation of corn for this bounty\r\ntended to discourage[1324] Italian agriculture, and thought of abolishing\r\nthe whole system of _frumentationes_. But he had to give up the project,\r\nbeing convinced that the system would be restored. He really desired to\r\nrevive agriculture, and it was surely with this aim that he advanced\r\ncapital sums[1325] to landlords free of interest on good security for\r\nthe principal. The growth of humane sentiment toward slaves is marked\r\nby the ordinance of Claudius[1326] against some very cruel practices of\r\nslaveowners. And we are reminded that penal servitude was now a regular\r\ninstitution in the Roman empire by Nero’s order[1327] for bringing\r\nprisoners from all parts to carry out some colossal works in Italy, and\r\nfor fixing condemnation to hard labour as the normal penalty of crime.\r\n\r\nIn the Lives of the three Flavian emperors there are one or two passages\r\nof interest. At this distance of time it is not easy to appreciate the\r\neffect on the sentiments of Roman society of the extinction of the\r\nJulio-Claudian house, and the accession of a thoroughly plebeian one,\r\nresting on the support of the army and readily accepted by the Provinces.\r\nSuetonius, like Tacitus, was near enough to the revolutionary year 69 AD\r\nto understand the momentous nature of the crises that brought Vespasian\r\nto the head of affairs. He takes pains to describe[1328] the descent of\r\nthe new emperor from a Sabine family of no remarkable distinction. For\r\ntwo generations they had combined with fair success the common Roman\r\nprofessions of military service and finance. They were respectable\r\npeople of good local standing. But there was another story relative to a\r\ngeneration further back. It was said that Vespasian’s greatgrandfather\r\n(this takes us back to Republican days) had been a contractor[1329] for\r\nrustic labour. He was a headman or ‘boss’ of working-parties such as\r\nare wont to pass year after year from Umbria into the Sabine country\r\nto serve as farm-labourers. Of this story Suetonius could not discover\r\nany confirmation. But that there had been, and perhaps still was, some\r\nsuch supply of migratory labour available, is a piece of evidence not\r\nto be ignored. Vespasian himself was a soldier who steadily rose in the\r\nusual official career till he reached the coveted post of governor of\r\nAfrica. After a term of honest but undistinguished rule, he came back\r\nno richer than he went, indeed he was very nearly bankrupt. He was\r\ndriven to mortgage all his landed estate, and to become for a time a\r\nslave-dealer[1330], in order to live in the style that his official rank\r\nrequired. The implied disgrace of resorting to a gainful but socially\r\ndespised trade is at least evidence of the continual demand for human\r\nchattels. Of two acts of Domitian[1331], his futile ordinance to check\r\nvine-growing, and his grant of the remaining odd remnants of Italian land\r\nto present occupants, enough has been said above.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to collect the numerous passages in writers of\r\nthis period that illustrate the growing change of view as to slavery\r\nin general. The point made by moralists, that moral bondage is more\r\ndegrading than physical (for the latter need not be really degrading),\r\ncame with not less force from Epictetus the slave than from Seneca\r\nthe noble Roman. It is however worth while just to note the frequent\r\nreferences to cases of philosophers and other distinguished literary men\r\nwho had either actually been slaves or had at some time in their lives\r\nbeen forced to earn their daily bread by bodily labour. Such cases are,\r\nCleanthes[1332] drawing water for wages, Plautus[1333] hired by the baker\r\nto grind at his mill, and Protagoras[1334] earning his living as a common\r\nporter. In one passage several slaves[1335] are enumerated who became\r\nphilosophers. Now, what is the significance of these and other references\r\nof the same import? I suggest that they have just the same bearing as\r\nthe general principles of common humanity argumentatively pressed by the\r\nStoic and other schools of thought. The sermonizing of Seneca is a good\r\nspecimen. But discussion of principles in the abstract was never the\r\nstrong point of Roman society, and citation of concrete instances would\r\nserve to give reality to views that were only too often regarded as the\r\nvisionary speculations of chattering Greeks. That Roman authors, down\r\nto the last age of Roman literature, expressed the longing for a more\r\nwholesome state of agriculture by everlasting references to Cincinnatus\r\nand the rest of the traditional rustic heroes, is another recognition\r\nof this method. The notion that courage and contempt of death could be\r\nfostered by the spectacle of gladiators rested on much the same basis.\r\nTrue, there is nothing in the above considerations that directly bears\r\nupon rustic labour as such: but hints that ‘a man’s a man for a’ that’\r\nare not to be ignored when they make their appearance in the midst of a\r\nslave-holding society.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLV. APULEIUS.\r\n\r\nThe Province of Africa was in this period a flourishing part of the\r\nempire, giving signs of its coming importance in the next generation,\r\nwhen it produced several emperors. It was in fact a sort of successor of\r\nSpain, and like Spain it enjoyed the advantage of not fronting on the\r\nusual seats of war to the North and East. One of the most remarkable\r\nliterary figures of the age was the African[1336] =L Apuleius= of\r\nMadaura, who travelled widely as student and lecturer, and was well\r\nacquainted with Greece and Italy. A philosopher of the mystical-Platonist\r\ntype, he was in touch with practical life through his study of the Law,\r\nand was for some time a pleader in Rome. His native Province[1337] was\r\nnotoriously addicted to litigation, and a modern scholar[1338] has shewn\r\nthat the works of Apuleius abound in legal phraseology and are coloured\r\nwith juristic notions. Now, it was not possible to go far in considering\r\nproperty and rights without coming upon questions relative to land:\r\nmoreover, he himself owned land in Africa. Accordingly we find in him\r\nsome references to land, and even to rustic labour and conditions of\r\nrural life. And, though his _Metamorphoses_ is a fantastic romance, there\r\nis no reason to doubt that incidents and scenes (other than supernatural)\r\nare true to facts observed by the writer, and therefore admissible as\r\nevidence of a general kind. An instance may be found in the case of\r\nthe ass, that is the hero of the story transformed into that shape by\r\nmagic. He is to be sold, and the waggish auctioneer[1339] says to a\r\npossible bidder ‘I am well aware that it is a criminal offence to sell\r\nyou a Roman citizen for a slave: but why not buy a good and trusty slave\r\nthat will serve you as a helper both at home and abroad?’ Here we have\r\na recognition of the fact of kidnapping, which is referred to elsewhere\r\nin the book; that in cases of Roman victims the law took a very serious\r\nview of the offence; while the point of the pleasantry lies in the\r\ncircumstance that neither auctioneer nor company present are aware that\r\nthe ass is a transformed man, liable to regain his human shape by magical\r\ndisenchantment.\r\n\r\nThe scene of the _Metamorphoses_ is laid in Greece, and the anecdotes\r\nincluded in it do not give us a favourable picture of that part of\r\nthe Roman empire. There was surely nothing to tempt the writer to\r\nmisrepresent the condition of the country by packing his descriptions\r\nwith unreal details: he would thus have weakened the effect of his\r\nromance. Wealth in the hands of a few, surrounded by a pauper majority;\r\nshrunken towns, each with its more or less degraded rabble; general\r\ninsecurity for life liberty and property; a cruel and arbitrary use\r\nof power; a spiritless acquiescence in this pitiful state of things,\r\nrelieved by the excitements of superstition and obscenity: such was\r\nRoman Greece as Apuleius saw it. No doubt there was Roman Law to enforce\r\nhonesty and order. But the administration of justice seldom, if ever,\r\nreaches the standard of legislation; and as yet the tendency of the Roman\r\ngovernment was to interfere as little as possible with local authorities.\r\nGreece in particular had always been treated with special indulgence, in\r\nrecognition of her glorious past. Whether the effects of this favour were\r\nconducive to the wellbeing of the country, may fairly be doubted. The\r\ninsane vanity of Nero, masquerading as Liberator of Greece, had surely\r\ndone more harm than good. Hadrian’s benefactions to Athens, dictated\r\nby sentimental antiquarianism, could not improve the general condition\r\nof the country, however satisfactory they might be to what was now an\r\nUniversity town living on students and tourists.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things that strikes a reader of this book is the\r\nmatter-of-fact way in which brigandage[1340] is taken for granted.\r\nThese robbers work in organized bands under chosen captains, have\r\nregular strongholds as bases of operations, draw recruits from the\r\npoverty-stricken peasantry or slaves, and do not hesitate to attack\r\nand plunder great mansions, relying on the cowardice or indifference\r\n(or perhaps treachery) of the rich owner’s slaves. Murder is to them\r\na mere trifle, and their ingenuity in torturing is fiendish. No doubt\r\ntheir activities are somewhat exaggerated as a convenient part of the\r\nmachinery of the story, but the lament of Plutarch and the Euboic idyll\r\nof Dion forbid us to regard these brigand-scenes as pure fiction.\r\nThey are another side of the same picture of distressful Greece. Nor\r\nis the impression produced thereby at all weakened by a specimen of\r\nmilitary[1341] insolence. Greece was not a Province in which a large\r\narmy was kept, but all Governors had some armed force to support their\r\nauthority. The story introduces the ass with his present owner, a\r\ngardener, on his back. They are met by a swaggering bully of a soldier,\r\nwho inquires where they are going. He asks this in Latin. The gardener\r\nmakes no reply, not knowing Latin. The angry soldier knocks him off the\r\nass, and repeats his question in Greek. On being told that they are\r\non their way to the nearest town, he seizes the ass on the pretext of\r\nbeing wanted for fatigue duty in the service of the Governor, and will\r\nlisten to no entreaties. Just as he is preparing to break the gardener’s\r\nskull, the gardener trips him up and pounds him to some purpose. He shams\r\ndead, while the gardener hurries off and takes refuge with a friend in\r\nthe town. The soldier follows, and stirs up his mates, who induce the\r\nlocal magistrates to take up the matter and give them satisfaction. The\r\ngardener’s retreat is betrayed by a neighbour, and clever concealment\r\nnullified by an indiscretion of the ass. The wretched gardener is found\r\nand haled off to prison awaiting execution, while the soldier takes\r\npossession of the ass. This story again is surely not grotesque and\r\nincredible fiction. More likely it is made up from details heard by\r\nthe African during his sojourn in Greece. If scenes of this kind were\r\npossible, the outlook of humble rustics[1342] can hardly have been a\r\ncheerful one.\r\n\r\nThat perils of robbers and military insolence were not the only troubles\r\nof the countryside, is shewn by the following anecdote[1343] describing\r\nthe brutal encroachments of a big landlord on poorer neighbours.\r\nA landowner, apparently a man of moderate means, had three sons,\r\nwell-educated and well-behaved youths, who were close friends of a poor\r\nman with a little cottage of his own. Bordering on this man’s little\r\nholding was the large and fertile landed estate belonging to a rich and\r\npowerful neighbour in the prime of life. This rich man, turning the fame\r\nof his ancestors to bad account, strong in the support of party cliques,\r\nin fact an autocrat[1344] within the jurisdiction of the town, was given\r\nto making raids on the poverty of his humble neighbour. He slaughtered\r\nhis flocks, drove off his oxen, and trampled down his crops before they\r\nwere ripe, till he had robbed him of all the fruit of his thrift. His\r\nnext desire was to expel him altogether from his patch of soil: so he\r\ngot up a baseless dispute over boundaries, and claimed the whole of the\r\nland as his own. The poor man, though diffident by nature, was bent upon\r\nkeeping his hereditary ground if only for his own burial. The claim\r\nupset him greatly, and he entreated a number of his friends to attend at\r\nthe settlement[1345] of boundaries. Among those present were the three\r\nbrothers mentioned above, who came to do their little best in the cause\r\nof their injured friend. But the rich man, unabashed by the presence\r\nof a number of citizens, treated all efforts at conciliation with open\r\ncontempt, and swore that he would order his slaves to pick the poor man\r\nup by the ears and chuck him ever so far from his cottage in less than\r\nno time. The bystanders were greatly incensed at this brutal utterance.\r\nOne of the three brothers dared to say ‘It’s no good your bullying and\r\nthreatening like this just because you are a man of influence; don’t\r\nforget that even poor[1346] men have found in the laws guarding freemen’s\r\nrights a protector against the outrages of the rich.’ Upon this the\r\nenraged tyrant let loose his ferocious dogs[1347] and set them on the\r\ncompany. A horrible scene followed. One of the three youths was torn to\r\npieces, and the others also perished; one of them slain by the rich man\r\nhimself, the other, after avenging his brother, by his own hand.\r\n\r\nThe mere aggression of the rich landlord on the poor is interesting as\r\nadding another instance of the encroachments to the occurrence of which\r\nmany other writers testify. The most remarkable feature of the story is\r\nthe insolent disregard of the Law shewn by the rich man from first to\r\nlast. That the governor of the Province could prevent or punish such\r\noutrages, if his attention were called to them, is not to be doubted.\r\nBut he could not be everywhere at once, and it is not likely that many\r\nof the poorer class would be forward to report such doings and appear\r\nas accusers of influential persons. The rich probably sympathized with\r\ntheir own class, and a poor man shrank from a criminal prosecution that\r\nwould in any event expose him to their vengeance afterwards. True, the\r\npoor were the majority. But it was a very old principle of Roman policy\r\nto entrust the effective control of municipalities to the burgesses of\r\nproperty, men who had something to lose and who, being a minority, would\r\nearn their local supremacy by a self-interested obedience to the central\r\ngovernment. Thus local magnates (their evil day was not yet come) were\r\nleft very much to their own devices, and most provincial governors cared\r\ntoo much for their own ease and comfort to display an inquisitive zeal.\r\nMoreover, so far as the rich thought it judicious to keep the poorer\r\ncontented, it would be the town rabble that profited chiefly if not\r\nexclusively by their liberalities: the more isolated rustic was more\r\nliable to suffer from their land-proud greediness. We must picture them\r\nas overbearing and arbitrary slaveholders, practically uncontrolled; and\r\nthe worst specimens among them as an ever-present terror to a cowed and\r\nindigent peasantry. We are not to suppose that things were as bad as this\r\nin all parts of Greece, but that there was little or nothing to prevent\r\ntheir becoming so, even in happier districts.\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial the Greek tendency had been to congregate in towns,\r\nand after the early fall of the landowning aristocracies this tendency\r\nwas strengthened by democratic movements. The country as a whole was\r\nnever able to feed its population. But the population was now greatly\r\nreduced. Given due security, perhaps the rustics might now have been able\r\nto feed the towns. And that they were to some extent doing so may be\r\ninferred from the fact that the chief peasant figure in the rural life\r\nof the _Metamorphoses_ is the market-gardener[1348]. If he is but left\r\nin peace, he seems to be doing fairly well. It is natural at this point\r\nto inquire whether a _hortulanus_ might not also be a _colonus_, the\r\nformer name connoting his occupation and the latter his legal position in\r\nrelation to the land. Both terms often occur, but they seem to be quite\r\ndistinct: I can find nothing to justify the application of both to the\r\nsame person. And yet I cannot feel certain that Apuleius always means a\r\ntenant-farmer[1349] under a landlord whenever he uses the word _colonus_.\r\nProbably he does, as Norden seems to think. In any case the gardener is\r\nevidently in a smaller way of business than the average _colonus_, and it\r\nmay be that his little scrap of land is his own. He certainly works[1350]\r\nwith his own hands, and I find nothing to suggest that he is an employer\r\nof slaves, or that he himself is not free. That the tenant-farmers were\r\noften _coloni partiarii_, bound to deliver to their landlord a fixed\r\nshare of their produce in kind, is highly probable. But this does not\r\nexclude the payment of money rents as well. Local usage probably varied\r\nin different districts. It is true that Apuleius several times[1351]\r\nuses _partiarius_ metaphorically, but this only shews his addiction to\r\nlegal language, and is no proof of the prevalence of the share-system in\r\nGreece. The _coloni_, nominally free, were as yet only bound to the soil\r\nby the practical difficulty of clearing themselves from the obligations\r\nthat encumbered them and checked freedom of movement. But they were now\r\nnear to the time when they were made fixtures by law.\r\n\r\nAnother work of Apuleius furnishes matter of interest, the so-called\r\n_Apologia_, a speech in his own defence when tried on a charge of\r\nmagical arts about the year 158 AD. That the accused was in no little\r\ndanger from this criminal prosecution has been shewn[1352] by Norden.\r\nWhat concerns us is the reference to rustic affairs that the speaker\r\nis led to make in the course of his argument, when demolishing some of\r\nthe allegations of his enemies. The trial was in Africa at the regular\r\nprovincial assize, and the conditions referred to are African. Apuleius,\r\nas a man of note in his native Province, takes high ground to manifest\r\nhis confidence in the strength of his case. The prosecution want to draw\r\nhim into an unseemly squabble over side-issues. As the chief alleged\r\ninstance of his magic was connected with his marriage to a rich lady, a\r\nwidow of mature age, whom he was said to have bewitched, being at the\r\ntime a young man in need, it had evidently been thought necessary to\r\ndiscuss his financial position as throwing light upon his motives. If\r\nat the same time he could be represented as having acted in defiance of\r\nwell-known laws, so much the better. If we may trust the bold refutation\r\nof Apuleius, they entangled themselves in a contradiction and betrayed\r\ntheir own blind malice. His reply[1353] is as follows. ‘Whether you keep\r\nslaves to cultivate your farm, or whether you have an arrangement with\r\nyour neighbours for exchange[1354] of labour, I do not know and do not\r\nwant to know. But you (profess to) know that at Oea, on the same day,\r\nI manumitted three slaves: this was one of the things you laid to my\r\ncharge, and your counsel brought it up against me, though a moment before\r\nhe had said that when I came to Oea I had with me but a single slave.\r\nNow, will you have the goodness to explain how, having but one, I could\r\nmanumit three,—unless this too is an effect of magic. Was there ever\r\nsuch monstrous lying, whether from blindness or force of habit? He says,\r\nApuleius brought one slave with him to Oea. Then, after babbling a few\r\nwords, he adds that Apuleius manumitted three in one day at Oea. If he\r\nhad said that I brought with me three, and granted freedom to them all,\r\neven that would not have deserved[1355] belief. But, suppose I had done\r\nso, what then? would not three freedmen be as sure a mark of wealth as\r\nthree slaves of indigence?’\r\n\r\nAfter this outburst the speaker is at pains to point out that to do\r\nwith few slaves is a philosopher’s part, commended by examples not of\r\nphilosophers only but of men famed in Roman history. The well-worn topic\r\nof the schools, that to need little is true riches, is set forth at\r\nlarge, with instances in illustration. He then asserts[1356] that he\r\ninherited a considerable property from his father, which has been much\r\nreduced by the cost of his journeys and expenses as a student and gifts\r\nto deserving friends. After this he turns upon his adversary. ‘But you\r\nand the men of your uneducated rustic class are worth just what your\r\nproperty is worth and no more, like trees that bear no fruit and are\r\nworth only the value of the timber in their stems. Henceforth you had\r\nbetter not taunt any man with his poverty. Your father left you nothing\r\nbut a tiny farm at Zarat, and it is but the other day that you were\r\ntaking the opportunity of a shower of rain to give it a good ploughing\r\nwith the help of a single ass, and made it a three-days[1357] job. What\r\nhas kept you on your legs is the quite recent windfalls of inheritances\r\nfrom kinsmen who died one after another.’ These personalities, in the\r\ntrue vein of ancient advocacy, do not tell us much, but it is interesting\r\nto note that the skilled pleader, a distinguished man of the world, quite\r\nnaturally sneers at his opponent for having been a poor working farmer.\r\nWhether this was an especially effective taunt in the Province Africa,\r\nthe home of great estates, it is hardly possible to guess.\r\n\r\nOf small farmers in Africa, working their own land, we have, probably by\r\naccident, hardly any other record. But the reference above, to neighbours\r\ntaking turns to help one another on their farms, comes in so much as a\r\nmatter of course that we may perhaps conclude that there were such small\r\nfree farmers, at least in some parts of the Province. For slaves we need\r\nno special evidence. But the lady whom Apuleius had married seems to\r\nhave been a large slaveowner as well as a large landowner. He declares\r\nthat he with difficulty persuaded her to quiet the claims of her sons by\r\nmaking over to them a great part of her estate in land and other goods;\r\nand one item consists[1358] of 400 slaves. We have also a reference to\r\n_ergastula_ in a passage where he is protesting that to charge him with\r\npractising magic arts with the privity of fifteen slaves is on the face\r\nof it ridiculous[1359]. ‘Why, 15 free men make a community, 15 slaves\r\nmake a household, and 15 chained ones a lock-up.’ I take these _vincti_\r\nto be troublesome slaves, not debtors. Again, in refuting the suggestion\r\nthat he had bewitched the lady, he states as proof of her sanity that\r\nat the very time when she is said to have been out of her mind she most\r\nintelligently audited and passed the accounts of her stewards[1360] and\r\nother head-servants on her estates. And in general it has been well\r\nsaid[1361] that Apuleius, with all his wide interest in all manner of\r\nthings, did not feel driven to inquire into the right or wrong of slavery\r\nin itself. He took it as he found it in the Roman world of his day. That\r\nhe had eyes to see some of its most obvious horrors, may be inferred from\r\nthe description[1362] of the condition of slaves in a flour-mill, put\r\ninto the mouth of the man-ass. But with the humanitarian movements of\r\nthese times he shews no sympathy; and he can depict abominable scenes of\r\ncruelty and bestiality without any warmth of serious indignation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMODUS TO DIOCLETIAN\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVI. GENERAL INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nThe death of Marcus Aurelius in 180 AD brings us to the beginning of a\r\nlong period of troubles, in which the growing weakness of the empire\r\nwas exposed, the principate-system of Augustus finally failed under the\r\npredominance of military power, and the imperial government was left\r\nto be reorganized by Diocletian on a more Oriental model. There is no\r\ndoubt that during some hundred years the internal wellbeing of the Roman\r\nempire was being lowered, and that the parts most open to barbarian\r\ninvasion suffered terribly. But the pressure of taxation to supply\r\nmilitary needs bore heavily on all parts and impaired the vitality of the\r\nwhole. Reactions there were now and then, when a strong man, or even a\r\nwell-meaning one, became emperor and had a few years in which to combat\r\npresent evils and for the moment check them. But the average duration\r\nof reigns was very brief; emperors were generally murdered or slain in\r\nbattle; from 249 to 283 the chief function of an emperor was to lead\r\nhis army against barbarian invaders. It is a remarkable fact that the\r\nfirst half of this unhappy century was the classical period of Roman\r\njurisprudence. The important post of Praetorian Prefect, which began with\r\na dignified military command and was more and more becoming the chief\r\nministry of the Empire, was again and again held by eminent jurists. But\r\nin the long run the civil power could not stand against the jealousy of\r\nthe military, and the murder of Ulpian in 228 practically ends the series\r\nof great lawyer-ministers, leaving the sword in undisputed control. The\r\nauthorities for this century of troubles are meagre and unsatisfactory.\r\nWith the help of contemporary inscriptions, modern writers are able to\r\ncompose some sort of a history of the times, so far as public events and\r\ngovernmental activities are concerned. But the literature of private\r\nlife, the source of our best evidence on agricultural labour, is for the\r\ntime at an end, and the facts of farm life were not of the kind thought\r\nworthy of record in inscriptions.\r\n\r\nThere is therefore nothing to be done but to glean the few scraps of\r\ninformation that in any way bear upon the condition of tillers of the\r\nsoil in this period. They are as a rule of little value, and they come\r\nfrom writers of little authority. But it is something if they are of a\r\npiece with the general record of these unhappy times. Even the imperial\r\nbiographies of Marius Maximus survive only in the meagre abstracts of\r\nlater writers, and modern historians are quite unable to reconstruct any\r\nclear picture of the inner life of the period 180-284 AD owing to the\r\nlack of materials.\r\n\r\nThe most significant piece of information relates to Pertinax. We are\r\ntold[1363] that one of the useful reforms contemplated by him was the\r\nreclamation of waste lands throughout the empire. He ordained that any\r\none might occupy derelict lands, even on the imperial estates: on careful\r\ncultivation thereof, the farmer was to become owner[1364]. For a space of\r\nten years he was to be exempt from all taxation, and his ownership was to\r\nbe guaranteed against future disturbance. This passage is good evidence\r\nof the decay of agriculture, agreeing with what we have learnt from other\r\nsources. But we cannot gather from it that the well-meant design had\r\nany practical effect. Pertinax was only emperor for the inside of three\r\nmonths, and could not realize his virtuous aspirations. About 80 years\r\nlater we find Aurelian[1365] planning the development of waste lands\r\nin Etruria, and Probus[1366] giving allotments in the wilds of Isauria\r\nto his veterans as settlers with obligation of military service. There\r\ncan be little doubt that the depopulation and decline of cultivation,\r\nmade sadly manifest in the calamitous times of Marcus Aurelius, had\r\nnever ceased to undermine the vital forces of the empire. How to fill up\r\ndeserted lands, and make them productive of food and revenue, was the\r\nproblem that every serious ruler had to face. And there was in fact only\r\none resource available to meet the need. The native population of the\r\nempire, stationary at best, had been further reduced by pestilence and\r\nfamine, and was not able to fill up the spaces laid waste by frontier\r\nwars. Hence the policy of bringing in masses of barbarians, adopted by\r\nMarcus, had to be repeated again and again.\r\n\r\nWe must not confuse these settlements with the immigrations of conquering\r\ntribes that occurred later. Rome was still superior to her adversaries\r\nin military organization and skill, and under fairly equal conditions\r\nable to defeat them in pitched battles. Thus Claudius II gained great\r\nvictories over the Goths, and the biographer[1367] tells us of the\r\nsequel. ‘The Roman provinces were filled with barbarian slaves and\r\nScythian tillers of the soil. The Goth was turned into a settler on the\r\nbarbarian frontier. There was not a single district but had some Gothic\r\nslave whose bondage attested the triumph.’ Here we seem to have the echo\r\nof a somewhat boastful contemporary version. The mention of both slaves\r\nand frontier colonists is to be noted. We have no statistics to guide us\r\nin an attempt to estimate the relative numbers of the two classes. But\r\nthe settlement of defeated barbarians on the frontier as Roman subjects\r\nis clearly regarded as a worthy achievement. So indeed it might have\r\nbeen, had it been possible to civilize them as Romans, only profiting by\r\nthe introduction of new blood. But this process was no longer possible:\r\nits opposite, the barbarizing of Roman lands, steadily went on. Claudius\r\nonly reigned about two years. The great soldier who followed him in\r\n270-5, Aurelian, had a plan for employing prisoners of war[1368] on the\r\ncultivation of waste lands in Italy itself, but we have no reason to\r\nthink that much came of it. And the true state of things was confessed\r\nin his abandonment of Trajan’s great Province of Dacia. Aurelian\r\nwithdrew[1369] the army and the provincials, whom he settled south of the\r\nDanube in Moesia; putting the best face he could on this retirement by\r\ngiving Moesia the name of Dacia.\r\n\r\nThese phenomena attest an obvious truth, sometimes ignored, that\r\nterritorial expansion needs something more than military conquest to\r\ngive it lasting effect. In order to hold conquered lands the conquerors\r\nmust either occupy them or thoroughly assimilate the native population.\r\nEmperors in this period became aware that they could do neither.\r\nAlexander Severus (222-35) gained a great victory[1370] over the Persians\r\nand took a number of prisoners. It was a tradition of Persian kings not\r\nto let their subjects pass into foreign slavery, and Alexander allowed\r\nthem to redeem these captives by a money payment. This he used partly in\r\ncompensating the masters of those who had already passed into private\r\nownership, and the rest he paid into the treasury. This conciliatory\r\npolicy may have been wise. In any case the treasury was in this age\r\nchronically in need of ready money. But dealing with the great oriental\r\nmonarchy was a simpler undertaking than that of dealing with the rude\r\npeoples of the North, who pressed on in tribal units, offering no central\r\npower with which to negotiate. Probus (276-82) seems to have been sorely\r\ntroubled by their variety and independence of action. We hear that when\r\noperating in Thrace he settled 100,000 Bastarnae[1371] on Roman soil,\r\nand that all these kept faith with him. But he went on to transplant\r\nlarge bodies of Gepidae Gruthungi and Vandals. These all broke their\r\nfaith. While Probus was busy putting down pretenders in other parts of\r\nthe empire, they went on raiding expeditions at large by land and sea,\r\ndefying and damaging the power of Rome. True, the emperor broke them by\r\nforce of arms, and drove the remnant back to their wilds: but we can\r\nsee what the biographer ignores, that such raids did mischief which the\r\nempire was in no condition to repair. What were the terms made with\r\nthese barbarians, to which the Bastarnae faithfully adhered, we are not\r\ntold. Probably the grant of lands carried with it the duty of furnishing\r\nrecruits to Roman armies and accepting the command of Roman officers.\r\n\r\nIn connexion with agricultural conditions we must not omit to notice\r\nthe change that was passing over Roman armies. The straits to which\r\nMarcus had been reduced by the years of plague and losses in the field\r\nhad compelled him to raise fresh troops by any means, enrolling slaves,\r\nhiring barbarian mercenaries, and so forth. With this miscellaneous\r\nforce he just managed to hold his ground in the North. But the army\r\nnever recovered its old tone. The period 180-284 shews it going from\r\nbad to worse. It is full of sectional jealousy and losing all sense\r\nof common imperial duty; only effective when some one strong man\r\ndestroys his rivals and is for the moment supreme. The rise and fall\r\nof pretenders[1372] is a main topic of the imperial history. As from\r\nthe foundation of the Empire, the numbers of the army were inadequate\r\nfor defence against simultaneous attacks on several frontiers. The lack\r\nof cooperation among their enemies, and the mobility of Roman frontier\r\narmies, had sufficed to keep invaders at bay. But as pressure became\r\nmore continuous it was more difficult to meet the needs of the moment\r\nby moving armies to and fro. More and more they took on the character\r\nof garrisons, their chief camps grew into towns, local recruits filled\r\nup their ranks, and they were less and less available for service as\r\nfield-armies. But it was obviously necessary that the country round\r\nabout their quarters should be under cultivation, in order to supply\r\nthem with at least part of their food. It may safely be assumed that\r\nthis department was carefully attended to in the formation of all these\r\nmilitary stations. And it seems that under the new conditions one of the\r\nevils that had hitherto embarrassed the empire was gradually brought to\r\nan end. For the fact remains that, after all the wholesale waste of lives\r\nin the bloody wars of the third century, it was still possible to raise\r\ngreat and efficient armies. Reorganized by Diocletian and Constantine,\r\nthe empire proved able to defend itself for many years yet, even in the\r\nWest. The new system may have been oppressive to the civil population,\r\nbut it certainly revived military strength. This could not have been\r\nachieved without an improvement in the supply of man-power. It has\r\nbeen maintained[1373] that this improvement was due to the permanent\r\nsettlements of barbarians, mostly of German race, within the territories\r\nof the empire during the third century. Whether planted on the vacant\r\nlands as alien settlers (_inquilini_)[1374] on easy terms, but bound to\r\nprovide recruits for the army, or enlisted from the first and settled\r\nin permanent stations, they were year by year raising large families and\r\nturning deserted border-lands into nurseries of imperial soldiers. This\r\npicture may be somewhat overdrawn, but it has the merit of accounting\r\nfor the phenomena. Without some explanation of the kind it is very hard\r\nto understand how the empire came to survive at all. With it, the sequel\r\nappears natural and intelligible. These barbarians were so far Romanized\r\nas to be proud of becoming Romans: the empire was barbarized so far as to\r\nlend itself to institutions of a more and more un-Roman character, and\r\nto lose the remaining traditions of literature and art: and when ruder\r\nbarbarians in the fifth century assailed the empire in the West they\r\nfound the control of government already in the hands of kinsmen of their\r\nown.\r\n\r\nIf we are to take the very meagre gleanings from the general records\r\nof this period and combine them with the information gathered from the\r\nAfrican inscriptions referred to below, we can provisionally form some\r\nsort of notion of the various classes of labour employed on the land.\r\nFirst, there were _coloni_, freemen[1375] in the eye of the law, however\r\nmuch local conditions, or the terms of their tenancies and the tendency\r\nfor tenancies to become hereditary, may have limited the practical use\r\nof their legal freedom. Secondly, there were, at least in some parts,\r\nprotected occupants encouraged to turn to account parcels of land\r\nthat had for some reason or other lain idle. Thirdly, there were also\r\nrustic slaves who did most of the work on large farms. The stipulated\r\nservices of tenants[1376] at certain seasons to some extent supplemented\r\ntheir labour, at least in some parts: and the falling supply of slaves\r\ntended to make such auxiliary services more important. For the value\r\nof agricultural land depends mainly on the available supply of labour.\r\nFourthly, chiefly if not entirely in the northern Provinces, a number\r\nof barbarians had been planted upon Roman soil. Some entered peacefully\r\nand settled down as willing subjects of the empire on vacant lands\r\nassigned to them. Some had surrendered after defeat in battle, and came\r\nin as prisoners. But, instead of making them rustic slaves on the old\r\nmodel, Marcus had found a new and better use for them. A new status,\r\nthat of _inquilini_[1377] or ‘alien denizens’ was created, inferior to\r\nthat of free _coloni_ but above that of slaves. They seem to have been\r\ngenerally left to cultivate plots of land, paying a share of the produce,\r\nand to have been attached to the soil, grouped under Roman landlords\r\nor chief-tenants. They had their wives and families, and their sons\r\nrecruited Roman armies. Lastly, we have no right to assume that small\r\ncultivating owners[1378] were wholly extinct, though there can hardly\r\nhave been many of them.\r\n\r\nWe have an account[1379] of the rising in Africa (238 AD) which, so\r\nfar as it goes, gives us a little light on the agricultural situation\r\nthere in the middle of this period. The barbarian emperor Maximin was\r\nrepresented in the Province by a _procurator fisci_ whose oppressions\r\nprovoked a conspiracy against him. Some young men of good and wealthy\r\nfamilies drew together a number of persons who had suffered wrong. They\r\nordered their slaves[1380] from the farms to assemble with clubs and\r\naxes. In obedience[1381] to their masters’ orders they gathered in the\r\ntown before daybreak, and formed a great mob. For Africa is naturally a\r\npopulous[1382] country; so the tillers of the soil were numerous. After\r\ndawn the young leaders told the mass of the slaves to follow them as\r\nbeing a section of the general throng: they were to conceal their weapons\r\nfor the present, but valiantly to resist any attack on their masters. The\r\nlatter then met the procurator and assassinated him. Hereupon his guards\r\ndrew their swords meaning to avenge the murder, but the countrymen in\r\nsupport of their masters[1383] fell upon them with their rustic weapons\r\nand easily routed them. After this the young leaders, having gone too\r\nfar to draw back, openly rebelled against Maximin and proclaimed the\r\nproconsul Gordian Roman emperor. In this passage we have before us young\r\nmen of landlord families, apparently holding large estates and working\r\nthem with slave labour. They are evidently on good terms with their\r\nslaves. Of tenant farmers there is no mention: but there is a general\r\nreference to support given by other persons, already wronged or afraid\r\nof suffering wrong. The Latin biographer[1384], who drew from Herodian,\r\nspeaks of the murder as the work of ‘the rustic common folk[1385] and\r\ncertain soldiers.’ Now Frontinus[1386], writing in the latter part of\r\nthe first century AD, tells us that in Africa on their great estates\r\nindividuals had ‘a considerable population[1387] of common folk.’\r\nThe language can hardly refer to slaves: and a reference to levying\r\nrecruits[1388] for the army plainly forbids such an interpretation. But\r\nit does not imply that there were no slaves employed on those great\r\nestates; the writer is not thinking of the free-or-slave labour question.\r\nIn regard to the writers who record this particular episode, are we to\r\nsuppose that by ‘slaves’ Herodian loosely means _coloni_? Surely not.\r\nThen does Capitolinus by ‘rustic common folk’ mean slaves? I cannot\r\nbelieve it. More probably the writer, contemporary with Diocletian and\r\nConstantine, uses a loose expression without any precise meaning. If\r\nwe are to attempt any inference from the language of Herodian, we must\r\naccept him as a witness that in Africa, or at least in parts of Africa,\r\nagriculture was still being carried on by slave labour. This does not\r\nexclude the existence of a small-tenancy system side by side with it. And\r\nthe state of things disclosed[1389] in the African inscriptions referred\r\nto above is consistent with both systems: for that the manor-farm on\r\na great estate employed a slave staff for its regular operations, and\r\ndrew from tenants’ services only the help needed at certain seasons,\r\nseems the only possible conclusion from the evidence. Therefore, while\r\nagreeing with Heisterbergk[1390] that the narrative of Herodian shews the\r\npopulousness of Africa, we need not go so far as to ignore the fact of a\r\nconsiderable farm-slave element in the Province.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there are signs that rural Italy was suffering from the\r\ndisorders and insecurity that had so often hindered the prosperity of\r\nagriculture. Even under the strong reign of Severus, with a larger\r\nstanding army in Italy than ever before, a daring brigand[1391] remained\r\nat large for two years and was only captured by treachery. Though we do\r\nnot hear of his attacking farmers directly, such a disturbance must have\r\nbeen bad for all country folk. That he black-mailed them is probable:\r\nthat they were plundered and maltreated by the licentious soldiery\r\nemployed against him, is as nearly certain as can be from what we know of\r\nthe soldiery of this time.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVII. THE AFRICAN INSCRIPTIONS.\r\n\r\nCertain inscriptions[1392] from the Roman Province of Africa, dating\r\nfrom the second and third centuries AD or at least referring to matters\r\nof that period, throw some light upon the management of great imperial\r\ndomains in that part of the world. To discuss these in full one by\r\none would be beyond the scope of this work, and would require several\r\nchapters of intolerable length. I shall content myself with giving\r\na short account of each case, confined to those details which have\r\ndirect bearing on my subject and which can be gathered with reasonable\r\ncertainty from the often mutilated texts. French and German savants have\r\ncontributed freely to the deciphering and interpretation, with happy\r\nresults: but some of the proposed ‘restorations’ are much too bold to\r\nserve as a basis for further argument. After the details, I purpose to\r\nconsider the points common to these interesting cases, and their place\r\nin the history of agriculture and agricultural labour under the earlier\r\nRoman Empire, say from Trajan to Severus.\r\n\r\n(1) The inscription of Henschir Mettich[1393] belongs to the year 116-7\r\nAD, at the end of Trajan’s reign. It deals with a domain called _fundus\r\nvillae magnae Variani_, and does not refer to it by the term _saltus_ at\r\nall. There is no reference to arrears of rent, the _reliqua colonorum_\r\nof which we often hear in the jurists and other writers. Indeed there\r\nis no mention of money-rents, unless we reckon as such the little dues\r\n(4 _as_ per head) payable for grazing stock on the common pasture. The\r\n_coloni_ are _partiarii_, paying certain shares (generally ⅓) of their\r\nyearly produce as rent. These are paid, not to an imperial official but\r\nto the lords or head-tenants of the estate (_dominis aut conductoribus\r\neius fundi_) or to their stewards (_vilicis_). It seems certain therefore\r\nthat it was the chief tenants who were responsible to the imperial\r\ntreasury for the amounts annually due, and that upon them rested the\r\ntroublesome duty of collection. That this charge was a new one, laid\r\nupon them by Trajan, is perhaps possible, but hardly probable. For this\r\nstatute regulating the domain (a _lex data_) is expressly declared to\r\nbe modelled on a _lex Manciana_[1394], which can hardly be other than a\r\nset of regulations issued by a former owner of the estate, and adopted\r\nwith modifications by the imperial agents (_procuratores_) specially\r\nappointed to organize it as an imperial domain. In Roman practice it was\r\nusual to follow convenient precedents. How long the estate had become\r\nCrown-property, and by what process, inheritance purchase confiscation\r\netc, we do not know. Nor is it certain whether the new statute was\r\nprepared as a matter of course on the cessation of private ownership, or\r\nwhether it was issued in response to an appeal to the emperor complaining\r\nof oppressive exactions on the part of the head-tenants. But of the\r\nlatter situation there is no sign, and I am inclined to accept the\r\nformer alternative. In that case it appears necessary to suppose that\r\nthe system of letting a great estate to one or a few great lessees, who\r\nmight and did sublet parcels to small tenant farmers, was not unknown\r\nin the practice of great private landlords. This may well have been the\r\ncase in Africa, still populous and prosperous, though such a system never\r\ntook root in depopulated and failing Italy. It required willingness on\r\nthe part of men of substance to risk their capital in a speculation that\r\ncould only succeed if good sub-tenants were to be found. This condition\r\ncould not be fulfilled in Italy, but in Africa things were very different.\r\n\r\nIt is however easier to note this difference by unmistakeable signs\r\nthan to ascertain it in detail. One point is clear. The _coloni_ on\r\nthis domain were bound to render fixed services to the head-tenants\r\nat certain seasons of the year. These services consisted of two days’\r\nwork (_operas binas_) at the times of ploughing hoeing and harvest, six\r\nin all. The falling-off in the supply of slaves, despite occasional\r\ncaptures of prisoners in war, was a consequence of the _pax Romana_, and\r\nhow to provide sufficient labour was a standing problem of agriculture.\r\nThe guarantee of extra labour at seasons of pressure was doubtless a\r\nmain consideration with speculators in inducing them to venture their\r\nsubstance by becoming lessees of large tracts of land. Of hired labour\r\navailable for the purpose the statute gives no hint, nor is it likely\r\nthat such labourers were to be found in Africa. Thus the _colonus_, and\r\nperhaps his whole household, were bound to certain compulsory services,\r\nand thereby made part of an organization strictly regulated and liable to\r\nfurther regulation. Further regulation was not likely to give the peasant\r\nfarmer more freedom of movement, since the leading motive of the system\r\nwas to secure continuous cultivation, and this could best be secured by\r\nlong tenancies, tending to become hereditary. Therefore this statute\r\noffers various inducements to keep the peasant contentedly engaged in\r\nbettering his own position by developing the estate. The head-tenants are\r\nstrictly forbidden to oppress him by exacting larger shares of produce\r\nor more _operae_ than are allowed by the regulations. He is encouraged\r\nto cultivate parcels of waste land, not included in his farm, by various\r\nprivileges: in particular, a term of rent-free years is guaranteed to him\r\nin case he plants the land with fruit trees. This term, varying from five\r\nto ten years according to species of trees, is meant to give him time to\r\nget a taste of profit before he becomes liable to rent: its effect in\r\nmaking him loth to move is obvious.\r\n\r\nThe statute tells us nothing on another important point. From the\r\njurists and other sources[1395] we know that in Italy it was normally\r\nthe custom for the stock of a farm let to a _colonus_ to be found for\r\nthe most part by the landlord. It was held[1396] that in taking over\r\nthis _instrumentum_ at a valuation the tenant virtually purchased it, of\r\ncourse not paying for it in ready money, but standing bound to account\r\nfor the amount on quitting the tenancy. Thus a small man was left free\r\nto employ his own little capital in the actual working of the farm. He\r\ncould add to the stock, and his additions gave to the landlord a further\r\nsecurity for his rent, over and above that given by the sureties usually\r\nrequired. What stock was found by landlords, and what by tenant, was\r\na matter for agreement generally following local convention. But on\r\nthis African domain we are not told how the question of _instrumentum_\r\nwas settled. Probably there was a traditional rule so well established\r\nthat no reference to the point in the statute seemed necessary. The\r\nsole landlord was now the emperor. Without some direct evidence to\r\nthat effect, I can hardly suppose that the provision of farm stock\r\nwas entrusted to his _procuratores_. On the other hand, if the chief\r\ntenants, the _conductores_, were expected to undertake this business, as\r\nif they had been landlords, this too seems to call for direct evidence.\r\nPossibly the need of finding stock for an African peasant farmer was\r\nnot so pressing as in Italy: still some equipment was surely required.\r\nHow it was provided, seems to me a question for answering which we have\r\nnot as yet sufficient materials. But it may be that on these domains\r\nthe practical necessity for dealing with it seldom occurred. If, when\r\nthe formal term of a tenancy expired, the same tenant stayed on either\r\nby tacit renewal (_reconductio_) or by grant of a new lease, the stock\r\noriginally supplied would surely remain for use on the farm, upkeep\r\nand renewals of particular articles being of course allowed for. If a\r\nfarmer’s son succeeded him as tenant, the situation would be the same, or\r\nvery nearly so. Therefore the manifest desire of emperors to keep tenants\r\nin permanence probably operated to minimize questions of _instrumentum_\r\nto the point of practical insignificance.\r\n\r\nThat the _coloni_ on this estate were themselves handworkers can\r\nhardly be doubted. The _operae_ required of them suggest this on any\r\nnatural interpretation. But there is nothing to shew that they did not\r\nemploy[1397] slave labour—if and when they could get it. We are not\r\nto assume that they were all on one dead level of poverty. That the\r\nhead-tenants kept slaves to work those parts of the domain that they\r\nfarmed for their own account, is indicated by the mention of their\r\n_vilici_, and made certain by the small amount of supplementary labour\r\nguaranteed them in the form of tenants’ _operae_. Only one direct mention\r\nof slaves (_servis dominicis_) occurs in the inscription, and the text\r\nis in that place badly mutilated. Partly for the same defect, it seems\r\nnecessary to avoid discussing certain other details, such as the position\r\nof the _stipendiarii_ of whom we hear in a broken passage. Nor do I\r\nventure to draw confident inferences from the references to _inquilini_\r\nor _coloni inquilini_, or to discover an important distinction between\r\nthe tenants who actually resided on the estate and those who did not.\r\nIt may be right to infer a class of small proprietors dwelling around\r\non the skirts of the great domain and hiring parcels of land within it.\r\nIt may be right to regard the _inquilini_ as _coloni_ transplanted from\r\nabroad and made residents on the estate. But until such conclusions are\r\nmore surely established it is safer to refrain from building upon them.\r\nThe general effect of this document is to give us outlines of a system\r\nof imperial ‘peculiars,’ that is of domains on which order and security,\r\nnecessary for the successful working and continuous cultivation, were not\r\nleft to the operation of the ordinary law, but guaranteed in each case by\r\nwhat we may call an imperial by-law.\r\n\r\n(2) The inscription of Souk el Khmis[1398] deals with circumstances\r\nbetween 180 and 183 AD. The rescript of Commodus, and the appeal to which\r\nit was the answer, are recorded in it. The imperial estate to which it\r\nrefers is called _saltus Burunitanus_. A single _conductor_ appears to\r\nhave been the lessee of the whole estate, and it was against his unlawful\r\nexactions that the _coloni_ appealed. Through the connivance of the\r\nresponsible _procurator_ (corruptly obtained, the _coloni_ hint,) this\r\ntyrant had compelled them to pay larger shares of produce than were\r\nrightly due, and also to render services of men and beasts beyond the\r\namount fixed by statute. This abuse had existed on the estate for some\r\ntime, but the proceedings of the present _conductor_ had made it past all\r\nbearing. Evidently there had been some resistance, but official favour\r\nhad enabled him to employ military force in suppressing it. Violence\r\nhad been freely used: some persons had been arrested and imprisoned or\r\notherwise maltreated; others had been severely beaten, among them even\r\nRoman citizens. Hence the appeal. It is to be noted that the appellants\r\nin no way dispute their liability to pay shares of produce (_partes\r\nagrarias_) or to render labour-services at the usual seasons of pressure\r\n(_operarum praebitionem iugorumve_). They refer to a clause in a _lex\r\nHadriana_, regulating these dues. It is against the exaction of more\r\nthan this statute allows that they venture to protest. They judiciously\r\npoint out to the emperor that such doings are injurious to the financial\r\ninterest[1399] of his treasury (_in perniciem rationum tuarum_), that\r\nis, they will end by ruining the estate as a source of steady revenue.\r\nThe officials of the central department in Rome were evidently of the\r\nsame opinion, for the rescript of Commodus[1400] plainly ordered his\r\n_procuratores_ to follow closely the rules and policy applicable to\r\nthe domains, permitting no exactions in transgression of the standing\r\nregulations (_contra perpetuam formam_). In short, he reaffirmed the\r\nstatute of Hadrian.\r\n\r\nIn this document also we hear nothing of tenants’ arrears or of\r\nmoney-rents. Naturally enough, for the _coloni_ are _partiarii_\r\nwhose rent is a share of produce. In connexion with such tenants the\r\ndifficulty[1401] of _reliqua_ does not easily arise. They are labouring\r\npeasants, who describe themselves as _homines rustici tenues manuum\r\nnostrarum operis victum tolerantes_. Of course they are posing as\r\ninjured innocents. Perhaps they were: at any rate the great officials\r\nin Rome would look kindly on humble peasants who only asked protection\r\nin order to go on unmolested, producing the food which it was their\r\nduty to produce,—food, by the by, of the need of which the Roman mob\r\nwas a standing reminder. Of _vilici_ or ordinary slaves this document\r\nsays nothing, for it had no need to do so; but the right to _operae_\r\nat certain seasons implies slave labour on the head-tenant’s own farm,\r\nprobably attached to the chief _villa_ or _palatium_. In a notable\r\nphrase at the end of their appeal the _coloni_ speak of themselves[1402]\r\nas ‘your peasants, home-bred slaves and foster-children of your\r\ndomains’ (_rustici tui vernulae et alumni saltuum tuorum_). Surely this\r\nimplies, not only that they are _coloni Caesaris_, standing in a direct\r\nrelation to the emperor whose protection[1403] they implore against the\r\n_conductores agrorum fiscalium_; but also that their connexion with\r\nthe estate is an old-established one, passing from fathers to sons, a\r\nhereditary tie which they have at present no wish to see broken.\r\n\r\nIn this case the circumstances that led to the setting-up of the\r\ninscription are clear enough. Evidently the appeal represented a great\r\neffort, both in the way of organizing concerted action on the part of the\r\npeasant farmers, and in overcoming the hindrances to its presentation\r\nwhich would be created by the interested ingenuity of those whose acts\r\nwere thereby called in question. The imperial officials in the Provinces\r\nwere often secretly in league with those in authority at Rome, and to\r\nhave procured an imperial rescript in favour of the appellants was a\r\ngreat triumph, perhaps a rare one. The _forma perpetua_ containing the\r\nregulations governing the estate was, we learn, already posted up on\r\na bronze tablet. It had been disregarded: and now it was an obvious\r\nprecaution to record that the emperor had ordered those regulations to be\r\nobserved in future. How long the effect of this rescript lasted we are\r\nleft to guess. Officials changed, and reaffirmation of principles could\r\nnot guarantee permanent reform of practice. Still, the policy of the\r\ncentral bureau, when not warped by corrupt influence, was consistent and\r\nclear. To keep these imperial ‘peculiars’ on such a footing as to insure\r\nsteady returns was an undoubted need: and, after the extreme strain on\r\nthe resources of the empire imposed by the calamitous times of Marcus, it\r\nwas in the reign of Commodus a greater need than ever.\r\n\r\n(3) The Gazr Mezuâr inscription[1404], very fragmentary and in some\r\npoints variously interpreted, belongs to the same period (181 AD). A\r\nfew details seem sufficiently certain to be of use here. The estate in\r\nquestion is imperial property, apparently one of the domanial units\r\nrevealed to us by these African documents. It seems to record another\r\ncase of appeal against unlawful exaction of _operae_, probably by a\r\n_conductor_ or _conductores_. It also was successful. But it is notable\r\nthat the lawful amount of _operae_ to be rendered by _coloni_ on this\r\nestate was just double of that fixed in the other cases—four at each\r\nof the seasons of pressure, twelve in all. We can only infer that the\r\ntask-scale varied on various estates for reasons unknown to us. One\r\nfragment, if a probable restoration[1405] is to be accepted, conveys\r\nthe impression of a despairing threat on the part of the appellants. It\r\nsuggests that on failure of redress they may be driven to return to their\r\nhomes where they can make their abode in freedom. On the face of it, this\r\nis an assertion of freedom of movement, a valuable piece of evidence, if\r\nit can be trusted. We may safely go so far as to note that it is at least\r\nnot inconsistent with other indications pointing to the same conclusion.\r\nWe may even remark that the suggestion of going home in search of freedom\r\nagrees better with the notion that these _coloni_ were African natives\r\nthan with the supposition of their Italian origin. The Roman citizens\r\non the Burunitan estate will not support the latter view, for they are\r\nmentioned as exceptional. Seeck (rightly, I think,) urges that Italy was\r\nin sore need of men and had none to spare for populous Africa. I would\r\nadd that the emigration of Italians to the Provinces as working farmers\r\nseems to require more proof than has yet been produced. As officials,\r\nas traders, as financiers and petty usurers, as exploiters of other\r\nmen’s labour, they abounded in the subject countries; but, so far as I\r\ncan learn, not as labourers. Many of them no doubt held landed estates,\r\nfor instance in the southern parts of Spain and Gaul. But when we meet\r\nwith loose general expressions[1406] such as ‘The Roman is dwelling in\r\nevery land that he has conquered,’ we must not let them tempt us into\r\noverestimating the number of Italian settlers taking an active part in\r\nthe operations of provincial agriculture.\r\n\r\n(4) The inscription of Ain Ouassel[1407] belongs to the end of the\r\nreign of Severus. The text is much broken, but information of no small\r\nimportance can be gathered from what remains. Severus was himself a\r\nnative of Africa, and may have taken a personal interest in the subject\r\nof this ordinance. In point of form the document chiefly consists of a\r\nquoted communication (_sermo_) from the emperor’s _procuratores_[1408],\r\none of whom, a freedman, saw to its publication in an inscription on an\r\n_ara legis divi Hadriani_. A copy of the _lex Hadriana_, or at least\r\nthe relevant clauses thereof, was included. The matter on which the\r\nemperor’s decision is announced was the question of the right to occupy\r\nand cultivate rough lands (_rudes agri_)[1409], which are defined as\r\nlands either simply waste or such as the _conductores_ have neglected\r\nto cultivate for at least ten years preceding. These lands are included\r\nin no less than five different _saltus_ mentioned by proper names, and\r\nthe scope of the ordinance is wider than in the cases referred to above.\r\nIt appears that, while it may have contained some modifications or\r\nextensions of the provisions of the _lex Hadriana_, its main bearing was\r\nto reaffirm and apply the privileges granted by that statute. It is not\r\nrash to infer that we have here evidence of a set of regulations for all\r\nor many of the African domains, forming a part of Hadrian’s great work of\r\nreorganization.\r\n\r\nIf the remaining words of this inscription are rightly interpreted,\r\nas I think they are, it seems that the policy of encouraging the\r\ncultivation of waste and derelict lands was at this time being revived\r\nby the government. We have seen it at work in Trajan’s time, promoted by\r\nguarantee of privileges and temporary exemption from burdens. But the\r\npersons then encouraged to undertake the work of reclamation were to all\r\nappearance only the _coloni_ at the time resident on the estate. In the\r\ncase of these five _saltus_, the offer seems to be made more widely,\r\nat least so far as the remaining text may justify such conclusions. It\r\nreads like an attempt to attract enterprising squatters of any kind from\r\nany quarter. They are offered not merely undisturbed occupation and a\r\nheritable tenure of some sort, but actual _possessio_. Now this right,\r\nwhich fills a whole important chapter in Roman law, was one protected by\r\nspecial legal remedies, and even on an imperial domain can hardly have\r\nbeen a matter of indifference. It was quite distinct from mere _possessio\r\nnaturalis_[1410], which was all that the ordinary _colonus_ enjoyed on\r\nhis own behalf. This new-type squatter is allowed the same privilege of\r\nso many years of grace, free of rent, at the outset of his enterprise,\r\nthat we have noted above. The details are somewhat different. For olives\r\nthe free term is ten years: for fruit trees (_poma_, here mentioned\r\nwithout reference to vines) it is seven years. It is expressly provided\r\nthat the _divisio_, which implies the partiary system of tenancy, shall\r\napply only to such _poma_ as are actually brought[1411] to market. This\r\nsuggests that in the past attempts to levy the quota as a proportional\r\nshare of the gross crop, without regard to the needs of the grower’s\r\nown household, had been found to discourage reclamation. It has been\r\npointed out that the effect of the new policy would be to create a\r\nsort of perpetual leasehold, similar to that known by the Greek term\r\n_emphyteusis_, which is found fully established in the later empire.\r\nBut the land was not all under fruit-crops. The disposal of corn crops\r\nis regulated in a singular clause thus. ‘Any shares of dry[1412] crops\r\nthat shall be due are, during the first five years of occupation, to be\r\ndelivered to the head-tenant within whose holding[1413] the land occupied\r\nis situate. After the lapse of that time they are to go to the account\r\n(of the Treasury[1414]).’ Why is the _conductor_ to receive these _partes\r\naridae_? It is reasonably suggested that the intention was to obviate\r\ninitial obstruction on the part of the big lessee, and thus to give the\r\nreclamation-project a fair start.\r\n\r\nFor we have no right to assume that the parcels of land thrown open to\r\noccupation had hitherto been included[1415] in no tenancy. The whole\r\nimport of the document shews that they often belonged to this or that\r\narea held by one or other of the big lessees. That there was at least one\r\n_conductor_ to each of the five _saltus_ seems certain. That there was\r\nonly one to each, is perhaps probable, but hardly to be gathered from\r\nthe text. Now, so long as the _conductor_ regularly paid his fixed rent\r\n(_canon_) and accounted for the taxes (_tributa_) due from the estate,\r\nwhy should the imperial authority step in to take pieces of land (and\r\nthat the poorest land) out of his direct control? The answer to this is\r\nthat the Roman law[1416] recognized the right of a private landlord to\r\nrequire of his tenants that they should not ‘let down’ the land leased to\r\nthem: and proof of neglected cultivation might operate to bar a tenant’s\r\nclaim for abatement of rent. What was the right of an ordinary landlord\r\nwas not likely to be waived by an emperor: though his domains might be\r\nadministered in fact by a special set of fiscal regulations, he claimed\r\na right analogous to that recognized by the ordinary law, and none could\r\nchallenge its exercise. A big lessee might often find that parts of his\r\nholding could not be cultivated at a profit under existing conditions.\r\nSlave labour was careless and inefficient; it was in these times also\r\ncostly, so costly that it only paid to employ it on generous soils.\r\nThe task-work of _coloni_ did not amount to much, and it was no doubt\r\nrendered grudgingly. He was tempted to economize in slaves[1417] and to\r\nemploy his reduced staff on the best land only. We need not suppose that\r\nhe got an abatement of his fixed rent from the fiscal authorities: he\r\nwas most unlikely to attract their attention by making such a claim. He\r\nhad made his bargain with eyes presumably open. That he had agreed to\r\nthe _canon_ assures us that it must have been low enough to leave him a\r\ncomfortable margin for profit. We may be fairly sure that he sat quiet\r\nand did what seemed to pay him best.\r\n\r\nIn the remaining text of this statute there is no reference to _operae_\r\ndue from the new squatters, and nothing is said of _coloni_. This\r\ndoes not seem to be due to injury of the stone. The persons for whose\r\nbenefit the statute is enacted are apparently a new or newly recognized\r\nelement[1418] in the population of these domains, not _coloni_. But\r\nthe rights offered to them are expressly referred to as rights granted\r\nby the statute of Hadrian. If so, then the _lex Hadriana_ contemplated\r\nthe establishment of a new peasant class, not _coloni_, and the present\r\nstatute was merely a revival of Hadrian’s scheme. The men are eventually\r\nto pay shares of crops, and Schulten’s[1419] view, that they are on the\r\nway to become _coloni_, is possible, if not probable. When he remarks\r\nthat they might find the position of _coloni_ a doubtful boon, we need\r\nnot challenge his opinion.\r\n\r\n(5) The inscription of Ain el Djemala[1420], a later discovery (1906)\r\nis of special importance as belonging to the same neighbourhood as the\r\npreceding one. It is a document of Hadrian’s time. It refers to the same\r\ngroup of estates as the above, and deals with the same matter, the right\r\nto cultivate waste or derelict parcels of land. Indeed the connexion of\r\nthe two inscriptions is so close that the parts preserved of each can\r\nbe safely used to fill gaps in the text of the other. In a few points\r\nthis inscription, the earlier in date, supplies further detail. The\r\nmost notable is that another estate, a _saltus_ or _fundus Neronianus_,\r\nis mentioned in it, and not in the later one. Thus it would seem that\r\nit referred to six estates, a curious coincidence, when we recall the\r\nsix great African landlords made away with by Nero. Another little\r\naddition is that waste lands are defined as marshy or wooded. Also that\r\nthe land is spoken of as fit for growing olives vines and corn-crops,\r\nwhich supplements a mutilated portion of the Ain Ouassel stone. But in\r\none point the difference between the two is on the face of it difficult\r\nto reconcile. In addressing the imperial _procuratores_ the applicants\r\nbase their request on the _lex Manciana_, the benefit of which they\r\nseek to enjoy[1421] as used on the neighbouring _saltus Neronianus_.\r\nHere the broken text is thought to have contained a reference to the\r\nenhanced prosperity of that estate owing to the concession. In any case\r\nwe may fairly conclude that the _lex Manciana_ was well known in the\r\ndistrict, and its regulations regarded by the farmers as favourable to\r\ntheir interests. But the reply to their petition does not refer to it as\r\nthe immediate basis of the decision given. The communication (_sermo_)\r\nof Hadrian’s procurators is cited as the ground of the leave granted\r\nfor cultivation of waste lands. Yet the broken sentence at the end\r\nof the inscription seems at least to shew that the rules of the _lex\r\nManciana_ were still recognized as a standard, confirmed and perhaps\r\nincorporated, or referred to by name, in the _lex Hadriana_ itself.\r\nIt is ingeniously suggested that the farmers rest their case on the\r\n_Manciana_ because the _Hadriana_ was as yet unknown to them; while the\r\nreply refers to Hadrian’s statute as authority. Whether the _saltus_ or\r\n_fundus Neronianus_, on which the Mancian regulations were in force, is\r\nanother estate-unit similar to the five named both here and in the later\r\ninscription, is a point on which I have some doubts, too little connected\r\nwith my subject for discussion here. The general scope of the concession\r\ngranted by Hadrian is the same as the later one of Severus.\r\n\r\nIf Hadrian issued a statute or statutes regulating the terms of occupancy\r\non the African domains, and some attempts to evade it were met by its\r\nreaffirmation under Commodus, it is quite natural that neglect or\r\nevasion of it in some other respects should be met by reaffirmation\r\nunder Severus. This consideration will account for the identity of the\r\nconcessions granted in these two inscriptions. And it agrees perfectly\r\nwith the evidence of later legislation in the Theodosian code. The\r\nnormal course of events is, legislation to protect the poorer classes\r\nof cultivators, then evasion of the law by the selfish rich, then\r\nreenactment of evaded laws, generally with increased penalties. That\r\nunder the administrative system of the domains much the same phenomena\r\nshould occur, is only what we might expect.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVIII. DISCUSSION OF THE ABOVE INSCRIPTIONS.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the state of things revealed to us by these inscriptions\r\nwe must carefully bear in mind that they relate solely to the Province\r\nAfrica. Conditions there were in many ways exceptional. When Rome took\r\nover this territory after the destruction of Carthage in 146 BC, it was\r\nprobably a country divided for the most part into great estates worked\r\non the Carthaginian system by slave labour. Gradually the land came more\r\nand more into the hands of Roman capitalists, to whose opulence Horace\r\nrefers. Pliny tells us that in Nero’s time six[1422] great landlords\r\npossessed half the entire area of the Province, when that emperor found\r\na pretext for putting them to death and confiscating their estates.\r\nHenceforth the ruling emperor was the predominating landlord[1423] in\r\na Province of immense importance, in particular as a chief granary of\r\nRome. We are not to suppose that any change in the system of large units\r\nwas ever contemplated. Punic traditions, probably based on experience,\r\nfavoured the system; though the Punic language, still spoken, seems to\r\nhave been chiefly confined to the seaboard districts. What the change\r\nof lordship effected was not only to the financial advantage of the\r\nimperial treasury: it also put an end to the creation of what were a sort\r\nof little principalities that might some day cause serious trouble. At\r\nthis point we are tempted to wonder whether the great landlords, before\r\nthe sweeping measure of Nero, had taken any steps towards introducing a\r\nnew organization in the management of their estates. Trajan’s statute\r\nrefers to a _lex Manciana_ and adopts a number of its regulations. These\r\nregulations clearly contemplate a system of head-tenants and sub-tenants,\r\nof whom the latter seem to be actual working farmers living of the labour\r\nof their own hands, as those who some 65 years later described themselves\r\nin appealing to Commodus. The former have stewards in charge of the\r\ncultivation of the ‘manor farms’ attached to the principal farmsteads,\r\nand evidently employ gangs of slaves: but at special seasons have a\r\nright to a limited amount[1424] of task-labour from the free sub-tenants\r\nof the small farms. That these labour-conditions were devised to meet a\r\ndifficulty in procuring enough slaves to carry on the cultivation of the\r\nwhole big estate, is an inference hardly to be resisted. That we find it\r\non more than one estate indicates that for the time it was serving its\r\npurpose. But, in admitting that it probably began under the rule of great\r\nprivate landlords, we must not lose sight of the fact that it was liable\r\nto grievous abuse, and that even the regulations of Hadrian did not\r\nremove the necessity of pitiful appeals for redress.\r\n\r\nAn important characteristic of these estates was that they were outside\r\nthe municipal[1425] system. Each of the so-called _civitates_ had\r\nits own charter or statute (_lex_) conforming more or less closely\r\nto a common[1426] model, under which the municipal authorities could\r\nregulate the management of lands within its territory. But these great\r\nestates were independent[1427] of such local jurisdictions. And this\r\nindependence would seem to date from the times of private ownership,\r\nbefore the conversion of many of them into imperial domains. Mommsen\r\nthought that this separate treatment of them as ‘peculiars’ began in\r\nItaly under the Republic, and was due to the influence of the landowning\r\naristocracy, who were bent upon admitting no such concurrent authority\r\non their _latifundia_. This may have been so, and the extension of\r\nlarge-scale possessions to the Provinces may have carried the system\r\nabroad. At all events there it was, and it suited the convenience of\r\na grasping emperor: he had only to get rid of the present possessor\r\nand carry on the administration of the domain as before: his agents\r\nstepped into the place of those employed by the late landlord, and only\r\nslight modification of the current regulations would be required. He\r\nissued a statute for management of ‘crown-property’ as he would for\r\na municipality. It was in effect a local law, and it does not appear\r\nthat the common law administered by the ordinary courts could override\r\nit. The imperial _procurator_ was practically the magistrate charged\r\nwith its administration in addition to his financial duties, for\r\ngovernment and extraction of revenue were really two sides of the same\r\nfunction. Obviously the interests of the emperor, of his agent, of the\r\nhead-tenants, and of the peasant cultivators, were not the same. But the\r\npeasant, who wanted to pay as little as possible, and the emperor who\r\nwanted to receive steady returns—as large as possible, but above all\r\nthings steady—had a common interest in preventing unlawful exactions, by\r\nwhich a stable income was imperilled and the prosperity of the cultivator\r\nimpaired. On the other hand the _procurator_ and the _conductor_ could\r\nonly make illicit profits through combining to rob the emperor by\r\nsqueezing his _coloni_. How to accomplish this was no doubt a matter\r\nof delicate calculation. How much oppression would the _coloni_ stand\r\nwithout resorting to the troublesome and risky process of an appeal? We\r\nonly hear of one or two appeals made with success. Of those that were\r\nmade and rejected or foiled by various arts, and of those abandoned in\r\ndespair at an early stage, we get no record. Yet that such cases did\r\noccur, perhaps not seldom, we may be reasonably sure.\r\n\r\nIt is well to remember that Columella, in whose treatise letting of\r\nfarms to tenants first appears, not as an occasional expedient but as\r\npart of a reasoned scheme of estate-management, makes provision for a\r\n_procurator_[1428] as well as a _vilicus_. One duty of the former is\r\nto keep an eye on the latter. In the management of great estates an\r\natmosphere of mistrust is perhaps to some extent unavoidable. In an\r\nagricultural system based on slave labour, this mistrust begins at the\r\nvery bottom of the structure and reaches to the very top, as is shewn\r\nby all experience ancient and modern. Industry in slaves, diligence\r\nand honesty in agents and stewards, are not to be relied on when these\r\nsubordinates have no share in the profit derived from the practice\r\nof such virtues. And mistrust of slaves and freedmen did not imply a\r\nsimple trust in free tenants. Columella only advises[1429] letting\r\nto tenants in circumstances that make it impracticable to cultivate\r\nprofitably by a slave-staff under a steward. The plan is a sort of last\r\nresort, and it can only work well if the tenants stay on continuously.\r\nTherefore care should be taken to make the position of the _coloni_\r\npermanently attractive. This advice is primarily designed for Italy,\r\nbut its principles are of general application, and no doubt justified\r\nby experience. Their extension to _latifundia_ abroad, coupled with\r\na falling-off in the supply of slaves, led to similar results: great\r\nestates might still be in part worked by slave labour under stewards, but\r\nletting parcels to small tenants became a more and more vital feature of\r\nthe system. But to deal directly from a distance with a number of such\r\npeasant farmers would be a troublesome business. We need not wonder that\r\nit became customary to let large blocks of land, even whole _latifundia_,\r\nto big lessees, speculative men who undertook the subletting and\r\nrent-collecting of part of their holdings, while they could work\r\nthe central manor-farm by slave labour on their own account, and\r\ngenerally exploit the situation for their own profit. Thus, as once the\r\n_latifundium_ had absorbed little properties, so now its subdivision was\r\ngenerating little tenancies, with chief-tenants as a sort of middlemen\r\nbetween the _dominus_ and the _coloni_. To protect the _colonus_, the\r\npowers of the _conductor_[1430] had to be strictly limited: to ease the\r\nlabour-problem and retain the _conductor_, a certain amount of task-work\r\nhad to be required of the _colonus_. And this last condition was ominous\r\nof the coming serfdom.\r\n\r\nIf the economic situation and the convenience of non-resident landlords\r\noperated to produce a widespread system of letting to small tenants, it\r\nwas naturally an object to levy the rents in such a form as would best\r\nsecure a safe and regular return. To exact a fixed money-rent would mean\r\nthat the peasant must spend time in marketing his produce in order to\r\nprocure the necessary cash, and thereby lessen the time spent in actual\r\nfarm-labour. In bad years he would look for an abatement of his rent,\r\nnor would it be easy to satisfy him: here was material for disputes and\r\ndiscontent. Such difficulties were known in Italy and elsewhere, and\r\njurists recognized[1431] an advantage of the ‘partiary’ system in this\r\nconnexion. An abatement of rent due in a particular year need not imply\r\nthat the landlord lost the amount of abatement for good and all. If the\r\nnext year produced a ‘bumper’ crop, the landlord was entitled to claim\r\nrestitution of last year’s abatement in addition to the yearly rent. This\r\ntoo, it seems, in the case of a tenant sitting at a fixed money-rent. But\r\nthe _partiarius colonus_ is on another footing: he shares gain and loss\r\nwith the _dominus_, with whom he is a quasi-partner[1432]. It was surely\r\nconsiderations of this kind that led to the adoption of the share-rent\r\nsystem on these great African estates. By fixing the proportion on a\r\nmoderate scale, the peasant was fairly certain to be able to pay his\r\nrent, and he would not be harassed with money transactions dependent on\r\nthe fluctuations in the price of corn. Under such conditions he was more\r\nlikely to be contented and to stay on where he was, and that this should\r\nbe so was precisely what the landlord desired. On the other hand the big\r\n_conductor_ might pay rent either in coin or kind. He was a speculator,\r\ndoubtless well able to take care of his own interests: probably the\r\nnormal case was that he agreed to a fixed cash payment, and only took the\r\nlease on terms that left him a good prospect of making it a remunerative\r\nventure. But on this point there is need of further evidence.\r\n\r\nWhen the emperor took over an estate of this kind, such an existing\r\norganization would be admirably fitted to continue under the fiscal\r\nadministration. Apparently this is just what happened. One small but\r\nimportant improvement would be automatically produced by the change. The\r\n_coloni_ would now become _coloni Caesaris_[1433] and whatever protection\r\nagainst exactions of _conductores_ they may have enjoyed under the sway\r\nof their former lords was henceforth not less likely to be granted and\r\nmuch more certain of effect. To the fiscal officials any course of action\r\ntending to encourage permanent tenancies and steady returns would on\r\nthe face of it be welcome: for it was likely to save them trouble, if\r\nnot to bring them credit. The only influence liable to incline them in\r\nanother direction was corruption in some form or other, leading them\r\nto connive at misdeeds of the local agents secretly in league with the\r\nhead-lessees on the spot. That cases of such connivance occurred in the\r\nperiod from Trajan to Severus is not to be doubted. During the following\r\nperiod of confusion they probably became frequent. But it was not until\r\nDiocletian introduced a more elaborate imperial system, and increased\r\nimperial burdens to defray its greater cost, that the evil reached its\r\nheight. Then the corruption of officials tainted all departments, and\r\nwas the canker ever gnawing at the vital forces of the empire. But that\r\nthis deadly corruption was a sudden growth out of an existing purity is\r\nnot to be imagined. All this is merely an illustration of that oldest\r\nof political truisms, that to keep practice conformable to principle is\r\nsupremely difficult. The only power that seems to be of any effect in\r\nchecking the decay of departmental virtue is the power of public opinion.\r\nNow a real public opinion cannot be said to have existed in the Roman\r\nEmpire; and, had it existed, there was no organ through which it could\r\nbe expressed. And the Head of the State, let him be ever so devoted to\r\nthe common weal, was too overburdened with manifold responsibilities to\r\nbe able to give personal attention to each complaint and prescribe an\r\nequitable remedy.\r\n\r\nHow far we are entitled to trace a movement of policy by the contents of\r\nthese African inscriptions is doubtful. They are too few, and too much\r\nalike. Perhaps we may venture to detect a real step onward in the latest\r\nof them. The renewal of the encouragement of squatter-settlers[1434] on\r\nderelict lands does surely point to a growing consciousness that the\r\nfood-question was becoming a more and more serious one. Perhaps it may be\r\ntaken to suggest that the system of leasing the African domains to big\r\n_conductores_ had lately been found failing in efficiency. But it is\r\nrash to infer much from a single case: and the African Severus may have\r\nfollowed an exceptional policy in his native province. It is when we look\r\nback from the times of the later Empire, with its frantic legislation to\r\nbind _coloni_ to the soil, and to enforce the cultivation of every patch\r\nof arable ground, that we are tempted to detect in every record symptoms\r\nof the coming constraint. As yet the central government had not laid\r\nits cramping and sterilizing hand on every part of its vast dominions.\r\nMoreover the demands on African productivity had not yet reached their\r\nextreme limit. There was as yet no Constantinople, and Egypt still shared\r\nwith Africa the function of supplying food to Rome. Thus it is probably\r\nreasonable to believe that the condition of the working tenant-farmers\r\nwas in this age a tolerable[1435] one. If those on the great domains\r\nwere bit by bit bound to their holdings, it was probably with their own\r\nconsent, so far at least that, seeing no better alternative, they became\r\nstationary and more or less dependent peasants. In other parts of Africa,\r\nfor instance near Carthage, we hear of wealthy landowners employing\r\nbodies of slaves. Some of these men may well have been Italians: at least\r\nthey took a leading part later in the rising against Maximin and the\r\nelevation of Gordian.\r\n\r\nIn connexion with the evidence of this group of inscriptions it may\r\nbe not out of place to say a few words on the view set forth by\r\nHeisterbergk, that the origin of the later serf-colonate was Provincial,\r\nnot Italian. He argues[1436] that what ruined small-scale farming in\r\nItaly was above all things the exemption of Italian land from taxation.\r\nLandlords were not constrained by the yearly exaction of dues to make\r\nthe best economic use of their estates. Vain land-pride and carelessness\r\nwere not checked: mismanagement and waste had free course, and small\r\ncultivation declined. The fall in free rustic population was both effect\r\nand cause. In the younger Pliny’s time good tenants were already hard\r\nto find, but great landlords owned parks and mansions everywhere. In\r\nthe Provinces nearly all the land was subject to imperial taxation in\r\nkind or in money, and owners could not afford to let it lie idle. The\r\npractical control of vast estates was not possible from a distance. The\r\ndirection of agriculture, especially of extensive farming (corn etc) from\r\na fixed centre was little less difficult. There was therefore strong\r\ninducement to delegate the business of cultivation to tenants, and to\r\nlet the difference in amount between their rents and the yearly imperial\r\ndues represent the landlord’s profit. Thus the spread of _latifundia_\r\nswallowed up small holdings in the Provinces as in Italy; but it\r\nconverted small owners into small tenants, and did not merge the holdings\r\ninto large slave-gang plantations or throw them into pasture. The plan of\r\nleasing a large estate as a whole to a big head-tenant, or establishing\r\nhim in the central ‘manor farm,’ was quite consistent with the general\r\ndesign, and this theory accounts for the presence of a population of free\r\n_coloni_, whom later legislation might and did bind fast to the soil.\r\n\r\nThis argument has both ingenuity and force, but we can only assent to it\r\nwith considerable reservations. Letting to free _coloni_ was a practice\r\nlong used in Italy, and in the first century AD was evidently becoming\r\nmore common. It was but natural that it should appear in the Provinces.\r\nStill, taken by itself, there is no obvious reason why it should develope\r\ninto serfdom. With the admitted scarcity and rising value of labour, why\r\nwas it that the freeman did not improve his position in relation to his\r\nlord, indeed to capitalists in general? I think the presence of the big\r\nlessee, the _conductor_, an employer of slave labour, had not a little\r\nto do with it. Labour as such was despised. The requirement of task-work\r\nto supplement that of slaves on the ‘manor farm’ was not likely to make\r\nlabour more esteemed. Yet to get his little holding the _colonus_ had to\r\nput up with this condition. It may be significant that we hear nothing\r\nof _coloni_ working for wages in spare time. Was it likely that they\r\nwould do so? Then, when the _conductor_ came to be employed as collector\r\nof rents and other dues on the estate, his opportunities of illicit\r\nexaction gave him more and more power over them; and, combined with their\r\nreluctance to migrate and sacrifice the fruits of past labour, reduced\r\nthem[1437] more and more to a state of _de facto_ dependence. At the\r\nworst they would be semi-servile in fact, though free in law; at the\r\nbest they would have this outlook, without any apparent alternative to\r\nescape their fate. This, I imagine, was the unhappy situation that was\r\nafterwards recognized by law.\r\n\r\nI must not omit to point out that I have said practically nothing\r\non the subject[1438] of municipal lands and their administration by\r\nthe authorities of the several _res publicae_ or _civitates_. Of the\r\nimportance of this matter I am well aware, more particularly in connexion\r\nwith the development of _emphyteusis_ under the perpetual leases granted\r\nby the municipalities. In a general history of the imperial economics\r\nthis topic would surely claim a significant place. But it seems to\r\nhave little or no bearing on the labour conditions with which I am\r\nprimarily concerned, while it would add greatly to the bulk of a treatise\r\nalready too long. So too the incidence of taxation, and the effects of\r\ndegradation[1439] of the currency, influences that both played a sinister\r\npart in imperial economics, belong properly to a larger theme. Even\r\nthe writers on land-surveying etc, the _agrimensores_ or _gromatici_,\r\nonly touch my subject here and there when it is necessary to speak of\r\ntenures, which cannot be ignored in relation to labour-questions. All\r\nthese matters are thoroughly and suggestively treated in Seeck’s great\r\nhistory of the Decline and Fall of the ancient world. Another topic\r\nleft out of discussion is the practical difference, if any, between\r\nthe terms[1440] _fundus_ and _saltus_ in the imperial domains. I can\r\nfind no satisfactory materials for defining it, and it does not appear\r\nto bear any relation to the labour-question. The meaning of the term\r\n_inquilinus_ is a more important matter. If we are to accept Seeck’s\r\ningenious conclusions[1441], it follows that this term, regularly used by\r\nthe jurists of a house-tenant (urban) as opposed to _colonus_ a tenant of\r\nland (rustic), in the course of the second century began to put on a new\r\nmeaning. Marcus settled large numbers of barbarians on Roman soil. These\r\n‘indwellers’ were labelled as _inquilini_, a word implying that they\r\nwere imported aliens, distinct from the proper residents. An analogous\r\ndistinction existed in municipalities between unprivileged ‘indwellers’\r\n(_incolae_) and real _municipes_. Now a jurist’s opinion[1442] in the\r\nfirst half of the third century speaks of _inquilini_ as attached\r\n(_adhaerent_) to landed estates, and only capable of being bequeathed\r\nto a legatee by inclusion in the landed estate: and it refers to a\r\nrescript of Marcus and Commodus dealing with a point of detail connected\r\nwith this rule of law. Thus the _inquilinate_ seems to have been a new\r\ncondition implying attachment to the soil, long before the _colonate_\r\nacquired a similar character. For the very few passages, in which the\r\nfixed and dependent nature of the colonate is apparently recognized\r\nbefore the time of Constantine, are with some reason suspected of having\r\nbeen tampered with by the compilers of the Digest, or are susceptible\r\nof a different interpretation. It is clear that this intricate question\r\ncannot be fully discussed here. If these rustic _inquilini_ were in their\r\norigin barbarian settlers, perhaps two conclusions regarding them may be\r\nreasonable. First, they seem to be distinct from slaves, the personal\r\nproperty of individual owners. For the evidence, so far as it goes,\r\nmakes them attached[1443] to the land, and only transferable therewith.\r\nSecondly, they are surely labourers, tilling with their own hands the\r\nholdings assigned to them. If this view of them be sound, we may see in\r\nthem the beginnings of a serf class. But it does not follow that the\r\nlater colonate was a direct growth from this beginning. We have noted\r\nabove several other causes contributing to that growth; in particular the\r\nstate of _de facto_ fixity combined with increasing dependence, in which\r\nthe free _colonus_ was gradually losing his freedom. Whether the later\r\ncolonate will ever receive satisfactory explanation in the form of a\r\nsimple and convincing theory, I cannot tell: at present it seems best to\r\nadmit candidly that, among the various influences tending to produce the\r\nknown result, I do not see my way[1444] to distinguish one as supremely\r\nimportant, and to ignore the effect of others. The opinion[1445] of de\r\nCoulanges, that the origin of the later colonate is mainly to be sought\r\nin the gradual effect of custom (local custom), eventually recognized\r\n(not created) by law, is perhaps the soundest attempt at a brief\r\nexpression of the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIX. THE JURISTS OF THE DIGEST.\r\n\r\nFor the position of the _colonus_ in Roman Law during the period known\r\nas that of the ‘classic’ Jurists we naturally find our chief source of\r\nevidence in the Digest. And it is not surprising that here and there we\r\nfind passages bearing on labour-questions more or less directly. But in\r\nusing this evidence it is most necessary to keep in mind the nature and\r\nscope of this great compilation. First, it is not a collection of laws.\r\nActual laws were placed in the Codex, based on previous Codes such as\r\nthe Theodosian (439 AD), after a careful process of sifting and editing,\r\nwith additions to complete the work. This great task was performed by\r\nJustinian’s commissioners in 14 months or less. The Justinian Code was\r\nconfirmed and published in 529 AD, and finally in a revised form rather\r\nmore than five years later. Secondly, the Digest is a collection of\r\nopinions of lawyers whose competence and authority had been officially\r\nrecognized, and whose _responsa_ carried weight in the Roman courts.\r\nFrom early times interpretation had been found indispensable in the\r\nadministration of the law; and in the course of centuries, both by\r\nopinions on cases and by formal treatises, there had grown up such a\r\nmass of written jurisprudence as no man could master. These writings\r\nwere specially copious in the ‘classic’ period (say from Hadrian to\r\nAlexander 117-235). Actual laws are sometimes cited in the form of\r\nimperial decisions, finally settling some disputed point. But the normal\r\nproduct of discussion is the opinion of this or that eminent jurist as\r\nto what is sound law in a particular question. The different opinions of\r\ndifferent authorities are often quoted side by side. If this were all, we\r\nmight congratulate ourselves on having simply a collection of authentic\r\nextracts from named authors, conveying their views in their own words.\r\nAnd no doubt many of the extracts are of this character.\r\n\r\nBut the position is not in fact so simple as this. Tribonian and his\r\nfellow-commissioners were set to work at the end of the year 530. Their\r\ntask was completed and the _Digesta_ published with imperial confirmation\r\nat the end of 533. Now the juristic literature in existence, of which\r\nthe Digest was to be an epitome superseding its own sources, was of such\r\nprodigious bulk that three years cannot have been sufficient for the\r\nwork. To read, abstract, classify, and so far as possible to harmonize,\r\nthis mass of complicated material, was a duty surely needing a much\r\nlonger time for its satisfactory performance. Moreover, as this official\r\nCorpus of jurisprudence was designed for reference and citation as an\r\nauthority in the courts, it had to be[1446] brought up to date. That\r\nthis necessity greatly increased the commissioners’ burden is obvious:\r\nnor less so, that it was a duty peculiarly difficult to discharge in\r\nhaste, and liable, if hurried, to result in obscurities inconsistencies\r\nand oversights. That much of the Digest has suffered from overhaste in\r\nits production is now generally admitted. Its evidence is therefore to\r\nbe used with caution. But on the subject of _coloni_ the main points of\r\ninterest are attested by witnesses of high authority, such as Ulpian, in\r\ncited passages not reasonably suspected of interpolation. And it is not\r\nnecessary to follow up a host of details. We have only to reconstruct\r\nfrom the law-sources the characteristic features of agriculture and\r\nrustic tenancy as it existed before the time of Diocletian; and these\r\nfeatures are on the whole significant and clear. Fortunately we are\r\nnot entirely dependent on collection and comparison of scattered\r\nreferences from all parts of the great compilation. One title (XIX 2\r\n_locati conducti_)[1447] furnishes us with a quantity of relevant matter\r\nclassified under one head by the editors themselves.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost it stands out quite clear that the _colonus_ is a\r\nfree man, who enters into a legal contract as lessee with lessor, and\r\nthat landlord and tenant are equally bound by the terms of the lease.\r\nIf any clause requires interpretation owing to special circumstances\r\nhaving arisen, the jurist endeavours to lay down the principles by which\r\nthe court should be guided to an equitable decision. For instance, any\r\nfact by which the productiveness of a farm and therewith the solvency\r\nof the tenant are impaired may lead to a dispute. Care is therefore\r\ntaken to relieve the tenant of responsibility for damage inflicted by\r\nirresistible force (natural or human)[1448] or due to the landlord’s\r\nfault. But defects of climate and soil[1449] give no claim to relief,\r\nsince he is presumed to have taken the farm with his eyes open: nor does\r\nthe failure of worn-out fruit trees, which tenants were regularly bound\r\nby their covenant to replace. The chief rights of the landlord[1450]\r\nare the proper cultivation of the farm and regular payment of the\r\nrent. In these the law duly protects him. The tenant is bound not to\r\nlet down the land by neglect, or to defraud[1451] the landlord by\r\nmisappropriating what does not belong to him: rent is secured normally\r\nby sureties (_fideiussores_)[1452] found by the tenant at the time of\r\nleasing, or sometimes by the fact that all property of his on the farm\r\nis expressly pledged[1453] to the lessor on this account. Thus it is the\r\naim of the law to guard the presumably poorer and humbler party against\r\nhard treatment, while it protects the man of property against fraud. In\r\nother words, it aims at strict enforcement of the terms[1454] of lease,\r\nwhile inclined to construe genuinely doubtful points or mistakes in\r\nfavour[1455] of the party bound. That landlord and tenant, even in cases\r\nof fixed money rent, have a certain community[1456] of interest, seems\r\nrecognized in the fact that some legal remedies against third persons\r\n(for malicious damage etc) could in some cases be employed[1457] by\r\neither landlord or tenant. In short, the latter is a thoroughly free and\r\nresponsible person.\r\n\r\nThat a tenant should be protected against disturbance[1458] was a matter\r\nof course. During the term of his lease he has a right to make his lawful\r\nprofit on the farm: the landlord is not only bound to allow him full\r\nenjoyment (_frui licere_), but to prevent molestation by a third party\r\nover whom he has control. Indeed the tenant farmer has in some relations\r\na more positive protection than the landlord himself. Thus a person\r\nwho has right of _usus_ over an estate may in certain circumstances\r\nrefuse[1459] to admit the _dominus_; but not the _colonus_ or his staff\r\nof slaves employed in the farm-work. Change of ownership can perhaps\r\nnever be a matter of indifference to the sitting tenant of a farm. But\r\nit is the lawyer’s aim to see that the passing of the property shall not\r\nimpair the tenant’s rights under his current lease. A lease sometimes\r\ncontained clauses fixing the terms (such as a money forfeit)[1460] on\r\nwhich the contract might be broken; in fact a cross-guarantee between\r\nthe parties, securing the tenant against damage by premature ejectment\r\nand the landlord against damage by the tenant’s premature quitting. The\r\njurists often appeal to local custom as a means of equitable decision on\r\ndisputed points. But one customary principle seems to be recognized[1461]\r\nas of general validity, the rule of _reconductio_. If, on expiration\r\nof a lease, the tenant holds on and the landlord allows him to remain,\r\nit is regarded as a renewal of the contract by bare agreement (_nudo\r\nconsensu_). No set form of lease is necessary; but this tacit contract\r\nholds good only from year to year. Another fact significant as to the\r\nposition of the _colonus_ is that he is assumed to have the right to\r\nsublet[1462] the farm: questions that would in that case arise are dealt\r\nwith as matters of course. I suppose that a lease might be so drawn as\r\nto bar any such right, but that in practice it was always or generally\r\nadmitted. Again, it is a sign of his genuinely independent position\r\nin the eye of the law that his own oath, if required of him, may be\r\naccepted[1463] as a counter-active plea (_exceptio iurisiurandi_) in his\r\nown defence, when sued by his landlord for damage done on the farm.\r\n\r\nOn the economic side we have first to remark that the _colonus_ is\r\nrepresented as normally a man of small means. It is true that in the\r\nDigest _conductor_ and _colonus_ are not clearly[1464] distinguished, as\r\nwe find them in the African inscriptions and in the later law. For the\r\nformer is simply the counterpart of _locator_, properly connoting the\r\nrelation between the contracting parties: _colonus_ expresses the fact\r\nthat the cultivation (_colere_) of land belonging to another devolves\r\nupon him by virtue of the contract. Every _colonus_ is a _conductor_,\r\nbut not every _conductor_ a _colonus_. Now custom, recognized by the\r\nlawyers, provided a means of supplying the small man’s need of capital.\r\nTo set him up in a farm, the landlord equipped him with a certain stock\r\n(_instrumentum_). This he took over at a valuation, not paying ready\r\nmoney for it, but accepting liability[1465] to account for the value at\r\nthe end of his tenancy. The stock or plant included[1466] implements\r\nand animals (oxen, slaves, etc), and a miscellaneous array of things,\r\nof course varying with the nature of the farm and local custom. To\r\nthis nucleus he had inevitably to add belongings[1467] of his own,\r\nwhich were likely to increase with time if the farm prospered in his\r\nhands. His rent[1468] might be either a fixed yearly payment in cash\r\nor produce, or a proportionate share of produce varying from year to\r\nyear. The money-rent[1469] seems to have been the usual plan, and it\r\nwas in connexion therewith that claims for abatement generally arose.\r\nThe impression left by the frequent references to _reliqua_ in the\r\nDigest, and the experiences of the younger Pliny, is that tenant-farmers\r\nin Italy were habitually behind with their rents and claiming[1470]\r\n_remissio_. This is probably true of the period (say) 100-250 AD, with\r\nwhich we are here concerned. It was probably a time of great difficulty\r\nfor both landlords and tenants, at least outside the range of suburban\r\nmarket-gardening. Signs are not lacking that want of sufficient\r\ncapital[1471] cramped the vigour of agriculture directly and indirectly.\r\nImprovements might so raise the standard of cultivation on an estate as\r\nto leave an awkward problem for the owner. Its upkeep on its present\r\nlevel might need a large capital; tenants of means were not easy to find,\r\nand subdivision into smaller holdings would not in all circumstances\r\nprovide a satisfactory solution. Moreover, if the man of means was not\r\nunlikely to act independently, in defiance of the landlord, the small man\r\nwas more likely to take opportunities of misappropriating things to which\r\nhe was not entitled.\r\n\r\nAll these difficulties, and others, suggest no great prosperity in\r\nItalian agriculture of the period. That on certain soils farming did not\r\npay, was as well known[1472] to the jurists as to other writers. And one\r\ngreat cause of agricultural decline appears in their incidental remarks\r\nas clearly as in literature. It was the devotion of much of the best land\r\nin the best situations to the unproductive parks and pleasure-grounds of\r\nthe rich. This can hardly be laid to the account of the still favoured\r\nfinancial position of Italy as compared with the Provinces, for we find\r\nthe same state of things existing late in the fourth century, when Italy\r\nhad long been provincialized and taxed accordingly. It was fashion, and\r\nfashion of long standing, that caused this evil. And this cause was\r\nitself an effect of the conditions of investment. The syndicates for\r\nexploiting provincial dues had gone with the Republic. State contracts\r\nand industrial enterprises were not enough to employ all the available\r\ncapital. The ownership of land, now that politics were not a school of\r\nambition, was more than ever the chief source of social importance. A\r\nman who could afford to own vast unremunerative estates was a great\r\npersonage. We may add that such estates, being unremunerative, were less\r\nlikely to attract the fatal attention of bad emperors, while good rulers\r\ndeliberately encouraged rich men to invest fortunes in them as being an\r\nevidence of loyalty to the government. The uneconomic rural conditions\r\nthus created are plainly referred to in the staid remarks of the jurists.\r\nWe read of estates owned for pleasure (_voluptaria praedia_)[1473]: of\r\ncases where it may be doubted[1474] whether the _fundus_ does not rather\r\nbelong to the _villa_ than the _villa_ to the _fundus_: and the use\r\nof the word _praetorium_[1475] (= great mansion, palace, ‘Court’) for\r\nthe lord’s headquarters on his demesne becomes almost official in the\r\nmouth of lawyers. Meanwhile great estates abroad could be, and were,\r\nprofitable to their owners, who drew rent from tenants and were normally\r\nnon-resident. Yet _praetoria_ were sometimes found even in the Provinces.\r\n\r\nIn connexion with this topic it is natural to consider the questions of\r\nupkeep and improvements. The former is simple. As the tenant has the\r\ndisposal of the crops raised and gathered (_fructus_), he is bound[1476]\r\nto till the soil, to keep up the stock of plants, and to see that the\r\ndrainage of the farm is in working order. Further detail is unnecessary,\r\nas his liability must be gauged by the state of the farm when he took\r\nit over. Improvements look to the future. From the lawyers we get only\r\nthe legal point of view, which is of some interest as proving that\r\nthe subject was of sufficient importance not to be overlooked. Now it\r\nseems certain that a _conductor_ or _colonus_ had a right of action to\r\nrecover[1477] from the _dominus_ not only compensation for unexhausted\r\nimprovements, but his whole outlay on them, if shewn to have been\r\nbeneficial. Or his claim might rest on the fact that the project had\r\nbeen approved[1478] by the landlord. But it might happen that a work\r\nbeneficial to the particular estate was detrimental to a neighbouring\r\none. In such a case, against whom—landlord or tenant—had the owner of\r\nthat estate a legal remedy? It was held that, if the tenant had carried\r\nout the work in question[1479] without his landlord’s knowledge, he\r\nalone was liable. If, as some held, the landlord was bound to provide a\r\nparticular remedy, he could recover the amount paid under this head from\r\nhis tenant. To insure the owner against loss from the acts of his lessee\r\nwas evidently an object of the first importance, and this is in harmony\r\nwith the Roman lawyers’ intense respect for rights of property. The\r\ngeneral impression left on the reader of their utterances on this subject\r\nis that a landlord, after providing a considerable _instrumentum_, had\r\ndone all that could reasonably be expected from him. Improvements,\r\nthe desirability of which was usually discovered through the tenant’s\r\nexperience, were normally regarded as the tenant’s business: it was only\r\nnecessary to prevent the landlord from arbitrarily confiscating what the\r\ntenant had done to improve his property. Obviously such ‘improvements’\r\nwere likely to occasion disputes as to the value of the work done: but it\r\nwas the custom of the countryside to refer technical questions of this\r\nkind to the arbitration of an impartial umpire (_vir bonus_), no doubt a\r\nneighbour familiar with local circumstances. On the whole, it does not\r\nappear that the law treated the _colonus_ badly under this head, and the\r\ndifficulty of securing good tenants may be supposed to have guaranteed\r\nhim against unfair administration.\r\n\r\nA great many more details illustrating the position of _coloni_ as they\r\nappear in the Digest could be added here, but I think the above will be\r\nfound ample for my purpose. The next topic to be dealt with is that of\r\nlabour, so far as the references of the lawyers give us any information.\r\nFirst it is to be noted that the two systems[1480] of estate-management,\r\nthat of cultivation for landlord’s account by his _actor_ or _vilicus_,\r\nand that of letting to tenant farmers, were existing side by side. The\r\nlatter plan was to all appearance more commonly followed than it would\r\nseem to have been in the time of Columella, but the former was still\r\nworking. A confident opinion as to the comparative frequency[1481] of\r\nthe two systems is hardly to be formed on Digest evidence: for in rustic\r\nmatters the interest of lawyers was almost solely concerned with the\r\nrelations of landlord and tenant. What an owner did with his own property\r\non his own account was almost entirely his own business. There are signs\r\nthat a certain change in the traditional nomenclature represents a real\r\nchange of function in the case of landlords’ managers. The term _actor_\r\nis superseding[1482] _vilicus_, but the _vilicus_ still remains. He would\r\nseem to be now more of a mere farm-bailiff, charged with the cultivation\r\nof some part or parts of an estate that are not let to tenants. It\r\nmay even be that he is left with a free hand and only required to pay\r\na fixed[1483] yearly return. If so, this arrangement is not easily\r\nto be distinguished from the case of a slave _colonus_ or _quasi\r\ncolonus_[1484] occupying a farm. The financial and general supervision\r\nof the estate is in the hands of the _actor_[1485], who collects all\r\ndues, including rents of _colonie_ and is held to full account[1486] for\r\nall these receipts as well as for the contents of the store-rooms. He\r\nis a slave, but a valuable and trusted man: it is significant that the\r\nmanumission[1487] of _actores_ is not seldom mentioned. Evidently the\r\nqualities looked for in such an agent were observed to develope most\r\nreadily under a prospect of freedom. But, so long as he remained _actor_\r\nof an estate, he could be regarded as part of it: in a bequest the\r\ntestator could include him as a part[1488], and often did so: and indeed\r\nhis peculiar knowledge of local detail must often have been an important\r\nelement in its value. To employ such a person in the management of an\r\nestate, with powerful inducements to good conduct, may have solved many\r\na difficult problem. We may perhaps guess that it made the employment of\r\na qualified legal agent (_procurator_) less often necessary, at least if\r\nthe _actor_ contrived to avoid friction with his master’s free tenants.\r\n\r\nWhether an estate was farmed for the owner by his manager, or let to\r\ntenants, or partly on one system partly on the other, it is clear\r\nthat slave-labour is assumed as the normal basis of working. For the\r\n_colonus_ takes over slaves supplied by the _dominus_ as an item of\r\nthe _instrumentum_. And there was nothing to prevent him from adding\r\nslaves of his own, if he could afford it and thought it worth his while\r\nto employ a larger staff. Whether such additions were often or ever\r\nmade, we must not expect the lawyers to tell us; but we do now and then\r\nhear[1489] of a slave who is the tenant’s own. Such a slave might as\r\npart of the tenant’s goods be pledged to the landlord as security for\r\nhis rent, but he would not be a part of the estate of which the landlord\r\ncould dispose by sale or bequest. In such a case the slaves might be\r\nregarded[1490] as accessories of the _fundus_, if it were so agreed. This\r\nraised questions as to the degree of connexion that should be treated\r\nas qualifying a slave to be considered an appurtenance of a farm. The\r\nanswer was in effect that he must be a member of the regular staff. Mere\r\ntemporary employment on the place did not so attach him, mere temporary\r\nabsence on duty elsewhere did not detach him. A further question was\r\nwhether all slaves in any sort of employment on the place were included,\r\nor only such as were actually engaged in farm work proper, cultivation\r\nof the soil, not those employed in various subsidiary[1491] industries.\r\nThese questions the jurists discussed fully, but we cannot follow them\r\nhere, as their legal importance is chiefly in connexion with property\r\nand can hardly have affected seriously the position of tenants. But it\r\nis interesting to observe that the lawyers were feeling the necessity of\r\nattempting some practical classification. The distinction[1492] between\r\n_urbana_ and _rustica mancipia_ was old enough as a loose conversational\r\nor literary one. But, when rights of inheritance or legacy of such\r\nvaluable property were involved, it became important to define (if\r\npossible) the essential characteristics of a ‘rustic’ slave.\r\n\r\nThat the condition of the rustic slave was improving, and generally far\r\nbetter than it had been on the _latifundia_ of Republican days, seems\r\nindicated by the jurists’ speaking of a slave as _colonus_ or _quasi\r\ncolonus_ without any suggestion of strangeness in the relation. We may\r\nassume that only slaves of exceptional capacity and merit would be placed\r\nin a position of economic (if not legal) equality with free tenants.\r\nStill the growth of such a custom can hardly have been without some\r\neffect on the condition of rustic slaves in general. It was not new in\r\nthe second century: it is referred to by a jurist[1493] of the Augustan\r\nage. The increasing difficulty of getting either good tenants or good\r\nslaves no doubt induced landlords to entrust farms to men who could and\r\nwould work them profitably, whether freemen or slaves. And a slave had\r\nin agriculture, as in trades and finance, a point in his favour: his\r\nperson and his goods[1494] remained in his master’s power. If by skilled\r\nand honest management he relieved his master of trouble and worry, and\r\ncontributed by regular payment of rent to assure his income, it was\r\nreasonable to look for gratitude expressed, on the usual Roman lines, in\r\nhis master’s will. Manumission, perhaps accompanied by bequest[1495] of\r\nthe very farm that he had worked so well, was a probable reward. May we\r\nnot guess that some of the best farming carried on in Italy under the\r\nearlier Empire was achieved by trusted slaves, in whom servile apathy was\r\novercome by hope? Such a farmer-slave would surely have under him[1496]\r\nslave labourers, the property of his master; and he would have the\r\nstrongest possible motives for tact and skill in their management, while\r\nhis own capacity had been developed by practical experience. I can point\r\nto no arrangement in Roman agriculture so calculated to make it efficient\r\non a basis of slavery as this.\r\n\r\nThe services (_operae_) of a slave, due to his owner or to some one in\r\nplace of his owner, were a property capable of valuation, and therefore\r\ncould be let and hired at a price. That is, the person to whom they\r\nwere due could commute[1497] them for a _merces_. This might, as in the\r\ncorresponding Greek case of ἀποφορά, be a paying business, if a slave had\r\nbeen bought cheap and trained so as to earn good wages. It was common\r\nenough in various trades: what concerns us is that the plan was evidently\r\nin use in the rustic world also. Now this is notable. We naturally ask,\r\nif the man’s services were worth so much to the hirer, why should they\r\nnot have been worth as much (or even a little more) to his own master?\r\nWhy should it pay to let him rather than to use him yourself? Of course\r\nthe owner might have more slaves than he needed at the moment: or the\r\nhirer might be led by temporary need of labour to offer a fancy price\r\nfor the accommodation: or two masters on neighbouring farms might engage\r\nin a reciprocity of cross-hirings to suit their mutual convenience at\r\ncertain seasons. Further possibilities might be suggested, but are such\r\noccasional explanations sufficient to account for the prevalence of this\r\nhiring-system? I think not. Surely the principal influence, steadily\r\noperating in this direction, was one that implied an admission of the\r\neconomic failure of slavery. If A’s slave worked for B so well that\r\nit paid A to let him do so and to receive a rent for his services, it\r\nfollows that the slave had some inducement to exert his powers more fully\r\nas B’s hireling than in the course of ordinary duty under his own master.\r\nEither the nature and conditions of the work under B were pleasanter,\r\nor he received something for himself over and above the stipulated sum\r\nclaimed by his master. In other words, as a mere slave he did not do his\r\nbest: as a hired man he felt some of the stimulus that a free man gets\r\nfrom the prospect of his wage. So Slavery, already philanthropically\r\nquestioned, was in this confession economically condemned.\r\n\r\nThese points considered, we are not surprised to find mention of slaves\r\nletting out their own[1498] _operae_. This must imply the consent of\r\ntheir masters, and it is perhaps not rash to see in such a situation\r\na sign of weakening in the effective authority of masters. A master\r\nwhose interest is bound up with the fullest development of his slave’s\r\npowers (as rentable property exposed to competition) will hardly act the\r\nmartinet without forecasting the possible damage to his own pocket. A\r\nslave who knows that his master draws an income from his efficiency is\r\nin a strong position for gradually extorting privileges till he attains\r\nno small degree of independence. We may perhaps find traces of such an\r\nadvance in the arrangement by which a slave hires his own _operae_[1499]\r\nfrom his master. He will thus make a profit out of hiring himself: in\r\nfact he is openly declaring that he will not work at full power for his\r\nmaster, but only compound with him for output on the scale of an ordinary\r\nslave. This arrangement was common in arts and handicrafts, and not\r\nspecially characteristic of Rome. In rustic life, the slave put into a\r\nfarm as tenant[1500] at a fixed rent, and taking profit and loss, may\r\nfurnish an instance. Whether such cases were frequent we do not know.\r\nThe general impression left by the Digest passages on hiring and letting\r\nof slaves is that, when we read of _mercennarii_, it is generally if not\r\nalways hireling[1501] slaves, not free wage-earners, that are meant.\r\nIn a passage[1502] where _servus_ occurs as well as _mercennarius_, it\r\nis reference to the owner as well as to the hirer that necessitates\r\nthe addition. If I have interpreted these points aright, the picture\r\nsuggested is a state of things in which the rustic slave was steadily\r\nimproving his position, supplying hired labour, at times entrusted with\r\nthe charge of a farm, and with a fair prospect of becoming by manumission\r\nunder his owner’s will a free _colonus_, or even his own landlord. How\r\nfar this picture is really characteristic of rustic Italy, or of the\r\nProvinces (such as Gaul or Spain), is what one would like to know, but I\r\ncan find no evidence.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing paragraphs I have refrained from inquiring whether the\r\n_colonus_ as he appears in the Digest was a farmer who worked with his\r\nown hands, or merely an employer and director of labour. The reason is\r\nthat I have found in the texts no evidence whatever on the point. It was\r\nnot the jurist’s business. We are left to guess at the truth as best\r\nwe may, and we can only start from consideration of the farmer’s own\r\ninterest, and assume that the average farmer knew his own interest and\r\nwas guided thereby. Now, being bound to pay rent in some form or other\r\nand to make good any deficiencies in the _instrumentum_ at the end of\r\nhis tenancy, he had every inducement to get all he could out of the land\r\nwhile he held it. How best to do this, was his problem. And the answer\r\nno doubt varied according to the size of the farm, the kind of crops\r\nthat could profitably be raised there, and the number and quality of the\r\nstaff. In some rough operations, his constant presence on one spot and\r\nsharing the actual work might get the most out of his men. Where nicety\r\nof skill was the main thing, he might better spend his time in direction\r\nand minute watching of the hands. On a fairly large farm he would have\r\nenough to do as director. We may reasonably guess that he only toiled\r\nwith his own hands if he thought it would pay him to do so. This _a\r\npriori_ guesswork is not satisfactory. But I see nothing else to be said;\r\nfor the African inscriptions do not help us. The circumstances of those\r\ngreat domains were exceptional.\r\n\r\nSo far we have been viewing agriculture as proceeding in times and under\r\nconditions assumed to be more or less normal, without taking account of\r\nthe various disturbing elements in rustic life, by which both landlords\r\nand tenants were liable to suffer vexation and loss. Yet these were not a\r\nfew. Even a lawyer could not ignore wild beasts. Wolves carried off some\r\nof A’s pigs. Dogs kept by B, _colonus_ of a neighbouring _villa_, for\r\nprotection of his own flocks, rescued the pigs. A legal question[1503] at\r\nonce arises: are the rescued pigs regarded as wild game, and therefore\r\nbelonging to the owner of the dogs? No, says the jurist. They were still\r\nwithin reach; A had not given them up for lost; if B tries to retain\r\nthem, the law provides remedies to make him give them up. I presume that\r\nB would have a claim to some reward for his services. But the lawyer is\r\nsilent, confining his opinion to the one question of property. References\r\nto depredations of robbers or brigands (_latrones_, _grassatores_,) occur\r\noften, and quite as a matter of course. The police of rural Italy, not to\r\nmention the Provinces, was an old scandal. Stock-thieves, who lifted a\r\nfarmer’s cattle sheep or goats, and sometimes his crops, were important\r\nenough to have a descriptive name (_abigei_)[1504] and a title of the\r\nDigest to themselves. That bad neighbours made themselves unpleasant in\r\nmany ways, and that their presence gave a bad name to properties near\r\nthem, was an experience of all lands and all ages: but the jurists treat\r\nit gravely[1505] as a lawyer’s matter. Concealment of such a detrimental\r\nfact[1506] by the seller of an estate made the sale voidable. The rich\r\n(old offenders in this kind) were by a rescript of Hadrian[1507] awarded\r\ndifferential punishment for removing landmarks: in their case the purpose\r\nof encroachment was not a matter open to doubt.\r\n\r\nIn one connexion the use of force as an embarrassing feature of rustic\r\nlife was a subject of peculiar interest to the jurists, and had long\r\nbeen so. This was in relation to questions of possession. In Roman law\r\n_possessio_ held a very important place. All that need be said of it here\r\nis that the fact of possession, or lack of it, seriously affected the\r\nposition of litigants in disputes as to property. Great ingenuity was\r\nexercised in definition and in laying down rules for ascertaining the\r\nfact. Now among the means employed in gaining or recovering possession\r\nnone was more striking or more effective than the use of force.\r\nSpecial legal remedies had been provided to deal with such violence;\r\n_interdicta_ issued by the praetor, to forbid it, or to reinstate a\r\nclaimant dislodged by his rival, or simply to state the exact issue\r\nraised in a particular case. On conformity or disobedience to the\r\npraetor’s order the case was formally tried in court: the question of\r\nlaw mainly turned on questions of fact. What concerns us is that force\r\nwas solemnly classified under two heads, _vis_ and _vis armata_. Each\r\nof these had its own proper interdict at least as early as the time of\r\nCicero, and they occupy a whole title[1508] in the Digest. Clearly the\r\nuse of force was no negligible matter. That it was a danger or at least\r\na nuisance to owners or claimants of _property_, is not less clear.\r\nBut how did it touch the _colonus_? He was, as such, neither owner nor\r\nclaimant of the property of his farm. He had in his own capacity[1509] no\r\n_possession_ either. But, as tenant of a particular owner, his presence\r\noperated[1510] to secure the possession of his landlord. Hence to oust\r\nhim by force broke the landlord’s possession; whether rightly or wrongly,\r\nthe law had to decide. Now it is obvious that, in cases where serious\r\naffrays resulted from intrusion, a tenant might suffer grave damage to\r\nhis goods and person. The intruders (often a gang of slaves) would seldom\r\nbe so punctiliously gentle as to do no harm at all. Therefore, having\r\nregard to the amount of interest in this subject shewn by the lawyers, we\r\ncannot omit the use of force in matters of possession from the list of\r\nrustic embarrassments.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of annoyance was connected with servitudes, such as rights\r\nof way and water, which were frequent subjects of dispute in country\r\ndistricts. Whether regarded as rights or as burdens, the principles\r\ngoverning them were a topic that engaged the minute and laborious\r\nattention[1511] of the lawyers. Now it is evident that a right of way or\r\nwater through an estate, though a material advantage to a neighbouring\r\nestate served by the convenience, might be a material disadvantage to\r\nthe one over which the right extended. Also that the annoyance might be\r\nindefinitely increased or lessened by the cantankerous or considerate\r\nuser of the right by the person or persons enjoying it. When we consider\r\nthat servitudes were already an important department of jurisprudence in\r\nRepublican days, and see how great a space they occupy in the Digest, we\r\ncan hardly resist the conclusion that country proprietors found in them\r\na fertile subject of quarrels. But surely the quarrels of landlords over\r\na matter of this kind could not be carried on without occasional and\r\nperhaps frequent disturbances and injury to the tenants on the land. Even\r\nif the law provided means of getting compensation for any damage done to\r\na tenant’s crops or other goods in the course of attempts to enforce or\r\ndefeat a claimed servitude, was the average _colonus_ a man readily to\r\nseek compensation in the law-courts? I think not. But, if not, he would\r\ndepend solely on the goodwill of his own landlord, supposing the latter\r\nto have got the upper hand in the main dispute. On the whole, I strongly\r\nsuspect that in practice these quarrels over rustic servitudes were a\r\ngreater nuisance to farmers than might be supposed. So far as I know, we\r\nhave no statement of the farmer’s point of view. Another intermittent\r\nbut damaging occurrence was the occasional passage of soldiery, whose\r\ndiscipline was often lax. We might easily forget the depredations and\r\ngeneral misconduct of these unruly ruffians, and imagine that such\r\nannoyances only became noticeable in a later period. But the jurists\r\ndo not allow us to forget[1512] the military requisitions for supply\r\nof troops on the march, the payment for which is not clearly provided,\r\nand would at best be a cause of trouble; or the pilferings of the men,\r\ncompensation for which was probably not to be had. It would be farmers in\r\nnorthern Italy and the frontier-provinces that were the chief sufferers.\r\n\r\nDamage by natural disturbances or by fires may happen in any age or\r\ncountry. That Italy in particular was exposed to the effect of floods and\r\nearthquakes, we know. Accordingly the lawyers are seriously concerned\r\nwith the legal and equitable questions arising out of such events. It was\r\nnot merely the claim of tenants[1513] to abatement of rent that called\r\nfor a statement of principles. Beside the sudden effects of earthquakes\r\ntorrents or fires, there were the slower processes of streams changing\r\ntheir courses[1514] and gradual land-slides on the slopes of hills. These\r\nmovements generally affected the proprietary relations of neighbouring\r\nlandlords, taking away land from one, sometimes giving to another.\r\nHere was a fine opening for ingenious jurists, of which they took full\r\nadvantage. The growth of estates by alluvion, and loss by erosion, was\r\na favourite topic, the operation of which, and the questions thereby\r\nraised, are so earnestly treated as to shew their great importance in\r\ncountry life. Of fire-damage, due to malice or neglect, no more need be\r\nsaid; nor of many other minor matters.\r\n\r\nBut, when all the above drawbacks have been allowed for, it is still\r\nprobably true that scarcity of labour was a far greater difficulty for\r\nfarmers. We hear very little directly of this trouble, as it raised no\r\npoint of law. Very significant[1515] however are the attempts of the\r\nSenate and certain emperors to put down an inveterate scandal which\r\nis surely good indirect evidence of the scarcity. It consisted in the\r\nharbouring[1516] of runaway slaves on the estates of other landlords. A\r\nrunaway from one estate was of course not protected and fed on another\r\nestate from motives of philanthropy. The slave would be well aware that\r\nsevere punishment awaited him if recovered by his owner, and therefore\r\nbe willing to work for a new master who might, if displeased, surrender\r\nhim any day. The landlords guilty of this treason to the interests\r\nof their class were probably the same as those who harboured[1517]\r\nbrigands, another practice injurious to peaceful agriculture both in\r\nItaly and abroad. Another inconvenience, affecting all trades and all\r\nparts of the empire in various degrees, was the local difference in\r\nthe money-value[1518] of commodities in different markets. This was\r\nsometimes great: and that it was troublesome to farmers may be inferred\r\nfrom the particular mention of wine oil and corn as cases in point. No\r\ndoubt dealers had the advantage over producers, as they generally have,\r\nthrough possessing a more than local knowledge of necessary facts. These\r\nmiddlemen however could not be dispensed with, as experience shewed,\r\nand one of the later jurists[1519] openly recognized. Facilities for\r\nborrowing, and rates of interest, varied greatly in various centres.\r\nBut all these market questions do not seem to have been so acute as to\r\nbe a public danger until the ruinous debasement of the currency in the\r\ntime of Gallienus. A few references may be found to peculiar usages of\r\ncountry life in particular Provinces. Thus we read that in Arabia[1520]\r\nfarms were sometimes ‘boycotted,’ any person cultivating such a farm\r\nbeing threatened with assassination. In Egypt[1521] special care had to\r\nbe taken to protect the dykes regulating the distribution of Nile water.\r\nBoth these offences were summarily dealt with by the provincial governor,\r\nand the penalty was death. Here we have one more proof of the anxiety of\r\nthe imperial government to insure the greatest possible production of\r\nfood. The empire was always hungry,—and so were the barbarians. And the\r\nnorthern frontier provinces could not feed both themselves and the armies.\r\n\r\nWhile speaking of landlords and tenants we must not forget that all over\r\nthe empire considerable areas of land were owned by municipalities,\r\nand dealt with at the discretion of the local authorities. Variety of\r\nsystems was no doubt dictated by variety of local circumstances: but\r\none characteristic was so general as to deserve special attention on the\r\npart of jurists. This was the system of perpetual leaseholds[1522] at\r\na fixed (and undoubtedly beneficial) rent, heritable and transferable\r\nto assigns. So long as the tenant regularly paid the _vectigal_, his\r\noccupation was not to be disturbed. It was evidently the desire of the\r\nmunicipal authorities to have a certain income to reckon with: for the\r\nsake of certainty they would put up with something less than a rack-rent.\r\nThere were also other lands owned by these _civitates_ that were let on\r\nthe system[1523] in use by private landlords; the normal term probably\r\nbeing five years. Of these no more need be said here. Beneficial leases\r\nunder a municipality were liable to corrupt management. It had been found\r\nnecessary[1524] to disqualify members of the local Senate (_decuriones_)\r\nfrom holding such leases, that they might not share out the common lands\r\namong themselves on beneficial terms. But this prohibition was not\r\nenough. The town worthies put in men of straw[1525] as nominal tenants,\r\nthrough whom they enjoyed the benefits of the leases. So this evasion\r\nalso had to be met by revoking the ill-gotten privilege. But disturbance\r\nof tenancies was not to be lightly allowed, so it appears that a\r\nreference to the emperor[1526] was necessary before such revocation\r\ncould take place. This system of perpetual leases is of interest, not\r\nas indicating different methods of cultivation from those practised on\r\nprivate estates, but as betraying a tendency to fixity[1527] already\r\nexisting, destined to spread and to take other forms, and to become\r\nthe fatal characteristic of the later Empire. Another striking piece\r\nof evidence in the same direction occurs in connexion with the lessees\r\n(_publicani_) of various state dues (_vectigalia publica_) farmed out\r\nin the usual way. In the first half of the third century the jurist\r\nPaulus attests[1528] the fact that, in case it was found that the right\r\nof collecting such dues, hitherto very profitable to the lessees, could\r\nonly be let at a lower lump sum than hitherto, the old lessees were held\r\nbound to continue their contract at the old price. But Callistratus,\r\ncontemporary or nearly so, tells us that this was not so, and\r\nquotes[1529] a rescript of Hadrian (117-138 AD) condemning the practice\r\nas tyrannical and likely to deter men from entering into so treacherous\r\na bargain. It appears that other[1530] emperors had forbidden it, but\r\nthere is no proof that they succeeded in stopping it. At all events\r\nthe resort to coercion in a matter of contract like this reveals the\r\npresence of a belief in compulsory fixity, ominous of the coming imperial\r\nparalysis, though of course not so understood at the time. It did not\r\ndirectly affect agriculture as yet; but its application to agriculture\r\nwas destined to be a symptom and a cause of the empire’s decline and fall.\r\n\r\nAnother group of tenancies, the number and importance of which was\r\nquietly increasing, was that known as _praedia Caesaris_[1531], _fundi\r\nfiscales_, and so forth. We need not discuss the departmental differences\r\nand various names of these estates. The tenants, whether small men or\r\n_conductores_ on a large scale who sublet in parcels[1532] to _coloni_,\r\nheld either directly or indirectly from the emperor. We have seen\r\nspecimens in Africa, the Province in which the crown-properties were\r\nexceptionally large. What chiefly concerns us here is the imperial\r\nland-policy. It seems clear that its first aim was to keep these estates\r\npermanently occupied by good solvent tenants. The surest means to this\r\nend was to give these estates a good name, to create a general impression\r\nthat on imperial farms a man had a better chance of thriving than on\r\nthose of average private landlords. Now the ‘state,’ that is the emperor\r\nor his departmental chiefs, could favour crown-tenants in various ways\r\nwithout making a material sacrifice of a financial kind. In particular,\r\nthe treatment of crown-estates as what we call ‘peculiars,’ in which\r\nlocal disputes were settled, not by resort to the courts of ordinary law,\r\nbut administratively[1533] by the emperor’s _procuratores_, was probably\r\na great relief; above all to the humbler _coloni_, whom we may surely\r\nassume to have been a class averse to litigation. No doubt a _procurator_\r\nmight be corrupted and unjust. But he was probably far more effectually\r\nwatched than ordinary magistrates; and, if the worst came to the worst,\r\nthere was as we have seen the hope of a successful appeal to the emperor.\r\nAnother favour consisted in the exemption of Caesar’s tenants from\r\nvarious burdensome official duties in municipalities, the so-called\r\n_munera_, which often entailed great expense. This is mentioned by a\r\njurist[1534] near the end of the second century: they are only to perform\r\nsuch duties so far as not to cause loss to the treasury. Another[1535],\r\nsomewhat later, says that their exemption is granted in order that\r\nthey may be more suitable tenants of treasury-farms. This exemption is\r\none more evidence of the well-known fact that in this age municipal\r\noffices were beginning to be evaded[1536] as ruinous, and no longer\r\nsought as an honour. We must note that, if this _immunitas_ relieved\r\nthe crown-tenants, it left all the more burdens to be borne by those who\r\nenjoyed no such relief. And this cannot have been good for agriculture in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that the _fiscus_[1537] was a slack and easy\r\nlandlord. Goods of debtors were promptly seized to cover liabilities:\r\nattempts to evade payment of _tributa_ by a private agreement[1538]\r\nbetween mortgagor and mortgagee were quashed: a rescript[1539] of Marcus\r\nand Verus insisted on the treasury share (½) of treasure trove: and\r\nso on. But there are signs of a reasonable and considerate policy, in\r\nnot pressing demands so as to inflict hardship. Trajan[1540] had set a\r\ngood example, and good emperors followed it. We may fairly guess that\r\nthis moderation in financial dealings was not wholly laid aside in\r\nthe management of imperial estates. Nor is it to be imagined that the\r\nadvantages of imperial tenants were exactly the same in all parts of the\r\nempire. In Provinces through which armies had to move it is probable that\r\n_coloni Caesaris_ would suffer less[1541] than ordinary farmers from\r\nmilitary annoyances. But on the routes to and from a seat of war it is\r\nobvious that the imperial post-service would be subjected to exceptional\r\nstrain. Now this service was at the best of times[1542] a cause of\r\nvexations and losses to the farmers along the line of traffic. The\r\nstaff made good all deficiencies in their requirements by taking beasts\r\nfodder vehicles etc wherever they could find them: what they restored\r\nwas much the worse for wear, and compensation, if ever got, was tardy\r\nand inadequate. The repair of roads was another pretext for exaction.\r\nIt is hardly to be doubted that in these respects imperial tenants\r\nsuffered less than others. Some emperors[1543] took steps to ease the\r\nburden, which had been found too oppressive to the roadside estates. But\r\nthis seems to have been no more than relief from official requisitions:\r\nirregular ‘commandeering’ was the worst evil, and we have no reason to\r\nthink that it was effectually suppressed. It appears in the next period\r\nas a rampant abuse, vainly forbidden by the laws of the Theodosian code.\r\n\r\n\r\nL. THE LATER COLONATE, ITS PLACE IN ROMAN HISTORY.\r\n\r\nIn the endeavour to extract from scattered and fragmentary evidence\r\nsome notion of agricultural conditions in the Roman empire before and\r\nafter Diocletian we are left with two imperfect pictures, so strongly\r\ncontrasted as to suggest a suspicion of their truth. We can hardly\r\nbelieve that the system known as the later Colonate appeared in full\r\nforce as a sudden phenomenon. Nor indeed are we compelled to fly so\r\ndirectly in the face of historical experience. That we have no narrative\r\nof the steps that led to this momentous change, is surely due to the\r\ninability of contemporaries to discern the future effect of tendencies\r\noperating silently[1544] and piecemeal. What seems at the moment\r\ninsignificant, even if observed, is seldom recorded, and very seldom\r\nintentionally. Hence after generations, seeking to trace effects to\r\ncauses, are puzzled by defects of record. Their only resource is to\r\nsupplement, so far as possible, defective record by general consideration\r\nof the history of the time in question and cautious inference therefrom:\r\nin fact to get at the true meaning of fragmentary admissions in relation\r\nto their historical setting. The chief topic to be dealt with here from\r\nthis point of view is the character of the Roman Empire in several\r\naspects. For among all the anxieties of the government during these\r\ntroubled centuries the one that never ceased was the fear of failure in\r\nsupplies of food.\r\n\r\nThe character of the Roman Empire had been largely determined by the\r\nfact that it arose from the overthrow of a government that had long\r\nbeen practically aristocratic. The popular movements that contributed\r\nto this result only revealed the impossibility of establishing anything\r\nlike a democracy, and the unreality of any power save the power of the\r\nsword. The great dissembler Augustus concealed a virtual autocracy by\r\nconciliatory handling of the remains of the nobility. But the Senate, to\r\nwhich he left or gave many powers, was never capable of bearing a vital\r\npart in the administration, and its influence continued to dwindle under\r\nhis successors. The master of the army was the master of the empire,\r\nand influence was more and more vested in those who were able to guide\r\nhis policy. That these might be, and sometimes were, not born Romans at\r\nall, but imperial freedmen generally of Greek or mixed-Greek origin,\r\nwas a very significant fact. In particular, it marked and encouraged\r\nthe growth of departmental bureaus, permanent and efficient beyond the\r\nstandard of previous Roman experience. But the price of this efficiency\r\nwas centralization, a condition that carried with it inevitable dangers,\r\nowing to the vast extent of the empire. In modern times the fashionable\r\nremedy suggested for over-centralization is devolution of powers to local\r\ngovernments controlling areas of considerable size. Or, in cases of\r\naggregation, the existing powers left to states merged in a confederation\r\nare considerable. In any case, the subordinate units are free to act\r\nwithin their several limited spheres, and the central government\r\nrespects their ‘autonomy,’ only interfering in emergencies to enforce the\r\nfulfilment of definite common obligations.\r\n\r\nBut, if it had been desired to gain any such relief by a system of\r\ndevolution within the Roman empire, this would have meant the recognition\r\nof ‘autonomy’ in the Provinces. And this was inconceivable. The extension\r\nof Roman dominion had been achieved by dividing Rome’s adversaries. Once\r\nconquered, it was the interest or policy of the central power to keep\r\nthem in hand by preventing the growth of self-conscious cohesion in the\r\nseveral units. Each Province was, as the word implied, a department of\r\nthe Roman system, ruled by a succession of Roman governors. It looked to\r\nRome for orders, for redress of grievances, for protection at need. If\r\nthe advance of Rome destroyed no true nations, her government at least\r\nmade the development of truly national characteristics impossible, while\r\nshe herself formed no Roman nation. Thus, for better or worse, the empire\r\nwas _non-national_. But, as we have already seen, the decline of Italy\r\nmade it more and more clear that the strength of the empire lay in the\r\nProvinces. Now, having no share in initiative and no responsibility, the\r\nProvinces steadily lost vitality under Roman civilization, and became\r\nmore and more helplessly dependent on the central power. As the strain on\r\nthe empire became greater, the possibility of relief by devolution grew\r\nless: but more centralization was no cure for what was already a disease.\r\n\r\nThat local government of a kind existed in the empire is true enough;\r\nalso that it was one of the most striking and important features of\r\nthe system. But it was municipal, and tended rather to subdivide than\r\nto unite. It was the outcome of a civilization profoundly urban in\r\nits origins and ideas. The notion that a city was a state was by no\r\nmeans confined to the independent cities of early Greece. Whether it\r\nvoluntarily merged itself in a League or lived on as a subordinate unit\r\nin the system of a dominant power, the city and its territory were\r\npolitically one. Within their several boundaries the townsmen and rustic\r\ncitizens of each city were subject to the authorities of that community.\r\nBeyond their own boundary they were aliens under the authorities of\r\nanother city. It is no wonder that jealousies between neighbour cities\r\nwere often extreme, and that Roman intervention was often needed to keep\r\nthe peace between rivals. But the system suited Roman policy. In the East\r\nand wherever cities existed they were taken over as administrative units\r\nand as convenient centres of taxation: in the West it was found useful\r\nand practicable to introduce urban centres into tribes and cantons, and\r\neven in certain districts to attach[1545] local populations to existing\r\ncities as dependent hamlets. And, so long as the imperial government\r\nwas able to guard the frontiers and avert the shock of disturbances of\r\nthe Roman peace, the empire held its own in apparent prosperity. To\r\nsome historians the period of the ‘Antonines’ (say about 100-170 AD)\r\nhas seemed a sort of Golden Age. But signs are not lacking that the\r\nmunicipal system had seen its best days. The severe strain on imperial\r\nresources in the time of Marcus left behind it general exhaustion.\r\nThe decay of local patriotism marked the pressure of poverty and loss\r\nof vitality in the cities. More and more their importance became that\r\nof mere taxation-centres, in which the evasion of duty was the chief\r\npreoccupation: they could not reinvigorate the empire, nor the empire\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic of the empire, not less significant than those\r\nmentioned above, was this: taken as a whole, it was _non-industrial_.\r\nManufactures existed here and there, and products of various kinds were\r\nexchanged between various parts of the empire. So far as the ordinary\r\npopulation was concerned, the Roman world might well have supplied its\r\nown needs. But this was not enough. The armies, though perilously small\r\nfor the work they had to do, were a heavy burden. The imperial civil\r\nservice as it became more elaborate did not become less costly. The waste\r\nof resources on unremunerative buildings and shows in cities, above all\r\nin Rome, and the ceaseless expense of feeding a worthless rabble, were\r\na serious drain: ordained by established custom, maintained by vanity,\r\nto economize on these follies would seem a confession of weakness. Nor\r\nshould the extravagance of the rich, and of many emperors, be forgotten:\r\nthis created a demand for luxuries chiefly imported from the East;\r\nprecious stones, delicate fabrics, spices, perfumes, rare woods, ivory,\r\nand so forth. Rome had no goods to export in payment for such things, and\r\nthe scarcity of return-cargoes must have added heavily to the cost of\r\ncarriage. There was on this account a steady drain of specie to the East,\r\nand this had to be met by a corresponding drain of specie to Rome. In one\r\nform or another this meant money drawn from the Provinces, for which the\r\nProvinces received hardly the bare pretence of an equivalent, or a better\r\nsecurity for peace.\r\n\r\nThus the empire, created by conquest and absorption, administered by\r\nbureaucratic centralization, _rested on force_; a force partly real and\r\nstill present, partly traditional, derived from a victorious past. The\r\nbelief in Rome as the eternal city went for much, and we hear of no\r\nmisgivings as to the soundness of a civilization which expressed itself\r\nin a constant excess of consumption over production. Naturally enough,\r\nunder such conditions, the imperial system became more and more what\r\nit really was from the first, a vast machine. It was not a league of\r\ncooperating units, each containing a vital principle of growth, and\r\nfurnishing the power of recovery from disaster. Its apathetic parts\r\nlooked passively to the centre for guidance or relief, depending on the\r\nperfection of a government whose imperfection was assured by attempting\r\na task beyond the reach of human faculty and virtue. The exposure of\r\nthe empire’s weakness came about through collision with the forces of\r\nnorthern barbarism. What a machine could do, that it did, and its final\r\nfailure was due to maladies that made vain all efforts to renew its\r\ninternal strength.\r\n\r\nThe wars with the northern barbarians brought out with singular clearness\r\ntwo important facts, already known but not sufficiently taken into\r\naccount. First, that the enemy were increasing in numbers while the\r\npeople of the empire were in most parts stationary or even declining.\r\nBloody victories, when gained, did practically nothing to redress the\r\nbalance. Secondly, that at the back of this embarrassing situation lay\r\na food-question of extreme seriousness and complexity. More and more\r\nfood was needed for the armies, and the rustics of the empire, even when\r\nfitted for military service, could not be spared from the farms without\r\ndanger to the food-supply. The demands of the commissariat were probably\r\nfar greater than we might on the face of it suppose; for an advance into\r\nthe enemy’s territory did not ease matters. Little or nothing was found\r\nto eat: indeed it was the pressure of a growing population on the means\r\nof subsistence that drove the hungry German tribes to face the Roman\r\nsword in quest of abundant food and the wine and oil of the South and\r\nWest. The attempt of Marcus and others after him, to solve the problems\r\nof the moment by enlisting barbarians in Roman armies, was no permanent\r\nsolution. The aliens too had to be fed, and their pay in money could not\r\nbe deferred. Meanwhile the taxation of the empire inevitably grew, and\r\nthe productive industries had to stagger along under heavier burdens.\r\nThe progressive increase of these is sufficiently illustrated in the\r\nhistory of _indictiones_. At first an _indictio_ was no more than an\r\noccasional[1546] impost of so much corn levied by imperial proclamation\r\non landed properties in order to meet exceptional scarcity in Rome.\r\nBut it was in addition to the regular _tributum_, and was of course\r\nmost likely to occur in years when scarcity prevailed. No wonder it was\r\nalready felt onerous[1547] in the time of Trajan. Pressure on imperial\r\nresources caused it not only to become more frequent, and eventually\r\nnormal: it was extended[1548] to include other products, and became a\r\nregular burden of almost universal application, and ended by furnishing\r\na new chronological unit, the Indiction-period of 15 years.\r\n\r\nThat agriculture, already none too prosperous, suffered heavily under\r\nthis capricious impost in the second century, seems to me a fact beyond\r\nall doubt. And, not being then a general imperial tax, it fell upon those\r\nprovinces that were still flourishing producers of corn. Debasement of\r\ncurrency already lowered the value of money-taxes, and tempted emperors\r\nto extend the system of dues in kind. Under Diocletian and Galerius\r\nthings came to a head. Vast increase of taxation was called for under\r\nthe new system, and it was mainly _taxation in kind_. Already the\r\nfailure of agriculture was notorious, and attempts had been made to\r\nenforce cultivation of derelict lands. The new taxation only aggravated\r\npresent evils, and in despair of milder measures Constantine attached\r\nthe _coloni_ to the soil. Important as the legal foundation of the\r\nlater serf-colonate, this law is historically still more important as a\r\nrecognition of past failure which nothing had availed to check. He saw\r\nno way of preventing a general stampede from the farms save to forbid it\r\nas illegal, and to employ the whole machinery of the empire in enforcing\r\nthe new law. This policy was only a part of the general tendency to fix\r\neverything in a rigid framework, to make all occupations hereditary, that\r\nbecame normal in the later Empire. The Codes are a standing record of the\r\nprinciple that the remedy for failure of legislation was more legislation\r\nof the same kind. Hard-pressed emperors needed all the resources\r\nthey could muster, particularly food. They had no breathing-space to\r\ntry whether more freedom might not promote enterprise and increase\r\nproduction, even had such a policy come within their view. Hence the\r\ncramping crystallizing process went on with the certainty of fate. The\r\ngovernment, unable to develope existing industry, simply squeezed it to\r\nexhaustion.\r\n\r\nHow came it that the government was able to do this? How came it that\r\nagricultural tenants could be converted into stationary serfs without\r\ncausing a general upheaval[1549] and immediate dissolution of the\r\nempire? Mainly, I think, because the act of Constantine was no more\r\nthan a recognition _de iure_ of a condition already created _de facto_\r\nby a long course of servilizing influences. Also because it was the\r\napparent interest, not only of the imperial treasury but of the great\r\nproprietors generally, to tie down to the soil[1550] the cultivators of\r\ntheir estates. Labour was now more valuable than land. In corn-growing\r\nAfrica the importance attached to the task-work of sub-tenants was a\r\nconfession of this. And, law or no law, things had to move in one or\r\nother direction. Either the landlord and head-lessee had to win further\r\ncontrol of the tenants, or the tenants must become less dependent. Only\r\nthe former alternative was possible in the circumstances; and the full\r\nmeaning of the change that turned _de facto_ dependence into legal\r\nconstraint may be stated as a recognition of the _colonus_ as labourer\r\nrather than tenant. Whether the settlement of barbarians as domiciled\r\naliens in some Provinces under strict conditions of farm-labour had\r\nanything to do with the creation of this new semi-servile status, seems\r\nhardly to be decided on defective evidence. At all events it cannot have\r\nhindered it. And we must make full allowance for the effect of various\r\nconditions in various Provinces. If we rightly suppose that the position\r\nof _coloni_ had been growing weaker for some time before the act of\r\nConstantine, this does not imply that the process was due to the same\r\ncauses operating alike in all parts of the empire in the same degree. The\r\nevidence of the Theodosian Code shews many local differences of phenomena\r\nin the fourth and fifth centuries; and it is not credible that there was\r\na greater uniformity in the conditions of the preceding age. Laws might\r\naim at uniformity, but they could not alter facts.\r\n\r\nMy conclusion therefore is that the general character of the imperial\r\nsystem was the main cause of the later serf-colonate. However much\r\nthe degradation of free farm-tenants, or the admission of slaves to\r\ntenancies, or the settlement of barbarians under conditions of service,\r\nmay have contributed to the result, it was the mechanical nature of the\r\nsystem as a whole that gave effect to them all. After Trajan the rulers\r\nof the empire became more and more conscious that the problem before\r\nthem was one of conservation, and that extension was at an end. Hadrian\r\nsaw this, and strove to perfect the internal organization. By the time\r\nof Aurelian it was found necessary to surrender territory as a further\r\nmeasure of security. We can hardly doubt that under such conditions the\r\nmachine of internal administration operated more mechanically than ever.\r\nThen, when the reforms of Diocletian made fresh taxation necessary to\r\ndefray their cost, an agricultural crisis was produced by the turning of\r\nthe imperial screw. The hierarchy of officials justified their existence\r\nby squeezing an assured revenue out of a population unable to resist\r\nbut able to remove. There was no other source of revenue to take the\r\nplace of the land: moreover, it was agricultural produce in kind that\r\nwas required. Therefore the central bureaucracy, unchecked by any public\r\nopinion, did after its wont. In that selfish and servile world each one\r\ntook care of his own skin. Compulsion was the rule: the _coloni_ must be\r\nmade to produce food: therefore they must be bound fast to the soil, or\r\nthe empire would starve—and the officials with it.\r\n\r\n                  ADDITIONAL NOTES TO CHAPTER L.\r\n\r\n    I cannot lose this opportunity of referring to a very\r\n    interesting little book by M. Augé-Laribé, _L’évolution de la\r\n    France agricole_ [Paris 1912]. Much of it bears directly on\r\n    the labour-question, and sets forth the difficulties hindering\r\n    its solution. It is peculiarly valuable to a student of the\r\n    question in the ancient world, because it lays great stress on\r\n    the effect of causes arising from modern conditions. Causes\r\n    operating in both ancient and modern times are thereby made\r\n    more readily and clearly perceptible. Such modern influences\r\n    in particular as the vast development of transport, the\r\n    concentration of machine-industries in towns, and the constant\r\n    attraction of better and more continuous wage-earning, by which\r\n    the rustic is drawn to urban centres, are highly significant.\r\n    The difference from ancient conditions is so great in degree\r\n    that it practically almost amounts to a difference in kind. So\r\n    too in the material resources of agriculture: the development\r\n    of farm-machinery has superseded much hand-labour, while\r\n    Science has increased the possible returns from a given portion\r\n    of soil.\r\n\r\n    Most significant of all from my point of view is the author’s\r\n    insistence on the _irregularity_ of wage-earning in rustic\r\n    life as an active cause of the flitting of wage-earners to the\r\n    towns. This brings it home to a student that a system of rustic\r\n    slavery implies a set of conditions incompatible with such an\r\n    economic migration; and also that the employment of slaves by\r\n    urban craftsmen would not leave many eligible openings for\r\n    immigrant rustics. It is fully consistent with my view that the\r\n    wage-earning rustic was a rare figure in the Greco-Roman world.\r\n\r\n    It is perhaps in the remedies proposed by the author for\r\n    present evils (and for the resulting depopulation of the\r\n    countryside) that the contrast of ancient and modern is\r\n    most clearly marked. Bureaucratic the French administrative\r\n    system may be: but it is not the expression of a despotism\r\n    that enslaves its citizens in the frantic effort to maintain\r\n    itself against pressure from without. For individuals and\r\n    organizations are free to think speak and act, and so to\r\n    promote what seems likely to do good. Initiative and invention\r\n    are not deadened by the fear that betterment will only serve as\r\n    a pretext for increase of burdens. Stationary by instinct the\r\n    French peasant proprietor may be: but he is free to move if he\r\n    will, and no one dare propose to tie him to the soil by law.\r\n\r\n    Nor can I omit a reference to a paper of the late Prof Pelham\r\n    on _The Imperial domains and the Colonate_ (1890, in volume of\r\n    Essays, Oxford 1911).\r\n\r\n    The simplicity of the solution there offered is most\r\n    attractive, and the general value of the treatise great. But\r\n    I do not think it a final solution of the problem. Not only\r\n    are there variations of detail in the domains known to us from\r\n    the African inscriptions (some of them found since 1890). That\r\n    some of the regulations may have been taken over from those\r\n    of former private owners is a point not considered. And there\r\n    is no mention of the notable requisition of the services of\r\n    _coloni_ as mere retainers, to which Caesar refers without\r\n    comment (above pp 183, 254). Therefore, while I welcome the\r\n    proposition that the system of the Imperial domains had much to\r\n    do with the creation of the later Colonate, I still think that\r\n    earlier and more deep-seated causes cannot safely be ignored.\r\n    Perhaps this is partly because I am looking at the matter from\r\n    a labour point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM DIOCLETIAN\r\n\r\n\r\nLI. GENERAL INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nIf we desire to treat History as the study of causation in the affairs of\r\nmankind—and this is its most fruitful task—we shall find no more striking\r\nillustration of its difficulties than the agricultural system of the\r\nlater Roman Empire. In the new model of Diocletian and Constantine we see\r\nthe imperial administration reorganized in new forms[1551] deliberately\r\nadopted: policy expresses itself, after a century of disturbance, in a\r\nclear breach with the past. But, when Constantine in 332 legislates[1552]\r\nto prevent _coloni_ from migrating, he refers to a class of men who are\r\nnot their own masters but subject to control (_iuris alieni_), though\r\nhe distinguishes them from slaves. Evidently he is not creating a new\r\nclass: his intention is to prevent an existing class from evading its\r\npresent responsibilities. They are by the fact of their birth attached\r\nas cultivators to their native soil. With this tie of _origo_[1553] goes\r\nliability to a certain proportion of imperial tax (_capitatio_). This\r\nis mentioned as a matter of course. Now we know that such serf-_coloni_\r\nformed at least a large part of the rustic population under the later\r\nEmpire. We cannot but see that the loss of the power of free migration is\r\nthe vital difference that marks off these tied farmers from the tenant\r\nfarmers of an earlier period, the class whom Columella advised landlords\r\nto retain if possible. For these men cannot move on if they would. How\r\ncame they to be in this strange condition, in fact neither slave nor\r\nfree, so that Constantine had merely to crystallize relations already\r\nexisting[1554] and the institution of serf-tenancy became a regular\r\npart of the system? If we are to form any notion of the conditions of\r\nfarm labour in this period, we must form some notion of the causes that\r\nproduced the later or dependent colonate. And this is no simple matter:\r\non few subjects has the divergence of opinions been more marked than on\r\nthis. I have stated my own conclusions above, and further considerations\r\nare adduced in this chapter.\r\n\r\nOur chief source of evidence is the collection of legal acts of the\r\nChristian emperors issued by authority in the year 438, and known as the\r\n_codex Theodosianus_. It covers a period of more than a hundred years,\r\nand innumerable references to the land-questions attest the continual\r\nanxiety of the imperial government to secure adequate cultivation of\r\nevery possible acre of land. Contemporary history may suggest motives\r\nfor this nervousness. The increased expenses of the court and the\r\nadministrative system made it necessary to raise more taxes than ever for\r\nthe civil services. The armies, now mainly composed of Germans and other\r\nbarbarians, were necessary for imperial defence, but very costly to equip\r\npay and feed. Whether they were mercenaries drawing wages, or aliens\r\nsettled as Roman subjects within the empire on lands held by tenure\r\nof military service, they were either a burden on the treasury or a\r\ndoubtful element of the population that must at all costs be kept in good\r\nhumour. On a few occasions Roman victories furnished numbers of barbarian\r\nprisoners to the slave-market. These would be dispersed over various\r\ndistricts, generally at some distance from the troubled frontiers, and\r\nthe rustic slaves of whom we hear were doubtless in great part procured\r\nin this way. But that the rustic population consisted largely of actual\r\nslaves we have no reason to believe. Of estates worked on a vast scale\r\nby slave labour we hear nothing. Naturally; for the social and economic\r\nconditions favourable to that system had long passed away. Slaves were\r\nno longer plentiful, markets were no longer free. Under the Empire, the\r\npride of great landlords needed a strong mixture of caution; under a\r\ngreedy or spendthrift emperor the display of material wealth was apt to\r\nbe dangerous. In the century of confusion before Diocletian agriculture\r\nhad been much interrupted in many parts of the empire, and much land had\r\ngone out of cultivation. So serious was the situation in the later part\r\nof that period, that Aurelian[1555] imposed upon municipal senates the\r\nburden of providing for the cultivation of derelict farms.\r\n\r\nWhen a taxpayer is required to pay a fixed amount in a stable currency,\r\nhe knows his liability. So long as he can meet it, any surplus income\r\nremains in his hands, and he has a fair chance of improving his economic\r\nposition by thrift. If what the state really wants is (say) corn, it\r\ncan use its tax-revenue to purchase corn in the open market. But this\r\nassumes that the producer is free to stand out for the best price he\r\ncan get, and that he will be paid in money on the purchasing power of\r\nwhich he can rely for his own needs. This last condition had ceased to\r\nexist[1556] in the Roman empire. Not to mention earlier tamperings with\r\nthe currency, since the middle of the third century its state had been\r\ndeplorable. Things had now gone so far that the value of the fixed money\r\ntaxes seriously reduced the income derived from them: the government was\r\nliterally paid in its own coin. The policy of Diocletian was to extend an\r\nold practice of exacting payment in kind, and this became the principal\r\nmethod[1557] of imperial taxation. We must bear in mind that the supply\r\nof corn for the city of Rome, the _annona urbis_, went on as before,\r\nthough the practical importance of Rome was steadily sinking. Diocletian\r\nmade it no longer the residence of emperors, and Constantine founded\r\nanother capital in the East: but Rome was still fed by corn-tributes\r\nfrom the Provinces, chiefly from Africa and Egypt. When the New Rome on\r\nthe Bosporus was fully equipped as an imperial capital, Egypt was made\r\nliable for the corn-supply of the Constantinopolitan populace. Old Rome\r\nhad then to rely almost entirely on Africa, with occasional help from\r\nother sources. Italy itself[1558] was now reduced to the common level,\r\ncut up into provinces, and liable for furnishing supplies of food. But\r\nit was divided into two separate regions: the northern, officially named\r\n_Italia_, or _annonariae regiones_, in which a good deal of corn was\r\ngrown, had to deliver its _annona_ at Mediolanum (Milan) the new imperial\r\nheadquarters: the southern, _suburbicariae_ (or _urbicariae_) _regiones_,\r\nin which little corn was grown, sent supplies of pigs cattle wine\r\nfirewood lime etc to Rome. The northern _annona_, like that from other\r\nprovinces, helped to maintain military forces and the host of officials\r\nemployed by the government. For it soon became the practice to pay\r\nsalaries in kind. In the pitiful state of the currency this rude method\r\noffered the best guarantee for receipt of a definite value.\r\n\r\nUnhappily this exaction and distribution in kind was at best a wasteful\r\nprocess. At worst it was simply ruinous. The empire was subject\r\nto constant menace of attack, and was in dire need of the largest\r\npossible income raised on the most economical system. If the ultimate\r\nbasis of imperial strength was to be found in the food-producers, it\r\nwas all-important to give the farming classes a feeling of security\r\nsufficient to encourage industry and enterprise, and at all costs to\r\navoid reducing them to despair. Nor was the new census as designed by\r\nDiocletian on the face of it an unjust and evil institution. Taking\r\naccount of arable lands and of the persons employed in cultivating them,\r\nit aimed at creating a fixed number[1559] of agricultural units each of\r\nwhich should be liable to furnish the same amount of yearly dues in kind.\r\nBut it is obvious that to carry out this doctrinaire scheme with uniform\r\nneatness and precision was not possible. To deal fairly with agriculture\r\na minute attention to local differences and special peculiarities was\r\nnecessary, and this attention could not be given on so vast a scale.\r\nPerhaps careful observation and correction of errors might have produced\r\na reasonable degree of perfection in a long period of unbroken peace:\r\nbut no such period was at hand. The same strain that drove the imperial\r\ngovernment to the new taxation also prevented any effective control of\r\nits working.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps inevitable that the exaction of dues in kind should lead\r\nto abuses. At all events, abuses in this department were no new thing:\r\nthe sufferings of such Provinces as Sicily and Asia were notorious in the\r\ntime of the Republic. A stricter control had made the state of things\r\nmuch better in the first two centuries of the Empire. The exploitation\r\nof the Provincials was generally checked, and the imperial government\r\nwas not as yet driven by desperate financial straits to turn extortioner\r\nitself. Caracalla’s law of 212, extending the Roman franchise[1560] to\r\nall free inhabitants, was a symptom of conscious need, for it brought\r\nall estates under the Roman succession-tax. At the same time it did\r\naway with the old distinction between the ruling Roman people and the\r\nsubject nationalities: henceforth, wherever there was oppression within\r\nthe Roman world, it necessarily fell upon Roman[1561] citizens. Time had\r\nbeen when the Roman citizen, free to move into any part of the Roman\r\ndominions and to acquire property there[1562] under protection of Roman\r\nlaw, made full use of the opportunities afforded him, to the disadvantage\r\nof the subject natives. Now all alike were the helpless subjects of a\r\ngovernment that they could neither reform nor supersede; a government\r\nwhose one leading idea was to bring all institutions into fixed grooves\r\nin which they should move mechanically year after year, unsusceptible of\r\ngrowth or decay. True, the plan was absurd, and some few observers may\r\nhave detected its absurdity. But the power of challenging centralized\r\nofficialism and evoking expression of public opinion, never more than\r\nrudimentary in the Roman state, was now simply extinct. Things had come\r\nto such a pass that, speaking generally, a citizen’s choice lay between\r\ntwo alternatives. Either he must bear an active part in the system\r\nthat was squeezing out the vital economic forces of the empire, making\r\nwhenever possible a profit for himself out of a salary or illicit gains;\r\nor he must submit passively to all such extortions as the system, worked\r\nby men whose duty and interest alike tended to make them merciless, was\r\ncertain to inflict. The oppressors, though numerous, could only be few\r\nin proportion to the whole free population. Therefore the vast majority\r\nstood officially condemned to lives of penury and wretchedness. The\r\nsystem became more hard-set and the outlook more hopeless with the lapse\r\nof time.\r\n\r\nThe dues exacted from the various parts of the empire varied in\r\nquality[1563] according to local conditions, and to some extent in\r\nmethods of collection. In the frontier Provinces the quantity was\r\nsometimes reduced[1564] by remissions, when a district ravaged by\r\ninvaders was relieved for a few years that it might recover its normal\r\nproductiveness. The details of these variations are beyond the scope\r\nof the present inquiry. The general principle underlying the whole\r\nsystem was the fixing of taxation-units equal in liability, and the\r\norganizing of collection in municipal groups. Each municipal town\r\nor _civitas_ was the administrative centre of a district, and stood\r\ncharged in the imperial ledgers as liable for the returns from a\r\ncertain number of units, this number being that recorded as existing at\r\nthe last quinquennial census. For the collection the chief municipal\r\nauthorities were responsible; and they had to hand over the amount due\r\nto the imperial authorities, whether they had received it in full or\r\nnot. Already burdened with strictly municipal liabilities, the members\r\nof municipal senates (_curiales_) were crushed by this additional and\r\nincalculable pressure. Unable to resist, they generally took the course\r\nof so using their functions and powers as to protect their own interests\r\nas far as possible. One obvious precaution was to see that the number\r\nof taxable units[1565] in their district was not fixed too high by the\r\ncensus officials. This precaution was certainly not overlooked, and\r\nsuccess in keeping down the number may well have been the chief reason\r\nwhy the system was able to go on so long. The _curiales_ were mostly\r\nconsiderable landlords, residing in their town and letting their land to\r\ntenants. But there were other landlords, smaller men, some also resident\r\nin the towns, others in the country. We still hear of men farming\r\nland[1566] of their own, and it seems that some of these held and farmed\r\nother land also, as _coloni_ of larger landlords. When any question arose\r\nas to the number of units for the tax on which this or that farm was\r\nliable, it is clear that the interests of different classes might easily\r\nclash. And the _curiales_ undoubtedly took care[1567] that their own and\r\nthose of their friends did not suffer.\r\n\r\nThese remarks imply that the system practically worked in favour of the\r\nricher classes[1568] as against the poorer. And so it certainly did, not\r\nonly in the time of revision at the census each fifth year, but on other\r\noccasions. If an invasion or some other great disaster led the emperor\r\nto grant temporary relief, this would normally take the form of reducing\r\nthe number of taxable units in the district for a certain period. But\r\nthe local authorities were left to apportion this reduction[1569] among\r\nthe several estates, and the poor farmers had no representative to see\r\nthat they got their fair share of relief. Moreover, outside taxation,\r\nthe farmers were often subjected to heavy burdens and damage by the\r\nirregular requisitions of imperial officials. For instance, the staff\r\nof the imperial post-service (_cursus publicus_)[1570] were a terror.\r\nThey pressed the goods of farmers into the service of their department\r\non various pretexts, and exacted labour on upkeep of roads and stations.\r\nFor their tyranny there was no effective compensation or redress. Like\r\nother officials, they could be bought off by bribes: but this meant that\r\nthe various exactions[1571] were shifted from the shoulders of the rich\r\nto those of the poor. Another iniquity, the revival of a very old[1572]\r\nabuse, was connected with the question of transport, an important\r\nconsideration in the case of dues in kind, often bulky. For instance, in\r\nthe case of corn, the place at which it had to be delivered might easily\r\ncount for more in estimating the actual pressure of the burden than the\r\namount of grain levied. In making the arrangements for delivery there\r\nwere openings for favouritism and bribery. Circumstances varied greatly\r\nin various parts of the empire. In some Provinces delivery was made at a\r\nmilitary depot within easy reach. Transport by sea from Egypt or Africa\r\nwas carried on by gilds[1573] of shippers, who became more and more\r\norganized and regulated by law. But in many parts good roads were few,\r\nand laid out for strategic reasons; the country roads inconvenient and\r\nrough: and for transport in bulk the post-service provided no machinery\r\navailable for the use of private persons.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary here to follow out in detail all the particular\r\ndiscomforts and grievances of the farming classes under the system\r\ndevised by Diocletian and developed by his successors. Enough has\r\nbeen said to shew that they were great, and to remove all ground for\r\nwondering that the area of arable land actually under tillage, and\r\nwith it population, continued to decline. Constantine’s law confirming\r\nthe bondage of _coloni_ to the soil by forbidding movement was the\r\nconfession of a widespread evil, but no remedy. Repeated legislation\r\nto the same purpose only recorded and continued the failure. When all\r\nthe resources of evasion were exhausted, the pauperized serf fled to\r\na town and depended for a living on the pitiful doles of private or\r\necclesiastical charity, or turned brigand and took precarious toll\r\nof those who still had something to lose. In either case he was an\r\nadditional burden on a society that already had more than it could bear.\r\nIn 382 we find an attempt[1574] made to put down ‘sturdy beggars.’ The\r\nlaw rewarded anyone who procured the conviction of such persons by\r\nhanding over the offenders to him. An ex-slave became the approver’s own\r\nslave, and one who had nothing of his own beyond his freeborn quality\r\nwas granted to him as his _colonus_ for life. But this law seems to have\r\nbeen ineffectual like others. Desertion of farms might to some extent be\r\nchecked, but mendicity and brigandage remained.\r\n\r\nThere was however another movement, later in time and less in volume,\r\nbut not less serious as affecting the practical working of the imperial\r\nmachine. With the increase of poverty life in municipal towns became less\r\nattractive. Local eminence was no longer an object of ambition; for to\r\nlocal burdens, once cheerfully borne, was now added a load of imperial\r\nresponsibilities which lay heavy on all men of property, and which they\r\ncould neither shake off nor control. In hope of evading them, well-to-do\r\ncitizens took refuge[1575] in the country, either on estates of their own\r\nor under the protection of great landlords already settled there. But to\r\nallow this would mean the depletion of the local senates (_curiae_) on\r\nwhose services as revenue-collectors the financial system of the empire\r\ndepended. To prevent men qualified for the position of _curiales_ from\r\nescaping that duty was the aim of legislation[1576] which by repeated\r\nenactments confessed its own failure. That there were country magnates,\r\nmen of influence (_potentes_), whose protection might seem able to\r\nscreen municipal defaulters, is a point to be noted. They were the great\r\n_possessores_[1577] (a term no longer applied to small men), who held\r\nlarge estates organized on a sort of manorial model, and sometimes ruled\r\nthem like little principalities, territorial lordships[1578] standing\r\nin direct relations with the central authorities and not hampered\r\nby inclusion in the general municipal scheme. Such ‘peculiars’ had\r\nexisted under the earlier Empire, and evidently continued to exist: the\r\nCrown-lands of the emperors, especially in Africa, were the most signal\r\ncases. But the great private Possessor could not secure to his domain\r\nthe various exemptions[1579] that emperors conferred on theirs. He had\r\nto collect and pay over[1580] the dues from his estate, as a municipal\r\nmagistrate did from the district round his town-centre. But he had a more\r\nimmediate and personal interest in the wellbeing of all his tenants and\r\ndependants, whose presence and prosperity gave to his land by far the\r\ngreater part[1581] of its value.\r\n\r\nThat territorial magnates should be free to build up a perhaps dangerous\r\npower in various corners of the empire by gathering dependants round\r\nthem, could hardly be viewed with approval by the jealousy of emperors.\r\nNot only was the system of letting land in parcels to tenants spreading,\r\nbut the power of the landlords over them was increasing, long before\r\nConstantine took the final step of treating them as attached permanently\r\nto the soil. Whether they were the landlord’s free tenants who had\r\ngradually lost through economic weakness the effective use of freedom;\r\nor small freeholders who had found it worth their while to part with\r\ntheir holdings to a big man and become his tenants for the sake of\r\nenjoying his protection; or former slaves to whom small farms had been\r\nentrusted on various conditions; they were in a sort of economic bondage.\r\nDoubtless most of them lived from hand to mouth, but we have no reason\r\nto believe that poverty, so long as they had plenty to live on, was the\r\nmotive[1582] that made them wish to give up their holdings and try their\r\nluck elsewhere. It was the cruel pressure of Diocletian’s new taxation,\r\nand the army of officials employed to enforce it, that drove them to\r\ndespair. A contemporary witness[1583] tells us, referring to this very\r\nmatter, ‘the excess of receivers over givers was becoming so marked\r\nthat farms were being abandoned, and tillages falling to woodland, the\r\nresources of the tenants being exhausted by the hugeness[1584] of the\r\nimposts.’ And this evidence does not stand alone. So Constantine sought a\r\nremedy in prevention of movement, binding down the tenants to the soil.\r\nHenceforth the land to which a _colonus_[1585] was attached by birth, and\r\nthe _colonus_ himself, were to be legally and economically inseparable.\r\nAttempts at evading the new rule were persistently met by later[1586]\r\nlegislation. The motive of such attempts may be found by remembering\r\nthat depopulation was steadily lowering the value of land and raising\r\nthat of labour. If an individual landlord could add to the value of his\r\nown estate by getting more _coloni_ settled on it, withdrawn from other\r\nestates, he might profit by the transaction: but the government, whose\r\npolicy was to keep the greatest possible area under cultivation, could\r\nnot allow one part to be denuded of labourers to suit the interest of the\r\nowner of another part.\r\n\r\nWhen the law stepped in to deprive the tenant, already far gone in\r\ndependence on his landlord, of such freedom of movement as he still\r\nretained, it is remarkable that rustic slaves were not at the same time\r\nlegally attached to the soil. That inconvenience was caused by masters\r\nselling them when and where they chose, is shewn by Constantine’s\r\nlaw[1587] of 327, allowing such sales to take place only within the\r\nlimits of the Province where they had been employed. No doubt their\r\nremoval upset the arrangements for that part of a taxable unit in\r\nwhich the number of adult heads[1588] was taken into account, and\r\nso had to be checked. But it seems not to have been till the time\r\nof Valentinian[1589], somewhere between 367 and 375, that the sale\r\nof a farm-slave off the land was directly prohibited, like that of\r\na _colonus_. In referring to this matter, the significance of the\r\ndifference of dates is thus brought out[1590] by Seeck: ‘That this\r\nmeasure was carried through much sooner in the case of the small farmers\r\nthan in that of the farm-slaves, is very characteristic of the spirit\r\nof that age. Where court favour is the deciding factor that governs\r\nthe entire policy, the government is even more reluctant to limit the\r\nproprietary rights of the great landlord[1591] than the liberties of\r\nthe small man.’ This is very true, but we must not forget that in both\r\ncases the binding of the labourer to the soil did in fact restrict the\r\nlandlord’s freedom of disposal. He as well as his dependants came under\r\na system not designed to promote his private convenience or interest,\r\nbut to guarantee a maximum of total cultivation in the interest of the\r\nempire as a whole. So we find that he was not allowed[1592] to raise at\r\nwill the rents of his tenants: they could sue their landlord (a right\r\nwhich in practice was probably not worth much), and even when this right\r\nwas restricted[1593] in 396 they still retained it in respect of unfair\r\nincreases of rent and criminal cases. So too, if he acquired extra\r\nslaves, either by receiving them as volunteers from derelict farms or\r\nin virtue of an imperial grant, it was strictly ordained[1594] that\r\nsuch acquisition carried with it the tax-liability for the whole of the\r\nderelict land. The landlord was therefore kept firmly in the grip of\r\nthe central power, and not left free to build up a little principality\r\nby consolidating at will all the labour-resources that he could annex\r\nas dependants. Moreover he was watched by a host of imperial agents and\r\nspies whose interests could only be reconciled with his own by the costly\r\nmethod of recurrent bribery.\r\n\r\nWhen we return to the main question of the actual farm-labour, and ask\r\nwho toiled with their own hands to raise crops, we find ourselves in a\r\ncurious position. The evidence, whether legal or literary, leaves us\r\nin no doubt that the tenant farmer of this period was normally himself\r\na labourer. And yet it is not easy to cite passages in which this is\r\ndirectly affirmed. The pompous and affected language of the imperial\r\nlaws is throughout a bad medium for conveying simple facts; nor was the\r\nquestion, who did the work, of any interest to the central authority,\r\nconcerned solely with the regular exaction of the apportioned dues. The\r\nreal proof that _coloni_, whether still holding some land of their own\r\nor merely tenants, and _inquilini_, whether solely barbarian dependants\r\nor not, were actual handworkers, is to be found in legitimate inference\r\nfrom certain facts. First, the increase in the value of labour compared\r\nwith the decline in that of land. The binding of tenant to soil was a\r\nconfession of this. Secondly, the general poverty of the farmers[1595]\r\nand their helplessness against oppression and wrong. Of this the\r\ndescription of Salvian gives a striking, if rhetorical, picture, and it\r\nis implied in many laws designed[1596] for their protection. That persons\r\nin so weak an economic position could have carried on their business\r\nas mere directors of slave-labour is surely inconceivable: and we are\r\nto remember that not only they themselves but their families also were\r\nbound to the soil. It was their presence, that is to say their labour,\r\nthat gave value to the land, and so paid the taxes. Hence it was that in\r\nforming taxable units (_capita_) it was generally the practice to include\r\nin the reckoning[1597] not only the productive area (_iugatio_) but also\r\nthe ‘heads’ that stocked it (_capitatio_). In other words, productiveness\r\nmust in the interest of the state be actual, not merely potential.\r\n\r\nThe importance of keeping the real locally-bound _coloni_ strictly to\r\ntheir business of food-production was fully recognized in the regulations\r\nfor recruiting the armies. Landlords, required to furnish[1598] recruits,\r\nwere free to name some of their _coloni_ for that purpose. But there\r\nwas no fear that they would be eager to do this, for the work of their\r\ntenants was what gave value to their properties. And the imperial\r\nofficers charged with recruiting duty were ordered[1599] (and this in\r\n400, when the need of soldiers was extreme) not to accept fugitive\r\ntenants belonging to an estate (_indigenis_): these no doubt if found\r\nwere to be returned to their lords. The military levy was to fall upon\r\nsons of veterans, for in this class as in others no effort was spared\r\nto make the ways of life hereditary; or on wastrels (_vagos_)[1600], of\r\nwhom the laws often make mention; or generally on persons manifestly\r\nby the circumstances of their birth (_origo_) liable to army service.\r\nHere we have the service still in principle confined to freemen. But\r\nit is not to be doubted that many a slave (and these would be nearly\r\nall rustic slaves) passed muster with officers hasting to make up their\r\ntale of men, and so entered the army. At a much later date (529) we find\r\nJustinian[1601] contemplating cases of slaves recruited with the consent\r\nof their owners, in short furnished as recruits. He enacts that such men\r\nare to be declared _ingenui_[1602], that is freeborn not freedmen, the\r\nmaster losing all rights over them: but, if they are efficient soldiers,\r\nthey are to remain in the service. And the power of commuting[1603]\r\nthe obligation of furnishing a recruit for a payment of money, which\r\nwas to some extent allowed, introduced a method of recruiting[1604] by\r\npurchase. A recruit being demanded, it did not follow that the emperor\r\ngot either the particular man (inspected of course and passed as fit) or\r\na fixed cash-commutation. The recruiting officer conveniently happened\r\nto have a man or two at disposal, picked up in the course of his tour.\r\nThe landlord, anxious to keep his own staff intact, came to terms with\r\nthe officer for one of these as substitute. These officers knew when\r\nthey could drive hard bargains, and did not lose their chances. In a\r\nlaw of 375, this system is directly referred to, and an attempt is made\r\nto regulate it[1605] on an equitable footing. To abolish it was clearly\r\nimpossible. Eventually the state undertook to work it officially, and\r\nbought its own ‘bodies’ (_corpora_, like σώματα, of slaves) with the\r\ncomposition-money or _aurum_ _temonarium_. That some of these ‘bodies’\r\nwere escaped slaves is highly probable. Some may have been stray\r\nbarbarians, not included in the various barbarian corps which more and\r\nmore came to form the backbone of the Roman army. But the majority would\r\nprobably be indigent wretches to whom any change seemed better than the\r\nmiserable lives open to them in the meanest functions of the decaying\r\ncivilization of the towns. In any case such recruits[1606] would be but a\r\npoor substitute for the pick of the rustic population.\r\n\r\nThe same anxiety to spare the rustics unnecessary exactions, that\r\nthey might not sink under their present burdens, appears in other\r\nregulations. The subordinates employed in the public services such as\r\nthe Post, or as attendants on functionaries, were tempted to ease their\r\nown duties by demanding contributions from the helpless countryfolk.\r\nThis we find forbidden[1607] in 321 as interfering with the farmers’\r\nright to procure and carry home things required for agriculture. So\r\ntoo a whole Title[1608] in the _Codex_ is devoted to the prevention of\r\n_superexactiones_, a form of extortion often practised by officials,\r\nchiefly by the use of false weights and measures or by foul play with the\r\nofficial receipts. The laws forbidding practices of this kind seem to\r\nbelong to the latter part of the fourth century and the earlier part of\r\nthe fifth. But the evil was clearly of old standing, and the laws almost\r\ncertainly vain. That illicit exactions were a particular affliction of\r\nthe poorer rustics, who could not bribe the officials, is confessed[1609]\r\nby a law of 362, which ordains that the burdens of supplying beasts\r\nfodder etc for service of the Post, upkeep of the roads and so forth,\r\nare to be laid on all _possessores_ alike. Further enactments follow in\r\n401 and 408. But these rules for equitable distribution of burdens, even\r\nif carried out, only spread them over all landowners and _coloni_. All\r\nthe upper ranks[1610] of the imperial service carried exemption from\r\n_sordida munera_ in some form or other, and personal grants of exemption\r\nwere often granted as a favour. It is true that such exemption only\r\nextended to the life of the grantee, that exemptions were revocable, and\r\nthat in course of time extreme necessities led to revocations. But all\r\nthis did not operate to relieve the unhappy rustic on whom the whole\r\nimperial fabric rested. The rich might have to lose their privileges, but\r\nit was too late for the poor to gain a benefit. That the underlings of\r\nprovincial governors were a terror to farmers, levying on them illicit\r\nservices and generally blackmailing them for their own profit, is clear\r\nfrom the law[1611] (somewhere 368-373) announcing severe punishment for\r\nthe offence and declaring that it had become a regular practice. The law\r\nof 328, enacting[1612] that no farmer (_agricola_) was to be impressed\r\nfor special service in the seasons of seed-time or harvest, is on rather\r\na different footing. It expressly justifies the prohibition on the ground\r\nof agricultural necessity: in short, it is not to protect the farmer,\r\nbut, to leave him no excuse for not producing food.\r\n\r\nA great critic[1613] has commented severely on the intellectual\r\nstagnation that fell upon the Roman empire and was one of the most\r\neffective causes of its decline. That literature fed upon the past and\r\ndwindled into general imbecility is commonly recognized: but the lack\r\nof material inventions and the paucity of improvements is perhaps not\r\nless significant than the decay of literature and art. The department of\r\nagriculture was no exception to this sterile traditionality. Since the\r\ndays of Varro there had been no considerable change. So far as labour is\r\nconcerned, the system of Columella can hardly be called an advance; for\r\nit employs directly none but slave labour, a resource already beginning\r\nto fail, and causing landlords to seek help from the development of\r\ntenancies. In modern times the dearness of labour has stimulated human\r\ningenuity to produce machines by which the efficiency of human labour\r\nis increased and therefore fewer hands required for a given output. But\r\nin the world under the Roman supremacy centuries went by with hardly\r\nany modification of the mechanical equipment. A small exception may\r\nperhaps be found in a sort of rudimentary reaping-machine. It was briefly\r\nreferred to by the elder Pliny[1614] in the first century of our era,\r\nand described by Palladius in the fourth. The device was in use on\r\nthe large estates in the lowlands of Gaul, and was perhaps a Gaulish\r\ninvention. It is said to have been a labour-saving[1615] appliance. From\r\nthe description it seems to have been clumsy; and, since it cut off the\r\nears and left the straw standing, it was only suited to farms on which\r\nno special use was made of the straw. Its structure (for it was driven\r\nby an ox from behind) must have made it unworkable on sloping ground.\r\nThat we hear nothing of its general adoption may be due to these or\r\nother defects. But I believe there is no record of attempts to improve\r\nthe original design. The lack of interest in improvement of tools has\r\nbeen noted as a phenomenon accompanying the dependence on slave labour.\r\nAnd when under the Roman empire we see the free tenant passing into the\r\ncondition of a serf-tenant, we are witnessing a process that steadily\r\ntended to reduce him to the moral labour-level of the apathetic and\r\nhopeless slave. To make the agriculture of a district more prosperous\r\nwas to attract the attention of greedy officials. To resist their illicit\r\nextortions was to attract the attention of the central government, whose\r\ngrowing needs were ever tempting it to squeeze more and more out of its\r\nsubjects. Why then should the rustic, tied to the soil, trouble himself\r\nto seek more economical methods, the profits of which, if ever realized,\r\nhe was not himself likely to enjoy?\r\n\r\n\r\nLII. LIBANIUS.\r\n\r\nIn order to get so far as possible a living picture of the conditions of\r\nrustic life and labour we must glean the scattered notices preserved to\r\nus in the writers of the period of decline. Due allowance must be made\r\nfor the general artificiality and rhetorical bent of authors trained in\r\nthe still fashionable schools of composition and style. For even private\r\nletters were commonly written as models destined eventually to be read\r\nand admired by the public, while in controversial works and public\r\naddresses the tendency to attitudinize was dominant. The circulation\r\nof literary trivialities and exchange of cheap compliments, especially\r\nprevalent in Gaul, was kept up to the last by self-satisfied cliques\r\nwhen the barbarians were already established in the heart of the empire.\r\nNevertheless valuable sidelights on questions of fact are thrown from\r\nseveral points of view. This evidence agrees with that drawn from the\r\nimperial laws, and is in so far better for our purpose that it deals\r\nalmost exclusively with the present. When it looks to the future, it is\r\nin the form of petition or advice; while the normal substance of the laws\r\nis to confess the existence of monstrous abuses by threatening offenders\r\nwith penalties ever more and more severe, and enjoining reforms that no\r\npenalties could enforce. A writer very characteristic of his age (about\r\n315-400) is the ‘sophist’ =Libanius=, who passed most of his later years\r\nat Antioch, the luxurious chief city of the East. For matters under his\r\nimmediate observation he is a good authority, and may help us to form\r\na notion of the extent to which imperial ordinances were practically\r\noperative in the eastern parts of the empire.\r\n\r\nTwo of the ‘orations,’ or written addresses, of Libanius are particularly\r\ninteresting as appeals to the emperor Theodosius for redress of\r\nmalpractices affecting the rustic population and impairing the financial\r\nresources of the empire. The earlier[1616] (about 385) exposes gross\r\nmisdeeds of the city magistrates of Antioch. What with the falling of\r\nold houses and clearing of sites for new buildings there were great\r\nquantities of mixed rubbish to be removed and deposited elsewhere.\r\nApparently there was now no sufficient staff of public slaves at\r\ndisposal; at all events the city authorities resorted to illegal means\r\nfor procuring the removal. When the country folk came into town to\r\ndispose of their produce, the magistrates requisitioned their carts asses\r\nmules (and themselves as drivers) for this work. Thus the time of the\r\npoor rustics was wasted, their carts and sacks damaged, and they and\r\ntheir beasts sent back to their homes in a state of utter exhaustion.\r\nNo law empowered the city magnates to act thus. From small beginnings a\r\nsort of usage had been created, which nothing short of imperial ordinance\r\ncould now break and abolish. That the magistrates were conscious of doing\r\nwrong was shewn by what they avoided doing. They did not impress slaves\r\nor carts from houses in the city. They did not exact like services from\r\nthe military or powerful landlords. Nor did they lay the burden on the\r\nestates[1617] of the municipality, the rents from which were part of\r\nthe revenues of Antioch. Favour is only justified by equity; and there\r\nis, says Libanius, no equity in sparing the luxurious rich by ruining\r\nthe poor. So he entreats his most gracious[1618] Majesty to protect the\r\nfarms as much as the cities, or rather more. For the country is in fact\r\nthe foundation on which cities rest. Without it they could never have\r\nexisted: and now it is on the rise and fall of rural wellbeing that urban\r\nprosperity depends. This appeal speaks for itself. But it is significant\r\nthat the skilled pleader thinks it wise to end on a note of imperial\r\ninterest. ‘Moreover, Sire, it is from the country that your tribute\r\nis drawn. It is to the cities that you address your orders[1619] for\r\ntaxation, but the cities have to raise it from the country. Therefore, to\r\nprotect the farmers is to preserve your interests, and to maltreat the\r\nfarmers is to betray them.’\r\n\r\nIn the oration numbered 47 the abuse dealt with is of a very different\r\nkind. The date is 391 or 392, and the subject is the ‘protections’\r\n(_patrocinia_)[1620] of villages. The pressure of imperial taxation\r\nand the abuses accompanying its collection had driven the villagers\r\nto seek help in resisting the visits of the tax-gatherers. This help\r\nwas generally found in placing the village under the protection of\r\nsome powerful person, commonly a retired soldier, who acted as a\r\nrallying-centre and leader, probably in most cases backed by some\r\nretainers of his own class. Of course these men did not undertake\r\nopposition to the public authorities for nothing. But it seems that\r\ntheir exactions were, at least in the earlier stages, found to be less\r\nburdensome than those of the official collectors. The situation thus\r\ncreated was as follows. The local senators (_curiales_) whose turn it\r\nwas to collect the dues from the district under their municipality (a\r\nduty that they were not allowed to shirk) went out to the villages for\r\nthe purpose. They were beaten off[1621] by use of force, often wounded\r\nas well as foiled. They were still bound to pay over the tax, which they\r\nhad not received, to the imperial treasury. In these latter days default\r\nof payment rendered them liable to cruel scourging. So the unhappy\r\n_curiales_ had to sell their own property to make up the amount due.\r\nThe loss of their means strikes them out of the _curia_ for lack of the\r\nlegal qualification. And this was not only a loss to their particular\r\ncity: it damaged imperial interests, bound up as the whole system was\r\nwith maintaining unimpaired the supply of qualified _curiales_. The evil\r\nof these ‘protections’ was, according to Libanius, great and widespread.\r\nThe protectors had become a great curse to the villagers themselves by\r\ntheir tyranny and exactions. Their lawless sway had turned[1622] farmers\r\ninto brigands, and taught them to use iron not for tools of tillage but\r\nfor weapons of bloodshed. And the trouble was not confined to villages\r\nwhere the land belonged to a number of small owners: it extended also to\r\nthose[1623] under one big proprietor. The argument that the villagers\r\nhave a right to seek help in resistance to extortion, is only sound if\r\nthe means employed are fair. To justify this limitation two significant\r\nanalogies[1624] are applied. Cities near the imperial frontier must not\r\ncall in the foreign enemy to aid them in settling their differences with\r\neach other: they must seek help within the empire. A slave must not\r\ninvoke the aid of casual bystanders against ill-usage: he stands in no\r\nrelation to outsiders, and must look to his master for redress. The full\r\nbearing of these considerations is seen when we remember that the farmers\r\nare serf-tenants. They are owned[1625] by masters, as the municipal city\r\nexists only in and for the empire, and the slave has no legal personality\r\napart from his lord.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact, says[1626] Libanius, that through such evasion of their\r\nliabilities on the part of the rustics many houses have been ruined. He\r\nis surely referring to the _curiales_ and other landlords resident in the\r\ncity, the numbers of which class it was the imperial policy to maintain\r\nat full strength. In moral indignation[1627] he urges the iniquity of\r\nbeggaring poor souls who have nothing to live on but the income from\r\ntheir lands. ‘Say I have an estate, inherited or bought, farmed by\r\nsensible tenants who humbly faced the ups and downs of Fortune under\r\nmy considerate care. Must you then stir them up by agitation, arousing\r\nunlooked-for conflicts, and reducing men of good family to indigence?’\r\nThis appeal would not sound overdrawn in the society of that age, though\r\nit might fall somewhat coldly upon modern ears. But the most notable\r\npoint in this oration is the nature of the remedy[1628] for which the\r\nwriter pleads, and which none but the emperor can supply. It is simply to\r\nenforce the existing law. Some years before, probably in 368, the emperor\r\nValens had strictly forbidden[1629] the ‘protections’ that were the cause\r\nof this trouble. So now the appeal to Theodosius is ‘give the law sinews,\r\nmake it a law indeed[1630] and not a bare exhortation.’ For, if it is not\r\nto be observed, it had better be repealed. That a leading writer of the\r\nday could so state the case to the ruler of the Roman world is a fact to\r\nbe borne in mind by readers of the imperial laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIII. SYMMACHUS\r\n\r\nIn passing on to =Q. Aurelius Symmachus=[1631] (about 345-405) we find\r\nourselves in very different surroundings. The scene is in Italy, and\r\nthe author a man of the highest station in what was still regarded as\r\nthe true centre of the Roman world. He was _praefectus urbi_ in 384-5,\r\nconsul in 391, and the leading figure in Roman society and literary\r\ncircles. From the bulky collection of his letters, and the forty reports\r\n(_relationes_) addressed to the emperor by him as city prefect, we get\r\nmuch interesting evidence as to the condition of rural Italy and the\r\nanxieties of the corn-supply of Rome. With his championship of the old\r\nreligion, by which he is best known, we have here nothing to do; and\r\nhis literary affectations, characteristic of most writers of the later\r\nEmpire, do not discredit him as a witness. A remarkable feature of his\r\nletters is their general triviality and absence of direct reference to\r\nthe momentous events that were happening in many parts of the empire.\r\nHis attention is almost wholly absorbed by matters with which he was\r\nimmediately connected, his public duties, his private affairs, the\r\ninterests of his relatives and friends, or the exchange of compliments.\r\nHis time is mostly passed either in Rome or at one or other of his\r\nnumerous country seats: for he was one of the great landlords of his\r\nday, and the condition of Italian agriculture was of great importance to\r\nhim. As a representative of the landed interest and as a self-conscious\r\nletter-writer he resembles the younger Pliny, but is weaker and set in a\r\nless happy age.\r\n\r\nA topic constantly recurring[1632] in his correspondence is the\r\napprehension of famine in Rome and the disturbances certain to arise\r\ntherefrom. The distribution of imperial powers among several seats of\r\ngovernment (of which Rome was not one) since the changes of Diocletian\r\nhad left to the ancient capital only a sort of traditional primacy. The\r\ncentral bureaus were elsewhere, and Rome was only the effective capital\r\nof the southern division of Italy. Yet the moral force of her great past\r\nwas still a living influence that expressed itself in various ways,\r\nnotably in the growth of the Papacy out of the Roman bishopric. For\r\ncenturies it had been the licensed lodging of a pauperized mob, fed by\r\ndoles to keep them quiet, enjoying luxurious baths at nominal cost, and\r\nentertained with exciting or bloody shows in the circus or amphitheatre.\r\nThis rabble had either to be kept alive and amused or got rid of; but the\r\nlatter alternative would surely have reduced Rome to the condition of a\r\ndead city. It was morally impossible for a Roman emperor to initiate so\r\nominous a policy. So the wasteful abomination dragged on, and every hitch\r\nin the corn-supply alarmed not only the _praefectus annonae_ but the\r\n_praefectus urbi_ with the prospect of bread riots. And the assignment\r\nof the Egyptian corn to supply Constantinople made Rome more than ever\r\ndependent on the fortunes of the African[1633] harvest. When this failed,\r\nit was only by great departmental energy that temporary shortage was\r\nmade good by importations[1634] from Macedonia Sardinia or Spain or even\r\nby some surplus from Egypt. Even lower Italy, where little corn was\r\ngrown, was at a pinch made to yield some. But bad seasons were not the\r\nonly cause of short supplies. The acts of enemies might starve out Rome,\r\nas the rebellion of Gildo in Africa (397-8) nearly did. Moreover the\r\nslackness and greed of officials[1635] sometimes ruined the efficiency of\r\nthe department, and ‘profiteering’ was practised by unscrupulous[1636]\r\ncapitalists. Nor even with good harvests abroad were the prefects\r\nalways at ease, since the corn-fleets might be delayed or scattered\r\nby foul weather, and meanwhile the consumption did not cease. And it\r\nsometimes happened that the cargoes were damaged and the public health\r\nsuffered[1637] from unwholesome food. Among these various cares the\r\n_praefectura annonae_ was no bed of roses. No wonder the worthy Symmachus\r\ntells us of private charity[1638] to relieve the necessities of the poor,\r\nand even gives a hint of voluntary rationing at the tables of the rich.\r\nBut in appealing to the gods for succour he rather suggests that human\r\nbenevolence would be unequal to the strain.\r\n\r\nThat agriculture was not on a sound footing in most of Italy is evident\r\nfrom several passages in the letters. In one of the earliest (before\r\n376) he tells his father that, though he finds Campania charming, he\r\nshould like to join him at Praeneste. ‘But’ he adds ‘I am in trouble\r\nabout my property. I must go and inspect it wherever it lies, not in\r\nhope of making it remunerative, but in order to realize the promise\r\nof the land by further outlay. For things are nowadays come to such a\r\npass[1639] that an owner has to feed the farm that once fed him.’ Some\r\nof the references to the management of estates are rather obscure. In\r\nspeaking of one near Tibur he mentions[1640] stewards (_vilicorum_)\r\nand complains of their neglect. ‘The land is badly farmed, and great\r\npart of the returns (_fructuum_) is in arrear (_debetur_): the _coloni_\r\nhave no means left[1641] to enable them to clear their accounts or to\r\ncarry on cultivation.’ The exact status of these stewards and tenants\r\nand their relations to each other are far from clear, and the case may\r\nhave been a peculiar one. Again, writing to bespeak the good offices of\r\nan influential man on behalf of an applicant, he says ‘I do this for\r\nhim rather as a duty[1642] than as an act of free grace, for he is a\r\nfarm-tenant of mine.’ The tenant’s name is Theodulus, which invites a\r\nconjecture that this was a case of an oriental Greek slave placed as\r\ntenant on a farm, either for his master’s account, or for his own at\r\na rent, and afterwards manumitted. A reference to _servi_, dependants\r\n(_obnoxii_)[1643] who are owing him rents which his agents on the distant\r\nestate in question do not take the trouble to collect, may point to the\r\nsame sort of arrangement. In another passage he mentions[1644] a man who\r\nwas for a long time _colonus_ under a certain landlord, but here too the\r\nlack of detail forbids inference as to the exact nature of the relation.\r\nThat slave labour was still employed on some Italian farms appears from\r\na request[1645] for help in recovering some runaways. They may have been\r\nhouse slaves, but if a neighbouring landlord gave them shelter no doubt\r\nhe made them pay for it in work. The control of slaves in the country\r\nwas never easy, and the quasi-military discipline described by Columella\r\nwas a confession of this. And it was only on a large scale that a staff\r\nof overseers sufficient to work it could be provided. The time for it\r\nwas indeed gone by. Slaves employed in hunting[1646] are mentioned by\r\nSymmachus as by Pliny. No doubt they took to this occupation with zest.\r\nThe degeneracy of hunting by deputy is contemptuously noted as a sign of\r\nthe times by the soldier critic[1647] Ammianus. But it was no new thing.\r\n\r\nThat the general state of the countryside was hardly favourable to the\r\nquiet development of agriculture may be gathered from many notices. For\r\ninstance, when he would have been glad to be out of Rome for the good of\r\nhis health, he complains[1648] that the prevalence of brigandage in the\r\ncountry near forces him to stay in the city. A friend urges him to come\r\nback to Rome for fear of a violent raid on an estate apparently suburban:\r\nhe can only reply[1649] that a breach of possession during his absence\r\nwill not hold good in law. Whether the _militaris impressio_[1650] on\r\nhis farm at Ostia, to which he casually refers, was the raid of foreign\r\nfoes suddenly landing on that coast, or the lawless outrage of imperial\r\ntroops, is not certain: I rather suspect the latter. For, fifteen years\r\nlater (398), after the overthrow of Gildo, he writes[1651] that the\r\nsoldiers are all back from Africa, and the Appian way is clear: here the\r\nmeaning seems plain. And his endeavour[1652] to prevent the commandeering\r\nof an old friend’s house at Ariminum for military quarters is significant\r\nof the high-handed treatment of civilians by army men in those days, of\r\nwhich we have other evidence. Nevertheless men were still willing to buy\r\nestates. Symmachus himself was still adding to his vast possessions.\r\nWe see him in treaty[1653] for a place in Samnium, where there was\r\napparently some queer practice on the part of the seller: in another case\r\nhe is annoyed[1654] that his partner in a joint purchase has contrived\r\nto secure the whole bargain as sole transferee, and rather sulkily\r\noffers to waive his legal claims on being reimbursed what he has already\r\npaid to the transferor. It seems strange that a man who, beside his\r\nnumerous properties in Italy, owned estates[1655] in Mauretania (where he\r\ncomplains that the governors allow his interests to suffer) and in Sicily\r\n(where the lessee is called _conductor_, probably a tenant in chief\r\nsubletting to _coloni_), should have had an appetite for more investments\r\nof doubtful economic value. But other investments were evidently very\r\nhard to find in an age when industry and commerce were fettered by the\r\ncompulsory gild-system. And a man of influence like Symmachus was better\r\nable than one of the common herd to protect his own interests by the\r\nfavour of powerful officials.\r\n\r\nWe get glimpses of the condition of agriculture in Italy under the strain\r\nof events. It must be borne in mind that Italy was no longer exempt from\r\nthe land-burdens of the imperial system. For many years, certainly from\r\n383 to 398, Rome was hardly ever free from the fear of famine. It was\r\nnecessary to scrape together all the spare food that could be found in\r\nthe country in order to eke out the often interrupted importations from\r\nabroad. The decline of food-production in rich Campania is indicated by\r\nmany scattered references. The district was probably too much given over\r\nto vines, and a great part of it occupied by unproductive villas. In 396\r\nSymmachus is relieved to know that the corn-supply of Rome is assured,\r\nat least for twenty days. He goes on to mention[1656] that corn has been\r\ntransferred from Apulia to Campania. Whether this was for Campanian\r\nconsumption, or eventually to be forwarded to Rome, is not stated. I am\r\ninclined to the former alternative by the consideration of the quarrel\r\nbetween Tarracina and Puteoli referred to below. That corn should have\r\nbeen brought from Apulia[1657] is a striking fact. A great part of that\r\nprovince was taken up by pastures and oliveyards. It can only have had\r\ncorn to spare by reason of sparse population and good crops. If we had\r\nthe whole story of this affair, the explanation might prove to be simpler\r\nthan it can be now. In 397 he writes[1658] to a friend that the Apulians\r\nare having a bad time. They are erroneously supposed to be in for a good\r\nharvest, and so are being required to supply corn. This will be stripping\r\nthe province without materially helping the state. For winter is coming\r\non, and there is not time left to bring such a great crop of ripeness.\r\nSymmachus had friends dependent on property in Apulia. Writing some four\r\nyears later[1659] he refers to this estate as rated for taxation on a\r\nhigher scale than its income would warrant: he asks the local governor to\r\nsee that it shall not be crushed by ‘public burdens.’\r\n\r\nFor to Symmachus, as to all or most men in this passive and cruelly\r\nselfish age, the first thought was to protect their own interests and\r\nthose of their friends by engaging the favour of the powerful. Many of\r\nthe passages cited above illustrate this, and many more could be given.\r\nThe candour of some of his applications is remarkable. On behalf of one\r\ndependant in trouble he says[1660] to the person addressed ‘but he will\r\nget more help from the partiality of your judgment, for he really has\r\nsome right on his side.’ To another he writes[1661] that of course right\r\nis always to be considered, but in dealing with _nobiles probabilesque\r\npersonas_ a judge should feel free to qualify strict rules, letting\r\nthe fairness of his decision appear[1662] in the distinction made. This\r\nproposition introduces a request on behalf of his sister. Some farms of\r\nhers are overburdened with the dues exacted by the state, and are now\r\nempty for lack of tenants. Only the governor’s sanction can give them\r\nthe relief needed to restore them to solvency; and Symmachus trusts that\r\nhis friend will do the right thing by the lady. In another case[1663]\r\nhe asks favour for a dependant, significantly adding a request that\r\nhis friend will see to it that the case does not come before another\r\njudge. Now, what chance of asserting their own rights had humble folk\r\nin general, and poor working farmers in particular, when governors and\r\njudges of all sorts were solicited like this by men whose goodwill was\r\nworth securing,—men for the most part unscrupulous greedy and prone to\r\nbear grudges, not such as the virtuous and kindly Symmachus? Perhaps\r\nnothing shews the selfishness of the rich more than their attempts to\r\nshirk the duty of furnishing recruits for the army. Yet we find in one\r\nletter[1664] a request to a provincial governor to check the activities\r\nof the recruiting agents. That the writer accuses these latter of\r\noverstepping their legal powers can only be viewed with some suspicion,\r\nconsidering his readiness to use private influence. Early in 398, when a\r\nforce was being raised to operate against Gildo, it was thought necessary\r\nto enlist slaves from the city households. The protests[1665] of their\r\nowners, in which Symmachus shared, were loud: the compensation allowance\r\nwas too low, and so forth. Yet, if any one was interested in suppressing\r\nthe rebel, it was surely these wealthy men.\r\n\r\nThat the obligation of providing for the sustenance of the idle populace\r\nof Rome was not only a worry to officials but a heavy burden on farmers\r\nin the Provinces whence the supplies were drawn, needs no detailed\r\nproof. But they were used to the burden, and bore it quietly in average\r\nyears. A very bad season might produce dearth even in Africa, and call\r\nfor exceptional measures[1666] of relief on the part of emperors. So\r\nTrajan had relieved Egypt. It was however an extreme step to ease the\r\npressure in Rome by expelling[1667] all temporary residents, as was\r\nactually done during the famine of 383. These would be nearly all from\r\nthe Provinces, and Symmachus uneasily refers[1668] to the resentment that\r\nthe expulsion was certain to provoke. But in this age a rebellion of\r\nprovincials to gain redress of their own particular grievances was not a\r\nconceivable policy. When discontent expressed itself in something more\r\nthan a local riot, it needed a head in the form of a pretender making a\r\nbid for imperial power. But we are not to suppose that Rome, and later\r\nConstantinople, stood quite alone in receipt of food-favours. The case\r\nof two Italian municipalities, reported on[1669] by Symmachus in 384-5,\r\nproves the contrary, and we have no ground for assuming that they were\r\nthe only instances. The important port-town of Puteoli was granted 150000\r\n_modii_ of corn yearly towards the feeding of the city by Constantine.\r\nConstans cut down the allowance to 75000. Constantius raised it again\r\nto 100000. Under Julian a complication arose. The governor of Campania\r\nfound Tarracina in sore straits (evidently for food) because of the\r\nfailure[1670] of the supplies due from the towns long assigned for that\r\npurpose. Now Tarracina had a special claim to support, since it provided\r\nRome with firewood for heating the baths and lime for the repair of the\r\nwalls. It seems that the governor felt bound to keep this town alive, but\r\nhad no new resources on which he could draw. So he took 5700 _modii_ from\r\nthe allowance of Puteoli and gave them to Tarracina. Final settlement was\r\nreferred to Julian, but not reached before his death in the Persian war\r\n(363). The next stage was that a deputation from Capua[1671] addressed\r\nthe emperor Gratian, confining themselves to complaint of their own\r\nlosses. By this one-sided representation they procured an imperial order,\r\nthat the amount of corn allowance which Cerealis[1672] had claimed for\r\nthe people of Rome should be given back to all the cities deprived of it\r\nby his act. But under this order the total recovered for sustenance of\r\nthe provincials only reached 38000 _modii_ of corn that had been added\r\nto the stores of the eternal city. So Puteoli refused to hand over even\r\nthe 5700 to Tarracina. And the provincial governor did not go carefully\r\ninto the terms of the order, but ruled in favour of Puteoli. An appeal\r\nfollowed, and it came out that the grant of 5700 to Tarracina was not an\r\nordinary bounty but an earmarked[1673] sum granted in consideration of\r\nservices to Rome. The governor did not feel able either to confirm it or\r\nto take it away. Therefore the matter was referred to the emperors for\r\na final settlement. This strange story gives us a momentary glimpse of\r\nthings that make no figure in general histories. The abject dependence\r\nof the municipalities on imperial favour stands out clearly: not less\r\nso the precarious nature of such favours, a feature of the time amply\r\nillustrated by the later imperial laws, numbers of which were simply\r\nissued to withdraw privileges previously granted, under the stress of\r\nneeds that made it impossible to maintain them. Again, we see that\r\nin addition to the normal jealousy of neighbours the competition for\r\nimperial favour was an influence tending to hinder rather than promote\r\ncohesion: tending in fact to weaken the fabric now menaced by the tribal\r\nbarbarians. Above all, this affair strongly suggests the partiality of\r\nthe central government to town populations. The farmers of the municipal\r\nterritories were certainly liable to the land-burdens, and were the\r\nultimate basis of imperial finance: but of them there is not a word.\r\nLastly, we may suppose that inter-municipal disputes such as this were\r\nnot of very frequent occurrence: but we have no reason to believe that\r\nthis Campanian case was unique.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIV. AMMIANUS.\r\n\r\nIn =Ammianus Marcellinus= (about 330 to 400) we have an oriental Greek\r\nfrom Antioch who passed a great part of his life in the military service\r\nof the empire. He had travelled much, campaigned in Gaul and the East,\r\nand was an observant man of wide interests, and in his history impartial\r\nto the best of his power. Whether in deliberate criticisms, or in casual\r\nreferences, he is an exceptionally qualified and honest witness as to the\r\nstate of things in the empire. On one important point his evidence is of\r\nspecial value. All through the surviving portion of his work (353-378)\r\nhe leaves us in no doubt that the internal evils of the empire were\r\nweakening it more than the pressure of barbarians from without. He does\r\nnot argue this in a section devoted to the topic, but he takes occasion\r\nto notice the abuses that impaired the prosperity of the Provinces or\r\nled directly to grave disasters. The corruption jealousy greed cruelty\r\nand general misrule of officials high and low was no secret to him.\r\nThat the ultimate sufferers from their misdeeds were the poor, and more\r\nparticularly the poor farmers, may be gathered from many passages. That\r\nthe centre of this all-pervading disease lay in the imperial court,\r\na focus of intrigue and jobbery that the very best of emperors could\r\nnever effectively check, he was surely aware. At least it is only on\r\nthis assumption that we get the full flavour of his references to\r\ncourt-intrigues and his criticisms of emperors, his balanced discussions\r\nof their good and bad qualities and the effects of their policy and\r\npractice. In truth the whole system was breaking down. It lasted longer\r\nin the East than in the West, because the eastern peoples were more\r\nthoroughly tamed. They had been used to despotic government long before\r\nthe coming of Rome. And the assaults of external enemies were more\r\nformidable and persistent in the North and West than in the South and\r\nEast. Yet, so long as the empire held together, imperial despotism was\r\ninevitable. Neither Ammianus nor any other writer of that age did or\r\ncould offer a possible alternative. Christianity might capture the\r\nempire and spread among the barbarians, but it had no constructive\r\nsolution for the problems of imperial government.\r\n\r\nA remarkably plain-spoken passage[1674] occurs in reference to the\r\nevents of 356, where he describes the administration of Julian in Gaul.\r\nBy his victories over the Germans he relieved the impoverished Gauls,\r\nbut this was by no means his only benefit. For instance, where he found\r\nat his first coming a tax-unit[1675] of 25 gold pieces demanded as the\r\n_tributum_, at his departure (360) he left things so much improved that\r\nseven of these sufficed to meet all dues. Great was the joy in Gaul. As\r\na particular example of his thoughtful care, Ammianus cites his policy\r\nin the matter of arrears of tribute. There were occasions, especially\r\nin provinces liable to invasion, when it was certain that such arrears\r\ncould not be recovered in the ordinary course. It was not to the interest\r\nof the central government to ruin or turn adrift farmers whose places\r\nit would not be easy to fill. This consideration was no doubt used to\r\nprocure from emperors orders of remission, _indulgentiae_[1676] as they\r\nwere called. Julian to the last would not give relief by thus waiving\r\nthe imperial rights. ‘For he was aware[1677] that the effect of that\r\nstep would be to put money into the pockets of the rich; the universal\r\npractice, as everyone knows, being for the poor to be made to pay up\r\nthe due amount in full directly the order of collection is issued, and\r\nallowed no time of grace.’ It seems then that it was not the amount of\r\nthe imperial taxation, but the iniquities perpetrated in connexion with\r\nits collection, that were the real burden crushing the vitality of the\r\nProvinces. So thought Julian, rightly: and in the next year we find him\r\nfirmly upholding his principles in the face of exceptional difficulties.\r\nThe emperor Constantius had felt compelled to make Julian Caesar, and\r\nto place him at the head of the Western section of the empire. But his\r\njealousy and fear of the Caesar’s winning glory in Gaul led him to\r\nsurround Julian with officers devoted to himself and secretly encouraged\r\nto hamper their titular chief in every possible way. The court of\r\nConstantius was a hotbed of intrigue and calumny. Private reports of\r\nthe doings of Julian were being regularly received. Any reforms that he\r\nwas able to make in Gaul had to be effected in the teeth of imperial\r\nmalignity.\r\n\r\nA flagrant instance[1678] is seen in the efforts made to thwart his\r\nreforming energy during the winter of 357-8. After defeating and humbling\r\naggressive German tribes, he set himself to relieve the distress of the\r\nlandowners, who had suffered great losses. There was at the time a great\r\nneed of money. The praetorian prefect of the Gauls, Florentius, proposed\r\nto raise the sums required[1679] by an additional levy, and procured\r\nfrom Constantius an order to that effect. Julian would rather die than\r\nallow this. He knew what would happen in carrying it out, and that such\r\n‘precautions’ (_provisiones_)[1680] or rather destructions (_eversiones_)\r\nhad often brought provinces into the extremities of want. The Prefect,\r\nto whose department the matter in strictness belonged, protested loudly,\r\nrelying on the powers given him by Constantius. But Julian stood firm,\r\nand tried to soothe him by calmly proving that there was no necessity for\r\nthe proposed measure. Careful calculations shewed that the normal impost\r\n(_capitatio_) would produce enough to furnish the needful supplies, and\r\nsomething to spare. He would have nothing to do with the order[1681]\r\nfor an extra levy. The Prefect duly reported this to Constantius, who\r\nreprimanded the Caesar for his obstinacy. Julian replied that the\r\nprovincials had been exposed to ravages from various quarters, and that\r\nif they were still able to render the usual dues[1682] the government\r\nhad reason to be thankful. To wring more out of men in distress by\r\npunishments was impossible. And he did manage to prevent extraordinary\r\nexactions in Gaul. In the winter of 358-9 he continued the same policy.\r\nHe saw to the equitable assessment[1683] of the tribute, and kept at bay\r\nthe horde of rascally officials who made fortunes[1684] out of injuring\r\nthe people. The corruption of the law-courts he checked by hearing the\r\nimportant cases himself. No wonder that in an age of Christian emperors\r\nthe virtuous pagan earned a reputation as a restorer of Roman greatness\r\nfar beyond the boundaries of Gaul. Whether the fact that adherents of\r\npolytheism were now chiefly to be found among rustics (_pagani_) had\r\nanything to do with Julian’s clear appreciation of the sufferings of\r\ncountryfolk, is a question on which I cannot venture to offer an opinion.\r\n\r\nThat all or most of the corn levied by imperial taxation was in the\r\nfrontier Provinces required for the military commissariat is well known,\r\nand the granaries for storing it were a leading feature of permanent\r\ncamps and garrison towns. The feeding of armies in the field, always\r\nwasteful, no doubt consumed a great deal. In the case of Gaul (for to\r\nlive on the country was starvation to a force invading wild Germany)\r\nthe quantity to be brought up to the front seems to have been normally\r\nmore than Gaul could spare. It was usual to rely on the harvests[1685]\r\nof Britain. Transport was the main difficulty. Saxon pirates infested\r\nthe narrow seas, and the navigation of the Rhine was blocked by Franks.\r\nJulian’s energy cleared away these obstacles, and saw to the erection\r\nor repair of granaries in the Rhineland towns to receive the British\r\ncorn. These measures enabled him to do without making extra demands on\r\nthe farmers of Gaul, a step sometimes unavoidable when there was war\r\non the frontiers. Of course such commandeering was very unpopular, and\r\nwise generals avoided it whenever possible. Ammianus draws particular\r\nattention[1686] to this matter when narrating the campaign of Theodosius\r\nin Mauretania (373). He forbade the levy of supplies from the\r\nprovincials, announcing that he would make the stores of the enemy[1687]\r\nprovide the commissariat, and the landowners were delighted.\r\n\r\nAmong the interesting references that occur in the course of the work are\r\nsome that throw further light on the conditions of life in the parts of\r\nthe empire subject to invasion. It is not necessary to cite the frequent\r\nmention of various kinds of fortified posts from great strongholds to\r\nmere blockhouses. These remind us that the strength of the imperial\r\narmies could never be so maintained as to guard the frontier at all times\r\non all points. Barbarian raiders slipped through[1688] the inevitable\r\ngaps, and wide stretches of country were laid waste long before\r\nsufficient forces could be gathered to expel them. We do not need the\r\ndescriptions of their cruel ravages to convince us that agriculture near\r\nthe Danube or Rhine borders was a perilous calling. If the farmer were\r\nnot carried away into bondage or slain, he was left robbed of his all,\r\nand in imminent danger of starving: for the barbarians ate up everything,\r\nand hunger was a principal motive in leading them to come and warning\r\nthem to return home. Naturally it was the custom in these border-lands\r\nto provide fortified refuges here and there in which local farmers could\r\nfind temporary shelter with their belongings, and homesteads of any\r\nimportance were more or less equipped for defence. This was the state of\r\nthings even in Mauretania. We read of a farm[1689] (_fundus_) which the\r\nbrother of Firmus the rebel leader (373) ‘built up after the fashion of a\r\ncity’; also of one girt with a strong[1690] wall, a very secure refuge\r\nfor the Moors, to destroy which Theodosius had to employ battering-rams.\r\nThese are not the only instances. And forts (_castella_) and walled towns\r\nare often referred to. Along the northern borders the necessity for such\r\nprecautions was much greater. Still it seems that few if any in the\r\nlatter part of the fourth century foresaw that frontier defences would\r\nat no distant date give way before the barbarian flood. A high imperial\r\nofficial, with whose corrupt connivance[1691] gross wrongs had been\r\nperpetrated (370) in Africa, on being superseded in office withdrew to\r\nhis native Rhineland, and ‘devoted himself[1692] to rural affairs.’ The\r\nretired ease for which he apparently hoped was soon ended, though not by\r\nbarbarian raiders. The malignity of a praetorian prefect tracked him to\r\nhis retreat and by persecution drove him to suicide.\r\n\r\nThis last episode may remind us that the weakening of the empire was\r\nnot wholly due to failure of an economic kind or to decay of military\r\nskill. The farmers might raise crops enough, the armies might prove their\r\nsuperiority in the field, but nevertheless the great organism was in\r\ndecline. A general mistrust, fatal to loyal cooperation for the common\r\ngood, was the moral canker by which the exertions of farmer and soldier\r\nwere hampered and rendered vain. Officials seeking to ruin each other,\r\nemperors turning to murders and confiscations as a source of revenue, all\r\nclasses bound fast in rigid corporations or gilds under laws which it\r\nwas their study to evade; the failure of individual enterprise, lacking\r\nthe joy of individual freedom, and the stimulus of expected reward; in\r\nshort, everyone ready to sacrifice his neighbour to save his own skin:\r\nhow was a society characterized by such phenomena to maintain a moral\r\nadvantage over the rude barbarians? That it was now protected by alien\r\nswords, that aliens were even commanding[1693] the Roman armies, was\r\nnot the main cause of its overthrow. As a rule these barbarians kept\r\ntheir bargain, and shed their blood freely for the empire that enlisted\r\nthem in masses. But we must distinguish between two or three different\r\nclasses of these alien defenders. The mere mercenaries need not detain\r\nus. More significant were the contingents taken over in large bodies by\r\nagreement with the tribes. A good instance[1694] is that of the year\r\n376, when a vast host of Goths sought leave to pass the Danube with the\r\nhope of settling on vacant lands south of the river. We are told that\r\nthe Roman commanders on that front got over their first alarm and took\r\nthe line that really the emperor was in luck. Here was a huge supply of\r\nrecruits[1695] brought to him from the ends of the earth, an unlooked-for\r\nreinforcement ready to be blended with his own troops, and to make up\r\nan unconquerable army. Instead of spending the yearly payments of the\r\nprovinces[1696] on filling up the ranks, the treasury would gain a great\r\nsum of gold. It would seem that they reported to the emperor in favour\r\nof the request, for Valens granted the petition of a Gothic embassy.\r\nArrangements were made for transporting them over the river, and it was\r\nunderstood that they had leave to settle in the parts of Thrace. But\r\nnow troubles began. Greedy Roman officials fleeced and maltreated the\r\nhungry horde, who were at length driven into rebellion. With the sequel,\r\nthe great battle (378) near Adrianople, and the death of Valens, we are\r\nnot here concerned. But the account[1697] of their ravages in Thrace\r\ngives us a picture of the countryside in a harassed province and of the\r\nslave labour employed. The rebels, unable to take fortified places by\r\nregular siege, overran the country in raiding bands. Captives guided them\r\nto places stocked with food. But they were especially encouraged and\r\nstrengthened by the great number of people of their own race who came\r\npouring in to join them. Ammianus describes[1698] these deserters as\r\nmen who had long before been sold (into slavery of course) by traders,\r\nand with them very many whom at the time of their passing the river,\r\nwhen they were perishing of hunger, they had bartered for thin wine or\r\nworthless scraps of bread.\r\n\r\nThis scene may serve to remind us that slavery and the sale of slaves to\r\nRoman dealers were recognized features of German tribal life as described\r\nby Tacitus. It also gives us a glimpse of the way in which opportunities\r\nof imperial advantage could be wasted or turned into calamities by the\r\nunpatriotic and selfish greed of Roman officials. In this case potential\r\nrecruits were turned into actual enemies; and the barbarian slaves, who\r\nshould have been tilling Thracian fields in the interest of Rome, were\r\nleft to guide and recruit the hostile army of their kinsmen. It must\r\nnot be supposed that all schemes for raising barbarian troops in large\r\nbodies were thus by gross mismanagement brought to a disastrous end. The\r\nvalue of sound flesh and blood in the ranks was well understood, and a\r\nsuccessful campaign against German tribes could be made profitable from\r\nthis point of view. Thus in 377, when Gratian had a whole tribe at his\r\nmercy, he required of them a contingent[1699] of sturdy recruits to be\r\nincorporated in Roman army-units, on delivery of whom he set free the\r\nrest to return to their native homes. That such recruits became under\r\nRoman discipline so far Romanized as to provide efficient armies is\r\nclear from the victories that still delayed the fall of the empire. But\r\n‘Roman’ was becoming more than ever a mere name-label: there had never\r\nbeen a Roman nation. Of the third class of alien soldiery little need be\r\nsaid. Military colonists of barbarian origin had for a long time past\r\nbeen brought into the empire, some as frontier guards holding land on\r\ncondition of army service, others more in the interior, even[1700] in\r\nItaly; and these latter undoubtedly furnished many recruits, on whatever\r\nterms. The general result may be summed up in saying that, when the\r\nbarbarian invaders at last came to stay, they found their kindred already\r\nthere at home.\r\n\r\n\r\nLV. CLAUDIAN.\r\n\r\nIn =Claudian=, who wrote about 400, we have another oriental Greek,\r\nwho wrote chiefly in Latin with far more mastery of that language than\r\nAmmianus. Stilicho his patron, the great barbarian head of the Roman\r\narmy, was at the height of his power, and Claudian’s most congenial\r\noccupation was to sing his praises and denounce his opponents. He was\r\nalso poet laureate of the feeble emperor Honorius. Writing mainly on\r\ncontemporary themes, he is, if allowance be made for his bias, a witness\r\nworth citing; but the passages relevant to the present subject are\r\nnaturally few. In common with other writers of the later ages of Rome\r\nhe is constantly looking back to a great and glorious past, contrasting\r\npainfully with that present which he nevertheless is striving to glorify.\r\nThus he not only refers with enthusiasm[1701] to the old heroes of Roman\r\nhistory and legend, the common material of Roman literature, but even\r\ndreams[1702] of a golden age to be, when the earth of her own accord\r\nshall render all good things in abundance to a people living happily in\r\ncommunistic brotherhood. This fancy however is no more than a piece of\r\nunreal rhetoric, an echo of Vergil. It is inspired by the victories of\r\nStilicho, and the world-dominion under which this beatific vision is to\r\nbe realized is—the rule of Honorius.\r\n\r\nIn January 395 the great Theodosius died, and the empire was divided\r\nbetween his two sons. In November, Rufinus, who dominated Arcadius at\r\nConstantinople, was murdered. His place was soon taken by the eunuch\r\nEutropius. On these two personages Claudian poured out a flood of\r\ninvective, speaking for Stilicho and the West. The greed of Rufinus\r\nis depicted[1703] as ruinous to the landed interests. ‘The fertility\r\nof his land was the ruin of the landlord: a good crop[1704] made the\r\nfarmers tremble. He drives men from their homes, and thrusts them out\r\nof their ancestral borders, either robbing the living or seizing the\r\nestates of the dead.’ The jealousy of the West expresses itself in a\r\npassage[1705] referring to the famine created in Rome by the rebellion\r\nof Gildo in Africa. Honorius (that is Stilicho) is effusively praised\r\nfor its relief by importations from other Provinces, chiefly from Gaul.\r\nThat, owing to the claim of the New Rome to the corn of Egypt, the\r\nOld Rome should be so dependent on Africa, is a situation indignantly\r\nresented[1706] in eloquent lines. A symptom ominous of imperial failure\r\nwas the attempt to wrest eastern Illyricum from the rule of Arcadius\r\n(407-8) an enterprise[1707] secretly concerted between Stilicho and\r\nAlaric. Fugitives from Epirus sought refuge in Italy. Stilicho treated\r\nthem as prisoners of war from an enemy’s country, and handed them over\r\nto Italian landlords as slaves or _coloni_. When Alaric and his Goths\r\nmoved towards Italy, some of these refugees, aided by a law issued for\r\ntheir protection, found their way home again. Claudian unblushingly\r\ndeclares[1708] that none but Stilicho will be able to heal the empire’s\r\nwound: ‘at length the _colonus_ will return to his own borders and the\r\ncourt will once more be enriched by the tributes of Illyricum.’\r\n\r\nA Roman view of the intruding barbarians and their capacity of peaceful\r\nsettlement is in one place[1709] put into the mouth of Bellona the\r\nwar-goddess. She addresses a Gothic chief in bitter sarcasm. ‘Go and\r\nbe a thorough ploughman, cleaving the soil: teach your comrades to lay\r\naside the sword and toil at the hoe. Your Gruthungians[1710] will make\r\nfine cultivators, and tend vineyards in accordance with the seasons.’ She\r\ntaunts him with degenerating from the good old habits of his race, war\r\nand plunder, and scornfully describes him as one captured[1711] by the\r\nglamour of fair dealing, who had rather live as a serf on what is granted\r\nhim than as a lord on what he takes by force. In short, he is a coward.\r\nNow no doubt there were Goths and others, Huns in particular, of this\r\nwar-loving work-hating type approved by the war-goddess. But abundant\r\nevidence shews that many, perhaps most, of the barbarians were quite\r\nready to settle down in peace and produce their own food. When Claudian\r\nhimself speaks[1712] of the ‘Teuton’s ploughshare’ as one of the agencies\r\nproducing corn that relieved famine in Rome, he is most likely referring\r\nto the many Germans already settled in Gaul as well as to inhabitants of\r\nthe ‘Germanies,’ the two provinces along the Rhine.\r\n\r\nA curious passage[1713] in the poem on the Gothic war and Stilicho’s\r\ndefeat of Alaric at Pollentia (402) is of interest in connexion with the\r\nRoman army and the recruiting system. Of the confidence revived in Rome\r\nby the appearance of Stilicho and his troops a vivid picture is drawn,\r\nand he continues ‘henceforth[1714] no more pitiful conscription, no more\r\nof reapers laying down the sickle and wielding the inglorious javelin\r\n... nor the mean clamorous jangling of amateur leaders: no, this is the\r\npresence of a genuine manhood, a genuine commander, a scene of war in\r\nreal life.’ If this means anything, it implies that hasty levies[1715]\r\nof raw countrymen were notoriously unfit to face hordes of barbarian\r\ntribesmen in the field. True, no doubt; professional training had been\r\nthe basis of efficiency in Roman armies ever since the days of Marius.\r\nBut the words surely suggest further that conscription within the empire\r\nwas in Claudian’s time not found a success, that is in producing a\r\nsupply of fit recruits to keep the legions up to strength. This also was\r\ndoubtless true, as much other evidence attests, and was the main reason\r\nwhy the ‘Roman’ soldiery of the period were mostly barbarians. But here,\r\nas usual, the witness of the court-poet is in the form of admission\r\nrather than statement. His business was to be more Roman than Rome. It\r\nremains only to mention two similes, one of which perhaps refers to free\r\nlabour. An old crone[1716] has ‘poor girls’ under her engaged in weaving.\r\nThey beg for a little holiday, but she keeps them at work ‘to earn their\r\njoint livelihood.’ This may be a scene from life, but is more likely\r\nan echo from earlier poetry. When he illustrates[1717] the effect of\r\nStilicho’s coming on the peoples rising against Rome by comparing them\r\nto slaves, deceived by false report of their lord’s death, and caught\r\nrevelling by him when he unexpectedly returns, it is a scene that might\r\nbe enacted in any age. The little poem on the old man of Verona is famous\r\nas a picture of humble contentment in rustic life. But the main point of\r\nit as evidence is that the case is exceptional.\r\n\r\n\r\nLVI. VEGETIUS.\r\n\r\n=Vegetius=, a contemporary of Ammianus and Claudian, is credited with\r\ntwo surviving works, one on the military system, the other on veterinary\r\npractice. Both are largely compilations, and belong to the class of\r\ntechnical writings which formed a great part of the literature of this\r\nage. In discussing army matters the author looks back with regret to\r\nthe sounder conditions of the past. Speaking[1718] of the quality of\r\nrecruits, he says ‘It can surely never have been matter of doubt that\r\nthe common countryfolk are more fit (than townsfolk) to bear arms, reared\r\nas they are in toil under the open sky, able to stand the heat of the sun\r\nand caring not for the shade, with no experience of baths or knowledge\r\nof luxuries, straightforward and frugal, with limbs hardened to endure\r\nany kind of toil; for the wearing of armour, digging of trenches, and\r\ncarrying their kit, are continuations of rustic habit.’ It is true that\r\nsometimes town-bred recruits have to be levied, but they need long and\r\ncareful training to fit them for active service. True, the Romans of old\r\nwent out to war from the city. But luxury was unknown in those days:\r\nthe farmer of today was the warrior of tomorrow, by change of weapons.\r\nCincinnatus went straight from the plough to be dictator. A little after,\r\nspeaking[1719] of the standard of height, he tells us that it has always\r\nbeen usual to have a standard tested by actual measurement, below which\r\nno recruit was passed for service in certain crack units. But there\r\nwere then[1720] larger numbers to draw from, and more men followed the\r\ncombatant service, for the civil service[1721] had not as yet carried off\r\nthe pick of those in military age. Therefore, if circumstances require\r\nit, strength rather than height should be the first consideration. I am\r\nloth to infer much[1722] from this passage, the period referred to in\r\n‘then’ being undefined. What it does shew is that in the writer’s own\r\ntime a considerable number of men of military age (Romans being meant)\r\nwere attracted by the civil career of the new imperial service, which\r\nin all its grades was technically styled[1723] a _militia_. Nor does\r\nit appear certain that in preferring the rustic recruit to the urban\r\nVegetius implies the existence of a plentiful supply of the former among\r\nthe subjects of the empire. His words rather suggest to me the opposite\r\nconclusion, which is in agreement with the evidence from other sources.\r\n\r\nTurning to the veterinary work (_ars mulomedicinae_) we come upon a\r\nchapter devoted[1724] to the management of horses. It is well to keep a\r\nfree space near the stable for the beasts to get exercise by rolling,\r\nfor they need exercise. ‘And for this end it is very helpful to have\r\nthem mounted[1725] often and ridden gently. Unskilful riders spoil both\r\ntheir paces and their temper. Most mischievous is the recklessness[1726]\r\nof slaves. When the master is not there, they urge his horses to gallop,\r\nusing spur as well as whip, in matches of speed with their mates or in\r\nfiercely-contested races against outsiders: it never occurs to them to\r\nhalt or check their mounts. For they give no thought[1727] to what is\r\ntheir master’s loss, being well content that it falls on him. A careful\r\nowner will most strictly forbid such doings, and will only allow his\r\ncattle to be handled by suitable grooms who are gentle and understand\r\ntheir management.’ We must bear in mind that the horse was not used in\r\nagriculture or as an ordinary beast of burden. Horse-breeding was kept\r\nup to supply chargers for war, racers for the circus, mounts for men\r\nof the wealthier classes in hunting or occasionally for exercise, for\r\nsolemn processions and such like. When Vegetius treats of a stable or\r\nstud of horses, he has in mind the establishment of a gentleman of means,\r\nand it is worth noting that such an establishment could be contemplated\r\nby a writer of about 400 AD. This harmonizes with the picture of\r\nItalian conditions that we get from the letters of Symmachus and other\r\nsources. A few rich were very rich, the many poor usually very poor.\r\nThe carelessness, wastefulness, thievishness, of slaves is a very old\r\nstory, and in the middle of the fourth century had been bitterly referred\r\nto[1728] by the emperor Julian. That Vegetius does not advise the owner\r\nof these slave grooms to make a _vilicus_ responsible for seeing that his\r\norders are obeyed, is probably due to the rigidly technical character of\r\nthe treatise: he is not writing on the management of estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN WRITERS\r\n\r\n\r\nLVII. LACTANTIUS.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the Christian writers, whom it is convenient to take\r\nby themselves, we pass into a different atmosphere. Of rhetoric there\r\nis plenty, for most of them had been subjected to the same literary\r\ninfluences as their Pagan contemporaries. But there is a marked\r\ndifference of spirit, more especially in one respect very important\r\nfrom the point of view of the present inquiry. Christianity might\r\ncounsel submission to the powers that be: it might recognize slavery\r\nas an institution: it might enjoin on the slave to render something\r\nbeyond eye-service to his legal master. But it could never shake off\r\nthe fundamental doctrine of the equal position of all men before their\r\nAlmighty Ruler, and the prospect of coming life in another world, in\r\nwhich the standards and privileges dominating the present one would go\r\nfor nothing. Therefore a Christian writer differed from the Pagan in his\r\nattitude towards the poor and oppressed. He could sympathize with them,\r\nnot as a kindly though condescending patron, but as one conscious of\r\nno abiding superiority in himself. The warmth with which the Christian\r\nwitnesses speak is genuine enough. The picture may be somewhat overdrawn\r\nor too highly coloured, and we must allow for some exaggeration, but in\r\ngeneral it is surely true to fact.\r\n\r\nFirst comes =Lactantius=, who has already[1729] been once quoted. Writing\r\nunder Constantine, he speaks of the Diocletian or Galerian persecution\r\nas a contemporary. The passage[1730] to be cited here describes the\r\nappalling cruelty of the fiscal exactions ordered by Galerius to meet\r\nthe pressing need of the government for more money. It was after the\r\nabdication of Diocletian and Maximian in 305. The troubles that ensued\r\nhad no doubt helped to render financial necessities extreme. The remark,\r\nthat he now practised against all men the lessons of cruelty learnt\r\nin tormenting the Christians, must refer to Galerius. The account of\r\nthe census[1731], presumably that of 307, is as follows. ‘What brought\r\ndisaster on the people and mourning on all alike, was the sudden letting\r\nloose of the census on the provinces and cities. Census-officers, sparing\r\nnothing, spread all over the land, and the scenes were such as when an\r\nenemy invades a country and enslaves the inhabitants. There was measuring\r\nof fields clod by clod, counting of vines and fruit trees, cataloguing\r\nof every sort of animals, recording of the human[1732] heads. In the\r\nmunicipalities (_civitatibus_) the common folk of town and country put\r\non the same[1733] footing, everywhere the market-place crammed with the\r\nhouseholds assembled, every householder with his children and slaves.\r\nThe sounds of scourging and torturing filled the air. Sons were being\r\nstrung up to betray parents; all the most trusty slaves tortured to give\r\nevidence against their masters, and wives against husbands. If all these\r\nmeans had failed, men were tortured for evidence against themselves,\r\nand when they broke down under the stress of pain they were credited\r\nwith admissions[1734] never made by them. No plea of age or infirmity\r\navailed them: informations were laid against the invalids and cripples:\r\nthe ages of individuals were recorded by guess, years added to those\r\nof the young and subtracted from those of the old. All the world was\r\nfilled with mourning and grief.’ In short, Romans and Roman subjects\r\nwere dealt with as men of old dealt with conquered foes. ‘The next\r\nstep was the paying[1735] of moneys for heads, a ransom for a life.\r\nBut the whole business was not entrusted to the same body of officials\r\n(_censitoribus_); one batch was followed by others, who were expected to\r\nmake further discoveries: a continual doubling of demands went on, not\r\nthat they discovered more, but that they made additions arbitrarily, for\r\nfear they might seem to have been sent to no purpose. All the while the\r\nnumbers of live stock were falling, and mankind dying; yet none the less\r\ntribute was being paid on behalf of the dead, for one had to pay for\r\nleave to live or even to die. The only survivors were the beggars from\r\nwhom nothing could be wrung, immune for the time from wrongs of any sort\r\nby their pitiful destitution.’ He goes on to declare that, in order to\r\nprevent evasion of the census on pretence of indigence, a number of these\r\npoor wretches were taken out to sea and drowned.\r\n\r\nIn this picture[1736] we may reasonably detect high colouring and perhaps\r\ndownright exaggeration. Probably the grouping together of horrors\r\nreported piecemeal from various quarters has given to the description\r\nas a whole a somewhat deceptive universality. That the imperial system,\r\nthough gradually losing ground, held its own against unorganized\r\nbarbarism for several more centuries, seems proof positive that no\r\nutter destruction of the economic fabric took place in the census to\r\nwhich Lactantius refers. But that the pressure exerted by the central\r\npower, and the responsive severity of officials, were extreme, and\r\nthat the opportunities for extortion were seized and cruelly used, may\r\nfairly be taken for fact on his authority. This was not the beginning\r\nof sufferings to the unhappy tillers of the soil, nor was it the end.\r\nOne census might be more ruinous to their wellbeing than another: it\r\nwas always exhausting, and kept the farmers in terror. But they had\r\nnot as yet reached the stage of thinking it better to bear the yoke of\r\nbarbarian chieftains than to remain under the corrupt and senseless\r\nmaladministration of imperial Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nLVIII. SULPICIUS SEVERUS.\r\n\r\nThe life and doings of the famous saint of Gaul, Martin of Tours, a\r\nPannonian by birth, were chronicled by =Sulpicius Severus=, writing soon\r\nafter 400, in an enthusiastic biography still in existence. In another\r\nwork occurs a passage[1737] narrating one of his hero’s many miracles;\r\nand the story is too artlessly illustrative of the behaviour of the\r\nmilitary and the state of things on the public roads, not to be mentioned\r\nhere. Martin was travelling on his ecclesiastical duties, riding on an\r\nass with friends in company. The rest being for a moment detained, Martin\r\nwent on alone for a space. Just then a government car (_fiscalis raeda_)\r\noccupied by a party of soldiers was coming along the road. The mules\r\ndrawing it shied at the unfamiliar figure of the saint in his rough and\r\ndark dress. They got entangled in their harness, and the difficulty of\r\ndisentangling them infuriated the soldiers, who were in a hurry. Down\r\nthey jumped and fell upon Martin with whips and staves. He said not a\r\nword, but took their blows with marvellous patience, and his apparent\r\nindifference only enraged them the more. His companions picked him up all\r\nbattered and bloody, and were hastening to quit the scene of the assault,\r\nwhen the soldiers, on trying to make a fresh start, were the victims\r\nof a miracle. No amount of beating would induce the mules to stir.\r\nSupernatural influence was suspected and made certain by discovery of the\r\nsaint’s identity. Abject repentance was followed by gracious forgiveness,\r\nand mules and soldiers resumed their journey. Now the point of interest\r\nto us is the matter-of-fact way in which this encounter is narrated. That\r\na party of the military should bully peaceful civilians on the high road\r\nis too commonplace an event to evoke any special comment or censure.\r\nBut it is clearly an edifying fact that violence offered to a holy man\r\ndid not escape divine punishment. There is no suggestion that similar\r\nbrutality to an ordinary rustic would have met with any punishment human\r\nor divine. Laws framed for the protection of provincials[1738] against\r\nillegal exactions and to prevent encroachments of the military[1739]\r\nremained on the statute-book, but in remote country parts they were dead\r\nletters. It is interesting to recall that Martin had in his youth served\r\nfor some years as a soldier. As the son of a veteran, his enrolment[1740]\r\ncame in the ordinary course. But, though he is said to have been\r\nefficient, he did not like the profession and got his discharge with\r\nrelief. His life covered about the last three quarters of the fourth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIX. SALVIAN.\r\n\r\nThe calamities that befel the Roman world in the fourth century led\r\nto much recrimination between Pagan and Christian, each blaming the\r\nother for misfortunes generally regarded as the signal expression of\r\ndivine wrath. Symmachus had been answered by Ambrose, and Christian\r\ninterpretation of the course of human history produced its classic in\r\nAugustine’s great work _de civitate Dei_ early in the fifth century.\r\nAbout the same time Orosius wrote his earnest but grotesque _historiae\r\nadversus paganos_, an arbitrary and superficial distortion of history,\r\ninteresting as a specimen of partisan composition. But it is not till\r\nthe middle of the century that we come upon a Christian author who gives\r\nus a graphic picture of the sufferings of the people in a Province of\r\nthe empire, and a working theory of their causes, strictly from a pious\r\nChristian’s point of view. This is =Salvian=, an elder of the Church at\r\nMassalia. His evidence is cited by all historians, and must be repeated\r\nhere. The main thesis is that all the woes and calamities of the age\r\nare judgments of God provoked by the gross immorality[1741] of the\r\nRoman world. So far from imputing all vices and crimes to the Heathen\r\nand the Pagan, he regards them as shared by all men: but he draws a\r\nsharp line between those who sin in ignorance, knowing no better, and\r\nthose who profess the principles of a pure Christianity and yet sin\r\nagainst the light that is in them. For the barbarians are either Heathen\r\nor Heretics (he is thinking of the Arians), while in the empire the\r\nOrthodox church prevails. And yet the barbarians prosper, while the\r\nempire decays. Why? simply because even in their religious darkness the\r\nbarbarians are morally superior to the Romans. For our present purpose\r\nit is the economic and social phenomena as depicted by Salvian that are\r\nof interest, and I proceed to give an abstract of the passage[1742] in\r\nwhich he expounds his indictment of Roman administration and the corrupt\r\ninfluences by which it is perverted from the promotion of prosperity and\r\nhappiness to a cause of misery and ruin.\r\n\r\nThe all-pervading canker is the oppression of the poor by the rich. The\r\nheavy burdens of taxation are thrown upon the poor. When any relief is\r\ngranted, it is intercepted by the rich. Franks Huns Vandals and Goths\r\nwill have none of these iniquities, and Romans living among those\r\nbarbarians also escape them. Hence the stream of migration sets from us\r\nto them, not from them to us. Indeed our poor folk would migrate in a\r\nbody, but for the difficulty of transferring their few goods their poor\r\nhovels and their families. This drives them to take another course. They\r\nput themselves under the guardianship and protection of more powerful\r\npersons, surrendering[1743] to the rich like prisoners of war, and\r\nso to speak passing under their full authority and control. But this\r\nprotection is made a pretext for spoliation. For the first condition\r\nof protection is the assignation[1744] of practically their whole\r\nsubstance to their protectors: the children’s inheritance is sacrificed\r\nto pay for the protection of their parents. The bargain is cruel and\r\none-sided, a monstrous and intolerable wrong. For most of these poor\r\nwretches, stripped of their little belongings and expelled from their\r\nlittle farms, though they have lost their property, have still to bear\r\nthe tribute on the properties lost: the possession is withdrawn, but\r\nthe assessment[1745] remains: the ownership is gone, but the burden\r\nof taxation is crushing them still. The effects of this evil are\r\nincalculable. The intruders (_pervasores_) are settled down (_incubant_)\r\non their properties, while they, poor souls, are paying the tributes on\r\nthe intruders’ behalf. And this condition passes on to their children. So\r\nthey who have been despoiled by the intrusion[1746] of individuals are\r\nbeing done to death by the pressure of the state (_publica adflictione_),\r\nand their livelihood is taken from them by squeezing as their property\r\nwas by robbery. Some, wiser or taught by necessity, losing their homes\r\nand little farms through intrusions or driven by the tax-gatherers to\r\nabandon them through inability to keep them, find their way to the\r\nestates of the powerful, and become[1747] serf-tenants (_coloni_) of\r\nthe rich. Like fugitives from the enemy or the law, not able to retain\r\ntheir social birthright, they bow themselves[1748] to the mean lot of\r\nmere sojourners: cast out of property and position, they have nothing\r\nleft to call their own, and are no longer their own masters. Nay, it is\r\neven worse. For though they are admitted (to the rich men’s estates) as\r\nstrangers (_advenae_), residence operates to make them[1749] natives of\r\nthe place. They are transformed as by a Circe’s cup. The lord of the\r\nplace, who admitted them as outside[1750] aliens, begins to treat them\r\nas his own (_proprios_): and so men of unquestioned free birth are being\r\nturned into slaves. When we are putting our brethren into bondage, is it\r\nstrange[1751] that the barbarians are making bondsmen of us?\r\n\r\nThis is something beyond[1752] mere partisan polemic. It finds the source\r\nof misery and weakness in moral decay. Highly coloured, the picture is\r\nsurely none the less true. The degradation of the rustic population\r\npresents itself in two stages. First, the farmer, still owning his\r\nlittle farm (_agellus_, _rescula_), finds that, what with legal burdens\r\nand illegal extortions, his position is intolerable. So he seeks the\r\nprotection[1753] of a powerful neighbour, who exploits his necessities.\r\nApparently he acquires control of the poor man’s land, but contrives\r\nto do it in such a form as to leave him still liable to payment of the\r\nimperial dues. That this iniquity was forbidden[1754] by law mattered\r\nnot: corrupt officials shut their eyes to the doings of the rich. From\r\nthe _curiales_ of the several communities no help was to be looked for.\r\nSalvian declares[1755] that they were tyrants to a man. And we must not\r\nforget that they themselves were forced into office and held responsible\r\nfor paying in full the dues they were required to collect. The great\r\nmachine ground all, and its cruel effects were passed on from stronger\r\nto weaker, till the peasant was reached and crushed by burdens that he\r\ncould not transmit to others. The second stage is the inevitable sequel.\r\nThe poor man’s lot is more intolerable than before. His lesson is learnt,\r\nand he takes the final step into the status of a rich man’s _colonus_.\r\nHenceforth his lord is liable[1756] for his dues, but he is himself the\r\nlord’s serf, bound to the soil on which his lord places him, nominally\r\nfree, but unable to stir from the spot[1757] to which his labour gives a\r\nvalue. If he runs away, the hue and cry follows him, and he is brought\r\nignominiously back to the servile punishment that awaits him—unless he\r\ncan make his way to some barbarian tribe. Whether he would find himself\r\nso much better off in those surroundings as Salvian seems to imply, must\r\nbe left doubtful. Any family that he might leave behind would remain in\r\nserfage under conditions hardly improved by his desertion.\r\n\r\n\r\nLX. APOLLINARIS SIDONIUS.\r\n\r\nThe last of our array of witnesses is =Apollinaris Sidonius=[1758] (about\r\n430-480), a writer whose life is singularly illustrative of the confused\r\nperiod in which the Roman empire was tottering and the series of luckless\r\nemperors was ended in the West. Britain had been finally lost in the time\r\nof Honorius. The Armorican provinces had rebelled, and even now the hold\r\nof Rome on them was slight and precarious. The rest of Gaul and much\r\nof Spain and Africa had been subject to barbarian inroads, and numbers\r\nof the invaders were settled in the country: for instance, the Western\r\nGoths were fully established in Aquitania. But the Roman civilization\r\nwas by no means wiped out. Roman landlords still owned large estates:\r\nRomans of culture still peddled with a degenerate rhetoric and exchanged\r\ntheir compositions for mutual admiration. Panegyrics on shadowy emperors\r\nwere still produced in verse and prose, and the modern reader may often\r\nbe amazed to note the way in which the troubles of the time could be\r\ncomplacently ignored. Above all, there was the Church, closely connected\r\nwith Rome, claiming to be Catholic and Orthodox, a stable organization,\r\nable to make itself respected by the barbarians. That the latter were\r\nArian heretics was indeed a cause of friction, though the Arians were\r\ndestined to go under. The conversion of the Franks under the Catholic\r\nform did not give Roman Christianity the upper hand till 496. But the\r\npower of bishops, ever growing[1759] since the days of Constantine, was\r\nthroughout a powerful influence holding the various communities together,\r\nmaintaining law and order, and doing much for the protection of their own\r\npeople. A native of Lugudunum, the chief city of Gaul, Sidonius came of a\r\nnoble and wealthy family, and his social position evidently helped him in\r\nhis remarkable career. In 468 he was city prefect at Rome, barely eight\r\nyears before Odovacar removed the last of the titular Western emperors.\r\nWe find him anxiously concerned[1760] with the old food-question, like\r\nhis predecessor Symmachus, and not less endeavouring to cooperate\r\nharmoniously with the _praefectus annonae_. For a hungry rabble, no doubt\r\nfewer in number, still hung about the Eternal city, though its services\r\nin the way of applause were no longer in appreciable demand.\r\n\r\nFrom about 471 Sidonius was bishop[1761] of Arverni (Clermont in\r\nAuvergne), and performed his difficult duties with efficiency and\r\ndignity, a sincerely pious man with a good deal of the _grand seigneur_\r\nabout him. Moving about on duty or seeking restful change, he was\r\noften visiting country houses, his own or those of friends, receiving\r\nor returning hospitality. His references to these visits lead to\r\ndescriptions[1762] of many pleasant places, and pictures of life in the\r\nsociety of cultivated gentlemen to which he belonged. There is hardly any\r\nmention of the suffering farmers of whom Salvian speaks so eloquently.\r\nYet I hesitate to charge Salvian with gross exaggeration and imaginative\r\nuntruth. Not only do the two men look from different points of view.\r\nSidonius is writing some twenty years later than Salvian, and much had\r\nhappened in the meantime. The defeat of Attila in 451 by the armies of\r\nthe Romans and Western Goths had not only saved Gaul from the Huns, but\r\nhad greatly improved the relations between Goth and Roman. And it is to\r\nbe noted that, in a passage[1763] mentioning the victory of the allies\r\nand the reception of Thorismund the Gothic king as a guest at Lugudunum,\r\nSidonius praises his correspondent[1764] for his share in lightening the\r\nburdens of the landowners. Now Salvian knows nothing of the battle of\r\n451, and indeed does not regard the Huns as being necessarily enemies of\r\nRome. It seems certain that for the rustics things were changed for the\r\nbetter. Not that the farmer was his own master, but that the great Roman\r\ntaxing-machine was no longer in effective action. A great part of Gaul\r\nhad passed under Teutonic lords. If the subjects were exposed to their\r\ncaprice, it was of a more personal character, varying with individuals\r\nand likely to be modified by their personal qualities. This was a very\r\ndifferent thing from the pressure of the Roman official hierarchy, the\r\nlower grades of which were themselves squeezed to satisfy the demands\r\nof the higher, and not in a position to spare their victims, however\r\nmerciful their own inclinations might be.\r\n\r\nBut though the establishment of barbarian kingdoms, once the raiding\r\ninvasions were over, had its good side from the working farmer’s point\r\nof view, much of the old imperial system still lingered on. The power\r\nof the Catholic Church stood in the way of complete revolution, and the\r\nChurch was already[1765] a landowner. Roman traditions died hard, and\r\namong them it is interesting to note the exertion of private interest\r\non behalf of individuals and causes in which an honourable patron felt\r\nsome concern. Thus we find Sidonius writing[1766] on behalf of a friend\r\nwho wants to buy back an ancestral estate with which recent troubles\r\nhave compelled him to part. Great stress is laid on the point that the\r\nman is not grasping at pecuniary profit but actuated by sentimental\r\nconsiderations: in short, the transaction proposed is not a commercial\r\none. The person addressed is entreated to use his influence[1767] in\r\nthe applicant’s favour; and we can only infer that he is asked to put\r\npressure on the present owner to part with the property, probably to take\r\nfor it less than the market price. Another letter[1768] is to a bishop,\r\ninto whose district (_territorium_) the bearer, a deacon, fled for refuge\r\nto escape a Gothic raid. There he scratched a bit of church-land and\r\nsowed a little corn. He wants to get in his crop without deductions.\r\nThe bishop is asked to treat him with the consideration usually shewn\r\nto the faithful[1769]; that is, not to require of him the season’s\r\nrent[1770]. If this favour is granted him, the squatter reckons that he\r\nwill do as well as if he were farming in his own district, and will be\r\nduly grateful. Very likely a fair request, but Sidonius does not leave\r\nit to the mere sense of fairness in a brother bishop. To another bishop\r\nhe writes a long letter[1771] of thanks for his thoughtful munificence.\r\nAfter the devastation of a Gothic raid, further damage had been suffered\r\nby fires among the crops. The ensuing distress affected many parts of\r\nGaul, and to relieve it this worthy sent far and wide bountiful gifts\r\nof corn. The happy results of his action have earned the gratitude of\r\nnumerous cities, and Sidonius is the mouthpiece of his own Arverni. The\r\naffair illustrates the beneficence of good ecclesiastics in troubled\r\ntimes. For Gaul was not enjoying tranquil repose. The barbarians were\r\nrestless, and the relations[1772] between their kings and the failing\r\nempire were not always friendly. Religious differences too played a part\r\nin preventing the coalescence of Gallo-Roman and Teuton. The good bishop\r\njust referred to is praised by Sidonius as a successful converter of\r\nheretics.\r\n\r\nThe fine country houses with their vineyards and oliveyards and general\r\natmosphere of comfort and plenty shew plainly that the invasions and\r\nraids had not desolated all the countryside. The first need of the\r\ninvaders was food. Wanton destruction was not in their own interest,\r\nand the requisitioning of food-stuffs was probably their chief offence,\r\nnaturally resented by those who had sown and reaped for their own\r\nconsumption. If we admit this supposition, it follows that their\r\noperations, like those of other successful invaders, would be directed\r\nmainly to the lowland districts, where most of the food-stuffs were\r\nproduced. Now the country houses of Sidonius and his friends were, at\r\nleast most of them, situated in hilly country, often at a considerable\r\ndistance from the main[1773] roads, among pleasant surroundings which\r\nthese kindly and cultivated gentlemen were well qualified to enjoy. It\r\nis evident that some, perhaps many, of these snug retreats were not\r\nseriously[1774] molested, at all events in southern and south-eastern\r\nGaul. Roughly speaking, the old and most thoroughly Romanized provinces,\r\nthe chief cities of which were Lugudunum and Narbo, were still seats\r\n(indeed the chief seats) of Roman civilization. It was there that the\r\nculture of the age survived in literary effort sedulously feeding on the\r\nproducts and traditions of the past. Sidonius thinks it a pity[1775] that\r\nmen of education and refinement should be disposed to bury their talents\r\nand capacity for public service in rural retreats, whether suburban or\r\nremote. The truth probably was that town life had ceased to be attractive\r\nto men unconcerned in trade and not warmly interested in religious\r\npartisanship. The lord of a country manor, surrounded by his dependants,\r\ncould fill his store-rooms and granaries[1776] with the produce of their\r\nlabour. He still had slaves[1777] to wait on him, sometimes even to work\r\non the land. With reasonable kindliness and care on his part, he could be\r\nassured of comfort and respect, the head of a happy rustic community. The\r\nmansions of these gentry, sometimes architecturally[1778] fine buildings,\r\nwere planted in spots chosen for local advantages, and the library was\r\nalmost as normal a part of the establishment as the larder. Some of the\r\nowners of these places gave quite as much of their time and attention to\r\nliterary trifling as to the management of their estates. The writing of\r\nletters, self-conscious and meant for publication, after the example of\r\nPliny the younger, was a practice of Sidonius. The best specimen of this\r\nkind is perhaps the long epistle[1779] in which he describes minutely\r\na place among the foot-hills of the Alps. Every attraction of nature\r\nseconded by art is particularized, down to the drowsy tinkling of the\r\nbells on the mountain flocks accompanied by the shepherd’s pipe. No doubt\r\nthe effective agriculture[1780] of Gaul had little in common with these\r\nArcadian scenes. The toiling _coloni_, serfs of a barbarian chief or a\r\nRoman noble, were all the while producing the food needed to support\r\nthe population; and it is a convincing proof of the superficiality of\r\nSidonius as an observer of his age that he practically ignores them.\r\n\r\nTo attempt a full description of society in Roman Gaul of the fifth\r\ncentury is quite beyond my scope. It has already been admirably done by\r\nSir Samuel Dill. But there are a few points remaining to be discussed as\r\nrelevant to my subject. That the decline of the middle class, and the\r\npassing of large areas of land into few hands, was a process forwarded by\r\ninability to pay debts incurred, is extremely probable. It had been going\r\non for many centuries. But I do not see that the evidence of Sidonius\r\nsuggests that this evil was in his time especially prevalent. The case\r\ncited[1781] is peculiar. The borrower is expressly stated not to have\r\nmortgaged any of his land. The loan was only secured by a written bond\r\nwhich fixed the interest[1782] at 12% per annum. This had been ten years\r\nin arrear, and the total debt was now doubled. The debtor fell ill, and\r\npressure was put on him by officials employed to collect debts. I infer\r\nthat the lack of real security prompted this dunning of a sick man, for\r\nfear the personal security might lapse by his death. Sidonius, a friend\r\nof the creditor, undertook to plead with him for at least some stay of\r\naction. This man had lately been ordained, and Sidonius (not yet himself\r\nin orders, I think,) was evidently surprised to note the simple religious\r\nlife led by him in his country villa. And he needed little entreaty, but\r\nacted up to what he considered his duty to a brother Christian. He not\r\nonly granted further time for payment, but remitted the whole of the\r\naccrued interest, claiming only the principal sum lent. Such conduct may\r\nhave been, and probably was, exceptional; but I cannot argue from it that\r\nheartless usurers were eating up the small landowners of Gaul.\r\n\r\nSo too the case of the young man[1783] of good position who cast off a\r\nslave mistress and wedded a young lady of good family, reputation, and\r\nproperty, may have been exceptional. Sidonius takes it all very coolly,\r\nand mildly improves the occasion. A far more interesting affair is one\r\nin a lower station of life, of which I must say a few words. In a brief\r\nletter[1784] to his friend Pudens he says ‘The son of your nurse has\r\nraped my nurse’s daughter: it is a shocking business, and would have made\r\nbad blood between you and me, only that I saw at once you did not know\r\nwhat to do in the matter. You begin by clearing yourself of connivance,\r\nand then condescend to ask me to condone a fault committed in hot\r\npassion. This I grant, but only on these terms, that you release[1785]\r\nthe ravisher from the status of a Sojourner, to which he belongs by\r\nbirth; thus becoming his patron instead of his lord. The woman is free\r\nalready. And to give her the position of a wedded wife, and not the\r\nplaything of caprice, there is but one way. Our scamp for whom you\r\nintercede must become your Client[1786] and cease to be a Tributary,\r\nthus acquiring the quality of an ordinary Commoner rather than that of a\r\nSerf.’ Sidonius is as usual ready to make the best[1787] of a bad job.\r\nFrom his proposal I draw the following conclusions. First, as to the\r\nnurses. The _nutrix_, like the Greek τροφός, held a position of trust\r\nand respect in the household, consecrated by immemorial tradition. No\r\nslave had a higher claim to manumission, if she desired it. It would\r\nseem that Sidonius’ ‘mammy’ was ending her days as a freedwoman, and\r\nhence her daughter was free. It looks as if the nurse of Pudens were\r\nstill a slave, and her son an _inquilinus_ on the estate of Pudens.\r\nHe may very well have been tenant of a small holding, practically a\r\nserf-tenant. Pudens is still his _dominus_. His quality of _inquilinus_\r\nattaches to him in virtue of his _origo_; that is, he is registered in\r\nthe census-books[1788] as a human unit belonging to a particular estate\r\nand taken into account in estimating taxation-units. Therefore he is\r\n_tributarius_[1789]. Sidonius proposes to divest him of the character of\r\nserf and make him an ordinary Roman citizen. The difference this would\r\nmake is probably a purely legal one. Being at present a Serf, probably in\r\nstrict law a slave also, his connexion with the girl is a _contubernium_.\r\nHis manumission[1790] (for such it really is) will enable him to convert\r\nit into a _matrimonium_, carrying the usual legal responsibilities.\r\nThe practical change in his economic position will probably be nil. He\r\nwill still remain a dependent _colonus_, but he may perhaps enjoy the\r\nprivilege of paying his own share[1791] of taxes. That Sidonius speaks\r\nof his present condition first as Inquilinate and then as Colonate, is\r\none of many proofs that the two terms now connoted virtually[1792] the\r\nsame thing. Such had already been stated as a fact in a law of Honorius,\r\nwhich was retained by Tribonian in the code of Justinian. Whether the\r\n_inquilini_ were barbarian bondsmen (_hörige_), tenants bound to the soil\r\nlike _coloni_ but the personal property of their landlords, as Seeck\r\nholds; or usually descendants of _coloni_, as Weber thought; is more than\r\nI can venture to decide. I do not think that either hypothesis[1793]\r\nexhausts all the possibilities, and the point is not material to the\r\npresent inquiry. In any case it can hardly be doubted that both classes\r\nconsisted of men who worked with their own hands, only aided in some\r\ncases by slave labour which was far from easy to procure.\r\n\r\n\r\nLXI. CONCLUDING CHAPTER.\r\n\r\nAfter so long a discussion of the surviving evidence, it is time to\r\nsum up the results and see to what conclusions the inquiry leads us in\r\nrespect of the farm life and labour of the Greco-Roman world. And first\r\nas to the figures of the picture, the characters with whose position\r\nand fortunes we are concerned. We find three classes, owner farmer\r\nlabourer, clearly marked though not so as to be mutually exclusive. We\r\ncan only begin with ownership in some form, however rudimentary; for\r\nthe claim to resist encroachment on a more or less ill-defined area\r\nis a phenomenon of even the rude life of hunter-tribes. How private\r\nproperty grew out of common ownership is a question beyond the range\r\nof the present inquiry. It is enough that the owner, whether a clan\r\nor a family or an individual, has a recognized right to use the thing\r\nowned (here land) and to debar others from doing so. But it is clear\r\nthat he may also be the actual manager of its use: he may even supply\r\nin person all the labour needed for turning it to account: in short,\r\nhe may be his own farmer and his own labourer. And legend asserts or\r\nimplies that such was the primitive condition of man when he passed from\r\nnomadic to settled existence. Differentiation of function is therefore\r\na product of time and circumstance, a development varying in date and\r\ndegree among various races and in various portions of the world. Once\r\nthe stage of civilization is reached at which the regular cultivation of\r\nthe same piece of land year by year is the normal means of sustaining\r\nhuman life, we meet the simplest economic figure, the peasant who\r\nsupplies his own needs by his own methods, tilling the soil which in\r\nsome sense he claims as his own. Whether it is his own permanently as\r\nan individual, or temporarily as a member of a village community, is a\r\ndifference immaterial from the present point of view. Nor does it matter\r\nthat his method of dealing with the land may be regulated by principles\r\nconventional in the society to which he belongs.\r\n\r\nDelegation of management is a momentous step, destined to bring important\r\nunforeseen consequences. Many reasons may have rendered it necessary or\r\nat least convenient. It appears in two forms, the actual and relative\r\ndates of which are hardly to be determined with certainty. Either the\r\nowner keeps the profit of the undertaking and bears the loss, or some\r\ndivision of profit and loss between the owner and the manager is the\r\ncondition of the arrangement between the two parties. Ownership is\r\nnot abdicated: nor is it easy to see how, without a clear recognition\r\nof ownership, any system of delegation could arise. But on the first\r\nplan the owner owns not only the land but the service of his delegate.\r\nWhether the man be a client bound to his patron by social custom, or\r\nan agent earning a wage, or a slave the property of his master, he is\r\nmerely a servant in charge. He can be superseded at any moment at the\r\nlandowner’s will. The free tenant on the other hand is a creature of\r\ncontract, and his existence presupposes a community in which the sanctity\r\nof deliberate bargains is considerably developed. Whether the tenant’s\r\nobligation consists in the payment of a fixed rent in money or kind, or\r\nin a share of produce varying with the season’s crop, does not matter.\r\nHe is bound by special law, however rudimentary; and it is the interest\r\nof the community to see that such law is kept in force: for no one would\r\nenter into such bargains if their fulfilment were not reasonably assured.\r\nWhether a certain reluctance to enter into such a relation may perhaps\r\naccount for the rare and doubtful appearance of tenancy in early Roman\r\ntradition, or whether it is to be set down simply to defects of record,\r\nI do not venture to decide. The landlord’s obligation is to allow his\r\ntenant the enjoyment and free use of a definite piece of land on certain\r\nterms for a stipulated period. Further stipulations, giving him the\r\nright to insist on proper cultivation and the return of the land in good\r\ncondition at the end of the tenancy, were doubtless soon added at the\r\ndictation of experience. That tenant farmers with their families usually\r\nsupplied labour as well as management, is surely not to be doubted. That,\r\nin the times when we begin to hear of this class as non-exceptional, they\r\nalso employed slave labour, is attested: that we do not hear of them as\r\nengaging free wage-earners, may or may not be an accidental omission.\r\n\r\nLabour, simply as labour, without regard to the possible profit or loss\r\nattending its results, was no more an object of desire, engaged in for\r\nits own sake, in ancient times than it is now. Domestication of animals,\r\na step implying much attentive care and trouble, was a great advance in\r\nthe direction of securing a margin of profit on which mankind could rely\r\nfor sustenance and comfort. The best instance is perhaps that of the ox,\r\nwhose services, early exploited to the full, were cheaply obtained at the\r\ncost of his rearing and keep. Hence he was kept. But in ages of conflict,\r\nwhen might was right, the difference[1794] between an ox-servant and a\r\nman-servant had in practice no existence, and the days of theory were\r\nas yet in the far future. A human enemy, captured and spared, could be\r\nput to use in the same way as a domesticated ox. His labour, minus the\r\ncost of his keep, left a margin of profit to his owner. At the moment of\r\ncapture, his life was all he had: therefore his conqueror had deprived\r\nhim of nothing, and the bargain was in his favour, though economically in\r\nhis owner’s interest. No wonder then that our earliest records attest the\r\npresence of the slave. Even nomad tribes were attended by slaves[1795]\r\nin their migrations, nor indeed has this custom been wholly unknown in\r\nmodern times. On the other hand it is remarkable how very little we hear\r\nof wage-earning labour in ancient agriculture. Nothing seems to imply\r\nthat it was ever a normal resource of cultivation. When employed, it is\r\nalmost always for special work at seasons of pressure, and it seems to\r\nhave remained on this footing, with a general tendency to decline. In\r\nother words, the margin of profit on the results of wage-earning labour\r\nseemed to employers less than that on the results of slave labour, so far\r\nas ordinary routine was concerned. And we are not in a position to shew\r\nthat in their given circumstances their judgment was wrong. But we need\r\nto form some notion of the position of the wage-earning labourer in a\r\ncivilization still primitive.\r\n\r\nThe main point ever to be borne in mind is that the family household was\r\na close union of persons bound together by ties of blood and religion\r\nunder a recognized Head. A common interest in the family property carried\r\nwith it the duty of common labour. The domestic stamp was on everything\r\ndone and designed. Even the slave had a humble place in the family life,\r\nand family religion did not wholly ignore him. He was there, and was\r\nmeant to stay there. Farm-work was the chief item in the duties of the\r\nhousehold, and he bore, and was meant to bear, his full share of it. But\r\nthe hired labourer stood in no such relation to the household union,\r\nhowever friendly his connexion with his employer might be. He did his\r\nwork, took his wage, and went: no tie was severed by his going, and any\r\nother person of like capacity could fill his place if and when the need\r\nfor help-service arose. In short, his labour was non-domestic, irregular,\r\noccasional: and therefore less likely to receive notice in such records\r\nas have come down to us. But if we conclude (as I am inclined to do) that\r\nwage-labour was not much employed on the land in early times, we must\r\nadmit that this is rather an inference than an attested tradition.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between domestic regular service and non-domestic\r\nhelp-service is essential, and on a small holding from which a family\r\nraised its own sustenance the line of division was easy to draw. Later\r\neconomic changes tended to obscure it, and we find Roman jurists[1796]\r\nof the Empire striving to discover a full and satisfactory answer to\r\na much later question, namely the distinction between a domestic and\r\na rustic slave. But by that time ‘domestic’ appears as ‘urban,’ for\r\nthe effect of centuries has been to draw a really important line of\r\ndivision, not between slave and free but between two classes of slaves.\r\nThere is however in the conditions of early slavery, when ‘domestic’\r\nand ‘rustic’ were merely two aspects of the same thing, another point\r\nnot to be overlooked, since it probably had no little influence on the\r\ndevelopment of human bondage. It is this. The human slave differs from\r\nthe domesticated ox through possession of what we call reason. If he\r\nwished to escape, he was capable of forming deep-laid plans for that\r\npurpose. Now the captives in border wars would be members of neighbouring\r\ntribes. If enslaved, the fact of being still within easy reach of their\r\nkindred was a standing temptation to run away, sure as they would be\r\nof a welcome in their former homes. No kindness, no watchfulness, on\r\nthe master’s part would suffice to deaden or defeat such an influence.\r\nTo solve the problem thus created, a way was found by disposing of\r\ncaptives to aliens more remote and getting slaves brought from places\r\nstill further away. This presupposes some commercial intercourse. In the\r\nearly Greek tradition we meet with this slave-trade at work as a branch\r\nof maritime traffic chiefly in the hands of Phoenician seamen. In Italy\r\nwe find a trace of it in the custom[1797] of selling ‘beyond Tiber,’\r\nthat is into alien Etruria. At what stage of civilization exactly this\r\npractice became established it is rash to guess: we cannot get behind\r\nit. The monstrous slave-markets of the historical periods shew that it\r\ndeveloped into a normal institution of the ancient world. But it is not\r\nunreasonable to suppose that an alien from afar was less easily absorbed\r\ninto his master’s family circle than a man of a neighbouring community\r\nthough of another tribe. Are we to see in this the germ of a change by\r\nwhich the house-slave became less ‘domestic’ and tended to become a human\r\nchattel?\r\n\r\nThe exploitation of some men’s labour for the maintenance of others could\r\nand did take another form in ages of continual conflict. Successful\r\ninvaders did not always drive out or destroy the earlier inhabitants\r\nof a conquered land. By retaining them as subjects to till the soil,\r\nand making the support of their rulers the first charge upon their\r\nproduce, the conquerors provided for their own comfort and became a\r\nleisured noble class. In the Greek world we find such aristocracies of\r\na permanently military character, as in Laconia and Thessaly. Colonial\r\nexpansion reproduced the same or very similar phenomena abroad, as in\r\nthe cases of Heraclea Pontica and Syracuse. The serfdom of such subject\r\npopulations was a very different thing[1798] from slavery. It had nothing\r\ndomestic about it. There is no reason to suppose that the serf was under\r\nany constraint beyond the regular performance of certain fixed duties,\r\nconditions imposed by the state on its subjects, not the personal orders\r\nof an individual owner. In some cases at least the serf seems to have\r\nenjoyed a measure of protection[1799] under public law. Whether the\r\noriginal Roman _plebs_ stood on much the same footing as the Greek serfs\r\nis perhaps doubtful, but their condition presents certain analogies. The\r\nmain truth is that the desire of conquerors to profit by the labour of\r\nthe conquered was and is an appetite almost universal: moral revulsion\r\nagainst crude forms of this exploitation is of modern, chiefly English,\r\norigin; even now it is in no small degree a lesson from the economic\r\nexperience of ages. But it is well to remember that we use ‘serfdom’\r\nalso as the name for the condition of rural peasantry in the later Roman\r\nEmpire, and that this again is a different relation. For it is not a case\r\nof conquered people serving their conquerors. Rather is it an affliction\r\nof those who by blood or franchise represent the conquering people. Step\r\nby step they sink under the loss of effective freedom, though nominally\r\nfree, bound down by economic and social forces; influences that operate\r\nwith the slow certainty of fate until their triumph is finally registered\r\nby imperial law.\r\n\r\nThat the institution of Property is a matter of slow growth, is now\r\ngenerally admitted by sincere inquirers. It had reached a considerable\r\nstage of development when a clan or household (still more when an\r\nindividual) was recognized as having an exclusive right to dispose of\r\nthis or that material object presumably useful to others also. For\r\ninstance, in the right of an owner to do as he would with an ox or a\r\nslave. Individual property in land was certainly a later development, the\r\nappropriation being effected by a combination of personal acquisitiveness\r\nwith economic convenience. From my present point of view the chief\r\ninterest of the property-question is in its connexion with debt-slavery.\r\nThat farmers, exposed to the vicissitudes of seasons, are peculiarly\r\nliable to incur debts, is well known from experience ancient and modern.\r\nBut ancient Law, if rudimentary, was also rigid; and tradition depicts\r\nfor us the small peasant as a victim of the wealthy whose larger capital\r\nenabled them to outlast the pressure of bad times. How far the details of\r\nthis picture are to be taken literally as evidence of solid fact has not\r\nunreasonably been doubted. But that a farmer in straits could pledge not\r\nonly his land but his person as security for a debt seems hardly open to\r\nquestion. For we find the practice still existing in historical periods,\r\nand political pressure exerted to procure mitigation of the ancient\r\nseverity. Now, if a man gave himself in bondage to a creditor until such\r\ntime as his debt should be discharged, he became that creditor’s slave\r\nfor a period that might only end with his own life. Here we have another\r\nway in which the man of property could get the disposal of regular labour\r\nwithout buying a slave in the market or turning to work himself. A later\r\nform of the practice, in which a debtor worked off his liability[1800] by\r\nservice at an estimated rate, a method of liquidation by the accumulation\r\nof unpaid wages, seems to have been a compromise avoiding actual slavery.\r\nEvidently subsequent to the abolition of debt-slavery, it died out in\r\nItaly, perhaps partly owing to the troublesome friction that would surely\r\narise in enforcing the obligation.\r\n\r\nIt is natural to ask, if we find small trace of eagerness to labour in\r\nperson on the land, and ample tradition of readiness to devolve that\r\nlabour on slaves and subjects, how comes it that we find agriculture in\r\nhonour, traditionally regarded as the manual labour beyond all others\r\nnot unworthy of a freeman? To reply that human life is supported by the\r\nproduce of the land is no sufficient answer. To recognize the fact of\r\nnecessity does not account for the sentiment of dignity. Now, in the\r\nformation of such unions as may fairly be called States, the commonest\r\nif not universal phenomenon is the connexion of full citizenship\r\nwith ownership of land. Political movement towards democracy is most\r\nsignificantly expressed in the struggles of landless members of inferior\r\nright to gain political equality. Whether the claim is for allotments of\r\nland, carrying a share of voting-power, or for divorcing the voting-power\r\nfrom landholding, does not matter much here. At any rate it was the rule\r\nthat no alien could own land within the territory of the state, and state\r\nand territory were coextensive. Only special treaties between states,\r\nor a solemn act of the sovran power in a state, could create exceptions\r\nto the rule. From this situation I would start in attempting to find\r\nsome answer to the above question. In a village community I think it is\r\ngenerally agreed that all true members had a share of the produce, the\r\ngreat majority as cultivators, holding lots of land, not as tenants at\r\nwill or by contract, but in their own right, though the parcels might be\r\nallotted differently from time to time. If a few craftsmen were left to\r\nspecialize in necessary trades for the service of all, and drew their\r\nshare in the form of sustenance provided by the cultivating members, the\r\narrangement presented no insuperable difficulty on a small scale. But\r\nthe tillers of the soil were the persons on whose exertions the life\r\nof the community primarily and obviously depended. The formation of a\r\nlarger unit, a State, probably by some successful warrior chief, made a\r\ngreat change in the situation. A city stronghold established a centre\r\nof state life and government, and villages exchanged the privileges and\r\nperils of isolation for the position of local hamlets attached to the\r\ncommon centre of the state, and in this new connexion developing what\r\nwe may fairly call political consciousness. Under the new dispensation,\r\nwhat with growth of markets, the invention of coined money, and greater\r\ngeneral security, the movement towards individual property proceeded\r\nfast. Noble families engrossed much of the best land: and tradition[1801]\r\ncredibly informs us that in one mode or other they imposed the labour of\r\ncultivation on the poorer citizens, of course on very onerous terms.\r\n\r\nAt this point in the inquiry some help may be got from taking the\r\nmilitary view. War, at least defensive war, was a possibility ever\r\npresent. Kings, and the aristocracies that followed them, had as their\r\nprime function to secure the safety of the state. A sort of regular force\r\nwas provided by the obligation of army service that rested upon all full\r\ncitizens. The warrior nobles and their kinsmen formed a nucleus. But the\r\nfree peasant farmers were indispensable in the ranks, and, as their farms\r\nusually lay near the frontier, they furnished a hardy and willing militia\r\nfor border warfare. The craftsmen, smith potter cobbler etc, were now\r\nmore concentrated in the city, and were always regarded as ill-fitted\r\nfor service in the field. Naturally the classes that bore a direct part\r\nin defence of the state stood higher in general esteem. But to say this\r\nis not to say that bodily labour on the land was, as labour, honoured\r\nfor its own sake. The honour belonged to those who, owning land, either\r\nworked it with their own hands or employed the labour of others. I can\r\nfind no trace of traditional respect for the labourer as labourer until\r\na much later age, when a dearth of free rustic labourers had begun to be\r\nfelt. Then it appeared in the form of yearning[1802] for a vanished past,\r\nside by side with humanitarian views in relation to slavery. Meanwhile\r\na stage had been traversed in which slavery was recognized as necessary\r\nin spite of its admitted evils, and therefore requiring justification;\r\na movement most clearly illustrated by the special pleading of\r\nAristotle. That great writer was fully alive to the manifold merits of\r\nthe farmer class as citizens and producers, but his trust in the power\r\nof self-interest proves him a confirmed individualist. How to combine\r\nself-interest with patriotic devotion to the common welfare is the vital\r\nproblem, even now only solved ideally on paper. That coldly-reasoned\r\nconclusions of thinkers were really the foundation of the esteem in which\r\nwe find the working farmer held, I cannot believe. Much more likely is it\r\nthat it sprang mainly from immemorial tradition of a time when ownership\r\nand cultivation went together, and that theory merely absorbed and\r\nrevived what was still an indistinct impression in the minds of men.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks had a significant word, ἀυτουργός, the usage of which may\r\nserve to illustrate my meaning. That it connotes the fact of a man’s\r\nbearing a personal part in this or that work is clear on the face of\r\nit. That no other person also bears a part, is sometimes implied by the\r\ncontext, but it is not necessarily contained in the word itself. To put\r\nit differently, he does his own work, not necessarily all his own work.\r\nI note two points in connexion with it that seem to me important. First,\r\nit is so often used as descriptive of rustic labour that it seems to have\r\ncarried with it associations of farm-life: most of the other uses are\r\nalmost metaphorical, some distinctly so. Secondly, I have never found it\r\napplied to the case of a slave. Why? I think, because it conveyed the\r\nfurther notion of working not only yourself but for yourself. If in some\r\npassages it is not quite certain that an owner (rather than a tenant) is\r\nreferred to, surely this extension of meaning is not such as to cause\r\nsurprise. It is not enough to suggest serious doubt that the common and\r\nfull sense of the word was that a man did work with his own hands on his\r\nown account on his own land. This was the character to which immemorial\r\ntradition pointed; and, whenever tenancy under landlords began, the\r\nword fitted the working tenant-farmer well enough. The Romans had the\r\ntradition in the most definite form, though Latin furnished no equivalent\r\nword. Their literature, moralizing by examples and unapt for theory, used\r\nit as material for centuries. But neither in the Greek world nor in Italy\r\ncan I detect any reason for believing that the peasant farmer, idealized\r\nby later ages, is rightly to be conceived as a person unwilling to employ\r\nslave labour—if and when he could get it. The tradition, in which rustic\r\nslaves appear from very early times, seems to me far more credible than\r\nlate legends of a primitive golden age in which there were no slaves at\r\nall. That a man, to be enslaved, must first have been free, is a piece\r\nof speculation with which I am not here concerned.\r\n\r\nTradition then, looking back to times when landowner and citizen were\r\nnormally but different sides of the same character, both terms alike\r\nimplying the duty of fighting for the state, idealized and glorified this\r\ncharacter with great but pardonable exaggeration of virtues probably\r\nnot merely fictitious. The peasant citizen and producer was its hero.\r\nAs the devolution of bodily labour upon slaves or hirelings became more\r\ncommon with the increase of commerce and urban life, and the solid\r\nworth of a patriot peasantry became more evident in the hour of its\r\ndecay, men turned with regret to the past. And the contrast of the real\r\npresent with an idealized past naturally found a significant difference\r\nin the greater or less willingness of men to work with their own hands,\r\nparticularly on the land. But it was the labour of free citizens, each\r\nbearing an active part in the common responsibilities of the state and\r\nenjoying its common protection, that was glorified, not labour as in\r\nitself meritorious or healthy. The wholesomeness of rustic toil was not\r\nignored, but to urge it as a motive for bodily exertion was a notion\r\ndeveloped by town-bred thinkers. That it coloured later tradition is not\r\nwonderful: its recognition is most clearly expressed in the admission\r\nof superior ‘corporal soundness’ in the sparely-fed and hard-worked\r\nslave or wage-earner. But labour as labour was never, so far as I can\r\nlearn, dignified and respected in Greco-Roman civilization. Poverty, not\r\nchoice, might compel a man to do all his own work; but, if he could and\r\ndid employ hired or slave labour also, then he was an ἀυτουργός none\r\nthe less. This I hold to be an underlying fact that Roman tradition in\r\nparticular is calculated to obscure. It was voluntary labour, performed\r\nin a citizen’s own interest and therefore a service to the state, that\r\nreceived sentimental esteem.\r\n\r\nThe power of military influences in ancient states is often cited as\r\na sufficient explanation of the social fact that non-military bodily\r\nlabour was generally regarded with more or less contempt. The army being\r\nthe state in arms, the inferiority of those who did not form part of it\r\nthough able-bodied was manifest to all. This is true as far as it goes,\r\nbut there was something more behind. Why does not the same phenomenon\r\nappear in modern states with conscript armies, such as France or Italy\r\nor above all Switzerland? I think the true answer is only to be found by\r\nnoting a difference between ancient and modern views as to the nature\r\nand limits of voluntary action. It is only of states in which membership\r\nis fairly to be called citizenship that I am speaking; and as usual\r\nit is Greek conditions and Greek words that supply distinct evidence.\r\nNot that the Roman conditions were materially different, but they were\r\nperhaps less clearly conceived, and the record is less authentic and\r\nclear. Now, beyond the loyal obedience due from citizen to state, any\r\nsort of constraint determining the action of one free man by the will\r\nof others was feared and resented to a degree of which we cannot easily\r\nform an adequate notion. In the gradual emancipation of the commons from\r\nthe dominion of privileged nobles, the long struggle gave a passionate\r\nintensity to the natural appetite for freedom. And the essence of\r\nfreedom was the power of self-disposal. This power was liable to be lost\r\npermanently by sale into slavery, but also from time to time by the\r\neffect of temporary engagements. The most obvious instance of the latter\r\ncondition was the bondage created by unpaid debt. Hence the persistent\r\nand eventually successful fight to make it illegal to take a borrower’s\r\nperson as security for his debt. But, suppose the debt cancelled by the\r\nseizure of his goods, the man was left a pauper. His only resource was\r\nto work for wages, and this placed him for the time of his engagement at\r\nthe full disposal[1803] of his employer. If he was not a master’s slave\r\nfor good and all, he would be passing from master to master, ever freshly\r\nreminded of the fact that his daily necessities subjected him to the will\r\nof others, nullifying his freeman’s power of self-disposal. If he worked\r\nside by side with slaves, there was a further grievance. For the slave,\r\nin whom his owner had sunk capital, had to be kept fed and housed to\r\nretard his depreciation: the free labourer depended[1804] on his wage,\r\nliable to fail. The situation, thus crudely stated, was intolerable.\r\nIn practice it was met, first by devotion to handicrafts as a means of\r\nlivelihood in which the winning of custom by skill relieved the worker\r\nfrom direct dependence on a single master; but also by allotments of land\r\nin annexed territory, and sometimes (as at Athens) by multiplication of\r\npaid state-employments.\r\n\r\nOf ordinary artisans, as distinct from artists, it may be said that\r\ntheir position varied according as their special trades were more or\r\nless esteemed by contemporary sentiment. The successful could and did\r\nemploy[1805] helpers, usually slaves. In urban populations they were an\r\nimportant element, particularly in those where military considerations\r\nwere not predominant. The accumulation of capital, and the introduction\r\nof industries on a larger scale in factory-workshops with staffs of\r\nslaves, may have affected some trades to their disadvantage, but on the\r\nwhole the small-scale craftsmen seem generally[1806] to have held their\r\nground. Unskilled labour on the other hand was generally despised. It\r\nwas as a matter of course chiefly performed by slaves. If a citizen\r\nwas compelled by want to hire out his bodily strength, this was not\r\nvoluntary: complete submission to another’s will, even for a short\r\ntime, made the relation on his part virtually servile. Accordingly\r\nphilosophers, when they came to discuss such topics, came to the\r\nconclusion that the need of such unskilled labour proved slavery to be\r\n‘according to nature,’ a necessary appliance of human society. When the\r\nStoic defined a slave as a lifelong hireling, he gave sharp expression\r\nto what had long been felt as a true analogy. For, if the slave was a\r\nlifelong hireling, the hireling must be a temporary slave. Romans could\r\nborrow the thought, but with them practice had preceded theory.\r\n\r\nIn making comparisons between wage-earning ancient and modern we come\r\nupon a difficulty which it is hardly possible to set aside or overcome.\r\nA slave could be hired from his owner, just as a freeman could be hired\r\nfrom himself. The difference between the two cases would be clearly\r\nmarked[1807] in the modern world, and language would leave no room for\r\nmisunderstanding. But many passages in ancient writers leave it quite\r\nuncertain whether the hirelings referred to are free or slave. The\r\npoint is an important one, particularly to inquirers who attempt to\r\nestimate the relative economic efficiency of free and slave labour. For\r\nthe immediate interest of the freeman is to get a maximum of wage for\r\na minimum of work: the ultimate interest of the hired slave was often\r\nto improve his own prospect of manumission. The custom was to allow\r\nthe slave to retain a small portion of his wage. Now this stimulus to\r\nexertion was manifestly to the interest of the employer, who may even\r\nhave made it a part of his bargain with the owner. The slave, alive to\r\nthe chance of laying up a little store for the eventual purchase of his\r\nfreedom, was induced to work well in order to be kept employed on these\r\nterms. The owner drew a steady income from his capital sunk in slaves,\r\nand the system was thus convenient to all parties. We may add that, by\r\ncausing a slave to take thought for his own future, this plan encouraged\r\nhim to take reasonable care of his own health, and so far retarded his\r\nprogressive deterioration as an investment; while his owner stood to\r\nrecover the slave’s hoarded wage-portion in the form of redemption-money\r\non manumission of his worn-out slave. There is reason to think that\r\nslave labour under these conditions was often more efficient than free.\r\nUnhappily we have no direct discussion of the question from ancient\r\nobservers, who did not take this point of view, though well aware of the\r\ninfluence of prospective manumission in producing contentment.\r\n\r\nBut how far was this comparatively genial arrangement applicable to the\r\nruder forms of unskilled labour? Take for instance mining. Freemen would\r\nhave none of it, and the inhuman practices of exploiters were notorious.\r\nYet hired slaves were freely employed. Owners knew that their slaves\r\nwere likely to waste rapidly under the methods in use, and at Athens a\r\ncommon stipulation was that on the expiry of a contract the gang hired\r\nshould be returned in equal number, the employer making good the losses\r\ncertain to occur in their ranks. Here we have the mere human chattel,\r\nhopeless and helpless, never likely to receive anything but his keep, as\r\nan engine receives its fuel and oil, but differing in this, that he was\r\nliable to cruel punishment. Such labourers could not work for a freedom\r\nthat they had no prospect of living to enjoy. And how about the case of\r\nagriculture? That freemen did work for wages on farms we know, but we\r\nhear very little of them, and that little almost entirely as helpers at\r\ncertain seasons. So far as I have been able to learn, free wage-labour\r\ndid not really compete with slave labour in agriculture: moreover the\r\nhired man might be a hired slave, while migratory harvesters, probably\r\nfreemen, appear at least in some cases as gangs hired for the job under\r\na ganger of their own, responsible to the employer for their conduct and\r\nefficiency. Most significant is the almost complete absence of evidence\r\nthat rustic slaves had any prospect of manumission. In former chapters\r\nI have commented on this fact and noted the few faint indications of\r\nsuch an arrangement. At all events the crude plantation-system, while it\r\nlasted, was a work-to-death system, though worn-out survivors may have\r\nhad a better lot than miners, if allowed to exist as old retainers on\r\nthe estate. But cultivation by slave labour for the purpose of raising\r\nan income for the landlord was, even in its later improved organization,\r\na system implying brutal callousness, if not downright cruelty. Slave\r\nstewards and overseers, at the mercy of the master themselves, were\r\nnaturally less concerned to spare the common hands than to escape the\r\nmaster’s wrath. When writers on agriculture urge that on all grounds it\r\nis wise to keep punishments down to a minimum, the point of their advice\r\nis surely a censure of contemporary practice.\r\n\r\nNow in modern times, humanitarian considerations being assumed, the\r\nprevailing point of view has been more and more a strictly economic and\r\nindustrial one. It has been assumed that the freedom of an individual\r\nconsists first and foremost in the freedom to dispose of his own labour\r\non the best available terms. And this freedom rests on freedom to move\r\nfrom place to place in search of the best labour-market from time\r\nto time. But the movement and the bargaining have been regarded as\r\nstrictly voluntary, as in a certain sense they are. The power to migrate\r\nor emigrate with the view of ‘bettering himself’ is conferred on the\r\nwage-earner by modern facilities for travel, and new countries readily\r\nabsorb additional labour. But experience has shewn that free bargaining\r\nfor wages is not seldom illusory, since the man of capital can bide\r\nhis time, while the poor man cannot. Still, when every allowance has\r\nbeen made on this score, it is true that the modern labourer, through\r\nfreedom of movement, has far more power of self-disposal than the\r\nwage-earner of the Greco-Roman world. That his position is strengthened\r\nand assured by the possession of political power, is not without ancient\r\nanalogies: but a difference in degree if not in kind is created by the\r\nwide extension of the franchise in modern states, and its complete\r\nseparation in principle from the ownership of land. That is, the basis\r\nof citizenship is domicile: for citizen parentage is not required, but\r\neasily supplemented[1808] by legal nationalization. Moreover, religion is\r\nno longer a necessary family inheritance, but the choice of individuals\r\nwho can generally gratify their preferential sentiments in surroundings\r\nother than their birthplace. Compare this position with the narrow\r\nfranchises of antiquity and their ineffectiveness on any large scale,\r\ntheir normally hereditary character, the local and domestic limitation\r\nof religious ties, the restricted facilities for travel, not to mention\r\nits ever-present perils. Remember that to reside in another state as an\r\nalien did not, in default of special treaty or act of legislative grace,\r\ngive the resident any claim to civic rights in his place of residence,\r\nwhile misfortune might at any time reduce him to slavery in a foreign\r\nland. Surely under such conditions the limits of purely voluntary action\r\nwere narrow indeed. The lure of the wage and the fear of unemployment are\r\noften a severe form of pressure, but they are, as fetters on freedom, a\r\nmere nothing in comparison with this.\r\n\r\nConsiderations such as those set forth in the preceding paragraphs shew\r\nthat in treating of ancient agriculture and farm-labour we are apparently\r\nfaced by a curious paradox. Cultivation of land (including the keeping\r\nof live stock) is an honourable pursuit. That good health, sustenance,\r\neven comfort and profit, are its natural attendants, is not doubted.\r\nBut the position of the labouring hands is painful and mean, so much so\r\nthat a common punishment for urban house-slaves was to send them to work\r\non a farm. The rustic slave’s lot differed for the better from that of\r\nthe mine-slave in the healthier nature of the occupation, but in little\r\nelse. And this degradation inevitably reacted on the estimate of rustic\r\nwage-earners, whenever employed. There may have been less repugnance\r\nto work side by side with slaves than has been felt in modern times,\r\nwhen a marked colour-line implied the disgrace of a ‘white’ man doing\r\n‘niggers’ work.’ But it is not to be doubted that in agriculture as in\r\nother occupations the presence of slavery did degrade labour, at all\r\nevents so soon as agriculture put on anything of an industrial character.\r\nThe really ‘respectable’ person was the man who directed the operations,\r\nthe γεωργός, _agricola_, or _colonus_ (in the original sense): he was\r\nthe man who worked the land and made it yield crops, whether he took\r\npart in the actual digging and ploughing or not. The larger the scale,\r\nthe more he confined himself to direction, necessarily; but he was the\r\nproducer, a pillar of public economy, none the less. He had provided\r\nthe labour, bought or hired; in effect, the labour was his own. With\r\nthe toiling yeoman farmer of tradition he had this in common, that both\r\nworked for themselves, not for another. And this position, attractive\r\nin all societies, was marked out with peculiar distinctness through the\r\ninstitution of slavery underlying the social fabric. Exploitation of\r\nman by man, the first beginnings of which elude our search and are only\r\nascertained by inference, suggests some sort of superiority in the upper\r\nparty. At all events the master, the man who has the upper hand, gets the\r\ncredit of achievement, and in agriculture as elsewhere the subordinate\r\noperative is inevitably forgotten. It is from this point of view that\r\nwe must regard the fine Roman legends of sturdy farmer-citizens, the\r\nfathers of the Republic. They are idylls conveying truth, dressed up by\r\nthe imagination of a later age: and have their place in the region where\r\nhistory and poetry meet and blend. We must not gather from them that\r\nslavery was exceptional or a fact of no importance. Tradition habitually\r\nignores what is normal and therefore assumed. The fairer inference is\r\nthat, as I have already remarked, slavery was in those early days still a\r\nfamily institution, not an industrial system.\r\n\r\nSome help towards the understanding of the different position of manual\r\nlabour in ancient times as compared with modern may be got by considering\r\nAbolitionism. That a slave is a man, and as such not to be wholly\r\nignored in respect of the claims of common humanity; that slave-labour\r\nis listless and ineffective, giving poor returns in proportion to the\r\nstrength employed; these conclusions, moral and economic, were reached by\r\nthe thinkers of the ancient world while their civilization was in full\r\nbloom. Why then do we find no movement corresponding to the Abolitionism\r\nof modern times? Two things were obviously necessary for such a movement;\r\nthe motive to inspire it, and the force to give effect to it. Let men\r\nonce be convinced that slavery is both wrong and unprofitable, and let\r\nthem have the power to insist on putting an end to it, Abolitionism in\r\nsome form or other is the necessary result.\r\n\r\nNow in speaking of ancient conditions we must never lose sight of the\r\nfact that in its origin slavery was a favour. By the undissembled rule\r\nof force the conquered only retained his life through the mercy of the\r\nconqueror. By a contract tacit or expressed he was pledged for life\r\nto the service and profit of his master. And the master could, if his\r\ninterest pointed that way, make over his rights to a third party. Hence\r\nthe growth of a slave-market, and the relation of master and slave no\r\nlonger was normally that of individual conqueror and conquered. But the\r\noriginal notion was by no means extinct, and it continued to colour the\r\ncurrent view of slavery as ‘natural,’ a thing of course, an unquestioned\r\nsocial fact. Nor was there anything in the condition of the slave to\r\narouse a feeling of horror, so long as patriarchal rule prevailed. If the\r\nHead of the family possessed absolute power over the slave, his power\r\nover members of the family in general was in kind the same. The bondman,\r\na humble dependant rather than a mere chattel, was in a sense also a\r\nmember of the family and under the protection of the household gods. What\r\nwas there for an observer, let him be ever so kind-hearted, to object\r\nto? Accordingly, as the state developed, it too kept slaves of its own,\r\nemploying them in mean functions for which it was needful to have a staff\r\nalways at hand. In short, the institution was taken for granted, and\r\ngrowing intercourse with foreigners only served to reveal its universal\r\nprevalence.\r\n\r\nHow came it then that in course of time humanitarian scruples arose,\r\nand questioners were found to argue that the system was ‘unnatural’ and\r\nwrong? The answer must be sought in the application of an originally\r\ndomestic institution to industrial ends. Once the stage was reached at\r\nwhich the products of labour were habitually put on the market, and the\r\nproducer got his living by their regular sale, it was soon discovered\r\nthat to produce and deal on a larger scale was more economical, and\r\ntherefore more profitable, than on a smaller one. In the handicrafts this\r\nwas so obvious that slave assistants were commonly kept by tradesmen:\r\nit was important to be sure of having the necessary help when wanted.\r\nThe same was the case in the professions based on special training:\r\nthe surgeon, the architect, the surveyor, the banker, employed slave\r\nsubordinates, and had often been slaves themselves. In all these\r\ndepartments, not to mention domestic service, the position of the slave\r\nwas affected by two important considerations. First, he was one of a\r\nfew, and under immediate observation, so that escape from servitude\r\nwas practically impossible. Secondly, there was a reasonable chance of\r\nearning manumission by long faithful service. But there were occupations\r\nin which it was far more difficult to reconcile the interests of the\r\nslave with those of the master. Such were the exploitation of mines\r\nand quarries, in which labour was simply applied in the form of brute\r\nforce under direction. The direction, usually entrusted to slave or\r\nfreedman overseers, was generally unsympathetic, sometimes cruel; for the\r\noverseer’s first thought was to please his master, even if he could only\r\ndo so by working the slaves to death. The extension of agriculture as a\r\nmeans of profit rather than subsistence created conditions of the same\r\nkind in this occupation. It was here that the monstrous abuses incidental\r\nto slavery were most strikingly displayed. For, while quarries and mines\r\nwere only worked in a few localities, the plan of working great landed\r\nestates by the labour of slave-gangs was applicable to vast areas of the\r\nbest soil. And in Africa Sicily and Italy we find it so applied for the\r\nprofit of the nobles and capitalists of a conquering race.\r\n\r\nThe evils of this system may be set down to the account of obsequious\r\nstewards heartlessly wringing profit for their masters out of human flesh\r\nand blood. But we must not ignore two considerations which suggest that\r\nthe root of the evil lay not in the caprice or greed of individuals but\r\nin the attempt to carry on rural industry by slave labour at all. In\r\nthe country, opportunities of escape were many; the slave-prison and\r\nthe fetters could hardly be dispensed with if you meant to keep your\r\nfarm-hands at disposal. And manumission, as a means of encouraging good\r\nservice, was evidently not of much avail in country places. For after\r\nlong years of exhausting labour the worn-out slave would be unable to\r\nearn a living by hard bodily work; and he knew no other. He had been\r\nbought as a flesh-and-blood machine; as such, to manumit him while still\r\nefficient would be a sacrifice of sunk capital for which nobody was\r\nprepared. It seems that the ordinary practice was to keep him at work\r\ntill he could work no longer, and then to let him linger on the estate\r\nas an invalid retainer, feeding on what he could get and decaying in\r\npeace. But the industrializing of agriculture, heartlessly selfish in its\r\naims, tempted landlords to shirk the unprofitable maintenance of spent\r\nlabourers. When a slave was no longer worth his keep, it might pay to\r\nsell him at once for what he would fetch. There was thus a mouth less\r\nto be fed, and the problem of how to turn the remnant of his strength\r\nto account was shifted on to his new owner. This plan, approved by the\r\nelder Cato as a detail of farm-economy, marks the change of relations\r\nbetween master and slave in rustic life. The old domestic relation has\r\ndisappeared in the brutal exploitation of a human animal for immediate\r\nprofit. The crudely industrial system reproduced on great estates the\r\nhorrid phenomena of the quarry and the mine.\r\n\r\nThat humane and thoughtful men should be disgusted with such doings was\r\ninevitable, and disgust was soon reinforced by reasonable alarm. For\r\ntillage was not the sole occupation of rustic enterprise. It was found\r\nthat in many districts grazing paid better than tillage, and the two\r\ncould be worked together remuneratively on a large scale. The charge of\r\nflocks and herds, shifting their pasture according to seasons, led to\r\nemployment of able-bodied slaves in a duty responsible and at the same\r\ntime removed from immediate control for months together. These slave\r\nherdsmen, hardy and used to a free life in wild uplands, had to face\r\nwolves and robbers, and therefore to bear arms. We need not dwell on the\r\ndanger from such a class menacing the peace of a country unprotected by\r\nrural police. It was real enough. Being slaves, they had nothing but\r\ntheir lives to lose, and their lives it was their owners’ interest to\r\nprotect. Meanwhile the unescorted traveller was at their mercy, and any\r\npeasants within reach would pay blackmail to escape their raids. Yet\r\nnothing was done to get rid of the nuisance and peril of this state of\r\nthings. Servile risings were clumsily put down with appalling bloodshed,\r\nand left to recur. Meanwhile the free population of the countryside\r\ndiminished, and prosperity could not be restored by new slave-gangs.\r\nSuch was notoriously the condition of a great part of rural Italy under\r\nthe later Republic, and contemporary evidence clearly shews that the\r\nimprovement effected under the Empire was slight.\r\n\r\nNow, when experience had proved the blighting influence of slavery,\r\nwhy was there no movement to do away with the system altogether? Truth\r\nis, there was at present no basis to start from. The moral enthusiasm,\r\noften sincere, that has inspired such movements in modern times, had no\r\neffective existence. Moral considerations were almost entirely confined\r\nto a section of rich or cultivated society. It was not expected that the\r\ncommon herd should rise above the meanest motives of crude self-interest.\r\nThe artisan, who either employed, or hoped soon to employ, a slave or\r\ntwo, was not likely to condemn slavery: the parasitic loafer was not\r\nlikely to welcome a mass of new competitors for the doles and bribes that\r\nhe undeservedly enjoyed. During the last century of the Roman Republic\r\nno opposition to slavery as an institution could have arisen from the\r\nurban populace. And the wealthier classes were interested in slavery.\r\nReligion did not touch the question. A few scrupulous and thoughtful men\r\nmight have supported an anti-slavery movement, had there been one; but we\r\nhave not the smallest reason to think that any individual ever dreamt of\r\nstarting humanitarian propaganda on his own account and at his own risk.\r\nThere was no place in the ancient world for the reformer of this type.\r\nEven those leaders whose policy offered advantages to the free masses,\r\nsuch as the Gracchi or some Spartan kings, did not so fare in their\r\nenterprises as to encourage imitation. As for appealing to the slaves\r\nthemselves, it was only desperate adventurers who did so, and that only\r\nto use their force in promoting criminal designs. Such cases only served\r\nto justify the cruel execution of cruel laws for protecting masters and\r\nthe state in general from the imminent slave-peril. If we turn from the\r\ncity, in which what passed for politics ran its troubled and futile\r\ncourse, to the countryside, we are at once in a scene from which all\r\npolitical life had departed. The farmer-citizens grew fewer and fewer,\r\nand the great majority of them were virtually disfranchised by distance.\r\nNor were they likely to favour any movement that seemed to be for the\r\nbenefit of slaves.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the Empire did not, indeed could not, produce any\r\nmaterial change in the way of arousing effective sentiment hostile to\r\nslavery. But it did much to promote internal order and far-reaching\r\npeace. Under the new model of government the corrupt circles of nobles\r\nand greedy capitalists were no longer in absolute control of the\r\ncivilized world, and it might seem that there was now some chance of\r\ndealing with the canker of slavery. But no such movement was the result.\r\nOld notions remained in full vigour. Augustus had his hands too full,\r\nand the need of conciliating private interests was too pressing, for\r\nhim to disturb them, even had he been minded to do so. And who else\r\ncould take the initiative? But the fate of two moral influences is\r\nworth noting. Stoicism, the creed of not a few ardent spirits, might\r\nprofess to rise superior to worldly distinctions and advantages and\r\nassert the potential dignity of man even in the humblest condition of\r\nlife. But it was always a creed of the few: its aloofness, tending to\r\na certain arrogance, made it unfitted[1809] to lead a great reform: it\r\nneither would nor could furnish the machinery of zealous propaganda.\r\nIn the earlier Empire we find it politically allied with malcontent\r\ncliques in which smouldering resentment at the restraints on ‘freedom’\r\nexpressed itself by idealizing the Republic and hoping for a reaction.\r\nThus it lost itself in impracticable dreams, and the hand of emperors\r\nunder provocation sometimes fell heavily on its most virtuous men. The\r\nspread of Christianity came later, and was not diverted from its aims\r\nby a social affinity with the upper classes. Slaves bore no small part\r\nin its expansion to the West, and it was free to operate steadily as a\r\nhumanitarian influence. But its claim to universality naturally exposed\r\nit to grave suspicion in a world that knew religion only as an affair\r\nof each several community, with a sort of overlordship vested in the\r\nconquering gods of Rome. Though it was a Church and not a philosophic\r\nsystem, though meant for all mankind and not for a cultivated few, it\r\ncould only win its way by accepting civilization[1810] in the main as it\r\nstood. Therefore it was compelled to accept slavery as an institution,\r\nand to content itself with inculcating humanity on masters and\r\nconscientious devotion to duty on slaves. If Abolitionism was to spring\r\nfrom this seed, a long time had to be spent in waiting for the harvest.\r\n\r\nYet the establishment of the Empire did lead to effects that in their\r\nturn served as contributory causes undermining the old slave-system,\r\nparticularly[1811] in agriculture. In a more peaceful age fewer slaves\r\nwere brought to market, and this meant higher prices and put a premium\r\non the economical employment of bought labour. To meet the situation,\r\nagricultural policy was developed on two lines, each of which was the\r\nimprovement or extension of an existing practice. One was the more\r\nscientific organization of the labour-staff, so as to get better results\r\nfrom an equal amount of labour. The other was a more frequent resort to\r\nthe plan of letting farms to tenants, whenever that arrangement seemed\r\nfavourable to the landlord’s interest. Of these developments we have\r\ndirect information from Columella, who still prefers the former plan\r\nwherever feasible. But it was with the system of tenancies on various\r\nconditions that the future really lay. I have endeavoured above to sketch\r\nthe process[1812] by which tenants were gradually reduced to a condition\r\nof dependency on their landlords, and the difficulty of finding and\r\nkeeping good tenants that was the other side of the movement. A very\r\nsignificant detail is the fact that slaves were put into farms[1813] as\r\ntenants: that this was no unusual practice is clear from the way in which\r\nthe classical jurists refer to it as a matter of course. And so things\r\nslowly moved on, with ups and downs, the tenants slave or free becoming\r\nmore and more bondsmen of the land, liable to task-services and not\r\nfree to move at will. Thus by usage, and eventually by law, a system of\r\nserfdom was established, while personal slavery declined.\r\n\r\nLooked at from an Abolitionist point of view, we are here dealing with\r\na sheer evasion of the slavery-question. But this was inevitable. The\r\nimperial government, which alone had the power necessary for attempting\r\nsolutions of grave problems, was doomed to become more and more\r\nmechanical. Under great strains in the third century it lost its vital\r\nforces to such a degree that it was powerless for internal betterment.\r\nThe later despotic Empire, seeing the failure of past policy, could find\r\nno better way than to do as before[1814], only more mechanically and more\r\nthoroughly. What little of freedom of movement and of self-disposal still\r\nremained to the toiling classes accordingly disappeared. Once a certain\r\nnumber had been slaves; now none were practically free. Diminution of\r\npersonal slavery had not increased personal freedom. The attempt to\r\nconfine all labour to fixed grooves and rigid rules was a last desperate\r\neffort to control and employ the resources of ancient civilization, in\r\nthe hope of thus finding means sufficient to endure the ever-growing\r\nstrain upon the empire. This system might serve its purpose for the\r\nmoment, but it was a vain device, killing enterprise and working out\r\nits own ruin through its own stagnation. In agriculture, on which the\r\nwhole fabric rested, its effects were particularly ruinous: for in no\r\noccupation is there greater need of constant forethought and loving care,\r\nwhich the prospect of private advantage alone can guarantee. All these\r\nphenomena may assure us that as yet there was no clear understanding of\r\nthe value of free self-disposal as the economic basis of society. From\r\nthe moral point of view no genuine progress was to be looked for in a\r\nstagnant age. The transition from normal slavery to gild-bondage and\r\nnormal land-serfdom does not seem to have been affected by the spiritual\r\nlevelling of Christianity. But that as she gained power, the Church\r\ndid something to mitigate[1815] the hardness of the time, is not to be\r\ndoubted.\r\n\r\nI need not dwell at length on the contrast presented by modern\r\nanti-slavery movements. The influence of religion, personal and\r\nhumanitarian, is alone enough to account for the new spirit aroused\r\nand organized by Clarkson and Wilberforce. To put down the slave-trade\r\nbecause it was wrong was a momentous step, and emancipation its\r\ninevitable corollary, costly though it might be. That the reform was\r\ncarried out two generations before the handworking masses of England\r\ngained political power is a most notable fact. For it is not possible\r\nto connect the achievement with the natural jealousy of free labour\r\nobjecting to competition of slave labour. In the United States the\r\nmotives for Abolition were necessarily more mixed, but sincere fanatics,\r\nreligious and violent, were the leaders of the crusade. But the\r\nrepugnance of free labour to the recognition of slavery in any part of\r\nthe Republic (and it was this sentiment that furnished the necessary\r\nvoting-power) was not so purely philanthropic. Students of American\r\nhistory are well aware of the moral change brought about by a single\r\nmechanical invention in the southern states. The economic advantages\r\nof the cotton-gin made slavery so profitable that existing tendencies\r\ntowards emancipation died out in the South. A new life was given to a\r\nconfessed evil, and the developed plantation-system, industrialized\r\nfor the profit of a few, went down the road of fate to end in tragedy.\r\nThe result of the great civil war at all events settled one question.\r\nHenceforth labour was to stand on a footing of self-disposal and\r\nwage-earning, with freedom to improve its conditions on those lines. The\r\nsolution, obtained at an awful cost, was final for the time: what will\r\nbe its ultimate outcome is at present (1919) a matter of some doubt, for\r\nreasons not to be discussed here.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Abolitionism is a phenomenon of the modern[1816] world,\r\nand not of the ancient, will not seem insignificant to those who have\r\nread widely in the ancient writers and remarked how very little we hear\r\nof free wage-earning labour. If we deduct the references to independent\r\nartisans practising trades on a small scale (and their cases are not\r\nrelevant here), what we hear of mere wage-earners is very little indeed.\r\nAnd of this little again only a part concerns agriculture. I take it\r\nthat we may fairly draw one conclusion from this: the wishes of the\r\nfree wage-earning class, whatever their numbers may have been, were\r\npractically of no account in the ancient world. From first to last the\r\nprimitive law of superior force, the ‘good old rule’ of which slavery was\r\na product, was tacitly accepted. Civilization might undergo changes of\r\ncharacter, periods of peace might alternate with periods of war: still\r\nbondage and labour were closely connected in men’s minds, and honest\r\nlabour as such commanded no respect. How could it? Of a golden age, in\r\nwhich all men were free and slavery unknown, we have nothing that can\r\nbe called evidence. The curtain rises on a world in which one man is at\r\nthe full disposal of another. What is at first a small domestic matter\r\ncontains the germ of later developments; and in the case of agriculture\r\nwe see clearly how demands of an industrial nature transformed single\r\nbond-service into the wholesale and brutal exploitation of human chattels\r\nin slave-gangs. We have no good reason to believe that men ever in the\r\nancient world abstained from employing slave labour out of humanitarian\r\nscruples. Scarcity of slaves, or lack of means to buy them, were\r\ncertainly the main restrictive influences. The institution was always\r\nthere, ready for extension and adaptation as changing conditions might\r\nsuggest. If ancient civilization did not rest on a basis of slavery, on\r\nwhat did it rest? Assuredly not on free self-disposal. The man free to\r\ndispose of himself claimed the right to dispose of others, up to the\r\nlimits of his own power and will. In this there is nothing wonderful.\r\nWe need not flatter ourselves that the rule of force is now extinct.\r\nTrue, personal bondage to individuals is forbidden by law, but effective\r\nfreedom of self-disposal, perhaps an impossible dream, is not yet\r\nrealized: only its absence is dissembled under modern forms.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that ancient civilization rested on a basis of slavery, the\r\ncondition present to my mind is this. A social and political structure\r\nrequires for its stability a reasonably sound economic foundation. This\r\nfoundation is found in the assured and regular use of natural resources.\r\nAnd this use implies the constant presence of an obedient labour-force\r\nthat can be set to work and kept working as and when needed. This force\r\nis now more and more supplied by machinery, the drudge that cannot\r\nstrike. Antiquity made the slave its quasi-mechanical drudge: the more or\r\nless of slavery at a given moment simply depended on circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn returning to my original questions, whether the growth of Greco-Roman\r\ncivilization was in fact achieved through the system of slavery, and\r\nwhether it could conceivably have been accomplished without slavery, I\r\nhave I think given my answer to the first, that is, so far as agriculture\r\nis concerned. And agriculture was the vital industry, on which the whole\r\nfabric principally rested. As to the second question, I can give no\r\nsatisfactory answer. For my part, I agree with those who hold that, in\r\nthe conditions of antiquity as depicted in our traditions and inferred by\r\nmodern inquirers, slavery in some form and degree was an indispensable\r\ncondition of progress. States, organizations of a lasting kind, had\r\nto be established by force. Captive labour, added to the resources of\r\nconquerors, seems to be a powerful means of increasing their economic\r\nstrength and abridging the wasteful periods of conflict. But, once the\r\nstage had been reached at which a state was sufficiently stable and\r\nstrong to provide for order within and to repel invaders, a slave-system\r\nbecame a canker, economic, social, ultimately political. I believe that\r\nthe maladies from which the old Greco-Roman civilization suffered, and\r\nwhich in the end brought about its decay and fall, were indirectly or\r\ndirectly due to this taint more than to any other cause. I know of no\r\ncase ancient or modern in which a people have attained to a sound and\r\nlasting prosperity by exploiting the servitude of other men. Serfdom or\r\nslavery, it matters not. So far as human experience has gone, it appears\r\nthat all such conditions are eventually ruinous[1817] to the rulers.\r\n\r\nFor it is not merely the degradation of manual labour that results from\r\nslavery. The deadening of inventive genius and economic improvements\r\nis fatally promoted through the tendency to remedy all shortcomings by\r\nsimply using up more flesh and blood. Man abdicates a most important\r\nfunction of his reason, and accepts a mere superiority of animal over\r\nanimal. This is surely not following the true law of his development. It\r\nis from this point of view that the great scientific inventions of modern\r\ntimes present an encouraging spectacle, as the earlier abuses of their\r\nexploitation are gradually overcome, and the operative citizen vindicates\r\nhis claims as a human being. That ancient slavery did in some ways\r\nact for good by guaranteeing leisure to classes some of whom employed\r\nit well, may be freely admitted. But I do not think we can sincerely\r\nextend the admission to include the case of Politics, whatever Greek\r\nphilosophers may have thought. Nor can we without reservations apply\r\nit in the field of Art. On the other hand Literature surely owed much\r\nto the artificial leisure created by slavery. Even in its most natural\r\nutterances Greco-Roman literature is the voice of classes privileged\r\nbecause free, not restrained by the cramping influences of workaday life\r\nand needs. Its partisan spirit is the spirit of the upper strata of\r\nsociety, ignoring the feelings, and often the existence, of the unfree\r\ntoilers below. In the main aristocratic, it tells us next to nothing\r\nof the real sentiments of even the free masses, particularly on the\r\nlabour-questions that have now for some time increasingly occupied the\r\npublic mind. That we are, for good or for evil, viewing all matters of\r\nhuman interest on a different plane from that of the ‘classic’ writers,\r\nis a consideration that students of the Past are in duty bound never to\r\nforget.\r\n\r\nBut, when we are told[1818] that ancient civilization in its early stages\r\n(as seen in the Homeric poems etc) may fairly be labelled as Medieval,\r\nwhile it may be called Modern when in its full bloom, we shall do well to\r\npause before accepting a dogma that may imply more than we are prepared\r\nto grant. That mankind had to make a fresh start in the Middle Ages,\r\nancient civilization having run its course and failed, is a proposition\r\ndangerously true. If it implies that the ‘free’ labour of modern times\r\nis not a direct development from ancient slavery, so far good. If we\r\nare to hold that ancient slave labour and modern free labour, when and\r\nso far as each is a factor of economic importance, are practically\r\nidentical phenomena of capitalism eager to make a profit out of cheap\r\nlabour, we may ask—is the parallelism so exact as it is thus represented\r\nto be? When we are told that the capitalist would nowadays prefer to\r\nemploy slave labour if it were to be had, and that the legal form in\r\nwhich labour is supplied is a secondary consideration from the economic\r\npoint of view, we begin to hesitate: is this really true? Was not the\r\nineffectiveness of slave labour detected in ancient times? Was it not\r\nproved to demonstration in America, as attested by the evidence of both\r\nNorthern and Southern witnesses? To reply that what capital wants is\r\nnot mere slave labour but efficient slave labour, would be no answer.\r\nCapital is not, and never was, blind to the inefficiency of slave labour\r\nas compared with free labour. In the pursuit of profit it needs a supply\r\nof labour at its immediate and certain disposal; therefore it takes what\r\nit can get. In the ancient world the unquestioned institution of slavery\r\noffered a source of supply, not ideal, but such as could be relied on.\r\nTherefore capital employed slavery to extend its operations, simply\r\nturning existing conditions to account. And the admission, that the\r\nmost flourishing period of Greco-Roman civilization was also the period\r\nin which slavery reached its greatest development, is surely a virtual\r\ndenial that the basis of that civilization was free labour. That is, free\r\nwage-earning labour. For the independent farmer or artisan had nothing to\r\ndo with the matter: he worked for himself, not for another, and was on a\r\ndifferent plane from either wage-earner or slave. If he did not employ\r\neither wage-earner or slave, it was because he found such help too costly\r\nor a doubtful boon.\r\n\r\nThe case of agriculture at once reveals what was found to be the strong\r\npoint of slave labour, the feasibility of employing it in large masses.\r\nMuch of the work consisted in the mere mechanical use of brute force,\r\nand one overseer could direct many hands. In operations dependent on\r\nthe seasons, the labour must be at hand to utilize opportunities. The\r\nchoice lay between slaves not working with a will and free wage-earners\r\nnot likely to be on the spot when wanted. Why were slaves preferred?\r\nBecause their presence in sufficient number could be relied on in the\r\nexisting conditions of the world. The history of industrial agriculture\r\nwas a long tale of effort so to organize slave labour as to get out of\r\nit the greatest possible margin of profit. Not that slavery was thought\r\npreferable in itself; but a means of wholesale cultivation had to be\r\nfound, and the then available resources of civilization offered no other.\r\nWhen the supply of slaves began to fail, landlords sought a remedy in\r\nletting some or all of their land to tenant farmers (extending an old\r\npractice), not in attempting to farm on their own account with hired\r\nlabour. Hired labour remained as before, an occasional appliance to meet\r\ntemporary needs.\r\n\r\nThe use of the terms Medieval and Modern as labels[1819] for ancient\r\ncivilization in two clearly marked stages has, I repeat, just enough\r\ntruth in it to be dangerous. As a rhetorical flourish it may pass. But\r\nit conveys by suggestion much that cannot be accepted. No doubt it is\r\nnot meant to imply that what we call the Middle Ages is to be ignored.\r\nBut it inevitably tends to stifle a belief in historical continuity, a\r\nfaith in which is the soul of historical inquiry as generally understood\r\nin the present day. That modern labour-conditions shew a powerful\r\nreaction against medieval, is obvious: that medieval conditions have not\r\ninfluenced the modes of this reaction, is to me incredible. I do not\r\nbelieve that the modern free wage-earning system could have grown out\r\nof the ancient slave-labour system, had there been no such intervening\r\nperiod as the ‘Middle Ages.’ That the aims of the capitalist ancient and\r\nmodern are the same, is a mere truism: but is not the same true of the\r\nmedieval capitalist also?\r\n\r\nThat the wage-earning handworker often finds his freedom of self-disposal\r\nlimited in practice, though his position is very far removed from\r\nslavery, I have pointed out above. Also, that modern facilities for\r\nmovement have helped materially to assert and enlarge his freedom. From\r\nthis point of view the discovery of the New World was the turning-point\r\nof European history. But in course of time capitalistic phenomena\r\nappeared there also, and on a larger scale. And now, almost the whole\r\nworld over, the handworker is striving, not only for higher wages but\r\nfor more complete self-disposal. This necessitates some control of the\r\nindustries in which he works. Individual effort being vain, he forms\r\nunions to guard his interests. The unions, acting by strike-pressure,\r\ncome into conflict with governments representing the state. The next\r\nstep is to employ political pressure by gaining and using votes under\r\nrepresentative systems, so as to remodel legislation and administration\r\nin a sense favourable to the handworker. This movement, now well under\r\nway in the most civilized countries, is not perhaps socialistic in\r\nprinciple, and we do not yet know how far it is likely to take that turn.\r\nIn order to fight exploitation, the handworker has to surrender a good\r\ndeal of his individual freedom: whether he will be content to surrender a\r\ngood deal more, the coming age will see. This much at least is clear,—the\r\nhandworking wage-earners are no longer, as in the ancient world, a class\r\nof no account. That they have wrung so many great concessions from\r\nunwilling capitalists seems to me a proof that their freedom, even under\r\nmedieval[1820] restrictions, had always in it something real, some\r\nquality that sharply distinguished it from ancient slavery. In ancient\r\nslavery I can see no germ out of which betterment of labour-conditions\r\ncould conceivably arise. It simply had to die, and modern attempts to\r\nrevive it have had to die also.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing pages I have recognized two lines of distinction. One is\r\nthat commonly admitted, the line that parts freeman from slave. The other\r\nis that between free wage-earner and slave. In looking back from modern\r\ncircumstances to ancient, the latter is much the more important. For, now\r\nthat slavery in the proper sense has been abolished by modern civilized\r\npeoples, the conditions of wage-earning stand out as presenting the most\r\nmomentous issues of the present age. To the statesmen the questions\r\nraised are full of anxiety as to the probable influence of present\r\npolicies on future wellbeing. A student of Greco-Roman civilization must\r\nask himself whether modern labour-questions and their attempted solutions\r\nmay not indirectly furnish help in appraising and judging the conditions\r\nof the past. Now it so happens that in the case of agriculture recent\r\nevents in Russia possess very marked significance, and it is therefore\r\nhardly possible to leave them unnoticed here.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be established[1821] beyond reasonable doubt that the genuine\r\nand effective doctrine of Leninite Bolshevism, in its definition of the\r\n‘working class,’ excludes the peasantry. They are not ‘proletarian.’\r\nThat is, the great majority of peasants have something. This each wants\r\nto keep, and if possible to augment. In short, they are Individualists.\r\nNow Bolshevism builds on dogmas of Marxian Socialism, however much it\r\nmay warp their application, however widely it may depart from Marxian\r\ntheory in its choice of methods. Therefore it sees in the peasants only\r\na class of petty bourgeoisie with the anti-socialistic instincts of that\r\nhated class, and will spare no effort to exclude them from political\r\npower. It disfranchises employers, even though the work they do is\r\nproductive and useful to society. We need go no further: these principles\r\nof the Bolshevik creed, be it prophetic vision or be it crazy fanaticism\r\nblind to the facts of human nature and devoid of all practical sense of\r\nproportion, are enough for my present purpose. It results from them that\r\nall wage-earning is wrong: no man has the right to employ another man for\r\nhis own purposes: that the relation benefits both employer and employed,\r\neven if true, is a consideration[1822] wholly irrelevant. For it is\r\npromised that the new civilization, recast on the Bolshevik model, will\r\nleave no room for wage-service of one man to another.\r\n\r\nI am not to criticize this scheme of social and economic life, but to\r\nlook at it coolly as an illustrative fact. It is surely a significant\r\nthing that, while slavery and serfdom are now reckoned as virtually\r\nobsolete phenomena of the past, the old distinction, between the man who\r\nworks himself for himself and the man who works for another, is still\r\nbefore us as the vital line of division in labour-questions. Bloodshed\r\nand torture as means of enforcing the dogma may be confined to Russia,\r\nbut the distinction is at the bottom of industrial unrest all over the\r\nworld. Most significant of all is the admission that peasant landholders\r\nare not a ‘proletariate.’ Of course they are not. But to philosophers\r\nand statesmen of antiquity they appeared as an all-important class, not\r\nonly as producers of food but as a solid element of population, promoting\r\nthe stability of state governments. This stability was favourable to\r\ncontinuity of policy and enabled all interests to thrive in peace.\r\nHave the development of machinery and transport in recent times so far\r\naltered the conditions of agriculture that this is no longer the case? In\r\nother words, is the agricultural labourer, the present wage-earner, to\r\nsupersede the peasant landholder as the dominant figure of rustic life?\r\nIs the large-scale farmer to survive only as the impotent figurehead of\r\nrural enterprises? Is a political proletariate competent to regulate\r\nthe conduct of an industry directly dependent on soil climate and\r\nseasons? Wherever man is in immediate contact with forces of nature,\r\nin farm-life as in seafaring, the bodily energies of many can only be\r\neffective through subordination to the mind of one. How far, under the\r\nmodern factory system, where the mill goes on as usual in all weathers,\r\ndirection by wage-earners may be a practicable proposition, I cannot\r\ntell. That such a plan would be a failure on a farm, I have no doubt\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nMy general conclusion then is that the old distinction observable under\r\nGreco-Roman civilization was in itself a sound one. Yet it led to no\r\nlasting and satisfactory solution of agricultural labour-problems.\r\nMany causes no doubt contributed to this failure; but the lack of a\r\nsatisfactory labour-system was probably the greatest. Neither slavery\r\nnor serfdom was capable of meeting the need, and the wage-earning system\r\nnever grew so as efficiently to supersede them. Now, after centuries\r\nof the wage-system, we are uneasily asking ourselves whether modern\r\ncivilization is gravely endangered through the failure of this system\r\nalso. It seems that in agriculture at least there are two possible\r\nalternatives, either a final settlement of the wage-question on a footing\r\nsatisfactory to the labourer, or a return to αὐτουργία. Probably neither\r\nof these will be found to exclude the other or to be equally applicable\r\nto the circumstances of all countries. That communal ownership and\r\nshifting tenure can be revived seems impossible under modern conditions,\r\nwhatever some Socialists may fancy. On the other hand voluntary\r\ncooperation in marketing seems to have a great future before it. Of a\r\nmovement in that direction I have found no traces among the ancients: but\r\nmodern developments in the way of transport may remove many difficulties.\r\nAt any rate it is in such efforts of adaptation and compromise that\r\nexpert agriculturists seem to be looking for help. As to labour, slavery\r\nand serfdom being excluded from modern civilized states, the coming\r\nproblem is how to secure the performance of agricultural work. The\r\nchoice lies between attractive wage-conditions, appealing to individual\r\ninterest, and the Socialist scheme of tasks carried out under official\r\ndirection, assumed to be in the best interests of a whole community. Both\r\nplans offer a substitute for the crude compulsory methods vainly employed\r\nin the ancient world. Which plan is the more suited to the demands of\r\nhuman nature, whether self-disposal or communism is to be the dominant\r\naim and note of society, coming generations must decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nSOME BYZANTINE AUTHORITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo follow up the history of agricultural labour under the so-called\r\nByzantine empire, after the Roman empire had fallen in the West, is\r\nbeyond my scope. Yet there are certain matters on which light is thrown\r\nby surviving documents that it is hardly possible wholly to ignore.\r\nThat the position of the agricultural classes did not follow the same\r\nlines of development in East and West, is in itself a fact worth noting,\r\nthough not surprising. It may be said to run parallel with the general\r\nfate of the two sections of the once Roman world. In the West[1823] the\r\ngrowth of what we call Feudalism and the rise of new nation-states are\r\nthe phenomena that in the course of centuries gradually produced our\r\nmodern Europe. In the East the Empire long preserved its organization,\r\ndeclining in efficiency and power, but rallying again and again, serving\r\nas a bulwark of Christian Europe, and not extinguished finally till 1453.\r\nIt might perhaps have been guessed that the conditions of rustic life\r\nwould undergo some change, for the system of the later Roman colonate\r\nwas already shewing signs of coming failure in the time of Arcadius and\r\nHonorius. The need of some system more favourable to individual energy\r\nand enterprise, more to be trusted for production of food, was surely\r\nnot to be ignored. Food must have been a need of extreme urgency, with\r\narmies constantly engaged in northern or eastern wars, and the mouths of\r\nConstantinople ever hungry at home. After the Saracen conquest of Egypt\r\nin the seventh century, the food-resources on which the government could\r\nrely must have been seriously reduced, and the need greater than ever.\r\nThus we are not to wonder if we find indications of great interest taken\r\nin agriculture, and direct evidence of reversion to a better land-system\r\nthan that of the later Roman colonate.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. GEOPONICA.\r\n\r\nThe curious collection known as =Geoponica=[1824] comes down to us\r\nin a text attributed to the tenth century, which is supposed to be a\r\nbadly-edited version of an earlier work probably of the sixth or early\r\nseventh century. It is in a scrap-book form, consisting of precepts on a\r\nvast number of topics, the matter under each heading being professedly\r\ndrawn from the doctrine of some author or authors whose names are\r\nprefixed. Some of these are Byzantine writers, others of much earlier\r\ndate, including Democritus and Hippocrates, and the Roman Varro. Modern\r\ncritics consider these citations of names untrustworthy, the collector or\r\neditor having dealt very carelessly with the work of his predecessors.\r\nI can only say that an examination of the chapters that are of special\r\ninterest to me fully bears out this censure. I would add that a reference\r\nto the index shews that Cato Columella Pliny (elder) and Palladius are\r\nnever cited, and express my suspicion that the omission of names is\r\nnot always a proof that those authors were disregarded as sources. The\r\ngeneral character of the work is unscientific and feeble, abounding in\r\nquackery and superstition. Technical and dogmatic, it has nevertheless an\r\nair of unreality, perhaps due in part to the later editor, but probably\r\nin part to the original compiler, whose name is given as Cassianus\r\nBassus, a lawyer (σχολαστικός), apparently a Byzantine.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that the cultivation of corn fills but a small\r\nspace in the Geoponica, being evidently quite a subordinate department\r\nof farm-life as there contemplated. Is this an indication that\r\nConstantinople was still drawing plenty of corn from Egypt, and may\r\nwe infer that this feature is due to the original compiler, writing\r\nbefore the loss of that granary-province? I do not venture to answer the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe passages interesting from my point of view occur in the second book,\r\nwhere some reference, scanty and obscure though it be, is made to labour\r\nand labourers. A chapter (2) on the classes of labourers suited for\r\nvarious kinds of work is a good specimen of this unsatisfactory treatise.\r\nIt is labelled Βάρωνος, but we may well hesitate to ascribe the substance\r\nto Varro. The rules given are for the most part quite commonplace, and\r\nI cannot trace them in Varro’s _res rustica_. On the other hand some of\r\nthem correspond to precepts of Columella. Whether this is their real\r\nsource, or whether they are traditional rules handed down carelessly by\r\nprevious compilers, perhaps on even earlier authority, I see no sure\r\nmeans of determining. The doctrine that boys (παῖδες) should be employed\r\nin field-labour (ἐργασία), to watch and learn from their experienced\r\nelders, and the remark that their suppleness fits them better for\r\nstooping jobs (weeding etc.), is new to me. Varro[1825] at least puts the\r\nminimum age for field-hands at 22. Perhaps this doctrine comes from some\r\nlater authority, of a time when the old supply of adult field-hands was\r\nevidently failing.\r\n\r\nAnother chapter, labelled as drawn from Florentinus (? first half of\r\nthird century), deals with the qualifications and duties of the ἐπίτροπος\r\nor οἰκονόμος, the Roman _vilicus_. This chapter (44) is also quite\r\ncommonplace, and can be copiously illustrated out of many authors, from\r\nXenophon and Cato to Columella and Pliny. The exact meaning of one\r\npassage (§ 3) is not clear to me, but its general drift is in agreement\r\nwith the rest. The notable point about the chapter is that it discusses\r\nthe steward and his staff as forming the ordinary establishment of a\r\nfarm. Are we to infer that this system was normal at the time when the\r\ncompiler put together the precepts under this head? Or is this a case of\r\nunintelligent compilation, a mere passing-on of doctrines practically\r\nobsolete by a town-bred writer in his study? I cannot tell. The\r\nconsideration of further details may give some help towards a judgment.\r\n\r\nThe next chapter (45), with the same label, treats of the steward’s diary\r\nand the organization of the hands (ἐργάται). The main doctrine is that\r\nevery day must have its task, and every plan be punctually carried out,\r\nsince one delay upsets the whole course (τὴν τῆς ἐργασίας τάξιν) and\r\nis bad for both crops and land. This again is stale enough, and may be\r\nillustrated from Cato and Columella. The rules for organizing the hands\r\nin groups of suitable size, so as to get a maximum of efficiency with a\r\nminimum of overseers, agree closely with what we find in Columella. Thus\r\nthere is a strong probability that the labour intended is that of slaves.\r\n\r\nIn chapter 46, with same label, the subject is one of scale (περὶ μέτρου\r\nἐργασίας), the expression of several operations in terms of labour-units\r\n(ἐργασίαι, _operae_). This also is an old story, capable of much\r\nillustration from earlier writers. The work contemplated is that of a\r\nvineyard. The way in which the hands (ἐργάται) are referred to is more\r\nsuited to a slave-staff than to wage-earners.\r\n\r\nSo too in chapter 47, with same label. It is περὶ τῆς τῶν γεωργῶν\r\nὑγιείας, enjoining general care of the men’s health and prescribing\r\nremedies for various ailments. It seems taken for granted that the\r\nhands will submit to the treatment imposed. Remembering the traditional\r\ninterest of the master in his slaves’ health, we can hardly doubt that\r\nslaves are meant here.\r\n\r\nChapter 48, labelled as drawn from Didymus (? fourth or fifth century),\r\nis a warning against ill-considered transplantation from better spots\r\nto less wholesome ones. The reverse order is the right one. This rule\r\napplies not only to plants (φυτά) but to farm-workers (γεωργόι) also. The\r\nprinciple can be traced back to earlier writers. It seems assumed that\r\nthe men, like the plants, can be removed at the master’s will. Probably\r\nslaves are meant, and we may recall the objections of Varro and Columella\r\nto risking slave-property in malarious spots.\r\n\r\nChapter 49, labelled Βάρωνος, asserts the necessity of keeping such\r\nartisans as smiths carpenters and potters on the farm or near at hand.\r\nThe tools have to be kept in good order, and visits to the town waste\r\ntime. That this precept comes from Varro I 16 §§ 3, 4, seems more than\r\ndoubtful: reference will shew that the passages differ considerably.\r\n\r\nI would add that the argument prefixed to book III, a farmer’s calendar,\r\nat least in Beckh’s text, gives a list of the months from January to\r\nDecember, attaching to each Roman name the corresponding Egyptian one.\r\nThe editor apparently accepts this double list as genuine. If it be so,\r\nhas the fact any bearing on the relations between Constantinople and\r\nEgypt referred to above?\r\n\r\n\r\nB. THE FARMER’S LAW.\r\n\r\nThe so-called ‘=Farmer’s Law=,’ νόμος γεωργικός, is now assigned by the\r\ncritics to the time of the Iconoclast emperors, say about 740 AD. It is\r\nan official document of limited scope, not a general regulative code\r\ngoverning agricultural conditions in all parts of the eastern empire.\r\nIts text origin arrangement and the bearing of its evidence have been\r\nmuch discussed, and it will suffice here to refer to the articles of Mr\r\nAshburner[1826] on the subject. What concerns me is the position of\r\nfarmers under the Byzantine empire in the eighth century as compared with\r\nthat of the fourth or fifth century _coloni_, and the different lines\r\nof development followed by country life in East and West. Therefore it\r\nis only necessary to consider some of the main features of the picture\r\nrevealed to us by various details of the Farmer’s Law.\r\n\r\nThe first point that strikes a reader is that the serf[1827] _colonus_\r\nhas apparently disappeared. Land is held by free owners, who either\r\nthemselves provide for its cultivation or let it to tenants who take\r\nover that duty. The normal organization is in districts (χωρία) each of\r\nwhich contains a number of landowners, who either farm their own land\r\nor, if short of means (ἄποροι), let it to other better-equipped farmers\r\nof the same district. Thus the transactions are locally limited, and the\r\nchief object of the law is to prevent misdeeds that might prejudicially\r\naffect the prosperity of the local farmers. These are in a sense partners\r\nor commoners (κοινωνοί), the ‘commonalty’ (κοινότης) of the district,\r\nwhich is a taxation-unit with its members jointly liable. The district\r\nseems to be regarded as originally common and then divided into members’\r\nlots, with a part reserved perhaps as common pasture. Redivision is\r\ncontemplated, and the lots seem to belong rather to the family than to\r\nthe individual. To judge from the tone of the rules, it seems certain\r\nthat the farmers and their families are a class working with their own\r\nhands. But there are also wage-earning labourers, and slaves owned or\r\nhired for farm work. Tenancy on shares, like the partiary system in Roman\r\nLaw, appears as an established practice, and in one passage (clause\r\n16) Mr Ashburner detects a farmer employed at a salary, in short a\r\n_mercennarius_.\r\n\r\nThus we find existing what are a kind of village communities, the\r\nlandowning farmers in which are free to let land to each other and\r\nalso to exchange farms if they see fit to do so. How far they are free\r\nto flit from one commune to another remains doubtful. And there is no\r\nindication that they are at liberty to dispose of their own land-rights\r\nto outsiders. There appears however side by side with these communal\r\nunits another system of tenancies in which individual farmers hire land\r\nfrom great landlords. Naturally the position of such tenants is different\r\nfrom that of tenants under communal owners: the matter is treated at some\r\nlength by Mr Ashburner. What proportion the corn crop generally bore to\r\nother produce in the agriculture of the Byzantine empire contemplated by\r\nthese regulations, the document does not enable us to judge. Vineyards\r\nand figyards were clearly an important department, and also gardens for\r\nvegetables and fruit. Live stock, and damage done to them and by them,\r\nare the subject of many clauses, nor is woodland forgotten. But the olive\r\ndoes not appear. So far as one may guess, the farming was probably of a\r\nmixed character. The penalties assigned for offences are often barbarous,\r\nincluding not only death by hanging or burning but blinding and other\r\nmutilations of oriental use. At the same time the ecclesiastical spirit\r\nof the Eastern empire finds expression in the bestowal of a curse on one\r\nguilty of cheating, referring I suppose primarily to undiscovered fraud.\r\n\r\nThe state of things inferred from the provisions of the ‘Farmer’s Law’\r\nis so remarkable in itself, and so different from the course of rustic\r\ndevelopment in the West, that we are driven to seek an explanation of\r\nsome kind. Many influences may have contributed to produce so striking\r\na differentiation. But one can hardly help suspecting that there was\r\nsome one great influence at work in the eastern empire, to which the\r\nsurprising change noted above was mainly due. In his _History of the\r\nlater Roman Empire_[1828] Professor Bury has offered a conjectural\r\nsolution of the problem. It is to be sought in the changes brought\r\nabout in the national character and the external history of the Empire.\r\nSince the middle of the sixth century north-west Asia Minor and the\r\nBalkan country had been filled with Slavonic settlers, and other parts\r\nwith other new colonists. Now the new settlers, particularly the Slavs,\r\nwere not used to the colonate system or the rigid bond of hereditary\r\noccupations, and emperors busied in imperial defence on the North and\r\nEast knew better than to force upon them an unwelcome system. Invasions\r\nhad reduced the populations of frontier provinces and shattered the old\r\nstate of serfdom. Resettlement on a large scale had to be carried out\r\nwithin the empire, and under new conditions to suit the changed character\r\nof the population. Among the new elements that produced this change the\r\nmost important was the coming of the Slavs.\r\n\r\nFor the Slavs had themselves no institution corresponding to the German\r\n_laeti_. Slaves indeed they had, but not free cultivators attached to\r\nthe soil. Therefore they could not, like the Germans in the West, adapt\r\nthemselves to the Roman colonate; accordingly their intrusion led to\r\nits abolition. In support of this view the well-known Slavonic peasant\r\ncommunities are cited as evidence. Nor can it be denied that this\r\nconsideration has some weight. But, while we may provisionally accept the\r\nconclusion that Slavonic influences had something, perhaps much, to do\r\nwith the new turn given to the conditions of rustic life in the East, we\r\nmust not press it so far as to infer that the colonate-system was extinct\r\nthere. In no case could the ‘Farmer’s Law’ fairly be used to prove\r\nthe negative: and moreover it is apparently the case according to Mr\r\nAshburner that the document is not a complete agricultural code for all\r\nagricultural classes within the empire. If it is ‘concerned exclusively\r\nwith a village community, composed of farmers who cultivate their own\r\nlands,’ it cannot prove the non-existence of other rustic conditions\r\ndifferent in kind. Colonate seems to have disappeared, while slavery\r\nhas not. But that is the utmost we can say. The slave at least is still\r\nthere. As to the important question, whether the farmers contemplated in\r\nthe Law enjoy a real freedom of movement, as has been thought, it is best\r\nto refer a reader to the cautious reserve of Mr Ashburner.\r\n\r\nThe one general inference that I venture to draw from these two\r\nauthorities is that, however much or little the conditions of agriculture\r\nmay have changed in the surviving Eastern part of the Roman empire, the\r\nemployment of slave labour still remained.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. EXTRACTS FROM MODERN BOOKS.\r\n\r\n(1) =Hume=, Essay XI, _Of the populousness of antient nations_.\r\n\r\nWe must now consider what disadvantages the antients lay under with\r\nregard to populousness, and what checks they received from their\r\npolitical maxims and institutions. There are commonly compensations\r\nin every human condition; and tho’ these compensations be not always\r\nperfectly equal, yet they serve, at least, to restrain the prevailing\r\nprinciple. To compare them and estimate their influence, is indeed\r\nvery difficult, even where they take place in the same age, and in\r\nneighbouring countries: But where several ages have intervened, and only\r\nscattered lights are afforded us by antient authors; what can we do but\r\namuse ourselves by talking, _pro_ and _con_, on an interesting subject,\r\nand thereby correcting all hasty and violent determinations?\r\n\r\nMODERN ITALIAN CONDITIONS.\r\n\r\n(2) =Bolton King and Thomas Okey=, _Italy today_.\r\n\r\nIn _Italy today_, Messrs =Bolton King and Thomas Okey= furnish a most\r\ninteresting collection of facts relative to Italian rural conditions.\r\nThe extent to which the phenomena of antiquity reappear in the details\r\nof this careful treatise is most striking. Italy being the central land\r\nof my inquiry, and convinced as I am that the great variety of local\r\nconditions is even now not sufficiently recognized in Roman Histories,\r\nthis excellent book is of peculiar value. In the course of (say) fifteen\r\ncenturies Italy and her people have passed through strange vicissitudes,\r\nnot merely political: a great change has taken place in the range of\r\nagricultural products: yet old phenomena of rural life meet the inquirer\r\nat every turn. Surely this cannot be dismissed lightly as a casual\r\ncoincidence. I cannot find room to set out the resemblances in detail,\r\nso I append a short table of reference to passages in the book that have\r\nimpressed me most. Supplementary to this, as a vivid illustration of\r\nconditions in a mountain district, the first three chapters of _In the\r\nAbruzzi_, by =Anne Macdonell=, are decidedly helpful. For instance, it\r\nappears that the old migratory pasturage still existed in full force down\r\nto quite recent times, but the late conversion of much Apulian lowland\r\nfrom pasture to tillage has seriously affected the position of the\r\nhighland shepherds by reducing the area available for winter grazing. The\r\nchapter on brigandage has also some instructive passages.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES TO _Italy today_.\r\n\r\nPeasant contrasted with wage-earner, pp 64-6, 72, 74, 126, 166-8,\r\n171-2, 175-6, 200, 312, and Index under _mezzaiuoli_ and _peasants_.\r\nAgricultural classes, pp 164-6.

That is, if property changed hands during the continuance\r\nof the lease, the new owner might evict the tenant.

LIST OF SOME BOOKS USED.\r\n\r\nThis list does not pretend to be complete. Many other works are referred\r\nto here and there in the notes on the text. But I feel bound to mention\r\nthe names of some, particularly those dealing with conditions that did\r\nor still do exist in the modern world. Miscellaneous reading of this\r\nkind has been to me a great help in the endeavour to understand the full\r\nbearing of ancient evidence, and (I hope) to judge it fairly. It is on\r\nthe presentation and criticism of that evidence that I depend: for the\r\ngreat handbooks of Antiquities do not help me much. The practice of\r\nmaking a statement and giving in support of it a reference or references\r\nis on the face of it sound. But, when the witnesses cited are authors\r\nwriting under widely various conditions of time and place and personal\r\ncircumstances, it is necessary whenever possible to appraise each one\r\nseparately. And when the aim is, not to write a technical treatise on\r\n‘scientific’ lines, but to describe what is a highly important background\r\nof a great civilization, a separate treatment of witnesses needs no\r\napology. I cannot cite in detail the references to conditions in a number\r\nof countries, for instance India and China, but I have given them by page\r\nor chapter so as to be consulted with ease.\r\n\r\n(1) AGRICULTURE AND RUSTIC LIFE AND LABOUR.\r\n\r\n    M Weber, _Die Römische Agrargeschichte_, Stuttgart 1891.\r\n\r\n    C Daubeny, _Lectures on Roman husbandry_, Oxford 1857.\r\n\r\n    Ll Storr-Best, _Varro on farming_, translated with Introduction\r\n    commentary and excursus, London 1912.\r\n\r\n    E de Laveleye, _Primitive Property_, English translation 1878.\r\n\r\n    H Blümner, article ‘Landwirtschaft’ in I Müller’s _Handbuch_ VI\r\n    ii 2, ed 3 pp 533 foll.\r\n\r\n    A E Zimmern, _The Greek Commonwealth_, Oxford 1911.\r\n\r\n    Büchsenschütz, _Besitz und Erwerb_, Halle 1869.\r\n\r\n    _Columella of Husbandry_, translation (anonymous), London 1745.\r\n\r\n(2) ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL MATTERS.\r\n\r\n    Adam Smith, _Wealth of Nations_, _passim_.\r\n\r\n    H Nissen, _Italische Landeskunde_, Berlin 1883-1902.\r\n\r\n    K W Nitzsch, _Geschichte der Römischen Republik_, vol II,\r\n    Leipzig 1885.\r\n\r\n    L Bloch, _Soziale Kämpfe im alten Röm_, ed III Berlin 1913.\r\n\r\n    David Hume, _Essays_, ed 1760 (Essay XI of the populousness of\r\n    antient nations).\r\n\r\n    J Beloch, _Die Bevölkerung der Griechisch-Römischen Welt_,\r\n    Leipzig 1886.\r\n\r\n    H Francotte, _L’Industrie dans la Grèce ancienne_, Bruxelles\r\n    1900-1.\r\n\r\n    O Seeck, _Geschichte des Untergangs der antiken Welt_, Berlin\r\n    1897-1913.\r\n\r\n    O Seeck, ‘Die Schatzungsordnung Diocletians,’ in _Zeitschrift\r\n    für Social- und Wirthschaftsgeschichte_, Weimar 1896.\r\n\r\n    H Schiller, _Geschichte der Römischen Kaiserzeit_, Gotha 1883-7.\r\n\r\n    S Dill, _Roman society in the last century of the Western\r\n    Empire_, London 1898.\r\n\r\n    G Gilbert, _Handbuch der Griechischen Staatsalterthümer_, vol\r\n    II, Leipzig 1885.\r\n\r\n(3) LAW AND THE LATER COLONATE.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the books named under other heads deal with legal points, for\r\ninstance Beauchet, Lipsius, Meier and Schömann, Calderini, M Clerc.\r\n\r\nThe Digest and Codex Justinianus have been used in the text of Mommsen\r\nand P Krüger.\r\n\r\n    _The Codex Theodosianus_ in text of Mommsen and P M Meyer,\r\n    Berlin 1905 and in Ritter’s edition of Godefroi, Leipzig\r\n    1736-45.\r\n\r\n    P Girard, _Textes de droit Romain_, ed 4 Paris 1913.\r\n\r\n    F Zulueta, ‘De Patrociniis vicorum,’ in Vinogradoff’s _Oxford\r\n    Studies_, Oxford 1909.\r\n\r\n    M Rostowzew, _Studien zur Geschichte des Römischen Colonates_,\r\n    Leipzig and Berlin 1910.\r\n\r\n    B Heisterbergk, _Die Entstehung des Colonats_, Leipzig 1876.\r\n\r\n    A Esmein, _Mélanges d’histoire du Droit_, Paris 1886.\r\n\r\n    Fustel de Coulanges, ‘Le Colonat Romain,’ in his _Recherches\r\n    sur quelques problèmes d’histoire_, Paris 1885.\r\n\r\n    H F Pelham, _Essays_ (No XIII), Oxford 1911.\r\n\r\nI am sorry that inability to procure copies has prevented me from\r\nconsulting the following works:\r\n\r\n    Beaudouin, _Les grands domaines dans l’empire Romain_, Paris\r\n    1899.\r\n\r\n    Bolkestein, _de colonatu Romano eiusque origine_, Amsterdam\r\n    1906.\r\n\r\n(4) MANUMISSION AND KINDRED TOPICS.\r\n\r\n    A Calderini, _La manomissione e la condizione dei liberti in\r\n    Grecia_, Milan 1908.\r\n\r\n    M Clerc, _Les métèques Athéniens_, Paris 1893.\r\n\r\n    L Beauchet, _Droit privé de la République Athénienne_, Paris\r\n    1897.\r\n\r\n    J H Lipsius, _Das Attische Recht etc._, Leipzig 1905.\r\n\r\n    Meier und Schömann, _Der Attische Process_, Berlin 1883-7.\r\n\r\n    Mommsen, _Römisches Staatsrecht_.\r\n\r\n    G Haenel, _Corpus legum_, Leipzig 1857.\r\n\r\n    C G Bruns, _Fontes Iuris Romani antiqui_.\r\n\r\n    Dareste, Haussoullier, Th Reinach, _Recueil des inscriptions\r\n    juridiques Grecques_, Paris 1904.

But the account given in this passage of the\r\nspread of _latifundia_ and slave-gangs is too loose to be of much value.\r\nIn particular, the assertion that slave-breeding was already common and\r\nlucrative is not to be believed.

The rise in the census numbers between 131 and 125\r\nBC is explained by Greenidge _History_ p 150 as due to the increase of\r\n_adsidui_ through effect of Gracchan legislation.\r\n\r\n[624] See Greenidge _History_ pp 60-1, 424-5.\r\n\r\n[625] See Cato’s opinion cited by Cic _de off_ II § 89, Columella VI\r\n_praef_ §§ 3-5, Plin _NH_ XVIII §§ 29, 30.\r\n\r\n[626] Cic _in Catil_ II § 18.\r\n\r\n[627] Cic _in Catil_ II § 20, cf _de lege agr_ II § 78 _fundos quorum\r\nsubsidio familiarum magnitudines sustentare possint_.\r\n\r\n[628] _familiis magnis._\r\n\r\n[629] Livy VI 12 § 5, cf VII 25 § 8.\r\n\r\n[630] Cairnes _The Slave Power_ ch III.

In Terence\r\n_Hautont_ 142-4 the Old Man, on taking to farming, sells off all his\r\nhousehold slaves save such as are able to pay for their keep _opere\r\nrustico faciundo_. His motive for giving up domestic comfort and taking\r\nto hard manual labour on the land is to punish himself.

In Varro III 2 § 5 we find _fundo ... polito\r\ncultura_. See Nonius p 66 M for _politiones = agrorum cultus diligentes_.\r\nGreenidge _hist_ p 79 regards the _politores_ as métayer tenants, why, I\r\ndo not know.\r\n\r\n[704] Ibid 7 § 2, 21 § 5.\r\n\r\n[705] Ibid 5, especially § 4 _operarium, mercennarium, politorem diutius\r\neundem ne habeat die_. This is taken by Wallon II pp 100, 345, to mean\r\nthat these hired men are to be paid off at the end of their stipulated\r\nterm. Keil thinks they are to be dischargeable at a day’s notice.\r\n_eundem_ seems to imply that it was convenient to change your hired men\r\noften.\r\n\r\n[706] Ibid 2 § 2, and § 4 _viam publicam muniri_.\r\n\r\n[707] The account given in Greenidge’s _History of Rome_ deserves special\r\nreference here. On pp 266-7 he well points out that it was not the\r\nGracchan aim to revive the free labourer but the peasant proprietor.\r\n\r\n[708] This is known from the _lex agraria_ of which a large part is\r\npreserved. See text in Bruns’ _Fontes_ or Wordsworth’s _Specimens_.\r\nTranslated and explained in Dr E G Hardy’s _Six Roman Laws_.\r\n\r\n[709] Perhaps some inference may be drawn from Sallust _Iug_ 73 § 6\r\n_plebes sic accensa uti opifices agrestesque omnes, quorum res fidesque\r\nin manibus sitae erant, relictis operibus frequentarent Marium_ ... etc,\r\nthough this refers directly to political support, not to the recruiting\r\nof troops.\r\n\r\n[710] See the important paper by Dr E G Hardy _Journ Phil_ 1913.\r\n\r\n[711] _Monum Ancyr_ III 22 [cap XVI].\r\n\r\n[712] Varro _RR_ I 2 §§ 3, 6.

Cf Horace _epodes_ IV.\r\n\r\n[816] See Rostowzew, _Röm Colonat_, for detailed inquiry into Eastern\r\nphenomena, Egyptian in particular. For the case of China see reference\r\nto Macgowan [Appendix D 6]. A very interesting account of the system in\r\nHindustan in the 17th century, with criticism of its grave abuses, may\r\nbe found in the _Travels in the Mogul empire_ by François Bernier, ed 2\r\nby V A Smith, Oxford 1914, pages 226-38. I believe the legal phrase is\r\n‘Eminent Domain.’\r\n\r\n[817] In Greenidge, _History_ pp 292-3, there are some good remarks on\r\nthe process.\r\n\r\n[818] Frontinus grom I p 35, Columella III 3 § 11, and Heisterbergk’s\r\nremarks cited below. See Index, _Italian land and taxation_.\r\n\r\n[819] Tacitus _ann_ II 59 _seposuit Aegyptum hist_ I 11 _domi retinere_.\r\nThis need not be taken to mean that he treated it strictly as part of his\r\nprivate estate, as Mommsen thought. See on the controversy a note of E\r\nMeyer _Kl Schr_ p 479.\r\n\r\n[820] See M Weber _Agrargeschichte_ pp 243 foll.\r\n\r\n[821] The estates of Atticus in Epirus are a leading case of this.\r\nHorace _epist_ I 12 refers to those of Agrippa in Sicily. Such cases\r\nhave nothing to do with emigration of working farmers, in which I do not\r\nbelieve. Surely Greenidge _History_ p 270 is right in saying that the\r\nGracchan scheme of colonization was commercial rather than agricultural.\r\nAlso the municipalities, beside their estates in Italy, held lands in\r\nthe Provinces. See Tyrrell and Purser on Cic _ad fam_ XIII 7 and 11. In\r\ngeneral, Seneca _epist_ 87 § 7, 89 § 20, Florus II 7 § 3.\r\n\r\n[822] We may perhaps carry this back into the time of the Republic. See\r\nthe references to the royal domains of Macedon, Livy XLV 18 § 3, and with\r\nothers Cic _de lege agr_ II § 50.\r\n\r\n[823] See the chapter on the African inscriptions.\r\n\r\n[824] For the cases of India and China see references to Sir A Fraser and\r\nMacgowan [Appendix D 6].\r\n\r\n[825] Tacitus _ann_ XIV 27 records the failure of Nero’s colonization\r\nof veterans singly in Italy, who mostly returned to the scenes of their\r\nservice. He strangely regrets the abandonment of the old plan of settling\r\nthem in whole legions. It is to be remembered that in the later Empire\r\nthe army was more and more recruited from the barbarians.\r\n\r\n[826] The γῆ κληρουχική, assigned in κλῆροι to soldiers.\r\n\r\n[827] See Herodotus II 165-7, cf 141, Strabo XV 1 § 40 (p 704), § 34 (p\r\n701), § 54 (p 710), cf Diodorus II 40-1, Arrian _Indica_ 10 §§ 8, 9. The\r\nreferences to slave-traffic in the _Periplus maris Erythraei_ do not\r\nreally imply existence of a slave-system in India. See Rapson _Ancient\r\nIndia_ p 97. Much of interest in Sir J D Rees, _The real India_, on\r\nthe Land-system etc. In _The early history of India_ by V A Smith the\r\nexistence of slavery in India is maintained.\r\n\r\n[828] See Dionysius II 28, cf 8, 9.\r\n\r\n[829] The _operae_ referred to in the African inscriptions.\r\n\r\n[830] It is possible to see a beginning of this system in the\r\ntenancy-on-shares (the _colonia partiaria_) which we find not only in\r\nItaly but in Africa as a recognized plan.\r\n\r\n[831] This is the view of Rostowzew _Röm Colonat_ p 397.\r\n\r\n[832] Hor _Sat_ II 7 23, _Epist_ II 1 139-40.\r\n\r\n[833] Hor _Odes_ I 12.\r\n\r\n[834] _Odes_ II 15, 18, _Sat_ II 6 6-15.\r\n\r\n[835] _Odes_ III 6.\r\n\r\n[836] _Odes_ III 5. See above pp 139-40.\r\n\r\n[837] _Odes_ III 1 _redemptor cum famulis_.\r\n\r\n[838] _Odes_ II 3, _Epist_ II 2 177-8.\r\n\r\n[839] _Odes_ I 1, II 16, III 16.\r\n\r\n[840] _Odes_ I 1 _patrios ... agros_, Epode II 3 _paterna rura bobus\r\nexercet suis_.\r\n\r\n[841] _Epode_ IV 13 _arat Falerni mille fundi iugera_, etc.\r\n\r\n[842] _Odes_ III 16 _quicquid arat impiger Apulus_.\r\n\r\n[843] _Epode_ II 39 foll.\r\n\r\n[844] A fact recognized by Horace himself in lines 14-16 of _Odes_ III 4,\r\nand _Sat_ I 5 lines 77 foll.\r\n\r\n[845] _Odes_ I 35 _pauper ... ruris colonus_, II 14 _inopes coloni_.\r\n_Sat_ II 2 115, where the fact of expulsion in favour of a military\r\npensioner is judiciously ignored. See below.\r\n\r\n[846] These _coloni_ of course owned their farms; that is, were _domini_.\r\n_Odes_ III 4 lines 37-8, _Sat_ II 6 55-6.\r\n\r\n[847] _Odes_ I 1 _mercator ... indocilis pauperiem pati_, cf III 2.\r\n\r\n[848] So Cicero’s estate at Arpinum is spoken of _ad Att_ XIII 9 § 2 as\r\n_praediola_ and was perhaps let in the same way.\r\n\r\n[849] Cf Seneca _epist_ 47 § 14, 86 § 14.\r\n\r\n[850] The ownership of the slaves is another matter, for in letting farms\r\nthe _dominus_ often supplied the slaves. See Index, _instrumentum_.\r\n\r\n[851] I find that Mr Warde Fowler, _The death of Turnus_ p 105, also\r\ntakes this view. But he understands _pater_ to imply that the man brought\r\nup a family, which I do not. I agree that it gives the idea of headship\r\nof a household.\r\n\r\n[852] _Italische Landeskunde_ II p 615.\r\n\r\n[853] The description of such an _agellus_ in Plin _epist_ I 24\r\nillustrates the wants of a literary landowner excellently.\r\n\r\n[854] Tibullus II 1 51 _agricola adsiduo ... satiatus aratro_.\r\n\r\n[855] Tibullus II 6 25-6.\r\n\r\n[856] Ovid _fasti_ I 207, III 779-82, IV 693-4.\r\n\r\n[857] Ovid _metam_ I 135-6, Manilius I 73-4.\r\n\r\n[858] Vitruvius II 1.\r\n\r\n[859] I cannot accept Prof. Richmond’s view (Inaugural lecture 1919 p 25)\r\nof the _Georgics_ as ‘concerned with every side of husbandry.’\r\n\r\n[860] Whether Vergil suffered two expulsions, and what is the\r\nchronological order of eclogues I and IX, are questions that do not\r\naffect my inquiry.\r\n\r\n[861] Pliny _epist_ III 10 § 7.\r\n\r\n[862] _Aen_ VII 641-817, IX 603-13.\r\n\r\n[863] e.g. _Aen_ VI 613.\r\n\r\n[864] Ellis on Catullus XXIII 1.\r\n\r\n[865] See page 217.\r\n\r\n[866] Sueton _Vespas_ I.\r\n\r\n[867] Keightley includes Mago, whether rightly or not I am not sure.\r\nConington’s Introduction treats this matter fully.\r\n\r\n[868] The futility of addressing rustic readers in polished literary\r\nlanguage (_diserte_) is commented on by Palladius [4th cent AD] in his\r\nopening sentences. He has been thought to have in view Columella, who by\r\nthe by is Vergil’s great admirer. I cannot accept the views of Daubeny in\r\nhis _Lectures_ pp 3-5. It is possible that the use of fire in improving\r\nland may be a bit of Vergil’s own advice, but I doubt it. See Daubeny pp\r\n91-4, _georg_ I 84 foll.\r\n\r\n[869] E Meyer _Kl Schr_ p 488 describing the hopeless task of Augustus in\r\nattempting the moral and physical regeneration of Italy makes the general\r\nremark ‘Nur an die höheren Stände, nur an die Elite, konnte Augustus sich\r\nwenden.’ This is a true picture of the situation as a whole. To have to\r\nbegin building at the top was fatal.\r\n\r\n[870] Most clearly stated in Columella I 7.\r\n\r\n[871] For _coloni_ of Cicero’s time see II _in Verr_ III § 55, _pro\r\nCaecina_ § 94, _pro Cluent_ §§ 175, 182. The references in Horace are\r\ngiven below. That letting to tenants was practised about 100 BC or\r\nearlier, appears certain from the reference to Saserna’s opinion on this\r\npolicy in Columella I 7 § 4.\r\n\r\n[872] Velleius II 88, and many passages in Seneca and other authors.\r\n\r\n[873] Dion Cass LII 27-8.\r\n\r\n[874] Compare Suet _Aug_ 41 for the Emperor’s actual policy. It seems\r\nthat the influx of specie captured at Alexandria sent the rate of\r\ninterest down and the price of land up.\r\n\r\n[875] This is admirably dealt with in Sellar’s _Virgil_, and need not be\r\nreproduced here.\r\n\r\n[876] Mr T R Glover, _Virgil_ p 14, reminds us that the poet’s father is\r\nsaid to have done some business in timber at one time.\r\n\r\n[877] When Cicero _de orat_ III § 46 credits _messores_ with a rustic\r\nbrogue he can hardly be thinking of foreign slaves.\r\n\r\n[878] As in Lucan VII 402 _vincto fossore_.\r\n\r\n[879] Varro _RR_ II 10.\r\n\r\n[880] See Varro _RR_ II 2 § 20, 5 § 18, 7 § 16, even for treatment of\r\n_homines_ 10 § 10. Written books of prescriptions were provided.\r\n\r\n[881] _Georg_ III 515-30.\r\n\r\n[882] _tristis_ suggests the owner. A slave was not likely to care.\r\n\r\n[883] In Sellar’s _Virgil_ chapter VI § 5 there is an excellent treatment\r\nof this episode, with a discussion of V’s relation to Lucretius and a\r\nmost apposite quotation from G Sand.\r\n\r\n[884] Varro II 5 § 4, Columella VI _praef_ § 7, Plin _NH_ VIII § 180.\r\n\r\n[885] The _molle atque facetum_ attributed to V by Horace is I think\r\nrightly explained by Quintilian VI 3 § 20, and amounts to easy and\r\nfastidious taste, of course the result of careful revision, his practice\r\nof which is attested in the Suetonian biography.\r\n\r\n[886] So Tibullus II 1 41-2.\r\n\r\n[887] Cf Cic _de off_ I §§ 41, 150, passages in which the growth of the\r\ntechnical sense is seen.\r\n\r\n[888] See the interesting story of the bee-farm in Varro _RR_ III 16 §§\r\n10, 11.\r\n\r\n[889] Pliny _NH_ XIX §§ 50-1.\r\n\r\n[890] II 412-3 _laudato ingentia rura, exiguum colito_. Not found in\r\nsurviving text of Cato.\r\n\r\n[891] II 532.\r\n\r\n[892] I 125-8, II 336-42.\r\n\r\n[893] II 136-76.\r\n\r\n[894] Dionys _Hal_ I 36-7, Strabo VI 4 § 1, p 286, Varro _RR_ I 2 §§ 1-7.\r\n\r\n[895] Horace _Odes_ IV 5, 15, published about 14 BC. So Martial V 4\r\ndeclares that Domitian has made Rome _pudica_.\r\n\r\n[896] Sueton _Aug_ 32 (cf _Tib_ 8), and the elder Seneca _contr_ X 4\r\n§ 18. Even in the second century AD, Spart _Hadr_ 18 § 9 _ergastula\r\nservorum et liberorum tulit_. Perhaps the _ergastula_ in Columella I 3 §\r\n12 refer to the same practice.\r\n\r\n[897] H Blümner in Müller’s _Handbuch_ IV 2 2 p 543 says that Varro\r\ndoes not refer to the _Kolonat als Pacht_. But that sense seems clearly\r\nimplied in I 2 § 17, II 3 § 4 _in lege locationis fundi_. In I 16 § 4 it\r\nsurely includes tenants, even if the application is more general. In II\r\n_praef_ § 5 _colonus_ is simply = _arator_, opposed to _pastor_.\r\n\r\n[898] Columella I 7.\r\n\r\n[899] Pliny _epist_ III 19, IX 37.\r\n\r\n[900] This reminds us of Varro’s words, speaking (I 17 § 2) of free\r\nworkers ... _cum ipsi colunt, ut plerique pauperculi cum sua progenie_.\r\n\r\n[901] Cf Tibullus II 1 23 _turbaque vernarum saturi bona signa coloni_.\r\n\r\n[902] See above, p 216.\r\n\r\n[903] Hor _epist_ I 14 39, cf II 2 184-6.\r\n\r\n[904] Hor _Sat_ I 3 99 foll, where _animalia_ seems to mean little more\r\nthan _homines_.\r\n\r\n[905] Hor _Sat_ II 6 55-6, _Odes_ III 4 37-40.\r\n\r\n[906] The one reference to the assignations [_G_ II 198] only speaks of\r\nthe misfortune of Mantua, not of his own.\r\n\r\n[907] Hor _Epist_ I 16 69-72.\r\n\r\n[908] Hor _Sat_ I 1 28, 32.\r\n\r\n[909] For the story of the φιάλη (freedman’s offering) sent yearly\r\nby Maecenas to Augustus as a recognition of his restoration of Roman\r\nfreedom, see Gardthausen _Augustus_ VII 7 and notes.\r\n\r\n[910] _Monum Ancyr_ ed Mommsen, I 16-9, III 22-8.\r\n\r\n[911] Tacitus _ann_ XIV 53.\r\n\r\n[912] Gardthausen _Augustus_ VII 7, pp 768-9.

It seems that they farmed either at their own risk or for\r\nowner’s account [_fide dominica_]. In the former case they could have a\r\ntenant’s agreement like the free _coloni_. In the latter they were only\r\n_vilici_ and therefore part of the _instrumentum_. Here I think we may\r\nsee beginnings of the unfree colonate. But Mommsen does not touch the\r\npoint of manumission. It seems to me that an agreement with a slave must\r\nat first have been revocable at the pleasure of the _dominus_, and its\r\ngrowth into a binding lease was probably connected in many instances with\r\nmanumission.\r\n\r\n[1242] I 55 _hoc petit, esse sui nec magni ruris arator, sordidaque in\r\nparvis otia rebus amat_.

De Coulanges pp\r\n75-85 urges that the system already described by Ulpian in Dig L 15 §§ 3,\r\n4, is much the same, and points out that monastic records shew it still\r\nsurviving in the early Middle Age.

After all, the Codes do not give one a favourable picture of the\r\nlater colonate, and the Empire did fall in the West.\r\n\r\n[1753] This arrangement was especially frequent in the East.

The limiting word\r\n_paene_ may refer to difference in mode of payment of taxes. These laws,\r\nretained in cod Just, date from 400.\r\n\r\n[1793] Seeck just cited. Weber, _Agrargeschichte_ p 257.\r\n\r\n[1794] E Meyer _Kl Schr_ p 185 takes the words of Aristotle _Pol_ I 2\r\n§ 5 ὁ γὰρ βοῦς ἀντ’ οἰκέτου τοῖς πένησίν ἐστιν as proving that even in\r\nAr’s time the small farmer had to do without a slave. I think they prove\r\nthat if he could not afford a slave he must do with an ox only. For the\r\nadditional protection of the ox see Index. Cf Maine, _Early Law and\r\nCustom_ pp 249-51.\r\n\r\n[1795] E Meyer _Kl Schriften_ p 179 will only use the word _slaves_ of a\r\npart of these, but the distinction does not matter here.\r\n\r\n[1796] See Dig XXXII § 99 (Paulus), and XXXIII 7 _passim_, especially §\r\n25¹.\r\n\r\n[1797] That religious scruple was opposed to keeping members of the same\r\nrace-unit in slavery is most probable. This _trans Tiberim_ rule is known\r\nfrom Gellius XX 1 § 47, referring to debt-slaves. Greeks however, even\r\nwhen abhorring the enslavement of Greek by Greek in principle, did not\r\ndiscontinue the practice. E Meyer _Kl Schr_ p 202 compares the medieval\r\nscruple in reference to brother Christians. See also his remarks p 177.\r\nFor Hebrew law and custom see _Encyclopaedia Biblica_ (1903) vol IV and\r\nHastings’ _Dictionary of the Bible_ (1902) vol IV, articles _Slavery_.\r\n\r\n[1798] Different also from the position of a food-producer class in a\r\ngreat territorial state, being based on local conditions.\r\n\r\n[1799] Illustrated with great clearness in the provisions of the Gortyn\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\n[1800] Varro _RR_ I 17 § 2 on _obaerarii_ or _obaerati_.\r\n\r\n[1801] The relative importance of land and the means of cultivation\r\n[especially oxen] in early times, the power thus gained by chiefs\r\ngranting cattle to tenants, and the connexion of these phenomena with\r\nlegends of debt-slavery, are instructively discussed in Maine’s _Early\r\nhistory of Institutions_, lecture VI.\r\n\r\n[1802] Mr G G Coulton kindly reminds me of an analogy observable in the\r\nhistory of Art. It is progressive on simple lines up to a certain point.\r\nThen it begins to ramify, and differences of taste become more acute.\r\nHence an anarchy of taste, driving men to yearn (like Ruskin, Morris,\r\netc.) for the old simplicity. So the peasant up to a point is useful and\r\nnoble. But fresh currents of civilization alter his position. Then men\r\nyearn for the old simplicity, only defective through being essentially\r\nsimple.\r\n\r\n[1803] Mr Zimmern, _The Greek Commonwealth_ pp 265 foll, has some\r\ninteresting remarks on craftsmen as wage-earners, and points out their\r\npreference for serving the state rather than private employers. The\r\nlatter plan would have put them almost in the position of slaves.\r\n\r\n[1804] When food was provided, we must reckon it as part of his wage.\r\n\r\n[1805] A vast number of Greek records of manumission refer to such cases.\r\n\r\n[1806] See Francotte, _L’Industrie dans la Grèce ancienne_ book II\r\nchap 5, _La concurrence servile_. I cannot follow E Meyer _Kl Schr_ pp\r\n198-201. And the oft-cited passage of Timaeus (Athen VI 264 d), where\r\nfree Phocians object to slaves taking their employment, refers solely to\r\ndomestic and personal attendance.\r\n\r\n[1807] Of this there is abundant American evidence from writers on\r\nSlavery. The hired slave sometimes got a higher wage than the hired\r\nfreeman.\r\n\r\n[1808] See Whitaker’s Almanack, and the exposure of an impudent agency\r\nfor the purpose in the _Times_ 15 Sept 1914.\r\n\r\n[1809] Compare Wendell Phillips ‘Before this there had been among us\r\nscattered and single abolitionists, earnest and able men; sometimes, like\r\nWythe of Virginia, in high places. The Quakers and Covenanters had never\r\nintermitted their testimony against slavery. But Garrison was the first\r\nman to begin a _movement_ designed to annihilate slavery.’ Speech at G’s\r\nfuneral 1879.\r\n\r\n[1810] Prof Bury, _Idea of Progress_ p 275, points out that Guizot noted\r\nthat Christianity did not in its early stages aim at any improvement of\r\nsocial conditions.\r\n\r\n[1811] The conclusions reached in this paragraph are in agreement with E\r\nMeyer _Kl Schr_ pp 151-2, 155, 205, 209. But he seems to put the decline\r\nof the slave-gang system rather earlier than I venture to do.\r\n\r\n[1812] We must bear in mind that a tenant was naturally unwilling to work\r\nfor a margin of profit not to be retained by himself. Hence the tendency\r\nto find means of constraining him to do so.\r\n\r\n[1813] _coloni_ or _quasi coloni_, cf Dig XV 3 § 16, XXXIII 8 § 23³, or\r\nXXXIII 7 §§ 12³, 18⁴, 20¹, and numerous other references.\r\n\r\n[1814] The compulsory tenure of municipal offices is commonly cited as\r\nillustrating the pressure even on men of means. It began in the second\r\ncentury. See Dig L 1 § 38⁶, 2 § 1 [Ulpian], 4 § 14⁶ [Callistratus citing\r\nHadrian], and many other passages. Notable is L 4 § 4¹ _honores qui\r\nindicuntur_ [Ulpian].\r\n\r\n[1815] This topic is the subject of Churchill Babington’s Hulsean\r\ndissertation, Cambridge 1846. I learn that a pamphlet by Brecht,\r\n_Sklaverei und Christentum_, takes a less favourable view, but have not\r\nseen it. The survival of the colonate and its heavy burdens in the early\r\nMiddle Age are treated by de Coulanges, particularly in connexion with\r\nthe estates of the Church.\r\n\r\n[1816] The slow progress of emancipation is referred to by E Meyer _Kl\r\nSchr_ p 178, of course from a very different point of view. He mentions\r\nthat slavery was not completely forbidden in Prussia till 1857, and is\r\nagainst its abolition in German colonies. Seeley in his _Life of Stein_\r\npoints out that the armies of Frederic the Great were mainly recruited\r\nfrom serfs.\r\n\r\n[1817] The Turk and his Rayahs furnishes a very striking illustration.\r\n\r\n[1818] E Meyer, _Kl Schr_ p 188.\r\n\r\n[1819] Since writing this section I have found in Prof Bury’s _Idea of\r\nProgress_ pp 269-70 a passage which seems to justify the objection here\r\nraised, though it occurs in a different connexion.\r\n\r\n[1820] It is perhaps hardly necessary to refer to the great economic\r\ndisturbance caused by the Black Death in fourteenth century England.\r\n\r\n[1821] John Spargo, _Bolshevism, the enemy of political and industrial\r\nDemocracy_. London, J Murray 1919. I think I may accept the author’s\r\nevidence on the points here referred to, confirmed as it is by other\r\nobservers. See his remarks pp 69, 156, 275, 278, in particular. That the\r\nsame sharp distinction between peasant and wage-earner is drawn by the\r\nSocialists in other countries also, and is to them a stumbling-block, is\r\nclearly to be seen in King and Okey’s _Italy today_.
