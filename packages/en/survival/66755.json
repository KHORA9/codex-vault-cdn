Will\r\nhe have the patience, the skill, the keenness of vision necessary for\r\nwaging successful warfare on the tiniest species, often the most\r\nformidable, when the June-bug, despite its far greater size, baffles\r\nall his endeavors? Will he undertake to examine his fields and inspect\r\nevery lump of soil, every spear of wheat, every separate leaf on his\r\nfruit-trees? For so prodigious a task the whole human race would be\r\ninadequate, even if it united all its efforts to this one end. The\r\ndevouring hordes would reduce us to starvation, my children, had we not\r\nable helpers to work for us, helpers endowed with a patience that\r\nnothing can tire, a skill that foils all ruses, a vigilance that\r\nnothing escapes. To lie in ambush for the enemy, to track it to its\r\nremotest retreats, to hunt it unceasingly, and finally to exterminate\r\nit—that is their sole care, their never-ending occupation. Urged on by\r\nthe pangs of hunger, they are relentless in their pursuit, both for\r\ntheir own sake and on behalf of their progeny. They live on those that\r\nlive on us; they are the enemies of our enemies.\r\n\r\n“Engaged in this work are the martins that just at present are circling\r\nover our heads, the bats that fly around our house, the owls that call\r\nto one another from the hollow willow trunks in the meadow, the\r\nwarblers that sing in the grove, the frogs that croak in the ditches,\r\nand many more besides, including the toad, which is an object of\r\nloathing to most people. Thanks be to God who has given us, to serve as\r\nguardians of our daily bread, the owl and the toad, the bat and the\r\nviper, the frog and the lizard! All these creatures, wrongfully cursed\r\nand shamefully abused by us, and foolishly looked upon with repugnance\r\nand hatred, in reality lend us valiant assistance and should take a\r\nhigh place in our esteem. To repair the injustice they have suffered\r\nshall be my first duty as we come to each of them in turn. Thanks be to\r\nGod who, to protect us from that great eater the insect, has given us\r\nthe swallow and the warbler, the robin redbreast and the nightingale!\r\nThese, the delight of our eye and ear, creatures of infinite grace—must\r\nI again raise my voice in their defense? Alas, yes, for their homes are\r\nravaged by the barbarous nest-hunter.\r\n\r\n“It is my purpose now to acquaint you, my children, with these various\r\nhelpers of man in his labors as tiller of the soil. I will tell you\r\nabout their ways of living, their habits and their aptitudes, and the\r\nservices they render us. My object will be attained if I succeed in\r\nimparting to you a little of the interest they deserve. I will begin\r\nwith those that have teeth. But first let us take a glance at the shape\r\nand structure of teeth in general; for it is this that determines the\r\nkind of food required by the animal.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTEETH\r\n\r\n\r\n“Is it not true,” resumed Uncle Paul, “that each kind of work demands\r\nits own special tool? The plowman must have the plow, the blacksmith\r\nthe anvil, the mason the trowel, the weaver the shuttle, the carpenter\r\nthe plane; and these different tools, all excellent for the work to\r\nwhich they are applied, would be of no use in any other. Could the\r\nmason rough-cast his wall with a shuttle? Could the weaver weave his\r\ncloth with a trowel? Evidently not. Is it not true, then, that from the\r\ntool one may easily guess the kind of work it does?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing could be easier, it seems to me,” replied Jules. “If I see\r\nplanes and saws hanging on the wall, I know that I am in a carpenter’s\r\nshop.”\r\n\r\n“And I should know,” said Emile, “from seeing an anvil, a hammer, and a\r\npair of tongs, that I was in a blacksmith’s shop. But if I saw a\r\nmortar-board and a trowel, I should look around for the mason.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” Uncle Paul went on, “every creature has its special task in\r\ncreation’s great workshop, where all take part, all work, according to\r\nthe design of Divine Wisdom. Each species has its mission—I might say\r\nits trade to follow—a trade that requires special tools just as does\r\nany work done by man. Now, among the innumerable trades of animals\r\nthere is one that is common to all without exception, the most\r\nimportant trade of all, as without it life itself would be impossible:\r\nit is the business of eating.\r\n\r\n“But all animals do not take the same kind of food. Some need prey, raw\r\nflesh, others fodder; some eat roots, others seeds and fruit. In every\r\ninstance teeth are the tools used in the work of eating; so they must\r\nhave the shape appropriate to the kind of food eaten, whether that be\r\ntough or tender, hard or easy to chew. Therefore, just as from his tool\r\nthe artisan’s work may be inferred, so from the shape of its teeth one\r\ncan usually tell the kind of food eaten by any animal.\r\n\r\n“Herbivorous animals are those that live on grass, fodder, hay; and\r\ncarnivorous animals are those that eat flesh. The horse, the donkey,\r\nthe ox, and the sheep are herbivorous; the dog, the cat, and the wolf,\r\ncarnivorous. The food of the herbivorous animal is tough, hard,\r\nfibrous, and must be ground for a long time by the teeth in order to be\r\nreduced to a paste-like mass suitable for swallowing and, after that,\r\nfor easy digestion. In this case the teeth in both upper and lower jaw\r\nmust have broad and almost flat surfaces that will come together and\r\ngrind the food as millstones grind grain. On the other hand, the flesh\r\neaten by the carnivorous animal is soft, easy to swallow, and easy to\r\ndigest. All that the animal has to do is to tear it apart and cut it\r\ninto shreds. So the teeth here must have sharp edges that come together\r\nand operate like the blades of a pair of scissors.\r\n\r\n“I think I have said enough on that subject. Now, which of you will\r\ntell me what kind of food goes with each of the teeth I show you here?”\r\n\r\nAnd Uncle Paul laid before his hearers the two teeth pictured on these\r\npages, with others to follow.\r\n\r\n“The first tooth,” said Emile, “is flattened and very wide at the top;\r\nit must crush and grind by rubbing against a tooth of the same kind in\r\nthe opposite jaw. So it is the tooth of an animal that eats fodder.”\r\n\r\n“It is indeed,” Uncle Paul replied, “the tooth of an herbivorous\r\nanimal, a horse.”\r\n\r\n“The second,” continued Emile, “is composed of several broad points\r\nwith edges almost as sharp as knife blades. It must be meant for\r\ncutting flesh.”\r\n\r\n“Those winding folds that you see in the horse’s tooth—what are they\r\nfor?” asked Jules. “There is nothing like them in the wolf’s tooth.”\r\n\r\n“I was going to tell you about them,” his uncle replied. “If the\r\nhorse’s teeth had perfectly smooth surfaces, without any roughness to\r\nact as a grater, is it not true that in pressing and rubbing, each\r\nagainst the opposite tooth, they would simply crush the fodder or hay\r\nas you would crush it between two smooth stones without changing it\r\ninto fine powder? Millstones, if they were polished like marble tables,\r\nwould flatten the grain without making flour of it; they must be rough\r\non the surface in order to seize the wheat during the grinding of the\r\nupper stone on the stationary lower one and to make it into powder.\r\nWhen by long use the surface is worn smooth, the stones are of no\r\nservice until they are dented again with the hammer. Well, the folds of\r\na horse’s teeth may be likened to the roughness of a millstone: they\r\nproject a little above the general surface of the tooth, making a sort\r\nof coarse file that tears to pieces blades of grass or hay when rubbed\r\nby the opposite tooth.”\r\n\r\n“I think I see a danger threatening the herbivorous animal,” put in\r\nJules at this point. “Those projecting folds must soon be worn down by\r\nrubbing against one another, just the same as the roughness on the\r\nmillstone. If smooth millstones can’t make flour without being\r\nroughened again, no more can the herbivorous animal’s worn teeth go on\r\ngrinding.”\r\n\r\n“That is provided for, admirably provided for, my boy. Everything in\r\nthe world is arranged so that it can do its work: a wisdom that nothing\r\nescapes watches over the smallest details; everything, even to a\r\ndonkey’s jaw, shows this to be so. Listen, and judge for yourselves.\r\n\r\n“There are two different substances in a tooth: one very hard, a little\r\nlike glass and called enamel; the other quicker to wear out, but very\r\ndifficult to break, and known as ivory. These two substances are\r\ncombined in different ways, according to the animal’s diet. In the\r\nhorse, the sheep, the ox, the donkey, and many other herbivorous\r\nanimals the ivory makes up the main part of the tooth, while the harder\r\nsubstance, the enamel, extends in winding sheets throughout the former,\r\nprojecting a little above its surface in a fold which varies in form in\r\nthe different kinds of animals. So, then, it is the enamel, a substance\r\nas hard as a pebble, that composes the folds in the herbivorous\r\nanimal’s teeth. From the rubbing of the lower teeth against the upper\r\nthe ivory wears away faster than the enamel, so that the folds of the\r\nlatter embedded in the mass of the tooth have their cutting edges\r\nbrought above the general level as fast as required, and thus the\r\ngrinding surfaces are kept in constant repair. You see how it is: in\r\nthe donkey’s food-mill, for instance, the millstones re-roughen\r\nthemselves as fast as necessary for the chewing of a thistle; the\r\nmachinery is self-repairing even while at work.”\r\n\r\n“What you tell us, Uncle, is wonderful,” commented Jules. “I never\r\nshould have guessed that such an arrangement was necessary for chewing\r\na thistle.”\r\n\r\n“And only the other day,” put in Louis, “I kicked out of my way a\r\njaw-bone that was lying in the road. How gladly should I have looked at\r\nit closely if I had known all these things!”\r\n\r\n“Ignorance always kicks things aside like that, my boy, but science is\r\ninterested in everything, knowing that it can always learn something.\r\nBut let us return to the teeth of the carnivorous animals and examine\r\nthose of the wolf.\r\n\r\n“Here the irregularities of the nutmeg-grater, the parallel ridges of\r\nthe file, and the roughness of the millstone would be of no use, since\r\nthe animal’s food is to be torn into shreds and not chewed into paste.\r\nFor the wolf’s food cutting blades are needed—sharp scissors which are\r\nhard enough not to become blunt. Hence the working edges of the wolf’s\r\nteeth are not flat like millstones, but shaped rather like pointed\r\nchisels. The ivory forms the central body of the tooth, making it tough\r\nand strong, while the enamel, harder but more brittle, is spread as a\r\ncontinuous layer over the tooth and furnishes the requisite cutting\r\nedges. In like manner a skilful cutler, when he wishes to make an edged\r\ntool that will cut well and at the same time withstand violent blows,\r\nmakes its central mass of iron, a tough material that bears\r\nconsiderable violence without injury, but is not hard enough to furnish\r\na keen cutting edge. He then overlays it, to obtain such an edge, with\r\nfine steel, which combines excessive hardness with the fragility of\r\nglass. The best that man can contrive in the making of edged tools is\r\nmet with in perfection in the teeth of carnivorous animals.”\r\n\r\n“If I understand you, then,” said Jules, “ivory, which is not so hard\r\nas enamel, but less brittle, forms the interior of the teeth of\r\ncarnivorous animals, and enamel, which is harder and more brittle,\r\nforms the outside layer. Ivory makes the teeth strong; enamel makes\r\nthem cut.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is it.”\r\n\r\n“Now, I don’t know which is the more wonderful, the donkey’s or the\r\nwolf’s set of teeth.”\r\n\r\n“Both are wonderful, as both are admirably adapted to the kind of work\r\nthey have to do.”\r\n\r\n“What surprises me most,” Emile interposed, “is that a lot of things we\r\nshould never pay any attention to turn out to be very interesting when\r\nUncle Paul explains them to us. I never should have thought that the\r\ntime would come when I should listen with pleasure to the history of a\r\ntooth.”\r\n\r\n“Since that interests you,” said Uncle Paul, “I will continue the\r\nsubject a little further and will tell you about human teeth, about\r\nyours, my boy, so white and so well arranged, and so admirably adapted\r\nfor biting a slice of bread and butter.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE DIFFERENT SHAPES OF TEETH\r\n\r\n\r\n“Man has thirty-two teeth, sixteen to each jaw,” Uncle Paul continued.\r\n\r\nEmile already had his finger in his mouth, passing it from one tooth to\r\nanother, to count them. His uncle paused until he had finished the\r\ncount.\r\n\r\n“But I have only twenty, all told,” declared the boy; “twenty, and not\r\nthirty-two.”\r\n\r\n“The other twelve will come some day, my boy; at present you have the\r\nright number of teeth for a child of your age. They do not all come at\r\none time, but one after another. We begin with twenty, and no more.\r\nThey are called milk teeth, or first teeth. When we are about seven\r\nyears old they begin to fall out and are replaced by others stronger\r\nand set in more firmly. In addition to this second score of teeth there\r\nappear later twelve others, bringing the total number up to thirty-two.\r\nThose farthest back, in the inmost cavity of the mouth, come late, when\r\nwe are eighteen or twenty years old, or even older, for which reason\r\nthey are called wisdom teeth to signify that they appear at an age when\r\nthe reason is well developed. These thirty-two last teeth constitute\r\nthe second cutting. I call them last because they are never replaced by\r\nany others; if we lose them, that is the end of our teeth; no more will\r\ncome.”\r\n\r\n“I have two now that are loose,” said Emile.\r\n\r\n“They must come out soon to leave room for the new teeth that are to\r\ntake their place. The others will get loose, too, and the twenty that\r\nyou have now will be succeeded by twenty others, to which, sooner or\r\nlater, will be added twelve more which come only once. These last\r\noccupy the back part of the jaws, three on each side, top and bottom.\r\nThus the final number will be thirty-two.\r\n\r\n“These thirty-two teeth are divided into three classes according to\r\ntheir shape and the work they must do. The same names being repeated\r\ntop and bottom and right and left, I show you merely the eight teeth of\r\nhalf a jaw. In every tooth there are two parts to be distinguished, the\r\ncrown and the root. The root is the part that is embedded in the\r\njaw-bone like a nail hammered into wood; the crown is the part that\r\ncomes into view, and it may be likened to the head of a nail. The root\r\nholds the tooth in place, fixes it firmly; the crown cuts, tears, and\r\ngrinds the food.\r\n\r\n“In the two front teeth in each half-jaw the crown grows thinner toward\r\nthe top. The edge is straight and sharp, fitted for cutting food,\r\ndividing it into small mouthfuls. Therefore these teeth are called\r\nincisors, from the Latin incidere, meaning to cut. Their root is a\r\nsimple pivot. The next tooth is called canine. Its root is a little\r\nlonger than those of the preceding teeth, and its crown is slightly\r\npointed. The dog, the cat, the wolf, and carnivorous animals in general\r\nhave this tooth shaped like a powerful fang, which serves to catch and\r\nhold prey, but above all acts as a weapon in attack and defense. It is\r\nthe canine teeth that you see crossing one another, long and pointed,\r\ntwo on each side, when you raise the upper lip of a cat or a dog.\r\nBecause of these remarkable fangs of carnivorous animals, especially\r\nthe dog, which in Latin is canis, the name canine has been given to the\r\nteeth that in man are like them, if not in form and use, at least in\r\nthe position they occupy.\r\n\r\n“The next five teeth are the most useful of all. They are called\r\nmolars, from the Latin mola, a millstone, because they play the part of\r\nmillstones in grinding the food. For this purpose their crowns are\r\nblunt and broad and slightly irregular, not flat like the horse’s\r\nmolars or with sharp cutting edges like the wolf’s, because man’s food\r\nis not composed exclusively of either vegetables or flesh, but of both\r\nat the same time. For food as varied as man’s there is need of molars\r\nfit for all sorts of service: they must grind like those of the\r\nherbivorous animals and cut like those of the carnivorous; in short,\r\nthey must be like those of both. And, indeed, their wide crowns are\r\nsuited to vegetable food, and their rather sharp irregularities are\r\nadapted to animal food.\r\n\r\n“The first two are called little molars or, in more learned language,\r\nbicuspids, because they have each two cusps or points. They are the\r\nleast strong of the five and have only one root each. The two little\r\nmolars, the canine tooth, and the two incisors (of each half-jaw) are\r\nthe only teeth that are renewed. Multiply them by four and you will\r\nhave the twenty teeth of the first cutting, teeth that begin to fall\r\nout toward the age of seven and are gradually replaced by others. That\r\nis the state of Emile’s teeth at present, there being but twenty of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“The other three teeth, in each half-jaw, come only once. They are the\r\nlarge molars, of which the very end one is also called the wisdom\r\ntooth. As in the act of mastication the large molars have to bear\r\nstrong pressure, the root is composed of several pivots or prongs\r\nreaching down each into a special cavity or socket. This makes them\r\nstrong and firm, so that they can stand pressure both downward and\r\nsideways.\r\n\r\n“To sum up, the grown man has thirty-two teeth in all, sixteen to each\r\njaw; namely, four incisors, two canines, and ten molars. These last are\r\ndivided into four bicuspids or little molars and six large molars; the\r\nmilk teeth do not include these last six.”\r\n\r\nHere Jules had a question to ask. “Ivory and enamel,” said he, “those\r\ntwo substances of different degrees of hardness that you told us were\r\narranged in such a wonderful way in horses’ and wolves’ teeth—are they\r\nin our teeth, too?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, they are there. Ivory forms the entire root, which must serve as\r\na firm support, and it also fills the crown, while enamel merely covers\r\nthe outside as a hard protecting layer.”\r\n\r\n“I am going to get the cat and look at her teeth,” said Emile. “Has she\r\ntwenty, like me, or has she thirty-two?”\r\n\r\n“Neither twenty nor thirty-two, but thirty when full-grown. Dogs and\r\nwolves have forty-two; horses and donkeys forty-four. In fact, the\r\nnumber varies with different animals as much as the shape. Perhaps a\r\nfew words on this subject will not be out of place.\r\n\r\n“First, here is the picture of a wolf’s mouth. If one did not already\r\nknow, one could easily guess the animal’s diet by merely looking at its\r\nteeth. Those deeply indented molars, those strong, curved\r\ncanines—surely they call for wild prey and show great strength. The\r\nwhole set indicates clearly enough a carnivorous appetite. At i are the\r\nincisors, six in number. They are small and of slight use, for the\r\nanimal does not cut its prey into little mouthfuls, but swallows it\r\ngluttonously in great strips. At c are the canines, veritable daggers\r\nwhich the bandit plunges into the sheep’s neck. The little molars are\r\nat m. The large molars come next. The first, marked r, is the\r\nstrongest, and it is with this that the wolf and the dog crack the\r\nhardest bones. Finally, the picture shows the salivary glands; that is,\r\nthe organs that prepare the saliva and let it ooze into the mouth\r\nthrough the canal s as the animal eats. Without dwelling on this point,\r\nwhich would take me too far from my subject, I will merely say that\r\nsaliva serves to soak the food and make a soft mouthful that can be\r\neasily swallowed, and it also plays an important part in the stomach in\r\nreducing to a fluid pap the food taken in; that is to say, it helps to\r\ndigest the food.\r\n\r\n“Let us pass on to the cat, another typical flesh-eater. Six small\r\nincisors are ranged in the front of the jaw like a row of elegant but\r\nuseless pearls. They are ornamental rather than useful to the animal. A\r\nmouse-hunter needs very long and pointed canines for piercing the prey\r\nseized by the claws. In this respect the cat is armed in a very\r\nformidable manner. What do you think of it, Louis?”\r\n\r\n“I think,” he replied, “a rat must be very uncomfortable between those\r\ncurved canines the picture shows us.”\r\n\r\n“One day,” said Emile, “when I was pulling the cat’s mustache, she gave\r\nme a bite that felt like the sharp prick of a needle. It was done so\r\nquickly I had no time to draw my hand back.”\r\n\r\n“The cat brought her canines into play and wounded you with one of them\r\nas quickly as a steel point could have done.\r\n\r\n“Now look at the molars. There are four above, the last one very small,\r\nand three below. Their cusps or points are still sharper than the\r\nwolf’s; so, too, the cat’s appetite—like that of its kindred, the\r\ntiger, the panther, the jaguar, and others—demands more flesh than that\r\nof the wolf and animals like it, such as the fox, the jackal, and\r\nespecially the dog. Have you ever noticed how disdainful the cat is\r\nwhen you throw her only a piece of bread? Scarcely has she smelt it\r\nwhen she makes a movement of superb scorn, tail in the air, back\r\nraised, and looks at you as if to say: ‘Are you making fun of me? I\r\nwant something else.’ Or, if very hungry, she reluctantly bites the\r\nbread, chews it awkwardly, and swallows it with distaste. The dog, on\r\nthe contrary, our good Azor for example, catches the bread joyfully in\r\nhis mouth without letting it touch the ground, and if he finds any\r\nfault with the piece it is for being too small. You call the cat a\r\nglutton. I take her part and maintain that it is not the vice of\r\ngluttony she shows, but that her teeth must have meat. What could you\r\nexpect her pointed canines and keen-edged molars to do with a crust of\r\nbread? They demand, above all, a prey that bleeds, a quivering bit of\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\n“What a difference between the teeth of the hunter and those of the\r\npeaceful chewer of grass! Let us examine this picture of a horse’s\r\nhead. Here the incisors, six in number, are powerful; they seize the\r\nforage and cut it, a mouthful at a time. The canines, of no use here,\r\nshow only as little knobs on the jaw-bone. Next beyond comes a long\r\nvacant space called the bar; that is where the bit is held in the\r\nhorse’s mouth. Back of the bar you see the real grinding mechanism,\r\ncomposed of twelve pairs of strong molars with square, flat crowns\r\nfurnished with slightly projecting folds whose usefulness I have\r\nalready pointed out to you. If I am not much mistaken, here we have a\r\nmill capable of grinding tough straw and fibrous hay.\r\n\r\n“Finally, here is a rabbit’s head. Each jaw is furnished with two\r\nenormous incisors set deep into the bone, bent backward above, and\r\nending each in a sharp-edged crown. What are such incisors as those\r\nmade for?”\r\n\r\n“I know,” Jules quickly replied. “The rabbit is always nibbling. For\r\nwant of better food it will gnaw the bark of a tree and even the wood.\r\nIt uses its incisors to cut its food very fine, to gnaw it.”\r\n\r\n“To gnaw it—that is the right word; hence we give the name of rodents\r\nor gnawers to the various animals having incisors of that kind. Such\r\nare the squirrel, the hare, the rabbit, the rat, and the mouse, those\r\npoor creatures which must gnaw the toughest vegetable substances and\r\nfill their bellies with wood, paper, rags even, when there is nothing\r\nbetter for supplying the mill that is kept always going. But it is not\r\nmerely to satisfy their hunger that these animals are almost\r\nincessantly gnawing; there is another reason for their doing it. Their\r\nincisors grow all their lives and tend to lengthen indefinitely;\r\nconsequently, the animal must wear them away by continual friction, as\r\notherwise their crowns would at last so far overlap that they could not\r\nbe made to meet. Then the poor beast would be unable to seize its food\r\nand would perish. In order to be able to eat when hungry, the rat and\r\nthe rabbit must eat when not hungry, so as to sharpen their incisors\r\nand keep them the right length. It is true that they often turn their\r\nattention to very poor fodder. A splinter of wood, a straw, a mere\r\nnothing suffices to maintain the play of their indefatigable incisors.\r\nRemember, children, the expressive term rodents (which means gnawers),\r\napplied to a whole class of animals akin to the rabbit and the rat;\r\nremember their curious incisors, for we shall have occasion to speak of\r\nthem again hereafter. For the present let us finish our examination of\r\nthe rabbit’s teeth.\r\n\r\n“The canines are lacking; in their place the jaw shows a bar or, in\r\nother words, a large open space. At the extreme back of the mouth are\r\nthe molars, few in number but strong, with flat crowns and several\r\nfolds of enamel. In fact, they make an excellent grinding machine.\r\n\r\n“In giving you these details concerning the different shapes of teeth\r\nin different species of animals, I wished particularly to point out the\r\nfollowing truth: Each species eats a particular kind of food for which\r\nthe teeth are especially formed, so that one might say of any animal,\r\n‘Show me its teeth and I will tell you what it eats.’ In many instances\r\nwhere we cannot examine the teeth we do not know what such and such a\r\ncreature feeds on, and in our hasty judgment we mistake a friend for an\r\nenemy, a helper for a destroyer. If the animal is ugly we condemn it on\r\nthe spot and hate it, accusing it of any number of misdeeds. We declare\r\nwar against it, and never suspect, in our foolishness, that it is a war\r\nat our own expense. But there is a very simple precaution by which we\r\ncan avoid these regrettable mistakes: let us yield to no prejudice,\r\nhowever wide-spread, and before condemning an animal as harmful let us\r\nfind out what sort of teeth it has. They will tell us the animal’s way\r\nof living, as you shall soon see for yourselves.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nBATS\r\n\r\n\r\n“Which of you three can tell me what bats feed upon?” asked Uncle Paul\r\nthe next day.\r\n\r\nAt this question Emile put on his thinking-cap, closing his eyes and\r\nrubbing his forehead; but no ideas came. Nor were Jules and Louis any\r\nprompter with an answer.\r\n\r\n“Nobody knows? Well, then, so much the better, for you will have the\r\nsatisfaction of finding it out for yourselves, from the shape of the\r\nteeth. The incisors, small and weak, which you see on an enlarged scale\r\nin this picture of a bat’s set of teeth—do they look as if they were\r\nmade for gnawing vegetable substances, after the manner of rats and\r\nrabbits? Could they cut any such tough fodder?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not,” replied Jules; “they are too weak to be of much use.\r\nAnd then it seems to me those two sharp, curved fangs must belong to a\r\nflesh-eating animal.”\r\n\r\n“The long, pointed canines do indicate as much, but the molars show it\r\nperhaps still more plainly. With their strong and sharp indented crowns\r\nfitting so well into the sharp-edged depressions of the opposite\r\njaw—are those molars designed to crush grain, to grind, slowly and\r\npatiently, fibrous substances?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Jules; “they are the teeth of a flesh-eater, not the\r\ngrist-mill of an herbivorous animal.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure now,” affirmed Louis, “that the bat lives on prey.”\r\n\r\n“It is a greedy hunter of flesh and blood,” Emile declared. “The cat’s\r\nteeth are not more savage-looking.”\r\n\r\n“All that is quite correct,” said Uncle Paul. “The teeth have taught\r\nyou the chief thing about the animal’s habits. Yes, the bat is a\r\nhunter, an eater of live prey, a little ogre always demanding fresh\r\nmeat. It only remains to find out the kind of game it likes. Evidently\r\nthe size of the prey must suit the size of the hunter. A bat’s head is\r\nno bigger than a large hazelnut. It is true the mouth is split from ear\r\nto ear and can, when wide open, swallow mouthfuls larger than the\r\nsmallness of the animal would lead one to suppose. Nevertheless the bat\r\ncan attack only small creatures. What can it be that it goes chasing\r\nthrough the air when, after sunset, it flies hither and thither\r\nunceasingly?”\r\n\r\n“Gnats, perhaps, and night-moths,” Jules suggested.\r\n\r\n“Exactly. Those are its prey. The bat lives on insects exclusively. All\r\nare food for its maw: hard-winged beetles, slender mosquitoes, plump\r\nmoths, flying insects of all sorts; in fact, all the little winged foes\r\nof our cereals, vines, fruit-trees, woolen stuffs—all those creatures\r\nof the air that come in the evening, attracted by our lighted rooms,\r\nand singe their wings in the flames of our lamps. Who would undertake\r\nto say how many insects bats destroy when they fly around a house? The\r\ngame is so small, and the hunter is so hungry.\r\n\r\n“Notice what happens on a calm summer evening. Lured abroad by the\r\nbalmy atmosphere of the twilight hours, a host of insects leave their\r\nlurking-places and come forth, guests at life’s garden party, to sport\r\ntogether in the air, hunt for food, and mate with one another. It is\r\nthe hour when the sphinx-moths fly abruptly from flower to flower and\r\nthrust their long probosces into the depths of the corollas, where\r\nhoney is stored; the hour when the mosquito, thirsting for human blood,\r\nsounds its war-cry in our ears and selects our tenderest spot to stab\r\nwith its poisoned lancet; the hour when the June-bug leaves the shelter\r\nof the leaf, spreads its buzzing wings, and goes humming through the\r\nair in quest of its fellows. The gnats dance in joyous swarms which the\r\nslightest breath of wind disperses like a column of smoke; butterflies\r\nand moths, in wedding-garments, their wings powdered with silvery dust\r\nand their antennæ spread out like plumes, join in the frolic or seek\r\nplaces in which to deposit their eggs; the wood-borer comes forth from\r\nits hidden retreat under the bark of the elm; the weevil breaks its\r\ncell hollowed out in a grain of wheat; the plume-moths rise in clouds\r\nfrom the granaries and fly toward the fields of ripe cereals; other\r\nmoths explore here the grape-vines, there the pear-trees, apple-trees,\r\ncherry-trees, busily seeking food and shelter for their evil progeny.\r\n\r\n“But in the midst of these festive assemblies suddenly there comes a\r\nkilljoy. It is the bat, which flies hither and thither, up and down,\r\nappearing and disappearing, darting its head out this side and that,\r\nand each time snapping up an insect on the wing, crushing and\r\nswallowing it immediately. The hunting is good; gnats, beetles, and\r\nmoths abound; and every now and then a little cry of joy announces the\r\ncapture of a plump June-bug. As long as the fading twilight permits,\r\nthe eager hunter thus pursues its work of extermination. Satisfied at\r\nlast, the bat flies back to its somber and quiet retreat. The next\r\nevening and all through the summer the hunt is resumed, always with the\r\nsame ardor, always at the expense of insects only.\r\n\r\n“To give you an idea of the multitude of harmful insects, especially of\r\nmoths, from which the bat delivers us, I will quote a passage from the\r\ncelebrated French naturalist Buffon, the most graphic historian of the\r\nanimal kingdom. But first I must tell you that bats are in the habit of\r\nmaking their homes in old towers, grottoes, and abandoned quarries.\r\nThere, in great numbers, they pass the daylight hours, hanging\r\nmotionless from the roof, and thence they sally forth at the approach\r\nof darkness. The floor of these retreats becomes covered at last with a\r\ndeep layer of droppings, from which we can learn the kind of food eaten\r\nby bats and judge of the importance of their hunting. Now here is what\r\nBuffon has to say of a grotto frequented by these creatures:\r\n\r\n\r\n   “Having one day descended into the grottoes of Arci, I was\r\n    surprised to find there a kind of earth of a singular nature. It\r\n    formed a bed of blackish matter several feet thick, almost entirely\r\n    composed of parts of the wings and feet of flies and moths, as if\r\n    these insects had gathered here in immense numbers, coming together\r\n    for the express purpose of dying and rotting in company. It was\r\n    nothing but bats’ dung that had been accumulating for years.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“What a curious kind of soil, made up entirely of the remains of dead\r\ninsects!” Jules exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“I will add that sometimes this soil of flies and moths at the bottom\r\nof old quarries and caves is abundant enough for the farmer to take\r\naccount of it and use it as a rich fertilizer. It is called bats’\r\nguano.”\r\n\r\n“To make such heaps of it, then,” remarked Louis, “bats must destroy\r\ninsects by millions and millions.”\r\n\r\n“Five or six dozen flies or moths are hardly enough for a bat’s evening\r\nmeal; if a few June-bugs should make their appearance, they would be\r\neagerly snapped up. If the band of hunters is a large one, judge of the\r\nthousands of harmful insects destroyed in a single season. Next to the\r\nbirds we have no more valiant helpers than bats; and so I beg you to be\r\nfriendly to these creatures which, while we are asleep and perhaps\r\ndreaming of our rich crops of pears and apples, peaches and grapes and\r\ngrain, proceed with their silent warfare against the enemies of our\r\nharvests, and every evening destroy by myriads moths, mosquitoes,\r\nbeetles, bugs—in short, the greater part of the insect throng that\r\nalways threatens us with starvation if we do not keep vigilant watch.”\r\n\r\n“I see now that the bat does us a good turn,” Emile admitted. “All the\r\nsame, it is frightfully ugly; and, besides, they say if it touches you\r\nit will give you the itch.”\r\n\r\n“There are any number of other sayings about it that are just as\r\nfoolish, my boy. One is that the bat pricks with its pointed teeth the\r\nshe-goat’s udders so as to suck her blood and milk; another is that it\r\ngnaws the sausages and bacon hung under the chimney mantel; also, that\r\nits sudden entrance into a house means misfortune. I have heard persons\r\ncry out because a bat had accidentally grazed them with the tip of its\r\nwing; and I have seen others pale with terror because they had found\r\none of the innocent creatures fastened by a claw to their bed curtains.\r\n\r\n“Here, as in many other things, my dear children, you must take into\r\naccount the folly of mankind, which is more given to error than to\r\ntruth. If you were old enough to understand me, I should add that\r\nwherever I find a general agreement that a thing is black I think it\r\nwell to look into the matter and find out whether, on the contrary, it\r\nmay not be white. We are so stuffed with false notions that very often\r\nthe exact opposite of the common belief is the real truth. Do you ask\r\nfor examples? There are plenty of them.\r\n\r\n“The sun, we generally say, according to all appearances revolves from\r\neast to west around the stationary earth. No, says science, no, it is\r\nthe earth, on the contrary, that rotates from west to east before the\r\nstationary sun. The stars, we say again, are small bright points,\r\nlittle lamps in the arch of the firmament. No, answers science, the\r\nstars are not tiny sparks; they are enormous bodies which compare in\r\nlight and size to the sun itself, a million and a half times as large\r\nas the earth. The bat, it is commonly asserted, is a harmful, hideous,\r\nvenomous creature of ill omen that must be crushed without mercy under\r\nthe heel. No, affirms science, a thousand times no; the bat is an\r\ninoffensive creature that, instead of doing us harm and bringing\r\nmisfortune, renders us an immense service by protecting the good things\r\nof the earth from their countless destroyers.\r\n\r\n“No, we should not vent our hatred upon it and pitilessly kill it; on\r\nthe contrary, we should like and respect it as one of our best helpers.\r\nThe poor creature does not deserve the bad reputation that ignorance\r\nhas given it. Its touch does not communicate either lice or the itch;\r\nits teeth do not pierce the goat’s udders or attack our stores of\r\nbacon; its chance entrance into a room is no more to be dreaded than a\r\nbutterfly’s. For my part I should like to have it visit my bedroom\r\noften at night, for then I should soon be rid of the mosquitoes that\r\ntorment me. All things considered, we have nothing, absolutely nothing\r\nto reproach it with, and we are indebted to it for very valuable\r\nservices. That is the answer of science to ignorant prejudice.\r\nHenceforth, then, crush the bat under your heel if you dare.”\r\n\r\n“I will take good care,” said Louis, “never to do such a thing now that\r\nI know what an army of enemies we are guarded against by the bat.”\r\n\r\n“But what a pity,” Jules remarked, “that it is such a hideous\r\ncreature!”\r\n\r\n“Hideous?” his uncle repeated. “That is a slander which I hope to make\r\nyou take back.”\r\n\r\n“Surely you can’t deny that the bat is horribly ugly,” persisted the\r\nboy.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I can.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to know,” said Emile, “how you can make out that the\r\nfrightful shape of the creature is beautiful.”\r\n\r\n“To discuss ugliness and beauty with you, my children,” replied Uncle\r\nPaul, “is not an undertaking that I should care to enter upon. To\r\nfollow me in such a discussion you would need a maturity of mind that\r\ndoes not go with your years. Even if you were grown up, it might still\r\nbe impossible for us to come to an agreement, inasmuch as it is not\r\nwith the bodily eyes that ugliness and beauty should be judged, but\r\nwith the eyes of reason ripened by reflection and study and free from\r\nthe trammels of first impressions, which are generally erroneous. Also,\r\nhow few possess that intellectual clearness of vision that remains\r\nuntroubled by prematurely conceived opinions and can thus contemplate\r\nthings in all the clarity of truth! Trusting the testimony of our eyes\r\nand yielding to daily habit, we call beautiful the creatures whose\r\ngeneral structure shows a certain conformity with that of the animals\r\nmost familiar to us and unthinkingly accepted as standards for all\r\nfuture judgments. We call ugly those that differ from these accepted\r\nmodels, and if very unlike we call them hideous. Enlightened reason\r\nrefuses to be hemmed in by the narrow circle of first impressions; it\r\nrises above petty prejudices and says to itself: Nothing is ugly that\r\nGod has made; everything is beautiful, everything is perfect in itself,\r\nas everything is the work of the Creator.\r\n\r\n“An animal’s form should not be judged by its greater or less\r\nresemblance to the forms that are already familiar to us and serve us\r\nas standards of comparison, but rather by its fitness for the kind of\r\nlife for which it was created. Where the structure is in perfect\r\nharmony with the functions to be performed, there too is beauty. From\r\nthis higher point of view ugliness no longer exists; or, rather, it\r\nexists all too abundantly, but only in the moral world. Intemperance,\r\nlaziness, stupid pride—all forms of vice, in short—constitute ugliness\r\nand hideousness. To tell the truth, I know of none besides.\r\n\r\n“But I must return to the bat, if not in the hope of making you find it\r\nbeautiful, at least with the certainty of interesting you in its\r\nremarkable structure. I will wager, too, that not one of you knows what\r\na bat is.”\r\n\r\n“It is a kind of bird,” declared Emile.\r\n\r\n“It is an old rat that has grown a pair of wings,” Jules ventured to\r\nassert.\r\n\r\n“You are both talking nonsense,” returned their uncle. “That is the way\r\nwith us all: we speak at random of animals and persons, giving to one\r\nour esteem, to another our scorn, without knowing what they are, what\r\nthey do, what they are good for. You don’t know the first thing about\r\nthe bat, and yet you overwhelm the poor animal with abuse.\r\n\r\n“The bat has nothing in common with birds; it has neither beak nor\r\nfeathers; nor is it a rat that has acquired wings in its old age. It is\r\nreally a peculiar creature that is born, lives, and dies with wings,\r\nwithout in any way belonging to the bird family. Its body has the size,\r\nthe fur, and somewhat the shape of a mouse; but its wings are bare.\r\n\r\n“The most highly organized animals have as a distinctive mark teats or\r\nudders, which furnish milk, the first food of their young. These\r\nanimals do not feed their young family from the beak, as birds do; they\r\ndo not abandon their offspring to all the hazards of good or ill\r\nfortune, careless of their future, as do the stupid races of reptiles\r\nand fish. The females rear their young with maternal care, feeding them\r\nfrom time to time with milk from their udders. All the various species\r\nthat suckle their young, all that are provided with udders, are classed\r\ntogether by men of learning and called mammals, from the Latin mamma, a\r\nbreast or teat. I will add that in the great majority of instances\r\nthese animals have the body covered with fur or hair, and not with\r\nfeathers or scales. Feathers belong to birds, scales to reptiles and\r\nfishes. As examples of mammals you will immediately think of our\r\ndomestic animals, the dog, the cat, the cow, the sheep, the goat, the\r\nhorse, and others.”\r\n\r\n“I have often noticed,” said Emile, “how carefully the cat raises her\r\nfamily. While the kittens press her teats with their little pink paws\r\nto make the milk flow faster, the old cat washes them with her tongue\r\nand shows her happiness by her soft purring.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” resumed Uncle Paul, “the bat is a mammal just as much as\r\nis the cat, and like that of the cat its body is protected from the\r\ncold by fur, and the female has teats for nursing her little ones. The\r\nnumber of teats varies widely in the different kinds of animals, being\r\ngreater in the species that have many young at a birth, and less in the\r\nothers; which is as it should be, in order that the nurslings may all\r\nbe suckled at the same time. The bat has only two, situated on the\r\nbreast and not under the stomach. The female bears only a single young\r\none at a time. Emile rightly admires the love of the cat for her\r\nkittens; yet the bat is a still tenderer mother. When in the evening\r\nshe goes out in search of food, instead of leaving her nursling in some\r\nhole in the wall after suckling it, she carries it with her, clinging\r\nto her breast; and it is while weighted with this load that she chases\r\nthe nimble moths on the wing. Doubtless the pursuit of prey is thus\r\nrendered less fruitful and more difficult; but no matter, the loving\r\nmother prefers not to abandon her feeble charge, and allows it to\r\ncontinue peacefully sucking during the evolutions of the hunt. With the\r\ndeepening darkness the bat regains its retreat, suspends itself from\r\nthe roof by a toe-nail, and holds its nursling by wrapping it in her\r\nwings.”\r\n\r\n“That is not so bad a way to behave,” admitted Jules. “I begin to find\r\nthe bat less ugly than I thought.”\r\n\r\n“That is what I just told you,” returned his uncle. “Ugliness is\r\nbegotten of ignorance; it diminishes as knowledge increases. But let us\r\ncontinue our theme.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE BAT’S WINGS\r\n\r\n\r\n“Wings, real wings, perfectly adapted to flying, are the bat’s most\r\nstriking feature. How can a mammal, an animal whose general structure\r\nis that of a dog or a cat for example, possess the flying-apparatus of\r\na bird? How can two organs so entirely different be combined? In the\r\nbat’s wing, my children, we find an admirable example of the infinite\r\nresources at the command of the Creator, who, without adding to or\r\nsubtracting from the fundamental plan, has adapted the same organs to\r\nthe most widely different functions. The fore feet of mammals—of the\r\ndog, or the cat we will say—are changed into wings in the bat without\r\nthe addition or the loss of a single part in this incredible\r\ntransformation. More than that, the human arms, our arms, children—are\r\nthere represented, piece by piece, bone by bone. You all look at me as\r\nif you did not believe it, unable to understand how there can be\r\nanything in common between our arms and a bat’s wings.”\r\n\r\n“The fact is,” Jules confessed, “it takes all my faith in your words to\r\nmake me admit that there can be the least likeness between a man’s arm\r\nand a bat’s wing.”\r\n\r\n“I do not propose to make you admit it because of your faith in me; I\r\npropose to prove it to you. Follow along your arm so as to grasp the\r\ndemonstration better.\r\n\r\n“From the shoulder to the elbow the framework of the human arm consists\r\nof a bone known as the humerus. From the elbow to the wrist there are\r\ntwo bones of unequal size running side by side the whole length. The\r\nlarger is the cubitus, the smaller the radius. Then comes the wrist,\r\ncomposed of several little bones which I will not now describe. Next is\r\nthe palm of the hand, its framework formed of a row of five bones\r\nalmost alike and each serving to support a finger. Finally, each finger\r\ncontains a succession of small bones called phalanges, of which the\r\nthumb has two, and all the others three each. I will add that two bones\r\nserve to attach the arm to the body. One is the shoulder-blade, a broad\r\ntriangular bone situated on the back behind the shoulder; the other is\r\nthe collar bone, slender and curved, situated in front and extending\r\nfrom the shoulder to the base of the neck. Those are the collar-bones\r\nthat you can feel with your hand at the right and left above the\r\nbreast.”\r\n\r\nWhile thus enumerating the parts of the arm, Uncle Paul guided the hand\r\nof each listener and made it feel the several bones as they were named.\r\nEmile had some difficulty with the learned terms “humerus” and\r\n“cubitus,” which he now heard for the first time; nevertheless, by\r\npaying close attention he found that he could easily remember them.\r\nWhen the boys had all learned the name and the position of each bone in\r\nthe human arm, their uncle continued:\r\n\r\n“Now examine with me this picture of a bat’s skeleton. The bone marked\r\no is the shoulder-blade. As with us, it forms the back of the shoulder,\r\nand it is triangular, wide, and flat.”\r\n\r\n“Then the part marked cl is the shoulder, and the bone that goes from\r\nthere to the base of the neck is the collar-bone?” queried Emile.\r\n\r\n“Precisely.”\r\n\r\n“I see how the rest goes,” Louis hastened to interpose. “The bone\r\nmarked h is the humerus, and the elbow is at the angle made by this\r\nbone with the next.”\r\n\r\n“My turn now,” put in Jules. “The two bones running side by side from\r\nthe elbow to the wrist are marked cu and r. The first is the cubitus,\r\nthe other the radius. Consequently ca is the wrist. But there I get\r\nlost.”\r\n\r\n“The wrist, I told you,” explained Uncle Paul, “is composed of several\r\nsmall bones. That structure we find at ca, the bat’s wrist.”\r\n\r\n“But, then, the hand?” queried Jules.\r\n\r\n“The palm of the hand and the five fingers which it supports are\r\nrepresented by the ribs of the wing and by po, which is the thumb. This\r\nis the shortest of the five fingers, as with man. It forms no part of\r\nthe framework of the wing, but is free and is furnished with a hooked\r\nnail which the animal uses to cling by and also in walking. Finally,\r\nthis thumb has two phalanges, as in the human thumb, and at the base is\r\na small bone which in man forms a part of the palm of the hand. So much\r\nfor the thumb.\r\n\r\n“Now let us look at those four long bones that start from the wrist\r\n(ca) and spread out through the greater part of the wing. Together with\r\nthe similar but shorter bone of the thumb they represent the series of\r\nfive bones composing the framework of the human palm. Next come the\r\nfingers with their phalanges (ph). In short, except for a few slight\r\ndifferences, the bat’s wing reproduces, piece by piece, the structure\r\nof the human arm.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Jules admitted, “it’s all there, even to the small bones of the\r\nwrist and fingers. Is it possible that a poor bat can pattern after us\r\nso closely? The horrid creature copies our arms to make itself wings.”\r\n\r\n“Your pride need not suffer from this close resemblance, which you will\r\nfind in different degrees in a multitude of other animals, especially\r\namong the mammals, our next of kin in bodily structure. In the\r\nformation of his body man enjoys no monopoly; the dog, the cat, the\r\ndonkey, the ox—each and all of them—share with us a common stock of\r\norgans, modified in details and suited to the kind of life of each\r\nspecies. We recognize in the bat’s wings the fundamental plan of our\r\narms; we see it also no less plainly in the fore legs of the cat, the\r\ndog, and many other animals, and we can trace a rude resemblance to our\r\nhand even in the donkey’s homely hoof. I tell you these things, my\r\nchildren, not to lessen in your eyes the undeniable superiority of man,\r\nbut to inspire in you a fellow feeling for animals that are formed like\r\nus, suffer as we do, and are far too often the victims of our stupid\r\ncruelty. Whoever needlessly causes an animal to suffer commits a\r\nbarbarous act, an inhuman act, inasmuch as he inflicts torture on flesh\r\nlike our own; he brutally misuses a body having the same mechanism as\r\nour own and the same power of suffering. As to our superiority, it is\r\nestablished preëminently by an exceptional characteristic that places\r\nus above all comparison even with creatures that in their physical\r\nstructure most closely resemble us. This characteristic is reason, the\r\ntorch that lights us in our search for truth; it is the human soul,\r\nwhich alone knows itself and enjoys the sublime privilege of knowing\r\nits divine Author.\r\n\r\n“In bats four of the five bones similar to those of our palm are\r\ngreatly elongated, as are also the corresponding fingers, and they\r\ntogether constitute the four ribs on which is stretched the membrane of\r\nthe wing, just as silk is stretched on the ribs of an umbrella. Thus it\r\nis at the sacrifice of what might have been a hand that the wing is\r\nformed. Therefore the scientists call all mammals of like structure\r\nwith the bat ‘chiropters,’ meaning hand-winged creatures, from two\r\nGreek words signifying hand and wing.\r\n\r\n“Of the five fingers one only, the thumb, is left free in the bat, and\r\nit is very small. It is furnished, as I said before, with a nail or\r\nclaw. The four others, destitute of nails, are lengthened to serve as\r\nsupports to the membrane of the wing. This membrane is a fold of the\r\nskin which starts from the shoulder, stretches between the four long\r\nfingers of the hand, and then attaches itself to the hind leg, the toes\r\nof which are all furnished with hooked nails or claws and do not depart\r\nfrom the ordinary shape of such members. By virtue of the free thumb\r\nalready described the wings are able to serve as feet in walking, when\r\nthese members are folded close to the animal’s sides. The bat grips the\r\nground by thrusting in first the right claw and then the left, and\r\npushes itself forward with its hind feet in laborious and awkward\r\nleaps. Thus it gets over the ground at what might be called a fast\r\npace, but is soon tired out with the exertion; hence it does not walk\r\nexcept when sure it will not be molested or when it is compelled to do\r\nso by its position on a level surface where it cannot launch itself\r\ninto the air. Then as soon as possible it gains an elevated point, from\r\nwhich it flies off. For in order to unfold the hampering membranes that\r\nserve as wings and to throw itself into the air, the bat needs\r\nconsiderable free space, which it cannot get except by hurling itself\r\nfrom a height. Consequently, in the caves inhabited by bats they never\r\nfail to secure an unimpeded drop. With the hooked talons of a hind foot\r\nthey cling to the roof, head downward. That is the way they rest, the\r\nway they sleep. At the slightest alarm the claw lets go, the wings\r\nspread, and the animal is off.”\r\n\r\n“What a queer way to sleep,” Emile exclaimed, “hanging from the roof by\r\none foot, head downward! And do they stay that way long without getting\r\ntired?”\r\n\r\n“If necessary, a good half of the year.”\r\n\r\nWhen he went to bed that night Emile thought again of the bat’s way of\r\nsleeping; but he preferred his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE BAT’S SENSES OF SMELL AND HEARING\r\n\r\n\r\n“Bats are nocturnal,” Uncle Paul continued the next day; “that is, they\r\nleave their lurking-places only at nightfall, to hunt in the evening\r\ntwilight. As a rule, animals addicted to nocturnal hunting have very\r\nlarge eyes that take in as much light as possible, and thus these\r\nanimals can see with very little light. Night-birds, such as owls of\r\nall kinds, will furnish us a remarkable example a little later. By a\r\nsingular exception, however, despite their nocturnal habits bats have\r\nvery small eyes. How, then, are they able to direct themselves in their\r\nswift flight, so abrupt in its changes of direction? How, above all,\r\nare they aware of the presence of their tiny game—moths and gnats?\r\n\r\n“They are guided especially by their senses of smell and hearing, which\r\nare extraordinarily acute. What do you say to the bat’s ears in this\r\npicture? What animal of its size can show anything like them? How they\r\nflare, like enormous hearing-trumpets, to receive the slightest sound!\r\nThe bat that bears them has the expressive name of long-eared bat.”\r\n\r\n“Long-eared bat,” repeated Jules; “that’s the kind of name I like; it\r\ndescribes the animal and shows what there is about it that is out of\r\nthe ordinary.”\r\n\r\n“Such prodigious ears are certainly made to hear sounds inaudible to us\r\nby reason of their excessive faintness. They enable their possessor to\r\nhear at a distance the beating of a moth’s wings and the fluttering of\r\na gnat dancing in the air.\r\n\r\n“Other bats which have smaller ears have as a substitute a sense of\r\nsmell unequaled for its acuteness. The high state of perfection of this\r\nsense is the result of the abnormal development of the nose, which\r\ncovers a good part of the face and gives the animal a very strange\r\nappearance. For example, here is the head of a bat called the horseshoe\r\nbat. This broad, distended formation of curious shape that occupies\r\nalmost the whole space between the eyes and the mouth is the nose. It\r\nends above in a large triangular, leaflike expanse; laterally it\r\nspreads out in folded laminæ, all together taking the shape of a\r\nhorseshoe, whence the name of the creature. What odor, however faint,\r\ncould escape such a nose? The dog, so famous for its keenness of scent,\r\nchases the hare without seeing it, guided solely by the odor left\r\nbehind by the animal, heated in the chase; but how much keener the\r\nscent of the horseshoe bat must be when it chases in the same manner a\r\nmoth that leaves no odor for any nose but its pursuer’s! I sometimes\r\nwonder whether such a nose, so abnormally developed, may not be able to\r\ndetect certain qualities that are and always will be unknown to us for\r\nwant of the means to perceive them. The horseshoe bat’s grotesque nose\r\nmakes you laugh, my little friends; it makes me think. I think of the\r\nthousand secrets that nature hides from our senses and that would be as\r\neasy for us to learn as they would be valuable if we possessed the\r\nscent of a poor bat. Perhaps (who can tell?) the horseshoe bat foresees\r\nwith its nose the coming storm several days in advance; it may scent\r\nthe future hurricane, smell the rain-clouds coming from the other end\r\nof the earth, know by detecting their odor what winds are about to\r\nblow, foretell in similar manner what the weather is going to be; and,\r\nguided by perceptions of which we can form no idea, it may make its\r\nplans for hunting insects that are sometimes abundant and sometimes\r\nscarce according to the state of the atmosphere.”\r\n\r\n“If the horseshoe bat’s nose can do all that,” said Jules, “we must\r\nagree that it is a first-rate sort of nose.”\r\n\r\n“I make no positive assertions,” his uncle rejoined. “I merely have my\r\nsuspicions. The only thing that seems to me beyond doubt is that such\r\nan organ as the bat’s nose serves its owner as a source of sensations\r\nunknown to man.”\r\n\r\n“You say so many wonderful things about it, Uncle,” Emile interposed,\r\n“that I shall end by thinking the horseshoe bat’s nose much more\r\ncurious than ugly. There’s another thing, too, I’ve just noticed. Why\r\ndoes the creature have such fat cheeks? See what a puffed-up face it\r\nhas in the picture.”\r\n\r\n“With the bat,” Uncle Paul explained, “the chase is a short one,\r\nlasting only one or two hours—in fact, the short interval between\r\nsunset and dark. The remainder of the twenty-four hours is passed in\r\nrest, in the quiet of some cavern or grotto. Does the animal, then,\r\nhave but one meal in all this time? And what if there are evenings when\r\nhunting is out of the question, the sky being overcast, the wind too\r\nstrong, or rain falling, so that the insects keep under cover? The bat\r\nwould then be subjected to long fasts if it were impossible for it to\r\nlay in supplies beforehand. But these supplies must be collected\r\nhastily, on the wing, with no interruption to the hunt which lasts so\r\nshort a time. Hence it is that pouches are indispensable, deep pouches\r\nin which the hunter can put his game as fast as he catches it. The\r\ncheeks exactly fill this office: they can be enlarged at the creature’s\r\nwill—distended so as to form roomy pockets in which the insects killed\r\nwith a snap of the teeth can be stowed away. These reserve pockets are\r\ncalled cheek-pouches. Gluttonous monkeys have them. That is where the\r\nshe-ape, fond of sweets, puts the lump of sugar given her and lets it\r\nslowly melt so as to prolong the enjoyment of it. Well, when the bat is\r\nout hunting it first satisfies its hunger, and then—especially when its\r\nnose, the famous nose that we have just been talking about, predicts\r\nunfavorable weather for the following days—it redoubles its exertions\r\nand stows away moth after moth in the depths of its elastic pouches. It\r\nreturns to its quarters with cheeks all distended. Now without fear of\r\nfamine it can remain idle for several days if necessary. Hanging\r\nmotionless by a hind claw, it feeds on its store of provisions,\r\nnibbling one at a time, as hunger prompts, the insects softened to\r\ntaste in the reservoir of its cheeks.\r\n\r\n“But it is high time we finished with the bats; their history would be\r\ntoo long if I were to tell you all about them. I will only ask Jules\r\nwhat he thinks now of the animal he at first called hideous.”\r\n\r\n“Frankly, Uncle,” answered the boy, “these creatures interest me now\r\nmore than they disgust me. Their singular wings, formed at the cost of\r\nwhat might have been hands, their prodigious nose and immense ears\r\nwhich make up for their poor eyesight, their cheeks swollen so as to\r\nmake pouches for their supply of food—all these have interested me very\r\nmuch.”\r\n\r\n“The cheek-pouches,” said Emile, “where the bat puts its game to soak,\r\nand the nose that scents the coming storm, seemed to me the most\r\ncurious things about the animal.”\r\n\r\n“And I,” said Louis, “shall never forget how many enemies bats deliver\r\nus from.”\r\n\r\n“Now you understand,” Uncle Paul rejoined, “or at least I hope you are\r\nbeginning to understand, that bats, being so useful to us in destroying\r\na multitude of ravaging insects, and noteworthy for their singular\r\nstructure, should not inspire us with an unjustifiable repugnance and\r\nstill less with a stupid rage to exterminate them. Let us leave in\r\npeace these poor creatures that so valiantly earn their living by\r\nprotecting our crops. Do not let us harm them under the foolish pretext\r\nthat they are ugly, for their supposed ugliness is in reality an\r\nadmirable adaptation of bodily structure to the creature’s mode of\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE HEDGEHOG\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his walled garden Uncle Paul allowed a couple of hedgehogs, which he\r\nhad brought from the neighboring hills, to wander at large. One evening\r\nthe children noticed them poking about in a lettuce patch.\r\n\r\n“Why,” asked Emile, “has Uncle Paul put those animals in the garden and\r\ntold us to leave them alone if we happened to come across them?”\r\n\r\n“No doubt to make war on harmful insects,” answered Louis. “Stop, look\r\nthere! One of them is turning up the earth with its little black snout.\r\nSsh! Let’s keep still and see what it’s after.”\r\n\r\nThe children crouched down behind a row of peas so as not to be seen.\r\nThe hedgehog, now scratching with its paws, now rummaging with the tip\r\nof its snout, which resembles that of a pig, finally unearthed a big,\r\nfat white larva which had probably been clinging to the root of a\r\nlettuce plant. The children ran to look at the captured game. The\r\nhedgehog, thus taken by surprise, hastened to roll itself up into a\r\nball bristling with spines. In the disinterred worm Jules easily\r\nrecognized a June-bug larva, one of that ravenous and destructive race\r\nthat Uncle Paul had already told them about. [1]\r\n\r\nIn the evening, when they were all gathered together, the hedgehog\r\nnaturally became the subject of conversation.\r\n\r\n“Several years ago,” said Uncle Paul, “as I was returning home one\r\nevening at a late hour, I chanced upon two hedgehogs coming out from a\r\npile of stones. I tied them up in my handkerchief so as to bring them\r\nhome and let them loose in my garden. Ever since then they have never\r\nfailed to render me certain services that you can appreciate by\r\nexamining the jaws in this picture.”\r\n\r\n“Pointed teeth like those,” Jules remarked, “were never made for\r\nbrowsing grass. The hedgehog must feed on prey. Its teeth are just\r\nright for crunching June-bug worms such as I saw dug up in the garden\r\nthis morning.”\r\n\r\n“Notice how sharp the points of the teeth are,” resumed his uncle,\r\n“both in the upper and in the lower jaw. Those two rows of teeth fit\r\ninto each other when the animal bites, and they plunge like so many\r\nfine daggers into the captured victim’s flesh. With this complicated\r\ndental mechanism evidently the hedgehog cannot triturate tough food; it\r\nmust have a kind of diet that is soft, juicy, capable of being reduced\r\nto marmalade by a brief chewing. The animal is therefore preëminently a\r\nflesh-eater. Several other species, particularly the mole and the\r\nshrew-mouse of these regions, have, like the hedgehog, teeth tapering\r\nto conical points and interplaying in the two jaws. Their food, too, is\r\nabout the same as the hedgehog’s. All three—hedgehog, mole, and\r\nshrew-mouse—live on small game—insects, larvæ, slugs, caterpillars,\r\nworms. They belong to the group of mammals known to naturalists as the\r\norder of insectivorous animals, or, in other words, the order of\r\ninsect-eaters. On and under the ground they carry on the same kind of\r\nhunt that bats do in the air. In their way of living bats, too, are\r\ninsectivorous; but their peculiar bodily structure causes them to be\r\nplaced apart in the order of chiropters. Thus the mammals furnish us\r\ntwo orders of helpers: the chiropters, which hunt on the wing, and the\r\ninsect-eaters—the insectivorous animals properly so called—which hunt\r\non and under the ground. To the latter belong the hedgehog, the mole,\r\nand the shrew-mouse.\r\n\r\n“The hedgehog, the largest of the three, requires the largest and most\r\nplentiful prey. Tiny vermin are disdained, but a June-bug larva or a\r\ngood fat mole-cricket is an excellent find. When they are not buried\r\ntoo deep he digs with his paws and snout to unearth them. You have\r\nto-day seen my hedgehogs at work in the lettuce bed. All night they go\r\nprowling about the garden, sniffing and rummaging in every nook and\r\ncorner, and crunching no small number of my foes without doing me much\r\nharm. In them I have two vigilant watchmen who make their rounds every\r\nnight for the greater security of my growing vegetables. However,\r\ndespite the interest I take in them, I must, to be candid, acknowledge\r\ntheir faults.\r\n\r\n“The hedgehog’s natural food consists unquestionably of insects; but\r\nwhen a good opportunity presents itself the greedy creature is easily\r\ntempted by larger and more highly flavored prey. In its wild state the\r\nhedgehog does not hesitate to suck the blood of young rabbits caught in\r\ntheir hole during the mother’s absence. The eggs of quail and\r\npartridge, too, it esteems as a most delicious feast, but its supreme\r\ndelight is to wring the necks of a brood of little chickens. One night\r\nlast year I heard a great commotion in the hen-house. The roosters were\r\nraising cries of alarm, the hens were cackling in desperate fright. I\r\nran out to see what the trouble was. One of my hedgehogs had crept in\r\nunder the door, and I found the rogue regaling himself on some little\r\nchickens almost under their mother’s wing, she being powerless to help\r\nthem in the dark. With one kick I sent the assassin rolling outside,\r\nand the next day thorough repairs were taken in hand. The holes on a\r\nlevel with the floor were closed up, and since then I have had no\r\nfurther trouble from my insect-hunters. With proper precautions against\r\ntheir thirst for blood, I have two larva-devourers of great value for\r\nmy garden.”\r\n\r\n“But won’t they do damage of another kind?” asked Louis. “I have heard\r\nthat hedgehogs climb trees and shake off the ripe fruit, and then roll\r\non it so as to spit it with their spines, after which they carry it off\r\nto their holes and eat it at their ease.”\r\n\r\n“Pay no attention to any such stories, my boy. It is utterly impossible\r\nfor a hedgehog to climb a tree. Clumsy and stubby as it is, with legs\r\nso short and claws useless for climbing, how could it manage an\r\nathletic feat that calls for agility, hooked claws, and supple limbs?\r\nNo, my friend, the hedgehog does not climb trees, neither does it carry\r\noff fruit transfixed with its spines. The only vestige of truth in that\r\nold wives’ tale is that hedgehogs do not live exclusively on prey; if\r\nthey find fruit that they like on the ground, a very ripe pear or a\r\njuicy peach, for example, they munch it with as great contentment as\r\nthey would a beetle or a June-bug.”\r\n\r\n“It is also said,” Louis added, “that if kept in a house the hedgehog\r\nwill drive away rats.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that I am quite willing to believe. By day the animal crouches in\r\na corner and sleeps, but at night it is on the move, always hunting for\r\nslugs, fat beetles, and other insects. Consequently it may well be that\r\nits noisy hunt for prey as it goes poking its pointed snout into every\r\nhole and cranny frightens the rats and mice and drives them away,\r\nespecially as the nocturnal prowler exhales a disagreeable odor\r\ncalculated to betray its presence. Having neither the cat’s light paw\r\nnor that animal’s great patience in lying in wait for game, the\r\nhedgehog does not indulge in hunting rats; but if by good luck one\r\nfalls into its clutches, it is accepted with delight, for the\r\nhedgehog’s great feast is blood, freshly killed flesh. When I wish to\r\ngive my two hedgehogs a special treat I throw them a bleeding beef\r\nliver or a chicken’s entrails. Anything of that sort is eagerly\r\ndevoured. Tastes so undisguisedly carnivorous tell you what must happen\r\nto a mouse caught by one of these animals. I attribute to them the\r\ndisappearance of some nests of rats that used to trouble me.\r\n\r\n“To satisfy its devouring hunger the hedgehog appears to attack all\r\nsorts of prey alike, even planting its teeth in a viper without any\r\nthought of the reptile’s venom; and in still other respects the animal\r\nenjoys a remarkable immunity. You have seen the Spanish fly, that\r\nmagnificent, strong-smelling insect that lives on ash-trees and is\r\ndistinguished by sheath wings of a superb golden green.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I remember it,” said Jules. “It is used for raising blisters\r\nafter being dried and ground to powder.”\r\n\r\n“That is correct. If, then, this powder eats into the skin so readily,\r\nwhat effect ought it to have on the delicate lining of the stomach if\r\nintroduced into that organ? What animal could swallow it without\r\nsuffering torture and speedy death? Well, by an exception that I cannot\r\nundertake to explain the hedgehog can feed on this horrible poison\r\nwithout the slightest apparent injury. A celebrated Russian naturalist,\r\nPallas, has seen it make a meal on Spanish flies with no ill results.\r\nFor a repast of that sort a stomach peculiarly constructed is certainly\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n“Once upon a time there was a king, very well known in history, named\r\nMithridates. Being aware that he was surrounded by enemies capable of\r\npoisoning him some day, in order to obviate the danger he gradually\r\naccustomed himself to the most noxious drugs. By increasing the dose\r\nlittle by little he finally rendered himself immune against poison. The\r\nhedgehog is the Mithridates of the animal kingdom; but how far it\r\nsurpasses the suspicious king! Without practice it dares swallow the\r\npoison of the Spanish fly and the viper’s deadly venom.\r\n\r\n“I like to believe that the hedgehog has not received these exceptional\r\ngifts only to leave them unused. It must delight to frequent the haunts\r\nof the viper; in its nocturnal rounds in the underbrush it must\r\noccasionally come upon the reptile in its retreat and crush its head\r\nwith those pointed teeth that are so well adapted to such work. What\r\nservice may it not render in localities infested with this dangerous\r\nbreed! And yet man rages at the hedgehog, curses it most heartily, and\r\ntreats it as an unclean beast of no use but to arouse the fury of dogs,\r\nwhich cannot attack it because of its spines. He subjects it to the\r\ntorture of an ice-cold bath to make it unroll itself; and if the animal\r\nrefuses to do so he prods it with a pointed stick, goads it,\r\ndisembowels it.”\r\n\r\n“We will never meddle with hedgehogs, Uncle Paul,” Jules assured him.\r\n“We are too much afraid of snakes to drive away this valiant defender.”\r\n\r\n“What are the hedgehog’s spines?” asked Emile.\r\n\r\n“Hairs, nothing else, but very coarse, and stiff, and pointed like\r\nneedles. Together with other hairs, fine, soft, and silky, they cover\r\nall the upper part of the body. The under part has only a coat of soft\r\nhair; otherwise the animal would wound itself in rolling up into a\r\nball. When the hedgehog scents danger—and it is a very wary beast—it\r\nducks its head under its stomach, draws in its paws, and rolls itself\r\ninto a ball, presenting everywhere an armor of spines to the enemy. The\r\nfox has long been famous for its many ruses; the hedgehog has only one,\r\nbut it is always effective. Who would dare grapple with the creature\r\nwhen it has assumed its attitude of defense? The dog refuses; after a\r\nfew luckless essays that make its mouth bleed it declines to go further\r\nand contents itself with barking. Sheltered under the safe cover of its\r\nspines, the hedgehog turns a deaf ear to these futile threats and\r\nremains quiet.\r\n\r\n“But if the dog, urged on by its master, returns to the charge, the\r\nhedgehog has recourse to a last expedient of war which rarely fails of\r\neffect: it discharges its strongly offensive urine, which flows from\r\nthe inside of the ball and wets the outside. Repelled by the unbearable\r\nodor of the ill-smelling beast and pricked on the nose by its spines,\r\neven the most eager dog now abandons the attack. The enemy gone, the\r\nhedgehog slowly unrolls itself and trots off to some safe retreat.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nHIBERNATION\r\n\r\n\r\n“Our bats,” continued Uncle Paul, “live exclusively on insects, and\r\nthese constitute the hedgehog’s chief food, but it also hunts larger\r\ngame or even eats fruit. In winter there are no longer any plump\r\ninsects to be had, most of them having died after laying their eggs,\r\nand the few surviving ones having taken refuge from the cold in\r\nhiding-places where they would be very hard to find. The larvæ, too,\r\nthe hope of future generations, are lying torpid, far out of sight\r\nunder the ground, in the trunks of old trees, snugly hidden away. The\r\nwhite worm has bored several feet into the ground to escape the frost,\r\nthere are no more June-bugs for the long-eared owl, no more\r\nnight-flying moths, and no more beetles for the hedgehog. What, then,\r\nis to become of these insect-eaters?”\r\n\r\n“They will die of hunger,” answered Jules.\r\n\r\n“They would indeed all die, were it not for the providential\r\narrangement I am now going to try to make you understand.\r\n\r\n“You know the proverb, ‘He who sleeps dines,’—a very true proverb in\r\nits simple statement of an undeniable fact. Well, the hedgehog, the\r\nbat, and other animals put the principle into practice with a wisdom\r\nquite equal to that of man. Not being able to dine, for want of\r\ninsects, they go to sleep; and so deep and heavy is their sleep that to\r\ndesignate it we use a special word, lethargy.\r\n\r\n“Another proverb says, ‘As you make your bed, so must you lie.’ Our\r\ndumb animals, never lacking in wisdom in ordering their own affairs,\r\ntake good care not to forget this proverb, but to adopt wise\r\nprecautions before abandoning themselves to their long winter sleep.\r\nThe hedgehog chooses for itself a secure retreat amid the great roots\r\nof some old tree stump. Toward the end of the autumn it carries grass\r\nand dry leaves to deposit there, and arranges them in a hollow ball, in\r\nthe middle of which it rolls itself up and goes to sleep. Bats assemble\r\nin great numbers in the warm depths of some cavern where nothing can\r\ndisturb their slumbers. Heads down and bodies packed close together,\r\nthey hug the walls, covering them with a sort of velvet tapestry; or,\r\nclinging to one another, they hang in bunches from the roof. Now the\r\nwinter may do its worst and the winds may rage; the hedgehog in its\r\nwarm blanket of leaves and the bats in their sheltered caves sleep a\r\ndeep sleep until summer returns and with it insects, food, animation,\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\n“But don’t they eat anything all winter long?” asked Emile,\r\nincredulously.\r\n\r\n“Nothing whatever,” his uncle assured him.\r\n\r\n“Then bats and hedgehogs must have a secret. For my part, I eat more in\r\nthe winter than at any other time, and no amount of sleep would satisfy\r\nmy hunger.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, the bat and the hedgehog have a secret in this matter. I am going\r\nto tell you this secret, but it is a little hard to understand, I warn\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n“There is one need before which hunger and thirst are silent, however\r\ngreat they may be; a need that is never satisfied, and is always making\r\nitself felt, whether we wake or sleep, by night, by day, every hour,\r\nevery minute. It is the need of air. Air is so essential to the\r\nmaintenance of life that it has not been left to us to regulate its use\r\nas we do in regard to food and drink; and this is so in order that we\r\nmay not be exposed to the fatal consequences that would follow the\r\nslightest forgetfulness. Therefore it is with little or no\r\nconsciousness on our part and independently of our will that air gains\r\nentrance into our body to do its marvelous work there. On air more than\r\non anything else do we live, our daily bread coming only second in the\r\norder of importance. Our need of food is felt at only tolerably long\r\nintervals; our need of air is felt unceasingly, always imperious,\r\nalways inexorable. Let any one try for a moment to prevent its\r\nadmission into the body by closing the entrance passages, the mouth and\r\nthe nostrils; almost immediately he is suffocated and feels that he\r\nwould surely die if this state were prolonged a little. And what is\r\ntrue of man is true of all forms of animal life: air is necessary to\r\nthem all, from the smallest to the greatest.\r\n\r\n“What I am going to tell you now will explain this absolute necessity\r\nfor air for the maintenance of life. Man and also every animal of a\r\nsuperior organization—a classification that includes mammals and\r\nbirds—have a temperature of their own, a degree of bodily heat peculiar\r\nto them, a heat resulting from no external conditions, but from the\r\nfunctions of life alone. Whether under a burning sun or in the freezing\r\ncold of winter, whether subjected to the torrid heat of the equator or\r\nto the glacial climate of the poles, man’s body has a temperature of\r\nthirty-eight degrees, centigrade, and cannot be lowered without danger\r\nof death. The natural heat of birds attains forty-two degrees in all\r\nseasons and in all climates.\r\n\r\n“How is it that this heat is always the same, and whence can it come\r\nunless from some sort of combustion? There is, in fact, going on within\r\nus a perpetual combustion, respiration furnishing the necessary air,\r\nand food supplying the fuel. To live is to consume oneself, in the\r\nstrictest sense of the word; to breathe is to burn. In a figurative\r\nsense man has long used the expression ‘the torch of life’; but this\r\nfigurative term proves to be the exact utterance of the truth. Air\r\nconsumes the torch; it consumes the animal no less; it makes the torch\r\ngive out heat and light, and it produces in the animal heat and motion.\r\nWithout air the torch goes out; without air the animal dies. From this\r\npoint of view the animal may be compared to a highly perfected machine\r\nput in motion by heat. It feeds and breathes to produce heat and\r\nmotion; it receives its fuel in the form of food and burns it in the\r\ninmost recesses of its body with the help of the air introduced by\r\nbreathing. That explains why the need of food is greater in winter than\r\nin summer, the body cooling off more rapidly by contact with the\r\noutside cold air, and consequently an increased consumption of fuel\r\nbeing required to maintain the normal temperature. A low temperature\r\ncreates a desire for food; a high temperature lessens the demand. To\r\nthe hungry Siberians hearty food is necessary; they ask for bacon and\r\nother fats, with brandy to drink. But for the people of Sahara a few\r\ndates suffice, with a pinch of flour kneaded in the palm of the hand\r\nwith a little water. Everything that lessens the loss of heat lessens\r\nalso the need of food. Sleep, rest, warm clothing, all serve to some\r\nextent as substitutes for food. And so there is much truth in the\r\nsaying that he who sleeps dines.”\r\n\r\n“That may be,” Jules assented, “but I don’t see how hedgehogs and bats\r\ncan do without food for four or five months at a time. No matter how\r\nsoundly I might sleep, I couldn’t go without eating so long as that.”\r\n\r\n“Wait until I finish, and for the present remember this: in every\r\nanimal life depends on an actual and never-ceasing combustion. Air, as\r\nnecessary to this combustion as to the burning of wood or coal in our\r\nstoves and fireplaces, is taken into the body by breathing. That is\r\nwhat makes breathing so urgent, so incessant. As to the fuel burned,\r\nthat is furnished by the substance of the animal itself, by the blood\r\nmade from digested food. Not a finger is lifted by us, not a muscle\r\nmoved, that does not use up just so much of the fuel furnished by the\r\nblood, which itself is made by the food we eat. Walking, running,\r\nworking, excitement, all forms of exercise or emotion—these literally\r\nburn up our blood just as a locomotive burns its coal in dragging\r\nbehind it the immense weight of a train. That is why activity, hard\r\nwork, increases our need for food, while rest, idleness, lessens it.\r\n\r\n“I will now put to you a question. Let us suppose that there are on the\r\nhearth some burning brands, but that they are few and small, and you\r\nwish to keep the fire as long as possible. Would you let these\r\nfirebrands burn freely? Would you take the bellows and blow air on them\r\nto increase the blaze?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Jules; “that would be just the way to burn up the brands\r\nin no time. They must be covered with ashes. If the air comes to them\r\nvery slowly and only a little at a time, they will burn gradually and\r\nthe next morning we shall find the coals still alive.”\r\n\r\n“That is well said, my boy. To keep up a fire for a long time with a\r\ngiven amount of fuel, the draft must be reduced, the access of air must\r\nbe largely cut off, but not intercepted altogether, because then the\r\nfire would be completely extinguished. Therefore the live coals are\r\nburied under ashes, and if the fire is in a stove the door of the\r\nash-pit is nearly closed. With plenty of air, combustion is active but\r\nof short duration; with only a little air it is feeble, but lasts a\r\nlong time.\r\n\r\n“As the maintenance of life is the result of a real combustion, any\r\nanimal obliged to endure a long fast, or in other words to dispense\r\nwith the regular renewal of the fuel needed in that combustion, must\r\ntake into its body as little air as possible. It must reduce the draft\r\nof its furnace. This draft is respiration, breathing; and so, in order\r\nto go without food for months at a time and to make the small amount of\r\nfuel held in reserve in the veins last as long as possible, the animal\r\nhas but one course to follow: it must breathe as little as it can\r\nwithout depriving itself entirely of air, for that would mean the total\r\nextinction of the vital spark, just as the complete cutting off of air\r\nfrom a lighted lamp means the speedy extinction of its flame. There you\r\nhave the hedgehog’s and the bat’s secret for enduring their long fast\r\nthrough the winter season.\r\n\r\n“First of all, every precaution is taken to avoid all loss, all\r\nunnecessary expenditure of heat, and to economize as much as possible\r\nthe reserves of fuel in their poor little veins. The hedgehog wraps\r\nitself up warm in a thick blanket of leaves in the heart of a\r\nstone-heap or in some hollow tree trunk, while the bats collect in\r\ncompact groups in the warm shelter of a deep cave. But that is not\r\nenough: they must keep quite still, as every movement uses up a certain\r\namount of heat. This requirement is scrupulously observed: their\r\nimmobility is such that you would say they were dead. And yet all this\r\nis still insufficient: respiration must be reduced to a minimum. In\r\nfact, their breathing is so weak that the closest scrutiny can hardly\r\ndetect that they breathe at all. This faint remnant of life is not to\r\nbe compared, you can well see, to the blazing torch or the brightly\r\nburning fire, both of which, enjoying free combustion, send out waves\r\nof heat and light. It is rather the feeble glimmer of a night lamp\r\nhusbanding its last drop of oil; it is the coal that glows faintly\r\nunder the ashes. So profound is the torpor, so nearly complete the\r\ninanition, that were it not followed by an awakening this state would\r\nhardly differ in any respect from death.\r\n\r\n“The name ‘hibernation’ is given to this temporary suspension of\r\nvitality, or rather this slowing up of life, to which certain animals\r\nare subject during the winter. In the number of hibernating animals, or\r\nanimals that indulge in this long winter sleep, are to be included,\r\nbesides the hedgehog and the bat, the marmot, the dormouse, the lizard,\r\nserpents of various kinds, frogs, and other reptiles. Do you need to be\r\ntold that in order to assume and maintain this torpid condition in\r\nwhich for whole months food is unnecessary, a special organization is\r\nrequired? Not every creature can hold its breath at will and thus\r\nescape the necessity of eating. The dog and the cat might sleep ever so\r\ndeeply, yet as their breathing would go on almost as actively as in\r\ntheir waking hours, hunger would arouse them before long.”\r\n\r\n“Just as it would me,” said Emile.\r\n\r\n“No animals that have an assured supply of food for the winter\r\nhibernate, but those that would otherwise perish with hunger in cold\r\nweather are saved from destruction by the providential torpor that\r\novertakes them at the approach of the winter season. Their food supply\r\nbeing cut off, they go to sleep. The marmot is wrapped in slumber while\r\nthe turf on the high mountains is covered with snow; the dormouse when\r\nthere is no longer any fruit; frogs, toads, snakes, lizards, bats, and\r\nhedgehogs, as soon as there cease to be any more insects to feed upon.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE MOLE\r\n\r\n\r\nUncle Paul had just trapped a mole that for some days had been\r\nuprooting young vegetables and unearthing newly planted seeds in a\r\ncorner of the garden. He called the children’s attention to the\r\nanimal’s black coat, softer than the finest velvet; showed them its\r\nsnout and made them note its peculiar fitness for digging; pointed to\r\nits fore paws, shaped like wide shovels for moving the earth with\r\nastonishing rapidity; and remarked on its eyes, so small as to be\r\nwell-nigh useless, and its jaws armed with savage-looking teeth.\r\n\r\n“It is a great pity,” said he, “that we are prejudiced against the mole\r\non account of its habit of mining, for there is not in all the world a\r\nmore pitiless destroyer of vermin.”\r\n\r\n“I had always heard,” Louis remarked, “and had believed until now, that\r\nmoles lived on a vegetable diet, chiefly of roots, and that they\r\ntunneled under the ground to get them.”\r\n\r\n“To forewarn you of the errors so widely current on the subject of the\r\ndiet of certain animals, I described to you in some detail the\r\nformation of teeth, which always indicate the kind of food eaten. I\r\nshowed you that one has only to examine an animal’s teeth in order to\r\ndetermine whether it is carnivorous or herbivorous. Remember the adage\r\nthat summed up our talks on the subject: Show me its teeth and I will\r\ntell you what the animal eats.\r\n\r\n“The mole is a good illustration: it has forty-four sharply pointed\r\nteeth, not including the incisors. Do they look like millstones for the\r\nleisurely grinding of grain and roots, or sharp tools for making\r\nmincemeat of torn flesh?”\r\n\r\n“They are certainly the teeth of an animal that lives on prey,” Louis\r\nadmitted; “the hedgehog and the bat haven’t sharper ones.”\r\n\r\n“To make you sure of this fact,” Uncle Paul went on, “I will tell you\r\nabout some experiments made on the diet of moles. We owe them to a\r\nlearned French naturalist, Flourens. If after you are grown up you ever\r\nhave a chance to read his remarkable works, you will find them very\r\ninteresting and valuable.\r\n\r\n“Flourens put two live moles into a cask and, believing them to be\r\nherbivorous, gave them for food a supply of roots, carrots, and\r\nturnips. As you see, the illustrious naturalist shared the accepted\r\nopinion, the false notion just repeated by Louis. But Flourens was soon\r\nundeceived. The next morning the vegetables were found untouched, while\r\none of the moles had been devoured by its companion and there was\r\nnothing left of it but the skin, turned inside out.”\r\n\r\n“One of the moles had eaten the other?” cried Emile. “Oh, what a fierce\r\ncreature!”\r\n\r\n“It had feasted on its own kind, a thing that hardly any other animal\r\ndoes. In devouring its comrade it had in the course of the night eaten\r\nits own weight of food; and yet the next morning it seemed restless and\r\nvery hungry. Flourens threw it a live sparrow whose wings he had just\r\nclipped. The mole smelt it, walked around it, received a few hard pecks\r\nfrom its beak, then, pouncing on the bird, tore its stomach open and\r\nenlarged the opening with its claws so as to plunge its head into the\r\nmidst of the entrails. With its pointed snout the horrible creature\r\nbored into them with frantic delight. In less than no time it had\r\ndevoured half the contents of the skin, which with its feathers was\r\nleft whole. Flourens then lowered into the cask a glass full of water\r\nand saw the mole stand up against the glass, cling to the edge with its\r\nfore claws, and drink eagerly. When it had had enough, the animal\r\nreturned to the sparrow, ate a little more of it, and finally,\r\ncompletely full, lay down to sleep in a corner. The glass and the\r\nremains of the bird were then taken out of the cask.\r\n\r\n“Hardly six hours later the mole, hungry again, began to smell around\r\nthe bottom of the cask in search of something to eat. A second sparrow\r\nwas thrown to it. The mole immediately tore open the stomach to get at\r\nits entrails. When it had eaten most of the bird and taken another big\r\ndrink of water, it appeared satisfied and remained quiet. This was its\r\nlast meal for the day. Just think, boys, what a quantity of reeking\r\nflesh it took to satisfy one mole’s hunger! In the night its companion\r\nin captivity, and the next day two sparrows! The weight of the food\r\neaten in twenty-four hours was nearly twice that of the eater.\r\n\r\n“Was the animal satisfied for long? By no means. The next morning the\r\nmole was wandering restlessly about in the bottom of its cask,\r\napparently wild with hunger. Food, quick, quick! or it will die of\r\nstarvation. The remains of the sparrow left over from the evening\r\nbefore, with a frog which it promptly disemboweled, quieted it for a\r\nwhile. Finally, a toad was thrown to it. As soon as the mole approached\r\nto rip it up the toad inflated its body, hoping perhaps to frighten the\r\nenemy with its repulsive appearance. At any rate, it succeeded. After\r\nsniffing at it, the mole turned away in disgust. Ah! you don’t want the\r\ntoad, you greedy creature; then you shall have turnips, cabbages, and\r\ncarrots. Plenty of these were given it. But fie on roots! Rather perish\r\nthan eat turnips! The next morning the mole was found to have starved\r\nto death amid the vegetables. It had scorned to touch them with so much\r\nas a tooth.\r\n\r\n“Had this animal an exceptional appetite, a taste for unusual things,\r\nthat it should have preferred to die of hunger rather than touch\r\nvegetable food? Not at all; it merely followed the preferences of all\r\nits kind. Many other experiments have been performed both by Flourens\r\nand by other observers. All the moles they have tried to feed with\r\nvegetable substances—with bread, lettuce, cabbages, roots, herbage of\r\nany description—have starved to death without touching their\r\nprovisions. On the other hand, those that were fed with raw flesh,\r\nworms, larvæ, and insects of various kinds, remained alive.\r\n\r\n“Another very simple way to determine positively the kind of food eaten\r\nby this animal is to examine the contents of its stomach as it lives in\r\nthe freedom of its customary haunts. Everything eaten by it must find\r\nits way to the stomach. Let us catch a mole, cut it open, and\r\ninvestigate. The stomach is found to contain, sometimes, red pieces of\r\ncommon earthworms, or it may be a pap of beetles, recognizable from the\r\nscaly remains that have not been digested; or still again, and rather\r\noftener, we find a marmalade of larvæ, especially the larvæ of\r\nJune-bugs—undigested bits of mandibles and the hard shell of the skull.\r\nIn short, one is likely to come upon a mixed hash of all the small\r\ncreatures inhabiting the soil, such as wood-lice, millipeds, cutworms,\r\nmoths in the chrysalis state, caterpillars, and subterranean nymphs;\r\nbut no matter how carefully we search we cannot find a bit of vegetable\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n“All possible observation points to the same conclusion: despite what\r\nis believed by so many it is certain that the mole’s diet is confined\r\nto animal substances. And could it, I ask you, be otherwise? Would the\r\nstomach’s contents belie the savage set of teeth you have just seen in\r\nthe picture? Do not its teeth show that it is a flesh-eater?\r\n\r\n“Yes, the mole eats flesh and nothing else; everything proves this.\r\nBesides, remember its big appetite, if one may call appetite the raging\r\ndemands of a stomach that in twelve hours requires a quantity of food\r\nequal to the weight of the animal. The mole’s existence is a gluttonous\r\nfrenzy. This frenzy seizes the creature three or four times a day, and\r\nit dies of starvation if it has to go without food for more than a few\r\nhours. To satisfy its appetite, when its food melts away and disappears\r\nalmost as soon as swallowed, what can the mole count on? Live sparrows,\r\nwhich it devoured with such zest in the experiments of Flourens, are\r\nevidently not for a hunter that burrows underground; at most, some\r\nstray frog, found in the field, may fall into its clutches. What, then,\r\nis left for it to count on? The larvæ buried underground, and\r\nespecially those of the June-bug, tender and fat as bacon. That is very\r\nlittle, I admit, for such hunger; but the number to be had will make up\r\nfor the smallness of the prey. What a slaughter of white worms must\r\ntake place when the soil abounds in this small game! Scarcely is one\r\nmeal finished when another begins, and each time, no doubt, other small\r\ninsects are eaten by the dozen. To free a field of these destroyers of\r\nour crops there is no helper equal to the mole.\r\n\r\n“A valued destroyer of vermin—that is what we defend when we take the\r\nmole’s part and give to it, even if somewhat reluctantly, the honorable\r\ntitle of helper. That title, in truth, it only partly deserves. To\r\ncatch the crickets, the larvæ, the white worms, and the insects of all\r\nkinds that it feeds on, the mole is obliged to disturb the roots amid\r\nwhich its prey is to be found. Many that interfere with it in its work\r\nare cut; plants have their roots laid bare and are even uprooted\r\naltogether; and, finally, the earth dug up by this untiring miner is\r\npiled on the surface in little mounds or mole-hills. With such\r\nupturning of the soil a field of vegetables may be speedily ruined and\r\na crop of grain badly damaged. One night is enough for a mole to\r\nundermine a large tract; for the famished creature is singularly quick\r\nin boring the soil where it hopes to find something to eat.\r\n\r\n“It is well equipped for making its underground galleries, which often\r\nare hundreds of meters long. The body is stubby and almost cylindrical\r\nfrom one end to the other, so as to slip with the least resistance\r\nthrough the narrow passages bored by the animal. The fur is short,\r\nthick, and carefully curried so that it shall not catch the dust and\r\nmay be kept perfectly clean even in the most dusty soil. The tail is\r\nvery short and the external ears are wanting, although the hearing is\r\nremarkably acute. Ears like those of animals that live in the open,\r\nwould be in the way underground; in the mole they are made very tiny,\r\nfor the animal’s greater convenience. No luxurious outfit does it ask\r\nfor, but only what is strictly necessary for its work of mining. Eyes\r\nwide open so that the dirt could get into them would be a perpetual\r\ntorment to the creature; and, besides, what use could it make of them\r\nin the total darkness of its abode? The mole is not exactly blind, as\r\nis generally believed; it has two eyes, but these are very small and\r\nset so deep in the surrounding fur that they can be of little use. It\r\nis guided by the sense of smell, in which it rivals the pig; and like\r\nthe pig it has a snout of the right shape for digging up a toothsome\r\nmorsel. With its snout the pig finds and roots out the savory titbit\r\nburied in the ground; the mole in like manner discovers and digs up the\r\nplump white worm. To reach it amid a network of roots and under a\r\nconsiderable thickness of soil, the animal has its fore paws, which\r\nspread out like large strong hands with exceptionally tough nails.\r\nThese hands—stout shovels which, if need be, can open a passage through\r\ntufa, a soft sort of rock—are the mole’s principal tools. As the animal\r\nadvances, digging with its snout and clearing away with its hands, the\r\nearth is thrown to the rear by its hind feet, which are much weaker\r\nthan the hands but strong enough for the far lighter task. If the mole\r\nproposes to return by the same road, the track must be kept clear;\r\naccordingly, the earth dug up is thrown outside to form mole-hills at\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\n“For the present these details will suffice. Now let us take up the\r\nmuch-discussed question of the mole’s usefulness. Should we,\r\nconsidering the undoubted services it renders us, let it live in our\r\nfields, or ought we rather, on account of its destructive digging, to\r\nlook upon it as an enemy and wage war on it? Most people seem to feel\r\nwe should make war on it—war to the death. Some persons make it a\r\npractice to destroy every mole they find and there is small pity\r\nbestowed upon the little creature unearthed by the spade. But I should\r\nlike to remind the mole’s pitiless enemies that insects do far worse\r\ndamage, and that for ridding a field of insects nothing is equal to\r\nthis bloodthirsty hunter. Notwithstanding all opinion to the contrary,\r\nI believe that moles in moderate numbers are needed in a field, that it\r\nis unwise to destroy them all. Indeed, experience has proved this. I\r\nknow of regions where the moles have been hunted down and destroyed\r\nuntil not one was left. Now, do you know what was the result? The white\r\nworms multiplied so that they ate up everything in the fields. To get\r\nrid of the worms it was necessary to let the moles come back and to let\r\nthem stay so long as they did not become too numerous.\r\n\r\n“And there is something else to be said for the mole. Mole-hills are\r\nformed of well-worked earth which, when spread about with the rake, is\r\nvery good for young grass. Further, the creature’s subterranean\r\ngalleries serve as drains for keeping the soil in a sanitary condition,\r\nletting off the extra water just as regular drains would do. On the\r\nwhole, then, after weighing the arguments on both sides, I am of the\r\nopinion that the mole ought not to be banished from our fields unless\r\nit multiplies to excess.”\r\n\r\n“And how about gardens?” queried Louis.\r\n\r\n“That is another question. In a few hours a mole can almost ruin a\r\ngarden. Who would want such a digger among his growing vegetables? You\r\ncarefully sow your seeds, set out your young plants, even off the\r\nground, and make water-channels; the very next morning—plague take the\r\ncreature! it has turned everything topsy-turvy. Quick, a spade, a trap,\r\nand let us get rid of the pest as soon as possible! Suppose, however,\r\nthat cutworms and other destructive vermin abound; shall we gain\r\nanything by killing the mole? Certainly not. The insects will speedily\r\ndo more harm than the mole has just wrought; greater mischief is in\r\nstore, and that is all there is about it. If I had a garden infested\r\nwith destructive insects, here is what I should do. In the spring I\r\nshould let loose in my garden half a dozen moles taken alive in the\r\nfield, and I should then leave them to pursue their hunting in peace.\r\nTheir work done, the ground cleaned, I should take the moles away.”\r\n\r\n“You can catch them whenever you want to?” asked Louis.\r\n\r\n“Nothing easier. You shall see for yourself.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE MOLE’S NEST—THE SHREW-MOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\n“All that you know of the mole’s labors is confined to the little\r\nmounds of earth, the mole-hills, that it throws up, and the tunnels, of\r\ngreater or less extent, that it bores just beneath the surface of the\r\nsoil. These tunnels are hunting-trails, made by the animal in order to\r\nsearch amid the roots for the larvæ it lives on. If the ground is full\r\nof game, the mole halts there, probing to right and left, wherever it\r\nsmells a grub. If the spot is a poor one it prolongs the tunnel or\r\nbores fresh ones hither and thither, in every direction, until it finds\r\na place to suit it. But, however abundant the larvæ may be, one vein is\r\nsoon exhausted, whereupon the old diggings are abandoned and fresh ones\r\nundertaken from day to day.\r\n\r\n“Near its hunting-ground, thus honeycombed with a succession of tunnels\r\nas called for, the mole has a burrow, a fixed abode, to which it\r\nretires to rest, sleep, and rear its young. This burrow is a work of\r\nart, a strong castle, in the making of which the cautious animal uses\r\ngreat skill, with a view to the utmost possible security. You must not\r\nthink I am talking about the mole-hills, which are merely the dirt\r\nthrown out in the digging. The mole is never to be found lurking\r\nbeneath these crumbling hillocks.\r\n\r\n“Its dwelling is something quite different. It is underground at a\r\ndepth of nearly a meter, usually beneath a hedge, or at the foot of a\r\nwall, or amid the big roots of some great tree. This natural shelter\r\nmakes it strong so that it will not cave in. Its main part is a chamber\r\n(c) shaped somewhat like an inverted bottle, carefully rough-coated\r\nwith loam and made smooth on the inside. It is furnished with a warm\r\nbed of moss and dry grass. That is the mole’s resting-place, its\r\nbedroom, the family nest. Two circular tunnels run around it at a\r\ndistance: the lower one (a) larger, the upper one (b) of lesser\r\ndiameter. They serve as sentry-posts for the safeguarding of the main\r\nchamber. Stationed in the upper tunnel, which is reached by three\r\npassages leading from the large chamber, the mole listens to what is\r\ngoing on outside. If some danger threatens, half a dozen exits are\r\nprovided for speedy descent to the lower tunnel, whence there are\r\nnumerous outlets for instant flight. These lead in all directions, but\r\nsoon bend back and into the main passage (p). If danger overtakes the\r\nmole in its inmost retreat (c), it escapes by the tunnel (h) which\r\nleads out from below, winds around, and rejoins the main passage (p).”\r\n\r\n“I get lost in all those tunnels and passages,” said Emile. “The mole’s\r\nhouse is very complicated.”\r\n\r\n“For us, perhaps, but not for the mole. It knows every twist and turn\r\nof these winding tunnels, and can get away at very short notice. You\r\nthink you can catch it in its home, but in a twinkling it is gone and\r\nyou don’t know in what direction.\r\n\r\n“The passages for flight, both those that go in all directions from the\r\nlower circular tunnel and those that run straight from the chamber, all\r\nlead finally into the passage marked p, the entrance-way to the mole’s\r\nabode; and this passage is the main one between the large chamber and\r\nthe hunting-ground, the permanent highway over which the mole passes to\r\nand fro three or four times a day—in fact every time it goes on an\r\nexpedition or returns home. This passage, meant to last as long as the\r\ndwelling remains in use, is much more carefully made than the simple\r\nburrows bored from day to day as the mole seeks its food: it is deeper\r\ndown, wider, smooth and well beaten; no mole-hill is over it; its\r\ncovering of earth is solid. Yet something betrays it to the searcher’s\r\neye. On account of the mole’s incessant comings and goings the roots of\r\nany plants growing there are more injured than are those over the\r\nordinary tunnels made by the animal; consequently, the grass has an\r\nunhealthy, yellowish look. Once this passage is known—and the strip of\r\nyellow grass points it out—the mole can be caught at any time. A trap\r\nis set inside the tunnel. Obliged to pass through either to get out or\r\nto come in, the mole cannot fail to be taken sooner or later.”\r\n\r\n“That is plain enough,” said Louis. “I see now how easy it would be to\r\ncatch moles again whenever you want to after they have been let loose\r\nin a garden to rid it of insects.”\r\n\r\n“To conclude my account of insectivorous animals,” Uncle Paul went on,\r\n“I will now tell you about the very smallest of mammals, a tiny\r\ncreature not more than two inches long. This cunning little animal\r\nlooks somewhat like a mouse, but is much smaller. The tail is shorter,\r\nthe head more tapering, and the nose ends in a sharper point. The ears\r\nare short and rounded. But the coat is almost the same as that of the\r\nmouse.\r\n\r\n“The shrew-mouse has the same tastes as the mole: it is an ardent\r\nhunter of small game, a devourer of larvæ and insects, as you can see\r\nby its finely serrate teeth. Its slender body, made for squeezing into\r\nthe smallest hole, and its long snout, shaped for prying into the\r\nnarrowest crannies and crevices, enable it to go wherever vermin may be\r\nlurking. Woe to the wood-louse rolled up like a tiny pellet in some\r\ncrack in the wall, and to the slug hiding under a stone! The\r\nshrew-mouse will have no difficulty in catching them, being so small\r\nthat it could make its home in a nutshell. It will not help them to\r\nhide, for the shrew-mouse does not need to see them in order to find\r\nthem. It detects them by its subtle sense of smell, and hears them if\r\nthey make the slightest movement. The burrows of the beetles, the\r\nwarrens of the larvæ, the lurking-places of the tiniest worms hold no\r\nsecrets from the shrew-mouse. It might be appropriately called the\r\ninsects’ ferret.\r\n\r\n“These little creatures are to be found in fields and meadows and\r\ngardens, and in winter they come near our houses and make their nests\r\nunder straw-stacks and dung-heaps. In very cold weather they even find\r\ntheir way into stables, where they live on cockroaches and wood-lice;\r\nbut at the approach of summer they are off again to the open fields,\r\nwhere they complete the mole’s work of extermination. Or they may seek\r\nsome garden, where they protect the wall-fruit and the vegetable\r\npatches from the devouring insect hordes without ever touching any of\r\nthe growing crops themselves. The teeth of the shrew-mouse are not made\r\nfor the chewing of vegetable food; like the mole, this tiny creature is\r\ncarnivorous. Moreover, in their hunting-raids, which are so greatly to\r\nour advantage, shrew-mice never do us the slightest injury of any sort,\r\nas they never bore tunnels, but merely use the natural cracks in the\r\nsoil. They cannot be reproached with severing roots or throwing up\r\nmounds of earth, as moles do; and yet they are perhaps more an object\r\nof general execration than the latter. It is considered a praiseworthy\r\nact to crush them every time one gets a chance.\r\n\r\n“How has so tiny, pleasing, and useful a creature managed thus to incur\r\nthe hatred of man? We have here, my children, another instance of the\r\nfoolish way we accept the first notion that enters our heads, without\r\ntrying to test it by observation and reason. It is said that the\r\nshrew-mouse bites horses’ feet and leaves incurable wounds. But how can\r\na shrew-mouse, whose head is at most no larger than a pea, bite a horse\r\nand pierce its hide which is the thickness of a finger or more? Again,\r\nthey say the shrew-mouse is venomous even for man. Some time ago,\r\nchildren, I told you about the viper. [2] You know what its weapons\r\nare,—two long, sharp teeth or fangs having little channels through\r\nwhich it introduces a drop of venom into the wound it inflicts. Well, I\r\nassure you the shrew-mouse has no weapon like the viper’s; it has\r\nneither fangs nor a poison-sac, but is wholly harmless to man and\r\nhorse. Insects alone need fear its fine teeth,—not that they are\r\npoisoned in any way, but because they crunch their little victims very\r\nneatly.\r\n\r\n“I think I see why the shrew-mouse has incurred the charge of being\r\nvenomous. The pretty little creature exhales an odor; it smells rather\r\nstrongly of musk. The cat, taking it for a mouse, sometimes chases it,\r\nbut, repelled by its odor, never eats it. The first to observe this\r\nfact said to himself: ‘As the cat does not dare eat it the shrew-mouse\r\nmust be venomous.’ Ever since then this false belief has passed for\r\ntruth in the country, and no one has taken the trouble to look into the\r\nmatter more closely; so that the poor little shrew-mouse, one of our\r\nmost useful and harmless helpers, falls a victim to the stupidity of\r\nman, whose gardens it protects.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE EXPLOIT OF ONE-EYED JOHN\r\n\r\n\r\nIt happened one day that One-eyed John caught an owl in his corn-crib,\r\nand he had just nailed the live bird to his house door as a bandit of\r\nthe worst kind, worthy to be exposed to the jeers of all who passed and\r\nto dry up on the spot so as to serve as a scarecrow.\r\n\r\nJohn was very proud of his deed; he laughed at the click-clacking of\r\nthe bird’s beak, at the desperate rolling of the eyes as the owl hung\r\nthere crucified. Its grimaces and contortions, the convulsive efforts\r\nof the wings to free themselves from the big nails that pierced them,\r\nand the fits of impotent rage expressed by the spasmodic working of the\r\ntalons put him in the best of humors.\r\n\r\nThe children of the neighborhood, cruel and heartless as is usual at\r\ntheir age, and still more cruel when grown persons set the sad example,\r\nhad gathered before the door and were joining in the laugh at the owl’s\r\nsufferings. John told them that his neighbor, old Annette, had died two\r\nweeks before because the owl came three times in quick succession and\r\nhooted on the roof of the house.\r\n\r\n“Those creatures,” said he, “are bad-luck birds. At night they fly into\r\nchurches and drink the oil out of the lamps; they perch on the roofs of\r\nsick people’s houses and foretell their death; and they snuggle into a\r\nhole in the belfry and laugh when the bell tolls for a funeral.”\r\n\r\nAll this of course frightened the children. “See,” said the youngest,\r\npressing close to his brother, “how the owl threatens us with its big\r\nred eyes; it must be awfully wicked.”\r\n\r\n“It’s so ugly,” said another, “let’s hurt it. That will teach it to\r\nlaugh when people die, and to drink oil out of the holy lamps. John,\r\nput its eyes out with this pointed stick, it looks at us so wickedly;\r\nand put this piece of glass in its claws so that it will cut its\r\nfingers.”\r\n\r\nAnd thus each one did what he could to harm the helpless creature; each\r\ntried to invent some new torture for it.\r\n\r\nJust then Louis happened to come along, and the children called to him\r\nto join them in tormenting the owl. More merciful than his comrades,\r\nespecially since he had fallen into the way of visiting Uncle Paul’s\r\nhouse, Louis turned his eyes away from this frightful spectacle and\r\nbegged John to end the bird’s agony instead of making it suffer still\r\nfurther tortures. But the boy’s entreaties were all in vain, and he\r\nwent away much distressed.\r\n\r\nAs he was going home he recalled something Uncle Paul had said in one\r\nof his talks; he had told the boys that when the ignorant crowd agrees\r\nto call a thing black it is always well to see whether after all the\r\nthing may not be white.\r\n\r\n“Here is One-eyed John,” said Louis to himself, “One-eyed John, known\r\nall about here for his ignorance; he has never in his life opened a\r\nbook, and he glories in the fact; he can’t sign his name; and he\r\nrejects with mulish obstinacy every wise suggestion. At this very\r\nmoment he is urging on the children against that poor owl he has just\r\nnailed to his door, and to make them think there is some reason why he\r\nshould be so cruel he tells them it is a graveyard bird, a bad-luck\r\nbird that brings misfortune to people. According to his account the owl\r\nis an evil creature, full of malice, and deserves no pity. We must\r\npunish it for its wickedness, make it suffer torments as an example to\r\nothers of its kind, and put it to death without mercy. But what if just\r\nthe opposite of all this should be true? What if the owl were really a\r\nharmless creature or even a very useful one and worthy of our\r\nprotection? I must find out.”\r\n\r\nAccordingly, that evening at Uncle Paul’s this was the first thing he\r\nasked about. At Louis’s description of the tortured owl Uncle Paul at\r\nonce recognized its species.\r\n\r\n“The bird that John thought he must nail alive to his door,” said he,\r\n“is the belfry-owl, also called the barn-owl. The unfortunate creature\r\nin no way deserved the frightful treatment it received. I pity it for\r\nhaving fallen into hands made cruel by ignorance. Stupidity and malice\r\ngo together, they say; and it is very true. He who is ignorant is\r\ndeliberately cruel. Wild and foolish things are said against the\r\nbarn-owl, and John repeated them. Having heard them from some one else,\r\nhe now, in his turn, passes them on to the street urchins who were so\r\neager to put out the bird’s eyes. It is not true that the barn-owl\r\nflies into churches and drinks the oil from the lamp that is kept\r\nlighted night and day in the sanctuary; it is not true that it laughs\r\nwhen it hears the passing-bell; it is not true that its hooting on the\r\nroof of a house means that some one in the house will soon die. False\r\nare all the sayings about its evil influence and its predictions of\r\nmisfortune, and any one who believes these absurd stories simply shows\r\nthat he has no common sense. We are in God’s hands, my children, and\r\nGod alone knows when our last hour is to come. Let us pity those\r\nfeeble-minded persons who believe the owl knows this tremendous secret;\r\nlet us pity them, but never let us abuse our reasoning powers by\r\nbelieving that an owl, in expressing after its own fashion, on some\r\nhouse-roof, its satisfaction at having caught a mouse, is solemnly\r\nforetelling what is going to happen. Uncle Paul’s nephews must\r\nhenceforth pay not the slightest attention to any such superstitious\r\nnotions. Let us go on.\r\n\r\n“What would you say of John if he had taken it into his head to kill\r\nhis cat by nailing the animal to the door by its fore paws?”\r\n\r\n“I should say,” answered Louis, “that if rats ever ate him up it would\r\nserve him right.”\r\n\r\n“What you saw him doing amounts to about the same thing: he was\r\ntorturing one of the very best destroyers of mice, a bird in form, a\r\ncat in habits. The barn-owl went into the corn-crib to guard the poor\r\nman’s wheat from rats, and John, a prey to superstitious hatred and\r\nnever thinking of the service the owl was doing him, made haste to nail\r\nthe useful bird to his door.\r\n\r\n“What strange wrong-headedness is it that makes us all, as a rule,\r\ndestroy the animals that help us most? Almost all our helpers are\r\npersecuted. Their good will must be very strong, else our ill treatment\r\nwould long ago have driven them forever from our dwellings and fields.\r\nBats rid us of a host of enemies, but none the less we look upon them\r\nwith dislike. The mole and the shrew-mouse purge the soil of vermin,\r\nand we dislike them, too. The hedgehog makes war on vipers and white\r\nworms, and we make war on him. The owl and various other night-birds\r\nare fine rat-hunters, but that does not save them from mistreatment.\r\nStill other animals that I will tell you about later do the most useful\r\nwork for us, and we persecute them all. They are ugly, people say, and\r\nfor no other reason they are killed. But, blind slayers, shall you not\r\nat last have your eyes opened to the fact that because of an\r\nunreasonable dislike you have sacrificed your own defenders? You\r\ncomplain of rats—and you nail the owl to your door, where you let its\r\ncarcass dry up, a hideous trophy! You complain of the white worms—and\r\nyou crush the mole every time the spade brings one to light. You rip up\r\nthe hedgehog and set your dogs on him just for fun. You complain of the\r\nravages of moths in your granaries, and if a bat falls into your hands\r\nyou seldom spare it. You complain, and yet you mistreat all the animals\r\nthat offer to help you. Blind you are and sadly misguided in your\r\nwanton cruelty.\r\n\r\n“Regarded merely as it affects his own interests, it is a pitiful piece\r\nof work that John has done, but it is far more pitiful in respect to\r\nthe tortures he has inflicted on the bird. It is not the mark of a man\r\nbut of a brute to take pleasure in torturing an animal. It is a wicked\r\nact and one that good men despise; ignorance is the cause of the act,\r\nbut ignorance is not an excuse. If an animal is harmful to us, let us\r\nget rid of it by killing it, but let us never think of inflicting\r\nneedless pain, of causing suffering simply for suffering’s sake. That\r\nwould be to smother in ourselves one of the noblest of sentiments,\r\ncompassion; it would mean the arousing of savage instincts, which too\r\noften lead to crime. He who finds his pleasure in torturing dumb\r\nanimals cannot take pity on the suffering of his own kind; his heart is\r\nhardened and prone to evil. How I pity those poor children who stood by\r\nand laughed at the barn-owl’s horrible sufferings, and who, led on by\r\nthe man’s example, helped to put out the wretched bird’s eyes! How I\r\npity them! Let them beware, let their parents take heed, for there is a\r\nbad streak in them.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nNOCTURNAL BIRDS OF PREY\r\n\r\n\r\n“The barn-owl, the horned owl, the gray owl, the white owl, and other\r\nsimilar birds are known under the general name of nocturnal birds of\r\nprey. They are called birds of prey because they live by hunting game\r\nof various sorts, especially such rodents as rats and mice. They are\r\namong birds what the cat is among mammals, untiring destroyers of those\r\nfur-covered creatures of which the mouse is the most familiar example\r\nto you. Our language has long since taken note of this resemblance in\r\nhabits by coining the name chat-huant [hooting cat], which is applied\r\nto some of these birds. They are cats that fly, that hoot, or, in other\r\nwords, that utter cries like mournful howls of distress. Also, they are\r\nnocturnal; that is, they remain during the day in some obscure\r\nhiding-place, which they leave only at nightfall to hunt in the\r\ntwilight and moonlight.\r\n\r\n“Their eyes are very large and round and are placed in the front of the\r\nhead instead of one on each side. A wide ring of fine feathers\r\nencircles each eye. The need for these enormous eyes is plainly seen in\r\nthe birds’ nocturnal habits. Being obliged to seek their food in a very\r\nfeeble light, they must, in order to see with any distinctness, have\r\neyes that admit as much light as possible; that is, the eyes must be\r\nsuch as can open wide.\r\n\r\n“But this development of the organs of sight, so useful in the\r\nnight-time, is a serious inconvenience in the bright light of day.\r\nDazzled, blinded by the sun’s rays, the bird of darkness stays in some\r\nsafe hole and dares not come out. If obliged to issue forth, it does so\r\nwith extreme caution for fear of hurting itself. It wings its way with\r\nhesitation and in short slow flights. Other birds, birds of the day,\r\nseeing its uncertainty and awkwardness, come and vie with one another\r\nin offering insults to the clumsy stranger. The redbreast and the\r\ntomtit are among the first to hasten to the scene, followed by the\r\nfinch, the blackbird, the jay, the thrush, and many others. Perched on\r\na branch, the night-bird receives the aggressors with a grotesque\r\nbalancing of its body, turning its big head this way and that in a\r\nridiculous manner and rolling its great eyes as if thinking thus to\r\nterrify its persecutors. But all in vain. The smallest and weakest are\r\nthe boldest in tormenting it; they assault their victim with beak and\r\nclaw, pulling out its feathers before the hapless bird can muster\r\ncourage to defend itself.”\r\n\r\n“Just think,” said Emile, “of a teasing tomtit and a saucy redbreast\r\nmaking sport of an owl blinded by the sun! Why do they behave so?”\r\n\r\n“From motives of revenge. The owl loses no opportunity to gobble up\r\nthose little birds in the night, and shows no more compunction over it\r\nthan if they were nothing but common mice. Therefore what a frolic it\r\nis for the little winged people when by good luck the night-bird strays\r\ninto the light of day! The pecks fall thick as hail on the sufferer’s\r\nback, and it is nearly deafened with shrill screams of triumph and\r\ninsulting cries of hatred. The redbreast pulls out a feather, the\r\ntomtit threatens the enemy’s eyes, the jay overwhelms it with abuse.\r\nThe whole grove is in an uproar. But beware when night closes in; then\r\nthe boldest will lose courage. These same saucy little birds, that come\r\nin the daytime and insult the owl, flee from it in wild alarm as soon\r\nas darkness allows it to move about and use its powerful talons and\r\nhooked beak.”\r\n\r\n“The redbreast had better get out of the owl’s way when the owl can\r\nsee,” said Emile; “it would pay dearly if it tried then to pull out a\r\nfeather.”\r\n\r\n“On account of the great size of their eyes, nocturnal birds of prey\r\nrequire a soft light like that of dawn and nightfall. Consequently,\r\nthey leave their lurking-places to hunt for prey either soon after\r\nsunset or just before dawn. Then it is that their raids are most likely\r\nto be successful, for they find the small animals either fast asleep or\r\non the point of falling asleep. Moonlight nights are the best for their\r\npurposes; those are their nights of veritable joy and feasting, when\r\nthey can hunt for hours at a time and lay in large supplies of choice\r\nprovisions. But when there is no moon they have only one scant hour in\r\nthe early morning and another in the evening for hunting. That means\r\nthey must fast for hours and that is why they are so greedy when they\r\ncan get as much food as they want.”\r\n\r\n“They are very silly to fast like that,” Emile declared. “In their\r\nplace I should hunt all night, even without a moon.”\r\n\r\n“You say that because you think the owl can see clearly in the blackest\r\ndarkness. But you are mistaken. To see, we must not merely direct our\r\ngaze toward the object to be seen; we must receive into our eyes the\r\nlight reflected from that object. In the act of seeing, nothing goes\r\nout from us; everything comes to us from the thing seen. We do not\r\nreally throw our glance toward any given object; it is the object that\r\nthrows its light toward us; or if it does not throw any light, it is\r\nfor that reason invisible. What I am now saying about human beings\r\napplies to all animals. Not one, absolutely not one, can see in the\r\nabsence of light.”\r\n\r\n“I had always thought,” said Louis, “that cats could see in\r\npitch-darkness.”\r\n\r\n“Others think so too, but they are much mistaken. The cat can no more\r\ndistinguish objects, if light is totally lacking, than any other\r\ncreature can. It has an advantage over us, I grant you: it has large\r\neyes, the pupils of which it can contract and almost close when it\r\nfinds itself exposed to a bright light that would otherwise dazzle it,\r\nor open wide to receive more of the feeble light diffused in a dark\r\nroom. These large eyes enable it to find its way in places which to us,\r\nwith our poorer sight, seem pitch-dark. But in reality the darkness is\r\nnot complete where a cat can manage to see well enough for its\r\npurposes. If light is totally lacking, the cat may open its eyes as\r\nwide as possible, but it will see nothing, absolutely nothing. In this\r\nparticular, nocturnal birds do not differ from the cat: their large\r\neyes, made for seeing in a dim light, can see nothing whatever when the\r\nnight is perfectly dark.\r\n\r\n“Now let us follow the bird in its hunt. The night is a fine one for\r\nhunting; the air is calm, the moon shining. The hunt begins with a\r\nlugubrious war-cry. At that dreaded signal the tomtit hardly feels safe\r\neven in the deepest hollow of its tree, the redbreast trembles beneath\r\nits shelter of thick foliage, and the finch loses its head with fright.\r\nGod of the weak, God of the little birds, protect them now! Make the\r\nowl, enraged as it still is from the insults of the day, miss them in\r\nits search! Blessed be Thy holy name if the rapacious bird turns in\r\nsome other direction! It skirts the groves and skims over the open\r\nplain and the plowed fields. It inspects the furrows where the\r\nfield-mouse crouches, the stretches of grass-land where the mole\r\nburrows, the tumble-down buildings in which rats and mice scamper to\r\nand fro. Its flight is silent, its soft wings cleaving the air without\r\nmaking the slightest sound to awaken its intended victims. This\r\nnoiselessness of flight is due to the structure of the bird’s feathers,\r\nwhich are soft as silk and of finest texture. Nothing gives warning of\r\nits sudden coming: the prey is seized even before it has suspected the\r\nnearness of the enemy. The owl, on the contrary, with its exceptional\r\nacuteness of hearing, is kept informed of all that is going on in the\r\nneighborhood, its large, deep ears detecting even the rustle of a\r\nfield-mouse in the grass. If the mouse begins to nibble a rootlet or a\r\ngrain of wheat, the bird hears the sound of its incisors and pounces on\r\nit immediately.\r\n\r\n“The prey is seized by two strong claws warmly gloved in down as far as\r\nthe roots of the nails. Each foot has four toes, three pointing\r\nhabitually forward, and one backward; but, by a privilege peculiar to\r\nnocturnal birds of prey, one of the front toes is movable and can be\r\nturned back so that the set of talons is divided into two pairs of\r\nequal power whenever the bird wishes to grip, as in a vise, the branch\r\non which it perches, or the victim struggling in its grasp. One blow of\r\nthe beak breaks the head of the captured creature. This beak is short\r\nand very hooked. The two mandibles move with great ease, which enables\r\nthem, in striking against each other, to give out a sharp rattling\r\nsound or clicking by which the bird expresses anger or fright. They\r\nstretch wide at the moment of swallowing, exposing a big opening\r\nleading into a very large gullet. When they are thus opened, the prey,\r\nwhich has already been kneaded into a compact mass between the claws,\r\ndisappears entirely as if swallowed up by an abyss. All goes down,\r\nincluding bones and hair. Not a trace is left of the field-mouse, not\r\neven its coat of fur. But a single victim is seldom enough, and so the\r\nhunt continues. More mice follow the first one, and all are first\r\nkilled by a peck on the head, all are swallowed whole. If the bird\r\nchances upon a fat beetle, he does not disdain it. It is a small\r\nmouthful, to be sure, but highly flavored with spices that will aid\r\ndigestion. At last, having eaten all it possibly can, the owl returns\r\nto its lodging in the hollow of some rock, or in a decayed tree trunk,\r\nor in some ruined building.\r\n\r\n“Now follows digestion. Motionless in the quiet of its peaceful\r\nsolitude, the bird gently closes its eyes to dream of the fine exploits\r\nit has just achieved and to plan others for the following night. Its\r\nslumbers are deep and long. In the meantime the stomach does its work.\r\nThe food swallowed without any preparation or sorting must be divided\r\ninto two parts, that which is really nutritious and that which is\r\nworthless. With the aid of its gastric juice the stomach carefully\r\nseparates the bones and skins from the nutritious part of its contents.\r\nThe flesh thus made semi-fluid disappears, to be converted into blood,\r\nand a confused mass remains, composed of skins turned inside out and\r\nwearing all their fur, bones as clean as if they had been scraped with\r\na knife, and the hard wing-covers of beetles. This bulky mass could not\r\nbe passed on by the stomach without danger. How then will the bird get\r\nrid of it? Let us watch and find out. Ah, the owl is waking up!\r\nGrotesque heavings of the body denote trouble within. The disturbance\r\nincreases, something ascends through the outstretched neck, the beak\r\nopens, and it is all over: there drops to the ground a ball containing\r\nskins, bones, scales, fur, feathers—in fact, the entire mass of\r\nindigestible matter.\r\n\r\n“All nocturnal birds of prey practise this undignified method of\r\nfreeing the stomach: they throw up in a ball the rejected remnants of\r\nwhat they have swallowed whole. If you ever find yourself near an owl’s\r\nretreat, examine the ground beneath it: the balls of little bones and\r\nhair will tell you from how many mice and other rodents of all kinds\r\nthese birds deliver us.”\r\n\r\n“I have seen some of those balls near a rock all white with bird-dung,”\r\nsaid Louis.\r\n\r\n“Some owl certainly lived there. It was responsible for the dung and\r\nthe balls of refuse that you saw.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nRATS\r\n\r\n\r\n“Let us return for a moment to the rodents, the habitual prey of the\r\nnight-birds. You do not know them all, by any means, but we ought not\r\nto pass them by; for if some, like the hare and the rabbit, are useful\r\nto us, still more are very destructive. You remember those two pairs of\r\nincisors, so long and sharp, that I told you about when I described the\r\nrabbit’s teeth. All rodents have similar incisors. To keep them sharp\r\nand prevent them from overlapping too much by growing too long, which\r\nwould make it impossible for the animal to feed itself, the rodent must\r\nwear them down by constant friction as fast as they grow. Consequently,\r\nthese terrible incisors have, so to speak, no rest; they must always be\r\nnibbling something, no matter what. Thus the harm they do us is much\r\ngreater than you would suspect from the size of the animal. How much\r\nactual food does a mouse need for one meal? Very little,\r\nunquestionably. A mouse is so small that a single nut will fill its\r\nstomach. Don’t think, however, that one day’s ravages are confined to\r\nthat one nut. After the nut is eaten, the animal will proceed, perhaps,\r\nto gnaw a hole in a bag, reduce a piece of cloth to tatters, chew up a\r\nbook, or drill a hole in a board, simply and solely to whet its teeth.\r\nAnd the damage caused by rats and mice in our dwelling-houses is\r\nmatched by other damage caused by other rodents in the fields. You must\r\nmake the acquaintance of all these destroyers.”\r\n\r\n“For my part,” Jules confessed, “I shouldn’t, if I saw it, know the\r\nfield-mouse that you told us about in your talk on night-birds.”\r\n\r\n“I know rats and mice such as we have in the house,” said Emile, “but\r\nthat’s all.”\r\n\r\n“And yet,” rejoined his uncle, “I very much doubt whether you have any\r\nreal knowledge of the rat. I will begin with it.\r\n\r\n“The common or black rat is more than twice the size of a mouse. Its\r\ncoat is nearly black above, and ashy gray underneath. It lives in\r\ngranaries, thatched roofs, and abandoned ruins. If it fails to find a\r\nlodging to its taste, it burrows a hole for itself. It is not a native\r\nwith us, but is thought to have come from Asia in the wake of the\r\narmies returning from the Crusades. To-day the common rat is seldom\r\nmentioned in our country; another foreign rodent has come in, the\r\nNorway or brown rat, which, being larger than the common rat, has waged\r\nwar against it and almost wiped out the species. We have not gained by\r\nthe exchange; quite the contrary, the Norway rat being a much more\r\ntroublesome creature. The true rat, the black rat, is rare now,\r\nespecially where the other abounds; and that is why I doubt that any\r\none of you is familiar with it. What you call a rat is more than likely\r\nto be one of these Norwegian invaders. Don’t forget the color—black—and\r\nyou will have no difficulty in recognizing the true rat.\r\n\r\n“The mouse is much more familiar to you. It has been known from the\r\nearliest times all over the world. Need I describe this little rodent,\r\nso well known for its liveliness, its wily nature, and its extreme\r\ntimidity, which makes it scuttle away to its hole at the slightest\r\nalarm?”\r\n\r\n“We all know the mouse very well,” Jules assured him.\r\n\r\n“The Norway or brown rat, also known as the sewer-rat, is the largest\r\nand most troublesome of all European rats. It attains a length of\r\nnearly a foot, without counting the tail, which is scaly like the\r\nmouse’s and a little shorter than the body. The largest and strongest\r\nNorway rat can cope with a cat. Its presence in Europe dates only from\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century, and it seems to have been brought\r\nfrom India in the hold of ships, which it commonly infests. It has now\r\nspread all over the world. Its coat is reddish brown above and ashy\r\ngray underneath.\r\n\r\n“Norway rats frequent storehouses, cellars, sewers, slaughter-houses,\r\nand dumping grounds. Everything is food to these filthy and audacious\r\ncreatures, and they even dare to attack a sleeping man. In large towns\r\nthey multiply so fast as to cause serious alarm. The vicinity of the\r\nslaughter-house of Montfaucon in Paris is so undermined with their\r\ninnumerable burrows that the buildings there are in danger of\r\ncollapsing. To preserve them from this disaster it is necessary to\r\nprotect their foundation against the attacks of the rodents by means of\r\na deep enclosing belt of broken glass bottles.”\r\n\r\n“What attracts them in such numbers to these places?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“The abundance of food, the dead bodies of slaughtered horses. In one\r\nnight, if left in the slaughter-house yards, dead horses are devoured\r\nto the skeleton. During severe frosts if the skin is not removed in\r\ntime the Norway rats get inside the body, stay there, and eat all the\r\nflesh, so that when a thaw comes and the workmen begin to skin the\r\nanimal, they find inside the skin nothing but a host of rats swarming\r\namong the bare bones.”\r\n\r\n“But don’t the people there have any cats to protect them?” asked\r\nEmile.\r\n\r\n“Cats! The Norway rats would eat them alive, my boy, in no time. They\r\nhave something better, however—dogs, both terriers and bulldogs, that\r\nrun the rats down in the sewers with astonishing cleverness and break\r\ntheir back with one bite. The bulldog—that’s the kind of cat you need\r\nfor such mice. This hunt in the sewer, moreover, must be frequently\r\nrepeated, for Norway rats multiply with frightful rapidity, and if we\r\nwere not careful the town would sooner or later be endangered; the\r\nhorrible creature, strong in its numbers, would devour all Paris. In\r\nDecember of the year 1849 two hundred and fifty thousand rats were\r\ndestroyed in a few days as the result of a single hunt.\r\n\r\n“In the country the Norway rat frequents the banks of foul streams; it\r\nenters kitchens through sink-holes; it gets into hen-houses and\r\nrabbit-warrens by undermining the walls. It haunts cellars and stables,\r\nbut rarely makes its way into high granaries, doubtless because of its\r\nliking for filthy drainage and any kind of offal, which can be found\r\nonly on ground floors and in basements. It pounces upon eggs and young\r\nfowls, and even has the boldness to suck the blood of full-grown\r\npoultry and rabbits. When it cannot get animal food, which is its first\r\nchoice, it will eat grain and vegetables of all kinds. No sort of food\r\nis rejected by this filthy glutton. To get rid of it you can hardly\r\ncount on the cat, for usually pussy is afraid to attack it. Nor are\r\nnight-birds strong enough to battle with it, except the eagle-owl,\r\nwhich does not abound in any numbers. The trap and poison are our only\r\nremaining means of overcoming this redoubtable foe.\r\n\r\n“The field-mouse is a little larger than the ordinary mouse. Its coat,\r\nwhich closely resembles that of the Norway rat, is reddish brown above\r\nand white underneath. Its eyes are large and prominent, its ears nearly\r\nblack, and its feet white. Its tail, which is very long, like that of\r\nthe common mouse, is thinly covered with hair and is black toward the\r\nend. The field-mouse frequents woods, hedges, fields, and gardens. It\r\ncuts down the stalks of grain to get at the ears, of which it nibbles a\r\nfew kernels and wastefully scatters the rest. In its quest for food it\r\nunearths newly planted seeds, takes a taste of the young shoots that\r\nhave just come up, gnaws the bark of shrubs, and feasts on growing\r\nvegetables. Its ravages are all the more serious because it lays up\r\nprovisions against a time of need. In storage chambers more than a foot\r\nunderground, beneath some tree trunk or rock, it collects grain,\r\nhazelnuts, acorns, almonds, and chestnuts, often going a considerable\r\ndistance to get them. One such store-room is not enough; it must have\r\nseveral, for it has a way of foolishly forgetting where its treasure is\r\nburied. In winter the field-mouse ventures to approach our houses and\r\nmakes its way into our cellars where fruit and vegetables are kept, or\r\nit establishes itself in great numbers in our granaries.\r\n\r\n“The dwarf rat or harvest-mouse is the smallest rodent of France. It is\r\na graceful creature, smaller than the common mouse, and of a yellowish\r\ntawny color, which is brighter on the rump than elsewhere; but the\r\nbelly, breast, and throat are a beautiful white, and the tail and feet\r\na light yellow. The ears, which stand out but very little beyond the\r\nfur of the head, are rounded and hairy, and the eyes are prominent. The\r\ndwarf rat lives exclusively in grain-fields and feeds on grain. After\r\nthe harvest it takes refuge in the stacks of grain, especially in\r\noat-stacks, but is never bold enough to enter houses. I am telling you\r\nabout this pretty little rodent not so much because I begrudge it the\r\nfew grains of oats it steals from us as because I wish to acquaint you\r\nwith its nest.\r\n\r\n“Other rats rear their young either in a hole in a rock or a wall or in\r\na burrow dug for the purpose. The harvest-mouse, however, scorns these\r\nstifling quarters; it must have an aërial nest like that built by\r\nbirds. So it brings together several wheat-stalks as they stand in the\r\nfield, interlaces them with bits of straw, and builds, half-way up from\r\nthe ground, a nest as beautifully made as any bird’s. This nest is\r\nspherical, interwoven with leaves on the outside and padded with moss\r\non the inside. It has only one little side opening, through which the\r\nrain cannot enter. Suspended at the height of several feet on the\r\nflexible support of the grain stalks, it swings to and fro with the\r\nslightest wind.”\r\n\r\n“How, then,” asked Emile, “does the little mouse manage to get in and\r\nout of its nest?”\r\n\r\n“It climbs up one of the stalks, being so small that this serves it\r\nperfectly as a ladder.”\r\n\r\n“If I ever come across a harvest-mouse I sha’n’t have the heart to do\r\nit any harm. It may go on eating oats in its pretty little nest, for\r\nall I care; I sha’n’t try to stop it.”\r\n\r\n“Here,” concluded Uncle Paul, “I will end my account of the chief\r\nrepresentatives of the rat family in these regions. They are five in\r\nnumber: the black rat, the mouse, the Norway rat, the field-mouse, and\r\nthe harvest-mouse.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nMEADOW-MICE [3]—HAMSTERS—DORMICE\r\n\r\n\r\n“Another kind of rodent now calls for our attention: it is the family\r\nof meadow-mice, commonly confounded with rats. Meadow-mice are easily\r\nrecognized by their short, slightly hairy tail.\r\n\r\n“The meadow-mouse is about as large as a common mouse. Its coat is of a\r\nyellowish hue mixed with gray above and dirty white underneath. The\r\ntail is only one-quarter as long as the body. The eyes are large and\r\nprominent, the ears rounded, hairy, and standing out but little from\r\nthe fur. The head is large and less pointed than that of the ordinary\r\nmouse.\r\n\r\n“In its rapid and abundant breeding the meadow-mouse is one of the\r\nfarmer’s chief foes. It overruns grain-fields especially, cutting down\r\nthe stalks to nibble the ears. After harvest it attacks clover roots,\r\ncarrots, potatoes, and the products in general of our kitchen-gardens.\r\nIn winter it digs under the furrows to eat the seeds sown there. If the\r\nsoil is so frost-bound as not to permit it to reach the buried seed, it\r\nretires to the stacks of grain, where it does great damage. It never\r\nmakes its way into our dwellings. Meadow-mice appear to emigrate from\r\none country to another in colonies when the country they have ravaged\r\ncan no longer supply them with food; at any rate, from time to time,\r\nonce or twice in a decade, they suddenly appear in countless droves\r\nthat are a real scourge to the country visited. The best destroyers of\r\nthese creatures are nocturnal birds of prey, as is proved by the\r\npresence of their skulls, bones, and skins in the balls that are thrown\r\nup by these birds after digestion. Some say diurnal birds of prey,\r\nbuzzards in particular, are equally fond of them. It is not at all\r\nuncommon to find in a buzzard’s crop as many as ten or more\r\nmeadow-mice.\r\n\r\n“The underground meadow-mouse is much less common in France than the\r\none just described, from which it differs in its gray-and-blackish\r\ncoat, its somewhat smaller tail, and its tiny eyes. But the greatest\r\ndifference is in its habits. The first-mentioned lives in the fields,\r\nespecially in grain-fields, while the second frequents meadows and\r\nkitchen-gardens. It feeds on various kinds of vegetables, such as\r\ncelery, artichokes, carrots, potatoes, and cardoons. It seldom shows\r\nitself out of its underground tunnels, and on account of its habit of\r\nlurking beneath the surface it is called the underground meadow-mouse.\r\n\r\n“The amphibian meadow-mouse is commonly known by the name of water-rat.\r\nWe can easily tell it from the black rat, which is of about the same\r\nsize, by its red coat, its short tail (which is not quite half the\r\nlength of its body), and its larger and less pointed head. It burrows\r\nunder the banks of streams, ditches, and marshes, where it feeds\r\nchiefly on roots, but does not disdain small fish when it can catch\r\nthem. It is a good swimmer and diver. Sometimes it makes its way into\r\nkitchen-gardens, where it does the same sort of harm as the underground\r\nmeadow-mouse, and into orchards, where it gnaws the base of young\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n“The lemming is never seen around here. It frequents the coasts of the\r\nArctic Ocean in Norway and Lapland. I will tell you something about it\r\non account of its curious way of traveling from one country to another,\r\nof which our meadow-mouse offers us a far less striking example. The\r\nlemming, with its very short and hairy tail, its big head, and its\r\nstocky body, has the appearance of a small rabbit. Its coat is red\r\nmarbled with black and brown.\r\n\r\n“At the approach of severe cold weather, and sometimes with no apparent\r\nreason, the lemmings leave their haunts in the high mountain chains of\r\nNorway and set out on a long journey toward the sea. The emigrating\r\nhorde, composed of myriads of individuals, trot in a straight line over\r\nall obstacles, never allowing themselves to be turned from their\r\ncourse. In traveling in a line, one after another, says Linnæus, the\r\ngreat Swedish naturalist, they trace straight parallel furrows, two or\r\nthree fingers deep and several ells apart. They devour everything\r\neatable that obstructs their passage, all roots and herbage. Nothing\r\nturns them from their course. Let a man appear in their path, and they\r\nslip between his legs. If they come to a haystack they gnaw a tunnel\r\nthrough it; reaching a rock, they skirt it in a semicircle and then\r\nresume their original direction. Should a lake be encountered on their\r\nroute, they swim across it in a straight line, however wide it may be.\r\nIf a boat is in their way in the middle of a body of water, they\r\nclamber over it and jump into the water again on the other side. A\r\nswiftly flowing river does not stop them: they plunge into the foaming\r\ncurrent even if they all perish.”\r\n\r\n“They must be very obstinate,” said Emile, “to prefer to drown rather\r\nthan turn their procession out of a straight line.”\r\n\r\n“Animals sometimes show these examples of obstinacy, which we cannot\r\nunderstand, but which might easily be explained if we knew the motives\r\nthat make them act thus. Perhaps by deviating from a straight line the\r\nlemmings might lose their way, a way provided with no finger-posts, but\r\nindicated simply by instinct. However, we will leave them to pursue\r\ntheir long pilgrimage, from which few will return, so numerous are the\r\ndangers and the enemies awaiting them on the way. Let them cross their\r\nrivers and lakes while we return to the rodents of France.\r\n\r\n“The hamster abounds in central Europe, notably in Alsace. It is also\r\ncalled the Strasbourg marmot or rye pig. It is almost as large as the\r\nblack rat, but is more stocky. Its tail is short and hairy, its fur red\r\non the back, black under the belly, with yellowish spots on the flanks,\r\na white spot on the throat, and another on each shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Hamsters live on roots, fruit, and especially cereals, of which they\r\nstore up a large supply. Each animal digs a burrow composed of several\r\nrooms, the largest of which is used as a granary. There they store rye\r\nand wheat, beans and peas, vetch and linseed. The hamster hoards like a\r\nmiser, laying up far more than it will ever need, simply for the\r\nsatisfaction of hoarding. In some of its store-rooms as much as two\r\nhundredweight of provisions may be found. What can a creature no bigger\r\nthan your fist do with all these supplies? Winter comes, and the\r\nhamster shuts itself up in its underground quarters, assured of food\r\nand lodging, and grows big and fat. If the cold is very severe it goes\r\nto sleep like the marmot.”\r\n\r\n“And what about the two hundredweight of grain collected, a kernel at a\r\ntime?” queried Emile.\r\n\r\n“The whole supply simply spoils and is so much waste; but little does\r\nthe hamster care; he begins all over again the next year. The animal’s\r\nspecial business is, first and foremost, to ravage fields, as is proved\r\nby the pile of grain it stores up, out of all proportion to its needs.\r\nIt hoards food to destroy it, far more than to be sure of something to\r\neat, being very different in this way from most hibernating animals. In\r\nthe midst of all its stores of food, if the winter is very cold, it is\r\novertaken by the same torpor that saves the hedgehog and the bat from\r\ndeath by starvation. This miser has not even the excuse of want. Happy\r\nare those regions that it does not rob! Let us pass on to other\r\nrodents.”\r\n\r\n“There are, then, still more of these greedy animals?” Jules inquired.\r\n\r\n“Yes; they are somewhat like insects: after they are all gone there are\r\nstill some left. The world seems to be a pasture delivered over to the\r\nmandibles of larvæ and the incisors of rodents.\r\n\r\n“Dormice, of many varieties, live in the woods and orchards and eat\r\nfruit. These rodents have the agility, elegance of form, and rich fur\r\nof squirrels. They make their home in hollow tree trunks, holes in\r\nwalls, and crannies in rocks. During the winter, when fruit is lacking,\r\nthey remain in a deep sleep.\r\n\r\n“The dormouse proper is found in Provence and Roussillon. It is a\r\npretty creature, reminding one of the squirrel. Its tail is long and\r\nthickly covered with hair; its fur ashy brown on the back and whitish\r\nunder the belly. At night it ravages the fruit-trees, and no one knows\r\nbetter how to pick out the pear, the peach, or the plum at just the\r\nright stage of ripeness. You have, let us suppose, looked over your\r\nfruit with satisfaction and decided to give it one more day of sunshine\r\nto bring it to perfection. The next morning you go out to gather the\r\nharvest and, lo and behold, it is gone; the dormouse has been there\r\nbefore you.\r\n\r\n“The garden dormouse is smaller, being about as large as the black rat.\r\nIts coat is a pleasing mixture of red, white, and black, the back being\r\nred, the belly, paws, cheeks, and shoulders white, and the parts about\r\nthe eyes and down the sides of the neck black. This animal is scattered\r\nall over France. It lurks about dwellings, in gardens, and among vines\r\nand shrubbery, living chiefly on fruit, which it ruins in great\r\nquantities, tasting first one choice specimen and then another, without\r\nfinishing any of them. Garden dormice spend the winter several in one\r\nhole, where they sleep all curled up amid the supplies of walnuts,\r\nalmonds, and hazelnuts that they have laid up.”\r\n\r\n“Then if they sleep,” said Emile, “they don’t need any food.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, my boy; they do need food, and badly, though not while\r\nsleeping, but when they wake up. This awakening takes place at the\r\nbeginning of spring, when the sun is first warming up the earth. At\r\nthat time of year there is no fruit to be had; and the garden dormice,\r\nafter their fast of several months, have a tremendous appetite, as you\r\ncan easily imagine. What would become of them now, poor little things,\r\nif it were not for their supply of nuts?”\r\n\r\n“Those little dormice are very prudent,” Emile remarked. “They know\r\nthat at the end of their long winter’s sleep they won’t find any fruit\r\nin the orchards, and so they lay up provisions beforehand. But why\r\ndon’t they put by apples and pears if they are so fond of them?”\r\n\r\n“Because apples and pears would spoil, whereas almonds and hazelnuts\r\nkeep very well.”\r\n\r\n“That’s so. I hadn’t thought of that, but the little dormouse had.”\r\n\r\n“No, it does not think of it, either. It does not know that pears spoil\r\nand nuts keep, because it has never tried to keep pears. It does not\r\nforesee that when it wakes up, the fruit-trees will not be bearing\r\nfruit, will hardly have their first leaves; it does not know how long\r\nit would have to wait to find a pear to nibble; it knows nothing of all\r\nthese things, which it is now about to become aware of, perhaps for the\r\nfirst time, through experience. Some one else thinks for the dormouse\r\nand gives it the prudence to store up nuts in a hole in the wall; some\r\none who understands, foresees, and knows everything. And that some one\r\nis God, the Father of the man who plants the pear-tree, and Father also\r\nof the little dormouse that is so fond of pears.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nHORNED OWLS\r\n\r\n\r\n“We have glanced in a cursory way at a number of our rodents that are\r\nharmful to crops. I pass over in silence the pretty squirrel, a lover\r\nof walnuts and beechnuts, and the industrious beaver, an animal which\r\nmay still be found, here and there, along the Rhone. The hare and the\r\nrabbit, too, I willingly give over to the hunter’s rifle. What\r\nprotection have we from the devouring hunger of the others—the rats,\r\nthe field-mice, and the meadow-mice? How are we to hold them in check?\r\nIn our homes we have the cat; outside we have the army of feathered\r\ncats—the nocturnal birds of prey. I will divide these latter into two\r\nclasses, to make it easier to distinguish the various species. One has\r\nthe head adorned with two tufts of feathers—plumicorns is the term\r\nsometimes used—while the other class lacks this ornament. Horned owls\r\ncome under the first classification; hornless owls, or those that may\r\nbe called simply owls, come under the second.\r\n\r\n“The largest of the horned owls is the eagle-owl. ‘It can easily be\r\nrecognized,’ says Buffon, ‘by its burly form, its enormous head, its\r\nlarge and cavernous ears, the two egrets surmounting its head to a\r\nheight of more than two inches and a half, its short hooked beak, black\r\nin color, its great clear eyes with their fixed gaze and large black\r\npupils, encircled by an orange-colored ruff of feathers, and its face\r\nsurrounded by hairs—or, rather, little rudimentary white feathers\r\nbordering a ring of other little feathers that are curled—also by its\r\nblack hooked claws of great strength, its very short neck, its reddish\r\nbrown plumage spotted with black and yellow on the back, its feet\r\ncovered with thick down and reddish feathers to the very roots of the\r\nnails, and, finally, its hair-raising cry of whee-hoo, hoo-hoo,\r\nhoo-hoo, poo-hoo, which it sends forth in the silence of the night when\r\nall the rest of the world is still. Then it is that it awakens its\r\nintended victims, fills them with vague alarm, pursues and catches\r\nthem, and carries them off to the caverns where it has its\r\nhiding-place. It lives among the rocks or in old deserted towers in the\r\nmountains, rarely descending into the plains and never willingly\r\nperching on trees, but rather on the roof of some sequestered church or\r\nancient castle. Its favorite prey consists of young hares, little\r\nrabbits, field-mice, and rats, of which it digests the fleshy substance\r\nand throws up the hair, bones, and skin in round balls. The eagle-owl\r\nmakes its nest in some rocky cave or in a hole in some lofty old wall.\r\nIts nest is nearly three feet in diameter, and is made of small dry\r\nbranches interwoven with flexible roots and padded with leaves inside.\r\nOnly one or two, or rarely as many as three, eggs are found in this\r\nnest. In color they somewhat resemble the bird’s plumage, and in size\r\nthey are larger than hens’ eggs.’”\r\n\r\n“Those two things like horns that the eagle-owl has on its head—are\r\nthey ears?” asked Emile.\r\n\r\n“No, my boy, they are egrets, upstanding feathers that give the bird a\r\nwarlike appearance. Its ears are not visible, being hidden by the\r\nplumage. They are very large and deep, which explains why the\r\neagle-owl’s hearing is so wonderfully acute.”\r\n\r\n“The eagle-owl,” Louis here observed, “eats field-mice and rats, for\r\nwhich it is to be thanked; but it also eats young hares and young\r\nrabbits. Isn’t that a pity?”\r\n\r\n“For the hunter, I admit; but for the farmer it is quite another thing.\r\nDon’t forget that the hare and the rabbit belong to the order of\r\nrodents; they have incisors which spare nothing in the fields. If they\r\nwere left to breed in peace they would prove a serious menace to our\r\ncrops. History tells of countries so ravaged by rabbits that it became\r\nnecessary to send an army to help the inhabitants get rid of them. We\r\nshall never reach that condition, I am sure; but it is no cause for\r\nregret that the eagle-owl, jointly with the hunter, keeps the animals\r\nwithin tolerable bounds. Moreover, the bird is very scarce everywhere.\r\nOne pair of these birds in a year is the most that you will find in the\r\nmountains about here. An extensive hunting-ground is required by such\r\nbig eaters if they are not to starve one another out.\r\n\r\n“I have a more serious complaint to bring against the eagle-owl: when\r\nit cannot find its favorite game—meadow-mice, field-mice, and rats—it\r\ncontents itself with bats, snakes, toads, lizards, and frogs, and thus\r\ndeprives us of some of our best protectors. Be assured, once for all,\r\nthat while we have some irreproachable helpers, there are also others\r\nthat from our point of view are guilty of a good many misdeeds. Bear in\r\nmind the mole, which throws up the earth and cuts the roots of plants\r\nin its war on insects. No animal gives a moment’s thought to man—except\r\nthe dog, who is our friend even more than he is our servant. No other\r\npays any heed to our interests; all work for themselves and their\r\nyoung. If their instinct prompts them to destroy only species harmful\r\nto us, so much the better: they are excellent helpers; but if they hunt\r\nboth harmful and helpful species, we must balance the total good\r\nagainst the total harm that they do. If the good tips the scale, let us\r\nrespect the animal: it is a helper. If it does more harm than good, let\r\nus declare war on the creature: it is a ravager. The eagle-owl catches\r\nin the fields such formidable hoarders of grain as field-mice and\r\nhamsters; in gardens, dormice and other lovers of fruit; in the\r\nneighborhood of our houses, ordinary mice and rats, and even the\r\nhorrible Norway rat. There you have the plea for the defendant. On the\r\nother hand, the hunter charges the bird with killing a certain number\r\nof young rabbits incautiously taking a taste or two of wild thyme by\r\nmoonlight, and with appropriating a few young hares that would\r\notherwise be eaten by human beings. For my part, I accuse it of feeding\r\nits young on the serviceable toad, the useful snake, and the\r\ncricket-eating lizard. There you have the prosecutor’s charge. But, the\r\nbalance being struck, the bird’s services are found to outweigh its\r\nmisdeeds, and I declare that the eagle-owl deserves well of the\r\nfarmer.”\r\n\r\n“It is a unanimous verdict,” declared Jules.\r\n\r\n“The common horned owl, or lesser eagle-owl,” Uncle Paul continued, “is\r\nmuch like the bird we have been discussing, only it is far smaller,\r\nbeing very little larger than a crow, while the other is the size of a\r\ngoose. It is the commonest of all the nocturnal birds of prey in these\r\nregions. In the night hours throughout the summer it keeps repeating,\r\nin melancholy accents, its long-drawn and doleful cry of cloo-cloo,\r\nwhich can be heard a long way off. Just as it takes flight it gives a\r\nsort of bitter sigh, made no doubt by the air expelled from its lungs\r\nby the effort of the wings at the moment of flying off. In the daytime,\r\nconfronted by human beings, this bird wears a dazed and foolish\r\nexpression. It snaps its beak, stamps its feet, and moves its big head\r\nabruptly up and down and from side to side. If attacked by too strong\r\nan enemy, it lies down on its back and threatens its foe with claws and\r\nbeak. It inhabits ruined buildings, caves in rocks, and the hollow\r\ntrunks of old trees. Seldom does it take the trouble to build a nest of\r\nits own, preferring to patch up one that has been deserted by a magpie\r\nor a buzzard. There it lays four or five round white eggs. I will\r\nremark in passing that the eggs of nocturnal birds of prey are not oval\r\nlike hens’ eggs, but more nearly round. The hunting habits of the\r\nhorned owl are like those of the eagle-owl: it has the same liking for\r\nrodents such as field-mice, rats, ordinary mice, and meadow-mice; it\r\npounces upon young rabbits in the same manner, after patiently watching\r\nfor them at the mouth of the burrow. Now let us pass on to another\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n“The short-horned owl, or large sparrow-owl, resembles the lesser\r\neagle-owl in plumage and size. The two egrets or plumicorns are very\r\nshort, and they seldom stand erect as in the two preceding species.\r\nBecause of the shortness of these ‘horns,’ the large sparrow-owl is\r\noften taken for a hornless owl. This species is seldom seen near\r\ndwelling-houses, preferring rocks, quarries, and ruined and solitary\r\ncastles. It builds no nest, but is content to lay in a hole in some\r\nwall or rock two or three white eggs, shiny and round, and about as\r\nlarge as pigeons’ eggs. Its usual cry is goo, uttered rather softly;\r\nbut if rain is coming the cry is changed to goyoo. Its diet is mostly\r\nconfined to field-mice and meadow-mice.\r\n\r\n“The red owl is of about the blackbird’s size. Its plumage is ashy gray\r\nmottled with red and marked with little flecks of black running\r\nlengthwise and fine gray lines running around the body. It is the\r\nsmallest and prettiest of our nocturnal birds of prey. When its fine\r\negrets stand up well on the forehead they give it a bold and martial\r\nair that goes well with its eagerness for the chase.”\r\n\r\n“In the picture,” Emile pointed out, “its horns are not standing up.”\r\n\r\n“No, the bird is represented in one of its peaceful moments; there is\r\nnothing to arouse it, nothing to attract its attention. It has\r\nwithdrawn into itself and is thinking of the fine feast it had when it\r\nlast went hunting. It is digesting that feast. But let a mouse come and\r\nscratch anywhere near, and the red owl immediately ruffles its\r\nforehead—the first sign of attention. It straightens up and spreads out\r\nits egrets—a sign of the closest possible attention. It has heard, it\r\nhas understood. Off darts the bird and the mouse is caught.\r\n\r\n“The smaller rodents are its delight. It seasons them with beetles and\r\nJune-bugs—especially the latter which are an aid to digestion. When\r\nlarger game is lacking it contents itself with a frugal meal of\r\ninsects, hoping to make up for it soon with a good dinner of\r\nmeadow-mice.\r\n\r\n“Red owls are great travelers. They assemble in companies, sometimes to\r\nmigrate for the winter and seek a warmer clime, sometimes to search out\r\na district where there is plenty of game, when their present haunts no\r\nlonger offer enough to suffice them. If field-mice are on the increase\r\nin some particular region and are ravaging the fields of grain and hay,\r\nthe red owls hear of it, I don’t know how. They spread the glad\r\ntidings, all club together, and start for the lands where feasting\r\nawaits them. With such zeal do they apply themselves to the work of\r\nextermination that in a few weeks the fields are cleared of the\r\ninfesting hordes.\r\n\r\n“Red owls nest in hollow trees and clefts in rocks. Their eggs, from\r\ntwo to four in a nest, are of a shiny white.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nOTHER OWLS\r\n\r\n\r\n“Owls not belonging to the horned class lack, of course, the egrets or\r\nplumicorns characteristic of the latter. The largest of the hornless\r\nowls is the howlet or tawny owl, which is about as large as one of our\r\ndomestic hens. The predominating color of its plumage is grayish in the\r\nmale and reddish in the female, a difference that sometimes causes them\r\nto be mistaken for separate species. On this background color is a\r\nsprinkling of light brown spots, running lengthwise of the body and\r\nless numerous on the breast and stomach than elsewhere. The wings are\r\nmarked with several large, white, round spots. The head is very large\r\nand nearly round, the face sunken in the surrounding feathers and\r\npartly concealed by them. The eyes, likewise sunken, are brown and\r\nsurrounded with small gray feathers.\r\n\r\n“The name howlet is connected in its derivation with the word howl, and\r\nthe bird called by that name is indeed remarkable for its cry, not\r\nunlike a wolf’s howl. When at the close of a somber winter day the wind\r\nwhips the snow and moans in the trees, one may often hear a frightful\r\ncry, prolonged and mournful, rising from the dark depths of the\r\nforest—hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo. Then in the lonely cottage the\r\nfrightened mother makes the sign of the cross, while her little ones\r\npress close to her, crying, and saying, ‘The wolves are coming.’ Don’t\r\nbe uneasy, good people; it is not a wolf, it is an owl hoo-hooing,\r\nsounding its war-cry from the top of some hollow oak and getting ready\r\nfor its nightly rounds.\r\n\r\n“In summer-time the howlet lives in the woods. It hunts by preference\r\nfield-mice and meadow-mice, which it swallows whole, afterward throwing\r\nup the skin and bones rolled into a ball. The little birds that worry\r\nit so unmercifully in the daytime, whenever they get a chance to come\r\nupon it unawares in the sunlight, are not safe from its beak in the\r\nhours of darkness if the night-bird can pounce upon them after first\r\nfrightening them with its terrible hoo-hoo. Keep as still as mice in\r\nyour hiding-places, you finches and redbreasts and tomtits, and don’t\r\nbetray yourselves by giving voice to your alarm. Let the owl hoo-hoo as\r\nmuch as it pleases. If you make a sound you are lost.\r\n\r\n“If the fields prove disappointing as a hunting-ground, the owl makes\r\nbold to approach dwelling-houses and finds its way into barns, there to\r\nplay the part of cat and thus make good the title of ‘hooting cat’\r\nwhich has been given it. For patience and skill in catching rats and\r\nmice it rivals Raminagrobis [4] himself. It is a guest to be treated\r\nwith respect when hunger compels it to visit our granaries. After\r\ncompleting its nightly rounds it returns to the woods early in the\r\nmorning, hides in the densest thickets or in the trees having the most\r\nabundant foliage, and there passes the day silent and motionless. In\r\nwinter its home is always in the hollow of some old tree trunk. It lays\r\nits eggs in the abandoned nests of magpies, crows, buzzards, and\r\nkestrels; and these eggs, of a dingy gray color, are about as large as\r\na pullet’s, but nearly round.\r\n\r\n“The belfry-owl, also known as the barn-owl, is an ungainly bird rather\r\nsmaller than the howlet. Its plumage, however, is not wanting in\r\nelegance, being red on the back, sprinkled with gray and brown and\r\nprettily dotted with white points alternating with dark ones, and white\r\nunderneath, with or without brown spots. The eyes are deep-set and each\r\nis encircled by a ring of fine white feathers almost like hair. A\r\nlittle collar bordered with red frames the face. The beak is whitish,\r\nand the claws are covered only with a soft white down, very short,\r\nunder which the pink flesh can be seen. This bird has none of the proud\r\nbearing of the eagle-owl and the red owl; it carries itself awkwardly\r\nwith an embarrassed, almost shamefaced look. Humpbacked and with wings\r\nhanging down, face sad and scowling, and legs long and ungainly—such is\r\nthe barn-owl’s appearance in repose. As if to complete its ungraceful\r\nattitude, the bird, whenever anything disturbs it, teeters from side to\r\nside in a ludicrous fashion, with haggard eyes and wings slightly\r\nraised.”\r\n\r\n“And what is the teetering for?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“No doubt to frighten its enemy. In time of danger the barn-owl utters\r\na harsh, grating cry—craa! craa! craa!—which often frightens away the\r\nenemy. The owl’s habitual cry in the silence of the night is a\r\nmournful, heavy breathing not unlike the snoring of a man sleeping with\r\nhis mouth open. To these cries add the darkness of the night, the near\r\nneighborhood of churches and cemeteries, and you will understand how\r\nthe innocent barn-owl has managed to frighten children, women, and even\r\nmen; you will be able to see why it has the reputation of being a\r\nfuneral bird, the bird of death, summoning to the cemetery one of the\r\npersons living in the house it visits. The French name, effraie\r\n(fright), has reference to these superstitious terrors; it designates\r\nthe bird that frightens with its nightly chant those who are foolish\r\nenough to believe in ghosts and sorcerers.”\r\n\r\n“It may practise its chant on our roof as much as it likes,” Jules\r\ndeclared boldly; “it won’t scare me a bit.”\r\n\r\n“Nor would it scare any one else if everybody would listen to reason\r\ninstead of putting faith in ridiculous stories. Fear, like cruelty, is\r\nthe daughter of ignorance. Train your reason, accustom yourselves to\r\nsee things as they really are, and foolish fears will be banished.\r\n\r\n“The barn-owl also goes by the name of belfry-owl, because it likes to\r\nmake its home in old church towers. Sometimes it will enter a church by\r\nnight to hunt mice. Those who first came upon the ill-famed bird near\r\nthe altar did not fail to accuse it of drinking oil from the lamp or,\r\nrather, of eating it when it is congealed by the cold. The charge\r\nitself proves its own falsity, as oil cannot congeal in a lamp that is\r\nalways kept burning. But the slanderers do not trouble themselves about\r\na little thing like that when they wish to blacken the bird’s\r\nreputation. They will continue for a long time, if not forever, to\r\nregard the owl as a profaner of holy lamps. In Provence they will\r\nalways call this bird the oil-drinker.\r\n\r\n“In reality, the barn-owl lives on rats and mice, which it catches in\r\nbarns and churches; on field-mice, meadow-mice, and dormice, which it\r\nhunts in gardens and fields. Here, beyond a doubt, we have a service\r\nrendered that ought to make people forget its false reputation, make\r\nthem like and protect it as it deserves. Will the bird that gives us\r\nvery real help and is guiltless of a single offense ever be declared\r\ninnocent? I very much doubt it. Superstition is so deep-rooted that\r\nthere will never be lacking a One-eyed John to nail a live owl to his\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n“The barn-owl likes to live in inhabited regions. The roofs of\r\nchurches, summits of steeples, high towers—these are its favorite\r\nhaunts. All day it remains crouching in some dark hole, from which it\r\ndoes not come out until after sunset. Its manner of taking flight\r\ndeserves mention. First it lets itself fall from the summit of its\r\nsteeple like a dead weight, and it does not spread its wings until\r\nafter a rather long vertical drop. It then pursues a zigzag course,\r\nmaking no more noise than if the wind bore it along. It is fond of\r\nnesting in abandoned ruins, in the hollow trunks of worm-eaten trees,\r\noccasionally in barns, high up on some beam. But it builds no nest to\r\nhold its eggs, which are laid on the spot that may have been selected,\r\nwith no leaves, roots, or hair to serve as bedding. The laying takes\r\nplace toward the end of March and is limited to five or six white eggs\r\nremarkable for their oval shape, an exceptional shape for nocturnal\r\nbirds of prey. The little ones, with their large eyes, beak stretched\r\nopen for food, and rumpled down, are the ugliest creatures imaginable.\r\nThe mother feeds them with insects and bits of mouse-flesh.\r\n\r\n“The smallest of our hornless owls is the sparrow-owl. Like the red\r\nowl, it is about the size of a blackbird. It is dark brown in color,\r\nwith large white spots of a round or oval shape. The throat is white,\r\nand the tail is crossed by four narrow whitish stripes. The sparrow-owl\r\nhas a quick and light bearing, and it sees by day much better than\r\nother night birds; therefore it sometimes chases small birds, but\r\nrarely with success. When it has the good luck to catch one it plucks\r\nit very clean before eating it, instead of following the gluttonous\r\nexample of the horned owls and the howlet, which swallow such prey\r\nwhole and throw the feathers up later. Its hunting expeditions are much\r\nmore fruitful when directed against field-mice and common mice, which\r\nit dismembers before eating. Other owls make but one mouthful of their\r\nprey; the sparrow-owl tears to pieces the animal it has caught, perhaps\r\nso that it may enjoy the flavor more. To express astonishment,\r\nsurprise, fear, the barn-owl waddles in a most ridiculous manner; but\r\nthe sparrow-owl adopts another method: it bows its legs, crouches down,\r\nand then abruptly rises, lengthening its neck and turning its head to\r\nright and left. You would say it was moved by springs from within. This\r\nperformance is repeated over and over again, each time accompanied by a\r\nclacking of the beak. In flight the bird’s habitual cry is poo, poo,\r\npoo; at rest it says ay-may, aid-may, repeated several times in quick\r\nsuccession in a tone almost human.\r\n\r\n“The sparrow-owl lives in deserted buildings, quarries, old and\r\ndilapidated towers, but never in hollow trees. It frequents the roofs\r\nof churches and of village houses. Its nest consists of a hole in a\r\nrock or a wall, where it lays four or five round white eggs somewhat\r\nspeckled with red.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE EAGLE\r\n\r\n\r\n“If it were my purpose to give you a systematic and scientific account\r\nof birds, instead of acquainting you with the various species useful to\r\nagriculture, I ought to have begun with birds that hunt by day and to\r\nhave postponed my talks on those that hunt by night; in other words,\r\nthe eagle, the falcon, and the hawk should have been described first.\r\nBut should you ask me why, I should be rather at a loss for a\r\nsatisfactory answer. For want of a better let us content ourselves with\r\nthis one: the first do their work by day, the second at night. But the\r\neagle and the others of that group live at our expense, while the\r\nhorned owl and its kind render us a great service by holding in check\r\nwhat would else be a disastrous multiplication of rodents.\r\nConsequently, in point of usefulness, the night-bird comes first.\r\n\r\n“But this is contrary to all usage, both scientific and popular, which\r\nputs the eagle first in the list of birds. Do we not say of the eagle\r\nthat it is the king of birds? Why has this title been given to the\r\nfierce bandit, the murderer of lambs? I should be puzzled to answer\r\nthis question did I not know man’s inclination to glorify brute\r\nstrength even though he himself may be its victim. You, my children,\r\nwill find that out only too soon, to your sorrow. Plunder on a grand\r\nscale appeals, alas, to something in our faulty human nature that makes\r\nus excuse it; nay, more, that makes us glorify it; whereas productive\r\ntoil, useful to all, leaves us cold or even disdainful. The falcon is a\r\nravisher of our hen-houses, a bloodthirsty marauder of our dove-cotes;\r\nand we hold it in high esteem, calling it a noble bird. Shall we, then,\r\nnever learn to judge animals and men by their true worth, their real\r\nusefulness? Let us hope that as so many fine minds have worked, are\r\nworking, and always will work to bring about this miracle, you, my\r\nchildren, will some day follow their example. Work for this end with\r\nall your power, and blessings be upon you if you succeed in giving some\r\nadditional strength, however little it may be, to this common effort\r\nput forth by all men of light and leading.\r\n\r\n“I shall discuss but briefly the birds of prey whose activities are\r\nconfined to the daylight hours. They are nearly all bandits, nothing\r\nelse, living at our cost by robbery and murder. From the fact that they\r\nhunt by day, never at night, they are called diurnal or day birds of\r\nprey. The brightest light does not dazzle them. It is even said of the\r\neagle and others of this class that they can look straight at the sun,\r\nand this is credited to them as an added title of nobility. But there\r\nis no great merit in this performance when once you know how they shade\r\ntheir eyes in accomplishing it. They have three eyelids to each eye:\r\nfirst, two like ours, an upper and a lower, which close in sleep, and\r\nthen a third, which is semi-transparent and is withdrawn completely\r\ninto the corner of the eye when the bird has no use for it, but when\r\nneeded comes out from under the other two, which remain open, and\r\nserves as a curtain. If the light is too bright or the bird wishes to\r\nlook toward the sun, it has merely to draw over the eye this third\r\neyelid, this eye-shade, through the semi-transparency of which the rays\r\nof light enter the pupil in a much subdued intensity. There you have\r\nthe whole secret of the eagle’s bold look in facing the sun.”\r\n\r\n“I could do as much if I shaded my eyes with a curtain,” Emile\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\n“All these birds are furnished with a very strong beak having hooked\r\nmandibles for dismembering their prey. Their claws are composed of four\r\nseparate talons to each foot, three of these talons pointing forward\r\nand one backward. The talons are long, recurved, and grooved on the\r\nunder side, the grooves having sharp edges that they may the better cut\r\ninto flesh. The eagle’s bearing is bold, its looks stern, and its\r\nflight marvelously powerful. Eagles like to circle about in the air, to\r\nsoar with scarcely a movement of the wings in the upper regions of the\r\natmosphere beyond our view. Nevertheless, even from this immense height\r\nthey can distinguish what is taking place on the earth’s surface below.\r\nThey explore every farm with their piercing eyes and inspect every\r\npoultry-yard. Let a suitable prey show itself, and instantly the bird\r\nswoops down with whistling wing, faster than lead would fall. The\r\nunwary fowl is snatched from under the farmer’s very eyes.\r\n\r\n“Fortunately, the eagle, the chief of these bandits, is a very rare\r\nbird. In form it is large, measuring a meter and more from the tip of\r\nthe beak to the tip of the tail, and it is covered with brown plumage.\r\nIts extended wings measure a span of nearly three meters. Its fierce\r\neye, overshadowed by a very prominent eyebrow, glows with a somber\r\nfire. The eagle’s nest is known as its aery, and is flat instead of\r\nbowl-shaped like other birds’ nests. It is a sort of solid floor made\r\nof interwoven twigs and covered with a bed of rushes and heather. It is\r\ncommonly placed on the face of some steep and forbidding precipice and\r\nbetween two rocks, the upper one of which overhangs and forms a kind of\r\nroof for the nest. The eggs, two in number—sometimes, though rarely,\r\nthree—are of a dingy white spotted with red. The young eaglets are so\r\ngreedy that at the time of their rearing the aery is strewn with bits\r\nof bleeding flesh. Some neighboring ledge of rock serves the parents as\r\nslaughter-house and cutting-up bench. It is there that the hares and\r\nrabbits, partridges and ducks, lambs and kids, seized in the plains and\r\ncarried in rapid flight to the lofty heights where the eagle makes its\r\nhome, are torn to pieces in order to be fed to the ever-hungry\r\neaglets.”\r\n\r\n“Is the eagle really strong enough,” asked Emile, “to carry off a lamb\r\nlike that? I had heard it, but couldn’t believe it.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing is less open to doubt,” his uncle assured him. “It would carry\r\nyou off if it found you alone in the mountains.”\r\n\r\n“I could defend myself with a stick.”\r\n\r\n“Possibly; but let me tell you an incident, one of many to be found in\r\nthe pages of an author whose word we may believe.\r\n\r\n“Two little girls, one five years old, the other three, were playing\r\ntogether when a medium-sized eagle suddenly swooped down upon the elder\r\nand despite her companion’s cries, and in the very face of some workmen\r\nwho came hurrying to the spot, snatched her up into the air. Two months\r\nlater a shepherd found, on a rock half a league distant, the body of\r\nthe child half devoured and dried up.\r\n\r\n“What do you think now of the eagle, the king of birds?”\r\n\r\n“I think it’s a brigand of the worst kind,” affirmed Jules.\r\n\r\n“Would you like to see an eagle in the act of hunting, witness its\r\nfierce joy when it buries its hooked talons in the quivering flesh of\r\nits prey? Then listen to this fine passage from the pen of that ardent\r\nlover of birds, Audubon. The scene is laid far from here, in America,\r\nand the eagle belongs to a different species from ours; but never mind,\r\nthe ways of these bandits are the same everywhere.\r\n\r\n“‘To give you some idea of the nature of this bird, permit me to place\r\nyou on the Mississippi, on which you may float gently along, while\r\napproaching winter brings millions of water-fowl on whistling wings,\r\nfrom the countries of the north, to seek a milder climate in which to\r\nsojourn for a season. The Eagle is seen perched in an erect attitude,\r\non the highest summit of the tallest tree by the margin of the broad\r\nstream. His glistening but stern eye looks over the vast expanse. He\r\nlistens attentively to every sound that comes to his quick ear from\r\nafar, glancing now and then on the earth beneath, lest even the light\r\ntread of the fawn may pass unheard. His mate is perched on the opposite\r\nside, and should all be tranquil and silent, warns him by a cry to\r\ncontinue patient. At this well known call, the male partly opens his\r\nbroad wings, inclines his body a little downwards, and answers to her\r\nvoice in tones not unlike the laugh of a maniac. The next moment, he\r\nresumes his erect attitude, and again all around is silent. Ducks of\r\nmany species, the Teal, the Wigeon, the Mallard and others, are seen\r\npassing with great rapidity, and following the course of the current;\r\nbut the Eagle heeds them not: they are at that time beneath his\r\nattention. The next moment, however, the wild trumpetlike sound of a\r\nyet distant but approaching Swan is heard. A shriek from the female\r\nEagle comes across the stream,—for she is as fully on the alert as her\r\nmate. The latter suddenly shakes the whole of his body, and with a few\r\ntouches of his bill, aided by the action of his cuticular muscles,\r\narranges his plumage in an instant. The snow-white bird is now in\r\nsight: her long neck is stretched forward, her eye is on the watch,\r\nvigilant as that of her enemy; her large wings seem with difficulty to\r\nsupport the weight of her body, although they flap incessantly. So\r\nirksome do her exertions seem, that her very legs are spread beneath\r\nher tail, to aid her in her flight. She approaches, however. The Eagle\r\nhas marked her for his prey. As the Swan is passing the dreaded pair,\r\nthe male bird, in full preparation for the chase, starts from his perch\r\nwith an awful scream, that to the Swan’s ear brings more terror than\r\nthe report of the large duck-gun.\r\n\r\n“‘Now is the moment to witness the display of the Eagle’s powers. He\r\nglides through the air like a falling star, and, like a flash of\r\nlightning, comes upon the timorous quarry, which now, in agony and\r\ndespair, seeks, by various manœuvres, to elude the grasp of his cruel\r\ntalons. It mounts, doubles, and willingly would plunge into the stream,\r\nwere it not prevented by the Eagle, which, long possessed of the\r\nknowledge that by such a stratagem the Swan might escape him, forces it\r\nto remain in the air by attempting to strike it with his talons from\r\nbeneath. The hope of escape is soon given up by the Swan. It has\r\nalready become much weakened, and its strength fails at the sight of\r\nthe courage and swiftness of its antagonist. Its last gasp is about to\r\nescape, when the ferocious Eagle strikes with his talons the under side\r\nof its wings, and with unresisted power forces the bird to fall in a\r\nslanting direction upon the nearest shore.\r\n\r\n“‘It is then, reader, that you may see the cruel spirit of this dreaded\r\nenemy of the feathered race, whilst, exulting over his prey, he for the\r\nfirst time breathes at ease. He presses down his powerful feet, and\r\ndrives his sharp claws deeper than ever into the heart of the dying\r\nSwan. He shrieks with delight as he feels the last convulsions of his\r\nprey, which has now sunk under his unceasing efforts to render death as\r\npainfully felt as it can possibly be. The female has watched every\r\nmovement of her mate, and if she did not assist him in capturing the\r\nSwan, it was not from want of will, but merely that she felt full\r\nassurance that the power and courage of her lord were quite sufficient\r\nfor the deed. She now sails to the spot where he eagerly awaits her,\r\nand when she has arrived, they together turn the breast of the luckless\r\nSwan upwards, and gorge themselves with gore.’” [5]\r\n\r\n“Poor swan!” was Emile’s pitying comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nHAWKS AND FALCONS\r\n\r\n\r\n“What are we to do with enemies like the eagle?” asked Louis when Uncle\r\nPaul had finished Audubon’s account of that bird’s fierce and\r\ndestructive rapacity.\r\n\r\n“Destroy them,” was the reply, “destroy them by every possible means,\r\nfor we can count on no assistance from other than human helpers. Eagles\r\nare the tyrants of the air, and no other bird dares attack them. The\r\ndestruction of their nests is the surest way to put an end to the\r\nravages they from time to time commit among our flocks. But it is an\r\nenterprise not without danger to make one’s way to the eagle’s aery and\r\nwring the necks of the young birds. The shepherds of the Pyrenees go\r\nabout this work in couples, one armed with a double-barreled rifle and\r\nthe other with a long pike. At daybreak, when the eagle is already away\r\nhunting, the two nest-destroyers climb to the top of the steep\r\ndeclivity where the aery is situated. The first man, the one armed with\r\nthe rifle, posts himself on the rocky summit to fire at the eagle if it\r\nreturns, while the second, his pike fastened to his belt, clambers down\r\nfrom rock to rock to the aery and removes the eaglets, which are still\r\ntoo young to offer serious resistance. But at their first cry of\r\ndistress the mother hastens to the rescue and hurls herself furiously\r\nat her enemy, who receives her with blows of his pike until his comrade\r\nbrings her down with a well-aimed shot. The male, until then soaring\r\namong the clouds, now descends like a thunderbolt and is on the\r\nhunter’s head before the man has time to use his pike. Fortunately a\r\nsecond bullet from the rifle-man stationed above breaks the bird’s\r\nwing.”\r\n\r\n“What if he had missed the bird?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“Then it would have been all over with his companion. His face torn by\r\nthe eagle’s beak and his eyes pecked out, he would have fallen to the\r\nfoot of the precipice, a mangled corpse. No, it is hardly a holiday\r\ndiversion to go bird-nesting among the haunts of the eagle.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure I shouldn’t care to undertake it,” was Jules’s comment.\r\n\r\n“Next to the eagle the goshawk is the largest of our diurnal birds of\r\nprey. It is a magnificent creature about the size of a well-grown\r\nrooster, brown above and white underneath, with numerous little dark\r\nstripes running around the body. The eye is adorned with a white\r\neyebrow, the beak is blue-black, and the feet are yellow.\r\n\r\n“The goshawk is the scourge of pigeon-cotes, for which reason it is\r\nalso called the pigeons’ falcon. It selects for itself a lofty perch on\r\nsome tall tree and there keeps a watchful eye on the flocks of pigeons\r\nforaging in the fields. Woe betide the luckless one that forgets for a\r\nmoment to be on its guard. The bird pounces upon it in oblique flight,\r\nalmost skimming the surface of the ground, and in less than no time the\r\npigeon is seized and carried off to some lonely rock, where the\r\nravisher plucks its feathers and tears it to pieces while still warm.\r\nIf the farmer is not on the lookout the goshawk attacks the poultry and\r\ndoes great harm. At the mere appearance of the bird’s shadow the\r\nrooster raises a cry of alarm and the little chickens hastily take\r\nrefuge under their mother’s wing, while she, her feathers ruffled and\r\nher eyes blazing, sometimes succeeds in frightening off the enemy by\r\nher show of boldness. For lack of pigeons and barnyard fowls the\r\ngoshawk hunts young hares, squirrels, and small birds, and in time of\r\nfamine it will even eat moles and mice. Wooded mountains are its\r\nfavorite abode, and it builds its nest in the tallest oaks and beeches.\r\nIts eggs, four or five in number, are slightly red or bluish and\r\nspotted with brown.\r\n\r\n“The common sparrow-hawk is about as large as a magpie. Its plumage\r\nsomewhat resembles the goshawk’s, being ashy blue on the back and white\r\nunderneath, with brown stripes running cross-wise. The throat and\r\nbreast are reddish, and the tail is barred with six or seven dark\r\nbands. The legs and claws are of a beautiful yellow, and are long and\r\nslender.\r\n\r\n“The sparrow-hawk is a hunter of pigeons, which it tries to catch off\r\nguard by flying around the pigeon-cote and by watching from the\r\nconcealment of some tree-top. The lark, the thrush, and the quail often\r\nfall into its clutches. Its flight is low and oblique like the\r\ngoshawk’s, the wings of both being too short and too rounded at the tip\r\nto permit of lofty flight or sudden charges. The young, just out of the\r\nnest and as yet inexperienced in the cunning of the chase, are for a\r\nwhile trained by the parent birds for the career they are to follow;\r\nand indeed it is no rare occurrence to see the whole family hunting in\r\ncompany. The sparrow-hawk nests in tall trees and lays four or five\r\nwhite eggs ornamented with brown spots, which are larger and more\r\nnumerous toward the big end of the egg. Both the goshawk and the\r\nsparrow-hawk, when they are attacked by an enemy stronger than\r\nthemselves, do as the horned owl does: they lie on their backs and\r\nbrandish their claws.\r\n\r\n“Of all our diurnal birds of prey, falcons are the most courageous and\r\nthe best equipped for flying. As a distinctive characteristic they have\r\na sharp tooth on each side of the tip of the beak, which itself is very\r\npowerful and curves downward in a notable manner from the very outset.\r\nTheir wings are pointed at the tip and when folded they extend beyond\r\nor at least as far as the end of the tail. All falcons soar in their\r\nflight when hunting. To this class belong the common falcon, the hobby,\r\nand the merlin.\r\n\r\n“The common falcon, which is as large as a hen, can be recognized by a\r\nsort of mustache or black spot it has on each cheek. Its back is of a\r\ndark ashen hue crossed by narrow stripes of a still deeper shade; the\r\nthroat and breast are pure white, with black markings running\r\nlengthwise; the stomach and thighs are light gray tinged with blue and\r\nstriped with black; and the tail shows alternate stripes of dingy white\r\nand of black. The beak is blue with a black tip, and the eyes and legs\r\nare a beautiful yellow. But it should be added that the plumage of the\r\ncommon falcon varies a good deal with age, and not until the bird is\r\nthree or four years old does it agree with the description I have just\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n“The summits of the wildest and loftiest crags are the falcon’s home,\r\nwhence it goes forth to hunt pigeons, quails, partridges, chickens, and\r\nducks. It rises and soars some time in the air, searching for its\r\nvictims, and then swoops down upon them like a missile hurled from the\r\nsky. With astonishing boldness it makes its way into the farmer’s\r\npigeon-cotes and chases the pigeons themselves under the very eyes of\r\npassers-by, in the middle of crowded streets. It will even snatch\r\npartridges from before the hunter’s rifle and from under the\r\nhunting-dog’s nose. Its cry is strong and piercing, and it flies\r\nunwearied at the rate of twenty leagues an hour for hundreds of\r\nleagues; but its walk is jerky and awkward because its hooked claws,\r\nfurnished with long and recurved nails, rest insecurely on the ground.\r\nThe falcon nests on the southern face of rocky precipices, the nest\r\nitself being clumsily built and holding three or four eggs of a reddish\r\nhue spotted with brown.\r\n\r\n“The hobby is smaller than the common falcon. It is brown above and\r\nwhitish beneath, with thighs and the lower part of the stomach red. Its\r\nboldness is equaled only by the falcon’s, for it gives chase to larks\r\nand quails even when the hunter is in the act of shooting them, and\r\ndashes into the midst of the fowler’s net to seize the decoy birds. It\r\nperches on tall trees and nests in their branches. Its eggs are whitish\r\nwith a few red spots.\r\n\r\n“The merlin is the smallest of the diurnal birds of prey, being\r\nscarcely larger than a thrush. It is brown on the back, and whitish\r\nwith brown spots underneath. Its nest, which is seldom found in our\r\npart of the country, is built in the hollow of a rock and contains five\r\nor six whitish eggs marbled at the larger end with brown and dingy\r\ngreen.\r\n\r\n“Despite its smallness it is a bold bandit. Little birds are\r\nterror-stricken at the mere sound of the merlin’s wings in their\r\nneighborhood. Even the partridge is not safe from its attacks. It\r\nbegins by separating one of the birds from the rest of the covey, and\r\nthen, circling about above it in a spiral, which grows smaller and\r\nsmaller, it descends until it can reach its victim with its claws and\r\nknocks it down with a blow on the breast.\r\n\r\n“Such are the principal diurnal birds of prey that we have to make war\r\nupon without mercy. Up and after these savage bloodsuckers, destroyers\r\nof game, ravagers of poultry-yards and pigeon-cotes! Take your gun,\r\nvigilant farmer, watch for the falcon and the goshawk, and let fire at\r\nthose brigands! Destroy their nests, break their eggs, and wring the\r\nnecks of their young, if you wish to save your chickens, ducks, and\r\npigeons.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nKESTRELS, KITES AND BUZZARDS\r\n\r\n\r\n“The kestrel belongs to the falcon family, as may be seen from the\r\nsmall, sharp tooth on each side of the tip of the beak. It is rather a\r\nhandsome bird, about the size of a pigeon, red in color, with black\r\nspots, and a white tip to the tail. The beak is blue and the legs are\r\nyellow. The kestrel is the most widely scattered bird of prey and the\r\none most often seen near human habitations. Its favorite haunts are old\r\ncastles, lofty towers, and belfries. One often sees it flying with\r\nuntiring wing around these buildings, uttering the while a piercing\r\ncry, plee, plee, plee! pree, pree, pree! which it sends forth to\r\nfrighten the sparrows snuggling in holes in the wall, so that it may\r\nseize them when they fly out. It carefully plucks the little captured\r\nbirds before eating them; but it has another kind of prey which gives\r\nit less trouble, and that is the mouse, which it enters open barns in\r\norder to catch, also the fat and savory field-mouse, which it spies\r\nfrom on high when holding itself motionless in the air in one position\r\nwith tail and wings gracefully extended. What will it do with its\r\ncatch? Will it skin the creature for the sake of cleanliness, as it\r\nplucks the sparrow? No, the common mouse and the field-mouse are dainty\r\nmorsels of which the kestrel would be loath to lose a single drop of\r\nblood. The rodent is swallowed just as it is, whole if small, piecemeal\r\nif large. After digestion the skin and bones are thrown up through the\r\nbeak in the form of little balls, just as in the case of the owl.\r\n\r\n“The kestrel nests in old towers, abandoned ruins, hollow rocks. Its\r\nnest, made of twigs and roots, holds four or five rust-colored eggs\r\nmarbled with brown.\r\n\r\n“We will pass now to the kite, which is different from all other birds\r\nof prey, with its broad and forked tail, its very long wings, its\r\nrather slender claws, and its very small beak, a beak not at all in\r\nkeeping with the bird’s size, which exceeds that of the falcon. This\r\nbeak makes the bird cowardly to excess, frightened by the slightest\r\ndanger, put to flight by a mere crow.\r\n\r\n“If pressed by hunger, however, the kite will venture into the\r\nneighborhood of pigeon-cotes and poultry-yards in order to seize young\r\npigeons and little chickens. Fortunately, the hen, if she has time to\r\ngather her brood under her wings, can scare the invader away by simply\r\nshowing her anger. For want of poultry, the kite, which is hated by\r\nthrifty country people, attacks reptiles, rats, field-mice, and\r\nmeadow-mice; and if it can get nothing else it will content itself with\r\ncarrion, such as dead sheep and spoiled fish.\r\n\r\n“The kite’s extended wings measure more than a meter and a half from\r\ntip to tip, and its flight presents a fine spectacle. When the bird\r\nsweeps in wide circles through the upper atmosphere, it is as if it\r\nwere swimming, gliding without the least apparent exertion. Then all at\r\nonce it stops in its flight and remains suspended in one position for a\r\nquarter of an hour at a stretch, held there by an invisible movement of\r\nthe wings.\r\n\r\n“The kite is of a deep red hue on the back and rust-colored on the\r\nbreast and stomach, with a whitish head and the large wing-feathers\r\nblack. Its cry resembles a cat’s mewing. It builds its nest in tall\r\ntrees or, still oftener, in the hollows of rocks. Its eggs, commonly\r\nthree in number, are white shading into dingy yellow and speckled with\r\na few irregular brown spots.\r\n\r\n“The birds known as harriers have a small semicircular collar of fine\r\nthick feathers projecting from each side of the face and reaching from\r\nbeak to ear, much like the ring around the hornless owl’s eyes. In the\r\ncontour of the breast, in the long legs and wings, and in the still\r\nlonger tail, they have something of the falcon’s appearance and\r\nbearing; while in their large head and in the little collar around the\r\nface they are not unlike the nocturnal birds of prey. Harriers frequent\r\nmarshes and the banks of stagnant bodies of water, where they lie\r\nconcealed among the rushes in order to seize any small rodents,\r\nreptiles, or insects that may come within their reach. The farmer has\r\nno complaint to bring against them, as they show proper respect for his\r\nlittle pigeons, chickens, and ducklings. Indeed, they are welcome\r\nvisitors on account of their strong liking for field-mice.\r\nUnfortunately, the hunter accuses them of killing game, especially\r\nwater-fowl, hares, and rabbits.\r\n\r\n“In this connection it is to be noted that the weasel, a small\r\ncarnivorous quadruped with a thirst for blood, is wont to make its way\r\ninto warrens in quest of young hares and rabbits, in order to suck\r\ntheir blood, after which the dead bodies are left behind some bush.\r\nThese murderous operations do not escape the harrier’s vigilance. In\r\nits leisurely flights it keeps a sharp eye on the surroundings of all\r\nwarrens in the woods, for the purpose of carrying off any dead bodies\r\nand feasting on the weasel’s leavings. That it may occasionally be at\r\nfault and mistake a live rabbit for a dead one, I should not dare deny;\r\nbut after all I forgive it willingly enough, and in consideration of\r\nits war on field-mice I should be inclined to bestow upon it the\r\nhonorable title of farmer’s helper.\r\n\r\n“If we may feel some uncertainty about harriers, there is no such doubt\r\nconcerning buzzards. In them we certainly have very valuable helpers,\r\nlarge eaters of field-mice and meadow-mice, and great destroyers of\r\nmoles, those tireless burrowers whose numbers must be kept within\r\nstrict limits. Buzzards have a short, wide beak, curving downward from\r\nthe base; wings very long, but not pointed, reaching almost to the tip\r\nof the tail; strong legs, and the space between the eyes and nostrils\r\nbristling with hairs.\r\n\r\n“Buzzards are fond of repose and phlegmatic by nature; or it might be\r\nmore accurate to say that they are endowed with a remarkable capacity\r\nfor patient and motionless waiting, a gift very necessary for the\r\nsuccessful hunting of the field-mouse, which must be watched for by the\r\nhour at the mouth of its burrow. For half a day at a time, if need be,\r\nthe buzzard lies in wait without making the least movement or giving\r\nthe slightest sign of impatience. One would take it to be asleep. Then,\r\nall of a sudden, the bird falls to hacking the soil with its beak and\r\ntearing the turf with its powerful claws. A disemboweled mole is\r\nbrought to light, or perhaps a field-mouse is the prize, and in either\r\nevent the victim is no sooner caught than swallowed.\r\n\r\n“Now do you know what reputation the buzzard has won by this habit of\r\nlong and motionless waiting so indispensable in the quest of game with\r\nthe acuteness of hearing characteristic of the mole and of rodents? The\r\nreputation of stupidity. We say of a person of limited intelligence\r\nthat he is as stupid as a buzzard. Here again is an instance of that\r\nwrong-headedness which makes us think little of so many of our helpers\r\nand glorify those that prey upon us. Stupidity is the name we give to\r\nthe buzzard’s peculiarities, and for no better reason than that the\r\nbird spares our poultry-yards and rids us of troublesome rodents;\r\nwhereas we speak of the eagle, which steals our lambs, and of the\r\nfalcon, plunderer of chicken-coops, as courageous, noble, and splendid.\r\n\r\n“The common buzzard is a large brown bird with a whitish throat,\r\nstomach-feathers marked with little lines alternately brown and white,\r\nand tail crossed by nine or ten dark stripes. Its beak is whitish at\r\nthe base and black at the tip, its eyes and legs yellow. This species\r\nnests in tall trees, the nest being made of interwoven twigs and lined\r\nwith wool and hair. It lays but three eggs at most, which are whitish\r\nand irregularly sprinkled with dingy yellow spots. It is the common\r\nbuzzard especially that has won the reputation of stupidity with its\r\nleisurely flying and its patience in watching for prey. It usually\r\nwatches on some mound of earth. Observers who have studied its habits\r\nsay that sixteen is about the number of mice it commonly eats in one\r\nday, which makes nearly six thousand a year.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the kind of bird we should like to have about our houses if we\r\ncould only tame it,” remarked Jules.\r\n\r\n“There is nothing to prevent our trying it,” his uncle rejoined. “The\r\nbuzzard’s disposition is good enough. Other observers, who have studied\r\nits hunting of field-mice, estimate that it eats nearly four thousand\r\nof these in one year. From this number you can form some idea of the\r\nmultitude of little rodents a whole flock of buzzards would be able to\r\ndestroy. But we must not give the bird too much praise. I know that it\r\ndoes not hesitate, when occasion offers, to seize and carry off a\r\nwounded young hare; and I also know that when the snow is on the ground\r\nand the buzzard is pressed by hunger, it will pounce upon any stray\r\nchicken that may have got out of the poultry-yard. But what are these\r\nfew acts of theft when compared with the thousands of rodents of all\r\nkinds that it clears away from our fields? Whatever the season of the\r\nyear, one cannot open a buzzard’s crop without finding common mice,\r\nfield-mice, and meadow-mice there by the dozen. If I owned a field that\r\nwas ravaged by these rodents, I should lose no time in planting a few\r\nstumps there to serve as perches and watch-towers for buzzards in their\r\npatient hunt for their favorite game.\r\n\r\n“There is another variety of buzzard, the hawk-buzzard, that does us\r\ngood service in its fondness for larvæ, caterpillars, and insects\r\ngenerally, particularly wasps.”\r\n\r\n“What, those wasps that hurt so when they sting?” asked Emile.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my boy; this buzzard feasts on the wasps whose sting is so\r\npainful to us; it swallows them without a thought of their sting, just\r\nas the hedgehog devours the viper and never worries about its venomous\r\nfangs. The bird attacks their nests with its beak and pulls out the\r\nnymphs from their cells, carrying them, fat and tender, to its little\r\nones.\r\n\r\n“This buzzard is a somewhat smaller bird than the common buzzard. Its\r\nback is brown, its throat light yellow with brown stripes, and its\r\nbreast and stomach white sprinkled with dark heart-shaped spots. The\r\ntail is crossed by three wide dark bands, the beak is black, and,\r\nfinally, the head of the old male is bluish-gray. The bird nests in\r\nwoods, in tall trees, and its eggs are rather small, being\r\nyellowish-white in color, but with so thick a sprinkling of large brown\r\nspots as sometimes almost to hide the color underneath.\r\n\r\n“The feather-legged buzzard has legs covered with long feathers, as in\r\ncertain species of pigeons bearing the same qualifying name. It\r\nfrequents river banks, uncultivated fields, and woods, and lives on\r\nfield-mice, moles, reptiles, and if need be on insects.\r\n\r\n“Here let us bring to a close our talk on birds of prey. I have told\r\nyou about the more important ones, both diurnal and nocturnal, about\r\ntheir habits, their food, and the services or the harm they do us. It\r\nis now for you to add to what these brief talks have taught you, by\r\nobserving the things that come under your eyes every day. Do not fail\r\nto examine with some care the buzzard as you see it perched on a mound\r\nand patiently watching for a field-mouse; also the kestrel as it flies\r\nscreaming around the belfry and pounces, sometimes on a mouse,\r\nsometimes on a sparrow; and the kite, too, as it soars on motionless\r\nwings in the blue sky. You will get from this sort of study, first, a\r\ngreat deal of pleasure, and, secondly, knowledge that will be highly\r\nuseful if you ever have a farm or a garden.”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” said Jules, “that you have left out the very\r\ncommonest of the birds of prey, the crows.”\r\n\r\n“Crows are not birds of prey,” replied Uncle Paul. “They have not the\r\nhooked beak, the clutching claws, or the sharp, curved nails of birds\r\nformed for a life of rapine. I will tell you about them to-morrow; or,\r\nrather, I will begin with that one of the crow family known as the\r\nraven.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE RAVEN\r\n\r\n\r\n“Their black plumage and similarity of shape make us mistake all sorts\r\nof birds for crows. Let us begin with one of these, the raven. This\r\nbird is of good size, being about as large as our domestic rooster, and\r\nit has a hoarse cry, uttered slowly,—craa, craa, craa. It is the raven\r\nthat has won such a reputation with children from that famous fable\r\nabout the raven and the fox.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know,” Emile hastened to interpose; “you mean the one that\r\nbegins, ‘Master Raven, perched on a tree, held a piece of cheese in his\r\nbeak.’ Where do you suppose he got that cheese?”\r\n\r\n“History remains silent on that important question, but my opinion\r\nwould be that he stole it from some window-sill where the farmer’s wife\r\nhad put out some newly made cheese to dry in a little wicker basket.”\r\n\r\n“The fox says good morning to Mr. Raven, and praises his plumage,”\r\ncontinued Emile; “and he goes on: ‘How trig and trim you are, how\r\nhandsome you look to me!’ And so on and so forth. How could the raven\r\nhelp having a swelled head after such flattery?”\r\n\r\n“That fox was certainly a cunning rogue. To make sure that the bird\r\nwill listen, instead of beginning with flattery that might have aroused\r\nhis intended victim’s suspicions (for the bird was not altogether\r\nlacking in common sense), he began by praising what is really not\r\nwithout merit. On a near view the raven is seen to be not by any means\r\nof a dead black; it shows glints of purple and blue on the back, and a\r\nflickering greenish tinge on the stomach, the total effect being that\r\nof some highly polished metal. At the first flattering words you may be\r\nsure the raven cast a complacent glance at its costume and, seeing it\r\nbrilliant with blue, purple, and green, found it quite as rich as the\r\nfox declared it to be. So now the bird was well prepared—ready for the\r\nfulsome flattery that was to follow. The fox would have it believe the\r\noffensive odor clinging to it from eating so much carrion to be the\r\naroma of musk, and its hoarse croaking to be melodious warbling. But\r\njust there was the difficulty, to make it croak and thus open its\r\nmouth, which held the cheese.”\r\n\r\n\r\n        “And if that voice of thine\r\n        Can match thy plumage fine,\r\n    Thou art the very phenix of all the woods around,”\r\n\r\n\r\nquoted Emile.\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s it,” said Uncle Paul. “Do you see how the sly rascal is\r\nmaking headway? He would have the raven believe itself a singer,\r\nmistake its raucous craa, craa for the note of the nightingale. Had he\r\nbegun with any such extravagant compliment, he would have defeated his\r\nown ends; but he very cleverly led up to this supreme flattery and, to\r\npique the raven’s foolish vanity still further, gave a doubtful tone to\r\nhis admiration. ‘I know,’ was what he seemed to the bird to say, ‘that\r\nyour voice is widely celebrated; but what I am not so sure of is\r\nwhether it matches your splendid plumage, whether you can really sing\r\nin a manner worthy of so magnificent a costume. I must hear you, and if\r\nyour vocal performance equals your outward appearance, then you will\r\nindeed prove yourself to be the paragon of birds, the very phenix of\r\nthese forests.’ ‘Ah, you doubt it?’ said the raven to itself; ‘well,\r\nthen, listen to this operatic trill: craa, craa, craa.’”\r\n\r\nEmile again took up the fable:\r\n\r\n\r\n        “And so to prove it could\r\n        Its boastfulness make good,\r\n    It opened wide its beak and thus let fall the cheese,\r\n    Which Master Fox did seize——”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Not so fast!” his uncle interrupted him. “Master Fox could not have\r\ngone on talking with the cheese in his mouth; he could not have pointed\r\nthe moral in that neat little lesson with which the fable ends. I can\r\nsee him putting his paw on the prize while he licks his chops and looks\r\ntauntingly at the shamefaced bird. ‘My good sir,’ he says, ‘let me call\r\nyour attention to the fact that you are a conceited nincompoop.’”\r\n\r\n“He doesn’t call the bird Mr. Raven any more, now that he’s got hold of\r\nthe cheese,” Emile observed.\r\n\r\n“No; to call him that was all very well in the beginning; it flattered\r\nthe bird. But now the fox makes fun of his dupe and calls him ‘my good\r\nsir’ in a tone of patronizing condolence. To express pity for those we\r\nhave cajoled and deceived—is not that the very perfection of roguery?\r\nThere we have, most assuredly, a fox that will make his way in the\r\nworld. Read in La Fontaine, the incomparable story-teller, the\r\nabominable tricks Master Reynard plays later on the goat, the wolf, and\r\nmany others; or, better, wait a while and we will read them together\r\nnext winter before the open fire. For the present we will leave the\r\nraven of the fable and try to learn something about the real raven’s\r\nmanner of living.\r\n\r\n“Ravens do not flock together as crows do, but live alone or in pairs\r\non rocky heights and in the tallest trees. The society or even the near\r\nneighborhood of its fellows is unbearable to a raven. With angry\r\npeckings it drives away from its chosen district any of its kind that\r\nmay try to establish themselves there, even though they may have been\r\nborn in the same nest. If the intruder is merely a bird of passage, it\r\nis conducted with menacing demonstrations to the frontiers of the\r\ndomain and is jealously watched until it disappears in the distance.\r\nCrows, social creatures, are treated in the same way. The raven asks to\r\nbe left alone, quite alone, on its bare rock, and woe to the\r\nill-advised intruder that disturbs its solitude! It builds its nest in\r\nthe topmost branches of a solitary tree or, still more to its liking,\r\nin some fissure that offers itself in the perpendicular face of a rocky\r\nprecipice. The nest is made of sticks and roots on the outside, and of\r\nmoss, hair, rags, and fine grasses within.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to know,” said Jules, “what ravens’ eggs are like.”\r\n\r\n“Birds’ eggs are usually remarkable for their beauty, both in shape and\r\nin color; and for this reason, if for no other, they merit our\r\nattention. But it is no idle or merely ornamental accomplishment to be\r\nable to distinguish one from another, to know whether any given egg\r\nbelongs to a useful species that should be respected or to a harmful\r\nspecies that should not be allowed to breed in the vicinity of our\r\nfields and gardens. With this end in view I have already told you the\r\ncharacteristic marks of the eggs of our principal birds of prey, some\r\nof which eggs should be destroyed without any consideration, while\r\nothers should be protected. As this is a matter that interests you, I\r\nwill continue in the same way and will describe the eggs of those birds\r\nthat we are still to talk about.\r\n\r\n“Know, then, that ravens’ eggs are much more beautifully colored than\r\nmight be expected from the somber plumage of the bird. They are bluish\r\ngreen, with brown spots. This background of bluish green, sometimes\r\nlighter and sometimes darker, occurs again, together with the brown\r\nspots, in the eggs of crows, magpies, jays, blackbirds, thrushes, and\r\nfieldfares, birds that resemble one another closely in their bodily\r\nstructure, despite their marked differences in size, plumage, and\r\nhabits. The eggs of certain blackbirds and fieldfares are of a\r\nmagnificent sky-blue color.\r\n\r\n“The raven is an omnivorous creature: fruit, larvæ, insects, sprouting\r\ngrain, flesh, whether in a fresh condition or otherwise, all suit it\r\nequally well; but its favorite fare is carrion, which it knows how to\r\nfind a long way off, guided by sight and smell. Wherever there is a\r\ndead animal, there the raven makes its appearance and contends for the\r\nloathsome quarry with dogs. The habit of gorging itself with this\r\ninfected food gives it a repulsive odor. For lack of dead prey—the sort\r\nmost acceptable to its tastes, its great appetite, and its\r\ncowardice—the raven hunts such live prey as young hares and young\r\nrabbits, and other small and destructive rodents. It pilfers from\r\nbirds’ nests both eggs and new-born birds, a succulent banquet for its\r\nyoung; and it even has the boldness to carry off little chickens from\r\npoultry-yards. Without offering the slightest plea in its favor, I\r\nleave the raven to the hatred it has always incurred by reason of its\r\nfunereal plumage, its forbidding aspect, its sinister croaking,\r\nrepulsive odor, filthy greed, and savage disposition.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE CROW\r\n\r\n\r\n“In France we have four kinds of crows: the black crow, the mantled\r\ndaw, the rook or harvest crow, and the jackdaw or little belfry crow.\r\n\r\n“The black crow has the same plumage and the same general appearance as\r\nthe raven, but is one-quarter smaller. During the summer these birds\r\nlive in pairs in the woods, which they leave only to get something to\r\neat. In the spring their food consists of birds’ eggs, especially the\r\neggs of partridges, which they know how to puncture skilfully so as to\r\ncarry them to their young on the point of the beak. Like the raven,\r\nthis bird is fond of decayed flesh and little birds still covered with\r\ndown. Crows attack small, weak, or wounded game, and venture into\r\npoultry-yards to carry off any unwary ducklings or little chickens that\r\nmay have strayed away from their mothers. Spoiled fish, worms, insects,\r\nfruit, seeds, according to season and locality, fill their crop. They\r\nespecially like nuts, which they know how to break by letting them fall\r\nfrom a sufficient height.\r\n\r\n“In winter black crows gather in large flocks, either in an unmixed\r\ncompany or together with rooks and mantled daws. They go wandering\r\nabout in the fields, mingling with the flocks and sometimes even\r\nalighting on a sheep’s back to hunt for vermin under the wool. They\r\nfollow the plowman to feed on the larvæ turned up by his plowshare; and\r\nthey explore the seeded ground and eat recently sown grain made tender\r\nand sweet by germination. Toward evening they fly together to the tall\r\ntrees of some neighboring wood, where they chatter noisily as the sun\r\nsets, and smooth their feathers, and finally go to sleep. These trees\r\nare meeting-places where every evening the crows gather from different\r\nquarters, sometimes from several miles around. At daybreak they divide\r\ninto flocks of greater or less size and disperse in all directions to\r\nhunt for food in the tilled fields.\r\n\r\n“At the end of winter this company is broken up, the crows pair off,\r\nand each pair chooses in the neighboring forests a district a quarter\r\nof a league in extent, from which every other couple is excluded, this\r\narrangement ensuring sufficient subsistence for each establishment in\r\nthe bird colony. The nest is built in some tree of medium size, and is\r\nmade of small twigs and roots interwoven and rudely cemented with loam\r\nor horse dung, a mattress of fine rootlets being laid inside. If some\r\nbird of prey happens to come too near this nest, its owners assail the\r\nintruder with fury and crack its skull with a blow of the beak.”\r\n\r\n“Good for you, brave crows!” cried Emile. “Your enemies will think\r\ntwice before they come and bother you.”\r\n\r\n“I admire the courage of crows in protecting their young,” Uncle Paul\r\nadmitted; “but I cannot forgive them their plundering of poultry-yards,\r\ntheir thefts of young birds and eggs, and their upturning of seeded\r\nground. We must then include the black crow among bandits that are to\r\nbe destroyed.\r\n\r\n“In the same class, too, we must place the mantled daw, so called from\r\nthe sort of grayish-white cloak that reaches from the shoulders to the\r\ntail both in front and on the back. The rest of the plumage is black,\r\nwith glints of blue, like the raven’s. This bird comes to us toward the\r\nend of autumn, joins the company of black crows and rooks, and may be\r\nseen searching our fields for larvæ and sprouting grain. On the\r\nseashore, where its numbers are much greater than in the interior, it\r\nlives on fish and mollusks cast up by the waves or left by fishermen.\r\nOnly under dire necessity will it touch carrion, the favorite food of\r\nthe black crow and the raven. In March the mantled daw leaves us, to go\r\nand breed in the North.\r\n\r\n“The rook, which is a little smaller than the black crow, has the\r\nlatter’s plumage, but with more of a violet and coppery luster. Its\r\nbeak, too, is more nearly straight and has a sharper tip. It is readily\r\ndistinguished from the crow and the raven by the characteristic mark of\r\nits occupation, the skin of its forehead and around the beak being bare\r\nof feathers and looking white and powdery, like a scar. Is the bird\r\nborn like that? Not at all. Just as a workman handling rough and heavy\r\nobjects makes his hands callous, so the rook acquires by its work the\r\nrough and scaly skin so noticeable on its forehead. It is a tireless\r\ndigger and its beak is its pick, which it thrusts into the ground as\r\ndeeply as it can. From constant friction with the soil the forehead and\r\nthe base of the beak lose their feathers and become bald, or even have\r\nthe skin itself worn away so as to leave a rough scar. The rook’s\r\nobject in this toilsome operation is to capture white worms and all the\r\ndestructive larvæ that are such a scourge to our cultivated fields. I\r\nsaw some rooks one day hard at work in a waste tract of land, lifting\r\nup and turning over the stones scattered here and there. So eager were\r\nthey that they sometimes threw the smaller stones as high as a man’s\r\nhead. Now guess what they were looking for so busily. They were looking\r\nfor insects and all sorts of vermin. In this work of turning over\r\nstones and digging in the soil rooks cannot fail to injure their tool,\r\nthe beak, and they must rub the feathers off from its base.\r\n\r\n“I should have a high opinion of these birds if they contented\r\nthemselves with hunting insects; but unfortunately they have a decided\r\nfondness for sprouting seeds, a dainty dish that they exert all their\r\ningenuity to procure. It is said that they bury acorns and leave them\r\nin the ground until they begin to sprout and have lost their bitter\r\ntaste, when they dig them up and eat them.”\r\n\r\n“What a bright idea!” Emile exclaimed. “The hard, bitter acorn is\r\nburied in the ground to get mellow, and when the rook thinks it has\r\nstayed there just long enough he has so good a memory he can go and\r\nfind it again and dig it up. By that time it is just right to eat, soft\r\nand sweet and a fine feast for Mr. Rook.”\r\n\r\n“So far there is nothing to find fault with,” said Uncle Paul. “A\r\nbushel more or less of acorns is a small matter, and I willingly hand\r\nthem over to the rooks to dispose of in their curious fashion. But\r\nother sprouting seeds suit them equally well, especially wheat, which\r\nthey can so easily procure in winter in the recently sown fields. When\r\nI see a flock of rooks sedately pacing the furrows and plunging their\r\nbeaks in here and there where the ground is softened by a thaw, I know\r\nwell enough those birds might pretend they were hunting for June-bug\r\nlarvæ, but he would be a simpleton indeed who accepted this explanation\r\nat that time of year, when the worms are all too deep in the ground for\r\nthe rook’s beak to reach them. It is wheat they are really after, and\r\nas rooks go in very large flocks, which may even darken the sky in\r\ntheir flight, you can easily understand that such reapers make short\r\nwork of their harvest. Nor is that all: in the autumn rooks consume\r\ngreat quantities of walnuts and chestnuts, and in the spring they dig\r\nup potato fields to obtain the newly planted tubers.”\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t they live on dead animals, as the black crow and the raven\r\ndo?” asked Louis.\r\n\r\n“No; a rook, however hungry, will not touch a dead animal. It must have\r\nseeds and fruit or larvæ and insects; and as it chooses one or the\r\nother of these kinds of food, the rook is our foe or our friend. So\r\nthere are two opinions about the bird. Some persons, remembering only\r\nits thefts, would wage a relentless war against it, feeling that each\r\nrook destroyed means a bushel of wheat gained. Others, mindful chiefly\r\nof its destruction of larvæ and insects, maintain that the rook\r\ndeserves kind treatment at the farmer’s hands because it rids his\r\nfields of vermin, following the plowman to pick up white worms in the\r\nfurrows and plunging its sharp beak into the ground for the grubs of\r\nthe June-bug. For these excellent reasons they declare the rook worthy\r\nof our protection.”\r\n\r\n“Then which of the two opinions are we to accept?” was Louis’s query.\r\n\r\n“To my thinking, neither of them, but something half-way between, as in\r\nthe case of the mole. If white worms abound, let us bear with the rook,\r\nas it makes war on these enemies of ours; but if we have no need of its\r\nhelp, let us chase the bird from our fields. In our warfare on\r\ndestructive insects we have two real helpers, the mole and the rook;\r\nbut unfortunately we have to weigh their ravages against their\r\nservices. Accordingly, let us treat them with forbearance if we have a\r\nworse ill to dread, but rid ourselves of their presence if our fields\r\nare in good condition.\r\n\r\n“All the year round the rook lives with its own kind. It goes in flocks\r\nto seek food, and in flocks it chooses its breeding-place. Sometimes a\r\nsingle oak has a dozen nests, with as many in each of the trees around,\r\nover a large tract of ground. There is great commotion in this aërial\r\ncity at the time of nest-building, for rooks are very clamorous and\r\nalso much given to stealing from their neighbors. When a young and\r\ninexperienced couple suspend building operations for a moment, to go\r\nand get further material for construction, the neighbors pillage the\r\nhalf-completed nest; this one carries off a little stick, that one a\r\nblade of grass and some moss, to use in their own work. On their return\r\nthe robbed ones are thrown into a terrible passion, accuse this one and\r\nthat one, take counsel with friends, and attack the robbers furiously\r\nif the theft has not been cleverly concealed. Experienced couples never\r\nleave the nest unguarded, but one stays and watches while the other\r\ngoes for building material.\r\n\r\n“The jackdaw or little belfry-crow is all black and about the size of a\r\npigeon. Like rooks, these birds fly in flocks and nest with their own\r\nkind. High towers, old castles, and the belfries of Gothic churches are\r\ntheir favorite abode. Their nests, which are made of a few sticks and a\r\nlittle straw, sometimes are placed each by itself in a hole in the\r\nwall, and sometimes are very near together in huddled groups. The\r\njackdaw when flying keeps uttering a harsh and piercing cry. It feeds\r\non insects, worms, larvæ, and fruit, but never on decayed flesh. It\r\nrenders us some service by clearing trees of caterpillars, but I\r\ncomplain of it for hunting the eggs of little birds. Although jackdaws\r\nare always to be found about our old buildings, they nevertheless move\r\nfrom place to place, usually in large flocks, sometimes of their own\r\nkind exclusively, at other times in company with rooks and mantled\r\ndaws.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nWOODPECKERS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn front of Uncle Paul’s house there is a grove of beeches several\r\ncenturies old, its branches interlacing at a great height and forming a\r\ncontinuous canopy supported by hundreds of tree trunks as smooth and\r\nwhite as stone columns. In the autumn that is where Emile and Jules go\r\nand hunt in the moss for mushrooms of all colors to show to their\r\nuncle, who tells the boys how to distinguish the edible from the\r\npoisonous kinds. There, too, they hunt for beetles: the stag-beetle,\r\nwhose large fat head bears enormous branching nippers; great black\r\ncapricorn-beetles that may be seen at sunset running along the dead\r\nbranches and clinging to them, as they go, with their jointed antennæ,\r\nwhich are longer than the insect’s body; and long-horn beetles,\r\nlikewise furnished with antennæ of unusual length, and also remarkable\r\nfor their wing sheaths richly colored with blue or yellow or red, with\r\nspots and stripes of black velvet.\r\n\r\nA multitude of birds of many kinds make this grove their abode. There\r\nthe quarrelsome jay fights with one of its own species for the\r\npossession of a beechnut; there the magpie chatters on a high branch\r\nand then flies down and alights in a neighboring field, jerking up its\r\ntail and looking around with an air of defiance; crows have their\r\nevening rendezvous there; and there the woodpecker hammers away at old\r\nbark to make the insects come out so that it may snap them up with its\r\nviscous tongue. Listen to the bird at its work: toc, toc, toc! If it is\r\ninterrupted in its task it flies away with a cry of teo, teo, teo,\r\nrepeated thirty or forty times in quick succession and resembling a\r\nnoisy burst of laughter.\r\n\r\n“What bird is it that seems to be making fun of us with such loud\r\nlaughter as it flies off?” Emile and Jules asked each other one day\r\nwhen they were watching from their window the woodpeckers and the jays\r\nat play in the branches of the old beech-trees.\r\n\r\nJacques, their uncle’s gardener, heard them as he was watering the\r\ncabbage bed. After finishing a series of little trenches to carry the\r\nwater to all parts of the bed, he came up to the window for a talk with\r\nthe boys.\r\n\r\n“That bird you see there,” said he, “with green plumage and a red head,\r\nis a woodpecker. It has several different cries. If it is going to rain\r\nit says plieu, plieu, in a long-drawn and plaintive tone. When at work,\r\nin order to keep up its spirits it every now and then gives a harsh\r\ncry, tiackackan, tiackackan, so that the whole forest echoes with it.\r\nIn the nesting season it gives a quick teo, teo, teo, just like what\r\nyou heard a moment ago.”\r\n\r\n“Then it has its nest now in the beech grove?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“It is at work on it, for all the morning I’ve heard it hammering away\r\nwith all its might. You see, it makes its nest in a hole that it\r\nhollows out by pecking the trunk of a tree with its beak. It’s a fine\r\nbeak it has, too, so hard and pointed that the bird is always afraid of\r\ngoing too deep into the wood. So after two or three good hard pecks it\r\nskips round to the other side of the trunk to see if it hasn’t bored\r\nclear through.”\r\n\r\n“Bah! you’re only in fun,” returned Jules.\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” protested Jacques; “it’s what I’ve heard said, and I’ve\r\noften seen the woodpecker hurry round to look at the other side of the\r\ntrunk.”\r\n\r\n“But the bird must have some other reason than just to see whether or\r\nnot the tree is bored through. I’m going to ask Uncle.”\r\n\r\n“Ask him, too, if he knows the ironweed that the woodpecker rubs its\r\nbeak on to make it harder than steel.”\r\n\r\n“Your ironweed sounds to me like a fairy tale.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m only telling you what I’ve heard. I don’t know anything\r\nabout it, myself; but they say it’s a very rare weed and that the\r\nwoodpecker goes to look for it in the mountains so that it may harden\r\nand whet its beak on it. And anything you touch to that weed becomes as\r\nhard as the best steel. What a find that would be for my scythe and my\r\nhedging-bill, my sickle and grafting-knife! I know many a man that\r\nwould give a bag of gold for the woodpecker’s secret.”\r\n\r\nThe young cabbage plants had by this time received enough water, and it\r\nwas now the lettuce’s turn. Jacques went back to his work and left the\r\nboys to puzzle over the question whether or not there was any truth in\r\nthis story of the woodpecker’s fear lest it might bore through the tree\r\ntrunk with each peck of its beak. They brought the matter up that\r\nevening in their talk with their uncle.\r\n\r\n“There is both truth and falsehood in what my good Jacques told you,”\r\nhe said. “The true is what he saw with his own eyes, the false what he\r\nrepeats from hearsay among the country folk. He told you correctly\r\nabout the woodpecker’s different cries, which he knows so well from\r\nhaving heard them over and over again; and he was right about the\r\nbird’s way of running around to the other side of the trunk that it has\r\njust struck several times with its beak. All the rest is false, or,\r\nrather, an amusing legend with a basis of fact which we will now\r\nexamine.\r\n\r\n“Woodpeckers live solely on insects and larvæ, especially those species\r\nof insects and larvæ that are found in wood. The large grubs of\r\ncapricorn-beetles, stag-beetles, long-horn beetles, and others are\r\ntheir favorite dish. To get at them they have to clear away the dead\r\nbark and bore into the worm-eaten wood beneath. The instrument used in\r\nthis rough work is the bird’s beak, which is straight and wedge-shaped,\r\nsquare at the base, fluted lengthwise, and shaped at the point like a\r\ncarpenter’s chisel. It is so hard and durable that, in order to account\r\nfor a tool of such perfection, some simple-minded wood-cutter made up\r\nthe story that has been repeated ever since, the childish story of the\r\nironweed. Need I tell you that there is nothing in the world that by\r\nits mere touch can give to objects the hardness of iron or steel?”\r\n\r\n“I had my doubts,” Jules declared, “when Jacques was telling us about\r\nit; I couldn’t believe in his wonderful weed.”\r\n\r\n“The woodpecker has no need to rub its beak against anything to give it\r\nthe hardness necessary for the work to be done; it is born with a good\r\nstrong beak, to begin with, and keeps it to the end, and that beak\r\nnever has to be retempered. It is the continuation of a very thick\r\nskull which can withstand rather violent shocks, and it is operated by\r\na short, strong neck which can keep up its hammering without fatigue\r\neven should the bird wish to bore into the very heart of a tree trunk.\r\nAfter it has drilled its hole the woodpecker darts into it an\r\nexceedingly long tongue, worm-shaped and viscous—that is, coated with a\r\nsort of mucilage made by the saliva—and armed with a hard barbed point\r\nwith which it transfixes the larvæ that have been uncovered.\r\n\r\n“To climb the trunk of the tree to be operated upon and, for hours at a\r\ntime if need be, to stay there where larvæ seem to be lurking, the\r\nwoodpecker has short, muscular legs which end in stout claws, each foot\r\nhaving four talons or toes, two pointing forward and two backward,\r\narmed with curved nails of great strength. The bird’s way of standing\r\non the vertical surface of a tree trunk is made possible not only by\r\nthe division of its talons as I have described them, with their strong\r\nnails clinging to rough bark, but also by a third support furnished by\r\nthe tail. The large tail feathers are stiff, slightly bent downward,\r\nworn at the tip, and supplied with rough barbs. When the woodpecker\r\nstarts in on what promises to be a long job, it plants itself firmly on\r\nthe tripod of its tail and two feet and holds itself steady even in\r\npositions that would seem to be highly uncomfortable. Without fatigue\r\nand without pause it can strip an entire tree trunk of its dried-up\r\nbark.\r\n\r\n“The objects of its persevering search are the insects hidden under\r\nthis bark. It can tell by the sound made when it strikes the tree with\r\nits beak whether or not the wood is decayed and full of insects, a\r\nhollow sound being of good omen to the bird. If the wood does not give\r\nout this hollow sound, the woodpecker knows that further drilling at\r\nthat point would be but so much labor wasted. In the first case it\r\nstrips off the bark, makes the wood beneath fly this way and that in a\r\nshower of little chips, clears off the worm-hole dust, and finally\r\nreaches the plump grub in its snug retreat. In the second case it\r\nstrikes two or three well-directed blows to start the dry bark and\r\nfrighten any insects that may be lurking underneath. Immediately this\r\ninsect population runs in alarm, some to the right, others to the left,\r\ntoward the opposite side of the tree trunk; but the woodpecker, knowing\r\nwell enough what is going on, reaches the other side in time to nab the\r\nfugitives.”\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Jules, “I understand what Jacques was saying. The\r\nwoodpecker doesn’t run around the tree to see whether or not it has\r\nbored through to the other side, but to gobble up the insects that are\r\ntrying to get away. I thought the woodpecker must be very silly to\r\nthink it could drill right through the trunk of a tree with one peck of\r\nits beak; but now that I know the real reason of what it does, I see\r\nthat it’s a wonderfully clever bird.”\r\n\r\n“I assure you once more that animals have more intelligence than they\r\nare given credit for. Let us beware of seeing an evil meaning in habits\r\nand aptitudes that we do not understand. Is it not said of the buzzard\r\nthat it is a stupid bird, just because it shows such patience in\r\nwatching and waiting, perfectly motionless, for the field-mouse it\r\nsuspects to be lurking under the ground? And here we have the\r\nwoodpecker accused of being so foolish as to think it can pierce a tree\r\ntrunk with one blow of its beak, merely because it runs around to\r\ncapture the insects fleeing to the other side! Bear this in mind: there\r\nis in animals no foolishness except what we ascribe to them from our\r\nown point of view. Whenever we are able to discover the real motive, we\r\nalways find their actions perfectly logical. And that is only what\r\nmight have been expected, for an animal has no choice in its acts, but\r\nis made to perform them according to its mode of life as determined\r\nfrom the beginning by Divine Wisdom. Man alone is free: by a sublime\r\nprivilege he is left to choose between good and evil, between sound\r\nreason and blind passion. He seeks and chooses, at his own risk and\r\nperil, the true or the false, the just or the unjust, the beautiful or\r\nthe ugly. But animals, having no spiritual battles to fight as we have,\r\nare now what they have always been and always will be; they do to-day\r\nwhat they did yesterday and will do to-morrow; for centuries and\r\ncenturies they go on doing the same thing without improvement or\r\ndeterioration, and with an unfailing sense given them by God.\r\n\r\n“Woodpeckers spend their lives running around tree trunks from top to\r\nbottom in order to start the old bark that shelters insects, and\r\nexploring all fissures with their long, pointed tongue, which is pushed\r\ndown into every hole where worms may possibly be hiding. These birds\r\nare placed in our forests as keepers. They inspect sickly trees in\r\nparticular, trees honeycombed by vermin, and they examine carefully the\r\ndiseased parts. Occasionally they may chance to attack a healthy part,\r\nespecially in making their nests, and they may thus injure the tree by\r\ndrilling into the live wood. But this damage is more than atoned for in\r\nthe long run, and so I do not hesitate to bestow upon our woodpeckers\r\nthe title of forest-preservers, a title earned by their assiduous\r\nwarfare on insects injurious to wood. Seldom do they leave their\r\ntimber-yard—the trunk and the main branches of the tree—and descend to\r\nthe ground, except when they chance to find an ant-hill, the inmates of\r\nwhich they devour with delight. They place their nests at a\r\nconsiderable height from the ground, deep down in a round hole bored\r\nwith the beak in the heart of some tree trunk. The bedding consists of\r\nmoss and wool, and the eggs, four to six in number, are in every\r\ninstance white, smooth, and as lustrous as ivory.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nMORE ABOUT WOODPECKERS\r\n\r\n\r\n“The commonest of our woodpeckers is the green woodpecker, which is\r\nabout as large as a turtle-dove. Its plumage has a richness rarely seen\r\nin that of any of our other birds. The top of the head and the nape of\r\nthe neck are of a magnificent crimson; two mustaches of the same hue\r\nadorn the bird’s face; the back is green, the breast and stomach\r\nyellowish white, the rump yellow, and the large wing-feathers black\r\nwith regular marks of white on the edge. The female has less brilliant\r\ncoloring than the male and its mustaches are black instead of red.\r\n\r\n“It is the green woodpecker that you heard in the grove this morning,\r\ngiving its cry of teo, teo, teo. I will not go over what Jacques has\r\nalready told you about its different cries. The green woodpecker is\r\npassionately fond of ants, and when it discovers an ant-hill it posts\r\nitself near by and stretches its long viscous tongue across the path\r\nthe ants follow. You know these little creatures’ way of marching in\r\nlong files, one or more, following the exact path taken by the leaders.\r\nThe woodpecker’s viscous tongue is extended across this line of march.\r\nThe ants from behind come up, hesitate a moment before the barricade,\r\nand then venture upon the tongue, in order to follow their friends\r\nmarching on ahead as if nothing had happened. Immediately we have one\r\nant caught, then four, then ten, all struggling in the sticky mucilage\r\ncovering the tongue. The woodpecker does not move, but remains quiet\r\nuntil its tongue is quite covered. Nor has it long to wait. Soon the\r\nliving trap, laden with game, is withdrawn into the beak. Ah, that was\r\na luscious mouthful! Without leaving the spot the ant-eater repeats\r\nthis performance again and again, laying its tongue on the ground and\r\nthen drawing it in black with ants, until its hunger is satisfied.”\r\n\r\n“Animals know more than one would think, as you said a while ago,”\r\nEmile remarked. “That trick of the woodpecker’s shows it plainly\r\nenough. Instead of picking the ants up one by one, which would be very\r\nslow work with such small game, the woodpecker takes them dozens at a\r\ntime. It lays its tongue across their path on the ground, draws it in\r\nagain when it is all plastered over with ants, and the thing is done.\r\nAnd the mouthful is well worth the trouble. Who would have thought of\r\nmaking a trap of one’s tongue, a trap that catches game with glue?”\r\n\r\n“But its passion for ants,” resumed Uncle Paul, “does not make the\r\nwoodpecker neglect its duty as keeper of forests. It goes climbing up\r\ntree trunks, tapping the sickly parts, and pecking away with blows that\r\nat a distance sound like hammer strokes. If a passer-by interrupts it\r\nat its work it does not immediately fly away, but runs around the trunk\r\nlike a squirrel, and from the other side sticks out its head a little\r\nto see who or what is coming. If the intruder advances, the woodpecker\r\ngoes on around the tree, always keeping on the opposite side until it\r\nbecomes frightened, when it flies off, making the woods ring with its\r\nsonorous tiackackan, tiackackan. It flies with swift darts and bounds,\r\nswooping down, then rising, describing a series of undulating arches in\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n“For its nest it bores out a deep hole in soft-wood trees such as firs\r\nand poplars. Male and female work with lusty blows of the beak, taking\r\nturns at the hardest part of the task, the piercing of the live wood of\r\nthe trunk, until the worm-eaten center is reached. Chips, wood-dust,\r\nand decayed fragments are dug out with the feet, and at last the hole\r\nis deep enough and slanting enough to exclude the light of day. The\r\nyoung ones leave the nest before they can fly, and they may be seen\r\nexercising near it, learning to climb, to run around the trunk of their\r\ntree, and to cling to it upside down. You will be amused to watch them\r\nif you ever have the good fortune to be present at the frolics of a\r\nyoung family of woodpeckers.\r\n\r\n“The great spotted woodpecker is about as large as a thrush. It has a\r\nwide red stripe across the nape of the neck, the upper part of the body\r\nis prettily spotted with pure white and deep black, and the under part\r\nis white as far as the abdomen, which is red, as is also the rump. The\r\nfemale has no red on the nape of the neck. The food of this bird is the\r\nsame as the green woodpecker’s. It strikes the tree with quicker,\r\nsmarter blows, and if disturbed in its work it remains motionless in\r\nthe shelter of a large branch with its green eyes fixed on the object\r\nof its distrust. Its cry is a kind of hoarse, grinding\r\ntrer-rer-rer-rer.\r\n\r\n“The variegated woodpecker much resembles the great spotted woodpecker\r\nin plumage, but is a little smaller. It is adorned with a red cap which\r\ncovers the whole of the upper part and the back of the head, while the\r\ngreat spotted woodpecker has only a stripe of this color on the nape of\r\nthe neck. Both these birds are found in the large wooded districts of\r\nFrance, and they live on the same diet,—insects, wood-boring larvæ, and\r\nants. Also, because of their velvet costume of black and white and\r\ntheir scarlet cap, they are both to be ranked among the prettiest birds\r\nwe have.\r\n\r\n“Let us add to them the little spotted woodpecker. It is smaller than a\r\nsparrow, and its dress is that of the great spotted woodpecker. This\r\nbird is found almost exclusively in the fir forests of the East and of\r\nthe Pyrenees.\r\n\r\n“The wryneck is closely akin to the woodpeckers in the structure of its\r\nfeet, whose four toes or talons are divided into two pairs, one\r\npointing forward and the other backward, and in its very long and\r\nviscous tongue which it pushes into ant-hills or stretches out on the\r\nground to receive the insects as they pass. It is a small bird, being\r\nno larger than a lark. Its plumage is watered with black, brown, gray,\r\nand russet, somewhat like the woodcock’s, but with tints better defined\r\nand more beautiful in their combined effect. The wryneck is a great\r\neater of caterpillars, and it is also passionately fond of ants, which\r\nit catches as does the woodpecker, with its sticky tongue laid on the\r\nground across their path. Its name comes from the habit it has of\r\ntwisting its neck and looking backward with a sort of slow and\r\nundulating movement like a snake’s.”\r\n\r\n“Why does it imitate a snake like that?” Emile inquired.\r\n\r\n“It is its way of expressing surprise and alarm; and perhaps it also\r\nhopes to frighten its foe with the motions. At any rate, it is\r\nsometimes successful. If a birdnest-hunter climbs up to its hole to\r\nsteal its little ones, the wryneck emits, from the depths of its\r\nretreat, a sharp hissing and begins to make snake-like movements with\r\nits neck. The young birds, still featherless, imitate their mother to\r\nthe best of their ability, and succeed so well that the hunter thinks\r\nhe has thrust his hand into a nest of writhing and twisting flat-headed\r\nvipers. Thoroughly frightened, the boy clambers down, not without\r\nleaving some shreds of his breeches on the way.”\r\n\r\n“Serves the rascal right, too,” declared Emile.\r\n\r\n“The wryneck reaches us in April and leaves toward the end of summer.\r\nIt haunts the outskirts of woods and visits gardens and orchards for\r\ncaterpillars. It nests in a hole in a tree trunk and gladly avails\r\nitself of the woodpecker’s abandoned quarters after furbishing them up\r\na little to suit itself. The eggs, which are white and polished like\r\nthe woodpecker’s, rest on a simple little bed of wood-dust that the\r\nbird dislodges from the walls of its hole with a few blows of its beak.\r\n\r\n“Despite the structure of its feet, the wryneck does not climb tree\r\ntrunks and rarely even perches on them, preferring to stay on the\r\nground and hunt caterpillars or stretch out its tongue in the ants’\r\npath, which has given it, in the South, the name of stretch-tongue.\r\n\r\n“The nuthatch, on the contrary, though differing from the woodpecker in\r\nthe formation of its claws, is a first-rate climber and spends its life\r\nrunning about on the trunks of trees, inspecting every crack and cranny\r\nfor insects and pecking at the old bark. Three of its talons point\r\nforward, the fourth alone being turned in the opposite direction; but\r\nfor firmness of support the last is worth two of the others, so thick\r\nand powerful is it, and the nail at the end so strong and hooked. The\r\nbeak resembles the woodpecker’s, being straight, fluted lengthwise, and\r\nsharply pointed. It is an excellent tool for digging into wood and\r\ngetting out the worms. The tongue cannot be projected like the\r\nwoodpecker’s to catch insects with its glue, nor does the tail serve as\r\na support.\r\n\r\n“The nuthatch examines old trees with painstaking care, going up and\r\ndown the trunk repeatedly, or around it in a spiral, and sometimes\r\nvisiting a branch above or below or on one side. Every crack is\r\nexplored with the point of the beak, to the accompaniment of the bird’s\r\nresonant cry, tuee, tuee, tuee, repeated again and again in a\r\npenetrating tone. Very few insects can escape so careful a search. If\r\ngrubs are lacking, the nuthatch makes a frugal meal of a hazelnut.\r\nFirst it fixes the nut firmly in the fork made by two branches, and\r\nthen it hammers away at it, encouraging itself the while by uttering\r\nits cry, until the hard shell is pierced and the kernel exposed.”\r\n\r\n“It must take the bird a long time to crack a hazelnut with its beak,”\r\nwas the opinion of Jules.\r\n\r\n“No, it is done very quickly, the beak is so hard and pointed. Very\r\nquickly, too, a caged nuthatch will break through the woodwork of its\r\nprison and make an opening large enough to escape through. Not even the\r\nwoodpecker has a better carpenter’s chisel.\r\n\r\n“The nuthatch is about as large as a sparrow. All the upper part of its\r\nplumage is of a bluish ash color, the throat and cheeks are white, and\r\nthe breast and stomach red. A black stripe, starting from the corner of\r\nthe beak, passes over the eye and down the side of the neck. This bird\r\nnests in a hole in a tree trunk and it knows how, if need be, to make\r\nthe opening of the nest smaller with a little moistened clay. Its eggs,\r\nfrom five to seven in number, are laid on moss or wood-dust and are of\r\na dingy white dotted with red. It gets its name of nuthatch (which\r\nmeans nuthacker) from its way of hacking the nuts it is so fond of.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nCLIMBERS—THE HOOPOE\r\n\r\n\r\n“I have been telling you about woodpeckers and the nuthatch,\r\ninsect-eaters with chisel-shaped beaks for cutting into trees and\r\ngetting out the worms hidden in the wood. Then I spoke of the wryneck,\r\nwhich does not use its beak for hacking old tree trunks, but can, like\r\nthe woodpecker, stick out its tongue on the ants’ path and catch the\r\ninsects with the glue of its saliva. Now we come to some more\r\ninsect-eaters, but their work is less laborious than that of the\r\nwoodpecker. They do not hack and hew tree trunks, but merely seek their\r\nprey in the cracks and crannies that serve as its refuge. For this kind\r\nof hunting they have a long and slender beak that curves slightly\r\ndownward.\r\n\r\n“As their name implies, climbers show great agility in climbing. Their\r\nbeak is very narrow, the better to penetrate the cracks in the bark of\r\ntrees, and it is bent like an arch and has a fine point. Their feet\r\nhave three talons pointing forward and one, much stronger, pointing\r\nbackward. We have in France two climbers, one of which is furnished\r\nwith a tail composed of a few long, stiff feathers that serve as a\r\nsupport to the bird in climbing, as the woodpecker’s tail serves that\r\nbird, while the other is not thus equipped.\r\n\r\n“The so-called common climber is a tiny bird with whitish plumage\r\nspotted with brown above and tinged with red on the rump and tail. Its\r\nlife is a most laborious one. It frequents woods, orchards, and the\r\ntrees of our public promenades, where you may see it always busily\r\nengaged in examining every square inch of the surface of tree trunks in\r\norder to thrust its slender beak into the cracks of the bark and catch\r\nany lurking gnats, bugs, caterpillars, or cocoons. It runs down the\r\ntrunk as fast as it runs up, which woodpeckers cannot do, their\r\nprogress always being upward, either in a straight line or spirally. It\r\nascends in little leaps and bounds, and helps itself along by propping\r\nits tail against the tree. Arrived at the top of the trunk, it descends\r\nquickly and begins the same operations on the next tree. At every step\r\nit cheers itself up with its sharp, flute-like cry. At nightfall it\r\nretires into some hole in a tree trunk. There, too, it makes its nest,\r\nwhich is formed of fine grasses and bits of moss held together by\r\nthreads from spiders’ webs. Its eggs, from five to seven in number, are\r\npure white with red spots.\r\n\r\n“The wall-climber, or scaler, makes its way up the perpendicular faces\r\nof rocks, ramparts, and old walls, prying out all the various insects\r\nand their eggs that may be lurking in the fissures. With its large\r\nclaws it clings to these vertical surfaces and does not use its tail as\r\na support. This bird, which is of about the size of a lark, has\r\nunusually beautiful plumage of a light ash color, with touches of\r\nbright red, black, and pure white on the wings. The throat is black,\r\nand so is the tail, the latter being edged with white at the tip. The\r\nrichness of its coloring and the habit it has of remaining stationary\r\nin its flight before the rock or other surface it is exploring, just as\r\nbutterflies hold themselves motionless on their wings while they suck\r\nthe honey of flowers with their trumpet, have given it the expressive\r\nname of butterfly of the rocks. It inhabits the Alps, the Pyrenees, and\r\nthe Jura Mountains. In winter it visits old buildings in our towns.\r\n\r\n“The hoopoe is especially remarkable for its double row of long red\r\nfeathers edged with black and white, which, at the bird’s pleasure, are\r\nmade to lie down toward the back or stand upright on the head and\r\nspread out as a handsome crest. The rest of the plumage is\r\nwine-colored, except the tail and wings, which are black. The wings are\r\nalso ornamented with white stripes running across them.\r\n\r\n“In size this bird is about as large as a turtle-dove. It lives alone\r\nand prefers to remain on the ground usually, rarely perching unless on\r\nthe lower branches of trees. Its favorite haunts are moist fields,\r\nwhich it walks over at a sedate pace, every now and then erecting its\r\nbeautiful crest either from satisfaction at having found a savory\r\nmouthful or because of being startled by something, for it is a very\r\ntimid bird. With its long beak it digs in the ground for grubs,\r\nbeetles, and crickets; or it gathers ants on its viscous tongue. When\r\nit has had enough it withdraws to some low branch and there digests its\r\nfood at leisure. At the mating season it says, poo, poo, whence without\r\ndoubt comes its familiar nickname of poo-poo.\r\n\r\n“Elegant though it is in appearance, the hoopoe is not at all\r\nparticular about the condition of its nest, which it makes in the\r\ninterior of a worm-eaten tree trunk. It lines the hole with a mortar\r\ncomposed of clay and cows’ dung, whereon it places a little bed of dry\r\nleaves and moss. This nest, so deep and so hard to keep clean, ought to\r\nbe cleared out daily, but the parent bird does nothing about it,\r\nleaving the filth to accumulate until it forms a rampart all around the\r\nnest. This barricade may serve as an excellent defense against the\r\nbirdnest-hunter, who would naturally hesitate to thrust his hand into\r\nthe foul mess; and so I will not censure the bird too severely for its\r\npoor housekeeping.\r\n\r\n“The hoopoe is with us only in summer. Toward the first of September it\r\ncrosses the Mediterranean to pass the winter under the warmer skies of\r\nAfrica.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE CUCKOO\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an old pear-tree with dense foliage, at the foot of the garden, a\r\nblack-headed warbler had built its nest. Day by day Jules had watched\r\nthe bird as it brought blades of dry grass, one by one, and wove them\r\ninto the shape of a cup, after which it furnished the interior with a\r\nhair mattress. Then came the eggs, to the number of five, light\r\nchestnut in color, marbled with darker streaks. Parting the branches\r\nvery gently in the mother’s absence, and standing on tiptoe, Jules had\r\npeeped into the nest, but of course without touching anything; he had\r\nmerely cast a rapid glance at the pretty cluster of five eggs lying\r\ntogether at the bottom. The laying was over, his uncle told him; now\r\nwould begin the incubation, and in a few days five little creatures,\r\nblind and featherless, would at the slightest rustling of the foliage\r\nstretch their yellow beaks wide open in mute appeal for food. Already\r\nJules was looking forward to the good time he would have in watching,\r\nfrom a distance, the bringing up of the brood, and was planning how,\r\nwhen the little birds should have grown a trifle larger, he would put\r\nsome small caterpillars and worms on the end of a stick and drop them\r\ninto the nest for the young ones to eat. Then before long the\r\nnew-fledged warblers would leave the nest and the garden would have\r\nfive more caterpillar-destroyers repaying with their services and\r\njoyful songs the kind-hearted attentions of their boy friend.\r\n\r\nThat was what Jules was eagerly looking forward to yesterday, but\r\nto-day he returns from his visit to the nest with a troubled look on\r\nhis face. A strange thing has happened: with the warbler’s five eggs\r\nthere is a sixth one, a little larger and of a different color. Whence\r\ncomes this strange egg? Who put it in the nest, and why?\r\n\r\nUncle Paul, on being consulted, went to the nest and came back with the\r\negg.\r\n\r\n“Your warbler’s nest, my dear child,” he said, “has had a fortunate\r\nescape; but for your visit this morning the young birds would have been\r\nlost almost as soon as they were hatched. This egg that I have brought\r\nback is a cuckoo’s egg.”\r\n\r\n“But I don’t see how it came to be in the warbler’s nest or what danger\r\nit threatened to the young birds that are coming.”\r\n\r\n“You will see when I tell you the cuckoo’s habits. It is a curious\r\nstory. The cuckoo is the bird that in early spring, when the meadows\r\nare sprinkled with violets and the trees are just putting forth their\r\nleaves, keeps repeating its cry of cuckoo, cuckoo, in a clear and\r\nplaintive tone.”\r\n\r\n“I have often heard it,” said Jules, “singing on the edges of woods,\r\nbut have never been able to get a good look at it.”\r\n\r\n“I have seen it flying away,” Emile put in, “and it seemed to me pretty\r\nlarge.”\r\n\r\n“The cuckoo is at least as large as a turtle-dove,” their uncle\r\ncontinued. “Its plumage is ashy gray on the back and white underneath,\r\nwith numerous brown crosswise stripes resembling those seen on many\r\nbirds of prey. The wings are long, as is also the tail, which is\r\nspotted and tipped with white. Despite its likeness to the goshawk and\r\nsparrow-hawk, the cuckoo is not to be classed as a bird of prey. Its\r\ntalons lack the necessary strength, and its beak, which is rather long,\r\nis flattened and only slightly curved. Those are neither the hooked\r\nclaws nor the savage beak of a bird living the life of a murderer. The\r\ncuckoo’s food consists entirely of insects and caterpillars. You\r\nremember the processionaries of the oak tree, those frightful black\r\ncaterpillars that spin large silken nests against the trunk of a tree\r\nand bristle with barbed hairs that cause such terrible itching if you\r\ntouch them?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Jules; “and you told us that the cuckoo eats those\r\ncaterpillars.”\r\n\r\n“It feasts on them, as it does on all hairy caterpillars; but the hairs\r\nare rolled up into a ball in the stomach and thrown up through the\r\nbeak. As a greedy devourer of insects and caterpillars the cuckoo\r\ndeserves protection; the only regret is that a multitude of little\r\nbirds most useful to us should be destroyed by it. Let us consider the\r\nfacts of the case.\r\n\r\n“The female cuckoo never builds a nest, nor does she know how to hatch\r\nout her own young; but let us plead the best excuse we can for her. Her\r\nbreast seems to be so formed as not to impart enough warmth to eggs to\r\nmake them hatch; and, more than that, she lays so often throughout the\r\nsummer as to leave her no time for making a home of her own. In short,\r\nthis bird never knows the joy of taking care of her young. It is not\r\nbecause she will not hatch her own eggs, but because she cannot. She\r\nhas to leave this work to other birds.”\r\n\r\n“Then the cuckoo’s egg I found in the garden nest was left there for\r\nthe warbler to take care of?” Jules inquired.\r\n\r\n“Precisely. Now see by what wonderful planning the strange egg comes to\r\nbe adopted by another mother. Bear in mind that the cuckoo lives\r\nexclusively on insects. The young cuckoo must have caterpillars. Where\r\nwill food of this sort be found if not in the nests of birds that feed\r\non insects, as for instance warblers, redbreasts, tomtits,\r\nnightingales, stonechats, wagtails, and others? It is to just these\r\nnests that the cuckoo goes. Sometimes it may chance to lay its eggs in\r\nthe nests of birds that live on seeds, such as linnets, bullfinches,\r\ngreenfinches, or yellow-hammers; but even then the choice is wise; for\r\nif the foster-parents are eaters of seeds they bring up their young on\r\nworms, which are easier to digest, and so the little cuckoo finds in\r\nthese nests food suited to its needs. But the cuckoo’s eggs are never\r\nlaid in the nests of quails, partridges, or other species whose young\r\nare granivorous from the beginning. In a brood whose habitual diet was\r\nnot theirs the changelings would surely die of hunger.”\r\n\r\n“But how,” asked Jules, “does the cuckoo know what nests to choose and\r\nwhat ones not to choose, when it lays its eggs?”\r\n\r\n“If it knew why it laid its eggs where it does, I should have to admit\r\nthat the cuckoo’s sagacity surpassed man’s; but it does not know at all\r\nthe reason for its choice. A wise Providence has arranged everything\r\nfor the bird. The egg—which, judged by the cuckoo’s size, should be as\r\nlarge as a pigeon’s or a turtle-dove’s—is hardly as big as a sparrow’s,\r\nso that it can easily find a place in the warbler’s or even the wren’s\r\ntiny nest without arousing the adoptive mother’s suspicions. Moreover,\r\nthis egg is variable in its color, as if the better to harmonize with\r\nthe coloring of those with which it will be incubated, whether in this\r\nor that or the other nest. Sometimes the cuckoo’s egg is ash-colored,\r\nat other times red, green, or pale blue. It may closely resemble the\r\nsparrow’s eggs, or it may be mottled with spots of smaller or larger\r\nsize, in lesser or greater numbers; or, again, it may be marbled with\r\nblack streaks. But, despite these variations, it is always easy to see\r\nthe difference between the cuckoo’s egg and the others in a nest. If\r\none of the eggs is found to differ from the others in shape and color,\r\nthat one certainly came from the cuckoo. By that sign alone I\r\nrecognized the egg we have here from the warbler’s nest.”\r\n\r\n“The other five,” Jules declared, “are as like one another as so many\r\ndrops of water; but the sixth, which you have there, is very\r\ndifferent.”\r\n\r\n“And that is why I am sure it belongs to the cuckoo,” replied his\r\nuncle.\r\n\r\n“The cuckoo seems to me,” said Louis, “very large to be able to get\r\ninto such a small nest as the warbler’s, the redbreast’s, or the\r\nnightingale’s, so as to lay its egg there.”\r\n\r\n“That is not what the bird does. The egg is laid on the ground,\r\nanywhere; then the mother takes it up in her beak, puts it in a sort of\r\npocket at the base of her gullet—a pocket provided for that purpose—and\r\nflies through the neighboring thickets on the lookout for a place for\r\nits final reception. When she finds a nest to suit her she stretches\r\nher neck over the edge, opens her beak, and lets the egg gently drop\r\namong the others. That done, the cuckoo flies away and never returns to\r\nlearn the result. Other eggs are placed in the same way, here and\r\nthere, one by one, in different nests.”\r\n\r\n“And do the owners of the nests make no objections?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“If they are at home they receive the cuckoo with angry pecks and chase\r\nher away; but she usually succeeds in choosing the right moment and\r\napproaches the nest by stealth when the owners are absent.”\r\n\r\n“But when they come back they must see at least that there is a strange\r\negg in the nest and throw it out.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all. Whether or not the mother bird perceives that there is an\r\negg too many, I could not say. But at any rate, as there must be\r\ncuckoos in the world, things are so arranged that their species shall\r\nnot become extinct, and all the eggs in the nest are watched over and\r\nhatched with impartial care, until the last young bird is out. At first\r\nall goes well enough: the young ones need but little food, and for one\r\nmore the parents can easily find enough worms. All are fed alike, with\r\nno more for the children of the house than for the stranger.\r\n\r\n“But pretty soon the young cuckoo is found to be growing faster than\r\nthe others; it will soon need for itself alone all the food that its\r\nfoster-parents can possibly secure with the utmost industry; it is\r\nalways opening its wide beak, always complaining of hunger. Moreover,\r\nit is cramped for room in the little house of hair and wool. Its\r\nfeatherless body, squatting there flat and red, its large head, its\r\nbottomless abyss of a beak, its big, bulging eyes, all give it the\r\nappearance of a toad sitting at the bottom of the nest. There is no\r\nlonger room in the house for all its inmates, nor yet enough food to\r\nlive on. Then a dreadful deed is done. The young cuckoo slips under one\r\nof the little birds, takes it on its back, which is hollowed as if for\r\nthe purpose, and holds it there by slightly raising its wings. Dragging\r\nitself backward to the raised rim of the nest, it rests a moment, and\r\nthen throws the burden over.”\r\n\r\n“The horrid creature throws out of the nest the little one of the bird\r\nthat feeds it?” exclaimed Emile incredulously.\r\n\r\n“Yes, in cold blood, so as to have more room for itself. With the tips\r\nof its wings it feels around for a moment to make sure the little bird\r\nis gone, and then returns to the bottom of the nest to go through the\r\nsame process with another. And so they all go, one after another, to\r\nthe very last; all are thrown out of the nest.”\r\n\r\n“I’d like to be there to catch him at it—the scoundrel!” was Emile’s\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\n“What becomes of the poor little things pushed out of their own home by\r\nthe ungrateful young cuckoo? If the nest is high above the ground all\r\nperish, crushed by their fall, and the ants immediately begin to suck\r\ntheir blood. If it is low, some live and take refuge in the moss, where\r\nthe mother comes to console them and bring them something to eat. The\r\ncuckoo remains in sole possession of the nest.”\r\n\r\n“And the horrid toad will starve to death there,” said Jules. “The\r\nfather and mother, now that their brood is destroyed, won’t bring it\r\nanything more to eat.”\r\n\r\n“That is where you are mistaken. They continue to feed it liberally, as\r\nif nothing had happened; they perform wonders to satisfy its big\r\nappetite; they do not allow themselves a minute’s rest in their efforts\r\nto fill that beak that is always open and is wide enough to swallow the\r\nnurses themselves.”\r\n\r\n“Then the warbler isn’t afraid of her greedy nursling that might gobble\r\nher up any moment?” queried Jules.\r\n\r\n“Although she is its mother only by chance, she is devoted to it. She\r\ncomes joyfully with a caterpillar at the end of her beak while the\r\ncuckoo gapes at the edge of the nest, as ugly as a little monster. With\r\nno tremor of fear the warbler delivers the mouthful by putting her head\r\ninto the yawning gulf. The gulf closes, swallows, and yawns again,\r\ndemanding something more, and all haste is made to satisfy its needs.”\r\n\r\n“Kind warbler!” murmured Jules. “What self-denial in order to bring up\r\nthe ugly rascal that has ravaged her nest!”\r\n\r\n“So it has to be,” Uncle Paul rejoined, “or we should long ago have\r\nbeen left with no cuckoos in the world to help us get rid of the\r\nprocessionary caterpillars of the oak-tree.”\r\n\r\n“All the same, I don’t like that bird.” And with this Jules took up the\r\ncuckoo’s egg he had found in the garden nest. “May I?” said he to his\r\nuncle, with a gesture.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I have no objection,” answered Uncle Paul, who preferred five\r\nwarblers in his garden to one vagabond cuckoo. And smack went the egg\r\nas the boy dashed it to the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nSHRIKES\r\n\r\n\r\n“All sorts of absurd stories have been made up about the cuckoo and its\r\ncurious habits, and thus fable has added to the actual facts, which are\r\nin themselves strange enough. Even to-day there are in circulation any\r\nnumber of fairy tales on the subject of this bird. I will tell you a\r\nfew of them in order to put you on your guard against these childish\r\nnotions.\r\n\r\n“First, they say cuckoos change their nature twice a year, being\r\ncuckoos in the spring and sparrow-hawks the rest of the year. According\r\nto this account, the bird comes to us from some distant country in\r\nApril in its first form on the back of a kite that is so accommodating\r\nas to serve it as a mount. This mode of travel is adopted by the cuckoo\r\nto spare its own wings, still too weak to carry it. Undoubtedly the\r\nbird’s plumage—which, as I have told you, resembles in its brown\r\ncrosswise stripes on the breast the plumage of certain birds of\r\nprey—has fostered this popular belief in the changing of the cuckoo\r\ninto a sparrow-hawk and of the sparrow-hawk into a cuckoo. People have\r\nallowed themselves to be deceived by this variegated dress. When the\r\nbird sings in April and May it is a cuckoo because it has the cuckoo’s\r\ncry; but when it falls silent in summer it becomes a sparrow-hawk\r\nbecause it has the plumage of one. So the cuckoo is changed into a\r\nsparrow-hawk, and when spring comes again the sparrow-hawk is changed\r\ninto a cuckoo once more. For thousands and thousands of years this\r\nnonsense has been believed by most people.\r\n\r\n“The cuckoo is a migratory bird: it remains with us from April to\r\nSeptember, but departs for Africa at the approach of winter. To explain\r\nits reappearance in the spring some one invented the story of its being\r\ncarried on the back of a kite; but I need not assure you that there is\r\nnot a word of truth in this fairy tale. The cuckoo is always a cuckoo,\r\nand it returns from warmer climes on its own wings, as does the\r\nswallow. Another legend is that the cuckoo turns into a toad.”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t that because the cuckoo, when it is young and before it has any\r\nfeathers, is very ugly and looks like a toad?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“Exactly. And, finally, the bird is accused of discharging on plants a\r\nfatal saliva that breeds insects. The truth of the matter is that a\r\ntiny insect, light green and shaped somewhat like a grasshopper, is in\r\nthe habit of pricking the stems of plants with its sucker to make the\r\nsap run; and this sap presents the appearance of a white foam that\r\nlooks like saliva. The insect takes its position in the midst of this\r\ncool and foamy froth to shelter itself from the heat of the sun and to\r\ndrink at its leisure. There you have the real facts in the case.\r\n‘Cuckoo-spit’ is the name popularly given to the insect. It does little\r\nharm to plants. In reality, then, the supposed harmful saliva of the\r\ncuckoo is merely an ingenious means employed by an inoffensive little\r\ncreature to keep itself cool. Many other ridiculous stories are told\r\nabout the cuckoo, but it would be only a waste of time to dwell on\r\nthem. Let us get on.\r\n\r\n“We have already had occasion several times to speak of our doubtful\r\nhelpers, those co-workers whose valuable services are offset by certain\r\ngrave offenses. You have just seen how that devourer of hairy\r\ncaterpillars, the cuckoo, is guilty of the blackest ingratitude toward\r\nthe warbler, its nurse, in brutally throwing out of their nest the\r\nlittle birds which would have become model caterpillar-destroyers. That\r\nis a rather high price to pay for the destruction of oak-tree\r\nprocessionary caterpillars. To finish the list of these birds whose\r\nconduct deserves, from an agricultural point of view, both praise and\r\nblame, I will tell you about the shrike, a great insect-destroyer, but\r\nalso a barbarous slaughterer of small birds.\r\n\r\n“Despite their diminutive size—the largest shrike being hardly as big\r\nas a thrush—these birds have the fierce boldness of the most powerful\r\nbirds of prey. They will even pursue any falcon that ventures near\r\ntheir nest. Their diet consists chiefly of large insects; but\r\nunfortunately they also pounce on little birds, greedily devouring\r\ntheir brains and afterward tearing their flesh to shreds and eating it\r\ntoo. For this life of rapine they have a strong hooked beak, toothed\r\ntoward the tip of the upper mandible, and powerful talons ending in\r\nsharp nails that resemble in miniature the claws of birds of prey. We\r\nhave in this country four species of shrikes.\r\n\r\n“The common shrike is of the size of a blackbird, and its plumage is\r\nashy gray above and white underneath. A wide black stripe, starting\r\nfrom the beak, continues around the eye and runs down over the cheek.\r\nThe wings and tail are black, ornamented with white. The bird likes to\r\nperch on lofty tree-tops, where it keeps repeating its cry of truee,\r\ntruee, in a piercing tone. In flying from tree to tree it looks as if\r\nit were going to alight on the ground; but presently it rises again,\r\ndescribing a graceful curve in the air. Its food consists chiefly of\r\nfield-mice and large beetles, but occasionally of small birds which it\r\ncatches on the wing. It likes to build its nest in tangled and thorny\r\nhedges, and lays from four to six eggs, reddish in color and encircled\r\ntoward the large end by a ring of brown spots. Similar rings are found\r\nplaced in the same way on the eggs of our various other shrikes and\r\nfurnish a distinctive and easily recognizable characteristic mark.\r\n\r\n“The black-headed shrike can be recognized, as its name indicates, by\r\nthe wide black stripe that encircles the forehead. This bird is of\r\nabout the lark’s size and has the plumage of the common shrike except\r\non the stomach, which is reddish. The eggs, white tinted with red, have\r\nthe ring at the large end formed of numerous little spots, red, brown,\r\nor violet in color.\r\n\r\n“The red shrike is slightly smaller. The top of its head and the back\r\nof its neck are bright red, the stomach and rump white. Otherwise the\r\nplumage is like that of the two species just described.\r\n\r\n“The red-backed shrike is the smallest and the best-known of our\r\nshrikes. It is ash color on the head and rump, chestnut red on the\r\nback, and light red underneath. A black ring encircles the eye, the\r\nthroat is white, and the large tail-feathers and wing-feathers are\r\nblack.\r\n\r\n“These last three shrikes that I have named can at will imitate the\r\nvarious cries of small birds, and they make use of this talent, it is\r\nsaid, to lure them to their destruction. The red-backed shrike is\r\nespecially expert in this. It first hides in some dense shrubbery and\r\nthen imitates the song of whatever species it hears chirping in the\r\nneighborhood. The imprudent ones come at its call, which they think\r\nproceeds from one of their own kind, and the red-backed shrike pounces\r\non them as soon as it has them well within reach. But this trick\r\nsucceeds only with inexperienced little birds, the older ones knowing\r\nit and taking care not to be deceived. The captured bird is skinned\r\nbefore being eaten, and that is the origin of the French name\r\n(écorcheur, flayer) given to this fourth species of shrike. The others,\r\nhowever, share this habit. As they lack the faculty of rolling the\r\nfeathers into a ball and throwing them up after digestion, as do the\r\nhornless owls, these birds take the precaution to prepare the game\r\nbeforehand by tearing off the skin in shreds. It is a quick way of\r\nplucking their victim. Notwithstanding its talent in imitating the\r\ncalls of other birds, the red-backed shrike is not so lucky as to make\r\ndupes every day. In case of failure the shrike contents itself with\r\ncommon mice, field-mice, grasshoppers, June-bugs, and fat beetles. Such\r\nis the shrike’s passion for beetles that when it has eaten all it can\r\nit continues to hunt them just for the fun of hunting; and, not knowing\r\nwhat to do with the captured insects, it impales them on the thorns of\r\nbushes. Perhaps that is its way of stocking its larder with food and\r\nletting it acquire a strong flavor like venison, a flavor much to its\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n“The other shrikes also have this mania for laying up reserves of\r\nbeetles stuck on thorns, reserves which the bird does not always come\r\nback for, and which often dry up on the spot without being touched. But\r\nthis waste of game is of little consequence, as the final result is\r\nalways to our advantage: we are delivered from a multitude of foes by\r\nthese eager hunters. When they do us such service shall we count it an\r\nunpardonable crime that they sometimes allow themselves the pleasure of\r\nfeasting on little birds? For my part I should be very reluctant to do\r\nso. I pity with all my heart the poor little bird that foolishly lets\r\nitself be caught by the shrike; but I also have a lively sympathy for\r\nthe beautiful tree which, if bereft of its defenders, would soon be\r\ngiven over to the worms and honeycombed with holes all packed with\r\nfilth.\r\n\r\n“The red-backed shrike frequents groves, orchards, and gardens. It\r\nnests in thick hedges, sometimes in the interlacing branches of\r\napple-trees. Its eggs are white tinged with red. The ring at the large\r\nend is composed of brown, gray, and greenish spots. In building its\r\nnest the bird uses a kind of everlasting that grows abundantly in the\r\nfields and has stems all covered with a white cotton-like fluff. The\r\ninside of the nest is furnished with a couch of little twigs and fine\r\nrootlets interwoven and comfortably overlaid with wool, down, and\r\nhorsehair. The other shrikes use in their nests the same materials,\r\nespecially the everlasting with its white fluff.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE TITMOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\n“At last we come to some caterpillar-destroyers that are never anything\r\nbut helpful. First of all there is the titmouse, also known as the\r\ntomtit.\r\n\r\n“It is a graceful little bird, lively and quick-tempered, always on the\r\ngo, flying continually from tree to tree, carefully inspecting the\r\nbranches, hanging from the tip ends of the slenderest of them in all\r\nsorts of positions, often head downward, swaying this way and that with\r\nits flexible support and never letting go its hold, while it examines\r\nall buds that it suspects of containing worms, and tears these buds to\r\npieces in order to get at the grubs and insect eggs they contain. It is\r\ncalculated that a titmouse consumes three hundred thousand insect eggs\r\na year, and certainly few birds have larger families to provide for!\r\nTwenty or more little ones all huddled together in the same nest are\r\nnot too great a strain on the parent’s energy and industry. The mother\r\nbird has to examine buds and the fissures in the bark of trees in order\r\nto find grubs, spiders, caterpillars, worms of every kind, and feed a\r\nscore of beaks always open and demanding food in the bottom of the\r\nnest. She comes with a caterpillar, the brood is all excitement, twenty\r\nmouths fly open, but only one receives the morsel, leaving nineteen\r\nstill expectant. Then away flies the titmouse again without an\r\ninstant’s pause, to seek more food. Thus back and forth she flies,\r\nwithout rest and without weariness; and by the time the twentieth mouth\r\nis fed the first one is again open, and has been open a good while,\r\nclamoring for more.\r\n\r\n“I will leave you to guess how many worms are eaten in a day by such a\r\nhousehold; and I will also let you reach your own conclusions regarding\r\nthe value of these birds as caterpillar-hunters among our fruit-trees.\r\nComplaint is made, I know, that they tear open the buds and destroy\r\nthem; but the harm they do is only apparent. When they pluck a bud it\r\nis to get out some tiny larva lodged between two scales, and not to\r\nharm the young leaves or flowers that are forming. It is better that\r\nthis wormy bud should perish; it would not have produced anything, and\r\nthe enemy lodged within it would have produced countless others to\r\nravage the tree the next year.”\r\n\r\n“Then the titmouse does not feed on vegetable matter?” asked Louis.\r\n\r\n“No, except perhaps occasionally on a few seeds, such as those of hemp.\r\nThe bird requires animal food; small insects of all kinds, their eggs\r\nand larvæ, suit it best. Its appetite for prey is so keen that it has\r\nthe courage to attack little, disabled birds or those caught in snares,\r\npecking at their skulls and greedily devouring their brains. It is true\r\nthat the titmouse is remarkably courageous despite its smallness of\r\nsize; it is extremely quick and quarrelsome, and a regular little ogre\r\nin time of famine. Its beak is conical, strong, short, and pointed; and\r\nits claws end in hooked nails designed for seizing their victims, like\r\nthe talons of birds of prey. With these the bird grasps its food and\r\nconveys it to its beak, like the parrot.\r\n\r\n“At the end of the brooding season the tomtits all assemble in\r\ncompanies of one or two families each and travel together by short\r\nstages. These companies appear to have a leader, probably the father or\r\nthe mother, and every now and then they are called together from one\r\ntree to another, after which they separate again, only to reunite once\r\nmore at the leader’s summons. Their flight is short and irregular: they\r\nscatter through the woods, gardens, fields, and orchards, inspecting\r\ntrees and bushes on the way and picking up larvæ and insects.\r\n\r\n“The titmouse family is made up of many species. We have eight in our\r\ncountry, but I shall speak only of the principal ones.\r\n\r\n“The coal-tit is the largest, being of about the redbreast’s size. It\r\nis bluish gray on the back and yellow underneath. The head is of a\r\nbeautiful glossy black, and a wide stripe of the same color runs down\r\nthe middle of the chest and stomach and around the eyes, which are also\r\nset off by a large white spot. The large wing-feathers are edged with\r\nashy blue.\r\n\r\n“This bird is very common in copses and gardens, and is the one we hear\r\nin autumn repeating, as it examines the bark of fruit-trees, its cry of\r\ntitipoo, titipoo, titipoo. At times this cry has a harsh sound like the\r\nrasping of a file, and this has given to the bird, in some\r\nneighborhoods, the name of locksmith. It nests in a hollow tree trunk,\r\nlining its quarters with some soft, silky material, chiefly fine\r\nfeathers. Its laying consists of about fifteen white eggs spotted with\r\nlight red, especially toward the large end. Its family demands not\r\nfewer than three hundred caterpillars a day, or their equivalent in\r\nvermin of some sort. What the gardener, the nurseryman, and the\r\nforester owe this valiant caterpillar-destroyer by the end of the year\r\ncannot be calculated. Yet I have seen these very persons angrily thrust\r\nan arm into the hollow trunk of an old apple-tree to pull out the\r\ncoal-tit’s nest and throw the whole thing to the winds,—eggs, feathers,\r\nand little birds only a day old. And they thought they were doing\r\nsomething worthy of praise, for according to them the coal-tit eats\r\nbuds. But I declare that the coal-tit does not eat buds; it eats the\r\nlittle larvæ lodged in the bud’s scales, and its instinct never allows\r\nit to molest healthy buds, which contain nothing of any value to the\r\nbird. Leave it in peace, then, to pluck the wormy buds, which it can\r\nvery easily tell from the sound ones.\r\n\r\n“The coal-tit sometimes eats hemp-seed or hazelnuts, picking out the\r\nedible part with a dexterity of beak and claw—I had almost said\r\nhand—possessed by no other bird. The sparrow, chaffinch, goldfinch, and\r\nothers crush the hemp-seed between their mandibles; the coal-tit grasps\r\nit in its claw, carries it to the beak, and makes in the shell a small\r\nround opening through which it picks out the meat. The hazelnut is\r\nmanaged with the same skill.\r\n\r\n“The blue tit is a beautiful little bird that keeps company with the\r\ncoal-tit and frequents orchards. It is olive-colored above and yellow\r\nunderneath, with the top of the head an azure blue, the forehead white,\r\nand the cheeks white framed in black. A little collar of black also\r\nencircles the back and sides of the neck. The large feathers of the\r\ntail and wings are edged with blue. This titmouse, so elegant in\r\nplumage, so graceful in its bearing, always running about over the bark\r\nof tree trunks and around the branches, always hanging from the\r\nflexible boughs, and always pecking and searching, is no whit inferior\r\nto the coal-tit in its talent for catching caterpillars. It has been\r\nseen in a few hours to clear a rosebush of two thousand plant-lice.\r\nCaterpillars and the eggs of insects, especially of those that attack\r\nfruit, are its chief food. It is very fond of little birds’ brains, but\r\nif need be can get along with hemp-seed. Like the coal-tit, it nests in\r\na hollow tree trunk, its nest being nothing but a heap of small\r\nfeathers. No other species raises a larger family. The eggs are more\r\nthan twenty in number, white with reddish spots, especially at the\r\nlarge end.\r\n\r\n“Two other tomtits, of less value as caterpillar-destroyers, build\r\ntheir nests with much art. They are the long-tailed titmouse and the\r\npenduline.\r\n\r\n“The first of these is different from all other tomtits in the length\r\nof its tail, which forms more than half the length of the body. This\r\nbird lives in the woods during the summer and visits our gardens and\r\norchards only in the winter. It is a small bird, scarcely bigger than a\r\nwren, reddish gray on the back and white underneath, with a tinge of\r\nred on the stomach and with white nape and cheeks.\r\n\r\n“The nest is occasionally built in the fork of some branch in bush or\r\nhedge, a few feet from the ground, but oftener it is attached to the\r\ntrunk of a willow or a poplar. Its shape is that of an elongated oval\r\nor, rather, an enormous cocoon enlarged at the base, with an entrance\r\non the side about an inch from the top. The outside is made of lichens\r\nsuch as grow on old tree trunks, having thus the appearance of bark and\r\ndeceiving the casual observer. Filaments of wool bind the whole\r\ncompactly together. The dome or roof, ingeniously contrived for\r\nshedding rain, is a thick felt of moss and cobweb. The inside is like\r\nan oven with a bowl-shaped bottom and high arched top. Its shape and\r\nthe thick layer of soft feathers lining it make the nest warm and cozy.\r\nFrom sixteen to twenty young birds are packed into the narrow space,\r\nwhich does not exceed the hollow of the hand. By what miracle of\r\norderly arrangement do these twenty little creatures and their mother\r\nmanage to find room for themselves in this tiny abode, and how can\r\ntails of such length develop there? It would be impossible to find\r\nanywhere a more economical use of space.”\r\n\r\n“How I should like to see the twenty little tomtits snuggling together\r\nin that tiny nest!” Emile exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“I have had that good fortune,” said his uncle, “and even now I am\r\nstrangely moved whenever I think of those twenty little heads\r\nstretching up from the bottom of the nest, trembling and with open\r\nbeaks as if their mother had come. I looked for a moment through the\r\nopening of the nest at the tiny creatures, and then withdrew. The\r\nparents were already at hand, ruffling their feathers with anxiety.\r\nFear nothing, little birds, so watchful of your family; Uncle Paul is\r\nnot one to commit the crime of touching your nest.”\r\n\r\n“Nor Emile, either,” chimed in the boy.\r\n\r\n“Nor yet Jules or Louis,” added the last-named.\r\n\r\n“I hope not, indeed; for otherwise Uncle Paul would tell you no more\r\nstories.\r\n\r\n“The penduline’s nest is still more remarkable. This titmouse is found\r\nhardly anywhere except along the banks of the lower Rhone. It hangs its\r\nnest very high, from the tip of some swaying tree branch by the\r\nwaterside, so that its young are gently rocked by the breeze from the\r\nwater. The nest is a sort of oval purse about as large as a quart\r\nbottle and pierced on the side near the top by a narrow opening that\r\nwould hardly admit a man’s thumb. To enter its nest the tomtit, small\r\nthough it is, must stretch the elastic wall, which yields a little and\r\nthen contracts again. This purse-shaped abode is made of the\r\ncotton-like fluff that flies off in May from the ripe catkins of\r\npoplars and willows. The bird gathers this material and then weaves it\r\ntogether with a warp of wool and hemp. The resulting fabric resembles\r\nthe felt of a coarse hat.\r\n\r\n“I am at a loss to understand how the bird manages to weave with its\r\nbeak and claws a stuff superior to any that the unaided human fingers\r\ncould produce; and yet it does this with no instruction, with no\r\nhesitation, and with no hints from the work of others. At its very\r\nfirst attempt the titmouse puts to shame the studied art of our weavers\r\nand fullers. The top or roof of the nest includes in its structure the\r\ntip of the branch from which it hangs and also the little twigs growing\r\nout of that tip end which serve as a framework for the vault; but the\r\nfoliage emerges from the sides of the nest and furnishes shade from the\r\nsun’s heat. Finally, to secure the nest more firmly, cordage of wool\r\nand hemp binds the upper part to the branch and below is worked into\r\nthe woof of the felt. The inside is lined with poplar fluff of the best\r\nquality. It takes a pair of pendulines three weeks of the hardest work\r\nto make this marvel.”\r\n\r\n“Doesn’t the rain ever get through the covering of the nest?” Emile\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n“No; the felt is so thick and so closely woven that even with the\r\nhardest rain not a drop of water can leak into the cotton-lined\r\ninterior.”\r\n\r\n“How comfortable the little birds must be in their snug nest! The wind\r\nrocks them gently over the water, and from their little window they can\r\nsee the river flowing below. What is this clever penduline like?”\r\n\r\n“It is ash-colored, with brown wings and tail, and a black stripe\r\nacross the forehead. Its dress is simple, you see, as is always the\r\ncase with those that possess real merit. The blue tit has rich plumage,\r\nbut when it comes to nest-building it can only pile feathers on top of\r\none another at the bottom of a tree-hollow. The penduline is of modest\r\nappearance, but it builds the most wonderful nest it is possible to\r\nfind. To each his portion, talent or fine clothes.”\r\n\r\n“All of us here choose talent,” declared Jules.\r\n\r\n“Never, my children,” urged Uncle Paul, “be untrue to that sentiment.”\r\n\r\n“We should have to forget your teachings,” the other replied, “before\r\nwe could do that.”\r\n\r\n“And what are the eggs like?” asked Emile.\r\n\r\n“Emile is bound to have all I can tell him about the penduline. Does\r\nthis builder of felt nests interest you, then, so very much?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it does,” Emile assured him.\r\n\r\n“Well, the eggs are quite white and rather long. There are three or\r\nfour of them to a nest.”\r\n\r\n“No more than that, when the other tomtits have twenty?”\r\n\r\n“No more; but to make up for it there are two layings a year.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE WREN AND THE KINGLET\r\n\r\n\r\n“Another highly talented architect, past master in the building of\r\nnests, is the wren, known in learned language as the troglodyte. If you\r\nask me the meaning of this strange name I shall reply that it is a\r\nGreek word signifying ‘dweller in holes.’ Some inventor of names, more\r\nin love with Greek than desirous of being understood, thought he was\r\ndoing a fine thing when he gave this big name to the little bird that\r\nworms its way into small holes as a mouse would. Perhaps my description\r\nwill be more easily understood than his hard name. The troglodyte or\r\nwren is a fluffy bunch of plumage resembling that of the woodcock. With\r\ntrailing wings, beak to windward, and tail erect over its rump, it is\r\nalways frisking and hopping about, uttering the while its cheery cry of\r\nteederee, teeree, teeree.”\r\n\r\n“I know that bird,” Jules broke in. “It isn’t much bigger than a\r\nwalnut, and every winter it comes flying about the house, hunting in\r\nthe woodpile and in holes in the walls, and darting into the thickest\r\nparts of bushes. From a distance you would take it for a bold little\r\nrat.”\r\n\r\n“That is it, that is the wren. In summer it lives in densely grown\r\nwoods. There, under the arch formed by some large upward-curving root\r\ncoated with a thick fleece of moss, it builds a home for itself in\r\nimitation of the penduline’s nest. The materials it uses are bits of\r\nmoss, which make the nest look like its support. It forms them into a\r\nlarge hollow ball with a very narrow opening on one side. It is lined\r\nwith feathers. Occasionally the wren builds its nest in some chimney or\r\na pile of fagots, a thick clump of ivy or a natural cavity in the bank\r\nof a shady stream. The laying consists of about ten white eggs dotted\r\nwith red at the large end.\r\n\r\n“When the weather turns cold, the bird leaves the woods and approaches\r\nour farm-houses. You can see it then, always busy and on the move,\r\nprying into dark holes in woodpiles, old walls, dead trees, and thick\r\nbushes, looking in every crack and cranny for all kinds of vermin that\r\ntake up their winter quarters in the fissures with which old bark is\r\nfurrowed and in the cracks that occur in weather-beaten mortar. To gain\r\nan idea of their unceasing activity in this sort of research, you have\r\nonly to watch them once as they go prying into a heap of brush, flying\r\nin and out on all sides of it without a moment’s pause for rest.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” assented Jules, “but it is so tiny a creature it can’t do much\r\nwork.”\r\n\r\n“If the wren hunted big game, certainly at the end of the day it would\r\nnot have captured its prey by the dozen. What could such a little thing\r\ndo with a June-bug? It would not come to the end of such a supply of\r\nfood for several days.”\r\n\r\n“And the June-bug would be too hard for its beak, too,” remarked Jules.\r\n\r\n“What it needs is the smallest of caterpillars and the tiniest of\r\ngnats, which make a more delicate mouthful and are better adapted to\r\nthe bird’s small throat. I need not remind you that the worst foes to\r\nour crops are the smallest. A grub too tiny to catch the eye endangers\r\nour cereals, and others equally small ravage our fruit while it is\r\nstill in the bud. How much does it take to destroy a blossom that would\r\nproduce a pear the size of your two fists? One single larva just\r\nvisible to the naked eye. Well, the wren attacks these tiny foes of\r\nours that are all the more troublesome because we cannot see them\r\neasily. Now guess how many little caterpillars a day the wren needs for\r\nfeeding its brood. Observers whose patience I admire have calculated\r\nthe number.”\r\n\r\n“Let us say ten caterpillars to each little bird,” replied Jules, “and\r\nten little birds in the nest. That would make a hundred caterpillars a\r\nday, and it is certainly a lot.”\r\n\r\n“A lot! Ah, how far out you are in your reckoning! The mother wren\r\nbrings something to her little ones at least thirty-six times an hour.\r\nShe feeds them a mixed diet of insects, larvæ and eggs. At the end of a\r\nday the number of insects destroyed, of one kind and another, amounts\r\nto one hundred and fifty-six thousand. That leaves your paltry hundred\r\na long way behind, my dear Jules.”\r\n\r\n“Then the caterpillars must be very small, or the brood of wrens would\r\ndie of indigestion.”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly they are exceedingly small, and then a great many are not\r\neven hatched yet; but the result as far as we are concerned is just as\r\nimportant, so many eggs devoured meaning so many ravagers the fewer a\r\nlittle later.”\r\n\r\n“Supposing,” said Louis, “that the wren takes only the worms that\r\nattack pears, that would be one hundred and fifty-six thousand pears\r\nthe little birds would save for us in one day?”\r\n\r\n“Evidently.”\r\n\r\n“But that is beyond belief.”\r\n\r\n“I admit that the result is very great in comparison with the means\r\nemployed. A tiny bird that nobody notices goes pecking here and there,\r\nand we find that at the end of the day the caterpillar-eater has\r\ndestroyed, either in the egg or in the nymph-stage or in the final\r\nform, thousands of insects which, if allowed to live, would have\r\ndeprived us of enormous basketfuls of fruit and hundreds of bushels of\r\ngrain. If we were to estimate the value of the crops saved by\r\ninsectivorous birds, it would be a fabulous sum. Leave them, therefore,\r\nin peace, my children, and do all you can to protect them; for these\r\nbusy little creatures ward off famine from our homes.\r\n\r\n“While we are on the subject let us speak of another little Tom Thumb\r\nof a bird, another caterpillar-destroyer as energetic as the wren. It\r\nis called the kinglet, that is to say, the little king, on account of\r\nthe crown of golden yellow edged with black that encircles its head. It\r\nis the smallest of our birds. It is olive-colored above and\r\nyellowish-white beneath. Its beautiful crown feathers can stand up like\r\na crest.\r\n\r\n“The kinglet breeds in the cold countries of Europe, and especially in\r\nthe fir forests of Norway. Its nest is a little ball no bigger than\r\nyour fist, open at the top, artistically fashioned outside with moss,\r\nwool, and spiders’ webs, and lined with the softest down. It rests flat\r\non some fir branch at an inaccessible height. The eggs, from six to\r\neight in number, are of a uniform flesh color.\r\n\r\n“Although very delicate in appearance, the kinglet stands the cold with\r\ngreat hardihood. It comes to us from the land of its birth in small\r\nflocks when the autumnal fogs are gathering and the leaves are falling.\r\nThese flocks of five or six birds at most scatter through the woods,\r\npublic promenades, and orchards, to examine the cracks in bark, to\r\nexplore the heaps of dead leaves, and to inspect the buds while\r\nclinging to the tips of the smallest branches. Not even the tomtit\r\nshows itself a more expert gymnast in hanging with head downward and\r\nworking in all sorts of attitudes. The task of destroying caterpillars\r\nis accompanied by a continual little rallying cry: zee-zee-zee,\r\nzee-zee-zee.\r\n\r\n“The kinglet has great confidence in mankind. With no sign of fear even\r\nwhen within hearing of the footsteps and conversation of persons\r\nwalking about, it continues its evolutions, its hunting, its\r\nzee-zee-zee. It will let one come close, almost near enough to reach\r\nout a hand and take hold of it. But the knowing little creature,\r\nalthough it appears not to see you because it is so busy, darts\r\nsuddenly away and mounts to the upper branches to carry on its work at\r\na safer distance.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nSWALLOWS\r\n\r\n\r\n“We have whole tribes of helpers that devote themselves to the patient\r\nsearch for insect eggs in the cracks of tree bark and in piles of dead\r\nleaves, for larvæ between the scales of buds and in the worm-holes in\r\nwood, and for insects lurking in narrow crevices where they hide from\r\ntheir pursuers. These invaluable assistants of ours embrace the\r\nmagpies, nuthatches, wrynecks, climbers, tomtits, wrens, kinglets, and\r\nmany others. In the kind of hunting here referred to the bird is not\r\nobliged to chase the game, to vie with it in swiftness; it is enough to\r\nknow how to find it in its hiding-place. For this a sharp eye and a\r\nslender beak are necessary; wings are only of secondary importance.\r\n\r\n“But now we come to other species of birds that hunt in the air, chase\r\ntheir game on the wing, pursuing gnats and flies and butterflies, moths\r\nand mosquitoes and beetles. They require a short beak, but one that\r\nopens very wide and is pretty sure to catch insects as they fly—a beak,\r\nin fine, that may be depended on to work almost of itself and without\r\nan instant’s pause in the bird’s flight; a beak that, above all, is so\r\nsticky inside that as soon as an insect’s wing grazes this viscous\r\nlining it is caught fast in the glue-like substance. The beak of the\r\nbat, that other hunter of insects on the wing, the bat’s beak, I say,\r\nopening from ear to ear, may serve as a model in respect to the width\r\nof its opening. But above all else the hunter must have swift wings\r\nthat never tire, that can fly as fast as the prey which is trying so\r\nhard to escape, that can follow the bewildering zigzags of a moth\r\nmanœuvering to save its life. A cleft beak that opens wide and wings\r\nthat are strong and tireless—such must be the equipment of the bird\r\nthat pursues its prey in the open air.\r\n\r\n“Chief among these hunters is the swallow, which may be called the\r\ndaylight bat, as the bat is the twilight swallow. Both chase flying\r\ninsects, following them in their endless dodgings and doublings and\r\nsnapping them up with yawning beak, then passing on without an\r\ninstant’s delay to the pursuit of others. But how much more pleasing in\r\nappearance, how much swifter in flight is the swallow than that hunter,\r\nthe sad-looking bat! While we may compare their work and their way of\r\nhunting, we cannot compare them in anything else. Buffon quotes Guéneau\r\nde Montbéliard as saying:\r\n\r\n“‘The air is the swallow’s appropriate element, and it is the nature of\r\nthe bird to be ever on the wing. It eats flying, bathes flying, and\r\nsometimes even feeds its young when flying. It glides through the air\r\nwith no effort, with perfect ease, conscious of being in its own\r\ndomain. It explores aërial space in all its dimensions, as if to enjoy\r\nit to the utmost, and its delight in the act is expressed by little\r\ncries of rapture. It may be seen giving chase to flying insects and\r\nfollowing with supple agility their evasive and tortuous course; or it\r\nmay leave one to pursue another and snap up a third in passing; or,\r\nagain, it lightly skims the surface of land and water to catch any that\r\nmay be gathered there for the sake of coolness and moisture; or,\r\nfinally, it may in its turn be driven to flee with all speed before the\r\nlightning-like onset of some bird of prey. Always in full control of\r\nits movements even when flying at topmost speed, it is continually\r\nchanging its course, describing in the air a bewildering maze whose\r\npaths cross, interlace, recede from and approach one another, meet,\r\nwind, ascend, descend, interweave, and mingle in a thousand different\r\nways and after a plan so complicated as to defy representation to the\r\neye by the art of drawing and scarcely to lend itself to description\r\nfor the imagination through the medium of speech.’\r\n\r\n“We have three kinds of swallows in France, of which the best known is\r\nthe martin, black above with glints of blue, and white beneath and on\r\nthe rump. It builds its nest in window-corners, under the eaves of\r\nroofs, and on the cornices of buildings. The materials it uses are fine\r\nsoil, chiefly that which is deposited by earthworms, after digestion,\r\nin little mounds over our fields and gardens. The swallow carries it, a\r\nbeakful at a time, mixes it with a little viscous saliva to make it\r\nstick together, and lays it by courses until it takes the shape of a\r\nhemisphere attached to the wall and provided with a small opening at\r\nthe top. Bits of straw give additional firmness to the masonry; and,\r\nfinally, the interior is lined with an abundance of little feathers.\r\nThe laying consists of four or five pure white eggs without any spots.\r\n\r\n“The nests are used year after year by the same pairs of birds, being\r\nrecognized by them on their annual return in the spring and made as\r\ngood as new with a few repairs. If some are left vacant by reason of\r\nthe owners’ death in distant lands, new couples profit by the fact.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t they ever quarrel over the old nests?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“Very seldom. Swallows like to live in colonies, and their nests touch\r\none another sometimes to the number of hundreds on the same cornice.\r\nEach couple recognizes its own nest without the slightest hesitation,\r\nand scrupulously respects others’ property in order to have its own\r\nrespected. There is among them a deep feeling of joint responsibility,\r\nand they help one another with as much intelligence as zeal.\r\nOccasionally it happens that a nest is no sooner finished than it gives\r\nway, either because the mortar used is not strong enough or because the\r\nmasons were in too great a hurry and had not the patience to let one\r\ncourse dry before laying another, or for some other reason. On hearing\r\nof the disaster the neighbors hasten to console the unlucky pair and\r\nhelp them to rebuild. All set to work, bringing the best mortar, straw,\r\nand feathers, and in forty-eight hours the nest is rebuilt. Left to\r\nthemselves, it would have taken the owners a fortnight to repair the\r\ndamage.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the kind of friends in need I like to see!” declared Emile.\r\n\r\n“But I have something still better to tell you. Let us suppose a\r\nswallow has been so careless as to become entangled in a mesh of loose\r\nthreads, and the more frantically it struggles to escape the more\r\nfirmly it binds its fetters. With wings and claws held fast it is in\r\ndanger of perishing. Uttering piteous cries, it calls on its comrades\r\nfor help. All hasten to give aid, noisily making plans for relief and\r\nworking away with beak and talons until they finally unsnarl the tangle\r\nand free the captive. The happy event is then celebrated with chirpings\r\nof delight. That is what I saw with my own eyes, right here in the\r\ngarden, one day when Mother Ambroisine was bleaching some of the linen\r\nthread she spins on her distaff.\r\n\r\n“An author [6] of note tells us that he once witnessed something\r\nsimilar. These are his words: ‘I saw a swallow that had unfortunately,\r\nI know not how, caught its foot in a slip-knot tied in a string, the\r\nother end of which was fastened to a roof gutter. The bird’s strength\r\nwas exhausted and it hung, crying, from the end of the string, with an\r\noccasional effort to escape. All the swallows in the neighborhood had\r\nassembled, to the number of several thousand. They formed a veritable\r\ncloud, each one uttering cries of alarm and pity. After considerable\r\nhesitation one of them hit on a plan for freeing their luckless\r\ncompanion and communicated it to the others, whereupon they all set to\r\nwork. A space was cleared and every swallow within hail came, one after\r\nanother, as in a ring-game, and gave in passing a peck at the string.\r\nThese blows, all delivered at the same point, followed one another with\r\nonly a second’s interval or less. Half an hour of this work sufficed to\r\nsever the thread and liberate the prisoner. But the entire company of\r\nbirds, with a few exceptions, stayed there until night, chattering away\r\nincessantly, though no longer in anxious tones, but rather as if in\r\nmutual congratulation and animated comment.’\r\n\r\n“Again: ‘An insolent sparrow invades a swallow’s nest and likes it so\r\nwell it wishes to stay. The owners assail the intruder, but the latter,\r\nhaving a stronger beak and being also protected by the ramparts of the\r\nnest, easily repulses their attacks. Ha! so you won’t budge, then?\r\nWe’ll see about that. One of the two swallows remains to hold the\r\nblockade while the other goes for help. The neighbors hasten to the\r\nspot, consider the situation, deliberate on means to be employed, and\r\nfinally conclude that it is out of the question to hope to dislodge by\r\nforce an enemy so securely entrenched in the nest as in a strong\r\nredoubt. There is but one opinion: the invader cannot be ousted from\r\nthe nest, but the proprietors must at least be avenged. No sooner said\r\nthan done. While a few courageous ones posted at the opening intimidate\r\nthe interloper with their cries, the others fetch a supply of their\r\nusual mortar, soil moistened with saliva, and little by little close\r\nthe entrance to the nest.’”\r\n\r\n“Who was the fool that time?” cried Jules, in high delight.\r\n\r\n“It certainly was the sparrow, sealed up in its narrow prison and left\r\nto perish.”\r\n\r\n“Caught, you nest-robber!” Emile exclaimed, clapping his hands.\r\n\r\n“The chimney-swallow or house-swallow, also called barn-swallow, has\r\nchestnut-red forehead, throat, and eyebrows, a black back with violet\r\nsheen, and a white breast and stomach. Its name of house-swallow is\r\ngiven to it because it seeks man’s neighborhood and even nests inside\r\nour houses, especially where there is but little commotion or noise.\r\nOpen and empty rooms, sheds and coach-houses, the eaves of roofs, the\r\nunder side of balcony floors, and the inside of tall chimneys are its\r\nchosen nesting-places. The nest itself is made of moistened clay mixed\r\nwith straw and hay and furnished inside with feathers and dry grass. It\r\nis in the shape of a half-cup wide open at the top. The eggs are five\r\nin number, white with small brown and violet spots.\r\n\r\n“The house-swallow is the most interesting of the tribe. It is the\r\nfarmer’s cheery companion and the guest of the barn, while the martin\r\nprefers towns and the cornices of monuments. Its characteristic cry is\r\na sweet little song which the father, perched on the edge of the nest,\r\nkeeps repeating to the brooding mother to beguile the long hours of\r\nincubation. This bird is found all over the world. It reaches us after\r\na long migration about the first of April, twelve days before the\r\nmartin and a month ahead of the swift.\r\n\r\n“The sand-martin is smaller and of less frequent occurrence than the\r\nother two swallows of which we are speaking. Its back is mouse-gray in\r\ncolor, as are also its cheeks and a wide stripe across the chest, while\r\nbreast and stomach are pure white. With its beak and claws—poor tools\r\nfor such rough work did not energetic good will supply the\r\ndeficiency—it tunnels into steep sand-banks by the waterside, or into\r\nthe face of cliffs and the walls of quarries, making a hole with a\r\nnarrow entrance and extending in a winding passage for nearly two feet.\r\nAt the further end a little space is hollowed out and furnished with a\r\nthick bed of straw, dry grass, and feathers, all heaped together with\r\nno art. There are laid five or six slightly translucent white eggs. The\r\nsand-martin perches only on rocks, to which it clings easily with its\r\nlong and pointed claws. It haunts the water’s edge, which it explores\r\nin rapid flight, darting to and fro and snapping up the gnats attracted\r\nby the coolness.”\r\n\r\n“It is said,” remarked Jules, “that swallows take long journeys.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, all our swallows migrate every year, not from a love of wandering\r\nbut from necessity. Many other birds, particularly those that live on\r\ninsects, do the same. Swallows, like bats, live entirely on flying\r\ninsects, and when cold weather comes these are lacking. What does the\r\nbat do then to keep from starving?”\r\n\r\n“It goes to sleep,” answered Emile.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it closes as tightly as it can the draft in the vital stove—that\r\nnatural stove, you know, that gives us heat, movement, and animation by\r\nburning up our blood with the help of air. The bat almost stops its\r\nbreath in order to economize the fuel stored up in its little veins and\r\nmake it last until the reappearance of insects at the approach of\r\nsummer. In a word, it goes to sleep in the depths of some grotto,\r\nfalling into an unconsciousness resembling death. Birds, however,\r\ncannot thus save their fuel. Their little stoves are always burning\r\naway under forced draft, because of the violent exercise of flying.\r\nTheir temperature, summer and winter, is forty-two degrees, centigrade,\r\nwhereas man’s is only thirty-eight. When such a fire has to be kept\r\ngoing, imagine if you can take a six months’ nap because there was\r\nnothing to eat in the larder. It is quite out of the question. What,\r\nthen, do birds do?\r\n\r\n“Unable to do as the bat does, they form a bold resolve: they leave\r\ntheir native land, which is about to be stripped of flying insects by\r\nthe cold, and go far away, sad to leave but not without the hope of\r\nreturning some day. They migrate, the strong helping the weak, the old\r\nand much-traveled ones guiding the young and inexperienced. They form\r\nin flocks and fly southward to Africa, where abundant food and a warmer\r\nsun await them. With no compass but instinct to direct their course,\r\nthey cross the sea, the vast expanse of water in which only an\r\noccasional islet offers them a halting-place. Many perish in the\r\ncrossing, and many arrive faint with hunger and spent with fatigue, but\r\nthey do arrive at last.”\r\n\r\n“It must be a trying time for the swallows when the day for starting\r\ncomes,” Jules observed.\r\n\r\n“A very trying time indeed, for the bird has to tear itself away from\r\nits beloved haunts, the place where it was born, to face the fatigues\r\nand dangers of a tremendous journey, a journey never before taken by\r\nthe greater number of the emigrants. In a general assembly the date of\r\ndeparture is fixed for about the end of August in the case of martins\r\nand sand-martins, and later, even as late as October, for\r\nhouse-swallows. This being arranged, the martins gather for several\r\nsuccessive days on the roofs of high buildings. Every now and then\r\nsmall groups detach themselves from the rest and circle about in the\r\nair with anxious cries, taking a last look at their birthplace and\r\nbidding it farewell; then they return to their companions and, we may\r\nimagine, fall to chattering about their hopes and fears as they prepare\r\nfor the journey by a careful examination of their plumage, which they\r\noil a feather at a time. After several repetitions of these touching\r\nfarewells a plaintive twittering announces the fateful hour: they must\r\nstart. Launching themselves on their desperate adventure, they take\r\nflight in a body toward the south.\r\n\r\n“House-swallows, when the time for their departure approaches, hold a\r\nconsultation on some leafless tree, and almost always in the rain. The\r\nemigrating flock numbers three or four hundred birds.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nSWIFTS AND NIGHT-JARS\r\n\r\n\r\n“The swift is that large black swallow that flies in flocks on summer\r\nevenings and utters a shrill cry as it passes. Hunting insects on the\r\nwing is its occupation. It has a very short beak that opens wide, a big\r\ngullet, always coated with a glue that holds the captured game, long\r\nand pointed wings which enable it to cover in continuous flight eighty\r\nleagues an hour, and piercing eyes capable of seeing a gnat at a\r\nhundred meters’ distance, or even farther. Every insect that ventures\r\ninto the upper air is lost: the swift’s open beak is a living trap, a\r\ntrap that advances rapidly to swallow up the tiny prey.\r\n\r\n“If the bird has little ones, it sometimes stows away its prey in its\r\ncheek-pouches and, when they are full, returns to its nest to feed\r\nthese provisions to the hungry mouths waiting to be filled, discharging\r\nthrough its beak the accumulated flies, moths, and beetles.\r\n\r\n“What a slaughter of twilight-flying insects takes place when the\r\nscreaming flocks of swifts fly hither and thither, circling about in\r\nthe calm glow of sunset! What an onrush of whirring wings! What dash\r\nand eagerness! How animated the scene! Some fly merely as chance\r\ndictates, letting themselves glide gently through the air for the mere\r\npleasure of the motion; others describe intertwining circles without\r\nnumber; others, again, soar aloft on motionless wings or let themselves\r\nfall from dizzy heights as if wounded and helpless; still others follow\r\na straight course, racing toward some distant goal and then returning\r\nfor a fresh start; and, finally, there are those that go whirling in\r\nnoisy companies about some lofty building. But what of this one that\r\ndarts across our vision in such hot haste? It flashes past with three\r\nstrokes of the wings and is lost in the haze of the distance. What\r\nimpetuosity, children, what amazing speed!”\r\n\r\n“I have often wished I could fly when I was watching those birds,” said\r\nEmile. “If I only had their wings to carry me to those blue mountains\r\nwe see from here, how I should like to go flying to the top of that\r\nhighest peak and then come back as quickly as I went!”\r\n\r\n“That wish, my boy, is common to us all; every one must envy the swift\r\nits wings, but certainly no one would ever think of envying it its\r\nfeet.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because they are so misshapen and the legs are so short that they\r\ncannot be used for walking. All four toes point forward. That tells you\r\nthe swift does not perch, being unable to grasp the supporting branch,\r\nbut must cling to walls for a brief rest, after which it must take\r\nflight again, starting with a falling movement as bats do. Guéneau de\r\nMontbéliard tells us this:\r\n\r\n“‘Swifts have to be on the wing a great part of the time. They never\r\nvoluntarily alight on the ground, and if by some accident they fall to\r\nearth they cannot rise again into the air without extreme difficulty,\r\nby dragging themselves up on to a little mound or by climbing with beak\r\nand claws upon a stone from which they can spread their long wings. If\r\nthe ground is quite level they either lie prone on the stomach or sway\r\nfrom side to side with a balancing motion, or they manage to struggle\r\nforward a little by beating the earth with their wings. After repeated\r\nefforts they sometimes succeed in flying off. The earth, therefore, is\r\nto them a great danger that must be avoided with the utmost care. Any\r\nstate between swift motion and absolute rest is hardly possible with\r\nthem. Violent exercise in the air and perfect quiet in their place of\r\nretreat—these two, as a rule, make up their existence. The only\r\nvariation known to them is to hang on to some wall near their hole and\r\nthen drag themselves into the nest by clambering along with the help of\r\nbeak and any chance support that they can find. Usually they enter\r\ntheir retreat in full flight. After passing and repassing its entrance\r\nmore than a hundred times, all at once they dart in so quickly that\r\nthey are lost to sight before you know whither they are gone. You feel\r\nalmost inclined to believe they have vanished into thin air.’\r\n\r\n“Their nest is nearly always placed in a deep hole in the wall and at a\r\ngreat height. It is made of hemp threads, little wisps of tow, bits of\r\nstraw, feathers, rags, and cotton-like down from poplar and willow\r\ncatkins. These materials are stuck together with the viscous saliva\r\nthat constantly oozes from the swift’s throat and serves as glue to\r\nentangle captured insects. The bird spreads it over the nest and\r\nthoroughly moistens the successive layers. In drying this saliva\r\nhardens and takes on the shiny appearance of gum, giving consistency\r\nand even elasticity to the whole structure. If you squeeze the nest\r\nbetween your two hands it will shrink up without breaking, and when the\r\npressure is removed it will resume its former shape.\r\n\r\n“The swift, then, furnishes its own adhesive cement, but whence does it\r\nobtain the other materials it needs, such as tow, rags, straw, and\r\nfeathers? Of course it is not so foolish as to go and pick them up from\r\nthe ground, where it might find them as other birds do; for if it\r\ntouched the ground it would certainly come to grief. Therefore it\r\nresorts to cunning. As it reaches us rather late in the season, it\r\ntakes advantage of such holes as it finds already abandoned by the\r\nsparrows, and there it finds abundant materials which it uses in its\r\nown way by sticking them together with its glue. If the sparrows have\r\nnot yet broken up housekeeping, it boldly invades their nests, steals\r\nbits of flock and tufts of hair, straw, and feathers, a little from one\r\nand a little from another, and makes with these its own nest in another\r\nhole in the same wall. The female lays from two to four eggs, pure\r\nwhite and rather elongated. Swifts seldom stay more than three months\r\nwith us. Arriving after the swallows early in May, they leave at the\r\nend of July.\r\n\r\n“The white-breasted swift differs from the bird I have just described\r\nin being larger and having a white breast and stomach. It is found in\r\nthe region of the Alps and of the Pyrenees and frequents the\r\nMediterranean shores, especially where the waves beat against high,\r\nsteep cliffs. Middle and northern Europe are not visited by this bird.\r\nIts flight is even swifter than that of its black cousin, and it flies\r\nhabitually at a great height, descending only when bad weather\r\nthreatens. It builds its nest at the summit of high, steep rocks,\r\nmaking it of straw and moss stuck together with the glue from its own\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\n“The night-jar closely resembles the swift, having, like that bird, a\r\nshort beak which is very broad at the base and opens very wide, while\r\nfrom the gullet comes a sticky saliva for holding fast any insects that\r\nare caught. Its size is about that of the thrush; its plumage is light,\r\nsoft, and shaded with gray and brown; its eyes are large and prominent\r\nand very sensitive to light; the base of its beak bristles with long,\r\nstiff hairs; and its legs are short, but at the same time not ill\r\nadapted to walking.\r\n\r\n“As indicated by the sensitiveness of its eyes, which cannot endure the\r\nfull light of day, and by the softness and lightness and gray color of\r\nits plumage, which resembles that of the hornless owl, the night-jar is\r\na twilight bird: it is the swift of the evening, flying and hunting\r\nonly when the sun is near setting. By the fading light of a summer\r\nevening it may be seen scanning the ground in low flight to and fro\r\nover its surface, after the manner of the swallow. It flies with mouth\r\nwide open, so that the air in striking the throat produces a low and\r\ncontinuous humming like that of a spinning-wheel.”\r\n\r\n“And is it from that humming sound that it gets its name of night-jar?”\r\nasked Jules.\r\n\r\n“Precisely. But it does not make this humming sound for the mere love\r\nof hearing it; its object is to snap up the twilight-flying insects as\r\nit passes with distended beak. Big beetles sporting in the evening air,\r\nJune-bugs, and other plump winged creatures disappear in the viscous\r\ngullet, while small butterflies, moths, gnats, and mosquitoes become\r\nentangled by the dozen in the fatal glue. If the game is large, the\r\nbird swallows it at once, whole and still alive; if small, it waits\r\nuntil it has caught a certain number and then swallows them all in one\r\nmouthful.”\r\n\r\n“But does it really swallow big beetles and June-bugs alive?” Emile\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“You can readily understand that in its headlong chase the bird has no\r\ntime to dismember its captives. Pouncing upon the insect with wide-open\r\nbeak, snapping it up, and gulping it down—all this it does as it flies,\r\nwithout a moment’s pause. No sooner is the plumpest prey captured than\r\ndown it goes, alive and struggling, into the bird’s crop.”\r\n\r\n“A dozen of that sort of game must stir up a big rumpus in the bird’s\r\ncrop,” was Emile’s opinion.\r\n\r\n“Almost any other creature in the night-jar’s place would have its\r\ndigestion ruined by a brisk company of coleopters kicking about in the\r\nstomach and tickling its walls with their rough and prickly legs; but I\r\nam inclined to believe the bird has the means of quieting them\r\nimmediately by smothering them with its digestive juices. As it carries\r\non the business of stuffing its crop with large live beetles, it ought\r\nto know the secret of how to prevent their making a hole in its\r\nstomach. But that does not lessen my admiration for its digestive\r\npowers. No creature enjoys a more remarkable immunity from dyspepsia.\r\n\r\n“On a near view the night-jar is not a pretty bird. Its flat skull; its\r\ntremendously yawning beak, which seems to split the whole head in two;\r\nits wide-open gullet, red and slimy and powdered with the remains of\r\nmoths recently devoured; its large and prominent eyes—all these give it\r\nsomewhat the appearance of a toad. That is why it is sometimes called\r\nthe flying toad. Another common name for it is goat-sucker, based on a\r\nfalse belief as to one of its habits. It likes to visit pastures and\r\nsheepfolds, where it chases the beetles to be found there. Noting its\r\nfrequent appearance among the sheep and goats, shepherds imagined it\r\ncame there to suck their milk. If they had watched it more closely they\r\nwould have seen the absurdity of any such notion. A bird suck? What\r\nnonsense! But the more ridiculous an idea is, the more likely it is to\r\nspread, and the absurd name of goat-sucker is better known in many\r\nplaces than the appropriate and expressive one of night-jar.\r\n\r\n“This bird comes to us from warmer lands toward the beginning of May,\r\nand leaves us in September. It builds no nest, imitating in this\r\nvarious nocturnal birds of prey. Some hole in the ground or among\r\nbroken stones, at the foot of a tree or a rock, and usually taken just\r\nas it happens to be, suffices to hold the bird’s eggs, which are two or\r\nthree in number, white with tawny and bluish spots.\r\n\r\n“In closing let me beg you to remember what we owe these big-throated\r\nbirds that hunt insects on the wing, and more especially the swifts and\r\nswallows, who defend our granaries and gardens, our wardrobes and our\r\nvery persons. What would you think of any one who, possessing the\r\nterrible secret of creating by the bushel moths, gnats, mosquitoes,\r\nweevils, and other destructive insects, should let loose a swarm of\r\nthese creatures in the air about us?”\r\n\r\n“I should say hanging was too good for him,” answered Louis.\r\n\r\n“But that is exactly what any one does who kills a swallow. It is true\r\nhe does not create moths and mosquitoes and other insects, but he saves\r\nthe lives of those that the swallow would have eaten, and thus he is\r\nguilty of as grave an offense as if he had created them on purpose to\r\nturn them loose on us. He does a wicked deed, for he receives with\r\ndeadly shotgun the pretty, joyous creature, messenger of spring and\r\nsunshine, that comes trustfully asking his hospitality and the\r\npermission to build its nest under the eaves of his house. He causes\r\nfamine, for he encourages the multiplication of those devouring hordes\r\nthat levy every year on our farm products a tax that amounts to\r\nthousands of millions of francs in its total sum and is constantly\r\nincreasing as insect-eating birds decrease. A wicked deed, I say, a\r\ndeed which causes famine—that is what is really done by the murderer of\r\nswallows.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nTHE BIRD’S BEAK\r\n\r\n\r\n“There are many other small birds that live almost exclusively on\r\ninsects, and in so doing render a great service to agriculture. A full\r\naccount of them all would take too long; and, besides, you are familiar\r\nwith the greater number, seeing them daily in the woods, fields,\r\norchards, and gardens. I will confine myself, therefore, to the chief\r\ndifference between insect-eaters and birds that live on seeds and\r\ngrain; and then a glance at some of the habits of the most important\r\nspecies will complete our rapid review.\r\n\r\n“The food of small birds falls into two classes, seeds and insects.\r\nCertain birds require millet, hemp-seed, pips, and similar seeds of all\r\nkinds, while others need grubs, larvæ, insects. The choice of one or\r\nthe other sort of food is determined by the shape of the beak, just as\r\na mammal’s diet depends on the structure of the animal’s teeth. The\r\nmolars of the horse and the ox call for forage to grind under their\r\nflat, wide crowns; but those of the wolf and the cat, with their sharp\r\nedges, need flesh to cut to pieces. In the same manner the bird’s beak,\r\naccording to whether it is shaped this way or that, whether large or\r\nsmall, thick or slender, strong or weak, requires hard seeds that crack\r\nunder the mandibles and in opening yield their kernels, or the tender\r\ngrub that is swallowed without having to be crushed. Show me your\r\nteeth, we said to the mammal, and I shall know what you eat. Show me\r\nyour beak, we might now say to the bird, and I shall know whether you\r\nlive on insects or seeds.\r\n\r\n“The beak of the bird that lives on seeds or grain—that is, the\r\ngranivorous bird—is thick, conical, wide at the base, and strong in\r\nproportion to the hardness of the seeds it has to crack open; but the\r\nbeak of the bird that lives on insects—that is, the insectivorous\r\nbird—is thin, slender, delicate, and weak in proportion to the softness\r\nof the insects it catches. In our everyday speech we note this\r\ndifference by applying to the small granivorous birds the general\r\ndesignation grosbeak, while the insect-eaters are often called\r\nslender-beaked birds. Let us remember these two expressive words and\r\nformulate the general principle thus: Seeds for the grosbeak, worms for\r\nthe slender beak.\r\n\r\n“And now without further delay we will put the rule into practice. Here\r\nis a bird whose diet is perhaps a matter of uncertainty to you. If I\r\nask you what, to judge from the shape of its beak, is its customary\r\nfood, shall you be at a loss how to reply?”\r\n\r\n“That strong beak, so wide at the base, must be meant for crunching the\r\nvery hardest seeds,” was Jules’s opinion.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Emile chimed in, “that bird certainly lives on seeds; it is\r\nwritten all over its big face.”\r\n\r\n“It is, indeed, a consumer of all kinds of seeds; it is the greenfinch\r\nof our copses, greenish underneath and with a yellow border to its\r\ntail. The dominant color of its costume, green mixed with yellow, has\r\ngiven it the name of greenfinch. And this one?”\r\n\r\n“Seeds for the grosbeak, worms for the slender beak,” repeated Emile.\r\n“The beak has no strength; it is rather long but thin; the bird is an\r\ninsect-eater.”\r\n\r\n“And one of the greediest, for it belongs to the family of warblers,\r\nthose delightful songsters that would be afraid of getting hoarse if\r\nthey ate dry, farinaceous grain. To keep their vocal cords flexible\r\nthese artists must have the gentle lubricant furnished by caterpillars\r\nand the succulent flesh of larvæ. They take good heed not to touch\r\ncoarse seeds, which would injure the voice. This bird is the\r\nreed-warbler, which lives on dragon-flies, small June-bugs, mosquitoes,\r\nand horse-flies, snapping them up on the wing. It builds its nest among\r\nthe reeds in willow thickets. It is reddish brown above and yellowish\r\nwhite underneath.\r\n\r\n“Finally, let us look at this third one.”\r\n\r\n“Another slender beak,” said Emile; “another insect-eater.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; you see it isn’t difficult. The bird has three names among us:\r\nwasherwoman, wagtail, and little shepherdess. Washerwoman, because it\r\nfrequents the waterside in company with those that wash linen; wagtail,\r\nbecause it wags its tail at every step it takes; and little\r\nshepherdess, because it likes the society of shepherds and flocks. It\r\nis ash-colored above, white underneath, and black on the back of the\r\nhead and also on the throat and breast.\r\n\r\n“Wagtails go hopping along in a lively manner over the sand at the\r\nwater’s edge, looking for little worms. Every now and then they fly up\r\na few feet into the air, balance, pirouette, and alight again on some\r\nslight elevation. They may also be seen skipping across the fields\r\namong the sheep and standing on the backs of the latter even in the\r\nshepherd’s presence, in order to get the parasitic insects lurking\r\nunder the wool. They live on small slugs, moths, flies, and larvæ.\r\n\r\n“Midway between birds eating only seeds and those eating only insects\r\nmust be placed, in respect to their food, those that have a mixed diet\r\nand eat, according to season, place, and circumstances, insects and\r\nseeds, larvæ and berries. Their beak has neither a strong, conical\r\nstructure like that of purely granivorous birds, nor a delicately\r\nslender form like the beak of the insect-eaters, but is between these\r\ntwo extremes. This beak, instrument of general utility, is found in the\r\nlark, that bringer of gladness to our plowed fields; in the thrush and\r\nthe blackbird, lovers of grapes and juniper-berries, but not less fond\r\nof insects; in the oriole, that superb black and yellow bird so\r\nappreciative of cherries flavored with toothsome larvæ; and in the\r\nstarling, devourer of figs, grapes, insects, slugs, and various kinds\r\nof seeds.\r\n\r\n“The starling is a magnificent bird almost as large as a blackbird,\r\nbrilliant with glints of metallic luster on a dark background. Its\r\ncolor is black with greenish sheen on head and wings and violet on\r\nbreast and back. Most of the feathers are adorned with a reddish-white\r\nspot at the very end. It nests under the roofs of buildings, in\r\ndove-cotes, and in hollow tree trunks. The nest, composed on the\r\noutside of straw, and within of dry grasses and feathers, contains four\r\nspotless whitish eggs. Starlings come to us in the autumn. They fly in\r\nlarge flocks, whirling about like grain winnowed in a sieve and sending\r\nforth piercing cries from high up in the air. They alight in marshes\r\nand damp meadows, where they destroy much vermin.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nINSECTIVOROUS BIRDS\r\n\r\n\r\n“Now let us go back to the principal slender-beaked birds, eaters of\r\ninsects only and consequently our greatest helpers. They are all small\r\nin size, delicately and gracefully formed, and modest in dress. Among\r\nthem we find the sweet singers that make the woods echo in spring with\r\nthe refreshing songs of the opening season.\r\n\r\n“First there is the nightingale, clothed all in brown except the under\r\nparts, which are whitish in color. Listen to it some calm evening in\r\nMay. All is quiet, so we need not lose a note of the bird’s hymn. It\r\nbegins with a few timid and tentative phrases, thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Teoo-oo, teoo-oo, teoo-oo, teoo-oo,\r\n        Shpe, teoo-oo, tokooa.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen it becomes more animated:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Teo, teo, teo, teo, teo,\r\n        Koo-oo-teoo, koo-oo-teoo, koo-oo-teoo, koo-oo-teoo, Tskoo-o,\r\n        tskoo-o, tskoo-o, tskoo-o,\r\n        Tsee-ee, tsee-ee, tsee-ee, tsee-ee, tsee-ee, tsee-ee.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere the phrasing becomes more marked, the melody quicker:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Dlo, dlo, dlo, dlo, dlo, dlo,\r\n        Koo-e-oo, trrrrrrritz!\r\n        Lu-lu-lu, le-le-le-le, lee-lee-lee-lee.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnthusiasm then bursts all bounds and the bird indulges in the most\r\nbrilliant roulades; but our harsh alphabet is powerless to show the\r\nsounds that come from this wonderful throat.\r\n\r\n“‘The nightingale,’ says Buffon, ‘begins with a timid prelude in weak\r\nand almost wavering tones, as if wishing to try its instrument and win\r\nthe attention of those within hearing; but presently, gaining\r\nassurance, it gradually becomes animated and displays all the resources\r\nof its incomparable organ. Bursts of melody, lively volleys of rippling\r\nsong in which clearness is equaled only by volubility, low and\r\nvoiceless murmurs inaudible to the listener, but calculated to increase\r\nthe brilliance of the notes about to be heard, vivid and rapid trills\r\nthat sweep the gamut and are articulated with force and even with a\r\ncertain hardness of effect not unpleasing to the ear, plaintive\r\ncadences softly modulated, notes struck without art but full of soul,\r\nenchanting and poignant chords that seem to come from the very heart\r\nand to convey a touching significance—such are the impassioned strains\r\nby which, in a tongue doubtless full of sentiment, this natural\r\nsongster appears to try to charm its mate or, rather, to contend before\r\nher with his jealous rivals for the prize of supreme excellence in\r\nsong.’\r\n\r\n“I have seen unfeeling barbarians cut short this pretty romance with a\r\nshot from a gun. They say that half a dozen nightingales make an\r\nexcellent broiled dish. Horrors! What a frightful brute is man when he\r\nthinks of nothing but his stomach!\r\n\r\n“The nightingale builds its nest in bushes and rather near the ground,\r\nsometimes even among the roots. Coarse grasses and oak leaves are used\r\nfor the outside, tufts of fleece and horsehair for the inside. The\r\nfemale lays five dark-green eggs.\r\n\r\n“With the nightingale, though less wonderful as singers, are to be\r\nclassed the warblers, thirty or more species of which can be counted in\r\nEurope. All live on flies, caterpillars, small beetles, spiders, and\r\nlarvæ of various kinds. Their nests are constructed with much art. Some\r\nnest in trees and hedges in our gardens; others prefer thickets and\r\nlonely groves; still others choose holes in tree trunks and walls.\r\nOthers, again, build on piling that projects above the water in\r\nmarshes; that is, they unite three or four slender reeds with a\r\nligature and build their nest on this swaying support. Others, finally,\r\ncontent themselves with a little hole in the ground. Among the\r\nbest-known of these birds is the black-capped warbler, so named on\r\naccount of the black hood that covers the top of the head and the nape\r\nof the neck. You remember it is one of the cuckoo’s victims, as was\r\nproved by the egg found a few days ago, in the nest at the foot of the\r\ngarden. Then we must include the babbling warbler, lover of copses,\r\norchards, and gardens; the little red warbler, which visits our\r\nfruit-trees and says, zip-zap, zip-zap, zip-zap; the marsh-warbler,\r\nwhich builds its nest among the marsh reeds; and the Alpine warbler,\r\nguest of chalets and tuneful songster of high, snowy mountains.\r\n\r\n“Now let us look at the fallow-finch or whitetail, which flies from\r\nclod to clod in our fallow fields (whence its name of fallow-finch),\r\nand in flying spreads its white tail, a target for the huntsman and the\r\nreason for its second name. It is ash-colored on the back and reddish\r\nwhite underneath, with black wings and eyebrows. It frequents\r\ncultivated fields to catch the grubs turned up by the plow. Its nest,\r\nplaced under a clod of turf, amid a pile of stones, or in a hole in\r\nsome dry wall, is made of moss, grass, and feathers. The eggs, five or\r\nsix in number, are light blue. The fallow-finch’s chosen haunts are\r\ndry, rocky uplands, where it may be seen in the autumn in large flocks,\r\nflying from one rock to another and from one clod to another, keeping\r\nclose to the ground.\r\n\r\n“By the fallow-finch’s side let us place the stonechat, a little,\r\nlively, active bird always seen perched on the topmost branch of a bush\r\nor bramble, where it repeats, with frisky movements, its short cry of\r\nooistratra, ooistratra. If from this place of observation it sees an\r\ninsect on the ground, it flies down, seizes it, and returns in a trice\r\nto its perch by a short curving flight like that so characteristic of\r\nthe shrike. Its plumage is brown, with red breast and black throat. The\r\nsides of the neck, together with the wings and the rump, are ornamented\r\nwith white. Stonechats frequent hedges that border sown fields and dry\r\npastures, and are never seen, any more than are fallow-finches, in damp\r\nlands along the banks of rivers. They build their nests, in which they\r\nlay five or six greenish-blue eggs, among the roots of bushes, in\r\ncrevices in rocks, and among piles of stones.\r\n\r\n“I should count it almost a crime to omit here the robin redbreast, in\r\nmy opinion the most pleasing of our smaller birds in its wide-awake\r\nmanner, its gentle look, and its friendly curiosity, which makes it\r\ncome and pick up the shepherd’s crumbs when he is eating his lunch. At\r\nthe first dawn of day it begins its lively song, uttering now and then\r\na note or two that recall certain parts of the nightingale’s more\r\nelaborate performance. Who does not know its alert cry from the depths\r\nof some clump of bushes, treet, tee-ree-tee-teet, tee-reet,\r\ntee-ree-tee-teet, and its call to some passing member of its kin,\r\noo-eep, oo-eep?\r\n\r\n“The redbreast is greenish brown above, bright red on the throat and\r\nbreast, and white on the stomach. It nests in the densest woods amid\r\nthe moss-grown tree roots, and its nest, made of leaves, horsehair,\r\ntufts of wool, and feathers, contains from five to seven whitish eggs\r\nspotted with red.\r\n\r\n“In winter the redbreast leaves the forest, draws near our farms, and\r\neven ventures into our houses in quest of food. God forbid, boys, that\r\nyou should ever betray its confidence when, on a stormy winter’s day,\r\nit comes discreetly tapping with its beak on the window-pane, asking\r\nhospitality. Welcome the poor little famished creature, and it will pay\r\nyou a hundred times over with its gentle warbling and its zeal in\r\ndefending the fruits of the earth.\r\n\r\n“But enough about the slender-beaks. You ought by this time to\r\nappreciate the immense help we receive from these legions of\r\ninsect-eaters which share the work of the fields, hedges, meadows,\r\ngardens, woods, and orchards, and wage incessant warfare on every sort\r\nof vermin that would destroy our harvests unless others than ourselves\r\nwere constantly on the watch—others cleverer and endowed with sharper\r\neyesight and greater patience for the unending hunt, and also having\r\nnothing else to do. I am not exaggerating, I assure you; without our\r\ninsectivorous birds we should soon suffer from famine. Who, then,\r\nexcept an idiot with a mania for destruction, would dare touch the\r\nnests of these birds of the good God that enliven the country-side with\r\ntheir varied plumage and protect us from insects? There are, I well\r\nknow, unruly boys who, tired of their books and lessons, delight to\r\nplay truant and make a pastime of climbing trees and searching hedges\r\nin order to toss the new-born birds out of their nests to a miserable\r\ndeath and to smash the eggs. The rural guard is on the watch for these\r\nwicked thieves, and the law punishes them, that our fields and orchards\r\nmay enjoy the birds’ protection and continue to produce their sheaves\r\nand their fruit.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nGRANIVOROUS BIRDS\r\n\r\n\r\n“It might at first seem that I ought to be as lenient toward those who\r\nhunt granivorous birds as I have just shown myself severe toward the\r\ndestroyers of insectivorous birds; for can it be denied that birds\r\ngiven to a vegetable diet are harmful to our crops, that they plunder\r\nour grain-fields and devour great quantities of seeds, buds, fruit, and\r\nyoung garden plants? Some of them know how to extract the wheat grains\r\nfrom the ear, and others boldly come to get their share of the oats\r\nthrown to the poultry in our barnyards. Others, again, prefer the juicy\r\nflesh of fruit and know before we do when cherries are ripe or pears\r\nare mellow, so that when we come to gather in the harvest all that we\r\nfind is merely what they have left. There are even some that have a\r\nqueer-shaped beak for splitting fruit open and dividing it into\r\nquarters so as to get at the pips, which are to them the very choicest\r\nof titbits. Look at this one’s beak and tell me if you have ever seen a\r\nmore singular tool.”\r\n\r\n“The two mandibles cross each other,” said Jules. “Instead of meeting\r\nthey go criss-cross like the blades of an old pair of scissors out of\r\norder.”\r\n\r\n“What can such a rickety beak be good for,” Emile asked, “with its tips\r\npointing one up and the other down? It will never be able to pick up a\r\nseed from the ground.”\r\n\r\n“Consequently, it does not get its food from the ground. Its manner of\r\nproceeding is more complicated.\r\n\r\n“First I will say that the bird is known as a crossbill, from the\r\nposition of the two mandibles. This odd arrangement is not the result\r\nof an accident to the bird, as for instance a sprain following some\r\nviolent effort; it is not a crippled beak, nor is it a rickety beak, as\r\nEmile calls it, but a beak in its natural and perfect state. The bird\r\nis born with this odd beak and has never had any other. It is even\r\nextremely doubtful whether it would consent to make a change if it had\r\nthe opportunity, so useful a tool is this beak for the work it has to\r\ndo. The crossbill has a fondness for pine seeds above all other food.\r\nTake a pine-cone and lift the scales with the point of a penknife. You\r\nwill find behind each scale two seeds full of oil and smelling slightly\r\nof resin. They are the titbits the bird is after. But how get at them\r\nunder scales so hard and so firmly held in place? In vain would the\r\ngrosbeak hammer at these scales with its strong tool; it would never\r\nsucceed in opening them. Even we ourselves with the aid of a knife find\r\nit difficult. But the crossbill makes play of this hard work. It\r\ninserts the tip of one mandible under the scale and, using the other as\r\na fulcrum, pries with a turning movement until the scale is lifted and\r\nthe seed laid bare; and the whole thing is done in next to no time. A\r\nkey turning in the lock does not push the bolt more easily.”\r\n\r\n“I must change my mind,” Jules acknowledged, “about this beak that at\r\nfirst seemed to me so awkward; it is a first-rate key to force the lock\r\nof a pine-cone.”\r\n\r\n“And it is not less useful,” proceeded his uncle, “in quartering apples\r\nand getting out the pips. I should not like to have crossbills by the\r\ndozen in any orchard of mine; they would soon tear all the fruit to\r\npieces. Fortunately, it is not our level plains that these birds choose\r\nas their haunts, but cold, mountainous regions covered with dark\r\nforests of cone-bearing evergreens. Their plumage is bright red more or\r\nless tinged with green and yellow. Crossbills breed in the coldest\r\ncountries of Europe and build their nests even in midwinter. Their\r\nmaterials are moss and lichens, made to shed the melting snow by a\r\ncoating of resin.\r\n\r\n“I shall enter no plea for the crossbill: its taste for apple and pear\r\nseeds is a serious matter; but I will mention certain things that seem\r\nto plead for the granivorous birds as a class. First, the greater\r\nnumber of these birds feed on wild seeds of no value to us even if not\r\nactually harmful to our cultivated fields. We weed our tilled land,\r\nclearing it of all plants that exhaust it to no purpose. Many\r\ngranivorous birds also weed, in their own way: they gather the seeds\r\nthat would otherwise infest the soil. For example, must we not\r\nacknowledge the services of the goldfinch, which, when thistles have\r\nmatured, alights on their prickly heads and searches for the seeds amid\r\nthe thistle-down? I need not describe this pretty little bird, so well\r\nis it known to you all.”\r\n\r\n“It has a splash of red on its head,” said Emile, “with yellow, black,\r\nand white on its wings.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is the goldfinch. Its nest, which is one of the most\r\ncarefully built to be found anywhere, is placed in the fork of some\r\nflexible branch. The outside consists of mosses and lichens with a\r\npadding of down from thistles and other plants bearing seeds that have\r\nsilky tufts, as for example the groundsel and the dandelion. The\r\ninside, artistically rounded, is lined with a thick layer of horsehair,\r\nwool, and feathers. The eggs, five or six in number, are white with\r\nreddish-brown spots, chiefly at the large end. The goldfinch merits our\r\ngratitude: it cheers us with its singing and works diligently at\r\nweeding lands infested with thistles and groundsel.\r\n\r\n“I will say as much in favor of the linnet, which feeds on all kinds of\r\nsmall seeds in our fields and to that extent follows the honorable\r\ntrade of weeding. At the same time I will not hide its liking for\r\nlinseed, which has given it the name it bears. It is very fond of\r\nhemp-seed, also. But hemp and flax are not found everywhere, and the\r\nbird manages to get along very well without them by gathering a\r\nquantity of other seeds, more or less harmful to agriculture. It likes\r\nto breed in hilly country, choosing some thickly grown juniper-tree or\r\nbush. Its nest contains five or six white eggs with red spots. Its\r\nplumage is brown with a dash of crimson on head and breast.\r\n\r\n“To the part of weeders, seed-eating birds add a second even more\r\npraiseworthy one. Seeds, it is true, furnish their customary food; but\r\nmost of the birds devour a great number of insects when these are\r\nplentiful and easy to find. If they lack the patience to hunt for worms\r\nin their most hidden retreats with the painstaking care of the\r\nslender-beaks, they at least profit by those that fortune places within\r\ntheir reach. A few grubs to season their regular diet of seeds are a\r\ngodsend to them; and, moreover, their favorite seeds may by some\r\nmischance be lacking in their neighborhood. Not every day can the\r\ngoldfinch find thistle-seeds nor the linnet flaxseed. What, then, is to\r\nbe done except to have patience and in the meantime eat insects?\r\n\r\n“Last but not least, in their young days when, weak and featherless,\r\nthey are fed from the parents’ beak, many granivorous birds are brought\r\nup on insects. The reason is plain enough. You can readily understand\r\nthat the delicate crop of a young bird just out of the shell has not\r\nthe strength to digest hard, dry seeds. It must have something more\r\nnourishing, something smaller and, above all, more succulent, such as a\r\nmarmalade of grubs prepared in the mother’s beak. A few days later,\r\nwith the first growth of down, will come little soft caterpillars\r\nserved whole; then tougher insects will prepare the stomach for the\r\nmore difficult digestion of seeds. I select a few examples at random.\r\n\r\n“The chaffinch, the gay chaffinch, is well known to be a granivorous\r\nbird, a lover of millet and hemp-seed. Now, what does it give its\r\nlittle ones while they are still in the nest? It gives them hairless\r\ncaterpillars and tender larvæ, chosen as being the easiest food to\r\ndigest. I can say the same of the greenfinch, a bird with plumage\r\nmidway between green and yellow; of the bullfinch, known by its red\r\nbreast and stomach; and of the various buntings that come in the winter\r\nin flocks, pecking around our straw-stacks. These last, however, feed\r\nperhaps more than the others on seeds, as they have on the inside of\r\nthe upper mandible a small, hard excrescence intended expressly for\r\ncrushing them.\r\n\r\n“I might add to these examples, but prefer to conclude with a bird that\r\nis one of the most familiar to you, the sparrow. Here, certainly, we\r\nhave an undoubted seed-eater. It raids our dove-cotes and poultry-yards\r\nand steals the food of our pigeons and poultry. It goes a-harvesting in\r\nthe grain-fields before our reapers have begun their task. A great many\r\nother misdeeds are laid at its door. It strips cherry-trees, plunders\r\nour gardens, forages for sprouting seeds, regales itself on young\r\nlettuce, and nips the first little leaflets of green peas. But when\r\nhatching-time comes this bold pilferer is transformed into a helper\r\ninferior to none. At least twenty times an hour the father and the\r\nmother, by turns, bring a mouthful to their young ones, and each time\r\nit consists of either a caterpillar or an insect large enough to\r\nrequire quartering, or perhaps a larva as fat as butter; or it may be a\r\ngrasshopper or some other small game. In one week the brood consumes\r\nabout three thousand insects, including larvæ, caterpillars, and grubs\r\nof all kinds. I have counted in the immediate vicinity of a single nest\r\nof these birds the remains of seven hundred June-bugs besides small\r\ninsects without number. Behold what a store of food is needed for\r\nraising only one brood! What quantities of vermin, then, must all the\r\nbroods of a community devour! After such services let him who will\r\npresume to raise a hand against our sparrows; as for me, I leave them\r\nin peace as long as they do not become too troublesome.\r\n\r\n“My closing word is this: eaters of seeds and eaters of insects,\r\ngrosbeaks and slender-beaks, some in greater degree, some in less, all\r\ncome to our aid. Peace, then, to the little birds, the joy of the\r\ncountry-side and the protectors of our crops!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nSNAKES AND LIZARDS\r\n\r\n\r\n“I propose to-day to undertake the defense of reptiles, which many\r\npeople fear and dislike, even look upon with horror. I have shown you\r\nwhat services are rendered by bats despite the repugnance we feel for\r\nthem. These animals, regarded by us as hideous and treated as enemies,\r\nI have brought you to look upon as valuable helpers, veritable swallows\r\nof the night, devoted to the extermination of twilight insects. As soon\r\nas reason illuminates the darkness of prejudice the detested creature\r\nis found to be a very useful animal. In like manner I shall now try to\r\nmake you separate the false from the true in respect to the reptiles.\r\nLet us begin with the snake.\r\n\r\n“If to explain our dislike for bats we mention their strange and\r\nrepulsive appearance, we have not the same excuse in regard to snakes.\r\nTheir slender form is not lacking in grace, the suppleness they display\r\nin their undulating movements is pleasing to the eye, and their scaly\r\nskin is decorated with well-defined colors that are prettily arranged.\r\nOur aversion, then, must be otherwise explained. Some serpents are\r\nvenomous; they are armed with a formidable and death-dealing weapon.\r\nCertainly it is not for these that I ask your favor. Indeed, if it were\r\nin my power to exterminate them all I would gladly free the earth of\r\ntheir presence. But others—and these are far more numerous—are not\r\nvenomous and consequently are perfectly harmless unless they are large\r\nenough to hurt us by muscular force, which is not rare in the hot\r\ncountries of the equator, but never to be feared in our part of the\r\nworld, where the largest snake is not so strong as a mere child. Thus\r\nit is that some are much to be feared on account of their venom, while\r\nothers, at least those of this region, are not in the least dangerous.\r\nBut we are all too prone to lose sight of this difference in serpents.\r\nThe evil reputation of the one with venomous fangs is fastened on all\r\nthe others, so that we abhor them all alike because we believe them all\r\nto be venomous. In France we have only one venomous serpent, the viper,\r\nand all the others, large as well as small, are perfectly harmless and\r\nwe will refer to them simply as snakes.\r\n\r\n“In one of our former talks [7] I told you about the viper, describing\r\nits form and coloring, the structure of its venomous apparatus, and the\r\neffects of its bite. I here repeat the principal facts then related, in\r\norder to give you now a connected account of our serpents as a class.\r\n\r\n“All serpents dart back and forth between their lips, with extreme\r\nrapidity, something that looks like a black thread, of great\r\nflexibility and ending in a fork. Many persons believe this to be the\r\nreptile’s weapon, the sting, as they call it, whereas in reality it is\r\nnothing but the tongue—a quite inoffensive tongue, which the creature\r\nuses for catching insects to feed upon, and also for expressing in its\r\nown peculiar fashion the passions that agitate it. This last it does by\r\nshooting the tongue swiftly in and out between the lips. All serpents\r\nwithout exception have a tongue, but in our country it is only the\r\nviper that possesses the terrible apparatus for injecting venom.\r\n\r\n“This apparatus is composed, first, of two fangs or long, sharp teeth,\r\nsituated in the upper jaw. Unlike ordinary teeth, these fangs are not\r\nfixed firmly in their sockets, but can at the creature’s will stand up\r\nfor attack or lie down in a groove of the gum and remain there as\r\nharmless as a stiletto in its sheath. In this way the viper runs no\r\nrisk of wounding itself. The fangs are hollow and pierced near the\r\npoint with a very small opening through which the venom is discharged\r\ninto the wound they give. Finally, at the base of each fang is a small\r\npocket or sac filled with a venomous liquid. It is to all appearance a\r\nperfectly harmless liquid, odorless and tasteless, so that you would\r\ntake it for nothing but water. When the viper strikes with its fangs,\r\nthe venom sac discharges a drop of its contents into the tiny channel\r\nperforating the fang, and the liquid is injected into the wound. It is\r\nby mixing with the blood that the venom produces its terrifying\r\neffects.”\r\n\r\n“I remember all that very well,” said Jules, “and also what you said\r\nmust be done to prevent the mixing of the venom with the blood in\r\ngeneral that circulates through the body.”\r\n\r\n“And I also told you that the viper haunts by preference warm, rocky\r\nhills; it lurks under stones and in underbrush. In color it is brown or\r\nreddish, with a dark zigzag stripe along the back and a row of spots on\r\neach side, each spot fitting into one of the angles made by the zigzag\r\nstripe. Its stomach is slate-color and its head rather triangular in\r\nshape, being broader than the neck and running to a blunt point at the\r\nmouth. The viper is timid by nature and attacks man only in\r\nself-defense. Its movements are abrupt, irregular, and sluggish.”\r\n\r\n“What does it live on?” Jules inquired. “Does it eat nothing but little\r\ninsects that it can catch with its tongue?”\r\n\r\n“Its chief food consists of larger prey, which calls for the use of its\r\nvenomous weapon. Small field-rats, field-mice, meadow-mice, moles,\r\nsometimes frogs and even toads, are its usual victims. The animal\r\nattacked by the reptile is first stung with the venomous fangs,\r\nwhereupon it is immediately overcome with agony. As soon as the prey is\r\ndead the viper twines its folds about the lifeless body, squeezes it\r\ntightly, and subjects it to a sort of kneading process in order to make\r\nit smaller; for the victim must be gulped down in one mouthful even if\r\nit exceeds the serpent itself in size. This preparation finished, the\r\ngullet opens to its utmost width and the two jaws, seeming almost to\r\nfly apart, seize with their sharp teeth, which point backward toward\r\nthe throat, the head of the mole or field-mouse or whatever the small\r\ngame may be. A flow of saliva then streams over the body to make it\r\nslip down more readily, but it is so large a mouthful that the viper\r\nmanages to swallow it only by a violent effort. The throat dilates and\r\ncontracts, the jaws move alternately from right to left and from left\r\nto right, to coax the unwieldy mass downward, and so it is that this\r\nlaborious swallowing is protracted sometimes for hours, sometimes for a\r\nwhole day. Indeed, it not seldom occurs that the forward half of the\r\nprey is already undergoing digestion in the stomach while the hind\r\nquarters still stick in the throat or protrude from the mouth.\r\n\r\n“Let us pass on to the common snakes. These have no venomous fangs in\r\nthe jaw; their teeth are small and even and lacking in strength, useful\r\nas an aid in holding the captured prey and helping in the swallowing of\r\nit (which is as difficult as with the viper), but incapable of\r\ninflicting a serious wound. These creatures, too, are extremely timid,\r\nfleeing at the slightest alarm; but if retreat is cut off they put on a\r\nbold front to impose on the enemy, coiling themselves in a spiral,\r\nerecting the head, swaying this way and that, hissing, and trying to\r\nbite. There is no need, however, to be afraid; a scratch of no more\r\nimportance than a pin-prick would be the worst that could befall one.\r\nYou would suffer far greater injury by thrusting your hand into a\r\nbramble-bush.”\r\n\r\n“If it isn’t any more dangerous than that,” Jules declared boldly, “I\r\nshan’t mind taking up snakes in my hands.”\r\n\r\n“I do not tell you this to encourage you to capture these creatures and\r\nmake playthings of them; on the contrary, I wish you to leave them\r\nalone, but I also desire to remove an unwarranted fear, the fear of\r\nsnakes that is so prevalent in country districts. Fear, always an evil\r\ncounselor, never does a good deed in prompting one to throw stones at a\r\nharmless creature found in a hole in the wall. The passer-by attacks it\r\nwith his stick if he sees it crossing the road, and the mower in the\r\nhay-field cuts off its head with his scythe. Were they not listening to\r\na foolish fear and yielding to an unreasonable dislike, they would\r\nleave the poor thing in peace and no one would be the worse for it, as\r\nsnakes not only are harmless, but they render us excellent service by\r\ndestroying numerous insects and small rodents such as meadow-mice and\r\nfield-mice. From this point of view, snakes deserve protection and not\r\nthe hatred that is commonly felt for them.”\r\n\r\n“But,” objected Louis, “they say snakes can charm birds by their gaze\r\nand draw them into their open mouth by first overcoming them with their\r\npoisonous breath. Helpless, the bird plunges headlong into the\r\ncreature’s horrible gullet.”\r\n\r\n“There is a grain of truth in what you say, but far more untruth, the\r\nresult of popular superstition which deliberately credits the serpent\r\nwith sorcery. In the first place, the breath of a serpent, or of any\r\nreptile whatever, has nothing poisonous about it, nothing magically\r\nattractive, nothing supernatural. You all have too much common sense to\r\nmake it necessary for me to dwell on these ridiculous tales. There\r\nremains only the belief that the bird is charmed by the reptile’s hard,\r\nfixed gaze. The marvel of this amounts in reality to very little.\r\n\r\n“Some of our snakes are very fond of birds’ eggs. They climb trees,\r\nsearch out the nests, and eat the eggs when the mothers are not there\r\nto protect them. More than one human nest-robber who thought he was\r\nseizing a jay’s or a blackbird’s brood has put his hand instead on the\r\ncold coiled body of a reptile in the bottom of the nest. I have even\r\nknown instances in which the plunderers, seized with horror at this\r\nunexpected encounter, fell backward from the tree-top and did not come\r\nout of the adventure without broken bones. A warning to others. The\r\nlarger snakes do not content themselves with eggs, but devour the young\r\nbirds as well, even those that are outside the nest when they can catch\r\nthem, which fortunately is not easy. Imagine an innocent little bird\r\nsurprised by a snake in the underbrush. The poor little thing suddenly\r\nsees before it a mouth horribly wide open and glittering eyes regarding\r\nit steadily. Scared almost to death, the bird loses its head and is\r\npowerless to take flight. In vain it beats its wings, cries\r\nplaintively, and finally falls from the branch, paralyzed and dying.\r\nThe monster lying in wait catches the poor thing in its mouth.\r\n\r\n“The power to charm that serpents are supposed to have is therefore in\r\nreality only the power so to terrify a bird that it cannot fly. We\r\nourselves, on being suddenly confronted by an appalling danger—do we\r\nalways retain the presence of mind necessary to face it? Are there not\r\nplenty of persons that get bewildered, lose their wits completely, and\r\nmake matters worse by acting foolishly? The charm exerted by serpents\r\nall comes down simply to that. I am inclined to believe that a bird, on\r\nbeing surprised by a snake, usually is able to overcome the first\r\nfeeling of terror and to take flight as soon as it sees the reptile’s\r\nhorrible gullet yawning to receive the expected prey; and so the\r\nserpent’s attempt to paralyze its victim has a chance to succeed only\r\nwith very young and inexperienced birds. What paralyzes with fright an\r\nignorant young nestling hardly affects a bird that is master of itself;\r\nwhat terrifies a child or a person of weak character makes little\r\nimpression on a man capable of keeping his head in time of danger.\r\nAcquire the habit, children, of keeping calm in times of danger or\r\nexcitement, and you will avoid many calamities and escape many perils,\r\njust as the bird that does not lose its head escapes the snake lurking\r\nin ambush to catch it.\r\n\r\n“One of our common snakes is the water-snake, so called because it\r\nlikes damp places and frequents still water, where it shows itself a\r\ngood swimmer in its pursuit of little fish, water insects, and\r\ntadpoles. It lays its eggs usually in dunghills, where they will be\r\nhatched out by the heat. These eggs are of an elongated oval shape,\r\nwith a soft shell resembling wet parchment. In size they are about as\r\nlarge as a magpie’s eggs. They are joined together in a string by a\r\nsemi-liquid viscous substance. On stirring a heap of dung, country\r\npeople often turn up with their forks these soft-shelled eggs whose\r\norigin is unknown to them and from which, to their great surprise, come\r\nyoung serpents. They declare them to be roosters’ eggs, unnatural eggs,\r\nmagic eggs that produce snakes instead of chickens; and it would be\r\ndifficult to convince them that this is not true. As for you, my\r\nchildren, if you ever happen to hear any one speak of eggs laid by\r\nroosters in dunghills and producing serpents, remember that they are\r\nsimply the eggs of the water-snake.\r\n\r\n“Put no faith, either, in still another fable current in our villages.\r\nAccording to this, all snakes have a consuming desire to enter the\r\nmouth and then the body of any one sleeping on the cool grass. To rid\r\nthe patient of this inconvenient guest the serpent must be lured from\r\nits retreat by the smell of warm milk. Of course this is pure nonsense,\r\nas no animal can wish to take refuge in the human stomach, where it\r\nwould be digested, reduced to pap, by the same process that digests our\r\nbread.\r\n\r\n“One often meets in hay-fields or even in hay itself a small reptile\r\ndiffering from the snake in structure. It is known as the slow-worm or\r\nblind-worm. Its head is small and merges into the body without\r\nnarrowing into a neck; furthermore, the tail is blunt, so that the two\r\nends of the body are of nearly the same shape and leave us for a moment\r\nin doubt as to which is the head and which the tail. The slow-worm is\r\ncovered with very smooth and shiny scales. The back is silvery yellow\r\nand marked from one end to the other by three black lines which change,\r\nas the worm grows older, to a succession of dots and even disappear\r\nentirely at last. The stomach is blackish. On being disturbed the\r\nslow-worm forcibly contracts, stiffens, and becomes almost as rigid as\r\na lizard’s tail.\r\n\r\n“Many people believe that this little creature is venomous, and even to\r\ntouch it or meet its eye is thought to be very dangerous. But its evil\r\nreputation is quite undeserved. The slow-worm is really the most\r\nharmless of reptiles: it does not even offer to bite in its own\r\ndefense, but contents itself with stiffening until it is as rigid as a\r\nwooden rod. It lives chiefly on beetles and earthworms.\r\n\r\n“Now to conclude this brief account of snakes: vipers excepted, not one\r\nof our serpents is venomous, none can harm us, the bite of none is in\r\nthe least dangerous. Snakes do us no injury whatever; on the contrary,\r\nthey help us by destroying a multitude of insects and small rodents.\r\nLet us, then, conquer an unreasonable horror and hatred and suffer\r\nthese helpers of ours to live in peace.\r\n\r\n“Equal consideration should be shown to lizards, those agile hunters of\r\ninsects and even of small fur-bearing game such as rodents. Who does\r\nnot know the little gray lizard, lover of sunny walls? It lies in wait\r\nfor flies, darting its tongue in and out as if in play; and it ransacks\r\none hole after another in quest of insects. It is the protector of\r\nwall-fruit.\r\n\r\n“When on a fine spring day the sun shines warm on some wall or\r\nhillside, the lizard may be seen stretched out comfortably on this wall\r\nor on the new grass covering the hillside. It steeps itself delightedly\r\nin the healthful warmth; it shows its pleasure by gentle undulations of\r\nits relaxed tail and by its shining eyes; and presently, perhaps, it\r\ndarts like an arrow to seize some small prey or to find a spot still\r\nmore to its liking. Far from fleeing at the approach of man, it seems\r\nto regard him with friendliness; but at the slightest alarming sound,\r\nas the fall of a leaf, it rolls over, falls, and remains motionless for\r\nsome moments, as if stunned by the fall; or else it darts away,\r\nvanishes from sight, reappears, hides again, then comes forth once\r\nmore, turns and twists until the eye can hardly follow it, folds itself\r\nover several times, and finally retires to some shelter to recover from\r\nits fright.\r\n\r\n“As useful as it is graceful in form, the little gray lizard lives on\r\nflies, crickets, grasshoppers, earthworms, and nearly all insects that\r\nprey upon our fruit and grain; thus it would be much to our advantage\r\nif the species were more widely scattered. The greater our supply of\r\ngray lizards, the faster should we see the enemies of our gardens\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\n“The green lizard so common everywhere—in hedges, on the skirts of\r\nwoods, in thickets having an undergrowth of wild grass—attains a length\r\nof three decimeters. The back shows an elegant embroidery of green\r\npearls set off with black and yellow dots. This little creature is\r\nmarvelously swift of foot, darting into the midst of underbrush and dry\r\nleaves with a suddenness that always takes one by surprise and causes\r\nat first a little start of fear. When it is attacked by a dog it throws\r\nitself at the assailant’s snout and plants its teeth with such\r\ndetermination that it will let itself be carried along and even killed\r\nrather than relax its hold. But its bite is not at all venomous; it\r\nmerely punctures the skin without leaving in the wound any kind of\r\npoison. In captivity it becomes very tame, very gentle, and willingly\r\nlets itself be handled. Its food consists chiefly of insects.\r\n\r\n“The olive-growing districts of France have another lizard, larger,\r\nstronger, heavier, and more squat in form than the common green lizard.\r\nThe people of Provence call it the glass-bead, but scientists give it\r\nthe name of ocellated lizard from the small black spots scattered like\r\nlittle eyes (ocelli, in Latin) on the bluish-green background of the\r\ncreature’s back. This lizard haunts dry hillsides exposed to the full\r\nheat of the sun. It bores for itself a deep hole in some sandy spot,\r\ngenerally under the shelter of a projecting stone. Trusting to its\r\nformidable bite, it is very bold. Not only does it leap at dogs’\r\nsnouts, but it will even attack man if it finds itself too\r\nhard-pressed. This courage has won for it a terrible reputation among\r\ncountry people, who think it very dangerous, more venomous than even\r\nthe viper.\r\n\r\n“Now, Uncle Paul, who knows this lizard as well as he knows the bottom\r\nof his own pocket, who has watched its movements for whole days in\r\norder to learn its habits, who has examined its teeth very carefully so\r\nas to be able to report with authority on its bite, and who has even\r\nlet himself be bitten by it in order to leave no doubt on the\r\nsubject—Uncle Paul, I say, declares that this dreaded lizard does not\r\ndeserve the reputation it bears. It is not venomous in the least; it\r\nbites hard, it is true, nipping the skin and even taking away a piece,\r\nbut without poisoning the wound; in a word, it is no more to be feared\r\nthan the common green lizard. Its food consists of beetles,\r\ngrasshoppers, and small field-rats; and therefore, despite the fear it\r\ninspires, I have no hesitation in placing the ocellated lizard in the\r\nclass of helpers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nTHE BATRACHIANS\r\n\r\n\r\n“I have kept until the last the ugliest and the least esteemed of our\r\nhelpers, the toad. With it must be classed the frog and the tree-toad\r\nbecause of their close resemblance to it in form and, still more,\r\nbecause of the similar change all three undergo in developing from the\r\negg to the full-grown animal. Common language gives the name of\r\nreptile, from a Latin word meaning to creep or crawl, to the snake and\r\nthe toad, the lizard and the frog, and all similar hairless animals\r\nhaving either no legs at all or very short ones and crawling on the\r\nstomach. Science, however, makes a difference; it limits the name\r\nreptile to the snake, the lizard, and other animals having a scaly skin\r\nand hatching from the egg in the form they are to keep; and it gives\r\nthe name batrachian (from the Greek batrachos, a frog) to the toad,\r\nfrog, tree-toad, and some others, which have a naked skin and whose\r\nfirst shape gives place later to a different one. Reptiles do not\r\nundergo a complete change; batrachians do. Just as the butterfly is\r\nfirst a caterpillar, quite different in structure, its way of living,\r\nand its diet from what it finally becomes in its perfect state, so the\r\ntoad, the frog, and the tree-toad begin their existence as tadpoles\r\nwith none of the structure and habits they are finally to have.\r\n\r\n“Tadpole or big-head, that is the word to indicate the batrachian in\r\nits transitory state. A very large head merging into a plump stomach\r\nthat ends abruptly in a flat tail—such is the animal in the beginning.\r\nIt has no limbs, no organs of locomotion unless it be the tail, which\r\nwhips the water to push the creature forward and serves as oar and\r\nrudder at the same time. The toad tadpole is small and entirely black;\r\nthe frog tadpole is much larger, silvery on the belly and grayish on\r\nthe back. All tadpoles inhabit still waters, as ponds or pools warmed\r\nby the sun; but for toad tadpoles even shallow puddles or wagon-ruts\r\nwith a few inches of rain will suffice, where they can gather in black\r\nrows or stretch themselves flat on the stomach in the tepid mud at the\r\nwater’s edge. Frog tadpoles, however, thrive best in ponds of some\r\nextent, with various water-plants and sufficient depth for diving and\r\nswimming. Like fish, tadpoles breathe the air that is in water; and\r\nlike them, also, they die if kept out of water a short time. Thus they\r\nare real fish as far as breathing is concerned. But in their final form\r\nbatrachians breathe atmospheric air and die of suffocation in water.\r\nThey are land animals in that state, and breathe like other land\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n“You have very often seen frogs and toads in the water, and no doubt\r\nyou think they could live there indefinitely. Undeceive yourselves:\r\nthey go to the water only to lay their eggs or to escape from some\r\ndanger or to bathe in hot weather, but they could not remain under\r\nwater any length of time without dying. They have to come up at\r\nintervals to breathe, which they do by getting at least the nostrils\r\nout. Here we have a difference between the tadpole and the full-grown\r\nbatrachian, between the larva, so to speak, and the creature at its\r\nmaturity: the tadpole lives in water and perishes in the air, whereas\r\nthe frog that comes from it lives in the air and perishes in water.\r\n\r\n“And there is a still further difference: the tadpole lives exclusively\r\non vegetable matter, its mouth is equipped with a sort of small horny\r\nbeak to browse the foliage of water-plants, and in its big belly it has\r\na very long intestine coiled about several times so as to prolong the\r\npassage of the food through the body and thus make sure that all the\r\njuices it may contain are extracted. The mature batrachian exchanges\r\nthis horny beak for real jaws furnished with irregularities that serve\r\nas teeth, it lives solely on an animal diet, especially on insects, and\r\nits intestine is short because the food it eats is easy of digestion\r\nand readily yields what nourishment it contains.\r\n\r\n“To turn a tadpole into a frog or a toad it is not enough to change its\r\nrespiratory and digestive organs; new organs form, organs of which\r\nthere was not the least sign when the creature was hatched, while still\r\nothers disappear without leaving any trace. The tadpole is born\r\nabsolutely without legs. After a while the hind legs appear, later come\r\nthe fore legs, and still later the tail shrinks and vanishes.”\r\n\r\n“I remember seeing tadpoles,” said Jules, “some with two legs, some\r\nwith four; but every one of them had a tail.”\r\n\r\n“When the tail has disappeared the animal is no longer a tadpole, but a\r\nyoung toad or frog.”\r\n\r\n“Does the tail come off itself, or does the animal pull it off?” Emile\r\ninquired with eager interest.\r\n\r\n“Neither the one nor the other. The tail is too valuable when the\r\nchange takes place to be thrown away in that reckless fashion. It\r\ncontains a store of material suitable for making something else in the\r\nbodily organism. When the legs begin to put forth, when the organs of\r\ndigestion and those of respiration begin to take a new form, these new\r\ncreations, these transformations, require material with which to build.\r\nFleshy substance is needed for the up-building of the body just as\r\nbricks and mortar are needed for the construction of the house. Of\r\ncourse the tadpole eats to make flesh and to provide a reserve for the\r\nwork of transformation; but this method of accumulation is slow, and\r\ntherefore, to save time, the organs useless to the future animal are\r\ndestroyed, bit by bit, and their material is used in the construction\r\nof new parts. It is thus that the tail disappears. The blood\r\ncirculating through it gradually eats it away, dissolves it, as we\r\nmight say, at the proper time and carries elsewhere the fluid\r\nsubstance, which, turned again into flesh, helps to form the legs or\r\nother parts of the remodeled organism.”\r\n\r\n“What a deal of economy in getting rid of a tadpole’s tail!” exclaimed\r\nEmile. “Not a particle of it, even if no bigger than a pin’s head, must\r\nbe thrown away, for it might be used to make the little toe on one of\r\nthe feet.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my boy, a wonderful economy, an economy careful of every atom of\r\nmatter in order that life, the divine worker, may not fail to have at\r\nits disposal, undiminished by waste, the resources committed to its\r\nkeeping by the Creator for works that are unceasingly being destroyed\r\nand then restored on a new plan.\r\n\r\n“I should add here that certain batrachians keep the tail as long as\r\nthey live. To this class belong the salamanders, one species of which,\r\nthe terrestrial or land salamander, is extremely ugly. In form it is\r\nhalf-way between a toad and a lizard, and its color is black with large\r\nbright-yellow spots. It is from one to two decimeters long. It haunts\r\ndamp places near springs and eats insects and earthworms. Despite its\r\nrepulsive appearance it is perfectly harmless.\r\n\r\n“The tadpole of the salamander breathes through fine tuft-like\r\nappendages which spread out in the water on each side of the neck.\r\nThese tufts are called gills, and they correspond to the fish’s\r\nbreathing organs or gills, which are likewise situated on each side of\r\nthe neck under the tiny flap commonly called the ear. Tadpoles of the\r\nfrog and the toad have, for the first few days, fringed gills floating\r\nout freely; but in a short time they are drawn in under the skin and\r\nbecome invisible like the gills of fish.\r\n\r\n“Frogs have a slender form not devoid of a certain grace. Their hind\r\nlegs are very long and powerful, being especially good at jumping, the\r\nfrog’s customary mode of progress. First gathering itself together, the\r\nanimal suddenly relaxes like a spring and throws itself forward by a\r\nvigorous thrust of the thighs. The hind toes are very markedly webbed;\r\nin other words, they are united by a membrane as are the toes of\r\nswimming birds, the duck in particular. This arrangement of the toes so\r\nas to form a broad paddle or oar, together with the suppleness of the\r\nhind legs, which are alternately drawn up against the sides and then\r\nforcibly extended, makes the frog an expert swimmer.\r\n\r\n“The common or green frog is spotted with black on a green background,\r\nand it has three yellowish stripes on the back, the belly also being\r\nyellow. It abounds on the banks of all still waters, and to it we owe\r\nthe noisy croaking that comes from every ditch on a summer evening.\r\n\r\n“The red frog is spotted with black on a reddish background, and is\r\neasily recognizable by the black stripe running from the eye over the\r\near. It likes cool places such as damp meadows and fields and\r\nunderbrush. It is less fond of the water than the one just named, and\r\nit croaks much less.\r\n\r\n“Both live on live prey, as for example aquatic larvæ, worms, flies and\r\nother insects, and snails, and they never touch vegetable matter;\r\ntherefore they are good helpers in our gardens.\r\n\r\n“Tree-toads—or, less correctly, tree-frogs—differ from ordinary frogs\r\nin having viscous cushions at the end of their toes, which enable them\r\nto climb trees, where they hunt insects. They stay all summer in the\r\nfoliage and go to the water only to lay their eggs. Their cry, which\r\ngains force from a sort of pocket that shows plainly under the throat,\r\nis very loud and raucous. The tree-toad that we have around here, the\r\ncommon tree-toad, is of a beautiful delicate green hue on the back and\r\nyellowish-white on the belly.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nTHE TOAD\r\n\r\n\r\n“What shall I say in defense of that poor creature, the toad, whose\r\nvery name is enough to excite disgust? It is really loathed by all. It\r\nseems to us the ugliest and most disgusting of animals. What has it\r\ndone, poor thing, to deserve the dislike every one feels for it?\r\n\r\n“It is ugly, the plaintiff asserts. Its flabby form is a shapeless\r\nlump, thrown together as if in careless haste, and its flattened,\r\ndirt-colored back is strewn with livid warts. Its legs, too short for\r\nsymmetry or for effectual service, are unable to lift out of the mud\r\nits swollen stomach, which drags on the ground. Its big head merges\r\ninto a hideous mouth, and heavy eyelids open to show large and\r\nprominent eyes which stare stupidly. If some danger threatens, it puffs\r\nitself up, forming under its skin an air-cushion which resists blows\r\nwith its flabby elasticity.\r\n\r\n“It is venomous, the plaintiff further declares. Squatting in the mire\r\nat the bottom of some dark hole, it absorbs the unwholesome humors of\r\nthe slime for use in filling the warts on its back with a milky venom\r\nwhich oozes out and moistens the entire body in time of peril. It also\r\nsquirts into the eyes of any one who attacks it a liquid, its urine,\r\nwhich burns and stings. It infects the atmosphere with its foul breath.\r\nFrom its gullet drips a fluid that poisons the grass and fruit over\r\nwhich the animal passes, so that its track is as fatal as its\r\nappearance is loathsome. In a word, the toad is ugly and venomous; then\r\nwar without mercy on the hideous creature that infects earth, air,\r\nwater, and by its very appearance disgusts the beholder! There you have\r\nthe charges against the toad.\r\n\r\n“Now what shall I say in my turn, in defense of the poor creature? I\r\nshall tell the truth, the simple truth, and the charges made against it\r\nwill be reduced to nothing.\r\n\r\n“As to the ugliness of the toad I will not say a word; all are welcome\r\nto their own opinion on that subject. I only ask you to recall our talk\r\nabout bats.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think the toad so horribly ugly,” Jules ventured to assert.\r\n“Its golden-yellow eyes are full of fire, its voice is sweet, almost\r\nflute-like, while the frog’s croak is anything but musical. I admit\r\nthat the toad’s bloated body is not graceful; but, after all, it has\r\nsome good points.”\r\n\r\n“Little toads hopping about among the reeds at the edge of the pond,”\r\nsaid Emile, “are pretty to look at, and they make me laugh when they\r\ntumble heels over head every time they jump. I have taken them up in my\r\nhand, but I wouldn’t touch big toads; I am afraid of them.”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t either,” Jules agreed, “for fear of their venom.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, the venom! That is the serious side of the question, and not the\r\ncreature’s ugliness, which is open to discussion. The toad has the\r\nbeauty appropriate to it, the beauty of a toad, and it cannot have any\r\nother without ceasing to be what it is.\r\n\r\n“On being molested toads perspire through the warts that cover their\r\nskin a thick and viscous fluid that looks somewhat like milk. This\r\nsecretion has a nauseous, burning taste and is unbearably bitter.”\r\n\r\n“Some one, then, has tasted the milky sweat that oozes from the toad’s\r\nwarts?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“Yes, scientists have tasted it in order to tell us the truth about it,\r\njust as others have done with the viper’s venom. We must respect highly\r\nthese courageous investigators, who are willing to make any sacrifice\r\nif only they may add to our knowledge and relieve our sufferings.”\r\n\r\n“The toad sweats this milky liquid when tormented; is that the way it\r\ndefends itself?” Jules further inquired.\r\n\r\n“It hopes to defend itself by the horrid odor of its sweat and by its\r\nintolerably bitter taste; but this sweat is put to no further use. The\r\nanimal would be truly dangerous if it could inject its sweat into our\r\nblood as the viper injects its venom through its fangs into the wound\r\nalready made by them. I will now relate a few experiments made by the\r\nscientists I just referred to.\r\n\r\n“A drop of the toad’s milky fluid is introduced with a pointed steel\r\ninstrument into the flesh of a little bird. In a few minutes the bird\r\nstaggers as if intoxicated, shuts its eyes, gasps, and falls dead.”\r\n\r\n“Really and truly dead?” asked Emile.\r\n\r\n“Really and truly dead,” his uncle replied. “A dog is treated in the\r\nsame manner, but with a stronger dose. In less than an hour the animal\r\ndies in a frightful frenzy.”\r\n\r\n“Then this white sweat of the toad must be a perfectly horrible venom,”\r\nJules remarked.\r\n\r\n“Travelers tell us that certain South American Indian tribes poison the\r\ntips of their arrows with this venom. First they impale alive on a long\r\nstick a number of these animals, and then put them near the fire to\r\nmake their warts sweat. The fluid that oozes out is collected in a\r\nlarge leaf, and into this fluid the savages dip their arrow-heads, a\r\nwound from which is then likely to prove fatal.”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t it the truth, then,” asked Jules, “that toads are venomous?”\r\n\r\n“Yes and no. Applied in any way but by injection, the toad’s sweat is\r\nharmless; to act as venom it must mix with the blood through a wound.\r\nBut I will not repeat what I have already told you about the viper’s\r\nvenom. The toad is powerless to make the slightest wound in our flesh,\r\nand therefore it is absolutely impossible for it to harm us. It\r\npossesses a poison without being able to make any use of it except to\r\nbedew its own body by perspiring, thus repelling its enemies by the\r\nhorrid smell and taste of this sweat. You can handle a toad without any\r\nsort of risk if you wish to; wash your hands immediately afterward if\r\nthey have become moistened by the contact, and there will be no further\r\ntrouble. Unless the foolish fancy should seize you to collect a little\r\nof the venomous liquid on the point of a penknife and then prick\r\nyourself with the knife till you drew blood, I can assure you\r\npositively that the toad would cause you no injury whatever.”\r\n\r\n“That is plain enough,” Jules admitted, “for the toad has no means of\r\nmaking a wound to receive the venom from its warts; but they tell of\r\nother kinds of venom such as urine thrown to a distance and drivel\r\nrunning from the mouth.”\r\n\r\n“No drivel runs from the toad’s mouth, nor is there any truth in the\r\nanimal’s poisoning fruit and grass with its saliva. That is pure\r\ncalumny invented to blacken the detested animal.”\r\n\r\n“And the urine?”\r\n\r\n“The toad, when molested, discharges its urine as a means of defense,\r\nbut not to any distance. You would have to hold your face close to the\r\nanimal to receive the discharge in the eyes. If that should happen to\r\nsome careless person, a temporary redness of the eyes would be the\r\nutmost result. But no one would think of putting his face so close to\r\nthe animal, and so there is no cause for alarm on that score.”\r\n\r\n“What about the creature’s terrible breath?” was Jules’s next inquiry.\r\n\r\n“Another calumny on a par with that about the saliva. Its breath is no\r\nmore harmful than any other animal’s. So there is absolutely nothing\r\nleft of the charges brought against the toad. The poison it sweats in\r\nmoments of danger to drive away its enemies cannot injure as venom\r\ninjures, because the animal has no means of injecting it into a wound\r\nand mixing it with the blood, as venom must be mixed to take effect.\r\nThe discharge of its urine falls too short to be dangerous, and even if\r\nit should reach its mark its effect would be so slight that it is not\r\nworth considering. Does any one give a thought to the hedgehog’s urine\r\nwhen that animal sprays itself with this liquid on being molested? The\r\ntoad’s similar mode of defense is no more to be feared. The other\r\ncomplaints, such as the swelling of one’s hands after touching the\r\nanimal, air poisoned by its breath, fruit and vegetables infected by\r\nthe saliva and the creature’s tracks, all come from people’s prejudice,\r\ntheir imagination, which has given the poor batrachian a bad\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\n“The toad is harmless, but that is not enough to entitle it to our\r\nconsideration. It is also a very useful helper, a devourer of beetles,\r\nslugs, larvæ—vermin of every description, in short. After spending the\r\nday under a cool stone or in some dark hole, it leaves its retreat at\r\nnightfall to make its rounds, hunching itself along on its big belly.\r\nHere is a slug making such haste as it can toward the lettuce bed,\r\nthere a cricket chirping at the mouth of its hole, and there again a\r\nJune-bug laying its eggs in the ground. Very softly the toad approaches\r\nand in three mouthfuls gobbles them all up with a gurgle of\r\nsatisfaction. Ah, those tasted good! And now for some more.\r\n\r\n“It continues on its way, and by the time it has finished its rounds,\r\nat daybreak, you may imagine what a multitude of worms and other small\r\nprey the glutton has stowed away in its capacious stomach. And yet this\r\nuseful creature is stoned to death because it is ugly! My children,\r\nnever commit any such act of cruelty, at once foolish and harmful; do\r\nnot stone the toad, for you would thereby deprive the fields and\r\ngardens of a vigilant guardian. Let it go its way in peace and it will\r\ndestroy so many insects that you will in the end find it less ugly than\r\nyou had thought.\r\n\r\n“So well known is the toad’s usefulness that in England the animal is\r\nan article of commerce. Toads are bought in the market at so much a\r\nhead, carried home carefully so as not to come to any harm, and then\r\nallowed the freedom of the garden or placed in a hothouse, a crystal\r\npalace, perhaps, where wonderful plants are grown. The toad’s business\r\nis to lie in wait for beetles, slugs, and other destroyers that might\r\nnibble the valuable plants; and it does its duty with zeal. What a\r\nchange of fortune for the maligned creature when it finds itself living\r\nin a warm atmosphere and surrounded by the most splendid flowers\r\nprocured at great expense from all parts of the world and now exhaling\r\nthe most fragrant odors! As a finishing touch to the honor done the\r\npoor thing in its floral palace of glass, there is offered the tribute\r\nof poetry, that flower of the human imagination and invention. Listen\r\nto this.\r\n\r\n“A wretched toad with head split open and one eye gouged out by some\r\ncruel hand was painfully dragging itself along through the mud of a\r\npublic highway, when four small boys chanced to spy it as they were\r\npassing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            “They spied the toad,\r\n    And one and all sent up a gleeful shout:\r\n    ‘Come on, come on, let’s kill the ugly lout!\r\n    But first we’ll have some fun.’ They laughed their fill,\r\n    As boys will laugh, hard-hearted, when they kill.\r\n    They pricked and goaded with a pointed stick,\r\n    Devising each in turn some cruel trick,\r\n    Flushed with their sport, egged on by passers-by,\r\n    While for the martyred toad none gave a sigh.\r\n    Poor ugly thing! But nature made it so;\r\n    For this alone its blood was caused to flow.\r\n    It tried to flee; one foot was severed quite,\r\n    Which gave the heartless band renewed delight.\r\n    Its gouged-out eye hung down; half-blind it sought\r\n    Some sheltering reeds; its efforts came to naught.\r\n    Its mangled form had been, you would have sworn,\r\n    Through some machine, to be so rent and torn.\r\n    And, oh, to think that hearts can be so base\r\n    As to wish ill to one in such sad case,\r\n    And to so great a load of suffering sore\r\n    To undertake to add one torment more!\r\n    Well-nigh exhausted now, hope almost gone,\r\n    The half-dismembered creature still toiled on.\r\n    E’en death itself would not, for pity’s sake,\r\n    So hideous a thing consent to take;\r\n    Or thus it seemed, and so with antics rude\r\n    The toad’s tormentors still their sport pursued.\r\n    Attempts to snare it next were made in vain:\r\n    It dodged, and sought a rut half filled with rain;\r\n    And, by its muddy bath somewhat restored,\r\n    Withstood the missiles that upon it poured.\r\n    Ah, what a sight was there, the beauty fresh\r\n    Of childhood, and its joy in bleeding flesh!\r\n    Such sport as theirs there surely ne’er had been:\r\n    ‘Come on,’ they called, ‘come John, come Benjamin!\r\n    And bring a stone, a big one, and we’ll see\r\n    If Master Toad is quite as smart as we.’\r\n    Accordingly a massive stone was found,\r\n    Of ponderous weight, unwieldy, large, and round;\r\n    But cheerfully the lads their muscles strained,\r\n    With ends so laudable to be attained.\r\n    Just then, by curious chance, there passed that way\r\n    An over-loaded, heavy-rumbling dray.\r\n    An aged donkey, deaf, half-starved, and lame,\r\n    Was harnessed to the cart—the more’s the shame—\r\n    And on its back a pannier also bore.\r\n    A long day’s march behind and home before,\r\n    The patient beast trudged on with labored breath,\r\n    Though each step more seemed like to be its death.\r\n    Its toil-worn frame was so exceeding thin\r\n    You would have said ‘twas naught but bones and skin.\r\n    It bore full many marks of cruel blows,\r\n    And in its eyes one read the tale of those\r\n    That suffer hardship without hope. Meanwhile\r\n    Its master heaped upon it curses vile,\r\n    Nor spared the cudgel; but the road was deep\r\n    In mire that clogged the wheels, the hills were steep.\r\n    Creaking and groaning in lugubrious tones,\r\n    The dray, thus pulled by thing of skin and bones,\r\n    Moved slowly forward till at length the road\r\n    Descended sharply, and thus eased the load;\r\n    But this now crowded on the nigh-spent beast\r\n    With force sufficient (so it seemed, at least)\r\n    To hurl him headlong. And yet, strange to tell,\r\n    The donkey paused, unheeding blows that fell\r\n    From wrathful hand. The boys broke off their play,\r\n    Content to yield the donkey right of way.\r\n    ‘Stand off!’ they cried; ‘let go there, Dick and Bob;\r\n    Let go the stone, the cart will do our job\r\n    With much more sport for us, so stand aside!’\r\n    All stood alert to see what should betide\r\n    Their wretched victim. But far otherwise\r\n    The thing fell out before their wondering eyes\r\n    Than they had thought: the donkey, bruised and lame,\r\n    At sight of woes that put his own to shame\r\n    Spared not himself, but gathered all his strength\r\n    And held the loaded cart until, at length,\r\n    Although remonstrant blows rained on his back,\r\n    He turned the dray from out the beaten track.\r\n    The grinding wheels, diverted, harmless pass,\r\n    And tortured toad is saved by tortured ass.\r\n    The driver cracks his whip, pulls at the reins,\r\n    And now the dray once more the road regains.\r\n    At that, one of the group engaged in play\r\n    (The very one who tells you this to-day)\r\n    Let fall the stone he’d been about to cast\r\n    Just as the laden wain came rumbling past;\r\n    And as he dropped it, lo, in accents clear\r\n    A mandate from on high fell on his ear,\r\n    A mandate that was quickly understood,\r\n    For it was brief, these simple words: ‘Be good.’ [8]\r\n\r\n\r\n“In closing I repeat, with the great poet: ‘Be good.’ Be good if you\r\nwish God to love you; be good that you may grow up to be noble-hearted\r\nmen; be good to one another, helping one another; be good to the\r\nanimals that give us their fleece, their strength, and their life, and\r\nthose that protect the fruits of the earth for us by keeping vigilant\r\nguard over them. Be kind to them all, even to the humblest among them,\r\nthe toad, which serves us uncomplainingly and asks in return no pay but\r\na pitying glance.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nINSTINCT\r\n\r\n\r\nJules and Emile had put a caterpillar into a glass and brought it to\r\ntheir uncle, who made it the subject of a little talk to his young\r\nhearers.\r\n\r\n“Examine the creature closely,” said he. “Its skin is delicate, so\r\ndelicate that even a light touch hurts it; but here on the head, at the\r\npoint called the skull, it has the hardness of horn, forming a sort of\r\ncap or helmet which can without injury endure friction with the hard\r\ntexture of wood. The head is the part of the creature that opens the\r\nway, and it is therefore protected by armor, while the rest of the\r\nbody, as it follows the head, does not need this casing of horn.”\r\n\r\n“I understand,” said Emile; “the creature works its way along by\r\nscratching and tunneling with its feet.”\r\n\r\n“No, my boy; the feet are not used for boring through wood. The\r\ncaterpillar has eight pairs. The first three pairs, or those nearest\r\nthe head, have quite a different shape from the others: they are\r\nslender and pointed, and it is they that in the change that takes place\r\nlater become the butterfly’s legs, though in doing so they grow much\r\nlonger and take another shape. Hence they are called the true legs. The\r\nnext four pairs are placed toward the middle of the body, and the last\r\npair is at the very end. These five pairs bear the name of false legs\r\nbecause they completely disappear when the caterpillar gives place to\r\nthe butterfly or moth. They are short and wide, and are furnished\r\nbeneath with numerous little hooks by which the caterpillar clings to\r\nthe walls of its abode. The stiff hairs covering the body are also used\r\nfor locomotion, the caterpillar wriggling and squirming in its tunnel\r\nsomewhat as does the chimney-sweep in helping himself with knees and\r\nback as he makes his way up the inside of a chimney.”\r\n\r\n“Then what does the caterpillar use for boring through the wood?” asked\r\nJules.\r\n\r\n“The tool for chipping away the wood consists of two curved fangs or\r\nteeth, almost black, one on each side of the mouth, which open and shut\r\nlike a pair of cutting nippers. They are called mandibles and are in\r\nreality jaws or, more properly, teeth which, instead of meeting in a\r\nvertical plane as do ours, come together horizontally or sidewise. For\r\nprecision of movement these mandibles are superior to our best cutting\r\nnippers, and for hardness they are almost equal to steel. They seize\r\nthe wood, bit by bit, patiently and untiringly; they cut, saw, tear\r\naway a little at a time, and so bore a tunnel just large enough for the\r\ncaterpillar to pass through.”\r\n\r\n“And what becomes of the wood-dust?” Jules further inquired. “I should\r\nthink it would block the way, the passage being so narrow.”\r\n\r\n“The wood-dust passes through the creature’s body; the caterpillar eats\r\nit, and after digestion has taken from it the very small amount of\r\nnourishment it contains, it is ejected behind, molded into tiny\r\npellets. Digestion in a caterpillar is soon accomplished. Just think of\r\nit: wood is an extremely meager fare, and so the worm must keep on\r\neating its way forward, cutting, gnawing, digesting. To acquire the\r\nfatness necessary for the coming change the creature must have a\r\ngood-sized pear-tree limb or lilac trunk to work on.\r\n\r\n“The wormhole dust left behind by the boring worm sometimes betrays the\r\ninsect to its enemies. Whenever you see any of this dust left by\r\ndigestion coming out at some little orifice in the bark of a pear-tree,\r\napple-tree, or other tree, you may know the borer is at work, and the\r\nbranch where he is at work should be cut off immediately, to prevent\r\nmore serious harm. If the caterpillar has not gone too far, a pointed\r\niron wire may be thrust into the opening and an attempt made to kill\r\nthe creature in its hole. But as the passage is very winding, this\r\nmethod is by no means certain of success.”\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t the wire be pushed in through another opening?” queried\r\nJules.\r\n\r\n“But, my boy, you don’t suppose the caterpillar is so simple as to make\r\nwindows here and there in its dwelling and so make it easy for its\r\nfoes, of which it has many besides man, to attack it! If it should take\r\na fancy, let us say, to go out and get a little fresh air some fine\r\nday, a sparrow might spy it and carry it off as a choice titbit for its\r\nbrood under the roof tiles. All these dangers it knows; or, rather, it\r\nguesses them vaguely, for every creature, even to the smallest worm,\r\nknows how to protect itself and preserve its species. Unquestionably it\r\nlacks the reasoning faculty, which belongs only to man; but it none the\r\nless acts as if it reasoned out its own interests with an accuracy that\r\nastounds the thoughtful observer. As a matter of fact, my dear\r\nchildren, Another has already reasoned for it, and that Other is the\r\nuniversal Reason in and by whom all live; it is God, the Father of men,\r\nand also the Father of lilacs and of the caterpillars that gnaw them.\r\nThe creature knows, then, without ever having learned; it is master of\r\nits art without having been taught; and at the very first trial, with\r\nno experience to rely on, it does admirably the thing it was intended\r\nto do. This gift bestowed at birth, this unfailing inspiration that\r\nguides it in its work, is called instinct.\r\n\r\n“In its butterfly state the leopard-moth takes very little food, at the\r\nmost a few drops of honey from the opening flowers. Its proboscis, so\r\nslender and so delicate, is fitted to get this food. Now that it no\r\nlonger has its strong mandibles, how can the moth imagine that wood is\r\neatable? Is it possible that it remembers what it liked as a\r\ncaterpillar? Who can say? Moreover, how can the moth tell what trees\r\nhave wood suitable for the larvæ, when we ourselves must have a certain\r\ndegree of education in order to know the commonest varieties? The moth,\r\nwith no previous education, never mistakes a plane-tree for a\r\npear-tree, a box-tree for a lilac, an oak for an elm. Thus the eggs are\r\nalways laid on the right sort of tree, never on any other. Where man\r\nmight make a mistake, the insect never errs.\r\n\r\n“The young larva comes out of the egg. What does the poor little thing\r\nknow from experience of the hard trade it is to follow? Nothing,\r\nabsolutely nothing. No matter; as soon as it is born it attacks the\r\nwood it rests upon and hollows out a shelter for itself with the least\r\npossible delay. This most urgent business being attended to, it now\r\nleisurely gnaws its way ahead, nibbling a little here and a little\r\nthere and shaping its course according to the quality of the wood. The\r\npassage lengthens, increasing in diameter as the creature grows, and\r\nsometimes ascending, sometimes descending, sometimes running\r\nhorizontally quite through the trunk or branch. The mass of the wood\r\nmay be attacked with little system and without economy, for the larva\r\nis assured of food enough in any event. One precaution, however, it\r\ninvariably takes: it never bores through the bark, for fear of\r\nbetraying its presence to hostile eyes. But how does the larva, working\r\nin total darkness, know when it is getting near the bark and must turn\r\nback? What gives it the fear it has of showing itself? What makes it so\r\ncareful to remain in the heart of the wood and thus avoid the vigilant\r\nsparrow it has never seen? It is instinct, the inspiration that\r\nprotects all animal-kind in the fierce battle of life.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE GRAIN-WEEVIL\r\n\r\n\r\nUncle Paul had sent old Jacques to town to buy the drug they were going\r\nto apply to Simon’s wheat. Meanwhile he took occasion to tell his young\r\nhearers about the wheat-devourer that was to have the benefit of the\r\ndrug. The handful of grain left by Simon was in a plate on the table.\r\nThe little weevils were running about in frantic endeavors to escape,\r\nwhile Emile with a straw was pushing them back into the middle of the\r\nplate, where they cowered among the kernels of wheat. Louis and Jules\r\nwere also there, all attention to what was going on.\r\n\r\n“This ravager of our granaries,” began Uncle Paul, “is called the\r\ngrain-weevil, or, in Latin, calandra. It belongs to the order of\r\ncoleoptera or beetles. Its defensive armor is a hard brown casing\r\nfinely engraved. It has no membranous wings under the elytra or wing\r\nsheaths. Hence it is unable to fly, but it runs fast enough and it\r\nclings to objects with a firm grip. You see how busy Emile is kept with\r\nhis straw in preventing the prisoners’ escape. The grain-weevil is\r\nabout four millimeters long, its body is of a uniform blackish brown,\r\nand its head ends in a long snout, a kind of slender trumpet. The\r\ncorselet or thorax is long, marked with fine pricks or dots, and the\r\nwing sheaths are delicately furrowed. The insect’s most striking\r\ncharacteristic is its long, trumpet-shaped snout.”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” said Jules, “I have seen other beetles, and rather\r\nlarge ones, too, with the head ending in a trumpet like that.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve found them on hazels,” added Louis, “and they had a long, slender\r\nbeak that would make you think the insect was smoking a long pipe.”\r\n\r\n“The trumpet beetles form a numerous class, and they are all weevils,\r\nbut their mode of life varies for the different species. Some attack\r\nfruit-trees and grape-vines. We will speak of them one of these days.\r\n\r\n“With its pointed snout the grain-weevil makes a tiny hole in a kernel\r\nof wheat, and in this it lays an egg which it makes fast by means of a\r\nsticky liquid from its own body. Then it passes immediately to other\r\nkernels and treats them in the same way, until its store of eggs is\r\nexhausted. And all this is done with such delicate nicety that the\r\nsharpest eyes would fail to detect any trace of these mischievous germs\r\nin the kernels. But a weevil knows very well when a kernel has already\r\nreceived an egg, from whatever source, and never does it commit the\r\nblunder of laying a second one there, for the grain of wheat is too\r\nsmall for more than one eater. To each kernel its larva, to each larva\r\nits kernel, and no more.\r\n\r\n“Soon the eggs hatch. The tiny worm punctures the envelop of the grain\r\nand through the almost invisible opening makes its way into the mealy\r\nsubstance within. There it is at home, in perfect quiet, peacefully\r\ndevoted to the pleasures of feasting. For its own exclusive use a grain\r\nof wheat, a whole grain of wheat! Thus it grows big and fat. In five or\r\nsix weeks the flour is all eaten up, but the bran remains, for the\r\nclever larva is careful not to make a hole in it; it will need it to\r\nserve as a cradle during the coming change. The gnawed kernel appears\r\nquite whole, when as a matter of fact it is hollow and lodges a weevil.\r\nIn this hiding-place the larva turns into a nymph, and the latter into\r\na perfect insect. Then the fully developed weevil tears open the bran\r\ncovering and leaves its home to explore the pile of wheat, select\r\ncertain ungnawed grains, and lay its eggs in them, eggs that will in\r\ntime produce a new population of ravagers.”\r\n\r\nHere Uncle Paul picked out a few grains, one by one, and submitted them\r\nto his hearers’ scrutiny.\r\n\r\n“What do you see that is at all unusual in those grains?” he asked.\r\n“Look at them well.”\r\n\r\n“I have looked and looked,” Emile replied after a little, “and I don’t\r\nsee anything.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see anything, either,” said Jules.\r\n\r\n“Nor I,” added Louis.\r\n\r\n“Those grains, boys, have no flour in them, despite their fair outside\r\nappearance; the weevil has emptied them.”\r\n\r\n“But how can you tell so easily?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“A kernel inhabited by the grain-weevil yields to the pressure of a\r\nfinger and is also lighter in weight than one that is sound. From\r\nappearance alone one cannot tell infested kernels from uninjured ones,\r\nas the outside looks the same in both cases. Thus, without extreme\r\nvigilance, the inroads of the weevil pass unperceived until the\r\ndeveloped insects show themselves; and then the evil is beyond remedy.\r\nDidn’t Simon think he had a fine lot of wheat when there was hardly\r\nanything but the bran left? A very simple experiment suffices to prove\r\nthe condition of the wheat. Throw a handful of it into water and all\r\nthe sound kernels will sink to the bottom, all the unsound ones float\r\non the surface. We will perform this experiment with the wheat on the\r\nplate if Jules will go to the spring and bring a glass of water.”\r\n\r\nThe water was brought and Uncle Paul threw the wheat into it. A few\r\ngrains sank, many floated. These latter were opened with the point of a\r\npin, and in some was found a little soft white worm, without legs, but\r\nfurnished with strong mandibles. It was the larva of the grain-weevil.\r\nIn others there was a white nymph, and in a few was the perfect insect\r\nall ready to leave its snug abode.\r\n\r\n“To judge by the number of grains that floated,” Jules remarked,\r\n“Simon’s pile of wheat, even if it is not a very big one, must contain\r\nmillions of weevils. It must have taken a lot of the creatures to\r\nproduce such an immense family, mustn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Not so many as you might think. How many eggs do you suppose one\r\nweevil lays?”\r\n\r\n“A dozen, perhaps.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, how far out you are in your reckoning! In the course of one season\r\na weevil lays from eight to ten thousand eggs, from which spring as\r\nmany larvæ, each gnawing a grain. A liter measure [9] contains, on an\r\naverage, ten thousand grains of wheat. To feed the family of one\r\nweevil, therefore, nearly a liter of wheat is needed. Suppose there are\r\na thousand pairs of these insects in a granary; that would be enough to\r\ndestroy ten hectoliters of wheat, rye, barley, or oats; for they attack\r\nall kinds of grain impartially.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nTHE COMMON CATERPILLAR\r\n\r\n\r\n“I remember,” said Jules, “one Sunday last winter—it was some time in\r\nDecember or January, I think—the mayor had just posted a notice on the\r\ndoor of the town hall, and the people were reading it as they came from\r\nchurch. The notice was something about caterpillars, and the mayor had\r\nordered their nests to be destroyed.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” rejoined Uncle Paul, “the mayor had in mind, luckily for us, the\r\ncaterpillar law.”\r\n\r\n“What! Is there a law about caterpillars, with a fine for disobeying\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my boy, there is a law about caterpillars, and I thank the\r\nlegislature that had the wisdom to pass it. God grant it may become a\r\nmore general statute and include a greater number of our insect\r\nenemies, the June-bug especially, and that it may be strictly\r\nenforced!”\r\n\r\n“But that would put people out, to have to leave their business and go\r\nand hunt for caterpillar-nests and burn them. At least, that’s what\r\nOne-eyed John said when he read the mayor’s notice.”\r\n\r\n“Leave their business, you say? Is it leaving one’s business to go and\r\nsave the crops when they are threatened? Laws, my young friend, are\r\nrules made for the general good, and we should all obey them\r\nscrupulously. If there are any narrow-minded objectors or stupid\r\ngrumblers—any One-eyed Johns, in short—that choose to take offense, so\r\nmuch the worse for them: they will have to obey in any event, for the\r\ncommon interest is not to be compromised by the foolishness of a few.\r\n\r\n“The mayor’s notice had especial reference to a caterpillar whose\r\nravages are, in some seasons, truly calamitous. So abundant is this\r\ncaterpillar in central and northern France that it is called, briefly,\r\nthe common caterpillar. It is encountered everywhere, on fruit-trees\r\nand forest trees, in garden walks and on plants and hedges, and even on\r\nthe bark of trees, sometimes in countless legions.\r\n\r\n“It is dark brown in color with six rows of little tubercles or pimples\r\nof the same hue, each bearing a tuft of long, red hair. The ring-like\r\nsegment to which is attached the last pair of false legs, and also the\r\nfollowing segment, have each a plump red nipple which can at the\r\ncaterpillar’s pleasure recede under the skin or stand out prominently.\r\nThe butterfly developing from this caterpillar is pure white except on\r\nthe abdomen, which is brown. Furthermore, the female has a thick tuft\r\nof red hair at the end of the abdomen. Its purpose is shown when the\r\neggs are laid: after these are deposited, to the number of three or\r\nfour hundred, the butterfly rubs off the hair and places it over the\r\neggs. The laying takes place in July and the eggs, deposited in a\r\nlittle heap on a leaf, are rose red.”\r\n\r\n“But if they are on a leaf,” objected Emile, “they must fall from the\r\ntree when the leaves fall, and then the wind might blow them away.”\r\n\r\n“The butterfly that lays its eggs on a leaf knows very well what it is\r\nabout. On the other hand, those butterflies that lay eggs that are to\r\ngo through the winter and hatch in the spring are very careful not to\r\nentrust their eggs to a leaf, which will soon fall to the ground. They\r\nmake their eggs fast to the bark. But whence do they get their\r\nknowledge of the future? Who told them the leaves would fall and\r\ntherefore would be insecure resting-places for the eggs? They do not\r\nlearn this by experience, for they have never seen the autumnal\r\nshedding of leaves, having been born when the foliage is already well\r\nadvanced for their nourishment, and laying their eggs and dying while\r\nit is still on the trees. If, then, experience cannot account for it,\r\nwe must ascribe the insect’s mysterious foreknowledge to the\r\nincomprehensible inspiration of instinct, which sees the invisible and\r\nknows the unknown because there is a Sovereign Intelligence that knows\r\nall and orders all.\r\n\r\n“Our common caterpillar likewise is led by instinct when it lays its\r\neggs on a leaf, for long before the fall of that leaf they will hatch,\r\nin the last fortnight of July.”\r\n\r\n“A cunning rascal, that caterpillar,” said Emile; “it knows the order\r\nof the seasons as if it had the almanac by heart.”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t told you all. Another motive acts in determining the\r\nbutterfly’s course. In laying its eggs on a leaf the insect places them\r\nwhere the young caterpillars are sure to find food close at hand when\r\nthey come out of the eggs, so that they will not have to go running\r\nabout over the branches, a dangerous thing at their tender age. All\r\nanxiety as to food supply is thus removed at the outset, and this\r\nassurance against famine is so much to the good in this world of chance\r\nand uncertainty, whether for men or caterpillars.”\r\n\r\n“If the butterfly reasoned it all out,” said Jules, “it couldn’t do any\r\nbetter.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not so well, my child. Are there not plenty of people, alas,\r\nthat show far less foresight? The butterfly leaves to its young a leaf\r\nas a heritage, a leaf to eat, whereas the spendthrift, the idler,\r\nleaves to his family nothing but poverty and suffering. He has not even\r\nthe wisdom of an insect.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nCATERPILLARS AT TABLE\r\n\r\n\r\n“In the latter part of July the eggs hatch and through the covering of\r\ndown appear, here and there, little heads pushing aside the fluff that\r\nis in their way. The first caterpillar hatched out crawls forward and\r\nbegins to browse on the upper surface of the leaf, grazing it lightly\r\nand without eating through to the under surface or touching the veins;\r\nit feeds only on the pulpy matter forming most of the leaf’s thickness.\r\nAs the hatching continues, another little caterpillar advances and\r\ntakes its place beside the first, then a third, a fourth, and so on\r\nuntil the whole width of the leaf is occupied. In this way is formed\r\nthe first row of browsing caterpillars, all with heads in a straight\r\nline and leaving in front a certain unoccupied space. The next\r\ncaterpillar to emerge from under the matting of down begins a second\r\nrow by taking its station at the tail of one of the preceding ones,\r\nafter which others place themselves at the right and left. This row\r\ncompleted, a third is formed in the same manner, and then others, so\r\nthat in a short time the entire surface of the leaf except the forward\r\nend is covered with rows of eaters. If one leaf is not enough for the\r\nwhole brood, the later comers establish themselves in like order on\r\nneighboring leaves.\r\n\r\n“There they are, then, all at table. The strictest discipline prevails\r\nin this leafy dining-hall: each caterpillar gnaws what is directly\r\nunder its mandibles, without turning to right or left, as that would\r\ntake from its neighbor’s share; without advancing ahead of its own\r\nline, as that would mean using the supplies of the future; and without\r\nfalling behind, as that would throw the rear ranks into confusion.\r\nUnder these conditions a few mouthfuls and no more fall to each\r\ncaterpillar. That is very little for a larva’s appetite. It must have\r\nmore, but how obtain it? Scatter abroad on other leaves, haphazard?\r\nUndoubtedly there is plenty of room for all on the tree. But that would\r\nbe highly imprudent: they must keep together, for union is the strength\r\nof the weak; they must keep together to be able to offer some sort of\r\nformidable appearance to their enemies. It would be equally\r\nobjectionable for each to be a law to itself and gnaw where it chose on\r\nthe same leaf. The resulting confusion would cause waste, and also it\r\nwould be very difficult for each to get its proper share, some stuffing\r\nthemselves and others near by dying of hunger. In such absence of law\r\nand order they would come to blows and fight desperately for a footing\r\non the leaf, so that civil war would soon thin their ranks, for there\r\nis no worse counselor in such emergencies than the stomach. Order is\r\nthe only solution of their problem, order which safeguards human as\r\nwell as insect communities.”\r\n\r\n“What do they do, then?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“We are coming to that. Each caterpillar, as I said, gnaws only the\r\nspot directly within reach. In this way there is left unbrowsed, first\r\nthe part covered by each body, and then the forward part of the leaf,\r\nwhich is still unoccupied. The first row of caterpillars advances one\r\nstep and finds a second ration in the part thus reached; but at the\r\nsame time it uncovers in the rear a crosswise strip one step wide,\r\nwhich the second row now advances to feed upon, while in its turn it\r\nleaves a similar strip free for the third row; and so on. One step\r\nforward for the whole troop puts each row in possession of the strip\r\nleft uncovered by the preceding row. As for the first row, it feeds\r\nlittle by little on the forward part of the leaf, designedly left\r\nunoccupied in the beginning. When step by step the very end of the leaf\r\nis reached, each caterpillar has gnawed a strip as long and as wide as\r\nits own body. By that time the first meal is finished. You see that\r\nwith order and economy a hundred and more caterpillars all have a place\r\nin the dining-hall on the surface of the leaf, and all have as nearly\r\nequal rations as if these had been allotted by weight and measure.”\r\n\r\n“Animals with their instinct are wonderful creatures, Uncle,” observed\r\nJules. “Every day brings some fresh surprise.”\r\n\r\n“It is not the creature itself that is to be wondered at, my dear\r\nchild; the marvels it accomplishes are not the fruit of its reflection.\r\nA grub just out of the egg can have no ideas on method, economy,\r\ncoöperation, when in order to acquire these ideas man needs the full\r\nmaturity of his reason. Our tribute of admiration should be paid to the\r\nInfinite Wisdom which governs the world and leads a brood of\r\ncaterpillars browsing the surface of a leaf.\r\n\r\n“Their first hunger appeased, the caterpillars construct a shelter from\r\nrain and the heat of the sun. On its gnawed side the leaf is dryer than\r\non the other, and consequently has of itself taken a kind of concave\r\nshape by curling up, which makes it serve excellently for the floor and\r\nwalls of the new abode. As for the ceiling, that is to be of silk. From\r\none raised edge of the leaf to the other the caterpillars stretch\r\nthreads to strengthen their shelter and serve as framework for the\r\nroof, and finally they weave a fabric on this network of threads. Thus\r\nis erected a tent under which the caterpillars take refuge for the\r\nnight after roaming over the foliage most of the day, feeding sometimes\r\non one leaf, sometimes on another. Thither also they retire when the\r\nheat is excessive or the weather threatening. It is a shelter hastily\r\nconstructed and not of enduring quality, besides being too small to\r\nhold them all. So other tents are made of other gnawed leaves, and the\r\ncaterpillars live for a while divided into small families.\r\n\r\n“But with the first rain-storms of autumn, in September or October, a\r\nlarge building is constructed for housing the whole colony through the\r\nwinter. It is a bulky mass of dry leaves and white silk, with no\r\ndefinite shape. The inside is divided with silk partitions into\r\nnumerous apartments to which there is access through holes that pierce,\r\nsystematically, the several partitions. Each enclosure thus has its\r\ndoors which, without being directly opposite each other, yet provide\r\nfree circulation. In short, this common nest, though made of extremely\r\nfine silk, is substantial enough to be proof against wind and weather,\r\nfor the caterpillars use many webs, placed one over another and each\r\ncontaining a great number of threads. With the coming of the first cold\r\nweather all shut themselves up, the doors are barricaded with silk, and\r\neverything is made snug for the winter. Now let the wind blow and the\r\nsnow fall! Curled up together and snuggling against one another, the\r\ncaterpillars sleep the deep sleep produced by the cold, lying torpid in\r\ntheir house of silk until the warmth of opening spring awakens them and\r\nsends them forth to browse on the growing leaves.”\r\n\r\n“And don’t they eat anything all winter?” asked Emile.\r\n\r\n“All winter as well as a part of the autumn and spring they take no\r\nfood whatever. Their fast lasts six months, and it is an absolute fast\r\nthat must leave them with very empty stomachs.”\r\n\r\n“They must be awfully hungry when they wake up.”\r\n\r\n“So hungry that they make a dash for the tender young leaves and\r\nopening flowers, and in less than no time strip an orchard bare. If the\r\nnests are very numerous whole forests are browsed to the last leaf.”\r\n\r\n“And then?”\r\n\r\n“To prevent these ravages the mayor’s notice is heeded. Some time in\r\nthe winter these terrible bags of dry leaves and silk are detached from\r\nthe trees, hedges, and bushes, and the nests with their occupants are\r\nburned. In spring it would be too late: the caterpillars would all have\r\nleft their quarters.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nENEMIES OF THE GRAPEVINE\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning Jules was sent to the mill to give notice that his uncle’s\r\nwheat was ready to be ground. After he had left the village his road\r\nran along beside a vineyard that showed signs of neglect, weeds and\r\nthistles springing up unchecked. Nevertheless the vines were pleasing\r\nto the eye in the spring freshness of their tender green shoots, with\r\ntheir clusters of blossoms still in the bud and their delicate tendrils\r\nreaching out for something to cling to. Here and there leaves of faded\r\nand ragged appearance, with others that were dried up and shriveled,\r\ntook away somewhat from the general effect; but they were not very\r\nnumerous and Jules failed to notice them at first. Afterward, for the\r\nlast half of the way along the vineyard, these withered leaves became\r\nso abundant that the young vine shoots looked as if they had been swept\r\nby a fire.\r\n\r\n“Some ravager is at work here,” said the boy to himself, for his eyes\r\nwere daily becoming more keenly observant. “Let’s look into this a\r\nlittle.”\r\n\r\nThe vines were pitiful to behold, their young shoots showing more and\r\nmore toward the growing end, where the grape clusters were forming,\r\ndried and crumpled leaves, some of these being rolled up like cigars.\r\nUnder closer scrutiny there was often to be seen an insect with a long\r\nbeak, a weevil of a brilliant metallic green color. Without question\r\nthis beautiful weevil was the cause of the mischief. Insects and\r\ncigars, especially the former, sparkling creatures in the bright light\r\nof the sun, were soon collected by Jules as specimens to take home.\r\nJust then One-eyed John, the owner of the vineyard, came along.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing there?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“Catching a few of these insects that are ruining your vines,” the boy\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n“Let me see them.”\r\n\r\n“Here they are.”\r\n\r\n“And you say they are ruining my vines?”\r\n\r\n“I think so. I have just seen some of them making these cigars.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, bosh, you silly! Do you think they would take the trouble to make\r\ncigars out of leaves? They don’t smoke. It’s the moon that has burned\r\nmy vines, the moon.”\r\n\r\nAnd so, satisfied with his explanation, One-eyed John turned on his\r\nheel and went off, whistling a tune. But he would stop whistling when,\r\nthree years later, he had to pull up those vines, exhausted as they\r\nwere by the cigar-rollers. Nevertheless he would not take back what he\r\nhad said: the moon had caused all the mischief.\r\n\r\nReturning from the mill, Jules picked up Louis on the way and brought\r\nhim back to share in the benefit of what Uncle Paul might have to say\r\nconcerning the specimens Jules had collected.\r\n\r\n“The insect found on the vine,” said he, after examining one of the\r\nbrilliant creatures, “is a weevil. You all remember that this name is\r\ngiven to various beetles with a head tapering into a sort of trumpet.\r\nThis one is the rhynchites, as entomologists call it, or the vine-grub,\r\nas it is known to vine-growers. It is of a magnificent lustrous green\r\non the back, and underneath it shines like gold. Some dark-blue ones\r\nare also found, but they are more rare. The male has on each side of\r\nthe thorax a little pointed protuberance directed forward. The larva is\r\na small, white, legless worm that begins life in a roll made by the\r\nmother with a vine leaf. In the month of May she begins operations by\r\ncutting the stem of the leaf three-quarters through to arrest the flow\r\nof sap, so that the leaf may wither and be the easier to roll. Then the\r\nweevil rolls it up and lays three or four eggs in its folds. When in\r\nthe process of drying the leaf has assumed the color of tobacco, you\r\nwould take it for a cigar hanging from the vine. The young larvæ soon\r\nabandon this first shelter, let themselves fall, and burrow into the\r\nground, where they finish developing. The vine-grub saps the vigor of\r\nthe vine by destroying its leaves, and therefore the cigar-like rolls\r\nshould be picked off and burned in May or June. In this way the infant\r\ninsects are destroyed in the cradle and much future damage is\r\nprevented.”\r\n\r\n“Along with the shiny green weevil that rolls vine leaves into cigars I\r\nfound this other insect,” Jules announced, displaying the creature.\r\n\r\n“That is not a weevil, as you can see from the shape of its head, which\r\nhas no tapering beak. Its wing sheaths are chestnut red, the rest of\r\nthe body being black. It is known as the eumolpus or, more commonly,\r\nthe vine-fretter, or, in our language, the scrivener because in gnawing\r\nthe surface of the vine leaves it traces fine lines that look somewhat\r\nlike intricate handwriting. It attacks in the same way the stems of\r\ngrape leaves and of grape clusters, the young shoots of the vine, and\r\nthe grapes themselves. If the insects are numerous, all these incisions\r\nand lacerations cause the vines to wither away and produce but little\r\nfruit, and that of poor quality.\r\n\r\n“The larvæ of the vine-fretter live in the ground, and to destroy them\r\nthe soil thus infested is turned over in the winter, as exposure to the\r\ncold kills the grubs. When the insects are fully developed it is\r\nexceedingly difficult to rid the vines of them. At the slightest alarm\r\nthe little creature, busy with its destructive writing on the leaves,\r\ndraws its legs up under its belly and lets itself drop to the ground,\r\nwhere it cannot be easily seen because of its dull hue; and it also\r\nkeeps perfectly still, playing dead.”\r\n\r\n“Does it think it can escape by not moving?” asked Emile.\r\n\r\n“Doubtless, because then, even if it should by any chance be\r\ndiscovered, it would probably be mistaken for a grain of earth.”\r\n\r\n“Wouldn’t it be better for it to fly away or run away than to play\r\ndead?”\r\n\r\n“Its flight is too heavy and its legs too short. All insects that\r\ncannot take instant flight and are without means of defense do as does\r\nthe vine-fretter in time of danger: they remain perfectly motionless.\r\nNearly always this expedient succeeds with them because their color,\r\ncommonly a dull one, causes them to be confounded with the soil.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, the sly rogues!”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, this ruse of the vine-fretter must be turned to account by\r\nus in our efforts to exterminate the insect. Under the vine we stretch\r\na cloth, after which a sharp blow is given to the main stem. The\r\nvine-fretters let themselves fall, they play dead, but they can be seen\r\non the cloth and not one escapes the sad fate awaiting it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nCLEVER MISCHIEF-MAKERS\r\n\r\n\r\n“Here is another weevil I have to show you,” began Uncle Paul the next\r\nday. “What do you think of it? Note its shiny violet coat with glints\r\nof blue that bring out the delicate down with which the whole body is\r\ncovered. The purple of our richest silks is not so magnificent.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, the pretty little thing!” cried Emile. “What can it do with its\r\nbeautiful clothes?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing to our advantage, my boy. Fine clothes do not make useful\r\ncitizens, either among insects or among men. The bee’s dress is a\r\nmodest brown, and the bee works at honey-making; the dress of the\r\nweevil I show you here is very handsome, but the elegant creature lives\r\nat our expense. If you have in your garden any fine plums or pears or\r\napples, it gets ahead of you in harvesting the crop; it does not even\r\nwait for the fruit to ripen, so fearful is it of being too late. In\r\nJune it punctures with its pointed snout the young apple or pear or\r\nplum and lays an egg in the unripe flesh. The fruit thus treated feeds\r\nthe larva for some time, and then dries up and falls off. Then the worm\r\nemigrates, leaves the plum that has nourished it, and buries itself in\r\nthe ground to reappear the next spring as a perfect insect.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to know the name of this plum-pricker; I’d teach it to\r\nbehave if I got hold of it.”\r\n\r\n“It is called, very inappropriately, the rhynchites bacchus.”\r\n\r\n“Bacchus, if I remember rightly,” said Jules, “is the god of wine.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly; and that is where the word is out of place here. No doubt the\r\nfirst observers confounded the weevil of our orchards with that of our\r\nvineyards, giving to the former the name that should belong to the\r\nlatter. But the mistake has been made and we can’t do anything about it\r\nnow. Let us keep the names as they are, but not confound the two\r\nweevils so different in appearance and habits. The weevil that rolls\r\nthe vine leaves is hairless and of a golden-green color; the other is\r\nall covered with hairs and its color is a lustrous violet. To avoid\r\nconfusion in our talk, why should we not call this latter insect the\r\nplum-weevil, or the pear-weevil?”\r\n\r\n“That would be a good name for it,” assented Louis.\r\n\r\n“I shall just call it the plum-pricker,” declared Emile.\r\n\r\n“There is no reason why you should not,” his uncle agreed. “Now let us\r\npass on to another member of the family. See what widely dissimilar\r\nhabits there are in a group of insects in which the expert eye can\r\nnevertheless perceive close resemblances, I might almost say a near\r\nrelationship. Some roll grape or oak or poplar leaves; others puncture\r\nfruit with the beak; this one here that I am going to tell you about\r\nsevers—partly, never wholly—the tips of young and tender shoots of\r\nvarious fruit-trees. Hence they are commonly known as bud-cutters. It\r\nis a weevil, but much smaller than that of the grapevine. The adjective\r\nconical is given to it on account of the shape of its thorax or\r\nbreastplate, which tapers a little toward the front like a sugar-loaf.\r\nIt is rather lustrous and of a blue color shading into green.\r\n\r\n“It shows remarkable cleverness in its operations. Establishing itself\r\nin spring on a pear, cherry, apricot, plum, or hawthorn tree,\r\nindifferently, it selects one by one the shoots that suit it, and in\r\nthe not yet unfolded terminal bud it bores with its beak a tiny hole,\r\nin which it lays an egg. But it appears that the young larva requires a\r\ndiet especially prepared for it, one that is slightly decomposed, and\r\nnot the bitter juices of the vigorously growing shoot. Have not we\r\nourselves similar tastes? Do we eat medlars and sorb-apples just as\r\nthey come from the tree? No indeed; they must first be left to ripen on\r\nstraw, even to decay a little.”\r\n\r\n“Then they are first-rate,” was Emile’s pronouncement; “but before that\r\nthey are horrid.”\r\n\r\n“That is what the larva of the weevil would say about the shoot on\r\nwhich it has just hatched out. Before being treated it is bitter, it\r\nrasps the throat and sets the mandibles on edge; after treatment it is\r\ndelicious.”\r\n\r\n“Yet it doesn’t put the branch to ripen on straw as we do medlars?”\r\n\r\n“No. In most cases larvæ show no ingenuity whatever; they eat like\r\ngluttons and without a thought for anything but eating. You know well\r\nenough that giving oneself up to gorging is hardly the way to improve\r\nthe mind. For these larvæ, then, a ready-made pap has to be provided,\r\nas otherwise, not knowing how to prepare it themselves, they would\r\nstupidly starve to death. And who prepares the food and makes it just\r\nright for them? The mother, if you please, the mother whose great and\r\nonly occupation it is to provide for the future needs of her unborn\r\nyoung. She makes it her business to find for them food that not only\r\nhas no nourishment in it for herself, but which she dislikes; she\r\ndenies herself the enjoyment of flowery fields and summer sunshine to\r\ndevote all her energies to arduous labors that are of no advantage to\r\nher personally; and when she has spent her little span of life at this\r\nhard task she retires into a corner and dies content: the table is set,\r\nthe young larvæ will not lack for food.\r\n\r\n“When you see the weevil on a vine leaf, sparkling like a precious gem,\r\ndo not think it is there to enjoy itself. It is spending itself in the\r\ndifficult undertaking of sawing the leaf half-way through at the stem,\r\nafter which it will roll the leaf into a sheath to serve as lodging and\r\nfirst food for the larvæ. Its whole life of two or three weeks is given\r\nto this work. How can it benefit the insect itself to saw leaf stems\r\nand make the leaves wither in the sun and then roll them up? In no way\r\nwhatever; the weevil does not eat these leaves or lodge in the sheath\r\nmade by rolling one of them up. It spends its energies in this work\r\nsolely for the larvæ that are to be hatched out after its death. Have\r\nyou ever reflected, my children, on this perpetual miracle,—the miracle\r\nof a mother living only for her little ones, little ones that she is\r\ndestined never to see? I will not conceal from you that every time I\r\nthink of this maternal foresight, this laborious preparation for a\r\nfuture unknown to the mother herself, I feel myself deeply moved. The\r\nAll-seeing Eye is there.\r\n\r\n“In a way peculiar to itself the conical weevil makes ready the pap\r\nthat is to feed its family. The larvæ, as I said, require the mild\r\njuices of a shoot that has been deprived of its natural vigor. What\r\ndoes the mother do to put the branch in the proper condition? Under the\r\nspot where the egg is laid she cuts away the bark and some of the wood\r\nin a circle, with her fine mandibles, leaving the shoot supported only\r\nby the central portion of the stem. The sap no longer circulating\r\nbeyond this girdle, the leaves affected soon wither and the entire tip\r\nof the shoot turns black and acquires that state of decay best liked by\r\nthe new-born grub.”\r\n\r\n“I knew how to ripen medlars on straw,” said Emile, “but I should have\r\nbeen puzzled to tell how to ripen a branch of a tree. What curious\r\ncreatures those are, with their clever ways of doing things! One can do\r\none thing and another can do another, and it is always ingenious and\r\nnever the same.”\r\n\r\n“It is vexatious that all too often the insect’s labors involve harm\r\nand loss to us. When a fruit-tree has been operated on by the conical\r\nweevil you can see, in the month of May, the tips of the shoots hanging\r\nwithered and blackened, after which they dry up and fall.”\r\n\r\n“Do the larvæ stay in the tips of the fallen branches?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“What would they do there? Food would fail them, and so they bury\r\nthemselves in the ground to finish their growth and pass the winter\r\nthere snugly and safely. In the spring their metamorphosis takes\r\nplace.”\r\n\r\n“Then to guard against insect ravages for the next year,” said Louis,\r\n“the withered shoots that hang from the trees should be collected and\r\nburned while the larvæ are still there.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is the best thing to do.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\nNUT-WEEVILS AND FLOWER-WEEVILS\r\n\r\n\r\n“Ha, you rascal, I’ve caught you at it now, eating my hazelnuts!” cried\r\nLouis one day on seeing a weevil piercing with its long beak a still\r\ntender young nut. “I’ve caught you at it. But first I’ll learn all\r\nabout you, and then we’ll have a reckoning.”\r\n\r\nThe weevil was placed in a paper cornucopia together with some pierced\r\nhazelnuts, and in his first spare moment Louis hastened to Uncle Paul’s\r\nhouse, his cheeks flushed with excitement. Little Louis was very fond\r\nof hazelnuts, and to catch in the very act the insect that attacks them\r\nwas a very serious matter, to his thinking. In the evening Uncle Paul\r\nhad his usual audience around him to listen to his account of the\r\nhazelnut-weevil.\r\n\r\n“Here is the little insect Louis has caught,” he began. “Look at its\r\nbeak a moment.”\r\n\r\n“What a nose!” exclaimed Emile. “Oh, what a nose! It is as slender as a\r\nhair and very long and turned back at the end.”\r\n\r\n“Doesn’t it look as if it were smoking a long pipe, as I said the other\r\nday?” asked Louis.\r\n\r\n“See, Uncle,” Emile pointed out, “how close together its eyes are; they\r\nalmost touch each other, and the insect seems to be squinting. How\r\nfunny it is, with its nose like a pipe-stem and its squinting eyes!”\r\n\r\n“Where is its mouth?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“At the very end of what Emile calls its long nose,” his uncle replied.\r\n\r\n“How does it manage to eat? Food must have a hard time getting through\r\nthat stem not so big around as a thread.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, how does it manage to eat?” Emile chimed in. “I should be in a\r\nterrible fix if I had to take my food through a straw as long as\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\n“The weevil is obliged to exercise moderation; at the most it drinks\r\nwith its beak only a few drops of sap from the hazelnut-tree it\r\ninhabits. But if the weevil is temperate in its diet, the larva of the\r\nweevil eats with a good appetite: it demands the whole kernel of a\r\nhazelnut, and it is on purpose to give the larva this food that the\r\nweevil is provided with the long beak that astonishes you. The perfect\r\ninsect, I repeat, lives much more for its future family than for\r\nitself, its equipment being designed with reference to the future of\r\nits young. If the weevil had to think merely of its own food its\r\ntrumpet would be highly inconvenient; but it must above all look out\r\nfor the well-being of its larvæ, and to make provision for that, the\r\ncreature’s long and slender beak is a wonderful tool, serving as a fine\r\ngimlet for boring through the nutshell so that the egg may be laid in\r\nthe very meat itself and the larva be hatched out in the lap of\r\nplenty.”\r\n\r\n“That must be a long, hard job for so fine a gimlet,” Jules remarked.\r\n\r\n“Not at all. The tiny mandibles at the end of the trumpet bite the\r\nshell almost as easily as an edged tool of steel would do it; and\r\nmoreover the weevil chooses its time. It is in May, when the hazelnuts\r\nare beginning to grow and their shells are soft, that the task is\r\nundertaken. The insect attacks the nut at the base through the green\r\ncovering called the cup. As soon as the hole is made, an egg is laid\r\ninside the nut and in a week the larva is hatched out. It is a legless\r\nworm, white with a red head. As the grub eats very little at first, the\r\nhazelnut continues to grow and its kernel to ripen, though gnawed\r\nlittle by little. When August comes, the store of provision is\r\nexhausted and the wormy nut lies on the ground. Then the worm, its\r\nmandibles strong by this time, makes a round hole in the empty shell\r\nand, leaving the nut, buries itself in the ground, where it undergoes\r\ntransformation the following spring.”\r\n\r\n“When I am cracking nuts with my teeth,” said Emile, “I once in a while\r\nbite into something bitter and soft.”\r\n\r\n“That is the grub of the weevil.”\r\n\r\n“Pah! The nasty thing!”\r\n\r\n“How can I keep the creatures off my hazelnut-trees?” asked Louis.\r\n\r\n“That is very simple. Gather the wormy nuts, which sooner or later fall\r\nto the ground just as does fruit attacked by insects. If they are not\r\npierced with a large hole the worm is still there. By burning them you\r\ndestroy the weevils of the following year.”\r\n\r\n“But this year’s weevils will be left.”\r\n\r\n“No, for it is a rule that insects die soon after laying their eggs.”\r\n\r\n“You haven’t told us the name of this hazelnut-eater,” said Jules.\r\n\r\n“It is called the hazelnut-balaninus or hazelnut-weevil, and you can\r\neasily recognize it by its very fine, long, and recurved beak, as also\r\nby the yellowish-gray down that covers the whole of the insect.\r\n\r\n“Another balaninus, smaller but of the same shape and color, lives in\r\nacorns in its larva state, and is known as the oak-balaninus. A third,\r\nnot very often seen around here, lives in cherry-stones. It is the\r\ncherry-balaninus.”\r\n\r\n“How different they all are in their ways of living!” Jules remarked.\r\n“The grain-weevil gnaws the kernels of grain; the vine-weevils and\r\nfruit-weevils roll leaves or prick pears and plums or cut the buds; and\r\nnow here are the nut-weevils that attack the hazelnut-meat, the\r\ncherry-stone, and the acorn. Are there any that eat flowers?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed there are. No part of a plant is spared by insects. The\r\napple-tree, the pear-tree, and the cherry-tree have each its peculiar\r\nweevil that in its larva state lives at the expense of the flower buds.\r\nThese ravagers are called by a Greek name meaning flower-eaters. See\r\nthis apple-tree weevil, the one most familiar to us. It is brown, with\r\na small white stripe edged with black and placed slantwise on the end\r\nof each wing sheath. Beginning in April, it spreads over the\r\napple-trees and pierces the flower buds with its fine beak, laying an\r\negg in each one. A week later the larva is hatched out, and immediately\r\nthe little worm begins to gnaw the flower that is curled up in the bud.\r\nOnly the outside covering is left intact by this devourer. Of course a\r\nbud that has had its heart eaten out cannot blossom, and so flower and\r\nfruit are both lost. The damaged buds, being gnawed only within, keep\r\ntheir shape and take in drying the appearance of cloves.”\r\n\r\n“Those cloves that Mother Ambroisine puts in stews?” asked Emile.\r\n\r\n“The same.”\r\n\r\n“What are cloves?”\r\n\r\n“They are, as I have already told you, [10] the buds or unopened\r\nflowers of the clove-tree, an aromatic bush growing in hot countries.\r\nThey are gathered before opening and are dried in the sun.”\r\n\r\n“I see why buds pricked by the flower-weevil look like cloves. In both\r\ncases they are buds that have dried up without opening.”\r\n\r\n“The larva of the flower-weevil, like those of weevils in general, is a\r\ntiny legless worm, white in color. It does not leave the bud it has\r\ngnawed when this falls from the tree. The larva of the nut-weevil\r\nleaves its nut by boring a hole through the shell, that of the conical\r\nweevil leaves the fallen shoot, the vine-weevil lets itself drop out of\r\nits rolled leaf, and all three bury themselves in the ground to pass\r\nthe winter in safety and be transformed the following spring. The larva\r\nof the flower-weevil is more expeditious: its change into an insect\r\ntakes place as soon as it has eaten its bud, so that there is no need\r\nfor it to leave its quarters. As animals never do anything without a\r\npurpose, the grub remains shut up in the dry bud. Six weeks after the\r\negg is laid the larva emerges transformed into a perfect insect and\r\nflits from one apple-tree to another all summer. Then comes the\r\nwinter.”\r\n\r\n“That must be a trying time,” said Jules.\r\n\r\n“Many perish, but others survive, hidden under moss, in the cracks of\r\nbark, or among dry leaves. Indeed, there are plenty of them left to\r\ndestroy the buds on our apple-trees when spring comes.\r\n\r\n“The flower-weevil of the pear-tree and that of the cherry-tree\r\nresemble the one I have just shown you, and their habits are exactly\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n“It is not easy to get rid of these flower-destroyers. If one had only\r\na few trees to take care of, and those easy to get at in every part,\r\none could if necessary gather and burn the dry buds inhabited by the\r\nlarvæ. By this painstaking process some of the following year’s fruit\r\nmight be saved; but not even so should we get rid of all the\r\nflower-weevils, as these insects fly well and far and they would come\r\nfrom the surrounding region after we had destroyed all our own.\r\nBesides, the gathering of injured buds is impracticable on a large\r\nscale.”\r\n\r\n“Will these little flower-eaters come to be masters of our orchards?”\r\nasked Jules. “Will they destroy our apples and pears in the bud, and\r\ncan’t we do anything to prevent it?”\r\n\r\n“They would indeed be masters had we not vigilant guards, sharp-eyed\r\nhelpers, that from sunrise to sunset lie in wait for insects and hunt\r\nthem with a patience, skill, and industry that none of us would be\r\ncapable of.”\r\n\r\n“You mean the birds?” said Emile.\r\n\r\n“Yes, the birds. When you see on an apple-tree in bloom a little bird\r\nhopping from branch to branch, warbling and pecking, thank God, my\r\nchildren, for giving us the charming creature that with every peck of\r\nits beak delivers us from an enemy.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\nENEMIES OF CLOVER\r\n\r\n\r\n“Would you like to see another little creature that by reason of its\r\nvery smallness and its countless numbers braves our wrath and commits\r\nravages that can be checked only by our agricultural helpers, the foes\r\nof our foes? Here it is.”\r\n\r\n“I see it, with its long beak,” cried Jules; “it is another weevil.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, how tiny it is!” exclaimed Emile. “Surely it can’t eat very much.”\r\n\r\n“It is small, but so numerous that to feed its larvæ it requires whole\r\nfields of clover; not the entire plant, but only the blossom, as with\r\nthe larvæ of the flower-weevil.”\r\n\r\n“What gluttons! They think they must have blossoms, tender and\r\nsweet-smelling.”\r\n\r\n“It is the clover-weevil, and it measures scarcely three millimeters in\r\nlength. The body, of a uniform black, is slightly globular behind. You\r\nknow clover well enough, with its blossoms massed in a round head.\r\nWell, the clover-weevil lays its eggs on the flower-head before the\r\nblossoms open.”\r\n\r\n“Without boring into each flower separately to lay its eggs in?” Jules\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n“The weevil does not take that trouble. The larvæ must manage for\r\nthemselves. As soon as it is hatched out each one pierces the base of\r\nthe flower that suits it and works its way inside. Once there, it eats\r\nthe heart of the bud, especially the part that would have become fruit,\r\nthe little pod with its seeds. That done, it takes on its insect form.\r\n\r\n“Another weevil, equally small and equally numerous, runs neck and neck\r\nwith this one in destroying clover blossoms. It is black, with yellow\r\nlegs. Both abound in cultivated fields. In winter they can be found\r\ngathered at the foot of trees, waiting for the clover to bloom before\r\nthey go to work.\r\n\r\n“You might think these two weevils enough to destroy this useful forage\r\nplant; but there are others still, some larger and some smaller, and\r\nall eager to get at the poor clover. It would almost seem as if insects\r\nhad agreed to attack especially those plants that are useful to man.\r\nThey set to work, by threes, by fours, by tens, and even by hundreds if\r\nneed be, to carry out their ruinous operations, some on the flowers,\r\nothers on the roots, and still others on the leaves and stems of our\r\nmost valuable plants. The grapevine has its caterpillars, beetles, and\r\nlice; wheat feeds destroyers still more numerous and varied, such as\r\nweevils, moths, white worms, gnats, and many others; and for the\r\npear-tree alone we can count five hundred ravagers, perhaps more.”\r\n\r\n“Do they want to starve us, then?” Jules again inquired.\r\n\r\n“What shall I say? They go to work in a way to frighten one. You ask\r\ntheir motive. I will try to show you some other time; but now let us\r\nfinish our talk on the enemies of clover.\r\n\r\n“This one, here in my hand, is known by the learned as the\r\nclover-hylast. It is a tiny brown beetle with truncated wing sheaths\r\nlike those of the bark-beetle, which it closely resembles. In fact it\r\nbelongs to the same family. While the clover-weevil is busy destroying\r\nthe blossoms, this creature stays in the ground and gnaws the roots of\r\nthe plant.\r\n\r\n“We have now the roots, the blossoms, and the young shoots devoured.\r\nWho will look after the leaves? ‘I,’ replies a little beetle with a\r\nrounded back and a flattened stomach, and called the globular lasia; ‘I\r\nwill do it so that man shall not find anything to mow after we get\r\nthrough with the clover.’\r\n\r\n“You are familiar with the ladybird or ladybug, that little red beetle\r\nwith tiny black spots on its back, the good God’s insect. Never molest\r\nit when you find it in the garden. It works for us, going from one\r\nplant to another, devouring lice, those pot-bellied creatures that in\r\ncountless swarms infest the tender shoots of plants and suck the sap.\r\nThe ladybird eats our enemies, plant-lice; it dotes on them. Do not\r\ndisturb it.\r\n\r\n“The insect known as the globular lasia is of the same family as the\r\nladybird, and like the latter it is round and red and has black spots,\r\nbut they are placed differently and usually number about a dozen on\r\neach wing sheath. The larva is yellow and all bristling with little\r\nhairs that stand up like tiny thorns. Both the larva and the mature\r\ninsect live, not on lice, but on leaves, whether of clover, vetch,\r\nlucerne, or some other plant. The marks they make on the gnawed leaves\r\nlook like furrows made by a four-toothed comb.\r\n\r\n“Finally, who is to take in hand the stems of the clover? This task\r\nwill fall to various caterpillars equipped with good teeth and strong\r\njaws, as for example the glyphic noctua, a rather pretty moth with\r\nupper wings bearing irregular spots encircled each by a light-gray\r\nthread on a brown background, and lower wings brightly spotted with a\r\nlight shade of yellow.\r\n\r\n“On every part of the clover, on stems and blossoms, leaves and roots,\r\nravenous devourers are now installed. Have I exhausted the list? By no\r\nmeans. There are others in plenty, if only to take the leavings of\r\nthose I have named.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\nCABBAGE-EATERS\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day Jacques came in from the garden with a cabbage root all covered\r\nwith warts having the shape and size of a pea. In each wart was a\r\nlittle worm.\r\n\r\n“Some of the cabbages are withering away,” announced the old gardener,\r\n“though there are no worms on the leaves. I think the trouble comes\r\nfrom the warts on the roots.”\r\n\r\n“You have guessed right, my good Jacques,” replied Uncle Paul. “Leave\r\nme that root and pull up all the cabbages that appear to you to be\r\naffected. Of course you will burn all the diseased roots. By so doing\r\nyou will arrest the evil in the beginning, as the insect causing the\r\nmischief is rare with us. The important thing is not to let it multiply\r\nin the garden, even if we have to throw away many of the cabbages in\r\nexterminating it.”\r\n\r\nUncle Paul’s instructions were followed, and no more warty roots have\r\nbeen seen since. Next day the cabbage’s enemies were the subject of\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n“Cultivated plants,” said Uncle Paul, “are more exposed to the ravages\r\nof insects than the same plants in a wild state, because they are of a\r\nfiner flavor, tenderer, and of more luxuriant growth. Let us first\r\nconsider the cabbage, now that Jacques has furnished us the occasion.\r\n\r\n“Look at this root, quite covered with ugly warts, hollow inside. I\r\nopen one. What do we find within? A small worm, a larva that would, if\r\nleft undisturbed, develop into a weevil with a beak that lies down on\r\nthe breast between the forelegs when the insect curls up and plays\r\ndead. This weevil is known to men of science as belonging to a genus\r\ncalled ceuthorhynchus, a name formed from two Greek words and meaning\r\nsnout-hider. It is black, with grayish hairs on the back and white\r\nscales on the belly. Its thorax has a deep furrow and its wing sheaths\r\nare ornamented with fine parallel grooves.\r\n\r\n“It lays its eggs about the beginning of summer. The insect works its\r\nway down to the root and punctures it here and there with its beak,\r\nlaying an egg in each puncture. In flowing around the wounded part the\r\nsap of the plant forms a knob or fleshy wart in which the larva grows\r\nuntil the end of October, when the worm leaves this nest to bury itself\r\nin the ground, safe from the cold, and undergo transformation. The\r\npunctured root exhausts its energies in bleeding sap to form the warts\r\noccupied by the larvæ, so that the cabbage rapidly withers away; and in\r\nthis manner the cabbage-weevil makes itself an enemy much to be feared,\r\nespecially in England where it is extremely common. Nor does it confine\r\nits depredations to cabbages; it attacks turnips also, and radishes and\r\nrape.”\r\n\r\n“This weevil seems to eat a good many things,” said Jules. “I thought\r\neach kind of insect always fed on one particular plant.”\r\n\r\n“You were not far wrong, my boy. In most cases insects have very\r\nexclusive tastes, each confining itself to one kind of plant and\r\ndisdaining all others. Sometimes, however, they vary their diet, and as\r\nthey are connoisseurs, very well up on vegetable flavors, in changing\r\ntheir food they choose plants having nearly identical nutritive\r\nproperties, taste, and smell. Do not we ourselves find in the radish\r\nand the turnip something of the smell and taste of the cabbage?”\r\n\r\n“That’s so,” assented Louis.\r\n\r\n“We find more or less similarity in the qualities characteristic of a\r\ngreat many other plants grouped together by botanists in the family of\r\ncruciferæ and including, for instance, the cress, the radish, and\r\ncolza.”\r\n\r\n“Botanists, cruciferæ—I don’t know very well what those are,” said\r\nEmile.\r\n\r\n“No, those are strange words to you. Botanists are learned persons who\r\nspend their time studying plants and who tell us their names and\r\nproperties, differences and resemblances, where they grow and when they\r\nblossom, with other matters of that sort.”\r\n\r\n“And cruciferæ?”\r\n\r\n“That word means cross-bearers and is applied to a large group of\r\nplants with blossoms having four pieces or petals placed two by two,\r\nopposite each other, so as to form a sort of cross. A good example is\r\nthe colza blossom. Plants with cross-shaped flowers include the\r\ncabbage, rape, turnip, radish, clove, colza, cress, and many others.”\r\n\r\n“They are all cruciferæ?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, all cruciferæ. But their likeness is not confined to the shape of\r\nthe blossom; their inner properties also, such as smell, taste, and the\r\nrest, are the same, or very nearly so. Consequently, the\r\ncabbage-weevil, as knowing a little creature as can be found, goes to\r\nthe turnip when there are no cabbages to be had, to the colza if\r\nturnips also are lacking, or to other plants still, but always to some\r\nmember of the cruciferæ family. Other insects show this same\r\npeculiarity, each species having its particular group of plants and\r\ngoing from one to another without ever making a mistake as to family.”\r\n\r\n“Then they are expert botanists, I should say,” Jules remarked.\r\n\r\n“One might almost think so; at least they show in their choice so keen\r\na discernment that often men of science go to school to them to learn\r\nthe various degrees of relationship in the plant world.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Uncle Paul, you are joking!” exclaimed Jules.\r\n\r\n“Joking? Listen. You know the nasturtium, that beautiful orange-colored\r\nflower ending at the bottom in a kind of horn; and you know the\r\nmignonette, that sweet-smelling plant that Mother Ambroisine grows in\r\nthe window.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know them.”\r\n\r\n“Then tell me whether you find between mignonette, nasturtium, and\r\ncabbage any resemblance, any sign of plant-relationship.”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed! Those three plants are wholly unlike one another: their\r\nflowers haven’t the same shape, nor their leaves, nor yet their fruit.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear boy, you, who rather pride yourself on knowing something\r\nabout flowers, really know much less about them than a poor little\r\ngreen caterpillar very common in our gardens; and many persons of far\r\nmore learning than you could take lessons from this same caterpillar.\r\nIt feeds indifferently on various cruciferæ, such as the cabbage, rape,\r\nand the turnip; but it also feeds on the nasturtium and the mignonette.\r\nWhy? You must ask the scientists who make a thorough study of plants\r\nand are determined to find out the minutest details concerning them.\r\nThey would tell you that there is something in their innermost\r\nstructure, something invisible to our untrained eyes, that makes the\r\nnasturtium and the mignonette very nearly akin to the cruciferæ without\r\nlooking like them. It is enough to puzzle anybody, I admit. A worthless\r\ncaterpillar has, from the beginning of the world, eaten mignonette as\r\nwell as turnip, cabbage as well as nasturtium, and has been familiar\r\nwith plant-relationships unsuspected by science until our own time.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to see this caterpillar that knows so much about\r\nplants.”\r\n\r\n“Your desire shall be gratified without delay.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\nA DESTRUCTIVE FAMILY\r\n\r\n\r\nThey went out to the garden and Uncle Paul hunted for some time in the\r\ncabbage bed before he found what he wanted.\r\n\r\n“Here is the caterpillar we were talking about,” he announced at last.\r\n“It is of a delicate green color with three yellow stripes running\r\nlengthwise. Now you must make the acquaintance of the butterfly. Jules,\r\ngo and bring me the net.”\r\n\r\nUncle Paul had a large gauze net, the mouth of which was attached to a\r\nhoop of coarse iron wire fastened to the end of a long stick. That was\r\nhis butterfly-net, and in his leisure moments he used it for catching\r\nbutterflies, that he might destroy them before they laid their eggs on\r\nthe plants in the garden. The more butterflies destroyed, the fewer\r\nhundreds of caterpillars a little later. Jules came back with the net,\r\nbut the chase did not accomplish the desired result, though another\r\nbutterfly was caught very much like the one they were after.\r\n\r\n“We must be content with this,” said Uncle Paul. “My butterfly-hunting\r\nof the last few days seems to have left us none of the sort I am\r\nlooking for; so we will not waste any more time.\r\n\r\n“The insect I have just caught is known as the cabbage-butterfly. Its\r\nwings are white, the forward ones having black tips and two or three\r\nspots of the same color in the middle.”\r\n\r\n“I see that butterfly everywhere,” declared Emile.\r\n\r\n“It is in fact one of the most widely prevalent species. Its\r\ncaterpillar is greenish, marked with black dots and three longitudinal\r\nyellow stripes. It does not spin a cocoon for its metamorphosis. The\r\nchrysalis is spotted with yellow and black, and is found near where the\r\ncaterpillar lived, suspended from a wall or a tree in a very ingenious\r\nmanner. Before shedding its skin the caterpillar emits its small supply\r\nof liquid silk, gluing the end of its tail to the spot it has selected\r\nand then spinning a fine band which it passes across its body,\r\nfastening the two ends at right and left on the stone or the bark to\r\nwhich it is clinging. These preliminaries concluded, the chrysalis\r\nstage is reached, the chrysalis being held firmly in place with its\r\nlower end glued to the supporting object and its upper half kept from\r\nfalling by the silk band.”\r\n\r\n“Without any cocoon to protect it?” asked Emile.\r\n\r\n“Without any cocoon whatever; hence it is called a naked chrysalis.\r\nMany other caterpillars adopt the same method: having only a scanty\r\nlittle drop of liquid silk, much too small a quantity for spinning a\r\ncocoon, they content themselves, when their metamorphosis approaches,\r\nwith gluing their tail to some object and supporting themselves further\r\nwith a narrow band. It is to be noted that butterflies from\r\ncaterpillars that do not spin cocoons all have very slender antennæ\r\nending abruptly in a rounded protuberance or swelling, and that they\r\nfly by day in the brightest sunshine. They are butterflies proper, as\r\ndistinguished from moths. These latter have the chrysalis enclosed in a\r\ncocoon, and their antennæ are sometimes of a feathery appearance,\r\nsometimes spindle-shaped, or they may take the form of elongated clubs,\r\nor, finally, they may be thread-like, tapering but little toward the\r\nend. They fly mostly in the evening twilight, or even in the night.\r\nCompare the antennæ of the cabbage-butterfly with those of the\r\nsilkworm-moth or the leopard-moth and you will see how easy it is to\r\ndistinguish a butterfly from a moth, a cocoonless from a\r\ncocoon-spinning insect.”\r\n\r\n“Then that’s all you have to do—just see whether the antennæ end in a\r\nlittle round swelling,” said Jules.\r\n\r\n“With something on the antennæ,” repeated Emile, “no cocoon; without\r\nthat, a cocoon. How easy it is!”\r\n\r\n“As the youngest and giddiest of my hearers has understood my\r\nexplanation so well, I will pass on. Let us return to the butterfly\r\nwhose caterpillar is so interesting to Jules because it eats\r\nindifferently cabbages, turnips, radishes, nasturtiums, and mignonette.\r\nThis butterfly is very much like the cabbage-butterfly. It too is\r\nwhite, with black spots on the forward wings, but not of so deep a\r\nshade. Furthermore it is about a third smaller. It is called the\r\nradish-butterfly. To distinguish these two species, so much alike in\r\ncoloring and both feeding on the same plants, gardeners call the former\r\nthe big cabbage-butterfly, and the latter the little\r\ncabbage-butterfly.”\r\n\r\n“I know those butterflies,” Jules interposed. “Many a time I’ve seen\r\nboth kinds on the flowers in the garden, and I got them mixed because\r\nthere is hardly any difference in their color. Now I shall know how to\r\ntell them apart. The larger one is the cabbage-butterfly, the smaller\r\nthe radish-butterfly.”\r\n\r\n“You must bear in mind that the words cabbage and radish used to\r\ndesignate the two butterflies do not mean that the caterpillar of the\r\none eats exclusively cabbages and that of the other only radishes. As a\r\nmatter of fact, the names could be reversed without any impropriety,\r\nfor both caterpillars, as occasion offers, feed on either the cabbage,\r\nthe radish, the turnip, or some other cruciferous plant. But let it be\r\nnoted also that these two terms have been chosen as substantially true\r\nto the facts, though likely to mislead if taken in too literal a sense.\r\n\r\n“The same remark applies to a third species, the turnip-butterfly,\r\nwhose caterpillar feeds not only on the leaves of turnip plants, but\r\nalso on those of the nasturtium, the mignonette, the radish, cabbage,\r\nand many other crucifers. It is of about the size of the\r\nradish-butterfly, and its wings are white with greenish veins\r\nunderneath. The forward wings have also black spots on their upper\r\nsurfaces. The caterpillar is slightly hairy and of a uniform green\r\ncolor with no yellow stripes running lengthwise.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\nFLIERS WITH WINGS OF GAUZE\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestioned as to the means to be adopted in order to protect from their\r\ninsect enemies the various plants he had mentioned in his last talk,\r\nUncle Paul was forced to acknowledge the inadequacy of any preventive\r\nmeasures at our command.\r\n\r\n“For protecting a few square yards of cabbage-patch from these\r\ndevourers,” he explained, “a rigorous search for worms and an incessant\r\nchase after butterflies on that particular piece of land might prove\r\neffective; but how keep watch over acres and acres, with butterflies\r\nand moths of many kinds flying all about and alighting every moment to\r\nlay their eggs? The cost of any such watchfulness would far exceed the\r\nvalue of the crop. And so it is in general, with all raising of farm\r\nproducts on a large scale: when once the enemy is in possession it is\r\nall but impossible to drive him out if we depend on our own resources,\r\nhowever much we may spend in the attempt. Because of their infinite\r\nnumbers the insects always have the advantage of us. But fortunately\r\nthere are others fighting for us, and they wage valiant warfare against\r\nour insect foes, especially against worms and caterpillars.”\r\n\r\n“You mean the birds?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and other equally useful helpers that you have never heard of,\r\nnotwithstanding the immense service they render us. I refer to the\r\ninsects belonging to the order known as hymenoptera.”\r\n\r\n“Hymenoptera? I’ve never heard that word before.”\r\n\r\n“And for that reason I hasten to explain its meaning to you. You are\r\nfamiliar with the honey-bee, the bumblebee, and the wasp. Like\r\nbutterflies, they have four wings for flying; but these wings, instead\r\nof being covered with scales—those scales that come off on your hand\r\nand look like dust—are simply membranes of a transparent or gauzy\r\nappearance. Hence the name hymenoptera that is given to these insects,\r\na Latin name that may be translated as ‘membranous-winged creatures.’\r\nFurthermore, they have at the end of the abdomen a very fine sting\r\nwhich comes out of its sheath when the irritated insect seeks to defend\r\nitself by pricking the venturesome fingers that have seized it. In\r\nother species this sting is represented sometimes by a kind of saw or\r\ncutlass, sometimes by a blade, more or less long and slender, hidden in\r\na fold of the stomach or else projecting and open to view. Well,\r\ninsects thus armed with a sting, a saw, or a blade, and having four\r\nmembranous wings as fine and transparent as those of the honey-bee, the\r\nbumblebee, and the wasp, are called hymenoptera. They form an order\r\njust as butterflies and moths form the order of lepidoptera, and\r\ninsects with sheaths protecting the lower pair of wings form the order\r\nof coleoptera.”\r\n\r\n“The grasshopper,” Jules observed, “has a kind of sword on the end of\r\nits body, but it hasn’t the bee’s fine, transparent wings.”\r\n\r\n“Therefore it is not one of the hymenoptera.”\r\n\r\n“The grasshopper doesn’t hurt any one with its sword, does it?” asked\r\nEmile.\r\n\r\n“No; it uses this tool simply for placing its eggs in the ground where\r\nthey are to hatch. It is a sort of conveyor for the eggs, and is called\r\na terebra. The saw, the blade, the cutlass, and other like implements\r\nthat terminate the body of various insects have also this name. They\r\nserve to deposit the eggs in suitable places where the larvæ can find\r\nfood. But this implement, dangerous though it looks, never stings when\r\nthe insect is molested; it is not a defensive weapon. Only the\r\nhoney-bee, the bumblebee, the wasp, and some others have for their\r\ndefense a sting that inflicts a painful wound.”\r\n\r\n“So painful,” Emile interrupted, “that I still remember how once, when\r\nI wanted to see what was going on in the beehive, I was stung by the\r\nbees.”\r\n\r\n“The wasp’s sting is much worse,” remarked Louis. “When I was gathering\r\nthe grapes last year I took hold of a bunch where there were some\r\nwasps, and my hand was swollen all day and pained me so I should have\r\ncried if there had been nobody around.”\r\n\r\n“How wonderful that such small creatures really hurt like that!” Jules\r\nexclaimed. “I should like to know why.”\r\n\r\n“I will tell you. The sting of these insects is a slender lancet, hard\r\nand sharp-pointed, a kind of dagger finer than the finest needle. It is\r\nsituated at the end of the abdomen. In repose it is not seen, being\r\nconcealed in a sort of scabbard let into the creature’s body; but in\r\ntime of danger it comes out of this scabbard. Now, it is not exactly\r\nthe wound made by the sting that causes the smarting pain you know so\r\nwell. This wound is so slight, so subtle, that we cannot see it, and we\r\nshould hardly feel it if it were made by a needle or a thorn as fine as\r\nthe sting. But the sting communicates with a venom-sac lodged in the\r\ninsect’s body, and through a tiny channel running the length of the\r\nsting there is injected into the very heart of the wound a minute\r\nquantity of a highly dangerous liquid. After this injection the sting\r\nis withdrawn, while the venom remains in the wound; and that is what\r\ncauses the pain.\r\n\r\n“Learned men who have studied this curious subject relate the following\r\nexperiment, which was performed in order to prove that it is the\r\nvenomous liquid introduced into the wound, and not the wound itself,\r\nthat causes the pain. When one pricks oneself with a very fine needle\r\nthe pain is of no consequence and passes almost immediately. Well, the\r\nprick of a needle, insignificant in itself, can be made very painful\r\nindeed if the little wound is poisoned with venom from a bee or a wasp.\r\nThe learned men I just spoke of dipped the point of a needle into the\r\nbee’s venom-sac and with the needle thus moistened lightly pricked\r\nthemselves. The pain that followed was severe and protracted, even\r\nseverer and of longer duration than if the insect itself had stung the\r\nexperimenters. This difference is to be explained by the fact that the\r\nneedle, large in comparison with the insect’s sting, introduced into\r\nthe wound much more venom than the sting itself could have conveyed.\r\nNow you understand, I hope, that it is the injection of the venom into\r\nthe wound that causes all the mischief.”\r\n\r\n“That is plain enough,” assented Jules.\r\n\r\n“The bee’s sting is barbed,” continued Uncle Paul; “that is to say, it\r\nis furnished with teeth somewhat like those of a saw and pointing\r\nbackward. In its haste to fly away after stinging, the bee does not\r\nalways succeed, on account of these teeth, in drawing out the sting\r\nfrom the wound it has inflicted; and thus the sting is wrenched from\r\nthe bee’s body, to the endangering of the insect’s life. The venom-sac\r\nis left behind also; it is that little white globule one sees outside\r\nthe wound and at the base of the sting. If the person stung, hastening\r\nto extract the sting, is awkward enough to press on the little sac, a\r\ngreat part of the venom is likely to be injected into the wound, with a\r\ncorresponding increase of pain. This is a warning to you, whenever you\r\nare stung by a bee, to draw out the sting cautiously and to be careful\r\nnot to press on the venom-sac.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII\r\n\r\nBENEFICENT PARASITES\r\n\r\n\r\nContinuing the subject of the day before, Uncle Paul laid emphasis on\r\nthe distinction between those hymenopterous insects that sting and\r\nthose that do not.\r\n\r\n“At the end of the abdomen,” said he, “the one class have a poisoned\r\nweapon for self-defense, as in bees and wasps, while the other class\r\nare furnished simply with the implement called a terebra, sometimes\r\nconcealed in a fold of the skin, sometimes standing out in full view,\r\nand used, not for stinging, but for introducing the creature’s eggs\r\ninto such places as will provide the nourishment required by the future\r\nbrood. Insects of this latter class are called by the general name of\r\nichneumons. This morning Emile caught one, which I will show you.”\r\n\r\n“I found it on a flower,” said Emile, “and I wrapped a handkerchief\r\nround my hand for fear of being stung. The thing it has sticking out at\r\nthe end of its body looks rather dangerous.”\r\n\r\n“The precaution was needless,” his uncle assured him. “No ichneumon,\r\nhowever long its terebra may be, can sting your hand. The hymenopters\r\nthat are to be feared have their sting hidden, and they bring it out\r\nonly at the moment of attack.”\r\n\r\n“Those three thread-like things as long as the insect’s body—what are\r\nthey for?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“The two lateral ones unite and form a scabbard for holding and\r\nprotecting the middle one, the most important of the three, for it is\r\nused to deposit the eggs at the point chosen as suitable by the\r\ninsect.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve seen ichneumons very much like this one,” said Louis, “with the\r\nterebra stuck right into the thick bark of a poplar. They must have\r\nbeen laying their eggs in the wood under the bark.”\r\n\r\n“No, they were doing something better than that. The larvæ of\r\nichneumons live in the bodies of other larvæ, which they devour little\r\nby little without killing them until the very last. They are\r\ncarnivorous larvæ: they must have fresh meat that is renewed about as\r\nfast as they eat it. The ichneumons Louis speaks of were engaged in\r\ndepositing their eggs in the bodies of plump worms that live in the\r\nwood of the tree and turn into beetles.”\r\n\r\n“But these beetle-worms,” Jules pointed out, “were not in sight. They\r\nwere under the bark and perhaps in the wood itself.”\r\n\r\n“The ichneumon does not need to see them to know where they are.”\r\n\r\n“Does it hear them then?”\r\n\r\n“No more than it sees them. The worm stays quietly in its little\r\ntunnel, being careful not to make any noise that will attract the\r\nattention of its enemy.”\r\n\r\n“Then the ichneumon must at least smell them.”\r\n\r\n“That is very doubtful. A live larva has no odor. And, besides, the\r\nmost difficult part is not to find out whether or not a suitably plump\r\nlarva is there under the bark, at such and such a depth; it is also\r\nnecessary to ascertain whether another ichneumon egg has not already\r\nbeen laid in the body of the coveted worm, as one larva would be\r\ninsufficient for two nurslings. An egg deposited in some fat worm is\r\nnot seen, heard, or felt; that is very evident. Nevertheless the\r\nichneumon never plunges its terebra through the bark into a larva\r\nalready occupied. What guides it? I do not know; nobody knows. Instinct\r\nhas ways and means unsuspected by our wisdom. An ichneumon alights on\r\nthe trunk of a tree. The perfectly healthy bark betrays to the sharpest\r\neyes no sign of what the hymenopter is after. Never mind; the insect\r\nsoon satisfies itself as to whether or not the place is a good one for\r\nits purpose. It makes a careful examination, tapping with its antennæ\r\nand keeping up a continual vibratory movement. A spot is chosen. The\r\ninsect plants itself firmly on its legs, draws up its abdomen, and,\r\nholding its terebra in a vertical position, plunges the point of it\r\ninto an imperceptible fissure in the bark. The little auger pierces the\r\nbark, though not without effort and occasional pauses, for there are\r\ndifficulties to be overcome; nevertheless it goes as far as its length\r\npermits. The end is attained; the point of the instrument penetrates\r\nthe flesh of the worm hidden under the bark. The egg being deposited in\r\nthe incision thus made, the insect withdraws its blade carefully, so as\r\nnot to break it, and proceeds to lay eggs in the bodies of other\r\nlarvæ.”\r\n\r\n“Then the great length of this blade,” Jules remarked, “though at first\r\nit seems unhandy for the creature, is on the contrary perfectly fitted\r\nfor the work to be done. With too short a terebra the ichneumon\r\ncouldn’t reach the larvæ under the bark and even in the wood itself.”\r\n\r\n“From the length of the terebra one can estimate at what depth, as a\r\nrule, the eggs are laid. Ichneumons with a long terebra lay their eggs\r\nin larvæ protected by a thick layer of bark or wood or earth or other\r\nmaterial; those with a short terebra seek larvæ living in the open air,\r\nsuch as caterpillars for example. However, if the caterpillar is\r\ncovered with long hairs, thus keeping the ichneumon at a distance from\r\nthe skin of its victim, a long implement is still necessary to convey\r\nthe eggs into the flesh. But for smooth-skinned caterpillars without\r\nany defense the ichneumon is furnished with a very short terebra, often\r\ninvisible when not in action, so that the end of the insect’s abdomen\r\nmust be pressed in order to make the egg-conveyer show itself, be it\r\nlancet, saw, fine blade, or other instrument of that sort.\r\n\r\n“The ichneumon on the hunt is one of the most curious sights\r\nimaginable. Caterpillars are peacefully browsing on leaves. An\r\nichneumon comes along, flies about over them, selects the ones that\r\nlook best for its purpose, and never fails to exclude those that\r\nalready have eggs in their bodies. At the sound of their enemy’s wings\r\nthe terrified caterpillars stop eating and begin to move their heads in\r\na startled manner from side to side, doubtless in the hope of\r\nfrightening off the foe. But the latter pays no attention to these vain\r\nthreats; it alights on the caterpillar of its choice and, so quickly\r\nthat you hardly have time to see the operation, darts its terebra and\r\nlays an egg in the wound.”\r\n\r\n“And doesn’t the caterpillar make any resistance?” asked Emile.\r\n\r\n“It performs some lively antics, but that is all. The poor creature\r\ncannot defend itself against an enemy in the air, a winged enemy that\r\ncan always keep at a safe distance and is always ready to fly away. The\r\nother eligible caterpillars in the group are attacked in the same\r\nmanner, one by one, until the ichneumon has laid all its eggs.”\r\n\r\n“Each caterpillar gets only one egg?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“That depends on the size of the egg-layer. If it is large it lays but\r\none egg in each caterpillar, so that the larvæ may each have enough\r\nfood; if small, it lays several.”\r\n\r\n“And then what happens?” Emile inquired.\r\n\r\n“The ichneumon gone, the pricked caterpillars soon recover their\r\ncomposure and resume their eating. The prick, not being poisoned with\r\nvenom, causes very little pain; besides, it would take a good deal more\r\nthan that to affect their appetites. All goes well for a few days, as\r\nlong as the eggs are unhatched.”\r\n\r\n“Do those eggs hatch in the caterpillar’s body?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And as soon as they have hatched do the little larvæ set to work\r\ndevouring the caterpillar’s inside?”\r\n\r\n“That’s the way of it.”\r\n\r\n“What an awful stomach-ache for the poor caterpillars!”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, even with such pain as may result from the gradual\r\nconsumption of their flesh, the caterpillars continue to eat as if\r\nnothing had happened, the satisfaction of their appetite making them\r\nforget their sufferings, so imperious is their need of food. And\r\nfurthermore, for a reason that I will explain, the parasitic worms\r\nobserve a certain caution in their ravages.\r\n\r\n“In the body of every animal are certain organs more indispensable than\r\nothers for the maintenance of life, and if they are injured, even\r\nthough slightly, death follows. Such are the heart and brain in the\r\nhigher animals. In a caterpillar’s body there are, it is true, no heart\r\nor brain like those of animals higher in the scale; but there are\r\nanalogous organs just as necessary to the ongoing of the vital\r\nfunctions. If the ichneumon’s larvæ, in eating their victim’s flesh,\r\nwere to injure these vital organs, the caterpillar would quickly die,\r\nand the larvæ would perish too, for they must have fresh meat, not\r\ndecayed flesh. It is a question of life or death to them whether the\r\ngrubs avoid biting in the wrong place or not. The caterpillar must live\r\nin order that they may live; it must prolong its miserable existence\r\nuntil they are ready for their metamorphosis. So the little parasites\r\nscrupulously respect any organ indispensable to the maintenance of life\r\nand feed on the rest; guided by instinct, they distinguish admirably\r\nbetween what they may attack and what they must let alone. A time\r\ncomes, however, when because of their approaching transformation they\r\ndo not need to exercise further self-restraint, and they accordingly\r\ndevour the parts until then left intact. Thereupon the caterpillar\r\ndies, being reduced to an empty skin which the larvæ promptly abandon\r\nin order to spin their cocoons and turn into nymphs and finally into\r\nichneumons.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes the caterpillar is spared until it has shut itself up in a\r\ncase and turned into a chrysalis, with the result that the larvæ\r\ninhabiting the caterpillar find themselves, without any labor on their\r\npart, provided with snug quarters for the winter. Out of every such\r\nwormy chrysalis, consumed to the skin, there emerges in the spring, not\r\na butterfly, but a swarm of ichneumons.”\r\n\r\n“Last autumn,” said Jules, “I found in the garden a large brown cocoon,\r\nand I hoped to see a beautiful butterfly come out of it; but this\r\nspring, to my great astonishment, out came a swarm of little flies.”\r\n\r\n“What you took for flies was a brood of ichneumons. Yet there are\r\nflies, real flies, that lay their eggs in the bodies of caterpillars,\r\njust as the hymenopterous butterflies do with their terebra.”\r\n\r\n“With their strange way of living on other creatures,” observed Louis,\r\n“ichneumons must destroy lots of caterpillars.”\r\n\r\n“They destroy so many that often, if you take a hundred caterpillars\r\nhaphazard from cabbages or other growing vegetables, you will find not\r\nmore than two or three that are sound and in a condition to undergo\r\nmetamorphosis.”\r\n\r\n“Can those that have eggs in them be told from the rest?” asked Louis.\r\n\r\n“Easily. The point pierced by the ichneumon’s terebra is surrounded by\r\na little black spot. When you are gathering caterpillars it is well not\r\nto crush those that you see are pricked, nor yet those that look\r\ndiseased and have a loose skin. They are ichneumon-feeders, and their\r\npreservation means so many more swarms of ichneumons the next summer\r\nfor the destruction of caterpillars.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX\r\n\r\nAPPLE-EATERS\r\n\r\n\r\n“Please tell us about the worm we find in apples and pears,” was\r\nLouis’s request one day when the children were gathered about their\r\nuncle.\r\n\r\n“That worm, my lad,” he began, “as I have already briefly explained, is\r\nthe grub or larva of a small moth.”\r\n\r\n“Seems to me,” interrupted Jules, “the moth is responsible for a good\r\ndeal of mischief.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, moths do more harm than any other insects; but not as moths, for\r\nthese never give us any cause for complaint, being content to suck a\r\nlittle honey through their slender trumpet from the flowers growing on\r\nevery side. It is in the larva state, with appetites of the most varied\r\nsort, that they commit their ravages. I have already told you about\r\nworms that gnaw wood and those that eat woolen stuffs, those that\r\nbrowse the foliage and those that attack roots. Now we come to some\r\nthat give their attention to fruit.\r\n\r\n“The best-known of these is the worm that lives in apples and pears. We\r\nusually call it the apple-worm, and its moth is known as the\r\napple-pyralis. The term pyralis is new to you; it comes from a Greek\r\nword meaning fire, and was long ago ignorantly applied to the\r\napple-moth because that insect was supposed to eat fire as its regular\r\ndiet. Its forward wings are ash-gray streaked crosswise with brown and\r\nornamented at the tip with a large red spot encircled by a golden-red\r\nborder. The rear wings are brown. When the fruit is just beginning to\r\nform, the pyralis lays an egg in the blossom end of apple or pear, no\r\nmatter which, and the little worm that soon comes from this egg takes\r\nup its abode close to the seeds. The narrow channel by which it entered\r\nskins over so that the wormy fruit appears intact for some time.\r\nMeanwhile the worm is living in the lap of luxury, with an abundance of\r\nits favorite food all around; but it must have a passage communicating\r\nwith the outside so as to get air and make the abode sanitary,\r\nencumbered as it is with refuse and excrement. Accordingly the worm\r\nbores a little tunnel through the flesh of the fruit to the skin and\r\nthrough this also; there the tunnel ends in a round hole. Through this\r\npassageway the larva receives fresh air and throws out from time to\r\ntime the chewed and digested pulp, in the form familiar to us as\r\nreddish wormhole dust. The translucent quality of its skin causes the\r\nworm to vary in hue according to the color of what it eats, being\r\nsometimes white, sometimes brown or yellow, and sometimes pink. It is\r\nornamented with little black tubercles or pimples arranged in pairs.\r\nThe head and the first ring-like section of the body are brown.\r\n\r\n“Apples and pears containing worms continue to grow; indeed, they ripen\r\nsooner than the others, but it is a sickly maturity that hastens the\r\nfall of the fruit. As a rule, the larva in wormy fruit that has fallen\r\nto the ground is by that time fully grown; accordingly, it leaves its\r\ndomicile by the passage already made and creeps into some crevice in\r\nthe bark of a tree, or sometimes it retires underground, after which it\r\nmakes for itself a shell of silk mixed with fragments of wood or dead\r\nleaves, and turns into a moth the next year, when all the young apples\r\nand pears are ready to receive its eggs for the new generation.\r\n\r\n“In plums and apricots is found a worm closely resembling that\r\ninfesting apples and pears; another occurs in chestnuts, and a third in\r\npea-pods, the tender young peas furnishing excellent food for the\r\nintruder. All these worms are the larvæ of moths commonly named from\r\nthe fruit or vegetable they infest. The pea-worm, after it has devoured\r\nthe best part of the pod’s contents, passes into another pod by boring\r\na round hole. Its moth appears in June, and the larva in July and\r\nAugust. Consequently, spring peas are never wormy, while those of late\r\nsummer very often are. This example shows you how, in certain\r\ninstances, a crop can be saved by hastening or delaying the sowing,\r\naccording to the time when the ravagers may be expected to appear.”\r\n\r\n“But no such plan can be carried out with chestnuts,” said Emile. “That\r\nis plain enough, for chestnut-trees bear their nuts at a fixed time,\r\nand we can’t hurry them up or keep them back. The chestnut-moth comes\r\njust when the table is set for its young ones. What disgusting-looking\r\nworms they are, too—all red and soaked in their own juice in the\r\nchestnut-meat!”\r\n\r\n“We can’t do anything, either, for the apple-trees and the pear-trees,\r\ncan we?” Louis inquired.\r\n\r\n“Not much. Some people gather the wormy apples and pears fallen from or\r\nstill on the trees, and crush them to kill the worms inside. That makes\r\nso many enemies the fewer for the following year; but again it has to\r\nbe admitted that, left to our own resources, we could never defend\r\nourselves against the pyralis and other similar moths that produce\r\nlarvæ from which hardly anything is safe. Fortunately the swallow\r\ncatches these moths on the wing, bats chase them assiduously in the\r\ntwilight, and the little gray lizard snaps them up when they alight on\r\nthe trunks of trees. These are so many friends, protectors of our\r\ngardens and orchards.”\r\n\r\n“The moths you call by that queer name, pyralis—are there a good many\r\nof them?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“There are numerous species, and each species is represented by\r\ncountless legions of individual moths. Some of these attack fruit; I\r\nhave just told you about the principal ones. Others have a different\r\nmode of life, and of these I will speak to-morrow. But they are all\r\nvery small moths, and some are beautifully colored. Their antennæ are\r\nfine and their wings, rounding at the shoulders, spread out in the form\r\nof a cape and are folded together in repose like the two halves of a\r\nsloping roof; that is, they incline to right and left. Their grubs have\r\na smooth and shiny skin. These worms draw back quickly when molested\r\nand let themselves fall to the ground, deadening the shock of the fall\r\nby means of a silk thread that holds them suspended by the lip.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a clever trick,” Emile observed. “As soon as the worm is\r\nfrightened it glues the end of the thread to something and down it\r\ndrops, but gently and only as fast as the thread is let out by the\r\nspinneret.”\r\n\r\n“This morning,” said Jules, “Mother Ambroisine was picking over some\r\ndried peas. A few were pierced with a round hole, and others had a\r\nlittle brown insect spotted with white. Peas, then, have two enemies:\r\nthe pyralis-worm that eats fresh fruit and the insect I am speaking of\r\nthat eats them dry.”\r\n\r\n“The insect that eats dried peas is a small beetle, a weevil with a\r\nwide and very short snout. It is known as the pea-weevil. Another\r\nweevil eats beans, and still another lentils. It is always the larva\r\nthat does the mischief. Once arrived at the perfect state, the weevil\r\nbores a round hole in the seed and gets out. These weevils have the\r\nsame habits as the grain-weevil. They are destroyed by the use of\r\nsulphide of carbon, or simply by the action of heat if the seeds they\r\ninfest are not to be sown, for the temperature required to kill the\r\ninsects and their larvæ would also destroy the germinative principle of\r\nthe seed.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L\r\n\r\nLEAF-ROLLERS\r\n\r\n\r\n“Many of the moths bearing the name of pyralis have a curious habit in\r\ntheir larva state, of rolling up the leaves of trees, or of folding\r\nthem lengthwise, or of uniting several in the form of a sheath by means\r\nof silk threads, so as to make a shelter in which they may nibble away\r\nin safety at the interior of their green abode. For this reason they\r\nare called leaf-rollers. The one best known, on account of the damage\r\nit does, is the grapevine-pyralis.\r\n\r\n“It is a small moth with yellow wings having the metallic sheen of\r\ncopper and crossed by brown stripes. Its larva is greenish, bristling\r\nwith short hairs and having a head of a dark lustrous green color. In\r\nAugust the moth lays its eggs on the vine leaves in little slabs of\r\ntwenty at most. Hatching takes place in September. At this advanced\r\nseason of the year caterpillars do not eat; they suspend themselves by\r\na thread and wait for the wind to drive them against the vine or one of\r\nits supports. As soon as they get a foothold on the desired object they\r\ntake refuge in cracks in the bark and fissures in the wood, and there\r\nthey lie torpid through the winter. At the reawakening of vegetable\r\nlife and the first pushing forth of the new vine shoots they leave\r\ntheir winter quarters, invade the vines, and entwine with silk threads\r\nthe young grape clusters and the tender leaves, after which they feed\r\nupon them with an appetite sharpened by a fast of five or six months.\r\nWith such ravenous eaters devastation proceeds apace, and in a few\r\nweeks, if the worms are numerous, the most flourishing vine is reduced\r\nto a pitiful condition and all hope of a harvest is abandoned. The\r\nravages wrought by this moth between 1835 and 1840 in the vineyards of\r\nBourgogne will long be remembered. Over immense tracts of land, when\r\nvintage-time came, there was not a single bunch of grapes to go into\r\nthe basket. The greedy caterpillars ruined the country.”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t the people try to get rid of the creatures?” asked Louis.\r\n\r\n“They tried various methods, but with little success until finally one\r\nproved effective, and that the simplest and cheapest of all. Let us\r\nnote by the way, my little friends, what an advantage it is to be\r\nacquainted with the habits of an insect that does us harm. If this\r\nmoth’s peculiarities had not been studied, if it had not been known\r\nthat its larvæ hide themselves in the fissures of the vines and the\r\ntrellises, there to lie torpid all winter, our vineyards might still be\r\nsuffering from this terrible enemy. This fact being known, the remedy\r\nwas not far to seek.\r\n\r\n“It is this: in winter the vines and trellises are scalded with boiling\r\nwater, the water being heated over a fire in the middle of the\r\nvineyard. “With a coffee-pot about a liter of hot water is poured on\r\neach vine so as to reach all the parts where worms may be lurking.\r\nProtected by its tough bark, the vine itself does not suffer from this\r\nscalding bath, while the caterpillars are completely destroyed. By this\r\nmethod the vineyards of Bourgogne were so entirely rid of the dreaded\r\nmoth that no further ravages of any account have been reported.”\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t the moths come back again some time, as many as ever?” asked\r\nJules.\r\n\r\n“That is hardly possible if at their first appearance the coffee-pot of\r\nhot water is brought into play.\r\n\r\n“The other leaf-rolling moths of this family are of less importance.\r\nThe leaf-roller of the plum-tree lives first on the blossoms of the\r\ntree; later it makes a roll of leaves and lines it with silk. The moth\r\nhas a large white spot at the tip of each fore wing.\r\n\r\n“The cherry-tree leaf-roller has about the same habits. Its moth is\r\nrecognized by two wide oblique stripes of the color of rust on its fore\r\nwings. On the pear-tree lives a leaf-roller with a triangular white\r\nspot in the middle of each fore wing.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t remember ever having seen the moths you are telling us about,”\r\nsaid Jules.\r\n\r\n“They are too small to be noticed by any one who is not on the lookout\r\nfor them.”\r\n\r\n“I have often seen the nests of leaf-rolling caterpillars on\r\nfruit-trees and bushes and all sorts of plants. There are leaves folded\r\nlengthwise so that the edges join and make a sort of tunnel; others are\r\nin twos or threes or more; and there are some fastened together in a\r\nbig bunch, all twisted and ragged, with silk threads holding them\r\ntogether. On opening these nests of leaves and silk I have sometimes\r\nfound a caterpillar and sometimes a spider.”\r\n\r\n“Various spiders with too little silk to spin a large web for catching\r\nflies make an ambush by bringing the edges of two or three adjacent\r\nleaves together. Like the leaf-rolling caterpillars they use silk\r\nthreads to hold the pieces of their abode in place, but their ultimate\r\nobject is quite different. The rollers bring the leaves together so as\r\nto nibble them in peace, safely hidden away in the shelter thus formed;\r\nthe spiders bring them together to make a simple abode for themselves\r\nand an ambush from which they can pounce upon such insects as come\r\nwithin their reach.”\r\n\r\n“The spiders that make a nest of leaves joined together do not harm\r\ntrees?”\r\n\r\n“I should rather say they are helpful to trees. They are vigilant\r\nguardians, always on the watch for flies, gnats, little moths, and\r\nother ravagers that would come and infest the trees with their eggs.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI\r\n\r\nTHE HOP-MOTH\r\n\r\n\r\n“What is that pretty butterfly in your box, next to the pyralis?” Emile\r\nasked his uncle when the latter was showing the children some of his\r\nspecimens of moths and butterflies. “It has silver wings bordered with\r\nred.”\r\n\r\n“That is not a butterfly, my boy,” replied Uncle Paul; “it is a moth\r\nthat infests hop-vines.”\r\n\r\n“Are hops those things they make beer with?”\r\n\r\n“Beer is not made from hops, my boy; it is made from barley. First the\r\nbarley is slightly moistened, after which it is kept at a mild\r\ntemperature. The grain begins to sprout just as it would do if sown in\r\nthe field. For the nourishment of the little plants, which have no\r\nroots as yet, a special food already prepared is needed, just as the\r\nyoung kitten, not yet big enough to catch mice, needs its mother’s\r\nmilk. All grain, in beginning to grow, whether it be wheat or oats or\r\nrye or any other, requires a special form of nourishment, ready\r\nprepared. But where do you suppose it is to be found? You hadn’t\r\nthought of that. I will tell you. The grain has it in itself. In a\r\nkernel of barley or wheat or oats or rye there is a white substance\r\nwhich, when ground to powder, is known as flour.”\r\n\r\n“Then the sprouting plant feeds on flour?”\r\n\r\n“Not exactly; flour is too coarse a food for it. The little plant takes\r\nits nourishment much as we do when we are very small. It sucks up water\r\nholding in solution the substances needed for its growth. But flour\r\nwill not dissolve in water, as you very well know; consequently, the\r\nlittle plant would die of hunger right beside its store of provision if\r\nthe flour were not prepared for it—I might say, cooked for it—in a way\r\nsuited to its needs.”\r\n\r\n“That must be a funny arrangement—food cooked for a plant!”\r\n\r\n“It is more wonderful than you can imagine. As the sprout pushes upward\r\nthe flour in the grain is being turned to sugar, real sugar, very sweet\r\nand easily dissolved in water; so that the young plant has for its\r\nnourishment a sufficient supply of sweetened water or, to express it in\r\nanother way, a sort of milk.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes!” cried Emile. “Now I understand. Last Christmas Mother\r\nAmbroisine put some wheat to sprout in a plate and kept it moist on the\r\nmantelpiece. When the little blades began to show, the wheat was all\r\nsoft and would crush under your fingers; and it gave out a sort of very\r\nsweet milk.”\r\n\r\n“This wonderful transformation of flour into sugar during germination\r\nis turned to account by man in making beer. He causes barley to\r\ngerminate, and when he judges that all the flour substance it contains\r\nhas turned to sugar he quickly kills the little plants, as otherwise\r\nthe sweetened liquid would be taken up by them and would undergo\r\nanother transformation by being turned into plant substance.\r\nAccordingly, the grain is promptly dried in an oven, after which it is\r\nground in a mill, and this ground barley is called malt. By adding\r\nwater and keeping it at a mild temperature we induce a fresh change:\r\nthe sugar turns to alcohol, which is the essential element of beer and\r\nwine.”\r\n\r\n“The flour of the grain, then,” said Jules, “turns to sugar or to plant\r\nsubstance or to alcohol, according to the way it is treated; is that\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and it can be converted into many other things. Boiled with water\r\nit becomes paste. After entering into the composition of beer it can be\r\nturned into vinegar by being left exposed to the air and allowed to\r\nsour. But we will not now dwell on these various changes. Let us return\r\nto the subject of beer. In order to impart to that beverage the bitter\r\ntaste and the aroma peculiar to it, we use hops. Barley is the\r\nfundamental ingredient of the drink, hops are the flavoring.\r\n\r\n“The hop-plant is a long, slender vine unable to hold itself up without\r\nsupporting poles, around which it twines to the height of perhaps ten\r\nmeters. Its leaves are lobed somewhat like those of the grape, and its\r\nfruit takes the shape of cones or catkins similar to those of the\r\npine-tree, but much smaller and composed of thin scales coated with a\r\nsort of bitter resin. It is these cones that are used in making beer.\r\nHops are extensively cultivated in Alsace and in Germany. The chief\r\nenemies of the hop-vine are two worms, one of which nibbles the roots\r\nand the other the inside of the stem or vine.\r\n\r\n“The epialidæ are distinguished from all other moths by their very\r\nshort antennæ. Their larvæ live in the ground and feed on roots. The\r\nmost important member of this family is the hop-moth, of which the male\r\nhas white wings touched with silver and edged with a reddish border,\r\nand the female has fore wings of bright yellow with tawny edges and two\r\ntawny oblique stripes. The grub is whitish, covered with little yellow\r\ntubercles overgrown with black hair. It does great damage to hop\r\nplantations by gnawing the roots. To destroy it the hop-grower is\r\nadvised to spray the base of the vine with water in which hog-manure\r\nhas been left to steep—an application that is said to kill the worms.\r\n\r\n“Within the stem of the plant lives the grub of the pyralis that I show\r\nyou here. The moth has dark-yellow fore wings edged with a scalloped\r\nstripe of a lighter shade and marked with a number of red spots. The\r\nhind wings are white with purple spots and yellowish edges.”\r\n\r\n“Alongside of that moth there are two more in your box,” Emile pointed\r\nout.\r\n\r\n“They are the madder-moth and the woad-moth. Madder used to be\r\ncultivated for its root, which yields a red dye, the most beautiful and\r\nlasting of all red dyes.”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t Mother Ambroisine’s Sunday kerchief dyed with madder?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; and with the red there are black, pink, garnet, and violet on the\r\nkerchief, all obtained from madder. In the methods formerly in use\r\nvarious drugs were first applied to the goods to be dyed, this being\r\ndone by means of wooden blocks engraved with the desired patterns,\r\nafter which a bath of boiling water containing powdered madder root\r\nbrought out all the different colors, at once, their respective tints\r\ndepending on the drugs previously applied. These colors, of which there\r\nwere many varieties, had the great advantage of never fading in the sun\r\nand of resisting soap; hence madder used to be the most highly prized\r\nof dyestuffs and was a source of much profit to Alsace and the\r\ndepartment of Vaucluse, the only districts devoted to its culture. Its\r\ninsect foe was the moth I now show you. At weeding-time it was the\r\ncustom to destroy the caterpillars, which fed on the leaves of the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\n“Woad is another plant used in dyeing. Prepared in a certain way, the\r\ngreen matter of its leaves gives a fine blue color. The caterpillar of\r\na leaf-rolling moth eats first the woad leaves and then the stalk.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII\r\n\r\nTHE INCHWORM\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day Uncle Paul was in his garden engaged in an operation on his\r\npear-trees that greatly puzzled Emile and Jules. He had a pot of black,\r\nsticky stuff with a strong smell, and was smearing it with a brush all\r\naround the base of the trees. Oh, how One-eyed John would have laughed\r\nif he had peeped through the hedge and seen Uncle Paul daubing the foot\r\nof his pear-trees with black! But he would have been greatly in the\r\nwrong, as is proved by what the boys’ uncle said to them that same\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n“What do you call that stuff you were putting on the trees this\r\nmorning?” Jules inquired.\r\n\r\n“It is called tar, and is a substance derived from coal. To make\r\nilluminating gas coal is put into large cast-iron vessels and heated\r\nred-hot, all outside air being excluded meanwhile. The heat decomposes\r\nthe coal, which cannot burn for want of air. The products of this\r\ndecomposition are illuminating gas, tar, and coke, this last being a\r\nkind of coal of metallic appearance, very porous and light. The gas and\r\nthe tar are drawn off through a pipe, the coke remaining in the\r\ncast-iron vessel. Tar is a very black, sticky substance with a strong\r\nodor repugnant to insects.”\r\n\r\n“Then you put a coating of it around the tree trunks to keep off\r\ninsects?”\r\n\r\n“Certain moths whose caterpillars I fear came through my hedge. The\r\ngirdle of tar put on at the base of the trunk is to prevent their\r\nclimbing to the branches to lay their eggs. In that way I protect the\r\nfruit-trees from the caterpillars that a little later would destroy the\r\nfoliage.”\r\n\r\n“But moths can fly well enough, and your tar wouldn’t stop them. If\r\nthey can’t reach the branches by climbing the trunk they will fly up to\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“For a moth that flies, agreed. If on the contrary it cannot fly, but\r\nhas to content itself with walking, is it not true that the coating of\r\ntar encircling the foot of the tree trunk will prove an impassable\r\nobstacle? In the first place, the smell of tar is offensive to the\r\nmoth, and then if it ventures on the sticky girdle it will infallibly\r\nbecome entangled and die, stuck fast in the tar.”\r\n\r\n“That is plain,” assented Louis. “But are there any moths that can’t\r\nfly?”\r\n\r\n“There are.”\r\n\r\n“Are the lazy things afraid to use their wings?” asked Emile. “Perhaps\r\nthey think it’s too much trouble.”\r\n\r\n“How could they use them? They haven’t any to use, poor things.”\r\n\r\n“That accounts for it, then. Moths without wings!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my boy, moths without wings. You shall see some. This one is\r\ncalled by learned men phalæna geometra, which means geometer-moth You\r\nwill soon see why it is so named.”\r\n\r\n“But it has wings, magnificent ones, all dotted with brown spots on a\r\nyellowish background.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and I will add that the forward ones have dark stripes. Now what\r\ndo you think of this other moth?”\r\n\r\n“That ugly thing isn’t a moth.”\r\n\r\n“You judge by appearances, my dear child, and not by reality. This\r\nungainly creature laboriously dragging along its big, naked, yellowish\r\nabdomen, with large black spots, is the female of the other moth.”\r\n\r\n“I should never have guessed it.”\r\n\r\n“Neither you nor a great many others. Henceforth you will know that\r\nthere are numerous species of moths whose females are either wingless\r\nor equipped with such mere stumps of wings that they are unable to fly,\r\nwhereas the males invariably have well-developed wings. Now, the male\r\nis not the one to be feared; it is the female with her eggs. The office\r\nof the tar girdle at the foot of the tree is to arrest the moth when it\r\ntries to climb to the branches where the laying takes place. Repulsed\r\nby the odor, it turns back; or if it persists in its endeavors to pass,\r\nit sticks to the tar and so perishes.”\r\n\r\n“If the female laid her eggs somewhere else,” suggested Jules, “instead\r\nof on the branches—for instance, on the ground—wouldn’t the\r\ncaterpillars know enough to climb the trees by themselves?”\r\n\r\n“The tar barrier would still be there to stop them. Besides,\r\ncaterpillars hatched on the ground would hardly think of climbing the\r\ntree to the place where, in the usual order, the hatching would have\r\ntaken place. As long as the customary conditions remain unaltered,\r\ninsects show an astonishing instinct; beyond these conditions they do\r\nnot know how to act.\r\n\r\n“The caterpillar of the geometer-moth is gray with a yellow stripe\r\nrunning lengthwise on each side. It has a curious way of walking common\r\nto it and other caterpillars of the same group.\r\n\r\n“These caterpillars are long and cylindrical in shape, and they usually\r\nhave but two pairs of false legs, at some distance from the true front\r\nlegs. In walking they first rest themselves on the forward legs and\r\nthen bring up the others by curving the body into a loop or ring. The\r\nnext movement is to raise the forward legs and advance them in a stride\r\nas long as the creature itself, after which the body again bends into a\r\nloop by the bringing up of the hind legs as before. These peculiar\r\nstrides give the worm the appearance of a pair of dividers getting over\r\nthe ground by alternately opening and closing its two legs. You might\r\nsay the creature surveys or measures the road it travels, and that is\r\nwhy its moth is known as the geometer-moth. The common name of inchworm\r\napplied to the caterpillar is familiar to you as referring to the\r\ncaterpillar’s length.\r\n\r\n“Further characteristics are to be noted. Clinging to the branch solely\r\nby their hind creepers, these worms remain for hours in the strangest\r\npostures, the body stiff and motionless. You will see some stretched\r\nout straight, some turned up behind, some arched in a semicircular\r\nposition. Not one moves, not one shows weariness in these uncomfortable\r\nattitudes which demand an incredible amount of strength. You have\r\nwitnessed the feats of those strong-armed acrobats who, in the\r\nside-show at the fair, seize a vertical bar with both hands and without\r\nfurther support sustain themselves in the air, the body horizontal.\r\nInchworms do the same thing, but with this difference: whereas the\r\nacrobats are exhausted in a few moments, the caterpillars keep their\r\nbalance all day if necessary.”\r\n\r\n“Why do they do all those stunts?” was Emile’s question.\r\n\r\n“They are not doing stunts, as you call it; they are simply using their\r\nnatural means of escaping observation on the part of their enemies. By\r\nreason of their complete immobility, rigid posture, and grayish hue\r\nthey are confounded with the small dry twigs which they closely\r\nresemble. Unless examined at very short range they deceive all eyes,\r\neven those of birds, whose sight is so keen.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, the crafty rogues! To stiffen themselves and stay perfectly still\r\nso as to look like little dry twigs and in that way fool the birds that\r\nwould come and snap them up, is a very clever trick.”\r\n\r\n“The name of leaf-stripper, which is also given to this moth, indicates\r\nits way of living before it is transformed into the perfect insect. The\r\ncaterpillar gnaws the leaves of all fruit-trees without distinction,\r\nand even of other trees, such as oaks, birches, and lindens. For trees\r\nthat have not been smeared with a tar girdle to stop the moths at\r\nlaying time there is but one mode of defense left, and that is not\r\nnearly so good as the first: it is to shake the infested trees so as to\r\nmake the caterpillars fall, and then crush them.”\r\n\r\n“I prefer the tar girdle,” said Louis.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but it must be applied in time, in the autumn when the moths are\r\nabout to make their appearance.\r\n\r\n“Another moth of this group, sometimes called the winter moth, has fore\r\nwings of a grayish wine-color dotted with brown and striped crosswise\r\nin a darker shade. The female is a little better favored than that of\r\nthe one we have just been considering, having wings of a sort, but too\r\nrudimentary to admit of flying. It may be seen running over the ground\r\ntoward the end of autumn, when cold weather is approaching. Its tardy\r\nappearance has earned it the name of winter moth. Like the moth of the\r\ninchworm it climbs trees to lay its eggs, but can be prevented by the\r\nuse of tar on the trunk. Its eggs hatch in the spring, and the\r\ncaterpillars are full-grown by May. They are generally blackish, with\r\nwhite, yellow, or green stripes running lengthwise. On leaving the egg\r\nthese caterpillars bore the buds of pear, apple, apricot, and other\r\nfruit trees. Later they install themselves, one by one, between two\r\nleaves, the edges of which they unite with threads of silk.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII\r\n\r\nSAP-SUCKERS\r\n\r\n\r\n“What do plant-lice eat?” asked Jules one day. “I have never seen them\r\nfeeding on leaves.”\r\n\r\n“They do not feed on them,” his uncle replied; “they drink the sap\r\nthrough a very fine, short, pointed sucker which they carry against the\r\nbreast when not in use. The insect plunges it into the plant and for\r\nwhole days without moving drinks the sap at the point pricked. When\r\nthis place is sucked dry it passes to another, but without much change\r\nof position. The plant-louse is a sedentary creature; to move around a\r\nstem no bigger than your little finger is for the louse a long journey\r\nfraught with perils not lightly to be faced, a few steps forward to\r\nmake room in the rear for some fifty children as fast as they are\r\nbrought into the world being about all that the boldest of these\r\ncreatures dares to undertake. But plant-lice of the last generation of\r\nthe year have wings and lay eggs which in the spring renew the race\r\nannihilated by the cold of winter. These winged lice are no timid\r\nstay-at-homes like the others: they gladly quit the natal leaf to see a\r\nbit of the world. It is their business to travel hither and yon and lay\r\ntheir eggs in many places so that in the following spring all plants\r\nshall have their share of lice, and it is to fulfill this duty that\r\nthey are expressly provided with wings. Clouds of these traveling\r\nplant-lice, dense enough to obscure the light of day, have been\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n“Many other insects have, like the plant-louse, a straight, pointed\r\nsucker which they plunge into the substance they wish to drain of its\r\njuice, and which they hold against the breast when not in use. The\r\ncicada furnishes us a very good example, as do also the large bugs\r\nfound on trees and on many plants. The cabbage feeds two of them: the\r\nharlequin cabbage-bug, which is red with numerous black spots, and\r\nstill another cabbage-bug of a bluish-green color with white or red\r\nspots.\r\n\r\n“Bugs of this class have four wings, the upper pair covering the other\r\npair when in repose. The forward half of each upper wing is hard like\r\nthe beetle’s wing sheaths, but the other half is membranous and of fine\r\ntexture. This structure makes them half sheaths for protection and half\r\nwings for flying, and it is because of this peculiarity that insects of\r\nthis sort are called hemiptera, or half-winged creatures. The cicada is\r\na half-winged insect, as is also the plant-louse, although its upper\r\nwings (I am speaking of winged plant-lice, of course), instead of being\r\none half hard and the other half of a more delicate texture, have the\r\nsame fineness and transparency throughout. But the most striking\r\ncharacteristic of these insects, and the one that determines their mode\r\nof life, is the beak for sucking. So we will call hemiptera all insects\r\nequipped with a pointed sucker which lies against the breast when in\r\nrepose, and we will not concern ourselves with the question of wings,\r\nwhether half or entirely membranous.”\r\n\r\n“Do the hemiptera form an order by themselves?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“They form an order in the same way that coleoptera, lepidoptera,\r\nhymenoptera, diptera, and so on, form each an order. But hemiptera do\r\nnot undergo so thorough a transformation as other insects, being born\r\nwith very nearly the form they will always have. The chief change\r\nconsists in the growing of wings, which the insect does not have at\r\nfirst, but acquires later when it has attained sufficient size. In some\r\nspecies several generations succeed one another before the winged\r\nstate, which is the perfect one, is reached. Plant-lice belong to this\r\nclass, the earlier generations of the year having no wings, and only\r\nthe last being equipped with them.\r\n\r\n“A hemipterous insect with habits somewhat like those of the plant\r\nlouse causes considerable damage to pear-trees. It is commonly called\r\nthe flea-louse of the pear, and is a small reddish insect with\r\ndiaphanous wings that fold at an angle like the two sides of an\r\nacute-angled roof. It is found on pear-trees, and more rarely on\r\napple-trees, toward the end of April. The eggs are laid one by one in\r\nslight gashes made in the leafstem by the female with a little auger\r\nsituated at the end of the abdomen. The larvæ that come from these eggs\r\ngrow rapidly and differ from the perfect insect only in their lack of\r\nwings. By sloughing the skin these larvæ become nymphs, short and\r\nstubby and already having on each side a rudimentary wing. In its final\r\nform the insect acquires perfect wings. In all three of its successive\r\nstages the insect plunges its sucker into the tender bark, or into the\r\nleaves, and sucks the sap. The best way to destroy these creatures is\r\nto use a hard bristle brush on those parts of the bark where they are\r\nto be found in multitudes.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV\r\n\r\nQUEER MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nUncle Paul had placed in the lettuce bed two large pots half full of\r\nwater and set into the ground flush with the surface. He said they were\r\na trap for mole-crickets, which, from the withered appearance of some\r\nof the plants, he suspected were in the garden. One morning, on going\r\nto look into the pots, Emile found three drowned mole-crickets in them.\r\nThat evening Uncle Paul told the children about these creatures.\r\n\r\n“The insects Emile found in the trap,” said he, “are called\r\nmole-crickets from their habit of burrowing into the ground like moles\r\nand from their resembling in certain other ways ordinary crickets. The\r\nmole-cricket has the common cricket’s long and slender antennæ, its two\r\nflexible filaments at the end of the abdomen, and its rough wings which\r\nare rubbed against each other so as to make a sort of singing noise. It\r\nis a formidable ravager of our gardens.”\r\n\r\n“Do crickets really chirp with their wings?” asked Emile, in surprise.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my boy. In chirping the cricket raises its wings, which are dry\r\nand wrinkled, and rubs the edges together vigorously. The other\r\nchirping insects do about the same. The vineyard grasshopper, the one\r\nwith the large green and yellow belly, has on its back two round scales\r\nwhich fit together and rub against each other. They constitute its\r\nmusical instrument. Other grasshoppers play the violin; that is to say,\r\nthey scrape the rough edges of their wings with their big curved thighs\r\nas bows or fiddle-sticks. The cicada has under its stomach in a double\r\ncavity, protected by covers capable of being raised more or less, two\r\ndry and shiny membranes stretched as taut as drumheads. The insect\r\nsings by making these vibrate in their cases.”\r\n\r\n“Does the mole-cricket say cree-cree like the ordinary cricket?”\r\n\r\n“No; its song has a monotonous sound, being a sort of sharp buzzing,\r\nrather subdued, and continuous.”\r\n\r\n“And why does the mole-cricket sing? What an ugly creature with its\r\nlittle crafty eyes, short wings, big stomach, and frightful fore feet!”\r\n\r\n“It sings to cheer its solitude and call its mate. You think it ugly; I\r\nfind it admirably equipped for the work it has to do. It lives in the\r\nground, just as moles do, and like them it is provided with a special\r\ntool for digging in the earth and cutting the roots that bar its way.\r\nHave you ever noticed a mole’s fore feet? They are broadly\r\nshovel-shaped and furnished with strong claws. The mole-cricket’s fore\r\nfeet are very much like them, being short and wide and edged with\r\nsaw-teeth. With this pair of powerful tools the insect digs its\r\nsubterranean tunnels.”\r\n\r\n“Then that,” said Jules, “must be the reason for calling it a\r\nmole-cricket: it has the mole’s wide feet for digging.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to know,” Emile interposed, “what the mole and\r\nmole-cricket do under the ground.”\r\n\r\n“They hunt for worms and all kinds of insects for food. In their\r\nsubterranean operations both cut with their fore feet the roots that\r\nobstruct their progress, but the mole, exclusively carnivorous, does\r\nnot eat them, whereas the mole-cricket, living on both animal and\r\nvegetable matter, nibbles them at its pleasure. Nor does it disdain a\r\ntender lettuce leaf when at night it comes up above ground to get a\r\nlittle air and cultivate the acquaintance of its neighbors. Hence the\r\nmole-cricket does a great deal of damage in gardens by laying bare the\r\nroots of young plants when it is boring its tunnels, or by severing\r\nthese roots with the saw-like edges of its feet, or by nibbling them\r\nwhen hungry.\r\n\r\n“Not far beneath the surface of the ground the female makes her nest,\r\nwhich is in the form of a hollow ball of earth about as large as your\r\nfist. In this cavity, after it has been carefully smoothed and\r\nprepared, she lays her eggs, to the number of three or four hundred,\r\nafter which she remains in the neighborhood as if to watch over them.\r\nWhen first hatched the young ones are white all over and look like big\r\nants. When the ground is spaded these nests should always be destroyed.\r\n\r\n“The mole-cricket’s domain is composed of passages running down to a\r\ngreater or less distance, with hunting galleries just under the\r\nsurface. To dislodge the insect from its retreat a little oil is poured\r\ninto the hole where it is thought to have taken refuge, and then plenty\r\nof water from the watering-pot, until all the passages are inundated.\r\nThreatened with suffocation by the oil, which interferes with its\r\nbreathing, the mole-cricket soon comes to the surface. One can also use\r\nthe trap that I have found serviceable. A wide and deep vessel is set\r\ninto the ground, level with the surface, and half filled with water.\r\nAttracted by the coolness, the mole-crickets fall in and drown in the\r\ncourse of their nocturnal promenades. Sometimes, again, at the approach\r\nof cold weather holes are dug here and there and filled with horse\r\nmanure. The warmth of the manure is agreeable to the mole-crickets, and\r\nthey come and hide in it for the winter. When cold weather begins,\r\nthese lurking-places are searched and the foolish occupants destroyed.\r\n\r\n“The mole-cricket, the house-cricket, the locust, and the grasshopper\r\nbelong to a family of insects called orthoptera, so named from their\r\nstraight wings; that is, the lower wings, those used for flying, are\r\nfolded lengthwise in a straight line when in repose, like a closed fan.\r\nLook at the red or blue wings of the crickets that abound in autumn, in\r\ndry grass, and you will see them neatly folded lengthwise, while the\r\nupper wings, which are somewhat leathery, are usually brought together\r\nin the shape of a roof. Many, but not all, of the orthoptera have thick\r\nthighs ending in long and bristly legs that serve for jumping. Finally,\r\nsome of these insects have at the end of the abdomen a terebra,\r\ncommonly called a sword, its office being to lay the eggs in the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n“One of these orthoptera commits terrible ravages in Africa. It is the\r\nmigratory locust, so named because it assembles in immense swarms and\r\nmigrates to another region when food fails. The migrating swarm takes\r\nflight as at a given signal and moves through the air like a great\r\ncloud, even intercepting the light of the sun. Sooner or later the\r\ndevastating hordes swoop down like a living storm on the cultivated\r\nfields of some province, and in a few hours leaves, grain, pastures,\r\nfields, all are browsed bare as if swept by a conflagration, the ground\r\nshowing not a green blade of any kind surviving.”\r\n\r\n“If those ravenous locusts travel like that,” said Jules, “couldn’t\r\nthey come here?”\r\n\r\n“Driven by a favorable wind, clouds of locusts do sometimes cross the\r\nMediterranean and alight in our southern departments. At various times\r\nthe territory of Arles has suffered this terrible visitation. It should\r\nbe added that if the country suits them where they chance to alight,\r\nthe locusts lay their eggs there, and from these there springs a legion\r\nof devourers more numerous than the first. To lessen the ravages of\r\nthis second generation search is made for the eggs, which the locust\r\nlays in a cylindrical hole running a few centimeters into the ground.\r\nIn 1832, in the neighborhood of Arles, nearly four thousand kilograms\r\nof eggs were gathered besides bagfuls of the insects themselves. It\r\ntakes eighty thousand eggs to make a kilogram; hence in that harvest of\r\neggs there were three hundred and twenty million locusts destroyed\r\nbefore they were born. Imagine the ravages of such a swarm of devourers\r\nalighting on the vegetation of any given district. Before so terrible a\r\nscourge man bows his head and acknowledges his powerlessness, the\r\ninsect ravager overwhelming him by its very numbers.\r\n\r\n“How many other ravagers there are, my children, besides locusts, that\r\nby their inconceivable multitude defy our attempts to defend ourselves!\r\nYou are now in a position to realize somewhat the serious nature of\r\nthese devastations when you think of all the moths and caterpillars and\r\nworms, all the creeping and burrowing and flying insects, of all shapes\r\nand sizes and appetites, that attack our gardens and fields. They would\r\ncertainly gain the upper hand if we had to depend on ourselves in\r\ncombating them. But fortunately we are most ably assisted in this\r\ncontest.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See “Field, Forest, and Farm.”\r\n\r\n[2] See “The Story-Book of Science.”\r\n\r\n[3] The French campagnol is translated in this book by meadow-mouse.\r\nThe term vole, another rendering, is purely British and too\r\nuncommon in America to warrant its use in these pages.—Translator.\r\n\r\n[4] A name given to the cat in La Fontaine’s “Fables.”—Translator.\r\n\r\n[5] Audubon: “Ornithological Biography,” I. 160–162.—Translator.\r\n\r\n[6] Dupont de Nemours.\r\n\r\n[7] See “The Story-Book of Science.”\r\n\r\n[8] From “Le Crapaud” (“The Toad”), by Victor Hugo.—Translator.\r\n\r\n[9] A liter is slightly more than a quart, a hectoliter a little more\r\nthan one hundred quarts.—Translator.\r\n\r\n[10] See “The Secret of Everyday Things.”",
