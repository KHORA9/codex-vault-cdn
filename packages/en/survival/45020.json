I have no apology to make for presenting this\r\nsubject in a serious light. I regard it as one strictly in the domain\r\nof science, and, therefore, worthy of the consideration of scientific\r\nmen. I have no fear of ridicule, knowing for myself and \"not for\r\nanother,\" that what is here presented is the truth.\r\n\r\nTo those who seek absolute truth, I need not recommend a reading of\r\nthese pages. To those who merely live by science, drawing their\r\nsustenance from it as from the \"convenient cow,\" as Goethe says, I\r\nwill simply say, imprison yourselves, gentlemen, in your shell; the\r\nworld will move quite as well without you.\r\n\r\nI add a number of notes from various sources to which I had not access\r\nbefore writing my own experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT \"WATER-WITCHING.\"\r\n\r\n(WHAT I KNOW.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI have always observed that when any novelty is presented for the\r\nconsideration of man, which is not readily proven by already well\r\nknown scientific laws, or which may not be demonstrated by the\r\nknowledge and power of most persons, it is found extremely difficult,\r\nif not impossible, to gain the attention of the devotee of science.\r\nWhether, indeed, it be from lack of interest, from incredulity, or\r\nfrom the fear of ridicule, or from any other cause, we look with\r\ndistrust upon anything which is not in harmony with our preconceived\r\nideas or theories, and we are apt to raise the cry of humbug or\r\nsuperstition, and reject, with a contemptuous assumption of\r\nsuperiority as unbelievers, propositions which properly put to the\r\ntest might prove of value to mankind.\r\n\r\nHappily for us a wise Providence has not ordained that all minds shall\r\nplough in a single furrow of the great field of knowledge. Some,\r\ntherefore, believe nothing but what they see, and frequently doubt the\r\nevidence of their own senses. Others believe everything they see and\r\nnearly everything they hear, and seize with too great credulity upon\r\nevery new thing presented to them. There are others who disbelieve\r\nnothing that is presented to them, however apocryphal, without full\r\nand impartial investigation, aided not by testimony alone, but by\r\nactual demonstration. Again, there are men who are afraid to\r\ninvestigate, lest the world should call them visionary; these are\r\nalways prepared to apologize for examining anything outside the mere\r\nroutine of their special science. But the most frequent error of\r\nmankind is to doubt and ridicule, without investigation, everything\r\nwhich is not commonly received. To such I would cite the pungent words\r\nof Solomon: \"He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is a\r\nfolly and a shame unto him.\"\r\n\r\nI feel that I am speaking to those, who always listen with interest to\r\nevery proposition, and are willing to examine it, until its\r\ndemonstration is clear and its hidden mysteries revealed, and never\r\npronounce anything a superstition or an imposture, until from patient\r\nresearch they have a right, through their own experimental knowledge,\r\nto utter a verdict. But, lest there should be among us one of these\r\ndoubting Thomases or disbelieving cynics, I would appeal to him with\r\nthe history of the two Spanish students. These two young gentlemen,\r\nwhile traveling from Peñaflor to Salamanca, stopped at a spring to\r\nquench their thirst, and whilst seated upon the ground near the\r\nfountain observed something like a tombstone, level with the water;\r\nengraven on the stone were these words: \"Here lies interred the soul\r\nof Pedro Garcia.\" The youngest of the students, a thoughtless fellow,\r\nsaid, laughing loudly: \"What a joke. Here lies interred the soul! Who\r\never heard of a soul being buried? who can tell me the author of so\r\nridiculous an epitaph?\" The other, a reflective, judicious youth, said\r\nto himself: \"There is some mystery here, and I intend to solve it\r\nbefore I leave this spot.\" Letting his companion depart, without\r\nlosing a moment's time he took out his knife, cut around the stone,\r\ndug under it a little, and there found buried a purse containing one\r\nhundred ducats, with these words in Latin inscribed upon it: \"I\r\ndeclare thee my heir, whomsoe'er thou art, who hast had the genius to\r\nunderstand the meaning of the inscription; but I charge thee to use\r\nthis money better than I used it.\"\r\n\r\nNow to the point. The subject to which I am about to call your\r\nattention--that of finding water by means of the \"divining rod\"--is\r\none of those which in modern times is classed among mere\r\nsuperstitions, and as such unworthy of serious consideration by\r\nsensible people. I think I have it in my power to demonstrate to you,\r\nprincipally from my own personal experiences--the relation of which I\r\nbeg you to accept as strictly accurate--that this is an error on the\r\npart of the over-wise skeptics of our progressive epoch.\r\n\r\nWorcester's dictionary gives the following definition of the \"divining\r\nrod:--A forked branch, usually of hazel, said to be useful to discern\r\nmines and water.\" \"Witch-hazel--a tall shrub of eastern North America,\r\nremarkable for blossoming late in the autumn.\"\r\n\r\nAnother authority gives the following: \"Divining rod--A hazel twig cut\r\nin the form of a Y, by the aid of which certain persons (meaning, of\r\ncourse, sorcerers like myself,) called '_scientific_,' pretend to be\r\nable to discover water or mineral veins. The rod is held in a peculiar\r\nmanner, and the 'dowsers' walk backward and forward over the ground to\r\nbe tried. As soon as he crosses or approaches a metallic vein or\r\naqueous spring the twig turns toward it with a slow, rotary motion.\r\nThis superstition has not yet died out, and 'dowsers' are yet common\r\nin remote parts of England, France and Germany.\"\r\n\r\nNow, one can easily see that this writer is one of those who apologize\r\nfor seeming to believe a thing of the kind by calling it \"a\r\nsuperstition not yet died out.\"\r\n\r\nHere is another definition: \"Divining rod--A forked branch, usually of\r\nhazel, by which it has been pretended that minerals and water may be\r\ndiscovered in the earth. The rod, if slowly carried along in\r\nsuspension, dipping and pointing downwards, it is affirmed when\r\nbrought over the spot, where the concealed mine or spring is\r\nsituated.\"\r\n\r\nThe form, the material and the mode of using the divining rod of the\r\nmodern miners and water finders seem to be superstitions of\r\ncomparative recent introduction. Many persons with some pretensions to\r\nscience have been believers in the powers ascribed to the \"divining\r\nrod.\"\r\n\r\nHere we have another case of the apologetic historian. He dared not\r\nsay that he believed it, even though he had seen it. Why? Simply\r\nbecause there was no scientific fact or theory upon which he could\r\nbase his belief--so he was afraid even to say what he believed, lest\r\npeople who read his encyclopedia might say he was visionary.\r\n\r\nI read somewhere, a long time ago, that this superstition was also\r\nrife in the eleventh century. Now, like the young students above\r\ncited, some one among you may exclaim, \"Who will inform me who can be\r\nthe author of this ridiculous superstition?\" I wish I could tell you;\r\nI am sorry I can not, but I should not wonder if he lived before the\r\ndays of Moses, the first \"dowser\" on record. When oil was discovered\r\nin this country many of us believed that there was at last \"something\r\nnew under the sun.' We have only to turn to the Scriptures to learn\r\nthat Job was in the oil and dairy business a few thousand years before\r\nOil City sprung up under our wondering eyes. Job has always been\r\nsupposed to refer to some great miracle when he says, in the 29th\r\nchapter of his book, \"I washed my steps with butter and the rock\r\npoured me out rivers of oil; the young men saw me and hid themselves.\"\r\nAlso, in Deuteronomy, we read, chapter 32, verse 13, \"And he made him\r\nto suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock.\" Now,\r\nwe have these marvels repeating themselves daily; and I think it no\r\nvery far-fetched idea to assume that the \"divining rod\" was used in\r\nthe discovery of these precious deposits. I am myself acquainted with\r\na gentleman who has lately successfully located two oil wells by this\r\nmagic (so-called) process.\r\n\r\nIn fact, who knows but that the first knowledge of the \"divining rod\"\r\nwas a revelation, and that Moses not only understood the art, but\r\ntaught it to the Children of Israel, from whence the supposed\r\nsuperstition has spread.\r\n\r\nWhen Moses found the water at Meribeh-Rephidim and Meribeh-Kadesh, in\r\nthe wilderness of Zin, he had received the Almighty's command: \"Go\r\nbefore the people and take with thee the elders of Israel, and thy rod\r\nwherewith thou smotest the river; take it in thine hand and go.\r\nBehold, I will stand before thee upon the rock in Horeb, and thou\r\nshalt smite the rock, and then shall come water out of it, that the\r\npeople may drink; and Moses did so in the sight of the elders of\r\nIsrael.\"\r\n\r\nIn the 20th chapter of Numbers we read of a similar miracle occurring\r\nthree years afterward--\"And Moses took the rod from before the Lord as\r\nhe commanded him, and said, Hear, now, ye rebels, must we fetch water\r\nout of this rock. And Moses lifted up his hand and with his rod smote\r\nthe rock twice, and the water came out abundantly and the congregation\r\ndrank and their beasts also.\"\r\n\r\nNow in the 21st chapter of Numbers we find these verses: \"And from\r\nthence they went to Beer, that is, the well whereof the Lord spake\r\nunto Moses. Gather the people together and I will give them water.\r\nThen sang Israel this song--Spring up, O, well! sing ye unto it. The\r\nprinces digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by the\r\ndirection of the lawgiver, with their staves.\" This shows that the\r\nlawgiver pointed out the places for them to dig, and the people made\r\nthe wells.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing like faithful searching if you wish to find; so I\r\nadvise you to look back also as far as Confucius, and then come down\r\nto the old monk, Roger Bacon, and it would not surprise me if you\r\nshould ascertain that those old wise-heads had gone even farther than\r\nyour humble servant into the mysteries of the divining rod.\r\n\r\nBut I will not quote from these ancients; I will only look back a\r\nshort hundred years. In Sir David Brewster's Philosophy you will find\r\nthat he says that there is no doubt that the presence of water can be\r\ndetected by the divining rod, although it can not be demonstrated by\r\nany known science. It was this last paragraph which I stumbled upon\r\nmany years ago, that first brought me to a practical knowledge of this\r\nphenomenon. I read it, and being on a visit in Raymond, Miss., I went\r\nto Judge ----, of that place, a scholar and a man of good sense, whom\r\nI took for granted had not failed to gather in, among his great stores\r\nof learning, something about the topic which had struck me so\r\nforcibly. I was not mistaken; the old gentleman told me that he had\r\nnot only heard a good deal about this matter, but possessed, himself,\r\nthe power of finding water, offering to show me how he proceeded. Soon\r\nafter we went, accompanied by my brother, Dr. L., to a spot where\r\nthere was a well known under-ground stream. The Judge cut three forked\r\nbranches from a peach tree, each took one and we marched over the spot\r\nindicated, holding our rods according to the approved style of the\r\n\"dowser\" proper. At a certain point the switches in the hands of the\r\nJudge and myself went down simultaneously; the effect was very\r\napparent; but my brother, in whose hands there was no movement,\r\nmercilessly ridiculed the whole proceeding; neither the Judge nor\r\nI being at all disconcerted by his skeptical derision of our\r\n_scientific_ research. I could not be shaken from faith in my actual,\r\nabsolute experience, and was fully convinced that there was a\r\nmysterious power, beyond my ken, that turned the switch. I pondered\r\nover the matter, and resolved that at some future day I would examine\r\nmore closely into it.\r\n\r\nThis, to me, decisive epoch finally came after a great number of\r\ntrials, always with satisfactory results as to the bare fact that\r\nwater could be traced or discovered. That the switch did turn in my\r\nhand readily was undoubtedly true--the agency which moved it was the\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\nI knew that electricity had broad shoulders, and had always carried\r\nthe weight of every unexplained phenomenon. I said this switch turns\r\nby electric force. Having evolved my theory, I set out to sustain it,\r\nby experiment. Upon inquiry, I found that not only could water be\r\ndiscovered, but it was asserted that minerals as readily answered to\r\nthe call of the magic rod; and, indeed, that even their depth beneath\r\nthe earth's surface might be computed.\r\n\r\nGranting this to be true, I concluded that I had not only a\r\nphilosophical but a mathematical problem to solve. I, however, never\r\nmet any one having any information on this latter point, nor in my\r\nreadings did I find any allusion to the possibility of ascertaining\r\nthe depth below the surface of any concealed stream or mineral. On the\r\ncontrary, I found the general impression to be that the whole thing\r\nwas a superstition of ignorant minds. The doubters frequently met me,\r\nand with some show of reason, with this personal argument: \"I cannot\r\nbelieve this thing, because the switch does not turn in my hand.\" It\r\nis quite true that every hand does not have the power of giving the\r\nmotion to the switch; but this does not disprove the fact of its\r\nturning. I have heard that the evidence of one man who heard a bell is\r\nworth that of a dozen who did not hear it. The testimony is,\r\ntherefore, to my mind, clearly in favor of the \"dowsers.\" All men are\r\nnot the same conductors of electricity. I have known persons who could\r\nlight the gas by running across the floor, rubbing their feet upon the\r\ncarpet, and pointing a finger at the jet. I never saw this done, but I\r\nhave no doubt that there are many who can do it, and also many who\r\ncannot.\r\n\r\nNow, although the switch may not turn in the hands of all, this is no\r\nproof that the current producing the movement does not pass through\r\nthe persons just the same--the effect is only less perceptible in\r\nsome, than in others.\r\n\r\nI had made a very large number of experiments, from time to time,\r\nbefore I had an opportunity to make one which satisfied me that I was\r\non the right track. I had in these experiments exploded the\r\nsuperstition of the \"witch-hazel,\" and learned that peach, apple,\r\nwillow, dog-wood, beech, maple, iron, steel, copper--in fact, that\r\neven an old barrel hoop possessed all of its virtues, and so concluded\r\nthat after all this relic of the necromancer's art of former days was\r\na very simple matter, if we could but find the clue to it. A few years\r\nago it happened that I wanted to get water at a place called Coloma,\r\nupon the Chicago, Michigan & Lake Shore Railroad, of which I was then\r\nchief engineer. I concluded to test my electric theory here. I found\r\nthat it was necessary to dig a well upon the depot grounds--the point\r\nwas to see if I could find water where I needed a tank. I took a\r\nswitch and found water near the desired spot; then, with my theory in\r\nview, I made a second experiment. I bought four ink bottles, adjusted\r\nthem to a pair of wooden sandals, which I fastened to my feet. Thus\r\ninsulated, I walked over the ground, my switch in hand, but, as I had\r\nanticipated, there was no movement--the diviner's rod was powerless. I\r\ntherefore assume that I am right in ascribing the phenomenon to\r\nelectricity. I continued my experiments, having yet the mathematical\r\npoint unsettled. Upon walking over the ground again and again, I found\r\nthat the switch commenced always to turn at the same places, equally\r\n(or nearly) distant from a centre, and kept gradually turning until it\r\npointed directly downward. To assure myself, I repeated this\r\nexperiment many times, and arrived at the conclusion that the switch\r\ncommenced to turn at an angle of forty-five degrees from the edge of\r\nthe water, and that the distance from my hand to the water would be\r\nmeasured by the distance from the point where the switch commenced to\r\nturn to the point of absolute turn-down, and so it seems to be. The\r\nfollowing diagram will show more clearly my meaning:\r\n\r\nA B, B A is the surface of the earth; W, a stream or pool of water\r\nbelow the surface. Walking along toward A B the switch begins to move\r\nat A, and turns down at B; the angles B A C and B C A being equal, the\r\ndistance from A to B is equal to B C. Measure the distance, therefore,\r\nfrom the point of commencement of turning to the point of turn-down,\r\nand you have the depth from your hand to the water. I have verified\r\nthis over many water-courses, upon bridges, etc., and I am satisfied\r\nit is correct, at least for the latitude in which my experiments were\r\nmade. Upon this basis I made my first estimate of the depth of the\r\nwater at Coloma, and gave it as from twenty-five to thirty feet. I\r\nemployed an experienced well borer and had a two and one-half inch\r\npipe driven into the ground at the exact point my switch indicated,\r\nand found water at twenty-seven feet exactly. I had the pipe driven\r\ndown forty feet, and found that I had thirteen feet of water in it. I\r\nthen had a windmill erected and a large tank. Up to the time of my\r\nleaving the road, the engines were supplied with the water, which,\r\nbesides, proved to be of excellent quality for drinking.\r\n\r\nMy well borer, who was a doubting Thomas, said he believed that he\r\ncould get water at the same depth anywhere. Fortunately for my theory,\r\na neighboring store-keeper tried the doubter and failed to get water\r\nunder fifty-nine feet.\r\n\r\nSubsequent to the satisfactory experiment at Coloma it happened that\r\non one occasion, when I was traveling west on the Hannibal & St.\r\nJoseph Railroad, that I was introduced to a gentleman engaged in\r\nbuilding a road, who related to me that during its construction the\r\nengineers had made use of drive wells as they moved rapidly along. As\r\nthe water question was always one of interest to me, our conversation\r\ndrifted, naturally, to \"water-witching.\" The gentleman said that all\r\nof his knowledge on this subject had been obtained from his brother--a\r\nyoung man employed by Horace Greeley on his farm at Chappaqua. Mr.\r\nGreeley had sent for him from hearing of him as extremely intelligent\r\nand thrifty as a farm hand. It happened while the young man was at\r\nChappaqua that a well was needed, and the question of \"water-witching\"\r\ncame up. The young man said that his belief was, that if one man could\r\nfind water, so could another--whereupon he took a forked switch and,\r\nwalking about, found that the magic wand turned down over a rock. He\r\nhad a blast of powder put in at the point, the smoke of which hardly\r\ncleared away, revealed a spring of water. Here is simply a repetition\r\nof the smiting of the rock. In my own experience I have a similar\r\ninstance: I was assistant superintendent at Highlands, on the Vandalia\r\nline. Mr. ----, then chief engineer, had, previous to my arrival,\r\ncaused a well of ten feet diameter and forty feet depth to be dug and\r\nwalled up with brick, but the supply of water was so small that it\r\ncould be pumped out in a few minutes. A hole had then been drilled\r\nsixteen feet to the rock, which was conglomerate, of very great\r\nhardness, with no better results. The well was therefore abandoned. If\r\nI had seen Mr. ----, I should have advised penetrating the rock, but I\r\ndid not meet him, and did not wish to interfere with the work.\r\n\r\nMr. Koepfle, the owner of the land upon which the well was located,\r\narrived just at that time from Switzerland, and I soon became\r\nacquainted with him. He came into my office one day and said: \"Mr.\r\nLatimer, do you not think there is water under that ground?\" I\r\nreplied, \"Yes, I thought so.\" \"Did you ever hear of 'water-witching?'\"\r\nhe then asked. I said \"Yes.\" \"Can you tell where water is?\" Upon my\r\naffirmative answer he requested me to go down and try a switch. I did\r\nso and found that it turned down in a number of places about the well.\r\nMr. Koepfle came to me again to say that there was a \"dowser\" in the\r\nneighborhood and to ask me what I thought of his employing him. I\r\nadvised him to try the skill of this man by all means. I was not\r\npresent at the trial, but a short time afterward Mr. K. came to me in\r\ngreat excitement to tell me that the man said there was a subterranean\r\nlake at that very point. Among other things, he told me that the wand\r\nin this case was a bit of whalebone--an item I treasured for future\r\nconsideration. Mr. ---- had already commenced another well in a marsh\r\nabout half a mile west of the first. Mr. Koepfle asked my advice as to\r\nwhat he should do. I replied, \"I cannot take any action in the matter\r\nofficially, but if you will take it upon yourself to bore through that\r\nrock and pay the expense of it, I think that no objection can be made\r\nto it, and I believe that you will get plenty of water--in which case,\r\nI am sure you will not lose your money.\" \"But where can I get a man?\"\r\nurged Mr. Koepfle. \"Try Mr. ----'s man. I think Mr. ---- will be glad\r\nto get rid of the expense,\" I said. Mr. K. came soon after with the\r\nman and agreed, by my advice, to give him $7.50 per day for his own\r\nwork and that of his man with the drills. In five days the rock was\r\nsmitten through with a three-inch drill, and the water immediately\r\nrushed up to a point above the natural surface of the ground, only\r\nheld by the railroad bank--which surrounded the well--and there\r\nremained. I am not aware that Mr. ---- ever knew that his excellent\r\nwell water was provided for him by the magic power of a morsel of\r\nwhalebone and a peach twig.\r\n\r\nUpon one occasion, at a farm of one of my connections, the water gave\r\nout in the well, (seventeen feet deep,) which had for years supplied a\r\nlarge number of cattle. In the first place I ordered the well to be\r\ncleaned out, for it was very dirty; but there was no improvement. It\r\nwas then decided to dig another. I found a place about ten feet north\r\nof the old well, where I judged there was a small stream, and\r\nrepeatedly estimated the depth to it by my rule, and came to the\r\nconclusion that it was between ten and twelve feet. I was rather\r\nastonished at this, for the water, it may be observed, was seventeen\r\nfeet deep in the old well. However the well was begun. I asked the\r\ndigger at what depth water ought to be found; he said at seventeen\r\nfeet; but I made this a test case, and said, \"You will find water here\r\nbetween ten and twelve feet, but if I should have to say precisely, I\r\nshould say at ten feet.\" Water was found at exactly ten feet, and\r\nstood at that point after the well was finished.\r\n\r\nA peculiar test occurred at Toulon, Illinois. I was talking on the\r\nsubject with a friend, a lawyer of that place, one dark night at about\r\nnine o'clock. He asked, \"Can you tell how deep it is to the water in\r\nthe well in this hotel yard?\" I answered at once, \"Yes,\" but said, \"it\r\nis rather dark, and I know nothing about the yard or the position of\r\nthe well.\" However I went out and started at the kitchen door, only\r\nasking upon which side of the house I should seek. I traced the stream\r\nfrom the kitchen door, passing back and forth rapidly until I found\r\nthe well about forty feet from the kitchen and near the barn. When I\r\ncame to the well I said, \"This stream passes five feet from the well\r\nand does not go directly into it.\" I then made some examination with\r\nthe rod, and pronounced the depth to the water to be fourteen feet,\r\nwhich was found by measurement to be correct. I will add, that I was\r\nnever before in the hotel yard, did not know where the well was\r\nlocated, and the night was exceedingly dark. The next morning, while\r\npaying my bill, the landlord said, \"You probably do not know how close\r\nwas your calculation last night. I had that well dug myself, and we\r\nwent down forty feet without finding water. Before giving it up the\r\ndigger had himself lowered into the well, listening as he went to hear\r\nthe sound of some stream. At fourteen feet he heard water, and boring\r\nin laterally five feet, where you said the stream was, he found a\r\nplentiful supply, filling the well with twenty-three feet of water.\"\r\n\r\nAnother experience. One day at Wyoming, Ill., a friend said to me, \"I\r\nmust introduce you to our 'water-witch,'\" who proved to be a gentleman\r\nnamed ----, a banker of the place. After some conversation with him,\r\nwe agreed to try an experiment together and compare experiences\r\ngenerally. I asked first, \"What do you use?\" \"Willow, hazel or\r\npeach--perhaps any green twig would do as well; but I only employ\r\nthose three.\" \"What would you say to an old barrel hoop?\" I asked.\r\n\"Oh, that would not do at all; there must be sap in the wood.\" We each\r\ntook our rod and went forth, I holding mine in my hands, whilst my\r\ncompanion held one end of his in his teeth, the other in both hands. I\r\nasked what he meant by that mode of holding the switch. He replied,\r\n\"That is my way; there is no chance for presumption or pretence in it;\r\nsome persons can make the switch turn and be deceived.\" I observed\r\nthat our switches moved at the same moment, mine turning down, his\r\nsidewise; but in every case we agreed, and thus traced a number of\r\nstreams. I tried his plan, but it would not answer, while his switch\r\nmoved held in either way. In discussing the matter, I asked his\r\ntheory, which he declined to give, but which I divined by a question\r\nhe asked, viz: \"Did you ever see a switch turn for stagnant water?\" I\r\nsaid, \"Yes.\" \"Well,\" he responded, \"I never did, and the rod will not\r\nturn over stagnant water for me.\" \"Now,\" said I, \"I understand your\r\ntheory; it is that the friction of running waters underground produces\r\nan electric current which causes the switch to turn.\" He admitted that\r\nI was right. \"Now,\" I said, \"I propose to explode two of your notions\r\nat once. In the first place, let us get an old barrel hoop.\" I found\r\none, which we divided. I then went with him across the railroad track,\r\nwhich at that place runs north and south. The rod turned down for both\r\nof us at once; in this case he used the rod in his hand. \"Now, you\r\nsee,\" I said, \"that the rail represents stagnant water, and you find\r\nthat a dry twig or stick is as good as a green one.\" I then obtained a\r\npiece of copper wire from the telegraph office and gave him. He walked\r\nacross the track with it in his mouth and hands, and in every case the\r\nrod turned to the south for him. In finding water the rod always\r\nturned for him in the direction the stream ran. I found he knew\r\nnothing about estimating the depth beneath the surface. He remarked\r\nthat he had fancied that he knew much of the subject, but that a man\r\nmust \"live and learn.\" I went with him to his bank, where we threw\r\ndown a rod of iron on the floor, and with our switches found the\r\nmovement to be the same at every trial. Again, we placed a silver coin\r\non the floor, with the same result--trying several times with his hand\r\non my arm. I told him that I meant to invent an instrument for finding\r\nwater and estimating its depth. A few months ago I received a letter\r\nfrom him, asking after my proposed invention. This gentleman gave me a\r\ncurious confirmation of my experiment at Coloma. He related that a few\r\ndays previous a friend had been out with him to try if the switch\r\nwould turn in his hand. It did readily; but after dinner he found,\r\nupon a second trial, that there was no movement. This mystery was soon\r\nexplained by the discovery that our neophyte was standing in his\r\nIndia-rubber shoes.\r\n\r\nAnother important test I made at the Naval Academy, at Annapolis, a\r\nfew years ago. I went there to look at Sir David Thompson's\r\nElectrometer, to ascertain if it could give me a clue to something\r\nwhich might guide me in the invention of the instrument in question. I\r\ncould discover nothing from it, or from the most delicate\r\ngalvanometer. One of the professors, however, asked me to give them a\r\ntest. I called for a piece of iron wire, walked a few feet, put my\r\nfoot down and said \"There is something immediately under here.\" The\r\nboard was taken up and disclosed the gas-pipe. I asked if they were\r\nsatisfied. \"You are a man of quick perceptions and might have noticed\r\nthe direction of the pipe,\" was the answer. \"Are you willing to be\r\nblindfolded?\" I consented and succeeded repeatedly in locating the\r\npipe, and what is more, in indicating other points of attraction to\r\nthe rod, where all said that my experiment had failed, but which\r\nproved as full a confirmation of my theory as the lead pipe. These\r\npoints were those where the iron columns supporting the building\r\ntouched the ceiling underneath.\r\n\r\nUpon one occasion, I visited Professor Henry, of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitute, and presented the subject to him. The professor took notes\r\nin a book, and asked for a test. I gave him several by locating the\r\ngas and water pipes. We then sat down and the professor remarked:\r\n\"This is all personal influence.\" Of course, the question is none the\r\nless important or curious on this account, and I was a little nettled\r\nat the summary disposal of the matter. I therefore replied: \"Professor\r\nHenry, you scientific men are always behindhand in discoveries,\r\nbecause you will not investigate, and it is left to those not well\r\nversed in the laws of science to ferret out mysteries and lay them\r\nbare. I present you two things, Professor--first, I find, by\r\ninsulating myself that there is no motion of the rod, which proves\r\nelectricity; second, I show that the motion begins at a certain\r\npoint--an angle of forty-five degrees from the concealed water or\r\nmetal--and the rod turns down directly over it; thus physical science\r\nand mathematics disprove your theory.\" I will say that my remarks\r\nmoved the professor, who then showed a very decided interest and asked\r\nme to come and spend the following morning with him. Unfortunately, my\r\ndeparture from the city deprived me of the proposed interview. I have\r\nhad many other experiences, but the relation of them would demand more\r\ntime than it is expedient to give to them at present. I would add that\r\nI have observed in my experiments that the smallest underground stream\r\naffects the rod in my hand in the same degree as the cataract of\r\nNiagara itself, and that the presence of a stove, a bar of iron, or\r\nany other metal--a water or gas pipe, causes it to turn with the same\r\nmovement as a large mineral deposit; but it is my belief that there is\r\na hidden mode of distinguishing between them all, outside of all\r\nquestions of personal influence. We know that in what we call the dark\r\nage of the world, all unexplained phenomena were referred to personal\r\nwitchcraft. We, as yet, know little of the many phenomena of\r\nelectricity, and in the midst of our own intelligent population we\r\nfind, that, to very many, the working of the electric telegraph itself\r\nis ascribed to superhuman agency. Only a few days ago an intelligent\r\ntelegraph operator and his wife, at Horican, thought the spirits were\r\ncommunicating with him through the wires because they heard the air\r\n\"Home, Sweet Home\" in their vibrations--not knowing that he was\r\nreceiving a musical message from the newly invented telephone, played\r\nat Chicago, many miles distant.\r\n\r\nI have desired to show that the use of the \"divining rod\" is at least\r\nas old as the Mosaic dispensation; that the knowledge or tradition of\r\nits use has been understood, to some extent, by certain \"wise\" men in\r\nall ages, and that in the present age--one of inquiry and\r\nresearch--many have a knowledge of it and make use of it to their own\r\nadvantage; that there is no superstition in the matter, but that it is\r\ngoverned by fixed laws; that it requires only intelligent research and\r\nearnest investigation to understand them thoroughly, and, finally, to\r\narrive at results of the greatest practical benefit to mankind.\r\n\r\nWhen we understand that the earth is a great electric ball, giving and\r\nreceiving electricity with the nature of the conductors which\r\ntransport or absorb the various currents, we may arrive at more\r\ncomprehensive and correct theories about natural phenomena.\r\n\r\nI picked up, a few days since, a periodical containing an admirable\r\narticle on the Electric Telegraph, describing most vividly the motion\r\nof the currents, and I make use of the words of the writer to\r\nillustrate how it is possible to bring this subject to a scientific\r\ntest:\r\n\r\n\"The observer, whom we have supposed capable of seeing electricity,\r\nwould find that the whole surface of the earth, the atmosphere and\r\nprobably the fathomless space beyond, were teeming with manifestations\r\nof the electric force. Every chemical process and every blow in nature\r\nor in art evolves it. The great process of vegetation and the\r\nreciprocal process of animal life all over the globe are accompanied\r\nby it. As incessantly as the sun's rays pass around the earth, warming\r\nevery part in alternation with the cooling influences of night, great\r\ncurrents or fluctuations of magnetic tension, which never cease their\r\nplay, circulate about the globe, and other apparently irregular\r\ncurrents come and go according to laws not yet understood; while the\r\naurora borealis, flaming in the sky, indicates the measureless extent\r\nof this wonderful power, the existence of which the world has but\r\nbegun to discover. Our observer would see that these great earth\r\ncurrents infinitely transcend the little artificial currents which men\r\nproduce in their insulated wires, and that they constantly interfere\r\nwith the latter, attracting or driving them from their work, and\r\nmaking them play truant, greatly to the vexation of the operators and\r\nsometimes to the entire confusion of business. If a thunder-storm\r\npassed across the country, he would see all the wires sparkling with\r\nunusual excitement. When the rain fell and water, which is a\r\nconductor, trickled along the wires and stood in drops upon the\r\ninsulators, he would see the electricity of the line deserting its\r\npath and stealing off slyly, in greater or less quantities, over the\r\nwet surface of the insulators or by the wet straws or kite strings\r\nwhich sometimes hang across the line. Now and then he might see the\r\nfree electricity of the storm overleap the barriers and take\r\npossession for the moment of some unguarded circuit, frightening\r\noperators from their posts. Such an observer would realize what it is\r\ndifficult adequately to conceive, that electricity is, as has been\r\nsaid, the hidden force in nature, and still remains, as far as man is\r\nconcerned, almost dormant. A high scientific authority has remarked,\r\nin speaking of metals, that the abundance of any object in nature,\r\nbears a proportion to its adaptation to the service of man. If this be\r\ntrue in general, we may expect electricity will become, one day, a\r\nfamiliar thing.\"\r\n\r\nI conclude with a word from the wise and godly man I have before\r\ncited: \"Oh that mine enemy would write a book,\" cried Job. Of course,\r\nhe meant a book setting forth some new-fangled idea which he knew\r\nwould bring upon its author the whole army of cavilers. This my little\r\nbook or essay may bring upon me the same legions, grown mightier with\r\nthe centuries which have elapsed since Job's day. To them, I can only\r\nreply, \"Truth is mighty and will prevail.\"\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n_From Dr. Ashburner in Reichenbach's Dynamics of Magnetism._\r\n\r\nHowever vulgar and absurd, because, perhaps, not severely exact to\r\nhabitually erroneous thinkers themselves, may appear much of the\r\nknowledge floating among boors and peasants, a very remarkable proof\r\nof the importance of some of it is seen in a singular, though rude\r\nanticipation of a part of the most brilliant of Professor Faraday's\r\ndiscoveries on magnetism and diamagnetism by means of an instrument,\r\nthe name of which has been sufficient to excite the contempt of some\r\nso-styled _savans_ of repute. If knowledge be not in the range of the\r\nthoughts of certain severe cogitators, it is then forsooth, no\r\nknowledge at all. The unmerciful contempt which has been cast on the\r\n_divining rod--virgula divina_ or _baguette divinatoire_--by certain\r\ncultivators of science may be estimated by a reference to the earlier\r\neditions of a translation by Dr. Hutton, of Montucla's improvement of\r\nOzanam's Mathematical Recreations, a book full of most interesting\r\nmatter.--In the last edition of that work, however, Dr. Hutton proved\r\nhimself to be, what he always was, a sincere lover of truth. Led into\r\nerror at an earlier period, he was open to inquiry, and became,\r\nsubsequently, convinced of facts, the existence of which he had at one\r\ntime doubted. My friend, Mr. Charles Hutton Gregory, lent me a copy of\r\nthe Speculum Anni for the year, 1828, in which he pointed out some\r\npassages relating to this matter which I cannot avoid extracting here,\r\nand premising a few observations on the instrument called the divining\r\nrod, _virgula divina_, _baculus divinatorius_, _baguette divinatoire_.\r\nThis has been supposed to be a branch of a tree or shrub, necessarily\r\nof a forked or letter V shape, by the assistance of which, certain\r\ngifted persons were enabled to discover mines, springs of water\r\nunderground, hidden treasures, and to practice other occult doings.\r\nThis, with regard to shape, is just as vulgar an error as that which\r\nsupposes that a stick of any kind of wood, held in the hand, serves as\r\nwell as the hazel or white thorn, for the production of the phenomena.\r\nIn the counties of Somerset, Devon and Cornwall, the facts on this\r\nsubject are well known, and the practice of \"dowsing,\" as it is\r\ncalled, has been cultivated time out of mind. In France, the men of\r\nscientific pursuit have for the most part ridiculed the use of the\r\nbaguette, notwithstanding abundant evidence in various parts of the\r\ncountry being extant of the success which has attended the practice of\r\nthe _sourciers_. The Baron Von Reichenbach has established facts\r\nregarding the emanation of lights from graves which are quite as\r\nremarkable as the proofs of emanations taking place from metals or\r\nfrom running water. Now that the Baron's researches and the concurrent\r\ntestimony of the cultivators of mesmeric science have established that\r\ncertain individuals are more susceptible of magnetic impressions than\r\nothers, it will not be pronounced impossible that subterraneous\r\nrunning water may influence some persons and not others. In different\r\nclasses the sensitive powers are known to vary greatly as they do\r\nindeed among those of the same species. \"But,\" it has been asked,\r\n\"granting that emanations from subterraneous waters may powerfully\r\neffect certain persons, what connection is there between this\r\nimpression and the motion or rotation of the hazel rod which is held\r\nin the person's hand or laid over his fingers?\" What! is it fact that\r\nthe hazel rod or white thorn moves or rotates in the hands of a person\r\nof a certain impressionability, when that person passes over any\r\nground underneath his footsteps on which there happens to be a\r\nmetallic lode or a subterraneous stream of water which we call a\r\nspring? I have been informed by highly respectable persons, who have\r\nin the West of England, witnessed the facts, that under these\r\ncircumstances a hazel or a white thorn rod does rotate and does move\r\nand occasionally dips with so energetic a force that on one occasion\r\nthe bark of a fresh hazel rod was stripped from the stick and left in\r\nthe grasp of the operator's hand.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts will further illustrate the subject: \"Although\r\nthe effects or motion of the divining rod, when in the proximity of\r\nsprings, has been and is to this day considered by most philosophers a\r\nmere illusion, yet I think the following brief observations relating\r\nto the subject, and which was communicated to Dr. Hutton by a lady of\r\nrank, with the account of her subsequent experiments performed before\r\nhim, his family and a number of friends, (as given in the Doctor's\r\ntranslation of Montucla's edition of Ozanam's Recreations), must\r\nconvince the most incredulous that in the hands of some persons in\r\ncertain situations the baguette is forcibly acted on by some unknown,\r\ninvisible cause. Notwithstanding the incredulity expressed by Montucla\r\nrelative to the indication of springs by the baguette or divining rod,\r\nthere appears to exist such evidences of the reality of that motion as\r\nit seems next to be impossible to be questioned. This evidence was\r\nbrought about in the following manner. Soon after the publication of\r\nthe former edition of the Recreations, the editor received by the post\r\nthe following well written pseudonymous letter on the subject of this\r\nproblem. The letter in question is dated Feb. 10, 1805, and, as with\r\nthe whole correspondence it would be too long for our limits, I shall\r\nselect such parts only as are immediately essential to a right\r\nunderstanding of the subject.\r\n\r\n\"The lady observes, 'In the year 1772, (I was then nineteen), I passed\r\nsix months at Aix, in Provence. I there heard the popular story of one\r\nof the fountains in that city having been discovered by a boy who\r\nalways expressed an aversion for passing one particular spot, crying\r\nout each time _there was water_. This was held by myself and by the\r\nfamily I was with, in utter contempt. In the course of the spring the\r\nfamily went to pass a week at the Chateau d'Ansonis, situated a few\r\nmiles to the north of the Durance, a tract of country very mountainous\r\nand where water was ill supplied. We found the Marquis d'Ansonis\r\nbusied in erecting what may be termed a miniature aqueduct to convey a\r\nspring the distance of half a league, or nearly as much, to his\r\nchateau, which spring he asserted had been found out by a peasant, who\r\nmade the discovery of water his occupation in that country, and\r\nmaintained himself by it, and was known by the appellation of _L'Homme\r\na la Baguette_. This account was received with unbelief almost\r\namounting to derision. The Marquis, piqued with being discredited,\r\nsent for the man and requested we would witness the experiment. A\r\nlarge party of French and English accordingly attended. The man was\r\nquite a peasant in manners and appearance: he produced some twigs cut\r\nfrom a hazel, of different sizes and strength, only they were forked\r\nbranches, and hazel was preferred as forking more equally than most\r\nother trees, but it was not requisite that the angle should be of any\r\nparticular number of degrees. He held the ends of the twigs between\r\neach forefinger and thumb, with the vertex pointing downwards.\r\nStanding where there was no water, the baguette remained motionless.\r\nWalking gradually to the spot where the spring was _under ground_, the\r\ntwig was sensibly affected; and, as he approached the spot, began to\r\nturn round; that is, the vertex raised itself and turned towards his\r\nbody, and continued to turn till the point was vertical; it then\r\ndescended outwards, and continued to turn, describing a circle as long\r\nas he remained standing over the spring, or till one or both the\r\nbranches were broken by the twisting, the ends being firmly grasped by\r\nthe fingers and thumbs, and the hands kept stationary, so that the\r\nrotary motion must, of course, twist them. After seeing him do this\r\nrepeatedly, the whole party tried the baguette in succession, but\r\nwithout effect. I chanced to be the last. No sooner did I hold the\r\ntwig as directed than it began to move as with him, which startled me\r\nso much, that I dropt it and felt considerably agitated. I was,\r\nhowever, induced to resume the experiment, and the effect was perfect.\r\nI was then told it was no very unusual thing, many having that\r\nfaculty--which, from what has since come to my knowledge, I have\r\nreason to believe is true. On my return to England I forbore to let\r\nthis faculty (or whatever you may term it) be known, fearing to become\r\nthe topic of conversation or discussion. But two years afterwards,\r\nbeing on a visit to a nobleman's house, Kimbolton, Huntingdonshire,\r\nand his lady lamenting that she was disappointed of building a dairy\r\nhouse on a spot she particularly wished, because there was no water to\r\nbe found--a supply she looked on as essential--under _promise of\r\nsecresy_ I told her I would endeavor to find a spring. I accordingly\r\nprocured some hazel twigs, and in the presence of herself and\r\nhusband, walked over the ground proposed, till the twig turned with\r\n_considerable force_. A stake was immediately driven into the ground\r\nto mark the spot, which was not very distant from where they had\r\nbefore sunk. They then took me to another and distant building in the\r\npark, and desired me to try there. I found the baguette turn _very\r\nstrong_, so that it soon twisted and broke. The gentleman persisted\r\nthat there was no water there, unless at a great depth, the foundation\r\nbeing very deep (a considerable stone cellar) and that no water\r\nappeared when they dug for it. I could only reply that I knew no\r\nmore than from the baguette turning, and that I had too little\r\nexperience of its powers or certainty, to answer for the truth of its\r\nindications. He then acknowledged that when that building was erected\r\nthey were obliged to drive piles for the whole foundation, as they met\r\nwith nothing but a quicksand. This induced him to dig in the spot I\r\nfirst directed. They met with a very fluent spring; the dairy was\r\nbuilt and it is at this time supplied by it. I could give a long\r\ndetail of other trials I have made, all of which have been convincing\r\nof the truth, but they would be tedious. For some years past, I have\r\nbeen indifferent about its becoming known, and have consequently been\r\nfrequently requested to show the experiment, which has often been done\r\nto persons of high estimation for understanding and knowledge, and I\r\nbelieve they have all been convinced. Three people I have met with who\r\nhave, on trying, found themselves possessed of the same faculty. I\r\nshall add only one more particular incident. Having once shown it to a\r\nparty, we returned into the house to a room on the ground floor. I was\r\nagain asked _how I held the twig_. Taking one in my hand, I found it\r\nturned immediately; on which an old lady, mother to the gentleman of\r\nthe house, said that room was formed out of an old cloister, in which\r\ncloister was a _well_, simply boarded over when they made the room.\r\n\r\n\"'L'Homme a la Baguette, from experience, could with tolerable\r\naccuracy, tell the depth at which the springs were, and their volume,\r\nfrom the force with which the baguette turned; I can only give a rough\r\nguess. In strong frost, I think its powers not so great. On a bridge\r\nor in a boat, I think it has no effect--the water must be under ground\r\nto affect the baguette, and running through wooden pipes acts the same\r\nas a spring. I can neither make the baguette turn where there is _no\r\nwater_, nor prevent it from turning where there is any, and I am\r\nperfectly ignorant of _the cause why it turns_. The only sensation I\r\nam conscious of, is, an emotion similar to that felt on being startled\r\nby sudden noise, or surprise of any kind.\r\n\r\n\"'I generally use a baguette about six inches from the vertex to the\r\nends of the twigs where they are cut off.\r\n\r\n\"'I shall most probably be in London next winter, and will (if you\r\nwish it) afford you an opportunity of making your own observations on\r\nthis curious fact.'\r\n\r\n\"The lady arrived in London, wrote to Dr. Hutton to inform him that\r\nshe proposed being in Woolwich on Friday, the 30th inst., (May, 1806,)\r\nat eleven in the forenoon. 'Accordingly,' says Dr. H., 'at the time\r\nappointed, the lady, with all her family, arrived at my house at\r\nWoolwich Common, where, after preparing the rods, etc., they walked\r\nout to the grounds, accompanied by the individuals of my own family\r\nand some friends; when Lady ---- showed the experiment several times\r\nin different places, holding the rods, etc., in the manner as\r\ndescribed in her Ladyship's first letter above given. In the places\r\nwhere I had good reason to know that no water was to be found, the rod\r\nwas always quiescent; but in other places, where I knew there was\r\nwater below the surface, the rods turned slowly and regularly, in the\r\nmanner above described, till the twigs twisted themselves off below\r\nthe fingers, which were considerably indented by so forcibly holding\r\nthe rods between them.\r\n\r\n\"'All the company present stood close around the lady, with all eyes\r\nintently fixed on her hands and the rods, to watch if any particular\r\nmotion might be made by the fingers, but in vain; nothing of the kind\r\nwas perceived, and all the company could observe no cause or reason\r\nwhy the rods should move in the manner they were seen to do. After the\r\nexperiments were ended, every one of the company tried the rods in the\r\nsame manner as they saw the lady had done, but without the least\r\nmotion from any of them. And, in my family, among ourselves, we have\r\nsince then several times tried if we could possibly cause the rod to\r\nturn by means of any trick, or twisting of the fingers held in the\r\nmanner the lady did; but in vain; we had no power to accomplish it.'\r\n\r\n\"The annexed figure represents the form and position of the rod, about\r\nsix inches in length, cut off just below the joint or junction of the\r\ntwo twigs.\r\n\r\n\"There can be no impropriety in stating now that the lady in question\r\nwas the Honorable Lady Milbanke, wife of Sir Ralph Milbanke, Bart.,\r\n(afterward Noel,) and mother of the present Dowager Lady Byron, wife\r\nand widow of the great poet. A very interesting analogous statement\r\nrelating to the same person will be found in the _Quarterly Review_\r\nfor March, 1820, No. XLIV, volume 22.\r\n\r\n\"Lately, in France, the Count de Tristan has published a work on the\r\nsubject, and a most interesting volume, containing two memoirs, has\r\nbeen written by M. Thouvenel, a physician of reputation in France, who\r\nwas commissioned in the year 1781, by the king, to analyze and report\r\nupon the mineral and medicinal waters of the kingdom. The author\r\nundertakes a patient and laborious investigation, in the spirit of a\r\nphilosopher, and regards his inquiries as leading to a new thread in\r\nthe tangled skein of physics, which, like any fact of science, may\r\nlead to the discovery of a thousand others; a fact which may have\r\nescaped the vigilant sagacity of observers, or which may have been\r\ntotally abandoned to the blind credulity of worthy soft-headed\r\npersons, or, in short, since the reign of a kind of false philosophy,\r\nthe offspring of scientific pride, may have been delivered over to the\r\npresumption of men of false wisdom. Thouvenel found a man named\r\nBleton, whose business was that of a _sourcier_, or discoverer of\r\nsprings by means of the divining rod, and upon this man he made more\r\nthan six hundred observations, many of them in the presence of above\r\none hundred and fifty persons, mostly of important stations, and very\r\ncreditable from their high character, who testify to the truth of the\r\nobserved phenomena. Among others, was M. Jadelet, professor of physic\r\nat Nancy, a man eminent for his abilities, who was not only a witness\r\nof these experiments, but was actually concerned in the greatest part\r\nof them. As in the case of Lady Milbanke, with Bleton an _internal\r\nfeeling_ was coincident with the movement of the rod. Whenever this\r\nman was in a place where there existed subterraneous waters, he was\r\nimmediately sensible of a lively impression, referable to the\r\ndiaphragm, which he called his \"_commotion_.\" This was followed by a\r\nsense of oppression in the upper part of the chest; at the same time\r\nhe felt a shock, with general tremor and chilliness, staggering of the\r\nlegs, stiffness of the wrists, with twitchings, a concentrated pulse,\r\nwhich gradually diminished. All these symptoms were more or less\r\nstrong, according to the volume and depth of the water, and they were\r\nmore sensibly felt when Bleton _went in a direction against_ the\r\nsubterranean current than when he _followed its course_. Stagnant\r\nwater under ground did not affect him; nor did open sheets of water,\r\nponds, lakes or rivers affect him. The nervous system of this man\r\nmust have been susceptible, since he was more sensibly affected by\r\nchange of weather and variations in the atmosphere than other persons;\r\notherwise he appeared healthy. A severe acute disorder had absolutely\r\nat one time deprived him of the faculty of perceiving water, and his\r\nsensibility in this respect did not return until three months after\r\nhis recovery; so that if he were sensitive, he could not be classed\r\namong the _sick sensitive_.\r\n\r\n\"But however remarkable these constitutional peculiarities may have\r\nbeen, there was in Bleton's case a more than usual distinctness in the\r\nbehavior of the divining rod. Unlike many _sourciers_, he did not\r\ngrasp it closely; he did not warm it in his hands; he did not prefer a\r\nyoung, hard branch, forked, newly plucked and full of sap. His custom\r\nwas to place horizontally on his forefinger and thumb a rod of any\r\nkind of wood (except elder), fresh or dry, not forked, only a little\r\ncurved or bent. A very straight rod failed to turn on its axis, but a\r\nbent rod turned on its axis with more or less rapidity, according to\r\nthe quantity of the water and the force of the current. Thouvenel\r\ncounted from thirty-five to eighty revolutions in a minute, and always\r\nnoted an exact proportion between the rotation of the rod and the\r\nconvulsive motions of Bleton. If these memoirs be critically examined,\r\nit will be found that the author experimented with full care to avoid\r\nevery source of fallacy. The natural motions of the rod on Bleton's\r\nfingers were backward, but as soon as he withdrew from the spring over\r\nwhich he stood, in any direction whatever, the rod, which instantly\r\nceased to turn, was subject to a new law, for at a determinate\r\ndistance from the spring an action of rotation in a direction contrary\r\nto the former one took place. This was invariable, and upon measuring\r\nthe distance of the spot where this retrograde phenomenon took place,\r\nfrom the spring, the depth could generally be found.\r\n\r\n\"I pass over an account of numerous experiments made by this\r\nintelligent and careful observer, pointing out the analogies of the\r\nknown phenomena of electricity and magnetism, by modifications\r\nresulting to the sensibility of Bleton, and the rotation of the rod by\r\nvarious ingenious electrical and magnetic trials suggested by the\r\ninventive sagacity of Thouvenel, in order to arrive at the curious\r\nanticipations of some of Professor Faraday's discoveries, by means of\r\nthe sensibility of Bleton and the invariable laws which regulated the\r\nrotation of the divining rod, when the experiments were made over\r\nplaces where various substances had been concealed under ground. It\r\nwas found that whether the trials were made in this manner, or over\r\nmasses of coal, subterraneous currents of water or metallic veins, the\r\ndivining rod indicated a determined sphere of electric activity, and\r\nwas, in fact, an _electrometrical rod_. 'Of all the phenomena\r\nrelating to the distinction of fossil bodies,' says Thouvenel, 'acting\r\nby their electrical emanations, doubtless the most surprising is this:\r\nupon the mines of iron, of whatever kind they may be, the rods\r\nsupported by the fingers of Bleton turned constantly on their axes\r\nfrom behind forward, as upon the mines of coal; while upon other\r\nmetallic mines, as upon other metals extracted from their mines, the\r\nrotary movement took place in the contrary direction, that is to say,\r\nfrom before backward. This circular movement, which never varies while\r\nBleton is in a perpendicular position over mines or upon metals,\r\npresents revolutions as rapid and as regular as the revolutions in the\r\ncontrary direction upon the mines of iron and coal.'\r\n\r\n\"The constitutional effects of spasms and convulsive twitchings took\r\nplace more or less in all the veins, but copper emanations excited\r\nvery strong and disagreeable spasmodic symptoms, accompanied by pains\r\nabout the heart, by flatulent movements in the bowels, and by abundant\r\neructations of air. On lead, there seemed to be less unpleasant\r\nconsequences, but stronger again on the mines of antimony. Having\r\npreviously determined that for Bleton, on all the metals except iron,\r\nthere existed a sphere of electric activity which propagated itself\r\ntoward the west, a great number of experiments were made, which always\r\nhad the same results. At the depth of two, three or four feet under\r\nground were buried gold, silver, copper, tin, lead and iron. The\r\nweight of each was only from five to eight pounds. In other similar\r\npits, pyrites of all kinds, sulphur, coal, resin, wax and lard were\r\nburied. All these different deposits were made at distances from each\r\nother in gardens or in open country, and they were so well covered\r\nover and concealed, that nothing could be perceived but private marks,\r\nto be known only by certain assistants. Over the resin, wax and lard,\r\nBleton experienced nothing. Over the coal, there was a decided effect,\r\nthe convulsive tremor of muscle was manifest, and the rod rotated from\r\nbehind forward. Over the iron, the same indications, but more\r\nenergetic. A feeble impression from the sulphur, but sufficient to\r\nestablish a difference between it and the two preceding; and the rod\r\nover the sulphur turned from before backward. Pyrites produced the\r\nsame rotation as sulphur, and a slight tendency of the electric sphere\r\ntoward the west. Gold and copper especially exhibited strongly this\r\nsingular tendency of the active electric emanations. Over silver, tin\r\nand lead, also, it was more remarkable. It extends itself more or less\r\nfrom the focus of the metals according to their depth and their mass.\r\nFor example, in describing a circle having a radius of three or four\r\nfeet from this focus, Bleton felt absolutely no action except on the\r\nline of the west. It was the same when, in proceeding from the\r\nvertical point of the focus, he successively traversed all the radii\r\nof the circle, or even if he went from all the points of the\r\ncircumference to proceed to the center. In these two inverse\r\nproceedings it was always only on the radii going westward, that his\r\nperson and the rods were affected by movements more or less intense,\r\naccording to the kinds of metal.\r\n\r\n\"It must, however, be admitted that the action of these metals\r\npresenting only the differences of greater or less in degree, either\r\nin the nervous and muscular impressions of the body or in the circular\r\nrevolutions of the rods constantly moved from before backward, these\r\ndifferences do not yield a certain means of distinguishing the five\r\nmetals one from the other. The object Thouvenel had in view was\r\nnevertheless fulfilled, for he had established the extent and the\r\ndetermination of a sphere of electric activity towards the west in\r\ncertain metals and on sulphur which does not exist in the same manner,\r\non iron, on coal, or on streams of water.\r\n\r\n\"To give a summary then of the relations of these phenomena to those\r\nestablished by Professor Faraday, it may be said that over iron mines,\r\nthe divining rod assumes a movement of rotation diametrically opposite\r\nto that which it exhibits over all other mines. When iron and other\r\nmetals are extracted from their ores and deposited under ground, the\r\nphenomenon occurs with the same distinction, that is to say, with the\r\niron it rotates towards the north. With all other metals submitted to\r\ntrial, its action is from east to west. The influence of the red\r\nmetals seems to be more energetic than that of the white. But with\r\nregard to this divining rod, let one condition be remarked--the\r\nrelation of the organic substance to another organic and living power\r\nof matter, to a human being in a certain susceptible state of nervous\r\nsystem. Thouvenel describes the symptoms which affected Bleton when he\r\nwas in the sphere of metallic action, and the rod becomes the\r\nsecondary part of a philosophical instrument composed of an\r\nimpressionable human being and a piece of stick.\r\n\r\n\"A highly respectable girl, the lady's maid of a very clever and\r\nintelligent friend of mine residing in Hertfordshire, offers, when she\r\nis mesmerized, a great many deeply interesting phenomena. She is as\r\nguileless and as good a being as can be met with, and is much beloved\r\nby her excellent and amiable mistress who has repeatedly addressed me\r\nin her case. If a piece of hazel stick or white thorn be presented to\r\nHarriet, she grasps it and sleeps mesmerically in less than a minute.\r\nThe sleep is at first very intense and deep, and then the stick is\r\nheld so firmly that the spasmodic state of the muscles renders it very\r\ndifficult for even a powerful bystander to turn it in her hand.\r\nHarriet P's impressionability was put to a very useful purpose. Her\r\nmistress heard that she had a practice of 'dowsing' for water, and\r\nwrites thus to a friend, July, 1845: 'We made a carious experiment\r\nhere, some days since, with Harriet P----. We have very bad water here\r\nand have long been unable to find a good spring. Mr. G. has in vain\r\ndug and dug for one. I proposed the divining rod; \"for\" said I, \"Dr.\r\nAshburner would not think it a foolish experiment.\" Harriet P. was\r\nwilling, so we went forth to a field the most likely one for a\r\nspring--Mr. and Mrs. G., myself, and two friends staying here. We put\r\nHarriet to sleep with the hazel stick. She grasped it so tightly we\r\nwere obliged to use the gold chain. She then held it only in one hand,\r\nand immediately began to walk, taking her own way. She went very\r\ncarefully for about twenty yards, then suddenly stopped as if she had\r\nbeen shot. Not a word was uttered by any one. We all looked on, and\r\nwere not a little surprised to see the rod slowly turn round until her\r\nhand was almost twisted backwards. It looked as if it must pain her;\r\nstill no one spoke. Suddenly she exclaimed, \"There! there! don't you\r\nsee the stick turn? The water is here, under my hand. I see, oh, I\r\nsee; let me look; don't speak to me; I like to look.\" \"How deep is the\r\nwater?\" said Mrs. G., speaking to Harriet's fingers. \"Oh, about three\r\nfeet; I can't quite tell, but it is here.\" In a moment, to our\r\nastonishment, she sank down on the grass, and took the stick again in\r\nher hands. We made a strange group around her, as we were all much\r\nastonished to see what we had come there to see. She seemed so like a\r\nwitch. We marked the place, and, after a few minutes, we awoke her. In\r\nthe evening she was again mesmerized to sleep, and we asked her what\r\nshe saw at the spring. \"Why, I saw water, water everywhere.\" \"Then,\"\r\nsaid I, \"how do you know where the spring is?\" \"Oh, because it goes\r\ntrinkle, trinkle, I know it is there.\" \"Why did you sit down?\" \"Why,\r\nbecause I was so giddy; it seemed as if all was water but the little\r\npiece of ground I stood upon. I saw so much water, all fresh, no sea.\r\nI tried to see the sea but could not; I could not at all.\" Mr. G.\r\ncaused a large hole to be dug, and just at the depth of three feet the\r\nwater was found. A brick well has been constructed, and there is a\r\ngood supply of excellent water. No one could doubt the action of the\r\nrod, it turned so evidently _of itself_ in her hand. Of course,\r\nwhen awake, Harriet knew nothing of the circumstance.'\"\r\n\r\nSo many and so various are the testimonies and the facts relating to\r\nthe divining rod, that it would be tedious to recite the hundreds of\r\nrespectable documents offered by those authors who have written on the\r\nsubject. A work by Tardy de Montravel, printed in 1781, entitled\r\n\"Memoire Physique et Medicinale sur la Baguette Divinatoire,\" abounds\r\nin testimonies of the truth of the same class of facts. One of the\r\nmost curious works on this subject, is a little book entitled \"Occult\r\nPhysics, or treatise on the Divining Wand and on its utility in the\r\ndiscovery of springs of water, mines, concealed treasures, thieves,\r\nand escaped murderers, with principles which explain the most obscure\r\nphenomena of Nature,\" by L. L. de Vallemont, Ph.D. This work,\r\nembellished with plates, illustrating the different kinds of divining\r\nrods with the various modes of holding them for use, appeared at the\r\nlatter part of the seventeenth century, and passed through several\r\neditions in France and Holland. It is remarkable for much curious\r\nliterary and historical learning, and for able statements of the\r\narguments which were used in the controversies rife at that period, on\r\nthe realities of the facts under consideration. It contains a curious\r\ncatalogue of a great number of mines discovered in France, by means of\r\nthe divining rod, made out by a German mineralogist employed for the\r\npurpose by the Cardinal de Richelieu.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n[_From Cyclopedia Americana._]\r\n\r\nDIVINING ROD.--A rod made with certain superstitions ceremonies,\r\neither single and curved, or with two branches like a fork, of wood,\r\nbrass or other metal.\r\n\r\nThe rod is held in a particular way, and if it bends towards one side,\r\nthose who use the rod believe it to be an indication that there is\r\ntreasure under the spot.\r\n\r\nSome publications respecting a man who, in quite recent times\r\npretended to be able to discover water and metals under the ground by\r\nhis feelings, attracted much attention.\r\n\r\nCampetti, an Italian, born at Gargnano, on Lake Garda, has attracted\r\nmuch attention in our time by pretending to be capable of ascertaining\r\nby his feelings the places where metals and water exist under ground.\r\n\r\nMany experiments seem to confirm his statements. The King of Bavaria\r\nsent for him in 1806, and he came to Munich, where the experiments\r\nwere renewed.\r\n\r\nThese experiments were chiefly made with pendulums of sulphurous\r\npyrites, which are said to vibrate if brought near to metals.\r\n\r\n_Rhabdomancy_ is the power considered by some as existing in\r\nparticular individuals, partly natural and partly acquired, of\r\ndiscovering things hid in the earth, especially metals, ores, and\r\nbodies of water, by a change in their perceptions, and likewise the\r\nart of aiding the discovery of these substances by the use of certain\r\ninstruments; for example, the divining rod.\r\n\r\nThat rhabdomancy, generally speaking, is little more than\r\nself-delusion, or intentional deception, is now the opinion of most\r\nnatural philosophers and physiologists. Still it has some champions.\r\nFrom the most remote periods, indications are found of the art of\r\ndiscovering veins of ore and water concealed in the bowels of the\r\nearth, by a direct perception of their existence.\r\n\r\nThe divining rod is held in the hand so that the curvature is inclined\r\noutward. If the person who holds the rod possesses the powers of\r\nrhabdomancy, and touches the metallic or any other magnetic substance,\r\nor comes near them, a slow, rotatory motion of the rod ensues in\r\ndifferent directions, according to particular circumstances; and, as\r\nin the other cases, no motion takes place without a direct or indirect\r\ncontact with a living person. In the South of France and Switzerland\r\nthis art is frequently made use of under the name of METALLOSCOPE\r\n(when discovering or feeling for metals,) and of HYDROSCOPE (when\r\ndiscovering or feeling for water).\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n[_From Chamber's Cyclopedia._]\r\n\r\nTHE DIVINING ROD--often called the Virgula Divina, the Baculus\r\nDivinatorius, the Caduceus, or Wand of Mercury, the Rod of Aaron,\r\netc.--is a forked branch, usually of hazel, sometimes of iron, or even\r\nbrass or copper, by which it has been pretended that minerals and\r\nwater have been discovered beneath the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe rod when suspended by the two prongs, sometimes between the balls\r\nof the thumbs, will distinctly indicate by a decided inclination, it\r\nis alleged, the spot over which the concealed mine or spring is\r\nsituated.\r\n\r\nMany men, even of some pretensions to scientific knowledge, have been\r\nbelievers in the occult power ascribed to the magic wand.\r\n\r\nAgricola, Sperlingius, and Kirchmayer, all believed in its\r\nsupernatural influence. So did Richelet, the author of the Dictionary.\r\nThe learned Morhoff remained in suspense, while Thouvenot and Pryce,\r\nin the latter part of the eighteenth century, gave ample records of\r\nits power.\r\n\r\nIn a work published by Dr. Herbert Mayo, in 1847 and 1851, entitled,\r\n\"On the Truth Contained in Popular Superstitions,\" he gave some\r\ncurious illustrations of the art, supposed to be possessed by one in\r\nforty of the Cornish miners. At Weilbach, in Nassau, he likewise met\r\nwith one Leebold, who, he says, possessed the power, but afterwards\r\nlost it.\r\n\r\nArthur Phippen, in 1853, published a pamphlet containing an account of\r\ntwo professional diviners, or \"dowsers.\" One of them, named Adams,\r\ngave remarkable indications of being able to detect water underground.\r\nHe not only was able to discover the particular spot where the water\r\nmight be found, he could even perceive a whole line of water running\r\nunderground.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n[_From Hartwig's Subterranean World._]\r\n\r\nAs far back as the eleventh century, the divining rod came into\r\npractice and found full credence in a superstitious age. A forked\r\nbranch of hazel tree, cut during a peculiar phase of the moon, was the\r\nmeans employed in Germany for the discovery of buried treasures, of\r\nveins of metals, of deposits of salt, or of subterranean sources.\r\n\r\nBut the miraculous rod did not indiscriminately show its power in\r\nevery hand. It was necessary to have been born in certain months,\r\nand soft and warm, or--according to modern expression, _magnetic_\r\nfingers were indispensable for handling it with effect.\r\n\r\nThe diviner possessing these qualifications took hold of the rod by\r\nits branches so that the stem into which they united was directed\r\nupwards.\r\n\r\nOn approaching the spot where the sought for treasure lay concealed,\r\nthe magical rod slowly turned towards it, until finally the stem had\r\nfully changed its position, pointed vertically downwards.\r\n\r\nTo increase the solemnity of the scene, the wily conjurers generally\r\ntraced magical circles, that were not to be passed, burnt strong\r\nsmelling herbs and spices, and uttered powerful charms, to disarm the\r\nenmity of the evil spirits that were supposed to guard the hidden\r\ntreasures.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n[_From American Cyclopedia._]\r\n\r\nDIVINING ROD.--The increase of knowledge has not yet expelled even\r\nfrom the educated portions of the United States all faith in the magic\r\nvirtues of this instrument.\r\n\r\nThere is a mystery in the hidden flow of subterranean courses of\r\nwater, and in the occurrence of deposits of valuable ores, which\r\nencourage a resort to mysterious methods for discovering them.\r\n\r\nIf the wise can point to no sure clue to them, the ignorant pretender\r\ndoes not fail to find one, which to many is all the more acceptable\r\nfor its extravagant pretensions and inexplicable nature. It is stated\r\nby a writer in the \"American Journal of Science,\" (Vol. 11, 1826,)\r\nthat the divining rod has been in frequent use since the eleventh\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nA work was published in France, in 1871, detailing six hundred\r\nexperiments made to ascertain the facts attributed to it, \"by which is\r\nunfolded,\" according to this work, \"their resemblance to the admirable\r\nand uniform laws of electricity and magnetism.\"\r\n\r\nThese sciences still continue to be appealed to in order to support in\r\nsome vague way phenomena which defy other means of explication.\r\n\r\nAs commonly used, the divining rod is a forked, slender stick of witch\r\nhazel; elastic twigs, however, of any sort, or even two sticks of\r\nwhale-bone fastened together at one end, do not appear to be rejected\r\nin the want of the hazel tree.\r\n\r\nOne branch of the twig is taken in each hand between the thumb and\r\nforefinger, the two ends pointing down. Holding the stick in this\r\nposition, the palms towards the face, the gifted operator passes over\r\nthe surface of the ground; and whenever the upper point of the stick\r\nbends over and points downward, there he affirms the spring or\r\nmetallic vein will be found.\r\n\r\nSome even pretend to designate the distance below the surface\r\naccording to the force of the movement, or according to the diameter\r\nof the circle over which the action is perceived, one rule being that\r\nthe depth is half the diameter of this circle; whence, the deeper the\r\nobject is, below the surface, the further is its influence exerted. It\r\nis observable that a rod so held will of necessity turn as the hands\r\nare closed more tightly upon it, though this has at first the\r\nappearance of serving to resist its motion. From the character of many\r\nwho use the rod and believe in it, it is also plain that this force is\r\nexerted without any intention or consciousness on their part, and that\r\nthey are themselves honestly deceived by the movement.\r\n\r\nOn putting the experiment to the test by digging, if water is found it\r\nproves the genuineness of the operation; if it is not found, something\r\nelse is, to which the effect is attributed, or the water which\r\nattracted the rod is sure to be met with if the digging is only\r\ncontinued deep enough. Some ingenuity is therefore necessary to expose\r\nthe deception.\r\n\r\nThe writer above referred to succeeded in showing the absurdity of the\r\noperation by taking the \"diviners\" over the same ground twice, the\r\nsecond time blindfolded, and each time marking the points designated\r\nby the rod. This, however, is a test to which they are not often\r\nwilling to subject their art.\r\n\r\nSome operators do not require a forked twig. There was, in 1857, and\r\nmay be still, within less than one hundred miles from New York, a man\r\nwho believed himself gifted in the use of the divining rod, and was\r\noccasionally sent for to go great distances, to determine the position\r\nof objects of value sunk in the lakes, of ores and of wells of water.\r\nHe carried several little cylinders of tin, but what they contained\r\nwas a secret. One had an attraction for iron, another for copper, a\r\nthird for water, etc. He had in his hand a little rattan cane, which\r\nhe used as not likely to excite the observation of those he met.\r\n\r\nTaking one of the cylinders out of his pocket he slipped the rattan\r\ninto a socket in its end, and holding in his hands the other end of\r\nthe stick, he set the contrivance bobbing up and down and around. That\r\nit was attracted and drawn towards any body of ore in the vicinity he\r\nwas evidently convinced.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n[_From Notes and Queries._]\r\n\r\nDIVINING ROD.--Divination by the rod or wand is mentioned in the\r\nprophecy of Ezekiel. Hosea, too, reproaches the Jews as being infected\r\nwith the like superstition: \"My people ask counsel at their stocks\r\nand their _staff_ declareth unto them.\" Chap. iv, 12. Not only the\r\nChaldeans used rods for divination, but almost every nation which has\r\npretended to that science, has practiced the same method. Herodotus\r\nmentions it as a custom of the Alani, and Tacitus of the old Germans.\r\nSee Cambridge's \"Scribleriad,\" book V, note on line 21.\r\n\r\nIn the manuscript \"Discourse on Witchcraft,\" 1705, written by Mr. John\r\nBell, page 41, I find the following account from Theophylact on the\r\nsubject of _rabdomanteia_ or rod-divination: \"They set up two\r\nstaffs, and, having whispered some verses and incantations, the staffs\r\nfell by the operation of dæmons. Then they considered which way each\r\nof them fell--forward or backward, to the right or left hand--and\r\nagreeably gave responses, having made use of the fall of their staffs\r\nfor their signs.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Henry, in his \"History of Great Britain,\" tells us (II, 550), that\r\nafter the Anglo-Saxons and Danes embraced the Christian religion, the\r\nclergy were commanded by the canons to preach very frequently against\r\n_diviners_, sorcerers, auguries, omens, charms, incantations, and\r\nall the filth of the wicked and dotages of the Gentiles.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is from \"Epigrams, etc.,\" published London,\r\n1651--_Virgula Divina_:\r\n\r\n    \"Some sorcerers do boast they have a rod,\r\n      Gathered with vowes and sacrifice,\r\n    And (borne about) will strangely nod\r\n      To hidden treasure where it lies;\r\n    Mankind is (sure) that rod divine,\r\n    For to the wealthiest (ever) they incline.\"\r\n\r\nThe earliest use made of the divining rod by the miners was for the\r\ndiscovery of the _lode_. So late as three years ago (1850), the\r\nprocess has been tried. The method of procedure was to cut the twig of\r\nan hazel or apple-tree of twelve months' growth, into a forked shape,\r\nand to hold this by both hands in a peculiar way, walking across the\r\nland until the twig bent, which was taken as an indication of the\r\nlocality of the lode. The person who generally practises this\r\ndivination boasts himself to be the seventh son of a seventh son. The\r\ntwig of hazel bends in his hands to the conviction of the miners that\r\nore is present; but then the peculiar manner in which the twig is\r\nheld, bringing muscular action to bear upon it, accounts for its\r\ngradual deflection, and the circumstance of the strata walked over\r\nalways containing ore gives a further credit to the process of\r\ndivination.\r\n\r\nThe vulgar notion still prevalent in the north of England of the\r\nhazel's tendency to a vein of lead ore, seam or stratum of coal, etc.,\r\nseems to be a vestige of this rod divination.\r\n\r\nThe _virgula divina_ or _baculus divinatorius_ is a forked branch in\r\nthe form of a Y, cut off an hazel stick, by means whereof people have\r\npretended to discover mines, springs, etc., underground. The method of\r\nusing it is this: the person who bears it, walking very slowly over\r\nthe places where he suspects mines or springs may be, the effluvia\r\nexhaling from the metals, or vapor from the water impregnating the\r\nwood, makes it dip or decline, which is the sign of a discovery.\r\n\r\nIn the _Living Library_ or _Historical Meditations_ we read: \"No man\r\ncan tell why forked sticks of hazill (rather than sticks of other\r\ntrees growing upon the very same places) are fit to shew the places\r\nwhere the veins of gold and silver are.\" See Lilly's History of his\r\nLife and Times, for a curious experiment (which he confesses, however,\r\nto have failed), to discover hidden treasure by the hazel rod.\r\n\r\nIn the _Gentleman's Magazine_, for February, 1752, xxii, 77, we\r\nread: \"M. Linnæus, when he was upon his voyage to Scania, hearing his\r\nsecretary highly extol the virtues of his divining rod, was willing to\r\nconvince himself of its insufficiency, and for that purpose concealed\r\na purse of one hundred ducats under a ranunculus which grew by itself\r\nin a meadow and bid the secretary find it if he could. The wand\r\ndiscovered nothing, and M. Linnæus's mark was soon trampled down by\r\nthe company who were present; so that when M. Linnæus went to finish\r\nthe experiment by fetching the gold himself, he was utterly at a loss\r\nwhere to seek it. The man with the wand assisted him and pronounced\r\nthat it could not lie the way they were going, but quite the contrary;\r\nso he pursued the direction of his wand and actually dug out the gold.\r\nM. Linnæus adds, that such another experiment would make a proselyte\r\nof him.\" We read in the same book for November, 1751, xxi, 507: \"So\r\nearly as Agricola, the divining rod was in much request, and has\r\nobtained great credit for its discovery where to dig for metals and\r\nsprings of water; for some years past its reputation has been on the\r\ndecline, but lately it has been revived by an ingenious gentleman who,\r\nfrom numerous experiments, hath good reason to believe its effects to\r\nbe more than imagination. He says that hazel and willow rods, he has\r\nby experience found, will actually answer, with all persons in a good\r\nstate of health, if they are used with moderation and at some distance\r\nof time, and after meals, when the operator is in good spirits. The\r\nhazel, willow and elm are all attracted by springs of water. Some\r\npersons have the virtue intermittently; the rod in their hands will\r\nattract one half hour and repel the next. The rod is attracted by all\r\nmetals, coals, amber and limestone, but with different degrees of\r\nstrength. The best rods are those from the hazel or nut tree, as they\r\nare pliant and tough and cut in the winter months. A shoot that\r\nterminates equally forked is to be met with--two single ones of a\r\nlength and size may be tied together by a thread and will answer as\r\nwell as the other.\"\r\n\r\nIn the supplement to the Athenian Oracle, p. 234, we read that \"the\r\nexperiment of a hazel's tendency 'to a vein' of lead ore is limited to\r\nSt. John Baptist's Eve, and that with an hazel of that same year's\r\ngrowth.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a treatise in French entitled, _La Phisique Occulte ou\r\nTraite de la Baguette Divinatoire_, et de son utilite pour la\r\ndecouverte des sources d'Eau, des Minieres, de Tresors caches, des\r\nVoleurs et des Meurtriers fugitifs: par M.

Seven or\r\neight years ago, I remember to have seen one of these, which I thought\r\nextremely beautiful and curious, in the house of an old woman at\r\nBeeralston, in Devonshire, of whom I would most gladly have purchased\r\nit; but she declined parting with it on any account, thinking it would\r\nbe unlucky to do so. Mr. Gostling, in the Antiquarian Repertory, ii,\r\n164, has some observations on this subject. He thinks the lituus or\r\nstaff, with the crook at one end, which the augurs of old carried as\r\nbadges of their profession and instruments in the superstitious\r\nexercise of it, was not made of metal but of the substance above\r\nmentioned. Whether, says he, to call it a work of art or nature may be\r\ndoubted: some were probably of the former kind; others, Hogarth, in\r\nhis Analysis of Beauty, calls _lusus naturæ_ found in plants of\r\ndifferent sorts, and in one of the plates of that work gives a\r\nspecimen of a very elegant one, a branch of ash. I should rather,\r\ncontinues he, style it a distemper or distortion of nature; for it\r\nseems the effect of a wound by some insect which, piercing to the\r\nheart of the plant with its proboscis, poisons that, while the bark\r\nremains uninjured and proceeds in its growth, but formed into various\r\nstripes, flatness and curves for the want of the support which nature\r\ndesigned it. The beauty, some of these arrive at, might well\r\nconsecrate them to the mysterious fopperies of heathenism, and their\r\nrarity occasions imitations of them by art. The pastoral staff of the\r\nChurch of Rome seems to have been formed from the vegetable litui,\r\nthough the general idea is that it is an imitation of the shepherd's\r\ncrook. The engravings given in the Antiquarian Repertory are of carved\r\nbranches of the ash.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n[_From Modern Magic, by M. Shele de Vere, published 1873._]\r\n\r\nThe relations in which some men stand to nature are sometimes so close\r\nas to enable them to make discoveries which are impossible to others.\r\n\r\nThis is, for instance, the case with persons who feel the presence of\r\nwaters or of metals. The former have, from time immemorial, generally\r\nused a wand, the so-called divining rod, which, according to Pliny,\r\nwas already known to the ancient Etruscans as a means for the\r\ndiscovery of hidden springs.\r\n\r\nAn Italian author, Amoretti, who has given special attention to this\r\nsubject, states that at least every fifth man is susceptible to the\r\ninfluence of water and metals, but this is evidently an over-estimate.\r\n\r\nIn recent times many persons have been known to possess this gift of\r\ndiscovering hidden springs or subterranean masses of water, and these\r\nhave but rarely employed an instrument.\r\n\r\nCatharine Beutler, of Thurgovia, in Switzerland, and Anna Maria\r\nBrugger, of the same place, were both so seriously affected by the\r\npresence of water that they fell into violent nervous excitement when\r\nthey happened to cross places beneath which, large quantities were\r\nconcealed, and became perfectly exhausted.\r\n\r\nIn France, a class of men, called _sourciers_, have for ages possessed\r\nthis instinctive power of perceiving the presence of water, and\r\nothers, like the famous Abbe Paramelle, have cultivated the natural\r\ngift till they were finally enabled, by a mere cursory examination of\r\na landscape, to ascertain whether large masses of water were hidden\r\nanywhere, and to indicate the precise spots where they might be found.\r\n\r\nWhy water and metals should almost always go hand in hand in\r\nconnection with this peculiar gift, is not quite clear; but the staff\r\nof Hermes, having probably the form of the divining rod was always\r\nrepresented as giving the command over the treasures of the earth, and\r\nthe Orphic Hymn (v. 527,) calls it--hence, the golden rod, producing\r\nwealth and happiness.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Aquæ Virga, the nymph of springs, had also a\r\ndivining rod in her hand, and Numa, inspired by a water-nymph,\r\nestablished the worship of waters in connection of that of the dead.\r\nFor here, also, riches and death seem to have entered into a strange\r\nalliance.\r\n\r\nDel Rio, in his _Disquisitiones Magicæ_, mentions thus the Rahuri\r\nof Spain--the lynx-eyed, as he translates the name--who were able, on\r\nWednesdays and Saturdays, to discover all the veins of metals or of\r\nwater beneath the surface, all hidden treasures and corpses in their\r\ncoffins.\r\n\r\nThere is at least one instance recorded, where a person possessed the\r\npower to see even more than the Rahuris. This was a Portuguese lady,\r\nPedegache, who first attracted attention by being able to discover\r\nsubterranean springs and their connections, a gift which brought her\r\ngreat honors after she had informed the king of all the various\r\nsupplies of water which were hidden near a palace which he was about\r\nto build. Shafts were sunk according to her directions, and not only\r\nwater was found but also various soils and stones which she had\r\nforetold would have to be pierced.\r\n\r\nShe also seems to have cultivated her talent, for we hear of her next\r\nbeing able to discover treasures, even valuable antique statues in the\r\ninterior of houses, and finally she reached such a degree of intuition\r\nthat she saw the inner parts of the human body, and pointed out their\r\ndiseases and defects.\r\n\r\nThe divining rod, originally a twig of willow or hazel, is often made\r\nof metal, and the impression prevails that in such cases an electric\r\ncurrent arising from the subterranean water or metals enters the\r\ndiviner's body by the feet, passes through him, and finally affects\r\nthe two branches of the rod, which represent opposite poles. It is\r\ncertain that when the electric current is interrupted, the power of\r\nthe divining rod is suspended.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n[_From Notes and Queries._]\r\n\r\nPerhaps, like many of your correspondents, I had imagined that the\r\nsupposed properties of the divining rod had been a discovery recently\r\nmade, either by the great American artist, Mr. Barnum, or by one of\r\n_Dii Minores_ of this country. To my mortification, however, I\r\nfind that it is \"as old as the hills,\" or at least contemporaneous\r\nwith the Sortes Virgilianæ, _et id genus omne_. I have before me\r\nthe works of Mr. Abraham Cowley, in two vols. 12 mo., London, 1681,\r\nand in one of his Pindarique Odes, addressed to Mr. Hobs, I find the\r\nfollowing lines:\r\n\r\n    To walk in ruines like vain ghosts, we love,\r\n    And with fond divining wands,\r\n    We search among the dead\r\n    For treasures buried.\r\n\r\nAnd to these lines is added the following note:\r\n\r\n\"Virgula Divina, or divining wand, is a two-forked branch of a hazel\r\ntree which is used for the finding out either of veins or hidden\r\ntreasures of gold or silver, and being carried about bends downwards\r\n(or rather is said to do so,) when it comes to the place where they\r\nlye.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the first edition of his _Mathematical Recreations_, Dr.\r\nHutton laughed at the divining rod. In the interval between that and\r\nthe second edition a lady made him change his note, by using one\r\nbefore him, at Woolwich. Hutton had the courage to publish the account\r\nof the experiment in his second edition, after the account he had\r\npreviously given. By a letter from Hutton to Bruce, printed in the\r\nmemoir of the former which the latter wrote, it appears that the lady\r\nwas Lady Milbanke.\"\r\n\r\n\"A Cornish lady informs me that the Cornish miners to this day use the\r\ndivining rod.\"\r\n\r\nHowever the pretended effect of the divining rod may be attributed to\r\nknavery and credulity by philosophers who will not take the trouble of\r\nwitnessing and investigating the operation, any one who will pay a\r\nvisit to the Mendip Hills, in Somersetshire, and the country around\r\ntheir base, may have abundant proof of the efficacy of it. Its success\r\nhas been very strikingly proved along the range of the Pennard Hills,\r\nalso, to the south of the Mendip. The faculty of discovering water by\r\nmeans of the divining rod is not possessed by every one, for indeed\r\nthere are but few who possess it in any considerable degree, or in\r\nwhose hands the motion of the rod, when passing over an underground\r\nstream, is very decided, and they who have it are quite unconscious of\r\ntheir capability until made aware of it by experiment.\r\n\r\nI saw the operation of the rod, or rather of a fork formed by the\r\nshoots of the last year, held in the hands of the experimenter by the\r\nextremities, with the angle projecting before him. When he came over\r\nthe spot beneath which the water flowed, the rod, which had before\r\nbeen perfectly still, writhed about with considerable force, so that\r\nthe holder could not keep it in its former position, and he appealed\r\nto the bystanders to notice that he had made no motion to produce this\r\neffect, and used every effort to prevent it. The operation was several\r\ntimes repeated with the same result, and each time under the close\r\ninspection of shrewd and doubting, if not incredulous observers. Forks\r\nof any kind of green wood served equally well, but those of dead wood\r\nhad no effect. The experimenter had discovered water, in several\r\ninstances, in the same parish (Pennard), but was perfectly unaware of\r\nhis capability till he was requested by his landlord to try. The\r\noperator had the reputation of a perfectly honest man, whose word\r\nmight be safely trusted, and who was incapable of attempting to\r\ndeceive any one--as indeed appeared by his open and ingenuous manner\r\nand conversation on this occasion. He was a farmer, and respected by\r\nall his neighbors. So general is the conviction of the efficacy of the\r\ndivining rod in discovering both water and the ores of calameni or\r\nzinc all over the Mendip, that the people are quite astonished when\r\nany doubt is expressed about it. The late Dr. Hutton wrote against the\r\npretension, as one of many instances of deception founded upon gross\r\nignorance and credulity, when a lady of quality, who herself possessed\r\nthe faculty, called upon him and gave him experimental proof, in the\r\nneighborhood of Woolwich, that water was discoverable by that means.\r\nThis, Dr. Hutton afterwards publicly acknowledged.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nAfter delivering my essay before the Civil Engineers' Club of the\r\nNorthwest, the following letter was forwarded to me by the secretary:\r\n\r\n    BROWNSVILLE, TENN.\r\n\r\n    GENTLEMEN:--I notice that at a meeting of your honorable Club, Mr.\r\n    Latimer read an essay upon the subject of the \"Divining Rod,\" and\r\n    seemed to be at a loss to know how to tell whether the rod's\r\n    movements pointed to or indicated any particular substance under\r\n    the earth. I am now seventy-three years of age, and have been\r\n    studying and experimenting with it since twenty years of age. I am\r\n    not satisfied what causes the motion of it in my hands, but by\r\n    experimenting, I can tell to a certainty whether I am over any\r\n    substance, either water or mineral, or whether it is sulphur, salt\r\n    or any other kind of water.\r\n\r\n    I am glad that investigation in this is being made by scientific\r\n    men, and hope some day it may profit man. For any information you\r\n    may want, address me at Brownsville, Tennessee.\r\n\r\n    Very respectfully,\r\n\r\n    HARRY SANGSTER.\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of this letter from Mr. Sangster, I wrote to him asking\r\nhim to explain to me upon what principle he could discover the\r\ndifference between metals and water, and between one kind of water and\r\nanother. To this I have received the following answer, just in time to\r\nadd it to this publication:\r\n\r\n    BROWNSVILLE, May 10, 1876.\r\n\r\n    C. LATIMER, ESQ., _Cleveland, Ohio_:\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:--Your favor of the 5th inst. is before me; also that of\r\n    the 15th ult. You must excuse me for not answering the latter\r\n    sooner, owing to ill health and other causes. I am glad to furnish\r\n    you all the information in my power relative to the matter in\r\n    question, because I would like to see it developed--as I believe\r\n    it will be eventually--into a tangible, practical and useful\r\n    science. The prejudice now prevailing against it will, in my\r\n    opinion, ere long be dispelled. It is impossible for me, in the\r\n    space of a letter, to give a full statement of my views, theory\r\n    and experience on the subject of finding the locality of metals,\r\n    minerals and water under the surface of the ground; but will\r\n    endeavor to answer the inquiry of your first letter as concisely\r\n    and explicitly as possible.\r\n\r\n    I understand fully the method of calculating the depth of water\r\n    beneath the surface. What you wish to know is, after the substance\r\n    is shown to exist beneath a certain point, whether it be mineral,\r\n    metal or water, and the kind, character and description of each.\r\n    As you are aware of the fact, the simple \"forked rod\" will\r\n    indicate the presence of either of these. Now, to tell which of\r\n    these it is, and the character of the same; if it be water, the\r\n    kind of water. This is my method of testing the same, whether it\r\n    be water, mineral or metal: It is on the principle of\r\n    _affinity_--the attraction that like substances have for each\r\n    other. After the rod indicates the particular spot, I take a\r\n    sponge and saturate it with ordinary drinking water, either from\r\n    spring or well, and put it on the top of the rod, and test it with\r\n    this. If the substance beneath be water, and the same kind of that\r\n    in the sponge, it will turn much stronger, and the demonstration\r\n    be more active and powerful. But, if the rod should not turn at\r\n    all, it will be some other substance, either mineral or metal. To\r\n    test the kind of water, after I am satisfied that it is water--to\r\n    discover, for instance, whether it be sulphur water, I dip my\r\n    sponge in that kind of water, and test as above. If the movement\r\n    of the rod be active and strong when this is done, the water below\r\n    will be that species of water. If salt water, dip the sponge in\r\n    that kind of water, and the result will be similar; and so on\r\n    through the whole catalogue of waters.\r\n\r\n    In regard to the metals. The tests are made in a similar manner.\r\n    After I discover by proper tests that it is a metal, which are as\r\n    follows: If it be metal or mineral, after the sponge is saturated\r\n    with water, the rod will not act at all. I then put a piece of\r\n    metal on the top of the rod; first, a small bit of iron. If there\r\n    is no movement of the rod at the spot already indicated, it is\r\n    safe to conclude that the substance is not of that nature; so I\r\n    continue the experiment with different kinds of metal--lead,\r\n    silver, copper, tin, gold, etc., until I find some one of these\r\n    that will cause the rod to turn and operate in a manner\r\n    sufficiently strong and satisfactory. The same method pertains to\r\n    the minerals. Of course, a great deal of the practical operations\r\n    of these various tests, will depend upon one's discretion and\r\n    judgment at the time they are made, which it is impossible to put\r\n    upon paper. This is but a general outline of the system.\r\n\r\n    If I can be of any further assistance to you in the investigation\r\n    of this subject, do not fail to let me know of it. Would be\r\n    pleased to hear from you at any and all times. Be sure and send me\r\n    your pamphlet.\r\n\r\n    Yours, respectfully,\r\n\r\n    HARRY SANGSTER.\r\n\r\nImmediately after receiving this letter, I made some experiments as\r\nfollows: I took a green, forked twig, and found that over iron\r\nwater-pipe, gas-pipe, and over a cistern of water, it turned down\r\nvigorously. I then took a wet rag and fastened it on top of the twig\r\nor rod. As Mr. Sangster testifies, I found it powerless over the iron\r\nwater-pipe and over the gas-pipe, but it turned rapidly over the\r\ncistern. I put a key on the end of the rod over the wet rag; then the\r\nrod turned over both iron pipes promptly. Again, I took off the rag\r\nand put the key on the rod, and walking to the cistern, found that\r\nthere was no movement. I took off the key and the rod turned\r\ninstantly. I have no doubt but that he is correct as regards other\r\nmetals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any one, after the perusal of these pages, is disposed to doubt the\r\nefficacy of the divining rod, he will find it at least difficult to\r\nexplain the coincidences between my experiences and those of the\r\nvarious persons presented in the foregoing pages--all confirming most\r\nfully conclusions reached by me, after many experiments made when\r\nquite alone. And, he must be even more eccentric than L'Homme à la\r\nBaguette, who does not find in the subject a treasure hidden, well\r\nworthy of his research.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that I can lay claim to no originality, or rather\r\nto no knowledge beyond that of the greater number of the parties\r\nmentioned, in regard to the fact of the discovery of minerals or\r\nwaters; but, I find myself in advance in two essentials. First, I\r\nabsolutely proved, by insulating myself on glass or India rubber\r\nsandals, that the electric emanations were cut off. Secondly, that\r\nthese emanations universally radiate at an angle of forty-five degrees\r\nfrom the horizontal, and thus the calculation of the depth below the\r\nsurface, is simply the solution of a mathematical problem.\r\n\r\nIn this theory of the invariable law of electric emanations, I have\r\nreceived the strongest confirmation in the perusal of Baron Von\r\nReichenbach's _Dynamics of Magnetism_. By numerous and varied\r\nexperiments, Reichenbach proved that from metals, and especially from\r\nmagnets, there is a constant emanation of electric flame upward, at an\r\nangle of forty-five degrees with the horizon. For a more serious study\r\nof the subject, I refer the reader to the work itself, which is full\r\nof curious and well authenticated experiences.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would paraphrase the words of my friend, the renowned Pedro\r\nGarcia: \"To thee, whomsoever thou art, who mayst have the genius to\r\ninvestigate and the courage to face wise fools, I predict a valuable\r\ndiscovery, which will benefit the human race.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
