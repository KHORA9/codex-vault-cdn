The\r\nviews then held would not explain many phenomena, and they failed in\r\nparticular in cosmogonic problems. The radiation pressure of light,\r\nwhich had not, so far, been heeded, seemed to give me the key to the\r\nelucidation of many obscure problems, and I made a large use of this\r\nforce in dealing with those phenomena in my treatise.\r\n\r\nThe explanations which I tentatively offered could, of course, not\r\nclaim to stand in all their detail; yet the scientific world received\r\nthem with unusual interest and benevolence. Thus encouraged, I tried\r\nto solve more of the numerous important problems, and in the present\r\nvolume I have added some further sections to the complex of explanatory\r\narguments concerning the evolution of the Universe. The foundation\r\nto these explanations was laid in a memoir which I presented to\r\nthe Academy of Sciences at Stockholm in 1900. The memoir was soon\r\nafterwards printed in the _Physikalische Zeitschrift_, and the subject\r\nwas further developed in my _Treatise of Cosmic Physics_.\r\n\r\nIt will be objected, and not without justification, that scientific\r\ntheses should first be discussed and approved of in competent circles\r\nbefore they are placed before the public. It cannot be denied that,\r\nif this condition were to be fulfilled, most of the suggestions on\r\ncosmogony that have been published would never have been sent to the\r\ncompositors; nor do I deny that the labor spent upon their publication\r\nmight have been employed for some better purpose. But several\r\nyears have elapsed since my first attempts in this direction were\r\ncommunicated to scientists. My suggestions have met with a favorable\r\nreception, and I have, during these years, had ample opportunity\r\ncarefully to re-examine and to amend my explanations. I therefore feel\r\njustified in submitting my views to a larger circle of readers.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the evolution of the Universe has always excited\r\nthe profound interest of thinking men. And it will, without doubt,\r\nremain the most eminent among all the questions which do not have any\r\ndirect, practical bearing. Different ages have arrived at different\r\nsolutions to this great problem. Each of these solutions reflected the\r\nstand-point of the natural philosophers of its time. Let me hope that\r\nthe considerations which I offer will be worthy of the grand progress\r\nin physics and chemistry that has marked the close of the nineteenth\r\nand the opening of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nBefore the indestructibility of energy was understood, cosmogony\r\nmerely dealt with the question how matter could have been arranged\r\nin such a manner as to give rise to the actual worlds. The most\r\nremarkable conception of this kind we find in Herschel’s suggestion\r\nof the evolution of stellar nebulæ, and in the thesis of Laplace\r\nconcerning the formation of the solar system out of the universal\r\nnebula. Observations more and more tend to confirm Herschel’s view.\r\nThe thesis of Laplace, for a long time eulogized as the flower of\r\ncosmogonic speculations, has more and more had to be modified. If we\r\nattempt, with Kant, to conceive how wonderfully organized stellar\r\nsystems could originate from absolute chaos, we shall have to admit\r\nthat we are attacking a problem which is insoluble in that shape. There\r\nis a contradiction in those very attempts to explain the origin of the\r\nUniverse in its totality, as Stallo[1] emphasizes: “The only question\r\nto which a series of phenomena gives legitimate rise relates to their\r\nfiliation and interdependence.” I have, therefore, only endeavored to\r\nshow how nebulæ may originate from suns and suns from nebulæ; and I\r\nassume that this change has always been proceeding as it is now.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Stallo: _Concepts and Theories of Modern Physics_.\r\n    London, 1900, p. 276.]\r\n\r\nThe recognition of the indestructibility of energy seemed to accentuate\r\nthe difficulties of the cosmogonic problems. The theses of Mayer and\r\nof Helmholtz, on the manner in which the Sun replenishes its losses of\r\nheat, have had to be abandoned. My explanation is based upon chemical\r\nreactions in the interior of the Sun in accordance with the second law\r\nof thermodynamics. The theory of the “degradation” of energy appeared\r\nto introduce a still greater difficulty. That theory seems to lead to\r\nthe inevitable conclusion that the Universe is tending towards the\r\nstate which Clausius has designated as “_Wärme Tod_” (heat death),\r\nwhen all the energy of the Universe will uniformly be distributed\r\nthrough space in the shape of movements of the smallest particles. That\r\nwould imply an absolutely inconceivable end of the development of the\r\nUniverse. The way out of this difficulty which I propose comes to this:\r\nthe energy is “degraded” in bodies which are in the solar state, and\r\nthe energy is “elevated,” raised to a higher level, in bodies which are\r\nin the nebular state.\r\n\r\nFinally, I wish to touch upon one cosmogonical question which\r\nhas recently become more actual than it used to be. Some kind of\r\n“spontaneous generation,” origination of life from inorganic matter,\r\nhad been acquiesced in. But just as the dreams of a spontaneous\r\ngeneration of energy—_i.e._, of a _perpetuum mobile_—have been\r\ndispelled by the negative results of all experiments in that direction,\r\njust in the same way we shall have to give up the idea of a spontaneous\r\ngeneration of life after all the repeated disappointments in this field\r\nof investigation. As Helmholtz[2] says, in his popular lecture on the\r\ngrowth of the planetary system (1871): “It seems to me a perfectly just\r\nscientific procedure, if we, after the failure of all our attempts to\r\nproduce organisms from lifeless matter, put the question, whether life\r\nhas had a beginning at all, or whether it is not as old as matter, and\r\nwhether seeds have not been carried from one planet to another and have\r\ndeveloped everywhere where they have fallen on a fertile soil.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: Helmholtz, _Populäré Wissenschaftliche Vorträge_.\r\n    Braunschweig, 1876, vol. iii., p. 101.]\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis is called the hypothesis of panspermia, which I have\r\nmodified by combining it with the thesis of the radiation pressure.\r\n\r\nMy guiding principle in this exposition of cosmogonic problems has been\r\nthe conviction that the Universe in its essence has always been what\r\nit is now. Matter, energy, and life have only varied as to shape and\r\nposition in space.\r\n\r\n                                                          THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n  STOCKHOLM, December, 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         WORLDS IN THE MAKING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\n                  VOLCANIC PHENOMENA AND EARTHQUAKES\r\n\r\n\r\n                       The Interior of the Earth\r\n\r\nThe disasters which have recently befallen the flourishing settlements\r\nnear Vesuvius and in California have once more directed the attention\r\nof mankind to the terrific forces which manifest themselves by volcanic\r\neruptions and earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThe losses of life which have been caused in these two last instances\r\nare, however, insignificant by comparison with those which various\r\nprevious catastrophes of this kind have produced. The most violent\r\nvolcanic eruption of modern times is no doubt that of August 26 and\r\n27, 1883, by which two-thirds of the island of Krakatoa, 33 square\r\nkilometres (13 square miles) in area, situated in the East Indian\r\nArchipelago, were blown into the air. Although this island was itself\r\nuninhabited, some 40,000 people perished on that occasion, chiefly by\r\nthe ocean wave which followed the eruption and which caused disastrous\r\ninundations in the district. Still more terrible was the destruction\r\nwrought by the Calabrian earthquake of February and March, 1783, which\r\nconsisted of several earthquake waves. The large town of Messina\r\nwas destroyed on February 5th, and the number of people killed by\r\nthis event has been estimated at 100,000. The same region, especially\r\nCalabria, has, moreover, frequently been visited by disastrous\r\nearthquakes—again in 1905 and 1907. Another catastrophe upon which\r\nhistory dwells, owing to the loss of life (not less than 90,000),\r\nwas the destruction of the capital of Portugal on November 1, 1755.\r\nTwo-thirds of the human lives which this earthquake claimed were\r\ndestroyed by a wave 5 m. in height rushing in from the sea.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 1.—Vesuvius, as seen from the Island of\r\n    Nisida, in moderate activity]\r\n\r\nVesuvius is undoubtedly the best studied of all volcanoes. During\r\nthe splendor of Rome this mountain was quite peaceful—known as an\r\nextinct volcanic cone so far as history could be traced back. On the\r\nextraordinarily fertile soil about it had arisen big colonies of such\r\nwealth that the district was called Great Greece (Græcia Magna). Then\r\ncame, in the year 79 A.D., the devastating eruption which destroyed,\r\namong others, the towns of Herculaneum and Pompeii. The volumes of gas,\r\nrushing forth with extreme violence from the interior of the earth,\r\npushed aside a large part of the volcanic cone whose remnant is now\r\ncalled Monte Somma, and the falling masses of ashes, mixed with streams\r\nof lava, built up the new Vesuvius. This mountain has repeatedly\r\nchanged its appearance during later eruptions, and was provided with\r\na new cone of ashes in the year 1906. The outbreak of the year 79\r\nwas succeeded by new eruptions in the years 203, 472, 512, 685, 993,\r\n1036, 1139, 1500, 1631, and 1660, at quite irregular intervals. Since\r\nthat time Vesuvius has been in almost uninterrupted activity, mostly,\r\nhowever, of a harmless kind, so that only the cloud of smoke over its\r\ncrater indicated that the internal glow was not yet extinguished. Very\r\nviolent eruptions took place in the years 1794, 1822, 1872, and 1906.\r\n\r\nOther volcanoes behave quite differently from these violent volcanoes,\r\nand do hardly any noteworthy damage. Among these is the crater-island\r\nof Stromboli, situated between Sicily and Calabria. This volcano has\r\nbeen in continuous activity for thousands of years. Its eruptions\r\nsucceed one another at intervals ranging from one minute to twenty\r\nminutes, and its fire serves the sailors as a natural light-house. The\r\nforce of this volcano is, of course, unequal at different periods.\r\nIn the summer of 1906 it is said to have been in unusually violent\r\nactivity. Very quiet, as a rule, are the eruptions of the great\r\nvolcanoes on Hawaii.\r\n\r\nForemost among the substances which are ejected from volcanoes is water\r\nvapor. The cloud floating above the crater is, for this reason, the\r\nsurest criterion of the activity of the volcano. Violent eruptions\r\ndrive the masses of steam up into the air to heights of 8 km. (5\r\nmiles), as the illustrations (Figs. 1 to 4) will show.\r\n\r\nThe height of the cloud may be judged from the height of Vesuvius, 1300\r\nmetres (nearly 4300 ft.) above sea-level. The illustration on page 4\r\n(Fig. 2) is a reproduction of a drawing by Poulett Scrope, representing\r\nthe Vesuvius eruption of the year 1822. There seems to have been no\r\nwind on this day; the masses of steam formed a cloud of a regular\r\nshape which reminds us of a pine-tree. According to the description of\r\nPlinius, the cloud noticed at the eruption of Vesuvius in the year 79\r\nmust have been of the same kind. When the air is not so calm the cloud\r\nassumes a more irregular shape (Fig. 3). Clouds which rise to such\r\nelevations as we have spoken of are distinguished by strong electric\r\ncharges. The vivid flashes of lightning which shoot out of the black\r\nclouds add to the terror of the awful spectacle.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 2.—Eruption of Vesuvius in 1882. (After a\r\n    contemporaneous drawing by Poulett Scrope)]\r\n\r\nThe rain which pours down from this cloud is often mixed with ashes\r\nand is as black as ink. The ashes have a color which varies between\r\nlight-gray, yellow-gray, brown, and almost black, and they consist\r\nof minute spherules of lava ejected by the force of the gases and\r\nrapidly congealed by contact with the air. Larger drops of lava harden\r\nto volcanic sand—the so-called “lapilli” (that is, little stones),\r\nor to “bombs,” which are often furrowed by the resistance offered by\r\nthe air, and turn pear-shaped. These solid products, as a rule, cause\r\nthe greatest damage due to volcanic eruptions. In the year 1906 the\r\nweight of these falling masses (Fig. 4) crushed in the roofs of houses.\r\nA layer of ashes 7 m. (23 ft.) in thickness buried Pompeii under a\r\nprotective crust which had covered it up to days of modern excavations.\r\nThe fine ashes and the muddy rain clung like a mould of plaster to the\r\ndead bodies. The mud hardened afterwards into a kind of cement, and as\r\nthe decomposition products of the dead bodies were washed away, the\r\nmoulds have provided us with faithful casts of the objects that had\r\nonce been embedded in them. When the ashes fall into the sea, a layer\r\nof volcanic tuffa is formed in a similar manner, which enshrines the\r\nanimals of the sea and algæ. Of this kind is the soil of the Campagna\r\nFelice, near Naples. Larger lumps of solid stones with innumerable\r\nbubbles of gases float as pumice-stone on the sea, and are gradually\r\nground down into volcanic sand by the action of the waves. The floating\r\npumice-stone has sometimes become dangerous or, at any rate, an\r\nobstacle to shipping, through its large masses; that was, at least, the\r\ncase with the Krakatoa eruption of 1883.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 3.—Eruption of Vesuvius in 1872. (After a\r\n    photograph.)]\r\n\r\nAmong the gases which are ejected in addition to water vapor, carbonic\r\nacid should be mentioned in the first instance; also vapors of\r\nsulphur and sulphuretted hydrogen, hydrochloric acid, and chloride of\r\nammonium, as well as the chlorides of iron and copper, boric acid, and\r\nother substances. A large portion of these bodies is precipitated on\r\nthe edges of the volcano, owing to the sudden cooling of the gases.\r\nThe more volatile constituents, such as carbonic acid, sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen, and hydrochloric acid, may spread over large areas, and\r\ndestroy all living beings by their heat and poison. It was these gases,\r\nfor example, which caused the awful devastation at St. Pierre, where\r\n30,000 human lives were destroyed on May 8, 1902, by the eruption of\r\nMont Pelée. The ejection of hydrogen gas, which, on emerging from the\r\nlava, is burned to water by the oxygen of the air, has been observed in\r\nthe crater of Kilauea.\r\n\r\nThe ashes of the volcanoes are sometimes carried to vast distances\r\nby the air currents—_e.g._, from the western coast of South America\r\nto the Antilles; from Iceland to Norway and Sweden; from Vesuvius\r\n(1906) to Holstein. Best known in this respect is the eruption of the\r\nKrakatoa, which drove the fine ashes up to an elevation of 30 km. (18\r\nmiles). The finest particles of these ashes were slowly carried by\r\nthe winds to all parts of the earth, where they caused, during the\r\nfollowing two years, the magnificent sunrises and sunsets which were\r\nspoken of as “the red glows.” This glow was also observed in Europe\r\nafter the eruption of Mont Pelée. The dust of Krakatoa further supplied\r\nthe material for the so-called “luminous clouds of the night,” which\r\nwere seen in the years 1883 to 1892 floating at an elevation of about\r\n80 km. (50 miles), and hence illuminated by the light of the sun long\r\nafter sunset.\r\n\r\nThe crater of Kilauea, on the high volcano of Mauna Loa, in\r\nHawaii—this volcano is about of the same height as Mont Blanc—has\r\nexcited special interest. The crater forms a large lake of lava having\r\nan area of about 12 sq. km. (nearly 5 sq. miles), which, however,\r\nvaries considerably with time. The lava boiling at red glow is\r\nconstantly emitting masses of gas under slight explosions, spurting\r\nout fiery fountains to a height of 20 m. (65 ft.) into the air. Here\r\nand there lava flows out from crevices in the wall of the crater down\r\nthe slope of the mountain, until the surface of the lake of lava\r\nhas descended below these cracks. As a rule, this lava is of a thin\r\nfluid consistency, and it spreads, therefore, rather uniformly over\r\nlarge areas. Of a similar kind are also the floods of lava which are\r\nsometimes poured over thousands of square kilometres on Iceland. The\r\nso-called Laki eruption of the year 1783 was of a specially grand\r\nnature. Though occurring in an uninhabited district, it did a great\r\namount of damage. In the more ancient geological periods, especially in\r\nthe Tertiary age, similar sheets of lava of vast extensions have been\r\nspread over England and Scotland (more than 100,000 sq. km., roughly,\r\n40,000 sq. miles); over Deccan, in India, 400,000 sq. kms. (150,000\r\nsq. miles), up to heights of 2000 m. (6500 ft.); and over Wyoming,\r\nYellowstone Park, Nevada, Utah, Oregon, and other districts of the\r\nUnited States, as well as over British Columbia.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 4.—Photograph of Vesuvius, 1906. Chiefly\r\n    clouds of ashes]\r\n\r\nIn other cases the slowly ejected lava is charged with large volumes of\r\ngases, which escape when the lava congeals and burst it up into rough,\r\nunequal blocks, forming the so-called block lava (Fig. 5). The streams\r\nof lava can likewise produce terrible devastation when they descend\r\ninto inhabited districts; on account of their slow motion, they rarely\r\ncause loss of life, however.\r\n\r\nWhere the volcanic activity gradually lessens or ceases, we can still\r\ntrace it by the exhalations of gas and the springs of warm water which\r\nwe find in many districts where, during the Tertiary age, powerful\r\nvolcanoes were ejecting their streams of lava. To this class belong\r\nthe famous geysers of Iceland, of Yellowstone Park (Fig. 6), and\r\nof New Zealand; also the hot springs of Bohemia, so highly valued\r\ntherapeutically (_e.g._, the Karlsbad Sprudel); the Fumaroli of Italy,\r\nGreece, and other countries, exhaling water vapor; the Mofettæ, with\r\ntheir exhalations of carbonic acid (of frequent occurrence in the\r\ndistrict of the Eifel and on both sides of the middle Rhine, in the\r\nDogs Grotto near Naples, and in the Valley of Death in Java); the\r\nSolfatara, exhaling vapors of sulphur—sulphuretted hydrogen and\r\nsulphur dioxide (they are found near Naples on the Phlegræan Fields\r\nand in Greece); as well as many of the so-called mud volcanoes,\r\nwhich eject mud, salt water, and gases (as a rule, carbonic acid and\r\nhydrocarbons)—for example, the mud volcanoes near Parma and Modena, in\r\nItaly, and those near Kronstadt, in Transylvania.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 5.—Block lava on Mauna Loa]\r\n\r\nThe extinct volcanoes, of which some, like the Aconcagua, 6970 m.\r\n(22,870 ft.), in South America, and the Kilimanjaro, in Africa, 6010\r\nm. (19,750 ft.), rank among the highest mountains, are exposed to a\r\nrapid destruction by the rain, because they consist largely of loose\r\nmaterials—volcanic ashes with interposed layers of lava. Where these\r\nlava streams expand gradually, they protect the ground underneath from\r\nerosion by water, and in this way proper cuts are formed on the edges\r\nof the lava streams, passing through the old volcano and through the\r\nsedimentary strata at deeper levels.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 6.—The Excelsior Geyser in Yellowstone\r\n    Park, U. S. A. Remnant of powerful volcanic activity in the\r\n    Tertiary age]\r\n\r\nThe old volcano of Monte Venda, near Padua, affords an interesting\r\nexample of this type. We can observe there how the sedimentary\r\nlimestone has been changed by the lava, which was flowing over it, into\r\nmarble to a depth of about 1 m. (3 ft.) Sometimes the limestone which\r\nis lying over the lava has also undergone the same transformation,\r\nwhich would indicate that lava has not only been flowing above the edge\r\nof the crater, but has also forced itself out on the sides through\r\nthe fissures between two layers of limestone. Massive subterranean\r\nlava streams of this kind are found in the so-called lakkolithes of\r\nUtah and in the Caucasus. There the superior layers have been forced\r\nupward by the lava pressing from below; the lava froze, however,\r\nbefore it reached the surface of the earth, where it might have formed\r\na volcano. Quite a number of granites, the so-called batholithes,\r\nchiefly occurring in Norway, Scotland, and Java, are of similar origin.\r\nOccasionally it is only the core of congealed lava that has remained of\r\nthe whole volcano. These cores, which originally filled the pipe of the\r\ncrater, are frequent in Scotland and in North America, where they are\r\ndesignated “necks” (Fig. 7).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 7.—Mato Tepee in Wyoming, U. S. A. Typical\r\n    volcanic “Neck”]\r\n\r\nThe so-called cañons of the Colorado Plateau, with their almost\r\nvertical walls, are the results of the erosive action of rivers. A\r\ndrawing by Dutton shows a wall of this kind more than 800 m. (2600 ft.)\r\nin height, through four fissures of which lava streams have forced\r\ntheir way up to the surface (Fig. 8). Over one of these fissures\r\na small cone of volcanic ashes is still visible, while the cones\r\nwhich probably overtopped the three other fissures have been washed\r\naway, so that the veins end in small “necks.” Evidently a very fluid\r\nlava—strong percentages of magnesia and of oxide of iron render the\r\nlava more fluid than an admixture of silicic acid, and the fluidity\r\nis further increased by the presence of water—has been forced into\r\nthe fissures which were already present, and has reached the surface\r\nof the earth before it froze. The driving force behind them must have\r\nbeen pretty strong; else the lava streams could not have attained the\r\nnecessary velocity of flow.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 8.—Clefts filled with lava and volcanic\r\n    cone of ashes, Torowheap Cañon, Plateau of Colorado. Diagram.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Krakatoa was blown into the air in 1883 half of the\r\nvolcano remained behind. This half clearly shows the section of the\r\ncone of ashes, which has been but very slightly affected by the\r\ndestructive action of the water. We find there in the central part the\r\nlight-colored stopper of lava in the volcano pipe, and issuing from it\r\nmore light-colored beds of lava, between which darker strata of ashes\r\ncan be seen.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of volcanoes over the surface of the earth is marked\r\nby striking regularities. Almost all the volcanoes are situated near\r\nthe shores of the sea. A few are found in the interior of East Africa;\r\nbut they are, at any rate, near the Great Lakes of the equatorial\r\nregions. The few volcanoes which are supposed to be situated in Central\r\nAsia must be regarded as doubtful. We miss, however, volcanoes on\r\nsome sea-coasts, as in Australia and along the long coast-lines of\r\nthe Northern Arctic Ocean to the north of Asia, Europe, and America.\r\nVolcanoes occur only where great cracks occur in the crust of the earth\r\nalong the sea-coast. Where such fissures are found, but where the sea\r\nor large inland lake basins are not near—as, for instance, in the\r\nAustrian Alps—we do not meet with any volcanoes; such districts are,\r\nhowever, renowned for their earthquakes.\r\n\r\nSince ancient ages the belief has been entertained that the molten\r\nmasses of the interior of the earth find an outlet through the\r\nvolcanoes. Attempts have been made to estimate the depth of the hearths\r\nof volcanoes, but very different values have been deduced. Thus, the\r\nhearth under the volcano of Monte Nuovo, which was thrown up in the\r\nyear 1538 on the Phlegræan Fields, near Naples, has been credited with\r\ndepths varying from 1.3 km. to 60 km. (1 mile to 40 miles); for the\r\nKrakatoa, estimates of more than 50 km. (30 miles) have been made. All\r\nthese calculations are rather aimless; for the volcanoes are probably\r\nsituated on folds of the earth-crust, through which the fluid mass (the\r\nmagma) rushes forth in wedges from the interior of the earth, and it\r\nwill presumably be very difficult to say where the hearth of magma ends\r\nand where the volcanic pipe commences. The Kilauea gives the visitor\r\nthe impression that he is standing over an opening in the crust of the\r\nearth, through which the molten mass rushes forth directly from the\r\ninterior of the earth. (Fig. 9.)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 9.—The Kilauea Crater on Hawaii]\r\n\r\nAs regards the earth-crust, we know from observations in bore-holes\r\nmade in different parts of the world that the temperature increases\r\nrather rapidly with the depth, on an average by about thirty degrees\r\nCent. per kilometre (about 1.6° F. per 100 feet). It must be remarked,\r\nhowever, that the depth of our deepest bore-holes hardly exceeds 2\r\nkm. (Paruchowitz, in Silesia, 2003 m., or 6570 ft.; Schladebach,\r\nnear Merseburg, Prussian Saxony, 1720 m.). If the temperature should\r\ngo on increasing at the rate of 30 degrees Cent. for each further\r\nkilometre, the temperature at a depth of 40 kilometres should attain\r\ndegrees at which all the common rocks would melt. But the melting-point\r\ncertainly rises at the same time as the pressure. The importance of\r\nthis circumstance was, however, much exaggerated when it was believed\r\nthat for this reason the interior of the earth might possibly be solid.\r\nTammann has shown by direct experiments that the temperature of fusion\r\nonly rises up to a certain pressure, and that it begins to decrease\r\nagain on a further increase of pressure. The depths indicated above are\r\ntherefore not quite correct. If we assume, however, that other kinds of\r\nrock behave like diabase—the melting-point of which, according to the\r\ndeterminations of Barus, rises by 1° Cent. for each 40 atmospheres of\r\npressure corresponding to a depth of 155 m.—we should conclude that\r\nthe solid crust of the earth could not have a greater thickness than 50\r\nor 60 km. (40 miles). At greater depths we should therefore penetrate\r\ninto the fused mass. On account of its smaller density the silicic acid\r\nwill be concentrated in the upper strata of the molten mass, while\r\nthe basic portions of the magma, which are richer in iron oxide, will\r\ncollect in the lower strata, owing to their greater density.\r\n\r\nThis magma we have to picture to ourselves as an extremely viscid\r\nliquid resembling asphalt. The experiments of Day and Allen show that\r\nrods, supported at their ends, of 30 × 2 × 1 mm. of different minerals,\r\nlike the feldspars microcline and albite, could retain their shape for\r\nthree hours without curving noticeably, although their temperature was\r\nabout a hundred degrees above their melting-point, and although they\r\nappeared completely fused, or, more correctly, completely vitrified\r\nwhen taken out of the furnace. These molten silicates behave very\r\ndifferently from other liquids like water and mercury, with which we\r\nare more accustomed to deal.\r\n\r\nThe motion and diffusion in the magma, and especially in the very\r\nviscous and sluggish acid portions of the upper strata, will therefore\r\nbe exceedingly small, and the magma will behave almost like a solid\r\nbody, like the minerals of the experiments of Day and Allen. The magmas\r\nof volcanoes like Etna, Vesuvius, and Pantellaria may, therefore, have\r\nquite different compositions, as we should conclude from their lavas\r\nwithout our being forced to believe, with Stübel, that these three\r\nhearths of volcanoes are completely separated, though not far removed\r\nfrom one another. In the lava of Vesuvius a temperature of 1000 or 1100\r\ndegrees has been found at the lower extremity of the stream. From the\r\noccurrence in the lava of certain crystals like leucite and olivin,\r\nwhich we have reason to assume must have been formed before the lava\r\nleft the crater, it has been concluded that the lava temperature cannot\r\nhave been higher than 1400 degrees before it left the volcanic pipe.\r\n\r\nIt would, however, be erroneous to deduce from the temperature of the\r\nlava of Vesuvius that the hearth of the volcano must be situated at a\r\ndepth of approximately 50 kilometres. Most likely its depth is much\r\nsmaller, perhaps not even 10 kilometres. For there, as everywhere where\r\nvolcanoes occur, the crust of the earth is strongly furrowed, and the\r\nmagma will just at the spots where we find volcanoes come much nearer\r\nto the surface of the earth than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe importance of water for the formation of volcanoes probably lies\r\nin the fact that, in the neighborhood of cracks under the bottom of\r\nthe sea, the water penetrates down to considerable depths. When the\r\nwater reaches a stratum of a temperature of 365 degrees—the so-called\r\ncritical temperature of water—it can no longer remain in the liquid\r\nstate. That would not prevent, however, its penetrating still farther\r\ninto the depths, in spite of its gaseous condition. As soon as the\r\nvapor comes in contact with magma, it will eagerly be absorbed by the\r\nmagma. The reason is that water of a temperature of more than 300\r\ndegrees is a stronger acid than silicic acid; the latter is therefore\r\nexpelled by it from its compounds, the silicates, which form the main\r\nconstituents of the magma. The higher the temperature, the greater the\r\npower of the magma to absorb water. Owing to this absorption the magma\r\nswells and becomes at the same time more fluid. The magma is therefore\r\npressed out by the action of a pressure which is analogous to the\r\nosmotic pressure by virtue of which water penetrates through a membrane\r\ninto a solution of sugar or salt. This pressure may become equivalent\r\nto thousands of atmospheres, and this very pressure would raise the\r\nmagma up the volcanic pipe even to a height of 6000 m. (20,000 feet)\r\nabove the sea-level. As the magma is ascending in the volcanic pipe\r\nit is slowly cooled, and its capacity for binding water diminishes\r\nwith falling temperature. The water will hence escape under violent\r\nebullition, tearing drops and larger lumps of lava with it, which fall\r\ndown again as ashes or pumice-stone. After the lava has flown out of\r\nthe crater and is slowly cooling, it continues to give off water,\r\nbreaking up under the formation of block lava (see Fig. 5). If, on the\r\nother hand, the lava in the crater of the volcano is comparatively\r\nat rest, as in Kilauea, the water will escape more slowly; owing to\r\nthe long-continued contact of the surface layer of lava with the air,\r\nlittle water will remain in it, the water being, so to say, removed by\r\naeration, and the lava streams will therefore, when congealing, form\r\nmore smooth surfaces.\r\n\r\nIn some cases volcanoes have been proved (Stübel and Branco) not to\r\nbe in connection with any fractures in the crust of the earth. That\r\nholds, for instance, for several volcanoes of the early Tertiary age\r\nin Swabia. We may imagine that the pressure produced by the swelling\r\nof the magma became so powerful as to be able to break through the\r\nearth-crust at thinner spots, even in the absence of previous fissures.\r\n\r\nIf, in our consideration, we follow the magma farther into the depths,\r\nwe shall not find any reason for assuming that the temperature will not\r\nrise farther towards the interior of the earth. At depths of 300 or\r\n400 km. (250 miles) the temperature must finally attain degrees such\r\nthat no substance will be able to exist in any other state than the\r\ngaseous. Within this layer the interior of the earth must, therefore,\r\nbe gaseous. From our knowledge of the behavior of gases at high\r\ntemperatures and pressures, we may safely conclude that the gases in\r\nthe central portions of the earth will behave almost like an extremely\r\nviscid magma. In certain respects they may probably be compared to\r\nsolid bodies; their compressibility, in particular, will be very small.\r\n\r\nWe might think that we could not possibly learn anything concerning\r\nthe condition of those strata. Earthquakes have, however, supplied us\r\nwith a little information. Such gaseous masses must fill by far the\r\ngreatest part of the earth, and they must have a very high specific\r\ngravity; for the average density of the earth is 5.52, and the outer\r\nstrata, the ocean and the masses of the surface which are known to us,\r\nhave smaller densities. The ordinary rocks possess a density ranging\r\nfrom 2.5 to 3. It must, therefore, be assumed that the materials of\r\nthe innermost portions of the earth must be metallic, and Wiechert,\r\nin particular, has advocated this view. Iron will presumably form the\r\nchief constituent of this gas of the central earth. Spectrum analysis\r\nteaches us that iron is a very important constituent of the sun. We\r\nknow, further, that the metallic portions of the meteorites consist\r\nessentially of iron; and finally terrestrial magnetism indicates that\r\nthere must be large masses of iron in the interior of the earth.\r\nWe have also reason to believe that the native iron occurring in\r\nnature—_e.g._, the well-known iron of Ovifak, in Greenland—is of\r\nvolcanic origin. The materials in the gaseous interior of the earth\r\nwill, owing to their high density, behave in chemical and physical\r\nrespects like liquids. As substances like iron will, also at very high\r\ntemperatures, have a far higher specific gravity than their oxides,\r\nand these again have a higher gravity than their silicates, we have to\r\nassume that the gases in the core of the earth will almost exclusively\r\nbe metallic, that the outer portions of the core will contain\r\nessentially oxides, and those farther out again mostly silicates.\r\n\r\nThe fused magma will, on penetrating in the shape of batholithes\r\ninto the upper layers, probably be divided into two portions, of\r\nwhich one, the lighter and gaseous, will contain water and substances\r\nsoluble in it; while the other, heavier portion, will essentially\r\nconsist of silicates with a lower percentage of water. The more fluid\r\nportion, richer in water, will be secreted in the higher layers, will\r\npenetrate into the surrounding sedimentary strata, especially into\r\ntheir fissures, and will fill them with large crystals, often of\r\nmetallurgical value—_e.g._, of the ores of tin, copper, and other\r\nmetals, while the water will slowly evaporate through the superposed\r\nstrata. The more viscid and sluggish mass of silicates, on the other\r\nhand, will congeal, thanks to its great viscosity, to glass, or, when\r\nthe cooling is very slow, to small crystals.\r\n\r\nWe now turn to earthquakes. No country has been absolutely spared by\r\nearthquakes. In the districts bounding upon the Baltic, and especially\r\nin northern Russia, they have, however, been of a quite harmless type.\r\nThe reason is that the earth-crust there has been lying undisturbed for\r\nlong geological epochs and has never been fractured. The comparatively\r\nsevere earthquake which shook the west coast of Sweden on October 23,\r\n1904, to an unusually heavy degree, without, however, causing any\r\nnoteworthy damage (a few chimneys were knocked over), was caused by a\r\nfault of relatively pronounced character for those districts in the\r\nSkager-Rack—a continuation of the deepest fold in the bottom of the\r\nNorth Sea, the so-called Norwegian Trough, which runs parallel to the\r\nNorwegian coast. In Germany, the Vogtland and the districts on both\r\nsides of the middle Rhine have frequently been visited by earthquakes.\r\nOf other European countries, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, and the Balkan\r\nPeninsula, as well as the Karst districts of Austria, have often\r\nsuffered from earthquakes.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 10.—Chief earthquake centres, according to\r\n    the British Association Committee]\r\n\r\nAccording to the committee appointed by the British Association for the\r\ninvestigation of earthquakes—a committee which has contributed a great\r\ndeal to our knowledge of these great natural phenomena—earthquakes of\r\nsome importance emanate from certain centres which have been indicated\r\non the subjoined map (Fig. 10). The most important among these regions\r\ncomprises Farther India, the Sunda Isles, New Guinea, and Northern\r\nAustralia; it is marked on the map by the letter F. From this district\r\nhave emanated in the six-year period 1899-1904 no fewer than 249\r\nearthquakes, which have been recorded in many observatories far removed\r\nfrom one another. This earthquake centre F is closely related to the\r\none marked E, in Japan, from which 189 earthquakes have proceeded. Next\r\nto this comes the extensive district K with 174 earthquakes, comprising\r\nthe most important folds in the crust of the Old World, including\r\nthe mountain chains from the Alps to the Himalaya. This district is\r\ninteresting, because it has been disturbed by a great many earthquakes,\r\nalthough it is almost entirely situated on the Continent. After that\r\nwe have the districts A, B, C, with 125, 98, and 95 earthquakes. They\r\nare situated near lines of fracture in the earth-crust along the\r\nAmerican coast of the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. District D,\r\nwith 78 earthquakes, is similarly situated. The three last-mentioned\r\ndistricts, B, C, D, as well as G, between Madagascar and India, with\r\n85 earthquakes, all seem to be surpassed by the district H in the\r\neastern Atlantic, with its 107 earthquakes. These latter are, however,\r\nrelatively feeble, and we owe their accurate records probably to the\r\ncircumstances that a great many earthquake observatories are situated\r\nwithin the immediate surroundings of this district. The same may be\r\nsaid of the district I, or Newfoundland, which is not characterized\r\nby many earthquakes, and of the district J, between Iceland and\r\nSpitzbergen, with 31 and 19 earthquakes respectively. The last on\r\nthe list used to be the district L, situated about the South Pole,\r\nwith only eight earthquakes. This small number is probably merely\r\ndue to the want of observatories in those parts of the earth. Another\r\ndistrict, M, has finally been added, which extends to the southwest\r\nfrom New Zealand. No fewer than 75 intense earthquakes were recorded\r\nbetween March 14 and November 23, 1903, by the Discovery Expedition, in\r\n70° southern latitude and 178° eastern longitude.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes commonly occur in swarms or groups. Thus, more than 2000\r\nshocks were counted on Hawaii in March, 1868. During the earthquakes\r\nwhich devastated the district of Phokis, in Greece, in 1870-73, shocks\r\nsucceeded one another for a long time at intervals of three seconds.\r\nDuring the whole period of three and a half years about half a million\r\nshocks were counted, and, further, a quarter of a million subterranean\r\nreports which were not accompanied by noticeable concussions. Yet of\r\nall these shocks only about 300 did noteworthy damage, and only 35\r\nwere considered worth being reported in the newspapers. The concussion\r\nof October 23, 1904, belonged to a group which lasted from October\r\n10 to October 28, and in which numerous small tremors were noticed,\r\nespecially on October 24 and 25. The earthquake of San Francisco\r\ncommenced on April 18, 1906, at 5 hrs. 12 min. 6 sec. A.M. (Pacific\r\nOcean time), and ended at 5 hrs. 13 min. 11 sec, lasting therefore 1\r\nminute and 5 seconds. Twelve smaller shocks succeeded in the following\r\nhour. Before 6 hrs. 52 min. P.M., nineteen further concussions were\r\ncounted, and various smaller shocks succeeded in the following days.\r\n\r\nWith such groups of earthquakes weaker tremors usually precede the\r\nviolent destructive shocks and give a warning. Unfortunately this\r\nis not always so, and no warning was given by the earthquakes which\r\ndestroyed Lisbon in 1755 and Caracas in 1812, nor by those which\r\ndevastated Agram in 1880, nor, finally, in the case of the San\r\nFrancisco disaster. A not very severe earthquake without feebler\r\nprecursors befell Ischia in 1881, while the violent catastrophe\r\nwhich devastated this magnificent island in 1883 was heralded by\r\nseveral warnings. As in San Francisco and Chili in 1906, less violent\r\nconcussions generally succeed the destructive shocks. Earthquakes like\r\nthat of Lisbon in 1755, consisting of a single shock, are very rare.\r\n\r\nThe violent concussions often produce large fissures in the ground.\r\nSuch were noticed in several places at San Francisco. One of the\r\nlargest fissures known, that of Midori, in Japan, was caused by the\r\nearthquake of October 20, 1891. It left a displacement of the ground\r\nranging up to 6 m. (20 ft.) in the vertical and 4 m. (13 ft.) in the\r\nhorizontal direction. This crack had a length of not less than 65 km.\r\n(40 miles). Extensive fissures were also formed by the earthquakes of\r\nCalabria, in 1783, at Monte San Angelo, and in the sandstones of the\r\nBálpakrám Plateau in India, in 1897. In mountainous districts falls\r\nof rock are a frequent consequence of the formation of fissures and\r\nearthquakes. A large number of rocks fell in the neighborhood of Delphi\r\nduring the Phokian earthquake. On January 25, 1348, an earthquake\r\nsent down a large portion of Mount Dobratsch (in the Alps of Villach,\r\nin Carinthia, which is now much frequented by tourists) and buried\r\ntwo towns and seventeen villages. The earthquake of April 18, 1906,\r\nin California started from a crack which extends from the mouth of\r\nAlder Creek, near Point Arena, running parallel with the coast-line\r\nmostly inland, then entering the sea near San Francisco, and turning\r\nagain inland between Santa Cruz and San José, finally proceeding _via_\r\nChittenden up to Mount Pinos, a distance of about 600 km. (400 miles),\r\nin the direction of N. 35° W. to S. 35° E. Along this crack the two\r\nmasses of the earth have been displaced so that the ground situated\r\nto the southwest of the fissure has been moved by about 3 m. (10\r\nft.), and in some spots even by 6 m. (20 ft.) towards the northwest.\r\nIn some localities in Sonoma and Mendocino counties the southwestern\r\npart has been raised, but nowhere by more than 1.2 m. (4 ft.). This is\r\nthe longest crack which has ever been noticed in connection with an\r\nearthquake.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 11.—Clefts in Valentia Street, San\r\n    Francisco, after the earthquake of 1906]\r\n\r\nThe earthquake over, the ground does not always return to its\r\noriginal position, but remains in a more or less wavy condition. This\r\ncan most easily be observed in districts where streets or railways\r\ncross the ground. It is reported, for instance, that the track of\r\nthe tramway-lines in Market Street, the chief thoroughfare of San\r\nFrancisco, formed large wavelike curves after the earthquake.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of the displacements in the interior of the earth\r\nand of the formation of fissures, river courses are changed, springs\r\nbecome exhausted, and new springs arise. That was the case, for\r\ninstance, in California in 1906. The ground water often rushes out\r\nwith considerable violence, tearing with it sand and mud and stones,\r\nand piling them up, occasionally forming little craters (Fig. 12).\r\nExtensive floods may also be caused on such occasions. By such a flood\r\nthe ancient Olympia was submerged under a layer of river sand which for\r\nsome time preserved from destruction the ancient Greek masterpieces\r\nof art—among them the famous statue of Hermes. The floods afterwards\r\nreceded, and the treasures of ancient Olympia could be excavated.\r\n\r\nLike the natural water channels and arteries in the interior of the\r\nearth, water mains are displaced by the concussions. The direct damage\r\ncaused by the floods is often less important than the damage due to the\r\nimpossibility of extinguishing the fires which follow the destruction\r\nof the buildings. It was the fires that did most of the enormous\r\nmaterial damage in the destruction of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nStill greater devastation is wrought by the ocean waves thrown up by\r\nearthquakes. We have already referred to the flood of Lisbon in 1755,\r\nwhich was felt on the western coast of Norway and Sweden. Another\r\nwave, in 1510, devoured 109 mosques and 1070 houses in Constantinople.\r\nAnother wave, again, invaded Kamaïshi, in Japan, on June 15, 1896,\r\nswept away 7600 houses and killed 27,000 people.\r\n\r\nWe have repeatedly alluded to the disastrous flood-wave of Krakatoa of\r\n1883. This wave traversed the whole of the Indian Ocean, passing to the\r\nCape of Good Hope and Cape Horn, and travelled round half the globe\r\nafterwards. Even more remarkable was the aerial wave, which spread like\r\nan explosion wave.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 12.—Sand craters and fissures, produced\r\n    by the Corinth earthquake of 1861. In the water, branches of\r\n    flooded trees]\r\n\r\nWhile the most violent cannonades are rarely heard for more than\r\n150 km. (95 miles)—in a single case at a distance of 270 km. (170\r\nmiles)—the eruption of Krakatoa was heard at Alice Springs, at a\r\ndistance of 3600 kilometres, and on the island of Rodriguez, at almost\r\n4800 km. (3000 miles). The barographs of the meteorological stations\r\nfirst marked a sudden rise and then a decided sinking of the air\r\npressure, succeeded by a few smaller fluctuations. These air pulses\r\nwere repeated in some places as many as seven times. We may therefore\r\nassume that the aerial wave passed these places three times in the one\r\ndirection, and three times in the other, travelling round the earth.\r\nThe velocity of propagation of this wave was 314.2 m. (1030 ft.) per\r\nsecond, corresponding to a temperature of -27° Cent. (17° F.) which\r\nprevails at an altitude of about 8 km. (5 miles) above the earth’s\r\nsurface, at which altitude this wave may have travelled.\r\n\r\nWithin the last decade a peculiar phenomenon (leading to what is\r\ndesignated variation of latitudes) has been studied. The poles of\r\nthe axis of the earth appear to move in a very irregular curve about\r\ntheir mean axis. The movement is exceedingly small. The deviation of\r\nthe North Pole from its mean position does not amount to more than\r\n10 m. (about 33 ft.). It has been believed that these motions of\r\nthe North Pole are subject to sudden fluctuations after unusually\r\nviolent earthquakes, especially when such concussions follow at rapid\r\nintervals. That would give us, perhaps more than any other observation,\r\nan idea of the force of earthquakes, since they would appear to be able\r\nto disturb the equilibrium of the whole mass of our globe.\r\n\r\nA severely felt effect of earthquakes, though most people perhaps\r\npay little attention to it, is the destruction of submarine cables.\r\nThe gutta-percha sheaths of cables are frequently found in a fused\r\ncondition, suggesting volcanic eruptions under the bottom of the sea.\r\nWe take care now to avoid earthquake centres in laying telegraphic\r\ncables. Their positions have been ascertained by the most modern\r\ninvestigations (see Fig. 10).\r\n\r\nPeople have always been inclined to look for a connection between\r\nearthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The connection is unquestionable in\r\na large number of violent earthquakes. In order to establish it, the\r\nabove-mentioned committee of the British Association has compiled the\r\nfollowing table of the history of the earthquakes of the Antilles:\r\n\r\n    1692.—Port Royal, Jamaica, destroyed by an earthquake; land\r\n    sinking into the sea. Eruption on St. Kitts.\r\n\r\n    1718.—Terrible earthquake on St. Vincent, followed by an\r\n    eruption.\r\n\r\n    1766-67.—Great shocks in northeastern South America, in Cuba,\r\n    Jamaica, and the Antilles. Eruption on Santa Lucia.\r\n\r\n    1797.—Earthquake in Quito, loss of 40,000 lives. Concussions\r\n    in the Antilles, eruption on Guadeloupe.\r\n\r\n    1802.—Violent shocks in Antigua. Eruption on Guadeloupe.\r\n\r\n    1812.—Caracas, capital of Venezuela, totally destroyed by\r\n    earthquake. Violent shocks in the Southern States of North\r\n    America, commencing on November 11, 1811. Eruptions on St.\r\n    Vincent and Guadeloupe.\r\n\r\n    1835-36.—Violent concussions in Chili and Central America.\r\n    Eruption on Guadeloupe.\r\n\r\n    1902.—April 19. Violent shocks, destroying many towns of\r\n    Central America. Mont Pelée, on Martinique, in activity.\r\n    Eruption on May 3. Submarine cables break, sea recedes. Renewed\r\n    violent movements of the sea on May 8, 19, 20. Eruption on St.\r\n    Vincent, cable destroyed on May 7. Violent eruption of Mont\r\n    Pelée on May 8. Destruction of St. Pierre. Numerous smaller\r\n    earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThis table distinctly marks the restless state of affairs in that part\r\nof the earth, and how quiet and safe matters are comparatively in old\r\nEurope, especially in the north. Some parts of Central America are so\r\npersistently visited by earthquakes that one of them, Salvador, has\r\nbeen christened “Schaukelmatte.” It is not saying too much to assert\r\nthat the earth is there incessantly trembling. Other districts which\r\nare very frequently visited are the Kuriles and Japan, as well as the\r\nEast Indian islands. In all these countries the crust of the earth has\r\nbeen broken and folded within comparatively recent epochs (chiefly in\r\nthe Tertiary age) by numerous fissures, and their compression is still\r\ngoing on.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 13.—Earthquake lines in lower Austria]\r\n\r\nThe smaller earthquakes, of which not less than 30,000 are counted in\r\nthe course of a year, do not stand in any closer relation to volcanic\r\neruptions. This is also the case for a number of large earthquakes,\r\namong which we have to count the San Francisco earthquake.\r\n\r\nIt is assured with good reason that earthquakes are often produced\r\nat the bottom of the sea, where there is a strong slope, by slips of\r\nsedimentary strata which have been washed down from the land into the\r\nsea in the course of centuries. Milne believes that the seaquake of\r\nKamaïshi of June 15, 1896, was of this character. Concussions may even\r\nbe promoted by the different loading of the earth resulting from the\r\nfluctuations in the pressure of the air above it.\r\n\r\nSmaller, though occasionally rather violent, earthquakes are not\r\ninfrequent in the neighborhood of Vienna. On the map (Fig. 13) we see\r\nthree lines. The line A B is called the thermal line, because along it\r\na number of hot springs, the thermæ of Meidling, Baden, Vöslau, etc.,\r\nare located, which are highly valued; the other line B C is called the\r\nKamp line, because it is traversed by the river Kamp; and the third B F\r\nis called the Mürz line, after the river Mürz. The main railway-track\r\nbetween Vienna and Bruck follows the valleys of A B and E F.\r\n\r\nThese lines, which probably correspond to large fissures in the\r\nearth-crust, are known as sources of numerous earthquakes. The district\r\nabout Wiener Neustadt, where the three lines intersect, is often shaken\r\nby violent earthquakes; some of their dates have been marked on the map.\r\n\r\nThe curve which is indicated by the letters X X on the map marks the\r\noutlines of an earthquake which started on January 3, 1873, from both\r\nsides of the Kamp line. It is striking to see how the earthquake spread\r\nin the loose ground of the plain between St. Pölten and Tulln, while\r\nthe masses of rock situated to the northwest and southeast formed\r\nobstacles to the propagation of the earthquake waves.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 14.—Library building of Leland Stanford\r\n    Junior University, in California, after the earthquake of 1906.\r\n    The photograph shows the great strength of iron structures in\r\n    comparison to the strength of brickwork. The effect of the\r\n    earthquake on wooden structures can be seen in Fig. 11]\r\n\r\nSimilar conclusions have been deduced from the study of the spreading\r\nof the waves which destroyed Charleston, South Carolina, in 1886.\r\nTwenty-seven lives were destroyed by this shock. It was the most\r\nterrible earthquake that ever visited the United States before the year\r\n1906. In the Charleston concussion the Alleghany Mountains proved a\r\npowerful bar against the further propagation of the shocks, which all\r\nthe more easily travelled in the loose soil of the Mississippi Valley.\r\nIn San Francisco, likewise, the worst devastation fell upon those parts\r\nof the town which had been built upon the loose, partly made ground\r\nin the neighborhood of the harbor, while the buildings erected on the\r\nfamous mountain ridges of San Francisco suffered comparatively little\r\ndamage, in so far as they were not reached by the destructive fires. As\r\nregards the destructive effects of the earthquake in San Francisco, the\r\nbuilding-ground of that city has been divided into four classes (the\r\nfirst is the safest, the last the most unsafe)—namely: 1. Rocky soil.\r\n2. Valleys situated between rocks and filled up by nature in the course\r\nof time. 3. Sand-dunes. 4. Soil created by artificial filling up. This\r\nlatter soil “behaved like a semiliquid jelly in a dish,” according to\r\nthe report of the Earthquake Commission.\r\n\r\nFor similar reasons the sky-scrapers, constructed of steel on deep\r\nfoundations, stood firmest. After them came brick houses, with\r\nwell-joined and cemented walls on deep foundations. The weakness of\r\nwooden houses proved mainly due to the poor connection of the beams,\r\na defect which might easily be remedied. The superiority of the steel\r\nstructure will be apparent from the illustrations (Figs. 11 and 14).\r\n\r\nThe spots situated just over the crack, of which we spoke on page 25,\r\nsuffered the most serious damage. Next to them, devastation befell\r\nespecially localities which, like Santa Rosa, San José, and Palo Alto\r\nwith Leland Stanford Junior University, are situated on the loose soil\r\nof the valley, whose deepest portions are covered by the bay of San\r\nFrancisco. The splendidly endowed California University, in Berkeley,\r\nand the famous Lick Observatory, both erected on rocky ground,\r\nfortunately escaped without any notable damage.\r\n\r\nThe map sketch (Fig. 15) by Suess represents the earthquake lines of\r\nSicily and Calabria. These districts have, as mentioned before, been\r\ndevastated by severe earthquakes, of which the most terrible occurred\r\nin the year 1783, and again in 1905 and 1907. They have also been the\r\nscene of many smaller concussions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.—Earthquake lines in the Tyrrhenian depression]\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the Tyrrhenian Sea—between Italy, Sicily, and\r\nSardinia—has been lowered in rather recent ages and is still sinking.\r\nWe notice on the map five dotted lines, corresponding to cracks in\r\nthe crust of the earth. These lines would intersect in the volcanic\r\ndistrict of the Lipari Islands. We further see a dotted circular arc\r\ncorresponding to a fissure which is regarded as the source of the\r\nCalabrian earthquakes of 1783, 1905, and 1907. The earth-crust behaved\r\nsomewhat after the manner of a windowpane which was burst by a heavy\r\nimpact from a point corresponding to the Island of Lipari. From this\r\npoint radiate lies of fracture, and fragments have been broken off from\r\nthe earth-crust by arc-shaped cracks. The volcano Etna is situated on\r\nthe intersection of the radial and circular fissures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.—Seismogram recorded at Shide, Isle of Wight,\r\non August 31, 1898]\r\n\r\nIn recognition of the high practical importance of earthquake\r\nobservations, seismological stations have in recent days been erected\r\nin many localities. At these observatories the earthquakes are recorded\r\nby pendulums whose styles draw lines on tapes of paper moved by\r\nclock-work. As long as the earth is quiet the drawn line is straight.\r\nWhen earthquakes set in, the line passes into a wavy curve. As long\r\nas the movement of the paper is slow, the curve merely looks like a\r\nwidened straight line. The subjoined illustration (Fig. 16) represents\r\na seismogram taken at the station of Shide, on the Isle of Wight, on\r\nAugust 31, 1898. The earthquake recorded originated in the Centre G,\r\nin the Indian Ocean. The origin has been deduced from the moments of\r\narrival of the different waves at different stations. We notice on the\r\nseismogram a faint widening of the straight line at 20 hrs. 5 min. 2\r\nsec. (8 hrs. 5 min. 2 sec. P.M.). The amplitude of the oscillations\r\nthen began to widen, and the heaviest concussions were noticed at 20\r\nhrs. 36 min. 25 sec., and 20 hrs. 42 min. 49 sec., after which the\r\namplitudes slowly decreased with smaller shocks. The first shock of\r\n20 hrs. 5 min. 2 sec. is called the preliminary tremor. This tremor\r\npasses through the interior of the earth at a velocity of propagation\r\nof 9.2 km. (5-3/4 miles) per second. It would require twenty-three\r\nminutes to pass through the earth along a diameter. The tremor is\r\nvery feeble, which is ascribed to the extraordinarily great friction\r\ncharacteristic of the strongly heated gases which are confined in the\r\ninterior of the earth. The principal violent shock at 20 hrs. 36 min.\r\n25 sec. was caused by a wave travelling through the solid crust of the\r\nearth. The intensity of this shock is much less impaired than that of\r\nthe just-mentioned tremor, and it travels with the smaller velocity of\r\nabout 3.4 km. (2.1 miles) along the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nThe velocity of propagation of concussion pulses has been calculated\r\nfor a mountain of quartz, in which it would be 3.6 km. (2.2 miles) per\r\nsecond, very nearly the same as the last-mentioned figure. We should\r\nexpect this, since the firm crust of the earth consists essentially\r\nof solid silicates—_i.e._, compounds of quartz endowed with similar\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nMeasured at small distances from the origin, the velocity of\r\npropagation of the wave appears smaller, and the first preliminary\r\ntremor is frequently not observed. The velocity may be diminished to\r\n2 km. (1-1/4 miles) per second. The reason is that the pulse partly\r\ndescribes a curve in the more solid portions of the crust, and partly\r\npasses through looser strata, through which the wave travels at a much\r\nslower rate than in firm ground; for instance, at 1.2 km. through loose\r\nsandstones, at 1.4 km. through the water of the ocean, and at 0.3\r\nkm. through loose sand. We recognize that it should be possible to\r\ncalculate the distance between the point of observation and the origin\r\nof the earthquake from the data relating to the arrivals of the first\r\npreliminary tremor and of the principal shock of maximum amplitude. The\r\nviolent shock is sometimes repeated after a certain time, though with\r\ndecreased intensity. It has often been observed that this secondary,\r\nless violent, shock seems to have travelled all round the earth _via_\r\nthe longest road between the origin and the point of observation,\r\njust like one portion of the aerial waves in the eruption of Krakatoa\r\n(compare page 27). The velocity of propagation of this secondary shock\r\nis the same as that of the principal shock.\r\n\r\nMilne has deduced from his observations that, when the line joining the\r\norigin of the earthquake and the point of observation does not at its\r\nlowest level descend deeper than 50 km. below the surface of the earth,\r\nthe pulse will travel undivided through the solid crust of the earth.\r\nFor this reason we estimate the thickness of the solid crust at 50 km.\r\nThe value is in almost perfect agreement with the one which we had (on\r\npage 16) derived from the increase of temperature with greater depths.\r\nIt should further be mentioned, perhaps, that the density of the earth\r\nin the vicinity has been determined from pendulum observation, and that\r\nthis density seems to be rather variable down to the depths of 50 or 60\r\nkm., but to become more uniform at greater depths. These 50 or 60 km.\r\n(31 or 37 miles) would belong to the solid crust of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe movement of earthquake shocks through the earth thus teaches us\r\nthat the solid earth-crust cannot be very thick, and that the core of\r\nthe earth is probably gaseous. The similar conclusions, to which these\r\nvarious considerations had led us, may therefore come very near the\r\ntruth. A careful study of seismograms may, we hope, help us to learn\r\nmore about the central portions of the earth, which at first sight\r\nappear to be absolutely inaccessible to scientific research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\n THE CELESTIAL BODIES, IN PARTICULAR THE EARTH, AS ABODES OF ORGANISMS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no more elevating spectacle than to contemplate the sky with\r\nits thousands of stars on a clear night. When we send our thoughts\r\nto those lights glittering in infinite distance, the question forces\r\nitself upon us, whether there are not out there planets like our own\r\nthat will sustain organic life. How little interest do we take in a\r\nbarren island of the Arctic Circle, on which not a single plant will\r\ngrow, compared to an island in the tropics which is teeming with life\r\nin its most wonderful variety! The unknown worlds occupy our minds much\r\nmore when we may fancy them inhabited than when we have to regard them\r\nas dead masses floating about in space.\r\n\r\nWe have to ask ourselves similar questions with regard to our own\r\nlittle planet, the earth. Was it always covered with verdure, or was\r\nit once sterile and barren? And if that be so, what are the conditions\r\nunder which the earth can fulfil its actual part of harboring\r\norganic life? That “the earth was without form” in the beginning is\r\nunquestionable. It does not matter whether we assume that it was once\r\nall through an incandescent liquid, which may be the most probable\r\nassumption, or that it was, as Lockyer and Moulton think, formed by the\r\naccumulation of meteoric stones which became incandescent when arrested\r\nin their motion.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the earth probably consists of a mass of gas encased\r\nwithin a shell which is solid on the outside and remains a viscid\r\nliquid on the inner side. We presume with good reason that the earth\r\nwas originally a mass of gas separated from the sun, which is still in\r\nthe same state. By radiation into cold space the sphere of gas which,\r\non the whole, would behave as our sun does now, would gradually lose\r\nits high temperature, and finally a solid crust could form on its\r\nsurface. Lord Kelvin has calculated that it would not require more than\r\none hundred years before the temperature of this crust would sink to\r\n100°. Supposing, even, that Kelvin’s calculations should not quite be\r\nconfirmed, we may yet maintain that not many thousands of years would\r\nhave elapsed from the time when the earth assumed its first crust at\r\nabout 1000° till the age when this temperature had fallen below 100°\r\n(212° F.). Living beings certainly could not exist so long, since\r\nthe albumen of the cells would at once coagulate at the temperature\r\nof boiling water, like the white of an egg. Yet it has been reported\r\nthat some of the hot springs of New Zealand contain algæ, although at\r\na temperature of over 80°. When I went to Yellowstone Park to inquire\r\ninto the correctness of this statement, I found that the algæ existed\r\nonly at the edge of the hot springs, where the temperature did not\r\nexceed 60° (140° F.). The famous American physiologist Loeb states that\r\nwe do not meet with algæ in hot springs at temperatures above 55°.\r\n\r\nSince, now, the temperature of the earth-crust would much more quickly\r\nsink from 100° to 55° than it had fallen from 1000° to 100°, we may\r\nimagine that only a few thousands of years may have intervened between\r\nthe formation of the first crust of the earth and the cooling down\r\nto a temperature such as would sustain life. Since that time the\r\ntemperature has probably never been so low that the larger portion\r\nof the earth’s surface would not have been able to support organisms,\r\nalthough there have been several glacial ages in which the arctic\r\ndistricts inaccessible to life must have extended much farther than\r\nat present. The ocean will also have been free of ice over much the\r\ngreatest portion of its surface at all times, and may therefore have\r\nbeen inhabited by organisms in all ages. The interior of the earth\r\ncools continually, though slowly, because heat passes from the inner,\r\nwarmer portions to the other, cooler portions through the crust of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe earth is able to serve as the abode of living beings because its\r\nouter portions are cooled to a suitable temperature (below 55°) by\r\nradiation, and because the cooling does not proceed so far that the\r\nopen sea would continually be frozen over, and that the temperature on\r\nthe Continent would always remain below freezing-point. We owe this\r\nfavorable intermediate stage to the fact that the radiation from the\r\nsun balances the loss of heat by radiation into space, and that it is\r\ncapable of maintaining the greater portion of the surface of the earth\r\nat a temperature above the freezing-point of water. The temperature\r\nconditioning life on a planet is therefore maintained only because,\r\non the one side, light and heat are received by radiation from the\r\nsun in sufficient quantities, while on the other side an equivalent\r\nradiation of heat takes place into space. If the heat gain and the heat\r\nloss were not to balance each other, the term of suitable conditions\r\nwould not last long. The temperature of the earth-crust could sink\r\nin a few hundreds or thousands of years from 1000° to 100°, because\r\nwhen the earth was at this high temperature its radiation into space\r\npredominated over the radiation received from the sun. On the other\r\nhand, about a hundred million years have passed, according to Joly,\r\nsince the age when the ocean originated. The temperature of the earth,\r\ntherefore, required this long space of time in order to cool down from\r\n365° (at which temperature water vapor can first be condensed to liquid\r\nwater) to its present temperature. The cooling afterwards proceeded at\r\na slower rate, because the difference between the radiations inward and\r\noutward was lessened with the diminishing temperature of the earth.\r\nVarious methods have been applied in estimating these periods. Joly\r\nbased his estimate on the percentage of salt in the sea and in the\r\nrivers. If we calculate how much salt there is in the sea, and how much\r\nsalt the rivers can supply to it in the course of a year, we arrive at\r\nthe result that the quantity of salt now stored in the ocean might have\r\nbeen supplied in about a hundred million years.\r\n\r\nWe arrive at still higher numbers when we calculate the time which\r\nmust have elapsed during the deposition of all the stratified and\r\nsedimentary layers. Sir Archibald Geikie estimates the total thickness\r\nof those strata, supposing them to have been undisturbed, at 30,000\r\nm. (nearly 20 miles). He concludes, further, from the examination of\r\nmore recent strata, that every stratum one metre in thickness must\r\nhave required from 3000 to 20,000 years for its formation. We should,\r\ntherefore, have to allow a space of from ninety to six hundred million\r\nyears for the deposition of all the sedimentary strata. The Finnish\r\ngeologist Sederholm even fixes the time at a thousand million years.\r\n\r\nAnother method again starts from the consideration that, while the\r\ntemperature of the surface of the earth remains fairly steady owing to\r\nthe heat exchange between solar radiation and terrestrial radiation\r\ninto space, the interior of the earth must have shrunk with the\r\ncooling. How far this shrinkage extends we may estimate from the\r\nformation of the mountain chains which, according to Rudzki, cover\r\n1.6 per cent. of the earth’s surface. The earth’s radius should\r\nconsequently have contracted by about 0.8 per cent., corresponding to\r\na cooling through about 300°, which would require two thousand million\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nQuite recently the renowned physical chemist Rutherford has expounded\r\na most original method of estimating the age of minerals. Uranium and\r\nthorium are supposed to produce helium by their slow dissociation, and\r\nwe know how much helium is produced from a certain quantity of uranium\r\nor thorium in a year. Now Ramsay has determined the percentage of\r\nhelium in the uranium mineral fergusonite and in thorianite. Rutherford\r\nthen calculates the time which would have passed since the formation of\r\nthese minerals. He demands at least four hundred million years, “for\r\nvery probably some helium has escaped from the minerals during that\r\ntime.” Although this estimate is very uncertain, it is interesting to\r\nfind that it leads to an age for the solid earth-crust of the same\r\norder of magnitude as the other methods.\r\n\r\nDuring this whole epoch of almost inconceivable length of between one\r\nhundred million and two thousand million years, organisms have existed\r\non the surface of the earth and in the sea which do not differ so very\r\nmuch from those now alive. The temperature of the surface may have\r\nbeen higher than it is at present; but the difference cannot be very\r\ngreat, and will amount to 20° Cent. (36° F.) at the highest. The actual\r\nmean temperature of the surface of the earth is 16° Cent. (61° F.). It\r\nvaries from about -20° Cent. (-4° F.) at the North Pole, and -10° Cent.\r\n(+14° F.) at the South Pole to 26° Cent. (79° F.) in the tropical zone.\r\nThe main difference between the temperatures of the earth’s surface in\r\nthe most remote period from which fossils are extant and the actual\r\nstate rather seems to be that the different zones of the earth are now\r\ncharacterized by unequal temperatures, while in the remote epochs the\r\nheat was almost uniformly distributed over the whole earth.\r\n\r\nThe condition for this prolonged, almost stationary state was that the\r\ngain of heat of the earth’s surface by radiation from the sun and the\r\nloss of heat by radiation into space nearly balanced each other. That\r\nthe replenishing supply by radiation from an intensely hot body—in\r\nour case the sun—is indispensable for the existence of life will be\r\nevident to everybody. Not everybody may, however, have considered that\r\nthe loss of heat into cold space or into colder surroundings is just as\r\nindispensable. To some people, indeed, the assumption that the earth as\r\nwell as the sun should waste the largest portions of their vital heat\r\nas radiation into cold space appears so unsatisfactory that they prefer\r\nto believe radiation to be confined to radiation between celestial\r\nbodies; there is no radiation into space, in their opinion. All the\r\nsolar heat would thus benefit the planets and the moons in the solar\r\nsystem, and only a vanishing portion of it would fall upon the fixed\r\nstars, because their visual angles are so small. If that were really\r\ncorrect, the temperature of the planets would rise at a rapid rate\r\nuntil it became almost equal to that of the sun, and all life would\r\nbecome impossible. We are therefore constrained to admit that “things\r\nare best as they are,” although the great waste of solar heat certainly\r\nweakens the solar energy.\r\n\r\nThe opinion that all the solar heat radiated into infinite space is\r\nwasted, starts moreover from a hypothesis which is not proved, and\r\nwhich is highly improbable—namely, that only an extremely small\r\nportion of the sky is covered with celestial bodies. That might\r\ncertainly be correct if we assumed, as has formerly been done, that\r\nthe majority of the celestial bodies must be luminous. We do not\r\npossess, however, any reliable knowledge of the number and size of the\r\ndark celestial bodies. In order to account for the observed movements\r\nof different stars, it has been thought that there must be in the\r\nneighborhood of some of them dark stars of enormous size whose masses\r\nwould surpass the mass of our sun, or, at least, be equal to it. But\r\nthe largest number of the dark celestial bodies which hide the rays\r\nfrom the stars behind them probably consist of smaller particles,\r\nsuch as we observe in meteors and in comets, and to a large extent of\r\nso-called cosmical dust. The observations of later years, by the aid\r\nof most powerful instruments, have shown that so-called nebulæ and\r\nnebulous stars abound throughout the heavens. In their interior we\r\nshould probably find accumulations of dark masses.\r\n\r\nThe light intensity of most of the nebulæ is, moreover, far too weak to\r\npermit of their being perceived. We have, therefore, to imagine that\r\nthere are bodies all through infinite space, and about as numerous as\r\nthey are in the immediate neighborhood of our solar system. Thus every\r\nray from the sun, of whatever direction, would finally hit upon some\r\ncelestial body, and nothing would be lost of the solar radiation, nor\r\nof the stellar radiation.\r\n\r\nAs regards the radiation-heat exchange, the earth might be likened to\r\na steam-engine. In order that the steam-engine shall perform useful\r\nwork, it is necessary not only that the engine be supplied with heat\r\nof high temperature from a furnace and a boiler, but also that the\r\nengine be able to give its heat up again to a heat reservoir of lower\r\ntemperature—a condenser or cooler. It is only by transferring heat\r\nfrom a body of higher temperature to another body of lower temperature\r\nthat the engine can do work. In a similar way no work can be done on\r\nthe earth, and no life can exist, unless heat be conferred by the\r\nintermediation of the earth from a hot body, the sun, to the colder\r\nsurroundings of universal space—_i.e._, to the cold celestial bodies\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nTo a certain extent the temperature of the earth’s surface, as we shall\r\npresently see, is conditional by the properties of the atmosphere\r\nsurrounding it, and particularly by the permeability of the latter for\r\nthe rays of heat.\r\n\r\nIf the earth did not possess an atmosphere, or if this atmosphere were\r\nperfectly diathermal—_i.e._, pervious to heat radiations—we should\r\nbe able to calculate the mean temperature of the earth’s surface,\r\ngiven the intensity of the solar radiation, from Stefan’s law of the\r\ndependence of heat radiation on its temperature. Starting from the not\r\nimprobable assumption that, at a mean distance of the earth from the\r\nsun, the solar rays would send 2.5 gramme-calories per minute to a body\r\nof cross section of 1 sq. centimetre at right angles to the rays of the\r\nsun, Christiansen has calculated the mean temperatures of the surfaces\r\nof the various planets. The following table gives his figures, and\r\nalso the mean distances of the planets from the sun, in units of the\r\nmean distance of the earth from the sun, 149.5 million km. (nearly 93\r\nmillion miles):\r\n\r\n   ─────────┬─────────┬───────────┬──────────┬───────────────┬──────────\r\n            │ Radius  │    Mass   │  Mean    │      Mean     │  Density\r\n    Planet  ├─────────┴───────────┤ distance │   temperature │ according\r\n            │ According to See    │          │               │  to See\r\n   ─────────┼─────────┬───────────┼──────────┼───────────────┼──────────\r\n   Mercury  │   0.341 │    0.0224 │   0.39   │ + 178°(332°)  │   0.564\r\n   Venus    │   0.955 │    0.815  │   0.72   │ +  65°        │   0.936\r\n   Earth    │   1     │    1      │   1      │ +   6.5°      │   1\r\n   Moon     │   0.273 │    0.01228│   1      │ +   6.5°(105°)│   0.604\r\n   Mars     │   0.53  │    0.1077 │   1.52   │ -  37°        │   0.729\r\n   Jupiter  │  11.13  │  317.7    │   5.2    │ - 147°        │   0.230\r\n   Saturn   │   9.35  │   95.1    │   9.55   │ - 180°        │   0.116\r\n   Uranus   │   3.35  │   14.6    │  19.22   │ - 207°        │   0.388\r\n   Neptune  │   3.43  │   17.2    │  30.12   │ - 221°        │   0.429\r\n   Sun      │ 109.1   │ 332,750   │     0    │ +6200°        │   0.256\r\n   ─────────┴─────────┴───────────┴──────────┴───────────────┴──────────\r\n\r\nIn the case of Mercury, I have added another figure, 332°. Mercury\r\nalways turns the same side to the sun, and the hottest point of this\r\nside would reach a temperature of 397°; its mean temperature, according\r\nto my calculation, is 332°, while the other side, turned away from the\r\nsun, cannot be at a temperature much above absolute zero, -273°. I have\r\nmade a similar calculation for the moon, which turns so slowly about\r\nits axis (once in twenty-seven days) that the temperature on the side\r\nilluminated by the sun remains almost as high (106°) as if the moon\r\nwere always turning the same face to the sun. The hottest point of\r\nthis surface would attain a temperature of 150°, while the poles of\r\nthe moon and that part of the other side which remains longest without\r\nillumination can, again, not be much above absolute zero temperature.\r\nThis estimate is in fair agreement with the measurements made of the\r\nlunar radiation and the temperature estimate based upon it. The first\r\nmeasurement of this kind was made by the Earl of Rosse. He ascertained\r\nthat the moon disk as illuminated by the sun—that is to say, the full\r\nmoon—would radiate as much heat as a black body of the temperature\r\n110° Cent. (230° F.). A later measurement by the American Very seems\r\nto indicate that the hottest point of the moon is at about 180°, which\r\nwould be 30° higher than my estimate. In the cases of the moon and\r\nof Mercury, which do not possess any atmosphere to speak of, this\r\ncalculation may very fairly agree with the actual state of affairs.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the planet Venus would be about 65° Cent. (149° F.)\r\nif its atmosphere were perfectly transparent. We know, however, that\r\ndense clouds, probably of water drops, are floating in the atmosphere\r\nof this planet, preventing us from seeing its land and water surfaces.\r\nAccording to the determinations made by Zöllner and others, Venus\r\nwould reflect not less than 76 per cent. of the incident light of the\r\nsun, and the planet would thus be as white as a snow-ball. The rays of\r\nheat are not reflected to the same extent. We may estimate that the\r\nportion of heat absorbed by the planet is about half the incident heat.\r\nThe temperature of Venus will therefore be reduced considerably, but it\r\nis partly augmented again by the protective action of this atmosphere.\r\nThe mean temperature of Venus may, hence, not differ much from the\r\ncalculated temperature, and may amount to about 40° (104° F.). Under\r\nthese circumstances the assumption would appear plausible that a very\r\nconsiderable portion of the surface of Venus, and particularly the\r\ndistricts about the poles, would be favorable to organic life.\r\n\r\nPassing to the earth, we find that the temperature-reducing influence\r\nof the clouds must be strong. They protect about half of the earth’s\r\nsurface (52 per cent.) from solar radiation. But even with a perfectly\r\nclear sky, not all the light from the sun really reaches the earth’s\r\nsurface; for finely distributed dust is floating even in the purest\r\nair. I have estimated that this dust would probably absorb 17 per cent.\r\nof the solar heat. Clouds and dust would therefore together deprive the\r\nearth of 34 per cent. of the heat sent to it, which would lead to a\r\nreduction of the temperature by about 28°. Dust and the water-bubbles\r\nin the clouds also prevent the radiation of heat from the earth, so\r\nthat the total loss of heat to be charged to clouds and dust will\r\namount to about 20° (36° F.).\r\n\r\nIt has now been ascertained that the mean temperature of the earth is\r\n16° (61° F.), instead of the calculated 6.5° (43.7° F.). Deducting the\r\n20° due to the influence of dust and clouds, we obtain -14° (7° F.), and\r\nthe observed temperature would therefore be higher than the calculated\r\nby no less than 30° (54° F.). The discrepancy is explained by the\r\nheat-protecting action of the gases contained in the atmosphere, to\r\nwhich we shall presently refer (page 51).\r\n\r\nThere are but few clouds on Mars. This planet is endowed with an\r\natmosphere of extreme transparency, and should therefore have a high\r\ntemperature. Instead of the temperature of -37° (35° F.), calculated,\r\nthe mean temperature seems to be +10° (+50° F.). During the winter\r\nlarge white masses, evidently snow, collect on the poles of Mars, which\r\nrapidly melt away in spring and change into water that appears dark to\r\nus. Sometimes the snow-caps on the poles of Mars disappear entirely\r\nduring the Mars summer; this never happens on our terrestrial poles.\r\nThe mean temperature of Mars must therefore be above zero, probably\r\nabout +10°. Organic life may very probably thrive, therefore, on Mars.\r\nIt is, however, rather sanguine to jump at the conclusion that the\r\nso-called canals of Mars prove its being inhabited by intelligent\r\nbeings. Many people regard the “canals” as optical illusions; Lowell’s\r\nphotographs, however, do not justify this opinion.\r\n\r\nAs regards the other large planets, the temperatures which we have\r\ncalculated for them are very low. This calculation is, however, rather\r\nillusory, because these planets probably do not possess any solid or\r\nliquid surface, but consist altogether of gases. Their densities, at\r\nleast, point in this direction. In the case of the inner planets,\r\nMars and our moon included, the density is rather less than that of\r\nthe earth. Mercury stands last among them, with its specific gravity\r\nof 0.564. There follows a great drop in the specific gravities of\r\nthe outer large planets. Saturn, with a density of 0.116, is last in\r\nthis order; the densities of the two outermost planets lie somewhat\r\nhigher—by 0.3 or 0.4 about—but these last data are very uncertain.\r\nYet these figures are of the same order of magnitude as that assumed\r\nfor the sun—0.25—and we believe that the sun, apart from the small\r\nclouds, is wholly a gaseous body. It is therefore probable that\r\nthe outer planets, including Jupiter, will also be gaseous and be\r\nsurrounded by dense veils of clouds which prevent our looking down\r\ninto their interior. That view would contend against the idea that\r\nthese planets can harbor any living beings. We could rather imagine\r\ntheir moons to be inhabited. If these moons received no heat from their\r\nplanets, they would assume the above-stated temperatures of their\r\ncentral bodies. Looked at from our moon, the earth appears under a\r\nvisual angle, 3.7 times as large as that of the sun. As the temperature\r\nof the sun has, from its radiation, been estimated at 6200° Cent., or\r\n6500° absolute, the moon would receive as much heat from the earth as\r\nfrom the sun, if the earth had a temperature of about 3100° Cent., or\r\n3380° absolute. When the first clouds of water vapor were being formed\r\nin the terrestrial atmosphere, the earth’s temperature was about 360°,\r\nand the radiation from the earth to the moon only about 1.25-thousandth\r\nof that of the sun. The present radiation from the earth does not\r\neven attain one-twentieth of this value. It is thus manifest that\r\nthe radiation from the earth does not play any part in the thermal\r\nhousehold of the moon.\r\n\r\nThe relations would be quite different if the earth had the 11.6 times\r\ngreater diameter of Jupiter, or the diameter of Saturn, which is\r\n9.3 times greater than its own. The radiation from the earth to the\r\nmoon would then make up about a sixth or a ninth of the actual solar\r\nradiation, taking the temperature of the earth’s surface at 360°. We\r\ncan easily calculate, further, that Jupiter and Saturn would radiate\r\nas much heat against a moon at a distance of 240,000 or 191,000 km.\r\nrespectively (since the distance of the moon from the earth amounts\r\nto 384,000 km.) as the sun sends to Mars—taking the temperature of\r\nthose planets at 360° Cent. Now we find, near Jupiter as well as near\r\nSaturn, moons at the distances of 126,000 and 186,000 km. respectively,\r\nwhich are smaller than those mentioned, and it is not inconceivable\r\nthat these moons receive from their central bodies sufficient heat\r\nto render life possible, provided that they be enveloped by a\r\nheat-absorbing atmosphere. The conditions appear to be less favorable\r\nfor the innermost satellites of Jupiter and Saturn. When their planets\r\nare shining at the maximum brilliancy, their light intensity is only\r\na sixth or a ninth of the solar light intensity, which upon these\r\nsatellites is itself only one-twenty-seventh or one-ninetieth of the\r\nintensity on the earth. During the incandescence epoch of these planets\r\ntheir moons will certainly for some time have been suitable for the\r\ndevelopment of life.\r\n\r\nThat the atmospheric envelopes limit the heat losses from the planets\r\nhad been suggested about 1800 by the great French physicist Fourier.\r\nHis ideas were further developed afterwards by Pouillet and Tyndall.\r\nTheir theory has been styled the hot-house theory, because they thought\r\nthat the atmosphere acted after the manner of the glass panes of\r\nhot-houses. Glass possesses the property of being transparent to heat\r\nrays of small wave lengths belonging to the visible spectrum; but it is\r\nnot transparent to dark heat rays, such, for instance, as are sent out\r\nby a heated furnace or by a hot lump of earth. The heat rays of the sun\r\nnow are to a large extent of the visible, bright kind. They penetrate\r\nthrough the glass of the hot-house and heat the earth under the glass.\r\nThe radiation from the earth, on the other hand, is dark and cannot\r\npass back through the glass, which thus stops any losses of heat, just\r\nas an overcoat protects the body against too strong a loss of heat by\r\nradiation. Langley made an experiment with a box, which he packed with\r\ncotton-wool to reduce loss by radiation, and which he provided, on the\r\nside turned towards the sun, with a double glass pane. He observed\r\nthat the temperature rose to 113° (235° F.), while the thermometer\r\nonly marked 14° or 15° (57° or 59° F.) in the shade. This experiment\r\nwas conducted on Pike’s Peak, in Colorado, at an altitude of 4200 m.\r\n(13,800 ft.), on September 9, 1881, at 1 hr. 4 min. P.M., and therefore\r\nat a particularly intense solar radiation.\r\n\r\nFourier and Pouillet now thought that the atmosphere of our earth\r\nshould be endowed with properties resembling those of glass, as regards\r\npermeability of heat. Tyndall later proved this assumption to be\r\ncorrect. The chief invisible constituents of the air which participate\r\nin this effect are water vapor, which is always found in a certain\r\nquantity in the air, and carbonic acid, also ozone and hydrocarbons.\r\nThese latter occur in such small quantities that no allowance has been\r\nmade for them so far in the calculations. Of late, however, we have\r\nbeen supplied with very careful observations on the permeability to\r\nheat of carbonic acid and of water vapor. With the help of these data\r\nI have calculated that if the atmosphere were deprived of all its\r\ncarbonic acid—of which it contains only 0.03 per cent. by volume—the\r\ntemperature of the earth’s surface would fall by about 21°. This\r\nlowering of the temperature would diminish the amount of water vapor\r\nin the atmosphere, and would cause a further almost equally strong\r\nfall of temperature. The examples, so far as they go, demonstrate that\r\ncomparatively unimportant variations in the composition of the air\r\nhave a very great influence. If the quantity of carbonic acid in the\r\nair should sink to one-half its present percentage, the temperature\r\nwould fall by about 4°; a diminution to one-quarter would reduce the\r\ntemperature by 8°. On the other hand, any doubling of the percentage of\r\ncarbon dioxide in the air would raise the temperature of the earth’s\r\nsurface by 4°; and if the carbon dioxide were increased fourfold, the\r\ntemperature would rise by 8°. Further, a diminution of the carbonic\r\nacid percentage would accentuate the temperature differences between\r\nthe different portions of the earth, while an increase in this\r\npercentage would tend to equalize the temperature.\r\n\r\nThe question, however, is whether any such temperature fluctuations\r\nhave really been observed on the surface of the earth. The geologists\r\nwould answer: yes. Our historical era was preceded by a period in which\r\nthe mean temperature was by 2° (3.6 F.) higher than at present. We\r\nrecognize this from the former distribution of the ordinary hazel-nut\r\nand of the water-nut (_Trapa natans_). Fossil nuts of these two species\r\nhave been found in localities where the plants could not thrive in\r\nthe present climate. This age, again, was preceded by an age which,\r\nwe are pretty certain, drove the inhabitants of northern Europe from\r\ntheir old abodes. The glacial age must have been divided into several\r\nperiods, alternating with intervals of milder climates, the so-called\r\ninter-glacial periods. The space of time which is characterized by\r\nthese glacial periods, when the temperature—according to measurements\r\nbased upon the study of the spreading of glaciers in the Alps—must\r\nhave been about 5° (8° F.) lower than now, has been estimated by\r\ngeologists at not less than 100,000 years. This epoch was preceded by\r\na warmer age, in which the temperature, to judge from fossilized plants\r\nof those days, must at times have been by 8° or 9° (14° or 16° F.)\r\nhigher than at present, and, moreover, much more uniformly distributed\r\nover the whole earth (Eocene). Pronounced fluctuations of this kind in\r\nthe climate have also occurred in former geological periods.\r\n\r\nAre we now justified in supposing that the percentage of carbon dioxide\r\nin the air has varied to an extent sufficient to account for the\r\ntemperature changes? This question has been answered in the affirmative\r\nby Högbom, and, in later times, by Stevenson. The actual percentage of\r\ncarbonic acid in the air is so insignificant that the annual combustion\r\nof coal, which has now (1904) risen to about 900 million tons and is\r\nrapidly increasing,[3] carries about one-seven-hundredth part of its\r\npercentage of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Although the sea, by\r\nabsorbing carbonic acid, acts as a regulator of huge capacity, which\r\ntakes up about five-sixths of the produced carbonic acid, we yet\r\nrecognize that the slight percentage of carbonic acid in the atmosphere\r\nmay by the advances of industry be changed to a noticeable degree in\r\nthe course of a few centuries. That would imply that there is no real\r\nstability in the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air, which is\r\nprobably subject to considerable fluctuations in the course of time.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: It amounted in 1890 to 510 million tons; in 1894,\r\n    to 550; in 1899, to 690; and in 1904, to 890 million tons.]\r\n\r\nVolcanism is the natural process by which the greatest amount of\r\ncarbonic acid is supplied to the air. Large quantities of gases\r\noriginating in the interior of the earth are ejected through the\r\ncraters of the volcanoes. These gases consist mostly of steam and of\r\ncarbon dioxide, which have been liberated during the slow cooling of\r\nthe silicates in the interior of the earth. The volcanic phenomena\r\nhave been of very unequal intensity in the different phases of the\r\nhistory of the earth, and we have reason to surmise that the percentage\r\nof carbon dioxide in the air was considerably greater during periods\r\nof strong volcanic activity than it is now, and smaller in quieter\r\nperiods. Professor Frech, of Breslau, has attempted to demonstrate\r\nthat this would be in accordance with geological experience, because\r\nstrongly volcanic periods are distinguished by warm climates, and\r\nperiods of feeble volcanic intensity by cold climates. The ice age\r\nin particular was characterized by a nearly complete cessation of\r\nvolcanism, and the two periods at the commencement and at the middle of\r\nthe Tertiary age (Eocene and Miocene) which showed high temperatures\r\nwere also marked by an extraordinarily developed volcanic activity.\r\nThis parallelism can be traced back into more remote epochs.\r\n\r\nIt may possibly be a matter of surprise that the percentage of\r\ncarbon dioxide in the atmosphere should not constantly be increased,\r\nsince volcanism is always pouring out more carbon dioxide into our\r\natmosphere. There is, however, one factor which always tends to reduce\r\nthe carbon dioxide of the air, and that is the weathering of minerals.\r\nThe rocks which were first formed by the congelation of the volcanic\r\nmasses (the so-called magma) consist of compounds of silicic acid\r\nwith alumina, lime, magnesia, some iron and sodium. These rocks were\r\ngradually decomposed by the carbonic acid contained in the air and\r\nin the water, and it was especially the lime, the magnesia, and the\r\nalkalies, and, in some measure also the iron, which formed soluble\r\ncarbonates. These carbonates were carried by the rivers down into the\r\nseas. There lime and magnesia were secreted by the animals and by the\r\nalgæ, and their carbonic acid became stored up in the sedimentary\r\nstrata. Högbom estimates that the limestones and dolomites contain at\r\nleast 25,000 times more carbonic acid than our atmosphere. Chamberlin\r\nhas arrived at nearly the same figure—from 20,000 to 30,000; he\r\ndoes not allow for the precambrian limestones. These estimates are\r\nmost likely far too low. All the carbonic acid that is stored up in\r\nsedimentary strata must have passed through the atmosphere. Another\r\nprocess which withdraws carbonic acid from the air is the assimilation\r\nof plants. Plants absorb carbonic acid under secretion of carbon\r\ncompounds and under exhalation of oxygen. Like the weathering, the\r\nassimilation increases with the percentage of carbonic acid. The\r\nPolish botanist E. Godlewski showed as early as 1872 that various\r\nplants (he studied _Typha latifolia_ and _Glyceria spectabilus_ with\r\nparticular care) absorb from the air an amount of carbonic acid which\r\nincreases proportionally with the percentage of carbonic acid in the\r\natmosphere up to 1 per cent., and that the assimilation then attains,\r\nin the former plant, a maximum at 6 per cent., and in the latter\r\nplant at 9 per cent. The assimilation afterwards diminishes if the\r\ncarbonic acid percentage is further augmented. If, therefore, the\r\npercentage of carbon dioxide be doubled, the absorption by the plants\r\nwould also be doubled. If, at the same time, the temperature rises by\r\n4°, the vitality will increase in the ratio of 1: 1.5, so that the\r\ndoubling of the carbon dioxide percentage will lead to an increase\r\nin the absorption of carbonic acid by the plant approximately in the\r\nratio of 1: 3. The same may be assumed to hold for the dependence\r\nof the weathering upon the atmospheric percentage of carbonic acid.\r\nAn increase of the carbon dioxide percentage to double its amount\r\nmay hence be able to raise the intensity of vegetable life and the\r\nintensity of the inorganic chemical reactions threefold.\r\n\r\nAccording to the estimate of the famous chemist Liebig, the quantity of\r\norganic matter (freed of water) which is produced by one hectare (2.5\r\nacres) of soil, meadowland, or forest is nearly the same, approximately\r\n2.5 tons per year in central Europe. In many parts of the tropics the\r\ngrowth is much more rapid; in other places, in the deserts and arctic\r\nregions, much more feeble. We may be justified in accepting Liebig’s\r\nfigure as an average for the firm land on our earth. Of the organic\r\nsubstances to which we have referred, and which mainly consist of\r\ncellulose, carbon makes up 40 per cent. Thus the actual annual carbon\r\nproduction by plants would amount to 13,000 million tons—_i.e._,\r\nnot quite fifteen times more than the consumption of coal, and about\r\none-fiftieth of the quantity of the carbon dioxide in the air. If,\r\ntherefore, all plants were to deposit their carbon in peat-bogs, the\r\nair would soon be depleted of its carbon dioxide. But it is only a\r\nfraction of one per cent. of the coal which is produced by plants that\r\nis stored up for the future in this way. The rest is sent back into the\r\natmosphere by combustion or by decay.\r\n\r\nChamberlin relates that, together with five other American geologists,\r\nhe attempted to estimate how long a time would be required before\r\nthe carbon dioxide of the air would be consumed by the weathering of\r\nrocks. Their various estimates yielded figures ranging from 5000 to\r\n18,000 years, with a probable average of 10,000 years. The loss of\r\ncarbonic acid by the formation of peat may be estimated at the same\r\nfigure. The production of carbonic acid by the combustion of coal would\r\ntherefore suffice to cover the loss of carbonic acid by weathering and\r\nby peat formation seven times over. Those are the two chief factors\r\ndeciding the consumption of carbonic acid, and we thus recognize that\r\nthe percentage of carbonic acid in the air must be increasing at a\r\nconstant rate as long as the consumption of coal, petroleum, etc., is\r\nmaintained at its present figure, and at a still more rapid rate if\r\nthis consumption should continue to increase as it does now.\r\n\r\nThis consideration enables us to picture to ourselves the possibility\r\nof the enormous plant-growth which must have characterized certain\r\ngeological periods of our earth—for instance, the carboniferous period.\r\n\r\nThis period is known to us from the extraordinarily large number of\r\nplants which we find embedded in the clay of the swamps of those days.\r\nThose plants were slowly carbonized afterwards, and their carbon is in\r\nour age returned to its original place in the household of nature in\r\nthe shape of carbonic acid. A great portion of the carbonic acid has\r\ndisappeared from the atmosphere of the earth, and has been stored up as\r\ncoal, lignite, peat, petroleum, or asphalt in the sedimentary strata.\r\nOxygen was liberated at the same time, and passed into our atmospheric\r\nsea. It has been calculated that the amount of oxygen in the air—1216\r\nbillion tons—approximately corresponds to the mass of fossil coal\r\nwhich is stored up in the sedimentary strata. The supposition appears\r\nnatural, therefore, that all the oxygen of the air may have been\r\nformed at the expense of the carbonic acid in the air. This view was\r\nfirst advanced by Kœhne, of Brussels, in 1856, and later discussions\r\nhave strengthened its probability. Part of the oxygen is certainly\r\nconsumed by weathering processes, and absorbed—_e.g._, by sulphides\r\nand by ferro-salts; without this oxidation the actual quantity of\r\noxygen in the air would be greater. On the other hand, there are in\r\nthe sedimentary strata many oxidizable compounds—_e. g._, especially\r\niron sulphides—which have probably been reduced by the interaction\r\nof carbon (by organic compounds). A large number of the substances\r\nwhich consume oxygen during their decomposition and decay have also\r\nbeen produced by the intermediation of the coal which had previously\r\nbeen deposited under liberation of oxygen, so that these substances\r\nare, by their oxidation, restored to their original state. We may\r\nhence take it as established that the masses of free oxygen in the air\r\nand of free carbon in the sedimentary strata approximately correspond\r\nto each other, and that probably all the oxygen of the atmosphere\r\nowes its existence to plant life. This appears plausible also for\r\nanother reason. We know for certain that there is some free oxygen in\r\nthe atmosphere of the sun, and that hydrogen abounds in the sun. The\r\nearth’s atmosphere may originally have been in the same condition.\r\nWhen the earth cooled gradually, hydrogen and oxygen combined to\r\nwater, but an excess of hydrogen must have remained. The primeval\r\natmosphere of the earth may also have contained hydrocarbons, as they\r\nplay an important part in the gases of comets. To these gases there\r\nwere added carbonic acid and water vapor, coming from the interior of\r\nthe earth. Thanks to its chemical inertia, the nitrogen of the air may\r\nnot have undergone much change in the course of the ages. An English\r\nchemist, Phipson, claims to have shown that both higher plants (the\r\ncorn-bind) and lower organisms (various bacteria) can live and develop\r\nin an atmosphere devoid of oxygen when it contains carbonic acid and\r\nhydrogen. It is also possible that simple forms of vegetable life\r\nexisted before the air contained any oxygen, and that these plants\r\nliberated the oxygen from the carbonic acid exhaled by the craters.\r\nThis oxygen gradually (possibly under the influence of electric\r\ndischarges) converted the hydrogen and the hydrocarbons of the air into\r\nwater and carbonic acid until those elements were consumed. The oxygen\r\nremained in the air, whose composition gradually approached more the\r\nactual state.[4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: According to the opinion of a colleague of mine,\r\n    a botanist, the results of the experiments of Phipson must be\r\n    regarded as very doubtful, and some oxygen would appear to be\r\n    indispensable for the growth of plants. We have to imagine the\r\n    development somewhat as follows: As the earth separated from\r\n    the solar nebula, its temperature was very high at first in its\r\n    outer portions. At this temperature it was not able to retain\r\n    the lighter gases, like hydrogen and helium, for a long period;\r\n    the heavy gases, like nitrogen and oxygen, remained. The\r\n    original excess of hydrogen and helium disappeared, therefore,\r\n    before the crust of the earth had been formed, and the\r\n    atmosphere of the earth immediately after the formation of the\r\n    crust contained some oxygen, besides much nitrogen, carbonic\r\n    acid, and water vapor. The main bulk of the actual atmospheric\r\n    oxygen would therefore have been reduced from carbon dioxide by\r\n    the intermediation of plants. The view that celestial bodies\r\n    may lose part of their atmosphere is due to Johnstone Stoney.\r\n    The atmospheric gases escape the more rapidly the lighter their\r\n    molecules and the smaller the mass of the celestial bodies. On\r\n    these lines we explain that the smaller celestial bodies like\r\n    the moon and Mercury, have lost almost all their atmosphere,\r\n    while the earth has only lost hydrogen and helium, which again\r\n    have been retained by the sun.]\r\n\r\nThis oxygen is an essential element for the production of animal life.\r\nAs animal life stands above vegetable life, so animal life could only\r\noriginate at a later stage than plant life. Plants require, in addition\r\nto suitable temperature, only carbonic acid and water, and these\r\ngases will probably be found in the atmospheres of all the planets\r\nas exhalations of their inner incandescent masses which are slowly\r\ncooling. The presence of water vapor has directly been established, by\r\nmeans of the spectroscope, in the atmospheres of other planets—Venus,\r\nJupiter, and Saturn—and indirectly by the observation of a snow-cap on\r\nMars. The spectroscope further gives us indication of the presence of\r\nother gases. There is an intense band in the red part of the spectra of\r\nJupiter and Saturn, of wave-length 0.000618 mm. Other new constituents\r\nof unknown nature have been discerned in the spectra of Uranus and\r\nNeptune. On the other hand, there is hardly any, or at any rate only\r\na quite insignificant, atmosphere on the moon and on Mercury. This\r\nis easily understood. The temperature on that side of Mercury which\r\nis turned away from the sun is near absolute zero. All the gases of\r\nthe planetary atmosphere would collect and condense there. If, then,\r\nMercury had originally an atmosphere, it must have lost it as it lost\r\nits own rotation, compelling it to turn always the same face towards\r\nthe sun. Similar reasons may account for the absence of a lunar\r\natmosphere. If Venus should likewise always turn the same side towards\r\nthe sun, as many astronomers assert, Venus should not have any notable\r\natmosphere, nor clouds either. We know, however, that this planet is\r\nsurrounded by a very marked developed atmosphere.[5]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: That results from the very strong refraction which\r\n    light undergoes in the atmosphere of Venus when this planet\r\n    is seen in front of the sun’s edge during the so-called Venus\r\n    transits.]\r\n\r\nAnd that is the strongest objection to the assumption that Venus\r\nfollows the example of Mercury as regards the rotation about its own\r\naxis.\r\n\r\nSince, now, warm ages have alternated with glacial periods, even after\r\nman appeared on the earth, we have to ask ourselves: Is it probable\r\nthat we shall in the coming geological ages be visited by a new ice\r\nperiod that will drive us from our temperate countries into the hotter\r\nclimates of Africa? There does not appear to be much ground for such\r\nan apprehension. The enormous combustion of coal by our industrial\r\nestablishments suffices to increase the percentage of carbon dioxide\r\nin the air to a perceptible degree. Volcanism, whose devastations—\r\non Krakatoa (1883) and Martinique (1902)—have been terrible in late\r\nyears, appears to be growing more intense. It is probable, therefore,\r\nthat the percentage of carbonic acid increases at a rapid rate. Another\r\ncircumstance points in the same direction; that is, that the sea\r\nseems to withdraw carbonic acid from the air. For the carbonic acid\r\npercentage above the sea and on islands is on an average 10 per cent.\r\nless than the above continents.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 17.—Photograph of the surface of the moon,\r\n    in the vicinity of the crater of Copernicus. Taken at the\r\n    Yerkes Observatory, Chicago, U. S. A. Scale: Diameter of moon,\r\n    0.55 m. = 21.7 in. Owing to the absence of an atmosphere and of\r\n    atmospheric precipitations, the precipitous walls of the crater\r\n    and other elevations do not indicate any signs of decay.]\r\n\r\nIf the carbonic acid percentage of the air had kept constant for\r\nages, the percentage of the water would have found time to get into\r\nequilibrium with it; but the sea actually absorbs carbonic acid\r\nfrom the air. Thus the sea-water must have been in equilibrium with\r\nan atmosphere which contained less carbonic acid than the present\r\natmosphere. Hence the carbonic acid percentage has been increasing of\r\nlate.\r\n\r\nWe often hear lamentations that the coal stored up in the earth is\r\nwasted by the present generation without any thought of the future, and\r\nwe are terrified by the awful destruction of life and property which\r\nhas followed the volcanic eruptions of our days. We may find a kind of\r\nconsolation in the consideration that here, as in every other case,\r\nthere is good mixed with the evil. By the influence of the increasing\r\npercentage of carbonic acid in the atmosphere, we may hope to enjoy\r\nages with more equable and better climates, especially as regards the\r\ncolder regions of the earth, ages when the earth will bring forth\r\nmuch more abundant crops than at present, for the benefit of rapidly\r\npropagating mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n                 RADIATION AND CONSTITUTION OF THE SUN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question has often been discussed in past ages, and again in\r\nthe last century, in how far the position of our earth within the\r\nsolar system may be regarded as secure. One might apprehend two\r\nthings. Either the distance of the earth from the sun might increase\r\nor decrease, or the rotation of the earth about its axis might be\r\narrested; and either of these possibilities would threaten the\r\ncontinuance of life on the earth. The problem of the stability of\r\nthe solar system has been investigated by the astronomers, and their\r\npatrons have offered high prizes for a solution of the problem. If the\r\nsolar system consisted merely of the sun and the earth, the earth’s\r\nexistence would be secure for ages; but the other planets exercise a\r\ncertain, though small, influence upon the movements of the earth. That\r\nthis influence can only be of slight importance is due to the fact\r\nthat the total mass of all the planets does not aggregate more than\r\none-seven-hundred-and-fiftieth of the mass of the sun, and, further,\r\nto the fact that the planets all move in nearly circular orbits around\r\nthe centre, the sun, so that they never approach one another closely.\r\nThe calculations of the astronomers demonstrate that the disturbances\r\nof the earth’s orbit are merely periodical, representing long cycles\r\nof from 50,000 to 2,000,000 years. Thus the whole effect is limited to\r\na slight vacillation of the orbits of the planets about their mean\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nSo far everything is well and good. But our solar system is traversed\r\nby other celestial bodies, mostly of unknown, but certainly not of\r\ncircular orbits—namely, the comets. The fear of a collision with a\r\ncomet still alarmed the thinkers of the past century. Experience has,\r\nhowever, taught us that collisions between the earth and comets do not\r\nlead to any serious consequence. The earth has several times passed\r\nthrough the tails of comets—for instance, in 1819 and 1861—and it\r\nwas only the calculating astronomer who became aware of the fact. Once\r\non such an occasion we have thought that we observed a glow like that\r\nof an aurora in the sky. When the earth was drawing near the denser\r\nparts of the comet, particles fell on the earth in the shape of showers\r\nof shooting-stars, without doing any appreciable damage. The mass of\r\ncomets is too small perceptibly to disturb the paths of the planets.\r\n\r\nThe rotation of the earth about its axis should slowly be diminished by\r\nthe effects of the tides, since they act like a brake applied to the\r\nsurface of the earth. This retardation is, however, so unimportant that\r\nthe astronomers have not been able to establish it in historical times.\r\nThe slow shrinkage of the earth somewhat counteracts this effect.\r\nLaplace believed that we were able to deduce, from an analysis of the\r\nobservations of solar eclipses in ancient centuries, that the length of\r\nthe day had not altered by more than 0.01 second since the year 729 B.C.\r\n\r\nWe know that the sun, unaccompanied by its planets, is moving in space\r\ntowards the constellation of Hercules with a velocity of 20 km. (13\r\nmiles) per second, which is amazing to our terrestrial conceptions.\r\nPossibly the constituents of our solar system might collide with some\r\nother unknown celestial body on this journey. But as the celestial\r\nbodies are sparsely distributed, we may hope that many billions of\r\nyears will elapse before such a catastrophe will take place.\r\n\r\nIn mechanical respects the stability of our system appeared to be well\r\nestablished. Since the modern theory of heat has made its triumphant\r\nentry into natural science, however, the aspect of matters has changed.\r\nWe are convinced that all life and all motion on the earth can be\r\ntraced back to solar radiation. The tidal motions alone make a rather\r\nunimportant exception. We have to ask ourselves: Will not the store of\r\nenergy in the sun, which goes out, not only to the planets, but to a\r\nfar greater extent into unknown domains of cold space, come to an end,\r\nand will not that be the end of all the joys and sorrows of earthly\r\nexistence? The position appears desperate when we consider that only\r\none part in 2300 millions of the solar radiation benefits the earth,\r\nand perhaps ten times as much the whole system, with all its moons.\r\nThe solar radiation is so powerful that every gramme of the mass of\r\nthe sun loses two calories in the course of a year. If, therefore, the\r\nspecific heat of the sun were the same as that of water, which in this\r\nrespect surpasses most other substances, the solar temperature would\r\nfall by 2° Cent. (3.6° F.) every year. As, now, the temperature of the\r\nsun in its outer portion has been estimated at from 6000° to 7000°, the\r\nsun should have cooled completely within historical times. And though\r\nthe interior of the sun most probably has a vastly higher temperature\r\nthan the outer portions which we can observe, we should, all the\r\nsame, have to expect that the solar temperature and radiation would\r\nnoticeably have diminished in historical times. But all the documents\r\nfrom ancient Babylon and Egypt seem to point out that the climate at\r\nthe dawn of historical times was in those countries nearly the same as\r\nat present, and that, therefore, the sun shone over the most ancient\r\nrepresentatives of culture in the same way as it shines on their\r\ndescendants now.\r\n\r\nThe thesis has frequently been advanced, therefore, that the sun has\r\nin its heat balance not only an expenditure side, but also an almost\r\nequally substantial income side. The German physician R. Mayer,\r\nwho has the immortal merit of first having given expression to the\r\nconception of a relation between heat and mechanical work, directed his\r\nattention also to the household of the sun. He suggested that swarms\r\nof meteorites, rushing into the sun with an amazing velocity (of over\r\n600 km. per second), would, when stopped in their motion, generate\r\nheat at the rate of 45 million calories per gramme of meteorites. In\r\nfuture ages it would be the turn of the planets to sustain for some\r\ntime longer the spark of life in the sun, by the sacrifice of their\r\nown existences. The sun would therefore, like the god Saturn, have to\r\ndevour its own children in order to continue its existence. Of how\r\nlittle avail that would be we learn from the consideration that the\r\nfall of the earth into the sun would not be able to prolong the heat\r\nexpenditure of the sun by as many as a hundred years. By their rush\r\ninto the sun, almost uniformly from all sides, the meteorites would,\r\nmoreover, long since have put a stop to the rotation of the sun about\r\nits axis. Further, by virtue of the increasing mass and the hence\r\naugmenting attraction of the sun, the length of our year would have\r\nhad to diminish by about 2.8 seconds per year, which is in absolute\r\ncontradiction to the observations of the astronomers. According to\r\nMayer’s thesis, a corresponding number of meteorites would, finally,\r\nalso have to tumble upon the surface of the earth, and (according to\r\ndata which will be furnished in Chapter IV.) they should raise the\r\nsurface temperature to about 800°. The thesis is therefore misleading.\r\n\r\nWe must look for another explanation. It occurred to Helmholtz, one of\r\nthe most eminent investigators in the domain of the mechanical theory\r\nof heat, that, instead of the meteorites, parts of the sun itself\r\nmight fall towards its centre, or, in other words, that the sun was\r\nshrinking. Owing to the high gravitation of the sun (27.4 times greater\r\nthan on the surface of the earth), the shrinkage would liberate a great\r\namount of heat. Helmholtz calculated that, in order to cover the heat\r\nexpenditure of the sun, a shrinkage of its diameter by 60 m. annually\r\nwould be required. If the sun’s diameter should only be diminished by\r\none-hundredth of one per cent.—a change which we should not be able\r\nto establish—the heat loss would be covered for more than 2000 years.\r\nThat seems at first satisfactory. But if we proceed with our estimate,\r\nwe find that if the sun went on losing as much heat as at present for\r\nseventeen million years it would have to contract within this period to\r\na quarter of its present volume, and would therefore acquire a density\r\nlike that of the earth. Long before that, however, the radiation from\r\nthe sun would have been decreased so powerfully that the temperature\r\non the earth’s surface would no longer rise above freezing-point.\r\nHelmholtz, on this argument, limited the further existence of the\r\nearth to about six million years. That is less satisfactory. But we\r\nknow nothing of the future and must be content with possibilities. Not\r\nso, however, if we calculate back with the aid of Helmholtz’s theory.\r\nAccording to this theory, and according to Helmholtz’s own data, a\r\nstate like the present cannot have existed for more than ten million\r\nyears. Since, now, geologists have come to the conclusion that the\r\npetrefactions which we find in the fossil-bearing strata of the earth\r\nhave needed at least a hundred million years for their formation, and\r\nmore probably a thousand million years, and since, moreover, the still\r\nmore ancient formations—the so-called precambrian strata—have been\r\ndeposited in equally long or still longer periods, we see that the\r\ntheory of Helmholtz is unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nA somewhat peculiar way out of the dilemma has been suggested by a few\r\nscientists. We know that one gramme of the wonderful element radium\r\nemits about 120 calories per hour, or in the course of a year, in\r\nround numbers, a million calories. This radiation seems to continue\r\nunimpaired for years. If we now assume that each kilogramme of the mass\r\nof the sun contains only two milligrammes of radium, that amount would\r\nbe sufficient to balance the heat expenditure of the sun for all future\r\nages. Without some further auxiliary hypothesis, we can, however, not\r\nlisten to this suggestion. It presupposes that heat is created out\r\nof nothing. Some scientists, indeed, believe that radium may absorb\r\na radiation, coming from space, in some unknown manner and convert\r\nit into heat. Before we enter seriously into a discussion of this\r\nexplanation we shall have to answer the questions where that radiation\r\ncomes from and where it takes its store of energy.\r\n\r\nWe must, therefore, again search for another source of heat energy for\r\nthe sun. Before we can hope to find it, we had better study the sun\r\nitself a little.\r\n\r\nAll scientists are agreed that the sun is of the same constitution as\r\nthe thousands of luminous stars which we see in the sky. According to\r\nthe color of the light which they emit, stars are classified as white,\r\nyellow, and red stars. The differences in their light become much\r\nmore distinct when we examine them spectroscopically. In the white\r\nstars the helium and hydrogen lines predominate decidedly; the helium\r\nstars contain, in addition, oxygen. Metals are comparatively little\r\nrepresented; but they play a main part in the spectra of the yellow\r\nstars, in which, further, some bands become visible. In the spectra\r\nof the red stars we notice many bands which indicate that chemical\r\ncompounds are present in the outer portions. Everybody knows that the\r\nplatinum wire or the filament of an incandescent lamp which has been\r\nheated to incandescence by the electric current first shines reddish,\r\nthen yellow when the current is increased, and finally more and more\r\nwhite. At the same time the temperature rises. We can estimate the\r\ntemperature from the brightness of the glow. If we know the wave-length\r\nof the radiations of that color which emits the greatest amount of\r\nheat in the spectrum (it should be a normal spectrum), it is easy to\r\ncalculate the temperature of the star from Wien’s law of displacements.\r\nWe need only divide 2.89 by the respective wave-length expressed in\r\nmm. to find the absolute temperature of the star; by deducting 273\r\nfrom the result, we obtain the temperature in degrees Cent. on the\r\nordinary scale. For the sun the maximum of heat radiation lies near\r\nwave-length 0.00055 (in the greenish-yellow light), and therefore the\r\nabsolute temperature of the radiating disk of the sun, the so-called\r\nphotosphere, should be 5255° absolute, or nearly 5000° Cent. But our\r\natmosphere weakens the sunlight, and it also causes a displacement of\r\nthe maximum radiation in the spectrum. The same applies to the sun’s\r\nown atmosphere, so that we have to adopt a higher estimate than 5000°\r\nCent. By means of Stefan’s law of radiation, the solar temperature has\r\nbeen estimated at about 6200°, which would correspond to a wave-length\r\nof about 0.00045 mm. This correction is therefore significant. About\r\nhalf of it has to be ascribed to the influence of the solar atmosphere,\r\nthe other half to the terrestrial atmosphere. A Hungarian astronomer,\r\nHarkányi, has determined in the same way the temperature of several\r\nwhite stars (Vega and Sirius), and found it to be about 1000° higher\r\nthan that of the sun, while the red star Betelgeuse, the most prominent\r\nstar in Orion, would have a temperature by 2500° lower than that of the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nIt must expressly be stated that in making these estimates we\r\nunderstand by the temperature of the star in this case the temperature\r\nof a radiating body which emits the same light as that which reaches\r\nus from the star. But the stellar light undergoes important changes\r\non its way to us. We learn from observing new stars that a star may\r\nbe surrounded by a cloud of cosmical dust which sifts the blue rays\r\nout and permits the red ones to pass. The star then shines with a\r\nless brilliantly white light than in the absence of the cloud. The\r\nconsequence is that we estimate the temperature lower than it really\r\nis. In the red stars bands have been noticed, indicating, as we have\r\nalready said, the presence of chemical compounds. The most interesting\r\nof these are the compounds of cyanogen and of carbon, probably with\r\nhydrogen, which appear to resemble those observed by Swan in the\r\nspectrum of gas flames and which were named after him. It was formerly\r\nthought that the presence of these compounds implied lower temperature.\r\nBut we shall see that this conclusion is not firmly established. Hale\r\nhas found during eclipses of the sun that exactly the same compounds\r\noccur immediately above the luminous clouds of the sun. They are\r\nprobably more numerous below the clouds, where the temperature is no\r\ndoubt higher, than above them.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, we have reason to assume that the now yellow sun\r\nwas once a white star like the brilliant Sirius, that it has slowly\r\ncooled down to its present appearance, and that it will some day shine\r\nwith the reddish light of Betelgeuse. The sun will then only radiate a\r\nseventh of the heat which it emits now, and it is very likely that the\r\nearth will have been transformed into a glacial desert long before that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIt has already been pointed out that the atmospheres of both the sun\r\nand of the earth produce a strong absorption of the solar rays, and\r\nespecially of the blue and white rays. It is for this reason that the\r\nlight of the sun appears more red in the evening than at noon, because\r\nin the former case it has to pass through a thicker layer of air, which\r\nabsorbs the blue rays. For the same reason the limb of the sun appears\r\nmore red in spectroscopic examinations than the centre of the sun.\r\nThis weakening of the sun’s light is due to the fine dust pervading\r\nthe atmospheres of the earth and the sun. When the products of strong\r\nvolcanic eruptions, like the eruptions of Krakatoa in 1883 and of Mont\r\nPelée in 1902, filled the atmosphere with a fine volcanic dust, the sun\r\nappeared distinctly red when standing low in the horizon. It was this\r\ndust that caused the red glow.\r\n\r\nWhen we examine an image of the sun which has been thrown on a screen\r\nby the aid of a lens or a system of lenses, we notice on the sun’s\r\ndisk a mottling of characteristic darker spots. These spots struck the\r\nattention of Galileo, and they were discovered almost simultaneously by\r\nhim, by Fabricius, and by Scheiner (1610-1611). These spots have since\r\nbeen the most diligently studied features of the sun. We carefully\r\ndetermine their number and sizes, and combine these two data to make\r\nthe so-called sun-spot numbers. These numbers change from year to\r\nyear in a rather irregular way, the period amounting on an average to\r\n11.1 years. The spots appear in two belts on the sun, and they glide\r\nover the disk in the course of thirteen or fourteen days. Sometimes\r\nthey reappear after another thirteen or fourteen days. It is therefore\r\nbelieved that they lie comparatively quiet on the surface of the sun,\r\nand that the sun rotates about its own axis in about twenty-seven\r\ndays, so that after that period the same points are again opposite\r\nthe earth. This is the so-called synodical period. The great interest\r\nwhich attaches to the study of these features lies in the fact that\r\nsimultaneously with these spots several other phenomena seem to vary\r\nwhich attain their maxima at the same time. Such are, in the first\r\ninstance, the polar lights and the magnetic variations, and, to a\r\nlesser degree, the cirrus clouds and temperature changes, as well as\r\nseveral other meteorological phenomena (compare Chapter V.).\r\n\r\nAbout the sun-spots we notice the so-called faculæ—portions which are\r\nmuch brighter than their surroundings. When we carefully examine a\r\nstrongly magnified image of the sun, we find that it has a granulated\r\nappearance (Fig. 18). Langley compares the disk to a grayish-white\r\ncloth almost hidden by flakes of snow. The less bright portions are\r\ndesignated “pores,” the brighter portions “granules.” It is generally\r\nassumed that the granules correspond to clouds which rise like the\r\nclouds of our atmosphere on the top of ascending convection currents.\r\nBut while the terrestrial clouds are formed of drops of rain or of\r\ncrystals of ice, the granules consist probably of soot—that is to\r\nsay, condensed carbon—and of drops of metals, iron, and others. The\r\nsmallest granule which we are able to discern has a diameter of about\r\n200 km. (130 miles).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 18.—Sun-spot group and granulation of the\r\n    sun. (Photographed at the Meudon Observatory, near Paris, April\r\n    1, 1884)]\r\n\r\nThe faculæ are formed by very large accumulations of clouds which are\r\ncarried up by strong ascending currents and spread over large areas,\r\nas in our cyclones. The spots correspond to descending masses of gas\r\nwith rising temperatures, which are therefore “dry” and do not carry\r\nany clouds, as in terrestrial anticyclones. Through these holes in the\r\nwalls of solar clouds we peep a little farther into the gigantic masses\r\nof gas, and we obtain an idea of the state of affairs in the deeper\r\nstrata of the sun. The depth of the wall of cloud is, of course, not\r\nlarge compared to the radius of the sun.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 19.—Part of the solar spectrum of January\r\n    3, 1872. After Langley. The bright horizontal bands are due\r\n    to prominences. In the middle (at 208) the hydrogen line F,\r\n    strongly distorted by violent agitation]\r\n\r\nThe study of the spectra affords us the best insight into the nature\r\nof the different parts of the sun. The spectra teach us not only the\r\nconstituents of these parts, but also the velocities with which they\r\nmove. We have learned in this way that, lying above the luminous\r\nclouds of the sun which are radiating to us, there are great masses\r\nof gas containing most of our terrestrial elements. We distinguish\r\nparticularly in them iron, magnesium, calcium, sodium, helium, and\r\nhydrogen. The two last-mentioned constituents, being the least dense,\r\nare found particularly in the outermost strata of the atmosphere. The\r\nsolar atmosphere becomes visible when, during an eclipse of the sun,\r\nthe disk of the moon has proceeded so far as to cover the intensely\r\nluminous clouds in the so-called photosphere. Owing to its strong\r\npercentage of hydrogen, the gaseous atmosphere generally shines in the\r\npurple hue which is characteristic of this element. This stratum of gas\r\nis also called the chromosphere (from the Greek word χρῶμα, meaning\r\ncolor). Its thickness is estimated at from 7000 to 9000 km. (5000 to\r\n6000 miles). From it rise rays of fire over the surrounding surface\r\nlike blades of grass on meadows, to which their appearance has been\r\nlikened.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 20.—Metallic prominences in vortex motion.\r\n    The white spot marks the size of the earth]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 21.—Fountain-like metallic prominences]\r\n\r\nWhen these flames rise still higher, to about 15,000 km. (9300 miles)\r\nor more, they are called protuberances or prominences. Their number\r\nas well as their altitude grow with the number of sun-spots. They are\r\ndistinguished as metallic and as quiet prominences. The former are\r\ncharacterized by particularly violent motion, as will become apparent\r\nfrom Figs. 20 and 21, and they contain large amounts of metallic\r\nvapor. They appear only within the belt of sun-spots which are most\r\npronounced at a distance of about 20° from the solar equator. Their\r\nmovements are so violent that they often traverse several hundreds of\r\nkilometres in a second. The Hungarian Fényi observed, indeed, on July\r\n15, 1895, a prominence whose greatest velocity in the line of sight,\r\nmeasured spectroscopically, amounted to 862 km. (536 miles), and whose\r\nmaximum velocity at right angles to this direction was 840 km. per\r\nsecond. These colossal velocities distinguish the highest parts, while\r\nthe lower portions, which are the most dense and which contain most\r\nmetallic vapor, are less mobile, as might be expected. Their altitude\r\nabove the sun’s surface may reach exceedingly high figures, and this\r\napplies also to the quiet prominences. The above-mentioned prominence\r\nof July 15, 1895, reached a height of 500,000 km., and Langley\r\nobserved, on October 7, 1880, one at an altitude of 560,000 km., whose\r\ntip, therefore, nearly attained an elevation equal to that of a radius\r\nof the sun, 690,000 km. above the limb of the sun’s photosphere. The\r\nmean altitude of these prominences is 40,000 km. After their discovery\r\nby Lector Vassenius, of Götheborg, in 1733, they could only be studied\r\nduring total solar eclipses, until Lockyer and Janssen taught us, in\r\nthe year 1868, how to observe them in full sunlight by means of the\r\nspectroscope.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 22.—Quiet prominences of smoke-column type]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 23.—Quiet prominences, shape of a tree. The\r\n    white spot indicates the size of the earth]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 24.—Diagram illustrating the differences\r\n    in the spectra of sun-spots and of the photosphere. Some lines\r\n    in the spot spectrum are stronger, others fainter, than in the\r\n    photosphere spectrum. In the central portion, two reversals; to\r\n    the right, two bands. After Mitchell]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 25.—Spectrum of a sun-spot, the central\r\n    band between the two portions of the photosphere spectrum. The\r\n    spot spectrum is bordered with the half-shadows of the edge of\r\n    the spot. After Mitchell]\r\n\r\nThe quiet prominences consist almost exclusively of hydrogen and\r\nhelium; sometimes they contain also traces of metallic gases. They\r\nresemble clouds floating quietly in the solar atmosphere, or masses\r\nof smoke coming from a chimney. They may appear anywhere on the sun,\r\nand their stability is so great that they have sometimes been watched\r\nduring a complete solar rotation (for about forty days); this is\r\npossible only when they occur in the neighborhood of the poles, where\r\nthey always remain visible outside the sun’s limb. Figs. 22 and 23 show\r\nseveral such prominences according to Young.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 26.—The great sun-spot of October 9,\r\n    1903. Taken with the photo-heliograph of Greenwich in the\r\n    usual manner. The spot is shown at mean level of the calcium\r\n    faculæ. The two following photographs show a lower-level and a\r\n    higher-level section through the calcium faculæ]\r\n\r\nSometimes the matter of the prominences seems to fall back upon the\r\nsurface of the sun between the smaller flames of fire which we have\r\nlikened to blades of grass (Fig. 21). In most cases, however, the\r\nprominences appear slowly to dissolve. When their brilliant glow fades\r\nowing to their intense radiation, they can no longer be observed. The\r\nquiet prominences, which seem to float at heights of about 50,000 km.\r\nand at still greater heights, must there be almost in a vacuum. Their\r\nparticles cannot be supported by any surrounding gases, after the\r\nmanner of the drops of water in terrestrial clouds. In order that they\r\nmay remain floating they must be pushed away from the sun by a peculiar\r\nforce—the radiation pressure (see Chapter IV.).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 27.—The great sun-spot of October 9, 1903.\r\n    Photograph of the low-level calcium faculæ with the aid of the\r\n    light of the calcium line H. The spot is not obscured by the\r\n    faculæ—at least, not so much as in the following illustrations]\r\n\r\nThe faculæ can be studied in the same way as the prominences, and\r\nof late Deslandres and Hale have used for this purpose a special\r\ninstrument, the heliograph (compare Figs. 26 to 29). When the faculæ\r\napproach the limb of the sun they appear particularly brilliant by\r\ncomparison with their surroundings. That seems to indicate that they\r\nare lying at a great altitude, and that their light is hence not\r\nweakened by the superposed hazy stratum. When they reach the sun’s\r\nlimb they appear to us like raised portions of the photosphere. The\r\nclouds which form these faculæ are carried upward by powerful ascending\r\nstreams of gas whose expansion is due to the diminution of the gaseous\r\npressure.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 28.—The great sun-spot of October 9, 1903.\r\n    Photograph of the higher-level calcium faculæ, taken with the\r\n    light of the central portion of the line H (calcium). The\r\n    higher-level faculæ hide the spot, indicating that the faculæ\r\n    spread considerably during their ascent]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 29.—The great sun-spot of October 9, 1903.\r\n    Photograph of the hydrogen faculæ, taken with the light of the\r\n    spectral line F (hydrogen). Only the darkest portions of the\r\n    spot are visible. The other portions are obscured by masses of\r\n    the hydrogen, which were evidently in a restless state]\r\n\r\nSun-spots display many peculiarities in their spectra (Figs. 24 and\r\n25). Very prominent is always the helium line; prominent likewise the\r\ndark sodium lines, which are markedly widened and which show in their\r\nmiddle portions a bright line—the so-called reversal of lines (Fig.\r\n24). This occurrence indicates that the metal is lying in a deeper\r\nstratum. In the red portion of the spectrum we find bands, just as in\r\nthe spectra of the red stars. These bands, which appear to be resolved\r\ninto crowds of lines by the aid of powerful instruments, indicate the\r\npresence of chemical compounds. Since the spot is comparatively of\r\nfeeble intensity, its spectrum appears superposed like a less bright\r\nribbon upon the background of the spectrum of the more luminous\r\nphotosphere. The violet end of the sun-spot spectrum is particularly\r\nweakened. Although the spot has the appearance of a pit in the\r\nphotosphere, and when on the sun’s limb makes it look as if a piece had\r\nbeen cut out of the edge, it yet does not appear darker than the sun’s\r\nedge. That points to the conclusion that the light emitted by the spot\r\nemanates chiefly from its upper, cold portions.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 30.—Photograph of the solar corona of 1900.\r\n    (After Langley and Abbot.) Illustrating the appearance of the\r\n    corona in years of minimum sun-spot frequency]\r\n\r\nThe light coming from the deeper portions is distinctly absorbed to\r\na large degree by the higher-lying strata. The sun-spots also appear\r\nto become narrower in their lower parts, owing to the compression of\r\nthe gases at greater depths, and one may regard their funnel-shaped\r\ncloud-walls as “half-shadows,” which appear darker than the\r\nsurroundings, but brighter than the so-called core of the spot. The\r\nweakening of the violet end of the spectrum is probably due to the\r\npresence of fine particles of dust in the solar gases, just as they\r\ncause the corresponding weakening of the violet end of the spectrum of\r\nthe sun’s limb. The bands in the red parts of the sun-spot spectrum may\r\noriginate from the deeper portions of the spot, because all the higher\r\nparts of the solar atmosphere yield simple, sharp lines. The bands\r\nsuggest that chemical compounds can exist at the higher pressure of the\r\ninner portions of the sun, and that these compounds are decomposed\r\nin the outer parts of the sun, to give the line spectra of chemical\r\nelements.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 31.—Photograph of the solar corona of 1870.\r\n    (After Davis.) The year 1870 was one of maximum sun-spot frequency]\r\n\r\nThe enigmatical corona lies farther out in the atmosphere of the sun.\r\nIt consists of streamers which may extend beyond the disk of the sun to\r\nthe length of several solar diameters. The corona can only be observed\r\nat total eclipses of the sun. Figs. 30 to 32 illustrate the appearance\r\nof this very peculiar phenomenon.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 32.—Photograph of the solar corona of 1898.\r\n    (After Maunder.) 1898 was a year of average solar activity]\r\n\r\nWhen the number of sun-spots is small, the corona streamers extend like\r\nhuge brooms from the equatorial parts, and the feebler rays of the\r\ncorona near the solar poles are then bent downward to the equator, just\r\nlike the lines of force about the poles of a magnet (Fig. 30).\r\n\r\nWe suppose, for this reason, that the sun acts like a strong magnet,\r\nwhose poles are situated near the geographical poles of the sun. In\r\nyears which are richer in sun-spots the distribution of the streamers\r\nof the corona is more uniform. At moderate sun-spot frequency, large\r\nnumbers of rays seem to emanate from the neighborhood of the maximum\r\nbelt of sun-spots, so that the corona often assumes a quadrangular\r\nshape (compare Fig. 32).\r\n\r\nThese remarks hold for the “outer corona,” while the inner portion,\r\nthe so-called “inner corona,” shines in a more uniform light. The\r\nspectroscopic examination demonstrates that the light consists\r\nmainly of hydrogen gas and of an unknown gas designated coronium,\r\nwhich particularly seems to occur in the higher parts of the inner\r\ncorona. The outer streamers of the corona, on the contrary, yield a\r\ncontinuous spectrum which shows that the light is radiated by solid or\r\nliquid particles. In the spectrum of the coronal rays at an extreme\r\ndistance from the disk, astronomers have sometimes fancied that they\r\ndiscerned dark lines on a bright ground, just as in the spectrum of the\r\nphotosphere. It has been assumed that this light is reflected sunlight,\r\noriginating from small solid or liquid particles of the outer corona.\r\nIt must be reflected, because it is partly polarized. The radiating\r\ndisposition of the outer corona indicates the action of a force, the\r\nradiation pressure, which drives the smaller particles away from the\r\ncentre of the sun.\r\n\r\nAs regards the temperature of the sun, we have already seen that\r\nthe two methods applied for its determination have yielded somewhat\r\nunequal results. From the intensity of the radiation, Christiansen,\r\nand afterwards Warburg, calculated a temperature of about 6000° Cent.\r\nWilson and Gray found for the centre of the sun 6200°, which they\r\nafterwards corrected into 8000°. Owing to the absorption of light by\r\nthe terrestrial and the solar atmospheres, we always find too low\r\nvalues. That applies, to a still greater extent, to any estimate based\r\nupon the determination of that wave-length for which the heat emission\r\nfrom the solar spectrum is maximum. Le Chatelier compared the intensity\r\nof sunlight filtered through red glass with the intensities of light\r\nfrom several terrestrial sources of fairly well-known temperatures\r\ntreated in the same way. These estimates yielded to him a solar\r\ntemperature of 7600° Cent. Most scientists reckon with an absolute\r\ntemperature of 6500°, corresponding to about 6200° Celsius. That is\r\nwhat is known as the “effective temperature” of the sun. If the solar\r\nrays were not partially absorbed, this temperature would correspond\r\nto that of the clouds of the photosphere. Since red light is little\r\nabsorbed comparatively, Le Chatelier’s value of 7600°, and the almost\r\nequal value of Wilson and Gray of 8000°, should approximately represent\r\nthe average temperature of the outer portions of the clouds of the\r\nphotosphere. The higher temperature of the faculæ is evident from\r\ntheir greater light intensity, which, however, may partly be due to\r\ntheir greater height. Carrington and Hodgson saw, on September 1,\r\n1859, two faculæ break out from the edge of a sun-spot. Their splendor\r\nwas five or six times greater than that of the surrounding parts of\r\nthe photosphere. That would correspond to a temperature of about\r\n10,000 or 12,000° Cent. The deeper parts of the sun which broke out on\r\nthese occasions evidently have a higher temperature, and this is not\r\nunnatural, since the sun is losing heat by radiation from its outer\r\nportions.\r\n\r\nWe know that the temperature of our atmosphere decreases with greater\r\nheights. The movements of the air are concerned in this change. A\r\nsinking mass of air is compressed by the increased pressure to which\r\nit is being exposed, and its temperature rises, therefore, just as\r\nthe temperature rises in a pneumatic gas-lighter when the piston is\r\npressed down. If the air were dry and in strong vertical motion, its\r\ntemperature would change by 10° Cent. (18° F.) per km. If it stood\r\nstill, it would assume an almost uniform temperature; that is to say,\r\nthere would be no lowering of the temperature as we proceed upward. The\r\nactual value lies between the two extremes. As the gravitation in the\r\nphotosphere of the sun is 27.4 times greater than on the surface of the\r\nearth, we can deduce that, if the air on the sun were as dense as on\r\nthe earth, the temperature on the sun would vary 27.4 times as much as\r\non the earth with the increasing height—that is to say, by 270 degrees\r\nper kilometre, provided its atmosphere were in violent agitation. Now,\r\nthe outer portions of the solar atmosphere are, indeed, in violent\r\nmotion, so that this latter assumption seems to be justified. But\r\nthis part consists essentially of hydrogen, which is 29 times lighter\r\nthan the air. We must, therefore, reduce the value at which we arrive\r\nto one-twenty-ninth. As a result, the final temperature gradient per\r\nkilometre would only be 9° Cent. (16.2° F.). But the radiation is\r\nextremely powerful on the sun, and it tends to equalize the conditions.\r\nNine degrees per kilometre is therefore, without doubt, too high a\r\nvalue. Further, in the interior of the sun the gases are much heavier.\r\nAt a small depth, however, they will be so strongly compressed by the\r\nupper strata that their further compressibility will be limited, and\r\nthe calculation which we have just made loses its validity. Yet, in any\r\ncase, the temperature of the sun must increase as we penetrate nearer\r\nto its centre. If we accept a temperature gradient per kilometre of\r\nthe value above indicated, 9°—it is three times greater in the solid\r\nearth-crust—we should obtain for the centre of the sun a temperature\r\nof more than six million degrees.\r\n\r\nAll substances melt and evaporate as their temperature is raised. If\r\nthe temperature exceeds a certain limit, the “critical temperature,”\r\nthe substance can no longer be condensed to a liquid, however high the\r\npressure may be pushed, and the substance will only exist as a gas.\r\nIf we start from -273° as absolute zero, this critical temperature is\r\nnearly one and a half times as high as the ebullition temperature of\r\nthe substance under atmospheric pressure. So far as our experience\r\ngoes, it does not appear probable that the critical temperature of any\r\nsubstance could be higher than 10,000° or 12,000° Cent., the highest\r\nvalues which we have calculated for the temperature of the faculæ. The\r\ninner portions of the sun must hence be gaseous, and the whole sun\r\nbe a strongly compressed mass of gas of extremely high temperature,\r\nwhich, owing to the high pressure, is at a density 1.4 times as great\r\nas that of water, and which in many respects, therefore, will resemble\r\na liquid. It must, for instance, be extremely viscid, and that accounts\r\nfor the relatively great stability of the sun-spots (one sun-spot held\r\nout for a year and a half in 1840 and 1841). The sun would thus have\r\nto be regarded as a sphere of gas, in the outer portions of which a\r\ncertain amount of condensations of cloud character have taken place,\r\nowing to radiation and to the outward movements of the gaseous masses.\r\nThe pressure in the photosphere—that is, in those parts in which these\r\nclouds are floating—has been averaged at five or six atmospheres, a\r\nfigure which, considering the very high gravitation, would suggest\r\na layer of superposed gas above it corresponding to not more than a\r\nfifth of our terrestrial atmosphere. At an approximately corresponding\r\nheight, 11,500 m. (38,000 ft.), there are floating in the terrestrial\r\natmosphere the highest cirrus clouds, to which the clouds of the\r\nphotosphere may in many respects be compared.\r\n\r\nWe turn back to the unanswered question whence the sun takes the\r\ncompensation for the heat which it constantly radiates into space. The\r\nmost powerful source of heat known to us is that of chemical reactions.\r\nThe most familiar reaction of daily life is the combustion of coal.\r\nBy burning one gramme of carbon we obtain 8000 calories. If the sun\r\nconsisted of pure carbon, its energy would not hold out more than 4000\r\nyears. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that most scientists\r\nsoon abandoned the hope of solving the problem in this way. The French\r\nastronomer Faye attempted to explain the replenishment of the losses of\r\nheat by radiation from the sun by arguments in which he resorted to the\r\nheat of a combination of the constituents of the sun. He said: “So high\r\na temperature must prevail in the interior of the sun that everything\r\nthere will be decomposed into its elementary constituents. When the\r\natoms afterwards penetrate into the outer layers, they are again\r\nunited, and they liberate heat.” Faye thus imagined that new masses of\r\nelements would constantly rise from the interior of the sun and would\r\nbe reunited in chemical combination on the surface. But if new masses\r\nare to penetrate upward to the surface, those which were at first above\r\nmust go back to the centre of the sun, in order to be re-decomposed\r\nby the great heat there; and this re-decomposition would consume just\r\nas much heat as was gained by the rising of the same masses to the\r\nsurface. This convection can therefore only help to transport the store\r\nof heat from the interior to the surface. The total amount of heat\r\nstored in the sun would in this way, supposing the mean temperature to\r\nbe six million degrees, be able to cover the heat expenditure for about\r\nthree million years.\r\n\r\nWe have, moreover, seen that the highest strata of the sun are\r\ndistinguished by line spectra, suggestive of simple chemical compounds,\r\nwhile at greater depth in the sun-spots chemical combinations occur\r\nwhich are characterized by band spectra. It is quite incorrect to\r\nassert that high temperatures must necessarily decompose all chemical\r\ncompounds into their elements. The mechanical theory of heat teaches\r\nus only that at rising temperatures products are formed whose\r\nformation goes hand in hand with an absorption of heat. Thus, at a\r\nhigh temperature, ozone is formed from oxygen, although ozone is more\r\ncomplex in composition than oxygen, and by this reaction 750 calories\r\nare consumed when one gramme of oxygen is transformed into one gramme\r\nof ozone. We likewise know that in the electric arc, at a temperature\r\nof about 3000°, a compound is formed under consumption of heat by the\r\noxygen and nitrogen of the atmosphere. A new method for the technical\r\npreparation of nitric acid from the nitrogen of the air is based upon\r\nthis reaction. Again, the well-known compounds benzene and acetylene\r\nare formed from their elements, carbon and hydrogen, under absorption\r\nof heat. All these bodies can only be synthesized from their elementary\r\nconstituents at high temperatures. We further know from experience\r\nthat the higher the temperature at which a reaction takes place, the\r\ngreater, in general, the amount of heat which it absorbs.\r\n\r\nA similar law applies to the influence of pressure. When the pressure\r\nis increased, such processes will be favored as will yield products of\r\na smaller volume. If we imagine that a mass of gas rushes down from a\r\nhigher stratum of the sun into the depths of the sun’s interior, as\r\ngases do in sun-spots, complex compounds will be produced by virtue\r\nof the increased pressure. This pressure must increase at an immense\r\nrate towards the interior of the sun, by about 3500 atmospheres\r\nper kilometre. The gases which dissociate into atoms at the lower\r\npressures and the higher temperatures of the extreme solar strata above\r\nthe photosphere clouds enter into chemical combination in the depths\r\nof the spots, as we learn from spectroscopic examination. Owing to\r\ntheir high temperatures, these compounds absorb enormous quantities of\r\nheat in their building up, and these quantities of heat are to those\r\nwhich are concerned in the chemical processes of the earth in the same\r\nratio as the temperature of the sun is to that at which the chemical\r\nreactions are proceeding on the earth. As these gases penetrate\r\nfarther into the sun, temperature and pressure are still more and more\r\nincreased, and there will result products more and more abounding in\r\nenergy and concentration. We may, therefore, imagine the interior\r\nof the sun charged with compounds which, brought to the surface of\r\nthe sun, would dissociate under an enormous evolution of heat and an\r\nenormous increase of volume. These compounds have to be regarded as\r\nthe most powerful blasting agents, by comparison with which dynamite\r\nand gun-cotton would appear like toys. In confirmation of this view,\r\nwe observe that gases when penetrating into the photosphere clouds are\r\nable to eject prominences at a stupendous velocity, obtaining several\r\nhundred kilometres per second. This velocity surpasses that of the\r\nswiftest rifle-bullet about a thousandfold. We may hence ascribe to\r\nthe explosives which are confined in the interior of the sun energies\r\nwhich must be a million times greater than the energy of our blasting\r\nagents. (For the energy increases with the square of the velocity.)\r\nAnd yet these solar blasting agents have already given up a large part\r\nof their energy during their passage from the sun’s interior. It thus\r\nbecomes conceivable that the solar energy—instead of holding out for\r\n4000 years, as it would if it depended upon the combustion of a solar\r\nsphere made out of carbon—will last for something like four thousand\r\nmillion years. Perhaps we may further extend this period to several\r\nbillions.\r\n\r\nThat there are such energetic compounds we have learned from the\r\ndiscovery of the heat evolution of radium. According to Rutherford,\r\nradium is decomposed by one-half in the space of about 1300 years. In\r\nthis decomposition a quantity of about a million calories is evolved\r\nper gramme and per year, and we thus find that the decomposition of\r\nradium into its final products is accompanied by a heat evolution of\r\nabout two thousand millions of calories per gramme—about a quarter of\r\na million times more heat than the combustion of one gramme of carbon\r\nwould yield.\r\n\r\nIn chemical respects as well, then, the earth is a dwarf compared to\r\nthe sun, and we have every reason to presume that the chemical energy\r\nof the sun will be sufficient to sustain the solar heat during many\r\nthousand millions and possibly billions of years to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV\r\n\r\n                        THE RADIATION PRESSURE\r\n\r\n\r\nNext to simple measuring and simple calculations, astronomy appears\r\nto be the most ancient science. Yet, though man has worshipped the\r\nsun from the most remote ages, it was not fully comprehended before\r\nthe middle of the past century that the sun is the source of all life\r\nand of all motion. Part of the veneration for the sun was transferred\r\nto the moon, with its mild light, and to the smaller celestial\r\nlights. It did not escape notice that their positions in the sky\r\nwere always changing simultaneously with the annual variations in\r\nthe weather, and all human undertakings depended upon the weather\r\nand the seasons. The moon and the stars were worshipped—we know\r\nnow, without any justification whatever—as ruling over the weather,\r\nand consequently over man’s fate.[6] Before anything was undertaken\r\npeople attempted first to assure themselves of the favorable aspect\r\nof the constellations, and since the most remote ages astrologers\r\nhave exercised a vast influence over the ignorant and superstitious\r\nmultitude.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: The moon strongly, and more than any other agent,\r\n    influences the tides. Apart from this effect the position of\r\n    the moon has only a feeble influence upon the air pressure and\r\n    upon atmospheric electricity and terrestrial magnetism. The\r\n    influence of the stars is imperceptible.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the vehement enunciation of Giordano Bruno (1548-1600),\r\nthis superstition was still deeply rooted when Newton succeeded in\r\nproving, in 1686, that the movements of the so-called wandering stars,\r\nor planets, and of their moons could be calculated with the aid of\r\none very simple law: that all these celestial bodies are attracted\r\nby the sun or by their respective central bodies with a force which\r\nis proportional to their own mass and to the mass of the central\r\nbody and inversely proportional to the square of their distance from\r\nthat central body. Newton’s contemporary, Halley, applied the law of\r\ngravitation also to the mysterious comets, and calculating astronomy\r\nhas since been based upon this, its firmest law, to which there has\r\nnot been found any exception. The world was thus at once rid of\r\nthe paralyzing superstition which exacted belief in a mysterious\r\nruling of the stars. The contemporaries of Newton, as well as their\r\ndescendants, have rightly valued this discovery more highly than any\r\nother scientific triumph of this hero’s. According to Newton’s law, all\r\nmaterial bodies would tend to become more and more concentrated and\r\nunited, and the development of the universe would result in the sucking\r\nup of the smaller celestial bodies—the meteorites, for instance—by\r\nthe larger bodies.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be remarked that Newton’s great precursor, Kepler,\r\nobserved in 1618 that the matter of the comets is repelled by the sun.\r\nLike Newton, he believed in the corpuscular theory of light. The sun\r\nand all other luminous bodies radiated light, they thought, because\r\nthey ejected minute corpuscles of light matter in all directions.\r\nIf, now, these small corpuscles hit against the dust particles in\r\nthe comets’ tails, the dust particles would be carried away with\r\nthem, and their repulsion by the sun would become intelligible. It\r\nis characteristic that Newton would not admit this explanation of\r\nKepler’s, although he shared Kepler’s opinion on the nature of light.\r\nAccording to Newton, the deviation of the tails of comets from his\r\nlaw of general attraction was only apparent. The tails of comets, he\r\nargued, behaved like the columns of smoke rising from a chimney, which,\r\nalthough the gases of combustion are attracted by the earth, yet ascend\r\nbecause they are lighter than the surrounding air. This view, which has\r\nbeen characterized by Newcomb as no longer to be seriously taken into\r\nconsideration, demonstrates the strong tendency of Newton to explain\r\neverything with the aid of his law.\r\n\r\nThe astronomers followed faithfully in the footsteps of their\r\ninimitable master, Newton, and they brushed aside every phenomenon\r\nwhich would not fit into his system. An exception was made by the\r\nfamous Euler, who, in 1746, expressed the opinion that the waves of\r\nlight exerted a pressure upon the body upon which they fell. This\r\nopinion, however, could not prevail against the criticisms with which\r\nothers, and especially De Mairan, assailed it. That Euler was right,\r\nhowever, was proved by Maxwell’s great theoretical treatise on the\r\nnature of electricity (1873). He showed that rays of heat—and the\r\nsame applies, as Bartoli established in 1876, to radiations of any\r\nkind—must exercise a pressure just as great as the amount of energy\r\ncontained in a unit volume, by virtue of their radiation. Maxwell\r\ncalculated the magnitude of this pressure, and he found it so small\r\nthat it could hardly have been demonstrated with the experimental means\r\nthen at our disposal. But this demonstration has since been furnished,\r\nwith the aid of measurements obtained in a vacuum, by the Russian\r\nLebedeff and by the Americans Nichols and Hull (1900, 1901). They have\r\nfound that this pressure, the so-called radiation pressure, is exactly\r\nas great as Maxwell predicted.\r\n\r\nIn spite of Maxwell’s great authority, astronomers quite overlooked\r\nthis important law of his. Lebedeff, indeed, tried in 1892 to apply it\r\nto the tails of comets, which he regarded as gaseous; but the law is\r\nnot applicable in this case. As late as the year 1900, shortly before\r\nLebedeff was able to publish his experimental verification of this\r\nlaw, I attempted to prove its vast importance for the explanation of\r\nseveral celestial phenomena. The magnitude of the radiation pressure\r\nof the solar atmosphere must be equivalent to 2.75 milligrammes if the\r\nrays strike vertically against a black body one square centimetre in\r\narea. I also calculated the size of a spherule of the same specific\r\ngravity as water, such that the radiation pressure to which it would be\r\nexposed in the vicinity of the sun would balance the attraction by the\r\nsun. It resulted that equilibrium would be established if the diameter\r\nof the sphere were 0.0015 mm. A correction supplied by Schwarzschild\r\nshowed that the calculation was only valid when the sphere completely\r\nreflects all the rays which fall upon it. If the diameter of the\r\nspherule be still smaller, the radiation pressure will prevail over\r\nthe attraction, and such a sphere would be repelled by the sun. Owing\r\nto the refraction of light, this will, according to Schwarzschild,\r\nfurther necessitate that the circumference of the spherule should be\r\ngreater than 0.3 times the wave-length of the incident rays. When the\r\nsphere becomes still smaller, gravitation will once more predominate.\r\nBut spherules whose sizes are intermediate between these two limits\r\nwill be repelled. It results, therefore, that molecules, which have far\r\nsmaller dimensions than those mentioned, will not be repelled by the\r\nradiation pressure, and that therefore Maxwell’s law does not hold for\r\ngases. When the circumference of the spherule becomes exactly equal to\r\nthe wave-length of the radiation, the radiation pressure will act at\r\nits maximum, and it will then surpass gravity not less than nineteen\r\ntimes. These calculations apply to all spheres, totally reflecting\r\nthe light, of a specific gravity like water, and to a radiation and\r\nattraction corresponding to that of the sun. Since the sunlight is not\r\nhomogeneous, the maximum effect will somewhat be diminished, and it\r\nis nearly equal to ten times the gravity for spheres of a diameter of\r\nabout 0.00016 mm.[7]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: One centimetre of water contains 470 billions of\r\n    these spheres. Such a little drop of water, again, contains 96\r\n    millions of molecules, and there are probably organisms which\r\n    are smaller than these drops. Compare the experiments with\r\n    ultra-microscopic organisms by E. Raehlmann, N. Gaidukow, and\r\n    others.]\r\n\r\nBefore we had recourse to the radiation pressure for the explanation\r\nof the repulsion phenomena such as have been observed in the tails of\r\ncomets, it was generally believed with Zöllner that the repulsion was\r\ndue to electrical forces. Electricity undoubtedly plays an important\r\npart in these phenomena, as we shall see. The way in which it acts\r\nin these instances was explained by a discovery of C. T. R. Wilson\r\nin 1899. Gases can in various ways be transformed into conductors of\r\nelectricity which as a rule they do not conduct. The conducting gases\r\nare said to be ionized—that is to say, they contain free ions, minute\r\nparticles charged with positive or negative electricity. Gases can be\r\nionized, among other ways, by being radiated upon with Röntgen rays,\r\nkathode rays, or ultra-violet light, as well as by strong heat. Since\r\nthe light of the sun contains a great many ultra-violet radiations, it\r\nis indisputable that the masses of gases in the neighborhood of the sun\r\n(_e.g._, probably in comets when they come near the sun) will partly\r\nbe ionized, and will contain both positive and negative ions. Ionized\r\ngases are endowed with the remarkable capability of condensing vapors\r\nupon themselves. Wilson showed that this property is possessed to a\r\nhigher degree by the negative ions than by the positive ions (in the\r\ncondensation of water vapor). If there are, therefore, water vapors in\r\nthe neighborhood of the sun which can be condensed by cooling, drops of\r\nwater will, in the first instance, be condensed upon the negative ions.\r\nWhen these drops are afterwards repelled by the radiation pressure,\r\nor when they sink, owing to gravity, as drops of rain sink in the\r\nterrestrial atmosphere, they will carry with them the charge of the\r\nnegative ions, while the corresponding positive charge will remain\r\nbehind in the gas or in the air. In this way the negative and positive\r\ncharges will become separated from each other, and electric discharges\r\nmay ensue if sufficiently large quantities of opposite electricity have\r\nbeen accumulated. By reason of these discharges the gases will become\r\nluminescent, although their temperature may be very low. Stark has even\r\nshown that low temperatures are favorable for the display of a strong\r\nluminosity in electric discharges.\r\n\r\nWe have stated that Kepler, as early as the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century, came to the conclusion that the tails of comets\r\nwere repelled by the sun. Newton indicated how we might, from the shape\r\nof the comets’ tails, calculate their velocity. The best way, however,\r\nis to determine this velocity by direct observation. The comets’ tails\r\nare not so uniform in appearance as they are generally represented in\r\nillustrations, but they often contain several luminous nuclei (Fig.\r\n33), whose motions can be directly ascertained.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 33.—Photograph of Roerdam’s comet (1893\r\n    II.), suggesting several strong nuclei in the tail]\r\n\r\nFrom a study of the movements of comets’ tails, Olbers concluded,\r\nabout the beginning of the last century, that the repulsion of the\r\ncomets’ tails by the sun is inversely proportional to the square of\r\ntheir distance—that is to say, that the force of the repulsion is\r\nsubject to the same law as the force of gravitation. We can, therefore,\r\nexpress the repulsion effect in units of solar gravitation, and this\r\nhas generally been done. That the radiation pressure will in the same\r\nmanner change with the distance is only natural. For the radiation\r\nagainst the same surface is also inversely proportional to the square\r\nof the distance from the radiating body, the sun.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 34.—Photograph of Swift’s comet (1892 I.)]\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the past century the Russian astronomer Bredichin\r\nconducted a great many measurements on the magnitude of the forces with\r\nwhich comets’ tails are repelled by the sun. He considered himself,\r\non the strength of these measurements, justified in dividing comets’\r\ntails into three classes. In the first class the repulsion was 19 times\r\nstronger than gravitation; in the second class, from 3.2 to 1.5 times\r\nstronger; and in the third class, from 1.3 to 1 times stronger. Still\r\nhigher values have, however, been deduced for several comets. Thus\r\nHussey found for the comet of 1893 (Roerdam’s comet, 1893 II., Fig. 33)\r\na repulsion 37 times as strong as gravitation; and Swift’s comet (1892\r\nI.) yields the still higher value of 40.5 (Fig. 34). Some comets show\r\nseveral tails of different kinds, as the famous comet of Donati (Fig.\r\n35). Its two almost straight tails would belong to the first class, and\r\nthe more strongly developed and curved third tail to the second class.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 35.—Donati’s comet at its greatest\r\n    brilliancy in 1858]\r\n\r\nSchwarzschild, as already stated, calculated that small spherules\r\nreflecting all the incident light and of the specific gravity of water\r\nwould be repelled by the sun with a force that might balance ten times\r\ntheir weight. For a spherule absorbing all the light falling upon\r\nit this figure would be reduced to five times the weight. The small\r\nparticles of comets which, according to spectroscopic observations,\r\nprobably consist of hydrocarbons are not perfectly absorbing, but they\r\npermit certain rays of the sun to pass. A closer calculation shows that\r\nin this case forces of about 3.3 times the gravity would result.\r\n\r\nLarger spherules yield smaller values. Bredichin’s second and third\r\nclasses would thus be well adapted to meet the requirements which the\r\nradiation pressure demands.\r\n\r\nIt is more difficult to explain how such great forces of repulsion\r\nas those of the first group of Bredichin or of the peculiar comets\r\nof Swift and of Roerdam can occur. When a particle or drop of some\r\nhydrocarbon is exposed to powerful radiation, it may finally become\r\nso intensely heated that it will be carbonized. It will yield a\r\nspongy coal, because gases (chiefly hydrogen) will escape during the\r\ncarbonization, and the particles of coal will resemble the little\r\ngrains of coal-dust which fall from the smokestacks of our steamboats,\r\nand which afterwards float on the surface of the water. It is quite\r\nconceivable that such spherules of coal (consisting probably of\r\nso-called marguerites, felted or pearly structures resembling chains\r\nof bacilli) may have a specific gravity of 0.1, if we make allowance\r\nfor the gases they include (compare page 106.) A light-absorbing drop\r\nof this density of 0.1 might, in the most favorable case, experience\r\na repulsion forty times as strong as the gravitation of the sun. In\r\nthis manner we can picture to ourselves the possibility of the greatest\r\nobserved forces of repulsion.\r\n\r\nThe spectra of comets confirm in every respect the conclusions to which\r\nthe theory of the radiation pressure leads up. They display a faint,\r\ncontinuous spectrum which is probably due to sunlight reflected by\r\nthe small particles. Besides this, we observe, as already mentioned,\r\na spectrum of gaseous hydrocarbons and cyanogen. These band spectra\r\nare due to electric discharges; for they are observed in comets whose\r\ndistance from the sun is so great that they cannot appear luminous\r\nowing to their own high temperatures. In the tail of Swift’s comet\r\nbanded spectra have been observed in portions which were about five\r\nmillion kilometres from the nucleus. The electric discharges must\r\nchiefly be emitted from the outer parts of the tails, where, according\r\nto the laws of static electricity, the electric forces would be\r\nstrongest. For this reason the larger tails of comets look as if they\r\nwere enveloped in cloaks of light of a more intense luminosity.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 36.—Imitation of comets’ tails. Experiment\r\n    by Nichols and Hull. The light of an arc-lamp is concentrated\r\n    by a lens upon the stream of finely powdered particles]\r\n\r\nWhen a comet comes nearer to the sun, other less volatile bodies also\r\nbegin to evaporate. We then find the lines of sodium and, when the\r\ncomet comes very close to the sun, also the lines of iron in its\r\nspectrum. These lines are evidently produced by substances which have\r\nbeen evaporated from the nucleus of the comet. Like the meteorites\r\nfalling upon our earth, the nucleus will consist essentially of\r\nsilicates, and particularly of the silicate of sodium, and, further, of\r\niron.\r\n\r\nWe can easily imagine how the tails of comets change in appearance.\r\nWhen a comet draws near to the sun, we observe that matter is ejected\r\nfrom that part of the nucleus which is turned towards the sun. The\r\ncase is analogous to the formation of clouds in the terrestrial\r\natmosphere on a hot summer day. The clouds are provided with a kind of\r\nhood which envelops like a thin, semi-spherical veil that side of the\r\nnucleus which turns to the sun. Sometimes we observe two or more hoods\r\ncorresponding to the different layers of clouds in the terrestrial\r\natmosphere. From the farther side of the hood matter streams away\r\nfrom the sun. The tails of comets are usually more highly developed\r\nwhen they approach the sun than when they recede from it. That may\r\nbe, as has been assumed for a long time, because a large part of the\r\nhydrocarbons will become exhausted while the comet passes the sun. We\r\nhave also noticed that the so-called periodical comets, which return to\r\nthe sun at regular intervals, showed at every reappearance a fainter\r\ndevelopment of the tail. Comets, further, shine at their greatest\r\nbrilliancy in periods of strong solar-spot activity. We may, therefore,\r\nassume that in those periods the surroundings of the sun are charged\r\nto a relatively high degree with the fine dust which can serve as a\r\ncondensation nucleus for the matter of the comets’ tails. It is also\r\nprobable that in such periods the ionizing radiation of the sun is\r\nmore pronounced than usual, owing to the simultaneous predominance of\r\nfaculæ.\r\n\r\nNichols and Hull have attempted to imitate tails of comets. They\r\nheated the spores of the fungus _Lycoperdon bovista_, which are almost\r\nspherical and of a diameter of about 0.002 mm., up to a red glow, and\r\nthey thus produced little spongy balls of carbon of an average density\r\nof 0.1. These they mixed with emery-powder and introduced them into\r\na glass vessel resembling an hour-glass (Fig. 36) from which the air\r\nhad previously been exhausted as far as possible. They then caused\r\nthe powdered mass to fall in a fine stream into the lower part of the\r\nvessel while exposing it at the same time to the concentrated light of\r\nan arc-lamp. The emery particles fell perpendicularly to the bottom,\r\nwhile the little balls of carbon were driven aside by the radiation\r\npressure of the light.\r\n\r\nWe also meet with the effects of the radiation pressure in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood of the sun. The rectilinear extension of the\r\ncorona streamers to a distance which has been known to exceed six times\r\nthe solar diameter (about eight million km.) indicates that repelling\r\nforces from the sun are acting upon the fine dust. Astronomers have\r\nalso compared the corona of the sun with the tails of comets, and\r\nDonitsch would class it with Bredichin’s comets’ tails of the second\r\nclass. It is possible to calculate the mass of the corona from its\r\nradiation of heat and light. The heat radiated has been measured by\r\nAbbot. At a distance of 30,000 km. from the photosphere, the corona\r\nradiated only as little heat as a body at -55° Cent. The reason is\r\nthat the corona in these parts consists of an extremely attenuated\r\nmist whose actual temperature can be estimated by Stefan’s law at\r\n4300° Cent. The corona must, therefore, be so attenuated that it\r\nwould only cover a 190,000th part of the sky behind it. We arrive at\r\nthe same result when we calculate the amount of light radiated by\r\nthe corona; this radiation is of the order of that of the full moon,\r\nbeing sometimes smaller, sometimes greater, up to twice as great. The\r\nconsiderations we have been offering apply to the most intense part of\r\nthe corona, the so-called inner corona. According to Turner, its light\r\nintensity outward diminishes in the inverse ratio of the sixth power\r\nof its distance from the centre of the sun. At the distance of a solar\r\nradius (690,000 km.) the light intensity would therefore be only 1.6\r\nper cent. of the intensity near the surface of the sun.\r\n\r\nLet us assume that the matter of the corona consists of particles of\r\njust such a size that the radiation pressure would balance their weight\r\n(other particles would be expelled from the inner corona); then we find\r\nthat the weight of the whole corona of the sun would not exceed twelve\r\nmillion metric tons. That is not more than the weight of four hundred\r\nof our large ocean steamships (_e.g._, the _Oceanic_), and only about\r\nas much as the quantity of coal burned on the earth within one week.\r\n\r\nThat the mass of the corona must be extremely rarefied has already\r\nbeen concluded, from the fact that comets have wandered through the\r\ncorona without being visibly arrested in their motion. In 1843 a\r\ncomet passed the sun’s surface at a distance of only one-quarter\r\nthe sun’s radius without being disturbed in its progress. Moulton\r\ncalculated that the great comet of 1881, which approached the sun\r\nwithin one-half its radius, did not encounter a resistance of more than\r\none-fifty-thousandth of its mass, and that the nucleus of the comet\r\nwas at least five million times denser than the matter of the corona.\r\nNewcomb has possibly expressed the degree of attenuation of the corona\r\nin a somewhat exaggerated way when he said that it contains perhaps one\r\ngrain of dust per cubic kilometre (a cube whose side has a length of\r\nthree-fifths of a mile).\r\n\r\nHowever small the quantity of matter in the corona may be, and however\r\nunimportant a fraction of this mass may pass into the coronal rays, it\r\nis yet certain that there is a constant loss of finely divided matter\r\nfrom the sun. The loss, however, is not greater than the supply of\r\nmatter (compare below)—namely, about 300 thousand millions of tons in\r\na year—so that during one billion years not even one-six-thousandth of\r\nthe solar mass (2 × 10^{27} tons) will be scattered into space. This\r\nnumber is very unreliable, however. We know that many meteorites fall\r\nupon the earth, partly as compact stones, partly as the finest dust of\r\nshooting-stars which flash up in the terrestrial atmosphere rapidly to\r\nbe extinguished. These masses may be estimated at about 20,000 tons\r\nper year. According to this estimate, the rain of meteorites which\r\nfalls upon the sun may amount to 300 thousand millions of tons in a\r\nyear. All the suns have emitted matter into space for infinite ages,\r\nand it seems, therefore, a natural inference that many suns would no\r\nlonger be in existence if there had not been a supply of matter to\r\nmake up for this loss. The cold suns undergo relatively small losses,\r\nbut receive just as large inflows of matter as the warm suns. As, now,\r\nour sun belongs to the colder type of stars, it is probable that the\r\nloss of matter from the sun has for this reason been overestimated by\r\nbeing presumed to be as great as the accession. The presence of dark\r\ncelestial bodies may compensate for this overestimation.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 37.—Granular chondrum from the meteorite of\r\n    Sexes.\r\n    Enlargement 1: 70. After S. Tschermak]\r\n\r\nWhence do the meteorites come? If they were not constantly being\r\ncreated, their number should have diminished in the course of ages;\r\nfor they are gradually being caught up by the larger celestial bodies.\r\nIt is not at all improbable that they arise from the accrescence of\r\nsmall particles which the radiation pressure has been driving out\r\nof the sun. The chondri, which are so characteristic of meteorites,\r\ndisplay a structure as if they had grown together out of a multitude\r\nof extremely fine grains (Fig. 37). Nordenskiöld says: “Most meteoric\r\niron consists of an extremely delicate texture of various alloys of\r\nmetals. This mass of meteoric iron is often so porous that it oxidizes\r\non exposure to the air like spongy iron. The Pallas iron, when cut\r\nthrough with a saw, shows this property, which is so distressing for\r\nthe collector. The iron of Cranbourne, of Toluca, and others—in fact,\r\nalmost all the meteorites with a few exceptions—display the same\r\ntexture. It all indicates that these cosmical masses of iron were built\r\nup in the universe by particle being piled upon particle, of iron,\r\nnickel, phosphorus, etc., analogous to the manner in which one atom\r\nof a metal coalesces with another atom when the metal is galvanically\r\ndeposited from a solution. Most of the stony meteorites present a\r\nsimilar appearance. Apart from the crust of slag on the surface, the\r\nstone is often so porous and so loose that it might be used as a\r\nfiltering material, and it may easily be crumbled between the fingers.”\r\nWhen the electrically charged grains of dust coalesce, their small\r\nelectrical potential (of about 0.02 volt) may increase considerably.\r\nUnder the influence of ultra-violet light these masses of meteorites\r\nare discharged when they approach the sun, as Lenard has shown. Their\r\nnegative charge then escapes in the shape of so-called electrons.\r\n\r\nSince, now, the sun loses through the rays of the corona large\r\nmultitudes of particles, and these particles probably carry, according\r\nto Wilson, negative electricity with them, the positive charge must\r\nremain behind in the stratum from which the coronal rays were emitted,\r\nand also on the sun itself. If this charge were sufficiently powerful,\r\nit would prevent the negatively charged particles in the corona from\r\nescaping from the sun, and all the phenomena which we have ascribed\r\nto the radiation pressure would cease. By the aid of the tenets of\r\nthe modern theory of electrons, I have calculated the maximum charge\r\nthat the sun could bear, if it is not to stop these phenomena. The\r\ncharge would amount to two hundred thousand millions of coulombs—not\r\nby any means too large a quantity of electricity, as it would only be\r\nsufficient to decompose twenty-four tons of water.\r\n\r\nBy means of this positive charge the sun exerts a vast attractive\r\npower upon all negatively charged particles which come near it. We\r\nhave already remarked that the grains of sun-dust which have united to\r\nform meteorites lose under the influence of ultra-violet light their\r\ncharge in the shape of negative electrons, extremely minute particles,\r\nof which perhaps one thousand weigh as much as one atom of hydrogen\r\n(1 gramme of hydrogen contains about 10^{24} atoms, corresponding to\r\n10^{27} electrons). These electrons wander about in space. When they\r\napproach a positively charged celestial body they are attracted by it\r\nwith great force. If the electrons were moving with a velocity of 300\r\nkm. per second, as in Lenard’s experiment, and if the sun were charged\r\nto one-tenth the maximum amount just calculated, it would be able to\r\ndraw up all the electrons whose rectilinear path (so far as not curved\r\nby the sun’s attraction) would lie at a distance from the sun 125 times\r\nas great as the distance between the sun and its most remote planet,\r\nNeptune, and 3800 times as great as the distance between the sun and\r\nthe earth, which, after all, would only be one-sixtieth of the distance\r\nfrom our nearest fixed-star neighbor. The sun drains, so to speak, its\r\nsurroundings of negative electricity, and this draining effect carries\r\nto the sun, as could easily be proved, a quantity of electricity which\r\nis directly dependent upon the positive charge of the sun. Thus, so\r\nfar as electricity is concerned, ample provision has been made for\r\nmaintaining equilibrium between the income and expenditure of the sun.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen an electrical particle enters into a magnetic field it describes a\r\nspiral about the so-called magnetic lines of force; when at a greater\r\ndistance, the particles appear to move in the direction of the lines\r\nthemselves. The rays of the corona emanating from the solar poles show\r\na distinct curvature like that of the lines of force about a magnet,\r\nand for this reason the sun has been regarded as a big magnet whose\r\nmagnetic poles nearly coincide with the geographical poles. The coronal\r\nrays nearer the equator likewise show this curvature (compare Fig.\r\n30). The repelling force of the radiation pressure there is, however,\r\nat right angles to the lines of force and much stronger than the\r\nmagnetic force, so that the rays of the corona are compelled to form\r\ntwo big streams flowing in the equatorial direction. This is especially\r\nnoticeable at times of sun-spot minima. During the times of sun-spot\r\nmaxima the strength of the radiation pressure of the initial velocity\r\nof the grains of dust seem to predominate so markedly that the magnetic\r\nforce is relatively small.\r\n\r\nThe astronomers tell us that the sun is only a star of small light\r\nintensity compared to the prominent stars which excite our admiration.\r\nThe sun further belongs to a group of relatively cold stars. We may\r\neasily imagine, therefore, that the radiation pressure in the vicinity\r\nof these larger stars will be able to move much larger masses of matter\r\nthan in our solar system. If the different stars had at any time\r\nconsisted of different chemical elements, this difference would have\r\nbeen equalized in the course of ages. The meteorites may be regarded as\r\nsamples of matter collected and despatched from all possible divisions\r\nof space. Now, what bodies do we find in them?\r\n\r\nIn the comets (compare page 104) iron, sodium, carbon, hydrogen,\r\nand nitrogen (as cyanogen) play the most important part. We know,\r\nespecially from the researches of Schiaparelli that meteorites\r\noften represent fragments of comets, and must therefore be related\r\nto them. Thus Biela’s comet, which had a period of 6.6 years, has\r\ndisappeared since 1852—it had divided into two parts in 1844-1845.\r\nThe comet was rediscovered in a belt of meteorites of the same period\r\nwhich approaches the orbit of the earth each year on November 27.\r\nSimilar relations have been observed with regard to several other\r\nswarms of meteorites. We know also that the just-mentioned elements\r\nwhich spectrum analysis has proved to exist in comets are the main\r\nconstituents of the meteorites, which, in addition, contain the metals\r\ncalcium, magnesium, aluminium, nickel, cobalt, and chromium, as well as\r\nthe metalloids oxygen, silicon, sulphur, phosphorus, chlorine, arsenic,\r\nargon, and helium. Their composition strongly recalls the volcanic\r\nproducts of so-called basic nature—that is to say, those which contain\r\nrelatively large proportions of metallic oxides, and which have been\r\nthought for good reasons to hail from the deeper strata of the interior\r\nof the earth. Lockyer heated meteoric stones in the electric arc to\r\nincandescence and found their spectra to be very similar to the solar\r\nspectrum.\r\n\r\nWe therefore draw the conclusion that these messengers from other\r\nsolar systems which bring us samples of their chemical elements are\r\nclosely related to our sun and to the interior of our earth. That\r\nother stars and comets are essentially composed of the same elements\r\nas our sun and earth, spectrum analysis had already intimated to us.\r\nBut various metalloids, like chlorine, bromine, sulphur, phosphorus,\r\nand arsenic, which are of importance for the composition of the earth,\r\nhave so far not been traced in the spectra of the celestial bodies,\r\nnor in that of the sun. We find them in meteorites, however, and there\r\nis not the slightest doubt that we must likewise count them among the\r\nessential constituents of the sun and other celestial bodies. It is\r\nwith difficulty, however, that the metalloids can be made to exhibit\r\ntheir spectra, and this is manifestly the reason why spectrum analysis\r\nhas not yet succeeded in establishing their presence in the heavens. As\r\nregards the recently discovered so-called noble gases helium, argon,\r\nneon, krypton, and xenon, their presence in the chromosphere has been\r\ndiscovered on spectrograms taken during eclipses of the sun (Stassano).\r\nAccording to Mitchell, however, these statements would appear to be\r\nsomewhat uncertain as to krypton and xenon.\r\n\r\nThe small particles of dust which the radiation pressure drives out\r\ninto space to all possible distances from the sun and the stars may hit\r\nagainst one another and may accumulate to larger or smaller aggregates\r\nin the shape of cosmical dust or meteorites. These aggregates\r\nwill partly fall upon other stars, planets, comets, or moons, and\r\npartly—and this in very great multitudes—they will float about in\r\nspace. There they may, together with the larger dark celestial bodies,\r\nform a kind of haze, which partly hides from us the light of distant\r\ncelestial bodies. Hence we do not see the whole sky covered with\r\nluminous stars, which would be the case if, as we may surmise, the\r\nstars were uniformly distributed all through the infinite space of the\r\nuniverse, and if there were no obstacle to their emission of light. If\r\nthere were no other celestial bodies of very low temperature and very\r\nlarge dimensions which absorbed the heat of the bright suns, the dark\r\ncelestial bodies, the meteorites, and the dark cosmical dust would soon\r\nbe so strongly heated by solar radiation that they would themselves\r\nturn incandescent, and the whole dome of the sky would appear to us\r\nlike one glowing vault whose hot radiation down to the earth would soon\r\nburn every living thing.\r\n\r\nThese other cold celestial bodies which absorb the solar rays\r\nwithout themselves becoming hot are known as nebulæ. More recent\r\nresearches make us believe that these peculiar celestial bodies occur\r\nnearly everywhere in the sky. The wonderful mechanism which enables\r\nthem to absorb heat without raising their own temperature will be\r\nexplained later (in Chapter VII.). As these cold nebulæ occupy vast\r\nportions of space, most of the cosmical dust must finally, in its\r\nwanderings through infinite space, stray into them. This dust will\r\nthere meet masses of gases which stop the penetration of the small\r\ncorpuscles. As the dust is electrically charged (particularly with\r\nnegative electricity), these charges will also be accumulated in the\r\nouter layers of the nebulæ. This will proceed until the electrical\r\ntension becomes so strong that discharges are started by the ejection\r\nof electrons. The surrounding gases will therefore be rendered\r\nluminescent, although their temperature may not much (perhaps by 50°)\r\nexceed absolute zero, -273° Cent., and in this way we are enabled to\r\nobserve these nebulæ. Most of the particles will be stopped before\r\nthey have had time to penetrate very deeply into a nebula, and it\r\nwill therefore principally be the outer portions of the nebulæ which\r\nsend their light to us. That would conform to Herschel’s description\r\nof planetary nebulæ, which display no greater luminosity in their\r\ncentres, but which shine as if they formed hollow spherical shells of\r\nnebulous matter. It is very easy to demonstrate that only substances,\r\nsuch as helium and hydrogen, which are most difficult to condense,\r\ncan at this low temperature exist in gaseous form to any noticeable\r\ndegree. The nebulæ, therefore, shine almost exclusively in the light of\r\nthese gases. There occurs in the nebulæ, in addition to these gases, a\r\nmysterious substance, nebulium, whose peculiar spectrum has not been\r\nfound on the earth nor in the light of stars. Formerly the character\r\nof the nebular spectrum was explained by the assumption either that no\r\nother bodies occurred in nebulæ than the substances mentioned, or that\r\nall the other elements in them were decomposed into hydrogen—helium\r\nwas not known then. The simple explanation is that only the gases of\r\nthe outer layer of the nebulæ are luminous. How their interiors are\r\nconstituted, we do not know.\r\n\r\nIt has been objected to the view just expressed that the whole sky\r\nshould glow in a nebulous light, and that even the outer atmosphere of\r\nthe earth should display such a glow. But hydrogen and helium occur\r\nonly very sparely in the terrestrial atmosphere. We find, however,\r\nanother light, the so-called auroral line, which may possibly be due to\r\nkrypton in our atmosphere. Whichever way we turn the spectroscope on a\r\nvery clear night, especially in the tropics, we observe this peculiar\r\ngreen line. It was formerly considered to be characteristic of the\r\nZodiacal Light, but on a closer examination it has been traced all over\r\nthe sky, even where the Zodiacal Light could not be observed. One of\r\nthe objections to our view is therefore unjustified.\r\n\r\nAs regards the other objection, we have to remark that any light\r\nemission must exceed a certain minimum intensity to become visible.\r\nThere may be nebulæ, and they probably constitute the majority, which\r\nwe cannot observe because the number of electrically charged particles\r\nrushing into them is far too insignificant. A confirmation of this\r\nview was furnished by the flashing-up of the new star in Perseus on\r\nFebruary 21 and 22, 1901. This star ejected two different kinds of\r\nparticles, of which the one kind travelled with nearly double the\r\nvelocity of the other. The accumulations of dust formed two spherical\r\nshells around the new star, corresponding in every respect to the two\r\nkinds of comets’ tails of Bredichin’s first and second classes, which\r\nwe have sometimes observed together in the same comet (Fig. 35). When\r\nthese dust particles, on their road, hit against nebular masses, the\r\nlatter became luminescent, and we thereby obtained knowledge of the\r\npresence of large stellar nebulæ of whose existence we previously\r\nhad not the faintest suspicion. Conditions, no doubt, are similar\r\nin other parts of the heavens where “we have not so far discovered\r\nany nebulæ—we believe, because of the small number of these charged\r\nparticles straying about in those parts. On the same grounds we may\r\nexplain the variability of certain nebulæ which formerly appeared quite\r\nenigmatical.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\n  THE SOLAR DUST IN THE ATMOSPHERE—POLAR LIGHTS AND THE VARIATIONS OF\r\n                         TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have so far dwelt on the effects which the particles expelled\r\nfrom the sun and the stars exert on distant celestial bodies. It may\r\nbe asked whether this dust does not act upon our own earth. We have\r\nalready recognized the peculiar luminescence which on clear nights is\r\ndiffused over the sky as a consequence of electrical discharges of this\r\nstraying dust. This leads to the question whether the magnificent polar\r\nlights, which according to modern views are also caused by electric\r\ndischarges in the higher strata of the atmosphere, are not produced\r\nby dust which the sun sends to us. It will, indeed, be seen that we\r\ncan in this way explain quite a number of the peculiarities of these\r\nmysterious phenomena which have always excited man’s imagination.\r\n\r\nWe know that meteorites and shooting-stars are rendered incandescent\r\nby the resistance which they encounter in the air at an average height\r\nof 120 km. (75 miles), sometimes of 150 and 200 km. In isolated cases\r\nmeteorites are supposed to have become visible even at still greater\r\naltitudes. It would result that there must be appreciable quantities of\r\nair still at relatively high elevation, and that the atmosphere cannot\r\nbe imperceptible at an altitude of less than 100 km., as was formerly\r\nassumed. Bodies smaller than the meteorites as well as the solar dust\r\nwe have spoken of—which, owing to their minuteness and to the strong\r\ncooling by heat radiation and conduction that they undergo in passing\r\nthrough the atmosphere, could never attain incandescence—would be\r\nstopped at greater heights. We will assume that they are arrested at a\r\nmean height of about 400 km. (250 miles).\r\n\r\nThe masses of dust which are expelled by the sun are partly uncharged,\r\npartly charged with positive or negative electricity. Only the latter\r\ncan be connected with the polar lights; the former would remain dark\r\nand slowly sink through our atmosphere to the surface of the earth.\r\nThey form the so-called cosmical dust, of whose great importance\r\nNordenskiöld was so firmly convinced. He estimated that the yearly\r\nincrease in the weight of the earth by the addition of the meteorites\r\nwas at least ten million tons, or five hundred times more than we\r\nstated above (page 108). Like Lockyer and, in more recent days,\r\nChamberlin, he believed that the planets were largely built up of\r\nmeteorites.\r\n\r\nThe dust reaching the earth from the sun would not, were it not\r\nelectrically charged, amount to more than 200 tons in a year. Although\r\nthis figure may be far too low, yet the supply of matter by these means\r\nis certainly very small in comparison with the 20,000 tons which the\r\nearth receives in the shape of meteorites and shooting-stars. But owing\r\nto its extremely minute distribution, the effect of this dust is very\r\nimportant, and it may constitute a much greater portion of the finely\r\ndistributed cosmical dust in the highest strata of the atmosphere than\r\nthe dust introduced by falling meteorites and shooting-stars.\r\n\r\nThat these particles exert a noticeable influence upon terrestrial\r\nconditions, in spite of their relatively insignificant mass, is due to\r\ntwo causes. They are extremely minute and therefore remain suspended\r\nin our atmosphere for long periods (for more than a year in the case of\r\nthe Krakatoa dust), and they are electrically charged.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand their action upon the earth, we will examine how\r\nthe terrestrial conditions depend upon the position of the earth with\r\nregard to the various active portions of the sun, and upon the change\r\nof the sun itself in regard to its emission of dust particles. For this\r\nexamination we have to avail ourselves of extensive statistical data;\r\nfor only a long series of observations can give us a clear conception\r\nof the action of solar dust.\r\n\r\nThese particles withdraw from the sun gases which they were able\r\nto condense on their surface, and which had originally been in the\r\nchromosphere and in the corona of the sun. The most important among\r\nthese gases is hydrogen; next to it come helium and the other noble\r\ngases which Ramsay has discovered in the atmosphere, in which they\r\noccur in very small quantities. As regards hydrogen, Liveing and\r\n(after him) Mitchell have maintained that it is not produced in the\r\nterrestrial atmosphere. Occasionally it is certainly found in volcanic\r\ngases. Thus hydrogen escapes, for instance, from the crater of Kilauea,\r\non Hawaii, but it is burned at once in the atmosphere. If hydrogen were\r\npresent in the atmosphere, it would gradually combine with the oxygen\r\nto water vapor; and we have to assume, therefore, that the hydrogen\r\nmust be introduced into our atmosphere from another source—namely,\r\nfrom the sun. Mitchell finds in this view a strong support for the\r\nopinion that solar dust is always trickling down through our atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of solar dust which reaches our atmosphere will naturally\r\nvary in proportion with the eruptive activity of the sun. The quantity\r\nof dust in the higher strata influences the color of the light of the\r\nsun. After the eruption of the volcano Rakata on Krakatoa, in 1883,\r\nand again, though to a lesser degree, after the eruption of Mont Pelée\r\non Martinique, red sunsets and sunrises were observed all over the\r\nglobe. At the same time, another phenomenon was noticed which could be\r\nestimated quantitatively. The light of the sky is polarized with the\r\nexception of the light coming from a few particular spots. Of these\r\nspots, one called Arago’s Point is situated a little above the antipode\r\nof the sun, and another, Babinet’s Point, is situated above the sun.\r\nIf we determine the elevation of these points above the horizon at\r\nsunset, we find in accordance with the theoretical deduction that this\r\nelevation is greater when the higher strata of the atmosphere are\r\ncharged with dust (as after the eruption of Rakata) than under normal\r\nconditions. Busch, a German scientist, analyzed the mean elevation\r\nof these points (stated in degrees of arc) at sunset, and found the\r\nfollowing peculiar numbers:\r\n\r\n                │1886 │ ’87 │ ’88 │ ’89 │ ’90  │\r\n Arago’s Point  │20.1 │19.7 │18.4 │17.8 │=17.7=│\r\n Babinet’s Point│23.9 │21.9 │17.9 │56.8 │=15.4=│\r\n Sun-spot Number│21.1 │19.1 │ 6.7 │=6.1=│ 6.5  │\r\n\r\n                │ ’91 │ ’92 │ ’93  │  ’94 │ ’95 │Mean\r\n Arago’s Point  │20.6 │19.6 │ 20.2 │=20.7=│18.8 │19.4\r\n Babinet’s Point│23.3 │21.5 │=24.2=│ 23.3 │19.0 │20.7\r\n Sun-spot Number│35.6 │73.8 │=84.9=│ 78.0 │63.9 │40.0\r\n\r\nThere is a distinct parallelism in these series of figures. Almost\r\nsimultaneously with the sun-spot maximum the height of the two\r\nso-called neutral points above the horizon attains its maximum at\r\nsunset, and the same applies to the minimum. That the phenomena in the\r\natmosphere take place a little later than the phenomena on the sun\r\nwhich caused them is perhaps only natural.\r\n\r\nWhen the air is rich in dust, or when it is strongly ionized by kathode\r\nrays, conditions are favorable for the formation of clouds. This can\r\nbe observed, for instance, with auroral lights. They regularly give\r\nrise to a characteristic cloud formation, so much so that Adam Paulsen\r\nwas able to recognize polar lights by the aid of these clouds in\r\nfull daylight. Klein has compiled a table on the connection between\r\nthe frequency of the higher clouds, the so-called cirrus clouds, at\r\nCologne, and the number of sun-spots during the period 1850-1900. He\r\ndemonstrates that during this half-century, which comprises more than\r\nfour sun-spot periods, the sun-spot maxima fell in the years in which\r\nthe greatest number of cirrus clouds had been observed. The minima of\r\nthe two phenomena are likewise in agreement.\r\n\r\nA similarly intensified formation of clouds seems also to occur on\r\nJupiter when sun-spots are frequent. Vogel states that Jupiter at such\r\ntimes shines with a whiter light, while at sun-spot minima it appears\r\nof a deeper red. The deeper we are able to peep into the atmosphere of\r\nJupiter, the more reddish it appears. During periods of strong solar\r\nactivity the higher portions of Jupiter’s atmosphere therefore appear\r\nto be crowded with clouds.\r\n\r\nThe discharge of the charged solar dust in our atmosphere calls forth\r\nthe polar lights.\r\n\r\nThe polar lights occur, as the name indicates, most frequently in\r\nthe districts about the poles of the earth. They are, however, not\r\nactually more frequent the nearer we come to the poles; but they\r\nattain a maximum of frequency in circles which enclose the magnetic\r\nand the geographical poles. The northern maximum belt passes, via\r\nCape Tscheljuskin, north of Novaja Semlja, along the northwestern\r\ncoast of Norway, a few degrees to the south of Iceland and Greenland,\r\nright across Hudson Bay and over the northwestern extension of Alaska.\r\nWhen we go to the south of this belt, the auroras, or boreal lights,\r\ndiminish markedly. They are four times less frequent in Edinburgh, and\r\nfifteen times less frequent in London or New York, than in the Orkney\r\nIslands or Labrador.\r\n\r\nPaulsen divides the auroras into two classes, which behave quite\r\ndifferently in several respects. The great difficulties which the\r\nsolution of the problems of polar lights has so far offered seem to a\r\nlarge extent to be due to the fact that all polar lights were treated\r\nas being of the same kind.\r\n\r\nThe polar lights of the first class do not display any streamers. They\r\ncover a large portion of the sky in a horizontal direction. They are\r\nvery quiet, and their light is strikingly constant. As a rule, they\r\ndrift slowly towards the zenith, and they do not give rise to any\r\nmagnetic disturbances.\r\n\r\nThese polar lights generally have the shape of an arch whose apex is\r\nsituated in the direction of the magnetic meridian (Fig. 38). Sometimes\r\nseveral arches are grouped one above another.\r\n\r\nNordenskiöld observed these arches quite regularly during the polar\r\nnight when he was wintering near Pitlekaj, in the neighborhood\r\nof Bering Sound. Adam Paulsen has often seen them on Iceland and\r\nGreenland, which are situated within the maximum belt spoken of, where\r\nnorthern lights are very common. Occasionally auroras are also seen\r\nfarther from the poles, as circular arches of a milky white, which may\r\nbe quite high in the heavens.\r\n\r\nSometimes we perceive in the arctic regions that large areas of the\r\nheavens are covered by a diffused light which might best be compared\r\nto a luminous, transparent cloud; the darker portions in it probably\r\nappear dark by contrast. This phenomenon was frequently observed\r\nduring the Swedish expedition of 1882-1883, near Cape Thordsen.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 38.—Arch-shaped auroræ borealis, observed\r\n    by Nordenskiöld during the wintering of the _Vega_ in Bering\r\n    Strait, 1879]\r\n\r\nMasses of light at so low a level that the rocks behind them are\r\nobscured have frequently been observed to float in the air, especially\r\nin the arctic districts. Thus Lemström saw an aurora on the island\r\nof Spitzbergen in front of a wall of rock only 300 m. (1000 ft.) in\r\nheight. In northern Finland he observed the auroral line in the light\r\nof the air in front of a black cloth only a few metres distant. Adam\r\nPaulsen counts these phenomena also as polar lights of the first class,\r\nand he regards them as phosphorescent clouds which have been carried\r\ndown by convection currents to an unusually low level of our atmosphere.\r\n\r\nPolar lights of the second class are distinguished by the\r\ncharacteristic auroral rays or streamers. Sometimes these streamers are\r\nquite separated from one another (see Fig. 39); as a rule they melt\r\ninto one another, especially below, so as to form draperies which are\r\nso easily moved and unsteady that they appear to flutter in the wind\r\n(Fig. 41.) The streamers run very approximately in the direction of the\r\ninclination (magnetic dip) needle, and when they are fully developed\r\naround the celestial dome their point of convergence is distinctly\r\ndiscernible in the so-called corona (Fig. 40). When the light is at its\r\ngreatest intensity the aurora is traversed by numerous waves of light.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 39.—Aurora borealis, with radial streamers]\r\n\r\nThe draperies are very thin. Paulsen watched them sometimes drifting\r\nover his head in Greenland. The draperies then appeared foreshortened,\r\nin the shape of striæ or ribbons of light in convolutions. These polar\r\nlights influence the magnetic needle. When they pass the zenith their\r\ninfluence changes sign, so that the deviation of the magnetic needle\r\nchanges from east to west when the ribbon is moving from north to\r\nsouth. Paulsen therefore concluded that negative electricity (kathode\r\nrays) was moving downward in these rays. These polar lights correspond\r\nto violent displacements of negative electricity, while polar lights\r\nof the first class appear to consist of a phosphorescent matter which\r\nis not in strong agitation. The streamers may penetrate down into\r\nrather low atmospheric strata, at least in districts which are near the\r\nmaximum belt of the northern lights. Thus Parry observed at Port Bowen\r\nan auroral streamer in front of a cliff only 214 m. (700 ft.) in height.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 40.—Aurora with corona, observed by\r\n    Gyllenskiöld on Spitzbergen, 1883]\r\n\r\nPolar lights of the first order may pass into those of the second\r\norder, and _vice versa_. We frequently see rays suddenly flash out from\r\nthe arch of the aurora, mostly downward, but, when the display is very\r\nintense, also upward. On the other hand, the violent agitation of a\r\n“drapery light” may cease, and may give way to a diffused, steady glow\r\nin the sky. The polar light of the first class is chiefly observed in\r\nthe arctic regions. To it corresponds, in districts farther removed\r\nfrom the pole, the diffused light which appears to be spread uniformly\r\nover the heavens and which gives the auroral line.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 41.—Polar-light draperies, observed in\r\n    Finnmarken, northern Norway]\r\n\r\nThe usually observed polar lights (speaking not only of those seen on\r\narctic expeditions) belong to the second class, which comprises also\r\nall those included in the subjoined statistics, with the exception\r\nof the auroral displays reported from Iceland and Greenland. While\r\nthe streamer lights distinctly conform to the 11.1 years’ period, and\r\nbecome more frequent at times of sun-spot maxima, this is not the case,\r\naccording to Tromholt, with the auroras of Iceland and Greenland. Their\r\nfrequency, on the contrary, seems to be rather independent of the\r\nsun-spot frequency. Not rarely auroral maxima corresponding to sun-spot\r\nmaxima are subdivided into two by a secondary minimum. This phenomenon\r\nis most evident in the polar regions, but it can also be traced in the\r\nstatistics from Scandinavia and from other countries.\r\n\r\nBetter to understand the nature of auroras, we will consider the sun’s\r\ncorona during the time of a minimum year, taking as an example the year\r\n1900 (compare Fig. 30). The rays of the corona in the neighborhood\r\nof the poles of the sun are laterally deflected by the action of the\r\nmagnetic lines of force of the sun. The small, negatively charged\r\nparticles have evidently only a low velocity, so that they move quite\r\nclose to the lines of force in the neighborhood of the solar poles\r\nand are concentrated near the equator. There the lines of force are\r\nless crowded—that is to say, the magnetic forces are weaker—and the\r\nsolar dust can therefore be ejected by the radiation pressure and will\r\naccumulate to a large disk expanding in the equatorial plane. To us\r\nthis disk appears like two large streams of rays which project in the\r\ndirection of the solar equator. Part of this solar dust will come near\r\nthe earth and be deflected by the magnetic lines of force of the earth;\r\nit will hence be divided into two streams which are directed towards\r\nthe two terrestrial magnetic poles. These poles are situated below the\r\nearth’s crust, and therefore not all the rays will be concentrated\r\ntowards the apparent position of the magnetic poles upon the surface of\r\nthe earth. It is to be expected that the negatively charged particles\r\ncoming from the sun will chiefly drift towards that district which is\r\nsituated somewhat to the south of the magnetic north pole, when it is\r\nnoon at this pole. When it is midnight at the magnetic pole, most\r\nof the negatively charged particles will be caught by the lines of\r\nforce before they pass the geographical north pole, and the maximum\r\nbelt of the auroras will for this reason surround the magnetic and\r\nthe geographical poles, as has already been pointed out (compare page\r\n122). The negatively charged solar dust will thus be concentrated in\r\ntwo rings above the maximum belts of the polar lights. Where the dust\r\ncollides with molecules of the air, it will produce a phosphorescent\r\nglow, as if these molecules were hit by the electrically charged\r\nparticles of radium. This phosphorescent glow rises in the shape of a\r\nluminous arch to a height of about 400 km. (250 miles)—according to\r\nPaulsen—and the apex of this arch will in every part seem to lie in\r\nthe direction where the maximum belt is nearest to the station of the\r\nobserver. That will fairly coincide with the direction of the magnetic\r\nneedle.\r\n\r\nThe solar corona of a sun-spot maximum year is of a very different\r\nappearance (Fig. 31). The streamers radiate straight from the sun in\r\nalmost all directions; and if there be some privileged directions,\r\nit will be those above the sun-spot belts. The velocity of the solar\r\ndust is evidently so great that the streamers are no longer visibly\r\ndeflected by the magnetic lines of force of the sun. Nor is this\r\ncharged dust influenced to any noticeable degree by the magnetic lines\r\nof force of the earth. It will in the main fall straight down in that\r\npart of the atmosphere in which the radiation is most intense: As\r\nthese “hard” rays of the sun[8] seem to issue from the faculæ of the\r\nsun which are most frequent in maximum sun-spot years, some polar\r\nlights will also be seen in districts which are far removed from the\r\nmaximum belt of the auroras, especially when the number of sun-spots\r\nis large. The opposite relation holds for the “soft” streams of solar\r\ndust which fall near the maximum belt of the polar lights. These\r\nstreams occur most frequently with low sun-spot frequency, as we know\r\nfrom observations of the solar corona. Possibly they are carried\r\nalong by the stream of harder rays in maximum years. The polar lights\r\ncorresponding to these rays therefore attain their maximum with few\r\nsun-spots. Hard and soft dust streams occur, of course, simultaneously;\r\nbut the former predominate in maximum sun-spot years, the latter in\r\nminimum years.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: The designations “hard” and “soft” streams of\r\n    solar dust correspond to the terms used with regard to kathode\r\n    rays. The soft rays have a smaller velocity, and are therefore\r\n    more strongly deflected by external forces, as, for instance,\r\n    magnetic forces.]\r\n\r\nThat the periodicity of the polar lights in regions without the maximum\r\nbelt follows very closely the periodicity of the sun-spots was shown by\r\nFritz as early as 1863. The length of the period varies between 7 and\r\n16 years, the average being 11.1 years. The years of maxima and minima\r\nfor sun-spots and for northern auroras are the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n                             MAXIMUM YEARS\r\n\r\n    Sun-spots       1728  ’39  ’50  ’62  ’70  ’78  ’88  1804  ’16  ’30\r\n                    1837  ’48  ’60  ’71  ’83  ’93  1905\r\n    Northern lights 1730  ’41  ’49  ’61  ’73  ’78  ’88  1805  ’19  ’30\r\n                    1840  ’50  ’62  ’71  ’82  ’93  1905\r\n\r\n\r\n                             MINIMUM YEARS\r\n\r\n    Sun-spots       1734  ’45  ’55  ’67  ’76  ’85  ’98  1811  ’23  ’34\r\n                    1844  ’56  ’67  ’78  ’89  1900\r\n    Northern lights 1735  ’44  ’55  ’66  ’75  ’83  ’99  1811  ’22  ’34\r\n                    1844  ’56  ’66  ’78  ’89  1900\r\n\r\nThere are, in addition, as De Mairan proved in his classical memoir of\r\nthe year 1746, longer periods common to both the number of sun-spots\r\nand the number of auroras. According to Hansky, the length of this\r\nperiod is 72 years; according to Schuster, 33 years. Very pronounced\r\nmaxima occurred at the beginning and the end of the eighteenth century,\r\nthe last in the year 1788; afterwards auroras became very rare in the\r\nyears 1800-1830, just as in the middle of the eighteenth century. In\r\n1850, and particularly in 1871, there were strong maxima; they have\r\nbeen absent since then.\r\n\r\nThe estimates of the heights of the polar lights vary very\r\nconsiderably. The height seems to be the greater, on the whole, the\r\nnearer the point of observation is to the equator, which would well\r\nagree with the slight deflection of the kathode rays towards the\r\nsurface of the earth in regions which are farther removed from the\r\npole. Gyllenskiöld found on Spitzbergen a mean height of 55 km.;\r\nBravais, in northern Norway, 100 to 200 km.; De Mairan, in central\r\nEurope, 900 km.; Galle, again, 300 km. In Greenland, Paulsen observed\r\nnorthern lights at very low levels. In Iceland he fixed the apex of\r\nthe northern arch which may be considered as a point where the charged\r\nparticles from the sun are discharged into the air at about 400 km. Not\r\nmuch reliance can be placed upon the earlier determinations; but the\r\nheights given conform approximately to the order of magnitude which we\r\nmay deduce from the height at which the solar dust will be stopped by\r\nthe terrestrial atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe polar lights possess, further, a pronounced yearly periodicity\r\nwhich is easily explicable by the aid of the solar dust theory. We have\r\nseen that sun-spots are rarely observed near the solar equator, and the\r\nsame applies to solar faculæ. They rapidly increase in frequency with\r\nhigher latitudes of the sun, and their maximum occurs at latitudes of\r\nabout fifteen degrees. The equatorial plane of the sun is inclined by\r\nabout seven degrees towards the plane of the earth’s orbit. The earth\r\nis in the equatorial plane of the sun on December 6th and June 4th,\r\nand most distant from it three months later. We may, therefore, expect\r\nthat the smallest number of solar-dust particles will fall on the earth\r\nwhen the earth is in the equator of the sun—that is, in December and\r\nJune—and the greatest number in March and September. These relations\r\nare somewhat disturbed by the twilight, which interferes with the\r\nobservation of auroras in the bright summer nights of the arctic\r\nregion, while the dark nights of the winter favor the observation\r\nof these phenomena. The distribution of the polar lights over the\r\ndifferent seasons of the year will become clear from the subjoined\r\ntable compiled by Ekholm and myself:\r\n\r\n                                    Iceland and  United   Southern\r\n                  Sweden    Norway   Greenland   States    auroræ\r\n                 (1883-96) (1861-95) (1872-92)  (1871-93) (1856-94)\r\n\r\n    January         1056      =251=     804       1005      =56=\r\n    February        1173       331      734       1455      126\r\n    March          =1312=     =335=     613       1396     =183=\r\n    April            568        90      128      =1724=     148\r\n    May              170         6        1       1270       54\r\n    June             =10=       =0=      =0=     =1061=      40\r\n    July              54         0        0       1233      =35=\r\n    August           191        18       40       1210       75\r\n    September       1055       209      455      =1735=     120\r\n    October        =1114=     =353=     716       1630     =192=\r\n    November        1077       326      811       1240      112\r\n    December        =940=      260     =863=      912        81\r\n     Average number  727       181      430       1322      102\r\n\r\nIn zones where the difference between the lengths of day and night of\r\nthe different seasons is not very great, as in the United States, and\r\nin districts in which the southern light is observed (about latitude\r\n40° S.), the chief minimum falls in winter: on the northern hemisphere,\r\nin December; on the southern hemisphere, in June or July. A less\r\npronounced minimum occurring in the summer. Twice in the course of the\r\nyear the earth passes through the plane of the solar equator. During\r\nthese periods a minimum of solar dust trickles down upon the earth, and\r\nthat period is characterized by a larger number of polar lights which\r\nis distinguished by a higher elevation of the sun above the horizon.\r\nWe may expect this; for most solar dust will fall upon that portion\r\nof the earth over which the sun is highest at noon. The two maxima of\r\nMarch or April and of September or October, when the earth is at its\r\ngreatest distance from the plane of the solar equator, are strongly\r\nmarked in all the series, except in those for the polar districts\r\nIceland and Greenland. There the auroral frequency is solely dependent\r\nupon the intensity of the twilight, so that we find a single maximum in\r\nDecember and the corresponding minimum in June. More recent statistics\r\n(1891-1903) indicate, however, a minimum in December. For the same\r\nreason the summer minimum in countries of high latitudes, like Sweden\r\nand Norway, is very much accentuated.\r\n\r\nSimilar reasons render it difficult for most localities to indicate the\r\ndaily periodicity of the polar lights. Most of the solar dust falls\r\nabout noon; and most polar lights should therefore be counted a few\r\nhours after noon, just as the highest temperature of the day is reached\r\na little after noon. On account of the intense sunlight, however,\r\nthis maximum can only be established in the wintry night of the polar\r\nregions, and even there only when a correction has been made for the\r\ndisturbing effect of the twilight. In this way Gyllenskiöld found a\r\nnorthern-light maximum at 2.40 P.M. for Cape Thordsen, on Spitzbergen,\r\nthe corresponding minimum being at 7.40 A.M. In other localities we\r\ncan only ascertain that the polar lights are more intense and more\r\nfrequent before than after midnight. In central Europe the maximum\r\noccurs at about 9 P.M.; in Sweden and Norway (in latitude 60° N.), half\r\nan hour or an hour later.\r\n\r\nA few other periods, approximately of the length of a month, have\r\nbeen suggested with regard to polar lights. A period lasting 25.93\r\ndays predominates in the southern lights, where the maximum exceeds\r\nthe average by 44 per cent. For the northern lights in Norway the\r\ncorresponding excess percentage is 23; for Sweden, only 11.[9]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: The reason is that in the southern district only\r\n    very few, and chiefly the most intense, auroras are recorded.\r\n    If we observe very assiduously in a large country, and conduct\r\n    the observations at different spots, we shall find polar light\r\n    almost every night. This consideration partly wipes out the\r\n    just-mentioned differences.]\r\n\r\nThe same period of nearly twenty-six days had already been pointed out\r\nfor a long series of other especially magnetic phenomena which, as we\r\nshall see, are very closely connected with auroras, and it had also\r\nbeen found in the frequency of thunder-storms and in the variations of\r\nthe barometer. This periodicity has often been thought to be connected\r\nwith the axial rotation of the sun. The Austrian scientist Hornstein\r\nhas even gone so far as to propose that the length of this period\r\nshould be carefully determined, “because it would give a more accurate\r\nvalue for the rotation of the sun than the direct determinations.”\r\nWe know now that the length of the solar revolution is different for\r\ndifferent solar altitudes, a circumstance with which observations\r\nof sun-spot movements at different latitudes had already made\r\nCarrington and Spörer familiar, but which was not safely established\r\nbefore Dunér’s spectroscopical determination of the movement of the\r\nsolar photosphere. Dunér found the following sidereal revolutions\r\nfor different latitudes of the sun to which the subjoined synodical\r\nrevolution would correspond. (By sidereal revolution of a point on the\r\nsun we understand the time which elapses between the two moments when a\r\ncertain star passes, on two consecutive occasions, through the meridian\r\nplane of the point—that is to say, through a plane laid through the\r\npoles of the sun and the point in question. The synodical revolution\r\nis determined by the passage of the earth through this meridian. On\r\naccount of the proper motion of the earth the synodical period is\r\nlonger than the sidereal period.)\r\n\r\n    Latitude on the sun (degrees)   0    15    30    45    60    75\r\n    Sidereal revolution (days)    25.4  26.4  27.6  30.0  33.9  38.5\r\n    Synodical revolution (days)   27.3  28.5  29.9  32.7  37.4  43.0\r\n\r\nThat the periods of rotation of the solar photosphere, and, in a\r\nsimilar way, the periods of the spots, the faculæ, and the prominences,\r\nshould become so considerably longer with increasing latitudes is one\r\nof the most mysterious problems of the physics of the sun. Something\r\nsimilar applies to the clouds of Jupiter, but the difference in that\r\ncase is much smaller—only about one per cent. The clouds of our\r\natmosphere behave quite differently, a fact which is explained by our\r\natmospheric circulation.[10]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: The very highest strata of our atmosphere (at\r\n    levels of from 20 to 80 km., 15 to 50 miles) may perhaps form\r\n    an exception. The luminous clouds which were observed in the\r\n    years 1883-1892 at Berlin (after the eruption of Krakatoa), and\r\n    which were floating at a very high level, showed a drift with\r\n    regard to the surface of the earth opposite to the drift of the\r\n    cirrus clouds, which are directed eastward.]\r\n\r\nIn our case, of course, the position of the sun with regard to\r\nthe earth—that is to say, the synodical period—can alone be of\r\nimportance. We recognize that the period of 25.93 days does not at all\r\nagree with any period of the solar photosphere. The solar equatorial\r\nzone differs least, and it would be appropriate to reckon with this\r\nperiod, since the earth never moves very far from the plane of the\r\nsolar equator, and returns to that plane, at any rate, twice in the\r\ncourse of a year.\r\n\r\nBut there is another peculiarity. The higher a point is situated\r\nin the atmosphere of the sun, the shorter is its period. Thus the\r\nsynodical period of the faculæ near the equator is on an average 26.06,\r\nthe period of the spots 26.82, of the photosphere 27.3 days. Faculæ\r\nsituated at higher levels revolve still more rapidly, and we are thus\r\ndriven to the conclusion that the period to which we have alluded\r\nagrees with the period of the faculæ situated at higher levels in the\r\nequatorial zone of the sun, and is probably dependent upon them. That\r\nwould conform to our ideas concerning the physics of the sun. For the\r\nfaculæ are produced in the ascending currents of gas and at rather\r\nlower levels than the spherules which are expelled by the radiation\r\npressure. This radiation pressure is strongest just in the neighborhood\r\nof the faculæ.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason the repulsion of the solar dust becomes\r\nparticularly powerful when the faculæ are strongly developed—that is\r\nto say, just in the time of pronounced eruptive activity of the sun\r\nwhich is characterized by many sun-spots.\r\n\r\nWe must thus imagine that the radiation of the sun will be stronger\r\nin times of strong eruptive activity than during the days of low\r\nsun-spot frequencies. Direct observations of the intensity of the solar\r\nradiation which have been made by Saveljeff in Kieff confirm this\r\nassumption. It must be pointed out, however, that another phenomenon\r\ninvestigated by Köppen seems to contradict this conclusion. Köppen\r\nascertained that in our tropics the temperature was by 0.32° Cent.\r\n(nearly 0.6° F.) lower during sun-spot maxima than the average, and\r\nthat five years later, a year before the sun-spot minimum, it reached\r\nits maximum value of 0.41° Cent. (0.7° F.) above the average. A similar\r\npeculiarity can be traced to other zones, but on account of the less\r\nsteady climates it is much less marked there than in the tropics. A\r\nFrench physicist, Nordmann, has fully confirmed the observations of\r\nKöppen. On the other hand, Very, an American astronomer, has found that\r\nthe temperature in very dry (desert) districts of the tropics (near\r\nPort Darwin, 12° 28´ S., and near Alice Springs, 23° 38´ S., both in\r\nAustralia) is higher at sun-spot maxima than at minima; but Very was\r\nin this research guided merely by the records of maximum and minimum\r\nthermometers. From Very’s investigation it would appear that the solar\r\nradiation is really more intense with larger sun-spot numbers.[11]\r\nThis, it must be remarked, is only noticeable in exceedingly dry\r\ndistricts in which there is no cloud formation worth mentioning. In\r\nother districts the cloud formation which accompanies sun-spot maxima\r\ninterferes with the simplicity of the phenomena. The cooling effect of\r\nthe clouds seems in these cases by far to surpass the direct heating\r\neffect of the solar rays, and in this manner Köppen’s conclusion\r\nwould become explicable. If we could observe the temperatures of the\r\natmospheric strata above the clouds, their variation would no doubt be\r\nin the same degree as that in the desert.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 11: According to Memery (_Bull. Soc. Astr._, March 7,\r\n    1906, p. 168) an instantaneous rise of temperature is observed\r\n    immediately when a sun-spot is first seen, and the temperature\r\n    sinks again when the sun-spot disappears.]\r\n\r\nFinally, we have to note another period in the phenomena of the polar\r\nlights—the so-called tropical month, whose length is 27.3 days. The\r\nnature of this period is little understood. It is possibly connected\r\nwith the electric charge of the moon. The peculiarity of this period\r\nis that it acts in an opposite way in the northern and southern\r\nhemispheres. When the moon is above the horizon, it seems to prevent\r\nthe formation of polar lights; but for this case the difficulties of\r\nobservation caused by the moonlight must, of course, be taken into\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 42.—Curve of magnetic declination at\r\n    Kew, near London, on November 15 and 16, 1905. The violent\r\n    disturbance of November 15, 9 P.M., corresponds to the maximum\r\n    intensity of the aurora. Compare the following figure]\r\n\r\nCelsius and Hiorter observed in 1741 that the polar lights exercise an\r\ninfluence on the magnetic needle. From this circumstance we have drawn\r\nthe conclusion that the polar lights are in some way due to electric\r\ndischarges which act upon the magnetic needle. These magnetic effects,\r\nthe disturbances of the otherwise steady position of the magnetic\r\nneedle, are not influenced by the light of the sun and moon, and can\r\ntherefore be studied to greater advantage than auroras. We have\r\nalready pointed out that it is only the aurora of the radial, streamer\r\ntype which exerts this magnetic influence (compare Figs. 42 and 43).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 43.—Curve of horizontal intensity at Kew on\r\n    November 15 and 16, 1905. On November 15 a magnificent aurora\r\n    was observed in Galicia, Germany, France, Norway, England,\r\n    Ireland, and Nova Scotia, with a maximum at 9 P.M. The polar\r\n    light was unusually brilliant as early as 6 P.M.]\r\n\r\nThese magnetic variations show exactly the same periods as the northern\r\nlights and the sun-spots. As regards, first, the long period of 11.1\r\nyears, our observations prove that the so-called magnetic disturbances\r\nof the position of the magnetic needle faithfully reflect the\r\nvariations in the sun-spots. This connection was discovered in 1852 by\r\nSabine in England, by Wolf in Switzerland, and by Gautier in France.\r\nEven the more irregular diurnal variations in the magnetic elements\r\nare subjected to a solar period. The magnetic needle points in our\r\ndistricts with its north end towards the north—not exactly, though,\r\nbeing deflected towards the west. This western deviation or declination\r\nis greatest soon after noon, about one o’clock, and this diurnal change\r\nis greater in summer than in winter, and the fluctuation of the\r\nposition of the magnetic needle greater in daytime than at night-time.\r\nIt is, therefore, manifest that we have to deal with some solar\r\neffect. This becomes still more distinct when we study the change with\r\nreference to the daily variation in the number of sun-spots. In the\r\nsubjoined table the variation in the declination has been compiled for\r\nPrague for the years 1856 to 1889. Only years with maxima and minima of\r\nsun-spots and of magnetic variations have been noticed in this table:\r\n\r\n                      1856  1860  1867   1871  1879  1884  1889\r\n\r\n    Sun-spot number    4.3  95.7   7.3  139.1   3.4  63.7   6.3\r\n\r\n\r\n                    DAILY VARIATIONS IN DECLINATION\r\n\r\n                      1856   1859  1867  1871   1878  1883  1889\r\n\r\n    Observed          5.98  10.36  6.95  11.43  5.65  8.34  5.99\r\n    Calculated        6.08  10.20  6.22  12.15  6.04  8.76  6.17\r\n\r\nWe see that the maxima and minima years of the two phenomena very\r\nnearly coincide. The accord is so evident that we may calculate the\r\ndiurnal variation as proportional to the increase in the number of\r\nsun-spots. This is shown by the two last lines of the table.\r\n\r\nThe yearly variation is again exactly the same as that of polar lights,\r\nas the following table indicates, in which the disturbances of magnetic\r\ndeclination, horizontal intensity, and vertical intensity are compiled\r\nfor Toronto, Canada; for comparison the means of these three magnitudes\r\nare added for Greenwich.

The maximum occurs there about 1 P.M., and is about 1.86 times\r\nas great as the average value for the day. The minimum of 0.48 occurs\r\nat 11 P.M. Between 8 P.M. and 3 A.M. the disturbances are almost as\r\nrare as about 11 o’clock at night.\r\n\r\nThe variation is greatest with that declination which has its maximum\r\nof 3.26 at 12 M., and its minimum of 0.14 at 11 P.M.\r\n\r\nThe period of almost 26 days first investigated by Hornstein has also\r\nbeen refound in the magnetic variations and disturbances by Broun,\r\nLiznár, and C. A. Müller. It must be added, however, that Schuster does\r\nnot consider these data as in any way conclusive.\r\n\r\nThe moon has also a slight influence upon the magnetic needle, as\r\nKreil proved as early as 1841. The effect is in a different sign in\r\nthe northern and southern hemispheres, and may be likened to a tidal\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nThe ultra-violet rays of the sun are strongly absorbed by the\r\natmosphere, and they cause an ionization of the molecules of the air.\r\nThis ionization is, on the whole, more marked at higher altitudes. The\r\nascending air currents carry with them water vapor which is condensed\r\non the ions, particularly on the negative ions. In this way most\r\nclouds become negatively charged; this interesting fact—_i.e._, that\r\nthey are more frequently charged with negative than with positive\r\nelectricity—was first proved by Franklin in his kite experiments.\r\nWhen the rain-drops have fallen, the air above remains positively\r\ncharged; this has been observed during balloon ascensions. The clouds\r\nwhich are formed at high levels are most strongly charged; for this\r\nreason thunder-storms over land occur mostly in the summer-time. The\r\nthunder-storms also show the 26-day period, as Bezold has proved for\r\nsouthern Germany, and Ekholm and myself have shown for Sweden.\r\n\r\nA vast amount of material concerning these questions and magnetic\r\nphenomena in particular has been collected by the various\r\nmeteorological observatories and is awaiting analysis.\r\n\r\nAlthough some observers like Sidgreaves question the correlation of\r\nsun-spots and polar lights or magnetic disturbances, because strong\r\nspots have been seen on the disk of the sun without any magnetic\r\ndisturbances having been noticed, yet the view predominates that the\r\nmagnetic disturbances are caused by sun-spots when the sun-spots cross\r\nthe central meridian of the sun which is opposite the earth. Thus\r\nMaunder observed a magnetic storm and a northern light succeeding the\r\npassage of a large sun-spot through the central solar meridian on the\r\n8th to the 10th of September, 1898. The magnetic effect attained its\r\nmaximum about twenty-one hours after the passage through the meridian.\r\n\r\nSimilarly Riccò established in ten instances, in which exact\r\ndetermination was possible, a time interval of 45.5 hours on an\r\naverage between the meridian passage of a spot and the maximum\r\nmagnetic effect. Riccò also submitted to an analysis the data which\r\nEllis had collected and which Maunder had investigated. He found for\r\nthese instances, on an average, almost exactly the same numbers,\r\nthe time interval being 42.5 hours. That would correspond to a mean\r\nvelocity of the solar dust of from 910 to 980 km. per second. On the\r\nother hand, we have no difficulty at all in calculating the time\r\nwhich a spherule of a diameter of 0.00016 mm. (those particles travel\r\nfastest) and of the specific gravity of water would need in order to\r\nreach the earth, under the influence of solar gravitation and of a\r\nmechanical radiation pressure 2.5 times as large from the outside of\r\nthe sun. The time found, 56.1 hours, corresponds to a mean velocity\r\nof 740 km. per second. In order that the solar dust may move with the\r\nvelocity calculated by Riccò, its specific gravity should be less than\r\n1—_viz._, 0.66 and 0.57. This value looks by no means improbable,\r\nwhen we assume that the spherules consist of hydrocarbons saturated\r\nwith hydrogen, helium, and other noble gases. We should also arrive\r\nat larger velocities for the solar dust, as has already been pointed\r\nout with regard to the tails of comets, when we presume that the\r\nparticles consist of felted marguerites of carbon or silicates, or of\r\niron—materials which we regard as the main constituents of meteorites.\r\n\r\nIt should, perhaps, be mentioned that the most intense spectrum line\r\nof the polar lights has been found to be characteristic of the noble\r\ngas krypton. As this gas is found only in very small quantities in our\r\natmosphere, it does not appear improbable that it has been carried\r\nto us together with the solar dust, and that its spectrum becomes\r\nperceptible during the discharge phenomena. The other spectrum lines\r\nof the polar lights belong to the spectra of nitrogen, argon, and of\r\nthe other noble gases. The volumes of noble gases which are brought\r\ninto our terrestrial atmosphere in this manner would in any case be\r\nexceedingly small.\r\n\r\nThe electrical phenomena of our terrestrial atmosphere indirectly\r\npossess considerable importance for organic life and, consequently,\r\nfor human beings. By the electrical discharges part of the nitrogen is\r\nmade to combine with the oxygen and hydrogen (liberated by the electric\r\ndecomposition of water vapor) of our air, and it thus forms the\r\nammonia compounds, as well as the nitrates and nitrites, which are so\r\nessential to vegetable growth. The ammonia compounds which play a most\r\nimportant part in the temperate zones appear especially to be formed\r\nby the so-called silent discharges which we connect with auroras. The\r\noxygen compounds of nitrogen, on the other hand, seem to be chiefly the\r\nproducts of the violent thunder-storms of the tropics. The rains carry\r\nthese compounds down into the soil, where they fertilize the plants.\r\n\r\nThe supply of nitrogen thus fixed amounts in the course of a year to\r\nabout 1.25 gramme per square metre in Europe, and to almost fourfold\r\nthat figure in the tropics. If we accept three grammes as the average\r\nnumber for the whole firm land of the earth, that would mean 3 tons per\r\nsquare kilometre, and about 400 million tons per year for the whole\r\nfirm land of 136 million square kilometres. A very small portion of\r\nthis fixed nitrogen, possibly one-twentieth, falls on cultivated soil;\r\na larger portion will help to stimulate plant growth in the forests\r\nand on the steppes. We may mention, for comparison, that the nitrogen\r\ncontained in the saltpetre which the mines of Chili yield to us has\r\nrisen from 50,000 tons in 1880 to 120,000 tons in 1890, to 210,000 tons\r\nin 1900, and to 260,000 tons in 1905. The nitrogen produced in the\r\nshape of ammonium salts (sulphate) by the gas-works of Europe amounts\r\nto about one-quarter of the last-mentioned figure. To this figure we\r\nhave, of course, to add the production of coal-gas ammonia in the\r\nUnited States and elsewhere. Yet even allowing for this item, we shall\r\nfind that the artificial supply of combined nitrogen on the earth does\r\nnot represent more than about one-thousandth of the natural supply.\r\n\r\nAs the nitrogen contents of the air may be estimated at 3980 billion\r\ntons, we recognize that only one part in three millions of the nitrogen\r\nof the atmosphere is every year fixed by electric discharges, presuming\r\nthat the nitrogen supply to the sea is as great per square kilometre\r\nas to the land. The nitrogen thus fixed benefits the plants of the sea\r\nand of the land, and passes back into the atmosphere or into the water\r\nduring the life of the plants or during their decay. Water absorbs\r\nsome nitrogen, and equilibrium between the nitrogen contents of the\r\natmosphere and of the sea is thus maintained. Hence we need not fear\r\nany noteworthy depletion of the nitrogen contents of the air. This\r\nconclusion is in accord with the fact that no notable accumulation of\r\nfixed nitrogen appears to have taken place in the solid and liquid\r\nconstituents of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe reader may remember (compare page 57) that during the annual cycle\r\nof vegetation not less than one-fiftieth of the atmospheric contents\r\nin the carbon dioxide is absorbed. Since oxygen is formed from this\r\ncarbon dioxide, and since the air contains about seven hundred times as\r\nmany parts per volume of oxygen as of carbon dioxide, the exchange of\r\natmospheric oxygen is about one part in thirty-five thousand. In other\r\nwords, the oxygen of the air participates about one hundred times more\r\nenergetically in the processes of vegetation than the nitrogen, and\r\nthis is in accordance with the general high chemical activity of oxygen.\r\n\r\nBefore we close this chapter we will briefly refer to the peculiar\r\nphenomenon known as the Zodiacal Light, which can be seen in the\r\ntropics almost any clear night for a few hours after or before sunset\r\nor sunrise. In our latitudes the light is rarely visible, and is best\r\nseen about the periods of the vernal and autumnal equinoxes. The\r\nphenomenon is generally described as a luminous cone whose basis lies\r\non the horizon, and whose middle line coincides with the zodiac. Hence\r\nthe name. According to Wright and Liais, its spectrum is continuous. It\r\nis stated that the Zodiacal Light is as strong in the tropics as that\r\nof the Milky Way.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 44.—Zodiacal Light in the tropics]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that this glow is due to dust particles\r\nilluminated by the sun. It has therefore been assumed that this dust is\r\nfloating about the sun in a ring, and that it represents the rest of\r\nthat primeval nebula out of which the solar system has been condensed,\r\naccording to the theory of Kant and Laplace (compare Chapter VII.).\r\nSometimes a fairly luminous band seems to shoot out from the apex of\r\nthe cone of the Zodiacal Light and to cross the sky in the plane of\r\nthe ecliptic. In that part of the sky which is just opposite the sun\r\nthis band expands to a larger, diffused, not well-defined spot of\r\nlight covering about 12° of arc in latitude and 90° in longitude. This\r\nluminescence is called the counter-glow (Gegenschein), and was first\r\ndescribed by Pezenas in 1780.\r\n\r\nThe most probable view concerning the nature of this counter-glow is\r\nthat it is caused by small particles of meteorites or dust which fall\r\ntowards the sun. Like the position of the corona of the aurora, the\r\nposition of this counter-glow seems to be an effect of perspective; the\r\norbits of the little particles are directed towards the sun, and they\r\ntherefore appear to radiate from a point opposite to it.\r\n\r\nWe know very little about this phenomenon. Even the position of the\r\nZodiacal Light along the zodiac which has given rise to its name\r\nhas been questioned, and it would appear from recent investigations\r\nthat the glow is situated in the plane of the solar equator. However\r\nthat may be, the view is very generally held that the glow is due to\r\nparticles which come from the sun or enter into it. We have already\r\nadduced arguments to prove that the mass of solar dust cannot be\r\nunimportant; this dust may therefore be the cause of the phenomenon\r\nwhich we have just been discussing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VI\r\n\r\n                    END OF THE SUN—ORIGIN OF NEBULÆ\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the sun is dissipating and wasting almost\r\ninconceivable amounts of heat every year: 3.8. 10^{33} gramme-calories,\r\ncorresponding to 2 gramme-calories for each gramme of its mass. We have\r\nalso obtained an idea as to how the enormous storage of heat energy in\r\nthe sun may endure this loss for ages. Finally, however, the time must\r\ncome when the sun will cool down and when it will cover itself with a\r\nsolid crust, as the earth and the other planets—so far, probably, in a\r\ngaseous state—have done long since or will do before long. No living\r\nbeing will be able to watch this extinction of the sun despairingly\r\nfrom one of the wandering planets; for, in spite of all our inventions,\r\nall life will long before have ceased on the satellites of the sun for\r\nwant of heat and light.\r\n\r\nThe further development of the cold sun will recall the actual progress\r\nof our earth, except in so far as the sun will have no life-spending,\r\ncentral source of light and heat near it. In the beginning the thin,\r\nsolid crust will again and again be burst by gases, and streams of\r\nlava will rush out from the interior of the sun. After a while these\r\npowerful discharges will stop, the lava will freeze, and the fragments\r\nwill close up more firmly than before. Only on some of the old\r\nfissures volcanoes will rise and allow the gases to escape from the\r\ninterior—water vapor and, to a less extent, carbonic acid, liberated\r\nby the cooling.\r\n\r\nThen water will be condensed. Oceans will flood the sun, and for a\r\nshort period it will resemble the earth in its present condition,\r\nthough with the one important difference. The extinct sun, unlike\r\nour earth, will not receive life-giving heat from the outside,\r\nexcepting the small amount of radiation from universal space and\r\nthe heat generated by the fall of meteorites. The temperature fall\r\nwill therefore be rapid, and the vanishing clouds of the attenuated\r\natmosphere will not long check radiation. The ocean will become\r\ncovered with a crust of ice. Then the carbonic acid will commence\r\nto condense, and will be precipitated as a light snow in the solar\r\natmosphere. Finally, at a temperature of about -200° Cent., the gases\r\nof the atmosphere will be condensed, and new oceans, now principally\r\nof nitrogen, will be produced. Let the temperature sink another 20°,\r\nand the energy of the inrushing meteorites will just suffice to balance\r\na further loss of heat by radiation. The solar atmosphere will then\r\nconsist essentially of helium and hydrogen—the two gases which are\r\nmost difficult to condense—and of some nitrogen.\r\n\r\nIn this stage the heat loss of the sun will be almost imperceptible.\r\nOwing to the low thermal conductive power of the earth’s crust,\r\nthere escapes through each square mile of this crust scarcely\r\none-thousand-millionth part of the heat which the sun is radiating\r\nfrom an equal area of its surface. In future days, when the solar\r\ncrust will have attained a thickness of 60 km. (40 miles), its loss\r\nof heat will be diminished to the same degree. The temperature on the\r\nsurface of the sun may then still be some 50° or 60° above absolute\r\nzero, and volcanic eruptions will raise the temperature only for short\r\nperiods and over small areas. Yet in the interior the temperature will\r\nstill be at nearly the same actual intensity, something like several\r\nmillion degrees, and the compounds of infinite explosive energy will\r\nbe stored up there as today. Like an immense dynamite magazine, the\r\ndark sun will float about in universal space without wasting much\r\nof its energy in the course of billions of years. Immutable, like a\r\nspore, it will retain its immense store of force until it is awakened\r\nby external forces into a new span of life similar to the old life. A\r\nslow shrinkage of the surface, due to the progressive loss of heat of\r\nthe core and to the consequent contraction, will in the meanwhile have\r\ncovered the sun with the wrinkles of old age.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that the crusts of the sun and the earth have the same\r\nthermal conductivity—namely, that of granite. According to Homén, a\r\nslab of granite one centimetre in thickness, whose two surfaces are\r\nat a temperature difference of 1° Cent., will permit 0.582 calorie\r\nto pass per minute per square centimetre of surface. By analogy, the\r\nearth’s crust, with an increase of temperature of 30° per kilometre,\r\nas we penetrate inward, would allow 1.75 .10^{-4} calorie to pass per\r\nminute and per square centimetre (this is 1/3580 of the mean heat\r\nsupply of the earth, 0.625 calorie per minute per square centimetre);\r\nwhile the sun, with a crust of the same thickness as the earth, but\r\nwith a diameter 108.6 times larger, would lose 3.3 times more heat per\r\nminute than the earth receives from it at the present time. At present\r\nthe sun loses 2260 million times more heat than the earth receives;\r\nconsequently, the loss of heat would be reduced to 1/686,000,000 of\r\nthe present amount. If the thickness of the solar crust amounted to\r\n1/140 of the solar radius—that is to say, to the same fraction that\r\nthe thickness of the earth’s crust represents of the terrestrial\r\nradius—the sun would in 74,500 million years not lose any more heat\r\nthan it does now in a single year. This number has to be diminished, on\r\naccount of the colder surface which the sun would have by that time,\r\nto about 60,000 million years. Considering that the mean temperature\r\nof the sun may be as high as 5 million degrees Celsius, the cooling\r\ndown to the freezing-point of water might occupy 150,000 billion years,\r\nassuming that its mean specific heat is as great as that of water.\r\nDuring this time the crust of the sun would increase in thickness and\r\nthe cooling would, of course, proceed at a decreasing rate. In any\r\ncase, the total loss of energy during a period of a thousand billion\r\nyears could, under these circumstances, only constitute a very small\r\nfraction of the total stored energy.\r\n\r\nWhen an extinct star moves forward through infinite spaces of time, it\r\nwill ultimately meet another luminous or likewise extinct star. The\r\nprobability of such a collision is proportional to the angle under\r\nwhich the star appears—which, though very small, is not of zero\r\nmagnitude—and to the velocity of the sun. The probability is increased\r\nby the deflection which these celestial bodies will undergo in their\r\norbits on approaching each other. Our nearest neighbors in the stellar\r\nuniverse are so far removed from us that light, the light of our sun,\r\nrequires, on an average, perhaps ten years to reach them. In order\r\nthat the sun, with its actual dimensions and its actual velocity in\r\nspace—20 km. (13 miles) per second—should collide with another star\r\nof similar kind, we should require something like a hundred thousand\r\nbillion years. Suppose that there are a hundred times more extinct than\r\nluminous stars—an assumption which is not unjustifiable—the probable\r\ninterval up to the next collision may be something like a thousand\r\nbillion years. The time during which the sun would be luminous would\r\nrepresent perhaps one-hundredth of this—that is to say, ten billion\r\nyears. This conclusion does not look unreasonable. For life has only\r\nbeen existing on the earth for about a thousand million years, and this\r\nage represents only a small fraction of the time during which the sun\r\nhas emitted light and will continue to emit light. The probability of\r\na collision between the sun and a nebula is, of course, much greater;\r\nfor the nebulæ extend over very large spaces. In such a case, however,\r\nwe need not apprehend any more serious consequences than result when a\r\ncomet is passing through the corona of the sun. Owing to the very small\r\namount of matter in the corona, we have not perceived any noteworthy\r\neffects in these instances. Nevertheless, the entrance of the sun into\r\na nebula would increase the chance of a collision with another sun; for\r\nwe shall see below that dark and luminous celestial bodies appear to be\r\naggregated in the nebulæ.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time we see new stars suddenly flash up in the sky,\r\nrapidly decrease in splendor again, to become extinguished or, at\r\nany rate, to dwindle down to faint visibility once more. The most\r\nremarkable of these exceedingly interesting events occurred in\r\nFebruary, 1901, when a star of the first magnitude appeared in the\r\nconstellation of Perseus. This star was discovered by Anderson, a\r\nScotchman, on the morning of February 22, 1901. It was then a star of\r\nthe third magnitude.[12] On a photograph which had been taken only\r\ntwenty-eight hours previous to the discovery of this star, the star\r\nwas not visible at all, although the plate marked stars down to the\r\ntwelfth magnitude. The light intensity of this new star would hence\r\nappear to have increased more than five-thousand-fold within that\r\nshort space of time. On February 23d the new star surpassed all other\r\nstars except Sirius in intensity. By February 25th it was of the first\r\nmagnitude, by February 27th of the second, by March 6th of the third,\r\nand by March 18th of the fourth magnitude. Then its brightness began to\r\nfluctuate periodically up to June 22d, with a period first of three,\r\nthen of five days, while the average light intensity decreased. By\r\nJune 23d it was of the sixth magnitude. The light intensity diminished\r\nthen more uniformly. By October, 1901, it was a star of the seventh\r\nmagnitude; by February, 1902, of the eighth magnitude; by July, 1902,\r\nof the ninth magnitude; by December, 1902, of the tenth magnitude; and\r\nsince then it has gradually dwindled to the twelfth magnitude. When\r\nthis star was at its highest intensity it shone with a bluish-white\r\nlight. The shade then changed into yellow, and by the beginning of\r\nMarch, 1901, into reddish. During its periodical fluctuations the hue\r\nwas whitish yellow at its maximum and reddish at its minimum intensity.\r\nSince then the color has gradually passed into pure white.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: Stars are classified in magnitude, the order\r\n    being such that the most luminous stars have the lowest\r\n    numbers. A star of the first magnitude is 2.52 times brighter\r\n    than a star of the second magnitude; this, again, 2.52 times\r\n    brighter than a star of the third magnitude, and so on. All\r\n    this from the point of view of an observer on the earth.]\r\n\r\nThe spectrum of this star shows the greatest similarity to that of the\r\nnew star in the constellation Auriga (Nova Aurigæ) of the year 1892\r\n(Fig. 45).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 45.—Spectrum of Nova Aurigæ, 1892]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it is characteristic of new stars that the spectrum lines\r\nappear double—dark on the violet and bright on the red side. In the\r\nspectrum of Nova Aurigæ this peculiarity is, among others, striking\r\nin the three hydrogen lines C, F, and H, in the sodium line, in the\r\nnebula lines, and also in the magnesium line. In the spectrum of\r\nNova Persei the displacement of the hydrogen lines towards the violet\r\nis so great that, according to Doppler’s principle,[13] the hydrogen\r\ngas which absorbed the light must have been moving towards us with\r\na velocity of 700 or more kilometres (450 miles) per second. Some\r\ncalcium lines show a similar displacement, which is less noticeable\r\nin the case of the other metals. This would appear to indicate that\r\nrelatively cold masses of gas are issuing from the stars and streaming\r\nwith enormous velocities towards the earth. The luminous parts of the\r\nstars were either at a stand-still or they were moving away from us.\r\nThe simplest explanation of these phenomena would be that a star when\r\nflashing up by virtue of its high temperature and high pressure shows\r\nenhanced (widened) spectral lines, whose violet portion is absorbed by\r\nthe strongly cooled masses of gas which are moving towards us and are\r\ncooled by their own strong expansion. These gases stream, of course, in\r\nall directions from the star, but we only become aware of those gases\r\nwhich absorb the light of the stars—that is to say, those situated\r\nbetween the star and the earth, and streaming in our direction.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: When, standing on a station platform, we watch\r\n    an express train rushing through the station, the pitch of the\r\n    engine whistle seems to become higher as long as the train\r\n    is approaching us, and deeper again when the train is moving\r\n    away from us. The pitch of a note depends upon the number of\r\n    oscillations which our ear receives per second. Now, when the\r\n    train is fast approaching us, more vibrations are sent into our\r\n    ear than when the train is at a stand-still, and the pitch,\r\n    therefore, appears to become higher. The same reasoning holds\r\n    for light waves, of which Doppler, of Prague (Bohemia), was in\r\n    fact thinking when first announcing his principle in 1842. The\r\n    wave-length of a particular color of the spectrum is fixed with\r\n    the aid of some Fraunhofer line characteristic of a certain\r\n    metal. If we compare the spectrum of a star and the spectrum of\r\n    a glowing metal, photographed on the same plate, the stellar\r\n    lines will appear shifted towards the violet end (violet light\r\n    is produced by nearly twice as many vibrations of the ether per\r\n    second as red light) when the star is moving towards us in the\r\n    line of sight. This principle has successfully been applied by\r\n    Huggins, H. C. Vogel, and others, for determining the motion\r\n    of a star in our line of sight. When a star is revolving about\r\n    its own axis, the equatorial belt will seem to come nearer to\r\n    us (or to recede from us), while the polar regions will seem to\r\n    be at a stand-still; the lines will then appear oblique (not\r\n    vertical). In this way Keeler proved that the rings of Saturn\r\n    consists of swarms of meteorites moving at different velocities\r\n    in the different rings.—H. B.]\r\n\r\nGradually the light of the metallic lines and of the continuous\r\nspectrum on which they were superposed began to fade, first in the\r\nviolet, while the hydrogen lines and nebular lines still remained\r\ndistinct; like other new stars, this star showed, after a while, the\r\nnebular spectrum. This interesting fact was first noticed by H. C.\r\nVogel in the new star in the Swan (Nova Cygni, 1876). The star P in the\r\nSwan, which flashed up in the year 1600, still offers us a spectrum\r\nwhich indicates the emission of hydrogen gas. It is not impossible\r\nthat this “new” star has not yet reached its equilibrium, and is still\r\ncontinuing to emit cold streams of gases. Insignificant quantities\r\nof gas suffice for the formation of an absorption spectrum; thus the\r\nemission of gas might continue for long periods without exhausting the\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned (page 116) the peculiar clouds of light which\r\nwere observed around Nova Persei. Two annular clouds moved away from\r\nthis star with velocities of 1.4 and 2.8 seconds of arc per day between\r\nMarch 29, 1901, and February, 1902. If we calculate backward from\r\nthese dates the time which must have elapsed since those gases left the\r\nstar, we arrive at the date of the week—February 8 to 16, 1901—in\r\nsatisfactory agreement with the period of greatest luminosity of the\r\nstar of February 23d. It would, therefore, appear that these emanations\r\ncame from the star and were ejected by the radiation pressure. Their\r\nlight did not mark any noticeable polarization, and could not be\r\nreflected light for this reason. We may suppose that the dust particles\r\ndischarged their electric charges, and that the gases became thereby\r\nluminous.\r\n\r\nIn this case we were evidently witnesses of the grand _finale_ of\r\nthe independent existence of a celestial body by collision with some\r\nother body of equal kind. The two colliding bodies were both dark, or\r\nthey emitted so little light that their combined light intensities\r\ndid not equal that of a star of the twelfth magnitude. As, now, their\r\nsplendor after the collision was greater than that of a star of the\r\nfirst magnitude, although their distance has been estimated to be at\r\nleast 120 light years,[14] their radiation intensity must have exceeded\r\nthat of the sun several thousand times. Under these circumstances the\r\nmechanical radiation pressure must also have been many times more\r\npowerful than on the surface of the sun, and the masses of dust which\r\nwere ejected by the new star must have possessed a velocity very much\r\ngreater than that of solar dust. Yet this velocity must have been\r\nsmaller than that of light, which, indeed, the effect of the radiation\r\npressure can never equal.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 14: One light year corresponds to 9.5 billion\r\n    kilometres, and it is the distance which the light traverses in\r\n    the course of a year.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 46.—Diagram indicating the consequences\r\n    of a collision between two extinct suns, A and B ‘moving’ in\r\n    the direction of the straight arrows. A rapid rotation in\r\n    the direction of the curved arrows results, and two powerful\r\n    streamers are ejected by A B, the explosive substances from the\r\n    deeper strata of A and B being brought up to the surface by the\r\n    collision]\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to picture to ourselves the enormous violence\r\nwith which this “collision” must have taken place. A strange body—for\r\ninstance, a meteorite—which rushes from the infinite universe into\r\nthe sun has at its collision a velocity of 600 km. (400 miles) per\r\nsecond, and the velocity of the two colliding suns must have been\r\nof approximately that order. The impact will in general be oblique,\r\nand, although part of the energy will of course be transformed into\r\nheat, the rest of the kinetic energy must have produced a rotational\r\nvelocity of hundreds of kilometres per second. By comparison with\r\nthis number the actual circumferential speed of the sun, about 2 km.\r\n(1-1/4 miles) per second on the equator, would vanish altogether; and\r\nthe difference is still more striking for the earth, with its 0.465\r\nkm. per second at the equator. We shall, therefore, not commit an\r\nerror of any consequence if we presume the two bodies to have been\r\npractically devoid of circumferential speeds before their collision. At\r\nthe collision, matter will have been ejected from both these celestial\r\nbodies at right angles to the relative directions of their motion in\r\ntwo powerful torrents, which would be situated in the plane in which\r\nthe two bodies were approaching each other (compare Fig. 46). The\r\nrotational speed of the double star, which will be diminished by this\r\nejection of matter, will have contributed to increase the energy of\r\nejection. We remember, now, that when matter is brought up from the\r\ninterior to the surface of the sun it will behave like an explosive of\r\nenormous power. The ejected gases will be hurled in terrific flight\r\nabout the rapidly revolving central portions. We obtain an idea (though\r\na very imperfect one) of these features when we look at a revolving\r\npinwheel in a fireworks display. Two pinwheels have been attached\r\nto the ends of a diameter and belch forth fire in radial lines. The\r\nfarther removed from the wheel, the smaller will be the actual velocity\r\nand also the angular velocity of these torrents of fire. Similarly with\r\nthe star. The streams are rapidly cooled, owing to the rapid expansion\r\nof the gas. They will also contain fine dust, largely consisting of\r\ncarbon, probably, which had been bound by the explosive materials.\r\nThe clouds of fine dust will obscure the new star more and more, and\r\nwill gradually change its white brilliancy into yellow and reddish,\r\nbecause the fine dust weakens blue-and-green rays more than it does\r\nyellow-and-red rays. At first the clouds were so near to the star that\r\nthey possessed a high angular velocity of their own; they then appeared\r\nto surround the star completely. But after March 22, 1901, the outer\r\nparticles of the streams attained greater distances and assumed longer\r\nperiods of revolution (six days); the star then became more obscured\r\nwhen the extreme dust clouds of the streams covering it happened to\r\nget between us and the star. As the streams of particles were moving\r\nfarther away, their rotational periods increased gradually to ten days.\r\nThe star, therefore, became periodical with a slowly growing length\r\nof period, and its glow turned more reddish at its minimum than at\r\nits maximum of intensity. At the same time, the absorptive power of\r\nthe marginal particles decreased, partly owing to their increasing\r\nexpansion, partly because the dust was slowly aggregating to coarser\r\nparticles; possibly, also, because the finest particles were being\r\ndriven away by the radiation pressure. The sifting influence which the\r\ndust exercised upon the light, and owing to which the red-and-yellow\r\nrays were more readily transmitted than the blue-and-green, gradually\r\nbecame impaired; hence the color of the light turned more gray, and\r\nafter a certain time the star appeared once more of a whitish hue.\r\nThis white color indicates that the star must still have a very high\r\ntemperature. By the continued ejection of dust-charged masses of gas,\r\nprobably with gradually decreasing violence, the light intensity of the\r\nstar must slowly diminish (as seen from the earth) and the distribution\r\nof the layers of dust around the luminous core will more and more\r\nbecome uniform. How violent the explosion must have been, we recognize\r\nfrom the observation that the first ejected masses of hydrogen\r\nrushed out with an apparent velocity of at least 700 km. per second.\r\nThis velocity is of the same order as that of the most remarkable\r\nprominences of the sun.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 47.—Spiral nebula in the Canes Venatici.\r\n    Messier 51. Taken at the Yerkes Observatory on June 3, 1902.\r\n    Scale, 1 mm. = 13.2 sec. of arc]\r\n\r\nIt will be admitted that these arguments present us with a faithful\r\nsimile even of the details of the observed course of events, and it is\r\ntherefore highly probable that our view is in the main correct. But\r\nwhat has meanwhile become of the new star? Spectrum analysis tells\r\nus that it has been converted into a stellar nebula like other new\r\nstars. The continuous light of the central body has more and more been\r\nweakened by the surrounding masses of dust. By the radiation pressure\r\nthese masses are driven towards the outer particles of the surrounding\r\ngaseous envelope consisting principally of hydrogen, helium, and\r\n“nebular matter.” There the dust discharges its negative electricity,\r\nand thus calls forth a luminescence which equals that of the nebulæ.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 48.—Spiral nebula in the Triangle. Messier\r\n    33. Taken at the Yerkes Observatory on September 4 and 6, 1902.\r\n    Scale, 1 mm. = 30.7 sec. of arc]\r\n\r\nWe have to consider next that owing to the incredibly rapid rotation,\r\nthe central main mass of the two stars will, in its outer portions,\r\nbe exposed to centrifugal forces of extraordinary intensity, and will\r\ntherefore become flattened out to a large revolving disk.[15] As the\r\npressure in the outer portions will be relatively small, the density of\r\nthe gases will likewise be diminished there. The energetic expansion\r\nand, more still, the great heat radiation will lower the temperature\r\nat a rapid rate. We have thus to deal with a central body whose inner\r\nportion will possess a high density, and which will resemble the mass\r\nof the sun, while the outer portion will be attenuated and nebular.\r\nDistributed about the central body we shall find the rest of the two\r\nstreams of gases which were ejected immediately after the violent\r\ncollision between the two celestial bodies. A not inconsiderable\r\nportion of the matter of these spirally arranged outer parts will\r\nprobably travel farther away into infinite space, finally to join some\r\nother celestial body or to form parts of the great irregular spots of\r\nnebular matter which are collected around the star clusters. Another\r\nportion, not able to leave the central body, will remain in circular\r\nmovement about it. In consequence of this circular movement, which\r\nwill be extremely slow, the outlines of the two spirals will gradually\r\nbecome obliterated, and the spirals will themselves more and more\r\nassume the shape of nebular rings about the central mass.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15: A. Ritter has calculated that when two suns of\r\n    equal size collide with one another from an infinite distance,\r\n    the energy of the collision is not more than sufficient to\r\n    enlarge the volume of the suns to four times the previous\r\n    amount. The largest portion of the mass will therefore probably\r\n    remain in the centre, and it will only be masses of light gases\r\n    which will be ejected.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 49.—The great nebula in Andromeda. Taken at\r\n    the Yerkes Observatory on September 18, 1901. Scale, 1 mm. =\r\n    54.6 sec. of arc]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 50.—Ring-shaped nebula in Lyra. Taken at\r\n    the Yerkes Observatory]\r\n\r\nThis spiral form (Figs. 47 and 48) of the outer portions of the nebulæ\r\nhas for a long time excited the greatest attention. In almost all the\r\ninvestigated instances it has been observed that two spiral branches\r\nare coiling about the central body. This would indicate that the matter\r\nis in a revolving movement about the central axis of the spiral, and\r\nthat it has streamed away from the axis in two opposite directions.\r\nSometimes the matter appears arranged as in a coil; of this type the\r\ngreat nebula of Andromeda is the best-known example (Fig. 49). A closer\r\ninspection of this nebula with more powerful instruments indicates,\r\nhowever, that it is also spiral and that it appears coiled, because we\r\nare looking at it from the side. The late famous American astronomer\r\nKeeler, who has studied these nebulæ with greater success than any one\r\nelse, has catalogued a great many of them in all the divisions of the\r\nheavens which were accessible to his instruments, and he has found\r\nthat these formations are predominatingly of a spiral nature.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 51.—Central portion of the great nebula in\r\n    Orion. Taken at the Yerkes Observatory. Scale, 1 mm. = 12 sec.\r\n    of arc]\r\n\r\nSome nebulæ, like the so-called planetary nebulæ, offer rather the\r\nappearance of luminous spheres. We may assume in these cases that the\r\nexplosions were less violent, and that the spirals, therefore, are\r\nsituated so closely together that they seem to merge into one another.\r\nPossibly the inequalities in their development have become equalized\r\nin the course of time. A few nebulæ are ring-shaped, as the well-known\r\nnebula of Lyra (see Fig. 50). These rings may, again, have been\r\nformed out of spiral nebulæ, and the spirals may have gradually been\r\nobliterated by rotation, while the central nebulous matter may have\r\nbeen concentrated on the planets travelling round the central star.\r\nSchaeberle, an eminent American astronomer, has discovered traces of\r\nspiral shape also in the Lyra nebula.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of nebula is the ordinary nebula of vast extension and\r\nirregular shape, evidently formed out of most extremely attenuated\r\nmatter; well-known characteristic examples are found in Orion, about\r\nthe Pleiades, and in the Swan (Figs. 51, 52, and 53). In these nebulæ\r\nportions of a spiral structure have likewise often been discerned.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 52.—Nebular striæ in the stars of the\r\n    Pleiades. Taken at the Yerkes Observatory on October 19, 1901.\r\n    Scale, 1 mm. = 42.2 sec. of arc]\r\n\r\nWe have said that the collision between two celestial bodies would\r\nresult in the formation of a spiral with two wings. If the impact is\r\nsuch that the two centres of the celestial bodies move straight towards\r\neach other, a disk will arise, and not a spiral; or if one star is\r\nmuch smaller than the other, possibly a cone, because the gases will\r\nuniformly be spread in all directions about the line of impact. A\r\nperfectly central impact is obviously very rare; but there may be cases\r\nwhich approach this limiting condition more or less, especially when\r\nthe relative velocity of the two bodies is small. By slow diffusion a\r\nfeebly developed spiral may also be converted into a rotating disklike\r\nstructure. The extension of these nebular structures will depend upon\r\nthe ratio between the mass of the system and the velocity of ejection\r\nof the gases. If, for example, two extinct suns of nearly equal\r\ndimensions and mass, like our sun, should collide, some gas masses\r\nwould travel into infinite space, being hurled out with a velocity\r\nof more than 900 km. (550 miles) per second; while other particles,\r\nmoving at a slower rate, would remain in the neighborhood of the\r\ncentral body. The nearer to that body, the smaller was their velocity.\r\nFrom their position they might fall back into the central body, to be\r\nreincorporated in it, if two circumstances did not prevent this. The\r\none circumstance is the enormous radiation pressure of the glowing\r\ncentral mass. That pressure keeps masses of dust particles floating,\r\nwhich by friction will carry the surrounding masses of gas with them.\r\nOwing to the absorption of the radiation by the dust particles, only\r\nthe finer particles will be supported farther outside, and at the\r\nextreme margin of the nebula even the very finest dust will no longer\r\nbe maintained in suspension by the greatly weakened radiation pressure.\r\nThus we arrive at an outer limit for the nebula. The other circumstance\r\nis the violent rotation which is set up by the impact of the central\r\nbodies. The rotation and the centrifugal forces will produce a\r\ndisk-shaped expansion of the whole central mass. Owing to molecular\r\ncollisions and to tidal effects, the angular velocity will in the\r\ndenser portions tend to become uniform, so that the whole will rotate\r\nlike a flattened-out ball filled with gas, and the spiral structure\r\nwill gradually disappear in those parts. In the more remote particles\r\nthe velocity will only increase to such an extent as to equal that of\r\na planet moving at the same distance—that is to say, the gravitation\r\ntowards the central body will be balanced by the centrifugal force, and\r\nat the very greatest distances the molecular bombardments, as well as\r\ngravitation towards the centre, will become so insignificant that any\r\nmasses collected there will retain their shape for an almost unlimited\r\nspace of time.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of this system the main bulk of the matter would be\r\nconcentrated in a sun of extreme brightness, whose light intensity\r\nwould, however, owing to strong radiation, diminish with comparative\r\nrapidity.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 53.—Nebular striæ in the Swan. New General\r\n    Catalogue, 6992. Taken at the Yerkes Observatory on October 5,\r\n    1901. Scale, 1 mm. = 41 sec. of arc]\r\n\r\nSuch an extensive nebular system, in which gravitation, on account\r\nof the enormous distances, would act feebly and very slowly, would\r\nyet, in spite of the extraordinary attenuation of matter in its outer\r\nportions, and just on account of its vast extension, be able to stop\r\nthe movement of the particles of dust penetrating into it. If the\r\ngases of the nebula are not to escape into space, notwithstanding the\r\ninfinitesimal gravitation, their molecules must be assumed to be almost\r\nat a stand-still, and their temperature must not rise by more than\r\n50° or 60° Cent. above absolute zero. At such low temperatures the\r\nso-called adsorption plays an enormously important part (Dewar). The\r\nsmall dust particles form centres about which the gases are condensed\r\nto a remarkable degree. The extremely low density of these gases does\r\nnot prevent their condensation; for the adsorption phenomenon follows a\r\nlaw according to which the mass of condensed gas will only be reduced\r\nby about one-tenth when the density of the surrounding gas has been\r\ndecreased by one-ten-thousandth. The mass of dust particles or dust\r\ngrains will thus be augmented, and when they collide they will be\r\ncemented together by the semiliquid films condensed upon them. There\r\nmust, hence, be a relatively energetic formation of meteorites in\r\nthe nebulæ, and especially in their interiors. Then stars and their\r\nsatellites, migrating through space, will stray into these swarms of\r\ngases and meteorites within the nebulæ. The larger and more rapidly\r\nmoving celestial bodies will crush through this relatively less dense\r\nmatter; but thousands of years may yet be occupied in their passing\r\nthrough nebulæ of vast dimensions.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 54.—Nebula and star rift in the Swan, in\r\n    the Milky Way. Taken by M. Wolf, Königstuhl, near Heidelberg]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 55.—Great nebula near Rho, in Ophiuchus.\r\n    Photograph by E. E. Barnard, Lick Observatory. There are\r\n    several empty spots and rifts near the larger stars of the\r\n    nebula]\r\n\r\nAn extraordinarily interesting photograph obtained by the celebrated\r\nProfessor Max Wolf, of Heidelberg, shows us a part of the nebula in\r\nthe Swan into which a star has penetrated from outside. The intruder\r\nhas collected about it the nebulous matter it met on its way, and\r\nhas thus left an empty channel behind it marking its track. Similar\r\nspots of vast extent, relatively devoid of nebulous matter, occur\r\nvery frequently in the irregular nebulæ; they are frequently called\r\n“fissures,” or by the specifically English term “rifts,” because they\r\nhave generally a long-drawn-out appearance. The presumption that these\r\nrifts represent the tracks of large celestial bodies which have cut\r\ntheir way through widely expanded nebular masses (Fig. 54) has been\r\nentertained for a long time.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 56.—Star cluster in Hercules. Messier 13.\r\n    Taken at the Yerkes Observatory. Scale, 1 mm. = 9.22 sec. of\r\n    arc]\r\n\r\nThe smaller and more slowly moving immigrants, on the other hand,\r\nare stopped by the particles of the nebulæ. We therefore see the\r\nstars more sparsely distributed in the immediate neighborhood of\r\nthe nebulæ, while in the nebulæ themselves they appear more densely\r\ncrowded. This fact had struck Herschel in his observations of nebulæ;\r\nin recent days it has been investigated by Courvoisier and M. Wolf. In\r\nthis way several centres of attraction are created in a nebula; they\r\ncondense the gases surrounding the nebula, and catch, so to say, any\r\nstray meteorites and collect them especially in the inner portions of\r\nthe nebula. We frequently observe, further, how the nebular matter\r\nappears attenuated at a certain distance from the luminous bright\r\nstars (compare Figs. 52 and 55). Finally, the nebulæ change into star\r\nclusters which still retain the characteristic shapes of the nebulæ;\r\nof these the spiral is the most usual, while we also meet with conical\r\nshapes, originating from conical nebulæ, and spherical shapes (compare\r\nFigs. 56, 57, and 58).\r\n\r\nThis is, broadly, the type of evolution through which Herschel,\r\nrelying upon his observations, presumed a nebula to pass. He was,\r\nhowever, under the impression that the nebulous matter would directly\r\nbe condensed into star clusters without the aid of strange celestial\r\nimmigrants.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 57.—Star cluster in Pegasus. Messier 15.\r\n    Taken at the Yerkes Observatory. Scale, 1 mm. = 6.4 sec. of arc]\r\n\r\nIt has been known since the most ancient times, and has been confirmed\r\nby the observations of Herschel and others in a most convincing manner,\r\nthat the stars are strongly concentrated about the middle line of the\r\nMilky Way. It is not improbable that there was originally a nebula of\r\nenormous dimensions in the plane of the Milky Way, produced possibly by\r\nthe collision of two such giant suns as Arcturus. This gigantic nebula\r\nhas gathered up the smaller migrating celestial bodies which, in their\r\nturn, have condensed upon themselves nebular matter, and have thereby\r\nbecome incandescent, if they were not so before. The rotational\r\nmovement in those parts which were far removed from the centre of the\r\nMilky Way may be neglected. At a later period collisions succeeded\r\nbetween the single stars which had been gathered up, and it is for this\r\nreason that gaseous nebulæ, as well as new stars, are comparatively\r\nfrequent phenomena in the plane of the Milky Way. This view may some\r\nday receive confirmation, when we succeed in proving the existence of\r\na central body in the Milky Way, evidence of which might possibly be\r\ndeduced from the curvature of the orbits of the sun or of other stars.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 58.—Cone-shaped star cluster in Gemini.]\r\n\r\nAs regards the ring-shaped nebula in the Lyre (Fig. 50), the most\r\nrecent measurements made by Newkirk point to the result that the star\r\nvisible in its centre is distant from us about thirty-two light-years.\r\nAs it appears probable that this star really forms the central core\r\nof the nebula, the distance of the nebula itself must be thirty-two\r\nlight-years. From the diameter of the ring-shaped nebula which Newkirk\r\nestimates at one minute of arc, this astronomer has calculated that\r\nthe distance of the ring from its central body is equal to about three\r\nhundred times the radius of the earth’s orbit—that is to say, the ring\r\nis about ten times as far from its sun as Neptune is from our sun.\r\nThere is a faint luminescence within this ring. The nebular matter may\r\noriginally have been more concentrated at this spot than in the outer\r\nportions of the ring itself. But this mass was probably condensed on\r\nmeteors which immigrated from outside, and when these meteors coalesced\r\ndark planets were produced which move about the central body, and which\r\nhave gathered about them most of the gases. If that central body were\r\nas heavy as our sun, the matter in the ring should revolve about it\r\nin five thousand years. That rotation would suffice to wipe out the\r\noriginal spiral shape, enough of which has yet been left to permit of\r\nour distinctly discerning the two wings of the spiral. The central\r\nbody of this ring-shaped nebula gives a continuous spectrum of bright\r\nlines which is particularly developed on the violet side. The star\r\nwould therefore appear to be much younger and much hotter than our\r\nsun, and its radiation pressure would therefore be much more intense.\r\nThe period of rotation of the nebula may, for this reason, have to be\r\nestimated at a considerably higher figure.\r\n\r\nThe eminent Dutch astronomer Kapteyn has deduced from the proper\r\nmotions of 168 nebulæ that their average distance from the earth is\r\nabout seven hundred light-years and equal to that of stars of the tenth\r\nmagnitude. The old idea, that the nebulæ must be infinitely farther\r\nremoved from us than the fainter stars, would therefore appear to be\r\nerroneous. According to the measurements of Professor Bohlin, the\r\nnebula in Andromeda may indeed be at a distance of not more than forty\r\nlight-years.\r\n\r\nThe “new stars” form a group among the peculiar celestial bodies which\r\non account of their variable light intensity have been designated as\r\n“variable stars,” and of which a few typical cases should be mentioned,\r\nbecause a great scientific interest attaches to these problems. The\r\nstar Eta, in Argus, may be said to illustrate the strange fate that\r\na star has to pass through when it has drifted into a nebula filled\r\nwith immigrated celestial bodies. It is one of the most peculiar\r\nvariable stars. The star shines through one of the largest nebular\r\nclouds in the heavens. Whether it stands in any physical connection\r\nwith its surroundings cannot be stated without further examination.\r\nThe star might, for instance, be at a considerable distance in front\r\nof the nebula, between the latter and ourselves. Its frequent change\r\nin light intensity suggests, however, a series of collisions, which do\r\nnot appear unnatural to us when we suppose that the star is within a\r\nnebula into which many celestial bodies have drifted.\r\n\r\nAs this star belongs to the southern hemisphere, it was not observed\r\nbefore our astronomers commenced to visit that hemisphere. In 1677\r\nit was classed as a star of the fourth magnitude; ten years later it\r\nwas of the second magnitude; the same in 1751. In 1827 it was of the\r\nfirst magnitude, and it was found to be variable—that is to say, it\r\nshone with variable brightness. Herschel observed that it fluctuated\r\nbetween the first and second magnitudes, and that it increased in\r\nbrightness after 1837, so that it was by 1838 of magnitude 0.2. After\r\nthat it began to decrease in intensity up to April, 1839, when it had\r\nthe magnitude 1.1. It remained for four years approximately at this\r\nintensity; then it increased rapidly again in 1843, and surpassed all\r\nstars except Sirius (magnitude -1.7).[16] Afterwards its intensity\r\nslowly diminished once more, so that it remained just visible to the\r\nnaked eye (sixth magnitude); by 1869 it had become invisible. Since\r\nthen it has been fluctuating between the sixth and seventh magnitudes.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: This figure, -1.7, signifies that the brightness\r\n    of Sirius is 2.52^{2.7} = 12 times greater than that of a\r\n    star of magnitude 1. Next to Sirius comes Canopus, with\r\n    magnitude -1.0, being 6.3 times brighter than a star of\r\n    magnitude 1.]\r\n\r\nThe last changes in the intensity of this star strongly recall the\r\nbehavior of the new star in Perseus, only that the latter has been\r\npassing through its phases at a much more rapid rate. It appears to\r\nbe certain, however, that Eta, in Argus, was from the very beginning\r\nfar brighter than Nova Persei, and that at least once before the\r\ngreat collision in 1843 (after which it was surrounded by obscuring\r\nclouds of increasing opacity)—namely, in January, 1838, it had been\r\nexposed to a slight collision of quickly vanishing effect. This lesser\r\ncollision was probably of the kind which Mayer imagined for the earth\r\nand sun. It would give rise to heat development corresponding to the\r\nheat expenditure of the sun in about a hundred years. As it had been\r\nobserved that the star was variable in an irregular manner before\r\nthat, we may, perhaps, presume that it had already undergone another\r\ncollision.\r\n\r\nAccording to the observations of Borisiak, a student in Kief, the new\r\nstar in Perseus would have been, on the evening of February 21, 1901,\r\nof 1.5 magnitude, while a few hours previously it had been of magnitude\r\n12, and the following evening of magnitude 2.7; afterwards its\r\nintensity increased up to the following evening, when it outshone all\r\nthe other stars in the northern sky. If this statement is not based on\r\nerroneous observations, the new star must have been in collision with\r\nanother celestial body two days before its great collision, perhaps\r\nwith a small planet in the neighborhood of the sun, with which it later\r\ncollided. That would account for its temporary brilliancy.\r\n\r\nNew stars are by no means so rare as one might perhaps assume. Almost\r\nevery year some new star is discovered. By far most of these are seen\r\nin the neighborhood of the Milky Way, where the visible stars are\r\nunusually crowded, so that a collision which would become visible to us\r\nmay easily occur.\r\n\r\nFor similar reasons we find there also most of the gaseous nebulæ.\r\n\r\nMost of the star clusters are also in the neighborhood of the Milky\r\nWay. This is in consequence of the facts just alluded to. The nebulæ\r\nwhich are produced by collisions between two suns are soon crossed by\r\nmigrating celestial bodies such as meteorites or comets, which there\r\noccur in large numbers; by the condensing action of these intruders\r\nthey are then transformed into star clusters. In parts of the heavens\r\nwhere stars are relatively sparse (as at a great distance from the\r\nMilky Way), most of the nebulæ observed exhibit stellar spectra. They\r\nare nothing but star clusters, so far removed from us that the separate\r\nstars can no longer be distinguished. That single stars and gaseous\r\nnebulæ are so rarely perceived in these regions is, no doubt, due to\r\ntheir great distance.\r\n\r\nAmong the variable stars we find quite a number which display\r\nconsiderable irregularity in their fluctuations of brightness,\r\nand which remind us of the new stars. To this class belongs the\r\njust-mentioned star Eta, in Argus. Another example (the first one\r\nwhich was recognized as “variable”) is Mira Ceti, which may be\r\ntranslated, “The Wonderful Star in the Constellation of the Whale.”\r\nThis mysterious body was discovered by the Frisian priest Fabricius,\r\non August 12, 1596, as a star of the second magnitude. The priest, an\r\nexperienced astronomer, had not previously noticed this star, and he\r\nlooked for it in vain in October, 1597. In the years 1638 and 1639 the\r\nvariability of the star was recognized, and it was soon ascertained\r\nto be irregular. The period has a length of about eleven months, but\r\nit fluctuates irregularly about this figure as a mean value. At its\r\ngreatest intensity the star ranks with those of the first or second\r\norder. Sometimes it is weaker, but it is always of more than the fifth\r\nmagnitude. Ten weeks after a maximum the star is no longer visible,\r\nand its brightness may diminish to magnitude 9.5. In other words, its\r\nintensity varies about in the ratio of 1: 1000 (or possibly more).\r\nAfter a minimum the brightness once more increases, the star becomes\r\nvisible again—that is to say, it attains the sixth magnitude—and\r\nafter another six weeks it will once more be at its maximum. We have\r\nevidently to deal with several superposed periods.\r\n\r\nThe spectrum of this star is rather peculiar. It belongs to the red\r\nstars with a band spectrum which is crossed by bright hydrogen lines.\r\nThe star is receding from us with a velocity of not less than 63 km.\r\n(39 miles) per second. The bright hydrogen lines which correspond\r\nto the spectrum of the nebula may sometimes be resolved into three\r\ncomponents, of which the middle one corresponds to a mean velocity of\r\n60 km., and the two others have variable receding velocities of 35 and\r\n82 km.—that is to say, velocities of 25 or 22 km. less or more than\r\nthe mean velocity. Evidently the star is surrounded by three nebulæ;\r\none is concentrated about its centre; the two others lie on a ring\r\nthe matter of which has been concentrated on two opposite sides. The\r\nring, which recalls the ring nebula in the Lyre, seems to move about\r\nthe star with a velocity of 23.5 km. per second. As this revolution\r\nis accomplished within eleven—or, more correctly, within twenty-two\r\nmonths, since there must be two maxima and two minima during one\r\nrevolution—the total circumference of the ring will be 23.5 × 86,400 ×\r\n670—1361 millions, and the radius of its orbit 217 million km., which\r\nis 1.45 times greater than the radius of the earth’s orbit. Now the\r\nvelocity of the earth in its orbit is 29.5 km. (18.3 miles) per second.\r\nA planet at 1.45 times that distance from the sun would have the (1.203\r\ntimes smaller) velocity of 24.5 km. per second, which is approximately\r\nthat of the hypothetical ring of Mira Ceti. We conclude, therefore,\r\nthat the mass of the central sun in Mira Ceti will nearly equal the\r\nmass of our sun. The calculation really suggests that Mira would be\r\nabout eight per cent. smaller; but the difference lies within the range\r\nof the probable error.\r\n\r\nChandler has directed attention to a striking regularity in these\r\nstars. The longer the period of their variation, the redder in general\r\ntheir color. This is easily comprehended. The denser the original\r\natmosphere, the more widely the gases will have extended outward from\r\nthe star, and the more dust will have been caught or secreted by it. We\r\nhave seen that the limb of the sun has a reddish light because of the\r\nquantities of dust in the solar atmosphere. The effect is chiefly to\r\nbe ascribed to the absorption of the blue rays by the dust; but it may\r\npartly be explained on the assumption that the solar radiations render\r\nthe dust incandescent, though its temperature may be lower than that\r\nof the photosphere, because the dust lies outside the sun, and that it\r\nwill therefore emit a relatively reddish light. The more dust there is\r\nin a nebula, the redder will be its luminescence; and as the quantity\r\nof dust increases in general with the extension of the nebula, that\r\nstar which is surrounded by wider rings of nebulæ will in general be\r\nmore red; but the greater the radius of the ring, the longer also will\r\nin general be its period.\r\n\r\nThe so-called red stars show, in addition to the bright hydrogen lines,\r\nbanded spectra which indicate the presence of chemical compounds.\r\nOn this account such stars were formerly credited with a lower\r\ntemperature. But the same peculiarity is also observed in sun-spots,\r\nalthough the latter, on account of their position, must have a higher\r\ntemperature than the surrounding photosphere. The presence of bands in\r\nthe spectrum certainly suggests high pressure, however. The red stars\r\nare evidently surrounded by a very extensive atmosphere of gases, in\r\nthe inner portions of which the pressure is so high that the atoms\r\nenter into combination. The spectra of the red stars display, on the\r\nwhole, a striking resemblance to those of the sun-spots. The violet\r\nportion of the spectrum is weakened, because the masses of dust have\r\nextinguished this light. Owing to the large masses of dust which lie\r\nin our line of sight, the spectrum lines are in both cases markedly\r\nwidened and sometimes accompanied by bright lines.\r\n\r\nAnother class of stars, distinguished by bright lines, comprises those\r\nstudied by Wolf and Rayet, and named after them. These stars are\r\ncharacterized by a hydrogen atmosphere of enormous extension, large\r\nenough in some cases, it has been calculated, to fill up the orbit of\r\nNeptune. These stars are evidently either hotter and more strongly\r\nradiating than the red stars, or there is not so much dust in their\r\nneighborhood—the dust may possibly have been expelled by the strong\r\nradiating pressure. They are, therefore, classed with the yellow, and\r\nnot with the red stars. Although there is every reason to suppose that\r\ntheir central bodies are at least as hot as those of the white stars,\r\nthe dust is yet able to reduce the color to yellow, owing to the vast\r\nextensions of their atmospheres.\r\n\r\nThe unequal periods in stars like Mira may be explained by the\r\nsupposition that there are several rings of dust moving about them, as\r\nin the case of the planet Saturn. In the case of the inner rings which\r\nhave a short period, there has probably been sufficient time during\r\nthe uncounted number of revolutions to effect a uniform distribution\r\nof the dust. Hence we do not discern any noteworthy nuclei in them,\r\nsuch as we observe in the tails of comets; the dust rings only help\r\nto impart to the star a uniform reddish hue. In the outer rings the\r\ndistribution of dust will, however, not be uniform. One of the rings\r\nmay be responsible for the chief proper period. By the co-operation\r\nof other less important dust rings, the maximum or minimum, we shall\r\neasily understand, may be displaced, and thus the time interval\r\nbetween the maxima and minima be altered. This alteration of the\r\nperiod is so strong for some stars that we have not yet succeeded in\r\nestablishing any simple periodicity. The best-known star of this type\r\nis the bright-red star Betelgeuse in the constellation of Orion. The\r\nbrightness of this star fluctuates irregularly between the magnitudes\r\n1.0 and 1.4.\r\n\r\nBy far the largest number of variable stars belong to the type of Mira.\r\nOthers resemble the variable star Beta in the constellation of the\r\nLyre, and thus belong to the Lyre type. The variability of the spectra\r\nof a great many of these stars indicates that they must be moving\r\nabout a dark star as companion, or rather that they both move about a\r\ncommon centre of gravity. The change in the light intensity is, as a\r\nrule, explained by the supposition that the bright star is partially\r\nobscured at times by its dark companion. Many irregularities, however,\r\nin their periods and other circumstances prove that this explanation is\r\nnot sufficient. The assumption of rings of dust circulating about the\r\nstar and of larger condensation centres affords a better elucidation\r\nof the variability of these stars. They are grouped with the white or\r\nyellow stars, in whose surroundings the dust does not play so large a\r\npart as in that of Mira Ceti. The period of their variability is, as\r\na rule, very short, moreover—generally only a few days (the shortest\r\nknown, only four hours)—while the period of the Mira stars amounts to\r\nat least sixty-five days, and may attain two years. There may be still\r\nlonger periods so far not investigated.\r\n\r\nNearly related to the Lyre stars are the Algol stars, whose variability\r\ncan be explained by the assumption that another bright or dark star is\r\nmoving within their vicinity, partially cutting off their light. There\r\nis no dust in these cases, and the spectrum characterizes these stars\r\nas stars of the first class—that is, as white stars—so far as they\r\nhave been studied up to the present.\r\n\r\nWe must presume for all the variable stars that the line of sight from\r\nthe observer to the star falls in the plane of their dust rings or of\r\ntheir companions. If this were not so, they would appear to us like a\r\nnebula with a central condensation nucleus, or, so far as Algol stars\r\nare concerned, like the so-called spectroscopic doubles whose motion\r\nabout each other is recognized from the displacement of their spectral\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of stars from the nebulous state has been depicted by the\r\nfamous chief of the Lick Observatory, in California, W. W. Campbell, as\r\nfollows (compare the spectra of the stars of the 2d, 3d, and 4th class,\r\nFigs. 59 and 60):\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n         74         My, in     Sun        280\r\n    Schjellerup’s   Gemini   Class 2  Schjellerup’s\r\n      Catalogue     Class 3            Catalogue\r\n       Class 4                          Class 4\r\n\r\n    Fig. 59.—Comparison of spectra of stars of classes 2,\r\n    3, 4.

Wave-lengths in millionths of a\r\n    millimetre]\r\n\r\n“It is not difficult to select a long list of well-known stars which\r\ncannot be far removed from nebular conditions. These are the stars\r\ncontaining both the Huggins and the Pickering series of bright hydrogen\r\nlines, the bright lines of helium, and a few others not yet identified.\r\nGamma Argus and Zeta Puppis are of this class. Another is DM +30.3639°,\r\nwhich is actually surrounded with a spherical atmosphere of hydrogen\r\nsome five seconds of arc in diameter. A little further removed from the\r\nnebular state are the stars containing both bright and dark hydrogen\r\nlines—caught, so to speak, in the act of changing from bright-line\r\nto dark-line stars. Gamma Cassiopeiæ, Pleione, and My Centauri are\r\nexamples. Closely related to the foregoing are the helium stars. Their\r\nabsorption lines include the Huggins hydrogen series complete, a score\r\nor more of the conspicuous helium lines, frequently a few of the\r\nPickering series, and usually some inconspicuous metallic lines. The\r\nwhite stars in Orion and in the Pleiades are typical of this age.\r\n\r\n“The assignment of the foregoing types to an early place in stellar\r\nlife was first made upon the evidence of the spectroscope. The\r\nphotographic discovery of nebulous masses in the regions of a large\r\nproportion of the bright-line and helium stars affords extremely\r\nstrong confirmation of their youth. Who that has seen the nebulous\r\nbackground of Orion (Fig. 51) or the remnants of nebulosity in which\r\nthe individual stars of the Pleiades (Fig. 52) are immersed can doubt\r\nthat the stars in these groups are of recent formation?\r\n\r\n“With the lapse of time, stellar heat radiates into space, and, so\r\nfar as the individual star is concerned, is lost. On the other hand,\r\nthe force of gravity on the surface strata increases. The inevitable\r\ncontraction is accompanied by increasing average temperature. Changes\r\nin the spectrum are the necessary consequence. The second hydrogen\r\nseries vanishes, the ordinary hydrogen absorption is intensified, the\r\nhelium lines become indistinct, and calcium and iron absorptions begin\r\nto assert themselves. Vega and Sirius are conspicuous examples of this\r\nperiod. Increasing age gradually robs the hydrogen lines of their\r\nimportance, the H and K lines broaden, the metallic lines develop, the\r\nbluish-white color fades in the direction of the yellow, and, after\r\npassing through types exemplified by many well-known stars, the solar\r\nstage is reached. The reversing layer in solar stars represents but\r\nfour or five hydrogen lines of moderate intensity; the calcium lines\r\nare commandingly permanent, and some twenty thousand metallic lines are\r\nvisible. The solar type seems to be near the summit of stellar life.\r\nThe average temperature of the mass must be nearly a maximum; for the\r\nlow density indicates a constitution that is still gaseous [compare\r\nChapter VII.].\r\n\r\n“Passing time brings a lowering of the average temperature. The\r\ncolor passes from yellow to red, in consequence of lower radiation,\r\ntemperature, and increasing general absorption by the atmosphere.\r\nThe hydrogen lines become indistinct, metallic absorption remains\r\npermanent, and broad absorption bands are introduced. In one type\r\n(Secchi’s Type III.), of which Alpha Herculis is an example, these\r\nbands are of unknown origin. In another class (Secchi’s Type IV.),\r\nillustrated by the star 19 Piscium, they have been definitely\r\nidentified as of carbon origin.\r\n\r\n“There is scarcely room for doubt that these types of stars (Type\r\nIV.) are approaching the last stages of stellar development. Surface\r\ntemperatures have been lowered to the point of permitting more complex\r\nchemical combinations than those in the sun.\r\n\r\n“Secchi’s Type III. includes the several numbered long-period variable\r\nstars of the Mira Ceti class, whose spectra at maximum brilliancy show\r\nseveral bright lines of hydrogen and other chemical elements.[17] It\r\nis significant that the dull-red stars are all very faint; there are\r\nnone brighter than magnitude 5.5. Their effective radiatory power is\r\nundoubtedly very low.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: This circumstance indicates that the red color of\r\n    these stars, as we have already remarked with regard to Mira\r\n    Ceti, is not to be traced back to a low temperature, but rather\r\n    to the dust surrounding them. The most extraordinary brightness\r\n    of some stars, like Arcturus and Betelgeuse, which are redder\r\n    than the sun, and whose spectra, according to Hale, resemble\r\n    those of the sun-spots, presuppose a very high temperature.\r\n    The characteristic lines of their spectra are produced by the\r\n    relatively cool vapors of their outer portions.]\r\n\r\nThe state of evolution, which succeeds that characterized as the\r\nSecchi Type IV., may be elucidated with the aid of the examples of\r\nJupiter and the earth, with which we are more familiar. These planets\r\nwould be invisible if they were not shining in borrowed light.\r\n\r\nJupiter has not advanced so far as the earth. The specific gravity\r\nof Jupiter is somewhat lower than that of the sun (1.27 against\r\n1.38), and, apart from the clouds in its atmosphere, this planet is\r\nprobably altogether in a gaseous condition, while the earth, with its\r\nmean density of 5.52, possesses a solid cold crust, enclosing its\r\nincandescent interior. This state of the earth corresponds to the last\r\nstage in the evolution of the stars.\r\n\r\nOf the streams of gaseous matter which are ejected when stars collide\r\nwith one another, the metallic vapors are rapidly condensed by cooling;\r\nonly helium and hydrogen will remain in the gaseous condition and\r\nform nebular masses about the central body. These nebulæ yield bright\r\nlights. Their luminosity is due to the negative particles which are\r\nsent to them by the radiation pressure of near stars, and especially by\r\nthe central bodies of the nebula.\r\n\r\nWith the new stars which have so far been observed, this pressure of\r\nradiation soon diminishes, and the nebular light likewise decreases\r\nin such cases. In other instances, as with the stars characterized by\r\nbright hydrogen and helium lines, the radiation of the central body or\r\nstars in their vicinity seems to be maintained at full force for long\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nThe nebulous accumulations of helium and hydrogen will gradually escape\r\nand be condensed in near-by stars under the formation of “explosive”\r\ncompounds. The tendency to enter into combination seems to be strongest\r\nin the case of helium; it disappears first from the stellar atmosphere.\r\nThat helium enters into compounds at high temperatures seems to follow\r\nfrom the researches of Ramsay, Cooke, and Kohlschütter.\r\n\r\nHydrogen will afterwards be absorbed, and the light of the central body\r\nwill then show the predominating occurrence of the vapors of calcium\r\nand of other metals in its atmosphere. Simultaneously with these,\r\nchemical compounds will be noticed, among which the carbon compounds\r\nwill play an important part—in the outer portions of the sun-spots, in\r\nthe stars of the Secchi Type IV., as well as in the gaseous envelopes\r\nof the comets.[18]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: The presence of carbon bands in the spectrum\r\n    need not be taken as a mark of low temperature. Crew and Hale\r\n    have observed that these bands gradually vanished from an arc\r\n    spectrum as the temperature was lowered by decreasing the\r\n    current intensity.]\r\n\r\nFinally a crust will form. The star is extinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII\r\n\r\n                   THE NEBULAR AND THE SOLAR STATES\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to a more intimate consideration of the chemical\r\nand physical conditions which probably characterize the nebulæ in\r\ndistinction from the suns. These properties differ in many respects\r\nessentially from those which we are accustomed to associate with matter\r\nas investigated by us, which may, from this point of view, be styled\r\nrelatively concentrated.\r\n\r\nThe differences must be fundamental. For the motto of Clausius, which\r\ncomprises the sum of our knowledge of the nature of heat, cannot apply\r\nto nebulæ. This motto reads:\r\n\r\n    “The energy of the universe is constant. The entropy of the\r\n    universe tends to a maximum.”\r\n\r\nEverybody understands what is meant by energy. We know energy in\r\nmany forms. The most important are: energy of position (a heavy body\r\nhas larger energy by virtue of its having been raised to a certain\r\nheight above the surface of the earth than when it is lying on the\r\nsurface); energy of motion (a discharged rifle-bullet has an energy\r\nwhich is proportional to the mass of the bullet and to the square of\r\nits velocity); energy of heat, which is regarded as the energy of the\r\nmotion of the smallest particles of a body; electrical energy, such as\r\ncan, for instance, be stored in an accumulator battery, and which,\r\nlike all other modifications of energy, may be converted into energy of\r\nheat; and chemical energy, such as is displayed by a mixture of eight\r\ngrammes of oxygen with one gramme of hydrogen, which can be transformed\r\ninto water under a strong evolution of heat. When we say that the\r\nenergy of a system to which energy is not imparted from outside is\r\nconstant, we merely mean that the different forms of energy of the\r\nseparate parts of this system may be transformed into other forms of\r\nenergy, but that the sum total of all the energies must always remain\r\nunchanged. According to Clausius this law is valid throughout the\r\ninfinite space of the universe.\r\n\r\nBy entropy we understand the quantity of heat of a body divided by its\r\nabsolute temperature. If a quantity of heat, of Q calories, of a body\r\nat a temperature of 100° (absolute temperature, 373°) passes over to\r\nanother body of 0° (absolute temperature, 273°), the total entropy of\r\nthe two will have been decreased by Q/373, and increased by Q/273. As\r\nthe latter quantity is the greater, the entropy of the whole will have\r\nincreased. By itself, we know, heat always passes, either by radiation\r\nor by conduction, from bodies of higher temperature to bodies of lower\r\ntemperature. That evidently implies an increase in entropy, and it is\r\nin agreement with the law of Clausius that entropy tends to increase.\r\n\r\nThe most simple case of heat equilibrium is that in which we place a\r\nnumber of bodies of unequal temperatures in an enclosure which neither\r\nreceives heat from outside nor communicates heat to the outside. In\r\nsome way or other, usually by conduction or radiation, the heat will\r\npass from the warmer to the colder bodies, until at last equilibrium\r\nensues and all the bodies have the same temperature. According to\r\nClausius, the universe tends to that thermal equilibrium. If it be\r\never attained, all sources of motion, and hence of light, will have\r\nbeen exhausted. The so-called “heat-death” (Wärmetod) will have come.\r\n\r\nIf Clausius were right, however, this heat-death, we may object, should\r\nalready have occurred in the infinitely long space of time that the\r\nuniverse has been in existence. Or we might argue that the world has\r\nnot yet been in existence sufficiently long, but that, anyhow, it had a\r\nbeginning. That would contradict the first part of the law of Clausius,\r\nthat the energy of the universe is constant; for in that case all the\r\nenergy would have originated in the moment of creation. That is quite\r\ninconceivable, and we must hence look for conditions for which the\r\nentropy law of Clausius does not hold.\r\n\r\nThe famous Scotch physicist Clerk-Maxwell has conceived of such a case.\r\nImagine a vessel which is divided by a partition into two halves, both\r\ncharged with a gas of perfectly uniform temperature. Let the partition\r\nbe provided with a number of small holes which would not allow more\r\nthan one gas molecule to pass at a time. In each hole Maxwell places a\r\nsmall, intelligent being (one of his “demons”), which directs all the\r\nmolecules which enter into the hole, and which have a greater velocity\r\nthan the mean velocity of all the molecules, to the one side, and which\r\nsends to the other side all the molecules of a smaller velocity than\r\nthe average.[19] All the undesirable molecules the demon bars by means\r\nof a little flap. In this way all the molecules of a velocity greater\r\nthan the average may be collected in the one compartment, and all the\r\nmolecules of a lesser velocity in the other compartment. In other\r\nwords, heat—for heat consists in the movements of molecules—will pass\r\nfrom the one constantly cooling side to the other, which is constantly\r\nraising its temperature, and which must therefore become warmer than\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 19: The kinetic theory of gases imagines all the\r\n    molecules of a gas to be in constant motion. The internal\r\n    pressure of the gas depends upon the mean velocity of the\r\n    particles; but some particles will move at a greater, and some\r\n    at a smaller velocity than the average.—H.B.]\r\n\r\nIn this instance heat would therefore pass from a colder to a warmer\r\nbody, and the entropy would diminish.\r\n\r\nNature, of course, does not know any such intelligent beings.\r\nNevertheless, similar conditions may occur in celestial bodies in\r\nthe gaseous state. When the molecules of gas in the atmosphere of a\r\ncelestial body have a sufficient velocity—which in the case of the\r\nearth would be 11 km. (7 miles) per second—and when they travel\r\noutward into the most extreme strata, they may pass from the range of\r\nattraction out into infinite space, after the manner of a comet, which,\r\nif endowed with sufficient velocity when near the sun, must escape\r\nfrom the solar system. According to Stoney, it is in this way that the\r\nmoon has lost its original atmosphere. This loss of gas is certainly\r\nimperceptible in the case of our sun and of large planets like the\r\nearth. But it may play an important part in the household of the\r\nnebulæ, where all the radiation from the hot celestial bodies is stored\r\nup, and where, owing to the enormous distances, the restraining force\r\nof gravity is exceedingly feeble. Thus the nebulæ will lose their most\r\nrapid molecules from their outer portions, and they will therefore be\r\ncooling in these outer strata. This loss of heat is compensated by the\r\nradiation from the stars. If, now, there were only nebulæ of one kind\r\nin the whole universe, those escaped molecules would finally land on\r\nsome other nebula, heat equilibrium would thus be established between\r\nthe different nebulæ, and the “heat-death” be realized. But we have\r\nalready remarked that the nebulæ enclose many immigrated celestial\r\nbodies, which are able to condense the gases from their neighborhood,\r\nand which thereby assume a higher temperature.\r\n\r\nThe lost molecules of gases may also stray into the vast atmosphere of\r\nthese growing stars, and the condensation will then be hastened under a\r\ncontinuous lowering of the entropy. By such processes the clock-work of\r\nthe universe may be maintained in motion without running down.\r\n\r\nAbout the bodies which have drifted into nebulæ, and about the remnants\r\nof new stars which lie inside the nebulæ, the gases will thus collect\r\nwhich had formerly been scattered through the outer portions of the\r\nnebula. These gases originate from the explosive compounds which had\r\nbeen stored in the interior of the new stars. Hydrogen and helium\r\nare, most likely, the most important of these; for they are the most\r\ndifficult to be condensed, and can exist in notable quantities at\r\nextremely low temperatures, such as must prevail in the outermost\r\nportions of the nebulæ, in which gases of other substances would be\r\nliquefied. Even if the nebulæ had an absolute temperature of 50° (-223°\r\nC.), the vapor of the most volatile of all the metals, mercury, would\r\neven in the saturated state be present in such a small quantity that\r\na single gramme would occupy the space of a cube whose side would\r\ncorrespond to about two thousand light-years—that is to say, to 450\r\ntimes the distance of the earth from the nearest fixed star. One gramme\r\nof sodium, likewise a very volatile metal, and of a comparatively high\r\nimportance in the constitution of the fixed stars, would fill the side\r\nof a cube that would be a thousand million times as large. Still more\r\ninconceivable numbers result for magnesium and iron, which are very\r\nfrequent constituents of fixed stars, and which are less volatile than\r\nthe just-mentioned metals. We thus recognize the strongly selective\r\naction of the low temperatures upon all the substances which are less\r\ndifficult to condense than helium and hydrogen. As we now know that\r\nthere is another substance in the nebulæ, which has been designated\r\nnebulium, and which is characterized by two spectral lines not found in\r\nany terrestrial substance, we must conclude that this otherwise unknown\r\nelement nebulium must be almost as difficult to condense as hydrogen\r\nand helium. Its boiling-point will probably lie below 50° absolute,\r\nlike that of those gases.\r\n\r\nThat hydrogen and helium, together with nebulium, alone seem to occur\r\nin the vastly extended nebulæ is probably to be ascribed to their\r\nlow boiling-points. We need not look for any other explanation. The\r\nsupposition of Lockyer that all the other elements would be transformed\r\ninto hydrogen and helium at extreme rarefaction is quite unsupported.\r\n\r\nIn somewhat lower strata of the nebula, where its shape resembles\r\na disk, other not easily condensable substances, such as nitrogen,\r\nhydrocarbons of simple composition, carbon monoxide, further, at deeper\r\nlevels, cyanogen and carbon dioxide, and, near the centre, sodium,\r\nmagnesium, and even iron may occur in the gaseous state. These less\r\nvolatile constituents may exist as dust in the outermost strata. This\r\ndust would not be revealed to us by the spectroscope. In the strongly\r\ndeveloped spiral nebulæ, however, the extreme layers, which seem\r\nto hide the central body, appear to be so attenuated that the dust\r\nfloating in them is not able to obscure the spectrum of the metallic\r\ngases. The spectrum of the nebula then resembles a star spectrum,\r\nbecause the deepest strata contain incandescent layers of dust clouds,\r\nwhose light is sifted by the surrounding masses of gases.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed that the lines of the different elements are\r\nnot uniformly distributed in the nebulæ. Thus Campbell observed,\r\nfor instance, when investigating a small planetary nebula in the\r\nneighborhood of the great Orion nebula, that the nebulium had not the\r\nsame distribution as the hydrogen. The nebulium, which was concentrated\r\nin the centre of the nebula, probably has a higher boiling-point than\r\nhydrogen, therefore, and occurs in noticeable quantities in the inner,\r\nhotter parts of the nebula. Systematic investigations of this kind may\r\nhelp us to a more perfect knowledge of the temperature relations in\r\nthese peculiar celestial objects.\r\n\r\nRitter and Lane have made some interesting calculations on the\r\nequilibrium in a gaseous celestial body of so low a density that the\r\nlaw of gases may be applied to it. That is only permissive for gases\r\nor for mixtures of gases whose density does not exceed one-tenth of\r\nthat of water or one-fourteenth of the actual density of the sun.\r\nThe pressure in the central portions of such a mass of gas would,\r\nof course, be greater than the pressure in the outer portions, just\r\nas the pressure rises as we penetrate from above downward into our\r\nterrestrial atmosphere. If we imagine a mass of the air of our\r\natmosphere transferred one thousand metres higher up, its volume will\r\nincrease and its temperature will fall by 9.8° C. (18° F.). If there\r\nwere extremely violent vertical convection currents in the air, its\r\ntemperature would diminish in this manner with increasing altitude; but\r\ninternal radiation tends to equalize these temperature differences.\r\nThe following calculation by Schuster concerning the conditions of a\r\nmass of gas of the size of the sun is based on Ritter’s investigation.\r\nIt has been made under the hypothesis that the thermal properties of\r\nthis mass of gas are influenced only by the movements in it, and not by\r\nradiation. The calculation is applied to a star which has the same mass\r\nas the sun (1.9 × 10^{33} grammes, or 324,000 times the mass of the\r\nearth), and a radius of about ten times that of the sun (10 × 690,000\r\nkm.), whose mean density would thus be 1000 times smaller than that of\r\nthe sun, or 0.0014 times the density of water at 4° C. In the following\r\ntable the first column gives the distance of a point from the centre\r\nof the star as a fraction of its radius; the density (second column)\r\nis expressed in the usual scale, water being the unit; pressures\r\nare stated in thousands of atmospheres, temperatures in thousands\r\nof degrees Centigrade. The temperature will vary proportionately\r\nto the molecular weight of the gas of which the star consists; the\r\ntemperatures, in the fourth column of the table, concern a gas of\r\nmolecular weight 1—that is to say, hydrogen gas dissociated into\r\natoms, as it will be undoubtedly on the sun and on the star. If the\r\nstar should consist of iron, we should have to multiply these latter\r\nnumbers by 56, the molecular weight of iron; the corresponding figures\r\nwill be found in the fifth column.\r\n\r\n                                                      Temperature in\r\n    Distance from    Density    Pressure in 10^3        10^3° Cent.\r\n       centre                     atmospheres       Hydrogen     Iron\r\n\r\n         0           0.00844         852              2460      137,500\r\n         0.1         0.00817         807              2406      134,600\r\n         0.2         0.00739         683              2251      126,100\r\n         0.3         0.00623         513              2007      112,400\r\n         0.4         0.00488         342              1707       95,600\r\n         0.5         0.00354         200              1377       77,100\r\n         0.6         0.00233         100              1043       58,400\r\n         0.7         0.00136          40               728       48,800\r\n         0.8         O.00065          12               445       24,900\r\n         0.9         0.00020           1.7             202       11,300\r\n         1.0         0.00000           0                 0            0\r\n\r\nSchuster’s calculation was really made for the sun—that is to say,\r\nfor a celestial body whose diameter is ten times smaller, and\r\nwhose specific gravity is therefore a thousand times greater than\r\nthe above-assumed values. According to the laws of gravitation and\r\nof gases, the pressure must there be 10,000 times greater, and the\r\ntemperature ten times higher, than those in our table. The density of\r\nthe interior portions would, however, become far too large to admit\r\nof the application of the gas laws. I have therefore modified the\r\ncalculations so as to render them applicable to a celestial body of ten\r\ntimes the radius of the sun or of 1080 times the radius of the earth;\r\nthe radius would then represent one-twenty-second of the distance\r\nfrom the centre of the sun to the earth’s orbit, and the respective\r\ncelestial body would have very small dimensions indeed if compared to a\r\nnebula.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinarily high pressure in the interior portions of the\r\ncelestial body is striking; this is due to the great mass and to the\r\nsmall distances. In the centre of the sun the pressure would amount to\r\n8520 million atmospheres, since the pressure increases inversely as the\r\nfourth power of the radius. The pressure near the centre of the sun is,\r\nindeed, almost of that order. If the sun were to expand to a spherical\r\nplanetary nebula of a thousand times its actual linear dimensions (when\r\nit would almost fill the orbit of Jupiter), the specific gravity at\r\nits centre would be diminished to one-millionth of the above-mentioned\r\nvalue—that is to say, matter in this nebula would not, even at the\r\npoint of greatest concentration, be any denser than in the highly\r\nrarefied vacuum tubes which we can prepare at ordinary temperatures.\r\nThe pressure would likewise be greatly diminished—namely, to about six\r\nmillimetres only, near the centre of the gaseous mass. The temperature,\r\nhowever, would be rather high near the centre—namely, 24,600° C., if\r\nthe nebula should consist of atomatic hydrogen, and fifty-six times\r\nas high again if consisting of iron gas. Such a nebula would restrain\r\ngases with 1.63 times the force which the earth exerts. Molecules of\r\ngases moving outward with a velocity of about 18 km. (11 miles) per\r\nsecond would forever depart from this atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe estimation of the temperature in such masses of gases is certainly\r\nsomewhat unreliable. We have to presume that neither radiation nor\r\nconduction exert any considerable influence. That might be permitted\r\nfor conduction; but we are hardly justified in neglecting radiation.\r\nThe temperatures within the interior of the nebula will, therefore, be\r\nlower than our calculated values. It is, however, difficult to make any\r\ndefinite allowance for this factor.\r\n\r\nIf the mass of the celestial body should not be as presumed—for\r\ninstance, twice as large—we should only have to alter the pressure and\r\nthe density of each layer in the same proportion, and thus to double\r\nthe above values. The temperature would remain unchanged. We are hence\r\nin a position to picture to ourselves the state of a nebula of whatever\r\ndimensions and mass.\r\n\r\nLane has proved, what the above calculations also indicate, that the\r\ntemperature of such nebula will rise when it contracts in consequence\r\nof its losing heat. If heat were introduced from outside, the nebula\r\nwould expand under cooling. A nebula of this kind presumably loses\r\nheat and gradually raises its own temperature until it has changed\r\ninto a star, which will at first have an atmosphere of helium and of\r\nhydrogen like that of the youngest stars (with white light). By-and-by,\r\nunder a further rise of temperature, the extremely energetic chemical\r\ncompounds will be formed which characterize the interior of the sun,\r\nbecause helium and hydrogen—which were liberated when the nebula was\r\nre-formed and which dashed out into space—will diffuse back into the\r\ninterior of the star, where they will be bound under the formation of\r\nthe compounds mentioned. The atmosphere of hydrogen and of helium will\r\ndisappear (helium first), the star will contract more and more, and the\r\npressure and the convection currents in the gases will become enormous.\r\nThere will be a strong formation of clouds in the atmosphere of the\r\nstar, which will gradually become endowed with the properties which\r\ncharacterize our sun. The sun behaves very differently from the gaseous\r\nnebulæ for which the calculations of Lane, Ritter, and Schuster hold.\r\nFor when the contraction of a gas shall have proceeded to a certain\r\nlimit, the pressure will increase in the ratio 1: 16, while the volume\r\nwill decrease in the ratio 8: 1, provided there be no change in the\r\ntemperature. When the gas has reached this point and is still further\r\ncompressed, the temperature will remain in steady equilibrium. At still\r\nhigher pressures, however, the temperature must fall if equilibrium\r\nis to be maintained. According to Amagat, this will occur at 17° C.\r\n(290° absolute) in gases like hydrogen and nitrogen, which at this\r\ntemperature are far above their critical points, and at a pressure of\r\n300 or 250 atmospheres. When the temperature is twice as high on the\r\nabsolute scale, or at 307° C., twice the pressure will be required.\r\n\r\nWe can now calculate when our nebula will pass through this critical\r\nstage, to which a lowering of the temperature must succeed. Accepting\r\nthe above figures, we find that half the mass of the nebula will fill\r\na sphere of a radius 0.53 of that of the nebula. If the mass were\r\neverywhere of the same density, half of it would fill a sphere of 0.84\r\nof this radius. When will the interior mass cross the boundary of the\r\nabove stage, while the exterior portions still remain below this stage?\r\nThat will be at about the time when the nebula in its totality will\r\npass through its maximum temperature. We will now base our calculations\r\non the temperatures which apply to iron in the gaseous state; for in\r\nthe interior of the nebula the mean molecular weight will at least be\r\n56 (that of iron). We shall find that the pressure at the distance 0.53\r\nwill be about 177,000 atmospheres, and the temperature approximately\r\n71 million degrees—_i.e._, 245,000 times higher than the absolute\r\ntemperature in the experiments of Amagat. The specified stage will\r\nthen be reached when the pressure will be 245,000 times as large as\r\n250 atmospheres—viz., 61 million atmospheres. As, now, the pressure\r\nis only 177,000 atmospheres, our nebula will yet be far removed from\r\nthat stage at which cooling will set in. We can easily calculate that\r\nthis will take place when the nebula has contracted to a volume about\r\nthree times that of our sun. The assertion which is so often made\r\nthat the sun might possibly attain higher temperatures in the future\r\nis unwarranted. This celestial body has long since passed through the\r\nculminating-point of its thermal evolution, and is now cooling. As the\r\ntemperatures which Schuster deduced were no doubt much too high, the\r\ncooling must, indeed, have set in already in an earlier stage. But\r\nstars like Sirius, whose density is probably not more than one per\r\ncent, of the solar density, are probably still in a rising-temperature\r\nstage. Their condition approximates that of the mass of gas of our\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nThe planetary nebulæ are vastly more voluminous. The immense space\r\nwhich these celestial bodies may occupy will be understood from the\r\nfact that the largest among them, No. 5 in Herschel’s catalogue,\r\nsituated near the star B in the Great Bear, has a diameter of 2.67\r\nseconds of arc. If it were as near to us as our nearest star neighbor,\r\nits diameter would yet be more than three times that of the orbit\r\nof Neptune; doubtless it is many hundreds of times larger. This\r\nconsideration furnishes us with an idea of the infinite attenuation\r\nin such structures. In their very densest portions the density cannot\r\nbe more than one-billionth of the density of the air. In the outer\r\nportions of such nebulæ the temperature must also be exceedingly low;\r\nelse the particles of the nebula could not be kept together, and only\r\nhydrogen and helium can occur in them in the gaseous state.\r\n\r\nYet we may regard the density and temperature of such celestial bodies\r\nas gigantic by comparison with those of the gases in the spirals of the\r\nnebulæ. There never is equilibrium in these spirals, and it is only\r\nbecause the forces in action are so extraordinarily small that these\r\nstructures can retain their shapes for long periods without noticeable\r\nchanges. It is, probably, chiefly in those parts in which the cosmical\r\ndust is stopped in its motion that meteorites and comets are produced.\r\nThe dust particles wander into the more central portions of the\r\nnebulæ, into which they penetrate deeply, owing to their relatively\r\nlarge mass, to form the nuclei for the growth of planets and moons. By\r\ntheir collisions with the masses of gases which they encounter, they\r\ngradually assume a circular movement about the axis of rotation of the\r\nnebula. In this rotation they condense portions of the gases on their\r\nsurface, and hence acquire a high temperature—which they soon lose\r\nagain, however, owing to the comparatively rapid radiation.\r\n\r\nSo far as we know, spiral nebulæ are characterized by continuous\r\nspectra. The splendor of the stars within them completely outshines the\r\nfeeble luminosity of the nebula. The stars in them are condensation\r\nproducts and undoubtedly in an early stage of their existence;\r\nthey may therefore be likened to the white stars, like the new star\r\nin Perseus and the central star in the ring nebula of the Lyre.\r\nNevertheless, it has been ascertained that the spectrum of the\r\nAndromeda nebula has about the same length as that of the yellow stars.\r\nThat may be due to the fact that the light of the stars in this nebula,\r\nwhich we only seem to see from the side, is partly extinguished by dust\r\nparticles in its outer portion, as was the case with the light of the\r\nnew star in Perseus during the period of its variability.\r\n\r\nOur considerations lead to the conclusion that there is rotating about\r\nthe central body of the nebula an immense mass of gas, and that outside\r\nthis mass there are other centres of condensation moving about the\r\ncentral body together with the masses of gas concentrated about them.\r\nOwing to the friction between the immigrated masses and the original\r\nmass of gas which circulated in the equatorial plane of the central\r\nbody, all these masses will keep near the equatorial plane, which will\r\ntherefore deviate little from the ecliptic. We thus obtain a proper\r\nplanetary system, in which the planets are surrounded by colossal\r\nspheres of gas like the stars in the Pleiades (Fig. 52). If, now, the\r\nplanets have very small mass by comparison with the central body—as\r\nin our solar system—they will be cooled at an infinitely faster rate\r\nthan the sun. The gaseous masses will soon shrink, and the periods of\r\nrotation will be shortened; but for those planets, at least, which are\r\nsituated near the centre, these periods will originally differ little\r\nfrom the rotation of the central body. The dimensions of the central\r\nbody will always be very large, and the planets circulating about it\r\nwill produce very strong tidal effects in its mass. Its period of\r\nrotation will be shortened, while the orbital rotation of the planets\r\nwill tend to become lengthened. Thus the equilibrium is disturbed;\r\nit is re-established again, because the planet is, so to say, lifted\r\naway from the sun, as G. H. Darwin has so ingeniously shown with\r\nregard to the moon and the earth. Similar relations will prevail in\r\nthe neighborhood of those planets which will thus become provided with\r\nmoons. Hence we understand the peculiar fact that all the planets move\r\nalmost in the same plane, the so-called ecliptic, and in approximately\r\ncircular orbits; that they all move in the same direction, and that\r\nthey have the same direction of rotation in common with their moons and\r\nwith the central body, the sun. It is only the outermost planets, like\r\nUranus and Neptune, in whose cases the tidal effects were not of much\r\nconsequence, that form exceptions to this rule.\r\n\r\nIn explanation of these phenomena various philosophers and astronomers\r\nhave advanced a theory which is known as the Kant-Laplace theory,\r\nafter its most eminent advocates. Suggestions pointing in the same\r\ndirection we find in Swedenborg (1734). Swedenborg assumed that our\r\nplanetary system had been evolved under the formation of vortices from\r\na kind of “chaos solare,” which had acquired a more and more energetic\r\ncirculating motion about the sun under the influence of internal\r\nforces, possibly akin to magnetic forces. Finally a ring had been\r\nthrown off from the equator, and had separated into fragments, out of\r\nwhich the planets had been formed.\r\n\r\nBuffon introduced gravitation as the conservational principle. In an\r\ningenious essay, “Formation des Planètes” (1745), he suggests that\r\nthe planets may have been formed from a “stream” of matter which was\r\nejected by the sun when a comet rushed into it.\r\n\r\nKant started from an original chaos of stationary dust, which under\r\nthe influence of gravitation arranged itself as a central body, with\r\nrings of dust turning around it; the rings, later on, formed themselves\r\ninto planets. The laws of mechanics teach, however, that no rotation\r\ncan be set up in a central body, which is originally stationary, by\r\nthe influence of a central force like gravitation. Laplace, therefore,\r\nassumed with Swedenborg that the primeval nebula from which our\r\nsolar system was evolved had been rotating about the central axis.\r\nAccording to Laplace, rings like those of Saturn would split off, as\r\nsuch a system contracted, and planets and their moons and rings would\r\nafterwards be formed out of those rings. It is generally believed at\r\npresent, however, that only meteorites and small planets, but not the\r\nlarger planets, could have originated in this way. We have, indeed,\r\nsuch rings of dust rotating about Saturn, the innermost more rapidly,\r\nthe outer rings more slowly, just as they would if they were crowds of\r\nlittle moons.\r\n\r\nMany further objections have later been raised against the hypothesis\r\nof Laplace, first by Babinet, later especially by Moulton and\r\nChamberlin. In its original shape this hypothesis would certainly not\r\nappear to be tenable. I have therefore replaced it by the evolution\r\nthesis outlined above. It is rather striking that the moons of the\r\noutermost planets, Neptune and Uranus, do not move in the plane of\r\nthe ecliptic, and that their moons further describe a “retrograde”\r\nmovement—that is to say, they move in the direction opposite to that\r\nconforming to the theory of Laplace. The same seems to hold for the\r\nmoon of Saturn, which was discovered in 1898 by Pickering. All these\r\nfacts were, of course, unknown to Laplace in 1776; and if he had known\r\nthem he would scarcely have advanced his thesis in the garb in which\r\nhe offered it. The explanation of these facts does not cause any\r\ndifficulty. We may assume that the matter in the outer portions of\r\nthe primeval nebula was so strongly attenuated that the immigrating\r\nplanet did not attain a sufficient volume to have the large common\r\nrotation in the equatorial plane of the sun impressed upon it by the\r\ntidal effects. Charged only with the small mass of matter which they\r\nmet on their road, the planet and its moon, on the contrary, remained\r\nvictorious in the limited districts in which they were rotating. Only\r\nthe slow orbital movement about the central body was influenced, and\r\nthat adapted itself to the common direction and the circular orbit. It\r\nis not inconceivable that there may be, farther out in space, planets\r\nof our solar system, unknown to us, moving in irregular paths like the\r\ncomets. The comets, Laplace assumed, probably immigrated at a later\r\nperiod into our solar system when the condensation had already advanced\r\nso far that the chief mass of the nebular matter had disappeared from\r\ninterplanetary space.\r\n\r\nChamberlin and Moulton have attempted to show that the difficulties\r\nof the hypothesis of Laplace may be obviated by the assumption that\r\nthe solar system has evolved from a spiral nebula, into which strange\r\nbodies intruded which condensed the nebular mass of their surroundings\r\nupon themselves. We have pointed out examples of how the nebula seems\r\nto vanish in the vicinity of the stars, which would correspond to\r\ngrowing planets, located in nebulæ.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this consideration, we may draw a comparison between the\r\nviews which were still entertained a short time ago and the views and\r\nprospects which the discoveries of modern days open to our eyes.\r\n\r\nUp to the beginning of this century the gravitation of Newton seemed\r\nto rule supreme over the motions and over the development of the\r\nmaterial universe. By virtue of this gravitation the celestial bodies\r\nshould tend to draw together, to unite in ever-growing masses. In the\r\ninfinite space of past time the evolution should have proceeded so far\r\nthat some large suns, bright or extinct, could alone persist. All life\r\nwould be impossible under such conditions.\r\n\r\nAnd yet we discern in the neighborhood of the sun quite a number\r\nof dark bodies, our planets, and we may surmise that similar dark\r\ncompanions or satellites exist in the vicinity of other suns and stars;\r\nfor we could not understand the peculiar to-and-fro motions of those\r\nstars on any other view. We further observe that quite a number of\r\nsmall celestial bodies rush through space in the shapes of meteorites\r\nor shooting-stars which must have come to us from the most remote\r\nportions of the universe.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of these apparent deviations from what we may regard\r\nas a necessary consequence of the exclusive action of gravity will\r\nbe found under two heads—in the action of the mechanical radiation\r\npressure of light, and in the collisions between celestial bodies. The\r\nlatter produce enormous vortices of gases about nebular structures in\r\nthe gaseous condition; the radiation pressure carries cosmical dust\r\ninto the vortices, and the dust collects into meteorites and comets and\r\nforms, together with the condensation products of the gaseous envelope,\r\nthe planets and the moons accompanying them.\r\n\r\nThe scattering influence of the radiation pressure therefore balances\r\nthe tendency of gravitation to concentrate matter. The vortices of\r\ngases in the nebulæ only serve to fix the position of the dust, which\r\nis ejected from the suns through the action of the radiation pressure.\r\n\r\nThe masses of gas within the nebulæ form the most important centres of\r\nconcentration of the dust which is ejected from the sun and stars.\r\nIf the world were limited, as people used to fancy—that is to say,\r\nif the stars were crowded together in a huge heap, and only infinite,\r\nempty space outside of this heap, the dust particles ejected from the\r\nsuns during past ages by the action of the radiating pressure would\r\nhave been lost in infinite space, just as we imagined that the radiated\r\nenergy of the sun was lost.\r\n\r\nIf that were so, the development of the universe would long since\r\nhave come to an end, to an annihilation of all matter and of all\r\nenergy. Herbert Spencer, among others, has explained how thoroughly\r\nunsatisfactory this view is. There must be cycles in the evolution of\r\nthe universe, he has emphasized. That is manifestly indispensable if\r\nthe system is to last. In the more rarefied, gaseous, cold portions of\r\nthe nebulæ we find that part of the machinery of the universe which\r\nchecks the waste of matter and, still more, the waste of force from\r\nthe suns. The immigrating dust particles have absorbed the radiation\r\nof the sun and impart their heat to the separate particles of the\r\ngases with which they collide. The total mass of gas expands, owing to\r\nthis absorption of heat, and cools in consequence. The most energetic\r\nmolecules travel away, and are replaced by new particles coming from\r\nthe inner portions of the nebulæ, which are in their turn cooled by\r\nexpansion. Thus every ray emitted by a sun is absorbed, and its energy\r\nis transferred, through the gaseous particles of the nebulæ, to suns\r\nthat are being formed and which are in the neighborhood of the nebula\r\nor in its interior portions. The heat is hence concentrated about\r\ncentres of attraction that have drifted into the nebula or about the\r\nremnants of the celestial bodies which once collided there. Thanks to\r\nthe low temperature of the nebula, the matter can again accumulate,\r\nwhile the radiation pressure, as Poynting has shown, will suffice\r\nto keep bodies apart if their temperature is 15° C., their diameter\r\n3.4 cm., and their specific gravity as large as that of the earth,\r\n5.5. At the distance of the orbit of Neptune, where the temperature\r\nis about 50° absolute and approximates, therefore, that of a nebula,\r\nthis limit of size is reduced to nearly one millimetre. It has already\r\nbeen suggested (compare page 153) that capillary forces, which would\r\nprevail under the co-operation of the gases condensed upon the dust\r\ngrains, rather than gravity, play a chief part in the accumulation\r\nand coalescence of the small particles. In the same manner as matter\r\nis concentrated about centres of attraction energy may be accumulated\r\nthere in contradiction to the law of the constant increase of entropy.\r\n\r\nDuring this conservational activity the layers of gas are rapidly\r\nrarefied, to be replaced by new masses from the inner parts of the\r\nnebula, until this centre is depleted, and the nebula has been\r\nconverted into a star cluster or a planetary system which circulates\r\nabout one or several suns. When the suns collide once more new nebulæ\r\nare created.\r\n\r\nThe explosive substances, consisting probably of hydrogen and helium\r\n(and possibly of nebulium), in combination with carbon and metals, play\r\na chief part in the evolution from the nebular to the stellar state,\r\nand in the formation of new nebulæ after collisions between two dark\r\nor bright celestial bodies. The chief laws of thermodynamics lead to\r\nthe assumption that these explosive substances are formed during the\r\nevolution of the suns and are destroyed during their collisions. The\r\nenormous stores of energy concentrated in these bodies perform, in a\r\ncertain sense, the duty of powerfully acting fly-wheels interposed in\r\nthe machinery of the universe in order to regulate its movements and\r\nto make certain that the cyclic transition from the nebular to the\r\nstar stage, and vice versa, will occur in a regular rhythm during the\r\nimmeasurable epochs which we must concede for the evolution of the\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of this compensating co-operation of gravity and of the\r\nradiation pressure of light, as well as of temperature equalization\r\nand heat concentration, the evolution of the world can continue in an\r\neternal cycle, in which there is neither beginning nor end, and in\r\nwhich life may exist and continue forever and undiminished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VIII\r\n\r\n              THE SPREADING OF LIFE THROUGH THE UNIVERSE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have just recognized the probability of the assumption that solar\r\nsystems have been evolved from nebulæ, and that nebulæ are produced\r\nby the collision of suns. We likewise consider it probable that there\r\ncirculate about the newly formed suns smaller celestial bodies which\r\ncool more rapidly than the central sun. When these satellites have\r\nprovided themselves with a solid crust, which will partly be covered\r\nby water, they may, under favorable conditions, harbor organic life,\r\nas the earth and probably also Venus and Mars do. The satellites would\r\nthereby gain a greater interest for us than if we had to imagine them\r\nas consisting entirely of lifeless matter.\r\n\r\nThe question naturally arises whether we may believe that life can\r\nreally originate on a celestial body as soon as circumstances are\r\nfavorable for its evolution and propagation. This question will occupy\r\nus in this last chapter.\r\n\r\nMen have been pondering over these problems since the remotest ages.\r\nAll living beings, past ages recognized, must have been generated and\r\nthey had to die after a certain shorter or longer life. Somewhat later,\r\nand yet still in a very early epoch, experience must have taught men\r\nthat organisms of one kind can only generate other organisms of the\r\nsame kind; that the species are invariable, as we now express it. The\r\nidea was that all species originally came from the hands of the Creator\r\nendowed with their present qualities. This view may still be said to\r\nrepresent the general or “orthodox” doctrine.\r\n\r\nThis view has also been called the Linnæan thesis, because Linné, in\r\nthe fifth edition of his _Genera Plantarum_, adheres to it strictly:\r\n“Species tot sunt, quot diversas formas ab initio produxit Infinitum\r\nEns, quae deinde formae secundum generationis inditas leges produxere\r\nplures, at sibi semper similes, ut species nunc nobis non sint plures\r\nquam fuerunt ab initio.” Which we may render: “There are as many\r\ndifferent kind of species as the Infinite Being has created different\r\nforms in the beginning. These forms have later engendered other beings\r\naccording to the laws of inheritance, always resembling them, so that\r\nwe have at the present time not any more species than there were from\r\nthe beginning.” Time was ripe, however, even then for a less rigid\r\nconception of nature, more in accordance with our present views. The\r\nfirst foundations of the theory of evolution in the biological sciences\r\nwere laid by Lamarck (in 1794), Treviranus (in 1809), Goethe and Oken\r\n(in 1820). But a reaction set in. Cuvier and his authority forced\r\npublic opinion back to the ancient stand-point. In his view the now\r\nextinct species of past geological epochs had been destroyed by natural\r\nrevolutions, and new species had again been generated by a new act of\r\nthe Creator.\r\n\r\nWithin the last few decades, however, the general belief has rapidly\r\nbeen revolutionized, and the theory of evolution, especially since the\r\nimmortal Charles Darwin came forth with his epoch-making researches,\r\nnow meets with universal acceptance.\r\n\r\nAccording to this theory the species adapt themselves in the course of\r\ntime to their surroundings, and the changes may become so great that a\r\nnew species may be considered to have originated from an old species.\r\nThe researches of De Vries have, within quite recent times, further\r\naccentuated this view, so that we now concede cases to be extant where\r\nnew species spring forth from old ones under our very eyes. This thesis\r\nhas become known as the theory of mutation.\r\n\r\nAt the present time we accordingly imagine that living organisms,\r\nsuch as we see around us, have all descended from older organisms,\r\nrather unlike them, of which we still find traces and remnants in the\r\ngeological strata which have been deposited during past ages. From this\r\nstand-point all living organisms might possibly have originated from\r\none single, most simple organism. How that was generated still remains\r\nto be explained.\r\n\r\nThe common view, to which the ancients inclined, is that the lower\r\norganisms need not necessarily have originated from seeds. It was\r\nnoticed that some low-type organisms, larvæ, etc., took rise in putrid\r\nmeat; Vergil describes this in his _Georgicas_. It was not until the\r\nseventeenth century that this belief was disproved by many experiments,\r\namong others by those of Swammerdam and Leuwenhoek. The thesis of the\r\nso-called “Generatio spontanea” once more blossomed into new life upon\r\nthe discovery of the so-called infusoria, the small animal organisms\r\nwhich seem to arise spontaneously in infusions and concoctions.\r\nSpallanzani, however, demonstrated in 1777 that when the infusions, and\r\nthe vessel containing them, as well as the air above them, were heated\r\nto a sufficiently high temperature to kill all the germs present, the\r\ninfusions would remain sterile, and no living organisms could develop\r\nin them. To this fact we owe our ordinary methods of making preserves.\r\nIt is true that objections were raised against this demonstration.\r\nThe air, it was objected, is so changed by heating that subsequent\r\ndevelopment of minute organisms is rendered impossible. But this last\r\nobjection was refuted by the chemists Chevreul and Pasteur, as well\r\nas by the physicist Tyndall in the sixties and seventies of the past\r\ncentury. These scientists demonstrated that no organisms are produced\r\nin air which is freed from the smallest germs by some other means than\r\nheating—_i.e._, by filtration through cotton-wool. The researches of\r\nPasteur, in particular, and the methods of sterilization which are\r\nbased upon them and which are applied every day in bacteriological\r\nlaboratories, have more and more forced the conviction upon us that a\r\ngerm is indispensable for the origination of life.\r\n\r\nAnd yet eminent scientists take up the pen again and again in order to\r\ndemonstrate the possibility of the “Generatio spontanea.” In this they\r\ndo not rely upon the safe methods of natural science, but they proceed\r\non philosophical lines of argument. Life, they suggest, must once have\r\nhad a beginning, and we are hence forced to believe that spontaneous\r\ngeneration, even if not realizable under actual conditions, must have\r\nonce occurred. Considerable interest was excited when the great English\r\nphysiologist Huxley believed he had discovered in the mud brought\r\nup from the very bottom of the sea an albuminoid substance which he\r\ncalled “Bathybius Haeckelii,” in honor of the zealous German Darwinist\r\nHaeckel. In this bathybius (deep-sea organism) one fancied for a time\r\nthat the primordial ooze, which had originated from inorganic matter\r\nand from which all organisms might have been evolved, and of which Oken\r\nhad been dreaming, had been discovered. But the more exact researches\r\nof the chemist Buchanan demonstrated that the albuminoid substance in\r\nthis primordial ooze consisted of flocks of gypsum precipitated by\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\nPeople then had recourse to the most fantastic speculations. Life, it\r\nwas argued, might possibly have had its origin in the incandescent mass\r\nof the interior of the earth. At high temperatures organic compounds\r\nof cyanogen and its derivatives might be formed which would be the\r\ncarriers of life (Pflüger). There is, however, little need of our\r\nentering into any of these speculations until they have been provided\r\nwith an experimental basis.\r\n\r\nAlmost every year the statement is repeated in biological literature\r\nthat we have at last succeeded in producing life from dead matter.\r\nAmong the most recent assertions of this kind, the discovery claimed\r\nby Butler-Burke has provoked much comment. He asserted that he had\r\nsucceeded, with the aid of the marvellous substance radium, in\r\ninstilling life into lifeless matter—namely, a solution of gelatine.\r\nCriticism has, however, relegated this statement, like all similar\r\nones, to the realm of fairy tales.\r\n\r\nWe fully share the opinion which the great natural philosopher\r\nLord Kelvin has expressed in the following words: “A very ancient\r\nspeculation, still clung to by many naturalists (so much so that I have\r\na choice of modern terms to quote in expressing it), supposes that,\r\nunder meteorological conditions very different from the present, dead\r\nmatter may have run together or crystallized or fermented into ‘germs\r\nof life,’ or ‘organic cells,’ or ‘protoplasm.’ But science brings a\r\nvast mass of inductive evidence against this hypothesis of spontaneous\r\ngeneration. Dead matter cannot become living without coming under the\r\ninfluence of matter previously alive. This seems to me as sure a\r\nteaching of science as the law of gravitation.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the latter verdict may be a little dogmatic, it yet\r\ndemonstrates how strongly many scientists feel the necessity of\r\nfinding another way of solving the problem. The so-called theory of\r\npanspermia really shows a way. According to this theory life-giving\r\nseeds are drifting about in space. They encounter the planets, and fill\r\ntheir surfaces with life as soon as the necessary conditions for the\r\nexistence of organic beings are established.\r\n\r\nThis view was probably foreshadowed long ago. Definite suggestions in\r\nthis direction we find in the writings of the Frenchman Sales-Guyon de\r\nMontlivault (1821), who assumed that seeds from the moon had awakened\r\nthe first life on the surface of the earth. The German physician H. E.\r\nRichter attempted to supplement the doctrine of Darwin by combining the\r\nconception of panspermia with it. Flammarion’s book on the plurality\r\nof inhabited worlds suggested to Richter the idea that seeds had come\r\nfrom some other inhabited world to our earth. He emphasizes the fact\r\nthat carbon has been found in meteorites which move in orbits similar\r\nto those of the comets which wander about in space; and in this carbon\r\nhe sees the rests of organic life. There is no proof at all for this\r\nlatter opinion. The carbon found in meteorites has never exhibited any\r\ntrace of organic structure, and we may well imagine the carbon—_e.g._,\r\nthat which appears to occur in the sun—to be of inorganic origin.\r\nStill more fantastic is his idea that organisms floating high in our\r\natmosphere are caught by the attraction of meteorites flying past\r\nour planet, and are in this way carried out into universal space and\r\ndeposited upon other celestial bodies. As the surface of meteorites\r\nbecomes incandescent in their flight through the atmosphere, any germs\r\nwhich they might possibly have caught would be destroyed; and if, in\r\nspite of that, a meteorite should become the conveyor of live germs,\r\nthose germs would be burned in the atmosphere of the planet on which\r\nthey descended.\r\n\r\nIn one point, however, we must agree with Richter. There is logic\r\nin his statement that “The infinite space is filled with, or (more\r\ncorrectly) contains, growing, mature, and dying celestial bodies. By\r\nmature worlds we understand those which are capable of sustaining\r\norganic life. We regard the existence of organic life in the universe\r\nas eternal. Life has always been there; it has always propagated itself\r\nin the shape of living organisms, from cells and from individuals\r\ncomposed of cells.” Man used to speculate on the origin of matter, but\r\ngave that up when experience taught him that matter is indestructible\r\nand can only be transformed. For similar reasons we never inquire into\r\nthe origin of the energy of motion. And we may become accustomed to the\r\nidea that life is eternal, and hence that it is useless to inquire into\r\nits origin.\r\n\r\nThe ideas of Richter were taken up again in a popular lecture delivered\r\nin 1872 by the famous botanist Ferdinand Cohn. The best-known\r\nexpression of opinion on the subject, however, is that of Sir William\r\nThomson (later Lord Kelvin) in his presidential address to the British\r\nAssociation at Edinburgh in 1871:\r\n\r\n“When two great masses come into collision in space, it is certain\r\nthat a large part of each is melted; but it seems also quite certain\r\nthat in many cases a large quantity of débris must be shot forth in\r\nall directions, much of which may have experienced no greater violence\r\nthan individual pieces of rock experience in a landslip or in blasting\r\nby gunpowder. Should the time when this earth comes into collision\r\nwith another body, comparable in dimensions to itself, be when it is\r\nstill clothed as at present with vegetation, many great and small\r\nfragments carrying seed and living plants and animals would undoubtedly\r\nbe scattered through space. Hence, and because we all confidently\r\nbelieve that there are at present, and have been from time immemorial,\r\nmany worlds of life besides our own, we must regard it as probable\r\nin the highest degree that there are countless seed-bearing meteoric\r\nstones moving about through space. If at the present instant no life\r\nexisted upon this earth, one such stone falling upon it might, by what\r\nwe blindly call _natural_ causes, lead to its becoming covered with\r\nvegetation. I am fully conscious of the many objections which may be\r\nurged against this hypothesis. I will not tax your patience further by\r\ndiscussing any of them on the present occasion. All I maintain is that\r\nI believe them to be all answerable.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we cannot share Lord Kelvin’s optimism regarding this\r\npoint. It is, in the first instance, questionable whether living beings\r\nwould be able to survive the violent impact of the collision of two\r\nworlds. We know, further, that the meteorite in its fall towards the\r\nearth becomes incandescent all over its surface, and any seeds on it\r\nwould therefore be deprived of their germinating power. Meteorites,\r\nmoreover, show quite a different composition from that of the fragments\r\nfrom the surface of the earth or a similar planet. Plants develop\r\nalmost exclusively in loose soil, and a lump of earth falling through\r\nour atmosphere would, no doubt, be disintegrated into a shower of small\r\nparticles by the resistance of the atmosphere. Each of these particles\r\nwould by itself flash up like a shooting-star, and could not reach the\r\nearth in any other shape than that of burned dust. Another difficulty\r\nis that such collisions, which, as we presume, are responsible for the\r\nflashing-up of so-called new stars, are rather rare phenomena, so that\r\nlittle likelihood remains of small seeds being transported to our earth\r\nin this manner.\r\n\r\nThe question has, however, entered into a far more favorable stage\r\nsince the effects of radiation have become understood.\r\n\r\nBodies which, according to the deductions of Schwarzschild, would\r\nundergo the strongest influence of solar radiation must have a diameter\r\nof 0.00016 mm., supposing them to be spherical. The first question is,\r\ntherefore: are there any living seeds of such extraordinary minuteness?\r\nThe reply of the botanist is that the so-called permanent spores of\r\nmany bacteria have a size of 0.0003 or 0.0002 mm., and there are, no\r\ndoubt, much smaller germs which our microscopes fail to disclose. Thus,\r\nyellow-fever in man, rabies in dogs, the foot-and-mouth disease in\r\ncattle, and the so-called mosaic disease—common to the tobacco plant\r\nin Netherlandish India, and also observed in other countries—are, no\r\ndoubt, parasitical diseases; but the respective parasites have not yet\r\nbeen discovered, presumably because they are too minute to be visible\r\nunder the microscope.[20]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 20: Meanwhile a large number of organisms which are\r\n    invisible under the ordinary microscope have been rendered\r\n    visible by the aid of the ultra-microscope, among others the\r\n    presumable microbe of the foot-and-mouth disease.]\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, very probable that there are organisms so small\r\nthat the radiation pressure of a sun would push them out into space,\r\nwhere they might give rise to life on planets, provided they met with\r\nfavorable conditions for their development.\r\n\r\nWe will, in the first instance, make a rough calculation of what would\r\nhappen if such an organism were detached from the earth and pushed out\r\ninto space by the radiation pressure of our sun. The organism would,\r\nfirst of all, have to cross the orbit of Mars; then the orbits of the\r\nsmaller and of the outer planets; and, having passed the last station\r\nof our solar system, the orbit of Neptune, it would drift farther into\r\ninfinite space towards other solar systems. It is not so difficult to\r\nestimate the time which the smallest particles would require for this\r\njourney. Let their specific gravity be that of water, which will very\r\nfairly correspond to the facts. The organisms would cross the orbit of\r\nMars after twenty days, the Jupiter orbit after eighty days, and the\r\norbit of Neptune after fourteen months. Our nearest solar system, Alpha\r\nCentauri, would be reached in nine thousand years. These calculations\r\nhave been made under the supposition that the radiation pressure is\r\nfour times as strong as gravitation, which would be nearly correct\r\naccording to the figures of Schwarzschild.[21]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 21: The radiation pressure has here been assumed to\r\n    be somewhat greater than on page 103, because the spores are\r\n    here regarded as opaque, while the drops of hydrocarbons have\r\n    been regarded as partially translucid to luminous rays.]\r\n\r\nThese time intervals required for the organisms to reach the different\r\nplanets of our solar system are not too long for the germs in question\r\nto preserve their germinating power. The estimate is more unfavorable\r\nin the case of their transference from one planetary system to another,\r\nwhich will require thousands of years. But we shall see further on that\r\nthe very low temperature of those parts of space (about -220° C.) would\r\nsuspend the extinction of the germinating power, as it arrests all\r\nchemical reactions.\r\n\r\nAs regards the period during which the germinating power can be\r\npreserved at ordinary temperature, we have been told that the so-called\r\n“mummy wheat” which had been found in ancient Egyptian tombs was still\r\ncapable of germination. Critics, however, have established that the\r\nrespective statements of the Arabs concerning the sources of that wheat\r\nare very doubtful. The French scientist Baudoin asserts that bacteria\r\ncapable of germination were found in a Roman tomb which had certainly\r\nremained untouched for eighteen hundred years; but this statement is to\r\nbe received with caution. It is certain, however, that both seeds of\r\nsome higher plants and spores of certain bacteria—_e.g._, anthrax—do\r\nmaintain their germinating power for several years (say, twenty), and\r\nthus for periods which are much longer than those we have estimated as\r\nnecessary for their transference to our planet.\r\n\r\nOn the road from the earth the germs would for about a month be exposed\r\nto the powerful light of the sun, and it has been demonstrated that\r\nthe most highly refrangible rays of the sun can kill bacteria and\r\ntheir spores in relatively short periods. As a rule, however, these\r\nexperiments have been conducted in such a manner that the spores could\r\ngerminate on the moist surface on which they were deposited (for\r\ninstance, in Marshall Ward’s experiments). That, however, does not at\r\nall conform to the conditions prevailing in planetary space. For Roux\r\nhas shown that anthrax spores, which are readily killed by light when\r\nthe air has access, remain alive when the air is excluded. Some spores\r\ndo not suffer from insulation at all. That applies, for instance,\r\naccording to Duclaux, to _Thyrothrix scaber_, which occurs in milk and\r\nwhich may live for a full month under the intense light of the sun. All\r\nthe botanists that I have been able to consult are of the opinion that\r\nwe can by no means assert with certainty that spores would be killed\r\nby the light rays in wandering through infinite space.\r\n\r\nIt may further be argued that the spores, in their journey through\r\nuniversal space, would be exposed during most of that period to an\r\nextreme cold which possibly they might not be able to endure. When the\r\nspores have passed the orbit of Neptune, their temperature will have\r\nsunk to -220°, and farther out it will sink still lower. In recent years\r\nexperiments have been made in the Jenner Institute, in London, with\r\nspores of bacteria which were kept for twenty hours at a temperature\r\nof -252° in liquid hydrogen. Their germinating power was not destroyed\r\nthereby.\r\n\r\nProfessor Macfadyen has, indeed, gone still further. He has\r\ndemonstrated that micro-organisms may be kept in liquid air (at -200°)\r\nfor six months without being deprived of their germinating power.\r\nAccording to what I was told on the occasion of my last visit to\r\nLondon, further experiments, continued for still longer periods, have\r\nonly confirmed this observation.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing improbable in the idea that the germinating power\r\nshould be preserved at lower temperatures for longer periods than at\r\nour ordinary temperatures. The loss of germinating power is no doubt\r\ndue to some chemical process, and all chemical processes proceed at\r\nslower rates at lower temperatures than they do at higher. The vital\r\nfunctions are intensified in the ratio of 1: 2.5 when the temperature\r\nis raised by 10° C. (18° F.). By the time that the spores reached the\r\norbit of Neptune and their temperature had been lowered to -220°, their\r\nvital energy would, according to this ratio, react with one thousand\r\nmillions less intensity than at 10°. The germinating power of the\r\nspores would hence, at -220°, during the period of three million years,\r\nnot be diminished to any greater degree than during one day at 10°.\r\nIt is, therefore, not at all unreasonable to assert that the intense\r\ncold of space will act like a most effective preservative upon the\r\nseeds, and that they will in consequence be able to endure much longer\r\njourneys than we could assume if we judged from their behavior at\r\nordinary temperatures.\r\n\r\nIt is similar with the drying effect which may be so injurious to plant\r\nlife. In interplanetary space, which is devoid of atmosphere, absolute\r\ndryness prevails. An investigation by B. Schröber demonstrates that the\r\ngreen alga _Pleurococcus vulgaris_, which is so common on the trunks\r\nof trees, can be kept in absolute dryness (over concentrated sulphuric\r\nacid in a desiccator) for twenty weeks without being killed. Seeds and\r\nspores may last still longer in a dry atmosphere.\r\n\r\nNow, the tension of water vapor decreases in nearly the same ratio as\r\nthe speed of the reaction with lower temperatures. The evaporation of\r\nwater—_i.e._, the drying effect—may hence, at a temperature of -220°,\r\nnot proceed further in three million years than it will in one day at\r\n10°. We have thus several plausible reasons for concluding that spores\r\nwhich oppose an effective resistance to drying may well be carried from\r\none planet to another and from one planetary system to another without\r\nsacrificing their vital energy.\r\n\r\nThe destructive effect of light is, according to the experiments of\r\nRoux, no doubt due to the fact that the rays of light call forth\r\nan oxidation by the intermediation of the surrounding air. This\r\npossibility is excluded in interplanetary space. Moreover, the\r\nradiation of the sun is nine hundred times fainter in the orbit\r\nof Neptune than in the orbit of the earth, and half-way to the\r\nnearest fixed star, Alpha Centauri, twenty million times feebler.\r\nLight, therefore, will not do much harm to the spores during their\r\ntransference.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, spores of the most minute organisms could escape from\r\nthe earth, they might travel in all directions, and the whole universe\r\nmight, so to say, be sown with them. But now comes the question: how\r\ncan they escape from the earth against the effect of gravitation?\r\nCorpuscles of such small weight would naturally be carried away by any\r\naerial current. A small rain-drop, 1/50 mm. in diameter, falls, at\r\nordinary air pressure, about 4 cm. per second. We can calculate from\r\nthis observation that a bacteria spore 0.00016 mm. in diameter would\r\nonly fall 83 m. in the course of a year. It is obvious that particles\r\nof this minuteness would be swept away by every air current they met\r\nuntil they reached the most diluted air of the highest strata. An air\r\ncurrent of a velocity of 2 m. per second would take them to a height\r\nwhere the air pressure is only 0.001 mm.—_i.e._, to a height of about\r\n100 km. (60 miles). But the air currents can never push the particle\r\noutside of our atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn order to raise the spores to still higher levels we must have\r\nrecourse to other forces, and we know that electrical forces can help\r\nus out of almost any difficulty. At heights of 100 km. the phenomena\r\nof the radiating aurora take place. We believe that the auroræ are\r\nproduced by the discharge of large quantities of negatively charged\r\ndust coming from the sun. If, therefore, the spore in question should\r\ntake up negative electricity from the solar dust during an electric\r\ndischarge, it may be driven out into the sea of ether by the repulsive\r\ncharges of the other particles.\r\n\r\nWe suppose, now, that the electrical charges—like matter—cannot be\r\nsubdivided without limit. We must finally come to a minimum charge,\r\nand this charge has been calculated at about 3.5.10^{-10} electrostatic\r\nunits.\r\n\r\nWe can, without difficulty, calculate the intensity of an electric\r\nfield capable of urging the charged spore of 0.00016 mm. upward against\r\nthe force of gravity. The required field-strength is only 200 volts per\r\nmetre. Such fields are often observed on the surface of the earth with\r\na clear sky, and they are, indeed, almost normal. The electric field of\r\na region in which an auroral display takes place is probably much more\r\nintense, and would, without doubt, be of sufficient intensity to urge\r\nthe small electrically charged spores which convection currents had\r\ncarried up to these strata, farther out into space against the force of\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\nIt is thus probable that germs of the lowest organisms known to us are\r\ncontinually being carried away from the earth and the other planets\r\nupon which they exist. As seeds in general, so most of these spores,\r\nthus carried away, will no doubt meet death in the cold infinite space\r\nof the universe. Yet a small number of spores will fall on some other\r\nworld, and may there be able to spread life if the conditions be\r\nsuitable. In many cases conditions will not be suitable. Occasionally,\r\nhowever, the spores will fall on favorable soil. It may take one\r\nmillion or several millions of years from the age at which a planet\r\ncould possibly begin to sustain life to the time when the first seed\r\nfalls upon it and germinates, and when organic life is thus originated.\r\nThis period is of little significance in comparison with the time\r\nduring which life will afterwards flourish on the planet.\r\n\r\nThe germs which in this way escape from the planets on which their\r\nancestors had found abode, may either wander unobstructed through\r\nspace, or they may, as we have indicated, reach outer planets, or\r\nplanets moving about other suns, or they may meet with larger\r\nparticles of dust rushing towards the sun.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of the Zodiacal Light and that part of it which has been\r\ndesignated the counter-glow. This latter glow is regularly seen in the\r\ntropics and occasionally in that portion of our heavens which is just\r\nopposite the sun. Astronomers ascribe the counter-glow to streams of\r\nfine dust which are drawn towards the sun (compare page 147). Let us\r\nassume that a seed of the diameter of 0.00016 mm. strikes against a\r\ngrain of dust which is a thousand times as large (0.0016 mm. diameter),\r\nand attaches itself to its surface. This spore will be carried by the\r\ngrain of dust towards the sun; it will cross the orbits of the inner\r\nplanets, and it may descend in their atmospheres. Those grains of dust\r\ndo not, by any means, require very long spaces of time to pass from one\r\nplanetary orbit to another. If we assume that the spore starts with\r\nzero velocity near Neptune (in which case the seed might originate\r\nfrom the moon of Neptune; for Neptune itself, like Uranus, Saturn, and\r\nJupiter, is not yet sufficiently cooled to sustain life), the spore\r\nwould reach the orbit of Uranus in twenty-one years, and of Mercury in\r\ntwenty-nine years. With the same initial velocity such particles would\r\nbe twelve years in passing between the orbits of Uranus and Saturn,\r\nfour years between Saturn and Jupiter, two years between Jupiter and\r\nMars, eighty-four days between Mars and the earth, forty days between\r\nthe earth and Venus, and twenty-eight days between Venus and Mercury.\r\n\r\nWe see from these time estimates that the germs, together with the\r\ngrains of dust to which they have attached themselves, might move\r\ntowards the sun with much smaller velocity (from ten to twenty times\r\nsmaller) without our having to fear any loss of their germinating\r\npowers during the transit. In other words, if these seeds adhere to the\r\nparticles, ninety or ninety-five per cent. of whose weight is balanced\r\nby the radiation pressure, they may soon fall into the atmosphere of\r\nsome inner planet with the moderate velocity of a few kilometres per\r\nsecond. It is easy to calculate that if such a particle should, in\r\nfalling, be arrested in its motion after the first second, it would\r\nyet, thanks to the strong heat radiation from it, not be heated by more\r\nthan 100° Cent. (212° F.) above the temperature of its surroundings.\r\nSuch a temperature can be borne by the spores of bacteria without fatal\r\neffects for much more than one second. After the particles, together\r\nwith the seed adhering to them, have once been stopped, they will\r\nslowly descend, or will be carried down to the surface of the nearest\r\nplanet by descending convection currents.\r\n\r\nIn this way life would be transferred from one point of a planetary\r\nsystem, on which it had taken root, to other locations in the same\r\nplanetary system which favor the development of life.\r\n\r\nThe seeds not caught by such particles of dust may be taken over to\r\nother solar systems, and finally be stopped by the radiation pressure\r\nof their suns. They cannot penetrate any farther than to spots at\r\nwhich the radiation pressure is as strong as at their starting-points.\r\nConsequently, germs from the earth, which is five times as near the sun\r\nas Jupiter, could approach another sun within a fifth of the distance\r\nat which germs from Jupiter would be stopped.\r\n\r\nSomewhere near the suns, where the seeds are arrested by the radiation\r\npressure to be turned back into space, there will evidently be\r\naccumulations of these seeds. The planets which circulate around their\r\nsuns have therefore more chance of meeting them than if they were not\r\nin the vicinity of a sun. The germs will have lost the great velocity\r\nwith which they wandered from one solar system to another, and they\r\nwill not be heated so greatly in falling through the atmospheres of the\r\nplanets which they meet.\r\n\r\nThe seeds which are turned back into space when coming near a sun will\r\nthere perhaps meet with particles whose weight is somewhat greater than\r\nthe repelling power of the radiation pressure. They would, therefore,\r\nturn back to the suns. Like the germs, and for similar reasons, these\r\nparticles would consequently be concentrated about the sun. The small\r\nseeds have, therefore, a comparatively better chance of being arrested\r\nbefore their return to space by contact with such particles, and of\r\nbeing carried to the planets near that sun.\r\n\r\nIn this manner life may have been transplanted for eternal ages from\r\nsolar system to solar system and from planet to planet of the same\r\nsystem. But as among the billions of grains of pollen which the wind\r\ncarries away from a large tree—a fir-tree, for instance—only one\r\nmay on an average give birth to a new tree, thus of the billions, or\r\nperhaps trillions, of germs which the radiation pressure drives out\r\ninto space, only one may really bring life to a foreign planet on which\r\nlife had not yet arisen, and become the originator of living beings on\r\nthat planet.\r\n\r\nFinally, we perceive that, according to this version of the theory\r\nof panspermia, all organic beings in the whole universe should be\r\nrelated to one another, and should consist of cells which are built up\r\nof carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. The imagined existence of\r\nliving beings in other worlds in whose constitution carbon is supposed\r\nto be replaced by silicon or titanium must be relegated to the realm of\r\nimprobability. Life on other inhabited planets has probably developed\r\nalong lines which are closely related to those of our earth, and this\r\nimplies the conclusion that life must always recommence from its very\r\nlowest type, just as every individual, however highly developed it may\r\nbe, has by itself passed through all the stages of evolution from the\r\nsingle cell upward.\r\n\r\nAll these conclusions are in beautiful harmony with the general\r\nproperties characteristic of life on our earth. It cannot be denied\r\nthat this interpretation of the theory of panspermia is distinguished\r\nby perfect consistency, which is the most important criterion of the\r\nprobability of a cosmogonical theory.\r\n\r\nThere is little probability, though, of our ever being able to\r\ndemonstrate the correctness of this view by an examination of seeds\r\nfalling down upon our earth. For the number of germs which reach us\r\nfrom other worlds will be extremely limited—not more, perhaps, than a\r\nfew within a year all over the earth’s surface; and those, moreover,\r\nwill presumably strongly resemble the single-cell spores with which the\r\nwinds play in our atmosphere. It would be difficult, if not impossible,\r\nto prove the celestial origin of any such germs if they should be found\r\ncontrary to our assumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END",
