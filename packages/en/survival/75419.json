In this little booklet I will endeavor to explain\r\nnot only why the poultry business has grown so rapidly, but will also\r\nreveal the most important secrets that have contributed largely to\r\nits rapid growth, so that whether the reader is a farmer, a town lot\r\nfancier, or a student of economics, he or she will gain much by the\r\nreading and the studying of the principles involved.\r\n\r\nThe high cost of living has forced many people to economize to the\r\nlimit, and reduce the family budget to the minimum. People in the small\r\ntowns and villages, especially, have sought various ways of increasing\r\ntheir earnings, and one of the most popular methods resorted to has\r\nbeen to raise a few chickens, thus utilizing the table scraps, and odds\r\nand ends, so that there will be no waste. It has been proved beyond a\r\nshadow of a doubt that chickens can be raised profitably by the person\r\nliving in town, as well as by the farmer with his vast acres, providing\r\nthe townsman knows a few essential principles in regard to the proper\r\nhandling of the birds.\r\n\r\nPoultry products are becoming popular more than ever before. This\r\nis due in part to the increased price of beef and pork. Eggs are an\r\nestablished part of the nation’s menu, while the meat of the chicken is\r\nnow within the means of most American families. Since these facts are\r\nrecognized, there has been a revolution in the poultry industry itself\r\nto cope with the increased demand for eggs, meat, and breeding stock.\r\n\r\nMany city people have taken advantage of the opportunity of raising\r\nchickens, and many an old packing box, or piano box has been relieved\r\nof its original purpose of encasing furniture, or other articles, and\r\nhas done its bit to act as part of a shelter for housing some back-yard\r\nlot of chickens. What has been done, can be done, and inasmuch as the\r\nvalue of the egg, or the carcass of the bird still maintains its high\r\nstandard on the market, it stands to reason that the poultry industry\r\nis still in its infancy. Much more will be done in the future than has\r\nbeen done in the past.\r\n\r\nConsequently, there is still one industry that is not overcrowded,\r\ndespite the great number who have taken it up, either as a vocation, or\r\nas an avocation. When it is considered that New York City alone cannot\r\nget enough eggs to supply the demand during the fall and winter months,\r\nand is willing to pay, and pay dearly for breakfast eggs, and that the\r\nvicinity of Pataluma, Cal., finds it profitable to ship its eggs across\r\nthe continent to put them on the New York market, it can be seen quite\r\nclearly that there are excellent possibilities in poultry, even in just\r\na small back yard flock.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of this booklet will be devoted to showing the ordinary\r\nlayman, who has had no previous knowledge or experience, how he can\r\ntake a small flock, or a large flock, and turn it into pleasure and\r\nprofit. However, one word of caution is necessary. Let no one attempt\r\nto venture upon a poultry enterprise on a big scale at first. History\r\nhas shown countless failures in such attempts, and history has a way of\r\nrepeating itself. It is always wiser to start moderately, and work into\r\nit gradually. This method always proves successful if common sense and\r\nmoderation are exhibited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE POULTRY BREEDS\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to discuss the methods of raising poultry it is\r\ndeemed advisable to first take up a discussion of the different breeds\r\nand their characteristics. Outside of a few fancy breeds, that are\r\nraised more for curiosity or show purposes, we usually think of the\r\nbreeds of poultry as three distinct classes.\r\n\r\nThe first of these three classes that we will take up for discussion\r\nis what is termed the egg breed. This breed is usually represented by\r\nsuch birds as the Leghorn, Ancona, Campine, Minorca, or the Houdan.\r\nOf these five breeds, the Leghorn and the Minorca are by far the most\r\npopular. There are different varieties of all these breeds, but the\r\nWhite Leghorn, and the Black Minorca are much more popular in their\r\nrespective breeds than are any other variety. The other breeds are\r\nfound scattered here and there, but the Leghorn and Minorca are easily\r\nthe leading egg breeds. Both of these breeds have many birds with\r\nyearly records of over 300 eggs per year. Next let us consider a few of\r\nthe important characteristics of these egg breeds.\r\n\r\nThese breeds are small, light of weight, very active, and very hard to\r\nconfine in a small inclosure. The average adult bird of these breeds\r\nweighs about four pounds. They are neat and attractive in appearance,\r\nhave clean shanks, and have large head parts, which are much more\r\nsusceptible to being frosted in cold weather, than the other breeds.\r\n\r\nThe egg production of the egg breed is of the best. As has been stated,\r\nthere are a great number of birds in this class that have records of\r\nover 300 eggs per year. Their eggs are white shelled, of good size,\r\nand rather long. However the meat of these birds, especially when\r\nmatured, is very tough, and the active disposition of the egg breeds\r\ndo not allow them to put on surplus flesh as with the other class of\r\nbirds. Quick maturity is characteristic of the egg breeds, however, and\r\nbecause of this fact, they make excellent small broilers when but a few\r\nmonths old. But it is useless to put them on the market for meat when\r\nmature, as they will not fatten like the heavier breeds.\r\n\r\nThe disposition of these breeds, as has been said, is active, nervous,\r\nand hard to confine. Therefore, for the person with a small lot on\r\nwhich to raise chickens, it would be well to choose a heavier breed\r\nthat stands confinement better than these breeds. These birds are\r\nactive in the house in winter, or on the range in summer, and owing to\r\ntheir natural tendency to roam, they are always uneasy when confined\r\nto a small yard. They also have excellent powers of flight, and can\r\nusually fly over a fence unless the fence is about eight feet high.\r\n\r\nThe egg breed, owing to the activity so characteristic to such breeds,\r\nmakes poor sitters and mothers. It is very seldom that a fowl of these\r\nbreeds can content herself to sit on a nest of eggs three weeks, which\r\nis the time required to hatch the eggs. Their eggs are usually hatched\r\nunder a general purpose hen, or with an incubator. They make poor\r\nmothers, because they usually like to roam too far to properly look\r\nafter their young.\r\n\r\nAnother point in favor of the egg breeds, however, is their early\r\nmaturity. Usually these birds will mature in close to four months. This\r\nallows them plenty of time to get into laying condition in the fall,\r\nbefore cold weather starts, and birds that can lay eggs during the\r\nmonths of November and December are certainly an asset, as eggs always\r\nbring the highest prices on the market during these two months.\r\n\r\nThese birds will live on less feed than any other class because of\r\ntheir small size, and their great foraging ability. However, these\r\nbreeds are not as hardy as the heavier breeds, and will not stand\r\nthe cold as well, because of their lack of feathers, and large combs\r\nand wattles. These large head parts are easily frost bitten in cold\r\nweather, and when this happens the birds generally stop laying until\r\nthey have recovered from the setback. With these few words on the egg\r\nbreed characteristics, let us next consider the general purpose breed.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of general purpose breeds, we usually mean one of four\r\ndifferent breeds. The Plymouth Rock, Rhode Island Red, Orpington, and\r\nthe Wyandotte are the four leading breeds of this class. Then there\r\nare quite a few different varieties of each of these four breeds, such\r\nas the Barred Rock, the White Rock, the Buff Rock, etc. These breeds\r\nare very good both as egg birds, and for meat purposes, and find favor\r\nwhere ever they go. I will attempt to analyze their characteristics,\r\nbringing out their strong points and their weak points, as I have\r\nalready done with the egg breeds.\r\n\r\nThese breeds have been developed for egg production, and as a result,\r\nhave many birds in the 300 egg class, as well as the strictly egg\r\nbreeds. If any are to be disposed of, they have the ability to put\r\non flesh and to bring a good price on the market for meat. When one\r\nrealizes that usually one half of a hatch of chickens are males, and\r\nthe other half females, it can be easily seen that the general purpose\r\nbird has an advantage, in the sale of the male birds, and of the\r\nsurplus females, as they can be fed fattening feeds, and a good profit\r\nmade from this source.\r\n\r\nThe general purpose birds make excellent mothers and sitters. They\r\nhave a broody disposition, and will set on the nest the required three\r\nweeks to hatch the chickens. They will also take care of their young as\r\na parent should. In fact, one of the criticisms of this class of birds\r\nis that they are too broody, and are a nuisance in this particular.\r\nThey are far more quiet than the egg breeds, and stand confinement with\r\nno apparent discomforture. They make an ideal bird for the back lot.\r\n\r\nThese birds are fairly good foragers, but take a little more feed to\r\nmaintain their upkeep than do the egg breeds. They have smaller head\r\nparts than the egg breeds, and a heavier coating of flesh and feathers\r\nthus enabling them to withstand cold weather much better than the egg\r\nbreeds.\r\n\r\nThese breeds, in most cases, have yellow shanks, long well rounded\r\nbodies, and weigh about six pounds at maturity. They are not as nervous\r\nor as active as the egg breeds, but require a month or two longer to\r\nmature and to get into laying condition, than the egg breeds.\r\n\r\nWe will close this discussion on breed characteristics with a few words\r\non the meat breeds. There are four generally recognized meat breeds.\r\nThese are the Brahams, Cochins, Langshans, and the Cornish Game, with\r\ntheir several varieties. The adult meat bird usually weighs about\r\neight pounds, but the male birds weigh even more than this, sometimes\r\nreaching twelve pounds or more. These birds are rather awkward and\r\nclumsy, in fact, so much so that they make poor sitters, as their\r\nawkwardness often causes them to break the eggs in the nest. They have\r\nan abundance of feathers and meat on their body, which makes them easy\r\nto winter. Generally speaking, the heavier the bird, the poorer the\r\nlaying ability, and this is true with the meat breeds. They do not lay\r\na very large number of eggs during the year, being raised mostly for\r\ntheir flesh, which is unsurpassed for table purposes. As is the custom\r\nwith heavy animals, the meat birds are lazy and sluggish, do not roam\r\nfar for their food, and consume a comparatively large amount of grain\r\nfor this reason. The meat breeds take a longer period of time to gain\r\nmaturity than any other class, the average time being about eight\r\nmonths. As has been said, they are primarily a meat breed, and it is\r\nfor this purpose that they are mostly used. They do lay eggs, however,\r\nand about 100 eggs per year is a good average. They, like the general\r\npurpose breed, lay a brown shelled egg, while the egg breeds lay a\r\nwhite shelled egg, which brings a higher price on every market in the\r\ncountry but the Boston market. The brown shelled egg brings the higher\r\nprice on the Boston market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nGETTING A START\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now discussed quite minutely the good and bad points of the\r\nthree main classes of birds. Each class, and each breed has its merits\r\nand demerits. The one who wants to make a start in raising poultry\r\nshould choose the breed that appeals to his likes the most, and the\r\none that he can realize the most success with, under the conditions\r\nthat he will have to raise them. There is no best breed, whether it is\r\nchickens, cows, or hogs. They all have their good points, and their\r\nweak ones. It is up to each individual to pick the breed that appeals\r\nto him the most.\r\n\r\nGranted that you have pretty near decided the breed that you want to\r\nuse, let us see how we can secure our first birds, if we have none as\r\nyet to start with. There are generally three different ways in which\r\nwe can secure our foundation stock. The first way is by buying adult\r\nbirds and mating them, and raising the resulting chicks. Another way is\r\nby purchasing hatching eggs, either from a neighbor or from a regular\r\nbreeder or hatchery. The third way is by buying day-old chicks from\r\nthe various hatcheries, and raising these to maturity. Let us consider\r\neach of these methods separately, and thereby inform ourselves on the\r\nadvantages and disadvantages of each method.\r\n\r\nIn selecting adult birds for breeding purposes, and thus relying on\r\nthese birds to produce the hatching eggs, a few points are necessary\r\nto bear in mind, if one wants the best results. As these birds are to\r\nbe the foundation of your future flock, don’t buy them too hastily,\r\nand also do not try to buy the cheapest birds that you can find on the\r\nmarket, as you usually get just what you pay for. Therefore, the first\r\nthing to do is to look through poultry papers, farm weeklies, etc., or\r\nto inquire locally from some neighboring breeder, and find out just\r\nwhat it will cost you for adult females. Having the desired breed in\r\nmind, it would be advisable to post yourself on the qualifications,\r\nand the disqualifications of this particular breed. Standard weight\r\nfor the breed is an important consideration in this connection. If the\r\nstandard weight for an adult female is five pounds, try to get females\r\nthat weigh around six pounds. These qualifications can be found for\r\nevery breed in the American Standard of Perfection, a book published by\r\nthe American Poultry Association, and found in most libraries. Another\r\nvery important factor is the health of the birds. No birds should\r\nbe used for breeding purposes that have ever had any of the common\r\npoultry diseases, such as roup, chicken pox, etc., as their resulting\r\nchicks will also have a tendency toward this disease. Select nothing\r\nbut healthy, vigorous birds, of standard weight and color, free from\r\ndisease, of good body conformation, and not less than one year old.\r\nWhen pullets, or birds of less than a year old, are used for breeding,\r\nthe result is a small egg, which hatches out a small, under-sized\r\nchick.\r\n\r\nIf you can get in touch with your State College of Agriculture, they\r\ncan usually inform you of some reliable breeder who can furnish you\r\nwith the kind of birds you want. In selecting the cockerels, or male\r\nbirds, one very good way is to buy them from an unrelated flock, and\r\nbuy some that are especially strong where the females are weak. For\r\ninstance, if the females that you have purchased are a little light in\r\ncolor, it would be advisable to secure males that are a little darker\r\nin color than the standard calls for. It is never advisable to mate\r\nmore than ten females with one male, because if more are mated, the\r\nfertility of the eggs will suffer. Many successful breeders even use\r\ntwo male birds with a pen of ten females, alternating one male in the\r\nbreeding pen every other day. Thus the fertility of the hatching egg is\r\ndoubly assured.\r\n\r\nA cheaper method of securing the foundation stock is in buying the\r\nhatching eggs, but not quite as satisfactory as the first method.\r\nThese eggs are usually sold by the sitting, amounting to fifteen\r\neggs, or by the hundred. When buying by the sitting, one buys from a\r\nregular breeder, and pays anywhere from $1.50 up to as high as $50 per\r\nsitting. It is not advisable for the beginner to pay either of these\r\nextremes, but to plan to buy eggs not over $5 per setting. Then as you\r\nprogress in the business, you can purchase males to mate with your\r\nfemales to gradually improve your flock. This method necessitates the\r\nuse of an incubator, unless you can arrange with some friend who will\r\nloan you the use of his incubator. Of course, if you already have some\r\nmature birds, even of a different breed, you can set these eggs under\r\nthese birds, when they become broody in the spring, and secure even a\r\nlarger hatch than you can from the use of an incubator. Generally, a\r\nmature bird can set on about fifteen eggs, and hatch every fertile egg\r\nin the sitting. A more detailed discussion on incubation will be given\r\nin the next chapter.\r\n\r\nThe third way that one can secure a start in the poultry business, is\r\nby buying day-old chicks. This is an industry that has grown by leaps\r\nand bounds in the last few years. The price generally charged for these\r\nday-old chicks is twice as much as is charged for the hatching eggs. A\r\nfair price for 100 day-old chicks is from $15 to $20. Of course, the\r\nquality of these chicks is inferior to the higher priced sittings of\r\neggs, but if one is not so particular as to type and show purposes,\r\nthis method is very satisfactory. The day-old chick business is\r\nfounded upon the principle that it is not advisable to feed the chick\r\nfor the first forty-eight hours of its life, because just before the\r\nchick emerges from the shell, it absorbs the remainder of the yolk of\r\nthe egg, and it is exceedingly dangerous to feed the chick any food\r\nduring that period, as the chick will be sure to experience digestive\r\ntroubles, if any thing besides water and grit is given to the chicks\r\nfor the first two days. Therefore, these chicks are placed in a well\r\nventilated box and sent by parcel post often as far as a thousand\r\nmiles, with no loss in mortality. For one that has no incubator or\r\nmature hens, this offers a very satisfactory method of starting out\r\nin the chicken business. There are commercial hatcheries all over the\r\ncountry that make a business of purchasing hatching eggs from raisers\r\nof purebred poultry, and hatching these eggs in mammoth incubators,\r\nselling the chicks as soon as hatched, in the manner described.\r\n\r\nThus, the one interested in getting a start in poultry has an option\r\non either of these three ways. The local circumstances of the purchaser\r\nwill largely determine which method will be the best. But which ever\r\nmethod is used, let me caution you that too much care can not be given\r\nin finding a source that is perfectly honorable in their business\r\ndealings, as there has been in the past a considerable amount of unfair\r\ndealing on the part of some dealers in the poultry business, but I\r\nam glad to say that these people are fast being weeded out, and the\r\ntendency is now for honest, upright dealings in all three branches of\r\nthe industry, as the dishonest people have found that their methods\r\nforced them out of the business. Not everybody will be independent of\r\nthe incubator, however, so we will next discuss something in regard\r\nto the commercial incubator, also including and comparing the natural\r\nincubation of the egg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nINCUBATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to get a better idea of artificial incubation, let us first\r\nexamine a few facts concerning the way in which the hen hatches her\r\neggs in the natural process. The fertile egg is hatched when the egg\r\nis subjected to a heat over 100 degrees, F., for a period of about\r\ntwenty-one days. The mother hen, by setting on the eggs for this\r\nperiod, will bring off her hatch on the twenty-first day, if she has\r\nbeen given ordinary care. Let us see what are the principles involved\r\nin this natural incubation, that we may the better understand the\r\nartificial method of incubation.\r\n\r\nWhen the hen first becomes broody, and wants to sit, she might try to\r\n“steal her nest.” This is another way of saying that she will try to\r\nlocate some secluded spot, and after she has succeeded in laying a\r\ndozen or fifteen eggs, she will then spend nearly her entire time on\r\nthe nest, until she proudly marches back to her old haunts with a small\r\nclutch of chickens.\r\n\r\nIt is a natural instinct of most hens to become broody in the spring\r\nof the year, to reproduce their kind. A constant desire to sit on the\r\nnest is a sure sign of broodiness. When one has the eggs to put under\r\nthe hen to hatch, it is best first to try to secure a general purpose\r\nbird for this method, as they have been found the best, for reasons\r\npreviously stated.\r\n\r\nNow let us prepare a nest for the bird, so that she will have a good\r\nopportunity to do her best work. We can either partition off a part\r\nof the chicken house, or we can fix up a nest in another building\r\nentirely, such as a garage, barn, or any other building that we may\r\nhave on the premises. Next let us take some soil, and make a round\r\nnest, over a foot in diameter, and four or five inches deep. Then we\r\nwill dig out the center of the nest, so as to make it hollow in the\r\nmiddle, leaving at least two inches depth in the center. Then we will\r\ncover this earth with a few inches of cut straw, shavings, or leaves,\r\nand press this covering down to conform to the shape of the soil\r\nfoundation. We can now place our eggs for hatching in the nest, and put\r\nthe bird on them. However, best results will be obtained if we wait\r\nuntil towards evening before we place the bird on the nest, as she will\r\nbe more contented then. Take the bird that you have chosen and place\r\nher gently upon the nest of eggs. If she is at all broody, she will be\r\nquite contented when she feels the eggs underneath her, and settle down\r\nto business at once. The hen should spend practically all of the next\r\nthree weeks upon the nest, the only time that she should be allowed to\r\nleave being the short time that she takes food and water twice a day.\r\nHaving a quiet place, and giving her nourishment twice a day, she will\r\nbe quite contented. The hen does not need any special ration during\r\nthis time, other than one that is fairly heating. Corn is excellent\r\nduring this period, supplemented with a few other grains, such as oats,\r\nwheat, etc. A sufficient amount of fresh water should be available,\r\ntogether with some kind of green food, if possible, such as cabbage or\r\nmangoes. The hatch will not be endangered by the hen leaving the nest\r\nto eat. In fact, it is beneficial to the eggs to be temporarily cooled,\r\nat least once a day, while the hen is off the nest for a while.\r\n\r\nThe hen has a habit of turning the eggs under her every day, not only\r\nremoving their position from the center to the outside, and vice\r\nversa, but also turning them over, so that perhaps the part of the egg\r\nthat was in contact with the nest one day, will be in contact with\r\nthe hen’s body the next day. Or, in other words, she turns it half\r\nway around. These are all peculiarities that we have to imitate in\r\nartificial incubation, if we would be successful. Now that we have seen\r\nthe process of the natural method of incubation, let us see how the\r\ningenuity of man has successfully imitated the mother hen, and made\r\npossible the hatching of a far greater number of chicks than the hen\r\ncan naturally hatch.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, there are a great many incubators on the market,\r\nsome being made to sell, and others being made to use. How shall we\r\ndetermine the make to buy? That is not the easiest question in the\r\nworld, if one has had no previous experience with incubators. Do not\r\nnecessarily buy the incubator that is advertised the most. Sometimes\r\nincubator companies have to advertise extensively to do a sufficient\r\nvolume of business. The safest way to choose an incubator, if you\r\nreally intend to purchase one, is to get the advice of some one\r\nwho is using one, and has had success with the machine that he has\r\nused. Some of the cheaper makes have the trouble of too varying a\r\ntemperature, especially during the night. If one has to arise five or\r\nsix times a night for three weeks to regulate the lamp to maintain a\r\nconstant temperature, then the incubator is more bother than it is\r\nworth. Therefore, find out the makes of incubators that are giving\r\nsatisfaction in your own community, if you are intending to purchase\r\none, and then send for one of a similar make. However, if you have not\r\nenough eggs to warrant purchasing one, then try to arrange with someone\r\nto loan you one, or to put your eggs in with some of theirs, so as to\r\neliminate this expense.\r\n\r\nThere are in general two types of incubators, the hot water and the\r\nhot air, the latter being quite the more popular of the two. There\r\nare several different sizes of incubators, ranging from a fifty egg\r\ncapacity up to a thousand egg capacity machine. An incubator with a\r\nhundred egg capacity is usually sufficiently large enough for the\r\nsmall poultry keeper. By running three or four hatches during the same\r\nseason, a good number of chicks can be hatched.\r\n\r\nThere are a few requirements that must be fulfilled to realize the\r\nbest results from an incubator. First and foremost, always follow the\r\ninstructions that come with the incubator. The manufacturers of the\r\nincubator know more about their incubator than you do. Another thing\r\nthat should be borne in mind is that you must not expect every egg\r\nthat is placed in the incubator to produce a chick. A very good hatch\r\nis about 75 per cent. Of course, this varies considerably, ranging all\r\nthe way from nothing to as high as sometimes 100 per cent. Usually one\r\ncan reasonably expect as high as a 60 per cent hatch, at least, and\r\nvery often it goes considerably higher, according to the conditions\r\nunder which it is run.\r\n\r\nMoisture is a prime essential for the proper running of an incubator,\r\nand this should be provided for. If possible, arrange to run the\r\nincubator in a cellar, or some damp place. This can be aided, by\r\nsprinkling water on the floor, etc. Care must be exercised in running\r\nthe incubator that fire is guarded against, and some insurance\r\ncompanies make special provisions in their policies for such occasions,\r\nand make a slightly higher charge for their policies, because of the\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nAnother essential condition for a successful hatch with the incubator\r\nis proper ventilation. Most machines are provided with something\r\nfor the admission of fresh air. It is also necessary that the room\r\ncontaining the incubator be aired frequently to admit fresh air, but\r\nnot in such a manner that the eggs will become chilled, or that\r\ntoo much air will be admitted so as to carry off the moisture. Most\r\nincubators carry proper directions so as to provide against this danger.\r\n\r\nThe third condition necessary for proper running of the incubator is\r\nthe maintenance of a constant temperature. It is usually advisable to\r\nhave the temperature about 102 degrees F. the first week, 103 degrees\r\nthe second week, and 104 degrees the third week. Any serious deviation\r\nfrom 103 degrees will result in a poor hatch.\r\n\r\nNow, then we will conclude this chapter with a few pointers on running\r\nthe incubator during the hatching period. It is always well to run the\r\nincubator a day or two empty, so as to get the idea of how to best\r\nmaintain the required temperature. Clean the lamp thoroughly before\r\nrunning, and then during the hatch, always tend to the lamp after the\r\neggs have been turned, and never before, because if the hands are\r\nsmeared with kerosene, some of this is bound to be left on the shells,\r\nwhich will result in a poor hatch. Do not allow the lamp to be in a\r\ndraft, and clean the wick every day, so as to prevent the lamp from\r\nsmoking.\r\n\r\nAfter the first few days, the eggs should be turned at least once a\r\nday, and even better, twice a day. This is to imitate the mother hen,\r\nwho does this on the nest. If the eggs are not turned, then the embryo\r\nof the chick will adhere to the shell of the egg, and either die, or be\r\ncrippled beyond hope.\r\n\r\nWe must imitate the mother hen again in the artificial incubation of\r\nchicks, in regard to cooling. We saw in the previous chapter, how the\r\nhen leaves her nest occasionally to take food and water, with no ill\r\neffects on the hatch. Likewise we must cool the eggs in the incubator.\r\nThis can usually best be accomplished while turning the eggs. Five or\r\nten minutes a day are usually sufficient for the proper cooling, unless\r\nit is near the end of the hatch, when twenty or thirty minutes can be\r\nused for this purpose with safety.\r\n\r\nOn the seventh and the fourteenth day, it is a good plan to test the\r\neggs in the incubator, so that the infertile eggs may be removed. This\r\nis done by a process known as candling. Hold each egg up in front of a\r\nlight and note the appearance of the interior of the egg. This can be\r\ndone by making a hole in a box, that will fit over a light or lamp, and\r\nthen holding the eggs up to the light, showing through the hole, which\r\nshould be in line with the flame. If the egg appears clear, free from\r\nany dark spots, then the egg can be taken out of the incubator, as it\r\nis not fertile, and will not hatch. However, if the egg shows a dark\r\nspot, about the size of a bean, and you can detect small blood vessels\r\nrunning from it, then you may be assured that the egg is coming along\r\nin good shape, and will hatch out in due time.\r\n\r\nWith these points well in mind, one will have little difficulty in\r\nproperly running an incubator, providing he has a reliable machine to\r\nbegin with. Of the matters considered in this chapter, probably the\r\nmost important factor of all is the constant maintenance of a uniform\r\ntemperature. Now, then, let us consider that the chicks are pipping the\r\nshells and are ready to start out in life. We will therefore consider\r\nthe care of the chicks in the next chapter, until they are able to care\r\nfor themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nBROODING\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether we hatched the eggs by means of an incubator, or bought the\r\nday-old chicks, if we have no mother hen to care for the chicks after\r\nthey are hatched, we must take care of them ourselves. This is called\r\nthe brooding period. Unless the hatch is quite late, which, by the way,\r\nis not desirable, we will have to arrange to supply some cheap, simple\r\nform of artificial heat, to prevent the young chickens from getting\r\nchilled. This is accomplished in several different ways, but we will\r\nonly discuss the more common ways here.\r\n\r\nThere are several different makes of readymade brooders on the market,\r\nbut one can in a few hours spare time, construct a brooder that will\r\nanswer the purpose. The chief part of the brooder is the source of\r\nheat. Usually these heaters can be bought for a few dollars, and placed\r\nin a good box supplied with a little litter on the bottom.\r\n\r\nA common arrangement with brooder equipments is to have two\r\ncompartments, one where a hover is placed, and the rest of the\r\nbrooder constituting a run for the chicks. The two compartments are\r\nusually partitioned off from each other, allowing just enough room\r\nat the bottom of the partition to allow the chicks to pass from one\r\ncompartment to the other. In the hover compartment is placed the\r\nheater, and a metal canopy, so that the heat will be held down close to\r\nthe floor, where the chicks are located. At first, the chicks should be\r\nconfined to this hover entirely, because they are liable to get lost if\r\nthey wander away from the hover, and consequently die from chilling.\r\nThe temperature of the hover compartment during the first week should\r\nbe about 96 degrees F., and each succeeding week it should be lowered\r\nby at least two degrees. This can be done by controlling the lamp,\r\nor what ever heater is used, or by gradually raising or lowering the\r\ncanopy over the chicks. This method gradually toughens the chicks up,\r\nso that they can soon be let out doors. After the first week or so,\r\nthey should be encouraged to get out into the other compartment for\r\nexercise, as this will aid in making them hardy. After the first few\r\nweeks of the life of the chicks are past, they will need less care and\r\nattention. These first few weeks are the critical weeks of the bird’s\r\nlife. After the chicks get accustomed to the temperature out in the\r\nrun of the brooder, it is advisable to cut a small hole at the run end\r\nof the brooder box, so that on pleasant days they can run outside on\r\nthe ground around the brooder. In this case, however, they must not be\r\nallowed to run very far at first, and only for a short while until they\r\ngradually become accustomed to the practice.\r\n\r\nAnother important consideration in raising the young chick to maturity\r\nis the matter of food. Probably no other thing is responsible for such\r\na high mortality in young chicks, as is improper feeding. We have\r\nlearned in a previous chapter that it is exceedingly dangerous to feed\r\nthe chick anything in the line of food for the first two days of its\r\nlife. Many people are afraid the chicks will die if not fed immediately\r\nafter hatching, and hasten to feed the chick all that it will eat.\r\nUnless the chick is endowed with a wonderful digestive system, it\r\nwill succumb to this over-feeding through digestive disorders. It\r\nis permissible to put a little grit before the chick at this time,\r\nbecause the chick has no teeth, and never will have, so they eat the\r\ngrit, and this grit passes down to the gizzard, which grinds the food\r\nin place of grinding with the teeth, as with other animals. Fresh\r\nwater is also good for the chick during this period, as the water\r\nquenches their thirst, and makes them livelier. Towards the end of the\r\nsecond day, it is well to feed the chick a little sour skim milk, or\r\nbuttermilk. Sour milk is superior to the sweet milk for two reasons.\r\nFirst, the sour skim milk has bacteria that aid in digestion, and\r\nsecondly, it will be found that it will be hard to keep the milk sweet\r\nall the time, and by feeding sweet milk part of the time, and then\r\nletting it become sour, digestive troubles are liable to develop.\r\nHence, by having it sour all the time, no danger from this source will\r\nbe experienced.\r\n\r\nNow, we are ready to consider what kind of grain we shall feed the\r\nchick. On the third day we can start to feed a little grain. What is\r\nknown as pinhead oatmeal is very good to start the young chick out on.\r\nSome feed hard boiled eggs and dried bread for the first feeding with\r\ngood results. It is important to note that only enough of this first\r\nsolid food should be fed that they can clean up in a short time. Keep\r\nthem hungry, and remember that it is much safer to under feed than to\r\nover feed.\r\n\r\nFor the next week, or so, a scratch ration, composed of cracked corn,\r\npinhead oatmeal, cracked wheat, together with a little grit, and finely\r\nground oyster shells can be fed. This can be fed in the litter, so that\r\nthe chicks have to exercise to get it. In fact, that is just what we\r\nmean by a scratching ration; one composed of whole or cracked grains,\r\nmixed in with the litter, so that the chicks will have to scratch for\r\ntheir feed, and thereby obtain the exercise necessary to their health.\r\nIf a little green feed of any kind can be added, so much the better.\r\nGreen grass is excellent to throw into the chicks.\r\n\r\nAfter two weeks or more of this kind of feed, it is well to supplement\r\nthis ration with a dry mash. A dry mash is a feed composed of ground\r\nfeeds, that require no work on the part of the bird to grind. Feeds\r\nlike wheat bran, ground oats, corn meal, etc., are good examples of\r\nsuch feeds. Wheat bran is especially well liked by these young birds,\r\nand it is recommended that they be allowed to have this as a large\r\npart of their dry mash. This feed should not be fed in the litter, as\r\nthe cracked grains, but placed in some such container as a pan, or\r\nbetter still, in a regular feed hopper. It can readily be seen that\r\nif this finely ground grain was scattered in the litter, it would be\r\nlargely lost and wasted. Also, if put in a pan, the pan must be low\r\nenough to be accessible to the birds, and covered over in such a manner\r\nthat the chicks will not get in and walk around in it. A homemade\r\nhopper can be easily built, so that the chicks can just get their heads\r\nin, and no more. Do not forget that the sour skim milk or buttermilk\r\nmust be fed all this time. In fact, this part of the feed should be fed\r\nright through the bird’s life, as it supplies the animal protein, which\r\nis so necessary to the proper development of the bird’s growth.\r\n\r\nNow, then, just a few more words in closing this chapter on brooding.\r\nWe should aim to toughen the birds up as quickly as possible, so\r\nthat when they are about two months old, no artificial heat will\r\nbe necessary, and if the birds are of a late hatch, this can be\r\naccomplished much sooner. Encourage them to get out of doors as\r\nquickly as possible, and to get green feed.\r\n\r\nA very serious cause of death among young chickens is from disease.\r\nWhite diarrhoea is probably one of the most common of these diseases,\r\nand unfortunately, one of the most fatal. If the droppings are of a\r\nwhite, watery nature, with an offensive odor, you may well believe\r\nthat this disease is present, and the thing to do is to get the birds\r\nthus affected out of the way at once, and disinfect with some good\r\ndisinfectant. However, if the precautions are taken that are set forth\r\nin this booklet, no danger of this dreaded disease can be anticipated.\r\n\r\nNow that we have got the chicks along through the brooding period, let\r\nus next consider just how we shall raise these chicks to maturity, so\r\nas to get them ready to lay eggs, or to make a good meat carcass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nREARING CHICKS TO MATURITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the chief things to remember in raising young chicks to maturity\r\nis that we must keep them growing at all times. A check in their\r\ngrowth will retard their growth severely, and this must be avoided\r\nby the one that wants his chicks to get into winter laying condition\r\nbefore the cold weather comes. We will now consider a few important\r\nfactors that are necessary to bring our chicks along to rapid growth.\r\n\r\nOf course, where free, unrestricted range is possible, the chicks\r\nwill progress faster than when cooped up in a small yard. If no free\r\nrange is possible, it will be found advantageous to at least let\r\nthe chicks run about the yard of the lot. In this manner, they can\r\npick up considerable food in the shape of worms, insects, etc., that\r\nwill furnish valuable growing food for them. Let me repeat again the\r\nnecessity of having milk in some form as a constituent of the chicks’\r\nfood. Any food that comes from an animal, whether it be milk or a part\r\nof the animal itself, is highly essential to the growth of the chick.\r\nSuch foods contain an element known as vitamines, which scientists have\r\nrecently discovered contribute greatly to the growth and upkeep of a\r\ngrowing animal. Vitamines are also found to some extent in green feeds,\r\nsuch as carrots, cabbages, mangoes, etc. Even well cured alfalfa hay\r\ncontains this important element. It is quite obvious, therefore, that\r\nif the chicks are out roaming around the yard or range, they not only\r\nsecure the exercise that is necessary for their proper development,\r\nbut they also pick up insects, as has been mentioned, and considerable\r\ngreen feed, such as grass, weeds, and various other odds and ends.\r\n\r\nIf a fair sized lot or range is to be had, then it will be found a\r\ngreat aid to make a little house for the chicks to live in during the\r\nnights on the range, although care must be exercised that they be\r\nprotected from enemies, such as rats, crows, skunks, weasels, owls,\r\netc. Such a house need not be expensive at all if it be made out of an\r\nold packing box that will protect the chicks from rain and enemies.\r\n\r\nAnother quite essential feature for the promotion of the maximum growth\r\nof the chicks during the warm summer months is the provision for shade.\r\nIf there are some trees about the yard or range, this will answer the\r\npurpose satisfactorily, but if there are no trees where the chicks\r\nroam, then some artificial shade is advised. Some people plant corn\r\nfor this purpose, allowing the chicks to range among the corn plants\r\nwhen the corn has grown sufficiently high. The chicks will not harm the\r\ncorn, so two ends can be accomplished by this means. Others provide\r\nthis shade by gathering old brush together and making an artificial\r\nshade in this manner. During the hot days of summer, the chicks will\r\nsuffer from the heat to a marked degree if exposed to the hot rays of\r\nthe sun. An ideal method used on many farms is to place the chicks in\r\nthe orchard, where there is an orchard, and let the chicks roam in the\r\nshade of the orchard trees.\r\n\r\nWhere birds are necessarily confined to a small yard, one method that\r\nhas been worked out satisfactorily, is to fence the yard off into two\r\nor more divisions, and to plow up the land. Then various crops can be\r\nsown at different intervals, so that when one range, or division, is\r\nconsumed by the chicks, they can be turned into another division where\r\nthe forage crop is up and ready to be consumed. As soon as the chicks\r\nare turned out of the first lot, this lot can be immediately plowed up\r\nagain, and some more seeds planted, so that this range will be ready\r\nfor the chicks when the second lot furnishes no more nourishment for\r\nthem. It might be added here that many town flocks of full grown\r\nbirds are maintained, by this very system, and it has worked out very\r\nnicely. Such grains as buckwheat, rye, oats, peas, and soy beans are\r\nall excellent crops to sow in this manner, using oats and peas for the\r\nfirst crop, because they mature quicker than the other crops mentioned.\r\n\r\nIf the chicks have access to a fair amount of range they will not need\r\na great deal of grain as a ration. However, it is always advisable\r\nto feed some grains to keep the birds continually growing as fast as\r\npossible. It has been proved conclusively that the first gains made by\r\nthe growing chicks are the cheapest, in regard to the cost of feed, so\r\nlet us keep this in mind during the time when we have them on range.\r\nTo accomplish this end, it is well to have a dry mash of the kind of\r\ngrains that are fairly rich in the substance called protein always\r\navailable in the hopper. The reason for this need of protein feed is\r\nsimply that the growing bird uses this element largely in the growth\r\nof its body. Protein goes to make up the bony framework of the body,\r\nand the muscles, tendons, etc. Therefore, feeds containing protein,\r\nor a fair amount of it at least, should be ground up, and kept before\r\nthe birds. Oats, bran, or middlings, wheat and barley, are all fairly\r\nrich in protein, and some of these feeds, in a finely ground condition,\r\nshould be included. It is also well to add some corn meal, although\r\nthis feed is not high in protein, it supplies a great amount of energy\r\nfor the bird to move around with. As soon as the birds are old enough\r\ncommence to feed cracked grains. As has been said in a previous\r\nchapter, the bird has no teeth, so must rely upon grit to grind this\r\nfeed in the gizzard.\r\n\r\nTherefore, unless the birds have a wide range, this grit must be\r\nartificially supplied. Then the birds can help themselves to their\r\nneeds, and suffer no digestive troubles. Fresh water must be before\r\nthe birds at all times, and if no natural source is available, such\r\nas a running stream or brook, then fresh water must be placed in some\r\nsanitary container out in the yard or range.\r\n\r\nFrom four to six months from the time the chick is hatched, it should\r\nbe ready to start laying eggs. The chick first has to get its growth\r\nand maturity, and then there is an apparent resting period for a few\r\nweeks, to allow the organs of the bird to get ready for egg production.\r\nWe will next consider how we shall feed these birds, granting that we\r\nnow have them ready to produce the eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nFEEDING FOR EGG PRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nAs has been said in an earlier chapter, to get the maximum egg\r\nproduction, three things are essential. They are: good foundation\r\nstock, proper housing, and proper feeding. We may have the best chicken\r\nhouse in the world, and the highest priced stock obtainable, but if we\r\ndo not feed our birds the right kind of food, all our other efforts are\r\nin vain. Let us consider first a few facts concerning the composition\r\nof the egg, and then we will be able to understand more intelligently\r\nwhy we should feed the laying bird these certain feeds.\r\n\r\nAbout 14 per cent of the composition of the egg is protein, 10 per\r\ncent fat, and the remainder, except the shell, is water. Now it must\r\nbe remembered that the ordinary protein supply of most food materials\r\nis relatively low. Corn contains about 7 per cent digestible protein,\r\noats and barley about 9 per cent, and bran about 12 per cent. The\r\nroughages are considerably lower, while green feeds carry about one or\r\ntwo per cent protein. From this we can get an idea about the necessity\r\nof watching the feeding to the extent that this valuable constituent\r\nis sufficiently supplied. Furthermore, the hen that is producing these\r\neggs needs a fair amount of this protein for further growth and body\r\nupkeep. Another point worth remembering is the fact that the bird, or\r\nany other animal, through natural instinct, always sees to it that the\r\nfirst requirement, that of bodily growth and upkeep are maintained\r\nfirst with the food they are given, so that to get the most from the\r\nbirds, let us not hold them down to just a maintenance ration, but give\r\nthem enough in addition so that they can not only maintain their body\r\nrequirements properly, but also have enough food material to yield a\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\nThe ration for the laying hen should consist of the two forms of grain;\r\nfirst, the whole or cracked grains that comprise the scratch ration,\r\nand which should always be thrown in the litter, so that they will\r\nhave to exercise to get it, and second, the dry mash, or a mixture\r\nof various grains that are ground up and fed in hoppers. As has been\r\nstated before, this grinding of the feed is simply to make it easily\r\ndigestible. Furthermore, such finely ground grains usually contain a\r\nhigher percentage of protein than the other grains. By this is meant\r\nthat feeds like bran, oilmeal, etc., are quite a bit higher in protein\r\nthan are grains like corn, wheat, barley, etc.\r\n\r\nThe next important feed requirement for the laying hen should be\r\na mineral feed of some kind. With many farm and city flocks this\r\nimportant consideration is entirely ignored. Many times the reason\r\nfor poor egg production rests solely in the lack of proper mineral\r\nfoods. When it is considered that about 12 percent of the entire egg is\r\ncomposed of shell material, it can readily be seen that the feeding of\r\nthis material is important, and worthy of attention. We can give the\r\nlaying bird all the rich feeds that we can buy, but if we withhold from\r\nher the material that goes to form the shell, then the bird will be\r\nunable to lay her eggs because she has no shell to cover the egg. There\r\nare different sources of mineral food, but all authorities are agreed\r\nthat oyster shells form the most economical source of shell material.\r\nThese oyster shells can be bought at grocery stores, or poultry supply\r\nhouses. This material should be placed in a box or, better still, a\r\nhopper, where it will be accessible to the birds at all times. Clam\r\nshells, lime rock grit, and dry bone in small sizes are other sources\r\nof mineral matter, and possibly even better results can be obtained by\r\nadding a small quantity of these other feeds to the oyster shells, but\r\nplan to have oyster shells as the basis of the mineral supply. Charcoal\r\nis sometimes fed to chickens with good results. Some birds eat this,\r\nwhile others will not. It is claimed that charcoal aids in regulating\r\nthe digestive system of the fowl. One can try this out to satisfy his\r\nown ideas in this regard.\r\n\r\nAnimal feed is the next class of feeds that we will consider in the\r\nfeeding of our laying flock. It is the testimony of poultrymen that\r\nwhen they hang up a fresh piece of meat in the poultry house, such as\r\na part of a calf, an old horse, rabbit, or any other such carcass,\r\nthe birds always respond with a much higher yield in egg production.\r\nThis simply reinforces the statement made in a previous chapter, that\r\nanimal protein of some kind is needed by the birds if they are to do\r\ntheir best. If meat is supplied, care must be exercised that it does\r\nnot spoil before it is consumed. It is better to put in small pieces at\r\na time, so that the birds will eat it up quickly. If this meat can be\r\nrun through a grinder of some kind, it will be eaten much more readily\r\nthan if it has to be torn to pieces by the birds. Milk of some kind is\r\nalso an animal protein, as has been repeated here several times. Meat\r\nmeal or tankage contains a high percentage of protein, and as this is\r\nan animal product, it is an economical feed.\r\n\r\nWater is our last class of feeds for the laying hen. This can be\r\nsupplied in two ways. The first way is from the water direct, placed\r\nin some kind of a pan that is covered so that the birds can not soil\r\nthe water, by perching on the edge of the pan, etc. Fresh water should\r\nbe before the birds at all times, as we have just learned a few pages\r\nback that about 65 per cent of the egg is composed of water. Besides\r\nthis, the birds need water for their body requirements. In the winter\r\nwhen the birds spend practically all of their time in the poultry\r\nhouse, and can not have the opportunity of picking up grass, and other\r\ngreen feeds, we can supply water to them in the form of some kind of\r\ngreen feeds, such as sprouted oats, cabbages, mangoes, or any other\r\nvegetables to be had. All these feeds are to be recommended highly,\r\nas they not only are composed largely of water, but add bulk to the\r\nration, and aid in keeping the bird laxative. Sprouted oats can be\r\nraised in shallow pans, and given to the birds in small quantities\r\nat a time. It is usually advisable to have several pans of sprouting\r\noats say, for instance, one for every day in the week, so that a fresh\r\nsupply can be given to the birds every morning. Nearly every supply\r\nhouse has patent oat sprouters to sell at reasonable prices. Cabbages\r\nand mangoes are also fed extensively to the laying birds during the\r\nwinter months, but provision must be made before hand to raise them in\r\nthe summer, and to properly store them in the fall, so that they will\r\nbe fresh when taken out of storage for feeding. One very good way to do\r\nthis is to pile them together in a basement and cover them with sand.\r\n\r\nLet us next consider a few practical grain rations, that have been\r\ntried out by successful poultry men. These rations are always\r\nclassified as scratch rations and dry mash rations. One very good\r\nration is as follows: Scratch Feed, 3 parts cracked corn, 1 part wheat,\r\n1 part oats, 1 part barley. Dry mash, 1½ part bran, 1½ part middlings,\r\n1 part corn meal, 1 part meat scraps or tankage. Another very good\r\npractical ration is composed as follows: Scratch feed, 3 parts corn,\r\n1 part oats, and 1 part barley. Dry mash, one part each of bran,\r\nmiddlings, ground corn, ground oats and meat scraps. These feeds should\r\nalways be measured by weight, and not by bulk.\r\n\r\nNow, then, just a few words in regard to the feeding of these grains.\r\nAlways send the birds to roost with full crops. This is especially\r\nimportant during cold weather. It is much better if they be allowed to\r\nfill up on scratch grain rather than dry mash. The scratch ration is\r\nmore bulky than the mash feed, and helps in keeping the bird warm. In\r\nfact, many successful poultry men close the hopper of their dry mash\r\nration during the afternoon, and thus make the birds take the scratch\r\nfeed in the litter, thereby encouraging the birds to obtain exercise,\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nWe will close this chapter with a brief discussion on a recent\r\ndevelopment in the system of feeding birds. This is in regard to the\r\nintroduction of artificial light. This practice has successfully passed\r\nbeyond the “fad” stage and is now being used by successful poultry men\r\nall over the country. By supplying this extra light, the working day\r\nis thereby lengthened to the extent that the light is prolonged, and\r\nconsequently, gives the bird a day similar to a summer day in length.\r\nThe birds, by having this extra period of light, work just that much\r\nlonger, and as a result, they are able to make more eggs. Everywhere\r\nthis system has been given a trial, it has been found a paying\r\nproposition. One very common method in supplying this light is by\r\nconnecting the alarm clock to the electric lighting system and setting\r\nthe alarm at a period around four or five o’clock in the morning. This\r\nthrows on the light in the chicken house, and then when the owner\r\narises in the morning, he can go out and turn out the lights if it is\r\nlight enough to do so by that time.\r\n\r\nThus we have considered the main points in feeding for egg production.\r\nWhile we have some of these important feeding principles still fresh in\r\nour mind, let us in the next chapter consider feeding birds for their\r\nflesh, because one very important part of the poultry business lies in\r\nthe feeding of birds for meat. In the ordinary flock of birds, there\r\nare always some that we want to dispose of, such as the male birds and\r\nthe culls of the females. If we know how to fatten these, we will be\r\nthat much better off financially.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nFEEDING FOR MEAT PRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary object in feeding birds for the market is to get them well\r\ncovered with flesh, so that they will be plump all over. It is the\r\ndifference in the weight of the bony skeleton and the weight of the\r\nwell filled out carcass that determines the amount of edible meat on\r\nthe bird. Hence our object in this process is to put on as much surplus\r\nflesh as we can.\r\n\r\nUsually there are three classes of birds that are put on the market\r\nfor meat purposes. They are roasters, broilers, and old hens. Roasting\r\nchickens are very common on the market, and the object is large size\r\nwith a tender carcass. These can be either pullets or cockerels, or\r\ncapons. They are often put on the market during the late fall or early\r\nwinter, and bring the highest prices at that time.\r\n\r\nBroilers are birds about three or four months old, forced along to\r\na rapid growth, but still possessing tender flesh. This offers an\r\nexcellent way of disposing of the male birds, since usually the sex of\r\nthe young birds can be distinguished at about two months of age.\r\n\r\nOld hens constitute the third division of the meat classes placed upon\r\nthe market, and are generally composed of those birds that are through\r\nlaying, or the ones that have been found to be unprofitable. Their\r\nmeat is usually much tougher than the first two mentioned classes, and\r\nconsequently used in city restaurants for meat pies, etc.\r\n\r\nIn fattening birds for the market, a somewhat different procedure is\r\nfollowed than in feeding for egg production. We found that in feeding\r\nfor egg production we encouraged the birds in every way possible to\r\ntake all the exercise that they could get. We do just the opposite\r\nin putting flesh on the birds. We restrict their exercise as much as\r\npossible, and pen them up in small quarters so that their feed largely\r\ngoes to nothing but putting flesh on their bodies. It can easily be\r\nseen that when birds are roaming around, exercising more or less all\r\nday long, that there is little chance for them to get very fat.\r\n\r\nNow as to the nature of the feed for fattening these birds. We will\r\nstill need some protein feeds, but not as much as in the case of\r\nfeeding for eggs. However, we will need feeds which are quite rich in\r\ncarbohydrates and fat. These are easily obtained and are relatively\r\ncheap. Corn is an excellent ration for this purpose.\r\n\r\nSince the birds are confined to small pens, and exercise restricted,\r\nit becomes evident that digestion becomes an important factor here.\r\nTherefore, it is advisable to have plenty of grit before the birds at\r\nall times, so that their food will be properly ground.\r\n\r\nWe must not get the idea, just because we are feeding for flesh, that\r\nthe birds should be stuffed to their limit with feed. To do so, would\r\nbe to have a lot of the birds off feed, and consequently we would be\r\nworse off than not to feed them enough. It is best to plan to feed them\r\nabout three times a day, and to feed them all that they will cleanup in\r\na certain length of time, as from twenty minutes to half an hour. Some\r\nare successful in feeding only twice a day, instead of three times a\r\nday.\r\n\r\nCorn is usually the basis of fattening rations and should always\r\nhave a prominent place in the ration. Here again, milk in some form\r\nis excellent to supply some of the protein that is needed. Corn must\r\nbe supplemented by other grains, such as oats, barley or middlings,\r\nprovided they are in a finely ground condition. Some feeders follow the\r\nplan of feeding part of these grains in the form of a wet mash, using\r\nthe skim milk to moisten the mash, but when this is done, care must\r\nbe exercised in seeing that the mash is cleaned up at every feeding,\r\notherwise the trough will become mouldy, with bad results to the birds.\r\n\r\nThere has come into use within recent years a method of fattening\r\nbirds by what is known as crate fattening. This is practiced\r\nconsiderably by some of the big packing companies. The birds are\r\nbought up from the surrounding territory and brought into the central\r\nfattening station. They are then placed in small pens, or batteries,\r\nas they are called, and fed a ration composed largely of skim milk and\r\ncorn meal, with a few other feeds added, such as red dog flour, bran,\r\netc. This is mixed into a thin, pasty feed, and fed the birds from a\r\ntrough running along in front of the pens. They are fed this way for a\r\nperiod of two weeks or more, and are then taken out, dressed, and sold\r\nto the big city markets as milk fed chickens, and always bring several\r\ncents a pound more on the market than other poultry, because of the\r\ntenderness of the flesh. In this process, even greater care must be\r\nexercised in watching the feeding of the birds, and only feed that they\r\nwill cleanup in about fifteen or twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nCrate feeding has appealed to many town lot poultry men, who have\r\nbought up culls of the neighboring territory, put them in small crates\r\nor pens, and fed them this milk feed for a few weeks and then marketed\r\nthem, securing the top prices on the market.\r\n\r\nWe have now discussed the most important items connected with the\r\nfeeding of the birds for various purposes. Let us now examine the\r\nliving quarters of the birds, and see if we can improve the housing\r\nconditions in which the birds live during the winter months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nCOMMON FAULTS OF POULTRY HOUSES\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you were to take a trip through the surrounding country, with\r\nthe intention of inspecting the living quarters of farm poultry,\r\nin general, you would discover some of the most wretched houses\r\nimaginable. All of our intelligent feeding would be of little use\r\nif we penned our chickens up in a coop with little sunlight, poor\r\nventilation, cold, damp floors, drafty sides, and foul, damp air. It\r\ndoesn’t cost any more to build a poultry house with correct principles\r\ninvolved, than it does to build one that lacks these essential\r\nfeatures. The birds care very little about the appearance of the house.\r\nThey want fresh dry air, freedom from drafts, a warm floor, and plenty\r\nof sunshine.\r\n\r\nOne of the most common faults with most poultry houses is the matter of\r\nventilation. When poultry raising was first looked upon as a promising\r\nbusiness, many men erected houses containing a large proportion of\r\nglass. It was thought that the sunshine was the only necessary feature\r\nfor the birds under winter conditions, and they made their chicken\r\nhouses veritable hot houses. But the results were not as had been\r\nanticipated. It was found that while the houses were fairly warm in\r\nthe day time, they cooled off considerable at night, and poor results\r\nwere obtained from this wide range between the day temperature and the\r\nnight temperature. Then another step was taken by these pioneers. They\r\ndecided to heat their houses artificially. But even this system did not\r\nbring forth the big yield of eggs that had been hoped for. In all this\r\nexpensive procedure, a very important element had been overlooked, and\r\nthat was the matter of fresh air.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty years ago, there was devised a poultry house that was a\r\nradical departure from this previous type of house. It was called\r\nthe open front house, and gave surprisingly good results, where all\r\nprevious types had failed, as regards egg production. This house was\r\nconstructed briefly as follows: It was of the shed roof type; that is,\r\nhad just one slant in the roof, the highest pitch being in front, and\r\nthe lowest pitch in the rear. It had plenty of window light in the\r\nfront side, about half of the south side, or front, being devoted to\r\nwindows. The rest of the front was left open, save for a thin muslin\r\ncurtain to cover the open space during bad weather. These curtains\r\nwere tacked to wooden frames, and swung on hinges, so that they could\r\nbe swung in to cover the open space at will. The most remarkable thing\r\nabout the system was that the hens began to lay eggs, when proper\r\nfeeding was obtained. Later, this led to the conclusion, now generally\r\naccepted, that the birds can stand considerable cold, providing it is\r\nnot a damp cold, and that the temperature of the house is considerably\r\nmore uniform between night and day than was the case with the glass\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nAs a result many poultrymen who are making money with poultry use\r\nsome such system as the open front house with various changes. They\r\nhave found that fresh air is an absolute requirement to get the best\r\nresults. But this matter brought out a few more interesting facts. It\r\nwas found that dampness was a big drawback to egg production in cold\r\nweather. If the damp foul air, breathed out by the chickens, could not\r\nescape from the poultry building, the chickens did not have the health\r\nand vigor that they did in well ventilated houses. Consequently, the\r\ncurtain helped considerably in allowing the fresh air to come in, and\r\nfor the foul air to go out. The damp air, being heavily laden with\r\nmoisture, settled to the bottom of the house, where the birds scratch,\r\nand unless the curtains extend fairly well down near the bottom of\r\nthe house, the damp air has not a very good chance to escape, and\r\nconsequently, there will be more or less moisture even with this type\r\nof house, if the damp air has no chance to escape.\r\n\r\nAnother common fault with a great many poultry buildings is that they\r\nare drafty. The walls should all be air tight, except the south wall,\r\nor front, as has been mentioned. If there is a draft in the house the\r\nbirds will contract a cold, and will take a prolonged vacation from\r\ntheir job of laying eggs. It is not uncommon to find a crack in the\r\nwall, just behind the perches of the house, and when we consider that\r\nin such houses the birds stay all night in a direct draft, it is little\r\nwonder that they appear so unhealthy.\r\n\r\nThere are a few other common faults that we will consider before\r\nbringing this chapter to a close. It is often found that there are too\r\nmany birds cramped into a small house. It is a good plan to allow at\r\nleast four square feet of floor space for each bird that you winter.\r\nFor instance, if we were planning on having one hundred birds this\r\nwinter, we could have a house built twenty-five feet long, and sixteen\r\nfeet deep. Multiplying these two figures, gives us four hundred square\r\nfeet. Dividing this product by four, gives us allowance for one hundred\r\nbirds. Then, lastly, the floor, itself. Too often the floor is cold.\r\nIf a cement floor, we should cover it with about six or eight inches\r\nof good, clean, dry litter. Even if made of wood, a good substantial\r\nlitter should be maintained. The best litter is probably of straw,\r\nbut peat moss is fast gaining favor at present, where straw is not\r\nobtainable. With these few objections to guard against, let us next\r\ndiscuss just how we shall go about constructing a poultry house that\r\nwill overcome the faults mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nHOUSING POULTRY FOR PROFIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn discussing plans for a modern poultry house, let it be mentioned at\r\nthe outset that this does not necessarily mean that our modern house\r\nwill be expensive, any more than the one that is built on old ideas. In\r\nfact, many of the older houses were much more expensive than the modern\r\nhouses of today. As long as the poultry building includes the necessary\r\nprinciples for the birds’ well-being, and this can be accomplished with\r\nlittle added expense, that is all that is necessary.\r\n\r\nIn commenting upon the common faults of most poultry houses in the\r\nprevious chapter, we found that they generally lack one, or all of\r\nsuch items as ventilation, dryness, sunlight, adequate floor space,\r\nprotection from rats, protection from extremes of temperature, and\r\nsimplicity of design. In arranging for a better house for our birds,\r\nlet us plan to keep these factors in mind, so as to get the most from\r\nour birds.\r\n\r\nWhether we are to build a new poultry house, or to remodel an old one,\r\nwe can design it so that all of these factors will be in evidence. If\r\nwe have an old poultry house, or if we can buy cheaply an old poultry\r\ncoop, that has fairly good lumber in it, we can probably do the\r\nremodeling somewhat cheaper than if we have to buy all new lumber. If\r\nwe do purchase all new lumber, it is not advisable to get cheap lumber,\r\nbut buy the first grade, because it is necessary that the walls of the\r\nhouse be air tight, and this is seldom possible with cheap lumber.\r\n\r\nWe will first consider briefly the possibilities of remodeling an old\r\npoultry house. Probably the first thing that we will do is to cut some\r\nopenings in the front of the house for windows and curtains. From\r\none-half to two-thirds of the front should be devoted to window lights.\r\nThe remainder should be left for the muslin curtains to allow for fresh\r\nair to enter, and for foul air to pass out. These should not be cut\r\nup too high, but start at least a foot below the roof, and have the\r\nwindow lights extend at least half way down the front of the house. The\r\ncurtains should extend quite a bit further down to the bottom of the\r\nhouse, to allow the foul air sufficient opportunity to escape.\r\n\r\nWe should next examine the other walls and roof to make sure that they\r\nare not drafty, nor leak water. Usually these walls can be patched\r\nup with other boards, or heavy roofing paper, so that no draft is\r\npossible. In northern climates, where weather below zero is common,\r\nbest results will be obtained by having two thicknesses of walls, to\r\nprotect against cold nights. Roofing paper is excellent to put between\r\nthe two walls, or even on the outside to aid in this matter. If the\r\nroof leaks, it might be advisable to re-shingle part of it, and here\r\nagain roofing paper helps in making it weather tight.\r\n\r\nWe must next examine the floor. If a wooden floor, then it is advisable\r\nto raise the house up from the ground about six inches, supporting it\r\nwith posts. Some people follow the plan of placing old tin pans or\r\nplates upside down at the top of these posts and then setting the house\r\non, thereby eliminating the danger of rats, as the rats cannot climb\r\nover the tin pans. If the house is to be a permanent structure it will\r\nbe found best to lay a concrete floor, as this floor will last for all\r\ntime, and will not need repairing. Such a floor is rat proof, but must\r\nbe covered with a good litter.\r\n\r\nIf a new house is to be constructed, then it will be best to follow\r\nthe principles laid down for a remodeled house to the extent of the\r\nopen front, weather tight walls and roof, good floor, and dry living\r\nconditions. Wood is the most popular material that is used in building\r\nchicken houses. Generally, 2 by 4s placed about two feet apart are\r\nused for studding. Matched lumber or rough lumber aided by battens or\r\nroofing paper compose the walls, this making them free from drafts. The\r\nmatched lumber is generally placed on the studding horizontally. The\r\nlumber should be dry and free from knot holes, and well nailed together.\r\n\r\nFor the roof, shingles can be used, or some of the prepared roofing\r\npaper on the market now has given good results. For quite flat roofs,\r\ntwo or three ply roofing paper is preferred to the shingles.\r\n\r\nWe will now discuss the common types of poultry houses. The most\r\npopular type and the cheapest, is the shed roof house. This house is\r\nusually about eight feet high in front, slanting gradually to the rear\r\nto a height of about five feet. It just has one slant, and, as has been\r\nsaid, is cheaper to build than other types of houses. It is also much\r\neasier to keep warm in the winter, because of the low roof, which means\r\nless space has to be heated by the birds. Instead of curtain front\r\nhouses in such a type of poultry house, many poultry men are using\r\nbafflers to let in the air. These bafflers are similar to a blind used\r\nto shade living houses in some parts of the country. They are composed\r\nof slats less than an inch apart, and placed in a slanting position,\r\nrather than vertical or horizontal.\r\n\r\nThe gable roof house is another popular type. This differs from the\r\nshed roof type of house in that its roof comes to a peak, with two\r\npitches, such as most modern bungalow dwelling houses have. This system\r\nleaves a larger space at the top of the house, and is not as warm as\r\nthe shed roof type. It also costs more to build. However, it possesses\r\nthe advantage of allowing a straw loft to be placed at the top of the\r\nhouse, which is an excellent way to get rid of excess moisture, when\r\nit can be expelled no other way. The straw has the power to absorb the\r\nexcess moisture during the winter, but should be removed in the spring,\r\nas it furnishes an excellent hiding place for mites, an insect that we\r\nwill discuss more thoroughly in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nThe half monitor type is not so popular as the two types already named,\r\nand costs considerably more than either of the two previous types\r\ndiscussed. This type of house has an arrangement similar to two shed\r\nroof houses, facing each other, the rear house being somewhat higher\r\nthan the front house. Of course, such houses have their advantages, but\r\nfor the one who would start with moderation in the poultry business,\r\nthe shed roof, or the gable roof type will be far more attractive.\r\nWe have discussed the types of houses in this chapter. The fixtures,\r\nor chicken furniture, has so far been omitted. Let us go inside of\r\nour modern chicken house now, and see what is needed in the line of\r\nequipment to complete our efficient egg production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nINTERIOR FIXTURES FOR THE LAYING HOUSES\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are certain devices that save a great deal of labor for the\r\npoultry man, and also give the birds a more contented atmosphere. We\r\nwill start in with the floor. I want to repeat here, briefly, what has\r\nalready been said in regard to the litter on the floor of the house.\r\nBirds with cold feet cannot be healthy. If the floor is covered with a\r\nsix-inch litter of straw, or shavings, the floor will be warm, and they\r\ncan be given a scratching ration that will make them exercise for their\r\nfood. By all means do not fail to have a good litter of some kind on\r\nthe floor during the late fall and winter months.\r\n\r\nThe birds are rather peculiar creatures, when it comes to retiring for\r\nthe night. They do not seek a place to lay down, but they look for\r\nsomething that will resemble a limb of a tree, where they can perch\r\nduring the night. Man has therefore supplied something along this\r\nline, by erecting round poles, made of wood, so that the birds will\r\nhave a convenient place to rest for the night. A few precautions must\r\nbe guarded against here, however, as very few poultry men have given\r\ntheir birds suitable perches yet. The perches should be round, about\r\ntwo inches in diameter, and erected on the same level with each other.\r\nToo many perches are arranged in a ladder formation, having the rear\r\nperch the highest, and the front perch the lowest. When the birds get\r\nready to go to roost, there is always an argument as to which bird\r\nwill have the rear roost, as they all want the highest place to roost,\r\nor perch. If the perches are all on the same level, then there is no\r\npreference, and things are more peaceful at roosting time. We should\r\nplan on allowing about ten inches per bird for perching room. Plan to\r\nhave a distance of about fourteen inches between each perch, or pole.\r\nArrange these perches at the rear of the house, running parallel with\r\nthe rear wall.\r\n\r\nAll modern poultry men have what is known as a dropping board under the\r\nperches, so that the droppings will not fall in the scratching litter\r\nand soil this part of the scratching area. These dropping boards are\r\nusually placed about six inches under the perches, and extend as far\r\nforward as the perches do. This makes the job of cleaning the poultry\r\nhouse quite a simple operation. It is advisable to sprinkle some sand\r\nover the dropping boards to absorb the moisture and bad odor.\r\n\r\nWe have to give the birds a comfortable, well secluded place to lay\r\ntheir eggs. This is sometimes done by placing the nests, or the part\r\nfacing the front wall, covered over with a board, that can be raised\r\nby means of a hinge, when collecting the eggs. The hen can be made to\r\nenter the nest from the rear, and if conditions are so that the nest\r\nis darkened, then the hen will prefer this place to any other place in\r\nthe house. Nests can also be placed along the front wall, underneath\r\nthe windows, or on either side of the house. However, up to the present\r\ntime, below the dropping boards seems to be the most popular place for\r\nthe nests with most poultry men.\r\n\r\nEvery poultry house should have a dust box. This is a box partially\r\nfilled with dust or fine soil, and placed in the front part of the\r\nhouse, so that it will be in the sunlight. The birds appreciate such a\r\ndevice, and will use it generously, as this aids them in fighting off\r\ninsects that prey upon them.\r\n\r\nSuitable containers for food and water should be provided, and kept\r\nclean. The drinking fountains are of various designs, and one can\r\nbuy these very cheaply. They are usually jars or cans inverted, so\r\nthat the water will come out in a small opening at the bottom, just\r\nlarge enough for the bird to stick its head in. The food containers,\r\nfor the dry mash are generally of the hopper kind, having a box-like\r\ncontainer with a trough at the bottom, so that the food falls down into\r\nthe small trough by gravity as the birds consume it. Thus, in a good\r\nsized hopper, a week’s ration of mash can be put in the hopper without\r\nfurther attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nLICE AND MITES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile we have interior fixtures of the poultry house fresh in mind let\r\nus turn our attention briefly to the study of parasites that live on\r\nthe hen, and that are detrimental to her progress. There are quite a\r\nfew various insects that depend upon the hen for their existence, but\r\nfor our purposes we can consider them in a general class of lice and\r\nmites, as the treatment for each class is practically the same.\r\n\r\nLet us first consider the case of lice. These insects live upon the\r\nbody of the hen, eating the flesh, and dead skin as it peels off. They\r\nnever leave the hen, and if conditions are favorable, will lay their\r\neggs on her body, thus multiplying rapidly if precautions are not taken\r\nto look after this matter. It is always well to treat a setting hen for\r\nlice before she is placed on the nest, and then once or twice after she\r\nhas started her job, because these lice will very readily transfer from\r\nthe mother hen to the young chicks, as soon as hatched, and a great\r\nmany chicks die every year from these lice. It is a splendid idea to\r\ngrease all baby chicks, especially those hatched by natural incubation,\r\nwith blue ointment, around the head parts, and wings. The hens can also\r\nbe greased in a similar manner over the whole body.\r\n\r\nHere is where the dust box that we discussed briefly in the previous\r\nchapter comes in, as the birds, wallowing in the box of dust, smother\r\nthe lice, by shaking the dust into the pores of the bird’s body. A\r\nrather recent method of combating lice on birds is now fast gaining\r\nfavor. This is the Sodium Floride treatment. This is best used only on\r\na mild day, however, as the birds are quite wet after their treatment\r\nunder this method. The treatment is usually given as follows: Take an\r\nordinary wash tub, and fill nearly full with not too cold water. For\r\nevery gallon of water in the tub, add one ounce of sodium floride,\r\nobtainable at any drug store. Dip the hen in this solution, tail\r\nfirst, being sure to have a firm grasp on her so she will not splash\r\nthe water over. Dip her in this manner about three times, so that the\r\nsolution comes up in under the feathers. This method has been found\r\nto be very effective. In extreme cases, where the lice are very bad,\r\nanother similar treatment can be given each bird about a month later.\r\nOther good materials to apply to the bird’s body, besides those already\r\nmentioned, are sweet oil, vaseline, and lard.\r\n\r\nNow we come to another pest that is a little harder to get rid of\r\nthan the body lice. The mites, which are so bothersome to most\r\npoultry, have the peculiar habit of staying on the birds only during\r\nthe night, creeping down at daylight to some crack or crevice to hide\r\nuntil darkness again forces the birds to go to roost. These mites are\r\neven more destructive in their work than are the body lice. They are\r\ngenerally found in any crack or crevice about the perches. Here they\r\ncan obscure themselves, and be very close to their prey when ready to\r\nbegin their work at night. While the lice are eating insects, the mites\r\nare sucking insects, and suck the blood of the birds during the night.\r\nWhen the mite is hungry, he is of a yellowish color. When filled up,\r\nhowever, with a good meal of blood, he is red. The mite is very small,\r\nand is similar in construction to a spider.\r\n\r\nIf a flock of chickens are believed to be suffering from mites, and\r\nthere are very few, by the way, that are not troubled with these\r\npests, then it would be advisable first, to whitewash the poultry\r\nhouse thoroughly, not only the roosting quarters, but the walls and\r\nother fixtures inside the house. Kerosene is quite frequently used to\r\nspray the nests with, but has not the lasting power that some of the\r\ncoal tar products possess. Recently, wood preservatives have been used\r\nfor the purposes of ridding the poultry house of mites, and very good\r\nresults have been obtained from this method.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nPOULTRY DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that poultry, living under the artificial\r\nconditions that man has ordained for them, can be entirely free from\r\ndiseases. In fact, very few poultry men can say that they have not had\r\nsome kind of disease affect their flock. Most diseases are contagious,\r\nso it is important to be on the watch for any symptoms of anything out\r\nof the ordinary. Sanitation plays a very important part in keeping the\r\nflock free from diseases, and clean methods should always prevail. Do\r\nnot allow the house to become filthy and foul smelling. It is always a\r\ngood precaution to disinfect the poultry premises at least once a year\r\nwith a good whitewash or some strong disinfectant. This is about the\r\nsame as taking out a life insurance policy for the flock.\r\n\r\nDampness is probably about the most common cause for diseases. Disease\r\ngerms always multiply more rapidly in damp, dark quarters. Therefore\r\nthe advice given in an early chapter about keeping the poultry house\r\nlight and well ventilated, will bear repetition. If one is accustomed\r\nto watching his birds as to their physical condition, he will be able\r\nto notice the symptoms of any on-coming disease in time to isolate the\r\nbird thus affected, before the disease has a chance to spread, if it\r\nis a contagious disease. By watching a bird thus isolated, and also\r\nlooking very carefully for any further symptoms in the flock, one can\r\ndo considerable in checking the disease. The old adage, “An ounce of\r\nprevention is worth a pound of cure,” certainly is true in this case.\r\n\r\nIndigestion is a very common ailment with poultry, especially with\r\nthose birds that are fed heavy for egg production. Usually a little\r\nlaxative material placed in the drinking water, and making more of\r\ntheir ration a scratching ration, in order to induce exercise, is\r\nprobably as simple and effective a treatment as can be given.\r\n\r\nRoup, chicken pox, and canker are also very common poultry diseases.\r\nThese three diseases are all supposed to be due to a small organism\r\nwhich multiply very rapidly, and acts mostly on the skin of the bird.\r\nThese diseases are not similar in appearance, however, despite the fact\r\nthat their source is the same.\r\n\r\nRoup attacks the mucous membrane lining of the nose, and eye. These\r\nparts become red and inflamed, and infected with a pus formation. This\r\ndisease is spread largely through the drinking water, and is prevalent\r\nin the spring when it is damp. Keep the birds healthy and vigorous,\r\nprovide proper ventilation, and have things as dry as possible, and\r\nlittle should be feared from this source.\r\n\r\nChicken pox makes its appearance on the comb and wattles, and also on\r\nthe face of the bird, by small pockets on these parts. The remedy is\r\nthe same in this case as has been stated for roup, except that if only\r\na few birds have contracted the disease, each bird can be taken in hand\r\nand given individual treatment, by removing the crust over the sores,\r\nand applying a good disinfectant.\r\n\r\nCanker manifests itself by pale yellow spots on the inside of the\r\nmouth. This is best treated, as soon as discovered, by scraping off\r\nthis light yellow material, and applying a good disinfectant.\r\n\r\nAll of these last three named diseases are caused by the same\r\nconditions, and by avoiding these conditions very little trouble will\r\nbe experienced in this malady. Birds that have had any of the above\r\nmentioned diseases should never be used for breeding purposes, as their\r\noffspring will have a predisposition to the same ailment.\r\n\r\nSometimes the perches are placed too high in the chicken house, and\r\nthe birds have to jump too far to reach the floor. When this happens,\r\na hard lump often forms on the sole of the foot. This is sometimes\r\ncalled bumble foot, and is usually evident in the chicken’s walk.\r\nNothing but cutting out the hard part, and washing the sore with a good\r\ndisinfectant can remedy this condition.\r\n\r\nWhile frosted combs could not be called a contagious disease, we will\r\ndiscuss this matter briefly, before closing this chapter. In severe\r\nweather, when the temperature is below zero, and there is considerable\r\ndampness in the poultry house, frozen combs are quite frequent. This\r\nis especially true of the lighter birds, which possess larger head\r\nparts than do the heavier breeds. When a bird has its comb or wattles\r\nfrozen, it will stop laying for a considerable period of time, usually\r\na month at least. If birds are found on a cold winter morning with\r\nfrozen combs, they should be treated with snow or cold water, to take\r\nout the frost, and then treated daily with vaseline until cured. It\r\nis well to provide a pole up near the roof of the poultry house, upon\r\nwhich a curtain, made of burlap or some old cloth, is arranged so that\r\non cold winter nights this curtain can be lowered directly in front of\r\nthe front perch. This will tend to protect the birds from the excessive\r\ncold, by conserving the heat given off by their bodies during the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nCULL THE FLOCK\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the poultry industry was being established upon a business\r\nfoundation, many of the leading breeders devised the idea of measuring\r\nthe egg capacity of their birds by actually counting the eggs laid by\r\ntheir best birds. This practice is still followed by many poultry\r\nbreeders, but is a job that consumes considerable time, and it can be\r\nseen that only those who are constantly with the flock could be able\r\nto do this. But within the last few years, there has been developed a\r\nsystem whereby one can tell by the external appearance of the bird just\r\nabout what her ability as an egg producer will be in one year. A Mr.\r\nHogan was the first man to notice these characteristics and his method\r\nhas been so far perfected that most poultry keepers are quite familiar\r\nwith it, and thereby saved the bother of trap-nesting.\r\n\r\nThis culling process, as it is called, is best accomplished during\r\nthe months of August and September. By picking up each female in the\r\nflock at this time, except of course the spring pullets, one can find\r\nout which birds are still laying, and which ones have already quit.\r\nIt has been in the past too much the custom of farmers to go out into\r\ntheir poultry flock in the fall of the year, and pick out the birds\r\nthat had not yet started to moult, and whose appearance was ragged and\r\nrather uncomely. These birds would be picked out by the farmer, or\r\nin many cases his wife, and sent to market as meat birds, and they\r\nwould keep the birds who had already moulted, and whose feathers were\r\nin splendid color at that time. However, in the light of recent facts\r\nbrought out by this culling process, we now know that these rather\r\nragged, unsightly birds were our best layers, and should have been kept\r\nbecause they had been working continuously, not taking the time off to\r\nquit laying and look pretty, as had their more lazy companions. There\r\nare still a great number of people that cling to the old method, but\r\nthe light is dawning, and it will probably be but a short while before\r\npractically everyone interested in poultry will know of this culling\r\nmethod, and who can in a brief examination of a bird tell quite readily\r\nwhether she should be kept or sold.\r\n\r\nWe will now discuss the various methods by which a bird can be judged\r\nas to her egg laying ability. No one sign can be relied upon, but the\r\ndifferent signs taken together should form the final judgment. One can\r\nusually tell something about the bird by her general habits. The good\r\nlayer is a busy hen. She is happy, singing, and not as afraid of the\r\nattendant as is the loafer. As this hen usually eats more than the\r\nnon-layer, she is usually found busily scratching in the litter for\r\nthe food material with which she makes her eggs. The good layer is\r\nalways the first off the roost in the morning, and the last one to go\r\nto roost at night. Watch out for the timid, crafty hen that stays on\r\nthe outskirts of the flock. She is lazy, inactive, and the quicker she\r\nis sent to the butcher, the better. Another very good aid in forming\r\njudgment as to the ability of the birds, is to go around the roosts at\r\nnight, after the birds have all gone to roost. Feel of their crops. The\r\ngood layer that has been working hard to get together food material for\r\nher eggs will have a full crop, while her lazy companions, that are not\r\nso interested in producing eggs, will have a fairly empty crop at this\r\ntime. Little items such as I have mentioned here will tell considerable\r\nabout the ability of the birds. It is a fact that there are any number\r\nof birds in America that lay only a few dozen eggs per year, but are\r\nkept the year round, because the owner has had no way of knowing the\r\nproducers from the non-producers.\r\n\r\nAs has been already brought out, the heavy layers molt late. Often\r\nthey continue laying up until October and November. If you have hens\r\nnearly naked of feathers in October or November, just rest assured\r\nthat these are your most profitable birds, and that they did not quit\r\nlaying to put on a pretty coat of feathers in the middle of the summer.\r\nYou should mark these birds in some manner, so that you can use them\r\nas breeders for the coming winter, because, if they are mated with a\r\ncockerel, that is the son of a good layer, your strain will be greatly\r\nimproved, because these birds will transmit their laying ability to\r\ntheir offspring.\r\n\r\nA good laying hen will have a long, broad, and deep, rectangular body,\r\nwith top and bottom lines parallel. This large sized body is essential\r\nto the hen, so that she will have sufficient room to digest enough food\r\nto make her eggs. A broad back is also necessary for proper room for\r\nthe reproductive organs that make the egg. The head of the good layer\r\nis always of a healthy appearance. The good layer has a short stubby\r\nbeak, or bill, and gracefully curved, as compared to the long shapeless\r\nbill of the loafer. The eyes are prominent, and stick out similar to a\r\nshoe button, rather than sunken in. The combs and wattles are red, and\r\nnot pale, as in the non-layer.\r\n\r\nThe good layer will not have the bright colored yellow, after she has\r\nbeen laying for a short while, that the loafer will have. This is\r\nbecause she uses this yellow pigment in making the yolk of her eggs,\r\nso that as her laying period proceeds, she becomes more and more faded\r\nin her bill, eye lids, ear lobes, and shanks. Consequently, if some of\r\nyour birds have a faded appearance, don’t condemn them, they are the\r\nhardest workers in your flock. Furthermore, the hen with worn toe-nails\r\nis one that should be kept, because this shows us quite clearly that\r\nshe uses them considerably in scratching for her feed.\r\n\r\nNow let us examine the anatomy of the hen a little more closely so that\r\nwe can get some more evidence for or against the hen in question. One\r\nof the most common ways, nowadays, in picking out the laying hen is to\r\nexamine what is known as the pelvic bones. These are found on either\r\nside of the vent, towards the rear of the body. They are generally\r\ncalled the lay bones by most poultry men. They both mean the same.\r\nNow these bones tell a vivid story. These bones are usually measured\r\nby the fingers, or as to how many fingers can be inserted between the\r\ntwo bones. A poor layer will have a thick, grizzly covering of meat\r\nover the lay, or pelvic bones, and just about the width of one finger\r\ncan be inserted between them. This shows us quickly that she is not\r\na layer. Then, lets compare this poor layer to the good layer. Here\r\nwe find something different. There is just a slight covering over the\r\npelvic bones. The meat is thin and spare. If we feel of the bones, we\r\nfind them quite thin and pliable. We next try to insert as many fingers\r\nbetween the two bones as possible. We will find that we can insert at\r\nleast two fingers, and probably three, if our fingers are not too wide.\r\nThe heavier the hen is laying, the wider the distance between the bones.\r\n\r\nNow, while we have the bird, let us look a little further into this\r\nbird’s conformation. The keel bone, or rear end of the breast bone, can\r\nbe used as one unit, and the lay bones as the other unit of measure.\r\nSee how many fingers you can get between the lay bones and the keel\r\nbone. Even for a small breed you should easily get in the width of\r\nthree fingers, and for a larger breed you should get in the width of\r\nfour fingers. This measures the hen’s capacity for feed.\r\n\r\nThis distance between the lay bones and the keel bone is called the\r\nabdomen. We can tell considerable about the hen by the texture of the\r\nabdomen skin. If the skin is tough, and meaty, we can say right away\r\nthat she is not a good hen, but if the skin is tender, pliable, and\r\nsoft, then we can feel assured that she must be kept in the flock.\r\n\r\nThese are the principal features in selecting the laying hen. If\r\none can get these principles in mind, and go out into his flock and\r\nseparate the hens into two flocks, and keep these two flocks apart for\r\na while, he would discover some interesting things. For instance, cull\r\nout the poor hens and put them in one pen. Possibly you will have the\r\nlargest pen, when you have finished, composed of the poor layers. Keep\r\nthe good hens in another pen separated from the poor ones. Keep feeding\r\nthe same feeds as you had been doing before you separated the flock\r\ninto two pens. Now, for a few weeks, compare the daily egg record of\r\nthe two flocks. You will find that there is about as much difference\r\nas between night and day. Now, to bring the lesson home a little more\r\nforceful, just figure out what it costs you per day to keep these star\r\nboarders, and see if you think culling is a paying proposition. Most\r\nevery agricultural college has a bulletin printed on culling giving\r\nessentially the same information as I have given, but they usually have\r\nquite a few illustrations that will make the procedure a little more\r\nclearer than I have done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nPRESERVING EGGS FOR WINTER\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was deemed advisable to add a few words in this little booklet in\r\nregard to collecting eggs when they are cheap, and storing them away\r\nfor the part of the year when eggs are high priced. During the months\r\nof March, April, May, and June eggs are the cheapest on the market,\r\ndue to the fact that the birds are all laying during these few months,\r\nand consequently, the supply far exceeds the average demand. If we\r\npay fifteen cents for a dozen of eggs in April, or May, and then in\r\nDecember we pay sixty cents or more for the same product, then it can\r\neasily be seen that it is a paying proposition to store some of these\r\ncheap spring eggs for winter use. We will now take up the method of\r\nstoring these spring eggs for our December breakfast.\r\n\r\nTo make this process about 100 per cent efficient, it is best to candle\r\nthe eggs first, before storing them away. This process of candling has\r\nbeen explained in a previous chapter. If the air cell, at the blunt\r\nend of the egg is small, then we may be sure that the egg is of recent\r\norigin. If the contents look clear, and the yolk is not loose, inside\r\nthe shell, then we need have no fears as to the edibility of the egg.\r\nOne very good way, for one not accustomed to candling, is to examine\r\na few in front of the light, and then break a few in a dish, so as\r\nto get the proper relation fixed in mind. If we can secure eggs that\r\nare infertile, we will not have to throw out hardly any eggs in this\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nIn preparing to preserve our eggs for winter, there are several\r\nmethods used by people who follow this practice. Some just pack the\r\neggs in sawdust in a box or barrel, but this method is not always\r\nreliable. There are two standard ways of preserving these eggs. One is\r\nin using waterglass, and the other is the use of lime water solution.\r\nBoth methods are reliable, but the first named method seems to be the\r\nmore popular of the two. In either case, earthen crocks or wooden pails\r\nare the best containers. Neither of these solutions affects them. A\r\nthree gallon container is large enough to preserve ten dozen eggs.\r\nFor this sized container, about six quarts of the solution will be\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nWe will discuss the waterglass method first. Procure the amount of\r\nwaterglass that you will need for this year at a drug store. Use this\r\nat the rate of one pint of waterglass to nine pints of water. Before\r\nmixing the two liquids, boil the water, and let it cool. Then mix the\r\ntwo liquids, in the proportion stated, and place in container. Then add\r\nthe eggs, (about ten dozen to this mixture), and store in a cool place.\r\nBe sure that there is about two or three inches of the solution above\r\nthe eggs, and add a little water occasionally to replace the water lost\r\nby evaporation.\r\n\r\nThe lime solution is mixed a little differently. Slack about two pounds\r\nof quick lime in a small quantity of hot water. After this has slacked,\r\nadd it to about two gallons of water, and then add one pound of salt.\r\nStir this in a thorough manner, and then allow the mixture to settle.\r\nThere will then be found a sediment in the bottom of the solution. Pour\r\noff the clear liquid, and use this as the preservative material. Then\r\nkeep the same as directions given for the waterglass preparation. In\r\nthis manner, one can have table eggs the year round at a reasonable\r\nprice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nSELLING THE PRODUCT\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have discussed the main points to be considered in raising various\r\npoultry products in this little booklet. However, much of our success\r\nin the poultry business will depend on our ability to obtain the top\r\nprices for our products after we have raised them. In fact, this is\r\nthe cry all over the country now among the farming population. The\r\nvarious agricultural agencies that have heretofore spent considerable\r\ntime and effort in teaching the farmer to raise a large quantity of\r\ngood products, have apparently accomplished this result, and now these\r\nsame agencies are trying to organize the farmers into selling their\r\nproducts so that they can receive a higher price for them.\r\n\r\nThe farmer usually has no time to devote to the special marketing of\r\nhis crop, as he is too busy raising farm products, so attempts at\r\nco-operative marketing have been made. There have been many failures\r\nin this method in the past, but now the farmer realizes that this\r\nsystem is really his only salvation, and he is receiving the idea of\r\nco-operation in a better mood than he did in the past. However, for\r\nthe one living in town, with but a small flock of birds, more time\r\ncan usually be devoted to this end of the business, with splendid\r\nreturns. Many town lot poultry keepers can sell all the eggs that they\r\ncan get just around to their neighbors, who are usually glad to pay a\r\nlittle more than the market price for the assurance that the eggs are\r\nstrictly fresh. However, if one has a fairly good yield of winter eggs,\r\nand is not content to sell the eggs to his neighbors at around market\r\nprice, there are other methods that can bring much higher returns.\r\n\r\nSome poultry raisers get in touch with local or neighboring hotels and\r\nrestaurants, and agree to let these parties have their entire output\r\nof eggs at a certain margin above market price. For instance, it is\r\na common method to make an agreement with such parties to sell them\r\ntheir eggs at ten cents above market prices. If the market quotations\r\nfor fresh eggs were thirty-two cents for a certain day, the hotel\r\nkeeper would pay forty-two cents, if the eggs were delivered on this\r\nday. Usually, the restaurant or hotel is glad to pay this premium over\r\nthe market price, because he takes quite a chance with store eggs, in\r\nthat some of them are often stale, and this is a matter that reflects\r\nagainst his business. Also, if such an agreement can be made, the hotel\r\nor restaurant man can advertise the fact that he serves nothing but\r\nfresh eggs, which is good business for him.\r\n\r\nWhen one is getting a big yield daily, he can usually plan to sell\r\nhis eggs by the case to city commission men, who will always pay a\r\ngood premium over local markets. If one has not enough eggs to sell a\r\ncase once or twice weekly in such a manner, this difficulty is often\r\novercome by combining with neighbors who are willing to take the proper\r\ncare in producing clean, fresh eggs for market. However, such neighbors\r\nmust be in sympathy with what is expected for fresh eggs, and who have\r\nthe courage to refrain from putting in eggs that are not clean and\r\nfresh. If one case is sent in to these commission men and the quality\r\nof the eggs is not of first class, quite a dockage will be deducted\r\nfrom the check, and your reputation will thereby suffer. Never wash\r\neggs that are soiled, but use them in your own kitchen, as the washing\r\nwill remove the natural bloom, or fine powder that is found on the\r\nuntouched egg. One can secure clean eggs by keeping the bedding in the\r\nnests clean.\r\n\r\nThere is always a splendid opportunity to sell hatching eggs in the\r\nspring of the year, if one has had the foresight to get started in\r\npurebred poultry. There is always a large demand for hatching eggs\r\nand most hatcheries can not fill their orders. For the one engaged in\r\nthe poultry business, even on a small scale, this offers a splendid\r\nopportunity, especially when eggs are selling cheap on the market, as\r\nthey do in the spring of the year, to divide the mature birds up into\r\nsmall pens of about ten females to one good male bird, and sell these\r\neggs at anywhere from $1.50 a setting to as much as you can get. The\r\nhigher the quality of the stock, the more money one can demand for such\r\nhatching eggs.\r\n\r\nThen there is another good source of revenue from selling adult birds\r\nfor breeding purposes. If your flock is composed of good individuals,\r\nyou should experience little difficulty in selling your surplus\r\nbirds from $5 up. A little well planned advertising is often a good\r\nthing to do, to let people know what you have got for sale. Often an\r\nadvertisement in the local paper, or a rural weekly will bring in many\r\ninquiries in regard to the birds or eggs that you have to sell.\r\n\r\nProbably a cheaper way of advertising, if you really have good birds,\r\nis to show a pen, consisting of four females and one male, at some of\r\nthe neighboring poultry shows. If you can succeed in winning a premium,\r\nthis will be a splendid factor in your efforts in selling breeding\r\nstock. It is usually permissible to place a little card on the outside\r\nof your pen at the poultry show, giving your name and address, and\r\nstating that you have breeding stock for sale, or that you are now\r\ntaking orders for hatching eggs in the spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nIN CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nI have tried to explain in this little booklet that there is a splendid\r\nopportunity for one to engage in the poultry industry, whether it be\r\non a large scale, or a small scale. There is considerable pleasure as\r\nwell as profit in this work, for the one that is posted on a few of the\r\nessential principles, as has been laid down in this short treatise. It\r\nwill probably be well to repeat a few facts that should be remembered\r\nfirst, however, before closing.\r\n\r\nDo not expect to make a great amount of money from your poultry the\r\nfirst year. Getting started right in the poultry business will cost\r\nsomething, so for the first year, if you just break even you will\r\ndo well. Plan to learn as you go along. Every poultry raiser should\r\ntake at least one poultry journal, to keep posted on the latest facts\r\nconcerning the business. These journals always carry a great amount of\r\nadvertising matter in regard to stock for breeding and in regard to\r\npoultry house equipment, etc. Many useful ideas can be secured from\r\npretty near every issue of a standard paper.\r\n\r\nGet acquainted with the other poultry people in your own locality. This\r\nis especially true in regard to those who have the same breed that you\r\nhave. If your locality boasts of a poultry association, become a member\r\nof this association. You can then get much valuable information in\r\nregard to your business.\r\n\r\nGet in touch with your state agricultural college, and especially with\r\nthe poultry department. Write to them and ask them to send you all\r\nthe bulletins that they have published on poultry, and tell them to\r\nplace you on their mailing list, so that any future bulletins that\r\nthey may publish will be sent you free of charge. Then the U. S. Dept.\r\nof Agriculture has many excellent bulletins on different branches\r\nof the poultry industry that are worth sending for. It is located\r\nat Washington, D. C. Another splendid thing, if you can succeed in\r\ninteresting others in your community, would be to send to the Motion\r\nPicture Lab., U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, Wash., D. C., and have them\r\nsend you their film on culling, entitled, “Select the Laying Hen.” It\r\ncertainly brings out in a splendid manner, just how to cull your flock.\r\nMost any moving picture house would be glad to run this reel free of\r\ncharge. The only expense of securing this film is the transportation\r\ncharges from Washington, D. C., to your home town.\r\n\r\nWith these parting words on the betterment of your flock, remember that\r\npoultry work has its ups and downs, like any other business. However,\r\nfor one willing to inform himself on the business, a very pleasurable\r\nand profitable experience may be anticipated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe books listed below are in cloth binding and can be secured from\r\nHaldeman-Julius Company, Clothbound Book Department, Girard, Kansas.\r\nThe prices quoted include carriage charges.\r\n\r\nSuccess With Hens, Robert Joos.
