Huxley\r\n\r\n[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE subject upon which I wish to address you to-night is the structure\r\nand origin of Coral and Coral Reefs. Under the head of \"coral\" there are\r\nincluded two very different things; one of them is that substance which\r\nI imagine a great number of us have champed when we were very much\r\nyounger than we are now,--the common red coral, which is used so much,\r\nas you know, for the edification and the delectation of children of\r\ntender years, and is also employed for the purposes of ornament for\r\nthose who are much older, and as some think might know better. The other\r\nkind of coral is a very different substance; it may for distinction's\r\nsake be called the white coral; it is a material which most assuredly\r\nnot the hardest-hearted of baby farmers would give to a baby to chew,\r\nand it is a substance which is to be seen only in the cabinets of\r\ncurious persons, or in museums, or, may be, over the mantelpieces of\r\nsea-faring men. But although the red coral, as I have mentioned to you,\r\nhas access to the very best society; and although the white coral is\r\ncomparatively a despised product, yet in this, as in many other cases,\r\nthe humbler thing is in reality the greater; the amount of work which is\r\ndone in the world by the white coral being absolutely infinite compared\r\nwith that effected by its delicate and pampered namesake. Each of these\r\nsubstances, the white coral and the red, however, has a relationship to\r\nthe other. They are, in a zoological sense, cousins, each of them being\r\nformed by the same kind of animals in what is substantially the same\r\nway. Each of these bodies is, in fact, the hard skeleton of a very\r\ncurious and a very simple animal, more comparable to the bones of such\r\nanimals as ourselves than to the shells of oysters or creatures of that\r\nkind; for it is the hardening of the internal tissue of the creature, of\r\nits internal substance, by the deposit in the body of a material which\r\nis exceedingly common, not only in fresh but in sea water, and which\r\nis specially abundant in those waters which we know as \"hard,\"\r\nthose waters, for example, which leave a \"fur\" upon the bottom of a\r\ntea-kettle. This \"fur\" is carbonate of lime, the same sort of substance\r\nas limestone and chalk. That material is contained in solution in sea\r\nwater, and it is out of the sea water in which these coral creatures\r\nlive that they get the lime which is needed for the forming of their\r\nhard skeleton.\r\n\r\nBut now what manner of creatures are these which form these hard\r\nskeletons? I dare say that in these days of keeping aquaria, of\r\nlocomotion to the sea-side, most of those whom I am addressing may have\r\nseen one of those creatures which used to be known as the \"sea anemone,\"\r\nreceiving that name on account of its general resemblance, in a rough\r\nsort of way, to the flower which is known as the \"anemone\"; but being\r\na thing which lives in the sea, it was qualified as the \"sea anemone.\"\r\nWell, then, you must suppose a body shaped like a short cylinder, the\r\ntop cut off, and in the top a hole rather oval than round. All round\r\nthis aperture, which is the mouth, imagine that there are placed a\r\nnumber of feelers forming a circle. The cavity of the mouth leads into\r\na sort of stomach, which is very unlike those of the higher animals,\r\nin the circumstance that it opens at the lower end into a cavity of the\r\nbody, and all the digested matter, converted into nourishment, is thus\r\ndistributed through the rest of the body. That is the general structure\r\nof one of these sea anemones. If you touch it it contracts immediately\r\ninto a heap. It looks at first quite like a flower in the sea, but if\r\nyou touch it you find that it exhibits all the peculiarities of a living\r\nanimal; and if anything which can serve as its prey comes near its\r\ntentacles, it closes them round it and sucks the material into its\r\nstomach and there digests it and turns it to the account of its own\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nThese creatures are very voracious, and not at all particular what they\r\nseize; and sometimes it may be that they lay hold of a shellfish which\r\nis far too big to be packed into that interior cavity, and, of course,\r\nin any ordinary animal a proceeding of this kind would give rise to a\r\nvery severe fit of indigestion. But this is by no means the case in the\r\nsea anemone, because when digestive difficulties of this kind arise he\r\ngets out of them by splitting himself in two; and then each half builds\r\nitself up into a fresh creature, and you have two polypes where there\r\nwas previously one, and the bone which stuck in the way lying between\r\nthem! Not only can these creatures multiply in this fashion, but they\r\ncan multiply by buds. A bud will grow out of the side of the body (I am\r\nnot speaking of the common sea anemone, but of allied creatures) just\r\nlike the bud of a plant, and that will fashion itself into a creature\r\njust like the parent. There are some of them in which these buds remain\r\nconnected together, and you will soon see what would be the result of\r\nthat. If I make a bud grow out here, and another on the opposite side,\r\nand each fashions itself into a new polype, the practical effect will be\r\nthat before long you will see a single polype converted into a sort of\r\ntree or bush of polypes. And these will all remain associated together,\r\nlike a kind of co-operative store, which is a thing I believe you\r\nunderstand very well here,--each mouth will help to feed the body and\r\neach part of the body help to support the multifarious mouths. I think\r\nthat is as good an example of a zoological co-operative store as you can\r\nwell have. Such are these wonderful creatures. But they are capable not\r\nonly of multiplying in this way, but in other ways, by having a more\r\nordinary and regular kind of offspring. Little eggs are hatched and the\r\nyoung are passed out by the way of the mouth, and they go swimming\r\nabout as little oval bodies covered with a very curious kind of hairlike\r\nprocesses. Each of these processes is capable of striking water like an\r\noar; and the consequence is that the young creature is propelled through\r\nthe water. So that you have the young polype floating about in this\r\nfashion, covered by its 'vibratile cilia', as these long filaments,\r\nwhich are capable of vibration are termed. And thus, although the polype\r\nitself may be a fixed creature unable to move about, it is able to\r\nspread its offspring over great areas. For these creatures not only\r\npropel themselves, but while swimming about in the sea for many hours,\r\nor perhaps days, it will be obvious that they must be carried hither and\r\nthither by the currents of the sea, which not unfrequently move at the\r\nrate of one or two miles an hour. Thus, in the course of a few days,\r\nthe offspring of this stationary creature may be carried to a very great\r\ndistance from its parent; and having been so carried it loses these\r\norgans by which it is propelled, and settles down upon the bottom of the\r\nsea and grows up again into the form and condition of its parents. So\r\nthat if you suppose a single polype of this kind settled upon the bottom\r\nof the sea, it may by these various methods--that is to say, by cutting\r\nitself in two, which we call \"fission,\" or by budding; or by sending out\r\nthese swimming embryos,--multiply itself to an enormous extent, and\r\ngive rise to thousands, or millions, of progeny in a comparatively short\r\ntime; and these thousands, or millions, of progeny may cover a very\r\nlarge surface of the sea bottom; in fact, you will readily perceive\r\nthat, give them time, and there is no limit to the surface which they\r\nmay cover.\r\n\r\nHaving understood thus far the general nature of these polypes, which\r\nare the fabricators both of the red and white coral, let us consider a\r\nlittle more particularly how the skeletons of the red coral and of\r\nthe white coral are formed. The red coral polype perches upon the sea\r\nbottom, it then grows up into a sort of stem, and out of that stem there\r\ngrow branches, each of which has its own polypes; and thus you have a\r\nkind of tree formed, every branch of the tree terminated by its polype.\r\nIt is a tree, but at the end of the branches there are open mouths of\r\npolypes instead of flowers. Thus there is a common soft body connecting\r\nthe whole, and as it grows up the soft body deposits in its interior a\r\nquantity of carbonate of lime, which acquires a beautiful red or flesh\r\ncolour, and forms a kind of stem running through the whole, and it is\r\nthat stem which is the red coral. The red coral grows principally at\r\nthe bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, at very great depths, and the coral\r\nfishers, who are very adventurous seamen, take their drag nets, of a\r\npeculiar kind, roughly made, but efficient for their purpose, and drag\r\nthem along the bottom of the sea to catch the branches of the red coral,\r\nwhich become entangled and are thus brought up to the surface. They are\r\nthen allowed to putrefy, in order to get rid of the animal matter, and\r\nthe red coral is the skeleton that is left.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the white coral, the skeleton is more complete. In the\r\nred coral, the skeleton belongs to the whole; in the white coral there\r\nis a special skeleton for every one of these polypes in addition to that\r\nfor the whole body. There is a skeleton formed in the body of each of\r\nthem, like a cup divided by a number of radiating partitions towards the\r\noutside; and that cup is formed of carbonate of lime, only not stained\r\nred, as in the case of the red coral. And all these cups are joined\r\ntogether into a common branch, the result of which is the formation of\r\na beautiful coral tree. This is a great mass of madrepore, and in the\r\nliving state every one of the ends of these branches was terminated by\r\na beautiful little polype, like a sea anemone, and all the skeleton\r\nwas covered by a soft body which united the polypes together. You must\r\nunderstand that all this skeleton has been formed in the interior of the\r\nbody, to suit the branched body of the polype mass, and that it is as\r\nmuch its skeleton as our own bones are our skeleton. In this next coral\r\nthe creature which has formed the skeleton has divided itself as it\r\ngrew, and consequently has formed a great expansion; but scattered\r\nall over this surface there were polype bodies like those I previously\r\ndescribed. Again, when this great cup was alive, the whole surface was\r\ncovered with a beautiful body upon which were set innumerable small\r\npolype flowers, if we may so call them, often brilliantly coloured;\r\nand the whole cup was built up in the same fashion by the deposit of\r\ncarbonate of lime in the interior of the combined polype body, formed\r\nby budding and by fission in the way I described. You will perceive that\r\nthere is no necessary limit to this process. There is no reason why we\r\nshould not have coral three or four times as big; and there are certain\r\ncreatures of this kind that do fabricate very large masses, or half\r\nspheres several feet in diameter. Thus the activity of these animals\r\nin separating carbonate of lime from the sea and building it up into\r\ndefinite shapes is very considerable indeed.\r\n\r\nNow I think I have said sufficient--as much as I can without taking you\r\ninto technical details, of the general nature of these creatures which\r\nform coral. The animals which form coral are scattered over the seas of\r\nall countries in the world. The red coral is comparatively limited, but\r\nthe polypes which form the white coral are widely scattered. There\r\nare some of them which remain single, or which give rise to only small\r\naccumulations; and the skeletons of these, as they die, accumulate upon\r\nthe bottom of the sea, but they do not come to much; they are washed\r\nabout and do not adhere together, but become mixed up with the mud of\r\nthe sea. But there are certain parts of the world in which the coral\r\npolypes which live and grow are of a kind which remain, adhere together,\r\nand form great masses. They differ from the ordinary polypes just in\r\nthe same way as those plants which form a peat-bog or meadow-turf differ\r\nfrom ordinary plants. They have a habit of growing together in masses\r\nin the same place; they are what we call \"gregarious\" things; and the\r\nconsequence of this is, that as they die and leave their skeletons,\r\nthose skeletons form a considerable solid aggregation at the bottom\r\nof the sea, and other polypes perch upon them, and begin building upon\r\nthem, and so by degrees a great mass is formed. And just as we know\r\nthere are some ancient cities in which you have a British city, and over\r\nthat the foundations of a Roman city; and over that a Saxon city, and\r\nover that again a modern city, so in these localities of which I am\r\nspeaking, you have the accumulations of the foundations of the houses,\r\nif I may use the term, of nation after nation of these coral polypes;\r\nand these accumulations may cover a very considerable space, and may\r\nrise in the course of time from the bottom to the surface of the sea.\r\n\r\nMariners have a name which they apply to all sorts of obstacles\r\nconsisting of hard and rocky matter which comes in their way in the\r\ncourse of their navigation; they call such obstacles \"reefs,\" and they\r\nhave long been in the habit of calling the particular kind of reef,\r\nwhich is formed by the accumulation of the skeletons of dead corals, by\r\nthe name of \"coral reefs,\" therefore, those parts of the world in which\r\nthese accumulations occur have been termed by them \"coral reef areas,\"\r\nor regions in which coral reefs are found. There is a very notable\r\nexample of a simple coral reef about the island of Mauritius, which I\r\ndare say you all know, lies in the middle of the Indian Ocean. It is a\r\nvery considerable and beautiful island, and is surrounded on all sides\r\nby a mass of coral, which has been formed in the way I have described;\r\nso that if you could get upon the top of one of the peaks of the island,\r\nand look down upon the Indian Ocean, you would see that the beach round\r\nthe Island was continued outward by a kind of shallow terrace, which\r\nis covered by the sea, and where the sea is quite shallow; and at a\r\ndistance varying from three-quarters of a mile to a mile and a half from\r\nthe proper beach, you would see a line of foam or surf which looks most\r\nbeautiful in contrast with the bright green water in the inside, and the\r\ndeep blue of the sea beyond. That line of surf indicates the point at\r\nwhich the waters of the ocean are breaking upon the coral reef which\r\nsurrounds the island. You see it sweep round the island upon all sides,\r\nexcept where a river may chance to come down, and that always makes a\r\ngap in the shore.\r\n\r\nThere are two or three points which I wish to bring clearly before your\r\nnotice about such a reef as this. In the first place, you perceive\r\nit forms a kind of fringe round the island, and is therefore called a\r\n\"fringing reef.\" In the next place, if you go out in a boat, and take\r\nsoundings at the edge of the reef, you find that the depth of the water\r\nis not more than from 20 to 25 fathoms--that is about 120 to 150 feet.\r\nOutside that point you come to the natural sea bottom; but all inside\r\nthat depth is coral, built up from the bottom by the accumulation of the\r\nskeletons of innumerable generations of coral polypes. So that you see\r\nthe coral forms a very considerable rampart round the island. What the\r\nexact circumference may be I do not remember, but it cannot be less than\r\n100 miles, and the outward height of this wall of coral rock nowhere\r\namounts to less than about 100 or 150 feet.\r\n\r\nWhen the outward face of the reef is examined, you find that the upper\r\nedge, which is exposed to the wash of the sea, and all the seaward face,\r\nis covered with those living plant-like flowers which I have described\r\nto you. They are the coral polypes which grow, flourish, and add to the\r\nmass of calcareous matter which already forms the reef. But towards the\r\nlower part of the reef, at a depth of about 120 feet, these creatures\r\nare less active, and fewer of them at work; and at greater depths than\r\nthat you find no living coral polype at all; and it may be laid down\r\nas a rule, derived from very extensive observation, that these\r\nreef-building corals cannot live in a greater depth of water than about\r\n120 to 150 feet. I beg you to recollect that fact, because it is one I\r\nshall have to come back to by and by, and to show to what very curious\r\nconsequences that rule leads. Well then, coming back to the margin of\r\nthe reef, you find that part of it which lies just within the surf to be\r\ncoated by a very curious plant, a sort of seaweed, which contains in its\r\nsubstance a very great deal of carbonate of lime, and looks almost like\r\nrock; this is what is called the nulli pore. More towards the land,\r\nwe come to the shallow water upon the inside of the reef, which has\r\na particular name, derived from the Spanish or the Portuguese--it is\r\ncalled a \"lagoon,\" or lake. In this lagoon there is comparatively little\r\nliving coral; the bottom of it is formed of coral mud. If we pounded\r\nthis coral in water, it would be converted into calcareous mud, and the\r\nwaves during storms do for the coral skeletons exactly what we might do\r\nfor this coral in a mortar; the waves tear off great fragments and\r\ncrush them with prodigious force, until they are ground into the merest\r\npowder, and that powder is washed into the interior of the lagoon, and\r\nforms a muddy coating at the bottom. Beside that there are a great many\r\nanimals that prey upon the coral--fishes, worms, and creatures of that\r\nkind, and all these, by their digestive processes, reduce the coral to\r\nthe same state, and contribute a very important element to this fine\r\nmud. The living coral found in the lagoon, is not the reef building\r\ncoral; it does not give rise to the same massive skeletons. As you go\r\nin a boat over these shallow pools, you see these beautiful things,\r\ncoloured red, blue, green, and all colours, building their houses;\r\nbut these are mere tenements, and not to be compared in magnitude\r\nand importance to the masses which are built by the reef-builders\r\nthemselves. Now such a structure as this is what is termed a \"fringing\r\nreef.\" You meet with fringing reefs of this kind not only in the\r\nMauritius, but in a number of other parts of the world. If these were\r\nthe only reefs to be seen anywhere, the problem of the formation of\r\ncoral reefs would never have been a difficult one. Nothing can be\r\neasier than to understand how there must have been a time when the coral\r\npolypes came and settled on the shores of this island, everywhere within\r\nthe 20 to 25 fathom line, and how, having perched there, they gradually\r\ngrew until they built up the reef.\r\n\r\nBut these are by no means the only sort of coral reefs in the world; on\r\nthe contrary, there are very large areas, not only of the Indian ocean,\r\nbut of the Pacific, in which many many thousands of square miles\r\nare covered either with a peculiar kind of reef, which is called the\r\n\"encircling reef,\" or by a still more curious reef which goes by the\r\nname of the \"atoll.\" There is a very good picture, which Professor\r\nRoscoe has been kind enough to prepare for me, of one of these atolls,\r\nwhich will enable you to form a notion of it as a landscape. You have in\r\nthe foreground the waters of the Pacific. You must fancy yourself in the\r\nmiddle of the great ocean, and you will perceive that there is an almost\r\ncircular island, with a low beach, which is formed entirely of coral\r\nsand; growing upon that beach you have vegetation, which takes, of\r\ncourse, the shape of the circular land; and then, in the interior of the\r\ncircle, there is a pool of water, which is not very deep--probably in\r\nthis case not more than eight or nine fathoms--and which forms a strange\r\nand beautiful contrast to the deep blue water outside. This circular\r\nisland, or atoll, with a lagoon in the middle, is not a complete circle;\r\nupon one side of it there is a break, exactly like the entrance into a\r\ndock; and, as a matter of course, these circular islets, or atolls, form\r\nmost efficient break-waters, for if you can only get inside your ship is\r\nin perfect safety, with admirable anchorage in the interior. If the ship\r\nwere lying within a mile of that beach, the water would be one or\r\ntwo thousand feet deep; therefore, a section of that atoll, with the\r\nsoundings as deep as this all round, would give you the notion of a\r\ngreat cone, cut off at the top, and with a shallow cup in the middle of\r\nit. Now, what a very singular fact this is, that we should have rising\r\nfrom the bottom of the deep ocean a great pyramid, beside which all\r\nhuman pyramids sink into the most utter insignificance! These singular\r\ncoral limestone structures are very beautiful, especially when crowned\r\nwith cocoa-nut trees. There you see the long line of land, covered with\r\nvegetation--cocoa-nut trees--and you have the sea upon the inner and\r\nouter sides, with a vessel very comfortably riding at anchor. That is\r\none of the remarkable forms of reef in the Pacific. Another is a sort of\r\nhalf-way house, between the atoll and the fringing reef; it is what is\r\ncalled an \"encircling reef.\" In this case you see an Island rising out\r\nof the sea, and at two or three miles distance, or more, and separated\r\nby a deep channel, which may be eight to twelve fathoms deep, there is a\r\nreef, which encircles it like a great girdle; and outside that again the\r\nwater is one or two thousand feet deep. I spent three or four years\r\nof my life in cruising about a modification of one of these encircling\r\nreefs, called a \"barrier reef,\" upon the east coast of Australia--one of\r\nthe most wonderful accumulations of coral rock in the world. It is about\r\n1,100 miles long, and varies in width from one or two to many miles.\r\nIt is separated from the coast of Australia by a channel of about 25\r\nfathoms deep; while outside, looking toward America, the water is two or\r\nthree thousand feet deep at a mile from the edge of the reef. This is an\r\naccumulation of limestone rock, built up by corals, to which we have no\r\nparallel anywhere else. Imagine to yourself a heap of this material more\r\nthan one thousand miles long, and several miles wide. That is a\r\nbarrier reef; but a barrier reef is merely as it were a fragment of an\r\nencircling reef running parallel to the coast of a great continent.\r\n\r\nI told you that the polypes which built these reefs were not able to\r\nlive at a greater depth than 20 to 25 fathoms of water; and that is the\r\nreason why the fringing reef goes no farther from the land than it does.\r\nAnd for the same reason, if the Pacific could be laid bare we should\r\nhave a most singular spectacle. There would be a number of mountains\r\nwith truncated tops scattered over it, and those mountains would have an\r\nappearance just the very reverse of that presented by the mountains\r\nwe see on shore. You know that the mountains on shore are covered with\r\nvegetation at their bases, while their tops are barren or covered with\r\nsnow; but these mountains would be perfectly bare at their bases, and\r\nall round their tops they would be covered with a beautiful vegetation\r\nof coral polypes. And not only would this be the case, but we should\r\nfind that for a considerable distance down, all the material of these\r\natoll and encircling reefs was built up of precisely the same coral rock\r\nas the fringing reef. That is to say, you have an enormous mass of coral\r\nrock at a depth below the surface of the water where we know perfectly\r\nwell that the coral animals could not have lived to form it. When\r\nthose two facts were first put together, naturalists were quite as much\r\npuzzled as I daresay you are, at present, to understand how these\r\ntwo seeming contradictions could be reconciled; and all sorts of odd\r\nhypotheses were resorted to. It was supposed that the coral did not\r\nextend so far down, but that there was a great chain of submarine\r\nmountains stretching through the Pacific, and that the coral had grown\r\nupon them. But only fancy what supposition that was, for you would have\r\nto imagine that there was a chain of mountains a thousand miles or more\r\nlong, and that the top of every mountain came within 20 fathoms of the\r\nsurface of the sea, and neither rose above nor sunk beneath that level.\r\nThat is highly improbable: such a chain of mountains was never known.\r\nThen how can you possibly account for the curious circular form of the\r\natolls by any supposition of this kind? I believe there was some one who\r\nimagined that all these mountains were volcanoes, and that the reefs\r\nhad grown round the tops of the craters, so we all stuck fast. I may say\r\n\"we,\" though it was rather before my time. And when we all stick fast,\r\nit is just the use of a man of genius that he comes and shows us the\r\nmeaning of the thing. He generally gives an explanation which is so\r\nridiculously simple that everybody is ashamed that he did not find\r\nit out before; and the way such a discoverer is often rewarded is by\r\nfinding out that some one had made the discovery before him! I do not\r\nmean to say that it was so in this particular instance, because the\r\ngreat man who played the part of Columbus and the egg on this occasion\r\nhad, I believe, always had the full credit which he so well deserves.\r\nThe discoverer of the key to these problems was a man whose name you\r\nknow very well in connection with other matters, and I should not wonder\r\nif some of you have heard it said that he was a superficial kind of\r\nperson who did not know much about the subject on which he writes. He\r\nwas Mr. Darwin, and this brilliant discovery of his was made public\r\nthirty years ago, long before he became the celebrated man he now\r\nis; and it was one of the most singular instances of that astonishing\r\nsagacity which he possesses of drawing consequences by way of deduction\r\nfrom simple principles of natural science--a power which has served him\r\nin good stead on other occasions. Well, Mr. Darwin, looking at these\r\ncurious difficulties and having that sort of knowledge of natural\r\nphenomena in general, without which he could not have made a step\r\ntowards the solution of the problem, said to himself--\"It is perfectly\r\nclear that the coral which forms the base of the atolls and fringing\r\nreefs could not possibly have been formed there if the level of the sea\r\nhas always been exactly where it is now, for we know for certain that\r\nthese polypes cannot build at a greater depth than 20 to 25 fathoms, and\r\nhere we find them at 50 to 100 fathoms.\"\r\n\r\nThat was the first point to make clear. The second point to deal with\r\nwas--if the polypes cannot have built there while the level of the\r\nsea has remained stationary, then one of two things must have\r\nhappened--either the sea has gone up, or the land has gone down.\r\n\r\nThere is no escape from one of these two alternatives. Now the\r\nobjections to the notion of the sea having gone up are very considerable\r\nindeed; for you will readily perceive that the sea could not possibly\r\nhave risen a thousand feet in the Pacific without rising pretty much\r\nthe same distance everywhere else; and if it had risen that height\r\neverywhere else since the reefs began to be formed, the geography of\r\nthe world in general must have been very different indeed, at that time,\r\nfrom what it is now. And we have very good means of knowing that any\r\nsuch rise as this certainly has not taken place in the level of the sea\r\nsince the time that the corals have been building their houses. And so\r\nthe only other alternative was to suppose that the land had gone down,\r\nand at so slow a rate that the corals were able to grow upward as fast\r\nas it went downward. You will see at once that this is the solution of\r\nthe mystery, and nothing can be simpler or more obvious when you come to\r\nthink about it. Suppose we start with a coral sea and put in the middle\r\nof it an island such as the Mauritius. Now let the coral polypes come\r\nand perch on the shore and build a fringing reef, which will stop when\r\nthey come to 20 or 25 fathoms, and you will have a fringing reef like\r\nthat round the island in the illustration. So long as the land remains\r\nstationary, so long as it does not descend so long will that reef be\r\nunable to get any further out, because the moment the polype embryos\r\ntry to get below they die. But now suppose that the land sinks very\r\ngradually indeed. Let it subside by slow degrees, until the mountain\r\npeak, which we have in the middle of it, alone projects beyond the sea\r\nlevel. The fringing reef would be carried down also; but we suppose that\r\nthe sinking is so slow that the coral polypes are able to grow up as\r\nfast as the land is carried down; consequently they will add layer upon\r\nlayer until they form a deep cup, because the inner part of the reef\r\ngrows much more slowly than the outer part. Thus you have the reef\r\nforming a bed thicker upon the flanks of the island; but the edge of the\r\nreef will be very much further out from the land, and the lagoon will be\r\nmany times deeper; in short, your fringing reef will be converted into\r\nan encircling reef. And if, instead of this being an island, it were a\r\ngreat continent like Australia, then you will have the phenomenon of a\r\nbarrier reef which I have described. The barrier reef of Australia\r\nwas originally a fringing reef; the land has gone slowly down; the\r\nconsequence is the lagoon has deepened until its depth is now 25 fathoms\r\nand the corals have grown up at the outer edge until you have that\r\nprodigious accumulation which forms the barrier reef at present. Now let\r\nthis process go on further still; let us take the land a further step\r\ndown, so as to submerge even the peak. The coral, still growing up, will\r\ncover the surface of the land, and you will have an atoll reef; that is\r\nto say, a more or less circular or oval ring of coral rock with a lagoon\r\nin the middle. Thus you see that every peculiarity and phenomenon\r\nof these different forms of coral reef was explained at once by the\r\nsimplest of all possible suppositions, namely, by supposing that the\r\nland has gone down at a rate not greater than that at which the coral\r\npolypes have grown up. You explain a Fringing Reef as a reef which is\r\nformed round land comparatively stationary; an Encircling Reef as one\r\nwhich is formed round land going down; and an Atoll as a reef formed\r\nupon land gone down; and the thing is so simple that a child may\r\nunderstand it when it is once explained.\r\n\r\nBut this would by no means satisfy the conditions of a scientific\r\nhypothesis. No man who is cautious would dream of trusting to an\r\nexplanation of this kind simply because it explained one particular set\r\nof facts. Before you can possibly be safe in dealing with Nature--who is\r\nvery properly made of the feminine gender, on account of the astonishing\r\ntricks which she plays upon her admirers!--I say before you can be safe\r\nin dealing with Nature, you must get two or three kinds of cross proofs,\r\nso as to make sure not only that your hypothesis fits that particular\r\nset of facts, but that it is not contradicted by some other set of facts\r\nwhich is just as clear and certain. And it so happens, that in this case\r\nMr. Darwin supplied the cross proofs as well as the immediate evidence.\r\nYou have all heard of volcanoes, those wonderful vents in the surface of\r\nthe earth out of which pour masses of lava, cinders and ashes, and\r\nthe like. Now, it is a matter of observation and experience that all\r\nvolcanoes are placed in areas in which the surface of the earth is\r\nundergoing elevation, or at any rate is stationary; they are not placed\r\nin parts of the world in which the level of the land is being lowered.\r\nThey are all indications of a great subterranean activity, of a\r\nsomething being pushed up, and therefore naturally the land either gives\r\nway and lets it come through, or else is raised up by its violence. And\r\nso Mr. Darwin, being desirous not to merely put out a flashy hypothesis,\r\nbut to get at the truth of the matter, said to himself, \"If my notion of\r\nthis matter is right, then atolls and encircling reefs, inasmuch as they\r\nare dependent upon subsidence, ought not to be found in company with\r\nvolcanoes; and, 'vice versa', volcanoes ought not to be found in company\r\nwith atolls, but they ought to be found in company with fringing reefs.\"\r\nAnd if you turn to Mr. Darwin's great work upon the coral reefs, you\r\nwill see a very beautiful chart of the world, which he prepared with\r\ngreat pains and labour, showing the distribution on the one hand of the\r\nreefs, and on the other of the volcanoes; you will find that in no case\r\ndoes the atoll accompany the volcano, or the volcano burst up among the\r\natolls. It is most instructive to look at the great area of the Pacific\r\non the map, and see the great masses of atolls forming in one region of\r\nit a most enormous belt, running from north-west to south-east; while\r\nthe volcanoes, which are very numerous in that region, go round the\r\nmargin, so that we can picture the Pacific to ourselves a section of a\r\nkind of very shallow basin--shallow in proportion to its width, with the\r\natolls rising from the bottom of it, and at the margins the volcanoes.\r\nIt is exactly as if you had taken a flat mass and lifted up the edges\r\nof it; the subterranean force which lifted up the edges shows itself\r\nin volcanoes, and as the edges have been raised, the middle part of\r\nthe mass has gone down. In other words, the facts of physical geography\r\nprecisely and exactly correspond with the hypothesis which accounts for\r\nthe infinite varieties of coral reefs.\r\n\r\nOne other point, before I conclude, about this matter. These reefs, as\r\nyou have just perceived, are in a most singular and unexpected manner\r\nindications of physical changes of elevations and depressions going on\r\nupon the surface of the globe. I dare say it may have surprised you to\r\nhear me talk in this familiar sort of way of land going up and down;\r\nbut it is one of the universal lessons of geology that the land is\r\ngoing down and going up, and has been going up and down, in all sorts\r\nof places and to all sorts of distances, through all recorded time.\r\nGeologists would be quite right in maintaining the seeming paradox that\r\nthe stable thing in the world is the fluid sea and the shifting thing is\r\nthe solid land. That may sound a very hard saying at first, but the more\r\nyou look into geology, the more you will see ground for believing that\r\nit is not a mere paradox.\r\n\r\nIn an unexpected manner, again, these reefs afford us not only an\r\nindication of change of place, but they afford an indication of lapse of\r\ntime. The reef is a timekeeper of a very curious character; and you can\r\neasily understand why. The coral polype, like everything else, takes a\r\ncertain time to grow to its full size; it does not do it in a minute;\r\njust as a child takes a certain time to grow into a man so does the\r\nembryo polype take time to grow into a perfect polype and form\r\nits skeleton. Consequently every particle of coral limestone is an\r\nexpression of time. It must have taken a certain time to separate the\r\nlime from the sea water. It is not possible to arrive at an accurate\r\ncomputation of the time it must have taken to form these coral islands,\r\nbecause we lack the necessary data; but we can form a rough calculation,\r\nwhich leads to very curious and striking results. The computations of\r\nthe rate at which corals grow are so exceedingly variable, that we must\r\nallow the widest possible margin for error; and it is better in this\r\ncase to make the allowance upon the side of excess. I think that anybody\r\nwho knows anything about the matter will tell you that I am making a\r\ncomputation far in excess of what is probable, if I say that an inch of\r\ncoral limestone may be added to one of these reefs in the course of\r\na year. I think most naturalists would be inclined to laugh at me for\r\nmaking such an assumption, and would put the growth at certainly not\r\nmore than half that amount. But supposing it is so, what a very curious\r\nnotion of the antiquity of some of these great living pyramids comes out\r\nby a very simple calculation. There is no doubt whatever that the sea\r\nfaces of some of them are fully a thousand feet high, and if you take\r\nthe reckoning of an inch a year, that will give you 12,000 years for the\r\nage of that particular pyramid or cone of coral limestone; 12,000 long\r\nyears have these creatures been labouring in conditions which must have\r\nbeen substantially the same as they are now, otherwise the polypes could\r\nnot have continued their work. But I believe I very much understate both\r\nthe height of some of these masses, and overstate the amount which these\r\nanimals can form in the course of a year; so that you might very safely\r\ndouble the period as the time during which the Pacific Ocean, the\r\ngeneral state of the climate, and the sea, and the temperature has been\r\nsubstantially what it is now; and yet that state of things which now\r\nobtains in the Pacific Ocean is the yesterday of the history of the life\r\nof the globe. Those pyramids of coral rock are built upon a foundation\r\nwhich is itself formed by the deposits which the geologist has to deal\r\nwith. If we go back in time and search through the series of the rocks,\r\nwe find at every age of the world's history which has yet been examined,\r\naccumulations of limestone, many of which have certainly been built\r\nup in just the same way as those coral reefs which are now forming the\r\nbottom of the Pacific Ocean. And even if we turn to the oldest periods\r\nof geologic history, although the nature of the materials is changed,\r\nalthough we cannot apply to them the same reasonings that we can to the\r\nexisting corals, yet still there are vast masses of limestone formed of\r\nnothing else than the accumulations of the skeletons of similar animals,\r\nand testifying that even in those remote periods of the world's history,\r\nas now, the order of things implies that the earth had already endured\r\nfor a period of which our ordinary standards of chronology give us not\r\nthe slightest conception. In other words, the history of these coral\r\nreefs, traced out honestly and carefully, and with the same sort of\r\nreasoning that you would use in the ordinary affairs of life, testifies,\r\nlike every fact that I know of, to the prodigious antiquity of the earth\r\nsince it existed in a condition in the main similar to that in which it\r\nnow is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A Lecture delivered in Manchester, November 4th, 1870.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Coral and Coral Reefs, by Thomas H.
