KING, JR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout history man has sought stones and minerals for personal\r\nadornment and ornamentation. Stones and minerals that are sufficiently\r\nbeautiful, durable, and rare are known as gemstones. A gemstone with\r\nonly one of these qualities is less desirable than one with all three.\r\nFor example, a stone with rich color but not sufficiently durable to\r\nwithstand daily wear in rings finds little favor as a gemstone except in\r\nbrooches or pins where the stone is relatively safe from abrasion.\r\nLikewise, a stone that is beautiful and durable may be of little\r\ninterest as a gemstone because it is commonly found in great quantities.\r\nTo be valued highly, gemstones must be beautiful to the eye, durable\r\nenough to withstand wear, and rare enough so that they are not easily\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Properties of Gemstones\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beauty of gemstones is mostly dependent on their color, diaphaneity,\r\nbrilliancy, luster, and fire. Any one or a combination of these\r\nproperties render stones desirable as gems.\r\n\r\nColor is very important in many gemstones. The color of transparent\r\nvarieties should be distinct enough to be pleasing to the eye, yet not\r\nso dark as to appear black or opaque. It is generally more desirable\r\nthat the gemstone be of even color and not appear “patchy” or\r\n“streaked.” However, some opaque or translucent stones such as agate owe\r\ntheir popularity chiefly to the variety of colors and designs within a\r\nsingle piece. Some transparent gemstones exhibit different colors when\r\nviewed in different directions. For example, some fine blood-red rubies\r\nappear brownish when viewed in a particular direction. The gemstone\r\nshould be cut so that its finest color is most prominently displayed.\r\nThis ability of some gemstones to exhibit different colors when viewed\r\nin different directions is called pleochroism.\r\n\r\nDiaphaneity is the relative ability of stones to transmit light.\r\nDiaphaneity is described by terms such as transparent, translucent, and\r\nopaque. Transparency is highly desirable in stones such as diamond that\r\nare commonly facet-cut to reflect light. The gemstone should be water\r\nclear and free from inclusions and cracks so that it transmits light\r\nfreely, but there are stones that do not exhibit this property that are\r\nprized as gemstones. For example, turquoise may appear to be completely\r\nopaque and not transmit any light, but it is sought for its fine blue\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nThe brilliancy of gemstones is largely dependent on their index of\r\nrefraction. The index of refraction is a measure of the ability of a cut\r\ngemstone to “bend” light rays and reflect them from the bottom facets\r\nback through the top of the stone. Of course, brilliancy is not noted in\r\nopaque or faintly translucent stones. The index of refraction of\r\ngemstones is expressed numerically. Air is the reference medium and is\r\nassigned an index of refraction of 1.00. Other substances are assigned\r\nvalues relative to that of air, for example, water, 1.33; topaz, 1.62;\r\ndiamond, 2.42. The higher the index of refraction, the more brilliant\r\nwill be the gemstone if it is properly cut and polished.\r\n\r\nLuster is the appearance of the mineral on a fresh surface in reflected\r\nlight; it is divided into two major categories, metallic and\r\nnon-metallic. Most gemstones have non-metallic luster and are described\r\nby terms such as vitreous or glassy, resinous, waxy, greasy, and pearly.\r\n\r\nThe fire, or ability of gemstones to show flashes of different colors of\r\nlight, is dependent upon a property called dispersion. The amount of\r\ndispersion is the extent to which the gemstone is able to separate\r\nordinary white light into its component colors. The dispersion of\r\ngemstones can also be expressed numerically but for purposes of this\r\npublication will be referred to as low, moderate, or high. Diamond is a\r\ncommon gemstone that has high dispersion.\r\n\r\nA gemstone’s durability is primarily dependent upon its hardness. The\r\nMohs scale of hardness, given below, is most commonly used for gemstones\r\nand other minerals.\r\n\r\n      _Mohs Scale of Hardness_\r\n  1. Talc\r\n  2. Gypsum\r\n  3. Calcite\r\n  4. Fluorite\r\n  5. Apatite\r\n  6. Orthoclase feldspar\r\n  7. Quartz\r\n  8. Topaz\r\n  9. Corundum\r\n  10. Diamond\r\n\r\nOn this scale, the higher numbers are the harder minerals. Mohs is a\r\nrelative, not an absolute scale. Therefore, it should not be assumed\r\nthat diamond is ten times harder than talc because actually diamond is\r\nvery many tens of times harder than talc. However, a particular mineral\r\nis harder than any other mineral with a lesser number, and the scale is\r\nvery convenient to use. Gemstones mounted in rings should have a\r\nhardness of at least seven on the Mohs scale, or the stones may become\r\nscuffed and scratched after a relatively short period of wear. Gemstones\r\nmounted in pins and brooches can be of softer material as they are not\r\nusually subjected to abrasion and rough treatment.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of some minerals to split with relative ease in particular\r\ndirections along planes is called cleavage. Cleavage is also a factor\r\ndetermining the durability of gemstones. Some gemstones do not exhibit\r\nthis tendency at all, whereas others cleave in several directions. The\r\nnumber of cleavages is always the same in any one mineral, and the\r\ndirection of cleavages is constant in relation to the crystal structure\r\nof any one mineral or gemstone. It is apparent that of stones having the\r\nsame hardness, the ones lacking cleavage or having the lesser number of\r\ngood cleavage directions are the most durable.\r\n\r\nSome stones, such as jade and agate, owe their durability to their\r\ncompact fibrous structure, which makes them very tough and durable even\r\nthough they are not especially hard.\r\n\r\nSeveral other properties of gemstones, although not always contributing\r\nto the beauty or desirability of gemstones, are useful in identifying\r\nuncut specimens.\r\n\r\nStreak is the color of the mineral when finely powdered or, for softer\r\nminerals, the color obtained by rubbing the mineral against a piece of\r\nunglazed porcelain or tile. The color of a mineral’s streak is commonly\r\ndifferent from the unpowdered specimen.\r\n\r\nFracture is the kind of surface obtained when the mineral is broken in a\r\ndirection that is not a cleavage direction. Fracture surfaces are\r\ndescribed by such terms as conchoidal (like the fracture of glass),\r\nsubconchoidal, splintery, even, and uneven.\r\n\r\nTenacity is the resistance of a mineral to breakage. Brittle minerals\r\nbreak relatively easily on impact. Malleable minerals, such as gold, may\r\nbe flattened under a hammer into very thin sheets without breaking.\r\nSectile minerals may be cut with a knife without powdering. Most\r\ngemstones, even diamond, are brittle.\r\n\r\nIt is only natural to value most those gemstones that are not common or\r\neasy to obtain. Emerald owes its longstanding popularity to its fine\r\ngreen color, but tourmaline is sometimes found in colors that very\r\nclosely approach that of emerald and yet sells for considerably less\r\nbecause it is so much more common.\r\n\r\nRarity is not the only factor affecting the value of gemstones. Freedom\r\nfrom internal imperfections, quality of cutting, color, and size must\r\nalso be considered in cut and polished gemstones. Internal\r\nimperfections, such as inclusions and cracks, detract from the\r\nappearance of gemstones and interfere with the passage of light between\r\nthe facets; consequently, gemstones containing these imperfections are\r\nnot valued as highly as those without them. Poor cutting or polishing\r\ndetract from the beauty and thus from the value of gemstones. Unpopular\r\nor poor color commonly causes gemstones to be less valuable. Rich green\r\nemeralds are exceedingly prized, whereas very pale green emeralds are\r\nrelatively inexpensive. Diamonds that have the least hint of yellow are\r\nnever valued as highly as pure colorless, pink, or blue stones. Few\r\npersons find the yellowish color attractive, unless it is a vivid canary\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\nSize is important in determining the value of gemstones but not as\r\nimportant as perfection. A badly flawed gemstone of large size may be\r\nworth only a slight fraction of the value of a smaller perfect one.\r\nGemstone size is usually measured in carats, a unit of weight, although\r\nmillimeter size is sometimes used. Five carats is equal to 1 gram and\r\napproximately 28⅓ grams is equal to 1 ounce avoirdupois. One\r\none-hundredth (0.01) of a carat is called a point, and this term is\r\noften used, especially pertaining to very small gemstones.\r\n\r\nThe term used to compare the relative weights of minerals and gemstones\r\nis specific gravity, which is expressed numerically in relation to\r\nwater. Water is assigned the value of 1.00. Therefore, at a given\r\ntemperature a gemstone having a specific gravity of 2.00 is twice as\r\nheavy as an equal volume of water. A 1-carat sapphire (specific gravity\r\nabout 4.00) will be smaller than a 1-carat amethyst (specific gravity\r\nabout 2.65) because the heavier material will occupy less volume to have\r\nthe same weight.\r\n\r\nA summary of properties helpful in identification of common Texas gem\r\nminerals is given in Table 1.\r\n\r\nComparatively recently in the history of gemstones, man has succeeded in\r\nthe production of synthetic gems that have properties closely\r\napproaching those of many natural gemstones. To the untrained eye some\r\nsynthetic gems may appear identical to natural stones, but synthetic\r\ngems can be detected with little difficulty by a properly equipped\r\nexpert. Although most synthetic gems are inexpensive, their manufacture\r\nhas not adversely affected the value of natural gemstones but instead\r\nhas increased the demand for fine natural gems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Crystals\r\n\r\n\r\nGemstones that have an orderly internal molecular arrangement are\r\nreferred to as crystalline. This internal order is commonly reflected in\r\nthe external shape of “rough” or uncut gemstones. The resultant shape is\r\na polyhedral solid bounded by planes and called a crystal. Well-formed\r\ncrystals are formed in nature only under relatively ideal conditions of\r\ntemperature, pressure, and space. The specific temperatures and\r\npressures involved vary with different minerals, but most crystals need\r\nspace in which to form so that their “growth” is not impaired by\r\nsurrounding rocks and minerals. However, some minerals, such as garnet\r\nand tourmaline, can grow in metamorphic rocks by recrystallization of\r\nminerals in the metamorphic rocks. The size of crystals varies from\r\nmicroscopic to tens of feet. Any one mineral usually has one or two\r\ntypical crystal forms or arrangements of plane surfaces that aid greatly\r\nin the identification of the mineral when it occurs in good crystals\r\n(fig. 1). Frequently gemstones are found as abraded stream-rolled\r\npebbles, fragments, or masses that do not show crystal form. Crystals of\r\nthe same mineral from different locations commonly show somewhat\r\ndifferent crystal forms owing to slight differences in composition or\r\nconditions of formation. Mineralogists and crystallographers classify\r\ncrystals by the symmetry that they exhibit. The crystal systems are (1)\r\nisometric or cubic, (2) tetragonal, (3) hexagonal, (4) orthorhombic, (5)\r\nmonoclinic, and (6) triclinic. A complete description of the\r\nclassification of crystals can be found in almost any mineralogy text\r\n(see Selected References, p. 34).\r\n\r\n               Table 1.

Such gemstones are termed\r\namorphous, or without form. Amorphous gemstones mostly occur in nature\r\nas irregular lumps or masses, cavity fillings, or veins.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 1. Typical crystal form of three common Texas\r\n                              gemstones.]\r\n\r\n  GARNET\r\n  TOURMALINE\r\n  QUARTZ\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   CUTTING AND POLISHING OF GEMSTONES\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two types of widely used gemstone cuts. Opaque or figured\r\ngemstones are usually cut with a rounded upper surface and a flat or\r\nrounded back. A stone cut in this fashion is termed a cabochon or is\r\nsaid to be cabochon cut. There are several variations of this mode of\r\ncutting (fig. 2). Precious opal, agate, jade, star sapphire, and fossil\r\nwood are some of the stones that are cut mostly as cabochons.\r\nTransparent gemstones are usually cut with many plane polished surfaces.\r\nSuch stones are called faceted, and the process of cutting and polishing\r\nthese stones is called faceting. Emerald, diamond, topaz, and garnet are\r\nexamples of gemstones that are commonly seen as faceted stones.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Fig. 2. Variations of the cabochon cut. Left to right:\r\n   double cabochon; flat cabochon; simple cabochon; hollow cabochon.]\r\n\r\nThe cutting of gemstones, although sometimes tedious and time consuming,\r\nis not especially difficult or complex. However, like most arts and\r\ncrafts, technique and ability should improve with practice and\r\nexperience. There are currently many amateur gem cutters in Texas. A\r\ncomplete set of equipment necessary to cut cabochon stones may be\r\npurchased for as little as $50.00 or $60.00. Most amateur cabochon\r\ncutters have equipment that cost less than $100.00 which enables them to\r\ndo very fine work on many gem materials. Facet cutting requires more\r\nprecise equipment, and a complete array of such usually costs more than\r\n$100.00, although less expensive equipment can be obtained. The\r\nbeginning gem cutter or lapidary who is willing to assemble and make\r\nsome of his own equipment can reduce his initial expenses considerably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Cabochon Gems\r\n\r\n\r\nThe procedures listed herein for gem cutting do not apply to all\r\ngemstones. Stones that are especially brittle, soft, or difficult to\r\npolish require additional procedures or special techniques. Many\r\nlapidaries may deviate from these procedures. Some of the steps of\r\ncutting and polishing are merely matters of personal opinion and vary\r\nsomewhat from cutter to cutter. There are several detailed texts on the\r\nart of gem cutting; the descriptions herein are designed to give the\r\nreader only a general idea of the procedures and techniques involved.\r\n\r\nThe cutting and polishing of cabochons require several steps. The\r\ninitial step is sawing. Assuming that the rough gem material is large\r\nenough to be sawed (larger than about half an inch in diameter), it is\r\nclamped into the carriage of a diamond saw (fig. 3) and cut into slices\r\nabout ⅜-inch thick. The blade of the saw is mild steel that has been\r\nimpregnated with diamond dust around the edge, hence the name diamond\r\nsaw. The blade is rotated rapidly, and the material to be cut is “fed”\r\nto the blade by a sliding carriage on which the gem material is clamped.\r\nThe extreme hardness of the diamond dust in the edge of the blade\r\nenables the saw to cut through several inches of gem material in a few\r\nminutes. The lower portion of the saw blade is immersed in a mixture of\r\nkerosene and oil, and the rotating saw blade carries with it some of the\r\nkerosene-oil mixture; this acts as a coolant and lubricant for both the\r\nsaw blade and the material being cut. Without this lubricant, the heat\r\ngenerated by sawing would shatter most gem materials and also damage the\r\nsaw blade. As this “slicing” or sawing of the material usually takes\r\nseveral minutes, a weight and pulley are generally used to give the gem\r\nmaterial the necessary pressure against the saw blade. When cut through,\r\nthe “slab” of gem material falls into the kerosene-oil mixture at the\r\nbottom of the saw or onto a special platform that cushions its fall.\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: Fig. 3. Diamond saw.]\r\n\r\n  Motor\r\n  Clamp\r\n  Diamond-charged blade\r\n  Carriage\r\n  Stone\r\n  Weight\r\n\r\nAfter being sawed, the slab of gem material is examined, and the\r\nlocation and size of the stones to be cut from the slab are determined.\r\nThe desired outline of the shape of the gem to be cut is marked on the\r\nslab with a pointed piece of aluminum rod; ordinary pencil marks are not\r\nused because they wear away too quickly in the cutting process. Once the\r\narea from which the gem is to be cut has been selected and the outline\r\nof the gemstone has been marked on the slab, the excess material is\r\ntrimmed away by a smaller diamond saw known as a trim-saw. In some slabs\r\nthe excess material can be broken and “nibbled” away with a strong pair\r\nof pliers.\r\n\r\nThe remaining portion of the stone is usually held by hand and ground to\r\nthe desired shape using the previously scribed mark as a guide. This is\r\ndone using a relatively coarse-grained (about 150 grit) specially made\r\ncarborundum grinding wheel.\r\n\r\nNow that the desired outline has been obtained, the stone is firmly\r\naffixed to a slender wooden or hollow aluminum dop-stick (fig. 4). The\r\nprocess whereby the stone is attached to the dop-stick with a specially\r\ncompounded jeweler’s wax is called dopping. The dop-wax is heated over\r\nan alcohol lamp or candle flame until it is soft and pliable and is then\r\nspread around on the end of the dop-stick and formed into a mass about\r\nthe right size and shape to fit the back of the gemstone. The stone is\r\nlikewise heated, and the wax is applied to the back of the stone while\r\nboth wax and stone are hot. Upon cooling, the wax firmly fixes the stone\r\nto the dop-stick. The dop-stick allows the lapidary to have firm control\r\nof the stone during all later stages of cutting and polishing.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 4. Cabochon properly attached to dop-stick.]\r\n\r\n  CABOCHON\r\n  DOP-WAX\r\n  DOP-STICK\r\n\r\nThe top of the dopped gemstone is worked against the coarse carborundum\r\ngrinding wheel until it is a rough approximation of the desired shape.\r\nThe stone is then worked against a much finer-grained (about 220 grit)\r\ngrinding wheel to remove the irregularities left by the coarse grinding\r\nand to further smooth and shape the surface of the gemstone. At all\r\ntimes while grinding, a small flow of water should be directed on the\r\ngrinding wheel to keep the stone cool. Grinding on the stone for even a\r\nfew minutes without cooling may result in the shattering of the gemstone\r\nbecause of heat created by friction of the stone against the grinding\r\nwheel. If the lapidary keeps the surface of the grinding wheel wet,\r\nthere is little chance of damaging most gem materials.\r\n\r\nThe next phase of cabochon cutting and polishing is sanding. The\r\ngemstone is worked against two sanding drums of different grit size.\r\nThis sanding can be done with the sandpaper surface either wet or dry,\r\nas needed or as preferred by the lapidary. However, great care should be\r\nexercised during sanding so that the stone is not overheated.\r\nOverheating can easily occur whether the sandpaper is used wet or dry.\r\nAs in grinding, sanding is first done on coarser grit paper (about 300\r\ngrit) and last on finer paper (about 600 grit). It is in the sanding\r\nprocess that the first hint of polish is noted on the surface of the\r\nstone. After sanding, the gemstone should have perfect form with no\r\nsurface irregularities, a very finely textured surface, and only very\r\nminor scratches left from sanding. The gemstone is now ready to be\r\npolished.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 5. Cabochons at various stages of cutting and\r\n polishing. Left to right: trimmed from slab: ground to outline; after\r\n               rough grinding; after sanding; polished.]\r\n\r\nAt this point the procedure depends on the nature of the gemstone being\r\npolished. Most gem materials are worked against a buffing wheel that is\r\nimpregnated or saturated with a mixture of some polishing compound and\r\nwater. A soft felt buffing wheel with cerium oxide as the polishing\r\nagent is used for many materials. The mixture of cerium oxide and water\r\nis usually applied to the buffing wheel with a small brush. The lapidary\r\nshould once more be careful not to overheat the stone. If the stone\r\nbecomes too hot to hold to the underside of the cutter’s wrist, it\r\nshould be permitted to cool for a few seconds before continuing. After\r\npolishing on the buffing wheel, the gemstone should have a fine, high\r\npolish and be free of any scratches or surface irregularities. The\r\nfinished gemstone is removed from the dop-stick by heating the dop-wax\r\nand pulling the stone loose. Any excess wax that hardens again before it\r\ncan be removed from the stone by hand can be dissolved away by rubbing\r\nwith an acetone-soaked cloth. Figure 5 illustrates the desired\r\nappearance of the gemstone at the end of each of the steps of cutting\r\nand polishing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Faceted Gems\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principles involved in faceting are about the same as those in the\r\ncutting of cabochons, but the equipment and technique are considerably\r\ndifferent. The equipment required for the facet cutting of gemstones is\r\nbuilt into or attached to a small specially constructed table (fig. 7),\r\nand the unit is commonly called a facet table. Most faceted gemstones\r\nare cut to obtain the largest flawless stone possible from the rough\r\nmaterial. Therefore, one of the first and most important steps for the\r\nlapidary is to decide how the stone is to be cut from the rough crystal\r\nor pebble. The colors that can be obtained from the gemstone must also\r\nbe considered, and the cutting of the stone oriented so that its best\r\ncolor is displayed. The lapidary also selects the orientation of the\r\nstone in relation to the cleavage or cleavages. It is difficult or\r\nimpossible to polish facets of gemstones that are cut parallel to a good\r\ncleavage direction.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Fig. 6.

The chuck is tightened so\r\nthat the position of the stone on the end of the arm of the facet head\r\nis firmly fixed, and the facet head is adjusted so that the first facet\r\nthat is cut is the horizontal, top facet of the stone or table facet\r\n(fig. 6). The table facet is cut by grinding the gemstone on a flat\r\ncutting lap that is diamond impregnated (fig. 8). By minor adjustments\r\nof the facet head, the lapidary can precisely control the location of\r\nthe table facet. As soon as the table facet has been ground to the\r\nproper size, the cutting lap is removed from the lap plate, and the\r\npolishing lap is secured in place. Many different kinds of polishing\r\nlaps and polishing compounds may be used depending on the properties of\r\nthe material being polished. However, one lap and one polishing compound\r\nare usually sufficient for each gem variety. After the polishing lap is\r\nsecured to the lap plate, the lapidary adjusts the facet head so that\r\nthe stone is in exactly the same position relative to the lap that it\r\nwas during the cutting of the table facet. The polishing lap is run wet\r\nor damp with water, as is the cutting lap, and small amounts of the\r\npolishing compound are applied to the surface of the lap while the facet\r\nis being polished. The minor scratches left by the cutting process are\r\ngradually removed, and a fine lustrous polish develops on the facet. It\r\nis especially important to take care in achieving a perfect polish on\r\nthe table facet, as this facet occupies a large area of the crown of the\r\ngemstone. When the cutting and polishing of the table facet are\r\ncompleted, the gemstone is still rough or uncut in all portions except\r\nfor this single, large, polished surface.\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: Fig. 7.

Grinding the table facet on a rough stone.]\r\n\r\n  CHUCK\r\n  DOP-STICK\r\n  DOP-WAX\r\n  STONE\r\n  LAP\r\n\r\nThe gemstone is then removed from the dop-stick by melting the dop-wax\r\nand is dopped once more so that the plane of the polished table facet is\r\nperpendicular to the axis of the chuck and arm of the facet head (fig.\r\n9). Great care should be taken by the lapidary to insure that the table\r\nof the stone is exactly perpendicular to this axis, or the proper\r\nplacing of the later facets on the stone may become very difficult.\r\n\r\n          [Illustration: Fig. 9. Stone dopped to table facet.]\r\n\r\n  TABLE FACET\r\n  DOP-WAX\r\n  STONE\r\n  DOP-STICK\r\n\r\nOnce the stone has been properly dopped to the table facet, the lapidary\r\nis ready to proceed with the cutting of the outline of the stone. If it\r\nis to be a brilliant cut, the stone is ground perfectly round in\r\noutline; if it is to be an emerald or step cut, it is shaped so that it\r\nis square or rectangular in outline. This process is called preforming.\r\nThe arm of the facet head is lowered on the post until it is horizontal,\r\nand the stone is worked against the cutting lap until the desired shape\r\nis obtained. When the preforming process is completed, the stone should\r\nhave the desired outline of the finished gem (fig. 10).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 10. Preformed stone dopped to table facet.]\r\n\r\n  DOP-WAX\r\n  STONE\r\n  DOP-STICK\r\n\r\nThe lapidary is now ready to proceed with the cutting of the pavilion of\r\nthe stone. The arm of the facet head is raised to the proper angle for\r\ncutting the main pavilion facets. The angle at which the main facets are\r\ncut is very critical in determining the beauty of the finished stone.\r\nThe required angle at which these facets must be cut varies with the\r\nrefractive indices of the different varieties of gem minerals. If the\r\nfacets are not cut at exactly the proper angle, light entering the top\r\nor crown of the gemstone can pass completely through the stone, instead\r\nof being reflected back out of the crown facets. The result is a dull,\r\nlifeless stone that appears to have a “hole” or “fish-eye” in the\r\ncenter. Stones that are cut in this manner are greatly reduced in value.\r\nThe angle at which the facets are cut is controlled by the adjustment of\r\nthe height of the arm of the facet head on the post. The lapidary will\r\ncontinually adjust this height, because the angle between the arm and\r\nthe surface of the lap changes slightly as the facet is ground down to\r\nits proper place and size.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 11. Proper sequence of cutting of the pavilion\r\nfacets. Left to right: four main facets; all eight main facets; half of\r\n            the pavilion girdle facets; completed pavilion.]\r\n\r\nThe standard American brilliant cut will be used as an example of facet\r\ncutting. Procedure for all other cuts is essentially the same to this\r\npoint. After the eight main pavilion facets have been cut, the cutting\r\nangle is changed a few degrees, the arm of the facet head rotated\r\nslightly, and the sixteen pavilion girdle facets or “skill” facets, as\r\nthey are often called, are cut (fig. 11). The pavilion girdle facets\r\nshould meet exactly in the center of the main facets at the girdle of\r\nthe stone. The pavilion girdle facets should neither overlap, nor should\r\nthere be any space between them (fig. 12). After the pavilion girdle\r\nfacets are cut, the cutting of the pavilion of the gemstone is\r\ncompleted. The facets are then polished on the polishing lap at the same\r\nangles and in the same order as they were cut, and the pavilion of the\r\ngem is completely finished.\r\n\r\nThe stone is then removed from the dop-stick by melting the dop-wax and\r\nis re-dopped to the pavilion facets so that the crown of the stone is\r\nnow exposed for cutting. Before the lapidary proceeds with the cutting\r\nof the crown, it is necessary that the stone be perfectly centered on\r\nthe dop-stick and that the plane of the table facet be perpendicular to\r\nthe dop-stick and to the axis of the arm of the facet head. The eight\r\nmain facets are cut first, with numerous adjustments being made by the\r\nlapidary to insure that the proper angle is maintained (fig. 13). Then\r\nthe cutting angle is changed a few degrees, the arm of the facet head\r\nrotated slightly, and the crown girdle facets are cut. The crown girdle\r\nfacets are placed very similarly to the pavilion girdle facets except\r\nthat they are shorter. The crown girdle facets should be joined in\r\nexactly the same way as the pavilion girdle facets. When these facets\r\nare properly cut, the cutting angle is again changed, the arm rotated,\r\nand the eight star facets are cut. This completes the cutting of the\r\ncrown of the stone. The cutting lap is removed from the lap plate, and\r\nthe polishing lap is secured into place. The facets are carefully\r\npolished in the same order that they were cut. After the last star facet\r\nhas been polished, the stone is removed from the dop-stick. Any excess\r\ndop-wax is removed from the stone by means of a solvent, and the full\r\nbeauty of the finished gem is revealed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Tumbled Gems\r\n\r\n\r\nOne other method of finishing gemstones that deserves mention is\r\ntumbling. “Baroque” or “free-form” stones are produced in this manner.\r\nLoose pebbles or pieces of gem materials left over from other cutting\r\nprocesses are placed in a small barrel or specially constructed box with\r\nloose carborundum grit. The barrel is turned by means of a small motor,\r\nand the abrasion of the pebbles and grit against each other tends to\r\nround the pebbles and give them a finely pitted surface. Progressively\r\nfiner and finer carborundum grit is used, and eventually a polishing\r\ncompound. The result is several pounds of well-polished gem pebbles of\r\nvarious shapes and sizes. These baroque stones have found recent favor\r\nin costume jewelry of modern design. The tumbling process is rather\r\nslow, commonly requiring several days or weeks. However, little effort\r\nis involved on the part of the lapidary, and, consequently, the cost of\r\nmost tumbled or baroque stones is quite modest. Only gem material that\r\nis unsuitable for cutting in other manners should be finished in this\r\nway.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Fig. 12.

Burns with a\r\n  sweet, piney odor.\r\n\r\nRich brown to yellowish amber has been found near Eagle Pass, Maverick\r\nCounty, in Cretaceous coal and on Terlingua Creek, Brewster County.\r\nAlthough much of this material is translucent and the quality suitable\r\nfor lapidary purposes, the pieces are seldom more than a fraction of an\r\ninch in diameter.\r\n\r\nOccasional finds of poor quality brownish amber have been reported from\r\nthe Tertiary formations of the Gulf Coastal Plain, but thus far no gem\r\nquality material has been found.\r\n\r\nThe softness of amber limits its use to brooches, necklaces, and other\r\njewelry that is relatively safe from abrasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Augite\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Composition_: CaMgSi₂O₄; may also contain iron, aluminum, and\r\n  sometimes titanium. _Crystal system_: monoclinic. _Hardness_: 5 to 6.\r\n  _Specific gravity_: 3.2 to 3.6. _Luster_: vitreous to dull. _Color_:\r\n  dark greenish brown and greenish black. _Streak_: light grayish green.\r\n  _Cleavage_: two directions, poor. _Fracture_: conchoidal to uneven.\r\n  _Tenacity_: brittle. _Diaphaneity_: opaque to translucent. _Refractive\r\n  index_: variable, about 1.60 to 1.71.\r\n\r\nAugite of gem quality occurs near Eagle Flat, Hudspeth County, Texas.\r\nAlthough this material is very dark greenish brown and not commonly\r\nthought of as a gemstone, lapidaries have used it to fashion black\r\nfaceted stones and cabochons that resemble obsidian. Most of the augite\r\noccurs as loose pieces and crystal fragments that have weathered out of\r\nnearby igneous rocks; the augite can also be found in situ in the\r\nigneous rocks.\r\n\r\nSpecimens and pieces of cutting quality 1 inch in diameter are common,\r\nand fragments over 2 inches in diameter have been found. The augite is\r\nassociated with black spinel and some dark gray to black pieces of\r\nnatural glass. Although the faceted and cabochon-cut stones are not\r\nparticularly attractive, some of the larger pieces of augite might be\r\nutilized for carving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Beryl\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Composition_: Be₃Al₂(SiO)₆. _Crystal system_: hexagonal. _Hardness_:\r\n  7.5 to 8.0. _Specific gravity_: 2.63 to 2.80. _Luster_: vitreous.\r\n  _Color_: pale blue, blue, green, yellow, brownish, pink, and\r\n  colorless. _Streak_: white. _Cleavage_: one direction, very imperfect.\r\n  _Fracture_: conchoidal to uneven. _Tenacity_: brittle. _Diaphaneity_:\r\n  transparent to subtranslucent. _Refractive index_: 1.56 to 1.60.\r\n  _Dispersion_: low.\r\n\r\nGem-quality beryl has not been reported in Texas. A discussion of beryl\r\nis included herein because the writer believes it likely that beryl of\r\ngem quality will be found in Texas as a result of future investigations\r\nand exploration.\r\n\r\nBeryl crystals have been found in pegmatite dikes in Llano, Blanco, and\r\nGillespie counties. These crystals are commonly several inches long and\r\nexceed 1 inch in diameter but are very badly fractured. Most of the\r\nberyl crystals do not approach gem quality and are entirely unsuitable\r\nfor any lapidary use. The color of the crystals found thus far is\r\nbluish, greenish, pinkish brown, yellowish, and colorless. Some very\r\ntiny colorless beryl crystals have been found that are transparent, but\r\nthus far such crystals have been too small to be cut into gems.\r\n\r\nFine blue beryl crystals have been found in the Franklin Mountains near\r\nEl Paso, Texas. Unfortunately, these crystals are so badly flawed and\r\nfractured that they are not suitable for lapidary use.\r\n\r\nIt seems likely that careful prospecting of Texas pegmatites will reveal\r\nat least some gem-quality beryl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Celestite\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Composition_: SrSO₄. _Crystal system_: orthorhombic. _Hardness_: 3.0\r\n  to 3.5. _Specific gravity_: 3.95 to 3.98. _Luster_: vitreous. _Color_:\r\n  white, blue, greenish, reddish, and brownish. _Streak_: white.\r\n  _Cleavage_: three directions, although one of these directions is not\r\n  easily developed. _Fracture_: uneven. _Tenacity_: brittle.\r\n  _Diaphaneity_: transparent to subtranslucent. _Refractive index_: 1.62\r\n  to 1.63. _Dispersion_: moderate.\r\n\r\nCelestite is very seldom cut into gems. Being very soft, brittle, and\r\nhaving three cleavages, celestite is completely unsuitable for jewelry.\r\nThese same properties make this mineral exceedingly difficult to facet;\r\nhowever, faceted stones are seen in large collections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14. Common crystal form of Travis County celestite.\r\n               Same crystal form as shown in Plate I, A.]\r\n\r\nFine crystals of colorless and blue gem-quality celestite (Pl. I, A, and\r\nfig. 14) have been found at Mount Bonnell and other localities west of\r\nAustin, Travis County. The celestite crystals occur in vugs or geodes in\r\nlimestone. The crystals are mostly white or colorless and fractured near\r\nthe base or where attached, but the tips of the crystals are commonly\r\nclear celestine blue and completely free of flaws.\r\n\r\nCrystals several inches in length have been found, but the average size\r\nis about 1 inch. The smaller crystals are frequently more transparent\r\nand consequently better suited for cutting. It is very difficult to\r\nobtain crystals that will allow the cutting of flawless stones of more\r\nthan 4 or 5 carats.\r\n\r\nBluish and colorless celestite of gem quality and fine crystals have\r\nbeen found near Lampasas, Lampasas County, and near Brownwood, Brown\r\nCounty, but neither of these localities has been very productive of good\r\ngem material.\r\n\r\nCelestite geodes have been found in parts of Coke, Fisher, and Nolan\r\ncounties, but these geodes contain little gem material.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Diamond\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Composition_: carbon. _Crystal system_: isometric. _Hardness_: 10.\r\n  _Specific gravity_: 3.51 to 3.53. _Luster_: adamantine to greasy.\r\n  _Color_: brown, colorless, pink, blue, yellow, and various other light\r\n  colors; rarely deeply colored; sometimes black. _Cleavage_: four\r\n  directions, octahedral, perfect. _Fracture_: conchoidal. _Tenacity_:\r\n  brittle. _Diaphaneity_: transparent to opaque. _Refractive index_:\r\n  2.42. _Dispersion_: high.\r\n\r\nThere is only one well-authenticated find of diamond in Texas. A small\r\nbrownish diamond was found in 1911 on section 64, block 44, Foard County\r\n(Sterrett, 1912, pp. 1040-1041). The exact weight of the stone has not\r\nbeen recorded, but one authority estimated that it was of sufficient\r\nsize and clarity to yield a cut stone of about one-quarter carat.\r\n\r\nThe only diamond-bearing rocks known in the United States are in Pike\r\nCounty, Arkansas. Although many other diamonds have been found in the\r\nUnited States, all were loose in gravels or streams except for some\r\nstones at the Arkansas locality. The fact that one diamond was found in\r\nFoard County does not mean that the prospects of finding more diamonds\r\nin Texas are much better there than anywhere else in the State. It is\r\nhighly unlikely that more than a very few diamonds will ever be found in\r\nTexas, and any stones that may be found in the future are likely to be\r\nwidely scattered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Epidote\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Composition_: HCa₂(Al, Fe)₂Si₃O₁₃. _Crystal system_: monoclinic.\r\n  _Hardness_: 6 to 7. _Specific gravity_: 3.25 to 3.5. _Luster_:\r\n  vitreous. _Color_: yellowish green to brownish green and brown.\r\n  _Streak_: uncolored to grayish. _Cleavage_: two directions.\r\n  _Fracture_: uneven. _Tenacity_: brittle. _Diaphaneity_: transparent to\r\n  opaque. _Refractive index_: about 1.72 to 1.77.\r\n\r\nLlano County has furnished some green and brownish-green epidote that is\r\nsuitable for cutting into cabochons. Most of the material that\r\napproaches gem quality has come from contact metamorphic zones and is\r\nassociated with garnet, quartz, and some scheelite. Some small cavities\r\nin the rocks contain tiny transparent crystals of gem quality, but the\r\nlargest obtainable flawless faceted stones would probably be less than\r\n15 points.\r\n\r\nFaceted stones of epidote are sometimes known as pistacite owing to\r\ntheir common pistachio-green color.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Fluorite\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Composition_: CaF₂. _Crystal system_: isometric. _Hardness_: 4.\r\n  _Specific gravity_: 3.0 to 3.25. _Luster_: vitreous. _Color_: violet,\r\n  blue, colorless, green, yellow, brown, rose, and crimson red.\r\n  _Streak_: white. _Cleavage_: four directions, octahedral, perfect.\r\n  _Fracture_: subconchoidal to splintery. _Tenacity_: brittle.\r\n  _Diaphaneity_: transparent to subtranslucent. _Refractive index_:\r\n  1.434.\r\n\r\nVery fine green, transparent fluorite has been found near Voca, Mason\r\nCounty. The fluorite occurs as vug fillings in pegmatites, associated\r\nwith crystals of pink microcline and colorless quartz. Most of the vugs\r\nhave been completely filled by the fluorite; therefore, crystals (fig.\r\n15) of the fluorite are not too common. Masses of fluorite several\r\npounds in weight, rich green, and quite transparent have been found near\r\nVoca. Transparent pieces an inch or more in diameter are common.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: Fig. 15. Common crystal form of fluorite.]\r\n\r\nFluorite is much too soft for everyday use in jewelry and because of the\r\nlow refractive index does not yield brilliant faceted stones. The\r\nperfect four-directional cleavage, relative softness, and brittle\r\ntenacity of the mineral make it difficult to facet. Faceted stones are\r\nseldom seen outside of collections. Cabochons are also difficult to cut\r\nfrom this material, but the rich color obtained is ample reward for the\r\ntime and care necessary in cutting.\r\n\r\nFluorite occurs at several other localities in Texas, notably in\r\nHudspeth, Brewster, Presidio, Llano, and Burnet counties, but not\r\ncommonly in gem quality or colors that warrant its use as gem material.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Fossil Wood\r\n\r\n\r\nWood that is buried in silica-rich sediments is commonly replaced by\r\nquartz, agate, or opal. The wood structure, including a large number of\r\nthe annular rings, knots, small branches, and bark, may be preserved.\r\nThis process of replacement by silica is believed to take considerable\r\ntime. Preservations by other means (_see_ Jet, p. 22) are known, but\r\nsilica replacements are most commonly used as gem materials.\r\n\r\nFossil wood is often used by lapidaries as gem material when mineral\r\nreplacement preserves the wood structure sufficiently well and when\r\nvarious impurities color the replacement material attractively.\r\n\r\nExcellent gem-quality fossil wood (Pl. I, B) has been found at a great\r\nnumber of localities in Texas. Agatized and opalized wood occurs in\r\ngreat abundance along the outcrops of Eocene and Oligocene strata of the\r\nTexas Gulf Coastal Plain. Much of this material is very well suited for\r\ncabochons, bookends, and other lapidary uses. The preservation is\r\nespecially good at numerous localities in Washington, Lee, Fayette, and\r\nGonzales counties, and the variety of colors, such as bluish, gray,\r\nbrown, red, yellow, and black, makes this material especially sought\r\nafter by “rock-hounds.” Some of the agatized and opalized wood\r\nfluoresces yellow or green under ultra-violet light. The fossil wood is\r\nsometimes found as stumps, limb sections, or large trunk fragments, but\r\nthe great majority of the gem material is found as small broken\r\nfragments or stream-rolled cobbles.\r\n\r\nFossil palm wood is by far the most sought after variety because this\r\nmaterial displays “eyes” and tube-like structures that yield very\r\nattractive cabochons and cabinet specimens. Texas fossil palm wood is\r\nhighly regarded by cutters from all parts of the country, and this\r\nmaterial is thought by many lapidaries to be some of the finest\r\ngem-quality fossil wood in the United States.\r\n\r\nGravel pits and river gravels in Live Oak County have produced very fine\r\nagatized wood. Although the gem material does not seem to be as abundant\r\nin this area as it is in counties to the northeast, the vivid colors and\r\nexcellent preservation of the fossil wood in Live Oak County have\r\nattracted collectors from all over the State. The fossil wood usually\r\noccurs as large rounded cobbles in the streams. Much of this material is\r\nquite translucent when cut and contains various shades of brown, orange,\r\nand red.\r\n\r\nThe gravels of the Rio Grande have produced some fossil wood in addition\r\nto the excellent agate that is also found there. Most of the fossil wood\r\nfound in these gravels is very well preserved, but the colors are\r\ncommonly dull shades of brown. Occasional fine red and yellow specimens\r\nhave been recovered from the Rio Grande gravels, but these are rare.\r\n\r\nGood agatized wood has been found in and near Palo Duro Canyon,\r\nArmstrong County, about 50 miles southeast of Amarillo. Large trunk\r\nsections are not uncommon, but most of the material of cutting quality\r\nis obtained from small fragments. The Palo Duro Canyon fossil wood\r\ngreatly resembles the famous Arizona Petrified Forest wood but is not\r\nnearly as plentiful. The Palo Duro wood contains yellow, brown, red, and\r\nbluish colors most commonly. Some of the wood-producing area is within\r\nPalo Duro Canyon State Park which is, of course, closed to collecting.\r\nThe surrounding area has been worked diligently by local collectors, but\r\nnew pieces of wood are exposed after heavy rains.\r\n\r\nWebb and Duval counties have also produced some good fossil wood\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Gadolinite\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Composition_: Be₂FeY₂Si₂O₁₀. (Various other rare-earth elements may\r\n  substitute into this mineral structure.) _Crystal system_: monoclinic.\r\n  _Hardness_: 6.5 to 7.0. _Specific gravity_: about 4.2. _Luster_:\r\n  vitreous to greasy. _Color_: black; in thin splinters dark bottle\r\n  green. _Streak_: white to greenish. _Cleavage_: none. _Fracture_:\r\n  conchoidal to splintery. _Tenacity_: brittle. _Diaphaneity_: opaque to\r\n  subtransparent in thin pieces. _Refractive index_: variable, about\r\n  1.77 to 1.82.\r\n\r\nGadolinite as a cut gem is not seen outside of large collections;\r\nhowever, it can be faceted into black opaque stones of little beauty but\r\nof great interest to collectors. The best known locality of this mineral\r\nin the United States is Baringer Hill, Llano County, Texas.\r\nUnfortunately, this locality was completely flooded by the completion of\r\nBuchanan Dam in 1938. Masses and rough crystals of gadolinite weighing\r\nover 100 pounds were mined from this locality. The gadolinite occurred\r\nin a large, very coarse-grained pegmatite dike associated with quartz,\r\nmicrocline, and fluorite, as well as allanite, fergusonite, nivenite,\r\ncyrtolite, thorogummite, and various other rare minerals. Some of the\r\nminerals in the dike occurred in very large masses. One quartz mass over\r\n40 feet in diameter was noted, and microcline masses up to 30 feet in\r\ndiameter were not uncommon. Much of the gadolinite was used by\r\nindustrial firms as a source of thorium compounds, although some\r\nspecimen and gem material found its way into museums and private\r\ncollections. Because the locality was worked mostly from 1910 to about\r\n1925 and because since 1938 the waters of Lake Buchanan have completely\r\nflooded the entire area, material from this locality is now exceedingly\r\ndifficult to obtain. The collection of the Smithsonian Institution,\r\nWashington, D.C., contains a cut and polished gem of Baringer Hill\r\ngadolinite that weighs 8.6 carats. This mineral is radioactive because\r\nof the presence of uranium, thorium, and other rare radioactive\r\nelements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Garnet\r\n\r\n\r\nThe garnet group of minerals is variable in composition. Listed below\r\nare the pure members of this group, but garnets found in nature are\r\nusually a mixture of two or more of these end members.\r\n\r\n  Aluminum garnet—\r\n    Grossularite (calcium-aluminum garnet), Ca₃Al₂(SiO₄)₃\r\n    Pyrope (magnesium-aluminum garnet), Mg₃Al₂(SiO₄)₃\r\n    Almandite (iron-aluminum garnet), Fe₃Al₂(SiO₄)₃\r\n    Spessartite (manganese-aluminum garnet), Mn₃Al₂(SiO₄)₃\r\n  Iron garnet—\r\n    Andradite (calcium-iron garnet), Ca₃Fe₂(SiO₄)₃; may contain\r\n          magnesium, titanium, and yttrium\r\n  Chromium garnet—\r\n    Uvarovite (calcium-chromium garnet), Ca₃Cr₂(SiO₄)₃\r\n\r\nSince almandite is the only variety of garnet known to occur commonly in\r\ngem quality in Texas, the following properties are for almandite except\r\nwhere noted.\r\n\r\n  _Crystal system_: isometric (all varieties). _Hardness_: about 7.5.\r\n  _Specific gravity_: 4.25. _Luster_: vitreous to resinous. _Color_:\r\n  red, deep red, and brownish red (other varieties also yellow, white,\r\n  orange, pink, black, and green). _Streak_: white. _Cleavage_: none.\r\n  _Fracture_: subconchoidal to uneven. _Tenacity_: brittle to tough.\r\n  _Diaphaneity_: transparent to subtranslucent. _Refractive index_:\r\n  about 1.83.\r\n\r\nGood crystals of gem-quality almandite garnet have been found in Llano,\r\nBlanco, Burnet, and Gillespie counties. In southeast Llano County,\r\nnorthwest Blanco County, and northeast Gillespie County, the stones\r\nmostly occur in stream gravels where they have collected after being\r\nweathered out of compact mica schists. Owing to the fact that most of\r\nthe garnets have not been transported very far from their source, the\r\nstones commonly show good crystal form (Pl. II, A). All of the garnets\r\nfrom one locality commonly do not have exactly the same crystal form.\r\nThe garnets are mostly widely scattered in the stream gravels but can be\r\nfound concentrated behind rocks and on small gravel bars.\r\n\r\nMany of the crystals are less than one-eighth inch in diameter; however,\r\ngood crystals one-fourth to one-half inch in diameter are common. Most\r\nof the stones are too fractured or have too many inclusions to yield\r\ngems, but many transparent stones have been found. The transparent\r\ncrystals usually yield flawless deep red faceted stones of 2 carats or\r\nless. Some of the stones that contain too many inclusions to facet are\r\ncut as cabochons and are then often known as carbuncle.\r\n\r\nSmall garnet fragments have been found in streams and in gneisses and\r\npegmatites near Castell, Llano County, but they are not commonly of gem\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nOccasional small gem-quality garnets have been found in pegmatites and\r\ncontact metamorphic zones in Burnet County. Garnets have also been found\r\nin several other counties, notably Mason, El Paso, Hudspeth, and\r\nCulberson, but no stones of facet quality have been reported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Jet\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Composition_: a variety of brown coal or lignite. _Structure_: woody.\r\n  _Hardness_: 3 to 4. _Specific gravity_: about 1.30 to 1.35. _Luster_:\r\n  dull. _Color_: black, brownish black. _Streak_: brown to brownish\r\n  black. _Cleavage_: none. _Fracture_: uneven to smooth. _Tenacity_:\r\n  tough to slightly brittle. _Diaphaneity_: opaque. Burns with a sooty\r\n  yellowish flame.\r\n\r\nJet is a type of fossil wood in which there has been sufficient chemical\r\nchange to make the wood relatively hard and black without destroying the\r\nwoody structure. The best specimens of jet polish into lustrous black\r\ncabochons.\r\n\r\nJet occurs in Presidio County as compressed and flattened trunks of\r\ntrees in a thin layer of coal and lignite in Cretaceous strata 100 to\r\n200 feet stratigraphically below the San Carlos beds.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of “jet” have been found in some of the lignitic Tertiary\r\nstrata of the Texas Gulf Coastal Plain; however, this material is mostly\r\nsoft, brownish, and not of gem quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Labradorite\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Composition_: NaAlSi₃O₈, 50% to 30%; CaAl₂Si₂O₈, 50% to 70%. _Crystal\r\n  system_: triclinic. _Hardness_: 6.0 to 6.5. _Specific gravity_: about\r\n  2.60. _Luster_: vitreous to sometimes pearly. _Color_: straw yellow,\r\n  white, greenish, gray, reddish, bluish, and green. Sometimes shows a\r\n  play of colors on particular cleavage surfaces. _Streak_: uncolored.\r\n  _Cleavage_: three directions. _Fracture_: uneven to conchoidal.\r\n  _Tenacity_: brittle. _Diaphaneity_: transparent to translucent.\r\n  _Refractive index_: about 1.56. _Dispersion_: low.\r\n\r\nVery fine facet-quality labradorite has been found about 20 miles south\r\nof Alpine, Brewster County. The labradorite occurs loose in the soil as\r\nslightly weathered or frosted cleavage fragments, commonly showing one\r\nor more crystal faces (Pl. II, B). The pale-yellow or straw-yellow color\r\nof these fragments, as well as their lack of internal imperfections,\r\nmakes these stones excellent gem material. Individual pieces that exceed\r\nthree-fourths inch in their longest dimensions are rare. Cut stones of\r\nmore than 5 or 6 carats from this locality are scarce. The source of\r\nthis material is uncertain, but it is probably weathering out of an\r\nunderlying igneous rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Microcline\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Composition_: KAlSi₃O₈. _Crystal system_: triclinic. _Hardness_: 6.0\r\n  to 6.5. _Specific gravity_: 2.54 to 2.57. _Luster_: vitreous to\r\n  pearly. _Color_: white, pale yellow, red, blue green, bluish.\r\n  _Streak_: white. _Cleavage_: four directions, usually three of these\r\n  distinct. _Fracture_: uneven. _Tenacity_: brittle _Diaphaneity_:\r\n  transparent to translucent. _Refractive index_: about 1.52 to 1.53.\r\n\r\nVery fine crystals of blue microcline have been found east of Packsaddle\r\nMountain and near Kingsland in Llano County. Crystals exceeding 1 foot\r\nin length have been found, although most are only a few inches long. The\r\ncolor of the microcline is mostly pale blue, but some crystals are\r\ndarker. Microcline crystals associated with milky or vein quartz, smoky\r\nquartz, some biotite, and rarely cassiterite occur in pegmatite dikes\r\nwhich vary in size from a few inches to several feet in thickness. The\r\ncolor of this microcline is pale in comparison to microcline from some\r\nother localities in the United States, but the Texas blue microcline\r\ndoes yield pleasing cabochons. Perfect crystals of this material are\r\nprized by collectors. Blue or greenish microcline is often called\r\namazonite or amazon stone.\r\n\r\nBluish microcline associated with quartz and topaz has also been\r\nreported near Katemcy, Mason County.\r\n\r\nRed microcline is common in several central Texas counties and is a\r\nprimary constituent of many of the igneous rocks in those counties.\r\nLarge crystals of perthitic red microcline occur in pegmatite dikes of\r\nMason, Llano, Burnet, and Gillespie counties. Any feldspar quarry or\r\nother pegmatite mining operation in any of these counties is likely to\r\ncontain large red microcline crystals and fragments. Unfortunately, the\r\ngood crystals that may have been present are often shattered by blasting\r\nduring quarrying operations.\r\n\r\nFeldspar quarries in northeastern Gillespie County have yielded some\r\ngood red cabochon material as well as good crystals. Here the microcline\r\noccurs with milky and smoky vein quartz, smoky quartz crystals, clear\r\nquartz crystals, greenish muscovite, and biotite. Many of the older\r\nquarries in Gillespie County have not been active for some time, and the\r\ndumps and quarry walls have been diligently searched by collectors.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Fig. 16. Crystal faces on microcline specimen shown in\r\n                             Plate III, A.]\r\n\r\nMany of the pegmatite dikes near Lake Buchanan in Llano and Burnet\r\ncounties have produced some good red microcline specimens and cutting\r\nmaterial (Pl. III, A, and fig. 16). Many of these crystals are more\r\npinkish than those in Gillespie County, but this is commonly due to the\r\nfact that the crystal faces of the Lake Buchanan area crystals are\r\nsomewhat more weathered than the fresh Gillespie County crystals.\r\n\r\nNumerous other local areas in the counties mentioned, as well as some\r\nlocalities in Hudspeth and Culberson counties, have also produced small\r\namounts of red and pink microcline of gem quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Obsidian\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Composition_: volcanic glass. _Structure_: amorphous. _Hardness_: 5.0\r\n  to 5.5. _Specific gravity_: 2.3 to 2.5. _Luster_: vitreous. _Color_:\r\n  black, dark gray, reddish, brown, bluish, and greenish. _Streak_:\r\n  white. _Cleavage_: none. _Fracture_: conchoidal. _Tenacity_: brittle.\r\n  _Diaphaneity_: translucent to nearly opaque. _Refractive index_:\r\n  variable, about 1.45 to 1.53.\r\n\r\nGem-quality black and dark-gray obsidian has been found in Presidio\r\nCounty associated with extrusive igneous rocks. The obsidian in this\r\narea is too opaque to serve as attractive faceted stones but is found in\r\npieces of sufficient size and quality to yield nice cabochons. Some of\r\nthe small weathered pieces of this material resemble tektite in outward\r\nappearance; in fact, the “valverdites” mistaken originally for tektites\r\nare pebbles of weathered obsidian in terrace gravel of Val Verde County.\r\nObsidian takes a high polish but is very sensitive to heat. Stones that\r\nare slightly overheated during grinding or sanding will quickly shatter.\r\n\r\nObsidian of gem quality has been reported also in Brewster County.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Opal\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Composition_: SiO₂·nH₂O. _Structure_: amorphous. _Hardness_: 5.5 to\r\n  6.5. _Specific gravity_: 1.9 to 2.3. _Luster_: subvitreous to pearly.\r\n  _Color_: white, bluish, pink, brown, yellow, and gray. _Streak_:\r\n  white. _Cleavage_: none. _Fracture_: conchoidal. _Tenacity_: brittle.\r\n  _Diaphaneity_: transparent to nearly opaque. _Refractive index_: 1.43.\r\n\r\nOpal other than as fossil or opalized wood (pp. 20-21) occurs at the\r\nfollowing several localities in Texas.\r\n\r\nApproximately 16 miles south of Alpine, Brewster County, precious opal\r\noccurs in very small seams and as cavity fillings in very hard\r\npinkish-brown rhyolite. This opal is milky or bluish and commonly\r\nexhibits small flashes of blue, green, red, and orange fire. Individual\r\npieces of this opal are mostly quite small, rarely over one-fourth inch\r\nin diameter, and very difficult to remove from the tough rhyolite\r\nmatrix. Local lapidaries have cut interesting cabochons from this\r\nmaterial in which several small patches of opal that are close together\r\nin the matrix are included in the same cabochon.\r\n\r\nSmall finds of opal associated with rhyolites and basalts have come from\r\nother localities in west Texas, but the opal mostly does not display\r\nenough play of colors to warrant its use as gem material.\r\n\r\nNear Freer, Duval County, some very attractive common opal has been\r\nfound. The opal is colored various shades of pink, blue, and yellow and\r\nin certain local areas occurs as fragments that are cemented together by\r\nclear chalcedony. Various colors are commonly found in the same piece,\r\nand such material yields handsome cabochons. Although the area has never\r\nbeen worked commercially, it has been hunted by collectors and cutters\r\nfor several years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Pearl\r\n\r\n\r\nPearls are the result of the secretion of calcium carbonate by various\r\nshellfish around sand grains, parasitic organisms, shell fragments, or\r\nother foreign objects that have in some way entered the body cavity of\r\nthe shellfish. Since the shellfish is unable to expel these irritating\r\nparticles or organisms, it deposits successive layers of calcium\r\ncarbonate around the foreign substance to make it smoother and less\r\nirritating. Although pearls are principally calcium carbonate, they also\r\ncontain small amounts of an organic substance, called conchiolin, and\r\nwater. Pearls are found in shellfish that live in either fresh or salt\r\nwater. Few pearls are spherical in shape; most are rounded but somewhat\r\nirregular and are known as baroque pearls. Good quality pearls are the\r\nonly gemstone commonly sold by the grain, a unit of weight equal to 0.25\r\ncarat or 0.05 gram. The pearl grain is not the same unit of weight as\r\nthe Troy grain.\r\n\r\nIn Texas, pearls have been found in fresh-water clams in most of the\r\nmajor rivers and streams, notably in the Brazos, Concho, Colorado,\r\nGuadalupe, Llano, Nueces, Sabine, Rio Grande, and Trinity Rivers.\r\nSeveral Texas lakes have also yielded pearls, notably Caddo Lake and\r\nother lakes in north-central and northeast Texas.\r\n\r\nSmall pearls are frequently found along the Texas Gulf Coast in edible\r\noysters and other common shellfish. Fossil pearls have also been found\r\nbut because of their darkened appearance are of value only as\r\ncuriosities.\r\n\r\nThe pearls thus far found in Texas have been of relatively poor quality\r\nand show little or no iridescence. These pearls have little value except\r\nas curiosities, although one writer has stated that the discovery of\r\npearls in the Nueces River led to the original Spanish settlement of the\r\nState (Baker, 1935, p. 569).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Quartz\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Composition_: SiO₂. _Crystal system_: hexagonal. _Hardness_: 7.\r\n  _Specific gravity_: 2.65 to 2.66 in crystals. _Luster_: vitreous, also\r\n  waxy, greasy, and dull. _Color_: most often colorless, brown, yellow,\r\n  violet; sometimes green, red, blue, and black; cryptocrystalline\r\n  varieties often variously colored by impurities. _Streak_: white.\r\n  _Cleavage_: indistinct. _Fracture_: conchoidal to splintery.\r\n  _Tenacity_: brittle to tough. _Diaphaneity_: transparent to opaque.\r\n  _Refractive index_: 1.544 to 1.553.\r\n\r\nThe quartz family gemstones can be divided into two groups for purposes\r\nof description. The first group is the crystalline varieties, or those\r\nquartz varieties that commonly occur in distinct crystals. The second\r\ngroup is the cryptocrystalline varieties, or those quartz varieties that\r\noccur as irregular masses that are composed of many microscopic\r\ncrystals. The crystalline varieties are usually much more transparent\r\nand are most often seen as faceted stones. The cryptocrystalline\r\nvarieties vary from subtransparent to opaque and are almost always cut\r\nas cabochons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CRYSTALLINE VARIETIES\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amethyst_ (violet to purple-colored quartz).—A northeastern Gillespie\r\nCounty locality known as Amethyst Hill has produced quite a number of\r\nfine light to medium violet amethyst crystals which occur in quartz\r\nveins and geodes associated with serpentine and talc. Many crystals have\r\nbeen found loose in the soil.\r\n\r\nThe amethyst tends to be very irregularly colored in zones parallel to\r\nthe crystal faces. In many, the base of the crystal is colorless or\r\nwhite and only the termination is violet. Crystals up to 3 inches long\r\nhave been found at this locality, but the average size is much less.\r\n\r\nThe surface at this locality is almost entirely depleted of amethyst,\r\nwith only an occasional small crystal or fragment to be seen. However,\r\nsmall excavations are still sometimes productive.\r\n\r\nGood groups of pale amethyst crystals have been found in quartz veins\r\nnear the old town site of Oxford, Llano County. The occurrence seems to\r\nbe much the same as the Amethyst Hill locality. Little exploration for\r\ngemstones has been done in this area, and future discoveries seem\r\nlikely.\r\n\r\nChalcedony geodes lined with amethyst crystals have been found in\r\nBrewster, Presidio, Culberson, and Hudspeth counties, but the\r\noccurrences are scattered. The crystals are seldom large enough to yield\r\ngems of more than 3 carats and are mostly very light colored.\r\n\r\nA few pieces of gem-quality amethyst have been found in Burnet County.\r\n\r\n_Citrine_ (yellow quartz).—Very little gem-quality citrine has been\r\nreported in Texas. Some small citrine crystals have been found at\r\nAmethyst Hill in northeastern Gillespie County, but few are of\r\nsufficient size or color to yield good gems.\r\n\r\nThe writer has seen one citrine crystal that was found in the gravels of\r\na small stream in eastern Llano County near Buchanan Dam. The crystal\r\nweighs about 1 ounce and is perfectly clear, light golden yellow, and\r\nflawless. However, a further search of the stream gravels failed to\r\nproduce any other citrines.\r\n\r\n_Rock crystal_ (colorless quartz).—Numerous localities in Texas produce\r\nthis colorless variety of quartz, which is the most common variety of\r\nfacet quality quartz and consequently is of little value.\r\n\r\nRock crystal occurs at many localities in Burnet, Llano, and Mason\r\ncounties. The crystals mostly occur in pegmatite dikes or in stream\r\ngravels where they have been weathered out of their parent rock. Some\r\nfine colorless quartz crystals have been found near Voca, Mason County,\r\nin weathered pegmatite dikes and also loose in the sands of nearby\r\nstreams. Crystals from this locality are often stained with reddish iron\r\noxide on their outer surfaces. Some of the rock crystal found near\r\nKatemcy, Mason County, shows asterism when cut with the proper\r\norientation. Fine clear colorless crystals up to 8 inches long have been\r\nfound in the pegmatite dikes near Lake Buchanan in both Llano and Burnet\r\ncounties. Several localities near Enchanted Rock in Llano County have\r\nalso produced some good colorless crystals.\r\n\r\nFeldspar quarries in large pegmatites in northeastern Gillespie County\r\nhave yielded attractive quartz crystals, some of which contain smoky\r\nphantom crystals and tourmaline inclusions.\r\n\r\nSome pieces of rock crystal enclosing green, needle-like actinolite\r\ncrystals have been found near the Llano-Gillespie-Blanco County corner.\r\nThis material is not suitable for faceted gems but does lend itself to\r\ninteresting and attractive cabochons.\r\n\r\nColorless quartz crystals commonly are found lining small chalcedony\r\ngeodes in Brewster, Presidio, Culberson, Hudspeth, Reeves, and Jeff\r\nDavis counties. These crystals are most commonly less than 1 inch long\r\nbut are mostly very clear.\r\n\r\nRock crystal has been found in crevices of petrified wood in many east\r\nand southeast Texas counties, although the crystals are mostly quite\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nMany lesser occurrences of rock crystal, too numerous to mention, are\r\nlocated within the State.\r\n\r\n_Rose quartz_ (pink quartz).—Rose quartz occurs at various localities in\r\nBurnet, Llano, Mason, and Gillespie counties, but the amount of material\r\nis mostly small and the greater part unsuitable for gem purposes. Some\r\ngood pink rose quartz occurs near Town Mountain, Llano County, but this\r\nmaterial does not have flawless areas large enough to yield faceted\r\nstones of more than a few carats. Rose quartz is always slightly milky,\r\nor cloudy, and does not cut into brilliant faceted stones. The Town\r\nMountain rose quartz has been cut into attractive cabochons.\r\n\r\n_Smoky quartz_ (brown, yellow-brown, and golden-brown quartz).—Several\r\nTexas localities have produced fine smoky quartz. Baringer Hill, a noted\r\nrare-earth minerals pegmatite locality in Llano County, contained some\r\nsmoky quartz crystals that were estimated to weigh over 1,000 pounds,\r\nand the locality produced many smaller crystals that were of gem\r\nquality. Baringer Hill was flooded by the completion of Buchanan Dam in\r\n1938 and is presently under the waters of Lake Buchanan. A few fine\r\ngolden-brown gem-quality crystals have been found along the lake shore\r\nand in small pegmatites nearby (Pl. III, B.).\r\n\r\nFeldspar quarries in northeastern Gillespie County have produced smoky\r\nquartz crystals that exceed 1 foot in length, but these crystals are\r\nmostly flawed, possibly as a result of blasting, and mostly contain only\r\nsmall clear areas.\r\n\r\nGood color smoky quartz crystals are found with topaz in the pegmatites\r\nand stream beds in Mason County, near Streeter, Grit, and Katemcy. These\r\ncrystals tend to be lighter colored than those near Lake Buchanan, but\r\nthey commonly contain large flawless areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      CRYPTOCRYSTALLINE VARIETIES\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chalcedony._—When free from impurities of various oxides and other\r\ncompounds, chalcedony has little to render it pleasing as a gemstone. It\r\nis mostly gray, white, brown, or bluish and commonly has a waxy luster.\r\nSome of the chalcedony found along the Rio Grande Valley and in west\r\nTexas will take dyes, and local lapidaries have had some success in\r\ndyeing this material various shades of blue, green, yellow, and red.\r\nWhen the chalcedony is naturally colored and variegated, usually in\r\nbands, mossy figures, or dendritic forms, it is called agate.\r\n\r\n_Agate_ (variegated chalcedony).—The wide variety of markings and colors\r\navailable together with the ease of cutting make agate a favorite of\r\nmany lapidaries. Fine agate has been found at numerous localities in\r\nwest and south Texas. Fine plume agate, famous throughout the United\r\nStates, is found south of Alpine. Plume agate is characterized by\r\ndendritic or tree-like inclusions and is mostly cut into very handsome\r\ncabochons. The agate from south of Alpine commonly contains black, red,\r\nyellow, or brown plumes within the same piece. The variety of colors and\r\nlack of porosity of this agate make it highly desired among lapidaries.\r\nThe agate occurs loose on the surface of the ground and in the soil in\r\nsmall nodules that have a very rough, brownish surface. These nodules\r\nare mostly less than 3 inches in diameter, although specimens of gem\r\nquality have been found that exceed 200 pounds.\r\n\r\nSome very fine agate has been found in the vicinity of Needle Peak,\r\nPresidio County. This material is mostly green moss agate in clear\r\nchalcedony and commonly contains small yellow “sun-burst” figures. The\r\ncontrasting yellow and green design makes very beautiful cabochons.\r\n\r\nFine agate has been found south of Marfa, Presidio County. This agate is\r\nmostly clear chalcedony with black, yellow, or variously colored plumes,\r\nmoss, or “bouquet-like” figures.\r\n\r\nNumerous other localities in Presidio and Brewster counties have\r\nproduced good agate.\r\n\r\nVarious amounts of agate, jasper, and chalcedony occur in the gravels of\r\nthe Rio Grande in varying quantities from Big Bend National Park\r\ndownstream to Brownsville. This agate is found both in the present river\r\ngravels and in the older river gravels that now are located on nearby\r\nhills and slopes up to several miles north or south of the present Rio\r\nGrande. The greatest concentration of agate and related gem materials\r\nseems to be in the area between Laredo and Rio Grande City. Vast\r\nquantities of excellent gem material have been removed from this area\r\nfor many years (Pl. IV). The agate occurs as rounded, stream-worn\r\ncobbles and commonly has a thin white coating that makes it difficult to\r\ndistinguish from the abundant chert and other rocks. The agate occurs in\r\ncobbles that are mostly 3 to 6 inches in diameter, but specimens of gem\r\nquality that exceed twice this size are known. The agate varies greatly\r\nin design and color. Plume, moss, banded, and sagenitic agate occur in\r\nthese gravels in a wide variety of colors. The jasper in the Rio Grande\r\ngravels is yellow, red, green, or various shades of these and is\r\ncommonly suspended as angular fragments in clear chalcedony.\r\n\r\nGood agate has also been found near Balmorhea in Reeves and Jeff Davis\r\ncounties and in smaller amounts at numerous other west and south Texas\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\n_Agatized wood_ (_see_ Fossil wood, pp. 20-21).\r\n\r\n_Carnelian_ (translucent reddish chalcedony).—This variety of chalcedony\r\nin small quantities has been reported from near Van Horn, Hudspeth\r\nCounty. Small pieces of carnelian have been found in the gravels of the\r\nRio Grande, but finds have been few and scattered.\r\n\r\n_Jasper_ (impure opaque or subtranslucent quartz).—Good green, yellow,\r\nred, and brown jasper has been found in the gravels of the Rio Grande at\r\nall of the localities that produce agate. The colors are quite vivid,\r\nand the material takes a fine polish. Some pieces of orbicular jasper\r\n(jasper with circular or eye-like markings) have been found in this\r\nmaterial. These gravels commonly contain jasper as fragments that are\r\nsuspended in clear chalcedony; this is called brecciated jasper and\r\nyields very handsome cabochons.\r\n\r\nMany of the west Texas agate localities also produce jasper in quantity.\r\nGood jasper has been reported from north of Brackettville, Kinney\r\nCounty. Jasper is a minor constituent of the stream gravels in many\r\nparts of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Sanidine\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Composition_: KAlSi₃O₈; commonly contains some sodium. _Crystal\r\n  system_: monoclinic. _Hardness_: 6. _Specific gravity_: 2.57 to 2.58.\r\n  _Luster_: vitreous to pearly. _Color_: colorless, white, pale yellow,\r\n  and gray. _Streak_: uncolored. _Cleavage_: three directions.\r\n  _Fracture_: conchoidal to uneven. _Tenacity_: brittle. _Diaphaneity_:\r\n  transparent to subtranslucent. _Refractive index_: 1.52 to 1.53.\r\n\r\nSome feldspars, including sanidine, show a nice blue sheen in reflected\r\nlight parallel to certain crystallographic directions. Stones having\r\nthis property are called moonstone. A clear yellowish sanidine showing\r\nan attractive blue sheen has been found in Brewster, Jeff Davis, and\r\nPresidio counties. The individual pieces are small, the average size\r\nbeing about one-eighth inch. The sanidine is found loose in the soil at\r\nsome localities where it has weathered out of rhyolite, and specimens of\r\nthe sanidine in the parent rock are not difficult to obtain. Very small\r\ncabochons can be cut from this material, but few lapidaries have done so\r\nbecause inexpensive larger pieces of moonstone can be obtained easily\r\nfrom foreign sources. However, the west Texas sanidine does show a blue\r\nsheen when cut and polished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Spinel\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Composition_: MgAl₂O₄ (magnesium may be replaced in part by ferrous\r\n  iron or manganese and the aluminum by ferric iron and chromium).\r\n  _Crystal system_: isometric. _Hardness_: 8. _Specific gravity_: 3.5 to\r\n  4.1. _Luster_: vitreous to sub-metallic. _Color_: black, pink, red,\r\n  blue, green, yellow, brown, and violet. _Streak_: white. _Cleavage_:\r\n  one direction, imperfect. _Fracture_: conchoidal. _Tenacity_: brittle.\r\n  _Diaphaneity_: transparent to opaque. _Refractive index_: variable,\r\n  approximately 1.72 to 2.00.\r\n\r\nIn many areas of the world, fine quality, beautifully colored,\r\ntransparent spinels are found and used as gems. The only gem-quality\r\nspinel reported thus far in Texas is black and opaque. Near Eagle Flat\r\nin Hudspeth County, black spinel crystals have been found associated\r\nwith augite and natural glass; these minerals are weathering out of an\r\nintrusive igneous rock. The spinel crystals have an octahedral form\r\nwhich is common for this mineral (fig. 17). Most of the spinels are free\r\nof flaws, but because of their black color they have little value as\r\ngems. The crystals are found loose in the sand of streams near the\r\noutcrops of the igneous rock or embedded in the rock. They seldom exceed\r\nhalf an inch in diameter. These stones are primarily sought by\r\ncollectors.\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: Fig. 17. Common crystal form of spinel.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Tektite (Bediasite)\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Composition_: A natural glass, approximately 75% SiO₂, 15% Al₂O₃, 4%\r\n  FeO, also MgO, Na₂O, K₂O, and traces of other elements. _Crystal\r\n  structure_: amorphous. _Hardness_: 5 to 6. _Specific gravity_: 2.33 to\r\n  2.44. _Luster_: vitreous, often dull on weathered surfaces. _Color_:\r\n  dark brown, greenish brown, appears black in thick sections. _Streak_:\r\n  uncolored. _Cleavage_: none. _Fracture_: conchoidal. _Tenacity_:\r\n  brittle. _Diaphaneity_: transparent to subtransparent. _Refractive\r\n  index_: 1.488 to 1.512.\r\n\r\nThe average bediasite size is about 1 inch in diameter, although\r\nspecimens approximately 3 inches in diameter are known. The uncut\r\ntektites are very interesting, showing a variety of shapes and surface\r\nfeatures (Pl. V, A) and many exhibit contorted flow structure. The\r\nsurface of many tektites is grooved or furrowed, while on others it is\r\nsmooth or frosted. The Texas tektites are known as “bediasites,” after\r\nplace names in Grimes County traceable to the Bedias Indians who\r\nformerly lived there.\r\n\r\nDark brown and greenish-brown tektites have been found in Texas in\r\ngravels at scattered localities in Walker, Grimes, Brazos, Burleson,\r\nLee, Fayette, Gonzales, Lavaca, and DeWitt counties. Outside of Texas\r\nthe only other authenticated tektite localities in the United States at\r\nthe present time are in Dodge and Irwin counties, Georgia. A fragment of\r\na similar tektite has recently been reported from near Martha’s\r\nVineyard, Massachusetts. The tektites reported from Oklahoma are now\r\nknown to be pebbles of obsidian.\r\n\r\nAlthough tektites have little value or beauty as gemstones, they have\r\nbeen cut by lapidaries as both faceted and cabochon stones. Tektites\r\ntake a high polish but are mostly so dark in color that they appear\r\nblack.\r\n\r\nThe origin of tektites is of great scientific interest and is currently\r\nthe subject of much debate. Some scientists believe that tektites are of\r\nmeteoritic origin, while others believe that tektites were formed by\r\nvarious terrestrial processes. Since no one has actually observed a\r\ntektite to fall or form, and many of the theories of origin are\r\ndifficult to prove without direct observation, the origin of tektites is\r\nlikely to remain in controversy for some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Topaz\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Composition_: Al₂(F, OH)₂SiO₄. _Crystal system_: orthorhombic.\r\n  _Hardness_: 8. _Specific gravity_: 3.4 to 3.6. _Luster_: vitreous.\r\n  _Color_: pale blue, sky blue, greenish, white, wine yellow, straw\r\n  yellow, grayish, pink, reddish, and orange. _Streak_: uncolored.\r\n  _Cleavage_: one direction, basal, highly perfect. _Fracture_:\r\n  conchoidal to uneven. _Tenacity_: brittle. _Diaphaneity_: transparent\r\n  to subtranslucent. _Refractive index_: about 1.60 to 1.63.\r\n  _Dispersion_: moderate.\r\n\r\nVarious yellow and smoky colored quartz gems are offered for sale as\r\n“Spanish Topaz,” “Smoky Topaz,” “Madeira Topaz,” and “Topaz Quartz.”\r\nThese names are entirely misleading and should be dropped from usage.\r\n\r\nFine gem-quality white, pale-blue, and sky-blue topaz has been found\r\nnear Streeter, Grit, and Katemcy, Mason County. This Texas gem material\r\ncompares favorably in color, size, and clarity with topaz found anywhere\r\nin the United States. Fine crystals of topaz (Pl. V, B, and fig. 18)\r\noccasionally are found in pegmatite dikes associated with quartz, black\r\ntourmaline, cassiterite, and pink microcline. Many of the gem-bearing\r\npegmatites have been eroded away, leaving the topaz concentrated in the\r\nstream beds. The stones mostly occur as frosted, stream-worn pebbles\r\n(Pl. VI, A) in the numerous small creeks in the area. The topaz is\r\nheavier than the quartz and microcline that compose the stream gravel\r\nand is commonly found immediately on top of the granite bed-rock in the\r\nbottom of the stream bed. The stones tend to lodge behind boulders or\r\nsmall dikes cutting across the stream.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Fig. 18. Crystal faces on topaz crystal shown in Plate\r\n  V, B. This crystal habit is typical of the topaz from Mason County.]\r\n\r\nThe white or colorless stones are by far the most common, outnumbering\r\nthe bluish stones about ten to one. The color of the blue stones tends\r\nto be irregularly distributed in zones parallel to the crystal faces.\r\nTopaz that is colored in this manner should be cut with the best blue\r\ncolor near the bottom or culet of the gem (fig. 19). If done correctly,\r\nthis will give the entire gemstone the desirable blue color.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19. Cross section showing the proper orientation of\r\n    dark-color zone in a gem cut from an irregularly colored stone.]\r\n\r\n  COLORLESS\r\n  BLUE\r\n\r\nThe colorless stones can be turned pale yellow, yellowish brown, or\r\nstraw yellow by exposure to X-ray radiation, and some of the bluish\r\nstones will fluoresce faintly yellowish under ultra-violet light.\r\n\r\nThe largest gem-quality topaz crystal yet found in North America has\r\ncome from Mason County. It is a pale-blue crystal weighing 1,296 grams,\r\nnow in the collection of the U.S. National Museum. Several other large\r\npieces, some weighing over a pound, have been found. One large crystal,\r\nexact weight unknown, was found near Katemcy. Several gem cutters have\r\nestimated that this stone could easily yield a single, flawless\r\npale-blue gem of about 500 carats. Many large gems have been cut from\r\ntopaz found in this area, including at least one stone of over 300\r\ncarats.\r\n\r\nOne obstacle in the cutting of topaz is its perfect basal cleavage. The\r\ngemstone should be oriented so that no facet of the stone will be\r\nparallel to or within less than about 5 degrees of the cleavage\r\ndirection, or the facet may be very difficult or impossible to polish.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to estimate the productivity of this area since its\r\ndiscovery in the early 1900’s. Few systematic attempts have been made to\r\nexploit the deposits, and a great amount of the topaz thus far recovered\r\nhas been found by private collectors. The Mason County topaz deposits\r\nare still very productive, and additional exploration may uncover even\r\nmore gem-producing areas.\r\n\r\nTopaz has also been found in stream gravels or pegmatites in Burnet,\r\nLlano, Gillespie, and El Paso counties but very rarely in gem quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Tourmaline\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Composition_: H₉Al₃(B·OH)₂Si₄O₁₉; hydrogen often replaced by iron,\r\n  magnesium, calcium, or fluorine. _Crystal system_: hexagonal.\r\n  _Hardness_: 7 to 7.5. _Specific gravity_: 2.98 to 3.20. _Luster_:\r\n  vitreous to resinous. _Color_: black, brownish black, brown, blue,\r\n  green, red, pink, yellow, and gray. _Streak_: uncolored. _Cleavage_:\r\n  two directions, very imperfect. _Fracture_: subconchoidal to uneven.\r\n  _Tenacity_: brittle. _Diaphaneity_: transparent to opaque. _Refractive\r\n  index_: about 1.62 to 1.64.\r\n\r\nBlack tourmaline is schorl; brown tourmaline, dravite.\r\n\r\nGood crystals of black and dark brown tourmaline occur at Town Mountain\r\nnear Llano, Llano County. The tourmaline crystals average about 1 inch\r\nin length, do not commonly exceed 2 inches, and are associated with\r\nwhite vein quartz. The quartz completely encloses the tourmaline, but\r\nthe crystals can be broken free or the quartz can be trimmed away with\r\nthe use of a diamond saw. The latter procedure is recommended whenever\r\npossible, for it is very easy to shatter the tourmaline crystals while\r\ntrying to remove them from the quartz by other means. Many of the\r\ncrystals are completely unsuitable for cutting, being too brittle or too\r\nbadly cracked and flawed. However, some small crystals have been found\r\nthat are of sufficient quality and size to yield flawless stones of a\r\nfew carats. Few of these stones have been cut since the tourmaline is so\r\ndark that it appears opaque, and few persons find a gem of this nature\r\nattractive.\r\n\r\nGood black and dark brown crystals of tourmaline associated with\r\nandalusite and graphite occur in the Packsaddle schist (Precambrian)\r\nnear Sunrise Beach, Llano County (Pl. VI, B, and fig. 20). Although\r\ngenerally smaller in diameter than the crystals found at Town Mountain,\r\nthey commonly exceed 3 inches in length, although the average size is a\r\nlittle over 1 inch. Many of these crystals are suitable for cutting into\r\nopaque or nearly opaque stones of about 5 or 6 carats.\r\n\r\nBlack tourmaline has also been found in Hudspeth and Culberson counties\r\nbut not of sufficient quality to be used as a gemstone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20. Common crystal form of Llano County tourmaline.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Turquoise\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Composition_: hydrous phosphate of aluminum and copper. _Crystal\r\n  system_: triclinic. _Hardness_: 5 to 6. _Specific gravity_: variable,\r\n  2.6 to about 2.8. _Luster_: dull, sometimes waxy. _Color_: sky blue to\r\n  greenish blue. _Streak_: white to greenish. _Cleavage_: none in\r\n  massive material, two directions in crystals. _Fracture_: conchoidal\r\n  to subconchoidal. _Tenacity_: brittle. _Diaphaneity_: subtranslucent\r\n  to opaque. _Refractive index_: 1.61 to 1.65.\r\n\r\nTurquoise of good sky-blue to greenish-blue color has been found a few\r\nmiles southwest of Van Horn, Culberson County. Several shallow pits were\r\ndug at this locality about 1910; however, the amount of turquoise\r\nproduced was small. The main occurrence of the turquoise was in seams\r\nabout 1 millimeter thick along joints in the fine-grained rocks of this\r\narea. Persons who have visited Culberson County more recently report\r\nthat even minute traces of the turquoise are now difficult to find at\r\nthe old prospect pits. However, further prospecting in the area might\r\nyield some additional localities.\r\n\r\nSmall amounts of turquoise have been reported near El Paso, El Paso\r\nCounty, and also in volcanic rocks near the Jeff Davis-Brewster County\r\nline, north of Alpine.\r\n\r\nA small amount of turquoise has been mined from several localities a few\r\nmiles northwest of Sierra Blanca in the Sierra Blanca Mountains of\r\nHudspeth County.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GLOSSARY\r\n\r\n\r\n  Amorphous—without definite molecular structure; not crystalline.\r\n  Baroque stone—an irregularly shaped, polished stone; usually applied\r\n          to tumbled stones.\r\n  Baroque pearl—an irregularly shaped pearl.\r\n  Brilliancy—reflecting much light; having brightness.\r\n  Brilliant cut—a mode of arrangement of facets commonly used on round\r\n          or oval stones.
