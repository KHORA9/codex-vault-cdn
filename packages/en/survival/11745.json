This fact is illustrated in\r\nevery chapter of the excellent and comprehensive work now before us\r\n[1].\r\n\r\nIn a previous article, (see the number for June 1842,) we\r\nillustrated at some length the connexion which now exists, and which\r\nhereafter must become more intimate, between practical agriculture\r\nand modern science. We showed by what secret and silent steps the\r\nprogress and gradual diffusion of modern scientific discoveries had\r\nimperceptibly led to great improvements in the agriculture of the\r\npresent century--by what other more open and manifest applications\r\nof science it had directly, and in the eyes of all, been\r\nadvanced--to what useful practical discussions the promulgation of\r\nscientific opinions had given rise--and to what better practice such\r\ndiscussions had eventually led. Above all, we earnestly solicited\r\nthe attention of the friends of agriculture to what science seemed\r\nnot only capable of doing, but anxious also to effect, for the\r\nfurther advance of this important art--what new lessons to give, new\r\nsuggestions to offer, and new means of fertility to place in the\r\nhands of, the skilful experimental farmer.\r\n\r\nIt is but a comparatively short time since that article was written,\r\nand yet the spread of sound opinion, of correct and enlightened views,\r\nand of a just appreciation, as well of the aids which science is\r\ncapable of giving to agriculture, as of the expediency of availing\r\nourselves of all these aids, which within that period has taken\r\nplace among practical men, has really surprised us. Nor have we been\r\nless delighted by the zeal with which the pursuit of scientific\r\nknowledge, in its relations to agriculture, has been entered upon in\r\nevery part of the empire--by the progress which has been made in the\r\nacquisition of this knowledge--and by the numerous applications\r\nalready visible of the important principles and suggestions embodied\r\nin the works then before us, (JOHNSTON's _Lectures and Elements of\r\nAgricultural Chemistry and Geology_.) But on this important topic we\r\ndo not at present dwell. We may have occasion to return to the\r\nsubject in a future number, and in the mean time we refer our\r\nreaders to the remarks contained in our previous article.\r\n\r\nThe truly scientific man--among those, we mean, who devote themselves\r\nto such studies as are susceptible of important applications to the\r\naffairs and pursuits of daily life--the truly scientific man does\r\nnot despise the _practice_ of any art, in which he sees the\r\nprinciples he investigates embodied and made useful in promoting the\r\nwelfare of his fellow-men. He does not even undervalue it--he rather\r\nupholds and magnifies its importance, as the agent or means by which\r\nhis greatest and best discoveries can be made to subserve their\r\ngreatest and most beneficent end. In him this may possibly arise\r\nfrom no unusual liberality of mind; it may spring from a selfish\r\ndesire to see the principles he has established or made his own\r\ncarried out to their legitimate extent, and their value established\r\nand acknowledged--_for it is the application of a principle that\r\nimparts to it its highest value_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: THE BOOK OF THE FARM. By Henry Stephens.]\r\n\r\nScience is to practical skill in the arts of life as the soul is to\r\nthe body. They are united as faith and works are in concerns of\r\nhigher moment. As both, though separately good, must yet be united\r\nin the finished Christian, so the perfection of husbandry implies\r\nthe union of all the lights of existing theoretical knowledge with\r\nall the skill of the most improved agricultural practice.\r\n\r\nThough such is the belief of those scientific men who are able and\r\nwilling to do the most for practical agriculture, who see most\r\nclearly what _can_ be done for it, and the true line along\r\nwhich agricultural improvement may now most hopefully direct\r\nher course--yet with this opinion the greater part of practical\r\nmen are still far from sympathizing. Some voices even--becoming\r\nevery day more feeble, however, and recurring at more distant\r\nintervals--continue to be raised against the utility and the\r\napplications of science; as if practice with _stationary_ knowledge\r\nwere omnipotent in developing the resources of nature; as if a man,\r\nin a rugged and partially explored country, could have too much\r\nlight to guide his steps.\r\n\r\nIn the history of maritime intercourse there was a time when the\r\ntimid seaman crept from port to port, feeling his cautious and wary\r\nway from headland to headland, and daring no distant voyage where\r\nseas, and winds, and rocks, unknown to him, increased the dangers of\r\nhis uncertain life. Then a bolder race sprung up--tall ships danced\r\nproudly upon the waves, and many brave hearts manned and guided them;\r\nyet still they rarely ventured from sight of land. Men became\r\nbewildered still, perplexed, and full of fear, when sea and sky\r\nalone presented themselves. But a third period arose--and in the same\r\ncircumstances, men not more brave appeared collected, fearless, and\r\nfull of hope. Faith in a trembling needle gave confidence to the\r\nmost timorous, and neither the rough Atlantic nor the wide Pacific\r\ncould deter the bold adventurer, or the curious investigator of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it was not till this comparatively advanced stage of the\r\nnautical art--when man had obtained a faithful guide in his most\r\ndevious and trackless wanderings--when he was apparently set free\r\nfrom the unsteady dominion of the seas and of the fickle winds--and\r\namid his labyrinthine course could ever and at once turn his face\r\ntowards his happy and expectant home;--it was not till this period\r\nthat science began to lend her most useful and most extensive aids,\r\nand that her value in the advancement of the sailor's art began to\r\nbe justly appreciated. The astronomer forthwith taught him more\r\naccurately to observe the heavens, and compiled laborious tables for\r\nhis daily use. Geography and hydrography obtained higher estimation,\r\nand harbour-engineering and ship-building were elevated into more\r\nimportant separate arts, chiefly from their applications to his use.\r\nNautical schools and nautical surveys, and lighthouse boards, with\r\nall their attendant scientific researches, and magnetic observations,\r\nand voyages of discovery all sprung up--at once the causes and the\r\nconsequences of the advancement of his art towards perfection; and\r\nlatest, though yet far from being the last, all the new knowledge\r\nthat belongs to steam-navigation has been incorporated in the vast\r\nbody of nautical science. _The further an art advances, the more\r\nnecessary does science become to it_.\r\n\r\nThus it is with agriculture. It cannot be denied that the tillage of\r\nthe soil, with almost every other branch of husbandry, has made\r\nlarge strides among us--that we have more productive and better\r\ncultivated provinces, and more skilful farmers, than are to be found\r\nin any other part of the world in which equal disadvantages of\r\nclimate prevail. Any one will readily satisfy himself of this, who,\r\nwith an agricultural eye, shall visit the other parts of Europe to\r\nwhich the same northern sky is common with ourselves. And it is\r\nbecause we have reached this pitch of improvement--at which many\r\nthink we ought to be content to stop--because we have dismissed our\r\nfrail and diminutive boats, and sail now in majestic and decorated\r\nships, provided with such abundant stores that we need not, night by\r\nnight, to seek the harbour for new supplies--that we begin to feel\r\nthe want of some directing principle--to look about for some\r\nfavouring star to guide our wanderings upon the deep. To the\r\ntremblirg needle of science we must now turn to point our way.\r\nFeeble and uncertain it may itself appear--wavering as it directs\r\nus--and therefore by many may be depreciated and despised--yet it\r\nwill surely lead us right if we have faith in its indications. Let\r\nthe practical man then build his ships skilfully and well after the\r\nbest models, and of the soundest oak--let their timbers be Kyanized,\r\ntheir cables of iron, their cordage and sails of the most approved\r\nmake and material--let their sailors be true men and fearless, and\r\nlet stores be providently laid in for the voyage; but let not the\r\ntrembling needle of science be forgotten; for though the distant\r\nharbour he would gain be well known to him--without the aid of the\r\nneedle he may never be able to reach it.\r\n\r\nIn thus rigging out his ship--in other words, in fitting up his farm\r\nand doing all for it, and upon it, which experience and skilful\r\npractice can suggest--he cannot have a better guide than the book\r\nnow before us.\r\n\r\nTHE BOOK OF THE FARM is not a mere didactic treatise on practical\r\nagriculture, of which we already possess several of deserved\r\nreputation; nor yet a laborious compilation, systematically arranged,\r\nof every thing which, in the opinion of the author, it should\r\ninterest the farmer to know. Of such Cyclopædias, that of Loudon\r\nwill not soon find a rival. But, as its name implies, The _Book of\r\nthe Farm_ contains a detail of all the operations, the more minute\r\nas well as the greater, which the husbandman will be called upon to\r\nundertake upon his farm--in the exact order in point of time in\r\nwhich they will successively demand his attention. Beginning at the\r\nclose of the agricultural year, when the crops are reaped and housed,\r\nand the long winter invites to new and peculiar, and, as they may be\r\ncalled, preparatory labours, the reader is taught what work in each\r\nsucceeding month and season should be undertaken--why at that season\r\nfor what purpose it is to be done-in what way it can best be\r\nperformed--how at the least cost of money and the smallest waste of\r\ntime--and _how the master may at all times ascertain if his work has\r\nbeen efficiently performed_.\r\n\r\nWe confess that we have been much struck with the wide range of\r\n_practical_ subjects on which the author gives, in such a way a to\r\nshow that he is himself familiar with them, the most minute\r\ndirections for the guidance at once of the master farmer himself,\r\nand for the direction of those who are under his orders. We have\r\nsatisfied ourselves that by carefully _examining_ the contents of\r\nthis one book, we should be prepared not merely to pass an\r\nexamination, but actually to undertake the office of public examiner\r\nin any or all of the several crafts and mysteries of the farm-builder,\r\nthe weather-seer, the hedge-planter, the ditcher, the drainer, the\r\nploughman, the cattle-feeder, the stock-buyer, the drover, the\r\npig-killer, the fat cattle seller, the butcher, the miller, and the\r\ngrieve or general overseer of the farm. We know not what other\r\ngentle crafts the still unpublished parts of the work may hereafter\r\nteach us; but so faithfully and so minutely, in general so clearly,\r\nand with so much apparent enjoyment, does the author enter into the\r\ndetails of all the above lines of life, that we have been deceived\r\n(we suppose) into the persuasion that Mr. Stephens must, in his\r\nlifetime, have \"played many parts\"--that he has himself, as occasion\r\noffered, or as work fell in his way, engaged in every one of these\r\nas well as of the other varied occupations it falls in his way to\r\ndescribe.\r\n\r\nHow, otherwise, for instance, should he so well understand the\r\nduties and habits, and sympathize with the privations and simple\r\nenjoyments of the humble and way-worn drover?--\r\n\r\n\"A drover of sheep should always be provided with a dog, as the\r\nnumbers and nimbleness of sheep render it impossible for one man to\r\nguide a capricious flock along a road subject to many casualties;\r\nnot a young dog, who is apt to work and bark a great deal more than\r\nnecessary, much to the annoyance of the sheep--but a knowing\r\ncautious tyke. The drover should have a walking stick, a useful\r\ninstrument at times in turning a sheep disposed to break off from\r\nthe rest. A shepherd's plaid he will find to afford comfortable\r\nprotection to his body from cold and wet, while the mode in which it\r\nis worn leaves his limbs free for motion. He should carry provision\r\nwith him, such as bread, meat, cheese or butter, that he may take\r\nluncheon or dinner quietly beside his flock, while resting in a\r\nsequestered part of the road; and he may slake his thirst in the\r\nfirst brook or spring he finds, or purchase a bottle of ale at a\r\nroadside ale-house. Though exposed all day to the air, and even\r\nthough he feel cold, he should avoid drinking spirits, which only\r\nproduce temporary warmth, and for a long time after induce chilliess\r\nand languor. Much rather let him reserve the allowance of spirits he\r\ngives himself until the evening, when he can _enjoy it in warm toddy\r\nbeside a comfortable fire_, before retiring to rest for the night.\"\r\n--Vol. ii. p. 89.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen how knowingly he treats of the fat upon the sheep:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The formation of fat in a sheep commences in the inside, the\r\n_net_ of fat which envelopes the intestines being first formed.\r\nAfter that, fat is seen on the outside, and first upon the end of\r\nthe rump at the tail head, which continues to move on along the back,\r\non both sides of the spine to the bend of the ribs, to the neck. Then\r\nit is deposited between the muscles, parallel with the cellular\r\ntissue. Meanwhile it is covering the lower round of the ribs,\r\ndescending to the flanks until the two sides meet under the belly,\r\nfrom whence it proceeds to the brisket or breast in front and the\r\nshaw behind, filling up the inside of the arm-pits and thighs. The\r\nspaces around the fibres of the muscles are the last to receive a\r\ndeposition of fat, but after this has begun, every other part\r\nsimultaneously receives its due share, the back and kidneys\r\nreceiving the most--so much so that the former literally becomes\r\n_nicked_, as it is termed; that is, the fat is felt through the\r\nskin to be divided into two portions. When all this has been\r\naccomplished, the sheep is said to be _fat_ or _ripe_.\"--Vol. ii. p.\r\n93.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the enjoyment of tracing the accumulating fat is not enough for\r\nour author--as soon as his sheep is ripe, he forthwith proceeds to\r\nslaughter it; and though he describes every part of this process\r\naccurately, and with true professional relish, coolly telling us,\r\nthat \"the _operation_ is unattended with cruelty;\" yet we must be\r\ncontent to refer our readers to the passage (vol. ii. p. 96) as an\r\nillustration of his skill in this interesting branch of farm-surgery.\r\nHe is really an amiable sheep-operator, our author--what placid\r\nbenevolence and hatred of quackery appear in his instructions--\r\n\"Learn to slaughter _gently_, dress the carcass neatly and cleanly,\r\nin as plain a manner as possible, and without _flourishes_.\"--p. 167.\r\n\r\nBut whisky-toddy and fat mutton are not the only things our author\r\nrelishes. He must have been a farm-servant, living in a bothy, at\r\nleast as long as he drove on the road or practised surgery in the\r\nslaughter-house. After describing the farm-servant's wages and mode\r\nof living, he thus expands upon the subject of Scottish brose:--\r\n\r\n\"The oatmeal is usually cooked in one way, as _brose_. A pot of\r\nwater is put on the fire to boil--a task which the men (in the bothy)\r\ntake in turns; a handful or two of oatmeal is taken out of the small\r\nchest with which each man provides himself, and put into a wooden\r\nbowl, which also is the ploughman's property; and, on a hollow being\r\nmade in the meal, and sprinkled with salt, the boiling-water is\r\npoured over the meal, and the mixture receiving a little stirring\r\nwith a horn-spoon, and the allowance of milk poured over it, the\r\nbrose is ready to be eaten; and, as every man makes his own brose,\r\nand knows his own appetite, he makes just as much as he can consume.\" [2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"The fare is simple, and is as simply made, but it must be\r\nwholesome, and capable of supplying the loss of substance occasioned\r\nby hard labour; for I believe that no class of men can endure more\r\nbodily fatigue for ten hours every day, than those ploughmen of\r\nScotland who subsist on this brose three times a-day.\"--Vol. ii. p.\r\n384.]\r\n\r\nBut if the _life_ of the ploughman is familiar to our author, the\r\n_work_ he has to do, and the mode of doing it well, and the reason\r\nwhy it should be done one way here, and another way there, are no\r\nless so. The uninitiated have no idea of the complicated patterns\r\nwhich the ploughman works, according to the nature of the soil and\r\nthe season of the year in which he labours. He may be \"gathering\r\nup--crown-and-furrow ploughing--casting, or yoking, or coupling\r\nridges--casting ridges with gore furrows--cleaving down ridges with\r\nor without gore furrows--ploughing two-out-and-two-in--ploughing in\r\nbreaks--cross-furrowing--angle-ploughing, ribbing, and drilling--or\r\nhe may be preparing the land by feering or striking the ridges.\"--\r\n(Vol. i. p. 464.) All these methods of turning up the land are\r\ndescribed and illustrated by wood-cuts, and we are sure quite as\r\neffectually done upon paper as if the author had been explaining\r\nthem upon his own farm, guiding one of his own best ploughs, and\r\nstrengthened by a basin of good brose made from his own meal-chest.\r\n\r\nBut the practical skill of Mr. Stephens is not confined to the lower\r\nwalks of the agricultural life. The ploughman sometimes qualifies\r\nhimself to become a steward, that he may rid himself of the drudgery\r\nof working horses. He has then new duties to perform, which are thus\r\ngenerally described.\r\n\r\n\"The duty of the _steward_ or _grieve_, as he is called in some\r\nparts of Scotland, and _bailiff_ in England, consists in receiving\r\ngeneral instructions from his master, the farmer, which he sees\r\nexecuted by the people under his charge. He exercises a direct\r\ncontrol over the ploughmen and field-workers.... It is his duty to\r\nenforce the commands of his master, and to check every deviation\r\nfrom rectitude he may observe in the servants against his interests.\r\nIt is not generally understood that he has control over the shepherd,\r\nthe hedger, or the cattleman, who are stewards, in one sense, over\r\ntheir respective departments of labour.... He should always deliver\r\nthe daily allowance of corn to the horses. _He should be the first\r\nperson out of bed in the morning, and the last in it at night_. On\r\nmost farms, he sows the seed in spring, superintends the\r\nfield-workers in summer, tends the harvest-field and builds the\r\nstacks in autumn, and thrashes the corn with the mill, and cleans it\r\nwith the winnowing-machine in winter. He keeps an account of the\r\nworkpeople's time, and of the quantity of grain thrashed, consumed\r\non the farm, and delivered to purchasers.\"--Vol. i. p. 221.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe practical man who reads the above detail of the steward's duties,\r\nwill see at once that it must have been written by \"one of themselves;\"\r\nand, by its correctness, will be able to judge of the full faith\r\nwhich may be placed in the numerous other details upon every branch\r\nof practical farming with which the work now before us is so full.\r\n\r\nWe have brought prominently forward the above extracts in relation to\r\nthe _minutiae_ of the farmer's life--to the detailed practical\r\nknowledge which is so valuable to him, as being those upon which it\r\nappeared to us that a writer who was capable of getting up a book at\r\nall, much more such a book as this professes to be, in reference to\r\nthe higher branches of the farmers' art, was most likely to fail.\r\nBut these parts of the work are written not only knowingly and well,\r\nbut with an evident relish for the subject. Let us turn, therefore,\r\nto the more intellectual part of the book, and see how far this part\r\nof the task has been satisfactorily accomplished.\r\n\r\n_The Book of the Farm_ is mainly intended as a manual for the\r\nmaster-farmer, accompanying him every where, and at every season of\r\nthe year, counselling, guiding, and directing him in all his\r\noperations. But it has a higher and more useful aim than merely to\r\nremind the practical agriculturist of what he already knows. It is\r\nfitted, without other aid, to teach the beginner nearly every thing\r\nwhich it is necessary for him to know in order to take his place\r\namong the most intelligent practical men; and to teach it precisely\r\nat the time, and in the order, in which it is most easy, most useful,\r\nand most interesting for him to learn it.\r\n\r\nThe beginner is supposed by Mr. Stephens to have undergone a previous\r\ncourse of instruction under a practical man, and to enter upon a\r\nfarm of his own in the beginning of winter. This farm is a more or\r\nless naked and unimproved piece of land, without a farm-stead or\r\nfarm-house, with few hedge-rows, and wholly undrained. On entering\r\nthe farm, also, he has servants to engage, stock to buy, and\r\nimplements to select. In all these difflculties, _The Book of the\r\nFarm_ comes to his aid. The most useful, approved, and economical\r\nform of a farm-steading is pointed out. The structure of barns,\r\nstables, cow-houses, piggeries, _liquid-manure tanks_, poultry-yards,\r\nand every other appendage of the farm-house, and, finally, the most\r\nfitting construction of the farm-house itself, according to the size\r\nand situation of the farm, are discussed, described, and explained.\r\nPlans and estimates of every expense are added, and woodcuts\r\nillustrative of every less known suggestion. These are not only\r\nsufficient to guide the intelligent young farmer in all the\r\npreliminary arrangements for his future comfort and success, but will,\r\nwe are sure, supply hints to many older heads for the reconstruction\r\nor improvement of farm-steadings, heretofore deemed convenient and\r\ncomplete. The following chapter aids him in the choice of his\r\nservants, and describes distinctly the duties and province of each.\r\n\r\nAnd now, having concluded his domestic arrangements, [3] he must\r\nlearn to know something of the weather which prevails in the\r\ndistrict in which he has settled, before he can properly plan out or\r\ndirect the execution of the various labours which are to be\r\nundertaken upon his farm during the winter. A chapter of some length,\r\ntherefore, is devoted to the \"weather in winter,\" in which the\r\nprinciples by which the weather is regulated in the different parts\r\nof our islands, and the methods of foreseeing or predicting changes,\r\nare described and illustrated _as far as they are known_. This is the\r\nfirst of those chapters of _The Book of the Farm_ which illustrates\r\nin a way not to be mistaken, the truth announced at the head of this\r\narticle, that _skilful practice is applied science_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Hesiod considered one other appendage to the homestead\r\nindispensable, to which Mr. Stephens does not allude, perhaps from\r\nfeeling himself incompetent to advise.]\r\n\r\nTo some it may appear at first sight that our author has indulged in\r\ntoo much detail upon this subject; but he is not a true practical\r\nfarmer who says so. The weather has always been a most interesting\r\nsubject to the agriculturist--he is every day, in nearly all his\r\nmovements, dependant upon it. A week of rain, or of extraordinary\r\ndrought, or of nipping frost, may disappoint his most sanguine and\r\nbest founded expectations. His daily comfort, his yearly profit, and\r\nthe general welfare of his family, all depend upon the weather, or\r\nupon his _skill in foreseeing its changes_, and availing himself of\r\nevery moment which is favourable to his purposes. Hence, with\r\nagricultural writers, from the most early times, the varied\r\nappearances of the clouds, the nature of the winds, and the changing\r\naspects of the sun and moon, and their several significations, have\r\nformed a favourite subject of description and discussion. Thus of\r\nthe sun Virgil says--\r\n\r\n  \"Sol quoque, et exoriens et quum se condet in undas,\r\n  Signa dabit; solem certissima signa sequuntir.\r\n  Et quae mane refert, et quae surgentibus astris.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then he gives the following _prognostics_, as unerring guides to\r\nthe Latian farmer:--\r\n\r\n  \"Ille ubi nascentem maculis variaverit ortum,\r\n  Conditus in nubem, medioque refugerit orbe;\r\n  Suspecti tibi sint imbres....\r\n  Caeruleus pluviam denuntiat, igneus Euros.\r\n  At si quum referetque diem condit que relatum\r\n  Lucidus orbis erit: frustra terrebere nimbis\r\n  Et claro silvas cernes aquilone moveri.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stephens recognises similar solar indications in the following\r\nrhymes:--\r\n\r\n  \"If the sun in red should set,\r\n  The next day surely will be wet;\r\n  If the sun should set in grey,\r\n  The next will be a rainy day.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again--\r\n\r\n  \"An evening red, or a morning grey,\r\n  Doth betoken a bonnie day;\r\n  In an evening grey and a morning red,\r\n  Put on your hat, or ye'll weet your head.\"\r\n\r\nIn his next edition we recommend to Mr. Stephens's notice the Border\r\nversion of the latter:--\r\n\r\n  \"An evening red and a morning grey,\r\n  Send the shepherd on his way;\r\n  An evening grey and a morning red\r\n  Send the shepherd wet to bed.\"\r\n\r\nThe most learned meteorologists of the present day believe the moon\r\nto influence the weather--the practical farmer is sure of it--and we\r\nhave known the result of the hay crop, in adjoining farms, to be\r\nstrikingly different, when upon the one the supposed influence of\r\nthe time of change was taken into account and acted upon, while in\r\nthe other it was neglected. Mr. Stephens gives as true proverbs--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"In the wane of the moon,\r\n  A cloudy morning bodes a fair afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nAnd\r\n\r\n  \"New moon's mist\r\n  Never dies of thirst.\"\r\n\r\nBut Virgil is more specific--\r\n\r\n  \"Ipsa dies alios alio dedit ordine Luna\r\n  Felices operum; quintam fuge....\r\n  Septuma post decumam felix et ponere vitem,\r\n  Et prensos domitare boves.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in these warnings he only imitates Hesiod--\r\n\r\n  [Greek: Pempias de hexaleasthai, hepei chalepai te chai ainai.]\r\n\r\nAnd\r\n\r\n  [Greek: Maenos de isamenou trischaidecha taen haleasthai,\r\n  Spezmatos azxasthai phuta de henthzepsasthai arisa.]\r\n\r\nBut the vague prognostics of old times are not sufficient for the\r\nguidance of the skilful and provident farmer of our day. The\r\nbarometer, the thermometer, and even the hygrometer, should be his\r\ncompanions and guides, or occasional counsellors. To the description\r\nand useful indications of these instruments, therefore, a sufficient\r\nspace is devoted in the book before us. We do not know any other\r\nsource from which the practical farmer can draw so much\r\nmeteorological matter specially adapted to his own walk of life, as\r\nfrom this chapter upon the weather.\r\n\r\nAll this our young farmer is not supposed to sit down and master\r\nbefore he proceeds with the proper business of his new farm; it will\r\nbe a subject of study with him in many future months, and winters too.\r\nBut after a most judicious recommendation, to observe and _record_\r\nwhatever occurs either new or interesting in his field of\r\nlabour--without which record he will not be able to contribute, as\r\nhe may hereafter do, to the extension of agricultural knowledge--he\r\nis taught next, in an able chapter \"upon soils and sub-soils,\"\r\nto study the nature of his farm more thoroughly; to ascertain\r\nits natural capabilities--the improvements of which it is\r\nsusceptible--the simplest, most efficacious, and most economical\r\nmeans by which this improvement may be effected--and the kind of\r\nimplements which it will be most prudent in him to purchase for\r\ntilling the kind of land of which his farm consists, or for bringing\r\nit into a more fertile condition. This chapter also draws largely,\r\nespecially upon geological and chemical science, and affords another\r\nillustration of what, I trust, Mr. Stephens's book will more and\r\nmore impress upon our working farmers, that _skilful practice is\r\napplied science_. We have not room for any extracts, but when we\r\nmention that in the chemical part of it the author has been assisted\r\nby Dr. Madden, readers of the _Quarterly Journal of Agriculture_\r\nwill be able to form an estimate of the way in which this chapter\r\nhas been got up.\r\n\r\nHaving now satisfied himself of the nature of his farm as to soil\r\nand capabilities, he sees that new enclosures and shelter will be\r\nnecessary--that some fields must be subdivided, others laid out\r\nanew--that old hedge-rows must be rooted out or straightened, and\r\nnew ones planted in their room. Of what all this may be made to\r\naccomplish for his farm, and of how the work itself may be done,\r\neven to the minutest details, the chapters on \"enclosures and shelter,\"\r\nand on \"planting of farm hedges,\" will fully inform him. The\r\nbenefits of shelter on our elevated lands, are not half understood.\r\nThousands upon thousands of acres are lying in comparative barrenness,\r\nwhich, by adequate shelter, might be converted into productive fields.\r\nThe increase of mean temperature which results from skilful\r\nenclosures, is estimated at 5° to 8° Fahrenheit; while in regard to\r\nthe increased money value, Mr. Thomas Bishop gives the following\r\ntestimony:--\r\n\r\n\"Previous to the division of the common moor of Methven in Perthshire,\r\nin 1793, the venerable Lord Lynedoch and Lord Methven had each\r\nsecured their lower slopes of land adjoining the moor with belts of\r\nplantation. The year following I entered Lord Methven's service, and\r\nin 1798 planted about sixty acres of the higher moor ground, valued\r\nat 2s. per acre, for shelter to eighty or ninety acres set apart for\r\ncultivation, and let in three divisions to six individuals. The\r\nprogress made in improving the land was very slow for the first\r\nfifteen years, but thereafter went on rapidly, being aided by the\r\n_shelter derived from_ the growth of the plantations; and the\r\nwhole has now become fair land, bearing annually crops of oats,\r\nbarley, peas, potatoes, and turnips. In spring 1838, exactly forty\r\nyears from the time of putting down the plantation, I sold four\r\nacres of larch and fir (average growth) standing therein, for L.220,\r\nwhich, with the value of reserved trees and average amount per acre\r\nof thinnings sold previously, gave a return of L.67 per acre.\"--Vol.\r\ni, p. 367.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are satisfied that in localities with which we are ourselves\r\nacquainted, there are tens of thousand of acres which, by the simple\r\nprotection of sheltering plantations, would soon be made to exhibit\r\nan equal improvement with either the moor of Methven, or the lands\r\nupon Shotley Fell, which are also referred to in the work before us.\r\nAt a time when such strenuous endeavours are making to introduce and\r\nextend a more efficient drainage among our clay lands, the more\r\nsimple amelioration of our cold uplands by judicious plantations,\r\nought neither to be lost sight of, nor by those who address\r\nthemselves to the landlords and cultivators, be passed by without\r\nespecial and frequent notice.\r\n\r\nDid space permit, we could have wished to extract a paragraph or two\r\nupon the mode of planting hedges, and forming ditches, for the\r\npurpose of proving to our readers that Mr. Stephens is as complete a\r\n_hedger_ and _ditcher_, as we have seen him to be cunning as a\r\ndrover and a cattle surgeon. But we must refer the reader to the\r\npassages in pp. 376 and 379. Even in the planting of thorn hedges he\r\nwill find that science is not unavailing, for both mathematics and\r\nbotany are made by Mr. Stephens to yield their several contributions\r\nto the chapters we are now considering.\r\n\r\nBut the fields being divided and the hedges planted, or while those\r\noperations are going on, a portion of the land must be subjected to\r\nthe plough. Next in order, therefore, follows a chapter upon this\r\nimportant instrument, in which the merits and uses of the several\r\nbest known--especially of the Scotch swing-ploughs--are explained\r\nand discussed. Here our young farmer is taught which variety of\r\nplough he ought to select for his land, _why_ it is to be preferred,\r\nand _how_ it is to be used, and its movable parts (plough-irons)\r\n_tempered_ and adjusted, according to the effect which the workman\r\nis desirous of producing. We are quite sure that the writer of such\r\nparts of this chapter as refer to the practical use of the plough,\r\nmust himself have handled it for many a day in the field.\r\n\r\nThe part of this chapter, again, which relates to the theoretical\r\nconstruction--to the history of the successive improvements, and to\r\nthe discussion of the relative merits of the numerous varieties of\r\nploughs which have lately been recommended to notice--is drawn up by\r\nMr. James Slight, curator of the museum of the Highland Society, a\r\ngentleman whose authority on such subjects stands deservedly high.\r\nTo this monograph, as we may call it, upon the plough, we may again\r\nrefer as another illustration of the union between agriculture and\r\nscience. Mechanism perfects the construction of instruments,\r\nchemistry explains the effects which they are the means of producing\r\nin the soil--says also to the mechanic, if you could make them act\r\nin such and such a way, these effects would be more constantly and\r\nmore fully brought about, and returns them to the workshop for\r\nfurther improvement. Thus each branch of knowledge aids the other,\r\nand suggests to it means of still further benefitting practical\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting, and not the least important, of those\r\npractical discussions which have arisen since the establishment of\r\nthe Royal Agricultural Society of England, has been in regard to the\r\nrelative merits and lightness of draught of the Scottish\r\nswing-ploughs, and of certain of the wheel-ploughs made and\r\nextensively used, especially in the southern counties. It is admitted,\r\nwe believe, on all hands, that a less skilful workman will execute\r\nas presentable a piece of work with a wheel-plough, as a more\r\nskilful ploughman with a Scotch swing-plough. This is insisted upon\r\nby one party as a great advantage, while the other attaches no\r\nweight to it at all, saying, that they find no difficulty in getting\r\ngood ploughmen to work with the swing-plough, and therefore it would\r\nbe no advantage to them to change. Still this greater facility in\r\nusing it is a true economical advantage, nevertheless; since that\r\nwhich is difficult to acquire will always be purchased at a dearer\r\nrate; and in an improving district, it is some gain, that it is\r\nneither necessary to import very skilful ploughmen, nor to wait till\r\nthey are produced at home.\r\n\r\nBut it is also conceded, we believe, that the swing-plough, in\r\nskilful hands, is more easily or quickly managed than a wheel-plough;\r\nthat it _turns more readily_, and when doing the same kind of work,\r\nwill go over the ground quicker, and consequently do more work in a\r\nday. Theoretically, this seems undeniable, though it does not appear\r\nto be as yet clearly established in what precise proportion this\r\ntheoretical acceleration ought to increase the extent of ground gone\r\nover by a diligent ploughman in the ten hours of his daily labour.\r\nIt is said that, with the wheel-plough, three-fourths of an acre is\r\nan average day's work, while with a swing-plough, an acre is the\r\nordinary and easy work of an active man on soil of average tenacity.\r\nThe _pace_, however, must depend considerably both upon the horses\r\nand their driver; and to whatever extent such a difference may\r\nreally exist--and opinions differ upon the subject--it is clearly an\r\nargument in favour of the swing-plough.\r\n\r\nBut a third and equally important element in the discussion, is the\r\nrelative draught of the swing and wheel-ploughs. This element has\r\nbeen lately brought more prominently forward, in consequence of some\r\ninteresting experiments, made first, we believe, by Mr. Pusey, and\r\nsince repeated by others, as to the relative draught of different\r\nploughs in the same circumstances, as measured by the dynamometer.\r\nThis, as well as the other parts of this question, is taken up, and\r\nably discussed, by Mr. Slight; and he has, we think, satisfactorily\r\nshown, that no wheel-plough (or plough with a foot) can be lighter\r\nin draught, _merely because it is wheeled_--that, on the contrary,\r\nits draught must be in some small degree increased, other things\r\nbeing equal, (vol. i. p. 463.) This, we think, is probable, on other\r\ngrounds besides those stated by Mr. Slight; yet there appears\r\nsatisfactory reason for believing, that some of the wheel-ploughs\r\nwhich have been made the subject of experiment, have actually been\r\nlighter in draught, when doing the same work, than any of the\r\nswing-ploughs that have been opposed to them. But this does not show\r\nthat, in _principle_, the swing-plough is not superior to the\r\nwheel-plough--it only shows that, in _construction_, it is still\r\ncapable of great emendations, and that, in this respect, some of the\r\nwheel-ploughs have got the start of it. But the Scotch makers, who\r\nfirst so greatly improved the plough, are capable still of competing\r\nwith their southern rivals; and from their conjoined exertions,\r\nfuture ploughmen are destined to receive still further aid.\r\n\r\nWhen the ploughs are brought home, and while the winter ploughing is\r\ngoing on, an opportunity presents itself for laying out, and probably,\r\nas the weather permits, of cutting a portion of the intended drains.\r\nUpon this important subject, Mr. Stephens treats with more even than\r\nhis usual skill. How true is the following passage:--\r\n\r\n\"Land, however, though it does not contain such a superabundance of\r\nwater as to obstruct arable culture, may nevertheless, by its\r\ninherent wetness, prevent or retard the luxuriant growth of useful\r\nplants, as much as decidedly wet land. The truth is, that deficiency\r\nof crops on apparently dry land is frequently attributed to\r\nunskilful husbandry, when it really arises from the baleful\r\ninfluence of _concealed_ stagnant water; and the want of skill is\r\nshown, not so much in the management of the arable culture of the\r\nland, as in neglecting to remove the true cause of the deficiency of\r\nthe crop, namely, the concealed stagnant water. Indeed, my opinion is,\r\nand its conviction has been forced upon me by long and extensive\r\nobservation of the state of the soil over a large part of the\r\ncountry--that this is the _true cause of most of the bad farming to\r\nbe seen_, and that _not one farm_ is to be found throughout the\r\nkingdom that _would not be much the better for draining_.\"\r\n--Vol. i. p. 483.\r\n\r\nDraining is now truly regarded as a great national work, involving\r\nconsiderations of the highest moment, and bearing upon some of the\r\nmost vital questions of our national policy. It is a subject,\r\ntherefore, the practical discussion of which is of the greatest\r\nimportance, especially in reference to the mode in which it can be\r\nmost _efficiently_ and most _cheaply_ done. Into these points,\r\nMr. Stephens enters minutely, and the course he prescribes is, we\r\nthink, full of judgment. He explains the Elkington mode of draining,\r\nand he gives due praise to the more recent improvements of Mr. Smith\r\nof Deanston.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery one knows how difficult it is to persuade our practical men to\r\nadopt any new method; but even after you have satisfied them that the\r\nadoption of it will really do good to their farms, it is almost as\r\ndifficult to persuade them, that a partial adoption of the method,\r\nor some alteration of it--as they fancy some _improvement_ of\r\nit--will not best suit their land, or the circumstances in which\r\nthey are placed. Thus, one thinks, that a drain in each alternate\r\nfurrow is enough for his soil--that his drains need not be above\r\ntwelve(!) or eighteen inches deep--or that on his clay, the use of\r\nsoles is a needless expense. On all these points, the book before us\r\ngives confident opinions, with which we entirely coincide.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the depth of drains, it is shown, that in order that\r\nthey may _draw_, they should never be shallower than thirty inches,\r\nand should always leave a depth of eighteen inches clear of the\r\ndraining materials, in order that the subsoil and trench plough may\r\nhave full freedom of action, without risk of injury to the drain;\r\nwhile of the use of soles he says--\r\n\r\n\"I am a strenuous advocate for drainsoles _in all cases_; and even\r\nwhen they may really prove of little use, I would rather use too many,\r\nthan too few precautions in draining; because, even in the most\r\nfavourable circumstances, we cannot tell what change may take place\r\nbeyond our view, in the interior of a drain, which we are never again\r\npermitted, and which _we have no desire to see_.\"\r\n\r\nThis passage expresses the true principle of safety, by which, in\r\nthe outlay of large sums of money for improvements, the landowner,\r\nand the holder of an improving lease, ought to be actuated. Though\r\ngreat losses have already been incurred by shallow drains, and by\r\nthe rejection of soles, the practice, especially in the more\r\nbackward districts, still goes on, and thousands of pounds are still\r\nexpended upon the principles of a false economy, in repetition of\r\nthe same faulty practice. We know of drainings now going on to a\r\ngreat extent, which will never permit the use of the subsoil plough;\r\nand of the neglect of soles, upon soils generally of clay, but here\r\nand there with patches of sand, into which the tiles must inevitably\r\nsink. When a person drains his own land, of course reason is the\r\nonly constraint by which he can be withheld from doing as he likes\r\nwith his own; or where a yearly tenant drains part of his farm at\r\nhis own expense, the risk is exclusively his, and his landlord, who\r\nperhaps refuses to give any effectual aid, can have no right to\r\ndictate as to the mode in which the draining is to be performed; but\r\nwhen the landlord contributes either directly or indirectly to the\r\nexpense, he, or his agent--if he has one who is skilful\r\nenough--should insist upon every thing being done according to the\r\nmost improved, which, in reality, are also ultimately the most\r\neconomical principles.\r\n\r\nWhile the draining thus proceeds on the best and most economical\r\nprinciples, the ploughing is supposed to be still in progress.\r\nIndeed the arrangements for the two operations, the selection and\r\npurchase of the implements for both, may go on simultaneously. The\r\nplough, indeed, is sometimes used as a draining implement for making\r\na deep furrow, in which, with more or less emendation from the spade,\r\nthe tiles or other draining materials may subsequently be laid. But\r\nin this case, the draught is excessive, and many horses must often\r\nbe yoked into the same plough, in order to drag it through the ground.\r\nHere, therefore, the young farmer must learn a new art--the art of\r\nharnessing and yoking his horses, in such a way as to obtain the\r\ngreatest possible effect, at the least expense, or with the smallest\r\nwaste of animal strength. This is a very important subject for\r\nconsideration, and it is one which the author who is best acquainted\r\nwith the practice, and with the state of knowledge regarding it,\r\nover a great part of our island, will feel himself most imperatively\r\ncalled upon to treat of in detail. This is done, accordingly, in the\r\nchapter upon the \"Yoking and Harnessing of the Plough,\" in which, by\r\nthe able assistance of Mr. Slight, the principles upon which these\r\nprocesses should be conducted, as well as the simplest, strongest,\r\nand most economical methods, in actual practice among the most\r\nskilful farmers, are illustrated and explained.\r\n\r\nTo this follows a chapter upon \"Ploughing stubble and lea ground,\"\r\nin which, with the aid of his two coadjutors, the practical and\r\nscientific questions involved in the general process of ploughing\r\nsuch land, are discussed with equal skill and judgment. We have been\r\nparticularly pleased with the remarks of Mr. Slight upon\r\nploughing-matches, (Vol. i. p. 651,) in reference especially to the\r\ngeneral disregard among judges, of the nature of the _underground_\r\nwork, on which so much of the good effects of ploughing in reality\r\ndepends. They will, we doubt not, have their due weight, at future\r\nploughing-matches, among those--and we hope they will be many--into\r\nwhose hands the work before us may come.\r\n\r\nSecond in importance to draining only, are the subjects of \"subsoil\r\nand trench ploughing,\" operations which are also to be performed at\r\nthis season of the year--and a chapter upon which concludes the\r\nfirst volume of Mr. Stephens's work. Those who are acquainted with\r\nthe writings of Mr. Smith of Deanston, and with the operations of\r\nthe Marquis of Tweeddale at Yester, will duly estimate the importance,\r\nnot merely to the young farmer himself, but to the nation at large,\r\nof proper instruction in regard to these two important operations--in\r\nthe mode of economically conducting them--in the principles upon\r\nwhich their beneficial action depends--and in the circumstances by\r\nwhich the practical man ought to be regulated in putting the one or\r\nthe other, or the one _rather_ than the other, in operation upon his\r\nown land. Our limits do not permit us to discuss the relative merits\r\nof subsoil and trench ploughing, which by some writers have unwisely\r\nbeen pitted against each other--as if they were in reality methods\r\nof improving the land, either of which a man may equally adopt in\r\nany soil and under all circumstances. But they, in reality, agree\r\nuniversally only in this one thing--_that neither process will\r\nproduce a permanently good effect unless the land be previously\r\nthorough-drained_. But being drained, the farmer must then exercise\r\na sound discretion, and Mr. Stephens's book will aid his judgment\r\nmuch in determining which of the two subsequent methods he ought to\r\nadopt. The safer plan for the young farmer would be to try one or\r\ntwo acres in each way, and in his after procedure upon the same kind\r\nof land to be regulated by the result of this trial. Mr. Stephens\r\nexpresses a decided opinion in favour of trench-ploughing in the\r\nfollowing passages:--\r\n\r\n\"I have no hesitation in expressing my preference of trench to\r\nsubsoil ploughing: and I cannot see a single instance, with the sole\r\nexception of turning up a very bad subsoil in large quantity, in\r\nwhich there is any advantage attending subsoil, that cannot be\r\nenjoyed by trench ploughing: and for this single drawback of a very\r\nbad subsoil, trenching has the advantage of being performed in\r\nperfect safety, where subsoil ploughing could not be, without\r\nprevious drainage.\r\n\r\n\"But whilst giving a preference to trench ploughing over subsoil, I\r\nam of opinion that it should not be generally attempted under any\r\ncircumstances, however favourable, without previous thorough-draining,\r\nany more than subsoil ploughing; but when so drained, there is no\r\nmode of management, in my opinion, that will render land so soon\r\namenable to the means of putting it in a high degree of fertility as\r\ntrench ploughing.\"--Vol. i. p. 664.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe confess that, in the first of the above passages, Mr. Stephens\r\nappears to us to assume something of the tone of a partizan, which\r\nhas always the effect of lessening the weight of an author's opinion\r\nwith the intelligent reader who is in search of the truth only. What\r\nis advanced as the main advantage of trench-ploughing in the first\r\npassage--that it can be safely done without previous draining, is in\r\nthe second wholly discarded by the advice, _never to trench-plough\r\nwithout previous draining_. At the same time it is confessed, that\r\nin the case of a bad subsoil, trench-ploughing may do much harm.\r\nEvery practical man in fact knows that bringing up the subsoil in\r\nany quantity, he would in some districts render his fields in a great\r\nmeasure unproductive for years to come. On the other hand, we believe\r\nthat the use of the subsoil-plough can never do harm upon drained\r\nland. We speak, of course, of soils upon which it is already\r\nconceded that either the one method or the other ought to be adopted.\r\nThe utmost evil that can follow in any such case from the use of the\r\nsubsoil-plough, is that the expense will be thrown away--the land\r\ncannot be rendered more unfruitful by it. Subsoiling, therefore, is\r\nthe _safer_ practice.\r\n\r\nBut in reality, there ought, as we have already stated, to be no\r\nopposition between the two methods. Each has its own special uses\r\nfor which it can be best employed, and the skill of the farmer must\r\nbe exercised in determining whether the circumstances in which he is\r\nplaced are such as to call specially for the one or for the other\r\ninstrument. If the subsoil be a rich black mould, or a continuation\r\nof the same alluvial or other fertile soil which forms the surface--it\r\nmay be turned up at once by the trench-plough without hesitation. Or,\r\nif the subsoil be more or less full of lime, which has sunk from above,\r\ntrenching may with equal safety be adopted. But, if the subsoil be\r\nmore or less ferruginous--if it be of that yellow unproductive clay\r\nwhich in some cases extends over nearly whole counties--or of that\r\nhard, blue, stony till which requires the aid of the mattock to\r\nwork out of the drains--or if it consist of a hard and stony,\r\nmore or less impervious bed--in all these cases the use of the\r\nsubsoil-plough is clearly indicated. In short, the young farmer can\r\nscarcely have a safer rule than this--to subsoil his land first,\r\n_whenever there is a doubt of the soundness of the subsoil_, or a\r\nfear that by bringing it to the surface, the fertility of the upper\r\nsoil will be diminished. It is no reply to this safer practice to\r\nsay that even Mr. Smith recommends turning up the subsoil afterwards,\r\nand that we have therefore a double expense to incur. For it is known,\r\nthat after a time any subsoil so treated may be turned up with safety,\r\nand consequently there is no risk of loss by delaying this deeper\r\nploughing for a few years; and in regard to the question of expense,\r\nit appears that the cost of both draining and subsoiling are\r\ngenerally repayed by the first two or three crops which succeed each\r\nimprovement. What more, then, can be required? The expense is\r\nrepaid--the land is, to a certain extent, permanently improved--no\r\nrisk of loss has been incurred, and there still remains to the\r\nimproving farmer--improving his own circumstances, as well as the\r\nquality of his land, by his prudent and skilful measures--there\r\nstill remains the deeper ploughing, by which he can gradually bring\r\nnew soil to the surface, as he sees it mellow, and become wholesome,\r\nunder the joint influences which the drain and the subsoil-plough\r\nhave brought to bear upon it.\r\n\r\nThere can, therefore, it is clear, be no universal rule for the use\r\nof the two valuable instruments in question, as each has its own\r\ndefined sphere of action. This, we think, is the common-sense view\r\nof the case. But if any one insists upon having a universal rule\r\nwhich shall save him from thinking or observing for himself in all\r\ncases, then we should say--_in all cases subsoil, because it is the\r\nsafer_.\r\n\r\nWith this subject the first volume of _The Book of the Farm_ is\r\nbrought to a close; but winter still continues, and in other\r\nwinter-work of scarcely less importance the young farmer has still\r\nto be instructed. We have hitherto said nothing of the more expensive\r\nand beautiful embellishments of the book, because the most\r\ninteresting of them are portraits of celebrated short-horns, working\r\nhorses, sheep, and pigs--a subject of which the author begins to\r\ntreat only at the commencement of the second volume. The feeding of\r\nstock is one of those parts of the winter's labours, in improving\r\nhusbandry, upon which not only the immediate profit of the farmer,\r\nbut the ultimate fertility of his land, in a great measure depends.\r\nThe choice of his stock, and the best mode of treating and tending\r\nthem, therefore, are subjects of the greatest consequence to the\r\nyoung farmer. In the choice of his stock he will be aided at once by\r\nthe clear descriptions, and by the portraits so beautifully executed\r\nby Landseer and Sheriff, by which the letterpress is accompanied. In\r\nthe subsequent treatment of them, and in the mode by which they may\r\nbe most profitably, most quickly, or most economically fed _in the\r\nwinter season_, he will be fully instructed in the succeeding\r\nchapters of the book.\r\n\r\nTurnips and other roots are the principal food of cattle in the\r\nwinter: a preliminary chapter, therefore, is devoted to the\r\n\"drawing and storing of turnips and other roots.\" Had we our article\r\nto begin again, we could devote several pages, agreeably to ourselves,\r\nand not without interest, we believe, or without instruction, to our\r\nreader, in discussing a few of those points connected with the\r\nfeeding of cattle, upon which, though the means of information are\r\nwithin their reach, practical men have hitherto permitted themselves\r\nto remain wholly ignorant. Of these points Mr. Stephens adverts to\r\nseveral, and suggests the advantage of additional experiments; but\r\nthe whole subject requires revision, and, under the guidance of\r\npersons able to direct, who are acquainted with all that is yet known,\r\nor has as yet been done either in our own or in foreign countries,\r\nexperiments will hereafter, no doubt, be made, by which many new\r\ntruths, both theoretically and practically valuable, are sure to be\r\nelucidated.\r\n\r\nWe may advert, as an illustration, to the feeding properties of the\r\nturnip. It is usual to reckon the value of a crop of turnips by the\r\nnumber of tons per acre which it is found to yield when so many\r\nsquare yards of the produce are weighed. But this may be very\r\nfallacious in many ways. If they are white turnips, for instance,\r\nnine tons of small will contain as much nourishment as ten tons of\r\nlarge--or twenty-seven tons an acre of small turnips will feed as\r\nmany sheep as thirty tons per acre of large turnips. Or if the crop\r\nbe Swedes, the reverse will be the case, twenty-seven tons of large\r\nwill feed as much stock as thirty tons of small.--(Vol. ii., p. 20.)\r\nMr. Stephens points out other fallacies also, to which we cannot\r\nadvert. One, however, he has passed over, of equal, we believe of\r\ngreater, consequence than any other--we allude to the variable\r\nquantity of water which the turnip grown on different soils in\r\ndifferent seasons is found to contain.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, that in so far as the roots of the turnip, the carrot,\r\nand the potatoe, consist of water, they can serve the purposes of\r\ndrink only--they cannot feed the animals to which they are given. Now,\r\nthe quantity of water in the turnip is so great, that 100 _tons\r\nsometimes contain only nine tons of dry feeding matter_--more than\r\nnine-tenths of their weight consisting of water. But again, their\r\nconstitution is so variable, that 100 _tons sometimes contain more\r\nthan twenty tons of dry food_--or less than four-fifths of their\r\nweight of water. It is possible, therefore, that one acre of turnips,\r\non which only twenty tons are growing, may feed as many sheep as\r\nanother on which forty tons are produced. What, therefore, can be\r\nmore uncertain than the feeding value of an acre of turnips as\r\nestimated by the weight? How much in the dark are buyers and sellers\r\nof this root? What wonder is there, that different writers should\r\nestimate so very differently the weight of turnips which ought to be\r\ngiven for the purpose of sustaining the condition, or of increasing\r\nthe weight, of the several varieties of stock? Other roots exhibit\r\nsimilar differences; and even the potatoe, while it sometimes\r\ncontains thirty tons of food in every hundred of raw roots, at others,\r\ncontains no more than twenty--the same weight, namely, which exists\r\nat times in the turnip. [4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: For our authority on this subject, we refer to\r\nJohnston's _Suggestion for Experiments in Practical Agriculture_, No.\r\n111. pp. 62 and 64, of which we have been favoured with an early\r\ncopy by the author.]\r\n\r\nThis latter fact, shows the very slippery ground on which the\r\nassertion rests, that has lately astonished the weak minds of our\r\nSouthern cattle-feeding brethren, from the mouth of one of their\r\ntalented but hasty lecturers--that the potatoe contains two or three\r\ntimes the weight of nourishment which exists in the turnip. It is\r\ntrue that _some_ varieties of potatoes contain three times as much\r\nas _some_ varieties of turnip--but, on the other hand, some turnips\r\ncontain as much nourishment as an equal weight of potatoes. But no\r\nman can tell, by bare inspection, as yet, to which class of turnips,\r\nthe more or less watery, his own may belong--whether that which is\r\napparently the most prolific may not in reality be the least\r\nso--whether that mode of manuring his land which gives him the\r\ngreatest weight of raw roots may not give him the smallest weight of\r\nreal substantial food for his stock. What a wide field, therefore,\r\nfor experiment? To what useful results might they not be expected to\r\nlead? If any of our readers wish to undertake such experiments, or to\r\nlearn how they are to be performed, we refer them to the pamphlet\r\nmentioned in the note.\r\n\r\nIn connexion with the chapter \"on the feeding of sheep,\" we could\r\nhave wished to advert to the advantages of shelter, in producing the\r\nlargest weight of meat from a given weight of turnips, or other\r\nfood--as illustrated by the experiments of Mr. Childers, Lord Western,\r\nand others; but we must refer our readers to the passage itself,\r\n(vol. ii. p. 51,) as we must also to the no less important\r\ncomparative view of the advantages of feeding cattle in close byres\r\nand in open hammels, (vol. ii. p. 129,) and to the interesting\r\ndetails regarding the use of raw and steamed food, contained in the\r\nchapter upon the feeding of cattle, (vol. ii. p. 120 to 148.)\r\n\r\nBut our author is so cunning in the qualities of mutton--which, as\r\nwe have already seen, he can \"kill so gently,\" performing the\r\noperation without pain--that we think our readers will enjoy the\r\nfollowing passage:--\r\n\r\n\"The gigot is the handsomest and most valuable part of the carcass,\r\nand on that account fetches the highest price. It is either a\r\nroasting or a boiling piece. Of black-faced mutton it makes a fine\r\nroast, and the piece of fat in it called the _pope's eye_, is\r\nconsidered a delicate _morceau_ by epicures. A gigot of Leicester,\r\nCheviot, or Southdown mutton makes a beautiful 'boiled leg of mutton,'\r\nwhich is prized the more the fatter it is, as this part of the\r\ncarcass is never overloaded with fat. The loin is almost always\r\nroasted, the flap of the flank being skewered up, and it is a juicy\r\npiece. For a small family, the black-faced mutton is preferable; for\r\na large, the Southdown and Cheviot. Many consider this piece of\r\nLeicester mutton roasted as too rich, and when warm, this is\r\nprobably the case; but a cold roast loin is an excellent summer dish.\r\nThe back-ribs are divided into two, and used for very different\r\npurposes. The fore-part, the neck, is boiled and makes sweet\r\nbarley-broth, and the meat, when well boiled, or rather the whole\r\npottage simmered for a considerable time _beside_ the fire, eats\r\ntenderly. The back-ribs make an excellent roast; indeed, there is\r\nnot a sweeter or more varied one in the carcass, having both ribs\r\nand shoulder. The shoulder-blade eats best cold, and the ribs warm.\r\nThe ribs make excellent chops. The Leicester and Southdowns afford\r\nthe best mutton-chops. The breast is mostly a roasting-piece,\r\nconsisting of rib and shoulder, and is particularly good when cold.\r\nWhen the piece is large, as of Southdown or Cheviot, the gristly\r\npart of the ribs may be divided from the true ribs, and helped\r\nseparately. The breast is an excellent piece in black-faced mutton,\r\nand suitable to small families, the shoulder being eaten cold, while\r\nthe ribs and brisket are sweet and juicy when warm. This piece also\r\nboils well; or, when corned for eight days, and served with onion\r\nsauce, with mashed turnip in it, there are few more savoury dishes\r\nat a farmer's table. The shoulder is separated before being dressed,\r\nand makes an excellent roast for family use, and may be eaten warm or\r\ncold, or corned and dressed as the breast mentioned above. The\r\nshoulder is best from a large carcass of Southdown, Cheviot, or\r\nLeicester, the black-faced being too thin for the purpose; and it was\r\nprobably because English mutton is usually large that the practice\r\nof removing it originated. The neckpiece is partly laid bare by the\r\nremoval of the shoulder, the fore-part being fitted for boiling and\r\nmaking into broth, and the best end for roasting or broiling into\r\nchops. On this account this is a good family piece, and in such\r\nrequest among the tradesmen of London that they prefer it to any part\r\nof the hind-quarter.\"--(Vol. ii. p. 98.)\r\n\r\nNor is he less skilful in the humble food and cooking of the\r\nfarm-labourer; indeed, he seems never satisfied until he fairly\r\nexhausts all the useful matter contained in every subject upon which\r\nhe touches. He not only breeds, and feeds, and kills, and cooks, but\r\nhe does the latter with such relish, that we have several times\r\nfancied that we could actually see him eating his own mutton, beef,\r\nand pork. And, whether he luxuriates over a roast of the back-ribs\r\nof mutton, \"so sweet and so varied,\" or complains that \"the\r\nhotel-keepers have a trick of seasoning brown-soup, or rather\r\nbeef-tea, with a few joints of tail, and passing it off for genuine\r\nox-tail soup,\"--(vol. ii. p. 169,) or describes the \"_famous fat\r\nbrose_, for which Scotland has long been celebrated,\" as formed by\r\nskimming off the fat when boiling the hough, pouring it upon oatmeal,\r\nand seasoning with pepper and salt; or indulges in the humbler\r\nbrose of the ploughman in his bothy, he evidently enjoys every thing\r\nset before him so much, that we are sure he must lay on the fat\r\nkindly. We should not wonder if he is himself already _nicked_; and\r\nwe cannot more warmly testify our good wishes, than by expressing a\r\nhope, that, when he is fully _ripe_, the grim surgeon will operate\r\nupon him _without pain_, and kill him _gently_.\r\n\r\nOne of Mr. Stephens's humbler dishes is the following:--\r\n\r\n\"The only time Scotch farm-servants indulge in butcher-meat is when\r\na sheep _falls_, as it is termed; that is, when it is killed before\r\nbeing affected with an unwholesome disease, and the mutton is sold\r\nat a reduced price. Shred down the suet small, removing any flesh or\r\ncellular membrane adhering to it; then mix amongst it intimately 1/2\r\noz. of salt and a tea-spoonful of pepper to every pound of suet; put\r\nthe mixture into an earthen jar, and tie up tightly with bladder.\r\nOne table spoonful of seasoned suet will, at any time, make good\r\nbarley-broth or potato-soup for two persons. The lean of the mutton\r\nmay be shred down small, and seasoned in a similar manner, and used\r\nwhen required; or it may be corned with salt, and used as a joint.\"\r\n--Vol. ii. p. 105.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow much of the natural habits and manners of a country, and of the\r\ncircumstances and inner life of the various classes of its\r\ninhabitants, is to be learned from a study of their cookery!\r\n\r\nReader, what a mystery hangs over the _handling_ of a fat beast! A\r\nfeeder approaches a well filled short-horn--he touches it here--he\r\npinches it there--he declares it to have many good _points_ about it;\r\nbut pronounces the existence of defects, where the uninitiated see\r\nonly beauties. The points of a fat ox, how mysterious they are, how\r\ndifficult to make out! The five points of Arminianism, our old vicar\r\nused to say, were nothing to them. But here, too, Mr. Stephens is at\r\nhome. Listen to his simple explanation of the whole:\r\n\r\n\"The first point usually _handled_ is the end of the rump at the\r\ntail-head, although any fat here is very obvious, and sometimes\r\nattains to an enormous size, amounting even to deformity. The\r\nhook-bone gets a touch, and when well covered, is right.... To the\r\nhand, or rather to the points of the fingers of the right hand, when\r\nlaid upon the ribs, the flesh should feel soft and thick and the\r\nform be round when all is right, but if the ribs are flat the flesh\r\nwill feel hard and thin from want of fat. The skin, too, on a rounded\r\nrib, will feel soft and mobile, the hair deep and mossy, both\r\nindicative of a kindly disposition to lay on flesh. The hand then\r\ngrasps the flank, and finds it thick, when the existence of internal\r\ntallow is indicated.... The palm of the hand laid along the line of\r\nthe back will point out any objectionable hard piece on it, but if\r\nall is soft and pleasant, then the shoulder-top is good. A\r\nhollowness behind the shoulder is a very common occurrence; but when\r\nit is filled up with a layer of fat, the flesh of all the\r\nfore-quarter is thereby rendered very much more valuable. You would\r\nscarcely believe that such a difference could exist in the flesh\r\nbetween a lean and a fat shoulder. A high narrow shoulder is\r\nfrequently attended with a ridged back-bone, and lowset narrow hooks,\r\na form which gets the appropriate name of _razor-back_, with which\r\nwill always be found a deficiency of flesh in all the upper part of\r\nthe animal, where the best flesh always is. If the shoulder-point is\r\ncovered, and feels soft like the point of the hook-bone, it is good,\r\nand indicates a well filled neck-vein, which runs from that point to\r\nthe side of the head. The shoulder-point, however, is often bare and\r\nprominent. When the neck-vein is so firmly filled up as not to\r\npermit the points of the fingers inside of the shoulder-point, this\r\nindicates a well tallowed animal; as also does the filling up\r\nbetween the brisket and inside of the fore legs, as well as a full,\r\nprojecting, well covered brisket in front. When the flesh comes down\r\nheavy upon the thighs, making a sort of double thigh, it is called\r\n_lyary_, and indicates a tendency of the flesh to grow on the\r\nlower instead of the upper part of the body. These are all the\r\n_points_ that require _touching when the hand is used_; and in a\r\nhigh-conditioned ox, they may be gone over very rapidly.\"--Vol. ii. p.\r\n165.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe treatment of horses follows that of cattle, and this chapter is\r\nfitted to be of extensive use among our practical farmers. There are\r\nfew subjects to which the attention of our small farmers requires\r\nmore to be drawn than to the treatment of their horses--few in which\r\nwant of skill causes a more general and _constant_ waste. The\r\neconomy of _prepared_ food is ably treated of, and we select the\r\nfollowing passage as containing at once sound theoretical and\r\nimportant practical truths:\r\n\r\n\"It appears at first sight somewhat surprising that the idea of\r\npreparing food for farm-horses should only have been recently acted\r\non; but I have no doubt that the practice of the turf and of the road,\r\nof maintaining horses on large quantities of oats and dry ryegrass\r\nhay, has had a powerful influence in retaining it on farms. But now\r\nthat a more natural treatment has been adopted by the owners of\r\nhorses on fast work, farmers, having now the example of post-horses\r\nstanding their work well on prepared food, should easily be\r\npersuaded that, on slow work, the same sort of food should have even\r\na more salutary effect on their horses. How prevalent was the notion,\r\nat one time, that horses could not be expected to do work at all,\r\nunless there was _hard meat_ in them! 'This is a very silly and\r\nerroneous idea, if we inquire into it,' as Professor Dick truly\r\nobserves, 'for whatever may be the consistency of the food when\r\ntaken into the stomach, it must, before the body can possibly derive\r\nany substantial support or benefit from it, be converted into\r\n_chyme_--a pultacious mass; and this, as it passes onward from the\r\nstomach into the intestinal canal, is rendered still more fluid by\r\nthe admixture of the secretions from the stomach, the liver, and the\r\npancreas, when it becomes of a milky appearance, and is called\r\n_chyle_. It is then taken into the system by the lacteals, and in\r\nthis _fluid_, this _soft_ state--_and in this state only_--mixes\r\nwith the blood, and passes through the circulating vessels for the\r\nnourishment of the system.' Actuated by these rational principles,\r\nMr. John Croall, a large coach-proprietor in Edinburgh, now supports\r\nhis coach horses on 8 lb. of chopped hay and 16 lb. of bruised oats;\r\nso does Mr. Isaac Scott, a postmaster, who gives 10 lb. or 12 lb. of\r\nchopped hay and 16 lb. of bruised oats, to large horses: and to\r\ncarry the principle still further into practice, Captain Cheyne\r\nfound his post-horses work well on the following mixture, the\r\nproportions of which are given for each horse every day; and this\r\nconstitutes the second of the formulæ alluded to above.\"\r\n\r\n  In the day,\r\n  8 lb. of bruised oats.\r\n  3 lb. of bruised beans.\r\n  4 lb. of chopped straw.\r\n  ------\r\n  15 lb.\r\n\r\n  At night\r\n    22 lb. of steamed potatoes.\r\n  1-1/2 lb. of fine barley dust.\r\n     2 lb. of chopped straw.\r\n     2 oz. of salt.\r\n  ----------\r\n  25-1/2 lb.\r\n\r\n\"Estimating the barley-dust at 10d. per stone; chopped straw, 6d.\r\nper stone, potatoes, steamed, at 7s. 6d. per cwt.; and the oats and\r\nbeans at ordinary prices, the cost of supper was 6d., and for daily\r\nfood, 1s. with cooking, in all 1s. 6d. a horse each day.\"--Vol. ii. p.\r\n194.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader will also peruse with interest the following paragraph,\r\nillustrative at once of the habits of the horse, and of our author's\r\nfamiliarity with the race:--\r\n\r\n\"The horse is an intelligent animal, and seems to delight in the\r\nsociety of man. It is remarked by those who have much to do with\r\nblood-horses, that, when at liberty, and seeing two or more people\r\nstanding conversing together, they will approach, and seem, as it\r\nwere, to wish to listen to the conversation. The farm-horse will\r\nnot do this; but he is quite obedient to call, and distinguishes\r\nhis name readily from that of his companion, and will not stir\r\nwhen desired to stand until _his own name_ is pronounced. He\r\ndistinguishes the various sorts of work he is put to, and will apply\r\nhis strength and skill in the best way to effect his purpose,\r\nwhether in the thrashing-mill, the cart, or the plough. He soon\r\nacquires a perfect sense of his work. I have seen a horse walk very\r\nsteadily towards a feering pole, and halt when his head had reached\r\nit. He seems also to have a sense of time. I have heard another\r\nneigh almost daily about ten minutes before the time of loosening in\r\nthe evening, whether in summer or winter. He is capable of\r\ndistinguishing the tones of the voice, whether spoken in anger or\r\notherwise; and can even distinguish between musical notes. There was\r\na work-horse of my own, when even at his corn, would desist eating,\r\nand listen attentively, with pricked and moving ears and steady eyes,\r\nthe instant he heard the note of low G sounded, and would continue\r\nto listen as long as it was sustained; and another, that was\r\nsimilarly affected by a particular high note. The recognition of the\r\nsound of the bugle by a trooper, and the excitement occasioned in\r\nthe hunter when the pack give tongue, are familiar instances of the\r\nextraordinary effects of particular sounds on horses.\"--Vol. ii. p.\r\n216.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe recollect in our younger days, when we used to drive home from\r\nPenrith market, our friend would say, \"come, let us give the horse a\r\nsong--he will go home so briskly with us.\" And it really was so, or\r\nseemed so at least, be the principle what it may.\r\n\r\nPigs and poultry succeed to cattle and horses, and the author is\r\nequally at home in regard to the management of these as of the more\r\nvalued varieties of stock--as learned in their various breeds, and\r\nas skilful in the methods of fattening, killing, and cutting up. How\r\nmuch truth is contained in the following remarks, and how easily and\r\nusefully might the evil be amended:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Of all the animals reared on a farm, there are none so much\r\nneglected by the farmer, both in regard to the selection of their\r\nkind, and their qualifications to fatten, as all the sorts of\r\ndomesticated fowls found in the farm-yard. Indeed, the very\r\nsupposition that _he_ would devote any of _his_ time to the\r\nconsideration of poultry, is regarded as a positive affront on his\r\nmanhood. Women, in his estimation, may be fit enough for such a\r\ncharge, and doubtless they would do it well, provided they were not\r\nbegrudged every particle of food bestowed upon those useful creatures.\r\nThe consequence is what might be expected in the circumstances, that\r\ngo to most farm-steads, and the surprise will be to meet a single\r\nfowl of any description in _good_ condition, that is to say, in such\r\ncondition that it may be killed at the instant in a fit state for\r\nthe table, which it might be if it had been treated as a fattening\r\nanimal from its birth.\"--Vol. ii. p. 246.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe methods of fattening them are afterwards described; and for a\r\nmode _of securing a new-laid egg to breakfast every winter morning_,\r\na luxury which our author \"enjoyed for as many years as he lived in\r\nthe country,\" we refer the reader to page 256 of the second volume.\r\n\r\nBesides the feeding of stock, one other in-door labour demands the\r\nattention of the farmer, when the severity of winter weather has put\r\na stop to the ploughing and the draining of his land. His grain\r\ncrops are to be thrashed out, and sent to the market or the mill. In\r\nthis part of his work Mr. Stephens has again availed himself of the\r\nvaluable assistance of Mr. Slight, who, in upwards of 100 pages of\r\nclosely printed matter, has figured and described nearly all the\r\nmore useful instruments employed in the preparation of the food of\r\ncattle, and in separating the grain of the corn crops. The thrashing\r\nmachine, so valuable an addition to the working establishment of a\r\nmodern farm-steading, is minutely explained--the varieties in its\r\nconstruction illustrated by wood-cuts--and the respective merits of\r\nthe different forms of the machine examined and discussed. With the\r\nfollowing, among his other conclusions, we cordially concur.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot view these two machines without feeling impressed with a\r\nconviction that both countries would soon feel the advantage of an\r\namalgamation between the two forms of the machine. The drum of the\r\nScotch thrashing-machine would most certainly be improved by a\r\ntransfusion from the principles of the English machine; and the\r\nlatter might be equally improved by the adoption of the\r\nmanufacturing-like arrangements and general economy of the Scotch\r\nsystem of thrashing. That such interchange will ere long take place,\r\nI am thoroughly convinced; and as I am alike satisfied that the\r\nadvantages would be mutual, it is to be hoped that these views will\r\nnot stand alone. It has not been lost sight of, that each machine\r\nmay be said to be suited to the system to which it belongs, and that\r\nhere, where the corn is cut by the sickle, the machine is adapted to\r\nthat; while the same may be said of the other, where cutting by the\r\nscythe is so much practised. Notwithstanding all this, there appears\r\nto be good properties in both that either seems to stand in need of.\"\r\n--Vol. ii. p. 329.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther scientific, especially chemical information, connected with\r\nthe different varieties of grain, and the kind and quantity of food\r\nthey respectively yield, is incorporated in the chapters upon\r\n\"wheat, flour, and oat and bean meal,\" to which we can only advert,\r\nas further illustrations of the intimate manner in which science and\r\nskilful or enlightened practice are invariably, necessarily, and\r\nevery where interwoven.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now the dreary months of winter are ended--and the labours of\r\nthe farmer take a new direction.\r\n\r\n  \"Salvitur acris hiems gratâ vice veris et Favoni,\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"Ac neque jam stabulis gaudet pecus, aut arator igni.\"\r\n\r\nBut we cannot follow Mr. Stephens through the cheerful labours of the\r\ncoming year. Our task is so far ended, and from the way in which the\r\nwhole of the long weeks of winter are described, the reader must\r\njudge of Mr. Stephens's ability to lead him safely and surely\r\nthrough the rest of the year.\r\n\r\nA closing observation or two, however, we beg to offer. We look upon\r\na good book on agriculture as something more than a lucky speculation\r\nfor the publisher, or a profitable occupation of his time for the\r\nauthor. _It is a gain to the community at large,--a new instrument\r\nof national wealth_. The first honour or praise in reference to\r\nevery such instrument, is, no doubt, due to the maker or\r\ninventor--but he who brings is into general use, merits also no\r\nlittle approbation. Such is our case with respect to the book before\r\nus. We shall be glad to learn that our analysis of it contributes to\r\na wider circulation among the practical farmers of the empire, of\r\nthe manifold information which the book contains, not so much for\r\nthe sake of the author, as with a view to the common good of the\r\ncountry at large. It is to the more general diffusion of sound\r\nagricultural literature among our farmers, that we look for that more\r\nrapid development of the resources of our varied soils which the\r\ntimes so imperatively demand. To gain this end no legitimate means\r\nought to be passed by, and we have detained our readers so long upon\r\nthe book before us, in the hope that they may be induced to lend us\r\n_their_ aid also in attaining so desirable an object.\r\n\r\nWe do not consider _The Book of the Farm_ a perfect work: the author\r\nindulges now and then in loose and careless writing; and this\r\nincorrectness has more frequently struck us in the later portions of\r\nthe work, no doubt from the greater haste of composition. He sets\r\nout by slighting the aids of science to agriculture; and yet, in an\r\nearly part of his book, tells the young farmer that he \"must become\r\nacquainted with the agency of _electricity_ before he can understand\r\nthe variations of the weather,\" and ends by making his book, as we\r\nhave said, a running commentary upon the truth we have already\r\nseveral times repeated, that SKILFUL PRACTICE IS APPLIED SCIENCE.\r\n\r\nThese, and no doubt other faults the book has--as what book is\r\nwithout them?--but as a practical manual for those who wish to be\r\ngood farmers, it is the best book we know. It contains more of the\r\npractical applications of modern science, and adverts to more of\r\nthose interesting questions from which past improvements have sprung,\r\nand from the discussion of which future ameliorations are likely to\r\nflow, than any other of the newer works which have come under our eye.\r\nWhere so many excellences exist, we are not ill-natured enough to\r\nmagnify a few defects.\r\n\r\nThe excellence of Scottish agriculture may be said by some to give\r\nrise to the excellent agricultural books which Scotland, time after\r\ntime, has produced. But it may with equal truth be said, that the\r\nexistence of good books, and their diffusion among a reading\r\npopulation, are the sources of the agricultural distinction possessed\r\nby the northern parts of the island. It is beyond our power, as\r\nindividuals, to convert the entire agricultural population of our\r\nislands into a reading body, but we can avail ourselves of the\r\ntendency wherever it exists; and by writing, or diffusing, or aiding\r\nto diffuse, good books, we can supply ready instruction to such as\r\n_now_ wish for it, and can put it in the way of those in whom\r\nother men, by other means, are labouring to awaken the dormant\r\ndesire for knowledge. Reader, do _you_ wish to improve agriculture?\r\n--then buy you a good book, and place it in the hands of your tenant\r\nor your neighbouring farmer; if he be a reading man, he will thank\r\nyou, and his children may live to bless you; if he be not a reader,\r\nyou may have the gratification of wakening a dormant spirit; and\r\nthough you may appear to be casting your bread upon the waters, yet\r\nyou shall find it again after many days.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOEMS AND BALLADS OF SCHILLER.\r\n\r\nNo. VII.\r\n\r\n(The two following poems, \"The Ideal,\" and, \"The Ideal and Life,\"\r\nare essentially distinct in their mode of treatment. The first is\r\nsimple and tender, and expresses feelings in which all can sympathize.\r\nAs a recent and able critic, in the Foreign Quarterly Review, has\r\nobserved, this poem, \"still little known, contains a regret for the\r\nperiod of youthful faith,\" and may take its place among the most\r\ncharming and pathetic of all those numberless effusions of genius in\r\nwhich individual feeling is but the echo of the universal heart. But\r\nthe poem on \"The Ideal and Life\" is highly mystical and obscure;--\r\n\"it is a specimen,\" says the critic we have just quoted, \"of those\r\npoems which were the immediate results of Schiller's metaphysical\r\nstudies. Here the subject is purely supersensual, and does not\r\ndescend to the earth at all. The very tendency of the poem is to\r\nrecommend a life not in the actual world, but in the world of\r\nappearances [5]--that is, in the aesthetical world.\"\r\n\r\nIt requires considerable concentration of mind to follow its\r\nmeaning through the cloud of its dark and gigantic images. Schiller\r\ndesired his friend Humboldt to read it in perfect stillness, 'and\r\nput away from him all that was profane.' Humboldt, of course,\r\nadmired it prodigiously; and it is unquestionably full of thought\r\nexpressed with the power of the highest genius. But, on the other\r\nhand, its philosophy, even for a Poet or Idealist, is more than\r\ndisputable, and it incurs the very worst fault which a Poet can\r\ncommit, viz. obscurity of idea as well as expression. When the Poet\r\nsets himself up for the teacher, he must not forget that the\r\nteacher's duty is to be clear; and the higher the mystery he would\r\nexpound, the more pains he should bestow on the simplicity of the\r\nelucidation. For the true Poet does not address philosophical\r\ncoteries, but an eternal and universal public. Happily this fault is\r\nrare in Schiller, and more happily still, his great mind did not\r\nlong remain a groper amidst the 'Realm of Shadow.' The true Ideal is\r\nquite as liable to be lost amidst the maze of metaphysics, as in the\r\nactual thoroughfares of work-day life. A plunge into Kant may do\r\nmore harm to a Poet than a walk through Fleet Street. Goethe, than\r\nwhom no man had ever more studied the elements of the diviner art,\r\nwas right as an artist in his dislike to the over-cultivation of the\r\naesthetical. The domain of the Ideal is the heart, and through the\r\nheart it operates on the soul. It grows feebler and dimmer in\r\nproportion as it seeks to rise above human emotion.... Longinus does\r\nnot err, when he asserts that Passion (often erroneously translated\r\nPathos) is the best part of the Sublime.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Rather, according to Aesthetical Philosophy, is the\r\n_actual_ world to be called the _world of appearances_, and the\r\nIdeal the world of substance.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE IDEAL.\r\n\r\n  Then wilt thou, with thy fancies holy--\r\n    Wilt thou, faithless, fly from me?\r\n  With thy joy, thy melancholy,\r\n    Wilt thou thus relentless flee?\r\n  O Golden Time, O Human May,\r\n    Can nothing, Fleet One, thee restrain?\r\n  Must thy sweet river glide away\r\n    Into the eternal Ocean-Main?\r\n\r\n  The suns serene are lost and vanish'd\r\n    That wont the path of youth to gild,\r\n  And all the fair Ideals banish'd\r\n    From that wild heart they whilome fill'd.\r\n  Gone the divine and sweet believing\r\n    In dreams which Heaven itself unfurl'd!\r\n  What godlike shapes have years bereaving\r\n    Swept from this real work-day world!\r\n\r\n  As once, with tearful passion fired,\r\n    The Cyprian Sculptor clasp'd the stone,\r\n  Till the cold cheeks, delight-inspired,\r\n    Blush'd--to sweet life the marble grown;\r\n  So Youth's desire for Nature!--round\r\n    The Statue, so my arms I wreathed,\r\n  Till warmth and life in mine it found\r\n    And breath that poets breathe--it breathed.\r\n\r\n  With my own burning thoughts it burn'd;--\r\n    Its silence stirr'd to speech divine;--\r\n  Its lips my glowing kiss return'd;--\r\n    Its heart in beating answer'd mine!\r\n  How fair was then the flower--the tree!--\r\n    How silver-sweet the fountain's fall!\r\n  The soulless had a soul to me!\r\n    My life its own life lent to all!\r\n\r\n  The Universe of Things seem'd swelling\r\n    The panting heart to burst its bound,\r\n  And wandering Fancy found a dwelling\r\n    In every shape--thought--deed, and sound.\r\n  Germ'd in the mystic buds, reposing,\r\n    A whole creation slumber'd mute,\r\n  Alas, when from the buds unclosing,\r\n    How scant and blighted sprung the fruit!\r\n\r\n  How happy in his dreaming error,\r\n    His own gay valour for his wing,\r\n  Of not one care as yet in terror,\r\n    Did Youth upon his journey spring;\r\n  Till floods of balm, through air's dominion,\r\n    Bore upward to the faintest star--\r\n  For never aught to that bright pinion\r\n    Could dwell too high, or spread too far.\r\n\r\n  Though laden with delight, how lightly\r\n    The wanderer heavenward still could soar,\r\n  And aye the ways of life how brightly\r\n    The airy Pageant danced before!--\r\n  Love, showering gifts (life's sweetest) down,\r\n    Fortune, with golden garlands gay,\r\n  And Fame, with starbeams for a crown,\r\n    And Truth, whose dwelling is the Day.\r\n\r\n  Ah! midway soon, lost evermore,\r\n    Afar the blithe companions stray;\r\n  In vain their faithless steps explore,\r\n    As, one by one, they glide away.\r\n  Fleet Fortune was the first escaper--\r\n    The thirst for wisdom linger'd yet;\r\n  But doubts with many a gloomy vapour\r\n    The sun-shape of the Truth beset!\r\n\r\n  The holy crown which Fame was wreathing,\r\n    Behold! the mean man's temples wore!\r\n  And but for one short spring-day breathing,\r\n    Bloom'd Love--the Beautiful--no more!\r\n  And ever stiller yet, and ever\r\n    The barren path more lonely lay,\r\n  Till waning Hope could scarcely quiver\r\n    Along the darkly widening way.\r\n\r\n  Who, loving, linger'd yet to guide me,\r\n    When all her boon companions fled?\r\n  Who stands consoling still beside me,\r\n    And follows to the House of Dread?\r\n  _Thine_, Friendship! _thine_, the hand so tender--\r\n    Thine the balm dropping on the wound--\r\n  Thy task--the load more light to render,\r\n    O, earliest sought and soonest found!\r\n\r\n  And _thou_, so pleased with her uniting\r\n    To charm the soul-storm into peace,\r\n  Sweet _Toil_![6] in toil itself delighting,\r\n    That more it labor'd, less could cease:\r\n  Though but by grains, thou aid'st the pile\r\n    The vast Eternity uprears--\r\n  At least thou strik'st from Time, the while,\r\n    Life's debt--the minutes, days, and years![7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: That is to say--the Poet's occupation--The Ideal.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Though the Ideal images of youth forsake us--the Ideal\r\nstill remains to the Poet.--Nay, it is his task and his companion;\r\nunlike the worldly fantasies of fortune--fame, and love--the\r\nfantasies the Ideal creates are imperishable.

Oh rejoice\r\n  That heaven the gifts of Song showers down below--\r\n  That what the muse hath taught him, the sweet voice\r\n  Of the glad minstrel teaches thee!--the soul\r\n  Which the god breathes in him, he can bestow\r\n  In turn upon the listener--if his breast\r\n  The blessing feel, thy heart is in that blessing blest.\r\n\r\n  The busy mart let Justice still control,\r\n  Weighing the guerdon to the toil!--What then?\r\n  A god alone claims joy--all joy is his,\r\n  Flushing with unsought light the cheeks of men.\r\n  Where is no miracle, why there no bliss!\r\n  Grow, change, and ripen all that mortal be,\r\n  Shapen'd from form to form, by toiling time;\r\n  The Blissful and the Beautiful are born\r\n  Full grown, and ripen'd from Eternity--\r\n  No gradual changes to their glorious prime,\r\n  No childhood dwarfs them, and no age has worn.--\r\n  Like Heaven's, each earthly Venus on the sight\r\n  Comes, a dark birth, from out an endless sea;\r\n  Like the first Pallas, in maturest might,\r\n  Arm'd, from the Thunderer's brow, leaps forth each Thought of Light.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have now, with few exceptions, translated all the principal poems\r\ncomprised in the third, or maturest period of Schiller's life. We\r\nhere pass back to the poems of his youth. The contrast in tone,\r\nthought, and spirit, between the compositions of the first and the\r\nthird period, in the great poet's intellectual career, is\r\nsufficiently striking. In the former, there is little of that\r\nmajestic repose of strength so visible in the latter; but there is\r\ninfinitely more fire and action--more of that lavish and exuberant\r\nenergy which characterized the earlier tales of Lord Byron, and\r\nredeemed, in that wonderful master of animated and nervous style, a\r\ncertain poverty of conception by a vigour and _gusto_ of execution,\r\nwhich no English poet, perhaps, has ever surpassed. In his poems\r\nlies the life, and beats the heart, of Schiller. They conduct us\r\nthrough the various stages of his spiritual education, and indicate\r\neach step in the progress. In this division, _effort_ is no less\r\ndiscernible than power--both in language and thought there is a\r\nstruggle at something not yet achieved, and not, perhaps, even yet\r\ndefinite and distinct to the poet himself. Here may be traced,\r\nthough softened by the charm of genius, (which softens all things,)\r\nthe splendid errors that belong to a passionate youth, and that give\r\nsuch distorted grandeur to the giant melodrama of \"The Robbers.\" But\r\nhere are to be traced also, and in far clearer characters, the man's\r\nstrong heart, essentially human in its sympathies--the thoughtful\r\nand earnest intellect, not yet equally developed with the fancy, but\r\ngiving ample promise of all it was destined to receive. In these\r\nearlier poems, extravagance is sufficiently noticeable--yet never\r\nthe sickly eccentricities of diseased weakness, but the exuberant\r\noverflowings of a young Titan's strength. There is a distinction,\r\nwhich our critics do not always notice, between the _extravagance_\r\nof a great genius, and the _affectation_ of a pretty poet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST PERIOD\r\n\r\n\r\nHECTOR AND ANCROMACHE. [11]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: This and the following poem are, with some alterations,\r\nintroduced in the play of \"The Robbers.\"]\r\n\r\n  ANDROMACHE.\r\n\r\n  Will Hector leave me for the fatal plain,\r\n  Where, fierce with vengeance for Patroclus slain,\r\n              Stalks Peleus' ruthless son?\r\n  Who, when thou glidest amid the dark abodes,\r\n  To hurl the spear and to revere the Gods,\r\n              Shall teach shine Orphan One?\r\n\r\n  HECTOR.\r\n\r\n  Woman and wife belovèd--cease thy tears;\r\n  My soul is nerved--the war-clang in my ears!\r\n              Be mine in life to stand\r\n  Troy's bulwark, fighting for our hearths--to go,\r\n  In death, exulting to the streams below,\r\n              Slain for my fatherland!\r\n\r\n  ANDROMACHE.\r\n\r\n  No more I hear thy martial footsteps fall--\r\n  Thine arms shall hang, dull trophies, on the wall--\r\n              Fallen the stem of Troy!\r\n  Thou go'st where slow Cocytus wanders--where\r\n  Love sinks in Lethe, and the sunless air\r\n              Is dark to light and joy!\r\n\r\n  HECTOR.\r\n\r\n  Sinew and thought--yea, all I feel and think\r\n  May in the silent sloth of Lethe sink,\r\n              But my love not!\r\n  Hark, the wild swarm is at the walls!--I hear!\r\n  Gird on my sword--beloved one, dry the tear--\r\n              Lethe for love is not!\r\n\r\n\r\nAMALIA.\r\n\r\n  Fair as an angel from his blessed hall--\r\n    Of every fairest youth the fairest he!\r\n  Heaven-mild his look, as maybeams when they fall,\r\n    Or shine reflected from a clear blue sea!\r\n  His kisses--feelings rife with paradise!\r\n    Ev'n as two flames, one on the other driven--\r\n  Ev'n as two harp-tones their melodious sighs\r\n    Blend in some music that seems born of heaven;\r\n  So rush'd, mix'd, melted--life with life united!\r\n    Lips, cheeks burn'd, trembled--soul to soul was won!\r\n  And earth and heaven seem'd chaos, as delighted\r\n    Earth--heaven were blent round the belovèd one!\r\n  Now, he is gone! vainly and wearily\r\n    Groans the full heart, the yearning sorrow flows--\r\n  Gone! and all zest of life, in one long sigh,\r\n    Goes with him where he goes.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LAURA.\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERY OF REMINISCENCE. [12]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: This most exquisite love-poem is founded on the Platonic\r\nnotion, that souls were united in a pre-existent state, that love is\r\nthe yearning of the spirit to reunite with the spirit with which it\r\nformerly made one--and which it discovers on earth. The idea has\r\noften been made subservient to poetry, but never with so earnest and\r\nelaborate a beauty.]\r\n\r\n  Who, and what gave to me the wish to woo thee--\r\n  Still, lip to lip, to cling for aye unto thee?\r\n  Who made thy glances to my soul the link--\r\n  Who bade me burn thy very breath to drink--\r\n            My life in thine to sink?\r\n  As from the conquerors unresisted glaive,\r\n  Flies, without strife subdued, the ready slave--\r\n  So, when to life's unguarded fort, I see\r\n  Thy gaze draw near and near triumphantly--\r\n            Yields not my soul to thee?\r\n  Why from its lord doth thus my soul depart?--\r\n  Is it because its native home thou art?\r\n  Or were they brothers in the days of yore,\r\n  Twin-bound both souls, and in the links they bore\r\n            Sigh to be bound once more?\r\n  Were once our beings blent and intertwining,\r\n  And therefore still my heart for thine is pining?\r\n  Knew we the light of some extinguished sun--\r\n  The joys remote of some bright realm undone,\r\n            Where once our souls were ONE?\r\n  Yes, it _is_ so!--And thou wert bound to me\r\n  In the long-vanish'd Eld eternally!\r\n  In the dark troubled tablets which enroll\r\n  The Past--my Muse beheld this blessed scroll--\r\n            \"One with thy love my soul!\"\r\n  Oh yes, I learn'd in awe, when gazing there,\r\n  How once one bright inseparate life we were,\r\n\r\n  How once, one glorious essence as a God,\r\n  Unmeasured space our chainless footsteps trode--\r\n            All Nature our abode!\r\n  Round us, in waters of delight, for ever\r\n  Voluptuous flow'd the heavenly Nectar river;\r\n  We were the master of the seal of things,\r\n  And where the sunshine bathed Truth's mountain-springs\r\n            Quiver'd our glancing wings.\r\n  Weep for the godlike life we lost afar--\r\n  Weep!--thou and I its scatter'd fragments are;\r\n  And still the unconquer'd yearning we retain--\r\n  Sigh to restore the rapture and the reign,\r\n            And grow divine again.\r\n  And therefore came to me the wish to woo thee--\r\n  Still, lip to lip, to cling for aye unto thee;\r\n  _This_ made thy glances to my soul the link--\r\n  _This_ made me burn thy very breath to drink--\r\n            My life in thine to sink:\r\n  And therefore, as before the conqueror's glaive,\r\n  Flies, without strife subdued, the ready slave,\r\n  So, when to life's unguarded fort, I see\r\n  Thy gaze draw near and near triumphantly--\r\n            Yieldeth my soul to thee!\r\n  Therefore my soul doth from its lord depart,\r\n  _Because_, beloved, its native home thou art;\r\n  Because the twins recall the links they bore,\r\n  And soul with soul, in the sweet kiss of yore,\r\n            Meets and unites once more.\r\n  Thou too--Ah, there thy gaze upon me dwells,\r\n  And thy young blush the tender answer tells;\r\n  Yes! with the dear relation still we thrill,\r\n  Both lives--tho' exiles from the homeward hill--\r\n            _One_ life--all glowing still!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LAURA.\r\n\r\n(Rapture.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  Laura--above this world methinks I fly,\r\n  And feel the glow of some May-lighted sky,\r\n      When thy looks beam on mine!\r\n  And my soul drinks a more ethereal air,\r\n  When mine own shape I see reflected there,\r\n      In those blue eyes of thine!\r\n  A lyre-sound from the Paradise afar,\r\n  A harp-note trembling from some gracious star,\r\n      Seems the wild ear to fill;\r\n  And my muse feels the Golden Shepherd-hours,\r\n  When from thy lips the silver music pours\r\n      Slow, as against its will.\r\n  I see the young Loves flutter on the wing--\r\n  Move the charm'd trees, as when the Thracian's string\r\n      Wild life to forests gave;\r\n  Swifter the globe's swift circle seems to fly,\r\n  When in the whirling dance thou glidest by,\r\n      Light as a happy wave.\r\n  Thy looks, when there love sheds the loving smile,\r\n  Could from the senseless marble life beguile--\r\n      Lend rocks a pulse divine;\r\n  Into a dream my very being dies,\r\n  I can but read--for ever read--thine eyes--\r\n      Laura, sweet Laura, mine![13]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: We confess we cannot admire the sagacity of those who\r\nhave contended that Schiller's passion for Laura was purely

 Now with majestic swell, and strong,\r\n  As thunder peals in organ-tones along;\r\n    And now with stormy gush,\r\n  As down the rock, in foam, the whirling torrents rush.\r\n        To a whisper now\r\n          Melts it amorously,\r\n        Like the breeze through the bough\r\n          Of the aspen tree;\r\n    Heavily now, and with a mournful breath,\r\n    Like midnight's wind along those wastes of death,\r\n  Where Awe the wail of ghosts lamenting hears,\r\n  And slow Cocytus trails the stream whose waves are tears.\r\n\r\n  Speak, maiden, speak!--Oh, art thou one of those\r\n  Spirits more lofty than our region knows?\r\n  Should we in _thine_ the mother-language seek\r\n    Souls in Elysium speak?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOWERS.\r\n\r\n  Children of Suns restored to youth,\r\n

1672! It was the age of romances in\r\ntwenty volumes, and flowing periwigs, and high-heeled shoes, and\r\nhoops, and elegance, and wit, and rouge, and literary suppers, and\r\ngallantry, and devotion. What names are those of La Calprenède, and\r\nD'Urfé, and De Scuderi, to be the idols and tutelary deities of a\r\ncirculating library!--and Sevigné, to conduct the fashionable\r\ncorrespondence of the _Morning Post_!--and Racine, to contribute to\r\nthe unacted drama!--and ladies skipping up the steepest parts of\r\nParnassus, with petticoats well tucked up, to show the beauty of\r\ntheir ankles, and their hands filled with artificial flowers--almost\r\nas good as natural--to show the simplicity of their tastes! I wish I\r\nhad lived in France in 1672; for in that year Madame Deshoulieres,\r\nwho had already been voted the tenth muse by all the freeholders of\r\nPieria, and whose pastorals were lisped by all the fashionable\r\nshepherdesses in Paris, left the flowery banks of the Seine to\r\nrejoin her husband. Monsieur Deshoulieres was in Guyenne; Madame\r\nDeshoulieres went into Dauphiné. Matrimony seems to be rather hurtful\r\nto geographical studies, but Madame Deshoulieres was a poetess; and\r\nin spite of the thirty-eight summers that shaded the lustre of her\r\ncheek, she was beautiful, and was still in the glow of youth by her\r\ngrace and her talent, and--her heart. Wherever she moved she left\r\ncrowds of Corydons and Alexises; but, luckily for M. Deshoulieres,\r\ntheir whole conversation was about sheep.\r\n\r\nThe two Mesdemoiselles Deshoulieres, Madeleine and Bribri, were\r\nbeautiful girls of seventeen or eighteen, brought up in all the\r\ninnocent pastoralism of their mother. They believed in all the\r\npoetical descriptions they read in her eclogues. They expected to\r\nsee shepherds playing on their pipes, and shepherdesses dancing, and\r\nnaiads reclining on the shady banks of clear-running rivers. They\r\nwere delighted to get out of the prosaic atmosphere of Paris, and\r\nall the three were overjoyed when they sprang from their carriage,\r\none evening in May, at the chateau of Madame d'Urtis on the banks of\r\nthe Lignon. Though there were occasional showers at that season, the\r\nmornings were splendid; and accordingly the travellers were up\r\nalmost by daylight, to tread the grass still trembling 'neath the\r\nsteps of Astrea--to see the fountain, that mirror where the\r\nshepherdesses wove wild-flowers into their hair--and to explore the\r\nwood, still vocal with the complaints of Celadon. In one of their\r\nfirst excursions, Madeleine Deshoulieres, impatient to see some of\r\nthe scenes so gracefully described by her mother, asked if they were\r\nreally not to encounter a single shepherd on the banks of the Lignon?\r\nMadame Deshoulieres perceived, at no great distance, a herdsman and\r\ncow-girl playing at chuckfarthing; and, after a pause, replied--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Behold upon the verdant grass so sweet,\r\n  The shepherdess is at her shepherd's feet!\r\n  Her arms are bare, her foot is small and white,\r\n  The very oxen wonder at the sight;\r\n  Her locks half bound, half floating in the air,\r\n  And gown as light as those that satyrs wear.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile these lines were given in Madame Deshoulieres' inimitable\r\nrecitative, the party had come close to the rustic pair. \"People may\r\nwell say,\" muttered Madeleine, \"that the pictures of Nature are\r\nalways best at a distance. Can it be possible that this is a\r\nshepherdess--a shepherdess of Lignon?\" The shepherdess was in\r\nreality a poor little peasant girl, unkempt, unshorn, with hands of\r\nprodigious size, a miraculous squint, and a mouth which probably had\r\na beginning, but of which it was impossible to say where it might\r\nend. The shepherd was worthy of his companion; and yet there was\r\nsomething in the extravagant stupidity of his fat and florid\r\ncountenance that was interesting to a Parisian eye. Madame\r\nDeshoulieres, who was too much occupied with the verses of the great\r\nD'Urfé to attend to what was before her, continued her description--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"The birds all round her praises ever sing,\r\n  And 'neath her steps the flowers incessant spring.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Your occupation here is delightful, isn't it?\" said Madeleine to the\r\npeasant girl.\r\n\r\n\"No, 'tain't, miss--that it ain't. I gets nothink for all I does,\r\nand when I goes hoam at night I gets a good licking to the bargain.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you?\" enquired Madeleine, turning to the herdsman, who was\r\nslinking off.\r\n\r\n\"I'm a little b-b-b-etter off nor hur,\" said the man, stuttering,\r\n\"for I gets board and lodging--dasht if I doesn't--but I gets bread\r\nlike a stone, and s-s-sleeps below a hedge--dasht if I doesn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where are your sheep, shepherd?\" said Bribri.\r\n\r\n\"Hain't a got none,\" stuttered the man again, \"dasht if I has.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed Madeleine in despair, \"am I not to see the lovely\r\nlambkins bleating and skipping in the meadows on the banks of the\r\nLignon, O Celadon?\"\r\n\r\nBut Madame Deshoulieres was too much of a poetess to hear or see what\r\nwas going on. She thought of nothing but the loves of Astrea, and\r\nheard nothing but the imaginary songs of contending Damons.\r\n\r\nOn their return to the chateau, Madeleine and Bribri complained that\r\nthey had seen neither flock nor shepherdess.\r\n\r\n\"And are you anxious to see them?\" enquired Madame D'Urtis, with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very,\" exclaimed Bribri; \"we expected to live like\r\nshepherdesses when we came here. I have brought every thing a rustic\r\nwants.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so have I,\" continued Madeleine; \"I have brought twenty yards\r\nof rose-coloured ribands, and twenty yards of blue, to ornament my\r\ncrook and the handsomest of my ewes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then,\" said the Duchess d'Urtis, good-naturedly, \"there are a\r\ndozen of sheep feeding at the end of the park. Take the key of the\r\ngate, and drive them into the meadows beyond.\"\r\n\r\nMadeleine and Bribri were wild with joy, while their mother was\r\nlabouring in search of a rhyme, and did not attend to the real\r\neclogue which was about to be commenced. They scarcely took time to\r\nbreakfast.--\"They dressed themselves coquettishly\"--so Madame\r\nDeshoulieres wrote to Mascaron--\"they cut with their own hands a\r\ncrook a-piece in the park--they beautified them with ribands.\r\nMadeleine was for the blue ribands, Bribri for the rose colour. Oh,\r\nthe gentle shepherdesses! they spent a whole hour in finding a name\r\nthey liked. At last, Madeleine fixed on Amaranthe, Bribri on Daphnè.\r\nI have just seen them gliding among the trees that overshadow the\r\nlovely stream.--Poor shepherdesses! be on your guard against the\r\nwolves.\"\r\n\r\nAt noon that very day Madeleine and Bribri, or rather Amaranthe and\r\nDaphnè, in grey silk petticoats and satin bodies, with their\r\nbeautiful hair in a state of most careful disorder, and with their\r\ncrooks in hand, conducted the twelve sheep out of the park into the\r\nmeadows. The flock, which seemed to be very hungry, were rather\r\ntroublesome and disobedient. The shepherdesses did all they could to\r\nkeep them in the proper path. It was a delicious mixture of bleatings,\r\nand laughter, and baaings, and pastoral songs. The happy girls\r\ninhaled the soul of nature, as their poetical mamma expressed it.\r\nThey ran--they threw themselves on the blooming grass--they looked\r\nat themselves in the limpid waters of the Lignon--they gathered\r\nlapfulls of primroses. The flock made the best use of their time;\r\nand every now and then a sheep of more observation than the rest,\r\nperceiving they were guarded by such extraordinary shepherdesses,\r\ntook half an hour's diversion among the fresh-springing corn.\r\n\r\n\"That's one of yours,\" said Amaranthe.\r\n\r\n\"No; 'tis yours,\" replied Daphnè; but, by way of having no\r\ndifficulties in future, they resolved to divide the flock, and\r\nornament one-half with blue collars, and the other with rose-colour.\r\nAnd they gave a name also to each of the members of their flock,\r\nsuch as Meliboeus, and Jeannot, and Robin, and Blanchette. Twelve\r\nmore poetical sheep were never fed on grass before. When the sun\r\nbegan to sink, the shepherdesses brought back their flocks. Madame\r\nDeshoulieres cried with joy. \"Oh, my dear girls!\" she said, kissing\r\ntheir fair foreheads; \"it is you that have composed an eclogue, and\r\nnot I.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is wanting to the picture,\" said the Duchess, seating\r\nherself under the willows of the watering-place, and admiring the\r\ngraceful girls.\r\n\r\n\"I think we want a dog,\" said Daphnè.\r\n\r\n\"No; we are rather in want of a wolf,\" whispered the beautiful\r\nAmaranthe--and blushed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nNot far from the Chateau d'Urtis, the old manor-house of Langevy\r\nraised its pointed turrets above the surrounding woods. There, in\r\ncomplete isolation from the world, lived Monsieur de Langevy, his\r\nold mother, and his young son. M. de Langevy had struggled against\r\nthe storms and misfortunes of human life; he now reposed in the\r\nbosom of solitude, with many a regret over his wife and his\r\nyouth--his valiant sword and his adventures. His son, Hector Henri de\r\nLangevy, had studied under the Jesuits at Lyons till he was eighteen.\r\nAccustomed to the indulgent tenderness of his grandmother, he had\r\nreturned, about two years before, determined to live in his quiet\r\nhome without troubling himself about the military glories that had\r\ninspired his father. M. de Langevy, though he disapproved of the\r\nyouth's choice, did not interfere with it, except that he insisted\r\non his sometimes following the chase, as the next best occupation to\r\nactual war. The chase had few charms for Hector. It perhaps might\r\nhave had more, if he had not been forced to arm himself with an\r\nenormous fowling-piece that had belonged to one of his ancestors,\r\nthe very sight of which alarmed him a mighty deal more than the game.\r\nHe was so prodigious a sportsman, that, after six months' practice,\r\nhe was startled as much as ever by the whirr of a partridge. But\r\ndon't imagine, on this account, that Hector's time was utterly wasted.\r\nHe mused and dreamed, and fancied it would be so pleasant to be in\r\nlove; for he was at that golden age--the only golden age the world\r\nhas ever seen--when the heart passes from vision to vision (as the\r\nbee from flower to flower)--and wanders, in its dreams of hope, from\r\nearth to heaven, from sunshine to shade--from warbling groves to\r\nsighing maidens. But alas! the heart of Hector searched in vain for\r\nsighing maidens in the woods of Langevy. In the chateau, there was\r\nno one but an old housekeeper, who had probably not sighed for thirty\r\nyears, and a chubby scullion-maid--all unworthy of a soul that\r\ndreamed romances on the banks of the Lignon. He counted greatly on a\r\ncousin from Paris, who had promised them a visit in the spring. In\r\nthe meantime, he paced up and down with a gun on his shoulder,\r\npretending to be a sportsman--happy in his hopes, happy in the clear\r\nsunshine, happy because he knew no better--as happens to a great\r\nmany other people in the gay days of their youth, in this most\r\nunjustly condemned and vilipended world. And now you will probably\r\nguess what occurred one day he was walking in his usual dreamy state\r\nof abstraction, and as nearly as possible tumbled head foremost into\r\nthe Lignon. By dint of marching straight on, without minding either\r\nhedge or ditch, he found himself, when he awakened from his reverie,\r\nwith his right foot raised, in the very act of stepping off the bank\r\ninto the water. He stood stock-still, in that somewhat unpicturesque\r\nattitude--his mouth wide open, his eyes strained, and his cheek\r\nglowing with all the colours of the rainbow. He had caught a glimpse\r\nof our two enchanting shepherdesses on the other side of the stream,\r\nwho were watching his movements by stealth. He blushed far redder\r\nthan he had ever done before, and hesitated whether he should\r\nretreat or advance. To retreat, he felt, would look rather awkward:\r\nat the same time, he thought it would be too great a price to pay\r\nfor his honour to jump into the river. And, besides, even if he got\r\nover to the other side, would he have courage to speak to them?\r\nAltogether, I think he acted more wisely, though less chivalrously,\r\nthan some might have done in his place. He laid down his gun, and\r\nseated himself on the bank, and looked at the sheep as they fed on\r\nthe opposite side. At twenty years of age, love travels at an amazing\r\npace; and Hector felt that he was already over head and ears with\r\none of the fair shepherdesses. He did not stop to examine which of\r\nthem it was; it was of no consequence--sufficient for him that he\r\nknew he was in love--gone--captivated. If he had been twenty years\r\nolder, he would perhaps have admired them both: it would have been\r\nless romantic, but decidedly more wise.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be denied that Amaranthe and Daphnè blushed a little,\r\ntoo, at this sort of half meeting with Hector. They hung down their\r\nheads in the most captivating manner, and continued silent for some\r\ntime. But at last Amaranthe, more lively than her sister,\r\nrecommenced her chatter. \"Look, Bribri,\" she said--\"Daphnè I mean--he\r\nis one of the silvan deities, or perhaps Narcissus looking at himself\r\nin the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather say, looking at you,\" replied Daphnè, with a blush.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis Pan hiding himself in the oziers till you are metamorphosed\r\ninto a flute, dear Daphnè.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so, fair sister,\" replied Daphnè; \"'tis Endymion in pursuit of\r\nthe shepherdess Amaranthe.\"\r\n\r\n\"At his present pace, the pursuit will last some time. If he weren't\r\nquite so rustic, he would be a captivating shepherd, with his long\r\nbrown ringlets. He has not moved for an hour. What if he has taken\r\nroot like a hamadryad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor fellow!\" said Daphnè, in the simplest tone in the world;\r\n\"he looks very dull all by himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"He must come over to us--that's very plain. We will give him a crook\r\nand a bouquet of flowers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, just the thing!\" exclaimed the innocent Daphnè. \"We need a\r\nshepherd: and yet, no, no\"--she added, for she was a little jealous\r\nof her sister--\"'tis a lucky thing there is river between us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope he will find a bridge _per passa lou riou d'amor_.\"\r\n\r\nNow, just at that moment Hector's mind was set on passing the river\r\nof Love. In casting his eyes all round in search of a passage, he\r\nperceived an old willow half thrown across the stream. With a little\r\ncourage and activity, it was a graceful and poetical bridge. Hector\r\nresolved to try it. He rose and went right onward towards the tree;\r\nbut, when he arrived, he couldn't help reflecting that, at that\r\nseason, the river was immensely deep. He disdained the danger--sprang\r\nlightly up the trunk, and flung himself along one of the branches,\r\ndropping, happily without any accident, on the meadow of the Chateau\r\nd'Urtis. Little more was left for him to do; and that little he did.\r\nHe went towards the fair shepherdesses. He tried to overcome his\r\ntimidity--he overwhelmed the first sheep of the flock with his\r\ninsidious caresses--and then, finding himself within a few feet of\r\nAmaranthe--he bowed, and smiled, and said, \"Mademoiselle.\"\r\n\r\nHe was suddenly interrupted by a clear and silvery voice.\r\n\r\n\"There are no Mesdemoiselles here--there are only two shepherdesses,\r\nAmaranthe and Daphnè.\"\r\n\r\nHector had prepared a complimentary speech for a young lady attending\r\na flock of sheep--but he hadn't a word to say to a shepherdess.\r\n\r\nHe bowed again, and there was a pause.\r\n\r\n\"Fair Amaranthe,\" he said--\"and fair Daphnè, will you permit a mortal\r\nto tread these flowery plains?\"\r\n\r\nAmaranthe received the speech with a smile, in which a little\r\nraillery was mingled. \"You speak like a true shepherd,\" she said.\r\n\r\nBut Daphnè was more good-natured, and more touched with the\r\npoliteness of the sportsman. She cast her eyes on the ground and\r\nblushed.\r\n\r\n\"Oh--if you wish to pass through these meadows,\" she said--\"we shall\r\nbe\"--\r\n\r\n\"We were going to do the honours of our reception room,\" continued\r\nAmaranthe, \"and offer you a seat on the grass.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis too much happiness to throw myself at your feet,\" replied\r\nHector, casting himself on one knee.\r\n\r\nBut he had not looked where he knelt, and he broke Daphnè's crook.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my poor crook!\" she said--and sighed.\r\n\r\n\"What have I done?\" cried Hector. \"I am distressed at my stupidity--I\r\nwill cut you another from the ash grove below. But you loved this\r\ncrook,\" he added--\"the gift, perhaps, of some shepherd--some shepherd?\r\n--no, some prince; for you yourselves are princesses--or fairies.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are nothing but simple shepherdesses,\" said Amaranthe.\r\n\r\n\"You are nothing but beautiful young ladies from the capital,\" said\r\nHector, \"on a visit at the Chateau d'Urtis. Heaven be praised--for in\r\nmy walks I shall at least catch glimpses of you at a distance, if I\r\ndare not come near. I shall see you glinting among the trees like\r\nenchantresses of old.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we are Parisians, as you have guessed--but retired for ever\r\nfrom the world and its deceitful joys.\"\r\n\r\nAmaranthe had uttered the last words in a declamatory tone; you\r\nmight have thought them a quotation from her mamma.\r\n\r\n\"You complain rather early, methinks,\" replied Hector, with a smile;\r\n\"have you indeed much fault to find with the world?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is our secret, fair sportsman,\" answered Amaranthe; \"but it\r\nseems you also live retired--an eremite forlorn.\"\r\n\r\n\"I? fair Amaranthe? I have done nothing but dream of the delights of\r\na shepherd's life--though I confess I had given up all hopes of\r\nseeing a good-looking shepherdess--but now I shall go back more\r\nhappily than ever to my day-dreams. Ah! why can't I help you to\r\nguard your flock?\"\r\n\r\nThe two young girls did not know what to say to this proposition.\r\nDaphnè at last replied--\r\n\r\n\"Our flock is very small--and quite ill enough attended to as it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"What joy for me to become Daphnis--to sing to you, and gather roses,\r\nand twine them in your hair!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us say no more,\" interrupted Amaranthe, a little disquieted at\r\nthe sudden ardour of Daphnis; \"the sun is going down: we must return\r\nto the park. Adieu,\" she added, rising to go away.\r\n\r\n\"Adieu, Daphnis!\" murmured the tender Daphnè, confused and blushing.\r\n\r\nHector did not dare to follow them. He stood for a quarter of an\r\nhour with his eyes fixed first on them, and then on the door of the\r\npark. His heart beat violently, his whole soul pursued the steps of\r\nthe shepherdesses.\r\n\r\n\"'Adieu, Daphnis,' the lovely Daphnè said to me. I hear her sweet\r\nvoice still! How beautiful she is! how beautiful they are,\r\nboth--Amaranthe is more graceful, but Daphnè is more winning--bright\r\neyes--white hands! sweet smiles! and the delicious dress, so simple,\r\nyet so captivating! the white corset that I could not venture to\r\nlook at--the gown of silk that couldn't hide the points of the\r\ncharming little feet. 'Tis witchery--enchantment--Venus and Diana--I\r\nshall inevitably go mad. Ah, cousin! you ought to have come long ago,\r\nand all this might never have occurred.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun had sunk behind a bed of clouds--the nightingale began its\r\nsong, and the fresh green leaves rustled beneath the mild breath of\r\nthe evening breeze. The bee hummed joyously on its homeward way,\r\nloaded with the sweets of the spring flowers. Down in the valley,\r\nthe voice of the hinds driving their herds to rest, increased the\r\nrustic concert; the river rippled on beneath the mysterious shade of\r\nold fantastic trees, and the air was filled with soft noises, and\r\nrich perfumes, and the voice of birds. There was no room in Hector's\r\nheart for all these natural enjoyments. \"To-morrow,\" he said,\r\nkissing the broken crook--\"I will come back again to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nEarly in the following morning, Hector wandered along the banks of\r\nthe Lignon, with a fresh-cut crook in his hand. He looked to the\r\ndoor of the Park d'Urtis, expecting every moment to see the glorious\r\napparitions of the day before. And at stroke of noon, a lamb rushing\r\nthrough the gate, careered along the meadow, and the eleven others\r\nran gayly after it, amidst a peal of musical laughter from Amaranthe.\r\nDaphnè did not laugh.\r\n\r\nThe moment she crossed the threshold, she glanced stealthily\r\ntowards the river. \"I thought so,\" she murmured; \"Daphnis has come\r\nback.\" And Daphnis, in a transport of joy, was hurrying to the\r\nshepherdesses, when he was suddenly interrupted by Madame\r\nDeshoulieres and the Duchess d'Urtis. When the sisters had returned,\r\non the evening before, Amaranthe, to Daphnè's great discomfiture,\r\nhad told word for word all that had occurred; how that a young\r\nsportsman had joined them, and how they had talked and laughed; and\r\nMadame d'Urtis had no doubt, from the description, that it was Hector\r\nde Langevy. Amaranthe having added to the story, that she felt certain,\r\nin spite of Daphnè's declarations to the contrary, that he would meet\r\nthem again, the seniors had determined to watch the result. Hector\r\nwould fain have made his escape; two ladies he might have faced, but\r\nfour!--and two of them above thirty years of age! 'Twas too much; but\r\nhis retreat was instantly cut off. He stood at bay, blushed with\r\nall his might, but saluted the ladies as manfully as if he had been\r\na page. He received three most gracious curtsies in return--only\r\nthree; for Daphnè wished to pass on without taking any notice--which\r\nhe considered a very favourable omen. He did not know how to begin a\r\nconversation; and besides, he began to get confused; and his blushing\r\nincreased to a most alarming extent--and--in short--he held out his\r\ncrook to Daphnè. As that young shepherdess had no crook of her own,\r\nand did not know how to refuse the one he offered, she took it,\r\nthough her hand trenbled a little, and looked at Madame Deshoulieres.\r\n\r\n\"I broke your crook yesterday, fair Daphnè,\" said Hector, \"but it is\r\nnot lost. I shall make a relic of it--more precious than--than--\",\r\nbut the bones of the particular saint he was about to name stuck in\r\nhis throat and he was silent.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur de Langevy,\" said Madam d'Urtis kindly, \"since you make\r\nsuch a point of aiding these shepherdesses in guarding the flock, I\r\nhope in an hour you will accompany them to the castle to lunch.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go with them wherever you allow me, madam,\" said Hector.\r\n(I wonder if the impudent fellow thought he had the permission of\r\nthe young ones already.)\r\n\r\n\"Let that be settled then,\" said the Duchess. \"I shall go and have\r\nthe butter cooled, and the curds made--a simple lunch, as befits the\r\nguests.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fare of shepherds!\" said Madame Deshoulieres, and immediately\r\nset out in search of a rhyme.\r\n\r\nDaphnè had walked slowly on, pressing the crook involuntarily to her\r\nheart, and arrived at the river side, impelled by a desire for\r\nsolitude, without knowing why. There are some mysterious influences\r\nto which damsels of seventeen seem particularly subject. A lamb--the\r\ngentlest of the flock, which had become accustomed to her\r\ncaresses--had followed her like a dog. She passed her small hand\r\nlightly over the snowy neck of the favourite, and looked round to\r\nsee what the party she had left were doing. She was astonished to\r\nsee her mother and Hector conversing, as if they had been acquainted\r\nfor ages, while Madame d'Urtis and Amaranthe were running a race\r\ntowards the park. She sat down on the grassy bank, exactly opposite\r\nthe oziers where she had seen Hector the preceding day. When she\r\nfelt she was quite alone, she ventured to look at the crook. It was\r\na branch of ash of good size, ornamented with a rustic bouquet and a\r\nbunch of ribands, not very skilfully tied. Daphnè was just going to\r\nimprove the knot, when she saw a billet hid in the flowers. What\r\nshould she do?--read it? That were dangerous; her confessor did not\r\nallow such venialities--her mamma would be enraged--some people are\r\nso fond of monopolies--and besides, she might be discovered. 'Twould\r\nbe better, then, _not_ to read it--a much simpler proceeding; for\r\ncouldn't she nearly guess what was in it? And what did she care what\r\nwas in it? Not to read it was evidently the safer mode; and\r\naccordingly she--read it through and through, and blushed and smiled,\r\nand read it through and through again. It was none of your\r\ncommonplace prosaic epistles--'twas all poetry, all fire; her mamma\r\nwould have been enchanted if the verses had only been addressed to\r\nher. Here they are:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"My sweetest hour, my happiest day,\r\n  Was in the happy month of May!\r\n  The happy dreams that round me lay\r\n  On that delicious morn of May!\"\r\n\r\n  \"I saw thee! loved thee! If my love\r\n  A tribute unrejected be,\r\n  The happiest day of May shall prove\r\n  The happiest of my life to me!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident that if such an open declaration had been made\r\nin plain prose, Daphnè would have been angry; but in verse, 'twas\r\nnothing but a poetical license. Instead, therefore, of tearing it in\r\npieces, and throwing it into the water, she folded it carefully\r\nup, and placed it in the pretty corset of white satin, which seems\r\nthe natural escritoire of a shepherdess in her teens. Scarcely had\r\nshe closed the drawer, and double locked it, when she saw at her\r\nside--Hector and Madame Deshoulieres.\r\n\r\n\"My poor child,\" said the poetess, \"how thoughtful you seem on\r\nLignon's flowery side--forgetful of your sheep--\"\r\n\r\n  'That o'er the meadows negligently stray!'\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Langevy, as you have given her a crook, methinks you\r\nought to aid her in her duties in watching the flock.  As for myself,\r\nI must be off to finish a letter to my bishop.\r\n\r\n  'From Lignon's famous banks\r\n   What can I find to say?\r\n   The breezes freshly springing,\r\n   Make me--and nature--gay.\r\n   When Celadon would weep;\r\n   His lost Astrea fair,\r\n   To Lignon he would creep,\r\n   But oh! this joyous air\r\n   Would force to skip and leap\r\n   A dragon in despair!'--&c. &c.\r\n\r\nMadame Deshoulieres had no prudish notions, you will perceive, about\r\na flirtation--provided it was carried on with the airs and graces of\r\nthe Hotel Rambouillet. She merely, therefore, interposed a word here\r\nand there, to show that she was present. Daphne, who scarcely said a\r\nword to Hector, took good care to answer every time her mamma spoke\r\nto her. To be sure, it detracts a little from this filial merit,\r\nthat she did not know what she said. But if all parties were pleased,\r\nI don't see what possible right anybody else has to find fault.\r\n\r\nThe shepherdess Daphnè, or rather Bribri Deshoulieres, as we have\r\nseen, was beautiful, and simple, and tender--beautiful from the\r\nadmirable sweetness of her expression--simple, as young girls are\r\nsimple: that is to say, with a small spice of mischief to relieve\r\nthe insipidity--and tender, with a smile that seems to open the\r\nheart as well as the lips. What struck people in her expression at\r\nfirst, was a shade of sadness over her features--a fatal presentiment,\r\nas it were, that added infinitely to her charm.  Her sister was more\r\nbeautiful, perhaps--had richer roses on her cheek, and more of what\r\nis called _manner_ altogether--but if Amaranthe pleased the eyes,\r\nDaphnè captivated the heart; and as the eyes are evidently\r\nsubordinate to the heart, Daphne carried the day. Hector accordingly,\r\non the first burst of his admiration, had _seen_ nothing but\r\nAmaranthe; but when he had left the sisters, it was astonishing how\r\nexclusively he _thought_ of Daphnè.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe castle clock sounded the hour of luncheon. Hector offered his arm\r\nto Madame Deshoulieres; Daphnè called her flock. They entered the\r\npark, and were joined by the Duchess d'Urtis and Amaranthe. The\r\ncollation was magnificent. First course, an omelette au jambon, entrèe\r\ncakes, and fresh butter; second course, a superb cream cheese.\r\nDessert, a trifle and preserves. All these interesting details are\r\nembalmed in the poetic correspondence of Madame Deshoulieres, in\r\nwhich every dish was duly chronicled for the edification of her\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nAt nightfall--for Hector lingered as long as he could--the young\r\nshepherd quitted the party with great regret; but there was no time\r\nto lose, for he had two leagues to go, and there was no moon, and\r\nthe roads were still broken into immense ruts by the equinoctial\r\nrains. On the following day, Hector returned to the Chateau d'Urtis\r\nthrough the meadow. When he arrived near the willow that served for\r\nhis bridge across the river, he was surprised to see neither\r\nshepherdess nor flock in the field. He tripped across the tree,\r\nlamenting the bad omen; but scarcely had he reached the other side\r\nwhen he saw some sheep straggling here and there. He rushed towards\r\nthem, amazed at not seeing either Amaranthe or Daphnè; and what was\r\nhis enchantment when, on advancing a little further, he perceived\r\nhis adored shepherdess by the margin of the Lignon, which at that\r\npoint formed a pretty little cascade. The tender Daphnè had thrown\r\nher beautiful arm round one of the young willows in flower, and,\r\ntrusting to its support, leaned gracefully over the waterfall, in\r\nthe shadow of its odoriferous leaves. She had allowed her soul to\r\nwander in one of those delicious reveries, of which the\r\nthread--broken and renewed a thousand times--is the work of the joy\r\nwhich hopes, and the sadness which fears. She was not aware of\r\nHector's approach. When she saw him, she started, as if waking from\r\na dream.\r\n\r\n\"You are all alone,\" said Hector, drawing near.\r\n\r\nShe hurriedly told him that her sister would soon join her. The two\r\nlovers kept silence for some time, looking timidly at each other,\r\nnot venturing to speak, as if they feared the sound of their own\r\nvoices in the solitude.\r\n\r\n\"There seems a sadness,\" said Hector at length, but his voice\r\ntrembled as he spoke--\"there seems a sadness on your brow?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis true,\" replied Daphnè. \"Mamma has heard from Monsieur\r\nDeshoulieres. He is going to pass through Avignon soon, and we are\r\ngoing away to see him on his passage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Going away!\" cried Hector, turning pale.\r\n\r\n\"Yes! and I felt myself so happy,\" said Daphnè, mournfully,\r\n\"in these meadows with my sheep, that I loved so well.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Daphnè spoke of her sheep, she looked at Hector.\r\n\r\n\"But why should you go? Madame Deshoulieres could return for you here\"\r\n--\r\n\r\n\"And take me away when I had been longer here--my grief would only\r\nbe greater. No--I must go now or stay always.\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing these words Hector fell on one knee, seized her hand and\r\nkissed it, and, looking up with eyes overflowing with love, said--\r\n\r\n\"Yes--always! always!--you know that I love you, Daphnè--I wish to\r\ntell you how I will adore you all my life long.\"\r\n\r\nDaphnè yielded to her heart--and let him kiss her hand without\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\n\"But alas!\" she said, \"I can't be always guarding a flock. What will\r\nthe poor shepherdess do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I not your shepherd? your Daphnis?\" cried Hector, as if\r\ninspired--\"trust to me, Daphnè--to my heart--to my soul! This hand\r\nshall never be separated from yours: we shall live the same life--in\r\nthe sane sunshine--in the same shadow--in the same hovel--in the\r\nsame palace; but with you, dearest Daphnè, the humblest hut would be\r\na palace. Listen, my dearest Daphnè: at a short distance from here\r\nthere is a cottage--the Cottage of the Vines--that belongs to the\r\nsister of my nurse, where we can live in love and happiness--no eye\r\nto watch and no tongue to wound us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never! never!\" said Daphnè.\r\n\r\nShe snatched her hands from those of her lover, retreated a few paces,\r\nand began to cry. Hector went up to her; he spoke of his\r\naffection--he besought her with tears in his eyes--he was so\r\neloquent and so sincere, that poor Daphnè was unable to resist, for\r\nany length of time, those bewildering shocks of first love to which\r\nthe wisest of us yield: she said, all pale and trembling--\r\n\r\n\"Well--yes--I trust myself to you--and heaven. I am not to blame--is\r\nit my fault that I love you so?\"\r\n\r\nA tender embrace followed these words. Evening was now come; the sun,\r\nsinking behind the clouds on the horizon, cast but a feeble light;\r\nthe little herdsman was driving home his oxen and his flock of\r\nturkeys, whose gabbling disturbed the solemnity of the closing day.\r\nThe flock belonging to the castle turned naturally towards the\r\nwatering-place.\r\n\r\n\"Look at my poor sheep,\" said Daphnè, throwing back the curls which\r\nby some means had fallen over her forehead--\"look at my poor sheep:\r\nthey are pointing out the road I ought to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary,\" replied Hector, \"the ungrateful wretches are going\r\noff very contentedly without you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I am terrified,\" rejoined Daphnè: \"how can I leave my mother in\r\nthis way? She will die of grief!\"\r\n\r\n\"She will write a poem on it; and that will be all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will write to her that I was unable to resist my inclination for\r\na monastic life, and that I have gone, without giving her notice, to\r\nthe nunnery of St. Marie that we were speaking of last night.\"\r\n\r\nSo said the pure and candid Bribri, hitting in a moment on the\r\ningenious device; so true it is, that at the bottom of all\r\nhearts--even the most amiable--there is some small spark of mischief\r\nready to explode when we least expect it.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--dearest,\" cried Hector, delighted at the thought, \"you will\r\nwrite to her you have gone into the convent; she will go on to\r\nAvignon; we shall remain together beneath these cloudless skies, in\r\nthis lovely country, happy as the birds, and free as the winds of\r\nthe hill!\"\r\n\r\nDaphnè thought she heard some brilliant quotation from her mother,\r\nand perhaps was, on that account, the more easily led by Hector.\r\nAfter walking half an hour, with many a glance by the way, and many\r\na smile, they arrived in front of the Cottage of the Vines--the good\r\nold woman was hoeing peas in her garden--she had left her house to\r\nthe protection of an old grey cat, that was sleeping in the doorway.\r\nDaphnè was enraptured with the cottage. It was beautifully retired,\r\nand was approached by a little grass walk bordered by elder-trees;\r\nand all was closed in by a pretty orchard, in which luxuriant vines\r\nclambered up the fine old pear-trees, and formed in festoons between\r\nthe branching elms. The Lignon formed a graceful curve and nearly\r\nencircled the paddock.\r\n\r\n\"At all events,\" said Daphnè, \"if I am wretched here, my tears will\r\nfall into the stream I love.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you will have no time to weep,\" replied Hector, pressing her\r\nhand, \"all our days will be happy here! Look at that window half\r\nhidden in vine-leaves; 'tis there you will inhale the fragrance of\r\nthe garden every morning when you awake; look at that pretty bower\r\nwith the honeysuckle screen, 'tis there we will sit every evening,\r\nand talk over the joys of the day. Our life will be bright and\r\nbeautiful as a sunbeam among roses!\"\r\n\r\nThey had gone inside the cottage. It had certainly no great\r\nresemblance to a palace; but under these worn rafters--within these\r\nsimple walls--by the side of that rustic chimney--poverty itself\r\nwould be delightful, in its tidiness and simplicity, if shared with\r\none you loved. Daphnè was a little disconcerted at first by the\r\nrough uneven floor, and by the smell of the evening meal--the\r\ntoasted cheese, and the little oven where the loaf was baking; but,\r\nthanks to love--the enchanter, who has the power of transforming to\r\nwhat shape he likes, and can shed his magic splendours over any\r\nthing--Daphnè found the cottage charming, and she was pleased with\r\nthe floor, and the toasted cheese, and the oven! The good old woman,\r\non coming in from the garden, was astonished at the sight of Hector\r\nand Daphnè.\r\n\r\n\"What a pretty sister you have, Monsieur Hector!\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me, Babet--since your daughter married, nobody has used\r\nthe little room up stairs. This young lady will occupy it for a few\r\ndays; but you must keep it a secret from all the world--you\r\nunderstand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be afraid, Master Hector--I am delighted to have so pretty a\r\ntenant for my daughter's room. The bed is rather small, but it is\r\nwhite and clean, and the sheets are fresh bleached. They smell of\r\nthe daisies yet. You will sup with me, my fair young lady?\"\r\ncontinued Babet, turning to Daphnè; \"my dishes are only pewter, but\r\nthere is such a flavour in my simple fare--my vegetables and\r\nfruits--I can't account for it, except it be the blessing of heaven.\"\r\n\r\nBabet spread a tablecloth like snow, and laid some dishes of fruit\r\nupon the table. Hector took a tender farewell of Daphnè, and kissed\r\nher hand at least a dozen times. At last he tore himself away, with\r\na promise that he would be with her at daybreak next morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaphnè hardly slept all night in her chamber. She was disturbed by\r\nmany thoughts, and became alarmed at the step she had taken. At\r\nearliest dawn she threw open her window. The first sun-rays,\r\nreflected on a thousand dewdrops on the trees; the chirping of the\r\nbirds, which already began their matin song; the joyous voice of the\r\ncock, which crowed in a most satisfactory and majestic manner in the\r\npaddock of her hostess; all these sights and sounds, to which she\r\nwas so little accustomed, restored her serenity of mind once more.\r\nShe dwelt more on the attractions of her love--so adventurous, so\r\nromantic. Love's ways, like those of wickedness, are strewed at\r\nfirst with roses, and Daphnè was only at the entrance of the path.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile she was repelling from her heart the miserable fancies that had\r\ncrowded on her at night, she all of a sudden perceived Hector by the\r\nwhitethorn hedge.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome! welcome!\" she cried, \"you come to me with the sun.\"\r\n\r\n\"How lovely you are this morning!\" said Hector to her, with a look\r\nof admiration which there needed no physiognomist to discover was\r\nprofoundly real. She looked at herself when he spoke, and perceived\r\nshe was but half dressed. She threw herself on the foot of her bed.\r\n\r\n\"What am I to do?\" she thought, \"I can't always wear a silk petticoat\r\nand a corset of white satin?\"\r\n\r\nShe dressed herself notwithstanding, as last night, trusting to fate\r\nfor the morrow. Hector had brought her writing materials, and she\r\ncomposed a tender adieu to her mamma.\r\n\r\n\"Admirably done!\" cried Hector; \"I have a peasant here who will carry\r\nit to Madame Deshoulieres--as for me, I shall go as usual to the\r\nPark d'Urtis at noon. When they see me they will have no suspicion.\r\nYour mamma goes away this evening, so that after to-day we shall\r\nhave nothing to fear.\"\r\n\r\nThe lovers breakfasted in the spirits which only youth and love can\r\nfurnish. Daphnè had herself gone to the fountain with the broken\r\npitcher of the cottage. \"You perceive, Hector,\" she said, on seating\r\nherself at the table, \"that I have all the qualifications of a\r\npeasant girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"And all the gracefulness of a duchess,\" added the youth.\r\n\r\nAt one o'clock Hector had found his way to the meadow. Nobody was\r\nthere. He opened the gate of the park, and before he had gone far was\r\nmet by Madame Deshoulieres.\r\n\r\n\"My daughter!\" she cried in an agitated voice; \"You have not seen my\r\ndaughter?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was in hopes of seeing her here,\" replied Hector, with a start of\r\nwell-acted surprise.\r\n\r\n\"She is gone off,\" resumed the mother; \"gone off, like a silly\r\ncreature, to some convent, disguised as a shepherdess--the foolish,\r\nsenseless girl!--and I am obliged to depart this very day, so that\r\nit is impossible to follow her.\"\r\n\r\nHector continued to enact astonishment--he even offered his services\r\nto reclaim the fugitive--and, in short, exhibited such sorrow and\r\ndisappointment, that the habitual quickness of Madame Deshoulieres\r\nwas deceived. The Duchess, Amaranthe, and the mamma all thanked him\r\nfor his sympathy; and he at last took his leave, with no doubt in\r\nhis mind, that he was a consummate actor, and qualified for any plot\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nHe went back to Daphnè, who had sunk into despondency once more, and\r\nconsoled her by painting a brilliant picture of their future\r\nhappiness. But on the following day he came later than before--he\r\nseemed dull and listless--and embraced his shepherdess with evident\r\nconstraint. Things like these never escape the observations of\r\nshepherdesses, gentle or simple.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, Hector, that you are not by any means too gallant?--A\r\nshepherd of proper sentiments would waken his sweetheart every\r\nmorning with the sound of his pipe. He would gather flowers for her\r\nbefore the dew was gone, and fill her basket with fruits. He would\r\ncarve her initials on the bark of the tree beneath the window, as\r\nher name is written on his heart. But you! you come at nearly\r\nnoon--and leave me to attend to myself. 'Twas I, you inattentive\r\nDaphnis, who gathered all these fruits and flowers. Don't you see\r\nhow the room is improved? Hyacinths in the window, roses on the\r\nmantelpiece, and violets every where--ah! what a time you were in\r\ncoming!\"\r\n\r\nThey went out into the garden, where the good old Babet was at\r\nbreakfast, with her cat and the bees.\r\n\r\n\"Come hither,\" continued Daphnè, \"look at this little corner so\r\nbeautifully worked--'tis my own garden--I have raked and weeded it\r\nall. There is not much planted in it yet, but what a charming place\r\nit is for vines!--and the hedge, how sweet and flourishing! But what\r\nis the matter with you, Hector? You seem absent--sad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! nothing, Daphnè, nothing indeed--I only love you more and more\r\nevery hour; that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that isn't a thing to be sad about\"--said Daphnè, with a smile\r\nthat would have dispelled any grief less deeply settled than that of\r\nher young companion. He parted from Daphnè soon; without letting her\r\ninto the cause of his disquiet. But as there is no reason why the\r\nsecret should be kept any longer, let us tell what was going on at\r\nthe Chateau de Langevy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis cousin Clotilde had arrived the evening before, with an old aunt,\r\nto remain for the whole spring! Monsieur de Langevy, who was not\r\naddicted to circumlocution in his mode of talk, told his son\r\npoint-blank, that his cousin was a pretty girl, and what was more, a\r\nconsiderable heiress--so that it was his duty--his, Hector de\r\nLangevy--the owner of a great name and a very small fortune, to\r\nmarry the said cousin--or if not, he must stand the consequences.\r\nHector, at the first intimation, had revolted indignantly against\r\nthe inhuman proposal, and made many inaudible vows of undying\r\nconstancy to his innocent and trusting Daphne; but by degrees, there\r\nis no denying that--without thinking of the fortune--he found\r\nvarious attractions in his cousin. She was beautiful, graceful,\r\nwinning. She took his arm quite unceremoniously. She had the most\r\ncaptivating small-talk in the world. In short, if it had not been\r\nfor Daphnè, he would have been in love with her at once. As he was\r\nobliged, of course, to escort his cousin in her walks--or break with\r\nher altogether--he did not go for two whole days to the Cottage of\r\nthe Vines. On the third day Clotilde begged him to take her to the\r\nbanks of the Lignon, and as the request was made in presence of his\r\nfather, he dared not refuse. He contented himself--by way of a\r\nrelief to his conscience--with breathing a sigh to Daphnè. The\r\nstraightest road from the Château de Langevy to the Lignon, led past\r\nthe Cottage of the Vines--but Hector had no wish to go the\r\nstraightest road. He took a detour of nearly two miles, and led her\r\nalmost to the Park D'Urtis. While Clotilde amused herself by\r\ngathering the blossoms, and turning aside the pendent boughs of\r\nthe willows that hung over the celebrated stream. Hector looked\r\nover the scene of his first meeting with the shepherdesses, and\r\nsighed--perhaps without knowing exactly wherefore. He was suddenly\r\nstartled by a scream--Clotilde, in stretching too far forward, had\r\nmissed her footing, and fallen upon the bank; she was within an inch\r\nof rolling into the river. Hector rushed to her, raised her gently up,\r\nand begging her to lean her head upon his shoulder, assisted her up\r\nthe bank. \"She's like a naiad surprised by a shepherd\"--he\r\nthought--and it is not improbable that at that moment he pressed his\r\nlips pretty close to the pale cheek that rested almost in his breast.\r\nWhen he lifted up his head, he perceived, half hidden among the\r\nwillows, on the other side of the river--Daphnè! She had wandered to\r\nsee once more the cradle of her love, to tread the meadow where, two\r\ndays only before--could it be only two days?--she had been so happy.\r\nWhat did she see? What did she hear? As her only reply to the kiss\r\nto which she had so unfortunately been a witness, she broke her\r\ncrook in an excess of indignation. But it was too much to bear. She\r\nfell upon the bank, and uttered a plaintive cry. At that cry--at\r\nsight of his poor Daphnè fainting upon the grass, he rushed like a\r\nmadman across the stream, buoyant with love and despair. He ran to\r\nhis insensate shepherdess, regardless of the exclamations of the\r\nfair Clotilde, and raised her in his trembling arms.\r\n\r\n\"Daphnè, Daphnè,\" he cried, \"open your eyes. I love nobody but\r\nyou--nobody but you.\"\r\n\r\nHe embraced her tenderly; he wept--and spoke to her as if she heard:\r\nDaphnè opened her eyes for a moment with a look of misery--and shut\r\nthem again--and shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" she said--\"'tis over! You are no longer Daphnis, and I\r\nDaphnè no more--leave me, leave me alone--to die!\"\r\n\r\n\"My life! my love! my darling Daphnè! I love you--I swear it to you\r\nfrom my heart. I do not desert you: you are the only one I care for!\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Clotilde had approached the touching scene.\r\n\r\n\"'Pon my word, sir! very well\"--she said--\"am I to return to the\r\nChateau by myself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go, sir, go!\" said Daphnè, pushing him away, \"You are waited for,\r\nyou are called.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Daphnè--but, fair cousin\"--\r\n\r\n\"I won't listen to you--my daydream is past--speak of it no more,\"\r\nsaid Daphnè.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, cousin,\" said Clotilde, with a malicious sneer,\r\n\"that this rural surprise is quite enchanting! I am greatly obliged\r\nto you for getting it up for my amusement. You did not prepare me\r\nfor so exquisite a scene; I conclude it is from the last chapter of\r\nthe Astrea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! cousin,\" said Hector, \"I will overtake you in a moment--I will\r\ntell you all, and then I don't think you'll laugh at us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" cried Daphnè, in a tone of disdainful anger--\r\n\"let that history be for ever a secret. I do not wish people to\r\nlaugh at the weakness of my heart. Farewell, sir, let every thing be\r\nforgotten--buried!\"\r\n\r\nLarge tears rolled down the poor girl's cheek.\r\n\r\n\"No, Daphnè, no!--I never will leave you. I declare it before heaven\r\nand earth, I will conduct my cousin to the Chateau, and in an hour I\r\nwill be with you to dry your tears, and to ask pardon of you on my\r\nknees. Moreover, I am not to blame, I call my cousin to witness. Is\r\nit not true, Clotilde, that I don't love you?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Pon my word, cousin, you have certainly _told_ me you loved me;\r\nbut as men generally say the contrary of what is the fact, I am\r\nwilling to believe you don't. But I beg you'll not incommode\r\nyourself on my account; I can find my way to the Chateau perfectly\r\nwell alone.\"\r\n\r\nShe walked away, hiding her chagrin under the most easy and careless\r\nair in the world.\r\n\r\n\"I must run after her,\" said Hector, \"or she will tell every thing\r\nto my father. Adieu Daphnè; in two hours I shall be at the Cottage\r\nof the Vines, and more in love than ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Adieu, then,\" murmured Daphnè in a dying voice; \"adieu,\" she\r\nrepeated on seeing him retire; \"adieu!--as for me, in two hours, I\r\nshall _not_ be at the Cottage of Vines.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nShe returned to the cottage of old Babet. On seeing the little\r\nchamber she had taken so much pains to ornament with flowers and\r\nblossoms, she sank her head upon her bosom. \"Poor roses!\" she\r\nmurmured--\"little I thought when I gathered you, that my heart would\r\nbe the first to wither!\"\r\n\r\nThe poor old woman came in to her. \"What! crying?\" she said--\r\n\"do people weep at eighteen?\"\r\n\r\nDaphnè threw herself into Babet's arms, and sobbed.\r\n\r\n\"He has deceived me--left me for his cousin. I must go. You will\r\ntell him that he has behaved cruelly, that I am----but no!--tell him\r\nthat I forgive him.\"\r\n\r\nDaphnè loved Hector with all her heart, and with all her soul. There\r\nnever was an affection so blind, or a girl so innocent. Before\r\nleaving Paris, she had had various visions of what might happen in\r\nthe country--how she might meet some graceful cavalier beside the\r\nwall of some romantic castle, who would fling himself on his knees\r\nbefore her, like a hero of romance. And this dream, so cherished in\r\nParis, was nearly realized on the banks of the Lignon. Hector was\r\nexactly the sort of youth she had fancied, and the interest became\r\ngreater from their enacting the parts of shepherdess and shepherd.\r\nShe had been strengthened in this, her first love, by the former\r\nillusions of her imagination; and without one thought of evil, she\r\nhad lost her common sense, and had followed her lover instead of\r\nattending to her mamma. Oh, young damsels, who are fond of pastorals,\r\nand can dream of young cavaliers and ancient castles!--who hear, on\r\none side, the soft whisperings of a lover, and on the other, the\r\nsensible remarks of your mother!--need I tell you which of the two\r\nto choose? If you are still in doubt, read to the end of this story,\r\nand you will hesitate no longer.\r\n\r\nHector rejoined his cousin, but during their walk home, neither of\r\nthem ventured to allude to the incident in the meadow. Hector\r\naugured well from the silence of Clotilde--he hoped she would not\r\nspeak of his secret at the chateau. Vain hope! the moment she found\r\nan opportunity, it all came out! That evening, M. de Langevy saw her\r\nmore pensive than usual, and asked her the cause.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nothing,\" she said, and sighed.\r\n\r\nThe uncle persisted in trying to find it out.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter, my dear Clotilde?\" he said. \"Has your\r\npilgrimage to the banks of the Lignon disappointed you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, uncle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has my son---but where is Hector?\"\r\n\r\n\"He has gone on the pilgrimage again.\"\r\n\r\n\"What the devil is he doing there?\" \"He has his reasons, of course,\"\r\nsaid Clotilde.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!--Do you know what they are?\" enquired the father.\r\n\r\n\"Not the least in the world--only--\"\r\n\r\n\"Only what? I hate these only's--out with it all!\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear uncle, I've told you I know nothing about it--only I have\r\nseen his shepherdess.\"\r\n\r\n\"His shepherdess? You're laughing, Clotilde. Do you believe in\r\nshepherdesses at this time of day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, uncle--for I tell you I saw his shepherdess fall down in a\r\nfaint on the side of the Lignon.\"\r\n\r\n\"The deuce you did? A shepherdess!--Hector in love with a shepherdess!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, uncle; but a very pretty one, I assure you, in silk petticoat\r\nand corset of white satin.\"\r\n\r\nThe father was petrified. \"What is the meaning of all this? It must\r\nbe a very curious story. Bring me my fowling-piece and game-bag. Do\r\nyou think, my dear Clotilde, that infernal boy has returned to his\r\nshepherdess?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, uncle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--has the shepherdess any sheep?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, uncle.\"\r\n\r\n\"The devil! that looks more serious. You went past the withy bed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, uncle; but I fancy the gentle shepherdess is nearer the village.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" grumbled the old Baron, with a tone of voice that made\r\nit difficult to believe he saw much good in it. \"Silk petticoats and\r\nsatin corsets! I wonder where the rascal finds money for such\r\nfineries for his shepherdess.\"\r\n\r\nHe went straight on to the Cottage of the Vines, in hopes that Babet\r\nwould know something of Hector's proceedings. He found the old woman\r\nin her porch, resting from the labours of the day.\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, Babet?\" said the old Baron, softening his voice like\r\nany sucking dove. \"Anything new going on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing new, your honour,\" replied Babet, attempting to rise.\r\n\r\n\"Sit still,\" said the Baron, putting his hand kindly on the old\r\nlady's shoulder; \"here's a seat for me on this basket of rushes.\" At\r\nthis moment M. de Langevy heard the upstairs casement closed.\r\n\"Oho!\" he thought, \"I've hit upon it at once--this is the cage where\r\nthese turtles bill and coo. Have you seen my son this week, Babet?\"\r\nhe said aloud.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I see him often, your honour; he often comes sporting into my\r\npaddock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sporting in your preserves, Babet--a pretty sort of game.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very good game, your honour; this very day he sent me a\r\nbeautiful hare. I did not know what to do with it; but at last I put\r\nit on the spit.\"\r\n\r\n\"The hare wasn't all for you, perhaps. But, listen to me, Babet--I\r\nknow the whole business--my son is in love with some shepherdess or\r\nother--and I don't think she is far from here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand you, sir,\" said the old lady--a true _confidante_,\r\nthough seventy years of age.\r\n\r\n\"You understand me so perfectly,\" said the Baron, \"that you are\r\nevidently ashamed of your behaviour. But do not be uneasy, there is\r\nno great harm in it--a mere childish frolic--only tell me where the\r\ngirl is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, your honour,\" cried Babet, who saw there was no use for further\r\npretence--\"she's an angel--she is--a perfect angel!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where does the angel come from, Babet?\" enquired the Baron,\r\n\"she has not come fresh from heaven, has she?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing more about her, your honour; but I pray morning and\r\nnight that you may have no one else for a daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall see--the two lovers are above, are not they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should I conceal it? Yes, your honour, you may go up stairs at\r\nonce. An innocent love like theirs never bolts the door.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Baron was half-way up the stair, he stopped short, on\r\nseeing the two lovers sitting close to each other, the one weeping,\r\nand the other trying to console her. There was such an air of\r\ninfantine candour about them both, and both seemed so miserable,\r\nthat the hard heart of sixty-three was nearly touched.\r\n\r\n\"Very well!\"--he said, and walked into the room. Daphnè uttered a\r\nscream of terror, and her tears redoubled.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing to cry about,\" said M. de Langevy; \"but as for you,\r\nyoung man, you must let me into the secret, if you please.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing to tell you,\" said Hector, in a determined tone.\r\n\r\nDaphnè, who had leant for support on his shoulder, fell senseless on\r\nher chair.\r\n\r\n\"Father,\" said Hector, bending over her, \"you perceive that this is\r\nno place for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor for you, either,\" said the old man in a rage. \"What do you mean\r\nby such folly? Go home this instant, sir, or you shall never enter\r\nmy door again.\"\r\n\r\nBut Hector made no reply. His whole attention was bestowed on Daphnè.\r\n\r\n\"I ask you again, sir,\" said the father, still more angry at his\r\nson's neglect. \"Think well on what you do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I _have_ thought, sir,\" replied Hector, raising the head of the\r\nstill senseless Daphnè. \"You may shut your door for ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"None of your impudence, jackanapes. Will you come home with me now,\r\nor stay here?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I go with you, sir,\" said Hector, \"it will be to show my respect\r\nto you as my father, but I must tell you that I love Mademoiselle\r\nDeshoulieres, and no one else. We are engaged, and only death shall\r\npart us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Deshoulieres--Deshoulieres,\" said the Baron, \"I've heard that name\r\nbefore. I knew a Colonel Deshoulieres in the campaigns of Flanders;\r\na gallant fellow, with a beautiful wife, a number of wounds, many\r\nmedals, but not a _sou_. Are you coming, sir?\"\r\n\r\nDaphnè motioned him to go, and Hector followed his father in silence.\r\nHe was not without hopes of gaining his permission to love his poor\r\nDaphnè as much as he chose. M. de Langevy bowed to her as he went\r\nout of the room; and wishing Babet a good appetite as he passed the\r\nkitchen door, commenced a sermon for the edification of poor Hector,\r\nwhich lasted all the way. The only attention Hector paid to it was\r\nto turn round at every pause, and take a look at the little casement\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nWhen Daphnè saw him disappear among the woods at the side of the road,\r\nshe sighed; and while the tears rolled down her cheek, she said,\r\n\"Adieu, adieu! I shall never see him more!\"\r\n\r\nShe looked sadly round the little apartment--now so desolate; she\r\ngathered one of the roses that clustered round the window, and\r\nscattered the leaves one by one, and watched them as they were\r\nwafted away by the breeze.\r\n\r\n\"Even so will I do with my love,\" said the poetical shepherdess;\r\n\"I will scatter it on the winds of death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Adieu,\" she said, embracing poor old Babet; \"I am going back to the\r\nplace I left so sillily. If you see Hector again, tell him I loved\r\nhim; but that he must forget me, as I forget the world, and myself.\"\r\n\r\nAs she said these words, she grew pale and staggered, but she\r\nrecovered by an effort, and walked away on the path that led to the\r\nChateau d'Urtis. When she came to the meadow, she saw at her feet\r\nthe crook she had broken in the morning. She lifted it, and took it\r\nwith her as the only memorial of Hector. The sun was sinking slowly,\r\nand Daphnè knelt down and said a prayer, pressing the crook to her\r\nbosom--poor Daphnè!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe did not find her mother at the chateau: Madame d'Urtis was\r\noverjoyed to see her.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my lost sheep,\" she said, \"you have come back again to the\r\nfold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Daphnè, sadly; \"I am come back never to stray again. See,\r\nhere is my broken crook, and Daphnis will never come to cut me\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\nShe told every thing to Madame d'Urtis. The Duchess did not know\r\nwhether to laugh or scold; so she got over the difficulty by\r\nalternately doing both.\r\n\r\nIn the Chateau de Langevy, Hector continued firm in the presence of\r\nhis father, and even of his cousin. He told them every thing exactly\r\nas it occurred; and spoke so enthusiastically and so sincerely, that\r\nthe old Baron was somewhat softened. Clotilde herself was touched,\r\nand pled in Hector's behalf. But the old Baron was firm, and his\r\nonly answer was, \"In eight days he will forget all about her. I am\r\nastonished, Clotilde, to see you reason so absurdly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my dear uncle!\" said Clotilde, \"I believe that those who reason\r\nthe worst on such a subject are the most reasonable.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you again, in a week he will have changed his divinity--you\r\nknow that very well; or I don't see the use of your having such\r\nbeautiful eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be sure of this, uncle,\" replied Clotilde, in a more serious voice,\r\n\"Hector will never love me, and besides,\" she added, relapsing into\r\ngaiety once more, \"I don't like to succeed to another; I agree with\r\nMademoiselle de Scuderi, that, in love, those queens are the\r\nhappiest who create kingdoms for themselves in undiscovered lands.\"\r\n\r\n\"You read romances, Clotilde, so I shall argue with you no longer\r\nabout the phantom you call love.\"\r\n\r\nHector took his father on the weak side.\r\n\r\n\"If I marry Mademioiselle Deshoulieres,\" he said, \"I shall march\r\nforward in the glorious career of arms; you have opened the way for\r\nme, and I cannot fail of success under the instruction of the brave\r\nDeshoulieres, whom Louvois honours with his friendship.\"\r\n\r\nM. de Langevy put an end to the conversation by saying he would\r\nconsider--which seemed already a great step gained in favour of the\r\nlovers.\r\n\r\nOn the next day's dawn, Hector was at the Cottage of the Vines.\r\n\r\n\"Alas, alas!\" said the old woman, throwing open the window,\r\n\"the dear young lady is gone!\"\r\n\r\n\"Gone!--you let her go!--but I will find her.\"\r\n\r\nHector ran to the Chateau d'Urtis. When he entered the park, he felt\r\nhe was too late, for he saw a carriage hurrying down the opposite\r\navenue. He rang the bell, and was shown in to the Duchess.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis you, Monsieur de Langevy,\" she said, sadly; \"you come to see\r\nMademoiselle Deshoulieres. Think of her no more, for all is at an end\r\nbetween you. On this earth you will meet no more, for in an hour she\r\nwill have left the world. She is gone, with her maid, to the Convent\r\nof Val Chrétien.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gone!\" cried Hector, nearly fainting.\r\n\r\n\"She has left a farewell for you in this letter.\" Hector took the\r\nletter which the Duchess held to him, and grew deadly pale as he\r\nread these lines:--\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, then! 'Tis no longer Daphnè who writes to you, but a\r\nbroken-hearted girl, who is to devote her life to praying for the\r\nunhappy. I retire from the world with resignation. I make no\r\ncomplaint: my two days' dream of happiness is gone. It was a\r\ndelicious eclogue--pure, sincere, and tender; but it is past--Adieu!\"\r\n\r\nHector kissed the letter, and turned to the Duchess. \"Have you a\r\nhorse, madam?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"What would you do with it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would overtake Mademoiselle Deshoulieres.\"\r\n\r\n\"You might overtake her, but you couldn't turn her.\"\r\n\r\n\"For mercy's sake, madam, a horse! Take pity on my misery.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duchess ordered a horse to be saddled, for she had opposed\r\nDaphnè's design. \"Go,\" she said, \"and Heaven guide you both!\"\r\n\r\nHe started at full gallop: he overtook the carriage in half an hour.\r\n\r\n\"Daphnè, you must go no further!\" he said, holding out his hand to\r\nthe melancholy girl.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis you!\" cried Daphnè, with a look of surprise and joy--soon\r\nsucceeded by deeper grief than ever.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, 'tis I! I,\" continued the youth, \"who love you as my Daphnè,\r\nmy wife, for my father has listened at last to reason, and agrees to\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I also have listened to reason, and you know where I am going.\r\nLeave me: you are rich--I am poor: you love me to-day--who can say if\r\nyou will love me to-morrow? We began a delightful dream, let us not\r\nspoil it by a bad ending. Let our dream continue unbroken in its\r\nfreshness and romance. Our crooks are both broken; they have killed\r\ntwo of our sheep; they have cut down the willows in the meadow. You\r\nperceive that our bright day is over. The lady I saw yesterday\r\nshould be your wife. Marry her, then; and if ever, in your hours of\r\nhappiness, you wander on the banks of the Lignon, my shade will\r\nappear to you. But _then_ it shall be with a smile!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Daphnè! Daphnè! I love you! I will never leave you! I will live or\r\ndie with you!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was fifty years after that day, that one evening, during a\r\nbrilliant supper in the Rue St. Dominique, Gentil Bernard, who was\r\nthe life of the company, announced the death of an original, who had\r\nordered a broken stick to be buried along with him.\r\n\r\n\"He is Monsieur de Langevy,\" said Fontenelle. \"He was forced against\r\nhis inclination to marry the dashing Clotilde de Langevy, who eloped\r\nso shamefully with one of the Mousquetaires. M. de Langevy had been\r\ndesperately attached to Bribri Deshoulieres, and this broken stick\r\nwas a crook they had cut during their courtship on the banks of the\r\nLignon. The Last Shepherd is dead, gentlemen--we must go to his\r\nfuneral.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what became of Bribri Deshoulieres?\" asked a lady of the party.\r\n\r\n\"I have been told she died very young in a convent in the south,\"\r\nreplied Fontenelle; \"and the odd thing is, that, when they were\r\nburying her, they found a crook attached to her horse-hair tunic.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOUNDING OF THE BELL.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR MUSIC.\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES MACKAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hark! how the furnace pants and roars!\r\n  Hark! how the molten metal pours,\r\n  As, bursting from its iron doors,\r\n      It glitters in the sun!\r\n  Now through the ready mould it flows,\r\n  Seething and hissing as it goes,\r\n  And filling every crevice up\r\n  As the red vintage fills the cup:\r\n      _Hurra! the work is done_!\r\n\r\n  Unswathe him now.

Slowly, one by one,\r\nhis thoughts reassembled in his mind, and flitted to and fro as in a\r\nmist, in consequence of his extreme weakness. He felt no pain at all\r\nin his body, and his sensations were even agreeable; life seemed to\r\nhave lost its bitterness, and death its terror: in this condition he\r\nwould have listened with equal indifference to the announcement of\r\nhis recovery, or of his inevitable death. He had no wish to utter a\r\nword, or to stir a finger. This half sleep, however, did not\r\ncontinue long. At midday, after the visit of the physician, when the\r\nattendants had gone to perform the rites of noon-tide prayer, when\r\ntheir sleepy voices were still, and nought but the cry of the mullah\r\nresounded from afar, Ammalát listened to a soft and cautious step\r\nupon the carpets of the chamber. He raised his heavy eyelids, and\r\nbetween their lashes appeared, approaching his bed, a fair,\r\nblack-eyed girl, dressed in an orange-coloured sarótchka, an\r\narkhaloúkh of cloth of gold with two rows of enamelled buttons,\r\nand her long hair falling upon her shoulders. Gently she fanned\r\nhis face, and so pityingly looked at his wound that all his nerves\r\nthrilled. Then she softly poured some medicine into a cup, and--he\r\ncould see no more--his eyelids sank like lead--he only caught with\r\nhis ear the rustling of her silken dress, like the sound of a parting\r\nangel's wings, and all was still again. Whenever his weak senses strove\r\nto discover the meaning of this fair apparition, it was so mingled with\r\nthe uncertain dreams of fever, that his first thought--his first\r\nword--when he awoke, was, \"'Tis a dream!\" But it was no dream. This\r\nbeautiful girl was the daughter of the Sultan Akhmet Khan, and\r\nsixteen years old. Among all the mountaineers, in general, the\r\nunmarried women enjoy a great freedom of intercourse with the other\r\nsex, without regard to the law of Mahomet. The favourite daughter of\r\nthe Khan was even more independent than usual. By her side alone he\r\nforgot his cares and disappointments; by her side alone his eye met\r\na smile, and his heart a gleam of gayety. When the elders of Avár\r\ndiscussed in a circle the affairs of their mountain politics, or\r\ngave their judgment on right or wrong; when, surrounded by his\r\nhousehold, he related stories of past forays, or planned fresh\r\nexpeditions, she would fly to him like a swallow, bringing hope and\r\nspring into his soul. Fortunate was the culprit during whose trial\r\nthe Khána came to her father! The lifted dagger was arrested in the\r\nair; and not seldom would the Khan, when looking upon her, defer\r\nprojects of danger and blood, lest he should be parted from his\r\ndarling daughter. Every thing was permitted, every thing was\r\naccessible, to her. To refuse her any thing never entered into the\r\nmind of the Khan; and suspicion of any thing unworthy her sex and\r\nrank, was as far from his thoughts as from his daughter's heart. But\r\nwho among those who surrounded the Khan, could have inspired her\r\nwith tender feelings? To bend her thoughts--to lower her sentiments\r\nto any man inferior to her in birth, would have been an unheard-of\r\ndisgrace in the daughter of the humblest retainer; how much more,\r\nthen, in the child of a khan, imbued from her very cradle with the\r\npride of ancestry!--this pride, like a sheet of ice, separating her\r\nheart from the society of those she saw. As yet no guest of her\r\nfather had ever been of equal birth to hers; at least, her heart had\r\nnever asked the question. It is probable, that her age--of careless,\r\npassionless youth--was the cause of this; perhaps the hour of love\r\nhad already struck, and the heart of the inexperienced girl was\r\nfluttering in her bosom. She was hurrying to clasp her father in her\r\nembrace, when she had beheld a handsome youth falling like a corpse\r\nat her feet. Her first feeling was terror; but when her father\r\nrelated how and wherefore Ammalát was his guest, when the village\r\ndoctor declared that his wound was not dangerous, a tender sympathy\r\nfor the stranger filled her whole being. All night there flitted\r\nbefore her the blood-stained guest, and she met the morning-beam, for\r\nthe first time, less rosy than itself. For the first time she had\r\nrecourse to artifice: in order to look on the stranger, she entered\r\nhis room as though to salute her father, and afterwards she slipped in\r\nthere at mid-day. An unaccountable, resistless curiosity impelled her\r\nto gaze on Ammalát. Never, in her childhood, had she so eagerly longed\r\nfor a plaything; never, at her present age, had she so vehemently wished\r\nfor a new dress or a glittering ornament, as she desired to meet the eye\r\nof the guest; and when at length, in the evening, she encountered his\r\nlanguid, yet expressive gaze, she could not remove her look from the\r\nblack eyes of Ammalát, which were intently fixed on her. They seemed\r\nto say--\"Hide not thyself; star of my soul!\" as they drank health\r\nand consolation from her glances. She knew not what was passing\r\nwithin her; she could not distinguish whether she was on the earth,\r\nor floating in the air; changing colours flitted on her face. At\r\nlength she ventured, in a trembling voice, to ask him about his\r\nhealth. One must be a Tartar--who accounts it a sin and an offence\r\nto speak a word to a strange woman, who never sees any thing female\r\nbut the veil and the eye-brows--to conceive how deeply agitated was\r\nthe ardent Bek, by the looks and words of the beautiful girl\r\naddressed so tenderly to him. A soft flame ran through his heart,\r\nnotwithstanding his weakness.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am very well, now,\" he answered, endeavouring to rise;\r\n\"so well, that I am ready to die, Seltanetta.\"\r\n\r\n\"Allah sakhla-sün!\" (God protect you!) she replied. \"Live, live long!\r\nWould you not regret life?\"\r\n\r\n\"At a sweet moment sweet is death, Seltanetta! But if I live a\r\nhundred years, a more delightful moment than this can never be found!\"\r\n\r\nSeltanetta did not understand the words of the stranger; but she\r\nunderstood his look--she understood the expression of his voice. She\r\nblushed yet more deeply; and, making a sign with her hand that he\r\nshould repose, disappeared from the chamber.\r\n\r\nAmong the mountaineers there are many very skilful surgeons, chiefly\r\nin cases of wounds and fractures; but Ammalát, more than by herb or\r\nplaster, was cured by the presence of the charming mountain-maid.\r\nWith the agreeable hope of seeing her in his dreams, he fell asleep,\r\nand awoke with joy, knowing that he should meet her in reality. His\r\nstrength rapidly returned, and with his strength grew his attachment\r\nto Seltanetta.\r\n\r\nAmmalát was married; but, as it often happens in the East, only from\r\nmotives of interest. He had never seen his bride before his marriage,\r\nand afterwards found no attraction in her which could awake his\r\nsleeping heart. In course of time, his wife became blind; and this\r\ncircumstance loosened still more a tie founded on Asiatic customs\r\nrather than affection. Family disagreements with his father-in-law\r\nand uncle, the Shamkhál, still further separated the young couple,\r\nand they were seldom together. Was it strange, under the\r\ncircumstances, that a young man, ardent by nature, self-willed by\r\nnature, should be inspired with a new love? To be with her was his\r\nhighest happiness--to await her arrival his most delightful\r\noccupation. He ever felt a tremor when he heard her voice: each\r\naccent, like a ray of the sun, penetrated his soul. This feeling\r\nresembled pain, but a pain so delicious, that he would have prolonged\r\nit for ages. Little by little the acquaintance between the young\r\npeople grew into friendship--they were almost continually together.\r\nThe Khan frequently departed to the interior of Avár for business of\r\ngovernment or military arrangements, leaving his guest to the care\r\nof his wife, a quiet, silent woman. He was not blind to the\r\ninclination of Ammalát for his daughter, and in secret rejoiced at it;\r\nit flattered his ambition, and forwarded his military views; a\r\nconnexion with a Bek possessing the right to the Shamkhalát would\r\nplace in his hands a thousand means of injuring the Russians. The\r\nKhánsha, occupied in her household affairs, not infrequently left Ammalát\r\nfor hours together in her apartments--as he was a relation; and\r\nSeltanetta, with two or three of her personal attendants, seated on\r\ncushions, and engaged in needlework, would not remark how the hours\r\nflew by, conversing with the guest, and listening to his talk.\r\nSometimes Ammalát would sit long, long, reclining at the feet of his\r\nSeltanetta, without uttering a word, and gazing at her dark,\r\nabsorbing eyes; or enjoying the mountain prospect from her window,\r\nwhich opened towards the north, on the rugged banks and windings of\r\nthe roaring Ouzén, over which hung the castle of the Khan. By the\r\nside of this being, innocent as a child, Ammalát forgot the desires\r\nwhich she as yet knew not; and, dissolving in a joy, strange,\r\nincomprehensible to himself, he thought not of the past nor of the\r\nfuture; he thought of nothing--he could only feel; and indolently,\r\nwithout taking the cup from his lips, he drained his draught of bliss,\r\ndrop by drop.\r\n\r\nThus passed a year.\r\n\r\nThe Avarétzes are a free people, neither acknowledging nor suffering\r\nany power above them. Every Avarétz calls himself an Ouzdén; and if\r\nhe possesses a yezéer, (prisoner, slave,) he considers himself a\r\ngreat man. Poor, and consequently brave to extravagance, excellent\r\nmarksmen with the rifle, they fight well on foot; they ride on\r\nhorseback only in their plundering expeditions, and even then but a\r\nfew of them. Their horses are small, but singularly strong; their\r\nlanguage is divided into a multitude of dialects, but is essentially\r\nLezghin for the Avártzi themselves are of the Lezghin stock. They\r\nretain traces of the Christian faith, for it is not 120 years that\r\nthey have worshipped Mahomet, and even now they are but cool Moslems;\r\nthey drink brandy, they drink boozá, [16] and occasionally wine made\r\nof grapes, but most ordinarily a sort of boiled wine, called among\r\nthem djápa. The truth of an Avarétz's word has passed into a proverb\r\namong the mountains. At home, they are peaceful, hospitable, and\r\nbenevolent; they do not conceal their wives and daughters; for their\r\nguest they are ready to die, and to revenge to the end of the\r\ngeneration. Revenge, among them, is sacred; plundering, glory; and\r\nthey are often forced by necessity to brigandize.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: A species of drink used by the Tartars, produced by\r\nfermenting oats.]\r\n\r\nPassing over the summit of Atála and Tkhezeróuk, across the crests of\r\nTourpi-Táou, in Kakhétia, beyond the river Alazán, they find\r\nemployment at a very low price; occasionally remaining two or three\r\ndays together without work, and then, at an agreement among\r\nthemselves, they rush like famished wolves, by night, into the\r\nneighbouring villages, and, if they succeed, drive away the cattle,\r\ncarry off the women, make prisoners, and will often perish in an\r\nunequal combat. Their invasions into the Russian limits ceased from\r\nthe time when Azlan Khan retained possession of the defiles which\r\nlead into his territories from Avár. But the village of Khounzákh,\r\nor Avár, at the eastern extremity of the Avár country, has ever\r\nremained the heritage of the khans, and their command there is law.\r\nBesides, though he has the right to order his noúkers to cut to\r\npieces with their kinjáls [17] any inhabitant of Khounzákh, nay,\r\nany passer-by, the Khan cannot lay any tax or impost upon the people,\r\nand must content himself with the revenues arising from his flocks,\r\nand the fields cultivated by his karaváshes (slaves,) or yezéers\r\n(prisoners.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Dagger or poniard. These weapons are of various forms,\r\nand generally much more formidable than would be suggested to an\r\nEuropean by the name dagger. The kinjál is used with wonderful force\r\nand dexterity by the mountaineers, whose national weapon it may be\r\nsaid to be; it is sometimes employed even as a missile. It is worn\r\nsuspended in a slanting direction in the girdle, not on the side,\r\nbut in front of the body.]\r\n\r\nWithout, however, taking any direct imposts, the khans do not\r\nabstain from exacting dues, sanctified rather by force than custom.\r\nFor the Khan to take from their home a young man or a girl--to\r\ncommand a waggon with oxen or buffaloes to transport his goods--to\r\nforce labourers to work in his fields, or to go as messengers, &c.,\r\nis an affair of every day. The inhabitants of Khounzákh are not more\r\nwealthy than the rest of their countrymen; their houses are clean,\r\nand, for the most part, have two stories, the men are well made, the\r\nwomen handsome, chiefly because the greater number of them are\r\nGeorgian prisoners. In Avár, they study the Arabic language, and the\r\nstyle of their educated men is in consequence very flowery. The Harám\r\nof the Khan is always crowded with guests and petitioners, who,\r\nafter the Asiatic manner, dare not present themselves without a\r\npresent--be it but a dozen of eggs. The Khan's noúkers, on the\r\nnumber and bravery of whom he depends for his power, fill from\r\nmorning to night his courts and chambers, always with loaded pistols\r\nin their belt, and daggers at their waist. The favourite Ouzdéns and\r\nguests, Tchetchenétzes or Tartars, generally present themselves every\r\nmorning to salute the Khan, whence they depart in a crowd to the\r\nKhánsha, sometimes passing the whole day in banqueting in separate\r\nchambers, regaling even during the Khan's absence. One day there\r\ncame into the company an Ouzdén of Avár, who related the news that\r\nan immense tiger had been seen not far off, and that two of their\r\nbest shots had fallen victims to its fierceness. \"This has so\r\nfrightened our hunters,\" he said, \"that nobody likes to attempt the\r\nadventure a third time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will try my luck,\" cried Ammalát, burning with impatience to show\r\nhis prowess before the mountaineers. \"Only put me on the trail of the\r\nbeast!\" A broad-shouldered Avarétz measured with his eye our bold\r\nBek from head to foot, and said with a smile: \"A tiger is not like a\r\nboar of Daghestán, Ammalát! His trail sometimes leads to death!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think,\" answered he haughtily, \"that on that slippery path\r\nmy head would turn, or my hand tremble? I invite you not to help me:\r\nI invite you but to witness my combat with the tiger. I hope you will\r\nthen allow, that if the heart of an Avarétz is firm as the granite\r\nof his mountains, the heart of a Daghestánetz is tenpered like his\r\nfamous _boulát_. [18] Do you consent?\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: A species of highly tempered steel, manufactured, and\r\nmuch prized, by the Tartars.]\r\n\r\nThe Avarétz was caught. To have refused would have been shameful:\r\nso, clearing up his face, he stretched out his hand to Ammalát.\r\n\"I will willingly go with you,\" he replied. \"Let us not delay--let\r\nus swear in the mosque, and go to the fight together! Allah will\r\njudge whether we are to bring back his skin for a housing, or\r\nwhether he is to devour us.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not in accordance with Asiatic manners, much less with Asiatic\r\ncustoms, to bid farewell to the women when departing for a long or\r\neven an unlimited period. This privilege belongs only to relations,\r\nand it is but rarely that it is granted to a guest. Ammalát,\r\ntherefore, glanced with a sigh at the window of Seltanetta, and went\r\nwith lingering steps to the mosque. There, already awaited him the\r\nelders of the village, and a crowd of curious idlers. By an ancient\r\ncustom of Avár, the hunters were obliged to swear upon the Koran,\r\nthat they would not desert one another, either in the combat with\r\nthe beast or in the chase; that they would not quit each other when\r\nwounded; if fate willed that the animal should attack them, that\r\nthey would defend each other to the last, and die side by side,\r\ncareless of life; and that in any case they would not return without\r\nthe animal's skin; that he who betrayed this oath, should be hurled\r\nfrom the rocks, as a coward and traitor. The moollah armed them, the\r\ncompanions embraced, and they set out on their journey amid the\r\nacclamations of the whole crowd. \"Both, or neither!\" they cried\r\nafter them. \"We will slay him, or die!\" answered the hunters.\r\n\r\nA day had passed. A second had sunk below the snowy summits. The old\r\nmen had wearied their eyes in gazing from their roofs along the road.\r\nThe boys had gone far on the hills that crested the village, to meet\r\nthe hunters--but no tidings of them. Throughout all Khounzákh, at\r\nevery fireside, either from interest or idleness, they were talking\r\nof this; but above all, Seltanetta was sad. At every voice in the\r\ncourtyard, at every sound on the staircase, all her blood flew to\r\nher face, and her heart beat with anxiety. She would start up, and\r\nrun to the window or the door; and then, disappointed for the\r\ntwentieth time, with downcast eyes would return slowly to her\r\nneedlework, which, for the first time, appeared tiresome and endless.\r\nAt last, succeeding doubt, fear laid its icy hand upon the maiden's\r\nheart. She demanded of her father, her brothers, the guests, whether\r\nthe wounds given by a tiger were dangerous?--was this animal far\r\nfrom the villages? And ever and anon, having counted the moments,\r\nshe would wring her hands, and cry, \"They have perished!\" and\r\nsilently bowed her head on her agitated breast, while large tears\r\nflowed down her fair face.\r\n\r\nOn the third day, it was clear that the fears of all were not idle.\r\nThe Ouzdén, Ammalát's companion to the chase, crawled with difficulty,\r\nalone, into Khounzákh. His coat was torn by the claws of some wild\r\nbeast; he himself was as pale as death from exhaustion, hunger, and\r\nfatigue. Young and old surrounded him with eager curiosity; and\r\nhaving refreshed himself with a cup of milk and a piece of _tchourek_,\r\n[19] he related as follows:--\"On the same day that we left this place,\r\nwe found the track of the tiger. We discovered him asleep among the\r\nthick hazels--may Allah keep me from them!\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: \"Tchourek,\" a kind of bread.]\r\n\r\nDrawing lots, it fell to my chance to fire: I crept gently up, and\r\naiming well, I fired--but for my sorrow, the beast was sleeping with\r\nhis face covered by his paw; and the ball, piercing the paw, hit him\r\nin the neck. Aroused by the report and by the pain, the tiger gave a\r\nroar, and with a couple of bounds, dashed at me before I had time to\r\ndraw my dagger: with one leap, he hurled me on the ground, trode on\r\nme with his hind feet, and I only know that at this moment there\r\nresounded a cry, and the shot of Ammalát, and afterwards a deafening\r\nand tremendous roar. Crushed by the weight, I lost sense and memory,\r\nand how long I lay in this fainting fit, I know not.\r\n\r\n\"When I opened my eyes all was still around me, a small rain was\r\nfalling from a thick mist ... was it evening or morning? My gun,\r\ncovered with rust, lay beside me, Ammalát's not far off, broken in\r\ntwo; here and there the stones were stained with blood ... but whose?\r\nThe tiger's or Ammalát's? How can I tell? Broken twigs lay around ...\r\nthe brute must have broken them in his mad boundings. I called on my\r\ncomrade as loudly as I could. No answer. I sat down, and shouted\r\nagain ... but in vain. Neither animal nor bird passed by. Many times\r\ndid I endeavour to find traces of Ammalát, either to discover him\r\nalive, or to die upon his corpse--that I might avenge on the beast\r\nthe death of the brave man; but I had no strength. I wept bitterly:\r\nwhy have I perished both in life and honour! I determined to await\r\nthe hour of death in the wilderness; but hunger conquered me. Alas!\r\nthought I, let me carry to Khounzákh the news that Ammalát has\r\nperished; let me at least die among my own people! Behold me, then;\r\nI have crept hither like a serpent. Brethren, my head is before you:\r\njudge me as Allah inclines your hearts. Sentence me to life; I will\r\nlive, remembering your justice: condemn me to death; your will be\r\ndone! I will die innocent, Allah is my witness: I did what I could!\"\r\n\r\nA murmur arose among the people, as they listened to the new comer.\r\nSome excused, others condemned, though all regretted him. \"Every one\r\nmust take care of himself,\" said some of the accusers: \"who can say\r\nthat he did not fly? He has no wound, and, therefore, no proof ...\r\nbut that he has abandoned his comrade is most certain.\" \"Not only\r\nabandoned, but perhaps betrayed him,\" said others--\"they talked not\r\nas friends together!\" The Khan's noúkers went further: they\r\nsuspected that the Ouzdén had killed Ammalát out of jealousy:\r\n\"he looked too lovingly on the Khan's daughter, but the Khan's\r\ndaughter found one far his superior in Ammalát.\"\r\n\r\nSultan Akhmet Khan, learning what the people were assembling about in\r\nthe street, rode up to the crowd. \"Coward!\" he cried with mingled\r\nanger and contempt to the Ouzdén: \"you are a disgrace to the name of\r\nAvarétz. Now every Tartar may say, that we let wild beasts devour our\r\nguests, and that we know not how to defend them! At least we know how\r\nto avenge him: you have sworn upon the Koran, after the ancient\r\nusage of Avár, never to abandon your comrade in distress, and if he\r\nfall, not to return home without the skin of the beast ... thou hast\r\nbroken thine oath ... but we will not break our law: perish! Three\r\ndays shall be allowed thee to prepare thy soul; but then--if Ammalát\r\nbe not found, thou shalt be cast from the rock. You shall answer for\r\nhis head with your own!\" he added, turning to his noúkers, pulling\r\nhis cap over his eyes and directing  his horse towards his home.\r\nThirty mountaineers rushed in different directions from Khounzákh,\r\nto search for at least the remains of the Bek of Bouináki. Among the\r\nmountaineers it is considered a sacred duty to bury with honour\r\ntheir kinsmen and comrades, and they will sometimes, like the heroes\r\nof Homer, rush into the thickest of the battle to drag from the\r\nhands of the Russians the body of a companion, and will fall in\r\ndozens round the corpse rather than abandon it.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Ouzdén was conducted to the stable of the Khan; a\r\nplace frequently used as a prison. The people, discussing what had\r\nhappened, separated sadly, but without complaining, for the sentence\r\nof the Khan was in accordance with their customs.\r\n\r\nThe melancholy news soon reached Seltanetta, and though they tried to\r\nsoften it, it struck terribly a maiden who loved so deeply.\r\nNevertheless, contrary to their expectation, she appeared tranquil;\r\nshe neither wept nor complained, but she smiled no more, and uttered\r\nnot a word. Her mother spoke to her; she heard her not. A spark from\r\nher father's pipe burned her dress; she saw it not. The cold wind\r\nblew upon her bosom; she felt it not. All her feelings seemed to\r\nretire into her heart to torture her; but that heart was hidden from\r\nthe view, and nothing was reflected in her proud features. The\r\nKhan's daughter was struggling with the girl: it was easy to see\r\nwhich would yield first.\r\n\r\nBut this secret struggle seemed to choke Seltanetta: she longed to\r\nfly from the sight of man, and give the reins to her sorrow.\r\n\"O heaven!\" she thought; \"having lost him, may I not weep for him?\r\nAll gaze on me, to mock me and watch my every tear, to make sport\r\nfor their malignant tongues. The sorrows of others amuse them, Sekina,\"\r\nshe added, to her maid; \"let us go and walk on the bank of the Ouzén.\"\r\n\r\nAt the distance of three _agátcha_ [20] from Khounzákh, towards the\r\nwest, are the ruins of an ancient Christian monastery, a lonely\r\nmonument of the forgotten faith of the aborigines.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: \"Agátcha,\" seven versts, a measure for riding--for the\r\npedestrian, the agátcha is four versts.]\r\n\r\nThe hand of time, as if in veneration, has not touched the church\r\nitself, and even the fanaticism of the people has spared the\r\nsanctuary of their ancestors. It stood entire amid the ruined cells\r\nand falling wall. The dome, with its high pointed roof of stone, was\r\nalready darkened by the breath of ages: ivy covered with its tendrils\r\nthe narrow windows, and trees were growing in the crevices of the\r\nstones. Within, soft moss spread its verdant carpet, and in the\r\nsultriness a moist freshness breathed there, nourished by a fountain,\r\nwhich, having pierced the wall, fell tinkling behind the stone altar,\r\nand, dividing into silver ever-murmuring threads of pure water,\r\nfiltered among the pavement stones, and crept meandering away. A\r\nsolitary ray slanting through the window, flitted over the trembling\r\nverdure, and smiled on the gloomy wall, like a child on its\r\ngrandame's knee. Thither Seltanetta directed her steps: there she\r\nrested from the looks which so tormented her: all around was so still,\r\nso soft, so happy; and all augmented but the more her sadness: the\r\nlight trembling on the wall, the twittering of the swallows, the\r\nmurmur of the fountain, melted into tears the load that weighed upon\r\nher breast, and her sorrow dissolved into lamentation: Sekina went\r\nto pluck the pears which grew in abundance round the church; and\r\nSeltanetta could freely yield to nature.\r\n\r\nBut sudden, raising her head, she uttered an exclamation of surprise!\r\nbefore her stood a well-made Avarétz, stained with blood and mire.\r\n\"Does not your heart, do not your eyes, O Seltanetta, recognize your\r\nfavourite?\" No, but with a second glance she knew Ammalát; and\r\nforgetting all but her joy, she threw herself on his neck, embraced\r\nit with her arms, and long, long, gazed fixedly on the much-loved\r\nface; and the fire of confidence, the fire of ecstasy, glimmered\r\nthrough the still falling tears. Could then the impassioned Ammalát\r\ncontain his rapture? He clung like a bee to the rosy lips of\r\nSeltanetta; he had heard enough for his happiness; he was now at the\r\nsummit of bliss; the lovers had not yet said a word of their love,\r\nbut they already understood each other. \"And dost thou then, angel,\"\r\nadded Ammalát, when Seltanetta, ashamed of the kiss, withdrew from\r\nhis embrace: \"dost thou love me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Allah protect me!\" replied the innocent girl, lowering her eyelashes,\r\nbut not her eyes: \"Love! that is a terrible word. Last year, going\r\ninto the street, I saw them pelting a girl with stones: terrified I\r\nrushed hone, but nowhere could I hide myself: the bloody image of\r\nthe sinner was everywhere before me, and her groan yet rings\r\nunceasingly in my ears. When I asked why they had so inhumanly put\r\nto death that unhappy creature, they answered, that she loved a\r\ncertain youth!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, dearest, it was not because she loved one, but that she loved\r\nnot one alone--because she betrayed some one, it may be, that they\r\nkilled her.\"\r\n\r\n\"What means '_betrayed_,' Ammalát? I understand it not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, God grant that you may never learn what it is to betray; that\r\nyou may never forget me for another!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Ammalát, within these four days I have learned how bitter to me\r\nwas separation! For a long time I have not seen my brothers Noutsál\r\nand Soúrkha, and I meet them with pleasure; but without them I do not\r\ngrieve: without you I wish not to live!\"\r\n\r\n\"For thee I am ready to die, my morning-star: to thee I give my\r\nsoul--not only life, my beloved!\"\r\n\r\nThe sound of footsteps interrupted the lovers' talk: it was\r\nSeltanetta's attendant. All three went to congratulate the Khan, who\r\nwas consoled, and unaffectedly delighted.\r\n\r\nAmmalát related in a few words how the affair had occurred.\r\n\"Hardly had I remarked that my comrade had fallen when I fired at\r\nthe beast, flying, with a ball which broke his jaw. The monster with\r\na terrific roar began to whirl round, to leap, to roll, sometimes\r\ndarting towards me, and then again, tormented by the agony, bounding\r\naside. At this moment, striking him with the butt of my gun on the\r\nskull, I broke it. I pursued him a long time as soon as he betook\r\nhimself to flight, following him by his bloody track: the day began\r\nto fail, and when I plunged my dagger into the throat of the fallen\r\ntiger, dark night had fallen upon the earth. Would I or not, I was\r\ncompelled to pass the night with the rocks for a bed-chamber, and the\r\nwolves and jackals for companions. The morning was dark and rainy;\r\nthe clouds around my head poured their waters on me like a river. At\r\nten paces before my face nothing could be seen. Without a view of the\r\nsun, ignorant of the country, in vain I wandered round and round:\r\nweariness and hunger overwhelmed me. A partridge which I shot with my\r\npistol restored my strength for a while; but I could not find my way\r\nout of my rocky grave. In the evening the only sounds I could hear\r\nwere the murmur of water falling from a cliff, or the whistling of\r\nthe eagles' wings as they flew through the clouds; but at night the\r\naudacious jackals raised, three paces off, their lamentable song.\r\nThis morning the sun rose brightly, and I myself arose more cheerful,\r\nand directed my steps towards the east. I shortly afterwards heard a\r\ncry and a shot: it was your messengers. Overcome by heat, I went to\r\ndrink the pure water of the fountain by the old mosque, and there I\r\nmet Seltanetta. Thanks be to you, and glory to God!\"\r\n\r\n\"Glory to God, and honour to you!\" exclaimed the Sultan, embracing\r\nhim. \"But your courage has nearly cost us your life, and even that\r\nof your comrade. If you had delayed a day, he would have been obliged\r\nto dance the Sézghinka in the air. You have returned just in time.\r\nDjemboulá't, a famous cavalier of Little Kabárda, has sent to invite\r\nyou to a foray against the Russians. I would willingly buy\r\nbeforehand your glory; as much as you won in your last battle. The\r\ntime is short; tomorrow's sun must see you ready.\"\r\n\r\nThis news was by no means unwelcome to Ammalát: he decided instantly;\r\nanswering, that he would go with pleasure. He felt sure that a\r\ndistinguished reputation as a cavalier would ensure him future\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nBut Seltanetta turned pale--bowing her head like a flower, when she\r\nheard of this new and more cruel separation. Her look, as it dwelt\r\nupon Ammalát, showed painful apprehension--the pain of prophetic\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\n\"Allah!\" she mournfully exclaimed: \"more forays, more slaughter.\r\nWhen will blood cease to be shed in the mountains?\"\r\n\r\n\"When the mountain torrents run milk, and the sugar-canes wave on the\r\nsnowy peaks!\" said the Khan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nWildly beautiful is the resounding Térek in the mountains of Dariál.\r\nThere, like a genie, borrowing his strength from heaven, he wrestles\r\nwith Nature. There bright and shining as steel, cutting through the\r\novershadowing cliff, he gleams among the rocks. There, blackening\r\nwith rage, he bellows and bounds like a wild beast, among the\r\nimprisoning cliffs: he bursts, overthrows, and rolls afar their\r\nbroken fragments. On a stormy night, when the belated traveller,\r\nenveloped in his furry boúrka, gazing fearfully around him, travels\r\nalong the bank which hangs over the torrent of Térek, all is terror\r\nsuch as only a vivid imagination can conceive. With slow steps he\r\nwinds along, the rain-torrents stream around his feet, and tumble\r\nupon his head from the rocks which frown above and threaten his\r\ndestruction. Suddenly the lightning flashes before his eyes--with\r\nhorror he beholds but a black cloud above him, below a yawning gulf,\r\nbeside him crags, and before him the roaring Térek. At one moment he\r\nsees its wild and troubled waves raging like infernal spirits chased\r\nby the archangel's brand. After them, with a shout as of laughter,\r\nroll the huge stones. In another moment, the blinding flash is gone,\r\nand he is plunged once more in the dark ocean of night: then bursts\r\nthe thunder-crash, jarring the foundations of the rocks, as though a\r\nthousand mountains were dashed against each other, so deafeningly do\r\nthe echoes repeat the bellow of the heavens. Then a long-protracted\r\ngrowl, as of massive oaks plucked up by their roots, or the crash of\r\nbursting rocks, or the yell of the Titans as they were hurled\r\nheadlong into the abyss; it mingles with the war of the blast, and\r\nthe blast swells to a hurricane, and the rain pours down in torrents.\r\nAnd again the lightning blinds him, and again the thunder, answering\r\nfrom afar to the splinter-crash, deafens him. The terrified steed\r\nrears, starts backward--the rider utters a short prayer.\r\n\r\nBut after this how softly smiles the morning--morn, in whose light\r\nTérek glides, and ripples, and murmurs! The clouds, like a torn veil\r\nwhirling on the breeze, appear and vanish fitfully among the icy\r\npeaks. The sunbeams discover jagged profiles of the summits on the\r\nopposing mountain wall. The rocks glitter freshly from the rain. The\r\nmountain-torrents leap through the morning mist; and the mists\r\nthemselves creep winding through the cliffs, even as the smoke from a\r\ncottage chimney, then twine themselves like a turban round some\r\nancient tower, while Térek ripples on among the stones, curling as a\r\ntired hound who seeks a resting-place.\r\n\r\nIn the Caucasus, it must be confessed, there are no waters in which\r\nthe mountains can worthily reflect themselves--those giants of\r\ncreation. There are no gentle rivers, no vast lakes; but Térek\r\nreceives in his stream the tribute of a thousand streamlets. Beneath\r\nthe further Caucasus, where the mountains melt into the plain, he\r\nseems to flow calmly and gently, he wanders on in huge curves,\r\ndepositing the pebbles he has brought down from the hills. Further on,\r\nbending to the north-west, the stream is still strong, but less noisy,\r\nas though wearied with its fierce strugglings. At length, embraced\r\nby the narrow gorge of Cape M. áloi (Little Kabárdi,) the river,\r\nlike a good Moslem, bending religiously to the east, and peacefully\r\nspreading over the hated shore, gliding sometimes over beds of stone,\r\nsometimes over banks of clay, falls, by Kizlár, into the basin of\r\nthe Caspian. There alone does it deign to bear boats upon its waters,\r\nand, like a labourer, turn the huge wheels of floating mills. On its\r\nright bank, among hillocks and thickets, are scattered the villages\r\n(aoúle) of the Kabardínetzes, a tribe which we confound under one\r\nname with the Tcherkéss, (Circassians,) who dwell beyond the Koubán,\r\nand with the Tchetchenétzes much lower by the sea. These villages on\r\nthe bank are peaceful only in name, for in reality they are the\r\nhaunts of brigands, who acknowledge the Russian government only as\r\nfar as it suits their interest, capturing, as Russian subjects, from\r\nthe mountaineers, the plunder they seize in the Russian frontier.\r\nEnjoying free passage on all sides, they inform those of the same\r\nreligion and the same way of thinking, of the movement of our troops,\r\nand the condition of our fortresses; conceal them among themselves\r\nwhen they are assembling for an incursion, buy their plunder at their\r\nreturn, furnish them with Russian salt and powder, and not rarely\r\ntake themselves a part, secret or open, in their forays. It is\r\nexceedingly irritating to see, even in full view of these\r\nmountaineers, nations hostile to us boldly swim over the Térek, two,\r\nthree, or five men at a time, and in broad day set to work to rob;\r\nit being useless to pursue them, as their dress has nothing to\r\ndistinguish them from the friendly tribes. On the opposite bank,\r\nthough apparently quite peaceable, and employing this as their excuse,\r\nthey fall, when in force, upon travellers, carry off cattle and men\r\nwhen off their guard, slaughter them without mercy, or sell them\r\ninto slavery at a distance. To say the truth, their natural position,\r\nbetween two powerful neighbours, of necessity compels them to have\r\nrecourse to these stratagems. Knowing that the Russians will not\r\npass to the other side of the river to protect them from the revenge\r\nof the mountaineers, who melt away like snow at the approach of a\r\nstrong force, they easily and habitually, as well as from inevitable\r\ncircumstances, ally themselves to people of their own blood, while\r\nthey affect to pay deference to the Russians, whom they fear.\r\n\r\nIndeed, there exists among them certain persons really devoted to the\r\nRussians, but the greater number will betray even their own\r\ncountrymen for a bribe. In general, the morality of these peaceful\r\nallies of ours is completely corrupted; they have lost the courage\r\nof an independent people, and have acquired all the vices of\r\nhalf-civilization. Among them an oath is a jest; treachery, their\r\nglory; even hospitality, a trade. Each of them is ready to engage\r\nhimself to the Russians in the morning, as a kounák (friend), and at\r\nnight to guide a brigand to rob his new friend.\r\n\r\nThe left bank of the Térek is covered with flourishing stanítzas [21]\r\nof the Kazáks of the Line, the descendants of the famous Zaporójetzes.\r\nAmong them is here and there a Christian village. These Kazáks are\r\ndistinguished from the mountaineers only by their unshaven heads: their\r\ntools, dress, harness, manners--all are of the mountains. They like the\r\nalmost ceaseless war with the mountaineers; it is not a battle, but a\r\ntrial of arms, in which each party desires to gain glory by his\r\nsuperiority in strength, valour, and address. Two Kazáks would not\r\nfear to encounter four mountain horsemen, and with equal numbers\r\nthey are invariably victors. Lastly, they speak the Tartar language;\r\nthey are connected with the mountaineers by friendship and alliance,\r\ntheir women being mutually carried off into captivity; but in the\r\nfield they are inflexible enemies. As it is not forbidden to make\r\nincursions on the mountain side of the Térek, the brigands\r\nfrequently betake themselves thither by swimming the river, for the\r\nchase of various kinds of game. The mountain brigands, in their turn,\r\nfrequently swim over the Térek at night, or cross it on bourdoúchs,\r\n(skins blown up,) hide themselves in the reeds, or under a\r\nprojection of the bank, thence gliding through the thickets to the\r\nroad, to carry off an unsuspecting traveller, or to seize a woman,\r\nas she is raking the hay. It sometimes happens that they will pass a\r\nday or two in the vineyards by the village, awaiting a favourable\r\nopportunity to fall upon it unexpectedly; and hence the Kazák of the\r\nLine never stirs over his threshold without his dagger, nor goes\r\ninto the field without his gun at his back: he ploughs and sows\r\ncompletely armed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Villages of Kazáks.]\r\n\r\nFor some time past, the mountaineers had fallen in considerable\r\nnumbers only on Christian villages, for in the stanítzas the\r\nresistance had cost them very dear. For the plundering of houses;\r\nthey approached boldly yet cunningly the Russian frontier, and on\r\nsuch occasions they frequently escaped a battle. The bravest Ouzdéns\r\ndesire to meet with these affairs that they may acquire fame, which\r\nthey value even more than plunder.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of the year 1819, the Kabardínetzes and Tchetchenétzes,\r\nencouraged by the absence of the commander-in-chief, assembled to the\r\nnumber of 1500 men to make an attack upon one of the villages beyond\r\nthe Térek, to seize it, carry off prisoners, and take the droves of\r\nhorses. The leader of the Kabardínetzes was the Prince (Kniázek)\r\nDjenboulát. Ammalát Bek, who had arrived with a letter from Sultan\r\nAkhmet Khan, was received with delight. They did not, indeed, assign\r\nhim the command of any division; but this arose from the\r\ncircumstance that with them there is no order of battle or gradation\r\nof command; an active horse and individual courage secures the most\r\ndistinguished place in action. At first they deliberate how best to\r\nbegin the attack--how to repel the enemy; but afterwards they pay no\r\nattention to plan or order, and chance decides the affair. Having\r\nsent messengers to summon the neighbouring Ouzdéns, Djemboulát fixed\r\non a place of assembling; and immediately, on a signal agreed on,\r\nfrom every height spread the cry, \"Gharái, gharái!\" (alarm,) and in\r\none hour the Tchetchenétzes and Kabardínetzes were assembling from\r\nall sides. To avoid treason, no one but the leader knew where the\r\nnight-camp was to be, from which they where to cross the river. They\r\nwere divided into small bands, and were to go by almost invisible\r\npaths to the peaceful village, where they were to conceal themselves\r\ntill night. By twilight, all the divisions were already mustered. As\r\nthey arrived, they were received by their countrymen with frank\r\nembraces; but Djemboulát, not trusting to this, guarded the village\r\nwith sentinels, and proclaimed to the inhabitants, that whoever\r\nattempted to desert to the Russians should be cut in pieces. The\r\ngreater part of the Ouzdéns took up their quarters in the sáklas of\r\ntheir kounáks or relations; but Djemboulát and Ammalát, with the\r\nbest of the cavaliers, slept in the open air round a fire, when they\r\nhad refreshed their jaded horses. Djemboulát, wrapped in his boúrka,\r\nwas considering, with folded arms, the plan of the expedition; but\r\nthe thoughts of Ammalát were far from the battle-field: they were\r\nflying, eagle-winged, to the mountains of Avar, and bitterly,\r\nbitterly did he feel his separation. The sound of an instrument, the\r\nmountain balaláika, (kanous,) accompanying a slow air, recalled him\r\nfrom his reverie, and a Kabardínetz sung an ancient song.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"On Kazbék the clouds are meeting,\r\n    like the mountain eagle-flock;\r\n    up to them, along the rock,\r\n  Dash the wild Ouzdéns retreating;\r\n  Onward faster, faster fleeting,\r\n    Routed by the Russian brood.\r\n    Foameth all their track with blood.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Fast behind the regiments yelling,\r\n    Lance and bayonet raging hot,\r\n    And the seed of death their shot.\r\n  On the mail the sabre dwelling\r\n  Gallop, steed! for far thy dwelling--\r\n    See! they fall--but distant still\r\n    Is the forest of the hill!\"\r\n\r\n  \"Russian shot our hearts is rending,\r\n    Falls the Mullah on his knee,\r\n    To the Lord of Light bows he,\r\n  To the Prophet he is bending:\r\n  Like a shaft his prayer ascending,\r\n    Upward flies to Allah's throne--\r\n  Il-Alláh! O save thine own!\"\r\n\r\n  \"Ah, despair!--What crash like thunder!\r\n    Lo! a sign from heaven above!\r\n    Lo! the forest seems to move\r\n  Crashes, murmurs, bursts asunder!\r\n  Lower, nearer, wonder! wonder!\r\n    Safe once more the Moslem bold\r\n    In their forest mountain-hold!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"So it was in old times,\" said Djemboulát, with a smile, \"when our\r\nold men trusted more to prayer, and God oftener listened to them; but\r\nnow, my friends, there is a better hope--your valour! _Our_ omens are\r\nin the scabbards of our shoóshkas, (sabres,) and we must show that we\r\nare not ashamed of them. Harkye, Ammalát,\" he continued, twisting his\r\nmustache, \"I will not conceal from you that the affair may be warm. I\r\nhave just heard that Colonel K---- has collected his division; but\r\nwhere he is, or how many troops he has, nobody knows.\"\r\n\r\n\"The more Russians there are the better,\" replied Ammalát, quietly;\r\n\"the fewer mistakes will be made.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the heavier will be the plunder.\"\r\n\r\n\"I care not for that. I seek revenge and glory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Glory is a good bird, when she lays a golden egg; but he that\r\nreturns with his toróks (straps behind the saddle) empty, is ashamed\r\nto appear before his wife. Winter is near, and we must provide our\r\nhouseholds at the expense of the Russians, that we may feast our\r\nfriends and allies. Choose your station, Ammalát Bek. Do you prefer\r\nto advance in front to carry off the flocks, or will you remain with\r\nme in the rear? I and the Abréks will march at a foot's pace to\r\nrestrain the pursuers.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what I also intend. I will be where the greatest peril is.\r\nBut what are the Abréks, Djemboulát?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not easy to explain. You sometimes see several of our boldest\r\ncavaliers take an oath, binding them for two or three years, or as\r\nlong as they like, never to mingle in games or gayeties, never to\r\nspare their lives in battle, to give no quarter, never to pardon the\r\nleast offence in a brother or a friend, to seize the goods of others\r\nwithout fear or scruple--in a word, to be the foes of all mankind,\r\nstrangers in their family, men whom any person may slay if he can;\r\nin the village they are dangerous neighbours, and in meeting them\r\nyou must keep your hand on the trigger; but in war one can trust them.\"\r\n[22]\r\n\r\n\"For what motive, or reason, can the Ouzdens make such an engagement?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some simply to show their courage, others from poverty, a third\r\nclass from some misfortune. See, for instance, yonder tall Kabardínetz;\r\nhe has sworn to be an Abrék for five years, since his mistress\r\ndied of the small-pox. Since that year it would be as well to make\r\nacquaintance with a tiger as with him. He has already been wounded\r\nthree times for blood-vengeance; but he cares not for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange custom! How will he return from the life of an Abrék to a\r\npeaceable existence?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is there strange in this? The past glides from him as water\r\nfrom the wild-duck. His neighbours will be delighted when he has\r\nfinished his term of brigandage. And he, after putting off Abrétchestva\r\n(Abrékism) as a serpent sheds his skin, will become gentle\r\nas a lamb. Among us, none but the avenger of blood remembers\r\nyesterday. But the night is darkening. The mists are spreading over\r\nTérek. It is time for the work.\"\r\n\r\nDjemboulát whistled, and his whistle was repeated to all the\r\noutposts of the camp. In a moment the whole band was assembled.\r\nSeveral Ouzdéns joined from the neighbouring friendly villages.\r\nAfter a short discussion as to the passage of the river, the band\r\nmoved in silence to the bank. Ammalát Bek could not but admire the\r\nstillness, not only of the riders, but of their horses; not one of\r\nthem neighed or snorted, and they seemed to place their feet on the\r\nground with caution. They marched like a voiceless cloud, and soon\r\nthey reached the bank of Térek, which, making a winding at this spot,\r\nformed a promontory, and from it to the opposite shore, extended a\r\npebbly shoal. The water over this bank was shallow and fordable;\r\nnevertheless, a part of the detachment left the shore higher up, in\r\norder to swim past the Kazáks, and, diverting their attention from\r\nthe principal passage, to cover the fording party. Those who had\r\nconfidence in their horses, leaped unhesitatingly from the bank,\r\nwhile others tied to each fore-foot of their steeds a pair of small\r\nskins, inflated with air like bladders; the current bore them on,\r\nand each landed wherever he found a convenient spot. The\r\nimpenetrable veil of mist concealed all these movements. It must be\r\nremarked, that along the whole line of the river is a chain of mayáks\r\n(watch-towers) and a cordon of sentinels: on all the hills and\r\nelevated spots are placed look-outs. On passing before them in the\r\ndaytime, may be seen on each hillock a pole, surmounted with a small\r\nbarrel. This is filled with pitch and straw, and is ready to be\r\nlighted on the first alarm. To this pole is generally tied a Kazák's\r\nhorse, and by his side a sentinel. In the night, these sentinels are\r\ndoubled; but in spite of the precautions, the Tcherkéss, concealed\r\nby the fog, and clothed in their boúrka, sometimes pass through the\r\nline in small bodies, as water glides through a sieve. The same\r\nthing happened on this occasion: perfectly acquainted with the\r\ncountry, the Beláds, (guides) peaceable Tcherkéss, led each party,\r\nand in profound silence avoided the hillocks.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: This is exactly the Berserkir of the ancient Northmen.\r\nExamples of this frantic courage are not rare among the Asiatics.]\r\n\r\nIn two places only had the brigands, to break through the line of\r\nwatch-fires which might have betrayed them, resolved to kill the\r\nsentinels. Against one picket, Djemboulát proceeded himself, and he\r\nordered another Bek to creep up the bank, pass round to the rear of\r\nthe picket, count a hundred, and then to strike fire with a flint\r\nand steel several times. It was said and done. Just lifting his head\r\nabove the edge of the bank, Djemboulát saw a Kazák slumbering with\r\nthe match in his hand, and holding his horse by the bridle. As soon\r\nas the clicking struck his ear, the sentinel started, and turned an\r\nanxious look on the river. Fearing that the sentinel did not remark\r\nhim, Djemboulát threw up his cap, and again crouched down behind the\r\nbank. \"Accursed duck!\" said the Donétz; \"for this night is a carnival.\r\nThey squatter away like the witches of Kíeff.\" At this moment, the\r\nsparks appeared on the opposite side, and drew his attention: \"'Tis\r\nthe wolves,\" thought he: \"sometimes their eyes glitter brightly!\" But\r\nthe sparks reappearing, he was stupefied, remembering stories that\r\nthe Tchetchenétzes sometimes use this kind of signal to regulate the\r\nmovements of their march. This moment of suspense and irresolution was\r\nthe moment of his destruction; a dagger [23], directed by a strong arm,\r\nwhistled through the air, and the Kazák, transfixed, fell without a\r\ngroan to the earth. His comrade was sabred in his sleep, and the pole\r\nwith the tub was torn down, and was thrown into the river. All then\r\nrapidly assembled at the given signal, and dashed in a moment on the\r\nvillage which they had determined to attack. The blow was successfully,\r\nthat is, quite unexpectedly, struck. Such of the peasants as had time\r\nto arm, were killed after a desperate resistance: the others hid\r\nthemselves or fled. Besides the plunder, a number of men and women\r\nwas the reward of their boldness. The Kabardínetzes broke into the\r\nhouses, carrying off all that was most valuable, indeed every thing\r\nthat came to hand: but they did not set fire to the houses, nor did\r\nthey tread down the corn, nor break the vines: \"Why touch the gift\r\nof God, and the labour of man?\" said they; and this rule of a\r\nmountain robber, who shrinks at no crime, is a virtue which the most\r\ncivilized nations might envy. In an hour, all was over for the\r\ninhabitants, but not for the brigands. The alarm spread along the\r\nline, and the mayáks soon began to glimmer through the fog like the\r\nstars of morning, while the call to arms resounded in every direction.\r\nIn this interval, a party of the more experienced among the brigands\r\nhad gone round the troop of horses which was grazing far in the\r\nsteppe. The herdsman was seized, and with cries, and firing their\r\nguns, they charged at the horses from the land side. The animals\r\nstarted, threw mane and tail into the air, and dashed headlong on\r\nthe track of a Tcherkéss mounted on a superb steed, who had remained\r\non the bank of the river to guide the frightened herd. Like a\r\nskilful pilot, well acquainted, even in a fog, with all the dangers\r\nof the desert sea, the Tcherkéss flew on before the horses, wound\r\nhis way among the posts, and at last, having chosen a spot where the\r\nbank was most precipitous, leaped headlong into the Térek. The whole\r\nherd followed him: nothing could be seen but the foam that flew into\r\nthe air. Daybreak appeared; the fog began to separate, and\r\ndiscovered a picture at once magnificent and terrible. The principal\r\nband of forayers dragged the prisoners after it--some were at the\r\nstirrup, others behind the saddle, with their arms tied at their\r\nbacks. Tears, and groans, and cries of despair were stifled by the\r\nthreats and frantic cries of joy of the victors. Loaded with plunder,\r\nimpeded by the flocks and horned cattle, they advanced slowly\r\ntowards the Térek. The princes and best cavaliers, in mail-coats and\r\ncasques glittering like water, galloped around the dense mass, as\r\nlightning flashes round a livid cloud. In the distance, were\r\ngalloping up from every point the Kazáks of the Line; they ambushed\r\nbehind the shrubs and straggling oak-trees, and soon began an irregular\r\nfire with the brigands who were sent against them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: The Tartars and Circassians possess extraordinary\r\ndexterity in the use of their national weapon--the kinjál, or poniard.\r\nThese are sometimes of great size and weight, and when thrown by a\r\nskilful hand, will fly a considerable distance, and with the most\r\nsingular accuracy of aim.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the foremost had driven across the river a portion\r\nof the flocks, when a cloud of dust, and the tramp of cavalry,\r\nannounced the approaching storm. About six hundred mountaineers,\r\ncommanded by Djemboulát and Ammalát, turned their horses to repulse\r\nthe attack, and give time to the rest to escape by the river.\r\nWithout order, but with wild cries and shouts, they dashed forward\r\nto meet the Kazáks; but not a single gun was taken from its belt,\r\nnot a single sháshka glimmered in the air: a Tcherkéss waits till\r\nthe last moment before he seizes his weapons. And thus, having\r\ngalloped to the distance of twenty paces, they levelled their\r\nguns, fired at full speed, threw their fire-arms over their backs,\r\n[24] and drew their sháshkas; but the Kazáks of the Line having\r\nreplied with a volley, began to fly, and the mountaineers, heated by\r\nthe chase, fell into a stratagem which they often employ themselves.\r\nThe Kazáks had led them up to the chasseurs of the brave forty-third\r\nregiment, who were concealed at the edge of the forest. Suddenly, as\r\nif the little squares had started out of the earth, the bayonets\r\nwere leveled, and the fire poured on them, taking them in flank. It\r\nwas in vain that the mountaineers, dismounting from their horses,\r\nessayed to occupy the underwood, and attack the Russians from the\r\nrear; the artillery came up, and decided the affair. The experienced\r\nColonel Kortsaréff, the dread of the Tchetchenétz, the man whose\r\nbravery they feared, and whose honesty and disinterestedness they\r\nrespected, directed the movements of the troops, and success could\r\nnot be doubtful. The cannon dispersed the crowds of brigands, and\r\ntheir grape flew after the flying. The defeat was terrible; two\r\nguns, dashing at a gallop to the promontory, not far from which the\r\nTcherkéss were throwing themselves into the river, enfiladed the stream;\r\nwith a rushing sound, the shot flew over the foaming waves, and at\r\neach fire some of the horses might be seen to turn over with their\r\nfeet in the air, drowning their riders. It was sad to see how the\r\nwounded clutched at the tails and bridles of the horses of their\r\ncompanions, sinking them without saving themselves--how the\r\nexhausted struggled against the scarped bank, endeavouring to\r\nclamber up, fell back, and were borne away and engulfed by the\r\nfurious current. The corpses of the slain were whirled away, mingled\r\nwith the dying and streaks of blood curled and writhed like serpents\r\non the foam. The smoke floated far along the Térek, far in the\r\ndistance, and the snowy peaks of Caucasus, crowned with mist,\r\nbounded the field of battle. Djemboulát and Ammalát Bek fought\r\ndesperately--twenty times did they rush to the attack, twenty times\r\nwere they repulsed; wearied, but not conquered, with a hundred\r\nbrigands they swam the river, dismounted, attached their horses to\r\neach other by the bridle, and began a warm fire from the other side\r\nof the river, to cover their surviving comrades. Intent upon this,\r\nthey remarked, too late, that the Kazáks were passing the river above\r\nthem; with a shout of joy, the Russians leaped upon the bank, and\r\nsurrounded them in a moment. Their fate was inevitable. \"Well,\r\nDjemboulát,\" said the Bek to the Kabardínetz, \"our lot is finished.\r\nDo you what you will; but for me, I will not render myself a\r\nprisoner alive. 'Tis better to die by a ball than by a shameful cord!\"\r\n\"Do you think,\" answered Djemboulát, \"that my arms were made for a\r\nchain! Allah keep me from such a blot: the Russians may take my body,\r\nbut not my soul. Never, never! Brethren, comrades!\" he cried to the\r\nothers; \"fortune has betrayed us, but the steel will not. Let us\r\nsell our lives dearly to the Giaour. The victor is not he who keeps\r\nthe field, but he who has the glory; and the glory is his who\r\nprefers death to slavery!\" \"Let us die, let us die; but let us die\r\ngloriously,\" cried all, piercing with their daggers the sides of\r\ntheir horses, that the enemy might not take them, and then piling\r\nup the dead bodies of their steeds, they lay down behind the\r\nheap, preparing to meet the attack with lead and steel. Well aware of\r\nthe obstinate resistance they were about to encounter, the Kazáks\r\nstopped, and made ready for the charge. The shot from the opposite\r\nbank sometimes fell in the midst of the brave mountaineers,\r\nsometimes a grenade exploded, covering them with earth and fragments;\r\nbut they showed no confusion, they started not, nor blenched; and,\r\nafter the custom of their country, began to sing, with a melancholy,\r\nyet threatening voice, the death-song, replying alternately stanza\r\nfor stanza.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: The oriental nations carry their guns at their backs,\r\nsupported by a strap passing across the breast.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH-SONG.\r\n\r\n  CHORUS.\r\n\r\n  \"Fame to us, death to you,\r\n  Alla-ha, Alla-hu!!\"\r\n\r\n  SEMICHORUS.\r\n\r\n  \"Weep, O ye maidens, on mountain and valley,\r\n  Lift the dirge for the sons of the brave;\r\n  We have fired our last bullet, have made our last rally,\r\n  And Caucasus gives us a grave.\r\n  Here the soft pipe no more shall invite us to slumber\r\n  --The thunder _our_ lullaby sings;\r\n  Our eyes not the maiden's dark tresses shall cumber,\r\n  _Them_ the raven shall shade with his wings!\r\n  Forget, O my children, your father's stern duty--\r\n  No more shall he bring ye the Muscovite booty!\"\r\n\r\n  SECOND SEMICHORUS.\r\n\r\n  \"Weep not, O ye maidens; your sisters in splendour,\r\n  The Houris, they bend from the sky,\r\n  They fix on the brave their sun-glance deep and tender,\r\n  And to Paradise bear him on high!\r\n  In your feast-cup, my brethren, forget not our story;\r\n  The death of the Free is the noblest of glory!\"\r\n\r\n  FIRST SEMICHORUS.\r\n\r\n  \"Roar, winter torrent, and sullenly dash!\r\n  But where is the brave one--the swift lightning-flash?\r\n    Soft star of my soul, my mother,\r\n    Sleep, the fire let ashes smother;\r\n  Gaze no more, shine eyes are weary,\r\n    Sit not by the threshold stone;\r\n  Gaze not through the night-fog dreary,\r\n    Eat thine evening meal alone,\r\n  Seek him not, O mother, weeping,\r\n    By the cliff and by the ford:\r\n  On a bed of dust he's sleeping--\r\n    Broken is both heart and sword!\"\r\n\r\n  SECOND SEMICHORUS.\r\n\r\n  \"Mother, weep not! with thy love burning:\r\n    This heart of mine beats full and free,\r\n  And to lion-blood is turning\r\n    That soft milks I drew from thee;\r\n  And our liberty from danger\r\n    Thy brave son has guarded well;\r\n  Battling with the Christian stranger,\r\n    Call'd by Azrael, he fell;\r\n  From my blood fresh odours breathing\r\n    Fadeless flowers shall drink the dew;\r\n  To my children fame bequeathing,\r\n    Brethren, and revenge to you!\"\r\n\r\n  CHORUS.\r\n\r\n  \"Pray, my brethren, ere we part;\r\n    Clutch the steel with hate and wrath!\r\n  Break it in the Russian's heart--\r\n  O'er corpses lies the brave man's path!\r\n     Fame to us, death to you,\r\n    Alla-ha, Alla-hu!\"\r\n\r\nStruck by a certain involuntary awe, the Chasseurs and Kazáks\r\nlistened in silence to the stern sounds of this song; but at last a\r\nloud _hurrah_ [25] resounded from both sides. The Teherkéss, with a\r\nshout, fired their guns for the last time, and breaking them against\r\nthe stones, they threw themselves, dagger in hand, upon the Russians.\r\nThe Abréks, in order that their line might not be broken, bound\r\nthemselves to each other with their girdles, and hurled themselves\r\ninto the mêlée. Quarter was neither asked nor given: all fell before\r\nthe bayonets of the Russians. \"Forward! follow me, Ammalát Bek,\"\r\ncried Djemboulat, with fury, rushing into the combat which was to be\r\nhis last--\"Forward! for us death is liberty.\" But Anmalát heard not\r\nhis call; a blow from a musket on the back of the head stretched him\r\non the earth, already sown with corpses, and covered with blood.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: \"Hurrah\" means _strike_ in the Tartar language.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER. V.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM COLONEL VERHOFFSKY TO HIS BETROTHED.\r\n\r\n  _From Derbénd to Smolénsk. October_, 1819.\r\n\r\nTwo months--how easy to say it!--two centuries have past, dearest\r\nMaria, while your letter was _creeping_ to me. Twice has the moon\r\nmade her journey round the earth. You cannot imagine, dearest, how\r\ndreary is this idle objectless life to me; with nothing to employ\r\nme--not even correspondence. I go out, I meet the _Kazák_ [26]\r\nwith a secret trembling of heart: with what joy, with what exstacy\r\ndo I kiss the lines traced by a pure hand, inspired by a pure\r\nheart--yours, my Maria! With a greedy rapture my eyes devour the\r\nletter: then I am happy--I am wild with joy. But hardly have I\r\nreclosed it when unquiet thoughts again begin to haunt me. \"All this\r\nis well,\" I think; \"but all this is past, and I desire to know the\r\npresent. Is she well? Does she love me yet? Oh! will the happy time\r\ncome soon--soon--when neither time nor distance can divide us? When\r\nthe expression of our love will be no longer chilled by the cold\r\nmedium of the post!\" Pardon, pardon, dearest, these black thoughts\r\nof absence. When heart is--with heart, the lover trusts in all; in\r\nseparation he doubts all. You command--for such to me is your\r\nwish--that I should describe my life to you, day by day, hour by hour.\r\nOh, what sad and tiresome annals mine would be, were I to obey you!\r\nYou know well, traitress, that I live not without you. My\r\nexistence--'tis but the trace of a shadow on the desert sand. My duty\r\nalone, which wearies at least, if it cannot amuse me, helps me to\r\nget rid of the time. Thrown in a climate ruinous to health, in\r\nsociety which stifles the soul, I cannot find among my companions a\r\nsingle person who can sympathise with me. Nor do I find among the\r\nAsiatics any who can understand my thoughts. All that surrounds me\r\nis either so savage or so limited, that it excites sadness and\r\ndiscontent. Sooner will you obtain fire by striking ice on stone,\r\nthan interest from such an existence. But your wish to me is sacred;\r\nand I will present you, in brief, with my last week. It was more\r\nvaried than usual.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: The Kazáks are employed in the Russian army\r\nfrequently as couriers.]\r\n\r\nI have told you in one of my letters, if I remember, that we are\r\nreturning from the campaign of Akoúsh, with the commander-in-chief.\r\nWe have done our work; Shah Ali Khan has fled into Persia; we have\r\nburned a number of villages, hay, and corn; and we have eaten the\r\nsheep of the rebels, when we were hungry. When the snow had driven\r\nthe insurgents from their mountain-fastnesses, they yielded and\r\npresented hostages. We then marched to the Fort of Boúrnaya, [27]\r\nand from this station our detachment was ordered into winter\r\nquarters. Of this division my regiment forms a part, and our\r\nhead-quarters are at Derbénd.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Stormy.]\r\n\r\nThe other day, the general, who was about to depart on another\r\ncampaign on the Line, came to take leave of us, and thus there\r\nwas a larger company than usual to meet our adored commander.\r\nAlexéi Petróvitch came from his tent, to join us at tea. Who\r\nis not acquainted with his face, from the portraits? But they\r\ncannot be said to know Yermóloff at all, who judge of him only by\r\na lifeless image. Never was there a face gifted with such nobility\r\nof expression as his! Gazing on those features, chiselled in the\r\nnoble outline of the antique, you are involuntarily carried back to\r\nthe times of Roman grandeur. The poet was in the right, when he said\r\nof him:--\r\n\r\n  \"On the Koubán--fly, Tartar fleet!\r\n  The avenger's falchion gleameth;\r\n  His breath--the grapeshot's iron sleet,\r\n  His voice--the thunder seemeth!\r\n  Around his forehead stern and pale\r\n  The fates of war are playing....\r\n  He looks--and victory doth quail,\r\n  That gesture proud obeying!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou should witness his coolness in the hour of battle--you should\r\nadmire him at a conference: at one time overwhelming the Teberkéss\r\nwith the flowing orientalisms of the Asiatic, at another\r\nembarrassing their artifices with a single remark. In vain do they\r\nconceal their thoughts in the most secret folds of their hearts; his\r\neye follows them, disentangles and unrolls them like worms, and\r\nguesses twenty years beforehand their deeds and their intentions.\r\nThen, again, to see him talking frankly and like a friend with his\r\nbrave soldiers, or passing with dignity round the circle of the\r\ntchinóbniks [28] sent from the capital into Georgia. It is curious to\r\nobserve how all those whose conscience is not pure, tremble, blush,\r\nturn pale, when he fixes on them his slow and penetrating glance; you\r\nseem to see the roubles of past bribes gliding before the eyes of the\r\nguilty man, and his villanies come rushing on his memory. You see the\r\npictures of arrest, trial, judgment, sentence, and punishment, his\r\nimagination paints, anticipating the future. No man knows so well\r\nhow to distinguish merit by a single glance, a single smile--to\r\nreward gallantry with a word, coming _from_, and going _to_, the\r\nheart. God grant us many years to serve with such a commander!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Literally, a person possessing rank, used here to\r\nsignify an _employé_ of Government in a civil capacity--all of whom\r\npossess some definite precedence or class (tchin) in the state. ]\r\n\r\nBut if it be thus interesting to observe him on duty, how delightful\r\nto associate with him in society--a society to which every one\r\ndistinguished for rank, bravery, or intellect, has free access:\r\n_here_ rank is forgotten, formality is banished; every one talks\r\nand acts as he pleases, simply because those only who think and act\r\nas they _ought_, form the society. Alexéi Petróvitch jokes with all\r\nlike a comrade, and at the same time teaches like a father. As usual,\r\nduring tea, one of his adjutants read aloud; it was the account of\r\nNapoleon's Campaign in Italy--that poem of the Art of War, as the\r\ncommander-in-chief called it. The company, of course, expressed\r\ntheir wonder, their admiration, their different opinions and\r\ncriticisms. The remarks of Alexéi Petróvitch were lucid, and of\r\nadmirable truth.\r\n\r\nThen began our gymnastic sports, leaping, running, leaping over the\r\nfire, and trials of strength of various kinds. The evening and the\r\nview were both magnificent: the camp was pitched on the side of Tarki;\r\nover it hangs the fortress of Boúrnaya, behind which the sun was\r\nsinking. Sheltered by a cliff was the house of the Shamkhál, then\r\nthe town on a steep declivity, surrounded by the camp, and to the\r\neast the immeasurable steppe of the Caspian sea. Tartar Beks,\r\nCircassian Princes, Kazáks from the various rivers of gigantic Russia,\r\nhostages from different mountains, mingled with the officers.\r\nUniforms, tchoukhás, coats of chain-mail, were picturesquely mingled;\r\nsinging and music rang through the camp, and the soldiers, with\r\ntheir caps jauntily cocked on one side, were walking in crowds at a\r\ndistance. The scene was delightful; it charmed by its picturesque\r\nvariety and the force and freshness of military life. Captain Bekóvitch\r\nwas boasting that he could strike off the head of a buffalo with one\r\nblow of a kinjál; [29] and two of those clumsy animals were immediately\r\nbrought.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: It is absurd to observe the incredulity\r\nof Europeans as to the possibility of cutting off a head with the\r\nkinjál: it is necessary to live only one week in the East to be quite\r\nconvinced of the possibility of the feat. In a practiced hand the\r\nkinjál is a substitute for the hatchet, the bayonet, and the sabre.]\r\n\r\nBets were laid; all were disputing and doubting. The Captain, with a\r\nsmile, seized with his left hand a huge dagger, and in an instant an\r\nimmense head fell at the feet of the astonished spectators, whose\r\nsurprise was instantly succeeded by a desire to do the same: they\r\nhacked and hewed, but all in vain. Many of the strongest men among\r\nthe Russians and Asiatics made unsuccessful attempts to perform the\r\nfeat, but to do this strength alone was not sufficient. \"You are\r\nchildren--children!\" cried the commander-in-chief: and he rose from\r\ntable, calling for his sword--a blade which never struck twice, as he\r\ntold us. An immense heavy sabre was brought him, and Alexéi Petróvitch,\r\nthough confident in his strength, yet, like Ulysses in the Odyssey,\r\nanointing the bow which no one else could bend, first felt the edge,\r\nwaved the weapon thrice in the air, and at length addressed himself\r\nto the feat. The betters had hardly time to strike hands when the\r\nbuffalo's head bounded at their feet on the earth. So swift and sure\r\nwas the blow, that the trunk stood for some instants on its legs,\r\nand then gently, softly, sank down. A cry of astonishment arose from\r\nall: Alexéi Petróvitch quietly looked whether his sabre was notched--for\r\nthe weapon had cost him many thousands [of roubles], and presented\r\nit as a keepsake to Captain Bekóvitch.\r\n\r\nWe were still whispering among ourselves when there appeared before\r\nthe commander-in-chief an officer of the Kazáks of the Line, with a\r\nmessage from Colonel Kortsáreff, who was stationed on the frontier.\r\nWhen he had received the report, the countenance of Alexéi Petróvitch\r\nbrightenened--\"Kortsáreff has gloriously trounced the mountaineers!\"\r\nsaid he. \"These rascals have made a plundering expedition beyond the\r\nTérek; they have passed far within the Line, and have plundered a\r\nvillage--but they have lost not only the cattle they had taken, but\r\nfallen a sacrifice to their own fool-hardiness.\" Having minutely\r\nquestioned Yesoúal respecting the details of the affair, he ordered\r\nthe prisoners whom they had taken, wounded or recovering, to be\r\nbrought before him. Five were led into the presence of the\r\ncommander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nA cloud passed over his countenance as he beheld them; his brow\r\ncontracted, his eyes sparkled. \"Villains!\" said he to the Ouzdéns;\r\n\"you have thrice sworn not to plunder; and thrice have you broken\r\nyour oath. What is it that you seek? Lands? Flocks? Means to defend\r\nthe one or the other? But no! you are willing to accept presents\r\nfrom the Russians as allies, and at the same time to guide the\r\nTcherkéss to plunder our villages, and to plunder along with them.\r\nHang them!\" said he sternly; \"hang them up by their own thievish arkáus\r\n(girdles)! Let them draw lots: the fourth shall be spared--let him\r\ngo and tell his countrymen that I am coming to teach them to keep\r\nfaith, and keep the peace, as I will have it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ouzdéns were conducted away.\r\n\r\nThere remained one Tartar bek, whom we had not remarked. This was a\r\nyoung man of twenty-five, of unusual beauty, graceful as the\r\nBelvidere Apollo. He bowed slightly to the commander-in chief as he\r\napproached him, raised his cap, and again resumed his proud\r\nindifferent expression; unshaken resignation to his fate was written\r\non his features.\r\n\r\nThe commander-in-chief fixed his stern eye upon his face, but the\r\nyoung man neither changed countenance nor quivered an eyelash.\r\n\r\n\"Ammalát Bek,\" said Alexéi Petróvitch, after a pause, \"do you\r\nremember that you are a Russian subject? that the Russian laws are\r\nabove you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would have been impossible to forget that,\" replied the Bek:\r\n\"if I had found in those laws a protection for my rights, I should\r\nnot now stand before you a prisoner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ungrateful boy!\" cried the commander-in-chief; \"your father--you\r\nyourself, have been the enemy of the Russians. Had it been during the\r\nPersian domination of your race, not even the ashes would have\r\nremained; but our Emperor was generous, and instead of punishing you\r\nhe gave you lands. And how did you repay his kindness? By secret\r\nplot and open revolt! This is not all: you received and sheltered in\r\nyour house a sworn foe to Russia; you permitted him, before your eyes,\r\ntraitorously to slaughter a Russian officer. In spite of all this,\r\nhad you brought me a submissive head, I would have pardoned you, on\r\naccount of your youth and the customs of your nation. But you fled\r\nto the mountains, and with Suleiman Akhmet Khan you committed\r\nviolence within the Russian bounds; you were beaten, and again you\r\nmake an incursion with Djemboulát. You cannot but know what fate\r\nawaits you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" coldly answered Ammalát Bek: \"I shall be shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! a bullet is too honourable a death for a brigand,\" cried the\r\nangry general: \"a cart with the shafts turned up--a cord round your\r\nneck--that is the fitting reward.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is all one how a man dies,\" replied Ammalát, \"provided he dies\r\nspeedily. I ask one favour: do not let me be tormented with a trial:\r\nthat is thrice death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou deservest a hundred deaths, audacious! but I promise you. Be it\r\nso: to-morrow thou shalt die. Assemble a court-martial,\" continued\r\nthe commander-in-chief, turning to his staff: \"the fact is clear,\r\nthe proof is before your eyes, and let all be finished at one sitting,\r\nbefore my departure.\"\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand, and the condemned prisoner was removed.\r\n\r\nThe fate of this fine young man touched us all. Every body was\r\nwhispering about him; every body pitying him; the more, that\r\nthere appeared no means of saving him. Every one knew well the\r\nnecessity of punishing this double treason, and the inflexibility\r\nof Alexéi Petróvitch in matters of this publicity: and, therefore,\r\nno one dared to intercede for the unfortunate culprit. The\r\ncommander-in-chief was unusually thoughtful for the remainder of the\r\nevening, and the party separated early. I determined to speak a word\r\nfor him--\"Perhaps,\" I thought, \"I may obtain some commutation of the\r\nsentence.\" I opened one of the curtains of the tent, and advanced\r\nsoftly into the presence of Alexéi Petróvitch. He was sitting alone,\r\nresting both arms on a table; before him lay a despatch for the\r\nEmperor, half finished, and which he was writing without any previous\r\ncopy. Alexéi Petróvitch knew me as an officer of the suite, and we\r\nhad been acquainted since the battle of Kulm. At that time he had\r\nbeen very kind to me, and therefore my visit was not surprising to\r\nhim. \"I see--I see, Evstáfii Ivánovitch, you have a design upon my\r\nheart! In general you come in as if you were marching up to a battery,\r\nbut now you hardly walk on tip-toe. This is not for nothing. I am\r\nsure you are come with a request about Ammalát.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have guessed it,\" said I to Alexéi Petróvitch, not knowing how\r\nto begin.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, then, and let us talk it over,\" he replied. Then, after a\r\nsilence of a couple of minutes, he continued, kindly, \"I know that a\r\nreport goes about respecting me, that I treat the lives of men as a\r\nplaything--their blood as water. The most cruel tyrants have hidden\r\ntheir bloodthirstiness under a mask of benevolence. They feared a\r\nreputation for cruelty, though they feared not to commit deeds of\r\ncruelty; but I--I have intentionally clothed myself with this sort\r\nof character, and purposely dressed my name in terror. I desire, and\r\nit is my duty to desire, that my name should protect our frontier\r\nmore effectually than lines and fortresses--that a single word of\r\nmine should be, to the Asiatics, more certain, more inevitable, than\r\ndeath. The European may be reasoned with: he is influenced by\r\nconscience, touched by kindness, attached by pardon, won by\r\nbenefits; but to the Asiatic all this is an infallible proof of\r\nweakness; and to him I--even from motives of philanthropy--have\r\nshown myself unmitigably severe. A single execution preserves a\r\nhundred Russians from destruction, and deters a thousand Mussulmans\r\nfrom treason. Evstáfii Ivánovitch, many will not believe my words,\r\nbecause each conceals the cruelty of his nature, and his secret\r\nrevengefulness, under excuses of necessity--each says, with a\r\npretence of feeling, 'Really I wish from my heart to pardon,\r\nbut be judges yourselves--can I? What, after this, are laws--what\r\nis the general welfare?' All this I never say; in my eyes no tear\r\nis seen when I sign a sentence of death: but my heart bleeds.\"\r\n\r\nAlexéi Petróvitch was touched; he walked agitatedly several times up\r\nand down the tent; then seated himself, and continued--\"Never, in\r\nspite of all this, never has it been so difficult to me to punish as\r\nthis day. He who, like me, has lived much among the Asiatics, ceases\r\nto trust in Lavater, and places no more confidence in a handsome\r\nface than in a letter of recommendation; but the look, the expression,\r\nthe demeanour of this Ammalát, have produced on me an unusual\r\nimpression. I am sorry for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"A generous heart,\" said I, \"is a better oracle than reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"The heart of a conscientious man, my dear friend, ought to be under\r\nthe command of reason. I certainly _can_ pardon Ammalát, but I\r\n_ought_ to punish him. Daghestán is still filled with the enemies\r\nof Russia, notwithstanding their assurances of submission; even\r\nTarki is ready to revolt at the first movement in the mountains: we\r\nmust rivet their chains by punishment, and show the Tartars that no\r\nbirth can screen the guilty--that all are equal in the sight of the\r\nRussian law. If I pardon Ammalát, all his relations will begin to\r\nboast that Yermóloff is afraid of the Shamkhál.\" I remarked, that\r\nindulgence shown to so extensive a clan would have a good effect on\r\nthe country--in particular the Shamkhál.\r\n\r\n\"The Shamkhal is an Asiatic,\" interrupted Alexéi Petróvitch;\r\n\"he would be delighted that this heir to the Shamkhalát should be\r\nsent to the Elysian fields. Besides, I care very little to guess or\r\ngratify the wishes of his kinsmen.\"\r\n\r\nI saw that the commander-in-chief began to waver, and I urged him\r\nmore pressingly. \"Let me serve for three years,\" said I; \"do not\r\ngive me leave of absence this year--only have mercy on this young man.\r\nHe is young, and Russia may find in him a faithful servant.\r\nGenerosity is never thrown away.\"\r\n\r\nAlexéi Petróvitch shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"I have made many ungrateful,\" said he, \"already; but be it so. I\r\npardon him, and not by halves--that is not my way. I thank you for\r\nhaving helped me to be merciful, not to say weak. Only remember my\r\nwords: You wish to take him to yourself--do not trust him; do not\r\nwarm a serpent in your bosom.\"\r\n\r\nI was so delighted with my success, that, hastily quitting the\r\ncommander-in-chief, I ran to the tent in which Ammalát Bek was\r\nconfined. Three sentinels were guarding him; a lantern was burning\r\nin the midst. I entered; the prisoner was lying wrapped up in his\r\nboúrka, and tears were sparkling on his face. He did not hear my\r\nentrance, so profoundly was he buried in thought. To whom is it\r\npleasant to part with life? I was rejoiced that I brought comfort to\r\nhim at so melancholy a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Ammalát,\" said I, \"Allah is great, and the Sardár is merciful; he\r\nhas granted you your life!\"\r\n\r\nThe delighted prisoner started up, and endeavoured to reply, but the\r\nbreath was stifled in his breast. Immediately, however, a shade of\r\ngloom covered his features. \"Life!\" he exclaimed; \"I understand this\r\ngenerosity! To consign a man to a breathless dungeon, without light\r\nor air--to send him to eternal winter, to a night never illumined by\r\na star--to bury him alive in the bowels of the earth--to take from\r\nhim not only the power to act, not only the means of life, but even\r\nthe privilege of telling his kinsmen of his sad lot--to deny him not\r\nonly the right to complain, but even the power of murmuring his\r\nsorrow to the wind. And this you call life! this unceasing torment\r\nyou boast of as rare generosity! Tell the General that I want\r\nnot--that I scorn--such a life.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mistaken, Ammalát,\" I cried; \"you are fully pardoned: remain\r\nwhat you were, the master of your actions and possessions. There is\r\nyour sword. The commander-in-chief is sure that in future you will\r\nunsheathe it only for the Russians. I offer you one condition; come\r\nand live with me till the report of your actions has died away. You\r\nshall be to be as a friend, as a brother.\"\r\n\r\nThis struck the Asiatic. Tears shone in his eyes. \"The Russians have\r\nconquered me,\" he said: \"pardon me, colonel, that I thought ill of\r\nall of you. From henceforth I am a faithful servant of the Russian\r\nTsar--a faithful friend to the Russians, soul and sword. My sword,\r\nmy sword!\" he cried, gazing fixedly on his costly blade; \"let these\r\ntears wash from thee the Russian blood and the Tartar _naphtha_! [30]\r\nWhen and how can I reward you, with my service, for liberty and life?\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: The Tartars, to preserve their weapons, and to produce a\r\nblack colour on them, smoke the metal, and then rub it with naphtha.]\r\n\r\nI am sure, my dear Maria, that you will keep me, for this, one\r\nof your sweetest kisses. Ever, ever, when feeling or acting\r\ngenerously, I console myself with the thought, \"My Maria will\r\npraise me for this!\" But when is this to happen, my darling?\r\nFate is but a stepmother to us. Your mourning is prolonged, and\r\nthe commander-in-chief has decidedly refused me leave of absence;\r\nnor am I much displeased, annoying as it is: my regiment is in\r\na bad state of discipline--indeed, as bad as can be imagined;\r\nbesides, I am charged with the construction of new barracks and\r\nthe colonization of a married company. If I were absent for a month,\r\nevery thing would go wrong. If I remain, what a sacrifice of my heart!\r\n\r\nHere we have been at Derbénd three days. Ammalát lives with me: he\r\nis silent, sad, and savage; but his fear is interesting, nevertheless.\r\nHe speaks Russian very well, and I have commenced teaching him to read\r\nand write. His intelligence is unusually great. In time, I hope to\r\nmake him a most charming Tartar. (_The conclusion of the letter has\r\nno reference to our story_.)\r\n\r\nFragment of another letter from Colonel Verhóffsky to his _fiancée_,\r\nwritten six months after the preceding.\r\n\r\nFrom Derbénd to Smolénsk.\r\n\r\nYour favourite Ammalát, my dearest Maria, will soon be quite\r\nRussianized. The Tartar Beks, in general, think the first step of\r\ncivilization consists in the use of the unlawful wine and pork. I,\r\non the contrary, have begun by re-educating the mind of Ammalát. I\r\nshow him, I prove to him, what is bad in the customs of his nation,\r\nand what is good in those of ours; I explain to him universal and\r\neternal truths. I read with him, I accustom him to write, and I\r\nremark with pleasure that he takes the deepest interest in\r\ncomposition. I may say, indeed, that he is passionately fond of it;\r\nfor with him every wish, every desire, every caprice, is a\r\npassion--an ardent and impatient passion. It is difficult for a\r\nEuropean to imagine, and still more difficult to understand, the\r\ninflammability of the unruly, or rather unbridled, passions of an\r\nAsiatic, with whom the will alone has been, since childhood, the\r\nonly limit to his desires. Our passions are like domestic animals; or,\r\nif they are wild beasts, they are tamed, and taught to dance upon\r\nthe rope of the \"conveniences,\" with a ring through their nostrils\r\nand their claws cut: in the East they are free as the lion and the\r\ntiger.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe, on the countenance of Ammalát, the blush\r\nwith which his features are covered at the least contradiction; the\r\nfire with which he is filled at any dispute; but as soon as he finds\r\nthat he is in the wrong, he turns pale, and seems ready to weep.\r\n\"I am in the wrong,\" says he; \"pardon me: takhsirumdam ghitch,\r\n(blot out my fault;) forget that I am wrong, and that you have\r\npardoned me.\" He has a good heart, but a heart always ready to be\r\nset on fire, either by a ray of the sun or by a spark of hell.\r\nNature has gifted him with all that is necessary to render him a man,\r\nas well in his moral as physical constitution; but national\r\nprejudices, and the want of education, have done all that is\r\npossible to disfigure and to corrupt these natural qualities. His\r\nmind is a mixture of all sorts of inconsistencies, of the most\r\nabsurd ideas, and of the soundest thoughts: sometimes he seizes\r\ninstantly abstract propositions when they are presented to him in a\r\nsimple form, and again he will obstinately oppose the plainest and\r\nmost evident truths: because the former are quite new to him, and\r\nthe latter are obscured by previous prejudices and impressions. I\r\nbegin to fancy that it is easier to build a new edifice than to\r\nreconstruct an old one.\r\n\r\nBut how happens it that Ammalát is melancholy and absent? He makes\r\ngreat progress in every thing that does not require an attentive and\r\ncontinuous reflection, and a gradual development; but when the\r\nmatter involves remote consequences, his mind resembles a short\r\nfire-arm, which sends its charge quickly, direct, and strongly, but\r\nnot to any distance. Is this a defect of his mind? or is it that his\r\nattention is entirely occupied with something else? ... For a man of\r\ntwenty-three, however, it is easy to imagine the cause. Sometimes he\r\nappears to be listening attentively to what I am telling him; but\r\nwhen I ask for his answer, he seems all abroad. Sometimes I find the\r\ntears flowing from his eyes: I address him--he neither hears nor\r\nsees me. Last night he was restless in his sleep, and I heard the\r\nword \"seltanét--seltanét,\" (power, power,) frequently escape him. Is\r\nit possible that the love of power can so torment a young heart? No,\r\nno! another passion agitates, troubles the soul of Ammalát. Is it\r\nfor me to doubt of the symptoms of love's divine disease? He is in\r\nlove--he is passionately in love; but with whom? Oh, I will know!\r\nFriendship is as curious as a woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOCCUPATION OF ADEN.\r\n\r\n\"It is only by a naval power,\" says Gibbon, \"that the reduction of\r\nYemen can be successfully attempted\"--a remark, by the way, which\r\nmore than one of the ancients had made before him. All the\r\ncomparatively fertile districts in the south of Arabia, in fact, are\r\neven more completely insulated by the deserts and barren mountains of\r\nthe interior on one side, than by the sea on the other--inasmuch as\r\neasier access would be gained by an invader, even by the dangerous\r\nand difficult navigation of the Red Sea, than by a march through a\r\nregion where the means of subsistence do not exist, and where the\r\nBedoweens, by choking or concealing the wells, might in a moment cut\r\noff even the scanty supply of water which the country affords. This\r\nmode of passive resistance was well understood and practised by them\r\nas early as the time of Ælius Gallus, the first Roman general who\r\nconceived the hope of rifling the virgin treasures popularly\r\nbelieved to be buried in the inaccessible hoards of the princes of\r\nArabia, whose realms were long looked upon--perhaps on the principle\r\nof _omne ignotum pro magnifico_--as a sort of indefinite and\r\nmysterious El Dorado. [31]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: \"Intactis opulentior thesauris Arabum.\"\r\n--_Horat. Od_. iii. 24. Pliny (_Hist. Nat_. vi. 32) more soberly\r\nendeavours to prove the enormous accumulation of wealth which must\r\nhave taken place in Arabia, from the constant influx of the precious\r\nmetals for the purchase of their spices and other commodities, while\r\nthey bought none of the productions of other countries in return.]\r\n\r\nThese golden dreams speedily vanished as the country became more\r\nextensively known: and though the Arab tribes of the desert between\r\nSyria and the Euphrates acknowledged a nominal subjection to Rome,\r\nthe intercourse of the Imperial City with Yemen, or Arabia Felix,\r\nwas confined to the trade which was carried on over the Red Sea from\r\nEgypt, and which became the channel through which not only the\r\nspices of Arabia, but the rich products of India, and even the slaves\r\n[32] and ivory of Eastern Africa, were supplied to the markets of\r\nItaly. At the present day, almost the whole of the south coast of\r\nArabia fronting the Indian Ocean, nearly from the head of the Persian\r\nGulf to the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, as well as the eastern coast of\r\nAfrica, from Cape Guardafui to the entrance of the Mozambique Channel\r\na seaboard approaching 4000 miles in length--is more or less subject\r\nto the Sultan of Muscat, [33] a prince whose power is almost wholly\r\nmaritime, and whose dominions nowhere extend more than thirty or forty\r\nmiles inland: while our own recent acquisition of Aden, a detached point\r\nwith which our communication can be maintained only by restraining\r\nthe command of the sea, has for the first time given an European\r\npower (excepting the Turks, whose possessions in Arabia always\r\ndepended on Egypt) a _locus standi_ on the shores of Yemen.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: This part of Africa is noticed by Arrian as famous for\r\nthe excellent quality of the slaves brought from [Greek: ta doulicha\r\nchreissota],and it still retains its pre-eminence. The tribes in\r\nthis quarter are far superior both in personal appearance and\r\nintellect to the negroes of Guinea.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: We have seen it somewhere stated that the Sultan has\r\nalso attempted, by means of his navy, to exercise authority on the\r\nshores of Beloochistan; which would bring him into contact with our\r\nown outposts at Soumeeani, &c., near the mouth of the Indus.]\r\n\r\nThe process by which we obtained this footing in Arabia was strictly\r\nin accordance with the maxims of policy adopted by the then rulers\r\nof British India, and which they were at the same time engaged in\r\ncarrying out, on a far more extended scale, in Affghanistan. In both\r\ncases--perhaps from a benevolent anxiety to accommodate our\r\ndiplomacy to the primitive ideas of those with whom we had to deal--\r\n\r\n  \"the good old rule\r\n  Sufficeth them, the simple plan\r\n  That they should take who have the power,\r\n  And they should keep who can\"--\r\n\r\nwas assumed as the basis of our proceedings: and though the brilliant\r\nsuccess which for a time attended our philanthropic exertions in the\r\ncause of good order and civilization beyond the Indus, so completely\r\nthrew into the shade the minor glories of Aden, that this latter\r\nachievement attracted scarcely any public attention at the time of\r\nits occurrence, its merits are quite sufficient to entitle it to a\r\nmore detailed notice than it has hitherto received in the pages of\r\nMaga. Nor can a more opportune juncture be found than the present,\r\nwhen the late events in Cabul have apparently had a marvellous\r\neffect in opening the eyes of our statesmen, both in India and\r\nEngland, to the moral and political delinquency of the system we\r\nhave so long pursued--of taking the previous owner's consent for\r\ngranted, whenever it suited our views to possess ourselves of a\r\nfortress, island, or tract of territory, belonging to any nation not\r\nsufficiently civilized to have had representatives at the Congress\r\nof Vienna. Whether our repentance is to be carried the length of\r\nuniversal restitution, remains to be seen; if so, it is to be hoped\r\nthat the circumstances of the capture of Aden will be duly borne in\r\nmind. But before we proceed to detail the steps by which the British\r\ncolours came to be hoisted at this remote angle of Arabia, it will\r\nbe well to give some account of the place itself and its previous\r\nhistory; since we suspect that the majority of newspaper politicians,\r\nunless the intelligence of its capture chanced to catch their eye in\r\nthe columns of the _Times_, are to this day ignorant that such a\r\nfortress is numbered among the possessions of the British crown.\r\n\r\nThe harbour of Aden, then, lies on the south coast of Yemen, as\r\nnearly as possible in 12º 45' N. latitude, and 45º 10' E. longitude;\r\nsomewhat more than 100 miles east of Cape Bab-el-Mandeb, at the\r\nentrance of the Red Sea; and about 150 miles by sea, or 120 by land,\r\nfrom Mokha, [34] the nearest port within the Straits. The town was built\r\non the eastern side of a high rocky peninsula, about four miles in\r\nlength from E. to W., by two miles and a half N. and S.--which was\r\nprobably, at no very remote period, an island, but is now joined to\r\nthe mainland by a long low sandy isthmus, [35]  on each side of which,\r\nto the east and west, a harbour is formed between the peninsula and\r\nthe mainland. The East Bay, immediately opposite the town, though\r\nof comparatively small extent, is protected by the rocky islet of\r\nSeerah, rising seaward to the height of from 400 to 600 feet, and\r\naffords excellent anchorage at all times, except during the north-east\r\nmonsoon: but the Western or Black Bay, completely landlocked and\r\nsheltered in great part of its extent by the high ground of its\r\npeninsula, (which rises to an elevation of nearly 1800 feet,) runs up\r\ninland a distance of seven miles from the headland of Jibel-Hassan,\r\n(which protects its mouth on the west,) to the junction of the isthmus\r\nwith the main, and presents at all times a secure and magnificent\r\nharbour, four miles wide at the entrance, and perfectly free from\r\nrocks, shoals, and all impediments to ingress or egress. Such are the\r\nnatural advantages of Aden: and \"whoever\"--says Wellsted--\"might have\r\nbeen the founder, the site was happily selected, and well calculated\r\nby its imposing appearance not only to display the splendour of its\r\nedifices, but also, uniting strength with ornament, to sustain the\r\ncharacter which it subsequently bore, as the port and bulwark of\r\nArabia Felix.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: This isthmus is said by Lieutenant Wellsted to be \"about\r\n200 yards in breadth:\" perhaps a misprint for 1200, as a writer in the\r\n_United Service Journal_, May 1840, calls it 1350 yards; and,\r\naccording to the plan in the papers laid before Parliament, it would\r\nappear to be rather more than half a mile at the narrowest part, where\r\nit is crossed by the Turkish wall.]\r\n\r\nFrom the almost impregnable strength of its situation, and the\r\nexcellence of its harbour, which affords almost the only secure\r\nshelter for shipping near the junction of the Red Sea and the Indian\r\nOcean, Aden has been, both in ancient and modern times, a place of\r\nnote and importance as a central point for the commerce carried on\r\nwith the East by way of Egypt. It was known to the ancients as the\r\nArabian emporium, and Abulfeda, in the fourteenth century, describes\r\nit, in his Geography, as \"a city on the sea-shore, within the\r\ndistrict of Abiyan; with a safe and capacious port, much frequented\r\nby ships from India and China, and by merchants and men of\r\nwealth, not only from those countries, but from Abyssinia, the\r\nHedjaz, &c.;\" adding, however, \"that it is dry and burnt up by the\r\nsun, and so totally destitute of pasture and water, that one of the\r\ngates is named Bab-el-Sakiyyin, or _Gate of the Water-carriers_,\r\nfor fresh water must be brought from a distance.\" In somewhat\r\nlater times, when the Portuguese began to effect settlements on the\r\ncoasts of Guzerat and Malabar, and to attack the Mohammedan commerce\r\nin the Indian Seas, the port of Aden (when, with the rest of Yemen,\r\nthen paid a nominal allegiance to the Egyptian monarchy) became the\r\nprincipal rendezvous for the armaments equipped by the Circassian\r\nSultans of Cairo in the Red Sea, in aid of their Moslem brethren,\r\nthen oppressed by those whom the Sheikh Zein-ed-deen emphatically\r\ndenounces as \"a race of unclean Frank interlopers--may the curse of\r\nAllah rest upon them and all infidels!\" It was, in consequence, more\r\nthan once attacked by the famous Alboquerque, (who, in 1513, lost\r\n2000 men before it,) and his successor Lope Soarez, but the\r\nPortuguese never succeeded in occupying it; and the Mamluke empire\r\nwas overthrown, in 1517, by the arms of the Ottoman Sultan, Selim I.\r\nThe new masters of Egypt, however, speedily adopted the policy of\r\nthe rulers whom they had supplanted; and not contented with the\r\nlimited _suzerainté_ over the Arab chiefs of Yemen, exercised by the\r\nCircassian monarchs, determined on bringing that country under the\r\ndirect control of the Porte, as a _point d'appui_ for the operations\r\nto be undertaken in the Indian Ocean. With this view, the eunuch,\r\nSoliman-Pasha, who was sent in command of a formidible squadron from\r\nSuez, in 1538, to attempt the recapture of Dui, [36] in Guzerat, from\r\nthe Portuguese, received instructions to make himself in the first place\r\nmaster of Aden, to the possession of which the Turks might reasonable\r\nlay claim as a dependency of their newly-acquired realm of Egypt; the\r\nseizure, however, was effected by means of base treachery. The prince,\r\nSheikh-Amer, of the race of the Beni-Teher, was summoned on board\r\nthe admiral's galley, and accepted the invitation without suspicion;\r\nbut he was instantly placed in confinement, and shortly afterwards\r\npublicly hanged at the yard-arm; while the Pasha, landing his troops,\r\ntook possession of Aden in the name of Soliman the Magnificent. It\r\nwas not, however, till 1568, that the final reduction of Yemen was\r\naccomplished, when Aden and other towns, which had fallen into the\r\nhands of an Arab chief named Moutaher, were recaptured by a powerful\r\narmy sent from Egypt; the whole province was formally divided into\r\nsandjaks or districts, and the seat of the beglerbeg, or supreme\r\npasha, fixed at Sana.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: The warfare of the Ottomans in India is a curious\r\nepisode in their history, which has attracted but little notice from\r\nEuropean writers. The Soliman-Pasha above mentioned (called by\r\nthe Indian historians Soliman-Khan _Roomi_, or the Turk, and by the\r\nPortuguese Solimanus Peloponnesiacus) bore a distinguished part\r\nin those affairs; but this expedition against Diu was the last in\r\nwhich he was engaged. The kingdom of Guzerat was, at that time, in\r\ngreat confusion after the death of its king, Bahadur Shah, who had\r\nbeen treacherously killed in an affray with the Portuguese in 1536;\r\nand it would appear probable that the Turks, if they had succeeded\r\nagainst Diu, meditated taking possession of the country.]\r\n\r\nThe domination of the Turks in Yemen did not continue much more than\r\nsixty years after this latter epoch; the constant revolts of the\r\nArab tribes, and the feuds of the Turkish military chiefs, whose\r\ndistance from the seat of government placed them beyond the control\r\nof the Porte, combined in rendering it an unprofitable possession.\r\nThe Indian trade, moreover, was permanently diverted to the route by\r\nthe Cape; and any political schemes which the Porte might at one time\r\nhave entertained in regard to India, had been extinguished by the\r\nreunion, under the Mogul sway, of the various shattered sovereignties\r\nof Hindostan. In 1633, [37] the Turkish troops were finally withdrawn\r\nfrom the province, which then fell under the rule of the still existing\r\ndynasty of the Imams of Sana, who claim descent from Mohammed. But the\r\nruins even now remaining of the fortifications and publick works\r\nconstructed in Aden by the Ottomans during their tenure of the place,\r\nare on a scale which not only proves how fully they were aware of the\r\nimportance of the position, but gives a high idea of the energy with\r\nwhich their resources were administered during the palmy days of their\r\npower, when such vast labour and outlay were expended on the security\r\nof an isolated stronghold at the furthest extremity of their empire.\r\nThe defences of the town, even in their present state, are the most\r\nstriking evidence now existing of the science and skill of the Turkish\r\nengineers in former times; and, when they were entire, Aden must have\r\nbeen another Gibraltar. \"The lines taken for the works,\" says a late\r\nobserver, \"evince great judgment, a good flanking fire being every\r\nwhere obtained; no one place which could possibly admit of being\r\nfortified has been omitted, and we could not do better than tread in\r\nthe steps of our predecessors. The profile is tremendous.\" A supply\r\nof water (of which the peninsula had been wholly destitute) was\r\nsecured, not only by constructing numerous tanks within the walls,\r\nand by boring numerous wells through the solid rock to a depth of\r\nupwards of 200 feet, [38] but by carrying an aqueduct into the\r\ntown from a spring eight miles in the country, the reservoir at the\r\nend of which was defended by a redoubt mounted with artillery. The\r\noutposts were not less carefully strengthened than the body of the\r\nplace--a rampart with bastions (called, in the reports of the\r\ngarrison, _the Turkish Wall_) was carried along some high ground on\r\nthe isthmus from sea to sea, to guard against an attack on the land\r\nside--the lofty rocky islet of Seerah, immediately off the town, was\r\ncovered with watchtowers and batteries--and several of those\r\nenormous guns, with the effect of which the English became\r\npractically acquainted at the passage of the Dardanelles in 1807,\r\nwere mounted on the summit of the precipices, to command the seaward\r\napproach; and, when Lieutenant Wellsted was at Aden, those huge\r\npieces of ordnance was lying neglected on the beach; and he asked\r\nSultan Mahassan why he did not cut them up for the sake of the metal,\r\nwhich is said to contain a considerable intermixture of silver;\r\n\"but he replied, with more feeling than could have been anticipated,\r\nthat he was unwilling to deprive Aden of the only remaining sign of\r\nits former greatness and strength.\" Several of them have been sent\r\nto England since the capture of the place, measuring from fifteen to\r\neighteen and a half feet in length; they are covered with ornaments\r\nand inscriptions, stating them to have been cast in the reign of\r\n\"Soliman the son of Selim-Khan,\" (Soliman the Magnificent.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: Captain Haines, in the \"Report upon Aden,\" appended to the\r\nParliamentary papers published on the subject, erroneously places this\r\neven in 1730, the year in or about which, according to Niebuhr, the\r\nSheikh of Aden made himself independent of Sana.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: \"No part of the coast of Arabia is celebrated for the\r\ngoodness of its water, with the single exception of Aden. The wells\r\nthere are 300 in number, cut mostly though the rock, ... and the tanks\r\nwere found in good order, coated inside and out with excellant chunam,\r\n(stucco,) and merely requiring cleaning out to be again serviceable.\"]\r\n\r\nAt the time of its evacuation by the Turks, Aden is said,\r\nnotwithstanding the decay of its Indian trade, to have contained from\r\n20,000 to 30,000 inhabitants; and the lofty minarets which, a few\r\nyears since, still towered above the ruins of the mosques to which\r\nthey had formerly been attached, as well as the extensive\r\nburying-grounds, in which the turbaned headstones peculiar to the\r\nTurks are even yet conspicuous, bear testimony, not less than the\r\nextent and magnitude of the ruinous fortifications, to the\r\npopulation and splendour of the town under the Ottomans.--(See\r\nWELLSTED'S _Arabia_, vol. ii, chap. 19.) From the time, however, of\r\nits return into the hands of its former owners, its decline was rapid.\r\nNiebuhr, who visited it in the latter part of the last century, says,\r\nthat it had but little trade, as its Sheikh [39] (who had long since\r\nshaken off his dependence on the Iman of Sana) was not on good terms\r\nwith his neighbors; and, though Sir Home Popham concluded a commercial\r\ntreaty with the uncle and predecessor of the present Sultan Mahassan,\r\nno steps appear to have been taken in consequence of this arrangement.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: The town would appear to have passed into the hands of\r\nanother tribe since Niebuhr's time, as he gives the Sheikh the surname\r\nof _El-Foddeli_ (Futhali,) the present chief being of the Abdalli\r\ntribe.]\r\n\r\nIn 1835, according to Wellsted, the inhabitants of this once\r\nflourishing emporium did not exceed 800, the only industrious class\r\namong whom were the Jews, who numbered from 250 to 300. The\r\nremainder were \"the descendants of Arabs, Sumaulis,\" (a tribe of the\r\nAfrican coast,) \"and the offspring of slaves,\" who dwelt in wretched\r\nhuts, or rather tents, on the ruins of the former city. \"Not more\r\nthan twenty families are now engaged in mercantile pursuits, the\r\nrest gaining a miserable existence either by supplying the Hadj\r\nboats with wood and water, or by fishing.\" The chief, Sultan Mahassan,\r\ndid not even reside in Aden, but in a town called Lahedj, about\r\neighteen miles distant, where he kept the treasures which his uncle,\r\nwho was a brave and politic ruler, had succeeded in amassing. He\r\nreputation for wealth, however, and the inadequacy of his means for\r\ndefending it, drew on him the hostility of the more warlike tribes\r\nin the vicinity; and in 1836 Aden was sacked by the Futhalis,\r\nwho not only carried off booty to the value of 30,000 dollars,\r\n(principally the property of the Banians and the Sumauli merchants in\r\nthe port,) but compelled the Sultan to agree to an annual payment of\r\n360 dollars; while two other tribes, the Yaffaees and the Houshibees,\r\ntook the opportunity to exhort from him a tribute of half that amount.\r\nThere can be no doubt but that, if the Arabs had been left to\r\nthemselves, this state of things would have ended in all the\r\ncontending parties being speedily swallowed up in the dominions of\r\nMohammed Ali, Pasha of Egypt; who, under pretence of re-asserting\r\nthe ancient rights of the Porte to the sovereignty of Yemen, had\r\nalready occupied Mokha and Taaz, and was waging war with the tribes\r\nin the neighbouring coffee country, whom he had exasperated by the\r\ntreacherous murder of Sheikh Hussein, one of their chiefs, who,\r\nhaving been inveigled by the Egyptian commander into a personal\r\nconference, was shot dead, like the Mamlukes at Cairo, in the tent of\r\naudience. Aden, in the natural course of things, would have been the\r\nnext step; but an unforeseen intervention deprived him of his prey.\r\n\r\nSince the establishment of the overland communication with India\r\nthrough Egypt, and the steam navigation of the Red Sea, the want had\r\nbeen sensibly felt of an intermediate station between Suez and Bombay,\r\nwhich might serve both as a coal depot, and, in case of necessity,\r\nas a harbour of shelter. The position of Aden, almost exactly halfway,\r\nwould naturally have pointed it out as the sought-for haven, even\r\nhad its harbour been less admirably adapted than it is, from its\r\nfacility of entrance and depth of water close to the shore, for\r\nsteamers to run straight in, receive their fuel and water from the\r\nquay, and proceed on their voyage without loss of time; while the\r\nroadstead of Mokha, [40] the only other station which could possibly be\r\nmade available for the purpose, is at all times open and insecure,\r\nand in certain points of the wind, particularly when it blows from\r\nthe south through the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, communication with\r\nthe shore is absolutely impracticable. It was clear, therefore, that\r\nthe proposed depot, if carried into effect at all, must be fixed at\r\nAden; and there can be little doubt that its occupation was contemplated\r\nby the Indian government from the time of the visit of the surveying\r\nships to the Red Sea. A pretext was now all that was sought for, and\r\nthis was not long wanted. It was reported to the Bombay Administration\r\nin October 1836, by Captain Haines, (then in command of the Palinurus\r\nat Makullah) that great insecurity to navigation prevailed on both the\r\nAfrican and Indian shores, at the entrance of the Red Sea; and one\r\nparticular instance was adduced, in which the crew of a Muscat vessel,\r\nwrecked on the coast near Aden, were subjected to such inordinate\r\nextortion by Sultan Mahassan, that \"the master, in anger or despair,\r\nburned his vessel. The Bombay government could only give general\r\ninstructions, that in case of any outrage being offered to a vessel\r\nunder British colours, redress should be peremptorily demanded. But\r\nlong before these instructions were issued, and, indeed, before the\r\nintelligence which elicited them had reached Bombay, a case, such as\r\nthey had supposed, had really occurred.\"--(_Corresponderce relating to\r\nAden_, printed in May 1839, by order of the House of Commons,\r\nNo. 49, p. 38.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: \"A vessel will lie\" (at Mokha) \"with a whole chain on end,\r\ntopgallant masts struck, and yards braced by, without being able to\r\ncommunicate with the shore; while at the same time in Aden harbour she\r\nwill lie within a few yards of the shore, in perfectly smooth water,\r\nwith the bight of her chain cable scarcely taught.\"--CAPTAIN HAINES'S\r\n_Report_.]\r\n\r\nAn Indian ship called the Derya-Dowlut, (Fortune of the Sea,) the\r\nproperty of a lady of the family of the Nawab of Madras, but sailing\r\nunder British colours, was wrecked on the coast near Aden, February\r\n20, 1837, when on her voyage from Calcutta to Jiddah, with a cargo\r\nvalued at two lacs of rupees, (L.20,000.) It would appear, from the\r\ndepositions of the survivors, that the loss of the ship was\r\nintentional on the part of the supercargo and _nakhoda_, (or\r\nsailing-master,) the latter of whom, however, was drowned, with\r\nseveral of the crew, in attempting to get on shore in the boat. The\r\npassengers--who had been denied help both by the officers who had\r\ndeserted them, and by the Arabs who crowded down to the beach--with\r\ndifficulty reached the land, when they were stripped, plundered, and\r\nill-treated by the Bedoweens, but at last escaped without any\r\npersonal injury, and made their way in miserable plight to Aden,\r\nwhere they were relieved and clothed by a Sheikh, the hereditary\r\nguardian of the tomb of Sheikh Idris, the guardian saint of the town.\r\nThe stranded ship, meanwhile, after being cleared of as much of her\r\ncargo and stores as could be saved, was burned by direction of the\r\nsupercargo, who shortly afterwards took his departure to Jiddah,\r\ncarrying with him one-third of the rescued property, and leaving the\r\nremainder as a waif to the Sultan of Aden. After he was gone, the\r\nSultan made an offer to the agent [41] of the ship to restore the\r\ngoods which had fallen to his share on a payment of ten per cent for\r\nsalvage; but this was declined, on the ground that after such a length\r\nof time \"the things on board must have been almost all lost; that he\r\ndid not require them, nor had he money to pay for them.\" The Sultan,\r\nhowever, still refused to allow him to leave Aden till he had given\r\nhim written acquittance of all claims on account of the ship; a document\r\nwas accordingly signed, as he says, under compulsion, to the effect that\r\nhe made no claim against the Sultan, but with a full reservation of his\r\nclaim for redress from the supercargo, who had wrecked the ship and\r\nembezzled the goods saved from her. The agent and several of the crew,\r\nafter undergoing great hardships, at last reached Mokha, and laid their\r\ncomplaint before the commanders of the Company's cruisers Coote and\r\nPalinurus. The latter vessel, under the command of Captain Haines,\r\nimmediately repaired to Aden to demand redress for the injuries thus\r\ninflicted on English subjects, while a formal report of the case was made\r\nto the Government at Bombay. The Sultan at first attempted to deny that\r\nhe possessed any of the goods in question, and afterwards alleged\r\nthat they had been given to him voluntarily by the supercargo; but\r\nfinding all his subterfuges unavailing, he at length gave up\r\nmerchandize and stores to the amount of nearly 8000 dollars, besides\r\na bond at a year's date for 4191 dollars more, in satisfaction for\r\nthe goods which had been previously sold or made away with, as well\r\nas for the insults offered to the passengers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: This person, Syud Nooradeen, had been captain of the\r\nvessel at the outset of the voyage; but had been deposed from the\r\nresponsible command by an order purporting to come from the merchant\r\nwho had freighted the ship, but which is now said to have been forged\r\nby the supercargo.]\r\n\r\nHere, in ordinary cases, the matter might have rested; for though\r\nthe conduct of this Arab chief would certainly have been\r\nindefensible in a civilized country, the worst charge that can be\r\nconsidered as fairly proved against him is that of being a receiver\r\nof stolen goods, as the price of his connivance at the appropriation\r\nof the rest by the supercargo--since with the wreck of the ship,\r\nwhether premeditated or not, he had certainly nothing to do--and the\r\noutrages committed by the wild Bedoweens on the beach can scarcely be\r\nlaid to his charge. A far more atrocious insult to the British flag in\r\n1826, when a brig from the Mauritius had been piratically seized at\r\nBerbera, (a port on the African coast, just outside the Straits of\r\nBab-el-Mandeb,) and part of her crew murdered, had been expiated by\r\nthe submission of the offenders, and the repayment of the value of the\r\nplunder by yearly instalments, (see WELLSTED'S _Arabia_, vol. ii.\r\nchap. 18;)--whereas, in the present case, restitution, however reluctant,\r\nhad been prompt and complete. But so eager were the authorities in India\r\nto possess themselves of the place on any terms, that even while the\r\nabove-mentioned negotiation was pending, a minute was drawn up\r\n(Sept. 28) by the Governor of Bombay, and transmitted to the\r\nGovernor-general at Calcutta, in which, after stating that \"the\r\nestablishment of a monthly communication by steam with the Red Sea,\r\nand the formation of a flotilla of armed steamers, renders it\r\n_absolutely necessary_ that we should have a station of our own on\r\nthe coast of Arabia, as we already have on the Persian Gulf\"\r\n--alluding to the seizure of the island of Karrack--and noticing\r\n\"the insult which has been offered to the British flag by the Sultan\r\nof Aden,\" requests permission \"to take possession of Cape Aden.\" [42]\r\nThe Governor-general, however, in his reply, (Oct. 16,) appears scarcely\r\nof opinion that so strong a measure is warranted by the provocation,\r\nand suggests \"that satisfaction should, in the first instance, be\r\ndemanded of the Sultan. If it be granted, some _amicable arrangement_\r\nmay be made with him for the occupation of this port as a depot for\r\ncoals, and harbour for shelter. If it be refused, then further measures\r\nmay be considered.\" [43]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: Correspondence, No. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: Ibid. No. 19.]\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the qualified terms of the Governor-general's\r\nreply, it appears to have been regarded by the Bombay government as\r\nequivalent to a full permission [44] for the prosecution of the\r\nobject on which they had fixed their views: for by the despatch\r\nof Captain Haines from Aden, (dated Jan. 20, 1838,) we find that no\r\nsooner had he \"completed the first duty on which he was sent,\"\r\n(the recovery of the cargo of the Derya-Dowlet,) than he addressed a\r\nletter (Jan. 11) to the Sultan, to the effect that \"he was empowered\r\nby Government to form a treaty with the Sultan for the purchase of\r\nAden, with the land and points surrounding it,\" &c. &c.--that he felt\r\nassured that the Sultan \"would, in his wisdom, readily foresee the\r\nadvantages which would accrue to his country from having such an\r\nintimate connecting link with the British\"--and enclosing a rough\r\ndraft of the terms on which it was proposed that the transfer should\r\nbe effected. The Sultan appears to have been considerably _taken\r\naback_ at this unexpected proposition, which, it should be observed,\r\nwas not put forward as part of the atonement required for the affair\r\nof the Derya-Dowlut--as for this, (in the words of Captain Haines,)\r\n\"satisfaction has been given by you, and our friendship is as before.\"\r\nA lengthened correspondence ensued, at the rate of a letter or two\r\ndaily, till the end of January--in which the Sultan, with all the\r\ntortuous tact of an Asiatic, endeavoured, without expressly pledging\r\nhimself on the main point, to stipulate in the first instance for\r\nassistance, in the shape of artillery and ammunition, against the\r\nhostile tribes in the neighbourhood, and other advantages for\r\nhimself and his family, particularly for the retention of their\r\njurisdiction over the _Arab_ residents in Aden: and he at last\r\nquitted Aden for Lahedj, without absolutely concluding any thing,\r\nbut having authorized a merchant of the former place, named\r\nReshid-Ebn-Abdallah, to act as his agent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: \"The Government of India did not, indeed, in express\r\nwords authorize us to negotiate with the Sultan for a cession to us\r\nof the post and harbour: but they desired us to obtain the occupation\r\nof the port as a coal depot, and that of the harbour as a place of\r\nshelter. These words far exceed the mere establishment of a coal depot\r\nunder the auspices of the Sultan, and in fact, could not in any\r\npractical sense, or to any beneficial purpose, be fulfilled, except\r\nby our obtaining the occupation of that port and harbour as a matter\r\nnot of sufferance but of right.\"--_Minute by the Governor of Bombay_,\r\nNo. 49.]\r\n\r\nStill every thing appeared in a fair way for adjustment; the\r\nprincipal difficulty remaining to be settled being the annual sum to\r\nbe paid as an equivalent for the port-dues of Aden. The Sultan's\r\ncommissioner at first rated this source of revenue at the exorbitant\r\nsum of 50,000 dollars!--but it was at last agreed that it should be\r\ncommuted for a yearly stipend of 8708, a mode of payment preferred\r\nby the Sultan to the receipt of a gross sum, lest the rapacity of\r\nhis neighbours should be excited against him by so sudden an\r\naccession of wealth: while the amount thus fixed was believed even\r\nto exceed the actual amount of the customs. The Sultan meanwhile,\r\nthough evading the formal execution of the deed of transfer,\r\nconstantly wrote from Lahedj that the English were at liberty to\r\nbegin building in Aden as soon as they pleased--adding on more than\r\none occasion--\"if the Turks or any other people should come and take\r\naway the whole country by strength from me, the blame will not rest\r\non my shoulders.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 27th, however, Sultan Hamed, the eldest son and heir-apparent\r\nof Sultan Mahassan, arrived at Aden from Lahedj, accompanied by a\r\n_synd_ or descendant of the prophet, named Hussein, who was\r\nrepresented as having come as a witness to the transaction; and\r\nCaptain Haines was invited on shore to meet them. While he was\r\npreparing, however, to repair to the place of meeting, he received a\r\nprivate intimation through the merchant already mentioned,\r\nReshid-Ebn-Abdallih, to the effect that the Arab chiefs had\r\ndetermined on seizing his person at the interview, in order to\r\npossess themselves of the papers connected with the proposed\r\ntransfer of Aden, (to which Sultan Hamed had from the first been\r\nstrongly opposed,) and in particular of the bond for 4191 dollars\r\nwhich had been given in satisfaction for the balance of the goods in\r\nthe Derya-Dowlut. How far this imputed treachery was really meditated,\r\nthere can be, of course, no means of precisely ascertaining; and the\r\nminute of the governor of Bombay (_Correspondence_, No. 49,) seems\r\nto consider it doubtful; [45] but Captain Haines acted as if fully\r\nconvinced of the correctness of the intelligence which he had\r\nreceived; and after reproaching Sultan Hamed with his intended\r\nperfidy, returned first to Mokha, and afterwards (in February) to\r\nBombay, carrying with him the letter in which the old Sultan was\r\nalleged to have given his consent to the cession, but leaving the\r\nrecovered goods at Aden in charge of a Banyan--a tolerably strong\r\nproof, by the way, that the Sultan, notwithstanding the bad faith\r\nlaid to his charge, was not considered likely to appropriate them\r\nafresh.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: \"I am not, however, disposed to treat the matter as\r\none of much importance. We have no knowledge of it but from report,\r\nand all concerned in it will solemnly deny the truth of the\r\ninformation.\"]\r\n\r\nThe unsuccessful issue of this mission pretty clearly proved, that\r\nnotwithstanding the dread of the British power entertained by the\r\nAbdalli chiefs, their reluctance to part with their town would not\r\nbe easily overcome by peaceable means: while the Governor-general\r\n(then busily engaged at Simla in forwarding the preparations for the\r\nill-fated invasion of Affghanistan) still declined, in despite of a\r\nrenewed application from Bombay to give any special sanction to\r\nulterior measures--\"a question on which\"--in the words of the\r\ndespatch--\"her Majesty's Government is rather called upon to\r\npronounce judgment, than the supreme government of India.\" The\r\nauthorities at Bombay, however, were not to be thus diverted from\r\nthe attainment of their favourite object; and in a despatch of\r\nSeptember 7, 1838, to the Secret Committee, (_Corresp_. No. 59,)\r\nthey announce that, \"on reconsideration, they have resolved to adopt\r\nimmediate measures for attempting to obtain peaceable possession of\r\nAden, without waiting for the previous instructions of the\r\nGovernor-general of India:\" but \"as the steamer Berenice will leave\r\nBombay on the 8th inst.,\" (_the next day_,) \"we have not time to\r\nenter into a detail of the reasons which have induced us to come to\r\nthe above resolution.\" A notification similar to the above had been\r\nforwarded two days previously to Lord Auckland at Simla; and a\r\nlaconic reply was received (Oct. 4) from Sir William Macnaghten,\r\nsimply to the effect that \"his lordship was glad to find that, at\r\nthe present crisis of our affairs, the governor (of Bombay) in\r\ncouncil has resolved to resort to no other than peaceful means\r\nfor the attainment of the object in view.\"\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of October, accordingly, Captain Haines once more\r\nreached Aden in the Coote, with a small party of Bombay sepoys on\r\nboard as his escort; but the aspect of affairs was by no means\r\nfavourable. The old Sultan Mahassan, worn out with age and\r\ninfirmities, had resigned the management of affairs almost entirely\r\nto his fiery son Hamed, who, encouraged not only by his success in\r\nbaffling the former attempt, but by the smallness of the force which\r\nhad accompanied the British commissioner, [46] openly set him at\r\ndefiance, declaring that he himself, and not his father, was now the\r\nSultan of the Bedoweens: that his father was but an imbecile old man;\r\nand that any promise which might have been extorted from him could\r\nnot be regarded as of any avail: and, in short, that the place\r\nshould not be given up upon any terms. In pursuance of this\r\ndenunciation, all supplies, even of wood and water, were refused to\r\nthe ship; the Banyan in charge of the Derya-Dowlut's cargo was\r\nprohibited from giving up the goods to the English; and though the\r\ninterchange of letters was kept up as briskly as before, the\r\nresolution of Sultan Hamed was not to be shaken by this torrent of\r\ndiplomacy: and he constantly adhered to his first expressed\r\nposition--\"I wish much to be friends, and that amity was between us,\r\nbut you must not speak or write about the land of Aden again.\" The\r\nEnglish agent, however, persisted in speaking of the transfer as\r\nalready legally concluded, and out of the power of Hamed to\r\nrepudiate or annul: while, in order to give greater stringency to\r\nhis remonstrances, he gave orders for the detention of the\r\ndate-boats and other vessels which arrived off Aden, hoping to\r\nstarve the Sultan into submission, by thus at once stopping his\r\nprovisions, and cutting off his receipt of port dues. The blockade\r\ndoes not seem to have been very effectual: and an overture from the\r\nFuthali chief to aid with his tribe in an attack on the Abdallis, was\r\nof course declined by Captain Haines.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: \"Their first exclamation was, 'Are the English so poor\r\nthat they can only afford to send one vessel? and is she only come to\r\ntalk? Why did they not send her before? Had they sent their men and\r\nvessels, we would have given up; but until they do, they shall never\r\nhave the place.'\"--CAPTAIN HAINES'S _Despatch_, Nov. 6, (No. 61.)]\r\n\r\nThe apparently interminable cross fire of protocols [47]  (in which both\r\nCaptain Haines and his employers appear to have luxuriated to a degree\r\nwhich would have gladdened the heart of Lord Palmerston himself) was now,\r\nhowever, on the point of being brought to a close. On the 20th of\r\nNovember, one of the Coote's boats, while engaged in overhauling an\r\nArab vessel near the shore, was fired at by the Bedoweens on the beach,\r\nand hostilities were carried on during several days, but with little\r\ndamage on either side. In most cases, it would have been considered\r\nthat blockading a port, and intercepting its supplies of provisions\r\nconstituted a sufficiently legitimate ground of warfare to justify\r\nthese reprisals: but Captain Haines, it appears, thought otherwise,\r\nas he stigmatizes it as \"a shameful and cowardly attack,\" and\r\nbecomes urgent with the Bombay government for a reinforcement which\r\nmight enable him to assume offensive operations with effect. Her\r\nMajesty's ships Volage, 28, and Cruiser, 16 gun-brig, which had been\r\nemployed in some operations about the mouth of the Indus, were\r\naccordingly ordered on this service, and sailed from Bombay December\r\n29, accompanied by two transports conveying about 800 troops--Europeans,\r\nsepoys, and artillerymen--under the command-in-chief of Major Baillie,\r\n24th Bombay native infantry. The Abdalli chiefs, on the other hand,\r\nmade an effort to induce the Sultan of the Futhalis, (with whom they\r\nheld a conference during the first days of 1839, at the tomb of\r\nSheikh Othman near Aden, on the occasion of the payment of the annual\r\ntribute above referred to,) to make common cause with them against\r\nthe intruders who were endeavouring to establish themselves in the\r\ncountry; but the negotiation wholly failed, and the two parties\r\nseparated on not very amicable terms.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: It is worthy of remark, that in a note of December 1st,\r\n(_Corresp_. No. 81,) from the Governor of Bombay to the Sultan,\r\nthe ill treatment of the passengers of the Derya-Dowlut is again\r\nadvanced as the ground of offence, as an atonement for which the\r\ncession of Aden is indispensable; though for this, ample satisfaction\r\nhad been admitted long since to have been given.]\r\n\r\nIt appears that the determination of the Abdallis to hold out had\r\nbeen materially strengthened by the intelligence which they received\r\nfrom India, (where many Arabs from this part of Yemen and the\r\nneighbouring country of Hadramout are serving as mercenaries to the\r\nnative princes,) of the manifold distractions which beset the\r\nAnglo-Indian government, and the armaments in course of equipment for\r\nAffghanistan, Scinde, the Persian Gulf, &c., and which confirmed\r\nthem in the belief that no more troops could be spared from Bombay\r\nfor an attack on Aden. The stoppage of provisions by sea, however,\r\nand the threatened hostilities of the Futhalis, caused severe\r\ndistress among the inhabitants of the town; and dissensions arose\r\namong the chiefs themselves, as to the proportions in which (in the\r\nevent of an amicable settlement) the annual payment of 8700 dollars\r\nshould be divided among them--it being determined that Sultan\r\nMahassan should not have it all. An attempt was now made by the\r\n_synds_ to effect a reconciliation; but though abundance of notes\r\nwere once more interchanged, [48] and the old Sultan came down\r\nfrom Lahedj to offer his mediation, all demands for the main\r\nobject, the cession of the place, were rejected or evaded. The\r\nnegotiation consequently came to nothing, and hostilities were\r\nresumed with more energy than before, the artillery of Aden being\r\ndirected (as was reported) by an European Turk; till, on the 16th of\r\nJanuary, the flotilla from Bombay, under the command of Captain Smith,\r\nR.N., anchored in Western Bay.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: In this correspondence, the phrase of--\"If you will\r\nland and enter the town, I will be upon your head,\" is more than once\r\naddressed by Sultan Hamed to Captain Haines and seems to have been\r\nunderstood as a menace; but we have been informed that it rather\r\nimplies, \"I will be answerable for your safety--your head shall be\r\nin my charge.\"]\r\n\r\nA peremptory requisition was now sent on shore for the immediate\r\nsurrender of the town; but the answer of the Sultan was still evasive,\r\nand, as the troops had only a few days' water on board, an immediate\r\nlanding was decided upon. On the morning of the 19th, accordingly,\r\nthe Coote, Cruiser, Volage, and the Company's armed schooner Mahi,\r\nweighed and stood in shore, opening a heavy fire on the island of\r\nSeerah and the batteries on the mainland, to cover the disembarkation.\r\nThe Arabs at first stood to their guns with great determination, but\r\ntheir artillery was, of course, speedily silenced or dismounted by\r\nthe superior weight and rapidity of the English fire; and though the\r\ntroops were galled while in the boats by matchlocks from the shore,\r\nboth the town and the island of Seerah were carried by storm without\r\nmuch difficulty. The loss of the assailants was no more than fifteen\r\nkilled and wounded--that of the Arabs more than ten times that number,\r\nincluding a nephew of the Sultan and a chief of the Houshibee tribe,\r\nwho fought gallantly, and received a mortal wound; considerable\r\nbloodshed was also occasioned by the desperate resistance made by the\r\nprisoners taken on Seerah in the attempt to disarm them, during which\r\nthe greater part of them cut their way through their captors and got\r\nclear off. Most of the inhabitants fled into the interior during the\r\nassault, but speedily returned on hearing of the discipline and good\r\norder preserved by the conquerors; and the old Sultan, on being\r\ninformed of the capture of the place, sent an apologetic letter\r\n(Jan. 21) to Captain Haines, in which he threw all the blame on his\r\nson Hamed, and expressed an earnest wish for a reconciliation.\r\nLittle difficulty was now experienced in conducting the negotiations,\r\nand during the first days of February articles of pacification were\r\nsigned both with the Abdallis and the other tribes in the\r\nneighbourhood. To secure the good-will of the Futhali chief, the\r\nannual payment which he had received from Aden of 360 dollars, was\r\nstill guaranteed to him, as were the 8700 dollars per annum to the\r\nSultan of Lahedj, whose bond for 4191 dollars was further remitted\r\nas a token of good-will.\r\n\r\nSuch were the circumstances under which Aden became part of the\r\ncolonial empire of Great Britain--and the details of which we have\r\ntaken, almost entirely, from the official accounts published by\r\norder of Government. In whatever point of view we consider the\r\ntransaction, we think it can scarcely be denied that it reflects\r\nlittle credit on the national character for even-handed justice and\r\nfair dealing. Even if the tact and _savoir faire_, which Captain\r\nHaines must be admitted to have displayed in an eminent degree in\r\nthe execution of his instructions, had succeeded in intimidating the\r\nArabs into surrendering the place without resistance, such a\r\nproceeding would have amounted to nothing more or less than the\r\nappropriation of the territory of a tribe not strong enough to defend\r\nthemselves, simply because it was situated conveniently for the\r\npurposes of our own navigation: and the open force by which the\r\nscheme was ultimately carried into effect, imparts to this act of\r\nusurpation a character of violence still more to be regretted. The\r\noriginally-alleged provocation, the affair of the Derya-Dowlut, is\r\nnot for a moment tenable as warranting such extreme measures:--since\r\nnot only was the participation of the parties on whom the whole\r\nresponsibility was thrown, at all events extremely venial; but\r\nsatisfaction had been given, and had been admitted to have been given,\r\nbefore the subject of the cession of the place was broached:--and\r\nthe Sultan constantly denied that his alleged consent to the transfer,\r\non which the subsequent hostilities were grounded, had ever been\r\nintended to be so construed. It is evident, moreover, that the Arabs\r\nwould gladly have yielded to any amicable arrangement short of the\r\nabsolute cession of the town, which they regarded as disgraceful:\r\n--the erection of a factory, which might have been fortified so as\r\nto give us the virtual command of the place and the harbour, would\r\nprobably have met with no opposition:--and even if Aden had fallen,\r\nas it seemed on the point of doing, into the hands of the Pasha of\r\nEgypt, there can be little doubt that the Viceroy would have shown\r\nhimself equally ready to facilitate our intercourse with India, in\r\nhis Arabian as in his Egyptian harbours. At all events, it is\r\nevident that the desired object of obtaining a station and coal\r\ndepot for the Indian steamers, might easily have been secured in\r\nvarious ways, without running even the risk of bringing on the\r\nBritish name the imputation of unnecessary violence and oppression.\r\n\r\nAden, however, was now, whether for right or wrong, under the British\r\nflag; but the hostile dispositions of the Arabs, notwithstanding the\r\ntreaties entered into, were still far from subdued; and the cupidity\r\nof these semi-barbarous tribes was still further excited by the\r\nlavish expenditure of the new garrison, and by the exaggerated\r\nreports of vast treasures said to be brought from India for the\r\nrepairs of the works. Among the advantages anticipated by Captain\r\nHaines in his official report from the possession of the town,\r\nespecial stress is laid on its vicinity to the coffee and gum\r\ndistricts, and the certainty, that when it was under the settled\r\nrule of British law, the traffic in these rich products, as well as\r\nin the gold-dust, ivory, and frankincense of the African coast,\r\nwould once more centre in its long-neglected harbour. But it was\r\nspeedily found that the insecurity of communication with the\r\ninterior opposed a serious obstacle to the realization of these\r\nprospects--the European residents and the troops were confined\r\nwithin the Turkish wall--and though the extreme heat of the climate\r\n(which during summer averaged 90° of Fahrenheit in the shade within\r\na stone house) did not prove so injurious as had been expected to\r\nEuropean constitutions, it was found, singularly enough, to exercise\r\na most pernicious influence on the sepoys, who sickened and died in\r\nalarming numbers. Aden at this period is compared, in a letter\r\nquoted in the _Asiatic Journal_, to \"the crater of Etna enlarged,\r\nand covered with gravestones and the remains of stone huts;\"\r\nprovisions were scarce, and vegetables scarcely procurable. By\r\ndegrees, however, some symptoms of reviving trade appeared and by the\r\nend of 1839 the population had increased to 1500 souls.\r\n\r\nThe smouldering rancour with which the Arabs had all along regarded\r\nthe Frank intruders upon their soil, had by this time broken out\r\ninto open hostility; and, after some minor acts of violence, an\r\nattack was made on the night of November 9th on the Turkish wall\r\nacross the isthmus, (which had been additionally strengthened by\r\nredoubts and some guns,) by a body of 4000 men, collected from the\r\nAbdallis, the Futhalis, and the other tribes in the neighbourhood.\r\nThe assailants were of course repulsed, but not without a severe\r\nconflict, in which the Arabs engaged the defenders hand to hand\r\nwith the most determined valour--so highly had their hopes of\r\nplunder been stimulated by the rumours of English wealth. This\r\ndaring attempt (which the Pasha of Egypt was by some suspected\r\nto have had some share in instigating) at once placed the occupants\r\nof Aden in a state of open warfare with all their Arab neighbours;\r\nand the subsidies hitherto paid to the Futhali chief and the old\r\nSultan of Lahedj were consequently stopped--while L.100,000 were\r\nvoted by the Bombay government for repairing the fortifications,\r\nand engineers were sent from India to put the place in an efficient\r\nstate of defence. These regular ramparts, however, even when\r\ncompleted, can never be relied on as a security against the guerilla\r\nattacks of these daring marauders, who can wade through the sea at\r\nlow water round the flanks of the Turkish wall, and scramble over\r\nprecipices to get in the rear of the outposts--and accordingly,\r\nduring 1840, the garrison had to withstand two more desperate\r\nattempts (May 20, and July 4,) to surprise the place, both of which\r\nwere beaten off after some hard fighting, though in one instance the\r\nattacking party succeeded in carrying off a considerable amount of\r\nplunder from the encampment near the Turkish wall. Since that period,\r\nit has been found necessary gradually to raise the strength of the\r\ngarrison from 800 to 4000 men, one-fourth of whom are always European\r\nsoldiers--and though no attack in force has lately been made by the\r\nArabs, the necessity of being constantly on the alert against their\r\ncovert approaches, renders the duties of the garrison harassing to\r\nthe last degree. Though a considerable trade now exists with the\r\nAfrican coast, scarcely any commercial intercourse has yet been\r\nestablished with the interior of Arabia, (notwithstanding the\r\nfriendly dispositions evinced by the Iman of Sana,) the road being\r\nbarred by the hostile tribes--and a further impediment to\r\nimprovement is found in the dissensions of the civil and military\r\nauthorities of the place itself, who, pent up in a narrow space\r\nunder a broiling sun, seem to employ their energies in endless\r\nsquabbles with each other. Whatever may be the ultimate fate of this\r\ncolony, it must be allowed, to quote the candid admission of a\r\nwriter in the _United Service Journal_, that \"at present we are not\r\noccupying a very proud position in Arabia\"--though considering the\r\nmeans by which we obtained our footing in that peninsula, our\r\nposition is perhaps as good as we deserve.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONNET\r\n\r\n  BY THE AUTHOR OP THE LIFE OF BURKE, OF GOLDSMITH, &C.,\r\n\r\n  ON VIEWING MY MOTHER'S PICTURE.\r\n\r\n  How warms the heart when dwelling on that face,\r\n    Those lips that mine a thousand times have prest,\r\n  The swelling source that nurture gav'st her race,\r\n    Where found my infant head its downiest rest!\r\n  How in those features aim to trace my own,\r\n    Cast in a softer mould my being see;\r\n  Recall the voice that sooth'd my helpless moan,\r\n    The thoughts that sprang for scarcely aught save me;\r\n  That shaped and formed me; gave me to the day,\r\n    Bade in her breast absorbing love arise;\r\n  O'er me a ceaseless tender care display,\r\n    For weak all else to thee maternal ties!\r\n  This debt of love but One may claim; no other\r\n  Such self-devotion boasts, save thee, my Mother!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCALEB STUKELY.\r\n\r\n  PART XIII.\r\n\r\n  THE FUGITIVE.\r\n\r\nThe tongue has nothing to say when the soul hath spoken all! What\r\nneed of words in the passionate and early intercourse of love! There\r\nis no oral language that can satisfy or meet the requisitions of the\r\nstricken heart. Speech, the worldling and the false--oftener the\r\ndark veil than the bright mirror of man's thoughts--is banished from\r\nthe spot consecrated to purity, unselfishness, and truth. The lovely\r\nand beloved Ellen learnt, before a syllable escaped my lips, the\r\nsecret which those lips would never have disclosed. Her innocent and\r\nconscious cheek acknowledged instantly her quick perception, and\r\nwith maiden modesty she turned aside--not angrily, but timorous as a\r\nbird, upon whose leafy covert the heavy fowler's foot has trod too\r\nharshly and too suddenly. I thought of nothing then but the pain I\r\nhad inflicted, and was sensible of no feeling but that of shame and\r\nsorrow for my fault. We walked on in silence. Our road brought us to\r\nthe point in the village at which I had met Miss Fairman and her\r\nfather, when, for the first time, we became companions in our\r\nevening walk. We retraced the path which then we took, and the\r\nhallowed spot grew lovelier as we followed it. I could not choose\r\nbut tell how deeply and indelibly the scene of beauty had become\r\nimprinted on my heart.\r\n\r\n\"To you, Miss Fairman,\" I began, \"and to others who were born and\r\nnurtured in this valley, this is a common sight. To me it is a land\r\nof enchantment, and the impression that it brings must affect my\r\nfuture being. I am sure, whatever may be my lot, that I shall be a\r\nhappier man for what I now behold.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is well,\" said my companion, \"that you did not make the\r\nacquaintance of our hills during the bleak winter, when their charms\r\nwere hidden in the snow, and they had nothing better to offer their\r\nworshipper than rain and sleet and nipping winds. They would have\r\nlost your praise then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so? Imprisoned as I have been, and kept a stranger to\r\nthe noblest works of Providence, my enjoyment is excessive, and I\r\ndare scarcely trust myself to feel it as I would. I could gaze on\r\nyonder sweet hillock, with its wild-flowers and its own blue patch\r\nof sky, until I wept.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, this is a lovely scene in truth!\" exclaimed Miss Fairman\r\npensively.\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember, Miss Fairman, our first spring walk? For an hour\r\nwe went on, and that little green clump, as it appears from here,\r\nwas not for a moment out of my sight. My eyes were riveted upon it,\r\nand I watched the clouds shifting across it, changing its hue, now\r\ndarkening, now lighting it up, until it became fixed in my\r\nremembrance, never to depart from it. We have many fair visions\r\naround us, but that is to me the fairest. It is connected with our\r\nevening walk. Neither can be forgotten whilst I live.\"\r\n\r\nIt was well that we reached the parsonage gate before another word\r\nwas spoken. In spite of the firmest of resolutions, the smallest\r\nself-indulgence brought me to the very verge of transgression.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I sat alone, and began a letter to the minister. I\r\nwrote a few lines expressive of my gratitude and deep sense of\r\nobligation. They did not read well, and I destroyed them. I\r\nrecommenced. I reproached myself for presumption and temerity, and\r\nconfessed that I had taken advantage of his confidence by attempting\r\nto gain the affections of his only child. I regretted the fault, and\r\ndesired to be dismissed. The terms which I employed, on reperusal,\r\nlooked too harsh, and did not certainly do justice to the motives by\r\nwhich throughout I had been actuated; for, however violent had been\r\nmy passion, _principle_ had still protected and restrained me. I had\r\nnot coldly and _deliberately_ betrayed myself. The second writing,\r\nnot more satisfactory than the first, was, in its turn, expunged. I\r\nattempted a third epistle, and failed. Then I put down the pen and\r\nconsidered. I pondered until I concluded that I had ever been too\r\nhasty and too violent. Miss Fairman would certainly take no notice\r\nof what had happened, and if I were guarded--silent--and determined\r\nfor the future, all would still be well. It was madness to indulge a\r\npassion which could only lead to my expulsion from the parsonage, and\r\nend in misery. Had I found it so easy to obtain a home and quiet,\r\nthat both were to be so recklessly and shamefully abandoned? Surely\r\nit was time to dwell soberly and seriously upon the affairs of life.\r\nI had numbered years and undergone trial sufficient to be acquainted\r\nwith true policy and the line of duty. Both bade me instantly reject\r\nthe new solicitation, and pursue, with singleness of purpose, the\r\noccupation which fortune had mercifully vouchsafed to me. All this\r\nwas specious and most just, and sounded well to the understanding\r\nthat was not less able to look temperately and calmly upon the\r\nargument in consequence of the previous overflow of feeling. Reason\r\nis never so plausible and prevailing as when it takes the place of\r\ngratified passion. Never are we so firmly resolved upon good, as in\r\nthe moment that follows instantly the doing of evil. Never is\r\nconscience louder in her complaints than when she rises from a\r\ntemporary overthrow. I had discovered every thing to Miss Fairman. I\r\nhad fatally committed myself. There was no doubt of this; and\r\nnothing was left for present consolation but sapient resolutions for\r\nthe future. Virtuous and fixed they looked in my silent chamber and\r\nin the silent hour of night. Morning had yet to dawn, and they had\r\nyet to contend with the thousand incitements which our desires are\r\never setting up to battle with our better judgment. I did not write\r\nto Mr. Fairman, but I rose from my seat much comforted, and softened\r\nmy midnight pillow with the best intentions.\r\n\r\nFancy might have suggested to me, on the following morning, that the\r\neyes of Miss Fairnan had been visited but little by sleep, and that\r\nher face was far more pallid than usual, if her parent had not\r\nremarked, with much anxiety, when she took her place amongst us,\r\nthat she was looking most weary and unwell. Like the sudden\r\nemanation that crimsons all the east, the beautiful and earliest\r\nblush of morning, came the driven blood into the maiden's cheek,\r\ntelling of discovery and shame. Nothing she said in answer, but\r\ndiligently pursued her occupation. I could perceive that the fair\r\nhand trembled, and that the gentle bosom was disquieted. _I_ could\r\ntell why downwards bent the head, and with what new emotions the\r\nartless spirit had become acquainted. Instantly I saw the mischief\r\nwhich my rashness had occasioned, and felt how deeply had fallen the\r\nfirst accents of love into the poor heart of the secluded one. What\r\nhad I done by the short, indistinct, most inconsiderate avowal, and\r\nhow was it possible now to avert its consequences? Every tender and\r\nuneasy glance that Mr. Fairman cast upon his cherished daughter,\r\npassed like a sting to me, and roused the bitterest self-reproach. I\r\ncould have calmed his groundless fears, had I been bold enough to\r\nrisk his righteous indignation. The frankness and cordiality which\r\nhad ever marked my intercourse with Miss Fairman, were from this\r\nhour suspended. Could it be otherwise with one so innocent, so\r\ntruthful, and so meek! Anger she had none, but apprehension and\r\nconceptions strange, such as disturb the awakened soul of woman, ere\r\nthe storm of passion comes to overcharge it.\r\n\r\nI slunk from the apartment and the first meal of the day, like a man\r\nguilty of a heinous fault. I pleaded illness, and did not rejoin my\r\nfriends. I knew not what to do, and I passed a day in long and\r\nfeverish doubt. Evening arrived. My pupils were dismissed, and once\r\nmore I sat in my own silent room lost in anxious meditation. Suddenly\r\nan unusual knock at the door roused me, and brought me to my feet. I\r\nrequested the visitor to enter, and Mr. Fairman himself walked slowly\r\nin. He was pale and care-worn and he looked, as I imagined, sternly\r\nupon me. \"All is known!\" was my first thought, and my throat swelled\r\nwith agitation. I presented a chair to the incumbent; and when he\r\nsat down and turned his wan face upon me, I felt that my own cheek\r\nwas no less blanched than his. I awaited his rebuke in breathless\r\nsuspense.\r\n\r\n\"You are indeed ill, Stukely,\" commenced Mr. Fairman, gazing\r\nearnestly. \"I was not aware of this, or I would have seen you before.\r\nYou have overworked yourself with the boys. You shall be relieved\r\nto-morrow. I will take charge of them myself. You should not have\r\npersevered when you found your strength unequal to the task. A\r\nlittle repose will, I trust, restore you.\"\r\n\r\nWith every animating syllable, the affrighted blood returned again,\r\nand I gained confidence. His tones assured me that he was still in\r\nignorance. A load was taken from me.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be better in the morning, sir,\" I answered. \"Do not think\r\nseriously of the slightest indisposition. I am better now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am rejoiced to hear it,\" answered the incumbent. \"I am full of\r\nalarm and wretchedness to-day. Did you observe my daughter this\r\nmorning, Stukely?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" I faltered.\r\n\r\n\"You did at breakfast, but you have not seen her since. I wish you\r\nhad. I am sick at heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she unwell, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what consumption is? Have you ever watched its fearful\r\nprogress?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you might have done so. It is a fearful disease, and\r\nleaves hardly a family untouched. Did she not look ill?--you can\r\ntell me that, at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not quite so well, perhaps, as I have seen her, sir; but I should\r\nhope\"--\r\n\r\n\"Eh--what, not very ill, then? Well, that is strange, for I was\r\nfrightened by her. What can it be? I wish that Mayhew had called in.\r\nEvery ailment fills me with terror. I always think of her dear mother.\r\nThree months before her death, she sat with me, as we do here\r\ntogether, well and strong, and thanking Providence for health and\r\nstrength. She withered, as it might be from that hour, and, as I\r\ntell you, three short months of havoc brought her to the grave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was she young, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"A few years older than my child--but that is nothing. Did you say\r\nyou did not think her looks this morning indicated any symptoms?\r\nOh--no! I recollect. You never saw the malady at work. Well,\r\ncertainly she does not cough as her poor mother did. Did it look\r\nlike languor, think you?\"\r\n\r\n\"The loss of rest might\"--\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it might, and perhaps it is nothing worse. I know Mayhew\r\nthinks lightly of these temporary shadows; but I do not believe he\r\nhas ever seen her so thoroughly feeble and depressed as she appears\r\nto-day. She is very pale, but I was glad to find her face free from\r\nall flush whatever. That is comforting. Let us hope the best. How do\r\nthe boys advance? What opinion have you formed of the lad Charlton?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a dull, good-hearted boy, sir. Willing to learn, with little\r\nability to help him on. Most difficult of treatment. His tears lie\r\nnear the surface. At times it seems that the simplest terms are\r\nbeyond his understanding, and then the gentlest reproof opens the\r\nflood-gate, and submerges his faculties for the day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be tender and cautious, Stukely, with that child. He is a sapling\r\nthat will not bear the rough wind. Let him learn what he will--rest\r\nassured, it is all he can. His eagerness to learn will never fall\r\nshort of your's to teach. He must be kindly encouraged, not frowned\r\nupon in his reverses; for who fights so hard against them, or\r\ndeplores them more deeply than himself? Poor, weak child, he is his\r\nown chastiser.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will take care, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen this coming on, Stukely?\"\r\n\r\n\"With Charlton, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Miss Fairman's indisposition. For many weeks she has certainly\r\nimproved in health. I have remarked it, and I was taken by surprise\r\nthis morning. I should be easier had Mayhew seen her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me fetch him in the morning, sir. His presence will relieve you.\r\nI will start early--and bring him with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you are better, but certainly not otherwise. I confess I\r\nshould be pleased to talk with him. But do not rise too early. Get\r\nyour breakfast first. I will take the boys until you come back.\"\r\n\r\nThis had been the object of the anxious father's visit. As soon as I\r\nhad undertaken to meet his wish, he became more tranquil. My mission\r\nwas to be kept a secret. The reason why a servant had not been\r\nemployed, was the fear of causing alarm in the beloved patient.\r\nBefore Mr. Fairman left me, I was more than half persuaded that I\r\nmyself had mistaken the cause of his daughter's suffering; so\r\nagreeable is it, even against conviction, to discharge ourselves of\r\nblame.\r\n\r\nThe residence of Dr. Mayhew was about four miles distant from our\r\nvillage. It was a fine brick house, as old as the oaks which stood\r\nbefore it, conferring upon a few acres of grass land the right to be\r\nregarded as a park. The interior of the house was as substantial as\r\nthe outside; both were as solid as the good doctor himself. He was a\r\nman of independent property, a member of the University of Oxford,\r\nand a great stickler for old observances. He received a fee from\r\nevery man who was able to pay him for his services; and the poor\r\nmight always receive at his door, at the cost of application only,\r\nmedical advice and physic, and a few commodities much more\r\nacceptable than either. He kept a good establishment, in the most\r\ninteresting portion of which dwelt three decaying creatures, the\r\nyoungest fourscore years of age and more. They were an entail from\r\nhis grandfather, and had faithfully served that ancestor for many\r\nyears as coachman, housekeeper, and butler. The father of Dr. Mayhew\r\nhad availed himself of their integrity and experience until Time\r\nrobbed them of the latter, and rendered the former a useless ornament;\r\nand dying, he bequeathed them, with the house and lands, to their\r\npresent friend and patron. There they sat in their own hall, royal\r\nservants every one, hanging to life by one small thread, which when\r\nit breaks for one must break for all. They had little interest in\r\nthe present world, to which the daily visit of the doctor, and that\r\nalone, connected them. He never failed to pay it. Unconscious of all\r\nelse, they never failed to look for it.\r\n\r\nThe village clock struck eleven as I walked up the avenue that\r\nconducted to the house. The day was intensely hot, and at that early\r\nhour the fierce fire of the sun had rendered the atmosphere sweltry\r\nand oppressive. I knocked many times before I could obtain admittance,\r\nand, at last, the door was opened by a ragged urchin about twelve\r\nyears of age, looking more like the son of a thief or a gypsy than a\r\njuvenile member of the decent household.\r\n\r\n\"Is Dr. Mayhew at home?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know!\" he answered surlily; \"you had better come and see;\"\r\nand therewith he turned upon his heel, and tramped heavily down the\r\nkitchen stairs. For a few seconds I remained where I was. At length,\r\nhearing no voices in the house, and finding that no one was likely\r\nto come to me, I followed him. At the bottom of the stairs was a\r\nlong passage leading to the offices. It was very dark, or it was\r\nrendered so to me who had just left the glare of noonday. At the end\r\nof it, however, a small lamp glimmered, and under its feeble help I\r\nadvanced. Arriving at its extremity, I was stopped by the hum of many\r\nvoices that proceeded from a chamber on the right. Here I knocked\r\nimmediately. The voice of Dr. Mayhew desired me to enter. The door\r\nwas opened the moment afterwards, and then I beheld the doctor\r\nhimself and every servant of the house assembled in a crowd. The\r\nlittle boy who had given me admission was in the group; and in the\r\nvery centre of all, sitting upright in a chair, was the strangest\r\napparition of a man that I have ever gazed upon, before or since. The\r\nobject that attracted, and at the same time repelled, my notice, was\r\na creature whose age no living man could possibly determine. He was\r\nat least six feet high, with raven hair, and a complexion sallow as\r\nthe sear leaf. Look at his figure, then mark the absence of a single\r\nwrinkle, and you judge him for a youth. Observe again: look at the\r\nemaciated face; note the jet-black eye, deeply-sunken, and void of\r\nall fire and life; the crushed, the vacant, and forlorn expression;\r\nthe aquiline nose, prominent as an eagle's, from which the parchment\r\nskin is drawn as rigidly as though it were a dead man's skin,\r\nbloodless and inert. The wear and tear, the buffeting and misery of\r\nseventy years are there. Seventy!--yea, twice seventy years of mortal\r\nagony and suffering could hardly leave a deeper impress. He is\r\nstrangely clad. He is in rags. The remnants of fine clothes are\r\ndropping from his shrunken body. His hand is white and small. Upon\r\nthe largest finger he wears a ring--once, no doubt, before his hand\r\nhad shrivelled up--the property and ornament of the smallest. It is\r\na sparkling diamond, and it glistens as his own black eye should, if\r\nit be true that he is old only in mental misery and pain. There is\r\nno sign of thought or feeling in his look. His eye falls on no one,\r\nbut seems to pass beyond the lookers-on, and to rest on space. The\r\ncompany are far more agitated. A few minutes before my arrival the\r\nstrange object had been found, with the boy whom I had first seen,\r\nwandering in the garden. He was apprehended for a thief, brought\r\ninto the house, and not until Dr. Mayhew had been summoned, had it\r\nbeen suspected that the poor creature was an idiot. Commiseration\r\nthen took the place of anger quickly, and all was anxiety and desire\r\nto know whence he had come, who he might be, and what his business\r\nwas. He could not speak for himself, and the answers of the boy had\r\nbeen unsatisfactory and vague. When I entered the room, the doctor\r\ngave me a slight recognition, and proceeded at once to a further\r\nexamination of the stripling.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you pick him up, Sir?\" enquired the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Mother sent me out a-begging with him,\" answered the gypsy boy.\r\n\r\n\"Who is your mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mabel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mabel what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mabel nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where does she live, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"She doesn't live nowhere. She's a tramper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is she now?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I tell? We shall pick up somewhere. Let me go, and take\r\nSilly Billy with me. I shall get such a licking if I don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is his name Billy?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Silly Billy, all then chaps as is fools are called Silly Billy.\r\nYou know that, don't you? Oh, I say, do let's go now, there's good\r\nfellows!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a moment, boy--not so fast. How long have you been acquainted\r\nwith this unfortunate?\"\r\n\r\n\"What, Silly Billy? Oh, we ain't very old friends! I only see'd him\r\nyesterday. He came up quite unawares to our camp whilst we were\r\ngrubbing. He seemed very hungry, so mother gave him summut, and made\r\nhim up a bed--and she means to have him. So she sent me out this\r\nmorning a-begging with him, and told me she'd break every gallows\r\nbone I'd got, if I did not bring him back safe. I say, now I have\r\ntold all, let us go--there's a good gentleman! I'm quite glad he is\r\ngoing to live with us. It's so lucky to have a Silly Billy.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is it, you young rascal, you didn't tell me all this before?\r\nWhat do you mean by it?\r\n\r\n\"Why, it isn't no business of your'n. Let us go, will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange,\" said Doctor Mayhew, turning to his butler--\"Strange, that\r\nthey should leave that ring upon his finger--valuable as it looks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you try it on, that's all! Catch mother leaving that there, if\r\nshe could get it off. She tried hard enough, I can tell you and I\r\nthought he'd just have bitten her hand off. Wasn't he savage neither,\r\noh cry! She won't try at it again in a hurry. She says it serves her\r\nright, for no luck comes of robbing a Silly Billy.\"\r\n\r\nThe servants, who betrayed a few minutes before great anxiety and\r\napprehension, were perfectly overcome by this humorous sally, and\r\nburst, with on accord, into the loudest laughter. The generally\r\njocose doctor, however, looked particularly serious, and kept his\r\neye upon the poor idiot with an expression of deep pity. \"Will he\r\nnot speak?\" he asked, still marking his unhappy countenance bereft of\r\nevery sign of sensibility.\r\n\r\n\"He won't say not nuffin,\" said the boy, in a tone which he hoped\r\nwould settle the business; \"You have no right to keep us. Let us go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave me with these persons,\" said the Doctor, turning to the\r\nservants. \"We will see if the tongue of this wretched be really tied.\r\nGo, all of you.\"\r\n\r\nIn an instant the room was left to Doctor Mayhew and myself--the\r\nidiot and his keeper.\r\n\r\n\"What is your name, my man?\" enquired the physician in a soothing\r\ntone. \"Do not be frightened. Nobody will hurt you here. We are all\r\nyour very good friends. Tell me now, what is your name?\"\r\n\r\nThe questioner took the poor fellow at the same time by the hand, and\r\npressed it kindly. The latter then looked round the room with a\r\nvacant stare, and sighed profoundly.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me your name,\" continued the Doctor, encouraged by the movement.\r\nThe lips of the afflicted man unclosed. His brick-red tongue\r\nattempted to moisten them. Fixing his expressionless eyes upon the\r\ndoctor, he answered, in a hollow voice, \"_Belton_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I never!\" exclaimed the boy. \"Them Silly Billies is the\r\ndeceitfulest chaps as is. He made out to mother that he couldn't\r\nspeak a word.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take care what you are about, boy,\" said Doctor Mayhew sternly.\r\n\"I tell you that I suspect you.\" Turning to the idiot, he proceeded.\r\n\"And where do you come from?\"\r\n\r\nThe lips opened again, and the same hollow voice again answered,\r\n\"_Belton_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I understand--that is your name--but whither do you wish to go?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Belton_,\" said the man.\r\n\r\n\"Strange!\" ejaculated the Doctor. \"How old are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Belton_,\" repeated the simple creature, more earnestly than ever.\r\n\r\n\"I am puzzled,\" exclaimed Mr. Mayhew, releasing the hand of the idiot,\r\nand standing for a few seconds in suspense. \"However,\" he continued,\r\n\"upon one thing I am resolved. The man shall be left here, and in my\r\ncare. I will be responsible for his safety until something is done\r\nfor him. We shall certainly get intelligence. He has escaped from an\r\nasylum--I have not the slightest doubt of it--and we shall be able,\r\nafter a few days, to restore him. As for you, sir,\" he added,\r\naddressing the young gypsy, \"make the best of your way to your mother,\r\nand be thankful that you have come so well off--fly.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy began to remonstrate, upon which the doctor began to talk of\r\nthe cage and the horsepond. The former then evinced his good sense\r\nby listening to reason, and by selecting, as many a wiser man has\r\ndone before him--the smaller of two necessary evils. He departed,\r\nnot expressing himself in the most elegant terms that might have\r\nbeen applied to a leave-taking.\r\n\r\nThe benevolent physician soon made arrangements for the comfort of\r\nhis charge. He was immediately placed in a bath, supplied with food,\r\nand dressed in decent clothing. He submitted at once to his treatment,\r\nand permitted his attendant to do what he would with him, taking,\r\nall the while, especial care to feel the diamond ring safe and\r\nsecure under the palm of his own hand. A room was given to him and\r\nRobin, the gardener's son, who was forthwith installed his guardian,\r\nwith strict directions not to leave the patient for an instant by\r\nhimself. When Dr. Mayhew had seen every thing that could be done\r\nproperly executed, he turned cheerfully to me, and bade me follow\r\nhim to his library.\r\n\r\n\"His clothes have been good,\" muttered the doctor to himself, as he\r\nsat down. \"Diamond ring! He is a gentleman, or has been one. Curious\r\nbusiness! Well, we shall have him advertised all round the country\r\nin a day or two. Meanwhile here he is, and will be safe. That\r\ntrouble is over. Now, Stukely, what brings you so early? Any thing\r\nwrong at home? Fairman in the dumps again; fidgety and restless, eh?\"\r\n\r\nI told my errand.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I thought so! There's nothing the matter there, sir. She is\r\nwell enough now, and will continue so, if her father doesn't\r\nfrighten her into sickness, which he may do. I tell you what, I must\r\nget little puss a husband, and take her from him. That will save her.\r\nI have my eye upon a handsome fellow--Hollo, sir, what's the matter\r\nwith you! Just look at your face in that glass. It is as red as fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"The weather, sir, is\"--\r\n\r\n\"Oh, is it? You mean to say, then, that you are acquainted with the\r\ninfluences of the weather. That is just the thing, for you can help\r\nme to a few facts for the little treatise on climate which I have\r\ngot now in hand. Well, go on, my friend. You were saying that the\r\nweather is--is what?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very hot, sir,\" I answered, dreadfully annoyed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, so it is; that's very true but not original. I have heard the\r\nsame remark at least six times this morning. I say, Master Stukely,\r\nyou haven't been casting sheep's-eyes in that sweet quarter, have you?\r\nHaven't, perhaps, been giving the young lady instruction as well as\r\nthe boys--eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand, sir,\" I struggled to say with coolness.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very well!\" answered Dr. Mayhew dryly. \"That's very unfortunate\r\ntoo, for,\" continued he, taking out his watch, \"I haven't time to\r\nexplain myself just now. I have an appointment four miles away in\r\nhalf an hour's time. I am late as it is. Williams will get you some\r\nlunch. Tell Fairman I shall see him before night. Make yourself\r\nperfectly at home, and don't hurry. But excuse me; this affair has\r\nmade me quite behindhand.\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor took a few papers and a book from the table, and before I\r\nhad time to reply, vanished, much to my relief and satisfaction. My\r\njourney homeward was not a happy one. I felt alarm and agitation,\r\nand the beautiful scenery failed to remove or temper them. My\r\nheart's dear secret had been once more discovered. Rumour could not\r\nomit to convey it speedily to the minister himself. In two\r\ndirections the flame had now power to advance and spread; and if the\r\nold villager remained faithful, what reason had I to hope that\r\nDr. Mayhew would not immediately expose me--yes, must not regard it\r\nas his business and duty so to do? Yet one thing was certain. The\r\nsecret, such as it had become, might, for all practical purposes, be\r\nknown to the whole world, for unquestionably the shallowest observer\r\nwas at present able to detect it. The old woman in the village, aged\r\nand ignorant as she was, had been skilful enough to discover it when\r\nI spoke. The doctor had gathered it from my looks even before I\r\nuttered a syllable. What was to hinder the incumbent from reading\r\nthe tale on my forehead the moment that I again stood in his presence?\r\n\r\nReaching the parsonage, I proceeded at once to the drawing-room,\r\nwhere I expected to see the minister. No one was in the room, but a\r\nchair was drawn to the table, and the implements of drawing were\r\nbefore it. Could I not guess who had been the recent tenant of that\r\nhappy chair--who had been busy there? Forgetful of every thing but\r\nher, I stood for a time in silent adoration of the absent one; then\r\nI ventured to approach and gaze upon her handiwork. I shook with joy,\r\nwith ravishment, and ecstasy, when I beheld it. What was not made\r\nknown to me in that one hasty look! What golden dreams did not engage,\r\nwhat blissful triumph did not elevate, what passionate delight did\r\nnot overflow my aching heart! Oh, it was true--and the blessed\r\nintelligence came to me with a power and a reality that no language\r\ncould contain--SHE LOVED ME! she, the beloved, the good, the innocent,\r\nand pure! Before me was the scene--the dearest to me in\r\nlife--through which we had so recently walked together, and upon\r\nwhich she knew I doated, for the sake of her whose presence had\r\ngiven it light and hallowed it. Why had she brought it on the paper?\r\nWhy this particular scene, and that fair hillock, but for the sake\r\nof him who worshipped them--but that the mysterious and communicable\r\nfire had touched her soul, and melted it? I trembled with my\r\nhappiness. There was a spot upon the paper--a tear--one sacred drop\r\nfrom the immaculate fount. Why had it been shed? In joy or pain--for\r\nwhom--and wherefore? The paper was still moist--the tear still warm.\r\nHappiest and most unfortunate of my race, I pressed it to my lips,\r\nand kissed it passionately.\r\n\r\nMiss Fairman entered at that moment.\r\n\r\nShe looked pale and ill. This was not a season for consideration.\r\nBefore I could speak, I saw her tottering, and about to fall. I\r\nrushed to her and held her in my arms. She strove for recovery, and\r\nset herself at liberty; but she wept aloud as she did so, and\r\ncovered her face with her hands. I fell upon my knees, and implored\r\nher to forgive me.\r\n\r\n\"I have been rash and cruel, Miss Fairman, but extend to me your\r\npardon, and I will go for ever, and disturb your peace no more. Do\r\nnot despise me, or believe that I have deliberately interfered with\r\nyour happiness, and destroyed my own for ever. Do not hate me when I\r\nshall see you no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave me, Mr. Stukely, I entreat,\" sobbed Miss Fairman, weeping amain.\r\nHer hand fell. I was inflamed with passion, and I became indifferent\r\nto the claims of duty, which were drowned in the louder clamours of\r\nlove. I seized that hand and held it firm. It needed not, for the\r\nlady sought not to withdraw it.\r\n\r\n\"I am not indifferent to you, dearest Miss Fairman,\" I exclaimed;\r\n\"you do not hate me--you do not despise me--I am sure you do not.\r\nThat drawing has revealed to me all that I wish or care to know. I\r\nwould rather die this moment possessed of that knowledge, than live\r\na monarch without it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave me, leave me, I implore you,\" faltered Miss Fairman.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dearest lady, I must--I shall leave you. I can stay no longer\r\nhere. Life is valueless now. I have permitted a raging fire to\r\nconsume me. I have indulged, madly and fearfully indulged, in error.\r\nI have struggled against the temptation. Heaven has willed that I\r\nshould not escape it. I have learnt that you love me--come what may,\r\nI am content.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you regard me, Mr. Stukely, pity me, and go, now. I beg, I\r\nentreat you to leave me.\"\r\n\r\nI raised the quivering hand, and kissed it ardently. I resigned it,\r\nand departed.\r\n\r\nMy whole youth was a succession of inconsiderate yieldings to passion,\r\nand of hasty visitings of remorse. It is not a matter of surprise\r\nthat I hated myself for every word that I had spoken as soon as I\r\nwas again master of my conduct. It was my nature to fall into error\r\nagainst conviction and my cool reason, and to experience speedily the\r\nreaction that succeeds the commission of exorbitant crimes. In\r\nproportion to the facility with which I erred, was the extravagance\r\nand exaggeration with which I viewed my faults. During the\r\npredominance of a passion, death, surrounded by its terrors, would\r\nnot have frighted me or driven me back--would not have received my\r\npassing notice; whilst it lasted it prevailed. So, afterwards, when\r\nall was calm and over, a crushing sense of wrong and guilt magnified\r\nthe smallest offence, until it grew into a bugbear to scare me night\r\nand day. Leaving Miss Fairman, I rushed into the garden, preparatory\r\nto running away from the parsonage altogether. This, in the height\r\nof remorseful excitement, presented itself to my mind forcibly as\r\nthe necessary and only available step to adopt; but this soon came\r\nto be regarded as open to numerous and powerful objections.\r\n\r\nIt seemed impossible that the incumbent could be kept any longer in\r\nignorance of the affair; and it was better--oh! how much better--for\r\ncomfort and peace of mind that he should not be. In a few hours\r\nDr. Mayhew would arrive, and his shrewd eye would immediately\r\npenetrate to the very seat of his patient's disquietude. The\r\ndiscovery would be communicated to her father--and what would he\r\nthink of me?--what would become of me? I grew as agitated as though\r\nthe doctor were at that moment seated with the minister--and\r\nrevealing to his astounded listener the history of my deceit and\r\nblack ingratitude. The feeling was not to be borne; and in order to\r\ncast it off, I determined myself to be the messenger of the tale,\r\nand to stand the brunt of his first surprise and indignation. With\r\nthe earliest conception of the idea, I ran to put it into execution.\r\nNor did I stop until I reached the door of his study, when the\r\ndifficulty of introducing at once so delicate a business, and the\r\nimportance of a little quiet preparation, suggested themselves,\r\nand made me hesitate. It was however, but for a moment for\r\nself-possession. I would argue with myself no longer. The few hours\r\nthat intervened before the arrival of the doctor were my own and if\r\nI permitted them to pass away, my opportunity was gone for ever, and\r\nevery claim upon the kindness and forgiveness of my patron lost. I\r\nwould confess my affection, and offer him the only reparation in my\r\npower--to quit his roof, and carry the passion with me for my\r\npunishment and torment.\r\n\r\nMr. Fairman was alone. The pupils were playing on the lawn upon\r\nwhich the window of the study opened. There they ran, and leaped, and\r\nshouted, all feeling and enjoyment, without an atom of the leaden\r\ncare of life to press upon the light elastic soul; and there stood I,\r\nyoung enough to be a playmate brother, separated from them and their\r\nhearts' joyousness by the deep broad line which, once traversed, may\r\nnever be recovered, ground to the earth by suffering, trial, and\r\ndisappointment; darkness and discouragement without; misery and\r\nself-upbraiding robbing me of peace within. My eyes caught but a\r\nglimpse of the laughing boys before they settled on the minister,\r\nand summoned me to my ungracious task--and it was a glimpse of a\r\nbright and beautiful world, with which I had nothing in common, of\r\nwhich I had known something, it might be ages since--but whose glory\r\nhad departed even from the memory.\r\n\r\n\"Is he here?\" enquired the incumbent.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor Mahew could not accompany me, sir,\" I answered, \"but he will\r\nshortly come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Stukely, thank you. I have good news for you. I can\r\nafford you time to recruit and be yourself again. The lads return\r\nhome on Monday next; you shall have a month's holiday, and you shall\r\nspend it as you will--with us, or elsewhere. If your health will be\r\nimproved by travelling, I shall be happy to provide you with the\r\nmeans. I cannot afford to lose your services. You must not get ill.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very kind, sir,\" I replied--\"kinder than I deserve.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a matter of opinion, Stukely. I do not think so. You have\r\nserved me faithfully and well. I consult my own interest in rewarding\r\nyou and taking care of yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir--but\"--\r\n\r\n\"Well, never mind now. We will not argue on whose side the obligation\r\nlies. It is perhaps well that we should both of us think as we do. It\r\nis likely that we shall both perform our duty more strictly if we\r\nstrike the balance against ourselves. Go and refresh yourself. You\r\nlook tired and worn. Get a glass of wine, and cheer up. Have you\r\nseen Miss Fairman?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is concerning her, sir,\" I answered, trembling in every joint,\r\n\"that I desire particularly to speak to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heaven!\" exclaimed the incumbent, starting from his chair,\r\n\"what do you mean? What is the matter? What has happened? Why do you\r\ntremble, Stukely, and look so ghastly pale? What has happened since\r\nthe morning? What ails her? Go on. Speak. Tell me at once. My poor\r\nchild--what of her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Calm yourself, I implore you, sir. Miss Fairman is quite well.\r\nNothing has happened. Do not distress yourself. I have done very\r\nwrong to speak so indiscreetly. Pardon me, sir. I should have known\r\nbetter. She is well.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fairman paced the room in perturbation, and held his hand upon\r\nhis heart to allay its heavy throbs.\r\n\r\n\"This is very wrong,\" he said--\"very impious. I have thought of\r\nnothing else this day--and this is the consequence. I have dwelt\r\nupon the probability of calamity, until I have persuaded myself of\r\nits actual presence--looked for woe, until I have created it. This\r\nis not the patience and resignation which I teach; for shame, for\r\nshame!--go to thy closet, worm--repent and pray.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fairman resumed his seat, and hid his face for a time in his\r\nhands. At length he spoke again.\r\n\r\n\"Proceed, Stukely. I am calm now. The thoughts and fears in which it\r\nwas most sinfull to indulge, and which accumulated in this most\r\nanxious breast, are dissipated. What would you say? I can listen as I\r\nought.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad, sir, that the boys revisit their homes on Monday, and\r\nthat a month, at least, will elapse before their return to you. In\r\nthat interval, you will have an opportunity of providing them with a\r\nteacher worthier your regard and confidence; and, if I leave you at\r\nonce, you will not be put to inconvenience.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must resign my office, sir,\" I said with trepidation.\r\n\r\n\"Resign? Wherefore? What have I said or done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me beg your attention, sir, whilst I attempt to explain my\r\nmotives, and to do justice to myself and you. I mentioned the name\r\nof Miss Fairman.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did. Ha! Go on, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You cannot blame me, Mr. Fairman, if I tell you that, in common\r\nwith every one whose happiness it is to be acquainted with that lady,\r\nI have not been insensible to the qualities which render her so\r\nworthy of your love, so deserving the esteem\"--I stopped.\r\n\r\n\"I am listening, sir--proceed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know not how to tell you, sir, in what language to express the\r\ngrowth of an attachment which has taken root in this poor heart,\r\nincreased and strengthened against every effort which I have made to\r\ncrush it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir!\" uttered the incumbent in great amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Do not be angry, Mr. Fairman, until you have heard all. I confess\r\nthat I have been imprudent and rash, that I have foolishly permitted\r\na passion to take possession of my heart, instead of manfully\r\nresisting its inroads; but if I have been weak, do not believe that\r\nI have been wicked.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak plainly, Stukely. What am I to understand by this?\"\r\n\r\n\"That I have dared, sir, to indulge a fond, a hopeless love,\r\ninspired by the gentlest and most innocent of her sex--that I have\r\nstriven, and striven, to forget and flee from it--that I have\r\nfailed--that I come to confess the fault, to ask your pardon, and\r\ndepart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me one thing,\" asked the incumbent quickly. \"Have you\r\ncommunicated your sentiments to Miss Fairman?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is her illness connected with that declaration?--You do not answer.\r\nStukely, I am deceived in you. I mistrust and doubt you. You have\r\n_murdered_ my poor child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Fairman, do not, I entreat\"--\r\n\r\n\"Heaven have mercy upon me for my wild uncrucified temper. I will\r\nuse no harsh terms. I retract that expression, young man. I am sorry\r\nthat I used it. Let me know what more you have to say.\"\r\n\r\nThe tears came to my eyes, and blinded them. I did not answer.\r\n\r\n\"Be seated, Stukely,\" continued the minister, in a kinder tone;\r\n\"compose yourself. I am to blame for using such a term. Forgive me\r\nfor it--I did not mean all that it conveyed. But you know how\r\nfragile and how delicate a plant is that. You should have thought of\r\nher and me before you gratified a passion as wild as it is idle. Now,\r\ntell me every thing. Conceal and disguise nothing. I will listen to\r\nyour calmly, and I will be indulgent. The past is not to be recalled.\r\nAid me in the future, if you are generous and just.\"\r\n\r\nI related all that had passed between Miss Fairman and myself--all\r\nthat had taken place in my own turbulent soul--the battlings of the\r\nwill and judgment, the determination to overcome temptation, and the\r\nsudden and violent yielding to it. Faithful to his command, I\r\nconcealed nothing, and, at the close of all, I signified my readiness,\r\nmy wish, and my intention to depart.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me, sir, at parting,\" said I, \"and you shall hear no more of\r\nthe disturber of your peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not wish that, Stukely. I am indebted to you for the candour\r\nwith which you have spoken, and the proper view which you take of\r\nyour position. I wish to hear of you, and to serve you--and I will\r\ndo it. I agree with you, that you must leave us now--yes, and at once;\r\nand, as you say, without another interview. But I will not turn you\r\ninto the world, lad, without some provision for the present, and\r\ngood hopes for the future. I owe you much. Yes--very much. When I\r\nconsider how differently you might behave, how very seriously you\r\nmight interfere with my happiness\"--as Mr. Fairman spoke, he opened\r\nthe drawer of a table, and drew a checque-book from it--\"I feel that\r\nyou ought not to be a loser by your honesty. I do not offer you this\r\nas a reward for that honesty--far from it--I would only indemnify\r\nyou--and this is my duty.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fairman placed a draft for a hundred pounds in my hand.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, sir,\" said I, replacing it on his table. \"I can take no\r\nmoney. Millions could not _indemnify_ me for all that I resign.\r\nJudge charitably, and think kindly of me, sir--and I am paid. Honour\r\nis priceless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, but when you get to London?\"--\r\n\r\n\"I am not altogether friendless. My salary is yet untouched, and will\r\nsupply my wants until I find employment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which you shall not be long without, believe me, Stukely, if I have\r\npower to get it you--and I think I have. You will tell me where I may\r\naddress my letters. I will not desert you. You shall not repent this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not, sir; and I believe I never shall. I propose to leave the\r\nparsonage to-night, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, to-morrow, we must have some talk. You need not see her. I\r\ncould not let you go to-night. You shall depart to-morrow, and I rely\r\nupon your good sense and honourable feelings to avoid another meeting.\r\nIt could only increase the mischief that has already taken place, and\r\nanswer no good purpose. You must be aware of this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am, sir. You shall have no reason to complain.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure of it, Stukely. You had better see about your preparations.\r\nJohn will help you in any way you wish. Make use of him. There must\r\nbe many little things to do. There can be no impropriety, Stukely,\r\nin your accepting the whole of your year's salary. You are entitled\r\nto that. I am sorry to lose you--very--but there's no help for it. I\r\nwill come to your room this evening, and have some further\r\nconversation. Leave me now.\" The incumbent was evidently much excited.\r\nLove for his child, and apprehension for her safety, were feelings\r\nthat were, perhaps, too prominent and apparent in the good and\r\nfaithful minister of heaven; they betrayed him at times into a\r\nself-forgetfulness, and a warmth of expression, of which he repented\r\nheartily as soon as they occurred. Originally of a violent and\r\nwayward disposition, it had cost the continual exercise and the\r\nprayers of a life, to acquire evenness of temper and gentleness of\r\ndeportment, neither of which, in truth, was easily, if ever disturbed,\r\nif not by the amiable infirmity above alluded to. He was the best of\r\nmen; but to the best, immunity from the natural weakness of\r\nmortality is not to be vouchsafed.\r\n\r\nMr. Fairman was the last person whom I saw that night. He remained\r\nwith me until I retired to rest. He was the first person whom I saw\r\non the following morning. I do not believe that he did not rely upon\r\nthe word which I had pledged to him. I did not suppose that he\r\nsuspected my resolution, but I an convinced that he was most\r\nrestless and unhappy, from the moment that I revealed my passion to\r\nhim, until that which saw me safely deposited at the foot of the hill,\r\non my way to the village. So long as I remained in his house, he\r\ncould only see danger for his daughter; and with my disappearance he\r\ncounted upon her recovery and peace.\r\n\r\nThe incumbent was himself my companion from the parsonage. The\r\nservant had already carried my trunk to the inn. At the bottom of\r\nthe hill, Mr. Fairman stopped and extended his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Fare-you-well, Stukely,\" said he, with emotion. \"Once more, I am\r\nobliged to you. I will never forget your conduct; you shall hear\r\nfrom me.\"\r\n\r\nSince the conversation of the preceding day, the incumbent had not\r\nmentioned the name of his daughter. I had not spoken of her. I felt\r\nit impossible to _part_ without a word.\r\n\r\n\"What did Doctor Mayhew say?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"She is a little better, and will be soon quite well, we trust.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is good news. Is she composed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--she is better.\"\r\n\r\n\"One question more, sir. Does she know of my departure?\"\r\n\r\n\"She does not--but she will, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not speak unkindly of me to her, sir. I should be sorry if she\r\nthought ill\"--\r\n\r\n\"She will respect you, Stukely, for the part which you have acted.\r\nShe must do so. You will respect yourself.\"\r\n\r\nI had nothing more to say, I returned his warm pressure, and bade\r\nhim farewell.\r\n\r\n\"God bless you, lad, and prosper you! We may meet again in a happier\r\nseason; but if we do not, receive a father's thanks and gratitude.\r\nYou have behaved nobly. I feel it--believe me.\"\r\n\r\nManly and generous tears rushed to the eyes of my venerable friend,\r\nand he could not speak. Once more he grasped my hand fervently, and\r\nin the saddest silence that I have ever known we separated.\r\n\r\nThere was gloom around my heart, which the bright sun in heaven, that\r\ngladdened all the land, could not penetrate or disperse; but it gave\r\nway before a touch of true affection, which came to me as a last\r\nmemorial of the beloved scene on which I lingered.\r\n\r\nI had hardly parted from the minister, before I perceived walking\r\nbefore me, at the distance of a few yards, the youngest of the lads\r\nwho had been my pupils. At the request of the minister, I had\r\nneither taken leave of them nor informed any one of my departure.\r\nThe lad whom I now saw was a fine spirited boy, who had strongly\r\nattached himself to me, and shown great aptitude, as well as deep\r\ndesire, for knowledge. He knew very little when I came to him, but\r\ngreat pains had enabled him to advance rapidly. The interest which\r\nhe manifested, called forth in me a corresponding disposition to\r\nassist him; and the grateful boy, altogether overlooking his own\r\nexertions, had over and over again expressed himself in the warmest\r\nterms of thankfulness for my instruction, to which he insisted he\r\nowed all that he had acquired. He was in his eleventh year, and his\r\nheart was as kind and generous as his intellect was vigorous and\r\nclear. I came up to him, and found him plucking the wild-flowers\r\nfrom the grass as he wandered slowly along. I looked at him as I\r\npassed, and found him weeping.\r\n\r\n\"Alfred!\" I exclaimed, \"What do you here so early?\"\r\n\r\nThe boy burst into a fresh flow of tears, and threw himself\r\npassionately into my arms. He sobbed piteously, and at length said--\r\n\r\n\"Do not go, sir--do not leave me! You have been so kind to me. Pray,\r\nstop.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter Alfred?\"\r\n\r\n\"John has told me you are going, sir. He has just taken your box down.\r\nOh, Mr. Stukely, stay for my sake! I won't give you so much trouble\r\nas I used to do. I'll learn my lessons better--but don't go, pray,\r\nsir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will have another teacher, Alfred, who will become as good a\r\nfriend as I am. I cannot stay. Return to the parsonage--there's a\r\ndear boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if you must go, let me walk with you a little, sir! Let me take\r\nyour hand. I shall be back in time for breakfast--pray, don't refuse\r\nme that, sir?\"\r\n\r\nI complied with his request. He grasped my palm in both his hands,\r\nand held it there, as though he would not part with it again. He\r\ngave me the flowers which he had gathered, and begged me to keep\r\nthem for his sake. He repeated every kind thing which I had done for\r\nhim, not one of which he would forget, and all the names and dates\r\nwhich he had got by heart, to please his tutor. He told me that it\r\nwould make him wretched, \"to get up to-morrow, and remember that I\r\nwas gone;\" and that he loved me better than any body, for no one had\r\nbeen so indulgent, and had taken such pains to make him a good boy.\r\nBefore we reached the village, his volubility had changed the tears\r\nto smiles. As we reached it, John appeared on his return homeward. I\r\ngave the boy into his charge, and the cloud lowered again, and the\r\nshower fell heavier than ever. I turned at the point at which the\r\nhills became shut out, and there stood the boy fastened to the spot\r\nat which I had left him.\r\n\r\nAt the door of the inn, I was surprised to find my luggage in the\r\ncustody of Dr. Mayhew's gardener. As soon as he perceived me, he\r\nadvanced a few steps with the box, and placed note in my hand. It\r\nwas addressed to me at the parsonage, and politely requested me to\r\nwait upon the physician at my earliest convenience. No mention was\r\nmade of the object of my visit, or of the doctor's knowledge of my\r\naltered state. The document was as short as it might be, and as\r\ncourteous. Having read it, I turned to the gardener, or to where he\r\nhad stood a moment before, with the view of questioning that\r\ngentleman; but to my great astonishment, I perceived him about a\r\nhundred yards before me, walking as fast as his load permitted him\r\ntowards his master's residence. I called loudly after him, but my\r\nvoice only acted as a spur, and increased his pace. My natural\r\nimpulse was to follow him, and I obeyed it.\r\n\r\nDr. Mayhew received me with a very cunning smile and a facetious\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Master Stukely, this hot weather has been playing the deuce\r\nwith us all. Only think of little puss being attacked with your\r\ncomplaint, the very day you were here suffering so much from it, and\r\nmy getting a touch myself.\"\r\n\r\nI smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, it is very easy to laugh at the troubles of other men,\r\nbut I can tell you this is a very disagreeable epidemic. Severe\r\ntimes these for maids and bachelors. I shall settle in life now,\r\nsooner than I intended. I have fallen in love with puss my self.\"\r\n\r\nI did not smile.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure, I am old enough to be her father, but so much the better\r\nfor her. No man should marry till fifty. Your young fellows of twenty\r\ndon't know their own mind--don't understand what love means--all\r\nblaze and flash, blue fire and sky-rocket--out in a minute. Eh, what\r\ndo you say, Stukely?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you aware, sir, that I have left the parsonage?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure I am; and a pretty kettle of fish you have made of it.\r\nInstead of treating love as a quiet and respectable undertaking, as\r\nI mean to treat it--instead of simmering your love down to a\r\ngentlemanly respect and esteem, as I mean to simmer it--and waiting\r\npatiently for the natural consequences of things, as I mean to\r\nwait--you must, like a boy as you are, have it all out in a minute,\r\nset the whole house by the ears, and throw yourself out of it\r\nwithout rhyme or reason, or profit to any body. Now, sit down, and\r\ntell me what you mean to do with yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"I intend to go to London, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does your father live there?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no father, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--your mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is dead, too. I have one friend there--I shall go to him until\r\nI find occupation.\"\r\n\r\n\"You naughty boy! How I should like to whip you! What right had you\r\nto give away so good a chance as you have had? You have committed a\r\nsin, sir--yes, you may look--you have, and a very grievous one. I\r\nspeak as I think. You have been flying in the face of Providence, and\r\ndoing worse than hiding the talent which was bestowed upon you for\r\nimprovement. Do you think I should have behaved so at your age? Do\r\nyou think any man in the last generation out of a madhouse would have\r\ndone it? Here's your march of education!\"\r\n\r\nI bowed to Doctor Mayhew, and wished him good-morning.\r\n\r\n\"No, thank you, sir,\" answered the physician, \"if I didn't mean to\r\nsay a little more to you, I shouldn't have spoken so much already. We\r\nmust talk these matters over quietly. You may as well stay a few\r\ndays with your friend in the country as run off directly to the\r\ngentleman in London. Besides, now I have made my mind up so suddenly\r\nto get married, I don't know soon I may be called upon to undergo\r\nthe operation--I beg the lady's pardon--the awful ceremony. I shall\r\nwant a bride's-man, and you wouldn't make a bad one by any means.\"\r\n\r\nThe physician rang the bell, and Williams the butler--a personage in\r\nblack, short and stout, and exceedingly well fed, as his sleek face\r\nshowed--entered the apartment.\r\n\r\n\"Will you see, Williams, that Mr. Stukely's portmanteau is taken to\r\nhis room--bed quite aired--sheets all right, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Both baked, sir,\" replied Williams with a deferential but expressive\r\nsmile, which became his face remarkably well.\r\n\r\n\"Then let us have lunch, Williams, and a bottle of _the_ sherry?\"\r\n\r\nA look accompanied the request, which was not lost upon the butler.\r\nHe made a profound obeisance, and retired. At lunch the doctor\r\ncontinued his theme, and represented my conduct as most blameable\r\nand improper. He insisted that I ought to be severely punished, and\r\nmade to feel that a boy is not to indulge every foolish feeling that\r\nrises, just as he thinks proper, but, like an inconsistent judge, he\r\nconcluded the whole of a very powerful and angry summing up, by\r\npronouncing upon me the verdict of an acquittal--inasmuch as he told\r\nme to make myself as comfortable as I could in his house, and to\r\nenjoy myself thoroughly in it for the next fortnight to come, at the\r\nvery least. It may have been that, in considering my faults as those\r\nof the degenerate age in which I lived--which age, however, be it\r\nknown, lived afterwards to recover its character, and to be held up\r\nas a model of propriety and virtue to the succeeding generation--the\r\nmerciful doctor was willing to merge my chastisement in that which\r\nhe bestowed daily upon the unfortunate object of his contempt and\r\npity, or possibly he desired to inflict no punishment at all, but\r\nsimply to perform a duty incumbent upon his years and station. Be\r\nthis as it may, certain it is that with the luncheon ended all\r\nupbraiding and rebuke, and commenced an unreservedness of\r\nintercourse--the basis of a generous friendship, which increased and\r\nstrengthened day by day, and ended only with the noble-hearted\r\ndoctor's life--nor then in its effects upon my character and fortune.\r\n\r\nIt was on the night of the day on which I had arrived, that Doctor\r\nMayhew and I were sitting in his _sanctum_; composedly and happily as\r\nmen sit whom care has given over for a moment to the profound and\r\nstilly influences of the home and hearth. One topic of conversation\r\nhad given place easily to another, and there seemed at length little\r\nto be said on any subject whatever, when the case of the idiot,\r\nwhich my own troubles had temporarily dismissed from my mind,\r\nsuddenly occurred to me, and afforded us motive for the prolongation\r\nof a discourse, which neither seemed desirous to bring to a close.\r\n\r\n\"What have you done with the poor fellow?\" I enquired.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" replied the physician. \"We have fed him well, and his food\r\nhas done him good. He is a hundred per cent better than when he came;\r\nbut he is still surly and tongue-tied. He says nothing. He is not\r\nknown in the neighbourhood. I have directed hand-bills to be\r\ncirculated, and placards to be posted in the villages. If he is not\r\nowned within a week, he must be given to the parish-officers. I\r\ncan't help thinking that he is a runaway lunatic, and a gentleman by\r\nbirth. Did you notice his delicate white hand, that diamond ring, and\r\nthe picture they found tied round his neck?\"\r\n\r\n\"What picture, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did I not tell you of it? The portrait of a lovely female--an old\r\nattachment, I suppose, that turned his brain, although I fancy\r\nsometimes that it is his mother or sister, for there is certainly a\r\nresemblance to himself in it. The picture is set in gold. When Robin\r\nfirst discovered it, the agony of the stricken wretch was most\r\ndeplorable. He was afraid that the man would remove it, and he\r\nscreamed and implored like a true maniac. When he found that he\r\nmight keep it, he evinced the maddest pleasure, and beckoned his\r\nkeeper to notice and admire it. He pointed to the eyes, and then\r\ngroaned and wept himself; until Robin was frightened out of his wits,\r\nand was on the point of throwing up his office altogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think the man may recover his reason?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no hope of it. It is a case of confirmed fatuity I believe.\r\nIf you like to see him again, you shall accompany me to-morrow when\r\nI visit him. What a strange life is this, Stukely! What a strange\r\nhistory may be that of this poor fellow whom Providence has cast at\r\nour door! Well, poor wretch, we'll do the best we can for him. If we\r\ncannot reach his mind, we may improve his body, and he will be then\r\nperhaps quite as happy as the wisest of us.\"\r\n\r\nThe clock struck twelve as Doctor Mayhew spoke. It startled and\r\nsurprised us both. In a few minutes we separated and retired to our\r\nseveral beds.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw the idiot on the following day, I could perceive a marked\r\nimprovement in his appearance. The deadly pallor of his countenance\r\nhad departed; and although no healthy colour had taken its place,\r\nthe living blood seemed again in motion, restoring expression to\r\nthose wan and withered features. His coal-black eye had recovered\r\nthe faintest power of speculation, and the presence of a stranger\r\nwas now sufficient to call it into action. He was clean and properly\r\nattired, and he sat--apart from his keeper--conscious of existence.\r\nThere was good ground, in the absence of all positive proof, for the\r\nsupposition of the doctor. A common observer would have pronounced\r\nhim well-born at a glance. Smitten as he was, and unhinged by his sad\r\naffliction, there remained still sufficient of the external forms to\r\nconduct to such an inference. Gracefulness still hovered about the\r\nhuman ruin, discernible in the most aimless of imbecility's weak\r\nmovements, and the limbs were not those of one accustomed to the\r\ndrudgery of life. A melancholy creature truly did he look, as I gazed\r\nupon him for a second time. He had carried his chair to a corner of\r\nthe room, and there he sat, his face half-hidden, resting upon his\r\nbreast, his knee drawn up and pressed tightly by his clasped\r\nhands--those very hands, small and marble-white, forming a ghastful\r\ncontrast to the raven hair that fell thickly on his back. He had not\r\nspoken since he rose. Indeed, since his first appearance, he had said\r\nnothing but the unintelligible word which he had uttered four times\r\nin my presence, and which Dr. Mayhew now believed to be the name of\r\nthe lady whose portrait he wore. That he could speak was certain,\r\nand his silence was therefore the effect of obstinacy or of absolute\r\nweakness of intellect, which forbade the smallest mental effort. I\r\napproached him, and addressed him in accents of kindness. He raised\r\nhis head slowly, and looked piteously upon me, but in a moment again\r\nhe resumed his original position.\r\n\r\nFor the space of a week I visited the afflicted man dally, remaining\r\nwith him perhaps a couple of hours at each interview. No clue had\r\nbeen discovered to his history, and the worthy physician had fixed\r\nupon one day after another as that upon which he would relieve\r\nhimself of his trust; but the day arrived only to find him unwilling\r\nto keep his word. The poor object himself had improved rapidly in\r\npersonal appearance, and, as far as could be ascertained from his\r\ngestures and indistinct expressions, was sensible of his protector's\r\ncharity, and thankful for it. He now attempted to give to his keeper\r\nthe feeble aid he could afford him; he partook of his food with less\r\navidity, he seemed aware of what was taking place around him. On one\r\noccasion I brought his dinner to him, and sat by whilst it was served\r\nto him. He stared at me as though he had immediate perception of\r\nsomething unusual. It was on the same day that, whilst trifling with\r\na piece of broken glass, he cut his hand. I closed the wound with an\r\nadhesive plaster, and bound it up. It was the remembrance of this\r\nact that gained for me the affection of the creature, in whom all\r\nactions seemed dried up and dead. When, on the day that succeeded to\r\nthis incident, Robin, as was his custom, placed before the idiot his\r\nsubstantial meal, the latter turned away from it offended, and would\r\nnot taste it. I was sent for. The eyes of the imbecile glistened\r\nwhen I entered the apartment, and he beckoned me to him. I sat at\r\nhis side, as I had done on the day before, and he then, with a smile\r\nof triumph, took his food on his knees, and soon devoured it. When\r\nhe had finished, and Robin had retired with the tray and implements,\r\nthe poor fellow made me draw my chair still nearer to his own. He\r\nplaced his hand upon my knee in great delight, patted it, and then\r\nthe wound which I had dressed. There was perfect folly in the mode\r\nin which he fondled this, and yet a reasonableness which the heart\r\ncould not fail to detect and contemplate with emotion. First, he\r\ngently stroked it, then placed his head upon it in utmost tenderness,\r\nthen hugged it in his arm and rocked it as a child, then kissed it\r\noften with short quick kisses that could scarce be heard; courting\r\nmy observation with every change of action, making it apparent how\r\nmuch he loved, what care he could bestow, upon the hand which had\r\nwon the notice and regard of his new friend and benefactor. This over,\r\nhe pointed to his breast, dallied for a time, and then drew from it\r\nthe picture which he so jealously carried there. He pressed it\r\nbetween his hands, sighed heavily from his care-crazed heart, and\r\nstrove to tell his meaning in words which would not flow, in which\r\nhe knew not how to breathe the bubble-thought that danced about his\r\nbrain. Closer than ever he approached me, and, with an air which he\r\nintended for one of confidence and great regard, he invited me to\r\nlook upon his treasure. I did so, and, to my astonishment and\r\nterror--gazed upon the portrait of the unhappy EMMA HARRINGTON.\r\nGracious God! what thoughts came rushing into my mind! It was\r\nimpossible to err. I, who had passionately dwelt upon those\r\nlineaments in all the fondness of a devoted love, until the form\r\nbecame my heart's companion by day and night--I, who had watched the\r\nteardrops falling from those eyes, in which the limner had not\r\nfailed to fix the natural sorrow that was a part of them--watched\r\nand hung upon them in distress and agony--I, surely I, could not\r\nmistake the faithful likeness. Who, then, was _he_ that wore it? Who\r\nwas this, now standing at my side, to turn to whom again became\r\nimmediately--sickness--horror! Who could it be but him, the miserable\r\nparricide--the outcast--the unhappy brother--the desperately wicked\r\nson! There was no other in the world to whom the departed penitent\r\ncould be dear; and he--oh, was it difficult to suppose that merciful\r\nHeaven, merciful to the guiltiest, had placed between his conscience\r\nand his horrible offence a cloud that made all dim--had rendered his\r\nunderstanding powerless to comprehend a crime which reason must have\r\npunished and aggravated endlessly My judgment was prostrated by what\r\nI learned so suddenly and fearfully. The discovery had been\r\nmiraculous. What should I do? How proceed? How had the youth got here?\r\nWhat had been his history since his flight? Whither was he wandering?\r\nDid he know the fate of his poor sister? How had he lived? These\r\nquestions, and others, crowded into my mind one after another, and I\r\ntrembled with the violent rapidity of thought. The figure of the\r\nunhappy girl presented itself--her words vibrated on my ears--her\r\nlast dying accents; and I felt that to me was consigned the wretched\r\nobject of her solicitude and love--that to me Providence had\r\ndirected the miserable man; yes, if only that he who had shared in\r\nthe family guilt, might behold and profit by the living witness of\r\nthe household wreck. Half forgetful of the presence of the brother,\r\nand remembering nothing well but _her_ and her most pitiable tale,\r\noppressed by a hundred recollections, I pronounced her name.\r\n\r\n\"Poor, poor, much-tried Emma!\" I ejaculated, gazing still upon her\r\nimage. The idiot leaped from my side at the word, and clapped his\r\nhands, and laughed and shrieked. He ran to me again, and seized my\r\npalm, and pressed it to his lips. His excitement was unbounded. He\r\ncould only point to the picture, endeavour to repeat the word which\r\nI had spoken, and direct his finger to my lips beseechingly, as\r\nthough he _prayed_ to hear the sound again. Alarmed already at what\r\nI had done, and dreading the consequences of a disclosure, because\r\nignorant of the effect it would produce upon the idiot, I checked\r\nmyself immediately, and spake no more. Robin returned. I contrived\r\nto subdue by degrees the sudden ebullition, and having succeeded, I\r\nrestored the criminal to his keeper, and departed.\r\n\r\nIt was however, necessary that I should act in some way, possessed of\r\nthe information which had so strangely come to me. I desired to be\r\nalone to collect myself, and to determine quietly. I retired to my\r\nbedroom, endeavoured to think composedly, and to mark out the line\r\nof duty. It was a fruitless undertaking. My mind would rest on\r\nnothing but the tragedy in which this miserable creature held so sad\r\na part, and his unlooked-for resuscitation here--here, under the\r\nroof which sheltered his sister's paramour. Whether to keep the\r\nsecret hidden in my bosom, or to communicate it to the physician,\r\nwas my duty, I could not settle now. It had been a parting injunction\r\nof my friend Thompson to sleep upon all matters of difficulty, and\r\nto avoid rashness above all things. Alas! I had not profited by his\r\ncounsel, nor, in my own case, recurred to it, even for a moment; but\r\nit was different now. The fate, perhaps the life, of another was\r\ninvolved in my decision; and not to act upon the good advice, not to\r\nbe temperate and cautious, would be sinful in the extreme. What, had\r\nshe been alive, would the sister have required--entreated at my hands?\r\nAnd now, if the freed spirit of the injured one looked down upon the\r\nworld, what would it expect from him to whom had been committed the\r\nforlorn and stricken wanderer? What if not justice, charity, and\r\nmercy? \"And he shall have it!\" I exclaimed. \"I will act on his behalf.\r\nI will be cool and calm. I will do nothing until tomorrow, when the\r\nexcitement of this hour shall have passed away, and reason resumed\r\nits proper influence and rule.\"\r\n\r\nI rose, contented with my conclusion, and walked to the window, which\r\noverlooked the pleasure-garden of the house. Robin and his patient\r\nwere there; the former sitting on a garden chair, and reposing\r\ncomfortably after his meal, heedless of the doings of his charge.\r\nThe latter stood immediately below the window, gazing upwards, with\r\nthe portrait as before pressed between his marble hands. He perceived\r\nme, and screamed in triumph and delight. The keeper started up; I\r\nvanished instantly. He surely could not have known the situation of\r\nmy room--could not have waited there and watched for my appearance.\r\nIt was impossible. Yes, I said so, and I attempted to console myself\r\nwith the assurance; but my blood curdled with a new conviction that\r\narose and clung to me, and would not be cast off--the certainty that,\r\nby the utterance of one word, I had, for good or ill, linked to my\r\nfuture destiny the reasonless and wretched being, who stood and\r\nshrieked beneath the casement long after I was gone.\r\n\r\nI joined my friend, the doctor, as usual in the evening, and learnt\r\nfrom him the news of the day. He had visited his patient at the\r\nparsonage, and he spoke favourably of her case. Although she had\r\nbeen told of my absence, she was still not aware that I had quitted\r\nthe house for ever. Her father thought she was less unquiet, and\r\nbelieved that in a few days all would be forgotten, and she would be\r\nherself again. Doctor Mayhew assured me that nothing could be kinder\r\nthan the manner in which the incumbent spoke of me, and that it was\r\nimpossible for any man to feel a favour more deeply than he appeared\r\nto appreciate the consideration which I had shown for him. The\r\ndoctor had been silent as to my actual presence in the vicinity,\r\nwhich, he believed, to have mentioned, would have been to fill the\r\nanxious father's heart with alarms and fears, which, groundless as\r\nthey were, might be productive of no little mischief. I acquiesced\r\nin the propriety of his silence, and thanked him for his prudence.\r\nWhilst my friend was speaking, I heard a quick and heavy footstep\r\non the stairs, which, causing me to start upon the instant, and\r\nhurling sickness to my heart, clearly told, had doubt existed,\r\nhow strongly apprehension had fixed itself upon me, and how\r\ncertainly and inextricably I had become connected with the object\r\nof my dark and irresistible conceptions. I had no longer an ear for\r\nDoctor Mayhew, but the sense followed the footstep until it reached\r\nthe topmost stair--passed along the passage--and stopped--suddenly\r\nat our door. Almost before it stopped, the door was knocked at\r\nviolently--quickly--loudly. Before an answer could be given, the\r\ndoor itself was opened, and Robin rushed in--scared.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" I exclaimed, jumping up, and dreading to hear\r\nhim tell what I felt must come--another tale of horror--another\r\ncrime--what less than _self-destruction_?\r\n\r\n\"He's gone, sir--he's gone!\" roared the fellow, white as death, and\r\nshaking like an aspen.\r\n\r\n\"Gone--how--who?\" enquired the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"The madman, sir,\" answered Robin, opening his mouth, and raising\r\nhis eyebrows, to exhibit his own praiseworthy astonishment at the\r\nfact.\r\n\r\n\"Go on, man,\" said the doctor. \"What have you to say further? How\r\ndid it happen? Quick!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, sir. I eat something for dinner as disagreed. I have\r\nbeen as sleepy as an owl ever since. We was together in his room,\r\nand I just sot down for a minute to think what it could be as I\r\n_had_ eaten, when I dozed off directly--and when I opened my eyes\r\nagain, not quite a minute arterwards, I couldn't find him\r\nnowheres--and nobody can't neither, and we've been searching the\r\nhouse for the last half hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Foolish fellow--how long was this ago?\"\r\n\r\n\"About an hour, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor said not another word, but taking a candle from the table,\r\nquitted the room, and hurried down stairs. I followed him, and Robin,\r\nalmost frightened out of his wits, trod upon my heel and rubbed\r\nagainst my coat, in his eagerness not to be left behind me. The\r\nestablishment was, as it is said, at sixes and sevens. All was\r\ndisorder and confusion, and hustling into the most remote corner of\r\nthe common room. Mr. Williams especially was very much unsettled. He\r\nstood in the rear of every body else, and looked deathly white. It\r\nwas he who ejaculated something upon the sudden entrance of his\r\nmaster, and was the cause of all the other ejaculations which\r\nfollowed quickly from every member of the household. Doctor Mayhew\r\ncommanded order, and was not long in bringing it about. The house\r\nwas searched immediately Wherever it was supposed that the idiot\r\nmight hide himself, diligent enquiry was made; cupboards, holes,\r\ncorners, and cellars. It was in vain. He certainly had escaped. The\r\ngardens and paddocks, and fields adjacent were scoured, and with like\r\nsuccess. There was no doubt of it--the idiot was gone--who could tell\r\nwhither? After two hours' unprofitable labour, Doctor Mayhew was\r\nagain in his library, very much disturbed in mind, and reproaching\r\nhimself bitterly for his procrastination. \"Had I acted,\" said he,\r\n\"upon my first determination, this would never have happened, and my\r\npart in the business would have been faithfully performed. As it is,\r\nif any mischief should come to that man, I shall never cease to\r\nblame myself, and to be considered the immediate cause of it.\" I made\r\nno reply. I _could_ say nothing. His escape occurring so soon after\r\nmy identification of the unfortunate creature, had bewildered and\r\nconfounded me. I could not guess at the motive of his flight, nor\r\nconceive a purpose to which it was likely the roused maniac would\r\naspire; but I was satisfied--yes, too satisfied, for to think of it\r\nwas to chill and freeze the heart's warm blood--that the revelation\r\nof the day and his removal were in close connexion. Alas, I dared\r\nnot speak, although my fears distracted me whilst I continued dumb!\r\nArrangements were at last made for watching both within and without\r\nthe house during the night--messengers were dispatched to the\r\ncontiguous villages, and all that could be done for the recovery of\r\nthe runaway was attempted. It was already past twelve o'clock when\r\nDr. Mayhew insisted upon my retiring to rest. I did not oppose his\r\nwish. He was ill at ease, and angry with himself. Maintaining the\r\nsilence which I had kept during the evening, I gave him my hand, and\r\ntook my leave.\r\n\r\nI thought I should have dropped dead in the room when, lost in a deep\r\nreverie, I opened my chamber-door, and discovered, sitting at the\r\ntable, the very man himself. _There the idiot sat_, portrait in hand,\r\nencountering me with a look of unutterable sorrowfulness. He must\r\nhave hid himself amongst the folds of the curtains, for this room,\r\nas well as the rest, was looked into, and its cupboards investigated.\r\nI recoiled with sudden terror, and retreated, but the wretch clasped\r\nhis hands in agony, and implored me in gestures which could not be\r\nmistaken, to remain. I recovered, gained confidence, and forbore.\r\n\r\n\"What do you desire with me?\" I asked quickly. \"Can you speak? Do you\r\nunderstand me?\" The unhappy man dropped on his knees, and took my\r\nhand--cried like a beaten child--sobbed and groaned. He raised the\r\nlikeness of his sister to my eyes, and then I saw the fire sparkling\r\nin his own lustrous orb, and the supplication bursting from it, that\r\nwas not to be resisted. He pointed to his mouth, compelled an\r\ninarticulate sound, and looked at me again, to assure me that he had\r\nspoken all his faculties permitted him. He waited for any answer.\r\n\r\nMelted with pity for the bruised soul before me, I could no longer\r\ndeny him the gratification he besought.\r\n\r\n\"Emma!\" I ejaculated; \"Emma Harrington!\"\r\n\r\nHe wept aloud, and kissed my hand, and put my arm upon his breast,\r\nand caressed it with his own weak head. I permitted the affectionate\r\ncreature to display his childish gratitude, and then, taking him by\r\nthe wrist, I withdrew him from the room. An infant could not have\r\nbeen more docile with its nurse. In another moment he was again in\r\ncustody.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that I strove to fall asleep, and to forget the\r\ncircumstances of the day--in vain that I endeavored to carry out the\r\nresolution which I had taken to my pillow. Gladly would I have\r\nexpelled all thought of the idiot from my mind, and risen on the\r\nmorrow, prepared by rest and sweet suspension of mental labour for\r\nprofitable deliberation. Sound as was the advice of my friend, and\r\nanxious as I was to follow it, obedience rested not with me, and was\r\nimpossible. Should I make known the history of the man? Should I\r\ndiscover his crime? This was the question that haunted my repose,\r\nand knocked at my ears until my labouring brain ached in its\r\nconfusion. What might be the effect of a disclosure upon the future\r\nexistence of the desolate creature, should he ever recover his reason?\r\nMust he not suffer the extreme penalty of the law? It was dreadful\r\nto think that his life should be forfeited through, and only through,\r\nmy agency. There were reasons again equally weighty, why I should\r\nnot conceal the facts which were in my possession. How I should have\r\ndetermined at length, I know not, if an argument--founded on\r\nselfishness had not stepped in and turned the balance in favour of\r\nthe idiot. Alas, how easy is it to decide when self-interest\r\ninterposes with its intelligence and aid! Neither Mr. Fairman nor\r\nDoctor Mayhew knew of my connexion with the unfortunate Emma\r\nHarrington. To expose the brother would be to commit myself. I was\r\nnot yet prepared to acknowledge to the father of Miss Fairman, or to\r\nhis friend, the relation that I had borne to that poor girl. And why\r\nnot? If to divulge the secret were an act of justice, why should I\r\nhesitate to do it on account of the incumbent, with whom I had\r\nbroken off all intercourse for ever? Ah, did I in truth believe that\r\nour separation had been final? Or did I harbour, perhaps against\r\nreason and conviction, a hope, a thought of future reconciliation, a\r\nshadowy yet not weak belief that all might yet end happily, and that\r\nfortune still might favour love! With such faint hope, and such\r\nbelief, I must have bribed myself to silence, for I left my couch\r\nresolved to keep my secret close. Doctor Mayhew was deep in the\r\ncontemplation of a map when I joined him at the breakfast-table. He\r\ndid not take his eyes from it when I entered the apartment, and he\r\ncontinued his investigations some time after I had taken my seat. He\r\nraised his head at last, and looked hard at me, apparently without\r\nperceiving me, and then he resumed his occupation without having\r\nspoken a syllable: after a further study of five or ten minutes, he\r\nshook his head, and pressed his lips, and frowned, and stroked his\r\nchin, as though he was just arriving at the borders of a notable and\r\ngreat discovery. \"It will be strange indeed!\" he muttered to himself.\r\n\"How can we find it out?\"\r\n\r\nI did not break the thread of cogitation.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" continued Doctor Maybew, \"he must leave this house, at\r\nall events. I will run the risk of losing him no longer. I will\r\nwrite this morning to the overseer. Yet I _should_ like to\r\nknow--really--it may be, after all, the case. Stukely, lad, look here.\r\nWhat county is this?\" he continued, placing his finger on the map.\r\n\r\nSomerset was written in the corner of it, and accordingly I answered.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" replied the doctor. \"Now, look here. Read this. What do\r\nthese letters spell?\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed to some small characters, which formed evidently the name\r\nof a village that stood upon the banks of a river of some magnitude.\r\nI spelt them as he desired, and pronounced, certainly to my own\r\nsurprise, the word--\"_Belton_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so. Well, what do you say to that? I think I have hit it.\r\nThat's the fellow's home. I never thought of that before, and I\r\nshouldn't now, if I hadn't had occasion for the road-book. It was\r\nthe first thing that caught my eye. Now--how can we find it out?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is difficult!\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"It is likely enough, you see. What should bring him so far westward,\r\nif he hadn't some object? He was either wandering from or to his home,\r\ndepend upon it, when the gypsies found him. If Belton be his home,\r\nhis frequent repetition of the word was natural enough. Eh, don't\r\nyou see it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Very well; then, what's to be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell,\" I answered.\r\n\r\nThe doctor rung the bell.\r\n\r\n\"Is Robin up yet?\" he asked, when Williams came in to answer it.\r\n\r\n\"He is, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Both, sir. They have just done breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Williams, you may go. Now, follow me, Stukely,\" continued\r\nthe physician, the moment that the butler had departed. \"I'll do it\r\nnow. I am a physiognomist, and I'll tell you in the twinkling of an\r\neye if we are right, You mark him well, and so will I.\" The doctor\r\nseized his map and road book, and before I could speak was out of\r\nthe room. When I overtook him, he had already reached the idiot, and\r\ndismissed Robin.\r\n\r\nMy friend commenced his operations by placing the map and book upon\r\nthe table, and closely scanning the countenance of his patient, in\r\norder to detect and fix the smallest alteration of expression in the\r\ncoming examination. He might have spared himself the trouble. The\r\nidiot had no eye for him. When I appeared he ran to me, and\r\nmanifested the most extravagant delight. He grasped my hand, and\r\ndrew me to his chair, and there detained me. He did not introduce\r\nhis treasure, but I could not fail to perceive that he intended to\r\nrepeat the scene of the previous day, as soon as we were again alone.\r\nI did not wish to afford him opportunity, and I gladly complied with\r\nthe physician's request when he called upon me to interrogate the\r\nidiot, in the terms he should employ. He had already himself applied\r\nto the youth, but neither for himself nor his questions could he\r\nobtain the slightest notice. The eye, the heart, and, such as it was,\r\nthe mind of the idiot, were upon his sister's friend.\r\n\r\n\"Ask him, Stukely,\" began the doctor, \"if he has ever been in\r\nSomerset?\"\r\n\r\nI did so, and, in truth, the word roused from their long slumber, or\r\nwe believed they did, recollections that argued well for the\r\nphysician's theory. The idiot raised his brow, and smiled.\r\n\r\nThe doctor referred to his map, and said, whispering as before,\r\n\"Mention the river Parret.\"\r\n\r\nI could not doubt that the name had been familiar to the unhappy man.\r\nHe strove to speak, and could not, but he nodded his head\r\naffirmatively and quickly, and the expression of his features\r\ncorroborated the strong testimony.\r\n\r\n\"Now--_Belton_?\" added the doctor.\r\n\r\nI repeated the word, and then the agony of supplication which I had\r\nwitnessed once before, was re-enacted, and the shrill and incoherent\r\ncries burst from his afflicted breast.\r\n\r\n\"I am satisfied!\" exclaimed the doctor, shutting his book. \"He shall\r\nleave my house for Belton this very afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so he did, In an hour, arrangements were in progress for his\r\ndeparture, and I was his guardian and companion. Robin, as soon as\r\nDr. Mayhew's intention was known, refused to have any thing more to\r\nsay, either inside the house or out of it, to the _devil incarnate_,\r\nas he was pleased to call the miserable man. If his place depended\r\nupon his taking charge of him, he was ready to resign it. There was\r\nnot another man whom the physician seemed disposed to trust, and in\r\nhis difficulty he glanced at me. I understood his meaning. He\r\nproceeded to express his surprise and pleasure at finding an\r\nattachment so strong towards me on the part of the idiot. \"It was\r\nremarkable,\" he said--\"very! And what a pity it was that he hadn't\r\ncultivated the same regard for somebody else. A short journey\r\n_then_, to Somerset, would have been the easiest thing in the world.\r\nNothing but to pop into the coach, to go to an inn on arriving in\r\nBelton, and to make enquiries, which, no doubt, would be\r\nsatisfactorily answered in less than no time. Yes, really, it was a\r\nhundred pities!\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked at me again, and then I had already determined to\r\nmeet the request he was not bold to ask. I believed, equally with the\r\nphysician, from the conduct and expressions of young Harrington, that\r\nthe riddle of his present condition waited for explanation in the\r\nvillage, whose name seemed like a load upon his heart, and\r\nconstituted the whole of his discourse since he had arrived amongst\r\nus. It was there he yearned to be. It was necessary only to mention\r\nthe word to throw him into an agitation, which it took hours entirely\r\nto dissipate. Yes, for a reason well known to him and hidden from us\r\nall, his object, his only object as it appeared, was to be removed,\r\nand to be conducted thither. I had but one reason for rejecting the\r\notherwise well sustained hypothesis of my friend. During my whole\r\nintercourse with Emma, I had never heard her speak of Somerset or\r\nBelton, and in her narrative no allusion was made either to the\r\nshire or village. In what way, then, could it be so intimately\r\nconnected with her brother--whence was the origin of the hold which\r\nthis one word had taken of his shattered brain? I could not guess.\r\nBut, on the other hand, it was true that I was ignorant of his\r\nhistory subsequently to the fearful death of his most sinful father.\r\nHow could I tell what new events had arisen, what fresh relations\r\nmight have sprung up, to attach and bind him to one particular spot\r\nof ground? Urged by curiosity to discover all that yet remained to\r\nknow of his career, and more by a natural and strong desire to serve\r\nthe youth--not to desert him in the hour of his extremity--I resolved,\r\nwith the first hint of the doctor, to become myself the fellow\r\ntraveller of his _protégé_. I told him so, and the doctor shook me by\r\nthe hand, and thanked me heartily.\r\n\r\nThat very evening we were on our road, for our preparations were not\r\nextensive. My instructions were to carry him direct to Belton, to\r\nascertain, if possible, from his movements the extent of his\r\nacquaintance with the village, and to present him at all places of\r\nresort, in the hope of having him identified. Two days were granted\r\nfor our stay. If he should be unknown, we were then to return, and\r\nDoctor Mayhew would at once resign him to the parish. These were his\r\nwords at parting. We had no opposition in the idiot. His happiness\r\nwas perfect whilst I remained with him. He followed me eagerly\r\nwhithersoever I went, and was willing to be led, so long as I\r\ncontinued guide. I took my seat in the coach, and he placed himself\r\nat my side, trembling with joyousness, and laughing convulsively.\r\nOnce seated, he grasped my hand as usual, and did not, through the\r\nlivelong night, relinquish it altogether. A hundred affectionate\r\nindications escaped him, and in the hour of darkness and of quiet,\r\nit would have been easy to suppose that an innocent child was\r\nnestling near me, _homeward bound_, and, in the fulness of its\r\nexpectant bliss, lavish of its young heartfelt endearments. Yes, it\r\nwould have been, but for other thoughts, blacker than the night\r\nitself--how much more fearful!--which rendered every sign of\r\nfondness a hollow, cold, and dismal mockery. Innocence! Alas, poor\r\nparricide!\r\n\r\nIn the morning the sun streamed into the coach, of which we were the\r\nonly inside passengers. Dancing and playing came the light, now here,\r\nnow there, skipping along the seat, and settling nowhere--cheerful\r\nvisitant, and to the idiot something more, for he gazed upon it, and\r\nfollowed its fairy motion, lost in wonder and delight. He looked\r\nfrom the coach-window, and beheld the far-spreading fields of beauty\r\nwith an eye awakened from long lethargy and inaction. He could not\r\ngaze enough. And the voice of nature made giddy the sense of hearing\r\nthat drank intoxication from the notes of birds, the gurgling of a\r\nbrook, the rustling of a thousand leaves. His feeble powers, taken by\r\nsurprise, were vanquished by the summer's loveliness. Once, when our\r\ncoach stopped, a peasant girl approached us with a nosegay, which\r\nshe entreated me to buy. My fellow-traveller was impatient to obtain\r\nit. I gave it to him, and, for an hour, all was neglected for the toy.\r\nHe touched the flowers one by one, viewed them attentively and\r\nlovingly, as we do children whom we have known, and watched, and\r\nloved from infancy--now caressing this, now smiling upon that. What\r\nrecollections did they summon in the mind of the destitute and\r\nalmost mindless creature? What pictures rose there?--pictures that\r\nmay never be excluded from the soul of man, however dim may burn the\r\nintellectual light. His had been no happy boyhood, yet, in the\r\nwilderness of his existence, there must have been vouchsafed to him\r\nin mercy the few green spots that serve to attach to earth the most\r\nafflicted and forlorn of her sad children. How natural for the\r\nglimpses to revisit the broken heart, thus employed, thus roused and\r\nanimated by the light of heaven, rendering all things beautiful and\r\nglad!\r\n\r\nAs we approached the village, my companion ceased to regard his\r\nmany-coloured friends with the same exclusive attention and unmixed\r\ndelight. His spirits sank--his joy fled. Clouds gathered across his\r\nbrow; he withdrew his hand from mine, and he sat for an hour,\r\nbrooding. He held the neglected nosegay before him, and plucked the\r\npretty leaves one by one--not conscious, I am sure, of what he did.\r\nIn a short time, every flower was destroyed, and lay in its\r\nfragments before him. Then, as if stung by remorse for the cruel act,\r\nor shaken by the heavy thoughts that pressed upon his brain, he\r\ncovered his pallid face, and groaned bitterly. What were those\r\nthoughts? How connected with the resting-place towards which we were\r\nhastening rapidly? My own anxiety became intense.\r\n\r\nThe village of Belton, situated near the mouth, and at the broadest\r\npart of the river Parret, consisted of one long narrow street, and a\r\nfew houses scattered here and there on the small eminences which\r\nsheltered it. The adjacent country was of the same character as that\r\nwhich we had quitted--less luxuriant, perhaps, but still rich and\r\nstriking. We arrived at mid-day. I determined to alight at the inn\r\nat which the coach put up, and to make my first enquiries there.\r\nFrom the moment that we rattled along the stones that formed the\r\nentrance to the village, an unfavourable alteration took place in my\r\ncompanion. He grew excited and impatient; and his lips quivered, and\r\nhis eyes sparkled, as I had never seen them before. I was satisfied\r\nthat we had reached the object of his long desire, and that in a few\r\nminutes the mysterious relation in which he stood to the place would\r\nbe ascertained. \"He MUST be known,\" I continued to repeat to myself;\r\n\"the first eye that falls on him, will recognize him instantly.\" We\r\nreached the inn; we alighted. The landlord and the ostler came to\r\nthe coach door, and received us with extreme civility, and the\r\nformer assisted the idiot in his eager endeavour to reach the\r\nground--I watched the action, expecting him to start, to speak, to\r\nclaim acquaintance--and having completed the polite intention, he\r\nstood smiling and scraping. I looked at him, then at the idiot, and\r\nsaw at once that they were strangers. A dozen idlers stood about the\r\ndoor. I waited for a recognition: none came.\r\n\r\nSeated in the parlour of the inn, I asked to see the landlady. The\r\nsight of the idiot caused as little emotion in her, as it had\r\nproduced in her husband. I ordered dinner for him. Whilst it was\r\npreparing, I engaged the landlord in conversation at the door. I did\r\nnot wish to speak before young Harrington. I dared not leave him. I\r\nenquired, first, if the face of the idiot were familiar to him. I\r\nreceived for answer, that the man had never seen him in his life\r\nbefore, nor had his wife.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know the name of Harrington?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"No--never heard on it,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Fitzjones, perhaps?\"\r\n\r\n\"Many Joneses hereabouts, sir,\" said the landlord, \"but none of that\r\nthere Christian name.\"\r\n\r\nThe excitement of the idiot did not abate. He would not touch his\r\nfood nor sit quietly, but he walked swiftly up and down the room,\r\nbreathing heavily, and trembling with increasing agitation. He urged\r\nme in his own peculiar way to leave the house and walk abroad. He\r\npointed to the road and strove to speak. The attempt was fruitless,\r\nand he paced the room again, wringing his hands and sighing\r\nsorrowfully. At length I yielded to his request, and we were again\r\nin the village, I following whithersoever he led me. He ran through\r\nthe street, like a madman as he was, bringing upon him the eyes of\r\nevery one, and outstripping me speedily. He stopped for a moment to\r\ncollect himself--looked round as though he had lost his way, and\r\nknew not whither to proceed; then bounded off again, the hunted deer\r\nnot quicker in his flight, and instantly was out of sight. Without\r\nthe smallest hope of seeing him again, I pursued the fugitive, and,\r\nas well as I could guess it, continued in his track. For half a mile\r\nI traced his steps, and then I lost them. His last footmark was at\r\nthe closed gate of a good-sized dwelling house. The roof and highest\r\nwindows only of the habitation were to be discerned from the path,\r\nand these denoted the residence of a wealthy man. He could have no\r\nbusiness here--no object. \"He must have passed,\" thought I,\r\n\"upon the other side.\" I was about to cross the road, when I\r\nperceived, at the distance of a few yards, a man labouring in a field.\r\nI accosted him, and asked if he had seen the idiot.\r\n\r\nNo--he had not. He was sure that nobody had passed by him for hours.\r\nHe must have seen the man if he had come that way.\r\n\r\n\"Whose house is that?\" I asked, not knowing _why_ I asked the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\"What? that?\" said he, pointing to the gate. \"Oh, that's Squire\r\n_Temple's_.\"\r\n\r\nThe name dropped like a knife upon my heart. I could not speak. I\r\nmust have fallen to the earth, if the man, seeing me grow pale as\r\ndeath, had not started to his feet, and intercepted me. I trembled\r\nwith a hundred apprehensions. My throat was dry with fright, and I\r\nthought I should have choked. What follows was like a hideous dream.\r\nThe gate was opened suddenly. JAMES TEMPLE issued from it, and\r\npassed me like an arrow. He was appalled and terrorstricken. Behind\r\nhim--within six feet--almost upon him, yelling fearfully, was the\r\nbrother of the girl he had betrayed and ruined--his friend and\r\nschoolfellow, the miserable Frederick Harrington. I could perceive\r\nthat he held aloft, high over his head, the portrait of his sister.\r\nIt was all I saw and could distinguish. Both shot by me. I called to\r\nthe labourer to follow; and fast as my feet could carry me, I went on.\r\nTemple fell. Harrington was down with him. I reached the spot. The\r\nhand of the idiot was on the chest of the seducer, and the picture\r\nwas thrust in agony before his shuddering eyes. There was a\r\nstruggle--the idiot was cast away--and Temple was once more dashing\r\nonward. \"On, on!--after him!\" shrieked the idiot. They reached the\r\nriver's edge. \"What now--what now?\" I exclaimed, beholding them from\r\nafar, bewildered and amazed. The water does not restrain the scared\r\nspirit of the pursued. He rushes on, leaps in, and trusts to the\r\nswift current. So also the pursuer, who, with one long, loud\r\nexclamation of triumph, still with his treasure in his grasp,\r\nsprings vehemently forward, and sinks, once and for ever. And the\r\nbetrayer beats his way onward, aimless and exhausted, but still he\r\nnears the shore. Shall he reach it? Never!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMAGINARY CONVERSATION, BETWEEN MR. WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR AND THE\r\n   EDITOR OF BLACKWOOD'S MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nTo Christopher North, Esq.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Mr. Walter Savage Landor has become a contributor to _Blackwood's\r\nMagazine_! I stared at the announcement, and it will presently be\r\nseen why. There is nothing extraordinary in the apparition of another\r\nand another of this garrulous sexagenarian's \"Imaginary Conversations.\"\r\nThey come like shadows, so depart.\r\n\r\n  \"The thing, we know, is neither new nor rare,\r\n  But wonder how the devil it got there.\"\r\n\r\nMany of your readers, ignorant or forgetful, may have asked,\r\n\"Who is Mr. Landor? We have never heard of any remarkable person of\r\nthat name, or bearing a similar one, except the two brothers Lander,\r\nthe explorers of the Niger.\" Mr. Walter Savage would answer,\r\n\"Not to know me argues yourself unknown.\" He was very angry with\r\nLord Byron for designating him as _a_ Mr. Landor. He thought it\r\nshould have been _the_. You ought to have forewarned such readers\r\nthat _the_ Mr. Landor, now _your_ Walter Savage, is the learned\r\nauthor of an epic poem called _Gebir_, composed originally in\r\nEgyptian hieroglyphics, then translated by him into Latin, and\r\nthence done into English blank verse by the same hand. It is a work\r\nof rare occurrence even in the English character, and is said to be\r\ndeeply abstruse. Some extracts from it have been buried in, or have\r\nhelped to bury, critical reviews. A copy of the Anglo-Gebir is,\r\nhowever, extant in the British Museum, and is said to have so\r\npuzzled the few philologists who have examined it, that they have\r\ndeclared none but a sphinx, and that an Egyptian one, could unriddle\r\nit. I would suggest that some Maga of the gypsies should be called\r\nin to interpret. Our vagrant fortune-tellers are reputed to be of\r\nEgyptian origin, and to hold converse among themselves in a very\r\nstrange and curious oriental tongue called _Gibberish_, which word,\r\nno doubt, is a derivative from Gebir. Of the existence of the\r\nmysterious epic, the public were made aware many years ago by the\r\nfirst publication of Mr. Leigh Hunt's _Feast of the Poets_, where it\r\nwas mentioned in a note as a thing containing one good passage about\r\na shell, while in the text the author of _Gebir_ was called a gander,\r\nand Mr. Southey rallied by Apollo for his simplicity in proposing\r\nthat the company should drink the gabbler's health. That pleasantry\r\nhas disappeared from Mr. Hunt's poem, though Mr. Landor has by no\r\nmeans left off gabbling. Mr. Hunt is a kindly-natured man as well as\r\na wit, and no doubt perceived that he had been more prophetic than\r\nhe intended--Mr. Landor having, in addition to verses uncounted\r\nunless on his own fingers, favoured the world with five thick octavo\r\nvolumes of dialogues. From the four first I have culled a few\r\nspecimens; the fifth I have not read. It is rumoured that a sixth is\r\nin the press, with a dedication in the _issimo_ style, to Lord John\r\nRussell, Mr. Landor's lantern having at last enabled him to detect\r\none honest man in the Imperial Parliament. Lord John, it seems, in\r\nthe House of Commons lately quoted something from him about a\r\nChinese mandarin's opinion of the English; and Mr. Landor is so\r\ndelighted that he intends to take the Russells under his protection\r\nfor ever, and not only them, but every thing within the range of\r\ntheir interests. Not a cast horse, attached to a Woburn sand-cart,\r\nshall henceforth crawl towards Bedford and Tavistock Squares, but\r\nthe grateful Walter shall swear he is a Bucephalus. You, Mr. North,\r\nhave placed the cart before the horse, in allowing Mr. Landor's\r\ndialogue between Porson and Southey precedence of the following\r\nbetween Mr. Landor and yourself.\r\n\r\nYou may object that it is a feigned colloquy, in which an\r\nunauthorized use is made of your name. True; but all Mr. Landor's\r\ncolloquies are likewise feigned; and none is more fictitious than\r\none that has appeared in your pages, wherein Southey's name is used\r\nin a manner not only unauthorized, but at which he would have\r\nsickened.\r\n\r\nYou and I must differ more widely in our notions of fair play than I\r\nhope and believe we do, if you refuse to one whose purpose is\r\nneither unjust nor ungenerous, as much license in your columns as\r\nyou have accorded to Mr. Landor, when it was his whim, without the\r\nsmallest provocation, to throw obloquy on the venerated author of\r\nthe _Excursion_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          I am, Sir, your faithful servant,\r\n                                                   EDWARD QUILLINAN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Good-morning, Mr. North, I hope you are well.\r\n\r\n_North_.--I thank you, sir.--Be seated.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--I have called to enquire whether you have considered my\r\nproposal, and are willing to accept my aid.\r\n\r\n_North_.--I am almost afraid to trust you, sir. You treat the\r\nMuses like nine-pins. Neither gods nor men find favour in your sight.\r\nIf Homer and Virgil crossed your path, you would throw stones at them.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--The poems attributed to Homer, were probably, in part at\r\nleast, translations. He is a better poet than Hesiod, who has, indeed,\r\nbut little merit![49] Virgil has no originality. His epic poem is a\r\nmere echo of the Iliad, softened down in tone for the polite ears of\r\nAugustus and his courtiers. Virgil is inferior to Tasso. Tasso's\r\ncharacters are more vivid and distinct than Virgil's, and greatly\r\nmore interesting. Virgil wants genius. Mezentius is the most\r\nheroical and pious of all the characters in the Aeneid. The Aeneid, I\r\naffirm, is the most misshapen of epics, an epic of episodes.[50] There\r\nare a few good passages in it. I must repeat one for the sake of\r\nproposing an improvement.\r\n\r\n  \"Quinetiam _hyberno_ moliris sidere classem,\r\n  Et mediis properas aquilonibus ire per altum ...\r\n  Crudelis! quod si non arva aliena domosque\r\n  Ignotas peteres, et Troja antiqua maneret,\r\n  Troja per _undosum_ peteretur classibus aequor?\"\r\n\r\nIf _hybernum_ were substituted for _undosum_, how incomparably more\r\nbeautiful would the sentence be for this energetic repetition? [51]\r\n\r\n_North_.--I admire your modesty, Mr. Landor, in quoting Virgil\r\nonly to improve him; but your alteration is not an improvement. Dido,\r\nhaving just complained of her lover for putting out to sea under a\r\nwintry star, would have uttered but a graceless iteration had she in\r\nthe same breath added--if Troy yet stood, must even Troy be sought\r\nthrough a wintry sea? _Undosum_ is the right epithet; it paints to\r\nthe eye the danger of the voyage, and adds force to her complaint.\r\n\r\n_Landor_. Pshaw! You Scotchmen are no scholars. Let me proceed.\r\nVirgil has no nature. And, by the way, his translator Dryden, too,\r\nis greatly overrated.\r\n\r\n_North_..--Glorious John?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Glorious fiddlestick! It is insufferable that a rhymer\r\nshould be called glorious, whose only claim to notice is a clever\r\ndrinking song.\r\n\r\n_North_.--A drinking song?\r\n\r\n_Landor_. Yes, the thing termed an Ode for St. Cecilia's Day.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Hegh, sir, indeed! Well, let us go on with the Ancients,\r\nand dispatch them first. To revert to the Greeks, from whom Virgil's\r\nimitation of the Iliad drew us aside, favour me with your opinion of\r\nPlato.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: See Mr. Landor's \"Imaginary Conversations.\"--Vol. i. p.\r\n44, and ii. p. 322, note.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: Vol. i p. 269, 270.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: Vol. i. p. 300.]\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Plato is disingenuous and malicious. I fancy I have\r\ndetected him in more than one dark passage, a dagger in his hand and\r\na bitter sneer on his countenance.[52] He stole (from the Eyptian\r\npriests and other sources) every idea his voluminous books convey.\r\n[53] Plato was a thief.\r\n\r\n_North_.--\"Taffy was a Welshman, Taffy was a thief.\"\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Do you mean to insinuate that my dialogues are stolen\r\nfrom Plato's?\r\n\r\n_North_.--Certainly not, Mr. Landor; there is not the remotest\r\nresemblance between them. Lucian and Christopher North are your\r\nmodels. What do you think of Aristotle?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--In Plato we find only arbours and grottoes, with moss\r\nand shell work all misplaced. Aristotle has built a solider edifice,\r\nbut has built it across the road. We must throw it down again.\r\n[54]\r\n\r\n_North_.--So much for philosophy. What have you to say to Xenophon\r\nas an historian?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--He is not inelegant, but he is unimpassioned and\r\naffected; [55] and he has not even preserved the coarse features of\r\nnations and of ages in his Cyropaedia.[56]\r\n\r\n_North_.--The dunce! But what of the Anabasis?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--You may set Xenophon down as a writer of graceful\r\nmediocrity.[57]\r\n\r\n_North_.--Herodotus?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--If I blame Herodotus, whom can I commend? His view of\r\nhistory was nevertheless like that of the Asiatics, and there can be\r\nlittle to instruct and please us in the actions and speeches of\r\nbarbarians.[58]\r\n\r\n_North_.--Which of the Greek tragedians do you patronise?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Aeschylus is not altogether unworthy of his reputation;\r\nhe is sometimes grand, but oftener flighty and obscure.[59]\r\n\r\n_North_.--What say you of Sophocles?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--He is not so good as his master, though the Athenians\r\nthought otherwise. He is, however, occasionally sublime.\r\n\r\n_North_.--What of Euripides? [60]\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--He came further down into common life than Sophocles,\r\nand he further down than Aeschylus: one would have expected the\r\nreverse. Euripides  has but little dramatic power. His dialogue is\r\nsometimes dull and heavy; the construction of his fable infirm and\r\ninartificial, and if in the chorus he assumes another form, and\r\nbecomes a more elevated poet, he is still at a loss to make it serve\r\nthe interests of the piece. He appears to have written principally\r\nfor the purpose of inculcating political and moral axioms. The dogmas,\r\nlike _valets de place_, serve any master, and run to any quarter.\r\nEven when new, they are nevertheless miserably flat and idle.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Aristophanes ridiculed him.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Yes, Aristophanes had, however, but little true wit. [61]\r\n\r\n_North_.--That was lucky for Euripides.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.-A more skilful archer would have pierced him through\r\nbone and marrow, and saved him from the dogs of Archelaus.\r\n\r\n_North_.--That story is probably an allegory, signifying that\r\nEuripides was after all worried out of life by the curs of criticism\r\nin his old age.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--As our Keats was in his youth, eh, Mr. North? A worse\r\nfate than that of Aeschylus, who had his skull cracked by a tortoise\r\ndropt by an eagle that mistook his bald head for a stone.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Another fable of his inventive countrymen. He died of\r\nbrain-fever, followed by paralysis, the effect of drunkenness. He\r\nwas a jolly old toper: I am sorry for him. You just now said that\r\nAristophanes wanted wit. What foolish fellows then the Athenians\r\nmust have been, in the very meridian of their literature, to be so\r\ndelighted with what they mistook for wit as to decree him a crown\r\nof olive! He has been styled the Prince of Old Comedy too. How do you\r\nlike Menander?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: Vol. ii. p. 298.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: Vol. iii p. 514.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: Vol. iv. p 80.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: Vol. i. p. 233.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: Vol. ii. p. 331.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: Vol. iii. p. 35.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: Vol. ii. p. 332.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: Vol. i. pp. 299, 298, 297.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: Vol. i. p. 298.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: Vol. ii. p. 12.]\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--We have not much of him, unless in Terence. [62] The\r\ncharacters on which Menander raised his glory were trivial and\r\ncontemptible.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: Vol. ii. p. 5. At p. 6th, Mr. Landor produces some verses\r\nof his own \"in the manner of Menander,\" fathers them on Andrew Marvel,\r\nand makes Milton praise them!]\r\n\r\n_North_.--Now that you have demolished the Greeks, let us go back\r\nto Rome, and have another touch at the Latins. From Menander to\r\nTerence is an easy jump. How do you esteem Terence?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Every one knows that he is rather an expert translator\r\nfrom the Greek than an original writer. There is more pith in Plautus.\r\n\r\n_North_.--You like Plautus, then, and endure Terence?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--I tolerate both as men of some talents; but comedy is,\r\nat the best, only a low style of literature; and the production of\r\nsuch trifling stuff is work for the minor geniuses. I have never\r\ncomposed a comedy.\r\n\r\n_North_.--I see: farewell to the sock, then. Is Horace worth his\r\nsalt?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--There must be some salt in Horace, or he would not have\r\nkept so well. [63] He was a shrewd observer and an easy versifier; but,\r\nlike all the pusillanimous, he was malignant.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: Vol. ii. p. 249.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--Seneca?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--He was, like our own Bacon, hard-hearted and\r\nhypocritical, [64] as to his literary merits, Caligula, the excellent\r\nemperor and critic, (who made sundry efforts to extirpate the writings\r\nof Homer and Virgil,) [65] spoke justly and admirably when he compared the\r\nsentences of Seneca to lime without sand.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: Vol. iv. p. 31.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: Vol. i. p. 274.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_North_.--Perhaps, after all, you prefer the moderns?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--I have not said that.\r\n\r\n_North_.--You think well of Spenser?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--As I do of opium: he sends me to bed [66].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66:\r\n   Thee, gentle Spenser fondly led,\r\n   But me he mostly sent to bed.--LANDOR. ]\r\n\r\n_North_.--You concede the greatness of Milton?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Yes, when he is great; but his Satan is often a thing\r\nto be thrown out of the way among the rods and fools' caps of the\r\nnursery [67].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: Vol. i. p. 301.]\r\n\r\nHe has sometimes written very contemptibly; his lines on Hobbes,\r\nthe carrier, for example, and his versions of Psalms. [68] Milton was\r\nnever so great a regicide as when he smote King David.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: Blackwood.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--You like, at least, his hatred of kings?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--That is somewhat after my own heart, I own; but he does\r\nnot go far enough in his hatred of them.\r\n\r\n_North_.--You do?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--I despise and abominate them. How many of them, do you\r\nthink, could name their real fathers? [69]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: Vol. i. p. 61.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--But, surely, Charles was a martyr?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--If so, what were those who sold [70] him?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: Vol. iv. p. 283.]\r\n\r\nHa, ha, ha! You a Scotchman, too! However, Charles was not a martyr.\r\nHe was justly punished. To a consistent republican, the diadem\r\nshould designate the victim: all who wear it, all who offer it, all\r\nwho bow to it, should perish. Rewards should be offered for the\r\nheads of those monsters, as for the wolves, the kites, and the vipers.\r\nA true republican can hold no milder doctrine of polity, than that\r\nall nations, all cities, all communities, should enter into one\r\ngreat hunt, like that of the ancient Scythians at the approach of\r\nwinter, and should follow up the kingly power unrelentingly to its\r\nperdition. [71] True republicans can see no reason why they should\r\nnot send an executioner to release a king from the prison-house of\r\nhis crimes, [72] with his family to attend him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: Vol. iv. 507.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: Vol. i. p. 73.]\r\n\r\nIn my Dialogues, I have put such sentiments into the mouth of\r\nDiogenes, that cynic of sterling stamp, and of Aeschines, that\r\nincorruptible orator, as suitable to the maxims of their government. [73]\r\nTo my readers, I leave the application of them to nearer interests.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: Mr. Landor, with whom the Cynic is a singular favourite,\r\nsays, p. 461, vol. iii., that Diogenes was not expelled from Sinope\r\nfor having counterfeited money; that he only marked false men.\r\nAeschines was accused of having been bribed by Philip of Macedon.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--But you would not yourself, in your individual character,\r\nand in deliberate earnestness, apply them to modern times and\r\nmonarchies?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Why not? Look at my Dialogue with De Lille. [74] What\r\nhave I said of Louis the Fourteenth, the great exemplar of kingship,\r\nand of the treatment that he ought to have received from the English?\r\nDeprived of all he had acquired by his treachery and violence,\r\nunless the nation that brought him upon his knees had permitted two\r\ntraitors, Harley and St. John, to second the views of a weak woman,\r\nand to obstruct those of policy and of England, he had been carted\r\nto condign punishment in the _Place de Grêve_ or at Tyburn. _Such\r\nexamples are much wanted, and, as they can rarely be given, should\r\nnever be omitted_.[75]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: Vol. i.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: Vol. i. p. 281.--Landor.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--The Sans-culottes and Poissardes of the last French\r\nrevolution but three, would have raised you by acclamation to the\r\ndignity of Decollator of the royal family of France for that brave\r\nsentiment. But you were not at Paris, I suppose, during the reign of\r\nthe guillotine, Mr. Landor?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--I was not, Mr. North. But as to the king whose plethory\r\nwas cured by that sharp remedy, he, Louis the Sixteenth, was only\r\ndragged to a fate which, if he had not experienced it, he would be\r\nacknowledged to have deserved. [76]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: Vol. ii. p. 267. This truculent sentiment the Dialogist\r\nimputes to a Spanish liberal. He cannot fairly complain that it is here\r\nrestored to its owner. It is exactly in accordance with the sentence\r\nquoted above in italics--a judgment pronounced by Mr. Landor in person.\r\n--Vol. i. p. 281. It also conforms to his philosophy of regicide, as\r\nexpounded in various parts of his writings. In his preface to the first\r\nvolume of his Imaginary Conversations, he claims exemption, though\r\nsomewhat sarcastically, from responsibility for the notions expressed\r\nby his interlocutors. An author, in a style which has all the freedom of\r\nthe dramatic form, without its restraints, should especially abstain\r\nfrom making his work the vehicle of crotchets, prejudices, and\r\npassions peculiar to himself, or unworthy of the characters speaking.\r\n\"This form of composition,\" Mr. Landor says, \"among other advantages,\r\nis recommended by the protection it gives from the hostility all\r\nnovelty (unless it be vicious) excites.\" Prudent consideration, but\r\nindiscreet parenthesis.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--I believe one Englishman, a martyr to liberty, has said\r\nsomething like that before.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Who, pray?\r\n\r\n_North_.--The butcher Ings.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Ah, I was not aware of it! Ings was a fine fellow.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Your republic will never do here, Mr. Landor.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--I shall believe that a king is better than a republic\r\nwhen I find that a single tooth in a head is better than a set. [77]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: Vol. ii. p. 31.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--It would be as good logic in a monarchy-man to say,\r\n\"I shall believe that a republic is better than a king when I am\r\nconvinced that six noses on a face would be better than one.\"\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--In this age of the march of intellect, when a pillar of\r\nfire is guiding us out of the wilderness of error, you Tories lag\r\nbehind, and are lost in darkness, Mr. North. Only the first person\r\nin the kingdom should be unenlightened and void, as only the first\r\npage in a book should be a blank one. It is when it is torn out that\r\nwe come at once to the letters. [78]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: Vol. iv. p. 405.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--Well, now that you have torn out the first page of the\r\nCourt Guide, we come to the Peers, I suppose.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--The peerage is the park-paling of despotism, arranged\r\nto keep in creatures tame and wild for luxury and diversion, and to\r\nkeep out the people. Kings are to peerages what poles are to\r\nrope-dancers, enabling then to play their tricks with greater\r\nconfidence and security above the heads of the people. The wisest\r\nand the most independent of the English Parliaments declared the\r\nthing useless. [79] Peers are usually persons of pride without dignity,\r\nof lofty pretensions with low propensities. They invariably bear\r\ntowards one another a constrained familiarity or frigid courtesy,\r\nwhile to their huntsmen and their prickers, their chaplains and\r\ntheir cooks, (or indeed any other man's,) they display unequivocal\r\nsigns of ingenuous cordiality.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: Vol. iv. p. 400.]\r\n\r\nHow many do you imagine of our nobility are not bastards or sons of\r\nbastards? [80]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: Vol. iv. p. 273.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--You have now settled the Peers. The Baronets come next in\r\norder.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Baronets are prouder than any thing we see on this side\r\nof the Dardanelles, excepting the proctors of universities, and the\r\nvergers of cathedrals; and their pride is kept in eternal agitation,\r\nboth from what is above them and what is below. Gentlemen of any\r\nstanding (like Walter Savage Landor, of Warwick Castle, and Lantony\r\nAbbey in Wales,) are apt to investigate their claims a little too\r\nminutely, and nobility has neither bench nor joint-stool for them in\r\nthe vestibule. During the whole course of your life, have you ever\r\nseen one among this, our King James's breed of curs, that either did\r\nnot curl himself up and lie snug and warm in the lowest company, [81]\r\nor slaver and whimper in fretful quest of the highest.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: Vol. iv. p. 400.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--But you allow the English people to be a great people.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--I allow them to be a nation of great fools. [82]\r\nIn England, if you write dwarf on the back of a giant, he will go\r\nfor a dwarf.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: Vol. iii. p. 135.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--I perceive; some wag has been chalking your back in that\r\nfashion. Why don't you label your breast with the word giant?\r\nPerhaps you would then pass for one.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--I have so labelled it, but in vain.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Yet we have seen some great men, besides yourself,\r\nMr. Landor, in our own day. Some great military commanders, for\r\nexample; and, as a particular instance, Wellington.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--It cannot be dissembled that all the victories of the\r\nEnglish, in the last fifty years, have been gained by the high\r\ncourage and steady discipline of the soldier, [83] and the most\r\nremarkable where the prudence and skill of the commander were\r\naltogether wanting.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: Vol. ii. p 214.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--Ay, that was a terrible mistake at Waterloo. Yet you\r\nwill allow Wellington to have been something of a general, if not in\r\nIndia, at least in Spain.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Suppose him, or any distinguished general of the English,\r\nto have been placed where Murillo was placed in America, Mina in\r\nSpain; then inform me what would have been your hopes? [84]\r\nThe illustrious Mina, [85] of all the generals who have appeared in our\r\nage, has displayed the greatest genius, and the greatest constancy.\r\nThat exalted personage, the admiration of Europe, accomplished the\r\nmost arduous and memorable work that any one mortal ever brought to\r\nits termination.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: Vol. ii. p. 214.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: Vol. ii. p. 3. Ded. \"to Mina.\"--Wilson.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--We have had some distinguished statesmen at the helm in\r\nour time, Mr. Landor.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Not one.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Mr. Pitt.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Your pilot that weathered the storm. Ha, ha! He was the\r\nmost insidious republican that England ever produced.\r\n\r\n_North_.--You should like him if he was a Republican.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--But he was a debaser of the people as well as of the\r\npeerage. By the most wasteful prodigality both in finance and war,\r\nhe was enabled to distribute more wealth among his friends and\r\npartisans than has been squandered by the uncontrolled profusion of\r\nFrench monarchs from the first Louis to the last. [86] Yet he was\r\nmore short-sighted than the meanest insect that can see an inch\r\nbefore it. You should have added those equally enlightened and\r\nprudent leaders of our Parliament, Lord Castlereagh and his\r\nsuccessors. Pitt, indeed! whose requisites for a successful minister\r\nwere three--to speak like an honest man, to act like a scoundrel,\r\nand to be indifferent which he is called. But you have forgotten my\r\ndialogue between him and that wretched fellow Canning. [87]\r\nI have there given Pitt his quietus. As to Castlereagh and Canning,\r\nI have crushed them to powder, spit upon them, kneaded them into\r\ndough again; and pulverized them once more. Canning is the man who\r\ndeserted his party, supplanted his patrons, and abandoned every\r\nprinciple he protested he would uphold. [88] Castlereagh is the\r\nstatesman who was found richer one day, by a million of zecchins,\r\nthan he was the day before, and this from having signed a treaty!\r\nThe only life he ever personally aimed at was the vilest in existence,\r\nand none complains that he succeeded in his attempt. [89] I forgot:\r\nhe aimed at another so like it, (you remember his duel with Canning,)\r\nthat it is a pity it did not form a part of it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: Vol. ii. p. 240, 241, 242.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: Vol. iii. p. 66.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: Vol. iii. p. 134.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: Vol. iii. p. 172, and that there should be no mistake as\r\nto the person indicated, Lord Castlereagh is again accused by name\r\nat p. 187. The same charge occurs also in the dialogue between\r\nAristotle and Calisthenes! p 334, 335, 336; where Prince Metternich,\r\n(Metanyctius,) the briber, is himself represented as a traitor to\r\nhis country. Aristotle is the teller of this cock-and-bull story!]\r\n\r\n_North_.--Horrible! most horrible!\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Hear Epicurus and Leontion and Ternissa discuss the\r\nmerits of Castlereagh and Canning.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Epicurus! What, the philosopher who flourished some\r\ncenturies before the Christian era?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--The same. He flourishes still for my purposes.\r\n\r\n_North_.--And who are Leontion and Ternissa?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Two of his female pupils.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Oh, two of his misses! And how come they and their master,\r\nwho lived above 2000 years before the birth of Canning and\r\nCastlereagh, to know any thing about them?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--I do not stand at trifles of congruity. Canning is the\r\nvery man who has taken especial care that no strong box among us\r\nshall be without a chink at the bottom; the very man who asked and\r\nreceived a gratuity (you remember the Lisbon job) [90] from the colleague\r\nhe had betrayed, belied, and thrown a stone at, for having proved\r\nhim in the great market-place a betrayer and a liar. Epicurus describes\r\nCanning as a fugitive slave, a writer of epigrams on walls, and of songs\r\non the grease of platters, who attempted to cut the throat of a fellow\r\nin the same household, [91] who was soon afterward more successful in doing\r\nit himself.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: Vol. iv. p. 194.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: Vol. iv. p. 194.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--Horrible, most horrible mockery! But even that is not new.\r\nIt is but Byron's brutal scoff repeated--\"Carotid-artery-cutting\r\nCastlereagh.\"\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--You Tories affect to be so squeamish. Epicurus goes on\r\nto show Canning's ignorance of English.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Epicurus! Why not William Cobbett?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--The Athenian philosopher introduces the trial of George\r\nthe Fourth's wife, and describes her as a drunken old woman, the\r\ncompanion of soldiers and sailors, and lower and viler men. One\r\nwhose eyes, as much as can be seen of them, are streaky fat floating\r\nin semi-liquid rheum.\r\n\r\n_North_.--And this is the language of Epicurus to his female pupils!\r\nHe was ever such a beast.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--You are delicate. He goes on to allude to Canning's\r\nhaving called her the _pride, the life, the ornament of society_,\r\n(you know he did so call her in the House of Commons, according to\r\nthe newspaper reports; it is true he was speaking of what she had\r\nbeen many years previously; before her departure from England.) [92]\r\nEpicurus says triumphantly that the words, if used at all, should\r\nhave been placed thus--_the ornament, pride, and life_; for hardly a\r\nBoeotian bullock-driver would have wedged in _life_ between _pride_\r\nand _ornament_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: Vol. iv. p. 194, 195.--Pericles and Sophocles also\r\nprattle about Queen Caroline! vol. 2, p. 106, 107.--In another place\r\nthe judgment and style of Johnson being under sentence, the Doctor's\r\njudgment is \"alike in all things,\" that is, \"unsound and incorrect;\"\r\nand as to style, \"a sentence of Johnson is like a pair of breeches,\r\nan article of dress, divided into two parts, equal in length, breadth,\r\nand substance, with a protuberance before and behind.\" The _contour_\r\nof Mr. Landor's figure can hardly be so graceful as that of the\r\nPythian Apollo, if his dress-breeches are made in this fashion, and\r\n\"his Florentine tailor never fails to fit him.\"--See vol. i. p. 296,\r\nand p. 185, note.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--What dignified and important criticism! and how\r\nappropriate from the lips of Epicurus! But why were you, Mr. Landor,\r\nso rancorous against that miserable Queen Caroline? You have half\r\nchoked Sir Robert Wilson, one of her champions, and the marshal of\r\nher coffin's royal progress through London, with a reeking panegyric\r\nin your dedication to him [93] of a volume of your Talks.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: Vol. iii.]\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--I mistook Wilson for an uncompromising Radical. As to\r\nhis and Canning's nobled Queen, I confess I owed her a grudge for\r\ndisrespect to me at Como long before.\r\n\r\n_North_.--How? Were you personally acquainted with her?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Not at all: She was not aware that there was such a man\r\nas Walter Savage Landor upon earth, or she would have taken care\r\nthat I should not be stopt by her porter at the lodge-gate, when I\r\ntook a fancy to pry into the beauties of her pleasure-ground.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Then her disrespect to you was not only by deputy, but\r\neven without her cognisance?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Just so.\r\n\r\n_North_.--And that was the offence for which you assailed her with\r\nsuch a violent invective after her death?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Oh no! it might possibly have sharpened it a little;\r\nbut I felt it my duty, as a censor of morals, to mark my reprobation\r\nof her having grown fat and wrinkled in her old age. It was\r\nnecessary for me to correct the flattering picture drawn of her by\r\nthat caitiff Canning. You know the contempt of Demosthenes for\r\nCanning.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Demosthenes, too!\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Yes, in my dialogue between him and Eubulides, he\r\ndelineates Canning as a clumsy and vulgar man.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Every one knows that he was a man of remarkably fine\r\nperson and pleasing manners.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Never mind that--A vulgar and clumsy man, a\r\nmarket-place demagogue, lifted on a honey-barrel by grocers and\r\nslave-merchants, with a dense crowd around him, who listen in\r\nrapture because his jargon is unintelligible. [94] Demosthenes, you\r\nknow, was a Liverpool electioneering agent, so he knew all about\r\nCanning and his tricks, and his abstraction of L.14,000 sterling\r\nfrom the public treasury to defray the expenses of his shameful\r\nflight to Lesbos, that is Lisbon.[95]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: Vol. i. p. 245.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: Vol. i. p. 247. This charge against Canning is\r\nrepeated at Vol. iii. p. 186, 187, and again at Vol. iv. p. 193.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--Has England produced no honest men of eminence,\r\nMr. Landor?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Very few; I can, however, name two--Archbishop Boulter\r\nand Philip Savage. [96] I am not certain that I should ever have thought\r\nof recording their merits, if their connexion with my own family had\r\nnot often reminded me of them; we do not always bear in mind very\r\nretentively what is due to others, unless there is something at home\r\nto stimulate the recollection. Boulter, Primate of Ireland, saved\r\nthat kingdom from pestilence and famine in 1729 by supplying the\r\npoor with bread, medicines, attendance, and every possible comfort\r\nand accommodation. Again, in 1740 and 1741, no fewer than 250,000\r\npersons were fed, twice a-day, principally at his expense. Boulter\r\nwas certainly the most disinterested, the most humane, the most\r\nbeneficent, and after this it is little to say, the most enlightened\r\nand learned man that ever guided the counsels of a kingdom.[97]\r\nMr. Philip Savage, Chancellor of the Exchequer, married his wife's\r\nsister, of his own name, but very distantly related. This minister\r\nwas so irreproachable, that even Swift could find no fault with him.\r\n[97] He kept a groom in livery, and two saddle-horses.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: Also Vol. iii. p. 92.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: Vol. iii. p. 91, 92, note.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--Is it possible? And these great men were of your family,\r\nMr. Landor!\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--I have told you so, sir--Philip was one of my Savage\r\nancestors, [98] and he and Boulter married sisters, who were also Savages.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: Vol. iii. p. 92, note.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--You have lived a good while in Italy? You like the\r\nItalians, I believe?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--I despise and abominate the Italians; and I have taken\r\nsome pains to show it in various ways. During my long residence at\r\nFlorence I was the only Englishman there, I believe, who never went\r\nto court, leaving it to my hatter, who was a very honest man, and my\r\nbreeches-maker, who never failed to fit me. [99] The Italians were\r\nalways--far exceeding all other nations--parsimonious and avaricious,\r\nthe Tuscans beyond all other Italians, the Florentines beyond all other\r\nTuscans. [100]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: Vol. i. p. 185.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: Vol. i. p. 219.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--But even Saul was softened by music: surely that of\r\nItaly must have sometimes soothed you?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--_Opera_ was, among the Romans, _labour_, as _operae\r\npretium_, &c. It now signifies the most contemptible of performances,\r\nthe vilest office of the feet and tongue. [101]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: Vol. i. p. 212.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--But the sculptors, the painters, the architects of Italy?\r\nYou smile disdainfully, Mr. Landor!\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--I do; their sculpture and painting have been employed\r\non most ignoble objects--on scourgers and hangmen, on beggarly\r\nenthusiasts and base impostors. Look at the two masterpieces of the\r\npencil; the Transfiguration of Raphael, and the St. Jerome of\r\nCorreggio; [102] can any thing be more incongruous, any thing more\r\ncontrary to truth and history?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: Vol. i. p. 109, note.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--There have been able Italian writers both in verse and\r\nprose?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--In verse not many, in prose hardly any.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Boccaccio?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--He is entertaining.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Machiavelli?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--A coarse comedian. [103]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: Vol. ii. p. 252.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--You honour Ariosto?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--I do not. Ariosto is a plagiary, the most so of all\r\npoets. [104] Ariosto is negligent; his plan inartificial, defective, bad.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: Vol. i. p. 290.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--You protect Tasso?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--I do, especially against his French detractors.\r\n\r\n_North_.--But you esteem the French?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--I despise and abominate the French.\r\n\r\n_North_.--And their literature!\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--And their literature. As to their poets, bad as Ariosto\r\nis, divide the Orlando into three parts, and take the worst of them,\r\nand although it may contain a large portion of extremely vile poetry,\r\nit will contain more of good than the whole French language. [105]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: Vol. i. p. 290.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--Is Boileau so very contemptible?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Beneath contempt. He is a grub. [106]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: See Mr. Landor's Polite Conversation with De Lille,\r\nVol. i. and Note at the end, p. 309, 310.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--Racine?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Diffuse, feeble, and, like Boileau, meanly thievish.\r\nThe most admired verse of Racine is stolen, [107] so is almost every other\r\nthat is of any value.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: Vol. i. p. 293, 294.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--But Voltaire, Mr. Landor?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Voltaire, sir, was a man of abilities, and author of\r\nmany passable epigrams, besides those which are contained in his\r\ntragedies and heroics, [108] though, like Parisian lackeys, they are\r\nusually the smartest when out of place. I tell you I detest and\r\nabominate every thing French. [109]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: Vol. i. p. 254.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: We, however, find Mr. Landor giving the French credit\r\nfor their proceedings in one remarkable instance, and it is so\r\nseldom that we catch him in good-humour with any thing, that we will\r\nnot miss an opportunity of exhibiting him in an amiable light. This\r\nchampion of the liberties of the world, who has cracked his lungs in\r\nendeavouring, on the shores of Italy, to echo the lament of Byron\r\nover Greece, and who denounced the powers of Europe for suffering\r\nthe Duke d'Angoulême to assist his cousin Ferdinand in retaking the\r\nTrocadero, yet approves of French proceedings in Spain on a previous\r\noccasion. Admiring reader! you shall hear Sir Oracle himself again:--\r\n\"The laws and institutions introduced by the French into Spain were\r\nexcellent, and the _king_\" (Joseph Bonaparte!) \"was liberal, affable,\r\nsensible, and humane.\" Poor Trelawney, the friend of Byron, is made\r\nto talk thus! Both Trelawney and Odysseus the noble Greek, to whom\r\nhe addresses himself, were more likely to participate in the\r\n\"indignation of a high-minded Spaniard,\" so vividly expressed by a\r\nhigh-minded Englishman in the following sonnet:--\r\n\r\n  \"We can endure that he should waste our lands,\r\n  Despoil our temples, and, by sword and flame,\r\n  Return us to the dust from which we came;\r\n  Such food a tyrant's appetite demands:\r\n  And we can brook the thought, that by his hands\r\n  Spain may be overpower'd, and he possess,\r\n  For his delight, a solemn wilderness,\r\n  Where all the brave lie dead. But, when of bands\r\n  That he will break for us he dares to speak,\r\n  Of benefits, and of a future day\r\n  When our enlighten'd minds shall bless his sway--\r\n  Then the strain'd heart of fortitude proves weak;\r\n  Our groans, our blushes, our pale cheeks declare\r\n  That he has power to inflict what we lack strength to bear.\"]\r\n\r\n_North_.--Well, Mr. Landor, we have rambled over much ground; we\r\nhave journeyed from Dan to Beersheba, and found all barren. Let us\r\nreturn home.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Before we do so, let me observe, that among several\r\nnoted Italians whom you have not glanced at, there is one whom I\r\nrevere--Alfieri. He was the greatest man of his time in Europe,\r\nthough not acknowleged or known to be so; [110] and he well knew his\r\nstation as a writer and as a man. Had he found in the world five equal\r\nto himself, he would have walked out of it not to be jostled. [111]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: Vol. ii. p. 241.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: Vol. ii. p. 258.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--He would have been sillier, then, than the flatulent\r\nfrog in the fable. Yet Alfieri's was, indeed, no ordinary mind, and\r\nhe would have been a greater poet than he was, had he been a better\r\nman. I admire his Bruto Primo as much as you do, and I am glad to\r\nhear you give your suffrage so heartily in favour of any one.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Sir, I admire the man as much as I do the poet. It is\r\nnot every one who can measure his height; I can.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Pop! there you go! you have got out of the bottle again,\r\nand are swelling and vapouring up to the clouds. Do lower yourself\r\nto my humble stature, (I am six feet four in my slippers.) Alfieri\r\nreminds me of Byron. What of him?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--A sweeper of the Haram. [112] A sweeper of the Haram is\r\nequally in false costume whether assuming the wreath of Musaeus or\r\nwearing the bonnet of a captain of Suliotes. _I_ ought to have been\r\nchosen a leader of the Greeks. I would have led them against the\r\nturbaned Turk to victory, armed not with muskets or swords but with\r\nbows and arrows, and mailed not in steel cuirasses or chain armour\r\nbut in cork caps and cork shirts. Nothing is so cool to the head as\r\ncork, and by the use of cork armour the soldier who cannot swim has\r\nall the advantage of him who can. At the head of my swimming archers\r\nI would have astonished the admirers of Leander and Byron in the\r\nDardanelles, and I would have proved myself a Duck worth two of the\r\ngallant English admiral who tried in vain to force that passage. The\r\nSultan should have beheld us in Stamboul, and we would have\r\nfluttered his dovecote within the Capi---\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: Vol. i. p. 301.--Vol. ii. p. 222, 223.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--I will not tempt you further. Let us proceed to business.\r\nTo what am I indebted for the honour of this visit, Mr. Landor?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--I sent you the manuscript of a new Imaginary\r\nConversation between Porsou and Southey.\r\n\r\n_North_.--A sort of abnegation of your former one. For what\r\npurpose did you send it to me?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--For your perusal. Have you read it?\r\n\r\n_North_.--I have, and I do not find it altogether new.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--How?\r\n\r\n_North_.--I have seen some part of it in print before.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Where?\r\n\r\n_North_.--In a production of your own.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Impossible!\r\n\r\n_North_.--In a rhymed lampoon printed in London in 1836. It is\r\ncalled \"A Satire on Satirists, and Admonition to Detractors.\" Do you\r\nknow such a thing?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--(_Aside_. Unlucky! some good-natured friend has sent\r\nhim that suppressed pamphlet.) Yes, Mr. North; a poetical manifesto\r\nof mine with that title was printed but not published.\r\n\r\n_North_.--No, only privately distributed among friends. It\r\ncontained some reflections on Wordsworth.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--It did.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Why did you suppress it?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Because I was ashamed of it. Byron and others had\r\nanticipated me. I had produced nothing either new or true to damage\r\nWordsworth.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Yet you have now, in this article that you offer me,\r\nreproduced the same stale gibes.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--But I have kept them in salt for six years: they will\r\nnow have more flavour. I have added some spice, too.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Which you found wrapt up in old leaves of the _Edinburgh\r\nReview_.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Not the whole of it; a part was given to me by\r\nacquaintances of the poet.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Eavesdroppers about Rydal Mount and Trinity Lodge. It was\r\nhardly worth your acceptance.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Then you refuse my article.\r\n\r\n_North_.--It is a rare article, Mr. Landor--a brave caricature of\r\nmany persons and things; but, before I consent to frame it in ebony,\r\nwe must come to some understanding about other parts of the\r\nsuppressed pamphlet. Here it is. I find that in this atrabilarious\r\neffusion you have treated ourselves very scurvily. At page 9 I see,\r\n\r\n  \"Sooner shall Tuscan Vallambrosa lack wood,\r\n  Than Britain, Grub street, Billingsgate, and _Blackwood_.\"\r\n\r\nThen there is a note at page 10: \"Who can account for the eulogies of\r\n_Blackwood_ on Sotheby's Homer as compared with Pope's and Cowper's?\r\nEulogy is not reported to be the side he _lies_ upon, in general.\"\r\nOn the same page, and the next, you say of Us, high Churchmen and\r\nhigh Tories,\r\n\r\n  \"Beneath the battlements of Holyrood\r\n  There never squatted a more sordid brood\r\n  Than that which now, across the clotted perch,\r\n  Crookens the claw and screams for Court and Church.\"\r\n\r\nThen again at page 12,\r\n\r\n        \"Look behind you, look!\r\n  There issues from the Treasury, dull and dry as\r\n  The leaves in winter, Gifford and Matthias.\r\n  Brighter and braver Peter Pindar started,\r\n  And ranged around him all the lighter-hearted,\r\n  When Peter Pindar sank into decline,\r\n  Up from his hole sprang Peter Porcupine\"\r\n\r\nAll which is nothing to Us, but what does it lead to?\r\n\r\n  \"Him W ... son follow'd\"--\r\n\r\nWhy those dots, Mr. Landor?\r\n\r\n  \"Him W ... son follow'd, of congenial quill,\r\n  As near the dirt and no less prone to ill.\r\n  Walcot, of English heart, had English pen,\r\n  Buffoon he might be, but for hire was none;\r\n  Nor plumed and mounted in Professor's chair\r\n  Offer'd to grin for wages at a fair.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest is too foul-mouthed for repetition. You are a man of nasty\r\nideas, Mr. Landor. You append a note, in which, without any\r\nauthority but common rumour, you exhibit the learned Professor as an\r\nimportant contributor to Blackwood, especially in those graces of\r\ndelicate wit so attractive to his subcribers. You declare, too, that\r\nwe fight under cover, and only for spite and pay; that honester and\r\nwiser satirists were brave, that--\r\n\r\n  \"Their courteous soldiership, outshining ours,\r\n  Mounted the engine and took aim from towers;\"\r\n\r\nBut that\r\n\r\n  \"From putrid ditches we more safely fight,\r\n  And push our zig-zag parallels by night.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, at page 19--\r\n\r\n  \"The Gentleman's, the Lady's we have seen,\r\n  Now blusters forth the Blackguard's Magazine;\r\n  And (Heaven from joint-stock companies protect us!)\r\n  Dustman and nightman issue their prospectus.\"\r\n\r\n_Landor (who has sate listening, with a broad grin, while Mr. North\r\nwas getting rather red in the face_.)--Really, Mr. North,\r\nconsidering that you have followed the trade of a currier for the\r\nlast thirty years, you are remarkably sensitive to any little\r\nexperiment on your own skin. Put what has my unpublished satire to\r\ndo with our present affair?\r\n\r\n_North_.--The answer to that question I will borrow from the\r\nsatire itself, as you choose to term your scurrilous lampoon. Our\r\npresent affair, then, is to consider whether Walter Savage Landor,\r\nImaginary Conversation writer, in rushlight emulation of the\r\nwax-candles that illumine our Noctes, shall be raised, as he aspires,\r\nto the dignity of Fellow of the _Blackwood_ Society. In the\r\nnote at page 13 of the said lampoon, you state that \"Lord Byron\r\ndeclared that no gentleman could write in _Blackwood_;\" and\r\nyou ask, \"Has this assertion been ever disproved by experiment?\" Now,\r\nMr. Landor, as you have thus adopted and often re-echoed Lord Byron's\r\nopinion, that _no gentleman could write in Blackwood_, and yet wish\r\nto enrol yourself among our writers, what is the inference?\r\n\r\n_Landor_. That I confess myself no gentleman, _you_ would infer.\r\n_I_ make no such confession. I would disprove Byron's assertion,\r\nby making the experiment.\r\n\r\n_North_. You do us too much honour. Yet reflect, Mr. Landor. After\r\nthe character you have given us, would you verily seek to be of our\r\nfraternity? You who have denounced us so grandiloquently--you who\r\nclaim credit for lofty and disinterested principles of action?\r\nRecollect that you have represented us as the worthy men who have\r\nturned into ridicule Lamb, Keats, Hazlitt, Coleridge--(diverse\r\nmetals curiously graduated!)--all in short, who, recently dead, are\r\nnow dividing among them the admiration of their country. Whatever\r\ncould lessen their estimation; whatever could injure their fortune;\r\nwhatever could make their poverty more bitter; whatever could tend\r\nto cast down their aspirations after fame; whatever had a tendency\r\nto drive them to the grave which now has opened to them, was\r\nincessantly brought into action against them by _us_ zealots for\r\nreligion and laws. A more deliberate, a more torturing murder, never\r\nwas committed, than the murder of Keats. The chief perpetrator of\r\nhis murder knew beforehand that he could not be hanged for it. These\r\nare your words, Mr. Landor.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--I do not deny them.\r\n\r\n_North_.--And in regard to the taste of the common public for\r\nBlackwood's Cordials, you have said that, to those who are\r\nhabituated to the gin-shop, the dram is sustenance, and they feel\r\nthemselves both uncomfortable and empty without the hot excitement.\r\n_Blackwood's_  is really a gin-palace. _Landor_.--All this I have\r\nboth said and printed, and the last sentence you have just read from\r\nmy satire is preceded by one that you have not read. An exposure of\r\nthe impudence and falsehood of _Blackwood's Magazine_ is not likely\r\nto injure its character, _or diminish the number of its subscribers_;\r\nand in this sentence you have the secret of my desire to become a\r\ncontributor to _Blackwood_. I want a popular vehicle to convey my\r\ncensures to the world, especially on Wordsworth. I do not pretend to\r\nhave any love for you and your brotherhood, Mr. North. But I dislike\r\nyou less than I do Wordsworth; and I frankly own to you, that the\r\nfame of that man is a perpetual blister to my self-love.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Your habitual contemplation of his merits has confused\r\nyou into a notion that they are your own, and you think him an\r\nusurper of the laurel crown that is yours by the divine right of\r\ngenius. What an unhappy monomania! Still, your application for\r\nredress to us is unaccountable. You should know that we Black\r\nForesters, lawless as you may suppose us, are Wordsworth's liegemen.\r\nHe is our intellectual Chief. We call him the General! We are ever\r\nbusy in promoting his fame.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--You are always blowing hot and cold on it, and have\r\ndone so for years past. One month you place him among the stars, the\r\nnext as low as the daisies.\r\n\r\n_North_.--And rightly too; for both are the better for his presence.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--But you alternately worship and insult him, as some\r\npeople do their wooden idols.\r\n\r\n_North_.--If you must learn the truth, then, he has been to us, in\r\none sense, nothing better than an unfeeling wooden idol. Some of us\r\nhave been provoked by his indifference to our powers of annoyance,\r\nand his ingratitude in not repaying eulogy in kind. We have among\r\nourselves a gander or two, (no offence, Mr. Landor,) that,\r\nforgetting they are webfooted, pretend to a perch on the tall\r\nbay-tree of Apollo, and, though heavy of wing, are angry with\r\nWordsworth for not encouraging their awkward flights. They, like you,\r\naccuse him of jealousy, forsooth!  That is the reason that they are\r\nnow gabbling at his knees, now hissing at his heels. Moreover, our\r\ncaprices are not unuseful to our interests. We alternately pique and\r\nsoothe readers by them, and so keep our customers. As day is\r\npartitioned between light and darkness, so has the public taste as\r\nto Wordsworth been divided between his reverers and the followers of\r\nthe Jeffrey heresy. After a lengthened winter, Wordsworth's glory is\r\nnow in the long summer days; all good judgments that lay torpid have\r\nbeen awakened, and the light prevails against the darkness. But as\r\nbats and owls, the haters of light, are ever most restless in the\r\nseason when nights are shortest, so are purblind egotists most\r\nuneasy when their dusky range is contracted by the near approach and\r\nsustained ascendancy of genius. We now put up a screen for the\r\nweak-sighted, now withdraw it from stronger eyes; thus we plague and\r\nplease all parties.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Except Wordsworth, whose eyelids are too tender to\r\nendure his own lustre reflected and doubled on the focus of your\r\nburnished brass. He dreads the fate of Milton, \"blasted with excess\r\nof light.\"\r\n\r\n_North_. Thank you, sir; that is an ingenious way of accounting for\r\nWordsworth's neglect of our luminous pages. Yet it rather sounds\r\nlike irony, coming from Mr. Walter Savage Landor to the editor of\r\n\"The (Not Gentleman's) Magazine.\"\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Pshaw! still harping on my Satire.\r\n\r\n_North_.--In that Satire you have charged Wordsworth with having\r\ntalked of Southey's poetry as not worth five shillings a ream. So\r\nlong as you refrained from _publishing_ this invidious imputation,\r\neven those few among Wordsworth's friends who knew that you had\r\n_printed_ it, (Southey himself among the number,) might think it\r\ndiscreet to leave the calumny unregarded. But I observe that you\r\nhave renewed it, in a somewhat aggravated form, in the Article that\r\nyou now wish me to publish. You here allege that Wordsworth\r\nrepresented Southey as an author, _all_ whose poetry was not worth\r\nfive shillings. You and I both know that Wordsworth would not deign\r\nto notice such an accusation. Through good and evil report, the\r\nbrave man persevered in his ascent to the mountain-top, without ever\r\neven turning round to look upon the rabble that was hooting him from\r\nits base; and he is not likely now to heed such a charge as this.\r\nBut his friends may now ask, on what authority it is published? Was\r\nit to you, Mr. Walter Landor, whom Southey (in his strange affection\r\nfor the name of Wat) had honoured with so much kindness--to you\r\nwhose \"matin chirpings\" he had so generously encouraged, (as he did\r\nJohn Jones's \"mellower song,\")--was it to you that Wordsworth\r\ndelivered so injurious a judgment on the works of your patron? If so,\r\nwhat was your reply? [113]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113:\r\n   \"I lagg'd; he (Southey) call'd me; urgent to prolong\r\n   My matin chirpings into mellower song.\"--LANDON. ]\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Whether it was expressed to myself or not, is of little\r\nconsequence; it has been studiously repeated, and even printed by\r\nothers as well as by me.\r\n\r\n_North_.--By whom?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--That, too, is of no importance to the fact.\r\n\r\n_North_.--I am thoroughly convinced that it is no fact, and that\r\nWordsworth never uttered any thing like such an opinion in the sense\r\nthat you report it. He and Southey have been constant neighbours and\r\nintimate friends for forty years; there has never been the slightest\r\ninterruption to their friendship. Every one that knows Wordsworth is\r\naware of his frank and fearless openness in conversation. He has\r\nbeen beset for the last half century, not only by genuine admirers,\r\nbut by the curious and idle of all ranks and of many nations,\r\nand sometimes by envious and designing listeners, who have\r\nmisrepresented and distorted his casual expressions. Instances of\r\nnegligent and infelicitous composition are numerous in Southey, as\r\nin most voluminous authors. Suppose some particular passage of this\r\nkind to have been under discussion, and Mr. Wordsworth to have\r\nexclaimed, \"I would not give five shillings a ream for such poetry\r\nas that.\" Southey himself would only smile, (he had probably heard\r\nWordsworth express himself to the same effect a hundred times); but\r\nsome insidious hearer catches at the phrase, and reports it as\r\nWordsworth's sweeping denunciation of all the poetry that his friend\r\nhas ever written, in defiance of all the evidence to the contrary to\r\nbe met with, not only in Wordsworth's every-day conversation, but in\r\nhis published works. There is no man for whose genius Mr. Wordsworth\r\nhas more steadily or consistently testified his admiration than for\r\nSouthey's; there is none for whom, and for whose character, he has\r\nevinced more affection and respect. You and I, who have both read\r\nhis works, and walked and talked with the Old Man of the Mountain,\r\nknow that perfectly well. You have perhaps been under his roof, at\r\nRydal Mount? I have; and over his dining-room fireplace I observed,\r\nas hundreds of his visitors must have done, five portraits--Chaucer's,\r\nBacon's, Spenser's, Shakspeare's, and Milton's, in one line. On the\r\nsame line is a bust on the right of these, and a portrait on the left;\r\nand there are no other ornaments on that wall of the apartment. That\r\nbust and that portrait are both of Southey, the man whom you pretend\r\nhe has so undervalued! By the bye, no one has been more ardent in\r\npraise of Wordsworth than yourself.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--You allude to the first dialogue between Southey and\r\nPorson, in Vol. i. of my _Imaginary Conversations_.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Not to that only, though in that dialogue there are\r\nsentiments much at variance with those which you would now give out\r\nas Porson's. For example, remember what Porson there says of the\r\n_Laodamia_.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--The most fervid expression in commendation of it is\r\nprinted as Porson's improperly, as the whole context shows. It\r\nshould have been Southey's.\r\n\r\n_North_.--So, I perceive, you say in this new dialogue; and such a\r\nmode of attempting to turn your back on yourself, to borrow a phrase\r\nfrom your friend Lord Castlereagh's rhetoric, will be pronounced,\r\neven by those who do not care a bawbee about the debate, as not only\r\nludicrous, but pitiably shabby. Keep your seat, Mr. Landor, and keep\r\nyour temper for once in your life. Let us examine into this\r\npretended mistake in your former dialogue about _Laodamia_. Well, as\r\nyou are up, do me the favour, sir, to mount the ladder, and take\r\ndown from yon top shelf the first volume of your _Conversations_. Up\r\nin the corner, on the left hand, next the ceiling. You see I have\r\ngiven you a high place.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Here is the book, Mr. North; it is covered with dust\r\nand cobwebs.\r\n\r\n_North_.--The fate of classics, Mr. Landor. They are above the\r\nreach of the housemaid, except when she brings the Turk's Head to\r\nbear upon them. Now, let us turn to the list of _errata_ in this\r\nfirst volume. We are directed to turn to page 52, line 4, and for\r\n_sugar-bakers_, read _sugar-bakers' wives_. I turn to the page,\r\nand find the error corrected by yourself; as are all the press\r\nerrors in these volumes, which were presented by you to a friend. I\r\nbought the whole set for an old song at a sale. You see that the\r\nomitted word _wives_ is carefully supplied by yourself, in your own\r\nhandwriting, Mr. Landor. On the same page, only five lines below\r\nthis correction, is the identical passage that you would now\r\ntransfer from Porson to Southey. Why did you not affix Porson's name\r\nto the passage then, when you were so vigilantly perfecting the very\r\npage? Why does no such correction appear even in the printed list of\r\n_errata_? Let us read the passage. \"A current of rich and bright\r\nthoughts runs throughout the poem. [114] Pindar himself would not, on that\r\nsubject, have braced one into more nerve and freshness, nor\r\nEuripides have inspired into it more tenderness and passion.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: Vol. i. p. 52.]\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Mr. North, I repeat that that sentence should have been\r\nprinted as Southey's, not Porson's.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Yet it is quite consistent with a preceding sentence\r\nwhich you can by no ingenuity of after-thought withdraw from Porson;\r\nfor the whole context forbids the possibility of its transition.\r\nWhat does Porson there testify of the _Laodamia_? That it is\r\n\"_a composition such as Sophocles might have exulted to own_!\"--and\r\na part of one of its stanzas \"_might have been heard with shouts of\r\nrapture in the Elysium the poet describes_.\" [115]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: Vol. i. p. 51. Few persons will think that Mr. Landor's\r\ndrift, which is obvious enough, could be favoured if these passages\r\ncould be _all_ shuffled over to Mr. Southey. It would be unwise and\r\ninconsistent in Mr. Landor of all men to intimate that Southey's\r\njudgment in poetry was inferior to Porson's; for Southey has been so\r\nsingular as to laud some of Mr. Landor's, and Mr. Landor has been so\r\ngrateful as to proclaim Southey the sole critic of modern times who\r\nhas shown \"a delicate perception in poetry.\" It is rash, too, in him\r\nto insinuate that Southey's opinion could be influenced by his\r\nfriendship; for he, the most amiable of men, was nevertheless a\r\nfriend of Mr. Lander also. But the only object of this argument is\r\nto show how mal-adroitly Mr. Landor plays at thimblerig. He lets us\r\nsee him shift the pea. As for the praise and censure contained in\r\nhis dialogues, we have no doubt that any one concerned willingly\r\nmakes him a present of both. It is but returning bad money to\r\nDiogenes. It is all Mr. Landor's; and, lest there should be any\r\ndoubt about the matter, he has taken care to tell us that he has not\r\ninserted in his dialogues a single sentence written by, or recorded\r\nof, the persons who are supposed to hold them.--See Vol. i. p. 96,\r\nend of note.]\r\n\r\nThese expressions are at least as fervid as those which you would\r\nreclaim from Porson, now that, like a pettifogging practitioner, you\r\nwant to retain him as counsel against the most illustrious of\r\nSouthey's friends--the individual of whom in this same dialogue you\r\ncause Southey to ask, \"What man ever existed who spent a more retired,\r\na more inoffensive, a more virtuous life, than Wordsworth, or who\r\nhas adorned it with nobler studies?\"--and what does Porson answer?\r\n\"I believe so; I have always heard it; and _those who attack\r\nhim with virulence or with levity are men of no morality and no\r\nreflection_.\" [116] Thus you print Wordsworth's praise in rubric,\r\nand fix it on the walls, and then knock your head against them. You\r\nmust have a hard skull, Mr. Landor.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: Vol. i. p. 40.]\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Be civil, Mr. North, or I will brain you.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Pooh, pooh, man! all your Welsh puddles, which you call\r\npools, wouldn't hold my brains. To return to your proffered article,\r\nthere is one very ingenious illustration in it. \"Diamonds sparkle\r\nthe most brilliantly on heads stricken by the palsy.\"\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Yes; I flatter myself that I have there struck out a\r\nnew and beautiful, though somewhat melancholy thought.\r\n\r\n_North_.--New! My good man, it isn't yours; you have purloined\r\nthose diamonds.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--From whom?\r\n\r\n_North_.--From the very poet you would disparage--Wordsworth.\r\n\r\n  \"Diamonds dart their brightest lustre\r\n  From the palsy-shaken head.\"\r\n\r\nThose lines have been in print above twenty years.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--An untoward coincidence of idea between us.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Both original, no doubt; only, as Puff says in the\r\n_Critic_, one of you thought of it the first, that's all. But how\r\nbusy would Wordsworth be, and how we should laugh at him for his\r\npains, if he were to set about reclaiming the thousands of ideas\r\nthat have been pilfered from him, and have been made the staple of\r\nvolumes of poems, sermons, and philosophical treatises without end!\r\nHe makes no stir about such larcenies. And what a coil have you made\r\nabout that eternal sea-shell, which you say he stole from you, and\r\nwhich, we know, is the true and trivial cause of your hostility\r\ntowards him!\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Surely I am an ill-used man, Mr. North. My poetry, if\r\nnot worth five shillings, nor thanks, nor acknowledgment, was yet\r\nworth borrowing and putting on. I, the author of _Gebir_, Mr. North,\r\n--do you mark me?\r\n\r\n_North_.--Yes; the author of Gebir and Gebirus; think of that, St.\r\nCrispin and Crispanus!\r\n\r\n  \"Sing me the fates of Gebir, and the Nymph\r\n  Who challenged Tamar to a wrestling match,\r\n  And on the issue pledged her precious shell.\r\n  Above her knees she drew the robe succinct;\r\n  Above her breast, and just below her arms.\r\n  'She, rushing at him, closed, and floor'd him flat.\r\n  And carried off the prize, a bleating sheep;\r\n  The sheep she carried easy as a cloak,\r\n  And left the loser blubbering from his fall,\r\n  And for his vanish'd mutton. Nymph divine!\r\n  I cannot wait describing how she came;\r\n  My glance first lighted on her nimble feet;\r\n  Her feet resembled those long shells explored\r\n  By him who, to befriend his steed's dim sight,\r\n  Would blow the pungent powder in his eye.'\" [117]\r\n\r\nIs that receipt for horse eye-powder to be found in White's Farriery,\r\nMr. Landor?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: The lines within inverted commas, are Mr. Landor's,\r\nwithout alteration.]\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Perhaps not, Mr. North. Will you cease your fooling,\r\nand allow me to proceed? \"I,\" the author of _Gebir_, \"never lamented\r\nwhen I believed it lost.\" The MS. was mislaid at my grandmother's,\r\nand lay undiscovered for four years. \"I saw it neglected; and never\r\ncomplained. Southey and Forster have since given it a place whence\r\nmen of lower stature are in vain on tiptoe to take it down. It would\r\nhave been honester and more decorous if the writer of certain verses\r\nhad mentioned from what bar he took his wine.\" [118] Now keep your ears\r\nopen, Mr. North; I will read my verses first, and then Wordsworth's.\r\nHere they are. I always carry a copy of them both in my pocket. Listen!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: Mr. Landor's printed complaint, _verbatim_, from his\r\n\"Satire on Satirists.\"]\r\n\r\n_North_.--List, oh list! I am all attention, Mr. Landor.\r\n\r\n_Landor_ (reads.)--\r\n\r\n  \"But I have sinuous shells of pearly hue\r\n  Within, and they that lustre have imbibed\r\n  In the sun's palace-porch, where, when unyoked,\r\n  His chariot-wheel stands midway in the wave.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Shake one, and it awakens--then apply\r\n  Its polish'd lip to your attentive ear,\r\n  And it remembers its august abodes,\r\n  And murmurs as the ocean murmurs there.\"\r\n\r\nThese are lines for you, sir! They are mine. What do you think of\r\nthem?\r\n\r\n_North_.--I think very well of them; they remind one of\r\nColeridge's \"Eolian Harp.\" They are very pretty lines, Mr. Landor. I\r\nhave written some worse myself.\r\n\r\n_Landor_--So has Wordsworth. Attend to the echo in the _Excursion_.\r\n\r\n                  \"I have seen\r\n  A curious child, who dwelt upon a tract\r\n  Of inland ground, applying to his ear\r\n  The convolutions of a smooth-lipp'd shell,\r\n  To which, in silence hush'd, his very soul\r\n  Listen'd intensely, and his countenance soon\r\n  Brighten'd with joy; for, murmuring from within,\r\n  Were heard sonorous cadences, whereby,\r\n  To his belief, the monitor express'd\r\n  Mysterious union with its native sea.\"\r\n\r\n_North_.--There is certainly much resemblance between the two\r\npassages; and, so far as you have recited Wordsworth's, his is not\r\nsuperior to yours; which very likely, too, suggested it; though that\r\nis by no means a sure deduction, for the thought itself is as common\r\nas the sea-shell you describe, and, in all probability, at least as\r\nold as the Deluge.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--\"_It is but justice to add, that this passage has been\r\nthe most admired of any in Mr. Wordsworth's great poem_.\" [119]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: From Mr. Landor, _verbatim_.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--Hout, tout, man! The author of the _Excursion_ could\r\nafford to spare you a thousand finer passages, and he would seem\r\nnone the poorer. As to the imputed plagiarism, Wordsworth would no\r\ndoubt have avowed it had he been conscious that it was one, and that\r\nyou could attach so much importance to the honour of having reminded\r\nhim of a secret in conchology, known to every old nurse in the\r\ncountry, as well as to every boy or girl that ever found a shell on\r\nthe shore, or was tall enough to reach one off a cottage parlour\r\nmantelpiece; but which he could apply to a sublime and reverent\r\npurpose, never dreamed of by them or you. It is in the application\r\nof the familiar image, that we recognise the master-hand of the\r\npoet. He does not stop when he has described the toy, and the\r\neffect of air within it. The lute in Hamlet's hands is not more\r\nphilosophically dealt with. There is a pearl within Wordsworth's\r\nshell, which is not to be found in your's, Mr. Landor. He goes on:--\r\n\r\n  \"Even such a shell the universe itself\r\n  Is to the ear of Faith; and there are times,\r\n  I doubt not, when to you it cloth impart\r\n  Authentic tidings of invisible things--\r\n  Of ebb and flow, and ever-during power,\r\n  And central peace subsisting at the heart\r\n  Of endless agitation.\"\r\n\r\nThese are the lines of a poet, who not only stoops to pick up a\r\nshell now and then, as he saunters along the sea-shore, but who is\r\naccustomed to climb to the promontory above, and to look upon the\r\nocean of things:--\r\n\r\n  \"From those imaginative heights that yield\r\n  Far-stretching views into eternity.\"\r\n\r\nDo not look so fierce again, Mr. Landor. You who are so censorious of\r\nself-complacency in others, and indeed of all other people's faults,\r\nreal or imagined, should endure to have your vanity rebuked.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--I have no vanity. I am too proud to be vain.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Proud of what?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Of something beyond the comprehension of a Scotchman,\r\nMr. North--proud of my genius.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Are you so very great a genius, Mr. Landor?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--I am. _Almighty Homer is twice far above Troy and her\r\ntowers, Olympus and Jupiter. First, when Priam bends before Achilles,\r\nand a second time, when the shade of Agamemnon speaks among the dead.\r\nThat awful spectre, called up by genius in after-time, shook the\r\nAthenian stage. That scene was ever before me; father and daughter\r\nwere ever in my sight; I felt their looks, their words, and again I\r\ngave them form and utterance; and, with proud humility, I say it_--\r\n\r\n     \"I am tragedian in this scene alone.\r\n       Station the Greek and Briton side by side\r\n       And if derision be deserved--deride.\"\r\n\r\n_Surely there can be no fairer method of overturning an offensive\r\nreputation, from which the scaffolding is not yet taken down, than\r\nby placing against it the best passages, and most nearly parallel,\r\nin the subject, from Æschylus and Sophocles. To this labour the\r\nwhole body of the Scotch critics and poets are invited, and, moreover,\r\nto add the ornaments of translation_. [120]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: This strange rhapsody is verily Mr. Landor's. It is\r\nextracted from his \"Satire on the Satirists.\"]\r\n\r\n_North_.--So you are not only a match for Æschylus and Sophocles,\r\nbut on a par with \"almighty Homer when he is far above Olympus and\r\nJove.\" Oh! ho! ho! As you have long since recorded that modest\r\nopinion of yourself in print, and not been lodged in Bedlam for it,\r\nI will not now take upon myself to send for a straight-waistcoat.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Is this the treatment I receive fron the Editor of\r\n_Blackwood's Magazine_, in return for my condescension in offering\r\nhim my assistance? Give me back my manuscript, sir. I was indeed a\r\nfool to come hither. I see how it is. You Scotchmen are all alike.\r\nWe consider no part of God's creation so cringing, so insatiable, so\r\nungrateful as the Scotch: nevertheless, we see them hang together by\r\nthe claws, like bats; and they bite and scratch you to the bone if\r\nyou attempt to put an Englishman in the midst of them. [121] But you\r\nshall answer for this usage, Mr. North: you shall suffer for it.\r\nThese two fingers have more power than all your malice, sir, even if\r\nyou had the two Houses of Parliament to back you. A pen! You shall\r\nlive for it. [122]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: Imaginary Conversations, vol. iv, p. 283.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: Ibid. vol. i. p. 126.]\r\n\r\n_North_.--Fair and softly, Mr. Landor; I have not rejected your\r\narticle yet. I am going to be generous. Notwithstanding all your\r\nabuse of Blackwood and his countrymen, I consent to exhibit you to\r\nthe world as a Contributor to _Blackwood's Magazine_, and, in the\r\nteeth of all your recorded admiration of Wordsworth, I will allow\r\nyou to prove yourself towards him a more formidable critic than\r\nWakley, and a candidate for immortality with Lauder. Do you rue?\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Not at all. I have past the Rubicon.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Is that a pun? It is worthy of Plato. Mr. Landor, you\r\nhave been a friend of Wordsworth. But, as _he_ says--\r\n\r\n     \"What is friendship? Do not trust her,\r\n         Nor the vows which she has made;\r\n       Diamonds dart their brightest lustre\r\n         From the palsy-shaken head.\"\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--I have never professed friendship for him.\r\n\r\n_North_.--You have professed something more, then. Let me read a\r\nshort poem to you, or at least a portion of it. It is an \"Ode to\r\nWordsworth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"O WORDSWORTH!\r\n      That other men should work for me\r\n      In the rich mines of poesy,\r\n      Pleases me better than the toil\r\n      Of smoothing, under harden'd hand,\r\n      With attic emery and oil,\r\n      The shining point for wisdom's wand,\r\n      Like those THOU temperest 'mid the rills\r\n      Descending from thy native hills.\r\n      He who would build his fame up high,\r\n      The rule and plummet must apply,\r\n      Nor say--I'll do what I have plann'd,\r\n      Before he try if loam or sand\r\n      Be still remaining in the place\r\n      Delved for each polish'd pillar's base.\r\n      _With skilful eye and fit device_\r\n      THOU _raisest every edifice_:\r\n      Whether in shelter'd vale it stand,\r\n      Or overlook the Dardan strand,\r\n      Amid those cypresses that mourn\r\n      Laodamia's love forlorn.\"\r\n\r\nFour of the brightest intellects that ever adorned any age or country.\r\nare then named, and a fifth who, though not equal to the least of\r\nthem, is not unworthy of their company; and what follows?\r\n\r\n      \"I wish them every joy above\r\n      That highly blessèd spirits prove,\r\n      Save one, and that too shall be theirs,\r\n      But after many rolling years,\r\n      WHEN 'MID THEIR LIGHT THY LIGHT APPEARS.\"\r\n\r\nHere are Chaucer, Shakspeare, Milton, Spenser, Dryden too, all in\r\nbliss above, yet not to be perfectly blest till the arrival of\r\nWordsworth among them!

[123]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: Whom Mr. L., who is the most capricious as well as the\r\nmost arrogant of censors, sometimes takes into favour.]\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--I did, Mr. North.\r\n\r\n_North_.--Sir, I accept your article. It shall be published in\r\n_Blackwood's Magazine_. Good-morning, sir.\r\n\r\n_Landor_.--Good-day, sir. Let me request your particular attention\r\nto the correction of the press. (_Landor retires_.)\r\n\r\n_North_.--He is gone! Incomparable Savage! I cannot more\r\neffectually retaliate upon him for all his invectives against us\r\nthan by admitting his gossiping trash into the Magazine. No part of\r\nthe dialogue will be mistaken for Southey's; nor even for Porson's\r\ninspirations from the brandy-bottle.\r\n\r\nAll the honour due to the author will be exclusively Mr. Walter\r\nSavage Landor's; and, as it is certainly \"not worth five shillings,\"\r\nno one will think it \"worth borrowing or putting on.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BURIAL MARCH OF DUNDEE.\r\n\r\n  Sound the fife, and raise the slogan--let the pibroch shake the air\r\n  With its wild triumphal music, worthy of the freight we bear;\r\n  Let the ancient hills of Scotland hear once more the battle song\r\n  Swell within their glens and valleys as the clansmen march along.\r\n  Never, from the field of combat, never from the deadly fray,\r\n  Was a nobler trophy carried than we bring with us to-day:\r\n  Never, since the valiant Douglas in his dauntless bosom bore\r\n  Good King Robert's heart--the priceless--to our dear Redeemer's shore!\r\n  Lo! we bring with us the hero--Lo! we bring the conquering Graeme,\r\n  Crown'd as best beseems a victor from the altar of his fame;\r\n  Fresh and bleeding from the battle whence his spirit took its flight\r\n  Midst the crashing charge of squadrons, and the thunder of the fight!\r\n  Strike, I say, the notes of triumph, as we march o'er moor and lea,\r\n  Is there any here will venture to bewail our dead Dundee?\r\n  Let the widows of the traitors weep until their eyes are dim;\r\n  Wail ye may indeed for Scotland--let none dare to mourn for him!\r\n  See, above his glorious body lies the royal banner's fold--\r\n  See, his valiant blood is mingled with its crimson and its gold--\r\n  See how calm he looks and stately, like a warrior on his shield,\r\n  Waiting till the flush of morning breaks upon the battle field.\r\n  See--O never more, my comrades! shall we see that falcon eye\r\n  Kindle with its inward lightning, as the hour of fight drew nigh;\r\n  Never shall we hear the voice that, clearer than the trumpet's call,\r\n  Bade us strike for King and Country, bade us win the field or fall!\r\n  On the heights of Killiecrankie yester-morn our army lay:\r\n  Slowly rose the mist in columns from the river's broken way,\r\n  Hoarsely roar'd the swollen torrent, and the pass was wrapp'd in gloom\r\n  When the clansmen rose together from their lair among the broom.\r\n  Then we belted on our tartans, and our bonnets down we drew,\r\n  And we felt our broadswords' edges, and we proved them to be true,\r\n  And we pray'd the prayer of soldiers, and we cried the gathering cry,\r\n  And we clasp'd the hands of kinsmen, and we swore to do or die!\r\n  Then our leader rode before us on his war-horse black as night--\r\n  Well the Cameronian rebels knew that charger in the fight!--\r\n  And a cry of exultation from the bearded warriors rose,\r\n  For we loved the house of Claver'se, and we thought of good Montrose.\r\n  But he raised his hand for silence--\"Soldiers, I have sworn a vow;\r\n  Ere the evening star shall glisten on Schehallion's lofty brow,\r\n  Either we shall rest in triumph, or another of the Graemes\r\n  Shall have died in battle harness for his country and King James!\r\n  Think upon the Royal Martyr--think of what his race endure--\r\n  Think on him whom butchers murder'd on the field of Magus Muir;--\r\n  By his sacred blood I charge ye--by the ruin'd hearth and shrine--\r\n  By the blighted hopes of Scotland--by your injuries and mine--\r\n  Strike this day as if the anvil lay beneath your blows the while,\r\n  Be they Covenanting traitors, or the brood of false Argyle!\r\n  Strike! and drive the trembling rebels backwards o'er the stormy Forth;\r\n  Let them tell their pale Convention how they fared within the North.\r\n  Let them tell that Highland honour is not to be bought nor sold,\r\n  That we scorn their Prince's anger, as we loathe his foreign gold.\r\n  Strike! and when the fight is over, if ye look in vain for me,\r\n  Where the dead are lying thickest, search for him who was Dundee!\"\r\n\r\n  Loudly then the hills re-echo'd with our answer to his call,\r\n  But a deeper echo sounded in the bosoms of us all.\r\n  For the lands of wide Breadalbane, not a man who heard him speak\r\n  Would that day have left the battle. Burning eye and flushing cheek\r\n  Told the clansmen's fierce emotion, and they harder drew their breath,\r\n  For their souls were strong within them, stronger than the grasp of\r\n       death.\r\n  Soon we heard a challenge-trumpet sounding in the pass below,\r\n  And the distant tramp of horses, and the voices of the foe;\r\n  Down we crouch'd amid the bracken, till the Lowland ranks drew near,\r\n  Panting like the hounds in summer when they scent the stately deer.\r\n  From the dark defile emerging, next we saw the squadrons come,\r\n  Leslie's foot and Leven's troopers marching to the tuck of drum;\r\n  Through the scatter'd wood of birches, o'er the broken ground and heath,\r\n  Wound the long battalion slowly till they gain'd the field beneath,\r\n  Then we bounded from our covert.--Judge how look'd the Saxons then,\r\n  When they saw the rugged mountain start to life with armed men!\r\n  Like a tempest down the ridges swept the hurricane of steel,\r\n  Rose the slogan of Macdonald--flash'd the broadsword of Lochiel!\r\n  Vainly sped the withering volley 'mongst the foremost of our band,\r\n  On we pour'd until we met them, foot to foot, and hand to hand.\r\n  Horse and man went down like drift-wood, when the floods are black at\r\n        Yule,\r\n  And their carcasses are whirling in the Garry's deepest pool.\r\n  Horse and man went down before us--living foe there tarried none\r\n  On the field of Killiecrankie, when that stubborn fight was done!\r\n\r\n  And the evening star was shining on Schehallion's distant head,\r\n  When we wiped our bloody broadswords and return'd to count the dead.\r\n  There we found him, gash'd and gory, stretch'd upon the cumber'd plain,\r\n  As he told us where to seek him, in the thickest of the slain.\r\n  And a smile was on his visage, for within his dying ear\r\n  Peal'd the joyful note of triumph and the clansmen's clamorous cheer;\r\n  So, amidst the battle's thunder, shot, and steel, and scorching flame,\r\n  In the glory of his manhood pass'd the spirit of the Graeme!\r\n\r\n  Open wide the vaults of Athol, where the bones of heroes rest--\r\n  Open wide the hallow'd portals to receive another guest!\r\n  Last of Scots, and last of freemen--last of all that dauntless race,\r\n  Who would rather die unsullied than outlive the land's disgrace!\r\n  O thou lion-hearted warrior! reck not of the after-time,\r\n  Honour may be deem'd dishonour, loyalty be called a crime.\r\n  Sleep in peace with kindred ashes of the noble and the true,\r\n  Hands that never fail'd their country, hearts that never baseness knew.\r\n  Sleep, and till the latest trumpet wakes the dead from earth and sea,\r\n  Scotland shall not boast a braver chieftain than our own Dundee!\r\n\r\n  W.E.A.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD ELLENBOROUGH AND THE WHIGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe period of a single year but just elapsed has exhibited in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Indus events of the most memorable and\r\nmomentous kind. Disasters the most disgraceful have been\r\nendured--victories the most brilliant have been achieved. The policy\r\nand the fortunes of a mighty empire under one governor, have been\r\nwholly reversed under another. Safety and security have been\r\nsubstituted for danger and dismay--a strong and dignified peace for\r\na weak and aggressive war. These changes have been coincident with a\r\ngreat revolution in domestic politics. Under Whig auspices those\r\nevils had arisen which their successors have now redressed. Under\r\nthe administration of Whigs, that flood of calamity was opened up\r\nwhich has been arrested without their aid; but which could not have\r\ncontinued its threatened course without the most perilous\r\nconsequences to the country, and the heaviest burden of responsibility\r\non the authors of the mischief.\r\n\r\nIn such circumstances it might have been expected--if manly courage\r\nor common decency were to be looked for in such a quarter--that on\r\nthese Eastern questions the Whig party should this session have\r\nfollowed one or other of two courses: either that they should have\r\ntaken a bold line of opposition, and vindicated their own Indian\r\npolicy, while they attacked that of their successors: or that they\r\nshould have preserved a prudent silence on subjects where they could\r\nsay nothing in their own praise, and have only lifted up their voice\r\nto join the general acclamations of the country for successes in\r\nwhich, though not achieved by themselves, they had the best reason\r\nto rejoice, as shielding them from the ignominy and punishment which,\r\nin an opposite event, would have been poured out by public\r\nindignation on the heads of the original wrongdoers.\r\n\r\nA strong or an honest party would have chosen one or other of these\r\nlines. But the Whigs are neither strong nor honest; and they have\r\naccordingly, in the late Indian discussions in Parlament, pursued a\r\ncourse of policy in which it is difficult to say whether feebleness\r\nor fraud be the more conspicuous. They have not ventured to\r\nvindicate their own conduct in invading the Affghan country: they\r\nhave not dared to dispute the wisdom of their successors in retiring\r\nfrom it, when the object of a just retribution was accomplished. But\r\nwhile driven from these points--while forced to acknowledge the\r\nability and judgment with which the present Governor-General has\r\napplied the forces of the empire to retrieve our honour and\r\nreputation in the East--while unable to point to a single practical\r\nmeasure as either improperly taken, or improperly omitted by him,\r\nthe Whigs could not refrain, on some pretext or other, from marring\r\nthe general joy by the discordant hissings of an impotent envy.\r\nExperiencing in an unparalleled degree both the indulgence of a\r\ngenerous nation, who are willing to forget the past in the enjoyment\r\nof the present, and the forbearance of high-minded opponents, who\r\ncould easily have triumphed in the exposure of their disastrous\r\nblunders, the Whigs have made a characteristic return, by\r\nrancorously assailing the man whom the public views as its benefactor,\r\nwith captious criticisms on the terms of a proclamation, or\r\nhypocritical objections to the transmission of a trophy. With that\r\ncunning which the faction have often shown in the use of apparent\r\nopportunities, they gained the reluctant concurrence of a few upright\r\nmen, of whose peculiar scruples they contrived to avail themselves,\r\nbut with an ignorance of the true English character, for which they\r\nare equally distinguished, they overshot the mark, and stand\r\nconvicted of a design to make a verbal misconstruction the pretence\r\nfor persecuting an absent man, and to convert honest prejudices into\r\nan unconscious instrument of oppression. They have thus earned a\r\nlarge allowance of general contempt, and they have nowhere, perhaps,\r\nexcited a stronger feeling of disgust than in the minds of those who\r\nthought themselves compelled, by a rigid conscience, to give a\r\nseeming concurrence to their proceedings.\r\n\r\nIn judging of the conduct and position of Lord Ellenborough, it were\r\ngross ingratitude and injustice to forget the nature of the\r\ncalamities with which India was assailed and threatened at the\r\ncommencement of his goverment. In the second week of March 1842, the\r\noverland mail from the East conveyed intelligence to our shores which\r\nstruck the nation to the very heart, and spread one universal\r\nfeeling of grief and dismay, approaching for a time as near to a\r\nfeeling of despondency as English breasts can be taught to know. Let\r\nus describe the effect in the words of an impartial observer writing\r\nat the time:--\r\n\r\n\"No such disastrous news has for many years reached this country as\r\nthat which has arrived from India. 'The progress of our arms' was\r\ncarried merrily on, till our flag was set beside that of our puppet,\r\nShah Soojah, in Cabul; but there the progress has abruptly\r\nterminated in the total engulfing of 'our arms.' Yes, Sir William\r\nMacnaghten had just written home to declare our supremacy established,\r\nwhen all Cabul rose beneath his feet. Sir Alex. Burnes was the first\r\nswallowed in the earthquake of arms; next Sir William himself,\r\ngovernor of Bombay, and representative of the power of England in\r\nNorth-Western India, was destroyed, and his mutilated remains were\r\nmade the object of ignominious ribaldry; and at length, if very\r\ngeneral rumour is to be believed, the English army of occupation has\r\nbeen literally expunged. Corunna, Walcheren, all the reverses that\r\nhave chequered our military career, baffle the memory to find a\r\nparallel to the utter defeat which, in the eyes of the barbarians of\r\nthe Indian frontier, has crushed our power.\"--_Spectator_, p. 242.\r\n\r\nThese were the feelings that possessed this country, and which wrung,\r\neven from the Whigs, with every wish to palliate them, an\r\nacknowledgment of the heavy disasters which had befallen us. Pressed\r\nwith the weight of these convictions, Mr. Macaulay, in a debate on\r\nthe Income-tax, in April 1842, after _cannily_ disclaiming any\r\nresponsibility for the Affghan invasion, as having been effected\r\nbefore he joined the Government, was driven to deplore these\r\nmilitary reverses as the greatest disaster that had ever befallen us:\r\nand added, somewhat incongruously:--\r\n\r\n\"He did not anticipate, if we acted with vigour, the least danger to\r\nour empire; though it must always be remembered that a great\r\nMahometan success could not but fall like a spark upon tinder, and\r\nact on the freemasonry of Islamism from Morocco to Coromandel.\"\r\n\r\nWhat, then, must have been the feeling in India, in the very focus of\r\nthis calamitous visitation? Lord Auckland's despatches, now made\r\npublic, will tell us what _he_ felt. That he contemplated from the\r\nfirst the total and instant evacuation of Affghanistan, without\r\nattempting a blow for the vindication of our honour, or the release\r\nof the prisoners, is past all dispute, from documents under his own\r\nhand. Whether he is to be blamed for this resolution, or for the\r\nstate of matters which rendered it necessary, is not here the\r\nquestion. But the fact is remarkable, as throwing further light on\r\nthe effrontery of the Whigs. Lord Palmerston, in last August,\r\ntwitted the Ministry with Lord Ellenborough's supposed intention to\r\nretire from beyond the Indus, and congratulated the country on the\r\nfrustration of that intention, as having saved us \"from the eternal\r\ndisgrace.\" He was answered by the Prime Minister at the time in\r\nterms that might have been a warning, and that are now no longer a\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\n\"The noble lord presumed much on my forbearance, in what he said with\r\nrespect to the Affghan war: and I will not be betrayed by any\r\nlanguage of his to forget what I owe to the public service in\r\nreplying to him. It is easy to say, why don't you move troops to\r\nCandahar; and why don't you move troops somewhere else? The noble\r\nlord finds no difficulty in this; but does he recollect that 26,000\r\ncamels, carrying the baggage of the troops in Affghanistan, were\r\nsacrificed before they reached it? The noble lord says, 'Who\r\ncontemplated the abandonment of Affghanistan?' _I could tell the\r\nnoble lord_. Beware, I say; let the noble lord beware of\r\nindiscriminate reflections upon those in office.\"\r\n\r\nIt is now known \"_who_ contemplated the abandonment of Affghanistan,\"\r\nwithout a struggle to punish the perfidy of the Affghans, to avenge\r\nthe insults to our honour, or to redress the wrongs of our countrymen.\r\nLord Auckland resolved on this course, without even an aspiration\r\nafter any thing better than a safe retreat. Nor is such a resolution\r\nto be wondered at when the state of our military preparations is\r\nconsidered. A letter from Sir Jasper Nicolls, of 24th January 1842,\r\nto the statements in which we see no contradiction in the _Blue Book_,\r\nexhibits at once the condition of our resources, and the feelings of\r\nthe head of the Indian army.\r\n\r\n\"After I had dispatched my letter to your Lordship in Council, I\r\nreceived the note, of which I transmit a copy herewith, from the\r\nAdjutant-General, and I had a second discussion with Mr. Clerk on the\r\nsubject of holding our ground at Jellalabad against any Affghan\r\npower or force, in view to retrieving our position at Cabul, by\r\nadvancing upon it, at the fit season, simultaneously from Candahar\r\nto Jellalabad. Having thus regained our position, and the influence\r\nwhich such proof of power must give, not only in Affghanistan but\r\namongst all the neighbouring states, we should withdraw with dignity\r\nand undiminished honour. Admitting the undeniable force of this\r\nargument, I am greatly inclined to doubt that we have at present\r\neither army or funds sufficient to renew this contest. Money may,\r\nperhaps, be attainable, but soldiers are not, without leaving India\r\nbare. Shortly before I left Calcutta, there were at least 33,000 men\r\nin our pay in Affghanistan and Scinde, including Shah Soojah's troops,\r\nbut not the rabble attached to his person. How insufficient that\r\nnumber has been to awe the barbarous and at first disunited tribes\r\nof Affghanistan and Scinde, our numerous conflicts, our late reverses,\r\nand our heavy losses fully prove. I admit that a blind confidence in\r\npersons around the late envoy--a total want of forethought and\r\nforesight on his part--unaccountable indecision at first,\r\nfollowed by cessions which, day by day, rendered our force more\r\nhelpless--inactivity, perhaps, on some occasions--have led to these\r\nreverses; but we must not overlook the effects of climate, the\r\ndifficulty of communication, the distance from our frontier, and the\r\nfanatical zeal of our opponents. No doubt your lordship can cause an\r\narmy to force its way to Cabul, if you think our name and\r\npredominance in India cannot otherwise be supported; but our means\r\nare utterly insufficient to insure our dominion over that country.\r\nIf this be granted, the questions for your lordship's decision\r\nare--whether we shall retake Cabul, to assert our paramount power;\r\nand whether, if we subsequently retire, our subjects and neighbours\r\nwill not attribute our withdrawal even then, to conscious inability\r\nto hold the country.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit the Commander-in-chief, in the beginning of\r\nFebruary transmitted to General Pollock, with the acquiescence of\r\nlord Auckland, to whom he communicated his letter, the following\r\nexplanation of the views of Government:--\r\n\r\n\"You may deem it perfectly certain that Government will not do more\r\nthan detach this brigade, and this in view to support Major-General\r\nSale, either at Jellalabad for a few weeks, or to aid his retreat;\r\nvery probably also to strengthen the Sikhs at Peshawar for some time.\r\nIt is not intended to collect a force for the reconquest of Cabul.\r\nYou will convey the preceding paragraph, if you safely can, to the\r\nMajor-General.\"\r\n\r\nSuch being the desponding views of the authorities stationed on the\r\nspot, what must have been the anxiety of the new Governor-General on\r\nhis arrival in India, when this scene of disaster suddenly opened\r\nupon him with a succession of still further calamities in its train?\r\nWe cannot better describe his position than in the words of Sir\r\nRobert Peel, in his speech on the Whig motion for censure--\r\n\r\n\"The moment he set foot in Madras, what intelligence met him!--the\r\nday he arrived at Benares, what a succession of events took place,\r\ncalculated to disturb the firmest mind, and to infuse apprehensions\r\ninto the breast of the boldest man! It has been said the cry in\r\nEngland was, 'What next?' That was a question which Lord\r\nEllenborough had to put to himself for four or five days after his\r\narrival. He lands at Madras on the 15th of February, presuming at\r\nthe time that his predecessor had secured the admirable position so\r\nfrequently spoken of in Affghanistan. He lands at Madras, after a\r\nfour months' voyage, in necessary ignorance of all that had occurred\r\nin that interval of time, and to his astonishment he hears of the\r\ninsurrection at Cabul. He receives tidings that Sir William\r\nMacnaghten and Sir Alexander Burnes, the envoy and representative of\r\nthe British Government, had been murdered; that the city was in a\r\nstate of insurrection, and that doubts were entertained as to the\r\nsecurity of the British army. What next? He arrives at Calcutta, and\r\nthere hears of the orders of his predecessor to hasten the\r\nevacuation of Affghanistan, for the noble reason of inflicting as\r\nlittle discredit as possible upon the British powers. He repairs to\r\nBenares, and there he hears the tremendous news that not only you\r\nhad lost power in Affghanistan, but that you had so depressed the\r\nspirits and shaken the confidence of the native army, that General\r\nPollock gives this melancholy account in a letter to Captain M'Gregor:\r\n--'It must no doubt appear to you and Sale most extraordinary, that,\r\nwith the force I have here, I do not at once move on; God knows it\r\nhas been my anxious wish to do so, but I have been helpless. I came\r\non ahead to Peshawar to arrange for an advance, but was saluted with\r\na report of 1900 sick, and a bad feeling among the Sepoys. I visited\r\nthe hospitals, and endeavoured to encourage by talking to them, but\r\nthey had no heart. On the 1st instant the feeling on the part of the\r\nSepoys broke out, and I had the mortification of knowing that the\r\nHindoos of four out of five native corps refused to advance. I\r\nimmediately took measures to sift the evil, and gradually reaction\r\nhas taken place, in the belief that I will wait for the\r\nreinforcements. This has caused me the utmost anxiety on your account;\r\nyour situation is never out of my thoughts; but having told you what\r\nI have, you and Sale will at once see that necessity has kept me here.\r\nI verily believe, if I were to attempt to move on now without the\r\nreinforcement, that the four regiments implicated would, as far as\r\nthe Hindoos are concerned, stand fast. The case, therefore, now\r\nstands thus--whether I am to attempt, with my present materials, to\r\nadvance, and risk the appearance of disaffection or cowardice, which\r\nin such a case could not again be got over, or wait the arrival of a\r\nreinforcement, which will make all sure--this is the real state of\r\nthe case. If I attempted now, I might risk you altogether; but if\r\nyou can hold out, the reinforcements would make your relief as\r\ncertain as any earthly thing can be.' What next? On the 17th of April,\r\nLord Ellenborough hears of the failure of General England to force\r\nthe Kojuck Pass. On the 19th of April he hears that Ghuznee has\r\nfallen. And what next? This was a question which, I repeat, Lord\r\nEllenborough had from day to day to put to himself. But what next?\r\nLord Ellenborough had to contemplate the retirement of the British\r\nforce from Afghanistan. This was due to the safety of the British\r\narmy, after the proof that the king you had set upon the throne had\r\nno root in the affections of the people, and that the army in\r\npossession of Affghanistan was separated from supplies by a distance\r\nof 600 miles. Finding this state of things, Lord Ellenborough\r\nthought he had no alternative but to bring the troops within the\r\nborders of British protection. For that difficult operation your\r\npolicy, and not that of Lord Ellenborough, is responsible. Those who\r\ninvolved the country in an expedition of this kind, ought justly to\r\nbe responsible for its retirement.\"\r\n\r\nIt is needless to detail the difficulties in which the armies of\r\nGeneral Pollock and General Nott were then placed. Despondency and\r\ndesertion prevailed among the native troops, so as to render any\r\nadvance in the utmost degree hazardous, even if they had been\r\ncapable of moving. But of the means even of retrograde motion they\r\nwere utterly destitute. The explanations given in Parliament on the\r\nvote of thanks to the army and the Governor-General, establish\r\nbeyond a doubt the absence of all means of carriage till the\r\nindefatigable exertions of Lord Ellenborough supplied them with\r\nevery thing that was needed. The Whigs affect to disparage these\r\narrangements as belonging to the vulgar department of a\r\nCommissary-General; and we may therefore infer that Lord\r\nEllenborough's predecessor would have deemed such a task beneath his\r\ndignity, and left it to some delegate, who might have performed or\r\nneglected his duty, as accident might direct. Had that been the case,\r\nthe chances are at least equal, that Lord Auckland would have been\r\nas well and as successfully served in this branch of military\r\nadministration as he had already been in the occupation of Cabul,\r\nand that further failures and reverses would have hung the tenure of\r\nour Indian empire on the cast of a die.\r\n\r\nThe evacuation of Affghanistan at the earliest possible period, was\r\ndictated both by the proceedings of Lord Auckland, by the condition\r\nof India, and by the peaceful policy of a Conservative Government.\r\nBut the mode in which it should be accomplished, and the\r\ndemonstrations of British power which should attend it, were\r\nnecessarily questions depending entirely \"upon military\r\nconsiderations;\" and for several months it seemed impossible that\r\nour armies could be put in a state of moral and physical strength,\r\nsuch as could justify the risk of any forward or devious movement of\r\nimportance. The indefatigable zeal and admirable arrangements,\r\nhowever, of the Governor-General, his personal presence near the\r\nscene of exertion, the concentration of a large and imposing force\r\non the Sutlej, giving courage and security to the troops in the field,\r\nand the undaunted spirit of British officers, succeeded at last in\r\ngiving, an altered and more encouraging complexion to the aspect of\r\nour affairs. In one of the first statements of his views, Lord\r\nEllenborough had significantly said, (15th March 1842:)--\r\n\r\n\"We are fully sensible of the advantages which would be derived from\r\nthe re-occupation of Cabul, the scene of our great disaster and of\r\nso much crime, even for week--of the means which it might afford of\r\nrecovering the prisoners, of the gratification which it would give\r\nto the army, and of the effect which it would have upon our enemies.\r\nOur withdrawal might then be made to rest upon an official\r\ndeclaration of the grounds upon which we retired, as solemn as that\r\nwhich accompanied our advance; and we should retire as a conquering,\r\nand not as a defeated, power.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was only in July that the Governor-General was in a condition\r\nto suggest the practical accomplishment of this desirable object,\r\nincidentally to our retirement from a country which we should never\r\nhave entered. On the 4th July is dated the admirable despatch to\r\nGeneral Nott, which, in the opinion of the Duke of Wellington, was\r\nall that could have been wished for, and which we cannot help\r\ntransferring to our columns:--\r\n\r\n\"You will have learnt from Mr. Maddock's letters of the 13th May and\r\n1st of June, that it was not expected that your movement towards\r\nthe Indus could be made till October, regard being had to the health\r\nand efficiency of your army. You appear to have been able to give a\r\nsufficient equipment to the force you recently despatched to\r\nKelat-i-Ghilzie, under Colonel Wymer; and since his return, you will\r\nhave received, as I infer from a private letter addressed by Major\r\nOutram to Captain Durand, my private secretary, a further supply of\r\n3000 camels.\r\n\r\n\"I have now, therefore, reason to suppose, _for the first time_,\r\nthat you have the means of moving a very large proportion of your\r\narmy, with ample equipment for any service.\r\n\r\n\"There has been no deficiency of provisions at Candahar at any time;\r\nand, immediately after the harvest, you will have an abundant supply.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing has occurred to induce me to change my first opinion, that\r\nthe measure, commanded by considerations of political and military\r\nprudence, is to bring back the armies now in Affghanistan at the\r\nearliest period at which their retirement can be effected,\r\nconsistently with the health and efficiency of the troops, into\r\npositions wherein they may have easy and certain communication with\r\nIndia; and to this extent, the instructions you have received remain\r\nunaltered. _But the improved position of your army, with sufficient\r\nmeans of carriage for as large a force as it is necessary to move in\r\nAffghanistan, induced me now to leave to your option the line by\r\nwhich you shall withdraw your troops from that country_.\r\n\r\n\"I must desire, however, that, in forming your decision upon this\r\nmost important question, you will attend to the following\r\nconsiderations:--\r\n\r\n\"In the direction of Quetta and Sukkur, there is no enemy to oppose\r\nyou; at each place occupied by detachments, you will find provisions:\r\nand probably, as you descend the passes, you will have increased\r\nmeans of carriage. The operation is one admitting of no doubt as to\r\nits success.\r\n\r\n\"If you determine upon moving upon Ghuznee, Cabul, and Jellalabad,\r\nyou will require, for the transport of provisions, a much larger\r\namount of carriage, and you will be practically without\r\ncommunications from the time of your leaving Candahar. Dependent\r\nentirely upon the courage of your army, and upon your own ability in\r\ndirection it, I should not have any doubt as to the success of the\r\noperations; but whether you will be able to obtain provisions for\r\nyour troops during the whole march, and forage for your animals, may\r\nbe a matter of reasonable doubt. Yet upon this your success will turn.\r\n\r\n\"You must remember that it was not the superior courage of the\r\nAffghans, but want, and the inclemency of the season, which led to\r\nthe destruction of the army at Cabul; and you must feel, as I do,\r\nthat the loss of another army, from whatever cause it might arise,\r\nmight be fatal to our government in India.\r\n\r\n\"I do not undervalue the account which our government in India would\r\nreceive from the successful execution by your army of a march\r\nthrough Ghuznee and Cabul, over the scenes of our late disasters. I\r\nknow all the effect with it would have upon the minds of our soldiers,\r\nof our allies, of our enemies in Asia, and of our countrymen, and of\r\nall foreign nations in Europe. It is an object of just ambition,\r\nwhich no one more than myself would rejoice to see effected; but I\r\nsee that failure in the attempt is certain and irretrievable ruin;\r\nand I would endeavour to inspire you with the necessary caution,\r\nand make you feel that, great as are the objects to be obtained by\r\nsuccess, the risk is great also.\r\n\r\n\"If you determine upon moving by Ghuznee, and entirely give up your\r\ncommunication by Quetta, I should suggest that you should take with\r\nyou only the most efficient troops and men you have, securing the\r\nretreat of the remainder upon Killa, Abdoola, and Quetta.\r\n\r\n\"You will in such case, consider it to be entirely a question to be\r\ndecided by yourself, according to circumstances, whether you shall\r\ndestroy or not the fortifications of Candahar; but, before you set\r\nout upon your adventurous march, do not fail to make the retirement\r\nof the force you leave behind you perfectly secure, and give such\r\ninstructions as you deem necessary for the ultimate retirement of the\r\ntroops in Scinde, upon Sukkur.\r\n\r\n\"You will recollect that what you will have to make is a successful\r\nmarch; that that march must not be delayed by any hazardous\r\noperations against Ghuznee or Cabul; that you should carefully\r\ncalculate the time required to enable you to reach Jellalabad in the\r\nfirst week in October, so as to form the rearguard of Major-General\r\nPollock's army. If you should be enabled by _coup-de-main_ to get\r\npossession of Ghuznee and Cabul, you will act as you see fit,\r\n_and leave decisive proofs of the power of the British army,\r\nwithout impeaching its humanity_. You will bring away from the tomb\r\nof Mahmood of Ghuznee, his club, which hangs over it; and you will\r\nbring away the gates of his tomb, which are the gates of the Temple\r\nof Somnauth. _These will be the just trophies of your successful\r\nmarch_.\r\n\r\n\"You will not fail to disguise your intention of moving, and to\r\nacquaint Major-General Pollock with your plans as soon as you have\r\nformed them. _A copy of this letter will be forwarded to\r\nMajor-General Pollock to-day; and he will be instructed, by a\r\nforward movement, to facilitate your advance_; but he will probably\r\nnot deem it necessary to move any troops actually to Cabul, where\r\nyour force will be amply sufficient to beat any thing the Affghans\r\ncan oppose to it. The operations, however, of the two armies must be\r\ncombined upon their approach, so as to effect, with the least\r\npossible loss, the occupation of Cabul, and keep open the\r\ncommunications between Cabul and Peshawar.\r\n\r\n\"One apprehension upon my mind is, that, in the event of your\r\ndeciding upon moving on Jellalabad, by Ghuznee and Cabul, the\r\naccumulation of so great a force as that of your army, combined with\r\nMajor-General Pollock's, in the narrow valley of the Cabul river,\r\nmay produce material difficulties in the matter of provisions and\r\nforage; but every effort will be made from India to diminish that\r\ndifficulty, should you adopt that line of retirement.\r\n\r\n\"This letter remains absolutely secret. I have, &c.\r\n\r\n\"ELLENBOROUGH.\"\r\n\r\nA paltry attempt was made in Parliament by Lord John Russell to\r\nrepresent this despatch as intended to defraud General Nott of his\r\nmilitary trophies in the event of success, and to relieve the\r\nGovernor-General of responsibility in the event of failure. No such\r\nbase construction can be put upon it. Lord Ellenborough was doing his\r\nown duty as a civil minister, and leaving General Nott to do _his_\r\nas a military commander. A military responsibility lay on General\r\nNott, from which no ruler could relieve him; but the military glory\r\nwas his also, if he felt himself justified in choosing the path of\r\nhonour that was opened to him. Who grudges the triumphs that General\r\nNott and his companions-in-arms have achieved? Not certainly Lord\r\nEllenborough or his friends. Let the distinctions which have been\r\nheaped on the Indian army and its leaders answer that question. But\r\nis their military merit a reason for denying to the man, under whose\r\nadministration these victories were won, the high honour of having\r\ndone all which a civil governor could do, to direct and assist the\r\narmies of his country? Let each receive the praise of his own merits,\r\nand we doubt not that military men, wherever, at least, they have\r\nexperienced the reverse, will be the first to appreciate and commend,\r\nin Lord Ellenborough's administration, that active sympathy and\r\nassistance which are so essential to military efficiency and success.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the despatch of the 4th of July is qualified by\r\nheavy cautions. And should it not have been so? In addressing a\r\nBritish officer with a field of exertion before him, so glorious in\r\na military, so hazardous in a political view, it is surely not the\r\nspur, but the curb, that a civilian was called on to apply. The\r\ncourage of such a commander required nothing to fan the flame: The\r\ndanger, if any, was rather that he would rashly seize the\r\nopportunity afforded him, than that he would timidly resign it; and\r\nif he was not prepared to adopt the bolder course, in the face of\r\nall the hazards which attended it, it was best that the enterprize\r\nshould not be undertaken at all.\r\n\r\nBut Lord Ellenborough knew his man. In appointing General Nott, in\r\nMarch, to the command of all the troops, and entrusting him with the\r\ncontrol of all the agents in Lower Affghanistan, the Governor and\r\nCouncil had desired him \"to rely upon our constant support, and upon\r\nour placing the most favourable interpretation upon all the measures\r\nhe may deem it necessary to adopt in the execution of our orders.\"\r\nAnd in now giving him the option of retiring by Cabul, Lord\r\nEllenborough was assured that the General needed no other\r\nencouragement to avail himself of it, than the feeling that all\r\ncounter-considerations had been stated and duly weighed. Every\r\npreparation was immediately made to support General Nott in his\r\nadventurous enterprize; and Lord Ellenborough writes to General\r\nPollock:--\r\n\r\n\"I am in hopes that Major-General Nott will to-day be in possession\r\nof my letter of the 4th instant, and that you will, very soon after\r\nyou receive this letter, be made acquainted with the Major-General's\r\nintentions. _My expectation is_, that Major-General Nott will feel\r\nhimself sufficiently strong, and be sufficiently provided with\r\ncarriage, to march upon Ghuznee and Cabul.\"\r\n\r\nThe result was such as had been looked for. The combined operation\r\nof the two armies placed the Affghans at our mercy, and terminated,\r\nby the ample vindication of our honour, and the restoration of our\r\nimprisoned friends, our inauspicious connexion with these barbarians,\r\nwho had retaliated so cruelly the aggression we had made upon them.\r\n\r\nIt may be safely conjectured, that if these final triumphs had been\r\nachieved under the direction of Lord Auckland, even though merely\r\nretrieving the errors of his former policy, we should never have\r\nheard an end of the eulogiums pronounced upon him. Lord John Russell\r\nwould have crowed and clapped his wings in the \"moment of victory.\"\r\nLord Palmerston would have blustered more brazenly than ever.\r\nMr. Macaulay would have aired the whole stores of his panegyrical\r\nvocabulary; and Sir John Hobhouse would not have gone abroad.\r\n\r\nBut, under whatever Government achieved, these results would have\r\nfilled the minds of patriotic men with unmingled gratitude to all\r\nwho had contributed to their accomplishment. India had been in danger,\r\nand was safe. The British arms had been stained by defeat, and were\r\nagain glancing brightly in the light of victory. Our countrymen and\r\ncountrywomen had been almost hopeless captives, and were now\r\nrestored to freedom and their friends. In such a scene and season of\r\nrejoicing, we might have thought that none but a Whig of the very\r\noldest school of all, could have entertained any feelings but those\r\nof generous sympathy and unrepining satisfaction. But limits cannot\r\neasily be put to human perverseness. The party whose policy had\r\ncaused the evils from which we and they have been delivered, felt\r\nnothing but intense hatred to him who had been most prominent in\r\nthat deliverance; and, heedless of the good that he had done, they\r\nfastened on what seemed to their malignant and microscopic vision\r\nsome specks that chequered his otherwise unblemished administration\r\nof affairs.\r\n\r\nThe idea of discussing in Parliament, as we have lately witnessed,\r\nthe literary style of a Government state paper at a crisis so\r\nmomentous, implies a levity that would be hateful if it were not\r\nludicrous. But there is something peculiarly laughable in the\r\npedantry of such criticism. When other men are thinking of what has\r\nbeen done, the reviewers and poetasters of the Whig Opposition can\r\nthink only of what has been said. The facts that are before them\r\nhave no value in their eyes; they see nothing but the phraseology.\r\nFrom men who had themselves done nothing but what was mischievous,\r\nthis is perhaps natural. They are content, possibly, if they have\r\nnever said a foolish thing, to have never done a wise one; though we\r\nare doubtful if a taunt about simplicity of composition, either\r\ncomes well from the noble leader of the Whigs, or his friends, when\r\nwe remember some of their old achievements in addressing their\r\nsupporters. But in the peculiar position of the Whigs, with ignominy\r\nand impeachment suspended over their heads for their Affghan errors,\r\nwe think that such a course is as becoming as if a condemned\r\ncriminal were to carp at the literary composition of his own reprieve.\r\n\r\nThe tactics of the Whigs in their move against Lord Ellenborough, had\r\nall the craft of conscious weakness. First, they postponed their\r\nmotion from time to time, till they were rescued by their opponents\r\nfrom Mr. Roebuck's assault upon them. Then they arranged their\r\nattack for the same night in both Houses of Parliament, lest\r\nexplanations in any high quarter in the one might damage a future\r\ndiscussion in the other; and lastly, though thus acting by\r\nsimultaneous and concerted movements in both, they framed their\r\nmotions differently in each place; and in the Commons, where they had\r\nsome dream of better success, confined themselves to the religious\r\nquestion under the letter on the Somnauth gates, omitting the Simla\r\nproclamation of the 1st October, which they knew neither\r\nConservative nor Radical would join them to condemn.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Somnauth gates, a pettier piece of hypercriticism,\r\nand a more palpable exhibition of hypocrisy, were never witnessed on\r\na public question. Two things on this point are as plain as day.\r\n\r\n1. That in retiring from the Affghan country, we were called upon to\r\ndo so as much as possible in the light of triumphant victors,\r\nbearing every mark of military prowess and superiority that could\r\nreadily be assumed, and inflicting as heavy a blow, and as severe a\r\ndiscouragement on our perfidious enemies, as humanity would permit.\r\n\r\n2. That, the Affghan trophies of Mahmoud's success were treasured up\r\nby his nation as an assurance of continued ascendancy over their\r\nHindoo neighbours; and that, in particular, the redelivery to India\r\nof these very gates of Somnauth, were, in negotiations of recent date,\r\ndemanded by Runjeet Singh as an inestimable boon, and deprecated by\r\nShah Soojah as a degrading humiliation.\r\n\r\nKeeping in view these undeniable circumstances, it is clear that the\r\nseizure of these Somnauth gates was appropriately ordered as a\r\npalpable and permanent demonstration of conquest, and one eminently\r\ncalculated to encourage the Indian army, and to depress their enemies.\r\n\r\nThat these gates were connected with the religion of the country, is\r\nof no relevancy in this matter. Every thing relating to Hindoo\r\ngrandeur is more or less interwoven with religion; but we must take\r\nthings as they are. We are the rulers of Hindostan; where the vast\r\npreponderance of our subjects and soldiers are Hindoos. We wish them\r\nto be Christians, but they are not so yet; and, until they become\r\nChristianized, we cannot hope or wish that they should forget the\r\nonly faith which they have to raise them above the earth they tread.\r\nTheir religion is corrupted to the core; but in its primitive type,\r\nafter which its worshippers will sometimes even yet aspire, it is\r\nnot destitute of a high spirituality that would seek to assimilate\r\nand unite men's souls to the Great Being, whom they reverence as the\r\nmaker, maintainer, and changer of the universe. Hindooism is more\r\nfantastic, and less pleasingly endeared to us, than the paganism of\r\nGreece, but it is scarcely more lax or licentious; yet if Fortune,\r\nin its caprices, had ordained our Indian subjects to be heathen\r\nGreeks, with a Whig Governor-General bringing them back in triumph\r\nto their homes, Lord Palmerston, who now, in a mingled rant of\r\nmythology, and methodism, talks of \"Dii and Jupiter hostis,\" would\r\nhimself have penned a paragraph about the restored temple of Mars or\r\nVenus, and would have held up the scruples of Sir Robert Inglis and\r\nMr. Plumptre to classical ridicule.\r\n\r\nBut it is plain that here no religious triumph was, or could have\r\nbeen, contemplated by Lord Ellenborough. On this point we need no\r\nother evidence than that of Joseph Hume, who, combining the\r\nproperties of Balaam and his ass, often brays out a blessing when he\r\nintends a curse. He tells us that--\r\n\r\nA Hindoo of high caste, now in this country, the Vakeel of the Rajah\r\nof Sattara, had written to him a letter, in which he stated--\r\n\"It appears to me that the restoration of the gates of Somnauth\r\ncould have no reference either to the support or degradation of any\r\nreligious faith. To restore the gates to their original purpose is\r\nimpracticable by the tenets of the Hindoo religion. Their doctrine is,\r\nthat any thing, when in contact with a dead body, or any thing\r\nbelonging to it, whether tomb or garment, is utterly contaminated and\r\nunfit for religious purposes. In my opinion, therefore, the\r\nproclamation must have been intended to gratify the feelings of the\r\nHindoo portion of our army, by removing a stain which the western\r\nportion of India had long felt oppressive. In fact, he believed that\r\nthe Governor-General, by this means, conciliated the feelings of the\r\nHindoo soldiery in their return from those scenes of death and\r\ndisaster in which they had behaved so well, and where thousands of\r\ntheir fellow-countrymen had fallen. I hope that this intention of\r\nLord Ellenborough to conciliate the princes of India will extend to\r\nmy unfortunate master.' This letter was from (we believe) Rumgoo\r\nBaffagee, Vakeel of the Rajah of Sattara, and he thought it was so\r\nimportant, that he had sent for the Vakeel, whom he found a most\r\nintelligent man; and from his conversation he (Mr. Hume) was\r\nsatisfied that, so far from being applied to the Hindoo population\r\nexclusively, it was utterly impossible that the gates could be used\r\nfor the religious purposes to which the Governor-General seemed to\r\nhave destined them. He had satisfied him (Mr. Hume) that the object\r\nof the proclamation was merely to bring back to Western India those\r\ngates, the absence of which in Afghanistan had long been felt as an\r\nopprobrium. He hoped therefore, that those religious sects who had\r\nmost unnecessarily take the alarm on this score, would be appeased.\r\nSo far from the proclamation being an exclusive one, no single\r\nsentence was there in it which could be read after the address to\r\n'_all_ the princes and chiefs, and people of India,' as applicable\r\nto any one.\"\r\n\r\nBut it is said that such a trophy may give offence to Mahommedans;\r\nand Mr. Mangles tells us, that the Mohommedan population sympathize\r\nstrongly with the Affghans, and revere the memory of Mahmoud. If\r\nthat be the case, it would have been difficult to bring any trophy\r\nhome, or to imprint any mark of the superiority of our arms, without\r\ndispleasing this sect. But, in that view, who are the parties\r\nresponsible for thus placing our essential interests, and the safety\r\nof India generally, in contrast with the feelings of  Mohommedan\r\nsubjects? Those certainly who, regardless of all justice, made a\r\nwanton aggression on a Mahommedan power. Those certainly who,\r\nregardless of all prudence, gave occasion to the Affghan massacre\r\nand captivity of British and Indian soldiers; and, by a great\r\nMahommedan success, kindled a spark which was ready to set the\r\nfreemasonry of Islamism on fire \"from Morocco to Coromandel.\" If we\r\nhave been placed in a false position, as regards our Mahommedan\r\nsubjects, we have to blame the Whigs, whose wanton and unwise\r\nmeasures created this collision of interests, and not Lord\r\nEllenborough, who has adopted measures the most natural and the most\r\nhumane, to reestablish the ascendancy and the reputation of English\r\nand Indian power.\r\n\r\nThe proclamation of Simla needs no vindication. It has satisfied\r\nevery one but the Whigs, who can never forget and never forgive it.\r\nIt is poor pretence to say, that it denounces in an indecorous\r\nmanner the errors of the previous governor. It does no such thing.\r\nIt speaks, indeed, of errors, but only conscious culpability would\r\nhave taken the allusion to itself. There were errors, and grievous\r\nones. The Whigs themselves must say that; and they have not been\r\nslow to shift to the shoulders of military officers the results that\r\nmost people think they should bear themselves. The proclamation of\r\nLord Ellenborough seems to us to have been framed with a punctilious\r\ndesire to reconcile in the eyes of India his own policy with that\r\nwhich had been avowed by his predecessor, and to ascribe the change\r\nof plans to a change of circumstances, and not of principles. We\r\nspeak here of the avowed policy of his predecessor; for Lord Auckland,\r\nat least, pretended that he had no aggressive or hostile views\r\nagainst the Affghans, and no desire for a permanent occupation of\r\ntheir country. The real designs of the Whig Government are a\r\ndifferent thing; and with these, as avowed by Lord Palmerston in\r\nParliament, the intentions of Lord Ellenborough were wholly\r\nirreconcilable.\r\n\r\nLet us listen here to one who knows the subject. The Duke of\r\nWellington tells us the errors that Lord Ellenborough alludes to as\r\noccasioning our military disasters, and he shows us where those\r\nerrors lay:--\r\n\r\n\"There is not a word in this proclamation that is not strictly\r\ntrue. But I do not blame the noble lord opposite, the late\r\nGovernor-General of India; yet I cannot help looking _at the enormous\r\nerrors_ which have been committed from the commencement of these\r\ntransactions in which these disasters originated, down to the last\r\nretreat from Cabul--I say, looking at all this, I still must blame,\r\nnot the late Governor-General, but the gentlemen who acted under him.\r\nIn the first place, I attribute the error to the gentleman who fell\r\na victim to his own want of judgment. The army unfortunately was\r\npartly English and partly Hindoo--not Affghans, but Hindoos. What\r\nwas the consequence? To maintain the whole system of the government,\r\nincluding the collection of the revenue, devolved upon that army.\r\nAll the details of the government were carried on through the agency\r\nof that English and Hindoo army, and eventually it became necessary\r\nto support that army with some troops in the service of the Company.\r\nNow, the gentleman who was responsible for this ought to have known\r\nthat there was one rule, the violation of which any one acquainted\r\nwith the government of India knew nothing could justify, and that was,\r\nthe employment of the Company's European troops in the collection of\r\nthe revenue. That rule is invariably laid down, and is invariably\r\nobserved. That, as your lordships must plainly see, is one of the\r\nerrors that has been committed. There is another point to which I\r\nwish to call your attention; it is this, that the country never had\r\nbeen occupied by an army as it ought to have been occupied. With the\r\nnorth no practicable communication was maintained--no practicable\r\ncommunications were kept up between Shikarpore, Candahar, and Ghuznee.\r\nThe passes were held only through the agency of banditti. I do not\r\nblame the noble lord, but I blame the gentleman to whom the army was\r\nentrusted. He seemed never to have looked at what had been done by\r\nformer commanders in similar circumstances. Any officer who has the\r\ncommand of an army ought to feel it to be his first duty to keep up\r\na communication with his own country. If such communication had been\r\nmaintained, those disasters never would have befallen us--they could\r\nnot have happened. This was one of the errors committed; but I do\r\nnot say that the noble lord opposite is answerable for that error.\r\nNot only was no communication kept up with the north, but none was\r\nkept up with the south. Neither the Kojuck nor the Bolan pass was\r\nkept open. Can that, my lords, be called a military communication?\r\nCould such a state of things exist? Why, was not this another\r\nerror--a gross error? The noble lord opposite (Lord Auckland) had no\r\nmore to do with this than I have. Sir W. Macnaghten, the gentleman\r\nwho perished, could not have been ignorant of what was done in other\r\nplaces. He must have read the history of the Spanish war, and he\r\nmust have recollected how the French conducted themselves in a\r\nsimilar situation; how they fortified the passes, and secured their\r\ncommunications. But he was not an officer; the gentleman at the head\r\nof the army in Affghanistan was not an officer--that was another\r\nerror.\"\r\n\r\nThat such errors existed is undeniable. Lord Auckland says there\r\nwere errors:--\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the errors of the campaign, he conceived they rested\r\nwith the military commanders, not with Sir W. Macnaghten; and if\r\nerrors had been committed by Sir William, they must be shared\r\nbetween him and the more direct military commanders.\"\r\n\r\nLord John Russell said,--\r\n\r\n\"I have heard causes given, and upon very high authority, for these\r\ndisasters; I have heard it stated that very great errors were\r\ncommitted--that those errors consisted partly in not keeping up a\r\ncommunication by the straightest road between Cabul and Peshawar.\r\nThis may be just; these may be errors, but they are errors not\r\nnecessary or in any way connected with the policy of entering into\r\nAffghanistan. I may mention another circumstance--that the\r\nexpedition into Affghanistan was undertaken under Lord Keane, who was\r\nshortly after succeeded by Sir W. Cotton; he came home, and was\r\nsucceeded by General Elphinstone, who, from the time of assuming the\r\ncommand, never appears to have been in the state of vigorous health\r\nnecessary for such a position. Are not these circumstances to be\r\ntaken into account? If my Lord Auckland had had at his disposal any\r\nof those illustrious men who had honoured the British army in later\r\ndays--if such a man as Lord Keane had remained in Cabul--my\r\npersuasion is, you would never have heard of such a disaster as that\r\nwhich took place at Cabul.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall leave the Whigs to settle the question with their\r\nsubordinates, as to the precise degree of blame which each of the\r\nparties shall bear. But there is seldom blame with the servants\r\nwithout blame in the master; and it is one of Lord Ellenborough's\r\njust titles to our praise, that he has been ably served by the\r\nofficers whom he so ably supported.\r\n\r\nIf our Affghan disasters were imputable to gross errors in detail,\r\nwas it not right to denounce the cause? It would have been a\r\nmelancholy thing if we had been thus betrayed and circumvented\r\nwithout errors in our own servants. If British troops had been thus\r\ncut off, notwithstanding the use of every prudent precaution, the\r\ndisasters would then have gone far to put in question the\r\ninvincibility of our military power. It was necessary to declare,\r\nthat by individual and special mal-arrangement, this unparalleled\r\ndisaster had arisen; so that none of our enemies should thence\r\nderive a hope to crush us again, until at least the incompetent\r\nofficials of a confiding Whig Government should give them another\r\nsuch opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe proclamation of Simla had another purpose--that of announcing\r\nthe future policy of the Government, and repudiating those designs of\r\naggression and aggrandizement which there was too good ground for\r\nimputing to us, and which could not fail to inspire distrust and\r\nsuspicion in the minds even of friendly neighbours. On this point\r\nnothing can be added to the admirable exposition of Lord Fitzgerald\r\nin the late debate:--\r\n\r\n\"But there were other circumstances which compelled the\r\nGovernor-General of India; he meant, which made it his duty to\r\nproclaim the motives of the policy of the Government; and why?\r\n--because a different policy had been proclaimed by his predecessor;\r\nand when it became necessary to withdraw from Affghanistan, it was\r\nnecessary to show that this was not a retreat. We were compelled to\r\nshow that we were not shrinking from setting up a king, because we\r\ncould not sustain him there. He said it was the duty of the\r\nGovernor-General to make that known to the Indian public. He would\r\nnot attempt to shelter Lord Ellenborough in this respect, by\r\nsaying--'it was prudent,' or, 'it did no harm:'--he maintained it\r\nwas his duty. What had been the language of the late Ministers of the\r\nCrown, in the last session of Parliament? And these debates, as the\r\nnoble Earl had well said, 'went forth to India;' the discussions in\r\nthat House went forth to the Indian public. He found one Minister of\r\nthe Crown saying--'He should like to see the Minister, or the\r\nGovernor of India, who would dare to withdraw from the position we\r\noccupied in Affghanistan.' (Hear, hear.) He found another noble lord,\r\nin another place, stating, 'they took credit for the whole of that\r\nmeasure, and he trusted that at no time would that position in\r\nAffghanistan be abandoned.' These were views of public policy which\r\nwent forth to India, and it was not inconvenient nor unjust that\r\nthose who administered the government of India on different\r\nprinciples should proclaim their views. The noble earl opposite,\r\nknew that at that period it was not intended altogether to confine\r\nthe operations of the army to the westward of the Indus. It was very\r\nwell to say, that it was unwise and impolitic, and calculated to\r\ndestroy the unanimity which was so essential to the Government of\r\nIndia, to issue public information as to the reasons for the\r\nwithdrawal of an army, although its advance was heralded by a\r\ndeclaration on all these points, because the withdrawal of an army\r\nwas supposed to terminate the operations; but in the eyes of India\r\nand Asia, if the declaration of the noble earl, dated from Simla on\r\nthe same day of the same month of a preceding year, had remained as\r\na record of British policy after that declaration had been followed\r\nby a campaign, brilliant at its commencement, but as delusive as\r\nbrilliant, and terminated by a most awful tragedy, and by the\r\ngreatest disaster that ever befell the British forces--was it\r\nunbecoming in a Governor-General to state, that the views and policy\r\nof the Government of India had changed, and that the Government no\r\nlonger wished to interfere in the policy of Affghanistan, its motives\r\nfor so doing having passed away on finding that the king,\r\nrepresented to be so popular, was unpopular? But there was another\r\ncircumstance which called for Lord Ellenborough's declaration, namely,\r\nthe necessity of allaying the apprehensions and fears of other states;\r\nand it was Lord Ellenborough's duty to do this. Had the Sikhs no\r\napprehensions with respect to our intentions on Lahore? The most\r\nserious apprehensions had been stated by the Durbar of Lahore to our\r\npolitical agent there, Mr. Clark, and had been represented by him to\r\nthe Government of India.--Other states also had entertained\r\napprehensions of the intentions and motives of the Indian Government,\r\nand he had yet to learn that it was a fault in a Governor-General to\r\nallay these apprehensions of native states, even if no precedent\r\ncould be found for such a proceeding. After the policy of the Indian\r\nGovernment which had been proclaimed, it became Lord Ellenborough's\r\nduty to take the step he had done.\"\r\n\r\nThis, however, is the true _gravamen_ of the quarrel of the Whigs\r\nwith Lord Ellenborough. He has thrown overboard their aggressive\r\npolicy--that policy which Lord Auckland, indeed, had not in words\r\navowed in India, but which his friends at home had openly declared\r\nand gloried in. It was necessary for Lord Ellenborough, by a frank\r\ndeclaration of his intentions, to exclude the prevalent\r\nsuspicion--nay, the universal belief--of those projects of\r\nencroachment which the Whig Government had countenanced. This was\r\nthe unkindest cut of all.\r\n\r\n  \"Ill-weaved ambition! how much art\r\n  thou shrunk!\"\r\n\r\nIt was hard that their Affghan laurels--the only wreaths of victory\r\nthat the Whigs had ever won--should have already withered on their\r\nbrow. It was hard that their disasters should have been retrieved\r\nunder the sway of a political opponent. But it was intolerable that\r\nthe plans of conquest which they had fondly cherished, and tried to\r\npress upon the country, should be virtually denounced amid the\r\nuniversal approbation of all good men at home and abroad; that the\r\nsolitary achievement of their administration in military affairs,\r\nshould be recorded in the page of history, only to be condemned as\r\nan act of injustice, inexcusably undertaken, and incompetently\r\nexecuted: and relinquished by their successors in the very hour of\r\ntriumph, with a wise self-denial which no one will suspect that a\r\nWhig could have ever practised.\r\n\r\nThe cloven foot has here too plainly been revealed. It is not this\r\nphrase or that procession in particular that has displeased the Whigs.\r\nIt is the abandonment of a policy which they dared not proclaim in\r\nIndia, and which they could not justify in England. They are always\r\nhankering after it still. Mr. Vernon Smith: \"Considered it most\r\nabsurd for any Governor General to declare publicly that our Indian\r\nempire had reached the limits which nature had assigned to it. Why,\r\nwhat were the limits which nature had assigned to our Indian empire?\r\nIn early days, the Mahratta ditch was said to be its natural limit;\r\nand why was the Sutlej or the Indus to be more the boundary of our\r\nempire than the Himalayas?\"\r\n\r\nEven Lord John Russell, who _now_ acknowledges the wisdom of\r\nsurrendering Affghanistan, declares, in almost so many words, that\r\nhis party have shrunk from a general vote of censure because they\r\ncould not properly put it, and have chosen this Act as \"not the worst,\"\r\nbut the most convenient to attack. What the other errors of Lord\r\nEllenborough are, or whether there are any, except the exploded\r\nstory of the incivility to Mr. Amos, is nowhere definitely,\r\ndiscoverable in their discussions, and is not likely for some time\r\nto assume a greater degree of consistency than vague Whig calumnies\r\nand general Whig dissatisfaction. Let them come to something definite,\r\nand see how they will fare. If, as their old friend Lord Brougham\r\nsaid, \"revelling in defeat, and intoxicated with failure,\" they know\r\nnot when they have had enough--if they desire a contest on some other\r\nissue--let them name their day and abide the result.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we would only observe, what a contrast the conduct of\r\nthe Whig party towards Lord Ellenborough exhibits to that of their\r\nopponents towards Lord Auckland! The ex Governor-General is not\r\nabsent, but here to defend himself; and every one sees how much room\r\nthere is for assailing his measures. Their calamitous result would\r\nof itself go far to support the charge of imprudence, or something\r\nworse. But not a word has been said against him that could be avoided;\r\nand even those statements that necessarily reflect upon his\r\ndiscretion, have been extorted from the Conservative party, in reply\r\nto the attacks which Lord Auckland's friends have made upon his\r\nsuccessor. The English people admire fair play as much as they\r\nappreciate the value of practical benefits. They see the false\r\npretences on which an absent man has now been assailed by\r\ndisappointed opponents; they feel the generosity that has saved his\r\nrival from retaliation. They know the state of Indian affairs when\r\nLord Ellenborough assumed his office, and they can estimate the\r\nposition into which they have now been brought under his vigorous\r\nmanagement. They agree with him in the pacific principles which he\r\nhas avowed, and look forward to a continued career of useful services,\r\nin which the resources of that great empire will be more than ever\r\ndeveloped under his control, and the power of the British name\r\nperpetuated by a wise, an upright, and a fearless Administration.",
