If a farmer is not mechanically inclined, he is under the\r\nnecessity of employing someone who is.\r\n\r\nSome farms are supplied with a great many handy contrivances to save\r\nlabor. Farmers differ a great deal in this respect. Some are natural\r\nmechanics, some learn how to buy and how to operate the best farm\r\nmachinery, while others are still living in the past.\r\n\r\nSome farmers who make the least pretensions have the best machinery and\r\nimplements. They may not be good mechanics, but they have an eye to the\r\nvalue of labor saving tools.\r\n\r\nThe object of this book is to emphasize the importance of mechanics in\r\nmodern farming; to fit scores of quick-acting machines into the daily\r\nroutine of farm work and thereby lift heavy loads from the shoulders of\r\nmen and women; to increase the output at less cost of hand labor and to\r\nimprove the soil while producing more abundantly than ever before; to\r\nsuggest the use of suitable machines to manufacture high-priced\r\nnutritious human foods from cheap farm by-products.\r\n\r\nIllustrations are used to explain principles rather than to recommend\r\nany particular type or pattern of machine.\r\n\r\nThe old is contrasted with the new and the merits of both are expressed.\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                               PAGE\r\n  CHAPTER I\r\n  THE FARM SHOP WITH TOOLS FOR WORKING WOOD AND IRON              9\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II\r\n  FARM SHOP WORK                                                 50\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER III\r\n  GENERATING MECHANICAL POWER TO DRIVE MODERN FARM MACHINERY     74\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IV\r\n  DRIVEN MACHINES                                               100\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER V\r\n  WORKING THE SOIL                                              137\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VI\r\n  HANDLING THE HAY CROP                                         163\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VII\r\n  FARM CONVEYANCES                                              179\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VIII\r\n  MISCELLANEOUS FARM CONVENIENCES                               197\r\n\r\n  INDEX                                                         241\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFARM MECHANICS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE FARM SHOP WITH TOOLS FOR WORKING WOOD AND IRON\r\n\r\n\r\nFARM SHOP AND IMPLEMENT HOUSE\r\n\r\nThe workshop and shed to hold farm implements should look as neat and\r\nattractive as the larger buildings. Farm implements are expensive. Farm\r\nmachinery is even more so. When such machinery is all properly housed\r\nand kept in repair the depreciation is estimated at ten per cent a year.\r\nWhen the machines are left to rust and weather in the rain and wind the\r\nloss is simply ruinous.\r\n\r\nMore machinery is required on farms than formerly and it costs more.\r\nStill it is not a question whether a farmer can afford a machine. If he\r\nhas sufficient work for it he knows he cannot afford to get along\r\nwithout it and he must have a shed to protect it from the weather when\r\nnot in use.\r\n\r\nIn the first place the implement shed should be large enough to\r\naccommodate all of the farm implements and machinery without crowding\r\nand it should be well built and tight enough to keep out the wind and\r\nsmall animals, including chickens and sparrows.\r\n\r\nThe perspective and plan shown herewith is twenty-four feet in width and\r\nsixty feet in length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 1.--Perspective View of the Farm Shop, Garage and\r\nImplement Shed. The doors to the right are nearly 12 feet high to let in\r\na grain separator over night, or during the winter, or a load of hay in\r\ncase of a sudden storm.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--Floor Plan of Shop, Garage and Storage. The\r\nbuilding is 60 feet wide and 24 feet from front to back. The doors of\r\nthe garage and tool shed are made to open full width, but 8 feet is wide\r\nenough for the shop door. All doors open out against posts and are\r\nfastened to prevent blowing shut. The work shop is well lighted and the\r\nstationary tools are carefully placed for convenience in doing repair\r\nwork of all kinds. The pipe vise is at the doorway between the shop and\r\ngarage so the handles of the pipe tools may swing through the doorway\r\nand the pipe may lie full length along the narrow pipe bench.]\r\n\r\nThe doorways provide headroom sufficient for the highest machines, and\r\nthe width when the double doors are opened and the center post removed\r\nis nearly twenty feet, which is sufficient for a binder in field\r\ncondition or a two-horse spring-tooth rake.\r\n\r\nOne end of the building looking toward the house is intended for a\r\nmachine shop to be partitioned off by enclosing the first bent. This\r\ngives a room twenty feet wide by twenty-four feet deep for a blacksmith\r\nshop and general repair work. The next twenty feet is the garage. The\r\nmachine shop part of the building will be arranged according to the\r\nmechanical inclination of the farmer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--Perspective View of Farm Implement Shed and\r\nWorkshop.]\r\n\r\nA real farm repair shop is a rather elaborate mechanical proposition.\r\nThere is a good brick chimney with a hood to carry off the smoke and\r\ngases from the blacksmith fire and the chimney should have a separate\r\nflue for a heating stove. Farm repair work is done mostly during the\r\nwinter months when a fire in the shop is necessary for comfort and\r\nefficiency. A person cannot work to advantage with cold fingers. Paint\r\nrequires moderate heat to work to advantage. Painting farm implements\r\nis a very important part of repair work.\r\n\r\nA good shop arrangement is to have an iron workbench across the shop\r\nwindow in the front or entrance end of the building. In the far corner\r\nagainst the back wall is a good place for a woodworking bench. It is too\r\nmussy to have the blacksmith work and the carpenter work mixed up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--Floor Plan of Farm Implement Shed, showing the\r\nworkshop in one end of the building, handy to the implement storage\r\nroom.]\r\n\r\nSometimes it is necessary to bring in a pair of horses for shoeing, or\r\nto pull the shoes off. For this reason, a tie rail bolted to the\r\nstudding on the side of the shop near the entrance is an extra\r\nconvenience.\r\n\r\nIn a hot climate a sliding door is preferable because the wind will not\r\nslam it shut. In cold climates, hinge doors are better with a good sill\r\nand threshold to shut against to keep out the cold. Sometimes the large\r\ndoor contains a small door big enough to step through, but not large\r\nenough to admit much cold, when it is being opened and shut. Likewise a\r\nceiling is needed in a cold country, while in warmer sections, a roof is\r\nsufficient. Farm shops, like other farm buildings, should conform to\r\nthe climate, as well as convenience in doing the work. A solid concrete\r\nfloor is a great comfort. And it is easily kept clean.\r\n\r\nThe perspective and floor plan show the arrangement of the doors,\r\nwindows and chimney and the placing of the work benches, forge, anvil,\r\ntoolbench and drill press.\r\n\r\nFigures 3 and 4 show the perspective and floor plan of a farm shop and\r\nimplement house 40 x 16 feet in size, which is large enough for some\r\nfarms.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHOP TOOLS\r\n\r\nGood tools are more important on a farm than in a city workshop for the\r\nreason that a greater variety of work is required.\r\n\r\n_Measuring Mechanical Work._--In using tools on the farm the first rule\r\nshould be accuracy. It is just as easy to work to one-sixteenth of an\r\ninch as to carelessly lay off a piece of work so that the pieces won't\r\ngo together right.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5.--Caliper Rule. A handy slide caliper shop rule\r\nis made with a slide marked in fractions of inches as shown in the\r\ndrawing. The diameter of a rivet, bolt or other round object may be\r\ntaken instantly. It is not so accurate as calipers for close\r\nmeasurements, but it is a practical tool for farm use.]\r\n\r\nThe handiest measuring tool ever invented is the old-fashioned two-foot\r\nrule that folds up to six inches in length to be carried in the pocket.\r\nSuch rules to be serviceable should be brass bound. The interior marking\r\nshould be notched to sixteenths. The outside marking may be laid out in\r\neighths. The finer marking on the inside is protected by keeping the\r\nrule folded together when not in use. The coarser marking outside does\r\nnot suffer so much from wear. Figure 5 shows a 12-inch rule with a slide\r\ncaliper jaw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6.--Small Pocket Oilstone. Shop oilstone in a box.\r\n100-foot measuring tapeline marked in inches, feet and rods.]\r\n\r\nIn using a two-foot rule to lay off work the forward end should contain\r\nthe small figures so that the workman is counting back on the rule but\r\nforward on the work, and he has the end of the rule to scribe from. In\r\nlaying off a 16-foot pole the stick is first marked with a knife point,\r\nor sharp scratchawl, and try square to square one end. The work is then\r\nlaid off from left to right, starting from the left hand edge of the\r\nsquare mark or first mark. The two-foot rule is laid flat on top of the\r\npiece of wood. At the front end of the rule the wood is marked with a\r\nsharp scratchawl or the point of a knife blade by pressing the point\r\nagainst the end of the rule at the time of marking. In moving the rule\r\nforward the left end is placed exactly over the left edge of the mark,\r\nso the new measurement begins at the exact point where the other left\r\noff, and so on the whole length of the stick. The final mark is then\r\nmade exactly sixteen feet from the first mark.\r\n\r\nIn sawing the ends the saw kerf is cut from the waste ends of the stick.\r\nThe saw cuts to the mark but does not cut it out.\r\n\r\nIn using a rule carelessly a workman may gain one-sixteenth of an inch\r\nevery time he moves the rule, which would mean half of an inch in laying\r\noff a 16-foot pole, which would ruin it for carpenter work. If the pole\r\nis afterwards used for staking fence posts, he would gain one-half inch\r\nat each post, or a foot for every twenty-four posts, a distance to\r\nbother considerably in estimating acres. It is just as easy to measure\r\nexactly as it is to measure a little more or a little less, and it marks\r\nthe difference between right and wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOODWORKING BENCH\r\n\r\nIn a farm workshop it is better to separate the woodworking department\r\nas far as possible from the blacksmith shop. Working wood accumulates a\r\ngreat deal of litter, shavings, blocks, and kindling wood, which are in\r\nthe way in the blacksmith shop, and a spark from the anvil might set the\r\nshavings afire.\r\n\r\nA woodworking bench, Figure 7, carpenter's bench, it is usually called,\r\nneeds a short leg vise with wide jaws. The top of the vise should be\r\nflush with the top of the bench, so the boards may be worked when lying\r\nflat on the top of the bench. For the same reason the bench dog should\r\nlower down flush when not needed to hold the end of the board.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to make carpenter's benches separate from the shop, and\r\nlarge enough to stand alone, so they may be moved out doors or into\r\nother buildings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 7.--Carpenter's Bench. A woodworking bench is 16'\r\nlong, 3' 6\" wide and 32\" high. The height, to be particular, should be\r\nthe length of the leg of the man who uses it. Lincoln, when joking with\r\nStanton, gave it as his opinion that \"a man's legs should be just long\r\nenough to reach the ground.\" But that rule is not sufficiently definite\r\nto satisfy carpenters, so they adopted the inside leg measurement. They\r\nclaim that the average carpenter is 5' 10\" tall and he wears a 32\" leg.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 8.--Carpenter's Trestle, or Saw-Bench. The top\r\npiece is 4 x 6 and the legs are 2 x 4. There is sufficient spread of leg\r\nto prevent it from toppling over, but the legs are not greatly in the\r\nway. It is heavy enough to stand still while you slide a board along. It\r\nis 2 feet high.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 9.--Shave Horse. For shaping pieces of hardwood\r\nfor repair work. A good shave horse is about 8' long and the seat end is\r\nthe height of a chair. The head is carved on a hardwood stick with three\r\nprojections to grip different sized pieces to be worked.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 10.--Compasses, Wooden Clamp and Cutting Pliers.]\r\n\r\nCarpenter benches may be well made, or they may be constructed in a\r\nhurry. So long as the top is true it makes but little difference how the\r\nlegs are attached, so long as they are strong and enough of them. A\r\ncarpenter bench that is used for all kinds of work must be solid enough\r\nto permit hammering, driving nails, etc. Usually the top of the bench is\r\nstraight, true and level and it should be kept free from litter and\r\nextra tools.\r\n\r\nGood carpenters prefer a tool rack separate from the bench. It may stand\r\non the floor or be attached to the wall. Carpenter tools on a farm are\r\nnot numerous, but they should have a regular place, and laborers on the\r\nfarms should be encouraged to keep the tools where they belong.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 11.--Monkey-Wrenches are the handiest of all farm\r\nwrenches, but they were never intended to hammer with. Two sizes are\r\nneeded--an eight-inch for small nuts and a much larger wrench, to open\r\ntwo inches or more, to use when taking the disks off the shafts of a\r\ndisk harrow. A large pipe-wrench to hold the round shaft makes a good\r\ncompanion tool for this work.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWOODWORKING TOOLS\r\n\r\nEvery farmer has an axe or two, some sort of a handsaw and a nail\r\nhammer. It is astonishing what jobs of repair work a handy farmer will\r\ndo with such a dearth of tools. But it is not necessary to worry along\r\nwithout a good repair kit. Tools are cheap enough.\r\n\r\nSuch woodworking tools as coarse and fine toothed hand saws, a good\r\nsquare, a splendid assortment of hammers and the different kinds of\r\nwrenches, screw clamps, boring tools--in fact a complete assortment of\r\nhandy woodworking tools is an absolute necessity on a well-managed\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nThe farm kit should contain two sizes of nail hammers, see Figure 15,\r\none suitable to drive small nails, say up to eight penny, and the other\r\nfor large nails and spikes; a long thin-bladed handsaw, having nine\r\nteeth to the inch, for sawing boards and planks; a shorter handsaw,\r\nhaving ten teeth to the inch, for small work and for pruning trees. A\r\npruning saw should cut a fine, smooth kerf, so the wound will not\r\ncollect and hold moisture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 12.--Hand Saw. This pattern, both for cross cut\r\nand rip saw, has been adopted by all makers of fine saws. Nine teeth to\r\nthe inch is fine enough for most jobs on the farm.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 13.--Keyhole Saw with point slim enough to start\r\nthe cut from a half-inch auger hole.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 14.--Bramble Hook for trimming berry bushes and\r\ncleaning out fence corners. It has a knife-edge with hooked sawteeth.]\r\n\r\nFarmers' handsaws are required to do a great many different kinds of\r\nwork. For this reason, it is difficult to keep them in good working\r\ncondition, but if both saws are jointed, set and filed by a good\r\nmechanic once or twice a year, they may be kept in usable condition the\r\nrest of the time by a handy farm workman, unless extra building or\r\nspecial work is required.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 15.--Nail Hammers. Two styles. The upper hammer is\r\nmade with a ball peen and a round face. It is tempered to drive small\r\nnails without slipping and shaped to avoid dinging the wood. This hammer\r\nshould weigh 18 or 19 ounces, including the handle. The lower hammer is\r\nheavier, has a flat face and is intended for heavy work such as driving\r\nspikes and fence staples.]\r\n\r\nA long-bladed ripsaw is also very useful, and what is commonly termed a\r\nkeyhole saw finds more use on the farm than in a carpenter's shop in\r\ntown. It is necessary frequently to cut holes through partitions,\r\nfloors, etc., and at such times a keyhole saw works in just right.\r\n\r\nHandaxes are necessary for roughing certain pieces of wood for repair\r\njobs. Two sizes of handaxes for different kinds of work are very useful,\r\nalso a wide blade draw shave, Figure 16, and shave horse, Figure 9. A\r\nsteel square having one 24-inch blade and one 18-inch is the best size.\r\nSuch squares usually are heavy enough to remain square after falling off\r\nthe bench forty or fifty times. A good deal depends upon the quality of\r\nthe steel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 16.--Drawing-Knife with wide blade for finishing\r\nstraight surfaces.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 17.--Try-Square With Six-Inch Blade. Wood, brass\r\nand steel are the proper materials for a try-square. A double marking\r\ngauge for scribing mortises is also shown.]\r\n\r\nSteel squares differ in the measuring marks, but the kind to buy has one\r\nside spaced to sixteenths and the other side to tenths or twelfths. The\r\nsixteenth interest farmers generally, so that special attention should\r\nbe given this side of the square. The lumber rule on some squares is\r\nuseful, but the brace rules and mitre calculations are not likely to\r\ninterest farmers.\r\n\r\nScrew-drivers should be mostly strong and heavy for farm work. Three\r\nsizes of handled screw-drivers of different lengths and sizes, also two\r\nor three brace bit screw-drivers are needed. One or two bits may be\r\nbroken or twisted so the assortment is sometimes exhausted before the\r\nscrew is started.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 18.--Heavy Hand Axe for Use on the Shop Chopping\r\nBlock. A beet topping knife is shown also.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 19.--Heavy Screwdriver. The strongest and cheapest\r\nscrew-driver is made from a single bar of steel. The wooden handle is\r\nmade in two parts and riveted as shown.]\r\n\r\nPinch bars and claw bars are very useful in a farm tool kit. Farm\r\nmechanical work consists principally in repairing implements, machinery,\r\nfences and buildings. Always a worn or broken part must be removed\r\nbefore the repair can be made. A pinch bar twenty-four inches long,\r\nFigure 21, with a cold chisel end, and another bar eighteen inches long\r\nwith a crooked claw end, Figure 22, for pulling nails and spikes comes\r\nin very handy. These two bars should be made of the best octagon steel,\r\nseven-eighths of an inch in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 20.--(1) Ratchet Screwdriver. It does rapid work\r\nand will last a generation if carefully used. (2) Auger-Bit of the Side\r\nCutter Type. A full set is needed. They are not for boring into old\r\nwood. Running once against a nail ruins one of these bits.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 21.--Handspike. A wooden handspike or pry is about\r\nseven feet long by 3 inches thick at the prying end. In the North it is\r\nusually made from a hickory or an ironwood or a dogwood sapling. The\r\nbark is removed and the handle is worked round and smooth on the shave\r\nhorse. It is better to cut the poles in the winter when the sap is in\r\nthe roots. After the handspikes are finished they should be covered deep\r\nwith straw so they will season slowly to prevent checking.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 22.--Wrecking Bar for pulling nails and to pry\r\nbroken parts from other wreckage.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 23.--Carpenter's Level. For practical farm work\r\nthe level should be 24\" or 30\" long. Wood is the most satisfactory\r\nmaterial. The best levels are made up of different layers of wood glued\r\ntogether to prevent warping or twisting. For this reason a good level\r\nshould be carefully laid away in a dry place immediately after using.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 24.--(1) Snips for cutting sheet metal. (2)\r\nCarpenter's Level, iron stock.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 25.--Wood-Boring Twist Drill Bit. Twist drills for\r\nwood have longer points than drills for boring iron.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 26.--Pod-Bit. The fastest boring gimlet bits are\r\nof this pattern. They are made in sizes from to 1/8\" to 3/8\" and are\r\nintended for boring softwood.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 27.--Auger-Bits. For smooth boring the lip bits\r\nare best. The side cutters project beyond the cutting lips to cut the\r\ncircle ahead of the chips. For boring green wood the single-worm clears\r\nbetter than the double-worm bit.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 28.--Extension Boring Bits. The cutting lips may\r\nbe set to bore holes from 1/2\" to 3\" in diameter. They are used mostly\r\nin softwood.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 29.--Ship Auger. This shape auger is made with or\r\nwithout a screw point. It will bore straighter in cross-grained wood\r\nwithout a point.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 30.--Long Ship Auger.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 31.--Bridge Auger. The long handle permits the\r\nworkman to stand erect while boring. The home made handle is welded onto\r\nthe shank of a ship auger.]\r\n\r\nA wooden carpenter's level, Figure 23, two feet long, with a plumb glass\r\nnear one end, is the most satisfactory farm level, an instrument that is\r\nneeded a great many times during the year.\r\n\r\nGood brace bits are scarce on farms. They are not expensive, but farmers\r\nare careless about bits and braces. Two sizes of braces are needed, a\r\nsmall brace for small pod bits and twist drills, and a large ratchet\r\nbrace with a 6-inch crank radius for turning larger bits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 32.--Carpenter's Jointer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 33.--Fore-Plane. This style plane is preferred to\r\na regular jointer for most farm work.]\r\n\r\nTwist drill bits will bore both wood and iron, and they are not\r\nexpensive up to three-eighths inch or one-half inch. But for larger\r\nsizes from one-half inch to one inch the finest lip wood boring bits\r\nwill give the best satisfaction. Extension bits are used for boring\r\nholes larger than one inch. Two extension bits are better than one bit\r\nwith two lip cutters. They will bore holes in soft wood in sizes from\r\none inch to three inches.\r\n\r\nOther cutting tools such as jack plane jointer and smoothing plane, also\r\nan assortment of chisels, belong to the farm equipment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 34.--Tool Box of Socket Chisels and Gouges. The\r\nchisels are sized from 1/2\" to 2\" in width. The two chisels to the right\r\nshow different patterns.]\r\n\r\nAll cutting tools should be of the best design and the best steel. If\r\nthey are properly used and taken care of, the different jobs of repair\r\nwork can be handled quickly and to great advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\nFARM GRINDSTONE\r\n\r\nA grindstone may be gritty without being coarse so it will bite the\r\nsteel easily and cut it away quickly. A good stone is a very\r\nsatisfactory farm implement, but a greasy stone is a perpetual nuisance.\r\n\r\nThere are grindstones with frames too light. The competition to\r\nmanufacture and sell a grindstone for farm use at the cheapest possible\r\nprice has resulted in turning out thousands of grindstone frames that\r\npossess very little stability.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 35.--Grindstone. The speed of a grindstone varies\r\nwith the diameter of the stone. It should turn just fast enough to keep\r\na flow of water on the upper face surface. If the stone turns too slow\r\nthe water will run down; if too fast, it will fly off.]\r\n\r\nGrindstones should be kept under cover; the best stone will be injured\r\nby leaving it in the hot sun. The sun draws the moisture out of the\r\nupper side and leaves the lower side damp and soft so that in use the\r\nstone soon becomes flat sided. The wet side freezes in winter, which is\r\na disintegrating process.\r\n\r\nThe best stones, with good care, will become uneven in time. The remedy\r\nis to true them with a quarter-inch soft iron round rod used like a\r\nlathe tool over an iron rest placed close to the stone on a level with\r\nthe center of the stone. The rod is held against the stone in such a way\r\nas to cut away the high bumps and make the stone truly round. The stone\r\ncuts away best when it is dry. A small rod is better than a large rod.\r\nIt digs into the stone better and takes out a deeper bite. Large power\r\nstones in machine shops are trued up in this way frequently. Farm stones\r\noften are neglected until they wabble so badly that it is difficult to\r\ngrind any tool to an edge. If the grindstone is turned by a belt from an\r\nengine the work of truing may be done in a few minutes. If the stone is\r\nturned by hand the work of making it round takes longer and requires\r\nsome muscle, but it pays.\r\n\r\nThe face of a grindstone should be rounded slightly, and it should be\r\nkept so by grinding the tools first on one side of edge of the stone,\r\nthen on the other, with the cutting edge of the tool crosswise to the\r\nface of the stone.\r\n\r\nFor safety and to prevent a sloppy waste of water the stone should turn\r\naway from the operator.\r\n\r\nThe best way to keep a stone moist is by a trickle of water from an\r\noverhead supply. Troughs of water suspended under the stone are\r\nunsatisfactory, because the water soon gets thick and unfit for use.\r\nSuch troughs are forgotten when the job is done, so that one side of the\r\nstone hangs in the water. An overhead supply of water leaks away and no\r\ndamage is done.\r\n\r\nGrindstone frames are best made of wood 3\" x 4\" thoroughly mortised\r\ntogether and well braced with wooden braces and tied across with plenty\r\nof iron rods. A good grindstone frame could be made of angle iron, but\r\nmanufacturers generally fail in the attempt.\r\n\r\nThere are good ball-bearing grindstone hangers on the market, both for\r\nhand crank stones and for belt use.\r\n\r\nThe belt is less in the way if it is brought up from below. This is not\r\ndifficult to do. A grindstone turns slower than any other farm machine\r\nso a speed reducing jack may be bolted to the floor at the back of the\r\ngrindstone a little to one side to escape the drip. This arrangement\r\nrequires a short belt but it may have the full face width of the pulley\r\nas the tight and loose pulleys are on the jack shaft.\r\n\r\n_Emery Grinders._--There are small emery wheels made for grinding disks\r\nthat work quickly and cut an even bevel all around. They are made in\r\npairs and are attached to the ends of a mandrel supported by a metal\r\nstand which is bolted to a bench. The same rig is used for sickle\r\ngrinding and other farm jobs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 36.--Emery Grinder. The illustrations show two\r\nkinds of grinding that double emery wheels are especially adapted to. To\r\ngrind a mowing-machine knife it is necessary to reverse. By placing the\r\nrest opposite the center between the two wheels the bevel will be the\r\nsame on both sides, or edges, of the section.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACKSMITH SHOP\r\n\r\nThe furniture in a blacksmith shop consists of forge, anvil, half\r\nbarrel, vise bench, drill press and tool rack. A farm shop also has a\r\nheating stove, shave horse, a woodworking bench, a good power driven\r\ngrindstone and a double emery grinder.\r\n\r\n_Forge._--The old-fashioned forge laid up with brick in connection with\r\nan old-fashioned chimney is just as popular as ever. The same old tuyer\r\niron receives the air blast from the same old style leather bellows, and\r\nthere is nothing more satisfactory. But there are modern portable\r\nforges, Figure 37, made of iron, that are less artistic, cheaper, take\r\nup less room and answer the purpose just about as well. The portable\r\niron forge has a small blower attached to the frame which feeds oxygen\r\ninto the fire. There are a good many different sizes of portable forges.\r\nMost of them work well up to their advertised capacity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 37.--Portable Forges. The smaller forge is for\r\nlight work such as heating rivets for iron bridge construction. The\r\nlarger forge to the right is meant for blacksmith work.]\r\n\r\nGenerally, farm forges are not required to develop a great amount of\r\nheat. Farmers do but little welding, most of the forge work on the farm\r\nbeing confined to repair work such as heating brace irons, so they may\r\nbe easily bent into the proper shape, or to soften metal so that holes\r\nmay be punched through it easily.\r\n\r\nSharpening harrow teeth, drawing out plow points and horseshoeing are\r\nabout the heaviest forge jobs required in a farm blacksmith shop, so\r\nthat a medium size forge will answer the purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 38.--Anvil. The only satisfactory anvil is forged\r\nout of ingot steel with a power trip-hammer. It should weigh 140\r\npounds.]\r\n\r\n_Anvil._--An anvil should weigh at least 120 pounds; 140 is better. It\r\nshould be set six feet from the center of the fire to the center of the\r\nanvil. It should be placed on a timber the size of the base of the anvil\r\nset three feet in the ground. The top of the anvil should be about\r\nthirty inches high. Holmstrom's rule is: \"Close the fist, stand erect\r\nwith the arm hanging down. The knuckles should just clear the face of\r\nthe anvil.\"\r\n\r\n_Bench and Vise._--The vise bench should be made solid and it should\r\nface a good light. The bench window should look to the east or north if\r\npossible. It should be about four feet high and eight feet long, with\r\nthe window sill about six inches above the bench.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 39.--(1) Shoeing Tool Box. The four small\r\ncompartments are for horseshoe nails of different sizes. There may be a\r\nleather loop for the paring knife. The low box end is for the shoeing\r\nhammer, rasp, nippers and hoof knife. (2) Blacksmith Tool Rack. Tongs,\r\nhandled punches and cutters are hung on the iron rails. Hammers are\r\nthrown on top. The lower platform is the shop catch-all.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 40.--Shoeing Knife. Good temper is the main\r\nqualification. All shoeing knives are practically the same shape,\r\nalthough they may vary in size.]\r\n\r\nTwo and one-half feet is the usual height for a workbench above the\r\nfloor. The best workbench tops are made by bolting together 2 x 4s with\r\nthe edges up. Hardwood makes the best bench, but good pine will last for\r\nyears. The top surface should be planed true and smooth after the nuts\r\nare drawn tight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 41.--Horseshoeing Rasp and Wood Rasp. These are\r\nnecessary tools in the farm shop.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 42.--Iron Work Bench. Solid is the first\r\nspecification for an iron shop bench. It should be three feet wide, not\r\nless than eight feet long and about 32 inches high. The top is made of 2\r\nx 4s placed on edge and bolted together. The supports are 2 x 6 bolted\r\nto the shop studding and braced back to the studding at the sill. The\r\nfront part of the bench is supported by iron legs made of gas-pipe with\r\nthreaded flanges at top and bottom. Heavy right angle wrought iron lugs\r\nare used to fasten the top of the bench to the studding. The foot of the\r\nvise leg is let into the floor of the shop or into a solid wooden block\r\nsunk in the ground.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 43.--Assortment of Files and Rasps needed in a\r\nfarm shop. (1) Slim three-cornered handsaw-file. (2) Common\r\nthree-cornered file suitable for filing a buck-saw. (3) Double-cut, or\r\nbastard, 10-inch flat file. (4) Single-cut, or mill file, either 10 or\r\n12 inches. (5) Half-round 10-inch wood rasp. (6) Horseshoer's rasp.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 44.--File Handle. Basswood makes the most\r\nsatisfactory file handles. They are fitted by carefully turning them\r\nonto the file shank to take the right taper. There should be a handle\r\nfor each file. The handle should be the right size and fitted straight\r\nwith the file so the file will take the same angle to the work when\r\nturned over.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 45.--Nail Set. On all wooden surfaces to be\r\npainted nails should be carefully driven with a round peen nail hammer\r\nand the heads sunk about one-eighth of an inch deep with a nail set. The\r\nholes may then be filled with putty and covered smoothly with paint.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 46.--Cold-Chisel. There are more flat cold-chisels\r\nthan all other shapes. They are easily made in the farm shop and it is\r\ngood practice. They are usually made from octagon steel. Different sizes\r\nare needed according to the work in hand. A piece of 5/8\" steel 6\" long\r\nmakes a handy cold-chisel for repair work.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 47.--Cape Cold-Chisel. It may be tapered both ways\r\nor one way to a cutting edge, or one edge may be rounded.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 48.--(1) Tinner's Punch. Made of octagon steel in\r\nsizes to fit the rivets. The cutting end is flat and has sharp edges\r\nmade by roll filing. It should be about 7\" long and from 3/8\" to 1/2\" in\r\ndiameter, according to the size of rivet and thickness of sheet metal to\r\nbe punched. (2) Prick Punch. Usually made rather short and stocky. It\r\nmay be 1/2\" or 5/8\" diameter and 4-1/2\" to 5\" long. (3) Hot-iron Punch.\r\nMade in many sizes and lengths. The taper should be the same as the\r\ndrawing.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 49.--(1) Blacksmith Vise. The old-fashioned leg\r\nvise is the most satisfactory for the blacksmith shop. It should have 5\"\r\njaws. (2) Power Post Drill. Belt power is practical for the post drill\r\nin a farm shop. The hand crank may be easily attached when needed.]\r\n\r\nThe bench vise should be heavy. A vise is used for bending iron hot from\r\nthe forge. Unless the jaws are large, the hot iron is likely to heat the\r\nvise sufficiently to draw the temper. Heavy jaws are solid enough to\r\nsupport the iron when it is being hammered. Often heavy hammers are used\r\nfor this purpose. A heavy vise holds the work solid, because it may be\r\nscrewed so much tighter than a light vise. A heavy vise will hold light\r\nwork, but a light vise will not hold heavy work. Heavy vises cost more,\r\nbut they are cheaper in the end and more satisfactory at all times. A\r\nleg vise with five-inch jaws weighs about sixty pounds; five and\r\none-half-inch jaws, eighty pounds. A machinist's vise is made to bolt\r\non top of the bench. It will answer for blacksmith work on the farm, but\r\nis not as good as the old-fashioned leg vise. A machinist's vise is very\r\nuseful in the garage, but it would hardly be necessary to have two heavy\r\nvises. The pipe vise belongs on a separate bench, which may be a plank\r\nbracketed against the side of the room.\r\n\r\n_Drill-Press._--The most satisfactory drill-press for use on a farm is\r\nthe upright drill that bolts to a post. There is usually a self feed\r\nwhich may be regulated according to the work. The heavy flywheel keeps\r\nthe motion steady, and because there is no bench in the way, wagon tires\r\nmay be suspended from the drill block, so they will hang free and true\r\nfor drilling. Often long pieces of straight iron are drilled with holes\r\nspaced certain distances apart. It is easier to pass them along when\r\nthey lie flat side down on the drill block. To use a drill properly and\r\nsafely, the chuck must run true. It is easy to break a drill when it\r\nwabbles.\r\n\r\nMost drills are made on the twist pattern, and it is something of a\r\ntrick to grind a twist drill, but anyone can do it if he tackles the job\r\nwith a determination to do it right. In grinding a twist drill, use a\r\nnew drill for pattern. Grind the angles the same as the new drill, and\r\nbe careful to have the point in the center. A little practice will make\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\nMechanics will say that no one except an expert should attempt to grind\r\na twist drill, but farmers who are mechanically inclined are the best\r\nexperts within reach. It is up to a farmer to grind his own drills or\r\nuse them dull.\r\n\r\nIn drilling wrought iron either water or oil is required to cool the\r\ndrill, but cast iron and brass are drilled dry. Light work such as\r\nhoop-iron may be drilled dry, but the cutting edge of the drill will\r\nlast longer even in light work if the drill is fed with oil or water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 50.--(1) Electric Drill-Press. A small electric\r\nmotor is attached to the drill spindle. (2) Tram Points. Two steel\r\npoints are fitted with thumbscrew clamps to fasten them to a long wooden\r\nbar. They are used to scribe circles too large for the compasses. (3)\r\nRatchet-Brace. Two braces, or bitstocks, are needed. A large brace with\r\na 6\" radius for large bits and a small brace with a 3\" or 3-1/2\" radius\r\nfor small bits.]\r\n\r\nIn using drill-presses, some extra attachments come in very handy, such\r\nas a screw clamp to hold short pieces of metal. Before starting the\r\ndrill, a center punch is used to mark the center of the hole to be\r\nbored and to start the drill in the right spot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 51.--Twist-Drills. Round shank for the post drill\r\nand square taper shank for brace work. Brace drills are small, 1/4\" or\r\nless.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 52.--Taper Reamer. Used to enlarge, or true, or\r\ntaper a hole that has been drilled or punched.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 53.--Another style of Reamer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 54.--Countersink. This is the old style,\r\nblacksmith-made, flat countersink. It will do quick work but not so\r\nsmooth as the fluted kind.]\r\n\r\nIn doing particular work, the drill may be re-centered when it starts\r\nwrong. This is done with a small round-nosed cold chisel. If the work\r\nis not very particular, the drill may be turned a little to one side by\r\nslanting the piece to be drilled. This plan is only a makeshift,\r\nhowever, the proper way being to block the work level, so that the drill\r\nwill meet it perpendicularly. However, by starting carefully, the hole\r\nmay be bored exactly as required.\r\n\r\n_Iron Working Tools._--Forge tools for a farm shop need not be numerous.\r\nSeveral pairs of tongs, one blacksmith hammer, one sledge, one hardy,\r\none wooden-handled cold chisel, one pair pincers, one paring knife, one\r\nshoeing rasp, and one shoeing hammer will do to begin with.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 55.--Machinist's Hammers. A medium weight should\r\nbe selected for farm repair work. It should be hung so the end of the\r\nhandle clears half an inch when the face rests flat on the bench.]\r\n\r\nMonkey-wrenches come first in the wrench department. The farmer needs\r\nthree sizes, one may be quite small, say six inches in length, one ten\r\ninches, and the other large enough to span a two-inch nut. And there\r\nshould be an ironclad rule, never use a monkey-wrench for a hammer. For\r\nwork around plows, cultivators, harvesters, and other farm machines, a\r\ncase of S wrenches will be greatly appreciated. Manufacturers include\r\nwrenches with almost all farm machines, but such wrenches are too cheap\r\nto be of much use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 56.--(1) Hardy. The anvil hardy is used more than\r\nany other anvil tool except the blacksmith's hammer and tongs. (2) A\r\nCold-Shut Link that may be welded, riveted or simply pounded shut.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 57.--Calipers: (1) A pair of tight-joint inside\r\ncalipers. (2) Its mate for taking outside dimensions. (3) A pair of\r\nspring-jointed, screw-adjustment inside calipers for machinists' use.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 58.--Blacksmith Tongs. Straight tongs made to hold\r\n3/8\" iron is the handiest size. Two or three pairs for larger sizes of\r\niron and one pair smaller come in handy.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 59.--(1) Wire Splicer. The oval openings in the\r\ntool are of different sizes. They are made to hold two wires, close\r\ntogether, with ends projecting in opposite directions. Each end is wound\r\naround the other wire. The ends are then notched with a three-cornered\r\nfile and broken off short and filed smooth. The splicing tool should be\r\nthin, about 1/8\" or 3/16\", to bring the two twists close together. This\r\nis especially necessary in making hoops for wooden pails. (2) Blacksmith\r\nShoeing Pincers, used to pull horseshoes. They should close together to\r\ncatch a nail by the head.]\r\n\r\nFor heavier work pipe-wrenches are absolutely necessary. The reason for\r\nhaving so many wrenches is to save time when in the field. It often\r\nhappens that men and horses stand idle waiting for what should be a\r\nquick repair job.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 60.--(1) Cotter Pin Tool. Handy for inserting or\r\nremoving all sorts of cotter keys. (2) Nest of S Wrenches of different\r\nsizes. Farmers have never appreciated the value of light, handy wrenches\r\nto fit all sorts of nuts and bolt heads closely.]\r\n\r\nFor bench work a riveting hammer and a ball peen machinist's hammer are\r\nneeded. A nest of S wrenches, two rivet sets, cold chisels, round\r\npunches and several files also are required.\r\n\r\nThe same twist drills up to three-eighths-inch will do for iron as well\r\nas wood. However, if much drilling is done, then round shank twist\r\ndrills to fit the drill chuck will work better. Farmers seldom drill\r\nholes in iron larger than one-half inch. For particular work, to get the\r\nexact size, reamers are used to finish the holes after drilling. Screw\r\nholes in iron are countersunk in the drill-press.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 61.--Hack Saw. One handle and a dozen blades. The\r\nframe should be stiff enough either to push or pull the saw without\r\nbinding. The teeth may point either way to suit the work in hand.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 62.--Powerful Bolt Cutter. It is intended for\r\nfactory use.]\r\n\r\nFor small work, twist drills with square shanks for brace use should\r\nrange in sizes from one thirty-second of an inch up to one-quarter inch,\r\nthen every one-sixteenth inch up to one-half inch.\r\n\r\nFor boring screw holes in wood the quickest work is done with pod bits.\r\nNot many sizes are needed, but they are cheap, so that a half dozen,\r\nranging from one-sixteenth to one-quarter inch or thereabouts, will be\r\nfound very useful. Pod bits belong to the wood department, but on\r\naccount of being used principally for screw sinking, they are just as\r\nuseful in the iron working department as in the carpenter shop.\r\n\r\nSheet metal snips for cutting sheet metal properly belong with the iron\r\nworking tools. Snips are from ten to fourteen inches in length. A medium\r\nsize is best for miscellaneous work. If kept in good working order\r\ntwelve-inch snips will cut 18-gauge galvanized or black iron. But a man\r\nwould not care to do a great deal of such heavy cutting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 63.--Cutting Nippers. For cutting the points from\r\nhorseshoe nails after they are driven through the hoof to hold the shoe\r\nin place. These nippers are hard tempered and should not be used for any\r\nother purpose.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 64.--Two Shapes of Steel Crowbars.]\r\n\r\n_Pipe-Fitting Tools._--Recent farm improvements require a few tools that\r\nrightfully belong to plumbers. Every farm has some kind of water supply\r\nfor domestic use and for live-stock. A great many farm machines require\r\npipe tools for repair work. Every year more plumbing reaches the farm.\r\n\r\nPlumbing work is no more difficult than other mechanical work, if the\r\ntools are at hand to meet the different requirements. One job of\r\nplumbing that used to stand out as an impossibility was the soldering\r\ntogether of lead pipes, technically termed \"wiping a joint.\" This\r\noperation has been discontinued. Every possible connection required in\r\nfarm plumbing is now provided for in standardized fittings. Every\r\npipe-fitting or connection that conducts supply water or waste water\r\nnowadays screws together. Sizes are all made to certain standards and\r\nthe couplings are almost perfect, so that work formerly shrouded in\r\nmystery or hidden under trade secrets is now open to every schoolboy who\r\nhas learned to read.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 65.--(1) Pipe Vise. Hinged to open for long pipes.\r\n(2) Machinist's Vise. Made with a turntable to take any horizontal\r\nangle. The pipe jaws are removable.]\r\n\r\nThe necessary outfit to handle all the piping and plumbing on the farm\r\nis not very expensive, probably $25.00 will include every tool and all\r\nother appliances necessary to put in all the piping needed to carry\r\nwater to the watering troughs and to supply hot and cold water to the\r\nkitchen and the bathroom, together with the waste pipes, ventilators and\r\nthe sewer to the septic tank. The same outfit of tools will answer for\r\nrepair work for a lifetime.\r\n\r\nFarm water pipes usually are small. There may be a two-inch suction pipe\r\nto the force pump, and the discharge may be one and a half inch. But\r\nthese pipes are not likely to make trouble.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 66.--Pipe Cutter. The most satisfactory pipe\r\ncutter has three knife-edge roller cutters which follow each other\r\naround the pipe. Some of these cutters have two flat face rollers and\r\none cutter roller to prevent raising a burr on the end of the pipe. The\r\nflat face rollers iron out the burr and leave the freshly cut pipe the\r\nsame size clear to the end.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 67.--Pipe-Wrench. This type of wrench is valuable\r\nfor working with the heavier farm implements. It is intended more for\r\nholding than for turning. It is rather rough on nuts. Damaged nuts show\r\nsigns of careless work.]\r\n\r\nThere should be a good pipe vise that will hold any size pipe up to\r\nthree inches. At least two pipe wrenches are needed and they should be\r\nadjustable from one-quarter-inch up to two-inch pipe.\r\n\r\nWe must remember that water pipe sizes mean inside measurements.\r\nOne-inch pipe is about one and one-quarter inches outside diameter.\r\nThree-quarter-inch pipe is about one inch outside. Two-inch pipe will\r\ncarry four times as much water as one-inch pipe, under the rule\r\n\"doubling the diameter increases the capacity four times.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 68.--A smaller sized wrench with wooden handle.]\r\n\r\nThe three-wheel pipe cutter works quickly and is satisfactory for most\r\njobs. Sometimes two of the knife wheels are removed and rollers\r\nsubstituted to prevent raising a burr on the end of the pipe.\r\n\r\nThreading dies are made in standard sizes. A good farm set consists of\r\nstock and dies to thread all the different sizes of pipe from\r\none-quarter inch to one inch, inclusive. Not many pipes larger than inch\r\nare threaded on the farm. They are cut to the proper lengths in the farm\r\nshop and the threads are cut in town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nFARM SHOP WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nPROFITABLE HOME REPAIR WORK\r\n\r\nEach farmer must be the judge in regard to the kind of mechanical repair\r\nwork that should be done at home and the kind and amount of repair work\r\nthat should go to the shop in town. A great deal depends on the\r\nmechanical ability of the farmer or his helpers. However, the poorest\r\nfarm mechanic can do \"first aid\" service to farm implements and\r\nmachinery in the nick of time, if he is so disposed. A great many\r\nfarmers are helpless in this respect because they want to be helpless.\r\nIt is so much easier to let it go than to go right at it with a\r\ndetermination to fix it, and fix it right.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 69.--Logging Chain. One of the cleverest farm\r\ninventions of any age is the logging chain. It is universally used in\r\nall lumber camps and on every farm. It usually is from 16 to 20 feet in\r\nlength, with a round hook on one end for the slip hitch and a grab hook\r\non the other end that makes fast between any two links.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 70.--Neckyoke and Whiffletree Irons. Farmers can\r\nmake better neckyokes and whiffletrees than they can buy ready-made. The\r\nirons may be bought separately and the wood selected piece by piece.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 71.--Measuring a Worn Skein for a New Boxing. The\r\npasteboard calipers are cut to fit the old skein sideways because it is\r\nprobably flattened on the bottom from wear.]\r\n\r\nOn general principles, however, farm repair work should not occupy a\r\nfarmer's time to the detriment of growing crops or the proper care of\r\nlive-stock. Farming is the business; mechanical work is a side issue. At\r\nthe same time, a farmer so inclined can find time during the year to\r\nlook over every farm machine, every implement and every hand tool on the\r\nfarm. The stupidest farm helper can clean the rust off of a spade and\r\nrub the surface with an oily cloth, in which some fine emery has been\r\ndusted. The emery will remove the rust and the oil will prevent it from\r\nfurther rusting. Every laborer knows better than to use a spade or\r\nshovel after a rivet head has given way so the handle is not properly\r\nsupported by the plate extensions. There really is no excuse for using\r\ntools or machinery that are out of repair, but the extent to which\r\na farmer can profitably do his own repairing depends on many\r\ncontingencies. In every case he must decide according to circumstances,\r\nalways, however, with a desire and determination to run his farm on\r\nbusiness principles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 72.--Wooden Wagon Axles. Axle timber may be bought\r\nin the rough or partly fitted to the skeins.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 73.--Showing how to fit the irons on the forward\r\nend of a wagon reach.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 74.--Wire Splice. With a little practice wire may\r\nbe wound close enough to prevent slipping.]\r\n\r\n_Home-made Bolts._--The easiest way to make a bolt is to cut a rod of\r\nround iron the proper length and run a thread on each end. On one end\r\nthe thread may be just long enough to rivet the head, while the thread\r\non the other end is made longer to accommodate the nut and to take up\r\nslack. A farmer needs round iron in sizes from one-fourth inch to\r\nfive-eighths inch. He will use more three-eighths and one-half inch than\r\nany other sizes. Blank nuts are made in standard sizes to fit any size\r\nof round iron. Have an assortment, in different sizes, of both the\r\nsquare and the hexagon nuts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 75.--Emergency Bolts. A bolt may be made quickly\r\nwithout a forge fire by cutting a short thread on one end for the head\r\nand a longer thread on the other end for the nut.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 76.--Rivets. A stock of soft iron rivets of\r\ndifferent sizes and lengths should be always kept on hand ready for\r\nimmediate use.]\r\n\r\nTo make a bolt in the ordinary way requires welding, but for repair work\r\nin a hurry it is better to select the proper iron and cut it to the\r\nrequired length either with a cold chisel in the vise, or with a hardy\r\nand a handled cold chisel over an anvil. The quickest way of cutting\r\nthat mashes the rod the least is to be preferred. The size of the rod\r\nwill determine the manner of cutting in most instances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 77.--Rivets.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 78.--Rivet Set. This style of set is used for\r\nsmall rivets. The size should be selected to fit the rivets closely.\r\nLarger rivets are made to hug the work by means of a flat piece of steel\r\nwith a hole through it.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 79.--Rivet Set.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 80.--(1) Coulter Clamp. Plow-beam clamps should be\r\nmade in the farm shop to fit each plow. (2) Garden Weeder. The quickest\r\nhand killer of young weeds in the garden is a flat steel blade that\r\nworks horizontally half an inch below the surface of the ground.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 81.--Stock and Dies. Taps and dies and stocks are\r\nbest kept in compartments in a case made for the purpose.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 82.--Stock for Round Dies.

Standard threads are tapped\r\ninto blank nuts and corresponding threads are cut onto bolts with\r\naccuracy and rapidity by using this style taps and dies. They may be had\r\nin all sizes. The range for farm work should cut from 1/4\" to 5/8\",\r\ninclusive.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 84.--Taper Tap for Blacksmith's Use.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 85.--Machine Bolt and Carriage Bolt. The first is\r\nused against iron and the second against wood, but this rule is not\r\narbitrary. The rounded side of the nuts are turned in against wood; the\r\nflat side against washers or heavier iron. Use square head bolts if you\r\nexpect to take them out after the nuts have rusted on.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 86.--Plow bolts and sickle bar bolts should be\r\nkept in stock. Standard sizes and shapes are made for several different\r\nmakes of plows and machines.]\r\n\r\nTaps and dies are made to fit each size of rod. If the thread on the\r\nbolt is cut with a solid, or round, plate die, the corresponding tap is\r\nrun clear through the nut. In that case the nut will screw on the bolt\r\neasily, possibly a little loose for some purposes. It is so intended by\r\nthe manufacturers to give the workman a little leeway. If it is\r\ndesirable to have the nut screw on the bolt very tight, then the tap is\r\nstopped before the last thread enters the nut. A little practice soon\r\nqualifies a workman to fit a nut according to the place the bolt is to\r\noccupy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 87.--Lag Screw. To set a lag screw in hardwood,\r\nbore a hole the size of the screw shank as calipered between the\r\nthreads.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 88.--(1) Wagon-Box Irons, showing how to attach\r\nthe box and the rave to the cross-piece and to brace the side of the box\r\nto hold it upright. There may be several of these braces on each side of\r\nthe wagon box. (2) U Bolt in Cement. A solid staple to be embedded in\r\nconcrete for a horse ring, door hinge, cow stanchion, etc.]\r\n\r\nGenerally it is desirable to have nuts fit very snug on parts of\r\nmachines that shake a good deal, and this applies to almost all farm\r\nmachinery and implements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 89.--Wagon-Box Brace. It is offset to hold the\r\nrave and to brace the sideboard at the rear and the front ends and\r\nsometimes in the middle of light wagon beds.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 90.--Two Plow Clevises and a Plow Link.]\r\n\r\nOrdinarily a horse rake is supposed to travel steadily along like a\r\ncart, but the ground is rough and in practical use the nuts loosen\r\nalmost as soon as haying commences.\r\n\r\nSome farmers make a practice of riveting bolt ends to prevent nuts from\r\nworking loose. When the bolts have square heads, this practice is not\r\nobjectionable, because with two wrenches a nut can be twisted off over\r\nthe riveting, but a great many bolts have round heads and very short,\r\nsquare shanks. Theoretically, the shanks are driven into the wood firm\r\nenough to prevent the bolts from turning. Practically this theory is a\r\ndelusion and a snare, as every farm boy can testify.\r\n\r\nBolts are not manufactured in quantities in the farm blacksmith shop.\r\nThey can be made by machinery cheaper, but so many times a bolt is\r\nneeded on short notice that the farm shop should have the necessary\r\ntools and materials to supply the need quickly.\r\n\r\n_Forging Iron and Steel._--Iron and steel are composed of the same\r\nproperties, but differ chemically. Steel also is finer grained than iron\r\nand it requires different treatment. Iron should be forged at a\r\nlight-red or white heat. If forged at a dark-red heat the iron generally\r\nwill granulate or crack open and weaken the metal. For a smooth finish\r\nthe last forging may be done at a dark-red heat, but the hammer must be\r\nused lightly. The weight of the hammer as well as the blows also must\r\ndiffer with the different size of iron under heat. Small sizes should be\r\ntreated with hammer blows that are rather light, while for large sizes\r\nthe blows should be correspondingly heavy. If light blows be given with\r\na light hammer in forging heavy iron the outside alone will be affected,\r\nthus causing uneven tension and contrarywise strain in the iron.\r\n\r\nSteel should never be heated above a yellow heat. If heated to a white\r\nheat the steel will be burned. Steel should never be forged at a\r\ndark-red heat. If this is done it will cause considerable strain between\r\nthe inner and outer portions, which may cause it to crack while forging.\r\nThe weight of the hammer and the hammer blows in forging of steel is\r\nvastly of more importance than in forging iron. If the blow or the\r\nhammer is not heavy enough to exert its force throughout the thickness\r\nof the steel it will probably crack in the process of hardening or\r\ntempering. If steel be properly forged it will harden easily and\r\nnaturally, but if improperly forged the tempering will be very\r\ndifficult--probably a failure. The quality of a finished tool depends\r\ngreatly upon the correct heat and proper method used in forging and\r\nhardening it.\r\n\r\n_Making Steel Tools._--Steel for tools should first be annealed to even\r\nthe density and prevent warping. This is done by heating it to a dull\r\ncherry red in a slow fire. A charcoal fire for this purpose is best\r\nbecause it contains no sulphur or other injurious impurities. After\r\nheating the piece of new steel all over as evenly as possible it should\r\nbe buried several inches deep in powdered charcoal and left to cool.\r\nThis completes the annealing process. While working steel into proper\r\nshape for tools, great care is required to prevent burning. It should be\r\nworked quickly and the process repeated as often as necessary. Practice\r\nis the only recipe for speed.\r\n\r\nWhen the tool is shaped as well as possible on the anvil it is then\r\nfinished with a file by clamping the new tool in the vise, using single\r\ncut files. Bastard files are too rough for tool steel. After the tool is\r\nshaped by cross-filing and draw-filing to make it smooth it is sometimes\r\npolished by wrapping fine emery cloth around the file. Oil is used with\r\nemery cloth to give the steel a luster finish. Tempering is the last\r\nprocess in the making of such tools as cold chisels, drills, dies,\r\npunches, scratchawls, etc.\r\n\r\n_Tempering Steel Tools._--Good judgment is required to get the right\r\ntemper. Good eyesight is needed to catch the color at the exact instant,\r\nand quick action to plunge it into the water before it cools too much.\r\nDies are made very hard. The color of the steel at dipping time should\r\nbe a bright straw color. Cold chisels will break when being used if\r\ntempered too hard. If cold chisels are to be used for cutting iron, the\r\ncolor should be violet; if the chisels are for cutting stone, purple is\r\nthe color. Drills for boring iron are tempered a dark straw color at the\r\ncutting edge merging back into blue. The water in the dipping tub should\r\nbe warm, as steel is likely to check or crack when it is tempered in\r\ncold water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 91.--Blacksmith Hammers. Some smiths use a heavy\r\nmachinist's hammer. But the flat peen is more useful when working around\r\nthe anvil and the leg vise.]\r\n\r\nTool steel should be held in a perpendicular position when it enters the\r\nwater to cool all sides alike. Otherwise the new tool might warp. It is\r\nbetter to dip slowly, sometimes holding the point, or cutting edge, in\r\nthe water while permitting the shank to cool slowly enough to remain\r\nsoft. Some sizes of steel may be tempered too hard at first and the\r\ntemper immediately drawn by permitting the heat of the shank to follow\r\ndown almost to the edge, then dip. This is done quickly while watching\r\nthe colors as they move towards the point or edge.\r\n\r\n_Draw-filing._--Making six-sided and eight-sided punches and scratchawls\r\nout of hexagon and octagon tool steel is interesting work. The steel is\r\ncut to length by filing a crease all around with a three-cornered file.\r\nWhen it is sufficiently notched, the steel will break straight across.\r\nTo shape the tool and to draw out the point the steel is heated in the\r\nforge to a dull cherry red and hammered carefully to preserve the shape\r\nalong the taper. Special attention must be given to the numerous\r\ncorners. A scratchawl or small punch, must be heated many times and\r\nhammered quickly before cooling. An old English shop adage reads: \"Only\r\none blacksmith ever went to the devil and that was for pounding cold\r\niron.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the punch or scratchawl is roughed out on the anvil, it is\r\nfastened in the vise and finished by cross-filing and draw-filing.\r\nCopper caps on the vise jaws will prevent indentations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 92.--Vise Jaw Guards. Soft auxiliary vise jaws are\r\nmade of sheet copper or galvanized iron.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 93.--Roll Filing. To file a piece of steel round\r\nit is rolled by one hand while the file is used by the other hand.]\r\n\r\nDraw-filing means grasping each end of the file and moving it back and\r\nforth sidewise along the work. For this purpose single-cut files are\r\nused. The smoothing is done with a very fine single-cut file, or if very\r\nparticular, a float file is used. Then the polish is rubbed on with fine\r\nemery cloth and oil. The emery cloth is wrapped around the file and the\r\nsame motion is continued. With some little practice a very creditable\r\npiece of work may be turned out. Such work is valuable because of the\r\ninstruction. A good test of skill at blacksmithing is making an octagon\r\npunch that tapers true to the eye when finished.\r\n\r\n_Set-Screws._--It is customary to fasten a good many gear wheels, cranks\r\nand pulleys to machinery shafts by set-screws. There are two kinds of\r\nset-screws; one has a cone point, the other a cup end. Both screws are\r\nhardened to sink into the shaft. A cup is supposed to cut a ring and the\r\npoint is supposed to sink into the shaft to make a small hole sufficient\r\nto keep the wheel from slipping. However, unless the cone-pointed screw\r\nis countersunk into the shaft, it will not hold much of a strain. The\r\npoint is so small it will slip and cut a groove around the shaft. To\r\nprevent this, the set-screw may be countersunk by first marking the\r\nshaft with an indentation of the point of the screw. Then the wheel or\r\ncrank or collar may be removed and a hole drilled into the shaft with a\r\ntwist-drill the same size, or a sixty-fourth smaller, than the\r\nset-screw. Then by forcing the end of the set-screw into the drill hole,\r\nthe wheel is held solid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 94.--Machine-Bolt and Set-Screw. The bolt to the\r\nleft is used to clamp cylinder heads in place. The set-screw to the\r\nright is the cup variety. The end is countersunk to form a cup with a\r\nsharp rim.]\r\n\r\nThe principal objection to set-screws is that they are dangerous. The\r\nheads always project and are ready to catch a coat sleeve when the shaft\r\nis revolving. In all cases, set-screws should be as large as the hub\r\nwill allow, and it is better to have them protected so it is impossible\r\nto catch anything to wind around the shaft. Cup set-screws are not\r\nsatisfactory except for very light work. If necessary to use them, the\r\nends may be firmly fixed by cutting a ring with a sharp, diamond-point\r\ncold chisel.\r\n\r\n_Setting the Handsaw._--Nine teeth to the inch is the most satisfactory\r\nhandsaw for all kinds of lumber. Setting the teeth of this kind of saw\r\nis best done with a hand lever set. The plunger pin should be carefully\r\nadjusted to bend the teeth just far enough to give the necessary set.\r\nFor general work a saw needs more set than is needed for kiln-dried\r\nstuff. The teeth should cut a kerf just wide enough to clear the blade.\r\nAnything more is a waste of time and muscle. It is better to work from\r\nboth sides of the saw by first setting one side the whole length of the\r\nblade. Then reverse the saw in the clamp and set the alternate teeth in\r\nthe same manner. There should be a good solid stop between the handles\r\nof the set to insure equal pressure against each sawtooth. The pin\r\nshould be carefully placed against each tooth at exactly the same spot\r\nevery time and the pressure should be the same for each tooth.\r\n\r\nThe best saw-sets for fine tooth saws are automatic so far as it is\r\npossible to make them so, but the skill of the operator determines the\r\nquality of the work. The reason for setting a saw before jointing is to\r\nleave the flattened ends of the teeth square with the blade after the\r\njointing and filing is completed.\r\n\r\n_Jointing a Handsaw._--After the saw has been set it must be jointed to\r\nsquare the teeth and to even them to equal length, and to keep the saw\r\nstraight on the cutting edge. Some woodworkers give their saws a slight\r\ncamber, or belly, to correspond with the sway-back. The camber\r\nfacilitates cutting to the bottom in mitre-box work without sawing into\r\nthe bed piece of the box. It also throws the greatest weight of the\r\nthrust upon the middle teeth. A saw with even teeth cuts smoother, runs\r\ntruer and works faster than a saw filed by guess. It is easy to file a\r\nsaw when all of the teeth are the same length and all have the same set.\r\nAnyone can do a good job of filing if the saw is made right to begin\r\nwith, but no one can put a saw in good working order with a\r\nthree-cornered file as his only tool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 95.--Saw Jointer. The wooden block is about two\r\ninches square by 12\" or 14\" in length. The block is made true and\r\nscribed carefully to have the ripsaw slot square, straight and true. The\r\nfile is set into a mortise square with the block.]\r\n\r\n_Filing the Handsaw._--First comes the three-cornered file. It should be\r\njust large enough to do the work. There is no economy in buying larger\r\nfiles thinking that each of the three corners will answer the same\r\npurpose as a whole file of smaller size. In the first place the small\r\nfile is better controlled and will do better work. In the second place\r\nthe three corners are needed to gum the bottoms of the divisions\r\nbetween the teeth. There is much more wear on the corners than on the\r\nsides of a saw-file. Also the corners of a small file are more acute,\r\nwhich means a good deal in the shape of the finished teeth.\r\n\r\nAfter the saw is carefully set and jointed, clamp it in the saw vise and\r\nfile one side of the saw from heel to point. Then reverse the saw in the\r\nsaw clamp and file the other side, being careful to keep the bevel of\r\neach tooth the same. It is better to stop filing just before the tooth\r\ncomes to a point. A triangular or diamond shaped point will cut faster\r\nand leave a smoother saw kerf and last longer than a needle point.\r\n\r\nAs the tooth of a crosscut saw is filed away from both edges, it is\r\nnecessary to make allowances when filing the first side, otherwise some\r\nof the teeth will come to a sharp point before the gumming is deep\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n_Using a Handsaw._--Anyone can saw a board square both up and down and\r\ncrossways by following a few simple rules. Have the board supported on\r\nthe level by two well made saw-benches 24\" high. Stand up straight as\r\npossible and look down on both sides of the saw blade. Use long even\r\nstrokes and let the saw play lightly and evenly through the saw cut.\r\n\r\nDo not cut the mark out; cut to it on the waste end, or further end, if\r\nthere are more pieces to be cut from the board. The saw kerf is about\r\n3/32\" wide for a nine-tooth saw set for unkilned lumber or dimension\r\nstuff. If both saw kerfs are taken from one piece and none from the next\r\nthen one length will be 3/16\" shorter than the other.\r\n\r\nFor practice it is a good plan to make two marks 3/32\" apart and cut\r\nbetween them. Use a sharp-pointed scratchawl to make the marks. A\r\npenknife blade is next best, but it must be held flat against the blade\r\nof the square, otherwise it will crowd in or run off at a tangent.\r\n\r\n_Setting a Circular Saw._--A good saw-set for a circular saw may be made\r\nout of an old worn-out flat file. Heat the file in the forge fire to\r\ndraw the temper and anneal it by covering it with ashes. Smooth it on\r\nthe grindstone. Put it in the vise and file a notch in one edge. The\r\nnotch should be just wide enough to fit loosely over the point of a\r\nsawtooth. The notch should be just deep enough to reach down one-quarter\r\nof the length of the tooth.\r\n\r\nMake a saw-set gauge out of a piece of flat iron or steel one inch wide\r\nand about four inches long. File a notch into and parallel to one edge\r\nat one corner, about one-sixteenth of an inch deep from the edge and\r\nabout half an inch long measuring from the end. With the home-made\r\nsaw-set bend the saw teeth outward until the points just miss the iron\r\ngauge in the corner notch. The edges of the gauge should be straight and\r\nparallel and the notch should be parallel with the edge. In use the edge\r\nof the gauge is laid against the side of the saw so the projecting tooth\r\nreaches into the notch. One-sixteenth of an inch may be too much set for\r\na small saw but it won't be too much for a 24-inch wood saw working in\r\ngreen cord wood.\r\n\r\n_Jointing a Circular Saw._--Run the saw at full speed. Lay a 14-inch\r\nfile flat on the top of the saw table at right angles to the saw. Move\r\nthe file slowly and carefully towards the saw until it ticks against the\r\nteeth. Hold the file firmly by both ends until each sawtooth ticks\r\nlightly against the file. A saw in good working order needs very little\r\njointing, but it should have attention every time the saw is set and it\r\nshould be done after setting and before filing.\r\n\r\n_Filing a Circular Saw._--The teeth of a crosscut circular saw point a\r\nlittle ahead. Sometimes they point so nearly straight out from the\r\ncenter that you have to look twice to determine which way the saw should\r\nrun. There are plenty of rules for the pitch of sawteeth, but they are\r\nsubject to many qualifications. What interests a farmer is a saw that\r\nwill cut green poles and crooked limbs into stove lengths with the least\r\npossible delay. A saw 20 inches in diameter will cut a stick eight\r\ninches through without turning it to finish the cut. The front or\r\ncutting edges of the teeth of a 24-inch crosscut circular saw for wood\r\nsawing should line to a point a little back from the center. This may\r\nnot sound definite enough for best results, so the more particular\r\nfarmers may use a straight edge. Select a straight stick about half an\r\ninch square. Rest it on top of or against the back of the saw mandrel\r\nand shape the forward edges of the teeth on a line with the upper side\r\nor rear side of the straight edge. The teeth will stand at the proper\r\npitch when the saw is new, if it was designed for sawing green wood. If\r\nit works right before being filed, then the width of the straight edge\r\nmay be made to conform to the original pitch and kept for future use.\r\n\r\nThe gumming is done with the edge of the file while filing the front\r\nedges of the teeth. It is finished with the flat side of the file while\r\nfiling the rear edges of the teeth. The depth, or length, of the teeth\r\nshould be kept the same as the manufacturer designed them. A wood saw\r\nworks best when the front edges of the teeth have but little bevel. The\r\nback edges should have more slant. The teeth should have three-cornered\r\nor diamond-shaped points. Needle points break off when they come against\r\nknots or cross-grained hardwood. Short teeth do no cutting. Single cut\r\nflat files are used for circular saws. The file should fit the saw. It\r\nshould be about 1/8\" wider than the length of the front side of the\r\nteeth. The back edges require that the file shall have some play to show\r\npart of the tooth while the file is in motion. Large files are clumsy.\r\nThe file should be carefully selected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 96.--How to Sharpen a Hoe. Grinding a hoe is\r\ndifficult, but filing it sharp and straight at the cutting edge is easy.\r\nIf the hoe chatters when held in the vise, spring a wooden block under\r\nthe blade. Use false vise jaws to prevent dinging the shank.]\r\n\r\n_How to Sharpen a Hoe._--It is quicker and more satisfactory to file a\r\nhoe sharp than to grind it on the grindstone. The shank of the hoe must\r\nbe held firmly in the vise and there should be a solid block of wood\r\nunder the blade of the hoe, a little back from the edge; to keep the\r\nfile from chattering. A single cut flat file is the best to use. It\r\nshould be long enough to be easily held in one position to make a\r\nsmooth, even bevel at the same angle to the face of the blade all the\r\nway across. To make sure not to file a feather edge it is better to\r\njoint the hoe to begin with, then to stop filing just before reaching\r\nthe edge. If the edge be left 1/64\" thick it will wear longer and work\r\nmore easily after having been used an hour or two than it will if the\r\nedge be filed thin. This is especially noticeable when the ground\r\ncontains small stones. Hoes are sharpened from the under side only. The\r\ninside of a hoe blade should be straight clear to the edge. Hoes should\r\nalways have sharp corners. When working around valuable plants you want\r\nto know exactly where the corner of the hoe is when the blade is buried\r\nout of sight in the ground.\r\n\r\n_Shoeing Farm Horses._--Farmers have no time or inclination to make a\r\nbusiness of shoeing horses, but there are occasions when it is necessary\r\nto pull a shoe or set a shoe and to do it quickly. Shoeing tools are not\r\nnumerous or expensive. They consist first of a tool box, with a stiff\r\niron handle made in the shape of a bale. The box contains a shoeing\r\nhammer, hoof rasp, hoof knife, or paring-knife, as it is usually called,\r\nand two sizes of horseshoe-nails. Sometimes a foot pedestal is used to\r\nset the horse's front foot on when the horse wants to bear down too\r\nhard, but this pedestal is not necessary in the farm shop.\r\n\r\nThere are flat-footed horses that cannot work even in summer without\r\nshoes. Common sense and shoeing tools are the only requirements\r\nnecessary to tack on a plate without calks. Shoes to fit any foot may be\r\npurchased at so much a pound.\r\n\r\nA paring-knife is used to level the bottom of the hoof so that it will\r\nhave an even bearing on the shoe all the way round. It is not desirable\r\nto pare the frog or the braces in the bottom of a horse's foot. If the\r\nfoot is well cupped, a little of the horny rim may be taken off near the\r\nedges. Generally it is necessary to shorten the toe. This is done partly\r\nwith the hoof chisel and rasp after the shoe is nailed fast. Sometimes\r\none-fourth of an inch is sufficient; at other times a horse's hoof is\r\nvery much improved by taking off one-half inch or more of the toe growth\r\neither from the bottom or the front or both.\r\n\r\nLike all other mechanical work the shoeing of a horse's foot should be\r\nstudied and planned before starting. A long toe is a bad leverage to\r\novercome when pulling a heavy load. At the same time, nature intended\r\nthat a horse should have considerable toe length as a protection to the\r\nmore tender parts of the foot. And the pastern bone should play at the\r\nproper angle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 97.--Tool Box for Field Use. The long open side is\r\nfor tools. On the other side of the center partition bolts, keys,\r\nscrews, nails, bits of wire, leather, tin, etc., are kept in the\r\ndifferent divisions.]\r\n\r\n_Handy Tool Box._--A tool box with a high lengthwise partition in the\r\nmiddle and a handle in the middle of the top of the partition is the\r\nhandiest tool box ever used on a farm. At haying and harvest time it\r\nshould be fitted with the common tools required about haying and harvest\r\nmachinery. One side is partitioned into square boxes to hold split wire\r\nkeys, washers, bolts, rivets, and a collection of wire nails, bits of\r\ncopper wire, a leather punch, etc. On the other side of the box is an\r\nassortment of wrenches, cold chisels, punches, pliers and hammers. This\r\ntool box belongs in the wagon that accompanies the outfit to the field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 98.--Melting Ladle. Babbitting shaft boxing\r\nrequires a melting ladle. It should be about five inches across the bowl\r\nand about three inches deep. That is a good size to heat in a forge\r\nfire.]\r\n\r\n_Babbitting Boxings._--Babbitting boxings is one of the repair jobs on\r\nthe farm. Some men are careless about oiling; sometimes sand cuts them\r\nout. Every year some boxings need rebabbitting. The melting ladle should\r\nbe large enough to pour the largest box. Usually a 5-inch bowl is about\r\nright. A large ladle will pour a small box but a small ladle won't pour\r\na large one. In cold weather the shaft and box should be warmed to\r\ninsure an even flow of metal. Pasteboard is fitted against the shaft\r\nwhen pouring the cap or top half of the box. Pasteboard is fitted around\r\nthe shaft at the ends of the box to keep the melted metal from running\r\nout. Never use clay or putty, it is too mussy and the babbitt is made\r\nrough and uneven at the edges. Some skill is required to fit either wood\r\nor metal close enough to prevent leaks and to do a neat job.\r\n\r\nIf the boxing is small, both top and bottom may be poured at once by\r\nmaking holes through the dividing pasteboard. The holes must be large\r\nenough to let the melted metal through and small enough to break apart\r\neasily when cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nGENERATING MECHANICAL POWER TO DRIVE MODERN FARM MACHINERY\r\n\r\n\r\nAt one time ninety-seven per cent of the population of the United States\r\ngot their living directly from tilling the soil, and the power used was\r\noxen and manual labor. At the present time probably not more than\r\nthirty-five per cent of our people are actively engaged in agricultural\r\npursuits. And the power problem has been transferred to horses, steam,\r\ngasoline, kerosene and water power, with electricity as a power\r\nconveyor.\r\n\r\nFifty years ago a farmer was lucky if he owned a single moldboard\r\ncast-iron plow that he could follow all day on foot and turn over one,\r\nor at most, two acres. The new traction engines are so powerful that it\r\nis possible to plow sixty feet in width, and other machines have been\r\ninvented to follow the tractor throughout the planting and growing\r\nseasons to the end of the harvest. The tractor is supplemented by\r\nnumerous smaller powers. All of which combine to make it possible for\r\none-third of the people to grow enough to feed the whole American family\r\nand to export a surplus to Europe.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the standard of living is very much higher than it was\r\nwhen practically everyone worked in the fields to grow and to harvest\r\nthe food necessary to live.\r\n\r\nFarm machinery is expensive, but it is more expensive to do without.\r\nFarmers who make the most money are the ones who use the greatest power\r\nand the best machinery. Farmers who have a hard time of it are the ones\r\nwho use the old wheezy hand pump, the eight-foot harrow and the walking\r\nplow. The few horses they keep are small and the work worries them. The\r\nowner sympathizes with his team and that worries him. Worry is the\r\ncommonest form of insanity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 99.--Flail, the oldest threshing machine, still\r\nused for threshing pedigreed seeds to prevent mixing. The staff is seven\r\nor eight feet long and the swiple is about three feet long by two and\r\none-half inches thick in the middle, tapering to one and one-half inches\r\nat the ends. The staff and swiple are fastened together by rawhide\r\nthongs.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 100.--Bucket Yoke. It fits around the neck and\r\nover the shoulders. Such human yokes have been used for ages to carry\r\ntwo buckets of water, milk or other liquids. The buckets or pails should\r\nnearly balance each other. They are steadied by hand to prevent\r\nslopping.]\r\n\r\nAt a famous plowing match held at Wheatland, Illinois, two interesting\r\nfacts were brought out. Boys are not competing for furrow prizes and the\r\nwalking plow has gone out of fashion. The plowing at the Wheatland\r\nplowing match was done by men with riding plows. Only one boy under\r\neighteen years was ready to measure his ability against competition. The\r\nattendance of farmers and visitors numbered about three thousand, which\r\nshows that general interest in the old-fashioned plowing match is as\r\nkeen as ever. A jumbo tractor on the grounds proved its ability to draw\r\na big crowd and eighteen plows at the same time. It did its work well\r\nand without vulgar ostentation. Lack of sufficient land to keep it busy\r\nwas the tractor's only disappointment, but it reached out a strong\r\nright arm and harrowed the furrows down fine, just to show that it\r\n\"wasn't mad at nobody.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 101.--Well Sweep. The length of the sweep is\r\nsufficient to lower the bucket into the water and to raise it to the\r\ncoping at the top of the brickwork. The rock on the short end of the\r\nsweep is just heavy enough to balance the bucket full of water.]\r\n\r\nModern farm methods are continually demanding more power. Larger\r\nimplements are being used and heavier horses are required to pull them.\r\nA great deal of farm work is done by engine power. Farm power is\r\nprofitable when it is employed to its full capacity in manufacturing\r\nhigh-priced products. It may be profitable also in preventing waste by\r\nworking up cheap materials into valuable by-products. The modern,\r\nwell-managed farm is a factory and it should be managed along\r\nprogressive factory methods. In a good dairy stable hay, straw, grains\r\nand other feeds are manufactured into high-priced cream and butter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 102.--Wire Stretcher. A small block and tackle\r\nwill stretch a single barb-wire tight enough for a fence. By using two\r\nwire snatches the ends of two wires may be strained together for\r\nsplicing.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 103.--Block and Tackle. The rope is threaded into\r\ntwo double blocks. There is a safety stop that holds the load at any\r\nheight.]\r\n\r\nFarming pays in proportion to the amount of work intelligently applied\r\nto this manner of increasing values. It is difficult to make a profit\r\ngrowing and selling grain. Grain may sell for more than the labor and\r\nseed, but it takes so much vitality from the land that depreciation of\r\ncapital often is greater than the margin of apparent profit. When grains\r\nare grown and fed to live-stock on the farm, business methods demand\r\nbetter buildings and more power, which means that the farmer is\r\nemploying auxiliary machinery and other modern methods to enhance\r\nvalues.\r\n\r\nIn other manufacturing establishments raw material is worked over into\r\ncommercial products which bring several times the amount of money paid\r\nfor the raw material.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 104.--Farm Hoists. Two styles of farm elevating\r\nhoists are shown in this illustration. Two very different lifting jobs\r\nare also shown.]\r\n\r\nThe principle is the same on the farm except that when a farmer raises\r\nthe raw material he sells it to himself at a profit. When he feeds it to\r\nlive-stock and sells the live-stock he makes another profit. When the\r\nmanure is properly handled and returned to the soil he is making another\r\nprofit on a by-product.\r\n\r\nFarming carried on in this way is a complicated business which requires\r\nsuperior knowledge of business methods and principles. In order to\r\nconduct the business of farming profitably the labor problem has to be\r\nmet. Good farm help is expensive. Poor farm help is more expensive.\r\nWhile farm machinery also is expensive, it is cheaper than hand labor\r\nwhen the farmer has sufficient work to justify the outlay. It is\r\ntiresome to have agricultural writers ding at us about the superior acre\r\nreturns of German farms. German hand-made returns may be greater per\r\nacre, but one American farmhand, by the use of proper machinery, will\r\nproduce more food than a whole German family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 105.--Two Powerful Winches. The one to the left is\r\nused for pulling small stumps or roots in the process of clearing land.\r\nThe rope runs on and off the drum to maintain three or four laps or\r\nturns. The winch to the right is used for hoisting well drilling tools\r\nor to hang a beef animal. The rope winds on the drum in two layers if\r\nnecessary.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDOG CHURN\r\n\r\nEven the dog works on some farms. A dog is a nuisance among dairy\r\ncattle, but he can be made to earn his salt at churning time. All\r\nmechanism in connection with dog power must be light. It also is\r\nnecessary to eliminate the friction as much as possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 106.--Dog Churn Power. A wheel keyed to an iron\r\nshaft is placed at an angle as shown. The weight of the dog turns the\r\nwheel and power is conveyed to the churn by a light rope belt. It is\r\nnecessary to confine the dog between stationary partitions built like a\r\nstall over the wheel.]\r\n\r\nThe best way to make a dog power is to use a light wooden sulky wheel\r\nfor the revolving turn table. Next best to the sulky wheel is a light\r\nbuggy wheel. The wheel is made fast to an upright iron shaft that is\r\nstepped into an iron oil well at the bottom and inclined at an angle of\r\nabout fifteen degrees to give the necessary power. To steady the top of\r\nthe shaft a light boxing is used, preferably a ball-bearing bicycle race\r\nto reduce friction. Power is conveyed to the churn by means of a grooved\r\npulley on the top of the shaft. A small, soft rope or heavy string belt\r\nruns from this pulley to a similar pulley connected with the churn.\r\n\r\nDogs learn to like the work when fed immediately after the churning is\r\nfinished. Dogs have been known to get on to the power wheel to call\r\nattention to their hungry condition. This calls to mind the necessity\r\nof arranging a brake to stop the wheel to let the dog off. When the\r\nwheel is running light, the dog cannot let go.\r\n\r\nA spring brake to wear against the iron tire of the wheel is the most\r\nsatisfactory. The brake may be tripped and set against the tire\r\nautomatically by a small lever and weight attached to the underside of\r\nthe wheel. When the speed is too fast the weight swings out and sets the\r\nbrake. When the speed slackens the weight drops back towards the center\r\nand releases the brake. When the speed is about right the weight swings\r\nbetween the two spring catches.\r\n\r\n\r\nBULL TREADMILL\r\n\r\nOn dairy farms it is common to see a valuable pure bred bull working a\r\ntreadmill for exercise and to pump water. Sometimes he turns the\r\ncream-separator, but the motion is too unsteady for good results.\r\nTreadmills for this purpose are very simple. The mechanism turns a\r\ngrooved pulley which propels a rope power conveyor. The rope belt may be\r\ncarried across the yards in any direction and to almost any distance.\r\nBull treadmills consist of a framework of wood which carries an endless\r\napron supported on rollers. The apron link chains pass around and turn\r\ntwo drumhead sprocket-wheels at the upper end and an idler drum at the\r\nlower end. The sprocket-wheel drum shaft is geared to an auxiliary shaft\r\nwhich carries a grooved pulley. A rope belt power conveyor runs in this\r\ngroove and carries power from the bull pen to the pump.\r\n\r\nBull tread powers usually have smooth inclined lags, because a bull's\r\nsteps on the tread power are naturally uneven and irregular. This\r\nconstruction gives an even straight tread to the travel surface. To\r\nprevent slipping, soft wooden strips are nailed onto the lags at the\r\nlower edges. Even incline tread blocks or lags are also recommended for\r\nhorses that are not shod and for all animals with split hoofs. The\r\ntraveling apron of the power is placed on an incline and the treads are\r\ncarried around the two drums at the upper and lower ends of the frame by\r\nmeans of endless chains. There is a governor attachment which regulates\r\nthe speed and prevents the machinery from \"running away.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 107.--Bull Tread Power. Treadmills have gone out\r\nof fashion. Too much friction was the cause, but a mill like this is\r\nvaluable to exercise a pure bred bull. Some dairymen make him pump\r\nwater.]\r\n\r\nThe simplest governor is made on the two-ball governor principle with\r\nweights on opposite levers. The governor is attached to two opposite\r\nspokes in the flywheel. As the speed increases the weights move outward\r\nbecause of their centrifugal force. This motion operates a brake lever\r\nto retard or stop the flywheel. When the machine stops an opposite\r\nweight rests against the flywheel until it starts in motion again, so\r\nthe apron cannot be moved until the brake is released. This is necessary\r\nto get the animal on or off of the platform while it is at rest to avoid\r\naccidents. The usual incline is a rise of two feet in eight when power\r\nis wanted. This pitch compels the bull to lift one-quarter of his own\r\nweight and it may be too severe for a heavy animal. The endless apron is\r\nan endless hill climb to the bull. Treadmills are not economical of\r\npower because there are so many bearings to generate friction.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINDMILLS\r\n\r\nWind power is the cheapest power we have. A windmill properly\r\nproportioned to its work is a great help, especially when it is attached\r\nto a good pump for the purpose of lifting water into an elevated tank\r\nfrom which it is piped under pressure for domestic purposes and for\r\nwatering live-stock.\r\n\r\nYou can have considerable patience with a windmill if you only depend\r\nupon it for pumping water, provided you have a tank that will hold a\r\nweek's supply to be drawn during a dry, hot time when every animal on\r\nthe farm demands a double allowance of water. That is the time when a\r\nfarmer hates to attach himself to the pump handle for the purpose of\r\nworking up a hickory breeze. That also is the time when the wind\r\nneglects a fellow.\r\n\r\nA good windmill is useful up to about one-third of its rated capacity,\r\nwhich is the strongest argument for buying a mill larger than at first\r\nseems necessary. Some men have suffered at some time in their lives with\r\nthe delusion that they could tinker with a poorly constructed windmill\r\nand make it earn its oil. They have never waked up to a full\r\nrealization of their early delusion. It is a positive fact that all\r\nwindmills are not lazy, deceitful nor wholly unreliable. When properly\r\nconstructed, rightly mounted and kept in good repair, they are not prone\r\nto work in a crazy fashion when the tank is full and loaf when it is\r\nempty. There are thousands of windmills that have faithfully staid on\r\nthe job continuously twenty-four hours per day for five or ten years at\r\na stretch, all the time working for nothing year after year without\r\ngrumbling, except when compelled to run without oil. At such times the\r\nprotest is loud and nerve racking.\r\n\r\nA good windmill with suitable derrick, pump and piping may cost $150.\r\nThe yearly expense figures something like this:\r\n\r\n  Interest on investment at 6% per annum   $ 9.00\r\n  Depreciation 10%                          15.00\r\n  Oil                                        1.00\r\n  Repairs                                    3.00\r\n\r\nmaking a total of $28, which is less than $2.50 per month for the work\r\nof elevating a constant supply of water for the house, stable and\r\nbarnyard.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE-MULE PUMP\r\n\r\nA home-made device that is much used on live-stock ranches in California\r\nis shown in the illustration. This simple mechanism is a practical means\r\nfor converting circular mule motion into vertical reciprocating pump\r\naction. A solid post is set rather deep in the ground about twelve feet\r\nfrom the well. This post is the fulcrum support of the walking-beam. One\r\nend of the walking-beam reaches to the center line of the well, where it\r\nconnects with the pump shaft. The other end of the walking-beam is\r\noperated by a pitman shaft connecting with a crank wrist pin near the\r\nground. A round iron shaft similar to a horsepower tumbling rod about\r\nten or twelve feet in length and one and a half inches in diameter is\r\nused to convey power and motion to the pitman shaft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 108.--Mule Pump. A practical home-made power to\r\npump water for live-stock. It is used where the water-table is within 20\r\nfeet of the surface of the ground. The drawing shows a post in the\r\ncenter which supports the walking-beam and acts as a fulcrum. A\r\nmowing-machine wheel is keyed to one end of a round iron shaft. The\r\nother end of this shaft turns in a boxing which is swiveled to a short\r\npost as shown at _B_. See also detail \"_B_.\". The two plunger shafts are\r\nshown at _A_ _A_. The mule is hitched to the round iron shaft near the\r\ntraveling wheel by means of a round hook. As the mule walks around in a\r\ncircle the shaft revolves and operates the crank _B_. There are side\r\nguys not shown in the drawing to keep the walking-beam in position.]\r\n\r\nA mowing-machine wheel is keyed to the outer end of the tumbling rod. At\r\nthe crank end is a babbitted boxing with a bolt attachment reaching down\r\ninto the top of a short post set solidly into the ground, directly under\r\nthe inner end of the walking-beam. This bolt permits the boxing to\r\nrevolve with a swivel motion. Another swivel connects the upper end of\r\nthe pitman shaft with the walking-beam. The whiffletree is attached to\r\nthe tumbling rod by an iron hook. This hook is held in place by two iron\r\ncollars fastened to the tumbling rod by means of keys or set-screws.\r\nThe mowing-machine drive wheel travels around in a circle behind the\r\nmule turning the shaft which works the walking-beam and operates the\r\npump. It would be difficult to design another horse or mule power so\r\ncheap and simple and effective. The mule grows wise after a while, so it\r\nis necessary to use a blindfold, or he will soldier on the job. With a\r\nlittle encouragement from a whip occasionally a mule will walk around\r\nand around for hours pulling the mowing-machine wheel after him.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSEPOWER\r\n\r\nOne horsepower is a force sufficient to lift 33,000 pounds one foot high\r\nin one minute.\r\n\r\nThe term \"horsepower\" in popular use years ago meant a collection of\r\ngear-wheels and long levers with eight or ten horses solemnly marching\r\naround in a circle with a man perched on a platform in the center in the\r\ncapacity of umpire.\r\n\r\nThis was the old threshing-machine horsepower. It was the first real\r\nsuccess in pooling many different farm power units to concentrate the\r\ncombined effort upon one important operation.\r\n\r\nNot many horses are capable of raising 33,000 pounds one foot in one\r\nminute every minute for an hour or a day. Some horses are natural-born\r\nslackers with sufficient acumen to beat the umpire at his own game. Some\r\nhorses walk faster than others, also horses vary in size and capacity\r\nfor work. But during a busy time each horse was counted as one\r\nhorsepower, and they were only eight or ten in number. And it so\r\ndeveloped that the threshing horsepower had limitations which the\r\nseparator outgrew.\r\n\r\nThe old threshing horsepower has been superseded by steam engines and\r\ngasoline and kerosene power, but horses are more important than ever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 109.--Horse Power, showing the manner of attaching\r\nthe braced lever to the bull wheel.]\r\n\r\nFarm horses are larger and more powerful; they are better kept, better\r\ntrained, and hitched to better machinery, because it pays. One man\r\ndrives three 1,600-pound draft horses as fast as he used to drive two\r\n1,000-pound general-purpose horses. The three drafters make play of a\r\nheavy load, while the two light horses worry themselves poor and\r\naccomplish little. Modern farm machinery is heavier, it cuts wider and\r\ndigs deeper and does more thorough work. Modern farm requirements go\r\nscientifically into the proper cultivation and preparation of soil to\r\nincrease fertility. Old methods used up fertility until the land refused\r\nto produce profitably.\r\n\r\nAlthough the old familiar horsepower has been greatly outclassed, it has\r\nnot been discarded. There are many small horsepowers in use for\r\nelevating grain, baling hay, cutting straw for feed and bedding,\r\ngrinding feed and other light work where engine power is not available.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER-POWER\r\n\r\nWater-power is the most satisfactory of all kinds of stationary farm\r\npower, when a steady stream of water may be harnessed to a good\r\nwater-wheel. It is not a difficult engineering feat to throw a dam\r\nacross a small stream and take the water out into a penstock to supply\r\nwater to a turbine water-wheel. In the first place it is necessary to\r\nmeasure the flow of water to determine the size of water-wheel which may\r\nbe used to advantage. In connection with the flow of water it is also\r\nimportant to know the fall. Water is measured by what is termed a\r\n\"weir.\" It is easily made by cutting an oblong notch in a plank placed\r\nacross the stream, as a temporary dam which raises the water a few\r\ninches to get a steady, even flow of water through the notch so that\r\ncalculations may be made in miner's inches. The term \"miner's inch\" is\r\nnot accurate, but it comes near enough for practical purposes. Measuring\r\nthe volume of water should be done during a dry time in summer.\r\n\r\nThe fall of the stream is easily measured by means of a carpenter's\r\nlevel and a stake. The stake is driven into the ground at a point\r\ndownstream where water may be delivered to the wheel and a tailrace\r\nestablished to the best advantage. Sighting over the level to a mark on\r\nthe stake will show the amount of fall. When a manufacturer of\r\nwater-wheels has the amount of water and the fall, he can estimate the\r\nsize and character of wheel to supply. The penstock may be vertical or\r\nplaced on a slant. A galvanized pipe sufficient to carry the necessary\r\namount of water may be laid along the bank, but it should be thoroughly\r\nwell supported because a pipe full of water is heavy, and settling is\r\nlikely to break a joint.\r\n\r\nGalvanized piping for a farm penstock is not necessarily expensive. It\r\nmay be made at any tin shop and put together on the ground in sections.\r\nThe only difficult part about it is soldering the under side of the\r\njoints, but generally it may be rolled a little to one side until the\r\nbottom of the seam is reached.\r\n\r\nThe most satisfactory way to carry power from the water-wheel to the\r\nfarm buildings is by means of electricity. The dynamo may be coupled to\r\nthe water-wheel and wires carried any required distance.\r\n\r\nThe work of installing electric power machinery is more a question of\r\ndetail than mechanics or electrical engineering. The different\r\nappliances are bought from the manufacturer and placed where they are\r\nneeded. It is principally a question of expense and quantity of\r\nelectricity needed or developed. If the current is used for power, then\r\na motor is connected with the dynamo and current from the dynamo drives\r\nthe motor. A dynamo may be connected with the water-wheel shaft at the\r\nsource of power and the motor may be placed in the power-house or any of\r\nthe other buildings.\r\n\r\nThe cost of farm waterworks depends principally on the amount of power\r\ndeveloped. Small machinery may be had for a few hundred dollars, but\r\nlarge, powerful machinery is expensive. If the stream is large and\r\nconsiderable power is going to waste it might pay to put in a larger\r\nplant and sell current to the neighbors for electric lighting and for\r\npower purposes. Standard machinery is manufactured for just such plants.\r\n\r\nThe question of harnessing a stream on your own land when you control\r\nboth banks is a simple business proposition. If anyone else can set up a\r\nplausible plea of riparian rights, flood damage, interstate\r\ncomplications or interference with navigation, it then becomes a\r\nquestion of litigation to be decided by some succeeding generation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEAM BOILER AND ENGINE\r\n\r\nFarm engines usually are of two different types, steam engines and\r\ngasoline or oil engines. Steam stationary engines are used on dairy\r\nfarms because steam is the best known means of keeping a dairy clean and\r\nsanitary. The boiler that furnishes power to run the engine also\r\nsupplies steam to heat water and steam for sterilizing bottles, cans and\r\nother utensils.\r\n\r\nFor some unaccountable reason steam engines are more reliable than\r\ngasoline engines. At the same time they require more attention, that is,\r\nthe boilers do. Steam engines have been known to perform their tasks\r\nyear after year without balking and without repairs or attention of any\r\nkind except to feed steam and oil into the necessary parts, and\r\noccasionally repack the stuffing boxes.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, boilers require superintendence to feed them with\r\nboth fuel and water. The amount of time varies greatly. If the boiler is\r\nvery much larger than the engine, that is, if the boiler is big enough\r\nto furnish steam for two such engines, it will furnish steam for one\r\nengine and only half try. This means that the fireman can raise 40 or 60\r\npounds of steam and attend to his other work around the dairy or barn.\r\n\r\nWhere steam boilers are required for heating water and furnishing steam\r\nto scald cans and wash bottles, the boiler should be several horsepower\r\nlarger than the engine requirements. There is no objection to this\r\nexcept that a large boiler costs more than a smaller one, and that more\r\nsteam is generated than is actually required to run the engine. The kind\r\nof work required of a boiler and engine must determine the size and\r\ngeneral character of the installation.\r\n\r\nPortable boilers and engines are not quite so satisfactory as\r\nstationary, but there are a great many portable outfits that give good\r\nsatisfaction, and there is the advantage of moving them to the different\r\nparts of the farm when power is required for certain purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALL GASOLINE ENGINES\r\n\r\nA gasoline engine of 2-1/2 horsepower is the most useful size for a\r\ngeneral purpose farm engine. It is convenient to run the pump,\r\nwashing-machine, fanning-mill, cream-separator, grindstone, and other\r\nsimilar farm chores that have heretofore always been done by human\r\nmuscle. A small engine may be placed on a low-down truck and moved from\r\none building to another by hand. One drive belt 20 or 30 feet long,\r\nmaking a double belt reach of 12 or 15 feet, will answer for each\r\nsetting.\r\n\r\nThe engine once lined up to hitch onto the pulley of any stationary\r\nmachine is all that is necessary. When the truck is once placed in\r\nproper position the wheels may be blocked by a casting of concrete\r\nmolded into a depression in the ground in front and behind each wheel.\r\nThese blocks are permanent so that the truck may be pulled to the same\r\nspot each time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 110.--Kerosene Farm Engine. This is a very compact\r\ntype of engine with heavy flywheels. A longer base might sit steadier on\r\na wagon, but for stationary use on a solid concrete pier it gives good\r\nservice.]\r\n\r\nA gasoline engine for farm use is expected to run by the hour without\r\nattention. For this reason it should have a good, reliable hit and miss\r\ngovernor to regulate the speed, as this type is the most economical in\r\nfuel. It should have a magneto in addition to a six-cell dry battery. It\r\nshould be equipped with an impulse starter, a device that eliminates all\r\nstarting troubles. The engine should be perfectly balanced so as to\r\ninsure smooth running, which adds materially to the life of the engine.\r\nWith a good, solid pump jack, a 2-1/2 horsepower engine will pump water\r\nuntil the tank is full, whether it requires one hour or half a day.\r\n\r\nIt is easily moved to the dairy house to run the separator. As the\r\ncream-separator chore comes along regularly every night and every\r\nmorning, the engine and truck would naturally remain inside of the dairy\r\nhouse more than any other place. If the dairy house is too small to let\r\nthe engine in, then an addition is necessary, for the engine must be\r\nkept under cover. The engine house should have some artistic pretensions\r\nand a coat of paint.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEROSENE PORTABLE ENGINES\r\n\r\nThe kerosene engine is necessarily of the throttle governor type in\r\norder to maintain approximately uniform high temperature at all times,\r\nso essential to the proper combustion of kerosene fuel. Therefore, a\r\nkerosene engine of the hit-and-miss type should be avoided. However,\r\nthere are certain classes of work where a throttle governor engine is at\r\na decided disadvantage, such as sawing wood, because a throttle governor\r\nengine will not go from light load to full load as quickly as will a\r\nhit-and-miss type, and consequently chokes down much easier, causing\r\nconsiderable loss of time.\r\n\r\nA general purpose portable kerosene engine is admirably suited to all\r\nwork requiring considerable horsepower and long hours of service with a\r\nfairly steady load, such as tractor work, threshing, custom feed\r\ngrinding, irrigating and silo filling. There will be a considerable\r\nsaving in fuel bill over a gasoline engine if the engine will really run\r\nwith kerosene, or other low-priced fuel, without being mixed with\r\ngasoline.\r\n\r\nIn choosing a kerosene engine, particular attention should be paid to\r\nwhether or not the engine can be run on all loads without smoking.\r\nUnless this can be done, liquid fuel is entering the cylinder which will\r\ncause excessive wear on the piston and rings. A good kerosene engine\r\nshould show as clean an exhaust as when operating on gasoline and\r\nshould develop approximately as much horsepower. Another feature is\r\nharmonizing the fuel oil and the lubricating oil so that one will not\r\ncounteract the effects of the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTABLE FARM ENGINE AND TRUCK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 111.--Portable Farm Engine. This engine is\r\npermanently mounted on a low wheel truck wagon. The saw frame is\r\ndetachable and the same truck is used for spraying and other work.]\r\n\r\nA convenient arrangement for truck and portable power for spraying,\r\nsawing wood and irrigation pumping, is shown in the accompanying\r\nillustration. The truck is low down, which keeps the machinery within\r\nreach. The wheels are well braced, which tends to hold the outfit steady\r\nwhen the engine is running. The saw table is detachable. When removed,\r\nthe spraying tank bolts on to the same truck frame; also the elevated\r\ntable with the railing around it, where the men stand to spray large\r\napple trees, is bolted onto the wagon bed.\r\n\r\nSpraying never was properly done until the powerful engine and high\r\npressure tanks were invented. Spraying to be effective, should be fine\r\nas mist, which requires a pressure of 150 pounds. There may be a number\r\nof attachments to a spraying outfit of this kind. A pipe suspended under\r\nthe frame with a nozzle for each row is used to spray potatoes,\r\nstrawberry vines and other low down crops that are grown in rows. When\r\nnot in use as a portable engine it is blocked firmly into place to run\r\nthe regular stationary farm machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDRAULIC RAM\r\n\r\nThe hydraulic ram is a machine that gets its power from the momentum of\r\nrunning water. A ram consists of a pipe of large diameter, an air\r\nchamber and another pipe of small diameter, all connected by means of\r\nvalves to encourage the flow of water in two different directions. A\r\nsupply of running water with a fall of at least two feet is run through\r\na pipe several inches in diameter reaching from above the dam to the\r\nhydraulic ram, where part of the flow enters the air chamber of the ram.\r\nNear the foot of the large pipe, or at what might be called the\r\ntailrace, is a peculiarly constructed valve that closes when running\r\nwater starts to pass through it. When the large valve closes the water\r\nstops suddenly, which causes a back-pressure sufficient to lift a\r\ncheck-valve to admit a certain amount of water from the large supply\r\npipe into the air-chamber of the ram.\r\n\r\nAfter the flow of water is checked, the foot-valve drops of its own\r\nweight, which again starts the flow of water through the large pipe, and\r\nthe process is repeated a thousand or a million times, each time forcing\r\na little water through the check-valve into the air chamber of the ram.\r\nThe water is continually being forced out into the small delivery pipe\r\nin a constant stream because of the steady pressure of the imprisoned\r\nair in the air-chamber which acts as a cushion. This imprisoned air\r\ncompresses after each kick and expands between kicks in a manner\r\nintended to force a more or less steady flow of water through the small\r\npipe. The air pressure is maintained by means of a small valve that\r\npermits a little air to suck in with the supply of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 112.--Hydraulic Ram. The upper drawing shows how\r\nto install the ram. The lower drawing is a detail section through the\r\ncenter of the ram. Water flows downhill through the supply pipe. The\r\nintermittent action of the valve forces a portion of the water through\r\nanother valve into the air-chamber. Air pressure forces this water out\r\nthrough delivery pipe. Another valve spills the waste water over into\r\nthe tailrace. An automatic air-valve intermittently admits air into the\r\nair-chamber.]\r\n\r\nWater may be conveyed uphill to the house by this means, sometimes to\r\nconsiderable distance. The size of the ram and its power to lift water\r\ndepends upon the amount of water at the spring and the number of feet of\r\nfall. In laying the small pipe, it should be placed well down under\r\nground to keep it cool in summer and to bury it beyond the reach of\r\nwinter frost. At the upper end where the water is delivered a storage\r\ntank with an overflow is necessary, so the water can run away when not\r\nbeing drawn for use. A constant supply through a ram demands a constant\r\ndelivery. It is necessary to guard the water intake at the dam. A fence\r\nprotection around the supply pool to keep live-stock or wild animals out\r\nis the first measure of precaution. A fine screen surrounding the upper\r\nend of the pipe that supplies water to the ram is necessary to keep\r\nsmall trash from interfering with the valves.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FARM TRACTOR\r\n\r\nFarm tractors are becoming practical. Most theories have had a try out,\r\nthe junk pile has received many failures and the fittest are about to\r\nsurvive. Now, if the manufacturers will standardize the rating and the\r\nimportant parts and improve their selling organizations the whole nation\r\nwill profit. The successful tractors usually have vertical engines with\r\nfour cylinders. They are likely to have straight spur transmission\r\ngears, and a straight spur or chain drive, all carefully protected from\r\ndust. And they will have considerable surface bearing to avoid packing\r\nthe soil. Some tractors carry their weight mostly upon the drive\r\nwheels--a principle that utilizes weight to increase traction. Other\r\ntractors exert a great deal of energy in forcing a small, narrow front\r\nsteering-wheel through the soft ground. Any farmer who has pushed a\r\nloaded wheelbarrow knows what that means. Some kerosene tractors require\r\na large percentage of gasoline. The driver may be as much to blame as\r\nthe engine. But it should be corrected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 113.--Tractor Transmission Gear. Spur gears are\r\nthe most satisfactory for heavy work.]\r\n\r\nManufacturers should do more educational work and talk less about the\r\nwonderfully marvelous and marvelously wonderful. Salesmen should study\r\nmechanics instead of oratory. Tractor efficiency should be rated\r\npractically instead of theoretically. The few actual reports of\r\nperformance have emanated from tests with new machines in the hands of\r\ntrained demonstrators. Manufacturers include belt power work among the\r\nvirtues of farm tractors, and they enumerate many light jobs, such as\r\nrunning a cream-separator, sawing wood, pumping water and turning the\r\nfanning-mill. Well, a farm tractor can do such work--yes. So can an\r\nelephant push a baby carriage. If manufacturers would devise a practical\r\nmeans of using electricity as an intermediary, and explain to farmers\r\nhow a day's energy may be stored in practical working batteries to be\r\npaid out in a week, then we could understand why we should run a 20\r\nhorsepower engine to operate a cream-separator one hour at night and\r\nanother hour in the morning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 114.--Straight Transmission Gear, forward and\r\nchain drive reverse, for traction engine.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nDRIVEN MACHINES\r\n\r\n\r\nFARM WATERWORKS\r\n\r\nEvery farm has its own water supply. Some are very simple, others are\r\nquite elaborate. It is both possible and practical for a farmer to have\r\nhis own tap water under pressure on the same plan as the city. When good\r\nwater is abundant within 75 feet of the surface of the ground the farm\r\nsupply may be had cheaper and better than the city. Even deep well\r\npumping is practical with good machinery rightly installed. Farm\r\nwaterworks should serve the house and the watering troughs under a\r\npressure of at least 40 pounds at the ground level. The system should\r\nalso include water for sprinkling the lawn and for irrigating the\r\ngarden. If strawberries or other intensive money crops are grown for\r\nmarket there should be sufficient water in the pipes to save the crop in\r\ntime of drouth. These different uses should all be credited to the farm\r\nwaterworks system pro rata, according to the amounts used by the\r\ndifferent departments of the farm. The books would then prove that the\r\nluxury of hot and cold running water in the farmhouse costs less than\r\nthe average city family pays.\r\n\r\n_Three Systems of Water Storage._--The first plan adopted for supplying\r\nwater under pressure on farms was the overhead tank. The water was\r\nlifted up into the tank by a windmill and force pump. Because wind\r\npower proved rather uncertain farmers adopted the gasoline engine,\r\nusually a two horsepower engine.\r\n\r\nThe second water storage plan was the air-tight steel water-tank to be\r\nplaced in the cellar or in a pit underground. The same pump and power\r\nsupplies the water for this system, but it also requires an air-pump to\r\nsupply pressure to force the water out of the tank.\r\n\r\nThe third plan forces the water out of the well by air pressure, as it\r\nis needed for use. No water pump is required in this system; the\r\nair-compressor takes its place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 115.--The Farm Pump. It superseded the iron-bound\r\nbucket, the slimy old bucket, the malaria-lined bucket that hung in the\r\nwell, but it wore out the women. Oil was never wasted on its creaking\r\njoints. Later it was fitted with a stuffing-box and an air-chamber, and\r\nthe plunger was hitched to the windmill.\r\n\r\nTo the right are shown two kinds of post-hole diggers. The upper digger\r\nis sometimes used to clear the fine earth out of the bottom of a hole\r\ndug by the lower digger.]\r\n\r\n_Suction-Pumps._--The word suction, when applied to pumps, is a\r\nmisnomer. The principle upon which such pumps work is this: The pump\r\npiston drives the air out of the pump cylinder which produces a vacuum.\r\nThe pressure of the atmosphere is about fifteen pounds per square inch\r\nof surface. This pressure forces sufficient water up through the\r\nso-called suction pipe to fill the vacuum in the cylinder. The water is\r\nheld in the cylinder by foot-valves or clack-valves. As the piston again\r\ndescends into the cylinder it plunges into water instead of air. A\r\nfoot-valve in the bottom end of the hollow piston opens while going down\r\nand closes to hold and lift the water as the piston rises. Water from\r\nthe well is forced by atmospheric pressure to follow the piston and the\r\npump continues to lift water so long as the joints remain air-tight. The\r\nsize of piston and length of stroke depend on the volume of water\r\nrequired, the height to which it must be lifted and the power available.\r\nA small power and a small cylinder will lift a small quantity of water\r\nto a considerable height. But increasing the volume of water requires a\r\nlarger pump and a great increase in the power to operate it. The size of\r\nthe delivery pipe has a good deal to do with the flow of water. When\r\nwater is forced through a small pipe at considerable velocity, there is\r\na good deal of friction. Often the amount of water delivered is reduced\r\nbecause the discharge pipe is too small. Doubling the diameter of a pipe\r\nincreases its capacity four times. Square turns in the discharge pipe\r\nare obstructions; either the pipe must be larger or there will be a\r\ndiminished flow of water. Some pump makers are particular to furnish\r\neasy round bends instead of the ordinary right-angled elbows. A great\r\nmany pumps are working under unnecessary handicaps, simply because\r\neither the supply pipe or discharge pipe is not in proportion to the\r\ncapacity of the pump, or the arrangement of the pipes is faulty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 116.--Hand Force-Pump. Showing two ways of\r\nattaching wooden handles to hand force-pumps.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 117.--Rotary Pump. Twin water-chamber rotary pumps\r\ntake water through the bottom and divide the supply, carrying half of\r\nthe stream around to the left and the other half to the right. The two\r\nstreams meet and are discharged at the top.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 118.--Section of Rotary Pump.]\r\n\r\n_Rotary Pumps._--A twin-chamber rotary pump admits water at the bottom\r\nof the chamber and forces it out through the top. Intermeshing cogs and\r\nrotary cams revolve outward from the center at the bottom, as shown by\r\nthe arrows in Figure 118. The stream of water is divided by the cams, as\r\nit enters the supply pipe at the bottom, and half of the water is\r\ncarried each way around the outsides of the double chamber. These\r\nstreams of water meet at the top of the chamber, where they unite to\r\nfill the discharge pipe. These pumps operate without air-chambers and\r\nsupply water in a continuous stream. They may be speeded up to throw\r\nwater under high pressure for fire fighting, but for economy in ordinary\r\nuse the speed is kept down to 200 revolutions, or thereabout. Rotary\r\npumps are also made with one single water chamber cylinder. The pump\r\nhead, or shaft, is placed a little off center. A double end cam moves\r\nthe water. Both ends of the cam fit against the bore of the cylinder. It\r\nworks loosely back and forth through a slotted opening in the pump head.\r\nAs the shaft revolves the eccentric motion of the double cam changes the\r\nsizes of the water-pockets. The pockets are largest at the intake and\r\nsmallest at the discharge. Rotary pumps are comparatively cheap, as\r\nregards first cost, but they are not economical of power. In places\r\nwhere the water-table is near the surface of the ground they will throw\r\nwater in a very satisfactory manner. But they are more used in\r\nrefineries and factories for special work, such as pumping oil and other\r\nheavy liquids.\r\n\r\n_Centrifugal Pumps._--The invention and improvement of modern\r\ncentrifugal pumps has made the lifting of water in large quantities\r\npossible. These pumps are constructed on the turbine principle. Water is\r\nlifted in a continuous stream by a turbine wheel revolving under high\r\nspeed. Water is admitted at the center and discharged at the outside of\r\nthe casing. Centrifugal pumps work best at depths ranging from twenty to\r\nsixty feet. Manufacturers claim that farmers can afford to lift\r\nirrigation water sixty feet with a centrifugal pump driven by a kerosene\r\nengine.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations show the principle upon which the pump works and the\r\nmost approved way of setting pumps and engines. Centrifugal pumps\r\nusually are set in dry wells a few feet above the water-table. While\r\nthese pumps have a certain amount of suction, it is found that short\r\nsupply pipes are much more efficient. Where water is found in abundance\r\nwithin from 15 to 30 feet of the surface, and the wells may be so\r\nconstructed that the pull-down, or the lowering of the water while\r\npumping is not excessive, then it is possible to lift water profitably\r\nto irrigate crops in the humid sections. Irrigation in such cases, in\r\nthe East, is more in the nature of insurance against drouth. Valuable\r\ncrops, such as potatoes and strawberries, may be made to yield double,\r\nor better, by supplying plenty of moisture at the critical time in crop\r\ndevelopment. It is a new proposition in eastern farming that is likely\r\nto develop in the near future.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 119.--Centrifugal Pump. This style of pump is used\r\nin many places for irrigation. It runs at high speed, which varies\r\naccording to the size of the pump. It takes water at the center and\r\ndischarges it at the outside of the casing.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 120.--Air Pressure Pump. Pumping water by air\r\npressure requires a large air container capable of resisting a pressure\r\nof 100 pounds per square inch. This illustration shows the pressure\r\ntank, engine, air-compressor, well and submerged pump.]\r\n\r\n_Air Pressure Pump._--Instead of pumping water out of the well some\r\nfarmers pump air into the well to force the water out. A double\r\ncompartment cylindrical tank is placed in the water in the well. These\r\ntanks are connected with the farm water distributing system to be\r\ncarried in pipes to the house and to the stock stables. Air under a\r\npressure of from 50 to 100 pounds per square inch is stored in a steel\r\ntank above ground. Small gas-pipes connect this air pressure tank with\r\nthe air-chamber of the air-water tank in the well. A peculiar automatic\r\nvalve regulates the air so that it enters the compartment that is\r\nfilled, or partly filled, with water, and escapes from the empty one so\r\nthe two compartments work together alternately. That is, the second\r\nchamber fills with water, while the first chamber is being drawn upon.\r\nThen the first chamber fills while the second is being emptied. This\r\nsystem will work in a well as small as eight inches in diameter, and to\r\na depth of 140 feet. It might be made to work at a greater depth, but it\r\nseems hardly practical to do so for the reason that, after allowing for\r\nfriction in the pipes, 100 pounds of air pressure is necessary to lift\r\nwater 150 feet. An air tank of considerable size is needed to provide\r\nstorage for sufficient air to operate the system without attention for\r\nseveral days. Careful engineering figures are necessary to account for\r\nthe different depths of farm wells, and the various amounts of water and\r\npower required. For instance: The air tank already contains 1,000\r\ngallons of air at atmospheric pressure--then: Forcing 1,000 gallons of\r\natmospheric air into a 1,000-gallon tank will give a working pressure of\r\n15 pounds per square inch; 2,000 gallons, 30 pounds; 3,000 gallons, 45\r\npounds, and so on. Therefore, a pressure of 100 pounds in a 1,000-gallon\r\ntank (42 inches by 14 feet) would require 6,600 gallons of free\r\natmosphere, in addition to the original 1,000 gallons, and the tank\r\nwould then contain 1,000 gallons of compressed air under a working\r\npressure of 100 pounds per square inch. A one cylinder compressor 6\r\ninches by 6 inches, operating at a speed of 200 R.P.M. would fill this\r\ntank to a working pressure of 100 pounds in about 50 minutes. One gallon\r\nof air will deliver one gallon of water at the faucet. But the air must\r\nhave the same pressure as the water, and there must be no friction.\r\nThus, one gallon of air under a working pressure of forty-five pounds,\r\nwill, theoretically, deliver one gallon of water to a height of 100\r\nfeet. But it takes three gallons of free air to make one gallon of\r\ncompressed air at forty-five pounds pressure. If the lift is 100 feet,\r\nthen 1,000 gallons of air under a pressure of forty-five pounds will\r\ntheoretically deliver 1,000 gallons of water. Practically, the air tank\r\nwould have to be loaded to a very much greater pressure to secure the\r\n1,000 gallons of water before losing the elasticity of the compressed\r\nair. If one thousand gallons of water is needed on the farm every day,\r\nthen the air pump would have to work about one hour each morning. This\r\nmay not be less expensive than pumping the water directly, but it offers\r\nthe advantage of water fresh from the well. Pure air pumped into the\r\nwell tends to keep the water from becoming stale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 121.--(1) Single-Gear Pump Jack. This type of jack\r\nis used for wells from 20 to 40 feet deep. (2) Double-Gear, or\r\nMultiple-Gear Pump Jack. This is a rather powerful jack designed for\r\ndeep wells or for elevating water into a high water-tank.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 122.--Post Pump Jack. This arrangement is used in\r\nfactories when floor space is valuable. The wide-face driving-pulley is\r\nshown to the left.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 123.--Three Jacks for Different Purposes. At the\r\nleft is a reverse motion jack having the same speed turning either right\r\nor left. The little jack in the center is for light work at high belt\r\nspeed. To the right is a powerful jack intended for slow speeds such as\r\nhoisting or elevating grain.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 124.--Speed Jack, for reducing speed between\r\nengine and tumbling rod or to increase speed between tumbling rod and\r\nthe driven machine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 125.--The Speed Jack on the left is used either to\r\nreduce or increase tumbling rod speed and to reverse the motion. The\r\nSpeed Jack on the right transfers power either from belt to tumbling rod\r\nor reverse. It transforms high belt speed to low tumbling rod speed, or\r\nvice versa.]\r\n\r\n_Pump Jacks and Speed Jacks._--Farm pumps and speed-reducing jacks are\r\npartners in farm pumping. Force-pumps should not run faster than forty\r\nstrokes per minute. Considerable power is required to move the piston\r\nwhen the water is drawn from a deep well and forced into an overhead\r\ntank. Jacks are manufactured which bolt directly to the pump, and there\r\nare pumps and jacks built together. A pump jack should have good, solid\r\ngearing to reduce the speed. Spur-gearing is the most satisfactory.\r\nBevel-gears are wasteful of power when worked under heavy loads. Power\r\nto drive a pump jack is applied to a pulley at least twelve inches in\r\ndiameter with a four-inch face when belting is used. If a rope power\r\nconveyor is used, then pulleys of larger diameters are required to\r\nconvey the same amount of power.\r\n\r\nOnly general terms may be used in describing the farm pump, because the\r\nconditions differ in each case. Generally speaking, farmers fail to\r\nappreciate the amount of power used, and they are more than likely to\r\nbuy a jack that is too light. Light machinery may do the work, but it\r\ngoes to pieces quicker, while a heavy jack with solid connections will\r\noperate the pump year in and year out without making trouble. For\r\nincreasing or reducing either speed or power some kind of jack is\r\nneeded. All farm machines have their best speed. A certain number of\r\nrevolutions per minute will accomplish more and do better work than any\r\nother speed. To apply power to advantage speed jacks have been invented\r\nto adjust the inaccuracies between driver and driven.\r\n\r\n\r\nIRRIGATION BY PUMPING\r\n\r\nThe annual rainfall in the United States varies in different parts of\r\nthe country from a few inches to a few feet. Under natural conditions\r\nsome soils get too much moisture and some too little. Irrigation is\r\nemployed to supply the deficiency and drainage, either natural or\r\nartificial, carries off the excess. Irrigation and drainage belong\r\ntogether. Irrigation fills the soil with moisture and drainage empties\r\nit. Thus, a condition is established that supplies valuable farm plants\r\nwith both air and moisture. In the drier portions of the United States,\r\nnothing of value will grow without irrigation. In the so-called humid\r\ndistricts deficiency of moisture at the critical time reduces the yield\r\nand destroys the profit. The value of irrigation has been demonstrated\r\nin the West, and the practice is working eastward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 126.--Centrifugal Pump Setting. When used for\r\nirrigation, centrifugal pumps are set as close to the ground water as\r\npractical.]\r\n\r\nIrrigation is the new handmaiden of prosperity. A rainy season is a\r\nbountiful one. Irrigation supplies the bounty without encouraging\r\ndestructive fungus diseases. Where water is abundant within easy reach,\r\npumping irrigation water is thoroughly practical. Improvements in pumps\r\nin recent years have increased their capacity and insured much greater\r\nreliability. A centrifugal pump is recommended for depths down to 75\r\nfeet; beyond this depth the necessity of installing more expensive\r\nmachinery places the business of pumping for irrigation on a different\r\nplane. A centrifugal pump will throw more water with less machinery than\r\nany other device, but like all other mechanical inventions, it has its\r\nlimitations. In figuring economical pumping, the minimum quantity should\r\nbe at least 100 gallons per minute, because time is an object, and\r\nirrigation, if done at all, should cover an area sufficient to bring\r\nsubstantial returns. Centrifugal pumps should be placed near the surface\r\nof the water in the well. For this reason, a large, dry well is dug down\r\nto the level of the water-table and the pump is solidly bolted to a\r\nconcrete foundation built on the bottom of this well. A supply pipe may\r\nbe extended any depth below the pump, but the standing water surface in\r\nthe well should reach within a few feet of the pump. The pump and supply\r\nmust be so well balanced against each other that the pull-down from\r\npumping will not lower the water-level in the well more than twenty feet\r\nbelow the pump. The nearer the ground water is to the pump the better.\r\n\r\nThe water well below the pump may be bored, or a perforated well pipe\r\nmay be driven; or several well points may be connected. The kind of well\r\nmust depend upon the condition of the earth and the nature of the water\r\nsupply. Driven wells are more successful when water is found in a\r\nstratum of coarse gravel.\r\n\r\nBefore buying irrigation machinery, it is a good plan to test the water\r\nsupply by temporary means. Any good farm pump may be hitched to a\r\ngasoline engine to determine if the water supply is lasting or not.\r\nPermanent pumping machinery should deliver the water on high ground. A\r\nmain irrigation ditch may be run across the upper end of the field. This\r\nditch should hold the water high enough so it may be tapped at\r\nconvenient places to run through the corrugations to reach the roots of\r\nthe plants to be benefited. There are different systems of irrigation\r\ndesigned to fit different soils. Corrugations are the cheapest and the\r\nmost satisfactory when soils are loose enough to permit the water to\r\nsoak into the soil sideways, as well as to sink down. The water should\r\npenetrate the soil on both sides of the corrugations for distances of\r\nseveral inches. Corrugations should be straight and true and just far\r\nenough apart so the irrigation water will soak across and meet between.\r\nSome soils will wash or gully out if the fall is too rapid. In such\r\ncases it may be necessary to terrace the land by following the natural\r\ncontour around the ridges so the water may flow gently. Where the fall\r\nis very slight, that is, where the ground is so nearly level that it\r\nslopes away less than six inches in a hundred feet, it becomes necessary\r\nto prepare the land by building checks and borders to confine the water\r\nfor a certain length of time. Then it is let out into the next check. In\r\nthe check and border system the check bank on the lower side has an\r\nopening which is closed during the soaking period with a canvas dam.\r\nWhen the canvas is lifted the water flows through and fills the next\r\ncheck. This system is more expensive, and it requires more knowledge of\r\nirrigation to get it started, and it is not likely to prove\r\nsatisfactory in the East.\r\n\r\nFor fruits and vegetables, what is known as the furrow system of\r\nirrigation is the most practical. An orchard is irrigated by plowing\r\nfurrows on each side of each row of trees. The water is turned into\r\nthese furrows and it runs across the orchard like so many little\r\nrivulets. Potatoes are irrigated on the same plan by running water\r\nthrough between the rows after the potatoes have been ridged by a double\r\nshovel-plow. This plan also works well with strawberries. After the land\r\nis prepared for irrigation, the expense of supplying water to a fruit\r\norchard, strawberry patch or potato field is very little compared with\r\nthe increase in yield. In fact, there are seasons when one irrigation\r\nwill save the crop and produce an abundant yield, when otherwise it\r\nwould have been almost a total loss.\r\n\r\n_Overhead Spray Irrigation._--The most satisfactory garden irrigation is\r\nthe overhead spray system. Posts are set ten feet apart in rows 50 feet\r\napart. Water pipes are laid on the tops of the posts and held loosely in\r\nposition by large staples. These water pipes are perforated by drilling\r\na line of small holes about three feet apart in a straight line along\r\none side of the pipe. The holes are tapped and small brass nozzles are\r\nscrewed in. The overhead pipes are connected with standpipes at the\r\nhighest place, generally at the ends of the rows. The pipe-lines are\r\nloosely coupled to the standpipes to permit them to roll partly around\r\nto direct the hundreds of spray nozzles as needed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 127.--Overhead Irrigation. Diagram showing the\r\narrangement of pipes for irrigating one acre of land. The pipes are\r\nsupported on posts six feet high.]\r\n\r\nSix feet high is sufficient to throw a fine mist or spray twenty-five\r\nfeet, which is far enough to meet the spray from the next row, so the\r\nground will be completely covered. To do this the pipes are rolled from\r\none side to the other, through a 90 degree arc to throw the spray on\r\nboth sides. The pipes usually are laid with a grade which follows down\r\nthe slope of the land. A fall of one foot in fifty is sufficient. Water\r\nis always admitted at the upper end of each pipe-line to flow down by\r\ngravity, assisted by tank pressure. A pressure of about forty pounds is\r\nneeded to produce a fine spray, and to send it across to meet the\r\nopposite jets. The little brass nozzles are drilled with about a\r\none-eighth inch hollow. But the jet opening is small, about No. 20 W. G.\r\nThis gives a wire-drawn stream that quickly vaporizes when it meets the\r\nresistance of the atmosphere. When properly installed a fine misty rain\r\nis created, which quickly takes the same temperature as the air, and\r\nsettles so gently that the most delicate plants are not injured.\r\n\r\n_Quantity of Water to Use._--Good judgment is necessary in applying\r\nwater to crops in regard to quantity, as well as the time of making\r\napplication. Generally speaking, it is better to wait until the crop\r\nreally needs moisture. When the pump is started give the crop plenty\r\nwith the expectation that one irrigation will be sufficient. Much\r\ndepends upon the amount of moisture in the soil; also the kind of crop\r\nand weather conditions enter into the problem. On sandy land that is\r\nvery dry where drainage is good, water may be permitted to run in the\r\ncorrugations for several days until the ground is thoroughly soaked.\r\nWhen potatoes are forming, or clover is putting down its big root\r\nsystem, a great deal of water is needed. Irrigation sufficient to make\r\ntwo inches of rainfall may be used to advantage for such crops under\r\nordinary farming conditions. It is necessary after each irrigation to\r\nbreak the soil crust by cultivation to prevent evaporation. This is just\r\nas important after irrigation as it is after a rain shower. Also any\r\nlittle pockets that hold water must be carefully drained out, otherwise\r\nthe crop will be injured by standing water. We are not supposed to have\r\nsuch pockets on land that has been prepared for irrigation.\r\n\r\n_Kind of Crops to Irrigate._--Wheat, oats, barley, etc., may be helped\r\nwith one irrigation from imminent failure to a wealth of production. But\r\nthese rainfall grain crops do not come under the general classification\r\nthat interests the regular irrigation farmer beyond his diversity plans\r\nfor producing considerable variety. Fruits, roots, clover, alfalfa,\r\nvegetables and Indian corn are money crops under irrigation. Certain\r\nseed crops yield splendidly when watered. An apple orchard properly\r\ncared for and irrigated just at the right time will pay from five\r\nhundred to a thousand dollars per acre. Small fruits are just as\r\nvaluable. These successes account for the high prices of irrigated land.\r\nIn the East and in the great Middle West, valuable crops are cut short\r\nor ruined by drouth when the fruit or corn is forming. It makes no\r\ndifference how much rain comes along at other times in the year, if the\r\nroots cannot find moisture at the critical time, the yield is reduced\r\noften below the profit of raising and harvesting the crop. Strawberry\r\nblossoms shrivel and die in the blooming when rain fails. Irrigation is\r\nbetter than rain for strawberries. Strawberries under irrigation may be\r\nmade to yield more bushels than potatoes under humid conditions. One\r\nhundred bushels of strawberries per acre sounds like a fairy tale, but\r\nit is possible on rich land under irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe cost of pumping for irrigation, where the well and machinery is used\r\nfor no other purpose, must be charged up to the crop. The items of\r\nexpense are interest on the first cost of the pumping machinery,\r\ndepreciation, upkeep and running expenses. On Eastern farms, however,\r\nwhere diversified farming is the business, this expense may be divided\r\namong the different lines of work. Where live-stock is kept, it is\r\nnecessary to have a good, reliable water supply for the animals. A\r\nreservoir on high ground so water may be piped to the watering troughs\r\nand to the house is a great convenience. Also the same engine that does\r\nthe pumping may be used for other work in connection with the farm, so\r\nthat the irrigation pump engine, instead of lying idle ten or eleven\r\nmonths in the year, may be utilized to advantage and made to earn its\r\nkeep. Well-water contains many impurities. For this reason, it is\r\nlikely to be valuable for crop growing purposes in a wider sense than\r\nmerely to supply moisture. Well-water contains lime, and lime is\r\nbeneficial to most soils. It has been noticed that crops grow especially\r\nwell when irrigated from wells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 128.--Power Transmission. Circular motion is\r\nconverted into reciprocating motion by the different lengths of the two\r\npitman cranks which cause the upper wheel to oscillate. Power is carried\r\nto a distance by wires. To reduce friction the wires are supported by\r\nswinging hangers. Sometimes wooden rods are used instead of wires to\r\nlessen expansion and contraction.]\r\n\r\n_House and Barns Supplied from a Reservoir._--A farm reservoir may\r\nsometimes be built very cheaply by throwing a dam across a narrow hollow\r\nbetween two hills, or ridges. On other farms, it is necessary to scrape\r\nout a hole on the highest ground within reach. For easy irrigation a\r\nreservoir is necessary, and it is economical because the pump may work\r\novertime and supply enough water so the irrigation may be done quickly\r\nand with sufficient water to make it effective. When the cost of the\r\nreservoir can be charged up to the different departments of the\r\nbusiness, such as irrigation, live-stock and house use, the cost is\r\ndivided and the profits are multiplied.\r\n\r\n_Power Conveyor._--Circular motion is converted into reciprocal motion\r\nto operate a pump at a distance from the engine. The short jack crank\r\noscillates the driving pulley to move the conveyor wires back and forth.\r\nThe distance to which power may be carried is limited by the expansion\r\nand contraction of the conveying wires. Wooden rods are better under\r\nextremes of temperature. Where an engine is used night and morning in\r\nthe dairy house to run a cream separator, this kind of power\r\ntransmission may be worked to operate the pump at the house. Light wire\r\nhangers will support the line wires or rods. They should be about three\r\nfeet in length, made fast at top and bottom to prevent wear. The spring\r\nof a No. 10 wire three feet long is sufficient to swing the length of a\r\npump stroke and the friction is practically nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY ON THE FARM\r\n\r\nElectric current in some sections may be purchased from electric\r\nrailways or city lighting plants. But the great majority of farms are\r\nbeyond the reach of high tension transmission cables. In some places\r\nthree or four farmers may club together and buy a small lighting plant\r\nto supply their own premises with both light and power. Unless an\r\nengineer is employed to run it trouble is sure to follow, because one\r\nfamily does all of the work and others share equally in the benefits.\r\nThe solution is for each farmer to install a small plant of his own.\r\nThe proposition is not so difficult as it sounds. Two-horsepower plants\r\nare manufactured for this very purpose. But there is more to it than\r\nbuying a dynamo and a few lamp bulbs. A farm electric system should\r\nsupply power to run all of the light stationary machinery about the\r\nfarm, and that means storage batteries, and the use of one or more small\r\nelectric motors. There are several ways to arrange the plant, but to\r\nsave confusion it is better to study first the storage battery plan and\r\nto start with an engine large enough to pump water and run the dynamo at\r\nthe same time. It is a good way to do two jobs at once--you store water\r\nenough in the supply tank to last twenty-four or forty-eight hours, and\r\nat the same time you store up sufficient electricity to run the\r\ncream-separator for a week. Electric power is the only power that is\r\nsteady enough to get all of the cream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 129.--Electric Power Plant. A practical farm\r\ngenerator and storage battery, making a complete farm electric plant\r\nthat will develop and store electricity for instant use in any or all of\r\nthe farm buildings.]\r\n\r\nRefrigeration is a profitable way to use electric power. There are small\r\nautomatic refrigerator machines that maintain low temperatures to\r\npreserve food products. This branch of the work may be made profitable.\r\nLaundry work on the farm was principally hand labor until the small\r\npower washers and wringers were invented. Now a small electric motor\r\ntakes the blue out of Monday, and the women wear smiles. Electric\r\nflatirons afford the greatest comfort on Tuesday. The proper heat is\r\nmaintained continually until the last piece is ironed. Cooking by\r\nelectricity is another great success. Some women buy separate cooking\r\nutensils, such as toasters, chafing dishes and coffee percolators.\r\nOthers invest in a regular electric cooking range at a cost of fifty\r\ndollars and feel that the money was well spent. It takes about 100\r\nK.W.H. per month in hot weather to cook by electricity for a family of\r\nfour. In winter, when heat is more of a luxury, the coal or wood range\r\nwill save half of the electric current. Dishwashing by electricity is\r\nanother labor-saver three times a day. Vacuum cleaners run by\r\nelectricity take the dust and microbes out of floor rugs with less hand\r\nlabor than pushing a carpet sweeper. Incubators are better heated by\r\nelectricity than any other way. Brooders come under the same class.\r\nSewing-machines were operated by electricity in sweatshops years\r\nago--because it paid. Farm women are now enjoying the same privilege.\r\n\r\nElectric lighting on the farm is the most spectacular, if not the most\r\ninteresting result of electric generation in the country. This feature\r\nof the subject was somewhat overtaxed by talkative salesmen\r\nrepresenting some of the pioneer manufacturers of electric lighting\r\nplants, but the business has steadied down. Real electric generating\r\nmachinery is being manufactured and sold on its merits in small units.\r\n\r\nNot many miles from Chicago there is an electric lighting plant on a\r\ndairy farm that is giving satisfaction. The stables are large and they\r\nare managed on the plan of milking early in the morning and again in the\r\nmiddle of the afternoon. The morning work requires a great deal of light\r\nin the different stables, more light than ordinary, because the milking\r\nis done by machinery. The milking machine air-pump is driven by\r\nelectricity generated on the farm, the power being supplied by a\r\nkerosene engine.\r\n\r\nElectricity on this farm is used in units, separate lines extending to\r\nthe different buildings. The lighting plant is operated on what is known\r\nas the 32-volt system; the rating costs less to install than some others\r\nand the maintenance is less than when a higher voltage is used. I\r\nnoticed also that there are fewer parts in connection with the plant\r\nthan in other electric light works that I have examined.\r\n\r\nTechnical knowledge of electricity and its behavior under different\r\ncircumstances is hardly necessary to a farmer, because the manufacturers\r\nhave simplified the mechanics of electric power and lighting to such an\r\nextent that it is only necessary to use ordinary precaution to run the\r\nplant to its capacity.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it is just as well to know something about generators,\r\nswitchboards and the meanings of such terms and names as volt, ampere,\r\nbattery poles, voltmeter, ammeter, rheostat, discharge switch,\r\nunderload circuit breaker, false fuse blocks, etc., because familiarity\r\nwith these names, and the parts they represent gives the person\r\nconfidence in charging the batteries. Such knowledge also supplies a\r\nreason for the one principal battery precaution, which is not to use out\r\nall of the electricity the batteries contain.\r\n\r\nThose who have electric lighting plants on the farm do not seem to feel\r\nthe cost of running the plants, because they use the engine for other\r\npurposes. Generally manufacturers figure about 1 H.P. extra to run a\r\ndynamo to supply from 25 to 50 lights. My experience with farm engines\r\nis that for ordinary farm work such as driving the cream separator,\r\nworking the pump and grinding feed, a two-horse power engine is more\r\nuseful than any other size. Farmers who conduct business in the usual\r\nway will need a three-horsepower engine if they contemplate adding an\r\nelectric lighting system to the farm equipment.\r\n\r\nAmong the advantages of an electric lighting system is the freedom from\r\ncare on the part of the women. There are no lamps to clean or broken\r\nchimneys to cut a finger, so that when the system is properly installed\r\nthe only work the women have to do is to turn the switches to throw the\r\nlights on or off as needed.\r\n\r\nThe expense in starting a farm electric light plant may be a little more\r\nthan some other installations, but it seems to be more economical in\r\nservice when figured from a farmer's standpoint, taking into\r\nconsideration the fact that he is using power for generating electricity\r\nthat under ordinary farm management goes to waste.\r\n\r\nA three-horsepower engine will do the same amount of work with the same\r\namount of gasoline that a two-horsepower engine will do. This statement\r\nmay not hold good when figured in fractions, but it will in farm\r\npractice. Also when running a pump or cream separator the engine is\r\ncapable of doing a little extra work so that the storage batteries may\r\nbe charged with very little extra expense.\r\n\r\nOn one dairy farm a five-horsepower kerosene engine is used to\r\nfurnish power for various farm purposes. The engine is belted to a\r\ndirect-current generator of the shunt-wound type. The generator is wired\r\nto an electric storage battery of 88 ampere hour capacity. The battery\r\nis composed of a number of separate cells. The cells are grouped\r\ntogether in jars. These jars contain the working parts of the batteries.\r\nAs each jar of the battery is complete in itself, any one jar may be cut\r\nout or another added without affecting the other units. The switchboard\r\nreceives current either from the battery or from the engine and\r\ngenerator direct. There are a number of switches attached to the\r\nswitchboard, which may be manipulated to turn the current in any\r\ndirection desired.\r\n\r\nSome provision should be made for the renewal of electric lamps. Old\r\nlamps give less light than new ones, and the manufacturers should meet\r\ncustomers on some kind of a fair exchange basis. Tungsten lamps are\r\ngiving good satisfaction for farm use. These lamps are economical of\r\ncurrent, which means a reduction of power to supply the same amount of\r\nlight. The Mazda lamp is another valuable addition to the list of\r\nelectric lamps.\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin _Agriculturist_ publishes a list of 104 different uses for\r\nelectricity on farms. Many of the electrical machines are used for\r\nspecial detail work in dairies where cheese or butter is made in\r\nquantity. Sugar plantations also require small units of power that\r\nwould not apply to ordinary farming. Some of the work mentioned is extra\r\nheavy, such as threshing and cutting ensilage. Other jobs sound trivial,\r\nbut they are all possible labor-savers. Here is the list:\r\n\r\n\"Oat crushers, alfalfa mills, horse groomers, horse clippers, hay\r\ncutters, clover cutters, corn shellers, ensilage cutters, corn crackers,\r\nbranding irons, currying machines, feed grinders, flailing machines,\r\nlive stock food warmers, sheep shears, threshers, grain graders, root\r\ncutters, bone grinders, hay hoists, clover hullers, rice threshers, pea\r\nand bean hullers, gas-electric harvesters, hay balers, portable motors\r\nfor running threshers, fanning-mills, grain elevators, huskers and\r\nshredders, grain drying machines, binder motors, wheat and corn\r\ngrinders, milking machines, sterilizing milk, refrigeration, churns,\r\ncream-separators, butter workers, butter cutting-printing, milk cooling\r\nand circulating pumps, milk clarifiers, cream ripeners, milk mixers,\r\nbutter tampers, milk shakers, curd grinders, pasteurizers, bottle\r\ncleaners, bottle fillers, concrete mixers, cider mills, cider presses,\r\nspraying machines, wood splitters, auto trucks, incubators, hovers,\r\ntelephones, electric bells, ice cutters, fire alarms, electric vehicles,\r\nelectro cultures, water supply, pumping, water sterilizers, fruit\r\npresses, blasting magnetos, lighting, interior telephones, vulcanizers,\r\npocket flash lights, ice breakers, grindstones, emery wheels, wood saws,\r\ndrop hammers, soldering irons, glue pots, cord wood saws, egg testers,\r\nburglar alarms, bell ringing transformers, devices for killing insects\r\nand pests, machine tools, molasses heaters, vacuum cleaners, portable\r\nlamps to attract insects, toasters, hot plates, grills, percolators,\r\nflatirons, ranges, toilette articles, water heaters, fans, egg boilers,\r\nheating pads, dishwashers, washing machines, curling irons, forge\r\nblowers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGASOLINE HOUSE LIGHTING\r\n\r\nGasoline gas for house lighting is manufactured in a small generator by\r\nevaporating gasoline into gas and mixing it with air, about 5 per cent\r\ngas and 95 per cent air. We are all familiar with the little brass\r\ngasoline torch heater that tinners and plumbers use to heat their\r\nsoldering irons. The principle is the same.\r\n\r\nThere are three systems of using gasoline gas for farmhouse lighting\r\npurposes, the hollow wire, tube system, and single lamp system.\r\n\r\nThe hollow wire system carries the liquid gasoline through the circuit\r\nin a small pipe called a hollow wire. Each lamp on the circuit takes a\r\nfew drops of gasoline as needed, converts it into gas, mixes the gas\r\nwith the proper amount of air and produces a fine brilliant light. Each\r\nlamp has its own little generator and is independent of all other lamps\r\non the line.\r\n\r\nThe tube system of gasoline gas lighting is similar in appearance, but\r\nthe tubes are larger and look more like regular gas pipes. In the tube\r\nsystem the gas is generated and mixed with air before it gets into the\r\ndistribution tube, so that lamps do not require separate generators.\r\n\r\nIn the separate lamp system each lamp is separate and independent. Each\r\nlamp has a small supply of gasoline in the base of the lamp and has a\r\ngas generator attached to the burner, which converts the gasoline into\r\ngas, mixes it with the proper amount of air and feeds it into the burner\r\nas required. Farm lanterns are manufactured that work on this principle.\r\nThey produce a brilliant light.\r\n\r\nBy investigating the different systems of gasoline gas lighting in use\r\nin village stores and country homes any farmer can select the system\r\nthat fits into his home conditions to the best advantage. In one\r\nfarmhouse the owner wanted gasoline gas street lamps on top of his big\r\nconcrete gateposts, and this was one reason why he decided to adopt\r\ngasoline gas lighting and to use the separate lamp system.\r\n\r\n\r\nACETYLENE GAS\r\n\r\nAcetylene lighting plants are intended for country use beyond the reach\r\nof city gas mains or electric cables. Carbide comes in lump form in\r\nsteel drums. It is converted into gas by a generator that is fitted with\r\nclock work to drop one or more lumps into water as gas is needed to keep\r\nup the pressure. Acetylene gas is said to be the purest of all\r\nilluminating gases. Experiments in growing delicate plants in\r\ngreenhouses lighted with acetylene seem to prove this claim to be\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nThe light also is bright, clear and powerful. The gas is explosive when\r\nmixed with air and confined, so that precautions are necessary in regard\r\nto using lanterns or matches near the generators. The expense of\r\ninstalling an acetylene plant in a farm home has prevented its general\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOOD-SAW FRAMES\r\n\r\nThere are a number of makes of saw frames for use on farms, some of\r\nwhich are very simple, while others are quite elaborate. Provision\r\nusually is made for dropping the end of the stick as it is cut.\r\nSometimes carriers are provided to elevate the blocks onto a pile.\r\nExtension frames to hold both ends of the stick give more or less\r\ntrouble, because when the stick to be sawed is crooked, it is almost\r\nimpossible to prevent binding. If a saw binds in the kerf, very often\r\nthe uniform set is pinched out of alignment, and there is some danger of\r\nbuckling the saw, so that for ordinary wood sawing it is better to have\r\nthe end of the stick project beyond the jig. If the saw is sharp and has\r\nthe right set and the right motion, it will cut the stick off quickly\r\nand run free while the end is dropping to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe quickest saw frames oscillate, being supported on legs that are\r\nhinged to the bottom of the frame. Oscillating frames work easier than\r\nsliding frames. Sliding frames are sometimes provided with rollers, but\r\nroller frames are not steady enough. For cross sawing lumber V-shaped\r\ngrooves are best. No matter what the feeding device is, it should always\r\nbe protected by a hood over the saw. The frame should fall back of its\r\nown weight, bringing the hood with it, so that the saw is always covered\r\nexcept when actually engaged with the stick. Saw-mandrels vary in\r\ndiameter and length, but in construction they are much alike. For wood\r\nsawing the shaft should be 1-3/8\" or 1-1/2\" in diameter. The shaft runs\r\nin two babbitted boxes firmly bolted to the saw frame. The frame itself\r\nshould be well made and well braced.\r\n\r\n\r\nROOT PULPER\r\n\r\nThere are root pulpers with concave knives which slice roots in such a\r\nway as to bend the slices and break them into thousands of leafy shreds.\r\nThe principle is similar to bending a number of sheets of paper so that\r\neach sheet will slide past the next one. Animals do not chew roots when\r\nfed in large solid pieces. Cattle choke trying to swallow them whole,\r\nbut they will munch shredded roots with apparent patience and evident\r\nsatisfaction. American farmers are shy on roots. They do not raise roots\r\nin quantities because it requires a good deal of hand labor, but roots\r\nmake a juicy laxative and they are valuable as an appetizer and they\r\ncarry mineral. Pulped roots are safe to feed and they offer the best\r\nmixing medium for crushed grains and other concentrated foods.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEED CRUSHER\r\n\r\nInstead of grinding grain for feeding, we have what is known as a\r\ncrusher which operates on the roller-mill principle. It breaks the\r\ngrains into flour by crushing instead of grinding. It has the advantage\r\nof doing good work quickly. Our feed grinding is done in the two-story\r\ncorncrib and granary. It is one of the odd jobs on the farm that every\r\nman likes. The grain is fed automatically into the machine by means of\r\nthe grain spouts which lead the different kinds of grain down from the\r\noverhead bins. The elevator buckets carry the crushed feed back to one\r\nof the bins or into the bagger. In either case it is not necessary to do\r\nany lifting for the sacks are carried away on a bag truck. We have no\r\nuse for a scoop shovel except as a sort of big dustpan to use with the\r\nbarn broom.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUMP PULLER\r\n\r\nPulling stumps by machinery is a quick operation compared with the old\r\ntime methods of grubbing, chopping, prying and burning that our\r\nforefathers had on their hands. Modern stump pulling machines are small\r\naffairs compared with the heavy, clumsy things that were used a few\r\nyears ago. Some of the new stump pullers are guaranteed to clear an acre\r\na day of ordinary stumpage. This, of course, must be a rough estimate,\r\nbecause stumps, like other things, vary in numbers, size and condition\r\nof soundness. Some old stumps may be removed easily while others hang to\r\nthe ground with wonderful tenacity.\r\n\r\nThere are two profits to follow the removal of stumps from a partially\r\ncleared field. The work already put on the land has in every case cost\r\nconsiderable labor to get the trees and brush out of the way. The land\r\nis partially unproductive so long as stumps remain. For this reason, it\r\nis impossible to figure on the first cost until the stumps are removed\r\nto complete the work and to put the land in condition to raise machine\r\nmade crops. When the stumps are removed, the value of the land either\r\nfor selling or for farming purposes is increased at once. Whether sold\r\nor farmed, the increasing value is maintained by cropping the land and\r\nsecuring additional revenue.\r\n\r\nThere are different ways of removing stumps, some of which are easy\r\nwhile others are difficult and expensive. One of the easiest ways is to\r\nbore a two-inch auger hole diagonally down into the stump; then fill the\r\nauger hole with coal-oil and let it remain for some weeks to soak into\r\nthe wood. Large stumps may be bored in different directions so the\r\ncoal-oil will find its way not only through the main part of the stumps\r\nbut down into the roots. This treatment requires that the stumps should\r\nbe somewhat dry. A stump that is full of sap has no room for coal-oil,\r\nbut after the sap partially dries out, then coal oil will fill the pores\r\nof the wood. After the stump is thoroughly saturated with coal-oil, it\r\nwill burn down to the ground, so that the different large roots will be\r\nseparated. Sometimes the roots will burn below plow depth, but a good\r\nheavy pair of horses with a grappling hook will remove the separated\r\nroots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 130.--The Oldest Farm Hoist. The first invention\r\nfor elevating a heavy object was a tripod made of three poles tied\r\ntogether at the top with thongs of bark or rawhide. When hunters were\r\nlucky enough to kill a bear, the tripod elevator was erected over the\r\ncarcass with the lower ends of the poles spread well apart to lower the\r\napex. The gambrel was inserted under the hamstrings and attached to the\r\ntop of the tripod. As the skinning of the animal proceeded the feet of\r\nthe tripod were moved closer together. By the time the head was cut off\r\nthe carcass would swing clear.]\r\n\r\nDynamite often is used to blow stumps to pieces, and the work is not\r\nconsidered dangerous since the invention of safety devices. In some\r\nsections of the country where firewood is valuable, dynamite has the\r\nadvantage of saving the wood. An expert with dynamite will blow a stump\r\nto pieces so thoroughly that the different parts are easily worked into\r\nstove lengths. Pitch-pine stumps have a chemical value that was not\r\nsuspected until some fellows got rich by operating a retort.\r\n\r\n\r\nFARM ELEVATING MACHINERY\r\n\r\nMany handy and a few heavy elevators are being manufactured to replace\r\nhuman muscle. The simple tripod beef gin was familiar to the early\r\nsettlers and it is still in use. When a heavy animal was killed for\r\nbutchering, the small ends of three poles were tied together to form a\r\ntripod over the carcass. The feet of the tripod were placed wide apart\r\nto raise the apex only a few feet above the animal. After the gambrel\r\nwas inserted and attached the feet of the tripod were moved gradually\r\ncloser together as the skinning proceeded, thus elevating the carcass to\r\nswing clear of the ground.\r\n\r\n_Grain Elevators._--As a farm labor-saver, machinery to elevate corn\r\ninto the two-story corncrib and grain into the upper bins is one of the\r\nnewer and more important farming inventions. With a modern two-story\r\ncorncrib having a driveway through the center, a concrete floor and a\r\npit, it is easy to dump a load of grain or ear corn by raising the front\r\nend of the wagon box without using a shovel or corn fork. After the load\r\nis dumped into the pit a boy can drive a horse around in a circle while\r\nthe buckets carry the corn or small grain and deliver it by spout into\r\nthe different corncribs or grain bins. There are several makes of\r\npowerful grain elevating machines that will do the work easily and\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nThe first requisite is a building with storage overhead, and a\r\nconvenient place to work the machinery. Some of the elevating machines\r\nare made portable and some are stationary. Some of the portable machines\r\nwill work both ways. Usually stationary elevators are placed in vertical\r\nposition. Some portable elevators may be operated either vertically or\r\non an incline. Such machines are adaptable to different situations, so\r\nthe corn may be carried up into the top story of a farm grain warehouse\r\nor the apparatus may be hauled to the railway station for chuting the\r\ngrain or ear corn into a car. It depends upon the use to be made of the\r\nmachinery whether the strictly stationary or portable elevator is\r\nrequired. To unload usually some kind of pit or incline is needed with\r\nany kind of an elevator, so the load may be dumped automatically quickly\r\nfrom the wagon box to be distributed by carrying buckets at leisure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 131.--Portable Grain Elevator Filling a Corncrib.\r\nThe same rig is taken to the railway to load box cars. The wagon is\r\nunloaded by a lifting jack. It costs from 1c to 1-1/2c per bushel to\r\nshovel corn by hand, but the greatest saving is in time.]\r\n\r\nSome elevators are arranged to take grain slowly from under the\r\ntailboard of a wagon box. The tailrod is removed and the tailboard\r\nraised half an inch or an inch, according to the capacity of the\r\nmachinery. The load pays out through the opening as the front of the\r\nwagon is gradually raised, so the last grain will discharge into the pit\r\nor elevator hopper of its own weight. Technical building knowledge and\r\nskill is required to properly connect the building and elevating\r\nmachinery so that the two will work smoothly together. There are certain\r\nfeatures about the building that must conform to the requirements and\r\npeculiarities of the elevating machinery. The grain and ear corn are\r\nboth carried up to a point from which they will travel by gravity to any\r\npart of the building. The building requires great structural strength in\r\nsome places, but the material may be very light in others. Hence, the\r\nnecessity of understanding both building and machinery in order to meet\r\nall of the necessary technical requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nWORKING THE SOIL\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF PLOWING\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 132.--Heavy Disk Plow. A strong four-horse disk\r\nimplement for breaking stumpy ground or to tear tough sod into bits\r\nbefore turning under with a moldboard.]\r\n\r\nPlowing is a mechanical operation that deals with physics, chemistry,\r\nbacteriology and entomology. The soil is the farmer's laboratory; his\r\nsoil working implements are his mechanical laboratory appliances. A high\r\norder of intelligence is required to merge one operation into the next\r\nto take full advantage of the assistance offered by nature. The object\r\nof plowing and cultivation is to improve the mechanical condition of the\r\nsoil, to retain moisture, to kill insects and to provide a suitable home\r\nfor the different kinds of soil bacteria.\r\n\r\nThere are aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, also nitrogen-gathering\r\nbacteria and nitrifying bacteria which are often loosely referred to as\r\nazotobacter species. Few of us are on intimate terms with any of them,\r\nbut some of us have had formal introductions through experiments and\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 133.--Sulky Plow. This is a popular type of riding\r\nplow. It is fitted with a rolling coulter.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MECHANICS OF PLOWING\r\n\r\n_Walking Plow._--The draft of a walking plow may be increased or\r\ndiminished by the manner of hitch. It is necessary to find the direct\r\nline of draft between the work performed and the propelling force. The\r\nclevis in the two-horse doubletree, or the three-horse evener and the\r\nadjusting clevis in the end of the plow-beam with the connecting link\r\nwill permit a limited adjustment. The exact direction that this line\r\ntakes will prove out in question. The walking plow should not have a\r\ntendency to run either in or out, neither too deep nor too shallow. For\r\nthe proper adjustment as to width and depth of furrow, the plow should\r\nfollow the line of draft in strict obedience to the pull so that it\r\nwill keep to the furrow on level ground a distance of several feet\r\nwithout guidance from the handles. In making the adjustment it is first\r\nnecessary to see that the plow itself is in good working order. All\r\ncutting edges such as share, coulter or jointer must be reasonably sharp\r\nand the land slip in condition as the makers intended.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 134.--Disk Plow. Less power is required to plow\r\nwith a disk, but it is a sort of cut and cover process. The disk digs\r\ntrenches narrow at the bottom. There are ridges between the little\r\ntrenches that are not worked.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 135.--Three-Horse and Four-Horse Eveners. This\r\nkind of evener hitches the horses closer to the load than some others\r\nand they are easier to handle than the spread out kinds. The four-horse\r\nrig requires the best horses in the middle.]\r\n\r\nAll plows should have a leather pocket on the side of the beam to carry\r\na file. A 12-inch bastard file with a good handle is the most\r\nsatisfactory implement for sharpening the cutting edges of a plow in the\r\nfields. A good deal depends on the character of the soil and its\r\ncondition of dryness, but generally speaking, it pays to do a little\r\nfiling after plowing a half mile of furrow. If the horses are doing\r\ntheir duty, a little rest at the end of the half mile is well earned.\r\nThe plowman can put in the time to advantage with the file and the next\r\nhalf mile will go along merrily in consequence. No farmer would continue\r\nto chop wood all day without whetting his axe, but, unfortunately,\r\nplowmen often work from morning till night without any attempt to keep\r\nthe cutting edges of their plows in good working order.\r\n\r\n_Riding Plow._--The riding plow in lifting and turning the furrow slice\r\ndepends a good deal on the wheels. The action of the plow is that of a\r\nwedge with the power pushing the point, the share and the moldboard\r\nbetween the furrow slices and the land side and the furrow bottom. There\r\nis the same friction between the moldboard and the furrow slice as in\r\nthe case of the walking plow, but the wheels are intended to materially\r\nreduce the pressure on the furrow bottom and against the land side. Plow\r\nwheels are intended to relieve the draft in this respect because wheels\r\nroll much easier than the plow bottom can slide with the weight of the\r\nwork on top. The track made in the bottom of the furrow with the walking\r\nplow shows plainly the heavy pressure of the furrow slice on the\r\nmoldboard by the mark of the slip. To appreciate the weight the slip\r\ncarries, an interesting experiment may be performed by loading the\r\nwalking plow with weights sufficient to make the same kind of a mark\r\nwhen the plow is not turning a furrow.\r\n\r\nOne advantage in riding plows in addition to the relief of such a load\r\nis less packing of the furrow bottom. On certain soils when the moisture\r\nis just sufficient to make the subsoil sticky, a certain portion of the\r\nfurrow bottom is cemented by plow pressure so that it becomes impervious\r\nto the passage of moisture either up or down. The track of a plow wheel\r\nis less injurious.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 136.--Three-Section, Spike-Tooth Harrow. The\r\nharrow is made straight, but the hitch is placed over to one side to\r\ngive each tooth a separate line of travel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 137.--Harrow Sled Long Enough to Hold a\r\nFour-Section Harrow.]\r\n\r\nPlow wheels should stand at the proper angle to the pressure with\r\nespecial reference to the work performed. Wheels should be adjusted with\r\nan eye single to the conditions existing in the furrow. Some wheel plows\r\napparently are especially built to run light like a wagon above ground\r\nregardless of the underground work required of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 138.--Corn Cultivator. A one-row, riding-disk\r\ncultivator. The ridges are smoothed by the spring scrapers to leave an\r\neven surface to prevent evaporation.]\r\n\r\nAxles should hang at right angles to the line of lift so accurately as\r\nto cause the wheels to wear but lightly on the ends of the hubs.\r\nMistakes in adjustment show in the necessity of keeping a supply of\r\nwashers on hand to replace the ones that quickly wear thin.\r\n\r\nIn this respect a good deal depends on the sand-bands at the ends of the\r\nhubs. Plow wheels are constantly lifting gritty earth and dropping it on\r\nthe hubs. There is only one successful way to keep sand out of the\r\njournals and that is by having the hubs, or hub ferrules, extend well\r\nbeyond the bearings. Plow wheel hub extensions should reach two inches\r\nbeyond the journal both at the large end of the hub and at the nut or\r\nlinchpin end. Some plow wheels cut so badly that farmers consider oil a\r\ndamage and they are permitted to run dry. This is not only very wasteful\r\nof expensive iron but the wheels soon wabble to such an extent that they\r\nno longer guide the plow, in which case the draft may be increased\r\nenormously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 139.--A Combination Riding and Walking Cultivator,\r\nshowing fenders attached to protect young plants the first time through.\r\nThe two bull tongues shown are for use in heavy soils or when deeper\r\ndigging is necessary.]\r\n\r\n_Scotch Plows._--When the long, narrow Scotch sod plows are exhibited at\r\nAmerican agricultural fairs they attract a good deal of attention and no\r\nsmall amount of ridicule from American farmers because of the six or\r\nseven inch furrows they are intended to turn. In this country we are in\r\ntoo much of a hurry to spend all day plowing three-fourths of an acre of\r\nground. Intensive farming is not so much of an object with us as the\r\nquantity of land put under cultivation.\r\n\r\nThose old-fashioned Scotch plows turn a furrow about two-thirds of the\r\nway over, laying the sod surface at an angle of about 45 deg. to the bottom\r\nof the furrow. The sharp comb cut by the coulter and share stands\r\nupright so that a sod field when plowed is marked in sharp ridges six or\r\nseven inches apart, according to the width of the furrow. Edges of sod\r\nshow in the bottoms of the corrugations between these little furrow\r\nridges.\r\n\r\nWhen the rains come the water is held in these grooves and it finds its\r\nway down the whole depth of the furrow slice carrying air with it and\r\nmoistening every particle of trash clear to the bottom of the furrow.\r\nSuch conditions are ideal for the work of the different forms of\r\nbacteria to break down plant fibre contained in the roots and trash and\r\nwork it into humus, which is in turn manipulated by other forms of soil\r\nbacteria to produce soil water which is the only food of growing plants.\r\n\r\n_Jointer Plows._--American plow makers also have recognized the\r\nnecessity of mixing humus with soil in the act of plowing. To facilitate\r\nthe process and at the same time turn a wide furrow, the jointer does\r\nfairly good work when soil conditions are suitable. The jointer is a\r\nlittle plow which takes the place of the coulter and is attached to the\r\nplow-beam in the same manner. The jointer turns a little furrow one inch\r\nor two inches deep and the large plow following after turns a\r\ntwelve-inch or fourteen-inch furrow slice flat over, throwing the little\r\njointer furrow in the middle of the furrow bottom in such a way that the\r\nbig furrow breaks over the smaller furrow.\r\n\r\nIf the work is well done, cracks as wide as a man's hand and from three\r\nto five inches deep are left all over the field. These cracks lead air\r\nand moisture to rot the trash below. This is a much quicker way of\r\ndoing a fairly good job of plowing. Such plows loosen the soil and\r\nfurnish the conditions required by nature; and they may be operated with\r\nmuch less skill than the old-fashioned narrow-furrowed Scotch plows.\r\n\r\nGood plowing requires first that the soil be in proper condition to\r\nplow, neither too dry nor too wet, but no man can do good plowing\r\nwithout the proper kind of plow to fit the soil he is working with.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLOWING BY TRACTOR\r\n\r\nUnder present conditions farm tractors are not intended to replace horse\r\npower entirely but to precede horses to smooth the rough places that\r\nhorses may follow with the lighter machines to add the finishing\r\ntouches. Light tractors are being made, and they are growing in\r\npopularity, but the real business of the farm tractor is to do the heavy\r\nlugging--the work that kills horses and delays seeding until the growing\r\nseason has passed. The actual power best suited to the individual farm\r\ncan only be determined by the nature of the land and the kind of\r\nfarming.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle West where diversified farming is practiced, the 8-16 and\r\nthe 10-20 sizes seem to be the most satisfactory, and this is without\r\nregard to the size of the farm. The preponderance of heavy work will\r\nnaturally dictate the buying of a tractor heavier than a 10-20. The\r\namount of stationary work is a factor. In certain communities heavy farm\r\ntractors are made to earn dividends by running threshing machines after\r\nharvest, silo fillers in the fall and limestone crushers in the winter.\r\n\r\nHere is a classified list of jobs the medium size farm tractor is good\r\nfor:\r\n\r\nClearing the Land--pulling up bushes by the roots, tearing out hedges,\r\npulling stumps, grubbing, pulling stones.\r\n\r\nPreparing Seed Bed and Seeding--plowing, disking, crushing clods,\r\npulling a land plane, rolling, packing, drilling, harrowing.\r\n\r\nHarvesting--mowing, pulling grain binders, pulling potato digger.\r\n\r\nBelt Work--hay baling, corn shelling, heavy pumping for irrigation,\r\ngrinding feed, threshing, clover hulling, husking and shredding, silo\r\nfilling, stone crushing.\r\n\r\nRoad Work--grading, dragging, leveling, ditching, hauling crops.\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous--running portable sawmill, stretching wire fencing, ditch\r\ndigging, manure spreading.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, however, the most important farm tractor work is\r\npreparing the seed-bed thoroughly and quickly while the soil and weather\r\nconditions are the best. And the tractor's ability to work all day and\r\nall night at such times is one of its best qualifications.\r\n\r\nTo plow one square mile, or 640 acres, with a walking plow turning a\r\ntwelve-inch furrow, a man and team must walk 5,280 miles. The gang-plow\r\nhas always been considered a horse killer, and, when farmers discovered\r\nthat they could use oil power to save their horses, many were quick to\r\nmake the change.\r\n\r\nIt requires approximately 10 horsepower hours to turn an acre of land\r\nwith horses. At a speed of two miles, a team with one plow in ten hours\r\nwill turn two acres. To deliver the two horsepower required to do this\r\nwork, they must travel 176 feet per minute and exert a continuous pull\r\nof 375 pounds or 187.5 pounds per horse.\r\n\r\nOne horsepower equals a pull of 33,000 pounds, moved one foot per\r\nminute. Two-mile speed equals two times 5,280 or 10,560 feet per hour,\r\nor 176 feet per minute. Sixty-six thousand divided by 176 equals 375\r\nfoot pounds pull per minute. One horsepower is absorbed in 88 feet of\r\nfurrow.\r\n\r\nHorse labor costs, according to Government figures, 12-1/2 cents per\r\nhour per horse. On this basis ten hours' work will be $1.25, which is\r\nthe average daily cost of each horse. An average Illinois diversified\r\nfarm of 160 acres would be approximately as follows: Fifty acres of\r\ncorn, 30 acres of oats and wheat, 20 acres of hay, 60 acres of rough\r\nland, pasture, orchard, building and feed lots.\r\n\r\nThis average farm supports six work horses or mules and one colt.\r\nAccording to figures taken from farm work reports submitted by many\r\ndifferent corn belt farmers, the amount of horse-work necessary to do\r\nthis cropping would figure out as follows:\r\n\r\nFifty acres of corn land for plowing, disking, harrowing, planting,\r\ncultivating and harvesting would amount to a total of 1,450 horsepower\r\nhours. Thirty acres of wheat would require a total of 330 horsepower\r\nhours. Twenty acres of hay would require 110 horsepower hours. In round\r\nfigures, 1,900 horsepower hours at 12-1/2 cents would amount to $237.50.\r\n\r\nElaborate figures have been worked out theoretically to show that this\r\nwork can be done by an 8-16 farm tractor in 27-3/4 days at a cost for\r\nkerosene fuel and lubricating oil of $1.89 per day. Adding interest,\r\nrepairs and depreciation, brings this figure up to about $4.00 per day,\r\nor a total of $111.00 for the job. No account is kept of man power in\r\ncaring for either the horses or the tractor. The actual man labor on the\r\njob, however, figures 12-1/3 days less for the tractor than for horses.\r\nWe should remember that actual farm figures are used for the cost of\r\nhorse work. Such figures are not available for tractor work.\r\n\r\nThe cost of plowing with a traction engine depends upon so many factors\r\nthat it is difficult to make any definite statement. It depends upon the\r\ncondition of the ground, size of the tractor, the number of plows\r\npulled, and the amount of fuel used. An 8-16 horsepower tractor, for\r\ninstance, burning from 15 to 20 gallons of low grade kerosene per ten\r\nhour day and using one gallon of lubricating oil, costs about $1.90 per\r\nten hours work. Pulling two 14-inch plows and traveling 20 miles per\r\nday, the tractor will plow 5.6 acres at a fuel and an oil cost of about\r\n30 cents per acre. Pulling three 14-inch plows, it will turn 8.4 acres\r\nat a cost for fuel and oil of about 20 cents an acre.\r\n\r\nThe kind and condition of soil is an important factor in determining the\r\ntractor cost of plowing. Comparison between the average horse cost and\r\nthe average tractor cost suggests very interesting possibilities in\r\nfavor of tractor plowing under good management.\r\n\r\nAside from the actual cost in dollars we should also remember that no\r\nhorse gang can possibly do the quality of work that can be accomplished\r\nby an engine gang. Anxiety to spare the team has cut a big slice off the\r\nprofits of many a farmer. He has often plowed late on account of hard\r\nground, and he has many times allowed a field to remain unplowed on\r\naccount of worn-out teams. Under normal conditions, late plowing never\r\nproduces as good results as early plowing. Many a farmer has fed and\r\nharnessed by the light of the lantern, gone to the field and worked his\r\nteam hard to take advantage of the cool of the morning. With the\r\napproach of the hot hours of midday, the vicious flies sapping the\r\nvitality from his faithful team, he has eased up on the work or quit the\r\njob.\r\n\r\nIn using the tractor for plowing, there are none of these distressing\r\nconditions to be taken into consideration, nothing to think of but the\r\nquality of work done. It is possible to plow deep without thought of the\r\nadded burden. Deep plowing may or may not be advisable. But where the\r\nsoil will stand it, deep plowing at the proper time of year, and when\r\ndone with judgment, holds moisture better and provides more plant food.\r\n\r\nThe pull power required to plow different soils varies from about three\r\npounds per square inch of furrow for light sand up to twenty pounds per\r\nsquare inch of furrow for gumbo. The draft of a plow is generally\r\nfigured from clover sod, which averages about seven pounds per square\r\ninch. Suppose a plow rig has two 14-inch bottoms, and the depth to be\r\nplowed is six inches. A cross section of each plow is therefore 14 by 6\r\ninches, or 84 square inches. Twice this for two bottoms is 168 square\r\ninches. Since, in sandy soil, the pressure per square inch is three\r\npounds, therefore 168 times 3 pounds equals 504 pounds, the draft in\r\nsandy soil. 168 times 7 pounds equals 1,176 pounds, the draft in clover\r\nsod. 168 times 8 pounds equals 1,344 pounds, the draft in clay sod.\r\n\r\nThe success of crop growing depends upon the way the seed-bed is\r\nprepared. The final preparation of the seed-bed can never be thoroughly\r\nwell done unless the ground is properly plowed to begin with. It is not\r\nsufficient to root the ground over or to crowd it to one side but the\r\nplow must really turn the furrow slice in a uniform, systematic manner\r\nand lay it bottom side uppermost to receive the beneficial action of\r\nthe air, rain and sunshine.\r\n\r\nThe moldboard of a plow must be smooth in order to properly shed the\r\nearth freely to make an easy turn-over. The shape of the shear and the\r\nforward part of the moldboard is primarily that of a wedge, but the roll\r\nor upper curve of the moldboard changes according to soil texture and\r\nthe width and depth of furrow to be turned. Moldboards also differ in\r\nsize and shape, according to the kind of furrow to be turned. Sometimes\r\nin certain soils a narrow solid furrow with a comb on the upper edge is\r\npreferable. In other soils a cracked or broken furrow slice works the\r\nbest. When working our lighter soils a wide furrow turned flat over on\r\ntop of a jointer furrow breaks the ground into fragments with wide\r\ncracks or openings reaching several inches down. Between these extremes\r\nthere are many modifications made for the particular type or texture of\r\nthe soil to be plowed. We can observe the effect that a rough, or badly\r\nscratched, or poorly shaped moldboard has on any kind of soil,\r\nespecially when passing from gravelly soils to clay. In soil that\r\ncontains the right amount of moisture, when a plow scours all the time,\r\nthe top of the furrow slice always has a glazed or shiny appearance.\r\nThis shows that the soil is slipping off the moldboard easily. In places\r\nwhere the plow does not scour the ground is pushed to one side and\r\npacked or puddled on the underside instead of being lifted and turned as\r\nit should be. A field plowed with a defective moldboard will be full of\r\nthese places. Such ground cannot have the life to bring about a\r\nsatisfactory bacteria condition necessary to promote the rapid plant\r\ngrowth that proper plowing gives it.\r\n\r\nCultivated sandy soils are becoming more acid year after year. We are\r\nusing lime to correct the acidity, but the use of lime requires better\r\nplowing and better after cultivation to thoroughly mix the trash with\r\nthe earth to make soil conditions favorable to the different kinds of\r\nsoil bacteria. Unless we pay special attention to the humus content of\r\nthe soil we are likely to use lime to dissolve out plant foods that are\r\nnot needed by the present crop, and, therefore, cannot be utilized. This\r\nis what the old adage means which reads: \"Lime enricheth the father but\r\nimpoverisheth the son.\" When that was written the world had no proper\r\ntillage tools and the importance of humus was not even dreamed of.\r\n\r\nNot so many years ago farm plows were made of cast iron. Then came the\r\nsteel moldboard, which was supposed to be the acme of perfection in plow\r\nmaking. Steel would scour and turn the furrow in fluffy soils where cast\r\niron would just root along without turning the ground at all. Later the\r\nart of molding steel was studied and perfected until many grades and\r\ndegrees of hardness were produced and the shape of the moldboard passed\r\nthrough a thousand changes. The idea all the time was to make plows that\r\nwould not only scour but polish in all kinds of soil. At the same time\r\nthey must turn under all of the vegetable growth to make humus, to kill\r\nweeds and to destroy troublesome insects. Besides these requirements the\r\nsoil must be pulverized and laid loose to admit both air and moisture.\r\nThese experiments gradually led up to our present high grade plows of\r\nhardened steel and what is known as chilled steel.\r\n\r\nBesides the hardness there are different shapes designed for different\r\nsoils so that a plow to work well on one farm may need to be quite\r\ndifferent from a plow to do the best work in another neighborhood. The\r\nfurrow slice sliding over a perfect moldboard leaves the surface of the\r\nupturned ground as even as the bottom of the furrow. By using a modern\r\nplow carefully selected to fit the soil, gravel, sandy, stony or muck\r\nsoils, or silt loams that contain silica, lime, iron and aluminum oxide\r\ncan be worked with the right plow to do the best work possible if we use\r\nthe necessary care and judgment in making the selection.\r\n\r\nOne object of good plowing is to retain moisture in the soil until the\r\ngrowing crop can make good use of it.\r\n\r\nThe ease with which soils absorb, retain or lose moisture, depends\r\nmostly on their texture, humus content, physical condition, and surface\r\nslope or artificial drainage. It is to the extent that cultivation can\r\nmodify these factors that more soil water can be made available to the\r\ngrowing crop. There are loose, open soils through which water percolates\r\nas through a sieve, and there are tight, gumbo soils which swell when\r\nthe surface is moistened and become practically waterproof. Sandy soils\r\ntake in water more readily than heavier soils, hence less precaution is\r\nnecessary to prevent run-off.\r\n\r\nAmong the thousands of plows of many different makes there are plenty of\r\ngood ones. The first consideration in making a selection is a reliable\r\nhome dealer who has a good business reputation and a thorough knowledge\r\nof local soil from a mechanical standpoint. The next consideration is\r\nthe service the plow will give in proportion to the price.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISK HARROW\r\n\r\nFor preparing land to receive the seed no other implement will equal a\r\ndouble disk. These implements are made in various sizes and weights of\r\nframe. For heavy land, where it is necessary to weight the disk down, an\r\nextra heavy frame is necessary. It would probably be advisable to get\r\nthe extra strong frame for any kind of land, because even in light sand\r\nthere are times when a disk may be used to advantage to kill quackgrass\r\nor to chew up sod before plowing. In such cases it is customary to load\r\non a couple of sacks of sand in addition to the weight of the driver.\r\nWhen a disk is carrying 300 or 400 pounds besides its own weight the\r\nracking strains which pull from different directions have a tendency to\r\nwarp or twist a light frame out of shape. To keep a disk cultivator in\r\ngood working order it is necessary to go over it thoroughly before doing\r\nheavy work. Bolts must be kept tight, all braces examined occasionally,\r\nand the heavy nuts at the ends of the disk shafts watched. They\r\nsometimes loosen and give trouble. The greatest difficulty in running a\r\ndisk harrow or cultivator is to keep the boxings in good trim. Wooden\r\nboxes are provided with the implement. It is a good plan to insist on\r\nhaving a full set of eight extra boxes. These wooden boxes may be made\r\non the farm, but it sometimes is difficult to get the right kind of\r\nwood. They should be made of hard maple, bored according to size of\r\nshaft, and boiled in a good quality of linseed oil. Iron boxings have\r\nnever been satisfactory on a disk implement. Wooden ones make enough\r\ntrouble, but wood has proved better than iron. On most disk cultivators\r\nthere are oil channels leading to the boxings. These channels are large\r\nenough to carry heavy oil. The lighter grades of cylinder oil work the\r\nbest. It is difficult to cork these oil channels tight enough to keep\r\nthe sand out. Oil and sand do not work well together in a bearing. The\r\nmanufacturers of these implements could improve the oiling device by\r\nshortening the channel and building a better housing for the oil\r\nentrance. It is quite a job to take a disk apart to put in new boxings,\r\nbut, like all other repair work, the disk should be taken into the shop,\r\nthoroughly cleaned, repaired, painted and oiled in the winter time.\r\n\r\nSome double disk cultivators have tongues and some are made without.\r\nWhether the farmer wants a tongue or not depends a good deal on the\r\nland. The only advantage is that a tongue will hold the disk from\r\ncrowding onto the horses when it is running light along the farm lanes\r\nor the sides of the fields with the disks set straight. Horses have been\r\nruined by having the sharp disks run against them when going down hill.\r\nSuch accidents always are avoidable if a man realizes the danger.\r\nUnfortunately, farm implements are often used by men who do very little\r\nthinking. A spring disk scraper got twisted on a root and was thrown\r\nover the top of one of the disks so it scraped against the back of the\r\ndisk and continued to make a harsh, scraping noise until the proprietor\r\nwent to see what was wrong. The man driving the disk said he thought\r\nsomething must be the matter with the cultivator, but he couldn't tell\r\nfor the life of him what it was. When farmers are up against such\r\ndifficulties it is safer to buy a disk with a tongue.\r\n\r\n_Harrow Cart._--A small two-wheel cart with a spring seat overshadowed\r\nwith a big umbrella is sometimes called a \"dude sulky.\" Many sensitive\r\nfarmers trudge along in the soft ground and dust behind their harrows\r\nafraid of such old fogy ridicule. The hardest and most tiresome and\r\ndisagreeable job at seeding time is following a harrow on foot. Riding a\r\nharrow cart in the field is conserving energy that may be applied to\r\nbetter purposes after the day's work in the field is finished.\r\n\r\n\r\nKNIFE-EDGE PULVERIZERS\r\n\r\nA knife-edge weeder makes the best dust mulch pulverizer for orchard\r\nwork or when preparing a seed-bed for grain. These implements are sold\r\nunder different names. It requires a stretch of imagination to attach\r\nthe word \"harrow\" to these knife-edge weeders. There is a central bar\r\nwhich is usually a hardwood plank. The knives are bolted to the\r\nunderside of the plank and sloped backward and outward from the center\r\nto the right and left, so that the knife-edges stand at an angle of\r\nabout 45 deg. to the line of draught. This angle is just about sufficient to\r\nlet tough weeds slip off the edges instead of dragging along. If the\r\nknives are sharp, they will cut tender weeds, but the tough ones must be\r\ndisposed of to prevent choking. The proper use of the knife-edge weeder\r\nprevents weeds from growing, but in farm practice, sometimes rainy\r\nweather prevents the use of such a tool until the weeds are well\r\nestablished. As a moisture retainer, these knife-edge weeders are\r\nsuperior to almost any other implement. They are made in widths of from\r\neight to twenty feet. The wide ones are jointed in the middle to fit\r\nuneven ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOD CRUSHER\r\n\r\nThe farm land drag, float, or clod crusher is useful under certain\r\nconditions on low spots that do not drain properly. Such land must be\r\nplowed when the main portion of the field is in proper condition, and\r\nthe result often is that the low spots are so wet that the ground packs\r\ninto lumps that an ordinary harrow will not break to pieces. Such lumps\r\nroll out between the harrow teeth and remain on top of the ground to\r\ninterfere with cultivation. The clod crusher then rides over the lumps\r\nand grinds them into powder. Unfortunately, clod crushers often are\r\ndepended on to remedy faulty work on ordinary land that should receive\r\nbetter treatment. Many times the clod crusher is a poor remedy for poor\r\ntillage on naturally good land that lacks humus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 140.--Land Float. Clod crushers and land floats\r\nbelong to the same tribe. Theoretically they are all outlaws, but some\r\npractical farmers harbor one or more of them. Wet land, containing\r\nconsiderable clay, sometimes forms into lumps which should be crushed.]\r\n\r\nAs ordinarily made, the land float or clod crusher consists of from five\r\nto eight planks, two inches thick and ten or twelve inches wide, spiked\r\ntogether in sawtooth position, the edges of the planks being lapped over\r\neach other like clapboards in house siding. The planks are held in place\r\nwith spikes driven through into the crosspieces.\r\n\r\n\r\nFARM ROLLER\r\n\r\nFarm rollers are used to firm the soil. Sometimes a seed-bed is worked\r\nup so thoroughly that the ground is made too loose so the soil is too\r\nopen and porous. Seeds to germinate require that the soil grains shall\r\nfit up closely against them. Good soil is impregnated with soil\r\nmoisture, or film moisture as it is often called, because the moisture\r\nforms in a film around each little soil grain. In properly prepared\r\nsoil this film moisture comes in contact with the freshly sown seed. If\r\nthe temperature is right the seed swells and germination starts. The\r\nswelling of the seed brings it in contact with more film moisture\r\nattached to other grains of soil so the rootlet grows and pushes out\r\ninto the soil in search of moisture on its own account. A roller is\r\nvaluable to press the particles of soil together to bring the freshly\r\nsown seeds in direct contact with as many particles of soil as possible.\r\nRolling land is a peculiar operation, the value of which is not always\r\nunderstood. The original idea was to benefit the soil by breaking the\r\nlumps. It may be of some benefit on certain soils for this purpose, but\r\nthe land should always be harrowed after rolling to form a dust mulch to\r\nprevent the evaporation of moisture. Land that has been rolled and left\r\novernight shows damp the next morning, which is sufficient proof that\r\nmoisture is coming to the surface and is being dissipated into the\r\natmosphere. In the so-called humid sections of the country the great\r\nproblem is to retain moisture. Any farm implement that has a tendency to\r\ndissipate soil moisture is a damage to the farmer. Probably nine times\r\nout of ten a farm roller is a damage to the crop it is intended to\r\nbenefit because of the manner in which it is used. It is the abuse, not\r\nthe proper use of a roller, that injures the crop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 141.--Iron Land Roller Made of Boiler Plate.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 142.--Wooden Land Roller.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCORN-PLANTER\r\n\r\nCorn-planters are designed to plant two rows at once. The width of rows\r\nmay be adjusted from about 32 to 44 inches apart. When seed-corn is\r\ncarefully graded to size the dropping mechanism will feed out the grains\r\nof corn regularly with very few skips. This is one reason why most\r\nfarmers plant corn in drills. There are other cultural reasons which do\r\nnot properly belong to this mechanical article. Hill dropping is\r\nconsiderably more complicated and difficult. After the feeding mechanism\r\nhas been adjusted to the size of seed kernels to be planted so it will\r\ndrop four kernels in a hill then the trip chain is tried out to see if\r\nit is right at every joint. Dropping in hills is a very careful\r\nmechanical proposition. An inch or two out of line either way means a\r\nloss of corn in cultivating.\r\n\r\nIn setting the stakes to go and come by, a careful measurement of the\r\nfield is necessary in order to get the stake lines on both sides of the\r\nfield parallel. If the ring stakes are driven accurately on the line,\r\nthen the first hill of corn must come at the same distance from the line\r\nin each row. Likewise in starting back from the far side of the field\r\nthe first hill should measure exactly the same distance from the stake\r\nline as the first hills on the opposite side of the field. This is\r\neasily managed by counting the number of trips between the stake line\r\nand the first row of corn hills. If the two lines of stakes on the\r\nopposite sides of the field are exactly parallel it is not necessary to\r\nmove either line in order to get the proper distance to start dropping,\r\nbut it must be adjusted by measurement, otherwise the corn hills will be\r\ndodged. If the corn hills are to space three feet apart then the first\r\nrow of hills should come nine or twelve feet from the stake line. Stakes\r\nmay be measured and set a certain number of inches from the line to make\r\nthe distance come right. This careful adjustment brings the hills in\r\nline in the rows.\r\n\r\nWhen the field is level or gently sloping there is no difficulty in\r\nmaking straight rows so far as check rowing is concerned. When the field\r\nis hilly another problem crops up. It is almost impossible to run corn\r\nrows along the side of a hill and keep them straight. The planter has a\r\ntendency to slide downhill. Also the distance across a field is greater\r\nwhere the rows pass over a hill. To keep the rows straight under such\r\nconditions allowance must be made for the stretch over the hill as well\r\nas for the side thrust of the planter. Where a chain marker is used it\r\nhangs downhill and a further allowance must be made for that. A good\r\ndriver will skip an inch or so above the mark so that the rows will be\r\nplanted fairly straight. This means a good deal more in check rowing\r\nthan when the corn is planted in drills. The greatest objection to hill\r\nplanting is the crowding of four corn plants into a space that should be\r\noccupied by one plant.\r\n\r\nA great many experiments have been tried to scatter the seeds in the\r\nhill, so far without definite results, except when considerable\r\nadditional expense is incurred. However, a cone suspended below the end\r\nof the dropping tube usually will scatter the seeds so that no two seeds\r\nwill touch each other. They may not drop and scatter four or five inches\r\napart, but these little cones will help a good deal. They must be\r\naccurately adjusted so the point of the cone will center in the middle\r\nof the vertical delivery tube, and there must be plenty of room all\r\naround the cone so the corn seed kernels won't stick. The braces that\r\nhold the cones in place for the same reason must be turned edge up and\r\nsupported in such a way as to leave plenty of clearance. The idea is\r\nthat four kernels of corn drop together. They strike the cone and are\r\nscattered in different directions. They naturally fly to the outsides of\r\nthe drill mark which scatters them as wide apart as the width of the\r\nshoe that opens the drill. The advantage of scattering seed grains in\r\nthe hill has been shown by accurate experiments conducted at different\r\ntimes by agricultural colleges.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAIN DRILL\r\n\r\nTo know exactly how much seed the grain drill is using it is necessary\r\nto know how many acres are contained in the field. Most drills have an\r\nattachment that is supposed to measure how many acres and fractions of\r\nacres the drill covers. Farmers know how much grain each sack contains,\r\nso they can estimate as they go along, provided the drill register is\r\ncorrect. It is better to provide a check on the drill indicator. Have\r\nthe field measured, then drive stakes along one side, indicating one\r\nacre, five acres and ten acres. When the one-acre stake is reached the\r\noperator can estimate very closely whether the drill is using more or\r\nless seed than the indicator registers. When the five-acre stake is\r\nreached another proof is available, and so on across the field. Next in\r\nimportance to the proper working of the drill is straight rows. The only\r\nway to avoid gaps is to drive straight. The only way to drive straight\r\nis to sight over the wheel that follows the last drill mark. Farmers\r\nsometimes like to ride on the grain drill, which places the wheel\r\nsighting proposition out of the question. A harrow cart may be hitched\r\nbehind the wheel of the grain drill, but it gives a side draft. The only\r\nway to have straight rows and thorough work is to walk behind the end of\r\nthe drill. This is the proper way to use a drill, anyway, because a\r\ntooth may clog up any minute. Unless the operator is walking behind the\r\ndrill he is not in position to see quickly whether every tooth is\r\nworking properly or not. It is hard work to follow a drill all day long,\r\nbut it pays at harvest time. It costs just as much to raise a crop of\r\ngrain that only covers part of the ground, and it seems too bad to miss\r\nthe highest possible percentage to save a little hard work at planting\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL CROP MACHINERY\r\n\r\nSpecial crops require special implements. After they are provided, the\r\nequipment must be kept busy in order to make it pay. If a farmer\r\nproduces five acres of potatoes he needs a potato cutter, a planter, a\r\nriding cultivator, a sprayer that works under high pressure, a digger\r\nand a sorter. The same outfit will answer for forty acres, which would\r\nreduce the per acre cost considerably. No farmer can afford to grow five\r\nacres of potatoes without the necessary machinery, because hand labor is\r\nout of the question for work of that kind.\r\n\r\nOn the right kind of soil, and within reach of the right market,\r\npotatoes are money-makers. But they must be grown every year because the\r\nprice of potatoes fluctuates more than any other farm crop. Under the\r\nright conditions potatoes grown for five years with proper care and good\r\nmanagement are sure to make money. One year out of five will break even,\r\ntwo years will make a little money and the other two years will make big\r\nmoney. At the end of five years, with good business management, the\r\npotato machinery will be all paid for, and there will be a substantial\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEEL HOE\r\n\r\nIn growing onions and other truck crops, where the rows are too close\r\ntogether for horse cultivation, the wheel hoe is valuable. In fact, it\r\nis almost indispensable when such crops are grown extensively. The best\r\nwheel hoes have a number of attachments. When the seed-bed has been\r\ncarefully prepared, and the soil is fine and loose, the wheel hoe may be\r\nused as soon as the young plants show above ground. Men who are\r\naccustomed to operating a wheel hoe become expert. They can work almost\r\nas close to the growing plants with an implement of this kind as they\r\ncan with an ordinary hand hoe. The wheel hoe, or hand cultivator, works\r\nthe ground on both sides of the row at once, and it does it quickly, so\r\nthat very little hand weeding is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nHANDLING THE HAY CROP\r\n\r\n\r\nREVOLVING HAYRAKE\r\n\r\nAbout the first contrivance for raking hay by horse power consisted of a\r\nstick eight or ten feet long with double-end teeth running through it,\r\nand pointing in two directions. These rakes were improved from time to\r\ntime, until they reached perfection for this kind of tool. They have\r\nsince been superseded by spring-tooth horse rakes, except for certain\r\npurposes. For pulling field peas, and some kinds of beans, the old style\r\nrevolving horse rake is still in use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 143.--Grass Hook, for working around borders where\r\nthe lawn-mower is too clumsy.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 144.--Revolving Hayrake. The center piece is 4\" x\r\n6\" x 12' long. The teeth are double enders 1-3/8\" square and 4' 6\" long,\r\nwhich allows 24\" of rake tooth clear of the center timber. Every stick\r\nin the rake is carefully selected. It is drawn by one horse. If the\r\ncenter teeth stick into the ground either the horse must stop instantly,\r\nor the rake must flop over, or there will be a repair job. This\r\ninvention has never been improved upon for pulling Canada peas.]\r\n\r\nImproved revolving horse rakes have a center timber of hardwood about 4\r\nx 6 inches in diameter. The corners are rounded to facilitate sliding\r\nover the ground. A rake twelve feet long will have about eighteen\r\ndouble-end teeth. The teeth project about two and one-half feet each way\r\nfrom the center timber. Each tooth is rounded up, sled-runner fashion,\r\nat each end so it will point forward and slide along over and close to\r\nthe ground without catching fast. There is an iron pull rod, or long\r\nhook, attached to each end of the center bar by means of a bolt that\r\nscrews into the center of the end of the wooden center shaft, thus\r\nforming a gudgeon pin so the shaft can revolve. Two handles are fastened\r\nby band iron straps to rounded recesses or girdles cut around the center\r\nbar. These girdles are just far enough apart for a man to walk between\r\nand to operate the handles. Wooden, or iron lugs, reach down from the\r\nhandles with pins projecting from their sides to engage the rake teeth.\r\nTwo pins project from the left lug and three from the right. Sometimes\r\nnotches are made in the lugs instead of pins. Notches are better; they\r\nmay be rounded up to prevent catching when the rake revolves. As the\r\nrake slides along, the driver holds the rake teeth in the proper\r\nposition by means of the handles. When sufficient load has been gathered\r\nhe engages the upper notch in the right hand lug, releases the left and\r\nraises the other sufficient to point the teeth into the ground. The pull\r\nof the horse turns the rake over and the man grasps the teeth again with\r\nthe handle lugs as before. Unless the driver is careful the teeth may\r\nstick in the ground and turn over before he is ready for it. It requires\r\na little experience to use such a rake to advantage. No better or\r\ncheaper way has ever been invented for harvesting Canada peas. The only\r\nobjections are that it shells some of the riper pods and it gathers up a\r\ncertain amount of earth with the vines which makes dusty threshing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 145.--Buck Rake. When hay is stacked in the field\r\na four-horse buck rake is the quickest way to bring the hay to the\r\nstack. The buck rake shown is 16 feet wide and the 2 x 4 teeth are 11\r\nfeet long. Two horses are hitched to each end and two drivers stand on\r\nthe ends of the buck rake to operate it. The load is pushed under the\r\nhorse fork, the horses are swung outward and the buck rake is dragged\r\nbackward.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHAY-TEDDER\r\n\r\nThe hay-tedder is an English invention, which has been adopted by\r\nfarmers in rainy sections of the United States. It is an energetic\r\nkicker that scatters the hay swaths and drops the hay loosely to dry\r\nbetween showers. Hay may be made quickly by starting the tedder an hour\r\nbehind the mowing machine.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible to cut timothy hay in the morning and put it in the\r\nmow in the afternoon, by shaking it up thoroughly once or twice with the\r\nhay-tedder. When clover is mixed with the timothy, it is necessary to\r\nleave it in the field until the next day, but the time between cutting\r\nand mowing is shortened materially by the use of the tedder.\r\n\r\nGrass cut for hay may be kicked apart in the field early during the\r\nwilting process without shattering the leaves. If left too long, then\r\nthe hay-tedder is a damage because it kicks the leaves loose from the\r\nstems and the most valuable feeding material is wasted. But it is a good\r\nimplement if rightly used. In catchy weather it often means the\r\ndifference between bright, valuable hay and black, musty stuff, that is\r\nhardly fit to feed.\r\n\r\nHay-tedders are expensive. Where two farmers neighbor together the\r\nexpense may be shared, because the tedder does its work in two or three\r\nhours' time. Careful farmers do not cut down much grass at one time. The\r\ntedder scatters two mowing swaths at once. In fact the mowing machine,\r\nhay-tedder and horserake should all fit together for team work so they\r\nwill follow each other without skips or unnecessary laps. The dividing\r\nboard of the mowing-machine marks a path for one of the horses to follow\r\nand it is difficult to keep him out of it. But two horses pulling a\r\nhay-tedder will straddle the open strip between the swaths when the\r\ntedder is twice the width of the cut.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAY SKIDS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 146.--Hay Skid. This hay skid is 8 feet wide and\r\n16 feet long. It is made of 7/8\" lumber put together with 2\" carriage\r\nbolts--plenty of them. The round boltheads are countersunk into the\r\nbottom of the skid and the nuts are drawn down tight on the cleats. It\r\nmakes a low-down, easy-pitching, hay-hauling device.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 147.--Hay Sling. It takes no longer to hoist 500\r\npounds of hay than 100 pounds if the rig is large and strong enough.\r\nFour feet wide by ten feet in length is about right for handling hay\r\nquickly. But the toggle must reach to the ends of the rack if used on a\r\nwagon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 148.--(1) Four-Tined Derrick Fork. (2) Pea Guard.\r\nAn extension guard to lift pea-vines high enough for the sickle is the\r\ncleanest way to harvest Canada peas. The old-fashioned way of pulling\r\npeas with a dull scythe has gone into oblivion. But the heavy bearing\r\nvarieties still persist in crawling on the ground. If the vines are\r\nlifted and cut clean they can be raked into windrows with a spring tooth\r\nhayrake. (3) Haystack Knife. This style of hay-cutting knife is used\r\nalmost universally on stacks and in hay-mows. There is less use for\r\nhay-knives since farmers adopted power hayforks to lift hay out of a mow\r\nas well as to put it in.]\r\n\r\nHay slips, or hay skids, are used on the old smooth fields in the\r\neastern states. They are usually made of seven-eighths-inch boards\r\ndressed preferably on one side only. They are used smooth side to the\r\nground to slip along easily. Rough side is up to better hold the hay\r\nfrom slipping. The long runner boards are held together by cross pieces\r\nmade of inch boards twelve inches wide and well nailed at each\r\nintersection with nails well clinched. Small carriage bolts are better\r\nthan nails but the heads should be countersunk into the bottom with the\r\npoints up. They should be used without washers and the ends of the\r\nbolts cut close to the sunken nuts. The front end of the skid is rounded\r\nup slightly, sled runner fashion, as much as the boards will bear, to\r\navoid digging into the sod to destroy either the grass roots or crowns\r\nof the plants. Hay usually is forked by hand from the windrows on to the\r\nskids. Sometimes hay slings are placed on the skids and the hay is\r\nforked on to the slings carefully in layers lapped over each other in\r\nsuch a way as to hoist on to the stack without spilling out at the\r\nsides. Four hundred to eight hundred pounds makes a good load for one\r\nof these skids, according to horse power and unevenness of the ground.\r\nThey save labor, as compared to wagons, because there is no pitching up.\r\nAll hoisting is supposed to be done by horse power with the aid of a hay\r\nderrick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 149.--Double Harpoon Hayfork. This is a large size\r\nfork with extra long legs. For handling long hay that hangs together\r\nwell this fork is a great success. It may be handled as quickly as a\r\nsmaller fork and it carries a heavy load.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 150.--Six-Tined Grapple Hayfork. It is balanced to\r\nhang as shown in the drawing when empty. It sinks into the hay easily\r\nand dumps quickly when the clutch is released.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN HAY DERRICKS\r\n\r\nTwo derricks for stacking hay, that are used extensively in the alfalfa\r\ndistricts of Idaho, are shown in the illustration, Figure 151. The\r\nderrick to the left is made with a square base of timbers which\r\nsupports an upright mast and a horizontal boom. The timber base is\r\nsixteen feet square, made of five sticks of timber, each piece being 8 x\r\n8 inches square by 16 feet in length. Two of the timbers rest flat on\r\nthe ground and are rounded up at the ends to facilitate moving the\r\nderrick across the stubble ground or along the road to the next\r\nhayfield. These sleigh runner timbers are notched on the upper side near\r\neach end and at the middle to receive the three cross timbers. The cross\r\ntimbers also are notched or recessed about a half inch deep to make a\r\nsort of double mortise. The timbers are bound together at the\r\nintersections by iron U-clamps that pass around both timbers and fasten\r\nthrough a flat iron plate on top of the upper timbers. These flat plates\r\nor bars have holes near the ends and the threaded ends of the U-irons\r\npass through these holes and the nuts are screwed down tight. The\r\nsleigh runner timbers are recessed diagonally across the bottom to fit\r\nthe round U-irons which are let into the bottoms of the timbers just\r\nenough to prevent scraping the earth when the derrick is being moved.\r\nThese iron U-clamp fasteners are much stronger and better than bolts\r\nthrough the timbers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 151.--Idaho Hay Derricks. Two styles of hay\r\nderricks are used to stack alfalfa hay in Idaho. The drawing to the left\r\nshows the one most in use because it is easier made and easier to move.\r\nThe derrick to the right usually is made larger and more powerful. Wire\r\ncable is generally used with both derricks because rope wears out\r\nquickly. They are similar in operation but different in construction.\r\nThe base of each is 16 feet square and the high ends of the booms reach\r\nup nearly 40 feet. A single hayfork rope, or wire cable, is used; it is\r\nabout 65 feet long. The reach is sufficient to drop the hay in the\r\ncenter of a stack 24 feet wide.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 152.--Hay Carrier Carriage. Powerful carriers are\r\npart of the new barn. The track is double and the wheels run on both\r\ntracks to stand a side pull and to start quickly and run steadily when\r\nthe clutch is released.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 153.--(1) Hayfork Hitch. A whiffletree pulley\r\ndoubles the speed of the fork. The knot in the rope gives double power\r\nto start the load. (2) Rafter Grapple, for attaching an extra pulley to\r\nany part of the barn roof.]\r\n\r\nThere are timber braces fitted across the corners which are bolted\r\nthrough the outside timbers to brace the frame against a diamond\r\ntendency when moving the derrick. There is considerable strain when\r\npassing over uneven ground. It is better to make the frame so solid that\r\nit cannot get out of square. The mast is a stick of timber 8 inches\r\nsquare and 20 or 24 feet long. This mast is securely fastened solid to\r\nthe center of the frame by having the bottom end mortised into the\r\ncenter cross timber at the middle and it is braced solid and held\r\nperpendicular to the framework by 4\" x 4\" wooden braces at the corners.\r\nThese braces are notched at the top ends to fit the corners of the mast\r\nand are beveled at the bottom ends to fit flat on top of the timbers.\r\nThey are held in place by bolts and by strap iron or band iron bands.\r\nThese bands are drilled with holes and are spiked through into the\r\ntimbers with four-inch or five-inch wire nails. Holes are drilled\r\nthrough the band iron the right size and at the proper places for the\r\nnails. The mast is made round at the top and is fitted with a heavy\r\nwelded iron ring or band to prevent splitting. The boom is usually about\r\n30 feet long. Farmers prefer a round pole when they can get it. It is\r\nattached to the top of the mast by an iron stirrup made by a blacksmith.\r\nThis stirrup is made to fit loosely half way around the boom one-third\r\nof the way up from the big end, which makes the small end of the boom\r\nproject 20 feet out from the upper end of the mast. The iron stirrup is\r\nmade heavy and strong. It has a round iron gudgeon 1-1/2\" in diameter\r\nthat reaches down into the top of the mast about 18 inches. The shoulder\r\nof the stirrup is supported by a square, flat iron plate which rests on\r\nand covers the top of the mast and has the corners turned down. It is\r\nmade large to shed water and protect the top of the mast. This plate has\r\na hole one and a half inches in diameter in the center through which the\r\nstirrup gudgeon passes as it enters the top of the mast. A farm chain,\r\nor logging chain, is fastened to the large end of the boom by passing\r\nthe chain around the boom and engaging the round hook. The grab hook end\r\nof the chain is passed around the timber below and is hooked back to\r\ngive it the right length, which doubles the part of the chain within\r\nreach of the man in charge. This double end of the chain is lengthened\r\nor shortened to elevate the outer end of the boom to fit the stack. The\r\nsmall outer end of the boom is thus raised as the stack goes up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 154.--Hay Rope Pulleys. The housing of the pulley\r\nto the left prevents the rope from running off the sheaves.]\r\n\r\nAn ordinary horse fork and tackle is used to hoist the hay. Three single\r\npulleys are attached, one to the outer end of the boom, one near the top\r\nof the mast, and the other at the bottom of the mast so that the rope\r\npasses easily and freely through the three pulleys and at the same time\r\npermits the boom to swing around as the fork goes up from the wagon rack\r\nover the stack. This swinging movement is regulated by tilting the\r\nderrick towards the stack so that the boom swings over the stack by its\r\nown weight or by the weight of the hay on the horse fork. Usually a wire\r\ntruss is rigged over the boom to stiffen it. The wire is attached to the\r\nboom at both ends and the middle of the wire is sprung up to rest on a\r\nbridge placed over the stirrup.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 155.--Gambrel Whiffletree, for use in hoisting hay\r\nto prevent entanglements. It is also handy when cultivating around\r\nfruit-trees.]\r\n\r\nFarmers like this simple form of hay derrick because it is cheaply made\r\nand it may be easily moved because it is not heavy. It is automatic and\r\nit is about as cheap as any good derrick and it is the most satisfactory\r\nfor ordinary use. The base is large enough to make it solid and steady\r\nwhen in use. Before moving the point of the boom is lowered to a level\r\nposition so that the derrick is not top-heavy. There is little danger\r\nof upsetting upon ordinary farm lands. Also the width of 16 feet will\r\npass along country roads without meeting serious obstacles. Hay slings\r\nusually are made too narrow and too short. The ordinary little hay sling\r\nis prone to tip sideways and spill the hay. It is responsible for a\r\ngreat deal of profanity. The hay derrick shown to the right is somewhat\r\ndifferent in construction, but is quite similar in action. The base is\r\nthe same but the mast turns on a gudgeon stepped into an iron socket\r\nmortised into the center timber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 156.--Cable Hay Stacker. The wire cable is\r\nsupported by the two bipods and is secured at each end by snubbing\r\nstakes. Two single-cable collars are clamped to the cable to prevent the\r\nbipods from slipping in at the top. Two double-cable clamps hold the\r\nends of the cables to form stake loops.]\r\n\r\nThe wire hoisting cable is threaded differently, as shown in the\r\ndrawing. This style of derrick is made larger, sometimes the peak\r\nreaches up 40' above the base. The extra large ones are awkward to move\r\nbut they build fine big stacks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 157.--California Hay Ricker, for putting either\r\nwild hay or alfalfa quickly in ricks. It is used in connection with\r\nhome-made buck rakes. This ricker works against the end of the rick and\r\nis backed away each time to start a new bench. The upright is made of\r\nlight poles or 2 x 4s braced as shown. It should be 28 or 30 feet high.\r\nIron stakes hold the bottom, while guy wires steady the top.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA HAY RICKER\r\n\r\nIn the West hay is often put up in long ricks instead of stacks. One of\r\nmy jobs in California was to put up 2,700 acres of wild hay in the\r\nSacramento Valley. I made four rickers and eight buck rakes similar to\r\nthe ones shown in the illustrations. Each ricker was operated by a crew\r\nof eight men. Four men drove two buck rakes. There were two on the rick,\r\none at the fork and one to drive the hoisting rig. Ten mowing machines\r\ndid most of the cutting but I hired eight more machines towards the\r\nlast, as the latest grass was getting too ripe. The crop measured more\r\nthan 2,100 tons and it was all put in ricks, stacks and barns without a\r\ndrop of rain on it. I should add that rain seldom falls in the lower\r\nSacramento Valley during the haying season in the months of May and\r\nJune. This refers to wild hay, which is made up of burr clover, wild\r\noats and volunteer wheat and barley.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa is cut from five to seven times in the hot interior valleys, so\r\nthat if a farmer is rash enough to plant alfalfa under irrigation his\r\nhaying thereafter will reach from one rainy season to the next.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nFARM CONVEYANCES\r\n\r\n\r\nSTONE-BOAT\r\n\r\nOne of the most useful and one of the least ornamental conveyances on a\r\nfarm is the stone-boat. It is a low-down handy rig for moving heavy\r\ncommodities in summer as well as in winter. No other sleigh or wagon\r\nwill equal a stone-boat for carrying plows or harrows from one field to\r\nanother. It is handy to tote bags of seed to supply the grain drill, to\r\nhaul a barrel of water, feed for the hogs, and a great many other\r\nchores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 158.--Stone-Boat. Stump logs are selected for the\r\nplanks. The bend of the planks is the natural curve of the large roots.\r\nThe sawing is done by band saw cutting from two directions.]\r\n\r\nWhen the country was new, sawmills made a business of sawing stone-boat\r\nplank. Trees for stone-boat staves were cut close to the ground and the\r\nnatural crooks of the roots were used for the noses of sleigh runners\r\nand for stone-boats. But cast-iron noses are now manufactured with\r\nrecesses to receive the ends of straight ordinary hardwood planks. These\r\ncast-iron ends are rounded up in front to make the necessary nose\r\ncrook. The front plank cross piece is bolted well towards the front ends\r\nof the runner planks. Usually there are two other hardwood plank cross\r\npieces, one near the rear end and the other about one-third of the way\r\nback from the front. Placing the cross pieces in this way gives room\r\nbetween to stand a barrel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 159.--Wheelbarrow. This factory-made wheelbarrow\r\nis the only pattern worth bothering with. It is cheap and answers the\r\npurpose better than the heavier ones with removable side wings.]\r\n\r\nThe cross pieces are bolted through from the bottom up. Round-headed\r\nbolts are used and they are countersunk, to come flush with the bottom\r\nof the sliding planks. The nuts are countersunk into the cross pieces by\r\nboring holes about one-quarter inch deep. The holes are a little larger\r\nthan the cornerwise diameter of the nuts. No washers are used, and the\r\nnuts are screwed down tight into the plank. The ends of the bolts are\r\ncut off even and filed smooth. The nuts are placed sharp corner side\r\ndown and are left nearly flush on top or even with the surface of the\r\ncross pieces. In using a stone-boat, nobody wants a projection to catch\r\nany part of the load.\r\n\r\nRegular doubletree clevises are attached to the corners of the\r\nold-fashioned stone-boat and the side chains are brought together to a\r\nring and are just about long enough to form an equilateral triangle with\r\nthe front end of the stone-boat. Cast-iron fronts usually have a\r\nprojection in the center for the clevis hitch.\r\n\r\n\r\nOXEN ON A NEW ENGLAND FARM\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting experiences on a New England farm is to get\r\nacquainted with the manner in which oxen are pressed into farm service.\r\nOne reason why oxen have never gone out of fashion in New England is the\r\nfact that they are patient enough to plow stony ground without smashing\r\nthe plow.\r\n\r\nA great deal of New England farm land has been reclaimed by removing a\r\nportion of the surface stone. In the processes of freezing and thawing\r\nand cultivation, stones from underneath keep working up to the surface\r\nso that it requires considerable skill to do the necessary plowing and\r\ncultivating. Oxen ease the plowpoint over or around a rock so it can\r\nimmediately dip in again to the full depth of the furrow. A good yoke of\r\ncattle well trained are gentle as well as strong and powerful.\r\n\r\nOxen are cheaper than horses to begin with and they are valuable for\r\nbeef when they are not needed any longer as work animals. The Holstein\r\nbreed seems to have the preference for oxen with New England farmers.\r\nThe necessary harness for a pair of cattle consists of an ox yoke with a\r\nringbolt through the center of the yoke, midway between the two oxen. A\r\nheavy iron ring about five inches in diameter, made of round iron, hangs\r\nfrom the ringbolt. There are two oxbows to hold the yoke in place on the\r\nnecks of the cattle. A logging chain with a round hook on one end and a\r\ngrab hook on the other end completes the yoking outfit.\r\n\r\nThe round hook of the chain is hitched into the ring in the plow clevis.\r\nThe chain is passed through the large iron ring in the oxbow and is\r\ndoubled back to get the right length. The grab hook is so constructed\r\nthat it fits over one link of the chain flatwise so that the next link\r\nstanding crosswise prevents it from slipping.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism of a logging chain is extremely simple, positive in action\r\nand especially well adapted to the use for which it is intended. The\r\nbest mechanical inventions often pass without notice because of their\r\nsimplicity. Farmers have used logging chains for generations with hooks\r\nmade on this plan without realizing that they were profiting by a high\r\ngrade invention that embodies superior merit.\r\n\r\nIn yoking oxen to a wagon the hitch is equally simple. The end of the\r\nwagon tongue is placed in the ring in the ox yoke, the round hook\r\nengages with a drawbolt under the hammer strap bar. The small grab hook\r\nis passed through the large yoke ring and is brought back and engaged\r\nwith a chain link at the proper distance to stretch the chain taut.\r\n\r\nThe process of yoking oxen and hitching them to a wagon is one of the\r\nmost interesting performances on a farm. The off ox works on the off\r\nside, or far side from the driver. He usually is the larger of the two\r\nand the more intelligent. The near (pronounced n-i-g-h) ox is nearest to\r\nthe driver who walks to the left. Old plows turned the furrow to the\r\nright so the driver could walk on hard ground. In this way the\r\nawkwardness and ignorance of the near ox is played against the docility\r\nand superior intelligence of the off ox. In yoking the two together the\r\nyoke is first placed on the neck of the off ox and the near ox is\r\ninvited to come under. This expression is so apt that a great many years\r\nago it became a classic in the hands of able writers to suggest\r\nsubmission or slavery termed \"coming under the yoke.\" Coming under the\r\nyoke, however, for the New England ox, in these days of abundant\r\nfeeding, is no hardship. The oxen are large and powerful and the work\r\nthey have to do is just about sufficient to give them the needed\r\nexercise to enjoy their alfalfa hay and feed of oats or corn.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAVOY\r\n\r\nOne of the first implements used by farm settlers in the timbered\r\nsections of the United States and Canada, was a three-cornered sled made\r\nfrom the fork of a tree. This rough sled, in the French speaking\r\nsettlements, was called a \"travoy.\" Whether it was of Indian or French\r\ninvention is not known; probably both Indians and French settlers used\r\ntravoys for moving logs in the woods before American history was much\r\nwritten. The legs or runners of a travoy are about five feet long. There\r\nis a bunk which extends crossways from one runner to the other, about\r\nhalf or two-thirds of the way back from the turned-up nose. This bunk is\r\nfastened to the runners by means of wooden pins and U-shaped bows fitted\r\ninto grooves cut around the upper half of the bunk near the ends. Just\r\nback of the turned up nose is another cross piece in the shape of a\r\nstout wooden pin or iron bolt that is passed through an auger hole\r\nextending through both legs from side to side of the travoy. The\r\nunderside of the crotch is hollowed out in front of the bolt to make\r\nroom to pass the logging chain through so it comes out in front under\r\nthe turned up nose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 160.--Travoy. A log-hauling sled made from the\r\nfork of a tree.]\r\n\r\nThe front of the travoy is turned up, sled runner fashion, by hewing the\r\nwood with an axe to give it the proper shape. Travoys are used to haul\r\nlogs from a thick woods to the skidways. The manner of using a travoy is\r\ninteresting. It is hauled by a yoke of cattle or a team of horses to the\r\nplace where the log lies in the woods. The round hook end of the logging\r\nchain is thrown over the butt end of the log and pulled back under the\r\nlog then around the bunk just inside of the runner and hooked fast upon\r\nitself. The travoy is then leaned over against the log, the grab hook\r\nend of the chain is brought over the log and over the travoy and\r\nstraightened out at right angles to the log. The cattle are hitched to\r\nthe end of the logging chain and started. This kind of a hitch rolls the\r\nlog over on top of the bunk on the travoy. The cattle are then\r\nunhitched. The grab hook end of the chain thus released is passed down\r\nand around under the other end of the bunk from behind. The chain is\r\nthen passed over the bolt near the nose of the travoy and pulled down\r\nthrough the opening and out in front from under the nose. The small\r\ngrab hook of the logging chain is then passed through the clevis, in the\r\ndoubletree, if horses are used, or the ring in the yoke if cattle are\r\nused, and hitched back to the proper length. A little experience is\r\nnecessary to regulate the length of the chain to give the proper pull.\r\nThe chain should be short enough so the pull lifts a little. It is\r\ngenerally conceded by woodsmen that a short hitch moves a log easier\r\nthan a long hitch. However, there is a medium. There are limitations\r\nwhich experience only can determine. A travoy is useful in dense woods\r\nwhere there is a good deal of undergrowth or where there are places so\r\nrough that bobsleighs cannot be used to advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCHPIN FARM WAGONS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 161.--Cross Reach Wagon. This wagon is coupled for\r\na trailer, but it works just as well when used with a tongue and horses\r\nas a handy farm wagon. The bunks are made rigid and parallel by means of\r\na double reach. There are two king bolts to permit both axles to turn.\r\nEither end is front.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 162.--Wagon Brake. The hounds are tilted up to\r\nshow the brake beam and the manner of attaching it. The brake lever is\r\nfastened to the forward side of the rear bolster and turns up alongside\r\nof the bolster stake. The brake rod reaches from the upper end of the\r\nlever elbow to the foot ratchet at the front end of the wagon box.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 163.--Bolster Spring.]\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the country the wheels of handy wagons about the farm\r\nare held on axle journals by means of linchpins in the old-fashioned\r\nmanner. There are iron hub-bands on both ends of the hubs which project\r\nseveral inches beyond the wood. This is the best protection against sand\r\nto prevent it from working into the wheel boxing that has ever been\r\ninvented. Sand from the felloes scatters down onto these iron bands and\r\nrolls off to the ground. There is a hole through each band on the outer\r\nends of the hubs to pass the linchpin through so that before taking off\r\na wheel to oil the journal it must first be turned so the hole comes\r\ndirectly over the linchpin. To pry out the linchpin the drawbolt is\r\nused. Old-fashioned drawbolts were made with a chisel shaped end tapered\r\nfrom both sides to a thickness of about an eighth of an inch. This thin\r\nwedge end of the drawbolt is placed under the end of the linchpin. The\r\nlower side of the hub-band forms a fulcrum to pry the pin up through the\r\nhole in the upper side of the sand-band projection. The linchpin has a\r\nhook on the outer side of the upper end so the lever is transferred to\r\nthe top of the sand-band when another pry lifts the pin clear out of the\r\nhole in the end of the axle so the wheel may be removed and grease\r\napplied to the axle. The drawbolt on a linchpin wagon usually has a\r\nhead made in the form of the jaws of a wrench. The wrench is the right\r\nsize to fit the nuts on the wagon brace irons so that the drawbolt\r\nanswers three purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 164.--Wagon Seat Spring. The metal block fits over\r\nthe top of the bolster stake.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 165.--Hollow Malleable Iron Bolster Stake to hold\r\na higher wooden stake when necessary.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSAND-BANDS\r\n\r\nMany parts of farm machinery require projecting sand-bands to protect\r\nthe journals from sand and dust. Most farms have some sandy fields or\r\nridges. Some farms are all sand or sandy loam. Even dust from clay is\r\ninjurious to machinery. There is more or less grit in the finest clay.\r\nThe most important parts of farm machinery are supposed to be protected\r\nby oil-cups containing cotton waste to strain the oil, together with\r\ncovers in the shape of metal caps. These are necessary protections and\r\nthey help, but they are not adequate for all conditions. It is not easy\r\nto keep sand out of bearings on machinery that shakes a good deal.\r\nWooden plugs gather sand and dust. When a plug is pulled the sand drops\r\ninto the oil hole. Farm machinery that is properly designed protects\r\nitself from sand and dust. In buying a machine this particular feature\r\nshould appeal to the farmers more than it does. Leather caps are a\r\nnuisance. They are a sort of patchwork to finish the job that the\r\nmanufacturer commences. A man who is provident enough to supply himself\r\nwith good working tools and is sufficiently careful to take care of\r\nthem, usually is particular about the appearance as well as the\r\nusefulness of his tools, machinery and implements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 166.--Sand Caps. Not one manufacturer in a hundred\r\nknows how to keep sand out of an axle bearing. Still it is one of the\r\nsimplest tricks in mechanics. The only protection an axle needs is long\r\nferrules that reach out three or four inches beyond the hub at both\r\nends. Old-fashioned Linchpin farm wagons were built on this principle.\r\nThe hubs held narrow rings instead of skeins, but they wore for years.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBOBSLEIGHS\r\n\r\nOn Northern farms bobsleighs are as important in the winter time as a\r\nfarm wagon in summer. There are different ways of putting bobsleighs\r\ntogether according to the use required of them. When using heavy\r\nbobsleighs for road work, farmers favor the bolster reach to connect the\r\nfront and rear sleighs. With this attachment the horses may be turned\r\naround against the rear sled. The front bolster fits into a recessed\r\nplate bolted to the bench plank of the front sleigh. This plate is a\r\ncombination of wearing plate and circle and must be kept oiled to turn\r\neasily under a heavy load. It not only facilitates turning, but it\r\nprevents the bolster from catching on the raves or on the upturned nose\r\nof the front bob when turning short.\r\n\r\nThe heavy hardwood plank reach that connects the two bolsters is put\r\nthrough a mortise through the front bolster and is fastened rigidly by\r\nan extra large king-bolt. The reach plays back and forth rather loosely\r\nthrough a similar mortise in the other bolster on the rear sleigh. The\r\nrear hounds connect with the reach by means of a link and pin. This link\r\npushes up through mortise holes in the reach and is fastened with a\r\nwooden pin or key on top of the reach. Sometimes the hounds are taken\r\naway and the reach is fastened with pins before and behind the rear\r\nbolster. This reach hitch is not recommended except for light road work.\r\nThese two ways of attaching the rear sled necessitate different ways of\r\nfastening the rear bolster to the sled. When the rear bolster is\r\nrequired to do the pulling, it is attached to the sled by double\r\neyebolts which permit the necessary rocking motion and allows the nose\r\nof the rear sled to bob up and down freely. This is an advantage when a\r\nlong box bed is used, because the bolster is made to fit the box closely\r\nand is not continually oscillating and wearing. Eye-bolts provide for\r\nthis natural movement of the sled. Light pleasure bobs are attached to\r\nthe box with eyebolts without bolster stakes. The light passenger riding\r\nseat box is bound together with iron braces and side irons so it does\r\nnot need bolsters to hold the sides together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 167.--Bobsleighs, Showing Three Kinds of Coupling.\r\nThe upper sleighs are coupled on the old-fashioned short reach plan\r\nexcept that the reach is not mortised into the roller. It is gained in a\r\nquarter of an inch and fastened by an iron strap with a plate and nuts\r\non the under side. The bobs in the center show the bolster reach,\r\nprincipally used for road work. The bottom pair are coupled by cross\r\nchains for short turning around trees and stumps in the woods.]\r\n\r\nBobsleighs for use in the woods are hitched together quite differently.\r\nThe old-fashioned reach with a staple in the rear bench of the first\r\nsled and a clevis in the end of the reach is the old-fashioned rig for\r\nrough roads in the woods. Such sleighs are fitted with bunks instead of\r\nbolsters. Bunks are usually cut from good hardwood trees, hewed out with\r\nan axe and bored for round stakes. Log bunks for easy loading do not\r\nproject beyond the raves. With this kind of a rig, a farmer can fasten\r\ntwo logging chains to the reach, carry the grab hook ends out and under\r\nand around the log and back again over the sleighs, and then hitch the\r\nhorses to the two chains and roll the log up over a couple of skids and\r\non to the bunks without doing any damage to the bobsleighs. Bobsleighs\r\nhitched together with an old-fashioned reach and provided with wide\r\nheavy raves will climb over logs, pitch down into root holes, and weave\r\ntheir way in and out among trees better than any other sled contrivance,\r\nand they turn short enough for such roads. The shortest turning rig,\r\nhowever, is the cross chain reach shown in Figure 167.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING A FARM CART\r\n\r\nA two-wheeled cart large enough to carry a barrel of cider is a great\r\nconvenience on a farm. The front wheels of a buggy are about the right\r\nsize and usually are strong enough for cart purposes. A one-inch iron\r\naxle will be stiff enough if it is reinforced at the square bends. The\r\naxle is bent down near the hubs at right angles and carried across to\r\nsupport the floor of the cart box about one foot from the ground. The\r\ndistance from the ground should be just sufficient so that when the cart\r\nis tipped back the hind end will rest on the ground with the bottom\r\nboards at an easy slant to roll a barrel or milk can into the bottom of\r\nthe box. Under the back end of the cart platform is a good stout bar of\r\nhardwood framed into the sidepieces. All of the woodwork about the cart\r\nis well braced with iron. The floor of the cart is better when made of\r\nnarrow matched hardwood flooring about seven-eighths of an inch thick\r\nfastened with bolts. It should be well supported by cross pieces\r\nunderneath. In fact the principal part of the box is the underneath part\r\nof the frame.\r\n\r\nSidepieces of the box are wide and are bolted to the vertical parts of\r\nthe axle and braced in different directions to keep the frame solid,\r\nsquare and firm. The sides of the box are permanently fastened but both\r\ntailboard and front board are held in place by cleats and rods and are\r\nremovable so that long scantling or lumber may be carried on the cart\r\nbottom. The ends of the box may be quickly put in place again when it is\r\nnecessary to use them.\r\n\r\nTo hold a cart box together, four rods are necessary, two across the\r\nfront and two behind. They are made like tailboard rods in wagon boxes.\r\nThere is always some kind of tongue or handle bar in front of the farm\r\ncart conveniently arranged for either pulling or pushing. If a breast\r\nbar is used it handles better when supported by two curved projecting\r\nshafts or pieces of bent wood, preferably the bent up extended ends of\r\nthe bedpieces. The handle bar should be about three feet from the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 168.--Farm Cart. The axle need not be heavier than\r\n7/8\". The hind axle of a light buggy works the best. It is bent down and\r\nspliced and welded under the box. The cart should be made narrow to\r\nprevent overloading. The box should be low enough to rest the back end\r\non the ground at an angle of about 35 deg. for easy loading.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLT-BREAKING SULKY\r\n\r\nA pair of shafts that look a good deal too long, an axle, two wheels and\r\na whiffletree are the principal parts of a colt-breaking sulky. The\r\nshafts are so long that a colt can kick his best without reaching\r\nanything behind. The principal danger is that he may come down with one\r\nhind leg over the shaft. It is a question with horsemen whether it is\r\nbetter to first start a colt alongside of an old, steady horse. But it\r\nis generally conceded that in no case should a colt be made fast in such\r\na way that he could kick himself loose. Different farmers have different\r\nideas in regard to training colts, but these breaking carts with extra\r\nlong shafts are very much used in some parts of the country. The shafts\r\nare heavy enough so that the colts may be tied down to make kicking\r\nimpossible. A rope or heavy strap reaching from one shaft to the other\r\nover the colt's hips will keep its hind feet pretty close to the ground.\r\nAny rig used in connection with a colt should be strong enough to\r\nwithstand any strain that the colt may decide to put upon it. If the\r\ncolt breaks something or breaks loose, it takes him a long time to\r\nforget the scare. Farm boys make these breaking carts by using wheels\r\nand hind axles of a worn-out buggy. This is well enough if the wheels\r\nare strong and shafts thoroughly bolted and braced. It is easy to make a\r\nmistake with a colt. To prevent accidents it is much better to have the\r\nharness and wagon amply strong.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 169.--Colt-Breaking Sulky. The axle and hind\r\nwheels of a light wagon, two strong straight-grained shafts about 4 feet\r\ntoo long, a whiffletree and a spring seat are the principal parts of a\r\ncolt-breaking sulky. The shafts and seat are thoroughly well bolted and\r\nclipped to the axle and braced against all possible maneuvers of the\r\ncolt. The traces are made so long that the colt cannot reach anything to\r\nkick, and he is prevented from kicking by a strap reaching from one\r\nshaft up over his hips and down to the other shaft. In this rig the colt\r\nis compelled to go ahead because he cannot turn around. The axle should\r\nbe longer than standard to prevent upsetting when the colt turns a\r\ncorner at high speed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS FARM CONVENIENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nFARM OFFICE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 170.--Perspective View of Two-Story Corn Crib. The\r\nside of the building is cut away to show the elevating machinery.]\r\n\r\nBusiness farming requires an office. Business callers feel sensitive\r\nabout talking farm or live-stock affairs before several members of the\r\nfamily. But they are quite at ease when alone with the farmer in his\r\noffice. A farm office may be small but it should contain a desk or\r\ntable, two or three chairs, book shelves for books, drawers for\r\ngovernment bulletins and a cabinet to hold glassware and chemicals for\r\nmaking soil tests and a good magnifying glass for examining seeds before\r\nplanting. A good glass is also valuable in tracing the destructive work\r\nof many kinds of insect pests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 171.--Floor Plans of Two-Story Corn Crib. The\r\nfirst floor shows the driveway with corn cribs at the sides and the\r\nsecond floor plan shows the grain bins over the center driveway, with\r\nlocation of the downspouts, stairway, etc.]\r\n\r\nThe office is the proper place for making germination tests of various\r\nfarm seeds. Seventy degrees of heat is necessary for the best results in\r\nseed testing. For this reason, as well as for comfort while working, the\r\nheating problem should receive its share of attention. Many times it so\r\nhappens that a farmer has a few minutes just before mealtime that he\r\ncould devote to office work if the room be warm enough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 172.--Economy of Round Barn. The diagrams show\r\nthat the popular 36' x 80' cow stable and the commonest size of round\r\nbarn have about the same capacity. Each barn will stable forty cows, but\r\nthe round barn has room for a silo in the center. Both barns have feed\r\noverhead in the shape of hay and straw, but the round feed room saves\r\nsteps.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 173.--Concrete Farm Scale Base and Pit.]\r\n\r\nNeatly printed letter-heads and envelopes are important. The sheets of\r\npaper should be eight and a half by eleven inches in size, pure white\r\nand of good quality. The printing should be plain black and of round\r\nmedium-sized letters that may be easily read. Fancy lettering and\r\nflourishes are out of place on business stationery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 174.--Top View of the Hay-Track Roof Extension,\r\nshowing the ridgeboard and supporting jack-rafters.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 175.--Side view showing plan for building a\r\nHayfork Hood to project from peak of a storage barn. The jack-rafters\r\nform a brace to support the end of the hay-track beam.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 176.--Slaughter House. The house should be twelve\r\nfeet wide. It may be any length to provide storage, but 12 x 12 makes a\r\ngood beef skinning floor. The windlass shaft should be ten feet above\r\nthe floor, which requires twelve-foot studding. The wheel is eight feet\r\nin diameter and the winding drum is about ten inches. The animal is\r\nkilled on the incline outside of the building and it lies limp against\r\nthe revolving door. The door catch is sprung back and the carcass rolls\r\ndown onto the concrete skinning floor.]\r\n\r\nHalftone illustration of farm animals or buildings are better used on\r\nseparate advertising sheets that may be folded in with the letters when\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 177.--Rule of Six, Eight and Ten. Diagram showing\r\nhow to stake the foundation of a farm building so the excavation can be\r\nmade clear out to the corners without undermining the stakes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 178.--Roof Truss built strong enough to support\r\nthe roof of a farm garage without center posts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 179.--Design of Roof Truss Intended to Span a Farm\r\nGarage.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 180.--Roof Pitches. Mow capacity of the different\r\nroof pitches is given above the plates in figures.]\r\n\r\nTypewriters are so common that a hand-written letter is seldom seen\r\namong business correspondence. A busy farmer is not likely to acquire\r\nmuch speed with a typewriter, but his son or daughter may. One great\r\nadvantage is the making of carbon copies. Every letter received is then\r\nfiled in a letter case in alphabetical order and a carbon copy of each\r\nanswer is pinned to it for future reference.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 181.--Double Corn Crib. Two cribs may be roofed\r\nthis way as cheaply as to roof the two cribs separately. A storeroom is\r\nprovided overhead and the bracing prevents the cribs from sagging.]\r\n\r\nThe cost of furnishing a farm office will depend upon the inclinations\r\nof the man. A cheap kitchen table may be used instead of an expensive\r\nmahogany desk. A new typewriter costs from fifty to ninety dollars, but\r\na rebuilt machine that will do good work may be obtained for twenty.\r\n\r\nA useful magnifying glass with legs may be bought for a dollar or two.\r\nOr considerable money may be invested in a high-powered microscope.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEED INDICATOR\r\n\r\nThe speed requirements of machines are given by the manufacturers. It is\r\nup to the farmer to determine the size of pulleys and the speed of\r\nintermediate shafts between his engine and the machine to be driven. A\r\nspeed indicator is held against the end of a shaft at the center. The\r\nindicator pin then revolves with the shaft and the number of revolutions\r\nper minute are counted by timing the pointer on the dial with the second\r\nhand of a watch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 182.--Speed Timers. Two styles. The point is held\r\nagainst the center of the shaft to be tested. The number of revolutions\r\nper minute is shown in figures on the face of the dial. The indicator is\r\ntimed to the second hand of a watch.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 183.--Building Bracket. Made of 2 x 4 pieces put\r\ntogether at right angles with diagonal braces. The supporting leg fits\r\nbetween the four diagonal braces.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSOIL TOOLS\r\n\r\nSoil moisture often is the limiting factor in crop raising. Soil\r\nmoisture may be measured by analysis. The first step is to obtain\r\nsamples at different depths. This is done accurately and quickly with a\r\ngood soil auger. Other paraphernalia is required to make a careful\r\nanalysis of the sample, but a farmer of experience will make a mud ball\r\nand form a very good estimate of the amount of water in it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 184.--Diagram showing how to cut a plank on a\r\nband-saw to form a curved rafter. The two pieces of the plank are spiked\r\ntogether as shown in the lower drawing. This makes a curved rafter\r\nwithout waste of material.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 185.--Breeding Crate for Hogs. The illustration\r\nshows the manner of construction.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 186.--Soil Auger. Scientific farming demands that\r\nsoils shall be tested for moisture. A long handled auger is used to\r\nbring samples of soil to the surface.

(2) Asparagus\r\nKnife.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFENCE-MAKING TOOLS\r\n\r\n_Sliding Field Gate._--Each farm field should have a gate, not\r\nnecessarily expensive, but it should be reasonably convenient. Farm\r\nfield gates should be made sixteen feet long, which will allow for a\r\nclear opening about fourteen feet wide. The cheapest way to make a good\r\nfarm gate is to use a 10-inch board for the bottom, 8-inch for the board\r\nnext to the bottom and three 6-inch boards above that. The space between\r\nthe bottom board and next board is two inches. This narrow space\r\nprevents hogs from lifting the gate with their noses. The spaces widen\r\ntoward the top, so that the gate when finished is five feet high. If\r\ncolts run the fields then a bar is needed along the top of the gate. Six\r\ncross pieces 1 inch by 6 inches are used to hold the gate together.\r\nThese cross pieces are bolted through at each intersection. Also a\r\nslanting brace is used on the front half of the gate to keep it from\r\nracking and this brace is put on with bolts. Two posts are set at each\r\nend of the gate. The front posts hold the front end of the gate between\r\nthem, and the rear posts the same. There is a cross piece which reaches\r\nfrom one of the rear posts to the other to slide the gate and hold it\r\noff the ground. A similar cross piece holds the front end of the gate up\r\nfrom the ground. Sometimes a swivel roller is attached to the rear cross\r\npiece to roll the gate if it is to be used a good deal. A plain, simple\r\nsliding gate is all that is necessary for fields some distance from the\r\nbarn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 192.--(1) Plumb-Bob and Plumb-Line. The line is\r\npaid out about 6 feet from the spool and given a half hitch. It may then\r\nbe hung over the wire and the spool will balance the bob. (2) Bipod. The\r\nlegs of a fence bipod are cut 6 feet long. The bolt is put through 6\r\ninches from the top ends. By the aid of the plummet the upper wire is\r\nstrung plumb over the barb-wire in the furrow and 4' 6\" above grade. The\r\nlower parts of the posts are set against the barb-wire and the upper\r\nfaces of the posts at the top are set even with the upper wire. This\r\nplan not only places the posts in line, both at the top and bottom, but\r\nit regulates the height.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 193.--Fence Tools. The upper tool is a round steel\r\npin to twist heavy brace wires. The scoop is for working stones out of\r\npost-holes. The steel crowbar is for working around the stones to loosen\r\nthem.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 194.--Fence Pliers. This is a heavy fence tool\r\nmade to pull fence staples and to stretch, cut and splice wire.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCORN SHOCK HORSE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 195.--Corn Horse. When corn is cut by hand there\r\nis no better shocking device than the old-style corn horse. It is almost\r\nas handy when setting up the corn sheaves from the corn binder.]\r\n\r\nA convenient corn shocking horse is made with a pole cut from a straight\r\ntree. The pole is about six inches through at the butt and tapers to a\r\nsmall end. About twenty feet is a good length. There are two legs which\r\nhold the large end of the pole up about 40\" from the ground. These legs\r\nare well spread apart at the bottom. Two feet back from the legs is a\r\nhorizontal hole about one and one-quarter inches in diameter to hold the\r\ncrossbar. This crossbar may be an old broom handle. The pole and the\r\ncrossbar mark the four divisions of a corn shock. Corn is cut and stood\r\nup in each corner, usually nine hills in a corner, giving thirty-six\r\nhills to a shock. Corn planted in rows is counted up to make about the\r\nsame amount of corn to the shock. Of course a heavy or light crop must\r\ndetermine the number of rows or hills. When enough corn is cut for a\r\nshock it is tied with two bands, the crossbar is pulled out and the corn\r\nhorse is dragged along to the next stand.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUSKING-PIN\r\n\r\nHand huskers for dividing the cornhusks at the tips of the ears are made\r\nof wood, bone or steel. Wooden husking-pins are made of ironwood,\r\neucalyptus, second growth hickory, or some other tough hardwood. The\r\npin is about four inches long, five-eighths of an inch thick and it is\r\nshaped like a lead-pencil with a rather long point. A recessed girdle is\r\ncut around the barrel of the pin and a leather finger ring fits into and\r\naround this girdle. Generally the leather ring fits the larger finger to\r\nhold the pin in the right position while permitting it to turn to wear\r\nthe point all around alike. Bone husking-pins are generally flat with a\r\nhole through the center to hold the leather finger ring. Steel\r\nhusking-pins are shaped differently and have teeth to catch and tear the\r\nhusks apart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 196.--Brick Trowel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 197.--Plastering Trowel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 198.--Concrete Hog Wallow, showing drain pipe.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 199.--Concrete Center Alley for Hog House. The\r\nupper illustration represents the wooden template used to form the\r\ncenter of the hog house floor.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 200.--Sanitary Pig-Pen. One of the most\r\nsatisfactory farrowing houses is constructed of concrete posts 6\" square\r\nand 6\" square mesh hog fencing and straw. The posts are set to make\r\nfarrowing pens 8' wide and 16' deep from front to back. Woven wire is\r\nstretched and fastened to both sides of the posts at the sides and back\r\nof each pen. Straw is stuffed in between the two wire nets, thus making\r\npartitions of straw 6\" thick and 42\" high. Fence wire is stretched over\r\nthe top and straw piled on deep enough to shed rain. The front of the\r\npens face the south and are closed by wooden gates. In the spring the\r\npigs are turned out on pasture, the straw roof is hauled to the fields\r\nfor manure and the straw partitions burned out. The sun shines into the\r\nskeleton pens all summer so that all mischievous bacteria are killed and\r\nthe hog-lice are burned or starved. The next fall concrete floors may be\r\nlaid in the pens, the partitions restuffed with straw and covered with\r\nanother straw roof. In a colder climate I would cover the whole top with\r\na straw roof. Sufficient ventilation would work through the straw\r\npartitions and the front gate. In very cold weather add a thin layer of\r\nstraw to the gate.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 201.--Concrete Wall Mold. Wooden molds for shaping\r\na concrete wall may be made as shown. If the wall is to be low--2' or\r\nless--the mold will stay in place without bolting or wiring the sides\r\ntogether. The form is made level by first leveling the 2\" x 6\" stringers\r\nthat support the form.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 202.--Husking-Pin. The leather finger ring is\r\nlooped into the recess in the wooden pin.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 203.--Harness Punch. The hollow punch points are\r\nof different sizes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 204.--Belt Punch. Two or three sizes should be\r\nkept in the tool box. Belt holes should be small to hold the lace tight.\r\nThe smooth running of belts depends a good deal on the lacing. Holes\r\npunch better against the end of a hickory block or other fine grained\r\nhardwood.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPAINT BRUSHES\r\n\r\nPaint brushes may be left in the paint for a year without apparent\r\ninjury. The paint should be deep enough to nearly bury the bristles.\r\nPour a little boiled linseed oil over the top to form a skin to keep the\r\nair out. It is cheaper to buy a new brush than to clean the paint out of\r\none that has been used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 205.--Knots. The simple principles of knot tying\r\nas practiced on farms are here represented.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 206.--Sheepshank, two half hitches in a rope to\r\ntake up slack. The rope may be folded upon itself as many times as\r\nnecessary.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 207.--Marline Spike. Used for splicing ropes,\r\ntying rose knots, etc.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUIT PICKING\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 208.--Fruit-Picking Tray. It is used for picking\r\ngrapes and other fruits. The California lug box has vertical sides and\r\nis the same size top and bottom. Otherwise the construction is similar.]\r\n\r\nApples are handled as carefully as eggs by men who understand the\r\nbusiness of getting high prices. Picking boxes for apples have bothered\r\norchard men more than any other part of the business. It is so difficult\r\nto get help to handle apples without bruising that many inventions have\r\nbeen tried to lessen the damage. In western New York a tray with\r\nvertical ends and slanting sides has been adopted by grape growers as\r\nthe most convenient tray for grapes. Apple growers are adopting the same\r\ntray. It is made of three-eighths-inch lumber cut 30 inches long for the\r\nsides, using two strips for each side. The bottom is 30 inches long and\r\nthree-eighths of an inch thick, made in one piece. The ends are\r\nseven-eighths of an inch thick cut to a bevel so the top edge of the end\r\npiece is fourteen inches long and the bottom edge is ten inches long.\r\nThe depth of the end piece is eight inches. Hand cleats are nailed on\r\nthe outsides of the end pieces so as to project one-half inch above the\r\ntop. These cleats not only serve to lift and carry the trays, but when\r\nthey are loaded on a wagon the bottoms fit in between the cleats to hold\r\nthem from slipping endways. In piling these picking boxes empty, one\r\nend is slipped outward over the cleat until the other end drops down.\r\nThis permits half nesting when the boxes are piled up for storage or\r\nwhen loaded on wagons to move to the orchard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 209.--Fruit Thinning Nippers. Three styles of\r\napple-stem cutters are shown. They are also used for picking grapes and\r\nother fruits.]\r\n\r\nApples are picked into the trays from the trees. The trays are loaded on\r\nto wagons or stone-boats and hauled to the packing shed, where the\r\napples are rolled out gently over the sloping sides of the crates on to\r\nthe cushioned bottom of the sorting table. Orchard men should have\r\ncrates enough to keep the pickers busy without emptying until they are\r\nhauled to the packing shed. The use of such trays or crates save\r\nhandling the apples over several times. The less apples are handled the\r\nfewer bruises are made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 210.--Apple Picking Ladder. When apples are picked\r\nand placed in bushel trays a ladder on wheels with shelves is convenient\r\nfor holding the trays.]\r\n\r\nIn California similar trays are used, but they have straight sides and\r\nare called lug boxes. Eastern fruit men prefer the sloping sides because\r\nthey may be emptied easily, quickly and gently.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUIT PICKING LADDERS\r\n\r\nCommercial orchards are pruned to keep the bearing fruit spurs as near\r\nthe ground as possible, so that ladders used at picking time are not so\r\nlong as they used to be.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 211.--Stepladder and Apple-Picking Bag. This\r\nladder has only three feet, but the bottom of the ladder is made wide to\r\nprevent upsetting. This bag is useful when picking scattering apples on\r\nthe outer or upper branches. Picking bags carelessly used are the cause\r\nof many bruised apples.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 212.--Tree Pruners. The best made pruners are the\r\ncheapest. This long handled pruner is made of fine tool steel from the\r\ncutting parts clear to the outer ends of the wooden handles. A positive\r\nstop prevents the handles from coming together. Small one-hand pruning\r\nnippers are made for clean cutting. The blades of both pruners should\r\nwork towards the tree trunk so the hook will mash the bark on the\r\ndiscarded portion of the limb.]\r\n\r\nThe illustration shows one of the most convenient picking ladders. It is\r\na double ladder with shelves to hold picking trays supported by two\r\nwheels and two legs. The wheels which are used to support one side of\r\nthe frame are usually old buggy wheels. A hind axle together with the\r\nwheels works about right. The ladder frame is about eight feet high with\r\nladder steps going up from each side. These steps also form the support\r\nfor the shelves. Picking trays or boxes are placed on the shelves, so\r\nthe latter will hold eight or ten bushels of apples, and may be wheeled\r\ndirectly to the packing shed if the distance is not too great.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 213.--Shears. The first pair is used for sheep\r\nshearing. The second is intended for cutting grass around the edges of\r\nwalks and flower beds.]\r\n\r\nStep-ladders from six to ten feet long are more convenient to get up\r\ninto the middle of the tree than almost any other kind of ladder.\r\nCommercial apple trees have open tops to admit sunshine. For this\r\nreason, straight ladders are not much used. It is necessary to have\r\nladders built so they will support themselves. Sometimes only one leg is\r\nused in front of a step-ladder and sometimes ladders are wide at the\r\nbottom and taper to a point at the top. The kind of ladder to use\r\ndepends upon the size of the trees and the manner in which they have\r\nbeen pruned. Usually it is better to have several kinds of ladders of\r\ndifferent sizes and lengths. Pickers then have no occasion to wait for\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDING RACKS\r\n\r\nSpecial racks for the feeding of alfalfa hay to hogs are built with\r\nslatted sides hinged at the top so they will swing in when the hogs\r\ncrowd their noses through to get the hay. This movement drops the hay\r\ndown within reach. Alfalfa hay is especially valuable as a winter feed\r\nfor breeding stock. Sows may be wintered on alfalfa with one ear of\r\ncorn a day and come out in the spring in fit condition to suckle a fine\r\nlitter of pigs. Alfalfa is a strong protein feed. It furnishes the\r\nmuscle-forming substances necessary for the young litter by causing a\r\ncopious flow of milk. One ear of corn a day is sufficient to keep the\r\nsow in good condition without laying on too much fat. When shoats are\r\nfed in the winter for fattening, alfalfa hay helps them to grow. In\r\nconnection with grain it increases the weight rapidly without adding a\r\ngreat deal of expense to the ration. Alfalfa in every instance is\r\nintended as a roughage, as an appetizer and as a protein feed. Fat must\r\nbe added by the use of corn, kaffir corn, Canada peas, barley or other\r\ngrains. Alfalfa hay is intended to take the place of summer pasture in\r\nwinter more than as a fattening ration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 214.--Horse Feeding Rack. This is a barnyard hay\r\nfeeder for horses and colts. The diagonal boarding braces each corner\r\npost and leaves large openings at the sides. Horses shy at small hay\r\nholes. The top boards and the top rail are 2 x 4s for strength. The\r\nbottom is floored to save the chaff.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 215.--Corner Post Detail of Horse Feeding Rack. A\r\n2 x 6 is spiked into the edge of a 2 x 4, making a corner post 6\"\r\nacross. The side boarding is cut even with the corner of the post and\r\nthe open corner is filled with a two-inch quarter-round as shown.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 216.--Automatic Hog Feeder. The little building is\r\n8' x 12' on the ground and it is 10' high to the plates. The crushed\r\ngrain is shoveled in from behind and it feeds down hopper fashion as\r\nfast as the hogs eat it. The floor is made of matched lumber. It should\r\nstand on a dry concrete floor.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 217.--Sheep Feeding Rack. The hay bottom and grain\r\ntrough sides slope together at 45 deg. angles. The boarding is made tight to\r\nhold chaff and grain from wasting.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 218.--Rack Base and Sides. The 2 x 4s are halved\r\nat the ends and put together at right angles. These frames are placed 3'\r\napart and covered with matched flooring. Light braces should be nailed\r\nacross these frames a few inches up from the ground. The 1 x 4 pickets\r\nare placed 7\" apart in the clear, so the sheep can get their heads\r\nthrough to feed. These picketed frames are bolted to the base and framed\r\naround the top. If the rack is more than 9' long there should be a\r\ncenter tie or partition. Twelve feet is a good length to make the\r\nracks.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSPLIT-LOG ROAD DRAG\r\n\r\nThe only low cost road grader of value is the split-log road drag. It\r\nshould be exactly what the name implies. It should be made from a light\r\nlog about eight inches in diameter split through the middle with a saw.\r\nPlenty of road drags are made of timbers instead of split logs, but the\r\nreal principle is lost because such drags are too heavy and clumsy.\r\nThey cannot be quickly adjusted to the varying road conditions met with\r\nwhile in use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 219.--Hog Trough. In a winter hog house the feed\r\ntrough is placed next to the alley or passageway. A cement trough is\r\nbest. A drop gate is hinged over the trough so it can be swung in while\r\nputting feed in the trough. The same gate is opened up level to admit\r\nhogs to the pen.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 220.--Reinforced Hog Trough. The section of hog\r\ntrough to the left is reinforced with chicken wire, one-inch mesh. The\r\ntrough to the right is reinforced with seven 1/4\" rods--three in the\r\nbottom and two in each side.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 221.--Double Poultry Feeding Trough with Partition\r\nin the Center.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 222.--Poultry Feeder with Metal or Crockery\r\nReceptacle.]\r\n\r\nThe illustration shows the right way of making a road drag, and the\r\nmanner in which it is drawn along at an angle to the roadway so as to\r\nmove the earth from the sides towards the center, but illustrations\r\nare useless for showing how to operate them to do good work. The\r\neccentricities of a split-log road drag may be learned in one lesson by\r\nriding it over a mile or two of country road shortly after the frost has\r\nleft the ground in the spring of the year. It will be noticed that the\r\nfront half of the road drag presents the flat side of the split log to\r\nthe work of shaving off the lumps while the other half log levels and\r\nsmooths and puddles the loosened moist earth by means of the rounded\r\nside. Puddling makes earth waterproof. The front, or cutting edge, is\r\nfaced with steel. The ridges and humps are cut and shoved straight ahead\r\nor to one side to fill holes and ruts. This is done by the driver, who\r\nshifts his weight from one end to the other, and from front to back of\r\nhis standing platform to distribute the earth to the best advantage. The\r\nrounded side of the rear half log presses the soft earth into place and\r\nleaves the surface smooth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 223.--Split-Log Road Drag. The front edge is shod\r\nwith a steel plate to do the cutting and the round side of the rear log\r\ngrinds the loosened earth fine and presses it into the wagon tracks and\r\nwater holes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 224.--Heavy Breaking Plow, used for road work and\r\nother tough jobs.]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the habit of using narrow tired wagons on country roads\r\nhas become almost universal in the United States. To add to their\r\ndestructive propensities, all wagons in some parts of the country have\r\nthe same width of tread so that each wheel follows in paths made by\r\nother wheels, until they cut ruts of considerable depth. These little\r\nnarrow ditches hold water so that it cannot run off into the drains at\r\nthe sides of the roadway. When a rut gets started, each passing wheel\r\nsqueezes out the muddy water, or if the wheel be revolving at a speed\r\nfaster than a walk it throws the water, and the water carries part of\r\nthe roadway with it so that small ruts are made large and deep ruts are\r\nmade deeper. In some limited sections road rules demand that wagons\r\nshall have wide tires and have shorter front axles, so that with the\r\nwide tires and the uneven treads the wheels act as rollers instead of\r\nrut makers. It is difficult to introduce such requirements into every\r\nfarm section. In the meantime the evils of narrow tires may be overcome\r\nto a certain extent by the persistent and proper use of the split-log\r\nroad drag. These drags are most effectual in the springtime when the\r\nfrost is coming out of the ground. During the muddy season the roads get\r\nworked up into ruts and mire holes, which, if taken in time, may be\r\nfilled by running lengthwise of the road with the drag when the earth is\r\nstill soft. When the ground shows dry on top and is still soft and wet\r\nunderneath is the time the drags do the best work by scraping the drier\r\nhummocks into the low places where the earth settles hard as it dries.\r\n\r\nA well rounded, smooth road does not get muddy in the summer time.\r\nSummer rains usually come with a dash. Considerable water falls in a\r\nshort time, and the very act of falling with force first lays the dust,\r\nthen packs the surface. The smooth packed surface acts like a roof, and\r\nalmost before the rain stops falling all surface water is drained off to\r\nthe sides so that an inch down under the surface the roadbed is as hard\r\nas it was before the rain. That is the reason why split log road drags\r\nused persistently in the spring and occasionally later in the season\r\nwill preserve good roads all summer. It is very much better to follow\r\neach summer rain with the road drag, but it is not so necessary as\r\nimmediate attention at the proper time in spring. Besides, farmers are\r\nso busy during the summer months that they find it difficult to spend\r\nthe time. In some sections of the middle West one man is hired to do the\r\ndragging at so much per trip over the road. He makes his calculations\r\naccordingly and is prepared to do the dragging at all seasons when\r\nneeded. This plan usually works out the best because one man then makes\r\nit his business and he gets paid for the amount of work performed. This\r\nman should live at the far end of the road division so that he can\r\nsmooth his own pathway leading to town.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEEL ROAD DRAG\r\n\r\nManufacturers are making road drags of steel with tempered blades\r\nadjustable to any angle by simply moving the lever until the dog engages\r\nin the proper notch. Some of these machines are made with blades\r\nreversible, so that the other side can be used for cutting when the\r\nfirst edge is worn. For summer use the steel drag works very well, but\r\nit lacks the smoothing action of a well balanced log drag.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEED HOUSE AND BARN TRUCKS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 225.--Barn Trucks. The platform truck is made to\r\nmove boxed apples and other fruit. The bag truck is well proportioned\r\nand strong, but is not full ironed.]\r\n\r\nBag trucks for handling bags of grain and seeds should be heavy. Bag\r\ntruck wheels should be eight inches in diameter with a three-inch face.\r\nThe steel bar or shoe that lifts and carries the bag should be\r\ntwenty-two inches in length. That means that the bottom of the truck in\r\nfront is twenty-two inches wide. The wheels run behind this bar so the\r\nhubs do not project to catch against standing bags or door frames. The\r\nlength of truck handles from the steel lift bar to the top end of the\r\nhand crook is four feet, six inches. In buying bag trucks it is better\r\nto get the heavy solid kind that will not upset. The light ones are a\r\ngreat nuisance when running them over uneven floors. The wheels are too\r\nnarrow and too close together and the trucks tip over under slight\r\nprovocation. Platform trucks for use in moving boxes of apples or crates\r\nof potatoes or bags of seed in the seed house or warehouse also should\r\nbe heavy. The most approved platform truck, the kind that market men\r\nuse, is made with a frame four feet in length by two feet in width. The\r\nframe is made of good solid hardwood put together with mortise and\r\ntenon. The cross pieces or stiles are three-quarters of an inch lower\r\nthan the side pieces or rails, which space is filled with hardwood\r\nflooring boards firmly bolted to the cross pieces so they come up flush\r\nwith the side timbers. The top of the platform should be sixteen inches\r\nup from the floor. There are two standards in front which carry a\r\nwooden crossbar over the front end of the truck. This crossbar is used\r\nfor a handle to push or pull the truck. The height of the handle-bar\r\nfrom the floor is three feet. Rear wheels are five inches in diameter\r\nand work on a swivel so they turn in any direction like a castor. The\r\ntwo front wheels carry the main weight. They are twelve inches in\r\ndiameter with a three-inch face. The wheels are bored to fit a one-inch\r\nsteel axle and have wide boxings bolted to the main timbers of the truck\r\nframe. Like the two-wheel bag truck, the wheels of the platform truck\r\nare under the frame so they do not project out in the way, which is a\r\ngreat advantage when the truck is being used in a crowded place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 226.--Farm Gate Post with Copper Mail Box.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 227.--Concrete Post Supporting a Waterproof\r\nClothes Line Reel Box.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 228.--Dumb Waiter. The cage is poised by a\r\ncounterweight. It is guided by a rope belt which runs on grooved pulleys\r\nat the top and bottom.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME CANNING OUTFIT\r\n\r\nThere are small canning outfits manufactured and sold for farm use that\r\nwork on the factory principle. For canning vegetables, the heating is\r\ndone under pressure because a great deal of heat is necessary to destroy\r\nthe bacteria that spoil vegetables in the cans. Steam under pressure is\r\na good deal hotter than boiling water. There is considerable work in\r\nusing a canning outfit, but it gets the canning out of the way quickly.\r\nExtra help may be employed for a few days to do the canning on the same\r\nprinciple that farmers employ extra help at threshing time and do it all\r\nup at once. Of course, fruits and vegetables keep coming along at\r\ndifferent times in the summer, but the fall fruit canning may be done at\r\ntwo or three sittings arranged a week or two apart and enough fruit\r\npacked away in the cellar to last a big family a whole year. Canning\r\nmachinery is simple and inexpensive. These outfits may be bought from\r\n$10 up. Probably a $20 or $25 canner would be large enough for a large\r\nfamily, or a dozen different families if it could be run on a\r\nco-operative plan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 229.--Clothes Line Tightener. This device is made\r\nof No. 9 wire bent as shown in the illustration.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 230.--Goat Stall. Milch goats are milked on a\r\nraised platform. Feed is placed in the manger.

The flexible shaft clipper to the right may be turned by hand\r\nfor clipping a few horses or shearing a few sheep, but for real business\r\nit should be driven by an electric motor.]\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRIC TOWEL\r\n\r\nThe \"air towel\" is sanitary, as well as an economical method of drying\r\nthe hands. A foot pedal closes a quick-acting switch, thereby putting\r\ninto operation a blower that forces air through an electric heating\r\ndevice so arranged as to distribute the warmed air to all parts of the\r\nhands at the same time. The supply of hot air continues as long as the\r\nfoot pedal is depressed. The hands are thoroughly dried in thirty\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTALLS FOR MILCH GOATS\r\n\r\nMilch goats are not fastened with stanchions like cows. The front of the\r\nmanger is boarded tight with the exception of a round hole about two\r\nfeet high and a slit in the boards reaching from the round opening to\r\nwithin a few inches of the floor. The round hole is made large enough so\r\nthat the goat puts her head through to reach the feed, and the slit is\r\nnarrow enough so she cannot back up to pull the feed out into the stall.\r\nThis is a device to save fodder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 232.--Hog Catching Hook. The wooden handle fits\r\nloosely into the iron socket. As soon as the hog's hind leg is engaged\r\nthe wooden handle is removed and the rope held taut.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTABLE HELPS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 233.--Bull Nose-Chain. Cross bulls may be turned\r\nout to pasture with some degree of safety by snapping a chain like this\r\ninto the nose-ring. The chain should be just long enough to swing and\r\nwrap around the bull's front legs when he is running. Also the length is\r\nintended to drag the ring where he will step on it with his front feet.\r\nThere is some danger of pulling the nose ring out.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 234.--Manure Carriers. There are two kinds of\r\nmanure carriers in general use. The principal difference is the elevator\r\nattachment for hoisting when the spreader stands too high for the usual\r\nlevel dump.]\r\n\r\nOverhead tracks have made feed carriers possible. Litter or feed\r\ncarriers and manure carriers run on the same kind of a track, the only\r\ndifference is in size and shape of the car and the manner in which the\r\ncontents are unloaded. Manure carriers and litter carriers have a\r\ncontinuous track that runs along over the manure gutters and overhead\r\nlengthwise of the feed alleys. There are a number of different kinds of\r\ncarriers manufactured, all of which seem to do good service. The object\r\nis to save labor in doing the necessary work about dairy stables. To get\r\nthe greatest possible profit from cows, it is absolutely necessary that\r\nthe stable should be kept clean and sanitary, also that the cows shall\r\nbe properly fed several times a day. Different kinds of feed are given\r\nat the different feeding periods. It is impossible to have all the\r\ndifferent kinds of food stored in sufficient quantities within easy\r\nreach of the cows. Hence, the necessity of installing some mechanical\r\narrangement to fetch and carry. The only floor carrier in use in dairy\r\nstables is a truck for silage. Not in every stable is this the case.\r\nSometimes a feed carrier is run directly to the silo. It depends a good\r\ndeal on the floor what kind of a carrier is best for silage. The\r\nadvantage of an overhead track is, that it is always free from litter.\r\nWhere floor trucks are used, it is necessary to keep the floor bare of\r\nobstruction. This is not considered a disadvantage because the floor\r\nshould be kept clean anyway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 235.--Cow Stanchion. Wooden cow stanchions may be\r\nmade as comfortable for the cows as the iron ones.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSE PLUMBING\r\n\r\nWhen water is pumped by an engine and stored for use in a tank to be\r\ndelivered under pressure in the house, then the additional cost of hot\r\nand cold water and the necessary sink and bath room fixtures is\r\ncomparatively small. Modern plumbing fixtures fit so perfectly and go\r\ntogether so easily that the cost of installing house plumbing in the\r\ncountry has been materially reduced, while the dangers from noxious\r\ngases have been entirely eliminated. Open ventilator pipes carry the\r\npoisonous gases up through the roof of the house to float harmlessly\r\naway in the atmosphere. Septic tanks take care of the sewerage better\r\nthan the sewer systems in some towns. Plumbing fixtures may be cheap or\r\nexpensive, according to the wishes and pocketbook of the owner. The\r\ncheaper grades are just as useful, but there are expensive outfits that\r\nare very much more ornamental.\r\n\r\n\r\nFARM SEPTIC TANK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 236.--Frame for Holding Record Sheets in a Dairy\r\nStable.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 237.--Loading Shute for Hogs. This loading shute\r\nis made portable and may be moved like a wheelbarrow.]\r\n\r\nSupplying water under pressure in the farmhouse demands a septic tank to\r\nget rid of the waste. A septic tank is a scientific receptacle to take\r\nthe poison out of sewerage. It is a simple affair consisting of two\r\nunderground compartments, made water-tight, with a sewer pipe to lead\r\nthe waste water from the house into the first compartment and a drain to\r\ncarry the denatured sewerage away from the second compartment. The first\r\ncompartment is open to the atmosphere, through a ventilator, but the\r\nsecond compartment is made as nearly air-tight as possible. The\r\nscientific working of a septic tank depends upon the destructive work of\r\ntwo kinds of microscopic life known as aerobic and anaerobic forms of\r\nbacteria. Sewerage in the first tank is worked over by aerobic bacteria,\r\nthe kind that require a small amount of oxygen in order to live and\r\ncarry on their work. The second compartment is inhabited by anaerobic\r\nbacteria, or forms of microscopic life that work practically without\r\nair. The principles of construction require that a septic tank shall be\r\nlarge enough to contain two days' supply of sewerage in each\r\ncompartment; thus, requiring four days for the sewerage to enter and\r\nleave the tank.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 238.--Brass Valves. Two kinds of globe valves are\r\nused in farm waterworks. The straight valve shown to the left and the\r\nright angle valve to the right. Either one may be fitted with a long\r\nshank to reach above ground when pipes are laid deep to prevent\r\nfreezing.]\r\n\r\nEstimating 75 gallons daily of sewerage for each inhabitant of the house\r\nand four persons to a family, the septic tank should be large enough to\r\nhold 600 gallons, three hundred gallons in each compartment, which\r\nwould require a tank about four feet in width and six feet in length and\r\nfour feet in depth. These figures embrace more cubic feet of tank than\r\nnecessary to meet the foregoing requirements. It is a good plan to leave\r\na margin of safety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 239.--Septic Tank, a double antiseptic process for\r\npurifying sewerage.]\r\n\r\nIt is usual to lay a vitrified sewer, four inches in diameter, from\r\nbelow the bottom of the cellar to the septic tank, giving it a fall of\r\none-eighth inch in ten feet. The sewer enters the tank at the top of the\r\nstanding liquid and delivers the fresh sewerage from the house through\r\nan elbow and a leg of pipe that reaches to within about six inches of\r\nthe bottom of the tank. The reason for this is to admit fresh sewerage\r\nwithout disturbing the scum on the surface of the liquid in the tank.\r\nThe scum is a protection for the bacteria. It helps them to carry on\r\ntheir work of destruction. The same principle applies to the second\r\ncompartment. The liquid from the first compartment is carried over into\r\nthe second compartment by means of a bent pipe in the form of a siphon\r\nwhich fills up gradually and empties automatically when the liquid in\r\nthe first compartment rises to a certain level. The discharging siphon\r\nleg should be the shortest. The liquid from the second compartment is\r\ndischarged into the drain in the same manner. There are special valves\r\nmade for the final discharge, but they are not necessary. The bottom of\r\nthe tank is dug deep enough to hold sewerage from two to four feet in\r\ndepth. The top surface of the liquid in the tank is held down to a level\r\nof at least six inches below the bottom of the cellar. So there is no\r\npossible chance of the house sewer filling and backing up towards the\r\nhouse. Usually the vitrified sewer pipe is four inches in diameter, the\r\nseptic tank siphons for a small tank are three inches in diameter and\r\nthe final discharge pipe is three inches in diameter, with a rapid fall\r\nfor the first ten feet after leaving the tank.\r\n\r\nSeptic tanks should be made of concrete, waterproofed on the inside to\r\nprevent the possibility of seepage. Septic tank tops are made of\r\nreinforced concrete with manhole openings. Also the manhole covers are\r\nmade of reinforced concrete, either beveled to fit the openings or made\r\nconsiderably larger than the opening, so that they sit down flat on the\r\ntop surface of the tank. These covers are always deep enough down in the\r\nground so that when covered over the earth holds them in place.\r\n\r\nIn laying vitrified sewer it is absolutely necessary to calk each joint\r\nwith okum or lead, or okum reinforced with cement. It is almost\r\nimpossible to make a joint tight with cement alone, although it can be\r\ndone by an expert. Each length of the sewer-pipe should be given a\r\nuniform grade. The vitrified sewer is trapped outside of the building\r\nwith an ordinary S-trap ventilated, which leaves the sewer open to the\r\natmosphere and prevents the possibility of back-pressure that might\r\ndrive the poisonous gases from the decomposing sewerage through the\r\nsewer back into the house. In this way, the septic tank is made entirely\r\nseparate from the house plumbing, except that the two systems are\r\nconnected at this outside trap.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes recommended that the waste water from the second\r\ncompartment shall be distributed through a series of drains made with\r\nthree-inch or four-inch drain tile and that the outlet of this set of\r\ndrains shall empty into or connect with a regularly organized field\r\ndrainage system. Generally speaking, the final discharge of liquid from\r\na septic tank that is properly constructed is inoffensive and harmless.\r\nHowever, it is better to use every possible precaution to preserve the\r\nhealth of the family, and it is better to dispose of the final waste in\r\nsuch a way as to prevent any farm animal from drinking it.\r\n\r\nWhile manholes are built into septic tanks for the purpose of\r\nexamination, in practice they are seldom required. If the tanks are\r\nproperly built and rightly proportioned to the sewerage requirements\r\nthey will take care of the waste water from the house year after year\r\nwithout attention. Should any accidents occur, they are more likely to\r\nbe caused by a leakage in the vitrified sewer than from any other cause.\r\nManufacturers of plumbing supplies furnish the siphons together with\r\ninstructions for placing them properly in the concrete walls. Some firms\r\nsupply advertising matter from which to work out the actual size and\r\nproportions of the different compartments and all connections. The\r\nmaking of a septic tank is simple when the principle is once\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  PAGE\r\n\r\n  Acetylene gas
