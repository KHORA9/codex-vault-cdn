HASTINGS\r\n\r\nFORMERLY POULTRYMAN AT\r\nKANSAS EXPERIMENT STATION;\r\nLATER IN CHARGE OF THE COMMERCIAL\r\nPOULTRY INVESTIGATION\r\nOF THE UNITED STATES\r\nDEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nSYRACUSE\r\n\r\nNATIONAL POULTRY MAGAZINE\r\n\r\n1911\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHT, 1911,\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nNATIONAL POULTRY PUBLISHING COMPANY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years ago there were in print hundreds of complete\r\ntreatises on human diseases and the practice of medicine.\r\nNotwithstanding the size of the book-shelves or the high standing of\r\nthe authorities, one might have read the entire medical library of\r\nthat day and still have remained in ignorance of the fact that\r\nout-door life is a better cure for consumption than the contents of\r\na drug store. The medical professor of 1885 may have gone\r\nprematurely to his grave because of ignorance of facts which are\r\nto-day the property of every intelligent man.\r\n\r\nThere are to-day on the book-shelves of agricultural colleges and\r\npublic libraries, scores of complete works on \"Poultry\" and hundreds\r\nof minor writings on various phases of the industry. Let the\r\nwould-be poultryman master this entire collection of literature and\r\nhe is still in ignorance of facts and principles, a knowledge of\r\nwhich in better developed industries would be considered prime\r\nnecessities for carrying on the business.\r\n\r\nAs a concrete illustration of the above statement, I want to point\r\nto a young man, intelligent, enterprising, industrious, and a\r\ngraduate of the best known agricultural college poultry course in\r\nthe country. This lad invested some $18,000 of his own and his\r\nfriends' money in a poultry plant. The plant was built and the\r\nbusiness conducted in accordance with the plans and principles of\r\nthe recognized poultry authorities. To-day the young man is bravely\r\nfacing the proposition of working on a salary in another business,\r\nto pay back the debts of honor resulting from his attempt to apply\r\nin practice the teaching of our agricultural colleges and our\r\npoultry bookshelves.\r\n\r\nThe experience just related did not prove disastrous from some\r\nsingle item of ignorance or oversight; the difficulty was that the\r\ncost of growing and marketing the product amounted to more than the\r\nreceipts from its sale. This poultry farm, like the surgeon's\r\noperation, \"was successful, but the patient died.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer's belief in the reality of the situation as above\r\nportrayed warrants him in publishing the present volume. Whether his\r\ncriticism of poultry literature is founded on fact or fancy may,\r\nfive years after the copyright date of this book, be told by any\r\nunbiased observer.\r\n\r\nI have written this book for the purpose of assisting in placing the\r\npoultry business on a sound scientific and economic basis. The book\r\ndoes not pretend to be a complete encyclopedia of information\r\nconcerning poultry, but treats only of those phases of poultry\r\nproduction and marketing upon which the financial success of the\r\nbusiness depends.\r\n\r\nThe reader who is looking for information concerning fancy breeds,\r\npoultry shows, patent processes, patent foods, or patent methods,\r\nwill be disappointed, for the object of this book is to help the\r\npoultryman to make money, not to spend it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO READ THIS BOOK\r\n\r\nUnless the reader has picked up this volume out of idle curiosity,\r\nhe will be one of the following individuals:\r\n\r\n1. A farmer or would-be farmer, who is interested in poultry\r\nproduction as a portion of the work of general farming.\r\n\r\n2. A poultryman or would-be poultryman, who wishes to make a\r\nbusiness of producing poultry or eggs for sale as a food product or\r\nas breeding stock.\r\n\r\n3. A person interested in poultry as a diversion and who enjoys\r\nlosing a dollar on his chickens almost as well as earning one.\r\n\r\n4. A man interested in poultry in the capacity of an editor, teacher\r\nor some one engaged as a manufacturer or dealer in merchandise the\r\nsale of which is dependent upon the welfare of the poultry industry.\r\n\r\nTo the reader of the fourth class I have no suggestions to make save\r\nsuch as he will find in the suggestions made to others.\r\n\r\nTo the reader of the third class I wish to say that if you are a\r\nshoe salesman, who has spent your evenings in a Brooklyn flat,\r\ndrawing up plans for a poultry plant, I have only to apologize for\r\nany interference that this book may cause with your highly\r\nfascinating amusement.\r\n\r\nTo the poultryman already in the business, or to the man who is\r\nplanning to engage in the business for reasons equivalent to those\r\nwhich would justify his entering other occupations of the\r\nsemi-technical class, such as dairying, fruit growing or the\r\nmanufacture of washing machines, I wish to say it is for you that\r\n\"The Dollar Hen\" is primarily written.\r\n\r\nThis book does not assume you to be a graduate of a technical\r\nschool, but it does bring up discussions and use methods of\r\nillustration that may be unfamiliar to many readers. That such\r\nmatter is introduced is because the subject requires it; and if it\r\nis confusing to the student he will do better to master it than to\r\ndodge it. Especially would I call your attention to the diagrams\r\nused in illustrating various statistics. Such diagrams are\r\ntechnically called \"curves.\" They may at first seem mere crooked\r\nlines, if so I suggest that you get a series of figures in which you\r\nare interested, such as the daily egg yields of your own flock or\r\nyour monthly food bills, and \"plot\" a few curves of your own. After\r\nyou catch on you will be surprised at the greater ease with which\r\nthe true meaning of a series of figures can be recognized when this\r\ngraphic method is used.\r\n\r\nI wish to call the farmer's attention to the fact that poultry\r\nkeeping as an adjunct to general farming, especially to general\r\nfarming in the Mississippi Valley, is quite a different proposition\r\nfrom poultry production as a regular business. Poultry keeping as a\r\npart of farm life and farm enterprise is a thing well worth while in\r\nany section of the United States, whereas poultry keeping, a\r\nseparate occupation, requires special location and special\r\nconditions to make it profitable. I would suggest the farmer first\r\nread Chapter XVI, which is devoted to his special conditions. Later\r\nhe may read the remainder of the book, but should again consult the\r\npart on farm poultry production before attempting to apply the more\r\ncomplicated methods to his own needs.\r\n\r\nChapter XVI, while written primarily for the farmer, is, because of\r\nthe simplicity of its directions, the best general guide for the\r\nbeginner in poultry keeping wherever he may be.\r\n\r\nTo the reader in general, I want to say, that the table of contents,\r\na part of the book which most people never read, is in this volume\r\nso placed and so arranged that it cannot well be avoided. Read it\r\nbefore you begin the rest of the book, and use it then and\r\nthereafter in guiding you toward the facts that you at the time\r\nparticularly want to know. Many people in starting to read a book\r\nfind something in the first chapter which does not interest them and\r\ncast aside the work, often missing just the information they are\r\nseeking. The conspicuous arrangement of the contents is for the\r\npurpose of preventing such an occurrence in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    WHAT IS IN THIS VOLUME\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n    IS THERE MONEY IN THE POULTRY BUSINESS?\r\n      A Big Business; Growing Bigger\r\n      Less Ham and More Eggs\r\n      Who Gets the Hen Money?\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n    WHAT BRANCH OF THE POULTRY BUSINESS?\r\n      Various Poultry Products\r\n      The Duck Business\r\n      Squabs Have Been Overdone\r\n      Turkeys not Adapted to Commercial Growing\r\n      Guinea Growing a New Venture\r\n      Geese, the Fame of Watertown\r\n      The Ill-omened Broiler Business\r\n      South Shore Roasters\r\n      Too Much Competition in Fancy Poultry\r\n      Egg Farming the Most Certain and Profitable\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n    THE POULTRY PRODUCING COMMUNITY\r\n      Established Poultry Communities\r\n      Developing Poultry Communities\r\n      Will Co-operation Work?\r\n      Co-operative Egg Marketing in Denmark\r\n      Corporation or Co-operation\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n    WHERE TO LOCATE\r\n      Some Poultry Geography\r\n      Chicken Climate\r\n      Suitable Soil\r\n      Marketing--Transportation\r\n      Availability of Water\r\n      A Few Statistics\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n    THE DOLLAR HEN FARM\r\n      The Plan of Housing\r\n      The Feeding System\r\n      Water Systems\r\n      Out-door Accommodations\r\n      Equipment for Chick Rearing\r\n      Twenty-five Acre Poultry Farms\r\n      Five Acre Poultry Farms\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n    INCUBATION\r\n      Fertility of Eggs\r\n      The Wisdom of the Egyptians\r\n      Principles of Incubation\r\n      Moisture and Evaporation\r\n      Ventilation--Carbon Dioxide\r\n      Turning Eggs\r\n      Cooling Eggs\r\n      Searching for the \"Open Sesame\" of Incubation\r\n      The Box Type of Incubator in Actual Use\r\n      The Future of Incubation\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n    FEEDING\r\n      Conventional Food Chemistry\r\n      How the Hen Unbalances Balanced Rations\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n    DISEASES\r\n      Don't Doctor Chickens\r\n      The Causes of Poultry Diseases\r\n      Chicken Cholera\r\n      Roup\r\n      Chicken-pox, Gapes, Limber-neck\r\n      Lice and Mites\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n    POULTRY FLESH AND POULTRY FATTENING\r\n      Crate Fattening\r\n      Caponizing\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n    MARKETING POULTRY CARCASSES\r\n      Farm Grown Chickens\r\n      The Special Poultry Plant\r\n      Suggestions From Other Countries\r\n      Cold Storage of Poultry\r\n      Drawn or Undrawn Fowls\r\n      Poultry Inspection\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n    QUALITY IN EGGS\r\n      Grading Eggs\r\n      How Eggs are Spoiled\r\n      Egg Size Table\r\n      The Loss Due to Carelessness\r\n      Requisites of Producing High Grade Eggs\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n    HOW EGGS ARE MARKETED\r\n      The Country Merchant\r\n      The Huckster\r\n      The Produce Buyer\r\n      The City Distribution of Eggs\r\n      Cold Storage of Eggs\r\n      Preserving Eggs Out of Cold Storage\r\n      Improved Methods of Marketing Farm-Grown Eggs\r\n      The High Grade Egg Business\r\n      Buying Eggs by Weight\r\n      The Retailing of Eggs by the Producer\r\n      The Price of Eggs\r\n      N.Y.

No one knows how big it is and no one\r\ncan find out. The reason it is hard to find out is because so many\r\npeople are engaged in it and because the chicken crop is sold, not\r\nonce a year, but a hundred times a year.\r\n\r\nStatistics are guesses. True statistics are the sum of little\r\nguesses, but often figures published as statistics are big guesses\r\nby a guesser who is big enough to have his guess accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Big Business; Growing Bigger\r\n\r\nThe only real statistics for the poultry crop of the United States\r\nare those of the Federal Census. At this writing these statistics\r\nare nine years old and somewhat out of date. The value of poultry\r\nand eggs in 1899, according to the census figures, was $291,000,000.\r\nIs this too big or too little? I don't know. If the reader wishes to\r\nknow let him imagine the census enumerator asking a farmer the value\r\nof the poultry and eggs which he has produced the previous year.\r\nWould the farmer's guess be too big or too small?\r\n\r\nFrom these census figures as a base, estimates have been made for\r\nlater years. The Secretary of Agriculture, or, speaking more\r\naccurately, a clerk in the Statistical Bureau of the Department of\r\nAgriculture, says the poultry and egg crop for 1907 was over\r\n$600,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe best two sources of information known to the writer by which\r\nthis estimate may be checked are the receipts of the New York market\r\nand the annual \"Value of Poultry and Eggs Sold,\" as given by the\r\nKansas State Board of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate I. Page 14. Graph - Is There Money in Poultry?]\r\n\r\nIn plate I the top curve a-a gives the average spring price of\r\nWestern first eggs in the New York market. The curve b-b gives the\r\nannual receipts of eggs at New York in millions of cases. Now, since\r\nvalue equals quantity multiplied by price, and since the quantity\r\nand values of poultry are closely correlated to those of eggs, the\r\nproduct of these two figures is a fair means of showing the rate of\r\nincrease in the value of the poultry crop. Starting with the census\r\nvalue of $291,000,000 for the year 1899, we thus find that by 1907\r\nthe amount is very close to $700,000,000. This is represented by the\r\nlower line.\r\n\r\nThe value of the poultry and eggs sold in Kansas have increased as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Year        Value\r\n\r\n    1903      $ 6,498,856\r\n    1904        7,551,871\r\n    1905        8,541,153\r\n    1906        9,085,896\r\n    1907       10,300,082\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dotted line e-e represents the increase in the national poultry\r\nand egg crop estimated from the Kansas figures. Evidently the\r\nestimate given in Secretary Wilson's report was not excessive.\r\n\r\nNow, I want to call the reader's attention to some relations about\r\nwhich there can be no doubt and which are even more significant. The\r\nstraight line c-c in Plate 1 represents the rate of increase of\r\npopulation in this country. The line b-b represents the rate of\r\nincrease in egg receipts at New York. As the country data backs up\r\nthe New York figures, the conclusion is inevitable that the\r\nproduction of poultry and eggs is increasing much more rapidly than\r\nis our population.\r\n\r\n\"Over-production,\" I hear the pessimist cry, but unfortunately for\r\nFriend Pessimist, we have a gauge on the over-production idea that\r\nlays all fears to rest. When the supply of any commodity increases\r\nfaster than the demand, we have over-production and falling prices.\r\nVice-versa, under-production is shown by a rising price. That prices\r\nof poultry and eggs have risen and risen rapidly, has already been\r\nshown.\r\n\r\n\"But prices of all products have risen,\" says one. Very true, but by\r\nstatistics with which I will not burden the reader, I find that\r\nprices of poultry products have risen more rapidly than the average\r\nrise in values of all commodities. This shows that poultry products\r\nare really more in demand and more valuable, not apparently so.\r\nMoreover, the rise in the price of poultry products has been much\r\nmore pronounced than the average rise in the price of all food\r\nproducts, which proves the growing demand for poultry and eggs to be\r\na real growing demand, not a turning to poultry products because of\r\nthe high price of other foods, as is sometimes stated.\r\n\r\n\r\nLess Ham and More Eggs.\r\n\r\nCertainly we, as a nation, are rapidly becoming eaters of hens and\r\nof hen fruit. Reasons are not hard to find. Poultry and eggs are the\r\nmost palatable, most wholesome, most convenient of foods. Our\r\ndemands for the products of the poultry yard grows because we are\r\nlearning to like them, and because our prosperity has grown and we\r\ncan afford them.\r\n\r\nAnother reason that the consumption of eggs is growing is because\r\nthe condition in which they reach the consumer is improving. The\r\nwriter may say some pretty hard things in this work about the\r\ncondition of poultry and eggs as they are now marketed, but any\r\nold-timer in the business will tell you stories of things as they\r\nused to be that will easily explain why our fathers ate more ham and\r\nless eggs.\r\n\r\nYet another reason why the per capita consumption of hens as\r\nmeasured in pounds or dollars increases, is that the hen herself has\r\nincreased in size; whereas John when he was Johnnie ate a two-ounce\r\ndrumstick, now Johnnie eats an analogous piece that weighs three\r\nounces. Perhaps, also, we have a growing respect for the law of\r\nMoses, or may be vegetarians who think that eggs grow on egg plants\r\nare becoming more numerous.\r\n\r\nOur consumption of pork per capita has, in the last half century,\r\ndiminished by half, our consumption of beef has remained stationary,\r\nbut our consumption of poultry and eggs has doubled itself, we know\r\nnot how many times, for a half century ago the ancestor of the\r\nindustrious hen of this age serenely scratched up grandmother's\r\ngeraniums and was unmolested by the statisticians.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Gets the Hen Money?\r\n\r\nSeven hundred millions of dollars is a lot of money. Who gets it?\r\nThere are no Rockefellers or Armours in the hen business. It is the\r\npeople's business. Why? Because the nature of the business is such\r\nthat it cannot be centralized. Land and intelligent labor, prompted\r\nby the spirit of ownership, is necessary to succeed in the hen\r\nbusiness. Land the captains of industry have not monopolized, and\r\nlabor imbued with the spirit of ownership they cannot monopolize.\r\nThe chicken business is, in dollars, one of the biggest industries\r\nin the country. In numbers of those engaged in it, the chicken\r\nbusiness is the biggest industry in the world--I bar none. Why is\r\nthis true? Primarily because the hen is a natural part of the\r\nequipment of every farm and of many village homes as well. It is\r\nthese millions of small flocks that count up in dollars and men and\r\ngive such an immense aggregate.\r\n\r\nMore than ninety-eight per cent. of the poultry and eggs of the\r\ncountry are produced on the general farm. The remaining one or two\r\nper cent. are produced on farms or plants where chicken culture is\r\nthe cash crop or chief business of the farmer. It is this business,\r\nrelatively small, though actually a matter of millions, that is\r\ncommonly spoken of as the poultry business, and about which our\r\nchief interest centers. A farmer can disregard all knowledge and all\r\nprogress and still keep chickens, but the man who has no other means\r\nof a livelihood must produce chicken products efficiently, or fail\r\naltogether--hence the greater interest in this portion of the\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nThe poultry business as a business to occupy a man's time and earn\r\nhim a livelihood, is a thing of recent origin and was little heard\r\nof before 1890. Since that time it has undergone a somewhat painful,\r\nthough steady growth. Many people have lost money in the business\r\nand have given it up in disgust, but on a whole the business has\r\nprogressed wonderfully, and now shows features of development that\r\nare clearly beyond the experimental stage and are undoubtedly here\r\nto stay.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion has been made by those who have failed or have seen\r\nothers fail in the poultry business, that success was impossible\r\nbecause of the destructive competition of the farmer, whose expense\r\nof production is small. Herein lies a great truth and a great error.\r\nThe farmer's cost of production is small, much smaller than that on\r\nmost of the book-made poultry farms--but the inference that the\r\npoultryman's cost of production cannot be lowered below that of the\r\nfarmer is a different statement.\r\n\r\nThe farm of our grandfather was a very diversified institution. It\r\ncontained in miniature a woolen mill, a packing house, a cheese\r\nfactory, perhaps a shoe factory and a blacksmith shop. One by one\r\nthese industries have been withdrawn from general farm-life, and\r\nestablished as independent businesses. Likewise our dairy farms, our\r\nfruit farms, and our market gardens have been segregated from the\r\ngeneral farm. This simply means that manufacturing cloth, or cheese,\r\nor producing milk, or tomatoes can be done at less cost in separate\r\nestablishments than upon a general farm.\r\n\r\nThe general farm will always grow poultry for home consumption, and\r\nwill always have some surplus to sell. With the surplus, the\r\npoultryman must compete. His only hope of successful competition is\r\nproduction at lower cost. Can this be done? It is being done, and\r\nthe numbers of people who are doing it are increasing, but they\r\nspend little money at poultry shows, or with the advertisers of\r\npoultry papers, and hence are little heard of in the poultry world.\r\n\r\nThe people whose names and faces are in the poultry papers are\r\nfrequently there only while their money lasts. They write long\r\narticles and show pictures of many houses and yards to prove that\r\nthere is money in the poultry business, but if one should keep their\r\nnames and put the question to them five years hence, a great many\r\ncould say, \"Yes, there is money in the poultry business; mine is in\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nSuch people and such plants do not get the cost of production down\r\nbelow the farmer's level. Between these two classes of poultry\r\nplants, the writer hopes in this work to show the distinction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nWHAT BRANCH OF THE POULTRY BUSINESS?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chicken business is especially prone to failure from a disregard\r\nof the common essential relation of cost and selling price necessary\r\nto the success of any business. That this should be more true of the\r\npoultry business than of any other undertakings is to be explained\r\nby the facts that as a business, it is new, that many of those who\r\nengage in it are inexperienced, but most particularly because\r\npractically all the literature published on the subject has been\r\nwritten by or written in the interest of those who had something to\r\nsell to the poultryman. As a result the figures of production are\r\ngenerally given higher than the facts warrant. The investor, be he\r\never so shrewd a man, builds upon these promises and when he finds\r\nhis production lower, is caught with an excessive investment and a\r\ncomplicated system on his hands, which make all profits impossible\r\nand which cannot readily be adapted to the new conditions.\r\n\r\nEstimates of poultry profits are quite common, but there are few\r\npublished figures showing the results that are actually obtained\r\nunder practical working conditions. In this volume I will try to\r\ngive the facts of what is being and can be actually accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious Poultry Products.\r\n\r\nIn considering the poultry industry we must first get some idea of\r\nthe various articles produced for sale.\r\n\r\nIt is common knowledge that the large meat packer can undersell the\r\nsmall packer because the by-products, such as bristles, which are\r\nwasted by the local killer, are a source of income to the large\r\npacker. Now, this does not infer that the small packer is shiftless\r\nand neglects to save his bristles, but that on the scale on which he\r\noperates it would cost him more to save the bristles than he could\r\nrealize on them.\r\n\r\nSo it is with poultry farming. For illustration: A visionary writer\r\nin a leading poultry paper, not long ago, advised poultrymen to\r\nstore eggs. In reality this would be the height of folly, unless the\r\npoultryman had his own retail store. In the first place profit on\r\ncold storage eggs, when all expenses are paid, will not average a\r\nhalf a cent a dozen; in the second place, the small lot would be\r\nrelatively troublesome and expensive to handle, and in the third\r\nplace, small lots of cold storage eggs are looked upon with\r\nsuspicion and do not find ready sale. So we see that cold storage\r\neggs are not a suitable product for the small poultryman to handle.\r\n\r\nA second illustration of an ill-chosen combination might be taken in\r\nthe case of a duck farmer who attempts to produce broilers. The\r\nprincipal difficulty of the duck business is that of getting\r\nsufficient intelligent labor in the rush season. The chief expense\r\nof investment is for incubators and brooder houses. If the duck\r\nfarmer now tries to add broilers, he will find that the labor comes\r\nat the same time of the year, that the chief equipment required is\r\nthat which is already crowded by the duck business, and that of the\r\nmen who have succeeded moderately well in caring for ducks will fail\r\naltogether with the young chicks, which do not thrive under the same\r\nmachine-like methods.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, let us take the example of an egg farm man who\r\nhas resolved to combine his attention wholly to the production of\r\nmarket eggs. He succeeds well in his work and is visited by the\r\npoultry editors. His picture, the picture of his chickens and of his\r\nchicken houses, are printed in the poultry papers. For a reasonable\r\nsum invested in advertising and in exhibition at the shows, this man\r\ncould now double his income by going into the breeding stock\r\nbusiness. To refuse to spread out in this case would certainly be\r\nfoolish.\r\n\r\nThe following classification of the sales products of the poultry\r\nindustry is given as a basis for farther consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n            CHICKENS.\r\n\r\nFor food purposes:\r\n\r\n    Eggs.\r\n    Hens, after laying has been finished.\r\n    Cockerels, necessarily hatched in hatching pullets for layers.\r\n        (Sold as squab broilers, regular broilers, springs,\r\n         roasters or capons.)\r\n    Both sexes as squab broilers, broilers or roasters.\r\n\r\nFor stock purposes:\r\n    Eggs for hatching.\r\n    Day-old chicks.\r\n    Mature fowls.\r\n\r\n\r\n            DUCKS.\r\n\r\nFor table--green or spring ducks.\r\n    By-products, old ducks and duck feathers.\r\n\r\nFor breeding-stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n            GEESE.\r\n\r\n   Food,    Feathers,    Breeders.\r\n\r\n\r\n            TURKEYS.\r\n\r\n      Food,        Breeders.\r\n\r\n\r\n            PIGEONS.\r\n\r\n      Squabs,    Breeding Stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n            GUINEAS.\r\n\r\n     Broilers,      Mature Fowls.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will now discuss these products more in detail. Poultry, other\r\nthan chickens, I do not care to discuss at length, because it is not\r\nfor the purpose of the book, and because the demand for other kinds\r\nof poultry is limited and the chance for the growth of the business\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duck Business.\r\n\r\nThe duck business is the most highly commercialized at the present\r\ntime of any branch of the poultry business. The duck is the oldest\r\ndomestic bird and was hatched by artificial incubation in China,\r\nwhen our ancestors were gnawing raw bones in the caves of Europe.\r\nThe duck is the most domestic of birds and will thrive under more\r\nmachine-like methods and without that touch of nature and of the\r\nowner's kindly interest so necessary to the welfare of the fowls of\r\nthe gallinaceous order. The green duck business is about twenty\r\nyears old and has become an established business in every sense of\r\nthe word. The largest plants now produce about one hundred thousand\r\nducks per annum. The profits at present are not large even for the\r\nmost successful plants, because the demand is limited and the\r\nproduction has reached such a point that cost of production and\r\nselling price bear a definite relation as in all established\r\nbusinesses. The green duck business is not an easy one for the\r\nnovice because the margin between cost (chiefly food cost) and\r\nselling price is low, and unless the new man can reduce the cost of\r\nproduction or raise his selling price in some way, he will have no\r\nadvantage over the old and successful firms.\r\n\r\n\r\nSquab Business Overdone.\r\n\r\nThe business of producing pigeon squabs resembles the duck business\r\nin the sense that it has been reduced to a successful system. The\r\nproduction of squabs has grown until the demand is satisfied and the\r\nprice has fallen to just that figure that will continue to bring in\r\na sufficient number of squabs from the plants which are already\r\nestablished, or which continue to be established by those who do not\r\nstop to investigate the relation between the cost of production and\r\nthe prevailing prices.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurkeys Not a Commercial Success.\r\n\r\nIn the case of turkeys, we find exactly opposite conditions. The\r\nprice of turkeys has risen with the price of chickens and eggs,\r\nuntil one would think that there would be great money in the\r\nbusiness, and there is, for the motherly farm wife who has the knack\r\nof bringing the little turks through the danger of delicate\r\nbabyhood. But just as the duck is more domesticated than the\r\nchicken, so the turkey, which yet closely resembles its wild\r\nancestor, is less domestic and has as yet failed to surrender to the\r\nways of commercial reasoning, the chief factor of which is\r\nartificial brooding.\r\n\r\nThe presence of a disease called blackhead has done vast injury to\r\nthe turkey industry in the northeastern section of the country. In\r\nthe South the industry has been booming. Especially in Tennessee and\r\nTexas, I found great local pride in the turkey crop. I certainly\r\nwould advise any farm wife, in sections where blackhead does not\r\nprevail, to try her hand at turkey raising. As to her advisability\r\nof continuance in the business, the number of turkeys at the end of\r\nthe season will be the best judge.\r\n\r\n\r\nGuinea Growing a New Venture.\r\n\r\nThe guinea growing business is the newest of the poultry industries.\r\nIn fact, it may be said of guineas, as of our grandmother's\r\ntomatoes, \"Folks had them around without knowing they were of any\r\nuse.\" The new use for guineas is as a substitute for game. Guinea\r\nbroilers make quail-on-toast and older ones are good for grouse,\r\nprairie chicken or pheasant. The retail price in the large cities\r\nruns as high as $1.50 to $2.00 a pair. It will probably not pay to\r\nraise them unless one is sure of receiving as much as 50 cents each.\r\nAs for the rearing of guineas, they may be considered on a parallel\r\ncase with turkeys, if anything they are even more difficult to raise\r\nin large quantities. I would also advise this additional precaution:\r\nLook up the market in the locality before attempting guinea rearing.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeese--the Fame of Watertown.\r\n\r\nAs for the goose business, the writer must admit that he doesn't\r\nknow much about it. In fact, the most of my knowledge concerning\r\nthis business was acquired by a visit to Watertown, Wis., which is\r\nthe center of the noodled goose industry\r\n\r\nThe Watertown geese are fed by hand every two hours day and night.\r\nThey sell to the Hebrew trade at as much per pound as the goose\r\nweighs, and have brought as high as $14.00 apiece. All of this is\r\ninteresting, but I hold that the reader who is willing to take\r\ninstruction will do better to be guided toward those branches of the\r\npoultry industry for the products of which there is a great and\r\nincreasing demand. So we will leave the goose and guinea business to\r\nthe venturesome spirits and consider the various branches of the\r\nchicken industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ill-omened Broiler Business.\r\n\r\nThe broiler business stands to-day as the ill-omened valley in the\r\npoultry landscape. As a rule broiler production has not and probably\r\nwill not pay. I know of a few exceptions--about enough to prove the\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nMost poultry writers, when they make the statement that broilers do\r\nnot pay, insert the phrase \"As an exclusive business\" after the word\r\nbroilers. This is merely a ruse to take the rough edge off an\r\nunpleasant statement, for it certainly hurts the poultry editor to\r\nadmit that a much exploited branch of the industry is a failure.\r\nNevertheless it is a failure and the more frankly we admit the fact,\r\nthe less good capital and good brains will be wasted in the attempt\r\nto produce at a profit something which is, and probably always will\r\nbe, produced at a loss.\r\n\r\nThe reason the broiler is produced at a loss is that 95 per cent. of\r\nthe broilers produced are a by-product of egg, fancy and general\r\npoultry production, and as such their selling price is not\r\ndetermined by the cost of production, or the supply determined by\r\nthe demand. That the broiler business received the boom that it did,\r\nis due to plain ignorance of the cost of production, or to the\r\nappreciation that the ability to rear young chicks could find a more\r\nprofitable outlet than in broiler production. Let us take an\r\nanalogous case. Suppose a city man should discover the fact that\r\nthere was a demand for dried casein from skim milk. With pencil and\r\npaper he could easily figure profits in the business. If this\r\ndreamer would attempt to keep cows for the production of casein and\r\nthrow away his butter fat, we would have an analogous case to the\r\nbroiler raiser who does not keep his pullets for egg production.\r\n\r\nThe young cockerel, like skim milk, is a by-product and may pay over\r\nthe cost of feeding, or some other specific item, but that he does\r\nnot pay the whole cost, including wages for the manager is proven by\r\ntwo facts: First, every large broiler plant yet started has either\r\nfailed flatly or shifted its main line to other things; second, egg\r\nfarmers would be only too glad to buy pullets at the price for which\r\nthey sell the cockerels--a confession that it costs more to produce\r\nbroilers than they will bring.\r\n\r\nThe conception of the broiler business when it was boomed twenty\r\nyears ago was to produce broilers in early spring, when other folks\r\nhad none. It was, like the early watermelon, or the early strawberry\r\nbusiness--to make its profits in extreme prices.\r\n\r\nThis idea received several severe blows from the hands of modern\r\nprogress. One is the development of poultry fattening and crate\r\nfeeding in this country. This has resulted in supplying the consumer\r\nwith choice chicken-flesh that can be produced more economically\r\nthan broilers. Formerly it was a case of eating old hen--rooster,\r\nage unknown, or broilers--now we have capon, roaster, crate-fattened\r\nchickens and green ducks, all rivals for the place formerly occupied\r\nexclusively by the broiler.\r\n\r\nAgain, the improvement of shipping and dressing facilities, the\r\nuniversal introduction of the refrigerator car and the introduction\r\ninto the central west of the American breeds, has flooded the\r\neastern market with a large amount of spring chickens--by-products\r\nof the egg business on the farm--which are almost equal in quality\r\nto the down-eastern product.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent reason of the lessened profit in broilers is the\r\ndevelopment of the cold storage industry. Cold storage destroys the\r\nelement of season, and allows only that margin of profit that the\r\nconsumer is willing to pay for a fresh killed broiler from a Jersey\r\nbroiler plant, as compared with last summer's product from the Iowa\r\nfarms. From a summer copy of Farm Poultry, I quote the Boston\r\nmarket:\r\n\r\n    Fresh killed Northern and Eastern:\r\n        Fowls,   choice               15c\r\n        Broilers, choice to fancy  23-25c\r\n    Western, ice packed:\r\n        Fowls,   choice               14c\r\n        Broilers, choice           20-22c\r\n\r\n    Western frozen:\r\n           Fowls, choice.................   14c\r\n           Broilers, choice..............18-20c\r\n    Eggs:\r\n           Nearly fancy..................   26c\r\n           Western choice........17-1/2-18-1/2c\r\n\r\nTo complete our comparison I turn to the previous winter and find\r\nthat the best storage eggs are quoted at 19c, when the best fresh\r\nare selling at 35c. This was a poor storage season and a quotation\r\nof 22c and 25c would perhaps be a fairer comparative figure. We find\r\nthe per cent, of premium on the local product to be:\r\n\r\n    Fowls, local over fresh western........... 7 per cent.\r\n    Fowls, local over frozen western.......... 7 per cent.\r\n    Broilers, local over fresh western........14 per cent.\r\n    Broilers, local over frozen western.......26 per cent.\r\n    Eggs, local over fresh western............30 per cent.\r\n    Eggs, local over storage western..........37 per cent.\r\n\r\nI consider these general facts concerning the failure of broiler\r\nproduction, and the logical explanations given, as far more\r\nconvincing than any figures I could give concerning the detailed\r\ncost of production. Nor am I capable of giving as accurate figures\r\nas I can in the case of poultry keeping for egg production, for I\r\nhave had neither the desire nor the opportunity to look them up. The\r\nfollowing suggestive analysis I submit for the purpose of pointing\r\nout why the cost of production is too great to allow a profit. We\r\nmay consider the chick marketing as May, the weight as 1-1/4, and\r\nthe price as 35 cents a pound, or, putting it roundly a price of 50\r\ncents a bird.\r\n\r\nNow, May broilers mean February eggs. If the reader will refer to\r\nthe tables of hatchability and mortality he will see that for our\r\nnorthern states this is one of the worst seasons for hatching. A\r\nhatchability of 40 per cent, times a liveability of 50 per cent,\r\ngives a net liveability of 20 per cent. Now, anyone with the ability\r\nto produce high grade eggs at that time a year, could get about 40c\r\na dozen for them, which raises the egg cost per broiler to about 17\r\ncents. The feed cost per broiler is small, usually estimated at 12\r\ncents, and this makes a cost of 29 cents. Now, let us allow a cent\r\nfor expense of selling charges and forget all about investment, fuel\r\nand incidentals, we have left a margin of 20 cents.\r\n\r\nBefore going farther let us look at the labor bill. Suppose it is a\r\none-man plant. Suppose the owner sets a value on his services of\r\n$1,200 per annum. That is pretty good, but few men who set a lower\r\nvalue on their services will have accumulated enough capital to go\r\ninto the business. At 20 cents each it will take 6,000 broilers to\r\nmake $1,200. That will take 30,000 eggs and at three settings will\r\nrequire 40 240-egg incubators, which, of a good make, will cost\r\n$1,260. To spread the hatching out over a longer period is to run\r\ninto cheap prices on the one hand, or a still impossible egg season\r\non the other. It will take upwards of a hundred brooders to house\r\nthe chicks.\r\n\r\nThere is no use of going farther till we have solved these\r\ndifficulties. First we have more work than one man can do; second,\r\nwe require a number of hatchable eggs that cannot be bought in\r\nwinter without a campaign of advertising and canvassing for them,\r\nthat would make them cost double our previous figure. To produce\r\nthem oneself would require a flock of 2,500 hens. When a man gets to\r\nthat point in the business he is out of the broiler business and an\r\negg farmer, and will do the same thing, hatch the chicks when eggs\r\nare cheap and fertile, selling his surplus cockerels for 25 cents\r\neach and permit the storage man to freeze them until the following\r\nspring to compete with the broiler man's expensively produced goods.\r\n\r\nThe effort at early broiler production was a natural result of the\r\ncombination of the idea of artificial incubation with our\r\ngrandmother's pride in having the first setting hen. But in the\r\npresent age the man who attempts it is rowing against the current of\r\neconomical production, for the cheaply produced broiler can be\r\nstored until the season of scarcity, with but slight loss in\r\nquality. To produce broilers in the season of scarcity, necessitates\r\nthe consumption of a product (eggs) which cannot be so successfully\r\nstored, with a lesser quantity of that same product in its season of\r\nplenty. We will give the production of broilers no further attention\r\nsave as a by-product of egg production.\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth Shore Roaster.\r\n\r\nThe production of South Shore soft roasters in a local section of\r\nMassachusetts, offers a successful contrast with the broiler\r\nbusiness and is, so far as the writer knows, the only case in the\r\nUnited States where pullets are profitably diverted from egg\r\nproduction. The process of roaster production is essentially as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe incubators are set in the fall or early winter, and the chicks\r\nreared in brooder houses. As soon as the tender age is past, the\r\nchickens are put in simple colony houses where, with hopper fed\r\ncorn, beef scrap and rye on the range, they grow throughout the\r\nwinter and spring. They are sold from May 1st to July 1st and bring\r\nsuch prices that the cockerels are caponized yet not sold as capons,\r\nshowing them to be the highest priced chicken flesh in the market\r\nsave small broilers. Now, the income of roasters is two to five\r\ntimes as much per head as that of broilers. The added expense is\r\nonly a matter of feed, which bears about the same ratio to weight as\r\nwith broilers. The great advantage of the roaster business over that\r\nof the broiler business comes in the following points:\r\n\r\n1st: The initial expense of eggs, incubation and brooding are\r\ndistributed over a much larger final valuation.\r\n\r\n2nd: The incubation period, while perhaps in as difficult a\r\nseason, can be distributed over a longer period of time.\r\n\r\nWith 8 pound roasters at 30 cents, we have an expense account about\r\nas follows: cost of production to broiler stage, 30 cents as\r\npreviously given. An additional food cost of 10 cents per pound of\r\nchicken flesh would still leave a margin of $1.40, so, for an income\r\nof $1,200, only about 860 birds need be raised, a proposition not\r\nbeyond the capacity of one man to handle.\r\n\r\nAllowing a spread of five hatching periods, the number of eggs\r\nrequired at once would be one-twelfth that demanded by the broiler\r\nfarm. As it is, the roaster grower finds trouble in getting good\r\neggs and is obliged to pay 50 cents a dozen for them, but his want\r\nis within the region of possibility.\r\n\r\nThe South Shore roaster district is an example of an industry built\r\nup by specialization and co-operation. But in this sense I do not\r\nmean co-operation in production, but that the product is handled by\r\na few dealers and has become well known so that the brand sells\r\nreadily at an advanced price. To a beginner in the South Shore\r\ndistrict, the numerous successes and failures around him cannot help\r\nbut be of great benefit. The South Shore roaster district of\r\nMassachusetts is the best example of specialized community\r\nproduction of poultry flesh that we have in the United States. It is\r\nonly rivaled by the districts in the south of England and in France.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter III the writer takes up fully the community production of\r\neggs. The reason I have gone into this matter in regard to eggs\r\nrather than roasters, is because the egg production is much the\r\ngreater industry, and, whereas the soft roaster is at a premium only\r\nin a few Boston shops, high grade eggs are universally recognized\r\nand in demand. Many of the economies, especially concerning\r\nincubation, would apply equally well in both communities. I expect\r\nto see the time when chicken flesh shall be produced with these more\r\nadvanced methods in many \"South Shore\" communities.\r\n\r\n\r\nToo Much Competition in Fancy Poultry.\r\n\r\nThe various types of chicken farming are classified by what is made\r\nthe leading sales product. This will depend wholly upon what is done\r\nwith the female chicks that are hatched. If they are sold as\r\nbroilers it is a broiler plant; if as roasters, it is a roaster\r\nplant; if as stock, it is a fancy or breeding stock business, but if\r\nkept for laying the proposition is an egg farm, and all other\r\nproducts are by-products. These by-products are to be carefully\r\nconsidered, and sold at the greatest possible price, but their\r\nproduction is incidental to the production of the main crop.\r\n\r\nOf the fancy poultry business as a main issue it must be said that\r\nit is certainly a poor policy to start out to make a living doing\r\nwhat hundreds of other people are only too glad to spend money in\r\ndoing. Just as a homeless girl in a great city is beaten out in the\r\nstruggle for existence by competition with girls who have good\r\nhomes, and are working for chocolate money, so the man starting out\r\nas a poultry fancier is certainly working at great odds in\r\ncompetition with the professional men, farmers and poultry raisers\r\nwhose income from fancy stock is meant to buy Christmas presents and\r\nnot to pay grocery bills.\r\n\r\nTo enter the fancy poultry business, one should take up poultry\r\nbreeding in a small way, while working at another occupation, or he\r\nmay take up commercial poultry production, learn to produce stock in\r\nlarge quantities and at a low productive cost, after which any\r\nbreeding stock business he may secure will be added profit. The\r\nfancier will find the cost of production as given for commercial\r\npurposes very instructive, but if he operates in a small way he\r\nshould expect to find his productive costs increased unless he\r\nchooses to count his own labor as of little or no value. That every\r\nchicken fancier also has in a small way commercial products to sell,\r\ngoes without saying. These, indeed, together with his sales of\r\nhigh-priced stock, may pull him through with a total profit, even\r\nthough his production cost is great, but every fancier should take a\r\npride in making the sales at commercial rates pay for their cost of\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nIf the reader has received the impression from the present\r\ndiscussion that fancy poultry breeding always proves unprofitable,\r\nhe certainly has failed to get the key-note of the situation. There\r\nare numbers of fancy poultry breeders making incomes of several\r\nthousand dollars per year, but these are old breeders and well-known\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThere is another type of poultry fancier who is more commercial in\r\nhis methods, but whose work lacks the personal enthusiasm and\r\nartistic touch of the regular fancier. I refer to the band wagon\r\nstyle of breeder who gets out a general catalog in which are\r\npictured acres of poultry yards with fences as straight as the\r\ndraughtsman's rule can make them. Such men do a big business. They\r\nmay carry a part or all of the breeding stock on a central poultry\r\nplant and farm out the eggs, contracting to buy back the stock in\r\nthe fall, or the poultry farm may be a myth and the manager may\r\nsimply sell the product of the neighboring farmers who raise it\r\nunder contract.\r\n\r\nThe system is naturally disliked by the higher class fanciers, but\r\nthe writer must confess that any system which gets improved stock\r\ndistributed among the farmers is worthy of praise. These types of\r\npoultry farms have been more largely carried on in the West than in\r\nthe East, owing to the fact that true fanciers are thicker in the\r\nEast. There is undoubtedly still plenty of room for band wagon\r\npoultry plants in the West and especially in the South.\r\n\r\nAs adjuncts of this business may be mentioned the sale of a line of\r\npoultry supplies and the handling of other pet stock, such as dogs\r\nor Shetland ponies. In this case the advantage of such additions\r\ndepends upon the fact that the greatest cost is that of advertising,\r\nand, if anything that will be associated in the buyer's mind with\r\nthe main article be added to the catalog, it will result in\r\nadditional sales at a low rate of advertising cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nEgg Farming the Most Certain and Profitable.\r\n\r\nWe have now discussed all the branches of the poultry business save\r\nthat of egg production, and the result of our review indicates that\r\nmost of these fields are either of limited opportunities or that\r\nthey present obstacles in the very nature of the work that prevent\r\ntheir being conducted on a large scale.\r\n\r\nEgg production is undoubtedly the most promising and profitable\r\nbranch of the poultry industries. The chief reason that this is true\r\nis to be found in the fact that the most difficult feature in\r\nchicken growing is the rearing of young stock through the brooding\r\nperiod. Now, as the eggs laid by a hen are worth several times the\r\nvalue of her carcass, it stands to reason that once we succeed in\r\nrearing pullets, egg farming must be the most profitable business to\r\nengage in.\r\n\r\nFor each hen that passes through a laying period there is her own\r\ncarcass, and at least one cockerel, that are necessarily produced\r\nand that must be marketed. Now, the pullet is worth more for egg\r\nproducing than can be realized for her as a broiler or roaster, and\r\nher extra worth may be considered as counter-balancing the price at\r\nwhich cockerels must be sold.\r\n\r\nThe egg crop represents about two-thirds of the value of all poultry\r\nproducts, and the demand for the high grade goods has never been\r\nsatisfied. Egg farming cannot easily be overdone, whereas any other\r\ntype of poultry production must compete with the cockerels and hens\r\nthat are a by-product of egg farming.\r\n\r\nEgg farming by no means relieves one from the difficulties of\r\nincubation and growing young stock, but it does throw these\r\ndifficult parts of the business at the natural season of the year\r\nand results in a distribution of work throughout a longer period of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIn the remainder of the volume we will consider the poultryman as an\r\negg farmer. We will also, unless otherwise stated, assume that he is\r\na White Leghorn egg farmer, who is hatching by artificial\r\nincubation. Such reference to the marketing of poultry flesh or to\r\nother breeds will be made only in comparison of this type of the\r\nbusiness or in relation to the production or handling of farm-grown\r\npoultry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE POULTRY PRODUCING COMMUNITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe builder of air castles in Poultrydom invariably starts out with\r\na resumÃ© of the specialization of the world's work and the wonderful\r\nadvances in the economy of production of the large corporate\r\norganization, compared with the individual producer.\r\n\r\nThe lone blacksmith hammering out a horseshoe nail is contrasted\r\nwith the mills of the American Steel Company. The fond dreamer looks\r\nupon the steel trust, the oil trust, the department store, the\r\npacking house, the chain groceries, the theatrical trust, and the\r\ncolossal enterprises that dominate every field of industry save\r\nagriculture. Here, then, lies the neglected opportunity for the\r\nindustrial dreamer to hop over the fence, awaken the sleeping\r\nfarmer, and fill his own purse with the wealth to be made by\r\napplying modern business methods to agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe knowing smile--the farmer may be asleep and he may not be.\r\nSuppose that he is, does the fond dreamer dream that he is the first\r\nman from the industrial kingdom of great things to look with hungry\r\neyes at the rich field of agricultural opportunity, basking in last\r\ncentury's sun? Alas, fond dreamer, your name is legion. Every farmer\r\nwho has sent a son to college has known you and the Hon. William\r\nJennings Bryan has met you, called you an agriculturist and defined\r\nyou as a man who makes his money in town and spends it in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nBut the dreamer is right in his first premise--great economies in\r\nproduction are the result of specialization and combination. Why not\r\nthen in agriculture? I'll tell you why. There is a touch of nature\r\nin the living thing that calls for a closer interest on the part of\r\nthe laborer than the industrial system of the mine and factory can\r\ngive.\r\n\r\nWhy is combined and specialized production more economical? It may\r\nbe because it gets more efficient work out of labor, it may be that\r\nlarger operations make feasible the employment of more efficient\r\nmethods and machinery. The cost of production may be lowered, by\r\neither or both of these means, or it may be lowered by an increased\r\nefficiency in machinery, even with a decreased efficiency in labor.\r\n\r\nCombination and specialization so commonly cut down expenses because\r\nof large operations and the use of better tools, that we may take\r\nthis saving for granted. When it comes to labor there is a different\r\nstory. The negro working with boss and gang, or the machine-tender\r\nin the factory work as well or better for large than for small\r\nconcerns, but the labor of a poultry plant is different. It is made\r\nup of a great many different operations well scattered in space and\r\ntime. For the most part it is simple labor, but it is essential that\r\nit be performed with reasonable concern for the welfare of the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nIn other industries, as with men working at a bench, the presence of\r\na foreman keeps them busy and their work may be daily inspected. To\r\nhave foremen in poultry work would require as many foremen as\r\nlaborers, and even then they would be as useless, for when the last\r\nround of the brooders is made at night a foreman standing three feet\r\naway could not know whether the laborer who had placed his hand in\r\nthe brooder had found all well or all wrong.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to carry the argument farther. The labor bill is one\r\nof the biggest items of expense in poultry production. With a system\r\nwhere the efficiency of the labor decreases with the size of the\r\nbusiness, large industrial enterprises are impossible. Such savings\r\nas will be made in buying supplies, selling, etc., will be wasted in\r\nthe reduced efficiency of labor.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of labor in poultry work must be self-reliant labor and the\r\nonly test for such efficiency is number of chicks reared and the\r\nweight of the egg basket. Even this will not be a complete test\r\nunless from the income be subtracted the feed bills.\r\n\r\nA system of renting or working on shares that will gain the\r\nadvantages of centralization without losing the individual interest\r\nof the laborer, will go a long way toward making the poultry\r\nbusiness one wherein large capital and large brains can find a place\r\nto work. I expect to see in the future some such system evolved. In\r\nfact we have to-day a profit-sharing plan between owner and foreman\r\non many of our best plants. To extend such to each laborer requires\r\nmore system and better superintendence, but it is feasible and must\r\ncome. But, better still is it for the worker to own the stock. Best\r\nyet if he owns both stock and land, leaving to larger capital only\r\nsuch phases of the business as involve great saving when done on a\r\nwholesale basis.\r\n\r\nJust as the manufacturer of farm machinery, the packing of meat and\r\nthe manufacture of butter have successfully been taken out of the\r\ncontrol of the individual farmer and placed under corporate or\r\nco-operative organization, so the writer expects to see certain\r\nportions of the process of poultry production removed from the hands\r\nof the farmer and controlled by more specialized and expert labor.\r\nFar from meaning the lessening of the earning power of the farmer,\r\nevery one of such steps means larger production and more profits.\r\nThe ideal of agricultural economics is to give the farmer the\r\nsmallest possible proportion of the work of agricultural production\r\nin order that the most may be produced and the farmer's share along\r\nwith the others may be largest.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstablished Poultry Communities.\r\n\r\nIn a previous chapter we spoke of the South Shore roaster district\r\nof Massachusetts. Here is a community where, in lots of from a dozen\r\nto four or five thousand, are annually produced seventy-five or one\r\nhundred thousand market fowls of one particular type. While this\r\nbusiness was not built up by the efforts of a corporation or\r\nindividual who planned definitely the entire project, yet we find a\r\ncentral influence at work in the person of the firm of Curtis Bros.,\r\nwho for years have bought the majority of South Shore roasters, and\r\nwho have done a great deal to advertise the product and encourage\r\ntheir neighbors to a larger and more uniform production.\r\n\r\nAt Little Compton, R. I., is a very similar parallel of the South\r\nShore district in the shape of egg farms. Here we find within a\r\nradius of two miles about one hundred thousand Rhode Island Red hens\r\nowned in flocks of two thousand or less. The methods used throughout\r\nthe community are all alike and are simple in the extreme. There are\r\nno incubators, no brooders, no poultry houses, no long houses, no\r\ndropping boards to be scraped every morning, nothing in fact, but\r\nboard-walled, board-roofed, colony houses, scattered over the grass\r\nfields and similar though smaller fields covered with coops for hens\r\nand chicks. Feeding is equally simple; a mash of meat, vegetables\r\nand ground grain mixed once a day and hauled around in a one-horse\r\ncart and hoppers of whole corn exposed in the houses. The houses are\r\ncleaned twice a year. Little Compton is, indeed, a community where\r\nall the rules of the poultry books are regularly violated, and yet a\r\nlarger number of successful egg farms can be seen from the church\r\nspire at Little Compton Corners than most poultry writers have ever\r\nseen or read about. Strange it is, as Josh Billings puts it, that\r\n\"some folks know things that ain't so.\"\r\n\r\nAn illustration published in a recent issue of the World's Work\r\ntells a remarkable story. A pile of egg shells as big as a straw\r\nstack certainly indicates \"something doing\" in the chicken business,\r\nand it is a very proud monument to Mr. Byce who, some twenty odd\r\nyears ago, established an incubator factory at the town of Petaluma.\r\nPetaluma is in Sonoma County, California, forty miles north of San\r\nFrancisco. In the census year of 1899, Sonoma County produced more\r\neggs than any other county in the United States. To-day there are in\r\nthe Petaluma region close to one million hens.\r\n\r\nLike the Little Compton district, Petaluma is a one-breed community,\r\nWhite Leghorns being the breed used. The individual flocks range\r\nlarger than at Little Compton, chiefly because the milder climate,\r\nsmaller breed, and establishment of the central hatchery enables one\r\nman to take care of more birds.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked Mr. Byce for a list of the people in his neighborhood\r\nkeeping over one thousand hens, he replied by sending me a list of\r\ntwenty-two men who keep from 8,000 down to 2,500 each, and said that\r\nto give those keeping from one to two thousand, would practically be\r\nto take a census of the county. The methods of housing and feeding\r\nused are simple and inexpensive like those at Little Compton.\r\n\r\nThe chief reason why Petaluma shows a more advanced development in\r\nthe poultry community than the eastern poultry growing localities,\r\nis to be found in the climatic advantages which favor incubation\r\n(see Chapter on Incubation) and the consequent development of the\r\ncentral hatchery. Outside of this, the location is not especially\r\nfavorable. The temperature is milder in the winter than in the East,\r\nbut the Petaluma winter is one of continual rain which develops roup\r\nto a greater extent than we have it in the East. The prices received\r\nfor high grade eggs in San Francisco is in the winter about equal to\r\nthe top prices in New York. In the spring and summer New York will\r\ngive more for fancy goods. The cost of corn on the Pacific Coast is\r\nabout 40 cents a hundred more than on the Atlantic Coast. Wheat,\r\nhowever, is cheaper than in the East, but not cheap enough to\r\nsubstitute for the more staple grain.\r\n\r\nThe eggs from the Petaluma region are at present marketed largely\r\nthrough a co-operative marketing association.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeveloping Poultry Communities.\r\n\r\nI have shown why the large individual poultry farms with hired labor\r\nhave not proven profitable fields for the investment of capital.\r\nAgain, I have shown that in a few localities where the business was\r\nincidentally started, communities of independent poultry farmers\r\nhave grown up which are very successful, and that there is no\r\napparent reason why similar communities elsewhere, if intelligently\r\nlocated, could not do as well or better.\r\n\r\nThis looks like an excellent field for corporate enterprise.\r\nCertainly there is no more reason why the poultry community cannot\r\nbe as successfully promoted as an irrigation project, or a cheese\r\nfactory, or a trucking community. In such a community there are many\r\nfunctions that can be better performed by a capitalized body managed\r\nby experts than by individual poultrymen acting alone.\r\n\r\nThese functions are:\r\n\r\nFirst, the selection of a location and the purchase of the land in\r\nlarge quantities.\r\n\r\nSecond, laying out this land into suitable individual holdings, with\r\nregard to economy of water supply and the collection of the product.\r\n\r\nThird, the partial or complete equipment of these farms at less\r\nexpense and in a more suitable manner than could or would be done by\r\nthe individual holders.\r\n\r\nFourth, the sale or rent of these places to poultrymen at a\r\nreasonable profit on the investment, but at a rate which will still\r\nbe below the cost at which the individual could have acquired the\r\nland. Fifth, the selection of the stock that would not only be\r\nbetter adapted to the enterprise than that which would be acquired\r\nby the individual farmer, but would possess the uniformity necessary\r\nto the maintenance of a standard grade in the product.\r\n\r\nSixth, the centralized hatching of the chicks by which means chicks\r\ncan be more cheaply hatched and better hatched than by the imperfect\r\nmethods available to the small poultryman.\r\n\r\nSeventh, the purchase of all outside supplies with the usual savings\r\ninvolved in large purchases.\r\n\r\nEighth, a teaming system of delivering such supplies.\r\n\r\nNinth, a general protection against thieves and predatory animals by\r\nan organized war on all \"varments.\"\r\n\r\nTenth, maintenance of the best methods in feeding and care by the\r\nemployment of skilled advisers, or the operation of demonstration\r\nfarms under the direction of the central management.\r\n\r\nEleventh, the enforced daily gathering of all eggs and their\r\nlodgment that same evening in a clean, dry cooler, with a\r\nthermometer hovering around 29 degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nTwelfth, the strict enforcement of penalties against the man who\r\nattempts to sell bad eggs.\r\n\r\nThirteenth, the prompt dispatch of the product to its final market.\r\n\r\nFourteenth, the final sale of the eggs with opportunities for fancy\r\nprices made possible by an absolutely guaranteed product in\r\nquantities sufficient to permit of a regular supply and of\r\nadvertising the product.\r\n\r\nFifteenth, the conduction of breeding operations along any desired\r\nline, with the opportunity of combining the principle of great\r\nnumbers for selection with the comparison of all progeny from\r\nancestry, a method that will bring results a hundred times more\r\nquickly than the efforts of the small breeder.\r\n\r\nSixteenth, the advantage of the sale of breeding stock to be\r\nacquired from the free publicity which is showered on all unique\r\nindustrial enterprises.\r\n\r\nIn these sixteen functions there is ample opportunity for capital,\r\nbacked by ability in organization, to reap an ample reward. Is it a\r\ndream? In a sense yes, but a dream made possible by the observation\r\nof the actual results achieved in similar lines, and of the present\r\ntendency in the poultry producing world.\r\n\r\nWhy has not this thing been done before? Because no one knew enough\r\nto do it. Why did not the wonderful trucking regions develop earlier\r\nin the South, and why does it still take northern settlers, backed\r\nby railroad advertising, to develop the wonderful modern industries\r\nwhich enables every city dweller in the North to have strawberries\r\nin February and fresh vegetables any day in the year?\r\n\r\nWhy did the California fruit trade develop? Did anyone suppose forty\r\nyears ago that the unsettled valley around Pasadena would ever\r\nproduce one thousand dollars per acre in one year? These orange\r\ngroves, too valuable for agricultural purposes to be used as town\r\nsites, were precarious experiments until the trans-continental\r\nrefrigerator car and the California Fruit Growers' Exchange paved\r\nthe way and put each day in every eastern and northern city just the\r\nquantity of oranges that the people could consume at a profitable\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nMr. Harwood, in the World's Work for May, 1908, after describing the\r\n\"City of a Million Hens,\" raises the question, \"If in Petaluma, why\r\nnot anywhere?\" I would like to answer that question by saying that\r\nwhile anywhere is a little broad, the reason the industry has not\r\ndeveloped elsewhere has been because of the diversion of interested\r\ncapital towards impractical large individual poultry plants, manned\r\nby hired labor. Another reason has been the lack of the technical\r\nknowledge necessary to construct and operate efficient hatcheries.\r\n\r\nThe poultryman has been a disciple of the poultry papers and poultry\r\nfanciers of the day. The poultry papers and poultry literature has\r\ngenerally been supported by poultry fanciers and manufacturers of\r\nincubators, patent nests and portable houses. The good folks have\r\nvied with one another in complicating the business. They have built\r\nsteam-piped houses, with padded walls and miniature railways with\r\nwhich daily to haul away the droppings. A few famous fanciers\r\nselling eggs at $10.00 per setting have made such business pay, but\r\nalas for the luckless investor in what the visiting poultry editor\r\nwould style a \"handsomely equipped modern poultry plant.\"\r\n\r\nA few years ago a Government poultry expert paid a visit to\r\nPetaluma. He came back and reported, \"It is a great disappointment,\r\nthe methods are very crude.\" The case is most pathetic. Here was a\r\nman employed by the people to teach them how to make poultry pay.\r\nHis carfare is paid across the continent that he might visit the\r\nonly community in the United States where at that time any\r\nconsiderable number of people were making their living from poultry,\r\nand because he did not find lightning rods on the poultry houses, he\r\ncame back with the look of Naamen who, when he was requested by\r\nElisha to bathe seven times in the river Jordan, replied, \"It is\r\nvery crude.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWill Co-operation Work?\r\n\r\n\r\nThat magic thing, \"Co-operation,\" while utterly lacking in the\r\nUtopian qualities with which the word artist paints it, is a\r\ndecidedly bigger factor in American affairs than the average man\r\nrealizes.\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulty with co-operation is that the manager, if not\r\nincompetent, has an excellent opportunity to be a grafter. In Europe\r\nco-operation in agricultural and mercantile enterprise is older and\r\nbetter developed than in this country. Perhaps the Europeans are\r\nless inclined to be grafters, but a more likely explanation is that\r\nthe members of such associations as these have learned how to\r\nprevent and detect graft, just as our business men have learned to\r\navoid losses from the dishonesty of employes. That this is the true\r\nexplanation is substantiated by the fact that when co-operation once\r\nbecomes established in this country, it succeeds even better than in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nWhen the creameries were started in the West several years ago,\r\nthere was much complaint of swindlers, fake stock companies, and\r\nco-operative ventures in which the manager absconded with the butter\r\nmoney. To-day more than half of the American creameries are\r\nco-operative and the number is constantly increasing. They are\r\nefficient and successful in every way, and to-day make the finest of\r\nbutter and pay the highest prices to the farmer for his cream. But\r\ntheir way was first paved and the business developed by successful\r\nprivate concerns.\r\n\r\nCo-operation is entirely feasible and successful where the people\r\nbehind the movement have enough interest in the enterprise and good\r\nenough business sense to run the proposition as efficiently as\r\nsimilar private enterprises are run. The idea that co-operation must\r\nalways result in a big saving is a misconception. Employes will not\r\nwork any harder for an association than for a private employer,\r\nsometimes not as hard. Certainly no employee will work as hard for an\r\nassociation as he will for himself.\r\n\r\nWhy people should expect to buy out the grocery store and hire the\r\ngrocer to run it and save money for themselves, is a thing I could\r\nnever understand. But if there is some great waste that co-operation\r\nwill prevent, as where seven milk wagons drive every morning over\r\nthe same route, or where the market of perishable crops is glutted\r\none day and starved the next, centralization, corporate or\r\nco-operate, will pay.\r\n\r\nI know of no better way to impress the reader with American\r\nco-operation in actual practice than to quote from a brief account\r\nof the California Fruit Growers' Exchange.\r\n\r\nThe Exchange was founded upon the theory that every member is\r\nentitled to furnish his pro rata of the fruit for shipment through\r\nhis association, and every association to its pro rata to the\r\nvarious markets of the country. This theory reduced to practice\r\ngives every grower his fair share, and the average price of all\r\nmarkets throughout the season.\r\n\r\nAnother cardinal provision of the plan was that all fruit should be\r\nmarketed on a level basis of actual cost, with all books and\r\naccounts open for inspection at the pleasure of the members. These\r\nbroad principles of full co-operation constitute the basis of the\r\nExchange movement.\r\n\r\nThe Exchange system is simple, but quite democratic. The local\r\nassociation consists of a number of growers contiguously situated,\r\nwho unite themselves for the purpose of preparing their fruit for\r\nmarket on a co-operative basis. They establish their own brands,\r\nmake such rules as they may agree upon for grading, packing and\r\npooling their fruit. Usually these associations own thoroughly\r\nequipped packing houses.\r\n\r\nAll members are given a like privilege to pick and deliver fruit to\r\nthe packing house, where it is weighed in and properly receipted\r\nfor. Every grower's fruit is separated into different grades,\r\naccording to quality, and usually thereafter it goes into the common\r\npool, and in due course takes its percentage of the returns\r\naccording to grade.\r\n\r\nAny given brand is the exclusive property of the Local Association\r\nusing it, and the fruit under this brand is always packed in the\r\nsame locality, and therefore of uniform quality. This is of great\r\nadvantage in marketing, as the trade soon learns that the pack is\r\nreliable.\r\n\r\nThere are more than eighty associations, covering every citrus fruit\r\ndistrict in California, and packing nearly two hundred reliable and\r\nguaranteed brands of oranges and lemons.\r\n\r\nThe several local Exchanges designate one man each from their\r\nmembership as their representative, and he is elected a director of\r\nthe California Fruit Growers' Exchange. By this method the\r\npolicy-making and governing power of the organization remains in the\r\nhands of the local Exchanges.\r\n\r\nFrom top to bottom the organization is planned, dominated and in\r\ngeneral detail controlled absolutely by fruit growers, and for the\r\ncommon good of all members. No corporation nor individual reaps from\r\nit either dividends or private gain.\r\n\r\nSo far we have dealt almost exclusively with the organization of the\r\nExchange, its co-operative aspects, and general policy at home.\r\nEqually important is its organization in the markets.\r\n\r\nSeeking to free itself from the shifting influence of speculative\r\ntrading, by taking the business out of the hands of middlemen at\r\nhome, the Exchange found it quite as important to maintain the\r\ncontrol of its own affairs in the markets.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose the Exchange established a system of exclusive\r\nagencies in all the principal cities of the country, employing as\r\nagents active, capable young men of experience in the fruit\r\nbusiness. Most of these agents are salaried, and have no other\r\nbusiness of any kind to engage their attention, and none of the\r\nExchange representatives handle any other citrus fruits. These\r\nagents sell to smaller cities contiguous to their headquarters, or\r\nin the territory covered by their districts.\r\n\r\nOver all these agencies are two general or traveling agents, with\r\nauthority to supervise and check up the various offices. These\r\ngeneral agents maintain in their offices at Chicago and Omaha, a\r\ncomplete bureau of information, through which all agents receive\r\nevery day detailed information as to sales of Exchange fruit in\r\nother markets the previous day. Possessing this data, the selling\r\nagent cannot be taken advantage of as to prices. If any agent finds\r\nhis market sluggish, and is unable to sell at the average prices\r\nprevailing elsewhere, he promptly advises the head office in Los\r\nAngeles, and sufficient fruit is diverted from his market to relieve\r\nit and restore prices to normal level.\r\n\r\nThrough these agencies of its own the Exchange is able to get and\r\ntransmit to its members the most trustworthy information regarding\r\nmarket conditions, visible supplies, etc. This system affords a\r\nmaximum of good service at a minimum cost. The volume of the\r\nbusiness is so large that a most thorough equipment is maintained at\r\nmuch less cost to growers than any other selling agency can offer.\r\n\r\nThe annual business of the California Fruit Growers' Exchange\r\namounts to over ten million dollars, and the Exchange handles over\r\nhalf the citrus fruit output of the State. Yet there are people who\r\nsay co-operation in America will not work.\r\n\r\n\r\nCo-operative Egg Marketing in Denmark.\r\n\r\nI have discussed at length the work of the California Fruit Growers'\r\nExchange, as the best example in the United States of the\r\nco-operative marketing of farm produce. We have thus far but little\r\nco-operative work in the marketing of poultry products. Canada has a\r\nfew examples, but it is to European countries that we must go for a\r\nfull demonstration of the principle of co-operation when applied to\r\nthe products of the hen. In England and in Ireland co-operative\r\nefforts in the growing, fattening, and marketing of poultry and eggs\r\nare quite common. It is to Denmark, however, that we must go to find\r\nthe most wholesale example of this truly modern type of business\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nThe Danes are co-operators in the fullest sense. They have\r\nco-operative creameries and co-operative packing houses. The Danish\r\nEgg Export Society is an organization, the plan and work of which is\r\nvery much like that of the California Fruit Growers' Exchange.\r\n\r\nThe local branch of the association buys the eggs of the farmer,\r\npaying for them by weight. Collectors are hired to gather them at\r\nfrequent and regular intervals, and are paid In accordance with the\r\namount of their collections, but must stand the loss of breakage.\r\nEach individual poultryman's eggs are kept separate until they reach\r\na centralizing station. There are a number of these central stations\r\nat which the eggs are carefully crated and packed for shipment to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe individual farmer is fined or taxed for all bad eggs found in\r\nhis lot. This fine is deducted from his receipts and he has nothing\r\nto do but to submit to it or get out of the association. The latter\r\nhe cannot afford to do because the association has its established\r\nbrands and can pay him more for his eggs than he could secure by\r\nattempting to market them himself. As a result of this strict system\r\nof making the producer responsible for weight and quality of the\r\neggs the Danish eggs have become the largest and finest in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAlthough the writer firmly believes in the co-operative marketing of\r\nfarm produce, and considers that the success already secured in this\r\nwork is conclusive evidence of the practicability and desirability\r\nof co-operation, it would not be fair to infer that co-operation has\r\nentirely driven out private or corporate enterprise. Just as a\r\ngoodly per cent. of the citrus fruit of California is still handled\r\nby private dealers, so in Denmark we find that nearly one-half of\r\nthe eggs sent to England are handled by private companies. Let it be\r\nnoted, however, that these companies maintain a system of buying on\r\nmerit which enforces high quality that is not to be found where\r\nprivate buyers are without the spur of co-operative competition.\r\nBefore co-operation entered the orange regions of California, the\r\nfruit was poorly packed and handled and the markets at times so\r\nglutted, that shipments of fruit sometimes failed to pay the\r\nfreight, and this was actually charged back to the unfortunate\r\ngrower. Co-operation has done away with this waste. In like manner\r\nthe great loss from decomposed eggs and half hatched chicks is\r\nunknown to the egg trade of Denmark.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorporation or Co-operation?\r\n\r\nThe community of farmers producing a large quantity of a single kind\r\nof product is the coming form of agricultural enterprise. Will this\r\ncommunity be promoted by corporation or by co-operation?\r\n\r\nArthur Brisbane says, \"As individual control of the Government has\r\nbeen superceded by collective control, so individual control of\r\nindustries will be followed by collective control. That is the\r\nnatural order.\"\r\n\r\nBrisbane is right. The individual, or the corporation, which is an\r\nindividual using other men's money, foreruns co-operation, because\r\nthe individual knows exactly what he wants to do and the big group\r\nof individuals does not know what they want or how to do it until\r\nindividuals have, by concrete successes, shown them.\r\n\r\nWhen the creameries were started, co-operative creameries were\r\nunsuccessful and could not compete with privately owned creameries.\r\nThe farmers have now become too wise to be \"easy-marks\" to the fake\r\ncreamery promoters or to trust their butter sales to a comparative\r\nstranger and co-operation is a success.\r\n\r\nPoultry communities cannot be made out of whole cloth by the\r\nco-operative plan. Private corporations will be necessary to launch\r\nthese enterprises. When they have reached the stage of development\r\nnow to be seen in Little Compton and Petaluma they are ready for\r\nco-operation.\r\n\r\nI have emphasized the point that the private corporation is the\r\nnatural forerunner in this matter in order to discourage premature\r\nor over-ambitious efforts at co-operation. Whenever a community of\r\npoultrymen or, for that matter, a community of growers of any\r\nperishable form of products, who are already successful in the\r\nproducing end, wish to take up co-operation and will see that men\r\nare selected to manage it who will use the same precautions to guard\r\nagainst incompetency or graft that they, as individuals, would use\r\nin their own business, there is excellent chance of success.\r\n\r\nGo slow. Do not expect to get rich quick by \"cutting out the\r\nmiddleman's enormous profits,\" for the middleman's profits are not\r\nenormous, and if you see that your co-operation is not paying, give\r\nit up and confess to yourselves that you do not know as much about\r\nthe business as your private competitors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nWHERE TO LOCATE\r\n\r\n\r\nThat poultry should be kept on every farm to supply the farmer's own\r\ntable does not permit of argument. When it comes to production for\r\nmarket, I believe there are some sections where it costs more to\r\nproduce and market poultry and eggs than is received for the product\r\nwhen sold. For illustration: On a farm which is twenty miles from\r\ntown and where grain cannot be profitably grown, the cost of teaming\r\ngrain from the railroad station and of sending the eggs to market as\r\nfrequently as is necessary to have a wholesome product, would\r\ncertainly eat up all possible profits.\r\n\r\nThe farmer thus located would find a more profitable use for his\r\ntime in some industry where the raw material is near at hand and the\r\nproduct needs less frequent marketing.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome Poultry Geography.\r\n\r\nWhen we are discussing poultry on the general farm, the problem of\r\nlocation is not to be taken into consideration, save to the extent\r\nthat there are a few localities where food cost is so high or\r\nmarketing facilities so poor as to make even the usual farm surplus\r\nunprofitable.\r\n\r\nThe map on page 45 shows the intensity of egg production and also\r\nindicates the location of the more important localities where\r\npoultry plants have succeeded. The map on page 47 shows the quality\r\nof eggs coming from various sections, which indicates pretty closely\r\nthe general development of the poultry industry. These indications,\r\nhowever, are of little value in locating a poultry plant, for they\r\nrefer to the poultry product on the general farm, and are a matter\r\nof the number and general intelligence of farmers, rather that a\r\nsign of the suitability of the locality for the poultry industry.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of discussion, I have divided the United States into\r\nseven sections as shown by the dotted lines on the second map.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate II. Page 45. Map:\r\nIntensity of egg production in the United States]\r\n\r\nSection 1 is the North Woods and too cold and remote for\r\nthe poultry business.\r\n\r\nSection 2 includes the great West, of which an adequate discussion\r\nis out of the question. Of course, the great majority of this area\r\nis too remote from markets for poultry production. The locations\r\naround the big cities in this section are excellent for poultry\r\nfarming, as they are so far removed from the great farm region that\r\ntheir bulk of imported eggs are of necessity somewhat stale.\r\nCalifornia is good chicken country. The Puget Sound country is\r\nrather too damp. In the interior western regions the chicken\r\nbusiness has not done well, chiefly because the atmosphere is too\r\ndry for the methods of artificial incubation attempted.\r\n\r\nSection 3 is the great granary of the world. It is also the home of\r\nthree-fourths of the country's poultry crop. It is a region of corn,\r\ncattle and hogs. Such a country will produce poultry in a very\r\ninexpensive manner. But it is not the region for special poultry\r\nfarms. In the northern portion of this tract, we find a heavy\r\nhousing expense and much winter labor necessary. It is a region of\r\nhigh priced lands and labor, and low prices for poultry products.\r\n\r\nEven the large cities in this region offer little in the way of\r\ndemand for high grade poultry products. This is because they are so\r\nabundantly surrounded with farms that all produce is moderately\r\nfresh and plentiful. There are no successful poultry farms in this\r\nsection west of the Mississippi. It is the natural location of\r\nextensive rather than intensive branches of agriculture. The only\r\ntype of commercial poultry farming that could succeed in any portion\r\nof this section would be a large community of producers who could\r\nship their products out regularly in carload lots. Such development\r\ncould only take place in the southern portion of this region, for\r\nthe housing expense is too great for the north. At best the distance\r\nfrom market is a disadvantage, for the rate on eggs just about\r\nequals the rate on the quantity of grain necessary to produce them.\r\nThe added time of shipment is something of a drawback, though in\r\nrefrigerator cars this is not serious. After the establishment of\r\npoultry communities becomes more common, the Oklahoma and Texas\r\nregion will become available for this purpose, but they must be\r\nestablished in full swing at the start, for a few isolated\r\npoultrymen have no chance at all in this section, for they cannot\r\nsell their product to advantage.\r\n\r\nSection 4. This region, extending from the Ozarks to Eastern\r\nTennessee, is one of the very best poultry sections. The climate is\r\nsuch that green food is available winter and summer, and the expense\r\nof housing and winter labor is reasonable. This section is still in\r\nthe corn growing region. The question is almost always one of\r\nrailroad facilities to get the product out. All poultry farms in\r\nthis section must grow their own grain or buy it of their immediate\r\nneighbors. It will not pay to ship grain into this region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate III. Page 47. Map:\r\nIntensity of egg production in the United States]\r\n\r\nWhen near shipping facilities, individual poultry farms in Section 4\r\nhave a good chance of success, especially east of the Mississippi.\r\nThis is the most favorable region in the country for the\r\nestablishment of poultry communities that are to grow their own\r\ngrain. Such poultry farms will not be expected to confine their\r\nattention as exclusively to the business as those in the section\r\nwhere it is profitable to import the grain.\r\n\r\nSection 5 is the non-grain growing region of the South. It at\r\npresent produces little poultry. The climate is all right for the\r\npurpose, but the freight rates on grain from the West are high and\r\nlikewise the freight service and freight rates to the final market\r\nare excessive. Under these conditions poultry farming will not pay\r\nexcept in a few localities as in Florida, where there is a high\r\nclass local market due to the popular resorts. If grain could be\r\nprofitably grown in this section the same type of poultry farming\r\nthat prevails in Section 4 would be advisable. Now, grain can be\r\ngrown in the cotton belt of the South, and many Yankee farmers are\r\nmaking good money doing it. But when grown it is liable to be worth\r\nmore to feed mules than to feed chickens.\r\n\r\nSection 6 is the \"Down East\" section of dense population. The land\r\nfor the most part is rocky, wooded and hilly. The climate and nature\r\nof the soil are against the economical production of poultry, but\r\nthe grain can be profitably fed, and as the markets are the best in\r\nthe country, commercial poultry farming has gained quite a foothold.\r\nIf a man is already located in this section and wishes to go into\r\nthe poultry business I would by all means say, \"Go ahead,\" but I\r\nwould not advise an outsider looking for a location to come here,\r\nfor the next section has several advantages.\r\n\r\nSection 7 is the best poultry farming district in the United States,\r\neither for the individual poultry plant or for the community of\r\npoultry growers. The reasons for this are:\r\n\r\nFirst: The soil is of a sandy nature and excellent land for poultry\r\nfarming can be had at a low price.\r\n\r\nSecond: The climate is much more favorable than farther north or\r\nfarther inland.\r\n\r\nThird: Grain rates from the West are very reasonable.\r\n\r\nFourth: The best market in the country--New York City--is within\r\neasy shipping distance.\r\n\r\nThe type of poultry farming here to be recommended, like that of\r\nSection 6, is one in which imported grain is fed. The fertility of\r\nthis grain, going back on the light soil, is used to grow the green\r\nfood required by the hens, and, in addition, may be used in a\r\nrotation system for growing truck. It will not pay to grow any\r\nquantity of grain. Section 7, because of its advantages over Section\r\n6 in climate and the availability of large tracts of suitable land,\r\nis a much better location for the poultry community. Over Section 4,\r\nwhich is the second best region for this purpose, it has the\r\nadvantage of nearness to markets. The climatic advantage of Sections\r\n4 and 7 are about on a par. The chief distinction is the matter of\r\ngrowing grain or importing it. If you are to grow your grain, using\r\npoultry as a means of marketing it, Section 4 is the best locality.\r\nIf you are to buy grain, Section 7 is the place.\r\n\r\nThe boundaries of Section 7 are not arbitrary and should be noted\r\ncarefully. The line runs from Mattawan, New Jersey, across to the\r\nmain line of the Pennsylvania and down this to Washington. To the\r\nnorth and west of this, the soils are heavy clays which are wet,\r\ncold, slushy and easily befouled. Likewise, the line on the south is\r\ndistinctly marked by the Norfolk and Western Railway and is a matter\r\nof freight rates on grain. Norfolk gets a rate of sixteen and a half\r\ncents from Chicago; a couple of hundred miles south, the rate is\r\nabout twice as much. Cheaper grain rates would of course extend this\r\nbelt on down the coast where the climate is even more favorable.\r\n\r\n\r\nChicken Climate.\r\n\r\n\r\nClimate is a big figure in the cost of poultry production. Every day\r\nthat water is frozen in winter means increased labor and decreased\r\negg yield. Mild winters means cheap houses, cheap labor, cheap feed\r\n(a large proportion of green food), an earlier chick season, which,\r\ntogether with the mild weather and green feed, mean a large\r\nproportion of the egg yield at the season when eggs are high in\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nThe American poultry editor wastes a great deal of ink explaining\r\nwhy the Australian egg records of 175 eggs per hen, cannot be so,\r\nbecause in this country, the hens at the Maine station only averaged\r\n125. The Maine Experiment Station lies buried in a snow drift for\r\nabout five months of the year. The Australian station has a winter\r\nclimate equal to that of New Orleans. The Australian records do not\r\ngo below thirty eggs per day per hundred hens at any time during the\r\nyear. Our New York and New England records run down anywhere from\r\none to ten eggs per day per hundred hens. The following table will\r\nshow the effect of the climate upon the distribution of the egg\r\nyield throughout the year. The records at New York are from a large\r\nnumber of hens of several different flocks and probably represent a\r\nnormal distribution of the egg yield for that section. The Kansas\r\nand Arkansas lists are taken from the record of small flocks and are\r\nnot very reliable. The fourth column gives the Australian records\r\nwith the months transferred on account of being in the southern\r\nhemisphere. The last column gives the railroad shipments from a\r\ndivision of the N.C. & St. L. railroad in Western Tennessee:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Column Headings:\r\n    NY--Central New York per hen per day\r\n    KS--Kansas Ex.

The California coast is fairly equable in temperature, but\r\nits winter rains and summer drouth are against it. The Atlantic\r\ncoast south of New York is fairly good, probably the best the\r\ncountry affords. The most southern portions will be rather too hot\r\nin summer, which will result in a small August and September egg\r\nyield. Probably the region around Norfolk is, all considered, the\r\nbest poultry climate the country affords.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuitable Soil.\r\n\r\nSoil is important in poultry farming; in fact it is very important,\r\nand many failures can be traced to soil mistakes. Rocky and\r\nuncultivated lands must not be chosen. To locate on any soil which\r\nwill not utilize the droppings for the production of green food, is\r\nto introduce a loss sufficient to turn success into failure.\r\n\r\nThe ideal soil for poultry is a soil too sandy to produce ordinary\r\nfarm crops successfully, and hence an inexpensive soil; but because\r\nland too sandy to be used for heavy farming is best for poultry,\r\nthis does not mean that any cheap soil will do. A heavy wet clay\r\nsoil worth $150 an acre for dairying is worth nothing for poultry.\r\nPure sand is likewise worthless and nothing can be more pitiable\r\nthan to see poultry confined in yards of wind swept sand, without a\r\nspear of anything green within half a mile.\r\n\r\nThe soils that are valuable for early truck are equally valuable for\r\npoultry. Sand with a little loam, or very fine sand, if a few green\r\ncrops are turned under to provide humus, are ideal poultry soils.\r\nThe Norfolk fine Sand and Norfolk Sandy Loam of the U.S. soil\r\nsurvey, are types of such soil.\r\n\r\nThese soils absorb the droppings readily and are never covered with\r\nstanding water. The winter snows do not stay on them. Crops will\r\nkeep greener on them in winter than on clay soils three hundred\r\nmiles farther south.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage of such soils is that they lose their fertility by\r\nleaching. The same principles that will cause the droppings to\r\ndisappear from the top of the ground will likewise cause them to be\r\nwashed down beyond the depths of plant roots. This loss must be\r\nguarded against by not going to the extreme in selecting a light\r\nsoil and may be largely overcome by schemes of running the poultry\r\nright among growing crops or by quick rotations.\r\n\r\nLand sloping to the southward is commonly advised for the purpose of\r\ngetting the same advantages as are to be had in a sandy soil. In\r\npractice the slope of the land cannot be given great prominence,\r\nalthough, other things being equal, one should certainly not\r\ndisregard this point. In heavy lands it is necessary to raise the\r\nfloors and grade up around the houses. The quickly drained soil does\r\naway with this expense.\r\n\r\nTimber on the land is a disadvantage. Poultry farming in the woods\r\nhas not been made a success. It's the same proposition of the\r\ndroppings going to waste. I know a man who bought a timbered tract\r\nbecause it was cheap and who scraped up the droppings to sell by the\r\nbarrel to his neighbor, who used them to fertilize his cabbage patch\r\nand in turn sold the poultryman cabbages to feed his hens, at 5\r\ncents a head. Of course, this man failed, as does practically every\r\nman who attempts to scrape dropping boards and carry poultry manure\r\naround in baskets, instead of using it where it falls.\r\n\r\nThere is little to be said in favor of uncleared land for the\r\npoultry business, but there is something that can be said in favor\r\nof the poultry business for uncleared land. A man who buys a\r\ntimbered land for trucking can get no income whatever the first\r\nyear, but the poultryman can begin his operations in the woods,\r\nclearing the land while he is raising a crop of chickens on it. The\r\ncoops may be placed in the cleared streak and most of the droppings\r\nutilized. In fact, the plan of a streak of timber alongside the\r\nhouses is not bad for a permanent arrangement--the birds certainly\r\nenjoy the shade. But the shade of growing crops is the most\r\nprofitable kind for poultry.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarketing--Transportation.\r\n\r\nThe possibilities of working up a local trade of high grade eggs at\r\nfancy prices varies greatly with the locality. Large cities and\r\nwealthy people are essentials. Other than this the principal\r\ndistinctions are that regions where a general surplus of eggs are\r\nproduced offer little chance for a fancy trade. Where the great bulk\r\nof eggs are imported fancy trade is more feasible. St. Louis is the\r\nsmallest western city that supports anything like a fancy trade in\r\neggs and there it is only on a small scale. Minneapolis, Omaha,\r\netc., would not pay 3 cents premium for the best eggs produced, but\r\ncities of the same size east of the Appalachians and especially in\r\nNew England, will pay a good premium. The Far West or the mountain\r\ndistricts will pay up better than the Mississippi Valley. The South\r\nwill pay a little better than the upper Mississippi Valley, but has\r\nfew cities of sufficient size to make such markets abundant. The\r\nSoutherner has little regard for quality in produce and the most\r\naristocratic people consume eggs regularly that the wife of a\r\nConnecticut factory hand wouldn't have in the house. The egg farmer\r\nwho expects to sell locally had best not locate south of Washington\r\nor west of Pittsburg, unless he goes to the Pacific Coast.\r\n\r\nWhere marketing is not done by wagon the subject of railroad\r\ntransportation is practically identical with the question of\r\nmarketing. It is the cost in freight service and freight rates that\r\ncount. The proposition of transportation, especially for the grain\r\nbuying poultry farm, catches us coming and going and both must be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nA poultry farm in Section 7 will buy one hundred pounds of feed per\r\nyear per hen and market one-third of a case of eggs. On this basis\r\nthe grain rate from Chicago or St. Louis and the egg rate to New\r\nYork must be balanced against each other. Don't take these things\r\nfor granted. Look them up.\r\n\r\nJamesburg and Freehold, two New Jersey towns ten miles apart and\r\nequi-distant and with equal freight rates from New York, might seem\r\nto the uninitiated as equally well situated to poultry farming. We\r\nwill suppose two men bought forty-acre farms of equal quality and\r\nequi-distant from the railroad stations at these two towns. Suppose,\r\nfurther, they each kept five thousand hens. Jamesburg is on a\r\nPhiladelphia-New York line of the Pennsylvania and its Chicago grain\r\nrate is the same as that of New York, namely: 19-1/2 cents per\r\nhundred. Freehold is on a branch line; its rate is 24-1/2 cents. In\r\na year the difference amounts to $250. Figured at six per cent.\r\ninterest, the land at Jamesburg is worth just about one hundred\r\ndollars an acre more than that at Freehold.\r\n\r\nLumber rates or local lumber prices should also be taken into\r\nconsideration. Whether one plans to ship his product out by express\r\nor freight will, of course, be an important consideration in\r\ndeciding the location.\r\n\r\nAs a general thing, the individual poultry farmer will, for shipping\r\nhis product, use express east of Buffalo and north of Norfolk. The\r\npoultry community could use freight in these same regions and get as\r\ngood or better service than by express.\r\n\r\nThe location in relation to the railroad station is equally\r\nimportant to the freight rate. Besides heavy hauling frequent trips\r\nwill be necessary in marketing eggs. These on the larger farms will\r\nbe daily or at least semi-weekly. On the heavy hauling alone, at 25\r\ncents per ton mile, distance from the railroad will figure up 1-1/4\r\ncents per hen which, on the basis of the previous illustration,\r\nwould make a difference of twenty-five dollars per acre for every\r\nmile of distance from the station. One of the most successful\r\npoultry farms I know is right along the railroad and has an elevator\r\nwhich handles the grain from the cars and later dumps it into the\r\nfeed wagons without its ever being touched by hand. The labor saving\r\nin this counts up rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe poultry community can have its own elevator and the grain can be\r\nsold to the farmer to be delivered directly into the hoppers in his\r\nfield with but a single loading into a wagon.\r\n\r\n\r\nAvailability of Water.\r\n\r\nOne more point to be considered in location is water.\r\n\r\nThe labor of watering poultry by carrying water in buckets is\r\ntremendous and not to be considered on any up-to-date poultry plant.\r\nWatering must be accomplished by some artificial piping system or\r\nfrom spring-fed brooks. The more length of flowing streams on a\r\npiece of land, provided the adjacent ground is dry, the more value\r\nthe property has for poultry. Two spring-fed brooks crossing a\r\nforty-acre tract so as to give a half mile of running water, or a\r\nfull mile of houses, would water five thousand hens without labor.\r\nThis would mean an annual saving of at least one man's time as\r\nagainst hand watering, or a matter of a thousand dollars or more in\r\nthe cost of installation of a watering system.\r\n\r\nIf running water cannot be had the next best thing is to get land\r\nwith water near the surface which may be tapped with sand points. If\r\none must go deep for water a large flow is essential so that one\r\npower pump may easily supply sufficient water for the plant.\r\n\r\nThe land should lay in a gentle slope so that water may be run over\r\nthe entire surface by gravity. Hilly lands are a nuisance in poultry\r\nkeeping and raise the expense at every turn.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Few Statistics.\r\n\r\nThe following table does not bear directly upon the poultry-man's\r\nchoice of a location, but is inserted here because of its general\r\ninterest in showing the poultry development of the country.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the egg production per hen is very low in the\r\nSouthern States. This may seem at variance with my previous\r\nstatements. The poor poultry keeping of the South is a fault of the\r\nindustrial conditions, not of the climate. Chickens on the Southern\r\nfarm simply live around the premises as do rats or English sparrows.\r\nNo grain is grown; there are no feed lots to run to, no measures are\r\ntaken to keep down vermin, and no protection is provided from wind\r\nand rain. In the North chickens could not exist with such treatment.\r\n\r\nThe figures given showing the relation between the poultry and total\r\nagricultural wealth is the best way that can be found to express\r\nstatistically the importance of poultry keeping in relation to the\r\ngeneral business of farming. These figures should not be confused\r\nwith the distribution of the actual volume of poultry products.\r\nIowa, the greatest poultry producing state, shows only a moderate\r\nproportion of poultry to all farm wealth, but this is because more\r\nagricultural wealth is produced in Iowa than in all the \"Down East\"\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nTable showing the development of the poultry industry in the various\r\nstates, according to the returns of the census of 1900:\r\n\r\n\r\n                No. of     Percentage of   No. of    Farm value\r\n                eggs per   farm wealth     eggs      of eggs per\r\n                capita     earned by       per hen   dozen\r\nStates                     poultry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlabama           124        4.9             48         9.7 cents\r\nArizona            80        4.5             60        19.9\r\nArkansas          235        6.8             58         9.1\r\nCalifornia        197        5.4             74        15.8\r\nColorado          127        5.4             71        15.0\r\nConnecticut       105       11.3             89        19.1\r\nDelaware          231       14.7             68        13.7\r\nFlorida            96        8.2             46        13.1\r\nGeorgia           156        4.4             41        10.4\r\nIdaho             213        5.0             67        16.2\r\nIndiana           338       10.0             77        10.5\r\nIowa              536        7.4             64        10.1\r\nIllinois          215        3.7             62        10.3\r\nKansas            597        8.2             73         9.9\r\nKentucky          198        8.3             62         9.8\r\nLouisiana         111        4.0             40        10.0\r\nMaine             233       11.0            100        15.3\r\nMaryland          126       10.4             71        12.6\r\nMassachusetts      56       11.7             96        19.9\r\nMichigan          270        9.7             82        11.2\r\nMinnesota         296        5.8             67        10.5\r\nMississippi       144        4.7             43         9.9\r\nMissouri          291       11.6             68         9.8\r\nMontana           148        4.3             67        21.0\r\nNebraska          463        6.1             66         9.9\r\nNevada             68        3.7             71        20.8\r\nNew Hampshire     238       11.5             96        17.3\r\nNew Jersey         76       12.0             72        16.2\r\nNew Mexico         45        2.7             65        18.7\r\nNew York          102        7.1             83        13.9\r\nNorth Carolina    112        5.7             55        10.2\r\nNorth Dakota      249        2.6             64        10.5\r\nOhio              265        9.6             77        11.2\r\nOklahoma          315        6.4             60         9.3\r\nOregon            224        6.2             72        15.1\r\nPennsylvania      112       10.8             75        13.5\r\nRhode Island       90       19.7             77        20.4\r\nSouth Carolina     80        4.0             41        10.3\r\nSouth Dakota      502        5.2             68        10.0\r\nTennessee         189        8.4             61         9.8\r\nTexas             228        4.8             52         8.0\r\nUtah              146        5.1             76        12.5\r\nVermont           219        7.5             94        15.3\r\nVirginia          165        8.9             67        11.1\r\nWashington        171        7.1             74        16.8\r\nWest Virginia     216       10.2             74        10.9\r\nWisconsin         268        7.1             68        10.5\r\nWyoming           121        2.4             79        17.4\r\nEntire U.S.       205        7.4             65        11.1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE DOLLAR HEN FARM\r\n\r\nAs has already been emphasized, the way to get money out of the\r\nchicken business is not to put so much in.\r\n\r\nLand, however, well suited to the purpose, should not be begrudged,\r\nfor interest at six per cent, will afford a very considerable extra\r\ninvestment in land well suited to the business if it in any way cuts\r\ndown the cost of operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Plan of Housing.\r\n\r\nThe houses are the next consideration. On most poultry farms they\r\nare the chief items of expense. I know of a poultry farm near New\r\nYork City where the house cost $12.00 per hen. The owner built this\r\nfarm with a view of making money. People also buy stock in Nevada\r\ngold mines with a view of making money. I know another poultry farm\r\nowned by a man named Tillinghast at Vernon, Connecticut, where the\r\nhouses cost thirty cents per hen. Mr. Tillinghast gets more eggs per\r\nhen than the New York man. Incidentally, he is sending his son to\r\nYale, and he has no other visible means of support except his\r\nchicken farm.\r\n\r\nFor the region of light soils and the localities which I have\r\nrecommended for poultry farming, the following style of poultry\r\nhouse should be used:\r\n\r\nNo floors, single boarded walls, a roof of matched cypress lumber or\r\nof cheap pine covered with tarred paper. This house is to have no\r\nwindows and no door. The roosts are in the back end; the front end\r\nis open or partly open; feed hoppers and nests are in the front end.\r\nThe feed hoppers may be made in the walls, made loose to set in the\r\nhouse, or made to shed water and placed outside the house. All\r\nwatering is to be done outside the houses; likewise any feeding\r\nbeyond that done in hoppers.\r\n\r\nThe exact style of the house I leave to the reader's own plan. Were\r\nI recommending complex houses costing several dollars per hen, this\r\ncertainly would be leaving the reader in the dark woods. With houses\r\nof the kind described it is hard to go far amiss. The simplest form\r\nis a double pitched roof, the ridge-pole standing about seven feet\r\nhigh, and the walls about four. The house is made eight by sixteen,\r\nand one end--not the side--left open. For the house that man is to\r\nenter, this form cannot be improved upon.\r\n\r\nThe only other points are to construct it on a couple of 4x4 runners\r\nso that it can be dragged about by a team. Cypress, or other\r\ndecay-proof wood should be used for these mud-sills. The framing\r\nshould be light and as little of it used as is consistent with\r\nfirmness. If the whole house costs more than twenty-five dollars\r\nthere is something wrong in its planning.\r\n\r\nThis house should accommodate seventy-five or eighty hens.\r\n\r\nFor smaller operations, especially for horseless, or intensive\r\nfarming, a low, light house may be used, which the attendant never\r\nenters. A portion of the roof lifts up to fill feed-hoppers, gather\r\neggs or spray. These small houses may be made light enough to be\r\nmoved short distances by a pry-pole, the team being required only\r\nwhen they are moved to a new field.\r\n\r\nNot one particle of poultry manure is to be removed from either\r\nstyle of house. Instead, the houses are removed from the manure,\r\nwhich is then scattered on the neighboring ground with a fork, or,\r\nif desired to be used on a field in which poultry may not run, it\r\nmay be loaded upon a wagon together with some of the underlaying\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nThere have been books and books written on poultry houses, but what\r\nI have just given is sufficient poultry-house knowledge for the\r\nDollar Hen man. If he hasn't enough intelligence to put this into\r\npractice, he has no business in the hen business. Additional\r\nbook-knowledge of hen-houses is useless; it may be harmful.\r\n\r\nIf you are sure that you are fool-proof, you may get Dr. Feather or\r\nReverend Earlobe's \"Book of Poultry House Plans.\" It will be a good\r\ntext-book for the children's drawing lessons.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Feeding System.\r\n\r\nOyster shells, beef scraps, corn, and one other kind of grain,\r\ntogether with an abundance of pasturage or green feed, is the sum\r\nand substance of feeding hens on the Dollar Hen Farm.\r\n\r\nThe dry feeds are placed in hoppers. They are built to protect the\r\nfeeds from the weather. The neck must be sufficiently large to\r\nprevent clogging, and the hopper so protected by slats in front that\r\nthe hen cannot toss the feed out by a side jerk of her head. These\r\nhoppers may be built any size desired. The grain compartments\r\nshould, of course, be made larger than the others. Weekly filling is\r\ngood, but where a team is not owned, it would be better to have the\r\nhoppers larger so that feed purchased, say, once a month, could be\r\ndelivered directly into the hoppers.\r\n\r\n\r\nWater Systems.\r\n\r\nThe best water system is a spring-fed brook.\r\n\r\nThe man proposing to establish an individual poultry plant, and who\r\nafter reading this book goes and buys a tract of land where an\r\nartificial water system is necessary, would catch Mississippi\r\ndrift-wood on shares. But there are plenty of such people in the\r\nworld. A man once stood all day on London Bridge hawking gold\r\nsovereigns at a shilling a-piece and did not make a sale.\r\n\r\nNext to natural streams are the made streams. This is the logical\r\nwatering method of the community of poultry farmers. These\r\nartificial streams are to be made by conducting the water of natural\r\nstreams back of the land to be watered, as in irrigation. It is the\r\nproblem of irrigation over again. Indeed, where trucking is combined\r\nwith poultry-growing, fowl watering should be combined with\r\nirrigation.\r\n\r\nIt may be necessary to dam the stream to get head, sufficient supply\r\nor both. In sandy soils, ditches leak, and board flumes must be\r\nsubstituted. The larger ones are made of the boards at right angles\r\nand tapered so that one end of one trough rests in the upper end of\r\nthe next lower section. The smaller, or lateral troughs may be made\r\nV-shaped.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the smaller sized flume is three cents a foot. Iron pipe\r\ncosts twelve cents a foot.\r\n\r\nThe greater the slope of the ground the smaller may be the troughs,\r\nbut on ground where the slopes are great, more expense will be\r\nnecessary in stilting the flumes to maintain the level, and the\r\nharder it will be to find a large section that can be brought under\r\nthe ditch.\r\n\r\nFluming water for poultry is, like irrigation, a community project.\r\nThe greatest dominating people of history have their origin in arid\r\ncountries. It was co-operate or starve, and they learned\r\nco-operation and conquered the earth. If a man interferes with the\r\nflume, or takes more than his share of the water, put him out. We\r\nare in the hen, not the hog business.\r\n\r\nCommunity water systems, where water must be pumped and piped in\r\niron pipe, is of course a more expensive undertaking. It will only\r\npay where water is too deep for individuals to drive sand points on\r\ntheir own property. There is certainly little reason to consider an\r\nexpensive method when there are abundant localities where simple\r\nplans may be used.\r\n\r\nOn sand lands, with water near the surface, each farmer may drive\r\nsand points and pump his water by hand. In this case running water\r\nis not possible, but the pipes or flumes may be arranged so that\r\nfresh pumping flushes all the drinking places and also leaves them\r\nfull of standing water. The simplest way to arrange this will be by\r\nwooden surface troughs as used in the fluming scheme. The only\r\ndifference is that an occasional section is made deeper so that it\r\nwill retain water.\r\n\r\nA more permanent arrangement may be made by using a line of\r\nthree-fourths inch pipe. At each watering place the pipe is brought\r\nto the surface so that the water flows into a galvanized pan with\r\nsloping sides. This pan has an overflow through a short section of\r\nsmaller tubing soldered to the side of the pan. The pipe line is\r\nparallel with the fence line, the pans supply both fields. By this\r\narrangement the entire plant may be watered in a few minutes. The\r\noverflow tubes are on one side. Using these tubes as a pivot the\r\npans may be swung out from under the fence with the foot and cleaned\r\nwith an old broom. Where the ground water is deep a wind mill and\r\nstorage tank would be desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\nOutdoor Accommodations.\r\n\r\nThe hen house is a place for roosting, laying and a protection for\r\nthe feed. The hen is to live out doors.\r\n\r\nOn the most successful New England poultry farms, warm houses for\r\nhens have been given up. Hens fare better out of doors in Virginia\r\nthan they do in New England, but make more profit out of doors\r\nanywhere than they will shut up in houses. If your climate will not\r\npermit your hen to live out doors get out of the climate or get out\r\nof the hen business.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a vast difference in the kind of out-of-doors.\r\nThe running stream with its fringe of trees, brush and rank growing\r\ngrass, forms daylight quarters for the hen par excellence. Rank\r\ngrowing crops, fodder piled against the fences, a board fence on the\r\nnorth side of the lot, or little sheds made by propping a platform\r\nagainst a stake, will all help. A place out of the wind for the hens\r\nto dust and sun and be sociable is what is wanted, and what must be\r\nprovided, preferably by Nature, if not by Nature then by the\r\npoultryman.\r\n\r\nThe hens are to be kept as much as possible out of the houses, in\r\nsheltered places among the crops or brush. They should not herd\r\ntogether in a few places but should be separated in little clumps\r\nwell scattered over the land. These hiding places for the hens must,\r\nof course, not be too secluded or eggs will be lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nEquipment for Chick Rearing.\r\n\r\nJust as the long houses for hens have been weighed and found\r\nwanting, so larger brooder houses, with one exception, have never\r\nbeen established on what may be called a successful basis. By\r\nestablishment on a successful basis, I mean established so that they\r\ncould be used by larger numbers of people in rearing market\r\nchickens. There are plenty of large brooder houses in use, just as\r\nthere are plenty of yarded poultry plants, but many intelligent,\r\nindustrious people have tried both systems only to find that the\r\ncost of production exceeds the selling price. This makes us prone to\r\nbelieve that some of those who claim to be succeeding may differ\r\nfrom the crowd in that they had more capital to begin with and hence\r\nlast longer.\r\n\r\nThe one exception I make to this is that of the South Shore Roaster\r\nDistrict of Massachusetts. Here steam-pipe brooder houses are used\r\nquite extensively. The logical reason that pipe brooder houses have\r\nfound use in the winter chicken business and not in rearing pullets\r\nis that of season and profits. When chicks are to be hatched in the\r\ndead of winter the steam-heated brooder house is a necessity. In\r\nthis limited use it is all right, where the profits per chick are\r\ngreat enough to stand the expense and losses.\r\n\r\nFor the rearing of the great bulk of spring chicks the methods that\r\nhave proven profitable are as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst: Rearing with hens as practiced at Little Compton. For\r\nsuggestions on this see the chapter entitled \"Poultry on the General\r\nFarm.\"\r\n\r\nSecond: Rearing with lamp brooder. Many large book-built poultry\r\nplants have been equipped with steam, or, more properly, hot water\r\nheated brooder houses, only to have a practical manager see that\r\nthey did not work, tear out the piping and fill the house with rows\r\nof common lamp brooders. The advantage claimed for the lamp brooder\r\nis that they can be regulated separately for each flock. As a matter\r\nof fact, the same regulation for each flock of chicks could be\r\nsecured with a proper type of hot water heaters and one of the most\r\npractical poultry farms in the country is now installing such a\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nA brooder system where hot air under the pressure of a blower or\r\ncentrifugal fan would seem ideal. So far the efforts made along\r\nthese lines have been clumsy and unnecessarily expensive. If the\r\ncontinuous house is ever made practical, I believe it will be along\r\nthis line, but at present I advise sticking to the methods that are\r\nknown to be successful.\r\n\r\nIndividual lamp brooders in colony houses are perhaps the most\r\ngenerally successful means of rearing chicks on northern poultry\r\nfarms. They are troublesome and somewhat expensive, but with\r\nproperly hatched chickens are more successful than hen rearing. In\r\nbuying such a brooder the chief points to be observed are: A good\r\nlamp, a heating device giving off the heat from a central drum, and\r\nan arrangement which facilitates easy cleaning. The brooder should\r\nbe large, having not less than nine square feet of floor space. The\r\nwork demanded of a brooder is not as exacting as with an incubator.\r\nThe heat and circulation of air may vary a little without harm, but\r\nthey must not fail altogether. The greatest trouble with brooders in\r\noperation is the uncertainty of the lamp. The brooder-lamp should\r\nhave sufficient oil capacity and a large wick. Brooder-lamps are\r\noften exposed to the wind, and, if cheaply constructed or poorly\r\nenclosed, the result will be a chilled brood of chicks, or perhaps a\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nThe chief thing sought in the internal arrangements of a brooder is\r\na provision to keep the chicks from piling up and smothering each\r\nother as they crowd toward the source of heat. This can be\r\naccomplished by having the warmest part of the brooder in the center\r\nrather than at the side or corner. If the heat comes from above and\r\na considerable portion of the brooder be heated to the same\r\ntemperature, no crowding will take place.\r\n\r\nThe temperature given for running brooders vary with the machine and\r\nthe position of the thermometer. The one reliable guide for\r\ntemperature is the action of the chicks. If they are cold they will\r\ncrowd toward the source of heat; if too warm they will wander\r\nuneasily about; but if the temperature is right, each chick will\r\nsleep stretched out on the floor. The cold chicken does not sleep at\r\nall, but puts in its time fighting its way toward the source of\r\nheat. In an improperly constructed or improperly run brooder the\r\nchicks go through a varying process of chilling, sweating and\r\nstruggling when they should be sleeping, and the result is puny\r\nchicks that dwindle and die.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the brooder for the sleeping accommodations of\r\nthe chicks is important, but this is not the only thing to be\r\nconsidered in a brooder. The brooder used in the early season, and\r\nespecially the outdoor brooder, must have ample space provided for\r\nthe daytime accommodation of the chick. In the colony house brooder\r\nsuch space will, of course, be the floor of the house.\r\n\r\nWhen operating on a large scale it will not pay to buy complete\r\nbrooders. The lamps and hovers can be purchased separately and\r\ninstalled in colony houses which do both for brooders and later for\r\nhouses for growing young stock. The universal hover sold by the\r\nPrairie State Incubator people is about as perfect a lamp hover as\r\ncan be made.\r\n\r\nThe cold brooder, or Philo box, as it has been popularly called, is\r\nthe chief item in a system of poultry keeping that has been widely\r\nadvertised. The principle of the Philo box is that of holding the\r\nair warmed by the chick down close to them by a sagging piece of\r\ncloth. The cloth checks most of the radiating heat, but is not so\r\ntight as to smother the chick. This limits the space of air to be\r\nwarmed by the chicks to such a degree that the body warmth is used\r\nto the greatest advantage. That chickens can be raised in these\r\nfire-less brooders, is not in question, for that has been abundantly\r\nproven, but most poultrymen believe that it will pay better,\r\nespecially in the North, to give the little fellows a few weeks'\r\nwarmth.\r\n\r\nCurtis Bros. at Ransomville, N.Y., who raise some twenty thousand\r\nchicks per year, have adopted the following system: The chicks are\r\nkept under hovers heated by hot water pipes for one week, or until\r\nthey learn to hover. Then they are put in Philo boxes for a week in\r\nthe same building but away from the pipes. The third week the Philo\r\nboxes are placed in a large, unheated room. After that they go to a\r\nlarge Philo box in a colony house.\r\n\r\nTo make a Philo house of the Curtis pattern, take a box 5 in. deep\r\nand 18 in. to 24 in. square. Cut a hole in one side for a chick\r\ndoor, run a strip of screen around the inside of the box to round\r\nthe corners. Now take a second similar box. Tack a piece of cloth\r\nrather loosely across its open face. Bore a few augur holes in the\r\nsides of either box. Invert box No. 2 upon box No. 1. This we will\r\ncall a Curtis box. It costs about fifteen cents and should\r\naccommodate fifty to seventy-five chicks.\r\n\r\nA universal hover in a colony coop or colony house, for which a\r\nCurtis box is substituted, as early in the game as the weather\r\npermits, is the method I advise for rearing young chicks. The lamp\r\nproblem we still have with us, but it is one that cannot be easily\r\nsolved. Large vessels or tanks of water which are regularly warmed\r\nby injection of steam from a movable boiler, offers a possible way\r\nout of the difficulty. On a plant large enough to keep one man\r\ncontinually at this work, this plan might be an improvement over\r\nfilling lamps, but for the smaller plant it is lamps, or go south.\r\n\r\nRearing young chicks is the hardest part of the poultry business.\r\nThere is a lot of work about it that cannot be gotten rid of. Little\r\nchicks must be kept comfortable and their water and feed for the\r\nfirst few days must needs be given largely by hand. They are to be\r\nearly led to drink from the regular water vessels and eat from the\r\nhoppers, but this takes time and patience.\r\n\r\nThe feeding of chicks I will discuss in the chapter on \"Poultry on\r\nthe General Farm,\" and as the same methods apply in both cases, I\r\nwill refer the reader to that section.\r\n\r\nAfter chicks get three or four weeks old their care is the simplest\r\npart of the poultry farm work and consists chiefly of filling feed\r\nhoppers and protecting them from vermin and thieves.\r\n\r\nBoard floor colony houses are used as a protection against rats and\r\nthis danger necessitates the protection of the opening by netting\r\nand the closing of the doors at night.\r\n\r\nCockerels must be gotten out of the flocks and sold at an early age.\r\nThose that are to be kept for sale or use as breeding birds should\r\nbe early separated from the pullets. Coops for growing chickens,\r\nespecially Leghorns, cannot be put among trees, as the birds will\r\nlearn to roost in the trees, causing no end of trouble to get them\r\nbroken of the habit.\r\n\r\nAll pullets save a few culls should be saved for laying. They are to\r\nbe kept two years. They should lay sixty-five to seventy per cent as\r\nmany eggs the second year as the first. They are sold the third\r\nsummer to make room for the growing stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty-five Acre Poultry Farms.\r\n\r\nThis section will be devoted to a general discussion of the type of\r\npoultry farms best suited to Section 4 and the southerly portions of\r\nSection 7 as discussed in the previous chapter.\r\n\r\nWe will discuss this type of farm with this assumption: That they\r\nare to be developed in large numbers by co-operative or corporate\r\neffort. This does not infer that they cannot be developed by\r\nindividual effort, and nine-tenths of the operations will remain the\r\nsame in the latter case.\r\n\r\nSuppose a large tract of land adjacent to railroad facilities has\r\nbeen found. The land in the original survey should be divided into\r\nlong, relatively narrow strips, lying at right angles to the slope\r\nof the land. The farmstead should occupy the highest end of the\r\nstrip. For a twenty-five acre or one-man poultry farm these strips\r\nshould be about forty rods in width. The object of this survey is to\r\npermit the water being run by gravity to the entire farm.\r\n\r\nThe first thing is the farmstead, including such orchard and garden\r\nas are desired. This stretches across the entire front end of the\r\nplace. The remainder of the strip is fenced in with chicken fence.\r\nThe farm is also divided into two narrow fields by a fence down the\r\ncenter of the strip. This fence, at frequent intervals, has\r\nremovable panels.\r\n\r\nThe year's season we will begin late in the fall. All layers are in\r\nfield No. 1 pasturing on rape, top turnips or other fall crops. In\r\nlot No. 2 is growing wheat or rye. As the green feed gets short in\r\nthe first lot the hens are let into lot No. 2. Sometime in March the\r\nhouses that have been brought up close to the gaps are drawn through\r\ninto the wheat field. The feed hoppers are also gradually moved and\r\nthe hens find themselves confined in lot No. 2 without any serious\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\nLot No. 1 is broken up as soon as weather permits and planted in\r\noats, corn, Kaffir corn and perhaps a few sunflowers. The oats form\r\na little strip near the coops and watering places and the Kaffir\r\ncorn is on the far side. As soon as corn planting is over the farmer\r\nbegins to receive his chickens from the hatchery. The brooders are\r\nnow placed in the corn field. The object of the corn is not green\r\nfood but for a shade and a grain crop.\r\n\r\nThe chicks are summered in the corn field and the hens in the wheat\r\nor rye. Whether the latter will head up will depend upon the number\r\nof the flock. It will be best to work the houses across to the far\r\nside and let that portion near the middle fence head up. As the old\r\ngrain gets too tough for green food strips of ground should be\r\nbroken up and sown in oats. The grain that matures will not be cut,\r\nbut the hens will be allowed to thresh it out. The straw may be cut\r\nwith mower or scythe for use as nesting material.\r\n\r\nSometime in June or early in July a little rape vetch or cow-peas is\r\ndrilled in between the rows of corn as on the far side from the\r\nchicken coops. During July or about the first of August, after all\r\ncockerels have been sold, the gates are opened and the pullets are\r\nallowed to associate with the hens. After this acquaintance ripens\r\ninto friendship the hen houses are worked back into the pullet lots.\r\nSurplus hens are sold off or new houses inserted as the case may be\r\nuntil there is room for the pullets in the houses. Each coop is\r\nworked up alongside a house and after most of the pullets have taken\r\nto the houses the coops are removed. The vacant lot is now broken up\r\nand sown in a mixture of fall green crops.\r\n\r\nThe flock is kept in the corn field until the corn is ripe. The\r\nKaffir corn and sunflowers are knocked down where they stand and are\r\nthreshed by the hens. As soon as the corn crop is ripe the houses\r\nare run back and the corn cut up or husked and the wheat planted in\r\nthe corn field.\r\n\r\nThe next year the lots are transposed, the young stock being grown\r\nin the lot that had the hens the previous year.\r\n\r\nIf the ground is inclined to be at all damp when the fields are\r\nbroken up the plowing is done in narrow lands so as to form a\r\nsuccession of ridges, on which are placed the coops or houses. The\r\ndirections of these ridges will be determined by the lay of the\r\nland--the object being neither to dam up water or to encourage\r\nwashing. The location of the ridges are alternated by seasons, so\r\nthat the droppings from the houses are well distributed throughout\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nThis system with the particular crops found that do best in the\r\nlocality, give us an ideal method of poultry husbandry. We have kept\r\nhens and young stock supplied with green food the year round; we\r\nhave utilized every particle of manure without one bit of labor. We\r\nhave a rotation of crops. We have the benefits to the ground of\r\nseveral green crops turned under. We have raised one grain crop per\r\nyear on most of the ground. We have no labor in feeding and watering\r\nexcept the keeping of the grain, beef and grit hoppers filled, and\r\nthe water system in order.\r\n\r\nThe number of fowls that may be kept per acre will be determined by\r\nthe richness of the soil. The chief object of the entire scheme is\r\nto provide abundant green pasture at all times and to allow the\r\nproduction of a reasonable amount of grain. With one hundred hens\r\nper acre on the entire tract, and with houses containing eighty hens\r\neach, it will be necessary to set the houses ninety-five feet apart.\r\nThis will give the flock a tract of 95 by 330 feet in which to\r\npasture.\r\n\r\nThe above estimate with a little land allowed for house, garden,\r\norchard and a little cow and team pasture, will permit the keeping\r\nof two thousand hens on a twenty-five acre farm. In regions where\r\ngrain is to be raised most farmers would want more land. They may\r\nalso wish to own a few extra cows, hogs, etc., or to alternate the\r\nentire poultry operations with some crop that will, on such highly\r\nfertilized land, give a good cash profit. Forty acres is a good size\r\nfor such uses.\r\n\r\nThe cost of land when purchased in large tracts in Virginia is very\r\nsmall, but the cost of clearing is often much more than that of the\r\nland. Twenty-five to fifty dollars an acre should secure such a\r\ntract of land and put it in shape for poultry farming.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the farm home, etc., will, of course vary altogether\r\nwith the taste of the occupant. If they are constructed by a central\r\ncompany, from five hundred to a thousand dollars should cover the\r\namount.\r\n\r\nThe cost of poultry buildings and equipment used on the farm will\r\ndepend largely on the efficiency of the labor of construction. If\r\nconstructed in large numbers by a central company, the cost would be\r\nreduced, but the company would expect to make a profit on their\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nA plot laid out for two thousand hens will require in material: 250\r\nrods of fence with 6-ft. netting which should cost about fifty cents\r\na rod. My estimate of this fence put up would be $150. If the\r\nneighboring field contained no other poultry, a portion of this\r\nfence might be done away with, although its protection against dogs\r\nand strangers may be worth while. Of course, if poultry fields of\r\ndifferent owners lay adjoining, the fence must be used, but the cost\r\nwill be reduced one-half.\r\n\r\nThe next most expensive piece of equipment will be a line of about\r\neighty rods of 3/4 in. gas pipe and about fifty elbows and\r\ntwenty-five galvanized iron pans. The cost of installation will\r\ndepend largely on how deep it is necessary to go to get below the\r\nfrost line. One hundred and seventy-five dollars should cover cost\r\nof material and by the use of a plow the line ought to be put in for\r\ntwenty-five dollars.\r\n\r\nThe source of water, and the cost of getting a head, will\r\nnecessarily vary with the location. The installation of a wind mill\r\nand tank to hold supply for several days, or of a small gasoline\r\nengine, would cost in the neighborhood of one hundred dollars, but\r\nit is a luxury that may be dispensed with if the well is not too\r\ndeep.\r\n\r\nThe houses for the hens, of which there are twenty-five, are\r\nconstructed in accordance with some of the plans previously\r\ndiscussed. The cost should be about twenty-five cents per hen.\r\n\r\nAt least twice as many brooders as colony coops will be needed as\r\nthere are hen houses, but of the lamps and hovers not over\r\ntwenty-five will be required, as the chicks soon outgrow the need of\r\nthis aid.\r\n\r\nThis makes a list of equipment required for the keeping of two\r\nthousand layers and their replenishing:\r\n\r\n    25 acres of farm land, at $50 per acre    $1250.00\r\n    250 rods of fence                           150.00\r\n    One farmstead                              1000.00\r\n    One team, plow and farm implements          300.00\r\n    One watering system                         300.00\r\n    25 hen houses, at $20                       500.00\r\n    50 colony coops, at $2.50                   150.00\r\n    25 lamps and hovers, at $5                  125.00\r\n                                              --------\r\n                                              $3775.00\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note: \"50 colony coops, at $2.50\" is $125.00, not\r\n$150. The total should therefore be $3750 rather than $3775. This\r\nwas, presumably, a printing error, because the correct total is\r\nused in the further calculations below.]\r\n\r\nThis is a good, liberal capitalization. The business can be started\r\nwith much less. Figured interest at 6 per cent. we have $225.00 per\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe upkeep of the plant will be about 15 per cent. on the capital,\r\nnot counting land. This equals $375, which, added to interest, gives\r\nan annual overhead expense of $600, which is our first item to be\r\nset against gross receipts.\r\n\r\nThe cost of operation will involve cost of chicks at hatchery,\r\npurchased feed, seed for ground, and feed for team.\r\n\r\nThe price of chicks at the Petaluma hatcheries is from six to eight\r\ncents each. We expect to raise enough pullets to make up for the\r\naccidental losses, and to renew bulk of the flock each year. The\r\nnumber required will, of course, depend upon the loss. This loss\r\nwill be much less when the chicks are obtained from a modern\r\nmoisture controlled hatchery, than from the box type incubator. I\r\nthink a 33 per cent. loss is a liberal estimate, but as I am\r\ntreading on unproven ground, I will make that loss 40 per cent.,\r\nwhich is on a par with old style methods. To replace 1,000 hens,\r\nthis will require 3,500 chicks at a cost of about two hundred and\r\nfifty dollars.\r\n\r\nGreen pasturage throughout the year will materially cut down the\r\ncost of feed. The corn consumed out of the hoppers will be about one\r\nbushel per hen. The beef scrap will also be less than with yarded\r\nfowls, perhaps twenty-five cents per hen. Now, of the corn we will\r\nraise on the land, at least ten acres. This should yield us five\r\nhundred bushels. This leaves fifteen hundred bushels of corn to be\r\npurchased. At the present high rates, this will cost $1,000 which,\r\nadded to beef scrap cost, makes an outside feed cost of $1,500. The\r\nseed cost of rye, rape, cow-peas, etc., will amount to about $50 per\r\nannum. For expense of production we have:\r\n\r\n    Interest and upkeep of plant    $600.00\r\n    Chicks                           250.00\r\n    Purchased corn                  1000.00\r\n    Beef scrap and grit              500.00\r\n    Seed                              50.00\r\n    Team feed                        100.00\r\n                                  ---------\r\n                                  $2,500.00\r\n\r\nThis figures out the cost of production at a little more than a\r\ndollar per hen. The income from the place should be about as\r\nfollows: Eleven hundred cockerels sold as squab broilers at 40 cents\r\neach, $440.00; four hundred and seventy-five old hens at 30 cents,\r\n$140.00.\r\n\r\nThe receipts from egg yield are, of course, impossible of very\r\naccurate calculation, for it is here that the personal element that\r\ndetermines success or failure enters. The Arkansas per-hen-day\r\nfigures (see last chapter), multiplied by the average quotation for\r\nextras in the New York market, will be as fair as any, and certainly\r\ncannot be considered a high estimate, as it is only 113 eggs per hen\r\nper year.\r\n\r\n                             Price per doz   Income for\r\n                  Eggs per   Extras          month from\r\n                  hen day    in New York     2000 layers\r\n                  ---------------------------------------------\r\n    January       .32        $ .30           $494.00\r\n    February      .30          .29            404.00\r\n    March         .62          .22            700.00\r\n    April         .38          .19            350.00\r\n    May           .44          .19            429.00\r\n    June          .42          .18            377.00\r\n    July          .34          .21            367.00\r\n    August        .38          .22            429.00\r\n    September     .21          .25            262.00\r\n    October       .22          .28            316.00\r\n    November      .18          .33            267.00\r\n    December      .15          .32            246.00\r\n                                           ---------\r\n    Total                                  $4,641.00\r\n\r\nThe total income as figured will be $5,221. From this subtract the\r\ncost of production, and we have still nearly $3,000, which is to be\r\ncombined item of wages and profit. We have entered no labor bill\r\nbecause this is to be a one-man farm, and with the assistance of the\r\npublic hatchery and co-operative marketing association, which will\r\nsend a wagon right to a man's door to gather the eggs, it is\r\nentirely feasible for one man to attend to two thousand hens. In the\r\nrush spring season other members of the family will have to turn out\r\nand help, or a man may be hired to attend the plowing and rougher\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThis is a good handsome income, and yet the above price of the man's\r\nlabor--it is only about one dollar per hen, which has always been\r\nthe estimated profit of successful poultry keeping. As a matter of\r\nfact, this profit is seldom reached under the old system of poultry\r\nkeeping, not because the above gross income cannot be reached, but\r\nbecause the expenses are greater. Under the present methods, with\r\nthe exception of the rearing of the young chicks, one man can easily\r\ntake care of three thousand hens. Indeed, practically the only work\r\nin their care is cultivating the ground and hauling around and\r\ndumping into hoppers, about two loads of feed per week.\r\n\r\nBut, young chicks must be reared, and this is more laborious. For\r\nthis reason I advise going into some other industry on a part of the\r\nland, which will not require attention in the young chick season.\r\nOne of the best things for this purpose is the cultivation of cane\r\nfruits as blackberries, raspberries and dewberries. The work of\r\ncaring for these can be made to fall wholly without the young chick\r\nseason. Peaches and grapes for a slower profit can be added, but\r\nspraying and cultivation of these is more liable to take spring\r\nlabor. All these fruits have the advantage of doing well in the same\r\nkind of soil recommended for chickens. Young chickens may be grown\r\naround such berry crops and removed to permanent quarters before the\r\nberries ripen. Strawberries would be a very poor crop because their\r\nlabor falls in the chick season.\r\n\r\nAnother plan, and perhaps a better one, is to have about three\r\nfields, and rotate in such a manner that a marketable crop may be\r\nalways kept growing in the third field. Any crop may be selected,\r\nthe chief labor of which falls between July and the following March.\r\nLate cabbage and potatoes, or celery, will do if the ground is\r\nsuitable for these crops. Kale and spinach are staple fall crops.\r\nFall lettuce could also be grown. If the market is glutted on such\r\ncrops, they can be fed out at home. Whenever a field is vacant, have\r\nsome crop growing on it, if only for purposes of green manuring.\r\nNever let sandy ground lie fallow.\r\n\r\nA modification of the above plans suited to heavier ground, is to\r\nseed down the entire farm to grass. It is then divided into three\r\nfields and provided with three sets of colony houses. Coops are\r\nentirely dispensed with, and cheap indoor brooders are used in the\r\npermanent houses. The pullets stay in these same houses in the same\r\nfield until the moulting season of the third year, or until they are\r\ntwo and a half years old. One field will always be vacant during the\r\nfall and winter season which time may be utilized for fresh seeding.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of maintaining a sod will necessitate somewhat\r\nheavier soil than by the previous plan. The houses should be moved\r\naround occasionally, as the grass kills out in the locality. This\r\nplan is a lazy man's way, taking the least labor of any method of\r\npoultry keeping known. It is adapted to the cheaper ground in the\r\nregion farthest from market. On the Atlantic seaboard, the more\r\nenterprising man will use the third field for rotation, and sell\r\nsome of the fertility of the western grain in the form of a truck\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive Acre Poultry Farms.\r\n\r\nCan a living for a family be made from a five acre poultry farm?\r\nYes; by individual effort, where the marketing opportunities are\r\ngood; by corporate or co-operate effort, any place where the\r\nfundamental conditions are right.\r\n\r\nThis type of poultry farm is well suited for development near our\r\nlarge cities, where the cry of \"back to the land\" has filled with\r\nnew hope the discouraged dweller in flat and tenement. No greater\r\nchance for humanitarian work, and at the same time no greater\r\nbusiness opportunity, is open to-day than that of the promotion of\r\ncolonies of small poultry and truck farms where the parent colony\r\nnot only sells the land, but helps the settler to establish himself\r\nin the business and to successfully market the product. The natural\r\nlocation for such projects is in the sandy soils of New Jersey,\r\nDelaware, Maryland and Virginia.\r\n\r\nWe have already discussed the twenty-five acre farm, representing\r\nthe largest probable unit for such an enterprise. We will now\r\ndiscuss the five acre farm which represents the smallest probable\r\nunit.\r\n\r\nOn the five-acre farm a considerable difference of methods will be\r\nnecessary. In the first place, it is to be a horseless farm. All\r\nhauling and plowing must be attended to by the central company, or\r\nthe same results could be obtained by a team owned in common by a\r\nsmall group, say of six farmers, each of whom is to use the team one\r\nday of the week.\r\n\r\nA single isolated farmer in a community of farms or market\r\ngardeners, could hire a team by the day as he needed it. I do not\r\nrecommend this scheme, however, but would suggest that the single\r\nindividual get a larger plot of ground, at least ten acres, and a\r\nteam of his own. In the co-operative community the five-acre\r\nteamless farm is entirely feasible.\r\n\r\nThe tract should be surveyed about twice as long as wide, which, for\r\nfive acres, makes it 20 by 40 rods, or 330 by 660 feet. Measure off\r\na strip one hundred feet back from the road. Fence the remainder of\r\nthe tract. Now run a partition fence down the center until we have\r\ncome to within twelve rods of the back side. Here run a cross fence.\r\nThis gives us three yards of about one and one-half acres each. The\r\ngates are arranged so that one passes through the three yards in a\r\nsingle trip.\r\n\r\nWhere the middle partition fence adjoins the front fence, a well is\r\ndriven. A water line is run down the partition fence to the rear\r\nyard.\r\n\r\nThe plot around the house is set in permanent crops, such as\r\nberries, fruit trees, asparagus, rhubarb, etc. Of the other three\r\nyards, at least one is kept in growing marketable crops. Every inch\r\nis cultivated, and crops of the leafy nature, as lettuce, cabbage,\r\nkale and spinach, are chiefly grown, as they utilize the rich\r\nnitrogenous poultry manure to the best advantage, and the waste\r\nportions, or worthless crops, are utilized for the poultry. The\r\nmethod of supplying the fowls with green food is entirely by\r\nsoiling. This means to grow the food in an adjoining lot and throw\r\nit over the fence. The above mentioned crops are all good for the\r\npurpose. Rape, which is not grown for human food, is also excellent.\r\n\r\nKale is one of the very best crops for soiling purposes. It is\r\nplanted in the fall and fed by pulling off the lower leaves during\r\nthe winter. In the spring the hardened stalks stand at a\r\nconsiderable height and the field may be used for growing young\r\nchicks, giving shade, and at the same time producing abundant green\r\nfeed, without any immediate labor, which means a great saving in the\r\nbusy season.\r\n\r\nA set of panels or netting stretched on light frames is provided.\r\nThey are of sufficient number to set along the longest side of one\r\nof the fields. A strip along the fence, four or five feet wide, can\r\nbe planted to sunflowers, corn, rape, kale, or other rank growing\r\ncrop and the panels leaned against the fence to protect the young\r\nplants from the hens. In this way the fence rows can be kept\r\nprovided with the shade of growing crops, which relieves the\r\notherwise serious fault of this plan of poultry farming, in that the\r\nhens would be required to live in absolutely barren and sunburned\r\nlots, for we propose to keep five or six hundred hens on one and a\r\nhalf acres of ground, and no green things could get a start without\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nRotate the houses from field to field as often as the crops allow.\r\nNever permit hens to run in one bare field for more than six months\r\nat a time. Always keep every inch of ground not in use by the\r\nchickens, luxuriant in something green. If you have a crop of\r\nvegetables which are about matured, drill rape or crimson clover\r\nbetween the rows; by the time the crop is harvested and the hens are\r\nto be moved in, such crops will have made a good growth. The hens\r\nwill kill it out but it will be a \"profitable killing.\"\r\n\r\nBy this system of intensive combination of trucking and poultry\r\nfarming, we have a combination which for small capital and small\r\nlands cannot be beaten. The hens should yield better than a dollar\r\nprofit per head on this plan; the one and a half acres automatically\r\nfertilized and intensely cultivated, growing two or three crops a\r\nyear, should easily double the income.\r\n\r\nTwelve hundred dollars a year is a conservative estimate for the net\r\nincome from such a plant, and the original investment, exclusive of\r\nresidence, will not be over one thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nINCUBATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe differences in the process of reproduction in birds and mammals\r\nis frequently misunderstood. The laying of the bird's egg is not\r\nanalogous to the birth of young in mammals.\r\n\r\nThe female, whether bird or beast, forms a true egg which must be\r\nfertilized by the male sperm cell before the offspring can develop.\r\nIn the mammal, if fertilization does not occur, the egg which is\r\ninconspicuous, passes out of the body and is lost. If fertilized, it\r\npasses into the womb where the young develops through the embryonic\r\nstages, being supplied with nourishment and oxygen directly by the\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nIn the bird, the egg, fertilized or unfertilized, passes out of the\r\nbody and, being of conspicuous size, is readily observed. The size\r\nof the egg is due to the supply of food material which is comparable\r\nwith that supplied to the mammalian young during its stay in the\r\nmother's womb.\r\n\r\nThe reptiles lay eggs that are left to develop outside of the body\r\nof the mother, subject to the vicissitudes of the environment. The\r\nyoung of the bird, being warm blooded, cannot develop without more\r\nuniform temperature than weather conditions ordinarily supply. This\r\nheat is supplied by the instinctive brooding habit of the mother\r\nbird.\r\n\r\n\r\nFertility of Eggs\r\n\r\nIn a state of nature the number of eggs laid by wild fowl are only\r\nas many as can be covered by the female. These are laid in the\r\nspring of the year, and one copulation of the male bird is\r\nsufficient to fertilize the entire clutch. Under domestication, the\r\nhen lays quite indefinitely, and is served by the male at frequent\r\nintervals. The fertilizing power of the male bird extends over a\r\nperiod of about 15 days.\r\n\r\nFor most of my readers, it will be unnecessary to state that the\r\nmale has no influence upon the other offspring than those which he\r\nactually fertilizes within this period. The belief in the influence\r\nof the first male upon the later hatches by another male is simply a\r\nsuperstition.\r\n\r\nThe domestic chicken is decidedly polygamous. The common rule is one\r\nmale to 12 or 15 hens. I have had equally good results, however,\r\nwith one male to 20 hens. In the Little Compton and South Shore\r\ndistricts, one male is used for thirty or even forty hens.\r\n\r\nBy infertile eggs is meant eggs in which the sperm cell has never\r\nunited with the ovum. Such eggs may occur in a flock from the\r\nabsence of the male, from his disinclination or physical inability\r\nto serve the hens, from the weakness or lack of vitality in the\r\nsperm cells, from his neglect of a particular hen, from\r\nlifelessness, or lack of vitality in the ovule, or from chance\r\nmisses, by which some eggs fail to be reached by the sperm cells.\r\n\r\nIn practice, lack of sexual inclination in a vigorous looking\r\nrooster is very rare indeed. The more likely explanation is that he\r\nneglects some hens, or that the eggs are fertilized, but the germs\r\ndie before incubation begins, or in the early stages of that\r\nprocess. The former trouble may be avoided by having a relay of\r\nroosters and shutting each one up part of the time. The latter\r\ndifficulty will be diminished by setting the egg as fresh as\r\npossible, meanwhile storing them in a cool place. The other factors\r\nto be considered in getting fertile eggs, are so nearly synonymous\r\nwith the problems of health and vitality in laying stock generally,\r\nthat to discuss it here would be but a repetition of ideas.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the discussion of fertile eggs, I want to point\r\nout the fact that the whole subject of fertility as distinct from\r\nhatchability, is somewhat meaningless. The facts of the case are,\r\nthat whatever factors in the care of the stock will get a large\r\npercentage fertile eggs, will also give hatchable eggs and vice\r\nversa. This is to be explained by the fact that most of the\r\nunfertile eggs tested out during incubation, are in reality dead\r\ngerms in which death has occurred before the chick became visible to\r\nthe naked eye. Such deaths should usually be ascribed to poor\r\nparentage, but may be caused by wrong storage or incubation.\r\nLikewise, it would not be just to credit all deaths after chicks\r\nbecame visible to wrong incubation, although the most of the blame\r\nprobably belongs there.\r\n\r\nLikewise, with brooder chicks, we must divide the credit of their\r\nlivability in an arbitrary fashion between parentage, incubation,\r\nand care after hatching.\r\n\r\nBy the hatchability of eggs, we then mean the percentage of eggs set\r\nthat hatch chicks able to walk and eat. By the livability of chicks,\r\nwe mean the percentage of chicks hatched that live to the age of\r\nfour weeks, after which they are subject to no greater death rate\r\nthan adult chickens. By the livability of eggs, we mean the product\r\nof these two factors, i.e.: the percentage of chicks at four weeks\r\nof age based upon the total number of eggs set.\r\n\r\nAs before mentioned, the fertility of eggs bears fairly definite\r\nrelation to the hatchability, so likewise the hatchability bears a\r\nrelation to the livability of chicks. When poor hatches occur\r\nbecause of weak germs, as because of faulty incubation, this same\r\ninjury to the chick's organism is carried over and causes a larger\r\ndeath among the hatched chicks.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the relation between the two is not the same with all\r\nclasses of hatches, but as hatches get poorer the mortality among\r\nthe chicks increases at an accelerating rate. The following table\r\ngives a rough approximation of these ratios:\r\n\r\n  Per cent. of    Per cent. of chick   Per cent. of egg\r\n  Hatchability.   Livability.          Livability.\r\n      100               100                  100\r\n       90                95                   85\r\n       80                88                   70\r\n       70                84                   50\r\n       60                72                   43\r\n       50                55                   27\r\n       40                40                   16\r\n       30                24                    7\r\n       20                10                    2\r\n       10                 2                    1\r\n\r\nThese figures are based on incubator data. Eggs set under hens\r\nusually give a hatchability of 50 per cent. to 65 per cent., and\r\nlivability of 70 per cent. to 80 per cent. The reason for the\r\ngreater livability is that the real hatchability of the eggs is 70\r\nper cent. to 75 per cent., and is reduced by mechanical breakage.\r\nThe hatchability of eggs varies with the season. This variation is\r\ncommonly ascribed to nature, it being stated that springtime is the\r\nnatural breeding season, and therefore eggs are of greater\r\nfertility.\r\n\r\nWhile there may be a little foundation for this idea, the chief\r\ncause is to be found in the manner of artificial incubation, as will\r\nbe discussed in a later section of this chapter. The following table\r\nis given as the seasonable hatchability for northern states. This is\r\nbased on May hatch of 50 per cent:\r\n\r\n    January       38      July         40\r\n    February      42      August       40\r\n    March         47      September    42\r\n    April         49      October      43\r\n    May           50      November     40\r\n    June          46      December     35\r\n\r\nMost people have an exaggerated idea of the hen's success as a\r\nhatcher. I have a number of records of hen hatching with large\r\nnumbers of eggs set, and they are all between 55 per cent. and 60\r\nper cent. The reasons the hen does not hatch better are as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst: Actual infertile eggs--usually, running about 10 per cent. in\r\nthe best season of the year.\r\n\r\nSecond: Mechanical breakage.\r\n\r\nThird: Eggs accidentally getting chilled by rolled to one side of\r\nthe nests, or by the sick, lousy or crazy hens leaving the nests or\r\nstanding up on the eggs.\r\n\r\nFourth: Eggs getting damp from wet nests, dung or broken eggs; thus\r\ncausing bacterial infection and decay.\r\n\r\nThe last three causes are not present in artificial incubation. From\r\nmy observation they cause a loss of 15 per cent. of the eggs that\r\nfail to hatch, when hens are managed in large numbers. This would\r\nproperly credit our hens with hatches running from 70 per cent. to\r\n75 per cent., which, for reasons later explained, is not equal to\r\nhatches under the best known conditions of artificial incubation.\r\n\r\nThe assumption that the hen is a perfect hatcher, even barring\r\naccidents and the inherited imperfection of the egg, is not, I\r\nthink, in harmony with our general conception of nature. Not only\r\nare eggs under the hens subject to unfavorable weather conditions,\r\nbut the hen, to satisfy her whims or hunger, frequently remains too\r\nlong away from the eggs, allowing them to become chilled.\r\n\r\nFor directions of how to manage setting hens, consult the Chapter on\r\n\"Poultry on the General Farm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wisdom of the Egyptians.\r\n\r\nUp to the present there have been just three types of artificial\r\nincubation that have proven successful enough to warrant our\r\nattention. These are:\r\n\r\nFirst, the modern wooden-box-kerosene-lamp incubator which is seen\r\nat its best development in the United States.\r\n\r\nSecond, the Egyptian incubator of ancient origin, which is a large\r\nclay oven holding thousands of eggs and warmed by smouldering fires\r\nof straw.\r\n\r\nThird, the Chinese incubator, much on the principle of the Egyptian\r\nhatchery, but run in the room of an ordinary house, heated with\r\ncharcoal braziers and used only for duck eggs.\r\n\r\nI have no accurate information on the results of the Chinese method,\r\nand as it is not used for hen eggs, we will confine our attention to\r\nthe first two processes only.\r\n\r\nI do not care to go into detail in discussing makes of box\r\nincubators, but I will mention briefly the chief points in the\r\ndevelopment of our present machines.\r\n\r\nThe first difficulties were in getting lamps, regulators, etc., that\r\nwould give a uniform temperature. This now has been worked out to a\r\npoint where, with any good incubator and an experienced operator,\r\nthe temperature of the egg chamber is readily kept within the\r\ndesired range.\r\n\r\nThese are two principal types of box incubators now in use. In the\r\nearliest of these, the eggs were heated by radiation from a tank of\r\nhot water. These machines depended for ventilation or, what is much\r\nmore important, evaporation, upon chance air currents passing in and\r\nout of augur holes in the ends or bottom of the machine.\r\n\r\nThe second, or more modern type, warms the eggs by a current of air\r\nwhich passes around a lamp flue where, being made lighter by the\r\nexpansion due to heat, the air rises, creating a draft that forces\r\nit into the egg chamber. There it is caused to spread by muslin or\r\nfelt diaphragms so that no perceptible current of air strikes the\r\neggs. This type is the most popular type of small incubator on the\r\nmarket. Its advantage will be more readily seen after the discussion\r\nof the principles of incubation.\r\n\r\nHazy tales of Egyptian incubators have gone the rounds of poultry\r\npapers these many years. More recently some accurate accounts from\r\nAmerican travelers and European investigators have come to light,\r\nand as a result, the average poultry editor is kept busy trying to\r\nexplain how such wonderful results can be obtained \"in opposition to\r\nthe well-known laws of incubation.\"\r\n\r\nThe facts about Egyptian incubators are as follows: They have a\r\ncapacity of 50 to 100 thousand eggs, and are built as a single large\r\nroom, partly underground and made of clay reinforced with straw. The\r\nwalls are two or three feet thick. Inside, the main rooms are little\r\nclay domes with two floors.\r\n\r\nThe hatching season begins the middle of January and lasts three\r\nmonths. A couple of weeks before the hatching begins, the fireproof\r\nhouse is filled with straw which is set afire, thoroughly warming\r\nthe hatchery. The ashes are then taken out and little fires built in\r\npots are set around the outside of the big room. The little clay\r\nrooms with the double floors are now filled with eggs. That is, one\r\nis filled at a time, the idea being to have fresh eggs entering and\r\nchicks moving out in a regular order, so as not to cause radical\r\nchanges in the temperature of the hatchery.\r\n\r\nNo thermometer is used, but the operator has a very highly\r\ncultivated sense of temperature, such as is possessed by a cheese\r\nmaker or dynamite dryer. About the twelfth day the eggs are moved to\r\nthe upper part of the little interior rooms where they are further\r\nremoved from the heated floor. The eggs are turned and tested out\r\nmuch as in this country. They are never cooled and the room is full\r\nof the fumes and smoke of burning straw. The ventilation provided is\r\nincidental.\r\n\r\nThis is about the whole story save for results. The incubator men\r\npay back three chicks for four eggs, and take their profits by\r\nselling the extra chicks that are hatched above the 75 per cent.\r\nThis statement is in itself so astonishing and yet convincing, that\r\nto add that the hatch runs between 85 per cent. and 90 per cent. of\r\nall eggs set, and that the incubators of the Nile Delta hatch about\r\n75,000,000 chicks a year seems almost superfluous. As for the\r\nexplanation of the results of the Egyptian incubators compared with\r\nthe American kerosene lamp type, I think it can best be brought\r\nabout by a consideration in detail of the scientific principles of\r\nincubators.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrinciples of Incubation.\r\n\r\nHEAT.--To keep animal life, once started, alive and growing, we\r\nneed: First, a suitable surrounding temperature. Second, a fairly\r\nconstant proportion of water in the body substance. Third, oxygen.\r\nFourth, food.\r\n\r\nNow, a fertile egg is a living young animal and as such its wants\r\nshould be considered. We may at once dispose of the food problem of\r\nthe unhatched chick, by saying that the food is the contents of the\r\negg at the time of laying, and as far as incubation is concerned, is\r\nbeyond our control.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of external temperature in its relation to life, we\r\nshould note: (A) the optimum temperature; (B) the range of\r\ntemperature consistent with general good health; (C) the range at\r\nwhich death occurs. Just to show the principle at stake, and without\r\nlooking up authorities, I will state these temperatures for a number\r\nof animals. Of course you can dispute the accuracy of these figures,\r\nbut they will serve to illustrate our purpose:\r\n\r\n\r\n                 External  External   External  Internal  Internal\r\n                 Optimum   Healthful   Fatal    Optimum    Fatal\r\n                  Point     Range      Range     Point     Range\r\n\r\n    Man             70    0 to 100   50 to 140     98    90 to 106\r\n\r\n    Dog             60   70 to 140   70 to 140    101    95 to 110\r\n\r\n    Monkey          90   30 to 140   30 to 140    101    95 to 108\r\n\r\n    Horse           80   20 to 120   20 to 120     99    95 to 105\r\n\r\n    Fowl            80   20 to 140   20 to 140    107   100 to 115\r\n\r\n    Newly hatched\r\n    chick           90   70 to 100   40 to 120    108   100 to 115\r\n\r\n    Fertile egg\r\n    at start of\r\n    incubation     103   32 to 110   31 to 125    103    31 to 125\r\n\r\n    Egg incubated\r\n    three days     103   98 to 105   80 to 118     103   95 to 118\r\n\r\n    Egg incubated\r\n    eighteen days  103   75 to 105   50 to 118     106   98 to 116\r\n\r\nThis table shows, among other things, that we are considering in the\r\nchick not a new proposition to which the laws of general animal life\r\ndo not apply, but merely a young animal during the process of growth\r\nto a point where its internal mechanism for heat control, has power\r\nto maintain the body temperature through a greater range of external\r\ntemperature change.\r\n\r\nIn the cooling process that occurs after laying the living cells of\r\nthe egg become dormant, and like a hibernating animal, the actual\r\ninternal temperature can be subjected to a much greater range than\r\nwhen the animal is active. After incubation begins and cell activity\r\nreturns, and especially after blood forms and circulation commences,\r\nthe temperature of the chick becomes subject to about the same\r\ninternal range as with other warm blooded animals.\r\n\r\nIn the case of fully formed animals, the internal temperature is\r\nregulated by a double process. If the external temperature be\r\nlowered, more food substance is combined with oxygen to keep up the\r\nwarmth of the body, while, if the external temperature be raised,\r\nthe body temperature is kept low by the cooling effects of\r\nevaporation. This occurs in mammals chiefly by sweating. Birds do\r\nnot sweat, but the same effect is brought about by increased\r\nbreathing. Now, the chick gradually develops the heat producing\r\nfunction during incubation, until towards the close of the period it\r\ncan take care of itself fairly well in case of lowered external\r\ntemperature. The power to cool the body by breathing is not,\r\nhowever, granted to the unhatched chick, and for this reason the\r\nincubating egg cannot stand excess of heat as well as lack of it.\r\n\r\nThe practical points to be remembered from the above are:\r\n\r\nFirst: Before incubation begins, eggs may be subjected to any\r\ntemperature that will not physically or chemically injure the\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nSecond: During the first few days of the hatch, eggs have no\r\nappreciable power of heat formation and the external temperature for\r\nany considerable period of time can safely vary only within the\r\nrange of temperature at which the physiological process may be\r\ncarried on.\r\n\r\nThird: As the chick develops it needs less careful guarding against\r\ncooling, and must still be guarded against over-heating.\r\n\r\nFourth: It should be remembered, however, that eggs are very poor\r\nconductors of heat, and if the temperature change is not great\r\nseveral hours of exposure are required to bring the egg to the new\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nTemperature is the most readily observed feature about natural\r\nincubation and its control was consequently the first and chief\r\neffort of the early incubator inventors.\r\n\r\nA great deal of experimental work has been done to determine the\r\ndegree of temperature for eggs during incubation. The temperature of\r\nthe hen's blood is about 105 to 107 degrees F. The eggs are not\r\nwarmed quite to this temperature, the amount by which they fail to\r\nreach the temperature of the hen's body depending, of course, upon\r\nthe surrounding temperature. 103 degrees F. is the temperature that\r\nhas been generally agreed upon by incubator manufacturers. Some of\r\nthese advise running 102 degrees the first week, 103 degrees the\r\nsecond, 104 degrees the third. As a matter of fact it is very\r\ndifficult to determine the actual temperature of the egg in the box\r\nincubator. This is because the source of heat is above the eggs and\r\nthe air temperature changes rapidly as the thermometer is raised or\r\nlowered through the egg chamber. The advice to place the bulb of the\r\nthermometer against the live egg is very good, but in practice quite\r\nvariable results will be found on different eggs and different parts\r\nof the machine.\r\n\r\nWith incubators of the same make, and in all appearances identical,\r\nquite marked variation in hatching capacity has been observed in\r\nindividual machines. Careful experimentation will usually show this\r\nto be a matter of the way the thermometer is hung in relation to the\r\nheating surfaces and to the eggs. Ovi-thermometers, which consists\r\nof a thermometer enclosed in the celluloid imitation of an egg, are\r\nnow in the market and are perhaps as safe as anything that can be\r\nused.\r\n\r\nAs was indicated in the previous section greater care in temperature\r\nof the egg is necessary in the first half of the hatch. The\r\ntemperature of 102 degrees F. as above given is, in the writer's\r\nopinion, too low for this portion of the hatch. An actual\r\ntemperature of 104 degrees at the top of the eggs will, as has been\r\nshown by careful experimental work, give better hatches than the\r\nlower temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoisture and Evaporation.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the water content of the egg and its relation to\r\nlife, is the least understood of poultry problems.\r\n\r\nThe whole study of the water content of the egg during incubation\r\nhangs on the amount of evaporation. Now, the rates of evaporation\r\nfrom any moist object is determined by two factors: vapor pressure\r\nand the rate of movement of the air past the object. As incubation\r\nis always carried on at the same temperature, the evaporating power\r\nof the air is directly proportioned to the difference in the vapor\r\npressure of water at that temperature, and the vapor pressure of the\r\nair as it enters the machine. Thus, in order to know the evaporative\r\npower of the air, we have only to determine the vapor pressure of\r\nthe air and to remember that the rate of evaporation is in\r\nproportion to this pressure, i.e.: when the vapor pressure is high\r\nthe evaporation will be slow and the eggs remain too wet, and when\r\nthe vapor pressure is low the eggs will be excessively dried out.\r\n\r\nThe reader is probably more familiar with the term relative humidity\r\nthan the term vapor pressure, but as the actual significance of\r\nrelative humidity is changed at every change in outside temperature,\r\nthe use of this term for expressing the evaporating power of the air\r\nhas led to no end of confusion.\r\n\r\nThe influence of air currents on evaporation is to increase it\r\ndirectly proportional with the rate of air movement. Thus, 10 cubic\r\nfeet of air per hour passing through an egg chamber would remove\r\ntwice as much moisture as would 5 cubic feet.\r\n\r\nIf the percentage of water in any living body be changed a\r\nrelatively small amount, serious disturbances of the physiological\r\nprocesses and ultimately death will result. The mature animal can,\r\nby drinking, take considerable excess of water without danger, for\r\nthe surplus will be speedily removed by perspiration and by the\r\nsecretion from the kidneys. But the percentage of water in the\r\nactual tissues of the body can vary only within a narrow range of\r\nnot more than three or four per cent. The chick in the shell is not\r\nprovided with means of increasing its water content by drinking or\r\ndiminishing it by excretion, but the fresh egg is provided with more\r\nmoisture than the hatched chick will require, and the surplus is\r\ngradually lost by evaporation. This places the water content of the\r\nchick's body at the mercies of the evaporating power of the air that\r\nsurrounds the egg during incubation.\r\n\r\nTo assume that these risks of uncertain rates of evaporation is\r\ndesirable, is as absurd as to assume that the risks of rainfall are\r\ndesirable for plant life. As the plants of a certain climate have\r\nbecome adapted to the amount of soil moisture which the climate is\r\nlikely to provide, so the egg has by natural selection been formed\r\nwith about as much excess of water as will be lost in an average\r\nseason under the natural conditions of incubation. Plant life\r\nsuffers in drought or flood, and likewise bird life suffers in\r\nseasons of abnormal evaporative conditions. This view is\r\nsubstantiated by the fact that the eggs of water fowl which are in\r\nnature incubated in damper places, have a lower water content than\r\nthe eggs of land birds.\r\n\r\nThe per cent. of water contained in the contents of fresh eggs is\r\nabout 74 per cent., or about 65.5 per cent, based on the weight,\r\nshell included. Unfortunately no investigations have been made\r\nconcerning the per cent. of water present in the newly hatched\r\nchick.\r\n\r\nUpon the subject of the loss of water for the whole period of\r\nincubation, valuable data has been collected at the Utah, Oregon and\r\nOntario Experiment Stations.\r\n\r\nIn these tests we find that as a rule the evaporation of eggs under\r\nhens is less than in incubators. With both hens and incubators, the\r\nrate of evaporation is greatest at the Utah Station, which one would\r\nnaturally expect from the climate. The eggs under hens at the\r\nOntario Station averaged about 12 per cent. loss in weight, and\r\nthose at the Utah Station about 15 per cent. At both stations,\r\nincubators without moisture ran several per cent. higher evaporation\r\nthan eggs under hens. The conclusions at all stations were that the\r\naddition of moisture to incubators was a material aid to good\r\nhatches of livable chicks.\r\n\r\nAt Ontario the average evaporation ran from as low as 7 per cent. At\r\nUtah it reached as high as 24 per cent. Now as the entire loss of\r\nweight is loss of water, the solid contents remaining the same, and\r\nas the original per cent, of water contained in the egg (shell\r\nincluded) is only 65.5, the chicks of the two lots with the same\r\namount of solid substance would contain water in the proportion of\r\n58.5 to 41.5. Based on the weight of the chick, this would make a\r\ndifference of water content of over 25 per cent.\r\n\r\nThat human beings or other animals could not exist with such\r\ndifferences in the chemical composition of the body, is at once\r\napparent. In fact I do not believe that the chick can live under\r\nsuch remarkable circumstances. As I have picked the extreme cases in\r\nthe series given, it is possible that these extremes were\r\nexperimental errors, and as in the Utah data, no information is\r\ngiven as what happened to the chicks, I have no proof that they did\r\nlive. But from the large number of hatches that were recorded below\r\n9 per cent, and above 15 per cent., giving a variation of the actual\r\nwater content in the chick's body of about 10 per cent., it is\r\nevident that chicks do hatch under remarkable physiological\r\ndifficulties. One explanation that suggests itself is, that as there\r\nis considerable variation in evaporation of individual eggs due to\r\nthe amount of shell porosity, and the chicks that hatch in either\r\ncase may be the ones whose individual variations threw them nearer\r\nthe normal.\r\n\r\nBy a further study from the Ontario data of the relation of the\r\nevaporation to the results in livable chicks, it can be readily\r\nobserved that all good hatches have evaporation centering around the\r\n12 per cent. moisture loss, and that all lots with evaporations\r\nabove 15 per cent. hatch out extremely poor.\r\n\r\nThe general averages of the machines supplied with some form of\r\nmoisture was 35 per cent. of all eggs set, in chicks alive at four\r\nweeks of age, while the machines ran dry gave only 20 per cent. of\r\nlive chicks at a similar period.\r\n\r\nNow, I wish to call attention to a further point in connection with\r\nevaporation. If the final measure of the loss of weight by\r\nevaporation were the only criterion of correct conditions of\r\nmoisture in the chick's body, the hatches that show 12 per cent., or\r\nwhatever the correct amount of evaporation may be, should be\r\ndecidedly superior to those on either side. That they are better,\r\nhas already been shown. But they are far from what they should be.\r\nAn explanation is not hard to find. The correct content of moisture\r\nis not the only essential to the chick's well being at the moments\r\nof hatching, but during the whole period of incubation. Under our\r\npresent system of incubation, the chick is immediately subject to\r\nthe changing evaporation of American weather conditions. The data\r\nfor that fact, picked at random, will be of interest. The following\r\ntable gives the vapor pressure at Buffalo, N. Y., for twenty\r\nconsecutive days in April:\r\n\r\nApril 1..................170\r\n      2..................130\r\n      3...................95\r\n      4..................103\r\n      5..................110\r\n      6..................106\r\n      7..................154\r\n      8..................183\r\n      9..................245\r\n      10.................311\r\n      11.................342\r\n      12.................286\r\n      13.................219\r\n      14.................248\r\n      15.................217\r\n      16.................193\r\n      17.................241\r\n      18.................306\r\n      19.................261\r\n      20.................204\r\n\r\nSupposing a hatch to be started at the beginning of the above\r\nperiod, by the end of the first week, with the excessive\r\nevaporation, due to a low vapor pressure, the eggs would all be\r\nseveral per cent. below the normal water content; the fact that the\r\nnext week was warm and rainy, and the vapor pressure rose until the\r\nloss was entirely counterbalanced, would not repair the injury, even\r\nthough the eggs showed at the end of incubation exactly the correct\r\namount of shrinkage. A man might thirst in the desert for a week,\r\nthen, coming to a hole of water fall in and drown, but we would\r\nhardly accept the report of a normal water content found at the\r\npost-mortem examination as evidence that his death was not connected\r\nwith the moisture problem.\r\n\r\nThe change of evaporation, due to weather conditions, is, under\r\nhens, less marked than in incubators. This is because there are no\r\ndrafts under the hen, and because the hen's moist body and the moist\r\nearth, if she sets on the ground, are separate sources of moisture\r\nwhich the changing humidity of the atmosphere does not affect. Among\r\nabout forty hens set at different times at the Utah Station and the\r\nloss of moisture of which was determined at three equal periods of\r\nsix days each, the greatest irregularity I found was as follows: 1st\r\nperiod, 5.81 per cent; 2d period, 3.86 per cent; 3d period, 6.15 per\r\ncent. Compare this with a similar incubator record at the same\r\nstation in which the loss for the three periods was 5.63, 9.18 and\r\n2.15.\r\n\r\nI think the reader is now in position to appreciate the almost\r\nunsurmountable difficulties in the proper control of evaporation\r\nwith the common small incubator in our climate. It is little wonder\r\nthat one of our best incubator manufacturers, after studying the\r\nproposition for some time, threw over the whole moisture\r\nproposition, and put out a machine in which drafts of air were\r\nslowed down by felt diaphragms and the use of moisture was strictly\r\nforbidden.\r\n\r\nThe moisture problem to the small incubator operator presents itself\r\nas follows: If left to the mercies of chance and the weather, the\r\ntoo great or too little evaporation from his eggs will yield hatches\r\nthat will prove unprofitable. In order to regulate this evaporation,\r\nhe must know and be able to control both vapor pressure and the\r\ncurrents of air that strike the eggs. Now he does not know the\r\namount of vapor pressure and has no way of finding it out. The\r\nso-called humidity gauges on the market are practically worthless,\r\nand even were the readings on relative humidity accurately\r\ndetermined, they would be wholly confusing, for their effect of the\r\nsame relative humidity on the evaporation will vary widely with\r\nvariations of the out-of-door temperature.\r\n\r\nIf the operator knows or guesses that the humidity is too low, he\r\ncan increase it by adding water to the room, or the egg chamber, but\r\nhe cannot tell when he has too much, nor can he reduce the vapor\r\npressure of the air on rainy days when nature gives him too much\r\nwater. As to air currents he is little better off--he has no way to\r\ntell accurately as to the behavior of air in the egg chamber and\r\nchanges in temperature of the heater or if the outside air will\r\nthrow these currents all off, since they depend upon the draft\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nTaking it all in all, the man with the small incubator had better\r\nfollow the manufacturer's directions and trust to luck.\r\n\r\nThe writer has long been of the conviction that a plan which would\r\nkeep the rate of evaporation within as narrow bounds as we now keep\r\nthe temperature, would not only solve the problem of artificial\r\nincubation, but improve on nature and increase not only the numbers\r\nbut the vitality or livability of the chicks. With a view of\r\nstudying further the relations between the conditions of atmospheric\r\nvapor pressure, and the success of artificial incubation, I have\r\ninvestigated climatic reports and hatching records in the various\r\nsections of the world.\r\n\r\nThe following are averages of the monthly vapor pressures at four\r\npoints in which we are interested:\r\n\r\n              Buffalo,  St. Louis,  San Fran-  Cairo\r\n    Month      N.Y.

As a\r\ngeneral thing they are less extreme in localities when the seasonal\r\nvariations are also less. In Cairo, however, which has a seasonal\r\nvariation greater than San Francisco, the daily variations during\r\nthe hatching season are much less than in California. This is due to\r\na constant wind from sea to land, and an absolute absence of\r\nrainfall, conditions for which Egypt is noted.\r\n\r\nNearness to a coast does not mean uniform vapor pressure, for with\r\nwind alternating from sea to land, it means just the opposite.\r\n\r\nAs will be readily seen the months in spring which give the best\r\nhatches, occupy a medium place in the humidity scale. The fact that\r\nboth hens and machines succeed best in this period, is to me very\r\nsuggestive of the possibility that with an incubator absolutely\r\ncontrolling evaporation, much of the seasonal variation in the\r\nhatchability would disappear.\r\n\r\nThe uniform humidity of the California coast is shown in the above\r\ntable. This is not inconsistent with the excellent results obtained\r\nat Petaluma.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian hatcher in his long experience has learned just about\r\nhow much airholes and smudge fire are necessary to get results. With\r\nthese kept constant and the atmosphere constant, we have more nearly\r\nperfect conditions of incubation than are to be found anywhere else\r\nin the world, and I do not except the natural methods. The climatic\r\nconditions of Egypt cannot be equaled in any other climate, but as\r\nwill be shown in the last section of this chapter, their effect can\r\nbe duplicated readily enough by modern science and engineering.\r\n\r\nMr. Edward Brown, who was sent over here by the English Government\r\nto investigate our poultry industry, was greatly surprised at our\r\npoor results in artificial incubation. Compared with our\r\nacknowledged records of less than 50 per cent. hatches, he quotes\r\nthe results obtained in hatching 18,000 eggs at an English\r\nexperiment station as 62 per cent. I have not obtained any data of\r\nEnglish humidity, but it is undoubtedly more uniform than the\r\neastern United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nVentilation--Carbon Dioxide.\r\n\r\nThe last of the four life requisites we have to consider is that of\r\noxygen. The chick in the shell, like a fish, breathes oxygen which\r\nis dissolved in a liquid. A special breathing organ is developed for\r\nthe chick during its embryonic stages and floats in the white and\r\nabsorbs the oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. The amount of this\r\nbreathing that occurs in the chick is at first insignificant, but\r\nincreases with development. At no time, however, is it anywhere\r\nequal to that of the hatched chicks, for the physiological function\r\nto be maintained by the unhatched chicks requires little energy and\r\nlittle oxidation.\r\n\r\nUpon the subject of ventilation in general, a great misunderstanding\r\nexists. Be it far from me to say anything that will cause either my\r\nreaders or his chickens to sleep less in the fresh air, yet for the\r\nlove of truth and for the simplification of the problem of\r\nincubation, the real facts about ventilation must be given.\r\n\r\nIn breathing, oxygen is absorbed and carbon dioxide and water vapor\r\nare given off. It is popularly held that abundance of fresh air is\r\nnecessary to supply the oxygen for breathing and that carbon dioxide\r\nis a poison. Both are mistakes. The amount of oxygen normally in the\r\nair is about 20 per cent. Of carbon dioxide there is normally three\r\nhundredths of one per cent. During breathing these gasses are\r\nexchanged in about equal volume. A doubling or tripling of carbon\r\ndioxide was formerly thought to be \"very dangerous.\" Now, if the\r\ncarbon dioxide were increased 100 times, we would have only three\r\nper cent., and have seventeen per cent. of oxygen remaining. This\r\noxygen would still be of sufficient pressure to readily pass into\r\nthe blood. We might breathe a little faster to make up for the\r\nlessened oxygen pressure. In fact such a condition of the air would\r\nnot be unlike the effects of higher altitudes.\r\n\r\nSome investigations recently conducted at the U.S. Experiment\r\nStation for human nutrition, have shown the utter misconception of\r\nthe old idea of ventilation. The respiratory calorimeter is an\r\nair-tight compartment in which men are confined for a week or more\r\nat a time while studies are being made concerning heat and energy\r\nyielded by food products. It being inconvenient to analyze such an\r\nimmense volume of air as would be necessary to keep the room\r\nfreshened according to conventional ventilation standards,\r\nexperiments were made to see how vitiated the air could be made\r\nwithout causing ill effects to the subject.\r\n\r\nThis led to a remarkable series of experiments in which it was\r\nrepeatedly demonstrated that a man could live and work for a week at\r\na time without experiencing any ill effects whatever in an\r\natmosphere of his own breath containing as high as 1.86 per cent. of\r\ncarbon dioxide, or, in other words, the air had its impurity\r\nincreased 62 times. This agrees with what every chemist and\r\nphysiologist has long known, and that is that carbon dioxide is not\r\npoisonous, but is a harmless dilutant just as nitrogen. This does\r\nnot mean that a man or animal may not die of suffocation, but that\r\nthese are smothered, as they are drowned, by a real absence of\r\noxygen, not poisoned by a fraction of 1 per cent. of carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\nIn the same series of experiments, search was made for the\r\nmysterious poisons of the breath which many who had learned of the\r\nactual harmlessness of carbon dioxide alleged to be the cause of the\r\nill effects attributed to foul air. Without discussion, I will say\r\nthat the investigators failed to find such poisons, but concluded\r\nthat the sense of suffocation in an unventilated room is due not to\r\ncarbon dioxide or other \"poisonous\" respiratory products, but is\r\nwholly due to warmth, water vapor, and the unpleasant odors given\r\noff by the body.\r\n\r\nThe subject of ventilation has always been a bone of contention in\r\nincubator discussions. With its little understood real importance,\r\nas shown in the previous section, and the greatly exaggerated\r\npopular notions of the importance of oxygen and imagined poisonous\r\nqualities of carbon dioxide, the confusion in the subject should\r\ncause little wonder.\r\n\r\nA few years ago some one with an investigating mind decided to see\r\nif incubators were properly ventilated, and proceeded to make carbon\r\ndioxide determinations of the air under a hen and in an incubator.\r\nThe air under the hen was found to contain the most of the obnoxious\r\ngas. Now, this information was disconcerting, for the hen had always\r\nbeen considered the source of all incubator wisdom. Clearly the\r\nperfection of the hen or the conception of pure air must be\r\nsacrificed. Chemistry here came to the rescue, and said that carbon\r\ndioxide mixed with water, formed an acid and acid would dissolve the\r\nlime of an egg shell. Evidently the hen was sacrificing her own\r\nhealth by breathing impure air in order to soften up the shells a\r\nlittle so the chicks could get out. Since it could have been\r\ndemonstrated in a few hours in any laboratory, that carbon dioxide\r\nin the quantities involved, has no perceptible effect upon egg\r\nshells, it is with some apology that I mention that quite a deal of\r\ngood brains has been spent upon the subject by two experiment\r\nstations. The data accumulated, of course, fails to prove the\r\ntheory, but it is interesting as further evidence of the\r\nneedlessness in the old fear of insufficient ventilation.\r\n\r\nAt the Ontario Station, the average amounts of carbon dioxide under\r\na large number of hens was .32 of one per cent., or about ten times\r\nthat of fresh air, or one-sixth of that which the man breathed so\r\nhappily in the respiratory calorimeter. With incubators, every\r\nconceivable scheme was tried to change the amount of carbon dioxide.\r\nIn some, sour milk was placed which, in fermenting, gives off the\r\ngas in question. Others were supplied with buttermilk, presumably to\r\nfamiliarize the chickens with this article so they would recognize\r\nit in the fattening rations. In other machines, lamp fumes were run\r\nin, and to still others, pure carbon dioxide was supplied. The\r\npercentage of the gas present varied in the machines from .06 to .58\r\nof one per cent. The results, of course, vary as any run of hatches\r\nwould. The detailed discussion of the hatches and their relation to\r\nthe amount of carbon dioxide as given in Bulletin 160 of the Ontario\r\nStation, would be unfortunately confusing to the novice, but would\r\nmake amusing reading for the old poultryman. Speaking of a\r\ncomparison of two hatches, the writer, on page 53 of the bulletin\r\nsays, \"The increase in vitality of chicks from the combination of\r\nthe carbon dioxide and moisture over moisture only, amounting, as it\r\ndoes, to 4.5 per cent. of the eggs set, seems directly due to the\r\nhigher carbon dioxide content.\" I cannot refrain from suggesting\r\nthat if my reader has two incubators, he might set up a Chinese\r\nprayer machine in front of one and see if he cannot in like manner\r\ndemonstrate the efficacy of Heavenly supplications in the hatching\r\nof chickens.\r\n\r\nThe practical bearing of the subject of ventilation in the small\r\nincubator is almost wholly one of evaporation. The majority of such\r\nmachines are probably too much ventilated. In a large and properly\r\nconstructed hatchery, such as is discussed in the last section of\r\nthis chapter, the entire composition of the air, as well as its\r\nmovement, is entirely under control. Nothing has yet been brought to\r\nlight that indicates any particular attention need be given to the\r\ncomposition of such air save in regard to its moisture content, but\r\nas the control of this factor renders it necessary that the air be\r\nin a closed circuit, and not open to all out-doors, it will be very\r\neasy to subject the air to further changes such as the increasing\r\noxygen, if such can be demonstrated to be desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurning Eggs.\r\n\r\nThe subject of turning eggs is another source of rather meaningless\r\ncontroversy. Of course, the hen moves her eggs around and in doing\r\nso turns them. Doubtless the reader, were he setting on a pile of\r\ndoor knobs as big as his head, would do the same thing. As proof\r\nthat eggs need turning, we are referred to the fact that yolks stick\r\nto the shell if the eggs are not turned. I have candled thousands of\r\neggs and have yet to see a yolk stuck to the shell unless the egg\r\ncontained foreign organism or was several months old. However, I\r\nhave seen hundreds of blood rings stuck to the shell. Whether the\r\nchick died because the blood rings stuck or whether the blood rings\r\nstuck because the chicken died I know not, but I have a strong\r\npresumption that the latter explanation is correct, for I see no\r\nreason if the live blood ring was in the habit of sticking to the\r\nshell, why this would not occur in a few hours as well as in a few\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1901 I saw plenty of chicks hatched out in Kansas in egg\r\ncases, kitchen cupboards and other places where regular turning was\r\nentirely overlooked.\r\n\r\nMr. J.P. Collins, head of the Produce Department of Swift & Co.,\r\nsays that he was one time cruelly deserted in a Pullman smoker for\r\ntelling the same story. The statement is true, however, in spite of\r\nMr. Collins' unpleasant experience. Texas egg dealers frequently\r\nfind hatched chickens in cases of eggs.\r\n\r\nUpon the subject of turning eggs the writer will admit that he is\r\ndoing what poultry writers as a class do on a great many occasions,\r\ni.e.: expressing an opinion rather than giving the proven facts. In\r\nincubation practice it is highly desirable to change the position of\r\neggs so that unevenness in temperature and evaporation will be\r\nbalanced. When doing this it is easier to turn the eggs than not to\r\nturn them, and for this reason the writer has never gone to the\r\ntrouble of thoroughly investigating the matter. But it has been\r\nabundantly proven that any particular pains in egg turning is a\r\nwaste of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCooling Eggs.\r\n\r\nThe belief in the necessity of cooling eggs undoubtedly arose from\r\nthe effort to follow closely and blindly in the footsteps of the\r\nhen. With this idea in mind the fact that the hen cooled her eggs\r\noccasionally led us to discover a theory which proved such cooling\r\nto be necessary. A more reasonable theory is that the hen cools the\r\neggs from necessity, not from choice. In some species of birds the\r\nmale relieves the female while the latter goes foraging.\r\n\r\nBut there is no need to argue the question. Eggs will hatch if\r\ncooled according to custom, but that they will hatch as well or\r\nbetter without the cooling is abundantly proven by the results in\r\nEgyptian incubators where no cooling whatever is practiced.\r\n\r\n\r\nSearching for the \"Open Sesame\" of Incubation.\r\n\r\nThe experiment station workers have, the last few years, gone a\r\nhunting for the weak spot in artificial incubation. Some reference\r\nto this work has already been made in the sections on moisture and\r\nventilation. Before leaving the subject I want to refer to two more\r\nefforts to find this key to the mystery of incubation and in the one\r\ncase at least correct an erroneous impression that has been given\r\nout.\r\n\r\nAt the Ontario Station a patent disinfectant wash called \"Zenoleum\"\r\nwas incidentally used to deodorize incubators. Now, for some reason,\r\nperhaps due to the belief that white diarrhoea was caused by a germ\r\nin the egg, this idea of washing with Zenoleum was conceived to be a\r\npossible solution of the incubator problem. In the numerous\r\nexperiments at that station in 1907 Zenoleum applied to the machine\r\nin various ways was combined with various other incipient panaceas\r\nand at the end of the season the results of the various combinations\r\nwere duly tabulated. The machine with buttermilk and Zenoleum headed\r\nthe list for livable chicks.\r\n\r\nFor reasons explained in the chapter on \"Experiment Station Work,\"\r\nthe idea of contrasting the results of one hatch with one sort with\r\nthe average results of many hatches of another sort is very poor\r\nscience. Feeling that the Station men would hardly be guilty of\r\nexpressing as they did in favor of such a method without better\r\nreason, I very carefully went over the results and compared all\r\nmachines using Zenoleum with all machines without it. The results in\r\nfavor of Zenoleum were less marked but still perceptible. I was\r\nsomewhat puzzled, as I could see no rational explanation of the\r\nrelation between disinfecting incubator walls and the hatchability\r\nof the chick in its germ-proof cage. Finally I hit upon the scheme\r\nof arranging the hatches by dates and the explanation became at once\r\napparent. The hatching experiments had extended from March to July,\r\nbut the Zenoleum hatches were grouped in April and early in May,\r\nwhen, as one would expect from weather conditions, all hatches were\r\nrunning good. After allowing for this error Zenoleum appeared as\r\nharmless and meaningless as would the Attar of Roses.\r\n\r\nThe second link after the missing link of incubation to which I wish\r\nto call your attention also occurred at the Ontario Station. The\r\nlatter case, however, is happier in that no unwarranted conclusions\r\nwere drawn and that an interesting bit of scientific knowledge was\r\nadded to the world's store. The conception to be tested was an\r\noffshoot from the carbon dioxide theory. You will remember at the\r\nUtah Station the idea was that carbon dioxide was to dissolve the\r\nshell so the chick could break out easier.\r\n\r\nAt the Guelph Station the conception was that the carbon dioxide\r\nmight dissolve the lime of the shell for the chick to use in \"makin'\r\nhisself.\" As an egg could not be analyzed fresh and then hatched, a\r\nnumber were analyzed from the same hens and others from those hens\r\nwere then incubated with the various amounts of carbon dioxide,\r\nbuttermilk, Zenoleum, and other factors. The lime content of the\r\ncontents of the fresh egg averaged about .04 grams. At hatching time\r\nthe lime in the chick's body averaged about .20 grams and was always\r\nseveral times as great as the maximum of the eggs.\r\n\r\nClearly calcium phosphate of the chick's bones is made by the\r\ndigestion of the calcium carbonate from the shell and its\r\ncombination with the phosphorus of the yolk. Certainly a remarkable\r\nand hitherto unexplained fact. The amount of lime required is not\r\ngreat enough, however, to materially weaken the shell, but, of\r\ncourse, the process is vital to the chick as bones are quite\r\nessential to his welfare, but it is an \"inside affair\" of which the\r\nthree-tenths of one per cent of carbon dioxide incidentally present\r\nunder the hen is entirely irrelevant.\r\n\r\nA further observation made by the investigator is that the chicks\r\nwhich obtained the lowest amount of lime were abnormally weak. As\r\nlong as we are powerless to aid the chick in digesting lime this\r\nfact, like the other, belongs in the field of pure, rather than\r\napplied science. I think that we are safe in saying that the\r\nweakness caused the shortage of lime rather than vice versa; if the\r\nwriter remembers runts in other animals are usually a little short\r\nof bone material.\r\n\r\nThe chemist of the station is to be given special credit for not\r\njumping at conclusions. In the summary of this work he states:\r\n\"There is apparently no connection between the amount of lime\r\nabsorbed by the chick and the amount of carbon dioxide present\r\nduring incubation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Box Type of Incubator In Actual Use.\r\n\r\nAlthough the fact is not so advertised and frequently not recognized\r\neven by the makers, the success of existing incubators is directly\r\nproportional to the extent with which they control evaporation. In\r\norder to show this I have only to call attention briefly to two or\r\nthree of the most successful types of incubators on the market.\r\n\r\nLet me first repeat that evaporation increases with increased air\r\ncurrents and with decreased vapor pressure. Now, the vapor pressure\r\nundergoes all manner of changes with the passing of storm centers\r\nand the changes of prevailing winds. But there is a general tendency\r\nfor vapor pressure to increase with increase in outside temperature.\r\nNow, the movement of air in all common incubators depends upon the\r\ndraft principle and the greater the difference in machine\r\ntemperature and outside temperature the greater will be this draft.\r\nThus, we have two factors combining to cause variation in the rate\r\nof evaporation. The tendency for the rate of airflow to vary is\r\ndiminished when a cellar is used for an incubator room, but the\r\ncellar does not materially remedy the climatic variation in vapor\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nThe general tendency of incubators as ordinarily constructed, is to\r\ndry out the eggs too rapidly. With a view of counteracting this,\r\nwater is placed in pans in the egg room. A surface of water exposed\r\nto quiet air does not evaporate as fast as one might think, as is\r\neasily shown by the fact that air above rivers, lakes and even seas\r\nis frequently far from the saturation point. The result of the\r\nmoisture pan with a given current of air is that the vapor pressure\r\nis increased a definite amount, but by no means is it regulated or\r\nmade uniform. Inasmuch as too much shrinking is the most prevalent\r\nfault in box incubators, the use of moisture is on the whole\r\nbeneficial, but in hot, murky weather, with less circulation and\r\nhigher outside vapor pressure, the moisture is overdone and the\r\noperator condemns the system.\r\n\r\nThe subject not being clearly understood and no means being\r\navailable for vapor pressure determinations, the system results in\r\nconfusion and disputes. When the felt diaphragm machine was brought\r\ninto the market it was advertised as a no-moisture machine. The\r\nresult of the diaphragm is that of choking off air movement and\r\nconsequently reducing evaporation. This gives exactly the same\r\nresults as the use of moisture, but the machine is easier to operate\r\nand seemed to do away with the vexatious moisture problem which,\r\ntogether perhaps, with some fancied resemblance of felt diaphragms\r\nto hen feathers, has resulted in the widespread use of this type of\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nThe latest effort along the lines of reducing evaporation is the\r\nsand tray machine that followed in the wake of the Ontario\r\ninvestigation. This device simply gives a greater evaporating\r\nsurface to the water and hence a greater addition to the vapor\r\npressure. The results in practice I had given me by a man who last\r\nyear hatched sixty-five thousand chicks and as many more ducklings.\r\n\r\nHe said: \"The sand tray early in the season gave the best hatches\r\nand most vigorous chicks we had, but later on things got too wet and\r\nthe chickens drowned.\" No nicer demonstration of science in practice\r\ncould be desired.\r\n\r\nIn the present-day incubator of either type we are wholly at the\r\nmercy of sudden climatic changes of vapor pressure. For the slower\r\nchanges from season to season some control by greater and less\r\namounts of supplied moisture, or by ventilator slides is available,\r\nbut little understood and seldom practiced.\r\n\r\nIt will certainly be of interest to my readers to know the actual\r\nhatches obtained with the prevailing type of box incubator. By\r\nactual hatches we mean the per cent. of live chicks taken out of the\r\nmachine to the per cent. of eggs put in. The ordinary published\r\nhatches, based on one per cent. of fertile hatches, are a delusion\r\nand a snare. When eggs are tested out many dead germs come out with\r\nthem and the separation of microscopic dead germs from the infertile\r\negg is, of course, impossible. Such padded and show hatching records\r\ndo not interest us.\r\n\r\nWhere incubators are run on top of the ground I have found the\r\nresults to be poor and to improve, the bigger and deeper and damper\r\nand warmer and less ventilated the cellar is made. The reason for\r\nthis is plain. In such a cellar the vapor pressure of the air is not\r\nonly greater but is less influenced by the shifting vapor pressure\r\nof the outside air. In a good cellar the operator, though his\r\nknowledge of the factors with which he deals is grievously\r\ndeficient, learns, through long and costly experience, about what\r\naddition of moisture or about what rate of ventilation will give him\r\nthe best results. In the room more subject to outside influences,\r\nthe conditions are so constantly changing that uniformity of\r\npractice never gives uniform results, and hence the operator is\r\nwithout guidance, either intelligent or blind, and the results are\r\nwholly a product of chance.\r\n\r\nAs proof of my contention I may give results of a series of full\r\nseason hatches for 1908, each involving several thousand eggs.\r\n\r\nFirst, a state experiment station, the name of which I do not care\r\nto publish. Incubators kept in a cement basement which has flues in\r\nwhich fires were built to secure \"ample ventilation.\" This caused a\r\nstrong draft of cold, dry air, making the worst possible condition\r\nfor incubation. The hatch for the season averaged 25 per cent. and\r\nwas explained by lack of vitality in the stock.\r\n\r\nSecond, Ontario Agricultural College. A room above ground, moisture\r\nused in most machines and various other efforts being made to\r\nimprove the hatches by a staff of half a dozen scientists. Results:\r\nHatch 48 per cent.--incubator manufacturers call the experimenters\r\nnames and say they are ignorant and prejudiced.\r\n\r\nThird, Cornell University: dry ventilated basement representing\r\ntypical conditions of common incubator practice of the country.\r\nResults: Hatch 52 per cent., results when given out commonly based\r\non fertile eggs and every one generally pleased.\r\n\r\nFourth: One of the most successful poultrymen in New York State, who\r\nhas, without knowing why, hit upon the plan of using a no-moisture\r\ntype of incubator in a basement which is heated with steam pipes,\r\nwhich maintains temperature at 70 degrees and has a cement floor\r\nwhich is kept covered with water. Results: Hatch 59 per cent.\r\n\r\nFifth: As a fifth in such a series I might mention again the\r\nEgyptian machine with the uniform vapor pressure of the climate and\r\nthe three chicks exchanged for four eggs.\r\n\r\nWhile an official in the United States Department of Agriculture, I\r\ngathered data from original records of private plants covering the\r\nincubation of several hundred thousand eggs. Such information was\r\nfurnished me in confidence as a public official and as a private\r\ncitizen I have no right to publish that which would mean financial\r\nprofit or loss to those concerned.\r\n\r\nOf records where there were ten thousand or more eggs involved, the\r\nlowest I found was 44 per cent. and the highest, that mentioned as\r\nthe fourth case above, or 59 per cent. The great majority of these\r\nrecords hung very closely around the 50 per cent. mark.\r\n\r\nThe following is a fair sample of such data. It is the record\r\nof hatching hen eggs for the first six months of 1908, at one\r\nof the largest poultry plants in America:\r\n\r\n                Eggs      Chicks      Per Cent.\r\n    Month        Set      Hatched      Hatched\r\n\r\n    January    4,213       1,585        37 2-3\r\n    February   6,275       2,339        33 3-4\r\n    March     17,990       6,993        38 1-3\r\n    April     18,819      10,265        54 1-2\r\n    May       24,458      14,438        59\r\n    June      13,100       6,614        55\r\n              ------      ------        ------\r\n    Total     84,855      42,234        50 p.c.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Future Method of Incubation.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the mammoth incubator which would hatch eggs by the\r\nhundred thousand and a minimum of expense is the dream of the\r\nAmerican incubator inventor. We have long had available such methods\r\nof insulation and regulating the supply of heat as would point to\r\nthe practicability of such a dream.\r\n\r\nThe past efforts in this direction have fallen down for the\r\nfollowing simple reason: All eggs were placed in a single big room\r\nwith a view of the man's entering the room to take care of them.\r\nContact with cold walls, the opening of doors, the hatching of\r\nchicks or introduction of fresh eggs set up air currents, the hot\r\nair rising and the cold air settling until great differences in\r\ntemperature would be found in the room. No systematic regulation of\r\nevaporation was contemplated, as the principles at stake or the\r\nmeans of such regulation were unknown.\r\n\r\nThe attempt just referred to was made several years ago by one of\r\nthe most successful of incubator manufacturers and because of his\r\nfailure other inventors were inclined to steer clear of the\r\nproposition. Meanwhile the need of such an incubator has grown\r\nenormously. At the time that above effort was made no duck ranch\r\nexisted whose annual production ran over thirty or forty thousand\r\nducklings, whereas we now have several in the one hundred thousand\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nMuch more remarkable has been the growth of the day-old chick\r\nbusiness. The discovery that newly hatched chicks could be\r\nsuccessfully shipped hundreds of miles with less loss than shipping\r\neggs for hatching, has resulted in a few years' time in the growth\r\nof hatcheries of considerable size where chicks are hatched by means\r\nof common incubators. Still another opportunity for the use of large\r\nhatcheries has been by the growth of poultry communities. There are\r\nother communities besides those mentioned in this book which would\r\namply support public hatcheries. If half the poultry growers of\r\nLancaster County, Pa., were to be prevailed upon to patronize a\r\npublic hatchery, the county would support between fifteen and twenty\r\n100,000 egg incubators. Any of the numerous trolley centers in\r\nIndiana, Ohio and Southern Michigan would likewise be profitable\r\nlocations for the establishment of public hatcheries.\r\n\r\nThe demand for the incubator of large capacity has, within the last\r\nyear or so, brought two or three \"mammoth\" incubators into the\r\nmarket. The devices I now refer to consist of a row of box\r\nincubators which, instead of being heated by single lamps, are\r\nheated by continuous hot water pipes. This scheme effects a\r\nconsiderable saving in fuel cost and labor, but the bulkiness of\r\nconstruction and the woeful lack of evaporation control are still to\r\nbe dealt with.\r\n\r\nThe writer now wishes briefly to describe the plan of construction\r\nand operation of a new type of hatchery, the success of which has\r\nrecently been made feasible by inventions and technical knowledge\r\nhitherto unavailable. The plan of the hatchery is on that of a cold\r\nstorage plant as far as insulation and general construction go. The\r\neggs are kept in bulk in special cases which are turned as a whole\r\nand may rest on either of four sides. At hatching time the eggs are\r\nspread out in trays in a special hatching room, which is only large\r\nenough to accommodate chicks to the amount of one-sixth of the\r\nincubator capacity, for twice a week deliverings, or one-third if\r\nweekly deliveries are desired.\r\n\r\nThere are no pipes or other sources of heat in the egg chambers. All\r\ntemperature regulation is by means of air heated (or cooled as the\r\ncase may be) outside of the egg rooms and forced into the egg rooms\r\nby a motor driven cone fan, maintaining a steady current of air, the\r\nrate of movement of which may be varied at will. The air movement\r\nmaintained will always be sufficiently brisk, however, to prevent an\r\nunevenness of temperature in different parts of the room.\r\n\r\nSo simple is this that the reader will doubtless wonder why it was\r\nnot developed earlier. The reason is that air subject to the\r\nclimatic influences will, with any forced draft sufficient to\r\nequalize temperature, result in a fatal rate of evaporation.\r\nSprinkling the air has not generally been thought practical because\r\nof the notion that air must not be used in the egg chamber but once,\r\nwhich involved quite a waste of heat necessary in warming a large\r\nbulk of air and evaporating sufficient water. Moreover, no means\r\nhas, in the past, been available for making a sufficiently accurate\r\nmeasurement of the evaporating power of the air.\r\n\r\nThe hair hygrometers commonly sold to incubator operators are known\r\nby scientists to be absolutely unreliable. The range between the wet\r\nand dry bulb thermometers was found in the Ontario experiments to\r\ngive readings with and without fanning that varied 15 to 20 per\r\ncent. in relative humidity which, at the temperature of an egg\r\nchamber, would amount to a variation of three to four hundred of\r\nvapor pressure units, which, with the forced draught plan, would\r\nruin a hatch of eggs in a few hours. The sling psychrometer as used\r\nby the U.S. Weather Bureau should, in the hands of an expert, give\r\nresults making possible measurements accurate to two or three per\r\ncent. of relative humidity or forty to sixty units of vapor\r\npressure. In contrast with these blundering instruments we now have\r\navailable an instrument with which the writer has frequently\r\ndetermined vapor pressure accurately to within a range of two or\r\nthree vapor pressure units and the instrument is capable of being\r\nconstructed for even finer work.\r\n\r\nAs it is only by means of air with the moisture content absolutely\r\ncontrolled that the use of a large room becomes possible, we can now\r\nsee why this type of hatching remained so long undeveloped. By means\r\nof such vapor pressure control the large egg chamber is not only\r\nfeasible but the rate of evaporation at once becomes subject to the\r\ncontrol of the operator and we achieve a perfection in artificial\r\nincubation hitherto unattained.\r\n\r\nThe means by which the air moisture is regulated is similar to that\r\nused in up-to-date cold storage plants where the air is made moist\r\nby sprinkling and dried with deliquescent salts. The regulation of\r\nvapor pressure, like that of temperature, may be by electrically\r\nmoved dampers which switch a greater or less proportion of the\r\nincoming current to the sprinkler or dryer as the case may be. The\r\nordinary incubator thermostat gives the necessary impulse for the\r\ncontrol of the temperature dampers, while the instrument above\r\nreferred to is used for the vapor pressure control.\r\n\r\nAs the entire air circuit is closed, the chemical composition of the\r\nair may also be regulated at will. This results in a reduction of\r\nthe quantity of heat required to a minimum; in fact, with the\r\nincubator in full swing, the air will, at times, need cooling rather\r\nthan warming.\r\n\r\nThe question of the cost of incubation by this method, or of profit\r\nof such a hatchery operated for the public is almost wholly one of\r\nthe size of operations. Where sufficient eggs may be obtained and\r\nsufficient demand exists for the chicks to make it profitable to\r\noperate, the additional cost of hatching extra chicks will be\r\ninsignificant compared with the present system.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian poultryman gives four eggs for three chicks, but the\r\nAmerican poultryman would be willing to give four eggs for one\r\nchick, as is shown by the fact that he sells eggs for from 1 to 3\r\ncents apiece and buys day-old chicks for ten to fifteen cents. A\r\nplant with a seasonable capacity of 100,000 eggs has a basis to work\r\nupon something as follows:\r\n\r\nWith a fifty per cent. hatch and chicks at 10 cents each there would\r\nbe a gross income of $5,000 annually. From this we must subtract for\r\neggs at 2 cents each, $2,000. Salary for operator $1,000, wages for\r\nhelper $300. Fuel, supplies and repairs $500. Cost of delivery and\r\nsales of chicks $200. This leaves a residue of $1,000, which would\r\npay a 20 per cent. interest on the necessary investment of $5,000.\r\nPersonally, I think this is about the minimum unit of hatching that\r\nwould prove worth while as independent institutions.\r\n\r\nAny increase in the percentage of the hatch would, of course, reduce\r\nthe unit of size necessary for profitable operation. Upon a single\r\npoultry plant as a duck farm the cost of operation would be\r\nmaterially reduced, as the operator himself would take the place of\r\nthe intelligent manager and the cost of gathering eggs and the\r\ndelivery of the product would be eliminated.\r\n\r\nThe most profitable method of hatchery operation undoubtedly will be\r\nupon a plan analogous to what, in creamery operation, is called\r\ncentralization. The success of this scheme depends upon the fact\r\nthat transportation and agencies at country stores are relatively\r\nless important items of expense than plant construction and high\r\nsalaries for skilled labor. A hatchery with a million capacity can\r\nbe built and run at not more than twice the cost of one\r\nhundred-thousand plant and better men can be kept in charge of it. A\r\nportion of the saving will of course be expended in maintaining a\r\nsystem of buying eggs and selling chicks.\r\n\r\nThe material advantage of operating a hatchery in connection with a\r\nhigh-class egg handling and poultry packing establishment, or as one\r\nfeature of a poultry community, is at once apparent, for the system\r\nof collecting the market produce will be utilized for gathering eggs\r\nand distributing chicks, each business helping the other.\r\n\r\nThe public hatchery also gives an excellent opportunity for the\r\nintroduction of good stock among farmers who would be too shiftless\r\nto acquire it by ordinary methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nFEEDING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old adage that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing is\r\nnowhere better illustrated than in the scientific phases of poultry\r\nfeeding. The attempted application of the common theoretical feeding\r\nstandards to poultry has caused not only a great waste of time but\r\nhas also resulted in expenditures for high-priced feeds when cheaper\r\nfeeds would have given as good or better results.\r\n\r\nThe so-called science of food chemistry is really a rough\r\napproximation of things about which the actual facts are unknown.\r\nSuch knowledge bears the same relation to accurate science as the\r\nmaps of America drawn by the early explorers do to a modern atlas.\r\nLike these early efforts of geography the present science of food\r\nchemistry is all right if we realize its incompleteness. In\r\npractice, the poultryman, after a general glance at the \"map,\" will\r\nfind a more reliable guide in simpler things.\r\n\r\nI am writing this book for the poultryman, not the professor, and\r\nbecause I state that the particular kind of science wherein the\r\nprofessor has taken the most pains to teach the poultryman is\r\ncomparatively useless, I fear it may arouse a mistrust of the value\r\nof science as a whole. I know of no way to prevent this except to\r\npoint out the distinction between scientific facts and guesses\r\ncouched in scientific language.\r\n\r\nWhen a scientist states that a hen cannot lay egg shells containing\r\ncalcium without having calcium in her food, that is a fact, and it\r\nworks out in practice, for calcium is an element, and the hen cannot\r\ncreate elementary substances. When the same scientist, finding that\r\nan egg contains protein, says that wheat is a better egg food than\r\ncorn because it has the largest amount of protein, that is a guess\r\nand does not work in practice because protein is not a definite\r\nsubstance, but the name of a group of substances of which the\r\nscientist does not know the composition, and which may or may not be\r\nof equal use to the hen in the formation of eggs.\r\n\r\nAll substances of which the world is made are composed of elements\r\nwhich cannot be changed. When these elements are combined they form\r\ndefinite substances with definite proportions entirely independent\r\nof the original elements. The pure diamond is carbon. Gasoline is\r\ncarbon and hydrogen. Several hundred other things are also carbon\r\nand hydrogen. Sugar is carbon combined with hydrogen and oxygen.\r\nThese three elements make several thousand different substances,\r\nincluding fats, alcohol and formaldehyde. Hydrocyanic acid is carbon\r\ncombined with hydrogen and nitrogen, and is the most deadly poison\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nThe failure of food science is partly because we do not know the\r\ncomposition of many of the substances of food and partly because\r\nthese substances are changed in the animal body in a manner which we\r\ndo not understand and cannot control.\r\n\r\n\r\nConventional Food Chemistry\r\n\r\nThe conventional analysis of feeding stuff divides the food\r\nsubstances in water, carbohydrates, fat, protein and ash. The amount\r\nof water in the body is all-important, but, with the exception of\r\neggs during incubation, I confess I prefer to rely upon the\r\nchicken's judgment as to the amount required.\r\n\r\nThe carbohydrate group contains starch, sugar, cellulose and a\r\nnumber of other things. Carbohydrates constitute two-thirds to\r\nthree-fourths of all common rations and nine-tenths of that amount\r\nis starch. The proposition of how much carbohydrates the hen eats is\r\nchiefly determined by the quantity of grain she consumes.\r\n\r\nOf fats there are many kinds of which the composition is definitely\r\nknown. The amount of fats the hen eats is unimportant because she\r\nmakes starch into fat. The protein or nitrogen containing substances\r\nof the diet is the group of food substances over which most of the\r\ntheories are expounded. The hen can make egg fat from corn starch or\r\ncabbage leaves because they contain the same elements. She cannot\r\nmake egg white from starch or fat because the element of nitrogen\r\nwhich is in the egg white is lacking in the starch and fats.\r\n\r\nThe substances that have nitrogen in them are called protein. They\r\nare very complex and difficult to analyze. In digestion these\r\nproteins are all torn to pieces and built up into other kinds of\r\nprotein. Just as in tearing down an old house, only a portion of the\r\nmaterial can be used in a new house, so it is with protein and\r\nlaboratory analysis cannot tell us how much of the old house can be\r\nutilized in building the new one.\r\n\r\nIn practice the whole subject simmers down to the proposition of\r\nfinding out by direct experiment whether the hen will do the work\r\nbest on this or that food, irregardless of its nitrogen content as\r\ndetermined in the laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe results of many experiments and much experience has shown that\r\nlean meat protein will make egg protein and chicken flesh protein\r\nand that vegetable protein pound for pound is not its equal. I know\r\nof no results that have proven that the high priced vegetable foods\r\nsuch as linseed meal, gluten feed, etc., have proven a more valuable\r\nchicken food than the cheapest grains.\r\n\r\nWith cows and pigeons this is not the case, but the hen is not a\r\nvegetarian by nature and high priced vegetable protein doesn't seem\r\nto be in her line. Of the three standard grains there is some\r\nindication of the value of the proteids for chickens and of the\r\nfollowing ranks, 1st oats, 2d corn, 3d wheat.\r\n\r\nThe false conceptions of the value of wheat proteids has been\r\nspecially the cause of much waste of money. Digestive trials and\r\ndirect experiments both show that, as chicken foods, wheat is worth\r\nless, pound for pound, than corn and yet, though much higher in\r\nprice, it is still used not only as a variety grain, but by many\r\npoultrymen as the chief article of diet. Wheat contains only 3 per\r\ncent. more proteid than corn. The man who substitutes wheat at one\r\nand one-half cents a pound for corn worth one cent a pound pays 17\r\ncents a pound for his added protein. In beef scrap he could get the\r\nprotein for 5 cents a pound and have a very superior article\r\nbesides.\r\n\r\nMilk as a source of protein ranks between the vegetable proteids and\r\nthose of meat. It is preferably fed clabbered. The dried casein\r\nrecently put on the market is a valuable food but is not worth as\r\nmuch as meat food and will not be extensively utilized until the\r\ndemand for meat scrap forces up the price to a point where the\r\ncasein can be sold more cheaply. Meat scrap, to be relished by the\r\nchickens, must not be a fine meal, but should consist of particles\r\nthe size of wheat kernels or larger. The fine scrap gives the\r\nmanufacturer a chance to utilize dried blood and tankage which is\r\ncheaper in quality and price than particles of real meat.\r\n\r\nThe last and least understood of the groups of food substances is\r\nmineral substance or ash. Now, the chemist determines mineral\r\nsubstance by burning the food and analyzing the residue. In the\r\nintense heat numerous chemical changes take place and the substances\r\nthat come out of the furnace are entirely different from those\r\ncontained in the fresh food.\r\n\r\nThe lay reader will probably ask why the chemist does not analyze\r\nthe substances of the fresh material. The answer is that he doesn't\r\nknow how. Progress is made every year but the whole subject is yet\r\ntoo much clouded in obscurity to be of any practical application. At\r\npresent the feeding of mineral substance, like the feeding of\r\nprotein, can best be learned by experimenting directly with the\r\nfoods rather than by attempting to go by their chemical composition.\r\n\r\nIn practice it is found that green feed supplies something which\r\ngrain lacks, presumably mineral salts. Moreover we know that such\r\nfood fed fresh is superior to the same substance dried. This may be\r\nbecause of chemical changes that occur in curing or simply because\r\nof greater palatability.\r\n\r\nThe other chief source of mineral matter is meat preparations with\r\nor without ground bone. Recent experiments at Rhode Island have\r\nattempted to show the relative value of the mineral constituents of\r\nmeat by adding bone ash to vegetable proteids, as linseed and gluten\r\nmeal. The results clearly indicate that mineral matter of animal\r\norigin greatly improves the value of the vegetable diet, but that\r\nthe latter is still sadly deficient. Of course the burning process\r\nused in preparing the bone ash may have destroyed some of the\r\nvaluable qualities of the mineral salts. Practically, we do not care\r\nwhether the value of animal meal be due to protein, mineral salts or\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nIn time the world will become so thickly populated that we cannot\r\nafford to rear cattle and condemn a portion of the carcass to go\r\nthrough another life cycle before human consumption. By that time\r\nthe necessary food salts will doubtless be known and we will be able\r\nto medicate our corn and alfalfa and do away with the beef scrap.\r\nThe poultrymen will do well, however, not to count on the chemistry\r\nof the future, for the chemist that makes the \"tissue salts\" for the\r\nhen may manufacture human food with Niagara power and fresh eggs\r\nwill come in tin cans.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow the Hen Unbalances Balanced Rations.\r\n\r\nLet the poultryman who figures the nutritious ratio of chicken feed\r\ntry this simple experiment. Place before a half dozen newly hatched\r\nchicks a feed of one of the commercial chick feeds. When they have\r\nhad their fill, sacrifice these innocents on the altar of science\r\nand open their crops. He will find that one chick has eaten almost\r\nexclusively of millet seed, another has preferred cracked corn,\r\nanother has filled up heavily on bits of beef scrap and mica crystal\r\ngrit, while a fourth fancied oats and granulated bone. In short the\r\nchick has, in three minutes, unbalanced the balanced ration that it\r\ntook a week to figure out. This experiment can be varied by placing\r\nhens in individual coops and setting before each weighed portions of\r\nevery food in the poultryman supply man's catalogue.\r\n\r\nThere is only one kind of feeding that will balance rations and that\r\nis to feed exclusively on wet mash. This is successfully done in the\r\nduck business, but the duck is a Chinese animal and his ways are not\r\nthe ways of the more fastidious hen.\r\n\r\nIn dairy work the individual preferences of the cows are given\r\nattention and their whimsy catered to by the herdsman. I know of\r\nnothing that makes a man more feel his kinship to the beast than to\r\nhear a good dairyman talk of the personalities and preferences of\r\nhis feminine co-operators.\r\n\r\nWith commercial chicken work, humanly guided individual feedings is\r\nout of the question, though, if used, it might hasten the coming of\r\nthe two-egg-per-day hen. Individual feeding with the hen as sole\r\njudge as to what she shall eat, which means each food in separate\r\nhoppers and free range, is the best system of chicken feeding yet\r\nevolved.\r\n\r\nThe duty of the poultryman is to supply the food, giving enough\r\nvariety to permit of the hens having a fair selection. In practice\r\nthis means that every hen must have access to water, grit\r\n(preferably oyster shell), one kind of grain, one kind of meat, and\r\none kind of green food. In practice it will pay to add granulated\r\nbone for growing stock. One or two extra grains for variety and as\r\nmany green foods as conveniences will permit to increase\r\npalatability--hence increase the amount of food consumed, for a\r\nheavy food consumption is necessary for egg production.\r\n\r\nAs corn is the cheapest food known, let it be the bread at the\r\nboarding house and other grains the rotating series of hash, beans\r\nand bacon. The grain hopper may have two divisions. The corn never\r\nchanges but the other should have a change of grain occasionally.\r\nThe extent of the use made of the various grains will be determined\r\nby their price per pound.\r\n\r\nThe proportions of food of the various classes that will be consumed\r\nis about as follows:\r\n\r\nOf 100 lbs. of dry matter: 8 to 12 lbs. meat; 66 to 75 lbs. grain;\r\n15 to 25 lbs. green food.\r\n\r\nThe profits of the business will be increased by supplying the green\r\nfood in such tempting forms as to increase the amount consumed and\r\ncut down the use of grains.\r\n\r\nThe methods we have been describing in which various dry unground\r\ngrains, beef scrap and oyster shell, each in a separate compartment,\r\nare exposed before the hen at all times, together with the abundant\r\nuse of green food, either as pasture or a soiling crop, is the\r\nmethod of feeding assumed throughout this book.\r\n\r\nThe hopper feeding of so-called dry mash or ground grain mixture has\r\nbeen quite a fad in the last few years. The tendency of the hens to\r\nwaste such food has occasioned considerable trouble. They are\r\npicking it over for their favorite foods and trying to avoid\r\ndisagreeable foods. This difficulty is relieved when the food be\r\nseparated into its various components and the hen offered each\r\nseparately. As a matter of fact, there is no occasion for feeding\r\nground feed except in fattening rations and here the wet mash is\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\nThe use of the products of wheat milling has been the chief excuse\r\nfor such practices, but unless these get considerably lower in price\r\nper pound than corn they may be left off the bill-of-fare to\r\nadvantage. The great use made of these products in poultry feeding\r\nwas chiefly a result of the attempted application of the balanced\r\nration idea, but as has already been shown the efforts to raise the\r\nprotein ratio with grain foods is generally false economy.\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned wet mash which the writer does not recommend\r\nbecause of the labor involved, is, nevertheless, a fairly profitable\r\nmethod of poultry feeding. It is used in the Little Compton district\r\nof Rhode Island and was also used in the famous Australian egg\r\nlaying contests elsewhere described. Personally I would prefer\r\nfeeding ground grain wet, especially wheat bran and middlings, to\r\nfeeding it dry.\r\n\r\nThe scattering of grain in litter so generally recommended in\r\npoultry literature is all right and proper, but is rather out of\r\nplace in commercial poultry farming. It is used on the large poultry\r\nplants with the yards and long houses, but is not used on colony\r\nfarms or in any of the poultry growing communities. I should\r\nrecommend littered houses for Section 6 and the northern half of\r\nSection 3 (see Chapter IV), but with warmer soils and climate where\r\nthe snow does not lie on the ground it would add a labor expense\r\nthat would very seriously handicap the business.\r\n\r\nThe systems of poultry feeding that are commonly advertised are\r\nbased either on some patent nostrum or a recommendation of green\r\nfood in novel form, such as sprouted oats. The joke about poultry\r\nfeed at 10 cents a bushel, absurd though it may seem, has caught\r\nlots of dollars. To take a bushel of oats worth 50 cents, add water,\r\nlet them sprout and have five bushels costing 10 cents, is certainly\r\na wonderful achievement in wealth getting. The only reason a man\r\ncouldn't run a soup kitchen on the same principle is that he can't\r\ndo a soup business by mail. Sprouted oats are a good green food,\r\nhowever, though somewhat laborious to prepare. I should certainly\r\nrecommend them if for any reason the regular green food supply\r\nshould run out.\r\n\r\nThe points already mentioned are about all the practical suggestions\r\nthat the science of animal nutrition has to offer the poultryman.\r\nThe discussion of feeding from its technical viewpoint is\r\nsufficiently covered in the chapter on \"Farm Poultry\" and the\r\ndiscussion of the management and economics of various types of\r\npoultry production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nDISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the study of the classification and description of the numerous\r\nailments by which individual fowls pass to their untimely end, I\r\nrecommend any of the numerous books written upon the subject. Some\r\nof these works are more accurate than others, but that I consider\r\nimmaterial. The study of these diseases is good for the poultryman,\r\nit gives his mind exercise. When a boy in high school I studied\r\nLatin for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nDon't Doctor Chickens.\r\n\r\nFor the cure of all poultry diseases when they have passed a point\r\nwhen the fowl does not eat or for other reasons recovery is\r\nimprobable, I recommend a blow on the head--the hatchet spills the\r\nblood which is unwise.\r\n\r\nThe usual formula of \"burn or bury deeply\" is somewhat troublesome,\r\nunless you have a furnace running. A covered pit is more convenient\r\nif far enough removed from the house that the odor is not\r\nprohibitive. A post with a tally card may be planted near by. This\r\npart of the poultry farm may be marked \"Exhibit A,\" and shown first\r\nto the visitor during the busy season. If he is one of those\r\nprospective pleasure and profit poultrymen who propose to disregard\r\nall facts of biology and economics of production, you may save\r\nyourself the trouble of showing him the rest of the plant.\r\nUnfortunately, this scheme is not open to the poultryman who has\r\nbreeding stock for sale.\r\n\r\nI have frequently had the question put to me in the smoker of a\r\nPullman car, \"Do not epidemic diseases make the poultry business\r\nprecarious?\" Such questions came from farm-raised men, but not from\r\npoultry farmers. Poultrymen should figure a certain loss of birds\r\njust as insurance companies figure on the human death rate, but to\r\nall practical intents and purposes the epidemic disease has been\r\nbanished from the poultry farms and seldom if ever enters the\r\nrecords in answer to the question, \"Why do poultry farms fail?\"\r\n\r\nSome of my readers may take exception to me either in regard to roup\r\nor white diarrhoea. Roup is a disease of the wrong system and\r\ncareless management. White diarrhoea, so-called, is a matter of\r\nwrong incubation.\r\n\r\nThe high mortality of young chicks, though not an epidemic disease,\r\nshares with excessive cost of production, very much of the\r\nresponsibility for poultry farm failures. At the present writing the\r\npoultry editors of the country are having much discussion over the\r\nconclusion of Dr. Morse of the Bureau of Animal Industry to the\r\neffect that white diarrhoea is caused by an intestinal parasite\r\nsimilar to the germ that causes human dysentery. Dr. Morse's\r\nopportunities for investigation have been somewhat limited and as\r\nthe intestines of any animal are always swarming with various\r\norganisms, it will take very conclusive evidence to prove that the\r\ndoctor is right. Practically the naming of the germs that attend the\r\nfuneral is not particularly important for the reason that it has\r\nbeen thoroughly demonstrated that with good parentage, good\r\nincubation and good brooder conditions, white diarrhoea is unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Causes of Poultry Diseases.\r\n\r\nPoultry ailments are assignable to one of the three following\r\ncauses, or a combination of these: First, hereditary or inborn\r\nweakness; second, unfavorable conditions of food, surroundings,\r\netc.; third, bacteria or animal parasites.\r\n\r\nA great many chickens die while yet within the shell, or during the\r\ngrowing process, there being no assignable reason save that of\r\ninherited weakness. To this class of troubles the only remedy is to\r\nbreed from better stock. It is as much the trait of some birds to\r\nproduce infertile eggs or chicks of low vitality as it is for others\r\nto produce vigorous offspring.\r\n\r\nThe second class of ailments needs no discussion save that accorded\r\nit under the general discussions of the method of conducting the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThe third class of ailments includes the contagious diseases. It is\r\nnow believed that most common diseases are caused by microscopic\r\ngerms known as bacteria. These germs in some manner gain entrance to\r\nthe body of an animal, and, growing within the tissues, give off\r\npoisonous substances known as toxins, which produce the symptoms of\r\nthe disease. The ability to withstand disease germs varies with the\r\nparticular animal and the kind of disease. As a general rule it may\r\nbe stated that disease germs cannot live in the body of a perfectly\r\nvigorous and healthy animal. It is only when the vitality is at a\r\nlow ebb, owing to unfavorable conditions or inherited weakness, that\r\ndisease germs enter the body and produce disease.\r\n\r\nThe bacteria which cause disease, like other living organisms, may\r\nbe killed by poisoning. Such poisons are known as disinfectants. If\r\nit were possible to kill the bacteria within the animal, the curing\r\nof disease would be a simple matter, but unfortunately the common\r\nchemical poisons that kill germs kill the animal also. The only\r\nthing that can be relied upon to kill disease germs within the\r\nanimal, is a counter-poison developed by the animal itself and known\r\nas anti-toxin. Such anti-toxins can be produced artificially and are\r\nused to combat certain diseases, as diphtheria and small-pox in\r\nhuman beings and blackleg in cattle. Such methods of combating\r\npoultry diseases have not been developed, and due to the small value\r\nof an individual fowl would probably not be commercially useful even\r\nif successful from a scientific standpoint. The only available\r\nmethod of fighting contagious diseases of poultry is to destroy the\r\ndisease germs before they enter the fowls and to remove the causes\r\nwhich make the fowl susceptible to the disease.\r\n\r\nContagious diseases of poultry may be grouped into two general\r\nclasses: First, those highly contagious; second, those contracted\r\nonly by fowls that are in a weakened condition. To the first class\r\nbelong the severe epidemics, of which chicken-cholera is the most\r\ndestructive.\r\n\r\n\r\nChicken-Cholera.\r\n\r\nThe European fowl-cholera has only been rarely identified in this\r\ncountry. Other diseases similar in symptoms and effect are confused\r\nwith this. As the treatment should be similar the identification of\r\nthe diseases is not essential.\r\n\r\nYellow or greenish-colored droppings, listless attitude, refusal of\r\nfood and great thirst are the more readily observed symptoms. The\r\ndisease runs a rapid course, death resulting in about three days.\r\nThe death rate is very high. The disease is spread by droppings and\r\ndead birds, and through feed and water. To stamp out the disease\r\nkill or burn or bury all sick chickens, and disinfect the premises\r\nfrequently and thoroughly. A spray made of one-half gallon carbolic\r\nacid, one-half gallon of phenol and twenty gallons of water may be\r\nused. Corrosive sublimate, 1 part in 5000 parts of water, should be\r\nused as drinking water. This is not to cure sick birds, but to\r\nprevent the disease from spreading by means of the drinking vessels.\r\nFood should be given in troughs arranged so that the chickens cannot\r\ninfect the food with the feet. All this work must be done\r\nthoroughly, and even then considerable loss can be expected before\r\nthe disease is stamped out. If cholera has a good start in a flock\r\nof chickens it will often be better to dispose of the entire flock\r\nthan to combat the disease. Fortunately cholera epidemics are rare\r\nand in many localities have never been known.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoup.\r\n\r\nThis disease is a representative of that class of diseases which,\r\nwhile being caused by bacteria, can be considered more of a disease\r\nof conditions than of contagion. Roup may be caused by a number of\r\ndifferent bacteria which are commonly found in the air and soil.\r\nWhen chickens catch cold these germs find lodgment in the nasal\r\npassages and roup ensues. The first symptoms of roup are those of an\r\nordinary cold, but as the disease progresses a cheesy secretion\r\nappears in the head and throat. A wheezing or rattling sound is\r\noften produced by the breathing. The face and eyes swell, and in\r\nsevere cases the chicken becomes blind. The most certain way of\r\nidentifying roup is a characteristic sickening odor. The disease may\r\nlast a week or a year. Birds occasionally recover, but are generally\r\nuseless after having had roup.\r\n\r\nSick birds should be removed and destroyed, but the time usually\r\nspent in doctoring sick birds and disinfecting houses can in this\r\ncase be better employed in finding and remedying the cause of the\r\ndisease. Such causes may be looked for as dampness, exposure to cold\r\nwinds, or to a sudden change in temperature as is experienced by\r\nchickens roosting in a tight house. Fall and winter are the seasons\r\nof roup, while it is poorly housed and poorly fed flocks that most\r\ncommonly suffer from this disease. Flocks that have become\r\nthoroughly roupy should be disposed of and more vigorous birds\r\nsecured. The open front house has proved to be the most practical\r\nscheme for the reduction of this disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nChicken-Pox, Gapes, Limber Neck.\r\n\r\nChicken-pox or sore-head is a disease peculiar to the South. It\r\nattacks growing chickens late in the summer. Southern poultrymen who\r\ngive reasonable attention to their stock, find that, while this\r\ndisease is a source of some annoyance, the losses are not severe and\r\nthat it may be readily controlled. In the first place, the animal\r\nepidemic of pox can be practically avoided by bringing the chicks\r\nout early in the season. If the disease does develop in the flock,\r\nthe birds are taken from the coops at night and their heads dipped\r\nin a proper strength of one of the coal tar disinfectants. Such\r\ntreatment once a week has generally been effective. This disease is\r\nan exception to the general rule that disinfectants which kill germs\r\nalso kill the chicken. The explanation is that chicken-pox is an\r\nexternal disease.\r\n\r\nGapes is given in every poultry book as one of the prominent poultry\r\ndiseases, but are not common in the Northern and Western States.\r\nGapes are caused by a parasitic worm in the windpipe. Growing chicks\r\nare affected. The remedy is to move the chicks to fresh ground and\r\ncultivate the old.\r\n\r\nLimber neck is not a disease, but is the result of the fowl's eating\r\nmaggots from dead carcasses. It can be prevented by not allowing\r\ndead carcasses to remain where the chickens will find them. No\r\npractical cure is known.\r\n\r\n\r\nLice and Mites.\r\n\r\nThe parasites referred to as chicken-lice include many different\r\nspecies, but in habit they may be classed as body-lice and\r\nroost-mites. The first, or true bird-lice, live on the body of the\r\nchicken and eat the feathers and skin. The roost-mite is similar to\r\na spider and differs in habits from the body-louse in that it sucks\r\nthe blood of the chicken and does not remain on the body of the fowl\r\nexcept at night.\r\n\r\nBody-lice are to be found upon almost all chickens, as well as on\r\nmany other kinds of birds. Their presence in small numbers on\r\nmatured fowls is not a serious matter. When body-lice are abundant\r\non sitting hens they go from the hen to the newly hatched chickens,\r\nand may cause the death of the chicks. The successful methods of\r\ndestroying body-lice are three in number: First, dust or earth\r\nwallows in which the active hens will get rid of lice. Such dust\r\nbaths should be especially provided for yarded chickens and during\r\nthe winter. Dry earth can be stored for this purpose. Sitting hens\r\nshould have access to dust baths. Second: The second method by which\r\nbody-lice may be destroyed is the use of insect powder. The\r\npyrethrum powder is considered the best for this purpose, but is\r\nexpensive and difficult to procure in the pure state. Tobacco dust\r\nis also used. Insect powder is applied by holding the hen by the\r\nfeet and working the dust thoroughly into the feathers, especially\r\nthe fluff. The use of insect powder should be confined to sitting\r\nhens and fancy stock, as the cost and labor of applying is too great\r\nfor use upon the common chicken. The third method is suitable for\r\nyoung chickens, and consists of applying some oil and grease on the\r\nhead and under the wings. Do not grease the chick all over. With\r\nvigorous chickens and correct management the natural dust bath is\r\nall that is needed to combat the lice.\r\n\r\nThe roost-mite is probably the cause of more loss to farm poultry\r\nraisers than any other pest or disease. The great difficulty in\r\ndestroying mites on many farms is that chickens are allowed to roost\r\nin too many places. If the chicken-house proper is the only building\r\ninfected with mites the difficulty of destroying them is not great.\r\nPlainness in the interior furnishings of the chicken-house is also a\r\ngreat advantage when it comes to fighting mites. The mites in the\r\ndaytime are to be found lodged in the cracks near the roosting-place\r\nof the chickens.\r\n\r\nMites can be killed with various liquids, the best in point of\r\ncheapness is boiling water. Give the chicken-house a thorough\r\ncleaning and scald by throwing dippers of hot water in all places\r\nwhere the mites can find lodgment. Hot water destroys the eggs as\r\nwell as the mites. Whitewash is a good remedy, as it buries both\r\nmites and eggs beneath a coating of lime from which they cannot\r\nemerge. Pure kerosene or a solution of carbolic acid in kerosene, at\r\nthe rate of a pint of acid to a gallon of oil, is an effective\r\nlice-paint. Another substance much used for destroying insects or\r\nsimilar pests is carbon bisulphide. This is a liquid which\r\nevaporates readily, the vapor destroying the insects or mites.\r\nCarbon bisulphide or other fumigating agents are not effective in\r\nthe average chicken-house because the house cannot be tightly\r\nclosed. The liquid lice-killers on the market are very effective.\r\nThey are usually composed of the remedies just mentioned, or of\r\nsomething of similar properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nPOULTRY FLESH AND POULTRY FATTENING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe poultry flesh which is used for food may be grouped into three\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\nFirst: Poultry carcasses grown especially for market.\r\n\r\nSecond: Poultry carcasses consisting of hens and young male birds\r\nthat are sold from the general farms where the pullets are kept for\r\negg production.\r\n\r\nThird: The cockerels and old hens sold as a by-product from egg\r\nfarms.\r\n\r\nThe third class hardly needs our consideration in the present\r\nchapter. This stock, usually Leghorns, like Jersey veal, is to be\r\ndisposed of at whatever price the market offers.\r\n\r\nThe cockerel will, if growing nicely, be fairly plump and the hens,\r\nif on hopper rations of corn and beef scrap, will be about as fat as\r\nthey can be profitably made, and to waste further effort upon them\r\nwould not pay. Leghorn cockerels and hens are a wholesome enough\r\nmeat, but will never command fancy prices nor warrant extra pains.\r\n\r\nIn class two we find the great mass of the poultry flesh of the\r\ncountry. This stock consisting chiefly, as it does, of Plymouth\r\nRocks and Wyandottes, is well worth some extra pains toward\r\nincreasing its quantity and quality.\r\n\r\nWithin the last ten or fifteen years several changes have been\r\nbrought about in the general methods of handling farm poultry.\r\nFormerly it was thought desirable to market all stock not kept as\r\nlayers while in the broiler stage of from 1-1/2 to 2 pounds. Since\r\nthe introduction of the custom of holding fall broilers over in cold\r\nstorage, the price has fallen until it is now more profitable to\r\nmarket the surplus cockerels from the farm at three or four months\r\nof age. At this period the flesh has cost less per pound to produce\r\nthan at either an earlier or later stage. For such purposes only the\r\nwell fleshed type of American breeds has been found desirable. The\r\nLeghorns and similar breeds are too small and become staggy too\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\nContrary to a common belief and to the custom in the poultry books\r\nof classifying the Asiatics as meat breeds, the Brahmas and Cochins\r\nare among the very poorest fowls that can be used for farm\r\nproduction of poultry meat. At the age spoken of these breeds are\r\nlanky and unsightly and not wanted by poultry packers.\r\n\r\nConsecutively with and perhaps responsible for change of sentiment\r\nthat demands that broilers be allowed to grow into four pound\r\nchickens, we find the development of the crate fattening industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrate-Fattening.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of crate-fattening into the Central West occurred\r\nabout 1900. The credit of this introduction belongs to the large\r\nmeat packing firms. At the present time the business is not confined\r\nto the meat packers, but is shared by independent plants throughout\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThe plants of the West range from a few hundred to as high as 20,000\r\ncapacity. They are constructed for convenience and a saving of\r\nlabor, and in this respect are decidedly in advance of the European\r\nestablishments where fattening has been long practiced.\r\n\r\nThe room used for fattening is well built and sanitary. A good\r\nsystem of ventilation is essential, as murky, damp air breeds colds\r\nand roup. The coops are built back to back, and two or more coops in\r\nheight. Each coop is high and wide enough to comfortably accommodate\r\nthe chickens, and long enough to contain from five to twelve\r\nchickens. The chickens stand on slats, beneath which are\r\ndropping-boards that may be drawn out for cleaning. The\r\ndropping-boards and feeding-troughs are often made of metal. Strict\r\ncleanliness is enforced. No droppings or feed are allowed to\r\naccumulate and decompose.\r\n\r\nAs is a general rule in meat production, young animals give much\r\nbetter returns for food consumed than do mature individuals. With\r\nthe young chicken the weight is added as flesh, while the hen has a\r\ntendency, which increases with age, to turn the same food into\r\nuseless fat. For this reason the general practice is to fatten only\r\nthe best of the young chickens. The head feeder at a large and\r\nsuccessful poultry plant gave the following information on the\r\nselection of birds for the fattening-crates:\r\n\r\n\"The younger the stock the more profitable the gain. All specimens\r\nshowing the slightest indication of disease are discarded. The\r\nPlymouth Rock is the favorite breed, and the Wyandotte is second.\r\nLeghorns are comparatively fat when received, and, while they do\r\nwell under feed and 'yellow up' nicely, they do not gain as much as\r\nthe American breeds. Black chickens are not fed at all. Brahmas and\r\nCochins are not considered good feeders at the age when they are\r\ncommonly sold. Chickens in fair flesh at the start make better gains\r\nthan those that are extremely lean or very fat. But, contrary to\r\nwhat the amateur might assume, the moderately fat chicken will\r\ncontinue to make fair gains, while the very lean chicken seldom\r\nreturns a profit.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea has been somewhat prevalent that there is some guarded\r\nsecret about the rations used in crate-fattening. This is a mistaken\r\nnotion. The rations used contain no new or wonderful constituent,\r\nand although individual feeders may have their own formulas, the\r\ngeneral composition of the feed is common knowledge. The feed most\r\ncommonly used consists of finely ground grain, mixed to a batter\r\nwith buttermilk or sour skim-milk. The favorite grain for the\r\npurpose is oats finely ground and the hulls removed. Oats may be\r\nused as the sole grain, and is the only grain recommended as\r\nsuitable to be fed alone. Corn is used, but not by itself. Shorts,\r\nground barley or ground buckwheat are sometimes used. Beans, peas,\r\nlinseed and gluten meals may be used in small quantities. When milk\r\nproducts are obtainable they are a great aid to successful\r\nfattening. Tallow is often used in small quantities toward the\r\nfinish of the feeding period. The assumption is that it causes the\r\ndeposit of fat-globules throughout the muscular tissues, thus adding\r\nto the quality of the meat. The following simple rations show that\r\nthere is nothing complex about the crate-fed chicken's bill of fare:\r\n\r\nNo. 1.--Ground oats, 2 parts; ground barley, 1 part; ground corn, 1\r\npart; mixed with skim-milk.\r\n\r\nNo. 2.--Ground corn, 4 parts; ground peas, 1 part; ground oats, 1\r\npart; meat-meal, 1 part; mixed with water.\r\n\r\nA ration used by some fatters with great success is composed of\r\nsimply oatmeal and buttermilk.\r\n\r\nThe feed is given as a soft batter and is left in the troughs for\r\nabout thirty minutes, when the residue is removed. Chickens are\r\ngenerally fed three times per day. Water may or may not be given,\r\naccording to the weather and the amount of liquid used in the food.\r\n\r\nThe chicken that has been crate-fattened has practically the same\r\namount of skeleton and offal as the unfattened specimen, but carries\r\none or two pounds more of edible meat upon its carcass. Not only is\r\nthe weight of the chicken and amount of edible meat increased, but\r\nthe quality of the meat is greatly improved, consisting of juicy,\r\ntender flesh. For this reason the crate-feeding process is often\r\nspoken of as fleshing rather than as fattening.\r\n\r\nThe enforced idleness causes the muscular tissue to become tender\r\nand filled with stored nutriment. The fatness of a young chicken,\r\ncrate-fed on buttermilk and oatmeal, is a radically different thing\r\nfrom the fatness of an old hen that has been ranging around the\r\ncorn-crib.\r\n\r\nThe crate-fattening industry while deserving credit for great\r\nimprovement in the quality of chicken flesh in the regions where it\r\nhas been introduced, cannot on the whole be considered a great\r\nsuccess. It is commonly reported that some of the firms instrumental\r\nin its introduction lost money on the deal. The crate-fattening\r\nplant has come to stay in the communities where careful methods of\r\npoultry raising are practiced, and where the stock is of the best,\r\nbut when a plant is located in a newly settled region where the\r\npoultry stock is small and feed scarce, the venture is pretty apt to\r\nprove a fiasco.\r\n\r\nWhile poultryman at the Kansas Experiment Station, the writer made a\r\nlarge number of individual weighings of fowls in the crates of one\r\nof the large fattening plants of the state.\r\n\r\nThese weighings pointed out very clearly why the expected profits\r\nhad not been realized. The birds selected for weighing were all\r\nfine, uniform looking Barred Rock Cockerels. At the end of the first\r\nweek they were found to still appear much the same, but when handled\r\na difference was easily noticed. By the end of the second week a few\r\nbirds had died and many others were in a bad way. The individual\r\nchanges of weight ran from 2-1/2 pounds gain to 3/4 pound loss, and\r\nmany of the lighter birds were of very poor appearance. It is simply\r\na matter of forced feeding being a process that makes trouble with\r\nthe health of the chicken if all is not just right.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that in the future more fattening will be done on the\r\nfarm, or by the farmer operating in a small way among his neighbors.\r\nThe reason for this is that the saving of labor in the large plant\r\nis hardly as great as the added loss from the shrinkage of the birds\r\ndue to the excitement of shipping and crowding, and the introduction\r\nof disease by the mingling of chickens from so many different\r\nsources.\r\n\r\nThe Canadians especially have encouraged fattening on the farm. The\r\nfollowing is a hand-bill gotten out by an enterprising Canadian\r\ndealer for distribution among the farmers of his locality:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO FATTEN CHICKENS FOR THE EXPORT TRADE.\r\n\r\nTo fatten birds for the export trade, it is necessary\r\nto have proper coops to put them in. These should be\r\ntwo feet long, twenty inches high and twenty inches\r\ndeep, the top, bottom and front made of slats. This\r\nsize will hold four birds, but the cheapest plan is to\r\nbuild the coops ten feet long and divide them into five\r\nsections.\r\n\r\nWhat to feed.\r\n\r\nOats chopped fine, the coarse hulls sifted out, two\r\nparts; ground buckwheat, one part; mix with skim-milk\r\nto a good soft batter, and feed three times a day.\r\nOr, black barley and oats, two parts oats to one part\r\nbarley. Give clean drinking water twice a day, grit\r\ntwice a week, and charcoal once a week. During the\r\nfirst week the birds are in the coops they should be\r\nfed sparingly--only about one-half of what they will\r\neat. After that gradually increase the amount until\r\nyou find out just how much they will eat up clean\r\neach time. Never leave any food in the troughs, as\r\nit will sour and cause trouble. Mix the food always\r\none feed ahead. Birds fed in this way will be ready\r\nfor the export trade in from four to five weeks.\r\nChickens make the best gain put in the coop weighing\r\nthree to four pounds.\r\n\r\nWe Supply the Coops.\r\n\r\nWe have on hand a number of coops for fattening\r\nchicks, which we will loan to any person, \"free of\r\ncharge\", who will sign an agreement to bring all\r\nchicks fattened in them to us. Every farmer should\r\nhave at least one of these coops, as this is the only\r\nway to fatten chicks properly. In this way you can\r\nget the highest market price. We can handle any\r\nquantity of chicks properly fatted.\r\n                                  ARMSTRONG BROS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe farmer who does not think it worth while to construct\r\nfattening-crates for his own crop of chickens, may get very fair\r\nresults by simply enclosing the chickens in some vacant shed. To\r\nthese may feed a ration of two-thirds corn meal and one-third\r\nshorts, or some of the more complicated rations used at the\r\nfattening plants may be fed.\r\n\r\nIn the East, poultry fattening on the general farm is not dissimilar\r\nfrom the practices in the Central West, but we find a larger use of\r\ncramming machines, caponizing, and the growing of chickens for meat\r\nas an industry independent of keeping hens for egg production.\r\n\r\nThe cramming machine is a device by means of which food in a\r\nsemi-liquid state is pumped into the bird's crop, through a tube\r\ninserted in the mouth. This means of feeding is much more used in\r\nEurope than in this country. It requires good stock and careful\r\nworkmen. The method will probably slowly gain ground in this\r\ncountry. The feed used in cramming is similar to that used in\r\nordinary crate feeding, except that it is mixed as a thin batter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaponizing.\r\n\r\nCaponizing is the castration of male chickens. Capons hold the same\r\nplace in the poultry market as do steers in the beef market.\r\n\r\nCaponizing is practiced to quite an extent in France, and to a less\r\ndegree in England and the United States.\r\n\r\nMuch the larger part of the industry is confined to that portion of\r\nthe United States east of Philadelphia, though increasing numbers of\r\ncapons are being raised in the North Central States. During the\r\nwinter months capon is regularly quoted in the markets of the larger\r\neastern cities. Massachusetts and New Jersey are the great centers\r\nfor the growing of capons, while Boston, New York, and Philadelphia\r\nare the great markets. In many eastern markets the prices paid for\r\ndressed capons range from 20 to 30 cents a pound. The highest prices\r\nusually prevail from January to May, and the larger the birds the\r\nmore they bring a pound.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of caponizing is not, as is sometimes stated, to\r\nincrease the size of the chicken, but to improve the quality of the\r\nmeat. The capon fattens more readily and economically than other\r\nbirds. As they do not interfere with or worry one another, large\r\nflocks may be kept together.\r\n\r\nThe breeds suitable for caponizing are the Asiatics and Americans.\r\nBrahmas will produce, with proper care and sufficient time, the\r\nlargest and finest capons. On the ordinary farm, where capons would\r\nbe allowed to run loose, Plymouth Rocks would prove more profitable.\r\nPlymouth Rocks, Brahmas, Langshans, Wyandottes, Indian Games, may\r\nall be used for capons. Leghorns are not to be considered for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nCapons should be operated upon when they are about ten weeks or\r\nthree months old and weigh about two pounds.\r\n\r\nThe operation of caponizing is performed by cutting in between the\r\nlast two ribs. Both testicles may be removed from one side or both\r\nsides may be opened. The cockerel should be starved for twenty-four\r\nhours in order to empty the intestines. Asiatics are more difficult\r\nto operate on than Americans, the testicles being larger and less\r\nfirm. There is always some danger of causing death by tearing blood\r\nvessels, but the per cent. of loss with an experienced operator is\r\nvery small. Loss by inflammation is still more rare. The testicle of\r\na bird is not as highly developed as in a mammal, and if the organ\r\nis broken and a small fragment remains attached it will produce\r\nbirds known as slips. Some growers advise looking over the capons\r\nand puncturing the wind puffs that gather beneath the skin. This,\r\nhowever, is not necessary.\r\n\r\nA good set of tools is indispensable and can be purchased for from\r\n$2 to $3. As a complete set of instructions is furnished with each\r\nset it is unnecessary to go into details here. The beginner should,\r\nhowever, operate on several dead cockerels before attempting to\r\noperate on a live one.\r\n\r\nAfter caponizing the bird should be given plenty of soft feed and\r\nwater. The capon begins to eat almost immediately after the\r\noperation is performed, and no one would suppose that a radical\r\nchange had taken place in his nature.\r\n\r\nThe feeding of capons differs little from the feeding of other\r\ngrowing chickens. Corn, wheat, barley and Kaffir-corn would be\r\nsuitable grain, while beef-scrap would be necessary to produce the\r\nbest growth.\r\n\r\nAbout three weeks before marketing place the capons in small yards\r\nand feed them three or four times a day, giving plenty of corn and\r\nother feed, or fatten them in one of the ways indicated in the\r\nsection on fattening poultry. Corn meal and ground oats, equal parts\r\nby weight, moistened with water or milk, make a good mash for\r\nfattening capons.\r\n\r\nIn dressing capons leave the head and hackle feathers, the feathers\r\non the wings to the second joint, the tail feathers, including those\r\na little way up the back, and the feathers on the legs halfway up to\r\nthe thigh. These feathers serve to distinguish capons from other\r\nfowls in the market. Do not cut the head off, for this is also a\r\ndistinguishing feature of the capon, on account of the undeveloped\r\ncomb and wattles.\r\n\r\nThe price received for capons is greater than any other kind of\r\npoultry meat except early broilers. There may be trouble in some\r\nlocalities in getting dealers to recognize capons as such and pay an\r\nadvanced price.\r\n\r\nOn several farms in Massachusetts, 500 to 1,000 capons are raised\r\nannually, and on one farm 5,000 cockerels are held for caponizing.\r\nThe industry is growing rapidly year by year and the supply does not\r\nequal the demand.\r\n\r\nIt is to be expected that the amount of caponizing done in the West\r\nwill gradually increase. Those wishing to try the growing of capons\r\nwill do well to secure an experienced operator. Good men at this\r\nwork receive five cents per bird. Poor operators are dear at any\r\nprice, as they produce a large number of worthless slips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nMARKETING POULTRY CARCASSES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the marketing of poultry carcasses as in other phases of the\r\nindustry, we really have two systems to discuss. The one is used for\r\nthe marketing of the product of the farm of the Central West, and\r\nthe other the product of the poultryman or eastern farmer, who is\r\nnear a large market and who will be repaid for taking special pains\r\nin preparing his poultry for market.\r\n\r\n\r\nFarm-Grown Chickens.\r\n\r\nAt the present time almost the entire poultry crop of the Central\r\nWest is sold from the farm as live poultry. This farm stock is\r\npurchased by produce buyers or general merchants and shipped to the\r\nnearest county seat or other important town, where there are usually\r\none or more poultry-killing establishments. These establishments may\r\nvary from a simple shed, where the chickens are picked and packed in\r\nbarrels, to the more modern poultry-packing establishment, with its\r\naccommodations for fattening, dressing, packing, freezing, and\r\nstoring.\r\n\r\nThe poultry-buying stations may be branches of the larger packing\r\nestablishments, branch houses of large produce firms, or small firms\r\noperating independently and selling in the open market.\r\n\r\nThe chickens as purchased are grouped into the following classes:\r\nSprings, hens, old roosters and (at certain seasons) young roosters\r\nor staggy cockerels. Early in the season small springs are quoted as\r\nbroilers, while capons form a separate item where such are grown.\r\n\r\nChickens are starved before killing, for the purpose of emptying the\r\ncrop, and, to some degree, the intestines. If this is not done the\r\ncarcass presents an unsightly appearance and spoils more readily in\r\nstorage.\r\n\r\nThe method of picking is not always the same, even in the same\r\nplant. Scalding is frequently used for local trade, in the summer\r\nseason, or with cheap-grade stuff. The greater portion of the stock\r\nis picked dry. The pickers are generally paid so much per bird. In\r\nsome plants men do the roughing while girls are employed as pinners.\r\nPickers work either with the chickens suspended by a cord or\r\nfastened upon a bench adopted to this purpose. The killing is done\r\nby bleeding and sticking. The last thrust reaches the brain and\r\nparalyzes the bird. The manner of making these cuts must be learned\r\nby practical instruction. The feathers are saved, and amount to a\r\nconsiderable item. White feathers are worth more than others. The\r\nhead and feet are left on the chicken and the entrails are not\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nThe bird, after being chilled in ice-water or in the cooling room,\r\nis ready for grading and packing. This, from the producer's\r\nstandpoint, is the most interesting stage in the process, for it is\r\nhere that the quality of the stock is to be observed. The grading is\r\nmade on three considerations: (1) The general division of cocks,\r\nsprings, hens and capons is kept separate from the killing-room; (2)\r\nthe grading for quality; (3) the assortment according to size.\r\n\r\nThe grading for quality depends on the general shape of the chicken,\r\nthe plumpness or covering of meat, the neatness of picking, the\r\ncolor of skin and legs, and the appearance of the feet and head,\r\nwhich latter points indicate the age and condition of health. The\r\nculls consist of deformed and scrawny chickens. The seconds are poor\r\nin flesh, or they may be, in the case of hens, unsightly from\r\noverfatness. They are packed in barrels and go to the cheapest\r\ntrade. Those carcasses slightly bruised or torn in dressing also go\r\nin this class. Although a preference is generally stated for\r\nyellow-skinned poultry, the white-skinned birds, if equal in other\r\npoints, are not underranked in this score. The skin color that is\r\ndecidedly objectionable is the purplish tinge, which is a sign of\r\ndiseased stock. Black pin-feathers and dark-colored legs are a\r\nsource of objection. Especially is this true with young birds which\r\nshow the pin-feathers. Feathered legs are slightly more\r\nobjectionable than smooth legs. Small combs and the absence of spurs\r\ngive better appearance to the carcass.\r\n\r\nThe following is the nomenclature and corresponding weights of the\r\nfarm marketed chickens. In each class there will be seconds and\r\nculls. The seconds of each group are kept separate, but not graded\r\nso strictly or perhaps not graded at all for size. The culls are\r\npacked in barrels and all kinds of chickens from fryers to old\r\nroosters here sojourn together until they reach their final\r\ndestination, as potted chicken or chicken soup.\r\n\r\nBroilers--Packed in two weights. 1st: Less than two pounds; 2d:\r\nbetween 2 and 2-1/2 pounds.\r\n\r\nChickens--Packed in three weights. 1st: between 2-1/2 and 3 pounds;\r\n2d: between 3 and 3-1/2 pounds; 3d: between 3-1/2 and 4 pounds.\r\n\r\nRoasters--Packed in two weights. 1st: between 4 and 5 pounds; 2d:\r\nabove 5 pounds.\r\n\r\nStag Roosters--Cockerels, showing spurs and hard blue meat, packed\r\nin two weights. 1st: under 4 pounds; 2d: above 4 pounds.\r\n\r\nFowls, are hens. They are packed in three sizes. 1st: under 3-1/4\r\npounds; 2d: between 3-1/4 and 4-1/2 pounds; 3d: over 4-1/2 pounds.\r\n\r\nOld Roosters--Packed in barrels. One grade only.\r\n\r\nAfter packing, chickens may be shipped to market immediately, or\r\nthey may be frozen and stored in the local plant. Shipments of any\r\nimportance are made in refrigerator cars.\r\n\r\nThe poultry that is shipped to the final market alive is gradually\r\ndiminishing in quantity, as poultry killing plants are built up\r\nthroughout the country. The live poultry shipments are chiefly made\r\nin the Live Poultry Transportation Cars. The following figures give\r\nthe number of such cars that moved out of the States named in a\r\nrecent year:\r\n\r\n    Iowa            645     Tennessee        169\r\n    Missouri        630     Michigan         165\r\n    Illinois        624     S. Dakota        103\r\n    Kentucky        472     Oklahoma         101\r\n    Nebraska        395     Indiana          100\r\n    Kansas          370     Wisconsin         93\r\n    Minnesota       174     Texas             91\r\n    Ohio            173     Arkansas          47\r\n\r\nThe most of this live poultry goes to New York and other eastern\r\ncities and is consumed largely by the Hebrew trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Special Poultry Plant.\r\n\r\nThe special egg farmer of the East should sell his poultry alive to\r\nthe regular dealer. The exception to this advice may be taken in the\r\ncase of squab broilers for which some local dealers will not pay as\r\nfancy a price as may be obtained by dressing and shipping to the\r\nhotel trade.\r\n\r\nThe grower of roasters and capons will probably want to market his\r\nown product. As to whether it will pay him to do so will depend upon\r\nwhether his dealer will pay what the quality of the goods really\r\ndemands. The dealer can afford to do this all right, if he will\r\nhustle around and find an outlet for the particular grade of goods,\r\nfor he is in position to kill and dress the fowls more economically\r\nthan the producer.\r\n\r\nI have never been able to study out why the average writer upon\r\nagricultural subjects is always advising the farmer to attempt to do\r\ndifficult work for which special firms already exist. In the case of\r\nfattening just referred to, there is reason why the farmer may be\r\nable to do the work more successfully than the special\r\nestablishment, but why any one should urge the farmer to turn the\r\nwoodshed into a temporary poultry packing establishment I can hardly\r\nsee. If the farmer has nothing to do he had better get a job at the\r\npoultry killing house where they have ice water and barrels in which\r\nto put the feathers.\r\n\r\nI do not think it worth while in this book for me to attempt to\r\ndescribe in detail the various methods of killing and packing\r\npoultry for the various retail markets. The grower who contemplates\r\nkilling his own stuff had better spend a day visiting the produce\r\nhouses and market stalls and inquire which methods are locally in\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggestions from Other Countries.\r\n\r\nIn European countries generally, and especially in France and\r\nEngland, great pains is taken in the production of market poultry.\r\nEach farmer and each neighborhood become known in the market for the\r\nquality of their poultry, and the prices they receive vary\r\naccordingly. In these countries more poultry is fattened and dressed\r\nby the growers than in the United States where we have greater\r\nspecialization of labor.\r\n\r\nIn countries that have an export trade different systems have\r\noriginated. In Denmark and Ireland co-operative societies are\r\norganized to handle perishable farm products. These, however, deal\r\nmore with eggs than with poultry. In portions of England the\r\nfattening is done by private fatteners. The country being thickly\r\nsettled, the chickens are collected directly from the farms by\r\nwagons making regular trips. This allows the rejection of the poor\r\nand immature specimens, whereas a premium may be paid on better\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nThe greatest fault of poultry buying as conducted in this country is\r\nthe evil of a uniform price. After chickens are dressed the\r\ndifference of quality is readily discerned, and the price varies\r\nfrom fancy quotations to almost nothing for culls. The packer pays a\r\ngiven rate per pound for live hens or for spring chickens. The price\r\nis paid alike for the best poultry received or for the scrawniest\r\nchickens that can be coaxed to stand up and be weighed. The prices\r\npaid is the average worth of all chickens purchased at that market.\r\nAll farmers who market an article better than the average are unjust\r\nlosers, while those who sell inferior stock receive unearned\r\nprofits. The producer of good stock receives pay for the extra\r\nquantity of his chickens, but for the extra quality no recognition\r\nwhatever is given. To the deserving producer, if quality was\r\nrecognized, it would result in a greatly increased stimulation of\r\nthe production of good poultry. Any packer, if questioned, will\r\nstate that he would be willing to grade chickens and pay for them\r\naccording to quality, but that he does not do so because his\r\ncompetitor would pay a uniform price and drive him out of business.\r\nThe man who receives an increased price would say little of it,\r\nwhile the man who sells poor chickens, if he failed to receive the\r\nfull amount to which he is accustomed, would think himself unjustly\r\ntreated and use his influence against the dealer. A recognition of\r\nquality in buying is for the interest of both the farmer and the\r\npoultry dealer, and a mutual effort on the part of those interested\r\nto put in practice this reform would result in a great improvement\r\nof the poultry industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nCold Storage of Poultry.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the cold storage of poultry has been phenomenal.\r\nPoultry is packed in thin boxes that will readily lose their heat\r\nand these are stacked in a freezer with a temperature near the zero\r\npoint. The temperature used for holding poultry are anywhere from 0\r\ndegree up to 20 degrees. Poultry is held for periods of one to six\r\nweeks at temperature above the freezing point.\r\n\r\nFrozen poultry will keep almost indefinitely save for the drying\r\nout, which is due to the fact that evaporation will proceed slowly\r\neven from a frozen body. The time frozen poultry is stored varies\r\nfrom a few weeks to eight or ten months.\r\n\r\nThe usual rule is that any crop is highest in price when it first\r\ncomes on the market and cheapest just after the point of its\r\ngreatest production. Thus, broilers are high in May and cheap in\r\nSeptember. In such cases the goods are carried from the season of\r\nplenty to the following season of scarcity. This period is always\r\nless than a year. The idea circulated by wild writers, that cold\r\nstorage poultry was kept several years is an economic impossibility.\r\nThe interest on the investment alone would make the holding of\r\nstorage goods into the second season of plenty, quite unprofitable,\r\nbut when the costs of storage, insurance and shrinkage are to be\r\npaid, storing poultry for more than one season becomes absurd. The\r\nfowl that has been once frozen cannot be made to look \"fresh killed\"\r\nagain. For that reason packers like to get a monopoly on a\r\nparticular market so that the two classes of goods will not have to\r\ncompete side by side. The quality of the frozen fowl when served is\r\nvery fair, practically as good as and some say better than the fresh\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nCold storage poultry is best thawed out by being placed over night\r\nin a tank of water. Poultry prejudice prevents the practice of\r\nretailing the goods frozen, though this method would be highly\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrawn or Undrawn Fowls.\r\n\r\nWithin the last two or three years there has been a great hue and\r\ncry about the marketing of poultry without drawing the entrails.\r\n\r\nThe objection to the custom rests upon the general prejudice to\r\nallowing the entrails of animals to remain in the carcass. If a\r\nlittle thought is given the subject, however, it is seen that human\r\nprejudice is very inconsistent in such matters. We draw beef and\r\nmutton carcasses, to be sure, but fish and game are stored undrawn,\r\nand as for oysters and lobsters we not only store them undrawn but\r\nwe eat them so.\r\n\r\nThe facts about the undrawn poultry proposition are as follows: The\r\nintestines of the fowl at death contain numerous species of\r\nbacteria, whereas the flesh is quite free from germs. If the carcass\r\nis not drawn, but immediately frozen hard, the bacteria remain\r\ninactive and no essential change occurs. If the carcass is stored\r\nwithout freezing, or remains for even a short time at a high\r\ntemperature, the bacteria will begin to grow through the intestinal\r\nwalls and contaminate the flesh.\r\n\r\nNow, if the fowl is drawn, the unprotected flesh is exposed to\r\nbacterial contamination, which results in decomposition more rapidly\r\nthan through the intestinal walls. The opening of the carcass also\r\nallows a greater drying out and shrinkage.\r\n\r\nIf poultry carcasses were split wide open as with beef or mutton,\r\ndrawing might not prove as satisfactory as the present method, but\r\nsince this is not desirable, and since ordinary laborers will break\r\nthe intestines and spill their contents over the flesh, and\r\notherwise mutilate the fowl, all those who have had actual\r\nexperience in the matter agree that drawing poultry is unpractical\r\nand undesirable.\r\n\r\nAs far as danger of disease or ptomaine poison is concerned, chances\r\nbetween the two methods seem to offer little choice.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Chemistry of the U.S. Department of Agriculture has\r\nconducted a series of experiments along the line of poultry storage.\r\nSo far as the results have been published, nothing very striking has\r\nbeen learned. From what has been published, the writer is of the\r\nopinion that the somewhat mysterious changes that were observed in\r\nthe cold storage poultry were mostly a matter of drying out of the\r\ncarcass.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoultry Inspection.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiastic members of the medical profession, and others whose\r\nknowledge of practical affairs is somewhat limited, occasionally\r\ncome forth with the idea of an inspection of poultry carcasses\r\nsimilar to the Federal inspection of the heavier meats.\r\n\r\nThe reasons that are supposed to warrant the Federal meat inspection\r\nare precaution against disease and the idea of enforcing a\r\ncleanliness in the handling of food behind the consumer's back,\r\nwhich he would insist upon were he the preparer of his own food\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nNo doubt there is well established evidence that some diseases, such\r\nas the dread trichinosis, are acquired by the consumption of\r\ndiseased meat. As far as it is at present known there are no\r\ndiseases acquired from the consumption of diseased poultry flesh,\r\nbut, as we do not know as much about the bacteria that infests\r\npoultry as we do of that of larger animals, there is no positive\r\nproof that such transmission of disease could not occur. Thorough\r\ncooking kills all disease germs, and poultry is seldom, if ever,\r\neaten without such preparation.\r\n\r\nThe idea of protecting people from uncleanly methods of handling\r\ntheir foods, concerning which they cannot themselves know, is\r\nsomewhat of a sentimental proposition. In practice it amounts to\r\nnothing, save as the popular conception of this protection increases\r\nthe demand for the product which is marked \"U.S. Inspected and\r\nPassed.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to some of the reformers of 1906 to know that\r\nthe meat inspection bill then forced upon Congress by a clamoring\r\npublic was desired by the packers themselves. Because Congress would\r\nnot listen to the packers, and the Department of Agriculture, the\r\nChief Executive very kindly indulged in a little conversation with a\r\nfew reporters, the results of which gave Congress the needed\r\ninspiration.\r\n\r\nIt cost the Government three million dollars to tell the people that\r\ntheir meats are packed in a cleanly manner. If the people want this,\r\nit is all well and good. The tax it places upon the price of meat is\r\nless than half of one per cent.\r\n\r\nA similar inspection of the killing and packing of poultry would\r\ninvolve a very much higher rate of taxation, because of the fact\r\nthat poultry products are packed in small establishments scattered\r\nthroughout the entire country.\r\n\r\nOne reason that the meat packers wanted the United States\r\nInspection, is because it puts out of business the little fellow to\r\nwhom the Government cannot afford to grant inspection. A few of the\r\nvery largest poultry packers would like to see poultry inspection\r\nfor the same reason, but with the business so thoroughly scattered\r\nas to render Government inspection so expensive as to be quite\r\nimpracticable, any such bill would certainly be killed in a\r\ncongressional committee.\r\n\r\nAny practical means to bring about the cleanly handling, and to\r\nprevent the consumption of diseased poultry, should certainly be\r\nencouraged. This can be done by the education of the consumer.\r\nPoultry carcasses should be marketed with head and feet attached and\r\nthe entrails undrawn. By this precaution the consumer may tell\r\nwhether the fowl he is buying is male or female, young or old,\r\nhealthy or diseased. All cold storage poultry should be frozen and\r\nshould be sold to the consumer in a frozen condition.\r\n\r\nI am not in favor of the detailed regulation of business by law, but\r\nI do believe that the legal enforcement of these last precautions\r\nwould be a good thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nQUALITY IN EGGS [*]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *: Much of the matter in this and the following chapter is\r\ntaken from the writer's report of the egg trade of the United\r\nStates, published as Circular 140 of the Bureau of Annual Industry\r\nof the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In the present volume,\r\nhowever, I have inserted some additional matters which policy\r\nforbade that I discuss in a Federal document.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of the readiness with which eggs spoil, the term \"fresh\" has\r\nbecome synonymous with the idea of desirable quality in eggs. As a\r\nmatter of fact the actual age of an egg is quite subordinate to\r\nother factors which affect the quality.\r\n\r\nAn egg forty-eight hours old that has lain in a wheat shock during a\r\nwarm July rain, would probably be swarming with bacteria and be\r\nabsolutely unfit for food. Another egg stored eight months in a\r\nfirst-class cold storage room would be perfectly wholesome.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrading Eggs.\r\n\r\nEggs are among the most difficult of food products to grade, because\r\neach egg must be considered separately and because the actual\r\nsubstance of the egg cannot be examined without destroying the egg.\r\nFrom external appearance, eggs can be selected for size, color,\r\ncleanliness of shell and freedom from cracks. This is the common\r\nmethod of grading in early spring when the eggs are uniformly of\r\ngood quality.\r\n\r\nLater in the season the egg candle is used. In the technical sense\r\nany kind of a light may be used as an egg candle. A sixteen candle\r\npower electric lamp is the most desirable. The light is enclosed in\r\na dark box, and the eggs are held against openings about the size of\r\na half dollar. The candler holds the egg large end upward, and gives\r\nit a quick turn in order to view all sides, and to cause the\r\ncontents to whirl within the shell. To the expert this process\r\nreveals the actual condition of the egg to an extent that the novice\r\ncan hardly realize. The art of egg candling cannot be readily taught\r\nby worded description. One who wishes to learn egg candling had best\r\ngo to an adept in the art, or he may begin unaided and by breaking\r\nmany eggs learn the essential points.\r\n\r\nEggs when laid vary considerably in size, but otherwise are a very\r\nuniform product. The purpose of the egg in nature requires that this\r\nbe the case, because the contents of the egg must be so proportioned\r\nas to form the chick without surplus or waste, and this demands a\r\nvery constant chemical composition.\r\n\r\nFor food purposes all fresh eggs are practically equal. The tint of\r\nthe yolk varies a little, being a brighter yellow when green food\r\nhas been supplied the hens. Occasionally, when hens eat unusual\r\nquantities of green food, the yolk show a greenish brown tint, and\r\nappear dark to the candler. Such eggs are called grass eggs; they\r\nare perfectly wholesome.\r\n\r\nAn opinion exists among egg men that the white of the spring egg is\r\nof finer quality and will stand up better than summer eggs. This is\r\ntrue enough of commercial eggs, but the difference is chiefly, if\r\nnot entirely, due to external factors that act upon the egg after it\r\nis laid.\r\n\r\nThere are some other peculiarities that may exist in eggs at the\r\ntime of laying, such as a blood clot enclosed with the contents of\r\nthe egg, a broken yolk or perhaps bacterial contamination. \"Tape\r\nworms,\" so-called by egg candlers, are detached portions of the\r\nmembrane lining of the egg. \"Liver spots\" or \"meat spots\" are\r\ndetached folds from the walls of the oviduct. Such abnormalities are\r\nrare and not worth worrying about.\r\n\r\nThe shells of eggs vary in shape, color and firmness. These\r\nvariations are more a matter of breed and individual idiosyncrasy\r\nthan of care or feed.\r\n\r\nThe strength of egg shells is important because of the loss from\r\nbreakage. The distinction between weak and firm shelled eggs is not\r\none, however, which can be readily remedied. Nothing more can be\r\nadvised in this regard than to feed a ration containing plenty of\r\nmineral matter and to discard hens that lay noticeably weak shelled\r\nor irregularly shaped eggs.\r\n\r\nPreference in the color of eggs shells is a hobby, and one well\r\nworth catering to. As is commonly stated, Boston and surrounding\r\ntowns want brown eggs, while New York and San Francisco demand white\r\neggs. These trade fancies take their origin in the circumstances of\r\nthere being large henneries in the respective localities producing\r\nthe particular class of eggs. If the eggs from such farms are the\r\nbest in the market and were uniformly of a particular shade, that\r\nmark of distinction, like the trade name on a popular article, would\r\nnaturally become a selling point. Only the select trade consider the\r\ncolor in buying.\r\n\r\nEggs of all Mediterranean breeds are white. Those of Asiatics are\r\nbrown. Those of the American breeds are usually brown, but not of so\r\nuniform a tint.\r\n\r\nThe size of eggs is chiefly controlled by the breed or by selection\r\nof layers of large eggs. In a number of experiments published by\r\nvarious experiment stations, slight differences in the sizes of the\r\neggs have been noted with varying rations and environment, but this\r\ncannot be attributed to anything more specific than the general\r\ndevelopment and vigor of the fowls. Pullets, at the beginning of the\r\nlaying period, lay an egg decidedly smaller than those produced at a\r\nlater stage in life.\r\n\r\nThe egg size table below gives the size of representative\r\nclasses of eggs. These figures must not be applied too rigidly, as\r\nthe eggs of all breeds and all localities vary. They are given as\r\napproximate averages of the eggs one might reasonably expect to find\r\nin the class mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                EGG SIZE TABLE.\r\n\r\n  GEOGRAPHICAL          BREED                     Net Wt.

The percentage of dirty eggs varies with the season and\r\nweather conditions, being noticeably increased during rainy weather.\r\nIn grading, about five per cent. of farm grown eggs are thrown out\r\nas dirties. These dirties are sold at a loss of at least twenty per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nThe common trade name for cracked eggs is checks. Blind checks are\r\nthose in which the break in the shell is not readily observable.\r\nThey are detected with the aid of the candle, or by sounding, which\r\nconsists of clicking the eggs together. Dents are checks in which\r\nthe egg shell is pushed in without rupturing the membrane. Leakers\r\nhave lost part of the contents and are not only an entire loss\r\nthemselves, but produce smeared eggs.\r\n\r\nThe loss from breakage varies considerably with the amount of\r\nhandling in the process of marketing. A western produce house,\r\ncollecting from grocers by local freight will record from four to\r\nseven per cent. of checks. With properly handled eggs the loss\r\nthrough breakage should not run over one or two per cent.\r\n\r\nEggs in which the chick has begun to develop are spoken of as\r\n\"heated\" eggs. Infertile eggs cannot heat because the germ has not\r\nbeen fertilized and can make no growth. That such infertile eggs\r\ncannot spoil is, however, a mistaken notion, for they are subjected\r\nto all the other factors by which\r\n\r\neggs may be spoiled. The sale of eggs tested out of the incubators\r\nhas been encouraged by the dissemination of the knowledge that\r\ninfertile eggs are not changed by incubation. Eggs thrown out of an\r\nincubator will be shrunken and weakened, and some of them may\r\ncontain dead germs and the remains of chicks that have died after\r\nstarting to develop. Such eggs may be sold for what they are, but\r\nshould never be mixed with other eggs or sold as fresh. When\r\ncarefully candled they should be worth ten or twelve cents a dozen.\r\n\r\nFertile eggs, at the time of laying, cannot be told from infertile\r\neggs, as the germ of the chick is microscopic in size. If the egg is\r\nimmediately cooled and held at a temperature below 70 degrees, the\r\ngerm will not develop. At a temperature of 103 degrees, the\r\ndevelopment of the chick proceeds most rapidly. At this temperature\r\nthe development is about as follows:\r\n\r\nTwelve hours incubation: When broken in a saucer, the germ spot,\r\nvisible upon all eggs, seems somewhat enlarged. Looked at with a\r\ncandle such an egg cannot be distinguished from a fresh egg.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four hours: The germ spot mottled and about the size of a\r\ndime. This egg, if not too dark shelled, can readily be detected\r\nwith the candle, the germ spot causing the yolk to appear\r\nconsiderably darker than the yolk of a fresh egg. Such an egg is\r\ncalled a heavy egg or a floater.\r\n\r\nForty-eight hours: By this time the opaque white membrane, which\r\nsurrounds the germ, has spread well over the top of the yolk, and\r\nthe egg is quite dark or heavy before the light. Blood appears at\r\nabout this period, but is difficult of detection by the candler,\r\nunless the germ dies and the blood ring sticks to the membrane of\r\nthe egg.\r\n\r\nThree days: The blood ring is the prominent feature and is as large\r\nas a nickel. The yolk behind the membrane has become watery.\r\n\r\nFour days: The body of the chick becomes readily visible, and\r\nprominent radiating blood vessels are seen. The yolk is half covered\r\nwith a water containing membrane.\r\n\r\nThese stages develop as given, occurring at a temperature of 103\r\ndegrees. As the temperature is lowered the rate of chick development\r\nis retarded, but at any temperature above 70, this development will\r\nproceed far enough to cause serious injury to the quality of the\r\neggs.\r\n\r\nFor commercial use eggs may be grouped in regard to heating as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n(1) No heat shown. Cannot be told at the candle from fresh eggs.\r\n\r\n(2) Light floats. First grade that can be separated by candling,\r\ncorresponding to about twenty-four hours of incubation. These are\r\nnot objectionable to the average housewife.\r\n\r\n(3) Heavy floats. This group has no distinction from the former,\r\nexcept an exaggeration of the same feature. These eggs are\r\nobjectionable to the fastidious housewife, because of the appearing\r\nof the white and scummy looking allantois on the yolk.\r\n\r\n(4) Blood rings. Eggs in which blood has developed, extending to the\r\nperiod when the chick becomes visible. (5) Chicks visible to the\r\ncandle.\r\n\r\nThe loss due to heated eggs is enormous; probably greater than that\r\ncaused by any other source of loss to the egg trade. The loss varies\r\nwith the season of the year, and the climate. In New England heat\r\nloss is to be considered as in the same class as loss from dirties\r\nand checks. In Texas the egg business from the 15th of June until\r\ncool weather in the fall is practically dead. People stop eating\r\neggs at home and shipping out of the State nets the producer such\r\nsmall returns by the time the loss is allowed that, at the prices\r\noffered, it hardly pays the farmer to gather the eggs. In the season\r\nof 1901 hatched chickens were commonly found in cases of market\r\neggs, throughout the trans-Mississippi region, and eggs did well to\r\nnet the shippers three cents per dozen.\r\n\r\nDamage to eggs by heating and consequent financial loss is\r\ninexcusable. In the first place, market eggs have no business being\r\nfertilized, but whether they are or not they should be kept in a\r\nplace sufficiently cool to prevent all germ growth.\r\n\r\nThe egg shell is porous so that the developing chick may obtain air.\r\nThis exposes the moist contents of the egg to the drying influence\r\nof the atmosphere. Evaporation from eggs takes place constantly. It\r\nis increased by warm temperatures, dry air and currents of air\r\nstriking the egg.\r\n\r\nWhen the egg is formed within the hen the contents fill the shell\r\ncompletely. As the egg cools the contents shrink, and the two layers\r\nof membrane separate in the large end of the egg, causing the\r\nappearance of the bubble or air cell. Evaporation of water from the\r\negg further shrinks the contents and increases the size of the air\r\ncell. The size of the air cell is commonly taken as a guide to the\r\nage of the egg. But when we consider that with the same relative\r\nhumidity on a hot July day, evaporation would take place about ten\r\ntimes as fast as on a frosty November morning, and that differences\r\nin humidity and air currents equally great occur between localities,\r\nwe see that the age of an egg, judged by this method, means simply\r\nthe extent of evaporation, and proves nothing at all about the\r\nactual age.\r\n\r\nEven as a measure of evaporation, the size of the air cell may be\r\ndeceptive, for when an egg with an air cell of considerable size is\r\nroughly handled, the air cell breaks down the side of the egg, and\r\ngives the air cell the appearance of being larger than it really is.\r\nStill rougher handling of shrunken eggs may cause the rupture of the\r\ninner membrane, allowing the air to escape into the contents of the\r\negg. This causes a so-called watery or frothy egg. The quality is in\r\nno wise injured by the mechanical mishap, but eggs so ruptured are\r\nusually discriminated against by candlers.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it might be well to speak further of the subject\r\nof \"white strength,\" by which is meant the stiffness or viscosity of\r\nthe egg white. The white of an egg is a limpid, clear liquid, but in\r\nthe egg of good quality that portion immediately surrounding the\r\nyolk appears to be in a semi-solid mass. The cause of this\r\nappearance is the presence of an invisible network of fibrous\r\nmaterial. By age and mechanical disturbance this network is\r\ngradually broken down and the liquid white separates out. Such a\r\nweak and watery white is usually associated with shrunken eggs.\r\nThese eggs will not stand up well or whip into a firm froth and are\r\nthrown in lower grades.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the yolk membranes also increases with age, and is\r\nobjectionable because the breakage of the yolk is unsightly and\r\nspoils the egg for poaching.\r\n\r\nThe shrunken egg is most abundant in the fall, when the rising\r\nprices tempt the farmer and grocery man to hold the eggs. This\r\nholding is so prevalent, in fact, that from August to December full\r\nfresh eggs are the exception rather than the rule.\r\n\r\nWhile we have called attention to evaporation as the most pronounced\r\nfault of fall eggs, losses from other causes are greatly increased\r\nby the holding process.\r\n\r\nIf the eggs are held in a warm place, heat and shrinkage will case\r\nthe greatest damage; if held in a cellar, rot, mold, and bad odors\r\nwill cause the chief loss.\r\n\r\nThe loss due to shrunken eggs is not understood nor appreciated by\r\nthose outside the trade. Such ignorance is due to the fact that the\r\nshrunken is not so repulsive as the rotten or heated egg. But the\r\ninferiority of the shrunken egg is so well appreciated by the\r\nconsumer that high class dealers find it impossible to use them\r\nwithout ruining their trade. The result is that shrunken eggs are\r\nconstantly being sent into the cheaper channels, with the result\r\nthat all lower grades of eggs are more depreciated in the fall of\r\nthe year than at any other time.\r\n\r\nIn the classes of spoiled eggs, of which we have thus far spoken,\r\nthe proverbial rotten egg has not been considered. The term \"rot\" in\r\nthe egg trade is used to apply to any egg absolutely unfit for food\r\npurposes. But I prefer to confine the term \"rotten egg\" to the egg\r\nwhich contains a growth of bacteria.\r\n\r\nThe normal egg when laid is germ free. But the egg shell is not germ\r\nproof. The pores in the egg shell proper are large enough to admit\r\nall forms of bacteria, but the membrane inside the shell is germ\r\nproof as long as it remains dry. When this membrane becomes moist so\r\nthat bacteria may grow in it, these germs of decay quickly grow\r\nthrough it and contaminate the contents of the egg.\r\n\r\nHeat favors the growth of bacteria in eggs and sufficient cold\r\nprevents it, but as bacteria cannot enter without moisture on the\r\nsurface of the egg we can consider dampness as the cause of rotten\r\neggs. Moisture on the shell may come from an external wetting, from\r\nthe \"sweating\" of eggs coming out of cold storage, or by the\r\nprevention of evaporation to such an extent that the external\r\nmoisture of the egg thoroughly soaks the membrane. The latter\r\nhappens in damp cellars, and when eggs are covered with some\r\nimpervious material.\r\n\r\nRotten eggs may be of different kinds, according to the species of\r\ngerm that causes the decomposition. The specific kinds of egg\r\nrotting bacteria have not been worked out, but the following three\r\ngroups of bacterially infected eggs are readily distinguishable in\r\nthe practical work of egg candling.\r\n\r\n(1) Black rots. It is probable that many different species of\r\nbacteria cause this form of rotten eggs. The prominent feature is\r\nthe formation of hydrogen sulphide gas, which blackens the contents\r\nof the egg, gives the characteristic rotten egg smell and sometimes\r\ncauses the equally well known explosion.\r\n\r\n(2) Sour eggs or white rots. These eggs have a characteristic sour\r\nsmell. The contents become watery, the yolk and the whites mix and\r\nthe whole egg is offensive to both eye and nose.\r\n\r\n(3) The spot rot. In this the bacterial growth has not contaminated\r\nthe whole egg, but has remained near the point of entrance. Such\r\neggs are readily picked out with the candle, and when broken open\r\nshow lumpy adhesions on the inside of the shell. These lumps are of\r\nvarious colors and appearances. It is probable that these spots are\r\ncaused as much by mold as by bacteria, but for practical purposes\r\nthe distinction is immaterial.\r\n\r\nIn practice it is impossible to separate rotten from heated eggs for\r\nthe reason that in the typical nest of spoiled eggs found around the\r\nfarm, both causes have been at work. Dead chicks will not\r\nnecessarily cause the eggs to decay, but many such eggs do become\r\ncontaminated by bacteria before they reach the candler, and hence,\r\nas a physician would say, show complications.\r\n\r\nThe loss of eggs that are actually rotten is not as great as one\r\nmight imagine. Perhaps one or two per cent. of the country's egg\r\ncrop actually rot, but the expenses of the candling necessitated,\r\nand the lowering of value of eggs that contain even a few rotten\r\nspecimens are severe losses.\r\n\r\nMoldy or musty eggs are caused by accidentally wet cases or damp\r\ncellars and ice houses. The moldy egg is most frequently a spot rot.\r\nIn the musty egg proper the meat is free from foreign organisms, but\r\nhas been tainted by the odor of mold growth upon the shell or\r\npacking materials.\r\n\r\nThe absorption of odors is the most baffling of all causes of bad\r\neggs. Here the candler, so expert in other points, is usually\r\nhelpless. Eggs, by storage in old musty cellars, or in rooms, with\r\nlemons, onions and cheese, may become so badly flavored as to be\r\nseriously objected to by a fancy trade, and yet there is no means of\r\ndetecting the trouble without destroying the egg. Such eggs occur\r\nmost frequently among the held stock of the fall season.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Loss Due to Carelessness.\r\n\r\nThe egg crop of the country, more than ninety-five per cent, of\r\nwhich originates on the general farm, is subject to immense waste\r\ndue to ignorant and careless handling. The great mass of eggs for\r\nsale in our large cities possess to a greater or less degree the\r\nfaults we have discussed.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the loss due to the present shiftless method of\r\nhandling eggs, may be obtained by a comparison of the actual average\r\nprices received for all eggs sold in New York City, and the\r\nwholesale prices quoted by a prominent New York firm dealing in high\r\ngrade goods. The contrasted price for the year 1907 are as follows:\r\n\r\n    Prices at which total goods      Wholesale prices for strictly\r\n              moved.                         fresh eggs.\r\n\r\n    January                25.8     January                     42.\r\n    February               24.5     February                    40.\r\n    March                  19.3     March                       32.\r\n    April                  16.9     April                       30.\r\n    May                    16.6     May                         31.\r\n    June                   15.5     June                        32.\r\n    July                   15.6     July                        35.\r\n    August                 17.7     August                      38.\r\n    September              20.7     September                   40.\r\n    October                21.4     October                     42.\r\n    November               26.0     November                    45.\r\n    December               27.7     December                    48.\r\n\r\nThe total values figured by multiplying these prices by the\r\nNew York receipts, are as follows:\r\n\r\n    Amount actually received                  $23,832,000\r\n    Values at quotations for strictly fresh    44,730,000\r\n\r\nNo one would contend it is possible to bring the entire egg crop of\r\nthe country up to the latter value, but the fact that there is a\r\ndefinite market for eggs of first class quality at almost double the\r\nfigures for which the egg crop as a whole is actually sold, is a\r\npoint very significant to the ambitious producer of high grade eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\nRequisites of the Production of High Grade Eggs.\r\n\r\n(a) Hens that produce a goodly number of eggs, and at the same time\r\nan egg that is moderately large (average two ounces each). Plymouth\r\nRocks, Wyandottes, Rhode Island Reds, Orpingtons, Leghorns, Minorcas\r\nare the varieties which will do this.\r\n\r\n(b) Good housing, regular feeding and watering, and above all clean,\r\ndry nests.\r\n\r\n(c) Daily gathering of eggs, when the temperature is above 80\r\ndegrees, gathering twice a day.\r\n\r\n(d) The confining of all broody hens as soon as discovered.\r\n\r\n(e) The rejection as doubtful of all eggs found in a nest which was\r\nnot visited the previous day. (Such eggs should be used at home\r\nwhere each may be broken separately).\r\n\r\n(f) The placing as soon as gathered of all summer eggs in the\r\ncoolest spot available.\r\n\r\n(g) The prevention at all times of moisture in any form coming in\r\ncontact with the egg's shell.\r\n\r\n(h) The selling of young cockerels before they begin to annoy the\r\nhens. Also the selling or confining of old male birds from the time\r\nhatching is over until cool weather in fall.\r\n\r\n(i) The using of cracked and dirty, as well as small eggs, at home.\r\nSuch eggs if consumed when fresh are perfectly wholesome, but when\r\nmarketed are discriminated against and are likely to become an\r\nentire loss.\r\n\r\n(j) Keeping eggs away from musty cellars or bad odors.\r\n\r\n(k) Keeping the egg as cool and dry as possible while en route to\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n(l) The marketing of all eggs at least once per week and oftener,\r\nwhen facilities permit.\r\n\r\n(m) The use of strong, clean cases or cartons and good fillers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nHOW EGGS ARE MARKETED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe methods by which the larger number of American eggs pass from\r\nthe producer to consumer is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe eggs are gathered by the farmer with varying regularity and are\r\nbrought perhaps on the average of once a week, to the local village\r\nmerchant.\r\n\r\nThis merchant receives weekly quotations from a number of\r\nsurrounding egg dealers and at intervals of from two days to two\r\nweeks, ships to such a dealer, by local freight. The dealer buys the\r\neggs case count, that is, he pays for them by the case regardless of\r\nquality. He then repacks the eggs in new cases and, with the\r\nexception of a period in the early spring, candles them.\r\n\r\nThis dealer, in turn, receives quotations from city egg houses and\r\nsells to them by wire. He usually ships in carload lots. The city\r\nreceiver may also be a jobber who sells to grocers, or he may sell\r\nthe car outright to a jobbing house. The jobber re-candles the eggs,\r\nsorting them into a number of grades, which are sold to various\r\nclasses of trade. The last link in the chain is the housewife, who\r\nby 'phone or personal call, asks for \"a dozen nice fresh eggs.\"\r\n\r\nThis most frequently repeated story of the American egg applies\r\nparticularly in the case of eggs produced west of the Mississippi\r\nand marketed in the very large cities of the East.\r\n\r\nWe will now discuss the various steps of the egg trade, pointing out\r\nthe reason for the existence of the present methods and their\r\ninfluence upon quality and consequent value.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Country Merchant.\r\n\r\nThe country merchant is the logical business link between the farmer\r\nand the outside world and usually continues to act as the farmers'\r\nbuyer and seller until the commodity dealt in becomes of such\r\nimportance as to demand more specialized form of marketing. Eggs\r\nbeing a perishable crop continuously produced, must be marketed at\r\nfrequent intervals, and the trips to the general store, necessary to\r\nsupply the household needs, offers the only convenient opportunity\r\nfor such marketing.\r\n\r\nThe merchant buys eggs because by doing so he can control his\r\nselling trade.\r\n\r\nThe farmer trades where he sells his eggs, because it is convenient\r\nto do both errands at one place, and also because he wishes to avoid\r\naffronting the merchant by breaking the established custom of\r\ntrading out the amount.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons the merchant knows that to buy eggs means to sell\r\ngoods, and he therefore bids for eggs. His competitors across the\r\nstreet, and in other towns, also bid for eggs. The effect to the\r\nmerchant of lowering the price of his goods or raising the price of\r\neggs is financially the same. In either case it is the matter of\r\ncutting the prices under the spur of competition. Now, the articles\r\non which the merchant make his chief profits from the farmers' trade\r\nare dry goods and notions. Such articles are not standardized, but\r\nvary in a manner quite impossible of estimation by the\r\nunsophisticated. On the other hand, eggs are quoted by the dozen,\r\nand all that run may read.\r\n\r\nSuppose, for illustration, two merchants in the same town are each\r\ndoing a business with a twenty per cent. profit, and are buying eggs\r\nat ten cents and selling for eleven, the cent advance being\r\nsufficient to pay for their labor, incidental loss, and a small\r\nprofit. Now one merchant concludes to play for more trade. If he\r\nmarks his goods down he would gain some trade, but many people would\r\nfear his goods were cheap. But if he puts up a placard, \"Eleven\r\nCents Paid For Eggs,\" the farmers will throng his store and never\r\nquestion the quality of his goods. This move having been successful,\r\nhis rival across the street quietly stocks up with a cheaper line of\r\ndry goods, and some fine morning puts out a card, \"Twelve Cents For\r\nEggs.\" The farm wagons this week will be hitched on the other side\r\nof the street.\r\n\r\nThe rate of business at ten per cent, being insufficient to maintain\r\ntwo men in the town, a mutual understanding is gradually brought\r\nabout by which the prices of goods sold are worked back to the basis\r\nof twenty per cent, gross profit, but the false price of eggs will\r\nserve to draw the trade from neighboring towns and is therefore\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact the price paid to farmers for eggs by the\r\ngeneral stores of the Mississippi Valley is frequently one to two\r\ncents above the price at which the storekeeper sells the product.\r\nAllowing the cost of handling, we have a condition prevailing in\r\nwhich the merchant is handling eggs at from five to ten per cent.\r\nloss, and it stands to reason that he is making up the loss by\r\nadding that per cent. to his profits on his goods. Some of the\r\neffects of this system are:\r\n\r\n1--The inflated prices of merchandise is an injustice to the\r\ntownspeople and to farmers not selling produce, in fact it amounts\r\nto a taxation of these people for the benefit of the egg producers.\r\n2--The inflated prices of merchant's wares work to his disadvantage\r\nin competition with mail order or out-of-town trade. 3--The farmer\r\nwho exchanges eggs for dry goods is not being paid more for his\r\neggs, save as the tax on the townspeople contributes a little to\r\nthat end, but is in the main merely swapping more dollars. 4--The\r\nuse of eggs as a drawing card for trade works in favor of inferior\r\nproduce, and the loss to the farmer through the lowering of prices\r\nthus caused, is much greater than his gain through the forced\r\ncontributions of his neighbors.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Huckster.\r\n\r\nThe huckster or peddling wagon which gathers eggs and other produce\r\ndirectly from the farm, prevail east and south of a line drawn from\r\nGalveston to Chicago through Texarkana, Ark., Springfield, Mo., and\r\nSt. Louis. North and west of this line the huckster is almost\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nThe huckster wagons may be of the following types:\r\n\r\n1--An extension of the local grocery store, trading merchandise for\r\neggs. 2--An independent traveling peddler. 3--A cash dealer who buys\r\nhis load, and hauls it to the nearest city where he peddles the\r\nproduce from house to house or sells it to city grocers. 4--A\r\nrepresentative of the local produce buyer. 5--A fifth style of egg\r\nwagon does not visit the farm at all, but is a system of rural\r\nfreight service run by a produce buyer for the purpose of collecting\r\nthe eggs from country stores.\r\n\r\nAs far as the quality of product and advantage to the farmer is\r\nconcerned, the fourth style of huckster is preferable. This style\r\nexists chiefly in Indiana and Michigan, and the better settled\r\nregions of Kentucky and Tennessee. The writer found hucksters in\r\nsouthern Michigan working on a profit of one-half a cent per dozen,\r\nwhile in the mountains of Tennessee he found a huckster paying ten\r\ncents for eggs that were worth eighteen cents in Chattanooga, and\r\ntwenty-three cents in New York.\r\n\r\nThe huckster scheme of gathering eggs would seemingly be a means of\r\nobtaining good eggs because of the advantage of regularity of\r\ncollection, but in reality it does not always work out that way.\r\nWhile it must be admitted that in the isolated regions of the Middle\r\nand Southern States the presence of the huckster is the only factor\r\nthat makes egg selling possible, it is also true that the peddling\r\nhuckster of those regions usually disregards the first principles of\r\nhandling perishable products. He makes a week's trip in sun and rain\r\nwith his load of produce, with the result that the quality of his\r\nsummer eggs is about as low as can be found.\r\n\r\nIn the more densely populated region with a twice or thrice a week,\r\nor even daily service, the huckster egg becomes the finest farm\r\ngrown egg in the market.\r\n\r\nThe second step in the usual scheme of egg marketing is the sale of\r\neggs collected by the small storekeeper to the produce man or\r\nshipper.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Produce Buyer.\r\n\r\nThroughout the Mississippi Valley there are wholesale produce houses\r\nat all important railroad junctions. A typical house will ship the\r\nproduce of one to three counties. These houses, once a week or\r\noftener, send out postal card quotations. These quotations read so\r\nmuch per case, and are usually case count, with a reservation,\r\nhowever, of the privilege to reject or charge loss on goods that are\r\nutterly bad. Each grocery receives quotations from one to a dozen\r\nsuch houses, and perhaps also from commission firms in the nearest\r\ncity. The highest of these quotations gets the shipment.\r\n\r\nThe buyer repacks the eggs and usually candles them, the strictness\r\nof the grading depending upon the intended destination. The loss in\r\ncandling is generally kept account of, but is seldom charged back to\r\nthe shipper. The egg man wants volume of business, and if he\r\nantagonizes a shipper by charging up his loss, the usual result will\r\nbe the loss of trade. So the buyer estimates his probable loss and\r\nlowers his price enough to cover it.\r\n\r\nBy loss off, or \"rots out,\" is meant the subtraction of the bad eggs\r\nfrom the number to be paid for. Buying on a candled or graded basis,\r\nusually not only means rots cut, but that a variation of the price\r\nis made for two or more grades of merchantable eggs.\r\n\r\nMuch discussion prevails among the western egg buyers as to whether\r\neggs should be bought loss off or case count. Loss off buying seems\r\nto be more desirable and just, but in practice is fraught with\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nIf the loss off buyer feels he is losing business, he may instruct\r\nhis candler to grade more closely, which means he will pay less.\r\nWhether done with honest or dishonest intention, the buyer thus sets\r\nthe price to be paid after he has the goods in his own hands, and\r\nthis is an obviously difficult commercial system.\r\n\r\nWhere the buyer in one case changes the grading basis to protect\r\nhimself, there are probably ten cases where the eggs really deserve\r\nthe loss charged; but the tenth chance gives the seller an\r\nopportunity to nurse his loss with the belief that he has been\r\nrobbed by the buyer. Such an uncertain feeling is disagreeable, and\r\nthe results are that where one or two competing egg dealers buys\r\nloss off, and the other case count, the case count man will get most\r\nof the business.\r\n\r\nThe case count method being the path of least resistance, the loss\r\noff system can only succeed where there is some factor that\r\novercomes the disinclination of a shipper to let the other man set\r\nthe price. This factor may be: 1st--An exceptional reputation of a\r\nparticular firm for honesty and fair dealing. 2d--Exceptional\r\nopportunities for selling fancy goods, enabling the loss off buyer\r\nto pay much higher rates for good stuff. 3d--A condition that\r\nprevails in the South in the summer, where the losses are so heavy\r\nthat the dealers will not take the risk involved in case count\r\nbuying. 4th--Some sort of a monopoly.\r\n\r\nA monopoly for enforcing the loss off system of buying has been\r\nbrought about in some sections of the West by agreement among egg\r\ndealers. In such cases the usual experience has been that some one\r\nwould get anxious for more business, and begin quoting case count,\r\nthe result being that he would get the business of the disgruntled\r\nshippers in his section. When one buyer begins quoting case count,\r\nthe remainder rapidly follow suit and case count buying is quickly\r\nre-established.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City Distribution of Eggs.\r\n\r\nIn name, city egg dealers are usually commission houses, but in\r\npractice the majority of large lots of eggs are now bought by\r\ntelegraph and the prices definitely known before shipment.\r\n\r\nIn the larger cities eggs are dealt in by a produce board of trade.\r\nSuch exchanges frequently have rules of grading and an official\r\ninspector. This gives stability to egg dealing and largely solves\r\nthe problem of uncertainty as to quality, so annoying to the country\r\nbuyer. In the city even, where official grading is not resorted to,\r\npersonal inspection of the lot by the buyer is practical, and one\r\nmay know what he is getting.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, especially in smaller cities, the receiver is the\r\njobber and sells to the grocers. In larger cities the receiver sells\r\nto a firm who makes a business of selling them to groceries,\r\nrestaurants, etc.\r\n\r\nThe jobber grades the eggs as the trade demands. In a western city\r\nthis may mean two grades--good and bad; in New York, it may mean\r\nseven or eight grades, and the finer of these ones being packed in\r\nsealed cartons, perhaps each egg stamped with the dealer's brand.\r\n\r\nThe city retailer of eggs include grocers, dairies, butcher shops,\r\nsoda fountains, hotels, restaurants and bakeries. The soda fountain\r\ntrade and the first-class hotel are among the high bidder for\r\nstrictly first-class eggs. Many such institutions in eastern cities\r\nare supplied directly from large poultry farms. The figures at which\r\nsuch eggs are purchased are frequently at a given premium above the\r\nmarket quotation, or a year round contract price for a given number\r\nof eggs per week. This premium over common farm eggs may range from\r\none or two cents in western cities, to five to twenty cents in New\r\nYork and Boston. An advance of ten cents over the quotation for\r\nextras or a year round contract price of thirty-five cents per\r\ndozen, might be considered typical of such arrangements in New York\r\nCity.\r\n\r\nSome of the larger chain grocers in New York City are in the market\r\nfor strictly fresh eggs and have even installed buying departments\r\nin charge of expert egg men.\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of eggs move through the channels of the small\r\nrestaurant, bakery and grocery. In the small cities of the Central\r\nWest the grocer handles eggs at a margin of one to three cents. In\r\nthe South and farther West the margin is two to seven cents, the\r\nretail price always being in the even nickel. In the large eastern\r\ncity there exists the custom unknown in the West of having two or\r\nmore grades of eggs for sale in the same store. All eggs offered for\r\nsale are claimed by the salesman to be \"strictly fresh\" or the\r\n\"best,\" and yet these eggs may vary if it be April from fifteen\r\ncents to forty cents, or if in December from thirty cents to\r\nseventy-five cents per dozen. The New York grocers' profit is from\r\ntwo to five cents on cheap eggs, but runs higher on high grade eggs,\r\nfrequently reach twenty cents a dozen and sometimes going as high as\r\nforty cents for very fancy stock.\r\n\r\nCity retailing is by far the most expensive item in the marketing of\r\neggs. As an illustration of the profits of the various handlers of\r\neggs might be as follows:\r\n\r\n        Paid the farmer in Iowa      $.15\r\n        Profit of country store       .00\r\n        Gross profit of shipper       .00-3/4\r\n        Freight to New York           .01-1/2\r\n        Gross profit of receiver      .00-1/2\r\n        Gross profit of jobber        .01-1/2\r\n        Loss from candling            .01-1/2\r\n        Gross profit of retailer      .04-1/2\r\n                                      -------\r\n        Cost to consumer              $.25\r\n\r\nThe cheapest grade of eggs sold are taken by bakeries and for\r\ncooking purposes at restaurants. When cooked with other food an egg\r\nmay have its flavor so covered up that a very repulsive specimen may\r\nbe used. Measures have been frequently taken by city boards of\r\nhealth to stop the sale of spot rots and other low grade eggs. The\r\ngreat difficulty with such regulations is that they are difficult of\r\nenforcement because no line of demarcation can be drawn as in the\r\ncase of adulterated or preserved products.\r\n\r\nThat embryo chicks and bacterially contaminated eggs are consumed by\r\nthe million cannot be doubted, but the individual examination of\r\neach egg sold would be the only way in which the food inspectors can\r\nprevent their use. The egg from the well-kept flock whose subsequent\r\nhandling has been conducted with intelligence and dispatch is the\r\nonly egg whose \"purity\" is assured with or without law. The\r\nencouragement of such production and such handling is the proper\r\nsphere of governmental regulations in regard to this product.\r\n\r\n\r\nCold Storage of Eggs.\r\n\r\nThe supply of eggs ranges from month to month, the heavy season of\r\nproduction centering about April and the lightest run being in\r\nNovember. The cold storage men begin storing eggs in March or April\r\nand continue to store heavily until June, after which time the\r\nquality deteriorates and does not keep well in storage. This storage\r\nstock begins to move out in September and should be cleaned up by\r\nDecember. Great loss may result if storage eggs are held too long.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the storage business is to even up the prices for the\r\nyear. The reduction of the exceedingly high winter prices is\r\nunfortunate for those who are skilled enough to produce many eggs at\r\nthat season of the year, but on a whole the storage business adds to\r\nthe wealth-producing powers of the hen, for it serves to increase\r\nthe annual consumption of eggs and prevents eggs from becoming a\r\ndrug on the market during the season of heavy production.\r\n\r\nMarch and April eggs are, in spite of a long period of storage, the\r\nbest quality of storage stock. This is accounted for by the fact\r\nthat owing to cooler weather and rising price eggs leave the farm in\r\nthe best condition at this season of the year.\r\n\r\nBecause eggs are spoiled by hard freezing, they must be kept at a\r\nhigher temperature than meat and butter. Temperatures of from 29\r\ndegrees to 30 degrees F. are used in cold storage of eggs. At such\r\ntemperatures the eggs, if kept in moist air, become moldy or musty.\r\nTo prevent this mustiness the air in a first class storage room is\r\nkept moderately dry. This shrinks the eggs, though much more slowly\r\nthan would occur without storage.\r\n\r\nThe growth of bacteria in cold storage is practically prevented, but\r\nif bacteria are in the eggs when stored they will lie dormant and\r\nbegin activity when the eggs are warmed up.\r\n\r\nOf the cold storage egg as a whole we can say it is a wholesome food\r\nproduct, though somewhat inferior in flavor and strength of white to\r\na fresh egg. The cold storage egg can be very nearly duplicated in\r\nappearance and quality by allowing eggs to stand for a week or two\r\nin a dry room. Cold storage eggs, when in case lots, can be told by\r\nthe candler because of the uniform shrinkage, the presence of mold\r\non cracked eggs and perhaps the occasional presence of certain kinds\r\nof spot rots peculiar to storage stock, but the absolute detection\r\nof a single cold storage egg, so far as the writer knows, is\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nIt may be further said that with the present prevailing custom of\r\nholding eggs without storage facilities for the fall rise of price,\r\neggs placed in cold storage in April are frequently superior to the\r\ncurrent fall and early winter receipts. Cold storage eggs are\r\ngenerally sold wholesale as cold storage goods, but are retailed as\r\n\"eggs.\" The fall eggs offered to the consumer cover every imaginable\r\nvariation in quality and the poorest ones sold may be a cold storage\r\nproduct, or they may not be.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Chemistry of the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture has recently announced the finding of certain crystals\r\nin the yolks of cold storage eggs that are not present in the fresh\r\nstock. This finding of a laboratory method of detecting cold storage\r\nstock was at first taken to be a great discovery. Further\r\ninvestigation, however, indicates that the crystal mentioned forms\r\nas the egg ages and that the rate of formation varies with the\r\nindividual eggs and probably also with the temperature, so that\r\nwhile crystals may indicate an aged egg, the discovery only means\r\nthat the microscopist in the laboratory can now do in a half hour\r\nwhat any egg candler in his booth can do in ten seconds.\r\n\r\nAt the present writing (February, 1909) there has been much talk of\r\nlaws against the sale of cold storage eggs as fresh. The Federal\r\nPure Food Commission, under the general law against misbranding,\r\nhave made one such prosecution. Many States have agitated such laws\r\nbut little or nothing has been done. I find that the idea of such a\r\nlaw is quite popular, especially with poultrymen. Contrary to\r\npopular opinion, the cold storage men and larger egg dealers are not\r\nopposed to the law. The people that are hit are the small dealers\r\nand especially the city grocers. These fellows buy the eggs at\r\nwholesale storage prices and sell them at retail prices for fresh,\r\nthus making excessive profits but cutting down the amount of the\r\nsales. This lessens the demand for storage stock and lowers the\r\nwholesale price. This is the reason the wholesaler and warehouse man\r\nare in favor of the law.\r\n\r\nWe may all grant that the opportunity given the small dealers to\r\ngrab quick gains and in so doing hurt the trade ought to be\r\nabolished. But how are we to do it? \"Have State and Federal branding\r\nof the cases as they go into or come out of storage,\" says one--an\r\nexcellent plan, to be sure by which the grocers could buy one case\r\nof fresh, eggs and a back room full of storage goods and do Elijah's\r\nflour barrel trick to perfection.\r\n\r\nClearly government inspection and stamping of each egg is the only\r\nmethod that would be effective and the consideration of what this\r\nmeans turns the whole matter into a joke. The official inspection\r\nnow maintained by the boards of trade of the larger cities may be\r\nextended and the producers, dealers and consuming public may be\r\neducated to appreciate quality in eggs, as they have been in dairy\r\nproducts. City and State laws may also be made which will taboo the\r\nsale of spot eggs or eggs that will float on water. Meanwhile, a\r\ngreat opportunity is open for the man who has high grade eggs for\r\nsale, whether he be producer or tradesman.\r\n\r\nMany eggs that would not do for ordinary storage are preserved by\r\ndirect freezing. These eggs are broken and carefully sorted and\r\nplaced in large cans and then frozen. Such a product is disposed of\r\nto bakers, confectioners and others desiring eggs in large\r\nquantities. Another method of preserving eggs is by evaporation.\r\nEvaporated or dried egg is, weight considered, about the most\r\nnourishing food product known. The chief value of such an article\r\nlies in provisioning inaccessible regions. There is no reason,\r\nhowever, why this product should not become a common article of diet\r\nduring the season of high prices of eggs. Dried eggs can be eaten as\r\ncustards, omelets, or similar dishes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreserving Eggs Out of Cold Storage.\r\n\r\nOccasional articles have been printed in agricultural papers calling\r\nattention to the fact that the cold storage men were reaping vast\r\nprofits which rightfully belonged to the farmer. Such writers advise\r\nthe farmer to send his own eggs to the storage house or to preserve\r\nthem by other means.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact the business of storing eggs has not of late\r\nyears been particularly profitable, there being severe losses during\r\nseveral seasons; Even were the profit of egg storing many times\r\ngreater than they are the above advice would still be unwise, for\r\nthe storing, removing and selling of a small quantity of eggs would\r\neat up all possible profit.\r\n\r\nThe only reliable methods of preserving eggs outside of cold storage\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\nLiming: Make a saturated solution of lime, to which salt may be\r\nadded, let it settle, dip off the clear liquid, put the eggs in\r\nwhile fresh, keep them submerged in the liquid and keep the liquid\r\nas cold as the available location will permit.\r\n\r\nWater glass: This is exactly the same as liming except that the\r\nsolution used is made by mixing ten per cent. of liquid water glass\r\nor sodium silicate with water.\r\n\r\nLiming eggs was formerly more popular than it is to-day. There are\r\nstill two large liming plants in this country and several in Canada.\r\nIn Europe both lime and water glass are used on a more extensive\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nAll limed or water glassed eggs can be told at a glance by an\r\nexperienced candler. They pop open when boiled. When properly\r\npreserved they are as well or better flavored than storage stock,\r\nbut the farmer or poultryman will make frequent mistakes and thus\r\nthrow lots of positively bad eggs on the market. These eggs must be\r\nsold at a low price themselves, and by their presence cast suspicion\r\non all eggs, thus tending to suppress the price paid to the\r\nproducers. The farmers' efforts to preserve eggs has in this way\r\nacted as a boomerang, and have in the long run caused more loss than\r\ngain to the producers.\r\n\r\nFor the poultryman with his own special outlet for high grade goods,\r\nthe use of pickling or cold storage is generally not to be\r\nconsidered for fear of hurting his trade. Any scheme that would help\r\nto overcome the difficulty of getting sufficient fresh eggs to\r\nsupply such customers in the season of scarcity would be of great\r\nadvantage. The proposition of pickling a limited number of eggs and\r\nselling them for \"cooking\" purposes, explaining just what they are,\r\nought to offer something of a solution, although, to the writer's\r\nknowledge, it has not been done.\r\n\r\n\r\nImproved Methods of Marketing Farm-Grown Eggs.\r\n\r\nThe loss to the farmers of this country from the careless handling\r\nof eggs is something enormous. No great or sudden change in this\r\nstate of affairs can be brought about, but a few points on how this\r\nloss may be averted will not be out of order.\r\n\r\nNumerous efforts have recently been made in western states to\r\nprevent the sale of bad eggs by law. Minnesota began this work by\r\narresting several farmers and dealers. The parties invariably\r\npleaded guilty. A number of other States followed the example of\r\nMinnesota in challenging the sale of rotten eggs, but few\r\nprosecutions were made.\r\n\r\nSuch laws mean well enough, but the only efficient means of\r\nenforcing them would be to have food inspectors who are trained as\r\npractical candlers.\r\n\r\nThe present usefulness of the laws is in calling the attention of\r\nthe farmer to the mistake that he may be carelessly committing, and\r\nin placing over him a fear of possible disgrace in case of arrest\r\nand prosecution.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the law is the difficulty of its enforcement because\r\nof the number of violations, and the difficulty of drawing distinct\r\nlines in regard to which eggs are to be considered unlawful.\r\n\r\nEducation of the farmer as to the situation is, of course, the\r\nsurest means of preventing the loss, but the education of ten\r\nmillions of farmers is easier to suggest than to execute. The most\r\neffective plan of education would be the introduction of a method of\r\nbuying eggs similar to the one in vogue in Denmark, in which every\r\nproducer is paid strictly in accordance with the quality of his\r\neggs.\r\n\r\nWith our complicated system involving five to six dealers between\r\nthe producer and the consumer, such a system is well nigh\r\nimpossible. With the introduction of co-operative buying or the\r\ncommunity system of production, paying for quality becomes entirely\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nFor enterprising farming communities, the following plans offer a\r\ncure for the evil of general store buying that take good and bad\r\nalike and causes the worthy farmer to suffer for the carelessness\r\nand dishonesty of his neighbor.\r\n\r\nFirst: The encouragement of the cash buying of produce, and, if\r\npossible, the candling of all eggs with proper deduction for loss.\r\n\r\nSecond: The buying of eggs by co-operative creameries. The greatest\r\ndifficulty in this has been the opposition of the merchants, who\r\nthrough numerous ways available in a small town, may retaliate and\r\ninjure the creamery patronage to an extent greater than the newly\r\ninstalled egg business will repay.\r\n\r\nThird: The agreement of the merchants to turn all egg buying over to\r\na single produce buyer. This has been successfully done in a few\r\ninstances, but there are not many towns in which those interested\r\nwill stick to such an agreement. The worst fault with this plan is\r\nthat the moment the egg buyer is given a monopoly he is tempted to\r\nlower the farmer's prices for the purpose of increasing his own\r\nprofits.\r\n\r\nFourth: A modification of the above scheme is the case in which the\r\nproduce buyer is on a salary and in the employment of the merchants.\r\nThis scheme has been successfully carried into effect in some\r\nNebraska towns. It may be the ultimate solution of the egg buying in\r\nthe West. It eliminates the temptation of the buyer to use his\r\nprivilege of monopoly to fatten his own pocket-book. The weakness of\r\nthe plan is that a salaried man's efficiency in the close bargaining\r\nnecessary to sell the goods is inferior to that of the man trading\r\nfor himself. Other difficulties are: Getting a group of merchants\r\nwho will live up to such an agreement; the farmers object to driving\r\nto two places; the competition of other towns; the merchants'\r\nrealization that, the farmer with cash in his pocket or a check good\r\nat all stores, is not as certain a trader as one standing, egg\r\nbasket on arm, before the counter; and last, and most convincing,\r\nthe merchant's further realization that any fine Saturday morning,\r\nwith eggs selling at fifteen cents at the produce house, he may\r\nstick out a card \"Sixteen Cents Paid for Eggs\" and make more money\r\nin one day than his competitors did all week.\r\n\r\nFifth: Co-operative egg buying by the farmers themselves. This has\r\nbeen discussed in a previous chapter. It is all right in localities\r\nwhere the business is big enough to warrant it and the farmers are\r\nintelligent and enthusiastic to back it up and stick to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe High Grade Egg Business.\r\n\r\nThere are many excellent opportunities for men of moderate capital\r\nand ability in the high grade egg trade. The produce business on its\r\npresent line, either at the country end or at the city end, is as\r\nopen as any well-known form of business enterprise can be. The\r\nchances of success for a man new to the trade will be better,\r\nhowever, if he can find a niche in the business where he may crowd\r\nin and establish himself before the old firms realize what is up.\r\nThe proposition of buying high grade eggs from producers and selling\r\ndirect to consumers is a proposition of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe little game of existence is chiefly one of apeing our betters\r\nand strutting before the lesser members of the flock. The large\r\ncities are full of people in search of some way to display their\r\nsuperior wealth, taste and exclusiveness. If an ingenious dealer\r\ntakes a dozen eggs from common candled stock, places them in a blue\r\nlined box and labels them \"Exquisite Ovarian Deposital,\" he can sell\r\nquite a few of them at a long price, but the game has its limits.\r\nNow, let this man secure a truly high grade article from reliable\r\nproducers, teach his customers the points that actually distinguish\r\nhis eggs from common stock, and he can get not only the sucker trade\r\nabove referred to but a more satisfactory and permanent trade from\r\nthat class of people who are willing to pay for genuine superiority\r\nbut whose ears have not quite grown through their hats.\r\n\r\nAn express messenger running out of St. Louis became interested in\r\nthe egg trade. He arranged with a few country friends to ship him\r\ntheir eggs. These he candled in his house cellar and began selling\r\nthem to a limited trade in the wealthy section of the city. At first\r\nhe delivered the eggs himself. This was in the World's Fair year of\r\n1904. In 1908 he did a $100,000 worth of business and his type of\r\nbusiness shows a much better percentage of profit than that of the\r\nordinary type of dealer.\r\n\r\nIn Chicago, one of the large dairy companies established an egg\r\ndepartment and placed a young man in charge of it. The eggs in this\r\ncase are not bought of farmers but are secured from country produce\r\nbuyers whom the Chicago company have encouraged to educate their\r\nfarmers to bring in a high grade of goods. These people buy their\r\neggs in Tennessee in the winter and in Minnesota in the summer, thus\r\ngetting the best eggs the year round. They sell by wagon on regular\r\nroutes. The business is growing nicely and pays good profits.\r\n\r\nOther similar concerns are operating in Chicago and other large\r\ncities. They are not numerous, however, and there is room for more.\r\nThe reason the business has not been overdone is chiefly because of\r\nthe difficulty of getting sufficiently really high grade eggs in the\r\nseason of scarcity. Southern winter eggs are destined to relieve\r\nthis situation more and more.\r\n\r\nAnother great difficulty with a plan that attempts to buy eggs\r\ndirectly from the producer is that premium offered on the goods\r\ntempts the farmer to go out and buy up eggs from his neighbors. This\r\nbrings disastrous results in the quality of the goods and the farmer\r\nmust be dropped from the list. In order to make a success, a system\r\nof buying directly from producers must be based upon a grading\r\nscheme that will pay for the actual quality of the eggs. No fear\r\nthen need be exercised as to whether the farmer sells his own eggs\r\nor those of his neighbor.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from Farmer's Bulletin 128 of the U.S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture has been used as advertising \"dope\" in the\r\nsale of high grade eggs:\r\n\r\n\"Under certain conditions eggs may be the cause of illness by\r\ncommunicating some bacterial disease or some parasite. It is\r\npossible for an egg to become infected with micro-organisms, either\r\nbefore it is laid or after. The shell is porous, and offers no\r\ngreater resistance to micro-organisms which cause disease than it\r\ndoes to those which cause the egg to spoil or rot. When the infected\r\negg is eaten raw the microorganisms, if present, are communicated to\r\nman and may cause disease. If an egg remains in a dirty nest,\r\ndefiled with the micro-organisms which cause typhoid fever, carried\r\nthere on the hen's feet or feathers, it is not strange if some of\r\nthese bacteria occasionally penetrate the shell and the egg thus\r\nbecomes a possible source of infection. Perhaps one of the most\r\ncommon troubles due to bacterial infection of eggs is the more or\r\nless serious illness sometimes caused by eating those which are\r\n'stale.' This often resembles ptomaine poisoning, which is caused,\r\nnot by micro-organisms themselves, but by the poisonous products\r\nwhich they elaborate from materials on which they grow.\r\n\r\n\"In view of this possibility, it is best to keep eggs as clean as\r\npossible and thus endeavor to prevent infection. Clean\r\npoultry-houses, poultry-runs and nests are important, and eggs\r\nshould always be stored and marketed under sanitary conditions. The\r\nsubject of handling food in a cleanly manner is given entirely too\r\nlittle attention.\"\r\n\r\nThe reprint upon the succeeding pages will give some idea of the\r\nadvertising literature used in selling high grade eggs. This is a\r\ncopy of a hand-bill inserted in the egg boxes of a prominent Chicago\r\ndealer:\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                MOORE'S BREAKFAST EGGS\r\n\r\nare guaranteed to be perfect in quality when you receive them\r\nand to remain so until all eaten up. If for any reason they\r\nare not satisfactory return the Eggs to your dealer and get\r\nyour money back.\r\n\r\n(Signature.)\r\n\r\n                    WE URGE YOU\r\n\r\nto assist us in our endeavor to furnish you at all times with\r\nthe finest Eggs by being careful to\r\n\r\n                   KEEP THEM DRY\r\n\r\nA damp \"filler\" will in 24 hours make the finest fresh Eggs\r\ntaste like old Cold Storage Eggs.\r\n\r\nThe flavor of an Egg cannot be detected even by the powerful\r\nelectric lights used to inspect every Egg in this package,\r\nso it might be possible for a \"strong\" Egg to get by our inspectors,\r\nbut in the past the cause of nearly every complaint\r\nhas been traced to the consumer's ice box or pantry window\r\nsill.\r\n\r\n                     REMEMBER\r\n\r\nEggs are 25c-40c per doz. retail only when fine Eggs are\r\nscarce. Ordinarily we can get a sufficient supply from the\r\nfarmers bringing milk daily to the creameries where we make\r\nDelicia Pure Cream Butter, but in times of scarcity we often\r\nhave to go as far as Oklahoma, Arkansas or Tennessee to find\r\nthe best Eggs. These are not equal to our creamery Eggs but\r\nare the freshest and best to be had and are vastly superior to\r\nthe old Cold Storage Eggs that flood the market at such times.\r\n\r\n    Be Sure This Seal is Unbroken When You Get the Eggs\r\n\r\n                 W. S. MOORE & CO.,\r\n\r\n        Chicago Office--131 South Water Street.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuying Eggs By Weight.\r\n\r\nWhenever an improved method of buying is installed, eggs should be\r\nbought of the producer by weight. As far as selling to the consumer\r\nis concerned, the present scheme is more feasible; this scheme is to\r\ngrade according to the size and other qualities, and sell by the\r\ndozen, the price per dozen varying according to the grade.\r\n\r\nBuying by weight simplifies the problem of grading. It will, in\r\naddition, only be necessary to have a fine of so much for eggs that\r\nare wrong in quality. For rotten or heated eggs should be deducted\r\nan amount considerably in excess of their value, for their presence\r\nis a source of danger to the reputation of the brand. Shrunken eggs\r\nare hard to classify. In order that this may be done fairly and\r\nuniformly the specific gravity or brine test should be used. All\r\neggs that float in a given salt brine of, say, 1.05 specific gravity\r\nshould be fined. Two or more grades can be made in this fashion if\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Retailing of Eggs by the Producer.\r\n\r\nIn poultry papers the poultryman has been commonly advised to get\r\nnear a large city and retail his own eggs at a fancy price. This\r\nsounds all right on paper but in practice it works out differently.\r\nA man cannot be in two places or do two things at the same time. The\r\npoultryman's time is valuable on his plant, and the question is\r\nwhether he can handle city sales as well as a man who made it his\r\nbusiness. If the poultryman tries to retail his own goods he will be\r\nworking on too small a scale to advertise his goods or to make\r\ndeliveries economically. The man making a specialty of the city end\r\ncan sell ten to a hundred times as much produce as one poultryman\r\ncan produce.\r\n\r\nWith a group of poultry farmers working co-operatively, or a large\r\ncorporation having contracts with producers, the producing and\r\nselling end can be brought under the same management advantageously.\r\nThe isolated poultryman, unless he find a market at his very door,\r\nwill do better to permit at least one middleman to slip in between\r\nhimself and the consumer. But there is no reason why he should not\r\nknow this middleman personally and insist upon a method of buying\r\nthat will pay him upon the merits of his goods.\r\n\r\nConsigning eggs or any other produce to commission men, without a\r\ndefinite understanding, will always be, as it always has been, a\r\nsource of dissatisfaction and loss. There is a great opportunity\r\nhere for the man who can organize a system that shall do away with\r\ncommission houses, other intermediate steps, and form the single\r\nstep from producer to consumer. Some people say that farmers cannot\r\nbe dealt with in this manner. Such people would probably have said\r\nas much about general merchandising before the days of the mail\r\norder houses.\r\n\r\nIt is all a matter of efficient organization. A system of business\r\nfitted to deal in carload lots will, of course, fail when dealing\r\nwith half cases. It is more difficult to deal in little things than\r\nin big ones because the margin is closer, but it can and will be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Price of Eggs.\r\n\r\nWe will consider the price of all eggs from the quotation of Western\r\nfirsts in the New York market. The reason for this is evident. Every\r\negg raised east of Colorado is in line for shipment to New York. If\r\nother towns get eggs they must pay sufficiently to keep them from\r\ngoing to New York.\r\n\r\nIn pricing eggs we have first to consider the price of Western\r\nfirsts in New York and secondly the quality relation of the\r\nparticular grade to Western firsts and the consequent relation in\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nThe price of eggs varies with the price of other commodities as the\r\nperiods of prosperity and adversity follow one another through the\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, all prices in the '90's passed through a period of\r\ndepression. For eggs this reached a base in 1897. Since then there\r\nhas been a gradual climb till this realized a high point in 1904,\r\nremained high till 1907. In the spring of 1908 egg prices dropped\r\nagain, but the fall prices of 1908 were exceptionally high. As this\r\nwork goes to press (May, 1909) eggs are going into storage at the\r\nhighest May price on record.\r\n\r\nThe prices of eggs also vary independently of other commodities\r\nbecause of a gradual changing relation between production and\r\nconsumption. As stated in the first chapter the prices of poultry\r\nproducts have shown a general rise when compared with other\r\narticles. This has been most marked since 1900. As for the future we\r\ncannot prophesy save to say that there is nothing in sight to lead\r\nus to believe that we will not go still higher in egg prices.\r\n\r\nA third variation in the price of eggs is the one caused by the\r\nseasonal relation of production and consumption. This change is from\r\nyear to year fairly constant. Its normal may be seen in the\r\nscientifically smoothed curve in plate IV. This curve is based upon\r\nthe New York prices for the last eighteen years.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these broader influences there are disturbing\r\ntendencies that cause the market to fluctuate back and forth across\r\nthe line where the more general influences would place it.\r\n\r\nOf those general factors, weather is the most important. Storms,\r\nrain and cold in the egg producing region decrease the lay, lower\r\nsupplies and raise the price. This is due both to the fact that\r\nlaying is cut down and that the country roads become impassable and\r\nthe farmers do not bring the eggs to town. As long as there are\r\nstorage eggs in the warehouses weather conditions are not so\r\neffective, but when these are gone, which is usually about the first\r\nof the year, the egg market becomes highly sensitive to all weather\r\nchanges. Suppose late in February storms and snows force up the\r\nprice of eggs. This is followed by a warm spell which starts the\r\nMarch lay. The roads, meanwhile, are in a quagmire from melting\r\nsnows. When they do dry up eggs come to town by the wagon loads. A\r\ndrop of ten cents or more may occur on such occasions within a day\r\nor two's time. This is known as the spring drop and for one to get\r\ncaught with eggs on hand means heavy losses.\r\n\r\nWhen once eggs have suffered this drop to the spring level or the\r\nstorage price for the season, the prices for April, May and June\r\nwill remain fairly steady. About the last week in June the summer\r\nclimb begins. This goes on very steadily with local variation of\r\nabout the same as those of the spring months. The storage eggs begin\r\nto come out in August and at first sell about the same as fresh. As\r\nthe season advances the fresh product continues to rise in price.\r\nThe storage egg price will remain fairly uniform. By November the season\r\nof high prices is reached. If storage eggs are still plentiful and the\r\nweather is mild sudden variations in price may occur. These are caused\r\nby a fear that the storage eggs will not all be consumed before spring.\r\nIf an oversupply of eggs have been stored a warm spell in winter will\r\nmake a heavy drop in the market, but if storage eggs are scarce the\r\nsudden variations will be up-shots due to cold waves. From November\r\nuntil spring egg prices are a creature of the weather maps and sudden\r\njumps from 5 to 10 cents may occur at any time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate IV. Page 159. Graphs of egg prices and volume\r\nof egg sales as they vary throughout the year.]\r\n\r\nThe price curve of 1908, which is represented by the dotted line in\r\nplate IV will illustrate these general principles. In the lower\r\nportion of plate IV is given the curves for the New York receipts.\r\nThe heavy line represents the smoothed or normal curve, deduced from\r\neighteen years' statistics and calculated for the year 1908. The\r\ndotted line shows the actual receipts of 1908. A comparison week by\r\nweek of the receipts and price will show the detailed workings of\r\nthe law of supply and demand.\r\n\r\nAside from the weather there are other factors that perceptibly\r\naffect the receipts and price of eggs. A high price of meat will\r\nincrease farm and village consumption of eggs and cut down the\r\nreceipts that reach the city. Abundance of fruit in the city market\r\nwill cut down the demand for eggs. A cold, wet spring will increase\r\nthe mortality of chicks and cause a decreased egg yield the\r\nfollowing season, due to a scarcity of pullets. Scarcity and high\r\nprice of feed will cut down the egg yield. High price of hens is\r\nsaid by some to cut down the egg yield, but I think this is\r\ndoubtful, as the impulse to sell off the hens is counteracted by the\r\ndesire to \"keep 'em and raise more.\"\r\n\r\nThe following are the quotations taken from the New York\r\nPrice-Current for November 14, 1908:\r\n\r\nState, Pennsylvania and nearby fresh eggs continue in very small\r\nsupply and of more or less irregular quality, a good many being\r\nmixed with held eggs--sometimes with pickled stock. The few new laid\r\nlots received direct from henneries command extreme\r\nprices--sometimes working out in a small way above any figures that\r\ncould fairly be quoted as a wholesale value.

These\r\nwere commonly retailed at 5 cents each. There were a good many\r\nbrands retailing at 65 cents and one of the largest high class\r\ngroceries was selling for 70 cents. This is practically double the\r\nofficial quotations and three times that of cold storage stock.\r\n\r\nThe above prices represent a fair sample of the fall prices of 1908.\r\nIt should be noted that the 1908 fall prices were relatively\r\nsomewhat better than the rest of the season.\r\n\r\nThe time of high prices is also the time of the greatest variation\r\nin the price of the different grades. In the springtime all eggs are\r\nfairly fresh and good, and the fanciest eggs bring wholesale only\r\ntwo or three cents above quotations. There are a few retailers who\r\nhold the spring prices to their customers up above the general\r\nmarket. One New York firm that does a large high class egg business\r\nnever lets their price at any season go below 40 cents. This, of\r\ncourse, means big profits and sales only to those who, when they are\r\nsatisfied, never bother about price.\r\n\r\nIn the fall any man who has fresh eggs can sell them at very near\r\nthe highest price, but in the spring only a small per cent. can go\r\nat fancy prices and the great majority of even the high grade eggs\r\nmust go at very ordinary prices. In the summer months there is not\r\nso much demand in the cities, as the wealthy are not there to buy.\r\nThe coast and mountain resorts are then good markets for fancy\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nBREEDS OF CHICKENS\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not place much dependence on the results of breed tests.\r\nIndeed, I consider the almost universal use of the Barred Rock in\r\nthe most productive farm poultry regions in the United States, and\r\nthe equal predominance of S.C. White Leghorns on the egg farms of\r\nNew York and California, as far more conclusive than any possible\r\nbreed tests.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreed Tests.\r\n\r\nIn Australia there has been conducted a series of breed tests so\r\nremarkable and extensive that the writer considers them well worth\r\nquoting. The Hawkesbury Agricultural College tests extend over a\r\nperiod of five years, the pens entered were of six birds each, and\r\nthe time one year. The results were as follows:\r\n\r\n            No. of Pens    Yield of     Average Yield\r\n            Competing     Highest Pen    of All Pens\r\n\r\n    1903 ...    70           218            163\r\n    1904 ...   100           204            152\r\n    1905 ...   100           235            162\r\n    1906 ...   100           247            177\r\n    1907 ...    60           245            173\r\n\r\nThe winners and losers for five years were as follows:\r\n\r\n            Winning Pen        Losing Pen\r\n\r\n    1903  Silver Wyandotte   Silver Wyandotte\r\n    1904  Silver Wyandotte   Partridge Wyandotte\r\n    1905  S.C.W. Leghorns    S.C.W. Leghorns\r\n    1906  Black Langshans    Golden Wyandotte\r\n    1907  S.C.W. Leghorns    S.C.B. Leghorns\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the winning pen means little for breed\r\ncomparison. This is shown by the winning and losing pens frequently\r\nbeing of the same breed.\r\n\r\nThe average for hens of one breed for the whole five years is more\r\nenlightening. For the three most popular Australian breeds, these\r\ngrand averages are:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       Average      Av. Wt. Eggs.\r\n                           No. Hens    Egg Yield    Oz. Per Doz.\r\n\r\n    S.C.W. Leghorns   ...  564         175.5         26.4\r\n\r\n    Black Orpingtons  ...  522         166.6         26.1\r\n\r\n    Silver Wyandottes ...  474         161.1         24.9\r\n\r\n\r\nThese figures are undoubtedly the most trustworthy breed comparisons\r\nthat have ever been obtained. When we go into the other breeds,\r\nhowever, with smaller numbers entered, the results show chance\r\nvariation and become untrustworthy, for illustration: R.C. Brown\r\nLeghorns, with 42 birds entered, have an average of 176.4. This does\r\nnot signify that the R.C. Browns are better than the S.S. Whites,\r\nfor if the Whites were divided by chance into a dozen lots of\r\nsimilar size, some would undoubtedly have surpassed the R.C. Browns.\r\nAs further proof, take the case of the R.C.W. Leghorns with 36 birds\r\nentered and an egg yield of 166.9. Both breeds are probably a little\r\npoorer layers than S.C. Whites, but luck was with the R.C. Browns\r\nand against the R.C. Whites. For a discussion of this principle of\r\nthe worth of averages from different sized flocks see Chapter XV.\r\n\r\nAll Leghorns in the tests with 846 birds entered, averaged 170.3\r\neggs each. All of the general purpose breeds (Rocks, Wyandottes,\r\nReds and Orpingtons), with 1416 birds entered, averaged 160.2. The\r\ncomparison between the Leghorns and the general purpose fowls as\r\nclasses is undoubtedly a fair one. A study of the relations between\r\nthe leading breeds in these groups and the general average of these\r\ngroups is worth while. It bears out the writer's statement that the\r\nbest fowls of a group or breed are to be found in the popular\r\nvariety of that breed. The Australian poultryman, wanting utility\r\nonly, would do wise to choose out of the three great Australian\r\nbreeds here mentioned. The S.C.W. Leghorn is the only one of the\r\nthree breeds to which the advice would apply in America. Barred\r\nRocks and perhaps White Wyandottes, would here represent the other\r\ntypes.\r\n\r\nThere is one more point in the Australian records worthy of especial\r\nmention. The winning pen in 1906 were Black Langshans and, what\r\nseems still more remarkable, were daughters of birds purchased from\r\nthe original home of Langshans in North China. Other pens of\r\nLangshans in the test failed to make remarkable records, but this\r\npen of Chinese stock, with a record of 246 5-6* eggs per hen for the\r\nfirst year and 414 1-2* eggs per hen for two years, is the world's\r\nrecord layers beyond all quibble. This record is held by a breed and\r\na region in which we would not expect to find great layers.\r\n\r\nThis holding of the record by a breed hitherto not considered a\r\nlaying type, would be comparable to a tenderfoot bagging the pots in\r\nan Arizona gambling den. If the latter incident should occur and be\r\nheralded in the papers it would be no proof that it would pay\r\nanother Eastern youth to rush out to Arizona. It is probable that\r\nthe man who, on the strength of this single record, stocks an egg\r\nfarm with imported Chinese Langshans, will fare as the second\r\ntenderfoot.\r\n\r\nThe year following the Langshan winning, the first eleven winning\r\npens were all S.C.W. Leghorns. This is also remarkable--much more\r\nremarkable in fact than the Langshans record. It is like a royal\r\nflush in a poker game. Standing alone, this would be very suggestive\r\nevidence of the eminence of the breed. Standing as it does, with the\r\ncombined evidence of years and numbers, it gives the S.C.W. Leghorn\r\nhen the same reputation in Australia as she has in America and\r\nDenmark--that of being the greatest egg machine ever created.\r\n\r\nIsolated evidence is misleading. Accumulated evidence is convincing.\r\nThe difference between the scientist and the enthusiast is that the\r\nformer knows the difference between these two classes of evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hen's Ancestors.\r\n\r\nTo one who is unfamiliar with the different types of chickens found\r\nin a poultry showroom, it seems incredible that these varieties\r\nshould have descended from one parent source. It was, however, held\r\nby Darwin that all domestic chickens were sprung from a single\r\nspecies of Indian jungle fowl. Other scientists have since disputed\r\nDarwin's conclusion, but it does not seem to the writer that the\r\norigin of domestic fowls from more than one wild variety makes the\r\nchanges that have taken place under domestication any less\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\nThe buff, white and dominique colors, unheard of in wild species,\r\nfrizzles with their feathers all awry, the Polish with their\r\ndeformed skulls and the sooty fowls whose skin and bones are black,\r\nare some of the remarkable characters that have sprung up and been\r\npreserved under domestication. The varieties of domestic fowl form\r\none of the most profound exhibits of man's control over the laws of\r\ninheritance. What makes these wonders all the more inexplicable is\r\nthat these profound changes were accomplished in an age when a\r\nscientific study of breeding was a thing unheard of.\r\n\r\nThe wild chicken whom Darwin credits as the parent of the modern\r\ngallinaceous menagerie, is smaller than modern fowls and is colored\r\nin a manner similar to the Black-breasted Game. The habits of this\r\nbird are like those of the quail and prairie-chicken, both of which\r\nbelong to the same zoological family.\r\n\r\nFrom its natural home in India the chicken spread east and west.\r\nChinese poultry culture is ancient. In China, as well as in India,\r\nthe chief care seems to have been to breed very large fowls, and\r\nfrom these countries all the large, heavily feathered and feather\r\nlegged chickens of the modern world have come.\r\n\r\nPoultry is also known to have been bred in the early Babylonian and\r\nEgyptian periods. Here, however, the progress was in a different\r\nline from that of China. Artificial incubation was early developed,\r\nand the selection was for birds that produced eggs continually,\r\nrather than for those that laid fewer eggs and brooded in the\r\nnatural manner.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian type of chicken spread to the countries bordering on\r\nthe Mediterranean, and from Southern Europe our non-sitting breeds\r\nof fowls have been imported. Throughout the countries of Northern\r\nEurope minor differences were developed. The French chickens were\r\nselected for the quality of the meat, while in Poland the peculiar\r\ntop-knotted breed is supposed to have been formed.\r\n\r\nThe English Dorking is one of the oldest of European breeds and is\r\npossessed of five toes. Five-toed fowls were reported in Rome and\r\nexist to-day in Turkey and Japan. The Dorkings may be descended\r\ndirectly from the Roman fowls, or various strains of five-toed fowls\r\nmay have arisen independently from the preservation of sports.\r\n\r\nThe chief point to be noted in all European poultry is that it\r\ndiffers from Asiatic poultry in being smaller, lighter feathered,\r\nquicker maturing, of greater egg-producing capacity, less disposed\r\nto become broody, and more active than the Asiatic fowl.\r\n\r\nThe early American hens were of European origin, but of no fixed\r\nbreeds. About 1840 Italian chickens began to be imported. These,\r\nwith stock from Spain, have been bred for fixed types of form and\r\ncolor, and constitute our Mediterranean or non-sitting breeds of the\r\npresent day. Soon after the importation of Italian chickens a chance\r\nimportation was made from Southeastern Asia. These Asiatic chickens\r\nwere quite different from anything yet seen, and further\r\nimportations followed.\r\n\r\nPoultry-breeding soon became the fashion. The first poultry show was\r\nheld in Boston in the early '50's. The Asiatic fowls imported were\r\ngray or yellowish-red in color, and were variously known as the\r\nBrahmapootras, Cochin-Chinas and Shanghais. With the rapid\r\ndevelopment of poultry-breeding there came a desire to produce new\r\nvarieties. Every conceivable form of cross-breeding was resorted to.\r\nThe great majority of breeds and varieties as they exist to-day are\r\nthe results of crosses followed by a few years of selection for the\r\ndesired form and color. Many of our common breeds still give us\r\noccasional individuals that resemble some of the types from which\r\nthe breed was formed. The exact history of the formation of the\r\nAmerican or mixed breeds is in dispute, but it is certain that they\r\nhave been formed from a complex mixing of blood from both European\r\nand Asiatic sources.\r\n\r\nThe English have recently furnished the world with a very popular\r\nbreed which was originated by the same methods. I refer to the\r\nOrpingtons.\r\n\r\nThe ever growing multiplicity of varieties of chicken is in reality\r\nonly casually related to the business of the poultryman whose object\r\nis the production of human food.\r\n\r\nBreeding as an art or vocation, is a source of endless pleasure to\r\nman, and as such, is as worthy of encouragement as is painting,\r\nmusic, or the collection of the bones of prehistoric animals.\r\nBreeding as an art has produced many forms of chickens that are\r\nentirely worthless as food producers, but this same group of poultry\r\nbreeders, tempered to be sure by the demands of commercialism, have\r\nproduced other breeds that are certainly superior for the various\r\ncommercial purposes to the unselected fowls of the old-fashioned\r\nfarm-yard.\r\n\r\nThe mongrel chicken is a production of chance. Its ancestry\r\nrepresents everything available in the barn-yard of the\r\nneighborhood, and its offspring will be equally varied. In the pure\r\nbreeds there has been a rigid selection practiced that gives uniform\r\nappearance. The size and shape requirements of the standard,\r\nalthough not based on the market demands, come much nearer producing\r\nan ideal carcass than does chance breeding. Ability to mature for\r\nthe fall shows is a decidedly practical quality that the fancier\r\nbreeds into his chickens. Moreover, poultry-breeders, while still\r\nkeeping standard points in mind, have also made improvements in the\r\nlay and meat-producing qualities of their chickens. Considering\r\nthese facts it is an erroneous idea to think that mongrel chickens\r\noffer any advantage over pure bred stock.\r\n\r\nIn the broader sense we may regard as pure-bred those animals that\r\nreproduce their shape, color, habits, or other distinctive qualities\r\nwith uniformity. In order that we may get offspring like the parent\r\nand like each other we must have animals whose ancestors for many\r\ngenerations back have been of one type. The more generations of such\r\nuniformity, the more certain it will be that the young will possess\r\nsimilar quality.\r\n\r\nOne strain of chickens may be selected for uniform color of\r\nfeathers, another for a certain size and shape, another for laying\r\nlarge eggs of a certain color, and yet another strain for being\r\nproducers of many eggs. Each of these strains might be well-bred in\r\nthese particular traits, but would be mongrels when the other\r\nconsiderations were taken into account.\r\n\r\nThis explains to us why the family or strains is frequently more\r\nimportant than the breed. In fact, the whole series of breed\r\nclassification is arbitrary. This is especially true of the American\r\nor mixed breeds. Humorously turned fanciers at the poultry show\r\nfrequently have much sport trying to get other fanciers to tell\r\nWhite or Buff Rocks from Wyandottes, when the heads are hidden. From\r\nthe dressed carcasses with feet and head removed, the finest set of\r\npoultry judges in the world would be hopelessly lost in a collection\r\nof Rocks, Wyandottes, Reds and Orpingtons and, I dare say, one could\r\nrun in a few Langshans and Minorcas if it were not for their black\r\npin feathers.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Breed.\r\n\r\nThe writer has great admiration for breeding as an art. He would\r\nrather be the originator of a breed of green chickens with six toes,\r\nthan to have been the author of \"Afraid to Go Home in the Dark.\" But\r\nI do want the novice who reads this book to be spared some of the\r\nmental throes usually indulged in over the selection of a breed.\r\n\r\nSo-called meat breeds, that is, the big feather legged Asiatics save\r\non a few capon and roaster plants in New England, are really\r\nuseless. They have given size to American chickens as a class, and\r\nin that have served a useful purpose, but standing alone they cannot\r\ncompete with lighter, quick growing breeds.\r\n\r\nFor commercial consideration there are really but two types: The egg\r\nbreeds of Mediterranean origin and the general purpose breeds or\r\ngrowers, including the Rocks, Wyandottes and Rhode Island Reds. The\r\ndifference between the layers on the one hand and the growers on the\r\nother, is quite important. Which should be used depends on the\r\nlocation and plan of operations, as has already been discussed.\r\n\r\nThe choice of variety within the group is a matter of taste and\r\nchance of sales of fancy stock. This one principle can, however, be\r\nlaid down: The more popular the breed, the more choice there will be\r\nin selecting strains and individuals. Pea Comb Plymouth Rocks and\r\nDuckwing Leghorns should not be considered because of their rarity.\r\nOf the growers, their popularity and claims are close enough to make\r\nthe particular choice unimportant. For commercial consideration, the\r\nwriter would as soon invest his money in a flock of Barred Rock,\r\nWhite Wyandottes or Rhode Island Reds. Among layers the S. C. White\r\nhas achieved such a lead that the majority of good laying strains\r\nare in this breed and to choose any other would be to place a\r\nhandicap on oneself. For a description of breeds, the reader should\r\nsecure an Illustrated American Standard of Perfection, or some of\r\nthe books published by poultry fanciers and judges. To take up the\r\nmatter here would merely be using my space for imparting knowledge\r\nwhich can be better secured elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe relative popularity of breeds at the poultry shows is nicely\r\nshown by the following list. This data was compiled by adding the\r\nnumbers of each breed exhibited at 124 different poultry shows in\r\nthe season of 1907. A detailed report of the total entries of each\r\nbreed is as follows: Plymouth Rocks, 14,514; Wyandottes, 12,320;\r\nLeghorns, 8,740; Rhode Island Reds, 5,812; Orpingtons, 2,857;\r\nLangshans, 2,153; Minorcas, 1,709; Cochin Bantams, 1,590; Games,\r\n1,277; Brahmas, 1,181; Cochins, 1,010; Hamburgs, 758; Game Bantams,\r\n637; Polish, 618; Houdans, 538; Indians, 538; Anconas, 464; Sebright\r\nBantams, 423; Andalusians, 117; Japanese Bantams, 115; Dorkings,\r\n105; Brahma Bantams, 104; Buckeyes, 95; Silkies, 85; Spanish, 83;\r\nRedcaps, 71; Sumatras, 41; Polish Bantams, 37; Sultans, 18; Malays,\r\n12; Frizzles, 7; Le Fleche, 7; Dominiques, 5; Booted Bantams, 4;\r\nMalay Bantams, 3; Crevecoeure, 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL AND SCIENTIFIC BREEDING\r\n\r\n\r\nScience has been defined as the \"know how\" and art as the \"do how.\"\r\nThe man who works by art depends upon an unconscious judgment which\r\nis inborn or is acquired by long practice. The man who works by\r\nscience may also have this artistic taste, but he tests its dicta by\r\ncomparison with known facts and principles. The scientist not only\r\nlooks before he leaps, but measures the distance and knows exactly\r\nwhere he is going to land.\r\n\r\nBreeding has for centuries been an art, but the science of breeding\r\nis so new as to seem a mass of contradictions to all except those\r\nfamiliar with the maze of mathematics and biology by which the\r\nbarn-yard facts must find their ultimate explanation. The science of\r\nbreeding may in the future bring about that which would now seem\r\nmiraculous, but it is the ancient art of breeding that is and will\r\nfor years continue to be the means by which the poultry fancier will\r\nachieve his results.\r\n\r\nIn a volume the chief aim of which is to place the poultry industry,\r\nwhich is now conducted as an art, in the realm of technical science,\r\nit might seem proper to devote considerable space to the subject of\r\nbreeding, That I shall not do so, is for the reason that while\r\ntheoretically I recognize the important part that breeding plays in\r\nall animal production, for the practical proposition of producing\r\npoultry products at the lowest possible cost, a knowledge of the\r\ntechnical science of breeding is unessential and may, by diverting\r\nthe poultryman's time to unprofitable efforts, prove an actual\r\nhandicap.\r\n\r\nFor the show room breeder the new science of breeding is too\r\nundeveloped to be of immediate service, or I had better say, the\r\nshow room requisites are too complicated for theoretical breeding to\r\npromise results. For the commercial poultryman, I shall review what\r\nhas been accomplished and state briefly the theories upon which\r\ncontemplated work is based.\r\n\r\nThe objects striven after in poultry breeding are: 1st: To create\r\nnew varieties which shall have improved practical points or shall\r\nattract attention as curiosities. 2d: To approach the ideals\r\naccepted by fanciers for established breeds, and hence win in\r\ncompetition. 3d: To change some particular feature or habit as, to\r\nincrease egg production or reduce the size of bantams. 4th: To\r\nimprove several points at once as, eggs and size in general purpose\r\nfowls. This classification is really unnecessary, as the most\r\nspecialized breeding involves consideration of many points.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreeding as an Art.\r\n\r\nThe method by which breeds and varieties of the show room specimens\r\nhave been developed is essentially as follows: The wonderfully\r\ndifferent varieties of fowl from every quarter of the earth are\r\nbrought together. Crossing is then resorted to, with the result that\r\nbirds of all forms and colors are produced. The breeder then selects\r\nspecimens that most nearly conform to the type or ideal in his mind.\r\n\r\nSuppose a man wished to produce Barred Leghorns, with a fifth toe.\r\nHe would secure Barred Rocks, White Leghorns and White or Gray\r\nDorkings. Then he would cross in every conceivable fashion.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he might have trouble getting the white color to disappear.\r\nIn that case Buff Leghorns which are a newer breed might be tried\r\nand found more pliable material. By such methods the breeder would in\r\nthree or four generations of crossing get a crude type of what he\r\ndesired. Henceforth it would be a matter of patience and\r\nselection. Five to twenty years is the time usually taken to produce\r\nnew breeds of fancy poultry that will breed true to type. In this\r\nstyle of breeding the principles at stake are simple. The first is\r\nto secure the variations wanted; second, to breed from the most\r\ndesirable of these specimens.\r\n\r\nThe same methods of selection that establish a breed are used to\r\nmaintain it, or to establish strains. In ordinary breeding there are\r\ntwo other principles that are sometimes called into play. One is\r\nprepotency, the other is inbreeding. By prepotent we mean having\r\nunusual power to transmit characters to offspring. Suppose a breeder\r\nhas five yards headed by five cock birds. The male in yard two he\r\ndoes not consider quite as fine as the bird in yard one, but in the\r\nfall he finds the offspring of bird from two much better than the\r\noffspring from yard one. The breeder should keep the prepotent sire\r\nand his offspring rather than the more perfect male, who fails to\r\nstamp his traits upon his get.\r\n\r\nNormally a child has two parents, four grandparents, and eight\r\ngreat-grandparents. Now, when cousins marry, the great-grandparents\r\nof the offspring are reduced to six. The mating of brother and\r\nsister cuts the grandparents to two, and the great-grandparents to\r\nfour. Mating of parent and offspring makes a parent and grandparent\r\nidentical and likewise eliminates ancestry. Inbreeding means the\r\nreduction of the number of branches in the ancestral tree, and this\r\nmeans the reduction of the number of chances to get variation, be\r\nthey good or bad.\r\n\r\nInbreeding simply intensifies whatever is there. It does not\r\nnecessarily destroy the vitality, but if close inbreeding is\r\npracticed long enough, sooner or later some little existing weakness\r\nor peculiarity would become intensified and may prove fatal to the\r\nstrain. For illustration, suppose we began inbreeding brother and\r\nsister with a view of keeping it up indefinitely. Now, in the\r\noriginal blood, a tendency for the predominance of one sex over the\r\nother undoubtedly exists and would be intensified until there would\r\ncome a generation all of one sex, which, of course, terminates our\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nInbreeding has always been tabooed by the people generally.\r\nMeanwhile the clever stock breeders have combined inbreeding with\r\nselection and have won the show prizes and sold the people \"new\r\nblood\" at fancy prices.\r\n\r\nUnintelligent inbreeding as practiced on many a farm, results in run\r\ndown stock, not so much from inbreeding as from lack of selection.\r\nOut-crossing or mixing in of new blood is better than hit-or-miss\r\ninbreeding. Intelligent inbreeding is better still.\r\n\r\n\r\nScientific Theories of Breeding.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main tenet of Darwin's theory of racial inheritance or\r\nevolution, was that changes in animal life, wild or domestic, were\r\nbrought about by the addition of very slight, perhaps imperceptible,\r\nvariations. He argued that the giraffe with the longest neck could\r\nbrowse on higher leaves in time of drought and hence left offspring\r\nwith slightly longer necks than the previous generation.\r\n\r\nUpon this theory the ordinary breeding by selection is based. In\r\ncase of breeding for show room, the breeder's eye, or the judge's\r\nscore card, is the tape with which to measure the length of the\r\ngiraffe's neck. This principle can be applied equally well, even\r\nbetter, to characteristics where accurate measurement may be used.\r\n\r\nThe last forty years of scientific progress has established firmly\r\nthe general theories of Darwin, but they have also resulted in our\r\nquestioning his idea that all great changes are due to the sum of\r\nsmall variations. Many instances have been suggested in which the\r\ntheory of gradual changes could not explain the facts.\r\n\r\nThe theory of mutation, of which Hugo de Vries, of Holland, is the\r\nchief expounder, does not antagonize Darwin, but simply gives more\r\nweight in the process of evolution to the factor of sudden changes\r\ncommonly called sports. Let us illustrate: In the giraffe of our\r\nformer forest, one might appear whose neck was not longer because of\r\nslightly longer vertebrae, but who possessed an extra vertebrae.\r\nThis would be a mutation. In other words, a mutation is a marked\r\nvariation that may be inherited. We now believe that polled cattle,\r\nfive-toed Dorkings, top-knotted Houdans, frizzles and black skinned\r\nchickens arose through mutations.\r\n\r\nBurbank's Methods--The wonderful Burbank with his thornless cactus,\r\nhis stoneless plum, and his white blackberry, is simply a searcher\r\nafter mutations. His success is not because he uses any secret\r\nmethods, but because of the size of his operations. He produces his\r\nspecimens by the millions, and in these millions looks, and often\r\nlooks in vain for the lonely sport that is to father a new race.\r\nBurbank has, with plants, many advantages of which the animal\r\nbreeder is deprived. He can produce his specimens in greater number,\r\nhe can more easily find out the desirable character, and in many\r\nplants he has not the uncertain element of double parentage to\r\ncontend with, while with others he is still more fortunate, as he\r\ncan produce them by seed, stimulate variation until the desired\r\nmutation is found and can then reproduce the desired variation with\r\ncertainty by the use of cuttings. This latter is not true\r\ninheritance with its inevitable variation, but the indefinite\r\nprolongation of the life of one individual. In this sense there is\r\nonly one seedless orange tree in the world.\r\n\r\nThe Centgenitor System--Prof. Hays in breeding wheat at Minnesota,\r\nfirst used in this country a system of breeding which is essentially\r\nas follows: A large variety of individual seeds are selected. These\r\nare planted separately and the amount and character of the yield\r\nobserved. The offspring of one seed is kept separate for several\r\ngenerations, or until the character of the tribe is thoroughly\r\nestablished. The advantage of this plan of breeding is in that the\r\nselection is not made by comparing individuals, but by comparing the\r\noffspring of individuals. Thus, we necessarily select the only trait\r\nreally worth while; that is prepotency or the ability to beget\r\ndesirable qualities.\r\n\r\nThe application of this centgenitor system necessitates inbreeding;\r\nit also necessitates large operations. Of the former, breeders have\r\ngenerally been afraid; of the latter they have lacked opportunity.\r\nBut the centgenitor system, combined with Burbank's principle of\r\nlarge opportunity of selection, is, in the writer's belief, the\r\nmethod by which the 200-egg hen will be ultimately established in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nMuch of the recent stimulus to the study of the Science of Breeding\r\nwas occasioned by the discovery of Mendel's Law. Briefly, the law\r\nstates that when two pure traits or characters are crossed, one\r\ndominates in the first generation of offspring--the other remaining\r\nhidden or recessive. Of the second generation, one-half the\r\nindividuals are still mixed, bearing the dominant characteristic\r\nexternally and the other hidden; one-fourth are pure dominants and\r\none-fourth are pure recessives. In future generations the mixed or\r\nhybrid individuals again give birth to mixed and pure types\r\napportioned as before, thus continuing until all offspring become\r\nultimately pure. For illustration: If rose and single comb chickens\r\nare crossed, rose combs are dominant. The first generation will all\r\nhave rose combs. The second generation will have one-fourth single\r\ncombs that will breed true, one-fourth rose combs that will breed\r\nrose combs only, and one-half that again will give all three types.\r\n\r\nMendel's Law works all right in cases where pure unit\r\ncharacteristics are to be found. For the great practical problems in\r\ninheritance, Mendel's law is utterly hopeless. The trouble is that\r\nthe chief things with which we are concerned are not unit\r\ncharacteristics but are combinations of countless characteristics\r\nwhich cannot be seen or known, hence cannot be picked out. Thus the\r\ntendency to revert to pure types is foiled by the constant\r\nrecrossing of these types.\r\n\r\nMendel's law is a scientific curiosity like the aeroplane. It may\r\nsome day be more than a curiosity, but both have tremendous odds to\r\novercome before they supplant our present methods.\r\n\r\nProf. C.B. Davenport, of the Carnegie Institute, is working on\r\nexperimental poultry breeding in its purely scientific sense. His\r\nconclusions have been much criticised by poultry fanciers. The truth\r\nof the matter is that the fancier fails to appreciate the spirit of\r\npure science. The scientist, enthused to find his white fowl\r\nre-occur after a generation of black ones, is wholly undisturbed by\r\nthe fact that the white ones, if exhibited, might be taken for a\r\nSilver Spangled Hamburg.\r\n\r\nMendel's law as yet offers little to the fancier and less to the\r\ncommercial poultryman. Its study is all right in its place, but its\r\nplace is not on the poultry plant whose profits are to buy the baby\r\na new dress.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreeding for Egg Production.\r\n\r\nAttempts to improve the egg-producing qualities of the hen date from\r\nthe domestication of the hen, but it has only been within the last\r\nfew years that rapid progress has been possible in this work. The\r\ninability to determine the good layers has been the difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of people make no selection of hens from which to\r\nhatch their stock. The eggs of the whole flock are kept together and\r\nwhen eggs are desired for hatching they are selected from a general\r\nbasket. It has been assumed, and is shown by trap-nest records, that\r\neggs thus selected in the spring of the year are from the poorer,\r\nrather than from the better layers. This is because hens that have\r\nnot been laying during the winter will lay very heavily during the\r\nspring season. Many breeders have attempted to pick out the good\r\nlayers by the appearance of the hens. Before the advent of the\r\ntrap-nest the \"egg type\" of hen was believed to be a positive\r\nindication of a good layer. The \"egg type\" hen had slender neck,\r\nsmall head, long, deep body of a wedge shape. Various \"systems\"\r\nfounded on these or other \"signs\" have been sold for fancy prices to\r\npeople who were easily separated from their money. Trap-nest records\r\nshow such systems to be on a par with the lunar guidance in\r\nagricultural operations.\r\n\r\nI might remark here that the determination of sex by the shape of\r\nthe egg or similar methods, is in a like category. Science finds no\r\nproof of such theories.\r\n\r\nA few methods of selecting the layers have been suggested which,\r\nwhile far from absolute, are of some significance and are well worth\r\nnoting. The hen that sits upon the roost while other hens are out\r\nforaging, is probably a drone. The excessively fat or the\r\nexcessively lean hens are not likely to be layers. It would\r\nnaturally be supposed that the active laying hen would be the last\r\none to go to roost at night. At the Kansas Experiment Station, the\r\nwriter made observations upon the order in which the hens went to\r\nroost, and the above assumption was found in the majority of cases\r\nto be correct.\r\n\r\nA still better scheme of selecting layers is the practice of picking\r\nout the thrifty, quickly maturing pullets when they first begin to\r\nlay in the fall season. At the Maine Experiment Station, such a\r\nselection gave a flock of layers which averaged about one hundred\r\nand eighty eggs, when the remainder of the flock yielded only one\r\nhundred and forty.\r\n\r\nTrap-nests devised to catch the hen that lays the egg are numerous\r\nin the market. A trap-nest to be successful, must not only catch the\r\nhen that lays, but must prevent the entrance of the other hens.\r\n\r\nThe more trap-nests that are provided, the less often they will\r\nrequire attention, but the more often the nests are attended the\r\nbetter for the comfort of the hens.\r\n\r\nThe use of trap-nests is expensive and cannot be recommended for the\r\npoultryman who must make every hour of time put on his chickens\r\nyield him an immediate income. Fanciers and Experiment Stations can\r\nwell afford to use trap-nests and must, indeed, use them both for\r\nbreeding for egg production, and also for determining the hen that\r\nlaid the egg when full pedigrees are desired in other breeding work.\r\n\r\nA scheme that has sometimes been used in the place of trap-nests, is\r\na system of small compartments, in each of which one hen is kept.\r\nSuch a scheme does not seem feasible on a large scale, but for\r\nbreeders wishing to keep the records of a small number of hens, it\r\nis all right. Because of its cost, this system is wholly out of the\r\nquestion, except for a man following breeding as a hobby and who\r\ncannot devote himself during the day to the care of trap-nests.\r\n\r\nHaving determined the best layers, it remains to breed from these\r\nand from their descendants. The tests of pullets hatched from hens\r\nare better signs of the hen's value as a breeder than is her own\r\nrecord. It has been surmised that a hen which lays heavily will not\r\nlay eggs containing vigorous germs. So far as the writer's\r\nexperience has gone, the laying of infertile eggs is a family or\r\nindividual trait not particularly related to the number of eggs\r\nlaid.\r\n\r\nWhen we have bred from the best layers and have raised our average\r\negg yielder to a higher level, the question arises as to whether the\r\nstrain will permanently maintain the high yield or drop back to the\r\nformer rate of production. Theory says that it will not drop back.\r\nAs a matter of fact it will not do so, for the heavier production\r\nwill be more trying on the hen's constitution, and naturally\r\nselection will gradually cause the egg record to dwindle. Hence the\r\nnecessity of continued selection or the infusion of new blood from\r\nother selected strains.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the change desired in a strain of chickens,\r\nspecimens showing the trait to be selected should be used as\r\nbreeders. Those characteristics readily visible to the eye have long\r\nbeen the subjects of the breeder's efforts. But traits not directly\r\nvisible can likewise be changed by breeding. The number of eggs,\r\nsize and color of eggs, rapid growth, ready fattening powers,\r\nquality of meat and general characteristics, are all matters of\r\ninheritance, and if proper means are taken to select the desirable\r\nindividuals all such characteristics can be changed at the will of\r\nthe breeder.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact, however, often overlooked, that the more traits for\r\nwhich one selects, the slower will be progress. For illustration: If\r\nin breeding for egg production, one-half the good layers are\r\ndiscarded for lack of fancy points, the progress will be just half\r\nas rapid.\r\n\r\nA discussion of the work in breeding for egg production at the Maine\r\nExperiment Station is taken up in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT STATION WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nOur entire scheme of agricultural education and experimentation is\r\nnew. The poultry work at experiment stations is very new. Ten years\r\nwill about cover everything worthy of a permanent record in the\r\npoultry experiment station files.\r\n\r\n\r\nStations Leading in Poultry Work.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest stations to begin poultry work in this country\r\nwere Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Maine. Rhode\r\nIsland conducted the first school of poultry culture. The two\r\nstations of New York State were also early in the work, and Cornell\r\nnow has the leading school of poultry culture in this country.\r\n\r\nWest Virginia has always maintained a considerable poultry plant.\r\nOutside of the states east of the Appalachians, the first poultry\r\nwork to be heard of was that of Prof. Dryden at the Experiment\r\nStation of Utah. Prof. Dryden's work was of a demonstrative nature.\r\nHis early bulletins were forceful and well illustrated, and did much\r\nto call attention to poultry work.\r\n\r\nIn all this early work the great Mississippi Valley, where\r\nfour-fifths of the nation's poultry is produced, entirely ignored\r\nthe hen. The writer began his work with poultry at the Kansas\r\nStation in 1902, but his chickens were housed in a discarded hog\r\nhouse, and no funds being available, little was accomplished. In the\r\nlast three or four years these experiment stations are rapidly\r\nfalling into line and a number of poultry bulletins have recently\r\nbeen issued from these younger schools.\r\n\r\nA few of the early landmarks in experiment station work was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe Utah Station clearly found that hens laid about 65 per cent. as\r\nmany eggs in the second as in the first year, and that to keep hens\r\nfor egg production beyond the second year, was unprofitable.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts proved that corn was a better food for layers than\r\nwheat, and that the prejudice against it was founded on a misapplied\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nThe New York Station at Geneva demonstrated that poultry generally,\r\nand ducks in particular, are not vegetarians, and must have meat to\r\nthrive and that vegetable protein will not make good the deficiency.\r\n\r\nThe Maine Station was chiefly instrumental in introducing\r\ntrap-nests, curtain front houses and dry feeding. The breeding work\r\nat Maine will be discussed at length in the last section of this\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nThe United States Department of Agriculture did not take up poultry\r\nwork until 1906. The publications issued by the department before\r\nthat time were written by outsiders and printed by the Government.\r\n\r\nThe following is the list of the addresses of the experiment\r\nstations who have taken a leading interest in poultry work. It is\r\nnot worth while giving a list of poultry bulletins, as many of them\r\nare out of print and can only be consulted in a library.\r\n\r\n    Maine--Orono.\r\n    Mass.--Amherst.\r\n    Conn.--Storrs.\r\n    Rhode Is.--Kingston.\r\n    New York--Ithaca.\r\n    New York--Geneva.\r\n    Maryland--College Park.\r\n    West. Va.--Morgantown.\r\n    Iowa--Ames.\r\n    Kansas--Manhattan.\r\n    Utah--Logan.\r\n    Calif.--Berkeley.\r\n    Oregon--Corvalis.\r\n    U.S. Gov.--Washington, D.C.\r\n    Ontario--Guelph (Canada).\r\n\r\nMany foreign governments have us out-distanced in the encouragement\r\nof the poultry industry. Our Canadian neighbors have done much more\r\npractical work in getting out among the farmers and improving the\r\nstock and methods along commercial lines. As a result the Canadians\r\nhave built up a nice British trade with which we have thus far not\r\nbeen able to compete. The work by the Ontario Station on the subject\r\nof incubation is discussed in the Chapter on Incubation.\r\n\r\nAustralia, like Canada, has given much practical assistance in\r\nmarketing the poultry products, the government maintaining packing\r\nstations, where the poultry is packed for export. The Australian\r\nlaying contests are quoted in the present volume. They outclass\r\nanything else in the world along that line.\r\n\r\nIn England, Ireland and especially in Denmark, the government, or\r\nsocieties encouraged by the Government, have done a great deal to\r\ndevelop the poultry industry. Depots for marketing and grading are\r\nmaintained and the stock of the farmers is improved by fowls from\r\nthe government breeding farms.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story of the \"Big Coon.\"\r\n\r\nWith apologies to Joel Chandler Harris, I will tell a little story.\r\n\r\nUncle Remus was telling the little boy about the \"big coon.\" It\r\nseems that the \"big coon\" had been seen on numerous occasions, but\r\nall efforts at his capture had failed. One night they saw the \"big\r\ncoon\" up in the 'simmon tree, in the middle of the ten-acre lot. All\r\nhands and the dogs were summoned. To be sure of bagging the game,\r\nthe tree was cut down. The dogs rushed in but there was no coon.\r\n\r\n\"But, Uncle Remus,\" said the little boy, \"I thought you said you saw\r\nthe big coon in the tree.\"\r\n\r\n\"Laws, chile,\" replied Uncle Remus, \"doesn't youse know dat it am\r\nmighty easy for folks to see something dat ain't dar, when dey are\r\nlookin' fer it?\"\r\n\r\nWhen scientific experimenters entered the poultry field about\r\nfifteen years ago, they found it swarming with old ladies' notions.\r\nFor everything a reason was given, but these reasons were derived\r\nfrom the kind of dreams where that which pleases the human mind is\r\nseized upon and search is made to find ideas to back it, not because\r\nit is true, but because it \"listens good\" to the dreamer. The first\r\nduty of the scientist was to banish these will-o'-the-wisp ideas\r\nthat lead to no practical results.\r\n\r\nFor illustration Round eggs were supposed to hatch pullets and long\r\nones cockerels. Eggs will not hatch if it thunders. Shipped eggs\r\nmust be allowed to rest before hatching, the drug store was the\r\nuniversal source of relief when the chickens became sick, and red\r\npepper and patent foods were the egg foods par excellence. These\r\nthings, thanks to the scientist, are no longer believed or regarded\r\nby well read poultrymen, and instead his attention has been turned\r\nto matters having a more happy relation to his bank account.\r\n\r\nIn clearing away the useless popular notions, the scientists\r\nthemselves have not been free from their influence, especially when\r\nthey seemed to agree with accepted scientific theory. Many, indeed,\r\nare the 'coons in poultry science that have been seen because they\r\nwere being looked for.\r\n\r\nAs a partial explanation it should be said that men available for\r\nscientific poultry work are very scarce. Poultry keepers schooled in\r\nthe University of the Poultry Yard have no conception of scientific\r\nmethods, and would explain experimental results by a theory that\r\nwould fail to fit elsewhere. The available scientists on the other\r\nhand are seldom poultrymen.\r\n\r\nAmong the first men to take up animal husbandry work of all kinds,\r\nwere the veterinarians. For years the only poultry publications put\r\nout by the U.S. Government were by veterinarians. These dust covered\r\nvolumes with their five color plates of the fifty-seven varieties of\r\ntapeworms, still rest on the shelves of public libraries, a monument\r\nto the time when the practical poultryman knew only things that\r\nweren't so, and the scientific poultryman knew only things that were\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nThe first general law that all experimenters should know and the\r\nignorance of which has caused and still causes the waste of the\r\nmajor portion of experimental brains and money, we will call the\r\n\"Law of Chance.\" Let the reader who is not familiar with such things\r\ntake two pennies and toss them upon the table. They are both heads\r\nup. He tosses them again, one comes heads, the other tails. The\r\nthird time repeats the second. The fourth both come tails. The law\r\nof chance says this is correct. Heads should appear 25 per cent.,\r\ntails 25 per cent., and mixed 50 per cent. of the time. Now let the\r\nreader try this in a lot of twelve tosses. Does it prove the law?\r\nTry it again. Are all lots alike? Now pitch a hundred times, then\r\npitch pennies all day. By night the law will be so near proven that\r\nthe experimenter will be willing to concede its validity.\r\n\r\nNow suppose the lots of twelve tosses, each were lots of twelve\r\nhens, one Plymouth Rocks, the other Wyandottes, or one fed corn and\r\nthe other wheat. The law of chance clearly proves that the larger\r\nnumber of unites, the nearer the theoretical truths will be the\r\nexperimental results. Note, however, that small lots may by chance\r\nbe as near the truth as large lots.\r\n\r\nIn practice two grave errors are made: First, conclusions are drawn\r\nfrom small lots compared with each other; second, conclusions are\r\ndrawn from large lots compared with small lots. In the first case\r\nboth may be off; in the latter case the small one may be off.\r\nExamples of the first error are to be found in the scores of\r\ncontradicting breed and feed tests, that were published in the early\r\ndays of poultry research. The second error is exemplified in the\r\nOntario experiments in incubation, to which reference has already\r\nbeen made.\r\n\r\nHere is a further example of this error. From the fifth egg laying\r\ncompetition at the Hawkesbury Agricultural College in Australia, I\r\ncopy the following:\r\n\r\n    No. of Hens.      Variety.             Ave. Egg Yield.\r\n\r\n      6               Cuckoo Leghorn               190.16\r\n     30               S.C. Brown Leghorn           177.00\r\n    138               S.C. White Leghorn           174.93\r\n     12               R.C. Brown Leghorn           173.50\r\n     12               R.C. White Leghorn           172.66\r\n     18               Buff Leghorn                 160.55\r\n      6               Black Leghorn                138.33\r\n\r\nThe ranking of Cuckoo Leghorns as first is a chance happening due to\r\nthe small number; likewise the Black Leghorns had a streak of bad\r\nluck and received lowest place. To one not familiar with such work,\r\nthe real significance of the table is that the S.C.W. Leghorns did\r\nthe best work. A totaling of all other varieties gives 84 fowls with\r\nan average egg production of 170.5, which bears out the conclusion.\r\nAs these birds were all kept in pens of six, we would expect to find\r\nthe highest single pen to be White Leghorns, because, when compared\r\nwith all other Leghorns, they have both the highest average and the\r\ngreatest number. This accords with the fact that as the highest\r\nsingle pen is found to be White Leghorns with an egg yield of 239\r\neggs.\r\n\r\nThe above illustrates another important phase of the laws of chance,\r\nwhich says that not only is the average likely to be nearer the\r\ntheoretical average sought when the number is increased, but that\r\nthe individual extremes will be more removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Experimental Results at the Illinois Station.\r\n\r\nFrom an Illinois Experiment Station report, the following is quoted:\r\n\r\n\"The stock used was Barred Plymouth Rock pullets. These pullets were\r\na very uniform Barred Rock stock that had been bred as an individual\r\nstrain for many years. They were practically the same age, and\r\nexcept for the factors mentioned were treated as uniformly as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n    First Year's Results.\r\n\r\n    No. Hens.      Diet.

The difference indicated in the first year's results was so\r\nlight that it was decided to repeat the experiment the second year.\r\n\r\n\"As the wet wash is clearly proven to be superior, these hens were\r\nused the second year to compare meat meal with fresh cut bone.\r\n\r\n    Second Year's Result.\r\n\r\n    No. Hens.      Diet.

The comparison of a highly nitrogenous ration with that\r\nof a ration consisting largely of corn, while showing the advantages\r\nof the nitrogenous rations, does not show the contrast expected.\r\n\r\n\"Some visiting poultrymen expressed the opinion that corn is a\r\nbetter poultry food than commonly supposed. Considering this fact\r\nand the great fundamental importance of the question at issue, it\r\nwas decided to repeat the experiment a third year, and feed a large\r\nnumber of birds on each ration.\r\n\r\n    No. Hens.

The Illinois Experiment Station has never owned a chicken.\r\nThese \"Illinois\" experiments were planned and executed in a few\r\nminutes of the writer's spare time. The basis of the experiments was\r\na pack of cards containing the individual records of the Maine\r\nExperiment Station hens, shuffling the cards and averaging the\r\ndesired number of records as they come in the pack, made the\r\ndistinction between the various diets.\r\n\r\n\r\nExperimental Bias.\r\n\r\nPet ideas consciously or unconsciously mold practice. A bias toward\r\nan idea may show itself in the planning and conducting of an\r\nexperiment, or it may come out in the later interpretation.\r\n\r\nAn illustration of the first kind is found in the early work of the\r\nWest Virginia Station (Bulletin 60). With the preconceived notion\r\nthat hens should have a nitrogenous diet an experiment was planned\r\nand conducted as follows:\r\n\r\nOne lot of hens was fed corn, potatoes, oats and corn meal. A\r\ncontrasted lot reveled in corn, potatoes, hominy feed, oat meal,\r\ncorn meal and fresh cut bone. The results were in favor of the\r\nlatter ration by a doubled egg yield.\r\n\r\nTo any experienced poultryman the reason is evident. The variety of\r\nthe diet and the meat food are what made the showing.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the Massachusetts Station planned a similar\r\nexperiment. The bias was the same, but it took a fairer form. The\r\nhens were both given a decent variety of food and some form of meat.\r\nThe bulk of the grain was corn in the carbonaceous, and wheat in the\r\nnitrogenous ration. The results were in favor of the corn. This\r\nastonished the experimenter. He tried it again and again tests came\r\nout in favor of corn. At last the old theory was revoked, and the\r\nfallacy of wheat being essential to egg production was exploded. If\r\nby an irony of fate in the shuffling of the hens, the wheat pen had\r\nthe first time showed an advantage, the experimenter might have been\r\nsatisfied and the waste of feeding high priced feed when a better\r\nand a cheaper is at hand, might have gone on indefinitely.\r\n\r\nOf bias in the interpretation of results all publications are more\r\nor less saturated. A reading of the Chapter on Incubation will\r\nillustrate this. A common error of this kind is the omission of\r\nfacts necessary to fully explain results. Items of costs are\r\ninvariably omitted or minimized. Food cost alone is usually\r\nmentioned in figuring experimenting station poultry profits, which\r\nstatement will undoubtedly cause a sad smile to creep over the face\r\nof many a \"has-been\" poultryman.\r\n\r\nThe writer remembers an incident from his college days which\r\nillustrates the point in hand. Let it first be remarked that this\r\nwas on the new lands of the trans-Missouri Country, where manure had\r\nno more commercial value than soil, and is freely given to those\r\nwho will haul it away.\r\n\r\nThe professor at the blackboard had been figuring up handsome\r\nprofits on a type of dairying towards which he wits very partial.\r\nThe figures showed a goodly profit, but the biggest expense\r\nitem--that of labor--was omitted. One of the students held up his\r\nhand and inquired after the labor bill.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said the smiling professor, \"The manure will pay for the\r\nlabor.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the class adjourned, the student remarked: \"They say figures\r\nwon't lie, but a liar will figure.\"\r\n\r\nThe third way in which experiments are made worthless is by the\r\nintroduction of factors other than the one being tested. This may be\r\ndone by chance, and the conductor not realize the presence of the\r\nother factor, or the varying factors may be introduced intentionally\r\nunder the belief that they are negligible. Of the first case an\r\ninstance may be cited of the placing of two flocks in a house, one\r\nend of which is damper than the other, the accidental introduction\r\ninto one flock of a contagious disease, or one flock being thrown\r\noff feed by an excessive feed of greens, etc., etc. These factors\r\nthat influence pens of birds greatly add to the error of the law of\r\nchance. In fact it amounts to the same thing on a larger scale. For\r\nthis reason not only are many individuals, but many flocks, many\r\nlocations, and many years needed to prove the superiority of the\r\ncontrasted methods.\r\n\r\nThe criticisms in the following section will amply illustrate the\r\ncase of foreign factors being unwisely introduced into an\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Egg Breeding Work at the Maine Station.\r\n\r\nAs is well known the Maine Station was for years considered by all\r\npoultrymen to be doing a great and beneficial work in breeding for\r\nincreased egg production. Up until the fall of 1907, the poultrymen\r\nof the country were of the opinion that this work was in every way\r\nsuccessful, and a large number of private breeders had taken up the\r\nuse of trap-nests in an effort to build up the egg production of\r\ntheir fowls.\r\n\r\nWhen early in 1908 Bulletin 157 of the Maine Experiment Station was\r\npublished, it showed by averages as given in the table on page 202\r\nthat the egg yield at the station was for the entire period on the\r\ndecline. In Bulletin 157, the statement was made that \"arithmetical\r\nmistakes\" and \"faulty statistical methods\" accounted for the\r\ndiscrepancies between the former publications and the criticised\r\ndata. The further explanation that \"the experiment was a success as\r\nan experiment,\" etc., only appeared to the public mind as a graceful\r\nway of explaining what was, to the practical man, an utter failure\r\nof the entire work.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate death of Professor Gowell, together with the fact\r\nthat he had equipped a private poultry farm with station stock,\r\nadded to the confusion, and the result of the bulletin was the\r\nprecipitation of a general \"pow-wow\" in which the poultry editors\r\nwere about equally divided between those who were casting\r\ninsinuations upon the personnel of the station, and those who\r\ndecried the whole effort toward improving the egg yield.\r\n\r\nAfter going over the publications of Professor Gowell, visiting the\r\nstation and meeting the present force, I came to the following\r\nconclusions regarding the matter:\r\n\r\nProfessor Gowell's work is open to severe criticism. Errors have\r\nbeen made in conducting the work at Maine which have made it\r\npossible for a mathematical biologist to take the data and seemingly\r\nprove that selection, as practiced by Professor Gowell, actually\r\nresulted in lowering inherent egg capacity of the strain of Plymouth\r\nRock hens under experimentation. Had Professor Gowell's successor\r\nbeen a practical poultryman, it is my candid opinion that the public\r\nwould have been given a radically different explanation of the\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nProfessor Gowell is the author of the following statement: \"The\r\nsmall chicken grower is earnestly urged to use an incubator for\r\nhatching.\" This opinion is not in accord with that of the majority\r\nof breeders and the more progressive experiment station workers. The\r\nopinion has been expressed by Professor Graham and others, that the\r\nparticular results at the Maine Station may have been due to the\r\ndecrease of vitality caused by continued artificial hatching. This\r\nview may be wholly without foundation. Nevertheless, as the common\r\ntype of incubator is under heavy criticism, and it is pretty well\r\nproven that chicks so hatched have not the vitality of naturally\r\nhatched chicks, surely a series of breeding experiments would carry\r\nmore weight if the replenishing of the flock had been accomplished\r\nby natural means.\r\n\r\nFor the first few years of the breeding work the house used was the\r\nold-fashioned double walled and warmed pattern. The last few years\r\nof this work were conducted in curtain front houses. That the cool\r\nhouse is an improvement over the warm house is generally conceded,\r\nbut there are many poultrymen who are still of the opinion that the\r\nwarm house will give a larger egg yield, though at a greater expense\r\nand less profit.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of the work the method of feeding was also a\r\ntime-honored one, and included a warm mash. About the middle of the\r\nexperimental period Professor Gowell brought out the system of\r\nfeeding dry mash from hoppers. This custom became a great fad and\r\nProfessor Gowell and Director Woods have preached it far and wide.\r\nPerhaps it is an improvement, but it is to-day much more popular\r\nwith novices than with established egg farms. Many old line\r\npoultrymen have tried dry mash only to go back to wet mash, by which\r\nmethod the hens can be induced to eat more which is conducive to\r\nhigh egg yields. Whether these changes in housing and feeding have\r\nbeen improvements as claimed by those who introduced them, or\r\nwhether their popularity may be explained in part at least by the\r\npsychology of fads, is a point in question, but certainly the\r\nmarring of a breeding experiment by introducing radical changes in\r\nthe factors of production is at best unfortunate.\r\n\r\nA much more serious criticism than any of the foregoing is to be\r\nfound in a change of the size of flocks and amount of floor space\r\nper fowl. I have gone over carefully the published records of\r\nProfessor Gowell, and the review of Dr. Pearl, and the following\r\ntable represents, as near as I can determine, these factors for the\r\nseries of years. In the year 1903 I find no clear statement as to\r\nthe manner in which the birds were housed, and I may be in error in\r\nthis case. Otherwise the table gives the facts.\r\n\r\n     Year  Hens in Flock  Per Hen      Egg Yield\r\n     1900  20             8. sq. ft.   136.36\r\n     1901  20             8. sq. ft.   143.44\r\n     1902  20             8. sq. ft.   155.58\r\n     1903  20             8. sq. ft.   135.42\r\n     1904  50             4.4 sq. ft.  117.90\r\n     1905  50             4.4 sq. ft.  134.07\r\n     1906  50             4.4 sq. ft.  140.14\r\n     1907  50             4.4 sq. ft.  113.24\r\n\r\nCertainly this oversight is a serious one, and one especially\r\nremarkable considering the fact that the comparison of different\r\nsize flocks formed a prominent part of the Maine Station work during\r\nthe last three years of the breeding test. The results of the work\r\nat the Maine Station on testing flock size, conducted without\r\nrelation to the breeding work, gave the following results:\r\n\r\n    No. of Hens     Sq. ft. per Hen    Egg Yield\r\n    150                  3.2            111.68\r\n    100                  4.8            123.21\r\n     50                  4.8            129.69\r\n\r\nNo comparisons of 50 and 20 bird flocks in the same year are\r\navailable, but by extending the comparisons of the 50, 100 and 150\r\nflocks into the 20 flock size, we can get some idea of the error\r\nthat has been here introduced. The result of the Australian egg\r\nlaying contest in which the flocks were composed of six hens, shows\r\na yield of about one and one-half times as heavy as the Maine\r\nrecords, which certainly seems to substantiate the ideas here\r\nbrought out.\r\n\r\nIt is a well established fact in poultry circles that many men who\r\nsucceed with a few hundred hens, fail when the number is increased\r\nto as many thousands. When the breeding experiments under discussion\r\nwere started, Professor Gowell had under his supervision about three\r\nhundred hens. When the work was closed the experiment station plant\r\nhad been increased to four or five times its capacity, and Professor\r\nGowell had a large private poultry plant of his own in addition.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note in this connection that the last four\r\nyears of the records are explained by Professor Gowell as being low,\r\ndue to various \"accidents\" (?) It is unreasonable to suppose the\r\ntrue explanation of these \"accidents\" would be found in connection\r\nwith the increased responsibility and size of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe breeding stock sent out by Professor Gowell has given general\r\nsatisfaction, and was found by Professor Graham of the Ontario\r\nStation, as well as by a number of private individuals, to be of\r\nsuperior laying quality to that of the average Barred Rock.\r\n\r\nClearly there is only one way to prove whether Professor Gowell's\r\nwork has been a wasted effort, and that is for flocks of his strain\r\nto be tested at other experiment stations against birds of\r\nmiscellaneous origin.\r\n\r\nThat much has been lost to the poultrymen of the country by the\r\nrecent upheaval at the Maine Station, I believe to be the case, but\r\nthat does not mean that the men now in charge will not in the future\r\nbe of great value to the poultry interests. They are, however, in\r\nthe class of pure scientists rather than applied scientists, but if\r\nlet alone they will dig out something sooner or later which they or\r\nothers can apply to the benefit of the industry.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, I think that the present case of the trap-nest\r\nmethod of increasing egg production stands very much as it is has\r\nalways stood, being a commendable thing for small breeders who could\r\nafford the time, but not practical in a large way, except at\r\nexperiment stations. On a large commercial scale the system of\r\nselecting sires by the collective work of his first year's offspring\r\nwould probably get the quickest results.\r\n\r\nThe best use of the funds of the people in the promotion of\r\nagricultural industries is in the permanent endorsement on the one\r\nhand of a few high grade research stations where the deeper theories\r\nmay be worked out, and on the other the teaching of such good\r\nprinciples and practices as are already known.\r\n\r\nThe greatest opportunity for Government effort lies in the\r\ndevelopment demonstration farm work in poultry Just as it is doing\r\nwith the corn and cotton in the South.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nPOULTRY ON THE GENERAL FARM\r\n\r\n\r\nThis chapter will be devoted to specific directions for the\r\nprofitable keeping of chickens on the typical American farm. By\r\ntypical American farm I mean the farm west of Ohio, north of\r\nTennessee and east of Colorado. Farms outside this section present\r\ndifferent problems. In the region mentioned about three-quarters of\r\nthe American poultry and egg crop is produced, and in this section\r\npoultry keeping is more profitable when conducted as a part of\r\ngeneral farm operations than as an exclusive business.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why a farmer should not be a poultry fancier if\r\nhe desires, but in that case his special interest in his chickens\r\nwould throw him out of the class we are at present considering.\r\nLikewise, I do not doubt that in many instances where the farmer or\r\nmembers of his family took special interest in poultry work, it\r\nwould be profitable to increase the size of operations beyond those\r\nherein advised, using incubators and keeping Leghorns. Of these\r\nexceptions the farmer himself must judge. The rules I lay down are\r\nfor those farmers who wish to keep chickens for profit, but do not\r\ncare to devote any larger share of their time and study to them than\r\nthey do to the cows, hogs, orchard or garden.\r\n\r\nThe advice herein given in this chapter will differ from much of the\r\nadvice given to farmers by poultry writers. The average poultry\r\neditor is afraid to give specific advice concerning breeds,\r\nincubators, etc., because he fears to offend his advertisers. The\r\nreader, left to judge for himself, is liable to pick out some fancy\r\nimpractical variety or method.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest Breeds for the Farm.\r\n\r\nKeep only one variety of chickens. Do not bother with other\r\nvarieties of poultry unless it is turkeys. Whether it will pay to\r\nraise turkeys will depend upon your success with the little turks,\r\nand on the freedom of the community from the disease called\r\nBlack-head.\r\n\r\nThe kind of chicken you should keep should be picked from the three\r\nfollowing breeds: Barred Plymouth Rock, White Wyandotte, Rhode\r\nIsland Reds. If you go outside of these three breeds be sure you\r\nhave a very good reason for doing so.\r\n\r\nThen get a start with a new breed, buy at least four sittings of\r\neggs in a single season, paying not over $2.00 per sitting. Keep all\r\nthe pullets and a half dozen of the best cockerels. The next spring\r\npen these pullets up with the best cockerels, and use none but eggs\r\nfrom this pen for hatching. That fall sell all of the young\r\ncockerels and all the old scrub hens. The second spring the two old\r\nroosters from the original purchased eggs are used with the general\r\nflock. From this time on the entire flock is pure bred and should\r\nremain so.\r\n\r\nEach year when the chicks are about six or eight weeks old pick out\r\nthe largest, most vigorous male chick from each brood. Mark these by\r\nclipping the web of the foot or putting on leg bands. From those so\r\nmarked the breeding cockerels for the next season are later\r\nselected. When you pick the good cockerels pick out all runty\r\nlooking pullets and cut off the last joint of the hind toe. These\r\nrunts are later to be eaten or sold. The more surplus chicks raised,\r\nthe more strictly can the selection be made.\r\n\r\nThis system of picking the best cockerel from each brood and\r\ndiscarding the poorest pullets is the most practical method known of\r\nbuilding up a vigorous, quick growing and early laying strain.\r\n\r\nWhen we allow the entire flock of many different ages to grow up\r\nbefore the selection is made it is impossible to select\r\nintelligently.\r\n\r\nEvery third or fourth year an extra cock bird may be purchased\r\nprovided you are sure you are getting a specimen from a better flock\r\nthan your own. Swapping roosters or eggs every year is poor policy.\r\nIf your neighbor has better stock than you, get his blood pure and\r\nsell off your own, but do not keep a barnyard full of scrubs who can\r\ntrace their ancestry to every flock in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep Only Workers.\r\n\r\nOn many farms few eggs are gathered from October to January. This is\r\na season when eggs bring the best prices. To secure eggs at this\r\nseason, the first requisite is that the pullets be hatched between\r\nthe first of March and the middle of May, or, in the case of\r\nLeghorns, between the first of April and the first of June. Pullets\r\nhatched later than these dates are a source of expense during the\r\nfall and early winter. On the other hand, it is an unnecessary waste\r\nof effort to hatch pullets before the dates mentioned, because, if\r\nhatched too early, they will molt in the fall and stop laying the\r\nsame as old hens.\r\n\r\nPullets must be well fed and cared for if expected to develop in the\r\ntime allowed. As they begin to show signs of maturity they should be\r\ngotten into permanent quarters. If allowed to begin laying while\r\nroosting in coops or in trees they will be liable to quit when\r\nchanged to new quarters. If possible the coops should be gradually\r\nmoved toward the hen-house and the pullets gotten into quarters\r\nwithout excitement or confinement. The poultry-house should have an\r\nample circulation of fresh air. Young stock that have been roosting\r\nin open coops are liable to catch cold if confined in tight houses.\r\n\r\nA common mistake is to allow a large troop of young roosters to\r\noverrun the premises in the early fall. Not only is money lost in\r\nthe decrease in price that can be obtained for these cockerels, but\r\nthe pullets are greatly annoyed, to the detriment of the egg yield.\r\n\r\nAny chicken that is not paying for its food in growth or in egg\r\nproduction is a source of loss. As soon as the hatching season is\r\nover old roosters should be sent to market. Through June and August\r\negg production is not very profitable, and a thorough culling of the\r\nhens should be made. Market all hens two years or more of age. Send\r\nwith these all the yearling hens that appear fat and lazy. By the\r\ntime the young pullets are ready to be moved into quarters--the\r\nlatter part of August--these hens should be reduced to about\r\none-half the original number. Some time during September a final\r\nculling of the old stock should be made. Those that have not yet\r\nbegun to molt should be sold, as they will not be laying again\r\nbefore the warm days of the following February. This system of\r\nculling will leave the best portion of the yearling hens, which,\r\ntogether with the early-hatched pullets, will make a profitable\r\nflock of layers.\r\n\r\n\r\nHatching Chicks With Hens.\r\n\r\nThe eggs for hatching should be stored in a cool, dry location at a\r\ntemperature between forty and seventy degrees Fahrenheit. A good\r\nrule is not to set eggs over two weeks old.\r\n\r\nThe two chief losses with sitting-hens are due to lice and\r\ninterference of other hens. The practice of setting hens in the\r\nchicken-house makes both these difficulties more troublesome. Almost\r\nall farms will have some outbuilding situated apart from the regular\r\nchicken-house that can be used for sitting-hens. The most convenient\r\narrangement will be to use boxes, and have these open at the top.\r\nThey may be placed in rows and a plank somewhat narrower than the\r\nboxes used as a cover. The nests should be made by throwing a shovel\r\nof earth into the box and then shaping a nest of clean straw. Make\r\nthe nest roomy enough so that as the hen steps into the nest the\r\neggs will spread apart readily and not be broken. When a hen shows\r\nsigns of broodiness remove her to the sitting-room. This should be\r\ndone in the evening, so that the hen becomes accustomed to her\r\nposition by daylight. Place the hen upon the nest-eggs and confine\r\nher to the nest. If all is well the next evening give her a full\r\nsetting of eggs.\r\n\r\nA practical method to arrange for sitting-hens is to build the nests\r\nout of doors, allowing each hen a little yard, so that she may have\r\nliberty to leave her nest as she chooses. These nests may be built\r\nby using twelve-inch boards set on edge, so as to form a series of\r\nsmall runways about one by six feet. In one end are built the nests,\r\nwhich are covered by a broad board, while the remainder of the\r\narrangement is covered with lath or netting. The food, grit and\r\nwater should be placed at the opposite end of the runway. Care\r\nshould be taken to locate these nests on well-drained ground.\r\nArrangements should be made to close the front of the nest during\r\nhatching so that the chicks will not drop out. A contrivance of this\r\nkind furnishes a very convenient method of handling sitting-hens,\r\nand if no separate building is available would be the best method to\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncubators on the Farm.\r\n\r\nMy candid advice to the farmer who is in doubt as whether to buy\r\nan incubator or not, is to let it alone. If the farmer reads the\r\nchapter on artificial incubation, he will see that he is dealing\r\nwith a very complex problem, and one in which his chances of success\r\nare not very great.\r\n\r\nIn order to learn the facts concerning incubators on the farms the\r\nwriter made a special investigation on the subject while poultryman\r\nat the Kansas Experiment Station. Replies received from 111 Kansas\r\nfarmers, report 21 as having tried incubators. Of these, 6 reported\r\nthe incubators as being an improvement over hatching with hens; 10\r\nreported the incubator as being successful, but not better than\r\nhens, while the remaining 5 declared the incubator to be a failure.\r\nThe results of this inquiry, and of personal visits to farms, led\r\nthe writer to believe that about one-tenth of the farmers of Kansas\r\nhad tried incubators, and that about as many failed as succeeded\r\nwith artificial hatching.\r\n\r\nThe argument for the incubator on the farm is certainly not one of\r\nbetter hatching, but there is an argument, and a good one for the\r\nfarm incubator. The argument is this: Hens will not set early enough\r\nand in sufficient quantities to get out as large a number of chicks\r\nas the farmer may desire. Now, each hen will not hatch over 10\r\nchicks, but is capable of caring for at least 30. Here the incubator\r\ncomes into good use, for the farmer can set a half dozen hens along\r\nwith the incubator, and give all the chicks to the hens. This is the\r\nmethod I recommend where an incubator is to be used. The development\r\nof the public hatchery would supply these other 20 chicks more\r\neconomically and more certainly than the farm incubator, but until\r\nthat institution becomes established the more ambitious farm poultry\r\nraisers are justified in trying an incubator.\r\n\r\nThe best known incubators in the market are the Cyphers, the Model\r\nand the Prairie State. Cheaper machines are liable to do poor work.\r\nThe following points may help the farmer in deciding whether or not\r\nto buy an incubator and in picking out a good machine.\r\n\r\nThe person to run the incubator is the first condition of its\r\nsuccess. A good incubator requires attention twice a day. One person\r\nshould give this attention, and must give it regularly and\r\ncarefully. The farmer's wife or some younger member of the family\r\ncan often give more time and interest to this work than can the\r\nfarmer. The likelihood of a person's success with artificial\r\nhatchers can best be determined by himself.\r\n\r\nThe best location for an incubator is a moderately damp cellar. The\r\nnext choice would be a room in the house away from the fire or from\r\nwindows. Drafts of air blowing on the machine are especially to be\r\navoided. Not only do they affect the temperature directly, but cause\r\nthe lamp to burn irregularly, and this may result in fire.\r\n\r\nThe objects in view in building an incubator are: (1) To keep the\r\neggs at a proper temperature (103 degrees on a level with the top of\r\nthe eggs). (2) To cause the evaporation of moisture from the eggs at\r\na normal rate. (3) To prevent the eggs from resting too long in one\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThe case of the incubator should be built double, or triple-walled,\r\nto withstand variation in the outside temperature. The doors should\r\nfit neatly and be made of double glass. The lamp should be made of\r\nthe best material, and the wick of sufficient width that the\r\ntemperature may be maintained with a low blaze. The most\r\nsatisfactory place for the lamp is at the end of the machine,\r\noutside the case.\r\n\r\nRegulators composed of two metals, such as aluminum and steel, are\r\nbest. Wafers filled with ether or similar liquid are more sensitive\r\nbut weaker in action. Hard-rubber bars are frequently used.\r\n\r\nThe most practical system of controlling evaporation is a system of\r\nforced ventilation, in which the air is heated around the lamp-flue\r\nand passes through the egg-chamber at a rate determined by\r\nventilators in the bottom of the machine. With the outside air cold\r\nand dry only slight current is required, but as the outer air\r\nbecomes warmer or damper more circulation is needed.\r\n\r\nTurning the egg is not the work that many imagine it to be. It is\r\nnot necessary that the egg be turned with absolute precision and\r\nregularity. An elaborate device for this work is useless. The trays\r\nwill need frequently to be removed and turned around or shifted, and\r\nthe eggs can be turned at this time by lifting out a few on one side\r\nof the tray and rolling the others over.\r\n\r\nTwo other points to be considered in the incubator are: A suitable\r\nnursery or place for the newly hatched chick, and a good\r\nthermometer.\r\n\r\n\r\nRearing Chicks.\r\n\r\nIf it is very early in the spring, and the ground is damp, it is\r\nbest to put the hen and her brood in some building. During the most\r\nof the season the best thing is an outdoor coop. The first\r\nconsideration in making a chicken-coop is to see that it is\r\nrain-proof and rat-tight. The next thing to look for is that the\r\ncoop is not air-tight. Let the front be of rat-tight netting or\r\nheavy screen. The same general plan may be used for small coops for\r\nhens, or for larger coops to be used as colony-houses for growing\r\nchickens. The essentials are: A movable floor raided on cleats, a\r\nsliding front covered with rat-tight netting, and a hood over the\r\nfront to keep the rain from beating in. If used late in the fall or\r\nearly in the spring a piece of cloth should be tacked on the sliding\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nThe chicken-coops should not be bunched up, but scattered out over\r\nas much ground as is convenient. Neither should they remain long in\r\none spot, but should be shifted a few feet each day. At first water\r\nshould be provided at each coop, but as the chickens grow older they\r\nmay be required to come to a few central water pans.\r\n\r\nAs before suggested, rearing chicks with hens is the only suitable\r\nmethod for general farm practice. The brooder on the farm is an\r\nexpensive nuisance.\r\n\r\nFor brooder raised chicks it is necessary to provide means for the\r\nlittle chick to exercise. But in the season when the great majority\r\nof farm chicks are raised they may be placed out of doors from the\r\nstart and the trouble will now be to keep them from getting too much\r\nexercise, i.e.: to keep the hens from chasing around with them\r\nespecially in the wet grass. This is properly prevented by keeping\r\nthe brood coops in plowed ground, and keeping the hens confined by a\r\nslatted door, until the chicks are strong enough to follow her\r\nreadily.\r\n\r\nThe chick should not be fed until 48 to 72 hours old. It may then be\r\nstarted on the same kind of food as is to form its diet in after\r\nlife. The hard boiled egg and bread and milk diets are wholly\r\nunnecessary and are only a waste of time.\r\n\r\nI recommend the same system of chick feeding for the general farm as\r\nis used on commercial plants, and I especially insist that it will\r\npay the farmer to provide meat food of some sort for his growing\r\nchicks. The amount eaten will not be large, nor need the farmer fear\r\nthat supplying the chicks with meat food will prevent their\r\nconsuming all the bugs and worms that come their way.\r\n\r\nBesides comfortable quarters, the chick to thrive, must have:\r\nExercise, water, grit, a variety of grain food, green or succulent\r\nfood, and meat food.\r\n\r\nWater should be provided in shallow dishes. This can best be\r\narranged by having a dish with an inverted can or bottle which\r\nallows only a little water to stand in the drinking basin.\r\n\r\nChicks running at large on gravelly ground need no provision for\r\ngrit. Chicks on board floors or clay soils must be provided with\r\neither coarse sand or chick grit, such as is sold for the purpose.\r\n\r\nGrain is the principal, and, too often, the only food of the chick.\r\nThe common farm way of feeding grain to young chickens is to mix\r\ncorn-meal and water and feed in a trough or on the ground. There is\r\nno particular advantage in this way of feeding, and there are\r\nseveral disadvantages. The feed is all in a bunch, and the weaker\r\nchicks are crowded out, while if wet feed is thrown on the ground or\r\nin a dirty trough the chicks must swallow the adhering filth, and if\r\nany food is left over it quickly sours and becomes a menace to\r\nhealth. Some people mix dough with sour milk and soda and bake this\r\ninto a bread. The better way is to feed all of the grain in a\r\nnatural dry condition.\r\n\r\nThere are foods in the market known as chick foods. The commercial\r\nfoods contain various grains and seeds, together with meat and grit.\r\nTheir use renders chick feeding quite a simple matter, it being\r\nnecessary to supply in addition only water and green foods. For\r\nthose who wish to prepare their own chick foods the following\r\nsuggestions are given:\r\n\r\nOatmeal is probably the best grain food for chicks. Oats cannot be\r\nsuitably prepared, however, in a common feed-mill. The hulled oats\r\nare what is wanted. They can be purchased as the common rolled oats,\r\nor sometimes as cut or pin-head oatmeal. The latter form would be\r\npreferred, but either of these is an excellent chick feed. Oats in\r\nthese forms are expensive and should be purchased in bulk, not in\r\npackages. If too expensive, oats should be used only for a few days,\r\nwhen they may be replaced by cheaper grains. Cracked corn is the\r\nbest and cheapest chick food. Flaxseed could be used in small\r\nquantities. Kaffir-corn, wheat, cow-peas--in fact any wholesome\r\ngrain--may be used, the more variety the better. Farmers possessing\r\nfeed-mills have no excuse for feeding chicks exclusively on one kind\r\nof grain. If there is no way of grinding corn on the farm, oatmeal,\r\nmillet seed and corn chop can be purchased. At about one week of age\r\nwhole Kaffir-corn, and, a little later whole wheat, can be used to\r\nreplace the more expensive feeds.\r\n\r\nGreen or bulky food of some kind is necessary to the healthy growth\r\nof young chickens. Chickens fed in litter from clover or alfalfa\r\nwill pick up many bits of leaves. This answers the purpose fairly\r\nwell, but it is advisable to feed some leafy vegetable, as kale or\r\nlettuce. The chicks should be gotten on some growing green crop as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\n\r\nChickens are not by nature vegetarians. They require some meat to\r\nthrive. It has been proven in several experiments that young\r\nchickens with an allowance of meat foods make much better growth\r\nthan chickens with a vegetable diet, even when the chemical\r\nconstituents and the variety of the two rations are practically the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nVery few farmers feed any meat whatever. They rely on insects to\r\nsupply the deficiency. This would be all right if the insects were\r\nplentiful and lasted throughout the year, but as conditions are it\r\nwill pay the farmer to supplement this source of food with the\r\ncommercial meat foods.\r\n\r\nFresh bone, cut by bone-cutters, is an excellent source of the meat\r\nand mineral matter needed by growing chicks. If one is handy to a\r\nbutcher shop that will agree to furnish fresh bones at little or no\r\ncost, it will pay to get a bone-mill, but the cost of the mill and\r\nlabor of grinding are considerable items, and unless the supply of\r\nbones is reliable and convenient this source of meat foods is not to\r\nbe depended upon.\r\n\r\nThe best way to feed beef-scrap is to keep a supply in the hopper so\r\nthe chickens may help themselves. In case meat food is given,\r\nbone-meal, fed in small quantities, will form a valuable addition to\r\ntheir ration. Infertile eggs from incubators, as well as by-products\r\nof the dairy, can be used to help out in the animal-food portion of\r\nthe ration. Chickens may be given all the milk they will drink. It\r\nis generally recommended that this be given clabbered.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeeding Laying Hens.\r\n\r\nThe food requirements of a laying hen are very like those of a\r\ngrowing chicken. One addition to the list is, however, required for\r\negg production, which is lime, of which the shell of the egg is\r\nformed. In the summer-time hens on the range will find sufficient\r\nlime to supply their needs. In the winter-time they should be\r\nsupplied with more lime than the food contains. Crushed oyster shell\r\nanswers the purpose admirably.\r\n\r\nA supply of green food is one of the requisites of successful winter\r\nfeeding. Every farmer should see that a patch of rye, crimson\r\nclover, or some other winter green crop is grown near his\r\nchicken-house. Vegetables and refuse from the kitchen help out in\r\nthis matter, but seldom furnish a sufficient supply. Vegetables may\r\nbe grown for this purpose. Mangels and sugar-beets are excellent.\r\nCabbage, potatoes and turnips answer the purpose fairly well.\r\nMangels are fed by splitting in halves and sticking to nails driven\r\nin the wall.\r\n\r\nClover and alfalfa are excellent chicken feeds and should be used in\r\nregions where winter crops will not keep green. The leaves that\r\nshatter off in the mow are the choicest portion for chicken feeding,\r\nand may be fed by scalding with hot water and mixing in a mash. Hens\r\nwill eat good green alfalfa if fed dry in a box.\r\n\r\nThe feeding of sprouted oats should be practiced when no other green\r\nfood is available. Oats may be prepared for this purpose by\r\nthoroughly soaking in warm water and being kept in a warm, damp\r\nplace for a few days. Feed when the sprouts are a couple of inches\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nAlmost all grains are suitable foods for hens. Corn, on account of\r\nits cheapness and general distribution, is the best. The general\r\nprejudice against corn feeding should be directed rather against\r\nfeeding one grain alone without the other forms of food. If hens are\r\nsupplied with green foods, with mineral matter, some form of meat\r\nfood, and are forced to take sufficient amount of exercise, the\r\ndanger from overfatness, due to the feeding of a reasonable amount\r\nof corn, need not be feared.\r\n\r\nAs has already been emphasized, the variety of food given is more\r\nessential than the kind. Do not feed one grain all the time. The\r\nmore variety fed the better. Corn and Kaffir-corn, being cheap\r\ngrains, will form the major portion of the ration, but, even if much\r\nhigher in price, it will pay to add a portion of such grain as\r\nwheat, barley, oats or buckwheat.\r\n\r\n\r\nCleanliness.\r\n\r\nThe advice commonly given in poultry papers would require one to\r\nexercise nearly as much pains in the cleaning of a chicken house as\r\nin the cleaning of a kitchen. Such advice may be suitable for the\r\ncity poultry fanciers, but it is out of place when given to the\r\nfarmer. Poultry raising, the same as other farm work, must pay for\r\nthe labor put into it, and this will not be the case if attempt is\r\nmade to follow all the suggestions of the theoretical poultry\r\nwriter.\r\n\r\nThe ease with which the premises may be kept reasonably free from\r\nlitter and filth is largely a matter of convenient arrangement. The\r\nhandiest plan from this view-point is the colony system. In this the\r\nhouses are moved to new locations when the ground becomes soiled. If\r\nthe chicken-house is a stationary structure it should be built away\r\nfrom other buildings, scrap-piles, fence corners, etc., so that the\r\nground can be frequently freshened by plowing and sowing in oats,\r\nrye or rape. The ground should be well sloped, so that the water\r\ndraining from the surface may wash away much of the filth that on\r\nlevel ground would accumulate.\r\n\r\nCleanliness indoors can be simplified by proper arrangement. First,\r\nthe house must be dry. Poultry droppings, when dry, are not a source\r\nof danger if kept out of the feed. They should be removed often\r\nenough to prevent foul odors. Drinking vessels should be rinsed out\r\nwhen refilled and not allowed to accumulate a coat of slime. If a\r\nmash is fed, feed-boards should be scraped off and dried in the sun.\r\nSunshine is a cheap and efficient disinfectant.\r\n\r\nThe advice on the control of lice and the method of handling sick\r\nchickens that has been given in the main section of the book, will\r\napply as well on the farm as on the commercial poultry plant.\r\nCertainly the farmer's time is too valuable to fool with the details\r\nof poultry therapeutics.\r\n\r\n\r\nFarm Chicken Houses.\r\n\r\nThe following notes on poultry houses apply to Iowa and Nebraska,\r\nwhere the winters are severe, and similar climates. Farther south\r\nand east the farmer should use the same style of houses as\r\nrecommended for egg farms. A chicken house just high enough for a\r\nman to walk erectly and a floor space of about 3 square feet per hen\r\nis advisable. This requires a house 12 by 24 for 100 hens, or 10 by\r\n16 for 50.\r\n\r\nLands sloping to south or southeast, and that which dries quickly\r\nafter a rain, will prove the most suitable for chickens. A gumbo\r\npatch should not be selected as a location for poultry. Hogs and\r\nhens should not occupy the same quarters, in fact, should be some\r\ndistance apart, especially if heavy breeds of chickens are kept.\r\nHens should be removed from the garden, but may be near an orchard.\r\nChicken-houses should be separated from tool-houses, stables, and\r\nother outbuildings.\r\n\r\nGrading for chicken-houses is not commonly practiced, but this is\r\nthe easiest means of preventing dampness in the house and is\r\nnecessary in heavy soils. The ground-level may be raised with a plow\r\nand scraper, or the foundation of the house may be built and filled\r\nwith dirt.\r\n\r\nA stone foundation is best, but where stone is expensive may be\r\nreplaced by cedar, hemlock or Osage orange posts, deeply set in the\r\nground. Small houses can be built on runners as described for colony\r\nhouses for an egg farm.\r\n\r\nFloors are commonly constructed of earth, boards or cement. Cement\r\nfloors are perfectly sanitary and easy to keep clean. The objections\r\nto their common use is the first cost of good cement floors. Cheaply\r\nconstructed floors will not last. Board floors are very common and\r\nare preferred by many poultrymen, but if close to the ground they\r\nharbor rats, while if open underneath they make the house cold.\r\nCovering wet ground by a board floor does not remedy the fault of\r\ndampness nearly so effectually as would a similar expenditure spent\r\nin raising the floor and surrounding ground by grading. All things\r\nconsidered, the dirt floor is the most suitable. This should be made\r\nby filling in above the outside ground-level. The drainage will be\r\nfacilitated if the first layer of this floor be of cinders, small\r\nrocks or other coarse material. Above this layer should be placed a\r\nlayer of clay, wet and packed hard, so the hens cannot scratch it\r\nup, or a different plan may be used and the floor constructed of a\r\nsandy or loamy soil of which the top layer can be renewed each year.\r\n\r\nThe walls of a chicken-house must first of all be wind-tight. This\r\nmay be attained in several ways. Upright boards with cracks battened\r\nis the cheapest method. Various kinds of lap-siding give similar\r\nresults. The single-board wall may be greatly improved by lining\r\nwith building-paper. This should be put on between the studding and\r\nsiding. Lath should also be used to prevent the paper bagging out\r\nfrom the wall. The double-board wall is the best where a warm house\r\nis desired.\r\n\r\nIt should be made by siding up outside the studding with cheap\r\nlumber. On this is placed a layer of roofing paper and over it the\r\nordinary siding. The windows of a chicken-house should furnish\r\nsufficient light that the hens may find grain in the litter on\r\ncloudy days. Too much glass in a poultry house makes the house cold\r\nat night, and it is a needless expenditure.\r\n\r\nThe subject of roofing farm buildings may be summarized in this\r\nadvice: Use patent roofing if you know of a variety that will last;\r\nif not, use shingles. Shingle roofs require a steeper pitch than do\r\nroofs of prepared roofing. A shingle roof can be made much warmer by\r\nusing tightly laid sheathing covered with building-paper. Especial\r\ncare should be taken that the joints at the eaves of the house are\r\ntightly fitted.\r\n\r\nThe object of ventilating a chicken-house is to supply a reasonable\r\namount of fresh air, and, equally important, to keep the house dry.\r\nVentilation should not be by cracks or open cupolas. Direct drafts\r\nof air are injurious, and ventilation by such means is always the\r\ngreatest when the least needed.\r\n\r\nSchemes of ventilation by a system of pipes are expensive and\r\nunnecessary. The latest, best and cheapest plan for providing\r\nventilation is the curtain front house for the north, and the open\r\nfront house for the more southerly sections. The curtain front house\r\nis giving way to the open front with a somewhat smaller opening in\r\nsections, as far north as Connecticut.\r\n\r\nMake all roosts on the same level. The ladder arrangement is a\r\nnuisance and offers no advantage. Arrange the roosts so that they\r\nmay be readily removed for cleaning. Do not fill the chicken-house\r\nfull of roosts. Put in only enough to accommodate the hens, and let\r\nthese be on one side of the house. The floor under the roosts should\r\nbe separated from the feeding floor by a board set on edge.\r\n\r\nFor laying flocks the nests must be clean, secluded and plentiful.\r\nBoxes under the roost-platform will answer, but a better plan is to\r\nhave the nest upon a shelf along a side wall so arranged as to allow\r\nthe hen to enter from the rear side. Nests should be constructed so\r\nthat all parts are accessible to a white-wash brush. The less\r\ncontrivances in a chicken-house, the better.\r\n\r\nThe farmer can get along very well without any chicken-yard at all.\r\nIt will, however, prove a very convenient arrangement if a small\r\nyard is attached to the chicken-house. The house should be arranged\r\nto open either into the yard or out into the range. This yard may be\r\nused for fattening chickens or confining cockerels, or perhaps to\r\nenclose the flock during the ripening of a favorite tomato or berry\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
