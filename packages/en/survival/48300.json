[$3.00 per Year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED CALORIC ENGINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaloric engines have long been used by the Trinity Board to provide\r\npower for working siren fog signals in connection with their\r\nlighthouses in England. They have generally been in the past of the\r\nhorizontal type, but lately a new pattern, which we illustrate from\r\n_Engineering_, has been brought out; and as the entire work of the\r\nmotor consists in driving air-compressing pumps, this form of engine\r\nshould give very good results. At one end of a beam stands the retort\r\nor furnace with the motor cylinder, and at the other end stand three\r\npumps. One of these forces air into the furnace, a second supplies the\r\nreceiver of the fog signal, while the third, which is smaller than\r\nthe second, performs the same office, when it is desired to raise the\r\npressure to a point too high for the larger pump to accomplish. As fogs\r\ncome on very suddenly, and give so little warning that it is often\r\nimpossible to get the engine into action before the vision is entirely\r\nobscured, it is customary to keep a store of air in the receiver at\r\ntwo or three times the usual working pressure, and it is from the\r\naccumulation of this pressure that the smaller pump is provided.\r\n\r\nThe furnace is a closed receiver, and is fed with coke. Air is pumped\r\ninto it at a pressure of about 30 lb. to the square inch, part being\r\ndelivered below the fuel and part above. That part which goes below\r\nrises through the incandescent coke, and appears at the surface as\r\ncarbonic oxide. Here it meets the upper air supply and burns with a\r\nfierce bright flame, producing very hot gases, which are admitted to\r\nthe cylinder and there expand, driving the piston before them. From\r\nexperiments made by Mr. C. Ingrey with engines of this kind, it appears\r\nthat they consume from 2¼ lb. to 2½ lb. of coke per brake horse power\r\nper hour, and thus provide power very economically.\r\n\r\nThe engine is regulated by a governor, which varies the proportion of\r\nair admitted above and below the fuel, and thus alters the temperature\r\nof the gases admitted to the cylinder. The distributing valves are of\r\nthe conical type, worked by tappets, and the fall is regulated by an\r\nair cushion.\r\n\r\nThese engines, for there are a pair, have been constructed by the\r\nPulsometer Engineering Company, Limited, London, for the Northern\r\nLights Commissioners, and will be erected on a lightship, probably\r\nat the North Carr. Each engine is nominally of six horse power, but\r\nactually gives ten horse power. The motor cylinder is 24 in. in\r\ndiameter, the air pump 18 in., and the compressing pumps 9 in. and 5\r\nin. respectively, all with a stroke of 18 in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED BEAM CALORIC ENGINE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNaval Architecture During the Last Half Century.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe annual lecture under the auspices of the Greenock Philosophical\r\nSociety, to commemorate the birth of James Watt, was delivered in the\r\nWatt Lecture Hall, Greenock, on January 14, by Mr. Robert Duncan,\r\nshipbuilder, Port Glasgow. The title of Mr. Duncan's paper was\r\n\"Evolution in Naval Architecture during the Reign of Queen Victoria.\"\r\nAfter referring to the early history of marine engineering, and to\r\nthe intimate connection of Greenock and the Clyde with its initial\r\nstages, Mr. Duncan went on to say that up to the date of her Majesty's\r\naccession in 1837, no systematic attempt at ocean navigation by steam\r\nhad been made. In 1812 steamship building began, but it was not till\r\n1838 that the first Atlantic steam communication began. The Sirius\r\nand the Great Western made the voyage to and from New York at the\r\nsame time, in the middle of that year, in fourteen and seventeen days\r\nrespectively, under steam all the way. Mr. Duncan then traced rapidly\r\nthe evolution of the iron ship, through the various modifications of\r\ndesign and proportion, and the simultaneous and consequent evolution\r\nof crafts to adapt themselves to the rapidly changing conditions. Mr.\r\nDuncan also described the influence upon the forms of ships of maritime\r\nlaw and of Lloyd's rules--evolution in size from the short square\r\nboxes of the early periods to the long narrow vessels of to-day; the\r\nEnterprise, for example, the first steamer to make the voyage to India\r\nby the Cape of Good Hope, being only 122 feet long, while now the cargo\r\ncarrying steamer is over 400 feet long, and the express passenger ocean\r\nsteamer over 500 feet. Mr. Duncan considers it possible that, ere her\r\nMajesty's reign closes, the Flying Scotchman of the sea will reach a\r\nlength of 800 feet, and a speed of twenty-five to thirty miles an hour.\r\nThe evolution of the man-of-war was next described, an interesting\r\nsketch given of the science of naval architecture, and a bibliography\r\nof the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Three Cylinder Locomotive.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dunmore Iron and Steel Company, at Dunmore, Pa., has a small\r\nlocomotive in use switching in its yards which is of a novel pattern.\r\nIt is thus described by the superintendent of the works: \"This little\r\nengine has three 8 X 12 in. steam cylinders, four 33 in. driving\r\nwheels, two outside connecting and parallel rods, and one inside\r\nconnecting rod. No balancing is needed in driving wheels. The engine\r\nhas six exhausts to a revolution, and the effect on the fire is good.\r\nIt is claimed that by setting the cranks at an angle of 120 degrees\r\nthe slip is reduced to a minimum. This engine makes 30 miles an hour\r\non a 40 ft. grade easily, with a light load, and is considered a good\r\nmachine by those who have run her. Its weight is about 12 tons.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Scientific American.\r\n\r\n  ESTABLISHED 1845.\r\n\r\n  MUNN & CO., Editors and Proprietors.\r\n  PUBLISHED WEEKLY AT\r\n  =No. 361 BROADWAY, NEW YORK.=\r\n\r\n  O.D.

The object of the amendment is to correct a defect in the\r\nlaw, which prevented the patentee from collecting damages in cases of\r\ninfringement.\r\n\r\nUnder the old law, the Supreme Court held that in the case, for\r\nexample, of a carpet manufacturer who complained of an infringement\r\nof his design or pattern of carpet, the complainant must clearly\r\nprove what portion of the damage, or what portion of the profit made\r\nby the infringer, was due to the use of the patented design. It was\r\npractically impossible to make this showing. Hence the infringer could\r\nimitate the patented design without liability, and the law was a\r\nnullity.\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the new law, the infringer is obliged to\r\npay the sum of $250 in any event; and if his profits are more than\r\nthat sum, he is compelled, in addition, to pay all excess of profits\r\nabove $250 to the patentee. It is believed that the penalty of $250,\r\nirrespective of profits, will put a stop to the wholesale system of\r\ninfringement heretofore carried on by unscrupulous persons.\r\n\r\nThe following is the text of the new law:\r\n\r\nAn act to amend the law relating to patents, trade marks, and copyright.\r\n\r\n_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled_, That hereafter, during the\r\nterm of letters patent for a design, it shall be unlawful for any\r\nperson other than the owner of said letters patent, without the license\r\nof such owner, to apply the design secured by such letters patent, or\r\nany colorable imitation thereof, to any article of manufacture for\r\nthe purpose of sale, or to sell or expose for sale any article of\r\nmanufacture to which such design or colorable imitation shall, without\r\nthe license of the owner, have been applied, knowing that the same\r\nhas been so applied. Any person violating the provisions, or either\r\nof them, of this section shall be liable in the amount of two hundred\r\nand fifty dollars; and in case the total profit made by him from the\r\nmanufacture or sale, as aforesaid, of the article or articles to which\r\nthe design, or colorable imitation thereof, has been applied, exceeds\r\nthe sum of two hundred and fifty dollars, he shall be further liable\r\nfor the excess of such profit over and above the sum of two hundred and\r\nfifty dollars; and the full amount of such liability may be recovered\r\nby the owner of the letters patent, to his own use, in any circuit\r\ncourt of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties, either\r\nby action at law or upon a bill in equity for an injunction to restrain\r\nsuch infringement.\r\n\r\nSEC. 2. That nothing in this act contained shall prevent,\r\nlessen, impeach, or avoid any remedy at law or in equity which any\r\nowner of letters patent for a design, aggrieved by the infringement\r\nof the same, might have had if this act had not been passed; but such\r\nowner shall not twice recover the profit made from the infringement.\r\n\r\nApproved, February 4, 1887.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARE STEEL GUNS REALLY SUPERIOR?\r\n\r\n\r\nAdmiral Porter said recently that there was little hope of building\r\nfast war ships as long as the Bureau of Steam Engineering designed the\r\nengines, for that, such was the influence of interested persons, it\r\nwas not free to choose the best devices. Whoever is familiar with the\r\nworkings of the Ordnance Bureau will admit that this, too, is similarly\r\ncontrolled. Long ago it pronounced in favor of steel guns, and like\r\na judge who records his decision and then asks to hear the evidence,\r\nthis bureau has been listening unmoved to the most convincing testimony\r\nregarding the relative efficiency of cast iron guns.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this question of steel _vs_. cast iron guns will be\r\nappreciated when it is explained that it would take at least five years\r\nafter the passage of an appropriation before the first steel gun could\r\nbe turned out, while only a twelvemonth would be required to establish\r\na cast iron gun plant.\r\n\r\nIt has never been the custom among American mechanicians to blindly\r\nfollow the lead of others, but rather to work untrammeled by\r\ntraditions; to carefully note what has already been done, and to strike\r\nout anew in whatever direction gives the most promise. Experienced gun\r\nmakers and artillerists have recently admitted that the steel rifle\r\nhas not fulfilled the promises made for it. The Krupp guns, of which\r\nwe hear so much, have never yet been subjected to such high pressures\r\nas have been applied to cast iron guns, and experience has shown it\r\nwould not be safe to put them through such tests. Indeed, the cast-iron\r\nsmooth bore guns which have been converted into rifles by the insertion\r\nof wrought iron rifled cylinders have been fired under a pressure fully\r\nthree times as great as it has been thought advisable to subject steel\r\nguns of the same caliber to. An authority says: \"Cast iron guns have\r\noften been fired hundreds of rounds under pressure of nearly seventeen\r\ntons to the square inch of bore, yet there has never been a failure,\r\nnor a sign of one. The United States has now a 12½ in. cast iron rifle\r\nconstructed on the same plan as the 8 in. converted rifle. This gun was\r\nmade ten years ago, as an experiment. It has been fired with charges as\r\nhigh as two hundred pounds of hexagonal or quick powder (as compared\r\nwith powder now considered suitable), and is still serviceable. The\r\nUnited States has another experimental 12 in. rifle, entirely of cast\r\niron. It has been fired more than a hundred rounds with high power\r\ncharges (265 pounds powder, 800 pound shot), and is still serviceable.\"\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, the experiments with these guns ceased at the very\r\ntime when there was the most reason for continuing them, to wit, while\r\nthey were giving evidence of their ability to stand a long series\r\nof continuous rounds. The mode of testing a high pressure gun, upon\r\nwhich all authorities agree, is to fire it, round after round, until\r\nit bursts or shows weakness. There is authority for the statement\r\nthat there is not a 12 inch steel gun in Europe which has been fired\r\ntwo hundred rounds, and yet, just as soon as these cast iron guns\r\ngave promise of withstanding successfully such a test, a peremptory\r\norder came from the Ordnance Bureau to cease firing and stop further\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nThe failure of steel guns in Europe is frequent, though there is good\r\nreason for the belief that we only hear of a tithe of them, the balance\r\nbeing kept secret. Only the other day a big steel gun exploded at\r\nthe muzzle, on the French trial grounds, and news comes that both in\r\nthe war ships Collingwood and Ajax a number of steel guns have been\r\ncondemned.\r\n\r\nBecause of these facts it is not at all surprising that the majority\r\nin the House of Representatives, though willing to appropriate money\r\nfor guns, are averse to having the outlay controlled by the Ordnance\r\nBureau, which is wedded to the steel gun theory and others not much\r\nbetter sustained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COCAINE HABIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nA number of cases of confirmed cocaine habit have recently been\r\nreported. While some of them lack confirmation, it is certain that\r\nseveral physical and mental wrecks have been caused by the excessive\r\nuse of this alkaloid. The South American Indians, long famous as coca\r\neaters, seem as a rule not to succumb to its effects. They use the\r\ndried leaf, which they chew, previously introducing a small amount of\r\nalkali, to set the cocaine free. In civilized countries the alkaloid\r\nas a chloride is usually employed, and is administered by hypodermic\r\ninjection.\r\n\r\nThe practice of using it habitually in excess is hitherto reported as\r\nalmost confined to physicians. Its effects upon its victims are very\r\nsad. The brain becomes permanently or for a period affected, a species\r\nof lunacy being produced. Just as in the case of opium eaters, the\r\nmoral nature is undermined. One doctor was reported, so recently as to\r\nbe within the memory of our readers, as having turned on the gas in\r\na drug store where the alkaloid was refused him, with the design of\r\nasphyxiating the clerk, in which attempt he nearly succeeded. Another\r\ndoctor, within a space of some sixteen months, has gone insane from the\r\ncocaine habit and has been removed to an asylum, leaving his wife also\r\nill from the effects of the same drug, with which he had experimented\r\non her.\r\n\r\nIf the cases continue to multiply, there may be room for questioning\r\nthe utility to man of the discovery of this anæsthetic. It is doubtful\r\nif all the services in local anæsthesia rendered by it can compensate\r\nfor the ill it has already done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPyrofuxin--a New Tanning Substance from Coal.\r\n\r\n\r\nA new extract of coal is being introduced in Germany for industrial\r\npurposes, especially for tanning leather and disinfection generally, to\r\nwhich the name \"pyrofuxin\" is given by the discoverer, Professor Paulus\r\nReinsch, of Erlangen, Bavaria. Unlike the generality of such compounds,\r\nthis new material is not a derivative of coal tar, or of any of the\r\ndistillates of coal, but is obtained directly from coal itself. Pit or\r\nbituminous coal contains most of it, and is prepared for treatment by\r\nbeing broken into nuts. The crude pyrofuxin is extracted by repeated\r\nboilings in a solution of caustic soda. The pyrofuxin enters into\r\nsolution, and is allowed to stand for a time. It is then poured off,\r\nand a carbonic acid gas is passed through it. The resultant liquor has\r\na specific gravity of 1.025 to 1.030, and holds from 10 to 15 grammes\r\nof pyrofuxin to the liter. In its purified form the compound is a fine,\r\nnon-triturable substance, without taste or smell, non-poisonous, and\r\nin appearance like catechu. Some Russian coals contain 18 per cent\r\nof pyrofuxin. After the extraction of this material the coal remains\r\ncombustible. It is described as being one of the most powerful and\r\neffective antiseptics known to science. On this account it is expected\r\nto be most valuable for tanning, as being twenty-eight times quicker in\r\naction than bark, and producing a better result at decreased cost.\r\n\r\nIt will be soon enough to give credence to this alleged leather tanning\r\nagent when specimens of good leather are produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeight and Power of Modern Guns.--Table of Armstrong Guns.\r\n\r\n\r\n

us, is now being successfully\r\nworked in London, and is thus described in _Engineering_:\r\n\r\nUp to the present this novel method of manufacture has been kept rather\r\nsecret, but now, owing to the success achieved by a plant erected and\r\nworked on a commercial scale, we are enabled, through the courtesy\r\nof Mr. H. Y. Castner, to lay before our readers an outline sketch of\r\nthe method of operation which is followed, and which we have seen\r\ncarried out with success at his works, 65 Belvidere Road, Lambeth. Few\r\npersons outside of the chemical profession are aware of the commercial\r\nexistence of the metal sodium or of its uses, and even among those\r\nfollowing that profession but little is known, except that it is\r\nused in the manufacture of aluminum, and is very expensive. Much has\r\nlately been published in various scientific journals throughout the\r\nworld upon the subject of alleged new processes, whereby that highly\r\ninteresting metal--aluminum--might be cheaply produced without sodium,\r\nand thus be made to take in the commercial world a place to which its\r\nvaried valuable properties entitle it. So far nothing has resulted from\r\nthese numerous so-called discoveries, and at the present time the only\r\nprocess in use whereby aluminum can be produced is that devised by and\r\ndue to Deville's ingenuity.[1] This process has been called the sodium\r\nprocess, apparently to distinguish it from others, but seeing that it\r\nis the only process which has ever proved practical, it is somewhat of\r\na mystery why it needed to be so distinguished.\r\n\r\n[1] The Cowles electric smelting process, heretofore described by us,\r\nhas only produced aluminum alloys as yet, and it is doubtful whether it\r\ncan be made to do more than this.\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Walter Weldon, in a paper read before the Society of\r\nChemical Industry a few years ago, clearly resolved the great question\r\nof cheaply producing aluminum, and showed by argument that this end\r\nwas only to be gained in either of the two following directions,\r\nnamely, first, by the production of cheap sodium and the employment of\r\nDeville's process, and second, by the discovery of a substitute for\r\nsodium, which has hitherto given to aluminum its excessive cost in\r\nproduction. After twenty-five years of research by some of the best\r\nscientists of the present age, no substance has been found that will\r\nreplace sodium, and although every known substance has, at various\r\ntimes, been proposed, none has been successful. So discouraging has\r\nbeen the research, that those familiar with the subject have almost\r\nabandoned hope of ever seeing aluminum cheaply manufactured by chemical\r\nprocesses, believing also that Weldon's first proposition was an\r\nimpossibility.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this article to enter into a lengthy\r\ndiscussion of Mr. Castner' process of producing sodium, as Mr. James\r\nMactear, F.C.S., is about to prepare a scientific paper on the subject,\r\nto be read on March 7 before the Society of Chemical Industry. We\r\nshall content ourselves by presenting to our readers a short practical\r\ndescription of the process and its results.\r\n\r\nBefore doing so it will, however, be advantageous to give a short\r\naccount of the method by which sodium has hitherto been separated from\r\nits compounds, in order that a clearer conception of the features in\r\nwhich the new process differs from the old one may be obtained. At\r\nhigh temperatures carbon has the property of separating sodium from\r\nits oxygen compounds, carbon uniting with the oxygen to form carbonic\r\noxide, the sodium being thereby liberated. In the usual process this\r\nreaction is brought about by mixing carbonate of soda, lime, and carbon\r\nin small wrought iron cylinders, and exposing them to an intense heat,\r\nwhen a part of the sodium comes off as vapor. The lime is added to\r\nprevent fusion, for were the mass to melt, the carbon would float on\r\nthe top, and could no longer attack the soda. The new process differs\r\nfrom the old principally in working with a fused mass of soda compound,\r\nthis operation having been rendered feasible by the most ingenious\r\ndevice of weighting every particle of carbon with iron, so that the\r\ntwo chemicals--soda and carbon--are kept in perfect admixture, and\r\nare continually presenting fresh surfaces to each other as the liquid\r\ncirculates in the crucible under the action of the heat. By this simple\r\nbut beautiful plan of weighting the carbon, it is rendered possible to\r\nemploy a soda compound which is decomposed at a much lower temperature\r\nthan that hitherto used, and to carry on the process in large and\r\ndurable vessels, instead of in small cylinders, which have a very short\r\nlife. Having thus given a short account of the chemical process, we\r\nwill describe the commercial method of manufacture.\r\n\r\nThe operations are carried on in large cast steel crucibles, and\r\nthe charges consist of caustic soda and a finely ground artificial\r\ncompound of carbon and iron, which is the reducing agent. This compound\r\nis made by coking a mixture of fine iron and pitch. The crucibles\r\ncontaining these materials are first heated in a small furnace at\r\na low temperature, the object being to expel the hydrogen from the\r\ncaustic alkali and bring about quiet fusion. The crucibles are then\r\nremoved from this furnace, by means of a little truck, and placed upon\r\na movable platform, which is operated by hydraulic power. They are\r\nthen by this means raised into the large furnace, where the crucible\r\ncovers are fixed stationary. The edges of the crucible and cover coming\r\ntogether form a tight joint, and from this cover projects a small tube\r\nto the outside of the furnace into a narrow rectangular box, known as\r\nthe condenser. The reduction of the sodium commences soon after the\r\ncrucible containing the charge is in its place, the vapors and gases\r\npassing from the fused mixture through the exit pipe from the cover\r\ninto the condenser, where the metallic vapors are condensed to metal,\r\nwhile the uncondensed gases escape by a small outlet tube. After the\r\ncharge is exhausted, the crucible is lowered, and one containing a\r\nfresh charge raised in its place; in this manner the process might\r\nalmost be called continuous.\r\n\r\nThe actual temperature used in this process to bring about reduction,\r\nas measured by experts, has been found to be 850° Cent. By the older\r\nmethod the temperature necessary is about 1,400° Cent. This is\r\npractically the great point of economy in this process, as the high\r\nprice of sodium has hitherto been owing to the excessive heat used in\r\nthe older process and the consequent destruction of the wrought iron\r\nvessels. Sodium at present costs about four shillings per pound to\r\nproduce, while the materials necessary for this quantity, were nothing\r\nwasted, would hardly cost four pence. The difference between these two\r\nfigures represents the wear and tear to the furnace, the destruction\r\nof the wrought iron cylinders, the loss and waste of materials, the\r\nexcessive labor and care necessary to employ in manufacturing, and\r\nfuel. Approximately, the cost of these items in producing one pound of\r\nsodium by the older process is as follows:\r\n\r\nTwo shillings is due to the destruction of wrought iron, etc.\r\n\r\nOne shilling is due to the loss and waste of materials, of which three\r\ntimes the theoretical quantity must be employed.\r\n\r\nEightpence is due to the labor.\r\n\r\nFourpence is due to the fuel.\r\n\r\nMr. Castner seems justified in his claim to produce sodium at a\r\nshilling per pound in large quantities. The steel crucibles which have\r\nnow been in use some time show but little wear, and indicate indefinite\r\nuse in future, thus reducing the first item of cost in the older\r\nprocess to a fraction. There is hardly any appreciable loss or waste\r\nof materials, and from four pennyworth of caustic soda is ultimately\r\nobtained one pound of sodium. The labor is a very small item of\r\nexpense, and the fuel consumed is less than one-third that used in the\r\nolder process.\r\n\r\nSeventy-five tons of fuel are required by the older method in producing\r\none ton of sodium. From actual results a like amount of fuel will\r\nproduce over three tons of sodium by Mr. Castner's process. The results\r\nfrom this new process are not obtained by calculations on paper, as\r\nthe inventor has shown from actual working that his claims are well\r\nfounded. The process is no longer an experimental one, the furnace\r\nnow erected having a capacity of 120 pounds of sodium per day, which\r\nis probably more than is produced at any works now in existence. The\r\nproduction of sodium at one shilling a pound by this process may be\r\nconsidered an accomplished fact, which ultimately means cheapened\r\naluminum and a solution of the problem that has so long engaged the\r\nattention of chemists and metallurgists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreventive Medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. C. R. Illingworth thus writes in the _Med. Press:_\r\n\r\nOne of our great aims as physicians is to prevent disease; another is\r\nto cut short its course when developed. Our power in these directions\r\nfinds full scope among that class of disorders now generally recognized\r\nas depending upon the reception, growth, and development in the tissues\r\nof micro-organic life in one shape or another. By the continual\r\nsuppression of the growth and development of these forms of cell life,\r\nwe may, indeed, hope at length to erase the names of the diseases they\r\ncause from the category of those \"ills that flesh is heir to.\" The\r\ndiseases I refer to are scarlet fever, diphtheria, measles, whooping\r\ncough, rheumatic fever, chicken-pox, small-pox, syphilis, hydrophobia,\r\nyellow fever, _et hoc genus omne._\r\n\r\nThe germicide remedy I have found to answer as a specific and\r\nprophylactic in such diseases is the biniodide of mercury given in\r\nsolution of potassic iodide. In all cases of scarlatina or measles\r\noccurring in one member of a family, I put the rest upon preventive\r\nmedicine. Thus, for children I prescribe as follows: Bichloride of\r\nmercury solution, ℥ iss; iodide of potassium, ʒ j; ammonio-citrate of\r\niron, ʒ j; sirup, ℥ iss; water to eight ounces. One or two teaspoonfuls\r\nto be given three times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Peace Army of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following figures are believed to be approximately accurate, and\r\nmost interesting and instructive they are:\r\n\r\n  French army, peace footing.                      523,283\r\n  German army, peace footing.                      445,417\r\n  United States army of pensioners, peace footing. 400,000\r\n\r\nOne of the great evils of a huge standing army is the cost of its\r\nsupport--a constant drain upon the national resources.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem that in this respect we have so very much the\r\nadvantage of France or Germany, loaded down as those nations are with\r\nmilitary burdens.\r\n\r\nThe great difference is that, while all or nearly all of the French and\r\nGerman soldiers, supported at the national expense, are available in\r\ncase of a national emergency, few or none of ours are.\r\n\r\nIs this enormous burden a just debt?\r\n\r\nThe question is best answered by another question. Is it not fair to\r\nassume that in 1877, twelve years after the end of the civil war, about\r\nall the equitable claims for pensions on account of that war had been\r\nput in and allowed?\r\n\r\nYet since 1877, the number of pensioners on our rolls has almost\r\ndoubled; and the annual cost of maintaining them has nearly\r\ntrebled.--_N. Y. Sun._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Solid Life Insurance Company.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe figures of the last annual report of the New York Life Insurance\r\nCompany, just issued, present a record of almost unexampled success in\r\nthe conduct of the business of that old and strong company for the past\r\nyear. Its income for the year was $19,230,408, it paid policy holders\r\n$7,627,230, and it has cash assets amounting to $75,421,453. It goes\r\nwithout the saying that this great company does its insurance business\r\non strictly business principles. It recognizes the policy holder's\r\nright to paid-up insurance in case of a discontinuance of payment of\r\npremiums, and its policies are notably free from restrictions as to\r\noccupation, residence, and travel. The company issues a great variety\r\nof policies, thus adapting its contracts to the wants of almost every\r\none having present means from which a small percentage can be spared\r\nfor the benefit of themselves or those dependent upon them at a future\r\ndate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. GILES DE LA TOURETTE has recently published a monograph\r\nupon normal locomotion and the variations in the gait caused by\r\ndiseases of the nervous system. He found, from a comparison of a large\r\nnumber of cases, that the average length of pace is, for men, 25\r\ninches; for women, 20 inches. The step with the right foot is somewhat\r\nlonger than that with the left. The feet are separated laterally in\r\nwalking about 4½ inches in men and about 5 inches in women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERY WHEELS FOR GUMMING SAWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the illustration herewith, the operation of gumming saws with an\r\nemery wheel is vividly represented, the frame affording sufficient\r\nsupport for the side of the saw where the teeth are being ground, and\r\nthe arrangement being a simple one, readily made at any work bench or\r\nmachine where a shaft is run upon which an emery wheel can be placed.\r\nThe operation itself involves only the simplest mechanical knowledge\r\nand but a rudimentary experience in the handling of tools, yet the\r\ndesirability of this method of sharpening saws is largely dependent\r\nupon the kind of emery wheel used and the rate of speed at which it is\r\nrun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EMERY VULCANITE SAW GUMMER.]\r\n\r\nThe vulcanite emery wheels made by the New York Belting and Packing\r\nCompany have especial advantages for this kind of work. They are strong\r\nand safe at the highest speed at which it is desirable to run them, the\r\ncompany recommending that they never be run at a less rate than 6,000\r\nfeet per minute circumferential speed, and from that up to 8,000 and\r\n10,000 feet per minute, although the lowest named speed is rather above\r\nthe ordinary limit of many other kinds of emery wheels, and attempts to\r\nrun other wheels at or beyond this limit have frequently resulted in\r\nserious accidents, from the breaking of the wheels. The higher rate of\r\nspeed, which not only cuts faster, but, in the case of the vulcanite\r\nemery wheel, prolongs the life of the wheel, is concededly safe with\r\nthe vulcanite wheel. Thus run, it is not likely to wear out of true,\r\nthe operator does not have to bear on so hard, and the wheel retains\r\nits shape much better than when run at a slow speed. The nature of the\r\nwear of the working surface in the vulcanite wheel is claimed to be\r\nessentially different from that in wheels where the emery is fixed in\r\nits place by other methods, the rubber affording an elastic foundation\r\nor cushion, from which the particles of emery slightly protrude. This\r\nnot only insures more efficient work from the cutting edges of the\r\nemery, as they become changed by use, but allows of more access of air\r\nto the work, thus tending to prevent casehardening of the edges of the\r\nmetal being ground.\r\n\r\nIn addition to wheels with bevel shaped grinding surfaces, as\r\nrepresented in the engraving, the company also make wheels with round\r\ngrinding surfaces, and this kind is always considered best for large\r\nsaws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRILLED SHARK--THE OLDEST LIVING TYPE OF VERTEBRATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn technical terms this is a living species of cladodont shark, named\r\nby Mr. Garman _Chlamydoselachus anguineus._\r\n\r\nThe specimen here figured was found in a miscellaneous collection\r\nof fishes, etc., in alcohol, furnished the Museum of Comparative\r\nZoology by Professor H. A. Ward, who purchased them in Japan. It\r\nwas soon recognized as not only belonging to a new family, but one\r\nclosely allied to certain forms supposed to have become extinct in\r\nthe Carboniferous time. This discovery displaces _Ceratodus_ from the\r\nposition of the oldest living type of the vertebrata.\r\n\r\nThe term Chlamydoselachus is applied on account of the curious\r\nfrill-like mantle that surmounts the first gill cover. The term is made\r\nup of two Greek words implying mantle and shark. Six gill openings,\r\nand certain structure of the brain, remove this form from the present\r\nknown sharks. Its affinity to some of the earliest known sharks, those\r\nof the middle Devonian, render it of great interest and importance to\r\nscience. The family characters which this form represents, under the\r\nterm _Chlamydoselachidæ_, are: Body elongate, with a depressed head.\r\nThe eyes are lateral, with no nictitating membrane. The nasal cavity is\r\nseparate from that of the mouth. The mouth is situated anteriorly, like\r\nthat of some fishes. The teeth have broad, backward extended bases and\r\nslender cusps. The spiracles are present. One dorsal fin, spineless,\r\nis present. There is also an anal fin, and a caudal with no pit at its\r\nroot. The first gill cover is free across the isthmus. The intestine\r\nhas a spiral valve.\r\n\r\nThe generic characters are: Six gill openings, opercular flap, first\r\ngill cover, broad. Teeth similar in both jaws; each with three slender,\r\ncurved, subconical cusps, separated by a pair of rudimentary denticles\r\nor a broad base. There is no median upper series of teeth in front, but\r\nthere is a series below, on the symphysis. The mouth is wide, and has\r\nno labial folds at the angles. The pupil is horizontally elongate; the\r\nfins are broad, the caudal without a notch.\r\n\r\nThe total length of this shark is nearly five feet. Its greatest width,\r\nacross the ventrals, is seven inches. Its resemblance to a snake is\r\nvery striking. Its elongated body, long, flattened head, anterior\r\nmouth, and sinister expression of the eyes are quite suggestive of the\r\nophidians. There are fifty-one rows of teeth, and six teeth in each\r\nrow; the whole number at one time in function is 306. The brain is very\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nThe present state of icthyological science recognizes eliminations\r\nthat have been made from its main body. Comprehensively, a fish is a\r\ncold-blooded vertebrate, adapted for life in the water, breathing by\r\nmeans of gills, having the limbs, if present, in the form of fins, the\r\nsmaller members being represented by cartilaginous rays connected by\r\nmembrane. One or more fins are developed on the median line of the body.\r\n\r\nThe lancelets, myzonts, myxinoids, hag fishes, lampreys, sharks, and\r\nrays are recognized as differing sufficiently from the true fishes to\r\nentitle them to places of class distinction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FRILLED SHARK--THE OLDEST LIVING TYPE OF\r\nVERTEBRATES.]\r\n\r\nThe true fishes form one class; the elasmobranchs, sharks, and rays,\r\nanother class; the marsipobranchs, myxinoid fishes, hag fishes, and\r\nlampreys, a class; and the lancelets and cirrostomes, a class. It will\r\nbe seen, then, that technically there are four classes of fish-like\r\nvertebrates, where but one--fishes--has heretofore been recognized.\r\nThe lancelets, as is well known, are the lowest in the scale,\r\ntheir structure being extremely simple. The skull in this class is\r\nundeveloped, the brain not distinctly differentiated, nor is there any\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nThe term Leptocardii, which designates this class, means thin heart, in\r\nreference to the simplicity of this portion of the arterial system.\r\n\r\nAt first sight of the mouth of the frilled shark, which is figured\r\nhere, the teeth have a singular and wholly unnatural appearance,\r\nappearing like indented, leaf-like organs; but it is seen that there\r\nare three fangs, serpent-like, on a base, and several rows of them give\r\nthe peculiar appearance, arranged as they are consecutively from before\r\ninward.\r\n\r\nThe Port Jackson sharks, of the family _Heterodontidæ_, have long been\r\nregarded as of great interest to paleontologists, from their being\r\nclosely related to some extinct sharks. Under the term Cestracion (now\r\n_Gyropleurodus_), these sharks are known to naturalists. A species, _G.\r\nfrancisci_, is now found off the coast of California.\r\n\r\n_Cestracion phillipi_ is found in the Australian seas. The term\r\ncestracion is from the Greek _kestra_, a weapon. Many of the extinct\r\nspecies are known by the preservation of this spine, which being of\r\nmore durable structure is preserved after all other traces of the\r\ncreature have passed away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TICHENOR & WALKER'S IMPROVED STUMP PULLER. [FOR\r\nDESCRIPTION SEE PAGE 132.] ]\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the frilled shark, as seen in our engraving, is peculiar\r\nappearing for a shark, as this important part is usually situated far\r\nbeneath. In this respect, the anterior aspect of the mouth, there is\r\nresemblance to that of the great rhinodon, the largest living fish,\r\nmeasuring 70 feet in length. The general appearance of this shark\r\nis, however, extremely different from that of the frilled shark. The\r\nrhinodon is immensely bulky, the head being quite as deep and wide as\r\nany other portion. A very interesting structure, and one little known,\r\nbelonging to the latter is a set of whalebone-like fringes along the\r\ngills, arranged comb-like. These frills have much the same functions\r\nof those in the whalebone or right whales. The food of the creature\r\nis mostly of sea jellies and other soft pelagic animals, which are\r\nstrained into the throat by means of this adaptation. The great basking\r\nshark has this structure. This shark has been taken off Block Island\r\nmeasuring, according to authority, nearly seventy feet. It is the\r\n_Cetorhinus_, or bone shark, also so called. Large as these creatures\r\nare, they are harmless, most fortunately, their teeth being very small.\r\nTheir food being of gelatinous animal matter, the masticating apparatus\r\nis not required to be of any considerable size or strength. The more\r\nharmful sharks are of moderate dimensions, in which the teeth are very\r\nlarge. In the largest species of \"maneater\" shark living, the teeth\r\nare about two inches in length. Some of the great carcharodon-like\r\nfossil sharks have teeth measuring five inches and a half in length.\r\nOne in my possession has that measurement. Judging from the size of\r\nthe shark, which has a tooth two inches in length, the extinct species\r\nhere indicated must have been much over one hundred feet in length.\r\nSuch enormous size can more readily be accommodated in the vast ocean\r\nthan that of the great land beasts on their appropriate element. I am\r\nindebted to papers on this subject by Mr. Garman, of Cambridge, Mass.,\r\nfor material of this account. J. B. H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMMEDIATELY after eating, a person weighs more than before it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMBINED BENCH AND IRONING BOARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bench is composed of side pieces, legs, end pieces, and a central\r\ncross brace. At one end it is provided with stationary top pieces\r\nhaving curved inner edges, as shown in the upper view, which are\r\ncovered with a thin strip of angle iron extending up flush with the\r\ntop and bent to conform with the curved edge. To the upper ends of the\r\nlegs are hinged supports adapted to extend upward to form continuations\r\nof the legs, to engage with and hold an ironing board in a horizontal\r\nposition. A tongue formed upon the free end of each support enters a\r\nsocket box fitted in a recess formed in the board, so that the hinged\r\nlids of the boxes are flush with the bench surface of the board. When\r\nthe board is in position to be ironed upon, the hinged lids rest\r\nagainst the sides of the supports, an opening in the lids receiving\r\npins projecting from the sides of the supports. The lids are held in\r\nthis position by suitably arranged buttons. By this means the ironing\r\nboard is securely fixed in its elevated position. The rigidity of each\r\nsupport is promoted by another button attached to its inner side, and\r\nwhich enters a slot in the top edge of the side piece. To convert the\r\nironing board into a bench, the board is lifted up and the supports\r\nclosed down within the bench, as shown in the lower view. The wraps\r\nused upon the board are then placed neatly over the supports. The board\r\nitself is then turned over and its narrow end slid under the projection\r\nof the angle iron to a bearing upon the upper edges of the bench\r\nframe. The board now forms a smooth top for the bench. The under side\r\nof the ironing board, when forming a seat, is recessed near each side\r\nof its square end. Each recess is covered by a metal plate having a\r\ndiamond-shaped opening to receive the elongated head of a bolt secured\r\nto the inner face of the bench side pieces. The square end of the board\r\nis thus held to the bench, the narrow end being held by the angle irons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WELLER'S COMBINED BENCH AND IRONING BOARD.]\r\n\r\nThis invention has been patented by Mr. Daniel H. Weller, of Boyertown,\r\nPa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED BLIND STOP.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GULICK'S IMPROVED BLIND STOP.]\r\n\r\nBy means of the simple attachment here shown, the blind may be securely\r\nheld in any desired position. Secured to the lower cross bar is a\r\nmetal plate, bent at right angles to form flanges, the projecting one\r\nof which is finely corrugated. The plate is held to the bar by screws\r\npassing through the other flange. Across the face of the outer flange\r\nis secured a spring retaining strip, which bears against the corrugated\r\nface and which carries a set screw. To the end of the slat bar is\r\nsecured a corrugated strip, which is passed between the flange and its\r\nstrip, the corrugated faces resting against each other, as shown in the\r\nright hand view.\r\n\r\nThis device will hold the slats in any required position, but when the\r\nslat bar is subjected to a positive pull, the strip will slip upon the\r\nface of the flange, against which it will be held by the action of the\r\nspring strip. By means of the set screw, the parts may be so locked\r\ntogether as to prevent the turning of the slats from the outside.\r\n\r\nThis invention has been patented by Mrs. Lizzie T. Gulick, of\r\nCorsicana, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe British Armament at Victoria.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome mistake appears to have been made in the recent announcement that\r\nthe British Government are sending out a number of eighty ton guns\r\nfor the coast defense of Esquimault and Victoria. Twelve sixty-four\r\npounders have been sent out from England, not for the armaments of the\r\nforts, but to be placed on board the British ships of war belonging to\r\nthe Pacific squadron or to go into the naval reserves. Some time ago\r\nthe British Minister of War made application to the Canadian Pacific\r\nRailway to know if they could transport one or more eighty ton guns\r\nover their road. An estimate of the cost was given, with the model of\r\na car composed of three trucks, which it was proposed to use if the\r\nshipment was made. Since then nothing has been heard of the eighty ton\r\nguns. The officer in command of the British Columbia district does not\r\nspeak very creditably of the condition of the armament at that point.\r\nThe artillery armament is described as old, the carriages and limbers\r\nare reported rotten and are falling to pieces, while the guns are\r\nwithout sights. The batteries at Victoria and Esquimault, the officers\r\nsay, are in a discreditable condition.--_N. Y. Evening Post_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SIMPLE DEVICE FOR CRIMPING BOOTS OR SHOES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LA FOLLETTE'S BOOT CRIMPER.]\r\n\r\nThe crimper herewith illustrated has a yoke-shaped stationary portion,\r\nthe jaws of which are formed with transverse corrugations. The top\r\nof this yoke has a longitudinal slot, in which are pivoted the upper\r\nreduced ends of movable inner jaws, whose operative faces have\r\ntransverse corrugations, arranged to always meet and fit within the\r\ncorresponding corrugations of the outer jaws. These inner jaws are\r\nnormally held open by a spring. The operating or crimping screw slides\r\nfreely through the slot in the yoke, extending between the inner jaws,\r\nand on its lower portion fits a wedge-shaped clamping block, which is\r\ndrawn up between the inner jaws by turning the operating screw. The\r\nouter end of this screw being placed in an aperture in the heel of the\r\nlast, or in other suitable position relative to a form over which the\r\nleather is to be crimped, and the edges of the leather placed between\r\nthe jaws, the leather may be strained about its forming block as\r\ndesired by simply rotating the screw.\r\n\r\nThis invention has been patented by Mr. Elery B. La Follette, of\r\nFlemington, West Va.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLASTERER'S HAWK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of this invention, which has been patented by Mr. Geo.\r\nW. Jaques, of Burton, O., is to provide a plasterer's hawk in which\r\nthe board on which the mortar is received, and which is subjected to\r\nexpansion and contraction due to alternate moistening and drying, may\r\nbe rendered light and rigid and, at the same time, be free to expand\r\nand contract without warping or cracking. In the center of the board\r\nis secured a bolt, upon which is received a handle having a nut in its\r\nouter end fitting the end of the bolt. A circular concave plate is\r\nplaced on the bolt, between the handle and board, with its concave side\r\ntoward the board. Between the plate and board is held an elastic rubber\r\nwasher, which is compressed by screwing the handle down.\r\n\r\nThe plate has a plane edge, which is secured to the board by screws,\r\nand in the edge are four notches for receiving the ends of wire frames\r\nthat extend a short distance under the plate, by which they are clamped\r\nto the board. Each frame consists of a wire, bent to the shape shown\r\nin the upper view in the engraving. Through the end loops are passed\r\nscrews, projecting from the board, and the center of each frame is\r\nsecured to the board by a clip, the clips and bolt being arranged in a\r\nline parallel with the grain of the wood. The frames support the edges\r\nof the board, and the loops permit of the lateral movement of their\r\nscrews and the portions of the board by which they are carried. This\r\nhawk weighs, even when thoroughly soaked, only one pound and a half,\r\nthe old style weighing from three to five pounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAQUES' PLASTERER'S HAWK.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADJUSTABLE WOOD MEASURING RACK.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy means of this device wood may be measured by the cord or fractional\r\nparts of a cord, as occasion may require. The sill frame consists of\r\ntwo longitudinally ranging timbers connected by cross bars. Near one\r\nend of the timbers are fixed uprights, braced to each other and to\r\nthe timbers. To the inner faces of the sills are screwed a series of\r\nheaded pins, the first one being exactly one foot from the inner face\r\nof the end posts, and the others being spaced one foot apart. Two\r\nposts, braced together by rods, are adapted to stand on the sills, and\r\nto the inside face of each post is attached, by coach screws, a metal\r\nplate provided with a hook at its lower end, adapted to engage with\r\nthe shank of one of the headed screw pins of the sills. Attached to\r\neach post is a brace with two arms, and formed at its lower end with a\r\nnotch to engage the pins on the sills. The metal plates and braces are\r\nslotted for the passage of the screws, so that the movable frame may be\r\nquickly and easily set perfectly plumb, whichever opposite pair of the\r\nsill pins may be engaged by the hooked plates. The posts are exactly\r\nfour feet high, and one is marked by cross lines one foot apart. It is\r\napparent that, to measure a cord, the frame is moved to the eighth set\r\nof pins and the wood is piled to the tops of the posts. To measure half\r\na cord, the hooks are engaged with the fourth pins. By adjusting the\r\nhooks to the first pair of pins, and filling the wood in between the\r\nend posts up to the first cross line on the post, a single foot of wood\r\ncan be measured, or up to the second line for two feet, and so on. Thus\r\na cord or any fractional part can be readily measured. To disengage the\r\nframe, it is only necessary to tilt it forward toward the fixed posts,\r\nwhen it may be shifted to any point along the sill frame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BROUGHTON'S ADJUSTABLE WOOD MEASURING RACK.]\r\n\r\nThis invention has been patented by Mr. Horace L.

All its parts\r\nare movable and convenient of access (not being screwed in), its\r\nworking so complete that an inexperienced person can operate it with\r\nsuccess and perfectness. Its adaptability to all classes of boilers,\r\nsuch as stationary, portable, traction, marine, and locomotive, and\r\nits working on each, makes it very desirable, and recommends it to all\r\nclasses of engineers. The automatic working of this injector is of very\r\ngreat advantage, as by this mechanical construction it works under all\r\nconditions of shakes, jars, and concussions. In case of a break, or\r\nthe suction is to be removed and then returned, it picks up or begins\r\nworking without any aid, assistance, or attention from the engineer,\r\nthereby relieving of much care and annoyance. Its convenience of access\r\nis of very great consideration and importance, owing to the advantage\r\nof cleaning and examining its interior parts.\r\n\r\nThe working parts of this injector are stationary in their work,\r\nthereby causing comparatively no wear in its mechanical parts. The\r\ninventor seems to have combined common sense with mechanical science,\r\nby leaving out all complications, and combining in the injector every\r\nconvenience of operating, getting at, and putting it on the boiler.\r\n\r\nThe body is of a single cylinder or barrel, with two jets inside,\r\n\"steam and combining,\" and governed by an automatic swinging overflow.\r\nThe injector is operated by the opening or closing of the globe\r\nvalves. It is connected to the boiler and pipes with uniform and\r\ninterchangeable square centered unions, and can be put on or taken\r\noff very quickly without any annoyance or injury, and the only tool\r\nrequired being an ordinary wrench.\r\n\r\nAnother great point gained in this injector is its great range of\r\nworking capacity. It will lift water twenty-five feet perpendicular,\r\nor take it a hydraulic pressure and force it into the boiler at a\r\ntemperature of from 140° to 180° Fah. It will work under a steam\r\npressure of from 20 to 140 lb. It will also lift and force water\r\nat a very warm temperature (say 120° Fah.) in tank or well, and\r\nunder all circumstances and at all points it works automatically.\r\nThe inventor and manufacturers of the Penberthy injector have great\r\nconfidence in its working qualities, and to satisfy engineers of its\r\nmerits and perfectness of work, solicit a trial. From observation, a\r\nbrilliant future is in store for this little wonder of simplicity and\r\ncompactness, which is a model of mechanism in appearance and finish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PENBERTHY INJECTOR.]\r\n\r\nFor prices, etc., address Jenkins Bros., 71 John St., New York, 13\r\nSo. 4th St. Philadelphia, and 105 Milk St., Boston, agents for this\r\ninjector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTOR FOR LADIES' HATS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis simple and readily adjustable protector may be quickly applied\r\nto and removed from a hat or bonnet, without injuring its delicate\r\ntrimmings, and may be adjusted to fit large or small hats. The main\r\nportion of the protector, which alone will be used to cover hats of\r\nsmall or medium size, consists of a piece of some light waterproof\r\nfabric strengthened about the margin with an inside facing. At the\r\ninner face of the body are secured a couple of narrow strips of\r\nsuitable fabric (Fig. 2), forming casings for drawing strings. At the\r\nopposite edges of the facing are attached small rings, through either\r\nseries of which a drawing string may be passed.\r\n\r\nThe extension piece (Fig. 1) of the protector consists of an endless\r\nband of waterproof fabric, like that of the body, provided at its\r\nedges with bindings, to which rings for drawing strings are secured.\r\nThe protector can readily be adjusted and held upon a small or medium\r\nsized hat by properly manipulating the drawing strings. To adapt the\r\nprotector to a large hat, the extension piece is united to the main\r\npiece by a string passed through the inner series of rings on the\r\nfacing and through one of the series of rings on the extension piece. A\r\nstring is then passed through the other rings of the extension piece,\r\nwhen the protector can be held to the hat by adjusting the drawing\r\nstrings. It is evident that this protector may be applied over a hat\r\nwithout danger of crushing the most delicate trimmings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOPKIRK'S PROTECTOR FOR LADIES' HATS.]\r\n\r\nThis invention has been patented by Mrs. W. H. Hopkirk, of Agency, Iowa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED STUMP PULLER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stump puller shown in the accompanying engraving (page 130) is\r\nexceedingly powerful, as, by a system of compound levers, a pull of\r\none pound on the operating bar will exert a pull of 384 pounds on the\r\nstump, and if the lifting chain be passed around a single pulley, this\r\npower is doubled. With one of these machines one man has pulled a green\r\nmaple stump two feet in diameter from clay soil. The pulling mechanism\r\nis supported by a tripod, to the upper end of which is secured a chain\r\ncarrying a bar or plate provided with a bearing in which slides a\r\nnotched bar. Meshing with the notches of this bar are the teeth of a\r\npawl, which is so connected, by levers, with the operating handle that\r\nthe downward movement of the latter will raise the pawl and notched bar\r\nand the chain attached to its lower end. A sliding bolt then holds the\r\nnotched bar in its raised position, when the handle can be raised to\r\nenable the pawl to engage with the next lower teeth of the bar. Thus,\r\nby a succession of up and down movements of the handle, the notched\r\nbar may be elevated its entire length, or until the stump is pulled\r\ncompletely out. It will be seen that the sliding bolt permits of the\r\nupward, but prevents the downward, movement of the notched bar when the\r\npawl is disengaged and slides downward. But, by means of a suitably\r\narranged hand lever, the pawl may be moved so as to be out of contact\r\nwith the bar, and, at the same time, the bolt, which is pressed forward\r\nby a spring, may be moved to disengage it from the notch in the bar,\r\nwhich may then be adjusted in any desired position. The machine is\r\nbuilt of steel and malleable iron.\r\n\r\nThis invention has been patented by Messrs. R. R. Tichenor and P.\r\nWalker, of Henning, Minn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Defense of New York within Thirty Days' Time.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea seems to prevail that the United States is absolutely helpless\r\nagainst a naval attack from England. I think this idea is entirely\r\nerroneous. There is the pneumatic gun, capable now of throwing 300 lb.\r\nof nitro-glycerine, which amount could easily be increased to 1,000\r\nlb. For the value of one modern ironclad, 150 steamers with such a gun\r\ncould be put in service in two weeks by the United States, because\r\nany steamer of 100 feet or over would answer; while the gun, being a\r\nmere tube, subjected to but 1,000 lb. of air per square inch, with\r\nair-compressing machinery, is all so available and quickly built that\r\na month would put the United States into possession of 500 of them.\r\nIf, now, 20 such steamers be told off for each ironclad sent against\r\nus, even if two-thirds were sunk, they would, before being entirely\r\ndemolished, succeed in depositing 5 to 10 tons of nitro-glycerine on\r\nthe deck of the ironclad, and exploding it.\r\n\r\nWould not the effect of repeated explosions of 1,000 lb. of\r\nnitro-glycerine blow the deck in, dismount the guns and engine, and\r\nshake the armor loose, as the explosions of the Monitors' guns did when\r\nthey were in service in the late war--the heads of bolts and other\r\nfastenings of the armor flying off from the concussion.\r\n\r\nThen there is the submarine boat, that has already stayed under\r\nwater thirty minutes with its crew, and been easily and correctly\r\nguided. What is in the way of using ten such boats to each ironclad,\r\none of which would unquestionably succeed in placing 1,000 lb. of\r\nnitro-glycerine under the ironclad, the explosion of which would be\r\nheard from? Because the explosion of 90 lb. of gun-cotton did not\r\nmaterially damage an ironclad, can it be reasoned that 1,000 lb. of\r\nnitro-glycerine, which would have twenty-five times the force of 90 lb.\r\nof gun-cotton, would be equally ineffective? Hardly, I think.\r\n\r\nNets, etc., would not prevent such boats from diving under them, while\r\nthey would only impede the speed and maneuvering of the ironclad, and\r\nrender her more easily approached.\r\n\r\nBlucher, the German cavalry officer, insisted that it was the\r\nimpression and belief existing in Germany that Napoleon was invincible,\r\nand the Germans helpless, that alone prevented them from conquering.\r\nWhen the occasion came when he could demonstrate this, the Germans and\r\nallies easily defeated and dethroned Napoleon.\r\n\r\nIt is similarly true in this country, for too many believe that the\r\nEnglish ironclad is invincible, and this impression makes cowards of\r\ntoo many. Give the nitro-glycerine gun and submarine boat a trial, if\r\noccasion arises, and England's ironclads will succumb as easily as\r\nNapoleon when sufficient power of the right kind was brought to bear on\r\nhim. The right kind of power to apply to England is nitro-glycerine and\r\ndynamite, which could be ready with guns and boats in a month or less.\r\nOne hundred days sufficed to build the first Monitor many years ago,\r\nand much less time will be needed for dynamite guns.\r\n\r\n  WAYNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElectroplating with Platinum.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlatinum has not been much used in electroplating, notwithstanding\r\nits hard, durable, and protective properties. This is, perhaps,\r\nchiefly owing to the practical difficulty of obtaining a good firm\r\n\"reguline\" deposit. A process for effecting this has, however, been\r\nbrought out recently by a Mr. Bright, whose patents have been acquired\r\nby the Bright Platinum Plating Company, and are in actual operation\r\nin London at works established there. Platinum has the advantage of\r\nkeeping its color where silver, brass, or copper becomes discolored,\r\nand will, to some extent at least, replace the use of these metals in\r\nelectrotyping. It will be highly useful in plating chemists' crucibles\r\nand so on. German silver, for example, plated with platinum can be used\r\nto manipulate strong acids. By the Bright process, platinum can be\r\ndeposited on any surface which can be electroplated with other metals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMBINED BRUSH AND COMB CLEANER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe invention herewith illustrated relates to a device for cleaning\r\nbrushes and combs. It consists of a handle or body of suitable form,\r\nprovided at one end with a brush, and at the opposite end with thin\r\ncurved fingers of metal, or equivalent elastic material, adapted to\r\nenter between the teeth of the comb or the bristles of the brush. In\r\nmaking use of the device the hooks are employed to loosen and remove,\r\nas far as possible, the hairs or other foreign matter, after which the\r\nbrush is employed to complete the operation. It is intended to afford\r\na cheap, simple, and efficient means of cleaning articles in daily\r\nuse in every household, and is virtually sure, considering the low\r\ncost at which it can be manufactured, to become a staple article of\r\nmerchandise. The invention has been patented by Mr. J. O. Brookbank,\r\nof Driftwood, Cameron County, Pa., to whom all particulars relating to\r\npurchase of rights for the United States and Canada should be addressed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BROOKBANK'S COMBINED BRUSH AND COMB CLEANER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCorrespondence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCoincidence of Charleston Earthquake with a Reported Eruption in the\r\nTonga Group.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the Scientific American:_\r\n\r\nI would like to call your attention to a reported coincidence,\r\ndescribed in a letter in the London _Times_ of December last. An\r\ninterview with captain and crew of a vessel just then arrived at\r\nSydney, Australia, from Tonga Islands, is given. The captain is\r\nrepresented assaying that while lying off the islands on the night of\r\nthe 31st of August, 1886, he observed a most terrific eruption of a\r\nvolcano situated on one of them, accompanied by earthquake shocks, and\r\nthe vessel received showers of dust and ashes. The occurrence on the\r\nsame night with the Charleston earthquake on this continent is curious,\r\nto say the least. The statement might be acceptable to those of your\r\nreaders interested in seismic disturbances.\r\n\r\n  P. MAX.

There is a bar iron mill, situated\r\nin a neighboring town four miles from here, that has been on fire\r\nthree or four times, in which the English sparrow might be called the\r\nincendiary. These sparrows pick up old pieces of cotton waste, which\r\nthey build in their nests, among the timbers of the roof of the mill,\r\nand in every case of the fires above mentioned, these nests were the\r\ncause, either from spontaneous combustion or from sparks from the hot\r\niron striking and lodging in the nest. If you could suggest some way of\r\ngetting rid of the sparrows, I think the manager of the mill would be\r\nglad to adopt your plan.\r\n\r\n  R. W.

I have scarcely ever\r\nput coal into the fire without making the observation; and there is\r\nperhaps not a lump, of size at all considerable, that does not contain\r\nthese films.\r\n\r\nOn close examination, I have frequently found that the surface of\r\nthe films on the broken lumps contains a delicate tracery, closely\r\nresembling vegetable impressions. The tracery is not so well marked as\r\na fossil imprint, but not so indistinct as to escape notice.\r\n\r\n  J. F.

My attention was called to the\r\nmatter while gigging for fish, by frequently observing dim phosphoric\r\nlights appear and disappear along the shore like jack o' lanterns,\r\nwhich I for a long time supposed them to be. Oh one occasion I fired\r\nat such a light, and brought down a large blue crane, on which the\r\nphosphoric spots were clearly visible after death. There are two such\r\nspots; the larger being high up on the breast and the smaller at the\r\nbottom of the breast bone, the bird having power to reveal and conceal\r\nthem at will. I have since stuffed many of the water walkers, and find\r\nthat all have the same general arrangement of the feathers, and, as I\r\nbelieve, the same power of lighting up the water to attract the fish.\r\nWill some naturalist who is posted on this subject please throw some\r\nfurther light upon it, for the benefit of science?\r\n\r\n  ISAAC N. WORRALL.\r\n\r\n  Topeka, Kansas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCanned Fish, Meats, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nA correspondent in British Columbia, who is engaged in the business,\r\ngives us the following practical information:\r\n\r\nNoticing your reply to a correspondent anent canned goods, I recently\r\nopened several cans of salmon that were processed in July of 1879,\r\n1880, 1881, and on comparing them with last season's cans, found it\r\nimpossible to detect the slightest difference. I hold that if a can is\r\nonce perfectly sealed, the contents will remain unaltered as long as\r\nthe metal casing remains intact.\r\n\r\nA can will keep if every portion of the contents has been subjected to\r\na temperature of 212° Fah., whether the air is expelled or not, as my\r\nexperiments have conclusively proved.\r\n\r\nWhen I first began the business, I was taught that the air unless\r\nexpelled would cause the contents to deteriorate, and that was the\r\nreason the cans were vented. I soon found it was a mistake. The venting\r\nis done for the purpose of testing for leaks. A tight can has a sound\r\nthat cannot be mistaken for a leaky one. If your correspondent boils\r\nhis fish, flesh, or fowl with the vents open, he will have dry cans\r\nfor his pains. The vents must be closed when cooking, and opened, in\r\nthe case of meats, after boiling one hour, then closed and returned to\r\nkettle, and boil three hours for fish and less for meat without bone.\r\nFruit is vented and closed when finished.\r\n\r\n  S. H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR WINTER BIRDS.\r\n\r\nBY E. M. HASBROUCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a popular belief that the woods and fields in winter time are\r\nvoid of bird life, and are what they appear at a distance--a cold,\r\nbleak, and desolate waste.\r\n\r\nThis opinion, however, is not correct. It is true that the birds, which\r\nwere so numerous during the summer, have left us and gone to their\r\nwinter homes, but as they departed an entirely different fauna started\r\nfrom a colder climate, and gradually took their place. I refer to the\r\nbirds of the northern part of Canada and the fur countries, whose\r\nsummer homes are in these desolate regions, and which on the approach\r\nof winter are driven southward, making a temporary stay with us until\r\nthe rigors of an Arctic winter shall have departed, and once more left\r\ntheir homes in an inhabitable condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA glance at these birds will take one into the same localities that\r\nhave been so often traversed in the summer time, and once within\r\nthe woods, the fact that they are cold and leafless is lost sight\r\nof. One can now find birds entirely different from any that he has\r\nheretofore seen, and at the same time learn several facts of interest\r\nconcerning birds with which he considers himself well acquainted; as,\r\nfor instance, the American goldfinch, which is supposed to migrate in\r\nthe fall, will be found in the swampy woods in large flocks, but with\r\nplumage so changed that they will probably not be recognized, being\r\nof a somber brown color, and sexes undistinguishable. Why hundreds of\r\na species, the majority of which migrate regularly, and which do not\r\nreach us until late in the spring, should change their dress and remain\r\nwith us throughout our most severe winters is a problem.\r\n\r\nIn company with them will often be found the pine linnet and common\r\nred poll. These little finches are rather rare, and are seldom found\r\ntogether in any great numbers. They leave the North in large flocks,\r\nbut as they journey southward break up into smaller and smaller\r\ncompanies, until only a few are left together. These join interests\r\nwith the nearest goldfinches, and remain with them throughout the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nThe results of a visit to the fields, on some clear day, will often\r\nrepay a somewhat wearisome tramp. The snow buntings and shore larks\r\nfrequent such places in large numbers, and a locality where the ground\r\nhas been swept bare of snow, or is covered with a growth of weeds, is a\r\nfavorite feeding ground.\r\n\r\nTheir food consists entirely of the seeds, and a spot once chosen by\r\nthem is seldom forsaken until all in this line has been eaten.\r\n\r\nThe buntings will be found in flocks of from a dozen to two hundred,\r\nand in some even more. Their appearance when flying is pure white, but\r\nthe upper parts of a specimen in the hand will be found mostly black.\r\nThey are extremely shy, and when approached spring into the air and\r\ndart away in a manner that would indicate their intention of departing\r\nfor the next county; but should you return that way in the course of\r\nhalf an hour, you will, in all probability, find them in the same place.\r\n\r\nThe shore larks, although feeding on the same grounds, seldom mix with\r\nthe buntings, preferring to keep in flocks by themselves, and are\r\nworthy of attention, inasmuch as they have one marked peculiarity; this\r\nis the small tuft of feathers on each side of the head, resembling\r\nminute horns, which are raised and lowered at pleasure. (See cut.)\r\n\r\nThe majority of these birds reach us at the approach of cold weather,\r\nalthough a few spend the summer here and rear their young. They are\r\nless timid than the snow bunting, and may often be approached quite\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nThese two species form about all the attraction to be found to any\r\nextent in the fields, and, aside from an occasional hawk, only one more\r\nspecies frequents them, a species that is worth going miles to see--the\r\nsnowy owl.\r\n\r\nThese birds reach us about the last of November and remain until the\r\nlast of February, frequenting the neighborhood of some body of water,\r\nand seldom straying from it more than a mile or two. To see them and\r\nbecome at all acquainted with their habits, one must face all kinds\r\nof weather, possess untiring energy, and must undergo a considerable\r\namount of fatigue. He will find them in the open country (as they\r\nfrequent such ground altogether, seldom, if ever, entering the woods),\r\nperched on some fence post or stump, where, if undisturbed, they will\r\nremain for a considerable length of time, intently watching for mice,\r\nof which their food largely consists, set off by an occasional rabbit.\r\nThey are extremely rare. One may tramp the fields for several days\r\nwithout success, and then again find one the first hour out.\r\n\r\nOn December 20, 1886, the writer started on a trip to Oneida Lake, N.\r\nY., intending to devote his attention entirely to these birds; was gone\r\nfour days, and saw five birds. This, of course, was exceptional, but\r\nshows what may happen.\r\n\r\nIn the dense pine and hemlock swamps several other species of owls are\r\nfound, which are much more numerous at this season than in the summer.\r\nThese are the long eared and short eared owls, with an occasional\r\nbarred owl; but the most interesting of all is the Acadian or saw-whet,\r\none of the smallest of the family and little known. It is far from\r\ncommon, being met with only at intervals. Its note, which closely\r\nresembles the filing of a large saw, occasionally betrays it; while at\r\nthe same time it has a tendency to stray into barns and out-buildings,\r\nthus affording an opportunity for capture.\r\n\r\nAs it is not generally known, a description may be of some benefit.\r\n\"Upper parts, including wings and tail, uniform chocolate-brown,\r\nspotted with white; under parts white, thickly streaked lengthwise with\r\nthe color of the back; face, white.\"\r\n\r\nIn general appearance, they are the same as all owls, but when seen in\r\nthe woods have a somewhat comical appearance, owing to their wise look\r\nfor so small a bird.\r\n\r\nWe have often heard of the shrikes, or butcher birds, that capture\r\nsmall birds and impale them on the thorns of bushes. Many of us have\r\nwished to see them, and wondered where and when they were to be found.\r\nNow is the time. Any clump of bushes or young second-growth is a likely\r\nplace to find them, for there are two species which visit us every\r\nwinter and frequent these places. These are the great northern and\r\nloggerhead shrikes, the latter being most common; both bear a general\r\nresemblance, but differ mainly in size and in markings on the under\r\nparts. One can find them almost any day, perched on the topmost branch\r\nof some tree or bush, steadily eyeing the surrounding bushes in search\r\nof some victim, while on a thornbush near by will be found numberless\r\nmoles, mice, and an occasional bird, awaiting the appetite of the\r\nmarauder.\r\n\r\nAside from the goldfinches, many other birds of different species,\r\ninstead of migrating with the rest, remain behind, and are to be found,\r\non almost any pleasant day, in the warmer and more secluded parts of\r\nthe swamp. Among these are the robin, golden-winged, downy, and hairy\r\nwoodpeckers, the white-bellied nuthatch, and chickadees. These last\r\nare, perhaps, the most numerous of all our winter birds; whole flocks\r\nroam from one end of the swamp to the other, and I think there is no\r\npleasanter sound to be heard in the woods in winter than to hear their\r\nclear \"chick-a-dee-de-de-de\" from a score of little throats, or to see\r\nthem clinging to the branches and acting as familiarly as though no one\r\nwas within sight or hearing. An occasional meadow lark will be flushed\r\nfrom the tall grass in some sheltered spot, while on the open streams\r\nwill be found black ducks and mallards, whistlers and mergansers of two\r\nspecies, the hooded and buff-breasted or common sheldrake.\r\n\r\nTruly, then, with all this material awaiting us, the fields and forests\r\nwill be found inviting, and you who have never traversed them in winter\r\ndo so now, and get a new interest awakened in them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIT is not long since we spoke of the benefits conferred on the farmer\r\nby the inventor. The following statement is a good illustration of our\r\nviews as then presented. It is taken from our contemporary, the _New\r\nEngland Farmer_. \"By the use of mowing machines and horse rakes and a\r\nhorse hay fork, two boys in Connecticut last summer cut, raked, and\r\nhelped to stow away 100 tons of hay, while their father was disabled\r\nfrom work by illness. Under such conditions a farmer is apt to feel\r\nlike blessing the man who invents labor-saving machinery.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERMOSCOPIC BALANCE.\r\n\r\nBY GEO. M. HOPKINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe action of this instrument is due to the facility with which liquids\r\nevaporate in a vacuum. A small amount of heat is sufficient to vaporize\r\nthe liquid to the extent required to secure the desired action. The\r\ninstrument is provided with a glass tube bent twice at right angles,\r\nand having a bulb blown on each end. The tube and the bulbs are partly\r\nfilled with water, and a vacuum is secured by boiling the water in the\r\nbulbs before sealing them. The center of the tube is furnished with\r\nV-pivots, which rest in bearings in the top of the forked column. The\r\ncolumn also supports a metal screen, which is bright one side and black\r\non the other. Two pins project from the shield, to limit the movements\r\nof the glass tube and bulbs.\r\n\r\nWhen the instrument is in use, the screen is placed toward the source\r\nof heat, and when radiant heat strikes the bulb which is unshielded\r\nby the screen, the water in that bulb is vaporized, and sufficient\r\npressure is produced to drive the water upward into the bulb behind\r\nthe screen. When a little more than half of the water has been in\r\nthis manner forced from the lower to the higher bulb, the upper bulb\r\npreponderates. The tube and bulbs are supported on their pivot so as\r\nto secure unstable equilibrium, so that, when the upper bulb begins to\r\ndescend, it completes its excursion at once, and exposes the full bulb\r\nto the radiant heat, at the same time carrying its empty bulb behind\r\nthe screen, where it cools. The transfer of the water from the full\r\nbulb to the empty one now occurs as before. This operation is repeated\r\nso long as the bulbs are exposed to the action of radiant heat. The\r\noscillations may be quickened by smoking the sides of the bulbs remote\r\nfrom the screen, and still greater rapidity of action may be secured\r\nby concentrating the heat on the bulbs by means of condensers or\r\nreflectors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THERMOSCOPIC BALANCE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duration of the Sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Builders' Weekly Reporter_ (London) has an interesting account\r\nof a lecture at the Royal Institute, given by Professor Sir William\r\nThomson, on the latest dynamical theories regarding the \"probable\r\norigin, total amount, and possible duration of the sun's heat.\" During\r\nthe short 3,000 years or more of which man possesses historic records\r\nthere was, the learned physicist showed, no trace of variation in solar\r\nenergy; and there was no distinct evidence of it even though the earth,\r\nas a whole, from being nearer the sun, received in January 6½ per cent\r\nmore heat than in July. But in the millions of years which geology\r\ncarried us back, it might safely be said there must have been great\r\nchanges. How had the solar fires been maintained during those ages? The\r\nscientific answer to this question was the theory of Helmholtz that the\r\nsun was a vast globe gradually cooling, but as it cooled, shrinking,\r\nand that the shrinkage--which was the effect of gravity upon its\r\nmass--kept up its temperature. The total of the sun's heat was equal to\r\nthat which would be required to keep up 476,000 millions of millions\r\nof millions horse power, or about 78,000 horse power for every square\r\nmeter--a little more than a square yard--and yet the modern dynamical\r\ntheory of heat shows that the sun's mass would require only to fall in\r\nor contract thirty-five meters per annum to keep up that tremendous\r\nenergy. At this rate, the solar radius in 2,000 years' time would be\r\nabout one hundredth per cent less than at present. A time would come\r\nwhen the temperature would fall, and it was thus inconceivable that\r\nthe sun would continue to emit heat sufficient to sustain existing\r\nlife on the globe for more than 10,000,000 years. Applying the same\r\nprinciples retrospectively, they could not suppose that the sun had\r\nexisted for more than twenty million years, no matter what might have\r\nbeen its origin--whether it came into existence from the clash of\r\nworlds pre-existing, or of diffused nebulous matter. There was a great\r\nclinging by geologists and biologists to vastly longer periods, but the\r\nphysicist, treating it as a dynamic question with calculable elements,\r\ncould come to no other conclusion materially different from what he had\r\nstated. Sir William Thomson declined to discuss any chemical source\r\nof heat, which, whatever its effect when primeval elements first came\r\ninto contact, was absolutely insignificant compared with the effects of\r\ngravity after globes like the sun and the earth had been formed. In all\r\nthese speculations they were in the end driven to the ultimate elements\r\nof matter, to the question--when they thought what became of all the\r\nsun's heat--what is the luminiferous ether that fills space, and to\r\nthat most wonderful form of force upon which Faraday spent so much of\r\nthe thought of his later years--gravity. The lecture was heard with\r\ndeep interest and close attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED MARINE DREDGER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe twin screw dredger Dolphin was recently constructed for the\r\nColonies, under the direction of Sir John Coode, assisted by Mr. Wm.\r\nMatthews, C.E., and is especially designed, says the _Engineer_, for\r\nharbor improvements in the West Indies.

The bucket ladder works through a well formed in the center of\r\nthe vessel, and dredges to a depth of 33 ft. below the water level,\r\nand the buckets are made wholly of steel, and are capable of lifting\r\n250 tons of free soil per hour. Triple-geared winches are supplied at\r\nbow and stern for working the mooring chains, the barrels of which can\r\nbe worked independently or conjointly, as required. The cabins for the\r\nofficers and crew are of the most complete description; those of the\r\nformer being fitted on starboard side of the well, and consist of rooms\r\nfor the captain, mate, and engineers, also mess room. All the rooms\r\nare large and efficiently lighted and ventilated. A powerful crane is\r\nerected at forward end for overhauling the buckets, hoisting gear, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DREDGER DOLPHIN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHydraulic Dredging at Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a recent meeting of the Engineers' Club of Philadelphia, a paper by\r\nConway B. Hunt was read on hydraulic dredging machinery.\r\n\r\nThe paper mentions the early application of the principle of hydraulic\r\ndredging, that is, the mixing of dredged material with water and then\r\nremoving the mixture by suction or otherwise; and after referring\r\nbriefly to the Roy Stone and Bowers dredges as typical machines,\r\ndescribes in detail the Von Schmidt dredge. Two of these dredges are\r\nengaged on the improvement of the Potomac River at Washington, D. C.,\r\nunder the United States Government. Each is 100 feet by 50 feet, with\r\na semicircular bow, around which travels a vertical suction pipe, 22\r\nin. in diameter, and telescopic. At its foot is a conical hood, beneath\r\nwhich works a rotary excavating plow, 8 feet in diameter. The suction\r\nis produced by a powerful centrifugal pump, run by a 200 horse power\r\nengine.\r\n\r\nThe discharge pipe is 20 in. in diameter, has rubber hose joint\r\nconnections, and is carried to the shore on pontoons. The material was\r\nmixed with from three to ten times its volume of water, and discharged\r\nat distances up to 3,500 feet from the dredge, and at from 6 to 10 feet\r\nabove water. A year's record shows an average of 175 cubic yards per\r\nworking hour, and 2,300 yards per day, for each dredge. The work was\r\ndone, by contract, at prices of 12.37 cts., 15 cts., and 15.45 cts. per\r\ncubic yard, which includes the cost of levees to confine the semi fluid\r\nmaterial, drains to carry off the water, etc. The final estimates were\r\nspecified to be taken by cross sections of the completed fill after\r\nit had become solidified and compacted. In conclusion, it is noted\r\nthat the devices and details of hydraulic dredging machines are the\r\nsubjects of numerous patents, and their most efficient combination may\r\nbe long deferred. The large number of machines that are still in the\r\nexperimental stage of development would indicate that the best results\r\nattainable from this class of dredges have not yet been accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA New Sugar Process.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe details of the process vary with quality of beets. To a vat\r\ncontaining the secondary products to be treated are added calculated\r\nquantities of diluted hydrochloric acid and milk of lime at 25° B. The\r\nmass is heated to the boiling point by a steam coil. In a separate vat\r\nthe product is diluted with water at 75° C. to 23° B., and subsequently\r\nrun through Puvrez filtering bags. The filtrate is clear in color,\r\nand is received in a measuring tank, from which it is run into the\r\ndiffusion battery. In the latter but few changes are necessary. It is\r\nsaid that by this method an additional 1 per cent sugar is extracted\r\nfrom the beet, and the white sugar obtained can be at once placed upon\r\nthe market.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHERE were exported last season from Prince Edward Island\r\n91,000 cases of lobsters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHERN LIGHTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1752, Franklin succeeded, through a kite sent up into a storm\r\ncloud, in obtaining an electric spark at the extremity of the cord,\r\nwhich had been made a conductor through the rain, it was no longer\r\npossible to doubt that lightning was but an immense electric discharge\r\nbetween two clouds, or a discharge between a cloud and the earth. This\r\ndiscovery was of great importance, since it connected with the laws of\r\nphysics certain phenomena which, until then, had passed for marvelous,\r\nand in which nothing but supernatural and mysterious manifestations\r\nwere seen.\r\n\r\nThe aurora borealis, which is more difficult to understand, and which\r\nnecessitates more extended scientific notions, has remained much\r\nlonger unexplained. This enigmatic phenomenon was especially striking\r\nto the imagination of ancient peoples. It was regarded as an omen of\r\ninauspicious events, and the historians who describe it affirm that, at\r\ntimes, armies have been seen passing through the bloody heavens, and\r\nthat the clash of arms has been heard.\r\n\r\nIt is now known that the aurora borealis has the same origin as\r\nlightning, that it is one of the visible manifestations of atmospheric\r\nelectricity, and that it is due to slow movements of that fluid, while\r\nlightning is the result of violent motions. The effects of the aurora\r\nand of the thunderbolt are absolutely different; but between them there\r\nis an intermediary that connects them, and this is heat lightning.\r\n\r\nThese elementary notions are now the property of science; but the study\r\nof the aurora has hitherto been only partially outlined. Travelers\r\nand physicists have, indeed, given numerous descriptions, but it has\r\nremained to find the bonds that unite these so important phenomena\r\nin the economy of the globe, to study the causes that set them in\r\naction, to observe the correlations that they may offer, and to discuss\r\ntheories. This is a labor that Mr. S. Lemstrom has been engaged in for\r\nseveral years, and we now propose to analyze the results published by\r\nthis great Finnish physicist.\r\n\r\nThe author of this important work, who has long been occupied in the\r\nstudy of the aurora borealis, so frequent in his country, was attached\r\nto the polar expedition made in 1868 by Nordenskjold. He was led to\r\nbegin a series of important observations. In 1871 he visited Finnish\r\nLapland, and, after a series of ingenious researches, constructed an\r\napparatus that permitted him to artificially reproduce the light of the\r\naurora, and to present science with a summary of new and incontestable\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nMr. Lemstrom has observed a large number of auroræ, and before touching\r\nupon theoretic questions, we shall give his description of one of\r\nthe phenomena that seems to him to be the completest. On the 18th of\r\nOctober, 1868, the steamer Sophia was nearing the coast of Norway,\r\nafter battling with a furious sea for three days in succession.\r\n\r\n\"To the west of the horizon we remarked two strata of clouds that were\r\nclearly separated by a blue band of the heavens, crossed by a band\r\nstriated with a pale yellow. It was the feeble beginning of an aurora,\r\nwhose splendor was soon to surpass all the phenomena of the same kind\r\nthat we had up till then observed. The edges of the upper stratum of\r\nclouds gradually lighted up, and we soon saw isolated flames issuing\r\nfrom them that sometimes rose to the zenith. Suddenly, the phenomenon\r\nembraced the entire horizon. Everywhere were flames, everywhere were\r\njets of brilliant light, yellow below, green in the center, and reddish\r\nviolet above. In an instant, all the rays united in a regular and\r\ndazzling crown, situated in the heavens to the south of the zenith.\r\nWhen the phenomenon reached the maximum of its intensity, it reminded\r\nus of the immense vault of a temple, with a brilliant chandelier in the\r\ncenter. The apparition lasted but a few minutes, but, on vanishing,\r\nleft behind it a luminous zone between the banks of clouds. From the\r\nupper bank there continued to emanate, at short intervals, isolated\r\nrays that rose to the zenith, and there formed the fragments of a\r\ncrown. The edges of the banks of clouds remained luminous, although the\r\nrays had disappeared.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--AURORAL LIGHT AROUND THE SUMMIT OF A MOUNTAIN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--AURORA BOREALIS OBSERVED IN LAPLAND. ]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--AURORA BOREALIS OBSERVED AT THE PRESBYTERY OF\r\nENARE. ]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--AURORA BOREALIS OBSERVED NEAR THE COAST OF\r\nNORWAY.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Lemstrom, Fig. 1 gives an idea, although a feeble\r\none, of the phenomenon at its height. It reproduces only half of the\r\nhorizon, and the reader may supply the missing portion of this grand\r\nspectacle in imagination. The streams of light verging toward a common\r\ncenter were alternately rose colored and pale yellow, and overlooked an\r\nimmense violet zone. The rosette in the center was of a beautiful red,\r\nand stood out upon a greenish blue circle.\r\n\r\nFig. 2 represents an aurora that was observed on the 19th of November,\r\n1871, in Finnish Lapland. At the beginning, and at 30° above the\r\nhorizon, it formed an arch from whence rose waves of light, and which\r\ngradually ascended. The figure shows it when it had reached about 60°\r\nabove the horizon. The base of the aurora was yellow, and the oblique\r\nand very brilliant rays were, slightly higher up, rosy, violet, and\r\nblue. The colors of the polar light are usually clear and bright, but\r\nnever did they exhibit greater luster than on this occasion.\r\n\r\nFig. 3 gives an idea of the variety of forms that the phenomenon may\r\naffect. It represents an aurora that was observed at the presbytery\r\nof Enare on the 16th of November, 1871. The aurora this time took on\r\nthe form of a glowing red band, curved as shown in the figure. The two\r\nextremities bordered on yellow and green.\r\n\r\nThere is another form of aurora frequently observed in northern\r\ncountries, and that is the one that is seen to occur above clouds, and\r\nthat has the appearance of a wide piece of drapery with undulating\r\nfolds. As it is the form most usually represented, we shall not dwell\r\nupon it. On the contrary, we shall speak of other phenomena of the same\r\norigin, and much less known, that Mr. Lemstrom describes. It concerns\r\nthose auroral lights that shine at the edges of clouds, or that form\r\naround the tops of the mountains in Spitzbergen or in the Alpine\r\ndistricts of Lapland. According to the Finnish observer, it would be\r\nimpossible to tell by the naked eye whence this light comes, but, by\r\nmeans of a spectroscope, we find that it is of the same nature as the\r\naurora. Sometimes, these strange lights take on the form of flames of\r\nbut little brightness, which, at short intervals, rise from the crest\r\nof the mountain and suddenly vanish (Fig. 4).\r\n\r\nThese phenomena sometimes exhibit themselves at the level of the\r\nearth's surface, or upon the roofs of houses.\r\n\r\nFinally, Mr. Lemstrom describes the diffuse light which sometimes fills\r\nthe atmosphere of the polar regions, thus proving that the phenomenon\r\nshows itself from time to time in the vicinity of the earth itself.\r\n\r\nMeteors of the same nature as the light of the auroræ boreales do not\r\noccur solely in the polar regions, and the author demonstrates, not\r\nwithout attaching much importance to it from the standpoint of the\r\ntheories to which he has been led, that they are observed in other\r\ncountries of the earth. In Peru, Bolivia, and Chili the summits of the\r\nmountains are often seen illuminated by a brilliant light. This light,\r\nwhich occurs especially in summer, has been compared to heat lightning\r\nby scientists.\r\n\r\nSimilar observations have been made in the Swiss Alps. Dr. De Saussure\r\nhas seen electricity escape through all the projecting parts of\r\nobjects, and the same phenomena have been observed upon the high\r\nplateaus of Mexico. Again, we may cite the fact that Brewster observed\r\na light upon a church tower during an aurora borealis. In every country\r\nphenomena similar to polarized light may occur.--_La Nature_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN 1886, 17 Gloucester fishing vessels were lost, worth\r\n$115,800, and 115 fishermen never came home. The year was remarkable\r\nfor the small inshore catch, almost all the fishing being done on the\r\nhigh seas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Latest Yankee Craze.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the forthcoming American Exhibition in London, we are promised,\r\namong other novelties, a house of straw, which is now being made\r\nin Philadelphia. This house is to represent an American suburban\r\nvilla, announced to be \"handsome and artistic in design,\" two and a\r\nhalf stories high, and covering a space of 42 feet by 50 feet. It is\r\nconstructed entirely of materials manufactured from straw--foundations,\r\ntimbers, flooring, sheathing, roofing, everything in fact, including\r\nthe chimneys--the material being fire proof as well as water proof. The\r\ninside finish is to be in imitation rosewood, mahogany, walnut, maple,\r\nash, ebony, and other fine woods, the straw lumber taking perfectly\r\nthe surface and color of any desired wood. This straw house is, in\r\nthe first place, to illustrate Philadelphia's commercial, financial,\r\nand industrial interests by means of large photographs of the leading\r\nbuildings; but it will also demonstrate how far the inventive Yankee\r\nhas succeeded, not in showing us how to make bricks without straw, but\r\nhow to produce timber from straw. If, after this brilliant exhibition\r\nof inventive genius, we do not bow down and worship him as the \"licker\"\r\nof creation, we may consider ourselves lost to all sense of what is\r\nproper under the circumstances.--_Iron._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF A TORPEDO ON AN IRONCLAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe British government lately strengthened up the bottom of the old\r\nironclad Resistance, and tried the effect of firing off a 90 lb.\r\nguncotton torpedo against the vessel. To the surprise of every one,\r\nthe ship was not seriously damaged. The _Engineer_ comments upon the\r\nexperiment as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Resistance experiments so far tend to demonstrate that the total\r\ndisablement or destruction of a modern ironclad is not so easy as\r\nmany people imagined. It was too hastily assumed that the explosion\r\nof a charge of 90 lb. of guncotton in contact with any portion of the\r\nhull under water would have such destructive effect as to overcome\r\nthe protection afforded by a thick lining of coal and the cellular\r\nsystem of construction now always adopted in vessels of war. There\r\nare, however, certain considerations attached to this experiment\r\nwhich, if duly weighed, should reassure the advocates of the torpedo,\r\nand restrain the exultation of naval architects within reasonable\r\nbounds. We shall endeavor to place these before our readers briefly\r\nand impartially, reserving a fuller summing-up until the remaining\r\nexperiments are concluded, as they are of greater importance than any\r\nof those preceding. It is the more essential to do this because the\r\n_Times_, in a leading article of November 3, leads us to believe that\r\nas this attack failed, in the broad sense of the word, similar attempts\r\nunder different conditions would have a like result: and that although\r\nserious damage would be caused, the ship would remain \"floating and\r\nseaworthy, with her offensive powers not materially impaired.\" We are\r\nnot prepared to accept this conclusion, for the following reasons:\r\n\r\nFirst, let us consider the general effect of a submarine explosion. It\r\nclosely resembles the action of gunpowder when ignited in a gun. We\r\nknow that in the latter case a quantity of heated gas is formed, which\r\nin its power of expansion exerts force in all directions. Prevented\r\nfrom expanding by its rigid confinement, except in the direction\r\nof the bore, the gas attains its object by the displacement of the\r\nprojectile. This is, in fact, the line of least resistance. When the\r\nsame explosive is ignited under water, the heated gas presses outward\r\nin all directions, forcing the surrounding molecules of water against\r\ntheir neighbors, which are, in turn, propelled forward with great\r\nviolence. This effect continues until the back pressure of the liquid\r\nmedium equals the now reduced pressure of the gas due to its expansion\r\nin the space vacated by the displaced water, which is likewise to some\r\nextent compressed by the action of the gas. Though brought actually\r\nto a state of rest, the surrounding water is under the influence of\r\ngreat pressure, which by the law of fluids is transmitted equally in\r\nall directions. When a vessel is sufficiently near the explosion to be\r\nstruck by the water which has been so violently disturbed, it will act\r\nupon her like a huge projectile, and it is obvious this range will be\r\nin proportion to the amount of explosive employed. This, combined with\r\nthe resistance her hull offers, will also determine the effect produced.\r\n\r\nIf the charge is too near the surface of the water, the liquid layer\r\nabove it will not restrain the liberated gas sufficiently to allow of\r\nits full power being exerted in other directions, and hence permits\r\nits escape into the atmosphere, throwing up the water in its way to a\r\ngreater or less height, according to the thickness of the layer. The\r\nspectacular effect, therefore, afforded by the upheaval of a large and\r\nlofty column of water is no criterion of the efficiency of a submarine\r\nexplosion, but, on the contrary, shows that much of its energy has\r\nbeen expended in the wrong direction. The amount of submersion to give\r\nthe greatest lateral effect to different charges of explosive has been\r\nascertained by practical experiments. For 100 lb. of gunpowder, it\r\nis stated to be 10 ft., while for the same quantity of guncotton it\r\nshould be 15 ft. As the charge employed against the Resistance was 90\r\nlb. of guncotton placed 10 ft. below the surface, it is probable that\r\nsome loss of power was sustained in the manner we have indicated. At a\r\ngreater depth also the charge would have been to some extent under the\r\nvessel, where its explosive effect would have been more severe, and\r\nwhere the construction of the hull cannot be as strongly fortified with\r\ncoal as was the case in the Resistance. We are unable to state why a\r\ndepth of 10 ft. was selected on this occasion; but it may be due to the\r\nfact that up to a late date most of our locomotive torpedoes have not\r\ncarried a larger charge than 40 lb. of guncotton, and are usually run\r\nat 10 ft. below the surface.\r\n\r\nConsiderable stress has been laid on the fact that in this experiment\r\nthe charge was in actual contact, and yet did not effect complete\r\npenetration. It is even gravely asserted that an actual torpedo would\r\nhave rebounded a certain distance before explosion took place, and\r\nthis would diminish its effect. In the first place, the detonation of\r\nguncotton is practically instantaneous, so that impact and explosion\r\nwould be simultaneous. We are hardly prepared to allow an inch rebound,\r\nbut will concede that until actual proof convicts us of error. In\r\nthe second place, it is possible that a distance of three or four\r\nfeet between charge and ship would rather augment than diminish the\r\neffect produced in the case of such an explosive as guncotton when\r\nsufficiently immersed. It is possible the intervening water thrown\r\nagainst the side of the ship would do more damage than the gas\r\nliberated in actual contact. At any rate, experiments some years ago\r\nwith smaller quantities of both dynamite and guncotton showed that when\r\nexploded 4 ft. from the bottom of a ship, enormous damage was inflicted\r\non her.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is generally estimated that guncotton is about four times\r\nmore powerful than gunpowder, this does not appear to hold good under\r\nall conditions; while, on the other hand, for certain purposes, ten\r\ntimes the amount of gunpowder would not produce the same result. This\r\nis proved by the ease with which the strongest chain cable and wire\r\nrope can be ruptured by a small charge of guncotton, which even more\r\nthan ten times the amount of gunpowder could not accomplish. This is\r\ndue to the peculiar shattering action of detonated guncotton, which the\r\nslower burning substances does not possess, its characteristic being\r\nmore of the nature of a push than a blow. Taking into consideration the\r\nmethod in which the hull of the Resistance had been strengthened for\r\nthis experiment, and the exact locality chosen for the explosion, it is\r\nprobable that less than twice the amount of gunpowder would have caused\r\na more complete breach through the coal protection. The torpedo is\r\nstated to have had everything in its favor; whereas, in our opinion,\r\nall the advantages were on the side of the ship. The attack was made\r\nat her strongest point, where the coal was specially disposed, and her\r\nshape under water lent no assistance to the explosive. To assume from\r\nthis that if a similar torpedo struck lower down, or further aft, or\r\nagainst the propeller, the ship would still have \"her offensive powers\r\nnot materially impaired,\" is to express an opinion with which few will\r\nbe found to concur.\r\n\r\nUnder the alternative circumstances mentioned, half the amount of\r\nexplosive might practically disable the vessel, though her flotation\r\nneed not be overcome. Whitehead torpedoes need not necessarily be\r\nlimited to a depth of 10 ft., as by slightly strengthening their\r\nconstruction they could be run 20 ft. below the surface. We presume\r\nit will be allowed that this would increase their destructive power,\r\nespecially in the vicinity of engines and boilers, which now occupy so\r\nmuch space. In a similar manner there is no difficulty in increasing\r\nthe charge of a locomotive torpedo to a point at which it becomes\r\nirresistible, whatever system of internal protection may be devised.\r\nThis has, in fact, been going on for some time; more than one nation\r\npossesses torpedoes armed with 100 lb. of guncotton, and if we do not,\r\nit is simply because former experiments led us to believe sufficient\r\ndamage would be caused by a less quantity. We can only consider that\r\ndisproved on demonstration by further trials under conditions less\r\nfavorable to the ship, and we venture to predict some delusions will\r\nthen be dispelled which this particular experiment seems to have\r\noccasioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TORPEDO EXPERIMENTS AT PORTSMOUTH--DAMAGE DONE TO THE\r\nPORT SIDE OF H.M.S. RESISTANCE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteel Wire Brush Patent.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore Judges McKennan and Acheson of the United States Circuit Court\r\nfor the Western District of Pennsylvania, at Pittsburg, Pa., No. 16\r\nof November term, 1886, a question arose as to whether a steel wire\r\nbrush for cleaning castings, and a steel wire brush for cleaning\r\nboiler flues, was an infringement on what is generally known as the\r\nWright patent, No. 59,733, and the reissue, No. 2,598, owned by Joseph\r\nMcArthur, of New York city.\r\n\r\nThe Wright patent consists of a wooden block with a series of pairs of\r\nholes. A bundle of wire splints is doubled and the ends inserted in\r\nthe holes, being held by the wooden bridge between the holes and by a\r\nwooden back screwed to the block.\r\n\r\nJoseph H. Davis, of Sewickley, Pa., the defendant, under his casting\r\nbrush patent, No. 232,600, the construction of which consists in the\r\ndoubling of the wire splints and inserting in one hole of a wooden\r\nblock, and fastening by means of weaving a wire through the loop,\r\nthe wire being held in place by a wooden back fastened on by driving\r\nwrought iron nails through the block and back and clinching on the\r\nback, thus making the block and back practically inseparable.\r\n\r\nThe Davis flue brush patent, No. 181,416, is made by sticking the wire\r\nsplints through holes in an iron cylinder, there being no wood about\r\nits construction.\r\n\r\nSeveral cases had been tried in other States involving the validity\r\nof the Wright patent, which had resulted in Mr. McArthur's favor, but\r\nafter exhaustive argument in the case at Pittsburg, Pa., the court held\r\nthe Davis brush not to be an infringement on the Wright patent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Long Should a Nervous Patient be Treated?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of how long treatment should be continued in a neurotic\r\ncase when no evident benefit is produced has recently been raised\r\nin a Hamburg law court. A medical man, says the _Lancet_, having as\r\na patient a merchant suffering from \"nervousness,\" treated him by\r\ngalvanism. Altogether he galvanized him 445 times, but the nervousness\r\ndid not disappear. Then came the matter of fees. The sum claimed was\r\n$556. The merchant disputed this on the ground that the treatment ought\r\nnot have been continued so long, as it was not producing any benefit.\r\nThe court referred the matter to the medical board, which gave as its\r\nopinion that the doctor ought to have asked the patient, after some\r\nfifty sittings, whether he would like to continue them, as it was\r\ndoubtful whether the treatment was doing any good. The court, however,\r\ndeclined to accept this view, holding that it was for the patient to\r\nsay when he had tried the treatment as long as he was disposed to\r\npay for it, and so gave judgment for the full amount claimed. This\r\njudgment seems to accord with the principle that applies to newspaper\r\nsubscriptions. A man must pay for his paper as long as he takes it from\r\nthe post office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTORPEDO BOAT ARMED WITH PNEUMATIC DYNAMITE GUNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn former issues of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN we have given\r\nillustrations and detailed descriptions of the pneumatic dynamite gun\r\ninvented by Lieutenant E. L. Zalinski, of the U. S. Artillery Corps.\r\nThis gun, it will be remembered, was designed to throw a projectile\r\nloaded with dynamite or nitro-glycerine by means of compressed air;\r\nand so successful were the experiments carried on with it at Fort\r\nLafayette, under the supervision of a board of naval experts, that\r\nCongress eventually appropriated $350,000 for building a swift torpedo\r\nboat, large enough to go to sea, and to be armed with three of these\r\nguns. Contracts for this boat have been signed with the Cramps.\r\n\r\nThe upper view in the accompanying engraving is a longitudinal vertical\r\nsection, the lower one being a plan view. The following details\r\nregarding the boat we take from the _Sun_. The boat will be 250 ft.\r\nlong, 26 ft. beam, and will draw 8 ft. of water. Her displacement will\r\nbe about 800 tons. The engines will be of the triple expansion type, of\r\nthe best known design, and the guaranteed power will be 3,200. She will\r\nbe propelled by twin screws, and it is expected that the guaranteed\r\nspeed of 20 knots an hour will be exceeded.\r\n\r\nThe three dynamite guns are to be placed side by side, at the elevation\r\nindicated in the upper view. They are to be fired in their places, but\r\ntheir range can be varied by increasing or diminishing the charge of\r\nair let in behind the projectile. An extreme range of one mile is put\r\ndown in the contract, and the weight of gelatine to be thrown is 200\r\npounds; but the guns, as now building, will throw 400 pounds instead of\r\n200 pounds, and the effective range will probably be about two miles.\r\nAir chambers and compressors of sufficient size and power are provided\r\nto enable fifteen shots to be fired to the distance of one mile without\r\nstopping; but if the boat were heading for the enemy at full speed,\r\nthirty shells could be thrown before the air would be exhausted and the\r\ncruiser obliged to turn tail. Thirty shells would mean the explosion of\r\n12,000 pounds of nitro-glycerine about the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn fixing the gun permanently in its place, the designer has followed\r\nout the old idea of making the ship simply a floating gun carriage. The\r\nnew British cruiser Polyphemus is built on the same idea, and there are\r\nother floating gun carriages. In this cruiser the firing is entirely\r\nunder the control of the officer in the pilot house. He has simply to\r\nhead his boat for the enemy, dash ahead at full speed, and blaze away.\r\nThe trained pilot, even in the excitement of battle, would steer his\r\nship instinctively, so there would be little trouble with the aim,\r\nexcept, perhaps, in getting the range.\r\n\r\nEach gun can be fired once in two minutes, or the three successively in\r\ntwo minutes.\r\n\r\nThe new cruiser has a freeboard of about four feet above water. This\r\nis quite enough to enable her to travel anywhere along the coast. She\r\ncarries enough coal to travel 5,000 miles at 12 knots an hour. This\r\nwould take her about 700 miles at full speed. She could probably turn\r\na complete circle of a radius of twice her length in between two and\r\nthree minutes. She can carry 100 or even a much greater number of\r\ntorpedoes with her when going on a cruise. To show how she compares\r\nwith the best of the latest English built torpedo boats, it may be said\r\nthat the Destructor, built for the Spanish Government, carries but ten\r\ntorpedoes, although she has five tubes to fire them from, and this\r\nis the usual number carried. The range of the best of these foreign\r\ntorpedoes is 600 yards, under the most favorable circumstances, and in\r\na seaway not more than 100 or 200 yards. The exploding charge is 75\r\npounds of gun-cotton, an explosive that is exceedingly inefficient when\r\ncompared with nitro-glycerine.\r\n\r\nThe new boat will also be armed with the usual rapid-firing guns which\r\nare placed on foreign torpedo boats. These are to be used in battle\r\nwith craft like herself and small boats. It is expected that she will\r\nbe finished in six months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TORPEDO BOAT ARMED WITH PNEUMATIC DYNAMITE GUNS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Strength of Snails.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerceiving a common snail, _Helix aspersa_, crawling up the window\r\nblind one evening, it occurred to me to try what it could draw up\r\nperpendicularly. Accordingly, I attached to its shell four reels of\r\ncotton, fastening one after the other until I ascertained that a\r\ngreater load would exceed the limit of its strength. I then weighed\r\nthe entire load, and found that it weighed 2¼ ounces, while the snail\r\nweighed only ¼ ounce. Thus it was able to lift perpendicularly nine\r\ntimes its weight. I then made an experiment with a larger snail,\r\nweighing one-third ounce, the load being composed chiefly of the same\r\nmaterial as the last, but so placed as to be drawn in a horizontal\r\nposition on the table. Reels of cotton to the number of twelve were\r\nfastened to it, with a pair of scissors, a screw driver, a key, and a\r\nknife, weighing altogether seventeen ounces, or fifty times the weight\r\nof the snail. The same snail when placed on the ceiling was able to\r\ntravel with a weight of four ounces suspended from its shell. I next\r\ntried it on a piece of common thread, suspended and hanging loose with\r\nanother snail of its own weight, which it carried up the thread with\r\napparent ease. After this I tried it on a single horsehair strained in\r\na horizontal position, but it had then enough to do to crawl over this\r\nnarrow bridge without a load.--_E. Sandford, in Zoologist_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEVREUL'S BLACK.\r\n\r\nT. O'CONOR SLOANE, PH.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe production of absolute black by a pigment or surface coloration has\r\nbeen shown by Chevreul to be an impossibility. No substance is known\r\nthat does not possess the power of reflecting light to some extent.\r\nIf paper is blackened, its surface will reflect rays that can act\r\npowerfully upon the sensitive plate in a camera, even if the eye, by\r\nconvention and association, would determine it to be actually black.\r\nThe same is to be said of black silk and velvet. The latter, more than\r\nany other substance, approaches real black. It is an object of common\r\nobservation that all colors show much more strongly in velvet than in\r\nany other material. The reason for this is that, owing to the depth of\r\nthe pile, the light undergoes multiple reflection. The percentage of\r\nwhite light is diminished with each reflection, and the colored rays\r\nbecome less and less contaminated with those of other hues. The same\r\nreasoning applies to black velvet. The light by multiple reflection\r\nfrom its substance is more and more absorbed, and the familiar intense\r\nblack is the result. A piece of this material, placed upon cloth or\r\nsilk, always appears, and is, the blacker. In choosing velvet for such\r\nexperiments, care must be taken not to use a blue black. The dead black\r\nis the proper one to select.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHEVREUL'S BLACK.]\r\n\r\nBlack being the absence of color is producible by excluding light. The\r\nproduction of the velvet black, we have seen, depends on the mechanical\r\ntexture of the goods. Nothing is so black as a perfectly dark room.\r\nCarrying out these principles, Chevreul devised the wonderfully\r\ningenious way of producing a true black which we illustrate.\r\n\r\nHe lined the interior of a box with black. Pigment, black silk, or\r\nblack velvet may be used. In the cover of the box he made a hole, not\r\ntoo large, but bearing a certain ratio to the area of the cover. The\r\nsize should not exceed one-tenth this surface. The spot thus produced\r\nreflected no light, as there was no surface. The interior of the box,\r\nby color and shadow, was prevented from reflecting any light, so\r\nthat absolute blackness resulted. The blackest velvet or silk placed\r\nalongside of this spot appears lighter in color.\r\n\r\nIn constructing the apparatus illustrated, a famous proverb was\r\nselected as a theme, in which a certain personage is stated not to be\r\nso black as he is painted. The author of \"English as She is Spoke\"\r\nrenders this proverb, \"He not so devil as he is black.\" The blackness\r\nof this image is absolute.\r\n\r\nA pasteboard box is lined with black silk or velvet, and any desired\r\nfigure is cut through the cover. This may then be painted as black as\r\npossible, or before the figure is cut out, silk or velvet may be pasted\r\nover it, and the figure cut through pasteboard and covering together.\r\n\r\nThen, on putting the cover in place, holding the box so that a side\r\nlight will fall upon it, thus preventing direct access of light rays\r\nto the interior, the figure will stand out strongly black against a\r\nbackground which, but for the contrast, would itself be pronounced\r\nabsolutely black.\r\n\r\nTo apply the most rigorous test, a member of the Society of Amateur\r\nPhotographers of New York made a photograph of such a box. A carbon B\r\ndry plate was used, with thirty-five minutes' exposure, with stop f-30.\r\nThe result was a negative perfectly transparent where the figure came,\r\nbut strongly affected by the black box cover. Part of the cover was\r\ncoated with black silk and part was painted, but both reflected light\r\nenough to produce a full photograph upon the plate.\r\n\r\nA most interesting application of this principle on the large scale has\r\nbeen made of late years, especially by E. J. Marey, in the photography\r\nof moving animals.[2] With Chevreul's black as a screen, a plate can be\r\nexposed unaffected by the background, and will reproduce objects moving\r\nacross the space with perfect fidelity.\r\n\r\n[2] See SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT, Nos. 579 and 580, for fully\r\nillustrated article on this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American Exhibition, London.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecently we had an opportunity of going over the grounds of the\r\nforthcoming American Exhibition at Earls Court. The site is comprised\r\nin the triangle between Earls Court, West Brompton, and West Kensington\r\nstations, and is thus extremely well situated for easy access from all\r\nparts of London. The area that will be covered by the exhibition is\r\nabout twenty-three acres, eight of which are on one and fifteen on the\r\nother side of the West London line, an iron bridge over the railway\r\nconnecting the two portions. Although the work has been going on for\r\nsome time, little is as yet seen of any building, the operations up\r\nto the present having been confined mostly to earth works, leveling,\r\nand draining. The land to be occupied by the exhibition might almost\r\nbe called virgin soil, and all the drains had to be put in by the\r\ncompany. A good deal of soil has been moved, and some artificial mounds\r\nof considerable extent have been thrown up. In that portion of the\r\nexhibition which will be illustrative of the \"Wild West,\" a large arena\r\nand a grand stand capable of seating 25,000 persons are in course of\r\nconstruction. The feature of special interest to engineers is, however,\r\non the other side of the grounds, where the main building for the\r\nreception of the machinery and other exhibits is now being erected.\r\nThe main hall has a frontage of brickwork 240 feet long, but the rest\r\nwill all be constructed of iron and glass. The total length of this\r\nhall is 1,200 feet, and a special feature in its construction is the\r\nemployment of old steel rails for the columns, purlins, and rafters,\r\non a plan devised by Mr. H. G. Wynne, the engineer to the company. The\r\nwhole of the framework is thus made out of old rails, the only portions\r\nspecially made for the purpose being the cast iron sockets for the\r\ncolumns, cast steel shoes for the connections between purlins, rafters,\r\nand columns, and tie bars, which are made of ordinary round iron.\r\nThere will be six bays of 30 feet each, and one bay of 60 feet. The\r\ncolumns are formed by two rails, riveted together with their flanges,\r\nso as to present a cross in transverse section. These are placed into\r\ncast iron sockets, which are set upon cement piers sunk in the ground.\r\nThe outermost columns for the first and last spans are provided with\r\nstruts, also formed out of rails, fixed to a sleeper, connecting\r\nthe bottom of the strut with the foot of the column, this provision\r\nbeing made to provide against lateral strains; but the columns of the\r\nintermediate spans have no struts. The rafters are also made of rails,\r\nplaced with the flanges uppermost, those for the short spans being in\r\none length, but those for the long spans being fastened together by\r\nfish plates. The usual length of rail employed for the columns is 18\r\nfeet and 24 feet. There is a fall in the ground of about 2 feet to\r\nboth sides from the middle of the building. To avoid the necessity\r\nof employing columns of different lengths, the ridge of the roof is\r\ncarried parallel to the ground, and will therefore also show a fall\r\nof 2 feet on each side of the middle. This will be hidden by a loose\r\nlouver, which is placed all along the ridge, so that the outline of the\r\nroof will appear straight and horizontal. The sides of the building\r\nwill be of galvanized corrugated iron.--_Industries_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPETROLEUM IN EGYPT.--At Jemsah, in Egypt, in boring for\r\npetroleum, ozokerite, or solid petroleum, has been found at a depth of\r\n365 feet, and 15 feet lower a close grained coral has been struck. At\r\nanother boring, slight traces of gas and oil have also been found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGINEERING INVENTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA spark arrester has been patented by Mr. John C. Albrecht, of\r\nColumbus, Ga. Combined with a draught pipe is a cone with curved\r\nvolutes, and in its center and underneath it an inverted cone, with\r\nspark pockets, and other novel features, the sparks being returned to\r\nthe fire box, the invention being an improvement on two former patented\r\ninventions of the same inventor.\r\n\r\nA steam condenser has been patented by Mr. John McIntyre, of New York\r\nCity. It is cylindrical in form, a central perforated or slotted casing\r\nbeing used in connection with the cooling pipes, with a regulating\r\nvalve to open or close the perforations or slots, in such way that the\r\ncooling effect will be more instant and the temperature of the cooling\r\nparts more equal than in ordinary condensers.\r\n\r\nA car coupling has been patented by Mr. George W. Giles, of Buffalo,\r\nWest Va. In connection with a suitable drawhead, a weight and pin\r\nare joined by a flexible connection, the weight being adapted to\r\noverbalance the pin, and the weight being projected into the path of\r\nthe drawbar, so that the entering drawbar will raise the weight, and\r\nthus permit the pin to fall by its own gravity into coupled position.\r\n\r\nA car coupling has been patented by Mr. Wesley E. Roberts, of Hartford,\r\nKy. The coupling link consists of a straight bar, with a wedge shaped\r\npointed lug at each end, a spring being fastened to the under side,\r\nand the coupling being effected by an arm dropping in front of the\r\nlug after the link enters the drawhead, the device being simple in\r\nconstruction, and one which can be operated from the side or top of the\r\ncar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL INVENTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA mower has been patented by Messrs. James B. Nieth and Charles\r\nL. Thomas, of Independence, Iowa. This invention covers a novel\r\nconstruction and combination of various parts of the machine, so that\r\nit will operate with less friction than ordinary mowers, while being\r\nsimple in construction and not liable to get out of order.\r\n\r\nA plow has been patented by Mr. Thomas J. Eriom, of Union Church,\r\nMiss. It is an improved garden plow, with simple means for adjusting\r\nthe gauge wheel to regulate the depth of working, and a breast bar for\r\npressure by the operator to increase the propelling power and to give\r\nthe plowman a better control of the plow, with other novel features.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS INVENTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn attachment for elevator doors has been patented by Mr. Edward P.\r\nWalker, of Kansas City, Mo. It is an attachment designed to effect by\r\nthe movement of the elevator car the automatic operation of the doors\r\nof the shafts, so that the elevator man is relieved of this duty.\r\n\r\nA saw gummer has been patented by Mr. Eli Rogers, of Fulton County,\r\nInd. The invention consists of a cam lever operating a spring arm on\r\nwhich is pivoted a tool holder, making a device which is simple in\r\nconstruction, durable, and effective in operation.\r\n\r\nA hame has been patented by Mr. John E. James, of Mossy Creek, Va. It\r\nis so made that the shoulder of the horse will not be affected by heavy\r\njars, and the hames may not only be fitted to any length of collar,\r\nbut the point of draught may be shifted, so that the draught will be\r\nbrought to the proper point.\r\n\r\nA tongue support has been patented by Messrs. Charles W. Van de Mark\r\nand Calvin Moore, of Clyde, Kansas. The construction is such that the\r\ntongue may be supported so as to relieve the team of its weight, and\r\nthe devices for supporting it are simple, inexpensive, and not likely\r\nto get out of order.\r\n\r\nA fence post has been patented by Mr. John J. Kimball, of Naperville,\r\nIll. Combined with side strips are rivets, spacing strips arranged\r\nbetween the side strips, clips formed with apertures, and staples\r\narranged to pass through the apertures, making a cheap, durable, and\r\nefficient post for barbed wire fences.\r\n\r\nA combined chair and lounge has been patented by Mr. Gustavus Hamel, of\r\nDe Soto, Mo. The parts are so arranged that the back of the chair may\r\nbe adjusted to any angle desired, and the attachment constituting the\r\nfoot rest or foot of the lounge may be disposed beneath the main seat\r\nof the chair when not in use.\r\n\r\nA harmonic keyboard for violins has been patented by Mr. James F.\r\nPoage, of La Plata, Mo. It is designed to enable the performer to\r\nproduce harmonic high tones without great difficulty, and is attached\r\nto the neck of violins of the usual construction, the keyboard being a\r\ncombination of pivoted finger keys with a pivoted stop plate.\r\n\r\nA rein holder has been patented by Mr. William Tennison, of Mount\r\nVernon, Ind. This invention covers an improvement in rein holders\r\nconsisting of a skeleton frame adapted for attachment to a harness or\r\nfor support upon a horse's back, and used for the purpose of supporting\r\nthe reins out of the way of the animal's tail.\r\n\r\nA collar button has been patented by Mr. Leopold Baer, of San\r\nFrancisco, Cal. To the center of the button back is secured a tubular\r\nshank in which is a spiral spring, there being a knuckle joint by which\r\na tongue may be held in three different positions, the device making a\r\nconveniently working button for holding the necktie in place.\r\n\r\nA bridle has been patented by Mr. Benjamin S. Seaman, of Corning, N.\r\nY. The cheek plate is formed with studs on which the blind sheet is\r\nadapted to be placed, and secured by a key plate constructed to engage\r\nwith the studs, the cheek loop being secured to the cheek plate with\r\nthe same stud plate and key plate which hold the blind.\r\n\r\nA machine for bending carriage thills has been patented by Mr. Thomas\r\nE. Montague, of West Lorne, Ont., Canada. It is for bending wooden\r\nshafts or thills for buggies, sulkies, carriages, and other vehicles,\r\nand covers a novel construction and combination of parts and details,\r\nwhereby thills of greater or less thickness can be bent, the machine\r\noperating very rapidly and automatically.\r\n\r\nA nut lock has been patented by Mr. Jeremiah C. Butler, of Lexington,\r\nMo. The construction is such that the key may be drawn off the bolt by\r\nthe nut, and need not be bent out straight into the keyway of the bolt\r\nto prevent its locking portion engaging in the recesses of the nut as\r\nthe latter is being turned off the bolt, the key needing only to be\r\nbent very slightly for adjustment into locked or unlocked position.\r\n\r\nA trousers stretcher has been patented by Mr. Charles E. Ray, of San\r\nFrancisco, Cal. The trousers are clamped below the waist band and at\r\nthe bottom, the clamp at the waist band attached to a spiral or rubber\r\nspring, secured in fixed position at one end, while to the clamp at\r\nthe bottom is attached a strap by which tension can be placed upon the\r\ntrousers, and permanently maintained.\r\n\r\nA log dog has been patented by Mr. Eugene H. Allman, of Mobile, Ala. It\r\nis made of heavy wrought iron, with a flat body portion, and having end\r\npoints or fangs, and is applied to the chain by shouldered clips, all\r\nextra chains and dogs being dispensed with by its use, and when used on\r\nendless chains it being only necessary to point the logs in the logway,\r\nwhen the dogs take hold and bring them up.\r\n\r\nAn electrical weighing scale has been patented by Mr. Willis M. Hunt,\r\nof Glen Gardner, N. J. Combined with feeding hoppers arranged above the\r\nscale pan are valves operated by connection with the foot lever for\r\ndischarging the hoppers, and combined therewith is an electro-magnetic\r\nholding and releasing device, which automatically stops the feed when\r\nthe scale beam is tipped.\r\n\r\nA boot or shoe stretcher has been patented by Mr. Lloyd Nottingham, of\r\nNorfolk, Va. Centrally pivoted levers have apertures in their lower end\r\nto receive pins with rounded outer ends, and above the pivotal point\r\nis an adjusting screw to separate the levers in stretching the boot or\r\nshoe, the levers being held apart by locking pieces, the device being\r\nsimple, strong, and easily operated.\r\n\r\nA combined bench and ironing table has been patented by Mr. Daniel\r\nH. Weller, of Boyertown, Pa. Combined with a reversible board with\r\ncovered socket boxes are supports hinged to the legs of a bench, with\r\nother details, to make a desirable piece of furniture to serve the two\r\npurposes of a seat and a table to iron upon, with compartments for\r\nkeeping the cloths used in ironing.\r\n\r\nA window frame and sash has been patented by Mr. John E. Jones, of New\r\nYork City. The construction is such that the sashes when closed are to\r\nall intents and purposes air tight, and wear and friction are removed\r\nfrom the packing strips, so the sashes may be raised and lowered\r\nwithout injury to the packing, the invention being an improvement on a\r\nformer patented invention of the same inventor.\r\n\r\nA tug fastener has been patented by Mr. Daniel T. Chambers, of\r\nMansfield, Ohio. It is in the nature of a divided button, one portion\r\nintegral with a shank that goes in the end of the single tree, and the\r\nother formed of two limbs, one completing the periphery of the button\r\nand the other extending up parallel with the shank and forming a part\r\nof the neck beside the button on which the trace is contained.\r\n\r\nA tug fastener for single trees has also been patented by the above\r\ninventor. It consists of a tilting latch hinged upon a horizontal axis\r\nat or near the end of the single tree, with one hub adapted to lie\r\nlongitudinally with the single tree and the other to project upwardly\r\nat about a right angle thereto, making an easily operated device for\r\nfastening the traces to a single tree.\r\n\r\nA plaster fastener has been patented by Messrs. Forest M. Lampson,\r\nAlpheus M. Laning, and George W. Hogben, of Ripon, Wis. It consists\r\nof a metallic washer formed of thin sheet metal, slightly convex,\r\nand provided with a countersink in the center, formed by the process\r\nof stamping, the device being intended to secure plastering loosened\r\nby shrinking of the lath, etc., before it becomes cracked and\r\ndisintegrated.\r\n\r\nA combined towel, hat and paper rack has been patented by Mr. Elbridge\r\nL. Scribner, of Amesbury, Mass. (P. O. Box 98). It is a simple,\r\ninexpensive, and efficient device, consisting of a frame formed of end\r\npieces of wood, connected by wooden slats on the back, and supporting\r\nthree rods of metal or wood for receiving the articles to be held, the\r\nlower rod being designed for receiving a roller towel, and the upper\r\nrod being offset or cranked for convenience in placing articles on the\r\nlower rods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW BOOKS AND PUBLICATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINERAL RESOURCES OF THE UNITED STATES, CALENDAR YEAR 1885.\r\nWashington: Government Printing Office, 1886. Pp. 576.\r\n\r\nThis is a carefully compiled volume, giving the statistics for mineral\r\nproducts in the United States. Coal, coke, petroleum, and natural gas\r\nare first treated of; the metals, from iron to zirconium, come next.\r\nUnder aluminum the work of Col. Frishmuth, of Philadelphia, and of\r\nthe Cowles Smelting Company, of Cleveland, are noted. In view of the\r\ndemand for zirconium pencils for the oxyhydrogen light, the section\r\non the sources and preparation of the oxide, by Mr. David T. Ray, is\r\nof special interest. Other subjects treated are structural materials,\r\nabrasive materials (buhr stones, etc.), precious stones, fertilizers,\r\nglass materials, and, under many other headings, a complete review of\r\nthe titular subject appears. We also note a section of much interest on\r\nmineral paints, by Mr. Marcus Benjamin, F.C.S. In it the preparation\r\nof barytes as an adulterant for paints is described at some length.\r\nIn some instances an elaborate explanation of the classification of\r\npaints as adopted is given. In other cases it is entirely omitted. The\r\nfirst system is certainly preferable. A very full index closes the\r\nwork. It can be had on application to the Director of the United States\r\nGeological Survey, Washington, D.

M. W. asks (1) a receipt for marsh mallows, as made by\r\nconfectioners. A. Dissolve one-half pound of gum arabic in one pint\r\nof water, strain and add one half pound of fine sugar, and place over\r\nthe fire, stirring constantly until the sirup is dissolved, and all of\r\nthe consistency of honey. Add gradually the whites of four eggs well\r\nbeaten. Stir the mixture until it becomes somewhat thin and does not\r\nadhere to the finger. Flavor to taste and pour into a tin slightly\r\ndusted with powdered starch, and when cool divide into small squares.\r\n2. The title of a good veterinary journal. A. _American Veterinary\r\nReview_, New York. 3. The formula for a spavin cure? A. Take of sweet\r\noil 4 ounces, spirits of turpentine 2 ounces, oil of stone 1 ounce.\r\nMix and apply three times per day. 4. A receipt for a wash that will\r\nprevent rabbits from injuring the bark of fruit trees. A. We know of\r\nnothing good for this purpose.\r\n\r\n(2) A. L. K. asks how common fat can be rendered into tallow in an\r\nopen kettle. A. Keep the tallow melted for some time, along with about\r\ntwo per cent of sulphuric acid largely diluted with water, employing\r\nconstant agitation, and allowing the whole to cool slowly; then remelt\r\nthe cake with a large quantity of hot water, and wash well.\r\n\r\n(3) W. C. B. asks about the process and kind of machinery used in\r\npreparing raw sienna for paint. A. The raw sienna is thrown directly on\r\nthe hearth of a reverberatory furnace and kept thoroughly raked until\r\nit assumes a proper color. Very little, if any, sienna is known to be\r\nburnt in this country.\r\n\r\n(4) W. M. M. asks for some transparent paint suitable to paint on\r\ntracing muslin. A. You must use a transparent varnish such as the\r\nfollowing: Dissolve 30 parts of copal and 2 parts of camphor in 120\r\nparts of oil of turpentine and 30 parts of oil of lavender. Use lakes,\r\ngamboge, Prussian blue, and the other transparent colors, mixed with\r\nthe vehicle.\r\n\r\n(5) S. S. asks a receipt for black heads. A. Cover the parts afflicted\r\nwith a pomade consisting of kaolin 4 parts, glycerine 3 parts, acetic\r\nacid 2 parts, with the addition of a small quantity of ethereal oil.\r\nSee SUPPLEMENT, No. 542.\r\n\r\n(6) W. L. asks (1) a cure for frost bitten feet. A. For frost bites,\r\nrub the affected parts with pure oil of peppermint. It will also\r\nprevent the after effect of chilblains. Care should be taken to use\r\nonly the pure oil, and not the essence of peppermint, as the essence\r\nwill not have the desired effect. 2. How plate glass is made. A. See\r\nSCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT, No. 340.\r\n\r\n(7) A. T.--Hard rubber is a very good insulator; gutta percha is also\r\nvery good, and can be softened by boiling water and given any desired\r\nshape.\r\n\r\n(8) J. H. S. wants a good receipt to prevent hair coming out. A. Scald\r\nblack tea, 2 ounces, with 1 gallon of boiling water, strain, and add 3\r\nounces glycerine, tincture cantharides ½ ounce, bay rum 1 quart. Mix\r\nwell and perfume. This is a good preparation for frequent use in its\r\neffect both on the scalp and hair, but neither will be kept in good\r\ncondition without care and attention to general health. See articles in\r\nSUPPLEMENTS, 102, 388, 396.\r\n\r\n(9) A. H. asks the size of steel wire rope necessary to suspend a\r\nweight of 16,000 pounds, each end of the rope being fastened 1,600\r\nyards apart, the weight to travel from one end to the other on the\r\nrope. A. The scheme of so long a span carrying a load is impracticable.\r\nA span of 4,800 feet will nearly absorb the margin of safety by its own\r\nweight, depending upon the amount of deflection that could be allowed\r\nin the catenary curve. The largest steel cables that are made, 2⅝\r\ninches, weigh 13 pounds per foot, or over 31 net tons for your span;\r\nwith a deflection of one twenty-fifth, or nearly 200 feet, the tension\r\nwould be 3¼ times the weight, or 254,800 pounds, while the ultimate\r\nstrength is but 400,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n(10) G. A. L. asks: Why will a brake on the hind end of a train of\r\ncars hold more than a brake set ahead of it on train? A. We do not know\r\nthat it is so. It is possibly a fancy.\r\n\r\n(11) A. K. H. asks: Will hot air cool off by sending it rapidly through\r\na wooden tube 300 or 400 feet long? If so, how much? A. Yes, slightly.\r\nAn iron pipe is better if you wish to cool the air. How much the air\r\nwill be cooled will depend on initial temperature and the temperature\r\nof the conductor and surrounding air.\r\n\r\n(12) H. H. writes: I have large quantities of iron and steel to pickle,\r\nor, in other words, to clean. I use oil of vitriol, which is expensive\r\nand dangerous. Is there an acid that would be cheaper and at the\r\nsame time as effective? A. We know of nothing cheaper or better than\r\nsulphuric acid for pickling castings. The most economical method, as\r\npracticed here, is found in the hot bath, a tub lined with lead, or if\r\nof small requirement a stone pot. Water 5 to 8 parts, acid 1 part. Boil\r\nthe work in the acid bath for a few minutes, then rinse in hot water.\r\nThere is no danger if properly managed. For wrought iron and steel,\r\nuse hydrochloric acid and water.\r\n\r\n(13) W. F. E. asks: 1. How are bath bricks made? A. Bath bricks are\r\nfound native as minerals, and are imported from England. 2. How are\r\npapier mache ornaments moulded, and where can I procure a work on the\r\nsubject? A. We can send you Spons' \"Workshop Receipts\" for $2.00, first\r\nseries, which contains full information on papier mache. See also\r\nvarious articles in SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT on the\r\ntechnology of the paper trade.\r\n\r\n(14) W. M. S. asks how to make liquid glue. A. Take a wide mouthed\r\nbottle, and dissolve in it 8 ounces best glue in ½ pint water, by\r\nsetting it in a vessel of water, and heating until dissolved. Then add\r\nslowly 2½ ounces strong nitric acid 36° Baume, stirring all the while.\r\nEffervescence takes place, with generation of fumes. When all the acid\r\nhas been added, the liquid is allowed to cool. Keep it well corked, and\r\nit will be ready for use at any time.\r\n\r\n(15) E. H. F. asks what preparation steam laundries use to make their\r\ngoods so stiff and have such a fine gloss, and how is it used, and,\r\nif used with starch, is hot or cold starch used? A. Melt 2½ pounds\r\nof the very best A 1 paraffine wax over a slow fire. When liquefied,\r\nremove from the fire and stir in 100 drops oil of citronella. Have a\r\nlot of round new pie tins, clean and nice; place them on a level table,\r\ncoat them slightly with sweet oil, and pour about six tablespoonfuls\r\nof the enamel into each tin. The pan may be floated in water to cool\r\nthe contents sufficiently to permit the mixture to be cut or stamped\r\nout with a tin cutter into small cakes about the size of a peppermint\r\nlozenge. Two of these cakes added to each pint of starch will cause the\r\nsmoothing iron to impart the finest possible finish to muslin or linen,\r\nbesides perfuming the clothes.\r\n\r\n(16) J. T. M., Jr., asks for a tempering liquid for tempering a flat\r\ncoiled spring, ⅛ of an inch thick, 1½ inches wide, 20 feet long,\r\nwithout drawing the temper. A. You can get a spring temper in the\r\nhardening bath. Harden in water or oil and draw temper in an iron pan\r\nof linseed oil at boiling temperature.\r\n\r\n(17) C. E. H. writes: I have nearly 1,000 feet of out-door steam\r\npipe carried in elevated wooden boxes. What is a good and cheap pipe\r\ncovering to prevent loss of heat? A. Pulverized charcoal or sawdust\r\nmakes a good cheap insulation for steam pipes. The boxes should be\r\nlarge enough to allow 2 inches clearance all around the pipe, the\r\nlatter to be retained in position by cleats. Boxes should be tight\r\nenough to prevent circulation of air. Tar the outside to make weather\r\nproof.\r\n\r\n(18) B. L. asks: 1. Is there any method for removing rust stains from\r\nwhite cloth or linen? A. See the table in SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN\r\nSUPPLEMENT No. 158, for the \"Removal of Stains and Grease Spots.\"\r\n2. Is there any book showing how to work out chemical problems, and\r\ngiving answer in the back of the book? A. Professor J. P. Cooke's\r\n\"Chemical Problems and Reactions\" can be sent you postpaid for $1.\r\n\r\n(19) D. B. wants a receipt for a dark cherry stain for a white pine\r\nfloor. A. Use rain water 3 quarts, annatto 4 ounces; boil in a copper\r\nkettle till the annatto is dissolved, then put in a piece of potash the\r\nsize of a walnut; keep it on the fire about half an hour longer, and it\r\nis ready to bottle for use.\r\n\r\n(20) J. T. S.--Engines with automatic cut-offs will run steady with\r\nvariable work. If you have a governor that only controls a throttle\r\nvalve, there will be a small variation of speed with as much variation\r\nin the work as you state. Much depends upon the relative amount of work\r\nabsorbed by the mill and the variable machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO INVENTORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn experience of forty years, and the preparation of more than one\r\nhundred thousand applications for patents at home and abroad, enable us\r\nto understand the laws and practice on both continents, and to possess\r\nunequaled facilities for procuring patents everywhere.

The\r\nrequirements of the officials of these countries caused much bother and\r\ndelay, and the expenses of a patent corresponded therewith.\r\n\r\nBut there no longer exists that trouble and delay in obtaining patents\r\nin either country. The proprietors of this paper have perfected\r\narrangements with resident professional gentlemen in both countries,\r\nBrazil and Mexico, which enables them to obtain patents within\r\nreasonable time and at reasonable cost.\r\n\r\nThese two countries embrace an enormous area of territory, and makers\r\nof improved machinery and implements are now finding a market for their\r\nproducts in those countries.\r\n\r\nThe cost need no longer deter inventors from obtaining patents in\r\neither Brazil or Mexico.\r\n\r\nFor further information address\r\n\r\n\r\n  MUNN & CO.,\r\n  Proprietors SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN,\r\n  361 Broadway, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCutler's Pocket Inhaler\r\n\r\n\r\nAND CARBOLATE OF IODINE INHALANT.

A British patent includes England, Scotland, Wales,\r\nIreland and the Channel Islands. Great Britain is the acknowledged\r\nfinancial and commercial center of the world, and her goods are sent to\r\nevery quarter of the globe. A good invention is likely to realize as\r\nmuch for the patentee in England as his United States patent produces\r\nfor him at home, and the small cost now renders it possible for almost\r\nevery patentee in this country to secure a patent in Great Britain,\r\nwhere his rights are as well projected as in the United States.\r\n\r\n=OTHER COUNTRIES.=--Patents are also obtained on very reasonable terms\r\nin France, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Russia, Italy, Spain (the latter\r\nincludes Cuba and all the other Spanish Colonies), Brazil, British\r\nIndia, Australia, and the other British Colonies.\r\n\r\nAn experience of =FORTY= years has enabled the publishers of THE\r\nSCIENTIFIC AMERICAN to establish competent and trustworthy\r\nagencies in all the principal foreign countries, and it has always been\r\ntheir aim to have the business of their clients promptly and properly\r\ndone and their interests faithfully guarded.\r\n\r\nA pamphlet containing a synopsis of the patent laws of all countries,\r\nincluding the cost for each, and other information useful to\r\npersons contemplating the procuring of patents abroad, may be had on\r\napplication to this office.\r\n\r\n=MUNN & CO.,= Editors and Proprietors of THE SCIENTIFIC\r\nAMERICAN, cordially invite all persons desiring any information\r\nrelative to patents, or the registry of trade-marks, in this country\r\nor abroad, to call at their offices, 361 Broadway.
