Had Volume II been written ten years ago, the discoveries made in\r\nthe course of the last decade would have given an out-of-date character\r\nto much of the subject-matter. It is more especially in regard to the\r\nFerns and the extinct members of the Gymnosperms that our outlook has\r\nbeen materially altered by recent contributions to Palaeobotany. It is,\r\nhowever, some satisfaction to be able to add that recent progress has\r\nbeen relatively slight in that part of the subject dealt with in the\r\nfirst volume.\r\n\r\nThe original intention was to complete the whole work in two volumes.\r\nSoon after the second volume was begun, it became evident that the\r\nremaining divisions of the plant-kingdom could not be included within\r\nthe compass of a single volume. I decided, therefore, to take the\r\nconsequences of having embarked on too ambitious a plan of treatment,\r\nand to preserve uniformity of proportion by reserving the seed-bearing\r\nplants for a third volume. The third volume will include the\r\nPteridosperms, other than those briefly described in the final chapter\r\nof the present volume, and other classes of Gymnosperms. I propose also\r\nto devote such space as is available within the limits of a text-book\r\nto the neglected subject of the geographical distribution of plants at\r\ndifferent stages in the history of the earth. It is my intention to\r\ncomplete Volume III with as little delay as possible. As I have written\r\nelsewhere, the past history of the Flowering plants needs special\r\ntreatment, and anything more than a mere compilation can be adequately\r\nattempted only after considerable research and with the assistance\r\nof botanists possessing a special knowledge of different families of\r\nAngiosperms. The need of a critical examination of available data in\r\nregard to the geological history of this dominant group will not be\r\nlost sight of.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that while certain genera have received an undue share\r\nof attention in the present volume, others have been ignored or treated\r\nwith scant consideration. For this inconsistency I have no excuse\r\nto offer, beyond the statement that the subject is a large one, and\r\nselection is necessary even though the work consists of three volumes.\r\n\r\nThe publication in 1909 of a collection of excellent photographs of\r\nPalaeozoic Plants, with brief descriptive notes, by Mr Newell Arber, as\r\none of a series of popular “Nature Books,” bears striking testimony to\r\nthe remarkable spread of interest in the study of the vegetation of the\r\npast, which is one of the outstanding features in the recent history of\r\nbotanical science.\r\n\r\nIn the list of illustrations I have mentioned the source of all figures\r\nwhich have been previously published. I would, however, supplement the\r\nstatement of fact with an expression of thanks to corporate bodies and\r\nto individuals who have allowed me to make use of blocks, drawings, or\r\nphotographs.\r\n\r\nI wish to thank my colleague, Mr A. G. Tansley, for placing at my\r\ndisposal several blocks originally published in the pages of the _New\r\nPhytologist_. To Professor Bertrand of Lille and to his son Dr Paul\r\nBertrand I am indebted for several prints and descriptive notes of\r\nspecimens in their possession. My friends Dr Nathorst of Stockholm\r\nand Dr Zeiller of Paris have generously responded to my requests for\r\ninformation on various points. I wish especially to thank Dr Kidston\r\nfor several excellent prints of specimens in his collection and for the\r\nloan of sections. I have profited by more than one examination of his\r\nsplendid collection at Stirling. Professor Weiss has generously allowed\r\nme to borrow sections from the Manchester University collections, more\r\nespecially several which have been reproduced in the chapter devoted\r\nto the genus _Lepidodendron_. To Professor F. W. Oliver my thanks are\r\ndue for the loan of sections from the collection under his charge at\r\nUniversity College. I have pleasure also in thanking Dr Scott, not\r\nonly for lending me sections of a Lepidodendron and for allowing me\r\nto use some drawings of _Miadesmia_ originally made by Mrs Scott for\r\nreproduction in his invaluable book, _Studies in Fossil Botany_, but\r\nfor kindly undertaking the laborious task of reading the proofs of this\r\nvolume. It would be unfair to express my gratitude to Dr Scott for many\r\nhelpful suggestions and criticisms, without explicitly stating that\r\nthanks to a friend for reading proofs must not be interpreted as an\r\nattempt to claim his support for all statements or views expressed. The\r\nGeneral Editor of the Series, Mr A. E. Shipley, has also kindly read\r\nthe proofs. I am under obligations also for assistance of various kinds\r\nto Prof. Thomas of Auckland, New Zealand, to Mr Boodle of Kew, to Mr\r\nD. M. S. Watson of Manchester, to Mr T. G. Hill of University College,\r\nand to Mr Gordon of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. I am indebted to the\r\nkind offices of Miss M. C. Knowles for the photograph of the specimen\r\nof _Archaeopteris hibernica_ in the Irish National Museum, Dublin,\r\nreproduced on page 561.\r\n\r\nMany of the illustrations are reproduced from drawings by my wife:\r\nthose made from the actual specimens are distinguished by the addition\r\nof the initials M. S. I am grateful to her also for some improvements\r\nin the letter-press. For the drawings made from sections and for some\r\nof the outline sketches I am responsible. I have availed myself freely\r\nof the facilities afforded by Professor McKenny Hughes in the Sedgwick\r\nMuseum of Geology for the examination of specimens under the charge of\r\nMr Newell Arber, the University Demonstrator in Palaeobotany. It is\r\na pleasure to add that, as on former occasions, I am indebted to the\r\nvigilance of the Readers of the University Press for the detection of\r\nseveral errors which escaped my notice in the revision of the proofs.\r\n\r\n                                                        A.

Occasionally there are three series, as represented in\r\nfig. 112. In another type of strobilus, _Sphenophyllostachys Römeri_[3]\r\neach sporangiophore terminates in two pendulous sporangia (fig. 113,\r\nA; see also fig. 107, C, vol. I.). It has already been pointed out\r\nthat the common occurrence of detached strobili necessitates their\r\ndescription under distinct specific names; it is only by a rare\r\naccident that we can assign fossil cones to their vegetative shoots.\r\nThere are, however, reasons for believing that _Sphenophyllostachys\r\nDawsoni_ is the strobilus of the plant originally described by\r\nSternberg[4] from impressions of foliage-shoots as _Rotularia\r\ncuneifolia_. Another difficulty presented by petrified material is\r\nthat of determining, with certainty, whether two imperfect specimens,\r\ndiffering from one another in features which do not appear to be of\r\nsufficient importance to warrant specific separation, are forms of one\r\nspecies or portions of specifically distinct cones. It has been pointed\r\nout by Scott[5] that the strobilus known as _Sphenophyllostachys\r\nDawsoni_ probably includes two distinct species, one being the cone\r\nof _Sphenophyllum cuneifolium_ Sternb., and the other the cone of\r\n_S. myriophyllum_ Crép[6]. The stem of _S. myriophyllum_ agrees\r\nanatomically with the type known as _Sphenophyllum plurifoliatum_ Will.\r\nand Scott[7].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112. Sketch of a radial longitudinal section of\r\n  _Sphenophyllostachys_. There are usually two concentric series of\r\n  sporangia on the sporophylls, not three as shown in the figure.\r\n  The upper figure (after Zeiller) shows the linear bracts in\r\n  surface-view.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the two types of cone already mentioned,\r\n_Sphenophyllostachys Dawsoni_ and _S. Römeri_, others have been\r\ndescribed by Kidston from carbonised impressions. One of these is the\r\nfertile branch of _Sphenophyllum majus_[8]. The basal portions of the\r\nbracts of each whorl form a narrow collar round the axis of the cone;\r\nthe free portion of each bract consists of a lamina divided into two\r\nequal bifid lobes bearing on its upper surface one group, or possibly\r\ntwo groups, of four sessile sporangia between the narrow coherent bases\r\nof the laminae and the sinus between the terminal lobes (fig. 113, C).\r\nAnother characteristic feature is the greater length of the internodes;\r\nthis renders the cone less compact and less sharply differentiated from\r\nthe vegetative shoots than those of other species. A specimen in Dr\r\nKidston’s collection illustrates the peculiar character of the fertile\r\nportion of this species; it consists of an axis bearing a succession of\r\nlax sporophylls succeeded above and below by whorls of sterile leaves.\r\nIn this species, therefore, we cannot speak of a compact strobilus at\r\nthe end of a shoot of limited growth, but of axes in which sterile and\r\nfertile leaves are borne alternately[9], a condition recalling the\r\nalternation of foliage leaves and sporophylls in _Tmesipteris_ and in\r\n_Lycopodium Selago_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113.\r\n\r\n  A. _Sphenophyllostachys Römeri._ (Solms-Laubach.)\r\n  B. _Sphenophyllum trichomatosum_ Stur.\r\n  C. _Sphenophyllum majus._ Bronn. (A–C. After Kidston.)]\r\n\r\nAnother form of cone, also from the Middle Coal Measures, is referred\r\nby Kidston to _Sphenophyllum trichomatosum_ Stur[10] (fig. 113, B):\r\nthis is characterised by the more horizontal position of the bracts,\r\nwhich “do not appear to be so much or so suddenly bent upwards in their\r\ndistal portion as in some other species of _Sphenophyllum_,” and by\r\nsessile sporangia borne singly on the upper face of each bract.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114. _Sphenophyllostachys fertilis_ (Scott).\r\n  (After Scott.)

The petrified specimen\r\non which the species was founded was discovered by Mr James Lomax in\r\nthe Lower Coal Measures of Lancashire; it represents a portion of a\r\ncone 6 cm. long and approximately 12 mm. broad. The axis contains a\r\nsingle vascular cylinder agreeing in essentials with the type of stem\r\nstructure known as _Sphenophyllum plurifoliatum_. The nodal regions,\r\nwhich exhibit the slight swelling characteristic of the genus, bear\r\nseveral (probably twelve) appendages connate at the base and forming\r\na narrow flange encircling the axis. Each bract, the base of which\r\nforms part of the narrow collar surrounding the axis, consists of two\r\nlobes, ventral and dorsal, divided palmately into several (sometimes\r\nfour) segments or sporangiophores (fig. 115). Each sporangiophore\r\nterminates distally in an oblong or oval lamina bearing two sporangia\r\non its adaxial face (fig. 114). The space between the axis and the\r\nperiphery of the cone is thus occupied by crowded peltate laminae,\r\neach with its pair of sporangia. A single vascular bundle supplies\r\neach sporangiophore and bifurcates in the distal lamina into two\r\nbranches which extend to the bases of the sporangia. The sporangia\r\nagree in structure with those of other species of _Sphenophyllum_: the\r\nspores are of one size and elliptical, characterised by the presence\r\nof several sharp ridges or flanges encircling the spore-wall in the\r\ndirection of the major-axis. _Sphenophyllostachys fertilis_ differs\r\nfrom all previously recorded types in the absence of sterile bracts.\r\nThe appendages of the cone-axis are all fertile, a striking contrast\r\nto the differentiation into protective and sporangia-bearing bracts\r\nwhich constitutes a constant feature in the cones of _Sphenophyllum_\r\nand _Calamites_. It is possible, as Scott suggests, that the absence of\r\nsterile segments is the result of modification of the more usual type\r\nof strobilus; instead of the dorsal and ventral lobes of the bracts\r\nsharing between them the duties of protection and spore-production,\r\nthe whole of each bract is constructed on the plan of the maximum\r\nspore-output, the laminar terminations of the sporangiophores\r\nserving the purpose of protection. The cone may be described as\r\nmore specialised than the normal type of strobilus for reproductive\r\npurposes[12].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115. _Sphenophyllostachys fertilis_ (Scott).\r\n  (After Scott.) Diagram of a single sporophyll as it would appear\r\n  in a transverse section of the cone; showing one lobe (dorsal or\r\n  ventral). _ax_, part of axis to which the sporophylls are attached.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116. _Sphenophyllostachys Dawsoni._ (After\r\n  Thoday.) A. Larger spores; B, abortive spores; C, mature spores\r\n  showing the characteristic spines.]\r\n\r\nIt has been stated, on evidence which is unsatisfactory, that\r\n_Sphenophyllum_ possesses two kinds of spores. While regarding the\r\ngenus as homosporous on the evidence before us, it is interesting\r\nto find that cases occur in which the spores in the same sporangium\r\nexhibit a marked difference in size. Attention has been called by\r\nWilliamson and Scott[13] to variation in the dimensions of spores: a\r\nmore pronounced difference in size has been recorded by Mr Thoday[14]\r\nwho gives 120μ as the maximum and 90μ as the minimum diameter of the\r\nspores in a cone of _Sphenophyllostachys Dawsoni_. The presence of\r\nseveral abortive spores in the sporangium (fig. 116) containing the\r\nlarger spores favours the view that this difference in size may be the\r\nfirst step towards the development of heterospory.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the types of strobilus designated\r\n_Sphenophyllostachys_ (figs. 112–114) present a divergence of\r\ncharacters too great to be comprised under one genus; but in the\r\nabsence of fuller information, we cannot do otherwise than follow the\r\nonly logical custom of grouping them together as examples of strobili\r\nborne by plants which, in the present state of our knowledge, are most\r\nconveniently referred to the genus _Sphenophyllum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Cheirostrobus._\r\n\r\nThis generic name was applied by Dr Scott[15] to a calcified cone\r\nobtained by Mr James Bennie in 1883 from the Lower Carboniferous\r\nplant-beds of Pettycur near Burntisland on the Firth of Forth.\r\n_Cheirostrobus_ is distinguished from _Sphenophyllostachys_ by its\r\ngreater breadth (3.5 cm.); externally it agrees more closely with the\r\nfertile shoots of _Lepidodendron_ than with those of _Sphenophyllum_.\r\nA single vascular cylinder having the form of a fluted Doric column\r\n(fig. 117, B, _x_) occupies the axis of the cone: it consists for\r\nthe most part of reticulate tracheae which tend to assume a short\r\nor isodiametric form in the central region; the smaller protoxylem\r\ntracheids with the spiral form of pitting constitute the sharp and\r\nprominent ridges at the periphery of the xylem-cylinder. In the\r\nouter part of the cylinder the metaxylem[16] consists exclusively of\r\ntracheae, but towards the centre of the axis these are associated with\r\nnumerous parenchymatous cells.\r\n\r\nThe xylem is therefore centripetal in origin as in _Sphenophyllum_\r\nand in nearly all recent and fossil members of the Lycopodiales. In\r\nthe type-specimen of _Cheirostrobus_ the vascular cylinder of the\r\ncone consists entirely of primary xylem, but secondary xylem has been\r\nfound in a more recently discovered specimen[17]. Secondary xylem\r\noccurs also in the peduncle of the cone. No appreciable remains of\r\nphloem have been found. The cortex consists of slightly elongated\r\nrather thick-walled tissue containing secretory sacs. Crowded\r\nsuperposed whorls of bracts (or sporophylls), usually twelve in each\r\nwhorl, are borne on the axis and each sporophyll receives a single\r\nvascular bundle from one of the vertical ridges of the xylem column\r\n(fig. 117, A, _lt_). The members of each whorl are connate at the\r\nbase: from this narrow collar each sporophyll branches into an upper\r\nor dorsal and a lower or ventral limb (fig. 117, A, _f_ and _s_).\r\nEach limb divides palmately at a short distance from its origin into\r\nthree slender segments, which extend in a horizontal direction and\r\nterminate in large laminar expansions (fig. 117, B, _s_) to afford\r\na protective covering to the surface of the cone. The upper set of\r\nthree segments, constituting sporangiophores (fig. 117, A, B, _f_) or\r\nfertile divisions of the sporophyll, expand distally into comparatively\r\nbulky laminae; each of these bears on its adaxial face four diagonally\r\nplaced outgrowths which form the short pedicels of very long and narrow\r\nsporangia. The three lower segments—the sterile divisions of the\r\nsporophylls—(fig. 117, A, B, _s_) are similar to the upper set except\r\nin their greater length and in the kite-shaped form of their distal\r\nlaminae which are provided with lateral lobes. The single vascular\r\nstrand which supplies each sporophyll is represented at _lt_ in fig.\r\n117, B; at _lt′_ the strand has divided into four, the three upper\r\nbundles in the figure supply the sterile segments and the single lower\r\nbundle ultimately divides into three which supply the fertile segments.\r\nA pair of blunt processes (fig. A, _s_) extend downwards over the ends\r\nof the underlying fertile lamina and two slender prolongations extend\r\nupwards through several internodes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  FIG. 117.

Node of stem showing leaf-bases.]\r\n\r\nAn economical arrangement of the long and narrow sporangia and of the\r\nsporophyll-segments between the axis and the periphery of the cone\r\nis rendered possible by the interlocking of the sterile and fertile\r\nsegments by means of a groove in the upper face of the latter for\r\nthe accommodation of the former. The sporangia are characterised by\r\ntheir unusually long and narrow form: the length of a sporangium may\r\nreach 1 centimetre. In the structure of the wall the sporangia of\r\n_Cheirostrobus_ agree closely with those of _Calamostachys_[18] and\r\n_Sphenophyllostachys_. The spores are of one size only. The vascular\r\ncylinder of the peduncle, originally described by Williamson[19] as\r\nthe peduncle of a large _Lepidostrobus_ (the cone of _Lepidodendron_),\r\nis characterised by the presence of a short radially disposed zone\r\nof secondary tracheids, a feature, as Scott points out, which may\r\nextend into the axis of the cone. It is noteworthy that the protoxylem\r\nelements are not always external, but occasionally occur internal to\r\none or two of the outermost metaxylem tracheae: the usual exarch[20]\r\nstructure of the central cylinder is not therefore absolutely\r\nconstant, but may be replaced by a mesarch arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe presence of a few sterile leaves on the peduncle below the fertile\r\nportion of the cone, which agree in their lobed laminae with the\r\nsporophylls, is the only fact which we possess as to the form of the\r\nvegetative characters of the genus.\r\n\r\nThe above description is sufficient to indicate the extraordinary\r\ncomplexity and high degree of specialisation of _Cheirostrobus_. The\r\nsporophylls, with their trilobed segments, and the crowded sporangia of\r\nexceptional length attached only by a narrow base constitute striking\r\npeculiarities of the genus.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that we are still without any satisfactory evidence\r\nas to the nature of the plant the cones of which have been made the\r\ntype of a new genus and a new family. _Cheirostrobus_ affords an\r\ninteresting example of a type of reproductive shoot constructed on\r\na plan _sui generis_, and may be classed with some other extinct\r\ngenera as instances of the production in the course of evolution\r\nof architectural schemes which appear to have been ill adapted for\r\ncompetition with equally efficient though much simpler types. But the\r\ndiscovery of these isolated forms of restricted geological range among\r\nthe relics of the Palaeozoic vegetation frequently supplies a key to\r\nphylogenetic problems. _Cheirostrobus_ by its complex combination of\r\nfeatures characteristic of the Equisetales, the Lycopodiales and the\r\ngenus _Sphenophyllum_ throws a welcome light on the inter-relationships\r\nof groups which represent divergent series. The combination of\r\nmorphological features in this generalised type led the author of the\r\ngenus to describe it as a descendant of an old stock which existed\r\nprior to the divergence of the Equisetales and Lycopodiales.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of this new type of strobilus naturally led to a search\r\namong Lower Carboniferous plants for vegetative shoots exhibiting\r\ncharacters conformable with the whorled and branched leaves of\r\n_Cheirostrobus_. In _Sphenophyllum_ we have a genus obviously\r\ncomparable with _Cheirostrobus_ as regards the form and disposition\r\nof the leaves, but the differences between the cones and the striking\r\nsimilarity of the vascular cylinder of the latter to that of\r\n_Lepidodendron_ demonstrate conclusively that we must look elsewhere\r\nfor the vegetative members of the plant which produced cones of the\r\n_Cheirostrobus_ type.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PSEUDOBORNIA]\r\n\r\nIn 1902 Professor Nathorst[21] instituted the generic name\r\n_Pseudobornia_ for plants of which imperfect examples had previously\r\nbeen referred by Heer[22] to _Calamites_ under the name _C. radiatus_.\r\nHeer’s plants were obtained from Upper Devonian rocks of Bear Island\r\nin the Arctic seas and additional specimens were brought from the\r\nsame locality by the Swedish Polar Expedition of 1898. _Pseudobornia_\r\npossesses jointed stems (fig. 117, D) bearing whorled and shortly\r\nstalked leaves, often four in number, at each node. The leaves are\r\npalmately branched with fine serrated edges (fig. 117, C). Certain\r\nspecimens, which are no doubt correctly described by Nathorst as\r\ncones, are characterised by a thick axis bearing whorled leaves\r\nwith sporangia on their lower surfaces, but the material is not\r\nsufficiently well preserved to render possible a recognition of\r\nstructural details. It has been suggested by Scott that _Pseudobornia_\r\nmay possibly be referable to the Sphenophyllales and that the stem of\r\n_Cheirostrobus_ “may have had something in common with” Nathorst’s\r\ngenus[23]. The beds in which the stems occur are of Upper Devonian age,\r\nwhile _Cheirostrobus_ was found in Lower Carboniferous rocks: this\r\ndifference in age is not, however, a serious objection to the validity\r\nof the comparison. We cannot do more than express the view that\r\n_Pseudobornia_, so far as can be ascertained without an examination of\r\npetrified material or of more perfect impressions of strobili, exhibits\r\nvegetative features not inconsistent with the morphological characters\r\nof the fertile shoots known as _Cheirostrobus_.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nThe institution of a special group-name for the reception of\r\n_Sphenophyllum_ is justified by the sum of its morphological features,\r\nwhich do not sufficiently conform to those of any existing group of\r\nPteridophytes to warrant its inclusion in a system of classification\r\nbased on recent genera. In the case of _Cheirostrobus_ we are limited\r\nto the characters of the cone and its peduncle. The suggestion that\r\nthe Devonian fossils known as _Pseudobornia_ may represent the foliage\r\nshoots of a plant closely related to _Cheirostrobus_ has still to\r\nbe proved correct. Although we may find justification in the highly\r\ncomplex and peculiar structure of _Cheirostrobus_ for the recognition\r\nof the genus as a type of still another group of Pteridophytes, it\r\nwould be unwise to take this step without additional knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe undoubted similarity between _Cheirostrobus_ and _Sphenophyllum_\r\ncoupled with striking points of difference favours the inclusion of the\r\ntwo genera in distinct families placed, for the present at least, in\r\nthe group Sphenophyllales.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Group =SPHENOPHYLLALES=.\r\n\r\n               =Sphenophylleae=: genus _Sphenophyllum_.\r\n               =Cheirostrobeae=: genus _Cheirostrobus_.\r\n\r\nIt has recently been proposed to include the family Psilotaceae,\r\ncomprising the two recent genera _Psilotum_ and _Tmesipteris_, as\r\nanother subdivision of the Sphenophyllales. This proposal had been made\r\nby Professor Thomas[24] primarily on the ground that the sporophylls\r\nof _Tmesipteris_ and _Psilotum_ appear to afford the closest parallel\r\namong existing plants to the peculiar form of sporophyll characteristic\r\nof the Sphenophyllales. The morphological interpretation of the\r\nsporophylls of both _Sphenophyllum_ and _Cheirostrobus_ has been the\r\nsource of considerable discussion[25]. If we regard each sporophyll\r\nas a leaf with two lobes, one fertile and one sterile, except in the\r\ncase of _Sphenophyllostachys fertilis_ in which both are fertile, an\r\nobvious comparison may be made with the fern _Ophioglossum_; but the\r\ndifference between a single fern frond, consisting of a comparatively\r\nlarge sterile lamina bearing a fertile branch composed of a long axis\r\nwith two rows of sporangia embedded in its tissues, and the whorled\r\nsporophylls of _Sphenophyllum_ is considerable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PSILOTACEAE]\r\n\r\nA brief reference may be made to the principal reasons which have\r\nled to the suggestion that the Psilotaceae should be included in\r\nthe Sphenophyllales. The shoots of _Tmesipteris_ bear simple foliage\r\nleaves spirally disposed on a slender axis, and in association with\r\nthese occur sporophylls consisting of a short axis bearing a pair of\r\nsmall lobes and a bilocular synangium[26] (fig. 120, B). The synangium\r\nis seated on a very short stalk given off from its sporophyll at the\r\nbase of the pair of laminae: the synangium with its short stalk may be\r\nspoken of as the sporangiophore. In most cases the synangium appears\r\nto be sessile on the sporophyll, but occasionally the much reduced\r\nstalk is prolonged and forms an obvious feature. Dr Scott[27] suggested\r\nthat the Tmesipteris synangium with its axis may correspond to the\r\nventral lobe (or sporangiophore) of _Sphenophyllum_. In the latter\r\ngenus the whorled sporophylls consist in most species of a dorsal\r\nand a ventral lobe, the latter serving as a sporangiophore bearing\r\none or more sporangia; in _Tmesipteris_ the sporophylls are spirally\r\ndisposed and each consists of a bilobed sterile portion bearing a\r\nseptate sporangium or bilocular synangium on a very short ventral lobe.\r\nProfessor Bower[28], in his account of the development and structure of\r\nthe sporophylls of _Tmesipteris_, drew attention to the comparatively\r\nfrequent occurrence of abnormal sporophylls and spoke of the plant as\r\nunstable. More recently Professor Thomas[29] of Auckland has carefully\r\nexamined living plants, with the result that variations of different\r\nkinds are proved to be exceedingly common. He finds that sporophylls\r\noccur which exhibit repeated dichotomy of the axis (fig. 120, D, F) and\r\nthus each may bear four instead of two leaf-lobes and three synangia,\r\none at the first fork and one at each of the forks of the second\r\norder[30].\r\n\r\nOther abnormalities occur in which the synangium is raised on a\r\ndistinct stalk instead of being more or less sessile at the point from\r\nwhich the leaf-lobes diverge. A third form of departure from the normal\r\nis that in which there is no synangium on the bilobed sporophyll, its\r\nplace being taken by a leaf-lobe. The deduction from the occurrence of\r\nthese abnormalities is that the synangium of _Tmesipteris_ represents\r\na ventral leaf-lobe, as Scott suggested. Professor Thomas draws\r\nattention to the resemblance between _Tmesipteris_ sporophylls and\r\nthe foliage-leaves of _Sphenophyllum_, which are either simple with\r\ndichotomously branched veins or the lamina is deeply divided into two\r\nor more segments. In some types of _Sphenophyllostachys_ the bracts\r\nare simple (_S. Dawsoni_), but in others (_Sphenophyllum majus_, fig.\r\n113, C) they are forked like the foliage-leaves and bear a close\r\nresemblance to the abnormal sporophylls of _Tmesipteris_. Moreover,\r\nin _Sphenophyllostachys Römeri_ (fig. 113, A) each ventral lobe of\r\na sporophyll bears two sporangia, a condition almost identical with\r\nthat represented by the occasional occurrence of a synangium on a\r\ncomparatively long stalk in _Tmesipteris_. Similarly the more elaborate\r\nsporophylls of _Cheirostrobus_ may be compared with the branched\r\nsporophylls of _Tmesipteris_ (fig. 120). This agreement between the\r\nsporophylls of the Palaeozoic and recent genera acquires additional\r\nimportance from the very close resemblance between the exarch stele\r\nof _Sphenophyllum_ and that of the genus _Psilotum_, which conforms\r\nto the Palaeozoic type not only in the centripetal character of the\r\nprimary xylem and in its exarch structure, but also in the occasional\r\noccurrence of secondary xylem[31], and in the stellate form of its\r\ntransverse section. The occasional mesarch structure of the stele of\r\n_Cheirostrobus_ finds a parallel in the mesarch xylem groups in the\r\nstem of _Tmesipteris_. It is thus on the strength of these resemblances\r\nthat Thomas and Bower would remove the Psilotaceae from the group\r\nLycopodiales and unite them with _Sphenophyllum_ and _Cheirostrobus_\r\nin the Sphenophyllales. While admitting the validity of the comparison\r\nbriefly referred to above, I prefer to retain the Psilotaceae\r\nas a division of the Pteridophyta including only _Psilotum_ and\r\n_Tmesipteris_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SPHENOPHYLLUM]\r\n\r\nIn his recent book on _The Origin of Land Flora_, Prof. Bower raises\r\nobjection to the use of the term ventral lobe in speaking of the\r\nsporangium-bearing stalk or sporangiophore borne on the sporophyll\r\nof _Sphenophyllum_. He points out that the use of this term implies\r\nthe derivation of the sporangiophore by metamorphosis of part of a\r\nvegetative leaf, an opinion untenable in the absence of proof. The\r\ndesignation sporangiophore is no doubt preferable to that of ventral\r\nlobe as it carries with it no admission of particular morphological\r\nvalue; as a further concession to a non-committal attitude we may\r\nprovisionally at least regard a sporangiophore as an organ _sui\r\ngeneris_ “and not the result of modification of any other part[32].”\r\n\r\nThe view put forward by Prof. Lignier[33] that the Sphenophyllales are\r\ndescendants of primitive ferns is not convincing, and his comparison\r\nof _Sphenophyllum_ with _Archaeopteris_ lacks force in view of our\r\nignorance as to the nature of the reproductive organs of the latter\r\ngenus. That the Sphenophyllales are connected with the Equisetales and\r\nwith the Psilotales by important morphological features is clear; but\r\nthe comparison between the sporophylls of the extinct genera with those\r\nof the existing genus _Tmesipteris_, though helpful and possibly based\r\non true homology, cannot be considered as settling the morphological\r\nvalue of the sporangiophores of _Sphenophyllum_ and _Cheirostrobus_.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to discuss at length the different views in regard\r\nto the morphological nature of the sporangiophore of _Sphenophyllum_.\r\nThe comparison, which we owe in the first instance to Scott, with the\r\nsynangium of the Psilotales with its short stalk, though not accepted\r\nby Lignier as a comparison based on true homology, is one which\r\nappeals to many botanists and is probably the best so far suggested.\r\nThe further question, whether these sporangiophores are to be called\r\nfoliar or axial structures is one which has been answered by several\r\nauthors, but it is improbable that we shall soon arrive at a decision\r\nlikely to be accepted as final. Discussions of this kind tend to\r\nassume an exaggerated importance and frequently carry with them the\r\nimplication that every appendage of the nature of a sporangiophore\r\ncan be labelled either shoot or leaf. We treat the question from an\r\nacademic standpoint and run a risk of ignoring the fact that the\r\nconception of stem and leaf is based on morphological characteristics,\r\nwhich have been evolved as the result of gradual differentiation of\r\nparts of one originally homogeneous whole. There is much that is\r\nattractive in the view recently propounded by Mr Tansley that a leaf is\r\nnot an appendicular organ differing _ab initio_ from the axis on which\r\nit is borne, but that it is in phylogenetic origin a “branch-system of\r\na primitive undifferentiated sporangium-bearing thallus[34].” Admitting\r\nthe probability that this view is correct, our faith in the importance\r\nof discussions on the morphological nature of sporangiophores is\r\nshaken, and we realise the possibility that our zeal for formality and\r\nclassification may lead to results inconsistent with an evolutionary\r\nstandpoint[35].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n                              PSILOTALES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two recent genera _Psilotum_ and _Tmesipteris_ are usually spoken\r\nof as members of the family Psilotaceae which is included as one of the\r\nsubdivisions of the Lycopodiales. It is probable, as Scott[36] first\r\nsuggested, that these two plants are more nearly allied than are any\r\nother existing types to the Palaeozoic genus _Sphenophyllum_.\r\n\r\nWe may give expression to the undoubted resemblances between\r\n_Tmesipteris_ and _Psilotum_ and the Sphenophyllales by including the\r\nrecent genera as members of that group, originally founded on the\r\nextinct genus _Sphenophyllum_; this is the course adopted by Thomas[37]\r\nand by Bower[38]: or we may emphasise the fact that these two recent\r\ngenera differ in certain important respects from _Lycopodium_ and\r\n_Selaginella_ by removing them to a separate group, the Psilotales.\r\nThe latter course is preferred on the ground that the inclusion of\r\n_Psilotum_ and _Tmesipteris_ in a group founded on an extinct and\r\nnecessarily imperfectly known type, is based on insufficient evidence\r\nand carries with it an assumption of closer relationship than has been\r\nsatisfactorily established.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Tmesipteris_ (fig. 120, A) is represented by a single\r\nspecies _T. tannensis_ Bertr.[39] which usually occurs as an epiphyte\r\non the stems of tree-ferns in Australia, New Zealand, and Polynesia.\r\n_Psilotum_, with two species _P. triquetrum_ Sw. (fig. 118) and\r\n_P. complanatum_ Sw., flourishes in moist tropical regions of both\r\nhemispheres, growing either on soil rich in organic substances or as an\r\nepiphyte. Both genera are considered to be more or less saprophytic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118. _Psilotum triquetrum_ (½ natural size).\r\n\r\n  A. Synangium.\r\n  B. Sporophyll after removal of the synangium. (M.S.)]\r\n\r\n_Psilotum._ The common tropical species _P. triquetrum_ (fig. 118) is\r\ncharacterised by an underground rhizome which forms a confused mass\r\nof dark brown branches covered with filamentous hairs as substitutes\r\nfor roots and gives off erect repeatedly forked aerial shoots. In _P.\r\ncomplanatum_[40] the habit is similar to that of the more abundant\r\nand better-known species, but the pendulous shoots are characterised\r\nby their broader and flatter form. In both species the function of\r\ncarbon-assimilation is performed by the outer cortex of the green\r\nbranches, as the small size of the widely-separated foliage leaves\r\nrenders them practically useless as assimilating organs.\r\n\r\nThe sporophylls consist of a short axis terminating in two small\r\ndivergent forks and bearing on its adaxial surface a trilocular or in\r\nrare cases a bilocular synangium (fig. 118, A and B). The walls of the\r\nloculi are composed of several layers of cells and dehiscence takes\r\nplace along three lines radiating from the centre of the synangium.\r\nProfessor Thomas[41] has recorded “fairly numerous instances in\r\n_Psilotum_ of a second dichotomy of one branch of the first fork, or,\r\nless frequently, of both branches”: instead of one synangium subtended\r\nby the two slender leaflets of the forked sporophyll-axis, there\r\nmay be two synangia and three leaf-lobes or three synangia and four\r\nleaf-lobes. The occurrence of both these abnormalities in _Psilotum_\r\nand _Tmesipteris_ shows a decided tendency in the Psilotales to a\r\nrepeated dichotomy of the sporophylls[42].\r\n\r\nA single stele[43] with a fluted surface occupies the axis of an\r\naerial shoot (fig. 119, A); the axial region is occupied by a core of\r\nelongated mechanical elements (_s_), which may occasionally extend to\r\nthe periphery of the xylem and break the continuity of the band of\r\nscalariform tracheae (fig. 119, A, _a_). The tracheae form the arms of\r\nan irregularly stellate stele and each arm is terminated by protoxylem\r\nelements (fig. 119, B, _px_). The rays of the xylem cylinder, which\r\nmay be as many as six or eight in the upper part of the aerial shoots,\r\nbecome reduced in number as the rhizome is approached, assuming a\r\ndiarch structure near the junction. In the rhizome the xylem forms\r\nan approximately triangular group of tracheae without any core of\r\nmechanical elements. Three to four layers of parenchyma succeeded\r\nexternally by an ill-defined phloem (fig. 119, A, _p_) surround the\r\nxylem and a fairly distinct endodermis (fig. 119, A and B, _e_)\r\nencloses the whole. To Mr Boodle[44] is due the interesting discovery\r\nthat in some parts of the rhizome the parenchymatous zone surrounding\r\nthe scalariform tracheae may become the seat of meristematic\r\nactivity which results in the production of secondary tracheae\r\noften characterised by a sinuous longitudinal course. There is no\r\ndefinite cambium, but the radially disposed tracheae and the adjacent\r\nparenchymatous elements clearly demonstrate the secondary nature of the\r\ntissue immediately external to the group of primary xylem. Fig. 119, C,\r\ndrawn from a section kindly supplied by Mr Boodle, shows the secondary\r\nxylem elements at _x_² associated with radially disposed thin-walled\r\ncells abutting on the primary xylem, _x_¹. It is probable that this\r\nadded tissue may be a remnant of a more extensive secondary thickening\r\ncharacteristic of the ancestors of the recent species. In their manner\r\nof occurrence and sinuous course these secondary tracheids bear a\r\nresemblance to the secondary xylem of _Lepidodendron fuliginosum_[45].\r\nThe stele of the aerial shoot bears a fairly close resemblance to the\r\nvascular axis of _Cheirostrobus_, and its three-rayed form in the lower\r\nportions of the green branches recalls that of the _Sphenophyllum_\r\nstele, except that the axial xylem elements of the Palaeozoic genus\r\nare usually represented in _Psilotum_ by mechanical tissue. The\r\ncortex consists of three regions (fig. 119, A), an outer zone of\r\nchlorophyllous tissue (_a_) rich in intercellular spaces succeeded by\r\na band of mechanical tissue (_b_) which gradually passes into an inner\r\nregion of larger and thinner-walled cells (_c_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.\r\n\r\n  A.

Its brown rootless rhizome, which grows among the roots of\r\ntree-ferns or rarely in the ground, gives off pendulous or erect\r\nshoots reaching a length of two feet and bearing lanceolate mucronate\r\nleaves 2–3 cm. long (fig. 120, A) attached by decurrent leaf-bases.\r\nThe sporophylls, replacing the upper leaves or occurring in more or\r\nless well-defined zones alternating with the foliage leaves, consist\r\nof a short axis terminating in a pair of lanceolate lobes and bearing\r\non its adaxial surface an elongated bilocular synangium attached to a\r\nvery short stalk (fig. 120, B). Reference has already been made to the\r\ndivergent opinions as to the morphological nature of the sporophylls\r\nor sporangiophores, but recent investigations distinctly favour the\r\nview that a sporophyll is best interpreted as a stalked leaf with\r\ntwo sterile laminae and an almost sessile, or in some cases a more\r\nobviously stalked, synangium; the whole sporophyll is characterised\r\nby the possession of a ventral and a dorsal lobe[47]. The drawings\r\nreproduced in fig. 120, D and F, illustrate some of the frequent\r\nvariations described by Thomas in plants which he observed in the\r\nNew Zealand forests. The sporophyll shown in fig. 120, D and F, has\r\nbranched twice and bears three synangia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120. _Tmesipteris._\r\n\r\n  A. Foliage leaves.\r\n  B.

(From drawings made by Prof. Thomas and\r\n     generously placed at my disposal. A.C.S.)\r\n  E. Portion of C enlarged.]\r\n\r\nThe aerial branches of _Tmesipteris_ possess a central cylinder of\r\nseparate xylem groups in which the protoxylem occupies an internal\r\nposition (fig. 120, C and E, _px_) enclosing an axial parenchymatous\r\nregion. The cells of a few layers of the inner cortex immediately\r\noutside the endodermis are rendered conspicuous by a dark brown\r\ndeposit. The cortex as a whole is composed of uniform parenchymatous\r\ntissue. In the lower part of the aerial shoots and in the rhizome the\r\nxylem forms a solid strand without protoxylem elements and conforms\r\nmore clearly to that of _Psilotum_.\r\n\r\nIn this short account of the anatomy of _Tmesipteris_ no mention\r\nis made of the effect produced on the stele by the departure of\r\nleaf-traces and of vascular stands to supply branches. Miss Sykes[48]\r\nin a recently published paper on the genus has shown that the exit of\r\na leaf-trace does not break the continuity of the xylem of the stele,\r\nwhile the exit of a sporophyll-trace is marked by an obvious gap.\r\nEvidence is adduced in support of the conclusion that this difference,\r\nwhich at first sight appears to be one of morphological importance,\r\nis in reality merely a question of degree and “is due to the earlier\r\npreparation for the formation of ‘sporophyll’ than leaf-traces.”\r\nMiss Sykes gives her adherence to the view that the “sporophylls” of\r\n_Tmesipteris_ are branches and not leaves, but despite the arguments\r\nadvanced this interpretation seems to me less probable than that which\r\nrecognises the sporophyll as a foliar organ. Prof. Lignier[49] has\r\npointed out that if Miss Sykes’s conclusion as to the axial nature\r\nof the sporophyll in _Tmesipteris_ is accepted, it diminishes the\r\nforce of the comparison between the sporophylls of that genus and\r\n_Sphenophyllum_ as those of the latter can hardly be regarded as other\r\nthan foliar organs.\r\n\r\nBoth members of the Psilotales may, as Boodle has suggested, be\r\nregarded as descendants of a common parent in which the aerial\r\nstems possessed a fluted or stellate cylinder of mesarch xylem.\r\nThere can be no doubt as to the significance of the morphological\r\nresemblances between the Psilotales and the genera _Sphenophyllum_\r\nand _Cheirostrobus_, but the position of _Tmesipteris_ and _Psilotum_\r\nin the plant-kingdom may probably be best expressed by adopting the\r\ngroup-name Psilotales rather than by transferring the recent genera\r\nto the Sphenophyllales. One of the most striking differences between\r\nthe Psilotales and the genus _Lycopodium_ is in the form of the\r\nsporophylls and sporangia; in _Lycopodium_ a single sporophyll bears\r\na unilocular sporangium, but in the Psilotales the sporophyll may\r\nbe described as a bilobed structure homologous with a foliage-leaf,\r\nbearing a sporangiophore which consists of a short stalk terminating\r\nin a bilocular or trilocular synangium; the short stalk receives a\r\nspecial branch from the vascular bundle of the sterile portion of the\r\nsporophyll[50].\r\n\r\n\r\n            _Fossils described by authors as being closely\r\n                         allied to_ Psilotum.\r\n\r\nA search through palaeobotanical literature reveals the existence\r\nof a very small number of specimens which have been identified as\r\nrepresentatives of the Psilotales. An inspection of the material or\r\npublished drawings leads one to the conclusion that practically no\r\ninformation of a satisfactory kind is available in regard to the past\r\nhistory of the two southern genera _Psilotum_ and _Tmesipteris_, which\r\nare regarded by some botanists as relics of an ancient branch[51] of\r\npteridophytes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PSILOTITES, ETC.]\r\n\r\nIn 1842 Münster[52] instituted the genus _Psilotites_ for a small\r\nimpression of a slender branched axis from Jurassic rocks near Mannheim\r\nin Germany which he named _Psilotites filiformis_; Schimper[53]\r\nspoke of the specimens as too doubtful for determination, an opinion\r\nwith which every botanist would cordially agree. Goldenberg’s species\r\n_Psilotites lithanthracis_[54] from the Saarbrücken coal-field is\r\nfounded on impressions of axes: some of these are dichotomously\r\nbranched and bear small oval projections, which may be rudimentary\r\nleaves or possibly leaf-scars. More recently Kidston[55] described\r\nspecimens of branched axes from the Lanarkshire coal-field bearing\r\na row of lateral thorn-like projections under the title _Psilotites\r\nunilateralis_; but these fragments, as Dr Kidston himself admits, are\r\nof no botanical value.\r\n\r\nIn a paper on fossil Salvinias, Hollick[56] mentions _Salvinia\r\nreticulata_, originally described by Heer and by Ettingshausen and _S.\r\nAlleni_ Lesq.[57] a Tertiary species, and calls attention to their very\r\nclose resemblance in form, nervation, and apex to the leaves of the\r\ngenus _Tmesipteris_: he refers both species to that genus. The drawings\r\nreproduced by Hollick represent leaves with a midrib and numerous\r\nanastomosing lateral veins, whereas in _Tmesipteris_ the lamina of the\r\nleaf has a midrib without lateral branches. An enlarged drawing of the\r\noutlines of the epidermal cells would correspond closely with the small\r\nreticulations in the fossil leaves and it may be that there has been\r\nsome confusion between veins and cell-outlines. In any case there would\r\nseem to be no reason for the use of the recent generic name[58].\r\n\r\nAmong other fossils assigned to the Psilotales we have Marion’s genus\r\n_Gomphostrobus_ from the Permian of France and Germany[59]. Marion\r\nplaced this plant in the Coniferales on the strength of its resemblance\r\nto _Walchia_ and _Araucaria_, but Potonié[60] is inclined to recognise\r\nin the leaves and monospermic sporophylls characters suggestive of\r\nLycopodiaceous affinity.\r\n\r\nThe latter author in 1891[61], in ignorance of Marion’s proposal to\r\nadopt the name _Gomphostrobus_, instituted a genus _Psilotiphyllum_\r\nfor the sporophylls of a species originally described by Geinitz[62]\r\nas _Sigillariostrobus bifidus_, but he subsequently adopted Marion’s\r\ndesignation and with some hesitation included the French and German\r\nspecimens in the Psilotales. As stated elsewhere[63], Potonié’s\r\narguments in favour of his view hardly carry conviction, and it is\r\nprobably more in accordance with truth to deal with _Gomphostrobus_ in\r\nthe chapter devoted to the Coniferales.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Psilophyton._\r\n\r\nThe generic title _Psilophyton_, instituted by the late Sir\r\nWilliam Dawson[64], has become familiar to geologists as that of\r\na Pre-Carboniferous plant characteristic of Devonian and Silurian\r\nrocks in Canada, the United States of America, and Europe. From the\r\nbotanist’s point of view the name stands for miscellaneous remains\r\nof plants of different types and in many cases unworthy of record.\r\nThe genus was founded on impressions of branched axes from the\r\nDevonian strata of New Brunswick resembling the rachis and portions of\r\nlateral pinnae of ferns or the forked slender twigs of a Lycopod. The\r\ntype-species _Psilophyton princeps_ Daws. as represented on somewhat\r\nslender evidence in Dawson’s restoration, which accompanies the\r\noriginal description of the genus and has since been copied by several\r\nauthors, is characterised by the possession of a horizontal rhizome\r\nbearing numerous rootlets and giving off dichotomously branched aerial\r\nshoots with spinous appendages, compared with rudimentary leaves, and\r\nterminating in slender branchlets bearing pendulous oval “spore-cases”\r\nfrom their tips. Some of the branchlets exhibit a fern-like vernation.\r\nThe plant is spoken of by Dawson as apparently a generalised type[65],\r\nresembling in habit and in its rudimentary leaves the recent genus\r\n_Psilotum_ and presenting points of contact with ferns. Specimens were\r\nfound in an imperfectly petrified state showing a central cylinder of\r\nscalariform tracheae surrounded by a broad cortical zone of parenchyma\r\nand fibrous tissue.\r\n\r\nAmong other species described by the author of the genus we need only\r\nmention _Psilophyton robustius_, characterised by vegetative shoots\r\nand “spore-cases” similar to those of the type-species; but, as\r\nSolms-Laubach[66] has pointed out, the petrified sections referred by\r\nDawson to _P. robustius_ are of an entirely different anatomical type\r\nfrom that of _P. princeps_[67].\r\n\r\nBritish fossils from the Old Red Sandstone from the north of Scotland,\r\nOrkney and Caithness, originally figured by Hugh Miller and compared\r\nby him with algae but more especially with recent Lycopods, were\r\nsubsequently placed by Carruthers[68] in the genus _Psilophyton_ as _P.\r\nDechianum_, the specific designation being chosen on the ground that\r\nthe Scotch specimens are specifically identical with fossils described\r\nby Goeppert[69] as _Haliserites Dechianus_.\r\n\r\nVarious opinions have been expressed in regard to the nature of\r\nthe Devonian species _Haliserites Dechianus_ Goepp. with which\r\nCarruthers[70] identified Miller’s Old Red Sandstone plant: reference\r\nmay be made to a paper by White[71] containing figures of dichotomously\r\nbranched impressions described as species of _Thamnocladus_ which he\r\nincludes among the algae.\r\n\r\nIn describing some Belgian impressions of Devonian age as\r\n_Lepidodendron gaspianum_ Daws. Crépin[72] states that Carruthers has\r\ncome to regard the specimens named by him _Psilophyton Dechianum_\r\nas branches of a Lepidodendron; he also quotes Carruthers as having\r\nexpressed the opinion that the name _Psilophyton_ had been employed by\r\nDawson for two kinds of fossils, some being twigs of _Lepidodendron_\r\nwhile others, identified by Dawson as the reproductive branches of\r\nspecies of _Psilophyton_, represent the spore-cases of ferns comparable\r\nwith Stur’s genus _Rhodea_[73]. One of the examples figured by\r\nCarruthers[74] as _P. Dechianum_ from Thurso (preserved in the British\r\nMuseum, no. 52636), measuring 34 cm. in length and 8 mm. broad, bears\r\na close resemblance to a fern rhizome covered with ramental scales such\r\nas that of a species of _Davallia_. Other Belgian specimens described\r\nby Gilkinet[75] as _Lepidodendron burnotense_, like Crépin’s species,\r\nare no doubt generically identical with some of the Scotch and Canadian\r\nfossils placed in the genus _Psilophyton_, though Penhallow[76]\r\nconsiders that the species _Lycopodites Milleri_ is more correctly\r\nreferred to _Lycopodites_ than to _Psilophyton_.\r\n\r\nA more recent paper on the Geology of the Perry basin in South-eastern\r\nMaine by Smith and White[77] contains a critical summary of the\r\nliterature on _Psilophyton_ and drawings of specimens. The latter\r\nafford good examples of Pre-Carboniferous plant fragments, such as are\r\noften met with in various parts of the world, which conform in habit to\r\nthe New Brunswick specimens made by Dawson the type of his genus.\r\n\r\nAn examination of material in the Montreal Museum and of Hugh Miller’s\r\nspecimens in the Edinburgh collection leads me to share the opinion\r\nof Count Solms-Laubach that the name _Psilophyton_ has been applied\r\nto plants which should not be included under one generic title. As\r\nKidston[78] pointed out, the Canadian species _Psilophyton robustius_\r\nis not generically distinct from British and Belgian specimens\r\nreferred to _Lepidodendron_; it may possibly be identical with the\r\nBohemian plants on which Stur founded his genus _Hostinella_[79]. The\r\nDevonian plants described by Stur have since been examined by Jahn[80]\r\nwho regards them as vascular plants, and not as algae to which Stur\r\nreferred them; he mentions two species of _Psilophyton_ but gives no\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nThe “spore-cases” of Dawson may be found to be the microsporangia\r\nor perhaps the small seeds of some pteridosperm; the forked axes\r\nwith a smooth surface and others figured by Miller and by Dawson,\r\nwith the surface covered with scales suggesting the ramenta of a\r\nfern, may be the rachises or rhizomes of filicinean plants. Other\r\nspecimens may be Lepidodendron twigs, as for example the petrified\r\nfragments figured by Dawson as _Psilophyton princeps_; while the stem\r\nidentified as _P. robustius_ is most probably that of a Gymnosperm.\r\nIt is doubtful whether a useful purpose is served by retaining the\r\ngenus _Psilophyton_. It was in the first instance instituted on the\r\nassumption, which cannot be upheld, that the abundant material in the\r\nNew Brunswick beds bore a sufficiently close resemblance to the rhizome\r\nand aerial branches of _Psilotum_. _Psilophyton_ has served as a name\r\nfor miscellaneous plant fragments, many of which are indeterminable. Dr\r\nWhite concludes his account of the genus with the following words[81]:\r\n\r\n“The examination of such so-called Psilophyton material as I have seen\r\nshows the existence in America of two or more groups, represented\r\nby several fairly well-marked species which possess stratigraphical\r\nvalue, and which should be carefully diagnosed and illustrated. It is\r\nprobable also that additional material throwing light on the structure\r\nand relationships of these very remarkable early types of land-plants\r\nwill be discovered at some locality. The inspection of the material in\r\nhand emphasises the need, as was pointed out by Solms-Laubach, for the\r\nrevision of the material referred by various authors to _Psilophyton_,\r\ntogether with a thorough re-examination and re-publication of the\r\ntypes.”\r\n\r\nUntil a thorough re-examination has been made of the Canadian material,\r\nwith a view to determine whether there exist substantial reasons for\r\nthe retention of Dawson’s genus, it is undesirable to continue to make\r\nuse of this name for Pre-Carboniferous fossils which are too incomplete\r\nto be assigned with certainty to a definite group of plants. Dr White\r\ndraws attention to the similarity of some of the Perry basin specimens\r\nto Nathorst’s genus _Cephalotheca_[82] from Devonian rocks of Bear\r\nIsland in the Arctic regions, a comparison which might be extended to\r\nother genera and which serves to illustrate the possibility that many\r\nof the specimens labelled _Psilophyton_ may eventually be recognised as\r\nexamples of well defined generic types belonging to more than one group\r\nof plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n                             LYCOPODIALES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recent members of the Lycopodiales are considered apart from\r\nthe extinct genera in order that our examination of the latter may\r\nbe facilitated by a knowledge of the salient characteristics of the\r\nsurviving types of this important section of the Pteridophyta. A\r\ngeneral acquaintance with the extinct as well as with the recent genera\r\nwill enable us to appreciate the contrasts between the living and the\r\nfossil forms and to realise the prominent position occupied by this\r\ngroup in the Palaeozoic period, a position in striking contrast to\r\nthe part played by the diminutive survivors in the vegetation of the\r\npresent day. In the account of the recent genera special attention is\r\ndrawn to such features as afford a clue to the interpretation of the\r\nfossils, and the point of view adopted, which at times may appear to\r\nlead to an excessive attention to details, is necessarily somewhat\r\ndifferent from that represented in botanical text-books[83].\r\n\r\n                           A. =HOMOSPOREAE.=\r\n\r\n        =Lycopodiaceae=: genera _Phylloglossum_, _Lycopodium_.\r\n\r\n                          B. =HETEROSPOREAE.=\r\n\r\n                =Selaginellaceae=: genus _Selaginella_.\r\n                =Isoetaceae=: genus _Isoetes_.\r\n\r\nThe existing plants included in the Lycopodiales are in nearly all\r\ncases perennial herbaceous pteridophytes, exhibiting in their\r\nlife-histories a well marked alternation of generations. The sporophyte\r\n(asexual generation) is characterised by the relatively small size\r\nof the leaves except in the genus _Isoetes_ (fig. 132) and in the\r\nAustralian and New Zealand genus _Phylloglossum_. The stems are usually\r\nerect or trailing, pendulous in epiphytic species or small and tuberous\r\nin _Isoetes_ and _Phylloglossum_. The repeated forking of the shoots\r\n(monopodial and dichotomous branching) is a prominent feature of the\r\ngroup. The vascular tissue of the stem usually assumes the form of a\r\nsingle axial strand (stele) (fig. 125), but the shoots of some species\r\nof _Selaginella_ often contain two or more distinct steles (fig. 131).\r\nThe group as a whole is characterised by the centripetal development of\r\nthe xylem composed almost entirely of scalariform tracheids: secondary\r\nxylem and phloem of a peculiar type occur in _Isoetes_, and the\r\nproduction of secondary xylem elements in a very slight degree has been\r\nnoticed in one species of _Selaginella_ (_S. spinosa_)[84]. The roots\r\nare constructed on a simple plan, having in most cases only one strand\r\nof spiral protoxylem elements (monarch structure). In _Lycopodium_,\r\nin which stem and root anatomy are more nearly of the same type than\r\nin the majority of plants, several protoxylem strands may be present.\r\nThe sporangia are axillary or, more frequently, borne on the upper\r\nsurface of sporophylls, which are either identical with or more or less\r\ndistinct from the foliage leaves; in the latter case the sporophylls\r\noften occur in the form of a well defined strobilus (cone) at the tips\r\nof branches.\r\n\r\nThe gametophyte (sexual generation) is represented by prothalli which,\r\nin the homosporous genera, may live underground as saprophytes, or the\r\nupper portion may develop chlorophyll and project above the surface of\r\nthe ground as an irregularly lobed green structure (_e.g._ _Lycopodium\r\ncernuum_)[85]. In the heterosporous forms the prothalli are much\r\nreduced and do not lead an independent existence outside the spore by\r\nthe membrane of which they are always more or less enclosed. The sexual\r\norgans are represented by antheridia and archegonia; the male cells\r\nare provided with two cilia except in _Isoetes_ which has multiciliate\r\nantherozoids like those of the ferns.\r\n\r\nThe existing Lycopods, though widely distributed, never grow in\r\nsufficiently dense masses to the exclusion of other plants to form a\r\nconspicuous feature in the vegetation of a country. The inconspicuous\r\nrôle which they play among the plant-associations of the present era\r\naffords a striking contrast to the abundance of the arborescent species\r\nin the Palaeozoic forests of the northern hemisphere.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\n=Lycopodiaceae.= _Lycopodium_, represented by nearly 100 species,\r\nforms a constituent of most floras: epiphytic species predominate in\r\ntropical regions, while others flourish on the mountains and moorlands\r\nof Britain and in other extra-tropical countries. For the most part\r\n_Lycopodium_ exhibits a preference for a moist climate and appears to\r\nbe well adapted to habitats where the amount of sunlight is relatively\r\nsmall and the conditions of life unfavourable for dense vegetation.\r\nMountains and islands constantly recur as situations from which species\r\nhave been recorded. Some species are essentially swamp-plants, _e.g._\r\n_Lycopodium inundatum_, a British species, and _L. cruentum_ from\r\nthe marshes of Sierra Nevada. A variety of the American species, _L.\r\nalopecuroides_ (var. _aquaticum_) affords an instance of a submerged\r\nform, which has been collected from an altitude of 12–14,000 ft. on the\r\nAndes and Himalayas. It is noteworthy that a considerable variety of\r\nhabitats is represented within the limits of the genus and that many\r\nspecies are sufficiently hardy to exist in circumstances which would be\r\nintolerable to the majority of flowering plants[86].\r\n\r\nThe British species frequently spoken of as Club Mosses, include\r\n_Lycopodium Selago_, _L. annotinum_, _L. clavatum_, _L. alpinum_, and\r\n_L. inundatum_.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\n=Selaginellaceae.= The species of _Selaginella_, over 300 in number,\r\nare widely spread in tropical and subtropical forests, growing on the\r\nground with trailing, suberect or erect stems climbing over taller and\r\nstouter plants or as pendulous epiphytes on forest trees.\r\n\r\n_Selaginella lepidophylla_, a tropical American type, popularly known\r\nas the Resurrection plant, and often erroneously spoken of as the Rose\r\nof Jericho[87], possesses the power of rolling up its shoots during\r\nperiods of drought and furnishes an example of a species adapted to\r\nconditions in marked contrast to those which are most favourable to the\r\nmajority of species.\r\n\r\nThe only British species is _Selaginella spinosa_ named by Linnaeus\r\n_Lycopodium selaginoides_ and occasionally referred to as _Selaginella\r\nspinulosa_ A. Br. (not to be confounded with a Javan species _S.\r\nspinulosa_ Spring[88]).\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\n=Isoetaceae.= _Isoetes_ (fig. 132), of which Mr Baker in his _Handbook\r\nof the Fern-Allies_ enumerates 49 species, is a type apart, differing\r\nin habit as in certain other characters from the other members of the\r\nLycopodiales. Some botanists[89] prefer to include the genus among the\r\nFilicales, but the balance of evidence, including resemblances between\r\n_Isoetes_ and extinct Lycopodiaceous plants, would seem to favour its\r\nretention as an aberrant genus of the group Lycopodiales. Some species\r\nare permanently submerged, others occur in situations intermittently\r\ncovered with water, and a few grow in damp soil. _Isoetes lacustris_\r\nis found in mountain tarns and lakes of Britain and elsewhere in\r\nCentral and Northern Europe and North America. _Isoetes hystrix_[90], a\r\nland-form occurs in Guernsey, North-East France, Spain and Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Lycopodiaceae.\r\n\r\nThe monotypic genus _Phylloglossum_, represented by _P. Drummondii_ of\r\nAustralia and New Zealand, though interesting from the point of view of\r\nits probable claim to be considered the most primitive type of existing\r\nLycopodiaceous plants, need not be dealt with in detail. A complete\r\nindividual, which does not exceed 4 or 5 cm. in length, consists of a\r\nvery small tubercle or protocorm bearing a rosette of slender subulate\r\nleaves and prolonged distally as a simple naked axis which overtops the\r\nfoliage leaves and terminates in a compact cluster of small scale-like\r\nsporophylls, each subtending a single sporangium[91].\r\n\r\n_Lycopodium._ It would be out of place in a volume devoted mainly\r\nto fossil plants to attempt a comprehensive account of the general\r\nmorphology of recent species, and indeed our knowledge of the\r\nanatomical characters of the genus is still somewhat meagre. For\r\npurposes of comparison with extinct types, it is essential that some of\r\nthe more important morphological features of existing species should\r\nbe briefly considered. The additions made to our knowledge of the\r\ngameophyte[92] of European and tropical species during the last two\r\ndecades have revealed a striking diversity in habit.\r\n\r\nIn several species, grouped round the widely distributed type\r\n_Lycopodium Selago_ Linn., the comparatively short, erect or suberect,\r\nshoots form fairly compact tufts; the ordinary foliage-leaves function\r\nas sporophylls, and the sporangia are not localised on special portions\r\nof shoots. From this type, we pass to others in which the fertile\r\nleaves tend to be confined to the tips of branches, but hardly differ\r\nin form from the sterile. A further degree of specialisation is\r\nexhibited by species with well-defined cones composed of leaves (or\r\nbracts), the primary function of which is to bear sporangia and to\r\nafford a protective covering to the strobilus[93].\r\n\r\n_Lycopodium rufescens_ Hook. An Andian species with stout dichotomously\r\nbranched erect stems bears on the younger shoots crowded leaves with\r\ntheir thick and broadly triangular laminae pointing upwards, but on the\r\nolder and thick shoots the laminae are strongly reflexed (fig. 121,\r\nA). The lower part of the specimen represented in fig. 121, A, shows\r\ntangentially elongated scars and persistent leaf-bases or cushions left\r\non the stem after the removal of the free portions of the leathery\r\nleaves, a surface-feature which also characterises the Palaeozoic genus\r\n_Lepidodendron_. The reflexed leaves and persistent leaf-cushions are\r\nclearly seen in the piece of old stem of _Lycopodium dichotomum_ Jacq.,\r\na tropical American species reproduced in fig. 121, B. Such species\r\nas _L. erythraeum_ Spring, and others with stiff lanceolate leaves\r\nexhibit a striking resemblance to the more slender shoots of some\r\nrecent conifers, more especially _Araucaria excelsa_, _A. Balansae_,\r\n_Cryptomeria_, _Dacrydium_ and other genera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121. _Lycopodium._\r\n\r\n  A. _Lycopodium rufescens._\r\n  B. _L. dichotomum._\r\n  C. _L. tetragonum._\r\n  D. _L. nummularifolium._\r\n  E. _L.

(fig. 122) a tropical species from India,\r\nPolynesia, and other regions, is characterised by its stout stems\r\nreaching a diameter of 2·5 cm., bearing long pendulous branches with\r\nlarge terminal cones composed of sporophylls differing but slightly\r\nfrom the foliage leaves. The plant represented in the photograph serves\r\nas a good illustration of the practical identity in habit between\r\nPalaeozoic and recent genera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 124. _Lycopodium obscurum._]\r\n\r\n_L. Dalhousianum_ Spring, from the mountains of the Malay Peninsula\r\nand Borneo, has larger leaves of finer texture with a distinct midrib\r\nreaching a length of 2–3 cm. (fig. 121, E). Another type is illustrated\r\nby _L. nummularifolium_ Blume, also a Malayan species, in which the\r\nleaves are shorter, broadly oblong or suborbicular, and the branches\r\nterminate in narrow and often very long strobili (sometimes reaching\r\na length of 30 cm.) with small bracts in striking contrast to the\r\nfoliage leaves (fig. 121, D). A similar form of long and slender\r\nstrobilus occurs in _L. Phlegmaria_ Linn., a common tropical Lycopod:\r\nthe frequent forking of the strobili noticed in this and other species\r\nis a character not unknown among fossil cones (_Lepidostrobi_).\r\n\r\n_L. cernuum_ Linn. (fig. 123), another widely spread tropical type,\r\noffers an even closer resemblance than _L. squarrosum_ to the fossil\r\nLepidodendra. The stiff erect stem, reaching in some cases a length\r\nof several feet, bears numerous repeatedly forked branches, with\r\ncrowded linear leaves, terminating in short cylindrical cones with\r\nbroadly ovate sporophylls. A similar habit characterises the North\r\nAmerican species _L. obscurum_ Linn. (fig. 124) bearing cones several\r\ncentimetres in length.\r\n\r\n_L. casuarinoides_ Spring (fig. 121, F) an eastern tropical species,\r\nis worthy of notice as exhibiting a peculiar form of leaf consisting\r\nof a very small lamina, 3 mm. in length, borne on the top of a long\r\ndecurrent base, which forms a narrow type of leaf-cushion, bearing\r\nsome resemblance to the long and rib-like cushions of certain species\r\nof _Sigillaria_, and recalling the habit of slender fossil twigs\r\nreferred to the Coniferae under such names as _Widdringtonites_,\r\n_Cyparissidium_, _Sphenolepidium_.\r\n\r\n_L. volubile_ Forst. (fig. 121, G) a New Zealand species, in habit\r\nand leaf-form bears a close resemblance to the Jurassic _Lycopodites\r\nfalcatus_ Lind. and Hutt. (fig. 137): it is also a representative of a\r\nfew species of _Lycopodium_ which agree with the majority of species of\r\n_Selaginella_ in having two kinds of sterile leaves, comparatively long\r\nfalcate leaves forming two lateral rows and smaller appressed leaves on\r\nthe upper surface of the branches.\r\n\r\nThese examples suffice to illustrate the general appearance presented\r\nby the vegetative shoots of recent species of which the foliage\r\nleaves vary considerably—from the small scale-leaves of _Lycopodium\r\ntetragonum_, to the very slender linear subulate leaves of such a\r\nspecies as _L. verticillatum_ Linn. or the long and broader lamina of\r\n_L. Dalhousianum_ (fig. 121, E). It is obvious that fragments of the\r\nvarious types preserved as fossils might well be mistaken either for\r\nsome of the larger mosses or for twigs of conifers. As Dr Bommer[94]\r\nhas pointed out in his interesting paper on “Les causes d’erreur dans\r\nl’étude des empreintes végétales” some dicotyledonous plants may also\r\nsimulate the habit of Lycopods: he cites _Phyllachne clavigera_ Hook\r\n(Candolleaceae), _Tafalla graveolens_ Wedd (Compositae) and _Lavoisiera\r\nlycopodioides_ Gard. (Melastomataceae). Another point illustrated\r\nby fig. 121 is the close agreement in habit and in the form of the\r\nleaves and leaf-cushions between the recent plants and the Palaeozoic\r\nLepidodendreae.\r\n\r\nIn his masterly essay “On the vegetation of the Carboniferous Period,\r\nas compared with that of the present day” Sir Joseph Hooker called\r\nattention to the variation in the shape and arrangement of the\r\nleaves in the same species of _Lycopodium_. The three woodcuts which\r\nhe publishes of _Lycopodium densum_, a New Zealand species, afford\r\nstriking examples of the diversity in habit and leaf-form and justify\r\nhis warning “that if the species of _Lepidodendron_ were as prone to\r\nvary in the foliage as are those of _Lycopodium_, our available means\r\nfor distinguishing them are wholly insufficient[95].”\r\n\r\nAs we have already noticed, there is a considerable diversity among\r\nrecent species, both as regards habitat and habit; in the anatomy\r\nof the stem also corresponding variations occur within the limits\r\nof a well-defined generic type of stele. In species with creeping\r\nstems, such as _L. clavatum_[96], the stele exhibits an arrangement\r\nof vascular tissue characteristic of the plagiotropic forms. The\r\nxylem consists of more or less horizontal plates of scalariform\r\ntracheae, each surrounded by small-celled parenchyma, alternating with\r\nbands or groups of somewhat ill-defined phloem. The protoxylem and\r\nprotophloem elements occupy an external position (exarch), pointing\r\nto a centripetal development of the metaxylem. This centripetal or\r\nroot-like character of the primary xylem is an important feature in\r\nrecent as in fossil Lycopods. The close agreement between the roots and\r\nstems of recent species in the disposition of the vascular elements\r\nalso denotes a simpler type of anatomy than occurs in the majority of\r\nvascular plants in which stem and root have more pronounced structural\r\npeculiarities. A pericycle, 2–6 cells in breadth, encloses the xylem\r\nand phloem bands and this is succeeded by an endodermis, 2–3 cells\r\nbroad, with vaguely defined limits. In _L. clavatum_, as in _L.\r\nalpinum_, another British species, the broad cortex is differentiated\r\ninto three fairly distinct regions; abutting on the endodermis is a\r\nzone several layers broad of thick-walled cells constituting an inner\r\ncortex modified for protection and support; the central region consists\r\nof larger and thinner-walled cells adapted for water-storage and\r\naeration; beyond this is an outer cortical zone of firmer and thicker\r\nelements. The prominent leaf-bases or leaf-cushions (fig. 125, A, _lc_)\r\ngive to the surface of a transverse section a characteristic appearance\r\nwhich presents the closest agreement with that of the younger shoots of\r\n_Lepidodendron_. From the peripheral protoxylem groups small strands of\r\nxylem are given off, which follow a steeply ascending course through\r\nthe cortex to the single-veined leaves. The leaf-traces, in several\r\nspecies at least, are characterised by a mesarch structure (fig. 125,\r\nF, G), the spiral protoxylem elements occupying an approximately\r\ncentral position. The mesophyll of the leaves varies in regard to the\r\nextent of differentiation into a palisade and spongy parenchyma; in all\r\ncases there is a single vascular bundle occasionally accompanied by a\r\nsecretory duct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 125.\r\n\r\n  A. _Lycopodium dichotomum._ Transverse section of stem: _lc_,\r\n     leaf-cushion; _lt_, leaf-trace; R, roots.\r\n  B. _L. cernuum_, portion of cortex of fig.

Dalhousianum_, _L. squarrosum_ (fig. 122) and\r\nmany others, the stele presents a characteristic appearance due to the\r\nxylem plates being broken up into detached groups or short uniseriate\r\nbands with the interspaces occupied by phloem islands. This type of\r\nstructure bears a superficial resemblance to that in the single stele\r\nof certain species of the fern _Lygodium_[97], but it is distinguished\r\nby the islands of phloem scattered through the stele. In other species\r\nthe xylem tends to assume the form of a Maltese cross (_e.g._ _L.\r\nserratum_ Thbg.) or it may be disposed as =V=-shaped and sinuous bands\r\nterminating in broad truncate ends composed of protoxylem elements.\r\nThis form of the xylem and the distribution of the phloem groups are\r\nshown in fig. 125, D, E, drawn from a section of a plant of _Lycopodium\r\nsaururus_ Lam.[98] collected by Mr A. W. Hill at an altitude of 15,000\r\nfeet on the Andes of Peru. The position of the protoxylem is shown fig.\r\n125, E, _px_.\r\n\r\nWhile several species possess a cortex of three distinct zones (fig.\r\n125, H, _c_, _c_′, _c_″), in others the extra-stelar tissue is much\r\nmore homogeneous, consisting of thin-walled parenchyma or in some\r\ncases of thick-walled elements; as a general rule, however, there\r\nis a tendency towards a more compact arrangement in the inner and\r\nouter portions of the cortex as contrasted with the larger and more\r\nloosely connected cells of the middle region. In certain types the\r\nmiddle cortex contains fairly large spaces, as in the swamp-species\r\n_L. inundatum_, which with _L. alopecuroides_ exhibits another feature\r\nof some interest first described by Hegelmaier[99]. If a transverse\r\nsection of the stem of _L. inundatum_ be examined the leaf-traces are\r\nseen to be accompanied by a circular canal containing mucilage which\r\nextends into the lamina of the leaf. In a specimen of _L. cernuum_[100]\r\nobtained at a height of 2500 ft. by Professor Stanley Gardiner in\r\nthe Fiji Islands, the leaf-traces (fig. 125, B _lt_) were found to\r\nbe accompanied for part of their course by a well-marked secretory\r\nspace (fig. 125, B, _s_). There is little doubt that the presence of\r\nthese mucilage canals is directly connected with a certain type of\r\nhabitat[101] and attention is called to them in view of a resemblance\r\nwhich they offer to a characteristic strand of tissue, known as the\r\nparichnos, which is associated with the leaf-traces of _Lepidodendreae_\r\nand _Sigillarieae_. In the section shown in fig. 125, H, the xylem of\r\nthe stele forms more continuous bands than is often the case in _L.\r\ncernuum_ which has already been described as having its xylem in small\r\ndetached groups. The presence of the smaller branch-stele (fig. 125, H,\r\n_b_) affords an example of monopodial branching. The outer cortex of\r\n_L. saururus_ (fig. 125, C) exhibits a somewhat unusual feature in the\r\ndistribution of the thicker-walled tissue (_b_) which encloses a patch\r\nof more delicate parenchyma (_a_) with large lacunae (_lc_) in the\r\nregion of the leaf-bases, and presents the appearance of an irregular\r\nreticulum. This arrangement of the mechanical tissue in the outer\r\ncortex is comparable with that in stems of some species of _Sigillaria_.\r\n\r\nIn certain species of _Lycopodium_ the roots[102], which arise\r\nendogenously from the axial vascular cylinder, instead of passing\r\nthrough the cortex of the stem by the shortest route, bend downwards\r\nand bore their way in a more or less vertical direction before emerging\r\nat or near the base of the aerial shoot. The transverse section of _L.\r\ndichotomum_ represented in fig. 125, A, shows several roots (R) in the\r\ncortex; they consist of a xylem strand of circular or crescentric form\r\naccompanied by phloem and enclosed by several layers of root-cortex.\r\nThe roots of _Lycopodium_ do not always present so simple a structure\r\nas those of _L. dichotomum_; the xylem may have an irregularly stellate\r\nform with as many as ten protoxylem groups.\r\n\r\n_Reproductive Shoots[103]._ In _Lycopodium Selago_ the foliage\r\nleaves serve also as sporophylls and, as Professor Bower[104] has\r\npointed out, the branches exhibit to some extent a zonal alternation\r\nof sterile and fertile leaves; in other species, in which foliage\r\nleaves and sporophylls are practically identical, the sporangia occur\r\nsporadically on the ordinary leaves. In species with well-defined\r\nterminal cones the lower sporophylls may bear arrested sporangia and\r\nthus form transitional stages between sterile and fertile leaves, a\r\nfeature which occurs also in the male and female flowers of many recent\r\nAraucarieae[105]. The sporangia[106] (fig. 126, D, F) are usually\r\nreniform and compressed in a direction parallel to the surface of the\r\ncone-scales; they are developed from the upper surface and close to\r\nthe base of the fertile leaf to which they are attached by a short and\r\nthick stalk (_e.g._ _L. inundatum_) or by a longer and more slender\r\npedicel (_L. Phlegmaria_, fig. 126, E). On maturity the sporangia open\r\nas two valves in the plane of compression and the line of dehiscence\r\nis determined in some species at least by the occurrence of smaller\r\ncells in the wall. In transverse sections of cones in which the\r\nsporangia are strongly saddle-shaped, the sporophylls may appear to\r\nbear two sporangia. This is well shown in the section of a cone of\r\n_L. clavatum_ shown in fig. 126, F. The sporangia _a_ and _b_ are cut\r\nthrough in an approximately median plane showing the irregular outline\r\nof the sterile pad (_p_) of tissue in the sporogenous cavity. Those\r\nat _c_ and _d_ have been traversed at a lower level and the two lobes\r\nof the saddle-shaped sporangia are cut below the attachment to the\r\nsporophyll. The distal laminae of the sporophylls, cut at different\r\nlevels, are seen at the periphery of the cone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 126.\r\n\r\n  A. _Lycopodium cernuum_, longitudinal section of strobilus; _a_,\r\n     band of lignified cells.\r\n  B. _L. cernuum._ Cell from sporangium wall.\r\n  C. _L. cernuum._ Sporophyll and sporangium; _lt_, vascular bundle.\r\n  D. _L. clavatum._ Part of radial longitudinal section of strobilus;\r\n     _p_, sterile tissue.\r\n  E. _L. Phlegmaria._ Sporophyll and stalked sporangium.\r\n  F. _L. clavatum._ Transverse section of strobilus; _p_, sterile pad.]\r\n\r\nIn longitudinal radial section of some cones the sporangia appear to\r\noccupy an axillary position, but in others (_e.g._ _L. clavatum_)\r\nthey are attached to the horizontal portion of the sporophyll almost\r\nmidway between the axis of the cone and the upturned distal end of the\r\nsporophyll (fig. 126, D). The wall of a sporangium frequently consists\r\nof 2–3 cell-layers and in some cases (_e.g._ _L. dichotomum_), it may\r\nreach a thickness of seven layers, resembling in this respect the\r\nmore bulky sporangia of a certain type of Lepidodendroid cone. The\r\nsporogenous tissue is separated from the stalk of the sporangium by\r\na mass of parenchymatous tissue which may project as a prominent pad\r\n(fig. 126, D, F, _p_) into the interior of the sporogenous cavity. This\r\nbasal tissue (the subarchesporial pad of Bower[107]) has been observed\r\nin _L. clavatum_ to send up irregular processes of sterile cells among\r\nthe developing spores, suggesting a comparison with the trabeculae\r\nwhich form a characteristic feature of the sporangia of _Isoetes_ and\r\nwith similar sterile strands noticed by Bower[108] in _Lepidostrobus_\r\n(cone of _Lepidodendron_).\r\n\r\nEach sporophyll is supplied by a single vascular bundle which according\r\nto published statements never sends a branch to the sporangium base.\r\nThe fertile tips of the foliage shoots of _L. cernuum_ (figs. 126, A–C)\r\nafford good examples of specialised cones. The surface of the cone is\r\ncovered by the broadly triangular laminae of sporophylls (fig. 126, C)\r\nwhich in their fimbriate margins resemble the Palaeozoic cone-scales\r\ndescribed by Dr Kidston[109] as _Lepidostrobus fimbriatus_. The distal\r\nportions of the sporophylls are prolonged downwards (fig. 126, A)\r\nto afford protection to the lower sporangia, their efficiency being\r\nincreased by the lignified and thicker walls (A, _a_) of the cells in\r\nthe lower portion of the laminar expansion. The cells of the sporangial\r\nwall are provided with strengthening bands which in surface-view\r\n(fig. 126, B) present the appearance of prominent pegs. Since the\r\nappearance of Miss Sykes’s paper on the sporangium-bearing organs of\r\nthe Lycopodiaceae, Dr Lang[110] has published a more complete account\r\nof the structure of the strobilus of _Lycopodium cernuum_ in which he\r\nrecords certain features of special interest. The importance of these\r\nmorphological characters is increased by their agreement, as shown\r\nby Lang, with those of the Palaeozoic cone _Spencerites_[111]. The\r\nsporophylls of a cone (12 mm. long by 3 mm. in diameter) of _Lycopodium\r\ncernuum_ show an abrupt transition from the foliage leaves, but like\r\nthese they occur in alternate whorls of five. A large sporangium is\r\nattached to the upper face of each sporophyll close to the base of\r\nthe obliquely vertical distal lamina (fig. 127); each sporophyll,\r\nwhich is supplied with a single vascular bundle, has a large\r\nmucilage-cavity (_m_) in its lower region. “The mucilaginous change”\r\nin the sub-sporangial portion of a sporophyll “extends to the surface\r\ninvolving the epidermis, so that this portion of the sporophyll-base\r\nmay be described as consisting of a mass of mucilage bounded below by\r\na structureless membrane[112].” Dehiscence of the sporangia occurs at\r\nthe middle of the distal face (fig. 127, _x_). As seen in the radial\r\nsection (fig. 127, _ma_) the outer margin of the base of the sporophyll\r\nbears a short outgrowth. The leaf-bases of each whorl hang down between\r\nthe sporangia of the alternating whorl below, and the base of each\r\nsporophyll is coherent with the margins of the two sporophylls of\r\nthe next lower whorl between which it lies, the sporangia being thus\r\nclosely packed and lying in a pocket “open only on the outer surface\r\nof the cone.” Fig. 128 represents a transverse section through a cone\r\nin the plane AA of fig. 127; this traverses the sporangia and their\r\nsubtending bracts (_b_) of one whorl and the dependent bases of the\r\nsporophylls of the next higher whorl in the region of the mucilage-sacs\r\n(_m_), which are bounded at the periphery by the outer tissue of the\r\nsporophylls (_a_). A transverse section in the plane BB of fig. 127\r\nis shown in fig. 129: the pedicels and a part of each vascular strand\r\nare seen at _b_ radiating from the axis of the cone; one sporophyll\r\n(_sp, a_) is cut through in the region of the pad of tracheal tissue\r\nthat characterises the short sporangial stalks. The upper portions of\r\nthe sporangia of the next lower whorl, which project upwards against\r\nthe mucilaginous bases of the sporophylls above (cf. fig. 127, BB) are\r\nshown at _c_ and external to them, at _a_, the section has cut through\r\nthe outer persistent portions of these sporophyll bases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 127. Radial longitudinal section of the cone of\r\n  _Lycopodium cernuum_. (After Lang.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 128. Transverse section of the cone of _Lycopodium\r\n  cernuum_, in its plane AA of fig. 127. (After Lang.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 129. Transverse section of the cone of _Lycopodium\r\n  cernuum_ in the plane BB of fig. 127. (After Lang.)]\r\n\r\nAs Lang points out, this highly complex structure is an expression of\r\nthe complete protection afforded to the sporangia of a plant met with\r\nin exposed situations in the tropics; it is also of importance from a\r\nmorphological standpoint as exhibiting an agreement with the extinct\r\ntype of Lycopod cone represented by _Spencerites_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          =Selaginellaceae.=\r\n\r\n_Selaginella_ differs from _Lycopodium_ in the production of two kinds\r\nof spores, megaspores and microspores, and, in the great majority\r\nof species, in the dimorphic character of the foliage leaves, which\r\nare usually arranged in four rows, the laminae of the upper rows\r\nbeing very much smaller than those of the lower (fig. 130, 1–3). The\r\nsmaller leaves are shown more clearly in fig. 130, 1_a_. It is obvious\r\nfrom an examination of a Selaginella shoot, such as is shown in fig.\r\n130, that in fossil specimens it would often be almost impossible to\r\nrecognise the existence of two kinds of leaves. Some species, _e.g._\r\n_Selaginella spinosa_[113], the sole British representative of the\r\ngenus, are homophyllous and agree in this respect with most species\r\nof _Lycopodium_. Another feature characteristic of _Selaginella_, as\r\ncontrasted with _Lycopodium_, is the presence of a ligule in both\r\nfoliage leaves and sporophylls. This is a colourless thin lamina\r\nattached by a comparatively stout foot to the base of a pit on the\r\nupper surface and close to the lower edge of the leaf (fig. 130, 4,\r\n_l_; fig. 131, E, F, _l_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 130. _Selaginella grandis._ (1–3, nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nIn an erect species, such as _S. grandis_ Moore[114] (fig. 130 and\r\nfig. 131, G) from Borneo, the main shoots, which may attain a height\r\nof 2–3 feet, bear small and inconspicuous leaves of one kind, but the\r\nlateral and repeatedly forked shoots are heterophyllous. The passage\r\nfrom the homophyllous to the heterophyllous arrangement is shown in\r\nthe transition from the erect to the dorsiventral habit of the lateral\r\nshoots (fig. 130, 2). The monopodially or dichotomously branched shoots\r\nproduce long naked axes at the forks; these grow downwards to the\r\nground where they develop numerous dichotomously forked branches. For\r\ncertain reasons these naked aerial axes were named rhizophores and have\r\nalways been styled shoots, the term root being restricted to repeatedly\r\nforked branches which the rhizophores produce in the soil. It has,\r\nhowever, been shown by Professor Harvey-Gibson[115] that there is no\r\nsufficient reason for drawing any morphological distinction between\r\nrhizophores and roots, the term root being applicable to both.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the anatomy of _Selaginella_, thanks chiefly to the\r\nresearches of Harvey-Gibson[116], is much more complete than in the\r\ncase of _Lycopodium_. The stems, which may be either trailing or erect,\r\nare usually dorsiventral, and it is noteworthy that different shoots of\r\nthe same plant or even the same axis in different regions may exhibit\r\nconsiderable variation in the structure and arrangement of the vascular\r\ntissue. In the well-known species, _Selaginella Martensii_, the\r\nstem, which is partly trailing, partly ascending, possesses a single\r\nribbon-shaped stele composed of scalariform tracheids with two marginal\r\nprotoxylems formed by the fusion of the leaf-traces of the dorsal\r\nand ventral leaves respectively. As in _Lycopodium_ the metaxylem\r\ntracheae are as a rule scalariform, but reticulate xylem elements are\r\nby no means unknown. The tracheal band, surrounded by parenchymatous\r\nelements, is enclosed by phloem with external protophloem elements.\r\nThe characteristic features of the stele are shown in the diagrammatic\r\ndrawing of a section of another species—_S. Willdenowii_—represented in\r\nfig. 131, A.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 131.\r\n\r\n  A. _Selaginella Willdenowii._ Transverse section of stem: _a_,\r\n     outer cortex; _p_, phloem; _t_, trabeculae.\r\n  B. _S. spinosa_, stem: _px_, protoxylem.\r\n  C. _S. laevigata_ var. _Lyallii_, section of stele: _t_, ridge of\r\n     xylem cylinder; _e_, endodermis.\r\n  D. _S. rupestris_, seedlings with cotyledons (_c_) protruding\r\n     beyond the sporophylls (_b_).\r\n  E.

The trabeculae consist in part of\r\nendodermal cells characterised by cuticular bands. The cortex is\r\nusually differentiated into three fairly distinct regions. Mechanical\r\ntissue of thick-walled fibres constitutes the outer region (_a_); the\r\nmiddle cortex consists of thinner-walled parenchyma, the elements of\r\nwhich become smaller and rather more compactly arranged in the inner\r\nzone. The middle cortex is frequently characterised by the presence\r\nof spaces and by the hyphal or trabecular structure of the tissue, a\r\nfeature which, as Bower[117] pointed out, is common to many recent\r\nand fossil members of the Lycopodiales. In some cases, _e.g._ _S.\r\nerythropus_, from tropical America, the cortex of the creeping stem\r\nconsists entirely of thick-walled cells. _Selaginella grandis_ (fig.\r\n130) has “a short decumbent stem rooted at close intervals[118],”\r\nfrom which thick erect aerial shoots rise to a height of one foot or\r\nmore. In the apical region these erect axes give off repeatedly forked\r\nfoliage shoots on which the spiral phyllotaxis of the homophyllous axis\r\nis gradually replaced by four rows of two kinds of leaves (fig. 130,\r\n2). The anatomy of this species agrees with that of _S. Martensii_.\r\nThe trailing or semi-erect and homophyllous shoots of _Selaginella\r\nspinosa_[119] present a distinct type of vascular anatomy. The upper\r\npart of the ascending stem has an axial strand of xylem with seven\r\nperipheral groups of spiral protoxylem tracheae (fig. 131, B); in\r\nthe trailing portion of the shoot the protoxylem elements occur as\r\none central group in the solid rod of metaxylem through which the\r\nleaf-traces pass on their way to the axial protoxylem. This type is\r\nimportant as affording an exception, in the endarch structure of the\r\nxylem, to the usual exarch plan of the stelar tissues. This species is\r\nthe only one in which any indication of the production of secondary\r\nxylem elements has so far been recorded. Bruchmann[120] has shown\r\nthat, in the small tuberous swelling which occurs at the base of the\r\nyoung shoot (hypocotyl), a meristematic zone is formed round the axial\r\nvascular strand and by its activity a few secondary tracheids are added\r\nto the primary xylem. With this exception _Selaginella_ appears to\r\nhave lost the power of secondary thickening, the possession of which\r\nconstitutes so striking a feature of the Palaeozoic Lycopods. Another\r\ntype is represented by _S. inaequalifolia_, an Indian species, the\r\nshoots of which may have either a single stele or as many as five,\r\neach in its separate lacuna. The homophyllous _S. laevigata_ var.\r\n_Lyallii_ Spr., a Madagascan species, affords a further illustration\r\nof the variation in plan of the vascular tissues within the genus.\r\nThere is a considerable difference in structure between the erect\r\nand creeping shoots; in the former there may be as many as 12–13\r\nsteles, which gradually coalesce before the vertical axis joins the\r\ncreeping rhizome to form one central and four peripheral steles. In the\r\nrhizome there is usually a distinct axial stele without protoxylem,\r\nsurrounded by an ill-defined lacuna and enclosed by a cylindrical\r\nstele (solenostele)[121] usually two tracheae in width with four\r\nprotoxylem strands on its outer edge. The continuity of the tubular\r\nstele is broken and, in transverse section, it assumes the form of a\r\nhorse-shoe close to the base of an erect shoot to which a crescentic\r\nvascular strand is given off. Harvey-Gibson[122] has figured a section\r\nof the rhizome of this type in which the axial vascular strand is\r\nrepresented by a slight ridge of tracheae (fig. 131, C, _t_) projecting\r\ntowards the centre of the axis of the tubular stele. The cylindrical\r\nstele consists of xylem with external and internal phloem (_p_):\r\ncuticularised endodermal cells occur at _e_ and _e_.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the descending naked branches\r\ngiven off from the points of ramification of the foliage shoots of\r\n_Selaginella_. It has been shown by Harvey-Gibson[123] that these\r\nbranches, originally designated rhizophores by Nägeli and Leitgeb,\r\nas well as the dichotomously branched roots which they produce below\r\nthe level of the ground, possess a single vascular strand of monarch\r\ntype. It is interesting to find that in some species the aerial portion\r\nof the rhizophore has a xylem strand with a central protoxylem, an\r\ninstance of endarch structure like that in certain portions of the\r\nshoot-system of _S. spinosa_. The root-anatomy of _Selaginella_ and\r\nthe dichotomous habit of branching afford points of agreement with the\r\nsubterranean organs of _Lepidodendron_ and _Sigillaria_.\r\n\r\n_Leaves._ The leaves of _Selaginella_[124] usually consist of a\r\nreticulum of loosely arranged cells, but in some cases part of the\r\nmesophyll assumes the palisade form. The single vascular bundle\r\nconsists of a few small annular or spiral tracheae and at the apex of\r\nthe lamina the protoxylem elements are accompanied by several short\r\nreticulated pitted elements. Both foliage leaves and sporophylls are\r\ncharacterised by the possession of a ligule, a structure which may\r\npresent the appearance of a somewhat rectangular plate (fig. 130,\r\n4, _l_, and fig. 131, E–G, _l_) or assume a fan-shaped form with a\r\nlobed or papillate margin. The base, composed of large cells, is sunk\r\nin the tissue of the leaf close to its insertion on the stem (fig.\r\n131, E, _l_) and enclosed by a well-marked parenchymatous sheath. The\r\nsheath is separated from the vascular bundle of the leaf by one or\r\nmore layers of cells, and in some species these become transformed\r\ninto short tracheids. The ligule is regarded by Harvey-Gibson[125] as\r\na specialised ramentum which serves the temporary function of keeping\r\nmoist the growing-point and young leaves.\r\n\r\n_Cones._ The terminal portions of the branches of _Selaginella_ usually\r\nbear smaller leaves of uniform size which function as sporophylls, but\r\nin this genus the fertile shoots do not generally form such distinct\r\ncones as in many species of _Lycopodium_. In _S. grandis_ (figs. 130,\r\n3; 131, G) the long and narrow strobili consist of a slender axis\r\nbearing imbricate sporophylls in four rows: each sporophyll subtends\r\na sporangium situated between the ligule and the axis of the shoot.\r\nThe sporangium may be developed from the axis of the cone or, as in\r\n_Lycopodium_, from the cells of the sporophyll[126]. In some species\r\nthe lower sporophylls bear only megasporangia, each normally containing\r\nfour megaspores, the microsporangia being confined to the upper part of\r\nthe cone. This distribution of the two kinds of sporangia is, however,\r\nby no means constant[127]: in some cases, _e.g._ _S. rupestris_, cones\r\nmay bear megasporangia only, and in the cone of _S. grandis_, of which\r\na small piece is represented in fig. 131, G, all the sporangia were\r\nfound to contain microspores.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of two kinds of spores in _Selaginella_ constitutes\r\na feature of special importance from the point of view of the\r\nrelationship between the Phanerogams, in which heterospory is a\r\nconstant character, and the heterosporous Pteridophytes. One of the\r\nmost striking distinctions between the Phanerogams and the rest of the\r\nvegetable kingdom lies in the production of seeds. Recent work has,\r\nhowever, shown that seed-production can no longer be regarded as a\r\ndistinguishing feature of the Gymnosperms and Angiosperms. Palaeozoic\r\nplants which combined filicinean and cycadean features resembled the\r\nexisting Phanerogams in the possession of highly specialised seeds.\r\nThis discovery adds point to the comparison of the true seed with\r\nstructures concerned with reproduction in seedless plants, which in\r\nthe course of evolution gave rise to the more efficient arrangement\r\nfor the nursing, protection, and ultimate dispersal of the embryo. In\r\nthe megaspore of _Selaginella_ we have, as Hofmeister was the first\r\nto recognise in 1851, a structure homologous with the embryo-sac of\r\nthe Phanerogam. The embryo-sac consists of a large cell produced in a\r\nmass of parenchymatous tissue known as the nucellus which is almost\r\ncompletely enclosed by one or more integuments. Fertilisation of the\r\negg-cell within the embryo-sac takes place as a rule while the female\r\nreproductive organ is still attached to the parent-plant and separation\r\ndoes not occur until the ovule has become the seed.\r\n\r\nIn a few cases, notably in certain plants characteristic of Mangrove\r\nswamps, continuity between the seed and its parent is retained until\r\nafter germination. The megasporangium of _Selaginella_ dehisces[128]\r\nalong a line marked out by the occurrence of smaller cells over the\r\ncrest of the wall. It has been customary to describe the megaspores\r\nas being fertilised after ejection from the sporangia. This earlier\r\nseparation from the parent and the absence of any protective covering\r\nexternal to the spore-wall constitute two distinguishing features\r\nbetween seeds and megaspores. In _Selaginella apus_, a Californian\r\nspecies, Miss Lyon has shown that fertilisation of the egg-cell usually\r\ntakes place while the megaspore is still in the strobilus. On examining\r\nwithered decayed strobili of this species which had been partially\r\ncovered with the soil for some months after fertilisation of the\r\nmegaspores, several young plants were found with cotyledons and roots\r\nprojecting through the crevices of the megasporangia[129]. From this,\r\nadds Miss Lyon, “it seems safe to assume that an embryo may have two\r\nperiods of growth separated by one of quiescence quite comparable to\r\nthose of seed plants with marked xerophilous features.”\r\n\r\nIn another Western American species _S. rupestris_ described by the\r\nsame writer the cotyledons of young plants were found protruding\r\nfrom the imbricate sporophylls of a withered cone (fig. 131, D).\r\nThis species is interesting also from the occasional occurrence\r\nof one instead of four megasporangia in a sporangium; a condition\r\nwhich affords another connecting link between the heterosporous\r\nPteridophytes, on the one hand, and the seed-bearing Phanerogams in\r\nwhich the occurrence of a single embryo-sac (megaspore) in each ovule\r\nis the rule. The cones of _Selaginella rupestris_ retain connexion\r\nwith the plant through the winter and fertilisation occurs in the\r\nfollowing spring. After the embryo has been formed the megasporangium\r\n“becomes sunken in a shallow pit formed by the cushion-like outgrowth\r\nof the sporophyll around the pedicel.” It is suggested that this\r\noutgrowth may be comparable with the integument which grows up from\r\nthe sporophyll in the fossil genus _Lepidocarpon_[130] and almost\r\ncompletely encloses the sporangium. In the drawings given by Miss Lyon\r\nno features are recognisable which afford a parallel to the integument\r\nof _Lepidocarpon_. I have, however, endeavoured to show, by a brief\r\nreference to this author’s interesting account of the two Californian\r\nspecies, that the physiological and morphological resemblances between\r\nthe megasporangia of _Selaginella_ and the integumented ovules of the\r\nseed-bearing plants are sufficiently close to enable us to recognise\r\npossible lines of advance towards the development of the true seed.\r\n\r\nProfessor Campbell[131] records an additional example of a\r\n_Selaginella_—probably _S. Bigelovii_—from the dry region of Southern\r\nCalifornia in which the spores become completely dried up after the\r\nembryo has attained some size, remaining in that state until the more\r\nfavourable conditions succeeding the dry season induce renewed activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             =Isoetaceae.=\r\n\r\nThe genus _Isoetes_ is peculiar among Pteridophytes both in habit and\r\nin anatomical features. In its short and relatively thick tuberous\r\nstem, terminating in a crowded rosette of subulate leaves like those of\r\n_Juncus_ and bearing numerous adventitious roots, _Isoetes_ presents an\r\nappearance similar to that of many monocotyledonous plants. The habit\r\nof the genus is well represented by such species as _Isoetes lacustris_\r\nand _I. echinospora_[132] (fig. 132) both of which grow in freshwater\r\nlakes in Britain and in other north European countries. The latter\r\nspecies bears leaves reaching a length of 18 cm. The resemblance in\r\nhabit between this isolated member of the Pteridophytes and certain\r\nFlowering plants, although in itself of no morphological significance,\r\nis consistent with the view expressed by Campbell that _Isoetes_ may be\r\ndirectly related to the Monocotyledons[133].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 132. _Isoetes echinospora_ (After Motelay and\r\n  Vendryès).\r\n\r\n  A. Stem of _I. lacustris._\r\n  B. Base of sporophyll: _l_, ligule; _spg_, sporangium partially\r\n     covered by velum.]\r\n\r\nThere is as a rule little or no difference between the foliage leaves\r\nand sporophylls; in _I. lacustris_ the latter are rather larger and\r\nin the terrestrial species _I. hystrix_[134] the sterile leaves are\r\nrepresented by the expanded basal portions only, which persist like the\r\nleaf-bases of _Lepidodendron_ as dark brown scales to form a protective\r\ninvestment to the older part of the stem. The innermost leaves are\r\nusually sterile; next to these are sporophylls bearing megasporangia,\r\nand on the outside are the older sporophylls with microsporangia. The\r\nlong and slender portion of the leaf becomes suddenly expanded close\r\nto its attachment to the stem into a broad base of crescentic section\r\nwhich bears a fairly conspicuous ligule (figs. 132, B, _l_, 133, E,\r\n_l_) inserted by a foot or glossopodium in a pit near the upper part\r\nof the concave inner face. The ligule is usually larger than that\r\nof _Selaginella_, though of the same type. The free awl-like lamina\r\ncontains four large canals bridged across at intervals by transverse\r\ndiaphragms, and in the axial region a single vascular bundle of\r\ncollateral structure. Other vascular elements, in the form of numerous\r\nshort tracheids occur below the base of the transversely elongated\r\nligule.\r\n\r\nStomata are found on the leaves of _I. hystrix_, _I. Boryana_[135],\r\nand in other species which are not permanently submerged. Both\r\nmicrosporangia and megasporangia are characterised by their large\r\nsize and by the presence of trabeculae or strands of sterile tissue\r\n(fig. 133, E, H, _t_) completely bridging across the sporangial\r\ncavity or extending as irregular ingrowths among the spore-producing\r\ntissue. Similar sterile bands, though less abundant and smaller, are\r\noccasionally met with in the still larger sporangia of _Lepidostrobus_;\r\nthese may be regarded as a further development of the prominent pad\r\nof cells which projects into the sporangial cavity in recent species\r\nof _Lycopodium_ (fig. 126, D, _p_). The sporangia are attached by a\r\nvery short stalk to the base of a large depression in the leaf-base\r\nbelow the ligule, from the pit of which they are separated by a ridge\r\nof tissue known as the saddle, and from this ridge a veil of tissue\r\n(the velum) extends as a roof over the sporangial chamber (fig. 133,\r\nE, _v_). In most species there is a large gap between the lower edge\r\nof the velum and that of the sporangial pit, but in _I. hystrix_\r\nthis protective membrane is separated from the base of the leaf by a\r\nnarrow opening, the resemblance of which to the micropyle of an ovule\r\nsuggested to one of the older botanists the employment of the same\r\nterm[136]. Mr T. G. Hill[137] has called attention to the presence\r\nof mucilage canals in the base of the sporophylls of _I. hystrix_,\r\nwhich he compares with the strands of tissue known as the parichnos\r\naccompanying the leaf-traces of _Lepidodendron_ and _Sigillaria_ in\r\nthe outer cortex of the stem. The transverse section shown in fig.\r\n133, H and I, shows two of these mucilage canals in an early stage\r\nof development; a strand of parenchymatous elements distinguished\r\nby their partially disorganised condition and more deeply stained\r\nmembranes (fig. 133, I) runs through the spandrels of the sporophyll\r\ntissue close to the upper surface. There is a close resemblance\r\nbetween the structure of these partially formed mucilage-canals and\r\nthe tissue which has been called the secretory zone in Lepidodendron\r\nstems. Fig. 133, H, also shows a large microsporangium with prominent\r\ntrabeculae (_t_) lying below the velum. A longitudinal section (fig.\r\n133, E) through a sporophyll-base presents an appearance comparable\r\nwith that of an Araucarian cone-scale with its integumented ovule\r\nand micropyle. The megaspores are characterised by ridges, spines,\r\nand other surface-ornamentation[138]. Though usually unbranched, the\r\nperennial stem of _Isoetes_ (fig. 132) has in rare cases been found to\r\nexhibit dichotomous branching, a feature, as Solms-Laubach[139] points\r\nout, consistent with a Lycopodiaceous affinity. The apex is situated\r\nat the base of a funnel-shaped depression. The stem is always grooved;\r\nin some species two and in others three deep furrows extend from the\r\nbase up the sides of the short and thick axis towards the leaves: from\r\nthe sides of these furrows numerous slender roots are given off in\r\nacropetal succession. A stele of peculiar structure occupies the centre\r\nof the stem; cylindrical in the upper part (fig. 133, A), it assumes a\r\nnarrow elliptical or, in species in which there are three furrows, a\r\ntriangular form in the lower portion of the tuberous stem.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ISOETES]\r\n\r\nThe stem of _I. lacustris_ represented in fig. 132, A, from which the\r\nlaminae of the leaves have been removed from the summit affords an\r\nexample of a species with two furrows. The drawing shows the widely\r\ngaping sides of the broad furrow with circular root-scars and a few\r\nsimple and dichotomously branched roots. A short thick column of\r\nparenchymatous tissue projects from a slightly eccentric position on\r\nthe base of the stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 133. _Isoetes lacustris_.\r\n\r\n  A.

A group of secretory cells enlarged.]\r\n\r\nThe primary vascular cylinder[140] consists of numerous spiral,\r\nannular or reticulate tracheids (fig. 133, A, _x_) which are either\r\nisodiametric or longer in a horizontal than in a vertical direction,\r\nassociated with parenchyma. Lower in the stem crushed and disorganised\r\nxylem elements are scattered through a still living trabecular network\r\nof parenchymatous tissue. From the axial cylinder numerous leaf-traces\r\n(fig. 133, A, _lt_) radiate outwards, at first in a horizontal\r\ndirection and then gradually ascending towards the leaves. The vascular\r\ncylinder is of the type known as cauline; that is, some of the xylem is\r\ndistinct in origin from that which consists solely of the lower ends\r\nof leaf-traces. As in _Lycopodium_ the development of the metaxylem is\r\ncentripetal.\r\n\r\nVon Mohl[141], and a few years later Hofmeister[142], were the first\r\nbotanists to give a satisfactory account of the anatomy of _Isoetes_\r\nbut it is only recently[143] that fresh light has been thrown upon the\r\nstructural features of the genus the interest of which is enhanced\r\nby the many points of resemblance between the recent type and the\r\nPalaeozoic Lepidodendreae. A striking anatomical feature is the power\r\nof the stem to produce secondary vascular and non-vascular tissue;\r\nthe genus is also characterised by the early appearance of secondary\r\nmeristematic activity which renders it practically impossible to draw\r\nany distinct line between primary and secondary growth. A cylinder of\r\nthin-walled tissue (fig. 133, A, _a_) surrounds the primary central\r\ncylinder and in this a cambial zone, _c_, is recognised even close\r\nto the stem-apex; this zone of dividing cells is separated from the\r\nxylem by a few layers of rectangular cells to which the term prismatic\r\nzone has been applied. The early appearance of the cambial activity\r\non the edge of the vascular cylinder is shown in fig. 133, C, which\r\nrepresents part of a transverse section of a young stem. A leaf-trace,\r\n_lt_, is in connexion with the primary xylem, _x′_, which consists of\r\nshort tracheids, often represented only by their spiral or reticulately\r\nthickened bands of lignified wall, and scattered parenchyma. Some of\r\nthe radially elongated cells on the sides of the leaf-trace are seen\r\nto be in continuity on the outer edge of the stele, at _st_, with\r\nflattened elements, some of which are sieve-tubes. The position of a\r\nsecond leaf-trace is shown at _lt′_. External to the sieve-tubes the\r\ntissue consists of radially arranged series of rectangular cells, some\r\nof which have already assumed the function of a cambium (_c_). The\r\ntissue produced by the cambium on its inner edge consists of a varying\r\namount of secondary xylem composed of very short spiral tracheids; a\r\nfew of these may be lignified (fig. 133, A, _x²_) while others remain\r\nthin.\r\n\r\nPhloem elements, recognisable by the presence of a thickened reticulum\r\nenclosing small sieve-areas (fig 133, B, _s_) are fairly abundant,\r\nand for the rest this intracambial region is composed of thin-walled\r\nparenchyma. In longitudinal section these tissues present an appearance\r\nalmost identical with that observed in a transverse section. Fig.\r\n133, B represents a longitudinal section, through the intracambial\r\nzone and the edge of the stele, of a younger stem than that shown\r\nin fig. 133, A. Most of the radially disposed cells internal to\r\nthe meristematic region are parenchymatous without any distinctive\r\nfeatures; a few scattered sieve-tubes (_s_) are recognised by their\r\nelliptical sieve-areas and an occasional tracheid can be detected. The\r\ncambium cuts off externally a succession of segments which constitute\r\nadditional cortical tissue (fig. 133, A, _cr_) of homogeneous\r\nstructure, composed of parenchymatous cells containing starch and\r\nrich in intercellular spaces. As the stem grows in thickness the\r\nsecondary cortex reaches a considerable breadth and the superficial\r\nlayers are from time to time exfoliated as strips of dead and crushed\r\ntissue (fig. 133, A, _b_). The diagrammatic sketch reproduced in fig.\r\n133, A, serves to illustrate the arrangement and relative size of the\r\ntissue-regions in an _Isoetes_ stem. In the centre occur numerous\r\nspirally or reticulate tracheae scattered in parenchymatous tissue\r\nwhich has been considerably stretched and torn in the peripheral\r\nregion of the stele; the radiating lines mark the position of the\r\nleaf-traces (_lt_) in the more horizontal part of their course. The\r\nzone between the cambium (_c_) and the edge of the central cylinder\r\nconsists of radially disposed secondary tissue of short, and for the\r\nmost part unlignified, elements including sieve-tubes and parenchyma;\r\nthe secondary xylem elements consist largely of thin-walled rectangular\r\ncells with delicate spiral bands, but discontinuous rows of lignified\r\ntracheae (_x²_) occur in certain regions of the intracambial zone. The\r\nrest of the stem consists of secondary cortex (_cr_) with patches of\r\ndead tissue (_b_) still adhering to the irregularly furrowed surface.\r\nThe structure of the cambium and its products is shown in the detailed\r\ndrawing reproduced in fig. 133, D. Many of the elements cut off on the\r\ninner side of the cambium exhibit the characters of tracheids: most\r\nof these are unlignified, but others have thicker and lignified walls\r\n(_tr_).\r\n\r\n_I. hystrix_ appears to be exceptional in retaining its leaf-bases,\r\nwhich form a complete protective investment and prevent the exfoliation\r\nof dead cortex. Each leaf-trace consists of a few spiral tracheids\r\naccompanied by narrow phloem elements directly continuous with the\r\nsecondary phloem of the intracambial zone. Dr Scott and Mr Hill have\r\npointed out that a normal cambium is occasionally present in the stem\r\nof _I. hystrix_ during the early stages of growth; this gives rise\r\nto xylem internally. The few phloem elements observed external to\r\nthe cambium may be regarded as primary phloem, a tissue not usually\r\nrepresented in an Isoetes stem[144]. The occasional occurrence of this\r\nnormal cambium, may, as Scott and Hill suggest, be a survival from a\r\nformer condition in which the secondary thickening followed a less\r\npeculiar course. The lower leaf-traces become more or less obliterated\r\nas the result of the constant increase in thickness of the broad zone\r\nof secondary tissues through which they pass.\r\n\r\nThe adventitious roots are developed acropetally and arranged in\r\nparallel series on each side of the median line of the two or three\r\nfurrows. The three arms of the triangular stele of _I. hystrix_ and\r\nthe two narrow ends of the long axis of the stele of _I. lacustris_,\r\nwhich in transverse section has the form of a flattened ellipse, are\r\nbuilt up of successive root-bases. A root of _Isoetes_ (fig. 133, G)\r\npossesses one vascular bundle, _x_, with a single strand of protoxylem,\r\n_px_, thus agreeing in its monarch structure with the root-bundle in\r\n_Selaginella_ and many species of _Lycopodium_. The cortical region\r\nof the root consists of a few layers of outer cortex succeeded by\r\na large space, formed by the breaking down of the inner cortical\r\ntissue, into which the vascular bundle projects (fig. 133, F). The\r\npeculiarity of the roots in having a hollow cortex and an eccentric\r\nvascular bundle was noticed by Von Mohl[145]. In the monarch bundles,\r\nas in the fistular cortex and dichotomous branching, the roots of\r\n_Isoetes_ present a striking resemblance to the slender rootlets of the\r\nPalaeozoic _Stigmaria_ (see Page 246). The longitudinal section through\r\nthe base of a root of _Isoetes lacustris_ shown in fig. 133, F, affords\r\na further illustration of certain features common to the fossil and\r\nrecent types.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         FOSSIL LYCOPODIALES.\r\n\r\n                              Isoetaceae\r\n\r\nThe geological history of this division of the Pteridophyta is\r\nexceedingly meagre, a fact all the more regrettable as it is by no\r\nmeans improbable that in the surviving genus _Isoetes_ we have an\r\nisolated type possibly of considerable antiquity and closely akin to\r\nsuch extinct genera as _Pleuromeia_ and _Sigillaria_. If Saporta’s\r\nLower Cretaceous species _Isoetes Choffati[146]_, or more appropriately\r\n_Isoetites Choffati_, is correctly determined, it is the oldest fossil\r\nmember of the family and indeed the most satisfactory among the more\r\nthan doubtful species described as extinct forms of _Isoetes_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Isoetites.\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Isoetites_ was first used by Münster[147] in the\r\ndescription of a specimen, from the Jurassic lithographic slates of\r\nSolenhofen in Bavaria, which he named _Isoetites crociformis_. The\r\nspecific name was chosen to express a resemblance of the tuberous\r\nappearance of the lower part of the imperfectly preserved and\r\nindeterminable fossil to a Crocus corm.\r\n\r\nImpressions of Isoetes-like leaves from the Inferior Oolite of\r\nYorkshire figured by Phillips[148] and afterwards by Lindley[149] as\r\n_Solenites Murrayana_ were compared by the latter author with _Isoetes_\r\nand _Pilularia_, but these leaves are now generally assigned to Heer’s\r\ngymnospermous genus _Czekanowskia_. An examination of the structure of\r\nthe epidermal cells of these Jurassic impressions convinced me that\r\nthey resemble recent coniferous needles more closely than the leaves\r\nof any Pteridophyte. The genus _Czekanowskia[150]_ is recognised by\r\nseveral authors as a probable member of the Ginkgoales.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Isoetites Choffati._ Saporta.\r\n\r\nThe late Marquis of Saporta founded this species on two sets of\r\nimpressions from the Urgonian (Lower Cretaceous) of Portugal which,\r\nthough not found in actual organic connexion, may possibly be portions\r\nof the same plant. Small relatively broad tuberous bodies reaching\r\na breadth of 1 cm. are compared with the short and broad stem of\r\n_Isoetes_, which they resemble in bearing numerous appendages radiating\r\nfrom the surface like the roots of the recent species; on the exposed\r\nface of the stem occur scattered circular scars representing the\r\nposition of roots which were detached before fossilisation. Other\r\nimpressions are identified as the basal portions of sporophylls bearing\r\nsporangia: these suggest the expanded base of the fertile leaves of\r\n_Isoetes_ with vertically elongated sporangia, some of which have\r\na smooth surface while in others traces of internal structure are\r\nexposed; the interior consists of an irregular network with depressions\r\ncontaining carbonised remains of spores.\r\n\r\nWhile recognising a general resemblance to the sporophylls of\r\n_Isoetes_, certain differences are obvious: there is no ligule in\r\nthe fossil leaves nor are there any distinct traces of vascular\r\nstrands such as occur in the leaves of recent species. The form of\r\nthe sporangium, more elongated than in the majority of recent forms,\r\nis compared by Saporta with that in a south European species _Isoetes\r\nsetacea_ Spr.\r\n\r\nSuch evidence as we have lends support to the inclusion of these\r\nPortuguese fossils in the genus _Isoetites_, but apart from the fact\r\nthat we have no proof of any connexion between the stems and supposed\r\nsporophylls, the resemblance of the latter to those of _Isoetes_ is,\r\nperhaps, hardly sufficient to satisfy all reasonable scepticism.\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Isoetopsis_ was used by Saporta as more appropriate\r\nthan _Isoetes_ for some Eocene fossils from Aix-en-Provence which are\r\ntoo doubtful to rank as trustworthy evidence of the existence of the\r\nrecent genus. The species, _Isoetopsis subaphylla_[151] is founded on\r\nimpressions of small scales, 4 mm. long, bearing circular bodies which\r\nare compared with sporangia or spores.\r\n\r\nOther records of fossils referred to _Isoetes_ need not be described\r\nas they have no claim to be regarded as contributions towards the past\r\nhistory of the genus. Heer’s Miocene species _Isoetites Scheuzeri_ and\r\n_I. Braunii_ Unger[152] from Switzerland are based on unsatisfactory\r\nmaterial and are of no importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Pleuromeia.\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Pleuromeia_, was suggested by Corda[153] for a fossil\r\nfrom the Bunter Sandstone, the original description of which was based\r\nby Münster[154] on a specimen discovered in a split stone from the\r\ntower of Magdeburg Cathedral.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the specimens have been obtained from the neighbourhood\r\nof Bernburg, but a few examples are recorded from Commern and other\r\nGerman localities: all are now included under the name _Pleuromeia\r\nSternbergi_. Germar, who published one of the earlier accounts of the\r\nspecies, states that Corda dissented from Münster’s choice of the name\r\n_Sigillaria_ and proposed the new generic title _Pleuromeia_. One of\r\nthe best descriptions of the genus we owe to Solms-Laubach[155] whose\r\npaper contains references to earlier writers. Illustrations have been\r\npublished by Münster, Germar[156], Bischof[157], Solms-Laubach and\r\nPotonié[158].\r\n\r\n  _Pleuromeia Sternbergi._ (Münster.)\r\n              Fig. 134.\r\n\r\n  1842. _Sigillaria Sternbergii_, Münster.\r\n  1854. _Sagenaria Bischofii_, Goeppert[159].\r\n  1885. _Sigillaria oculina_, Blanckenhorn.\r\n  1904. _Pleuromeia oculina_, Potonié.\r\n\r\n_Pleuromeia Sternbergi_ is represented by casts of vegetative and\r\nfertile axes, but the preservation of the latter is not sufficiently\r\ngood to enable us to draw any very definite conclusions as to the\r\nnature of the reproductive organs. Casts of the stems reach a length\r\nof about 1 metre and a diameter of 5–6 cm., or in some cases 10 cm.;\r\nall of them are in a more or less decorticated state, the degree\r\nof decortication being responsible for differences in the external\r\nfeatures which led Spieker[160] to adopt more than one specific name.\r\n\r\nFig. 134, A, represents a sketch, made some years ago, of a specimen\r\nin the Breslau Museum which contains several examples of this species,\r\namong others those described by Germar in 1852. The cylindrical cast\r\n(38 cm. long by 12 cm. in circumference), which has been slightly\r\nsqueezed towards the upper end, bears spirally arranged imperfectly\r\npreserved leaf-scars and the lower end shows the truncated base of one\r\nof the short Stigmaria-like arms characteristic of the plant. As shown\r\nclearly in a specimen originally figured by Bischof and more recently\r\nby Potonié[161], the stem-base is divided by a double dichotomy into\r\nfour short and broad lobes with blunt apices and bent upwards like\r\nthe arms of a grappling iron (fig. 134, D). The surface of this\r\nbasal region is characterised by numerous circular scars (fig. 134,\r\nD; 4 scars enlarged) in the form of slightly projecting areas with a\r\ndepression in the centre of each. These are undoubtedly the scars of\r\nrootlets, remains of which are occasionally seen radiating through the\r\nsurrounding rock. As seen in fig. 134, D, _a_, the fractured surface\r\nof a basal area may reveal the existence of an axial vascular cylinder\r\ngiving off slender branches to the rootlets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 134. _Pleuromeia Sternbergi._\r\n\r\n  A.

(After\r\n     Solms-Laubach.)]\r\n\r\nThe bulbous enlargement at the base of the Brown seaweed _Laminaria\r\nbulbosa_ Lam.[162] simulates the swollen base of _Pleuromeia_; but a\r\nconfusion between these two plants is hardly likely to occur. Above\r\nthe Stigmaria-like base the gradually tapered axis, in the less\r\ndecorticated specimens, bears spirally disposed transversely elongated\r\nareas consisting of two triangular scars between which is the point\r\nof exit of a leaf-trace. The form of the leaf-scars is best seen on\r\nthe face of a mould figured by Solms-Laubach (fig. 134, C): in this\r\ncase the two triangular areas appear as slight projections separated\r\nby a narrow groove marking the position of the vascular bundle of the\r\nleaf. The curved lines above and below the leaf-scar probably mark the\r\nboundary of the leaf-base. The two triangular scars are compared by\r\nSolms-Laubach and by Potonié with the parichnos-scars of _Sigillaria_\r\nand _Lepidodendron_ (cf. fig. 146, C), but the large size of the\r\nPleuromeia scars constitutes an obvious difference though possibly not\r\na distinction of importance.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of a vertical canal filled with carbonaceous material\r\nin some of the stems throws light on the internal structure: the\r\ncanal, which is described by Solms-Laubach as having a stellate\r\noutline in transverse section recalls the narrow central cylinder\r\nof a Lepidodendron stem, and this comparison is strengthened by the\r\npresence of obliquely ascending grooves which represent leaf-traces\r\npassing through the cortex. In specimens which have lost more of the\r\ncortical tissues the surface is characterised by spirally disposed,\r\ndiscontinuous vertical grooves representing portions of leaf-traces\r\nprecisely as they appear in similar casts of _Lepidodendron_. There\r\nis no direct evidence of the existence of secondary wood in the stem,\r\nbut, as Potonié has pointed out, the greater transverse elongation of\r\nthe leaf-scars in the lower part of a cast (fig. 134, A) points to the\r\nproduction of some secondary tissue either in the vascular cylinder or\r\ncortex, or possibly in both regions.\r\n\r\nIn some specimens of _Pleuromeia_ the upper portion is clothed with\r\ncrowded and imbricate sporophylls which reach a length of 2·5 cm., a\r\nmaximum breadth of 2·7 cm., and a thickness of 1 mm. Each sporophyll\r\nhas a thin wing-like border, and on the lower face are several parallel\r\nlines. Solms-Laubach describes the sporangium or ovule as attached to\r\nthe lower surface of the sporophyll and this opinion has been confirmed\r\nby Fitting[163] who has also brought forward satisfactory evidence in\r\nfavour of the sporangial nature of the reproductive organs. Fitting\r\nfound numerous spores in the Bunter Sandstone near Halle; these are\r\nflattened circular bodies 0·5–0·7 mm. in diameter with a granulated\r\nsurface and the three converging lines characteristic of spores\r\nproduced in tetrads. The comparison made by this author between the\r\nsporophylls of _Pleuromeia_, which bore the sporangia on the lower\r\nsurface instead of on the upper as in other lycopodiaceous plants, and\r\nthe pollen-sacs of Conifers, is worthy of note in reference to the\r\npossible relationship between Conifers and Lycopods.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the _Isoetes_ stem represented in fig. 132, A, with the\r\nbase of a _Pleuromeia_ shows a striking similarity, but, as Fitting\r\npoints out, the Stigmaria-like arms of the fossil contained a vascular\r\ncylinder whereas the blunt lobes of _Isoetes_ consist exclusively of\r\ncortical tissue, the roots being given off from the grooves between the\r\nlobes of the tuberous stem.\r\n\r\nThe position of _Pleuromeia_ must for the present be left an open\r\nquestion; it is, however, clear that the plant bears a close\r\nresemblance in the form of its base to the Stigmarian branches of\r\n_Lepidodendron_ and _Sigillaria_. The vegetative shoot appears to be\r\nconstructed on a plan similar to that of these two Palaeozoic genera,\r\nbut the strobilus is of a different type. It would seem probable that\r\n_Pleuromeia_ may be closely allied to _Isoetes_ and to the arborescent\r\nLycopods of Palaeozoic floras. It is not improbably a link in a chain\r\nof types which includes _Sigillaria_ on the one hand and _Isoetes_ on\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that a specimen from the Lower Bunter of Commern\r\nwhich Blanckenhorn made the type of a new species, _Sigillaria\r\noculina_ (fig. 134, B) is specifically identical with _Pleuromeia\r\nSternbergi_. An examination of a cast of the type-specimen in the\r\nBerlin Bergakademie led me to regard the fossil with some hesitation\r\nas a true _Sigillaria_, but a more extended knowledge of _Pleuromeia_\r\nlends support to the view adopted by Potonié[164] that Blanckenhorn’s\r\nplant is not genetically distinct from _Pleuromeia Sternbergi_. The\r\nresemblance between _Sigillaria oculina_ and some of the Palaeozoic\r\nspecies of _Sigillaria_ emphasised by Weiss[165] has given rise to the\r\nbelief that the genus _Sigillaria_ persisted into the Triassic era; it\r\nis, however, highly probable that the Bunter specimen has no claim to\r\nthe generic name under which it has hither to been known.\r\n\r\nThe Bunter Sandstone in which _Pleuromeia_ is the sole representative\r\nof plant-life, at least in certain localities, is usually considered to\r\nbe a desert formation. We may not be far wrong in accepting Fitting’s\r\nsuggestion that in this isolated species we have a relic of the sparse\r\nvegetation which was able to exist where the presence of lakes added a\r\ntouch of life to the deadness of the Triassic desert.\r\n\r\n_Pleuromeia_ is recorded by Fliche as a rare fossil in the Middle Trias\r\nof France in the neighbourhood of Lunéville[166].\r\n\r\n\r\n              Herbaceous fossil species of Lycopodiales.\r\n\r\nThe history of our knowledge of fossil representatives of the\r\nLycopodiales, as also of the Equisetales, affords a striking\r\nillustration of the danger of attempting to found a classification\r\non such differences as are expressed by the terms herbaceous and\r\narborescent in the sense in which they are usually employed. As we have\r\nseen[167], the presence of secondary wood in stems of the Palaeozoic\r\nplant now known as _Calamites_ led so competent a botanist as Adolphe\r\nBrongniart to recognise a distinct generic type _Calamodendron_, which\r\nhe placed in the Gymnosperms, reserving the designation _Calamities_\r\nfor species in which no indication of secondary thickening had been\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the genus _Sigillaria_ was regarded as a Gymnosperm because\r\nit was believed to be distinguished from _Lepidodendron_ by the power\r\nof forming secondary vascular tissues; the latter genus, originally\r\nthought to be always herbaceous, was classed with the Pteridophytes.\r\nAt the time when this unnatural separation was made between stems with\r\nsecondary wood and those in which no secondary wood was known to exist,\r\nbotanists were not aware of the occurrence of any recent Pteridophyte\r\nwhich shared with the higher plants the power of secondary growth in\r\nthickness provided by means of a meristematic zone. It is true that the\r\npresence or absence of a cambium does not in practice always coincide\r\nwith the division into herbaceous and arborescent plants: no one would\r\nspeak of a Date-Palm as a herbaceous plant despite the absence of\r\nsecondary wood.\r\n\r\nThe danger which should be borne in mind, in adopting as a matter of\r\nconvenience the term herbaceous as a sectional heading, is that it\r\nshould not be taken to imply a complete inability of the so-called\r\nherbaceous types to make secondary additions to their conducting\r\ntissues. The specimens on which the species of _Lycopodites_ and\r\n_Selaginellites_, (genera which may be designated herbaceous,) are\r\nfounded are preserved as impressions and not as petrifications; we\r\ncan, therefore, base definitions only on habit and on such features\r\nas are shown by fertile leaves and sporangia. We are fully justified\r\nin concluding from evidence adduced by Goldenberg more than fifty\r\nyears ago and from similar evidence brought to light by more recent\r\nresearches, that there existed in the Palaeozoic era lycopodiaceous\r\nspecies in close agreement in their herbaceous habit with the lycopods\r\nof present-day floras. It has been suggested[168] that the direct\r\nancestors of the genera _Lycopodium_ and _Selaginella_ are represented\r\nby the species of _Lycopodites_ and _Selaginellites_ rather than by\r\n_Lepidodendron_ and _Sigillaria_, the arborescent habit of which has\r\nbeen rendered familiar by the numerous attempts to furnish pictorial\r\nreproductions of a Palaeozoic forest. Until we are able to subject the\r\nspecies classed as herbaceous to microscopical examination we cannot\r\nmake any positive statement as to the correctness of this view, but\r\nsuch facts as we possess lead us to regard the suggestion as resting on\r\na sound basis.\r\n\r\nPalaeobotanical literature abounds in records of species of\r\n_Lycopodites_, _Lycopodium_, _Selaginella_ and _Selaginites_, which\r\nhave been so named in the belief that their vegetative shoots bear\r\na greater resemblance to those of recent lycopodiaceous plants than\r\nto the foliage shoots of _Lepidodendron_. Many of these records are\r\nvalueless: _Lepidodendra_, twigs of _Bothrodendron_[169] species\r\nof conifers, fern rhizomes, and _Aphlebiae_[170] have masqueraded\r\nas herbaceous lycopods. It is obvious that an attempt to identify\r\nfossils presenting a general agreement in habit and leaf-form with\r\nrecent species of lycopods must be attended with considerable risk of\r\nerror. Recent Conifers include several species the smaller branches\r\nof which simulate the leafy shoots of certain species of _Lycopodium_\r\nand _Selaginella_, and it is not surprising to find that this\r\nsimilarity has been responsible for many false determinations. Among\r\nMosses and the larger foliose Liverworts there are species which in\r\nthe condition of imperfectly preserved impressions, might easily be\r\nmistaken for lycopodiaceous shoots: an equally close resemblance is\r\napparent in the case of some flowering plants, such as New Zealand\r\nspecies of _Veronica_, _Tafalla graveolens_ (a Composite), _Lavoisiera\r\nlycopodiodes_ Gard.[171] (a species of Melastomaceae), all of which\r\nhave the habit of Cupressineae among the conifers as well as of certain\r\nlycopodiaceous plants. It may be impossible to decide whether fossil\r\nimpressions of branches, which are presumably lycopodiaceous, bear\r\ntwo kinds of leaves[172] like the great majority of recent species of\r\n_Selaginella_. _Selaginella grandis_, if seen from the under surface,\r\nwould appear to have two rows of leaves only and might be confused with\r\na small twig of such a conifer as _Dacrydium Kirkii_, a New Zealand\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe New Zealand conifers _Dacrydium cupressinum_ Soland. and\r\n_Podocarpus dacrydioides_ Rich. closely simulate species of\r\n_Selaginellites_ and _Lycopodites_: in the British Museum a specimen\r\nof the latter species bears a label describing it as _Lycopodium\r\narboreum_ (Sir Joseph Hooker and Dr Solander; 1769). The twigs of the\r\nTasmanian conifer _Microcachyrs_ _tetragona_ Hook. f. are very similar\r\nin habit to shoots of the recent _Lycopodium tetragonum_ (fig. 121, C).\r\n\r\nIn the description of examples of _Lycopodites_ and _Selaginellites_\r\nI have confined myself to such as appear to be above suspicion either\r\nbecause of the presence of spore-bearing organs or, in a few cases,\r\nbecause the specimens of sterile shoots are sufficiently large to show\r\nthe form of branching in addition to the texture of the leaves. The\r\ntwo generic names _Lycopodites_ and _Selaginellites_ are employed for\r\nfossil species which there are substantial grounds for regarding as\r\nrepresentatives of _Lycopodium_ and _Selaginella_. The designation\r\n_Selaginellites_ is adopted only for species which afford evidence of\r\nheterospory; the name _Lycopodites_, on the other hand, is used in\r\na comprehensive sense to include all forms—whether homophyllous or\r\nheterophyllous—which are not known to be heterosporous. This restricted\r\nuse of the generic name _Selaginellites_ is advocated by Zeiller[173],\r\nwho instituted the genus, and by Halle[174] in his recent paper on\r\nherbaceous lycopods.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Lycopodites.\r\n\r\nThe generic term _Lycopodites_ was used by Brongniart in 1822[175]\r\nin describing some Tertiary examples of slender axes clothed with\r\nsmall scale-like leaves which he named _Lycopodites squamatus_. These\r\nare fragments of coniferous shoots. In the _Prodrome d’une histoire\r\ndes végétaux fossiles_[176] Brongniart included several Palaeozoic\r\nand Jurassic species in _Lycopodites_ and instituted a new genus\r\n_Selaginites_, expressing a doubt as to the wisdom of attempting to\r\ndraw a generic distinction between the two sets of species. In a later\r\nwork[177] he recognised only one undoubted species, _Lycopodites\r\nfalcatus_. The first satisfactory account of fossils referred to\r\n_Lycopodites_ is by Goldenberg[178] who gave the following definition\r\nof the genus:—“Branches with leaves spirally disposed or in whorls.\r\nSporangia in the axil of foliage leaves or borne in terminal strobili.”\r\n\r\nIt was suggested by Lesquereux[179] that Goldenberg’s definition,\r\nwhich was intended to apply to herbaceous species, should be extended\r\nso as to include forms with woody stems but which do not in all\r\nrespects agree with _Lepidodendron_. Kidston[180] subsequently adopted\r\nLesquereux’s modification of Goldenberg’s definition. We cannot draw\r\nany well-defined line between impressions of herbaceous forms and those\r\nof small arborescent species. We use the name _Lycopodites_ for such\r\nplants as appear to agree in habit with recent species of _Lycopodium_\r\nand _Selaginella_ and which, so far as we know, were not heterosporous:\r\nit is highly probable that some of the species so named had the\r\npower of producing secondary wood, a power possessed by some recent\r\nPteridophytes which never attain the dimensions of arborescent plants.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown by Halle[181], who has re-examined several of\r\nGoldenberg’s specimens which have been acquired by the Stockholm\r\nPalaeobotanical Museum, that some of his species of _Lycopodites_\r\nare heterosporous and therefore referable to Zeiller’s genus\r\n_Selaginellites_.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 Renault described two species of supposed Palaeozoic Lycopods\r\nas _Lycopodium punctatum_ and _L. Renaultii_[182], the latter name\r\nhaving been suggested by Brongniart to whom specimens were submitted.\r\nThese species were afterwards recognised by their author as wrongly\r\nnamed and were transferred to the genus _Heterangium_[183], a\r\ndetermination which is probably correct; it is at least certain that\r\nthe use of the name _Lycopodium_ cannot be upheld.\r\n\r\nWe have unfortunately to rely on specimens without petrified tissues\r\nfor our information in regard to the history of _Lycopodites_ and\r\n_Selaginellites_. Among the older fossils referred to _Lycopodites_\r\nare specimens from Lower Carboniferous rocks at Shap in Westmoreland\r\nwhich Kidston originally described as _Lycopodites Vanuxemi_[184],\r\nidentifying them with Goeppert’s _Sigillaria Vanuxemi_[185] founded\r\non German material. In a later paper Kidston transferred the British\r\nspecimens of vegetative shoots to a new genus _Archaeosigillaria_[186].\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _Lycopodites Stockii_ Kidston[187].\r\n\r\nThe plant so named was discovered in Lower Carboniferous strata of\r\nEskdale, Dumfries, Scotland; it is represented by imperfectly preserved\r\nshoots bearing a terminal strobilus and was originally described by\r\nKidston as apparently possessing two kinds of foliage leaves borne\r\nin whorls. The larger leaves have an ovate cordate lamina with an\r\nacuminate apex, while the smaller leaves, which are less distinct,\r\nare transversely elongated, and simulate sporangia in appearance.\r\nDr Kidston’s figure of this species has recently been reproduced by\r\nProfessor Bower[188] who speaks of the supposed smaller leaves as\r\nsporangia, a view with which the author of the species agrees. It would\r\nappear that this identification is, however, based solely on external\r\nresemblance and has not been confirmed by the discovery of any spores.\r\nAssuming the sporangial nature of these structures, this Palaeozoic\r\ntype represents, as Bower points out, a condition similar to that in\r\nsome recent species of _Lycopodium_ in which sporangia are not confined\r\nto a terminal strobilus but occur also in association with ordinary\r\nfoliage leaves. The strobilus consists of crowded sporophylls which are\r\ntoo imperfect to afford any definite evidence as to their homosporous\r\nor heterosporous nature. As Solms-Laubach[189] points out, this type\r\nrecalls _Lycopodium Phlegmaria_ among recent species.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Lycopodites Reidii_ Penhallow.\r\n\r\nProfessor Penhallow[190] instituted this name for a specimen measuring\r\n8 cm. long by 6 mm. in breadth, collected by Mr Reid from the Old Red\r\nSandstone of Caithness, consisting of an axis bearing narrow lanceolate\r\nleaves some of which bear sporangia at the base.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Lycopodites Gutbieri_ Goeppert[191].\r\n\r\n1894, _Lycopodites elongatus_ Kidston[192] (not Goldenberg).\r\n\r\nThe species, figured by Geinitz as _Lycopodites Gutbieri_[193], from\r\nthe Coal-Measures of Saxony is probably a true representative of the\r\ngenus. The Saxon specimens are heterophyllous; the larger lanceolate\r\nand slightly falcate leaves arranged in two rows, are 4–5 mm. long\r\nwhile the smaller leaves are one half or one third this size; some of\r\nthe dichotomously branched shoots terminate in long and narrow strobili\r\nnot unlike those of Zeiller’s species _Selaginellites Suissei_[194].\r\nKidston[195] has included under this specific name some fragments\r\ncollected by Hemingway from the Upper Coal-Measures of Radstock,\r\nSomersetshire, but as only one form of leaf is seen the reasons for\r\nadopting Goeppert’s designation are perhaps hardly adequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Lycopodites ciliatus_ Kidston[196].\r\n\r\nUnder this name Kidston describes a small specimen, obtained by\r\nHemingway from the Middle Coal-Measures of Barnsley in Yorkshire,\r\nconsisting of a slender forked axis bearing oval-acuminate leaves\r\napproximately 5 mm. long with a finely ciliate margin. Associated with\r\nthe leaves were found spores which Kidston regards as megaspores.\r\n\r\n\r\n              _Lycopodites macrophyllus_ Goldenberg[197].\r\n\r\nThis species, originally described by Goldenberg from the Coal-Measures\r\nof Saarbrücken has been re-examined by Halle[198] who is unable to\r\nconfirm Goldenberg’s statement as to heterophylly. The shoots closely\r\nresemble _Selaginellites primaevus_[199] (Gold).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 135. _Selaginellites and Lycopodites._ (After\r\n  Halle.)\r\n\r\n  A. _Selaginellites primaevus_ (Gold.). × 10.\r\n  B.

Fig. 135, C.\r\n\r\nHalle has founded this species on specimens, from the Coal-Measures\r\nof Zwickau in Saxony, characterised by dimorphic lanceolate leaves in\r\nfour rows, the larger being 4–6 mm. long: the smaller leaves have a\r\nciliate edge. A comparison is made with the recent species _Selaginella\r\narabica_ Baker, _S. revoluta_ Bak., and _S. armata_ Bak. in which the\r\nleaves are described as ciliate. In the absence of sporangia and spores\r\nthe species is placed in the genus _Lycopodites_.\r\n\r\n  _Lycopodites lanceolatus_ (Brodie).

(After\r\n  Miss Sollas. × 40.)\r\n\r\n  _a_, Sporangium wall; _b_, leaf.\r\n  _c_, remains of tubular elements in stem.]\r\n\r\nSpecimens referred to this species were originally recorded by Brodie\r\nfrom Rhaetic rocks in the Severn valley, the name _Naiadita_ being\r\nchosen as the result of Lindley’s comparison of the small and delicate\r\nleaves with those of recent species of the Monocotyledonous family\r\nNaiadaceae. The species may be described as follows:\r\n\r\nPlant slender and moss-like in habit. The axis, which is delicate and\r\nthread-like, bears numerous linear acuminate or narrow ovate leaves\r\nreaching a length of approximately 5 mm. Under a low magnifying power\r\nthe thin lamina of the leaves is seen to have a superficial layer of\r\npolygonal or rectangular cells arranged in parallel series (fig. 136\r\n_b_). There is no trace of midrib or stomata. The sporangia are more or\r\nless spherical and short-stalked, situated at the base of the foliage\r\nleaves and containing numerous tetrads of spores. The spores have a\r\ndiameter of 0·08 mm.\r\n\r\nBuckman founded additional species on differences in the shape of the\r\nleaves but, as Miss Sollas has pointed out, such differences as he\r\nnoticed may be detected on the same axis. It was stated in an earlier\r\nchapter[208] that Starkie Gardner, on insufficient evidence, proposed\r\nto place Brodie’s plant among the Mosses. The discovery by Mr Wickes\r\nof new material at Pylle hill near Bristol afforded an opportunity\r\nfor a re-examination of the species: this was successfully undertaken\r\nby Miss Sollas who was able to dissolve out spores from the matrix by\r\ndilute hydrochloric acid, and to recognise the remains of internal\r\nstructure in the slender axes by exposing successive surfaces with\r\nthe aid of a hone. It was found that sporangia occurred at the base\r\nof some of the leaves containing numerous tetrads of spores, the\r\nindividual spores having a diameter of 0·08 mm., apparently twice\r\nas large as those of any recent species of _Lycopodium_. Fig. 136\r\nshows a sporangium, _a_, at the base of a leaf, _b_. Indications of\r\ntubular elements were recognised in the stem and it is noteworthy\r\nthat although the outlines of epidermal cells on the leaves are well\r\npreserved no stomata were found. The leaves of the recent American\r\nspecies _Lycopodium alopecuroides_ Linn. var. _aquaticum_ Spring[209],\r\nwhich lives under water, possess stomata. It is probable that in\r\n_Lycopodites lanceolatus_ the leaves had a very thin lamina and\r\nmay have been similar in structure to those of recent Mosses; the\r\nplant possibly lived in very humid situations or grew submerged.\r\nMiss Sollas’s investigations afford a satisfactory demonstration of\r\nthe lycopodiaceous nature of this small Rhaetic species: as I have\r\nelsewhere suggested[210], the generic name _Lycopodites_ should be\r\nsubstituted for that of _Naiadita_. Examples of this species may be\r\nseen in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nThe Rhaetic species from Scania, _Lycopodites scanicus_ Nath.[211] (_in\r\nlitt._), recently re-described by Halle and originally referred by\r\nNathorst to _Gleichenia_ affords another example of the occurrence of a\r\nsmall herbaceous lycopod of Rhaetic age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 137. _Lycopodites falcatus_ L. and H. From the\r\n  Inferior Oolite of Yorkshire. (Nat. size. M.S.)]\r\n\r\n  _Lycopodites falcatus_ Lind. and Hutt.

The example represented in fig. 137 shows the dichotomously\r\nbranched shoots bearing two rows of broadly falcate leaves. A careful\r\nexamination of the type-specimen[216] revealed traces of what\r\nappeared to be smaller leaves, but there is no satisfactory proof of\r\nheterophylly. No sporangia or spores have been found. This British\r\nspecies has been recorded from Lower Jurassic or Rhaetic rocks of\r\nBornholm[217] and a similar though probably not identical type,\r\n_Lycopodites Victoriae_[218], has been recognised in Jurassic strata\r\nof Australia (South Gippsland, Victoria). An Indian plant described\r\nby Oldham and Morris[219] from the Jurassic flora of the Rajmahal\r\nhills as _Araucarites_ (?) _gracilis_ and subsequently transferred by\r\nFeistmantel to Schimper’s genus _Cheirolepis_[220] may be identical\r\nwith the Yorkshire species. The Jurassic fragments described by Heer\r\nfrom Siberia as _Lycopodites tenerrimus_[221] may be lycopodiaceous,\r\nbut they are of no botanical interest.\r\n\r\nOther examples of Mesozoic Lycopods have been recorded, but in the\r\nabsence of well-preserved shoots and sporangia they are noteworthy only\r\nas pointing to a wide distribution of _Lycopodites_ in Jurassic and\r\nCretaceous floras[222].\r\n\r\nFrom Tertiary strata species of supposed herbaceous lycopods have been\r\nfigured by several authors, one of the best of which is _Selaginella\r\nBerthoudi_ Lesq.[223] from Tertiary beds in Colorado. This species\r\nagrees very closely in the two forms of leaf with _Selaginella\r\ngrandis_, but as the specimens are sterile we have not sufficient\r\njustification for the employment of the generic name _Selaginellites_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Selaginellites.\r\n\r\nThis generic name has been instituted by Zeiller[224] for specimens\r\nfrom the coal basis of Blanzy (France). It is applied to heterosporous\r\nspecies with the habit of _Selaginella_: Zeiller preferred the\r\ndesignation _Selaginellites_ to _Selaginella_ on the ground that\r\nthe type species differs from recent forms in having more than four\r\nmegaspores in each megasporangium. It is, however, convenient to extend\r\nthe term to all heterosporous fossil species irrespective of the\r\nspore-output.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Selaginellites Suissei_ Zeiller.\r\n\r\nThis species was described in Zeiller’s preliminary note[225] as\r\n_Lycopodites Suissei_, but he afterwards transferred it to the genus\r\n_Selaginellites_. In habit the plant bears a close resemblance\r\nto _Lycopodites macrophyllus_ of Goldenberg; the shoots, 1–3 mm.\r\nthick, are branched in a more or less dichotomous fashion and bear\r\ntetrastichous leaves. The larger leaves reach a length of 4–6 mm.\r\nand a breadth of 2–3 mm.; the smaller leaves are described as almost\r\ninvisible, closely applied to the axis, oval-lanceolate and 1–2 mm.\r\nlong with a breadth of 0·5–0·75 mm. Long and narrow strobili (15\r\ncm. by 8–10 mm.) terminate the fertile branches; these bear crowded\r\nsporophylls with a triangular lamina and finely denticulate margin.\r\nOval sporangia were found on the lower sporophylls containing 16–24\r\nspherical megaspores 0·6–0·65 mm. in diameter. The outer membrane\r\nof the spore is characterised by fine anastomosing ridges and thin\r\nplates radiating from the apex and forming an equatorial collarette.\r\nThe microspores have a diameter of 40–60μ and the same type of outer\r\nmembrane as in the megaspores. The megaspores of the recent species\r\n_Selaginella caulescens_, as figured by Bennie and Kidston[226],\r\nresemble those of the Palaeozoic type in the presence of an equatorial\r\nflange. It is interesting to find that, in spite of the occurrence of\r\n16–24 megaspores in a single sporangium the size of the fossil spores\r\nexceeds that of the recent species.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Selaginellites primaevus_ (Gold.).

(After\r\n  Goldenberg.)]\r\n\r\nIn habit this species, first recorded by Goldenberg from the\r\nCoal-Measures of Saarbrücken, is similar to _S. Suissei_ Zeill.\r\n\r\nThe drawing reproduced in fig. 138 is a copy of that of the\r\ntype-specimen: another specimen, named by Goldenberg, is figured\r\nby Halle in his recently published paper. The leaves appear to be\r\ndistichous: no smaller leaves have been detected, though Halle is\r\ninclined to regard the plant as heterophyllous. The sporophylls, borne\r\nin slender terminal strobili, are smaller than the foliage leaves and\r\nspirally disposed (fig. 138; smaller specimen). Halle succeeded in\r\ndemonstrating that some of the sporangia contained a single tetrad of\r\nspores, each spore having a diameter of 0·4–0·5 mm. No microspores\r\nwere found, but it is clear that the species was heterosporous and\r\nthat it agrees with recent species in having only four spores in the\r\nmegasporangium.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Selaginellites elongatus_ (Gold.). Fig. 135, B, D.\r\n\r\n  1855 _Lycopodites elongatus_, Goldenberg[230].\r\n  1870 _Lycopodium elongatum_, Schimper[231].\r\n\r\nThe shoots of this species resemble the recent _Lycopodium\r\ncomplanatum_; they differ from those of _Selaginellites primaevus_ in\r\ntheir long and narrow branches which bear two forms of leaf. The longer\r\nleaves, arranged in opposite pairs, are slightly falcate; the smaller\r\nleaves are appressed to the axis and have a triangular cordate lamina.\r\nAnother peculiarity of this species is the occurrence of sporangia in\r\nthe axil of the foliage leaves, a feature characteristic of the recent\r\n_Lycopodium Selago_. In recent species of _Selaginella_ the sporophylls\r\nare always in strobili. No microspores have been found nor the walls\r\nof megasporangia, but tetrads of megaspores were isolated by Halle:\r\nthe spores have three radiating ridges (fig. 135, B) connected by\r\nan equatorial ridge. Halle estimates the number of spores (0·45 mm.\r\nin diameter) in a sporangium at 20 to 30. In size as in number the\r\nspores exceed those of recent species and agree more nearly with the\r\nmegaspores of _S. Suissei_.\r\n\r\nIt would seem to be a general rule that the spores (megaspores) of the\r\nfossil herbaceous species exceeded considerably in dimensions those\r\nof recent forms and on the other hand were smaller than those of the\r\nPalaeozoic arborescent species.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that some of the Mesozoic and Tertiary\r\nspecies included under _Lycopodites_ agree more closely with the\r\nrecent genus _Selaginella_ than with _Lycopodium_, but this does\r\nnot constitute an argument of any importance against the restricted\r\nuse of the designation _Selaginellites_ which we have adopted. From\r\na botanical point of view the various records of _Lycopodites_ and\r\n_Selaginellites_ have but a minor importance; they are not sufficiently\r\nnumerous to throw any light on questions of distribution in former\r\nperiods, nor is the preservation of the material such as to enable us\r\nto compare the fossil with recent types either as regards their anatomy\r\nor, except in a few cases, their sporangia and spores. The Palaeozoic\r\nspecies are interesting as revealing less reduction in the number of\r\nspores produced in the megasporangia. Among existing Pteridophytes the\r\ngenus _Isoetes_ agrees more closely than _Selaginella_, as regards\r\nthe number of megaspores in each sporangium, with such fossils as\r\n_Selaginellites Suissei_ and _S. elongatus_.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that in most Palaeozoic species heterospory had\r\nnot reached the same stage of development as in the recent genus\r\n_Selaginella_ in which the megaspores do not exceed four in each\r\nsporangium. In _Selaginellites primaevus_, however, the heterospory\r\nappears to be precisely of the same type as in existing species.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Lycostrobus.\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Lycostrobus_ has recently been instituted by\r\nNathorst[232] for certain specimens of a lycopodiaceous strobilus, from\r\nthe Rhaetic strata of Scania, which he formerly referred to the genus\r\n_Androstrobus_[233].\r\n\r\n\r\n               _Lycostrobus Scotti_ Nathorst. Fig. 139.\r\n\r\nThe fossil described under this name is of special interest as\r\naffording an example of a Mesozoic lycopodiaceous cone comparable in\r\nhabit and in size with some of the largest examples of Palaeozoic\r\nLepidostrobi, the cones of _Lepidodendron_. The Swedish fossil from\r\nUpper Rhaetic strata of Helsingborg (Scania) was originally designated\r\n_Androstrobus Scotti_, the generic name being adopted in view of the\r\nclose resemblance of the form of the strobilus to the male flower of\r\na Cycad. A more complete examination has shown that the bodies, which\r\nwere thought to be pollen-sacs—though Nathorst recognised certain\r\ndifferences between them and the pollen-sacs of lycopods—are the\r\nmegaspores of a lycopod. Microspores have also been identified. The\r\naxis of the cone has a breadth of 2 cm. with a peduncle which may be\r\nnaked or provided with a few small scales; the sporophyll region of\r\nthe axis reached a length of at least 12 cm. The spirally disposed\r\nsporophylls terminate in a rhombic distal end which may represent\r\nthe original termination or they may have been prolonged upwards as\r\nfree laminae. Each sporophyll bears on its upper face a single large\r\nsporangium containing either megaspores or microspores: the megaspores,\r\n0·55–0·60 mm. in diameter, are finely granulate and bear small warty\r\nthorns or more slender pointed appendages. The microspores, after\r\ntreatment with eau de Javelle, were found to measure 36–44μ while\r\nothers which had been treated with ammonia reached 54μ in diameter.\r\nNathorst describes the microspores as occurring in spherical groups\r\nor balls, which it is suggested may be compared with the groups of\r\nspores separated by strands of sterile tissue (trabeculae) in the\r\nlarge sporangia of _Isoetes_ (cf. fig. 133, H). If this comparison is\r\nsound it would point to a more complete septation of the sporangium in\r\n_Lycostrobus_ than in any recent species of _Isoetes_. The size of the\r\nstrobilus would seem to indicate the persistence into the Rhaetic era\r\nof an arborescent lycopodiaceous type; but the appearance and manner\r\nof preservation of the axis is interpreted by Nathorst as evidence of\r\na herbaceous rather than a woody structure. He is disposed to regard\r\n_Isoetes_ as the most nearly allied existing genus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 139. _Lycostrobus Scotti_, Nath. (After Nathorst;\r\n  ⅘ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nThe comparison made by Nathorst with _Isoetes_ is based on a\r\nresemblance between the spores of the two genera and on the evidence,\r\nwhich is not decisive, of the existence of sterile strands of tissue\r\nin the sporangia of _Lycostrobus_. This similarity is however hardly\r\nof sufficient importance to justify the inclusion of the Rhaetic\r\nstrobilus in the Isoetaceae. In size and in the arrangement and form\r\nof the sporophylls the cone presents a much closer resemblance to\r\n_Lepidodendron_ than to _Isoetes_. It is probably advisable to regard\r\nthis Rhaetic type simply as a lycopodiaceous genus which we are unable,\r\nwithout additional information, to assign to a particular position.\r\n\r\nThe opinion expressed by Professor Fliche[234] that the plant described\r\nby Schimper and Mougeot as _Caulopteris tessellata_, a supposed\r\ntree-fern stem, from Triassic rocks of Lorraine, is more probably a\r\nlarge lycopodiaceous stem, either a _Lepidodendron_ or a new genus, is\r\nworthy of note in reference to Nathorst’s account of _Lycostrobus_.\r\n\r\nIn habit the fossil strobilus may be compared with the Triassic genus\r\n_Pleuromeia_, but the position of the sporangia on the sporophylls\r\nconstitutes a well-marked difference. The most important result of\r\nNathorst’s skillful treatment of this interesting fossil by chemical\r\nmicroscopic methods is the demonstration of the existence of a large\r\nheterosporous type of lycopodiaceous cone in a Rhaetic flora.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Poecilitostachys.\r\n\r\nUnder this generic name M. Fliche[235] has briefly described a fertile\r\nlycopodiaceous shoot from the Triassic rocks of Epinal in France:\r\nthe type species _Poecilitostachys Hangi_ consists of a cylindrical\r\naxis, 10 cm. × 5 mm., deprived of leaves and terminating in a rounded\r\nreceptacle bearing a capitulum of bracts or fertile leaves. Detached\r\nmegasporangia containing small globular bodies found in association\r\nwith the capitulum are compared with the megasporangia of _Isoetes_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n                       Arborescent Lycopodiales.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the best known plants in the Palaeozoic floras are the genera\r\n_Lepidodendron_ and _Sigillaria_, types which are often spoken of as\r\nGiant Club-Mosses or as ancestors of existing species of _Lycopodium_\r\nand _Selaginella_. Of these genera, but more particularly of\r\n_Lepidodendron_, we possess abundant records in a condition which\r\nhave made it possible to obtain fairly complete information not only\r\nin regard to habit and external features but as to the anatomical\r\ncharacters of both vegetative and reproductive shoots. The structure\r\nof _Lepidodendron_ differs too widely from that of recent Club-Mosses\r\n(species of _Lycopodium_) to justify the statement that this\r\nprominent member of the Palaeozoic vegetation may be regarded as a\r\ndirect ancestor of any living plant. There is at least no doubt that\r\n_Lepidodendron_ and _Sigillaria_ must be included in the Pteridophyta.\r\nThe description by Dr Scott[236] of the genus _Lepidocarpon_, founded\r\non petrified specimens of strobili, demonstrated the existence of a\r\ntype of lycopodiaceous plant in the Carboniferous period distinguished\r\nfrom all living representatives of the group by the possession\r\nof integumented megaspores, which may fairly be styled seeds.\r\n_Lepidocarpon_ and another seed-bearing plant _Miadesmia_ are described\r\nunder a separate heading as lycopodiaceous types characterised by an\r\nimportant morphological feature, which among recent plants constitutes\r\na differentiating character between the Pteridophytes and the\r\nPhanerogams.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Lepidodendron.\r\n\r\n                             i. _General._\r\n\r\nThe genus _Lepidodendron_ included species comparable in size with\r\nexisting forest trees. A tapered trunk rose vertically to a height of\r\n100 feet or upwards from a dichotomously branched subterranean axis\r\nof which the spreading branches, clothed with numerous rootlets, grew\r\nin a horizontal direction probably in a swampy soil or possibly under\r\nwater. A description by Mr Rodway[237] of Lycopods on the border of a\r\nsavannah in Guiana forming a miniature forest of Pine-like Lycopodiums\r\nmight, with the omission of the qualifying adjective, be applied with\r\nequal force to a grove of Lepidodendra. The equal dichotomy of many of\r\nthe branches gave to the tree a habit in striking contrast to that of\r\nour modern forest trees, but, on the other hand, in close agreement\r\nwith that of such recent species of _Lycopodium_ as _L. cernuum_ (fig.\r\n123), _L. obscurum_ (fig. 124) and other types. Linear or oval cones\r\nterminated some of the more slender branches (fig. 188) agreeing in\r\nsize and form with the cones of the Spruce Fir and other conifers or\r\nwith the male flowers of species of _Araucaria_, _e.g. A. imbricata_.\r\nNeedle-like leaves, varying considerably in length in different\r\nspecies, covered the surface of young shoots in crowded spirals and\r\ntheir decurrent bases or leaf-cushions formed an encasing cylinder\r\ncontinuous with the outer cortex. The fact that leaves are usually\r\nfound attached only to branches of comparatively small diameter would\r\nseem to show that _Lepidodendron_, though an evergreen, did not retain\r\nits foliage even for so long a period as do some recent conifers.\r\n\r\nBy the activity of a zone of growing tissue encircling the cylinder of\r\nwood the main trunk and branches grew in thickness year by year: the\r\ngeneral uniformity in size of the secondary conducting elements affords\r\nno indication of changing seasons. As the branches grew stouter and\r\nshed their leaves the surface of the bark resembled in some degree that\r\nof a Spruce Fir and other species of _Picea_, in which the leaf-scars\r\nform the upper limit of prominent peg-like projections, which, at\r\nfirst contiguous and regular in contour, afterwards become less regular\r\nand separated by grooves (fig. 140) and at a later stage lose their\r\noutline as the bark is stretched to the tearing point (fig. 140, C).\r\nThe leafless branches of _Lepidodendron_ were covered with spirally\r\ndisposed oval cushions less peg-like and larger than the decurrent\r\nleaf-bases of _Picea_, which show in the upper third of their length\r\na clean-cut triangular area and swell out below into two prominent\r\ncheeks separated by a median groove and tapering with decreasing\r\nthickness to a pointed base, which in some forms (_e.g. Lepidodendron\r\nVeltheimianum_, fig. 185, C, D), is prolonged as a curved ridge to the\r\nsummit of a lower leaf-cushion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 140. _Picea excelsa._ Shoots of different ages\r\n  showing changes in the appearance of the leaf-cushions: a leaf\r\n  attached to a cushion in fig. A. (Slightly enlarged.)]\r\n\r\nA portion of the cushion below the triangular leaf-scar often shows\r\ntransverse gaping cracks or depressions (fig. 185, C) such as occur\r\non a smaller scale on the older cushions of a Fir twig (fig. 140).\r\nSecondary thickening, as in recent trees, is not confined to the\r\nvascular cylinder but at an early stage, frequently before there are\r\nany signs of secondary wood, the outer region of the broad cortex\r\nbecomes the seat of active cell-formation which results in the addition\r\nof a considerable thickness to the bark. At a later stage of increase\r\nin girth, the leaf-cushions are stretched apart and the original\r\nsurface-features become obliterated by vertical cracks and by the\r\nexfoliation of the superficial tissues[238].\r\n\r\nSome species of _Lepidodendron_ produced branches characterised by\r\nspiral or vertical series of scars; these in older shoots were replaced\r\nby depressions having a diameter of several inches and comparable in\r\nappearance, as also perhaps in manner of formation, with the scars\r\nleft on the stem of a Kauri Pine (_Agathis australis_)[239] on the\r\nabscission of lateral branches by a natural process. These shoots,\r\nknown as _Ulodendron_, are described in a subsequent section. (Page\r\n128.)\r\n\r\nA fully-grown _Lepidodendron_ must have been an impressive tree,\r\nprobably of sombre colour, relieved by the encircling felt of green\r\nneedles on the young pendulous twigs. The leaves of some species were\r\nsimilar to those of a fir while in others they resembled the filiform\r\nneedles of the Himalayan Pine (_Pinus longifolia_). The occasional\r\npresence of delicate hyphae in the tissues of _Lepidodendron_\r\ndemonstrates susceptibility to fungal pests.\r\n\r\nArchitecturally, if one may use the term, _Lepidodendron_ owed its\r\npower of resistance to the bending force of the wind to its stout\r\nouter bark formed of thick-walled elements produced by the activity of\r\na cylinder of cortical meristem (figs. 148, 172, etc.). The vascular\r\naxis, of insignificant diameter in proportion to the size of the stem\r\n(figs. 152, 153, 172, 181, A), must have played a subordinate part,\r\nfrom a mechanical point of view, as compared with the solid mass of\r\nwood of a Pine or an Oak.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nWithin the compass of a text-book it is impossible, even if it were\r\ndesirable, to include an account of the majority of the species of the\r\nwidely distributed Palaeozoic genus _Lepidodendron_. In spite of the\r\ngreat number of known species of this common member of Carboniferous\r\nfloras, our knowledge of the type as a whole is deficient in many\r\npoints, and such information as we possess needs systematising and\r\nextending by comparative treatment based on a re-examination of\r\navailable data.\r\n\r\nIn order to appreciate the meaning of certain external features\r\ncharacteristic of Lepidodendron stems it is essential to have some\r\nknowledge of the internal structure.\r\n\r\nA dual system of terminology has been unavoidably adopted for\r\nspecies of _Lepidodendron_: the majority of specific names have been\r\nassigned to fossils known only in the form of casts or impressions,\r\nwhile petrified fragments, which unfortunately seldom show the\r\nsurface-features, have received another set of names. A glance at the\r\nolder palaeobotanical literature reveals the existence of several\r\ngeneric designations, which fuller information has shown to have been\r\napplied to lepidodendroid shoots deprived of some of their superficial\r\ntissues before fossilisation and differing considerably in appearance\r\nfrom the more complete branches of the same species[240]. It has in\r\nsome instances been possible to correlate the two sets of specimens,\r\ncasts or impressions, showing external features, and petrified\r\nfragments. We may reasonably expect that future discoveries will enable\r\nus to piece together as definite specific types specimens at present\r\nlabelled with different names.\r\n\r\nA well-preserved leaf-cushion of a _Lepidodendron_—the most obvious\r\ndistinguishing feature of the genus—is rhomboidal or fusiform and\r\nvertically elongated (fig. 146, C, E; fig. 185, C, D): in exceptional\r\ncases it may reach a length of 8 cm. and a breadth of 2 cm. The\r\ncushion as a whole represents a prominent portion of the stem or\r\nbranch comparable with the elevation on the twig of a Spruce Fir and\r\nthe leaf-base of a _Lycopodium_ (cf. fig. 121, A, lower portion) which\r\nappears in a transverse section of a branch as a rounded prominence\r\n(cf. _Lycopodium_, fig. 125, A and H). Disregarding differences in\r\ndetail, a typical Lepidodendron leaf-cushion is characterised by a\r\nclearly defined smooth area often situated in the middle region (fig.\r\n146, C, _s_). This is the leaf-scar or place of attachment of the base\r\nof the leaf which was cut off by an absciss-layer while the branch was\r\ncomparatively young, as in recent forest trees and in some species of\r\nFerns. On the leaf-scar are three smaller scars or cicatricules, the\r\ncentral one is circular or more or less triangular in outline, the two\r\nlateral scars being usually oval or circular. The central pit marks\r\nthe position of the single vascular bundle which constituted the\r\nconducting tissue connecting the leaf with the main vascular system of\r\nthe stem. The two lateral scars (figs. 145, A, _p_; 146, C, _s_; 147,\r\n_p_) represent the exposed ends of two strands of tissue, the forked\r\nbranches of a strand which pass from the middle cortex of the stem into\r\nthe leaf; this is known as the parichnos, a name proposed by Professor\r\nBertrand in 1891[241].\r\n\r\nThe specimen shown in fig. 141 shows the linear leaves attached to\r\ntheir respective cushions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 141. _Lepidodendron Sternbergii._ From a specimen\r\n  in the British Museum (No. v. 1235) from the Coal-Measures of\r\n  Shropshire. (Nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nThe lamina has a well-defined median keel on the lower surface and\r\non either side a groove in which sections of petrified leaves have\r\ndemonstrated the occurrence of stomata (cf. fig. 142).\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ii. _Leaves and Leaf-cushions._\r\n\r\nAll Lepidodendron leaves, so far as we know, possessed a single\r\nmedian vein only. In some species, as for example in _Lepidodendron\r\nlongifolium_ Brongn., they have the form of long and slender\r\nacicular needles very similar to those of _Pinus longifolium_; in\r\n_L. Sternbergii_ (fig. 141) they are much broader and shorter. In\r\nexternal form as in internal structure it is often impossible to\r\ndistinguish between the leaves of _Lepidodendron_ and _Sigillaria_.\r\nThe distinguishing features enumerated by the late M. Renault cannot\r\nbe employed, with any great degree of confidence, as diagnostic\r\ncharacters. In transverse section the lamina of a Lepidodendron\r\nleaf presents the same appearance as that of the Sigillarian leaves\r\nrepresented in fig. 142. Near the base the free part of the leaf is\r\nusually sub-rhomboidal in section with short lateral wings, a ventral\r\nkeel and two stomatal grooves (fig. 142, A, B, _g_). The form and\r\narrangement of stomata are shown in fig. 143, A, which was drawn from\r\na piece of a leaf shown in surface-view in a section lent to me by\r\nProfessor Weiss. It should, however, be pointed out that the leaf\r\ncannot be certainly identified with _Lepidodendron_ rather than with\r\n_Sigillaria_, but as the leaves of these two genera are constructed on\r\nthe same plan the identification is of secondary importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 142. Leaves of _Sigillaria_ in transverse\r\n  section. A, A′. Section in the Manchester University Museum (Q.\r\n  631). B, C. Sections in Dr Kidston’s Collection.]\r\n\r\nThe single xylem bundle consists of primary tracheae only, at least in\r\nsuch laminae as have been identified as Lepidodendroid. Surrounding\r\nthe xylem strand occur delicate parenchymatous cells in some cases\r\naccompanied by darker and thicker-walled elements. As in _Sigillaria_,\r\nthe leaves of which are more fully described on page 210, a fairly\r\nbroad sheath of wider and shorter scalariform or spiral transfusion\r\ntracheids surrounds the conducting strand (figs. 142, _t_; 143, B, C,\r\n_t_). As Renault shows in the case of _Lepidodendron esnostense_[242],\r\nthe small leaves of which are 1·5–2 mm. broad at the base and several\r\ncentimetres long, the stomatal grooves and keel die out towards the\r\napex when the lamina assumes a more nearly circular form (fig. 143, C).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 143.\r\n\r\n  A.

(After Renault.)]\r\n\r\nThe area of the cushion excluding the leaf-scar is spoken of by some\r\nwriters as the field. Below the leaf-scar the kite-shaped cushion\r\ntapers to a gradually narrowing basal position: in _Lepidodendron\r\nVeltheimianum_, a species characteristic of Lower Carboniferous\r\nstrata, it is seen to be continuous, as a ridge with sloping sides,\r\nwith a lower cushion (fig. 185).\r\n\r\nBelow a leaf-scar the cushion frequently shows a pair of oval areas on\r\nwhich a fine pitting may be detected in well-preserved impressions,\r\nthese oval scars, as seen in fig. 185, D, are practically continuous\r\nat the upper end with the parichnos scars on the leaf-scar area;\r\nthis is explained by the fact that these infra-foliar scars also owe\r\ntheir existence to patches of lacunar, aerenchymatous tissue in close\r\nconnexion with the parichnos[243].\r\n\r\nShortly before entering the base of the leaf-lamina the parichnos\r\ndivides into two arms which diverge in the outer cortical region right\r\nand left of the vascular bundle, and passing obliquely upwards they\r\ncome close to the surface of the leaf-cushion just below the leaf-scar.\r\nThe diagram—fig. 144, B—shows a leaf-trace, _lt_, in the leaf-cushion,\r\nas seen in a diagrammatic drawing of a vertical radial section of a\r\nstem, the dotted lines, _p_, _p′_, show the two parichnos arms which\r\nare represented as impinging on the surface of the leaf-cushion at\r\n_p′_, and then bending upwards to pass into the leaf-base right and\r\nleft of the vascular bundle or leaf-trace. For convenience the arms of\r\nthe parichnos are represented in one plane though actually in different\r\nvertical planes.\r\n\r\nFig. 144, A, shows the difference between a view of the original\r\nsurface of a _Lepidodendron_, as at _a_, where a leaf-cushion with a\r\nleaf-scar is seen, and a view of an impression representing the outer\r\ncortex, _b_, a short distance below the surface. The surface _b_,\r\nin fig. 144, A, corresponds to the face _d_-_e_ in the diagrammatic\r\nlongitudinal section fig. 144, B: the outline of each cushion is\r\nclearly visible and in the centre is seen the leaf-trace, _lt_, with\r\nits parichnos.\r\n\r\nThe surface-features, _a_ (fig. 144, A), have been impressed on the\r\nrock, _c_, (fig. 144, B) in which the specimen was entombed and by the\r\nremoval of the cast of the stem, that is the thickness _b_ to _e_ in\r\nfig. 144, B, the form of the leaf-cushion is revealed. The presence of\r\nthe two infra-foliar parichnos scars at _p′_ (fig. 144, A) is explained\r\nby the diagram, fig. 144, B, _p′_.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the parichnos to the oval scars below a Lepidodendron\r\nleaf-cushion has been worked out in detail by Weiss who shows that, at\r\nleast in some species, the two arms do not bend downwards as shown in\r\nthe diagram, fig. 144, B, but pursue a straight gradually ascending\r\ncourse as seen in fig. 145, A. Just below the leaf-scar region of\r\nthe cushion each arm comes into association with a group of lacunar,\r\naerenchymatous tissue, such as occurs in the roots of certain Mangrove\r\nplants, and it is this aerenchyma which is exposed on the two oval\r\ndepressions below the leaf-scar. The structure of this aerenchyma\r\nis shown in fig. 145, B; it consists in this species (_L. Hickii_\r\nWats.) of stellate cells which would constitute an efficient aerating\r\nsystem. Probably, as Weiss suggests, these patches of aerenchyma were\r\noriginally covered by an epidermis provided with stomata, and it is\r\nowing to the destruction of this superficial layer that the two oval\r\nscars often form a prominent feature on Lepidodendron leaf-bases[244].\r\nThe diagram reproduced in fig. 144, B, may be taken as practically\r\ncorrect, as the patches of aerenchyma described by Weiss do not differ\r\nessentially from the parichnos tissue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 144. _Lepidodendron Veltheimianum_ Sternb.\r\n\r\n  A.

Diagrammatic surface-view and longitudinal section of a\r\n     Lepidodendron leaf-cushion.\r\n  B. Aerenchyma below the leaf-scar. (After F. E. Weiss.)]\r\n\r\nThe parichnos scars are shown on the leaf-scar and cushion in fig. 146,\r\nC. In the lower leaf-cushion shown in fig. 146, E, the infra-foliar\r\nparichnos scars, _p_, are clearly seen, but the preservation of\r\nthe leaf-scar is not sufficiently good to show them on that part\r\nof the fossil. In the upper cushion (fig. 146, E) the position of\r\nthe parichnos arms is shown on the leaf-scar, but the infra-foliar\r\nparichnos scars are hidden by two small spiral shells. The genus\r\n_Spirorbis_, to which these shells are referred, appears to have\r\npersisted from the Silurian epoch to the present day. The comparatively\r\nfrequent occurrence of _Spirorbis_ shells on the leaves and other\r\nparts of Palaeozoic plants, has recently been dealt with in a paper\r\nby Barrois[245] who discusses in detail the habitats of these small\r\nanimals from the point of view of the conditions under which the plants\r\nwere preserved. In a note by Malaquin appended to Barrois’ paper the\r\nbelief is expressed that _Spirorbis_ lived on pieces of Palaeozoic\r\nplants which lay under water.\r\n\r\nThe fact that with one exception all the Spirorbis shells on the\r\nspecimen of _Lepidodendron_, of which two leaf-cushions are shown in\r\nfig. 146, E, occur on the large parichnos scars on the cheeks of the\r\ncushions, suggests the possibility that the escape of gases from the\r\nparichnos tissue may have rendered the position attractive to the\r\n_Spirorbis_. It can hardly be accidental that the shells occur on the\r\nparichnos strands. This fact recalls the view held by Binney[246] and\r\naccepted with favour by Darwin[247] that _Lepidodendron_ and other\r\ncoal-forest trees may have lived with the lower parts of the stems in\r\nsea water.\r\n\r\nAbove the leaf-scar is a fairly deep triangular or crescentic pit\r\n(fig. 146, C, _l_) known as the ligular pit from the occurrence on\r\nyounger shoots of a delicate organ like the ligule of _Isoetes_ (fig.\r\n132) embedded in a depression in the upper part of the leaf-cushion.\r\nThe ligule was first figured in _Lepidodendron_ by Solms-Laubach[248]\r\nand described in English material by Williamson under the name of the\r\nadenoid organ[249].\r\n\r\nIn some Lepidodendron stems a second triangular depression may occur\r\nabove the ligular pit, the meaning of which is not clear: this has been\r\ncalled the triangulum by Potonié[250]. Stur[251] suggested that it may\r\nrepresent the position occupied by a sporangium in Lepidodendron cones.\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that as a branch increases in girth the\r\nleaf-cushions are capable of only a certain amount of growth: when\r\nthe limit is reached they are stretched farther apart and thus the\r\nnarrow groove which separates them is converted in older stems into\r\na comparatively broad and flat channel, thus altering the surface\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 146.

From sections in the Cambridge Botany School Collection.]\r\n\r\nAnother feature worthy of notice in reference to the leaf-cushions\r\nof _Lepidodendron_ is the occurrence in rare instances of alternate\r\nzones of larger and smaller cushions. This variation in the size of\r\nthe leaf-cushions is by no means uncommon in the closely allied genus\r\n_Sigillaria_; in _Lepidodendron_ it has been described by Potonié[252]\r\nin _L. volkmannianum_ and more recently by Mr Leslie and myself[253] in\r\na South African species _L. vereenigense_.\r\n\r\nOwing to the natural exfoliation of the superficial layers of the\r\nouter bark at a certain stage in the growth of the plant, or in\r\nsome instances no doubt as the result of _post-mortem_ decay, which\r\ndestroys the delicate cells of the meristematic zone in the outer\r\ncortex, isolated leaf-cushions and strips of the external surface are\r\noccasionally met with as carbonised impressions.\r\n\r\nThe appearance presented by a Lepidodendron stem which has been\r\ndeprived of its superficial tissues may be dealt with more intelligibly\r\nafter we have become familiar with the anatomical characters.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         iii. _Lepidophloios_.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further with the genus _Lepidodendron_ a\r\nshort account may be intercalated of the external features of a\r\nlepidodendroid type of stem which it is customary to describe under a\r\ndistinct generic title _Lepidophloios_. This name is convenient for\r\ndiagnostic purposes though it seems clear that apart from the form of\r\nthe leaf-cushion (fig. 146, A) we are at present unable to recognise\r\nany well-defined differences between the two forms _Lepidodendron_ and\r\n_Lepidophloios_. For general purposes the name _Lepidodendron_ will be\r\nused as including plants possessing leaf-cushions of the type already\r\ndescribed as well as those with the Lepidophloios form of cushion.\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Lepidophloios_ was first used by Sternberg[254]\r\nfor a Carboniferous species which he had previously described as\r\n_Lepidodendron laricinum_. In 1845 Corda[255] instituted the name\r\n_Lomatophloios_ for specimens possessing the same external characters\r\nas those for which Sternberg had chosen the name _Lepidophloios_.\r\nThe leaf-cushions of _Lepidophloios_ differ from those of the true\r\n_Lepidodendron_ in their relatively greater lateral extension (cf.\r\nfig. 146, A and C), in their imbricate arrangement and in bearing\r\nthe leaf, or leaf-scar, at the summit. In some species referred to\r\n_Lepidophloios_ the cushions are however vertically elongated and\r\nin this respect similar to those of _Lepidodendron_: an example of\r\nthis type is afforded by _Lepidophloios Dessorti_ a French species\r\ndescribed by Zeiller[256]. In younger branches the cushions may be\r\ndirected upwards having the leaf-scar at the top; but in the majority\r\nof specimens the cushions are deflexed as in figs. 146, D; 160, A. The\r\nshoot of _Lycopodium dichotomum_ shown in fig. 121, B, with the leaves\r\nin the reversed position bears a close resemblance to a branch of\r\n_Lepidophloios_.\r\n\r\nThe photograph of _Lepidophloios scoticus_ Kidst.[257] reproduced in\r\nfig. 160, A, illustrates the dichotomous branching of the stem and the\r\nform of the cushions with the leaf-scars pointing downwards. In the\r\nfertile branch of the same species shown in fig. 160, B, the leaf-scars\r\nface upwards.\r\n\r\nIn most species the cushions are simply convex without a median keel,\r\nbut in some cases a median ridge divides the cushion into two cheeks as\r\nin the genus _Lepidodendron_. The leaf-scar bears three small scars,\r\nthe larger median scar marking the position of the leaf-trace, while\r\nthe lateral scars are formed by the two arms of the parichnos: in some\r\nexamples of deflexed cushions, though not in all, a ligular pit occurs\r\non the cushion a short distance above the leaf-scar.\r\n\r\nThe drawing reproduced in fig. 146, A, showing the leaf-scar on the\r\nupper edge of the cushion should have been reversed with the leaf-scars\r\npointing downwards. This figure represents part of the surface of a\r\nspecimen consisting of the outer cortex of a stem with leaf-cushions 3\r\ncm. broad. The thickness of this specimen is 4 cm.: a section through\r\nthe line _ab_ is represented in fig. 146, D (reproduced in the correct\r\nposition, with the leaf-scars, _sc_, pointing downwards): internal\r\nto the cushions is a band of secondary cortex (the shaded strip on\r\nthe outer edge of the section) which was formed on the outside of\r\nthe phellogen. The phellogen is a cylinder of actively dividing cells\r\nin the outer part of the cortex of the stem, often spoken of as the\r\ncork-cambium or cortical meristem, which produces a considerable amount\r\nof secondary cortical tissue on its inner face and a much smaller\r\namount towards the stem surface. This delicate cylinder frequently\r\nforms a natural line of separation between the outer shell of bark and\r\nthe rest of the stem. In the specimen before us, the thin-walled cells\r\nof the phellogen were ruptured before petrification and the outer shell\r\nof bark was thus separated as a hollow cylinder from the rest of the\r\nstem: this cylinder was then flattened, the two inner surfaces coming\r\ninto contact. Fig. 146, D, represents a section of one half of the\r\nthickness of the flattened shell.\r\n\r\nThis separation of the outer cortex, and its preservation apart\r\nfrom the rest of the stem, is of frequent occurrence in fossil\r\nlycopodiaceous stems. The flattened outer cortical shell of a\r\n_Lepidophloios_, specifically identical with that shown in fig. 146, A\r\nand D, was erroneously described by Dr C. E. Weiss in 1881 as a large\r\nlepidodendroid cone[258].\r\n\r\nFig. 146, B, affords a view of the inner face of the specimen of which\r\nthe outer surface is seen in fig. 146, A: the surface shown in the\r\nlower part of the drawing, on which the boundaries of the cushions are\r\nrepresented by a reticulum, corresponds to the inner edge of the strip\r\nof secondary cortical tissue represented by the vertically shaded band\r\nin fig. 146, D.\r\n\r\nThe shaded surface in fig. 146, B, represents a slightly deeper level\r\nin the stem which corresponds to the outer edge of the vertically\r\nshaded band of fig. 146, D: the narrow tapered ridges (fig. 146, B)\r\nrepresent the leaf-traces passing through the secondary cortex, and the\r\nfine vertical shading indicates the elongated elements of which this\r\nstrip of secondary cortex is composed.\r\n\r\nIn the longitudinal section diagrammatically reproduced in fig. 146,\r\nD, cut along the line _ab_ of fig. 146, A, the parenchymatous tissue\r\nof the stout cushions has been partially destroyed, as at _a_; at\r\n_s_ is seen the section of a Stigmarian rootlet which has found its\r\nway into the interior of a cushion. Each leaf-trace is accompanied\r\nby a parichnos strand as in the true _Lepidodendron_; at the base of\r\nthe leaf-cushion the parichnos branches into two arms which diverge\r\nslightly right and left of the leaf-trace, finally entering the base of\r\nthe leaf lamina as two lateral strands (fig. 147, _p_). At one point\r\nin fig. 146, D the section has shaved a leaf-trace represented by a\r\nblack patch resting on the parichnos just above the line _ef_, but it\r\npasses through one of the parichnos arms _p′_ which debouches on to the\r\nleaf-scar _sc_ at _p_. Had the section been cut along the line _cd_ of\r\nfig. 146, A the leaf-trace would have been seen in a position similar\r\nto that occupied by the parichnos _p′_ in fig. 146, D.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 147. _Lepidophloios_ leaf-cushion in tangential\r\n  section. (From a section in the Williamson Collection, British\r\n  Museum, No. 1973.)]\r\n\r\nFig. 147, A, affords a good example of a tangential section through\r\na _Lepidophloios_ leaf-cushion, 1 cm. broad, like that represented\r\nin fig. 146, A, showing the vascular bundle _lt_, the two parichnos\r\nstrands, _p_, composed of large thin-walled cells (cf. _Isoetes_, fig.\r\n133, H, I), and the ligular pit near the upper edge of the section\r\nenclosing the shrunken remains of the ligule (fig. 147, B, _l_).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LEPIDODENDRON]\r\n\r\nFig. 147, B, shows the form of the tangentially elongated leaf-cushions\r\nof _Lepidophloios_ and their spiral disposition.\r\n\r\nFig. 146, F, represents a section similar to that shown in figs. 147,\r\nA and B, but in this case the leaf-trace, _lt_, and the parichnos\r\nstrands, _p_, lie in a cavity formed by the destruction of some of the\r\nleaf-cushion tissue. It is worthy of notice that the parichnos cells\r\nhave resisted decay more successfully than the adjacent tissue of the\r\ncushion.\r\n\r\nThe diagrammatic sketches reproduced in fig. 146, H and I, were\r\nmade from a transverse section similar to one originally figured by\r\nWilliamson[259]: fig. 146, H, corresponding in position to the line\r\n_gh_ in fig. 146, A, passes through the ligular pit, _l_, and cuts\r\nacross the parichnos in the act of branching; the leaf-trace passes\r\noutwards beyond the =Y=-shaped parichnos strand. In the other section,\r\nfig. 146, I, the parichnos is shown in a horizontal plane and the\r\nleaf-trace, _lt_, appears in oblique transverse section. In both\r\nsections and in fig. 146, G the shaded band at the base represents the\r\nsecondary cortical tissue external to the phellogen.\r\n\r\nThe transverse section represented in fig. 146, G, shows in the\r\nleft-hand cushion, _a_, the exit of the two parichnos arms and the\r\nleaf-trace between them: it illustrates also the various forms assumed\r\nby lepidodendroid leaf-cushions when cut across at different levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n      iv. _The Anatomy_ of Lepidodendron vasculare _Binney_[260].\r\n                        Figs. 148–155, 168, A.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier literature dealing with the anatomy of _Lepidodendron_\r\nand _Sigillaria_ the presence or absence of secondary vascular tissue\r\nwas made the criterion of generic distinction and the distinguishing\r\nfeature between the classes Pteridophytes and Gymnosperms,\r\n_Lepidodendron_ being relegated to the former class because it\r\nwas supposed to have no power of forming secondary wood, while\r\n_Sigillaria_, characterised by a considerable development of such\r\ntissue, was classed by Brongniart and afterwards by Renault as a\r\nGymnosperm. Binney[261] in 1865 recognised that the two types of stem\r\npass into one another, but it was Williamson[262] who provided complete\r\ndemonstration of the fallacy of the Brongniartian view.\r\n\r\nThese two undoubted Pteridophytes agree very closely in anatomical\r\nstructure and both are now recognised as arborescent genera of\r\nLycopodiaceous plants. In a paper published by Lomax and Weiss\r\nin 1905[263] a specimen is described from the Coal-Measures of\r\nHuddersfield, in which a decorticated stem with the anatomical\r\ncharacters of Binney’s _Sigillaria vascularis_ gives off a branch\r\nhaving the anatomical structure which it has been customary to\r\nassociate with the species _Lepidodendron selaginoides_, so-called by\r\nSternberg and founded by him on impressions showing well-preserved\r\nexternal characters.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 Binney[264] described petrified specimens of vegetative shoots\r\nfrom the Lower Coal-Measures of Lancashire under the names _Sigillaria\r\nvascularis_ and _Lepidodendron vasculare_. These were afterwards\r\nrecognised as different states of the same species. A few years after\r\nthe publication of Binney’s paper Carruthers[265] identified Binney’s\r\nspecies _Lepidodendron vasculare_ with Sternberg’s _L. selaginoides_.\r\nThe evidence on which this identification rests has not been stated,\r\nbut many writers have retained this specific designation for the\r\nwell-defined type of anatomical structure first described by Binney\r\nas _L. vasculare_. The use of the specific name _selaginoides_ is,\r\nhowever, open to objection. The species _Lepidodendron selaginoides_,\r\nas pointed out by Kidston[266], is probably identical with the plant\r\nwhich Brongniart had named _L. Sternbergii_ before the institution\r\nof Sternberg’s species, and we are not in possession of convincing\r\nevidence as to the connection of _L. Sternbergii_ (= _L. selaginoides_)\r\nwith specimens possessing the anatomy of Binney’s type. Binney’s\r\ndesignation is therefore retained for the anatomical type described in\r\nthe following pages[267].\r\n\r\nThe most detailed account hitherto published of the anatomy of\r\n_Lepidodendron vasculare_ is that by the late M. Hovelacque[268], based\r\non material from the Lower Coal-Measures of England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 148. _Lepidodendron vasculare_ Binney.\r\n\r\n  A. Transverse section. (Based on a section 2·5 cm. in diameter, in\r\n     the Cambridge Botany School Collection.)\r\n  B. Longitudinal section. (Drawn from a section in Dr Kidston’s\r\n     Collection.)]\r\n\r\nThe small shoot, represented somewhat diagrammatically in fig. 148,\r\nA, illustrates the anatomical features of a typical example of the\r\nspecies: the shoot has a diameter of 2·5 cm. and its central cylinder\r\n(_x_-_sc_) is 2·5 mm. in width.\r\n\r\nNoticeable features are (i) the small size of the central cylinder\r\n(or stele) in proportion to the diameter of the branch, (ii) the\r\nproduction at a comparatively early stage of growth of a zone of\r\nsecondary wood, _x_², which gradually assumes the form of a complete\r\ncylinder of unequal breadth, surrounding the primary xylem, _x_,\r\n(iii) the formation of a secondary cortical tissue by a meristematic\r\ncylinder (phellogen, _pl_) situated close to the leaf-cushion region\r\nof the outer cortex. On the outer edge the stele consists of narrow\r\ntracheae some of which show in longitudinal section the spiral form\r\nof thickening characteristic of most protoxylem elements: towards\r\nthe centre of the stele the diameter of the tracheae gradually\r\nincreases and parenchymatous cells become associated with the\r\nelongated scalariform elements. In the central region the stele is\r\ncomposed of parenchymatous tissue arranged in vertical series of short\r\ncells, interspersed with short tracheae distinguished by the greater\r\nthickness of their walls and by their scalariform and reticulate\r\nthickening bands. Some of these short tracheae are shown in vertical\r\nsection in fig. 149, B: the fine and broken lines connecting adjacent\r\nthickening bands probably represent the remains of the original wall.\r\nThese delicate bands, which have been figured in various species of\r\nlepidodendroid plants[269], are worthy of notice in connexion with the\r\nrecent work of Mr Gwynne-Vaughan[270] who has shown that in many recent\r\nferns the scalariform bands in the xylem elements are not connected\r\nby a thin pit-closing membrane, but are separated from one another by\r\nopen spaces. In the Lepidodendron tracheae we seem to have a stage in\r\nwhich the intervening membrane is in process of absorption. It is,\r\nhowever, possible that the threads may be the result of contraction and\r\nsplitting of the membrane during drying or decay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 149. _Lepidodendron vasculare_. _a_, immature\r\n  tracheae; _m_, meristem; _mr_, medullary ray; _x_, xylem.\r\n\r\n  A. Longitudinal section through the edge of the secondary wood.\r\n  B. Short tracheae in the centre of the stele. (From a specimen from\r\n     the Halifax Hard bed in Dr Kidston’s Collection.)]\r\n\r\nThe stele of _Lepidodendron vasculare_, before the addition of any\r\nsecondary xylem, may be described as a protostele, a term originally\r\nproposed by Professor Jeffrey[271], in which the central part of the\r\nconducting strand of xylem elements has been converted into rows of\r\nparenchyma and short tracheids, the latter being better adapted to\r\nstorage than to conduction. It is probable that this type of stelar\r\nanatomy, which distinguishes _L. vasculare_ from other species,\r\nrepresents a comparatively primitive arrangement forming a transition\r\nbetween the stele of _L. esnostense_, which consists of a solid rod\r\nof tracheids, and the stele of _L. Harcourtii_ (fig. 179, A) and\r\nother species in which the xylem forms a cylinder enclosing a large\r\nparenchymatous pith.\r\n\r\nParenchymatous cells occur in contact with the outer edge of the\r\nxylem-cylinder some of which are distinguished by an irregular\r\nreticulate pitting. The tangential section represented in fig. 148, B,\r\nillustrates the appearance of a shoot of _L. vasculare_ in which no\r\nsecondary xylem is present: the central strand of tissue consists of\r\nthe parenchyma abutting on the xylem with several leaf-traces (_lt_)\r\npassing upwards in an almost vertical course from the outer edge of the\r\nstele.\r\n\r\nThe secondary xylem (fig. 148, A, _x_²) consists of radially arranged\r\nscalariform tracheae with associated rows of parenchymatous cells which\r\nform medullary rays (fig. 149, _mr_). Leaf-traces pass through the\r\nmedullary rays in the secondary xylem cylinder in a direction at right\r\nangles to the primary xylem stele from which they are given off, but at\r\nthe outer edge of the secondary xylem they bend suddenly upwards and\r\nfor a time follow a steep and almost vertical course.\r\n\r\nIn well-preserved longitudinal sections the outermost secondary xylem\r\ntracheae are seen to be succeeded by a few narrow and vertically\r\nelongated elements (fig. 149, A, _a_), which represent young\r\nunlignified tracheae: these are followed by shorter parenchymatous\r\ncells (_m_) forming part of a meristematic zone from which the\r\nsecondary xylem receives additions.\r\n\r\nReturning to fig. 148, A; the zone of secondary wood, _x_², composed\r\nof scalariform tracheids and medullary rays, is succeeded by a few\r\nlayers of parenchymatous cells and beyond this is a broader zone, _sc_,\r\nto which the term secretory zone has been applied[272]; this is made\r\nup of small parenchymatous cells varying in size and of larger spaces\r\nwhich appear to have been formed by the disorganisation of thin-walled\r\nelements. The whole zone presents a characteristic appearance due to\r\nthe association of small cells, large clear spaces, and a certain\r\namount of dark-coloured material suggestive of tissue disorganisation\r\nand secreted products. The anatomical characters of the secretory zone\r\nare shown in the photograph, fig. 168, A, _sc_. Several leaf-traces\r\nare seen in transverse section in the secretory zone (black dots in\r\nfig. 148, A, _sc_; fig. 154, C, _lt_): each trace consists of a strand\r\nof narrow tracheae accompanied by a few encircling layers of small\r\nparenchymatous cells. As a trace continues its steeply ascending course\r\nthrough the secretory zone, it becomes associated with a strand of\r\nthat tissue and assumes the form of a collateral vascular bundle, the\r\nouter part of which does not consist of typical phloem but of shorter\r\nelements derived from the secretory zone. Beyond the secretory zone\r\nwe find a more homogeneous tissue composed of parenchymatous elements\r\nslightly extended tangentially (figs. 148, A, _c_¹; fig. 168, A, _c_);\r\nthis is spoken of as the inner cortical region. In the great majority\r\nof sections of _L. vasculare_ as of other species of the genus, the\r\nbroader middle cortex (fig. 148, _c_²) is occupied by mineral matter,\r\nintroduced subsequent to decay of the tissue; or it is represented by\r\npatches of delicate tissue composed of loosely arranged parenchymatous\r\ncells varying considerably in size and shape, some being small, oval\r\nor polygonal elements while others have the form of sinuous hypha-like\r\ntubes.\r\n\r\nIn this middle cortical region may be seen leaf-traces passing outwards\r\nin an almost horizontal course (fig. 148, A, _lt_): after leaving the\r\ninner cortex the leaf-traces bend somewhat abruptly outwards to follow\r\na more direct path through the middle and outer cortex. The ring of\r\ntissue, _s_, seen in the middle cortex of fig. 148, A, belongs to a\r\nStigmarian rootlet.\r\n\r\nThe outer cortex (fig. 148, A and B, _c_³) consists of homogeneous\r\nparenchyma which is stronger and more resistant to decay than the\r\nlooser middle cortex. The leaf-traces, as shown in fig. 148, B, pass\r\nthrough this region in a rather steeply ascending direction: each is\r\nseen to be enclosed by a space originally occupied by a strand of\r\nmiddle cortical tissue which accompanies lepidodendroid leaf-traces on\r\ntheir under side and has already been described as the parichnos, (pp.\r\n97, 100–103; figs. 146, 147).\r\n\r\nThe surface of the stem shown in section in fig. 148, A, is composed of\r\nbroad leaf-cushions. A single leaf-trace with its parichnos passes into\r\neach cushion, but in the neighbourhood of the base of a cushion the\r\nparichnos bifurcates (cf. fig. 146, H, I) and the arms diverge slightly\r\nto the right and left finally passing beyond the cushion into the\r\nlamina of the leaf, their position being shown, as already explained,\r\nby the two small lateral scars on the leaf-scar area.\r\n\r\nThe diagrammatic sketch of a radial longitudinal section through a\r\nleaf-cushion represented in fig. 150 illustrates the relation of the\r\nleaf-trace to the leaf-cushion. The trace consists of xylem, _x_, above\r\nand a strand of the secretory zone, _st_, below; the parichnos tissue\r\nwas originally present on the under side of the leaf-trace at _a_. The\r\nexternal surface, _bc_, marks the limit of the leaf-scar through the\r\nmiddle of which passes the vascular strand _lt_.\r\n\r\nThe lower gap _a_ has been formed by the tearing of thin-walled cells\r\nof the phellogen, the meristematic tissue from which a considerable\r\namount of secondary cortical tissue or phelloderm has been produced\r\nat _pd_. On the outside of the cushion, _c_, the cells are somewhat\r\ncrushed and distinguished by their darker colour from the bulk of the\r\nparenchymatous tissue _d_.\r\n\r\nThis section also illustrates another characteristic feature of\r\n_Lepidodendron_, namely the presence of a ligule and a ligular pit:\r\nthe former is represented by a carbonised patch of tissue and the\r\nlatter extends from the surface of the cushion at _b_, just above the\r\nleaf-scar, almost to the level of the leaf-trace, _lt_. A comparison of\r\nthis section with figs. 146 and 147 will make clear the relation of the\r\nseveral parts of the cushion and leaf-scar.\r\n\r\nThe gaps _gg_, seen in fig. 148, A and B, mark the position of the\r\ndelicate meristematic zone or phellogen which arises close to the bases\r\nof the leaf-cushions; the phellogen has already produced a few rows of\r\nradially disposed elements, represented by short radial lines in the\r\ndrawing, which constitute secondary cortical tissue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 150. _Lepidodendron vasculare_. Leaf-cushions in\r\n  longitudinal section. (From a specimen in Dr Kidston’s Collection.)]\r\n\r\nIn older shoots the amount of the secondary cortical tissue developed\r\non the inner side of the phellogen is considerable (cf. figs. 152, 153).\r\n\r\nThe structure of the cortex of a shoot in which secondary growth, both\r\nin the stele and in the outer cortex, has progressed further than in\r\nthe specimen shown in fig. 148 is represented in fig. 151.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 151. _Lepidodendron vasculare_. An older stem than\r\n  that shown in fig. 148. (From a section in the Manchester Museum.\r\n  No. 351.)]\r\n\r\nThe section (fig. 151, A) measures 7 × 3·8 cm. in diameter; the\r\nprimary xylem is surrounded by a fairly broad cylinder of secondary\r\nwood (fig. 151, E, _x_ and _x²_). The almost smooth surface of the\r\nprimary wood (fig. 151, E, _x_) is succeeded by the secondary xylem,\r\n_x²_, characterised at its inner edge by the tapered ends of the\r\nradial rows of scalariform tracheids between which occur several\r\ndelicate parenchymatous cells (fig. 151, E, _a_). The occurrence\r\nof such isodiametric elements, often exhibiting a delicate spiral\r\nthickening band, is a characteristic feature of the boundary between\r\nprimary and secondary wood in lepidodendroid stems. The secondary wood\r\nis penetrated by numerous medullary rays and in some of them are seen\r\nstrands of narrow spirally thickened tracheae—the leaf-traces—which\r\nare in organic continuity with the exarch protoxylem of the primary\r\nwood. The leaf-traces are oval and mesarch. The space, _c²_, (fig.\r\n151, A) originally occupied by the delicate middle cortex, is succeeded\r\nby a shell of outer cortex composed chiefly of secondary tissue\r\n(phelloderm, _pd_) passing towards the inner boundary of this region\r\ninto the primary outer cortex _g_ (fig. 151, A and C). The radially\r\ndisposed elements which make up the bulk of the phelloderm are\r\nassociated with concentric rows of secretory strands, represented by\r\ntangentially arranged dots in fig. 151, A: on the outer edge of the\r\nphelloderm a few patches of primary cortex are still preserved, as at\r\n_c_, fig. A. One of these is shown on a larger scale in fig. B; at _m_\r\nthe phelloderm is interrupted by a gap beyond which the cells have\r\nthinner walls and show signs of recent division; this is probably the\r\nposition of the phellogen. The tissue _b_, fig. 151, B, consists of\r\nsecondary cortex succeeded beyond _d_ by the parenchymatous tissue of\r\nthe leaf-cushion, in which the remains of a ligule, _l_, are seen in\r\nthe ligular pit. This section corresponds in position to a line drawn\r\nacross fig. 150 at the level of _b_. In this specimen we have two kinds\r\nof secondary cortical tissue: that formed external to the phellogen,\r\nfrom _m_ to _d_ in fig. 151, B, is less in amount than that produced\r\ninternal to the phellogen. We cannot make any satisfactory statement\r\nas to the nature of this secondary tissue, whether or not any of it\r\nagreed in composition with the cork which is usually formed external to\r\nthe phellogen in recent plants. As the stem of a _Lepidodendron_ grew\r\nin girth the leaf-cushions became separated by intervening depressions\r\ncomposed of the secondary cortex formed external to the phellogen, but\r\nat a later stage the cushions were thrown off, leaving the outer edge\r\nof the phelloderm as the superficial tissue. This exposed tissue became\r\nfissured as growth and consequent stretching continued, producing the\r\nappearance seen on the surface of the still older stem represented in\r\nfig. 153.\r\n\r\nThe inner edge of the phelloderm seen at _e_ in fig. 151, C, passes\r\nsuddenly into the inner primary region of the outer cortex (fig. 151, A\r\nand C, _g_) which comprises two types of parenchymatous tissue, patches\r\nof isodiametric cells, _g_, _g_, alternating with radially arranged\r\nareas consisting of tangentially elongated elements (fig. C, _f_, _f_;\r\nfig. D) which extend as wedges into the phelloderm.\r\n\r\nThe longitudinal section represented in fig. 152, B, shows an equal\r\nbifurcation of a stem in which no secondary xylem is present; in the\r\nlower part of the section the xylem and the outgoing leaf-traces are\r\nseen in radial section and at the upper end of each arm the leaf-traces\r\nalone, _lt_, are exposed, as in fig. 148, B. It is interesting to\r\nnotice the large amount of phelloderm which has been produced in the\r\nfork of the branch, at _pd_, where greater strength is required.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 152.  _Lepidodendron vasculare._ Sections of\r\n  dichotomously branched shoot.\r\n\r\n  A. From a section (10·5 × 9 cm.) in the Cambridge Botany School\r\n     Collection.\r\n  B. From a section (8 cm. long) in the Cambridge Collection.]\r\n\r\nThe section represented diagrammatically in fig. 152, A, has lost the\r\noutermost part of the cortex together with the leaf-cushions; it\r\nconsists largely of secondary cortex composed of radially disposed\r\nphelloderm cells and tangentially placed secretory strands (represented\r\nby the discontinuous black lines in the drawing): the dotted region\r\nin the central part of the axis is composed of primary cortical\r\nparenchyma, and the two spaces surrounding the steles contain portions\r\nof the lacunar middle cortex. Each stele possesses a narrow crescentic\r\nzone of secondary xylem; the amount is greater in the case of the\r\nright-hand stele, of which a small piece is shown on a larger scale;\r\nthe striking contrast in size between the outer and more internal\r\nsecondary tracheae is no doubt the expression of some unfavourable\r\ncondition of growth. The position of the secretory zone beyond the\r\nsecondary xylem is shown at _sc_, fig. 152, A.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 153. _Lepidodendron vasculare._\r\n  (From a specimen (16 × 7·5 cm.) in the Manchester Museum.)]\r\n\r\nAn example of a large and partially decorticated stem is afforded by\r\nthe specimen (16 × 7·5 cm.) shown in fig. 153. The irregularly ribbed\r\nsurface is formed of rather thick-walled phelloderm, in which occur\r\ntangentially arranged rows of secretory strands. The tapered form of\r\nthe secondary cortex as it abuts internally on the primary cortex is\r\nshown very clearly in the drawing (cf. fig. 151, C). The stele in this\r\nmuch older stem consists mainly of secondary wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 154. _Lepidodendron vasculare._ Shoot (2·8 cm.\r\n  diam.) with two steles.\r\n\r\n  (From a specimen from Halifax in the Williamson Collection, British\r\n  Museum, No. 340.)]\r\n\r\nAn interesting example of a small shoot, the largest diameter of which\r\nis 2·8 cm., is shown in fig. 154, A: the section was cut a short\r\ndistance above the bifurcation of the stele into two approximately\r\nequal branches. The outer part of the cortex consists of phelloderm,\r\n_pd_, with the usual rows of secretory tracts, and primary outer\r\ncortex _g_; the middle cortex is represented by patches of parenchyma\r\nwith a few leaf-traces. To one of the steles, _s′_ (fig. 154, A), a\r\ncrescent-shaped band of secondary xylem has been added; the other\r\nstele, _S_, possesses no fully developed secondary elements.\r\n\r\nFig. 154, B and C, illustrates the anatomical features immediately\r\nexternal to the primary xylem of the smaller stele, _s_. The\r\ncomparatively broad band of radially disposed parenchyma, _m_, is\r\nconnected with the outermost elements of the xylem by a few rather\r\ndark and small crushed parenchymatous cells. The band _m_, which we\r\nmay speak of as the meristematic zone, clearly consists of cells in a\r\nstate of division; it is in this region that the secondary xylem is\r\nproduced. Beyond the leaf-trace, (fig. 154, C, _lt_), occurs a portion\r\nof the secretory zone, some of the smaller cells of which show signs\r\nof disorganisation; but most of this tissue has been destroyed (fig.\r\n154, B, _sc_). The outer edge of the secretory zone is shown in fig.\r\n154, D abutting on the cells of the inner cortex, _c′_. The leaf-trace\r\nshown in the inner cortex in fig. 154, B illustrates the more oval or\r\ntangentially extended form of the xylem in this region, in contrast to\r\nthe more circular outline which it exhibits on the inner side of the\r\nsecretory zone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 155. _Lepidodendron vasculare_. Outer edge of\r\n  secondary xylem: _m_, meristematic zone; _mr_, medullary ray.\r\n  (Drawn from the section shown in fig. 168, A).]\r\n\r\nThe transverse section, part of which is reproduced in fig. 168, A,\r\nillustrates a characteristic feature, namely the juxtaposition of the\r\noutermost tracheae of the secondary xylem and much smaller cells of\r\nthe meristematic zone. This is seen in fig. 155, which shows a small\r\npiece of fig. 168, A, on a larger scale. In plants with a normal\r\ncambium the segments cut off from the initial layer fit on to the\r\nelements of the xylem or phloem to which they are to form additions,\r\nbut in _Lepidodendron_ it seems to be a general rule to find each\r\nof the most external lignified elements abutting on a group of two\r\nor three much smaller cells. It is difficult to believe that the\r\nmeristem shown in fig. 155, _m_, could produce secondary xylem elements\r\nequal in size to those already formed: in all probability had growth\r\ncontinued there would have been a marked difference between the size\r\nof the secondary tracheids, as in fig. 152, A, _x²_, where there was\r\nno doubt some cause which interfered with normal cambial activity.\r\nThis disparity in size between the secondary xylem elements and the\r\nadjacent parenchymatous tissue of the meristematic zone is by no means\r\nexceptional and may be described as the general rule. It is at least\r\ncertain that in _Lepidodendron vasculare_, as in other species, the\r\nsecondary xylem was succeeded by a broad band of parenchymatous tissue,\r\nfrom which new tracheae and medullary-ray elements were produced, and\r\nnot by a narrow cambium such as occurs in recent plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n          v. Lepidodendron _stems as represented by casts and\r\n           impressions of partially decorticated specimens._\r\n\r\nThe differentiation of the outer cortex of a _Lepidodendron_ into\r\ncomparatively thin-walled and more resistant tissue has been the cause\r\nof unequal decay and the consequent formation of shrinkage cavities. In\r\naddition to the unequal resisting power of contiguous tissues, another\r\nimportant factor in determining the nature of casts and impressions is\r\nthe existence of the cylinder of delicate cells in the outer cortex of\r\nstems and branches. As already pointed out, this meristematic cylinder\r\nor phellogen constitutes a natural line of separation, as in the case\r\nof the cambium layer between the wood and the external tissues in a\r\nfresh Sycamore twig. The result of the separation of an outer shell of\r\nbark from the rest of the stem and the results of unequal decay in the\r\nmore superficial tissues, have necessarily led to the preservation of\r\nthe same specific type under a variety of forms.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the anatomy of Lepidodendron stems enables us to\r\nrecognise in fossils of very different appearance specimens in various\r\nconditions of preservation of one and the same type. Such names as\r\n_Knorria_, _Bergeria_ and _Aspidiaria_ are examples of generic titles\r\ninstituted before any adequate knowledge of Lepidodendron anatomy was\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nDifferences in age as well as different degrees of decortication have\r\ncontributed in no small measure to the institution of generic and\r\nspecific names which more recently acquired knowledge has shown to be\r\nsuperfluous.\r\n\r\n\r\n_a._ _Knorria._\r\n\r\nThe designation Knorria, after a certain G. W. Knorr of Nürnberg, was\r\nproposed by Sternberg in 1826[273] for casts of Palaeozoic stems of a\r\ntype figured more than a century earlier by Volkmann[274]. Goeppert, in\r\nhis earlier works, published drawings of fossil stems which he referred\r\nto Sternberg’s genus: one species he at first called _Didymophyllum\r\nSchollini_. He afterwards[275] described some specimens which showed\r\nthat the features characteristic of _Knorria_ may occur on partially\r\ndecorticated stems with leaf-cushions of the true Lepidodendron type.\r\nHis specimens, preserved in the Breslau Museum, demonstrate the\r\naccuracy of his drawings and conclusions. Goeppert, and after him\r\nBalfour[276], drew attention to the different appearances presented\r\nby branches of _Araucaria imbricata_ when preserved with the surface\r\nintact and after partial decortication, as illustrating possible\r\nsources of error in the determination of fossil stems.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is now a well-established fact that fossils bearing the\r\nname _Knorria_ are imperfect lepidodendroid stems, the use of the term\r\nmay be conveniently retained for descriptive purposes. The specimen\r\nfrom the Commentry coal-field of France, shown in fig. 156, affords\r\nsome excuse for the institution of several generic names for different\r\nstates of preservation or decortication of one species. The cortical\r\nlevel exposed at _e_ is characterised by spirally disposed peg-like\r\nridges with truncated apices: it is this form of cast which is usually\r\ndesignated _Knorria_. The ridges vary in size and shape in different\r\ntypes of stem; they may be narrow as shown at _e_, fig. 156, or short\r\nand broad with rounded distal ends. In some cases they are forked at\r\nthe apex, as in the partially decorticated specimen of _Lepidodendron\r\nVeltheimianum_ represented in fig. 185, A.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 156. A dichotomously branched Lepidodendroid stem\r\n  (_Knorria mirabilis_ Ren. and Zeill.). (After Renault and Zeiller.)\r\n  (¼ nat. size.) The original specimen is in the Natural History\r\n  Museum, Paris.\r\n\r\n  _a–g_, surface features exposed as the result of different degrees\r\n  of decortication. (See vol. I. p. 102, fig. 23).]\r\n\r\nThe _Knorria_ state represents the impression or cast of the outer\r\ncortical region too deep below the leaf-cushion region to retain\r\nany indications of the cushion-form; the ridges are the casts of the\r\nspaces produced in the cortex by the decay of the sheath of delicate\r\ncells surrounding each leaf-trace and by the decay of the thin-walled\r\ncells of the parichnos. The occasional forked apex of a ridge is the\r\nexpression of the fact that the cast was made at the region where the\r\nparichnos divides into two arms (cf. p. 100). In certain specimens it\r\nis possible to connect the Knorria casts with associated lepidodendroid\r\nstems which may be determined specifically; but when we have no\r\nevidence as to surface-features the fossils may be designated casts\r\nof lepidodendroid stems in the Knorria condition. Such casts are\r\nillustrated by numerous drawings in palaeobotanical literature[277].\r\n\r\n\r\n_b._ _Bergeria._\r\n\r\nThis is another name first used by Sternberg in his classic work,\r\n_Die Flora der Vorwelt_, for casts of lepidodendroid plants such as\r\nSteinhauer[278] had previously figured as _Phytolithus cancellatus_.\r\nBrongniart[279] recognised that the application of the generic title\r\n_Lepidodendron_ should be extended to include specimens referred by\r\nSternberg to _Bergeria_, and a few years later Goldenberg[280] realised\r\nthat this name does not stand for well-defined generic characters.\r\nThe correctness of these views was, however, first satisfactorily\r\ndemonstrated by Carruthers[281] and by Feistmantel[282].\r\n\r\nIf a Lepidodendron stem loses its superficial layers of outer\r\ncortex and in this condition is embedded in sand or mud, the cast\r\nis distinguished from that of a perfect stem by the absence of\r\nthe leaf-scars and by other features. It may, however, still show\r\nspirally disposed areas, corresponding approximately to the original\r\nleaf-cushions, which are characterised by a small depression or pit\r\neither at the apex or near the centre of each oval area: the pit marks\r\nthe position of the leaf-trace and its parichnos strand. In some\r\ncases the exposed surface may be smooth without any indication of\r\nleaf-cushions, while narrow spirally arranged grooves represent the\r\nobliquely ascending vascular bundles passing through the cortex to the\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nFig. 185, B, shows the Bergeria state of _Lepidodendron Veltheimianum_,\r\nwhich differs from the Knorria condition in the fact that decortication\r\nhad not extended below the level at which the form of the leaf-cushions\r\ncould be recognised. It is clear that no sharp line can be drawn in all\r\ncases between the different degrees of decortication as expressed by\r\nthe terms _Knorria_ and _Bergeria_.\r\n\r\nA list of synonyms of _Knorria_, _Bergeria_, and _Aspidiaria_ forms of\r\nstem and a detailed treatment of their characteristic features may be\r\nfound in a recent work by Potonié[283].\r\n\r\n\r\n_c._ _Aspidiaria._\r\n\r\nIn one of the earliest English books on fossil plants, the\r\n_Antediluvian Phytology_ by Artis[284], a specimen from the\r\nCarboniferous sandstone of Yorkshire is figured as _Aphyllum\r\ncristatum_, and a similar fossil is described as _A. asperum_. These\r\nare impressions of Lepidodendron stems in which the characteristic\r\nleaf-cushions are replaced by smooth and slightly convex areas with\r\na narrow central ridge. To this type of specimen Presl gave the\r\nname _Aspidiaria_[285], under the impression, shared by subsequent\r\nwriters, that the supposed external features were entitled to generic\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\nIt is to Stur[286] that we owe the first satisfactory interpretation\r\nof fossils included under the name _Aspidiaria_: he showed that on the\r\nremoval of the projecting convex areas from some of his specimens a\r\ntypical Lepidodendron leaf-cushion was exposed (fig. 144, A, _a_). The\r\nAspidiaria condition (fig. 144, A, _b_) represents the inner face of\r\nthe detached shell of outer bark of a Lepidodendron stem, while in the\r\nBergeria casts we have a view of the external face of a stem deprived\r\nof its superficial tissues.\r\n\r\nIn a Lepidodendron stem embedded in sediment the more delicate portions\r\nof the leaf-cushions would tend to shrink away from the internal and\r\nmore resistant tissues of the outer cortex, thus producing spaces\r\nbetween each cushion; further decay would cause rupture of the\r\nleaf-traces and the superficial tissues would thus be separated from\r\nthe rest of the stem. The tendency of Lepidodendron stems to split\r\nalong the line of phellogen in the outer cortex is seen in fig. 148,\r\nA, _g_. The deposition of sediment on the exposed inner face of this\r\ncortical shell would result in the production of a specimen of the\r\nAspidiaria type: the reticulum enclosing the spirally disposed convex\r\nareas is formed by the impression of the firmer tissue between the\r\nleaf-cushions.\r\n\r\n\r\n     vi. _Lepidodendroid axes known as_ Ulodendron _and_ Halonia.\r\n\r\n_a_. _Ulodendron._\r\n\r\nThis generic name was suggested by Lindley and Hutton[287] for two\r\nspecimens from the English Coal-measures characterised by leaf-cushions\r\nlike those of a _Lepidodendron_, but distinguished by the presence of\r\ntwo vertical rows of large and more or less circular cup-shaped scars.\r\nThese authors, while recognising the possibility that the fossils\r\nmight be identical with _Lepidodendron_, regarded them as generically\r\ndistinct. The generic title _Ulodendron_, though no longer denoting\r\ngeneric rank, is still applied to certain shoots of lycopodiaceous\r\nplants which may belong to the genera _Lepidodendron_, _Bothrodendron_,\r\nand according to some authors[288], also to _Sigillaria_.\r\n\r\nThe large specimen from the Belgian coal-measures, represented in fig.\r\n211, affords a good example of the Ulodendron form of shoot of the\r\ngenus _Bothrodendron_, which is described on page 249. The specimen\r\nshown in fig. 157 shows the _Ulodendron_ shoot of _Lepidodendron\r\nVeltheimianum_.\r\n\r\nCasts of large Ulodendron scars are occasionally met with as separate\r\nfossils bearing a resemblance to an oval shell.\r\n\r\nIn Steinhauer’s paper on _Fossil Reliquiae_[289] a drawing is given of\r\na Ulodendron stem under the name _Phytolithus parmatus_ and a similar\r\nstem specifically identical with that shown in fig. 157 was figured by\r\nRhode[290], one of the earliest writers on fossil plants, under the\r\ncomprehensive designation “Schuppenpflanze.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 157. _Lepidodendron Veltheimianum._ Ulodendron\r\n  condition. (From a photograph by Dr Kidston of a specimen from the\r\n  Calciferous Sandstone series, Midlothian; ⅖ nat. size.) [Kidston\r\n  (02) Pl. LVII.]\r\n\r\nThere has been no lack of ingenuity on the part of authors in offering\r\nsuggestions as to the meaning of these large cup-like depressions,\r\nand there is still difference of opinion as to their significance.\r\nLindley and Hutton[291] described them as the scars of branches or\r\nmasses of inflorescence. Sir Joseph Hooker[292] speaks of a specimen\r\nof _Ulodendron_, shown to him by Mr Dawes, on which a large organ,\r\nsupposed to be a cone, was inserted in one of the depressions, but\r\nhe was unable to arrive at any conclusion as to the real nature of\r\nthe fossil. While most authors have seen in the scars pressure-areas\r\nformed by the pressure of sessile cones against the surface of a\r\ngrowing branch, others, as for example Geinitz[293], have described\r\nthe depressions as branch-scars. Carruthers[294] regarded the scars\r\nas those of adventitious roots and Williamson referred to them as the\r\nscars of reproductive shoots. The depressions vary considerably in\r\nsize. The Belgian example shown in fig. 211 possesses scars 9 cm. in\r\ndiameter. A specimen of _Bothrodendron_ in the Manchester Museum from\r\nthe Lancashire Coal-Measures, to which Williamson[295] has referred,\r\nbears two rows of scars 11–12 cm. in diameter on a stem 112 cm. in\r\ngirth and 233 cm. long. The scars occur in two alternate series, on\r\nopposite faces of the axis, the distance between the successive scars\r\nin the same row being 29 cm. The surface-features of this large stem\r\nare not preserved.\r\n\r\nBefore considering the nature and origin of the scars it is important\r\nto remember the considerable size to which they may attain; other\r\npoints of importance are the occurrence, either in the centre of each\r\ndepression or in an excentric position, of an umbilicus or slightly\r\nprojecting boss, in the centre of which is a pit formed by the decay of\r\nan outgoing vascular strand. The sloping sides of the scars sometimes\r\nbear elevations resembling leaf-cushions like those on the rest of\r\nthe stem surface. In the specimen shown in fig. 157 the lower margin\r\nof each cup shows indistinctly the outlines of what appear to be\r\nleaf-cushions, while the rest of the sloping face is characterised by\r\nradial ridges, which may be due to bracts or leaves.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that in these cups we have the scars of some lateral\r\norgan, but the evidence afforded by specimens of which the depressions\r\ncontain the remains of such organs is by no means conclusive. A\r\nUlodendron has been figured by D’Arcy Thompson[296], in which the lower\r\npart of a lateral organ is attached by a narrow base to one of the\r\nscars, but the preservation is not sufficiently good to enable us to\r\ndecide whether the organ is a cone or a vegetative shoot. Kidston[297]\r\nhas described other examples showing portions of organs in connexion\r\nwith the scars, but an examination of the specimens in his collection\r\nfailed to convince me that his interpretation of them as strobili is\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon known as cladoptosis, as shown on a stem of the Conifer\r\n_Agathis_[298] and certain Dicotyledonous trees such as _Castilloa_,\r\nsuggests a possible explanation of the Ulodendron scars. This\r\ncomparison was made by Shattock[299] in 1888, but he did not accept the\r\nresemblance as a real one. An objection may be urged to the cladoptosis\r\nhypothesis that in _Ulodendron_ the branch, whether vegetative or\r\nreproductive, was not attached to the whole of the depressed area.\r\nOn the other hand, a lateral branch originally attached by a narrow\r\nbase may have continued to increase in diameter until its base became\r\nslightly sunk in the bark of the stem, thus producing a cup-like\r\ndepression which, on the fall of the branch, would retain traces of the\r\noriginal surface-features of the stem.\r\n\r\nMr Watson[300] of Manchester recently published a paper on Ulodendron\r\nscars, in which he adduces fresh and, as it seems to me, satisfactory\r\narguments in favour of the branch-scar hypothesis. Fig. 158, from\r\none of Mr Watson’s blocks, illustrates the nature of his evidence.\r\nHe points out that in the obverse half of a large specimen of\r\n_Bothrodendron_ in the Manchester Museum, the umbilicus consists of a\r\ncylindrical hole, 18 mm. deep and 8 mm. in diameter, surrounded by a\r\nprojecting ring of mineral material which doubtless represents some\r\nportion of the original plant: on the reverse half of the specimen\r\nthe continuation of the ring is seen as a prominent cone fitting into\r\nthe cup-like depression in the obverse half: the conical cast shows\r\nthat numerous small vascular strands were given off from this ring of\r\ntissue, and these strands have the same arrangement and size as the\r\ndots which are found on typical Ulodendron scars. He interprets the\r\nring surrounding the umbilicus as the remains of the primary wood and\r\nthe small strands as leaf-traces supplying the branch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 158. Diagrammatic section through the base of a\r\n  branch to illustrate the Branch theory of the Ulodendroid scar.\r\n  (After Watson.)]\r\n\r\nIn the diagrammatic section shown in fig. 158 the outer cortex of the\r\nmain stem is represented by _oc_ 1; this consists of secondary tissue.\r\nThe corresponding tissue in the branch is seen at _oc_ 2.

If we assume the branch\r\nto be detached along the line LS, the depression would show numerous\r\nspirally arranged dots representing the points of exit of leaf-traces\r\nand the vascular axis would be exposed in the umbilicus. This\r\nexplanation appears to me to be in harmony with the surface-features\r\nof Ulodendron scars on both Bothrodendron and Lepidodendron stems. The\r\noccasional occurrence of leaf-cushions on a portion of a Ulodendron\r\nscar is a difficulty on the cladoptosis hypothesis. Assuming that true\r\nleaf-cushions occur, their presence may, as Watson suggests, be due to\r\nthe folding back of a piece of the outer cortex of the branch which has\r\nbeen “crushed down on to the area of the scar[301].”\r\n\r\nSince this account was written a note has been published by M.\r\nRenier[302] in which he describes a specimen of _Bothrodendron_ from\r\nLiège, one face of which shows a projecting Ulodendroid scar with an\r\nexcentric umbilicus. On the other face is a dichotomously branched\r\nshoot with surface-features corresponding to those on the scar; the\r\nevidence that the scar represents the base of the branch is described\r\nas indisputable.\r\n\r\nStur[303] held the view that the depressions on Ulodendron stems\r\nrepresent the places of attachment of special shoots comparable with\r\nthe bulbils of _Lycopodium Selago_, or, it may be added, with the short\r\nbranches occasionally produced on _Cycas_ stems. If the depressions\r\nwere formed by the pressure of the bases of cones, it is clear that\r\nthe size of the cavity must be an index of the diameter of the cone.\r\nThe larger Ulodendron scars exceed in diameter the base of any known\r\nlepidodendroid strobilus. Another obvious difficulty, which has not\r\nbeen overlooked by Kidston who holds that the scars were produced\r\nby sessile cones, is that in _Lepidodendron Veltheimianum_ strobili\r\nwere borne at the tips of slender branches; the same difficulty is\r\npresented by _Bothrodendron_ (Fig. 213). It is unlikely that two types\r\nof strobili were produced on the same plant, particularly as the cone\r\nof _L. Veltheimianum_ was heterosporous.\r\n\r\nThe cones of certain species of _Pinus_ remain attached to the tree\r\nfor many years and their bases become embedded in the stem; this is\r\nparticularly well shown in the drawing of a cone of _Pinus clausa_\r\n(fig. 159), for which I am indebted to Mr Sudworth, Dendrologist in\r\nthe United States Forest Service. Mr Sudworth has drawn my attention\r\nto _P. attenuata_ and _P. muricata_ in illustration of the same\r\nphenomenon[304]. The example shown in fig. 159 cannot, however, be\r\nmatched by any known specimen of _Ulodendron_; in the case of the\r\ndepressions on the stem of a Pine the cone-base fits the circular scar,\r\nbut in the fossil stems it is practically certain that this was not the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 159. _Pinus clausa._ ½ nat. size.]\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that certain Palaeozoic Lycopods shed their\r\nbranches by a method similar to that employed by the Kauri Pine of New\r\nZealand and by some species of Dicotyledons. The evidence adduced in\r\nthe case of _Bothrodendron punctatum_ is a strong argument in favour of\r\nextending the same explanation to other Ulodendron shoots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 160.\r\n\r\n  A. _Lepidophloios scoticus_ Kidst.

The original\r\nspecimens referred to this genus are decorticated axes showing remains\r\nof Lepidodendroid leaf-cushions. The spirally disposed circular scars\r\nin the specimen of _Halonia_ (_Lepidophloios scoticus_[306]) shown in\r\nfig. 160 constitute the characteristic feature of the genus; they may\r\nhave the form, as in fig. 160, A, of circular discs with a central\r\numbilicus marking the position of a vascular strand, or, as in the\r\nsandstone cast of _Halonia tortuosa_ shown in fig. 161[307], they may\r\nappear as prominent tubercles. The latter example illustrates the\r\ncondition characteristic of partially decorticated stems.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 161. _Halonia tortuosa_ L. and H. From a specimen\r\n  in Dr Kidston’s Collection, from the Lower Coal-measures of\r\n  Ayrshire (No. 1561); ⅔ nat. size.]\r\n\r\nIn 1883 Williamson[308] described a specimen, now in the Leeds\r\nMuseum, which convinced him that _Halonia_ is merely a special form\r\nof _Lepidodendron_ concerned with the production of fertile shoots or\r\nstrobili. Feistmantel[309] also recognised that _Halonia_ _regularis_\r\nis identical in the form of the cushions with the type known as\r\n_Lepidophloios laricinus_. It is worthy of note that under the name\r\n_Halonia_, Feistmantel[310] figured a piece of decorticated axis\r\ncharacterised by two rows instead of the usual spiral series of large\r\ncup-shaped scars. Recent researches have, however, tended to break down\r\nthe distinction between _Ulodendron_ and _Halonia_ founded respectively\r\non the biseriate and spiral arrangement of the scars or tubercles.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of Halonial branches as cone-bearing members of\r\nLepidodendroid plants has passed into a generally accepted statement\r\nof fact, but, so far as I know, only one specimen has been figured in\r\nwhich strobili are seen attached to an Halonia axis. This specimen,\r\ndescribed by Grand’Eury[311] from the coal-field of Gard, is hardly\r\nsufficiently well-preserved to constitute a demonstration of the\r\ncorrectness of the generally received view, which, as is not unusual,\r\nhas been repeated by one writer after another without due regard being\r\npaid to the nature of the evidence on which the statement is based. It\r\nmay, indeed, be correct to describe Halonial branches as cone-bearing,\r\nbut there are certain considerations which make one pause before\r\nunhesitatingly accepting this explanation. The vascular strand which\r\npasses from the central cylinder of the shoot to the tubercle or scar\r\nis composed of a solid rod of xylem distinguished from the main stele\r\nby the absence of a pith. In such petrified peduncles as have been\r\ndiscovered the stele is of the medullated type. The common occurrence\r\nof strobili terminating slender branches of lepidodendroid plants,\r\nthough not a fatal objection to their attachment to Halonial shoots,\r\nshows that in many cases the cones were borne at the tip of leafy\r\nshoots. It may be that some of the Halonial scars are in origin like\r\nthose of the Ulodendron axes of _Bothrodendron_ and mark the position\r\nof deciduous vegetative branches.\r\n\r\nThe first account of the anatomy of _Halonia_ we owe to Dawes[312];\r\nthis was followed by a fuller description by Binney[313]. The\r\nhistory of our knowledge of this type of branch has been given\r\nby Carruthers[314], who expressed the opinion that Halonia is\r\nmerely a fertile condition of _Lepidophloios_ and possibly of other\r\nlepidodendroid plants. He was also inclined to regard the Halonial\r\ntubercles as younger stages of the larger scars characteristic of the\r\ngenus _Ulodendron_. Williamson’s contributions to our knowledge of\r\n_Halonia_ are of primary importance; he supplied further proof of the\r\nLepidodendroid nature of these branches and advanced our knowledge of\r\ntheir anatomy. In an early paper[315] he expressed the view that the\r\ndifferences on which _Halonia_ and _Ulodendron_ are separated are such\r\nas result from a difference in age and are not of generic importance.\r\nIn the last memoir, of which he was sole author, published by the Royal\r\nSociety[316], Williamson brought forward further evidence in support of\r\nthis well-founded opinion.\r\n\r\nThat the fossils known as _Halonia_ are branches of a lepidodendroid\r\nplant is at least certain, and it is probable that the lateral\r\nbranches which they bore were fertile, though satisfactory proof of\r\nthis is lacking. We know also that Halonia branches are characterised\r\nby the Lepidophloios form of leaf-cushion; there is, however, no\r\nsufficient reason to assume that such branches were never attached\r\nto stems with the cushions of the Lepidodendron form. The further\r\nquestion, namely whether Williamson was correct in his contention as\r\nto the absence of any essential distinction between _Ulodendron_ and\r\n_Halonia_, does not admit of an unchallenged answer. In 1903 Weiss[317]\r\ndescribed the anatomy of a specimen of a biseriate _Halonia_ branch of\r\n_Lepidophloios_. The form of the leaf-cushions is unfortunately not\r\nvery well preserved, but Weiss figures other specimens with two rows\r\nof tubercles on which the leaf-cushions are sufficiently distinct to\r\njustify a comparison with those of _Lepidophloios_. He believes with\r\nWilliamson that it is the presence of tubercles in place of scars which\r\ndistinguishes _Halonia_ from _Ulodendron_, and that the arrangement of\r\nthe tubercles or scars is a matter of little importance. He expresses\r\nthe opinion justified by the evidence available that the absence or\r\npresence of tubercles is merely due to accidents of preservation or,\r\none may add, to difference in age. Kidston[318] dissents from Weiss’s\r\ndescription of his specimen as a biseriate _Halonia_; he regards it as\r\na Ulodendron branch of _Sigillaria discophora_ (König). Until specimens\r\nwith more clearly preserved external features are forthcoming it is\r\nimpossible to settle the point in dispute, but on the facts before\r\nus there would seem to be a _prima facie_ case in favour of Weiss’s\r\ncontention.\r\n\r\nThe designation _Halonia_ may be retained as a descriptive term for\r\nLepidodendroid shoots characterised by spirally disposed scars or\r\ntubercles and bearing leaf-cushions of the Lepidophloios type. In the\r\ncase of specimens showing prominent tubercles, the superficial tissues\r\nare usually absent and, as in the fossil represented in fig. 161, the\r\nname _Halonia_ does not necessarily imply the presence of leaf-cushions\r\nof a particular type.\r\n\r\n\r\n    vii. _Anatomical characters of Vegetative Lepidodendron shoots_\r\n                 (_Lepidodendron and Lepidophloios_).\r\n\r\nThe type already described under the name _Lepidodendron vasculare_\r\ndiffers from those dealt with in the following pages chiefly in the\r\nanatomy of the stele. The simplest and probably most primitive type of\r\nLepidodendron stem is that in which the xylem forms a solid rod; the\r\ntype of stele most frequently represented is that of _L. Harcourtii_,\r\n_L. fuliginosum_, and other species in which the diameter of the stele\r\nis greater and a cylinder of primary xylem encloses a comparatively\r\nlarge parenchymatous pith.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Lepidodendron esnostense_, Renault[319].\r\n\r\nThis species was founded by Renault on petrified specimens from the\r\nCulm beds of Esnost in France. The surface of a young twig bears\r\nprominent leaf-cushions of elongated rhomboidal form similar to those\r\nof _Lepidodendron obovatum_ (fig. 173) and other species. In older\r\nbranches the primary cortex is replaced by a considerable thickness\r\nof radially disposed secondary cortical tissue which, as shown in\r\ntangential section, consists of a reticulum of elongated pointed\r\nelements with comparatively thick walls enclosing meshes filled with\r\nlarge-celled parenchyma. It is worthy of note that if such a branch\r\nwere exposed to decay, the earlier destruction of the more delicate\r\ntissue in the meshes of the secondary cortex would produce a series of\r\noval depressions, corresponding to the parenchymatous areas, separated\r\nby a projecting reticulum of the more resistant elements: a cast of\r\nthis partially decayed surface would be indistinguishable from that\r\nof some types of _Sigillaria_ or of a _Lyginodendron_. The inner\r\nregions of the cortex of the type-specimens have not been preserved.\r\nThe xylem, which is the only part of the stele represented, has the\r\nform of a protostele or solid cylinder of scalariform tracheids with\r\nperipheral groups of narrower protoxylem elements which mark the\r\npoints of exit of the leaf-traces: in a branch 1–2 cm. wide the xylem\r\ncolumn has a diameter of 3 mm. The small leaves (fig. 143, B, C),\r\nsimilar to those of a _Sigillaria_, are sub-rhomboidal in section\r\nnear the base and approximately circular near the apex[320]. The\r\nmesophyll consists of palisade cells having the appearance of typical\r\nchlorophyll-tissue. The heterosporous strobili attributed to this\r\nspecies bore microsporangia on the upper and megasporangia on the lower\r\nsporophylls; the megaspores, of which a considerable number occur in\r\neach megasporangium, are identical in size with those of another Culm\r\nform, _Lepidodendron rhodumnense_. Some of these have retained traces\r\nof prothallus tissue, and in one spore Renault figures what he regards\r\nas an archegonium: the drawing is by no means convincing.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Lepidodendron rhodumnense_, Renault[321].\r\n\r\nThe species from the Culm of Combres (Loire) agrees in its solid xylem\r\ncylinder and in the differentiation of the secondary cortex, as also in\r\nthe association of two kinds of spore, with _Lepidodendron esnostense_.\r\nA comparison of the leaves of the two types reveals certain differences\r\nwhich may be of specific rank, but, apart from minor differences, these\r\nCulm species may be classed under one anatomical type.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Lepidodendron saalfeldense_, Solms-Laubach[322].\r\n\r\nThis Devonian species was founded on a specimen 3 × 2·5 cm. broad\r\nat the base, which shows the stumps of four branches recalling the\r\ndichotomously branched arms of _Stigmaria_ and _Pleuromeia_. If these\r\nare in reality the remains of Stigmaria-like horizontal branches the\r\nspecies affords an interesting example of a Lepidodendron axis with\r\na subterranean rhizome of the type which has been found in several\r\nSigillarian stems. In the upper end of the axis the stele consists of a\r\nsolid strand of xylem which is not sufficiently well preserved to show\r\nthe position of the protoxylem groups. A transverse section taken near\r\nthe base reveals a type of stele differing from that at the upper end\r\nin being composed of radially disposed tracheids and in its resemblance\r\nto the stele of _Stigmaria_.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Lepidodendron fuliginosum_, Williamson.

Soc.\r\n        Edinburgh, Vol. XXXVIII. p. 548.\r\n\r\nThe name _Lepidodendron fuliginosum_ was proposed by Williamson in\r\n1887 for petrified stems previously included by him in Witham’s\r\nspecies _L. Harcourtii_, but subsequently recognised as a distinct\r\ntype characterised by “the greater uniformity in the composition\r\nof the entire cortex” and by other features some of which do not\r\nconstitute distinctive characters. The species agrees with _L.\r\nHarcourtii_ and with _L. Veltheimianum_ in having a medullated stele;\r\nit is distinguished not only by the more frequent preservation of\r\nthe middle cortex, a fact due to a difference in minute structure,\r\nbut chiefly by the peculiar structure of the secondary tissue\r\nadded to the stele; this is in part composed of radial series of\r\nparenchymatous cells and of a varying amount of tracheal tissue\r\nthe elements of which are narrower than in other species and are\r\ncharacterised also by their sinuous vertical course. As is pointed\r\nout in the sequel, the anatomical features of _L. fuliginosum_, as at\r\npresent understood, are not confined to one type of _Lepidodendron_\r\nstem. Specimens have been described with leaf-cushions of the form\r\ncharacteristic of _L. aculeatum_, _L. obovatum_ and _Lepidophloios_\r\ncombined with the anatomical features of Williamson’s species: it is\r\npossible that the two species _L. obovatum_ and _L. aculeatum_ are\r\nnot really distinct[323], but it is certain that shoots with both the\r\n_Lepidodendron_ and _Lepidophloios_ cushions may have the same type of\r\nanatomical structure.\r\n\r\nA more detailed knowledge of the structural features of Lepidodendron\r\nshoots may enable us to define anatomical species with more exactness\r\nthan is possible at present. There can, however, be little doubt that\r\nwell-marked anatomical features may be associated with more than one\r\nspecific form of shoot as defined by the form of the leaf-cushions.\r\n\r\nSolms-Laubach proposed the name _Lepidodendron Williamsoni_ for the\r\nanatomical type _L. fuliginosum_ of Williamson, but the latter name has\r\nbeen generally adopted.\r\n\r\nIn the following account special attention is directed to the nature\r\nand origin of the secondary stelar tissue and to the secretory\r\nzone, as difference of opinion exists as to the interpretation of\r\nthese features. Among the best examples of shoots of _Lepidodendron\r\nfuliginosum_ without secondary tissue or in which it is feebly\r\ndeveloped are those originally described by Binney. The stele includes\r\na large parenchymatous pith, the cells of which frequently show signs\r\nof recent division, a feature observed also in the pith of the large\r\nstem of _L. Wünschianum_, represented in figs. 181, 182. The primary\r\nxylem cylinder has an irregularly crenulate outer edge like that of _L.\r\nWünschianum_ and _L. Harcourtii_ and the protoxylem elements occupy an\r\nexarch position. Isodiametric reticulately-pitted elements are met with\r\nboth on the inner and outer edge of the xylem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 162. _Lepidodendron fuliginosum._ Part of the\r\n  stele in transverse section. (Binney Collection, Sedgwick Museum,\r\n  Cambridge.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 163. _Lepidodendron fuliginosum._ Longitudinal\r\n  section. (Binney Collection, Cambridge.)]\r\n\r\nFigs. 162 and 163 illustrate the structure of the outer portion of the\r\nxylem and adjacent tissues in a section of a shoot 3·8 cm. × 2·5 cm. in\r\ndiameter, which is in the act of branching, as shown by the occurrence\r\nof two steles of equal size. A figure of the complete section will\r\nbe found in Binney’s memoir[324], and additional illustrations were\r\npublished in 1899[325].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 164. _Lepidodendron fuliginosum_. Leaf-trace.\r\n  (Binney Collection, Cambridge.)]\r\n\r\nThe primary xylem (figs. 162, 163, _x_) is succeeded by 2–3 rows of\r\npolygonal cells with dark contents and associated with isodiametric\r\ntracheae: these pass into clearer parenchymatous tissue, _a_,\r\ncharacterised by the arrangement of the cells in vertical series,\r\nto which the term meristematic zone has been applied. The secretory\r\nzone, _s_, abutting on the meristematic zone, consists of more or less\r\ndisorganised parenchymatous cells and broader and more elongated\r\nspaces; it is interrupted here and there by an outgoing leaf-trace,\r\nas at _lt_ 1 and _lt_ 2 in fig. 162. The secretory zone is succeeded\r\nby a homogeneous inner cortex like that described in _L. vasculare_;\r\npart of this region is seen at the upper edge of fig. 162. The broad\r\nmiddle cortex, which is separated from the inner cortex by a sharply\r\ndefined boundary, is composed of rather small lacunar parenchymatous\r\ntissue consisting of sinuous tubular elements interspersed among\r\nisodiametric cells of various sizes (fig. 166, _p_). In the middle\r\ncortical region the leaf-traces pursue an almost horizontal course; one\r\nis shown in fig. 164, in oblique longitudinal section, in a reversed\r\nposition; the xylem, _x_, should be on the inner side of the secretory\r\ntissue, _s_. The clear space between the two parts of the vascular\r\nbundle was originally occupied by a few layers of parenchymatous\r\ncells, as seen in the transverse sections, figs. 165 and 166. In some\r\nspecimens the leaf-traces pass through the middle cortex in a much\r\nmore vertical course, as shown by the section represented in fig. 165.\r\nThis section illustrates the structure of a typical leaf-trace with\r\nunusual clearness; it shows the tangentially elongated group of xylem,\r\nthe strand of tissue which occupies the position of phloem, _s_ (to\r\nwhich the term secretory zone is applied), the compact parenchyma\r\nbetween the two parts of the bundle, and surrounding the whole a\r\nnarrow sheath sharply contrasted by the smaller and more uniform size\r\nof the cells from the middle cortex, a few cells of which are seen in\r\nthe photograph. The middle cortex shows a well-defined junction with\r\nthe more compact outer cortical region, which consists of primary\r\nparenchyma passing externally into a zone of phelloderm composed of\r\nthick-walled and more elongated cells. A noticeable feature in many\r\nLepidodendron shoots is the occurrence of a circle of strands of\r\nsecretory cells often surrounding fairly large ducts just internal to\r\nthe edge of phelloderm: similar strands form irregularly concentric\r\ncircles, as was pointed out in the case of _L. vasculare_, in the\r\nphelloderm itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 165. _Lepidodendron fuliginosum._ Leaf-trace: _x_,\r\n  xylem; _s_, secretory zone. (Binney Collection, Cambridge.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 166. _Lepidodendron fuliginosum._ Leaf-trace: _p_,\r\n  parichnos. (Binney Collection, Cambridge.)]\r\n\r\nFig. 166 shows a leaf-trace in the outer cortex accompanied by its\r\ncrescent-shaped parichnos, _p_, derived from the middle cortex and\r\nby means of which the outer cortex and the lamina of the leaves are\r\nconnected with the inner region of the shoot. This lacunar middle\r\ncortex and parichnos doubtless constitute an aerating tissue-system\r\nwhich after leaf-fall is exposed directly to the air at the ends of the\r\nparichnos arms on the leaf-scars.\r\n\r\nSome of the sections in the Binney Collection (Sedgwick Museum,\r\nCambridge) show early stages in the production of secondary xylem: in\r\nthe section represented in fig. 167 the secretory zone is succeeded\r\non its inner face by a zone of radially elongated cells, _m_, which\r\nare clearly in a meristematic condition. The same section shows also\r\nthe more radially extended form of the xylem of a leaf-trace with its\r\ninternal protoxylem, _px_, in contrast to the tangentially elongated\r\nform which is assumed during its passage through the cortex (cf. figs.\r\n165, 166).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 167. _Lepidodendron fuliginosum._ (Binney\r\n  Collection, Cambridge.)]\r\n\r\nSome sections of _Lepidodendron fuliginosum_ in the Manchester\r\nUniversity Collection are of special interest from the point of view of\r\nthe method of secondary thickening. In the section reproduced in fig.\r\n168, B, the meristematic zone is seen to consist in part of radially\r\nelongated elements, _m_, with parallel cross-walls evidently of recent\r\norigin. The same tissue is shown also in fig. 168, C, _a_, D, _a_,\r\nand in fig. 169, A, _a_ This band of meristem, which we may speak of\r\nas the cambium, occurs in the outer region of the meristematic zone\r\nimmediately internal to the secretory zone, _sc_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 168.\r\n\r\n  A. _Lepidodendron vasculare._ (Botany School, Cambridge.)\r\n  B. _Lepidodendron fuliginosum._ (From a specimen from Shore,\r\n     Lancashire, in the Cambridge Botany School Collection).\r\n  C. _L. fuliginosum._ (“Biseriate Halonia” of Weiss No. 257,\r\n     Manchester University Museum.)\r\n  D. _L. fuliginosum._ (Manchester Univ. Museum.)]\r\n\r\nThe result of the activity of this cambium band is the production of\r\nsecondary parenchyma and tracheal tissue. In fig. 179, E, drawn from\r\na portion of the section represented in fig. 168, B, a projecting arm\r\nof primary xylem is seen at _x_; this is followed by 2–3 layers of\r\nparenchymatous cells, some of which have dark contents, and beyond\r\nthis is seen a group of secondary elements, _tr_, cut across somewhat\r\nobliquely, which are evidently products of the cambial cells on the\r\ninner margin of the secretory zone, _sc_. The longitudinal section\r\n(fig. 169, D) shows the cambial cells, a, next the secretory zone,\r\n_sc_, passing internally into crushed and imperfectly preserved\r\nelongated elements which are presumably miniature tracheae, and these\r\nare succeeded by older and more completely lignified xylem elements,\r\n_x_. In larger shoots the amount of secondary tissue is considerably\r\ngreater; it may consist almost entirely of short-celled parenchyma\r\n(fig. 168, C, from _x_ to _sc_), or it may include a large proportion\r\nof radially disposed and vertically elongated tracheae (fig. 168,\r\nD, _x_², and fig. 170, A, _x_²), or it may consist of parenchyma\r\ncontaining scattered groups of tracheae (fig. 169, A, _x_²)[326].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 169. _Lepidodendron fuliginosum._\r\n\r\n  A, B.

No. 6.)]\r\n\r\nFig. 169, A, is a diagrammatic sketch of the tissues—1 mm. wide—between\r\nthe primary xylem, _x_, and the inner cortex. The primary xylem is\r\nsucceeded by short parenchymatous cells followed by a zone of radially\r\nelongated elements passing occasionally into rows of narrow scalariform\r\ntracheae, some of which, owing to their sinuous longitudinal course\r\n(fig. 171, C), are seen in oblique section, as at C, fig. 169, A. At\r\nits outer edge this secondary tissue, _x_², consisting of parenchyma\r\nand tracheae, passes into the cambial band (fig. 169, B, _a_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 170. _Lepidodendron fuliginosum._ (From sections in\r\n  the Manchester Museum.)]\r\n\r\nThe radial longitudinal section represented in fig. 168, C, is\r\ntaken from the fossil described by Weiss as a biseriate _Halonia_;\r\nit agrees sufficiently closely in structure with others referred\r\nto _Lepidodendron fuliginosum_ to be classed as an example of this\r\nanatomical type. A complete transverse section of the stem measures 9\r\n× 6·3 cm.; the breadth of the tissues between the edge of the primary\r\nxylem and the outer edge of the secretory zone is 2·5 mm. The middle\r\ncortical region, characterised by the sooty appearance, which led\r\nWilliamson to choose the specific name _fuliginosum_, is traversed\r\nby the leaf-traces and is sharply differentiated from both the inner\r\nand outer cortex. The longitudinal section (fig. 168, C) shows the\r\nouter edge of the primary xylem, _x_, abutting on a band of dark and\r\nsmall-celled parenchyma which passes into the broad zone of secondary\r\ntissue, _m_, the inner region of which consists of fairly thick-walled\r\nelements in radial series passing externally into the thin-walled cells\r\nof the cambial region, _a_, on the inner edge of the secretory zone,\r\n_sc_. This section shows also the interruption of the secretory zone\r\nby an outgoing leaf-trace, _lt_, the lower part of which, _sc_, is\r\ncontinued downwards into the secretory zone. The exit of a leaf-trace\r\nproduces a gap in the secretory zone of the stem, but not in the xylem.\r\nIf we applied the term phloem to the secretory zone—a course adopted by\r\nProf. F. E. Weiss and some other authors, but which I do not propose\r\nto follow—we should speak of a phloem foliar-gap as a characteristic\r\nfeature of a Lepidodendron shoot. This applies to other species of the\r\ngenus as well as to _L. fuliginosum_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 171. _Lepidodendron fuliginosum._ (From sections in\r\n  the Manchester Museum.)]\r\n\r\nFig. 171, A, shows more clearly the broad zone of secondary parenchyma\r\nwith the thinner-walled cambial region, _a_; the latter is represented\r\non a larger scale in fig. 171, B. The section shown in fig. 168,\r\nD, and in fig. 170, A, affords an example of a stem in which the\r\nsecondary tissue consists largely of narrow scalariform tracheae,\r\n_x_²; the primary stele has a diameter of 1 cm.; the secondary xylem,\r\n_x_², forms a fairly broad zone of parenchyma and tracheal elements\r\nthrough which leaf-traces pass vertically, a fact of some interest in\r\ncomparison with the horizontal course which they pursue through the\r\nmedullary rays in the normal secondary wood of _L. vasculare_ and _L.\r\nWünschianum_. The secondary tracheae pass gradually into thin-walled\r\ncambial cells (_a_, fig. 168, D; 170, A) with parallel tangential\r\nwalls. Fig. 171, C, shows the sinuous course of the secondary\r\ntracheae as seen in longitudinal section, and a few small groups of\r\nparenchymatous cells, _mr_, which may be of the nature of medullary\r\nrays, enclosed between the winding scalariform tracheae.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 172. _Lepidodendron fuliginosum._ From a section\r\n  (4 × 3·4 cm.) in the Williamson Collection, British Museum (No.\r\n  379), figured by Williamson, _Phil. Trans. R. Soc._ =1881=, Pl. 52.]\r\n\r\nThe secretory zone of _Lepidodendron fuliginosum_ agrees essentially\r\nwith that of other species; it usually presents the appearance shown\r\nin fig. 168, B, _sc_; fig. 169, B and C; fig. 170, B (longitudinal\r\nsection); fig. 171, D, _sc_. The comparatively large clear spaces which\r\ncharacterise this tissue, as seen in fig. 168, B, appear to owe their\r\norigin to groups of small cells which gradually break down and give\r\nrise to spaces containing remnants of the disorganised elements, as in\r\nfig. 171, D, and fig. 169, B, _b_. The secretory tissue seen in fig.\r\n170, B, consists of large and small parenchymatous cells without any of\r\nthe broad sacs or spaces such as are shown in fig. 169, C.\r\n\r\nFig. 172 represents a diagrammatic sketch of a transverse section (4\r\n× 3·4 cm. in diameter) of a young shoot from the Lower Coal-Measures\r\nof Lancashire figured by Williamson[327] in 1881 as _Lepidodendron\r\nHarcourtii_. It shows the features characteristic of _L. fuliginosum_\r\nand is of importance as affording an example of a shoot giving\r\noff a branch from the stele to supply a lateral axis of the type\r\ncharacteristic of _Halonia_. The exit of the branch-stele forms a\r\ngap in the main stele; a ramular gap as distinguished from a foliar\r\ngap. The outgoing vascular strand is at first crescentic, but becomes\r\ngradually converted into a solid stele. The primary xylem of the main\r\nstele (black in the figure) consists of a ring six tracheae in breadth;\r\nthis is succeeded by a few layers of dark parenchymatous cells and a\r\nband of radially elongated elements, _a_, which abuts on the secretory\r\nzone. The middle lacunar cortex, _c_², with _Stigmaria_ rootlets,\r\n_s_, is fairly well preserved. In the outer cortex occur several\r\nleaf-traces, _lt_, accompanied by spaces originally occupied by the\r\nparichnos strand, _p_. A band of secondary cortex, consisting chiefly\r\nof phelloderm, is seen at _pd_. The prominent leaf-cushions, some of\r\nwhich show the parichnos, _p_, appear to be of the Lepidophloios type.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nIt remains to consider the external characters of Lepidodendroid shoots\r\npossessing the anatomical features represented by the comprehensive\r\nspecies _Lepidodendron fuliginosum_.\r\n\r\nCertain sections exhibiting this type of structure were described by\r\nBinney in 1872 as _Halonia regularis_[328] on evidence supplied by Mr\r\nDawes, who stated that they were cut from a specimen bearing Halonia\r\ntubercles. The section represented in fig. 172 is no doubt from an\r\nHalonia axis. In 1890 Cash and Lomax[329] stated that they had in\r\ntheir possession a stem of the _L. fuliginosum_ type with the external\r\nfeatures of _Lepidophloios_; this identification has been confirmed by\r\nKidston[330] and Weiss[331]. It is, however, equally clear that certain\r\nspecies with the elongated leaf-cushions of _Lepidodendron_ must be\r\nincluded among examples of shoots with the anatomical characters of _L.\r\nfuliginosum_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 173. _Lepidodendron obovatum._ (From a specimen\r\n  lent by Dr D. H. Scott.)]\r\n\r\nDr Scott[332] published in 1906 a short account of the structure\r\nof a specimen from the Lower Coal-Measures of Lancashire, the\r\nexternal features of which were identified by Kidston with those of\r\n_Lepidodendron obovatum_ Sternb. Dr Scott generously allowed me to have\r\ndrawings made from his specimen; these are reproduced in fig. 173. The\r\nform of the leaf-cushion is by no means perfect; there is a well-marked\r\nmedian ridge, and the small circular scar near the upper end of some\r\nof the cushions may represent the ligular cavity. At the base of the\r\nleaf-cushions a cortical meristem has produced a zone of secondary\r\ncortex; at _c_ a second meristem is seen in the outer cortex: the dark\r\ndots in the cortex mark the positions of leaf-trace bundles. The inner\r\ncortex, _d_, is a more compact tissue surrounding the imperfectly\r\npreserved secretory zone. From the medullated stele a lateral branch,\r\n_b_, is being given off; its crescentic form becoming changed to\r\ncircular as it passes nearer to the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 174. _Lepidodendron aculeatum._\r\n  (Cambridge Botany School.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 175. _Lepidodendron aculeatum._\r\n  (Cambridge Botany School.)]\r\n\r\nA type of _Lepidodendron_, _L. Hickii_, founded on anatomical\r\ncharacters by Mr Watson[333], is believed by him to possess\r\nleaf-cushions like those of _L. obovatum_; if this is so, it is\r\ninteresting, as he points out, to find two distinct anatomical types\r\nassociated with one species. Watson thinks it probable that the\r\n“species” _L. obovatum_ includes at least two widely different species.\r\nThis merely emphasizes the importance of correlating structure and\r\nexternal characters as far as available data permit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 176. _Lepidodendron aculeatum._\r\n  (Cambridge Botany School.)]\r\n\r\nThe specimen, of which part of the surface is shown in fig. 174, is\r\nin all probability _L. aculeatum_ Sternb. This was described by me\r\nin detail in _The Annals of Botany_ (1906) as another example of the\r\nco-existence of the _Lepidodendron fuliginosum_ type of anatomy with\r\na true _Lepidodendron_. The locality of the specimen is not known.\r\nThe leaf-cushions are 1·5 cm. long with tapered upper and lower ends;\r\na ligular cavity may be recognised on some parts of the fossil,\r\nalso faint indications of leaf-trace scars. The tubercles (fig.\r\n174, A–C, _t_) probably represent leaf-traces which the shrinkage\r\nof the superficial tissues has rendered visible in the lower part\r\nof their course. The circular scar, _s_ (fig. B), on the partially\r\ndecorticated surface is apparently a wound. The stele is sufficiently\r\nwell preserved to justify its reference to _L. fuliginosum_. The\r\nirregularly crenulated edge of the primary xylem, _x_ (fig. 175),\r\nis succeeded by a broad band of parenchyma (the meristematic zone),\r\n_m_, and beyond this are remnants of the secretory zone, _s_. The\r\nstructure of the leaf-traces corresponds with that of other specimens\r\nof the type, but the much steeper course of these vascular strands,\r\n_lt_, _lt′_ (fig. 176), is a feature in which this example differs\r\nfrom most of those referred to _L. fuliginosum_. Such evidence as is\r\navailable would seem to point to the absence of trustworthy criteria\r\nenabling us to separate, on anatomical grounds, _Lepidophloios_ and\r\n_Lepidodendron_[334].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 177. _Stigmaria radiculosa_ (Hick). (From sections\r\n  in the Manchester University Collection.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stigmaria radiculosa_ (Hick).\r\n\r\nWe have no proof of the nature of the subterranean organs of\r\n_Lepidodendron fuliginosum_, though it is not improbable that the\r\nspecimens described below may be correctly assigned by Weiss to that\r\nspecies. Prof. Weiss[335] has made an interesting contribution to\r\nour knowledge of a type first described by Hick[336] under the name\r\n_Tylophora radiculosa_, a designation which he afterwards altered\r\nto _Xenophyton radiculosum_[337] and for which we may now substitute\r\n_Stigmaria radiculosa_ (Hick). Prof. Williamson expressed the opinion\r\nthat _Xenophyton_ exhibited considerable affinity with _Stigmaria\r\nficoides_ and Weiss’s further study of the species leads him to regard\r\nHick’s plant as probably the Stigmarian organ of _Lepidodendron\r\nfuliginosum_. The diagrammatic transverse section represented in fig.\r\n177, A (4·5 cm. in diameter), shows an outer cortex of parenchyma,\r\n_c_³, consisting in part of radial rows of secondary tissue and of a\r\nband of compact parenchyma bounded by the wavy line _a_; at _sc_ is\r\na series of secretory strands exactly like those in a corresponding\r\nposition in _Lepidodendron fuliginosum_ and other species of the genus.\r\nThe greater part of the organ is occupied by a lacunar and hyphal\r\nmiddle cortex identical in structure with that shown in fig. 178, B,\r\ndrawn from a rootlet. At _d_, fig. 177, A, the middle cortex has been\r\ninvaded by a narrow tongue of outer cortical tissue. The stele is\r\ncharacterised by a large pith filled with parenchyma; in _Stigmaria\r\nficoides_[338] the general absence of pith-tissue has led to the\r\ninference that the stele was hollow. The xylem is represented by a ring\r\nof bundles separated by broad medullary rays; each bundle contains a\r\nfew small, apparently primary, elements on its inner edge but is mainly\r\ncomposed of radial rows of secondary tracheae _x_², fig. 177, B. On\r\nthe outer face of the secondary xylem occur a few smaller and thinner\r\nwalled cells, _c_, having the appearance of meristematic tissue; from\r\nthese additional tracheae were added to the xylem. This meristematic\r\nzone occurs, as in the stems of _Lepidodendron_, immediately internal\r\nto the secretory tissue, sc; at _c_¹, fig. 177, B, is seen the inner\r\ncortical tissue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 178. _Rootlet of Stigmaria._ (From a section in the\r\n  Manchester Collection.)]\r\n\r\nIn surface-view a specimen figured by Hick[339] shows a number of\r\ncircular scars agreeing in shape and arrangement with the rootlet scars\r\nof _Stigmaria ficoides_. At _b_ in fig. 177, A, the basal portion of\r\na rootlet is shown in organic connexion with the outer cortex. The\r\nrootlet-bundles are given off from the stele as in other examples of\r\n_Stigmaria_; each bundle consists of a triangular strand of xylem with\r\nan endarch protoxylem at the narrow end accompanied by a portion of\r\nthe secretory tissue as in the leaf-traces. As in _Stigmaria ficoides_\r\nthe rootlets are attached to the outer cortex above a cushion of small\r\ncells. It is interesting to find that rootlet-bundles, as seen in\r\ntangential section of the main axis, are associated with a parichnos\r\nstrand, but this is on the xylem side of the vascular strand, whereas\r\nin the case of leaf-traces the parichnos is on the other side of the\r\nbundle.\r\n\r\nFig. 178, A, represents a transverse section of a rootlet (6 mm.\r\nin diameter) associated with _Stigmaria radiculosa_ and probably\r\nbelonging to this species. The xylem strand _x_ is composed of a group\r\nof tracheae with a single protoxylem strand, _px_, at the pointed end\r\nand with small metaxylem elements at the broad end next the space\r\noriginally occupied by the so-called phloem. A parenchymatous sheath,\r\n_c′_, surrounds the bundle, and beyond this is the broad middle cortex,\r\na small portion of which is shown on a larger scale in fig. 178, B; as\r\nWeiss points out, some of the outermost cells of the lacunar cortex\r\n(_m_) are clearly in a state of meristematic activity.\r\n\r\nThe preservation of the middle cortex and the small quantity of\r\nsecondary xylem are characters which this _Stigmaria_ shares with\r\n_Lepidodendron fuliginosum_, and although decisive evidence is still to\r\nseek, we may express the opinion that Weiss’s surmise of a connexion\r\nbetween _Stigmaria radiculosa_ and _Lepidodendron fuliginosum_ is\r\nprobably correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Lepidodendron Harcourtii._ Fig. 179, A–D.\r\n\r\nIn 1831 Mr Witham[340] published an anatomical description of a\r\nfragment of a _Lepidodendron_ which he named _Lepidodendron Harcourtii_\r\nafter Mr C. G. V. Vernon Harcourt from whom the specimen was originally\r\nobtained. The fossil was found in rocks belonging to the Calciferous\r\nseries in Northumberland. Witham reproduced the account of this\r\nspecies in his classic work on _Fossil Vegetables_[341], and Lindley\r\nand Hutton[342], who examined Mr Harcourt’s material, published a\r\ndescription of it in their _Fossil Flora_ in which they expressed\r\nthe view that _Lepidodendron_ is intermediate between Conifers and\r\nLycopods. Adolphe Brongniart[343] included in his memoir on _Sigillaria\r\nelegans_ an account of Witham’s species based on material presented to\r\nthe Paris Museum by Mr Hutton and Robert Brown. Dr Kidston[344] has\r\nshown that the actual transverse section figured by Witham is now in\r\nthe York Museum; a piece of stem in the same Museum, which is not the\r\nspecimen from which Witham’s section was cut, supplied the transverse\r\nsection figured by Brongniart. The figures given by Lindley and Hutton\r\ndo not appear to have been made from the York specimens. In 1887\r\nWilliamson[345] published a note in which he pointed out that some of\r\nthe specimens described by him as _L. Harcourtii_ should be transferred\r\nto a distinct species, which he named _L. fuliginosum_. Subsequently\r\nin 1893 he gave a fuller account of Witham’s species; it has, however,\r\nbeen shown by Dr Kidston and by Mr Watson[346] that certain specimens\r\nidentified by Williamson as _L. Harcourtii_ differ sufficiently from\r\nthat type to be placed in another species, for which Watson proposes\r\nthe name _L. Hickii_.\r\n\r\nA paper on _L. Harcourtii_ published by Bertrand[347] in 1891 extends\r\nour knowledge of this type in regard to several anatomical details.\r\nIt was recognised by Williamson that the absence of secondary wood\r\nin shoots possessing the anatomical characters of _L. Harcourtii_\r\nis a feature to which no great importance should be attached. It is\r\npossible that the large stems from the Isle of Arran described by\r\nWilliamson[348] as _Lepidodendron Wünschianum_, in which the secondary\r\nwood is well developed, may be specifically identical with the smaller\r\nspecimens from Northumberland and elsewhere which are recognised as\r\nexamples of Witham’s type.\r\n\r\nThe diagrammatic sketch shown in fig. 179, A, was made from a section\r\nfigured by Williamson in 1893[349]; it has a diameter of 9 × 8·5 cm.\r\nThe stele is of the medullated type like that of _L. Wünschianum_,\r\nand the outer edge of the primary xylem is characterised by sharp and\r\nprominent projecting ridges similar to those of _L. fuliginosum_ but\r\nrather more prominent. Parenchymatous cells succeed the xylem, as in\r\nother species, but in this case there is no indication of meristematic\r\nactivity; beyond this region occur occasional patches of a partially\r\ndestroyed secretory zone. Remains of a lacunar tissue are seen in the\r\nmiddle cortical region; also numerous leaf-traces, _lt_, consisting\r\nof a tangentially elongated xylem strand accompanied by a strand of\r\nsecretory zone tissue enclosed in a sheath of delicate parenchyma. In\r\nthe inner part of the outer cortex, _c_³, the leaf-traces lie in a\r\nspace originally occupied by the parichnos; in the outer portion of\r\nthe same region a band of secondary cortex, _pd_, has been formed;\r\nimmediately internal to this occur numerous patches of secretory\r\ntissue, represented by small dots in the drawing close to _pd_; one is\r\nshown on a larger scale in fig. B.\r\n\r\nThe position of the phellogen is seen at _a_; external to this are\r\nradial rows of rather large cells with dark contents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 179.\r\n\r\n  A–D. _Lepidodendron Harcourtii_, Witham.\r\n  E. _Lepidodendron fuliginosum_, Shore, Lancashire.\r\n  A, B. From a specimen in the Williamson Collection, British Museum\r\n     (No. 380), from Airdrie, Scotland.\r\n  C, D. From sections in the Collection of Dr Kidston, from Shore,\r\n     Lancashire.]\r\n\r\nFig. 179, C, _x_, shows the characteristic form of the primary xylem\r\nedge, beyond which are seen oval or circular leaf-traces with a mesarch\r\nprotoxylem, _lt_, _px_. It is possible that this specimen may not\r\nbe specifically identical with Witham’s species, but it represents\r\na very similar if not identical type; it may on the other hand be\r\nreferable to _L. fuliginosum_. The importance of the specimen, apart\r\nfrom its precise specific position, is that it serves to illustrate the\r\ngeneral appearance of the xylem surface met with in both species, _L.\r\nHarcourtii_ and _L. fuliginosum_. A tangential longitudinal section,\r\ntaken through the line _ab_ in fig. C, is represented in fig. 179, D.\r\nThe xylem of the leaf-traces _lt_, consisting chiefly of scalariform\r\ntracheae, alternates with patches of crushed and delicate parenchyma\r\nwhich immediately abut on the primary xylem; at _p_, _p_, the section\r\npasses through some of the projecting arms of the xylem cylinder; at\r\n_m_ is seen a patch of meristematic zone tissue. This section together\r\nwith the similar section of _Lepidodendron vasculare_ described on a\r\nprevious page demonstrates that the projecting ridges of the primary\r\nxylem form apparently vertical bands: they are not characterised by a\r\nlattice-work arrangement as described by Bertrand and by other authors\r\nwho have accepted his conclusions. If a reticulum of intersecting\r\nridges were present on the face of the xylem cylinder its existence\r\nwould be revealed by such a section as that represented in fig. 179, D.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 180. _Lepidodendron Wünschianum._ From Arran. (⅕\r\n  nat. size.) (Sedgwick Museum, Cambridge.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n6. _Lepidodendron Wünschianum_ (Williamson). Figs. 180–184.\r\n\r\nReference was made in Volume I. to the occurrence of large stems of\r\na Lepidodendron in volcanic beds of Calciferous sandstone age in the\r\nisland of Arran[350]. These were discovered and briefly described by Mr\r\nWünsch in 1867[351] and afterwards named by Carruthers _Lomatophloyos\r\nWünschianus_[352]. Mr Carruthers visited the locality and published\r\nan account of the peculiar method of preservation of the plant\r\nremains[353]. It is, however, to Williamson[354] that we owe the more\r\ncomplete description of these Arran stems. Portions of large stems\r\nfrom the Arran beds are preserved in the British Museum, the Sedgwick\r\nMuseum, Cambridge, and in the Manchester Museum. The section of one of\r\nthese is shown in fig. 180; an outer shell of bark encloses a mass of\r\nvolcanic ash in which are embedded several woody cylinders originally\r\ndescribed as “internal piths[355],” and by Carruthers as young stems\r\nproduced from spores which had germinated in the hollow trunk of a\r\nlarge tree. The true interpretation was supplied by Williamson who\r\nshowed that a stem of the dimensions of that represented by the outer\r\ncortex, _e_, fig. 180, must have possessed a single stele of the size\r\nof those seen in the interior of the hollow trunk. The additional woody\r\ncylinders, or steles, were derived from other stems, and carried,\r\nprobably by water, into the partially decayed trunk. In addition to\r\nlarge Lepidodendron stems Williamson described smaller shoots as well\r\nas an Halonial branch and made brief reference to some cones described\r\nby Binney[356] in 1871 from the same locality.\r\n\r\nThe following account of _Lepidodendron Wünschianum_ is based on an\r\nexceptionally fine specimen discovered by Mr T. Kerr of Edinburgh in\r\nCalciferous sandstone volcanic ashes at Dalmeny in Linlithgowshire. The\r\nmaterial from this locality described by Mr Hill and myself[357] was\r\ngenerously placed in my hands by Dr Kidston of Stirling. Fig. 181, A,\r\nshows a transverse section, 33 cm. in diameter, consisting of a shell\r\nof outer cortical tissue enclosing a core of light-coloured volcanic\r\nash; on the decay of the more delicate middle cortex the cylindrical\r\nstele dropped to one side of the hollow trunk. The stele, fig. 182, has\r\na diameter of 6·5 cm.; the centre is occupied by concentric layers of\r\nsilica, _s_, surrounded externally by the remains of a parenchymatous\r\npith, _p_, made up of isodiametric and sinuous hypha-like elements\r\nlike those in the middle cortex of Lepidodendron shoots. On the inner\r\nedge of the primary xylem, _x′_, occur several isodiametric tracheae\r\nwith fine scalariform and reticulate thickening bands like those in\r\nthe central region of the stele of _Lepidodendron vasculare_: it is\r\nprobable that these elements are vestiges of conducting tissue which in\r\nancestral forms formed a solid and not a medullated stele.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 181. _Lepidodendron Wünschianum._ Calciferous\r\n  Sandstone, Dalmeny. (A, Sedgwick Museum, Cambridge. B–F, Botany\r\n  School, Cambridge.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 182. _Lepidodendron Wünschianum._ The stele of\r\n  the stem shown in fig. 181, A. (Cambridge Botany School.)]\r\n\r\nThe primary xylem is limited externally by an unequally fluted surface\r\nwith exarch protoxylem elements; it is, however, noteworthy that there\r\nis not always a very clearly defined difference between the small\r\nprotoxylem and the large centripetally developed tracheae. Immediately\r\nbeyond the primary xylem occur numerous thin-walled parenchymatous\r\ncells with spiral and reticulate pitting; beyond these is the broad\r\nzone of secondary xylem, _x_², composed of scalariform tracheae and\r\nnumerous medullary rays consisting of one, two, or several rows of\r\nradially elongated elements with spiral and reticulate pitting. In\r\ntangential sections the rays are seen to vary considerably in size,\r\nsome being made up of a single row of cells while others are longer and\r\nbroader; through the latter leaf-traces pass horizontally. Portions of\r\nmedullary rays are seen at _mr_ in fig. 181, C and E.\r\n\r\nThe leaf-traces given off from projecting ridges on the outer edge\r\nof the primary xylem pass upwards for a short distance and then bend\r\noutwards through a broad medullary ray; on reaching the limit of\r\nthe secondary xylem they again bend sharply upwards, appearing in\r\ntransverse section at _lt_ fig. 181, B. Each leaf-trace consists at\r\nfirst of long tracheae accompanied by numerous thin-walled spiral\r\nand reticulate parenchymatous cells derived from the tissue in\r\ncontact with the outer edge of the primary wood. Fig. 181, B, shows\r\na leaf-trace near the edge of the secondary xylem; it consists of a\r\ngroup of primary tracheae, with narrower protoxylem elements, _px_,\r\nnear the outer margin, almost completely enclosed by radially disposed\r\nseries of smaller and more delicate tracheae. These secondary elements\r\nof the leaf-trace are apparently added during its passage through\r\nthe medullary ray, but additions are also made to this tissue by\r\nthe meristematic zone, _m_, fig. 181, B and E. In contact with the\r\noutermost tracheae of normal size at the edge of the secondary xylem\r\nthere are some smaller lignified elements, as at _a_, fig. 181, E, and\r\nat T, fig. 183; this juxtaposition of large and small tracheae has been\r\nreferred to in the description of _L. vasculare_.\r\n\r\nProf. Williamson[358], in his account of the Arran specimens of this\r\nspecies, expressed the opinion that the trees probably perished “in\r\nconsequence of the mephitic vapours which filled the atmosphere”; it\r\nmaybe that in the striking difference in the diameter of the conducting\r\nelements on the margin of the wood we have evidence of approaching\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nBeyond the most recently formed tracheae we have a band of delicate\r\nparenchymatous cells (_m_, figs. B and E, 181; C, figs. 183, 184)\r\nforming the meristematic zone[359]. The longitudinal section\r\nrepresented in fig. 184 shows some recently formed narrow tracheae, T,\r\nand beyond these the meristematic zone composed of thin-walled short\r\ncells, C, arranged in horizontal rows. It is this small-celled tissue\r\nto which the name phloem has been applied by some authors[360], a\r\nterm which seems to me to be misleading and inappropriate. In passing\r\nthrough this zone of dividing cells the leaf-traces become surrounded\r\nby an arc of meristem from which elements are added to the radially\r\nplaced rows of secondary tracheae. Beyond the meristematic region\r\nportions of the secretory zone are preserved, consisting of large\r\nsacs or spaces and small dark cells as seen in figs. 181, B, E, _sc_,\r\nF; 183, 184. This tissue has the same structure as in _L. vasculare_\r\nand in _L. fuliginosum_: it is a striking fact that there are no\r\nindications of any additions to the secretory zone even in stems with\r\nsuch a large amount of secondary xylem as in the Dalmeny specimen (fig.\r\n182, _x_²). If the secretory zone were of the nature of phloem we\r\nshould expect to see signs of additions made to it in the course of\r\ngrowth. In this connexion it is worth mentioning that in the recent\r\nfern _Botrychium_ (Ophioglossaceae) secondary xylem is formed in the\r\nstem, but apparently no additions are made to the phloem. The structure\r\nof the secretory zone tissue as seen in the longitudinal section\r\nfig. 184, S, is also a serious difficulty in the way of accepting\r\nthe designation phloem as employed by Scott and Weiss. Between the\r\nsecretory zone and the outer cortical region, no tissues have been\r\npreserved. The shell of bark consists chiefly of radial rows of\r\nelongated cells with rather thick walls characterised by the occurrence\r\nof small intercellular spaces and by tangentially placed bands of\r\nsecretory cells and sacs (fig. 181, D, _s_). Immediately internal to\r\nthe secondary cortex or phelloderm occur groups of secretory tissue as\r\nshown in the section of _L. Harcourtii_ (fig. 179, B).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 183. _Lepidodendron Wünschianum._ From the\r\n  specimen shown in fig. 181, S, secretory zone; C, meristem; T,\r\n  immature tracheae.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 184. _Lepidodendron Wünschianum._ Longitudinal\r\n  section of the specimen represented in transverse section in fig.\r\n  183.]\r\n\r\nThe large tree shown in transverse section in fig. 181, A, has\r\nlost its leaf-cushions; the bark, as seen in the lower part of the\r\nphotograph, presents a fissured appearance like that with which we\r\nare familiar on an old Oak or Elm stem. A radial longitudinal section\r\nthrough the phelloderm revealed the existence of a crushed leaf-trace\r\npassing outwards in an approximately horizontal course accompanied\r\nby a strand of parenchymatous tissue[361] having the characteristic\r\nstructure of a parichnos. It is probable that the surface of this\r\npartially decorticated stem differed in appearance from that of an old\r\n_Sigillaria_ (cf. fig. 198) in the much smaller and less conspicuous\r\nparichnos strands.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the large stems of _L. Wünschianum_ from Arran and\r\nDalmeny numerous examples of smaller axes from the former locality are\r\nrepresented in the Williamson collection (British Museum). Some of\r\nthe twigs are characterised by a solid stele (protostele) giving off\r\nnumerous leaf-traces accompanied by short spirally thickened tracheids\r\nlike those which occur at the outer edge of the primary xylem in\r\nthe larger stem: these extend into the leaf where they are arranged\r\nround the vascular bundle like the transfusion tracheids[362] in many\r\nrecent conifers. The surface of these smaller shoots bears large\r\nleaf-cushions which are seen in longitudinal section to have the form\r\ncharacteristic of _Lepidophloios_. It is worthy of note that a section\r\nof a bifurcating axis of this species from the Calciferous Sandstone of\r\nCraigleith (British Museum Collection[363]), although its diameter is\r\n19 × 14 cm., shows no signs of secondary wood. This late appearance of\r\nsecondary xylem and other anatomical features suggest the possibility\r\nof the specific identity of _L. Wünschianum_ and _L. Harcourtii_[364].\r\n\r\nIn 1871 Binney[365] described a specimen of a heterosporous cone,\r\n_Lepidostrobus Wünschianus_, from Arran exhibiting the ordinary\r\nfeatures of lepidodendroid strobili; this was probably borne by\r\n_Lepidodendron Wünschianum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. _Lepidodendron macrophyllum_ (Williamson). Fig. 186, C.\r\n\r\nThe diagrammatic sketch reproduced in fig. 186, C, was made from the\r\ntransverse section of a small twig, slightly less than 2 cm. in its\r\nlongest diameter, originally figured by Williamson[366] in 1872.\r\nEarlier in the same year Carruthers[367] published a short account\r\nof the same form based on specimens collected by Mr Butterworth\r\nfrom the Coal-Measures of Lancashire near Oldham, but both authors\r\nrefrained from instituting a new specific name. In a later publication\r\nWilliamson spoke of the type as _Lepidodendron macrophyllum_[368].\r\nWilliamson’s species has nothing to do with _Lycopodites macrophyllus_\r\nof Goldenberg[369]. The most striking feature of this rare form is\r\nthe large size of the leaf-cushions, which are of the _Lepidophloios_\r\ntype, in proportion to the diameter of the shoot. The stele consists\r\nof a ring of xylem, all of which is primary in the sections so far\r\ndescribed, enclosing a parenchymatous pith: a Stigmarian rootlet is\r\nshown at _s_.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. _Lepidodendron Veltheimianum_ Sternb.

III.\r\n\r\nThe above list may serve to call attention to a few synonyms[370]\r\nof this plant, and to a selection of sources from which full\r\ninformation may be obtained as to the history of our knowledge of this\r\ncharacteristic and widely spread Lower Carboniferous type.\r\n\r\n_Lepidodendron Veltheimianum_ is represented by casts of stems,\r\nthe largest of which hitherto described reaches a length of 5·22\r\nmetres with a maximum diameter of 63 cm.; this specimen, figured\r\nby Stur[371], consists of a tapered main axis giving off smaller\r\nlateral shoots, some of which exhibit dichotomous branching. Fig.\r\n185, C and D, represent the external features of a well-preserved\r\ncast and impression respectively. Oblique rows of prominent cushions\r\nwind round the surface of the stem and branches: each cushion is\r\nprolonged upwards and downwards in the form of a narrow ridge with\r\nsloping sides which connects adjacent cushions by an ogee curve. At\r\nthe upper limit of the broader kite-shaped portion of the cushion\r\nthe ligular pit forms a conspicuous feature; immediately below this\r\nis the leaf-scar with its three small scars,—the lateral parichnos\r\nstrands and the central leaf-trace. The two oval areas shown in fig.\r\n185, D, just below the lower edge of the leaf-scars, represent the\r\nparichnos arms which impinge on the surface of the cushions on their\r\nway to the leaves, as explained on a previous page. It is possible\r\nthat these areas were visible on the living stem as strands of loose\r\nparenchyma comparable with the lenticel-like pits on the stipules of\r\n_Angiopteris_[372] and the leaf-bases of Cyatheaceous ferns, or it may\r\nbe that their prominence in the specimen before us is the result of\r\nthe decay of a thin layer of superficial cortex which hid them on the\r\nliving tree. Fig. 185, B, illustrates the appearance of a stem in a\r\npartially decorticated condition (_Bergeria_ state). A further degree\r\nof decortication is seen in fig. 185, A, which represents the _Knorria_\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 185. _Lepidodendron Veltheimianum._ From specimens\r\n  in Dr Kidston’s Collection. (Approximately nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nFig. 157 shows a Ulodendron axis of this species; in the lower part the\r\nspecimen illustrates the partial obliteration of the surface features\r\nas the result of the splitting of the outer bark consequent on growth\r\nin thickness of the tree. By an extension of the cracks, shown in an\r\nearly stage in fig. 157, the leaf-cushions would be entirely destroyed\r\nand the surface of the bark would be characterised by longitudinal\r\nfissures simulating the vertical grooves and ridges of a Sigillarian\r\nstem. The large stumps of trees shown in the frontispiece to Volume I.\r\nare probably, as Kidston[373] suggests, trunks of _L. Veltheimianum_ in\r\nwhich the leaf-cushions have been replaced by irregular longitudinal\r\nfissures. In old stems of _Sigillaria_ the enlarged parichnos areas\r\nconstitute a characteristic feature (p. 205), but it does not follow\r\nthat the absence of large parichnos scars is a distinguishing feature\r\nof all _Lepidodendra_.\r\n\r\nIn this species, as in others, the form of the leaf-cushion exhibits\r\na considerable range of variation dependent on the thickness of the\r\nshoot; the contiguous cushions of young branches become stretched apart\r\nas the result of increasing girth of the whole organ, and casts of\r\nstill older branches may exhibit very different surface-features[374].\r\nThe leaves as seen on impressions of slender branches are comparatively\r\nshort, reaching a length of 1–2 cm. It is important to notice that\r\nleafy twigs of this species may bear terminal cones[375] resembling\r\nin form those of _Picea excelsa_ and other recent conifers, though\r\ndiffering essentially in their morphological features.\r\n\r\nThe fossil stumps of trees represented in the frontispiece to Volume\r\nI. bear horizontally spreading and dichotomously branched root-like\r\norgans having the characters of _Stigmaria ficoides_[376]. Geinitz has\r\nsuggested that _Stigmaria inaequalis_ Göpp. may be the underground\r\nportion of _Lepidodendron Veltheimianum_.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunately seldom possible to connect petrified\r\n_Lepidodendron_ cones with particular species of the genus based on\r\npurely vegetative characters, but it is practically certain that we are\r\njustified in recognising certain strobili described by Williamson[377]\r\nfrom the Calciferous Sandstone series of Burntisland on the Firth of\r\nForth as those of _Lepidodendron Veltheimianum_. Williamson believed\r\nthat the cone which he described belonged to the plant with shoots\r\ncharacterised by the anatomical features of his species _Lepidodendron\r\nbrevifolium_ (= _L. Veltheimianum_), a conclusion which is confirmed by\r\nKidston[378]. The cone of _L. Veltheimianum_, which reached a diameter\r\nof at least 1 cm. and a length of 4 cm., agrees in essentials with\r\nother species of _Lepidostrobus_; the axis has a single medullated\r\nstele of the same general type as that of the vegetative shoots of\r\n_Lepidodendron fuliginosum_ and _L. Harcourtii_. The sporophylls are\r\ndescribed by Williamson as spirally disposed, and Scott notices that\r\nin some specimens they are arranged in alternate whorls; as in recent\r\nLycopods both forms of phyllotaxis may occur in the same species. The\r\nheterosporous nature of this strobilus, to which Scott first applied\r\nthe name _Lepidostrobus Veltheimianus_, is clearly demonstrated by the\r\ntwo longitudinal sections contributed by Mr Carruthers and figured by\r\nWilliamson in 1893[379].\r\n\r\nEach sporophyll, attached almost at right angles to the cone-axis,\r\nbears a radially elongated sporangium seated on the median line of\r\nits upper face; its margins are laterally expanded as a thin lamina;\r\nfrom the middle of the lower face a narrow keel extends downwards\r\nbetween two sporangia belonging to a lower series. From the base of a\r\nsporangium a mass of sterile tissue penetrates into the spore-producing\r\nregion as in the large sporangia of _Isoetes_ (cf. fig. 191, H, _a_,\r\nand fig. 133, H). The distal and free portion of the sporophylls is\r\nbent upwards as a protecting bract. Some of the sporangia in the upper\r\npart of the cone produced numerous microspores, while 8–16 megaspores\r\noccur in the lower sporangia. The megaspores, having a mean diameter\r\nof 0·8 mm. “quite 40 times the size of the microspores[380],” are\r\ncharacterised by tubular capitate appendages, and by a conspicuous\r\nthree-lobed projection (fig. 191, E)[381] which, as Scott suggests,\r\nmay represent the outer spore-wall which has split as the result of\r\ngermination. It is not improbable, as shown in fig. 191, I, that this\r\ncap was present before germination. The megaspores represented in fig.\r\n191, I, illustrate their characteristic form as seen in a section of a\r\nmegasporangium, _Sm_; the open beak-like portion of the larger spore is\r\nprobably the apical region which has split along the three-rayed lines.\r\nThese lines form a characteristic feature of both recent and extinct\r\nspores and denote their origin in tetrads. The spore shown in fig. 191,\r\nE[382], illustrates the external features. The apical region of the\r\nprothallus of a megaspore of _Lepidodendron Veltheimianum_ described\r\nby Mr Gordon[383] consists of smaller cells than those occupying the\r\ngreater part of the spore-cavity, a differentiation which he compares\r\nwith that of the prothallus of _Selaginella_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 186.\r\n\r\n  A, B. _Lepidodendron Veltheimianum._ (Botany School, Cambridge.)\r\n  C. _Lepidodendron macrophyllum._ (British Museum. No. 377.)\r\n  _x_, Primary xylem; _x_², secondary xylem; _s_, Stigmarian rootlet.]\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that the petrified shoots described by\r\nWilliamson[384] from the Calciferous Sandstone beds of Burntisland as\r\n_Lepidodendron brevifolium_ are identical with specimens possessing\r\nthe external features of _L. Veltheimianum_. In 1872 Dawson expressed\r\nthe opinion that Williamson’s species should be referred to _L.\r\nVeltheimianum_, and evidence subsequently obtained confirms this\r\nview. The stele of this species is of the medullated type, differing\r\nfrom that of _L. fuliginosum_ and _L. Harcourtii_ in the absence of\r\nprominent ridges on the external surface of the primary xylem, and from\r\n_L. vasculare_ in the possession of a parenchymatous pith. In younger\r\ntwigs the cortex consists of fairly homogeneous tissue, but in older\r\nbranches there is a greater distinction between a delicate middle\r\ncortex and a stronger outer cortex. Fig. 186, A, represents a stem\r\nin which the vascular cylinder is composed of a primary xylem ring,\r\n_x_, 1·5 mm. broad, succeeded by a zone of secondary wood 1·2 cm. in\r\nbreadth. The junction between the primary and secondary xylem is shown\r\non a larger scale in fig. 186, B. The tissues abutting on the secondary\r\nxylem have not been preserved; the outer cortex, which consists\r\nchiefly of secondary elements, is divided superficially into unequal\r\nridges corresponding to the leaf-cushions which have been more or less\r\nobliterated as the result of growth in thickness of the stem.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. _Lepidodendron Pedroanum_ (Carruthers).\r\n\r\nIn 1869 Mr Carruthers described some specimens of vegetative stems and\r\nisolated sporangia, collected by Mr Plant in Brazil, as _Flemingites\r\nPedroanus_[385]. From a more recent account published by Zeiller[386]\r\nit is clear that Carruthers’ species is a true _Lepidodendron_; an\r\nexamination of the type-specimens in the British Museum confirms this\r\ndetermination. The contiguous leaf-cushions have rounded angles similar\r\nin form to those of _Lepidodendron Veltheimianum_ and _L. dichotomum_,\r\nbut it is not unlikely that the Brazilian plant is specifically\r\ndistinct from European species. A figure of one of the specimens on\r\nwhich Carruthers founded the species is given by Arber[387] in his\r\n_Glossopteris Flora_. The Brazilian plant is chiefly interesting as\r\naffording proof of the existence of _Lepidodendron_ in the southern\r\nhemisphere; the species has also been recognised in South Africa from\r\nmaterial collected by Mr Leslie at Vereeniging[388].\r\n\r\nAs Zeiller[389] has suggested, it is not improbable that the fossils\r\ndescribed by Renault[390] from Brazil as _Lycopodiopsis Derbyi_ may be\r\nthe petrified stems of _Lepidodendron Pedroanum_. The structure of the\r\ncentral cylinder of Renault’s species is of the type represented by _L.\r\nHarcourtii_; the xylem forms a continuous ring and does not consist of\r\nseparate strands of tracheae as Renault believed.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. _Lepidodendron australe_ (M’Coy). Figs. 187, A–C.\r\n\r\nSpecimens described under this name are interesting rather on account\r\nof their extended geographical range and geological antiquity than\r\non botanical grounds. The drawings reproduced in fig. 187 illustrate\r\nthe characteristic appearance of this Lower Carboniferous and Upper\r\nDevonian type, as represented by a specimen recently described[391]\r\nfrom the Lower Karroo (Dwyka) series, which is probably of\r\nCarboniferous age, near Orange River Station, South Africa. The surface\r\nis divided into polygonal or rhomboidal areas (figs. A and B) 8–9 mm.\r\nlong and 7–8 mm. broad, arranged in regular series and representing\r\nleaf-scars, comparable with those of _Sigillaria Brardi_ and other\r\nspecies, or possibly partially decorticated leaf-cushions. A short\r\ndistance below the apex of each area there is a more or less circular\r\nprominence or depression (fig. 187, B) and on a few of the areas there\r\nare indications of a groove (fig. A, _g_) extending from the raised\r\nscar to the pointed base, as at _g_, _g_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 187. _Lepidodendron australe._ Fig. A, nat. size.]\r\n\r\nIn examining the graphitic layer on the surface of the South African\r\nspecimen shown in fig. 187, A, use was made of a method recently\r\ndescribed by Professor Nathorst[392]. A few drops of collodion were\r\nplaced on the surface, and after a short interval the film was removed\r\nand mounted on a slide. The addition of a stain facilitated the\r\nmicroscopic examination and the drawing of the collodion film. The\r\ncell-outlines (fig. 187, C) on the surface of the polygonal areas\r\nmay be those of the epidermis, but they were more probably formed by\r\na subepidermal tissue; the scar, which interrupts the continuity of\r\nthe flat surface, may mark the position of a leaf-base, or, assuming\r\na partial decortication to have occurred prior to fossilisation, it\r\nmay represent a gap in the cortical tissue caused by the decay of\r\ndelicate tissue which surrounded the vascular bundle of each leaf in\r\nits course through the cortex of the stem. If the impression were\r\nthat of the actual surface of a _Lepidodendron_ or a _Sigillaria_,\r\nwe should expect to find traces of the parichnos appearing on the\r\nleaf-scar as two small scars, one on each side of the leaf-bundle.\r\nIn specimens from Vereeniging described in 1897[393] as _Sigillaria\r\nBrardi_, which bear a superficial resemblance to that shown in fig. A,\r\nthe parichnos is clearly shown. On the other hand, an impression of a\r\npartially decorticated Lepidodendroid stem need not necessarily show\r\nthe parichnos as a distinct feature: owing to its close association\r\nwith the leaf-trace in the outer cortex, before its separation in the\r\nform of two diverging arms, it would not appear as a distinct gap apart\r\nfrom that representing the leaf-bundle. The absence of the parichnos\r\nmay be regarded as a point in favour of the view that the impression\r\nis that of a partially decorticated stem. Similarly, the absence of\r\nany demarcation between a leaf-cushion and a true leaf-scar such as\r\ncharacterises the stems of Lepidodendra and many Sigillariae is also\r\nfavourable to the same interpretation.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 Mr Carruthers[394] described some fossils from Queensland,\r\nsome of which appear to be identical with that shown in fig. 187\r\nunder the name _Lepidodendron nothum_, Unger[395], a species founded\r\non Upper Devonian specimens from Thuringia. The Queensland plant is\r\nprobably identical with Dawson’s Canadian species, _Leptophloeum\r\nrhombicum_[396]. In 1874 M’Coy[397] instituted the name _Lepidodendron\r\naustrale_ for some Lower Carboniferous specimens from Victoria,\r\nAustralia: these are in all probability identical with the Queensland\r\nfossils referred by Carruthers to Unger’s species, but as the identity\r\nof the German and Australian plants is very doubtful[398] it is better\r\nto adopt M’Coy’s specific designation.\r\n\r\nKrasser[399] has described a similar, but probably not specifically\r\nidentical, type from China; from Devonian rocks of Spitzbergen\r\nNathorst[400] has figured, under the name _Bergeria_, an example of\r\nthis form of stem, and Szajnocha[401] has described other specimens\r\nfrom Lower Carboniferous strata in the Argentine.\r\n\r\n_Lepidodendron australe_ has been recorded from several Australian\r\nlocalities[402] from strata below those containing the genus\r\n_Glossopteris_ and other members of the Glossopteris, or, as it has\r\nrecently been re-christened, the Gangamopteris[403] Flora.\r\n\r\n\r\n               viii. _Fertile shoots of_ Lepidodendron.\r\n\r\nA. _Lepidostrobus._\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Lepidostrobus_ was first used by Brongniart[404]\r\nfor the cones of _Lepidodendron_, the type-species of the genus being\r\n_Lepidostrobus ornatus_, the designation given by the author of the\r\ngenus to a Lepidostrobus previously figured by Parkinson[405] in his\r\n_Organic Remains of a Former World_. The generic name _Flemingites_\r\nproposed by Carruthers[406] in 1865, under a misapprehension as to\r\nthe nature of spores which he identified as sporangia, was applied\r\nto specimens of true _Lepidostrobi_. Brongniart also instituted the\r\ngeneric name _Lepidophyllum_ for detached leaves of _Lepidodendron_,\r\nboth vegetative and fertile; the specimen figured by him in 1822 as\r\n_Filicites_ (_Glossopteris_) _dubius_[407], and which was afterwards\r\nmade the type-species of the genus, was recognised as being a portion\r\nof the lanceolate limb of a large single-veined sporophyll belonging to\r\na species of _Lepidostrobus_.\r\n\r\nIn an unusually large _Lepidophyllum_, or detached sporophyll of\r\n_Lepidostrobus_, in the Manchester University Museum, the free laminar\r\nportion reaches a length of 8 cm.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon to find _Lepidodendron_ preserved in the form of a\r\nshell of outer cortex, which has become separated along the phellogen\r\nfrom the rest of the stem; as the result of compression the cylinder\r\nof bark may assume the appearance of a flattened stem covered with\r\nleaf-cushions. A specimen preserved in this way was described by\r\nE. Weiss as a cone of _Lomatophloios macrolepidotus_ Gold., and is\r\nquoted by Solms-Laubach and other authors[408] as an example of an\r\nunusually large _Lepidostrobus_. An examination of the type-specimen\r\nin the Bergakademie of Berlin convinced me that Weiss had mistaken\r\nthe partially destroyed leaf-cushions for sporophylls, and Stigmarian\r\nrootlets, which had invaded the empty space, for sporangia[409].\r\n\r\nIn external appearance some species of _Lepidostrobus_ bear a\r\nsuperficial resemblance to the cone of a Spruce Fir (_Picea excelsa_),\r\nbut the surface of a lycopodiaceous strobilus is usually covered by\r\nthe overlapping and upturned laminae which terminate the more or less\r\nhorizontal sporangium-bearing portion of the sporophyll.\r\n\r\nFig. 188 affords a good example of a long and narrow _Lepidostrobus_.\r\nThis specimen from the Middle Coal-Measures of Lancashire has a length\r\nof 23 cm.; like other _Lepidostrobi_ it is borne at the tip of a\r\nslender shoot. The fossil is sufficiently well preserved to show the\r\ncharacteristic radially elongated form of the large sporangia and the\r\nlong and upturned distal portions of the sporophylls.\r\n\r\nWe may briefly describe _Lepidostrobus_ as follows:—Cylindrical\r\nstrobili consisting of an axis containing a single cylindrical stele\r\nwhich agrees generally with that of the vegetative shoots of _L.\r\nHarcourtii_ and other species. The amount of parenchymatous pith\r\nvaries in different forms; in some the primary xylem is almost solid.\r\nThe middle cortical region, which has usually been destroyed before\r\nfossilisation, possesses the loose lacunar structure characteristic\r\nof this region in the vegetative branches. The thicker walled outer\r\ncortex is continued at the periphery into crowded, usually spirally\r\ndisposed sporophylls, each of which consists of a more or less\r\nhorizontal pedicel, which may be characterised by a keel-like median\r\nridge on its lower surface, while to the central region of the upper\r\nface is attached a large radially elongated sporangium. One of the\r\nchief differences between a _Lepidodendron_ cone and those of the\r\nrecent genus _Lycopodium_ is the greater radial elongation of the\r\nsporangia in the former. Some species of _Lepidostrobus_ may have been\r\nhomosporous; some are known to be heterosporous. In the latter the\r\nmegasporangia borne on the lower sporophylls usually contain several\r\nmegaspores as in _Isoetes_ (cf. fig. 133, E). Beyond the distal end of\r\nthe sporangium the sporophyll becomes broader in a horizontal plane and\r\nis bent upwards as a lanceolate limb; it may also be prolonged a short\r\ndistance downwards as a bluntly triangular expansion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 188. _Lepidostrobus._ Middle Coal-Measures,\r\n  Bardsley, Lancashire. From a specimen in the Manchester Museum.\r\n  (½ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that the Palaeozoic _Lepidodendra_, like\r\n_Lycopodium cernuum_ (fig. 123) and other recent Lycopods, usually\r\nbore their cones at the tips of slender shoots. The fertile shoot of\r\n_Lepidophloios scoticus_ shown in fig. 160, B, affords one of several\r\ninstances supporting this statement; similar examples are figured\r\nby Brongniart[410], Morris[411], and by more recent writers. The\r\napparently sessile cone figured by Williamson[412] from a specimen in\r\nthe Manchester Museum is certainly not _in situ_, but is accidentally\r\nassociated with the stem.\r\n\r\nThe general absence of secondary wood in the steles of _Lepidostrobi_\r\nis, as Dr Kidston[413] points out, consistent with the view that the\r\ncones were shed on maturity and that fertilisation probably took place\r\non the ground, or perhaps on the surface of the water where the slender\r\nhairs of the megaspores (fig. 191, F, I) may have served to catch the\r\nmicrospores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 189. _Lepidostrobus._ Section through the apical\r\n  region of a cone above the axis. (Manchester University\r\n  Collection.)]\r\n\r\nFig. 189 is an accurate representation of a transverse section,\r\n6 mm. in diameter, of what is no doubt the apical portion of a\r\n_Lepidostrobus_ from the Coal-Measures of Shore, Lancashire. The\r\nsection cuts across the upturned free laminae above the level of the\r\napex of the cone-axis. Each lamina contains a small vascular bundle\r\ncomposed of a few tracheae and some thin-walled cells surrounded by\r\ndelicate mesophyll tissue. Immediately in front of the distal end\r\nof a sporangium a small ligule is borne on the upper face of the\r\nsporophyll (fig. 191, A, B, _l_) occupying the same position as in\r\n_Selaginella_ (cf. fig. 131, F). Strands of vascular tissue pass in a\r\nsteeply ascending course from the xylem to the pedicels of sporophylls,\r\nfinally curving upwards and ending in the upper limb. Each vascular\r\nbundle consists of a strand of xylem, apparently of mesarch structure,\r\naccompanied by a few layers of parenchyma on its outer face and by\r\na group of cambiform elements, the whole being enclosed in a sheath\r\nof parenchyma continuous with the inner cortex of the cone axis. The\r\nvascular bundle is accompanied by a parichnos in the outer cortex and\r\nin the sporophyll.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the belief on the part of some\r\npalaeobotanists that the large scars of _Ulodendron_ represent\r\nattachment-surfaces of sessile cones, and reasons have been given\r\nagainst the acceptance of this view.\r\n\r\nThere is considerable range in the size of _Lepidostrobi_. An\r\nincomplete specimen, 33 cm. long and 6 cm. broad, which may have been\r\n50 cm. in length, is described by Renault and Zeiller[414] from the\r\nCommentry Coal-field. The larger cones afford a striking demonstration\r\nof the enormous spore-output of some species of _Lepidodendron_.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest accounts of the anatomy of _Lepidostrobus_ are those\r\nby Hooker[415] and Binney[416]. One of the specimens described by the\r\nformer author (fig. 190) affords an interesting example of an unusual\r\nmanner of fossilisation; a hollow stem or _Lepidodendron_ is filled\r\nwith sedimentary material containing several pieces of _Lepidostrobi_\r\nin an approximately vertical position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 190. _Lepidodendron_ stem with _Lepidostrobi_.\r\n  (After Hooker.)\r\n\r\n  A. Side-view showing leaf-cushions on the left-hand side and the\r\n     _Knorria_ condition on the right.\r\n  B. View of transverse section; _s_, sections of _Lepidostrobi_.]\r\n\r\nThe fact that _Lepidostrobi_ usually occur as isolated specimens\r\nrenders it impossible in most cases to refer them to particular species\r\nof _Lepidodendron_. Neither external features nor anatomical characters\r\nafford satisfactory criteria by which to correlate vegetative and\r\nfertile shoots; in some measure this is due to the imperfection of\r\nour knowledge as regards the range of structure within the limits of\r\nspecies; it is also due to lack of information as to the extent to\r\nwhich the transition from sterile to fertile portions of a shoot is\r\naccompanied by anatomical differences. Prof. Williamson wrote: “I have\r\nfor many years endeavoured to discover some specific characters by\r\nwhich different _Lepidostrobi_ can be distinguished and identified, but\r\nthus far my efforts have been unsuccessful[417].” In a few cases, such\r\nas those mentioned in the description of _Lepidodendron Veltheimianum_\r\nand _L. Wünschianum_, it has been possible to correlate cones and\r\nvegetative shoots.\r\n\r\nThe most complete account we possess of the anatomy of _Lepidodendron_\r\ncones is that by Mr Maslen[418], who first demonstrated the occurrence\r\nof a ligule on the sporophylls, and thus supplied a missing piece of\r\nevidence in support of the generally accepted view as to the homology\r\nof the sporangium-bearing members and foliage leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. _Lepidostrobus variabilis_ (Lindley and Hutton).\r\n\r\n  1811. “Strobilus,” Parkinson, Organic Remains, Vol. I. p. 428, Pl.\r\n        IX. fig. 1.\r\n  1828. _Lepidostrobus ornatus_, Brongniart, Prodrome, p. 87.\r\n  1831. _L. variabilis_, Lindley and Hutton, Foss.

The cylindrical cones vary considerably in size, some reaching a\r\nlength of 50 cm. or more. The sporophylls are attached by a pedicel,\r\n4–8 mm. long, at right angles to the axis, while the distal portion\r\nforms an oval lanceolate limb 10–20 mm. in length. The sporangia are\r\n4–8 mm. long.\r\n\r\nThe branched example figured by Lindley and Hutton[419] as a variety\r\n(L. _ornatus_ var. _didymus_) illustrates a phenomenon not uncommon in\r\nboth Palaeozoic and recent lycopodiaceous strobili.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 191. _Lepidostrobus._\r\n\r\n  A–D. _L. oldhamius._\r\n  B, C, D.

Fig. 191, A–D.\r\n\r\nWilliamson[421] instituted this term for strobili previously\r\ndescribed by Binney[422], without adequate evidence, as the cones of\r\n_Lepidodendron Harcourtii_. In shape and in the main morphological\r\nfeatures this type resembles _L. variabilis_, which is however known\r\nonly in the form of casts and impressions. A cone of _L. oldhamius_,\r\n2–3 cm. in diameter, possesses a medullated stele consisting of a\r\nring of primary xylem (fig. 191, D, _x_) with exarch protoxylem and\r\nno secondary elements. Maslen found several short tracheae at the\r\nperiphery of the xylem and states that these led him to compare the\r\ncone with the vegetative shoots of _Lepidodendron vasculare_, but\r\nthe common occurrence of such elements in different types of shoot\r\nrenders them of little or no specific value. The inner cortex is like\r\nthat of vegetative shoots of _Lepidodendron_ and the middle cortex,\r\nwhich was no doubt of the type described in _Lepidostrobus Brownii_,\r\nis represented by a gap in the sections, beyond which is the stronger\r\nouter cortex (fig. 191, D) passing into the horizontal pedicels of the\r\nsporophylls. The section of the axis reproduced in fig. 191, D, was\r\nfigured by Binney[423] as _Lepidodendron vasculare_. The leaf-traces,\r\nseveral of which are seen in the middle cortical region in fig. D,\r\n_lt_, consist of a strand of scalariform tracheae, with a mesarch\r\nprotoxylem, succeeded by a few parenchymatous cells; beyond these there\r\nis usually a small gap which was originally occupied by a strand of\r\nthin-walled cells. It is important to note that in one sporophyll-trace\r\nfigured by Maslen[424] there is a strand of thin-walled elongated\r\nelements abutting on the xylem, which he describes as phloem. This\r\ntissue is certainly more like true phloem than any which has hitherto\r\nbeen described in the leaf-traces of vegetative shoots. The state\r\nof preservation is not, however, sufficiently good to enable us to\r\nrecognise undoubted phloem features.\r\n\r\nIn such cones as I have examined no tissue has been seen which shows\r\nthe histological features characteristic of the secretory zone of\r\nvegetative shoots: the “phloem” (Maslen) occupies the position in\r\nthe sporophyll bundle which in the vascular bundles of foliage\r\nleaves is occupied by a dark-celled and partially disorganised\r\ntissue in continuity with the secretory zone of the main stele. It\r\nmay be that in the strobili this tissue occurred in a modified\r\nform, but even assuming that the section figured by Maslen shows\r\ntrue phloem, an assumption based on slender evidence, this is not\r\nsufficient justification for the application of the term phloem to a\r\ntissue occupying a corresponding position in vegetative shoots and\r\ndistinguished by well-marked histological features.\r\n\r\nThe sporophyll-traces, as seen in the outer cortex in fig. 191, D,\r\nare partially surrounded by a large crescentic space, _p_, which was\r\noriginally occupied by the parichnos. The sporangia are attached along\r\nthe middle line of the sporophyll and, as in _Lepidostrobus Brownii_,\r\na cushion of parenchyma projects into the lower part of the sporangial\r\ncavity (fig. 191, A, _a_; C, _a_).\r\n\r\nThe diagrammatic sketch of part of a section in the Binney Collection\r\nreproduced in fig. 191, B, shows the position of the ligule, _l_. No\r\nmegaspores have been discovered in any specimens of this type; the\r\nmicrospores, which occur both singly and in tetrads, have a length of\r\n0·02–0·03 mm.\r\n\r\nThe drawing shown in fig. 191, A, based on a section in the Binney\r\nCollection, illustrates the general arrangement of the parts of a\r\ntypical _Lepidostrobus_. I have made use of this sketch instead of that\r\ngiven by Maslen, as his figure conveys the idea that the sporophylls\r\nare superposed, whereas, whether they are verticillate or spiral, a\r\nradial longitudinal section would not cut successive sporangia in the\r\nsame plane.\r\n\r\n\r\niii. _Lepidostrobus Brownii_ (Brongn.).\r\n\r\nIn 1843 a specimen of a portion of a petrified cone was purchased by\r\nthe British Museum, assisted by the Marquis of Northampton and Robert\r\nBrown, for £30 from a French dealer. This fossil, from an unknown\r\nlocality, was briefly described by Brown in 1851[425] and named by him\r\n_Triplosporites_, but in a note added to his paper he expressed the\r\nopinion that the generic designation _Lepidostrobus_ would be more\r\nappropriate. Brongniart afterwards named the cone _Triplosporites_\r\n_Brownii_[426], and Schimper[427] described it in his _Traité_ as\r\n_Lepidostrobus Brownii_. The type-specimen is preserved in the British\r\nMuseum and the Paris Museum possesses a piece of the same fossil.\r\n\r\nThe central axis of the cone has a stele of the type characteristic\r\nof _Lepidodendron fuliginosum_ and _L. Harcourtii_, and the xylem\r\nis surrounded by a thin-walled tissue described by Bower[428] as\r\npossibly phloem; but in the absence of longitudinal sections it is\r\nimpossible to say how far the tissue external to the xylem agrees with\r\nthat in Lepidodendron stems. The sporophylls consist of a horizontal\r\nportion, to the upper face of which the radially elongated sporangia\r\nare attached, one to each sporophyll; beyond the distal end of the\r\nsporangium the sporophyll bends sharply upwards as a fairly stout\r\nlamina. The wall of the sporangium is composed of several layers of\r\ncells, as shown in a drawing published by Bower[429]; in the interior\r\noccur groups of microspores, and from a ridge of tissue which extends\r\nalong the whole length of the sporangium irregular trabeculae of\r\nsterile tissue project into the sporangial cavity, as in _Isoetes_\r\n(fig. 191, H: cf. fig. 133, H).\r\n\r\nFurther information in regard to _Lepidostrobus Brownii_ has recently\r\nbeen supplied by Prof. Zeiller[430], who recognises the existence of a\r\nligule, and draws attention to some interesting histological features\r\nin the tissue of the sporophylls[431].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spores of Palaeozoic Lycopodiales._\r\n\r\nThe calcareous nodules from the Coal seams of Yorkshire and Lancashire\r\nare rich in isolated spores, many of which are undoubtedly those of\r\n_Lepidostrobi_. Examples of spores were figured by Morris[432] in 1840,\r\nand their occurrence in coal has been described by several authors,\r\none of the earliest accounts being by Balfour[433]. The drawings of\r\nPalaeozoic and recent spores published by Kidston and Bennie[434]\r\ndemonstrate a striking similarity between the megaspores of existing\r\nand extinct Lycopods, the chief difference being the larger size of the\r\nfossils.\r\n\r\nThe general generic name _Triletes_, originally used by Reinsch[435],\r\nis a convenient term by which to designate Pteridophytic spores which\r\ncannot be referred to definite types.\r\n\r\nIt is usual to find more than four megaspores in each megasporangium\r\nin Palaeozoic and not infrequently, as we have seen, in Mesozoic\r\nlycopodiaceous strobili, but in some Palaeozoic cones, e.g.\r\n_Bothrostrobus_ (fig. 216) and _Lepidostrobus foliaceus_[436], a single\r\ntetrad only appears to have reached maturity.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of long simple or branched and sometimes capitate hairs\r\nis a common feature of Carboniferous megaspores (fig. 191, E, F, I).\r\nIt is possible that these appendages served to catch the microspores,\r\nthus facilitating fertilisation. A peculiar form of megaspore has\r\nbeen described by Mrs Scott[437], and assigned by her to _Lepidostrobus\r\nfoliaceus_, the megasporangium of which apparently contained only\r\nfour spores. As shown in fig. 191, G, a large bladder-like appendage\r\ncharacterised by radiating veins is attached to the thick spore-coat;\r\nit is suggested that this excrescence may be compared with the\r\n“swimming” apparatus of the recent water-fern _Azolla_. The epithet\r\nswimming which it is customary to apply to the appendages of _Azolla_\r\nmegaspores would seem to be inappropriate if Campbell[438] is correct in\r\nstating that spores of _Azolla_ are incapable of floating.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. _Spencerites._\r\n\r\n_Spencerites insignis_ (Williamson).

Trans. p. 83, Pls.\r\n        XII–XV.\r\n\r\nAnother type of lycopodiaceous strobilus, differing sufficiently from\r\n_Lepidostrobus_ to deserve a special generic designation, is that\r\noriginally described by Williamson[439], from the Lower Coal-Measures\r\nof Yorkshire, as a type of _Lepidostrobus_, _L. insignis_, but\r\nafterwards[440] more fully investigated and assigned to a new genus\r\nby Scott[441]. It should be pointed out that in a later publication\r\nWilliamson spoke of the lycopodiaceous axis, which he suspected might\r\nbelong to his _L. insignis_, as possibly worthy of recognition as a\r\ndistinct generic type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 192. _Spencerites insignis_ (Williamson). (After\r\n  Miss Berridge.)]\r\n\r\nOf the two species included by Scott in his genus _Spencerites_ only\r\none, _S. insignis_, need be considered. Since the publication of\r\nScott’s paper our knowledge of this type has been extended by Miss\r\nBerridge[442] and by Prof. Lang[443].\r\n\r\nThe axis of the strobilus has a stele characterised by a pith\r\nof elongated elements, most of which have thin walls; the xylem\r\ncylinder possesses about twenty protoxylem strands forming more or\r\nless prominent exarch ridges. The cortex exhibits a differentiation\r\ncomparable with that in the shoots of _Lepidodendron_. The sporophylls\r\nare arranged in alternating verticils, each whorl consisting of ten\r\nmembers: the narrow horizontal pedicel of a sporophyll, containing a\r\nsingle vascular bundle, as shown in fig. 192, is expanded distally\r\ninto a prominent upper lobe bearing a cushion of small and delicate\r\ncells, to which the sporangium is attached, and prolonged obliquely\r\nupwards as a free leaf-like lamina. The lower blunt prolongation of\r\nthe sporophylls appears to form a thick dorsal lobe, but, as Lang has\r\npointed out, it is highly probable that the present form of the dorsal\r\nlobe is of secondary origin, and is “due to the disappearance of a\r\nmucilage cavity from a large sporophyll base[444].” As Miss Berridge\r\nremarks, the vascular bundle of the sporophyll does not give off a\r\nbranch to the ventral lobe and sporangium. In attachment, in shape, and\r\nin the structure of the wall the sporangia differ markedly from those\r\nof _Lepidostrobi_. The spores, which also constitute a characteristic\r\nfeature of the genus, have a maximum diameter of 0·14 mm.; they are\r\ndescribed as oblate spheroids with a broad hollow wing running round\r\nthe equator (fig. 192) comparable with the air-sacs of the pollen\r\nof _Pinus_. Scott points out that the spores of _Spencerites_ are\r\nintermediate in size between the microspores of _Lepidodendron_ and\r\nthe megaspores of _Lycopodium_; it is difficult therefore to decide\r\nto which category they should be referred. _Spencerites_ is clearly\r\ndistinct from _Lepidostrobus_; the absence of a ligule, the manner of\r\nattachment of the sporangia, and the form and size of the spores, are\r\ncharacteristic features.\r\n\r\nA comparison of _Spencerites_ with the strobili of _Lycopodium cernuum_\r\n(figs. 123, 126–129) has recently been made by Lang, who draws\r\nattention to the striking agreement as regards general plan and even\r\ndetailed structural features between the Palaeozoic and the recent\r\ntype of strobilus. It is interesting to find, as Lang points out, that\r\nin the original account of the fossil cone by Williamson, the view\r\nis expressed that the sporangiophores were confluent. An examination\r\nof the section figured by Williamson[445] led Lang to confirm this\r\nopinion. It would be out of place to enter here into a detailed\r\ncomparison of _Spencerites insignis_ and the cone of _Lycopodium_,\r\nbut the resemblances are considered by Lang to be sufficiently\r\nclose to suggest that the striking similarity may be indicative of\r\nrelationship[446].\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of notice that the radial section of _Spencerites_ (fig.\r\n192) presents a fairly close resemblance to a corresponding section\r\nthrough a cone-scale of _Agathis_ (Kauri Pine)[447]. In each case the\r\nmegasporangium is attached by a narrow pedicel to the sporophyll and\r\nthe latter has a similar form in the two plants, though the extent of\r\nthe resemblance is somewhat lessened by Lang’s more complete account\r\nof the Palaeozoic type. If the _Spencerites_ sporangia possessed an\r\nintegument the similarity with the _Agathis_ ovule would of course be\r\nmuch closer: recent palaeobotanical investigations have shown that\r\novules and sporangia are not separated by impassable barriers.\r\n\r\n[Since this Chapter was set up in type a paper has appeared by Dr Bruno\r\nKubart on a new species of _Spencerites_ spore, _S. membranaceus_,\r\nfrom the Ostrau-Karwiner Coal-basin (Austria). The spores are larger\r\nthan those of _S. insignis_ and in some the cells of a prothallus are\r\npreserved. Kubart figures a section of a spore containing a group\r\nof seven cells, a central cell, which he regards as an antheridial\r\nmother-cell, surrounded by six wall-cells.

In\r\nexternal form as in internal structure the difference between the two\r\ngenera are not such as enable us to draw in all cases a clearly defined\r\nline of separation.\r\n\r\nIn the _Antediluvian Phytology_, Artis[448] figured a fossil from the\r\nCarboniferous sandstones of Yorkshire which he called _Euphorbites\r\nvulgaris_ on account of a superficial resemblance to the stems of\r\nexisting succulent Euphorbias. Rhode[449] also compared Sigillarian\r\nstems with those of recent _Cacti_. The specimen described by Artis\r\nis characterised by regular vertical and slightly convex ribs bearing\r\nrows of leaf-scars in spiral series, like those on the cushions of\r\n_Lepidodendron_. A few years earlier Brongniart[450] had instituted the\r\ngenus _Sigillaria_[451] for plants with ribbed but not jointed stems\r\nbearing “disc-like impressions” (leaf-scars) disposed in quincunx; the\r\ntype-species named by the author of the genus _Sigillaria scutellata_\r\nis identical, as Kidston[452] points out, with _Euphorbites vulgaris_\r\nof Artis and with the plant afterwards figured by Brongniart as _S.\r\npachyderma_[453]. Brongniart in 1822 figured another type of stem\r\ncharacterised by the absence of ribs and by prominent spirally arranged\r\ncushions bearing relatively large leaf-scars like the upper part of\r\nthe specimen shown in fig. 203; this he named _Clathraria Brardii_, a\r\nwell-known and widely distributed Carboniferous and Permian species\r\nnow spoken of as _Sigillaria Brardi_ (figs. 196, A–C; 203). A third\r\ntype of stem figured by Brongniart as _Syringodendron striatum_[454]\r\nagrees with _Sigillaria scutellata_ in having ribs, but differs in the\r\nsubstitution of narrow oval ridges or depressions for leaf-scars; this\r\nis now recognised as a partially decorticated _Sigillaria_, in which\r\nthe vascular bundle of each leaf is represented by a narrow ridge or\r\ndepression. The name _Syringodendron_, originally used by Sternberg, is\r\nconveniently applied to certain forms of Sigillarian stems which have\r\nlost their superficial tissues. A fourth generic name, _Favularia_, was\r\ninstituted by Sternberg[455] for Sigillarian stems with ribs covered\r\nwith contiguous leaf-scars of hexagonal form and prominent lateral\r\nangles (fig. 193, A; fig. 200, G).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 193.\r\n\r\n  A. _Sigillaria elegans_ Brongn.\r\n  B. _Sigillaria rugosa_ Brongn.

Dr Kidston’s Collection.)]\r\n\r\nThe generic or sub-generic title _Rhytidolepis_, also instituted\r\nby Sternberg, is applied to ribbed Sigillarian stems such as _S.\r\nscutellata_, _S. rugosa_ (fig. 193, B), _S. mammillaris_ (fig. 195),\r\nor _S. laevigata_ (fig. 196, D). Goldenberg[456] proposed the name\r\n_Leiodermaria_ for smooth Sigillarian stems with leaf-scars not in\r\ncontact with one another (fig. 196, C).\r\n\r\nThe shoot system of _Sigillaria_ consisted of a stout stem tapering\r\nupwards to a height of 100 feet[457] or more as an unbranched column,\r\nwith its dome-shaped apex[458] covered with linear grass-like\r\nleaves or, in some species, such as _Sigillaria Brardi_[459], _S.\r\nEugenii_[460], etc., the main trunk was occasionally divided by\r\napparently equal dichotomy. The younger portions of the stem or\r\nbranches were in some species clothed with leaves separated by a narrow\r\nzigzag groove surrounding their hexagonal bases, while in other\r\nforms each leaf was seated on a more or less prominent cushion having\r\nthe form illustrated by _Sigillaria McMurtriei_ (fig. 194) or by the\r\nexample represented in fig. 200, H; or as in the ribbed species shown\r\nin figs. 193, B, and 195, the leaves in vertical series were separated\r\nfrom one another by longer portions of the ribs. As in _Lepidodendron_\r\nthe cushions are frequently characterised by irregular transverse\r\nwrinklings and other[461] surface-ornamentation which in some instances\r\nat least may have been produced as the result of _post-mortem_\r\nshrinkage of superficial tissue. From the rarity of shoots with the\r\nfoliage attached, it would seem that the leaves persisted for a\r\ncomparatively short time and were cut off by an absciss-layer leaving\r\nbehind a well-marked leaf-scar area. The linear leaves, reaching in\r\nrare cases a length of one metre (e.g. _S. lepidodendrifolia_) but\r\nusually much shorter, possessed a single median bundle, and the lower\r\nface was characterised by two stomatal grooves and a median keel. It is\r\nnot uncommon to find leaf-bases of _Sigillaria_ detached from the stem\r\nand preserved as separate impressions. The term _Sigillariophyllum_\r\nused by Grand’Eury[462] may be applied to detached leaves, though it\r\nis by no means easy to distinguish between the foliage of _Sigillaria_\r\nand _Lepidodendron_. A comparison of a typical species of _Sigillaria_,\r\nsuch as _S. rugosa_ (fig. 193, B) or _S. Brardi_ (fig. 196, A–C) with\r\na typical _Lepidodendron_ reveals obvious differences in the form of\r\nthe leaf-cushion, but in some cases the distinction becomes purely\r\narbitrary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 194. _Sigillaria McMurtriei_ Kidst.

Brardi_), some\r\ncircular scars with a central pit surrounded by a raised rim occur\r\non the surface of the stem, either singly or in pairs, near the\r\nleaf-scars; these, it is suggested, may represent the position of\r\nadventitious roots or, as Germar thought, of some deciduous spinous\r\nprocesses. The leaf-scars are frequently hexagonal in shape, with the\r\nlateral angles either rounded (fig. 200, F) or sharply pointed (fig.\r\n200, G, H); each scar bears three smaller scars as in _Lepidodendron_,\r\na central circular, oval or crescentic leaf-trace scar and larger oval\r\nor slightly curved scars formed by the two parichnos arms (fig. 195,\r\n_p_). The larger size of the parichnos arms, the individual cells of\r\nwhich may often be detected as a fine punctation, is a distinguishing\r\nfeature of the genus, but otherwise the structure is very similar to\r\nthat in _Lepidodendron_. As shown in figs. 195, 200, F, G, the three\r\nscars may occur nearer the upper than the lower margin of the leaf-base\r\narea.\r\n\r\n_Lepidodendron Wortheni_[464] (fig. 196, E), described from North\r\nAmerica by Lesquereux[465], by Zeiller[466] from France, and by\r\nKidston[467] from the Upper and Middle Coal-Measures of England,\r\nmay be quoted as a _Lepidodendron_ bearing a close resemblance to\r\n_Sigillaria_. The shoots bear cushions two or three times as long\r\nas broad and without the usual median division, but with numerous\r\nirregular and discontinuous transverse wrinklings. _Lepidodendron\r\nPeachii_ Kidston[468] affords another example of a form agreeing both\r\nwith _Sigillaria_ and with _Lepidodendron_. An Upper Devonian type\r\ndescribed by White[469] as _Archaeosigillaria primaeva_ affords a\r\nstriking instance of the combination on one stem of Sigillarian and\r\nLepidodendroid leaf-cushions.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the original surface of a Sigillaria stem and\r\nthat of partially decorticated specimens is seen in figs. 196, C and\r\nD; in fig. C the bark of _Sigillaria Brardi_ shows the characteristic\r\nwrinklings of the superficial tissue, while at a slightly lower level\r\nthe leaf-scars are replaced by the parichnos casts, a, and fine\r\nlongitudinal striations represent the elongated phelloderm cells laid\r\nbare by the exfoliation of the surface-layers. Similarly, in the rib\r\nof _Sigillaria laevigata_ (fig. 196, D) the parichnos arms, _p_, and\r\nthe longitudinal striations are exposed at the lower level, while the\r\nsurface is smooth and bears rows of widely separated leaf-scars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 197. _Carica sp._ From the Royal Gardens, Kew.\r\n  (Much reduced.) M.S.]\r\n\r\nThe older part of a Sigillarian stem may present an appearance very\r\ndifferent from that of the younger shoots. The leaf-cushions may be\r\nstretched apart as the result of elongation and increase in girth,\r\nwhile in some cases the arrangement of the leaf-scars may vary on the\r\nsame axis as the result of inequalities in growth or changing climatic\r\nconditions. The contiguous arrangement of the leaf-scars and narrow\r\ncushions characteristic of the Clathrarian form of stem, as was first\r\ndemonstrated by Weiss[470], and afterwards illustrated by Zeiller[471]\r\nand Kidston, may be gradually replaced (on the same specimen) by a more\r\ndistant disposition of the leaf-scars separated by a smooth intervening\r\nsurface of bark. The specimen of _S. Brardi_ reproduced in part in\r\nfig. 203, and first figured by Kidston, affords an example of three\r\n“species” on one piece of stem, _S. Brardi_ Brongn., _S. denudata_\r\nGoepp. and _S. rhomboidea_ Brongn.[472]\r\n\r\nThe piece of _Carica_ stem, represented in fig. 197, illustrates the\r\ndanger of trusting to the disposition of leaves as a specific criterion.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in the ribbed forms the degree of separation of the\r\nleaf-scars is by no means uniform in a single species[473]. Some\r\nauthors have adopted a two-fold classification of Sigillarian stems\r\nproposed by the late Prof. Weiss[474] of Berlin, who divided the\r\nSigillariae into (A) Sub-Sigillariae, comprising Leiodermariae and\r\nCancellatae, and (B) Eu-Sigillariae, including _Favulariae_ and\r\n_Rhytidolepis_. Grand’Eury[475] adopts the terms _Rhytidolepis_ and\r\n_Leiodermaria_ for ribbed and smooth stems respectively, the type to\r\nwhich the name _Clathraria_ was applied by Brongniart being in some\r\ncases at least the young form of Leiodermarian stems. While recognising\r\nthe artificial distinction implied by such terms as _Rhytidolepis_,\r\n_Leiodermaria_, and other sub-generic titles, we may conveniently speak\r\nof the two main types of _Sigillaria_ stems as ribbed and smooth.\r\n\r\nStill older stems of _Sigillaria_ are not uncommon from which the\r\nleaf-scars and other superficial tissues have been exfoliated,\r\nleaving exposed a longitudinally fissured surface of secondary cortex\r\ncharacterised by pairs of considerably enlarged parichnos strands\r\n(fig. 198) which are sometimes partially or wholly fused into one\r\n(_Syringodendron_ state of _Sigillaria_). The single or double nature\r\nof the elliptical or circular parichnos areas is doubtless due to the\r\ndegree of exfoliation, which may extend sufficiently deep into the\r\ncortex to reach the level of the parichnos before the single strand has\r\nbifurcated (cf. _Lepidodendron_, p. 100). In the Museums of Manchester,\r\nNewcastle, and other places casts of large Sigillaria stems may be\r\nseen, which illustrate the differences in breadth and regularity of\r\nthe vertical ribs, and in the size and shape of the parichnos areas\r\nin different regions of a partially decorticated stem. A cast of a\r\nribbed species in the Manchester Museum, having a length of 185 cm.\r\nand a breadth of 56 cm., shows in the upper portion straight vertical\r\ngrooves and broad ribs bearing pairs of parichnos scars 11 mm. long;\r\nin the lower portion the ribs tend to become obliterated and the\r\nparichnos scars, 2 cm. in length, may be partially fused and arranged\r\nin much less regular vertical series. A feature of these older ribbed\r\nSigillarian stems is the increase in the number of the ribs from below\r\nupwards. Kidston[476] has described a specimen in the Sunderland\r\nMuseum, 6 feet 6 inches long, with a circumference at the slightly\r\nbottle-shaped base of 5 feet. On the lower portion of the stem there\r\nare 29 broad ribs; about one-third the height many of these bifurcate,\r\nproducing as many as 40 ribs in the upper part where the cast has a\r\ncircumference of 3 feet. The increase in number of the ribs is due in\r\npart to bifurcation, but also to the intercalation of new ones. As\r\nKidston points out, this example shows that as a stem grew in length\r\nadditional leaves were developed at the apex. A similar stem, which\r\nillustrates very clearly the increase in the number of ribs from below\r\nupwards, may be seen in the Newcastle Museum.\r\n\r\nGrand’Eury[477] has described an example of an old stem of a ribless\r\nspecies of _Sigillaria_, _Syringodendron bioculatum_, bearing single\r\nand double parichnos areas of nearly circular form and with a\r\ndiameter of 1–2 cm. In a specimen figured by Renault and Roche[478]\r\n(_Syringodendron esnostense_) from the Culm strata in France, the\r\nparichnos scars reach a length of 3 cm. As seen in the fragment of a\r\nribbed _Sigillaria_ represented in fig. 198, the large parichnos areas\r\nexhibit a distinct surface pitting in contrast to the fine longitudinal\r\nstriation of the rib; the difference in surface-appearance is due to\r\nthe nature of the tissue, which in the parichnos consists of fairly\r\nlarge parenchymatous elements with groups of secretory cells[479], and\r\nin the exposed cortex of elongated elements. The vertical line in the\r\nmiddle of fig. 198, which occurs in the middle of the rib, has probably\r\nbeen formed by splitting of the bark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 198. _Sigillaria_ with large parichnos areas. (⅓\r\n  nat. size.) M.S.]\r\n\r\nGrand’Eury’s description of fossil forests of Sigillariae in the\r\nrocks of the St Étienne[480] district affords a striking picture of\r\nthese arborescent Pteridophytes; he speaks of the stems of some of\r\nthe trees as swollen like a bottle at the base, characterised by the\r\nSyringodendron features and terminating below in short repeatedly\r\nforked roots of the type known as _Stigmariopsis_. Other specimens\r\nof _Sigillaria_ stumps show a marked decrease in girth towards the\r\nbase; this tapered form is regarded by Grand’Eury as the result of the\r\ndevelopment of aerial columnar stems from underground rhizomes.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the root-like organs of _Sigillaria_ is dealt with in the\r\nsequel: a brief reference may, however, be made to the occurrence of\r\nstumps of vertical trunks which pass downwards into regularly forked\r\nand spreading arms. These arms lie almost horizontally in the sand or\r\nmud like the underground rhizomes of _Phragmites_ and other recent\r\nplants growing in swampy situations where water is abundant and where\r\ndeeper penetration of the soil would expose them to an insufficient\r\nsupply of oxygen[481]. It is certain that _Sigillaria_ had no tap-root,\r\nbut was supported on spreading subterranean organs bearing spirally\r\ndisposed long and slender rootlets which absorbed water from a swampy\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 199. Partially decorticated stem of _Sigillaria_\r\n  showing two zones of cone-scars. From a cast in the Sedgwick\r\n  Museum, Cambridge. M.S. (⅕ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nThe regularity of the leaf-scar series on a Sigillarian stem may be\r\ninterrupted by the occurrence of oval scars with a central scar and\r\nsurrounding groove (fig. 193, E); these occur in zones at more or less\r\nregular intervals on the stem, as seen in the partially decorticated\r\ncast represented in fig. 199. Zeiller has pointed out that the rows of\r\noval or circular scars, which mark the position of caducous stalked\r\nstrobili, may occur between the leaf-scars in vertical series, each of\r\nwhich may include as many as 20 scars, while in other cases a single\r\nseries of such cone-scars may encircle the stem[482]. The zones are\r\nusually of uneven breadth, as in _S. Brardi_, and their occurrence\r\nproduces some deformation of the adjacent leaf-scars.\r\n\r\nBy the earlier writers _Sigillaria_ was compared with succulent\r\nEuphorbias, Cacti, and Palms; Brongniart[483] at first included\r\nundoubted Sigillarian stems among Ferns, but after investigating\r\nan agatized stem from Autun, he referred _Sigillaria_ to the\r\nGymnosperms[484] on the ground that it had the power of producing\r\nsecondary wood. It was then supposed that _Lepidodendron_ possessed\r\nonly primary xylem, and that the presence of a vascular meristem in\r\n_Sigillaria_ necessitated its separation from the lycopodiaceous genus\r\n_Lepidodendron_ and its inclusion in the higher plants. By slow degrees\r\nit was recognised, as in the parallel case of the genus _Calamites_,\r\nthat the presence or absence of secondary vascular tissue is a\r\ncharacter of small importance. Williamson, whose anatomical researches\r\nplayed the most important part in ridding the minds of palaeobotanists\r\nof the superstition that secondary growth in thickness is a monopoly\r\nof the Phanerogams, spoke in 1883 of the conflict as to the affinities\r\nof _Lepidodendron_ and _Sigillaria_ as virtually over but leaving\r\nhere and there “the ground-swell of a stormy past[485].” In 1872\r\nthe same author had written: “If then I am correct in thus bringing\r\nthe Lepidodendra and Sigillariae into such close affinity, there is\r\nan end of M. Brongniart’s theory, that the latter were gymnospermous\r\nexogens, because the cryptogamic character of the former is disputed by\r\nno one; we must rather conclude as I have done that the entire series\r\nrepresents, along with the Calamites, an exogenous group of Cryptogams\r\nin which the woody zone separated a medullary from a cortical\r\nportion[486].”\r\n\r\nIn 1879 Renault[487] expressed the opinion that Brongniart by his\r\ninvestigation of the anatomy of _Sigillaria elegans_ had established in\r\na manner “presque irréfutable” that _Sigillaria_ must be classed as a\r\nGymnosperm showing affinity with the Cycads.\r\n\r\nIn 1855 Goldenberg[488] described some strobili which he regarded as\r\nthose of _Sigillaria_ and recognised their close resemblance to a\r\nfertile plant of _Isoetes_. He was led to the conclusion, which had\r\nlittle influence on contemporary opinion, that _Sigillaria_ is related\r\nto _Isoetes_ and must be classed among Pteridophytes. To these long\r\nand narrow strobili Schimper gave the name _Sigillariostrobus_[489].\r\nIn 1884 Zeiller[490] supplied confirmation of Goldenberg’s view by\r\nthe discovery of cones borne on pedicels with Sigillarian leaf-scars,\r\nthus demonstrating the generic identity of cones and vegetative\r\nshoots, which Goldenberg had connected on the evidence of association.\r\nZeiller’s more recent work[491] and the still later researches of\r\nKidston[492] have added considerably to our knowledge of the morphology\r\nof Sigillarian cones. Grand’Eury’s remark made so recently as 1890[493]\r\nthat opinion in regard to the Gymnospermous nature of _Sigillaria_ is\r\nlosing ground every day, bears striking testimony to the pertinacity\r\nwith which old beliefs linger even in the face of overwhelming proof of\r\ntheir falsity.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, in view of the abundance of vegetative shoots,\r\nhow rarely undoubted Sigillarian strobili have been found; this\r\nmay, however, be in part due to a confusion with Lepidostrobi\r\nwhich so far as we know do not differ in important respects from\r\nSigillariostrobi[494].\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that _Sigillaria_ usually produced its cones\r\non slender pedicels which bore a few leaves or bracts in irregular\r\nverticils, or in short vertical series on comparatively stout stems, an\r\narrangement reminding us of the occurrence of flowers on old stems of\r\n_Theobroma_ and other recent Dicotyledons. As Renault[495] pointed out\r\nthe fertile shoots are axillary in origin.\r\n\r\nDr Kidston[496] is of opinion that certain species of _Sigillaria_\r\nbore cones sessile on large vegetative shoots characterised by two\r\nopposite rows of cup-like depressions like those in the Ulodendron\r\nform of _Lepidodendron Veltheimianum_ (fig. 157). He has described\r\nthe Ulodendron condition of two species, _Sigillaria discophora_\r\n(König) and _S. Taylori_ (Carr.); the cup-like depressions may have a\r\ndiameter of several centimetres and are distinguished from those of\r\n_Bothrodendron_ by the almost central position of the umbilicus. The\r\nspecimens which he figures as _S. discophora_ are identified by him\r\nwith the stem figured by König as _Lepidodendron discophorum_ and by\r\nLindley and Hutton[497] as _Ulodendron minus_. We have already dealt\r\nwith the nature of Ulodendron shoots, expressing the opinion that in\r\nspite of the often quoted specimen described by D’Arcy Thompson[498],\r\nin which a supposed cone occurs in one of the cups, there is no\r\nsatisfactory case of any undoubted cone having been found attached to\r\nthe large Ulodendron scars. It is more probable that the Ulodendron\r\ndepressions represent the scars of branches, either elongated axes,\r\nor possibly in some cases deciduous tuberous shoots which served as\r\norgans of vegetative reproduction. A specimen figured by Kidston as\r\n_Sigillaria Taylori_ from the Calciferous sandstone of Scotland[499]\r\nbears a row of slightly projecting “appendicular organs” attached to a\r\nUlodendron axis; but these furnish no proof of their strobiloid nature.\r\nThe main question is, are these Ulodendron shoots correctly identified\r\nby Kidston as Sigillarian? The surface of the specimens shows crowded\r\nrhomboidal scars surrounded in some cases by a very narrow border\r\nor cushion; the general appearance is, as Kidston maintains, like\r\nthat of _Sigillaria Brardi_ in which the leaf-scars are contiguous\r\n(e.g. fig. 203, upper part). None of the leaf-scars exhibit the three\r\ncharacteristic features, the leaf-trace and parichnos scars, but only\r\none small scar appears on each leaf-base area. In a more recent paper\r\nKidston figures a small piece of a stem from Kilmarnock, which he\r\nidentifies as _Sigillaria discophora_, showing the three characteristic\r\nscars on the leaf-base area. There is no doubt as to the Sigillarian\r\nnature of this specimen, but it is not clear if the piece figured is\r\npart of a Ulodendron shoot[500].\r\n\r\nProf. Zeiller[501] retains the older name _Ulodendron minus_ Lind.\r\nand Hutt. in place of König’s specific designation and dissents\r\nfrom Kidston’s identification of _Ulodendron minus_ and _U. majus_\r\nof Lindley and Hutton as one species; he is also inclined to refer\r\nthese Ulodendron axes to _Lepidodendron_. In spite of the superficial\r\nresemblance to _Sigillaria_ of the specimens described by Kidston,\r\nand which I have had an opportunity of examining, I venture to regard\r\ntheir reference to that genus as by no means definitely established.\r\nWe must recognise the difficulty in certain cases of drawing any\r\nsatisfactory distinction between _Sigillaria_ and _Lepidodendron_ based\r\non external features, and while giving due weight to the conclusions\r\nof so experienced a palaeobotanist as my friend Dr Kidston, I venture\r\nto think we are not in a position to state with confidence that\r\n_Sigillaria_ possessed Ulodendron shoots.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ii. _Leaves._\r\n\r\nThe leaves of _Sigillaria_ agree closely with those of _Lepidodendron_;\r\nthey are either acicular (fig. 200, D) like Pine needles or broader\r\nand flatter like the leaves of _Podocarpus_. Their attachment to\r\ncomparatively thick branches[502] shows that they persisted, in some\r\ncases at least, for several years as in _Araucaria imbricata_. The\r\nlower surface of the lamina was characterised by a prominent keel (fig.\r\n142, A and C) which dies out towards the apex; on either side of it\r\nare well-defined stomatal grooves (figs. 142, _g_, _g_; 143, A; 200,\r\nD, _g_). The upper face may be characterised by another groove (fig.\r\n142, B) but without stomata. The occurrence of the stomatal grooves,\r\nthe abundance of transfusion tracheae (fig. 142, _t_) surrounding\r\nthe vascular bundle, and the presence of strengthening hypodermal\r\ntissue suggest that the leaves of _Sigillaria_ were of a more or less\r\npronounced xerophilous type and had a fairly strong and leathery\r\nlamina. The mesophyll tissue consists either of short parenchymatous\r\ncells or of radially elongated palisade-like elements and has the\r\nloose or lacunar arrangement characteristic of the aerating system in\r\nrecent leaves; the slight development or absence of palisade-tissue may\r\nindicate exposure to diffuse light of no great intensity.\r\n\r\nIn most species there is a single vein, but in others the xylem forms\r\na double strand (fig. 142, B). Sections of the lamina near the apical\r\nregion present a more circular form, owing to the gradual obliteration\r\nof the upper groove and lower keel and to the dying out of the stomatal\r\ngrooves.\r\n\r\nThe transverse section of the leaf diagrammatically represented in\r\nfig. 142, A, A′, shows the two stomatal grooves, _g_, and a prominent\r\nkeel; the single vein consists of a small group of primary tracheae,\r\n_x_, some delicate parenchyma, and a brown patch of imperfectly\r\npreserved tissues, _a_, resembling the secretory zone tissue of a\r\n_Lepidodendron_. The whole is surrounded by a sheath of rather wide\r\nand short thinner-walled spiral or reticulate tracheids, which may\r\nbe spoken of as transfusion tracheae, _t_, and compared with similar\r\nelements in the leaves of many recent Conifers. To this tissue Renault\r\napplies the epithet “water-bearing” and it is very likely that this\r\nmay have been its function. The shaded portions of the lamina, in fig.\r\n142, A, represent the distribution of thicker-walled hypodermal tissue.\r\nThe section of a leaf 3 mm. wide shown in fig. 142, C, shows an almost\r\nidentical structure; the transfusion tracheae are richly developed\r\nespecially on the sides and lower surface of the vascular strand.\r\nThis leaf occurs in association with a petrified stem of _Sigillaria\r\nscutellata_[503].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 200.\r\n\r\n  A. _Sigillaria Brardi_ [= _S. elegans_ Brongn.

(After Weiss.)]\r\n\r\nRenault[504] has shown that the leaf-traces of _Sigillaria spinulosa_\r\n(= _S. Brardi_) are accompanied in the outer cortical region of the\r\nstem by a fairly large amount of secondary xylem; in sections of the\r\nfree lamina which he figures the secondary elements are much less\r\nobvious and represented by a few tracheae only. Similarly, in the\r\nleaf-base of _S. Brardi_ (fig. 200, E) the xylem consists of both\r\nprimary and secondary elements (_x_, _x_²), but in the lamina the\r\nlatter is poorly if at all represented. In the lamina of the leaves\r\nof _S. Brardi_ the primary xylem forms a narrow slightly curved band\r\nwith two lateral groups of narrower, presumably protoxylem elements;\r\nthis is surrounded by delicate parenchyma styled by Renault, on very\r\nslender evidence, phloem (“liber”). Some dark cells below the xylem are\r\ndescribed as sclerous tissue, and surrounding the bundle is a sheath of\r\ntransfusion tracheae (dotted area in fig. 200, E). It is possible that\r\nthe elements spoken of with hesitation by Renault as secondary xylem\r\nare transfusion tracheae.\r\n\r\nThere has probably been some confusion in the minds of authors between\r\nsclerous tissue and dark secretory tissue in Sigillarian leaves; the\r\ncrescentic band, _a_, shown in fig. 142, B, which corresponds in\r\nposition with the sclerous tissue of Renault in _S. Brardi_ leaves,\r\nappears to be of the nature of secretory tissue.\r\n\r\nThe diagram shown in fig. 142, B, illustrates a type of leaf very like\r\nthose already described, except that there are two xylem strands, _x_.\r\nThe difference between the double strand and the single bundle seen in\r\nfigs. 142, A, C and 200 E, is comparatively small, but it is a real\r\ndistinction. This type of leaf (fig. 142, B) was originally described\r\nby Renault[505] under the generic title _Sigillariopsis_. The genus was\r\nfounded on a French petrified specimen consisting of part of a ribbed\r\nstem possessing a stele of the Sigillarian type and characterised by\r\nseparate primary xylem strands, like those of _S. Brardi_ described\r\nby Brongniart in 1839. Renault considered the presence of two xylem\r\nstrands in the leaf a sufficient reason for the institution of a new\r\ngenus and named the specimen _Sigillariopsis Decaisnei_. Prof. Bertrand\r\nof Lille kindly photographed for me Renault’s type-specimen and sent\r\nseveral prints with explanatory notes. The transverse section of the\r\nleaves shows very clearly the two xylem strands; each strand consists\r\nof a triangular group of primary tracheae with the protoxylem apex\r\npointing towards the lower surface of the lamina. Below each primary\r\nstrand of centripetal xylem is an arc composed of a few small tracheae\r\nwhich Renault and Bertrand describe as secondary xylem; it is, however,\r\nnot clear from the photomicrographs that these are of secondary origin,\r\ntheir position and appearance reminding one of the primary centrifugal\r\nxylem of a cycadean foliar bundle. Below this centrifugal xylem is\r\nanother arc of imperfectly preserved elements described by Renault as a\r\nprotective sheath and by Bertrand as glandular tissue; the latter term\r\nis probably the more correct as the tissue may well correspond to the\r\nsecretory-zone tissue of Lepidodendron stems. Fairly large groups of\r\ntransfusion tracheids occur on the flanks of the xylem. Prof. Bertrand\r\npoints out that one of his sections, cut nearer the apex of a leaf than\r\nthat figured by Renault with a single xylem strand, contains a double\r\nstrand and thus shows the latter’s description to be an incorrect\r\ninterpretation of the imperfectly preserved tissues.\r\n\r\nThe _Sigillariopsis_ type of leaf was recognised by Scott[506] in\r\nEnglish material on which he founded the species _Sigillariopsis\r\nsulcata_. In a section which he has recently figured[507] a lacuna\r\nbelow the two xylem strands is described as “representing secretory\r\ntissue”; a band of transfusion tracheae almost encircles the pair of\r\nbundles.\r\n\r\nIn a note published in 1907, Kidston[508] demonstrated the association\r\nof _Sigillariopsis_ leaves with an undoubted Sigillarian stem of the\r\nRhytidolepis type and expressed his conviction that Renault’s genus is\r\nidentical with _Sigillaria_. The correctness of Kidston’s conclusion\r\nhas been proved by Arber and Thomas[509] who found that the leaf-traces\r\nof _Sigillaria scutellata_ bifurcate during their course through the\r\nouter region of the cortex and enter the leaf as two distinct strands\r\nof primary xylem. In the section from Dr Kidston’s collection shown in\r\nfig. 142, B, the lamina, 4 mm. wide, consists mainly of thin-walled\r\nassimilating tissue composed of radially elongated cells abutting at\r\nthe periphery on hypodermal mechanical tissue, except at the edges of\r\nthe stomatal grooves which are bounded by the small-celled epidermis.\r\nA broad sheath of thicker-walled elements, _s_, surrounds numerous\r\nscattered transfusion tracheae, _t_, and below the two xylem strands,\r\n_x_, which are embedded in delicate parenchyma there is a crescentic\r\nband of dark tissue, _a_, resembling the smaller strand, _a_, in fig.\r\n142, A′, and the secretory zone tissue of a Lepidodendron stem.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 iii. _Fertile shoots of_ Sigillaria.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the manner of occurrence of strobili\r\non Sigillarian stems; it remains to describe the structure of these\r\nreproductive shoots. _Sigillariostrobus_, the name given to Sigillarian\r\nstrobili, may be defined in general terms as follows:\r\n\r\nCylindrical cones, rarely dichotomously branched[510] as in species\r\nof _Lycopodium_ and _Selaginella_, which may reach a length of 30 cm.\r\n(_e.g._ _Sigillariostrobus nobilis_ Zeill.[511]) and a diameter 2–5\r\ncm.; peduncle long and slender, sometimes bearing acicular bracts or,\r\nafter leaf-fall, characterised by leaf-cushions and leaf-scars like\r\nthose on vegetative shoots (fig. 201, E). The stalked cones are borne\r\nin irregular verticils and in some species in vertical series, the\r\nfertile zones being separated by comparatively long sterile portions\r\nof the stem (fig. 199). The cones were deciduous and, in certain cases\r\nif not in all, the individual sporophylls became detached from the\r\ncone-axis on maturity. The slender axis bore spiral or verticillate\r\nimbricate sporophylls attached at right angles or more or less\r\nobliquely. The basal rhomboidal portion bore spores on its upper\r\nsurface (fig. 201, F), presumably enclosed in a somewhat radially\r\nelongated sporangium (fig. B) and was prolonged distally into a narrow\r\nlanceolate free portion, in some species with a ciliate border (fig.\r\nD). The sporangia probably produced megaspores and microspores, but\r\nsuch spores as have been recognised appear to belong to the former\r\ncategory. The designation _Triletes_ is applied to isolated spores of\r\n_Sigillaria_ or to those of _Lepidodendron_.\r\n\r\n_Sigillariostrobus Tieghemi_ Zeiller[512] (figs. 201, E, F). In\r\nthis species, from the Coal-field of Valenciennes, the pedicel\r\nbore acicular leaves or bracts attached to the upper portion of\r\nleaf-cushions arranged in vertical series (fig. E). The cones reached a\r\nlength of 16 cm. and a breadth of 2·5–5 cm.; the sporophylls are borne\r\nin alternating verticils with 8–10 in each whorl. Several megaspores\r\n(2 mm. in diameter) appear to have been produced in tetrads in each\r\nsporangium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 201. _Sigillariostrobus._\r\n\r\n  A, C. _Sigillariostrobus rhombibracteatus_ Kidst.

(After Zeiller.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sigillariostrobus rhombibracteatus_ Kidston[513]. Fig. 201, A, C.\r\n\r\nKidston described this species from the Middle Coal-Measures of\r\nEngland: it is similar in habit and in the form of the sporophylls\r\nto _S. Tieghemi_, but rather smaller, and the more definitely\r\nrhomboidal sporophylls have a ciliate margin. The cone was probably\r\nheterosporous, but megaspores alone have so far been discovered. The\r\nsporophylls bear a close resemblance to those of _Lycopodium cernuum_\r\n(fig. 126, C). In some of the illustrations of this type given by\r\nKidston the naked cone-axis with its numerous sporophyll-scars is\r\nclearly shown, reminding one of the naked axes of the cones of the\r\nSilver Fir (_Abies pectinata_) or Cedar after the fall of the scales.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of Sigillarian cones is too incomplete to admit of a\r\ndetailed comparison with the strobili of _Lepidodendron_ or with those\r\nof recent Pteridophytes. There can, however, be little doubt that\r\nGoldenberg[514] was correct in his selection of _Isoetes_ as the most\r\nnearly allied recent plant so far as the fertile leaves are concerned.\r\nIt would seem that the sporangia were comparatively delicate structures\r\nwhich have left no clearly defined remains of their walls in the\r\ncarbonised specimens; Kidston, indeed, speaks of the hollow bases of\r\nthe sporophylls as holding the spores, but this is hardly likely to\r\nhave been the case. Our knowledge of the anatomy of _Sigillariostrobus_\r\nis practically nil, but in one specimen of a _Sigillaria elegans_\r\nstem Kidston[515] describes the structure of the tissues as seen\r\nin a transverse section of a scar of a fertile shoot; from this we\r\nlearn that the stele was composed exclusively of primary tracheids\r\nforming a solid strand without a pith. It is probable that the cones\r\nof _Sigillaria_ were heterosporous, but in no instance have undoubted\r\nmicrospores been discovered; the megaspores in each megasporangium\r\nwere fairly numerous as in _Isoetes_ (fig. 133, E). In one species,\r\n_Sigillariostrobus major_ (Germar), from Permian rocks of France and\r\nGermany, Zeiller[516] states that the whole of a single cone bore\r\nmegaspores (0·8–1 mm. in diameter) only; this is, however, not opposed\r\nto the idea of heterospory, as we find instances in _Selaginella_ of\r\nstrobili bearing one kind of spore only (cf. p. 56).\r\n\r\nIn a few instances, it has been possible to correlate cones with\r\ncertain species of _Sigillaria_, but in most cases the strobili occur\r\nas isolated fossils.\r\n\r\n\r\n               iv. _The structure of Sigillarian stems._\r\n\r\nThe first account of the anatomy of _Sigillaria_ we owe to\r\nBrongniart[517] who published a description of the internal structure\r\nof an agatised stem, about 4 cm. in diameter, from Autun, which he\r\nreferred to _Sigillaria elegans_. It has, however, been shown by\r\nZeiller[518] and by Renault that this petrified fragment belongs to\r\nBrongniart’s species _S. Menardi_, which is probably a young form of\r\n_S. Brardi_. Brongniart’s specimen, now preserved in the Paris Natural\r\nHistory Museum, is a very beautiful example of a silicified plant: on\r\npart of the surface are preserved the hexagonal contiguous leaf-scars,\r\nlike those shown in fig. 193, A, and on the polished transverse section\r\nis seen a relatively large stele consisting of a ring of secondary\r\nxylem surrounding a series of crescentic groups of primary xylem (fig.\r\n200, A) enclosing a wide pith occupied by concentric layers of silica.\r\nA portion of the outer cortex is preserved, and this is separated\r\nfrom the stele by a broad space filled with siliceous rock. The main\r\nfeatures of this type may be described in a few words. The primary\r\nxylem differs from that of such Lepidodendron stems as have been\r\ndescribed in being made up of groups of scalariform and occasionally\r\nreticulate (fig. 200, C) tracheae, having a plano-convex or more or\r\nless crescentic form as seen in transverse section. These primary\r\nstrands, in contact with one another laterally, have their narrowest\r\nelements on the outer edge. The leaf-traces are given off from the\r\nmiddle of the abaxial face of each xylem strand (fig. 202, C, _lt_);\r\nthese pass obliquely outwards through medullary rays and then, as in\r\n_Lepidodendron_, turn sharply upwards before bending outwards again\r\non their way to the leaves. Each leaf-trace consists of a group of\r\nprimary tracheae to which a few secondary tracheae are added during\r\nthe passage through the secondary wood. The secondary xylem forms a\r\ncontinuous cylinder of tracheae with scalariform bands on both radial\r\nand tangential walls; the medullary rays are numerous and consist of\r\nlong and narrow series, usually one cell broad, of parenchymatous\r\ncells with occasional short rays one or more cells in depth.\r\n\r\nThe slightly greater breadth of the rays between each primary xylem\r\nstrand tends to divide the secondary wood into bundles corresponding\r\nin breadth to the primary groups. The outer cortex closely resembles\r\nthat of _Lepidodendron_; it consists internally of radial series\r\nof secondary, elongated and rather stout, elements abutting on the\r\nparenchymatous tissue of the leaf-cushions.\r\n\r\nThe next contribution to our knowledge of the anatomy of _Sigillaria_\r\nwas made by Renault and Grand’Eury[519] who described the structure of\r\n_Sigillaria spinulosa_ Germar[520], a species now recognised as the\r\nLeiodermarian condition of _S. Brardi_, and probably, therefore, not\r\nspecially distinct from the specimen described by Brongniart in 1839 as\r\n_S. elegans_. In Brongniart’s fossil the leaf-cushions are in contact\r\n(Clathrarian form of _S. Brardi_: fig. 203, upper part) whereas in\r\nthe specimen now under consideration the leaf-scars are further apart\r\n(Leiodermarian form of _S. Brardi_, fig. 203, lower part, and fig. 196,\r\nC). It may be, as Scott suggests, that these two specimens are not\r\nspecifically identical but closely allied, an opinion based on certain\r\nanatomical differences[521]; we may, however, include both under the\r\ncomprehensive name _S. Brardi_.\r\n\r\nThe primary xylem (fig. 200, B, _x_), is in some regions separated\r\ninto distinct strands, in others it forms a continuous band equal in\r\nlength to several of the separate groups. This type of stele, in which\r\nthe primary xylem consists in part of separate strands and in part of\r\na continuous cylinder, forms a transition between that represented\r\nin fig. 200, A, and the steles of _Sigillaria elegans_ (fig. 202,\r\nA) and most species of _Lepidodendron_. The tendency of the primary\r\nxylem strands to become united laterally, forming broader bands,\r\nwas first described by Solms-Laubach[522] in a French specimen of\r\n_Sigillaria spinulosa_ in the Williamson collection. The leaf-traces\r\narise from the middle of the concave outer face of the primary xylem\r\ngroups. The inner cortex is composed of small parenchymatous cells as\r\nin _Lepidodendron_, and it is noteworthy that traces of partially\r\ndisorganised tissue, described as large canals, in the region external\r\nto the secondary wood, bear a resemblance[523] to the secretory tissue\r\nof _Lepidodendron_.\r\n\r\nOther interesting features are presented by the structure of the outer\r\ncortex and the parichnos. The outer cortex in the leaf-scar region is\r\ncomposed of parenchyma, but for the most part it consists of radially\r\nelongated groups of thin-walled parenchyma enclosed in a framework\r\nof thicker-walled and elongated elements (fig. 200, B, _c_³). This\r\ntype of cortex, to which Brongniart applied the name _Dictyoxylon_,\r\nwould produce a cast in the case of a partially decorticated stem\r\ncharacterised by a surface formed of irregularly oval and raised areas\r\nbounded by narrow grooves; the greater prominence of the former being\r\ndue to the more rapid decay of the softer tissue, which would produce\r\ndepressions on the exposed face of the dead stem. Casts of this type\r\nare not uncommon in Carboniferous rocks, and while some may belong to\r\nthe Pteridosperm _Lyginodendron_, others may be those of Sigillarian\r\nstems.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 202.\r\n\r\n  A. _Sigillaria elegans_ Brongn.

(From\r\n     specimens in the collection of Prof. Bertrand.)]\r\n\r\nThe large parichnos-strands, produced as in _Lepidodendron_, by the\r\nforking of a single strand arising in the middle cortical region,\r\nconsist in part of tissue containing secretory canals, a structure like\r\nthat recently described by Miss Coward[524] in the large parichnos\r\nstrands of _Syringodendron_ stems.\r\n\r\nAn example of a decorticated specimen is described by Renault[525] as\r\n_Sigillaria xylina_. This stem is presumably referred to _Sigillaria_\r\nbecause the primary xylem consists of separate strands. It is\r\ncharacterised by the unusually large development of secondary wood and\r\nby the relatively small size of the pith. The xylem cylinder has a\r\ndiameter of 4–5 cm. and the pith is only 4–5 mm. in breadth.\r\n\r\nAnother example of a petrified Sigillaria stem has been described by\r\nKidston[526] as _S. elegans_ Brongn.[527] (fig. 193, D), a species\r\ncharacterised by vertical rows of sub-hexagonal and contiguous\r\nleaf-scars and by the presence of verticils of cone-scars. Fig. 193, D,\r\nrepresents Kidston’s specimen in surface-view; one row of leaf-scars\r\nis shown, but most of the superficial tissues have been destroyed.\r\nThe crushed stele, 13 mm. in its longest diameter, has a continuous\r\ncylinder of primary xylem, (fig. 202, A, _x_) characterised by a\r\nregularly crenulate outer margin with the smallest elements at the\r\nedge; the prominent ridges separating the sinuses are rounded. The\r\nleaf-traces arise from the bottom of each sinus; the leaf-bundles are\r\nmesarch, and consist exclusively of primary elements. The secondary\r\nxylem, _x²_, like that of the primary xylem, has a crenulate outer\r\nedge. The most interesting feature of the outer cortex is afforded by a\r\ntangential section which, in addition to the leaf-scars, cuts through a\r\ncone-scar showing a solid primary stele surrounded by the cortex of the\r\ncone-peduncle.\r\n\r\nAnother type of _Sigillaria_, probably _S. elongata_ Brongn. (fig.\r\n202, B, C), which is very similar to _S. scutellata_ has been briefly\r\ndescribed by Prof. Bertrand[528], to whom my thanks are due for the\r\ntwo photographs reproduced in fig. 202, B., C. His specimen, from the\r\nPas de Calais Coal-field, shows a ribbed Rhytidolepis form of surface\r\n(fig. 202, B). The stele (fig. 202, C) agrees closely with that of _S.\r\nelegans_ as described by Kidston, but the ridges on the fluted surface\r\nof the primary xylem are more pointed. “In the immediate neighbourhood\r\nof the origin of a leaf-trace, the spiral elements form a median band\r\nin the middle of a sinus” and from this the leaf-traces are given off.\r\nNo secondary xylem was found in the leaf-traces at any part of their\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nBertrand compares the stele of _S. elongata_ with that of the type\r\nof _Lepidodendron_ represented by the Burntisland species named by\r\nWilliamson _L. brevifolium_ (fig. 186) and now usually referred to\r\n_L. Veltheimianum_; the chief distinguishing features are the greater\r\nprominence in the French species of the surface-ridges or teeth of the\r\nprimary xylem, a feature which occurs in _L. Wünschianum_, and the\r\ndetachment of the leaf-traces from the bottom of each sinus (fig. 202,\r\nC, _lt_) instead of from the sides of the sinus. It is, however, not\r\nclear how far this latter distinction is a real one; in _Lepidodendron\r\nWünschianum_ the leaf-traces appear to arise, as in _Sigillaria_, from\r\nthe middle of each sinus.\r\n\r\nOther types of ribbed Sigillaria stems have been briefly described by\r\nScott[529], Kidston[530], and more recently, by Arber and Thomas[531].\r\n\r\nThe specimen described by Scott agrees in the main with _S. elegans_ of\r\nKidston and with _S. elongata_ of Bertrand.\r\n\r\nKidston’s sections of _S. scutellata_ show a continuous primary xylem\r\ncylinder with a slightly and irregularly crenulate outer margin. It\r\nwould seem that one important diagnostic character in Sigillarian stems\r\nis afforded by the degree and form of the crenulations on the outer\r\nsurface of the primary xylem. _S. scutellata_ has been described also\r\nby Arber and Thomas; these authors were the first to demonstrate the\r\npresence of a ligule and ligular pit on the leaf-base in a petrified\r\nstem, and they also contribute the important fact that the leaf-traces\r\nin passing through the phelloderm bifurcate and enter the leaf as two\r\ndistinct vascular strands. This double bundle has been referred to in\r\nthe description of Sigillaria leaves. (Page 214.)\r\n\r\nAlthough our knowledge of the anatomy of _Sigillaria_ has been\r\nconsiderably extended since Williamson[532] drew attention to our\r\ncomparative ignorance of the subject, there are several points on which\r\ninformation is either lacking or very meagre. As regards the stele,\r\nit is in all types so far investigated, of the medullated type and\r\nconstructed on the same plan as that of _Lepidodendron Wünschianum_,\r\n_L. Veltheimianum_, and other species. Secondary xylem was developed\r\nat an early stage of growth, and its relation to the primary xylem,\r\nfrom which as Kidston points out in his description of _S. elegans_,\r\nit may be separated by a few parenchymatous elements, is like that\r\nin _Lepidodendron_. The tendency of the outer face of the secondary\r\nxylem to present a crenulate appearance in transverse sections may,\r\nas Scott thinks[533], be a feature of some diagnostic importance,\r\nbut this is not a constant character in the genus. In origin and\r\nin their mesarch structure, the leaf-traces closely resemble those\r\nof _Lepidodendron_. The earlier account of the structure of the\r\nleaf-traces of _Sigillaria_, which were described as possessing both\r\ncentrifugal and centripetal wood, led Mettenius[534] to draw attention\r\nto an important anatomical resemblance between this genus and modern\r\nCycads. This comparison was, however, based on a misconception; the\r\nCycadean leaf-trace, consisting solely of primary wood, is not strictly\r\ncomparable with those of some species of _Sigillaria_, in which one\r\npart of the xylem is primary and another secondary. The occasional\r\npresence of secondary xylem in Sigillarian leaf-traces is matched in\r\nsome _Lepidodendra_[535], and cannot be accepted as a distinguishing\r\nfeature.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the leaf-traces from the middle of the sinuses on\r\nthe edge of the primary xylem is regarded as a difference; in\r\n_Lepidodendron_ the leaf-traces are said to arise in some species\r\nfrom the sides of the crenulations; but, as already pointed out,\r\nthis is a distinction of doubtful value. The division of the primary\r\nxylem into separate strands in some stems of _Sigillaria_ of the\r\nClathrarian and Leiodermarian forms is a characteristic peculiarity;\r\nbut _S. spinulosa_ forms a connecting link between this type and the\r\ncontinuous arrangement of the xylem in _S. elongata_ and _S. elegans_.\r\nKidston[536] has shown that the discontinuous primary xylem occurs in\r\nLower Permian species, a fact consistent with the view that the greater\r\nabundance of the centripetally developed wood, characteristic of the\r\nolder species, represents a more primitive feature. This is not merely\r\na conclusion drawn from a consideration of geological age, but it is in\r\nharmony with the view expressed by Scott[537] that as plants achieved\r\ngreater success in producing secondary centrifugal wood, the retention\r\nof any considerable quantity of primary xylem became superfluous. As\r\nyet we know very little of the structure of the perixylic tissues of\r\n_Sigillaria_, but there is no sufficient reason for supposing that\r\nthese differ in essentials from those in _Lepidodendron_. The middle\r\nand outer cortical tissues are practically identical in the two genera.\r\nThe parichnos is of the same type, except that in _Sigillaria_ it\r\nreached greater dimensions in the outer part of its course.\r\n\r\n\r\n                V. _Sigillaria Brardi_[538] Brongniart.\r\n                       Figs. 196, A–C; 200; 203.\r\n\r\n  1822. _Clathraria Brardi_, Brongniart, Classif.

LIX. fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe aerial shoots of this species are occasionally branched\r\ndichotomously[539], the apical portions bearing short crowded\r\nleaves[540]; the surface of the bark is either completely covered with\r\ncontiguous leaf-scars without definite leaf-cushions or with projecting\r\ncushions forming a narrow sloping surface surrounding each leaf-scar.\r\nOther parts of the plant may possess cushions similar in their\r\nkite-shaped form to those of _Lepidodendron_, but without a median\r\nvertical groove, or the leaf-scars may be spirally disposed at varying\r\ndistances apart on a comparatively smooth and longitudinally wrinkled\r\nbark. The species exhibits striking instances of a transition between\r\nthe Favularian, Clathrarian, and Leiodermarian forms of stems. The\r\nleaf-scars, which are hexagonal in outline,—the lateral angles pointed\r\nand transversely elongated, the upper and lower angles rounded,—bear\r\nthree scars, the central leaf-trace and two straight or curved lateral\r\nparichnos scars; a ligular pit occurs immediately above the centre of\r\nthe upper edge of the leaf-scar and occasionally circular elevations\r\nwith a central pit occur singly or in pairs below a leaf-scar (fig.\r\n196, A). The linear leaves, which may persist on shoots having a fairly\r\nlarge diameter[541], have a single median vein and two stomatal grooves\r\non the lower surface[542] (fig. 200, D).\r\n\r\nPartially decorticated and younger shoots are characterised by the\r\noccurrence of pairs of elliptical parichnos areas and a smaller median\r\nleaf-trace scar. The surface of older stems, which may show signs\r\nof longitudinal splitting (_Syringodendron_ state), bears pairs of\r\nparichnos scars reaching a length of 2–2·5 cm. and a breadth of 10–13\r\nmm. The regularity of the leaf-scar arrangement is interrupted at\r\nintervals by the occurrence of more or less regular verticils of scars\r\nmarking the position of deciduous shoots. Grand’Eury[543] has figured\r\ncones which he believes to be those of this species, and Zeiller\r\nrefers the large strobili, _Sigillariostrobus major_, to _Sigillaria\r\nBrardi_[544].\r\n\r\nThe subterranean axes were characterised by spirally disposed\r\nrootlet-scars like those of _Stigmaria ficoides_ (figs. 204, 205) and\r\nby a cortical surface with the features of _Stigmaria rimosa_ Gold.[545]\r\n\r\nThe anatomy of the stele and leaves has already been described (p.\r\n219). The stele of the Stigmarian portion of the plant consists of\r\na band of centripetal primary xylem and a cylinder of centrifugally\r\nformed secondary wood with medullary rays containing vascular bundles\r\npassing out to the rootlets[546].\r\n\r\n_Sigillaria Brardi_ occurs not uncommonly in Permian rocks; it is\r\nrecorded from France[547], Germany[548], Pennsylvania[549], and\r\nelsewhere. It is found in the Upper, Middle, and Lower Coal-Measures\r\nof England[550] and in Permo-Carboniferous strata in Africa[551] and\r\nBrazil[552].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n             UNDERGROUND RHIZOMES AND ROOTS OF PALAEOZOIC\r\n                        LYCOPODIACEOUS PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             =Stigmaria.=\r\n\r\n_Stigmaria ficoides_ is the name given to cylindrical casts met with\r\nin Palaeozoic rocks, from the Devonian[553] to the Permian[554],\r\ncharacterised by a smooth or irregularly wrinkled surface bearing\r\nspirally disposed circular scars bounded by a raised rim and containing\r\na small central pit. It is not uncommon to find evidence of a partial\r\ncollapse of the substance of the plant as seen in fig. 204; this\r\nis doubtless the expression of a shrinkage of the middle cortical\r\nregion, which was composed of a delicate and lacunar system of cells.\r\nThere can be no reasonable doubt that Stigmaria grew in water or\r\nin swampy ground. Specimens are occasionally met with in which the\r\ncast terminates in a bluntly rounded apex; such are, perhaps, young\r\nbranches which have not grown far from the base of the aerial stem\r\nfrom which they arose (cf. fig. 207, B, C). Other examples occur,\r\nsuch as Goeppert[555] figured and Gresley[556] has more recently\r\ndescribed, which are twisted and distorted as though obstacles had been\r\nencountered in the ground in which they grew.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 204. _Stigmaria ficoides_ Brongn.

M.S.]\r\n\r\nThe circular scars mark the bases of long single and occasionally\r\nforked appendages (rootlets) which spread on all sides into the\r\nsurrounding medium (figs. 205, 208). The occurrence of rootlets\r\nradiating through the shale or sandstone affords proof that the\r\nStigmarias are often preserved in their position of growth. This\r\nwas recognised by Steinhauer[557] and Logan[558], and has been more\r\nrecently emphasised by Potonié[559] as an argument in favour of the\r\nview that the beds containing such specimens are old surface-soils.\r\n\r\n_Stigmaria_ usually shows regular dichotomous branching, the arms\r\nspreading horizontally or slightly downwards and always arising\r\nfrom four main branches in the form of a cross (fig. 207). The most\r\nremarkable specimens found in England are described by Williamson[560]\r\nin his monograph of _Stigmaria_. One of two large casts found near\r\nBradford in Yorkshire, and now in the Manchester Museum, shows four\r\nlarge primary arms radiating from the base of an erect stump 4 feet in\r\ndiameter. Each arm divides a short distance from its base into two, and\r\nthe smaller branches extend almost horizontally for several feet[561].\r\n\r\nAn illustration published by Martin in 1809[562] shows a characteristic\r\nfeature of Stigmarian casts, namely the presence of a smaller axis,\r\nusually occupying an eccentric position inside the larger. This\r\nrepresents the cast of the fairly broad parenchymatous pith which,\r\non decay, left a space subsequently filled by sand or mud: at a\r\nlater stage the surrounding wood and cortex were removed and the\r\ncavity so formed was similarly filled. A thin layer of coal formed\r\nby the carbonisation of some of the tissues frequently surrounds the\r\nmedullary cast, and Steinhauer, whose account of the genus is much\r\nfuller and more scientific than those of other earlier and many later\r\nwriters, recognised the true nature of this internal cast. Artis[563]\r\nregarded it as the remains of a young plant, which he described as\r\n“perforating its parent,” at length bursting it and assuming its place,\r\na gratuitously drastic interpretation.\r\n\r\nIn 1838[564] Lindley and Hutton figured a partially petrified specimen\r\nof _Stigmaria_ obtained by Prestwich from Carboniferous rock of\r\nShropshire. This example showed a fairly broad cylinder of secondary\r\nwood penetrated by medullary rays. The medullated stele consisted of a\r\npith surrounded by a small amount of primary xylem and by a cylinder\r\nof secondary scalariform tracheae. The preservation of the tissues\r\nabutting on the edge of the wood is usually very imperfect, and the\r\nmiddle cortex of lacunar parenchyma has practically in every case\r\neluded the action of mineralising agents; the outer cortex, on the\r\nother hand, consists of more resistant elements and is frequently well\r\npreserved. As in _Lepidodendron_ and _Sigillaria_ stems, meristematic\r\nactivity produced a broad band of secondary cortex; and beyond this\r\nwere attached to cushion-like pads the numerous appendages, each\r\nsupplied with a single vascular bundle which arose from the primary\r\nxylem and passed outwards through a medullary ray. There is abundant\r\nevidence that the appendages were hollow, a fact in striking accord\r\nwith the aquatic and semi-aquatic habitat (cf. _Isoetes_ root, fig.\r\n133, G).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 206. _Cyperus papyrus._ Piece of rhizome showing\r\n  rootlet-scars. Nat. size. M.S.]\r\n\r\nThe piece of dried rhizome of _Cyperus papyrus_ shown in fig. 206 is\r\nan almost exact counterpart of _Stigmaria ficoides_; the wrinkled and\r\nshrivelled surface and the circular root-scars containing the remains\r\nof a vascular bundle are striking features in common and, it may be\r\nadded, the two plants, though very different in structure and in\r\nsystematic position, illustrate anatomical adaptations to a similar\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stigmaria ficoides_ Brongniart[565].

XIV.\r\n\r\nThe first figure of _Stigmaria_ is said to be by Petver in 1704;\r\nVolkmann published illustrations of this common fossil in 1720 and\r\nParkinson in 1804[566]. Binney, whose researches may be said to have\r\ninaugurated a new era in the investigation of fossil plants, wrote\r\nin 1844: “Probably no fossil plant has excited more discussion among\r\nbotanists than the _Stigmaria_. It is the most common of the whole\r\nnumber of plants found in the Coal-Measures, but there has hitherto\r\nbeen the greatest uncertainty as to its real nature[567].” This\r\nuncertainty still exists, at least in the minds of some who know enough\r\nof the available data to realise that our knowledge is imperfect.\r\n\r\nTo pass to the questions of the affinity and nature of _Stigmaria_:\r\nBrongniart[568] at first compared his genus with recent Aroideae, but\r\nhe afterwards[569] spoke of it as probably the root of _Sigillaria_.\r\nOther writers regarded _Stigmaria_ as a dicotyledonous plant comparable\r\nwith Cacti and succulent Euphorbias. For many years opinion was divided\r\nas to whether _Stigmaria_ represents an independent and complete plant\r\nor the underground system of _Sigillaria_.\r\n\r\nArtis[570], Lindley and Hutton[571], as well as Goldenberg[572],\r\nbelieved it to be a prostrate plant unconnected with any erect aerial\r\nstem. Goldenberg figured one of the slender rootlets terminating in an\r\noval body described as a reproductive organ. This seed-like impression\r\nis either some extraneous body or an abnormal development at the end\r\nof a rootlet. In 1842 Logan drew attention to the almost complete\r\nmonopolisation by _Stigmaria_ of the underclays, the rock which as\r\na general rule occurs below a seam of coal. He wrote: “The grand\r\ndistinguishing feature of the underclays is the peculiar character of\r\nthe vegetable organic remains; they are always of one kind (_Stigmaria\r\nficoides_) and are so diffused throughout every part of the bed, that\r\nby their uniform effect alone the clay is readily recognised by the eye\r\nof the miner[573].” This fact, which has played a very conspicuous part\r\nin the perennial discussions on the origin of coal, led to the almost\r\ngeneral recognition of the underclays as surface-soils of the Coal\r\nperiod forests.\r\n\r\nThe next step was the discovery of _Stigmaria_ in the Coal-Measures of\r\nLancashire and in the Carboniferous rocks of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia,\r\nforming the basal branches of erect stems identified by Binney[574],\r\nBowman[575] and Richard Brown[576] as undoubted Sigillariae. In one\r\ncase Brown found what he considered to be convincing evidence of the\r\ncontinuity between _Stigmaria_ and _Lepidodendron_.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 Hawkshaw[577] described certain fossil trees, the largest of\r\nwhich had a circumference at the base of 15 ft., discovered, in the\r\ncourse of excavations for a railway in Lancashire, in soft shale at\r\nright angles to the bedding. The surface features were not sufficiently\r\nclear to enable him to decide with certainty between _Sigillaria_ and\r\n_Lepidodendron_, but while inclining to the former, it is interesting\r\nto note that the occurrence of numerous Lepidostrobi near the root led\r\nhim to recognise the possibility of a connexion between the Stigmarian\r\nroots and Lepidodendron stems. In 1846 Binney gave an account of\r\nsimilar trees found at Dukinfield near Manchester: he spoke of one\r\nstem as unquestionably a _Sigillaria_ with vertical ribs, furrows, and\r\nscars, about 15 inches high and 4 ft. 10 inches in circumference. He\r\nexpressed his conviction that “_Sigillaria_ was a plant of an aquatic\r\nnature[578].” Similar descriptions of rooted stems in the Coal-Measures\r\nof Nova Scotia were published by Brown in 1845, 1846 and 1849; in the\r\nlast paper he figured a specimen, which has become famous, showing a\r\nSyringodendron stem terminating in branching Stigmarian (or possibly\r\nStigmariopsis) roots bearing on the lower surface a series of what he\r\ncalled conical tap roots[579]. A similar specimen discovered in Central\r\nFrance nearly fifty years later demonstrated the accuracy of Brown’s\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nDespite these discoveries the root-like nature of _Stigmaria_ was\r\nnot universally accepted. It was, however, generally agreed that\r\n_Stigmaria_ formed the roots of _Sigillaria_; it was, moreover, held by\r\nsome that _Lepidodendron_ stems also possessed this type of root, an\r\nopinion based on Brown’s record and on the occurrence of _Stigmaria_ in\r\nbeds containing _Lepidodendron_ but no _Sigillaria_ stems, as in the\r\nvolcanic beds of Arran and elsewhere, and on observations of Geinitz\r\nand others[580]. There is now general agreement that _Lepidodendron_\r\nand _Sigillaria_ had the same type of “root,” though the connexion of\r\n_Stigmaria_ with the former was not so readily admitted, and indeed\r\nthe evidence in support of it is still very meagre. Goeppert and\r\nother authors were unable to believe that the numerous species of\r\n_Sigillaria_ possessed roots of so uniform a type, but Goeppert, by his\r\nrecognition of several varieties of _Stigmaria_, supplied a partial\r\nanswer to this objection.\r\n\r\nMessrs Mellor and Leslie[581] have described and figured some large\r\ncasts of roots exposed in Permo-Carboniferous rocks in the bed of the\r\nVaal river at Vereeniging (Transvaal) which exhibit certain features\r\nsuggesting comparison with _Stigmaria_. Some of these reach a length\r\nof 40–50 feet and, when complete, were probably not less than 100\r\nfeet long: in some of them the centre of the cast from which forked\r\narms spread almost horizontally shows a depression in the form of\r\na cross indicating a regular dichotomous branching like that of\r\n_Stigmaria_. The authors incline to the belief that the roots belong\r\nto _Noeggerathiopsis_ and not to a lycopodiaceous plant, though\r\nLepidodendroid stems are abundant in the sandstone a few feet higher\r\nin the series. Despite the absence of any Stigmarian scars on the\r\nsurface of the fossil it is probable that these fine specimens are the\r\nrhizomes of some lycopodiaceous plant, possibly _Bothrodendron_, which\r\nis not uncommon in the Vereeniging beds.\r\n\r\nAdmitting that _Stigmaria_ is part of _Sigillaria_, the next question\r\nis, is _Stigmaria_ a root in the ordinary sense, the underground\r\nsystem formed on germination of the spore and of equal age with the\r\nshoot, or did it bear a different relation to the Sigillarian stems?\r\nTo this question different answers would still be given. Goeppert[582]\r\ndiscussed evidence in favour of the view that aerial Sigillarian shoots\r\nwere produced as vegetative buds on pre-existing Stigmarian axes,\r\nlike young moss plants on a protonema. At a later date Renault[583]\r\ndeveloped a similar view as regards _Sigillaria_; but we may pass on to\r\nconsider the more recent and complete observations of Grand’Eury[584]\r\nand Solms-Laubach[585].\r\n\r\nThe recognition of two distinct types of Stigmariae in the\r\nCoal-Measures of Central France led Grand’Eury[586] to institute a\r\nnew genus, _Stigmariopsis_. This type, which is characterised by a\r\ndifference in habit as well as by other distinguishing features,\r\nis represented by such specimens as those figured by Goldenberg as\r\n_Stigmaria abbreviata_, bearing lenticular scars spirally disposed on\r\na cortical surface characterised by irregular longitudinal wrinklings.\r\n_Stigmariopsis_ has frequently been found in direct continuity with\r\nSigillarian stems of the Leiodermarian-Clathrarian type, spreading\r\nobliquely downwards in the form of rapidly narrowing arms clothed with\r\nslender and usually simple appendages; and from the under surface of\r\nthese arms short conical outgrowths are given off. It is probable,\r\nas Solms-Laubach believes, that _Stigmariopsis_ was represented also\r\nby long horizontally creeping rhizomes[587] of uniform breadth from\r\nwhich ribless Sigillarian aerial shoots arose as bud-like outgrowths.\r\nGrand’Eury, the author of the genus, confined the term to the shorter\r\nand more rapidly tapered organs spreading from the base of erect\r\nstems; the horizontal rhizomes of all Sigillarian stems he refers to\r\n_Stigmaria_. The pith-casts of _Sigillariopsis_ may be recognised by\r\ntheir long vertical ridges and grooves, a feature readily understood by\r\nreference to the stem structure. The _Stigmariopsis_ rhizomes though\r\nrare in England have been recognised by Dr Kidston[588] in the Middle\r\nCoal-Measures of Yorkshire; he has figured a pith-cast very like that\r\nillustrated in Solms-Laubach’s Memoir as _Stigmariopsis anglica_.\r\n\r\nThe surface-features of a _Stigmariopsis_ pith-cast are clearly shown\r\non a specimen from St Étienne in the Williamson collection[589].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STIGMARIOPSIS]\r\n\r\nThe most complete account of Grand’Eury’s views in regard to the\r\nanchoring and absorbing organs of _Sigillaria_ is given in his\r\nmonograph on the Coal-field of Gard[590], St Étienne, and these are\r\nclearly stated also by Solms-Laubach[591] who confirms the conclusions\r\nof the French author as to the manner of development of the aerial\r\nshoots. Grand’Eury believes that both _Stigmaria_ and _Stigmariopsis_\r\nare rhizomes and not true roots. The surface-features of _Stigmaria_\r\nhave already been described. This type Grand’Eury speaks of as\r\ncharacterised by the uniform diameter and considerable horizontal\r\nelongation of the bifurcated axes; he thinks they grew both as\r\nfloating rhizomes and on the ground: they may frequently be traced for\r\na considerable distance without showing any signs of connexion with\r\naerial shoots, but occasionally they have been seen in organic union\r\nwith Sigillarian stems. He believes that these rhizomes were produced\r\nas the result of germination under water of the spores of _Sigillaria_\r\nor _Lepidodendron_ and developed as long and branched aquatic\r\nrhizomes capable of independent existence. Under certain conditions,\r\nas he thinks in shallower water, the rhizomes produced bulb-like\r\noutgrowths which grew into erect stems having the surface-features\r\nof _Sigillaria_. This method of origin is practically the same as\r\nthat described by Goeppert in 1865. The vascular medullated cylinder\r\nof these erect branches was in direct continuity with that of the\r\nStigmarian rhizomes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 207. An early stage in the development of\r\n  _Sigillaria_.\r\n\r\n  A. Surface-features enlarged. (After Grand’Eury.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 208. Later stage in the development of\r\n  _Sigillaria_; _Syringodendron_ with _Stigmariopsis_. (After\r\n  Grand’Eury.)]\r\n\r\nThe next stage is that in which the undifferentiated bulb becomes\r\nswollen at the base and develops four primary roots (fig. 207 B, C)\r\nwhich grow obliquely downwards and produce numerous rootlets. Meanwhile\r\nthe parent rhizome gradually decays, finally setting free the aerial\r\nstems which are now provided with spreading and forked roots (fig.\r\n208) such as we are familiar with in English specimens as _Stigmaria\r\nficoides_, but which in the French specimens show the features of\r\n_Stigmariopsis_. At this later stage conical outgrowths are formed\r\nfrom the under surface of the Stigmariopsis arranged in a more or less\r\nregular series surrounding the centre of the forked and spreading roots\r\n(fig. 209). These conical and positively geotropic organs were long\r\nago described by Richard Brown as tap-roots. Grand’Eury’s conclusions\r\nare briefly as follows: _Sigillaria_, and we may add _Lepidodendron_,\r\nhad no true roots and in this respect are comparable with _Psilotum_\r\n(fig. 118): the organs which are described by Grand’Eury as roots\r\nare correctly so named in a physiological sense, but morphologically\r\nthey do not strictly conform, either in origin or in the arrangement\r\nof their appendages, to true roots. The question as to whether they\r\nare entitled to the designation root is one which it is needless and\r\nindeed futile to discuss in detail; it would be conceding too much to\r\na formal academic standpoint to refrain from applying to them the term\r\nroot, as that best describes their share in the life of the Sigillarian\r\nstems. The horizontal Stigmarian axes are rhizomes in the ordinary\r\nsense of the term and from these were developed Sigillarian shoots,\r\ncharacterised in the lower portions by large parichnos strands. From\r\nthe base of the young bulbous shoots roots were formed: these roots\r\nbeing, in the French specimens, of the _Stigmariopsis_ type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 209. _Stigmariopsis_ and “tap-roots.” (After\r\n  Grand’Eury.)]\r\n\r\nThese conclusions require some modification when applied to British\r\nrepresentatives of the arborescent Lycopodiales. The long spreading\r\nand dichotomously branched root-like organs attached to the base of\r\nSigillarian and Lepidodendron stems are true examples of _Stigmaria\r\nficoides_ or other species. _Stigmariopsis_ occurs but rarely. This\r\nmarked difference between French and English specimens may be explained\r\nif we adopt the opinion of Solms-Laubach, who believes that the true\r\n_Stigmaria_ represents both the parent rhizome and the later-formed\r\nroots of the Rhytidolepis Sigillarian species and of _Lepidodendron_,\r\nthe _Stigmariopsis_ form having the corresponding relation to the\r\nLeiodermarian-Clathrarian species.\r\n\r\nThe opinion expressed by Williamson[592] in 1892 that Grand’Eury’s\r\nhypothesis “appears to be identical with the vague and speculative\r\nguesses that were prevalent among us in the early years of the present\r\n[nineteenth] century” illustrates the strength of conviction based on\r\nEnglish specimens as to the root-nature of _Stigmaria_.\r\n\r\nThere is undoubtedly considerable confusion, which can be cleared\r\nup only by further research, as to the precise relation between\r\n_Stigmaria_ and _Stigmariopsis_ on the one hand and the different\r\ntypes of _Sigillariae_ on the other. The main contention, and this is\r\nthe most important point, of Renault, Grand’Eury and Solms-Laubach as\r\nto the manner of formation of the aerial shoots from rhizomes and the\r\nsubsequent production of forked roots and their ultimate separation\r\nfrom the parent rhizome is, as I believe, correct. Williamson held\r\nthat _Stigmaria_ must be regarded as a true root; he found no evidence\r\nto support the view that the large rooted stem discovered by Hawshaw,\r\nBinney, and others had been originally produced from aquatic rhizomes.\r\nIt must, however, be remembered that Grand’Eury’s opinion is based\r\non evidence afforded by the exceptionally well displayed Sigillarian\r\nforests of St Étienne, on a scale such as English strata have not\r\nas yet afforded. Moreover, the absence of any parent-rhizome in\r\nassociation with the rooted stumps described by Williamson and by\r\nothers is not a serious argument against their rhizome origin.\r\n\r\nThe specimen represented in fig. 209, which was examined _in situ_\r\nby Solms-Laubach and Grand’Eury, shows a Sigillarian stem in the\r\nSyringodendron condition bearing rows of paired parichnos scars;\r\nfrom the base forked and rapidly tapering arms radiate through the\r\nsurrounding rock and, as shown by other specimens, these bear numerous\r\nappendages like those of the English Stigmarias. The surface-features\r\nof the arms are those of _Stigmariopsis_ and the centre of each, as\r\nseen on the broken face, is occupied by a pith-cast characterised by\r\nparallel longitudinal ridges resembling those on the medullary casts of\r\n_Calamites_. It is noteworthy that the petrified rhizome originally\r\ndescribed by Renault as _Stigmaria flexuosa_, and afterwards identified\r\nby him as the subterranean system of _Sigillaria Brardi_, possesses\r\na vascular cylinder composed of primary xylem strands of crescentic\r\ntransverse section lining the pith; a cast of the pith, after the\r\nremoval by decay of its delicate parenchymatous tissue, would exhibit\r\nthe surface-features of _Stigmariopsis_. _Stigmaria flexuosa_ no\r\ndoubt represents a true _Stigmariopsis_ rhizome. On the other hand,\r\nas Williamson has shown, the inner surface of the wood of _Stigmaria\r\nficoides_ consists of a reticulum of xylem with meshes of medullary-ray\r\ntissue; a cast of such a surface presents a very different appearance\r\nfrom that of _Stigmariopsis_.\r\n\r\nReturning to fig. 209: from the lower surface of the _Stigmariopsis_\r\narms numerous conical outgrowths, reaching a length of several\r\ncentimetres, project vertically downwards; these also possess\r\nStigmariopsis pith-casts and are identical with the “tap-roots” of\r\nRichard Brown. The stump seen in fig. 209 shows the characteristic\r\nhollow base of the erect stem: this is the region which, it is\r\nbelieved, represents the position of the Stigmarian rhizome from which\r\nthe aerial shoot was developed. Although no remains of the parent\r\nrhizome were found, traces of the rootlets which probably belonged to\r\nit were found in the neighbourhood. The absence of the actual rhizome\r\nis, however, not surprising as it would not persist after its aerial\r\nSigillarian branches had attained independence by the development of\r\ntheir own dichotomously branched absorbing and holdfast organs.\r\n\r\nThe Stigmarian axes of Palaeozoic Lycopods are compared by Miss\r\nThomas[593] with the prop-roots of certain recent flowering plants\r\nwhich grow in tropical tidal swamps; their roots grow downwards from\r\nthe stem at an angle of 50°-60° before spreading out horizontally.\r\nThis author also makes some interesting suggestions in regard to\r\nthe evidence afforded by anatomical structure as to the habitat of\r\n_Sigillaria_ and _Lepidodendron_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anatomy._\r\n\r\nThe more important anatomical features of _Stigmaria_ must be dealt\r\nwith briefly. Williamson’s monograph, published in 1887[594], is\r\nconsiderably in advance of the work of that of any of the numerous\r\nwriters who had previously dealt with the subject. The diagrammatic\r\ntransverse section reproduced in fig. 210, H, illustrates the general\r\narrangement of the tissues. The medullated stele was described by\r\nWilliamson as consisting entirely of centrifugally developed secondary\r\nxylem and distinguished, therefore, from the stele of a _Lepidodendron_\r\nor _Sigillaria_ by the absence of a centripetally produced primary\r\nxylem zone. The secondary xylem tracheae are characterised by\r\nscalariform pits on both radial and tangential walls and, as shown in a\r\nfigure given by Solms-Laubach[595], the spaces between the transverse\r\nbars are bridged across by fine threads, as in the tracheae of\r\n_Lepidodendron_.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest specimens of a petrified _Stigmaria_ which I have\r\nseen is one lent to me by Mr Lomax from the Coal-Measures of Halifax in\r\nwhich the flattened transverse section measures 18 cm. × 3·5 cm., the\r\ncylinder of wood being 1·1 cm. × 7 mm. in diameter.\r\n\r\nIn French examples of _Stigmaria_ or _Stigmariopsis_ it has been\r\ndemonstrated by Renault[596] that primary xylem strands occur very like\r\nthose in the stem of some species of _Sigillariae_ (see p. 219). If a\r\nwell-preserved section of an English _Stigmaria_ is examined it will\r\nbe seen that the edge of the secondary wood consists of a few narrower\r\nelements which do not exhibit the radial seriation characteristic of\r\nsecondary elements.\r\n\r\nA type of _Stigmaria_ characterised by centripetal primary wood has\r\nbeen described by Weiss[597] and referred by him to _Bothrodendron\r\nmundum_; the main results of his observations are stated in the\r\naccount of _Bothrodendron_ on a subsequent page. This discovery is\r\nof considerable interest not only as rendering our knowledge of\r\n_Bothrodendron_ remarkably complete but as confirmatory of Renault’s\r\naccount of French Stigmarian axes in which centripetal primary wood\r\nis well developed between the secondary xylem and the centre of the\r\nstele. The Stigmarian axis of Bothrodendron was originally figured\r\nby Williamson as _Lepidodendron mundum_[598]. The chief difference\r\nbetween Weiss’s specimen and those described by Renault[599] as the\r\nStigmarian axes of _Sigillaria Brardi_, is that in the English plant\r\nthe centripetal wood forms a cylinder of uniform breadth instead of a\r\nband with a crenulated inner margin as figured by Renault.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STIGMARIA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 210. _Stigmaria._\r\n\r\n  A.

Diagrammatic section of _Stigmaria_: _p_, phelloderm; _r_,\r\n     rootlets.]\r\n\r\nAn interesting agreement between the French and English specimens\r\nis the occurrence in the cortex of groups of reticulate elements:\r\nin Weiss’s section these are short and wide and occur in the middle\r\ncortex; in Renault’s plant they are more fusiform and occur in the\r\nsecondary cortical tissue. These elements appear to have been arranged\r\nas an interlacing network in the middle cortex and were in close\r\nconnexion with the rootlet-bundles, comparable, as Weiss points out,\r\nwith the transfusion tracheids accompanying Lepidodendron leaf-traces.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that these short and wide tracheal elements served for\r\nwater-storage and thus afford another indication of the xerophilous\r\ncharacter of the Carboniferous Lycopods, a feature possibly connected\r\nwith a salt-marsh habitat.\r\n\r\nThe presence of conspicuous medullary rays gives the secondary xylem\r\nof _Stigmaria_ the appearance of being divided into several more or\r\nless distinct groups (fig. 210, E, _St_). In tangential longitudinal\r\nsection the xylem assumes the form of a broad reticulum with lenticular\r\nmeshes filled with medullary-ray tissue through which strands of xylem\r\nare cut across in a transverse direction as they pass outwards from\r\nthe inner edge of the wood to supply the rootlets. In addition to\r\nthese broader or primary medullary rays, there were numerous secondary\r\nrays composed of narrow plates of parenchymatous cells one or several\r\nelements in depth. As Williamson pointed out, the medullary-ray tissue\r\nconsists in part of radially elongated tracheal elements with spiral or\r\nscalariform thickening bands like those described in the same position\r\nin Lepidodendron stems.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the minute structure of the tissues abutting on the\r\nsecondary xylem is far from complete.\r\n\r\nThe xylem is succeeded by a zone of delicate cells which was the\r\nseat of meristematic activity. It is noteworthy that in a section\r\nfigured by Williamson[600] there is the same disparity in size between\r\nthe outermost elements of the xylem and the adjacent cells of the\r\nmeristematic zone as in Lepidodendron stems. Beyond this region an\r\nimperfectly preserved lacunar tissue occurs like that which I have\r\ncalled the secretory zone in Lepidodendron stems; but information as\r\nto the structure of this part of _Stigmaria_ is much more incomplete\r\nthan in the case of the aerial shoots. The middle cortex was of the\r\nsame lacunar type as in the stems, and the fact that it is never well\r\npreserved in large Stigmarian axes suggests that it may have been\r\neven more richly supplied than in the aerial stems with an aerating\r\nsystem of spaces. The outer cortex, consisting in young examples of\r\nlarge-celled parenchyma, became at an early stage of growth the seat of\r\ncambial activity which resulted in the production of radially placed\r\nseries of secondary elements (fig. 210, H, _p_). The outer and older\r\nelements of this secondary cortex are more tangentially stretched than\r\nthe inner cells, a necessary result of the position of the phellogen on\r\nthe internal edge of the tissue and of the increasing girth of the axis.\r\n\r\nIn comparatively young Stigmarian axes the outer cortex already\r\npossesses a band of secondary radially disposed cells characterised\r\nby the greater tangential extension of the more external elements;\r\nusually this tissue terminates abruptly on the inner edge and the\r\nline of separation no doubt marks the position of the phellogen.\r\nOccasionally some delicate secondary elements are preserved internal\r\nto the phellogen, and these in young specimens form a narrow cylinder\r\ncomposed in part of radially elongated cells showing signs of recent\r\ntangential divisions. In its earlier stage of activity the phellogen\r\nseems to form a greater amount of secondary tissue on the outside, but\r\nthis is clearly not of the nature of cork, the tissue which occupies a\r\ncorresponding position in recent plants. The primary cortex shows no\r\nsigns of shrinkage or collapse as would be the case were it cut off\r\nfrom the vascular system by a zone of impermeable cork.\r\n\r\nFig. 210, G, represents a piece of the external tissue of a specimen in\r\nwhich the slightly flattened xylem cylinder measures 1·4 × 1 cm.; the\r\ninner cortex has disappeared and fragments only of the middle cortex\r\nare preserved. The outer cortex, with an average breadth of 2 mm.,\r\nconsists superficially of primary parenchyma with a somewhat uneven\r\nsurface and with a rootlet attached here and there; a short distance\r\nbelow the surface is a band of conspicuous cells, _b_, characterised\r\nby dark contents suggesting very imperfectly preserved fungal hyphae,\r\nbut the nature of the substance filling the cells cannot be made out\r\nwith certainty. It is, however, interesting to find that this dark\r\nband constitutes an obvious feature (fig. 210 H, _b_); its position is\r\ncomparable with that of the dark-walled cells in the outer cortex of\r\nrootlets. A short distance internal to this dark band tangentially\r\nelongated cells form the outermost elements of the secondary cortex;\r\nthese become gradually narrower towards the interior and pass into\r\nradial series of smaller cells of uniform size, as seen on the inner\r\nedge of fig. 210, G. At the inner boundary of this tissue, just below\r\nthe region shown at the bottom of the drawing, was situated the\r\nphellogen. Such traces of tissue as occur on the inner side of the line\r\nwhere splitting has usually occurred, consist of thinner elements with\r\nrecently formed tangential walls and probably represent an early stage\r\nin the development of phelloderm.\r\n\r\nA much older section is shown in part in fig. 210, E. The secondary\r\nxylem cylinder, _St_, is shown in the lower part of the section; beyond\r\nthis is a band of secondary tissue which reaches in some places a\r\nbreadth of 6 cm. The greater part of this tissue consists of phelloderm\r\nof very uniform structure made up of radial series of cells: this\r\nis interrupted in most parts of the section by a gap crowded with\r\nintruded rootlets (a portion of this is enlarged in fig. 210, D).\r\nBeyond this gap the secondary tissue consists of radial series of cells\r\ncharacterised by the considerable tangential elongation of many of\r\nthe elements, precisely like the tissue figured by Williamson. In all\r\nprobability the gap represents a line of weakness due to the phellogen,\r\nand if this is the case it is clear that in an old _Stigmaria_ the\r\nphelloderm exceeded in amount the tissue formed external to the\r\nphellogen. The secondary tissue on the inner side of the phellogen is\r\ncharacterised by numerous irregular concentric lines superficially\r\nresembling rings of growth in the wood of a Conifer: these are,\r\nhowever, not the result of any periodic change in external conditions,\r\nbut are apparently due to crushing of the tissue and are possibly,\r\nto some extent, the result of the presence of secretory strands like\r\nthose in the phelloderm of _Lepidodendron_. The surface of this\r\nolder rhizome retains patches of primary tissue, and an occasional\r\nrootlet, as at _r_, fig. 210, E, is seen in connexion with the cortex;\r\nthe cortex has been vertically fissured as the result of secondary\r\ngrowth and presents an appearance like that shown in _Lepidodendron\r\nWünschianum_ and _L. Veltheimianum_ (figs. 181, A, and 186, A).\r\n\r\nThe form in which a Stigmarian rootlet is usually preserved is shown\r\nin fig. 210, D; the single vascular bundle strand with its endarch\r\nprotoxylem (fig. 210, B, _px_) is enclosed by a ring of inner cortical\r\nparenchyma (fig. 210, F, _c_¹); the cells in immediate contact with\r\nthe xylem having usually disappeared. Beyond the middle cortical\r\nspace a second cylinder of parenchyma represents the outer cortex (F,\r\n_c_³) in which a layer of dark-walled cells (_b_, fig. 210, F) may be\r\ncompared with the hypodermal band in the main Stigmarian axis (G, _b_).\r\nThese Stigmarian rootlets, usually less than 1 cm. in diameter, are the\r\ncommonest objects in sections of the calcareous nodules from English\r\ncoal-seams. A good example of their abundance is shown in fig. 210, D\r\nand E; here they have invaded the space formed by the splitting of the\r\nsecondary cortical tissues along the line of the phellogen and a few\r\nare seen here and there in the deeper layers of the phelloderm (_s_,\r\nfig. 210, E). Not infrequently the close contact of these ubiquitous\r\nrootlets with the tissues of the plant which they have invaded leads to\r\nconfusion between invader and invaded. Partially decayed tissues lying,\r\nprobably, under water were penetrated by Stigmarian rootlets in exactly\r\nthe same way as the roots of recent plants bore through vegetable\r\nsubstances which happen to be in their path. The rootlet bundles are\r\nin the first instance composed of the primary tracheae which line\r\nthe inner edge of the secondary xylem; these receive additions from\r\nthe meristematic zone, and thus, when seen in the cortex outside the\r\nstelar region, are found to consist in part of primary and in part of a\r\nfan-shaped group of secondary tracheae. On the other hand, the monarch\r\nbundle as it appears in a free rootlet is usually composed entirely of\r\nprimary elements (fig. 210, A–C, F). It has been shown by Weiss[601]\r\nthat in the Stigmarian rhizome of what is probably _Lepidodendron\r\nfuliginosum_, the rootlet bundle is accompanied by a parichnos strand,\r\nbut this has not been detected in the ordinary _Stigmaria ficoides_.\r\nWhen free from the parent axis a rootlet usually consists of an\r\nouter cylinder of cortex enclosing a broad space in which remnants\r\nof lacunar tissue are sometimes seen. The relation of the external\r\nfeatures of a well-preserved Stigmarian rootlet-scar to the internal\r\nstructure of a petrified rootlet is very clearly seen on comparing\r\nsuch sections as those represented in fig. 210, D, with the form of\r\nthe scar on a Stigmarian cast. A specimen figured by Hooker[602] in\r\n1848 affords a good illustration of the structure of a rootlet-base as\r\nseen in an unusually complete cast; this correlation of anatomical and\r\nsurface features is clearly described also by Williamson[603] and by\r\nSolms-Laubach[604]. It is probable that even during life the rootlets\r\nwere hollow for a part at least of their length as are the roots of\r\n_Isoetes_ (fig. 133, G).\r\n\r\nAn interesting discovery was made a few years ago which confirmed a\r\nstatement by Renault which Williamson was unable to accept, namely\r\nthat the xylem bundle of a rootlet occasionally gives off a delicate\r\ntracheal strand at right angles to the long axis of a rootlet. In some\r\nrootlets Weiss[605] found obliquely running delicate strands of xylem,\r\nsurrounded by a layer of parenchymatous tissue, in the space between\r\nthe vascular bundle and the outer cortical cylinder. It is clear that a\r\nfew spiral tracheids are occasionally given off from the protoxylem of\r\na rootlet bundle: these follow an oblique course to the outer cortex,\r\nwhere in some cases they have been traced into connexion with short\r\nand spirally marked cells resembling transfusion tracheae (fig. 210,\r\nA). This arrangement may serve as a means of facilitating the passage\r\nof water absorbed by the superficial cells into the xylem strand. It\r\nshould be noticed that, like roots of recent water-plants, the rootlets\r\nof _Stigmaria_ had no root-hairs. Fig. 210, F, shows a transverse\r\nsection of part of a rootlet in which the outer cortical cylinder,\r\n_c_³, is connected, as in the roots of _Isoetes_, with the sheath\r\nsurrounding the vascular bundle. A few obliquely cut tracheae are seen\r\nin this section traversing the connecting band of parenchyma _t_, fig.\r\n210, A.\r\n\r\nA point of biological interest in connexion with Stigmaria rootlets is\r\nthe occasional presence of hypertrophied cells, the large size of which\r\nis due to the attacks of a fungus named by Weiss[606] _Urophlyctites\r\nstigmariae_.\r\n\r\nIn addition to _Stigmaria ficoides_, which is by far the commonest\r\nform, a few other species have been founded on external characters.\r\nOne of these is represented by _Stigmaria stellata_, Goepp.[607],\r\ncharacterised by the presence of radially disposed ridges and small\r\ntubercles surrounding each rootlet-scar. Kidston refers to Goeppert’s\r\nspecies as a Lower Carboniferous type. We have no evidence as to the\r\nmeaning of the stellate ridges and tubercles, nor have we any reason\r\nto suppose that this form differed essentially in structure from\r\n_Stigmaria ficoides_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n                           =Bothrodendreae.=\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Bothrodendron._ Figs. 211–216.\r\n\r\nAlthough in many respects the genus _Bothrodendron_ agrees very closely\r\nin habit and in its anatomical features with _Lepidodendron_, there are\r\nreasons for referring it to a distinct family of Palaeozoic Lycopods.\r\nAs the following description shows, the external features do not differ\r\nin any essential points from those of certain types of the genus\r\n_Sigillaria_, particularly such a species as _S. rimosa_, Gold.[608],\r\nwhich has recently been refigured and described by Nathorst[609] from\r\nGoldenberg’s type-specimen in the Stockholm Museum. The small size of\r\nthe leaf-scars is, however, a characteristic feature of _Bothrodendron_\r\n(fig. 212, F); but a more important point is the fact that in a\r\nrecently described[610] English example of a cone of _Bothrodendron_\r\n(fig. 216), the sporangia are very like those of recent Lycopods, and\r\ndiffer from the radially elongated sporangia of _Lepidostrobus_. On the\r\nother hand, a French cone described by Zeiller[611] as _Lepidostrobus\r\nOlryi_, which is probably a strobilus of _Bothrodendron_, has the\r\nradially elongated type of sporangium (fig. 212, E). The comparative\r\nabundance of _Bothrodendron_ in Lower Carboniferous and Devonian rocks\r\npoints to the greater antiquity of this member of the Lycopodiales as\r\ncompared with _Lepidodendron_.\r\n\r\nThe name _Bothrodendron_ was instituted by Lindley and Hutton[612]\r\nfor impressions of stems from the English Coal-Measures, characterised\r\nby two opposite rows of large depressions like those shown in fig.\r\n211 and, in one of the specimens, by “a considerable number of\r\nminute dots, arranged in a quincuncial manner.” The minute dots were\r\nrecognised as leaf-scars and the cup-like cavities were described\r\nas probably connected with the occurrence of large cones. On very\r\nslender evidence this Palaeozoic plant, which was named _Bothrodendron\r\npunctatum_, was considered by these authors as probably a member\r\nof the Coniferales. The large stem from the Coal-Measures in the\r\nneighbourhood of Mons, Belgium, shown in fig. 211, affords a good\r\nillustration of _Bothrodendron_ in a partially decorticated condition,\r\nexhibiting a row of depressions similar to those on the Ulodendron\r\nform of _Lepidodendron Veltheimianum_ (fig. 157), but distinguished by\r\nthe eccentric position of the scar at the bottom of each cup-shaped\r\ncavity: in the Belgian specimen, which is partially decorticated and\r\nshows the leaf-traces as small dots, the depressions have a diameter of\r\n9 cm. It is believed by some authors that these Ulodendron shoots of\r\n_Bothrodendron_ and _Lepidodendron_ owe their characteristic appearance\r\nto the pressure of large cones, but, as I have already stated, there\r\nare reasons for preferring the view that these crater-like hollows are\r\nthe scars of deciduous branches. Our knowledge of the strobili borne by\r\nBothrodendron stems is still meagre, but we have no reason to assume\r\nthe existence of any cones large enough to produce by the pressure\r\nof their bases such depressions as those shown in fig. 211. In one\r\nspecies at least the strobili were borne terminally on slender shoots\r\n(fig. 213). The Ulodendron condition has so far been recognised in one\r\nspecies only, _B. punctatum_.\r\n\r\nIn his catalogue of Palaeozoic plants, Kidston[613] included\r\n_Bothrodendron punctatum_ as a synonym of _Sigillaria discophora_\r\nKönig, a mistake which he afterwards rectified[614]: the generic name\r\n_Bothrodendron_ was generally ignored by authors in the belief that\r\nthe specimens described by Lindley and Hutton were not generically\r\ndistinct from the fossils originally figured by Rhode as _Ulodendron_.\r\nIt was Prof. Zeiller who first demonstrated that the English authors\r\nwere justified in their choice of a new designation for stems with\r\nlarge depressions in association with minute leaf-scars. In 1859\r\nHaughton[615] proposed a new family name Cyclostigmaceae for some Upper\r\nDevonian plants from County Kilkenny, Ireland: he described three\r\nspecies of his new genus _Cyclostigma_, _Cyclostigma kiltorkense, C.\r\nminutum_, and _C. Griffithsi_; these are now generally recognised as a\r\nsingle species of _Bothrodendron_, though, as Nathorst suggests, the\r\nIrish plant should perhaps be separated as a sub-genus _Bothrodendron_\r\n(_Cyclostigma_) by reason of certain minor differences which\r\ndistinguish it from other species of the genus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 211. _Bothrodendron punctatum._ Part of a specimen\r\n  from near Mons (Hainaut), in the Brussels Museum. (Reduced.)]\r\n\r\nAnother generic name, _Rhytidodendron_, was instituted by Boulay in\r\n1876 for stems characterised by a finely wrinkled bark and small\r\nspirally disposed leaf-scars. A short description of this type, which\r\noccurs in the Middle and Lower Coal-Measures, may serve to illustrate\r\nthe external features of the commonest British example of the genus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_a.

The leaf-scars on the smaller shoots occur\r\non elongated cushions (fig. 212, C, D) with a transversely wrinkled\r\nsurface; on the older branches the leaf-scars are separated by fairly\r\nlarge areas of bark characterised by sinuous transverse grooves and\r\nnarrow ridges bearing numerous small pits, as shown on an enlarged\r\nscale in fig. 212, A. The original surface-features are shown on the\r\nleft of the drawing, and a slightly deeper level in the cortex is\r\nrepresented on the right-hand side. The absence of leaf-cushions on the\r\nolder shoots is probably the result of secondary thickening, which also\r\nalters the size and shape of the leaf-scars. Each scar has three pits\r\non its surface, as in _Lepidodendron_; a central leaf-trace scar and\r\nlateral parichnos scars. The circular pit above the leaf-scars, which\r\noccurs in most species, marks the position of the ligule. The relation\r\nof the short leaves, 5 mm. long, to the leaf-cushions is shown in fig.\r\n212, D. The absence of leaves, except in impressions of slender twigs,\r\nmay be interpreted as an indication that they were shed at an early\r\nstage and did not persist many years. The leaf-cushions of the smaller\r\nshoots of _Bothrodendron minutifolium_ closely resemble those figured\r\nby Weiss on a Devonian plant, _Lepidodendron Losseni_[616].\r\n\r\nOne of the few examples so far discovered of a Bothrodendron cone is\r\nshown in fig. 213; this specimen, at least 10 cm. long, was found by\r\nMr Hemingway in the Middle Coal-Measures of Yorkshire and described\r\nby Dr Kidston. Numerous sporophylls are attached at right angles to\r\nthe axis, the surface of which is protected by their upturned distal\r\nportions; the arrangement of the parts appears to be the same as in\r\n_Lepidostrobus_. A specimen figured by Zeiller as _Lepidostrobus\r\nOlryi_, which Kidston is probably correct in identifying with\r\n_Bothrodendron minutifolium_, shows that each sporophyll carries a\r\nhorizontally elongated sporangium (fig. 212, E).\r\n\r\n\r\n_b.

Figs. 211, 212 B,\r\nF.\r\n\r\nThis species, which is less abundant than _B. minutifolium_, in British\r\nCoal-Measures, has been described by several authors as _Ulodendron_\r\non account of the occurrence of large depressions, like those shown\r\nin fig. 211, on certain branches of the plant. At the suggestion of\r\nDr Kidston, Prof. Zeiller[618] figured an English specimen of this\r\nspecies, presented to the Paris Museum by Mr Hutton, in which the\r\nleaf-scars are preserved on the bark of a stem with Ulodendron scars.\r\nThe surface of the bark is characterised by numerous small pits and\r\ndiscontinuous vertical lines in contrast to the transverse lines of _B.\r\nminutifolium_ (cf. fig. 212, A and F). The leaf-scars on the smaller\r\nshoots may have a diameter of only 0·3–0·5 mm., while on the larger\r\nbranches they reach a breadth of 1 mm. The ligule-pit may be in contact\r\nwith the upper edge (fig. 212, F) of the leaf-scar or separated from it\r\nby a short distance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 213. _Bothrodendron minutifolium_ Cone.

Kilkenny on which\r\nHaughton founded this and two other species may be regarded as\r\nrepresenting one specific type. He described the circular leaf-scars\r\nas arranged in alternating whorls. In habit the Irish species agrees\r\nwith _Bothrodendron minutifolium_, but the leaf-scars are more\r\nelliptical (fig. 212, H) and the ligule-pit is usually absent. The\r\nleaf-scar shown in fig. H is 1·2 mm. broad and 1·4 mm. in height. The\r\nlarge collection obtained during the visit of a Swedish expedition\r\nto Bear Island in 1898 under the leadership of Dr Nathorst has\r\nmaterially increased our knowledge of this ancient type. The form\r\nof the leaf-scars varies according to the age of the branch and\r\ntheir disposition is far from constant even on the same specimen; in\r\nsome cases the scars are in fairly regular whorls (fig. 212, G; an\r\nIrish specimen) while in others they are in regular spirals. This\r\nirregularity of arrangement, which is well illustrated by Nathorst’s\r\nfigures of Bear Island and Irish specimens, finds its counterpart,\r\nthough in a less marked form, in recent species of _Lycopodium_, _e.g.\r\nL. Selago_. Partially decorticated stems may present a superficial\r\nresemblance to _Calamites_, the fissured bark simulating the ribs\r\nof a Calamitean cast. Such stems, as Nathorst has pointed out, were\r\nmistaken by Heer for _Calamites radiatus_. The smaller branches\r\nare characterised by a smooth surface, and older shoots resemble\r\n_Bothrodendron minutifolium_ in the presence of fine vertical lines.\r\nThe preservation of only one pit on the leaf-scars of many examples\r\nled authors to conclude that the species is peculiar in this respect,\r\nbut Nathorst has shown that in more perfectly preserved specimens\r\neach leaf-scar bears three small dots. A specimen from Ireland in the\r\nBritish Museum[619] illustrates the dichotomous branching and the\r\nlongitudinal wrinkling of the bark; the leaf-scars are 2 mm. broad and\r\n2·5 mm. deep.\r\n\r\nNathorst[620] has described some examples in which the leaf-scars\r\noccur on the lower instead of on the upper end of the leaf-cushions;\r\nthese and other specimens with obscure surface-features he suggests\r\nmay be underground axes, comparable in habit with _Stigmaria_ though\r\nnot identical as regards details. It is pointed out that the absence\r\nor scarcity of _Stigmaria_ in the Bear Island beds renders it unlikely\r\nthat _Bothrodendron_ bore typical Stigmaria branches. F. E. Weiss[621]\r\nhas recently described root-bearing organs possessing primary xylem\r\nidentical with that of _Bothrodendron mundum_; while closely resembling\r\n_Stigmaria ficoides_ in certain anatomical characters, they clearly\r\nrepresent a distinct type. This discovery of a Stigmaria-like axis\r\nalmost certainly belonging to _Bothrodendron_ is consistent with\r\nNathorst’s views on some of the Bothrodendron impressions from Bear\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nInformation as to the cones of this species is restricted to a\r\ndescription by Schimper[622] of a specimen in the Dublin Museum as\r\n_Lepidostrobus Bailyanus_; this has sporophylls with a subtriangular\r\nbase bearing several megaspores and terminating distally in a slender\r\nlamina 12 cm. in length.\r\n\r\nAn example of a _Bothrodendron_ with more prominent leaf-cushions than\r\nthose already mentioned is afforded by a species from Bear Island\r\ndescribed by Heer[623] as _Lepidodendron Wükianum_ and afterwards\r\nreferred by Nathorst[624] to _Bothrodendron_. The same type is recorded\r\nalso by Schmalhausen[625] from Lower Carboniferous or Devonian strata\r\nof Siberia. Certain Scotch specimens from the Calciferous Sandstone,\r\nwhich Kidston[626] referred to Heer’s species, are regarded by Nathorst\r\nand, in part at least, by Weiss[627] and Sterzel as representing\r\na distinct species which these authors designate _Bothrodendron\r\nKidstoni_[628].\r\n\r\nWithout attempting the hopeless task of discriminating between\r\nthe various Carboniferous and Devonian specimens described under\r\nthe names _Cyclostigma_ or _Bothrodendron_, reference may be made\r\nto the following records as illustrating the wide distribution of\r\nthe genus. Schmalhausen[629] records _Cyclostigma kiltorkense_\r\nfrom Siberian rocks assigned to the Ursa stage (Devonian or Lower\r\nCarboniferous). The fossil described by Dawson[630] from the Devonian\r\nof Gaspé as _Cyclostigma densifolium_ probably represents a badly\r\npreserved example of _Bothrodendron_: Weiss’s species _Cyclostigma\r\nhercynium_[631] from Lower Devonian rocks of the Hartz district\r\nmay be identical with _Bothrodendron kiltorkense_. The supposed\r\nidentity of the latter species with _Dechenia Roemeriana_ Goepp., as\r\ndescribed by Potonié[632], appears to require confirmation[633], but\r\nif this author is correct the connexion demonstrates the continuity\r\nof Bothrodendron shoots and Stigmaria-like subterranean organs. The\r\nspecimens described from South Africa, from strata which may be\r\ncorrelated with the Upper or possibly with the Lower Carboniferous\r\nseries of Europe, as _Bothrodendron Leslei_[634] in all probability\r\nrepresents a species closely allied to the Irish and Bear Island\r\ntype. _Bothrodendron Leslei_ named after Mr Leslie whose discoveries\r\nin the Carboniferous Sandstone of Vereeniging (Transvaal) have added\r\nconsiderably to our knowledge of the South African Palaeozoic types,\r\nis represented by imperfectly preserved casts characterised by more or\r\nless circular scars displaying the same irregularity of arrangement\r\nas in _Bothrodendron kiltorkense_. The leaf-scars appear to have\r\nonly one small pit, but this may not be an original feature. The\r\nidentification of this plant as _Bothrodendron_ receives support from\r\nthe discovery of rather more satisfactory specimens at Witteberg sent\r\nto me for examination by Dr Schwarz[635]. These fossils bear a striking\r\nresemblance to _B. kiltorkense_. _Cydostigma australe_[636] Feist.\r\ndescribed from the Lower Carboniferous rocks of New South Wales, though\r\ntoo imperfectly preserved to refer with confidence to _B. kiltorkense_,\r\nis no doubt a closely allied type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 214. _Bothrodendron Leslei_ Seward.\r\n\r\n  _b._ Natural size.\r\n  _a, c._ Slightly enlarged.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 215. _Bothrodendron mundum_ (Will.).\r\n\r\n  A, B.

From a section in Dr Kidston’s Collection.]\r\n\r\nReference was made in Volume I. (p. 133) to the so-called paper coal\r\nof Carboniferous age from Central Russia, which consists of masses of\r\nthin strips of cuticle of Bothrodendron stems. The figures published\r\nby Zeiller[637] show that the plant possessed an epidermis consisting\r\nof polygonal cells interrupted by spirally disposed gaps marking the\r\nposition of leaves; the gaps measure 0·5–1·5 mm. in breadth and agree,\r\ntherefore, with the size of the leaf-scars of the smaller forms of\r\n_Bothrodendron_. The specimens from the Russian mines were first\r\nfigured by Trautschold and Auerbach[638] as _Lepidodendron tenerrimum_\r\nand afterwards referred by Zeiller to _Bothrodendron punctatum_[639].\r\nNathorst[640], however, states that an examination of the Russian\r\nmaterial leads him to retain the name originally proposed; he records\r\nthe same type from Upper Devonian rocks of Spitzbergen. The chief\r\ninterest of these Russian specimens is their manner of preservation,\r\nwhich Renault has described as the result of bacterial action; he\r\nclaims to have recognised the actual bacteria associated with the\r\ncuticular membranes[641].\r\n\r\n\r\n           _Anatomy of vegetative shoots_ of Bothrodendron.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 Williamson[642] described several specimens of petrified\r\nshoots from the Coal-Measures of Halifax which he named _Lepidodendron\r\nmundum_: these are now known to be branches of a _Bothrodendron_. The\r\ndiscovery was made by Mr Lomax[643] who found specimens showing the\r\nexternal characters of _Bothrodendron_ and the anatomical characters\r\nof _Lepidodendron mundum_. In some of the smaller twigs, the stele\r\nconsists of a solid core of xylem with external protoxylem; but in\r\nthe majority of specimens the centre of the xylem is replaced by\r\nparenchymatous tissue, either as a small axial strand or, as in the\r\nspecimen shown in fig. 215, D, a wide pith, the elements of which\r\nare arranged in regular vertical series. A diagrammatic section of\r\na small axis is represented in fig. 215, A: this branch, 2 mm. in\r\ndiameter, is composed of a broad outer cortex consisting exclusively of\r\nprimary tissue the outer cells of which are smaller and have thicker\r\nwalls than the more internal elements. The leaf-traces, _lt_, are\r\naccompanied by a strand of delicate tissue, the parichnos. The stele\r\nis almost solid; the tissues in contact with the xylem have not been\r\npreserved but the inner cortex is represented by a few layers of small\r\nparenchymatous cells, _c_¹. The larger section shown in fig. 215,\r\nD, was cut from a specimen from Dulesgate of which the smooth surface\r\nexhibits the characteristic leaf-scars of _Bothrodendron_. The section\r\nmeasures 3 cm. in its longest diameter and the stele has a breadth of\r\n3 mm. The outer cortex has a smooth surface and is composed of rather\r\nthick-walled cells succeeded by a zone of secondary elements. The\r\nmiddle cortex has disappeared and the space is partially occupied by\r\nStigmarian rootlets, _s_, and crushed patches of cortical tissue. The\r\nposition of a leaf-scar is seen at _a_; this is more clearly shown in\r\nthe enlarged drawing fig. E.\r\n\r\nIn his account of _Lepidodendron mundum_, Williamson[644] described\r\na section in which the primary wood is surrounded by a considerable\r\nthickness of secondary xylem; a diagram of this is shown in fig. 215,\r\nC. An examination of the section led me to compare the structure of\r\nthe outer cortical cells, characterised by radial rows of tangentially\r\nelongated elements, with the outer cortex of _Stigmaria_. It has\r\nrecently been shown by Weiss[645] that this and other similar sections\r\npresent several points of agreement with _Stigmaria_, particularly\r\nwith _Stigmaria Brardi_ as described by Renault. At _s_ in fig. 215,\r\nC, a vascular strand is seen passing through the outer cortex; this is\r\nalmost certainly the bundle of a rootlet: in the sections described by\r\nWeiss rootlets are shown in a similar position. The chief anatomical\r\nfeatures of the Stigmaria-like organs of _Bothrodendron_ are:—the\r\nconsiderable development of secondary xylem, the structure of the\r\nouter cortex, which is practically identical with that of _Stigmaria\r\nficoides_, and the association of groups of short transfusion tracheids\r\nwith the bundles of the rootlets. It is very probable that the absence\r\nof secondary xylem in the vegetative shoots of _Bothrodendron_ is\r\nmerely an accident and not a real distinction between the aerial and\r\nsubterranean branches of the plant; a supposition rendered probable by\r\nthe occurrence of secondary xylem in the axis of the cone described\r\nby Watson. As Weiss points out, there are certain differences between\r\nthe true _Stigmaria_ and the corresponding organ of _Bothrodendron_;\r\nthe secondary xylem in _Bothrodendron_ is not broken up by broad\r\nmedullary rays as in the common _Stigmaria_, and in _Bothrodendron_ the\r\noccurrence of a ring of primary xylem is another peculiarity.\r\n\r\nIn the vegetative shoots of _Bothrodendron mundum_ the stele differs\r\nfrom those of _Lepidodendron_ in the narrower primary xylem ring and\r\nin the large size of the metaxylem tracheae; from _Lepidodendron\r\nHarcourtii_ and _L. fuliginosum_ the xylem is distinguished by its\r\nsmoother outer face which consists of numerous narrow xylem elements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 216. _Bothrostrobus._ _l_, ligule. (After Watson.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cones_ of Bothrodendron (_Bothrostrobus_[646]).\r\n\r\nThe long and narrow cones referred to _Bothrodendron minutifolium_ from\r\nEnglish and French Coal-Measures are known only as impressions and it\r\nis not possible to say whether they were heterosporous or homosporous;\r\nthe drawing given by Zeiller (Fig. 212, E) shows that the sporangia\r\nwere of the same form as those in _Lepidostrobus_, but we have no\r\nmore exact information as to their morphology. A recently published\r\ndescription of a petrified strobilus by Mr Watson affords a welcome\r\naddition to our knowledge. There is little doubt that this cone was\r\nborne by a species of _Bothrodendron_; the evidence for this conclusion\r\nis supplied by the agreement of the anatomical characters of the stele\r\nwith that of the vegetative shoots originally described by Williamson\r\nas _Lepidodendron mundum_ and by the constant association of the cones\r\nand vegetative shoots. In 1880 Williamson described a crushed cone\r\ncontaining both megaspores and microspores which he spoke of as “a\r\ndiminutive organism, reminding us more of the dwarfed fruits of many\r\nliving Selaginellas than of the large _Lepidostrobi_[647].” Watson’s\r\nspecimens enable us to give a more complete account of this type. The\r\naxis of the strobilus bears short sporophylls bent upwards into a\r\ndistal limb with a conspicuous ligule in a deep pit beyond the shortly\r\nstalked sporangium. The length of the strobilus is estimated at 10 mm.;\r\nthe stele is of the same type as that of _Bothrodendron mundum_, but\r\nit differs from the specimens of the vegetative shoots so far found\r\nin having some secondary xylem. As shown in the sketch reproduced in\r\nfig. 216 each sporophyll is characterised by two tangentially placed\r\ngrooves, _g_, on the lower face, and by numerous transfusion tracheids,\r\n_tr_, above the vascular bundle, _vb_, immediately below the ligule,\r\n_l_. Megasporangia and microsporangia occur on the same cone, the\r\nmegasporangia being on the lower sporophylls and containing a single\r\ntetrad of megaspores. Fig. 219, E, shows a radial longitudinal section\r\nof a microsporophyll bearing a sporangium on the adaxial side of the\r\nligule, _l_, below which is the single vascular bundle and a group of\r\nshort tracheids at _t_. The sporangia closely resemble those of species\r\nof _Selaginella_ and _Lycopodium_ and, as pointed out by Watson[648],\r\nthey also recall the sporangia of the Palaeozoic genus _Spencerites_.\r\n_Bothrostrobus_ is distinguished from _Spencerites_ by the presence\r\nof a ligule, by the structure of the axis, and by the different\r\nform of the sporophylls. The occurrence of four spores only in the\r\nmegasporangia is another character in which the extinct type resembles\r\nrecent Lycopods. It is impossible to decide whether Watson’s cone\r\nrepresents a more or a less primitive type than _Lepidostrobus_: if we\r\naccept Professor Bower’s views in regard to the evolution of vegetative\r\norgans by the sterilisation of sporogenous tissue, we should probably\r\nplace _Lepidostrobus_ lower in the series than _Bothrostrobus_; but\r\nthe greater resemblance between the fertile and vegetative shoots of\r\n_Bothrodendron_, as compared with the more pronounced difference in the\r\ncase of _Lepidodendron_, may be regarded as an argument in favour of\r\nrecognising _Bothrodendron_ as the more primitive type.\r\n\r\nAnother possible example of a _Bothrodendron_ cone has been described\r\nby Nathorst from Spitzbergen as _Lepidostrobus_ _Zeilleri_[649]; this\r\nappears to consist of an axis bearing spirally disposed sporangia\r\nwithout any indication of sporophylls. This strobilus may belong to\r\n_Bothrodendron tenerrimum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pinakodendron_.\r\n\r\nThe name _Pinakodendron_[650] was instituted by the late Prof. Weiss\r\nfor a type of stem closely resembling _Bothrodendron_ but differing in\r\nthe presence of a fine reticulation on the outer bark and in the form\r\nof the leaf-scars. Weiss’s genus has been recognised by Kidston in\r\nDumfriesshire but our knowledge of the plant is as yet based solely on\r\na few small specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Omphalophloios_ (_a genus of uncertain systematic position_).\r\n\r\nFigs. 193, C, 217.\r\n\r\nThis generic name was instituted by White[651] for certain specimens of\r\nlarge stems originally described by Lesquereux from the Coal-Measures\r\nof North America as _Lepidodendron mammillatum_ and _L. cyclostigma_.\r\nThe photograph reproduced in fig. 193, C, for which I am indebted to\r\nDr Kidston[652], represents a specimen described by him from the Upper\r\nCoal-Measures of Somerset as _Omphalophloios anglicus_, and identified\r\nwith _Lepidodendron anglicum_ of Sternberg.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the impression shown in fig. 193, C, is characterised\r\nby clearly defined rhomboidal areas or cushions (fig. 217, E) like\r\nthose of _Lepidodendron_, except in the absence of a median keel,\r\nand similar to those on some forms of _Sigillaria Brardi_. A short\r\ndistance above the centre of each cushion is an oval or subcordate\r\nregion bounded by a rim-like margin and containing a small oval scar,\r\npresumably that of a vascular strand. A triangular elevation which also\r\nshows a small pit (Fig. 217, E, _a_) occurs below the oval area. The\r\nappearance of the surface-features varies considerably on different\r\nparts of a single specimen. Fig. 217, D, represents one of the numerous\r\nfigures published by White in his detailed account of the American\r\nmaterial. Each cushion bears a widely open =V=-shaped ridge, which is\r\ndescribed as a leaf-scar; above this is an oval area (2·5 mm. × 1·75\r\nmm.), the surface of which is bounded by a narrow rim. Within the rim\r\nis a smaller concave oval region with a small pit near its upper end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 217. _Omphalophloios._\r\n\r\n  D. After White. E. After Kidston.]\r\n\r\nWe cannot, in the absence of petrified material, arrive at any\r\nsatisfactory conclusion as to the meaning of these surface-features.\r\nWhite considers that _Omphalophloios_ is probably a rhizome of one of\r\nthe arborescent Lycopods, but whether or not this is its true nature\r\nmust be left for future discoveries. The fact that the rootlet bundles\r\nof some Stigmarian axes are accompanied by a parichnos strand, as Weiss\r\nhas shown, may prepare us for the discovery of surface-features on\r\n_Stigmariae_ not unlike those of _Omphalophloios_. (Fig. 193, C.)\r\n\r\nA possible comparison may be suggested also with _Sigillaria Brardi_\r\nas figured by Germar (fig. 196, A) in which circular scars, which may\r\nbe the scars of rootlets, occur below the leaf-base areas. It is not\r\nimpossible that in the surface-features of _Omphalophloios_ we have\r\nboth leaf and rootlet scars represented.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General considerations._\r\n\r\nThe solid xylem core characteristic of the stele of some species of\r\nPalaeozoic Lycopodiales (e.g. _Lepidodendron esnostense_ and _L.\r\nrhodumnense_) may probably, as Tansley and Chick[653] point out, be\r\nregarded as the lineal descendant of a primitive axial strand of\r\nwater-conducting elements. In the course of evolution the centre of the\r\ntracheal column became partially converted into parenchymatous tissue,\r\nas in _Lepidodendron vasculare_. The arrangement of the short cells\r\nin regular vertical series is reminiscent of an early stage in the\r\ndevelopment of tracheae: instead of forming tubular conducting elements\r\nthe central part of the stelar meristem acquired the short-celled form;\r\nsome of the cells became lignified as isodiametric storage tracheae\r\nwhile others persisted as thin-walled parenchyma.\r\n\r\nThe production of secondary xylem and an increase in the girth of the\r\nwhole stem led to reduction in the amount of centripetally developed\r\nconducting channels. Some of these assumed a new rôle and a shape in\r\nharmony with their functions. A later stage is represented by a further\r\nencroachment of the central parenchyma on the cylinder of centripetal\r\nxylem, as seen in _Lepidodendron Harcourtii_ and other species. The\r\nnext stage is afforded by ribless species of _Sigillaria_ in which\r\nthe primary xylem is broken up into separate conducting strands. As\r\nKidston[654] reminds us, it is in the geologically more recent species\r\nof _Sigillaria_, such as _S. Brardi_, which persist into the Permian\r\nera, that this more extreme case of reduction occurs. The older genus\r\n_Lepidodendron_ seems to have retained to the last the complete\r\ncylinder of primary xylem. In the stele of _Stigmaria_, the rhizome of\r\n_Sigillaria_ and of _Lepidodendron_, reduction of the centripetal xylem\r\nhas passed beyond the stage represented by the broken cylinder of the\r\nribless Sigillarias. With the exception of the examples described by\r\nRenault[655] and by Weiss[656], _Stigmaria_ is characterised by little\r\nor no centripetal primary xylem. It is, however, noteworthy that\r\nRenault’s _Stigmaria_, in which centripetal xylem forms a prominent\r\nfeature, is attributed to _Sigillaria Brardi_, a species in which the\r\nvascular cylinder of the aerial stem illustrates a later and not an\r\nearlier phase in the replacement of centripetal by centrifugal wood.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, as Lady Isabel Browne[657] says, that most Stigmarian\r\naxes had reached a more advanced stage in specialisation than is shown\r\nin the stelar structure of the aerial shoots. The relatively greater\r\nand probably the more precocious development of secondary xylem in\r\n_Stigmaria_ than in _Lepidodendron_ or _Sigillaria_ may have some\r\nsignificance in relation to the smaller amount of “old wood[658]” (in a\r\nphylogenetic sense) in their steles.\r\n\r\nAs is pointed out in a later chapter, recent researches into the\r\nanatomy of extinct members of the Osmundaceae by Kidston and\r\nGwynne-Vaughan have brought to light a striking parallelism in\r\nevolutionary sequence between the Lepidodendreae and the ancestors of\r\n_Osmunda_ and _Todea_, the two surviving genera of one of the most\r\nancient families of ferns.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt as to a very close relationship between\r\n_Sigillaria_, _Lepidodendron_, and _Bothrodendron_. _Sigillaria_ seems\r\nto have outlived _Lepidodendron_ and _Bothrodendron_. The two latter\r\ngenera are recorded from Upper Devonian rocks in several localities,\r\n_Bothrodendron_ being particularly abundant in the pre-Carboniferous\r\nfloras of Bear Island and other parts of the world. A remarkable\r\nstem described by Dr White[659] as _Archaeosigillaria primaeva_ from\r\nUpper Devonian shales of New York is spoken of by him as “one of the\r\nmost highly developed representatives of a fairly distinct archaic\r\ngroup foreshadowing the later genera _Bothrodendron_, _Sigillaria_,\r\n_Lepidodendron_ and _Lepidophloios_.” The type-specimen, when first\r\ndiscovered, consisted of an apparently unbranched stem reaching a\r\nlength of 5 metres. From the swollen basal part Stigmaria-like\r\nrootlets spread into the surrounding shale. At a higher level the\r\nfissured bark shows indistinctly defined leaf-cushions which pass\r\ngradually upwards into cushions and scars arranged in closer order\r\non regular vertical ribs. The surface-features in this region are\r\npractically those of a ribbed _Sigillaria_. Traced farther upwards the\r\nvertical ribs die out and cushions of the Lepidodendroid form cover\r\nthe surface of the bark. The leaf-scars, with a supraposed ligular\r\npit and two vertically elongated parichnos-scars, are said to bear\r\na closer resemblance to those of _Sigillaria_ and _Bothrodendron_\r\nthan to the leaf-areas of _Lepidodendron_. Nothing is known as to the\r\nanatomy of this stem, nor have fertile shoots been discovered. In the\r\nabsence of more trustworthy evidence than is available conclusions of a\r\nphylogenetic nature must be accepted at their true value. It is however\r\nlegitimate to describe _Archaeosigillaria primaeva_ as one of the\r\noldest examples of a lycopodiaceous plant which shows well-preserved\r\nexternal features, and these are of exceptional interest as indicating\r\na combination of generic characters. This Devonian type lends support\r\nto the view that _Lepidodendron_ and _Sigillaria_ are offshoots,\r\ndiffering from one another in comparatively unimportant points, from a\r\ncommon ancestral type.\r\n\r\nThe generally accepted statement that arborescent Palaeozoic\r\nLycopodiales bore their sporangia on specially modified leaves\r\n(sporophylls) grouped in cones which were usually produced at the tip\r\nof slender branches, has recently shared the fate of most rules. Prof.\r\nBower in his _Origin of a Land Flora_ mentions a Belgian specimen of\r\n_Pinakodendron musivum_ Weiss from the Westphalian series (Middle\r\nCoal-Measures), to be described by Dr Kidston, which bore its sporangia\r\n“associated with the leaves of certain portions of the stem, without\r\nany cone-formation. The fertile and sterile portions are distinguished\r\nonly by the presence or absence of sporangia[660].”\r\n\r\n_Lepidodendron_ and _Sigillaria_ can hardly be claimed as the direct\r\nancestors of any existing type of Lycopodiales, but while exhibiting\r\npoints of contact with _Lycopodium_, _Selaginella_, and _Psilotum_ they\r\nare perhaps more closely allied to _Isoetes_.\r\n\r\nLady Isabel Browne[661], who has recently published an excellent\r\nsummary of the evidence on the relation of the Lepidodendreae to\r\n_Isoetes_, concludes her examination of the arguments by expressing the\r\nopinion that there is a strong probability of the correctness of the\r\nview that _Isoetes_ may be derived “from the Lepidodendraceae in the\r\nwidest sense of the word.” This decision seems to me to accord best\r\nwith the facts.\r\n\r\nThe further question as to the relation of these Palaeozoic genera to\r\nplants higher in the scale must be reserved for fuller consideration\r\nin another volume. An attempt will also be made to consider how far\r\nanatomical structure may be used as a guide to the conditions under\r\nwhich _Lepidodendron_ and _Sigillaria_ as well as other members of\r\nthe Permo-Carboniferous floras passed their lives. The secondary\r\nxylem of _Lepidodendron_ and _Sigillaria_ affords a striking example\r\nof water-conducting tissue of homogeneous structure comparable\r\nwith the wood of Conifers rather than with that of Angiosperms. It\r\nwas presumably formed, for the most part, under uniform climatic\r\nconditions: the absence of rings of growth points to uninterrupted\r\nsupply to evergreen shoots exposed to no alternation of activity and\r\narrested growth. Attention has already been called to the absence of\r\nany tissue corresponding to secondary phloem. Even in young shoots of\r\n_Lepidodendron_, no tissue has been found external to the meristematic\r\nzone agreeing in the form of its elements with the channels through\r\nwhich the elaborated food is conveyed from the leaves of recent plants\r\nto the regions of cell-building. That the ‘secretory zone’ may have\r\nserved this purpose, at least in young stems, is not improbable. On\r\nthe other hand, it is difficult to understand why older Lepidodendron\r\nstems show no indication of additions to the secretory zone. If this\r\ntissue served for the transport of proteids we should expect to find\r\nprovision made for its constant renewal _pari passu_ with the secondary\r\ngrowth of the xylem. The conclusion seems to me inevitable that the\r\nsupply of building-material was otherwise provided for than in recent\r\nvascular plants. The physiological division of labour may have been\r\nless complete in the tissue-systems of the Palaeozoic Lycopods than\r\nin the more highly specialised organs of such an extinct genus\r\nas _Lyginodendron_ or than in recent plants. Our knowledge of the\r\nanatomical structure of many extinct types has already reached a stage\r\nwhen we should take greater heed of the _modus operandi_ of the complex\r\nmachinery revealed by a study of petrified stems. From the known we\r\nproceed to interpret the unknown; but there is a danger of neglecting\r\nthe possibilities of evolution during the countless ages which separate\r\nthe forests of the Coal period from those of the present era. We may\r\neasily allow preconceived ideas to warp our judgment in attempting\r\nto distribute the manifold activities which made up the life of a\r\n_Lepidodendron_ among the structural units of the plant-body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n            =Seed-bearing plants closely allied to members\r\n                         of the Lycopodiales.=\r\n\r\n\r\n                          i. _Lepidocarpon._\r\n\r\nIn 1877 Williamson[662] published an account of some fossil seeds which\r\nhe referred to Brongniart’s genus _Cardiocarpon_[663], a generic title\r\nfor certain Gymnospermous seeds. Some of these he identified, on the\r\nauthority of the author of the species, with _Cardiocarpon anomalum_\r\nCarruthers[664]. Several years later Wild and Lomax described a new\r\ntype of strobilus from the Lower Coal-Measures of Lancashire[665].\r\nThe result of this discovery and of the subsequent examination by\r\nScott of additional material, was to establish the fact that the seeds\r\ndescribed by Williamson and generally accepted as Gymnospermous, are\r\nin reality sporangia belonging to a Lycopodiaceous cone. The seeds to\r\nwhich Carruthers gave the name _Cardiocarpon anomalum_ are, however,\r\ndistinct from those described under the same name by Williamson and\r\nare those of a true Gymnosperm. For this seed-bearing strobilus\r\nScott[666] instituted the generic name _Lepidocarpon_, which he thus\r\ndefined: “Strobili, with the characters of _Lepidostrobus_, but each\r\nmegasporangium was inclosed, when mature, in an integument, growing\r\nup from the superior face of the sporophyll-pedicel. Integument,\r\ntogether with the lamina of the sporophyll, completely enveloping\r\nthe megasporangium, or nucellus, leaving only an elongated, slit-like\r\nmicropyle above. A single functional megaspore or embryo-sac developed\r\nin each megasporangium, occupying almost the whole of its cavity.\r\nMegaspore ultimately filled by the prothallus or endosperm. Sporophyll,\r\ntogether with the integumented megasporangium and its contents,\r\ndetached entire from the axis of the strobilus, the whole forming a\r\nclosed, seed-like, reproductive body. Seed-like organ horizontally\r\nelongated, in the direction of the sporophyll-pedicel, to which the\r\nmicropylar crevice is parallel.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lepidocarpon Lomaxi_, Scott. Fig. 218.\r\n\r\nAn immature cone of _L. Lomaxi_ is practically identical with a\r\n_Lepidostrobus_; its sporangia are naked and only acquire their\r\ninteguments at a later stage. A mature strobilus has a diameter of at\r\nleast 3 cm. and is about 4 cm. in length. As in typical _Lepidostrobi_,\r\nthe axis bears spirally disposed sporophylls, and each sporophyll has a\r\nlong narrow pedicel approximately at right angles to the cone axis with\r\nits distal end expanded into a broad and thick lamina (fig. 218, B).\r\n\r\nAt the distal end the pedicel has a thin marginal wing (fig. 218, C,\r\nright-hand half) continuous with the upturned protective lamina. To the\r\nupper face of each sporophyll is attached along the whole length as far\r\nas the ligule, a single large sporangium; on each side of the base of\r\nthe sporangium the sporophyll forms a supporting cushion. The relation\r\nof the sporangium to the ligule, _l_, is shown in fig. 218, B, and in\r\nthe tangential section, C, which illustrates the triangular form of the\r\nsporangium near its distal end.\r\n\r\nIn mature cones, the sporangia assumed the form of seeds, the change\r\nbeing due to the growth of an investing integument from the upper\r\nface of the sporophylls on each side of the sporangia. Fig. 218, A,\r\nillustrates the form of a sporangium as shown in tangential sections;\r\nthe vascular bundle is seen below the base of the sporangium and the\r\ngaps right and left of it probably mark the position of parichnos\r\nstrands. On each side of the sporangium, _b_, a fairly thick wall of\r\ntissue has grown up from the sporophyll, forming an integument which\r\novertops the apical ridge of the sporangium, leaving a narrow micropyle\r\nin the form of a long crevice (_m_, fig. 218, B). At the proximal\r\nend of the sporangium the integument forms an enclosing wall; at the\r\ndistal end it abuts on and is continuous with the upturned end of the\r\nsporophyll. It is clearly established by Scott that the tissue which\r\ninvests the sporangia is not the upturned margins of the sporophyll,\r\nbut a new formation fully entitled to the designation integument. It\r\nis noteworthy that the integument is not developed until a late stage\r\nin the ontogeny of the strobilus; it is not formed until after the\r\nproduction of the prothallus[667]. The diagrammatic sketch, fig.\r\n218, B, shows the relation of the integument to the sporophyll and\r\nsporangium, the outline of the latter being indicated by a broken\r\nline. The columnar wall of the sporangium (fig. 218, A, _b_) forms a\r\nclosed beak within the micropylar crevice, and in the interior of the\r\nsporangial cavity the slightly shrivelled membrane, _a_, represents the\r\nsingle megaspore; traces of the aborted sister-cells of the megaspore\r\nare occasionally met with. Scott describes a specimen in which the\r\nmegaspore is filled with tissue agreeing in appearance with the\r\nprothallus in a megaspore of _Isoetes_ or _Selaginella_; no undoubted\r\narchegonia or female organs have been discovered, nor has any spore\r\nbeen found containing an embryo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 218. _Lepidocarpon Lomaxi_, Scott.\r\n\r\n  A and C. After Scott.\r\n  B. Diagram of a single sporophyll: _m_, micropyle; _St_, stele.]\r\n\r\nThe axis of _L. Lomaxi_ has a medullated stele constructed on the same\r\nplan as that of some species of _Lepidodendron_ and _Lepidostrobus_;\r\nthe vascular bundles supplying the sporophylls pass obliquely upwards\r\nand outwards from the stele, _St_, fig. 218, B, and bend slightly\r\ndownward just before entering the pedicel of a sporophyll.\r\n\r\nDr Scott has also described a strobilus containing microsporangia\r\npartially enclosed by a rudimentary integument. It is, however, of\r\nconsiderable interest to find a partial development in the case of a\r\nmale flower of an integumentary outgrowth, which it would seem could\r\nonly be of real functional importance in the female shoot.\r\n\r\nIt is important to notice that specimens of a second species of\r\n_Lepidocarpon_, _L. Wildianum_, are recorded from Lower Carboniferous\r\nbeds of Scotland, a fact which points to a considerable antiquity for\r\nthis seed-bearing Lycopodiaceous type[668].\r\n\r\nThe most important question to consider in regard to _Lepidocarpon_\r\nis—are we justified in applying to the integumented sporangia the term\r\nseed? The megaspore was not set free as it is in recent Pteridophytes,\r\nsuch as _Azolla_ and other genera with which _Lepidocarpon_ may be\r\ncompared; it was on the other hand retained in the sporangium, as\r\nmay sometimes happen even in recent species of _Selaginella_ (cf.\r\nfig. 131, D). Moreover, the megaspore is characterised by a thin\r\nenclosing membrane in contrast to the thick coat of a spore which\r\nis destined to be shed. The peculiar slit-like form of the micropyle\r\nis a distinguishing feature, but this may be readily explained as\r\na convenient form in the case of a radially elongated sporangium.\r\nThe absence of an embryo, though a distinguishing feature of\r\n_Lepidocarpon_, cannot be held to be a serious obstacle to the use of\r\nthe term seed; in recent Cycads the embryo, as Scott points out, may\r\nnot begin to develope until the seed has been shed. It is possible that\r\nthe seeds of _Lepidocarpon_ were not pollinated on the parent plant.\r\n\r\nThe lesson which this extinct type teaches, is that certain\r\nLycopodiaceous plants of the Palaeozoic era had reached an important\r\nstage in the evolution of a seed. The morphological essentials of true\r\nseeds had been acquired; but we do not know the biological conditions\r\nunder which pollination and fertilisation were effected. Another point\r\nof considerable interest is the value of this discovery as an argument\r\nin favour of the view that some Gymnosperms are derived from Lycopod\r\nancestors. Leaving the general question until later, it may at any rate\r\nbe stated that in _Lepidocarpon_ we have a demonstration of the fact\r\nthat the Lycopodiales were not always distinguished from Gymnosperms\r\nby the absence of seeds. There are certain features in _Lepidocarpon_\r\nshared by the seeds of Araucarieae[669] which may well mean something\r\nmore than mere parallel development in two distinct phyla of the\r\nplant-kingdom[670].\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ii. _Miadesmia._\r\n\r\nIn 1894 Prof. Bertrand[671] published an account of certain fragments\r\nof petrified leaves and twigs of a small herbaceous Lycopodiaceous\r\nplant, under the name _Miadesmia membranacea_, which he discovered\r\nin English material in association with _Lepidodendron Harcourtii_.\r\nSubsequently Scott recognised the megasporophylls of the same plant,\r\nand microsporophylls have also been discovered. The most complete\r\naccount of _Miadesmia_ so far published we owe to Dr Benson[672],\r\nwhose description is based on specimens from several sources.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Miadesmia membranacea_, Bertrand.

Radial section of microsporophyll of _Bothrodendron_. (From a\r\n     section in the Manchester Museum; Hick Collection R. 406.)]\r\n\r\nThe slender stem, characterised by unequal dichotomy, has a single\r\nprotostele composed of scalariform tracheids with 3–6 peripheral\r\nprotoxylem groups. A zone of delicate tissue surrounds the xylem; this\r\nis described as phloem, but it is not clear whether the designation\r\nis based on histological characters or primarily on its position.\r\nThe cortex consists of an inner lacunar tissue and an outer region\r\nlimited by a small-celled superficial layer sharply contrasted with\r\nthe underlying layers of larger cells. The stem of _Miadesmia_ is not\r\nuncommon in sections of the Lancashire calcareous nodules, and may be\r\nrecognised by the delicate crushed tissue of which it mainly consists\r\nand by large hypodermal parenchyma. The spirally disposed leaves bear\r\na conspicuous and relatively large ligule, 3 mm. long, in a deep pit\r\n(fig. 219, B and C) roofed over by a few layers of tissue corresponding\r\nto the velum in _Isoetes_ (cf. fig. 133, E, _v_). The fairly thick\r\ncentral region of the lamina is expanded laterally into thin wings,\r\nwhich in the living state probably bore delicate hairs. These delicate\r\nleaves, apparently without stomata, were attached to the stem at an\r\nacute angle, and Miss Benson suggests that their form and arrangement\r\nmay have enabled them to hold water by surface-tension. As seen in\r\nfig. 219, B, C, which represents part of a transverse section near the\r\nleaf-base, the ligule is a very characteristic feature, and the size\r\nof the single vein is in keeping with the almost filmy nature of the\r\nlamina.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the sections in British collections, I have been\r\nenabled by the kindness of Prof. Bertrand to see photomicrographs of\r\nthe sections on which he founded the genus. One of these sections,\r\ntransverse to the stem and leaves, illustrates in a striking manner the\r\nrelatively large size of the leaves and ligules in proportion to the\r\ndelicate axis of the shoot.\r\n\r\nThe megasporangiate cone has an axis which agrees in its structure\r\nwith that of the vegetative stem and bears several megasporophylls\r\napproximately at right-angles. As in the foliage leaves, the ligule\r\nis prominent and large, and lies in a groove which contains also\r\nthe megasporangium; both ligule, _l_, and sporangium, _s_, as seen\r\nin the transverse section represented in fig. 219, D, are covered\r\nby an integument or velum which arises in the proximal part of the\r\nleaf and leaves a circular micropylar opening at the beak-like apex\r\nof the sporangium. The circular micropyle is surrounded by numerous\r\nhairs borne on the integument and which presumably played the part\r\nof a feathery stigma. A single megaspore with a thin membrane, _m_,\r\nabuts on the fairly strong sporangial wall, _s_; in some cases the\r\nsporangium and megaspore walls may be indistinguishable, a feature\r\nsuggesting comparison with seed-structure. Some megaspores have\r\nbeen found filled with a prothallus. The longitudinal section shown\r\nin fig. 219, A, illustrates the characteristic horizontal position\r\nof the megasporophyll, as also the relation of the ligule, _l_, to\r\nthe sporophyll with its single vascular bundle, and to the hairy\r\nintegument, which overarches both sporangium and ligule; the line\r\n_m_ shows the position of the megaspore-membrane, detached from the\r\nsporangial wall on the upper side but in contact with it below.\r\nThe microsporophyll shown in 219, E, was originally referred to\r\n_Miadesmia_ but has since been recognised by Watson[673] as that of a\r\n_Bothrostrobus_.\r\n\r\n_Miadesmia_ affords an example of a Palaeozoic plant comparable with\r\n_Isoetes_ and _Selaginella_; it agrees also with _Lepidocarpon_ in\r\npossessing true seeds, and with Watson’s _Bothrodendron_ cone in the\r\nshape of the sporangia, which are more like those of _Selaginella_\r\nthan the radially elongated sporangia of _Lepidostrobus_. _Miadesmia_\r\nagrees with _Selaginella_, e.g. _S. spinosa_, in its stelar structure,\r\nin the form of the sporangia, and in the presence of a ligule. It\r\nis distinguished by having only one instead of four megaspores in a\r\nsporangium, in the possession of an integument which formed a close\r\ninvestment to the spore and served as a stigma (comparable with the\r\nstigma-like integument of the male flower of _Welwitschia_), and in the\r\nshedding of the megasporophylls, which have been aptly compared with\r\nwinged seeds.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LEPIDOCARPON]\r\n\r\nOn the ground of their general anatomical features _Lepidocarpon_\r\nand _Miadesmia_ are clearly entitled to be included among extinct\r\nrepresentatives of the Pteridophyta. These plants had, however,\r\ncrossed what it has been customary to regard as the boundary between\r\nPteridophytes and Phanerogams: they possessed megasporangia with the\r\nattributes of seeds. It has been suggested by Lester Ward[674] that\r\nPteridophytic seed-bearing plants shall be recognised as a distinct\r\nphylum for which he proposes the name Pteridospermaphyta, a designation\r\nimplying exclusion from the Spermatophyta as usually understood. For\r\nseed-bearing Lycopodiaceous genera he suggests the name Lepidospermae.\r\nAs knowledge of the Palaeozoic seed-plants increases revision of\r\nexisting classifications and group names will become necessary, but as\r\nyet we are hardly in a position to draw up a satisfactory scheme of\r\ngrouping; we know little of _Lepidocarpon_ as a whole and it would be\r\npremature to commit ourselves, even provisionally, to a classification\r\nwhich is based on such meagre evidence as we possess. Moreover the\r\nvalue to be attached to the seed-habit as a basis of classification can\r\nhardly be estimated until fuller information is obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n                              FILICALES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis division of the Pteridophyta includes both the true ferns\r\n(Filicineae) and the less familiar water-ferns or Hydropterideae.\r\nThe almost complete absence of satisfactory evidence in regard to\r\nthe geological history of the latter renders this group of secondary\r\nimportance from a palaeobotanical standpoint, but, on the other hand,\r\nwe possess a wealth of material bearing on the past history and\r\nrelative antiquity of the true ferns.\r\n\r\nThe study of extinct types has so far rendered no substantial help\r\ntowards bridging the wide gap between the Filicales and the lower\r\nplants. As Mr Tansley[675] says in his admirable lectures on _The\r\nEvolution of the Filicinean Vascular System_, “The biggest gap in\r\nthe plant kingdom at the present time is undoubtedly that which\r\nseparates the Pteridophytes from the plants definitely below them in\r\norganisation, and directly we try to step behind the ferns we tumble\r\ninto this abyss.” Resemblances long ago recognised between certain\r\nferns and the cycads, a section of the Gymnosperms, were regarded by\r\na few botanists as indications of blood-relationship, and the results\r\nof recent researches into the morphological characters of extinct\r\nPalaeozoic types are generally held to confirm these surmises. Prof.\r\nChodat[676] of Geneva has recently challenged the validity of the\r\narguments on which the affinity of cycads and ferns has been accepted\r\nby the great majority of botanists. Whether or not his criticisms stand\r\nthe test of unbiassed examination, they must at least lead us to\r\nsubstitute a critical consideration of the facts for a mere repetition\r\nof conclusions which appeal to our imagination. Despite Prof. Chodat’s\r\nwarning, we may still quote with confidence a phrase used in another\r\nconnexion—ferns “are links in a chain and branches on the tree of life,\r\nwith their roots in a past inconceivably remote[677].”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PTERIDOSPERMS]\r\n\r\nTransitional forms which are regarded as pointing to a common origin\r\nfor ferns and cycads are known in abundance; other types have also been\r\ndiscovered which lead some authors to go so far as to derive the whole\r\nof the seed-bearing plants from an ancestry the descendants of which\r\nare represented by existing ferns. While hesitating to allow the ferns\r\nor fern-like plants the peculiar position of universal ancestors, we\r\nmust admit that there is no group of plants with a history of greater\r\nimportance from an evolutionary standpoint than that with which we are\r\nnow concerned.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some difficulties to face in attempting to decipher\r\nthe history of the Filicineae as recorded in the earth’s crust. Few\r\nfossil plants are so familiar as the well-preserved carbonaceous\r\nimpressions of compound leaves on the shales of our Coal-Measures,\r\nwhich were referred by older authors to recent genera and species of\r\nferns and accepted by later writers as undoubted examples of Palaeozoic\r\nferns. The common belief in the dominance of ferns in Palaeozoic\r\nfloras is reflected in the novelist’s description of the Carboniferous\r\nperiod, “when the forms of plants were few and often of the fern\r\nkind[678].” We now know that very many of these Carboniferous leaves\r\nbelonged to plants differing widely in morphological characters from\r\nthe modern genera to which they exhibit so deceptive a resemblance.\r\nThese pseudo-ferns, recently christened Pteridosperms or seed-bearing\r\nfern-like plants, are dealt with in a later chapter. The discovery\r\nof this extinct group has added enormously to our knowledge of\r\nplant-evolution and at the same time has rendered much more difficult\r\nthe task of unravelling the past history of the true ferns. As soon\r\nas it was demonstrated that many familiar Palaeozoic “ferns” are not\r\nferns, some authors went far towards concluding that however close\r\nmight be the agreement between fossil and recent leaves suspicion of\r\nclose relationship must be set aside. Like the earlier writers who\r\ndescribed fossils as _lusus naturae_ fashioned by devilish agency\r\nto deceive too credulous man, the discovery of seed-bearing plants\r\nwith the foliage of ferns threatened to disturb the mental balance of\r\npalaeobotanists. The fact is, we cannot in some cases determine from\r\nleaf-form alone whether or not a fossil is a true fern; we may, as\r\nProfessor Bower[679] suggests, regard all fern-like fossils as ferns\r\nuntil they are proved to be Pteridosperms, or in a spirit of scientific\r\nscepticism, we may at once admit that many Palaeozoic fern-like\r\nleaves must await further evidence before their true position can be\r\ndetermined. It is impossible, as Zeiller[680] says, in the present\r\nstate of our knowledge to range fern-like Palaeozoic plants in two\r\ngroups, one referred to Filicineae and the other to the Pteridosperms.\r\n\r\nThe following classification of the Filicales is based on that adopted\r\nby Prof. Engler in the latest edition of his _Syllabus_[681] and on the\r\nresults of Bower’s[682] excellent work on the spore-bearing members of\r\nrecent ferns.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Filicales are characterised by the same well-marked\r\nphysiological division of labour in their vegetative parts as are the\r\nLycopods; the plant is the asexual generation (sporophyte), while the\r\nsexual generation (gametophyte) is small and inconspicuous, either\r\nan independent green prothallus or a tissue more or less completely\r\nenclosed in the spore. The large size of the leaves, which in the young\r\nstate are usually coiled like a crozier (fig. 220, A), is a striking\r\ncharacteristic of the ferns; they are megaphyllous in contrast to the\r\nmicrophylly of the Lycopods.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   I. =Leptosporangiate Filicales.=\r\n\r\nIn these homosporous and heterosporous plants the sporangia are\r\ndeveloped from single epidermal cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 220. Young fronds of (A) _Angiopteris evecta_ and\r\n  (B) _Cycas revoluta_. (Reduced.)]\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Eufilicineae._ The sporangia bear spores of one kind only; the\r\nwall of a sporangium consists of one layer of cells. In the great\r\nmajority of cases the sporangia are characterised by the possession\r\nof a conspicuous row of thick-walled brown cells, the annulus[683],\r\nwhich serves as a mechanism for dehiscence and spore-dispersal. The\r\nfertile leaves, identical in form with the sterile, or more or less\r\nsharply contrasted, usually bear the sporangia on the under surface of\r\nthe lamina in definite groups or sori, and not on the upper surface or\r\ngrouped in strobili as in the Lycopodiales. The stem is dorsiventral or\r\nradial in structure, creeping or erect, frequently clothed with chaffy\r\nscales (ramenta) and less often with multicellular hairs. The sexual\r\ngeneration is represented by a small green prothallus which lives for\r\na short period only and dies after nursing the fern-plant through its\r\nearliest stages.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Hydropterideae._ Heterosporous water-ferns differing\r\nconsiderably in habit from the true ferns. Each megasporangium\r\ncontains a single megaspore and several microspores are produced in\r\neach microsporangium. The gametophyte is represented by tissue more or\r\nless enclosed in the spore. [Genera _Salvinia_, _Azolla_, _Marsilia_,\r\n_Regnellidium_, _Pilularia_. See Chapter XXVI.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Eufilicineae._ The classification of the true ferns in common\r\nuse is based almost exclusively on the structure of the sporangium, the\r\nform and position of the sori, and on the presence or absence of an\r\nindusium (the tissue which in some ferns partially or completely covers\r\neach sorus). In recent years there has been considerable activity\r\nin the investigation of fern anatomy with a view to elucidating the\r\nnatural relationship between recent families or genera. The results\r\nof these researches are on the whole consistent with the scheme and\r\ngrouping adopted in the _Synopsis Filicum_ of Hooker and Baker and in\r\ngeneral harmony with the main conclusions arrived at by Bower from an\r\nintensive study of the development of fern sporangia. The following\r\nclassification is based on that of Bower who takes as a basis (i) the\r\nrelative time of appearance of the sporangia in a single sorus, (ii)\r\nthe structure of the sporangia and their orientation relative to the\r\nwhole sorus, (iii) the productiveness of sporangia (spore-output).\r\n\r\n  Osmundaceae      ╭ _Simplices_ (Bower).

The annulus is represented by a group of thicker-walled\r\ncells a short distance below the apex (fig. 221, C). This family\r\nstands apart among the ferns; in some respects, e.g. in the more\r\nrobust sporangia occasionally forming synangia, and in the presence\r\nof stipular wings, it forms a transitional series between the\r\nLeptosporangiate and Eusporangiate ferns. The only European species of\r\n_Osmunda_, _O. regalis_, is almost cosmopolitan in range; other species\r\noccur in North and South America, in the Far East, the Malay Peninsula,\r\nand in other regions, more especially in the temperate zones. _Todea_\r\nis represented by (i) the South African and Australian species, _T.\r\nbarbara_, a fern with a stem, which may reach a height of several feet,\r\nthickly covered with adventitious roots and bearing large and somewhat\r\nleathery fronds; (ii) filmy species in New Zealand, New South Wales,\r\nNew Caledonia, and elsewhere.

In _Platyzoma_ the leaves are simple, reaching a\r\nlength of 20–30 cm., and bear small revolute oval segments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 224.\r\n\r\n  A. _Aneimia flexuosa._\r\n  B. _A. phyllitidis._\r\n  C. _Hymenophyllum dilatatum._\r\n  D, E, F, G. _Matonia pectinata_; _i_, indusium.\r\n  H. _Thyrsopteris elegans._\r\n  I. _Gleichenia circinata._\r\n\r\n  (A, B, after Prantl; C, G, H, I, after Bower.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 225. _Gleichenia dicarpa._ (⅓ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 226.\r\n\r\n  A, B. _Gleichenites Rostafinskii_, Raciborski.\r\n  C. _Gleichenia dicarpa._ (Nat. size.)\r\n  D, E. _Gleichenia dichotoma._ (Reduced.)\r\n\r\n  (A, B, after Raciborski; C, after Hooker; D, E, after Goebel.)]\r\n\r\n_Gleichenia_ is represented by several species in the tropics and\r\nextends to south temperate and Antarctic latitudes. The species _G.\r\ndichotoma_ (= _G. linearis_) is one of the more successful tropical\r\nferns, while _G. moniliformis_ (by some authors recognised as a\r\ndistinct genus, _Stromatopteris_) is peculiar to New Caledonia. The\r\nmonotypic genus _Platyzoma_ is a xerophilous Australian fern. The\r\nGleicheniaceae are unrepresented in existing north temperate floras.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      =Matonineae.= (_Matonia._)\r\n\r\nThe genus _Matonia_, placed in the Cyatheaceae by Sir William Hooker\r\nand compared by other authors also with the Gleicheniaceae, is now\r\nincluded in a special family. The sori are circular and consist of\r\n5–11 large sporangia (fig. 224, E, G) sessile on a central columnar\r\nreceptacle which spreads out into an umbrella-like indusium (D, _i_)\r\nwith its incurved margin tucked in below the ring of sporangia. The\r\nindusium is detached when the sporangia are ripe. The annulus is\r\noblique and incomplete and often slightly sinuous; it agrees in the\r\nmain with that of _Gleichenia_. The species _Matonia pectinata_ is\r\ncharacterised by dichotomously branched fronds (figs. 227, 228) with\r\nlong and slender petioles; the pinnae bear linear pinnules with forked\r\nlateral veins and occasional lateral anastomoses (fig. 224, F). The\r\nonly other living representative is _M. sarmentosa_, discovered by Mr\r\nCharles Hose at Niah, Sarawak[688]: this species has long pendulous\r\nleaves apparently very different from those of _M. pectinata_, but\r\nthe branching of the frond may be regarded as a modification of a\r\nprimitive form of dichotomy[689]. A small bud occurs in the angle\r\nbetween the forked linear segments and the rachis, as in some species\r\nof _Gleichenia_[690]. _Matonia_ is confined to the Malay region: _M.\r\npectinata_ grows in Western Borneo and in various localities in the\r\nMalay peninsula, while _M. sarmentosa_, has been found in one locality\r\nonly; the latter species has recently been transferred to a new genus\r\n_Phanerosorus_, but in view of the practical identity in anatomical\r\nstructure and the close agreement as regards the sori of the two\r\nspecies there would seem to be no justification for this change of\r\nname[691].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 227. _Matonia pectinata._ (⅕ nat. size.) M.S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =Loxsomaceae.=\r\n\r\nThe New Zealand genus _Loxsoma_ has marginal sori with a cup-like\r\nindusium surrounding an elongated receptacle bearing pear-shaped\r\nsporangia provided with a complete oblique annulus. The genus is\r\nchiefly interesting because of its isolated position; it agrees with\r\n_Trichomanes_ (Hymenophyllaceae) in the structure of the sorus and\r\nwith species of _Dicksonia_ and _Davallia_ in habit; it shows some\r\nresemblance also to Gleicheniaceae and Schizaeaceae[692]. A new type\r\nof fern described by Christ[693] from Costa Rica as _Loxsomopsis\r\ncostaricensis_ affords a striking instance of discontinuous\r\ndistribution and emphasises the antiquity and generalised features of\r\nthe family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 228. _Matonia pectinata._ From a photograph by Mr\r\n  Tansley of a group of plants in a wood on Gunong Tundok, Mount\r\n  Ophir.]\r\n\r\n\r\n         =Hymenophyllaceae.= (_Hymenophyllum_, _Trichomanes_.)\r\n\r\nThe sporangia, which are attached to a columnar receptacle or\r\nprolongation of a vein beyond the margin of the lamina, are\r\ncharacterised by an obliquely transverse annulus (fig. 224, C). A\r\ncup-like indusium surrounds the lower portion of the receptacle which\r\nis two-lipped in _Trichomanes_ and entire in _Hymenophyllum_ (fig. 270,\r\nC, D). These two filmy ferns have a wide distribution both in tropical\r\nand extra-tropical regions; they are represented in the British\r\nIsles by _Hymenophyllum tunbrigense_, _H. Wilsoni_, and _Trichomanes\r\nradicans_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 229.\r\n\r\n  A. _Thyrsopteris elegans._    B. _Cyathea spinulosa._\r\n  C. _Davallia concinna._       D. _Dicksonia coniifolia._\r\n  E. _Alsophila excelsa._       F, G. _Dicksonia culcita._\r\n\r\n  (A, after Diels and Kunze; B, D, F, G, after Hooker; E, after\r\n     Bower.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n   =Cyatheaceae.= (_Cyathea_, _Hemitelia_, _Alsophila_, _Dicksonia_,\r\n                           _Thyrsopteris_.)\r\n\r\nThe sporangia occur in indusiate or naked sori and have an obliquely\r\nvertical and incomplete annulus (fig. 229, E). In the great majority of\r\ncases the fronds are large and highly compound, but _Cyathea sinuata_\r\nHook, a rare Ceylon species, bears simple narrow linear leaves. This\r\nfamily includes, with few exceptions, all the tree ferns[694]. The\r\nsori of _Dicksonia_ are enclosed in a two-valved indusium (fig. 229,\r\nF. G); in the species represented in fig. 230 the fertile segments,\r\nwhich terminate in cup-like indusia, are characterised by the absence\r\nof a lamina and closely resemble those of _Thyrsopteris_ (fig. 229,\r\nA). In _Cyathea_ the indusium has the form of a cup which is at first\r\nclosed and afterwards opens at the apex (fig. 229, B); in _Hemitelia_\r\nthe indusium is much reduced and in _Alsophila_ the sori are naked.\r\n_Thyrsopteris_ is characterised by the reduced fertile pinnules bearing\r\nstalked sori in deep cups (fig. 229, A). The appearance of this fern\r\n“is very remarkable, for the cup-shaped sori hang down from the\r\nfronds in masses, looking just like masses of millet seed[695].” The\r\nsporangia are described by Bower[696] as large and of rather peculiar\r\nform. As seen in fig. 224, H, the annulus is continuous; it forms a\r\ntwisted loop of cells which vary in shape and in the thickness of the\r\nwalls. The Cyatheaceae are for the most part tropical ferns with a wide\r\ngeographical range, usually in moist regions; they are, however, able\r\nto flourish under widely different temperature conditions. In Tasmania,\r\nas Diels[697] points out, tree ferns may occasionally be seen laden\r\nwith snow, and on the west coast of New Zealand they overhang the edge\r\nof a glacier[698]. The monotypic genus _Thyrsopteris_ is confined to\r\nJuan Fernandez. The Cyatheaceae no longer exist in Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 230. _Dicksonia Bertercana_ Hook. Fertile and\r\n  sterile pinnae. (Nat. size. British Museum Herbarium.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n          =Dennstaedtiinae.= (_Microlepia_, _Dennstaedtia_.)\r\n\r\nThis sub-tribe, instituted by Prantl, has been revived by Bower on the\r\nground that the sori present features intermediate between those of\r\nCyatheaceae and the Polypodiaceous genus _Davallia_. The sporangia have\r\na slightly oblique annulus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           =Polypodiaceae.=\r\n\r\nThis section of the Leptosporangiate ferns, including several\r\nsub-tribes, comprises the great majority of recent genera. The\r\nsporangia form naked or indusiate sori and have a vertical incomplete\r\nannulus. In _Plagiogyria_[699] the oblique annulus and soral features\r\nsuggest comparison with the Cyatheaceae. A more intimate acquaintance\r\nwith Polypodiaceous ferns will undoubtedly demonstrate the existence of\r\nother generalised types[700].\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the identification of fossil ferns it is\r\nimportant to bear in mind the very close resemblance presented by some\r\nPolypodiaceous species, e.g. species of _Davallia_ (fig. 229, C), to\r\nCyatheaceous ferns (cf. fig. 229, D).\r\n\r\n\r\n                   =Parkeriaceae.= (_Ceratopteris._)\r\n\r\nThe almost spherical and scattered sporangia are characterised by the\r\npeculiar form of the vertical annulus, which is composed of numerous\r\ncells differing in their greater breadth and smaller depth from those\r\nof a typical annulus. Exannulate sporangia have been described,\r\nwhile others occur showing different stages between a rudimentary\r\nand a complete ring. The single species of _Ceratopteris_, _C.\r\nthalictroides_, is an annual aquatic fern widely spread in tropical\r\ncountries[701].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 231.\r\n\r\n  A, A′. _Dipteris quinquefurcata_ (type-specimen in the Kew\r\n     Herbarium).\r\n  B, C, E, G. _D. conjugata._ (C, ⅛ nat. size.)\r\n  D. _Polypodium quercifolium._\r\n  F. _Dipteris Wallichii._\r\n\r\n  (D, after Luerssen.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                     =Dipteridinae.= (_Dipteris._)\r\n\r\nThe genus _Dipteris_, formerly included in the Polypodiaceae, has been\r\nassigned to a separate family partly on account of the slight obliquity\r\nof the vertical annulus (fig. 231, G) and on other grounds[702]. The\r\nfour species _Dipteris conjugata_, _D. Wallichii_, _D. Lobbiana_ (=\r\n_D. bifurcata_), and D. _quinquefurcata_ (fig. 231) are characterised\r\nby a creeping rhizome bearing fronds reaching a length of 50 cm.; in\r\n_D. conjugata_ and _D. Wallichii_ the lamina is divided by a median\r\nsinus into two symmetrical halves, while in other species the leaf\r\nis dissected into narrow linear segments. The main dichotomously\r\nbranched ribs are connected by lateral branches and these by tertiary\r\nveins, the delicate branches of which end freely within the square or\r\npolygonal areolae (fig. 231, A′, E). The naked sori are composed of\r\nnumerous sporangia and filamentous hairs: while in some species the\r\nsoral development conforms to that characteristic of the Mixtae, it has\r\nbeen shown that in one species, _D. Lobbiana_ (= _D. bifurcata_[703]),\r\nthe sporangia develope simultaneously as in the Simplices. _Dipteris_\r\noccurs in company with _Matonia_ on Mt Ophir and elsewhere in the Malay\r\npeninsula; it extends to the Philippines, Samoa, New Caledonia, China,\r\nNew Guinea, and the subtropical regions of Northern India.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nThe impossibility of drawing a hard and fast line between the divisions\r\nadopted in any system of classification is well illustrated by the\r\nferns. In the main, the three-fold grouping suggested by Bower is\r\nprobably consistent with the order of evolution of the true ferns.\r\nThe Polypodiaceae, which are now the dominant group, are in all\r\nprobability of comparatively recent origin, while the Gradatae and\r\nSimplices represent smaller subdivisions with representatives in remote\r\ngeological epochs. The genera _Loxsoma_, _Matonia_ and _Dipteris_\r\nafford examples of ferns exhibiting points of contact with more\r\nthan one of Bower’s subdivisions: they are generalised types which,\r\nlike many relics of the past, are now characterised by a restricted\r\ngeographical range.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RECENT FERNS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 232. _Davallia aculeata._ (⅖ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that while certain vegetative features may in some\r\ncases be cited as family-characters, such features are not usually\r\nof much value from a taxonomic point of view. While the typical tree\r\nferns are practically all members of the Cyatheaceae, a few members of\r\nother families, e.g. _Todea barbara_ (Osmundaceae) and the monotypic\r\nIndian genus _Brainea_ (Polypodiaceae), form erect stems several feet\r\nin height; but these differ in appearance from the Palm-like type\r\nof the Cyatheaceous tree ferns. On the other hand, the thin, almost\r\ntransparent, leaf of _Hymenophyllum tunbridgense_ and other filmy\r\nferns is a character shared by several species of _Todea_, _Asplenium\r\nresectum_, and _Danaea trichomanoides_ (Marattiaceae); the filmy habit\r\nis essentially a biological adaptation.\r\n\r\nThe form of frond represented by certain species of _Gleichenia_,\r\ncharacterised by a regular dichotomy of the axis and by the occurrence\r\nof arrested buds, is on the whole a trustworthy character, though\r\n_Davallia aculeata_ (bearing spines on its rachis) (fig. 232) and\r\n_Matonia sarmentosa_ have fronds with a similar mode of branching and\r\nalso bear arrested radius-buds. A limited acquaintance with ferns as a\r\nwhole often leads us to regard a certain form of leaf as characteristic\r\nof a particular species, but more extended enquiry usually exposes\r\nthe fallacy of relying upon so capricious a feature. The form of leaf\r\nillustrated by _Trichomanes reniforme_ is met with also in _Gymnogramme\r\nreniformis_ and is fairly closely matched by the leaf of _Scolopendrium\r\nnigripes_. The fronds of _Matonia pectinata_ (figs. 227, 228) bear\r\na close resemblance to those of _Gleichenia Cunninghami_, _Adiantum\r\npedatum_, and _Cheiropteris palmatopedata_[704].\r\n\r\n\r\n          =The habit, leaf-form, and distribution of Ferns.=\r\n\r\nThe full accounts of the structure and life-history of the common\r\nMale Fern, given by Scott in his _Structural Botany_ and by Bower in\r\nthe _Origin of a Land Flora_, render superfluous more than a brief\r\nreference to certain general considerations in so far as they may\r\nfacilitate a study of fossil types.\r\n\r\nIn size Ferns have a wide range: at the one extreme we have the\r\nfilmy fern _Trichomanes Goebelianum_[705], growing on tree stems in\r\nVenezuela, with leaves 2·5 to 3 mm. in diameter, and at the other the\r\ntree ferns with tall columnar stems reaching a height of 40 to 50 feet\r\nand terminating in a crown of fronds with a spread of several feet.\r\nA common form of stem is represented by the subterranean or creeping\r\nrhizome covered with ramental scales or hairs: the remains of old\r\nleaves may persist as ragged stumps, or, as in _Oleandra_, _Polypodium\r\nvulgare_ and several other species, the leaf may be cut off by the\r\nformation of an absciss-layer[706] leaving a clean-cut peg projecting\r\nfrom the stem. As a rule the branches bear no relation to the leaves\r\nand are often given off from the lower part of a petiole, but in a\r\nfew cases, e.g. in the _Hymenophyllaceae_, it is noteworthy that true\r\naxillary branching is the rule[707]. In the typical tree-fern the\r\nsurface resembles that of a Cycadean trunk covered with persistent\r\nleaf-bases and a thick mass of roots. Among epiphytic ferns highly\r\nmodified stems are occasionally met with, as in the Malayan species\r\n_Polypodium_ (_Lecanopteris_) _carnosum_ and _P. sinuosum_[708].\r\n\r\nThe leaves of ferns are among the most protean of all plant organs;\r\nas Darwin wrote, “the variability of ferns passes all bounds[709].”\r\nThe highly compound tri- or quadripinnate leaves of such species as\r\n_Pteris aquilina_, _Davallia_ and other genera stand for the central\r\ntype of fern frond; others exhibit a well-marked dichotomy, e.g.\r\n_Lygodium_, _Gleichenia_, _Matonia_, etc., a habit in all probability\r\nassociated with the older rather than with the more modern products\r\nof fern evolution. Before attempting to determine specifically fossil\r\nfern fronds, it is important to familiarise ourselves with the range of\r\nvariability among existing species and more especially in leaves of the\r\nsame plant. A striking example of heteromorphy is illustrated in fig.\r\n233. Reinecke[710] has figured a plant of _Asplenium multilineatum_\r\nin which the segments of the compound fronds assume various forms.\r\nIn _Teratophyllum aculeatum var. inermis_ Mett., a tropical climbing\r\nfern believed by Karsten[711] to be identical with _Acrostichum_\r\n(_Lomariopsis_) _sorbifolium_,—an identification which Goebel[712]\r\nquestions,—the fronds which stand free of the stem supporting the\r\nclimber differ considerably from the translucent and much more delicate\r\nfilmy leaves pressed against the supporting tree. From this fern\r\nalone Fée is said to have created 17 distinct species. In this, as in\r\nmany other cases, differences in leaf-form are the expression of a\r\nphysiological division of labour connected with an epiphytic existence.\r\nSome tropical species of _Polypodium_ (sect. _Drynaria_), e.g. _P.\r\nquercifolium_ (fig. 234 and fig. 231, D), produce two distinct types of\r\nleaf, the large green fronds, concerned with the assimilation of carbon\r\nand spore-production, being in sharp contrast to the small slightly\r\nlobed brown leaves which act as stiff brackets (fig. 234, M) for\r\ncollecting humus from which the roots absorb raw material. Similarly in\r\n_Platycerium_ the orbicular mantle-leaves differ widely from the long\r\npendulous or erect fronds fashioned like the spreading antlers of an\r\nelk. In _Hemitelia capensis_, a South African Cyatheaceous species, the\r\nbasal pinnae assume the form of finely divided leaves identified by\r\nearlier collectors as those of a parasitic _Trichomanes_ (fig. 235).\r\nIn a letter written by W. H. Harvey in 1837 accompanying the specimen\r\nshown in fig. 235, he says, “Apropos of _Hemitelia_, be it known abroad\r\nthat supposed parasitical _Trichomanes_ ... is not a parasite, but a\r\npart of the frond of _Hemitelia_.” The delicate reduced pinnae remain\r\non the stem and form a cluster at the base of the fronds[713].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 233. _Polypodium Billardieri_ Br. (¼ nat. size.)\r\n  Middle Island, New Zealand. From specimens in the Cambridge\r\n  Herbarium.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 234. _Polypodium quercifolium._ (Much reduced: M,\r\n  Mantle-leaves.)]\r\n\r\nIn many species the sporophylls are distinguished from the sterile\r\nfronds by segments with little or no chlorophyllous tissue, as in\r\n_Onoclea struthiopteris_[714] in which, each year, the plant produces\r\na funnel-shaped group of sterile leaves followed later in the season\r\nby a cluster of sporophylls; or, as in many other genera, the fertile\r\nleaves are distinguished also by longer petioles and thus serve as\r\nmore efficient agents of spore-dissemination. In _Ceratopteris_\r\nthe narrow segments of the taller fertile leaves are in striking\r\ncontrast to the broader pinnules of the submerged foliage leaves.\r\nLeaf-form is in many cases obviously the expression of environment;\r\nthe xerophilous fern _Jamesonia_[715] from the treeless paramos of\r\nthe Andes[716] is characterised by its minute leaflets with strong\r\nrevolute margins and a thick felt of hairs on the lower surface; in\r\nothers, xerophilous features take the form of a covering of overlapping\r\nscales (_Ceterach_), or a development of water-tissue as in the fleshy\r\nleaves of the Himalayan fern _Drymoglossum carnosum_. In the Bracken\r\nfern Boodle[717] has shown how the fronds may be classed as shade and\r\nsun leaves; the former are spreading and softer, while the latter are\r\nrelatively smaller and of harder texture (fig. 236, _a_ and _b_). Even\r\nin one leaf six feet high, growing through a dense bush of gorse and\r\nbramble, the lower part was found to have the features of a shade leaf,\r\nwhile the uppermost exposed pinnae were xerophilous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 235. _Hemitelia capensis_ R.

(¼ nat. size.) After Boodle.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PTERIS]\r\n\r\nThe resemblance between some of the filmy Hymenophyllaceae and\r\nthalloid Liverworts[718] is worthy of mention as one of the many\r\npossible pitfalls to be avoided by the palaeobotanical student. The\r\nlong linear fronds of such genera as _Vittaria_ and _Monogramme_\r\nmight well be identified in a fossil state as the leaves of a\r\ngrass-like Monocotyledon, or compared with the foliage of _Isoetes_\r\nor _Pilularia_. The resemblance of some fern leaves with reticulate\r\nvenation to those of Dicotyledons has led astray experienced\r\npalaeobotanists; it is not only the anastomosing venation in the leaves\r\nof several ferns that simulates dicotyledonous foliage, but the\r\ncompound leaves of many dicotyledons, e.g. _Paullinia thalictrifolia_\r\n(Sapindaceae) and species of Umbelliferae, may easily be mistaken for\r\nfronds of ferns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 236 _b_. _Pteris aquilina._\r\n\r\n  Leaf from the same plant grown out of doors. (¼ nat. size.)\r\n  After Boodle.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RECENT FERNS]\r\n\r\nThe dichotomously lobed lamina of some Schizaeas, e.g. _S. dichotoma_\r\nand _S. elegans_ (fig. 222), bears a close resemblance to the leaves of\r\n_Baiera_ or _Ginkgo_[719]. The original description by Kunze[720] of\r\nthe South African Cycad _Stangeria paradoxa_ as a Polypodiaceous fern\r\nillustrates the difficulty, or indeed impossibility, of distinguishing\r\nbetween a sterile simply pinnate fern frond and the foliage of some\r\nCycads. The deeply divided segments of _Cycas Micholitzii_[721]\r\nsimulate the dichotomously branched pinnae of _Lygodium dichotomum_,\r\nand the leaves of _Aneimia rotundifolia_ (fig. 223) and other species\r\nare almost identical in form with the Jurassic species _Otozamites\r\nBeani_, a member of the Cycadophyta.\r\n\r\nThere are certain facts in regard to the geographical distribution of\r\nferns to which attention should be directed. Mr Baker in his paper on\r\nfern distribution writes: “With the precision of an hygrometer, an\r\nincrease in the fern-vegetation marks the wooded humid regions[722].”\r\nIf in a collection of fossil plants we find a preponderance of ferns\r\nwe are tempted to assume the existence of such conditions as are\r\nfavourable to the luxuriant development of ferns at the present day.\r\nOn the other hand, we must bear in mind the wonderful plasticity of\r\nmany recent species and the fact that xerophilous ferns are by no means\r\nunknown in present-day floras.\r\n\r\nFerns are admirably adapted to rapid dispersal over comparatively wide\r\nareas. Bower[723] estimates that in one season a Male Fern may produce\r\nabout 5,000,000 spores: with this enormous spore-output are coupled a\r\nthoroughly efficient mechanism for scattering the germs and an unusual\r\nfacility for wind-dispersal. When Treub[724] visited the devastated\r\nand sterilised wreck of the Island of Krakatau in 1886, three years\r\nafter the volcanic outburst, he found that twelve ferns had already\r\nestablished themselves; the spores had probably been carried by the\r\nwind at least 25 to 30 miles. It is not surprising, therefore, to find\r\nthat many ferns have an almost world-wide distribution; and, it may\r\nbe added, in view of their efficient means of dispersal, wide range\r\nby no means implies great antiquity. Prof. Campbell[725] has recently\r\ncalled attention to the significance of the wide distribution of\r\nHepaticae in its bearing on their antiquity; the spores are incapable\r\nof retaining vitality for more than a short period, and it is argued\r\nthat a world-wide distribution can have been acquired only after an\r\nenormous lapse of time. If we apply this reasoning to the Osmundaceae\r\namong ferns, it may be legitimate to assume that their short-lived\r\ngreen spores render them much less efficient colonisers than the\r\ngreat majority of ferns; if this is granted, the wide distribution of\r\nOsmundaceous ferns in the Mesozoic era carries their history back to a\r\nstill more remote past, a conclusion which receives support from the\r\nrecords of the rocks.\r\n\r\nThe Bracken fern which we regard as characteristically British is a\r\ncosmopolitan type; it was found by Treub among the pioneers of the New\r\nFlora of Krakatau; in British Central Africa, it greets one at every\r\nturn “like a messenger from the homeland[726]”; it grows on the Swiss\r\nAlps, on the mountains of Abyssinia, in Tasmania, and on the slopes\r\nof the Himalayas. The two genera _Matonia_ (fig. 228) and _Dipteris_,\r\nwhich grow side by side on Mount Ophir in the Malay Peninsula, are\r\nexamples of restricted geographical range and carry us back to the\r\nJurassic period when closely allied types flourished abundantly in\r\nnorthern latitudes. Similarly _Thyrsopteris elegans_, confined to Juan\r\nFernandez, exhibits a remarkable likeness to Jurassic species from\r\nEngland and the Arctic regions.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of ferns to flowering plants in recent floras is a\r\nquestion of some interest from a palaeobotanical point of view; but we\r\nmust bear in mind the fact that the evolution of angiosperms, effected\r\nat a late stage in the history of the earth, seriously disturbed the\r\nbalance of power among competitors for earth and air. The abundance\r\nof ferns in a particular region is, however, an unsafe guide to\r\ngeographical or climatic conditions. Many ferns are essentially social\r\nplants; the wide stretches of moorland carpeted with _Pteris aquilina_\r\nafford an example of the monopolisation of the soil by a single\r\nspecies. In Sikkim Sir Joseph Hooker speaks of extensive groves of tree\r\nferns, and in the wet regions of the Amazon, Bates[727] describes the\r\nwhole forest glade as forming a “vast fernery.” In a valley in Tahiti\r\n_Alsophila tahitiensis_ is said to form “a sort of forest almost to\r\nthe exclusion of other ferns[728].” In the abundance of _Glossopteris_\r\n(figs. 334, etc.) fronds spread over wide areas of Permo-Carboniferous\r\nrocks in S. Africa, Australia, and India, we have a striking instance\r\nof a similar social habit in an extinct fern or at least fern-like\r\nplant.\r\n\r\n_Acrostichum aureum_, with pinnate fronds several feet long, is an\r\nexample of a recent fern covering immense tracts, but this species[729]\r\nis more especially interesting as a member of the Filicineae\r\ncharacteristic of brackish marshes and the banks of tropical rivers\r\nin company with Mangrove plants and the “Stemless Palm” _Nipa_. This\r\nspecies exhibits the anatomical characters of a water-plant and\r\naffords an interesting parallel with some Palaeozoic ferns (species of\r\n_Psaronius_) which probably grew under similar conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        =The Anatomy of Ferns.=\r\n\r\nThe text-book accounts of fern-anatomy convey a very inadequate idea\r\nof the architectural characters displayed by the vascular systems\r\nof recent genera. When we are concerned with the study of extinct\r\nplants it is essential to be familiar not only with the commoner\r\nrecent types, but particularly with exceptional or aberrant types. The\r\nvascular system of many ferns consists of strands of xylem composed\r\nof scalariform tracheae associated with a larger or smaller amount of\r\nparenchyma, surrounded either wholly or in part (that is concentric\r\nor bicollateral) by phloem: beyond this is a pericycle, one layer\r\nor frequently several layers in breadth, limited externally by an\r\nendodermis, which can usually be readily recognised. The vascular\r\nstrands are embedded in the ground-tissue of the stem consisting of\r\nthin-walled parenchyma and, in most ferns, a considerable quantity of\r\nhard and lignified mechanical tissue. The narrow protoxylem elements\r\nare usually characterised by a spiral form of thickening, but in\r\nslow-growing stems the first-formed elements are frequently of the\r\nscalariform type.\r\n\r\nA study of the anatomy of recent ferns both in the adult state and\r\nin successive stages of development from the embryo has on the whole\r\nrevealed “a striking parallelism[730]” between vascular and sporangial\r\ncharacters in leptosporangiate ferns. For a masterly treatment of our\r\nknowledge of fern anatomy from a phylogenetic point of view reference\r\nshould be made to Mr Tansley’s recently published lectures: within the\r\nlimits of this volume all that is possible is a brief outline of the\r\nmain types of vascular structure illustrated by recent genera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 237.\r\n\r\n  A. _Matonia pectinata_ (petiole).\r\n  B. _M. pectinata_ (stem).\r\n  C. _Gleichenia dicarpa_ (stem): _p_, petiole; _pp_, protophloem;\r\n     position of protoxylem indicated by black dots.\r\n  D. _Matonidium._\r\n  E. _Trichomanes reniforme_: _pp_, protophloem. (C, E, after Boodle;\r\n     D, after Bommer.)]\r\n\r\nTo Prof. Jeffrey[731] we owe the term protostele which he applied to\r\na type of stele consisting of a central core of xylem surrounded by\r\nphloem, pericycle, and endodermis. While admitting that steles of this\r\ntype may sometimes be the result of the modification of less simple\r\nforms, we may confidently regard the protostele as representing the\r\nmost primitive form of vascular system. The genus _Lygodium_ affords\r\nan example of a protostelic fern; a solid column of xylem tracheae\r\nand parenchyma is completely encircled by a cylinder of phloem\r\nsucceeded by a multi-layered pericycle and an endodermis of a single\r\nlayer of cells. In this genus the stele is characterised by marginal\r\ngroups of protoxylem; it is exarch. An almost identical type is\r\nrepresented by species of _Gleichenia_, but here the stele is mesarch,\r\nthe protoxylem being slightly internal (fig. 237, C). _Trichomanes\r\nscandens_ (fig. 238) has an exarch protostele like that of _Lygodium_;\r\nbut, as Boodle[732] has suggested, the protostelic form in this case\r\nis probably the result of modification of a collateral form of stele\r\nsuch as occurs in _Trichomanes reniforme_ (fig. 237, E). A second type\r\nof stele has been described in species of _Lindsaya_[733] in which\r\nthe xylem includes a small group of phloem near the dorsal surface.\r\nThis _Lindsaya_ type is often passed through in the development of\r\n“seedling” ferns and may be regarded as a stage in a series leading\r\nto another well-marked type, the solenostele. The solenostele[734],\r\na hollow cylinder of xylem lined within and without by phloem,\r\npericycle, and endodermis, occurs in several genera belonging to\r\ndifferent families, e.g. _Dipteris_, species of _Pteris_, species of\r\n_Lindsaya_, _Polypodium_, _Jamesonia_, _Loxsoma_, _Gleichenia_ and\r\nother genera. In a smaller number of ferns the stele consists of what\r\nmay be called a medullated protostele similar to the common form of\r\nstele in _Lepidodendron_: this type is found in species of _Schizaea_\r\nand in _Platyzoma_ (fig. 239). It is important to notice that in\r\nthe solenostele and as a rule in the medullated protostele when a\r\nleaf-trace passes out from the rhizome stele the vascular cylinder is\r\ninterrupted by the formation of a foliar gap (_Platyzoma_[735], fig.\r\n239, is an exception). This fact has been emphasized by Jeffrey[736]\r\nwho draws a distinction between the Lycopodiaceous type of stele, which\r\nis not broken by the exit of leaf-traces, and the fern stele in which\r\nfoliar gaps are produced: the former he speaks of as the cladosiphonic\r\ntype (_Lycopsida_) and the latter as the phyllosiphonic (_Pteropsida_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 238. Stele of _Trichomanes scandens_: _px_,\r\n  protoxylem; _s_, endodermis. From Tansley, after Boodle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 239. _Platyzoma microphylla_. _l.t._, leaf-trace;\r\n  _i.e._, internal endodermis. (After Tansley; modified from\r\n  Boodle.)]\r\n\r\nThe transition to a hollow cylinder of xylem from a protostele\r\nmay be described as the result of the replacement of some of the\r\naxial conducting tracheae by parenchyma or other non-vascular\r\ntissue consequent on an increase in diameter of the whole stele\r\nand the concentration of the true conducting elements towards the\r\nperiphery[737].\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of the internal cylinder of phloem, pericycle, and\r\nendodermis in a solenostele is rendered intelligible by a study of\r\nfern seedlings and by a comparative examination of transitional types\r\nconnecting protosteles and solenosteles through medullated protosteles\r\nand steles of the _Lindsaya_ type. A further stage in stelar evolution\r\nis illustrated by what is termed the dictyostele, the arrangement of\r\nvascular tissue characteristic of _Nephrodium Filix-mas_, _Cyathea_\r\n(fig. 240), _Polypodium vulgare_ and many other common ferns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 240. _Cyathea Imrayana._ (From Tansley after de\r\n  Bary.) (Sclerenchyma represented by black bands.)]\r\n\r\nIf a solenostele is interrupted by leaf-gaps at intervals sufficiently\r\nclose to cause overlapping, a transverse section at any part of the\r\nstele will show apparently separate curved bands of concentrically\r\narranged xylem and phloem, which on dissection are seen to represent\r\nparts of a continuous lattice-work or a cylinder with the wall pierced\r\nby large meshes. The manner of evolution of the dictyostele has been\r\nably dealt with by Gwynne-Vaughan[738] and other authors. In a few\r\nferns, e.g. _Matonia pectinata_[739], a transverse section of the\r\nstem (fig. 237, B) reveals the presence of two or in some cases three\r\nconcentric solenosteles with a solid protostele in the centre: this\r\n_polycylic_ type may be regarded as the expression of the fact that in\r\nresponse to the need for an adequate water-supply to the large fronds,\r\nferns have increased the conducting channels by a method other than by\r\nthe mere increase of the diameter of a single stele. Fig. 237, A, shows\r\nthe vascular tissue of a petiole of _Matonia_ in transverse section.\r\n\r\nThe two genera of Osmundaceae, _Todea_ and _Osmunda_, are peculiar\r\namong recent ferns in having a vascular cylinder composed of separate\r\nstrands of xylem varying considerably in shape and size, from\r\n=U=-shaped strands with the concavity facing the centre of the stem\r\nand with the protoxylem in the hollow of the =U=, to oval or more\r\nor less circular strands with a mesarch protoxylem or without any\r\nprotoxylem elements (fig. 221, A, B). These different forms are the\r\nexpression of the change in contour or in structure which the parts\r\nof the lattice-work undergo at different levels in the stem[740].\r\nBeyond this ring of xylem bundles is a continuous sheath of phloem of\r\ncharacteristic structure. A transverse section of a stem of _Osmunda\r\nregalis_ may show 15 or more xylem strands; in _O. Claytoniana_ there\r\nmay be as many as 40. In _Todea barbara_ (fig. 221, B) the leaf-gaps\r\nare shorter, and in consequence of the less amount of overlapping the\r\nxylem cylinder becomes an almost continuous tube. The recent researches\r\nof Kidston and Gwynne-Vaughan[741] have resulted in the discovery of\r\nfossil Osmundaceous stems with a complete xylem ring, the stele being\r\nof the medullated protostele type; in another extinct member of the\r\nfamily the stele consists of a solid xylem core. The Osmundaceous\r\ntype of stele is complicated in _O. cinnamomea_ (fig. 221, A) by the\r\noccurrence of local internal phloem and by an internal endodermis,\r\na feature which leads Jeffrey to what I believe to be an incorrect\r\nconclusion that the vascular arrangement found in _Osmunda regalis_ has\r\nbeen evolved by reduction from a stele in which the xylem was enclosed\r\nwithin and without by phloem. New facts recently brought to light\r\nenable us to derive the ordinary Osmundaceous type from the protostele\r\nand solenostele. It is worthy of remark that the Osmundaceae occupy a\r\nsomewhat isolated position among recent ferns; their anatomy represents\r\na special type, their sporangia differ in several respects from those\r\nof other leptosporangiate ferns and in some features _Osmunda_ and\r\n_Todea_ agree with the Eusporangiate ferns. The possession of such\r\ndistinguishing characters as these suggests antiquity; and the facts\r\nof palaeobotany, as also the present geographical range of the family,\r\nconfirm the correctness of this deduction.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the stelar structure of leptosporangiate fern stems,\r\na word must be added in regard to a type of structure met with in\r\nthe Hymenophyllaceae. In this family _Trichomanes reniforme_ (fig.\r\n237, E) may be regarded, as Boodle suggests, as the central type: the\r\nstele consists of a ring of metaxylem tracheae, the dorsal portion\r\nhaving the form of a flat arch and the ventral half that of a straight\r\nband. This flattened ring of xylem encloses parenchymatous tissue\r\ncontaining scattered tracheae some of which are protoxylem elements. In\r\n_Trichomanes radicans_ the rhizome is stouter than in _T. reniforme_\r\nand the stele consists of a greater number of tracheae. The stele is\r\ncylindrical like that shown in fig. 238, but the centre is occupied by\r\ntwo groups of protoxylem and associated parenchyma. In _Hymenophyllum\r\ntunbrigense_ the stele is of the subcollateral type; the ventral plate\r\nof the xylem ring has disappeared leaving a single strand of xylem with\r\nendarch protoxylem and completely surrounded by phloem. _Trichomanes\r\nmuscoides_ possesses a still simpler stele consisting of a slender\r\nxylem strand with phloem on one side only. Reference has already been\r\nmade to the occurrence in this family of the protostelic type. The\r\nHymenophyllaceae afford a striking illustration of the modification in\r\ndifferent directions of stelar structure connected with differences in\r\nhabit, and of the correlation of demand and supply as shown in the\r\nvarying amount of conducting tissue in the steles of different species.\r\n\r\nThe leaf-trace in a great number of ferns is characterised by its\r\n=C=-shaped form[742] as seen in transverse section: this in some\r\ngenera, e.g. _Matonia_ (fig. 237, A), is complicated by the spiral\r\ninfolding of the free edges of the =C=; in other ferns (e.g. some\r\nCyatheaceae) (fig. 278, C) the sides of the =C= are incurved, while in\r\nsome species the xylem is broken up into a large number of separate\r\nstrands.\r\n\r\nAn elaborate treatment of the leaf-traces of ferns was published a few\r\nyears ago by MM. Bertrand and Cornaille[743] in which the authors show\r\nhow the various systems of vascular tissue in the fronds of ferns maybe\r\nderived from a common type. As Prof. Chodat[744] justly remarks this\r\nimportant work has not received the attention it deserves, the neglect\r\nbeing attributed to the strange notation which is adopted[745].\r\n\r\nThe roots of ferns are characterised by a uniformity of plan in marked\r\ncontrast to the wide range of structure met with in the stem and to\r\na less extent in the leaves. The xylem may consist of a plate of\r\nscalariform tracheae with a protoxylem group at each end, or the stele\r\nmay include six or more alternating strands of xylem and phloem.\r\n\r\n\r\n        II. =Marattiales= (Eusporangiate isosporous Filicales).\r\n\r\nThe Marattiaceae, the single family of ferns included in the\r\nMarattiales, comprise the genera _Angiopteris_, _Archangiopteris_,\r\n_Marattia_, _Danaea_, and _Kaulfussia_, which are for the most\r\npart tropical in distribution. These genera are characterised by\r\neusporangiate sori or synangia, the presence of stipules at the base of\r\nthe petioles, and by the complex arrangement of the vascular tissue. In\r\nview of the fact that many fossil ferns show a close resemblance to the\r\nrecent Marattiaceae, the surviving genera are briefly described. The\r\nprothallus is green and relatively large.\r\n\r\n_Angiopteris._ This genus occurs in Polynesia, tropical Asia, and\r\nMadagascar; it is characterised by a short and thick fleshy stem\r\nbearing large bipinnate leaves which occasionally show a forking of\r\nthe rachis[746], a feature reminiscent of some Palaeozoic fern-like\r\nfronds. One of the large plants of _Angiopteris evecta_ in the Royal\r\nGardens, Kew, bears leaves 12 feet in length with a stalk 6 inches\r\nin diameter at the base. The sessile or shortly stalked and rather\r\nleathery linear or broadly lanceolate pinnules have a prominent\r\nmidrib and dichotomously branched lateral veins. The surface of an\r\nold stem is covered with the thick stumps of petioles enclosed by\r\npairs of fleshy stipules (fig. 241, A) and bears numerous fleshy\r\nroots, which hang free in the air or penetrate the soil. The young\r\nfronds (fig. 220, A) exhibit very clearly the characteristic circinate\r\nvernation. The proximal part of each primary pinna is characterised by\r\na pulvinus-like swelling. The sporangia, in short linear elliptical\r\nsori near the edge of the pinnules, consist of free sporangia (fig.\r\n242, A–D) provided with a peculiar type of “annulus”[747], in the form\r\nof a narrow band of thicker-walled cells, which extends as a broad\r\nstrip on either side of the apex. An examination of sections through\r\nthe sporangia of _Angiopteris_ in different planes[748] illustrates\r\nthe difficulty of determining the precise nature of the annulus in a\r\npetrified sporangium which is seen only in one or two planes. Many of\r\nthe sporangia from the English Coal-Measures, compared by authors with\r\nthose of Leptosporangiate ferns, are in all probability referable to\r\nthe Marattiaceous type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 241.\r\n\r\n  A. _Angiopteris evecta._ (Considerably reduced.)\r\n  B. _Marattia fraxinea._ Stipule. M.S.]\r\n\r\nThe vascular system[749] of the stem constitutes a highly complex\r\ndictyostelic or polycylic type which may consist of as many as nine\r\nconcentric series of strands of xylem surrounded by phloem, with\r\nlarge sieve-tubes and a pericycle which abuts on the parenchymatous\r\nground-tissue without any definite endodermal layer. A peculiarity in\r\nthe vascular strands is that the first-formed elements of the phloem\r\nlie close to the edge of the xylem, the metaphloem being therefore\r\ncentrifugal in its development. The ground-tissue is devoid of\r\nmechanical tissue and is penetrated by roots, a few of which arise\r\nfrom the outer vascular strands while others force their way to the\r\nsurface from the more internal dictyosteles. Leaf-traces, consisting\r\nof several strands, are given off from the outermost cylinder and a\r\nsegment of the second dictyostele moves out to fill the gap formed in\r\nthe outermost network, while the gap in the second cylinder receives\r\ncompensating strands from the third. A few layers below the surface of\r\nthe petiole there is a ring of thick-walled elements (_s_, fig. 243),\r\nand in both petiole and stem numerous mucilage ducts and tannin-sacs\r\noccur in the ground-tissue. It has been shown by Farmer and Hill[750]\r\nthat in some of the vascular strands in an _Angiopteris_ stem a few\r\nsecondary tracheae are added to the primary xylem by the activity of\r\nthe adjacent parenchyma. The vascular bundles in the petiole form more\r\nor less regular concentric series; they have no endodermis and are\r\ncharacterised also by the large size of the sieve-tubes (_st_, fig.\r\n243).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 242.

Transverse section of\r\n  root, with part of the stele magnified: _s_, sieve-tubes; _p_,\r\n  phloem; _px_, protoxylem.]\r\n\r\n_Archangiopteris_. This monotypic genus, discovered by Mr Henry in\r\nSouth Eastern Yunnan, was described by Christ and Giesenhagen in\r\n1899[751]. The comparatively slender rhizome has a fairly simple\r\nvascular system[752]. The simply-pinnate leaves bear pinnules like\r\nthose of _Danaea_, but the sori agree with those of _Angiopteris_\r\nexcept in their greater length and in the larger number of sporangia.\r\n\r\n_Marattia_. This genus, which extends “all round the world within\r\nthe tropics[753],” includes some species which closely resemble\r\n_Angiopteris_, while others are characterised by more finely divided\r\nleaves with smaller ultimate segments. The fleshy stipules occasionally\r\nhave an irregularly pinnatifid form (fig. 241, B). The sporangia are\r\nrepresented by oval synangia[754] (fig. 245, A; the black patches\r\nat the ends of the lateral veins) composed of two valves, which on\r\nripening come apart and expose two rows of pores formed by the apical\r\ndehiscence of the sporangial compartments (fig. 245, A′, B). In\r\n_Marattia Kaulfussii_ the sori are attached to the lamina by a short\r\nstalk (fig. 245, B, B′) and the leaf bears a close resemblance to\r\nthose of the Umbelliferous genera _Anthriscus_ and _Chaerophyllum_.\r\nThe vascular system is constructed on the same plan as that of\r\n_Angiopteris_ but is of simpler form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 245.\r\n\r\n  A. _Marattia fraxinea_. A′. A single synangium showing the two\r\n     valves and pores of the sporangial compartments.\r\n  B, B′. _M.

Each sorus consists of numerous\r\nsporangia in two parallel rows united into an oblong mass partially\r\noverarched by an indusium (fig. 242, E, _i_) which grows up from the\r\nleaf between the sori. In the portion of a fertile segment shown in\r\nfig. 242, E, the apical pores are seen at _a_; and at _b_, where the\r\nroof of the synangium has been removed, the spore-bearing compartments\r\nare exposed. The vascular system[755] agrees in general plan with that\r\ncharacteristic of the family.\r\n\r\n_Kaulfussia._ The form of the leaf (Vol. I. p. 97, fig. 22) closely\r\nresembles that of the Horse Chestnut; the stem is a creeping\r\ndorsiventral rhizome with a vascular system in the form of a “much\r\nperforated solenostele[756].” The synangia are circular, with a median\r\ndepression; each sporangial compartment opens by an apical pore on the\r\nsloping sides of the synangial cup (fig. 245, C)[757].\r\n\r\nCopeland has recently described a Marattiaceous leaf which he makes\r\nthe type of a new genus, _Macroglossum alidae_. The sori are nearer\r\nthe margin than in _Angiopteris_ and are said to consist of a greater\r\nnumber of sporangia. The photograph[758] of a single pinna which\r\naccompanies the brief description hardly affords satisfactory evidence\r\nin support of the creation of a new genus. The structure of a petiole\r\nwhich I have had an opportunity of examining, through the kindness of\r\nMr Hewitt of Sarawak, shows no distinctive features.\r\n\r\n\r\n        III. =Ophioglossales.= (Isosporous and Eusporangiate.)\r\n\r\nThe three genera, _Ophioglossum_, _Botrychium_, and _Helminthostachys_,\r\nare characterised by the division of the leaves into a sterile\r\nand a fertile lobe. The fertile lobe in _Ophioglossum_ bears two\r\nrows of spherical sporangia sunk in its tissue; in _Botrychium_\r\nand _Helminthostachys_ the spores are contained in large sporangia\r\nwith a stout wall[759]. The prothallus is subterranean and without\r\nchlorophyll. In the British species of _Ophioglossum_, _O. vulgatum_\r\n(the adder’s tongue fern), an almost cosmopolitan species, the sterile\r\npart of the frond is of oval form and has reticulate venation. In _O.\r\npendulum_ and _O._ _palmatum_ the lamina is deeply lobed. In the genus\r\n_Botrychium_, represented in Britain by _B. Lunaria_, both sterile\r\nand fertile branches of the frond are pinnately divided, while in\r\n_Helminthostachys_ the sporangia are borne on sporangiophores given off\r\nfrom the margin of the fertile branch of a frond similar in habit to a\r\nleaf of _Helleborus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 246. _Ophioglossum vulgatum._ Transverse section of\r\n  petiole and single bundle: _p_, phloem; _px_, endarch protoxylem.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 247. _Botrychium virginianum_: _e_, endodermis;\r\n  _c_, cambium; _x_, xylem. A, diagrammatic section of stem; B,\r\n  portion of the stele and endodermis enlarged.\r\n\r\n  (A, after Campbell; B, after Jeffrey.)]\r\n\r\nThe stem of _Ophioglossum_ is characterised by a dictyostele of\r\ncollateral bundles with endarch protoxylem: the vascular system of the\r\nleaf-stalk is also composed of several separate strands (fig. 246).\r\nIn _Botrychium_ the stele is a cylinder of xylem surrounded externally\r\nby phloem. This genus affords the only instance among ferns of a\r\nplant in which the addition of secondary tracheae occurs on a scale\r\nlarge enough to produce a well-defined cylinder of secondary xylem\r\ntraversed by radial rows of medullary-ray cells[760] (fig. 247). The\r\nunsatisfactory nature of the evidence in regard to the past history of\r\nthe Ophioglossales renders superfluous a fuller treatment of the recent\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n                             FOSSIL FERNS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =Osmundaceae.=\r\n\r\nFrom the Culm of Silesia, Stur[761] described impressions of sterile\r\nfronds which he named _Todea Lipoldi_ on the ground of the similarity\r\nof the finely divided pinnules to those of _Todea superba_ and\r\nother filmy species of the genus. The type-specimen of Stur (in\r\nthe Geological Survey Museum, Vienna) affords no information as to\r\nsporangial characters and cannot be accepted as an authentic record\r\nof a Lower Carboniferous representative of the family. Another more\r\nsatisfactory but hardly convincing piece of evidence bearing on the\r\npresence of Osmundaceae in pre-Permian floras has been adduced by\r\nRenault[762], who described petrified sporangia from the Culm beds of\r\nEsnost in France as _Todeopsis primaeva_ (fig. 256, F). These pyriform\r\nsporangia are characterised by the presence of a plate of large cells\r\ncomparable with the subapical group of “annulus” cells in the sporangia\r\nof the recent species (fig. 221).\r\n\r\nZeiller[763] has published a figure of some sporangia described by\r\nRenault from Autun resembling the Osmundaceous type in having a plate\r\nof thick-walled cells instead of a true annulus, but the plate is\r\nlarger than the group of cells in the recent sporangia, and both\r\nsporangia and spores are smaller in the fossil. The sporangia from\r\nCarboniferous rocks described by Weiss as _Sturiella_[764] bear some\r\nresemblance to those of recent Osmundaceae, but there is no adequate\r\nreason for referring them to this family.\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Pteridotheca_ is employed by Scott as a convenient\r\ndesignation for unassigned petrified sporangia of Palaeozoic age with\r\nan annulus and other characters indicating fern-affinity. In the\r\nspecies _P. Butterworthi_[765] the sporangia are characterised by a\r\ngroup of large cells suggesting comparison with the annulus, or what\r\nrepresents the annulus, in Osmundaceae and Marattiaceae. Scott has also\r\ndescribed a sporangium from the Coal-Measures containing germinating\r\nspores[766]; the structure is similar to that of recent Osmundaceous\r\nsporangia, and it is interesting to note that germinating spores have\r\nbeen observed in the recent species _Todea hymenophylloides_[767].\r\n\r\nAdditional evidence of the same kind is afforded by fertile specimens\r\nof a quadripinnate fern with deeply dissected oval-lanceolate pinnules\r\ndescribed by Zeiller from the Coal-Measures of Heraclea in Asia Minor\r\nas _Kidstonia heracleensis_[768] (fig. 256, E). Carbonised sporangia\r\nwere found at the base of narrow lobes of the ultimate segments and,\r\nas seen in fig. 256, E, the sporangial wall is distinguished by a\r\nplate of larger cells occupying a position like that of the “annulus”\r\nof recent Osmundaceae. Zeiller regards the sporangia as intermediate\r\nbetween those of Osmundaceae and Schizaeaceae. From the same locality\r\nZeiller describes another frond bearing somewhat similar sporangia as\r\n_Sphenopteris_ (_Discopteris_) _Rallii_ (fig. 256, D)[769]: the term\r\n_Discopteris_ was instituted by Stur for fertile fronds referred by him\r\nto the Marattiaceae[770].\r\n\r\nIt is by no means safe to assume that these and such Upper\r\nCarboniferous sporangia as Bower[771] compared with those of\r\n_Todea_ were borne on plants possessing the anatomical characters\r\nof Osmundaceae rather than those of the extinct Palaeozoic family\r\nBotryopterideae. This brings us to the important fact, first pointed\r\nout by Renault, that the Botryopterideae are essentially generalised\r\nferns exhibiting many points of contact with the Osmundaceae[772].\r\nIt is clear that whether or not we are justified in tracing the\r\nOsmundaceae as far back as the Lower Carboniferous period, some of the\r\ncharacteristics of the family were already foreshadowed in rocks of\r\nthis age.\r\n\r\nThrough a fortunate accident of preservation, unequivocal evidence of\r\nthe existence of Osmundaceae in the Palaeozoic era is supplied by the\r\nRussian Upper Permian genera _Zalesskya_ and _Thamnopteris_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Zalesskya._\r\n\r\nThis generic title has been instituted by Kidston and\r\nGwynne-Vaughan[773] for two Russian stems of Upper Permian age, one\r\nof which was named by Eichwald[774] _Chelepteris gracilis_, but the\r\nprobability that the type of the genus _Chelepteris_ is generically\r\ndistinct from Eichwald’s species necessitated a new designation for the\r\nPermian fern.\r\n\r\nIn habit the stem of _Zalesskya_ resembles that of an _Osmunda_ or a\r\n_Todea_, but it differs in the possession of a stele composed of a\r\ncontinuous cylinder or solid column of xylem surrounded by phloem,\r\nand by the differentiation of the xylem into two concentric zones.\r\nThe leaves are represented by petiole-bases only; the sporangia are\r\nunknown. The stem and leaf-base anatomy fully justifies the inclusion\r\nof _Zalesskya_ in the Osmundaceae.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Zalesskya gracilis_ (Eichwald). Fig. 248.\r\n\r\nThe type-specimen is a partially decorticated stem, from Upper Permian\r\nbeds in Russia, provided with a single stele, 13 mm. in diameter,\r\nsurrounded by a broad thin-walled inner cortex containing numerous\r\nleaf-traces and occasional roots: this was doubtless succeeded by a\r\nsclerotic outer cortex. In its main features _Zalesskya gracilis_\r\nagrees closely with _Z. diploxylon_ represented in fig. 249. The stele\r\nconsists of a continuous cylinder of xylem exhibiting a fairly distinct\r\ndifferentiation into two zones, (i) a broader outer zone of narrower\r\nscalariform tracheae (_x ii_, fig. 248) in which 20 to 25 protoxylem\r\nstrands (_px_) occur just within the edge, (ii) an inner zone of\r\nbroader and shorter tracheae (fig. 248, _x i_). The protoxylem elements\r\n(_px_, fig. 248) are characterised by a single series of scalariform\r\npits, while the metaxylem elements have multiseriate pits like those\r\non the water-conducting elements of recent Osmundaceae. The tracheae\r\nshow an interesting histological character in the absence of the middle\r\nsubstance of their walls, a feature recognised by Gwynne-Vaughan[775]\r\nin many recent ferns. External to the xylem and separated from it\r\nby a parenchymatous sheath is a ring of phloem, _ph_, composed of\r\nlarge sieve-tubes and parenchyma separated from the inner cortex by a\r\npericycle 4 to 5 layers in breadth. The occurrence of a few sclerotic\r\ncells beyond the broad inner cortex points to the former existence of\r\na thick-walled outer cortex. The leaf-traces are given off as mesarch\r\nstrands from the edge of the xylem; they begin as prominences opposite\r\nthe protoxylem and become gradually detached as xylem bundles, at first\r\noblong in transverse section, then assuming a slightly crescentic and\r\nreniform shape, while the mesarch protoxylem strand takes up an endarch\r\nposition. As a trace passes further out the curvature increases and\r\nthe protoxylem strands undergo repeated bifurcation; it assumes in fact\r\nthe form and general type of structure met with in the leaf-traces of\r\n_Todea_ and _Osmunda_. Numerous diarch roots, given off from the stele\r\nat points just below the outgoing leaf-traces, pass outwards in a\r\nsinuous horizontal course through the cortex of the stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 248. _Zalesskya gracilis_ (Eich.).

(After\r\n  Kidston and Gwynne-Vaughan. × 2½.)]\r\n\r\nIn _Zalesskya gracilis_ the xylem cylinder was probably wider\r\nin the living plant than in the petrified stem. In _Zalesskya\r\ndiploxylon_[776], in all probability from the same Russian locality,\r\nthere can be little doubt that the xylem was originally solid to the\r\ncentre (fig. 249). In this species also the phloem forms a continuous\r\nband (_ph_, fig. 249) consisting of four to six layers of sieve-tubes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Thamnopteris_.\r\n\r\n_Thamnopteris Schlechtendalii_ (Eich.). Figs. 250, 312, A, Frontispiece.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 Brongniart[777] proposed the name _Thamnopteris_ for a species\r\nof fern from the Upper Permian of Russia originally described by\r\nEichwald as _Anomopteris Schlechtendalii_. A new name was employed by\r\nBrongniart on the ground that the fossil was not generically identical\r\nwith the species previously named by him _Anomopteris Mougeotii_[778].\r\nEichwald’s specimen has been thoroughly investigated by Kidston and\r\nGwynne-Vaughan[779]. The stem (Frontispiece) agrees in habit with\r\nthose of _Zalesskya_ and recent Osmundaceae; on the exposed leaf-bases\r\nthe action of the weather has etched out the horse-shoe form of the\r\nvascular strands and laid bare numerous branched roots boring their way\r\nthrough the petiole stumps. The centre of the stem is occupied by a\r\nprotostele 13 mm. in diameter consisting of solid xylem separated by a\r\nparenchymatous sheath from a cylinder of phloem. The xylem is composed\r\nmainly of an axial column of short and broad reticulately pitted\r\ntracheae (fig. 250, _b_ and Frontispiece), distinguished from the\r\nsharply contrasted peripheral zone of normal scalariform elements, _a_,\r\nby their thinner walls and more irregular shape. The protoxylem, _px_,\r\nis represented by groups of narrower elements rather deeply immersed in\r\nthe peripheral part of the metaxylem. A many-layered pericycle, _per_,\r\nand traces of an endodermis, _en_, succeed the phloem, _ph_, which is\r\ncharacterised by several rows of large contiguous sieve-tubes; beyond\r\nthe endodermis is a broad thin-walled inner cortex. The leaf-traces\r\narise as in _Zalesskya_, but the protoxylem in _Thamnopteris_ is at\r\nfirst central; as the trace passes outwards a group of parenchyma\r\nappears immediately internal to the protoxylem elements and gradually\r\nassumes the form of a bay of thin-walled tissue on the inner concave\r\nface of the curved xylem. The next stage is the repeated division of\r\nthe protoxylem strand until, in the sclerotic outer cortex, the traces\r\nacquire the Osmundaceous structure (fig. 312, A, p. 453). The petiole\r\nbases have stipular wings as in _Todea_ and _Osmunda_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 250. _Thamnopteris Schlechtendalii_ (Eich.). Part\r\n  of stele: _a_, outer xylem; _b_, inner xylem. (After Kidston and\r\n  Gwynne-Vaughan. × 13.)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OSMUNDACEAE]\r\n\r\nThe striking feature exhibited by these Permian plants is the structure\r\nof the protostele, which in _Thamnopteris_ and probably in _Zalesskya\r\ndiploxylon_ consists of solid xylem surrounded by phloem: this may be\r\nregarded as the primitive form of the Osmundaceous stele. In _Osmunda\r\nregalis_ and in other recent species of the genus the xylem cylinder\r\nhas the form of a lattice-work; in other words, the departure of\r\neach leaf-trace makes a gap in the xylem and the overlapping of the\r\nfoliar-gaps results in the separation of the xylem into a number\r\nof distinct bundles. In _Zalesskya gracilis_ the continuity of the\r\nxylem is not broken by overlapping gaps; in this it agrees with\r\n_Lepidodendron_. In _Thamnopteris_ the centre of the stele was occupied\r\nby a peculiar form of xylem obviously ill-adapted for conduction, but\r\nprobably serving for water-storage and comparable with the short and\r\nbroad tracheae in _Megaloxylon_[780]. There is clearly a well-marked\r\ndifference in stelar anatomy between these two Permian genera and\r\n_Todea_ and _Osmunda_: this difference appears less when viewed in\r\nthe light of the facts revealed by a study of the Jurassic species\r\n_Osmundites Dunlopi_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 251. _Lonchopteris virginiensis._ (After Fontaine.\r\n  ½ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nAs possible examples of Triassic Osmundaceae reference may be made\r\nto some species included in Stur’s genus _Speirocarpus_[781]. _S.\r\nvirginiensis_ was originally described by Fontaine[782] from the Upper\r\nTriassic rocks of Virginia as _Lonchopteris virginiensis_ (fig. 251)\r\nand has recently been figured by Leuthardt[783] from the Keuper of\r\nBasel. The sporangia, which are scattered over the lower surface of\r\nthe pinnules, are described as globose-elliptical and as having a\r\nrudimentary apical annulus; no figures have been published. In habit\r\nthe frond agrees with _Todites Williamsoni_, but the lateral veins form\r\nan anastomosing system like that in the Palaeozoic genus _Lonchopteris_\r\n(fig. 290, B). There would seem to be an _a priori_ probability of\r\nthis species being a representative of the Osmundaceae and not, as\r\nStur believed, of the Marattiaceae. Seeing that _Lonchopteris_ is\r\na designation of a purely provisional kind, it would be convenient\r\nto institute a new generic name for Triassic species having the\r\nLonchopteris venation, which there are good reasons for regarding as\r\nOsmundaceous ferns.\r\n\r\nSimilarly _Speirocarpus tenuifolius_ (Emmons) (= _Acrostichites\r\ntenuifolius_ Font.), which resembles _Todites Williamsoni_ (see p. 339)\r\nnot only in habit and in the distribution of the sporangia but also in\r\nthe venation, is probably an Osmundaceous species.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Osmundites._\r\n\r\n_Osmundites Dunlopi_, Kidston and Gwynne-Vaughan[784], fig. 252.\r\n\r\nThis species was found in Jurassic rocks in the Otago district of New\r\nZealand in association with _Cladophlebis denticulata_[785] (fig. 257).\r\nThe type-specimen forms part of a stem 17 mm. in diameter surrounded\r\nby a broad mass of crowded leaf-bases. The stele consists of an almost\r\ncontinuous xylem ring (fig. 252) enclosing a wide pith: the phloem and\r\ninner cortex are not preserved but the peripheral region of the stem is\r\noccupied by a sclerotic outer cortex. The mass of encasing leaf-bases\r\nresolves itself on closer inspection into zones of foliage-leaf\r\npetioles and the petioles of scale-leaves with an aborted lamina.\r\nA similar association of two forms of leaf is seen in the existing\r\nAmerican species _Osmunda Claytoniana_ and _O. cinnamomea_. The cortex\r\nand armour of leaf-bases are penetrated by numerous diarch roots.\r\nThe xylem cylinder, six to seven tracheae broad, is characterised\r\nby the narrower diameter of its innermost elements and—an important\r\npoint—by the fact that the detachment of a leaf-trace does not break\r\nthe continuity of the xylem cylinder (fig. 252). Each leaf-trace is\r\nat first elliptical in section; it then becomes curved inwards and\r\ngradually assumes the horse-shoe form as in _Zalesskya_ and in the\r\nrecent species. The single endarch protoxylem becomes subdivided until\r\nin the petiole it is represented by 20 or more strands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 252. _Osmundites Dunlopi_ Kidst. and G.-V. Portion\r\n  of xylem showing the departure of a leaf-trace. (After Kidston and\r\n  Gwynne-Vaughan; × 36.)]\r\n\r\nIn the continuity of the xylem cylinder this species of _Osmundites_\r\nshows a closer approach to _Todea barbara_ or _T. superba_ (fig. 221,\r\nB) than to species of _Osmunda_; it differs from _Zalesskya_ in having\r\nreached a further stage in the reduction of a solid protostele to one\r\ncomposed of a xylem cylinder enclosing a pith. This difference is of\r\nthe same kind as that which distinguishes the stele of _Lepidodendron\r\nrhodumnense_ from _L. Harcourtii_. In _Lepidodendron_ short tracheae\r\noccasionally occur on the inner edge of the xylem cylinder, and in\r\nrecent species of _Todea_ the same kind of reduced tracheae are met\r\nwith on the inner edge of the xylem[786]. In both cases the short\r\ntracheae are probably vestiges of an axial strand of conducting\r\nelements which in the course of evolution have been converted into\r\nparenchymatous cells. In _Lepidodendron vasculare_ the mixed parenchyma\r\nand short tracheae in the centre of the stele represent an intermediate\r\nstage in xylem reduction, and the arrangement in vertical rows of the\r\nmedullary parenchyma in _Lepidodendron_ is precisely similar to that\r\ndescribed by Kidston and Gwynne-Vaughan in _Thamnopteris_. In both\r\ncases the rows of superposed short cells have probably been produced\r\nby the transverse septation of cells which began by elongating as if to\r\nform conducting tubes and ended by assuming the form of vertical series\r\nof parenchymatous elements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 253. _Osmundites Kolbei_ Sew. (⅓ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nIn another Jurassic species, _Osmundites Gibbiana_[787], the xylem is\r\nof the _Osmunda_ type and consists of about 20 strands instead of a\r\ncontinuous or almost continuous cylinder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 254. _Osmundites Kolbei._ (Leaf-scars.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Osmundites Kolbei_ Seward, figs. 253–255.\r\n\r\nThis species was founded on a specimen obtained by Mr Kolbe from\r\nthe Uitenhage series of Cape Colony[788]. The fossil flora and fauna\r\nof this series point to its correlation with the Wealden or Neocomian\r\nstrata of Europe[789]. The type-specimen consists of several pieces\r\nof a stem (fig. 253) which reached a length of about 90 cm. On the\r\nweathered surface the remains of petiole-bases are clearly seen and\r\non the reverse side of the smaller piece shown in the figure numerous\r\nsinuous roots are present in association with the leaf-stalks. The\r\ndepression _c_ in the larger specimen may mark the position of a\r\nbranch: at _a_ fig. 253 (enlarged in fig. 254, _a_) the vascular strand\r\nof a petiole is exposed as a broad =U=-shaped band and at _b_ (fig.\r\n254, _b_) the form of the petiole-bases is clearly shown[790]. With the\r\nstem were found imperfectly preserved impressions of fronds referred to\r\n_Cladophlebis denticulata_, a common type of leaf which was found also\r\nin association with the slightly older New Zealand stem, _Osmundites\r\nDunlopi_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 255. _Osmundites Kolbei_ Sew. Transverse section,\r\n  from a photograph supplied by Dr Kidston and Mr Gwynne-Vaughan.\r\n  (2½ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nAn examination of the internal structure of the South African stem\r\nby Dr Kidston and Mr Gwynne-Vaughan has revealed many interesting\r\nfeatures, which will be fully described in Part IV. of their Monograph\r\non fossil Osmundaceous stems. I am greatly indebted to these authors\r\nfor allowing me to publish the following note contributed by Dr\r\nKidston:—\r\n\r\n“The section of _Osmundites Kolbei_ Seward, shown in fig. 255, presents\r\nthe usual appearance of an Osmundaceous stock. The parts contained in\r\nthis section are the stele, inner and outer cortex and a portion of\r\nthe surrounding mantle of concrescent leaf-bases. The whole specimen\r\nhas suffered much from pressure, but if restored to its original form\r\nthe xylem ring must have been about 19 mm. in diameter. The number of\r\nxylem strands is about fifty-six and several of them are more or less\r\njoined as in the modern genus _Todea_. The tracheae are of the typical\r\nOsmundaceous type, that is to say, the pits are actual perforations and\r\nseveral series of them occur on each wall of the larger tracheae.\r\n\r\n“The most interesting structural characteristic of _Osmundites Kolbei_\r\nis not well seen in the figure owing to the compression of the xylem\r\nring. This consists in the occurrence of tracheae in the pith. In fact,\r\nwe have here a mixed pith, composed of parenchyma and true tracheae,\r\na condition which connects the _Osmundaceae_ with a parenchymatous\r\nmedulla with those possessing a solid xylem stele like _Zalesskya_ and\r\n_Thamnopteris_ and so completes the series of transitions extending\r\nfrom the older and solid-steled forms to the modern medullated members\r\nof the _Osmundaceae_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Osmundites skidegatensis_, Penhallow.\r\n\r\nThis lower Cretaceous Canadian species, first described by\r\nPenhallow[791] and more recently by Kidston and Gwynne-Vaughan[792],\r\nis remarkable for the large size of the stem, the stele alone having\r\na diameter of 2·4 cm. Penhallow figures a fragment of a leaf bearing\r\na superficial resemblance to that of _Osmunda Claytoniana_, which\r\nmay be the foliage borne by _Osmundites skidegatensis_. The xylem\r\ncylinder is broken by the exit of leaf-traces into 50 or more strands\r\nvarying in size and shape, and it is noteworthy that the phloem is also\r\ninterrupted as each leaf-trace is given off. In recent species the\r\nxylem cylinder is almost always interrupted, but the phloem retains its\r\ncontinuity. In the Canadian fossil an internal band of phloem occurs\r\nbetween the xylem and the pith, and this joins the external phloem at\r\neach leaf-gap. This internal phloem finds an interesting parallel in\r\ncertain recent species[793], but in these the internal and external\r\nphloem do not meet at the foliar gaps as they do in the extinct type.\r\nIn _Osmunda cinnamomea_ the internal phloem occurs only at the regions\r\nof branching of the stem stele; in the fossil it is always present.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that _Osmundites skidegatensis_ represents the most complex\r\ntype of stem so far recognised in the Osmundaceae; it illustrates a\r\nstage in elaboration of the primitive protostele in advance of that\r\nreached by any existing species.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nThe primitive Osmundaceous stele was composed of solid xylem surrounded\r\nby phloem (_Thamnopteris_ and _Zalesskya_); at a later stage the xylem\r\ncylinder lost its inner zone of wide and short tracheae and assumed\r\nthe form seen in _Osmundites Kolbei_, in which the centre of the stele\r\nconsists of parenchyma with some tracheae. Another type is represented\r\nby _O. Dowkeri_ in which the pith is composed wholly of parenchyma\r\nand the xylem ring is continuous. From this type, by expansion of the\r\nxylem ring and by the formation of overlapping leaf-gaps, the form\r\nrepresented by _Osmunda regalis_ was reached. _Osmunda cinnamomea_,\r\nwith internal phloem in the regions of stelar branching, probably\r\nrepresents a further stage, as Kidston and Gwynne-Vaughan believe, in\r\nincreasing complexity due to the introduction of phloem from without\r\nthrough gaps produced by the branching of the stele. In _Osmundites\r\nskidegatensis_ the leaf-gaps became wider and the external phloem\r\nprojected deeper into the stele until a continuous internal phloem\r\nzone was produced. This most elaborate type proved less successful than\r\nthe simpler forms which still survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Osmundites Sturii._\r\n\r\nImpressions of fertile pinnae with narrow linear segments bearing\r\nexannulate sporangia described by Raciborski from Lower Jurassic rocks\r\nin Poland as _Osmunda Sturii_[794] may with some hesitation be included\r\nin the list of Mesozoic Osmundaceae.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Osmundites Dowkeri._\r\n\r\nUnder this name Carruthers[795] described a petrified stem from\r\nLower Eocene beds at Herne Bay, which in the structure of the stele\r\nagrees closely with the Jurassic species _O. Gibbiana_ and conforms\r\nto the normal Osmundaceous type. It is possible, as Gardner and\r\nEttingshausen[796] suggested, that the foliage of this species may be\r\nrepresented by some sterile _Osmunda_-like fragments recorded from\r\nthe Middle Bagshot beds of Bovey Tracey and Bournemouth as _Osmunda\r\nlignitum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Todites._\r\n\r\nThis generic name[797] has been applied to fossil ferns exhibiting in\r\nthe structure of the sporangia and in the general habit of the fertile\r\nfronds a close resemblance to the recent species _Todea barbara_ (fig.\r\n221, D, p. 286).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Todites Williamsoni_ (Brongniart) figs. 256, B, C, G.\r\n\r\n  1828. _Pecopteris Williamsonis_, Brongniart, Prodrome, p. 57; Hist.\r\n        vég. foss., p. 324, Pl.

Specimens from the Rhaetic may\r\nnot be specifically identical with those from the Jurassic; the main\r\npoint is that, whether actually identical or not, both sets of fossils\r\nclearly represent the same general type of Osmundaceous fern[798] and\r\nmay for present purposes be included under the same designation. The\r\nabove synonymy, though by no means complete[799], serves to illustrate\r\nthe confusion which has existed in regard to this widely spread type of\r\nMesozoic fern.\r\n\r\n_Todites Williamsoni_ may be briefly described as follows:—\r\n\r\n  Frond bipinnate; long linear pinnae (20–30 cm.) of uniform breadth\r\n  arise at an acute angle, or in the lower part of a frond, almost at\r\n  right angles, from a stout rachis. Closely set pinnules attached\r\n  by a broad base; slightly falcate, the side towards the rachis\r\n  strongly convex and the outer margin straight or concave and\r\n  bulged outwards towards the base of each segment, margin usually\r\n  entire, or it may be slightly lobed. Fertile pinnules similar to\r\n  the sterile; sporangia of the Osmundaceous type and often scattered\r\n  over the whole lower surface of the lamina (fig. 256, B, B′, G).\r\n  Venation of the _Cladophlebis_ type (cf. fig. 256, A).\r\n\r\nIt is not always easy to distinguish _Todites Williamsoni_ from\r\n_Cladophlebis denticulata_, another common Jurassic fern, but in the\r\nlatter the pinnules are usually longer and relatively narrower and\r\nthe rachis is more slender (cf. fig. 256, B and 257). Schenk[800] and\r\nRaciborski[801] have shown that the sporangia of _Todites_ conform\r\nin the absence of a true annulus to those of _Todea_ (fig. 256, G)\r\nand _Osmunda_. Nathorst[802] has recently figured a group of spores\r\nof _Todites Williamsoni_ in illustration of the use of the treatment\r\nof carbonised impressions with nitric acid and potassium chlorate.\r\nThis species, though widely distributed in Jurassic rocks, is hardly\r\ndistinguishable from the German Rhaetic fronds figured by Schenk from\r\nBayreuth as _Acrostichites Goeppertianus_[803], or from other fossils\r\nreferred to an unnecessarily large number of species by Fontaine[804]\r\nfrom Upper Triassic rocks of Virginia[805].\r\n\r\nIt would seem from the paucity of later records of Osmundaceae that\r\nthe family reached its zenith in the Jurassic era. When we pass to\r\nthe later Tertiary and more recent deposits evidence is afforded in\r\nregard to the geographical range of _Osmunda regalis_. It has been\r\nshown to occur in the Pliocene forest-bed of Norfolk[806] as well as in\r\nPalaeolithic and Neolithic deposits[807].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 257. _Cladophlebis denticulata._ (From a specimen\r\n  in the British Museum from the Inferior Oolite rocks of Yorkshire.\r\n  Slightly reduced.)]\r\n\r\nA fertile frond from the Molteno (Rhaetic) beds of South Africa\r\nreferred to _Cladophlebis_ (_Todites_) _Roesserti_ (Presl)[808]\r\nrepresents in all probability an Osmundaceous fern closely allied to\r\n_Todites Williamsoni_. The same species is described by Zeiller[809]\r\nfrom Rhaetic rocks of Tonkin and very similar types are figured by\r\nLeuthardt[810] from Upper Triassic rocks of Basel as _Pecopteris\r\nRutimeyeri_ Heer, and by Fontaine[811] from rocks of the same age in\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Cladophlebis._\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Cladophlebis_ was instituted by Brongniart for\r\nMesozoic fern fronds characterised by ultimate segments of linear or\r\nmore or less falcate form attached to the pinnae by the whole of the\r\nbase, as in the Palaeozoic genus _Pecopteris_, possessing a midrib\r\nstrongly marked at the base and dividing towards the distal end of the\r\nlamina into finer branches and giving off secondary forked and arched\r\nveins at an acute angle. The term is generally restricted to Mesozoic\r\nfern fronds which, on account of the absence or imperfection of fertile\r\npinnae, cannot be safely assigned to a particular family. In the case\r\nof the species described below, the evidence in regard to systematic\r\nposition, though not conclusive, is sufficiently strong to justify its\r\ninclusion in the Osmundaceae.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cladophlebis denticulata_ Brongniart. Figs. 256, A; 257, 258.\r\n\r\n  1828. _Pecopteris denticulata_[812], Brongniart, Prodrome, p. 57;\r\n        Hist. vég. foss. p. 301, Pl. XCVIII. figs. 1, 2.\r\n\r\n   —    _P. Phillipsii_, Brongniart, Hist. p. 304, Pl. CIX. fig. 1.\r\n\r\nThis species is often confused[813] with _Todites Williamsoni_. The\r\nname _Pecopteris whitbiensis_ has been used by different writers for\r\nJurassic fronds which are undoubtedly specifically distinct: specimens\r\nso named by Brongniart should be referred to _Todites Williamsoni_,\r\nwhile _P. whitbiensis_ of Lindley and Hutton[814] is Brongniart’s\r\n_Cladophlebis denticulata_. It is impossible to determine with accuracy\r\nthe numerous examples described as _Pecopteris whitbiensis_, _Asplenium\r\nwhitbiense_, _Cladophlebis Albertsii_ (a Wealden species[815]),\r\n_Asplenium_, or _Cladophlebis_, _nebbense_[816], etc., from Jurassic\r\nand Rhaetic strata. The _Cladophlebis denticulata_ form of frond is one\r\nof the commonest in recent ferns; it is represented by such species as\r\n_Onoclea Struthopteris_, _Pteris arguta_, _Sadleria sp._, _Gleichenia\r\ndubia_, _Alsophila lunulata_, _Cyathea dealbata_, and species of\r\n_Polypodium_. It is, therefore, not surprising to find records of this\r\nMesozoic species from many localities and horizons. All that we can do\r\nis to point out what appear to be the most probable cases of identity\r\namong the numerous examples of fronds of this type from Mesozoic rocks,\r\nparticularly Rhaetic and Jurassic, in different parts of the world.\r\nThe name _Cladophlebis denticulata_ may be employed in a comprehensive\r\nsense for fronds showing the following characters:—\r\n\r\n  Leaf large, bipinnate, with long spreading pinnae borne on a\r\n  comparatively slender rachis. Pinnules, in nearly all cases,\r\n  sterile, reaching a length of 3–4cm., acutely pointed, finely\r\n  denticulate or entire, attached by the whole of the base (fig.\r\n  257). In the apical region the pinnules become shorter and broader.\r\n  Venation of the _Cladophlebis_ type (fig. 256, A). Fertile pinnules\r\n  rather straighter than the sterile, characterised by linear sori\r\n  parallel to the lateral veins (fig. 258).\r\n\r\nIn endeavouring to distinguish specifically between fronds showing a\r\ngeneral agreement in habit with _C. denticulata_, special attention\r\nshould be paid to venation characters, the shape of the pinnules,\r\nthe relation of the two edges of the lamina to one another, and to\r\nthe amount of curvature of the whole pinnule. Unless the material is\r\nabundant, it is often impossible to distinguish between characters of\r\nspecific value and others which are the expression of differences in\r\nage or of position on a large frond, to say nothing of the well-known\r\nvariability which is amply illustrated by recent ferns. It is\r\nremarkable that very few specimens are known which throw any light on\r\nthe nature of the fertile pinnae. Fig. 258 represents an impression\r\nfrom the Inferior Oolite rocks of the Yorkshire coast in which the\r\nexposed upper surface of the pinnules shows a series of parallel ridges\r\nfollowing the course of the lateral veins and no doubt formed by\r\noblong sori on the lower surface. There can be little doubt that the\r\nspecimen figured by Lindley and Hutton and by others as _Pecopteris\r\nundans_[817] is, as Nathorst suggests, a portion of a fertile frond of\r\n_C. denticulata_. A fertile specimen of a frond resembling in habit\r\n_C. denticulata_, which Fontaine has described from the Jurassic\r\nrocks of Oregon as _Danaeopsis Storrsii_[818], exhibits, as that\r\nauthor points out, a superficial resemblance to the specimen named by\r\nLindley and Hutton _Pecopteris undans_. There is, however, no adequate\r\nreason for referring the American fragment to the Marattiaceae. In the\r\nabsence of sporangia we cannot speak confidently as to the systematic\r\nposition of this common type; but there are fairly good grounds for\r\nthe assertion that some at least of the fronds described under this\r\nname are those of Osmundaceae. The English specimen shown in fig.\r\n258 is very similar to some Indian fossils figured by Feistmantel\r\nas _Asplenites macrocarpus_[819], which are probably identical with\r\n_Pecopteris australis_ Morris[820], a fern that is indistinguishable\r\nfrom _Cladophlebis denticulata_. Renault[821] figured a fertile\r\nspecimen of the Australian fossil as _Todea australis_, which agrees\r\nvery closely with that shown in fig. 258, and the sporangia figured\r\nby the French author are of the Osmundaceous type. Another example\r\nof a fertile specimen is afforded by a Rhaetic fern from Franconia,\r\n_Asplenites ottonis_, which is probably identical with _Alethopteris\r\nRoesserti_ Presl [= _Cladophlebis_ (_Todites_) _Roesserti_], a plant\r\nclosely resembling _Cladophlebis denticulata_. Another argument in\r\nfavour of including _C. denticulata_ in the Osmundaceae is supplied\r\nby the association of pinnae of this type with the petrified stem of\r\n_Osmundites Dunlopi_ recorded by Kidston and Gwynne-Vaughan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 258. Fertile pinnae of _Cladophlebis denticulata_.\r\n  (From a Yorkshire specimen in the Sedgwick Museum, Cambridge.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =Schizaeaceae.=\r\n\r\nEvidence bearing on the existence of this family in Carboniferous\r\nfloras is by no means decisive. The generic name _Aneimites_ proposed\r\nby Dawson[822] for some Devonian Canadian plants resembling species of\r\nthe recent genus _Aneimia_, and adopted by White[823] for a species\r\nfrom the Pottsville beds of Virginia, is misleading. The Canadian\r\nplants give no indication of the nature of the reproductive organs, and\r\nthe fronds described by White are, as he shows, those of a Pteridosperm\r\nand bore seeds.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the suspiciously diagrammatic drawings published by\r\nCorda[824] of the small fertile pinnules of a Carboniferous fern from\r\nBohemia, which he named _Senftenbergia elegans_, leads us to conclude\r\nthat the sporangia are almost certainly those of a Schizaeaceous\r\nspecies. The small linear pinnules bear two rows of sessile sporangia,\r\nsingly as in recent Schizaeaceae and not in sori, characterised by\r\n4–5 rows of regular annular cells (fig. 270, A) surrounding the apex.\r\nIt has already been pointed out that the apical annulus of recent\r\nSchizaeaceae, though normally one row deep, may consist in part at\r\nleast of two rows. Zeiller[825] examined specimens of Corda’s species\r\nand decided in favour of a Schizaeaceous affinity; he describes the\r\nsporangia as 0·85–0·95 mm. in length, with 3 to 5 and occasionally only\r\ntwo rows of cells in the apical annulus. Zeiller’s figures (fig. 270,\r\nA) confirm the impression that Corda’s drawings are more beautiful than\r\naccurate. Stur[826], on the other hand, who first pointed out that the\r\ntype-specimens of _Senftenbergia_ came from the Radnitz beds of Bohemia\r\nand not from the Coal-Measures, convinced himself that the sporangia\r\nhave no true annulus (fig. 270, E). He describes them as characterised\r\nby a comparatively strong wall and by the presence of a band of narrow\r\nvertical cells marking the line of dehiscence, features which lead\r\nhim to assign the plant to the Marattiales, a group which seems to\r\nhave exercised a dominating influence over his judgment. In a later\r\npublication Zeiller[827] replies to Stur’s criticism but adheres to\r\nhis original opinion. Solms-Laubach[828], while expressing himself in\r\nfavour of Marattiaceous affinity, recognises that Zeiller’s arguments\r\ncannot be set aside.\r\n\r\nThe question must remain open until further evidence is forthcoming;\r\nbut it would seem that this Carboniferous type, not as yet recognised\r\nin Britain, possessed sporangia having a distinct resemblance to those\r\nof the Schizaeaceae, though this similarity does not amount to proof of\r\nthe existence of the family in the Palaeozoic era.\r\n\r\nPalaeozoic floras may be described as rich in generalised types,\r\ntypes foreshadowing lines of evolution, which in the course of ages\r\nled to a sorting and a redistribution of characters. It may be that\r\n_Senftenbergia_ is one of these generalised types.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nIt is not until we ascend the geological series as far as the older\r\nJurassic rocks that we meet with a type which can with confidence be\r\nclassed with the Schizaeaceae, as least so far as sporangial characters\r\nare concerned. The species _Klukia exilis_ is selected as the best\r\nknown and most widely-spread representative of Jurassic Schizaeaceae.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Klukia exilis_ (Phillips)[829]. Fig. 259.\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Klukia_ was proposed by Raciborski[830] for a species\r\noriginally described by Phillips[831] from the Inferior Oolite of\r\nthe Yorkshire coast as _Pecopteris exilis_. Bunbury’s[832] discovery\r\n(supplemented by additional evidence obtained by Raciborski) of\r\nwell-preserved sporangia justified the substitution of a distinctive\r\ndesignation for the provisional term _Pecopteris_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 259. _Klukia exilis_ (Phillips). (Figs. 1–3, × 40;\r\n  fig. 4, × 3; fig. 5, nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nThe species may be defined as follows:—\r\n\r\n  Frond tripinnate, of the _Cladophlebis_ type; pinnae linear,\r\n  lanceolate, attached to the rachis at a wide angle. Ultimate\r\n  segments short and linear, entire or, in the lower part of a frond,\r\n  crenulate, 5 mm. long or occasionally longer. Sporangia 0·5 mm. in\r\n  length, borne singly on the lower surface of the lamina in a row on\r\n  each side of the midrib.\r\n\r\nA re-examination[833] of the specimen described by Bunbury confirmed\r\nhis account of the structure of the sporangia. The pinna shown in\r\nfig. 259 is characterised by unusually small fertile pinnules some\r\nof which bear 10 sporangia in two rows; the annulus includes about\r\n14 cells. Fertile specimens of this and similar forms are figured by\r\nRaciborski[834] from Jurassic rocks of Poland, and good examples of the\r\nEnglish species may be seen in the Leckenby collection, Cambridge, in\r\nthe British Museum, the museums of Manchester, Scarborough, and other\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that specimens referred to _K. exilis_ by Yokoyama[835]\r\nfrom Wealden strata in Japan may afford evidence of the persistence\r\nof the species beyond the Jurassic era, but in view of the close\r\nresemblance of the sterile fronds described from Wealden strata as\r\n_Cladophlebis Brownii_[836] and _C. Dunkeri_[836] to those of _Klukia\r\nexilis_, identity can be established only by an examination of fertile\r\nspecimens. A Jurassic fern recently described by Yabe[837] from Korea\r\nas _Cladophlebis koraiensis_ may be identical with _K. exilis_ and\r\nthere is little doubt as to the existence of the species in Jurassic\r\nCaucasian strata[838].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 260. _Ruffordia Goepperti_. (A, C, sterile; B,\r\n  fertile; slightly reduced. Specimens from the Wealden of Sussex;\r\n  British Museum; V. 2333, V. 2160, V. 2166.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ruffordia Goepperti_ (Dunk.). Fig. 260.\r\n\r\nThis Wealden fern[839] has been doubtfully assigned to the Schizaeaceae\r\non the ground of the resemblance of the sterile fronds to those of some\r\nspecies of _Aneimia_, and because of the difference between the sterile\r\nand fertile pinnae (Fig. 260). _Ruffordia_ cannot be regarded as a well\r\nauthenticated member of the Schizaeaceae.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 261.\r\n\r\n  A, A′. _Chrysodium lanzaeanum._\r\n  B, B′. _Lygodium Kaulfussi._\r\n  C. _Marattia Hookeri._\r\n\r\n  (After Gardner and Ettingshausen; A, B, ¾ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lygodium Kaulfussi_, Heer. Fig. 261, B, B′.\r\n\r\nFragments of forked pinnules, agreeing very closely in venation and\r\ngeneral appearance with recent species of _Lygodium_, have been\r\nidentified by Gardner and Ettingshausen[840] from English Eocene beds\r\nand by Knowlton from the Miocene beds of the Yellowstone Park[841]\r\nas _Lygodium Kaulfussi_ Heer (fig. 261, B). Despite the absence of\r\nsporangia it is probable that these fragments are correctly referred\r\nto the Schizaeaceae. The sterile and fertile specimens figured by\r\nHeer[842] from Tertiary beds of Switzerland agree very closely with\r\nrecent examples of _Lygodium_. Similar though perhaps less convincing\r\nevidence of the existence of this family in Europe is furnished by\r\nSaporta[843], who described two Eocene species from France.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           =Gleicheniaceae.=\r\n\r\nThe application by Goeppert[844] and other earlier writers of the\r\ngeneric name _Gleichenites_ to examples of Palaeozoic ferns was not\r\njustified by any satisfactory evidence. One of Goeppert’s species,\r\n_Gleichenites neuropteroides_, is identical with _Neuropteris\r\nheterophylla_[845], a plant now included in the Pteridosperms.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance of sporangia and sori, whether preserved as carbonised\r\nimpressions or as petrified material, from Carboniferous rocks, to\r\nthose of recent species of Gleicheniaceae is in many cases at least the\r\nresult of misinterpretation of deceptive appearances. Williamson[846]\r\ndrew attention to the Gleichenia-like structure of some sections of\r\nsporangia from the English Coal-Measures, but he did not realise the\r\nease with which sections of Marattiaceous sporangia in different planes\r\nmay be mistaken for those of annulate (leptosporangiate) sporangia.\r\nIn the regular dichotomous habit of Carboniferous fronds described as\r\nspecies of _Diplothmema_ (Stur) and _Mariopteris_ (Zeiller)[847] we\r\nhave a close correspondence with the leaves of _Gleichenia_, but the\r\ncommon occurrence of dichotomous branching among ferns is sufficient\r\nreason for regarding this feature as an untrustworthy criterion of\r\nrelationship. It is, however, interesting to find that in addition\r\nto the existence of some Upper Carboniferous ferns with sori like\r\nthose of recent Gleichenias, the type of stelar anatomy illustrated\r\nby _Gleichenia dicarpa_ (fig. 237, C, p. 310) and other species is\r\ncharacteristic of the primary structure of the stem of the Pteridosperm\r\n_Heterangium_. We find in Carboniferous types undoubted indications of\r\nanatomical and other features which in succeeding ages became the marks\r\nof Gleicheniaceae.\r\n\r\nSome Carboniferous fronds with short and small pinnules of the\r\n_Pecopteris_ type, bearing sori composed of a small number of\r\nsporangia, have been assigned by Grand’Eury and other authors to the\r\nGleicheniaceae; the same form of sorus is met with also on fronds with\r\nSphenopteroid segments. The former is illustrated by _Oligocarpia\r\nGutbieri_[848] and the latter by _O. Brongniarti_ described by Stur\r\nand by Zeiller[849]. Zeiller has described the circular sori of\r\n_Oligocarpia_ (fig. 270, B) as consisting of three to ten pyriform\r\nsporangia borne at the ends of lateral veins and possessing a complete\r\ntransverse annulus, but Stur[850] believes that the annulus-like\r\nappearance is due to the manner of preservation of exannulate\r\nsporangia. In this opinion Stur is supported by Solms-Laubach[851]\r\nand by Schenk[852]. Despite an agreement between _Oligocarpia_\r\nand _Gleichenia_, as regards the form of the sori and the number\r\nof sporangia, it is not certain that the existence of a typical\r\nGleicheniaceous annulus has been proved to occur in any Palaeozoic\r\nsporangia[853].\r\n\r\nFrom Upper Triassic beds of Virginia, Fontaine has figured several\r\nfronds for which he instituted the genus _Mertensides_[854]. The habit,\r\nas he points out, is not dichotomous, but the sori are circular and\r\nare said to be composed in some species of four to six sporangia. No\r\nsatisfactory evidence is brought forward in support of the use of a\r\ndesignation implying a close relationship with recent Gleichenias\r\n(sect. _Mertensia_). One of the species described by Fontaine was\r\noriginally named by Bunbury _Pecopteris bullatus_[855], the imperfect\r\ntype-specimen of which is now in the Museum of the Cambridge Botany\r\nSchool. In the form of the frond, the thick rachis, and in the pinnules\r\nthis Triassic species resembles _Todites Williamsoni_, but the\r\nresemblance does not extend to the sori. Two of Fontaine’s species are\r\nrecorded by Stur from Austria[856], but he places them in the genus\r\n_Oligocarpia_ and includes them in the Marattiaceae.\r\n\r\nLeuthardt[857] figures what appears to be a Gleicheniaceous fern from\r\nthe Upper Triassic beds of Basel as _Gleichenites gracilis_ (Heer)\r\nshowing sori composed of five sporangia (fig. 265, C) with a horizontal\r\nannulus. A Rhaetic species _Gleichenites microphyllus_ Schenk[858]\r\nfrom Franconia agrees in the form of its small rounded pinnules with\r\n_Gleichenia_, but no sporangia have so far been found.\r\n\r\nAn impression of a frond from Jurassic rocks of northern Italy figured\r\nby Zigno as _Gleichenites elegans_[859] closely resembles in habit\r\nrecent species of _Gleichenia_; though no sporangia have been found,\r\nthe habit of the frond gives probability to Zigno’s determination.\r\n\r\nA Jurassic species from Poland, _Gleichenites Rostafinskii_, referred\r\nby Raciborski[860] to _Gleichenia_, exhibits a close agreement in habit\r\nand in the form of the soral impressions to some recent species of\r\n_Gleichenia_.\r\n\r\nAs we pass upwards to Wealden and more recent rocks it becomes clear\r\nthat the Gleicheniaceae were prominent members of late Mesozoic floras\r\nin north Europe and reached as far north as Disco Island. In English\r\nWealden beds portions of sterile fronds have been found which were\r\nassigned to a new genus _Leckenbya_[861], but it is probable that these\r\nspecimens would be more correctly referred to _Gleichenites_. Similarly\r\nfragments of Gleichenia-like pinnae with very small rounded pinnules\r\noccur in the Wealden rocks of Bernissart, Belgium[862], in north\r\nGermany[863], and elsewhere. Conclusive evidence has been obtained by\r\nProf. Bommer of the existence of _Gleichenites_ in Wealden beds near\r\nBrussels, where many plant remains have been found in a wonderful\r\nstate of preservation. The specimens, which I had an opportunity of\r\nseeing some years ago, might easily be mistaken for rather old and\r\nbrown pieces of recent plants. Some of the Belgian fragments, of\r\nwhich Prof. Bommer has kindly sent me drawings and photographs, are\r\ncharacterised by an arrangement of vascular tissue identical with that\r\nin the petioles and rhizomes of some protostelic Gleichenias. The stele\r\nof one of the Belgian rhizomes appears to be identical with that of\r\n_Gleichenia dicarpa_ (fig. 237, C. p. 310).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 262.\r\n\r\n  A. _Gleichenites longipennis_ Heer.\r\n  B. _G. delicatula_ Heer.\r\n  C. _G.

Fig. 262, D.\r\n\r\nThis species, originally described by Corda as _Pecopteris Zippei_[864]\r\nand afterwards figured by Heer[865] as _Gleichenia Zippei_ (fig. 262,\r\nD) from Urgonian rocks of Greenland, affords a striking example of a\r\nMesozoic member of the _Gleicheniaceae_. It is characterised by the\r\ndichotomous branching of the frond and by the occurrence of arrested\r\nbuds in the forks. The long and slender pinnae, reaching a length of 9\r\ncm. and a breadth of 6–8 mm., bear small crowded pinnules occasionally\r\nwith circular sori which are described by Heer as consisting of a small\r\nnumber of sporangia (cf. fig. 262, C). Several other Lower Cretaceous\r\nspecies are recorded by Heer from Greenland, some of which are probably\r\nunnecessarily separated from _Gleichenites Zippei_. Examples of these\r\nare represented in fig. 262, A, B, C.\r\n\r\nA Gleicheniaceous species described by Debey and Ettingshausen\r\nfrom Lower Cretaceous rocks of Aix-la-Chapelle as _Didymosorus\r\ncomptonifolius_[866] is very similar in habit to some of Heer’s\r\nGreenland species: this should probably be referred to the genus\r\n_Gleichenites_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gleichenites hantonensis_, Wank. Fig. 263.\r\n\r\nFrom the Eocene beds of Bournemouth, Gardner and Ettingshausen[867]\r\nhave described under the name _Gleichenia hantonensis_ what is in all\r\nprobability a true _Gleichenia_ (fig. 263). This species, originally\r\nrecorded by Wanklyn[868], is characterised by a slender forked rachis\r\nshowing what may be traces of arrested buds between the arms of the\r\nbranches, by circular sori of six or eight sporangia and by the\r\npresence of peculiar tendril-like appendages on the pinnae. If the\r\ndescription of the tendrils is correct, this British species affords\r\none of the few instances of ferns adapted for climbing and may be\r\ncompared with the recent species _Davallia aculeata_ (fig. 232, p. 299).\r\n\r\n\r\n                             =Matonineae.=\r\n\r\nThe genera _Laccopteris_ and _Matonidium_ may be described as examples\r\nof Mesozoic ferns exhibiting a very close agreement with _Matonia_.\r\n\r\n_Laccopteris_. This genus, founded by Presl[869], may be described as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n  Frond pedate, in habit resembling _Matonia pectinata_, with\r\n  pinnate or pinnatifid pinnae; ultimate segments linear, provided\r\n  with a well-marked midrib giving off numerous dichotomously\r\n  branched secondary veins which are in places connected by lateral\r\n  anastomoses. Sori circular, forming a single row on each side of\r\n  the midrib (fig. 278, B); sporangia 5–15 in each sorus, with an\r\n  oblique annulus and tetrahedral spores. The presence of an indusium\r\n  is not certainly established.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 263. _Gleichenites hantonensis_ Wank. (Restoration,\r\n  after Gardner and Ettingshausen.)]\r\n\r\nSchenk[870], who described several specimens of _Laccopteris_ from\r\nRhaetic rocks of Germany, compared the genus with _Gleichenia_ but\r\nhe also recognised the close resemblance to _Matonia pectinata_.\r\nZeiller[871] first established the practical identity of the sori and\r\nsporangia of _Laccopteris_ and _Matonia_. The Rhaetic species, such as\r\n_L. Muensteri_, _L. elegans_, and _L. Goepperti_, agree very closely\r\nwith _L. polypodioides_ and need not be described in detail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 264. _Laccopteris elegans_ (Presl).

The form of the sorus of another Rhaetic species is\r\nshown in fig. 265, E. Schenk figures an interesting series of fronds of\r\n_L.

An examination of Rhaetic specimens\r\nof _Laccopteris_ in the Bergakademie of Berlin convinced me of the\r\ncorrectness of the published descriptions of the sori.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 265.\r\n\r\n  A. _Matonidium Wiesneri._ (Slightly enlarged.)\r\n  B. _Marattiopsis marantacea._ (Slightly enlarged.)\r\n  C. _Gleichenites gracilis._ (Slightly enlarged.)\r\n  D. _Laccopteris Goepperti._ (Slightly reduced.)\r\n  E. _L.

Circular sori (indusiate?)\r\noccur in a single row on each side of the midrib containing 12–14 large\r\nsporangia (fig. 266) characterised by an obliquely vertical annulus.\r\nThe midrib of the pinnules gives off secondary veins at a wide angle\r\nand these form a series of elongated meshes parallel to the median rib,\r\nas in the recent genus _Woodwardia_; forked and anastomosing branches\r\nare given off from these to the edge of the lamina (fig. 267).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 267. Pinnules of _Laccopteris_.  (Enlarged.)\r\n\r\n  A, B. From the Inferior Oolite of Yorkshire.\r\n  C. From the Inferior Oolite of Stamford.

Similarly, specimens described by Debey and\r\nEttingshausen[877] from Lower Cretaceous rocks of Aix-la-Chapelle as\r\nspecies of _Carolopteris_ may also be included in _Laccopteris_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 268. ? _Laccopteris polypodioides._ Nat. size. From\r\n  a specimen in the Whitby Museum (Brit. Mus.).]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Laccopteris Dunkeri_ (Schenk)[878].\r\n\r\nThis species is represented in several Wealden localities by fragments\r\nof fertile pinnae similar to those of _L. polypodioides_. It is almost\r\nimpossible to distinguish small specimens of the Wealden fern from\r\nHeer’s genus _Nathorstia_ (Marattiaceae) unless the sori are well\r\npreserved. This species occurs in Wealden beds in England, Germany,\r\nBelgium, and elsewhere and has been discovered by Dr Marcus Gunn in\r\nUpper Jurassic plant-beds of Sutherlandshire (N.E. Scotland).\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\n_Laccopteris_ is widely spread in Rhaetic, Jurassic and Lower\r\nCretaceous floras. It affords evidence of the former abundance in\r\nnorthern latitudes of a family now represented by the two species of\r\n_Matonia_ confined to a restricted area in the southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Matonidium._\r\n\r\nSchenk[879] instituted this convenient term for fossil fern fronds\r\nagreeing in habit and in their sori with _Matonia pectinata_ (figs.\r\n227, 228, p. 292). Zeiller[880] has drawn attention to the fact\r\nthat the Mesozoic species differ from the surviving types in the\r\ngreater number of sporangia in each sorus, and, it may be added,\r\nin _Matonidium_ the fertile pinnules are more richly supplied with\r\nsori than are those of _Matonia_. Unfortunately our knowledge of the\r\nstructure of the sporangia of _Matonidium_ is less complete than in the\r\ncase of _Laccopteris_, but such evidence as is available justifies the\r\nconclusion that _Matonia_ is a direct descendant of ferns which formed\r\na prominent feature in European Jurassic and Wealden floras. It is\r\ninteresting to find that in a Cretaceous species, described by Krasser\r\n(fig. 265, A) since the publication of Zeiller’s paper, the sori appear\r\nto be identical in distribution and in appearance with those of the\r\nrecent species.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Prof. Bommer for permission to reproduce the\r\nunpublished drawing represented in fig. 237 D (p. 310) of a section of\r\nthe rhizome of _Matonidium_ from the Belgian Wealden beds of Hainaut\r\n(“Flore Bernissartienne”). The section shows an arrangement of vascular\r\ntissue identical with that in the recent species: there may be two\r\nsolenosteles and in addition a solid axial strand. The form of the\r\nleaf-trace in the fossil appears to be identical with that in _Matonia\r\npectinata_ (fig. 237, A, p. 310).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Matonidium Goepperti_ (Ettingshausen)[881]. Fig. 269.\r\n\r\nUnder this name are included specimens from Inferior Oolite and Wealden\r\nstrata in Britain and elsewhere. It is, however, not impossible that if\r\nmore information were available, we should find adequate reasons for\r\nrecognising two specific types. Fontaine[882], adhering rigidly to the\r\nrules of priority, speaks of this species as _Matonidium Althausii_\r\n(Dunker), but Ettingshausen’s specific term is better known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 269. _Matonidium Goepperti_ (Ettings.). (A, B, ½\r\n  nat. size; C, approximately nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n  Fronds pedate and apparently identical in habit with those of\r\n  _Matonia pectinata_; ultimate segments linear, slightly falcate and\r\n  bluntly pointed. Sori circular or oval, numerous, containing 15\r\n  to 20 sporangia with an oblique annulus, in two rows on the lower\r\n  surface of the pinnules; indusium as in _Matonia_.\r\n\r\nThe English examples have so far afforded no information in regard to\r\nsporangial structure, but Schenk[883] has recognised a distinct annulus\r\nin German material. In his description of fossil plants from Lower\r\nCretaceous rocks in California, Fontaine[884] doubtfully identifies\r\ntwo very small fragments as _Matonidium Althausii_; the evidence is,\r\nhowever, wholly inadequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Matonidium Wiesneri_, Krasser[885]. Fig. 265, A.\r\n\r\nThis Cenomanian (Cretaceous) species from Moravia appears to be\r\nidentical in habit with the older type. The pinnules are larger and\r\nbear fewer sori. Krasser’s figures of the sterile pinnules show no\r\nlateral anastomosing between the secondary veins, but the small\r\nvascular network below each sorus (fig. 265, A) is identical with that\r\nin _Matonia pectinata_. The indusiate sori contain about six sporangia\r\nwith an oblique annulus.\r\n\r\nThe very wide geographical distribution of the Matonineae during the\r\nMesozoic era affords a striking contrast to the limited range of the\r\nMalayan survivals.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          =Hymenophyllaceae.=\r\n\r\nThe frequent use of the generic name _Hymenophyllites_ as a designation\r\nof Palaeozoic ferns, more particularly in the older literature, is\r\nanother instance of the undue importance which palaeobotanists have\r\nalways been prone to attach to external resemblances of vegetative\r\norgans. The fragment of lamina described by Stur for the Culm Measures\r\nof Austria as _Hymenophyllum waldenburgense_[886] has no claim to\r\nconsideration as evidence of Palaeozoic Hymenophyllaceae. On the other\r\nhand, there are a few records of fertile fronds which, though not to\r\nbe accepted without reserve, are worthy of more careful examination.\r\nSome petrified sporangia described by Renault[887] from the Culm of\r\nEsnost are referred to _Hymenophyllites_ on account of the position\r\nof the annulus, which appears to encircle about two-thirds of the\r\ncircumference; it is, however, not certain that the annulus is\r\nhorizontal as in the recent genus.\r\n\r\nThe Culm species _Rhodea patentissima_ described by Ettingshausen[888]\r\nas _Hymenophyllites patentissima_ and subsequently referred by\r\nStur[889] to _Rhodea_, is regarded by these authors as closely allied\r\nto _Hymenophyllum_ simply on the ground of the finely divided and\r\ndelicate sterile fronds; another species, _Rhodea moravica_ (Ett.),\r\nwhich Ettingshausen referred to _Trichomanes_, is compared with\r\nrecent species of that genus. In neither case do we know anything of\r\nsporangial characters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 270.\r\n\r\n  A, E. _Senftenbergia elegans._\r\n  B. _Oligocarpia Brongniartii._\r\n  C. _Trichomanes_ sp.\r\n  D. _Hymenophyllum tunbrigense._\r\n  F, G. _Sphenopteris_ (_Hymenophyllites_) _quadridactylites._\r\n\r\n  (A, B, F, G, after Zeiller; D, after Hooker; E, after Stur.)]\r\n\r\nA fertile sphenopteroid frond figured by Schimper as _Hymenophyllum\r\nWeissi_[890] from the Coal-Measures of Saarbrücken bears some\r\nresemblance to recent Hymenophyllaceae, but the figures are by no means\r\nconvincing: an examination of the type-specimens in the Strassburg\r\nMuseum led Solms-Laubach[891] to express dissent from Schimper’s\r\ndetermination. A more satisfactory example is that afforded by the\r\nfertile pieces of a frond described by Zeiller[892] from French\r\nCoal-Measures as _Hymenophyllites quadridactylites_ (Gutbier). Some\r\nof the ultimate segments with a truncated tip are preserved in close\r\nassociation with a group of oval sporangia with a complete transverse\r\nannulus (fig. 270, F, G). The position of the sporangia is such as to\r\nsuggest their separation from a terminal columnar receptacle like that\r\nin _Trichomanes_ and _Hymenophyllum_. In his account of this species\r\nfrom the Coal-Measures of the Forest of Wyre, Kidston[893] states that\r\nZeiller informed him that he had noticed traces of what appeared to be\r\na columnar receptacle in the French specimens.\r\n\r\nThe records of Hymenophyllaceae from the Mesozoic and Tertiary\r\nformations are not such as need detain us. The facts bearing on\r\nthe geological history of this family are singularly meagre. There\r\nis no evidence which can be adduced in favour of regarding the\r\nHymenophyllaceae as ferns of great antiquity, which played a prominent\r\npart in the floras of the past.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to find that the genus _Ankyropteris_[894], one of\r\nthe Botryopterideae (a group of Palaeozoic Ferns for which I propose\r\nthe name Coenopterideae), has a morphological character in common\r\nwith _Trichomanes_, namely the production of axillary buds: there are\r\nalso features in the stelar anatomy shared by the Botryopterideae and\r\nHymenophyllaceae[895]. These resemblances, though by no means amounting\r\nto proof of near relationship, point to a remote ancestry for certain\r\nfeatures retained by existing members of the Hymenophyllaceae.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =Cyatheaceae.=\r\n\r\nThe specimens from the Culm rocks of Moravia on which Stur founded the\r\nspecies _Thyrsopteris schistorum_[896] are too imperfectly preserved\r\nto warrant the use of this generic name. Goeppert[897] in 1836\r\ninstituted the genera _Cyatheites_, _Hemitelites_, and _Balantites_\r\nfor species of Carboniferous ferns believed to be closely allied to\r\nrecent Cyatheaceae, but a fuller knowledge of these types has clearly\r\ndemonstrated that in all cases the reference to this family had no\r\njustification.\r\n\r\nThe Upper Carboniferous species _Dicksonites Pluckeneti_, of which\r\nSterzel[898] described fertile specimens in 1886 as possessing circular\r\nsori, has since been shown by Grand’Eury[899] to be a Pteridosperm\r\nbearing small seeds. In _Sphenopteris_ (_Discopteris_) _cristata_\r\n(Brongn.) Zeiller[900] has described sori very like those of _Cyathea_\r\nand _Alsophila_, but differing in the exannulate sporangia: this\r\nspecies, like so many of the Palaeozoic ferns, is probably more akin to\r\nthe Marattiaceae than to the Cyatheaceae.\r\n\r\nWe have as yet no satisfactory evidence of the existence of the\r\nCyatheaceae in Palaeozoic floras. It is not until we reach the Jurassic\r\nperiod that trustworthy data are obtained. Raciborski[901] has\r\nidentified as Cyatheaceous fertile Jurassic fronds from Poland, but\r\nhis figures are inconclusive. In _Alsophila polonica_ it is not clear\r\nwhether the annulus is vertical or oblique, and in another supposed\r\nmember of the family, _Gonatosorus Nathorsti_, in which the indusium is\r\ndescribed as bivalvate, there is no proof of affinity to Cyatheaceae.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to decipher the past history of the Cyatheaceae it\r\nis important to remember the close resemblance between the fertile\r\nsegments of some species of _Davallia_ (Polypodiaceae) and those of\r\n_Dicksonia_ (fig. 229, C, D, p. 294). Unless the sporangia are well\r\nenough preserved to show the position of the annulus, it is frequently\r\nimpossible to feel much confidence in the value of the grosser\r\nfeatures, such as the reduced lamina of the fertile segments and the\r\nform of the sori. It is, however, probable that the widely-spread\r\nJurassic species _Coniopteris hymenophylloides_ is correctly referred\r\nto the Cyatheaceae, but even in the case of this species the evidence\r\nof external form needs confirmation by an examination of individual\r\nsporangia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Coniopteris._\r\n\r\nThis genus was instituted by Brongniart[902] for fossil fronds\r\ncharacterised by pinnules more or less intermediate between the\r\n_Pecopteris_ and _Sphenopteris_ type and agreeing in the form of the\r\nsori with the leaves of recent species of _Dicksonia_. It should\r\nbe noted that Stur included in this genus a species, _Coniopteris\r\nlunzensis_[903] from the Upper Trias of Lunz, which he regarded as a\r\nMarattiaceous fern.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coniopteris hymenophylloides_, Brongn.

VIII.\r\n\r\nThe above list represents a small selection of the names applied to\r\nJurassic ferns from different localities which there are good grounds\r\nfor regarding as referable to a single type[904].\r\n\r\n  Frond tripinnate; pinnae linear acuminate, attached to the rachis\r\n  at a wide angle; the pinnules vary considerably in size and\r\n  shape; in some the lamina is divided into a few broad and rounded\r\n  lobes (fig. 275, B) while in others the leaflets are dissected\r\n  into narrow linear segments. The sori are borne at the ends of\r\n  veins; the fertile pinnules have a much reduced lamina and, in\r\n  extreme cases, bear a close resemblance to those of _Thyrsopteris\r\n  elegans_ (fig. 229, A, p. 294). The sori are partially enclosed in\r\n  a cup-like indusium and the sporangia appear to have an oblique\r\n  annulus.\r\n\r\n  Venation and habit of frond of the _Sphenopteris_ type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 271. _Coniopteris hymenophylloides_ (Brongn.).\r\n  Nat. size. From a specimen in the Manchester Museum.]\r\n\r\nThe pinna shown in fig. 271 is the type-specimen of _Sphenopteris\r\narguta_ Lind. and Hutt. from the Yorkshire Inferior Oolite and is\r\nindistinguishable from the English examples on which Brongniart founded\r\nhis species _S. hymenophylloides_. Fig. 272 shows a specimen from\r\nthe York Museum illustrating the difference between the sterile and\r\nfertile pinnae. The resemblance of some fertile pinnae of _Coniopteris\r\nhymenophylloides_ to those of _Thyrsopteris elegans_ has led to a\r\nfrequent use, without any solid justification, of the generic name of\r\nthe Juan Fernandez fern for Jurassic and Wealden plants. It is not\r\nimpossible that some of the fossils described by Heer from Jurassic\r\nrocks of Siberia[905] as species of _Thyrsopteris_ are Cyatheaceous\r\nferns, but it is impossible to say with certainty that they are\r\ngenerically identical with the recent species. In his monograph of the\r\nPotomac flora of Virginia[906] and Maryland, Fontaine has described as\r\nspecies of _Thyrsopteris_ several specimens of fronds which afford\r\nno evidence as to the nature of the sori or sporangia. Some of the\r\nfronds referred by this author to _Thyrsopteris rarinervis_[907],\r\nwhich I examined in the Washington Museum, are in all probability\r\nexamples of _Onychiopsis_, a genus included in the Polypodiaceae. The\r\nfragments described by Lester Ward[908] as species of _Thyrsopteris_\r\nfrom the Lower Cretaceous of the Black Hills of North America afford\r\nno satisfactory evidence of relationship to the recent type. Similarly\r\nVelenovský has described a Lower Cretaceous _Onychiopsis_ from\r\nBohemia[909] as a species of _Thyrsopteris_, although the fertile\r\nsegments bear little or no resemblance to those of the Cyatheaceous\r\ngenus. Some fertile portions of fronds described by Heer[910] as\r\n_Asplenium Johnstrupi_ and afterwards as _Dicksonia Johnstrupi_[911]\r\nfrom the Cretaceous beds (Kome series) of Greenland are very similar to\r\n_Coniopteris hymenophylloides_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 272. _Coniopteris hymenophylloides._ Specimen from\r\n  the Inferior Oolite, Scarborough; in the York Museum. [M.S.]]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coniopteris quinqueloba_ (Phillips). Fig. 273.\r\n\r\nThis species, originally described by Phillips[912] as _Sphenopteris\r\nquinqueloba_, is very similar in habit to _C. hymenophylloides_,\r\ndiffering chiefly in the smaller size of the leaf and in the narrower\r\nultimate segments. The specimen shown in fig. 273, B, illustrates the\r\nform of the sorus and sporangia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 273. _Coniopteris quinqueloba_ (Phillips). A, × 2;\r\n  B, considerably enlarged. From drawings supplied by Dr Nathorst.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coniopteris arguta_ (Lind. and Hutt.[913]). Figs. 274, 275, A.\r\n\r\nThe sterile pinnae of this species bear pinnules of a type met with\r\nin various species of ferns from different horizons; the smaller ones\r\nare entire and slightly falcate, while on the lower part of a frond\r\nthe ultimate segments are longer and have a crenulate margin. The\r\nfertile pinnae bear pinnules reduced to a midrib with a narrow border,\r\nand terminating in a cup-like indusium (fig. 275, A). In habit the\r\nsterile leaf (fig. 274) of this species is similar to the Jurassic\r\nSchizaeaceous fern _Klukia exilis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Protopteris._\r\n\r\nPresl[914] instituted this genus for a Lower Cretaceous tree-fern\r\nfrom Bohemia originally figured as _Lepidodendron punctatum_[915]\r\nand assigned to a Palaeozoic horizon; it was afterwards named by\r\nCorda[916] _Protopteris Sternbergii_ and referred by Brongniart[917]\r\nto _Sigillaria_. The genus _Protopteris_ stands for fossil fern-stems\r\nwith the habit and, in the main, the structural features of recent\r\ntree-ferns. Persistent leaf-bases and sinuous adventitious roots\r\ncover the surface of the stems: the vascular system is of the\r\ndictyostelic type characteristic of _Cyathea_ (fig. 240, p. 313) and\r\n_Alsophila_. It is by the pattern formed by the vascular tissue on the\r\nexposed surface of the leaf-bases that _Protopteris_ is most readily\r\nrecognised: the leaf-trace has a horse-shoe form with the ends curled\r\ninwards and the sides more or less indented (fig. 277). The generic\r\nname _Caulopteris_ is used by some authors in preference to Presl’s\r\ngenus; but _Protopteris_ is more conveniently restricted to Mesozoic\r\nCyatheaceous stems and _Caulopteris_ to Palaeozoic stems, with the\r\ninternal structure of _Psaronius_ (see Chap. XXIII.). Stenzel applies\r\n_Caulopteris_ to Mesozoic stems in which the leaf-trace consists of\r\nseveral separate strands and not of a continuous band.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 274. _Coniopteris arguta._ (Nat. size.

Fig. 277.\r\n\r\nThe earliest information in regard to the anatomy of this widely\r\nspread Lower Cretaceous fern we owe to Corda, who showed that the\r\nspecies agrees in essentials with existing tree-ferns. The English\r\nexample described by Carruthers[920] from Upper Greensand beds in\r\nDorsetshire (now in the British Museum) shows only the external\r\nfeatures. The sandstone cast (14 cm. in diameter), of which a\r\nportion is seen in fig. 277, was described by Heer from Disco Island\r\n(Greenland) as a Carboniferous species[921], but afterwards correctly\r\nassigned to the Cenomanian series[922] This species is recorded\r\nalso from the Lower Cretaceous of Bohemia by Frič and Bayer[923]\r\nAmong examples of petrified stems exhibiting a general agreement\r\nwith _Protopteris punctata_ are those described by Stenzel[924] from\r\nTuronian rocks in Germany. In one of these, _Rhizodendron oppoliense_\r\nGöpp., attention is drawn to branches given off from the stem stele\r\nwhich have a solenostelic structure in contrast to the dictyostele of\r\nthe stem; also to the minute structure of the tracheae which appear to\r\nhave their ends perforated, a feature shown by Gwynne-Vaughan[925] to\r\nbe characteristic of the xylem elements of many ferns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 278.\r\n\r\n  A. _Laccopteris polypodioides_, Brongn.

The section of the stem (fig. H) shows the\r\nnarrow vascular bands, x, of a dictyostele similar to that of recent\r\nCyatheaceous tree-ferns and a form of meristele (fig. G, x) resembling\r\nthat of _P. punctata_. Adventitious roots are seen in section at R\r\n(figs. G and H).\r\n\r\n\r\n                           =Polypodiaceae.=\r\n\r\nSections of petrified sporangia from the English Coal-Measures\r\n(_Pteridotheca_ sp.) occasionally exhibit a striking resemblance to\r\nthose of recent Polypodiaceae[927], but in the absence of material\r\nin which it is possible to recognise the true orientation of the\r\nsporangia, the exact position of the annulus is almost impossible to\r\ndetermine. We have as yet no satisfactory evidence of the existence of\r\ntrue Polypodiaceae in the Palaeozoic era. It is noteworthy that apart\r\nfrom the absence of ferns which can reasonably be included in this\r\nfamily, the anatomical features of the Botryopterideae (Coenopterideae)\r\nand of the Cycadofilices or Pteridosperms do not foreshadow those\r\nof Polypodiaceous ferns. On the other hand, as we have already\r\nnoticed, anatomical characters of such families as the Gleicheniaceae,\r\nHymenophyllaceae, and Schizaeaceae are met with in certain generalised\r\nPalaeozoic types. These facts are perhaps of some importance as\r\nsupplying collateral evidence in favour of the relatively more recent\r\norigin of the dominant family of ferns in modern floras.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 279.\r\n  A. _Adiantides antiques_ (Ett.). (½ nat. size.)\r\n  B. _A. Lindsayoides_ (Sew.). (B′ nat. size.)\r\n\r\n  (A, after Kidston.)]\r\n\r\nThe use of the generic name _Adiantites_ for fern-like fronds of\r\nLower Carboniferous age characterised by cuneate pinnules like\r\nthose of species of _Adiantum_, suggests an affinity which is in\r\nall probability non-existent. It has been pointed out that this\r\ngeneric name was applied in the first instance to the leaves of\r\nthe Jurassic plant _Ginkgo digitata_[928] and should, therefore,\r\nbe discarded. Schimper[929] used the designation _Adiantides_, and\r\nEttingshausen[930], more rashly than wisely, preferred _Adiantum_. The\r\nspecimens described by Kidston[931] as _Adiantides antiquus_ (Ett.)\r\n(fig. 279, A) from the Carboniferous limestone of Flintshire are\r\nportions of tripinnate fronds bearing cuneate segments with numerous\r\nforked veins radiating from the contracted base of the lamina. It is\r\nnot improbable, in view of Dr White’s[932] discovery of seeds on a very\r\nsimilar plant from the Pottsville beds of North America, that this\r\ncharacteristic Lower Carboniferous genus is a Pteridosperm.\r\n\r\nFrom Jurassic rocks in various parts of the world numerous fossils\r\nhave been described under the generic names _Aspidium_, _Asplenium_,\r\n_Davallia_, _Polypodium_, and _Pteris_. In the great majority of\r\ncases such records leave much to be desired from the point of view of\r\nstudents who appreciate the dangers of relying on external similarity\r\nbetween vegetative organs, and on resemblances founded on obscure\r\nimpressions of sori. The generic term _Woodwardites_[933], which\r\nsuggests affinity with the recent genus _Woodwardia_, has been used for\r\nRhaetic plants belonging to the Dipteridinae.\r\n\r\nA plant described as _Adiantides Lindsayoides_ from Jurassic rocks\r\nof Victoria[934], characterised by marginal sori which appear to\r\nbe protected by the folded-over edge of the leaflets, and by the\r\nresemblance of the pinnules to those of recent species of _Lindsaya_,\r\nmay be a true Polypodiaceous fern; but in this case, as in many similar\r\ninstances, nothing is known of the structure of the sporangia. Some\r\nsterile pinnae described by Yabe from Jurassic rocks of Korea as\r\n_Adiantites Sewardi_[935] may perhaps be identical with the Australian\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nIn such a species as _Polypodium oregonense_ Font., from Jurassic rocks\r\nof Oregon, the generic name is chosen because the “fructification seems\r\nnear enough to that of _Polypodium_ to justify the placing of the plant\r\nin that genus[936].” But the fact that no sporangia have been found is\r\na fatal objection to this identification.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Onychiopsis._\r\n\r\nThis generic name was instituted by Yokoyama[937] for a Japanese\r\nWealden species, previously described by Geyler[938] as _Thyrsopteris\r\nelongata_, on the ground that, in addition to a similarity in habit of\r\nthe sterile fronds, the fertile pinnae present a close agreement to\r\nthose of the recent genus _Onychium_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Onychiopsis Mantelli_[939] (Brongn.). Figs. 278, D; 280, A and B.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese species _Onychiopsis elongata_ may perhaps be identical\r\nwith this common Wealden fern which, as Fontaine points out, should\r\nbe called _O. psilotoides_ if the rule of priority is to be observed\r\nirrespective of long usage.\r\n\r\n  1824. _Hymenopteris psilotoides_, Stokes and Webb, Trans.

Vol.\r\n        LVII. p. 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Onychiopsis Mantelli_ may be defined as follows:—\r\n\r\n  Frond bipinnate, ovate lanceolate, rachis winged; pinnae\r\n  approximate, given off at an acute angle; pinnules narrow,\r\n  acuminate, with a single vein; the larger segments serrate and\r\n  gradually passing into pinnae with narrow ultimate segments.\r\n  Fertile segments sessile or shortly stalked, linear ovate,\r\n  sometimes terminating in a short awn-like prolongation.\r\n\r\nThe fertile segments (fig. 278, D) bear so close a resemblance to those\r\nof species of _Onychium_ that it would seem justifiable to regard the\r\nplant as a member of the Polypodiaceae. This fern is one of the most\r\ncharacteristic members of the Wealden floras; it occurs in abundance\r\nin the English Wealden, in Portugal, Germany, Belgium, Japan, Bohemia,\r\nSouth Africa, and elsewhere. A piece of rhizome figured from the\r\nEnglish Wealden[940] is very similar to the creeping rhizomes of recent\r\nspecies of Polypodiaceae. The English Wealden specimens shown in fig.\r\n280, A and B, illustrate the difference in form presented by leaves\r\nof this species; the smaller pinnae reproduced in fig. A are more\r\ncharacteristic of the species than are those of the slightly enlarged\r\nexample represented in fig. 280, B.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 280. _Onychiopsis Mantelli._ (From Wealden\r\n  specimens in the British Museum; No. 13495 and No. V. 2615. A,\r\n  natural size; B, very slightly enlarged.)]\r\n\r\nAmong British Tertiary species referred to Polypodiaceae, it is\r\ninteresting to find what may well be an authentic record of a\r\nfern closely allied to the recent tropical species _Acrostichum_\r\n(_Chrysodium_) _aureum_. This Eocene species from Bournemouth is\r\ndescribed as _Chrysodium lanzaeanum_[941]. The frond is simply pinnate\r\nand apparently coriaceous in texture, with lanceolate or oblong\r\nlanceolate pinnules (fig. 261, A, A′, p. 350), differing from those of\r\n_Acrostichum aureum_ in being sessile. A prominent midrib gives off\r\nnumerous anastomosing veins. No fertile pinnules have been found.\r\n\r\nSpecimens described by Forbes from the Eocene beds of the Island of\r\nMull as _Onoclea hebraidica_[942] bear a strong likeness to the North\r\nAmerican and Japanese recent species _Onoclea sensibilis_. Fertile\r\nspecimens referred to the latter species are recorded by Knowlton[943]\r\nfrom Tertiary beds of Montana.\r\n\r\nA species described by Saporta[944] from the Eocene of Sézanne as\r\n_Adiantum apalophyllum_ is recorded by Gardner and Ettingshausen from\r\nBournemouth; an identification which is based on somewhat meagre\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nThe following remarks by Gardner and Ettingshausen are worthy of\r\nrepetition as calling attention to circumstances often overlooked in\r\nanalyses of fossil floras. They speak of ferns as relatively rare\r\nin British Eocene rocks and add,—“the floras consist principally of\r\ndeciduous dicotyledonous leaves, which ... fell into the water and\r\nwere tranquilly silted over. Ferns, on the other hand, would require\r\nsome violence to remove them from the place of their growth, and their\r\npreservation would consequently be exceptional, and they would be\r\nmutilated and fragmentary. This may account for their rarity. Few as\r\nthe British ferns are in the number of species, they nevertheless form\r\nthe largest and most important series of Eocene ferns, even of Tertiary\r\nferns, yet described from one group of beds[945].”\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =Dipteridinae.=\r\n\r\n                           _Dictyophyllum._\r\n\r\nThis genus was founded by Lindley and Hutton for a pinnatifid leaf\r\nfrom the Jurassic rocks of Yorkshire which they regarded as probably\r\ndicotyledonous and named _D. rugosum_[946]. Several ferns of this genus\r\nhave since been found with well-preserved sori which demonstrate a\r\nclose similarity to the recent fern _Dipteris._ _Dictyophyllum_ may be\r\ndefined as follows:—\r\n\r\nFronds large and palmate, characterised by the equal dichotomy of the\r\nmain rachis into two arms which curve outwards and then bend inwards\r\n(fig. 281); from the surface of each arm are given off numerous\r\nspreading pinnae with a lamina more or less deeply dissected into\r\nlobes varying in breadth and in the form of the apex. Each lobe has a\r\nmedian vein, from which branches are given off approximately at right\r\nangles and then subdivide into a reticulum, in the meshes of which the\r\nveinlets end blindly (fig. 282, A and E). Sori composed of annulate\r\nsporangia are crowded on the lower surface of the lamina. In habit\r\nand in sporangial characters the genus closely resembles _Dipteris_,\r\nand in the branching of the frond suggests comparison with _Matonia_.\r\nThe rhizome (_Rhizomopteris_) is creeping and dichotomously branched,\r\nbearing leaf-scars with a horse-shoe form of vascular strand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 281. _Dictyophyllum exile._ (After Nathorst; much\r\n  reduced.)]\r\n\r\n_Dictyophyllum_ is represented by several types to which various\r\nspecific names have been assigned, the distinguishing features being\r\nthe form of the pinna lobes, the degree of concrescence between the\r\nbasal portions of the pinnae, and similar features which in some cases\r\ncan only be safely used as criteria when large specimens are available\r\nfor comparison.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dictyophyllum exile_ (Brauns).

XI. fig. 1.\r\n\r\nThe restoration, after Nathorst[947], shown in fig. 281 illustrates the\r\nhabit of this striking fern, examples of which or of closely allied\r\nspecies are recorded from Rhaetic rocks of Germany, Scania, Persia,\r\nBornholm, Tonkin, China, and elsewhere[948]. The petiole, reaching\r\na length of 60 cm., forks at the apex into two equal arms leaving\r\nbetween them an oval space and occasionally crossing one another. The\r\naxes of these branches are twisted so that the pinnae, which may be\r\nas many as 24 on each arm, and arise from the inner side, by torsion\r\nof the axes assume an external position. An interesting analogy as\r\nregards the twisted rachis of _Dictyophyllum exile_ and _Camptopteris_\r\nis afforded by the leaves of the Cycads, _Macrozamia Fawcettiae_ and\r\n_M. corallipes_, which are also characterised by the torsion of the\r\nrachis. The habit, justly compared by Nathorst with that of _Matonia\r\npectinata_, affords another illustration of the common occurrence\r\nin older ferns of a dichotomous system of branching. The pinnae,\r\ncharacterised by circinate vernation, reach a length of 60 cm. and are\r\ndivided into linear lobes inclined obliquely or at right angles to the\r\npinna axis. The whole of the under surface of the lamina may be covered\r\nwith sporangia, 4–7 sporangia in each sorus; the annulus is incomplete\r\nand approximately vertical (fig. 282, D). The rhizome is probably\r\nrepresented by the dichotomously branched axis described by Nathorst\r\nfrom Scania as _Rhizomopteris major_; the leaf-scars show a horse-shoe\r\nleaf-trace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 282.\r\n\r\n  A. _Dictyophyllum Nilssoni._\r\n  B. _Rhizomopteris Schenki._\r\n  C. _Camptopteris spiralis._\r\n  D, E. _Dictyophyllum exile._\r\n\r\n  (After Nathorst; A, B, C, E, ⅔ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dictyophyllum Nathorsti_ Zeiller[949].\r\n\r\nThis type, represented by a splendid series of specimens from\r\nthe Rhaetic beds of Tonkin, agrees very closely with _D. exile_.\r\nIt differs, however, in the basal parts of the pinnae which are\r\nconcrescent for a length of 5 to 8 cm. instead of free as in _D.\r\nexile_; and, to a slight degree, in the form of the ultimate segments.\r\nIn habit and in soral characters the two species are practically\r\nidentical. Each sorus contains 5 to 8 sporangia, which are rather\r\nlarger than those of _Dipteris_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dictyophyllum rugosum_, Lind. and Hutt.

The leaves of the Jurassic species appear\r\nto have been smaller and more like those of _Dipteris conjugata_ (fig.\r\n231); there are no indications of the existence of the two curved\r\narms at the summit of the petiole which form so striking a feature\r\nin _D. exile_ and _D. Nathorsti_. No sporangia have been found on\r\nEnglish specimens, but it is safe to assume their agreement with those\r\nof other species. A more complete list of records of _D. rugosum_ is\r\ngiven in the first volume of the British Museum Catalogue of Jurassic\r\nplants[950].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 283. _Dictyophyllum rugosum_ (Lind. and Hutt.).\r\n  (Brit. Mus. Nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nNathorst[951] has recently drawn attention to certain differences\r\nbetween _Dictyophyllum_ and _Dipteris_. The pinnate division of the\r\npinnae is not represented in the fronds of the recent species, but this\r\nmethod of lobing, which is a marked characteristic of _Dictyophyllum_,\r\nis less prominent in _Clathropteris_; and in _Camptopteris lunzensis_\r\nStur[952], an Austrian Upper Triassic species, the pinnae are entire.\r\nIn _Dictyophyllum_ the sori cover the whole lower surface of the leaf;\r\nin _Dipteris_ they are more widely separated and the sporangia have a\r\ndiameter of 0·02 mm., but in _Dictyophyllum_ the diameter is 0·4–0·6\r\nmm. Moreover in _Dictyophyllum_ the sori contain 5 to 8 sporangia,\r\nwhereas in _Dipteris_ they are much more numerous. Despite these\r\ndifferences it is clear, as Nathorst says, that _Dictyophyllum_,\r\n_Clathropteris_, and _Camptopteris_ are existing types very closely\r\nallied to _Dipteris_. It is a matter of secondary importance whether\r\nwe include all in the Dipteridinae or follow Nathorst’s suggestion and\r\nrefer the fossil genera to the separate family Camptopteridinae.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Thaumatopteris._\r\n\r\nThis genus, founded by Goeppert[953] for a Rhaetic plant from Bayreuth,\r\nis by some authors[954] regarded as identical with _Dictyophyllum_,\r\nbut it has recently been resuscitated by Nathorst[955] for specimens\r\nwhich he names _T. Schenki_, formerly included by Schenk in his species\r\n_T. Brauniana_[956]. It bears a close resemblance, in the long linear\r\npinnules with an entire or crenulate margin, to _Dictyophyllum Fuchsi_\r\ndescribed by Zeiller[957] from Tonkin, and it would seem hardly\r\nnecessary to adopt a distinctive generic designation. The sporangia\r\nhave a vertical or slightly oblique annulus and the rhizome is similar\r\nto that of _Dictyophyllum exile_. The habit of the genus is shown in\r\nfig. 284, which represents one of the German Rhaetic species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 284. _Thaumatopteris Münsteri._ (From a specimen in\r\n  the Bergakademie, Berlin; ⅓ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Clathropteris._\r\n\r\n_Clathropteris meniscoides_, Brongn. Fig. 285.\r\n\r\n_Clathropteris_, founded by Brongniart[958] for Rhaetic specimens from\r\nScania, agrees very closely with some species of _Dictyophyllum_,\r\nbut in view of the more rectangular form of the venation-meshes it\r\nis convenient to retain both names. The type-species was originally\r\nnamed _Filicites meniscoides_[959] and afterwards transferred to\r\n_Clathropteris_. An examination of Brongniart’s specimens has\r\nconvinced Nathorst of the specific identity of _C. meniscoides_ and _C.\r\nplatyphylla_. The Tonkin leaves described by Zeiller[960] under the\r\nlatter name should, therefore, be included in _C. meniscoides_, which\r\nmay be thus defined:\r\n\r\n  The petiolate frond is characterised by an equal dichotomy of\r\n  the rachis, as in _Dictyophyllum_; each branch bore 5–15 pinnae,\r\n  disposed _en éventail_, reaching a length of 20–30 cm. and fused\r\n  basally as in _D. Nathorsti_ Zeill. Pinnae linear lanceolate,\r\n  slightly contracted at the lower end and gradually tapered\r\n  distally. The lamina, 3–14 cm. broad, is characterised by obtusely\r\n  pointed marginal lobes. From the midrib of each pinna lateral\r\n  veins are given off at a wide angle, and adjacent veins are\r\n  connected by a series of branches which divide the lamina into a\r\n  regular reticulum of rectangular and polygonal meshes (fig. 285).\r\n  The sori are abundant and contain 5–12 sporangia like those of\r\n  _Dictyophyllum_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 285. _Clathropteris meniscoides._ From Rhaetic\r\n  rocks near Erlangen. [M.S.]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 286. _Clathropteris egyptiaca._ (Nat. size.) _a_,\r\n  _b_, pieces of main ribs in grooves.]\r\n\r\nWhat is probably the rhizome of this species has been described\r\nby Nathorst (_Rhizomopteris cruciata_); it is similar to that of\r\n_Dictyophyllum_, but the leaf-scars are more widely separated. This\r\nspecies occurs in Upper Triassic, Rhaetic or Lower Jurassic rocks of\r\nScania, France, Germany, Switzerland, Bornholm, North America, China,\r\nTonkin, and Persia and is represented by fragments in the Rhaetic beds\r\nof Bristol[961].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clathropteris egyptiaca_ Sew.[962] Fig. 286.\r\n\r\nThe specimen on which this species was founded was discovered in the\r\nNubian Sandstone east of Edfu; the age of the beds is uncertain, but\r\nthe presence of _Clathropteris_ suggests a Lower Jurassic or Rhaetic\r\nhorizon[963]. Seven strong ribs radiate through the lamina from the\r\nsummit of the petiole; at _a_ and _b_ small pieces of the projecting\r\nribs are shown in the grooves. From the main veins slender branches are\r\ngiven off at right angles and, as seen in the enlarged drawing, these\r\nagain subdivide into a delicate reticulum with free-ending veinlets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 287. _Camptopteris spiralis._ (After Nathorst. Much\r\n  reduced.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Camptopteris._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Camptopteris spiralis_, Nath. Figs. 282, C; 287.\r\n\r\nNathorst proposed this generic name for Rhaetic fronds[964] resembling\r\nthose of _Clathropteris_ and _Dictyophyllum_, but differing in the\r\nform of the pinnae and in habit. The habit of the type-species, _C.\r\nspiralis_, is shown in fig. 287. An examination of the specimens in\r\nthe Stockholm Museum convinced me of the correctness of Nathorst’s\r\nrestoration[965]. Each of the forked arms of the rachis bore as many\r\nas 150–160 long and narrow pinnae characterised by an anastomosing\r\nvenation (fig. 282, C) and by a spiral disposition due to the\r\ntorsion of the axes. The sporangia agree in essentials with those of\r\n_Dictyophyllum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Hausmannia._\r\n\r\nA critical and exhaustive account of this genus has been given by Prof.\r\nVon Richter[966] based on an examination of specimens found in the\r\nLower Cretaceous rocks of Quedlinburg in Germany. The name was proposed\r\nby Dunker[967] for leaves from the Wealden of Germany characterised by\r\na deeply dissected dichotomously branched lamina. Andrae subsequently\r\ninstituted the genus _Protorhipis_[968] for suborbicular leaves with\r\ndichotomously branched ribs from the Lias of Steierdorf. A similar\r\nbut smaller type of leaf was afterwards described by Zigno[969]\r\nfrom Jurassic beds of Italy as _P. asarifolius_, and Nathorst[970]\r\nfigured a closely allied form from Rhaetic rocks of Sweden. While\r\nsome authors regarded _Hausmannia_ and _Protorhipis_ as ferns, others\r\ncompared them with the leaves of _Baiera_ (Ginkgoales); Saporta\r\nsuggested a dicotyledonous affinity for leaves of the _Protorhipis_\r\ntype. The true nature of the fossils was recognised by Zeiller[971],\r\nwho called attention to the very close resemblance in habit and in\r\nsoral characters to the recent genus _Dipteris_. A comparison of the\r\ndifferent species of _Dipteris_, including young leaves (fig. 231,\r\np. 297), with those of the fossil species reveals a very striking\r\nagreement[972]. There can be no doubt, as Richter points out, that the\r\nnames _Hausmannia_ and _Protorhipis_ stand for one generic type.\r\n\r\n_Hausmannia_ may be defined as follows:\r\n\r\n  Rhizome creeping, slender, dichotomously branched; leaf-stalks\r\n  slender (2–25 cm. long), bearing a leathery lamina (1–12 cm. long\r\n  and broad), wedge-shaped below, occasionally cordate or reniform,\r\n  entire or more or less deeply lobed into broad linear segments.\r\n  The leaf is characterised by dichotomously branched main ribs\r\n  which arise from the summit of the rachis as two divergent arms\r\n  and radiate in a palmate manner, with repeated forking, through\r\n  the lamina. Lateral veins are given off at a wide angle, and, by\r\n  subdivision, form a fairly regular network similar to that in\r\n  _Dictyophyllum_, _Clathropteris_, and _Dipteris_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 288. _Hausmannia dichotoma._ (Specimens from\r\n  the late Dr Marcus Gunn’s Collection of Upper Jurassic plants,\r\n  Sutherlandshire; very slightly reduced.)]\r\n\r\n_Hausmannia dichotoma_, Dunker[973]. Fig. 288, A, B.\r\n\r\nThis Wealden species, represented in the North German flora and in\r\nbeds of approximately the same age at Quedlinburg, has been discovered\r\nby Dr Marcus Gunn in Upper Jurassic rocks on the north-east coast of\r\nScotland. The lamina (12 cm. or more in length) is divided into five\r\nto seven linear segments and bears a close superficial resemblance\r\nto leaves of _Baiera_ and to recent species of _Schizaea_ (fig. 222,\r\np. 287). Each segment contains one or two main ribs (fig. 288, A). A\r\nsimilar form is described by Bartholin[974] and by Moeller[975] as _H.\r\nForchammeri_ from Jurassic rocks of Bornholm.\r\n\r\n_Hausmannia Kohlmanni_, Richt. Fig. 278, F.\r\n\r\nIn this species, instituted by Richter from material obtained from the\r\nLower Cretaceous beds of Strohberg[976], the comparatively slender\r\nrhizome bears fronds with petioles reaching a length in extreme cases\r\nof 25 cm. but usually of about 10 cm. The lamina (1–7 cm. long and\r\n1–10 cm. broad) is described as leathery, obcordate, and divided into\r\ntwo symmetrical halves by a median sinus which, though occasionally\r\nextending more than half-way through the lamina, is usually shallow.\r\nThe venation consists of two main branches which diverge from the\r\nsummit of the petiole (fig. 278, F) and subdivide into dichotomously\r\nbranched ribs; finer veins (not shown in the drawing) are given off\r\nfrom these at right angles and form more or less rectangular meshes\r\nas in other members of the Dipteridinae and in such recent ferns as\r\n_Polypodium quercifolium_ (fig. 231, D, p. 297).\r\n\r\nThe imperfect lamina represented in fig. 289 may belong to _Hausmannia\r\nRichteri_ or may be a distinct species; it shows some of the finer\r\nveins connecting the shorter forked ribs, which formed part of the\r\nreticulate ramifying system in the mesophyll. This specimen was\r\nobtained from the plant-beds of Culgower on the Sutherlandshire coast,\r\nwhich have been placed by some geologists in the Kimmeridgian series.\r\n\r\nThe smaller type represented in fig. 278, E, is referred by Richter\r\nto a distinct species, _Hausmannia Sewardi_[977], founded on a few\r\nspecimens from the Lower Cretaceous strata of Strohberg. This species\r\nis characterised by a stouter rhizome bearing smaller leaves consisting\r\nof a short petiole (3–4 cm. long) and an obovate lamina (1–2 cm. long\r\nand broad). There are usually two opposite leaflets on each leaf-stalk,\r\nand these may be equivalent to the two halves of a single deeply\r\ndissected lamina.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 289. _Hausmannia sp._ Upper Jurassic, near\r\n  Helmsdale, Scotland. From a specimen in the British Museum. (Nat.\r\n  size.)]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare these different forms of _Hausmannia_ with\r\nthe fronds of recent species of _Dipteris_ represented in fig. 231. The\r\nmore deeply dissected type, such as _H. dichotoma_, closely resembles\r\n_D. Lobbiana_ or _D. quinquefurcata_, while the more or less entire\r\nfossil leaves (fig. 278, E, F and fig. 289) are very like the somewhat\r\nunusual form of _Dipteris conjugata_ shown in fig. 231, B, p. 297.\r\n\r\nOther species of the genus are recorded from Liassic rocks of\r\nSteierdorf[978] (Hungary) and of Bornholm[979]. Nathorst[980] has\r\ndescribed a small Rhaetic species from Scania: a French Permian plant\r\ndescribed by Zeiller[981] and compared by him with _H. dichotoma_, may\r\nbe a Palaeozoic example of this Dipteris-like genus.\r\n\r\nSome segments of leaves from the Eocene beds (Middle Bagshot) of\r\nBournemouth, and now in the British Museum, described by Gardner\r\nand Ettingshausen[982] as _Podoloma polypodioides_, bear a close\r\nresemblance in the venation to the lamina of _Dipteris conjugata_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n                         Marattiales (Fossil).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe discovery of Pteridosperms has necessarily led to a considerable\r\nmodification of the views formerly held that existing genera of\r\nMarattiaceae represent survivors of a group which occupied a dominant\r\nposition in the forests of the Coal age. Mr Arber writes:—“The\r\nevidence, formerly regarded as beyond suspicion, that the eusporangiate\r\nferns formed a dominant feature of the vegetation of the Palaeozoic\r\nperiod, has been undermined, more especially by the remarkable\r\ndiscovery of the male organs of _Lyginodendron_ by Mr Kidston. At best\r\nwe can only now regard them as a subsidiary group in that epoch in the\r\npast history of the vegetable kingdom[983].” Dr Scott expresses himself\r\nin terms slightly more favourable to the view that the Marattiaceae\r\nrepresent the aristocracy among the Filicales. He says:—“We now have to\r\nseek laboriously for evidence, which formerly seemed to lie open to us\r\non all hands. I believe, however, that such careful investigation will\r\nresult in the resuscitation of the Palaeozoic ferns as a considerable,\r\nthough not as a dominant group[984].” Zeiller’s faith[985] in the\r\nprospect of Marattiaceous ferns retaining their position as prominent\r\nmembers of Palaeozoic floras, though shaken, is not extinguished: he\r\nrecognises that they played a subordinate part.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the impossibility of determining\r\nwhether Palaeozoic fern-like fronds may be legitimately retained in\r\nthe Filicales, or whether they must be removed into the ever widening\r\nterritory of the Pteridosperms. The difficulty is that the evidence\r\nof reproductive organs is very far from decisive. In the absence of\r\nthe female reproductive organs, the seeds, we cannot in most cases be\r\ncertain whether the small sporangium-like bodies on fertile pinnules\r\nare true fern sporangia or the microsporangia of a heterosporous\r\npteridosperm. What is usually called an exannulate fern sporangium,\r\nsuch as we have in _Angiopteris_ and in many Palaeozoic plants, has\r\nno distinguishing features which can be used as a decisive test. The\r\nmicrosporophylls of the Mesozoic Bennettitales produced their spores\r\nin sporangial compartments grouped in synangia like those of recent\r\nMarattiaceae; and in the case of _Crossotheca_, a type of frond always\r\nregarded as Marattiaceous until Kidston[986] proved it to be the\r\nmicrosporophyll of _Lyginodendron_, we have a striking instance of the\r\nfutility of making dogmatic assertions as to the filicinean nature of\r\nwhat look like true fern sporangia. In all probability Dr Kidston’s\r\nsurmise that the supposed fern sporangia known as _Dactylotheca_,\r\n_Renaultia_, _Urnatopteris_ are the microsporangia of Pteridosperms\r\nwill be proved correct[987]. The question is how many of the supposed\r\nMarattiaceous sporangia must be assigned to Pteridosperms? There is,\r\nhowever, no reasonable doubt that true Marattiaceae formed a part\r\nof the Upper Carboniferous flora. All that can be attempted in the\r\nfollowing pages is to describe briefly some of the numerous types of\r\nsporangia recognised on Palaeozoic fern-like foliage, leaving to the\r\nfuture the task of deciding how many of them can be accepted as those\r\nof ferns. It is impossible to avoid overlapping and some repetition\r\nin the sections dealing with true Ferns and with Pteridosperms. The\r\nfilicinean nature of the stem known as _Psaronius_ (see page 415) has\r\nnot as yet been questioned.\r\n\r\nThe nomenclature of supposed Marattiaceous species from Carboniferous\r\nand Permian rocks is in a state of some confusion owing to a lack of\r\nsatisfactory distinguishing features between certain types to which\r\ndifferent generic names have been assigned. As we have already seen in\r\nthe case of supposed leptosporangiate sporangia, the interpretation\r\nof structural features in petrified or carbonised sporangia does not\r\nafford an example of unanimity among palaeobotanical experts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Ptychocarpus._\r\n\r\nThis generic name, proposed by the late Professor Weiss[988],\r\nis applied to a type of fructification illustrated by the plant\r\nwhich Brongniart named _Pecopteris unita_, a species common in the\r\nUpper Coal-Measures of England[989]. It is adopted by Kidston for\r\nfertile specimens from Radstock which he describes as _Ptychocarpus\r\noblongus_[990], but the precise nature of the fertile pinnules of this\r\nspecies cannot be determined.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ptychocarpus unita_ (Brongn.[991]). Fig. 291, A, B. (= _Goniopteris\r\nunita_, Grand’Eury.)\r\n\r\nThis species has tripinnate fronds with linear pinnae bearing\r\ncontiguous pinnules of the _Pecopteris_ type (fig. 291, B), 4–5 mm.\r\nlong, confluent at the base or for the greater part of their length.\r\nOn the under surface of the fertile segments, which are identical\r\nwith the sterile, occur circular synangia (fig. 291, A) consisting\r\nof seven sporangia embedded in a common parenchymatous tissue and\r\nradially disposed round a receptacle supplied with vascular tissue.\r\nThe synangium is described as shortly stalked like those of _Marattia\r\nKaulfussii_ (fig. 245, B′, p. 320). In shape, in the complete union of\r\nthe sporangia, and presumably in the apical dehiscence, _Ptychocarpus_\r\nagrees very closely with _Kaulfussia_ (fig. 245); but we cannot be\r\ncertain that we have not a collection of microsporangia simulating a\r\nfern synangium.\r\n\r\nA synangium closely resembling _Ptychocarpus_ has been described\r\nby Mr Watson[992] from the Lower Coal-Measures of Lancashire as\r\n_Cyathotrachus altus_, but there is no convincing evidence as to the\r\nnature of the plant on which it was borne.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Danaeites._\r\n\r\nThis generic name, instituted by Goeppert[993], has been used by\r\nauthors without due regard to the nature of the evidence of affinity to\r\n_Danaea_. The type named by Stur _Danaeites sarepontanus_[994] (fig.\r\n291, E) bears small pecopteroid pinnules with ovoid sporangia in groups\r\nof 8–16 in two contiguous series on the lower face of the lamina. The\r\nsporangia dehisce by an apical pore and are more or less embedded in\r\nthe mesophyll of the segments. No figures have been published showing\r\nany detailed sporangial structure, and such evidence as we have is\r\ninsufficient to warrant the conclusion that the resemblance to _Danaea_\r\nis more than an analogy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Parapecopteris._\r\n\r\n_Parapecopteris neuropteroides_, Grand’Eury. Fig. 290, D.\r\n\r\nThe plant described by Grand’Eury[995] from the Coal-fields of Gard\r\nand St Étienne, and made the type of a new genus, is characterised\r\nby pinnules intermediate between those of _Pecopteris_ and\r\n_Neuropteris_[996] and by the presence of two rows of united sporangia\r\nalong the lateral veins, as in _Danaea_ and _Danaeites_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Asterotheca._\r\n\r\nCertain species of _Pecopteris_ fronds from Carboniferous strata\r\nare characterised by circular sori or synangia consisting of a\r\nsmall number (3–8) of exannulate sporangia attached to a central\r\nreceptacle and free only at their apices. Strasburger[997] suggested\r\na Marattiaceous affinity for _Asterotheca_ and Stur[998] describes\r\nthe species _Asterotheca Sternbergii_ Goepp. (fig. 291, C, D) as an\r\nexample of a Marattiaceous fern. The latter author retains Corda’s\r\ngenus _Hawlea_[999] for the fertile fronds of the common Coal-Measures\r\nspecies _Pecopteris Miltoni_, while on the other hand Kidston[1000]\r\nincludes this type in _Asterotheca_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pecopteris_ (_Asterotheca_) _Miltoni_ (Artis).\r\n\r\n  1825. _Filicites Miltoni_, Artis, Antedil.

They are characterised by the presence of\r\naphlebiae[1001] appressed to the rachis and by circular sori composed\r\nof a small number (3–6) of sporangia. In habit and in the form of the\r\npinnules this type is similar to _Dactylotheca plumosa_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 291.\r\n\r\n  A, B. _Ptychocarpus unita._\r\n  C, D. _Asterotheca Sternbergii._\r\n  E. _Danaeites sarepontanus._\r\n  F. _Hawlea Miltoni._\r\n  G.  _Hawlea pulcherrima._\r\n  H–K. _Scolecopteris elegans._\r\n\r\n  (A, B, after Renault; C–G, after Stur; H, I, after Strasburger; K,\r\n  after Sterzel.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Hawlea._\r\n\r\nStur[1002] retains this generic name for sori in which the sporangia\r\nare free and united only by the proximal end to a central receptacle\r\n(fig. 291, F, G). He describes the individual sporangia as possessing\r\na rudimentary annulus, a comparatively strong wall, and terminating\r\nin a pointed distal end. He emphasises the greater degree of cohesion\r\nbetween the sporangia of _Asterotheca_ as the distinguishing feature\r\nof that genus; but this is a character difficult to recognise in some\r\ncases, and from the analogy of recent ferns one is disposed to attach\r\nlittle importance to the greater or less extent to which sporangia are\r\nunited, at least in such cases as _Asterotheca_ and _Hawlea_ when the\r\ncohesion is never complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Scolecopteris._\r\n\r\nZenker[1003] gave this name to detached fertile pinnules from the Lower\r\nPermian of Saxony, which he described as _Scolecopteris elegans_. He\r\nrecognised the fern nature of the sori and suggested that the pinnules\r\nmight belong to the fronds of one of the “Staarsteinen” (_Psaronius_),\r\na view which subsequent investigations render far from improbable.\r\nThe sori, which occur in two rows on the lower surface of the small\r\npecopteroid segments with strongly revolute margins (fig. 291, H–K),\r\ncontain 4–5 sporangia attached to a stalked receptacle comparable\r\nwith that of _Marattia Kaulfussii_. These pedicellate synangia were\r\nfully described by Strasburger[1004], who decided in favour of a\r\nMarattiaceous alliance. The lower portions of the distally tapered\r\nsporangia are concrescent, the distal ends being free (fig. 291,\r\nH). Stur includes in _Scolecopteris_ the common species _Pecopteris\r\narborescens_ (fig. 376), but Kidston[1005] states that the British\r\nexample of _Scolecopteris_ is _S. polymorpha_, Brongn. from the Upper\r\nCoal-Measures.\r\n\r\n_Scolecopteris elegans_ Zenk. furnishes an example of a plant, or plant\r\nfragment, which has been assigned to the animal kingdom. Geinitz[1006]\r\ndescribed silicified pinnules as _Palaeojulus dyadicus_, the generic\r\nname being chosen because of the resemblance to Millipedes such as\r\nthe genus _Julus_. The mistake is not surprising to anyone who has\r\nseen a block of siliceous rock from Chemnitz crowded with the small\r\npinnules with their concave surfaces formed by the infolding of the\r\nedges. Sterzel[1007], who pointed out the confusion between Myriapods\r\nand Filices, has published figures which illustrate the deceptive\r\nresemblance of the pinnules, with their curved lamina divided by\r\nlateral veins into segments, to the body of a Millipede (fig. 291, K).\r\nHe points out that Geinitz searched in vain for the head and legs of\r\n_Palaeojulus_ and expressed the hope that further examination would\r\nlead to fresh discoveries: the examination of sections revealed the\r\npresence of sporangia and demonstrated the identity of _Palaeojulus_\r\nand _Scolecopteris_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Discopteris._\r\n\r\nStur[1008] instituted this genus for fertile fronds from the Upper\r\nCarboniferous Schatzlarer beds, including two species _Discopteris\r\nkarwinensis_ and _D. Schumanni_. He described the small Sphenopteroid\r\npinnules as characterised by disc-shaped sori made up of 70–100\r\nsporangia attached to a hemispherical receptacle: the absence of a\r\ntrue annulus led him to refer the genus to the Marattiaceae. In his\r\nmemoir on the coal-basin of Heraclea (Asia Minor), Zeiller[1009]\r\ninstituted the species _Sphenopteris_ (_Discopteris_) _Rallii_ and\r\nfigured sporangia resembling those described by Stur in the possession\r\nof a rudimentary “apical annulus.” He compared the sporangia with\r\nthose of recent Osmundaceae and Marattiaceae. In the later memoir on\r\nthe Upper Carboniferous and Permian plants of Blanzy and Creusot,\r\nZeiller[1010] gives a very full and careful description of fertile\r\nspecimens of _Sphenopteris_ (_Discopteris_) _cristata_, a fern\r\noriginally described by Brongniart as _Pecopteris cristata_[1011]. Many\r\nof the Sphenopteroid pinnules of this quadripinnate fern frond show\r\nthe form and structure of the sori with remarkable clearness in the\r\nadmirable photographs reproduced in Plates I.–III. of Zeiller’s Blanzy\r\nmemoir. The lobed pinnules of this species are of oval-triangular\r\nform, 5–15 mm. long and 2·5–6 mm. broad[1012]. An examination of the\r\ntype-specimens of _Discopteris_ from Vienna enabled Zeiller to correct\r\nStur’s original description of the sori: he found that the Austrian\r\nand French specimens, though specifically distinct, undoubtedly belong\r\nto one genus. The sori in _Discopteris cristata_ are globular, as in\r\nthe recent genera _Cyathea_ and _Alsophila_, and frequently cover\r\nthe whole face of the lamina. The individual sporangia are 0·4–0·5\r\nmm. long and 0·15–0·2 mm. in diameter; they are exannulate, but for\r\nthe annulus is substituted a group of thicker-walled and larger\r\ncells in the apical and dorsal region. The description by Stur of a\r\nhemispherical receptacle seemed to indicate an important difference\r\nbetween the Austrian and French species; but Zeiller found that this\r\nfeature does not actually exist and that it was so described as the\r\nresult of misinterpretation. Zeiller succeeded in isolating spores,\r\n40–50 μ in diameter, from some of the sporangia of _D. cristata_ and\r\nfound that they exhibited the three-rayed pattern characteristic of\r\nfern-spores and which is indicative of their formation in tetrads. The\r\nconclusion arrived at is that the genus _Discopteris_, as represented\r\nby _D. karwinensis_, _D. cristata_ etc., may be regarded as a true\r\nfern and included in the Marattiaceae. As Zeiller points out, the\r\nsori of _Discopteris_ differ from those of recent Marattiaceae in\r\ntheir pluriseriate construction and agree in this respect with those\r\nof the Cyatheaceae. The comparison already made[1013] between the\r\nsporangia of _D. Rallii_ and those of recent Osmundaceae holds good:\r\nthe genus affords another example of a generalised type, in this case\r\nprobably a fern, combining features which are now distributed among the\r\nMarattiaceae, Osmundaceae and Cyatheaceae.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nIn addition to genera founded on true synangia or groups of free\r\nor partially united sporangia, the literature of Palaeozoic ferns\r\ncontains several generic names applied to sporangia which occur\r\nsingly on Sphenopteroid or Pecopteroid pinnules. The following may\r\nserve as examples; but it should be stated that these will probably\r\nbe transferred eventually to the Pteridosperms. It is, however,\r\nimmaterial whether they are dealt with here or in the chapter devoted\r\nto the seed-bearing “ferns.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Dactylotheca._\r\n\r\nZeiller[1014] created this genus for fertile fronds of _Pecopteris\r\ndentata_ Brongn. (= _P. plumosa_ Artis[1015]), a common British species\r\nin the Upper and Middle Coal-Measures.

Pls.\r\n        XXVI.–XXVIII.\r\n\r\nFor a fuller synonymy reference should be made to Kidston’s account of\r\nthis species[1017], from which the above list is compiled. The large\r\nfronds of this species are tri- or quadripinnate. The pinnules vary\r\nmuch in shape and size and in degree of lobing, according to their\r\nposition on the frond (fig. 293). The primary pinnae are subtended by\r\ntwo Aphlebiae (fig. 293, A) appressed to the rachis, like the delicate\r\nleaves of the recent fern _Teratophyllum aculeatum_ (see page 301). The\r\nsporangia (0·5–0·65) are oval and exannulate and are attached parallel\r\nto the lateral veins; they may occupy the whole of the space between\r\nthe midrib and the edge of the pinnules. This species occurs in the\r\nUpper, Middle, and Lower Coal-Measures of Britain, reaching its maximum\r\nin the Upper Coal-Measures. The aphlebiae undoubtedly served to protect\r\nthe young fronds, as shown by a specimen figured by Kidston (fig. 293,\r\nB); they may also have served other purposes, as suggested by the\r\nabove comparison with _Teratophyllum_, in the mature frond. Lindley\r\nand Hutton regarded the aphlebiae as leaves of a fern climbing up the\r\nrachis; which they named _Schizopteris adnascens_, a confusion similar\r\nto that already mentioned in the description of _Hemitelia capensis_\r\n(see p. 304).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 292. _Dactylotheca plumosa._ (After Kidston.\r\n  Slightly reduced.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 293. _Dactylotheca plumosa_: A. Rachis with\r\n  Aphlebiae. B, _a_, young pinnae circinately folded. (After Kidston.\r\n  A, B, ⅘ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Renaultia._\r\n\r\nThis name was proposed by Zeiller[1018] for Upper Carboniferous fertile\r\npinnae of the Sphenopteroid type, bearing ovoid sporangia either\r\nsingly or in marginal groups of 2 to 5 at the ends of the veins. The\r\nappearance of the apical cells occasionally suggests the presence of a\r\nrudimentary annulus. Kidston has recorded this type of fructification\r\nin Britain[1019]. Stur describes fertile pinnules of the same type\r\nunder the generic name _Hapalopteris_[1020].\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Zeilleria._\r\n\r\nThis genus was founded by Kidston[1021] for fertile pinnae of a very\r\ndelicate fern, _Zeilleria delicatula_ (Sternb.) characterised by\r\nfiliform ultimate segments bearing an indusium-like body, spherical\r\nwhen immature and splitting at maturity into four small valves.\r\nKidston, in his earlier paper, compared the species with recent\r\nHymenophyllaceae. In the same genus he includes _Z. avoldensis_[1022]\r\n(Stur) assigned by Stur to _Calymmatotheca_, a genus described by some\r\nauthors as characterised by groups of radially elongated sporangia at\r\nthe tips of the pinnules; these supposed sporangia are now known to be\r\nthe valves of an indusium-like organ or cupule, as Stur asserted. There\r\ncan be little doubt that the fertile fronds placed in _Calymmatotheca_\r\nand in _Zeilleria_ were borne by Pteridosperms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Urnatopteris._\r\n\r\nThe Upper Carboniferous fronds of a delicate Sphenopteris habit, to\r\nwhich this name was assigned by Kidston[1023], were described by\r\nhim as _Eusphenopteris tenella_ (Brongn.)[1024] and compared with\r\nHymenophyllaceae; subsequently Kidston expressed the opinion that\r\n_Urnatopteris_ may be a Marattiaceous fern, as Williamson[1025]\r\nbelieved; he has since suggested that the sporangia are the\r\nmicrosporangia of a Pteridosperm[1026]. The sterile and fertile pinnae\r\ndiffer in the absence of a lamina in the latter. The sporangia (or\r\nmicrosporangia) are characterised by a poricidal dehiscence.\r\n\r\nThe records from strata higher in the geological series than the\r\nPermian, disregarding many of doubtful value, afford ample testimony to\r\nthe existence of Marattiaceae in Upper Triassic and Rhaetic floras.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Marattiopsis._\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Danaeopsis_ was applied by Heer[1027] to an Upper\r\nTriassic fern, previously described by Presl as _Taeniopteris\r\nmarantacea_. A splendid specimen from the Keuper of Stuttgart is\r\nfigured in Schimper’s Atlas[1028] showing the pinnate habit of the\r\nfrond and the broadly linear segments, 25 cm. × 3·5 cm., bearing rows\r\nof contiguous sporangia. The large pinnules have a strong midrib\r\ngiving off curved and forked lateral veins. Presl’s species may most\r\nappropriately be included in the genus _Marattiopsis_. A specimen of\r\n_M. marantacea_ described by Leuthardt[1029] as _Danaeopsis marantacea_\r\nfrom the Upper Trias of Basel shows a peculiarity in the venation;\r\nthe lateral veins often fork near their origin, as noticed by other\r\nauthors, but each vein forks a second time near the edge of the lamina\r\nand the two arms converge, forming a series of intramarginal loops\r\n(fig. 265, B).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marattiopsis Muensteri_ (Goepp.). Fig. 245, D, E.\r\n\r\nThis widely spread Rhaetic plant affords the best example of a\r\npost-Permian species which may be accepted as an authentic record of\r\nfossil Marattiaceae. Various generic names have been used for this\r\nspecies; Goeppert originally described the plant as _Taeniopteris\r\nMuensteri_[1030]; Schimper[1031] proposed the name _Marattiopsis_, and\r\nSchenk[1032] substituted _Angiopteris_ on the ground that the fertile\r\npinnules resemble that genus rather than _Marattia_. _Marattiopsis_, if\r\ninterpreted as indicating a _family_ resemblance rather than special\r\naffinity to the genus _Marattia_, would seem to be the more appropriate\r\ndesignation.\r\n\r\nThis species has been figured by several authors and in many instances\r\nwith fertile pinnules; the best illustrations are those published by\r\nZeiller[1033] in his monograph of Tonkin plants.\r\n\r\n  The pinnate fronds are characterised by a broad rachis bearing\r\n  sessile broadly linear pinnules rounded at the base, obtusely\r\n  pointed at the apex, reaching a length of 15–20 cm. and a breadth\r\n  of 12–35 mm. From a well-marked midrib are given off secondary\r\n  veins dichotomously branched close to their origin. The linear\r\n  synangia near the ends of the veins contain two rows of sporangial\r\n  compartments and open as two valves as in _Marattia_. (Cf. fig.\r\n  245, A, p. 320.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DANAEOPSIS]\r\n\r\nThis species occurs in the Rhaetic beds of Scania, Franconia, and\r\nTonkin. A similar type is figured by Fontaine from Jurassic beds in\r\nCalifornia as _Angiopteridium californicum_[1034], and Bartholin[1035]\r\nand Moeller[1036] record _M. Muensteri_ from the Lias of Bornholm.\r\nSchenk’s species from China[1037], _Angiopteris Richthofeni_, is\r\na closely allied species, and a similar form is recorded from\r\nJurassic and Caucasian strata[1038]. The microscopical examination by\r\nNathorst[1039] of a group of spores from a synangium of _M. Muensteri_\r\nshows that they resemble those of recent Marattiaceae.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nFrom the Upper Triassic plant beds of Lunz, Stur has included several\r\nspecies of ferns in the Marattiaceae, and of these Krasser[1040]\r\nhas recently published full diagnoses but unfortunately without\r\nillustrations. In addition to _Marattiopsis marantacea_ (Presl) the\r\nlist includes species referred to _Coniopteris_, to _Speirocarpus_,\r\na genus founded by Stur, to _Oligocarpia_, _Asterotheca_, and\r\n_Bernouillia_ (Heer).\r\n\r\nAs already pointed out, some at least of these Austrian ferns are more\r\nprobably Osmundaceous than Marattiaceous.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Danaeopsis Hughesi_, Feistmantel.\r\n\r\nThe pinnate fronds described by Feistmantel[1041] from the Middle\r\nGondwana rocks of India and recorded from Rhaetic strata in South\r\nAfrica[1042], China[1043], and Tonkin[1044], may belong to a member of\r\nthe Marattiaceae, but no fertile specimens have been described. The\r\nclose agreement between the sterile leaves from India and South Africa\r\nand the fertile fronds of _Marattiopsis marantacea_ suggests generic\r\nidentity.\r\n\r\nThe Upper Triassic ferns described by Heer, Krasser[1045],\r\nand Leuthardt[1046] as _Bernouillia_ have been referred to the\r\nMarattiaceae, but without trustworthy evidence in favour of this\r\naffinity.\r\n\r\nThe large leaves, 70 cm. long and 7 cm. broad, described by Zigno[1047]\r\nfrom the Jurassic of Italy as _Danaeites Heeri_, are probably Cycadean.\r\nThe Polish Jurassic species _Danaea microphylla_[1048] is a more\r\nsatisfactory record.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 294.\r\n\r\n  A, B. _Nathorstia angustifolia_, Heer. (After Heer. A, nat. size.)\r\n  C, D. Sorus of _N. latifolia_, Nath. (After Nathorst.

The resemblance of the long\r\npinnules to the fertile segments of _Laccopteris_ is so close that\r\ngeneric identity might well be assumed, but it has recently been\r\nshown by Nathorst[1050] that the soral characters justify Heer’s\r\nuse of a distinctive name for the Arctic fern. The circular sori\r\narranged in two rows (fig. 294, A, B) are superficially identical with\r\nthose of _Laccopteris_, but consist of concrescent sporangia forming\r\na circular synangium (fig. 294, C, D) like those of _Kaulfussia_\r\nand _Ptychocarpus_. The lighter areas in fig. 294, D, represent\r\nthe sporangia: fig. C shows the radial disposition of the numerous\r\nsporangial compartments round a central receptacle. From a stout midrib\r\nlateral veins arise at right angles, but their distal terminations are\r\nnot preserved. It is probable, as Nathorst suggests, that Bayer’s[1051]\r\nspecies _Drynaria fascia_ from the Lower Cretaceous rocks of Bohemia\r\nshould be referred to Heer’s genus. In the absence of well-preserved\r\nsori it would be exceedingly difficult, or even impossible, to\r\ndistinguish between pinnules of _Laccopteris_ and _Nathorstia_.\r\n\r\nA Tertiary species, _Marattia Hookeri_ (fig. 261, C, p. 350), described\r\nby Gardner and Ettingshausen[1052] from the Eocene beds of the Isle of\r\nWight is referred by them to the Marattiaceae because of a resemblance\r\nof the sterile pinnae to those of _M. Kaulfussii_; but this is\r\ninsufficient evidence of relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n                              Psaronieae.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis family name, first suggested by Unger, may be conveniently adopted\r\nfor the numerous species of petrified tree-fern stems characteristic\r\nof the Lower Permian and Upper Carboniferous strata. In his monograph\r\n_Über die Staarsteine_ published in 1854, Stenzel[1053] referred to\r\nthe Psaronieae as a special subdivision of the Filices most nearly\r\nallied to the Polypodiaceae. There is now a consensus of opinion in\r\nfavour of including _Psaronius_ in the Marattiales, or at least of\r\nregarding the genus as more closely allied to the Marattiaceae than to\r\nany other family. While admitting that the balance of evidence is in\r\nfavour of this view, it is probably wiser to retain the distinctive\r\nterm Psaronieae on the ground that species of _Psaronius_ differ in\r\nseveral respects from any recent ferns, and because of our comparative\r\nignorance in regard to the nature of the fructification.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Psaronius._\r\n\r\nThis generic name was proposed by Cotta in his classic work _Die\r\nDendrolithen_[1054]. The stems so named, formerly included by\r\nSprengel[1055] in the genus _Endogenites_, had long been familiar as\r\npetrified fossils. Most of the specimens described by the earlier\r\nwriters were obtained from Lower Permian rocks in the neighbourhood of\r\nChemnitz, Saxony. The mottled appearance presented by their polished\r\nsurfaces is said to have given rise to the appellation _Staarsteine_\r\n(starling stones), a term expressing a resemblance, more or less\r\nremote, to a starling’s breast. It has been suggested that this word\r\nis a corruption of _Stern Steine_ or star stones[1056], a descriptive\r\nterm suggested by the stellate arrangement of the vascular strands in\r\ntransverse sections of the roots. Parkinson[1057], in his _Organic\r\nRemains of a former World_, speaks of these stems as starry stones.\r\nThe history of our knowledge prior to 1854 is summarised by Stenzel.\r\nAt first compared with corals or the stems of sea-lilies, _Psaronii_\r\nwere recognised by Sprengel, who first used a lens in the examination\r\nof the fossils, as fern stems most nearly allied to those of recent\r\nCyatheaceae. By other authors, e.g. Schlotheim and Sternberg, they\r\nwere referred to Palms, and by Brongniart considered to be the lower\r\nportions of Lycopodiaceous (_Lepidodendron_) stems. Corda and many\r\nsubsequent authors selected the Marattiaceae as the most closely allied\r\nfamily among existing plants.\r\n\r\n_Psaronius_ is represented by specimens obtained from the Lower Permian\r\nof Saxony and Upper Carboniferous rocks in Central France, also from\r\nBohemia, Brazil and North America. As yet a few fragments only have\r\nbeen found in the English Coal-Measures. The genus was recognised by\r\nWilliamson[1058] who described the roots and a small piece of the\r\nvascular tissue of a stem which he called _P. Renaulti_, and this\r\ntype has since been more fully described by Scott[1059]. The roots\r\nof another species have been described by Butterworth[1060] as _P.\r\nCromptonensis_.\r\n\r\nIt was pointed out in the account of _Lepidodendron_ that several\r\ngeneric names have been used for the same type of stem in different\r\nstates of preservation; in _Psaronius_ accidents of fossilisation have\r\nbeen responsible for a similar confusion in nomenclature. The name\r\n_Psaronius_ is applied to petrified specimens which, as a rule, lack\r\nexternal features. Casts or impressions of Palaeozoic tree-fern stems\r\nprovided with leaf-scars are described as species of _Caulopteris_,\r\n_Megaphyton_, and less commonly as _Ptychopteris_ (figs. 297–299).\r\nThe first name is applied to stems exhibiting spirally disposed\r\nleaf-scars like those of recent tree-ferns; in _Megaphyton_ the scars\r\nare distichously arranged, in two rows, while _Ptychopteris_ is applied\r\nto decorticated stems. These terms are used for stems belonging to one\r\ngeneric type and possessing the structure of Psaronius stems.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 295. _Psaronius_ stem with roots. (Much reduced.\r\n  After Grand’Eury.)]\r\n\r\nThe researches of Grand’Eury[1061] led to the discovery that certain\r\nPsaronius stems bore fronds of the _Pecopteris_ type some of which\r\nbore sori of the _Asterotheca_ or _Scolecopteris_ type. The same\r\nauthor[1062] has also contributed many interesting facts, obtained by\r\nan examination of the relation of Psaronius stems to the sediments\r\nof French Coal-fields in which they occur, in regard to habitat\r\nand manner of growth. The specimen represented in fig. 295 shows a\r\nportion of a Psaronius stem, the upper part of which illustrates the\r\nCaulopteris state of preservation, while the lower part is covered\r\nby a mass of roots. It is probable, as Rudolph[1063] suggests, that\r\nthis rich development of roots, which gives to an old Psaronius stem\r\nthe appearance of an elongated cone, may have served an important\r\nmechanical purpose analogous to the secondary thickening in a\r\nDicotyledon or a Conifer. A specimen of _Psaronius Cottai_ in the\r\nHofmuseum, Vienna, is cited in illustration of the enormous breadth\r\nof the root-system: the radii of the stem proper and of the encasing\r\ncylinder of roots bear the ratio 17 to 165. The comparatively frequent\r\noccurrence of a lacunar cortex in the roots points to the growth of\r\nthe stems in swampy ground, a conclusion in harmony with the evidence\r\nafforded by the anatomical features of many other Palaeozoic genera.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\n_Psaronius_ may be briefly defined as follows:—\r\n\r\n   Tree-fern stems, occasionally reaching a height of 50 feet\r\n  or more, closely resembling in habit recent tree ferns, but\r\n  exhibiting in the structure and arrangement of the vascular system\r\n  a close agreement with recent Marattiaceae. Leaves, in such cases\r\n  where a connexion between fronds and stems is known, large and\r\n  highly compound and of the _Pecopteris_ type, borne in more or\r\n  less crowded spirals (_Psaronius polystichi_), in four rows (_P.\r\n  tetrastichi_), or in two opposite rows (_P. distichi_). Leaves\r\n  deciduous, leaving a clearly defined oval scar containing the\r\n  impression of the leaf-trace in the form of an open =U=, or a\r\n  closed oval with a small inverted =V=-shaped band a short distance\r\n  below the upper end of the long axis of the oval (figs. 297, 298);\r\n  in _Megaphyton_ the alternate scars of the two opposite series\r\n  are larger and characterised by a different form of meristele.\r\n  The surface of the cortex below the leaf-scars occasionally shows\r\n  impressions of pits similar to the lenticel-like organs on recent\r\n  Tree-fern stems. The central region of the stem is occupied by a\r\n  complex system of concentrically disposed steles (dictyosteles),\r\n  which in transverse section present the appearance of flat or\r\n  curved bands varying in extent and in degree of curvature. The\r\n  vascular bands consist of xylem surrounded by a narrow zone of\r\n  phloem; the xylem is composed either exclusively of tracheae or\r\n  of tracheae and parenchyma; the protoxylem in the one instance in\r\n  which it has been clearly recognised is endarch[1064]. The steles\r\n  are embedded in parenchymatous tissue and in some species are\r\n  associated with mechanical tissue (e.g. _P. infarctus_, fig. 296,\r\n  A, B). The central or vascular region of the stem may be surrounded\r\n  externally by a cylinder of mechanical tissue interrupted by\r\n  outgoing leaf-traces and adventitious roots. The leaf-traces\r\n  arise as single bundles from an internal stelar band and pursue\r\n  an obliquely radial course towards the outside, eventually\r\n  anastomosing with peripheral cauline steles, which in some species\r\n  form with the leaf-traces the outermost zone of the vascular\r\n  region. The leaf-traces have the form of loops which pass into the\r\n  petioles as =V=-shaped meristeles or closed oval cylinders. As a\r\n  leaf-trace passes out compensating strands occupy the foliar gap.\r\n\r\n  The vascular region is surrounded by a parenchymatous cortex, which\r\n  in younger plants, or in the apical region of an older plant, forms\r\n  the surface of the stem to which the leaf-stalks are attached.\r\n  From the peripheral steles, or from the more external bands of\r\n  the vascular network, roots are given off which pass in a sinuous\r\n  vertical course through the cortex, appearing on the surface\r\n  between the leaf-bases. In older stems, after leaf-fall, the tissue\r\n  immediately external to the vascular region produces secondary\r\n  parenchyma with which the roots become intimately associated by\r\n  their outermost cells. As a result of the secondary cortical\r\n  development and the gradual increase in the number of roots\r\n  invading the cortical tissue from above, the stem is enclosed by a\r\n  cylinder of roots and associated parenchymatous tissue of secondary\r\n  origin. In still older portions of a stem the more external roots\r\n  are free from the stem-cortex and form a thick felted mantle, which\r\n  increases in thickness towards the base of the tree.\r\n\r\n  The roots (fig. 296, E) are polyarch, 5–10 groups of xylem\r\n  alternating with strands of phloem, and similar in structure to\r\n  those of recent species of _Marattia_ and _Angiopteris_; the\r\n  stele is enclosed by an inner cortex of compact or lacunar tissue\r\n  containing secretory sacs, and this is surrounded by a cylinder of\r\n  mechanical tissue. In one or two instances secondary xylem has been\r\n  observed wholly or partially enclosing the root-stele[1065].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 296.\r\n\r\n  A. _Psaronius infarctus_ (P, peripheral steles; L, leaf-traces).\r\n  B. _P. infarctus_, longitudinal tangential section through the\r\n     peripheral region of the stem.\r\n  C. _P. coalescens._\r\n  D. _P. musaeformis._\r\n  E. _P. asterolithus_ (root).\r\n\r\n  (A—C, E, after Zeiller; D, after Stenzel.)]\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the anatomy of _Psaronius_ is based largely on\r\nthe investigations of Stenzel considerably extended by Zeiller’s\r\nmore intensive studies and, more recently, by the later work of\r\nStenzel[1066] and that of Rudolph. A striking fact, which has led to\r\nvarious suggestions, is that in a transverse section of a _Psaronius_\r\nstem with its encasing cylinder of roots no signs of leaf-traces are\r\nmet with in the root-region. If the roots simply penetrated the cortex,\r\nas in some recent species of _Lycopodium_ (fig. 125, A) or as in\r\n_Angiopteris_, we should expect to find leaf-traces in the outer region\r\n(root-cylinder) of Psaronius stems. An explanation of the absence of\r\nleaf-traces which was suggested by Stenzel, is that the cortical zone\r\nformed a comparatively narrow band in the young leaf-covered stem;\r\nafter leaf-fall it became the seat of active growth in its inner layers\r\nand so produced a constantly widening zone of secondary parenchyma,\r\nwhich pushed the superficial cortical tissue with the leaf-bases or\r\nleaf-scars farther out until it was exfoliated. Farmer and Hill[1067]\r\nfind it difficult to accept this explanation; but, as Rudolph shows,\r\nthe radial arrangement of the cortical cells between the adventitious\r\nroots and their elongation in a radial direction are arguments in\r\nsupport of the secondary nature of the cortical zone.\r\n\r\nIn sections of the adventitious roots of _Psaronius Renaulti_ figured\r\nby Williamson[1068], the spaces between the cylindrical roots\r\nare partially occupied by cell-filaments which, at first sight,\r\nsuggest root-hairs; it may well be, as Rudolph suggests, that these\r\nfelted hairs represent the outermost and looser part of the growing\r\nsecondary cortex which gradually passes into the covering mass of free\r\nextra-cortical roots.\r\n\r\nAs Stenzel[1069] has shown, slender stems of _Zygopteris_ (=\r\n_Ankyropteris_) are occasionally met with growing through the web of\r\nPsaronius roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Psaronius infarctus_ Unger. Fig. 296, A, B.\r\n\r\nThis species, which Zeiller[1070] has investigated from sections of\r\nUnger’s material, illustrates a type in which the vascular tissue is\r\nvery richly developed and forms crowded concentric series of curved\r\nplates associated, in the more peripheral series, with bands of\r\nmechanical tissue. The outermost part of the vascular region consists\r\nof (i) a series of loops or variously curved bands of conducting\r\ntissue representing leaf-traces at different stages in their outward\r\ncourse, (ii) a series of similar vascular strands (peripheral steles\r\nof Zeiller) confined to the stem (cauline) and from which roots are\r\ngiven off, and (iii) bands of mechanical tissue associated with the\r\nleaf-traces and peripheral steles. The peripheral steles (fig. 296, A,\r\nB, p) form anastomoses with the leaf-traces and contribute to their\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nThe form of some of the vascular bands in the section of _Psaronius\r\ninfarctus_ shown in fig. 296, A, illustrates the occasional\r\nanastomosing of one dictyostele with another: the different degrees\r\nof looping of other bands represent stages in the giving off of\r\nleaf-traces which eventually pass out as =V=-shaped meristeles. Beyond\r\nthe leaf-traces and sclerenchymatous bands the section consists of\r\ntransverse sections of adventitious roots.\r\n\r\nThe surface-features of _Psaronius infarctus_ are probably represented,\r\nas Zeiller points out, by the cast described by Lesquereux as\r\n_Caulopteris peltigera_ (fig. 298, A).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 297. _Pecopteris Sterzeli_: a, pinnule. (After\r\n  Renault and Zeiller. ¹⁄₁₁ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nThe Psaronius shown in fig. 297 is one of the few examples illustrating\r\nthe connexion between fronds and stem. The leaf (_Pecopteris Sterzeli_\r\nZeill. and Ren.[1071] is quadripinnate and is described as reaching a\r\nlength of at least 3 metres; the ultimate segments are entire or lobed.\r\nThe stem is characterised by elliptical scars, 6–8 cm. x 3·5–4 cm.,\r\nwith leaf-traces like those in _Caulopteris peltigera_. The fronds of\r\n_Pecopteris Pluckeneti_, a Pteridosperm, bear a very close resemblance\r\nto those of _P. Sterzeli_, which are as yet known only in a sterile\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\n_Psaronius brasiliensis_ Unger, a species founded by Unger on a\r\npiece of silicified stem acquired by Martius in Brazil and now\r\nin the Rio Museum, is a good example of a tetrastichous species.\r\nSolms-Laubach[1072] has recently told the history of this type, which\r\nis represented by sections, cut from the Rio stem, in several European\r\ncollections. A well-preserved section in the British Museum is figured\r\nby Arber[1073] in his catalogue of the Glossopteris flora and by other\r\nauthors. Scott gives a concise description of the species in his\r\n_Studies in Fossil Botany_[1074]. The roots of _P. brasiliensis_ are\r\nstated by Pelourde[1075] to have a lacunar cortex.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Psaronius musaeformis_ Corda[1076]. Fig. 296, D.\r\n\r\nThis species from the Lower Permian of Chemnitz and the Coal-Measures\r\nof Bohemia affords an example of the distichous type in which the\r\nleaves are borne in two rows. The vascular bands, as seen in a\r\nsection of the dictyosteles, occur in regular parallel series. The\r\nstelar region is separated from the cylinder of encasing roots by a\r\nsclerenchymatous sheath, broken at intervals where roots pass out from\r\nthe vascular region.\r\n\r\n_Psaronius coalescens_[1077] (fig. 296, C) illustrates a somewhat\r\ndifferent arrangement of vascular tissue which approaches more\r\nclosely to the polycyclic structure characteristic of such recent\r\nferns as _Matonia_ and _Saccoloma_. A still closer resemblance to\r\nthe solenostelic type is seen in _Psaronius Renaulti_ from the Lower\r\nCoal-Measures of England which Scott[1078] describes as characterised\r\nby a single annular stele, interrupted only by the exit of leaf-traces.\r\nAs he points out, it is noteworthy that this species is distinguished\r\nby the simplest form of stele met with in the genus; it is the oldest\r\nspecies and may be regarded as the most primitive representative of\r\nthe genus _Psaronius_ so far discovered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 298.\r\n\r\n  A. _Caulopteris peltigera_.\r\n  B. _Megaphyton insigne_.\r\n\r\n  (After Grand’Eury.)

The vascular tissue of the petiole is\r\nrepresented by a =U=-shaped impression on the scar, the ends of the =U=\r\nbeing incurved, or by a closed oval ring with a wide-open and inverted\r\n=V= near its upper end. The surface between the leaf-scars bears\r\nthe impression of adventitious roots. _Caulopteris_ is represented,\r\nin the Upper Coal-Measures of England, by _C. anglica_[1080] Kidst.\r\nThe species _C. peltigera_ (fig. 298, A), originally described by\r\nBrongniart as _Sigillaria_, illustrates the closed form of leaf-trace\r\nand, as Zeiller suggests, it is the cast of a _Psaronius_ stem which\r\npossessed a vascular system on the same plan as that of _P. infarctus_.\r\n_C. Saportae_[1081] illustrates the open =U=-shaped type of petiole\r\nstele.\r\n\r\n_Caulopteris peltigera_ has scars measuring 6–9 by 4–6 cm.; it occurs\r\nin the Commentry Coal-field of France in association with the fronds\r\nknown as _Pecopteris cyathea_, a species which Kidston regards as\r\nidentical with _P. arborescens_[1082].\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ii. _Megaphyton_.\r\n\r\nThe first use of this name was by Artis[1083], who gave it to a long\r\nflattened cast, _Megaphyton frondosum_, found in Carboniferous strata\r\nin Yorkshire, characterised by two vertical rows of large scars and by\r\nimpressions of sinuous roots. Kidston records the genus from the Middle\r\nand Upper Coal-Measures of Britain. A good example of this type of cast\r\nis afforded by _M. McLayi_ Lesq.[1084] from the Coal-Measures of North\r\nAmerica, which has been recognised in European Carboniferous rocks.\r\nThe leaf-scars are rounded or oval, broader than high; the vascular\r\nimpression has the form of a closed ring (5–8 × 3–6 cm.), more or less\r\ncircular and with a tendency to a rectangular outline, characterised by\r\na deep inverted =U=-shaped sinus in the middle of the lower surface and\r\nby a =W=-shaped impression of an internal strand (fig. 298, B)[1085].\r\n\r\n\r\n                         iii. _Ptychopteris_.\r\n\r\nThis generic name, instituted by Corda[1086], is applied to\r\ndecorticated stems of _Psaronius_, the surface of which is that of the\r\nvascular region on which the form of the leaf-scars is more or less\r\nclearly defined. The scar-areas are limited by an impression of the\r\nsclerenchymatous sheath enclosing the leaf-meristele, and internal\r\nto this is the impression of the leaf-trace. In some specimens a\r\nlayer of coaly material which represents the carbonised cortex and\r\nadventitious roots covers the _Ptychopteris_ cast. The _Ptychopteris_\r\ncast represented in fig. 299 shows the decorticated surface of part of\r\na long stem on which the leaf-scars are arranged as in _Megaphyton_. An\r\nexample of _Ptychopteris_ is figured by Fontaine and White[1087] from\r\nVirginia as _Caulopteris gigantea_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 299. _Ptychopteris._ ⅙ nat. size. From the Middle\r\n  Coal-Measures of Lancashire.

It is,\r\nhowever, important not to overlook the differences between _Psaronius_\r\nand recent genera of Marattiaceae, or the resemblances between the\r\nextinct genus and the Cyatheaceae. In habit _Psaronius_ agrees closely\r\nwith recent tree-ferns; in the vascular system and in the sequence\r\nof events connected with the production of leaf-traces, there are\r\nstriking resemblances between _Psaronius_ and the Cyatheaceous fern\r\n_Saccoloma adiantoides_ (= _Dicksonia Plumieri_ Hook.) as described\r\nby Mettenius[1088]. The piece of stem of _Dicksonia antarctica_\r\nrepresented in fig. 300 exhibits a fairly close agreement with species\r\nof _Psaronius_, e.g. _P. infarctus_ (fig. 296, A, B). Moreover, the\r\nperipheral steles, which Zeiller has shown are confined to the stem\r\nand play an important part in the production of the roots and in the\r\nanastomoses with leaf-traces, are not represented in any Marattiaceous\r\nfern; on the other hand, they are comparable with the accessory strands\r\nmet with in stems of recent Cyatheaceous tree-ferns[1089] (cf. fig.\r\n240). The complex system of concentric dictyosteles is a feature\r\nmore closely matched in _Angiopteris_ (Marattiaceae) than in any\r\nCyatheaceous genus, the chief difference being in the more band-like\r\nform of the steles in _Psaronius_, though in a stem of _Angiopteris_\r\nfigured by Mettenius we see a close approach to the extinct type. The\r\nposition of the protoxylem has unfortunately not been clearly defined\r\nin _Psaronius_ stems, but in _P. Renaulti_ it is stated by Scott[1090]\r\nto be endarch, a position which some of the protoxylem strands occupy\r\nin _Angiopteris_[1091]. The occurrence of large sieve-tubes described\r\nby Scott in _P. Renaultii_ is another feature shared by recent\r\nMarattiaceae. In many of the continental species of _Psaronius_ the\r\nphloem has not been preserved, and our knowledge of this tissue is\r\ncomparatively meagre. In the Marattiaceae the roots arise mainly from\r\nthe inner portions of the stele, while in _Psaronius_ they are usually\r\nformed from the external vascular bands. The formation of secondary\r\ncortical tissue is a peculiarity of _Psaronius_; on the other hand, if\r\nButterworth[1092] is correct in referring to that genus the roots with\r\nsecondary xylem, which he describes as _P. Cromptonensis_, a comparison\r\nmay be made with the occurrence of secondary tracheae in the stem\r\nsteles of _Angiopteris_[1093].\r\n\r\nThe absence of mechanical tissue in the stem of _Angiopteris_ is\r\nin contrast with its occurrence in the fossil stems and in recent\r\ntree-ferns; but this is a character of secondary importance and one\r\nwhich can be readily explained by the difference in habit between\r\n_Angiopteris_ and _Psaronius_.\r\n\r\nThe roots of _Psaronius_, more especially as regards the stelar\r\nstructure, are in close agreement with those of Marattiaceae.\r\n\r\nThe reference to Marattiaceae of the great majority of fertile\r\nfern-like fronds from Permian and Carboniferous rocks constituted a\r\nstrong _a priori_ argument in favour of including _Psaronius_ stems\r\nin the same family, especially when it was known that leaves with\r\nMarattiaceous synangia were borne by species of this genus. It is,\r\nhowever, well to remember the change in our views as to the dominance\r\nof Marattiaceae in Palaeozoic floras consequent on the discovery of\r\nthe Pteridosperms. The association of fronds bearing _Asterotheca_ and\r\n_Scolecopteris_ types of fructification with _Psaronius_ stems recorded\r\nby Grand’Eury[1094] is a point in favour of the Marattiaceous affinity\r\nof this extinct genus, but it is not impossible that _Psaronius_ stems\r\nbore fronds which produced Pteridosperm organs of reproduction. In\r\nthis connexion the specimen represented in fig. 297 is of interest,\r\nas the fronds (_Pecopteris Sterzeli_) borne on the _Psaronius_ stems\r\nare hardly distinguishable from the seed-bearing leaves known as\r\n_Pecopteris Pluckeneti_.\r\n\r\nThe position of _Psaronius_ may be best expressed by assigning it\r\nto a separate family, the Psaronieae, as advocated by Stenzel, and\r\nby regarding it as one of the many instances of a generalised type\r\nwhich in the sum of its characters approaches most nearly to the\r\nMarattiaceae.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n                       Ophioglossales (Fossil).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fossils hitherto classed with the Ophioglossales are not such as\r\nafford any satisfactory evidence in regard to the past history or\r\nphylogeny of the group. In the generalised class of Palaeozoic ferns,\r\nthe Botryopterideae, we find certain characters suggesting comparison\r\nwith recent members of the Ophioglossaceae, but no trustworthy records\r\nof these eusporangiate ferns are furnished by the older plant-bearing\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 301. _Rhacopteris_ sp., Ballycastle, Ireland. From\r\n  a specimen in the Manchester Museum. [M.S.]]\r\n\r\nThe genus _Rhacopteris_ (fig. 301), characteristic of the Culm flora,\r\nhas been compared with _Botrychium_, but on grounds which are wholly\r\ninadequate. The species _R. paniculifera_ Stur[1095] is characterised\r\nby a stout rachis bearing two rows of laterally attached rhomboidal\r\nor subtriangular segments with a more or less deeply lobed margin\r\nand spreading veins. The rachis branches distally into two arms, and\r\nthese are again symmetrically subdivided into fertile axes bearing\r\nclusters of small spherical bodies 1 mm. broad, which Stur speaks of as\r\nexannulate sporangia similar to those of _Botrychium_. He includes the\r\nspecies in the Ophioglossaceae. As Zeiller[1096] pertinently remarks,\r\n_Rhacopteris_ differs essentially in habit from any recent member of\r\nthis family. _Rhacopteris_ also includes species characterised by\r\nleaflets deeply dissected into linear segments; an example of this\r\nform is represented by _Rhacopteris flabellata_ (Tate) recorded by\r\nKidston[1097] from rocks of Calciferous Sandstone age in Flintshire.\r\n\r\nThe specimen described by Renault[1098] from the Carboniferous rocks\r\nof Autun as _Ophioglossites antiqua_ is equally unconvincing: it\r\nconsists of a carbonised fragment, 7 cm. × 1·5 cm., regarded as part\r\nof a fertile lamina characterised by a vertical series of transversely\r\nelongated slits, 7 mm. wide, some of which, on slight magnification,\r\nare seen to contain a mass of small orange-yellow granulations.\r\nThe slits are compared with the surface-openings of the sunken\r\nsporangia of _Ophioglossum_, and the yellow bodies are identified as\r\nspores. The material is too imperfect to justify the use of the name\r\n_Ophioglossites_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Noeggerathia._\r\n\r\nThis genus of uncertain position may be briefly described here,\r\nthough it has little claim to recognition as a representative of the\r\n_Ophioglossales_. It is characteristic of Lower Carboniferous rocks and\r\nis compared by Stur[1099] with recent Ophioglossaceae. _Noeggerathia\r\nfoliosa_ Sternb. (fig. 302) may be cited as a typical example of the\r\ngenus. It consists of an axis bearing ovate leaves with numerous\r\nspreading veins. The upper part of the axis forms a spike composed of\r\nfertile leaves in the form of transversely oval bracts 2 cm. broad with\r\na serrate edge bearing on the upper face several sporangia (3 × 4 mm.)\r\nin some of which spores have been seen (fig. 302, B, C). In another\r\nform described by Weiss[1100] the bracts bear a greater number of\r\nsporangia characterised by the presence of an arillus-like basal ring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 302. _Noeggerathia foliosa._ (After Stur; A,\r\n  reduced.) B, Fertile leaf; C, Sporangium.]\r\n\r\nGeinitz[1101], who first described fertile specimens of _Noeggerathia_,\r\nplaced the genus in the Gymnosperms, and O. Feistmantel[1102] was in\r\nfavour of this view. C. Feistmantel[1103], who described the small\r\nbodies in the sporangia, suggested comparison with Schizaeaceae, and\r\nWeiss[1104] discussed various possibilities, asking but not answering\r\nthe question, are the so-called sporangia rightly so named or are\r\nthey fruits? Potonié[1105] places the genus in the Cycadofilices. An\r\nimportant feature is the occurrence of the sporangia on the upper face\r\nof the bracts as in Lycopodiales and _Sphenophyllum_, but in other\r\nrespects _Noeggerathia_ bears no resemblance to these two groups.\r\nSterile examples of the genus are similar in habit to _Rhacopteris_,\r\nbut in the latter genus the leaves or leaflets are laterally\r\nattached and not obliquely inserted. Further, we may assume that in\r\n_Rhacopteris_ the segments are leaflets of a compound leaf, whereas\r\nin _Noeggerathia_ they are probably single leaves. We must leave the\r\nposition of this Lower Carboniferous genus undecided, merely expressing\r\nthe opinion that it is perhaps more nearly allied to the Cycads than to\r\nany other group.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 303. _Chiropteris Zeilleri_, Sew. [From a specimen\r\n  in the British Museum (v. 3268). Nat. size.]]\r\n\r\nThe plant figured by Lindley and Hutton from the English Coal-Measures\r\nas _Noeggerathia flabellata_, which some authors quote as a species of\r\n_Noeggerathia_, is generally recognised as a _Psygmophyllum_ and placed\r\nwith some hesitation in the Ginkgoales.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Chiropteris._\r\n\r\nThis genus was founded by Kurr on a leaf characterised by anastomosing\r\nvenation from Keuper beds near Stuttgart. A resemblance in form and\r\nvenation to the leaves of recent species of _Ophioglossum_ led authors\r\nto suggest the inclusion of Kurr’s specimen in the Ophioglossaceae.\r\nWe have, however, no justification for considering _Chiropteris_ as a\r\nmember of this family; it may be a fern, and that is all that can be\r\nsaid. The leaf represented in fig. 303 is the type-specimen of a South\r\nAfrican Rhaetic species _Chiropteris Zeilleri_[1106]. The genus is\r\nrecorded also from Rhaetic rocks in Queensland.[1107]\r\n\r\nNewberry[1108] describes some leaves from the Lower Cretaceous of\r\nMontana as species of _Chiropteris_: one of his types, _C. spatulata_,\r\nis almost certainly a _Sagenopteris_, similar to _S. Phillipsi_ (figs.\r\n327, 328) or _S. Mantelli_. A second species, _C. Williamsii_, is\r\nprobably not generically identical with the specimen represented in\r\nfig. 303.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n                 Coenopterideae.  ╭   I. Botryoptereae.\r\n                                  ╰ II. Zygoptereae.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term Botryopterideae, first used by Renault, has been applied to a\r\ngroup of Palaeozoic ferns ranging from the Lower Carboniferous to the\r\nPermian and containing several genera, the distinguishing features of\r\nwhich are supplied by the anatomical structure of the stems or, in many\r\ncases, by that of the petiolar vascular strand. Scott[1109] subdivides\r\nthe Botryopterideae into the Botryopteris and the Zygopteris sections.\r\nIn an admirable monograph recently published by Paul Bertrand[1110]\r\nconsiderable changes are proposed in current nomenclature; he\r\nsubstitutes the name Inversicatenales for Botryopterideae, a\r\ndesignation, which as Scott remarks, is “probably too technical to\r\ncommand general acceptance.” A more serious criticism is that the name\r\nInversicatenales has reference to a character (the inverse curvature\r\nof the leaf-trace in relation to the axis of the stem) which is by no\r\nmeans universal in the group[1111].\r\n\r\nIn the following account, necessarily incomplete, the generic\r\nterminology of Bertrand is adopted, but this decision does not carry\r\nwith it any obligation to accept the name Inversicatenales. We may\r\nspeak of the types of Palaeozoic ferns dealt with in the following\r\npages as members of a group differing in many respects from any\r\nexisting genera of the Filicales, and exhibiting the characteristics\r\nassociated with generalised plants. Williamson, as early as 1883,\r\nspoke of Renault’s Botryopterideae as comprising “altogether extinct\r\nand generalised” types[1112]. For these generalised Palaeozoic ferns\r\nI propose to use the name Coenopterideae[1113]. This term may be\r\nadopted in a wider sense than Renault’s name Botryopterideae. The\r\nname Primofilices proposed by Arber[1114] might be employed, but the\r\nimplication which it carries is an argument against its adoption. We\r\nhave not yet reached a stage in the investigation of extinct types at\r\nwhich we are able to recognise what are actually primary or primitive\r\nferns. The search for origins will continue; as new discoveries are\r\nmade our point of view shifts and the primitive type of to-day may\r\nto-morrow have to take a higher place. The epithet primitive or primary\r\nis in reality provisional: to adopt such a name as Primofilices\r\nsuggests a finality which has not been, or is likely to be, achieved.\r\nThe true ancestral type—the _Urform_—which we strive to discover eludes\r\nthe pursuer like a will-o’-the-wisp.\r\n\r\nSeeing that the number of true ferns of Palaeozoic age has been\r\nrecently considerably reduced and is likely to suffer further\r\nreduction, the consideration of such undoubted Carboniferous and\r\nPermian examples of the Filicales as are left acquires a special\r\nimportance. In the first place it is natural to ask whether the\r\nPalaeozoic ferns include any types which, if not themselves ancestral\r\nforms, may serve to indicate the probable lines of evolution of\r\nexisting families. It is probable that in the near future our knowledge\r\nof the Coenopterideae will be considerably extended; as yet we possess\r\nmeagre information in regard to those characters on which most stress\r\nhas generally been laid in the classification of recent ferns,\r\nnamely the structure of the spore-bearing organs. The sporangia of\r\n_Diplolabis_ and _Stauropteris_ (figs. 309, A; 322) are exannulate;\r\nin the former genus they occur in sori or synangia consisting of a\r\nsmall number of sporangia, while in the latter they are borne singly\r\nat the tips of ultimate ramifications of a highly compound leaf. The\r\nresemblance of the synangium of _Diplolabis_ to that of _Kaulfussia_\r\n(fig. 245, C) is not shared in an equal degree by the sporangia of\r\n_Stauropteris_, which are in some respects comparable with those of\r\nthe Ophioglossaceae. In the Zygoptereae, or at least in the case of\r\nsuch fertile fronds as are known, and in _Botryopteris_ (fig. 319),\r\nthe sporangia occur in groups, and the pedicel of each sporangium\r\nis supplied with vascular tissue as in _Helminthostachys_. Another\r\ncharacteristic of the sporangia of the extinct types is the possession\r\nof an annulus several cells in breadth, a peculiarity which supplies a\r\npoint of contact with the Osmundaceae. In the sporangia of _Kidstonia_\r\nwe have a similar though not an identical type (fig. 256, E, p. 340).\r\nSo far, then, as the evidence afforded by sporangial characters is\r\nconcerned, it points to comparison with the Ophioglossaceae, the\r\nOsmundaceae, and the Marattiaceae. When we compare the steles of the\r\nstems we find a wide range of structure. All the genera agree in being\r\nmonostelic; in _Tubicaulis_ and _Grammatopteris_ the protoxylem is\r\nexarch, in _Botryopteris_ it is internal, while the foliar strand of\r\n_Stauropteris_ and the stele of _Ankyropteris corrugata_ are mesarch.\r\nThe axillary branching of species of _Ankyropteris_ suggests comparison\r\nwith the Hymenophyllaceae.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of the vascular system of the petioles has afforded\r\nresults which in the hands of P. Bertrand have led to conclusions in\r\nregard to inter-relationships. We must, however, not overlook the\r\ndanger of attributing can excessive importance to this single criterion\r\nand of neglecting the facts of stem anatomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           I. Botryoptereae.\r\n\r\n                           _Grammatopteris._\r\n\r\nRenault instituted this genus for petrified stems from the\r\nPermo-Carboniferous beds of Autun. _Grammatopteris Rigolloti_[1115],\r\nthe type-species, is represented by a fragment, 12–15 mm. in diameter,\r\nsurrounded by crowded petioles characterised by a vascular strand in\r\nthe form of a short and comparatively broad plate with the smallest\r\ntracheae at each end. The solid xylem of the stem stele (protostele)\r\nhas peripheral groups of protoxylem. Nothing is known as to the\r\nform of the leaves, but sporangia similar to those of _Etapteris_\r\n(_Zygopteris_) were found in association with the stem. It is possible,\r\nas P. Bertrand suggests, that Renault’s species may be the stem of a\r\n_Tubicaulis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Tubicaulis._\r\n\r\n_Tubicaulis solenites_ (Sprengel)[1116]. Fig. 304.\r\n\r\nThis species from the Lower Permian of Saxony has been fully described\r\nby Stenzel[1117]. It is characterised by a very slender erect stem\r\nbearing numerous spirally disposed leaves associated with adventitious\r\nroots; the single stele (protostele) consists exclusively of tracheae,\r\ndescribed as intermediate between the scalariform and reticulate type,\r\nsurrounded by phloem. Leaf-traces are given off from the periphery\r\nof the stele where groups of smaller elements occur; these have the\r\nform of a wide-open =U=-shaped strand with the base of the =U= facing\r\nthe axis of the stem. As the trace passes out towards the leaves, the\r\nends of the =U= become more or less incurved. The stem is said to\r\nreach a metre in length and to bear compound fronds a metre long. The\r\norientation of the leaf-trace with its concavity turned outwards is in\r\nstriking contrast to the relation between leaf-trace and stem in recent\r\nferns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 304. _Tubicaulis solenites._ (From Tansley, after\r\n  Stenzel.) Stem and petioles: the latter numbered in the order of\r\n  their age.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tubicaulis Sutcliffii_, Stopes[1118].\r\n\r\nIn this species the vascular axis, 2 mm. in diameter, is almost\r\ncylindrical and of the protostelic type with the protoxylem “near\r\nto or at the edge”: the tracheae are scalariform or reticulate. The\r\nleaf-traces, when first separated from the edge of the stele, are oval\r\nand gradually assume the curved form seen in _T. solenites_ (fig. 304)\r\nwith the convex side towards the axis of the stem. The transition from\r\nthe scalariform to the reticulate type of pitting on the tracheal walls\r\nreferred to by Miss Stopes has also been noticed in some recent ferns\r\n(e.g. _Helminthostachys_) and in _Sigillaria_ (fig. 200, C, p. 212).\r\nThe fact that the scalariform type of pitting is practically universal\r\nin the xylem of recent ferns, would seem to show that this character\r\nhas been acquired in the course of evolution and retained in preference\r\nto the reticulate form characteristic of several Palaeozoic species.\r\nThe distinction between the two methods of pitting is one of little\r\nphylogenetic importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Botryopteris._\r\n\r\nThis genus, founded by Renault on a specimen from Autun, is represented\r\nin the Lower Coal-Measures of England by _Botryopteris hirsuta_ (=\r\n_Rachiopteris hirsuta_ Will.), _B. ramosa_ (= _R. ramosa_ Will.[1119])\r\n(fig. 306) and _B. cylindrica_ (fig. 305), also by _B. antiqua_ (fig.\r\n307) from the Culm of Pettycur, Scotland.\r\n\r\nAn important characteristic of the genus is the solid stele of the stem\r\nwhich agrees with that of _Tubicaulis_ and _Grammatopteris_, except in\r\nthe central or peripheral position of the smallest tracheae.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Botryopteris forensis_ Renault[1120]. Figs. 309, B; 319, D–G.\r\n\r\nThe stem of this species from the Upper Carboniferous of St Étienne\r\nis 1·7 cm. x 7·5 mm. in diameter. The solid stele consists of\r\nreticulate tracheae with the smallest elements on the outer edge.\r\nThe comparatively broad cortex of the type-specimen is traversed by\r\na leaf-trace in an almost vertical course and by vascular strands\r\npassing horizontally to roots. The petioles are circular in section\r\nand their vascular strand has the form of an ω in transverse section\r\n(fig. 319, G), the three projecting arms pointing to the axis of the\r\nstem. Both stem and leaves bore large multicellular hairs, spoken of\r\nby Renault as equisetiform because of the finely toothed sheaths of\r\nwhich they are composed. The compound fronds had fleshy lobed pinnules\r\nwith dichotomously branched veins (fig. 309, B); stomata are said to be\r\nconfined to the upper surface, an observation which leads Renault to\r\ndescribe the plant as aquatic on evidence which is hardly convincing.\r\n\r\nThe pyriform and pedicellate sporangia are borne in groups of two to\r\nsix on the ultimate divisions of the frond; the wall is composed of\r\ntwo layers of cells and on one side of the sporangium is an annulus\r\nseveral cells in breadth (fig. 319, D, F). An interesting type of\r\nsporangium described by Oliver[1121] from Grand’Croix in France may,\r\nas he suggests, belong to _Botryopteris forensis_; the differences\r\nbetween Renault’s and Oliver’s specimens being the result of the more\r\nperfect preservation of the tissues in the latter. The sporangium\r\ndescribed by the English author is circular in section and measures\r\n0·65 × 0·53 mm.; the wall is in part composed of a single layer of\r\ncells and in part of two to three layers, a character recalling the\r\n“annulate” sporangia of _Botryopteris_. Between the spore-mass and the\r\nwall is an interrupted ring of short tracheal elements similar to the\r\nxylem-mantle which occurs at the periphery of the nucellus of certain\r\nPalaeozoic gymnospermous seeds. In the absence of proof of a connexion\r\nbetween this sporangium and _Botryopteris_ it is convenient to use the\r\ngeneric name _Tracheotheca_ subsequently proposed by Oliver[1122].\r\nIn the recent ferns _Helminthostachys_ and _Botrychium_, and, as\r\nOliver notices, in the microsporangia of the Australian Cycad _Bowenia\r\nspectabilis_, vascular strands extend almost to the sporogenous tissue,\r\nbut the fossil sporangium is unique in having a tracheal layer in\r\nimmediate contact with the spores. These xylem elements may, as Oliver\r\nsuggests, have served the purpose of conveying water to the ripening\r\nspores.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Botryopteris hirsuta_ (Will.)[1123].\r\n\r\nThis English species has a slender axis bearing numerous leaves with\r\npetioles equal in diameter to the stem. The surface of the vegetative\r\norgans bears large multicellular hairs. The leaf-traces resemble\r\nthose of _B. forensis_, but the projecting teeth which terminate in\r\nprotoxylem elements are less prominent than in the French species;\r\nthe petioles were named by Felix _Rachiopteris tridentata_[1124]. As\r\na leaf-trace passes into the stele of the stem the three protoxylem\r\nstrands unite and take up an internal position in the solid stele. The\r\nstele may, therefore, be described as endarch. The small tracheae at\r\nthe edge of the stele supply the xylem strands of adventitious roots.\r\n\r\nSporangia similar to those of _B. forensis_ have been found in\r\nassociation with the English species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Botryopteris cylindrica_ (Will.). Fig. 305.\r\n\r\nA plant originally described by Williamson[1125] from the Lower\r\nCoal-Measures of England as _Rachiopteris cylindrica_ (fig. 305)\r\nand afterwards more fully dealt with by Hick[1126], has a slender\r\nstem with a cylindrical stele characterised by well-defined central\r\nprotoxylem elements in one or two groups. The leaf-traces are\r\nsemi-lunar in section with the protoxylem on the flatter side. The\r\nstele of _Botryopteris cylindrica_ (fig. 305, A) is more cylindrical\r\nin section than that of _B. ramosa_ (fig. 306) and shows more clearly\r\nthe differentiation into smaller central and larger peripheral\r\ntracheae. In the section reproduced in fig. 305, B the stele is giving\r\noff a branch almost identical in structure with the main vascular\r\naxis. Scott[1127], in referring to the inclusion of this type in the\r\ngenus _Botryopteris_, expresses the opinion that its habit must have\r\nbeen very different from that of other species, and he suggests the\r\ninstitution of a new genus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 305. _Botryopteris cylindrica_ (× 30). From\r\n  sections in the Cambridge Botany School.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Botryopteris ramosa_ (Williamson). Fig. 306.\r\n\r\nThis species, which bears a close resemblance to _Botryopteris\r\nhirsuta_, was originally described by Williamson from the Lower\r\nCoal-Measures of England as _Rachiopteris ramosa_[1128], the specific\r\nname being chosen on account of the numerous and crowded branches\r\ngiven off from the main axis. The section shown in fig. 306, A,\r\nillustrates Williamson’s description of the stem as being “always\r\nsurrounded [when seen in transverse sections] by a swarm of similar\r\nsections of the large and small branches, though of varying shapes and\r\nsizes.” The stele is composed of a solid and more or less cylindrical\r\nrod of xylem tracheae of the reticulate type surrounded by phloem\r\n(figs. A and D): one or more internal groups of smaller protoxylem\r\nelements occur in an approximately central position (fig. A, _px_).\r\nThe stele is in fact endarch like those of _Selaginella spinosa_ and\r\n_Trichomanes reniforme_, a feature which, as Tansley[1129] believes,\r\nprobably entitles the vascular axis to be considered a primitive form\r\nof protostele. In the specimens represented in fig. 306 the phloem\r\nand inner cortical tissues were almost completely destroyed before\r\npetrifaction. The thick-walled outer cortex bears at its periphery\r\nnumerous multicellular hairs. Some of the xylem strands given off from\r\nthe stele no doubt supplied adventitious roots, but in most cases the\r\noutgoing branches are leaf-traces and the numerous sections of axes\r\nof different sizes seen in fig. A point to a repeated subdivision of\r\nthe crowded fronds. The structure of a petiole is shown in figs. C and\r\nD. As seen in fig. C, the oval vascular strand has three protoxylem\r\ngroups, _px_, on its flatter side; a well-defined epidermal layer is\r\nshown at _e_ in fig. C.\r\n\r\nFig. B shows at _a_ a section of a leaf-axis in the act of branching\r\nand the row of branchlets at _b_ represents a further stage in\r\nsubdivision. At _sp_ in fig. A the section has cut through a single\r\nsporangium characterised by a group of larger (“annulus”) cells on one\r\nside of the wall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 306.

Fig. 307.\r\n\r\nThis species, recently described by Kidston[1130] from the Culm of\r\nPettycur near Burntisland, is represented by sections of a small\r\nstem with a cylindrical stele 0·40 mm. in diameter composed entirely\r\nof scalariform tracheae without any recognisable protoxylem. The\r\npetioles are larger than the stem; the meristele (fig. 307) is oval\r\nwith protoxylem elements on the slightly more rounded adaxial face.\r\nAs Kidston suggests, this stem may belong to a scrambling plant which\r\nrequired support to bear its relatively large leaves. An interesting\r\nfeature is the absence of projecting teeth in the leaf-trace, a\r\ncharacter in marked contrast to the ω form assumed by the petioles of\r\n_Botryopteris forensis_ (fig. 319, G) and _B. hirsuta_. This leads\r\nKidston to suggest that the vascular strand of the petiole tends “to\r\nbecome more simple ... as traced back in geological time.” The greater\r\nsimilarity in this species between the stele of the stem and that of\r\nthe petiole is probably another mark of a more primitive type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 307. _Botryopteris antiqua_: Petiolar vascular\r\n  strand. (After Kidston: × 65.)]\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nIn these three types, _Grammatopteris_, _Tubicaulis_, and\r\n_Botryopteris_, we have monostelic plants, for the most part of very\r\nsmall size, with leaf-traces varying in shape from the oblong band-form\r\nin _Grammatopteris_, and the oval form of _Botryopteris antiqua_, to\r\nthe ω type represented in its most pronounced form by _B. forensis_. In\r\nseveral species the stem stele is endarch. Our knowledge of the leaves\r\nis very meagre: in _B. forensis_ they were repeatedly branched and\r\napparently bore small fleshy pinnules; the sporangia, though differing\r\nfrom those of recent ferns, may be compared with the spore-capsules\r\nof Osmundaceae as regards the structure of the annulus. The abundance\r\nof hairs on the stems and leaves of some species, the tracheal sheath\r\nin the sporangium described by Oliver[1131] as _Tracheotheca_ (=\r\n_Botryopteris?_), and the apparent absence of a large well-developed\r\nlamina, may perhaps be regarded as evidence of xerophilous conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           II. Zygoptereae.\r\n\r\nCorda[1132] proposed the generic name _Zygopteris_ for petrified\r\npetioles from the Permian of Saxony, included by Cotta in his genus\r\n_Tubicaulis_, which he named _T. primarius_. Corda’s genus has been\r\ngenerally used for petioles of Palaeozoic ferns characterised by\r\na vascular strand having the form of an =H= in transverse section\r\n(fig. 308, D). Since the generic name was instituted, information\r\nhas been obtained in regard to the nature of the stems which bore\r\nsome of the petioles of the _Zygopteris_ type; and for other species\r\nof _Zygopteris_, the stems of which are still unknown, new generic\r\nnames have been proposed. P. Bertrand[1133] retains _Zygopteris_ for\r\none species only, _Z. primaria_. Fig. 308, D, shows the character of\r\nthe petiolar vascular strand; the chief points are the comparatively\r\nlong cross-pieces (antennae of P. Bertrand) inclined at an angle of\r\n45° to the plane of symmetry of the petiole axis, and the groups of\r\nprotoxylem elements shown by the white patches in fig. D. In this as in\r\nother members of the Zygoptereae the main rachis of the leaf gives off\r\nfour sets of branches in pairs alternately from the right and left side\r\nof the primary vascular axis. This method of branching of the stele in\r\nthe primary rachis of several members of the Coenopterideae shows that\r\nthe fronds bore pinnae laterally disposed, in some cases in one row\r\nand in others in two rows on each side of the rachis. In a typical fern\r\nfrond, as represented by recent and most fossil species, branching\r\nof the rachis occurs in the plane of the frond, that is in the plane\r\nrepresented by the horizontal arm of xylem in _Zygopteris primaria_\r\nconnecting the two antennae or cross-pieces. In the Zygoptereae the\r\nbranches from the petiole vascular axis lie in a plane at right angles\r\nto that of the frond; they lie in the transverse and not in the\r\nhorizontal plane. The two strands shown in fig. 308, B, 4, have been\r\nformed by the division of a single strand, 3, in the transverse plane\r\n(i.e. in the plane of the paper). As Tansley[1134] points out, a type\r\nof branching superficially similar to, though not identical with this,\r\nis seen in some recent species of _Gleichenia_ and _Lygodium_. In\r\nthis connexion it is worthy of note that a fern figured by Unger from\r\nThuringia as _Sphenopteris petiolata_ Goepp[1135] bears pinnae in two\r\nrows on the rachis which are characterised by repeated branching and by\r\na very narrow lamina or by slender naked axes; the occurrence of this\r\nform of frond in rocks containing _Clepsydropsis antiqua_ (fig. 308,\r\nA) suggests a possible connexion between the petrified rachis and the\r\nimpressions of the leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 308.\r\n  A. _Clepsydropsis antiqua._\r\n  B. _Etapteris Scotti._\r\n  C. _Diplolabis forensis._\r\n  D. _Zygopteris primaria._\r\n  E–G. _Stauropteris oldhamia._\r\n\r\n  The white patches in the xylem in figs.

The main rachis has a stele similar to that of\r\n_Zygopteris primaria_, but distinguished by its greater similarity,\r\nin transverse section, to an =X= rather than to the letter =H=: the\r\nlong transverse bar in _Zygopteris_ is here much reduced in size.\r\nThe petiole of _Diplolabis forensis_[1137] Ren. (fig. 308, C) has a\r\ndiameter of 1·5–2 cm. From the antennae a pair of small bundles is\r\ngiven off alternately from the right and left side, as in _Zygopteris_;\r\nthe members of each pair coalesce after leaving the antennae and then\r\nseparate to pass into the lateral branches of the frond. The position\r\nof the protoxylem and the formation of the lateral xylem strands\r\nprevious to their separation are shown in fig. 308, C. On the side of\r\nthe vascular strand shown in fig. C, 2, the two lateral extensions\r\nof the antennae are converging towards one another previous to their\r\nseparation and subsequent union. The ovoid sporangia occur in groups\r\nof three to six and are coalescent below with a central receptacle;\r\nthey have no annulus, but the cells on the side next the receptacle are\r\nsmaller than those on the external wall (fig. 309, A). The synangial\r\nform of the sorus suggests comparison with Marattiaceae.\r\n\r\nThe species described by Renault from the Culm of Esnost is regarded by\r\nP. Bertrand as identical with that described by Solms, from the Culm\r\nof Falkenberg, as _Zygopteris Roemeri_[1138]. _Diplolabis_ is compared\r\nby P. Bertrand with _Metaclepsydropsis_, the generic name given to the\r\nLower Carboniferous petiole described by Williamson as _Rachiopteris\r\nduplex_[1139].\r\n\r\nMr Gordon has recently described in a preliminary note a new type\r\nof stem stele under the name _Zygopteris pettycurensis_ from the\r\nLower Carboniferous plant bed of Pettycur[1140]: he regards the\r\npetioles attached to the stem as identical with _Zygopteris Roemeri_\r\nSolms-Laubach[1141]. This species, founded by Solms-Laubach on\r\npetioles only, is placed by Bertrand[1142] in the genus _Diplolabis_\r\nand regarded as identical with _D. esnostensis_ Ren. The stele found\r\nby Mr Gordon may therefore be assigned to the genus _Diplolabis_:\r\nit includes two regions composed exclusively of tracheae and is\r\ncylindrical in transverse section. The inner xylem zone consists of\r\nshort, square-ended, reticulately pitted elements and the outer zone\r\nis composed of long and pointed conducting tracheae. The scalariform\r\nprotoxylem elements are situated between the two metaxylem zones.\r\nAs Mr Gordon says: this type of stem occupies a position “in the\r\nZygopteroid alliance” corresponding to that which _Thamnopteris\r\nSchlechtendalii_ (p. 329) occupies in the Osmundaceous series. The\r\ndiscovery of this stem supplies another link between the two fern\r\ngroups, Osmundaceae and Coenopterideae. Pelourde[1143] has described\r\nan imperfectly preserved vascular strand from a locality near Autun as\r\nthe type of a new genus _Flicheia esnostensis_. Mr Gordon has pointed\r\nout to me that this is a partially rotted petiole of _Diplolabis\r\nesnostensis_ (= _Zygopteris Roemeri_).\r\n\r\nIn their recent account of fossil Osmundaceous genera, Kidston and\r\nGwynne-Vaughan[1144] speak of the central parenchyma of the existing\r\nmedullated stele as being derived from tracheal tissue. They add that\r\nif the Zygopteroid line of descent is at all close to the Osmundaceous,\r\nwe must be prepared for the existence of a _Zygopteris_ with a solid\r\nxylem like that of _Thamnopteris_: “such a discovery, in fact, we\r\nhopefully anticipate[1145].” The new Pettycur stem amply justifies this\r\nprophecy. It is noteworthy that Mr Gordon’s stem affords an instance\r\nof the occurrence of a type of stele, similar in its cylindrical form\r\nand in the absence of parenchyma to that of _Botryopteris_, in a plant\r\nbearing leaves characterised by the _Zygopteris_ type of vascular\r\nstrand.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Metaclepsydropsis duplex_ (Will.) fig. 310, A[1146]. [= _Rachiopteris\r\nduplex_, Williamson 1874. _Asterochlaena_ (_Clepsydropsis_) _duplex_,\r\nStenzel 1889. _Clepsydropsis_, Renault 1896.]\r\n\r\nThe vascular axis of the main axis of the frond is characterised by the\r\nhour-glass shape of the xylem which consists entirely of tracheae, most\r\nof which are reticulately pitted. In a transverse section (fig. 310,\r\nA) the two ends of the stele are dissimilar; at one end of the long\r\naxis is a small bay of thin-walled tissue (phloem) enclosed by a narrow\r\nband of xylem, and at the other the bay is open and has two protoxylem\r\ngroups. The latter represents the earliest stage in the production of\r\nsecondary bundles: at a later stage the bay is closed by the elongation\r\nof the edges, the enclosed group of phloem is vertically extended, and\r\nthe protoxylem strands are more widely separated. The curved band of\r\nxylem becomes detached as a curved arc and divides into two (fig. 310,\r\nA). In a single section of this species one often sees several strands\r\nof xylem enclosed in a common cortex with the main vascular axis; these\r\nare the xylem bundles of lateral pinnae. _Metaclepsydropsis duplex_\r\nshows the method of branching of the petiole vascular axis which has\r\nalready been noticed in _Diplolabis_ and _Zygopteris_. In reference\r\nto this feature, Williamson wrote in 1872—“I know of no recent fern\r\nin which the secondary branches of the petiole are thus given off in\r\npairs, which pairs are distichously arranged on the primary axis,\r\nand each of which secondary petioles sustains ternary ones arranged\r\ndistichously.” By slightly altering the primary stele of this type of\r\nfrond, by narrowing of the constricted portion of the hour-glass and\r\nextending the lateral groups of xylem obliquely upwards, the form of\r\nstele shown in fig. 310, A, would be converted into the _Diplolabis_\r\ntype (fig. 308, C).\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Clepsydropsis._\r\n\r\nUnger[1147] instituted this genus as a subdivision of Corda’s family\r\nRhaciopterideae[1148], the name having reference to the hour-glass\r\nform of the vascular axis[1149]. The type-species _C. antiqua_ (fig.\r\n308, A) is spoken of as the commonest fossil plant in the Devonian\r\nrocks of Thuringia. In some sections the xylem has the form seen in\r\nfig. 308, A, in which an invagination of thin-walled tissue occurs at\r\neach end; in other sections (fig. 308, A′) the bays become islands in\r\nthe xylem. Solms-Laubach speaks of Unger’s species as _Rachiopteris_\r\n(_Clepsydropsis_) _antiqua_. P. Bertrand[1150], who has recently\r\ndescribed Unger’s plant, while recognising that _C. antiqua_ and\r\n_Metaclepsydropsis duplex_ closely resemble one another, draws\r\nattention to certain differences in the structure of the xylem which he\r\nregards as sufficient to justify a generic separation. The leaf-traces\r\nof _Clepsydropsis_ are described by Bertrand as almost circular closed\r\nrings of xylem instead of an arc as in _Metaclepsydropsis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 310.\r\n\r\n  A. _Metaclepsydropsis duplex._\r\n  B, C. _Stauropteris oldhamia._\r\n  D. _Ankyropteris scandens._\r\n\r\n  [A, from a section in Dr Kidston’s Collection (Lower Carboniferous);\r\n  B, C, from sections in the Cambridge Botany School; D, after\r\n  Stenzel.]]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Ankyropteris._\r\n\r\nStenzel adopted this name for a subdivision of Corda’s genus\r\n_Zygopteris_, applying it to a species described by Renault as _Z.\r\nBrongniarti_, to a Permian species described by himself as _Z._\r\n(_Ankyropteris_) _scandens_, and to _Z. Lacattii_ Ren.; _Rachiopteris\r\nGrayi_ Will. and _Rachiopteris corrugata_ Will. are also included in\r\nthis genus. The characters emphasised by Stenzel[1151] are (i) the\r\ndouble anchor-like form of the =H=-shaped petiole strand in which the\r\nlateral arms (antennae) are curved like the flukes of an anchor, and\r\n(ii) the emission of four rows of branches instead of two. The latter\r\ndistinguishing feature no longer holds good, as _Z. primaria_ also\r\ngives off four rows of bundles and not two as Stenzel supposed. P.\r\nBertrand has adopted Stenzel’s genus in a narrower sense[1152].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 311. _Ankyropteris Grayi._ Stele. (From a section\r\n  in Dr Kidston’s Collection, × 18.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ankyropteris scandens_ Stenzel[1153]. Fig. 310, D.\r\n\r\nThis Lower Permian species is very similar to or perhaps identical with\r\n_Ankyropteris Grayi_ (Williamson). The stem of\r\n\r\n_A. scandens_ was found in association with the roots of a _Psaronius_\r\nstem evidently petrified _in situ_ as it burrowed, like _Tmesipteris_,\r\ntropical aroids, and other recent plants, among the living roots of\r\nthe tree-fern. The stem, 10–11 mm. in diameter, bore fronds with an\r\n=H=-shaped vascular strand, small scale-leaves, and adventitious roots.\r\nThe stele consists of a five-angled cylinder of scalariform tracheae\r\nsurrounding an axial strand of parenchyma containing scattered tracheae\r\nof smaller diameter. This axial tissue extends as a narrow strip\r\ninto each of the short and obtusely truncated arms (cf. fig. 311).\r\nA striking feature is the production of a shoot in the axil of the\r\nfoliage-leaves (fig. 310, D), a manner of branching characteristic of\r\n_Trichomanes_ (see page 365).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ankyropteris Grayi_ (Will.). Fig. 311.\r\n\r\nIn describing this species, Williamson wrote—“That no classification\r\nof these fossil ferns based solely upon transverse sections of the\r\npetiolar bundles is or can be of much value, is clearly shown when\r\ntested amongst those living ferns the classification of which is\r\nchiefly based upon the sporangial reproductive organs[1154].” This is\r\na view entirely opposed to that which inspires P. Bertrand’s recent\r\nmonograph. Whether the value attached to the vascular structure\r\nof petioles as a basis of classification is upheld or not, it is\r\nnoteworthy that since Williamson expressed his opinion, our knowledge\r\nof the anatomy of ferns and of the value of anatomical evidence\r\nhas enormously increased. The slender stem[1155] of this Lower\r\nCoal-Measures species agrees closely with that of _A. scandens_; it\r\nbore spirally disposed fronds, scale-leaves, and roots. The stele\r\nhas the form of an irregular five-rayed star (fig. 311) in which\r\nthe relative length of the arms varies in different sections owing\r\nto the separation of the distal ends to form leaf-traces. The axial\r\nregion is composed of parenchyma and associated narrow tracheae, as\r\nin _A. scandens_. The xylem, with protoxylem elements at the ends and\r\nespecially at the angles of the arms, is completely surrounded by\r\nphloem. The cortex consists internally of parenchyma which becomes\r\nthicker-walled towards the periphery and bears multicellular epidermal\r\nhairs. A leaf-trace is detached in the form of a triangular strand\r\nand is formed by the tangential extension of the distal end of an arm\r\nof the stele. The trace, on its way through the cortex, divides into\r\ntwo; the outer branch gradually changes from a slightly curved band to\r\nan =H=-shaped meristele; the inner branch, which supplied an axillary\r\nshoot, is similar to the stele of the stem, but smaller. Scott[1156]\r\nhas recently recorded the occurrence of scale-leaves (aphlebiae) in\r\nthis species like those described by Stenzel in _A. scandens_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 312.\r\n\r\n  A. _Thamnopteris Schlechtendalii._ Leaf-trace: _px_, protoxylem;\r\n     _s_, island of parenchyma.

The fossil described by Williamson as _R.\r\nirregularis_ or _inaequalis_[1159] are the secondary branches of _A.\r\nbibractensis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ankyropteris bibractensis_, var. _westphaliensis_. Figs. 312, C; 313.\r\n\r\nThe rachis stele of this species, which is represented by portions of\r\nfronds only, has the form of a double anchor (fig. 313); the antennae\r\nare continued at the outer edge of their distal ends into a narrow\r\nband (“filament” of P. Bertrand) (fig. 312, C, and 313, _a_) composed\r\nof smaller tracheae and separated from the xylem of the antennae by a\r\nstrip of thin-walled tissue (phloem?). A group of protoxylem occurs at\r\nthe junction of the filament and antennae. The whole of the xylem is\r\nsurrounded by phloem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 313. _Ankyropteris bibractensis_: _s_, stigmarian\r\n  rootlet; _a_, narrow loop of xylem. (Cambridge Botany School; × 6).]\r\n\r\nThe section reproduced in fig. 313 shows the characteristic form of the\r\npetiolar vascular axis, consisting of a horizontal band of metaxylem\r\nwith groups of much smaller tracheae on both the upper and lower\r\nmargins. At the junction between the antennae, curved like the flukes\r\nof an anchor, and the horizontal band of xylem, the latter is only one\r\ntrachea in breadth. The narrow loops of smaller xylem elements are\r\nshown on the outer edge, _a_ (fig. 313), of the antennae separated\r\nfrom the arcs of larger tracheae by a dark line which represents a\r\ncrushed band of delicate tissue. The spaces enclosed by the incurved\r\nantennae are largely occupied by parenchymatous ground-tissue.\r\nThe cylinder of outer cortex consists internally of comparatively\r\nthin-walled parenchyma succeeded externally by a zone of dark and\r\nthicker-walled cells characterised by a fairly regular arrangement in\r\nradial series, as if formed by a secondary meristem; there is, however,\r\nno indication of a meristematic layer. Below the small-celled epidermis\r\nare a few layers of thinner-walled cells which are not arranged in\r\nradial series. The structure of the outer part of the cortex is similar\r\nto that in the petiole of recent species of _Angiopteris_ (fig. 243, p.\r\n319) and _Marattia_, in which a more delicate hypoderm is succeeded by\r\na band of mechanical tissue.\r\n\r\nThe rachis of this type of frond gives off two rows of lateral branches\r\nfrom the vascular axis, the plane of symmetry being at right angles to\r\nthe primary rachis. Each pinna bore at its base two aphlebiae supplied\r\nwith vascular strands from the leaf-traces.\r\n\r\nWe have no certain information in regard to the sporangia of this\r\nspecies, but Scott points out that “pear-shaped sporangia, with a\r\nvery broad and extensive annulus, are commonly found associated with\r\n_Zygopteris bibractensis_ and _Z. corrugata_ in the petrifactions of\r\nthe English Lower Coal-Measures[1160].”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ankyropteris corrugata_ (Will.). Figs. 312, B; 314–317.\r\n\r\nThe stem of this type of Zygoptereae was described by Williamson from\r\nthe Lower Coal-Measures of Lancashire as _Rachiopteris corrugata_ and\r\nincluded by him in the sub-group Anachoropteroides. The stele (fig.\r\n314, B) is oval in transverse section; it consists of a cylinder of\r\nxylem tracheae enclosing a central region occupied by parenchymatous\r\ntissue and scattered narrow scalariform tracheae. The central tissue\r\nextends radially in the form of narrow arms which reach almost to the\r\nouter edge of the tracheal tissue and divide it up into 5–7 groups. A\r\ncylinder of thin-walled tissue encloses the xylem and in this occur\r\ngroups of large sieve-tubes (fig. 314, D, _Sv_).\r\n\r\nIn a section of this species in the Williamson Collection[1161] the\r\nlong axis of the stele has a length of 5 mm. and the diameter of the\r\nstem as a whole is 2·5 cm. The greater part of the extra-stelar tissue\r\nconsists of large parenchymatous cells passing near the periphery into\r\na band of darker and thicker-walled tissue.\r\n\r\nReniform vascular strands traverse the cortex in an obliquely\r\nascending course on their way to the leaves, also smaller bundles,\r\nsome of which are given off directly from the stele, while others are\r\nbranches of the petiole vascular strands. The petioles described by\r\nWilliamson as _Rachiopteris insignis_[1162] were afterwards recognised\r\nby him as those of _Ankyropteris corrugata_, though this conclusion\r\nwas not published[1163]. Williamson’s species _R. insignis_ must\r\nnot be confused with Unger’s Culm species _Arctopodium insigne_,\r\nwhich Solms-Laubach[1164] refers to as _Rachiopteris insignis_. The\r\nleaf-bundle of _Ankyropteris corrugata_ is at first reniform in contour\r\n(fig. 314, C, _P_), but as it becomes free from the stem it gradually\r\nassumes the =H=-shaped form (figs. 315–317). This petiolar strand\r\ndiffers from that of _Ankyropteris bibractensis_ (fig. 313) in the\r\nshorter and less strongly curved antennae; and, as Williamson first\r\nnoticed, the tracheae are frequently filled with thin-walled parenchyma\r\n(fig. 312, B). The existence of scale-leaves or aphlebiae like those of\r\n_Ankyropteris scandens_ and _A. Grayi_ has been recorded by Scott in\r\n_A. corrugata_[1165].\r\n\r\nThe section represented in fig. 314, C, shows the relatively small size\r\nof the stele _S_ in the stem of _Ankyropteris corrugata_. The main mass\r\nof the cortex consists of uniform parenchyma passing near the surface\r\ninto darker and stronger tissue: two vascular bundles are shown in the\r\ncortex, one of which forms the conducting strand of a petiole, _P_,\r\nwhich has nearly freed itself from the stem: the other bundle, as shown\r\nby the examination of a series of sections, eventually passes into\r\nanother leaf-stalk. A root of another plant has invaded the cortex at\r\n_R_, fig. 314, C.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 314. _Ankyropteris corrugata._ _R_, intruded root;\r\n  _P_, petiole; _S_, stele, _Sv_ sieve-tubes.\r\n\r\n  A, B. From a section in the University College Collection.\r\n  C. After Williamson.\r\n  D. From a section in the Williamson Collection (British Museum).]\r\n\r\nThe form and structure of the stele is diagrammatically represented\r\nin fig. 314, B. The outer portion (black) consists of a cylinder\r\nof scalariform tracheae in which the position of groups of smaller\r\nelements (protoxylem) is shown by the white patches. The xylem is\r\nthus seen to be mesarch. The prominent group of xylem on the lower\r\nright-hand side of the section consists of tracheae, cut across\r\nin an oblique direction, which are about to pass out as a separate\r\nstrand. The centre of the stele is occupied by parenchymatous tissue\r\nin which are included scattered tracheae, either singly or in small\r\ngroups. These medullary tracheae are rather narrower than those of the\r\nmain xylem cylinder. A characteristic feature is the radial outward\r\nextension into the xylem of the medullary parenchyma, which tends\r\npartially to divide the tracheal cylinder into broad groups.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 315. _Ankyropteris corrugata_ (Will.). Petiolar\r\n  vascular strand. [From a section in the University College (London)\r\n  Collection; after Tansley × 35.]]\r\n\r\nFig. 314, A, enlarged from fig. B, _a_, shows the mesarch position of a\r\nprotoxylem group, and a few of the parenchymatous cells of one of the\r\nnarrow arms of the axial tissue. At _Sv_ in fig. D a group of large\r\nsieve-tubes is seen separated from the xylem by a few parenchymatous\r\ncells, and beyond the sieve-tubes are some tangentially elongated\r\ncells. Both the sieve-tubes, _Sv_, and the flattened cells resemble\r\ntissues in a corresponding position in the steles of modern Osmundaceae.\r\n\r\nIn a section of _Ankyropteris corrugata_ in the Williamson Collection\r\nthe radial arrangement of the more external metaxylem elements suggests\r\nthe addition of secondary tracheae[1166]. This suggestion of secondary\r\nthickening, a point which requires much more thorough investigation,\r\nis interesting in relation to a new type of stem named by Scott\r\n_Botrychioxylon_[1167], but not yet fully described. This generic\r\nname has been given to a stem stele which closely resembles that of\r\n_Ankyropteris corrugata_ except in the regular radial arrangement of\r\nthe peripheral xylem elements. The name _Botrychioxylon_ was chosen by\r\nScott because of the secondary xylem characteristic of the recent genus\r\n_Botrychium_ (fig. 247, p. 322).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 316. _Ankyropteris corrugata._ Petiole. _a_,\r\n  narrow xylem loop; _b_, spaces in cortex. From a section in the\r\n  Cambridge Botany School Collection. (× 10.)]\r\n\r\nIn the petiolar vascular strand represented in fig. 315 the narrow band\r\nof tracheae which forms a loop external to the antennae is clearly\r\nseen, also the small-celled parenchyma between the loops and the larger\r\nmetaxylem elements of the antennae. The crushed tissue lying on the\r\nouter face of each of the loops probably represents the phloem and\r\npericycle; the thin-walled elements above and below the horizontal band\r\nof metaxylem are probably sieve-tubes.\r\n\r\nFig. 316 shows a transverse section of a petiole of this species: the\r\nloops, _a_, of small tracheae are seen bending round the outer edge of\r\nthe antennae. The inner and more delicate cortical tissue is partially\r\npreserved and spaces, _b_, have been formed in it as the result of\r\ncontraction previous to petrifaction. In the petiole represented in\r\nfig. 317 the tracheae of the horizontal band are considerably crushed;\r\nthe section is, however, of interest because of the presence of\r\n_Lyginodendron_ roots, _l_, in the space originally occupied by the\r\ninner cortex.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 317. _Ankyropteris corrugata._ From a section in\r\n  the Cambridge Botany School Collection. (× 9.)]\r\n\r\nIn a paper on the tyloses of _Rachiopteris corrugata_, Weiss[1168]\r\ndraws attention to the fact that similar inclusions have not been\r\nfound in the tracheae of recent ferns. The occurrence of thin-walled\r\nparenchymatous cells in the large tracheae of _Ankyropteris corrugata_\r\npetioles and of other species is a striking feature. Williamson[1169]\r\ncompared these cells with the tyloses in the vessels of recent\r\nflowering plants, and in a later paper[1170] he suggested that the\r\nincluded cells may belong to saprophytic or parasitic fungi. It is, as\r\nWeiss points out, difficult to explain the occurrence of tyloses in\r\ntracheae not immediately in contact with living parenchyma. It may be\r\nthat the pits in the tracheae of _Ankyropteris_ were open spaces as in\r\nthe xylem of recent ferns described by Gwynne-Vaughan, and if so this\r\nwould facilitate the invasion of the conducting elements by growing\r\ncells. A comparison is made by Weiss between certain cell-groups found\r\nby him in the tracheae of _Ankyropteris_ and by Miss Jordan[1171] in\r\nthe vessels of the recent dicotyledon _Cucumis sativus_. In a more\r\nrecent paper on tyloses Miss McNicol[1172] expresses the opinion that\r\npseudoparenchyma in the tracheae of the fossil petioles owes its origin\r\nto fungal hyphae.\r\n\r\nWilliamson compared the petiole bundles of _Ankyropteris corrugata_\r\nwith those of recent Osmundaceae, a comparison based on the structure\r\nof the leaf-trace before its separation from the stem and its\r\nassumption of the =H=-form. It is noteworthy, however, that this\r\ncomparison has acquired a greater significance as the result of recent\r\nwork. The stele of _Ankyropteris_ bears a fairly close resemblance to\r\nthat of _Zalesskya_ described by Kidston and Gwynne-Vaughan; in both\r\ntypes the xylem is represented by two kinds of tracheal tissue. In the\r\nPermian Osmundaceous genus the centre of the stele consists of short\r\nstorage tracheids, while in _Ankyropteris_ we may regard the central\r\nparenchyma and scattered tracheae as derivatives of the solid xylem\r\ncore of some ancestral type. Moreover, the appearance and arrangement\r\nof the phloem and the tangentially elongated elements external to it\r\n(fig. 314) remind one of the extra-xylem zone in recent Osmundaceae.\r\nThat the Osmundaceae and Zygoptereae are closely related groups\r\nthere can be little doubt; of this affinity and common origin[1173]\r\n_Ankyropteris corrugata_ affords striking evidence.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the steles of _Ankyropteris Grayi_ and _A.\r\nscandens_ (figs. 310, D; 311) and that of _Ankyropteris corrugata_ is\r\ncomparatively small. In the two former species the cylindrical form has\r\nbecome stellate owing to the radial extension of the xylem arms. It may\r\nbe that this more elaborate style of vascular construction is connected\r\nwith the climbing habit of _A. scandens_ and possibly _A. Grayi_. The\r\nradial extension of the xylem and the consequent alternation of the\r\nyielding parenchymatous cortex and the more rigid tracheal arms would\r\nprobably render the water-conducting elements less liable to injury in\r\na twisting axis[1174]. In _Anachoropteris Decaisnii_[1175], described\r\nby Renault, and more especially in _Asterochlaena laxa_[1176] Stenzel,\r\na Lower Permian type from Saxony (fig. 324), the xylem of the stele is\r\nmuch more deeply lobed than in _Ankyropteris Grayi_ or _A. scandens_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 318. _Etapteris Scotti_, P. Bert. (From Tansley,\r\n  after Renault.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Etapteris Scotti_. Figs. 308, B; 309, E; 318.\r\n\r\nP. Bertrand has proposed this name for a species of petiole from the\r\nLower Coal-Measures of England referred by Binney[1177] to _Zygopteris\r\nLacattii_ Ren., and included by Williamson[1178] in his comprehensive\r\ngenus _Rachiopteris_. Bertrand[1179] regards the English species,\r\nwhich is recorded also from Germany[1180], as distinct from Renault’s\r\ntype[1181] and therefore proposes a new name. The petiole stele has the\r\n=H=-form, but its structure is simpler than that of the _Ankyropteris_\r\npetiole.\r\n\r\nThe horizontal band of xylem has at each end two oval groups of\r\ntracheae connected with it by a single row of xylem elements (fig.\r\n318). From the lower part of each oval group a small strand is\r\ndetached; the two strands from one side of the stele coalesce and then\r\nseparate to pass into two pinnae. Fig. 308, B, shows four stages in the\r\ngiving-off of the secondary branches. This species, therefore, produces\r\nfour rows of branches in alternate pairs from the right and left sides\r\nof the petiole.\r\n\r\nThe first stage is shown at 0, 0, fig. 308, B; the two projecting\r\ngroups of protoxylem mark the points of departure of a pair of small\r\nstrands. At 1, the projections are more prominent, and at 2 a pair of\r\nstrands has become detached: at a later stage, 3, these two strands\r\nunite to divide later (4) into two slightly curved bundles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 319.\r\n\r\n  A–C. Sporangia of _Etapteris_ (?).\r\n  D–G. _Botryopteris forensis_. (After Renault.)]\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the fructification of _Etapteris_ is based on\r\nRenault’s account of sporangia, which he regarded as belonging to\r\n_Zygopteris_ (_Etapteris_) _Lacattii_. They have the form of elongated\r\nslightly curved sacs (2·5 × 1·3 mm.) borne in clusters (fig. 319, A–C)\r\non slender ramifications of the fertile frond, which is characterised\r\nby the absence of a lamina. Each sporangium has a pedicel, and three\r\nto eight sporangia are attached to a common peduncle; the walls of the\r\nsporangia are at least two cell-layers in thickness and the annulus\r\nconsists of a band of thick-walled cells passing from the crest down\r\neach side (figs. B and C), thus differing from the sporangia of\r\n_Botryopteris_ (fig. 319, D, F) in which the broad annulus is confined\r\nto one side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 320. _Stauropteris oldhamia_. (After Tansley. From\r\n  a section in Dr Scott’s Collection. × 60.)]\r\n\r\nIt is practically certain that the fronds described by Grand’Eury[1182]\r\nas _Schizopteris pinnata_ (fig. 309, E) and _Schizostachys frondosus_\r\nrepresent respectively the sterile and fertile leaves of _Etapteris_.\r\nZeiller[1183] gives expression to this by substituting the generic name\r\n_Zygopteris_ for _Schizopteris_, and we may now speak of the leaves as\r\n_Etapteris_. Dr White[1184] has referred to a new genus, _Brittsia_,\r\nsome impressions of pinnate fronds from the Coal-Measures of Missouri\r\nwhich, as he points out, bear a close resemblance to _Schizopteris\r\npinnata_ Grand’Eury (fig. 309, E). No sporangia have been found; it is,\r\nhowever, probable that _Brittsia problematica_ represents fragments of\r\na leaf borne by a plant closely allied to _Etapteris_ (_Zygopteris_).\r\nThe broad rachis bears crowded pinnae given off at a wide angle; the\r\nsmall pinnules are rather deeply lobed or pinnatifid (3–10 mm. long\r\nby 1·5–3 mm. broad). The lamina is traversed by irregularly lobed and\r\noccasionally anastomosing veins. In the fertile pinnae the segments\r\nhave no lamina but bear bundles of pedicellate sporangia.\r\n\r\nIt should be noticed that the sporangia described by Renault and by\r\nother authors as those of _Zygopteris_ (fig. 319, A–C) have not been\r\nfound in organic continuity with a frond showing a well-preserved\r\nvascular strand. It is, however, certain that this characteristic\r\nannulate sporangium, borne on branched and slender pedicels, was\r\nproduced on fronds with a much reduced lamina belonging to some species\r\nof the Zygoptereae, _Etapteris_ and probably also _Ankyropteris_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Stauropteris._\r\n\r\nThis genus was instituted by Binney for petioles from the Lower\r\nCoal-Measures of Oldham (Lancashire).\r\n\r\n_Stauropteris oldhamia_ Binney[1185] is characterised by a stele (figs.\r\n308, E–G; 310, C; 320; 321) composed of four groups of xylem which\r\nBertrand regards as homologous with the antennae of _Diplolabis_,\r\n_Ankyropteris_, and _Etapteris_, the horizontal cross-piece of\r\nthese genera being absent in _Stauropteris_. Williamson spoke of\r\nthis species as “one of the most beautiful and also one of the most\r\nperplexing of the plants of the Coal-Measures”; he discussed its\r\npossible affinity with both Lycopods and ferns, deciding in favour of\r\nthe latter group[1186]. In transverse section the petiolar vascular\r\naxis is approximately square, the xylem groups forming the ends of the\r\ndiagonals; the tracheal groups are separated by phloem and the centre\r\nof the stele in the primary rachis is also occupied by that tissue,\r\nwhich is connected by four narrow strips with the external phloem. The\r\nstructure of the petiolar vascular axis is very clearly shown in the\r\ndrawing by Mrs Tansley reproduced in fig. 320. Protoxylem elements\r\noccur close to the surface of each of the four arms of the xylem; the\r\nbays between the two lateral and the two lower xylem groups contain\r\nlarge sieve-tubes. Portions of the inner cortex are seen in places\r\nabutting on the small-celled pericyclic tissue.\r\n\r\nThe right and left halves of the stele are not absolutely identical\r\n(fig. 320; fig. 308, E); this is due to the fact that secondary\r\nbranches are given off in four rows, two alternately from the right and\r\nleft sides. The preparation for the departure of the lateral strands\r\nalters the configuration of the stelar xylem groups. The protoxylem\r\ngroups are not external but separated from the surface by one or two\r\nlayers of metaxylem. In fig. 308, E, the occurrence of two protoxylem\r\nstrands in the right-hand groups of metaxylem marks an early stage in\r\nthe detachment of branches. These two protoxylems are the result of\r\ndivision of single protoxylem strands like those in the left-hand half\r\nof the stele. At a later stage the petiolar stele assumes the form\r\nshown in fig. 308, F, and two small bundles are detached to supply\r\naphlebiae: this is followed by the stage shown in fig. G, where two\r\nfour-armed strands are passing out to a pair of branches of the leaf\r\naxis. The separation of these two meristeles leaves the right-hand half\r\nof the stele in the condition seen on the left-hand side of fig. E.\r\nThe diagrammatic sketch represented in fig. 310, C, shows one pair of\r\nbranches in organic connexion with the rachis, and each of these arms\r\ncontains an obliquely cut vascular strand like those in fig. 308, G.\r\n\r\nThe cortex consists for the most part of fairly thick-walled parenchyma\r\n(fig. 321) which in the hypodermal region is replaced by a zone of\r\nthin-walled lacunar tissue. A few stomata have been recognised in the\r\nepidermis[1187]. The lower left-hand branch seen in fig. 310, C, has\r\nbeen shaved by the cutting wheel so that the aerenchymatous tissue,\r\n_l_, is shown in surface-view: a portion of this tissue is enlarged in\r\nfig. C′. The same delicate chlorophyllous tissue forms a folded and\r\nshrivelled layer with an uneven margin on the surface of the rachis\r\nand lateral branches. This hypha-like tissue, which was discovered by\r\nScott[1188] and figured by Bertrand[1189], doubtless represents the\r\nmuch reduced lamina of the highly compound leaves; it may be compared\r\nwith the green outer cortex of _Psilotum_ shoots and with the lacunar\r\ntissue in the capsule of the common moss, _Funaria hygrometrica_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 321. _Stauropteris oldhamia_: _a_, sections of\r\n  pinnae. (× 10. From a section in the Cambridge Botany School Coll.)]\r\n\r\nThe rachis reproduced in fig. 321 is surrounded by an enormous\r\nnumber of sections, some transverse, others more or less vertical,\r\nof branchlets of various sizes. Fig. 310, B, shows the three-rayed\r\nvascular axis of a branch of a lower order than those seen in fig. C,\r\nand the single vascular strands of still finer ramifications of the\r\nleaf. The extraordinary abundance of axes of different sizes, many of\r\nwhich are cut in the plane of branching, in close association with the\r\nrachises of _Stauropteris_ affords a striking demonstration of the\r\nextent to which the subdivision of the frond was carried in a small\r\nspace. The leaves must have presented the appearance of a feathery\r\nplexus of delicate green branchlets devoid of a lamina, some of which\r\nbore terminal sporangia. It may be that the delicate fronds were borne\r\non a slender rhizome which lived epiphytically in a moist atmosphere on\r\nthe stouter stems of a supporting plant.\r\n\r\nThe sporangia[1190] of _Stauropteris oldhamia_ are exannulate and\r\nnearly spherical, with a wall of more than a single row of cells;\r\nthey occur at the tips of slender and doubtless pendulous branchlets.\r\nThe discovery by Scott[1191] of germinating spores (fig. 323) in a\r\nsporangium of this type supplies an interesting piece of evidence\r\nin favour of the fern nature of these reproductive organs. Similar\r\ngerminating spores have been described by Boodle[1192] in sporangia of\r\n_Todea_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 322. Sporangia of _Stauropteris oldhamia_. _St_,\r\n  stomium: _p_, palisade tissue. (From Tansley, after D. H. Scott,\r\n  from a drawing by Mrs D. H. Scott.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stauropteris burntislandica._\r\n\r\nThis Lower Carboniferous plant identified by Williamson with the\r\nOldham plant from the Lower Coal-Measures is referred by Bertrand to\r\na distinct species. In the structure of the rachis stele it agrees\r\nclosely with _Stauropteris oldhamia_; the main vascular strand gives\r\noff four rows of branches, two from each side, and aphlebiae were\r\npresent at the common base of each pair of pinnae. Mrs Scott[1193],\r\nwho has recently described the sporangia of this species, speaks of\r\none specimen in which germinating spores were found. The same author\r\ngives an account of some curious spindle-shaped bodies which she found\r\nin association with _S. burntislandica_. The nature of these organs\r\nis uncertain; Mrs Scott inclines to regard them as glands borne in\r\npairs on lateral pedicels of the frond: she adopts for these the name\r\n_Bensonites fusiformis_ proposed by Dr Scott. If there is a reasonable\r\nprobability, as there certainly seems to be, in favour of connecting\r\nthese organs with _Stauropteris_, it is legitimate to question the\r\ndesirability of adding to the long list of names included in the group\r\nCoenopterideae.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 323. Germinating spores from a sporangium of\r\n  _Stauropteris_. (From Tansley, after D. H. Scott.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Corynepteris._ Fig. 309, C, D.\r\n\r\nThis genus was founded by Baily[1194] on fragments of a fern from\r\nCarboniferous rocks in County Limerick, Ireland, characterised by a\r\npeculiar type of fructification which he named _Corynepteris stellata_.\r\nMore complete examples of the same genus have been described by\r\nZeiller[1195] from the Coal-field of Valenciennes. The sporangia are\r\nlarge, ovoid, and sessile; the annulus (fig. 309, D) has the form of a\r\ncomplete vertical band several cells in breadth: five to ten sporangia\r\nare grouped round a receptacle. Zeiller describes two species as\r\n_Sphenopteris (Corynepteris) coralloides_ Gutb. and _S. (Corynepteris)\r\nEssinghii_ And.; in both the fronds are quadripinnate and bear\r\naphlebiae at the base of the pinnae. The former species is recorded\r\nby Kidston[1196] from the South Wales Coal-field. A single pinnule of\r\n_C. coralloides_ is shown in fig. 309, C. Potonié[1197] refers this\r\nfrond to his genus _Alloiopteris_: the portion of a pinna represented\r\nin fig. 354, G shows the characteristic modified pinnule next the\r\nrachis. Zeiller draws attention to the occurrence of two parallel\r\nlines on the rachis of a specimen of _Corynepteris coralloides_ which\r\nhe figures[1198], and suggests that these may indicate the existence\r\nof an =H=-shaped form of vascular strand like that of _Etapteris_ and\r\n_Ankyropteris_. The sorus of _Corynepteris_ is comparable with that of\r\nthe Marattiaceae, but the broad annulus is a difference which suggests\r\naffinity to _Etapteris_. The sorus is similar to that in _Diplolabis_\r\n(fig. 309, A), but in that genus the sporangia are exannulate.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nThe vascular axis in the stems of different members of the\r\nCoenopterideae assumes a variety of types. In _Botryopteris antiqua_\r\nthe xylem forms a solid protostele in which no protoxylem strands have\r\nbeen recognised; in other species, e.g. _B. ramosa_, the cylindrical\r\nstele is similar to that of _Trichomanes radicans_ (Hymenophyllaceae)\r\nin the more or less central position of the protoxylem. In\r\n_Botryopteris forensis_ the protostele is said to be exarch. The\r\nprobability is that the central Botryopteris type is the endarch\r\nprotostele, a form of vascular axis which may be regarded as primitive.\r\nThe leaf-traces of the Lower Carboniferous _Botryopteris antiqua_ are\r\nsimple oval strands differing but slightly from the cylindrical stele\r\nof the stem. In the Upper Carboniferous British species the petiolar\r\nvascular strand has become more specialised and farther removed from\r\nthat of the stem; in _B. forensis_ the distinction between leaf\r\nand stem steles is still more pronounced. It is perhaps legitimate\r\nto regard these types as representing an ascending series, the more\r\nprimitive of which are distinguished by the greater similarity between\r\nleaf and stem, organs differentiated from a primitive thallus[1199],\r\nthat is from a vegetative body. Portions of this ultimately became\r\nspecialised as lateral members or leaves, while a portion acquired the\r\ncharacter of a radially constructed supporting axis or stem.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ANKYROPTERIS, ETC.]\r\n\r\nThe vascular strand characteristic of the Zygoptereae is represented\r\nby the =H=-shaped form as seen in _Ankyropteris corrugata_ or in a\r\nmore complex form in _A. bibractensis_. This style of strand may be\r\nregarded as a development from the simple strands of _Grammatopteris_\r\nand _Tubicaulis_ or _Botryopteris antiqua_ along other lines than\r\nthose followed by _B. forensis_. The extension of the xylem in two\r\nsymmetrically placed arms at the ends of the cross-piece of the =H=\r\nis correlated with the habit of branching of the leaf-system which\r\nforms one of the striking peculiarities of many of the Zygoptereae.\r\nThe solid type of stele characteristic of the Botryoptereae is closely\r\nmatched by that in the Lower Carboniferous stem discovered by Mr\r\nGordon[1200]. By the partial transformation of the central xylem region\r\ninto parenchymatous tissue and the concentration of water-conducting\r\nelements in the peripheral region the style of _Ankyropteris corrugata_\r\nwas developed. The vascular strand of the older plant, which is of\r\nthe _Diplolabis_ type, may be regarded as a more primitive style than\r\nthat of the =H=-form of petiole strand represented by _Ankyropteris\r\ncorrugata_. A further stage in evolution is seen in the stem stele\r\nof _Ankyropteris Grayi_ and _A. scandens_, both of which have the\r\n=H=-form of meristele. This step in increasing complexity of stem\r\nstele, though probably connected with the increasing specialisation of\r\nthe leaf-traces, as held by Mr Tansley, may also be associated with the\r\ndevelopment of a climbing habit. In _Asterochlaena laxa_ Stenzel (fig.\r\n324) and _A. ramosa_ (Cotta)[1201] the tendency towards a stellate\r\nexpansion of the originally cylindrical form of stele reaches a higher\r\ndegree, with the result that a style is evolved which agrees closely\r\nwith that of the conducting tissue of some existing Dicotyledonous\r\nLianes.\r\n\r\nAttention has already been drawn to the generalised features exhibited\r\nby the Coenopterideae both in the anatomy of the steles and in the\r\nstructure of the sporangia. The conclusion arrived at is that while\r\nthe Coenopterideae foreshadow in some of their characters more than\r\none group of more recent ferns, some at least of their members afford\r\nconvincing evidence of the correctness of the view—which is also that\r\nof Dr Kidston and Mr Gwynne-Vaughan—that the Osmundaceae and the\r\nCoenopterideae are offshoots of a common stock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 324. _Asterochlaena laxa_: part of stem with\r\n  petiole and a few roots.

Lindman[1202] has however founded a third genus,\r\n_Regnellidium_, on a Brazilian plant which is distinguished by some\r\nwell-defined characters from all species of _Marsilia_. The members\r\nof the Marsiliaceae live for the most part in swampy situations.\r\n_Marsilia_ is represented in Europe by _M. quadrifoliata_ L. which\r\noccurs in Portugal, France, Germany and other parts of the Continent,\r\nextending also to Kashmir, Northern China, and Japan. Of the other 53\r\nspecies, 17 are recorded from different regions in Africa, while others\r\noccur in South America, Asia[1203], Australia, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n_Pilularia globulifera_ L. is the only British representative of the\r\nHydropterideae. The remaining four species of the genus occur in South\r\nAmerica, California, New Zealand, Australia, and _P. minuta_ Dur. is\r\nmet with in the South of France, Algeria, and Asia Minor in subtropical\r\nor warm temperate regions.\r\n\r\nThe Marsiliaceae are regarded as more nearly related to the\r\nSchizaeaceae than to any other family of homosporous ferns[1204].\r\nTheir heterospory, the production of sporangia in closed fruit-like\r\nsporocarps, and the anatomical features associated with existence in\r\nmarshy habitats, tend to obscure the resemblances to the true ferns.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nThe genus _Marsilidium_ proposed by Schenk[1205] for a piece of an\r\naxis, bearing apparently a whorl of six leaflets, from the Wealden of\r\nOsterwald, cannot be regarded as satisfactory evidence of the existence\r\nof the Marsiliaceae in the Wealden flora of North Germany.\r\n\r\nThe six leaflets of _Marsilidium speciosum_, having a length of 5\r\ncm., are similar in shape to the four leaflets of recent species of\r\n_Marsilia_, but they differ in the repeated dichotomy of the veins from\r\nthe reticulate venation of the recent forms. It is worthy of note,\r\nhowever, that in Lindman’s Brazilian type _Regnellidium diphyllum_\r\n(fig. 326, A), the leaflets are characterised by dichotomous and not by\r\nanastomosing veins.\r\n\r\nHollick[1206] has described some impressions of imperfect orbicular\r\nleaves with a “finely flabellate obscurely reticulated(?) venation”\r\nfrom Cretaceous rocks of Long Island as _Marsilia Andersoni_, but\r\nthese are too fragmentary to be accorded this generic designation. My\r\nfriend Dr Krasser informs me that he is describing some well-preserved\r\nleaves from Cretaceous beds of Grünbach in Lower Austria as _Marsilia\r\nNathorsti_[1207]. He compares these with the recent form _Marsilia\r\nelata_, a variety of _M. Drummondi_.\r\n\r\nAnother Lower Cretaceous species _Marsilia perucensis_ has been figured\r\nby Frič and Bayer[1208] as a stalked fruit-like body from Bohemia. This\r\nwas originally described by Velenovský as _M. cretacea_, but under\r\nthis name Heer[1209] had previously recorded a supposed sporocarp from\r\nGreenland. These fossils have little claim to recognition as examples\r\nof Marsiliaceous plants.\r\n\r\nThe fragment figured by Heer[1210] from Tertiary rocks of Oeningen\r\nas _Pilularia pedunculata_ is too small to determine with reasonable\r\naccuracy. Other supposed representatives of the family mentioned in\r\npalaeobotanical literature are not of sufficient importance to describe.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Salviniaceae.\r\n\r\nThe two genera of Salviniaceae, _Salvinia_ and _Azolla_, are water\r\nplants, and are usually described as annuals which survive the less\r\nfavourable season in the form of detached sporocarps. Goebel[1211]\r\nstates that all the tropical species of _Salvinia_ known to him have an\r\nunlimited existence.\r\n\r\n_Salvinia natans_, Hoffm., the only European species, extends from the\r\nSouth of France to Northern China and the plains of India: the other\r\ntwelve species are mostly tropical. _Azolla_, represented by four\r\nspecies, occurs in Western and Southern North America, South America,\r\nMadagascar, Australia, New Zealand, and is widely spread in tropical\r\nAsia and Africa.\r\n\r\nSpecies of _Azolla_ frequently form a considerable proportion of the\r\nfloating carpet of vegetation on inland waters[1212] growing under\r\nconditions which might be supposed favourable for preservation in a\r\nfossil state.\r\n\r\nThe Salviniaceae, though probably rather farther removed than the\r\nMarsiliaceae from the homosporous Filicineae, are considered by\r\nBower[1213] to be related to the Gradatae, but modified in consequence\r\nof their aquatic habit and the assumption of heterospory.\r\n\r\nNo undoubted examples of fossil species of _Azolla_ have been\r\ndescribed. _Salvinia_, on the other hand, is represented by several\r\nTertiary species, for the most part founded on leaves only, and\r\nHollick[1214], who published a list of fossil Salvinias, has described\r\ndetached leaves as _Salvinia elliptica_ Newb. from what may be Upper\r\nCretaceous rocks from Carbonado, Washington. Some of the leaves\r\nfigured as Tertiary Salvinias are of no value as evidence of the former\r\ndistribution of the genus[1215].\r\n\r\nFrom the Coal-beds of Yen-Bäi (Tonkin), probably of Miocene age,\r\nZeiller[1216] has figured some well-preserved impressions of oval or\r\norbicular leaves, 15 mm. long and 10–20 mm. broad, characterised by\r\nreticulate venation and by cordate bases, which he refers to Heer’s\r\nSwiss species _Salvinia formosa_[1217].\r\n\r\nDr Zeiller[1218] in the most recently published part of his series of\r\nvaluable résumés of palaeobotanical literature refers to a description\r\nby Brabenec of specimens of this species from Bohemian Tertiary beds\r\nshowing both microspores and megaspores.\r\n\r\nOne of the most complete specimens so far discovered has recently\r\nbeen described by Fritel[1219] from Eocene beds of the Paris Basin\r\nas _Salvinia Zeilleri_. This species, founded on portions of stems\r\nbearing floating leaves, submerged root-like leaves, and sporocarps, is\r\ncompared with a recent tropical American species _S. auriculata_.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that no authentic records of Hydropterideae have been\r\ndiscovered in Palaeozoic rocks[1220]. Comparisons have been made in\r\nthe case of the genera _Traquairia_ Carr. and _Sporocarpon_ Will. with\r\nthe reproductive organs of _Azolla_[1221], but these rest on a wholly\r\ninsufficient basis.\r\n\r\nDawson[1222] proposed the generic name _Protosalvinia_ for some spores\r\nof Devonian age, which he regarded on inadequate grounds as evidence of\r\nPalaeozoic Hydropterideae.\r\n\r\nZeiller[1223], in discussing the possible relationships of the\r\nproblematical type _Chorionopteris gleichenioides_ Cord., suggests a\r\npossible alliance with the Hydropterideae. Corda founded the genus\r\n_Chorionopteris_[1224] on some small fragments of pinnules, 6–7 mm.\r\nlong, found in the Carboniferous rocks of Radnitz in Bohemia.\r\n\r\nThe lobes of the pinnules are incurved distally to form a capsule,\r\ncontaining four sporangia, which apparently opened on dehiscence into\r\nfour valves; the spores are of one size. The material is however\r\ninsufficient for accurate determination.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence contributed by fossil records which indicates\r\na high antiquity for the Hydropterideae. It is unsafe to base any\r\nconclusion on the absence of undoubted Palaeozoic representatives of\r\nthis group; but the almost complete absence of records in pre-Tertiary\r\nstrata is a fact which may be allowed some weight in regard to the\r\npossible evolution of the heterosporous filicales at a comparatively\r\nlate period in the earth’s history.\r\n\r\nA description of the Mesozoic genus _Sagenopteris_ may be conveniently\r\nincluded in this chapter, though as in many other instances the\r\ninclusion of a genus under the heading of a recent family name does not\r\nby any means imply that the position of the extinct type is regarded as\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Sagenopteris.\r\n\r\nThis generic name was applied by Presl[1225] to small fronds composed\r\nof four or rarely two palmately disposed leaflets with a more or less\r\ndistinct midrib and anastomosing secondary veins. Schimper[1226]\r\ncompared _Sagenopteris_ with _Marsilia_, but did not regard the\r\nresemblance as evidence of relationship. Nathorst[1227] expressed\r\nthe opinion that certain fruit-like bodies obtained from the Rhaetic\r\nbeds of Scania are of the nature of sporocarps and were borne by\r\n_Sagenopteris_, with the leaves of which they were associated. He\r\npublished a drawing of part of a fruit showing on its partially\r\nflattened surface some raised oval bodies which are considered to\r\nbe spores. Dr Nathorst kindly placed at my disposal the drawings\r\nreproduced in fig. 325 made from some of his specimens found at Bjuf in\r\nScania.\r\n\r\nIn contour and superficial features, e.g. the veining on the wall,\r\nthese bodies bear a fairly close resemblance to the sporocarps of\r\nrecent species of _Marsilia_. They were found in association with\r\nthe leaves of _Sagenopteris undulata_ Nath., an abundant Scania type\r\nsimilar in form to the English Jurassic species _S. Phillipsi_ (figs.\r\n327, 328). Heer was independently led by an examination of some\r\nexamples of the Swedish “fruits” to compare them with the sporocarps\r\nof _Marsilia_. A small spherical body is figured by Zigno[1228] close\r\nto a leaf of his species _S. angustifolia_, which may be a sporocarp.\r\nIn a recent paper, Salfeld[1229] says that he found fructification\r\non the lower face of the leaflets of _S. Nilssoniana_ Brongn. from\r\nGerman Jurassic rocks, but he brings forward no evidence in support\r\nof this statement. The systematic position of _Sagenopteris_ is by\r\nno means settled. In a previous account of the genus I expressed the\r\nview that it is probably a member of the true ferns[1230], but the\r\nresemblance of Dr Nathorst’s drawings to the Marsilian sporocarps\r\ninfluences me in favour of his opinion that _Sagenopteris_ may belong\r\nto the Hydropterideae. The evidence, as Solms-Laubach[1231] states,\r\nis not wholly satisfactory: Schenk points out that the frequent\r\noccurrence of detached _Sagenopteris_ leaflets suggests that they\r\neasily fell off the petiole, whereas in _Marsilia_ the leaflets do not\r\nfall off independently. The discovery of a new type of Marsiliaceae in\r\nBrazil, which Lindman has described as _Regnellidium diphyllum_[1232]\r\n(fig. 326, A), affords an additional piece of evidence bearing on\r\nthe comparison of _Sagenopteris_ with members of this family. In\r\n_Regnellidium_ the leaves differ from those of _Marsilia_ in bearing\r\ntwo instead of four leaflets, and in the former the veins are\r\nrepeatedly forked, and do not anastomose as in _Marsilia_. In the\r\npossession of only two leaflets _Regnellidium_ agrees with some forms\r\nof _Sagenopteris_ (fig. 328).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 325.

In others a shorter winged petiole bears one\r\n  or two shorter and broader, somewhat obcuneate, leaflets without a\r\n  midrib.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Bunbury[1235] was correct in his opinion that the\r\nspecimen figured by Lindley and Hutton[1236] as _Otopteris cuneata_,\r\ncharacterised by two leaflets (fig. 328), is not specifically distinct\r\nfrom the normal form with four leaflets (fig. 327).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, such specimens as that represented in Pl. XVIII., fig.\r\n3 of the first part of my _Jurassic Flora_, in which a short stalk\r\nbears only one leaflet may, provisionally at least, be included in\r\nBrongniart’s species. Yabe[1237] describes a form with two leaflets\r\nfrom Jurassic rocks of Korea as _Sagenopteris bilobata_ which resembles\r\n_S. Phillipsi_; and Moeller[1238] records a specimen similar to that\r\nrepresented in fig. 328 from Bornholm as _S. cuneata_ (Lind. and Hutt.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 328. _Sagenopteris Phillipsi._ From a specimen in\r\n  the Manchester University Museum. Nat. size.]\r\n\r\nThe leaf shown in fig. 327, A, in which the longest segments are 4·5\r\ncm. in length, represents the most abundant form and illustrates the\r\nvery close agreement between _S. Phillipsi_ and the Rhaetic species\r\n_S. rhoifolia_. Fig. 327, B, which is drawn from a specimen figured by\r\nLindley and Hutton[1239], shows a leaf with longer (6·5 cm.) and much\r\nnarrower segments. Broader leaflets are occasionally met with in which\r\nthe lamina reaches a length of 11 cm.[1240]\r\n\r\nLeaves with leaflets narrower (3 mm. broad) than those represented in\r\nfig. 327, B, are described by Zigno[1241] from Jurassic beds of Italy\r\nas _S. angustifolia_ and by Moeller[1242] from the Jurassic of Bornholm\r\nas _S. Phillipsi_ f. _pusilla_. A coarser type of venation than that of\r\n_S. Phillipsi_ is occasionally found in Jurassic examples, as in _S.\r\ngrandifolia_ Font.[1243] from Oregon and _S. Nathorsti_ Barth. from\r\nBornholm[1244].\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\n_Sagenopteris_ is recorded also from several Rhaetic floras. The best\r\nknown species, _S. rhoifolia_ Presl[1245], is hardly distinguishable\r\nfrom some forms of _S. Phillipsi_ or from the Italian Jurassic species\r\ndescribed by Zigno as _S. Goeppertiana_[1246], though the leaflets are\r\nusually rather larger. This species was first described by Brongniart\r\nas _Filicites Nilssoniana_[1247], and a few authors[1248] have adopted\r\nthis specific name because of its priority over Presl’s designation.\r\nAs Nathorst remarks, to give up the well-known name _S. rhoifolia_ for\r\n_S. Nilssoniana_ is “mere pedantry.” The epidermis of _S. rhoifolia_\r\nas figured by Schenk[1249] consists of cells with straight and not\r\nundulating walls: stomata occur on the lower surface (fig. 326, B).\r\n\r\nRhaetic leaves of the type represented by _S. rhoifolia_ have a wide\r\ngeographical distribution.\r\n\r\nThe specimens described by Feistmantel from the Damuda series of India\r\nas _Sagenopteris longifolia_ are no doubt fronds of _Glossopteris\r\nlongifolia_[1250].\r\n\r\nThe Wealden species _Sagenopteris Mantelli_ (Dunk.)[1251] agrees\r\nclosely in habit and in the form of the leaflets with _S. Phillipsi_\r\nand _S. rhoifolia_. It is probable that some of the leaves described by\r\nVelenovský[1252] from Lower Cretaceous rocks in Bohemia as _Thinnfeldia\r\nvariabilis_ are portions of _Sagenopteris_ fronds. _S. Mantelli_ is\r\nrecorded from several European localities, from California[1253], and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n_Sagenopteris_ appears to have been widely distributed during\r\nthe Rhaetic, Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous floras. The very great\r\nsimilarity between the specimens recorded from these three formations\r\nrenders the genus an uncertain guide in regard to geological age.\r\nDecisive evidence as to its position in the plant kingdom is at present\r\nlacking: the inclusion of the genus as a possible member of the\r\nHydropterideae has still to be justified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n             GENERA OF PTERIDOSPERMS, FERNS, AND _PLANTAE\r\n                           INCERTAE SEDIS._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe genera and species described in this Chapter are founded on\r\nsterile leaves or portions of leaves, and in the great majority of\r\ncases the reproductive organs are either imperfectly known or have\r\nstill to be discovered. Some of the genera, the smaller number, are\r\nno doubt true ferns, while most of them may safely be regarded as\r\nplants which will ultimately be shown to belong to some other group,\r\nin most cases that of the Pteridosperms. It is possible that a few\r\nof the types may be members of the Cycadophyta rather than of the\r\nPteridospermeae, but evidence as to systematic position is for the\r\nmost part of a negative kind or too incomplete to lead to any definite\r\nexpression of opinion as to the cycadean or pteridosperm nature of the\r\nimperfectly known Palaeozoic or Mesozoic species. Many of the genera\r\nare of little botanical interest, though even the most problematical\r\nare of importance as criteria of geological age. Genera which there\r\nis good reason for including in the Pteridosperms are dealt with in\r\nthis section, in order that the Chapter in Volume III. devoted to this\r\nimportant group may be limited to more completely known types.\r\n\r\nIn most text-books it is customary to employ family names for sterile\r\nfern-like fronds which possess similar venation features or have\r\nin common certain vegetative characters, the value of which it is\r\nimpossible to estimate. In the following account family or group\r\nnames are not adopted, on the ground that such slight utility as\r\nthey may have is more than counterbalanced by the risk attending a\r\ngrouping under one name of plants which may agree only in unessential\r\ncharacters. The practice of classifying fossil plants has been carried\r\nto excess. Grouping together genera as a matter of convenience\r\nunavoidably creates a prejudice in favour of actual relationship, which\r\nmay or may not exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Taeniopteris.\r\n\r\nThis generic name was instituted by Brongniart[1254] for simple\r\nlinear or broadly linear leaves with a prominent midrib from which\r\nsecondary veins, simple or dichotomously branched, are given off at\r\nright angles or obliquely. The frond of the type-species _Taeniopteris\r\nvittata_ (fig. 332), characteristic of Jurassic floras, was compared\r\nby Brongniart with the pinnules of _Danaea_ and _Angiopteris_. Among\r\nrecent ferns the Taeniopteris form of frond and venation is represented\r\nby _Oleandra neriiformis_, _Asplenium nidus_, and many other species.\r\nThough usually applied to fronds which there is good reason for\r\nregarding as simple leaves, the generic designation _Taeniopteris_ has\r\nbeen extended to include pinnate fronds, e.g. the Upper Palaeozoic\r\nspecies _T. jejunata_ Grand’Eury, and _T. Carnoti_ Ren. and Zeill.\r\n(fig. 330, A). The compound fronds from the Lower Coal-Measures\r\nof Missouri described by Dr White[1255] as _T. missouriensis_ are\r\ncharacterised by decurrent and confluent Taeniopteroid pinnules. In a\r\nlater reference[1256] to this plant White pertinently adds, “perhaps it\r\nbelongs more properly in _Alethopteris_.”\r\n\r\nLeaves of the _Taeniopteris_ type are described by several authors as\r\nspecies of _Oleandridium_, _Angiopteridium_, _Danaeites_, _Marattia_,\r\nand other genera. In such species of Taeniopteroid leaves as have\r\nbeen dealt with in a former Chapter, the occurrence of sori justifies\r\nthe substitution of a name denoting a close relationship to existing\r\nmembers of the Marattiaceae, but in the absence of fertile specimens\r\nthe provisional designation _Taeniopteris_ should be retained. It\r\nis often difficult to decide between _Taeniopteris_ and _Nilssonia_\r\nas the more suitable name to apply to fragments of fossil leaves\r\nof Mesozoic age. _Taeniopteris_ is, however, distinguished from the\r\nCycadean genus by the greater prominence of the rachis, also by the\r\ndichotomous branching of the secondary veins, usually close to their\r\norigin and at varying distances between the axis of the frond and the\r\nedge of the lamina. The genus _Taeniopteris_, though most abundant in\r\nRhaetic and Jurassic strata, occurs also in Upper Carboniferous and\r\nLower Permian rocks. The generic name _Macrotaeniopteris_ instituted by\r\nSchimper[1257] has been used for leaves differing only in size from the\r\nusual type of _Taeniopteris_, but there is no adequate reason for its\r\nretention.\r\n\r\nThe species included in _Taeniopteris_ afford no satisfactory evidence\r\nas to their systematic position. It is obviously unwise to adopt such\r\ngeneric titles as _Oleandridium_, _Marattiopsis_, etc., merely because\r\nof resemblance in the venation of sterile fragments to _Oleandra_ or\r\nMarattiaceous ferns.\r\n\r\nSome specimens of _Taeniopteris_ fronds described by Mr Sellards[1258]\r\nfrom Permian rocks of Kansas, which are referred to later, have\r\nfurnished unconvincing evidence of reproductive organs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Taeniopteris multinervis_, Weiss. Fig. 329, A, B.\r\n\r\nThe late Dr Weiss[1259] instituted this species (which he designated\r\n_Taeniopteris multinervia_, though the specific name _multinervis_\r\nis constantly used) for a fragment of a leaf from the Lower Permian\r\nof Lebach characterised by numerous forked veins given off at right\r\nangles from a prominent rachis (fig. 329, B). This type of frond is\r\nrecorded from the Permian of Trienbach (Alsace) by Zeiller[1260], by\r\nRenault[1261] and Zeiller[1262] from the Upper Carboniferous of Autun,\r\nand from other localities. The lamina of the simple leaf reaches a\r\nbreadth of 6 cm. and a length of 40 cm. (fig. 329, A); the numerous\r\nsecondary veins (25–36 per cm. of lamina) are either at right angles\r\nto the rachis or given off at an acute angle. The mesophyll consists\r\nof polygonal cells some of which are elongated at right angles to the\r\nsurface of the lamina. A very similar form is described by Fontaine and\r\nWhite from the Permian of Virginia as _T. Lescuriana_[1263].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 329.\r\n\r\n  A. _Taeniopteris multinervis_, Weiss. (⅚ nat. size. After Zeiller.)\r\n  B. _T. multinervis._ (Enlarged. After Zeiller.)\r\n  C. _Lesleya Delafondi._ (× 2. After Zeiller.)]\r\n\r\nIt is futile to expect to be able to separate the numerous\r\n_Taeniopteris_ leaves into well-defined species: all we can do is\r\nto group the specimens under different names, using as artificial\r\ndistinctions such characters as the shape of the leaf, the number\r\nof veins per centimetre, and the prominence of the rachis.\r\nAnother Virginian species of Permian age described by Fontaine\r\nand White[1264], _T. Newberriana_, is said to bear sori, but no\r\nsatisfactory information is given as to the nature of these organs.\r\nSpecimens referred with some hesitation to this species and to a\r\nsimilar species, _T. coriacea_, have been described by Sellards[1265]\r\nfrom material obtained from Permian beds in Kansas. The lamina of the\r\nsimple linear fronds is characterised by the occurrence of small oval\r\nbodies half immersed in the substance of the leaf between the secondary\r\nveins (figs. 330, D, E). One of these bodies is represented in an\r\napparently dehisced condition in fig. 330, D. Sellards suggests the\r\npossibility that these bodies are sporangia, but, as he points out,\r\nthey afford no indication of cellular structure nor are they in direct\r\nconnexion with the veins.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Taeniopteris jejunata_, Grand’Eury[1266].\r\n\r\nThis species differs from _T. multinervis_ in its bipinnate fronds;\r\nthe linear or oval-linear pinnae are attached by a short stalk to\r\nthe primary rachis and reach a length of 25 cm.; the veins are less\r\ncrowded, 12–15 per centimetre.\r\n\r\n_T. jejunata_ is recorded from the Coal-fields of the Loire and\r\nCommentry[1267] in France, from the Lower Permian of Thuringia[1268],\r\nand elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Taeniopteris Carnoti_, Ren. and Zeiller[1269]. Fig. 330, A.\r\n\r\nThis species, founded on portions of pinnate fronds from the Coal-field\r\nof Commentry, is characterised by rather broader (25–30 mm.) pinnules,\r\nwith short pedicels and a cordate base, reaching a length of 25–30 cm.\r\nThe secondary forked veins are more numerous than in _T. jejunata_. In\r\n_T. multinervis_ the pinnules are still broader and have a stronger\r\nmidrib.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nSeveral species of _Taeniopteris_ have been described from\r\nTriasso-Rhaetic rocks in Europe, India, Tonkin and elsewhere. In\r\nsome cases it is practically impossible to recognise clear specific\r\ndistinctions between Rhaetic and Jurassic types.\r\n\r\nFrom the Damuda and Panchet series of India (Triasso-Rhaetic)\r\nFeistmantel has described large sterile fronds as _Macrotaeniopteris\r\nFeddeni_[1270] which reach a breadth of 20 cm.: these may be compared\r\nwith the Indian species _Taeniopteris lata_ Oldham[1271], and to _T.\r\ngigantea_ from the Rhaetic of Franconia[1272] and Scania. A specimen\r\nof this species figured by Nathorst[1273] from Scania has a lamina 33\r\ncm. broad. Other examples are afforded by _M. Wianamattae_ Feist.[1274]\r\nfrom rocks of the same age in Australia and by _Taeniopteris superba_\r\nSap.[1275] from Lower Rhaetic rocks near Autun.\r\n\r\nFrom the Rhaetic of Tonkin, Zeiller records several species, among\r\nwhich may be mentioned _T. Jourdyi_ Zeill.[1276] and _T. spatulata_\r\nMacClelland (fig. 330, B, C). Both have simple fronds. Those of _T.\r\nJourdyi_ reach a length of 10–40 cm. and a breadth of 10–70 mm.; the\r\nrachis is characterised by crowded and discontinuous transverse folds,\r\nand the secondary veins (35–50 per cm.) are usually at right angles\r\nto the rachis. This Tonkin species is compared by Zeiller with the\r\nEuropean Rhaetic species _T. tenuinervis_ Brauns.\r\n\r\nThe polymorphism of the fronds is a striking feature: in one\r\ncase described by Zeiller the lamina appears to be divided into\r\nsegments like those characteristic of the leaf of the Cycadean\r\ngenus _Anomozamites_. It is obviously difficult in many instances\r\nto distinguish between detached Taeniopteroid pinnae of a compound\r\nfrond and complete simple leaves. In some compound fern fronds, as\r\nin the recent Polypodiaceous genus _Didymochlaena_, the pinnules are\r\ndeciduous, and the same feature undoubtedly characterised the fronds of\r\nmany extinct species. A specimen figured by Zeiller which shows several\r\npetioles of _T. Jourdyi_ attached to a thick stem[1277] demonstrates\r\nthe simple nature of the leaves. In other cases, e.g. _T. vittata_,\r\nspecimens occur in which the slightly enlarged petiole-base has a\r\nclean-cut surface indicating abscission from a rhizome (fig. 332).\r\n\r\nThe fronds described by Zeiller as _T. spatulata_[1278] (fig. 330,\r\nB, C) closely resemble Jurassic leaves from Victoria referred to\r\n_Taeniopteris Daintreei_ McCoy[1279].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 330.\r\n\r\n  A. _Taeniopteris Carnoti_, Ren. and Zeill.

The lamina is often\r\ncharacterised by transverse folds (fig. 330, C).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Taeniopteris Carruthersi._ Fig. 331.\r\n\r\n  1872. _Taeniopteris Daintreei_, Carruthers, Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\r\n        Vol. XXVIII. Pl. XXVII. fig. 6.\r\n\r\n  1883. _T. Carruthersi_, Tenison-Woods, Proc. Linn. Soc. N. S. Wales,\r\n        Vol. VIII. p. 117.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 331. _Taeniopteris Carruthersi_, Ten.-Woods. Nat.\r\n  size.]\r\n\r\nThe simple fronds included under this specific name are characterised\r\nby a strong midrib from which numerous simple or forked secondary veins\r\nare given off at a right angle or slightly inclined. The breadth of the\r\nlamina decreases gradually towards the petiole. The Australian species\r\nnamed by McCoy _Taeniopteris Daintreei_, to which Carruthers referred\r\nthe Queensland fossils, has a much narrower and more linear form of\r\nfrond, and for this reason Tenison-Woods instituted a new specific\r\nname. _T. Carruthersi_ represents a form of leaf met with in Rhaetic,\r\nor possibly Upper Triassic, rocks in S. Africa[1280] and Australia. A\r\nvery similar, perhaps an identical type, was described from Argentina\r\nby Geinitz[1281] as _T. mareyiaca_: among many other examples of\r\nthis form of frond may be mentioned _T. immersa_[1282] Nath. from\r\nthe Rhaetic rocks of Scania and _T. virgulata_ from the Rhaetic of\r\nTonkin[1283].\r\n\r\nA comparison of _Taeniopteris Carruthersi_ or various other “species”\r\nof Rhaetic fronds with the Jurassic species _T. vittata_ illustrates\r\nthe slight and unimportant differences on which specific separation is\r\nbased. It is hopeless to attempt to draw a satisfactory distinction\r\nbetween the numerous Taeniopteris fronds from Upper Triassic and\r\nJurassic rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Taeniopteris vittata_, Brongniart. Fig. 332.\r\n\r\nThe simple leaves to which Brongniart applied this name are\r\ncharacteristic of the Inferior Oolite flora of England, and examples of\r\nthe same type are recorded from Jurassic rocks of India, Poland, the\r\nArctic regions, Japan, China, Australia and other countries[1284].\r\n\r\n  Leaf linear-lanceolate, reaching a length of more than 20 cm. and\r\n  a breadth of 3 cm. The lamina increases gradually in breadth from\r\n  the base and tapers towards the apex. Numerous secondary veins are\r\n  given off at right angles from a broad midrib: the lateral veins\r\n  may be simple or forked close to their origin, near the margin, or\r\n  in the intermediate portion, of the lamina.\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly difficult to use _Taeniopteris_ leaves of this\r\nform as evidence in regard to the Jurassic or Rhaetic age of\r\nplant-bearing strata. The species _T. tenuinervis_ Brauns, as figured\r\nby Schenk[1285] from the Rhaetic rocks of Germany and Persia, and\r\nrecorded from several other regions, presents a close agreement with\r\n_T. vittata_. _Oleandridium lentriculiforme_ Etheridge[1286] from the\r\nHawkesbury series of Australia is another similar leaf. The species _T.\r\nvittata_ from the Yorkshire coast, represented in fig. 332, shows a\r\nwell-preserved petiole with a clean-cut base like that of the petioles\r\nof _Oleandra neriiformis_ and other recent ferns which are detached\r\nfrom the rhizome by the action of an absciss-layer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 332. _Taeniopteris vittata._ (British Museum No.\r\n  39217. ⅔ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nA broader form of frond with similar venation was described by\r\nLindley and Hutton[1287] as _Taeniopteris major_. An examination of\r\nthe type-specimen from the Inferior Oolite of Yorkshire, now in the\r\nManchester Museum, led me to doubt the necessity of specific separation\r\nfrom _T. vittata_[1288].\r\n\r\nA smaller frond of the same general type as _T. vittata_ is recorded\r\nfrom Wealden strata of North Germany and England under the name _T.\r\nBeyrichii_[1289].\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Weichselia.\r\n\r\nThis generic name was instituted by Stiehler[1290] for impressions\r\nof bipinnate sterile fronds, presumably ferns, from Lower Cretaceous\r\nrocks near Quedlinburg. The same type of leaf from English Wealden\r\nbeds had previously been referred by Mantell and other authors to\r\n_Pecopteris_, and by Brongniart to his genus _Lonchopteris_[1291].\r\nIt is, however, advisable to follow Nathorst’s example[1292] and\r\nrestrict the latter name to Palaeozoic species. As already suggested,\r\nit would obviate confusion to substitute a new generic designation\r\nfor _Lonchopteris_ in the case of Triassic species which are probably\r\nmembers of the Osmundaceae. The type-species of Stiehler, _Weichselia\r\nLudowicae_[1293], does not differ in any important character from\r\n_Weichselia Mantelli_, the species originally described by Stokes and\r\nWebb from the Wealden of England as _Pecopteris reticulata_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Weichselia Mantelli_ (Brongn.)[1294].

The pinnules, which may reach a\r\n  length of 9 cm., are characterised by a fleshy lamina attached by\r\n  the whole breadth of the base; the two rows of segments on each\r\n  secondary rachis are usually inclined towards one another so that\r\n  they form with the axis of the pinna a wide-open =V= instead of\r\n  lying in one plane (fig. 333, C). From a median rib are given off\r\n  numerous anastomosing branches (fig. 333, B).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 333. _Weichselia Mantelli._\r\n\r\n  A.

Section of pinna. (After Nathorst.)]\r\n\r\nThis characteristic Wealden species is recorded from England, Germany,\r\nFrance, Belgium, Austria, Russia, Bornholm, North America, and Japan.\r\nIt is by no means certain that _Weichselia Mantelli_ is a true fern: no\r\nsatisfactory evidence of fructification has been adduced.\r\n\r\nThe broad and strong rachis is comparable with that of a Cycadean leaf\r\nand the thick lamina suggests a plant of xerophilous habit. I have\r\nretained the specific name _Mantelli_ on the ground of long established\r\nusage instead of following Fontaine in his adherence to strict priority.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Glossopteris.\r\n\r\nThe name _Glossopteris_ was proposed by Brongniart in 1822[1295] for an\r\nimperfect leaf-impression which he called _Filicites_ (_Glossopteris_)\r\n_dubius_, but the specimen so named has since been identified as\r\npart of a sporophyll of a _Lepidostrobus_. The author of the genus\r\nafterwards published[1296] a diagnosis, based on well-preserved\r\nleaves from Permo-Carboniferous rocks in Australia and India, of the\r\ntype-species _Glossopteris Browniana_, the Indian examples being\r\ndistinguished as _G. Browniana_ var. _indica_ while the Australian\r\nform was named _G. Browniana_ var. _australasica_. Schimper[1297]\r\nafterwards raised the Indian fossils to specific rank as _G. indica_\r\nthough some authors[1298] have continued to consider the two forms as\r\ninsufficiently distinct to be regarded as different species.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Glossopteris_ may be defined as follows:\r\n\r\n  Leaves simple, varying considerably in size, shape, and venation\r\n  characters, but almost without exception characterised by\r\n  repeatedly anastomosing lateral veins. The leaves are of two\r\n  kinds: (i) _foliage leaves_; apparently always sterile, usually\r\n  spathulate, with an obtuse apex, a well-marked midrib which may\r\n  persist to the apex or die out in the upper half of the lamina,\r\n  characterised by its slight prominence and comparatively great\r\n  breadth especially in the basal part of the frond. In most cases\r\n  the lamina extends as a narrow margin to the leaf-base, but in\r\n  a few forms there is a short petiole (fig. 334). Though usually\r\n  spathulate, the frond may be linear-lanceolate, or ovate; the\r\n  apex is sometimes acute. Leaves vary in length from 3 to 40 cm.\r\n  and may in larger forms have a breadth of 10 cm. Numerous lateral\r\n  veins curve upwards and outwards to the margin of the lamina or\r\n  pursue a straight course almost at right-angles to the midrib. (ii)\r\n  _Scale-leaves_[1299] which differ from the foliage-leaves in their\r\n  much smaller size and in the absence of a midrib; they are deltoid,\r\n  oval or cordate in shape and generally terminate in an acute apex;\r\n  the edge of the lamina may be slightly incurved so that the leaf\r\n  presents a convex upper surface supplied with anastomosing veins.\r\n  The scale-leaves, which vary in length from about 1 to 6 cm.,\r\n  probably acted as sporophylls. The only evidence as to the nature\r\n  of the fructification so far obtained is represented by empty\r\n  sporangium-like organs (1·2–1·5 mm. long by 0·6–0·8 mm. broad)\r\n  frequently associated with the scale-leaves[1300].\r\n\r\n  The leaves, in some cases at least, were borne near together on a\r\n  cylindrical stem or rhizome which produced branched adventitious\r\n  roots[1301]. The fossils long known as _Vertebraria_ were\r\n  recognised by Zeiller[1302] and by Oldham[1303] as the stems of\r\n  _Glossopteris_.\r\n\r\nThe systematic position of _Glossopteris_ must for the present be left\r\nan open question. Though usually spoken of as a fern, it is noteworthy\r\nthat despite the enormous abundance of its foliage leaves in the\r\nPermo-Carboniferous strata of India, Australia, South Africa, and South\r\nAmerica, no single example has been discovered which shows undoubted\r\nremains of sori or sporangia. Many authors have described fertile\r\nleaves of _Glossopteris_; but it was not until Arber’s discovery of\r\nsporangia in close association with the scale-leaves that any light was\r\nthrown on the nature of the reproductive organs.\r\n\r\nThe probability is that _Glossopteris_ was not a true fern but a\r\nmember of that large and ever-increasing class, the Pteridosperms.\r\nThis opinion is based largely on negative evidence. Such sporangia as\r\nhave been described may have contained microspores and the plant may\r\nhave been heterosporous. The occurrence of seeds in association with\r\nGlossopteris fronds recorded by more than one writer[1304], though\r\nby no means decisive and possibly the result of chance association,\r\nis favourable to this view. Dr White[1305] has suggested that the\r\nsmall leaves described by Zeiller[1306] as _Ottokaria bengalensis_\r\nfrom Lower Gondwana (Permo-Carboniferous) rocks of India, and similar\r\nfossils recorded by himself from Brazil as _O. ovalis_, may represent\r\n“sporangiferous” organs of _Glossopteris_ or _Gangamopteris_, “both of\r\nwhich are probably pteridospermic.” There is, however, no conclusive\r\nevidence in support of this suggestion.\r\n\r\nThe genus, whatever its position may be, has a special interest for\r\nthe geologist and for the student of plant distribution; it is a\r\ncharacteristic member of a Permo-Carboniferous flora which flourished\r\nover an enormous area, including India, South Africa,—extending from\r\nCape Colony to Rhodesia and German East Africa[1307],—Australia,\r\nand South America[1308]. This flora, known as the Glossopteris\r\nflora, differed considerably in its component genera from that which\r\noverspread Europe and North America and some more southern regions in\r\nthe Upper Carboniferous and Permian periods.\r\n\r\nThe discovery by Amalitzky[1309] of _Glossopteris_, and other genera\r\ncharacteristic of the Glossopteris flora, in the Upper Permian rocks\r\nin Vologda (Russia) demonstrates the existence of a northern outpost\r\nof the southern botanical province, and Zeiller’s discovery of the\r\ngenus in the Rhaetic flora of Tonkin[1310] shows that _Glossopteris_\r\npersisted beyond the limits of the Palaeozoic epoch. Dr David\r\nWhite[1311] has recently proposed to re-christen the Glossopteris flora\r\nthe Gangamopteris flora on the ground that _Gangamopteris_ is strictly\r\nPalaeozoic in its range, whereas _Glossopteris_ persisted into the\r\nMesozoic era; this is perhaps hardly a sufficient reason for giving up\r\nso well established a title as the Glossopteris flora. A fuller account\r\nof this southern flora must be reserved for another volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Glossopteris Browniana_, Brongniart[1312]. Figs. 334–36.\r\n\r\nThe specific name _Browniana_ is now applied to obtusely pointed\r\nleaves which sometimes reach a length of 15 cm., but are usually\r\nrather shorter. In form and venation they closely resemble the leaves\r\nof the recent genus _Antrophyum_ and species of _Acrostichum_. The\r\ncomparatively broad midrib may be replaced in its proximal portion by\r\nseveral parallel veins: from it are given off numerous lateral veins\r\nwhich form a reticulum characterised by meshes approximately equal in\r\nsize and elongated in a direction parallel to the general course of the\r\nsecondary veins (fig. 334).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 334. _Glossopteris Browniana_, Brongn. A. Nat.\r\n  size: B × 3½.]\r\n\r\nThe drawings, originally published by Zeiller[1313], reproduced in fig.\r\n335 illustrate the venation and its range of variation; the meshes\r\nare usually hexagonal and arranged as shown in figs. A and B, but\r\noccasionally (fig. 335, C) they follow a more steeply inclined course.\r\n\r\nSmall leaves with a more or less distinct midrib, 2–3 cm. in length,\r\nsupply transitional stages between foliage- and scale-leaves. In the\r\ntrue scale-leaves spreading and occasionally anastomosing veins take\r\nthe place of the midrib and lateral veins of the ordinary frond.\r\nMcCoy[1314] in describing some Australian specimens of _Glossopteris_\r\nin 1847 spoke of scale-like appendages of the rhizome which he\r\ncompared with the large ramenta of _Acrostichum_ and other ferns. It\r\nwas, however, Zeiller[1315] who first recognised the leaf-nature of\r\nthese scales and adequately described them; additional figures of\r\nscale-leaves have been published by Mr Arber[1316] and by myself[1317].\r\nThe importance of these small leaves has been considerably increased\r\nby Mr Arber’s discovery of associated sporangia which, as he suggests,\r\nwere probably borne on their lower concave surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 335. _Glossopteris Browniana_, Brongn. (After\r\n  Zeiller. × 2.)]\r\n\r\nThe sporangia (fig. 336) are compared by Arber with the microsporangia\r\nof recent Cycads and with the Palaeozoic sporangia described by Zeiller\r\nas _Discopteris Rallii_ (fig. 256, D); the latter are distinguished by\r\nthe well-defined group of thicker walled cells representing the annulus\r\nof true fern sporangia. We know nothing as to the contents of the\r\nGlossopteris sporangia, whether they contained microspores or whether\r\nthey are the spore-capsules of a homosporous plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 336. _Glossopteris Browniana_, Brongn. Sporangia.\r\n  (× 30). After Arber.]\r\n\r\nThe rhizome of _Glossopteris Browniana_ has been described in detail by\r\nZeiller, who first demonstrated that the fossils originally assigned by\r\nRoyle[1318] to the genus _Vertebraria_ represent the stem of this and,\r\nas we now know, of some other species of _Glossopteris_. _Vertebraria_\r\noccurs in abundance in Permo-Carboniferous strata in association with\r\n_Glossopteris_; the differences between Australian, Indian, and South\r\nforms, though expressed by specific names, are insignificant. The stems\r\nare usually preserved in the form of flattened, single or branched,\r\naxes sometimes bearing slender branched roots and characterised by\r\none or two, or less frequently three, longitudinal grooves or ridges\r\n(fig. 337) from which lateral grooves or ridges are given off at right\r\nangles, dividing the surface into more or less rectangular areas 1\r\ncm. or more in length. The surface of these areas is often slightly\r\nconvex and in some specimens the outlines of cells may be detected. Mr\r\nOldham has described some interesting examples of _Vertebraria_ from\r\nIndia in which the longitudinal and transverse grooves are occupied\r\nby a dark brown ferruginous substance or by the carbonised remains of\r\nplant-tissues (fig. 338, C, D). In transverse section, a _Vertebraria_\r\ncast appears to be divided into a number of wedge-shaped segments\r\nradiating from a common centre. Prof. Zeiller[1319] has figured\r\nspecimens of _Vertebraria_ with portions of Glossopteris fronds still\r\nattached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 337. _Vertebraria indica_, Royle. Nat. size. (After\r\n  Feistmantel.)]\r\n\r\nThe rhizome of _Glossopteris_, as represented by the Vertebraria\r\ncasts, is aptly compared by Zeiller[1320] with that of the recent\r\nPolypodiaceous fern _Onoclea struthiopteris_. Sections of the recent\r\nstem (fig. 338, E, F) show that the form is irregularly stellate\r\nowing to the presence of prominent wings which anastomose laterally\r\nat intervals as shown by the examination of a series of sections. The\r\nleaf-traces are derived from the steles of adjacent wings. Fig. 338\r\n(B and A) represents somewhat diagrammatically a longitudinal and\r\ntransverse view of a _Vertebraria_; the radiating arms represented in\r\nthe transverse section (fig. A) are the stem ribs or wings and the\r\nsegments between them are intrusions of sedimentary material. The\r\nrectangular areas characteristic of the surface of a _Vertebraria_ are\r\nthe intruded segments of rock: these are separated at intervals by\r\ntransverse grooves, which mark the course of vascular strands given off\r\nat each anastomosis of the longitudinal wings to supply the leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 338.\r\n\r\n  A, B. _Vertebraria indica._ (After Zeiller.)\r\n  C, D. _V. indica._ (Nat. size. After Oldham.)\r\n  E, F. _Onoclea struthiopteris._ (× 2. After Zeiller.)]\r\n\r\nMr Oldham, who discovered the connexion between _Glossopteris_ and\r\n_Vertebraria_ independently of Dr Zeiller, does not agree with the\r\ninterpretation of the structural features of the rhizome which Zeiller\r\nbases on a comparison between Vertebraria and _Onoclea struthiopteris_.\r\nOldham[1321] describes _Vertebraria_ as consisting of a central axis\r\n“joined to an outer rind by a series of radial septa,” the spaces\r\nbetween the septa being divided into chambers by transverse partitions.\r\nHis view is that the rhizome of _Glossopteris_ was a cylindrical\r\norgan and not an irregularly winged axis like the stem of _Onoclea_.\r\nZeiller[1322] has replied in detail to Oldham’s interpretation and\r\nadheres to his original view, that the rhizome consisted of a solid\r\naxis with radial wings or flanges which at intervals anastomosed\r\ntransversely in pairs at the nodes. It may, however, be possible\r\nthat the spaces between the longitudinal and transverse grooves on a\r\nVertebraria axis, which have been filled with the surrounding rock,\r\nwere originally occupied in part at least by secondary wood, and the\r\ntransverse strips of carbonaceous material[1323] lying in the grooves\r\nmay represent medullary-ray tissue and accompanying leaf-traces. The\r\nlongitudinal striations seen in some specimens of _Vertebraria_ on the\r\nareas between the grooves may be the impressions of woody tissue. It\r\nis impossible without the aid of more perfectly preserved material to\r\narrive at a satisfactory conception of the structural features of a\r\ncomplete Glossopteris rhizome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 339. _Glossopteris_ fronds attached to rhizome.\r\n  (From a specimen lent by Dr Mohlengraaff. Considerably reduced.)]\r\n\r\nIn the specimen of _Glossopteris Browniana_ shown in fig. 339\r\nseveral leaves are attached to an axis which shows none of the\r\nsurface-features of _Vertebraria_. I am indebted to the kindness of\r\nDr Mohlengraaff of Delft for the loan of this specimen which was\r\nobtained from Permo-Carboniferous rocks in the Transvaal. An axis\r\nfigured by Etheridge[1324] from an Australian locality bears a tuft\r\nof _Glossopteris_ leaves, possibly _G. Browniana_; in place of the\r\nrectangular areas characteristic of _Vertebraria_ it shows transversely\r\nelongated leaf-scars or, on the internal cast, imbricate rod-like\r\nprojections which Etheridge suggests represent vascular bundles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Glossopteris indica_, Schimper. Figs. 340, A, 341.\r\n\r\nIt is a question of secondary importance whether or not the fronds\r\nwhich Brongniart spoke of as a variety of _Glossopteris Browniana_\r\nshould be recognised as specifically distinct. The careful examination\r\nby Zeiller of the venation characters has, however, afforded\r\njustification for separating _G. Browniana_ and _G. indica_. We must\r\nadmit that the slight and not very constant differences in the size\r\nand form of the meshes produced by the anastomosing of the lateral\r\nveins are characters which cannot be recognised as having more than\r\na secondary value, though, as a matter of convenience, we employ\r\nthem as aids to determination. The arbitrary separation of sterile\r\nleaves, which differ by small degrees from one another in form and in\r\nthe details of venation, by the application of specific names is a\r\nthankless task necessitated by custom and convenience; it is, however,\r\nidle to ignore the artificial basis of such separation. Mr Arber has\r\nrecently published, in his valuable _Glossopteris Flora_, an analytical\r\nkey which serves to facilitate the description and determination of\r\ndifferent types of frond[1325].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 340.\r\n\r\n  A. _Glossopteris indica_, Schimper. (½ nat. size.)\r\n  B. _Glossopteris angustifolia_, Brongniart. (Nat. size.) From Arber,\r\n     after Feistmantel.]\r\n\r\nThe large leaves of _Glossopteris indica_, reaching a length in\r\nextreme cases of 40 cm. and a breadth of 10 cm., are characterised\r\nby a rather greater regularity in the arrangement of the meshes and\r\nby the greater parallelism of the upper and lower sides of each mesh\r\n(fig. 341) and by less difference in size between the venation meshes\r\nthan in _G. Browniana_, the leaves of which are usually smaller. The\r\nrelatively thick epidermis consists of rectangular cells with stomata\r\nin depressions[1326]. The scale-leaves[1327], rather larger than those\r\nof _G. Browniana_, are more or less rhomboidal with rounded angles and\r\nreach a length of 1·5–6 cm. and a breadth of 1·5–2·5 cm. The rhizome is\r\npractically identical with that of _G. Browniana_[1328].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 341. _Glossopteris indica_, Schimp. (× 1½.) From\r\n  Arber, after Zeiller.]\r\n\r\nThis species occurs in great abundance in the Permo-Carboniferous\r\nrocks of India, Australia, and in various parts of South Africa,\r\nand elsewhere. It has been recognised also by Amalitzky[1329] in\r\nUpper Permian beds in Russia and by Zeiller in the Rhaetic series of\r\nTonkin[1330].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 342. _Glossopteris angustifolia_ var.\r\n  _taeniopteroides_. (× 3½.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Glossopteris angustifolia_, Brongniart. Figs. 340, B; 342.\r\n\r\nIt is convenient to retain this designation for linear fronds with an\r\nacute or obtuse apex and a venation-reticulum composed of long and\r\nnarrow meshes (fig. 340, B). It is by no means unlikely, as Arber\r\nsuggests, that the same plant may have produced leaves of the _G.\r\nindica_ type and narrower fronds which conform to _G. angustifolia_.\r\nIn his description of some Indian specimens of _G. indica_, Zeiller\r\ndraws attention to the variation exhibited in regard to the extent\r\nof anastomosing between the secondary veins: some examples with very\r\nfew cross-connexions agree more closely with _Taeniopteris_ than\r\nwith _Glossopteris_ as usually defined[1331]. The venation shown in\r\nfig. 342 illustrates an extreme case of what is almost certainly a\r\nGlossopteris leaf of the _G. angustifolia_ type. This specimen, which\r\nwas discovered by Mr Leslie in the Permo-Carboniferous sandstone of\r\nVereeniging (Transvaal), has been referred to a variety of Brongniart’s\r\nspecies as _G. angustifolia_ var. _taeniopteroides_[1332] on account\r\nof the almost complete absence of any cross-connexions. The reference\r\nto _Glossopteris_, which my friend Dr Zeiller suggested, is amply\r\njustified by the form of the leaf as a whole, by the angle at which\r\nthe lateral veins leave the midrib, a feature in contrast to the\r\nwider angle at which the lateral veins are usually given off in\r\n_Taeniopteris_ (figs. 329, 332), and by the similarity to the Indian\r\nspecimens already mentioned. Several authors have described leaves or\r\nleaflets under the generic name _Megalopteris_[1333] from Carboniferous\r\nand Permian rocks which bear a close resemblance to the South African\r\nvariety, but in some cases at least _Megalopteris_ is known to be a\r\npinnate and not a simple leaf. The leaf figured by Jack and Etheridge\r\nas _Taeniopteris_ sp.[1334] from Queensland may also be an example of\r\n_Glossopteris_. Comparison may be made also with the Palaeozoic leaves\r\ndescribed in the first instance by Lesquereux and more recently by\r\nRenault and Zeiller as species of _Lesleya_[1335] (fig. 347).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 343. _Blechnoxylon talbragarense_, Eth.: _s_,\r\n  scale-leaves; _x_, secondary xylem. (After Etheridge. A × 2; B × 3;\r\n  C much enlarged.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Blechnoxylon talbragarense_, Etheridge. Fig. 343.\r\n\r\nUnder this name Etheridge[1336] described some specimens from the\r\nPermo-Carboniferous Coal-Measures of New South Wales, which he regards\r\nas a fern, comparable, in the possession of a cylinder of secondary\r\nxylem, with the recent genus _Botrychium_ and with _Lyginodendron_\r\nand other members of the Cycadofilices. The slender axis (1–3 mm. in\r\ndiameter) appears to consist of a zone of radially disposed tissue\r\n(fig. 343, C, _x_), which is probably of the nature of secondary\r\nxylem, enclosing a pith and surrounded externally by imperfectly\r\npreserved remnants of cortex. Unfortunately no anatomical details\r\ncould be made out, but the general appearance, if not due to inorganic\r\nstructure, certainly supports Etheridge’s determination. The stem\r\nbore at intervals clusters of linear-lanceolate leaves (reaching 12\r\nmm. in length) in close spirals (fig. 343, A and B); the leaves are\r\ncharacterised by a strong midrib and forked secondary veins. Small\r\n“pyriform” bodies of the nature of scale-leaves occur in association\r\nwith the fronds (fig. 343, B, _s_).\r\n\r\nIn his description of this interesting plant, Etheridge quotes an\r\nopinion which I expressed in regard to the comparison of the stem\r\nwith those of _Botrychium_, _Lyginodendron_, and other genera.\r\nNo satisfactory evidence has been found as to the nature of the\r\nfructification. Although the leaves of _Blechnoxylon_ are much smaller\r\nthan those of _Glossopteris_, I am now disposed to regard the genus\r\nas closely allied or even generically referable to _Glossopteris_.\r\nThe crowded disposition of the leaves is like that in _Glossopteris_,\r\nshown in fig. 339 and in the figures published by Etheridge and by\r\nOldham; the association of scale-leaves and foliage-leaves is another\r\nfeature in common. The absence of a reticulum of anastomosing veins\r\ncan no longer be considered a fatal objection to the suggestion that\r\nthe Australian type may be a species of _Glossopteris_. If the view\r\nthat _Blechnoxylon_ is not a distinct genus is correct, the occurrence\r\nof secondary xylem is favourable to the opinion already expressed\r\nthat _Glossopteris_ is more likely to be a Pteridosperm than a true\r\nfern. The data at present available render it advisable to retain Mr\r\nEtheridge’s name: the comparison with _Glossopteris_ lacks confirmation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BLECHNOXYLON]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 344. _Glossopteris retifera._ (Nat. size. From\r\n  Arber, after Feistmantel.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Glossopteris retifera_, Feist. Fig. 344.\r\n\r\nIn some _Glossopteris_ leaves the anastomosing secondary veins form\r\na coarser reticulum, as in the example represented in fig. 344. The\r\nname _G. retifera_ was given by Feistmantel[1337] to Indian fronds of\r\nthis type; similar forms have been described as _G. conspicua_ and _G.\r\nTatei_. The type illustrated by _G. retifera_ is recorded also from\r\nPermo-Carboniferous rocks in Zululand[1338], Natal, the Transvaal, Cape\r\nColony, and the Argentine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Gangamopteris.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 McCoy[1339] described a leaf-fragment from Permo-Carboniferous\r\nrocks in New South Wales as _Cyclopteris angustifolia_. The\r\ntype-specimen of this species, which is now in the Sedgwick Museum,\r\nCambridge, has been re-described by Mr Arber[1340]. Subsequently[1341]\r\nMcCoy instituted the generic name _Gangamopteris_ for leaves, like\r\nthat previously referred by him to _Cyclopteris_, from the Bacchus\r\nMarsh Sandstone, of New South Wales, but he did not publish a diagnosis\r\nof the genus until several years later[1342]. Feistmantel[1343], who\r\nhas described many species of _Gangamopteris_ from the Lower Gondwana\r\nstrata of India, slightly modified the original diagnosis. The genus\r\nis represented by sterile fronds only. We know nothing of the stem,\r\nand such evidence as is available in regard to the form of the fertile\r\nleaves is of a circumstantial kind. It is, however, highly probable\r\nthat _Gangamopteris_ is not a true fern but a Pteridosperm.\r\n\r\n  Leaves simple, sessile, varying in shape; obovate or spathulate,\r\n  broadly lanceolate or rarely linear; the apex is usually blunt\r\n  (fig. 345) but occasionally gradually tapered. In general\r\n  appearance a Gangamopteris leaf is similar to that of _Glossopteris\r\n  indica_, the chief distinction being the absence of a midrib.\r\n  Gangamopteris leaves are on the whole larger than those of\r\n  _Glossopteris_; many of them reach a length of 20 cm. and some of\r\n  the large Indian fronds are nearly 40 cm. long. The venation of\r\n  _Gangamopteris_ shows a greater uniformity in the size and shape\r\n  of the meshes than that of _Glossopteris_. The middle of the\r\n  lamina, especially in the lower part, is occupied by a few vertical\r\n  veins from which branches curve upwards and outwards towards the\r\n  edge of the lamina. The secondary veins are connected by frequent\r\n  anastomoses and agree very closely with those of _Glossopteris_.\r\n  The lamina becomes narrower towards the base, which is either\r\n  cuneate or in some cases slightly auriculate (fig. 345).\r\n\r\nAs I have elsewhere pointed out[1344], the presence or absence of a\r\nmidrib is not in itself a character of real taxonomic importance. In\r\nthe recent fern _Scolopendrium vulgare_ the frond has a prominent\r\nmidrib, while in _S. nigripes_ there is no median rib. Mr Arber has\r\nexpressed the opinion that “it is extremely doubtful whether the genus\r\n_Gangamopteris_ should not be merged in _Glossopteris_[1345].” The\r\nretention of the two names is, however, convenient, and it would tend\r\nto confusion were we to carry to its logical conclusion the view that\r\nthe recognised distinction between the two genera may not be a mark of\r\ngeneric difference.\r\n\r\n_Gangamopteris_ is confined to Palaeozoic strata, a fact which\r\nleads White[1346] to speak of the Gangamopteris rather than of\r\nthe Glossopteris Flora. It occurs in South America, South Africa,\r\nAustralia, and India, extending as far north as Kashmir; it has been\r\ndiscovered by Amalitzky in Permian rocks of Russia[1347]. The Russian\r\nrocks in which _Glossopteris_ and _Gangamopteris_ were found are no\r\ndoubt of Permian age. In Australia, South Africa, Brazil and Argentina,\r\nand in the Indian Coal-fields, _Gangamopteris_ is a characteristic\r\ngenus of Lower Gondwana rocks. These strata are usually spoken of as\r\nPermo-Carboniferous in order to avoid the danger of attempting on\r\ninsufficient data a precise correlation with European formations.\r\n\r\nFeistmantel speaks of _Gangamopteris_ as most abundant in the\r\nTalchir-Karharbári beds, though it is represented also in the overlying\r\nDamuda series. In Australia the genus occurs in rocks which correspond\r\nin position and in their plant fossils with the Talchir-Karharbári\r\nbeds of India; similarly, in South Africa and South America the\r\nGangamopteris beds are homotaxial with those of India and Australia.\r\nThe leaf described by Carruthers[1348] from Brazil as _Noeggerathia\r\nobovata_ (the type-specimen is in the British Museum) is no doubt\r\nspecifically identical with _Gangamopteris cyclopteroides_ Feist.[1349]\r\nIn a paper by Mr Hayden on Gangamopteris beds in the Vihi Valley,\r\nKashmir, evidence is adduced in support of the conclusion that the\r\nrocks are “not younger than Upper Carboniferous and may belong to the\r\nbase of that subdivision or even to the Middle Carboniferous[1350].”\r\nIt would seem that _Gangamopteris_ was a very widely spread genus\r\nduring the latter part of the Carboniferous period in the vast\r\nSouthern Continent to which the name Gondwana Land is often applied,\r\nand that it flourished in the Southern Flora during at least part of\r\nthe Permian period: with other members of the Glossopteris Flora it\r\nmigrated to the North where it has been preserved in Permian rocks of\r\nNorthern Russia. The Glossopteris Flora must have had its birth in the\r\nSouthern hemisphere. The conclusion seems inevitable that the leaves\r\nof _Glossopteris_ and _Gangamopteris_ in the shales and sandstones of\r\nIndia, South Africa, South America, and Australia are relics of the\r\nvegetation of a continent of which these regions are the _disjuncta\r\nmembra_. Darwin wrote to his friend Hooker in 1881, “I have sometimes\r\nspeculated whether there did not exist somewhere during long ages an\r\nextremely isolated continent, perhaps near the South Pole[1351].” It is\r\nprobable that _Gangamopteris_ is one of the genera which flourished on\r\nthis continent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gangamopteris cyclopteroides_, Feistmantel[1352].

Pt iii. p. 73.\r\n\r\nThe specimen represented in fig. 345 illustrates the characters of this\r\ncommonest representative of the genus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 345. _Gangamopteris cyclopteroides_, Feist.

Mem. ii.\r\n\r\nThis type agrees closely with _G. cyclopteroides_ in size and in the\r\nform of the leaf, but it is distinguished by the flatter form of the\r\narch formed by the lateral veins, by their greater inclination to the\r\nmargin of the lamina, and by the more acutely pointed apex of the\r\nlamina. This species, though not very sharply distinguished from _G.\r\ncyclopteroides_, is important as coming from beds which have been\r\nassigned on other than palaeobotanical evidence to an Upper or possibly\r\na Middle Carboniferous horizon[1353].\r\n\r\nWe have no definite information in regard to the nature of the\r\nreproductive organs of _Gangamopteris_, but such evidence as there is\r\nsupports the view expressed by Dr White[1354] and shared by some other\r\nauthors that _Gangamopteris_ and _Glossopteris_ should be assigned to\r\nthe Pteridosperms. Despite the abundance of _Gangamopteris_ leaves,\r\nno fertile specimen has been discovered. This negative evidence\r\nmay prove to be as correct as that which led Stur[1355] to exclude\r\n_Neuropteris_, _Alethopteris_ and _Odontopteris_ from the ferns. The\r\nonly evidence of a positive kind is that furnished by Dr David White in\r\nhis recent Report on the Palaeozoic Flora of South Brazil. This author\r\ndescribes some small Aphlebia-like leaves under two new generic names\r\n_Arberia_[1356] and _Derbyella_[1357]. The differences between the two\r\nsets of specimens, so far as can be determined from the reproductions\r\nof imperfect impressions, are slight, and it is by no means clear that\r\na distinction of generic rank exists. These scale-leaves are on the\r\naverage about 2 cm. in length; the lamina is oval or rounded and has\r\nmore or less prominent lobes. In _Derbyella_ there are indications\r\nof anastomosing veins. The specimens referred to _Arberia minasica_\r\nare, as White points out, very similar to the fossil described by\r\nFeistmantel from Lower Gondwana rocks of India as probably a portion of\r\nan inflorescence of _Noeggerathiopsis_[1358]. Feistmantel’s specimen is\r\nrepresented in fig. 346: the curled lobes may have originally borne\r\nseeds. In the Brazilian examples the abruptly truncated lobes “bear\r\nevidence of separation from reproductive bodies.” An important point\r\nis the association of these scale-leaves with _Gangamopteris_ fronds\r\nand with gymnospermous seeds of the _Samaropsis_ type. On the leaves\r\nassigned to _Derbyella aurita_ circular depressions occur at the base\r\nof the lobes which are described as probably due to sporangia.\r\n\r\nDr White’s discovery gives us increased confidence in expressing the\r\nview that _Gangamopteris_ bore its reproductive organs on specialised\r\nleaves very different from the sterile fronds; it also strengthens\r\nthe suspicion that the genus is a member of the class of seed-bearing\r\nfern-like plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 346. _Arberia_ sp. (= _Noeggerathiopsis_ of\r\n  Feistmantel). (Nat. size. After Feistmantel.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Lesleya.\r\n\r\nThis generic designation was instituted by Lesquereux[1359] for\r\nsimple oval-linear leaves from the Coal-Measures of Pennsylvania. The\r\nleaves so named are probably generically identical with the specimen\r\ndoubtfully assigned by Brongniart[1360] to the Coal-Measures, and\r\nmade by him the type of the genus _Cannophyllites_ on the ground of\r\na resemblance to the leaves of the recent flowering plant _Canna_.\r\nFig. 347 illustrates the form of a _Lesleya_ leaf from the Coal-basin\r\nof Gard, named by Grand’Eury _L. simplicinervis_[1361], a type in\r\nwhich the veins are frequently unbranched and not repeatedly forked\r\nas in most examples of the genus (fig. 329, C). The features of the\r\ngenus are, the oval-linear or lanceolate shape of the presumably\r\nsimple frond, its entire or, in one species at least (_L. Delafondi_,\r\nZeill.), finely dentate margin, the stout rachis giving off at a very\r\nacute angle numerous dichotomously branched secondary veins. In _L.\r\nDelafondi_ (fig. 329, C), described by Zeiller[1362] from the Lower\r\nPermian of Autun, the frond may reach a length of more than 20 cm. and\r\na breadth of 8 cm. Similar species are represented by _L. ensis_[1363]\r\nfrom the coal-field of Commentry, and _L. grandis_[1364] from Upper\r\nCarboniferous rocks of North America. The genus is characteristic of\r\nUpper Carboniferous and Lower Permian strata: the form of the leaf\r\nand the direction of the secondary veins suggest comparison with\r\n_Glossopteris_, but in _Lesleya_ there are no cross-connexions between\r\nthe veins. Nothing is known as to the fructification, a fact which\r\nnaturally evokes the opinion that the genus is a Pteridosperm[1365]\r\nand not a true fern. Some years before the discovery of Pteridosperms,\r\nGrand’Eury[1366] suggested that _Lesleya_ might be a Gymnosperm; his\r\nopinion being based on the woody nature of the rachis and on the simple\r\nvenation of _Lesleya simplicinervis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 347. _Leslya simplicinervis_, Grand’Eury.\r\n  (Reduced: after Grand’Eury.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Neuropteridium.\r\n\r\nIn their monograph of fossil plants from the Bunter Series of the\r\nVosges, Schimper and Mougeot[1367] described some pinnate leaves of\r\nferns as species of the genus _Neuropteris_. In 1869 Schimper[1368]\r\nplaced these in a new sub-genus _Neuropteridium_, in order to draw\r\nattention to the fact that their fronds appear to be simply pinnate\r\nand not bipinnate or tripinnate as in _Neuropteris_. The type-species\r\nof _Neuropteridium_ is _N. grandifolia_ Sch. and Moug. from the\r\nBunter Sandstones of the Vosges. The genus includes Triassic European\r\nspecies and the widely distributed Permo-Carboniferous species from\r\nBrazil[1369] originally described by Carruthers as _Odontopteris\r\nPlantiana_. It is probable that some Carboniferous plants, particularly\r\nspecies from the lower members of the formation, referred to the genus\r\n_Cardiopteris_, are not genetically distinct from the Indian and\r\nsouthern hemisphere type _Neuropteridium validum_ (= _Odontopteris\r\nPlantiana_).\r\n\r\n  Fronds pinnate, linear; a broad rachis bears pinnules which may\r\n  be either semicircular or broadly linear with an entire or lobed\r\n  margin. The longer pinnules may exceed 6 cm. in length. The\r\n  pinnules agree with those of _Neuropteris_ in being attached by\r\n  the median portion of the lamina and not by the whole base, which\r\n  is more or less auriculate. In some cases the repeatedly forked\r\n  veins diverge from the centre of the pinnule base; in others there\r\n  is a midrib which persists for a short distance only, and in some\r\n  species the more persistent median vein gives the segments a closer\r\n  resemblance to those of _Neuropteris_. Fructification unknown,\r\n  with the exception of obscure indications of sporangia (?) on the\r\n  fertile leaves of a Triassic species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 348. _Neuropteridium validum_, Feist.

This species is referred to by Dr\r\nWhite[1371] as _N. Plantianum_ on the ground of priority, and with a\r\nview to perpetuate the name of the English engineer Nathaniel Plant who\r\ndiscovered the species in a Brazilian Coal-field in the province of Rio\r\nGrande do Sul. Feistmantel’s specific name is however retained as being\r\nmuch better known. An examination of Mr Plant’s specimen in the British\r\nMuseum led me[1372] to speak of the Brazilian species as identical with\r\n_N. validum_ described by Feistmantel from Lower Gondwana rocks of\r\nIndia. Zeiller[1373] had previously drawn attention to the resemblance\r\nbetween the two sets of specimens. The frond of _N. validum_ may exceed\r\n50 cm. in length. The lower pinnules may be entire and semicircular in\r\nform while the upper and larger segments, which may reach a length of 5\r\nor 6 cm., are characterised by broad lobes (fig. 348).\r\n\r\nThis type is represented in the flora of the Talchir-Karharbári series\r\n(Lower Gondwana) of India[1374], in Permo-Carboniferous rocks of Brazil\r\nand Argentine[1375], and in the sandstones of Vereeniging on the\r\nborders of the Transvaal and Cape Colony. It is a characteristic member\r\nof the Glossopteris Flora and occurs in association with _Glossopteris_\r\nand _Gangamopteris_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Neuropteridium intermedium_ (Schimper). Fig. 349.\r\n\r\nThis species has been figured by Schimper and Mougeot[1376] from the\r\nBunter of the Vosges and more fully described by Blanckenhorn[1377]\r\nfrom the Bunter beds of Commern. The pinnate leaves reach a length of\r\n65 cm.; the lower semicircular pinnules pass gradually into broadly\r\nlinear segments characterised by an auriculate base and a Neuropteris\r\ntype of venation (fig. 354, D′, E). In the example reproduced in fig.\r\n349 from one of Blanckenhorn’s figures, the fronds are attached to a\r\nshort and thick rhizome bearing roots and portions of old petioles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 349. _Neuropteridium intermedium_ (Schimp.). (After\r\n  Blanckenhorn. ¼ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nAn example of another Triassic species is afforded by _Neuropteridium\r\ngrandifolium_ Schimp. and Moug., which agrees very closely with _N.\r\nvalidum_ in the size and shape of the pinnules. The occurrence in\r\nLower Mesozoic European rocks of fronds hardly distinguishable from\r\nthe older southern species may be regarded as favourable to the view\r\nalready expressed, that some at least of the Permo-Carboniferous plants\r\nmigrated north of the Equator. The resemblance between the Vosges\r\nTriassic species of _Schizoneura_[1378] and the examples of this genus\r\nrecorded from the Lower Gondwana rocks of India affords additional\r\nevidence of a northern migration.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the reproductive organs of _Neuropteridium_\r\nis practically _nil_. There is no doubt that Zeiller[1379] and\r\nBlanckenhorn[1380] are correct in regarding the Bunter fronds assigned\r\nby Schimper and Mougeot to the genus _Crematopteris_ as the fertile\r\nleaves of _Neuropteridium intermedium_ or some other species from the\r\nsame horizon. These fronds bear crowded pinnules similar to those of\r\n_Neuropteridium intermedium_, _N. Voltzii_[1381], and other species,\r\nexhibiting on the exposed surface numerous carbonaceous spots which may\r\nbe the remains of sporangia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Cardiopteris.\r\n\r\nSchimper[1382] applied this generic name to Lower Carboniferous\r\nfronds of a simple-pinnate habit which had previously been described\r\nas species of _Cyclopteris_. _Cardiopteris frondosa_ may serve as a\r\ntypical example. This species, originally described by Goeppert as\r\n_Cyclopteris frondosa_ (fig. 350), is recorded from Lower Carboniferous\r\nrocks in the Vosges district[1383] in Silesia, Moravia[1384], and\r\nThuringia[1385]. The pinnules, which are attached in opposite pairs to\r\na broad rachis, vary in length from 2 to 10 cm. and have a breadth of\r\n2 to 8 cm.; in manner of attachment and venation they agree with those\r\nof _Neuropteridium validum_. The venation is very clearly shown in a\r\ndrawing of some large pinnules figured by Stur[1386].\r\n\r\nThe specimen of _Cardiopteris frondosa_, a portion of which is shown\r\nin fig. 350 on a slightly reduced scale, was originally figured by\r\nSchimper from an unusually good example in the Strassburg Museum.\r\nSchimper’s drawing hardly does justice to the original specimen.\r\n\r\nA frond bearing rather narrower pinnules, alternately placed on the\r\nrachis, which Fritsch has described as _Cardiopteris Hochstetterii_\r\nvar. _franconica_ from the Culm of Thuringia, bears a close resemblance\r\nto _Neuropteridium validum_ but differs in the entire margin of the\r\npinnules. An Upper Carboniferous species from Russia described by\r\nGrigoriew[1387] as _Neuropteris_, cf. _cordata_ var. _densineura_,\r\nrepresents another form of similar habit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 350. _Cardiopteris frondosa_ (Goepp.). (¾ nat.\r\n  size. After Schimper.)]\r\n\r\nSchuster[1388] has recently proposed a new generic name _Ulvopteris_\r\nfor a fragment of a pinna from the Coal-Measures of Dudweiler in\r\nGermany bearing large pinnules, which he compares with those of\r\n_Cardiopteris_ and species of _Rhacopteris_. The specimen appears to be\r\nindistinguishable from some of those already referred to as conforming\r\nto _Neuropteridium_, and it is difficult to recognise any reason for\r\nthe creation of a new generic name.\r\n\r\nWe cannot hope to arrive at any satisfactory decision in regard to the\r\nprecise affinity between _Neuropteridium validum_ and species referred\r\nto _Cardiopteris_ and other genera so long as portions of sterile\r\nfronds are the only tests at our disposal. It is difficult to determine\r\nwhether a specimen consisting of an axis bearing pinnules represents a\r\nlarge pinna of a bipinnate frond or if it is a complete pinnate leaf.\r\nThere is, however, no adequate reason for supposing that the presumably\r\npinnate fronds from the Gondwana Land rocks are generically distinct\r\nfrom the Lower Carboniferous European species _Cardiopteris frondosa_.\r\nGranting the probability that both genera are Pteridosperms and\r\nclosely allied to one another, the two generic names may be retained\r\non the ground of long usage and in default of satisfactory evidence\r\nconfirmatory of generic identity. _Cardiopteris_ would thus stand for\r\na type of frond characteristic of the Lower Carboniferous strata of\r\nEurope, while _Neuropteridium_ is retained for the Southern species _N.\r\nvalidum_, and for others from the Trias of the Vosges.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Aphlebia.\r\n\r\nThis name was proposed by Presl[1389] for large leaf-like impressions\r\nhaving a pinnate or pinnatifid form and characterised by a confused\r\nirregular type of venation, or by a fine superficial striation or\r\nwrinkling which simulates veins. Gutbier had previously described\r\nsimilar fossils as _Fucoides_, and other authors have described\r\nAphlebiae as species of _Rhacophyllum_, _Schizopteris_, and other\r\ngenera[1390]. The term _Aphlebia_ is retained, not as denoting a\r\ndistinct genus but (i) as a descriptive name for detached leafy\r\nstructures similar to those figured by Presl, which are now recognised\r\nas laminar appendages of the petioles of ferns or fern-like fronds, and\r\n(ii) as an epithet for highly modified pinnules which frequently occur\r\nat the base of the primary pinnae of Pecopteroid and Sphenopteroid\r\nfronds (e.g. _Dactylotheca plumosa_, fig. 293)[1391].\r\n\r\nModified pinnules, similar in their reduced and deeply dissected\r\nlamina to those represented in fig. 293, are frequently found at the\r\nbase of the primary pinnae of Palaeozoic species of _Sphenopteris_\r\nand other genera of Pteridosperms or ferns, including members of\r\nthe Coenopterideae. Potonié[1392] gives a list of various types of\r\nAphlebiae in his paper on these organs. A striking case has recently\r\nbeen described by Zeiller in a French Upper Carboniferous species,\r\n_Sphenopteris Matheti_[1393]. It would seem that the larger examples of\r\nAphlebiae are more frequently associated with the compound leaves of\r\nPteridosperms than with those of Ferns[1394].\r\n\r\nAs examples of the larger types of Aphlebiae reference may be made to\r\n_Aphlebia crispa_ (Gutb.)[1395], which reaches a length of nearly 60\r\ncm. and has the form of a more or less triangular pinnate leaf divided\r\ninto decurrent deeply lobed segments, to a similar species represented\r\nby _A. Germari_ (= _Schizopteris lactuca_ Germ.)[1396] which simulates\r\nthe leaves of endive (_Cichorium endivia_ L.), and to some large forms\r\nfigured by Grand’Eury[1397] as species of _Schizopteris_.\r\n\r\nAphlebiae such as that figured by Kidston[1398] as _Rhacophyllum\r\ncrispum_, with narrow ultimate segments, might easily be mistaken for\r\nthe impressions of an alga.\r\n\r\nThe term _Aphlebia_ may be applied also to the Cyclopteroid pinnules\r\non the petioles of some species of _Neuropteris_, _Odontopteris_\r\nand _Archaeopteris_. Goebel[1399] has referred to the application\r\nby Potonié and other authors of the term Aphlebioid to the pinnules\r\nwhich serve as bud-protecting organs in recent fronds of _Gleichenia_\r\n(fig. 226, p. 290); he expresses the opinion that it is superfluous\r\nand misleading to make use of a special designation for structures\r\nwhich are undoubtedly modified pinnules. In the case of fossils it is,\r\nhowever, convenient to employ the term _Aphlebia_ as a descriptive\r\nname for modified pinnules or stipular structures which cannot\r\nbe connected with definite species of fronds. It is clear that\r\nsome Aphlebiod leaflets, such as those of _Dactylotheca_, served\r\nas protective organs for the unexpanded pinnae[1400], and in all\r\nprobability the large Aphlebiae served the same purpose as the fleshy\r\nstipules of _Angiopteris_ and _Marattia_ which cover the uncoiled\r\nfronds. The pinnatifid scale-leaves of considerable size (fig. 351)\r\nwhich occur in the leaf-axils or as ochrea-like stipules on the fronds\r\nof _Gunnera_ (a tropical and subtropical Dicotyledonous genus) bear a\r\nvery close resemblance to some Palaeozoic Aphlebiae, e.g. _Aphlebia\r\ncrispa_ (Gutb.). The recent and fossil scale-leaves may be regarded as\r\nsimilar in function as in form; moreover the delicate coiled fronds\r\nof Palaeozoic Pteridosperms or ferns, like those of some recent\r\nflowering plants, may have been kept moist by a secretion of mucilage.\r\nThe pinnatifid stipules of _Marattia fraxinea_ (fig. 241, B, p. 317)\r\nresemble certain fossil Aphlebiae, and the wrinkled surface of the\r\nrecent stipules presents an appearance similar to that which in some\r\nfossil forms has been erroneously described as veining. It is not\r\nimprobable that mantle-leaves of such recent ferns as _Polypodium\r\nquercifolium_ (fig. 234, M, p. 303) are comparable with some fossil\r\nAphlebiae which may have served as humus-collectors for Palaeozoic\r\nepiphytes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 351. Scale-leaf of _Gunnera manicata_. (Slightly\r\n  reduced. M.S.)]\r\n\r\nThe filiform appendages on the petioles of the recent fern _Hemitelia\r\ncapensis_ (fig. 235, p. 304) have often been compared with the\r\naphlebioid leaflets of fossil fronds.\r\n\r\nPotonié who has discussed the nature of Aphlebiae regards them as\r\nvestiges of a once continuous lamina, which formed a winged border to\r\nthe branched axes of more primitive forms of fronds. It is possible\r\nthat the pinnules between the pinnae on the rachis of _Archaeopteris_\r\nand the Cyclopteroid leaflets of _Neuropteris_ and _Odontopteris_ may\r\nhave the morphological significance attributed to them by Potonié. In\r\nsome cases it is probable that the Aphlebiae, whether vestiges or not,\r\nserved the purpose of protecting either the whole frond or individual\r\npinnae. Aphlebiae, though especially characteristic of Palaeozoic\r\nleaves, are occasionally met with in the form of modified pinnules at\r\nthe base of the primary pinnae on Mesozoic ferns, e.g. in _Coniopteris\r\nhymenophylloides_[1401].\r\n\r\nIn some fern fronds the lowest pinnule of each pinna differs in shape\r\nor size from the normal ultimate segments, but it would be almost\r\naffectation to extend the use of the term _Aphlebia_ to such pinnules.\r\nThe Jurassic species _Cladophlebis lobifolia_ (Phill.) is a case\r\nin point[1402]. In this fern, which some authors speak of, without\r\nsufficient reason, as _Dicksonia lobifolia_[1403], the lowest pinnule\r\nis large and different in shape from the others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 352.\r\n\r\n  A. _Sphenopteris obtusiloba_.

After Zeiller.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Sphenopteris.\r\n\r\n_Sphenopteris_ is one of the many generic names which we owe to\r\nBrongniart[1404]. It is the generic designation used for a great number\r\nof Palaeozoic and later fronds, most of which are those of true ferns\r\nwhile some Palaeozoic species are undoubted Pteridosperms. The genus,\r\nwhich is purely provisional, includes members of widely different\r\nfamilies possessing pinnules of the same general type, such as is\r\nrepresented in some recent species of _Davallia_, _Asplenium_, and\r\nother ferns.\r\n\r\n  The fronds of _Sphenopteris_ may be bipinnate, tripinnate, or\r\n  quadripinnate; the rachis may be dichotomously branched or the\r\n  branching may be of the pinnate type characteristic of most recent\r\n  ferns. The pinnules are small; they vary considerably in shape even\r\n  in a single frond, but the chief characteristics are: the lobed\r\n  lamina, contracted and often wedge-shaped at the base (fig. 352),\r\n  the dichotomously branched veins radiating from the base or given\r\n  off from a median rib at an acute angle. The lamina may be divided\r\n  into a few bluntly rounded lobes (fig. 352, C) or deeply dissected\r\n  into linear or cuneate segments (fig. 352, A, B, E).\r\n\r\nExamples of Sphenopteroid leaves have already been described under\r\nthe genera _Coniopteris_, _Onychiopsis_, _Ruffordia_, etc. Among the\r\nnumerous examples of _Sphenopteris_ species from the Carboniferous\r\nrocks mention may be made of _Sphenopteris obtusiloba_ Brogn.[1405]\r\n(fig. 352, A–C), which occurs in the Middle and Lower Coal-Measures\r\nof Britain[1406]. This type is characterised by the almost orbicular,\r\noval or triangular pinnules which may reach a length of 15 mm.; they\r\nare occasionally entire, but more usually divided into 3 to 5 rounded\r\nlobes. The forked veins radiate from the base of the pinnule. The\r\nrachis may be dichotomously branched. Fructification unknown.\r\n\r\nThe species _S. furcata_ Brongn.[1407], characteristic of the Middle\r\nand Lower Coal-Measures of Britain (fig. 352, E), is referred to under\r\nStur’s genus _Diplotmema_[1408] in which it is included by some authors\r\nsolely because of the dichotomous habit of branching of the pinnae.\r\n\r\nThe pinna represented in fig. 353 illustrates a similar type of\r\npinnule. This species, which is very common in the Calciferous\r\nSandstone of Scotland, was described by Lindley and Hutton as\r\n_Sphenopteris affinis_[1409].\r\n\r\nThe fronds of _Sphenopteris affinis_ were discovered by Mr\r\nPeach[1410] in a fertile condition, but he regarded the reproductive\r\norgans as those of a plant parasitic on the _Sphenopteris_ fronds.\r\nKidston[1411] substituted Stur’s genus _Calymmatotheca_ for\r\n_Sphenopteris_ on the ground that the sporangia figured by Peach\r\nunder the name _Staphylopteris Peachii_ bear a close resemblance\r\nto the organs which Stur described as valves of an indusium in his\r\nspecies _Calymmatotheca Stangeri_[1412]. An examination of Stur’s\r\nspecimens by Miss Benson[1413] and by Prof. Oliver and Dr Scott has\r\nconfirmed Stur’s interpretation of the appendages at the tips of the\r\nfertile pinnae as valves of an indusial or cupular structure. The\r\nsuperficially similar bodies on the fertile pinnae of _S. affinis_\r\nare however true sporangia, and cannot legitimately be included in\r\nthe genus _Calymmatotheca_ as described by Stur. For this reason\r\nMiss Benson institutes a new genus _Telangium_, the type-species\r\nof which, _T. Scotti_ from the Lower Coal-Measures of Lancashire,\r\nis based on petrified material. The Scotch species _Sphenopteris\r\naffinis_ (= _Calymmatotheca affinis_ of Kidston) is also transferred\r\nto _Telangium_; the sporangia are considered by Miss Benson to be\r\nmicrosporangia. This with other species is no doubt correctly included\r\nin the Pteridosperms. A complete frond of _Sphenopteris affinis_,\r\nshowing a regular dichotomy of the main axes, is represented by an\r\nadmirable drawing in Hugh Miller’s _Testimony of the Rocks_[1414].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 353. _Sphenopteris affinis_, Lind. and Hutt. From\r\n  the Calciferous Sandstone of Burdiehouse (Scotland). (Sedgwick\r\n  Museum, Cambridge.) M.S.]\r\n\r\nSome of the Palaeozoic species of _Sphenopteris_ probably represent\r\nthe fronds of true ferns, but others are known to have been borne\r\nby Pteridosperms. _S. Hoeninghausi_ (fig. 290, C, p. 399) is the\r\nfoliage of _Lyginodendron_, and Scott[1415] speaks of three species,\r\n_S. dissecta_, _S. elegans_, and _S. Linkii_ as the leaves of\r\n_Heterangium_. Grand’Eury[1416] has recorded the occurrence in French\r\nCoal-Measures of seeds in association with other Sphenopteroid fronds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Mariopteris, Diplotmema, Palmatopteris.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of sporangia on the fronds of several Palaeozoic species\r\nof _Sphenopteris_ and _Pecopteris_ has led to the institution of new\r\ngeneric names, which indicate an advance in knowledge beyond the stage\r\nimplied by the use of those provisional designations based solely on\r\nthe form and venation of the pinnules. Other names have been created by\r\nauthors in place of _Sphenopteris_ and _Pecopteris_ on the ground that\r\na striking feature in the mode of branching of fronds is sufficiently\r\nimportant to justify generic recognition even in the absence of\r\nfertile specimens. As examples of designations based primarily on\r\nthe branch-system of compound leaves, the genera _Mariopteris_,\r\n_Diplotmema_, and _Palmatopteris_ may be briefly considered (fig. 354\r\nA–C). Dr Kidston[1417] is of opinion that the creation of new genera\r\nfor purely vegetative characters of fronds is of no real advantage, and\r\nhe prefers to retain the older provisional names for species known only\r\nin the sterile condition. On the other hand, if we are sufficiently\r\nfamiliar with specimens large enough to enable us to recognise a\r\nwell-defined morphological character, it may serve a useful purpose to\r\nemploy a generic designation for features which may have a phylogenetic\r\nvalue. A comparative examination of Palaeozoic, Mesozoic, and recent\r\ncompound fronds, including both Pteridosperms and true ferns, brings\r\nto light certain distinguishing features characteristic of the older\r\ntypes which, as Potonié maintains[1418], point to the derivation of\r\nthe pinnate habit from a primitive dichotomous system of branching.\r\nFor a more complete discussion of this question reference should be\r\nmade to Potonié’s suggestive papers. Among recent ferns _Matonia_ and\r\n_Dipteris_, two survivals from the past, afford instances of fronds\r\nwith a branching system of the dichotomous type.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in _Gleichenia_, _Lygodium_, and more rarely in species of\r\nPolypodiaceae (_e.g._ _Davallia aculeata_, fig. 232) dichotomy is a\r\nstriking feature of the fronds. In the great majority of recent ferns\r\nthe fronds have assumed a pinnate habit. Among Palaeozoic fern-like\r\nfronds dichotomous branching of the main rachis and of the pinnae is\r\nmuch more common. Potonié draws attention to several other features\r\nwhich distinguish Palaeozoic fronds from the majority of later species:\r\nthe frequent occurrence of pinnules borne directly on the main rachis\r\n(fig. 354, D), and of modified pinnules or Aphlebiae on the rachis\r\nand petiole, are characters to which he attributes an evolutionary\r\nsignificance. The main point is that a comparative examination of\r\nleaf-form affords evidence in favour of the view that the modern type\r\nof frond, with its naked rachis bearing two rows of pinnae, has been\r\nderived from a less specialised type in which the distinction between\r\nthe parts of the leaf is much less evident. The primitive leaf was\r\nprobably a dichotomously branched axis provided with a continuous\r\nlamina which eventually became broken up into separate lobes or\r\npinnules.\r\n\r\nAs the dichotomy of the frond became less regular, a pinnate habit was\r\nacquired, as is clearly seen in many Palaeozoic types which constitute\r\nconnecting links between forked and pinnate fronds (fig. 354, D). The\r\nAphlebiae may be remnants of the once-continuous lamina on the petiole,\r\nand the normal pinnules borne on the rachis may be regarded as the\r\nattributes of fronds in which the division of physiological labour had\r\nnot reached the stage which characterises the leaves of recent ferns.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Mariopteris._\r\n\r\nThis name, which is due to Zeiller[1419], is applied by him to\r\nPalaeozoic fronds characterised by a double bifurcation of the rachis\r\nof the primary pinnae. _Mariopteris muricata_ (= _Pecopteris muricata_\r\nSchloth.) may be taken as the type of the genus. This species is\r\ncommon in the Lower and Middle Coal-Measures of Britain and rare\r\nin the Upper Coal-Measures[1420]. It is described by Kidston[1421]\r\nas one of the most polymorphic and widely distributed Coal-Measure\r\nspecies. The pinnules as seen in fig. 364, B, are of the Sphenopteroid\r\ntype. No fertile specimens are known, but it is significant that\r\nGrand’Eury[1422] has recorded the association of _Mariopteris muricata_\r\nand seeds.\r\n\r\nThe main rachis gives off alternate naked branches, each of which\r\nbifurcates at its apex into two short naked axes, and these are again\r\nforked, the ultimate branches having the form of bipinnate pinnae\r\nprovided with large Sphenopteroid pinnules (fig. 354, B). Zeiller\r\nincludes in _Mariopteris_ some species which Stur[1423] referred to\r\nhis genus _Diplotmema_. Possibly some of the Palaeozoic fronds with a\r\nzigzag rachis may have been climbers like _Lygodium_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 354.\r\n\r\n  A. _Palmatopteris._\r\n  B. _Mariopteris._ (A, B, after Potonié.)\r\n  C. _Diplotmema Zeilleri_, Stur.

The Upper Carboniferous species _Sphenopteris furcata_ Brongn.\r\n(fig. 352, E) may serve as the type. This species occurs in the Middle\r\nand Lower Coal-Measures of Britain[1425]. The main rachis gives off\r\nbranches as in _Mariopteris_, but in _Diplotmema_ each naked lateral\r\nbranch is forked at its apex into two opposite pinnae bearing deeply\r\ndissected Sphenopteroid pinnules. Zeiller[1426] and Stur have recorded\r\nfertile specimens of _Diplotmema_, but in no case have actual sporangia\r\nbeen discovered. In the species _Diplotmema Zeilleri_ Stur (fig. 354,\r\nC, C′) two Aphlebiae occur at the base of each secondary axis[1427].\r\nIt has been pointed out by Potonié that in _Diplotmema furcatum_ the\r\nequal dichotomy of the lateral branches is not characteristic of the\r\nfrond as a whole. In the case of branches higher on the rachis the\r\ndichotomy becomes unequal and the forked axis is gradually replaced by\r\na simple pinna (fig. 354, A). For this type of frond, Potonié proposed\r\nthe generic name _Palmatopteris_ in place of _Diplotmema_, which\r\nhe discards. The long comparatively slender rachis of _P. furcata_\r\nsuggests comparison with the liane species of _Lygodium_[1428].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 355.\r\n\r\n  A. _Cephalotheca mirabilis_, Nath. Fertile pinnae. (Partially\r\n     restored. After Nathorst.)\r\n  B. _C. mirabilis._ Sterile pinnule. Nat. size. (After Nathorst.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Cephalotheca.\r\n\r\nThis genus was proposed by Nathorst[1429] for some peculiar bipinnate\r\nfertile fronds from the Upper Devonian rocks of Bear Island. The pinnae\r\nbear slender forked ultimate segments represented by a few detached\r\nfragments (fig. 355, B), associated with the rachises. The fertile\r\npinnae are given off in opposite pairs from the main axis over which\r\nthey are concrescent (fig. 355, A). A mop-like cluster of sporangia is\r\nborne on the lower surface and close to the base of a fertile pinna:\r\nthe exannulate sporangia are compared with those of _Scolecopteris_.\r\nNathorst compares _Cephalotheca_ with a Belgian species of Upper\r\nDevonian age described by Crépin[1430] as _Rhacophyton condrusorum_ and\r\nby Gilkinet[1431] as _Sphenopteris condrusorum_. A similar fossil is\r\nalso described by Baily[1432] as _Filicites lineatus_ from the Kitorkan\r\nGrits of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe position of _Cephalotheca_ cannot be definitely determined from\r\nthe available data, but it is more probable that it was a seed-bearing\r\nPteridosperm and not a true fern. Zeiller[1433] has recently expressed\r\nthe same opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Thinnfeldia.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Thinnfeldia_, founded by Ettingshausen in 1852[1434] on\r\nsome Hungarian Liassic specimens, though frequently included in the\r\nFilicales, cannot be said to occupy that position by virtue of any\r\nwell-authenticated filicinean features. It is by no means improbable\r\nthat many of the species referred to this genus are closely allied to\r\nPalaeozoic Pteridosperms.\r\n\r\n_Thinnfeldia_ may be briefly defined as follows:\r\n\r\n  Fronds simple and pinnatifid, pinnate or bipinnate: rachis broad\r\n  and occasionally dichotomously branched. Pinnules often fleshy or\r\n  coriaceous; broadly linear, entire or lobed, provided with a midrib\r\n  from which simple or forked secondary veins are given off at an\r\n  acute angle: or the laminae may be short and broad without a midrib\r\n  and traversed by several slightly divergent and forked veins.\r\n\r\n  No satisfactory evidence of reproductive organs has so far been\r\n  adduced.\r\n\r\nThe genus is chiefly characteristic of Upper Triassic, Rhaetic, and\r\nJurassic floras, though it was in all probability represented in\r\nPermian floras. Several species, many of which are valueless, are\r\nrecorded also from Cretaceous and Tertiary formations. Search should\r\nbe made for fertile specimens or for evidence as to the association of\r\nseeds with _Thinnfeldia_ fronds.\r\n\r\nSome Permian fossils from Kansas which Sellards[1435] has made the\r\ntype of a new genus, _Glenopteris_, appear to be indistinguishable\r\ngenerically from leaves of Lower Mesozoic age universally recognised as\r\ntypical examples of _Thinnfeldia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thinnfeldia odontopteroides_ (Morris)[1436]. Figs. 356–358.\r\n\r\nThis is a very variable species as regards the shape and size of\r\nthe ultimate segments and their venation. It is a type of extended\r\ngeographical range characteristic of Rhaetic or Upper Triassic rocks\r\nin Australia, South Africa, India, South America, and various European\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\n  Frond bipinnate; the broad rachis may be dichotomously branched.\r\n  Pinnules with a thick lamina which may be almost semicircular in\r\n  form, deltoid, broadly oval or broadly linear, and often confluent\r\n  at the base. Short and broad pinnules occur on some fronds directly\r\n  attached to the main rachis between the pinnae. The longer and\r\n  narrower pinnules (fig. 356, C), resembling those of the Palaeozoic\r\n  genus _Alethopteris_, have a well-defined midrib, while the smaller\r\n  segments are characterised by several slightly divergent veins\r\n  which spring directly from the rachis (fig. 356, A). Epidermal\r\n  cells polygonal or, above the veins, rectangular in shape; stomata,\r\n  which are slightly sunk, occur on both the upper and lower\r\n  epidermis. Fertile specimens unknown.\r\n\r\nThe portion of a lobed pinnule shown in fig. 356, B, illustrates a\r\nform of segment intermediate between the linear type with a midrib\r\nand a row of shorter pinnules without a median vein. Fig. 356, D,\r\nrepresents another instance of variation in the arrangement of the\r\nveins in segments of different sizes. Various specific and generic\r\nnames have been assigned to Thinnfeldia fronds of Rhaetic age on the\r\nground of the occurrence of pinnules longer and narrower than those\r\nusually associated with _T. odontopteroides_; but in view of the range\r\nof variation met with in a single leaf it is advisable to extend rather\r\nthan to restrict the boundary of what we are pleased to regard as a\r\nspecific type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 356.\r\n\r\n  A–D. _Thinnfeldia odontopteroides_ (Morris).\r\n  E. _Ptilozamites._ (E, after Nathorst.)]\r\n\r\nThe name _Thinnfeldia lancifolia_ has been applied by Morris to fossils\r\nfrom Australia which may be identified with _T. odontopteroides_,\r\nand the same designation is employed by Szajnocha and by\r\nSolms-Laubach[1437] for Rhaetic specimens from South America. Similar\r\nfronds are described by Geinitz[1438] as _Thinnfeldia tenuinervis_\r\nfrom Argentine Rhaetic strata. _Odontopteris macrophylla_ Curran, _T.\r\nfalcata_ Ten.-Woods, _Gleichenia lineata_ Ten.-Woods, and _Cardiopteris\r\nZuberi_ Szaj. afford other examples of what are probably closely allied\r\nforms[1439].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 357. _Thinnfeldia odontopteroides_ (Morris).\r\n  ⅘ nat. size.]\r\n\r\nSome exceptionally large examples of _T. odontopteroides_ are figured\r\nby Feistmantel[1440] from the Hawkesbury series of New South Wales in\r\nwhich the bipinnate frond has a breadth of 25–30 cm. A specimen from\r\nthe Molteno beds of South Africa, probably of Rhaetic age, represented\r\nin fig. 357, illustrates a smaller leaf with pinnules of the linear\r\ntype, some of which are partially divided into shorter pinnules with\r\nforked veins. The example represented in fig. 358, from Cyphergat (S.\r\nAfrica), shows two equal branches of a rachis with small contiguous\r\nsegments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 358. _Thinnfeldia odontopteroides_. From a specimen\r\n  in the British Museum (v. 2490). 1½ nat. size.]\r\n\r\nSome specimens figured by Zeiller[1441] from the Rhaetic strata\r\nof Tonkin as _Pecopteris (Bernouillia?_) sp. may be portions of\r\n_Thinnfeldia_ fronds, and the large leaves which he refers to\r\n_Ctenopteris Sarreni_ differ but slightly from the Australian specimens\r\ndescribed by Feistmantel as _T. odontopteroides_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thinnfeldia rhomboidalis_, Ettingshausen. Figs. 359, 360, C.\r\n\r\nUnder this name Ettingshausen described the type-specimen of the genus\r\nfrom Lower Lias strata at Steierdorf in Hungary. He assigned the plant\r\nto the Coniferae on the ground of a resemblance of the pinnules to\r\nthe phylloclades of _Phyllocladus. Thinnfeldia rhomboidalis_ bears a\r\nclose resemblance to _T. odontopteroides_, but the pinnules are usually\r\nlonger and narrower, as shown in the English specimen from the Lower\r\nLias of Dorsetshire represented in fig. 359. The darker margin of the\r\npinnules shown in fig. 360, C, gives the impression of a revolute\r\nlamina, but a microscopical examination points to a thicker cuticle at\r\nthe edge of the segments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 359. _Thinnfeldia rhomboidalis_, Ettings. Slightly\r\n  reduced. From an English Liassic specimen in the British Museum.\r\n  [M.S.]]\r\n\r\nThe species is recorded from Jurassic rocks of France, Germany, Italy,\r\nIndia, Australia, and elsewhere[1442].\r\n\r\nPalaeobotanical literature contains numerous records of Jurassic,\r\nCretaceous and some Tertiary species referred to _Thinnfeldia_,\r\nbut many of these are probably not generically identical with _T.\r\nodontopteroides_ or _T. rhomboidalis_. Mr Berry[1443] in a paper on\r\n_The American species referred to Thinnfeldia_ concludes that the genus\r\nis “a rather indefinite one ... and badly in need of revision.” He\r\nregards the Middle and Upper Cretaceous American species as Conifers\r\nrelated to _Phyllocladus_ and probably forming a link between the\r\nPodocarpeae and Taxeae: for these forms he proposes the generic name\r\n_Protophyllocladus_. The opinion has been expressed elsewhere[1444]\r\nthat this “problematical[1445]” genus rests on an unsatisfactory basis;\r\nthe available data do not justify the use of a name which implies the\r\nexistence in North American Cretaceous floras of a type related to\r\nthe New Zealand and Tasmanian Conifer _Phyllocladus_. We are not in a\r\nposition to assign a single species of _Thinnfeldia_ to the Filicales\r\nor the Gymnosperms.\r\n\r\nA leaflet from Jurassic rocks of Poland figured by Raciborski[1446]\r\nshows what this author regards as the impression of a circular sorus:\r\nno sporangia have been found. A specimen in the British Museum[1447],\r\nwhich is said to come from Rhaetic beds in Queensland, shows a row\r\nof contiguous polygonal prominences on each side of the midrib which\r\nresemble the sori of a fern; but until sporangia are discovered we\r\ncannot determine the precise nature of this apparently fertile frond.\r\n\r\nA species described by Fontaine[1448] from the Potomac beds\r\n(Wealden-Jurassic) of North America as _Thinnfeldia variabilis_ affords\r\na good example of a plant which cannot be identified with any degree\r\nof confidence either as a fern or a seed-bearing type. Mr Berry draws\r\nattention to the former application of this name by Velenovský to a\r\ndistinct Lower Cretaceous Bohemian species and proposes for Fontaine’s\r\nplant the name _T. Fontainei_; he maintains that no one has doubted\r\nthe fern-nature of the Potomac plant. _T. variabilis_ may indeed be a\r\nfern, but the evidence is not such as to preclude legitimate doubts\r\nas to the correctness of this suggestion. Solms-Laubach[1449], in\r\nreferring to Schenk’s view that _Thinnfeldia_ and its allies may\r\nrepresent a group intermediate between Ferns and Gymnosperms, admits\r\nthat it is a possible supposition; he is, however, inclined to consider\r\n_Lomatopteris_ and _Cycadopteris_, “genera especially comparable with\r\n_Thinnfeldia_” as more probably ferns.\r\n\r\nAt this point we may conveniently consider a series of genera which\r\noccupy an equally uncertain position and bear a very close resemblance\r\nto _Thinnfeldia_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 360.\r\n\r\n  A. _Lomatopteris jurensis_. (⅞ nat. size. After Kurr.)\r\n  B. _L. Schimperi_. (⅞ nat. size. After Salfeld.)\r\n  C. _Thinnfeldia rhomboidalis_, Ett. (Slightly enlarged. British\r\n     Museum. No. 52672.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Lomatopteris.\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Lomatopteris_ was proposed by Schimper[1450] for some\r\nbipinnate fronds originally described by Kurr[1451] from Jurassic rocks\r\nof Württemberg as _Odontopteris (?) jurensis_ (fig. 360, A). I have\r\nelsewhere expressed the opinion[1452] that this German species may be\r\nidentical with _Thinnfeldia rhomboidalis_ Ett. Kurr’s type-specimen,\r\na portion of which is reproduced in fig. 360, A, consists of a frond\r\nor large pinna characterised by a prominent and broad rachis giving\r\noff alternate linear pinnae bearing bluntly rounded, contiguous and\r\nbasally concrescent pinnules having a thick or revolute border and a\r\ncentral rib. The lateral veins are visible in the ultimate segments\r\nof Kurr’s fossil. Saporta[1453] has described several species, which\r\nhe refers to Schimper’s genus, from French Jurassic strata: it is,\r\nhowever, difficult to recognise some of the examples represented in his\r\nillustrations as specifically distinct forms. This author notices the\r\nresemblance of _Lomatopteris_ to _Thinnfeldia_, not only in habit but\r\nin the structure of the epidermal cells[1454]. In _Lomatopteris_ and\r\nin _Thinnfeldia_ the cells have straight and not sinuous walls and the\r\nslightly sunken stomata are surrounded by a ring of epidermal cells.\r\nSalfeld[1455] has recently described portions of fronds from Jurassic\r\nrocks of South-West Germany, which he identifies as _Lomatopteris\r\njurensis_. He disagrees with my view that _Lomatopteris_ does not\r\ndiffer sufficiently from _Thinnfeldia_ to be accorded generic autonomy,\r\nchiefly on the ground that the folded-over edge of the pinnules is\r\na distinguishing feature of _Lomatopteris_. There is, however, no\r\ndifference, in appearance at least, between the leaflets of some\r\nspecies of _Thinnfeldia_, e.g. _T. rhomboidalis_ from Liassic rocks of\r\nEngland[1456], and those referred to _Lomatopteris_. In a later paper,\r\nSalfeld[1457] describes some Portlandian fragments from North Germany\r\nas _Lomatopteris Schimperi_, identifying them with a Wealden fossil\r\nof somewhat doubtful affinity, which Schenk[1458] makes the type of\r\nhis species. The Portlandian specimens are described as tripinnate,\r\nwith thick decurrent obtusely terminated pinnules with a revolute\r\nedge. The general form of the frond is very similar to that of _L.\r\njurensis_. Salfeld publishes a photograph of a large specimen which he\r\ndescribes as fertile and a drawing of a piece of a pinna: the latter\r\nis reproduced in fig. 360, B. He speaks of sori occurring in two rows,\r\nprobably attached to lateral veins, in the groove between the midrib\r\nand the revolute edge of the lamina. The sporangia are described as\r\n“nicht näher bekannt[1459].” An examination of the figures reveals\r\nnothing as to the nature of the “sori.” The specimens are considered\r\nby Salfeld to afford decisive evidence against the view that\r\n_Lomatopteris_ and _Thinnfeldia_ are generically identical. Nothing has\r\nso far been published which constitutes a valid argument in favour of\r\nretaining Schimper’s generic name.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Cycadopteris.\r\n\r\nZigno[1460] founded the genus _Cycadopteris_ on Italian Jurassic\r\nimpressions regarded by Schimper as indistinguishable from\r\n_Lomatopteris_. As Solms-Laubach[1461] points out, the supposed sori\r\nof _Cycadopteris_ described by Zigno are not convincing. There appear\r\nto be no satisfactory reasons for separating _Cycadopteris_ from\r\n_Lomatopteris_, nor do the fronds described under these names exhibit\r\nany important differences from _Thinnfeldia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Ptilozamites.\r\n\r\nNathorst[1462] founded this genus on a remarkable series of\r\nspecimens from the Rhaetic Coal-beds of Scania and assigned it to\r\nthe Cycadophyta. The species _Ptilozamites Heeri_ may be taken as a\r\nrepresentative type. The leaves are linear and simply pinnate. In the\r\nexample shown on a much reduced scale in fig. 361 the frond is 53 cm.\r\nlong and 2·1 cm. broad. The upper edge of each pinnule is straight or\r\nslightly concave; the lower edge is rounded; the veins are slightly\r\ndivergent and dichotomously branched (fig. 356, E, p. 539). In some of\r\nNathorst’s specimens the broad rachis is forked as in many Thinnfeldias.\r\n\r\nAs a comparison of fig. 356, A and E, shows, the pinnules of some\r\nspecimens of _Thinnfeldia odontopteroides_ are identical with those of\r\n_Ptilozamites_. In the latter genus the rachis is either unbranched\r\nor occasionally forked, while in _Thinnfeldia_ the branching may be\r\nof the dichotomous or pinnate type. In _Ptilozamites_ the segments\r\nappear to be always without a midrib, while a median vein frequently\r\noccurs in those of _Thinnfeldia_. There can be little doubt as to the\r\nvery close alliance between the Rhaetic species referred to these two\r\ngenera. The name _Ptilozamites_ should perhaps be retained for such\r\nlong and narrow fronds as that shown in fig. 361: no species included\r\nin _Thinnfeldia_ is known in which the rachis reached so great a length\r\nwithout branching. The habit of _Ptilozamites Heeri_ predisposes one in\r\nfavour of Nathorst’s opinion that the fronds are Cycadean: we have no\r\ninformation in regard to the nature of the reproductive organs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 361. _Ptilozamites Heeri_, Nath. (⅓ nat. size.\r\n  After Nathorst.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Ctenopteris.\r\n\r\nThis name was instituted by Saporta[1463], at Brongniart’s\r\nsuggestion, for Liassic species characterised by pinnules like those\r\nof _Thinnfeldia_, but distinguished by the bipinnate habit of the\r\nfrond. Saporta compares the genus with the Palaeozoic leaves known as\r\n_Odontopteris_, and with Italian Jurassic plants referred by Zigno to\r\nhis genus _Dichopteris_.\r\n\r\nThe name _Ctenozamites_ is applied by Nathorst[1464] to the type of\r\nfrond which Saporta, Zeiller, and other authors refer to _Ctenopteris_.\r\nNathorst instituted _Ctenozamites_ for fossils agreeing in the form and\r\nvenation of the pinnules with his genus _Ptilizamites_ but differing in\r\nbeing bipinnate and not pinnate.\r\n\r\nFronds of _Ctenopteris_ are characteristic of the Jurassic and Rhaetic\r\nseries; they are known only in the sterile condition. As Zeiller[1465]\r\nsays, _Ctenopteris_ may be a member of the Cycadofilices, an extinct\r\ngroup founded on Palaeozoic plants combining Cycadean and Filicinean\r\ncharacters, and some of which are now known to be Pteridosperms. It is\r\nprobable that the genus is not a true fern: it is more likely to be a\r\nmember of the Cycadophyta or of some generalised extinct group.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ctenopteris cycadea_ (Brongniart).

Leckenby\r\nrecognised the possibility of a Cycadean affinity, but regarded\r\nthe bipinnate habit as an objection. The branched fronds of the\r\nAustralian Cycad _Bowenia_ supply an answer to this objection. Several\r\ngood examples of _Ctenopteris cycadea_ are figured by Schenk[1467]\r\nfrom Rhaetic rocks of Persia. Zeiller’s Tonkin Rhaetic species, _C.\r\nSarrani_[1468], affords a striking illustration of the difficulty of\r\ndrawing a clear line of separation between _Ctenopteris_ and some\r\nspecies of _Thinnfeldia_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 362. _Ctenopteris cycadea_, Brongn. (½ nat. size.)\r\n  From a specimen in the British Museum. [M.S.]]\r\n\r\n_Ctenopteris_ is in all probability very closely related to\r\n_Thinnfeldia_ and _Ptilozamites_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Dichopteris.\r\n\r\nThis genus was proposed by Zigno[1469] for some large specimens from\r\nthe Jurassic plant-beds of Northern Italy.\r\n\r\n  The bipinnate leaves are characterised by the great breadth of the\r\n  rachis which is dichotomously branched in the distal region (fig.\r\n  363); the linear pinnae reach a considerable length. Pinnules\r\n  relatively small, oblong and slightly contracted at the base; the\r\n  decurrent and confluent lamina forms a narrow wing to the main\r\n  axis. Veins slightly divergent and forked, as in _Ptilozamites_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dichopteris visianica_, Zigno. Fig. 363.\r\n\r\nA specimen of this species in the Padua Museum has a total length of\r\n83 cm. It has been elsewhere suggested[1470] that a fragment figured\r\nby Zigno as a fertile example of this type is probably part of a frond\r\nof the Osmundaceous fern _Todites_. Since this opinion was expressed I\r\nhave had an opportunity of examining the actual specimen at Padua: the\r\ncircular patches described by Zigno as sori appear to be irregularities\r\nin the matrix and not an original feature.\r\n\r\nBrongniart[1471] instituted the genus _Pachypteris_ for some\r\nimperfectly preserved English Jurassic fossils from Whitby, which he\r\ndescribed as _P. lanceolata_. Specimens have since been described[1472]\r\nfrom the Inferior Oolite rocks of the Yorkshire coast. Brongniart\r\ndescribed the pinnules as being without veins or as possessing only a\r\nmidrib. It is almost certain that the apparent absence of veins in most\r\nspecimens[1473] is due to the fleshy nature of the segments and that\r\nthe species _P. lanceolata_ should be transferred to _Dichopteris_.\r\n\r\nKrasser[1474] has described a species from Cretaceous rocks of the\r\nisland of Lesina, off the Dalmatian coast, as _Pachypteris dalmatica_\r\nwhich is very similar in habit to the English specimens and to Zigno’s\r\n_Dichopteris visianica_. One of Krasser’s specimens is practically\r\nidentical with _Dichopteris lanceolata_ (Brongn.), while in others\r\nthe small pinnules are replaced in some of the pinnae by a continuous\r\nlamina with a few distal serrations. The latter form a link between the\r\n_Dichopteris_ and _Thinnfeldia_ type of segment. Krasser gives a full\r\nrésumé of opinions expressed by other authors in regard to the position\r\nof _Pachypteris_ (= _Dichopteris_) and decides in favour of a Cycadean\r\nalliance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 363. _Dichopteris visianica_, Zigno. (⅓ nat. size.\r\n  After Zigno.)]\r\n\r\nA French Jurassic plant which Saporta[1475] made the type of a new\r\ngenus _Scleropteris_, and described as _S. Pomelii_, appears to be\r\nindistinguishable from _Dichopteris_.\r\n\r\n_Dichopteris_, though conveniently retained as a distinct genus, agrees\r\nso closely, in the broad and forked rachis and in the fleshy pinnules,\r\nwith _Thinnfeldia_ that it would seem reasonable to regard the two\r\ngenera as members of the same group.\r\n\r\nSeveral authors have drawn attention to the striking resemblance\r\nin form and venation between the fronds of the Palaeozoic genus\r\n_Odontopteris_ and those of _Ctenopteris_ and _Thinnfeldia_. In\r\n_Odontopteris_, as in _Neuropteris_, another Palaeozoic genus, the\r\nrachis occasionally bifurcates as in _Thinnfeldia_ and _Dichopteris_,\r\nand the ultimate segments of some species of _Odontopteris_ (fig.\r\n366, A) are practically identical with those of _Thinnfeldia_ and\r\n_Ptilozamites_.\r\n\r\n_Odontopteris_ is probably a Pteridosperm. There is no adequate reason\r\nfor supposing that this group of plants which played a prominent part\r\nin the Permo-Carboniferous floras was no longer in existence during the\r\nMesozoic era.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Odontopteris.\r\n\r\nBrongniart[1476] instituted the genus _Odontopteris_ for compound\r\nfronds from the Coal-Measures characterised by pinnules attached by\r\nthe whole breadth of the base and traversed by numerous forked veins.\r\n_Odontopteris_ is very rare in British Carboniferous rocks and “appears\r\nto be restricted to the Middle and Upper Coal-Measures[1477].”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 364.\r\n\r\n  A. _Alethopteris lonchitica_ (Schloth.). ½ nat. size.\r\n  B. _Mariopteris muricata_ (Schloth.). × 2.\r\n  C. _Odontopteris_ cf. _alpina_ (Presl). ⅗ nat. size.\r\n  D. _O_. cf. _alpina_. Portion of pinna enlarged.\r\n\r\n  (A–D. From photographs by Dr Kidston.)]\r\n\r\n  Fronds large, bipinnate or tripinnate, the main rachis, which\r\n  may be dichotomously branched, bears long linear pinnae with\r\n  broadly linear or deltoid pinnules, acute or blunt, attached\r\n  by the whole of the base; the lower margin of the lamina,\r\n  which is usually entire and rarely lobed (e.g. _Odontopteris\r\n  osmundaeformis_)[1478], is often decurrent on the axis of the\r\n  pinna. The basal pinnule of each pinna is frequently attached by\r\n  a contracted base, and the lamina may differ in form from that of\r\n  the normal segments. Pinnules often occur on the main rachis,\r\n  and in some species the petiole bears modified pinnules which are\r\n  larger than the ultimate segments of the pinnae and in some cases\r\n  Cyclopteroid in shape. The pinnules are traversed by numerous\r\n  dichotomously branched veins; if a midrib is present it dies out in\r\n  the basal part of the lamina. In some species (genus _Mixoneura_)\r\n  pinnules of the Neuropteroid type, characterised by a well-defined\r\n  midrib, occur in association with typical Odontopteroid pinnules on\r\n  the same pinna.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 365. _Odontopteris minor_, Brongn. (Rather less\r\n  than ⅓ nat. size. After Zeiller.) [The pinnules are omitted in the\r\n  right-hand branch.]]\r\n\r\nThe species represented in fig. 364, C, D, from the Middle\r\nCoal-Measures of Barnsley, Yorkshire, illustrates the form and venation\r\nof the _Odontopteris_ type of pinnule. Another species, _O. Reichiana_\r\nGutb.[1479], is also recorded by Kidston from the Lower Coal-Measures\r\nof Lancashire. Some unusually good specimens of the type-species of the\r\ngenus _Odontopteris minor_, Brongn., have been figured by Zeiller[1480]\r\nfrom the Coal-Measures of Blanzy (fig. 365) which show the dichotomy\r\nof the main axis and the occurrence of Aphlebiae on the petiole.\r\nThe late Dr Weiss[1481] divided _Odontopteris_ into two sections,\r\n_Xenopteris_ and _Mixoneura_, the pinnules of the former having the\r\nform shown in fig. 364, D; while in species of the latter sub-genus\r\nsome of the pinnules are identical in form and venation with those of\r\n_Neuropteris_ except that they are attached by the whole breadth of\r\nthe base. Zeiller[1482] employs _Mixoneura_ as a generic designation.\r\nIn an American species _O. Wortheni_ Lesq.[1483] the pinnules bear\r\nnumerous hairs like those on some species of _Neuropteris_ (fig. 373,\r\np. 570). The large size of the fronds of _Odontopteris_ suggested\r\nto Weiss[1484] that they were borne on the stems of tree-ferns, but\r\nGrand’Eury’s[1485] examination of specimens in the Coal-beds of central\r\nFrance led him to picture the plant as bearing a tuft of leaves on\r\na short subterranean stem. Renault and Zeiller[1486], on the other\r\nhand, obtained evidence in the Commentry Coal-field of fronds borne on\r\nelongated stems which grew on the ground and were supported by stronger\r\nplants. Stur[1487] was the first to suggest that _Odontopteris_ should\r\nbe excluded from the ferns. Grand’Eury’s[1488] supposed fertile\r\npinnules of _Odontopteris_ do not afford any satisfactory evidence\r\nof the sporangial nature of the small swellings which he figures at\r\nthe ends of the veins. This author pointed out several years ago\r\nthat the petioles of some species of _Odontopteris_ possess the\r\nanatomical features of _Myeloxylon_, a type of leaf-stalk which is now\r\nknown to belong to Pteridosperms. In a recent paper Grand’Eury[1489]\r\nrecords the association of _Odontopteris_ fronds with small seeds\r\n(_Odontopterocarpus_), a discovery which leaves little or no doubt as\r\nto the Pteridospermic nature of the genus. The fronds of _Odontopteris_\r\nare very similar in habit to those of _Neuropteris_, another\r\nPteridospermic genus.\r\n\r\nThe similarity between some _Odontopteris_ and _Thinnfeldia_ leaves,\r\nto which attention has already been called, is well illustrated by\r\n_O. genuina_ Grand’Eury[1490], a pinnule of which is represented in\r\nfig. 366, A. _Odontopteris_ is a fairly widespread genus in Upper\r\nCarboniferous and Lower Permian rocks, and is recorded also from\r\nTriassic strata: it is represented in the Coal-fields of North America\r\nand in several parts of Europe[1491].\r\n\r\nIn some fronds included in _Odontopteris_ the pinnae are characterised\r\nby a broad irregularly lobed lamina which also forms a winged border to\r\nthe rachis. Examples of this form are afforded by _Odontopteris Browni_\r\nSew.[1492] from the Burghersdorp Series (Triassic?) of Cape Colony, and\r\n_O. Fischeri_ described by Brongniart[1493] from the Permian of Russia.\r\nThe Russian species would perhaps be more appropriately placed in the\r\ngenus _Callipteris_, as Weiss[1494] suggests; the absence of venation\r\nin _O. Browni_ renders generic identification unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 366.\r\n\r\n  A. _Odontopteris genuina_ (Grand’Eury). (× 2⅝.

Zeiller has pointed out\r\nthat such descriptions of fertile specimens as have been written are\r\nunsatisfactory. A few years ago, however, Grand’Eury[1496] recorded the\r\noccurrence of seeds in association with Callipteris fronds in the Autun\r\ndistrict, and in some cases they were found attached to the pinnae\r\nand rachis. The seeds are ovoid or spherical (5–10 mm. broad) and\r\nsmaller than those of _Neuropteris_. The drawings of fertile segments\r\npublished by Weiss[1497] afford no indication of reproductive organs.\r\nPotonié[1498] figures some pinnules of _Callipteris conferta_ in which\r\nthe thick lamina is covered with sinuous grooves probably made by some\r\ninsect larvae: as he suggests, similar markings may have been mistaken\r\nfor the remains of sori. The occurrence of _Callipteris_ fronds\r\nrecorded by Weber and Sterzel[1499] in association with _Medullosa_\r\nstems in the Lower Permian of Saxony is in accordance with Grand’Eury’s\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\n  Fronds reaching 1 metre in length, bipinnate or tripinnate, main\r\n  rachis frequently exhibiting a combination of dichotomous and\r\n  pinnate branching. Pinnae linear, usually crowded, decurrent on the\r\n  rachis; the pinnules on the lower side of the pinnae are continued\r\n  on to the rachis. Pinnules of the Pecopteroid type, entire or\r\n  slightly lobed, or of the Sphenopteroid type and more or less\r\n  deeply dissected (fig. 366 C, D), the lamina of adjacent pinnules\r\n  concrescent; on the lower pinnae the lamina may be continuous as in\r\n  an Alethopteris pinnule. A midrib may extend almost to the bluntly\r\n  rounded apex of the ultimate segments, giving off oblique, simple,\r\n  or forked veins, the lowest of which arise directly from the\r\n  rachis; in the Sphenopteroid forms the lateral veins are given off\r\n  at a more acute angle.\r\n\r\nA striking feature of the genus is the occurrence of pinnules on the\r\nmain rachis, as in _Odontopteris_. Zeiller has wisely extended the\r\napplication of _Callipteris_ to fronds possessing this character\r\nirrespective of the entire or lobed form of the ultimate segments.\r\nHe found among the numerous examples of the genus obtained from\r\nAutun[1500] and Lodève[1501] transitional forms connecting such\r\nspecies as _C. conferta_ (fig. 367) and _C. Pellati_ Zeill. (fig. 366,\r\nC) in which the Pecopteroid pinnules are slightly lobed, with _C.\r\nlyratifolia_ (Goepp.) (fig. 366, D), _C. flabellifera_[1502] (Weiss),\r\nand _C. Bergeroni_ Zeill. characterised by deeply lobed Sphenopteroid\r\nsegments.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Callipteris conferta_ (Sternberg)[1503]. Fig. 367.\r\n\r\n  1723. Scheuchzer, Herb. Diluv. Pl.

Vorwelt, p. 17.\r\n\r\n  1849. _Callipteris conferta_, Brongniart, Tableau, p. 24.\r\n\r\nThis polymorphic species (fig. 367) is one of the most characteristic\r\nPermian plants. The oval-linear pinnules, attached by the whole base,\r\noccur on both pinnae and rachis; this feature, the thick texture of the\r\nlamina, and the linear, obliquely set, pinnae render the fronds easily\r\nrecognisable. The fronds bore seeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 367. _Callipteris conferta_. From the Permian of\r\n  Aschbach, Rhenish Prussia (British Museum, No. 39052).]\r\n\r\nIn a recent account of some Permian plants from Germany, Schuster[1504]\r\nrefers a portion of a frond to _Callipteris conferta_ (Sternberg) var.\r\n_polymorpha_ Sterzel, which is characterised by unusually large and\r\npolymorphic pinnules. In size and shape the pinnules recall those of\r\n_Neuropteridium validum_ Feist.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Callipteridium.\r\n\r\nThe name _Callipteridium_, created by Weiss[1505] as a sub-genus of\r\n_Odontopteris_, is applied by Zeiller and other authors to a few Upper\r\nCarboniferous and Permian species characterised by the occurrence\r\nof simply pinnate pinnae on the main rachis between the bipinnate\r\nprimary pinnae. Single pinnules are borne directly on the rachis of the\r\nprimary pinnae between the pinnate branches. The form and venation of a\r\ntypical pinnule are shown in fig. 366, B. _Callipteridium pteridium_,\r\noriginally recorded by Schlotheim as _Filicites pteridius_[1506],\r\nhas been fully described by Renault and Zeiller from unusually large\r\nspecimens found in the Commentry Coal-field[1507]. This species\r\nillustrates the peculiar morphological features of the genus. The\r\nmain rachis of the tripinnate fronds, several metres long, shows a\r\ncombination of dichotomous and pinnate branching; from the zigzag\r\nand forked axis are given off bipinnate pinnae and, between these,\r\nshorter pinnate branches. The pinnules closely resemble those of\r\n_Callipteris conferta_ but reach a greater length; the pinnules borne\r\non the rachises of the lateral branches differ from the others in their\r\nbroader base and more triangular lamina.\r\n\r\nNo fertile specimens have been found. It is probable that\r\n_Callipteridium_ was not a true fern, and that White[1508] is correct\r\nin including it among the Pteridosperms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Archaeopteris.\r\n\r\nIn 1852 Forbes[1509] published a brief description of some supposed\r\nfern fronds, found by the Geological Surveyors of Ireland in Upper\r\nDevonian rocks of Kilkenny, under the name _Cyclopteris hibernica_.\r\nThe Irish specimens were more fully described by Baily[1510] in\r\n1858. Fronds of the same type were referred by other authors to\r\n_Cyclopteris_, _Adiantites_ or _Noeggerathia_, until Schimper[1511]\r\nproposed the generic name _Palaeopteris_ on the ground that the fronds\r\ndescribed by Forbes and Baily are distinguished by the nature of\r\ntheir fertile pinnae from the sterile leaves included in Brongniart’s\r\nprovisional genus _Cyclopteris_. The earlier use of _Palaeopteris_ by\r\nGeinitz for an entirely different plant led Dawson[1512] to institute\r\nthe genus _Archaeopteris_. The genus _Archaeopteris_ may be defined as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Fronds bipinnate, reaching a considerable length (90 cm.); the\r\n  stout rachis bears long linear pinnae; sterile pinnules obovate\r\n  or cuneate with an entire, lobed, fimbriate, or laciniate lamina\r\n  traversed by divergent dichotomously branched veins. The fertile\r\n  pinnae usually occur on the lower part of the rachis; pinnules with\r\n  a much reduced lamina bear numerous fusiform or oval exannulate\r\n  sporangia (fig. 369, A, E, H), sessile or shortly stalked,\r\n  singly, or in groups of two or three. The base of the petiole is\r\n  characterised by a pair of partially adnate stipules (fig. 369,\r\n  C, D), and single pinnules or scales occur in some species on the\r\n  rachis between the pinnae and on the petiole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 368. _Archaeopteris hibernica_. (From a specimen in\r\n  the Science and Art Museum, Dublin. Rather less than ⅙ nat. size.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Archaeopteris hibernica_ (Forbes). Figs. 368, 369, A–C.\r\n\r\nThe specimen from Kilkenny represented in fig. 368 has a length of\r\nover 80 cm. The upper pinnae bear numerous imbricate obovate pinnules\r\n(fig. 369, A, B) with an entire or very slightly fimbriate margin,\r\nwhile on the shorter lower pinnae the ultimate segments are reduced to\r\na slender axis bearing numerous fusiform sporangia, 2–3 mm. in length.\r\nKidston[1513] has pointed out that sporangia occasionally occur on the\r\nedge of ordinary pinnules, and he first recognised the stipular nature\r\nof the scale-like appendages which Baily noticed on the swollen petiole\r\nbase (5 cm. broad) of the Irish species (fig. 369, C). Restorations\r\nof _Archaeopteris hibernica_ have been figured by Baily[1514] and\r\nby Carruthers[1515], but the description of the fertile pinnae by\r\nthe latter author requires modification in the light of Kidston’s\r\ndescription of the Dublin specimens.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\n_Archaeopteris_ is recorded from Upper Devonian rocks of the South of\r\nIreland, Belgium, Germany, Southern Russia, Bear Island, and Ellesmere\r\nLand in the Arctic regions, Canada, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere.\r\nMany of the specimens described under different names bear a close\r\nresemblance, which in some cases probably amounts to specific identity,\r\nto _A. hibernica_. _A. Jacksoni_ originally described by Dawson[1516]\r\nand more recently by Smith and White[1517] from Devonian rocks of\r\nMaine, the Canadian type _A. gaspiensis_ Daws., and some species\r\nfigured by Lesquereux[1518] from Pennsylvania, are examples of forms\r\nwhich present a striking similarity in habit to the Irish species. The\r\nBelgian Devonian fossils named by Crépin[1519] _Palaeopteris hibernica_\r\nvar. _minor_ are regarded by him as probably identical with Goeppert’s\r\nspecies _Cyclopteris Roemeriana_ from the neighbourhood of Aachen. Heer\r\nrecorded _Archaeopteris Roemeriana_ from Upper Devonian beds in Bear\r\nIsland, and Nathorst[1520], who has published a more complete account\r\nof the Arctic forms, draws attention to the resemblance of some of\r\nthem to _A. hibernica_. A species described by Schmalhausen[1521] from\r\nthe Upper Devonian of Southern Russia as _A. archetypus_ (fig. 369,\r\nD) appears to differ from _A. hibernica_ in the slightly less reduced\r\nlamina of the fertile segments. This species has been more adequately\r\nillustrated by Nathorst[1522] from material collected in Ellesmere\r\nLand: he is unable to confirm Schmalhausen’s statement that the pinnae\r\nare spirally disposed.\r\n\r\nThe species _A. fimbriata_ (fig. 369, G) described by Nathorst from\r\nBear Island is characterised by the more deeply dissected lamina of the\r\nsterile pinnules. In _A. fissilis_ Schmal. from Russia and Ellesmere\r\nLand the lamina (fig. 369, E, F) is cut up into filiform segments: a\r\nfertile pinnule of this species is represented in fig. 369, E.\r\n\r\nSome sterile impressions figured by Krasser[1523] from Palaeozoic\r\nstrata (Lower Carboniferous or Upper Devonian?) in the province of\r\nNanshan in China as _Noeggerathia acuminifissa_ are considered by\r\nZeiller[1524] to be portions of an _Archaeopteris_ or _Rhacopteris_\r\nfrond. The resemblance to the former genus is however by no means close\r\nenough to warrant a reference to _Archaeopteris_. The sterile specimens\r\ndescribed by Stur[1525] from the Culm of Altendorf as species of\r\n_Archaeopteris_ are probably not generically identical with the Irish\r\nand Arctic species. The dichotomous branching of the rachis in _A.\r\nTschermaki_ and _A. Dawsoni_ is a feature unknown in _Archaeopteris_.\r\nIn the absence of fertile pinnae the separation of _Archaeopteris_ from\r\n_Rhacopteris_ is by no means easy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 369.\r\n\r\n  A. _Archaeopteris hibernica._ Fertile pinna.

The latter author regarded the presence of\r\nstipules and the structure of the exannulate sporangia as evidence of\r\na Marattiaceous alliance. In a later reference to _Archaeopteris_,\r\nKidston expresses the opinion that the genus is not a true fern but\r\na member of the Cycadofilices or Pteridosperms, a view shared by\r\nGrand’Eury[1527] and doubtless by many other palaeobotanists. The\r\nsporangia of _Archaeopteris_ appear to be of the same type as those\r\nof _Dactylotheca_ (fig. 290, E, p. 399). Schmalhausen gave expression\r\nto his disagreement with Nathorst and other authors who referred\r\n_Archaeopteris_ to the Marattiaceae by proposing the distinctive\r\ngroup-name Archaeopterideae.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that the reproductive organs of\r\n_Archaeopteris_ so far discovered are microsporangia, and that the\r\nplant bore seeds. The sporangia are larger than those of any known fern\r\nand, as Kidston points out, they are similar to those of _Crossotheca_\r\nwhich he has shown to be microsporangia of the Pteridosperm\r\n_Lyginodendron_. The presence of stipules in _Archaeopteris hibernica_,\r\n_A. fimbriata_, _A. archetypus_ (fig. 369, D) and probably throughout\r\nthe genus does not materially affect the question of taxonomic\r\nposition. Stipules are a characteristic feature of Marattiaceae and,\r\nin a reduced form, of Osmundaceae, but similar appendages are borne at\r\nthe base of the petiole of the Cycad _Ceratozamia_. The occurrence of\r\nAphlebiae on the rachis of _Archaeopteris_ is a feature shared by the\r\nfronds of _Neuropteris_ and other Pteridosperms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Neuropteris.\r\n\r\nThe fronds for which Brongniart[1528] created this genus, though\r\nsuspected by Stur in 1883 as wrongly classed among the ferns, have only\r\nrecently been shown to be the leaves of Pteridosperms. As yet only one\r\ncase is recorded in which\r\n\r\n_Neuropteris_ pinnae occur in organic connexion with seeds[1529],\r\nbut it is almost certain that the genus as a whole must be placed in\r\nthis generalised group. Renault[1530] pointed out that the petioles\r\nof Neuropteris fronds from Autun had the anatomical features of\r\n_Myeloxylon_ (petiole of _Medullosa_). Since Kidston’s important\r\ndiscovery of seed-bearing pinnae of _N. heterophylla_, Grand’Eury[1531]\r\nhas recorded the association of Neuropteris fronds with seeds in\r\nFrench Coal-fields. By some of the older authors _Neuropteris_ was\r\ncompared with _Osmunda_ because of a similarity in venation. In the\r\nfrequent dichotomy of the frond and in the occurrence of pinnules on\r\nthe rachis, _Neuropteris_ closely resembles _Odontopteris_[1532]: there\r\ncan be little doubt as to the close relationship of the Pteridosperms\r\npossessing these two types of foliage. _Neuropteris_ may be defined as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Fronds reaching a considerable size, probably in soma cases a\r\n  length of 10 metres[1533]; bi- or tri-pinnate; the rachis may be\r\n  dichotomously branched (figs. 354, D; 370); both rachis and petiole\r\n  bear single pinnules, those on the latter frequently differ from\r\n  the normal leaflets in their larger Cyclopteroid laminae (fig.\r\n  370). Pinnules entire, rarely slightly lobed, broadly linear,\r\n  attached by a small portion of the base, which is usually more or\r\n  less cordate. In _N. Grangeri_ Brongn. the pinnules are attached by\r\n  a short pedicel[1534]. The midrib always dies out before reaching\r\n  the blunt or pointed apex of the lamina and gives off at an acute\r\n  angle numerous secondary veins characterised by their arched course\r\n  and repeated forking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 370. _Neuropteris_ frond with _Cyclopteris_\r\n  leaflets. English Coal-Measures. (From a block given to me by Mr\r\n  Carruthers. A.C.S.)]\r\n\r\nPotonié describes the secondary veins of the pinnules of _Neuropteris\r\npseudogigantea_[1535] as occasionally anastomosing, a feature which may\r\nbe regarded as a step towards the reticulate venation of the closely\r\nallied genus _Linopteris_.\r\n\r\nRenault[1536] described some petrified pinnules of _Neuropteris_ in\r\nwhich the mesophyll shows a differentiation into upper palisade tissue\r\nand lacunar tissue below; the lower epidermis is infolded at intervals\r\nwhere grooves (probably stomatal) occur like those on the leaves of an\r\nOleander (_Nerium oleander_).\r\n\r\nThe rachises of Neuropteris fronds are described by Grand’Eury under\r\nthe generic name _Aulacopteris_[1537].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Neuropteris heterophylla_, Brongniart[1538].

The fronds are\r\nlarge and tripinnate, the rachis is often dichotomously branched and\r\nCyclopteroid pinnules may occur on the petiole. The pinnules, 5–20 mm.\r\nin length and 3–8 mm. broad, have a rounded apex (fig. 354, E, p. 535).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 371. _Neuropteris heterophylla._ From a specimen in\r\n  the Manchester Museum. ½ nat. size.

From a\r\n  photograph by Mr Hemingway.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Neuropteris Scheuchzeri_, Hoffmann. Figs. 354, F; 373.\r\n\r\nFragments of this well-known Coal-Measure species were figured by\r\nScheuchzer in his _Herbarium Diluvianum_[1540] as _Lithosmunda minor_,\r\nand by Lhywd (Luidius[1541]) as _Phyllites mineralis_ as early as\r\n1760. _Neuropteris Scheuchzeri_, so named by Hoffmann in 1826, is\r\na type which many authors have described under different names.\r\nLesquereux[1542] figured it as _N. hirsuta_ from the Coal-fields of\r\nPennsylvania, and under the same name it is recorded by Fontaine and\r\nWhite[1543] from Permian rocks of Virginia. The oval patches on the\r\nsurface of a pinnule described by these authors as sori are certainly\r\nnot of that nature. The same species is described by Bunbury[1544] from\r\nNova Scotia as _N. cordata_ Brongn. var. _angustifolia_. For a full\r\nsynonymy of the species reference should be made to lists published by\r\nKidston[1545], White[1546], and Zeiller[1547].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 373. _Neuropteris Scheuchzeri._ From a specimen (v.\r\n  2009) in the British Museum. ¾ nat. size.]\r\n\r\nThe large tripinnate fronds are characterised by the long linear-\r\nor oval-lanceolate pinnules (fig. 373)[1548] with a pointed apex\r\nand numerous bristle-like hairs on the lamina; two much smaller\r\nCyclopteroid segments occur at the base of the pinnae which are\r\nterminated by the linear leaflets (fig. 354, F, p. 535).\r\n\r\n_Neuropteris Scheuchzeri_ is characteristic of the Upper and Middle\r\nCoal-Measures of Britain and is recorded from several localities in\r\nNorth America and the Continent. Zalessky[1549] has recently recorded\r\nthe species from the Coal-Measures of Donetz. The frequent occurrence\r\nof detached pinnules points to a caducous habit. Even single leaflets\r\ncan, however, be identified by their large size, the pointed apex, and\r\nhairy lamina. The hairs are preserved as fine oblique lines simulating\r\nveins; they were so described by Roemer[1550] who took them for\r\ncross-connexions between the secondary veins and referred the pinnules\r\nto Gutbier’s genus _Dictyopteris_.\r\n\r\nAnother example of _Neuropteris_ with hairy pinnules is described from\r\nthe Commentry Coal-field by Renault and Zeiller as _N. horrida_[1551].\r\nThe oval-linear, bluntly rounded, pinnules are characterised by a\r\nmedian band of hairs on each surface and a narrower strip at the edge\r\nof the lamina.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Cyclopteris.\r\n\r\nThis generic name was created by Brongniart in 1828[1552] for specimens\r\nwhich he believed to be complete single leaves of orbicular or reniform\r\nshape similar to those of _Trichomanes reniforme_. The lamina is\r\ntraversed by numerous dichotomously branched veins which spread from\r\nthe centre of the base.\r\n\r\nIt was suspected by Lindley and Hutton[1553] that certain Cyclopteris\r\nleaves belonged to the frond of a species of _Neuropteris_, and some\r\nyears later Lesquereux[1554] concluded that Brongniart’s genus was\r\nfounded on orbicular leaflets of _Neuropteris_. In 1869 Roehl[1555]\r\nfigured a specimen of _Neuropteris_ bearing Cyclopteroid pinnules on\r\nits rachis. It is now universally admitted that _Cyclopteris_ is not a\r\ndistinct genus and that the specimens so named were borne as modified\r\npinnules on the main rachis of _Neuropteris_ and _Odontopteris_. It\r\nis, however, convenient to retain the name for detached leaflets which\r\ncannot be referred to the fronds on which they were borne. A specimen\r\nfound by Mr Hemingway in the Upper Coal-Measures of Yorkshire and\r\ndescribed in 1888[1556] affords a striking example of the large size\r\nattained by what was probably a frond of _Neuropteris_. The piece of\r\nmain rachis reached a length of over 120 cm. and bore five pairs of\r\nCyclopteris pinnules, some of which were 7 cm. long and 5 cm. broad.\r\nThe complete frond must have reached a length of at least 4 metres.\r\nFig. 370 shows some typical Cyclopteroid leaflets on the petiole of a\r\n_Neuropteris_ frond.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Linopteris.\r\n\r\nThe Upper Palaeozoic fronds included in this genus are more familiar\r\nas species of _Dictyopteris_. Potonié[1557] has, however, pointed out\r\nthat the creation of this name by Lamouroux in 1809 for a genus of\r\nBrown Algae which is still retained, makes it advisable to fall back\r\nupon the designation _Linopteris_. Gutbier[1558] proposed the genus\r\n_Dictyopteris_ in 1835: _Linopteris_ was first used by Presl[1559] in\r\n1838. The fronds so named are identical with species of _Neuropteris_\r\nexcept in the anastomosis of the secondary veins; _Linopteris_\r\nbears to _Neuropteris_ the same relation as _Lonchopteris_ bears to\r\n_Alethopteris_. As in _Neuropteris_, Cyclopteroid pinnules occur on\r\nthe petioles of _Linopteris_, but the veins form a fine reticulum.\r\nGrand’Eury[1560] records the association of _Linopteris Brongniarti_\r\nwith seeds belonging to the genus _Hexagonocarpon_, a fact which points\r\nto the Pteridosperm nature of the foliage.\r\n\r\nSome fertile pinnules of _Linopteris Schutzei_ (Roemer) are described\r\nby Zeiller[1561] from Autun as bearing on the under surface of the\r\nlamina two rows of long and pointed sporangia, probably united in\r\ngroups. The presumption is that these are microsporangia.\r\n\r\nFig. 374 is a reproduction of a careful drawing, originally published\r\nby Zeiller[1562], of a pinnule of the type-specimen of Gutbier’s\r\nspecies _Linopteris neuropteroides_. This species differs from\r\n_Linopteris obliqua_, instituted by Bunbury[1563] for specimens\r\nobtained by Lyell[1564] from the Coal-Measures of Nova Scotia, in\r\nthe smaller size of the meshes. _Linopteris obliqua_ occurs in the\r\nUpper and Middle Coal-Measures of Britain; it is recorded by Zeiller\r\nfrom Asia Minor, by Lesquereux[1565] from Pennsylvania, and by other\r\nauthors from several European localities. The pinnules frequently occur\r\ndetached from the frond and like those of some species of _Neuropteris_\r\nwere caducous. _Linopteris_ is rare in British strata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 374. _Linopteris neuropteroides_, Gutb. (Pinnule of\r\n  type-specimen. Enlarged. After Zeiller.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Alethopteris.\r\n\r\nThe name _Alethopteris_, instituted by Sternberg[1566], is applied to\r\ncompound fronds often reaching a considerable size, exhibiting the\r\nfollowing features:\r\n\r\n  The linear pinnules are attached by the whole breadth of the base,\r\n  with the lower edge of the lamina decurrent and usually continuous\r\n  with that of the next pinnule (figs. 290, A, p. 399; 375). The\r\n  ultimate segments are entire, with an acute or rounded apex and\r\n  often characterised by a fairly thick lamina convex on the upper\r\n  surface. From a prominent midrib, continued to the apex of the\r\n  pinnule, numerous simple and forked secondary veins are given\r\n  off at a wide angle, the decurrent portion of the lamina being\r\n  supplied by veins direct from the axis of the pinna. In the upper\r\n  part of a frond or primary pinna the pinnules may be replaced by\r\n  a continuous, lobed, or entire simple lamina. The main rachis\r\n  occasionally exhibits dichotomous branching, but the fronds are for\r\n  the most part constructed on the pinnate plan. Single Cyclopteroid\r\n  pinnules[1567] occur on the petiole of some species of the genus.\r\n\r\nIn certain species of _Alethopteris_ the pinnules appear to have been\r\ndeciduous as in _Didymochlaena_ among recent ferns[1568]. A piece of\r\ncuticle from the upper surface of a pinnule of _Alethopteris Grandini_\r\n(Brongn.) figured by Zeiller[1569] shows very clearly the polygonal\r\nform and straight walls of most of the epidermal cells, those above the\r\nveins being almost rectangular. The position of the sunken stomata is\r\nrevealed by small circular spaces surrounded by a circle of cells.\r\n\r\nThe absence of fertile specimens of this common genus of Upper\r\nCarboniferous plants led Stur[1570] to exclude it from the ferns.\r\nAlthough no seeds have so far been found in organic connexion with an\r\nAlethopteris frond, it is certain that some species, probably all,\r\nrepresent the foliage of Pteridosperms. Renault was the first to\r\ndescribe petrified specimens of _Alethopteris_ fronds exhibiting the\r\nanatomical structure of _Myeloxylon_ (leaf-axis of _Medullosa_). The\r\ncalcareous nodules from English Coal-seams contain numerous fragments\r\nof the Myeloxylon type of rachis bearing Alethopteroid pinnules.\r\n\r\nThe constant association of the fronds of _Alethopteris lonchitica_\r\nand _Trigonocarpon_ seeds noticed by Mr Hemingway in the Coal-Measures\r\nof Yorkshire led him to regard the species as seed-bearing: it has\r\nsince been recognised as the foliage of the Pteridosperm _Medullosa\r\nanglica_[1571].\r\n\r\nGrand’Eury[1572] has recorded the association in French Coal-fields of\r\nspecies of _Alethopteris_ with _Trigonocarpon_ and _Pachytesta_ seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alethopteris lonchitica_ (Schlotheim)[1573]. Figs. 364, A; 290, A.\r\n\r\nThis species, described by Schlotheim in 1820 as _Filicites\r\nlonchiticus_ and previously figured by Scheuchzer[1574], is abundant\r\nin the Middle and Lower Coal-Measures of Britain[1575]. It is\r\ncharacterised by large tripinnate fronds, probably quadripinnate in the\r\nlower part, bearing primary pinnae of a more or less triangular form\r\ndivided into pinnate branches replaced in the apical region by linear\r\nsegments. The pinnules, 8–30 mm. long and 3–5 broad, are linear- or\r\noval-lanceolate with an obtuse apex; the upper margin of the lamina is\r\nslightly contracted at the base, while the lower edge is decurrent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 375. _Alethopteris Serlii_ (Brongn.). From a\r\n  specimen in the York Museum. ¾ nat. size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alethopteris Serlii_ (Brongniart)[1576]. Fig. 375.\r\n\r\nThis species, figured by Parkinson in 1811, closely resembles _A.\r\nlonchitica_, but is distinguished by the more crowded and relatively\r\nlonger pinnules which are joined to one another by a narrow connecting\r\nlamina (Fig. 375). The secondary veins in _A. Serlii_ are rather finer\r\nand more numerous. Grand’Eury[1577] records the association of the seed\r\n_Pachytesta_ with fronds of this species in the Coal-Measures of St\r\nÉtienne.\r\n\r\n_A. Serlii_ is very abundant in the Upper Coal-Measures but rare in\r\nthe Middle Coal-Measures of Britain[1578].\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Lonchopteris.\r\n\r\nThis name was proposed by Brongniart[1579] for sterile fronds from\r\nUpper Carboniferous rocks which are practically identical with\r\nspecies of _Alethopteris_, but differ in the reticulate venation of\r\nthe pinnules. It has been pointed out in a previous chapter[1580]\r\nthat _Lonchopteris_ is usually used for Palaeozoic species, the\r\nWealden leaves, which were placed in this genus by Brongniart, being\r\ntransferred to _Weichselia_.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt as to the close relationship of\r\n_Lonchopteris_ with _Alethopteris_: both may be referred to the\r\nPteridosperms. _Lonchopteris rugosa_ Brongn.[1581] (fig. 290, B, p.\r\n399) and _L. Bricei_ Brongn., both British species, are fairly common\r\nin Upper Carboniferous strata. In _L. rugosa_, a Middle Coal-Measures\r\nspecies, the anastomosing secondary veins form polygonal meshes (fig.\r\n290, B, p. 399) smaller than those of _L. Bricei_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Pecopteris.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to this genus in the chapter on\r\nMarattiales, so far as regards certain species of fertile fronds the\r\nsporangia of which resemble those of recent Marattiaceae. It is,\r\nhowever, by no means safe to assume that such Pecopteris fronds were\r\nborne on stems having the anatomical characters of ferns. The sporangia\r\nin some at least of the species may have contained microspores. In\r\none Upper Carboniferous species usually referred to Pecopteris, _P.\r\nPluckeneti_, Schlot., Grand’Eury[1582] has recorded the occurrence of\r\nseeds on the pinnules of the ordinary fronds. This species will be\r\nreferred to in Volume III. The substitution of such generic names as\r\n_Ptychocarpus_, _Asterotheca_, _Hawlea_, _Dactylotheca_ and others\r\nfor the purely provisional designation _Pecopteris_ indicates a step\r\ntowards a conclusion as to natural affinity. The probability is that\r\n_Pecopteris_, as applied to Palaeozoic species, in many cases stands\r\nfor the compound fronds of true ferns, but the possibility of the\r\ninclusion of those of Pteridosperms in the same category is by no means\r\nexcluded. The designation _Pecopteris_ may conveniently be retained for\r\nsterile bipinnate, tripinnate, or quadripinnate fronds bearing pinnules\r\nhaving the following characteristics:\r\n\r\n  Lamina short, attached to the rachis by the whole of the base and\r\n  at a wide angle, with the edges parallel or slightly converging\r\n  towards the usually blunt apex; adjacent pinnules may be continuous\r\n  basally by a narrow lamina. A well-marked midrib extends to the\r\n  apex and gives off simple or forked lateral veins almost at right\r\n  angles (fig. 352, D, p. 529).\r\n\r\n  Hydathodes like those on the leaflets of _Polypodium vulgare_ and\r\n  other recent ferns[1583] are occasionally seen at the ends of the\r\n  lateral veins of Pecopteris pinnules.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the examples of Palaeozoic fronds with the _Pecopteris_\r\nform of pinnule referred to in chapter XXII., the species _Pecopteris\r\narborescens_ may be briefly described.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pecopteris arborescens_ (Schlotheim)[1584]. Figs. 352, D: 376.\r\n\r\nThe species named by Schlotheim _Filicites arborescens_ in 1804 is\r\ncharacteristic of the Upper Coal-Measures and is recorded also from\r\nPermian strata[1585].\r\n\r\n  Fronds large; the rachis, which may reach a breadth of 3 cm.[1586],\r\n  gives off long ovoid-lanceolate pinnae in two alternate rows\r\n  (fig. 376); pinnules small, 1·5–4mm. long and 1–2mm. broad,\r\n  contiguous, with rounded apex, attached approximately at right\r\n  angles; the upper surface of the lamina is slightly convex and may\r\n  be hairy[1587]. The fertile pinnules, identical in shape with the\r\n  sterile, bear groups of ovoid exannulate sporangia (synangia). The\r\n  midrib extends to the apex of the pinnule and gives off simple\r\n  veins at a wide angle (fig. 352, D).\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the reproductive organs is very meagre. Grand’Eury\r\ndescribed the synangia as consisting of 3–5 sporangia borne on a\r\ncentral receptacle; sporangia have been described also by Stur[1588],\r\nRenault and Zeiller[1589], and Potonié[1590], but no fertile British\r\nspecimens are recorded. Stur places this species in the genus\r\n_Scolecopteris_, and Potonié regards the sporangia found by him on\r\nPermian fronds, which may be identical with _Pecopteris arborescens_,\r\nas conforming to those of the _Asterotheca_ type. It is impossible to\r\ndecide on the evidence available whether this species is a Pteridosperm\r\nor a fern, but there is a natural inclination in doubtful cases to give\r\npreference to the first of these two choices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 376. _Pecopteris arborescens_ (Schloth.). From\r\n  the Upper Coal-Measures of Radstock. From a photograph by Dr\r\n  Kidston. Reduced.]\r\n\r\nThe numerous fronds from Carboniferous and Permian rocks described\r\nas species of _Pecopteris_ exhibit a considerable range of variation\r\nin the form of the pinnules. In many species the pinnules are of the\r\ntype represented in fig. 352, D; in others the lamina of the ultimate\r\nsegments is slightly contracted at the base and the secondary veins\r\nare given off at a more acute angle, as in _Pecopteris polymorpha_,\r\nBrongn.[1591] In _Pecopteris unita_, Brongn., already described as\r\n_Ptychocarpus unita_[1592], the pinnules are joined together except\r\nin the apical region. Some fronds included in _Pecopteris_ possess\r\npinnules in which Pecopteroid and Sphenopteroid features are combined;\r\n_P. Sterzeli_, Zeill.[1593] and _P. Pluckeneti_, Schlot. are examples\r\nof fronds in which the pinnules are lobed as in _Sphenopteris_, but the\r\nbase of the lamina is only slightly contracted and the venation is not\r\nthat of typical Sphenopteris species.\r\n\r\nThe species to which Potonié has applied the generic name\r\n_Alloiopteris_[1594] also illustrates the impossibility of drawing a\r\nsharp line between _Pecopteris_ and _Sphenopteris_. The fronds already\r\ndescribed in chapter XXV. under the designation _Corynepteris_ bear\r\npinnules with a contracted base; in some species the lamina is lobed,\r\nbut in others (fig. 354, G) it is entire with a midrib nearer one edge\r\nthan the other. The species which Potonié assigns to _Alloiopteris_,\r\nlike many other Sphenopteroid and Pecopteroid fronds, are characterised\r\nby the occurrence of an abnormal pinnule (aphlebia) at the base of\r\neach pinna (fig. 354, G, p. 535). Young fronds of _Pecopteris_ are\r\noccasionally met with showing very clearly the circinate vernation of\r\nthe pinnae as in the leaves of _Cycas_ and _Angiopteris_ represented in\r\nfig. 220, p. 283. The genus _Spiropteris_ was created by Schimper[1595]\r\nfor coiled unexpanded fronds of fossil ferns; it is however superfluous\r\nto apply a distinctive term to specimens of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe designation _Pecopteris_ is employed chiefly for leaves of\r\nPalaeozoic age which are unknown in the fertile state, or do not afford\r\nsufficient evidence as to the nature of the sporangia to justify the\r\nsubstitution of a special generic name. Many Mesozoic species have also\r\nbeen referred to _Pecopteris_, but most of these are more appropriately\r\nincluded in Brongniart’s later genus _Cladophlebis_. The pinnules of\r\n_Cladophlebis_, as Brongniart pointed out, are intermediate between\r\n_Pecopteris_ and _Neuropteris_; they are usually attached by the whole\r\nbreadth of the base, as in _Pecopteris_, but the more acute origin,\r\nmore arched form, and more frequent dichotomy of the lateral veins\r\nare features shared by _Neuropteris_. As a rule, Mesozoic sterile\r\nfronds with straight or folded, entire or dentate pinnules are of the\r\nCladophlebis type: this genus is especially characteristic of Rhaetic\r\nand Jurassic floras. Examples of _Cladophlebis_ pinnules are shown in\r\nfigs. 256, 257 (pp. 340, 342). It is to be regretted that authors do\r\nnot make more use of the generic name _Cladophlebis_ in describing\r\nsterile fronds, instead of following the misleading and unscientific\r\npractice of employing such genera as _Pteris_, _Asplenites_, and others\r\non wholly insufficient grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                LIST OF WORKS REFERRED TO IN THE TEXT.\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Amalitzky, W.= (01) Sur la découverte, dans les dépôts permiens\r\n        supérieurs du Nord de la Russie, d’une flore Glossoptérienne\r\n        &c. _Compt.

HAMILTON ACTON, M.A. Crown 8vo. With 45 illustrations. _Third\r\n    edition._ 4_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\n_Nature._ The authors are much to be congratulated on their work, which\r\nfills a serious gap in the botanical literature of this country.\r\n\r\n=Morphology and Anthropology.= By W. L. H. DUCKWORTH, M.A., M.D.,\r\n    Fellow and Lecturer of Jesus College, University Lecturer in\r\n    Physical Anthropology. Demy 8vo. With 333 illustrations. 15_s. net._\r\n\r\n_Athenæum._ Mr Duckworth has managed to produce in his “Morphology and\r\nAnthropology” just such a text-book as students have long been asking\r\nfor.... It is no easy task to have undertaken such a work and the\r\nauthor is to be congratulated on the success which has attended his\r\nefforts. The volume can be confidently recommended to all whose studies\r\nlead them in this direction.\r\n\r\n=Lectures on the History of Physiology= during the Sixteenth,\r\n    Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries. By Sir M. FOSTER, K.C.B.,\r\n    M.D., D.C.L. Demy 8vo. With a frontispiece. 9_s._\r\n\r\n_Nature._ There is no more fascinating chapter in the history of\r\nscience than that which deals with physiology, but a concise and at\r\nthe same time compendious account of the early history of the subject\r\nhas never before been presented to the English reader. Physiologists\r\ntherefore owe a debt of gratitude to Sir Michael Foster for supplying\r\na want which was widely felt.... No higher praise can be given to the\r\nbook than to say that it is worthy of the reputation of its author.\r\n\r\n=The Soluble Ferments and Fermentation.= By J. REYNOLDS GREEN, Sc.D.,\r\n    F.R.S., Professor of Botany to the Pharmaceutical Society of Great\r\n    Britain. _Second edition._ Demy 8vo. 12_s._\r\n\r\n_Nature._ It is not necessary to recommend the perusal of the book to\r\nall interested in the subject since it is indispensable to them, and\r\nwe will merely conclude by congratulating the Cambridge University\r\nPress on having added to their admirable series of Natural Science\r\nManuals an eminently successful work on so important and difficult a\r\ntheme, and the author on having written a treatise cleverly conceived,\r\nindustriously and ably worked out, and on the whole, well written.\r\n\r\n=A Treatise on the British Freshwater Algæ.= By G. S. WEST, M.A.,\r\n    A.R.C.S., F.L.S., Lecturer in Botany in the University of\r\n    Birmingham. Demy 8vo. With a frontispiece and 166 illustrations.\r\n    10_s._ 6_d._ _net_.\r\n\r\n_Nature._ Its aim is stated as “to give the student a concise account\r\nof the structure, habits and life-histories of Freshwater Algæ, and\r\nalso to enable him to place within the prescribed limits of a genus\r\nany Algæ he may find in the freshwater of the British Islands.” To do\r\nthis within the limits of an octavo volume of less than 400 pages, in\r\nwhich are numerous illustrations, is a task possible of accomplishment\r\nonly by one very familiar with the subject and skilled in concise\r\nexpression; but that it has been successfully done will, we think,\r\nbe the verdict after testing the book thoroughly.... Prof. West’s\r\ntreatment of his subject is instructive and stimulating.\r\n\r\n=A Manual and Dictionary of the Flowering Plants and Ferns.= By J. C.\r\n    WILLIS, M.A., Sc.D., Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Ceylon.\r\n    _Third edition._ Crown 8vo. 10_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\n_Field._ Taking this handy volume and a local flora, the traveller\r\nor student may do an enormous amount of practical field work without\r\nany other botanical literature whatever.... The result is a work that\r\nought to be included in every library of botany and horticulture or\r\nagriculture, and it is certainly one that the nomadic botanist cannot\r\nafford to leave at home.... We have used the original edition of this\r\nwork since its publication, and have found it to be one of the most\r\nuseful and comprehensive works on plants ever produced.\r\n\r\n_Athenæum._ The whole is well abreast of modern research, and a\r\nthoroughly business-like volume, lucid though compact.\r\n\r\n=Agriculture in the Tropics.= An elementary Treatise. By J. C. WILLIS,\r\n    M.A., Sc.D. Demy 8vo. With 25 plates. 7_s._ 6_d._ _net._\r\n\r\n=Palæontology—Invertebrate.= By HENRY WOODS, M.A., F.G.S., University\r\n    Lecturer in Palæozoology.

Demy 8vo. With 228 illustrations.\r\n    14_s._\r\n\r\n_Athenæum._ The author is to be congratulated on having produced a work\r\nof exceptional value, dealing with a difficult subject in a thoroughly\r\nsound manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS\r\n                      ~London~: FETTER LANE, E.C.\r\n                          C.
