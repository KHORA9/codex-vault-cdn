Flossie! Look at me! I'm having a steamboat ride! Oh, look!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am looking, Freddie Bobbsey!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you're not! You're playing with your doll! Look at me splash,\r\nFlossie!\"\r\n\r\nA little boy with blue eyes and light, curling hair was standing on a\r\nraft in the middle of a shallow pond of water left in a green meadow\r\nafter a heavy rain. In his hand he held a long pole with which he was\r\nbeating the water, making a shower of drops that sparkled in the sun.\r\n\r\nOn the shore of the pond, not far away, and sitting under an apple tree,\r\nwas a little girl with the same sort of light hair and blue eyes as\r\nthose which made the little boy such a pretty picture. Both children\r\nwere fat and chubby, and you would have needed but one look to tell that\r\nthey were twins.\r\n\r\n\"Now I'm going to sail away across the ocean!\" cried Freddie Bobbsey,\r\nthe little boy on the raft, which he and his sister Flossie had made\r\nthat morning by piling a lot of old boards and fence rails together.\r\n\"Don't you want to sail across the ocean, Flossie?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I'll fall off!\" answered Flossie, who was holding her doll\r\noff at arm's length to see how pretty her new blue dress looked. \"I\r\nmight fall in the water and get my feet wet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take off your shoes and stockings like I did, Flossie,\" said the little\r\nboy.\r\n\r\n\"Is it very deep?\" Flossie wanted to know, as she laid aside her doll.\r\nAfter all she could play with her doll any day, but it was not always\r\nthat she could have a ride on a raft with Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered the little blue-eyed boy. \"It isn't deep at all. That is,\r\nI don't guess it is, but I didn't fall in yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to fall in,\" said Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I won't let you,\" promised her brother, though how he was going\r\nto manage that he did not say. \"I'll come back and get you on the\r\nsteamboat,\" he went on, \"and then I'll give you a ride all across the\r\nocean,\" and he began pushing the raft, which he pretended was a\r\nsteamboat, back toward the shore where his sister sat.\r\n\r\nFlossie was now taking off her shoes and stockings, which Freddie had\r\ndone before he got on the raft; and it was a good thing, too, for the\r\nwater splashed up over it as far as his ankles, and his shoes would\r\nsurely have been wet had he kept them on.\r\n\r\n\"Whoa, there! Stop!\" cried Flossie, as she came down to the edge of the\r\npond, after having placed her doll, in its new blue dress, safely in the\r\nshade under a big burdock plant. \"Whoa, there, steamboat! Whoa!\"\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't say 'whoa' to a boat!\" objected Freddie, as he pushed the\r\nraft close to the bank, so his sister could get on. \"You only say 'whoa'\r\nto a horse or a pony.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you say it to a goat?\" demanded Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, maybe you could say it to a goat,\" Freddie agreed, after thinking\r\nabout it for a little while. \"But you can't say it to a boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I wanted you to stop, so you wouldn't bump into the shore,\" said\r\nthe little girl. \"That's why I said 'whoa.'\"\r\n\r\n\"But you mustn't say it to a boat, and this raft is the same as a boat,\"\r\ninsisted Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"What must I say, then, when I want it to stop?\"\r\n\r\nFreddie thought about this for a moment or two while he paddled his bare\r\nfoot in the water. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, you could say 'Halt!' maybe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pooh! 'Halt' is what you say to soldiers,\" declared Flossie. \"We said\r\nthat when we had a snow fort, and played have a snowball fight in the\r\nwinter. 'Halt' is only for soldiers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, come on and have a ride,\" went on Freddie. \"I forget what you\r\nsay when you want a boat to stop.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know!\" cried Flossie, clapping her hands.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"You just blow a whistle. You don't say anything. You just go 'Toot!\r\nToot!' and the boat stops.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" agreed Freddie, glad that this part was settled. \"When you\r\nwant this boat to stop, you just whistle.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" said Flossie. Then she stepped on the edge of the raft nearest\r\nthe shore. The boards and rails tilted to one side. \"Oh! Oh!\" screamed\r\nthe little girl. \"It's sinking!\"\r\n\r\n\"No it isn't,\" Freddie said. \"It always does that when you first get on.\r\nCome on out in the middle and it will be all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it feels so--so funny on my toes!\" said Flossie, with a little\r\nshiver. \"It's tickly like.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the way it was with me at first,\" Freddie answered. \"But I like\r\nit now.\"\r\n\r\nFlossie wiggled her little pink toes in the water that washed up over\r\nthe top of the raft, and then she said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, I--I guess I like it too, now. But it felt sort of--sort\r\nof--squiggily at first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Squiggily\" was a word Flossie and Freddie sometimes used when they\r\ndidn't know else to say.\r\n\r\nThe little girl moved over to the middle of the raft and Freddie began\r\nto push it out from shore. The rain-water pond was quite a large one,\r\nand was deep in places, but the children did not know this. When they\r\nwere both in the center of the raft the water came only a little way\r\nover their feet. Indeed there were so many boards, planks and rails in\r\nthe make-believe steamboat that it would easily have held more than the\r\ntwo smaller Bobbsey twins. For there was a double set of twins, as I\r\nshall very soon tell you.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't this nice?\" asked Freddie, as he pushed the pretend boat farther\r\nout toward the middle of the pond.\r\n\r\n\"Awful nice--I like it,\" said Flossie. \"I'm glad I helped you make this\r\nraft.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a steamboat,\" said Freddie. \"It isn't a raft.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, steamboat, then,\" agreed Flossie. Then she suddenly went:\r\n\r\n\"Toot! Toot!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here! what you blowin' the whistle now for?\" asked Freddie. \"We don't\r\nwant to stop here, right in the middle of the ocean.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I was only just trying my whistle to see if it would toot,\"\r\nexplained the little girl. \"I don't want to stop now.\"\r\n\r\nFlossie walked around the middle of the raft, making the water splash\r\nwith her bare feet, and Freddie kept on pushing it farther and farther\r\nfrom shore. Yet Flossie was not afraid. Perhaps she felt that Freddie\r\nwould take care of her.\r\n\r\nThe little Bobbsey twins were having lots of fun, pretending they were\r\non a steamboat, when they heard some one shouting to them from the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n\"Hi there! Come and get us!\" someone was calling to them.\r\n\r\n\"Who is it?\" asked Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"It's Bert; and Nan is with him,\" answered Flossie, as she saw a larger\r\nboy and girl standing on the bank, near the tree under which she had\r\nleft her doll. \"I guess they want a ride. Is the raft big enough for\r\nthem too, Freddie?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I guess so,\" he answered. \"You stop the steamboat, Flossie--and\r\nstop calling it a raft--and I'll go back and get them. We'll pretend\r\nthey're passengers. Stop the boat!\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I stop the boat?\" the little girl demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Toot the whistle! Toot the whistle!\" answered her brother. \"Don't you\r\n'member, Flossie Bobbsey?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said Flossie. Then she went on:\r\n\r\n\"Toot! Toot!\"\r\n\r\n\"Toot! Toot!\" answered Freddie. He began pushing the other way on the\r\npole and the raft started back toward the shore they had left.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing?\" asked Bert Bobbsey, as the mass of boards and\r\nrails came closer to him. \"What are you two playing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Steamboat,\" Freddie answered. \"If you want us to stop for you, why,\r\nyou've got to toot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Toot what?\" asked Bert.\r\n\r\n\"Toot your whistle,\" Freddie replied. \"This is a regular steamboat. Toot\r\nif you want me to stop.\"\r\n\r\nHe kept on pushing with the pole until Bert, with a laugh, made the\r\ntooting sound as Flossie had done. Then Freddie let the raft stop near\r\nhis older brother and sister.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Bert!\" exclaimed Nan Bobbsey, \"are you going to get on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure I am,\" he answered, as he began taking off his shoes and\r\nstockings. \"It's big enough for the four of us. Where'd you get it,\r\nFreddie?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was partly made--I guess some of the boys from town must have\r\nstarted it. Flossie and I put more boards and rails on it, and we're\r\nhaving a ride.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say you were!\" laughed Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" said Bert to his older sister, as he tossed his shoes over to\r\nwhere Flossie's and Freddie's were set on a flat stone. \"I'll help you\r\npush, Freddie.\"\r\n\r\nNan, who, like Bert, had dark hair and brown eyes, began to take off her\r\nshoes and stockings, and soon all four of them were on the raft--or\r\nsteamboat, as Freddie called it.\r\n\r\nNow you have met the two sets of the Bobbsey twins--two pairs of them as\r\nit were. Flossie and Freddie, the light-haired and blue-eyed ones, were\r\nthe younger set, and Bert and Nan, whose hair was a dark brown, matching\r\ntheir eyes, were the older.\r\n\r\n\"This is a dandy raft--I mean steamboat,\" said Bert, quickly changing\r\nthe word as he saw Freddie looking at him. \"It holds the four of us\r\neasy.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed the mass of boards, planks and rails from the fence did not sink\r\nvery deep in the water even with all the Bobbsey twins on it. Of course,\r\nif they had worn shoes and stockings they would have been wet, for now\r\nthe water came up over the ankles of all of them. But it was a warm\r\nsummer day, and going barefoot especially while wading in the pond, was\r\nfun.\r\n\r\nBert and Freddie pushed the raft about with long poles, and Flossie and\r\nNan stood together in the middle watching the boys and making believe\r\nthey were passengers taking a voyage across the ocean.\r\n\r\nBack and forth across the pond went the raft-steamboat when, all of a\r\nsudden, it stopped with a jerk in the middle of the stretch of water.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" cried Flossie, catching hold of Nan to keep herself from falling.\r\n\"Oh, what's the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we sinking?\" asked Nan.\r\n\r\n\"No, we're only stuck in the mud,\" Bert answered. \"You just stay there,\r\nFlossie and Nan, and you, too, Freddie, and I'll jump off and push the\r\nboat out of the mud. It's just stuck, that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't jump in--it's deep!\" cried Nan.\r\n\r\nBut she was too late. Bert, quickly rolling his trousers up as far as\r\nthey would go, had leaped off the raft, making a big splash of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTO THE RESCUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Bert! Bert! You'll be drowned!\" cried Flossie, as she clung to Nan in\r\nthe middle of the raft. \"Come back, you'll be drowned!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm all right,\" Bert answered, for he felt himself quite a big boy\r\nbeside Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure, Bert, it isn't too deep?\" asked Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Look! It doesn't come up to my knees, hardly,\" Bert said, as he waded\r\naround to the side of the raft, having jumped off one end to give it a\r\npush to get it loose from the bank of mud on which it had run aground.\r\nAnd, really, the water was not very deep where Bert had leaped in.\r\n\r\nSome water had splashed on his short trousers, but he did not mind that,\r\nas they were the old ones his mother made him put on in which to play.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe we can get loose without your pushing us,\" said Freddie, as he\r\nmoved about on the raft, tilting it a little, first this way and then\r\nthe other. Once before that day, when on the \"boat\" alone, it had become\r\nstuck on a hidden bank of mud, and the little twin had managed to get it\r\nloose himself.\r\n\r\n\"No, I guess it's stuck fast,\" Bert said, as he pushed on the mass of\r\nboards without being able to send them adrift. \"I'll have to shove good\r\nand hard, and maybe you'll have to get in here and help me, Freddie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I can do that!\" the little fellow said. \"I'll come and help\r\nyou now, Bert.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you mustn't,\" ordered Nan, who felt that she had to be a little\r\nmother to the smaller twins. \"Don't go!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" Freddie wanted to know.\r\n\r\n\"Because it's too deep for you,\" answered Nan. \"The water is only up to\r\nBert's knees, but it will be over yours, and you'll get your clothes all\r\nwet. You stay here!\"\r\n\r\n\"But I want to help Bert push the steamboat loose!\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess I can do it alone,\" Bert said. \"Wait until I get around to the\r\nfront end. I'll push it off backward.\"\r\n\r\nHe waded around the raft, which it really was, though the Bobbsey twins\r\npretended it was a steamboat, and then, reaching the front, or what\r\nwould be the bow if the raft had really been a boat, Bert got ready to\r\npush.\r\n\r\n\"Push, Bert!\" yelled Freddie.\r\n\r\nBut a strange thing happened.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a queer look came over Bert's face. He made a quick grab for\r\nthe side of the raft and then he sank down so that the water came over\r\nhis knees, wetting his trousers.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Bert! what's the matter?\" cried Nan.\r\n\r\n\"I--I'm sinking in the mud!\" gasped Bert. \"Oh, I can't get my feet\r\nloose! I'm stuck! Maybe I'm in a quicksand and I'll never get loose!\r\nHoller for somebody! Holler loud!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the other three Bobbsey twins \"hollered,\" as loudly as they could.\r\n\r\n\"Mother! Mother!\" cried Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Come and get Bert!\" added Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Dinah! Dinah!\" screamed Flossie, for the fat, good-natured colored\r\ncook had so often rescued Flossie that the little girl thought she would\r\nbe the very best person, now, to come to Bert's aid.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm sinking away down deep!\" cried the brown-eyed boy, as he tried\r\nto lift first one foot and then the other. But they were both stuck in\r\nthe mud under the water, and Bert, afraid of sinking so deep that he\r\nwould never get out, clung to the side of the raft with all his might.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you're making us sink. You're making us sink!\" screamed Nan.\r\nIndeed, the raft was tipping to one side and the other children had all\r\nthey could do to keep from sliding into the pond.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, somebody come and help me!\" called Bert.\r\n\r\nAnd then a welcome voice answered:\r\n\r\n\"I'm coming! I'm coming!\"\r\n\r\nSo, while some one is coming to the rescue, I will take just a few\r\nmoments to tell my new readers something about the children who are to\r\nhave adventures in this story.\r\n\r\nThose of you who have read the other books of the series will remember\r\nthat in the first volume, called \"The Bobbsey Twins,\" I told you of\r\nFlossie and Freddie, and Bert and Nan Bobbsey, who lived with their\r\nfather and mother in the eastern city of Lakeport, near Lake Metoka. Mr.\r\nRichard Bobbsey owned a large lumberyard, where the children were wont\r\noften to play. As I have mentioned, Flossie and Freddie, with their\r\nlight hair and blue eyes, were one set of twins--the younger--while Nan\r\nand Bert, who were just the opposite, being dark, were the older twins.\r\n\r\nThe children had many good times, about some of which I have told you in\r\nthe first book. Dinah Johnson, the fat, jolly cook, always saw to it\r\nthat the twins had plenty to eat, and her husband, Sam, who worked about\r\nthe place, made many a toy for the children, or mended those they broke.\r\nAlmost as a part of the family, as it were, I might mention Snap, the\r\ntrick dog, and Snoop, the cat. The children were very fond of these\r\npets.\r\n\r\nAfter having had much fun, as related in my first book, the Bobbsey\r\ntwins went to the country, where Uncle Daniel Bobbsey had a big farm at\r\nMeadow Brook. Later, as you will find in the third volume, they went to\r\nvisit Uncle William Minturn at the seashore.\r\n\r\nOf course, along with their good times, the children had to go to\r\nschool, and you will find one of the books telling what they did there,\r\nand the fun they had. From school the Bobbsey twins went to Snow Lodge,\r\nand then they spent some time on a houseboat and later again went to\r\nMeadow Brook for a jolly stay in the woods and fields near the farm.\r\n\r\n\"And now suppose we stay at home for a while,\" Mr. Bobbsey had said,\r\nafter coming back from Meadow Brook.\r\n\r\nAt first the twins thought they wouldn't like this very much, but they\r\ndid, and they had as much fun and almost as many adventures as before.\r\nAfter that they spent some time in a great city and then they got ready\r\nfor some wonderful adventures on Blueberry Island.\r\n\r\nThose adventures you will find told about in the book just before this\r\none you are now reading. The twins spent the summer on the island, and\r\nmany things happened to them, to their goat and dog, and to a queer boy.\r\nFreddie lost some of his \"go-around\" bugs, and there is something in the\r\nbook about a cave,--but I know you would rather read it for yourself\r\nthan have me tell you here.\r\n\r\nNow to get back to the children on the raft, or rather, to Flossie,\r\nFreddie and Nan, who are on that, while Bert is in the water, and stuck\r\nin the mud.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come quick! Come quick!\" he cried. \"I can't get loose!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm coming!\" answered the voice, and it was that of Mrs. Bobbsey. She\r\nhad been in the kitchen, telling Dinah what to get for dinner, when she\r\nheard the children shouting from down in the meadow, where the big pond\r\nof rain water was.\r\n\r\n\"I hope none of them has fallen in!\" said Mrs. Bobbsey as she ran out of\r\nthe door, after hearing Bert's shout.\r\n\r\n\"Good land ob massy! I hopes so mahse'f!\" gasped fat Dinah, and she,\r\ntoo, started for the pond. But, as she was very fat, she could not run\r\nas fast as could Mrs. Bobbsey. \"I 'clar' to goodness I hopes none ob 'em\r\nhas falled in de watah!\" murmured Dinah. \"Dat's whut I hopes!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Bobbsey reached the edge of the pond. She saw three of the twins on\r\nthe raft. For the moment she could not see Bert.\r\n\r\n\"Where is Bert?\" she cried.\r\n\r\n\"Here I am, Mother!\" he answered.\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Bobbsey saw him standing in the water, which was now well over\r\nhis knees. He was holding to the edge of the raft.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Bert Bobbsey!\" his mother called. \"What are you doing there? Come\r\nright out this instant! Why, you are all wet! Oh, my dear!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't come out, Mother,\" said Bert, who was not so frightened, now\r\nthat he saw help at hand.\r\n\r\n\"You can't come out? Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Cause I'm stuck in the mud--or maybe it's quicksand. I'm sinking in\r\nthe quicksand. Or I would sink if I didn't keep hold of the raft. I\r\ndassn't let go!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my!\" cried Mrs. Bobbsey. \"What shall I do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you pull him out?\" asked Nan. \"We tried, but we can't.\"\r\n\r\nThey had done this--she and Flossie and Freddie. But Bert's feet were\r\ntoo tightly held in the sticky mud, or whatever it was underneath the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"Wait! I'll come and get you,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey. She was just about to\r\nwade out to get Bert, shoes, skirts and all, when along came puffing,\r\nfat Dinah, and, just ahead of her, her husband, Sam.\r\n\r\n\"What's the mattah, Mrs. Bobbsey?\" asked the colored man, who did odd\r\njobs around the Bobbsey home.\r\n\r\n\"It's Bert! He's fast in the mud!\" answered Mrs. Bobbsey. \"Oh, Sam,\r\nplease hurry and get him out!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yas'am, I'll do dat!\" cried Sam. He did not seem to be frightened.\r\nPerhaps he knew that the pond was not very deep where Bert was, and that\r\nthe boy could not sink down much farther.\r\n\r\nSam had been washing the automobile with the hose, and when he did this\r\nhe always wore his rubber boots. He had them on now, and so he could\r\neasily wade out into the pond without getting wet.\r\n\r\nSo out Sam waded, half running in fact, and splashing the water all\r\nabout. But he did not mind that. As did Dinah, he loved the Bobbsey\r\ntwins--all four of them--and he did not want anything to happen to them.\r\n\r\n\"Jest you stand right fast, Bert!\" said the colored man. \"I'll have yo'\r\nout ob dere in 'bout two jerks ob a lamb's tail! Dat's what I will!\"\r\n\r\nBert did not know just how long it took to jerk a lamb's tail twice,\r\neven if a lamb had been there. But it did not take Sam very long to\r\nreach the small boy.\r\n\r\n\"Now den, heah we go!\" cried Sam.\r\n\r\nStanding beside the raft, the colored man put his arms around Bert and\r\nlifted him. Or rather, he tried to lift him, for the truth of the matter\r\nwas that Bert was stuck deeper in the mud than any one knew.\r\n\r\n\"Now, heah we go, _suah!_\" cried Sam, as he took a tighter hold and\r\nlifted harder. And then with a jerk, Bert came loose and up out of the\r\nwater he was lifted, his feet and legs dripping with black mud, some of\r\nwhich splashed on Sam and on the other twins.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what a sight you are!\" cried Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but good land of massy! Ain't yo' all thankful he ain't all\r\n_drown?_\" asked Dinah.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I am,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey. \"Come on away from there, all of you.\r\nGet off the raft! I'm afraid it's too dangerous to play that game. And,\r\nBert, you must get washed! Oh, how dirty you are!\"\r\n\r\nSam carried Bert to shore, and Nan helped Freddie push the raft to the\r\nedge of the pond. And then along came Mr. Bobbsey from his lumberyard.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well!\" exclaimed the father of the Bobbsey twins. \"What has\r\nhappened?\"\r\n\r\n\"We had a raft,\" explained Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"And I had to toot the whistle when I wanted it to stop,\" added Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"We were having a nice ride,\" said Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but what happened to Bert?\" asked his father, looking at his muddy\r\nson, who truly was a \"sight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the raft got stuck,\" Bert answered, \"and I got off to push it\r\nloose. Then I got stuck. It was awful sticky mud. I didn't know there\r\nwas any so sticky in the whole world! First I thought it was quicksand.\r\nBut I held on and then Sam came and got me out. I--I guess I got my\r\npants a little muddy,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I guess you did,\" agreed his father, and his eyes twinkled as they\r\nalways did when he wanted to laugh but did not feel that it would be\r\njust the right thing to do. \"You are wet and muddy. But get up to the\r\nhouse and put on dry things. Then I have something to tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Something to tell us?\" echoed Nan. \"Oh, Daddy! are we going away\r\nagain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm not sure about that part--yet,\" replied Mr. Bobbsey. \"But I\r\nhave strange news for you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nSTRANGE NEWS\r\n\r\n\r\nBert and Nan Bobbsey looked at one another. They were a little older\r\nthan Flossie and Freddie, and they saw that something must have happened\r\nto make their father come home from the lumber office so early, for on\r\nmost days he did not come until dinner time. And here it was scarcely\r\neleven o'clock yet, and Dinah was only getting ready to cook the dinner.\r\n\r\n\"Is it bad news?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey of her husband.\r\n\r\n\"Well, part of it is bad,\" he said. \"But no one is hurt, or killed or\r\nanything like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell us now!\" begged Bert. \"Tell us the strange news, Daddy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I couldn't think of it while you look the way you do,\" said Mr.\r\nBobbsey. \"First get washed nice and clean, and put on dry clothes. Then\r\nyou'll be ready for the news.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll hurry,\" promised Bert, as he ran toward the house, followed by\r\nSnap, the trick dog that had once been in a circus. Snap had come out of\r\nthe barn, where he stayed a good part of the time. He wanted to see what\r\nall the noise was about when Bert had called as he found himself stuck\r\nin the mud.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure no one is hurt?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey of her husband. \"Are\r\nUncle Daniel and Aunt Sarah all right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Uncle William and Aunt Emily?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they're all right, too. My news is about my cousin, Jasper Dent.\r\nYou don't know him very well; but I did, when I was a boy,\" went on Mr\r\nBobbsey. \"There is a little bad news about him. He has been hurt and is\r\nnow ill in a hospital, but he is getting well.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is the strange news about him?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey, as she walked\r\non, with Flossie, Freddie and Nan following.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, about Cousin Jasper,\" replied Mr. Bobbsey. \"But don't get worried,\r\neven if we should have to go on a voyage.\"\r\n\r\n\"On a voyage?\" cried Mrs. Bobbsey in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" and Mr. Bobbsey smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean in a real ship, like we played our raft was?\" asked\r\nFreddie.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my little fireman!\" laughed Mr. Bobbsey, catching the little\r\nbare-footed boy up in his arms. Often Freddie was called little\r\n\"fireman,\" for he had a toy fire engine, and he was very fond of\r\nsquirting water through the hose fastened to it--a real hose that\r\nsprinkled real water. Freddie was very fond of playing he was a fireman.\r\n\r\n\"And will the ship go on the ocean?\" asked Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my little fat fairy!\" her father replied, as he caught her up and\r\nkissed her in turn.\r\n\r\n\"If your mother thinks we ought to, after I tell the strange news about\r\nCousin Jasper, we may all take a trip on the deep blue sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what fun!\" cried Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"I hope we can go soon,\" murmured Nan.\r\n\r\n\"But Bert mustn't get off the ship to push it; must he, Daddy?\" asked\r\nFlossie.\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed!\" laughed her father, as he set her down in the grass. \"If\r\nhe does the water will come up more than above his knees. But now please\r\ndon't ask me any more questions until I can sit down after dinner and\r\ntell you the whole story.\"\r\n\r\nThe children thought the dinner never would be finished, and Bert, who\r\nhad put on dry clothes, tried to hurry through with his food.\r\n\r\n\"Bert, my dear, you must not eat so fast,\" remonstrated his mother, as\r\nshe saw him hurrying.\r\n\r\n\"Bert is eating like a regular steam engine,\" came from Flossie.\r\n\r\nAt this Nan burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Flossie, did you ever see an engine eat?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't care! You know what I mean,\" returned the little girl.\r\n\r\n\"Course engines eat!\" cried Freddie. \"Don't they eat piles of coal?\" he\r\nwent on triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, not an auto engine,\" said Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that eats up gasolene,\" said Bert.\r\n\r\nBut they were all in a hurry to listen to what their father might have\r\nto say, and so wasted no further time in argument. And when the rice\r\npudding was brought in Nan said:\r\n\r\n\"Dinner is over now, Daddy, for this is the dessert, and when you're in\r\na hurry to go back to the office you don't wait for that. So can't we\r\nhear the strange news now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I guess so,\" answered her father, and he drew from his pocket a\r\nletter. \"This came this morning,\" he said, \"and I thought it best to\r\ncome right home and tell you about it,\" he said to his wife.\r\n\r\n\"The letter is from my Cousin Jasper. When we were boys we lived in the\r\nsame town. Jasper was always fond of the ocean, and often said, when he\r\ngrew up, he would make a long voyage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Freddie and I were having a voyage on a raft to-day,\" said Flossie.\r\n\"And we had fun until Bert fell in.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't fall in--I jumped in and I got stuck in the mud,\" put in Bert.\r\n\r\n\"Don't interrupt, dears, if you want to hear Daddy's news,\" said Mrs.\r\nBobbsey, and her husband, after looking at the letter, as if to make\r\nsure about what he was talking, went on.\r\n\r\n\"Cousin Jasper Dent did become a sailor, when he grew up. But he sailed\r\nmore on steamboats than on ships with sails that have to be blown by the\r\nwind. Many things happened to him, so he has told me in letters that he\r\nhas written, for I have not seen him very often, of late years. And now\r\nthe strangest of all has happened, so he tells me here.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"Well, he has been shipwrecked, for one thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"And was he cast away on a desert island, like Robinson Crusoe?\" asked\r\nBert, who was old enough to read that wonderful book.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's what I don't know,\" went on Mr. Bobbsey. \"Cousin Jasper\r\ndoes not write all that happened to him. He says he has been shipwrecked\r\nand has had many adventures, and he wants me to come to him so that he\r\nmay tell me more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is he?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"In a hospital in St. Augustine, Florida,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Florida!\" exclaimed Flossie. \"That's where the cocoanuts grow;\r\nisn't it, Daddy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, maybe a few grow there, but I guess you are thinking of oranges,\"\r\nher father answered with a smile. \"Lots of oranges grow in Florida.\"\r\n\r\n\"And are we going there?\" asked Bert.\r\n\r\n\"That's what I want to talk to your mother about,\" went on Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\"Cousin Jasper doesn't say just what happened to him, nor why he is so\r\nanxious to see me. But he wants me to come down to Florida to see him.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be a nice trip if we could go, and take the children,\" said\r\nMrs. Bobbsey. \"Though, I suppose, this is hardly the time of year to go\r\nto such a place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it is always nice in Florida,\" her husband said, \"though of course\r\nwhen it is winter here it seems nicer there because it is so warm, and\r\nthe flowers are in blossom.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do the oranges grow then?\" asked Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"I guess so,\" his father said. \"At any rate it is now early spring here,\r\nand even in Florida, where it is warmer than it is up North where we\r\nlive, I think it will not be too hot for us. Besides, I don't believe\r\nCousin Jasper intends to stay in Florida, or have us stay there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" Mrs. Bobbsey asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, in his letter he says, after he has told me the strange news, he\r\nhopes I will go on a voyage with him to search for some one who is\r\nlost.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some one lost!\" replied Nan. \"What does he mean, Daddy?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I don't know. I guess Cousin Jasper was too ill to write\r\nall he wanted to, and he would rather see me and tell me. So I came to\r\nask if you would like to go to Florida,\" and Mr. Bobbsey looked at his\r\nwife and smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes! Let's go!\" begged Bert.\r\n\r\n\"And pick oranges!\" added Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"Please say you'll go, Mother!\" cried Nan. \"Please do!\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to go in big steamboat!\" fairly shouted Freddie. \"And I'll take\r\nmy fire engine with me and put out the fire!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, children dear, do be quiet one little minute and let me think,\"\r\nbegged Mrs. Bobbsey. \"Let me see the letter, dear,\" she said to her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nMr. Bobbsey handed his wife the sheets of paper, and she read them\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\n\"Well, they don't tell very much,\" she said as she folded them and\r\nhanded them back. \"Still your cousin does say something strange happened\r\nwhen he was shipwrecked, wherever that was. I think you had better go\r\nand see him, if you can leave the lumberyard, Dick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, the lumber business will be all right,\" said Mr. Bobbsey, whom\r\nhis wife called Dick. \"And would you like to go with me?\" he asked his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n\"And take the children?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we could take them. A sail on the ocean would do them good, I\r\nthink. They have been shut up pretty much all winter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will we go on a sailboat?\" asked Bert.\r\n\r\n\"No, I hardly think so. They are too slow. If we go we will, very\r\nlikely, go on a steamer,\" Mr. Bobbsey said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, goody!\" cried Freddie, while Mrs. Bobbsey smiled her consent.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, I'll call it settled,\" went on the twins' father, \"and I'll\r\nwrite Cousin Jasper that we're coming to hear his strange news, though\r\nwhy he couldn't put it in his letter I can't see. But maybe he had a\r\ngood reason. Now I'll go back to the office and see about getting ready\r\nfor a trip on the deep, blue sea. And I wonder----\"\r\n\r\nJust then, out in the yard, a loud noise sounded.\r\n\r\nSnap, the big dog, could be heard barking, and a child's voice cried:\r\n\r\n\"No, you can't have it! You can't have it! Oh, Nan! Bert! Make your dog\r\ngo 'way!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bobbsey, pushing back his chair so hard that it fell over, rushed\r\nfrom the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nGETTING READY\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear!\" cried Mrs. Bobbsey, \"I wonder what has happened now!\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe Snap is barking at a tramp,\" suggested Bert. \"I'll go and see.\"\r\n\r\n\"It can't be a tramp!\" Nan spoke with scorn. \"That sounded like a little\r\ngirl crying.\"\r\n\r\n\"It surely did,\" Mrs. Bobbsey said. \"Wait a minute, Bert. Don't go out\r\njust yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I want to see what it is, Mother!\" and Bert paused, half way to the\r\ndoor, out of which Mr. Bobbsey had hurried a few seconds before.\r\n\r\n\"Your father will do whatever needs to be done,\" said Bert's mother.\r\n\"Perhaps it may be a strange dog, fighting with Snap, and you might get\r\nbitten.\"\r\n\r\n\"Snap wouldn't bite me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor me!\" put in Nan.\r\n\r\n\"No, but the strange dog might. Wait a minute.\"\r\n\r\nFlossie and Freddie had also started to leave the room to go out into\r\nthe yard and see what was going on, but when they heard their mother\r\nspeak about a strange dog they went back to their chairs by the table.\r\n\r\nThen, from the yard, came cries of:\r\n\r\n\"Make him give her back to me, Mr. Bobbsey! Please make Snap give her\r\nback to me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's Helen Porter!\" cried Nan, as she heard the voice of a child.\r\n\"It's Helen, and Snap must have taken something she had.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see!\" exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey, looking out the door. \"It's Helen's\r\ndoll. Snap has it in his mouth and he's running with it down to the end\r\nof the yard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has Snap really got Helen's doll?\" asked Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered her mother. \"Though why he took it I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if it's only Snap, and no other dog is there, can't I go out and\r\nsee?\" asked Bert. \"Snap won't hurt me.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't believe he will,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey. \"Yes, you may all go\r\nout. I hope Snap hasn't hurt Helen.\"\r\n\r\nHelen Porter was a little girl who lived next door to the Bobbsey twins,\r\nand those of you who have the book about camping on Blueberry Island\r\nwill remember her as the child who, at first, was thought to have been\r\ntaken away by the Gypsies.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Helen! What is the matter, my dear?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey, as she\r\nhurried out into the yard, followed by Bert, Nan, Flossie and Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"Did Snap bite you?\" asked Nan, looking toward her father, who was\r\nrunning after the dog that was carrying the little girl's doll in his\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n\"No, Snap didn't bite me! But he bit my doll!\" Helen answered.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't hurt dolls to bite 'em,\" said Bert, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"It does so!\" cried Helen, turning her tear-filled eyes on him. \"It\r\nmakes all their sawdust come out!\"\r\n\r\n\"So it does, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey kindly. \"But we'll hope that\r\nSnap won't bite your doll as hard as that. If he does I'll sew up the\r\nholes to keep the sawdust in. But how did he come to do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I guess maybe he liked the cookie my doll had,\" explained Helen, who\r\nwas about as old as Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"Did your doll have a cookie?\" asked Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I was playing she was a rich lady doll,\" went on the little girl\r\nfrom next door, \"and she was taking a basket of cookies to a poor doll\r\nlady. Course I didn't have a whole basket of cookies,\" explained Helen.\r\n\"I had only one, but I made believe it was a whole basket full.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you give it to your doll to carry?\" asked Nan, for she had\r\noften played games this way herself, making believe different things.\r\n\"How did your doll carry the cookie, Helen?\"\r\n\r\n\"She didn't carry it,\" was the answer. \"I tied it to her with a piece of\r\nstring so she wouldn't lose it. The cookie was tied fast around her\r\nwaist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then I see what happened,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey. \"Snap came up to you,\r\nand he smelled the cookie on your doll; didn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes'm,\" answered Helen.\r\n\r\n\"And he must have thought you meant the cookie for him,\" went on Nan's\r\nmother. \"And he tried to take it in his mouth; didn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes'm,\" Helen answered again.\r\n\r\n\"And when he couldn't get the cookie loose, because you had it tied fast\r\nto your doll, he took the cookie, doll and all. That's how it was,\" said\r\nMrs. Bobbsey. \"Never mind, Helen. Don't cry. Here comes Mr. Bobbsey now,\r\nwith your doll.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I guess Snap has the cookie,\" said Bert with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"I'll get you another one from Dinah,\" promised Nan to Helen.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Mr. Bobbsey had run down to the lower end of the yard\r\nafter Snap, the big dog.\r\n\r\n\"Come here, Snap, you rascal!\" he cried. \"Come here this minute!\"\r\n\r\nBut for once Snap did not mind. He was rather hungry, and perhaps that\r\naccounted for his disobedience. Instead of coming up he ran out of sight\r\nbehind the little toolhouse. Mr. Bobbsey went after him, but by the time\r\nhe reached the spot Snap was nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\n\"Snap! Snap!\" he called out loudly. \"Come here, I tell you! Where are\r\nyou hiding?\"\r\n\r\nOf course, the dog could not answer the question that had been put to\r\nhim, and neither did he show himself. That is, not at first. But\r\npresently, as Mr. Bobbsey looked first in one corner of the toolhouse\r\nand then in another, he saw the tip end of Snap's tail waving slightly\r\nfrom behind a big barrel.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, so there you are!\" he called out, and then pushed the barrel to one\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThere was Snap, and in front of him lay the doll with a short string\r\nattached to it. Whatever had been tied to the other end of the string\r\nwas now missing.\r\n\r\n\"Snap, you're getting to be a bad dog!\" said Mr. Bobbsey sternly. \"Give\r\nme that doll this instant!\"\r\n\r\nThe dog made no movement to keep the doll, but simply licked his mouth\r\nwith his long, red tongue, as if he was still enjoying what he had\r\neaten.\r\n\r\n\"If you don't behave yourself after this I'll have to tie you up, Snap,\"\r\nwarned Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\nAnd then, acting as if he knew he had done wrong, the big dog slunk out\r\nof sight.\r\n\r\n\"Here you are, Helen!\" called Flossie's father, as he came back. \"Here's\r\nyour doll, all right, and she isn't hurt a bit. But the cookie is inside\r\nof Snap.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he like it?\" Helen wanted to know.\r\n\r\n\"He seemed to--very much,\" answered Mr. Bobbsey with a laugh. \"He made\r\nabout two bites of it, after he got it loose from the string by which\r\nyou had tied it to the doll.\"\r\n\r\nHelen dried her tears on the backs of her hands, and took the doll which\r\nhad been carried away by the dog. There were a few cookie crumbs\r\nsticking to her dress, and that was all that was left of the treat she\r\nhad been taking to a make-believe poor lady.\r\n\r\n\"Snap, what made you act so to Helen?\" asked Bert, shaking his finger at\r\nhis pet, when the dog came up from the end of the yard, wagging his\r\ntail. \"Don't you know you were bad?\"\r\n\r\nSnap did not seem to know anything of the kind. He kept on wagging his\r\ntail, and sniffed around Helen and her doll.\r\n\r\n\"He's smelling to see if I've any more cookies,\" said the little girl.\r\n\r\n\"I guess he is,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey. \"Well, come into the house, Helen,\r\nand I'll give you another cookie if you want it. But you had better not\r\ntie it to your doll, and go anywhere near Snap.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will eat it myself,\" said the little girl.\r\n\r\n\"One cookie a day is enough for Snap, anyhow,\" said Bert.\r\n\r\nThe dog himself did not seem to think so, for he followed the children\r\nand Mr. and Mrs. Bobbsey back to the house, as though hoping he would\r\nget another cake.\r\n\r\n\"Heah's a bone fo' yo',\" said Dinah to Snap, for she liked the big dog,\r\nand he liked her, I think, for he was in the kitchen as often as Dinah\r\nwould allow him. Or perhaps it was the good things that the fat cook\r\ngave him which Snap liked.\r\n\r\n\"When we heard you crying, out in the yard,\" said Mr. Bobbsey to Helen,\r\nas they were sitting in the dining-room, \"we didn't know what had\r\nhappened.\"\r\n\r\n\"We were afraid it was another dog fighting with Snap,\" went on Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Snap didn't fight me,\" Helen said. \"But he scared me just like I was\r\nscared when the gypsy man took Mollie, my talking doll.\"\r\n\r\nI have told you about this in the Blueberry Island book, you remember.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I must get back to the office,\" said Mr. Bobbsey, after a while.\r\n\"From there I'll write and tell Cousin Jasper that I'll come to see him,\r\nand hear his strange story.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we'll come too,\" added Bert with a laugh. \"Don't forget us, Daddy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll not,\" promised Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\nThe letter was sent to Mr. Dent, who was still in the hospital, and in a\r\nfew days a letter came back, asking Mr. Bobbsey to come as soon as he\r\ncould.\r\n\r\n\"Bring the children, too,\" wrote Cousin Jasper. \"They'll like it here,\r\nand if you will take a trip on the ocean with me they may like to come,\r\nalso.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does Cousin Jasper live on the ocean?\" asked Flossie, for she called\r\nMr. Dent \"cousin\" as she heard her father and mother do, though, really,\r\nhe was her second, or first cousin once removed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, he doesn't exactly live on the ocean,\" said Mr. Bobbsey. \"But he\r\nlives near it, and he often takes trips in boats, I think. He once told\r\nme he had a large motor boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's a motor boat?\" Freddie wanted to know.\r\n\r\n\"It is one that has a motor in it, like a motor in an automobile,\r\ninstead of a steam engine,\" said Mr. Bobbsey. \"Big boats and ships,\r\nexcept those that sail, are moved by steam engines. But a motor boat has\r\na gasolene motor, or engine, in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And are we going to ride in one?\" asked Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we'll see what Cousin Jasper wants us to do, and hear what his\r\nstrange news is,\" answered her father.\r\n\r\n\"Are we going from here to Florida in a motor boat?\" Freddie demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Well, not exactly, little fireman,\" his father replied with a laugh.\r\n\"We'll go from here to New York in a train, and from New York to Florida\r\nin a steamboat.\r\n\r\n\"After that we'll see what Cousin Jasper wants us to do. Maybe he will\r\nhave another boat ready to take us on a nice voyage.\"\r\n\r\n\"That'll be fun!\" cried Freddie. \"I hope we see a whale.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I hope it doesn't bump into us,\" said Flossie. \"Whales are awful\r\nbig, aren't they, Daddy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they are quite large. But I hardly think we shall see any between\r\nhere and Florida, though once in a while whales are sighted along the\r\ncoast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there any sharks?\" Bert asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, there are plenty of sharks, some large and some small,\" his\r\nfather answered. \"But they can't hurt us, and the ship will steam right\r\non past them in the ocean,\" he added, seeing that Flossie and Freddie\r\nlooked a bit frightened when Bert spoke of the sharks.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what Cousin Jasper really wants of you,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey to\r\nher husband, when the children had gone out to play.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" he answered, \"but we shall hear in a few days. We'll\r\nstart for Florida next week.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then the Bobbsey twins and their parents got ready for the trip.\r\nThey were to have many strange adventures before they saw their home\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nOFF FOR FLORIDA\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were many matters to be attended to at the Bobbsey home before the\r\nstart could be made for Florida. Mr. Bobbsey had to leave some one in\r\ncharge of his lumber business, and Mrs. Bobbsey had to plan for shutting\r\nup the house while the family were away. Sam and Dinah would go on a\r\nvacation while the others were in Florida, they said, and the pet\r\nanimals, Snap and Snoop, would be taken care of by kind neighbors.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing, Freddie?\" his mother asked him one day, when she\r\nheard him and Flossie hurrying about in the playroom, while Mrs. Bobbsey\r\nwas sorting over clothes to take on the trip.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we're getting out some things we want to take,\" the little boy\r\nanswered. \"Our playthings, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I take two of my dolls?\" Flossie asked.\r\n\r\n\"I think one will be enough,\" her mother said. \"We can't carry much\r\nbaggage, and if we go out on the deep blue sea in a motor boat we shall\r\nhave very little room for any toys. Take only one doll, Flossie, and let\r\nthat be a small one.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" Flossie answered.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bobbsey paid little attention to the small twins for a while as she\r\nand Nan were busy packing. Bert had gone down to the lumberyard office\r\non an errand for his father. Pretty soon there arose a cry in the\r\nplayroom.\r\n\r\n\"Mother, make Freddie stop!\" exclaimed Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing, Freddie?\" his mother called.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not doing anything,\" he answered, as he often did when Flossie and\r\nhe were having some little trouble.\r\n\r\n\"He is too doing something!\" Flossie went on. \"He splashed a whole lot\r\nof water on my doll.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's a rubber doll and water won't hurt,\" Freddie answered.\r\n\"Anyhow I didn't mean to.\"\r\n\r\n\"There! He's doing it again!\" cried Flossie. \"Make him stop, Mother!\"\r\n\r\n\"Freddie, what _are_ you doing?\" demanded Mrs. Bobbsey. \"Nan,\" she went\r\non in a lower voice, \"you go and peep in. Perhaps Flossie is just too\r\nfussy.\"\r\n\r\nBefore Nan could reach the playroom, which was down the hall from the\r\nroom where Mrs. Bobbsey was sorting over the clothes in a large closet,\r\nFlossie cried again:\r\n\r\n\"There! Now you got me all over wet!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear!\" exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey, laying aside a pile of garments. \"I\r\nsuppose I'll have to go and see what they are doing!\"\r\n\r\nBefore she could reach the playroom, however, Nan came back along the\r\nhall. She was laughing, but trying to keep quiet about it, so Flossie\r\nand Freddie would not hear her.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey. \"What are they doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Freddie is playing with his toy fire engine,\" Nan said. \"And he must\r\nhave squirted some water on Flossie, for she is wet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Much?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, only a little.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he mustn't do it,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey. \"I guess they are so\r\nexcited about going to Florida that they really don't know what they are\r\ndoing.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Bobbsey peered into the room where the two smaller twins had gone\r\nto play. Flossie was trying different dresses on a small rubber doll she\r\nhad picked out to take with her. On the other side of the room was\r\nFreddie with his toy fire engine. It was one that could be wound up, and\r\nit had a small pump and a little hose that spurted out real water when a\r\ntank on the engine was filled. Freddie was very fond of playing fireman.\r\n\r\n\"There, he's doing it again!\" cried Flossie, just as her mother came in.\r\n\"He's getting me all wet! Mother, make him stop!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Bobbsey was just in time to see Freddie start his toy fire engine,\r\nand a little spray of water did shower over his twin sister.\r\n\r\n\"Freddie, stop it!\" cried his mother. \"You know you mustn't do that!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't help it,\" Freddie said.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! You can't help it? Of course you can help squirting water on\r\nyour sister!\"\r\n\r\n\"He can so!\" pouted Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"No, Mother! I can't, honest,\" said Freddie. \"The hose of my fire engine\r\nleaks, and that makes the water squirt out on Flossie. I didn't mean to\r\ndo it. I'm playing there's a big fire and I have to put it out. And the\r\nhose busts--just like it does at real fires--and everybody gets all wet.\r\nI didn't do it on purpose!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I thought you did,\" said Flossie. \"Well, if it's just make believe\r\nI don't mind. You can splash me some more, Freddie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no he mustn't!\" said Mrs. Bobbsey, trying not to laugh, though she\r\nwanted to very much. \"It's all right to make believe you are putting out\r\na fire, Freddie boy, but, after all, the water is really wet and Flossie\r\nis damp enough now. If you want to play you must fix your leaky hose.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Mother, I will,\" promised the little boy.\r\n\r\nOne corner of the room was his own special place to play with the toy\r\nfire engine. A piece of oil cloth had been spread down so water would\r\nnot harm anything, and here Freddie had many good times.\r\n\r\nThere really was a hole in the little rubber hose of his engine, and the\r\nwater did come out where it was not supposed to. That was what made\r\nFlossie get wet, but it was not much.\r\n\r\n\"And, anyhow, it didn't hurt her rubber doll,\" said Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"No, she likes it,\" Flossie said. \"And I like it too, Freddie, if it's\r\nonly make believe fun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't do it any more,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey. \"You'll soon have water\r\nenough all around you, when you sail on the blue sea, and that ought to\r\nsatisfy you. Mend the hole in your fire engine hose, Freddie dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Mother,\" he answered. \"Anyhow, I guess I'll play something\r\nelse now. Toot! Toot! The fire's out!\" he called, and Mrs. Bobbsey was\r\nglad of it.\r\n\r\nFreddie put away his engine, which he and Flossie had to do with all\r\ntheir toys when they were done playing with them, and then ran out to\r\nfind Snap, the dog with which he wanted to have a race up and down the\r\nyard, throwing sticks for his pet to bring back to him.\r\n\r\nFlossie took her rubber doll and went over to Helen Porter's house,\r\nwhile Nan and Mrs. Bobbsey went back to the big closet to sort over the\r\nclothes, some of which would be taken on the Florida trip with them.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to take my fire engine with me,\" Freddie said, when he had\r\ncome in after having had fun with Snap.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean on the ship?\" asked Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I'm going to take my little engine on the ship with me. But first\r\nI'm going to have the hose mended.\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't need a fire engine on a ship,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I might,\" answered Freddie. \"Sometimes ships get on fire, and\r\nyou've got to put the fire out. I'll take it all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we'll hope our ship doesn't catch fire,\" remarked his mother.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Bobbsey came home to supper that evening, and heard what had\r\nhappened, he said there would be no room for Freddie's toy engine on the\r\nship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THEY WENT ON BOARD THE SHIP.]\r\n\r\n\"The trip we are going to take isn't like going to Meadow Brook, or to\r\nUncle William's seashore home,\" said the father of the Bobbsey twins.\r\n\"We can't take all the trunks and bags we would like to, for we shall\r\nhave to stay in two small cabins, or staterooms, on the ship. And\r\nperhaps we shall have even less room when we get on the boat with Cousin\r\nJasper--if we go on a boat. So we can't take fire engines and things\r\nlike that.\"\r\n\r\n\"But s'posin' the ship gets on fire?\" asked Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"We hope it won't,\" said Mr. Bobbsey. \"But, if it does, there are pumps\r\nand engines already on board. They won't need yours, Freddie boy, though\r\nit is very nice of you to think of taking it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't I take any toys?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you won't really need them,\" his father said. \"Once we get out\r\non the ocean there will be so much to see that you will have enough to\r\ndo without playing with the toys you use here at home. Leave everything\r\nhere, I say. If you want toys we can get them in Florida, and perhaps\r\nsuch different ones that you will like them even better than your old\r\nones.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could I take my little rubber doll?\" asked Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think you might do that,\" her father said, with a smile at the\r\nlittle girl. \"You can squeeze your rubber doll up smaller, if she takes\r\nup too much room.\"\r\n\r\nSo it was arranged that way. At first Freddie felt sad about leaving his\r\ntoy fire engine at home, but his father told him perhaps he might catch\r\na fish at sea, and then Freddie began saving all the string he could\r\nfind out of which to make a fish line.\r\n\r\nFinally the last trunk and valise had been packed. The railroad and\r\nsteamship tickets had been bought, Sam and Dinah got ready to go and\r\nstay with friends, Snap and Snoop were sent away--not without a rather\r\ntearful parting on the part of Flossie and Freddie--and then the Bobbsey\r\nfamily was ready to start for Florida.\r\n\r\nThey were to go to New York by train, and as nothing much happened\r\nduring that part of the journey I will skip over it. I might say,\r\nthough, that Freddie took from his pocket a ball of string, which he was\r\ngoing to use for his fishing, and the string fell into the aisle of the\r\ncar.\r\n\r\nThen the conductor came along and his feet got tangled in the cord,\r\ndragging the ball boundingly after him halfway down the coach.\r\n\r\n\"Hello! What's this?\" the conductor cried, in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's my fish line!\" answered Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you've caught something before you reached the sea,\" said the\r\nticket-taker as he untangled the string from his feet, and all the other\r\npassengers laughed.\r\n\r\nAfter a pleasant ride the Bobbsey twins reached New York, and, after\r\nspending a night in a hotel, and going to a moving picture show, they\r\nwent on board the ship the next morning. The ship was to take them down\r\nthe coast to Florida, where Cousin Jasper was ill in a hospital, though\r\nMr. Bobbsey had had a letter, just before leaving home, in which Mr.\r\nDent said he was feeling much better.\r\n\r\n\"All aboard! All aboard!\" called an officer on the ship, when the\r\nBobbseys had left their baggage in the stateroom where they were to stay\r\nduring the trip. \"All ashore that's going ashore!\"\r\n\r\n\"That means every one must get off who isn't going to Florida,\" said\r\nBert, who had been on a ship once before with his father.\r\n\r\nBells jingled, whistles blew, people hurried up and down the gangplank,\r\nor bridge from the dock to the boat, and at last the ship began to move.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Bobbsey were waving good-bye to friends on the pier, and\r\nNan and Bert were looking at the big buildings of New York, when Mrs.\r\nBobbsey turned, putting away the handkerchief she had been waving, and\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\"Where are Flossie and Freddie?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't they here?\" asked Mr. Bobbsey quickly.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered his wife. \"Oh, where are they?\"\r\n\r\nThe two little Bobbsey twins were not in sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nIN A PIPE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was so much going on with the sailing of the ship--so many\r\npassengers hurrying to and fro, calling and waving good-bye, so much\r\nnoise made by the jingling bells and the tooting whistles--that Mrs.\r\nBobbsey could hardly hear her own voice as she called:\r\n\r\n\"Flossie! Freddie! Where are you?\"\r\n\r\nBut the little twins did not answer, nor could they be seen on deck near\r\nMr. and Mrs. Bobbsey where they stood with Bert and Nan.\r\n\r\n\"They were here a minute ago,\" said Bert. \"I saw Flossie holding up her\r\nrubber doll to show her the Woolworth Building.\" This, as you know, is\r\nthe highest building in New York, if not in the world.\r\n\r\n\"But where is Flossie now?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey, and there was a worried\r\nlook on her face.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe she went downstairs,\" said Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"And where is Freddie?\" asked his mother.\r\n\r\n\"I saw him getting his ball of string ready to go fishing,\" laughed\r\nBert. \"I told him to put it away until we got out on the ocean. Then I\r\nsaw a fat man lose his hat and run after it and I didn't watch Freddie\r\nany more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't laugh, Bert! Where can those children be?\" cried Mrs.\r\nBobbsey. \"I told them not to go away, but to stay on deck near us, and\r\nnow they've disappeared!\"\r\n\r\n\"Did they go ashore?\" asked Nan. \"Oh, Mother! if they did we'll have to\r\nstop the ship and go back after them!\"\r\n\r\n\"They didn't go ashore,\" said Bert. \"They couldn't get there, because\r\nthe gangplank was pulled in while Freddie was standing here by me,\r\ngetting out his ball of string.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then they're all right,\" Mr. Bobbsey said. \"They are on board, and\r\nwe'll soon find them. I'll ask some of the officers or the crew. The\r\ntwins can't be lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but if they have fallen overboard!\" exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry,\" said her husband. \"We'd have heard of it before this if\r\nanything like that had happened. They're all right.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it proved. A little later Flossie and Freddie came walking along\r\nthe deck hand in hand. Flossie was carrying her rubber doll, and Freddie\r\nhad his ball of string, all ready to begin fishing as soon as the ship\r\nshould get out of New York Harbor.\r\n\r\n\"Where have you been?\" cried Mrs. Bobbsey. \"You children have given us\r\nsuch a fright! Where were you?\"\r\n\r\n\"We went to look at a poodle dog,\" explained Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"A lady had him in a basket,\" added Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean--a poodle dog in a basket?\" asked Bert.\r\n\r\nThen Freddie explained, while Mr. Bobbsey went to tell the steward, or\r\none of the officers of the ship, that the lost children had come safely\r\nback.\r\n\r\nThe smaller twins had seen one of the passengers with a pet dog in a\r\nblue silk-lined basket, and they had followed her around the deck to the\r\nother side of the ship, away from their parents, to get a better look at\r\nthe poodle. It was a pretty and friendly little animal, and the children\r\nhad been allowed to pat it. So they forgot what their mother had said to\r\nthem about not going away.\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't do it again,\" warned Mr. Bobbsey, and Flossie and Freddie\r\nsaid they would not.\r\n\r\nBy this time the big ship was well on her way down New York Bay toward\r\nthe Statue of Liberty, which the children looked at with wondering eyes.\r\nThey took their last view of the tall buildings which cluster in the\r\nlower end of the island of Manhattan, and then they felt that they were\r\nreally well started on their voyage.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I hope we have lots of fun in Florida!\" said Nan. \"I've always\r\nwanted to go there, _always_!\"\r\n\r\n\"So have I,\" Bert said. \"But maybe we won't stay in Florida long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" his sister asked.\r\n\r\n\"Because didn't father say Cousin Jasper wanted us to take a trip with\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"So he did,\" replied Nan. \"I wonder where he is going.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's part of the strange news he's going to tell,\" said Bert. \"Anyhow\r\nwe'll have a good time.\"\r\n\r\n\"And maybe we'll get shipwrecked!\" exclaimed Freddie, who, with his\r\nlittle sister Flossie, was listening to what the older Bobbsey twins\r\nwere saying.\r\n\r\n\"Shipwrecked!\" cried Bert. \"You wouldn't want that, would you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe. If we could live on an island like Robinson Crusoe,\" Freddie\r\nanswered, \"that would be lots of fun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but if we had to live on an island without anything to eat and no\r\nwater to drink, that wouldn't be so much fun,\" said Nan.\r\n\r\n\"If it was an island there'd be a lot of water all around it--that's\r\nwhat an island is,\" Flossie said. \"I learned it in geogogafy at school.\r\nAn island has water all around it, my geogogafy says.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but at sea the water is salty and you can't drink it,\" Bert said.\r\n\"I don't want to be shipwrecked.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, maybe I don't want to, either,\" said Freddie, after thinking\r\nabout it a little. \"Anyhow we'll have some fun!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" agreed Bert, \"I guess I will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now I'm going to fish,\" remarked Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"You won't catch anything,\" Bert said.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" Freddie wanted to know, as he again took the ball of string\r\nfrom his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"'Cause we're not out at sea yet,\" Bert replied. \"This is only the bay,\r\nand fish don't come up here on account of too many ships that scare 'em\r\naway. You'll have to wait until we get out where the water is colored\r\nblue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do fish like blue water?\" asked Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"I guess so,\" answered Bert. \"Anyhow, I don't s'pose you can catch any\r\nfish here, Freddie.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, the little Bobbsey twin boy had his own idea about that. He had\r\nbeen planning to catch some fish ever since he had heard about the trip\r\nto Florida. Freddie had been to the seashore several times, on visits to\r\nOcean Cliff, where Uncle William Minturn lived. But this was the first\r\ntime the small chap had been on a big ship. He knew that fish were\r\ncaught in the sea, for he had seen the men come in with boatloads of\r\nthem at Ocean Cliff. And he had caught fish himself at Blueberry Island.\r\nBut that, he remembered, was not in the sea.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Flossie,\" said Freddie, when Bert and Nan had walked away down\r\nthe deck. \"Come on, I'm going to do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do what, Freddie?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to catch some fish. I've got my string all untangled now.\"\r\n\r\n\"You haven't any fishhook,\" observed the little girl; \"and you can't\r\ncatch any fish lessen you have a hook.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can make one out of a pin, and I've got a pin,\" answered Freddie. \"I\r\ndassen't ever have a real hook, anyhow, all alone by myself, till I get\r\nbigger. But I can catch a fish on a pin-hook.\"\r\n\r\nHe did have a pin fastened to his coat, and this pin he now bent into\r\nthe shape of a hook and stuck it through a knot in the end of the long,\r\ndangling string.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going to fish?\" asked Flossie. She and her brother were\r\non the deck not far from the two staterooms of the Bobbsey family. Mrs.\r\nBobbsey was sitting in a steamer chair near the door of her room, where\r\nshe could watch the children.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to fish right here,\" Freddie said, pointing to the rail at\r\nthe side of the ship. \"I'm going to throw my line over here, with the\r\nhook on it, just like I fish off the bridge at home.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I'll watch you,\" said Flossie.\r\n\r\nOver the railing Freddie tossed his bent-pin hook and line. He thought\r\nit would reach down to the water, but he did not know how large the boat\r\nwas on which he was sailing to Florida.\r\n\r\nHis little ball of string unwound as the end of it dropped over the\r\nrail, but the hook did not reach the water. Even if it had, Freddie\r\ncould have caught nothing. In the first place a bent pin is not the\r\nright kind of hook, and, in the second place, Freddie had no bait on the\r\nhook. Bait is something that covers a hook and makes the fish want to\r\nbite on it. Then they are caught. But Freddie did not think of this just\r\nnow, and his hook had nothing on it. Neither did it reach down to the\r\nwater, and Freddie didn't know that.\r\n\r\nBut, as his string was dangling over the side of the ship there came a\r\nsudden tug on it, and the little boy pulled up as hard as he could.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I've caught a fish! I've caught a fish!\" he cried. \"Flossie, look,\r\nI've caught a fish!\"\r\n\r\nOf course Flossie could not see what was on the end of her brother's\r\nline, but it was something! She could easily tell that by the way\r\nFreddie was hauling in on the string.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what have you got?\" cried the little girl.\r\n\r\n\"I've got a big fish!\" said Freddie. \"I said I'd catch a fish, and I\r\ndid!\"\r\n\r\nFrom somewhere down below came shouts and cries.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" asked Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"Them's the people hollering 'cause I caught such a big fish,\" answered\r\nFreddie. \"Look, there it is!\"\r\n\r\nSomething large and black appeared above the edge of the rail.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Oh!\" cried Flossie.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bobbsey, from where she was sitting in her chair, heard the cries\r\nand came running over to the children.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing, Freddie?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Catching a fish!\" he answered. \"I got one and----\"\r\n\r\nThe black thing on the end of his line was pulled over the rail and\r\nflapped to the deck. Flossie and Freddie stared at it with wide-open\r\neyes. Then Flossie said:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what a funny fish!\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it was, for it wasn't a fish at all, but a woman's big black hat,\r\nwith feathers on it. Freddie's bent-pin hook had caught in the hat which\r\nwas being worn by a woman standing near the rail on the deck below where\r\nthe Bobbsey family had their rooms. And Freddie had pulled the hat right\r\noff the woman's head.\r\n\r\n\"No wonder the lady yelled!\" laughed Bert when he came to see what was\r\nhappening to his smaller brother and sister. \"You're a great fisherman,\r\nFreddie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, next time I'll catch a real fish,\" declared the little boy.\r\n\r\nBert carried the woman's hat down to her, and said Freddie was sorry for\r\nhaving caught it in mistake for a fish. The woman laughed heartily and\r\nsaid no harm had been done.\r\n\r\n\"But I couldn't imagine what was pulling my hat off my head,\" she told\r\nher friends. \"First I thought it was one of the seagulls.\"\r\n\r\nFreddie wound up his string, and said he would not fish any more until\r\nhe could see where his hook went to, and his father told him he had\r\nbetter wait until they got to St. Augustine, where he could fish from\r\nthe shore and see what he was catching.\r\n\r\nFrom the time they came on board until it was the hour to eat, the\r\nBobbsey twins looked about the ship, seeing something new and wonderful\r\non every side. They hardly wanted to go to bed when night came, but\r\ntheir mother said they must, as they would be about two days on the\r\nwater, and they would have plenty of time to see everything.\r\n\r\nBert, Freddie and their father had one stateroom and Mrs. Bobbsey and\r\nthe two girls slept in the other, \"next door,\" as you might say.\r\n\r\nThe night passed quietly, the ship steaming along over the ocean, and\r\ndown the coast to Florida. The next day the four children were up early\r\nto see everything there was to see.\r\n\r\nThey found the ship now well out to sea, and out of sight of land. They\r\nwere really on the deep ocean at last, and they liked it very much. Bert\r\nand Nan found some older children with whom to play, and Flossie and\r\nFreddie wandered off by themselves, promising not to go too far from\r\nMrs. Bobbsey, who was on deck in her easy chair, reading.\r\n\r\nAfter a while Flossie came running back to her mother in great\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mother! Oh, Mother!\" gasped the little girl. \"He's gone!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's gone?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey, dropping her book as she quickly stood\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\"Freddie's gone! We were playing hide-and-go-seek, and he went down a\r\nbig pipe, and now I can't see him! He's gone!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE SHARK\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Bobbsey hardly knew what to do for a moment. She just stood and\r\nlooked at Flossie as if she had not understood what the little girl had\r\nsaid. Then Freddie's mother spoke.\r\n\r\n\"You say he went down a big pipe?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mother,\" answered Flossie. \"We were playing hide-and-go-seek, and\r\nit was my turn to blind. I hollered 'ready or not I'm coming!' and when\r\nI opened my eyes to go to find Freddie, I saw him going down a big,\r\nround pipe.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of pipe?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey, thinking her little boy might\r\nhave crawled in some place on deck to hide, and that to Flossie it\r\nlooked like a pipe.\r\n\r\n\"It was a pipe sticking up like a smokestack,\" Flossie went on, \"and it\r\nwas painted red inside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you mean a ventilator pipe!\" cried Mrs. Bobbsey. \"If Freddie\r\ncrawled down in one of those he'll have a dreadful fall! Flossie, call\r\nyour father!\"\r\n\r\nFlossie did not exactly know what a ventilator pipe was, but I'll tell\r\nyou that it is a big iron thing, like a funnel, that lets fresh air from\r\nabove down into the boiler room where the firemen have to stay to make\r\nsteam to push the ship along. But, though Flossie did not quite know\r\nwhat a ventilator pipe was, she knew her mother was much frightened, or\r\nshe would not have wanted Mr. Bobbsey to come.\r\n\r\nFlossie saw her father about halfway down the deck, talking to some\r\nother men, and, running up to him, she cried:\r\n\r\n\"Freddie's down in a want-you-later pipe!\"\r\n\r\n\"A want-you-later pipe?\" repeated Mr. Bobbsey. \"What in the world do you\r\nmean, Flossie?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's what mother said,\" went on the little girl. \"Me and\r\nFreddie were playing hide-and-go-seek, and he hid down in a pipe painted\r\nred, and mother said it was a want-you-later. And she wants you now!\"\r\n\r\n\"A want-you-later pipe!\" exclaimed one of the men. \"Oh, she must mean a\r\nventilator. It does sound like that to a little girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's it,\" said Flossie. \"And please come quick to mother, will\r\nyou, Daddy?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bobbsey set off on a run toward his wife, and some of the other men\r\nfollowed, one of them taking hold of Flossie's hand.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Dick!\" cried Mrs. Bobbsey as her husband reached her, \"something\r\ndreadful has happened! Freddie is down a ventilator pipe, and I don't\r\nknow what to do!\"\r\n\r\nNeither did Mr. Bobbsey for a moment or two, and as the men came\r\ncrowding around him, one of them bringing up Flossie, a cry was heard,\r\ncoming from one of the red-painted pipes not far away. It was not a loud\r\ncry, sounding in fact, as if the person calling were down in a cellar.\r\n\r\n\"Come and get me out! Come and get me out!\" the voice begged, and when\r\nFlossie heard it she said:\r\n\r\n\"That's him! That's Freddie now. Oh, he's down in the pipe yet!\"\r\n\r\n\"Which pipe?\" asked Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\nFlossie pointed to a ventilator not far away. Mr. Bobbsey and the men\r\nran toward it, and, as they reached it, they could hear, coming out of\r\nthe big opening that was shaped somewhat like a funnel, a voice of a\r\nlittle boy, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Come and get me out! I'm stuck!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bobbsey put his head down inside the pipe and looked around. There\r\nhe saw Freddie, doubled up into a little ball, trying to get himself\r\nloose. Flossie's brother was, indeed, stuck in the pipe, which was\r\nsmaller below than it was at the opening--too small, in fact, to let the\r\nlittle boy slip through. So he was in no danger of falling.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Freddie! what made you get in there?\" asked his father, as he\r\nreached in, and, after pulling and tugging a bit, managed to get him\r\nout. \"What made you do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was hiding away from Flossie,\" answered the little fellow. \"I crawled\r\nin the pipe, and then I waited for her to come and find me. She didn't\r\nknow where I was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I did so know where you went,\" declared Flossie. \"I saw you crawl\r\ninto the pipe, and I didn't peek, either. I just opened my eyes and I\r\nsaw you go into the pipe, and I was scared and I ran and told mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you didn't peek it's all right,\" Freddie said. \"It was a good\r\nplace to hide. I waited and waited for you to come and find me and then\r\nI thought you were going to let me come on in home free, and I tried to\r\nget out. But I couldn't--I was stuck.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say you were!\" laughed Mr. Bobbsey. He could laugh now, and so\r\ncould Mrs. Bobbsey, though, at first, they were very much frightened,\r\nthinking Freddie might have been hurt.\r\n\r\n\"Don't crawl in there again, little fireman,\" said one of the men with\r\nwhom Mr. Bobbsey had been talking, and who knew the pet name of\r\nFlossie's brother. \"This pipe wasn't big enough to let you fall through,\r\nbut some of the ventilator pipes might be, and then you'd fall all the\r\nway through to the boiler room. Don't hide in any more pipes on the\r\nsteamer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't,\" Freddie promised, for he had been frightened when he found\r\nthat he was stuck in the pipe and couldn't get out. \"Come on, Flossie;\r\nit's your turn to hide now,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to play hide-and-go-seek any more,\" the little girl said.\r\n\"I'd rather play with my doll.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I had my fire engine I'd play fireman,\" Freddie said, for he did not\r\ncare much about a doll.\r\n\r\n\"How would you like to go down to the engine room with me, and see where\r\nyou might have fallen if the ventilator pipe hadn't been too small to\r\nlet you through?\" asked Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"I'd like it,\" Freddie said. \"I like engines.\"\r\n\r\nSo his father took him away down into the hold, or lower part of the\r\nboat, and showed him where the firemen put coal on the fire. There\r\nFreddie saw ventilator pipes, like the one he had hid in, reaching from\r\nthe boiler room up to the deck, so the firemen could breathe cool, fresh\r\nair. And there were also pipes like it in the engine room.\r\n\r\nFreddie watched the shining wheels go spinning round and he heard the\r\nhiss of steam as it turned the big propeller at the back of the ship,\r\nand pushed the vessel through the waters of the deep blue sea.\r\n\r\n\"Now we'll go up on deck,\" said Mr. Bobbsey, when Freddie had seen all\r\nhe cared to in the engine room. \"It's cooler there.\"\r\n\r\nFreddie and his father found several women talking to Mrs. Bobbsey, who\r\nwas telling them what had happened to her little boy, and Bert and Nan\r\nwere also listening.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what Freddie will do next?\" said Bert to his older sister.\r\n\"First he catches a lady's hat for a fish, and then he nearly gets lost\r\ndown a big pipe.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope he doesn't fall overboard,\" returned Nan.\r\n\r\n\"So do I,\" agreed Bert. \"And when we get on a smaller ship, if we go on\r\na voyage with Cousin Jasper, we'll have to look after Flossie and\r\nFreddie, or they will surely fall into the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we really, truly going on a voyage with Cousin Jasper, do you\r\nthink?\" Nan asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I heard father and mother talking about it, and they seemed to\r\nthink maybe we'd take a trip on the ocean,\" went on Bert.\r\n\r\n\"I hope we do!\" exclaimed Nan. \"I just love the water!\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I!\" her brother said. \"When I get big I'm going to have a ship of\r\nmy own.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you take me for a sail?\" asked Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Course I will!\" Bert quickly promised.\r\n\r\nThe excitement caused by Freddie's hiding in the ventilator pipe soon\r\npassed, and then the Bobbsey family and the other passengers on the ship\r\nenjoyed the fine sail. The weather was clear and the sea was not rough,\r\nso nearly every one was out on deck.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if we'll see any shipwrecks,\" remarked Bert a little later, as\r\nthe four Bobbsey twins were sitting in a shady place not far from Mrs.\r\nBobbsey, who was reading her book. She had told the children to keep\r\nwithin her sight.\r\n\r\n\"A shipwreck would be nice to see if nobody got drowned,\" observed Nan.\r\n\"And maybe we could rescue some of the people!\"\r\n\r\n\"When there's a shipwreck,\" said Freddie, who seemed to have been\r\nthinking about it, \"they have to get in the little boats, like this\r\none,\" and he pointed to a lifeboat not far away.\r\n\r\n\"That's an awful little boat to go on the big ocean in,\" said Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"It's safe, though,\" Bert said. \"It's got things in it to make it float,\r\neven if it's half full of water. It can't sink any more than our raft\r\ncould sink.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our raft nearly did sink,\" said Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"No, it only got stuck on a mud bank,\" answered Bert. \"I was the one\r\nthat sank down in my bare feet,\" and he laughed as he remembered that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"Well, anyhow, we had fun,\" said Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, look!\" suddenly cried Nan. \"There's a small boat now--out there on\r\nthe ocean. Maybe there's been a shipwreck, Bert!\"\r\n\r\nBert and the other Bobbsey twins looked at the object to which Nan\r\npointed. Not far from the steamer was a small boat with three or four\r\nmen in it, and they seemed to be in some sort of trouble. They were\r\nbeating the water with oars and poles, and something near the boat was\r\nlashing about, making the waves turn into foam.\r\n\r\n\"That isn't a shipwreck!\" cried Bert. \"That's a fisherman's boat!\"\r\n\r\n\"And something is after it!\" said Nan. \"Oh, Bert! maybe a whale is\r\ntrying to sink the fisherman's boat!\"\r\n\r\nBy this time Mrs. Bobbsey and a number of other passengers were crowding\r\nto the rail, looking at the small boat. The men in it did, indeed, seem\r\nto be fighting off something in the water that was trying to damage\r\ntheir boat.\r\n\r\n\"It's a big shark!\" cried one of the steamship sailors. \"The fishermen\r\nhave caught a big shark and they're trying to kill it before it sinks\r\ntheir boat. Say, it's a great, big shark! Look at it lash the water into\r\nfoam! Those men may be hurt!\"\r\n\r\n\"A shark! A shark!\" cried the passengers, and from all over the ship\r\nthey came running to where they could see what was happening to the\r\nsmall boat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE FIGHT IN THE BOAT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Bobbsey twins first saw the small boat, and the fishermen in it\r\ntrying to beat off the shark that was trying to get at them, the steamer\r\nwas quite a little distance off. The big vessel, though, was headed\r\ntoward the fishing boat and soon came close enough for the passengers to\r\nsee plainly what was going on. That is, they could not see the shark\r\nvery plainly, for it was mostly under water, but they could see a long,\r\nblack shape, with big fins and a large tail, and the tail was lashing up\r\nand down, making foam on the waves.\r\n\r\n\"Hi!\" cried Freddie in great excitement. \"That's better'n a shipwreck,\r\nisn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Almost as _bad_, I should say,\" remarked Mr. Bobbsey, who, with his\r\nwife and other passengers, stood near the rail with the children\r\nwatching the ocean fight.\r\n\r\n\"The captain ought to stop the ship and go to the rescue of those\r\nfishermen,\" said the man who had told Freddie not to get in the\r\nventilator pipe again. \"I guess the shark is bigger than those men\r\nthought when they tried to kill it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that what they are trying to do?\" asked Bert.\r\n\r\n\"It looks so,\" replied his father. \"Sometimes the fishermen catch a\r\nshark in their nets, and they kill it then, as sharks tear the nets, or\r\neat up the fish in them. But I guess this is a larger shark than usual.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is it going to sink the boat?\" Nan wanted to know.\r\n\r\n\"That I can't say,\" Mr. Bobbsey replied. \"Perhaps the fishermen caught\r\nthe shark on a big hook and line, and want to get it into the boat to\r\nbring it to shore. Or maybe the shark is tangled in their net and is\r\ntrying to get loose. Perhaps it thinks the boat is a big whale, or other\r\nfish, and it wants to fight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever it is, those fishermen are having a hard time,\" said another\r\npassenger; and this seemed to be so, for, just as soon as the steamer\r\ncame close enough to the small boat, some of the men in it waved their\r\nhands and shouted. All they said could not be heard, because of the\r\nnoise made by the steamer, but a man near Mrs. Bobbsey said he heard the\r\nfisherman cry:\r\n\r\n\"Come and help us!\"\r\n\r\n\"The captain ought to go to their help,\" said Flossie's mother. \"It must\r\nbe terrible to have to fight a big shark in a small boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess we are going to rescue them,\" observed Bert. \"Hark! There goes\r\nthe whistle! And that bell means stop the engines!\"\r\n\r\nThe blowing of a whistle and the ringing of a bell sounded even as he\r\nspoke, and the steamer began to move slowly.\r\n\r\nThen a mate, or one of the captain's helpers, came running along the\r\ndeck with some sailors. They began to lower one of the lifeboats, and\r\nthe Bobbsey twins and the other passengers watched them eagerly. Out on\r\nthe sea, which, luckily, was not rough, the men in the small boat were\r\nstill fighting the shark.\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to help them?\" asked Mr. Bobbsey of the mate who got into\r\nthe boat with the sailors.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I guess they are in trouble with a big shark, or maybe there are\r\ntwo of them. We'll help them kill the big fish.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the mate and the sailors were in the boat it was let down over the\r\nside of the ship to the water by long ropes. Then the sailors rowed\r\ntoward the fishermen.\r\n\r\nAnxiously the Bobbsey twins and the others watched to see what would\r\nhappen. Over the waves went the rescuing boat, and when it got near\r\nenough the men in it, with long, sharp poles, with axes and with guns,\r\nbegan to help fight the shark. The waters foamed and bubbled, and the\r\nmen in the boats shouted:\r\n\r\n\"There goes one!\" came a call after a while, and, for a moment,\r\nsomething long and black seemed to stick up into the air.\r\n\r\n\"It's a shark!\" cried Bert. \"I can tell by his pointed nose. Lots of\r\nsharks have long, pointed noses, and that's one!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I guess it is,\" his father said.\r\n\r\n\"Then there must be two sharks,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey, \"for the men are\r\nstill fighting something in the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they certainly are,\" her husband replied. \"The fishermen must have\r\ncaught one shark, and its mate came to help in the fight. Look, the\r\nfishing boat nearly went over that time!\"\r\n\r\nThat really came near happening. One of the big fish, after it found\r\nthat its mate had been killed, seemed to get desperate. It rushed at the\r\nfishermen's boat and struck it with its head, sending it far over on one\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThen the men from the steamer's boat fired some bullets from a gun into\r\nthe second shark and killed it so that it sank. The waters grew quiet\r\nand the boats were no longer in danger.\r\n\r\nThe mate and the sailors from the steamer stayed near the fishing boat a\r\nlittle while longer, the men talking among themselves, and then the\r\nsailors rowed back, and were hoisted upon deck in their craft.\r\n\r\n\"Tell us what happened!\" cried Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"It was sharks,\" answered the mate. \"The fishermen came out here to lift\r\ntheir lobster pots, which had drifted a long way from shore. While they\r\nwere doing this one of them baited a big hook with a piece of pork and\r\nthrew it overboard, for he had seen some sharks about. A shark bit on\r\nthe hook and then rammed the boat.\r\n\r\n\"Then another shark came along and both of them fought the fishermen,\r\nwho might have been drowned if we had not helped them kill the sharks.\r\nBut they are all right now--the fishermen, I mean--for the sharks are\r\ndead and on the bottom of the ocean by this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were they big sharks?\" asked Bert.\r\n\r\n\"Quite large,\" the mate answered. \"One was almost as long as the fishing\r\nboat, and they were both very ugly. It isn't often that such big sharks\r\ncome up this far north, but I suppose they were hungry and that made\r\nthem bold.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad I wasn't in that boat,\" said Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed we all may well be glad,\" Mrs. Bobbsey said.\r\n\r\n\"Will those fishermen have to row all the way to shore?\" asked Freddie,\r\nlooking across the waters. No land was in sight.\r\n\r\n\"No, they don't have to row,\" said the mate of the steamer. \"They have a\r\nlittle gasolene engine in their boat, and the land is not so far away as\r\nit seems, only five or six miles. They can get in all right if no more\r\nsharks come after them, and I don't believe any will.\"\r\n\r\nThe fishermen waved their hands to the passengers on the steamer, and\r\nthe Bobbsey twins and the others waved back.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye!\" shouted the children, as loudly as they could. Whether the\r\nothers heard them or not was not certain, but they continued to wave\r\ntheir hands.\r\n\r\nIt took some time to hoist the lifeboat up in its place on the steamer,\r\nand in this Freddie and the others were quite interested.\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to own a boat like that myself,\" said the little boy.\r\n\r\n\"What would you do with it?\" questioned Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'd have a whole lot of fun,\" was the ready answer.\r\n\r\n\"Would you give me a ride?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I would!\"\r\n\r\nAt last the lifeboat was put in its proper place, and then the steamer\r\nstarted off again.\r\n\r\nThe Bobbsey twins had plenty to talk about now, and so did the other\r\npassengers. It was not often they witnessed a rescue of that kind at\r\nsea, and Bert, who, like Freddie, had been hoping he might sight a\r\nshipwreck--that is, he wished it if no one would be drowned--was quite\r\nsatisfied with the excitement of the sharks.\r\n\r\n\"Only I wish they could have brought one over closer, so we could have\r\nseen how big it was,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I don't,\" remarked Nan. \"I don't like sharks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not even when they're dead and can't hurt you?\" asked Bert.\r\n\r\n\"Not even any time,\" Nan said. \"I don't like sharks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither do I,\" said Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'd like to see one if daddy would take hold of my hand,\" put in\r\nFreddie. \"Then I wouldn't be afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe there'll be sharks when we get to Cousin Jasper's house,\" said\r\nFlossie.\r\n\r\n\"His house isn't in the ocean, and sharks is only in the ocean,\"\r\ndeclared Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"Well, maybe his house is _near_ the ocean,\" went on the little \"fat\r\nfairy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cousin Jasper is in the hospital,\" Nan remarked; \"and I guess they\r\ndon't have any sharks there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe they have alligators,\" added Bert with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Really?\" asked Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know Florida is where they have lots of alligators,\" went on\r\nher older brother. \"And we're going to Florida.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't like alligators any more than I like sharks,\" Nan said, with a\r\nlittle shivery sort of shake. \"I just like dogs and cats and chickens.\"\r\n\r\n\"And goats,\" said Flossie. \"You like goats, don't you, Nan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I like the kind of a goat we had when we went to Blueberry\r\nIsland,\" agreed Nan. \"But look! What are the sailors doing?\"\r\n\r\nShe pointed to some of the men from the ship, who were going about the\r\ndecks, picking up chairs and lashing fast, with ropes, things that might\r\nroll or slide about.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe we're almost there, and we're getting ready to land,\" said\r\nFreddie.\r\n\r\n\"No, we've got another night to stay on the ship,\" Bert said. \"I'm going\r\nto ask one of the men.\" And he did, inquiring what the reason was for\r\npicking up the chairs and tying fast so many things.\r\n\r\n\"The captain thinks we're going to run into a storm,\" answered the\r\nsailor, \"and we're getting ready for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will it be very bad?\" asked Nan, who did not like storms.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's likely to be a hard one, little Miss,\" the sailor said. \"We\r\nwill soon be off Cape Hatteras, and the storms there are fierce\r\nsometimes. So we're making everything snug to get ready for the blow.\r\nBut don't be afraid. This is a strong ship.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, as the Bobbsey twins saw the sailors making fast everything,\r\nand lashing loose awnings and ropes, and as they saw the sky beginning\r\nto get dark, though it was not yet night, they were all a little\r\nfrightened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nIN ST. AUGUSTINE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe storm came up more quickly than even the captain or his sailors\r\nthought it would. The deep, blue sea, which had been such a pretty color\r\nwhen the sun shone on it, now turned to a dark green shade. The blue sky\r\nwas covered by black and angry-looking clouds, and the wind seemed to\r\nmoan as it hummed about the ship.\r\n\r\nBut the steamer did not stop. On it rushed over the water, with foam in\r\nfront, at the prow, or bow, and foam at the stern where the big\r\npropeller churned away.\r\n\r\n\"Come, children!\" called Mrs. Bobbsey to the twins, as they stood at the\r\nrail, looking first up at the gathering clouds and then down at the\r\nwater, which was now quite rough. \"Come! I think we had better go to our\r\ncabins.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, let us stay up just a little longer,\" begged Bert. \"I've never seen\r\na storm at sea, and I want to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you and Nan may stay up on deck a little longer,\" said Mrs.\r\nBobbsey. \"But you must not go far away from daddy. I don't want any of\r\nyou to fall overboard, especially when such big sharks may be in the\r\nocean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm not going to fall overboard!\" exclaimed Bert. \"Never!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I,\" added his sister. \"I'll keep tight hold of the rail, and when\r\nit gets too rough we'll come down.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bobbsey and some of the men passengers were still on deck, watching\r\nthe approach of the storm, and Bert and Nan moved over nearer their\r\nfather, while Mrs. Bobbsey went below with Flossie and Freddie. The two\r\nsmaller twins, when they found their older brother and sister were going\r\nto stay on deck, also wanted to do this, but their mother said to them:\r\n\r\n\"No, it is safer for you to be down below with me. It may come on to\r\nblow hard at any moment, and then it won't be so easy to go down the\r\nstairs when the ship is standing on its head, or its ear, or whatever\r\nway ships stand in a storm.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I want to see the storm!\" complained Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"You'll see all you want of it, and feel it, too, down in our stateroom,\r\nas well as up on deck, and you'll be much safer,\" his mother told him.\r\n\r\nThe storm came up more and more quickly, and, though it was not yet four\r\no'clock, it was as dark as it usually is at seven, for so many clouds\r\ncovered the sky. The waves, too, began to get larger and larger and,\r\npretty soon, the steamer, which had been going along smoothly, or with\r\nnot more than a gentle roll from side to side, began pitching and\r\ntossing.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my! isn't it getting dark?\" cried Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"Say, it isn't time to go to bed yet, is it?\" questioned Freddie\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Of course not!\" answered his twin. \"It's only about the middle of the\r\nafternoon, isn't it, Mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just about,\" answered Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the others, who were still on deck, were having a\r\ndecidedly lively time of it.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Nan and Bert!\" called Mr. Bobbsey, to the older twins. \"Better\r\nget below while you have the chance. It's getting too rough for children\r\nup here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you coming too, Daddy?\" asked Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'll go down with you. In fact, I think every one is going below\r\nexcept the sailors.\"\r\n\r\nThis was so, for the mate was going about telling the passengers still\r\non deck that it would be best for them to get to the shelter of the\r\ncabins and staterooms.\r\n\r\nNan and Bert started to walk across the deck, and when they were almost\r\nat the stairs, or the \"companionway\" as it is called, that led to their\r\nrooms, the ship gave a lurch and roll, and Bert lost his balance.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Oh!\" he cried, as he found himself sliding across the deck, which\r\nwas tilted up almost like an old-fashioned cellar door, and Bert was\r\nrolling down it. \"Oh, catch me, Dad!\"\r\n\r\nLuckily he rolled in, and not out, or he would have rolled to the edge\r\nof the ship. Not that he could have gone overboard, for there was a\r\nrailing and netting to stop that, but he would have been badly\r\nfrightened if he had rolled near the edge, I think.\r\n\r\n\"Look out!\" cried Mr. Bobbsey, as he saw Bert sliding and slipping.\r\n\"Look out, or you'll fall downstairs!\"\r\n\r\nAnd that is just what happened. Bert rolled to the top of the\r\ncompanionway stairs, and right down them. Luckily he was a stout, chubby\r\nboy, and, as it happened, just then a sailor was coming up the stairs,\r\nand Bert rolled into him. The sailor was nearly knocked off his feet by\r\nthe collision with Bert, but he managed to get hold of a rail and hold\r\non.\r\n\r\n\"My! My! What's this?\" cried the sailor, when he got his breath, which\r\nBert had partly knocked from him. \"Is this a new way to come\r\ndownstairs?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I didn't mean to,\" Bert answered, as he managed to stand up and hold\r\non to the man. \"The ship turned upside down, I guess, and I rolled down\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, as long as you're not hurt it's all right,\" said the sailor with\r\na laugh. \"It is certainly a rough storm. Better get below and stay there\r\nuntil it blows out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, I'm getting,\" grinned Bert.\r\n\r\n\"I think that is good advice,\" said Mr. Bobbsey to the sailor, with a\r\nsmile, as he hurried after Bert, but not coming in the same fashion as\r\nhis son.\r\n\r\nNan had grabbed tightly hold of a rope and clung to it when the ship\r\ngave a lurch. She was not hurt, but her arms ached from holding on so\r\ntightly.\r\n\r\nAfter that one big roll and toss the steamer became steady for a little\r\nwhile, and Mr. Bobbsey and the two children made their way to the\r\nstateroom where Mrs. Bobbsey was sitting with Flossie and Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"What happened?\" asked Bert's mother, as she saw that he was rather\r\n\"mussed up,\" from what had occurred.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I tried to come down the stairs head first,\" Bert answered with a\r\nlaugh. \"I don't like that way. I'm not going to do it again,\" and he\r\ntold what had taken place.\r\n\r\nAnd then the storm burst with a shower of rain and a heavy wind that\r\ntossed and pitched the boat, and made many of the passengers wish they\r\nwere safe on shore.\r\n\r\nThe Bobbsey twins had often been on the water, when on visits to Uncle\r\nWilliam at the seashore, as I have told you in that book, and they were\r\nnot made ill by the pitching and tossing of the steamer.\r\n\r\nStill it was not much fun to stay below decks, which they and the others\r\nhad to do all that night and most of the next day. It was too rough for\r\nany one to be out on deck, and even the sailors, used as they were to\r\nit, had trouble. One of them was nearly washed overboard, but his mates\r\nsaved him. And one of the lifeboats--the same one in which the men had\r\ngone to save the fishermen from the sharks--was broken and torn away\r\nwhen a big wave hit it.\r\n\r\n\"Is it always rough like this when you go past Cape Hatteras?\" asked\r\nBert of his father.\r\n\r\n\"Very frequently, yes. You see Cape Hatteras is a point of land of North\r\nCarolina, sticking out into the ocean. In the ocean are currents of\r\nwater, and when one rushes one way and one the other, and they come\r\ntogether, it makes a rough sea, especially when there is a strong wind,\r\nas there is now. We are in this rough part of the ocean, and in the\r\nmidst of a storm, too. But we will soon be out of it.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, the steamer could not go so fast in the rough water as she\r\ncould have traveled had it been smooth, and the wind, blowing against\r\nher, also held her back. So it was not until late on the second day that\r\nthe storm passed away, or rather, until the ship got beyond it.\r\n\r\nThen the rain stopped, the sun came out from behind the clouds just\r\nbefore it was time to set, and the hard time was over. The sea was\r\nrough, and would be for another day, the sailors said.\r\n\r\n\"And can we go on deck in the morning?\" asked Bert, who did not like\r\nbeing shut up in the stateroom.\r\n\r\n\"I guess so,\" his father answered.\r\n\r\nThe next morning all was calm and peaceful, though the waves were larger\r\nthan when the Bobbsey twins had left New York.\r\n\r\nEvery one was glad that the storm had passed, and that nothing had\r\nhappened to the steamer, except the loss of the one small boat.\r\n\r\n\"Were those fishermen who fought the sharks out in all that blow in\r\ntheir small motor boat, Dad?\" asked Bert.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" his father told him. \"They only go out from shore, take up\r\ntheir nets or lobster pots, and go quickly back again. Their boats are\r\nnot made for staying out in all night. Though perhaps sometimes, in a\r\nfog, when they can't see to get back, they may be out a long time. But I\r\ndon't believe they were out in this storm.\"\r\n\r\nIt was peaceful traveling now, on the deep blue sea, which was a pretty\r\ncolor again, and the Bobbsey twins, leaning over the rail and looking at\r\nit, thought they had never come on such a fine voyage.\r\n\r\n\"It's getting warmer,\" said Bert when they had eaten dinner and were\r\nonce more on deck.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we are getting farther south, nearer to the equator, and it is\r\nalways warm there,\" said Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"Are we near Florida?\" asked Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we will be there this evening,\" her father told her.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon when the steamer reached Jacksonville. As\r\nthe arrival of the steamship had been delayed by the storm, the\r\nBobbsey's were left no time to look about Jacksonville, but hurried at\r\nonce to the railroad station, and there took the train that carried them\r\nto St. Augustine. It was about an hour before sunset when they got out\r\nof the train at this quaint, pretty old town.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what funny little streets!\" cried Bert, as they started for their\r\nhotel where they were to stay until they could go to the hospital and\r\nsee Cousin Jasper. \"What little streets!\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't they darling?\" exclaimed Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, this is a very old city,\" said Mr. Bobbsey, \"and some of the\r\nstreets are no wider than they were made when they were laid out here\r\nover three hundred years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, is this city as old as that--three hundred years?\" asked Nan, while\r\nFlossie and Freddie peered about at the strange sights.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and older,\" said Mr. Bobbsey. \"St. Augustine is the oldest city in\r\nthe United States. It was settled in 1565 by the Spaniards, and I\r\nsuppose they built it like some of the Spanish cities they knew. That is\r\nwhy the streets are so narrow.\"\r\n\r\nAnd indeed the streets were very narrow. The one called St. George is\r\nonly seventeen feet wide, and it is the principal street in St.\r\nAugustine. Just think of a street not much wider than a very big room.\r\nAnd Treasury street is even narrower, being so small that two people can\r\nstand and shake hands across it. Really, one might call it only an\r\nalley, and not a street.\r\n\r\nThe Bobbseys saw many negroes about the streets, some driving little\r\ndonkey carts, and others carrying fruit and other things in baskets on\r\ntheir heads.\r\n\r\n\"Don't they ever fall off?\" asked Freddie, as he watched one big, fat\r\ncolored woman on whose head, covered with a bright, red handkerchief, or\r\n\"bandanna,\" there was a large basket of fruit. \"Don't they ever fall\r\noff?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean fall off--their heads?\" asked Bert with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"No, I mean the things they carry,\" said Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess they start in carrying things that way from the time they\r\nare children,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey, \"and they learn to balance things on\r\ntheir heads as well as you children learn to balance yourselves on\r\nroller skates. I dare say the colored people here would find it as hard\r\nto roller skate as you would to carry a heavy load on your head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, here we are at our hotel,\" said Mr. Bobbsey, as the automobile in\r\nwhich they had ridden up from the station came to a stop in front of a\r\nfine building. \"Now we will get out and see what they have for supper.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then will we go to Cousin Jasper and find out what his strange\r\nstory is?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess so,\" her father answered.\r\n\r\n\"Say, this is a fine hotel!\" exclaimed Bert as he and the others saw the\r\nbeautiful palm and flower gardens, with fountains between them, in the\r\ncourtyard of the place where they were to stop.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, St. Augustine has wonderful hotels,\" said his father. \"This is\r\na place where many rich people come to spend the winter that would be\r\ntoo cold for them in New York. Now come inside.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SHIP GAVE A LURCH AND BURT LOST HIS BALANCE.]\r\n\r\nInto the beautiful hotel they went, and when Mr. Bobbsey was asking\r\nabout their rooms, and seeing that the baggage was brought in, Mrs.\r\nBobbsey glanced around to make sure the four twins were with her, for\r\nsometimes Flossie or Freddie strayed off.\r\n\r\nAnd that is what had happened this time. Freddie was not in sight.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, where is that boy?\" cried his mother. \"I hope he hasn't crawled\r\ndown another ventilator pipe!\"\r\n\r\n\"No'm,\" answered one of the hotel men. \"He hasn't done that. I saw your\r\nlittle boy run back out of the front door a moment ago. But he'll be all\r\nright. Nothing can happen to him in St. Augustine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but I must find him!\" exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey. \"Dick, Freddie is\r\ngone again!\" she said to her husband. \"We must find him at once!\" and\r\nshe hurried from the hotel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nCOUSIN JASPER'S STORY\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Bobbsey, who had been talking to the clerk of the hotel at the desk,\r\nlooked toward Mrs. Bobbsey, who was hurrying out the front door.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute!\" he called after her. \"I'll come with you!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you stay with the other children,\" she answered. \"I'll find\r\nFreddie.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you don't know your way about St. Augustine,\" said Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\"You've never been here before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither have you,\" returned his wife with a laugh, for she was not very\r\nmuch alarmed about Freddie--he had slipped away too often before.\r\n\r\n\"I can find my way about as well as you can, Dick,\" went on Mrs.\r\nBobbsey. \"You stay here and I'll get our little fat fireman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe he has gone to see a fire engine,\" suggested Nan.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe so,\" answered her father. \"I didn't hear any alarm, but\r\nperhaps they don't sound one here as we do back in Lakeport.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess he's just gone out to look at the things in the streets here,\"\r\nsaid Bert. \"They're a lot different from at home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed they are!\" exclaimed Mr. Bobbsey. \"Well, I'll stay here,\" he\r\nsaid to his wife, \"and you go and look for Freddie. But if you don't\r\nsoon find him come back and I'll go out.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll find him,\" she said, and one of the porters from the hotel offered\r\nto go with her to show Mrs. Bobbsey her way about the strange streets of\r\nSt. Augustine--the little, narrow streets that had not been changed much\r\nin three hundred years.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what a lovely place this is,\" said Nan to Bert, while their father\r\nwas talking with the hotel clerk. \"It's like a palace.\"\r\n\r\n\"It looks like some of the places you see in a moving picture,\" said\r\nBert.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed the beautiful hotel, with the palms and flowers set all\r\nabout, did look like some moving picture play. Only it was real, and the\r\nBobbsey twins were to stay there until they had seen Cousin Jasper, and\r\nfound out what his strange story was about.\r\n\r\nSoon after Mr. Bobbsey had finished signing his name and those of the\r\nmembers of his family in the hotel register book, Mrs. Bobbsey came\r\nback, leading Freddie by the hand.\r\n\r\nThe little boy seemed to be all right, and he was smiling, while in one\r\nhand he held a ripe banana.\r\n\r\n\"Where've you been, Freddie?\" asked Flossie. \"I was afraid you had gone\r\nback home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nope,\" Freddie answered, as he started to peel the banana. \"I was\r\nseeing how they did it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How who did what?\" asked his father.\r\n\r\n\"Carried the big baskets on their heads,\" Freddie answered, and by this\r\ntime he had part of the skin off the yellow fruit, and was breaking off\r\na piece for Flossie. Freddie always shared his good things with his\r\nlittle sister, and with Bert and Nan if there was enough.\r\n\r\n\"What does he mean?\" asked Bert of his mother. \"Was he trying to carry\r\nsomething on his head?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Mrs. Bobbsey with a laugh, \"but he was following a big\r\ncolored woman who had a basket of fruit on her head. I caught him\r\nhalfway down the street in front of another hotel. He was walking after\r\nthis woman, and he didn't hear me coming. I asked him what he was doing,\r\nand he said he was waiting to see it fall off.\"\r\n\r\n\"What fall off?\" asked Nan, coming up just then.\r\n\r\n\"I thought maybe the basket would fall off her head,\" Freddie answered\r\nfor himself. \"It was an awful big basket, and it wibbled and wobbled\r\nlike anything. I thought maybe it would fall, but it didn't,\" he added\r\nwith a sigh, as though he had been cheated out of a lot of fun.\r\n\r\n\"If it did had fallen,\" he went on, \"I was going to pick up her bananas\r\nand oranges for her. That's why I kept walking after her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she drop that banana?\" asked Mr. Bobbsey, while several smiling\r\npersons gathered about the Bobbsey twins in the hotel lobby.\r\n\r\n\"No, I bought this with a penny,\" Freddie answered. \"The colored lady\r\ndidn't drop any. But if her basket did had fallen from off her head I\r\ncould have picked up the things, and then maybe she'd have given me a\r\nbanana or an orange.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when that didn't happen you had to go buy one yourself; did you?\"\r\nasked Mr. Bobbsey with a laugh. \"Well, that's too bad. But, after this,\r\nFreddie, don't go away by yourself. It's all right, at home, to run off\r\nand play in the fields or woods, for you know your way about. But here\r\nyou are in a strange city, so you must stay with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered Freddie, like a good little boy.\r\n\r\n\"I will, too,\" promised Flossie.\r\n\r\nThe Bobbsey family was together once again, and when Flossie and Freddie\r\nhad eaten the banana, and porters had taken charge of their baggage,\r\nthey all went up to the rooms where they were to stay.\r\n\r\n\"We don't know just how long we'll be here,\" said Mr. Bobbsey, as they\r\nwere getting ready to go down to supper, as the children called it, or\r\n\"dinner,\" as the more fashionable name has it.\r\n\r\n\"Are we going out on the ocean again?\" asked Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Did you like it?\" her father wanted to know.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, lots!\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"It was great!\" declared Bert.\r\n\r\n\"I want to see 'em catch some more sharks,\" Freddie said.\r\n\r\n\"I like to see the blue water,\" added Flossie, who had got out a clean\r\ndress for her rubber doll.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the blue water is very pretty,\" remarked Mr. Bobbsey. \"Well, we\r\nshall, very likely, sail on it again. I don't know just what Cousin\r\nJasper wants to tell me, or what he wants me to do. But I think he is\r\nplanning an ocean trip himself. I'll go to see him this evening, after\r\nwe have eaten, and then I can tell you all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I come with you?\" asked Bert.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I think not this first trip,\" answered Mr. Bobbsey slowly. \"I am\r\ngoing to the hospital where Cousin Jasper is ill, and he may not be able\r\nto see both of us. I'll take you later.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can stay and watch the colored people carry things on their heads,\"\r\nput in Freddie. \"That's lots of fun, and maybe some of 'em will drop\r\noff, and we can help pick 'em up, and they might give us an orange.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess I'd rather buy my oranges, and then I'll be sure to have what I\r\nwant,\" said Bert with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"There are plenty of things you can look at while I'm at the hospital,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Bobbsey, and after the meal he inquired the way to the place\r\nwhere Cousin Jasper was getting well, while Mrs. Bobbsey took the\r\nchildren down to the docks, where they could see many motor boats, and\r\nfishing and oyster craft, tied up for the night.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful evening, and the soft, balmy air of St. Augustine was\r\nwarm, so that only the lightest clothing needed to be worn.\r\n\r\n\"It's just like being at the seashore in the summer,\" said Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Well, this is summer, and we are at the seashore, though it is not like\r\nOcean Cliff,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey with a smile. She was glad the children\r\nliked it, and she hoped they would have more good times if they were\r\nagain to go sailing on the deep, blue sea.\r\n\r\nWhen they got back to the hotel Mr. Bobbsey had not yet returned from\r\nthe hospital, but he came before Flossie and Freddie were ready for bed,\r\nfor they had been allowed to stay up a little later than usual.\r\n\r\n\"Well, how is Cousin Jasper?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"Much better, I am glad to say,\" answered her husband. \"He will be able\r\nto leave the hospital in a few days, and then he wants us to start on a\r\ntrip with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Start on a trip so soon!\" exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey. \"Where does he want\r\nto go, and will he be well enough to travel?\"\r\n\r\n\"He says he will. And as to where he wants to go, that is a strange\r\nstory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, tell us about it!\" begged Bert.\r\n\r\n\"We're going to hear Cousin Jasper's secret at last!\" cried Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Is it a real story, with 'once upon a time' in it?\" Freddie questioned.\r\n\"And has it got a fire engine in it?\" he added.\r\n\r\n\"Well, no, not exactly a fire engine, though it has a boat engine in the\r\nstory. And I can make it start with 'once upon a time,' if you want me\r\nto.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please do,\" begged Flossie. \"And has it got any fairies in it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not exactly any fairies,\" her father said; \"though we may find some\r\nwhen we get to the island.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, are we going on an island?\" exclaimed Bert.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" cried his father, \"I've started at the wrong end. I had better\r\nbegin at the beginning. And that will be to tell you how I found Cousin\r\nJasper.\r\n\r\n\"He has been quite ill, and is better now. Part of the time he was out\r\nof his head with fever, even after he wrote to me, and for a time the\r\ndoctor feared he would not get well. But now he is all right, except for\r\nbeing weak, and he told me a queer story.\r\n\r\n\"Once upon a time,\" went on Mr. Bobbsey, telling the tale as his littler\r\nchildren liked to hear it, \"Cousin Jasper and a young friend of his, a\r\nboy about fifteen years old, set out to take a long trip in a motor\r\nboat. That is it had an engine in it that ran by gasolene as does an\r\nautomobile. Cousin Jasper is very fond of sailing the deep, blue sea,\r\nand he took this boy along with him to help. They were to sail about for\r\na week, visiting the different islands off the coast of Florida.\r\n\r\n\"Well, everything went all right the first few days. In their big motor\r\nboat Cousin Jasper and this boy, who was named Jack Nelson, sailed\r\nabout, living on their boat, cooking their meals, and now and then\r\nlanding at the little islands, or keys, as they are called.\r\n\r\n\"They were having a good time when one day a big storm came up. They\r\ncould not manage their boat and they were blown a long way out to sea\r\nand then cast up on the shore of a small island.\r\n\r\n\"Cousin Jasper was hurt and so was the boy, but they managed to get out\r\nof the water and up on land. They found a sort of cave in which they\r\ncould get out of the storm, and they stayed on the island for some\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"For years?\" asked Bert, who, with the other Bobbsey twins, was much\r\ninterested in Cousin Jasper's strange story. \"That was just like\r\nRobinson Crusoe!\" Bert went on. \"Why didn't they stay there always?\"\r\n\r\n\"They did not have enough to eat,\" said Mr. Bobbsey, \"and it was too\r\nlonesome for them there. They were the only people on the island, as far\r\nas they knew. So they made a smudge of smoke, and on a pole they put up\r\nsome pieces of canvas that had washed ashore from their motor boat. They\r\nhoped these signals would be seen by some ship or small boat that might\r\ncome to take them off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did they get rescued?\" asked Bert.\r\n\r\nMr. Bobbsey was about to answer when the telephone, which was in the\r\nroom, gave a loud ring.\r\n\r\n\"Some one for us!\" exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE MOTOR BOAT\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Bobbsey arose to answer the telephone, which big hotels put in the\r\nrooms of their guests nowadays instead of sending a bellboy to knock and\r\nsay that the traveler is wanted.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder who wants us?\" murmured Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\nThe children looked disappointed that the telling of the story had to be\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" said their father into the telephone.\r\n\r\nThen he listened, and seemed quite surprised at what he heard.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'll be down in a little while,\" he went on. \"Tell him to wait.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey. \"Was that Cousin Jasper?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no indeed!\" her husband answered. \"Though he is much better he is\r\nnot quite well enough to leave the hospital yet and come to see us. This\r\nwas an old sea captain talking from the main office of the hotel\r\ndownstairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he going to take us for a trip on the ocean?\" asked Bert eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's what he wants to do, or, rather, he wants me to see about\r\na big motor boat in which to take a trip. Cousin Jasper sent him to me.\r\nBut let me finish what I was saying about the island, and then I'll tell\r\nyou about the sea captain.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bobbsey hung up the telephone receiver and took his seat between\r\nFlossie and Freddie where he had been resting in an easy chair, telling\r\nthe story.\r\n\r\n\"Cousin Jasper,\" went on Mr. Bobbsey, \"was quite ill on the island, and\r\nso was Jack Nelson. Just how long they stayed there, waiting for a boat\r\nto come and take them off, they do not know--at least, Cousin Jasper\r\ndoes not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't that boy--Jack Nelson--know?\" asked Bert.\r\n\r\n\"No, for he wasn't taken off the island,\" said Mr. Bobbsey. \"And that is\r\nthe strange part of Cousin Jasper's story. He, himself, after a hard\r\ntime on the island, must have fallen asleep, in a fever probably. When\r\nhe awakened he was on board a small steamer, being brought back to St.\r\nAugustine. He hardly knew what happened to him, until he found himself\r\nin the hospital.\r\n\r\n\"There he slowly got better until he was well enough to write and ask me\r\nto come to see him. He wanted me to do something that no one else would\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is that?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"He wants me to get a big motor boat, and go with him to this island and\r\nget that boy, Jack Nelson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that boy still on the island?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey. \"Why how long ago\r\nwas this?\"\r\n\r\n\"About three weeks,\" her husband answered. \"Cousin Jasper does not know\r\nwhether or not the boy is still there, but he is afraid he is. You see\r\nwhen the boat came to rescue Mr. Dent, as my cousin is called at the\r\nhospital, they did not take off with him his boy friend. The sailors of\r\nthe rescue ship said they saw Cousin Jasper's canvas flag fluttering\r\nfrom a pole stuck up in the beach, and that brought them to the island.\r\nThey found Cousin Jasper, unconscious, in a little cave-like shelter\r\nnear shore, and took him away with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't they see the boy?\" asked Nan.\r\n\r\n\"No, he was not in sight, the sailors afterward told Mr. Dent. They did\r\nnot look for any one else, not knowing that two had been shipwrecked on\r\nthe island. They thought there was only one, and so Cousin Jasper alone\r\nwas saved.\r\n\r\n\"When he grew better, and the fever left him, he tried to get some one\r\nto start out in a boat to go to the island and save that boy. But no one\r\nwould go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"Because they thought Cousin Jasper was still out of his mind from\r\nfever. They said the sailors from the rescue ship had seen no one else,\r\nand if there had been a boy on the island such a person would have been\r\nnear Mr. Dent. But no one was seen on the island, and so they thought it\r\nwas all a dream of Cousin Jasper's.\"\r\n\r\n\"And maybe that poor boy is there yet!\" exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"That's what my cousin is afraid of,\" her husband said. \"And that is why\r\nhe sent for me, his nearest relative. He knew I would believe him, and\r\nnot imagine he was dreaming. So he wants me to hire for him, as he is\r\nrich, a motor boat and go to this island to rescue the boy if he is\r\nstill there. Cousin Jasper thinks he is. He thinks the boy must have\r\nwandered away and so was not in sight when the rescue ship came, or\r\nperhaps he was asleep or ill further from the shore.\r\n\r\n\"At any rate that's Cousin Jasper's strange story. And now he wants us\r\nto help him see if it's true--see if the boy is still on the island\r\nwaiting to be rescued.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you find the island?\" asked Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Cousin Jasper says he will go with us and show us the way. The sea\r\ncaptain who called me up just now from down in the office of the hotel\r\nis a man who hires out motor boats. Cousin Jasper knows him, and sent\r\nhim to see me, as I am to have charge of everything, Mr. Dent not yet\r\nbeing strong enough to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"And are you going to do it?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" her husband said. \"I came here to help Cousin Jasper, and if\r\nhe wants me to set off on a sea voyage to rescue a poor lonely boy from\r\nan island, why I'll have to do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"May we go?\" eagerly asked Bert.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think so. Cousin Jasper says he wants me to get for him a big\r\nmotor boat--one large enough for all of us. We will have quite a long\r\ntrip on the deep, blue sea, and if we find that the boy has been taken\r\noff the island by some other ship, then we can have a good time sailing\r\nabout. But first we must go to the rescue.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's just like a story in a book!\" cried Nan, clapping her hands.\r\n\r\n\"Is they--are there oranges and bananas there?\" asked Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" his father asked.\r\n\r\n\"On the island where the boy is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know,\" answered Mr. Bobbsey. \"Perhaps bananas may grow\r\nthere, though I doubt it. It is hardly warm enough for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let's go anyhow,\" said Freddie. \"We can have some fun!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Flossie, who always wanted to do whatever her small brother\r\ndid, \"we can have some fun!\"\r\n\r\n\"But we are not going for fun--first of all,\" said Mr. Bobbsey. \"We are\r\ngoing to try to rescue this poor boy, who may be sick and alone on the\r\nisland. After we get him off, or find that he has been taken care of by\r\nsome one else, then we will think about good times.\r\n\r\n\"And now, my dear,\" said Mr. Bobbsey to his wife, \"the question is,\r\nwould you like to go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Will it be dangerous?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, I think not. No more so than coming down on the big ship. It is now\r\nsummer, and there are not many storms here then. And we shall be in a\r\nbig motor boat with a good captain and crew. Cousin Jasper told me to\r\ntell you that. We shall sail for a good part of the time--or, rather,\r\nmotor--around among islands, so each day we shall not be very far from\r\nsome land. Would you like to go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please say yes, Mother!\" begged Bert.\r\n\r\n\"We'd like to go!\" added Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" answered Mrs. Bobbsey slowly, \"it sounds as if it would be a\r\nnice trip. That is it will be nice if we can rescue this poor boy from\r\nthe lonely island. Yes,\" she said to her husband, \"I think we ought to\r\ngo. But it is strange that Cousin Jasper could not get any one from here\r\nto start out before this.\"\r\n\r\n\"They did not believe the tale he told of the boy having been left on\r\nthe island,\" said Mr. Bobbsey. \"They thought Cousin Jasper was still out\r\nof his head, and had, perhaps, dreamed this. He was very anxious to get\r\nsome one started in a boat for the island, but no one would go. So he\r\nhad to send for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you'll go!\" exclaimed Bert.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we'll all go. Now that I have told you Cousin Jasper's strange\r\nstory I'll go down and talk to the sea captain. I want to find out what\r\nsort of motor boat he has, and when we can get it.\"\r\n\r\n\"When are we going to start for the island?\" asked Bert.\r\n\r\n\"And what's the name of it?\" Nan questioned.\r\n\r\n\"Is it where Robinson Crusoe lived?\" queried Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"I'll have to take turns answering your questions,\" said Mr. Bobbsey\r\nwith a laugh. \"In the first place, Bert, we'll start as soon as we\r\ncan--that is as soon as Cousin Jasper is able to leave the hospital.\r\nThat will be within a few days, I think, as the doctor said a sea voyage\r\nwould do him good. And, too, the sooner we start the more quickly we\r\nshall know about this poor boy.\r\n\r\n\"As for the name of the island, I don't know that it has any. Cousin\r\nJasper didn't tell me, if it has. We can name it after we get there if\r\nwe find it has not already been called something. And I don't believe it\r\nis the island where Robinson Crusoe used to live, Freddie. So now that I\r\nhave answered all your questions, I think I'll go down and talk to the\r\ncaptain.\"\r\n\r\nFlossie and Freddie were in bed when their father came back upstairs,\r\nand Nan and Bert were getting ready for Slumberland, for it was their\r\nfirst day ashore after the voyage, and they were tired.\r\n\r\n\"Did you get the motor boat?\" asked Bert.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" his father answered with a laugh. \"I am to go to look at it\r\nin the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I come?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but go to bed now. It is getting late.\"\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Bobbsey stayed up a little longer, talking about many\r\nthings, and sending a few postcards to friends at home, telling of the\r\nsafe arrival in St. Augustine.\r\n\r\nFreddie was up early the next morning, standing with his nose flattened\r\nagainst the front window of the hotel rooms where the Bobbseys were\r\nstopping.\r\n\r\n\"I see one!\" he cried. \"I see one!\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" asked Flossie. \"A motor boat?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but another colored lady, and she's got an awful big basket on her\r\nhead. Come and look, Flossie! Maybe it'll fall off!\"\r\n\r\nBut nothing like that happened, and after breakfast Mr. Bobbsey\r\nsuggested that the whole family set out to see some of the sights of St.\r\nAugustine--the oldest city of the United States--and also to go to the\r\nwharf and view the motor boat.\r\n\r\n\"Can't we send some postcards before we start, Mother?\" questioned Nan\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" returned Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"I think I'll send a few to my friends,\" said Bert, and he and Nan spent\r\nsome time picking out the postcards.\r\n\r\nEven Flossie insisted upon it that she be allowed to send several to her\r\nbest friends at home.\r\n\r\nI wish I had room to tell you all the things the children saw--the queer\r\nold streets and houses, the forts and rivers, for there are two rivers\r\nnear the old city. But the Bobbsey twins were as anxious as I know you\r\nmust be to see the motor boat, and hear more about the trip to the\r\nisland to save the lonely boy, so I will go on to that part of our\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE DEEP BLUE SEA\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Glad to see you! Glad to see you! Come right on board!\" cried a hearty\r\nvoice, as the Bobbsey twins and their father and mother walked down the\r\nlong dock which ran out into the harbor of St. Augustine.\r\n\r\n\"That's Captain Crane, with whom I was talking last night,\" said Mr.\r\nBobbsey to his wife in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"And is that the boat we are to take the trip in?\" she asked, for the\r\nseaman was standing on the deck of a fine motor craft, dark red in\r\ncolor, and with shiny brass rails. A cabin, with white curtains at the\r\nportholes, or windows, seemed to offer a good resting place.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's the _Swallow_, as Captain Crane calls his boat,\" Mr.\r\nBobbsey said.\r\n\r\n\"She's a beaut!\" exclaimed Bert.\r\n\r\n\"Come on board! Come on board! Glad to see you!\" called the old captain\r\nagain, as he waved his hand to the Bobbseys.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I like him, don't you?\" whispered Nan to Bert.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he replied. \"He's fine; and that's a dandy boat!\"\r\n\r\nIndeed the _Swallow_ was a beautiful craft. She was about eighty feet\r\nlong, and wide enough to give plenty of room on board, and also to be\r\nsafe in a storm. There was a big cabin \"forward,\" as the seamen say, or\r\nin the front part of the boat, and another \"aft,\" or at the stern, or\r\nback part. This was for the men who looked after the gasolene motor and\r\nran the boat, while the captain and the passengers would live in the\r\nfront cabin, out of which opened several little staterooms, or places\r\nwhere bunks were built for sleeping.\r\n\r\nThe _Swallow_ was close to the dock, so one could step right on board\r\nwithout any trouble, and the children were soon standing on the deck,\r\nlooking about them.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I like this!\" cried Freddie. \"It's a nicer boat than the _Sea\r\nQueen_!\" This was the name of the big steamer on which they had come\r\nfrom New York. \"Have you got a fire engine here, Captain?\" asked the\r\nlittle Bobbsey twin.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, we've a pump to use in case of fire, but I hope we won't have\r\nany,\" the seaman said. \"I don't s'pose you'd call it a fire engine,\r\nthough, but we couldn't have that on a motor boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I guess not,\" Freddie agreed, after thinking it over a bit. \"I've a\r\nlittle fire engine at home,\" he went on, \"and it squirts real water.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he squirted some on me,\" put in Flossie. \"On me and my doll.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I didn't mean to--an' it was only play,\" Freddie explained.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it was only in fun, and I didn't mind very much,\" went on the\r\nlittle girl. \"My rubber doll--she likes water,\" she added, holding out\r\nthe doll in question for Captain Crane to see.\r\n\r\n\"That's good!\" he said with a smile. \"When we get out on the ocean you\r\ncan tie a string around her waist, and let her have a swim in the\r\nwaves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't a shark get her?\" Flossie demanded.\r\n\r\n\"No, I guess sharks don't like to chew on rubber dolls,\" laughed Captain\r\nCrane. \"Anyhow we'll try to keep out of their way. But make yourselves\r\nat home, folks. I hope you'll be with me for quite a while, and you may\r\nas well get used to the boat. Mr. Dent has sailed in her many times, and\r\nhe likes the _Swallow_ first rate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can she go fast?\" asked Bert.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she can fairly skim over the waves, and that's why I call her the\r\n_Swallow_,\" replied the seaman. \"As soon as Mr. Dent heard I was on\r\nshore, waiting for some one to hire my boat, he told me not to sail\r\nagain until you folks came, as you and he were going on a voyage\r\ntogether. I hope you are going?\" and he looked at Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we have made up our minds to go,\" said the children's father. \"We\r\nare going to look for a boy who may be all alone on one of the islands\r\noff the Florida coast. We hope we can rescue him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so, too,\" said Captain Crane. \"I was shipwrecked on one of those\r\nislands myself, once, as your Cousin Jasper was. And it was dreadful\r\nthere, and I got terribly lonesome before I was taken off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you have a goat?\" asked Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"No, my little girl, I didn't have a goat,\" answered Mr. Crane. \"Why do\r\nyou ask that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because Robinson Crusoe was on an island like that and he had a goat,\"\r\nFlossie went on.\r\n\r\n\"When you were shipwrecked did you have to eat your shoes?\" Freddie\r\nqueried.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, ho! No, I guess not!\" laughed Captain Crane. \"I see what you mean.\r\nYou must have had read to you stories of sailors that got so hungry,\r\nafter being shipwrecked, that they had to boil their leather shoes to\r\nmake soup. Well, I wasn't quite so bad off as that. I found some oysters\r\non my island, and I had a little food with me. And that, with a spring\r\nof water I found, kept me alive until a ship came and took me off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I hope the poor boy on the island where Cousin Jasper was is\r\nstill alive, or else that he has been rescued,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"I hope so, too,\" said the captain. \"Now come and I'll show you about my\r\nboat.\"\r\n\r\nHe was very proud of his craft, which was a beautiful one, and also\r\nstrong enough to stand quite a hard storm. There was plenty of room on\r\nboard for the whole Bobbsey family, as well as for Mr. Dent, besides a\r\ncrew of three men and the captain. There were cute little bedrooms for\r\nthe children, a larger room for Mr. and Mrs. Bobbsey, one for the\r\ncaptain and there was even a bathroom.\r\n\r\nThere was also a kitchen, called a cook's galley, and another room that\r\ncould be used in turn for a parlor, a sitting-room or a dining-room.\r\nThis was the main cabin, and as you know there is not room enough on a\r\nmotor boat to have a lot of rooms, one has to be used for different\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\"What do you call this room?\" questioned Flossie, as she looked around\r\nat the tiny compartment.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you can call this most anything,\" laughed the captain. \"When you\r\nuse it for company, it's a parlor; and when you use it for just sitting\r\naround in, it's a sitting-room; and when you use it to eat in, why, then\r\nwhat would you call it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then you'd call it a dining-room,\" answered the little girl\r\npromptly.\r\n\r\n\"And if I got my hair cut in it, then it would be a barber shop,\r\nwouldn't it?\" cried Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Freddie Bobbsey!\" gasped his twin. \"I'm sure I wouldn't want my\r\ndining-room to be a barber shop,\" she added disdainfully.\r\n\r\n\"Well, some places have got to be barber shops,\" defended the little boy\r\nstaunchly.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think they have barber shops on motor boats, do they, Daddy?\"\r\n\r\n\"They might have if the boat was big enough,\" answered Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\"However, I don't believe we'll have a barber shop on this craft.\"\r\n\r\n\"When are we going to start?\" asked Bert, when they had gone all over\r\nthe _Swallow_, even to the place where the crew slept and where the\r\nmotors were.\r\n\r\n\"We will start as soon as Cousin Jasper is ready,\" said Mr. Bobbsey. \"It\r\nmay be a week yet, I hope no longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I, for the sake of that poor boy on the island,\" said Mrs.\r\nBobbsey. \"Tell me, has nothing been heard of him since he was\r\nshipwrecked there with Mr. Dent?\" she asked Captain Crane. \"Has no other\r\nvessel stopped there but the one that took off Cousin Jasper?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess not,\" answered Captain Crane. \"According to Mr. Dent's tell,\r\nthis island isn't much known, being one of the smallest. It was only\r\nbecause the men on the ship that took him off saw his flag that they\r\nstood in and got him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then they didn't find the boy,\" said Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he wasn't there,\" Captain Crane said. \"He might have found an\r\nold boat, or made one of part of the wrecked motor boat, and have gone\r\naway by himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he may be there yet, half starved and all alone,\" said Mrs.\r\nBobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he may be,\" admitted the old seaman. \"But we'll soon find out. Mr.\r\nJasper Dent is very anxious to start and look for this boy, who had\r\nworked for him about two years on his boat. So we won't lose any time in\r\nstarting, I guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how do you like my boat? That's what your cousin will be sure to\r\nask you. When he heard that you were coming to see him, and heard that I\r\nwas free to take a trip, he wanted you folks to see me and look over the\r\n_Swallow_. Now you've done it, how do you like it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very much indeed,\" said Mr. Bobbsey. \"We like the boat exceedingly!\"\r\n\r\n\"And the captain, too,\" added Mrs. Bobbsey, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you kindly, lady!\" said the seaman, with a smile and a bow. \"I\r\nhope we'll get along well together.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I like the water pump!\" exclaimed Freddie. \"Please may I squirt the\r\nhose some day?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess so, when it's nice and warm, and when we wash down the decks,\"\r\nsaid Captain Crane. \"We use the pump for that quite a lot,\" he added.\r\n\"We haven't had to use it for fire yet, and I hope we never have to.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what we all say,\" put in Mr. Bobbsey. But no one could tell what\r\nmight happen.\r\n\r\nThe Bobbsey twins went about the _Swallow_ as they pleased, having a\r\ngood time picking out the rooms they wanted to sleep in. Bert said he\r\nwas going to learn how to run the big gasolene motors, and Freddie said\r\nhe was going to learn how to steer, as well as squirt water through the\r\ndeck hose.\r\n\r\n\"I want to cook in the cute little kitchen,\" said Nan.\r\n\r\n\"And I'll help set table,\" offered Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have a good time when we get to sea in this boat,\" declared Bert.\r\n\r\n\"And I hope we find that boy on the island,\" added Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I hope that, too,\" agreed Bert.\r\n\r\nNone of the crew of the _Swallow_ was on board yet, Captain Crane not\r\nhaving any need for the men when the boat was tied up at the dock.\r\n\r\n\"But I can get 'em as soon as you say the word,\" he told Mrs. Bobbsey\r\nwhen she asked him.\r\n\r\n\"And what about things to eat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we'll stow the victuals on board before we sail,\" said the seaman.\r\n\"We'll take plenty to eat, even though lots of it has to be canned. Just\r\nsay the word when you're ready to start, and I'll have everything\r\nready.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now we'll go see Cousin Jasper,\" suggested Mr. Bobbsey, when at\r\nlast he had managed to get the children off the boat. \"He will be\r\nwondering what has become of us.\"\r\n\r\nThey went to the hospital, and found Mr. Dent much better. The coming of\r\nthe Bobbseys had acted as a tonic, the doctor said.\r\n\r\n\"Do you like the _Swallow_ and Captain Crane?\" asked the sick man, who\r\nwas now getting well.\r\n\r\n\"Very much,\" answered Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"And will you go with him and me to look for Jack Nelson?\"\r\n\r\n\"As soon as you are ready,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\n\"Then we'll start in a few days,\" decided Cousin Jasper. \"The sea-trip\r\nwill make me entirely well, sooner than anything else.\"\r\n\r\nThe hospital doctor thought this also, and toward the end of the week\r\nMr. Dent was allowed to go to his own home. He lived alone, except for a\r\nhousekeeper and Jack Nelson, but Jack, of course, was not with him now,\r\nbeing, they hoped, either on the island or safely rescued.\r\n\r\n\"Though if he had been taken off,\" said Mr. Dent, \"he would have sent me\r\nword that he was all right. So I feel he must still be on the island.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the ship that took him off--if one did,\" said Mr. Bobbsey,\r\n\"started to sail around the world, and it will be a long while before\r\nyou hear from your friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he could send some word,\" said Cousin Jasper. \"No, I feel quite\r\nsure he is still on the island.\"\r\n\r\nJust as soon as Mr. Bobbsey's cousin was strong enough to take the trip\r\nin the _Swallow_, the work of getting the motor boat ready for the sea\r\nwent quickly on. Captain Crane got the crew on board, and they cleaned\r\nand polished until, as Mrs. Bobbsey said, you could almost see your face\r\nin the deck.\r\n\r\nPlenty of food and water was stored on board, for at sea the water is\r\nsalt and cannot be used for drinking. The Bobbseys, after having seen\r\nall they wanted to in St. Augustine, moved most of their baggage to the\r\nboat, and Cousin Jasper went on board also.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess we're all ready to start,\" said Captain Crane one\r\nmorning. \"Everything has been done that can be done, and we have enough\r\nto eat for a month or more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even if we are shipwrecked?\" Freddie questioned.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, little fat fireman,\" laughed the captain. \"Even if we are\r\nshipwrecked. Now, all aboard!\"\r\n\r\nThey were all present, the crew and the Bobbseys, Captain Crane and\r\nCousin Jasper.\r\n\r\n\"All aboard!\" cried the captain again.\r\n\r\nA bell jingled, a whistle tooted and the _Swallow_ began to move away\r\nfrom the dock. She dropped down the river and, a little later, was out\r\non the ocean.\r\n\r\n\"Once more the deep, blue sea, children!\" said Mrs. Bobbsey. \"Shall you\r\nlike the voyage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very much!\" cried Nan, and the others nodded their heads to agree\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as they were puffing along, one of the crew called to Captain\r\nCrane:\r\n\r\n\"There's a man in that motor boat who wants to speak to you! Better wait\r\nand see what he wants!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nFLOSSIE'S DOLL\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Crane jingled a bell that told the engineer of the motor boat to\r\nslow down. Then he steered the _Swallow_ over toward the other motor\r\nboat in which was a man waving his hand, as though he wanted the\r\nBobbseys to stop, or at least to come closer, so that he might speak to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe Bobbsey twins were wildly excited.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Captain Harrison!\" called Captain Crane, as soon as the two\r\nboats were close enough to talk from one to the other. \"Did you want to\r\nsee me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes, I did,\" answered Captain Harrison, who was on the other\r\nmotor boat, which was named _Sea Foam_. \"I think I have some news for\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope it's good news,\" Captain Crane made reply.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I believe it is. Are you going out to rescue a boy from an island\r\nquite a way to the south of us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, these friends of mine are going,\" answered Captain Crane, pointing\r\nto the Bobbseys and to Cousin Jasper, who were sitting on the deck under\r\nthe shade of an awning. \"But how did you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"I just passed Captain Peters in his boat, and he told me about your\r\nstarting off on a voyage,\" went on Captain Harrison. \"As soon as I heard\r\nwhat you were going to do, I made up my mind to tell you what I saw. I\r\npassed that island, where you are going to look for a lost man----\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a lost boy, and not a lost man,\" interrupted Captain Crane.\r\n\r\n\"Well, lost boy, then,\" went on Captain Harrison. \"Anyhow, I passed that\r\nisland the other day, and I'm sure I saw some one running up and down on\r\nthe shore, waving a rag or something.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did!\" cried Cousin Jasper, who, with the Bobbseys, was listening to\r\nthis talk. \"Then why in the world didn't you go on shore and get Jack?\r\nWhy didn't you do that, Captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I couldn't,\" answered Captain Harrison. \"A big storm was coming\r\nup, and I couldn't get near the place on account of the rocks. But I\r\nlooked through my telescope, and I'm sure I saw a man--or, as you say,\r\nmaybe it was a boy--running up and down on the shore of the island,\r\nwaving something.\r\n\r\n\"When I found I couldn't get near the place, on account of the rocks and\r\nthe big waves, I made up my mind to go back as soon as I could. But the\r\nstorm kept up, and part of my motor engine broke, so I had to come back\r\nhere to get it fixed.\r\n\r\n\"I just got in, after a lot of trouble, and the first bit of news I\r\nheard was that you were going to start off for this island to look for\r\nsome one there. So I thought I'd tell you there is some one on the\r\nshore--at least there was a week ago, when I saw the place.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bobbsey twins listened \"with all their ears\" to this talk, and they\r\nwondered what would happen next.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if Captain Harrison saw Jack there he must be alive,\" said Bert\r\nto Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Unless something happened to him afterward in the storm,\" remarked Nan.\r\n\r\n\"I wish we could hurry up and get him,\" said Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"Be quiet, children,\" whispered Mrs. Bobbsey. \"Captain Crane wants to\r\nhear all that the other captain says.\"\r\n\r\n\"S-sh,\" hissed Flossie importantly.\r\n\r\n\"How long ago was this?\" asked Captain Crane.\r\n\r\n\"About a week,\" answered Captain Harrison. \"I had trouble getting back,\r\nso it was a week ago. I tried to see some other boat to send to the\r\nisland to take off this lost boy, but I didn't meet any until I got\r\nhere. Somebody on shore told me about you. Then I thought, as long as\r\nyou are going there, I'd tell you what I saw.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you did,\" observed Cousin Jasper. \"And I'm glad to know that\r\nJack is well enough to be up and around--or that he was when you saw\r\nhim. We must go there as fast as we can now, and rescue him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe some other boat stopped and took him off the island,\" said\r\nCaptain Harrison.\r\n\r\n\"Well, maybe one did,\" agreed Cousin Jasper. \"If so, that's all the\r\nbetter. But if Jack is still there we'll get him. Thank you, Captain\r\nHarrison.\"\r\n\r\nThen the two motor boats started up again, one to go on to her dock at\r\nSt. Augustine and the other--the one with the Bobbsey twins on\r\nboard--heading for the deep blue sea which lay beyond.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think you can find Jack?\" asked Freddie, as he stood beside\r\nCaptain Crane, who was steering the _Swallow_.\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes, little fat fireman. I hope so,\" was the answer. \"If Captain\r\nHarrison saw him running around the island, waving something for a flag,\r\nthat shows he was alive, anyhow, and not sick, as he was when the folks\r\ntook Mr. Dent off. So that's a good sign.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it was more than a week ago,\" said Mr. Bobbsey. \"Of course we all\r\nhope he can be found, but we must hurry as fast as we can.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" said Cousin Jasper. \"Make the boat go as fast as you\r\ncan, Captain Crane.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" answered the seaman. \"You'll see how quickly my _Swallow_ can\r\nskim over the waves.\"\r\n\r\nNow that they were started on their voyage over the sea the Bobbsey\r\ntwins had a good chance to get better acquainted with Cousin Jasper.\r\nThere had been so much to do in getting ready for the trip and in\r\nleaving the hotel that they had hardly spoken to him, or he to them.\r\n\r\nBut now that they were all on board the motor boat, and there was\r\nnowhere else to go, and nothing to do, except to sit around on deck, or\r\neat when the meal times came, there was a chance to see Cousin Jasper\r\nbetter and to talk with him more.\r\n\r\n\"I like him,\" said Freddie, as the four twins sat together under an\r\nawning out of the sun, and listened to the conversation of the older\r\nfolk, who were talking about the news given them by Captain Harrison. \"I\r\nlike Cousin Jasper!\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I. And he likes my rubber doll,\" said Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"What makes you think he likes your doll?\" asked Nan, with a laugh at\r\nher little sister.\r\n\r\n\"'Cause when I dropped her on the floor in the cabin he picked her up\r\nfor me and asked if she was hurt.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't hurt a rubber doll!\" exclaimed Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"I know you can't,\" said Flossie, \"'ceptin' maybe when you pretend, and\r\nI wasn't doing that then. But Cousin Jasper brushed the dust off my\r\ndoll, and he liked her.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was nice of him,\" said Bert. \"I like Captain Crane, too. He's\r\ngoing to let me steer the boat, maybe, when we get out where there\r\naren't any other ships for me to knock into.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he's going to let me run the engine--maybe,\" added Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you'd better be careful how you run it,\" laughed Bert. \"It's a\r\ngood deal bigger than your fire engine.\"\r\n\r\nSo the Bobbsey twins talked about Cousin Jasper and Captain Crane, and\r\nthey were sure they would like both men. As for Cousin Jasper, he really\r\nloved the little folk, and had a warm place in his heart for them,\r\nthough he had not seen any of them since they were small babies.\r\n\r\nOn and on puffed the _Swallow_, over the deep blue sea, drawing nearer\r\nto the island where they hoped to find Jack Nelson.\r\n\r\n\"But it will take us some little time to get there, even if nothing\r\nhappens,\" said Cousin Jasper, as they all sat down to dinner in the\r\ncabin a little later. The meal was a good one, and Nan and her mother\r\nwere quite surprised that so much could be cooked in the little kitchen,\r\nor \"galley,\" as Captain Crane called it, for on a ship that is the name\r\nof the kitchen.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of the crew was the cook, and he also helped about\r\nthe boat, polishing the shiny brass rails, and doing other things, for\r\nthere is as much work about a boat as there is about a house, as Nan's\r\nmother said to her.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mother, I can see that there is a lot of work to do around a boat\r\nlike this, especially if they wish to keep it in really nice style,\"\r\nsaid Nan. \"The sailors have to work just about as hard as the servants\r\ndo around a house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my dear, and they have to work in all sorts of weather, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we have to work in the house even in bad weather.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true. But the sailors on a boat often have to work outside on\r\nthe deck when the weather is very rough.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that must be awfully dangerous,\" put in Bert.\r\n\r\n\"It does become dangerous at times, especially when there is a great\r\nstorm on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think we'll run into a storm on this trip?\" Nan questioned.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I hope not!\" answered the mother quickly. \"To run into a big\r\nstorm with such a small boat as this would be dangerous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe we'd be wrecked and become regular Robinson Crusoes,\" said Bert.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, please, Bert! don't speak of such dreadful things!\" said his\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n\"But that would be fun, Mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fun!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. We won't be wrecked then.\" And Bert and his mother both\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the Bobbsey twins sat out on the deck, and watched the blue\r\nwaves. For some little time they could look back and see the shores of\r\nFlorida, and then, as the _Swallow_ flew farther and farther away, the\r\nshores were only like a misty cloud, and then, a little longer, and they\r\ncould not be seen at all.\r\n\r\n\"Now we are just as much at sea as when we were on the big ship coming\r\nfrom New York, aren't we?\" Bert asked his father.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, just about,\" answered Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\nIt was a little while after this that Mrs. Bobbsey, who had gone down to\r\nthe staterooms, to get a book she had left there, heard Flossie crying.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, little fairy?\" asked her mother, as she came up on\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mother, my nice rubber doll is gone, and Freddie took her and now\r\nhe's gone,\" said Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"Freddie gone!\" cried Mrs. Bobbsey. \"What do you mean, Flossie? Where\r\ncould Freddie go?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know where he went. I guess he didn't go to look at any colored\r\nladies with baskets on their heads, 'cause there aren't any here. But he\r\nwent downstairs, where the engine is, and he took my doll with him. I\r\nsaw him, and I hollered at him, but he wouldn't bring her back to me.\r\nOh, I want my doll--my nice rubber doll!\" and Flossie cried real tears.\r\n\r\n\"I must find Freddie,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey. \"I wonder where that boy could\r\nhave gone this time?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nFREDDIE'S FISH\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough she was a little worried about Freddie, Mrs. Bobbsey felt quite\r\nsure nothing very serious could happen to him. He would not go near\r\nenough the railing of the deck to fall over, for he and Flossie, as well\r\nas Bert and Nan, had promised not to do this while they were on the\r\n_Swallow_. And if the little boy had gone \"downstairs,\" as Flossie said,\r\nhe could be in no danger there.\r\n\r\n\"Even if he went to the motor room,\" thought Mrs. Bobbsey, \"he could\r\ncome to no harm, for there is a man there all the while looking after\r\nthe engine. But I must find him.\"\r\n\r\nFlossie was still sobbing a little, and looking about the deck as if, by\r\nsome chance, her doll might still be there.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me how it happened, Flossie,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\nHer husband was down in the cabin, talking to Captain Crane and Cousin\r\nJasper. The cook was getting things ready for supper, one of the men was\r\nsteering, and another was looking after the engine. Nan and Bert were up\r\nin the bow of the boat, watching the waves and an occasional seagull\r\nflying about, and Flossie was with her mother. The only one of her\r\nfamily Mrs. Bobbsey did not know about was Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"It happened this way,\" said Flossie. \"I was playing up here with my\r\nrubber doll, making believe she was a princess, and I was putting a gold\r\nand diamond dress on her, when Freddie came up with a lot of string. I\r\nasked him what he was going to do, and he said he was going to fish, and\r\nhe asked me if I had a piece of cookie.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he want of a piece of cookie?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"He wanted it to fasten on his line for bait for the fishes, he said,\"\r\nwent on Flossie. \"But I didn't have any cookie. I did have some before\r\nthat, and so did Freddie. The cook gave them to us, but I did eat all my\r\npiece up and so did Freddie. So I didn't have any for his fishline.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what happened?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey, as she started down the\r\ncompanionway to look for Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Freddie asked me to go and get some more cookie from the cook,\r\nand I did, 'cause I was hungry and I wanted to eat more. But I couldn't\r\nfind the cook, and when I came back upstairs again, and outdoors--here\r\non deck, I mean--I saw Freddie grab up my doll, and run down the other\r\nstairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, maybe he only took it in fun,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey, and she was\r\nnot at all worried now, feeling sure Freddie was safe, though he might\r\nbe in some sort of mischief.\r\n\r\n\"Anyhow he took my doll,\" Flossie went on. \"And he wouldn't bring her\r\nback to me when I told him to. Then I--I cried.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I heard you,\" said her mother. \"But you mustn't be such a baby,\r\nFlossie. Of course it wasn't right for Freddie to take your doll, but\r\nyou shouldn't have cried about a little thing like that. I'll tell him\r\nhe mustn't plague you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Mother! he was going to throw my doll into the ocean, I'm sure he\r\nwas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, Flossie! Freddie wouldn't do a thing like that!\"\r\n\r\n\"But I saw him tying a string to her, and I'm sure he was going to throw\r\nher into the ocean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then he could pull her out again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I don't want my doll in the ocean. The ocean is salty, and if\r\nsalty water gets in her eyes it might spoil them.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Bobbsey wanted to laugh, but she did not dare, for that would have\r\nmade Flossie feel worse than ever.\r\n\r\n\"What makes you think Freddie was going to toss your doll into the\r\nocean?\" asked Flossie's mother.\r\n\r\n\"'Cause, before that he wanted me to do it to give her a bath. He had a\r\nlong string and he said, 'let's tie it to the rubber doll and let her\r\nswim in the ocean.'\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he mustn't do that, of course,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey. \"And I'll tell\r\nhim so when I find him. But perhaps he didn't do it, Flossie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes he did!\" said the little girl. \"When he ran downstairs with my\r\ndoll, and wouldn't come back when I hollered at him, he was tying a\r\nstring on her then. Oh, dear!\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind! I'll get your doll back,\" Mrs. Bobbsey said. \"But first we\r\nmust find Freddie.\"\r\n\r\n\"He went down those stairs,\" said Flossie, pointing to a flight that led\r\nto the motor room, where the engine was chug-chugging away, sending the\r\n_Swallow_ over the waves. \"He went down there.\"\r\n\r\nThe engine room of the motor boat was a clean place, not like the engine\r\nroom on a steamboat, filled with coal dust and a lot of machinery, and\r\nMrs. Bobbsey knew it would be all right for her and Flossie to go down\r\nthere and see what Freddie was doing.\r\n\r\n\"Now don't cry any more,\" Flossie's mother told her, giving the little\r\ngirl a handkerchief on which to dry her tears. \"We'll get your doll\r\nback, and I'll have to scold Freddie a little, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe you can't find him,\" said Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes I can,\" her mother declared.\r\n\r\n\"You can't find him if he is hiding away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think he will dare hide if he hears me calling him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe he will if he's got my doll,\" pouted Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Flossie, you mustn't talk that way. I don't believe Freddie meant\r\nto be naughty. He was only heedless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I want my doll!\"\r\n\r\nIt was no easy matter for little Flossie to get down into the engine\r\nroom of the motor boat. The little iron stairway was very steep, and the\r\nsteps seemed to be very far apart.\r\n\r\n\"Let me help you, Flossie,\" said her mother. \"I don't want you to fall\r\nand get yourself dirty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mother, it isn't a bit dirty down here!\" the little girl returned.\r\n\"Why, it's just as clean as it can be!\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, there may be some oil around.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be very careful. But please let me go down all by myself,\"\r\nanswered the little girl.\r\n\r\nShe was getting at that age now when she liked to do a great many things\r\nfor herself. Often when there was a muddy place to cross in the street,\r\ninstead of taking hold of somebody's hand Flossie would make a leap\r\nacross the muddy place by herself.\r\n\r\nKnowing how much her little girl was disturbed over the loss of her\r\ndoll, Mrs. Bobbsey, at this time, allowed her to have her own way. And\r\nslowly and carefully the stout little girl lowered herself from one step\r\nof the iron ladder to the next until she stood on the floor of the\r\nengine room.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I got down all right, didn't I?\" she remarked triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my dear, you came down very nicely,\" the mother answered.\r\n\r\nDown in the engine room a man was oiling the machinery. He looked up as\r\nMrs. Bobbsey and Flossie came down the stairs.\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen my little boy?\" asked Freddie's mother. \"My little girl\r\nsays he came down here.\"\r\n\r\n\"So he did,\" answered the engineer. \"I asked him if he was coming to\r\nhelp me run the boat, and he said he would a little later. He had\r\nsomething else to do now, it seems.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"Well, he said he wanted to go fishing. And as I knew you wouldn't want\r\nhim leaning over the rail I showed him where he could fish out of one of\r\nthe portholes of the storeroom. A porthole is one of the round windows,\"\r\nthe engineer said, so Flossie would know what he was talking about. \"I\r\nopened one of the ports for him, and said he could drop his line out of\r\nthat. Then he couldn't come to any harm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he have a line?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a good, strong one. I guess he must have got it off Captain Crane.\r\nHe's a fisherman himself, the captain is, and he has lots of hooks and\r\nlines on board.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I hope Freddie didn't have a hook!\" cried Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"No'm,\" answered the engineer. \"I didn't see any, and I don't think he\r\ndid have any. He just had a long string, and I thought all he was going\r\nto do was to dangle it out of the porthole in the storeroom. He couldn't\r\ncome to any harm there, I knew, and I could keep my eye on him once in a\r\nwhile.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he have my rubber doll?\" asked Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't see any doll,\" answered the engineer. \"But he's in there now,\"\r\nhe went on. \"You can ask him yourself.\"\r\n\r\nLooking out of the engine room, Freddie could be seen farther back in\r\nthe motor boat, in a place where boxes and barrels of food, and things\r\nfor the boat, were kept. One of the side ports was open, and Freddie's\r\nhead was stuck out of this, so he could not see his mother and Flossie\r\nand the engineer looking at him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm glad he's all right,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey with a sigh of\r\nrelief. \"Thank you for looking after him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I like children,\" said the man with a smile. \"I have some little\r\nones of my own at home.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Bobbsey and Flossie went into the storeroom. Freddie did not hear\r\nthem, for his head was still out of the round window. There was no\r\ndanger of his falling out, for he could not have got his shoulders\r\nthrough, so Mrs. Bobbsey was not frightened, even though the little boy\r\nwas leaning right over deep water, through which the _Swallow_ was\r\ngliding.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, where is my doll?\" asked Flossie, looking about and not seeing it.\r\n\"I want my rubber doll!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll ask Freddie,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey, and then, in a louder voice, she\r\ncalled:\r\n\r\n\"Freddie! Freddie! Where is Flossie's doll? You mustn't take it away\r\nfrom her. I shall have to punish you for this!\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment it seemed as if the little boy had not heard what his\r\nmother had said. Then, when she called him again, he pulled his head in\r\nfrom the porthole and whispered:\r\n\r\n\"Please don't make a noise, Mother! I'm fishing, and a noise always\r\nscares the fish away!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Freddie, fishing or not, you mustn't take Flossie's playthings,\"\r\nhis mother went on.\r\n\r\nFreddie did not answer for a moment. He had wound around his hand part\r\nof a heavy cord, which Mrs. Bobbsey knew was a line used to catch big\r\nfish. Freddie was really trying to catch something, it seemed.\r\n\r\n\"Is there a hook on that line?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey, fearing, after all,\r\nthat her little boy might have found one.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, Mother, there's no hook,\" Freddie answered. \"I just tied\r\non----\" And then a queer look came over his face. His hand, with the\r\nline wound around it, was jerked toward the open porthole and the little\r\nboy cried:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I got a fish! I got a fish! I got a big fish!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\"LAND HO!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Bobbsey at first did not know whether Freddie was playing some of\r\nhis make-believe games, or whether he really had caught a fish.\r\nCertainly something seemed to be pulling on the line he held out of the\r\nporthole, but then, his mother thought, it might have caught on\r\nsomething, as fishlines often do get caught.\r\n\r\n\"I've caught a fish! I've caught a fish!\" Freddie cried again. \"Oh,\r\nplease somebody come and help me pull it in!\"\r\n\r\nFlossie was so excited--almost as much as was her brother--that she\r\nforgot all about her lost doll.\r\n\r\n\"Have you really caught a fish?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"I really have! I guess maybe it's a shark or a whale, it's so big, and\r\nit pulls so hard!\" cried Freddie.\r\n\r\nAnd, really, the line that was wound around his hand was pulled so\r\ntight, and stretched so hard, where it went out of the hole and down\r\ninto the ocean, that Freddie could not lower his fist.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Freddie!\" cried his mother. \"If you have caught a fish it may cut\r\nyour fingers by jerking on that line.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I--I caught something!\" Freddie said. \"Please somebody get it off\r\nmy line. And hurry, please!\"\r\n\r\nBy this time Nan and Bert had run down into the storeroom. They saw what\r\nwas going on.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure you haven't caught another hat?\" asked Bert, as he\r\nremembered what had once happened to his little brother.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't pull like a hat,\" Freddie answered. \"It's a real fish.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe he has caught something,\" said Mr. Chase, the engineer, as he\r\nran in from the motor room. \"Yes, it's either a fish or a turtle,\" he\r\nadded as he caught hold of the line and took some of the pull off\r\nFreddie's hand. \"Unwind that cord from your fingers,\" he told the little\r\nboy. \"I'll take care of your fish--if you really have one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could it be a turtle?\" asked Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there are lots of 'em in these waters,\" the engineer said. \"But I\r\nnever knew one of 'em to bite on just a piece of string before, without\r\neven a hook or a bit of bait on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I got something on my line for bait,\" Freddie answered.\r\n\r\nBut no one paid any attention to him just then, for the engineer, gently\r\nthrusting the little boy aside, looked from the porthole himself, and\r\nwhat he saw made him cry:\r\n\r\n\"The little lad has caught something all right. Would you mind running\r\nup on deck and telling Captain Crane your brother has caught something,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Chase to Bert. \"And tell him, if he wants to get it aboard he'd\r\nbetter tell one of the men to stand by with a long-handled net. I think\r\nit's a turtle or a big fish, and it'll be good to eat whatever it\r\nis--unless it's a shark, and some folks eat them nowadays.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't want to catch a shark!\" exclaimed Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"It's already caught, whatever it is,\" said Mr. Chase, \"It seems to be\r\nwell hooked, too, whatever you used on the end of your line.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tied on a----\" began Freddie, but, once again, no one paid attention\r\nto what he said, for the fish, or whatever it was on the end of the\r\nline, began to squirm in the water, \"squiggle\" Freddie called it\r\nafterward--and the engineer had to hold tightly to the line.\r\n\r\n\"Please hurry and tell the captain to reach the net overboard and pull\r\nthis fish in,\" begged Mr. Chase of Bert. \"I'd pull it in through the\r\nporthole, but I'm afraid it will get off if I try.\"\r\n\r\nAll this while the _Swallow_ was moving slowly along through the blue\r\nwaters of the deep sea, for when the engineer had run in to see what\r\nFreddie had caught he had shut down the motor so that it moved at a\r\nquarter speed.\r\n\r\nUp on deck ran Bert, to find his father and Captain Crane there talking\r\nwith Cousin Jasper.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Bert?\" asked Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, will you please get out a net, Captain!\" cried Nan's brother.\r\n\"Freddie has caught a big fish through the porthole and the\r\nengineer--Mr. Chase--is holding it now, and he can't pull it in, and\r\nwill you do it with a net?\"\r\n\r\n\"My! that's a funny thing to have happen!\" said Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"I'll get the net!\" cried Captain Crane. \"If your brother has really\r\ncaught a fish or a turtle we can have it for dinner. I wouldn't be\r\nsurprised if it was a turtle,\" said the captain to Bert's father. \"There\r\nare plenty around where we are sailing now, and they'll sometimes bite\r\non a bare hook, though they like something to eat better. What bait did\r\nFreddie use?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" Bert answered.\r\n\r\nBy this time Captain Crane had found a large net, which had a long\r\nhandle fast to it, and also a rope, so that if the fish were so large\r\nthat the handle should break in lifting it from the water, the rope\r\nwould hold.\r\n\r\nWith the net ready to dip down into the water, Captain Crane ran along\r\nthe deck until he stood above the porthole, out of which ran the line.\r\nThe fish, or whatever it was, was still fast to the other end of the\r\nstrong cord.\r\n\r\n\"Haul it up as close as you can to the side of the boat!\" called the\r\ncaptain to the engineer, who thrust his head partly out of the round\r\nhole. \"Then I'll scoop it up in the net. Watch out he doesn't get off\r\nthe hook.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the trouble,\" said the engineer. \"I don't believe Freddie used a\r\nhook. But we'll soon see.\"\r\n\r\nUp on the deck of the _Swallow_, as well as down in the storeroom, where\r\nFreddie, his mother and the others were watching, there was an anxious\r\nmoment. They all wanted to see what it was the little boy had caught.\r\n\r\n\"Here we go, now!\" cried Captain Crane, as he lowered the long-handled\r\nnet into the water near the cord. The captain held to the wooden handle,\r\nand Mr. Bobbsey had hold of the rope.\r\n\r\nThrough the porthole Mr. Chase pulled on the cord until he had brought\r\nthe flapping, struggling captive close to the side of the motor boat.\r\nThen, with a sudden scoop, Captain Crane slipped the net under it.\r\n\r\n\"Now pull!\" he cried, and both he and Mr. Bobbsey did this.\r\n\r\nUp out of the blue sea rose something in the net. And as the sun shone\r\non the glistening sides Freddie, peering from the porthole beside the\r\nengineer, cried:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's a fish! It's a big fish!\"\r\n\r\nAnd indeed it was, a flapping fish, of large size, the silver scales of\r\nwhich shone brightly in the sun.\r\n\r\n\"Pull!\" cried the captain to Mr. Bobbsey, and a few seconds later the\r\nfish lay flapping on deck.\r\n\r\nUp from below came Freddie, greatly excited, followed by his mother,\r\nNan, Flossie and Mr. Chase, Flossie chanting loudly: \"Freddie caught a\r\nfish! Freddie caught a fish!\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't I tell you I caught a fish?\" cried the little boy, his blue eyes\r\nshining with excitement.\r\n\r\n\"You certainly did,\" his father answered. \"But how did you do it, little\r\nfat fireman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Captain Crane gave me the fishline,\" Freddie answered.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I did,\" the captain said. \"He begged me for one and I let him take\r\nit. I didn't think he could do any harm, as I didn't let him take any\r\nsharp hooks--or any hooks, in fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he didn't have his line baited, or a hook on it, I don't see how he\r\ncaught anything,\" said the engineer.\r\n\r\n\"I did have something on my line,\" Freddie exclaimed. \"I had--I had----\"\r\n\r\nBut just then Flossie, who had been forgotten in the excitement, burst\r\nout with:\r\n\r\n\"Where's my doll, Freddie Bobbsey? Where's my nice rubber doll that you\r\ntook? I want her! Where is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I guess the fish swallowed her,\" Freddie answered.\r\n\r\n\"The fish!\" cried all the others.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. You see I tied the rubber doll on the end of the line 'stid of a\r\nhook,\" the little boy added. \"I knew I had to have something for to bait\r\nthe fish, so they'd bite, so I tied Flossie's doll on. The fish couldn't\r\nhurt it much,\" he went on. \"'Cause once Snap had your rubber doll in his\r\nmouth, Flossie, and she wasn't hurt a bit.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is my doll in the fish now?\" the little girl demanded, not quite\r\nsure whether or not she ought to cry.\r\n\r\n\"I guess it swallowed the doll,\" returned Freddie. \"Anyhow the doll was\r\non the end of the string, and now the string is in the fish's mouth. But\r\nmaybe you can get your doll back, Flossie, when the fish is cooked.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Crane bent over the fish, which was flopping about on deck.\r\n\r\n\"It has swallowed the end of the line, and, I suppose, whatever was fast\r\non the cord,\" he said. \"If it was Flossie's doll, that is now inside the\r\nfish.\"\r\n\r\n\"And can you get it out?\" asked Bert.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, when we cut the fish open to clean it ready to cook, we can\r\nget the doll.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that fish good to eat?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"Very good indeed. It's one of our best kind,\" the captain said.\r\n\"Freddie is a better fisherman than he knew.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the little Bobbsey twin had really caught a fish. Just why it was\r\nthe fish had bit on the line baited with Flossie's rubber doll, no one\r\nknew. But Captain Crane said that sometimes the fish get so hungry they\r\nwill almost bite on a bare hook, and are caught that way.\r\n\r\nThis fish of Freddie's was so large that it had swallowed the doll,\r\nwhich was tied fast on the end of the line, and once the doll was in its\r\nstomach the fish could not get loose from the heavy cord.\r\n\r\n\"But you mustn't take Flossie's doll for fish-bait again,\" said Mrs.\r\nBobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"No'm, I won't!\" Freddie promised. \"But now maybe I can have a real hook\r\nand bait.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we'll see about that,\" said Mr. Bobbsey with a smile.\r\n\r\nThe line was cut, close to the mouth of the big fish, which weighed\r\nabout fifteen pounds, and then Freddie's prize was taken by the cook\r\ndown to the galley, or kitchen. A little later the cook brought back\r\nFlossie's rubber doll, cleanly washed, and with the piece of string\r\nstill tied around its waist.\r\n\r\n\"Is she hurt?\" asked Flossie, for her doll was very real to the little\r\ngirl, since she often pretended she was alive.\r\n\r\n\"No, she's all right--not even a pinhole in her,\" said Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\"There are a few marks of the teeth of the fish, where it grabbed your\r\nrubber doll, but she was swallowed whole, like Jonah and the whale, so\r\nno harm was done.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad,\" said the little girl, as she cuddled her plaything, so\r\nstrangely given back to her. \"And don't you dare take her for fish-bait\r\nagain, Freddie Bobbsey.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Flossie, I won't,\" he said. \"I'll use real bait after this.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you mustn't do any more fishing without telling me or your mother,\"\r\ncautioned Mr. Bobbsey. \"You might have been pulled overboard by this\r\none.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, I couldn't,\" Freddie declared. \"Only my head could go through\r\nthe porthole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't do it again,\" his father warned him, and the little boy\r\npromised that he would not.\r\n\r\nThe fish was cooked for supper, and very good it was, too. Flossie and\r\nFreddie ate some and Flossie pretended to feed her doll a little, though\r\nof course the doll didn't really chew.\r\n\r\n\"The fish tried to eat you, and now you can eat some of the fish,\"\r\nFlossie said, with a laugh.\r\n\r\nThe Bobbsey twins wanted to stay up late that night, and watch the\r\nmoonlight on the water, but their mother, after letting them sit on deck\r\na little while, said it would be best for them to \"turn in,\" as the\r\nsailors call going to bed. They had been up early, and the first day of\r\ntheir new voyage at sea had been a long one.\r\n\r\nSo down to their berths they went and were soon ready for bed.\r\n\r\n\"My, we had a lot of things happen to-day!\" remarked Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm sorry I took the doll, but I'm awful glad I caught that great\r\nbig fish,\" answered Freddy.\r\n\r\n\"But you're never going to take her for fish bait again, Freddie\r\nBobbsey!\" repeated his twin.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't say I was. I guess the next time I want to go fishing I'll get\r\na regular piece of meat from the cook.\"\r\n\r\n\"Children, children! It's time to go to sleep now,\" broke in their\r\nmother. \"Remember, you'll want to be up bright and early to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I don't wake up, you call me, please,\" cried Freddie; and then he\r\nturned over and in a few minutes was sound asleep, and soon the others\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nThe next day passed. The children had fun on board the motor boat, and\r\nthe older folks read and talked, among other things, of how glad they\r\nwould be to rescue Jack from the lonely island. The following day it\r\nrained hard, and the four twins had to stay in the cabin most of the\r\ntime. But they found plenty to amuse them.\r\n\r\nThe third morning, as they came up on deck, the sun was shining, and one\r\nof the men was looking at something through a telescope.\r\n\r\n\"Does he see another fish, or maybe a whale or a shark?\" asked Freddie.\r\n\r\nThe sailor answered for himself, though he was really speaking to\r\nCaptain Crane, who was at the steering wheel.\r\n\r\n\"Land ho!\" cried the sailor.\r\n\r\n\"Where away?\" asked the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Dead ahead!\" went on the sailor.\r\n\r\nThat is the way they talk on board a ship and it means:\r\n\r\n\"I see some land.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Straight ahead.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bobbsey twins looked, but all they could see was a faint speck, far\r\nout in the deep, blue sea.\r\n\r\n\"Is that land?\" asked Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it's an island,\" answered Captain Crane.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, maybe it's the island where Jack is!\" Bert cried.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said Captain Crane. \"We'll soon know, for it is not many\r\nmiles away, though it looks far off on account of the fog and mist.\r\nWe'll soon be there.\"\r\n\r\nHe was just going to ring the bell, giving a signal to the engineer to\r\nmake the boat go faster when, all at once, Mr. Chase, who had helped\r\nFreddie catch the fish, came hurrying up out of the motor room.\r\n\r\n\"Captain!\" he cried. \"We'll have to slow down! One of the motors is\r\nbroken! We'll have to stop!\"\r\n\r\nThis was bad news to the Bobbsey twins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nUNDER THE PALMS\r\n\r\n\r\nCousin Jasper, who had been talking to Mr. Bobbsey, walked along the\r\ndeck with the children's father until he stood near Captain Crane, who\r\nwas now looking through the telescope, across the deep, blue sea, at the\r\nspeck which, it was said, was an island.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Mr. Dent. \"Why are we stopping, Captain\r\nCrane?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because one of our motors is broken, Mr. Dent. But don't let that worry\r\nyou. We have two, or, rather, a double motor, and if we can't go with\r\none we can with the other. It's like a little boy or girl, when they\r\nbreak one of their roller skates,\" he went on, looking at Flossie and\r\nFreddie.\r\n\r\n\"If they can't skate on two skates they can push themselves around on\r\none skate,\" said the captain. \"And that's what we'll have to do. But,\r\nMr. Chase, you think you can mend the broken engine easily enough, don't\r\nyou?\" he asked the man who had helped Freddie hold on to the big fish.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" answered the engineer. \"We can easily fix the broken motor.\r\nBut it will take a day or so, and we ought to be in some quiet place\r\nwhere the waves won't rock us so hard if a storm comes up. So why not go\r\nto this island that we see over there?\" and he pointed to the speck in\r\nthe ocean. \"Maybe there is a little bay there where the _Swallow_ can\r\nrest while my men and I fix the engine.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a good idea,\" said Captain Crane. \"Can you run to the island?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, if we go slowly.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" cried Cousin Jasper. \"Is there an island around here?\"\r\n\r\n\"The sailor who was looking through his telescope just saw one,\"\r\nreturned Captain Crane. \"I was going to tell you about it when Mr. Chase\r\nspoke to me about the broken engine. There is the island; you can see it\r\nquite plainly with the glass,\" and he handed the spy-glass to Cousin\r\nJasper.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe it's the island where that boy is,\" said Flossie to her father.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe,\" agreed Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"I hardly think it is,\" said Mr. Dent, as he put the telescope to his\r\neye. \"The island where we were wrecked is farther away than this, and\r\nthis one is smaller and has more trees on it than the one where poor\r\nJack and I landed. I do not think this is the place we want, but we can\r\ngo there to fix the engine, and then travel on farther.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can we really land on the island?\" asked Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you may go ashore there,\" the captain said. \"We shall probably\r\nhave to stay there two or three days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what fun we can have, playing on the island!\" cried Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"We'll pretend we're Robinson Crusoe,\" said her little brother. \"Come\r\non, Flossie, let's go and tell Nan and Bert!\"\r\n\r\nAnd while the two younger Bobbsey twins ran to tell their older brother\r\nand sister, Mr. and Mrs. Bobbsey, Cousin Jasper and Captain Crane took\r\nturns looking through the glass at the island, which was about five\r\nmiles away.\r\n\r\n\"It is not the island where I was,\" said Cousin Jasper again. \"But it\r\nlooks like a good place to stay while the engines of the _Swallow_ are\r\nbeing mended. So we'll go there, Captain!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" Captain Crane answered. \"We'll have to go a little slow,\r\nbut we'll be there in plenty of time.\"\r\n\r\nOnce more the motor boat started off, not going as fast as at first, but\r\nthe Bobbsey twins did not mind this a bit, as they were thinking what\r\nfun they would have on the island so far out at sea, and they stood at\r\nthe rail watching it as it appeared to grow larger the nearer the boat\r\ncame to it.\r\n\r\n\"We're coming up pretty fast, aren't we?\" remarked Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"Not as fast as we might come,\" answered Bert. \"However, we've got lots\r\nof time, just as Captain Crane said.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it a really and truly Robinson Crusoe place?\" questioned Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"I guess we'll find out about that a little later,\" answered her sister.\r\n\r\n\"I can see the trees now!\" exclaimed Freddie presently.\r\n\r\n\"So can I,\" answered his twin.\r\n\r\nAt last the anchor was dropped in a little bay, which would be sheltered\r\nfrom storms, and then the small boat was lowered so that those who\r\nwished might go ashore.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what lovely palm trees!\" exclaimed Nan, as she saw the beautiful\r\nbranches near the edge of the island, waving in the gentle breeze.\r\n\r\n\"They are wonderful,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey. \"The whole island is covered\r\nwith them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do palm leaf fans grow on these trees, Mother?\" asked Freddie as they\r\nwere being rowed ashore by one of the sailors.\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes, I suppose they could make palm leaf fans from some of the\r\nbranches of these palm trees,\" Mrs. Bobbsey said. \"And shall we call\r\nthis Palm Island? That is, unless it has some other name?\" she asked\r\nCaptain Crane.\r\n\r\n\"No, I hardly think it has,\" he answered. \"I was never here before,\r\nthough I have been on many of the little islands in this part of the\r\nsea. So we can call this Palm Island, if you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be a lovely place to stay,\" stated Nan. \"I just love to sit\r\nunder a tree, and look at the waves and the white sand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going in swimming!\" declared Bert. \"It's awful hot, and a good swim\r\nwill cool me off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't go in until we take a look and see if there are any sharks or big\r\nfish around,\" his father warned him. \"Remember we are down South, where\r\nthe water of the ocean is warm, and sharks like warm water. This is not\r\nlike it was at Uncle William's at Ocean Cliff. So, remember, children,\r\ndon't go in the water unless your mother, or some of the grown people,\r\nare with you.\"\r\n\r\nThe children promised they would not, and a little later the rowboat\r\ngrated on the sandy shore and they all got out on the beach of Palm\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\n\"Then this isn't the place where you were wrecked with Jack?\" asked Mr.\r\nBobbsey of Cousin Jasper.\r\n\r\n\"No; it isn't the same place at all. It is a beautiful island, though;\r\nmuch nicer than the one where I was.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if any one lives on it,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"I think not,\" answered Captain Crane. \"Most of these islands are too\r\nsmall for people to live on for any length of time, though fishermen\r\nmight camp out on them for a week or so. However, this will be a good\r\nplace for us to stay while the engines are being fixed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can we sleep here at night?\" asked Bert, who wanted very much to do as\r\nhe had read of Robinson Crusoe doing.\r\n\r\n\"Well, no, I hardly think you could sleep here at night,\" said Captain\r\nCrane. \"We may not be here more than two days, and it wouldn't be wise\r\nto get out the camping things for such a little while. Then, too, a\r\nstorm might come up, and we would have to move the boat. You can spend\r\nthe days on Palm Island and sleep on the _Swallow_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that will be fun!\" said Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Lots of fun,\" agreed Bert. \"And please, Daddy, can't we go in\r\nswimming?\"\r\n\r\nIt was a hot day, and as Captain Crane said there would be no danger\r\nfrom sharks if the children kept near shore, their bathing garments were\r\nbrought from the boat, and soon Bert and Nan, and Flossie and Freddie,\r\nwere splashing about in the warm sun-lit waters on the beach of Palm\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Bobbsey were sitting in the shade watching them, while the\r\nmen on the boat were working at the broken engine, when suddenly\r\nFlossie, who had come out of the water to sit on the sand, set up a cry.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's got hold of me!\" she shouted. \"Come quick, Daddy! Mother! It's\r\ngot hold of my dress and it's pulling!\"\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Bobbsey jumped up and ran down the beach toward the little\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOSSIE WAS TRYING TO PULL AWAY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nA QUEER NEST\r\n\r\n\r\nNan and Bert, who, with Freddie, were splashing out in the water a\r\nlittle way from where Flossie sat on the beach, heard the cries of the\r\nlittle girl and hurried to her. But Mr. and Mrs. Bobbsey were the first\r\nto reach Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Flossie's mother.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he's pulling me! He's pulling me!\" answered the little girl.\r\n\r\nAnd, surely enough, something behind her, which Mr. and Mrs. Bobbsey\r\ncould not see, did appear to have hold of the little short skirt of the\r\nbathing suit Flossie wore.\r\n\r\n\"Can it be a little dog playing with her?\" asked Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"We'd hear him bark if it was,\" his wife answered. \"And I don't believe\r\nthere are any dogs on this island.\"\r\n\r\nFlossie was trying to pull away from whatever had hold of her, and the\r\nlittle girl was having a hard time of it. Her bare feet dug in the white\r\nsand, and she leaned forward, just as she would have done if a dog had\r\nhad hold of her short skirt from behind.\r\n\r\nMr. Bobbsey, running fast, caught Flossie in his arms, and when he saw\r\nwhat was behind her he gave a loud shout.\r\n\r\n\"It's a turtle!\" he cried. \"A great, big turtle, and it took a bite out\r\nof your dress, Flossie girl!\"\r\n\r\n\"Will it bite me?\" asked the little \"fairy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not now!\" the twins' father answered with a laugh. \"There, I'll get you\r\nloose from him!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bobbsey gave a hard pull on Flossie's bathing suit skirt. There was\r\na sound of tearing cloth and then Mr. Bobbsey could lift his little girl\r\nhigh in his arms. As he did so Mrs. Bobbsey, who hurried up just then,\r\nsaw on the beach behind Flossie a great, big turtle, and in its mouth,\r\nwhich looked something like that of a parrot, was a piece of the bathing\r\nskirt. Mr. Bobbsey had torn it loose.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if he had bitten you instead of your dress!\" cried Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\"Flossie, are you hurt?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, she isn't hurt a bit,\" her father said. \"But of course it is a good\r\nthing that the turtle did not bite her. How did it happen, Flossie?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I was resting here, after I tried to swim,\" answered the little\r\ngirl, for she was learning to swim; \"and, all of a sudden, I wanted to\r\nget up, for Freddie called me to come and see how he could float. But I\r\ncouldn't get up. This mud turkle had hold of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't a mud turtle,\" said Mr. Bobbsey. \"But it certainly had hold of\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nJust then Cousin Jasper came along and saw the turtle crawling back\r\ntoward the water.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! I'll stop that and we'll have some turtle soup for dinner\r\nto-morrow!\" he cried. \"Not so fast, Mr. Turtle!\"\r\n\r\nWith that Cousin Jasper turned the turtle over on its back, and there\r\nthe big creature lay, moving its flippers, which it had instead of legs.\r\nThey were broad and flat.\r\n\r\n\"Won't it bite you?\" asked Freddie, who, with Nan and Bert, had waded\r\nashore.\r\n\r\n\"Not if I don't put my hand too near its mouth,\" Cousin Jasper answered.\r\n\"If I did that it would take hold of me, as it took hold of Flossie's\r\ndress. But I'm not going to let it. Did the turtle scare you, little fat\r\nfairy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I guess it did,\" she answered. \"Anyhow I hollered.\"\r\n\r\n\"You certainly did,\" her father said with a laugh. \"At least, you\r\nhallooed.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do with it?\" asked Bert, as he watched the big\r\nturtle, which still had hold of the piece torn from Flossie's bathing\r\nskirt.\r\n\r\n\"We'll eat him--that is part of him, made into soup,\" answered Cousin\r\nJasper.\r\n\r\n\"Can't he get away?\" Nan inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Not when he's on his back,\" said Mr. Dent. \"That's how the people down\r\nhere catch turtles. They go out on the beach, and when any of the\r\ncrawling creatures are seen, they are turned over as soon as possible.\r\nThere they stay until they can be picked up and put into a boat to be\r\ntaken to the mainland and sold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can they bite hard?\" asked Bert.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty hard, yes. See what a hold it has of Flossie's dress. I had to\r\ntear it to get it loose,\" returned Mr. Bobbsey. And the turtle still\r\nheld in his mouth, which was like the beak of a parrot, a piece of the\r\ncloth.\r\n\r\n\"He looks funny,\" put in Nan. \"But I feel sorry for him.\"\r\n\r\nBert and Freddie laughed at Nan for this.\r\n\r\n\"The turtle must have been crawling along the beach, to go back into the\r\nocean for a swim,\" said Cousin Jasper, \"and it ran right into Flossie as\r\nshe sat on the sand. Then, not knowing just what sort of danger was\r\nnear, the turtle bit on the first thing it saw, which was Flossie's\r\ndress.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it held on awful tight,\" said the little girl. \"It was just like,\r\nsometimes, when our dog Snap takes hold of a stick and pulls it away\r\nfrom you. At first I thought it was Snap.\"\r\n\r\n\"Snap couldn't swim away down here from Lakeport!\" said Freddie, with\r\nsome scorn.\r\n\r\n\"I know he couldn't!\" said his little sister. \"But only at first I\r\nthought it was Snap. Are there any more turkles here, Cousin Jasper?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes, a great many, I suppose. They come up out of the sea now and\r\nthen to lie on the sand in the sun. But I don't believe any more of them\r\nwill take hold of you. Just look around before you sit down, and you'll\r\nbe all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"My, he's a big one!\" cried Bert, as he looked at the wiggling creature\r\nturned on its back.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that isn't half the size of some,\" said Cousin Jasper. \"They often\r\nget to weigh many hundreds of pounds. But this one is large enough to\r\nmake plenty of soup for us. I'll tell Captain Crane to send the men over\r\nto get it.\"\r\n\r\nA little later the turtle was taken on board the _Swallow_ in the boat,\r\nand the cook got it ready for soup.\r\n\r\n\"And I think he'll make very good soup, indeed,\" said the cook.\r\n\r\n\"He certainly ought to make good soup,\" answered Captain Crane. \"It will\r\nbe nice and fresh, if nothing else.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Chase and his men were mending the broken engine, and the cook\r\nwas making turtle soup, the Bobbsey twins, with their father and mother\r\nand Cousin Jasper, stayed on Palm Island. They walked along the shore,\r\nunder the shady trees, and watched the blue waves break up on the white\r\nsand. Overhead, birds wheeled and flew about, sometimes dashing down\r\ninto the water with a splash to catch a fish or get something else to\r\neat.\r\n\r\n\"It's getting near dinner time,\" said Mr. Bobbsey, after a while. \"I\r\nguess you children had better get ready to go back to the boat for a\r\nmeal. You must be hungry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" answered Nan. \"It always makes me hungry to go in swimming.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm hungry anyhow, even if I don't go in swimming,\" Bert said.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we could have a little lunch here, on Palm Island, without\r\ngoing back to the _Swallow_,\" Mrs. Bobbsey suggested.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that would be fun!\" cried Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Daddy and I'll go to the ship in the boat and get the things to eat,\"\r\nproposed Bert. \"Then we'll bring 'em here and have a picnic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we might do that,\" Mr. Bobbsey agreed. \"It will save work for the\r\ncook, who must be busy with that turtle. We'll go and get the things for\r\nan island picnic.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is almost like the time we were on Blueberry Island,\" said Nan,\r\nwhen her father and brother had rowed back to the _Swallow_.\r\n\r\n\"Only there isn't any cave,\" Freddie said.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe there is,\" returned Nan. \"We haven't looked around yet. Maybe we\r\nmight find a cave here; mightn't we, Mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, you might. But don't go looking for one. I don't want you to\r\nget lost here. We must all stay together.\"\r\n\r\nIn a little while Bert and Mr. Bobbsey came back with baskets filled\r\nwith good things to eat. They were spread out on a cloth on the clean\r\nsand, not far from where the waves broke on the beach, and then, under\r\nthe waving palms, the picnic was held, Captain Crane and Cousin Jasper\r\nhaving a share in it. On the _Swallow_ the men still worked to mend the\r\nbroken engine.\r\n\r\n\"How long shall we be here?\" Mr. Bobbsey asked.\r\n\r\n\"About two days more,\" answered Captain Crane. \"It will take longer than\r\nwe at first thought to fix the break.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry about that!\" exclaimed Cousin Jasper. \"I wanted to get to\r\nthe other island as soon as we could, and save Jack. It must be very\r\nlonesome for him there, and perhaps he is hurt, or has become ill. I\r\nwish we could get to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll go there as soon as we can,\" promised Captain Crane. \"I am as\r\nanxious to get that poor boy as you are, Mr. Dent. At the same time I\r\nhope he has, before this, been taken off the island by some other boat\r\nthat may have seen him waving to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so, too,\" said Mr. Dent. \"Still I would feel better if we were\r\nat the other island and had Jack safe with us.\"\r\n\r\nThey all felt sorry for the poor boy, and wondered what he was doing\r\njust then.\r\n\r\n\"I hope he has something as good to eat as we have.\" Nan spoke with a\r\nsigh of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, this is a very nice meal, for a picnic,\" said her mother. \"We\r\nought to be very thankful to Cousin Jasper for taking us on such a nice\r\nvoyage.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you like it,\" returned Mr. Dent. \"All the while I was in the\r\nhospital, as soon as I was able to think, my thoughts were with this\r\npoor boy.\r\n\r\n\"I tried to get the hospital people to send a boat to rescue Jack; but\r\nthey said he could not be on the island, or the sailors who brought me\r\noff would have seen him. Then they thought I was out of my head with\r\nillness, and paid little attention to me.\r\n\r\n\"Then I thought of you, Dick, and I wrote to you. I knew you liked\r\ntraveling about, and especially when it was to help some one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I do,\" said the father of the Bobbsey twins. \"And if all goes\r\nwell we'll soon rescue Jack!\"\r\n\r\nAfter the picnic lunch the Bobbseys and their friends sat in the shade\r\nof the palms and talked over what had so far happened on the voyage.\r\nFlossie and Freddie wandered down the beach, and the little girl was\r\nshowing her brother where she sat when the turtle grabbed her dress.\r\n\r\n\"Let's dig a hole in the sand,\" Freddie said, a little later.\r\n\r\n\"We haven't any shovels,\" Flossie answered.\r\n\r\n\"We can take shells,\" said Freddie.\r\n\r\nSoon the two little twins were having fun in the sand of the beach. They\r\nhad not been digging very long when Freddie gave a shout.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I hope nothing more has happened!\" exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey, starting\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Freddie?\" called Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"Look at the funny nest we found!\" answered the little boy. \"It's a\r\nfunny nest in the sand, and it's got a lot of chicken's eggs in it! Come\r\nand look!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE \"SWALLOW\" IS GONE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What is the child saying?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey of her husband, for she\r\ndid not hear all that Freddie said.\r\n\r\n\"He's calling about having found a hen's nest,\" Mr. Bobbsey answered,\r\n\"but he must be mistaken. There can't be any chickens on this island.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe there are,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey. \"Perhaps, after all, some one\r\nlives here, on the other side where we haven't been. And they may keep\r\nchickens.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" answered her husband.\r\n\r\n\"I hardly think so,\" said Cousin Jasper. \"But we'll go to look at what\r\nFreddie has found.\"\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Bobbsey, with Cousin Jasper, followed by Bert and Nan,\r\nhurried down the beach to Flossie and Freddie, standing beside a hole\r\nthey had dug in the sand. The children were looking down into it.\r\n\r\n\"I busted one egg with my clam-shell shovel,\" Freddie was saying, \"but\r\nthere's a lot left.\"\r\n\r\n\"They were all covered with sand,\" added Flossie. \"And we dug 'em up!\r\nDidn't we, Freddie? We dug up the chickie's nest!\"\r\n\r\n\"But we didn't see any chickens,\" said the little boy.\r\n\r\n\"And for a very good reason,\" stated Cousin Jasper with a laugh, as he\r\nlooked down into the little sand pit. \"Those are the eggs of a turtle.\r\nPerhaps the very turtle that had hold of your dress, Flossie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do turtles lay eggs?\" asked Freddie in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed they do,\" said Cousin Jasper.\r\n\r\n\"O-o-oh!\" gasped Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"And the turtle's eggs are good to eat, too. They are not quite as nice\r\nas the eggs of a hen, but lots of people, especially those who live on\r\nsome of these islands, like them very much,\" went on Mr. Dent.\r\n\r\n\"Does a turkle lay its eggs in a nest like a hen?\" Flossie questioned.\r\n\"What made them all be covered up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" answered Cousin Jasper, as they all looked at the eggs in the\r\nsand, \"a turtle lays eggs like a hen, but she cannot hover over them,\r\nand hatch them, as a hen can, because a turtle has no warm feathers. You\r\nknow it takes warmth and heat to make an egg hatch. And, as a turtle\r\nisn't warm enough to do that, she lays her eggs in the warm sand, and\r\ncovers them up. The heat of the sun, and the warm sand soon hatch the\r\nlittle turtles out of the eggs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would turtles come out of these eggs?\" asked Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Really, truly?\" added Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"Just as surely as little chickens come out of hen's eggs,\" answered\r\nCousin Jasper. \"But they must be kept warm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we'd better cover 'em up again!\" exclaimed Freddie. \"We found the\r\nturtle's eggs when we were digging in the sand--Flossie and me. And I\r\ndidn't know they were there and I busted one of the eggs. First I\r\nthought they were white stones, but when I busted one, and the white and\r\nyellow came out, I found they were eggs.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the shells aren't hard,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey, as she leaned over the\r\nhole and touched the queer eggs in the sand-nest. \"The shells are like\r\nthe shell of a soft egg a hen sometimes lays.\"\r\n\r\n\"Except that the shells, or rather, skins, of these eggs are thicker\r\nthan those of a chicken,\" explained Cousin Jasper. \"These egg-skins are\r\nlike a piece of leather. If they were hard, like the eggs of a hen,\r\nperhaps the little turtles could not break their way out, as a turtle,\r\nthough it can give a hard bite, has no pointed beak to pick a hole in\r\nthe shell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you have made quite a discovery,\" said Mr. Bobbsey to the little\r\ntwins. \"Better cover the eggs up now, so the little turtles in them will\r\nnot get cold and die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there turtles in them now?\" asked Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"No, these eggs must be newly laid,\" Cousin Jasper said. \"But if they\r\nare kept warm long enough the little turtles will come to life in them\r\nand break their way out. Would you like some to eat?\" he asked Mr.\r\nBobbsey.\r\n\r\nThe father of the twins shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe I care for any,\" he answered. \"I'm not very fond of\r\neggs, anyhow, and I'll wait until we can find some that feathered\r\nchickens lay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll take a few for myself, and I know Captain Crane likes them,\"\r\nsaid Cousin Jasper. \"The rest we will leave to be hatched by the warm\r\nsun.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dent took some of the eggs out in his hat, and then Flossie and\r\nFreddie covered the rest with sand again.\r\n\r\n\"We'll dig in another place, so we won't burst any more turtle's eggs,\"\r\nsaid the little boy, as he walked down the beach with Flossie, each one\r\ncarrying a clam shell.\r\n\r\nIt was so nice on Palm Island that Mrs. Bobbsey said they would have\r\nsupper there, before going back on board the _Swallow_ to spend the\r\nnight. So more things to eat were brought off in the small boat, and, as\r\nthe sun was sinking down in the west, turning the blue waves of the sea\r\nto a golden color, the travelers sat on the beach and ate.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe we could build a little campfire here and stay for a while after\r\ndark,\" suggested Bert, who felt that he was getting to be quite a large\r\nboy now.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no indeed! We won't stay here after dark!\" cried Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\"Snakes and turtles and all sorts of things might crawl up out of the\r\nocean and walk all around us on the beach. As soon as it gets dark we'll\r\ngo back to the ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think that would be best,\" said Mr. Bobbsey. \"When we get to the\r\nother island, where we hope to find Jack, it will be time enough to camp\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we stay there long?\" Bert wanted to know.\r\n\r\n\"It all depends on how we find that poor boy,\" answered Cousin Jasper.\r\n\"If he is all right, and doesn't mind staying a little longer, we can\r\nmake a camp on the island. There are some tents on board and we can live\r\nin them while on shore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that'll be almost as much fun as Blueberry Island!\" cried Nan.\r\n\r\n\"It'll be nicer!\" Bert said. \"Blueberry Island was right near shore, but\r\nthis island is away out in the middle of the ocean, isn't it, Cousin\r\nJasper?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, not exactly in the middle of the ocean,\" was the answer. \"But I\r\nthink, perhaps, there is more water around it than was around your\r\nBlueberry Island.\"\r\n\r\nAfter supper, which, like their lunch, was eaten on the beach under the\r\npalm trees, the Bobbsey twins and the others went back to the _Swallow_.\r\nThe men working for the engineer, Mr. Chase, had not yet gotten the\r\nengine fixed, and it would take perhaps two more days, they said, as the\r\nbreak was worse than they had at first thought.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we'll have to stay here, that's all,\" said Cousin Jasper. \"I did\r\nhope we would hurry to the rescue of Jack, but it seems we can't. Anyhow\r\nit would not do to go on with a broken engine. We might run into a storm\r\nat sea and then we would be wrecked. So we will wait until everything is\r\nall right before we go sailing over the sea again.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems like being back home,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey, as she sat down\r\nlater in a deck chair.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you like it on the island?\" asked Bert.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. But after it got dark some big turtle might have come up out of\r\nthe sea and pulled on you, as one did on Flossie,\" and Bert's mother\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\n\"Well, no mud turkles can get on our ship, can they?\" asked the little\r\n\"fat fairy.\"\r\n\r\n\"No turtles can get on board here, unless they climb up the anchor\r\ncable,\" said Captain Crane with a laugh. \"Now we'll get all snug for the\r\nnight, so if it comes on to blow, or storm, we shall be all right.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a little too early to go to bed, so the Bobbsey twins and the\r\ngrown folks sat on deck in the moonlight. The men of the crew, and the\r\ncook, sat on the other end of the deck, and also talked. It was very\r\nwarm, for the travelers were now in southern waters, nearer the equator\r\nthan they had ever been before. Even with very thin clothes on the air\r\nfelt hot, though, of course, just as at Lakeport or Meadow Brook, it was\r\ncooler in the evening than during the day.\r\n\r\n\"It's almost too hot to go down into the staterooms,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\"I wonder if we couldn't sleep out on deck?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we could have the mattresses brought up,\" said Cousin Jasper. \"I\r\nhave often slept on the deck of my own boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some of the crew are going to, they tell me,\" Captain Crane said.\r\n\r\n\"Then we will,\" Mr. Bobbsey decided. \"It will be more like camping out.\r\nAnd it certainly is very hot, even with the sun down.\"\r\n\r\n\"We may have a thunderstorm in the night,\" the captain said, \"but we can\r\nsleep out until then.\"\r\n\r\nSo the mattresses and bed covers were brought up from the stateroom.\r\n\r\n\"This is a new kind of camping out, isn't it?\" remarked Flossie, as she\r\nviewed the bringing up of the bed things with great interest.\r\n\r\n\"It's a good deal like moving, I think,\" answered Freddie. \"Only, of\r\ncourse, we haven't got any moving van to load the things on to.\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you do with a moving van out here on a boat?\" demanded Bert.\r\n\r\n\"I could put it on another boat--one of those flat ones, like they have\r\ndown at New York, where the horses and wagons walk right on,\" insisted\r\nFreddie, thinking of a ferryboat.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we haven't any such boats around here, so we'd better not have\r\nany moving vans either,\" remarked Mr. Bobbsey, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to move anywhere, anyway,\" said Flossie. \"I'm too tired to\r\ndo it. I'm going to stay right where I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, so'm I going to stay!\" cried Freddie quickly. \"Come on--let us make\r\nour beds right over here,\" and he caught up one of the smaller\r\nmattresses. He struggled to cross the deck with it, but got his feet\r\ntangled up in one end, and pitched headlong.\r\n\r\n\"Look out there, Freddie Bobbsey, or you'll go overboard!\" cried his\r\nbrother, as he rushed to the little boy's assistance.\r\n\r\n\"If I went overboard, could I float on the mattress?\" questioned\r\nFreddie, as he scrambled to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so,\" answered his father. \"And, anyway, I wouldn't try\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nPresently the mattresses and bedcovers were distributed to everyone's\r\nsatisfaction, and then all lay down to rest.\r\n\r\nFor a time, Flossie and Freddie, as well as Nan and Bert, tossed about,\r\nbut at last they fell asleep. It was very quiet on the sea, the only\r\nnoise being the lapping of the waves against the sides of the _Swallow_.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bobbsey was just falling into a doze when there was a sudden splash\r\nin the water, and a loud cry.\r\n\r\n\"Man overboard! Man overboard!\" some one yelled.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if it should be one of the children!\" cried Mrs. Bobbsey. For, no\r\nmatter whether it is a boy, girl or woman that falls off a ship at sea,\r\na sailor will always call: \"'Man' overboard!\" I suppose that is easier\r\nand quicker to say.\r\n\r\n\"Who is it? What's the matter?\" cried Mr. Bobbsey, awakened suddenly\r\nfrom his sleep.\r\n\r\nThere was more splashing in the water alongside the boat, and then\r\nCaptain Crane turned on a lamp that made the deck and the water about\r\nvery light.\r\n\r\n\"Jim Black fell overboard,\" answered Mr. Chase, the engineer. \"He got up\r\nto draw a bucket of water to soak his head in so he could cool off, and\r\nhe reached over too far.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he all right?\" asked Captain Crane.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'm all right,\" was the answer of the sailor himself. \"I feel\r\ncooler now.\"\r\n\r\nAt this the older people laughed.\r\n\r\nHe had fallen in with the clothes on, in which he had been sleeping, but\r\nas soon as he struck the water he swam up, made his way to the side of\r\nthe ship, grabbed a rope that was hanging over the side, and pulled\r\nhimself to the deck.\r\n\r\n\"My! what a fright I had!\" exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey. \"I thought one of the\r\nchildren had rolled into the ocean!\"\r\n\r\n\"That couldn't happen,\" said Captain Crane. \"There is a strong railing\r\nall about the deck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's cooler now,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey. \"I think I'll take the twins\r\nand go to our regular beds.\"\r\n\r\nShe did this and was glad of it, for a little later a thunderstorm\r\nbroke, and it began to rain, driving every one below. The rest of the\r\nnight the storm kept up, and though the thunder was loud and the\r\nlightning very bright, the rain did one good service--it made the next\r\nday cooler.\r\n\r\n\"Well, shall we go ashore again?\" asked Mr. Bobbsey, when breakfast had\r\nbeen eaten aboard the _Swallow_.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes!\" cried the twins. \"We want to go swimming again!\"\r\n\r\n\"And I'm going to watch out for 'mud turkles,'\" said Flossie, as she\r\ncalled them.\r\n\r\nOnce more they went to the beach of Palm Island, and they had dinner on\r\nthe shady shore. In the afternoon, leaving the engineer and his helpers\r\non board to work away at the motor, the whole party of travelers,\r\nCaptain Crane, Cousin Jasper and all, started on a walk to the other\r\nside of the island. This took them out of sight of the boat.\r\n\r\nThey found many pretty things at which to look--flowers, a spring of\r\nsweet water where they got a drink, little caves and dells, and a place\r\nwhere hundreds of birds made their nests on a rocky cliff. The birds\r\nwheeled and soared about, making loud noises as they saw the Bobbsey\r\ntwins and the others near their nests.\r\n\r\nIt was along in the afternoon when they went back to the beach where\r\nthey had eaten, and where they were to have supper. Bert, who had run on\r\nahead around a curve in the woodland path, came to a stop on the beach.\r\n\r\n\"Why--why!\" he cried. \"She's gone! The _Swallow_ is gone!\" and he\r\npointed to the little bay.\r\n\r\nThe motor boat was no longer at anchor there!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nAWAY AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What's that you say?\" asked Captain Crane. \"The _Swallow_ gone?\"\r\n\r\n\"She isn't there,\" Bert answered. \"But maybe that isn't the bay where\r\nshe was anchored. Maybe we're in the wrong place.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, this is the place all right,\" said Cousin Jasper. \"But our boat\r\n_is_ gone!\"\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt of it. The little bay that had held the fine, big\r\nmotor boat was indeed empty. The small boat was drawn up on the sand,\r\nbut that was all.\r\n\r\n\"Where can it have gone?\" asked Mr. Bobbsey. \"Did you know the men we\r\nleft on it were going away, Captain Crane?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed, I did not! I can't believe that Mr. Chase and the others\r\nhave gone, and yet the boat isn't here.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Crane was worried. So were Mr. and Mrs. Bobbsey and Cousin\r\nJasper. Even Flossie and Freddie, young as they were, could tell that.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe a big mud turkle came and pulled the ship away,\" said Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"Or a whale,\" added Freddie. Any big fish or swimming animal, the little\r\ntwins thought, might do such a thing as that.\r\n\r\n\"No, nothing like that happened,\" said Captain Crane. \"And yet the\r\n_Swallow_ is gone. The men could not have thought a storm was coming up,\r\nand gone out to sea to be safe. There is no sign of a storm, and they\r\nnever would have gone away, unless something happened, without blowing a\r\nwhistle to tell us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe,\" said Bert, \"they got word from Jack, on the other island, to\r\ncome and get him right away, and they couldn't wait for us.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Crane shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"That couldn't happen,\" he said, \"unless another boat brought word from\r\npoor Jack. And if there had been another boat we'd have seen her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless both boats went away together,\" suggested Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"No, I think nothing like that happened,\" said the captain.\r\n\r\n\"But what can we do?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey. \"Shall we have to stay on this\r\nisland until the _Swallow_ comes back?\"\r\n\r\n\"She may not be gone very long,\" Mr. Bobbsey said.\r\n\r\n\"We can camp out here until she does come back,\" observed Nan. \"We have\r\nlots left to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\"There won't be much after supper,\" Bert said. \"But we can catch some\r\nturtles, or find some more eggs, and get fish, and live that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll catch a fish,\" promised Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand this,\" said Captain Crane, with another shake of his\r\nhead. \"I must go out and have a look around.\"\r\n\r\n\"How are you going?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"In the small boat. I'll row out into the bay for a little way,\" said\r\nthe seaman. \"It may be that the _Swallow_ is around some point of the\r\nisland, just out of sight. I'll have a look before we get ready to camp\r\nhere all night.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll come with you,\" offered Cousin Jasper.\r\n\r\n\"All right, and we'll leave Mr. Bobbsey here with his family,\" the\r\ncaptain said. \"Don't be afraid,\" he added to the children and Mrs.\r\nBobbsey. \"Even if the worst has happened, and the _Swallow_, by some\r\nmistake, has gone away without us, we can stay here for a while. And\r\nmany ships pass this island, so we shall be taken off pretty soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can be like Robinson Crusoe, really,\" Bert said.\r\n\r\n\"That isn't as much fun as it seems when you're reading the book,\" put\r\nin his mother. \"But we will make the best of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it'd be fun,\" murmured Freddie.\r\n\r\nCaptain Crane and Cousin Jasper got in the small boat and rowed out into\r\nthe bay. Anxiously the others watched them, hoping they would soon come\r\nback with word that the _Swallow_ had been blown just around \"the\r\ncorner,\" as Nan said, meaning around a sort of rocky point of the\r\nisland, beyond which they could not look.\r\n\r\n\"I do hope we shall not have to camp out here all night,\" said Mrs.\r\nBobbsey, with a little shiver, as she looked around.\r\n\r\n\"Are you afraid of the mud turkles?\" asked Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"No, dear. But I don't want to sleep on the beach without a bed or any\r\ncovers for you children.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we shall not have to,\" said Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\nThey waited a while longer, watching the small boat in which were\r\nCaptain Crane and Cousin Jasper, until it was rowed out of sight. Bert\r\ndid not seem to mind much the prospect of having to stay all night on\r\nPalm Island.\r\n\r\nNan, however, like her mother and her father, was a bit worried. But\r\nFlossie and Freddie were having a good time digging in the sand with\r\nclam shells for shovels. The little twins did not worry about much of\r\nanything at any time, unless it was getting something to eat or having a\r\ngood time.\r\n\r\n\"I know what I'm going to build!\" cried Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" demanded his twin quickly.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to build a great big sand castle.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't do it, Freddie Bobbsey. The sand won't stick together into a\r\ncastle.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to use wet sand,\" asserted Freddie. \"That will stick\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"You look out, Freddie Bobbsey, or you'll fall in!\" cried his sister,\r\nwhen Freddie had gone further down near the water where the sand was\r\nwet.\r\n\r\n\"Freddie! Freddie! keep away from that water!\" cried Mrs. Bobbsey. \"I\r\ndon't want you to get all wet and dirty.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I want to build a sand castle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you come up here where the sand is dry and build it,\" continued\r\nMrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"All right. In a minute,\" answered Freddie.\r\n\r\nMr. Bobbsey was straining his eyes, looking out toward the point of\r\nrock, around which the rowboat had gone, and his wife was standing\r\nbeside him, gazing in the same direction, when Bert, who looked the\r\nother way, cried:\r\n\r\n\"There she comes now! There's the _Swallow_!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, surely enough, there she came back, as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nMr. Bobbsey waved his hat and some one on the motor boat blew a whistle.\r\nAnd then, as if knowing that something was wrong, the boat was steered\r\ncloser to shore than it had come before, and Mr. Chase cried:\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter? Did anything happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"We thought something had happened to you!\" shouted Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\"Captain Crane and Mr. Dent have gone off in the small boat to look for\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's too bad,\" said Mr. Chase. \"While you were away, on the other\r\nside of the island, we finished work on the engine. We wanted to try it,\r\nso we pulled up anchor and started off. We thought we would go around to\r\nthe side of the island where you were, but something went wrong, after\r\nwe were out a little while, and we had to anchor in another bay, out of\r\nsight. But as soon as we could we came back, and when I saw you waving\r\nyour hat I feared something might have happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, nothing happened. And we are all right,\" said Mr. Bobbsey, \"except\r\nthat we were afraid we'd have to stay on the island all night. And\r\nCaptain Crane has gone to look for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry about that,\" returned the engineer. \"It would have been all\r\nright, except that the motor didn't work as I wanted it to. But\r\neverything is fine now, and we can start for the other island as soon as\r\nwe like. I'll blow the whistle and Captain Crane will know that we are\r\nback at our old place.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral loud toots of the air whistle were given, and, a little later,\r\nfrom around the point came the small boat with the captain and Cousin\r\nJasper in it. They had rowed for some distance, but had not seen the\r\n_Swallow_, and they were beginning to get more worried, wondering what\r\nhad become of her.\r\n\r\n\"However, everything is all right now,\" said Captain Crane, when they\r\nwere all once more on board the motor boat, it having been decided to\r\nhave supper there instead of on Palm Island.\r\n\r\n\"Aren't we coming back here any more?\" asked Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"Not right away,\" his father told him. \"We stopped here only because we\r\nhad to. Now we are going on again and try to find Jack Nelson.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have been longer getting there than I hoped we'd be,\" said Cousin\r\nJasper, \"but it could not be helped. I guess Jack will be glad to see us\r\nwhen we do arrive.\"\r\n\r\nThe things they had taken to Palm Island, when they had their meals\r\nunder the trees, had been brought back on the _Swallow_. The motor boat\r\nwas now ready to set forth again, and soon it was chug-chugging out of\r\nthe quiet bay.\r\n\r\n\"And we won't stop again until we get to where Jack is,\" said Mr. Dent.\r\n\r\n\"Not unless we have to,\" said Captain Crane.\r\n\r\nThe _Swallow_ appeared to go a little faster, now that the engine was\r\nfixed. The boat slipped through the blue sea, and, as the sun sank down,\r\na golden ball of fire it seemed, the cook got the supper ready.\r\n\r\nThe Bobbseys had thought they might get to eat on the beach, but they\r\nwere just as glad to be moving along again.\r\n\r\n\"And I hope nothing more happens,\" said Mr. Bobbsey. \"Freddie, don't try\r\nto catch any more fish, or anything like that. There is no telling what\r\nmight come of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't,\" promised the little fellow. \"But if I had my fire engine here\r\nFlossie and I could have some fun.\"\r\n\r\nOn and on sailed the _Swallow_. Every one was safely in bed, except one\r\nman who was steering and another who looked after the motor, when Mrs.\r\nBobbsey, who was not a heavy sleeper, awakened her husband. It was about\r\nmidnight.\r\n\r\n\"Dick!\" she exclaimed in a loud whisper, \"I smell smoke! Do you?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bobbsey sniffed the air. Then he jumped out of his berth.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I smell smoke!\" he cried. \"And I see a blaze! Wake up, everybody!\"\r\nhe cried, \"The boat is on fire!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nORANGE ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps Freddie Bobbsey had been dreaming about a fire. At any rate he\r\nmust have been thinking about it, for, no sooner did Mr. Bobbsey call,\r\nafter his wife spoke to him, than Freddie, hardly awake, cried:\r\n\r\n\"Where's my fire engine? Where's my fire engine? I can put out the\r\nfire!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bobbsey hurried to the berths where the children were sleeping.\r\n\r\nThat is, they had been sleeping, but the call of their father, and the\r\nshouting of Freddie, awakened them. Flossie, Nan and Bert sat up,\r\nrubbing their eyes, though hardly understanding what it was all about.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" cried Bert.\r\n\r\n\"The boat is on fire!\" his mother answered. \"Slip on a few clothes, take\r\nyour life preserver, end get out on deck.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Bobbseys first came aboard the _Swallow_ they were shown how to\r\nput on a life preserver, which is a jacket of canvas filled with cork.\r\nCork is light, much lighter than wood, and it will not only float well\r\nin water, but, if a piece is large enough, as in life preservers, it\r\nwill keep a person who wears it, or who clings to it, up out of the sea\r\nso they will not drown.\r\n\r\n\"Get your life preservers!\" cried Mr. Bobbsey; then, when he saw that\r\nhis wife had one, and that the children were reaching under their berths\r\nfor theirs, he took his.\r\n\r\nThe smoke was getting thicker in the staterooms, and the yells and\r\nshouts of Captain Crane, Cousin Jasper and the crew could be heard.\r\n\r\nUp on deck rushed the Bobbseys. There they found the electric lights\r\nglowing, and they saw more smoke. Cousin Jasper and Captain Crane had a\r\nhose and were pointing it toward what seemed to be a hole in the back\r\npart of the boat.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, see!\" shouted Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"Is the fire engine working?\" Freddie demanded, as he saw them. \"Can I\r\nhelp put the fire out?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, little fireman!\" said Captain Crane with a laugh, and when Mrs.\r\nBobbsey heard this she felt better, for she thought that there was not\r\nmuch danger, or the captain would not have been so jolly. \"We have the\r\nfire almost out now,\" the captain went on. \"Don't be worried, and don't\r\nany of you jump overboard,\" he said as he saw Mrs. Bobbsey, with the\r\ntwins, standing rather close to the rail.\r\n\r\n\"No, we won't do that,\" she said. \"But I was getting ready to jump into\r\na boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess you won't have to do that,\" said Cousin Jasper.\r\n\r\n\"Is the _Swallow_ on fire?\" asked Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"It was,\" his cousin answered. \"But we have put it out now. There is a\r\ngood pump on board, and we pumped water on the blaze as soon as we saw\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the hold, which was a place where canned food and other things\r\ncould be stored, smoke was still pouring, and now and then little\r\ntongues of fire shot up. It was this fire which Mr. Bobbsey had seen\r\nthrough the open door of his stateroom.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, maybe it's going to be an awful big fire!\" said Freddie. \"Maybe\r\nit'll burn the whole boat up!\"\r\n\r\n\"Freddie, Freddie! Don't say such dreadful things!\" broke in his mother.\r\n\"We don't want this boat to burn up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see where it is,\" said Flossie. \"It's down in that great big\r\ncellar-like place where they keep all those things to eat--those boxes\r\nof corn and beans and salmon and sardines and tomatoes, and all the\r\nthings like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. And the 'densed milk!\" put in Freddie. \"And 'spargus. And the jam!\r\nAnd all those nice sweet things, too!\" he added mournfully.\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do if all our food is burnt up?\" went on Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"We can't live on the boat if we haven't anything to eat,\" asserted\r\nFreddie. \"We'll have to go on shore and get something.\"\r\n\r\n\"You might catch another big fish,\" suggested his twin.\r\n\r\n\"Would you let me have your doll?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I wouldn't!\" was the prompt response. \"You can get lots of other\r\nthings for bait, and you know it, Freddie Bobbsey!\"\r\n\r\n\"How did the fire happen?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey of the captain, when she\r\ngot the chance.\r\n\r\n\"One of the electric light wires broke and set fire to some oily rags,\"\r\nanswered Captain Crane. \"Then some empty wooden boxes began to blaze.\r\nThere was nothing in them--all the food having been taken out--but the\r\nwood made quite a fire and a lot of smoke.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Chase, who was on deck steering, smelled the smoke and saw the\r\nlittle blaze down in a storeroom. He called me and I called Mr. Dent. We\r\nhoped we could get the fire out before you folks knew about it. But I\r\nguess we didn't,\" said the captain.\r\n\r\n\"I smelled smoke, and it woke me up,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey. \"Then I called\r\nmy husband and we all came on deck.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was the right thing to do,\" Captain Crane said. \"And it was also\r\ngood to put on the life preservers,\" for even Flossie and Freddie had\r\ndone this. \"Always get ready for the worst,\" the captain went on, \"and\r\nthen if you don't have to take to the small boats so much the better.\r\nBut the fire will soon be out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I see the fire engine?\" asked Freddie. \"I haven't seen a fire\r\nengine for a long while.\" At his home he was always interested in this,\r\nbut, luckily, Lakeport had few fires.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't exactly a fire engine,\" said Cousin Jasper to the little\r\nfellow. \"It's just a big pump that forms part of one of the motors. I\r\nguess you can see how it works, for the fire is so nearly out now that\r\nwe won't need much more water on it.\"\r\n\r\nSo the Bobbseys took off their life preservers, which are not very\r\ncomfortable things to wear, and stayed on deck, watching the flames die\r\nout and the smoke drift away. The _Swallow_ had been slowed down while\r\nthe captain and the others were fighting the fire.\r\n\r\n\"Everything is all right now,\" said Cousin Jasper, and he took Freddie\r\nto the motor room to show him the pump, while Captain Crane still played\r\nthe hose on the last dying embers.\r\n\r\nThe fire only burned up the oil-soaked rags and some empty boxes, not\r\ndoing any damage to the motor boat, except a little scorching. The smoke\r\nmade part of the _Swallow_ black, but this could be painted over.\r\n\r\n\"And very lucky for us it was no worse,\" said Mr. Bobbsey, when they\r\nwere ready to go back to their staterooms.\r\n\r\nFreddie stayed and watched the pump as long as they would let him. It\r\ncould be fastened to one of the motors and it pumped water from the\r\nocean itself on the blaze.\r\n\r\n\"It's better than having a regular fire engine on land,\" said Freddie,\r\ntelling Flossie about it afterward, \"'cause in the ocean you can take\r\nall the water you like and nobody minds it. When I grow up I'm going to\r\nbe a fireman on the ocean, and have lots of water.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll have to have a boat so you can go on the ocean,\" said the little\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I like a boat, too,\" went on Freddie. \"You can run the boat,\r\nFlossie, and I'll run the pump fire engine.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" agreed little Flossie. \"That's what we'll do.\"\r\n\r\nAfter making sure that the last spark was out, Captain Crane shut off\r\nthe water. The Bobbseys went back to bed, but neither the father nor the\r\nmother of the twins slept well the rest of the night. They were too busy\r\nthinking what might have happened if the fire had not been seen in time\r\nand plenty of water sprayed on it to put it out.\r\n\r\n\"Though there would not have been much danger,\" Captain Crane said at\r\nthe breakfast table, where they all gathered the next morning. \"We could\r\nall have gotten off in the two boats, and we could have rowed to some\r\nisland. The sea was smooth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where would we get anything to eat?\" asked Nan.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we'd put that in the boats before we left the ship,\" said the\r\ncaptain. \"And we'd take water, too. But still I'm glad we didn't have to\r\ndo that.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the Bobbseys were glad, too.\r\n\r\nPart of the day was spent in getting out of the storeroom the burned\r\npieces of boxes. These were thrown overboard. Then one of the crew\r\npainted over the scorched places, and, by night, except for the smell of\r\nsmoke and paint, one would hardly have known where the fire had been.\r\n\r\nThe weather was bright and sunny after leaving Palm Island, and the\r\ntwins sat about the deck and looked across the deep, blue sea for a\r\nsight of the other island, where, it was hoped, the boy Jack would be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what he's doing now,\" remarked Bert, as he and Nan were\r\ntalking about the lost one, while Flossie and Freddie were listening to\r\na story their mother was telling.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe he's walking up and down the beach looking for us to come,\"\r\nsuggested Nan.\r\n\r\n\"How could he look for us when he doesn't know we're coming?\" asked\r\nBert.\r\n\r\n\"Well, maybe he _hopes_ some boat will come for him,\" went on Nan. \"And\r\nhe must know that Cousin Jasper wouldn't go away and leave him all\r\nalone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I guess that's so,\" agreed Bert. \"It must be pretty lonesome, all\r\nby himself on an island.\"\r\n\r\n\"But maybe somebody else is with him, or maybe he's been taken away,\"\r\nwent on Nan. \"Anyhow we'll soon know.\"\r\n\r\n\"How shall we?\" asked Bert.\r\n\r\n\"'Cause Captain Crane said we'd be at the island to-morrow if we didn't\r\nhave a storm, or if nothing happened.\"\r\n\r\nOn and on went the _Swallow_. When dinner time came there was served\r\nsome of the turtle soup from the big crawler that had pulled on\r\nFlossie's dress. There was also fish, but Freddie did not catch any\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nCousin Jasper and Mr. Bobbsey fished off the side of the motor boat and\r\ncaught some large ones, which the cook cleaned and got ready for the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\"Going to sea is very nice,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey. \"You don't have to send\r\nto the store for anything to eat, and when you are hungry all you have\r\nto do is to drop your hook overboard and catch a fish.\"\r\n\r\nIt was about noon of the next day when Bert, who was standing in the\r\nbow, or front part of the vessel, said to his father:\r\n\r\n\"I see something like a black speck out there,\" and he pointed. \"Maybe\r\nit's another boat.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bobbsey looked and said:\r\n\r\n\"I think more likely that is an island. Perhaps it is the very one we\r\nare sailing for--the one where Cousin Jasper left Jack.\"\r\n\r\nHe called to Captain Crane, who brought a powerful telescope, and\r\nthrough that the men looked at the speck Bert had first seen.\r\n\r\n\"It's land all right,\" said Captain Crane. In about an hour they were so\r\nnear the island that its shape could easily be made out, even without a\r\nglass. Then Cousin Jasper said:\r\n\r\n\"That's it all right. Now to go ashore and find that poor boy!\"\r\n\r\nOn raced the _Swallow_, and soon she dropped anchor in a little bay like\r\nthe one at Palm Island. In a small boat the Bobbseys and others were\r\nrowed to the shore.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, look at the orange trees!\" cried Nan, as she saw some in a grove\r\nnear the beach.\r\n\r\n\"Are they real oranges, Captain?\" asked the younger girl twin.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. And it looks as though some one had an orange grove here at one\r\ntime, not so very long ago, though it hasn't been kept up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this Orange Island?\" asked Bert.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we can call it that,\" said Cousin Jasper. \"In fact it never had a\r\nname, as far as I know. We'll call it Orange Island now.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a good name for it, I think,\" remarked Nan.\r\n\r\n\"And now to see if we can find Jack!\" went on Nan's twin.\r\n\r\n\"Let's all holler!\" suddenly said Freddie. \"Let's all holler as loud as\r\nwe can!\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\" asked Cousin Jasper, smiling at the little boy. \"Why do you\r\nwant to halloo, Freddie?\"\r\n\r\n\"So maybe Jack can hear us, and he'll know we're here. Whenever me or\r\nFlossie gets lost we always holler; don't we?\" he asked his little\r\nsister.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"And when Bert or Nan, or our father or mother is looking for us, even\r\nif we don't know we're lost, they always holler; don't you, Bert?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and sometimes I have to 'holler' a lot before you answer,\" said\r\nNan's brother.\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps it would be a good thing to call now,\" agreed Mr.\r\nBobbsey. \"Shall we, Cousin Jasper?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he answered. So the men, with the children to help them, began to\r\nshout.\r\n\r\n\"Jack! Jack! Where are you, Jack?\"\r\n\r\nThe woods and the orange trees echoed the sound, but that was all.\r\n\r\nWas the missing boy still on the island?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nLOOKING FOR JACK\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain and again the Bobbseys and the others called the name of Jack, but\r\nthe children's voices sounding loud, clear and shrill above the others.\r\nBut, as at first, only the echoes answered.\r\n\r\n\"That's the way we always holler when we're lost,\" said Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"But I guess Jack doesn't hear us,\" added Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"No, I guess not,\" said Cousin Jasper, in rather a sad voice.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure this is the right island?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey, looking\r\nabout the place where they had landed from the _Swallow_.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, this is the island where I was shipwrecked,\" said Mr. Dent,\r\n\"though Jack and I did not land just here. It was on the other side, and\r\nwhen we go there I can show you the wreck of my motor boat--that is, if\r\nthe storms have not washed it all away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then maybe Jack is on the other side of the island,\" said Bert.\r\n\"And he couldn't hear us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that might be so,\" agreed Cousin Jasper. \"We'll go around there.\r\nBut as it will take us some little time, and as we want to get some\r\nthings ashore from the ship, we had better wait until later in the day,\r\nor, perhaps, until to-morrow, to look. Though I want to find Jack as\r\nsoon as I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe he'll find us before we find him,\" suggested Mr. Bobbsey. \"I\r\nshould think he would be on the lookout, every day, for a ship to which\r\nhe could signal to be taken off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he is,\" said Cousin Jasper. \"Well, I hope he comes walking\r\nalong and finds us. He'll be very glad to be taken away from this place,\r\nI guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet it is lovely here,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey. \"I never thought we\r\nwould find oranges growing in such a place.\"\r\n\r\n\"I forgot to speak about them,\" said Cousin Jasper. \"In fact I was so\r\nill and so miserable after the wreck, that I did not take much notice of\r\nwhat was on the island. But there are many orange trees. It must have,\r\nat some time, been quite a grove.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking maybe we'd find cocoanuts,\" said Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"But oranges are just as nice,\" put in his little sister.\r\n\r\n\"Nicer,\" Freddie declared. \"I like oranges. May we eat some, Mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes, I guess so,\" answered Mrs. Bobbsey slowly. \"Will it be all\r\nright, Cousin Jasper?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, the oranges are for whomsoever wants them. Help yourselves,\r\nchildren, while we get the things on shore that we need from the motor\r\nboat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, goody!\" shouted Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"Are we going to sleep here at night?\" asked Bert.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I did think we might camp out here for a week or so, after we got\r\nhere and found that Jack was all right,\" answered Cousin Jasper. \"But if\r\nhe is ill, and needs a doctor, we shall have to go right back to\r\nFlorida. However, until we are sure of that, we will get ready to camp\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what fun!\" cried Nan.\r\n\r\n\"It'll be as nice as on Blueberry Island!\" Flossie exclaimed, clapping\r\nher fat little hands.\r\n\r\n\"But there weren't any oranges on Blueberry Island,\" added Freddie.\r\n\"Still the blueberries made nice pies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother made the pies,\" said Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"Well, the blueberries helped her,\" Freddie said, with a laugh.\r\n\r\nThe Bobbsey twins gathered oranges from the trees and ate them. The men\r\nfolks then began to bring things from the _Swallow_, which was anchored\r\nin a little bay, not far from shore.\r\n\r\nTwo tents were to be set up, and though the crew would stay on the boat\r\nwith Captain Crane, to take care of the vessel if a sudden storm came\r\nup, the Bobbseys and Cousin Jasper would camp out on Orange Island.\r\n\r\nIn a little while one tent was put up, an oil-stove brought from the\r\nboat so that cooking could be done without the uncertain waiting for a\r\ncampfire, and boxes and baskets of food were set out.\r\n\r\n\"I want to put up the other tent,\" said Freddie. \"I know just how it\r\nought to be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Freddie, you can help,\" was the answer from Bert. \"Only, you\r\nhad better not try to pound any of the pegs in the ground with the\r\nhatchet, or you may pound your fingers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho! I guess I'm just as good a carpenter as you are, Bert Bobbsey!\"\r\nsaid the little boy stoutly.\r\n\r\nHe took hold of one of the poles and raised it up, but then it slipped\r\nfrom his grasp and one end hit Nan on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Freddie! do be careful!\" she cried.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't mean to hit you, Nan,\" he said contritely. \"It didn't hurt,\r\ndid it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not very much. But I don't want to get hit again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Freddie, you had better let the older folks set up that tent,\" said\r\nMrs. Bobbsey. \"Here, you and Flossie can help put these boxes and\r\nbaskets away. There is plenty of other work for you to do.\"\r\n\r\nA little later the second tent was in position, and everything about the\r\ncamp was put in good shape.\r\n\r\nThen Cousin Jasper, Mr. Bobbsey and the captain, taking Bert with them,\r\nstarted around for the other side of the island to look and call for the\r\nmissing Jack.\r\n\r\n\"I want to come, too,\" said Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"Not now,\" his mother told him. \"It is too far for a little boy. Perhaps\r\nyou and Flossie may go to-morrow. You stay and help me make the camp\r\nready for night.\"\r\n\r\nThis pleased Freddie and Flossie, and soon they were helping their\r\nmother, one of the sailors doing the heavy lifting.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Bert, his father and the others walked on through the woods,\r\naround to the other side of the island. They found the place where\r\nCousin Jasper's boat had struck the rocks and been wrecked, and Mr. Dent\r\nalso showed them the place where he and Jack stayed while they were\r\nwaiting for a boat to come for them.\r\n\r\n\"And here is where we set up our signal,\" cried Mr. Bobbsey's cousin, as\r\nhe found a pole which had fallen over, having been broken off close to\r\nthe ground. On top was still a piece of canvas that had fluttered as a\r\nflag.\r\n\r\n\"But why didn't Jack leave it flying, to call a boat to come and get him\r\nwhen he found you gone?\" asked Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Cousin Jasper. \"This is very strange. I thought\r\nsurely we would find Jack as soon as we reached the island. It may be\r\nthat he has been taken off by some fishermen, but I think I would have\r\nheard of it. And he was here about a week ago, for Captain Harrison saw\r\nhim, you remember he told us. Well, we must look further.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yell and yell some more,\" added Bert. \"Maybe he can hear us now.\"\r\n\r\nSo they shouted and called, but no one answered them, and Cousin Jasper\r\nshook his head.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what can have happened to the poor boy!\" he said.\r\n\r\nThey walked along the beach, and up among the palm and orange trees,\r\nlooking for the missing boy. But they saw no signs of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nFOUND AT LAST\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Bert, with his father, Cousin Jasper and Captain Crane, got back to\r\nthe place where Mrs. Bobbsey had been left with Nan and the two smaller\r\ntwins, the camp on Orange Island was nearly finished. The tents had been\r\nput up, and the oil-stove was ready for cooking.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you find that poor boy?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"No, we saw no trace of him,\" her husband answered.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, isn't that too bad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am very sorry,\" sighed Cousin Jasper. \"But I have not yet given\r\nup. I'll stay here until either I find him, or make sure what has\r\nhappened to him. Poor Jack has no relatives, and I am his nearest\r\nfriend. I feel almost as though he were my son. We will find him if he\r\nis on this island.\"\r\n\r\nBert and the others who had walked around to the other side of the\r\nisland, hoping that Jack might be found, were tired from their trip, and\r\nwhen they got back were glad to sit on the beach in the shade. A meal\r\nwas soon ready, and when they had eaten they all felt better.\r\n\r\n\"It is too late to do much more searching to-day,\" said Cousin Jasper,\r\n\"but we will start early in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this they did, after a quiet night spent on the island. As soon,\r\nalmost, as the sun had risen, the Bobbsey twins were up, and Bert and\r\nNan gathered oranges for breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"I wish we could live here always,\" said Freddie. \"I'd never have to go\r\nto the store for any fruit.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if we stayed here we couldn't have Snap or Snoop or Dinah or Sam,\r\nor anybody like that from Lakeport,\" put in Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't we, Mother?\" asked the little boy.\r\n\r\n\"Course we couldn't!\" insisted Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess it would be hard to bring from Lakeport all the friends\r\nand all the things you like there,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then we'll go back home after we find Jack,\" decided Freddie.\r\n\r\nBreakfast over, the search for the missing boy was begun once more, Mrs.\r\nBobbsey and the smaller twins going along.\r\n\r\nIn some places, however, the way was rough and steep, and once on top of\r\na little hill, Freddie suddenly cried:\r\n\r\n\"Look out! I'm coming!\"\r\n\r\nAnd come he did, but in a queer way. For he slipped and fell, and rolled\r\nto the bottom, bringing up with a bump against a stump.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my dear little fat fireman! Did you hurt yourself?\" asked his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nFreddie did not answer at first. He slowly got to his feet, looked up\r\nthe hill down which he had rolled, and then at the stump, which was\r\ncovered with moss.\r\n\r\n\"I--I guess I'm all right,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"He's so fat he didn't get hurt,\" said Cousin Jasper. \"Fat boys and\r\ngirls are just the kind to bring to a place like this. They can't get\r\nhurt easily.\"\r\n\r\nFreddie laughed, and so did the others, and then they went on again.\r\nThey looked in different places for the missing boy, and called his name\r\nmany times.\r\n\r\nBut all the sounds they heard in answer were those of the waves dashing\r\non the beach or the cries of the sea-birds.\r\n\r\n\"It is very strange,\" said Captain Crane. \"If that boy was here about a\r\nweek ago, you'd think we could find some trace of him--some place where\r\nhe had built a fire, or set up a signal so it would be seen by passing\r\nships. I believe, Mr. Dent, that he must have been taken away, and when\r\nwe get back to St. Augustine he'll be there waiting for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps you are right,\" said Cousin Jasper, \"but we will make\r\nsure. We'll stay here a week, anyhow, and search every part of Orange\r\nIsland.\"\r\n\r\nThey had brought their lunch with them, so they would not have to go\r\nback to the camp when noon came, and, finding a pleasant place on the\r\nbeach, near a little spring of water, they sat down to rest.\r\n\r\nFlossie and Freddie, as often happened, finished long before the others\r\ndid, and soon they strolled off, hand in hand, down the sands.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going, children?\" called Mrs. Bobbsey to them.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, just for a walk,\" Freddie answered.\r\n\r\n\"An' maybe we'll see Jack,\" added Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"I only wish they would, but it is too much to hope for,\" said Cousin\r\nJasper, and he looked worried.\r\n\r\nBert, Nan and the others stayed for some little time after lunch,\r\nsitting in the shade on the beach, and talking. They were just about to\r\nget up and once more start the search; when Flossie and Freddie came\r\nrunning back. One look at their faces told their mother that something\r\nhad happened.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, children?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"We--we found a big, black cave!\" answered Freddie, somewhat out of\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n\"An'--an' they's a--a _giant_ in it!\" added Flossie, who was also\r\nbreathing hard.\r\n\r\n\"A cave!\" cried Mr. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by a giant in it?\" asked Cousin Jasper.\r\n\r\n\"Well, when you see a big black hole in the side of a hill, isn't that a\r\ncave?\" asked Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"It surely is,\" said his father.\r\n\r\n\"An' when you hear somebody making a big noise like 'Boo-oo-oo-oo! Boo!'\r\nmaybe that's a giant, like it is in the story,\" said Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I guess perhaps you heard the wind moaning in a cave,\" said Captain\r\nCrane.\r\n\r\n\"No, there wasn't any wind blowing,\" Freddie said. And, surely enough,\r\nthere was not. The day was clear and calm.\r\n\r\n\"We heard the booing noise,\" Freddie said.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure it wasn't a mooing noise, such as the cows make?\" asked\r\nNan.\r\n\r\n\"There aren't any cows on Orange Island; are there, Cousin Jasper?\"\r\nasked Bert.\r\n\r\n\"I think not. Tell me, children, just what you heard, and where it was,\"\r\nhe said to Flossie and Freddie.\r\n\r\nThen the little twins told of walking along the hill that led up from\r\nthe beach and of seeing a big hole--a regular cave. They went in a\r\nlittle way and then they heard the strange, moaning sound.\r\n\r\nCousin Jasper seemed greatly excited.\r\n\r\n\"I believe there may be something there,\" he said. \"We must go and look.\r\nIf they heard a noise in the cave, it may be that it was caused by some\r\nanimal, or it may be that it was----\"\r\n\r\n\"Jack!\" exclaimed Bert. \"Maybe it's Jack!\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe,\" said Cousin Jasper. \"We'll go to look!\"\r\n\r\nCousin Jasper and Mr. Bobbsey walked on ahead, with Flossie and Freddie\r\nto show where they had seen the big, black hole. It was not far away,\r\nbut so hidden by bushes that it could have been seen only by accident,\r\nunless some one knew where it was.\r\n\r\nOutside the entrance they all stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Listen!\" said Flossie.\r\n\r\nIt was quiet for a moment, and then came a sound that surely was a\r\ngroan, as if some one was in pain.\r\n\r\n\"Who's in there?\" cried Cousin Jasper.\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" was the faint answer. \"Oh, will you please come in and help me.\r\nI fell and hurt my leg and I can't walk, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you Jack Nelson?\" cried Cousin Jasper.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's my name. A friend and I were wrecked on this island, but I\r\ncan't find him and----\"\r\n\r\n\"But he's found you!\" cried Mr. Dent. \"Oh, Jack! I've found you! I've\r\nfound you! I've come back to get you! Now you'll be all right!\"\r\n\r\nInto the cave rushed Cousin Jasper, followed by the others. Mr. Bobbsey\r\nand Captain Crane had pocket electric flashlights, and by these they\r\ncould see some one lying on a pile of moss in one corner of the cavern.\r\n\r\nIt was a boy, and one look at him showed that he was ill. His face was\r\nflushed, as if from fever, and a piece of sail-cloth was tied around one\r\nleg. Near him, on the ground where he was lying, were some oranges, and\r\na few pieces of very dry crackers, called \"pilot biscuits\" by the\r\nsailors.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jack, what has happened to you? Are you hurt, and have you been in\r\nthis cave all the while?\" asked Mr. Dent.\r\n\r\n\"No, not all the while, though I've been in here now for nearly a week,\r\nI guess, ever since I hurt my leg. I can crawl about a little but I\r\ncan't climb up and down the hill, so I got in here to stay out of the\r\nstorms, and I thought no one would ever come to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You poor boy!\" softly said Mrs. Bobbsey. \"Don't talk any more now. Wait\r\nuntil you feel better and then you can tell us all about it. Poor boy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you hungry?\" asked Freddie; for that, to him, seemed about the\r\nworst thing that could happen.\r\n\r\n\"No, not so very,\" answered Jack. \"When I found I couldn't get around\r\nany more, or not so well, on my sore leg, I crawled to the trees and got\r\nsome oranges. I had a box of the biscuit and some other things that\r\nwashed ashore from the wreck after you went away,\" he said to Cousin\r\nJasper.\r\n\r\n\"Well, tell us about it later,\" said Mr. Bobbsey. \"Now we are going to\r\ntake care of you.\"\r\n\r\nThey made a sort of little bed on poles, with pieces of the sail-cloth,\r\nand the men carried Jack to the camp. There Captain Crane, who knew\r\nsomething about doctoring, bound up his leg, and when the lost boy had\r\nbeen given some hot soup, and put in a comfortable bed, he felt much\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nA little later he told what had happened to him.\r\n\r\n\"After you became so sick,\" said Jack to Cousin Jasper, the others\r\nlistening to the story, \"I walked to the other end of the island to see\r\nif I could not see, from there, some ship I could signal to come and get\r\nus. I was so tired I must have fallen asleep when I sat down to rest,\r\nand when I woke up, and went back to where you had been, Mr. Dent, you\r\nweren't there. I didn't know what had happened to you and I couldn't\r\nfind you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Men came in a boat and took me away,\" said Cousin Jasper, \"though I\r\ndidn't know it at the time. When I found myself in the hospital I\r\nwondered where you were, but they all thought I was out of my head when\r\nI wanted them to come to the island and rescue you. So I had to send for\r\nMr. Bobbsey to come.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we found the cave, didn't we?\" cried Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, only for you and Flossie, just stumbling on it, as it were,\" said\r\nhis father, \"we might still be hunting for Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad we found you,\" said Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"So'm I,\" added Freddie.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad myself,\" Jack said, with a smile at the Bobbsey twins. \"I was\r\ngetting tired of staying on the island all alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you do all the while?\" asked Bert. \"Did you feel like Robinson\r\nCrusoe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well a little,\" Jack answered. \"But I didn't have as much as Robinson\r\nhad from the wreck of his ship. But I managed to get enough to eat, and\r\nI had the cave to stay in. I found that other one, and went into that,\r\nas it was better than where we first were,\" he said to Mr. Dent.\r\n\r\n\"I made smudges of smoke, and set up signals of cloth,\" the boy went on,\r\n\"but a storm blew one of my poles down, and I guess no one saw my\r\nsignals.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Captain Harrison did, but it was so stormy he couldn't get close\r\nenough to take you from the island,\" said Captain Crane.\r\n\r\n\"And then we came on as soon as we could,\" added Cousin Jasper. \"Oh,\r\nJack, I'm so glad we have found you, and that you are all right! You had\r\na hard time!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it was sort of hard,\" the boy admitted. \"But it's a good thing\r\noranges grow here. I got some clams, too, and I found a nest of turtle's\r\neggs, and roasted some of them. I didn't like them much, but they\r\nstopped me from being hungry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now we'll feed you on the best in camp,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey.\r\n\r\n\"And I caught a turkle, once!\" added Flossie.\r\n\r\n\"I guess you mean the turtle caught you,\" said Nan with a laugh.\r\n\r\nBut now Jack's troubles were over. As he was weak from not having had\r\ngood food, and from being ill, it was decided to keep him at the camp\r\nfor a short while. In that time the Bobbsey twins had a good time on\r\nOrange Island, and when he was able to walk about, even though he had to\r\nlimp on a stick for a crutch, Jack went about with the children, showing\r\nthem the different parts of the cave where he had stayed. He could not\r\nhave lived there much longer alone, for his food was almost gone when\r\nFlossie and Freddie heard him groaning in the cavern.\r\n\r\n\"And we thought you were a giant!\" said Flossie with a laugh.\r\n\r\nThey had found, by accident, what the others had been looking for so\r\ncarefully but could not find. And Jack had no idea his friends were on\r\nthe island until they walked into the cave with the flashing lights.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm glad we traveled on the deep, blue sea,\" said Nan, about a week\r\nafter Jack had been found. \"This is the nicest adventure we ever had!\"\r\n\r\nThese were happy days on Orange Island. Jack rapidly grew better, and\r\nwould soon be able to make the trip back to St. Augustine in the motor\r\nboat. But it was so lovely on that island in the deep, blue sea that the\r\nBobbseys stayed there nearly a month, and by that time they were all as\r\nbrown as berries, including Jack, who had been pale because of his\r\nillness.\r\n\r\nSo the lost and lonely boy was found, and he and Cousin Jasper were\r\nbetter friends than ever. And as for the Bobbsey twins, though they had\r\nhad many adventures on this voyage, still others were in store for them.\r\nBut now we will say \"Good-bye!\" for a time.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS BY LAURA LEE HOPE\r\n\r\nTHE BOBBSEY TWINS SERIES\r\n\r\n    THE BOBBSEY TWINS\r\n    THE BOBBSEY TWINS IN THE COUNTRY\r\n    THE BOBBSEY TWINS AT THE SEASHORE\r\n    THE BOBBSEY TWINS AT SCHOOL\r\n    THE BOBBSEY TWINS AT SNOW LODGE\r\n    THE BOBBSEY TWINS ON A HOUSEBOAT\r\n    THE BOBBSEY TWINS AT MEADOW BROOK\r\n    THE BOBBSEY TWINS AT HOME\r\n    THE BOBBSEY TWINS IN A GREAT CITY\r\n    THE BOBBSEY TWINS ON BLUEBERRY ISLAND\r\n    THE BOBBSEY TWINS ON THE DEEP BLUE SEA\r\n\r\nTHE BUNNY BROWN SERIES\r\n\r\n    BUNNY BROWN AND HIS SISTER SUE\r\n    BUNNY BROWN AND HIS SISTER SUE ON GRANDPA'S FARM\r\n    BUNNY BROWN AND HIS SISTER SUE PLAYING CIRCUS\r\n    BUNNY BROWN AND HIS SISTER SUE AT AUNT LU'S CITY HOME\r\n    BUNNY BROWN AND HIS SISTER SUE AT CAMP REST-A-WHILE\r\n    BUNNY BROWN AND HIS SISTER SUE IN THE BIG WOODS\r\n    BUNNY BROWN AND HIS SISTER SUE ON AN AUTO TOUR\r\n    BUNNY BROWN AND HIS SISTER SUE AND THEIR SHETLAND PONY\r\n\r\nTHE OUTDOOR GIRLS SERIES\r\n\r\n    THE OUTDOOR GIRLS OF DEEPDALE\r\n    THE OUTDOOR GIRLS AT RAINBOW LAKE\r\n    THE OUTDOOR GIRLS IN A MOTOR CAR\r\n    THE OUTDOOR GIRLS IN A WINTER CAMP\r\n    THE OUTDOOR GIRLS IN FLORIDA\r\n    THE OUTDOOR GIRLS AT OCEAN VIEW\r\n    THE OUTDOOR GIRLS ON PINE ISLAND\r\n    THE OUTDOOR GIRLS IN ARMY SERVICE\r\n\r\nGROSSET & DUNLAP, PUBLISHERS, NEW YORK",
