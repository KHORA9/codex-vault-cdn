The experience of wars points out the\r\nlesson that our service men, because of army life, with its openness\r\nand activity, will largely seek out-of-door vocations and occupations.\r\nThis fact is accepted by the allied European nations. That is why their\r\nprograms and policies of re-locating and readjustment emphasize the\r\nopportunities on the land for the returning soldier. The question then\r\nis, “What land can be made available for farm homes for our soldiers?”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have millions of acres of undeveloped lands that can be made\r\navailable for our home-coming soldiers. We have arid lands in the\r\nWest; cut-over lands in the Northwest, the Lake States and the South;\r\nand also swamp lands in the Middle West and South, which can be made\r\navailable through proper development. Much of this land can be made\r\nsuitable for farm homes if properly handled. But it will require that\r\neach type of land be dealt with in its own particular fashion. The\r\narid land will require water; the cut-over land will require clearing,\r\nand the swamp land must be drained. Without any of these aids, they\r\nremain largely “No Man’s Land.” The solution of these problems is no\r\nnew thing. In the admirable achievement of the Reclamation Service in\r\nreclamation and drainage, we have abundant proof of what can be done.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur thought should now be given to the problem. We should know by the\r\ntime the war ends, not merely how much arid land can be irrigated, nor\r\nhow much swamp land reclaimed, nor where the grazing land is and how\r\nmany cattle it will support, nor how much cut-over land can be cleared,\r\nbut we should know with definiteness where it is practicable to begin\r\nnew irrigation projects, what the character of the land is, what the\r\nnature of the improvements needed will be, and what the cost will be.\r\nWe should know also, not in a general way, but with particularity, what\r\ndefinite areas of swamp land can be reclaimed, how they can be drained,\r\nwhat the cost of drainage will be, what crops they will raise. We\r\nshould have in mind specific areas of grazing lands, with a knowledge\r\nof the cattle that are best adapted to them, and the practicability of\r\nsupporting a family upon them. So, too, with our cut-over lands. We\r\nshould know what it would cost to pull or “blow-out” stumps and to put\r\nthe lands into condition for farm homes. We should know what it will\r\ncost to buy these lands If they are in private hands. In short, at the\r\nconclusion of the war, the United States should be able to say to its\r\nreturned soldiers: “If you wish to go upon a farm, here are a variety\r\nof farms of which you may take your pick, which the Government has\r\nprepared against the time of your returning.”\r\n\r\n_From a letter to President Wilson from Secretary Lane of the\r\nDepartment of the Interior._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE MENTOR ASSOCIATION\r\n\r\nEstablished for the Development of Popular Interest in Art, Literature,\r\nScience, History, Nature and Travel\r\n\r\nTHE MENTOR IS PUBLISHED TWICE A MONTH\r\n\r\nBY THE MENTOR ASSOCIATION, INC., AT 114 EAST 18TH STREET, NEW YORK, N.\r\nY.

Genesis 1,17: “A river went out of Eden to\r\nwater the garden.” The practice of irrigation is probably coincident\r\nwith that of the earliest agriculture of record for the reason that\r\nthe latter was begun in regions of deficient rainfall in the Old\r\nWorld--Egypt, Assyria, Mesopotamia, Persia, India, Ceylon and China.\r\nEvidences abound of the existence of important storage and distribution\r\nsystems constructed previous to 2000 B. C. Even greater antiquity\r\nis ascribed to similar work, the remains of which are found in the\r\nvalley of the Euphrates, and also in China. The ancient aqueducts and\r\nsubterranean canals of South America, extending for thousands of miles,\r\nonce supplied great cities and irrigated immense areas. Irrigation on\r\nthe Continent of North America was old when Rome was in the glory of\r\nits youth. Centuries before the venturous Norseman landed upon the\r\nbleak and inhospitable shores of New England a large population dwelt\r\nin the hot valleys of the Southwest, in New Mexico and Arizona. From\r\nthe solid rock, with primitive tools of stone, they cut ditches and\r\nhewed the blocks for many chambered palaces, which they erected in the\r\ndesert or on the limestone ledge of deep river canyons. These voiceless\r\nruins, older than the memory of many centuries, tell the story of a\r\nthrifty home-loving and semi-cultured people, concerning whose fate\r\nhistory brings us no word. The long lines of their canals, now choked\r\nwith the wind-swept drift of centuries, give mute and pathetic evidence\r\nof the patience and engineering skill of the builders.\r\n\r\nEarly in the sixteenth century, when Coronada, the first great American\r\nexplorer, swept up the Rio Grande Valley in Texas and New Mexico, he\r\nfound a pastoral race dwelling in pueblos and practicing irrigation as\r\nhad their forefathers, perhaps as far back as in the days of Abraham.\r\n\r\nThe priests with the aid of their Indian converts extended the practice\r\nof irrigation wherever they established the missions, and introduced\r\nmany varieties of fruits and vegetables from Spain and Italy.\r\n\r\nIrrigation by English-speaking people began in America in 1700, and,\r\nfor fully a century, was confined to use in the cultivation of rice on\r\nnarrow strips along the coastal rivers of the Carolinas and Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe first Americans to reclaim extensive areas in the arid region were\r\nthe Mormons, who, in 1847, settled on the eastern borders of the Great\r\nInterior Basin, on the site of Salt Lake City. Under wise leadership\r\nand through community effort, numerous canal systems were constructed\r\nand extended to thousands of acres of desert lands.\r\n\r\nBetween 1862 and 1880 many canal systems were constructed in\r\nColorado, though none was important. The success of the Greeley\r\ncolony, established in 1870 in the northern part of the State, gave\r\nconsiderable impetus to irrigation all over the arid region.\r\n\r\nIn the last thirty years there has been an awakening to the opportunity\r\nthat lies in the arid West for the homemaker, and a remarkable\r\ntransformation has taken place in many parts of this region. Irrigation\r\ncanals long enough to girdle the globe three times now distribute\r\nthe normal flow and the stored water of Western streams to millions\r\nof acres, which support hundreds of thousands of contented farmers.\r\nCities, populous and great, have sprung up, rural communities,\r\nattractive and prosperous, broad vistas of fertile fields and\r\nblossoming orchards have replaced the wastes of sand and sage brush.\r\n\r\n  WRITTEN ESPECIALLY FOR THE MENTOR BY C.

This was\r\nespecially true in the Yakima and Okanogan valleys in Washington,\r\nthe St. Mary and Flathead in Montana, Uncompahgre and Grand River in\r\nColorado, and the Utah valley, Utah. These canals cling to the edges of\r\ndeep and precipitous canyons, or hug the steep mountain slopes. Here\r\nand there huge aqueducts of reinforced concrete span the chasms. For\r\nmiles the water is siphoned across broad ravines in iron-banded stave\r\npipe, or flows in tunnels through the cliffs.\r\n\r\nThe Tieton main canal of the Yakima project, Washington, for a distance\r\nof twelve miles is through a very rough country. It is cement lined\r\nthroughout, and for two miles is in tunnels. For the greater part of\r\nits length it hugs the side of the canyon, in places 500 feet above the\r\nriver. The lining for the canal was molded on the river bank, where\r\nwater, sand, and gravel were available for concrete making, and the\r\nforms were carried to the top of the canyon by tram and cableways.\r\nThe capacity of the canal is 300 cubic feet per second, and it is now\r\nirrigating 40,000 acres. The High line Canal of the Strawberry Valley\r\nproject swings around the steep slopes of the Spanish Peaks of the\r\nWasatch Range in Utah for several miles. At one point a portion of the\r\nwater is dropped in pipes to the turbines, where power is developed and\r\ndistributed to several towns in the valley. At various points along its\r\ncourse the canal is covered with a reinforced concrete roof to prevent\r\ninjury and filling up from avalanches in the spring.\r\n\r\n  WRITTEN ESPECIALLY FOR THE MENTOR BY C.

COLORADO]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_RECLAIMING THE DESERT_\r\n\r\n_The Gunnison Tunnel_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE\r\n\r\nNotable among the engineering works calling for courage and daring is\r\nthe Gunnison Tunnel. This great bore, which in a sense changes physical\r\ngeography, is excavated under the Vernal Mesa in western Colorado.\r\nThe river portal is in the famous Black Canyon of the Gunnison, a\r\nprecipitous chasm 3,000 feet deep, and the tunnel extends for nearly\r\nsix miles, 2,500 feet below the surface of the Mesa. The outlet is in\r\nthe valley of the Uncompahgre. By means of a low diversion dam, the\r\nwaters of the Gunnison are turned into the tunnel and transferred to\r\nthe desert valley of another stream. The early reconnaissance surveys\r\nand examinations and the final work of determining the location of\r\nthe tunnel were attended with unusual dangers. The exploration of the\r\ncanyon, which up to that time had never been traversed by man, and the\r\ncareful and detailed preparation of a topographic map of this rugged\r\nregion called for genuine heroism. In the former task the surveyors\r\nrisked their lives for many days in the depths of the gorge, and, in\r\nthe latter, the engineers performed their duties under conditions of\r\ngreat hazard and peril.\r\n\r\nThe construction forces met and overcame almost every difficulty ever\r\nencountered in tunnel excavation. Gas, cave-ins and subterranean\r\nsprings interposed obstacles throughout the work. At one time a heavy\r\nflow of carbon dioxide, or choke damp, forced the workmen to flee for\r\ntheir lives and delayed operations until a ventilating shaft 680 feet\r\ndeep was sunk. The heavy flows of hot and cold water necessitated the\r\nuse of large pumps for months at a time. For more than 500 feet the\r\ntunnel was driven through a remarkable bed of fossils, consisting of\r\nthe shells of extinct sea creatures, many of which were of great size.\r\nExposed to the air, disintegration was rapid, and the huge masses of\r\nfalling rock imperilled the lives of the workmen.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the extraordinary care of the Government to safeguard\r\nthe employees, a heavy toll of human lives was taken. The excavation\r\nwork was projected from four adits, three on the Uncompahgre side and\r\none in the canyon, and crews of drill men and assistants simultaneously\r\nbegan boring into the mountain from both sides. When the last charge of\r\ndynamite had been exploded and the tunnel was “holed” through, it was\r\nfound that the line was true within a fraction of an inch.\r\n\r\nConnecting with the outlet of the tunnel is a large cement-lined canal\r\nwhich conveys the water to the valley ten miles below. Here it mingles\r\nwith the Uncompahgre, and by means of a complex distribution system of\r\ncanals and laterals, finally reaches the irrigable lands.\r\n\r\nThe Uncompahgre Valley is one of exceptional scenic beauty, and is\r\nblessed with a fertile soil adapted to the growing of a wide variety of\r\nproducts. Its irrigable area is approximately 100,000 acres, more than\r\nhalf of which is now producing two generous harvests.\r\n\r\nThe discharge of the Uncompahgre River was quite inadequate for the\r\nirrigable lands in the valley, which had been brought under the ditches\r\nconstructed before the passage of the reclamation act, and failure of\r\ncrops occurred frequently during the low water periods. In addition\r\nthere were thousands of acres of desert land in the valley doomed to\r\naridity unless the water supply could be supplemented. The Gunnison\r\nRiver, flowing uselessly in its profound canyon on the other side of\r\nthe range, was drawn upon by means of the tunnel, and an abundance\r\nof water is now assured for all the lands included in this project.\r\nAgriculture here is exceedingly diversified, and in many sections, is\r\nintensive. The products of the soil range include alfalfa, cereals,\r\nsugar beets, potatoes, onions, peas, beans, and other vegetables,\r\npeaches, pears, and apples. Surrounding the valley are vast areas of\r\nfine grazing lands included in national forests, which furnish summer\r\npastures for thousands of cattle and sheep. The rapid settlement of the\r\nfarm lands has been followed by a corresponding growth of the towns of\r\nMontrose, Delta and Olathe.\r\n\r\n  WRITTEN ESPECIALLY FOR THE MENTOR BY C. J.

Brilliant\r\nand daring in its conception, diverse and complicated in its problems,\r\nand stupendous in its structural features, the Roosevelt Dam stands\r\ntoday an enduring monument to the creative genius of its designer\r\nand builder. The layman will not appreciate the complexity of the\r\nproblems and the variety of obstacles that were encountered without an\r\nunderstanding of the locality in which the work was carried on. The dam\r\nis located in a region which was once regarded as almost inaccessible\r\nexcept to the nomadic Apache, who found a safe refuge here for many\r\nyears. The nearest railway is 62 miles away. Twenty miles of this\r\ndistance is across a waterless, parched and forbidding desert. For more\r\nthan 40 miles the country, gashed and fissured into fantastic forms,\r\na region of stupendous canyons, steep sided mountains, and turbulent\r\nstreams, presented an almost insuperable barrier to ingress. It is\r\na region of colorful and inspiring scenery, but most unpromising as\r\na site for a large engineering work. The initial step was to build\r\na highway to the dam-site, a task of much difficulty on account of\r\nthe rough country and the unwillingness of white laborers to do the\r\nwork. The road was finally completed, largely by utilizing the Apache\r\nIndians, many of whom were remnants of Geronimo’s band of marauders.\r\nThe influence of this experiment in employing Indians has been of\r\nlasting benefit to the Red Men of the Southwest, many of whom have\r\ncontinued on similar work for railroads and other corporations. The\r\nRoosevelt Road, now familiarly known as the Apache trail, is one of the\r\nmost spectacular highways in the country, and thousands of tourists go\r\nover it each year in automobiles.\r\n\r\nThe site for the dam was located at the entrance of the profound canyon\r\nthat Salt River has cut through the mountains. Just above the canyon,\r\nSalt River and Tonto Creek converge in a broad, level valley, which is\r\nnow submerged to a depth of nearly 200 feet, forming one of the largest\r\nartificial lakes in the country.\r\n\r\nThe Roosevelt Dam is of sandstone hewn from the walls of the canyon\r\nin which it is built. It is of gravity section, arched up stream, 280\r\nfeet high, 168 feet thick at base, and 1,080 feet long on top. At its\r\nbase it covers an acre of ground. A building 209 feet square and 26\r\nstories high would about cover the space of the dam except that halfway\r\nup the sides there would be space for two more structures, each 11\r\nstories high and 885 feet long on top. Owing to the long haul for the\r\nrailroad the activities of the engineers were varied and numerous.\r\nThe Government cement mill turned out 600,000 barrels of first-class\r\ncement, the saw-mill in the National Forest manufactured all the\r\nlumber required to house 2,000 people, and for stores, offices, etc.;\r\na hydro-electric plant furnished power to the contractor on the dam\r\nand light for the camp; two farms were operated to supply food for the\r\nemployés; water works and sewerage systems were installed, and law and\r\norder were preserved during four years of construction. The engineer\r\nhad charge also of a large commissary, a big mess, and superintended a\r\nbrickyard and cement pipe plant.\r\n\r\nDuring the building of the dam the valley below was the scene of\r\nunprecedented activity. A million-dollar diversion dam was constructed\r\nacross the Salt River to divert the stored water into thousands of\r\nmiles of canals; power plants, pumping plants, transmission lines,\r\nand a thousand and one engineering details were completed in advance\r\nof the great day when the turbulent floods of Salt River would be\r\nconserved and led to the thirsty lands. On March 18, 1911, former\r\nPresident Roosevelt, in the presence of an assemblage of nearly 1,000\r\npeople, formally dedicated the structure which fittingly bears his\r\nname. By the simple pressure of an electric button the enormous gates\r\nweighing 60,000 pounds were raised and released the pent-up floods\r\nfor irrigating nearly 200,000 acres of Salt River Valley. The swift\r\npassing of years has been marked by marvelous progress in this desert\r\nvalley. In 1902, when the work was started, the assessed valuation of\r\nthe country, of which the valley is the larger part, was $5,000,000. In\r\n1916, the taxable property values were $72,000,000. In 1913, the first\r\ncrop census of the project was taken and showed an irrigated acreage of\r\n159,170, and a gross value of crops of $4,775,000. In 1917, the total\r\nacreage watered was 201,600; the gross value of crops was $13,692,000.\r\nDuring the same period the number of farms increased from 3,600 to\r\n4,326. The net cost of the entire project to June 30, 1917, including\r\n$3,500,000 for the Roosevelt Dam, was $11,367,000. The annual returns\r\nfrom the land irrigated by it are more than $3,000,000 in excess of\r\nthis amount. The gross value of crops in 1917 was almost equal to\r\nthat of New Hampshire and Rhode Island in the census year of 1909.\r\nIn October of 1917 the Roosevelt Dam, canal system, and power plants\r\nwere formally transferred to the Water Users’ Association, under whose\r\nmanagement the project henceforth will be operated.\r\n\r\n  WRITTEN ESPECIALLY FOR THE MENTOR BY C.

Completed on October 4, 1915, it ranks\r\nall other dams in the world in its height, 350 feet above bedrock.\r\nIt is of rubble concrete, arch gravity type, and contains 585,130\r\ncubic yards of material. It was built by Government forces, and not\r\nby contract, and its completion in two years less than the estimated\r\ntime and at a saving of more than two million dollars in the estimated\r\ncost, furnishes a striking example of Federal efficiency and economy.\r\nIn connection with this important work the engineers built and operated\r\na standard gauge railway 14 miles long, which carried more than 80,000\r\npassengers, and 14,000,000 tons of freight. A unique camp, containing\r\n4,000 people, was established, with sewerage, water works, and\r\nelectric lights. Schools for the children of employees, a hospital,\r\npostal savings bank, churches, and Y. M. C. A., a large general store\r\nand commissary, blacksmith and machine shops, sand-grinding and\r\ncement-mixing plants, all under the engineer’s direction, gave to the\r\ncamp the aspect of an enterprising and busy community. It was a camp\r\nin which, for four years, there was no night. Throughout the greater\r\npart of this period the work proceeded without interruption, night\r\nand day, with three eight-hour shifts. Profiting by the experience\r\ngained on other large works of the Service, and with labor-saving\r\ndevices of their own invention, the engineers on Arrowrock worked\r\nwith extraordinary swiftness and sureness, and established a most\r\nenviable record for economy and time. The total cost of the Arrowrock\r\nis approximately $5,000,000, and its principal purpose is to conserve\r\nthe floods of Boise River for the irrigation of 240,000 acres of land\r\nembraced in the Boise project.\r\n\r\n  WRITTEN ESPECIALLY FOR THE MENTOR BY C.

No life\r\nso sordid, prosaic, or wretched, but has felt sometime its light and\r\ngladsome touch. In the desert, romance finds its chief essentials in\r\nadventure, courage, daring and self-sacrifice. For more than half a\r\ncentury man has been writing a romance of compelling interest upon the\r\nface of the dusty earth. Irrigation, with Midas’ touch, has changed the\r\ndesert’s frown to smiling vistas of verdure. Its solemn silence has\r\nbeen broken by the voices of countless happy people.\r\n\r\nOur national strength is in its citizens, and the place in which\r\nthe best is bred is in the country. The threat of urban congestion,\r\nno longer remote, and the pressure of population, which even now is\r\nbearing heavily upon our resources, are unanswerable arguments for\r\nincreasing and making permanent the nation’s virility, prosperity and\r\ngrowth by creating more country homes.\r\n\r\nIt is an economic axiom that the stability of a nation is assured only\r\nwhen the bulk of its citizens reside in their own homes. The ideals and\r\nprinciples for which our forefathers fought cannot be preserved and\r\nmaintained by a citizenry whose interest does not extend beyond mere\r\nwage earning. The American desert was won by war, treaty, discovery and\r\npurchase. Flying at one time the flags of four nations, its history\r\nis rich in thrilling incident and adventure. Its milestones are the\r\nbones of trappers, explorers, and pioneers. Its people are strong and\r\ncourageous. To battle with the elemental forces of nature has become a\r\npassion. While the glamor of romance in years agone is dispelled, it is\r\nstill romance-land, but with a new background.

With the passage of that law and\r\nanother which initiated the construction of the Panama Canal,--both\r\nwere signed by President Roosevelt in the same month,--the engineering\r\nforces of the nation were flung into widely differing fields of\r\nactivity. With the Panama Canal engineers, the task, though herculean,\r\nwas confined to a restricted and perfectly well defined area. On\r\nthe other hand, the Reclamation problems were generally in regions\r\nwidely separated, remote from transportation, and often unsurveyed\r\nand unexplored. To appreciate the variety and magnitude of the tasks\r\ninvolved, it is necessary briefly to describe the general character of\r\nthe country in which these works were projected.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Desert States_\r\n\r\nThe great American desert may be roughly described as lying between\r\nthe western boundary of the Mississippi Valley and the Pacific Ocean,\r\nand as embracing about two-fifths of the total area of continental\r\nUnited States, exclusive of Alaska. The superficial area of the several\r\nstates that comprise this desert is almost equal to the combined areas\r\nof Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Germany, Belgium, France, Italy,\r\nthe British Isles, Austro-Hungary, Spain, Portugal, the Balkan States,\r\nTurkey in Europe, and Japan. The population of the so-called desert\r\nstates[A] is 16,423,625, while that of the countries above-mentioned is\r\nover twelve times as great. Within the confines of the desert is every\r\ngradation of climate from north temperate to semi-tropic found in these\r\nEuropean countries. Its physical geography includes a wide variety of\r\nfeatures from the Great Plains to the highest and lowest elevations\r\nin our country. Herein are found the most notable scenic attractions,\r\nincluding the great national playgrounds of Yellowstone, Glacier, Rocky\r\nMountain, Mount Rainier, Crater Lake and Yosemite National Parks, the\r\nGrand Canyon of Arizona, and the principal national forests.\r\n\r\n[A] Arizona, New Mexico, California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Utah,\r\nIdaho, Montana, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, North and South Dakota,\r\nOklahoma.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST FLOW OF WATER\r\n\r\nIn Grand Valley Project, Colorado]\r\n\r\nAs to water supply, the desert belongs in two regions, arid and\r\nsemi-arid. West of the Missouri and extending to the foot of the Rocky\r\nMountains, is a vast area of foothills and gently sloping, grassy\r\nprairies, which constitute a large part of the semi-arid or sub-humid\r\nregion of the United States. This broad belt, stretching from Mexico\r\nnorthward into Canada, has no clear-cut boundary separating it from\r\nthe humid region on the east or the arid region on the west, owing to\r\nthe variance of the mean annual precipitation in many localities. A\r\nconvenient and easily marked line for the eastern boundary of the arid\r\nregion is one closely following the hundred and third meridian. On the\r\nnorth it bends away from the meridian toward the west, and on the south\r\ntends eastward north of the Rio Grande. On the west the arid region\r\nextends to the Pacific Coast in extreme southern California, but from\r\nMonterey north there is a narrow belt of semi-arid and humid country\r\nbordering the Pacific Ocean. The Coast Range is humid, especially in\r\nOregon and Washington, where the rainfall is as heavy as in any other\r\npart of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORTY BUSHELS OF WHEAT PER ACRE\r\n\r\nShoshone Project, Wyoming. This was desert land in 1915]\r\n\r\nThe true desert, wherein the production of crops is wholly dependent\r\nupon the artificial application of water, lies for the most part west\r\nof the Rocky Mountains. Its estimated area, 900,000 square miles,\r\nis probably slightly greater than that of the semi-arid region. An\r\naccurate determination of the relative size of each, however, is not\r\npossible until a comprehensive hydrographic survey has been completed.\r\nContrary to popular opinion, this region is not a vast wilderness,\r\ndesolate and unpromising. Between the mountain ranges lie many\r\nbeautiful valleys, through which flow numerous streams fed by melting\r\nsnows. Utah and Nevada contain large areas of sage-brush desert,\r\ncomprising what is known as the Great Basin, which has no outlet to\r\nthe sea, and is doomed to aridity by reason of the absence of living\r\nstreams. Millions of acres of desert now inhabited by the coyote and\r\nthe rattlesnake await only the coming of the engineer to wake to\r\nteeming fecundity.\r\n\r\nIn one important respect the arid and semi-arid regions are alike, and\r\nthat is in the character of the streams. Almost without exception the\r\nrivers of the West are erratic and “flashy” in flow, are subject to\r\nlong periods of drought and sudden and destructive floods. The full\r\nutilization of these streams for irrigation and power necessitates\r\nstorage. In the control of floods, engineers have found their greatest\r\nproblem, and one whose solution has taxed the skill, imagination and\r\ndaring of twentieth-century genius.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHEAT ON SHOSHONE PROJECT, WYOMING\r\n\r\nThis land was desert in 1908]\r\n\r\n\r\n_National Irrigation_\r\n\r\nNational irrigation became a fixed policy of the American Government\r\nwith the passage of the Reclamation Act in June, 1902. The principal\r\nprovisions of this act are briefly as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst. A reclamation fund in the Treasury consisting of the proceeds\r\nfrom the sales of public lands in the sixteen arid and semi-arid\r\nstates.[A]\r\n\r\n[A] These include the states named in the first foot-note, with Texas\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAGE BRUSH AND ALFALFA, MINIDOKA PROJECT, IDAHO\r\n\r\nOn one side of the fence is the desert sage brush, on the other rich\r\nalfalfa]\r\n\r\nSecond. A Reclamation Service in the Department of the Interior to\r\ninvestigate and report on the irrigation projects to the Secretary\r\nof the Interior, who, with the approval of Congress, may authorize\r\nconstruction and let contracts, providing the money is available in the\r\nfund.\r\n\r\nThird. The return to the fund of the actual cost of each project by the\r\nsale of water rights, payments to be made in a series of instalments\r\nrunning over a period of twenty years without interest. The money so\r\nreturned is to be used again and again on other works.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A COMFORTABLE “DESERT” HOME\r\n\r\nHaving electric power for heat, light and cooking]\r\n\r\nFourth. The holding of public lands for actual settlers under the\r\nhomestead act in small farm units sufficient to support a family.\r\n\r\nFifth. The sale of water rights to private land owners, but not for\r\nmore than 160 acres.\r\n\r\nSixth. The ultimate turning over to the people of the irrigation\r\nsystem, to be operated and managed by them under a system of home rule.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIGH SCHOOL BUILDING, MINIDOKA PROJECT\r\n\r\nThis beautiful, fully equipped school stands where there was only\r\ndesert in 1907]\r\n\r\nThe policy of national irrigation is broadly paternal and of enormous\r\neconomic importance to the whole country. In the building of new\r\ncommonwealths in the arid West the Government is utilizing its own\r\nundeveloped resources. It is creating opportunities for its citizens to\r\nestablish themselves in permanent homes in which patriotism, loyalty\r\nand civic pride are bred and fostered. For a number of years the growth\r\nof population has been abnormal when compared with the development\r\nof the agricultural industries that must support the people. Farming\r\nas a profession has been languishing and falling behind the general\r\ndevelopment of the country. The rapid increase in land values has\r\nmade it correspondingly more difficult for the man of small means to\r\nacquire a foothold on the land. Practically every progressive nation\r\nin the world has come to recognize this fact, and is making provisions\r\nto encourage and assist its citizens to undertake farming. The primary\r\npurpose of the Reclamation Law, therefore, is to make homes on the\r\nland. To the new empire in the West have flocked the young, the strong,\r\nthe adventurous, and herein we are witnessing a gradual welding of\r\nall the Aryan races into a final race type. Signs are not lacking\r\nthat this type in time will dominate the world, for the desert offers\r\nto every man his true birthright--room to breathe, sunshine, a sure\r\nreward for intelligent labor, the individual home, and an opportunity\r\nto become independent. Desert reclamation already has gone beyond the\r\nstage of prophecy. The material and substantial results that have been\r\naccomplished place the work of the Government on a practical and solid\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Romance of Reclamation_\r\n\r\nThe history of national reclamation is as interesting and romantic\r\nas a tale from the Arabian Nights. Romance colored the vision of\r\nbuilders that saw in the sparkling streamlets, the unchecked floods,\r\nthe wide, free plains and the vacant mountain valleys a promise of\r\nindependence, happy homes and laughing children. Theirs was not the\r\nincentive of large emoluments, for Government salaries are notoriously\r\nmeager. Their inspiration came from doing a signal work of splendid\r\nusefulness,--conquering nature in her unfriendliest mood for the\r\npermanent and lasting good of mankind. As they toiled in the fastnesses\r\nof the mountains, in abysmal canyons or far out in the voiceless\r\ndesert, through the blazing summer heat of the Southwest or the fierce\r\nblizzards of the northern plains, this thought was uppermost, “By this\r\nwork we shall make the desert blossom.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHICKENS THRIVE\r\n\r\nIn the dry climate of the desert]\r\n\r\nTheir dramatic achievements stand out boldly in this age of engineering\r\ntriumphs. The mighty floods of western rivers have been checked behind\r\nenormous masonry dams, several of which are ranked among the highest\r\nin the world. Physical geography has been altered by transferring\r\nrivers from one drainage basin into that of another. Whole rivers are\r\nnow flowing through tunnels that pierce lofty mountain ranges, and the\r\nwater is being distributed in thousands of miles of canals to a million\r\nacres of desert.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST SETTLERS ON DESERT LANDS\r\n\r\nSettlers’ houses where once was the haunt of the buffalo]\r\n\r\nOwing to limitation of space only a few of these interesting irrigation\r\nprojects of the United States Federal Government are here mentioned,\r\nalthough each is worthy of extended description. The annual reports of\r\nthe Service are obtainable from the Superintendent of Public Documents\r\nin Washington, and these contain full details.\r\n\r\nIn the order of their magnitude and the spectacular character of the\r\nengineering work, the Arrowrock dam in Idaho, Elephant Butte dam in\r\nNew Mexico, Roosevelt dam in Arizona, Shoshone and Pathfinder dams in\r\nWyoming, and Gunnison tunnel in Colorado, take first rank. Several of\r\nthese are described at length elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OREGON MELON PATCH]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Most Capacious Irrigation Reservoir_\r\n\r\nIn a region rich in thrilling reminiscence along the pathway trod\r\nby the Conquistadores of Spain, Federal engineers recently completed\r\na monumental structure of masonry known as the Elephant Butte dam in\r\nNew Mexico. This enormous mass of rock and cement effectually and\r\npermanently blocks the canyon of the Rio Grande just below the isolated\r\nbasaltic peak from which it derives its name. It rises from the depths\r\nof the canyon 318 feet, and its crest length is 1674 feet. It owes\r\nits place among the greatest structures of the age to the enormous\r\ncapacity of the reservoir created by it. Behind this towering monolith\r\nthe greatest floods of the turbulent Rio Grande are held in a lake\r\nforty-five miles long and four miles wide. When full it will contain\r\nenough water to cover 2,627,700 acres to the depth of a foot, or\r\nsufficient to submerge the entire State of Connecticut ten inches deep.\r\nThis stored water, when needed for irrigation, is turned back into the\r\nriver and taken out at several points above and below El Paso, Texas;\r\n180,000 acres in New Mexico, Texas and Old Mexico are being brought\r\ninto cultivation. The charm of antiquity pervades the whole region.\r\nHere irrigation was practiced long before the first written word of\r\nour history. Centuries before the coming of the Spanish missionaries,\r\na pastoral race dwelt here and cultivated this fertile valley along\r\nthe stream. A later civilization merely absorbed and extended the\r\nprimitive canals until the era of national reclamation aroused the\r\nvalley to new life and purpose. While some of the primitive methods\r\nof agriculture, differing but slightly from those of Biblical days,\r\nare still practiced, modern harvesting machinery is replacing the hand\r\nsickle, the sulky plow supplants the sharpened stick, and the threshing\r\nof grain is now performed by modern methods, and rarely by means of\r\ngoats and ponies. Splendid highways of concrete and macadam connect the\r\nfarming communities with numerous thriving towns, and the quaint groups\r\nof adobe houses, which here and there rise in the desert, are the\r\nlast remains of vanishing races that are slowly giving way to modern\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIX YEARS FROM DESERT LAND\r\n\r\nA rich and fruitful farm on land barren in 1912]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Shoshone Dam_\r\n\r\nIn northern Wyoming, near the eastern entrance to Yellowstone National\r\nPark, the South and North Forks of Shoshone River plunge downward from\r\nthe steep slopes of the Rockies and unite in a broad level-floored\r\nvalley which in early geological times was a beautiful mountain lake.\r\nAt the lower end of the valley the river rushes abruptly into a deep\r\nand narrow canyon. The entrance to the canyon, which is only sixty feet\r\nwide at the bottom, was selected as the site for the Shoshone dam.\r\nBefore construction began it was necessary to blast a highway through\r\nthe gorge for a distance of eight miles, in order to connect the work\r\nwith the nearest railway. This highway is now a part of the road system\r\ninto the Park, and is known as Cody Way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRYING ALMONDS\r\n\r\nOn the Orland Project, California]\r\n\r\nNearly a year was spent in investigating bed rock conditions before the\r\nfoundation was placed. Enormous boulders eighty feet in thickness were\r\ndiscovered in the bed of the stream; the removal of these, owing to the\r\nnarrowness and depth of the canyon, proved expensive and difficult.\r\nBefore any work was undertaken in clearing the channel of obstructions,\r\nthe river was passed around the dam site by means of a tunnel. During\r\nthe early period of construction the laborers were taken to and from\r\ntheir work, hundreds of feet below the camp, by means of baskets, and\r\nskips were suspended on cable ways across the gorge. Sudden floods,\r\nextreme cold weather, short seasons, and other unfavorable conditions\r\ngreatly retarded progress.\r\n\r\nThe dam is a wedge of concrete, with curve up stream, 328 feet in\r\nheight, and 200 feet long on top. It has restored the lake of olden\r\ntimes, and this beautiful body of water is now one of the attractions\r\nof the trip to the Park. The stored water will be utilized for the\r\nirrigation of 150,000 acres of land on the mesa (a high, broad, flat\r\ntable-land) below Cody. This region until 1907 was a worthless and\r\nuninhabited desert. Today it is occupied by more than 700 farm families\r\nand three growing towns.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conquering the American Nile_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAGUNA DAM, ARIZONA-CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\nLength, 4781 feet; 19 feet high. Division Gates, 17×33 feet, are the\r\nlargest in the world]\r\n\r\nThe delta of the Colorado River, in Arizona and California, is often\r\ndescribed as America’s Valley of the Nile. In climate, soil and\r\nagricultural conditions it is singularly like the great valley of\r\nEgypt. The conquest of this turbulent river of the West was a splendid\r\nachievement. The engineering features of the Yuma project, in Arizona\r\nand California, are in many respects original. The control of the\r\nstream called for a long diversion dam and more than 100 miles of\r\nstrong levees. The dam is nearly a mile long, nineteen feet high,\r\nand 267 feet wide on the bottom. Its type is similar to that of the\r\nbarrages of the English engineers in India. Laid on a foundation of\r\nshifting sand and silt, it is held in place by its enormous weight,\r\n600,000 tons. Owing to the quantities of silt carried by this stream,\r\nthe dam is provided with a large settling basin, sluiceway and gates,\r\nby which comparatively clear water is turned into the canals. The main\r\ncanal system extends for twelve miles on the California side. Just\r\nopposite the city of Yuma, Arizona, the entire volume, 1,000 cubic feet\r\nper second, is dropped in a siphon 1,000 feet long and carried under\r\nthe river to the Arizona side. Here are 90,000 acres of valley and mesa\r\nland, and more than half of the area is being developed intensively.\r\nThe soil is of great depth and extremely fertile, and the climate is\r\nadapted to the growing of a wide variety of crops. The mesa lands which\r\nare to be opened later are described as frostless, and especially\r\nadapted to growing citrus and other semi-tropic crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Pathfinder Dam_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAND RIVER, ROLLER-TOP DIVISION DAM, COLORADO\r\n\r\nElectrically operated rollers are lifted to pass the floods]\r\n\r\nFar from the beaten path of man, fifty miles from the nearest railway\r\nin a deep and narrow granite canyon of the North Platte River, in\r\nsouthern Wyoming, engineers in 1903 located an admirable site for a\r\nhigh masonry dam. Early maps of the expedition of Gen. John C. Frémont,\r\nthe explorer, indicated the spot as the scene of a disaster where these\r\nadventurers suffered the wreck of their boats and the loss of many\r\nbelongings in the rapids of the river. Hence the name Pathfinder dam.\r\nThis is a beautiful structure of huge granite blocks 225 feet high and\r\n600 feet long on top, and its cost was $1,000,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOSHONE RESERVOIR, WYOMING]\r\n\r\nJudged from the service it has rendered mankind already, as a\r\npreventive against disastrous floods and a guarantor of generous\r\nharvests, it deserves a high place among the storage structures of the\r\nworld. Since its completion the North Platte River has been completely\r\ntamed, and angry floods that once wrought millions of dollars of\r\ndestruction are now so distributed as to insure an annual harvest\r\nvalued at $6,000,000 in a region once occupied only by nomadic herdsmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Transferring a River_\r\n\r\nThe waters of the Strawberry River in Utah, which for ages flowed\r\nidly to the Pacific Ocean, are today contributing to the material\r\nprosperity of a beautiful valley in the drainage of Great Salt Lake.\r\nThe transferrence of a river from its own drainage into that of another\r\nhas been performed by the Federal engineers on several occasions,\r\nnotably in Colorado, where the Gunnison River is augmenting the flow of\r\nthe Uncompahgre, the St. Mary River in Montana (a former tributary of\r\nthe Arctic Ocean, now transferred to Atlantic drainage) and the Truckee\r\nRiver in Nevada, now consolidated with the Carson River.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PATHFINDER DAM, WYOMING\r\n\r\n218 feet high, 600 feet long at top. Irrigates 220,000 acres; cost,\r\n$1,000,000]\r\n\r\nStrawberry Valley, Utah, in the heart of the lofty Wasatch Range, has\r\nbeen converted into a large lake by means of a dam in Strawberry River.\r\nThe stored waters are turned through a tunnel four miles long, piercing\r\nthe range, and dropped into Utah Valley on the Western slope. By means\r\nof sixty miles of cement-lined canals skirting the mountains, an area\r\nof 60,000 acres of excellent agricultural land has been reclaimed.\r\nThe downward rush of water has been harnessed, and the surplus power\r\ndeveloped is leased to several of the towns in the valley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELEPHANT BUTTE DAM, NEW MEXICO\r\n\r\nHeight, 318 feet; length at top, 1674 feet. Creates largest artificial\r\nreservoir for irrigation in the world]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reclamation Past and Future_\r\n\r\nFifteen years have passed since reclamation became a Federal policy,--a\r\nshort period in a nation’s life if measured only in time, but one of\r\nhistoric importance when measured by achievement and progress. In\r\nthis brief span of years the Service has completed sixteen notable\r\nstructures of masonry and concrete, controlling the floods of\r\ntorrential streams, has excavated more than 10,000 miles of canals,\r\nmany of which carry whole rivers, and seventy miles of tunnels, mostly\r\nin mountains. It has to its credit the highest dam, the longest tunnel\r\nand the largest storage reservoir for irrigation in the world. By an\r\ninvestment of $120,000,000, which is repayable by the farmers in twenty\r\nyears, the productive territory of the nation has been expanded by\r\nmore than a million acres, and there has resulted an annual increase\r\nin its food supply valued at $50,000,000. Where once the wilderness\r\nreigned, the hearth-stones of 200,000 people have been erected, and a\r\ncitizenship established which constitutes a new bulwark of American\r\nliberty, and bulkhead the flood waters of anarchy. Thrilling, dynamic,\r\nand inspirational, this work quickens patriotic impulses and stimulates\r\nlove for the republic that has promoted it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OUTLET OF THE STRAWBERRY VALLEY TUNNEL\r\n\r\nFour miles long, and connecting Pacific Ocean drainage with that of our\r\ngreat interior basin]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reclamation Plans_\r\n\r\nThe plans of the Reclamation Service for the present and for the\r\nimmediate future are centered upon the completion of twenty-six\r\nprojects, embracing a total of 3,118,000 acres. To date, engineering\r\nworks have made available an adequate water supply for approximately\r\n1,800,000 acres. In 1917, water was applied to about 1,200,000 acres,\r\nand the gross value of crops was nearly $60,000,000. It is conservative\r\nto state that with the irrigation of all the lands included in these\r\nprojects, 50,000 families will have been established on individual\r\nfarms. The taxable wealth will be augmented by $300,000,000, and our\r\nannual returns from crops increased by $100,000,000. The area included\r\nin these projects exceeds the total cropped acreage of Connecticut,\r\nVermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Delaware, and the estimated\r\nvalue of crops after reclamation is $20,000,000 greater than the total\r\nreturns per annum of these states. In these estimates no account\r\nis taken of the important increment to our national wealth in the\r\nresulting growth of cities and towns, in the building of railroads,\r\nand in manufacturing and commercial institutions, which in aggregate\r\nusually equals that of land values.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEW HOME ON THE DESERT]\r\n\r\nIn fulfilling its manifest destiny, the West has undertaken the\r\ngreatest and most splendid enterprise in the world--the upbuilding\r\nof Man. It is doing for the world what the world needs most. It is\r\nproducing a great people. The sentiment of it has been expressed in\r\neloquent terms by the late Henry Grady, “A citizen,” he said, “standing\r\nin the doorway of his home, contented on his own threshold, his family\r\ngathered about him, while the evening of a well-spent day closes in\r\nscenes that are dearest,--he shall save the republic when the drum\r\ntap is futile and the barracks are deserted.” This pregnant sentence\r\nepitomizes the final chapter of our Romance of the Desert, as it is now\r\nbeing written in the arid West.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRODUCTS OF THE DESERT]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_SUPPLEMENTARY READING_\r\n\r\nRECLAIMING THE ARID WEST _By George Wharton James_\r\n\r\nUNCLE SAM’S OUTDOOR MAGIC _By P. K. Fitzhugh_\r\n\r\nDOCUMENTS ISSUED BY THE U. S. RECLAMATION SERVICE AND DEPARTMENT OF\r\nAGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\n⁂ Information concerning the above books may be had on application to\r\nthe Editor of The Mentor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OPEN LETTER\r\n\r\n\r\nOn reading Mr. Blanchard’s account of the work of reclaiming the desert\r\nfor the people, the natural question that arises in the reader’s mind\r\nis, “How does one get a government farm and what are the expenses\r\ninvolved?” Anticipating this question, I obtained information from Mr.\r\nBlanchard in reply to it. Getting a farm is comparatively a simple\r\nproposition. Making good on it is quite another matter. In the first\r\ninstance, the Government has made the way easy and inexpensive. Any\r\ncitizen of the United States who has not used his homestead right is\r\nqualified to make a filing on any surveyed public lands not withdrawn\r\nfrom entry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The procedure is about as follows. After a personal inspection\r\n    of the vacant land desired for a home, the homeseeker\r\n    makes application to the proper local Land Office or Land\r\n    Commissioner and deposits filing fees of $8 for an 80-acre\r\n    or $16 for a 160-acre tract. If the entry is made on an\r\n    irrigation project, usually he must pay, in addition to the\r\n    above, five per cent of the building charge, and, when due, the\r\n    annual charge for operation and maintenance. On the projects\r\n    containing lands now open to entry, the building charge ranges\r\n    from $30 to $75 per acre, and is payable in twenty years\r\n    without interest. The charge for operation and maintenance\r\n    averages about $1.50 per acre, and is payable annually. This\r\n    charge will vary on the different projects and according to\r\n    the amount of water used. Summing up the initial cost of\r\n    obtaining a Government irrigated farm of 40 acres, the settler\r\n    will find it necessary to expend $6.50 for filing fees; if the\r\n    construction charge is $50 per acre, he will pay $100 for the\r\n    first instalment and, when due, about $60 for the operation and\r\n    maintenance assessment--a total of approximately $166.50.\r\n\r\n    In the second, third, fourth and fifth years following, the\r\n    only payments required are the annual charges for operation\r\n    and maintenance, about $60. Thus in five years the settler is\r\n    obliged to pay to the Government approximately $406.50.\r\n\r\n    The balance of the unpaid construction charges are payable in\r\n    fifteen annual instalments, beginning on December 1 of the\r\n    fifth year, the first five of which are each 5 per cent and the\r\n    remaining ten 7 per cent of the construction charge, without\r\n    interest for the deferred payments.\r\n\r\n    The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to require the\r\n    reclamation for agricultural purposes and the cultivation of\r\n    one-fourth of the irrigable area within three full irrigation\r\n    seasons, and of one-half of the irrigable area within five full\r\n    seasons. Actual residence, covering a period of three years, is\r\n    obligatory.\r\n\r\n    On the basis of a construction charge of $50 per acre, and an\r\n    annual operation and maintenance charge of $1.50 per acre,\r\n    the entire investment of the settler at the end of the twenty\r\n    years’ term will be as follows:\r\n\r\n      Filing fees                      $6.50\r\n      Construction charges          2,000.00\r\n      Operation assessments         1,700.00\r\n                                    --------\r\n            Total                  $3,706.50\r\n\r\n    For a farm on public lands outside of an irrigation project the\r\n    only payment required is the filing fee at the time of entry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHow much capital should a man have to take up an irrigated farm? It\r\nis extremely difficult to answer this question. Experience has shown\r\nthat success depends about 75 per cent on the individual. The chief\r\nrequisites for success may be stated as _energy_, _business ability_,\r\n_judgment_, _capital_ and _experience_. Experience has been placed\r\nlast for the reason that it has been shown repeatedly that experience\r\nin farming in humid regions is not a particularly valuable asset in\r\nirrigated farming.\r\n\r\nIt may, therefore, be said that the average man who takes up a\r\nGovernment irrigated farm of 40 acres should possess a capital of at\r\nleast $2,500, and not less than $4,000 if he undertakes to subdue an\r\n80-acre tract.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs we ride on the overland trains across the great desert stretches of\r\nthe far West, our eyes are fed full of color. In the midst of the riot\r\nof rich tints, we turn eagerly to occasional green spots that relieve\r\nthe blazing beauty of the landscape, and our glances linger there with\r\na sense of rest. These green spots are desert farms--fresh oases where,\r\nunder the spell of water, the soil is wakening from its centuries of\r\nslumber and yielding up its stored wealth. These desert farms make a\r\nstrong, human appeal to the passing traveler. They tell an assuring\r\nstory of man’s return to the soil and of rich returns from the soil--a\r\nstory of well-being and content attained, in substantial, comfortable\r\nhomes. In some such modest way as pictured on the preceding page the\r\nsettler begins his conquest of the desert. The measure of his success\r\nand prosperity lies in his hands. The wealth is there ready to be\r\nharvested.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W. D. Moffat\r\n\r\nEDITOR]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUncle Sam a Generous Giver\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American Government has given of its resources as no nation ever\r\ndid before or ever can again. To thirteen Western States alone over a\r\nhundred million acres have been given. The peoples of the world have\r\nbeen called in and tendered homes. Now, out of an area within the\r\nUnited States of a billion and a half acres of public domain, we have\r\nleft as public lands subject to disposal as homesteads and otherwise\r\nless than 280,000,000 acres, not one-half of which, it may safely be\r\nsaid, will ever prove to be cultivable. In one year the Department\r\nof the Interior issued over 60,000 patents to land--donations from\r\nthe nation to the courageous pioneer. Any man who finds gold, silver,\r\ncopper or other minerals on his grant has them for the asking--a prize\r\nfor discovery.\r\n\r\nAll the revenue from the sale of public lands (less five per cent,\r\nwhich goes to the States) goes into a fund for the building of\r\nirrigation works to reclaim the desert. Over a hundred million dollars\r\nhave been so spent, which is, however, no more than a loan to the\r\nfarmers. Before attempting the governmental construction of such work\r\nthe Federal Government said to the States, “If you will irrigate\r\nthe lands of your State, or if there are private individuals who\r\nwill do this work, we will give you whatever land you desire up to\r\n1,000,000 acres each, and set it apart for ten years while you try the\r\nexperiment.” Was there ever a more generous method taken of populating\r\nand developing a new land? Those that took its lands were not asked for\r\neven so much as the cost of their administration.\r\n\r\nIn doing all this with so lavish a hand the Government has been\r\nexpressing the generous instinct of the people and their absorbing\r\ndetermination to “go forth and find.” For a hundred years and more this\r\nquest has been the drama of our national life. It has given color to\r\nour civilization and buoyancy to the hearts of the people. It has been\r\na century of revelation, and as yet we have only the most superficial\r\nknowledge of what this land is, of what it will yield to research, and\r\nhow it may be best used.\r\n\r\nBut in all our giving we have been guided by a purpose--the land that\r\nwe gave was to be converted from wilderness into homes, or from rock\r\ninto metal. We gave to the homesteader, with a condition--_the land\r\nwas to be used_. We gave our swamp lands, but to be reclaimed. We\r\nfound our coal lands going as farms and we put a price upon them. We\r\nsaw our forests being swept clean or monopolized and we held them out\r\nfor the mass. Use! Use by as many as possible! The superior use! These\r\nwere the things we wished and these gave form to our legislation. The\r\nhomesteader may have 320 acres if it is dry farming or grazing land.\r\nBut he cannot have it as a speculation. It must be made a home and\r\nbrought into the body of the world’s producing area by cultivation. The\r\nGovernment was generous, but it had no intention of being a spendthrift.\r\n\r\nLands and resources are at the full service of the people. And yet the\r\nromantic enterprise of revealing America is not done. To get from our\r\nresources their fullest use--this is our goal. And this is nothing less\r\nthan a challenge to the capacity of democracy.\r\n\r\nAbstract from Report of the Secretary of the Interior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MENTOR\r\n\r\nA New Volume in the Mentor Library\r\n\r\n\r\n    It gives us great pleasure to advise our friends that the sixth\r\n    volume of The Mentor Library is now ready for distribution.\r\n    It contains issues one hundred twenty-one to one hundred\r\n    forty-four inclusive, and is, in every particular, uniform with\r\n    the volumes previously issued.\r\n\r\nOne of the great advantages of owning The Mentor Library is that\r\nit grows in value from year to year--giving an endless supply of\r\ninstructive and wonderfully illustrated material that would be\r\nimpossible to obtain elsewhere.
