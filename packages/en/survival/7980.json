HYDROGRAPHICAL SURVEYING\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nThese notes are internal primarily for those engineers who,\r\nhaving a general knowledge of sewerage, are called upon to\r\nprepare a scheme for a sea coast town, or are desirous of being\r\nable to meet such a call when made. Although many details of\r\nthe subject have been dealt with separately in other volumes,\r\nthe writer has a very vivid recollection of the difficulties he\r\nexperienced in collecting the knowledge he required when he was\r\nfirst called on to prepare such a scheme, particularly with\r\nregard to taking and recording current and tidal observations,\r\nand it is in the hope that it might be helpful to others in a\r\nsimilar difficulty to have all the information then obtained,\r\nand that subsequently gained on other schemes, brought together\r\nwithin a small compass that this book has written.\r\n\r\n60, Queen Victoria St,\r\nLondon, E.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE FORMATION OF TIDES AND CURRENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has often been stated that no two well-designed sewerage\r\nschemes are alike, and although this truism is usually applied\r\nto inland towns, it applies with far greater force to schemes\r\nfor coastal towns and towns situated on the banks of our large\r\nrivers where the sewage is discharged into tidal waters. The\r\nessence of good designing is that every detail shall be\r\ncarefully thought out with a view to meeting the special\r\nconditions of the case to the best advantage, and at the least\r\npossible expense, so that the maximum efficiency is combined\r\nwith the minimum cost. It will therefore be desirable to\r\nconsider the main conditions governing the design of schemes\r\nfor sea-coast towns before describing a few typical cases of\r\nsea outfalls. Starting with the postulate that it is essential\r\nfor the sewage to be effectually and permanently disposed of\r\nwhen it is discharged into tidal waters, we find that this\r\nresult is largely dependent on the nature of the currents,\r\nwhich in their turn depend upon the rise and fall of the tide,\r\ncaused chiefly by the attraction of the moon, but also to a\r\nless extent by the attraction of the sun. The subject of sewage\r\ndisposal in tidal waters, therefore, divides itself naturally\r\ninto two parts: first, the consideration of the tides and\r\ncurrents; and, secondly, the design of the works.\r\n\r\nThe tidal attraction is primarily due to the natural effect of\r\ngravity, whereby the attraction between two bodies is in direct\r\nproportion to the product of their respective masses and in\r\ninverse proportion to the square of their distance apart; but\r\nas the tide-producing effect of the sun and moon is a\r\ndifferential attraction, and not a direct one, their relative\r\neffect is inversely as the cube of their distances. The mass of\r\nthe sun is about 324,000 times as great as that of the earth,\r\nand it is about 93 millions of miles away, while the mass of\r\nthe moon is about 1-80th of that of the earth, but it averages\r\nonly 240,000 miles away, varying between 220,000 miles when it\r\nis said to be in perigee, and 260,000 when in apogee. The\r\nresultant effect of each of these bodies is a strong \"pull\" of\r\nthe earth towards them, that of the moon being in excess of\r\nthat of the sun as 1 is to 0.445, because, although its mass is\r\nmuch less than that of the sun, it is considerably nearer to\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nAbout one-third of the surface of the globe is occupied by\r\nland, and the remaining two-thirds by water. The latter, being\r\na mobile substance, is affected by this pull, which results in\r\na banking up of the water in the form of the crest of a tidal\r\nwave. It has been asserted in recent years that this tidal\r\naction also takes place in a similar manner in the crust of the\r\nearth, though in a lesser degree, resulting in a heaving up and\r\ndown amounting to one foot; but we are only concerned with the\r\naction of the sea at present. Now, although this pull is felt\r\nin all seas, it is only in the Southern Ocean that a sufficient\r\nexpanse of water exists for the tidal action to be fully\r\ndeveloped. This ocean has an average width of 1,500 miles, and\r\ncompletely encircles the earth on a circumferential line 13,500\r\nmiles long; in it the attraction of the sun and moon raises the\r\nwater nearest to the centre of attraction into a crest which\r\nforms high water at that place. At the same time, the water is\r\nacted on by the centripetal effect of gravity, which, tending\r\nto draw it as near as possible to the centre of the earth, acts\r\nin opposition to the attraction of the sun and moon, so that at\r\nthe sides of the earth 90 degrees away, where the attraction of\r\nthe sun and moon is less, the centripetal force has more\r\neffect, and the water is drawn so as to form the trough of the\r\nwave, or low water, at those points. There is also the\r\ncentrifugal force contained in the revolving globe, which has\r\nan equatorial diameter of about 8,000 miles and a circumference\r\nof 25,132 miles. As it takes 23 hr. 56 min 4 sec, or, say,\r\ntwenty-four hours, to make a complete revolution, the surface\r\nat the equator travels at a speed of approximately 25,132/24 =\r\n1,047 miles per hour. This centrifugal force is always\r\nconstant, and tends to throw the water off from the surface of\r\nthe globe in opposition to the centripetal force, which tends\r\nto retain the water in an even layer around the earth. It is\r\nasserted, however, as an explanation of the phenomenon which\r\noccurs, that the centripetal force acting at any point on the\r\nsurface of the earth varies inversely as the square of the\r\ndistance from that point to the moon, so that the centripetal\r\nforce acting on the water at the side of the earth furthest\r\nremoved from the moon is less effective than that on the side\r\nnearest to the moon, to the extent due to the length of the\r\ndiameter of the earth. The result of this is that the\r\ncentrifugal force overbalances the centripetal force, and the\r\nwater tends to fly off, forming an anti-lunar wave crest at\r\nthat point approximately equal, and opposite, to the wave crest\r\nat the point nearest to the moon. As the earth revolves, the\r\ncrest of high water of the lunar tide remains opposite the\r\ncentre of attraction of the sun and moon, so that a point on\r\nthe surface will be carried from high water towards and past\r\nthe trough of the wave, or low water, then past the crest of\r\nthe anti-lunar tide, or high water again, and back to its\r\noriginal position under the moon. But while the earth is\r\nrevolving the moon has traveled 13 degrees along the elliptical\r\norbit in which she revolves around the earth, from west to\r\neast, once in 27 days 7 hr. 43 min, so that the earth has to\r\nmake a fraction over a complete revolution before the same\r\npoint is brought under the centre of attraction again This\r\noccupies on an average 52 min, so that, although we are taught\r\nthat the tide regularly ebbs and flows twice in twenty-four\r\nhours, it will be seen that the tidal day averages 24 hr. 52\r\nmin, the high water of each tide in the Southern Ocean being at\r\n12 hr. 26 min intervals. As a matter of fact, the tidal day\r\nvaries from 24 hr. 35 min at new and full moon to 25 hr. 25 min\r\nat the quarters. Although the moon revolves around the earth in\r\napproximately 27-1/3 days, the earth has moved 27 degrees on\r\nits elliptical orbit around the sun, which it completes once in\r\n365± days, so that the period which elapses before the moon\r\nagain occupies the same relative position to the sun is 29 days\r\n12 hr. 43 min, which is the time occupied by the moon in\r\ncompleting her phases, and is known as a lunar month or a\r\nlunation.\r\n\r\nConsidered from the point of view of a person on the earth,\r\nthis primary tidal wave constantly travels round the Southern\r\nOcean at a speed of 13,500 miles in 24 hr. 52 min, thus having\r\na velocity of 543 miles per hour, and measuring a length of\r\n13,500/2 = 6,750 miles from crest to crest. If a map of the\r\nworld be examined it will be noticed that there are three large\r\noceans branching off the Southern Ocean, namely, the Atlantic,\r\nPacific, and Indian Oceans; and although there is the same\r\ntendency for the formation of tides in these oceans, they are\r\ntoo restricted for any very material tidal action to take\r\nplace. As the crest of the primary tidal wave in its journey\r\nround the world passes these oceans, the surface of the water\r\nis raised in them, which results in secondary or derivative\r\ntidal waves being sent through each ocean to the furthermost\r\nparts of the globe; and as the trough of the primary wave\r\npasses the same points the surface of the water is lowered, and\r\na reverse action takes place, so that the derivative waves\r\noscillate backwards and forwards in the branch oceans, the\r\ncomplete cycle occupying on the average 12 hr. 26 min Every\r\nvariation of the tides in the Southern Ocean is accurately\r\nreproduced in every sea connected with it.\r\n\r\nWave motion consists only in a vertical movement of the\r\nparticles of water by which a crest and trough is formed\r\nalternately, the crest being as much above the normal\r\nhorizontal line as the trough is below it; and in the tidal\r\nwaves this motion extends through the whole depth of the water\r\nfrom the surface to the bottom, but there is no horizontal\r\nmovement except of form. The late Mr. J. Scott Russell\r\ndescribed it as the transference of motion without the\r\ntransference of matter; of form without the substance; of force\r\nwithout the agent.\r\n\r\nThe action produced by the sun and moon jointly is practically\r\nthe resultant of the effects which each would produce\r\nseparately, and as the net tide-producing effect of the moon is\r\nto raise a crest of water 1.4 ft above the trough, and that of\r\nthe sun is 0.6 ft (being in the proportion of I to 0.445), when\r\nthe two forces are acting in conjunction a wave 1.4 + 0.6 = 2\r\nft high is produced in the Southern Ocean, and when acting in\r\nopposition a wave 1.4 - 0.6 = 0.8 ft high is formed. As the\r\nderivative wave, consisting of the large mass of water set in\r\nmotion by the comparatively small rise and fall of the primary\r\nwave, is propagated through the branch oceans, it is affected\r\nby many circumstances, such as the continual variation in width\r\nbetween the opposite shores, the alterations in the depth of\r\nthe channels, and the irregularity of the coast line. When\r\nobstruction occurs, as, for example, in the Bristol Channel,\r\nwhere there is a gradually rising bed with a converging\r\nchannel, the velocity, and/or the amount of rise and fall of\r\nthe derivative wave is increased to an enormous extent; in\r\nother places where the oceans widen out, the rise and/or\r\nvelocity is diminished, and similarly where a narrow channel\r\noccurs between two pieces of land an increase in the velocity\r\nof the wave will take place, forming a race in that locality.\r\n\r\nAlthough the laws governing the production of tides are well\r\nunderstood, the irregularities in the depths of the oceans and\r\nthe outlines of the coast, the geographical distribution of the\r\nwater over the face of the globe and the position and declivity\r\nof the shores greatly modify the movements of the tides and\r\ngive rise to so many complications that no general formulae can\r\nbe used to give the time or height of the tides at any place by\r\ncalculation alone. The average rate of travel and the course of\r\nthe flood tide of the derivative waves around the shores of\r\nGreat Britain are as follows:--150 miles per hour from Land's\r\nEnd to Lundy Island; 90 miles per hour from Lundy to St.\r\nDavid's Head; 22 miles per hour from St. David's Head to Holy\r\nhead; 45-1/2 miles per hour from Holyhead to Solway Firth; 194\r\nmiles per hour from the North of Ireland to the North of\r\nScotland; 52 miles per hour from the North of Scotland to the\r\nWash; 20 miles per hour from the Wash to Yarmouth; 10 miles per\r\nhour from Yarmouth to Harwich. Along the south coast from\r\nLand's End to Beachy Head the average velocity is 40 miles per\r\nhour, the rate reducing as the wave approaches Dover, in the\r\nvicinity of which the tidal waves from the two different\r\ndirections meet, one arriving approximately twelve hours later\r\nthan the other, thus forming tides which are a result of the\r\namalgamation of the two waves. On the ebb tide the direction of\r\nthe waves is reversed.\r\n\r\nThe mobility of the water around the earth causes it to be very\r\nsensitive to the varying attraction of the sun and moon, due to\r\nthe alterations from time to time in the relative positions of\r\nthe three bodies. Fig. [Footnote: Plate I] shows\r\ndiagrammatically the condition of the water in the Southern\r\nOcean when the sun and moon are in the positions occupied at\r\nthe time of new moon. The tide at A is due to the sum of the\r\nattractions of the sun and moon less the effect due to the\r\nexcess of the centripetal force over centrifugal force. The\r\ntide at C is due to the excess of the centrifugal force over\r\nthe centripetal force. These tides are known as \"spring\" tides.\r\nFig. 2 [Footnote: Plate I] shows the positions occupied at the\r\ntime of full moon. The tide at A is due to the attraction of\r\nthe sun plus the effect due to the excess of the centrifugal\r\nforce over the centripetal force. The tide at C is due to the\r\nattraction of the moon less the effect due to the excess of the\r\ncentripetal force over centrifugal force. These tides are also\r\nknown as \"spring\" tides. Fig. 3 [Footnote: Plate I] shows the\r\npositions occupied when the moon is in the first quarter; the\r\nposition at the third quarter being similar, except that the\r\nmoon would then be on the side of the earth nearest to B, The\r\ntide at A is compounded of high water of the solar tide\r\nsuperimposed upon low water of the lunar tide, so that the sea\r\nis at a higher level than in the case of the low water of\r\nspring tides. The tide at D is due to the attraction of the\r\nmoon less the excess of centripetal force over centrifugal\r\nforce, and the tide at B is due to the excess of centrifugal\r\nforce over centripetal force. These are known as \"neap\" tides,\r\nand, as the sun is acting in opposition to the moon, the height\r\nof high water is considerably less than at the time of spring\r\ntides. The tides are continually varying between these extremes\r\naccording to the alterations in the attracting forces, but the\r\njoint high tide lies nearer to the crest of the lunar than of\r\nthe solar tide. It is obvious that, if the attracting force of\r\nthe sun and moon were equal, the height of spring tides would\r\nbe double that due to each body separately, and that there\r\nwould be no variation in the height of the sea at the time of\r\nneap tides.\r\n\r\nIt will now be of interest to consider the minor movements of\r\nthe sun and moon, as they also affect the tides by reason of\r\nthe alterations they cause in the attractive force. During the\r\nrevolution of the earth round the sun the successive positions\r\nof the point on the earth which is nearest to the sun will form\r\na diagonal line across the equator. At the vernal equinox\r\n(March 20) the equator is vertically under the sun, which then\r\ndeclines to the south until the summer solstice (June 21), when\r\nit reaches its maximum south declination. It then moves\r\nnorthwards, passing vertically over the equator again at the\r\nautumnal equinox (September 21), and reaches its maximum\r\nnorthern declination on the winter solstice (December 21). The\r\ndeclination varies from about 24 degrees above to 24 degrees\r\nbelow the equator. The sun is nearest to the Southern Ocean,\r\nwhere the tides are generated, when it is in its southern\r\ndeclination, and furthest away when in the north, but the sun\r\nis actually nearest to the earth on December 31 (perihelion)\r\nand furthest away on July I (aphelion), the difference between\r\nthe maximum and minimum distance being one-thirtieth of the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nThe moon travels in a similar diagonal direction around the\r\nearth, varying between 18-1/2 degrees and 28-1/2 degreed above\r\nand below the equator. The change from north to south\r\ndeclination takes place every fourteen days, but these changes\r\ndo not necessarily take place at the change in the phases of\r\nthe moon. When the moon is south of the equator, she is nearer\r\nto the Southern Ocean, where the tides are generated. The new\r\nmoon is nearest to the sun, and crosses the meridian at midday,\r\nwhile the full moon crosses it at midnight.\r\n\r\nThe height of the afternoon tide varies from that of the\r\nmorning tide; sometimes one is the higher and sometimes the\r\nother, according to the declination of the sun and moon. This\r\nis called the \"diurnal inequality.\" The average difference\r\nbetween the night and morning tides is about 5 in on the east\r\ncoast and about 8in on the west coast. When there is a\r\nconsiderable difference in the height of high water of two\r\nconsecutive tides, the ebb which follows the higher tide is\r\nlower than that following the lower high water, and as a\r\ngeneral rule the higher the tide rises the lower it will fall.\r\nThe height of spring tides varies throughout the year, being at\r\na maximum when the sun is over the equator at the equinoxes and\r\nat a minimum in June at the summer solstice when the sun is\r\nfurthest away from the equator. In the Southern Ocean high\r\nwater of spring tides occurs at mid-day on the meridian of\r\nGreenwich and at midnight on the 180° meridian, and is later on\r\nthe coasts of other seas in proportion to the time taken for\r\nthe derivative waves to reach them, the tide being about three-\r\nfourths of a day later at Land's End and one day and a half\r\nlater at the mouth of the Thames. The spring tides around the\r\ncoast of England are four inches higher on the average at the\r\ntime of new moon than at full moon, the average rise being\r\nabout 15 ft, while the average rise at neaps is 11 ft 6 in.\r\n\r\nThe height from high to low water of spring tides is\r\napproximately double that of neap tides, while the maximum\r\nheight to which spring tides rise is about 33 per cent. more\r\nthan neaps, taking mean low water of spring tides as the datum.\r\nExtraordinarily high tides may be expected when the moon is new\r\nor full, and in her position nearest to the earth at the same\r\ntime as her declination is near the equator, and they will be\r\nstill further augmented if a strong gale has been blowing for\r\nsome time in the same direction as the flood tide in the open\r\nsea, and then changes when the tide starts to rise, so as to\r\nblow straight on to the shore. The pressure of the air also\r\naffects the height of tides in so far as an increase will tend\r\nto depress the water in one place, and a reduction of pressure\r\nwill facilitate its rising elsewhere, so that if there is a\r\nsteep gradient in the barometrical pressure falling in the same\r\ndirection as the flood tide the tides will be higher. As\r\nexemplifying the effect of violent gales in the Atlantic on the\r\ntides of the Bristol Channel, the following extract from \"The\r\nSurveyor, Engineer, and Architect\" of 1840, dealing with\r\nobservations taken on Mr. Bunt's self-registering tide gauge at\r\nHotwell House, Clifton, may be of interest.\r\n\r\nDate:           Times of High Water.      Difference in\r\nJan 1840.      Tide Gauge.  Tide Table.    Tide Table.\r\n                  H.M.         H.M.\r\n27th, p.m.......  0. 8 ....... 0. 7 .....  1 min earlier.\r\n28th, a.m.......  0.47 ....... 0.34 ..... 13 min earlier.\r\n28th, p.m....... 11.41 ....... 1. 7 ..... 86 min later.\r\n29th, a.m.......  1.29 ....... 1.47 ..... 18 min later.\r\n29th, p.m.......  2.32 ....... 2.30 .....  2 min earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the times of the tides varied so considerably, their\r\nheights were exactly as predicted in the tide-table.\r\n\r\nThe records during a storm on October 29, 1838, gave an\r\nentirely different result, as the time was retarded only ten or\r\ntwelve minutes, but the height was increased by 8 ft On another\r\noccasion the tide at Liverpool was increased 7 ft by a gale.\r\nThe Bristol Channel holds the record for the greatest tide\r\nexperienced around the shores of Great Britain, which occurred\r\nat Chepstow in 1883, and had a rise of 48 ft 6 in The\r\nconfiguration of the Bristol Channel is, of course, conducive\r\nto large tides, but abnormally high tides do not generally\r\noccur on our shores more frequently than perhaps once in ten\r\nyears, the last one occurring in the early part of 1904,\r\nalthough there may foe many extra high ones during this period\r\nof ten years from on-shore gales. Where tides approach a place\r\nfrom different directions there may be an interval between the\r\ntimes of arrival, which results in there being two periods of\r\nhigh and low water, as at Southampton, where the tides approach\r\nfrom each side of the Isle of Wight.\r\n\r\nThe hour at which high water occurs at any place on the coast\r\nat the time of new or full moon is known as the establishment\r\nof that place, and when this, together with the height to which\r\nthe tide rises above low water is ascertained by actual\r\nobservation, it is possible with the aid of the nautical\r\nalmanack to make calculations which will foretell the time and\r\nheight of the daily tides at that place for all future time. By\r\nmeans of a tide-predicting machine, invented by Lord Kelvin,\r\nthe tides for a whole year can be calculated in from three to\r\nfour hours. This machine is fully described in the Minutes of\r\nProceedings, Inst.C.E., Vol. LXV. The age of the tide at any\r\nplace is the period of time between new or full moon and the\r\noccurrence of spring tides at that place. The range of a tide\r\nis the height between high and low water of that tide, and the\r\nrise of a tide is the height between high water of that tide\r\nand the mean low water level of spring tides. It follows,\r\ntherefore, that for spring tides the range and rise are\r\nsynonymous terms, but at neap tides the range is the total\r\nheight between high and low water, while the rise is the\r\ndifference between high water of the neap tide and the mean low\r\nwater level of spring tides. Neither the total time occupied by\r\nthe flood and ebb tides nor the rate of the rise and fall are\r\nequal, except in the open sea, where there are fewer disturbing\r\nconditions. In restricted areas of water the ebb lasts longer\r\nthan the flood.\r\n\r\nAlthough the published tide-tables give much detailed\r\ninformation, it only applies to certain representative ports,\r\nand even then it is only correct in calm weather and with a\r\nvery steady wind, so that in the majority of cases the engineer\r\nmust take his own observations to obtain the necessary local\r\ninformation to guide him in the design of the works. It is\r\nimpracticable for these observations to be continued over the\r\nlengthy period necessary to obtain the fullest and most\r\naccurate results, but, premising a general knowledge of the\r\nnatural phenomena which affect the tides, as briefly described\r\nherein, he will be able to gauge the effect of the various\r\ndisturbing causes, and interpret the records he obtains so as\r\nto arrive at a tolerably accurate estimate of what may be\r\nexpected under any particular circumstances. Generally about 25\r\nper cent. of the tides in a year are directly affected by the\r\nwind, etc., the majority varying from 6 in to 12 in in height\r\nand from five to fifteen minutes in time. The effect of a\r\nmoderately stiff gale is approximately to raise a tide as many\r\ninches as it might be expected to rise in feet under normal\r\nconditions. The Liverpool tide-tables are based on observations\r\nspread over ten years, and even longer periods have been\r\nadopted in other places.\r\n\r\nMuch valuable information on this subject is contained in the\r\nfollowing books, among others--and the writer is indebted to\r\nthe various authors for some of the data contained in this and\r\nsubsequent chapters--\"The Tides,\" by G. H. Darwin, 1886;\r\nBaird's Manual of Tidal Observations, 1886; and \"Tides and\r\nWaves,\" by W. H. Wheeler, 1906, together with the articles in\r\nthe \"Encyclopaedia Britannica\" and \"Chambers's Encyclopaedia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\n\r\nObservations of the rise and fall of tides.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first step in the practical design of the sewage works is\r\nto ascertain the level of high and low water of ordinary spring\r\nand neap tides and of equinoctial tides, as well as the rate of\r\nrise and fall of the various tides. This is done by means of a\r\ntide recording instrument similar to Fig. 4, which represents\r\none made by Mr. J. H. Steward, of 457, West Strand, London,\r\nW.C. It consists of a drum about 5 in diameter and 10 in high,\r\nwhich revolves by clockwork once in twenty-four hours, the same\r\nmechanism also driving a small clock. A diagram paper divided\r\nwith vertical lines into twenty-four primary spaces for the\r\nhours is fastened round the drum and a pen or pencil attached\r\nto a slide actuated by a rack or toothed wheel is free to work\r\nvertically up and down against the drum. A pinion working in\r\nthis rack or wheel is connected with a pulley over which a\r\nflexible copper wire passes through the bottom of the case\r\ncontaining the gauge to a spherical copper float, 8 inches\r\ndiameter, which rises and falls with the tide, so that every\r\nmovement of the tide is reproduced moment by moment upon the\r\nchart as it revokes. The instrument is enclosed in an ebonized\r\ncabinet, having glazed doors in front and at both sides, giving\r\nconvenient access to all parts. Inasmuch as the height and the\r\ntime of the tide vary every day, it is practicable to read\r\nthree days' tides on one chart, instead changing it every day.\r\nWhen the diagrams are taken of, the lines representing the\r\nwater levels should be traced on to a continuous strip of\r\ntracing linen, so that the variations can be seen at a glance\r\nextra lines should be drawn, on the tracing showing the time at\r\nwhich the changes of the moon occur.\r\n\r\nFig. 5 is a reproduction to a small scale of actual records\r\ntaken over a period of eighteen days, which shows true\r\nappearance of the diagrams when traced on the continuous strip.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese observations show very little difference between the\r\nspring and neap tides, and are interesting as indicating the\r\nunreliability of basing general deductions upon data obtained\r\nduring a limited period only. At the time of the spring tides\r\nat the beginning of June the conditions were not favourable to\r\nbig tides, as although the moon was approaching her perigee,\r\nher declination had nearly reached its northern limit and the\r\ndeclination of the sun was 22° IN The first quarter of the moon\r\ncoincided very closely with the moon's passage over the\r\nequator, so that the neaps would be bigger than usual. At the\r\nperiod of the spring: tides, about the middle of June, although\r\nthe time of full moon corresponded with her southernmost\r\ndeclination, she was approaching her apogee, and the\r\ndeclination of the sun was 23° 16' N., so that the tides would\r\nbe lower than usual.\r\n\r\nIn order to ensure accurate observations, the position chosen\r\nfor the tide gauge should be in deep water in the immediate\r\nvicinity of the locus in quo, but so that it is not affected by\r\nthe waves from passing vessels. Wave motion is most felt where\r\nthe float is in shallow water. A pier or quay wall will\r\nprobably be most convenient, but in order to obtain records of\r\nthe whole range of the tides it is of course necessary that the\r\nfloat should not be left dry at low water. In some instances\r\nthe float is fixed in a well sunk above high water mark to such\r\na depth that the bottom of it is below the lowest low water\r\nlevel, and a small pipe is then laid under the beach from the\r\nwell to, and below, low water, so that the water stands\r\ncontinuously in the well at the same level as the sea.\r\n\r\nThe gauge should be fixed on bearers, about 3 ft 6 in from the\r\nfloor, in a wooden shed, similar to a watchman's box, but\r\nprovided with a door, erected on the pier or other site fixed\r\nupon for the observations. A hole must be formed in the floor\r\nand a galvanized iron or timber tube about 10 in square\r\nreaching to below low water level fixed underneath, so that\r\nwhen the float is suspended from the recording instrument it\r\nshall hang vertically down the centre of the tube. The shed\r\nand tube must of course be fixed securely to withstand wind and\r\nwaves. The inside of the tube must be free from all projections\r\nor floating matter which would interfere with the movements of\r\nthe float, the bottom should be closed, and about four lin\r\ndiameter holes should be cleanly formed in the sides near to\r\nthe bottom for the ingress and egress of the water. With a\r\nlarger number of holes the wave action will cause the diagram\r\nto be very indistinct, and probably lead to incorrectness in\r\ndetermining the actual levels of the tides; and if the tube is\r\nconsiderably larger than the float, the latter will swing\r\nlaterally and give incorrect readings.\r\n\r\n\r\nA bench mark at some known height above ordnance datum should\r\nbe set up in the hut, preferably on the top of the tube. At\r\neach visit the observer should pull the float wire down a short\r\ndistance, and allow it to return slowly, thus making a vertical\r\nmark on the diagram, and should then measure the actual level\r\nof the surface of the water below the bench mark in the hut, so\r\nthat the water line on the chart can be referred to ordnance\r\ndatum. He should also note the correct time from his watch, so\r\nas to subsequently rectify any inaccuracy in the rate of\r\nrevolution of the drum.\r\n\r\nThe most suitable period for taking these observations is from\r\nabout the middle of March to near the end of June, as this will\r\ninclude records of the high spring equinoctial tides and the\r\nlow \"bird\" tides of June. A chart similar to Fig. 6 should be\r\nprepared from the diagrams, showing the rise and fall of the\r\nhighest spring tides, the average spring tides, the average\r\nneap tides, and the lowest neap tides, which will be found\r\nextremely useful in considering the levels of, and the\r\ndischarge from, the sea outfall pipe.\r\n\r\nThe levels adopted for tide work vary in different ports.\r\nTrinity high-water mark is the datum adopted for the Port of\r\nLondon by the Thames Conservancy; it is the level of the lower\r\nedge of a stone fixed in the face of the river wall upon the\r\neast side of the Hermitage entrance of the London Docks, and is\r\n12 48 ft above Ordnance datum. The Liverpool tide tables give\r\nthe heights above the Old Dock Sill, which is now non-existent,\r\nbut the level of it has been carefully preserved near the same\r\nposition, on a stone built into the western wall of the Canning\r\nHalf Tide Dock. This level is 40 ft below Ordnance datum. At\r\nBristol the levels are referred to the Old Cumberland Basin\r\n(O.C.B.), which is an imaginary line 58 ft below Ordnance\r\ndatum. It is very desirable that for sewage work all tide\r\nlevels should be reduced to Ordnance datum.\r\n\r\nA critical examination of the charts obtained from the tide-\r\nrecording instruments will show that the mean level of the sea\r\ndoes not agree with the level of Ordnance datum. Ordnance datum\r\nis officially described as the assumed mean water level at\r\nLiverpool, which was ascertained from observations made by the\r\nOrdnance Survey Department in March, 1844, but subsequent\r\nrecords taken in May and June, 1859, by a self-recording gauge\r\non St. George's Pier, showed that the true mean level of the\r\nsea at Liverpool is 0.068 ft below the assumed level. The\r\ngeneral mean level of the sea around the coast of England, as\r\ndetermined by elaborate records taken at 29 places during the\r\nyears 1859-60, was originally said to be, and is still,\r\nofficially recognised by the Ordnance Survey Department to be\r\n0.65 ft, or 7.8 in, above Ordnance datum, but included in these\r\n29 stations were 8 at which the records were admitted to be\r\nimperfectly taken. If these 8 stations are omitted from the\r\ncalculations, the true general mean level of the sea would be\r\n0.623 ft, or 7.476 in, above Ordnance datum, or 0.691 ft above\r\nthe true mean level of the sea at Liverpool. The local mean\r\nseal level at various stations around the coast varies from\r\n0.982 ft below the general mean sea level at Plymouth, to 1.260\r\nft above it at Harwich, the places nearest to the mean being\r\nWeymouth (.089 ft below) and Hull (.038 ft above).\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to mention that Ordnance datum for\r\nIreland is the level of low water of spring tides in Dublin\r\nBay, which is 21 ft below a mark on the base of Poolbeg\r\nLighthouse, and 7.46 ft below English Ordnance datum.\r\n\r\nThe lines of \"high and low water mark of ordinary tides\" shown\r\nupon Ordnance maps represent mean tides; that is, tides halfway\r\nbetween the spring and the neap tides, and are generally\r\nsurveyed at the fourth tide before new and full moon. The\r\nforeshore of tidal water below \"mean high water\" belongs to the\r\nCrown, except in those cases where the rights have been waived\r\nby special grants. Mean high water is, strictly speaking, the\r\naverage height of all high waters, spring and neap, as\r\nascertained over a long period. Mean low water of ordinary\r\nspring tides is the datum generally adopted for the soundings\r\non the Admiralty Charts, although it is not universally adhered\r\nto; as, for instance, the soundings in Liverpool Bay and the river\r\nMersey are reduced to a datum 20 ft below the old dock sill, which\r\nis 125 ft below the level of low water of ordinary spring tides.\r\nThe datum of each chart varies as regards Ordnance datum, and in the\r\ncase of charts embracing a large area the datum varies along the coast.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the fall during each half-hour of the\r\ntypical tides shown in Fig, 6 (see page 15), from which it will\r\nbe seen that the maximum rate occurs at about half-tide, while\r\nvery little movement takes place during the half-hour before\r\nand the half-hour after the turn of the tide:--\r\n\r\nTable I.\r\n\r\nRate of fall of tides.\r\n\r\nState of       Eqionoctial    Ordinary      Ordinary      Lowest\r\nTide.

During the earlier part of the year the spring-tides\r\nat new moon were higher than those at full moon, but towards June\r\nthe condition became reversed. The influence of the position of the\r\nsun and moon on the height of the tide is apparent throughout,\r\nbut is particularly marked during the exceptionally low spring\r\ntides in the early part of June, when the time of new moon\r\npractically coincides with the moon in apogee and in its most\r\nnortherly position furthest removed from the equator.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the tidal waves themselves have no horizontal\r\nmotion, it is now necessary to consider by what means the\r\nmovement of water along the shores is caused. The sea is, of\r\ncourse, subject to the usual law governing the flow of water,\r\nwhereby it is constantly trying to find its own level. In a\r\ntidal wave the height of the crest is so small compared with\r\nthe length that the surface gradient from crest to trough is\r\npractically flat, and does not lead to any appreciable\r\nmovement; but as the tidal wave approaches within a few miles\r\nof the shore, it runs into shallow water, where its progress is\r\nchecked, but as it is being pushed on from behind it banks up\r\nand forms a crest of sufficient height to form a more or less\r\nsteep gradient, and to induce a horizontal movement of the\r\nparticles of water throughout the whole depth in the form of a\r\ntidal current running parallel with the shore.\r\n\r\nThe rate of this current depends upon the steepness of the\r\ngradient, and the momentum acquired will, In some Instances,\r\ncause the current to continue to run in the same direction for\r\nsome time after the tide has turned, i.e., after the direction\r\nof the gradient has been reversed; so that the tide may be\r\nmaking--or falling--in one direction, while the current is\r\nrunning the opposite way. It will be readily seen, then, that\r\nthe flow of the current will be slack about the time of high\r\nand low water, so that its maximum rate will be at half-ebb and\r\nhalf-flood. If the tide were flowing into an enclosed or semi-\r\nenclosed space, the current could not run after the tide\r\nturned, and the reversal of both would be simultaneous, unless,\r\nindeed, the current turned before the tide.\r\n\r\nWind waves are only movements of the surface of the water, and\r\ndo not generally extend for a greater depth below the trough of\r\nthe wave than the crest is above it, but as they may affect the\r\nmovement of the floating particles of sewage to a considerable\r\nextent it is necessary to record the direction and strength of\r\nthe wind.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the wind is sometimes indicated wind at the\r\ntime of making any tidal observations. By reference to the\r\nBeaufort Scale, which is a graduated classification adopted by\r\nAdmiral Beaufort about the year 1805. The following table gives\r\nthe general description, velocity, and pressure of the wind\r\ncorresponding to the tabular numbers on the scale:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III\r\n\r\nPERIOD OF SIX MONTHS.\r\n\r\nTo face page 20]\r\n\r\nThe figures indicating the pressure of the wind in the\r\nforegoing table are low compared with those given by other\r\nauthorities. From Mutton's formula, the pressure against a\r\nplane surface normal to the wind would be 0.97 lb per sq. foot,\r\nwith an average velocity of 15 miles per hour (22 ft per sec.),\r\ncompared with o.67 lb given by Admiral Beaufort, and for a\r\nvelocity of 50 miles per hour (73.3 ft per sec.) 10.75 lb,\r\ncompared with 7.7lb Semitone's formula, which is frequently\r\nused, gives the pressure as 0.005V^2 (miles per hour), so that\r\nfor 15 miles per hour velocity the pressure would be 1.125 lb,\r\nand for 50 miles it would be l2.5 lb It must not be forgotten,\r\nhowever, that, although over a period of one hour the wind may\r\n_average_ this velocity or pressure, it will vary considerably\r\nfrom moment to moment, being far in excess at one time, and\r\npractically calm at another. The velocity of the wind is\r\nusually taken by a cup anemometer having four 9 in cups on arms\r\n2 ft long. The factor for reducing the records varies from 2 to\r\n3, according to the friction and lubrication, the average being\r\n2.2.\r\n\r\nThe pressure is obtained by multiplying the Beaufort number\r\ncubed by 0.0105; and the velocity is found by multiplying the\r\nsquare root of the Beaufort number cubed by 1.87.\r\n\r\nA tidal wave will traverse the open sea in a straight line, but\r\nas it passes along the coast the progress of the line nearest\r\nthe shore is retarded while the centre part continues at the\r\nsame velocity, so that on plan the wave assumes a convex shape\r\nand the branch waves reaching the shore form an acute angle\r\nwith the coast line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCURRENT OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is considerable diversity in the design of floats\r\nemployed in current observations, dependant to some extent upon\r\nwhether it is desired to ascertain the direction of the surface\r\ndrift or of a deep current, it does not by any means follow\r\nthat they run in simultaneous directions. There is also\r\nsometimes considerable difference in the velocity of the\r\ncurrent at different depths--the surface current being more\r\nsusceptible to influence of wind. A good form of deep float is\r\nseen in Fig. 8. It consists of a rod 2 in by 2 in, or 4 sq in\r\nThe lower end of which a hollow wooden box about 6 in by 6 in\r\nis fixed, into which pebbles are placed to overcome the\r\nbuoyancy of the float and cause it to take and maintain an\r\nupright position in the water with a length of 9in of the rod\r\nexposed above the surface. A small hole is formed in the top of\r\nthe box for the insertion the pebbles, which is stopped up with\r\na cork when the float is adjusted. The length of the rod will\r\nvary according to the depth of water, but it will generally be\r\nfound convenient to employ a float about 10 ft and to have a\r\nspare one about 6 ft deep, but otherwise it is similar in all\r\nrespects, for use in shallow water. A cheap float for gauging\r\nthe surface drift can be made from an empty champagne bottle\r\nweighted with stones and partly filled with water. The top 12\r\nin of rods and the cord and neck of the bottle, as the case may\r\nbe, should be painted red, as this colour renders floats more\r\nconspicuous when in the water and gives considerable assistance\r\nin locating their position, especially when they are at some\r\ndistance from the observer.\r\n\r\nA deep-sea float designed by Mr. G. P. Bidden for ascertaining\r\nthe set of the currents along the base of the ocean has\r\nrecently been used by the North Sea Fisheries Investigation\r\nCommittee. It consists of a bottle shaped like a soda-water bottle,\r\nmade of strong glass to resist the pressure of the water, and\r\npartly filled with water, so that just sufficient air is left\r\nin it to cause it to float. A length of copper wire heavy enough\r\nto cause it to sink is then attached to the bottle, which is then\r\ndropped into the sea at a defined place. When the end of the wire\r\ntouches the bottom the bottle is relieved of some of its weight\r\nand travels along with the currents a short distance above the bed\r\nof the sea. About 20 per cent. of the bottles were recovered, either\r\nby being thrown up on the beach or by being fished up in trawl nets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--DETAIL OF WOOD TIDAL FLOAT 10 FEET\r\nDEEP.]\r\n\r\nA double float, weighing about 10 lb complete, was used for the\r\ntidal observations for the Girdleness outfall sewer, Aberdeen.\r\nThe surface portion consisted of two sheet-iron cups soldered\r\ntogether, making a float 9 in in diameter and 6 in deep. The\r\nlower or submerged portion was made of zinc, cylindrical in\r\nshape, 16 in diameter and 16 in long, perforated at intervals\r\nwith lin diameter holes and suspended by means of a brass chain\r\nfrom a swivel formed on the underside of the surface float.\r\n\r\nIn gauging the currents the float is placed in the water at a\r\ndefined point and allowed to drift, its course being noted and\r\nafterwards transferred to a plan. The time of starting should\r\nbe recorded and observations of its exact position taken\r\nregularly at every quarter of an hour, so that the time taken\r\nin covering any particular distance is known and the length of\r\ntravel during any quarter-hour period multiplied by four gives\r\nthe speed of the current at that time in miles per hour.\r\n\r\nThe method to be employed in ascertaining the exact position of\r\nthe float from time to time is a matter which requires careful\r\nconsideration, and is dependent upon the degree of accuracy\r\nrequired according to the importance of the scheme and the\r\nsituation of neighbouring towns, frequented shores, oyster\r\nbeds, and other circumstances likely to be injuriously affected\r\nby any possible or probable pollution by sewage.\r\n\r\nOne method is to follow the float in a small boat carrying a\r\nmarine compass which has the card balanced to remain in a\r\nhorizontal position, irrespective of the tipping and rolling of\r\nthe boat, and to observe simultaneously the bearing of two\r\nprominent landmarks, the position of which on the plan is\r\nknown, at each of the quarter-hour periods at which the\r\nobservations are to be taken. This method only gives very\r\napproximate results, and after checking the value of the\r\nobservations made by its use, with contemporary observations\r\ntaken by means of theodolites on the shore, the writer\r\nabandoned the system in favour of the theodolite method, which,\r\nhowever, requires a larger staff, and is therefore more\r\nexpensive. In every case it is necessary to employ a boat to\r\nfollow the float, not only so as to recover it at the end of\r\neach day's work, but principally to assist in approximately\r\nlocating the float, which can then be found more readily when\r\nsearching through the telescope of the theodolite. The boat\r\nshould be kept about 10 ft to 20 ft from the float on the side\r\nfurther removed from the observers, except when surface floats\r\nare being used to ascertain the effect of the wind, when the\r\nboat should be kept to leeward of the float. Although obviously\r\nwith a large boat the observations can be pursued through\r\nrougher weather, which is an important point, still the\r\ndifficulty of maintaining a large boat propelled by mechanical\r\npower, or sail, sufficiently near the float to assist the\r\nobservers, prevents its use, and the best result will be\r\nobtained by employing a substantial, seaworthy rowing boat with\r\na broad beam. The boatmen appreciate the inclusion of a mast,\r\nsails, and plenty of ballast in the equipment to facilitate\r\ntheir return home when the day's work is done, which may happen\r\neight or nine miles away, with twilight fast passing into\r\ndarkness. There should be two boatmen, or a man and a strong\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nIn working with theodolites, it is as well before starting to\r\nselect observation stations at intervals along the coast, drive\r\npegs in the ground so that they can easily be found afterwards,\r\nand fix their position upon a 1/2500 ordnance map in the usual\r\nmanner. It may, however, be found in practice that after\r\nleaving one station it is not possible to reach the next one\r\nbefore the time arrives for another sight to be taken. In this\r\ncase the theodolite must be set up on magnetic north at an\r\nintermediate position, and sights taken to at least two\r\nlandmarks, the positions of which are shown on the map, and the\r\npoint of observation subsequently plotted as near as possible\r\nby the use of these readings. Inasmuch as the sights will be\r\ntaken from points on the edge of the shore, which is, of\r\ncourse, shown on the map, it is possible, after setting up to\r\nmagnetic north, to fix the position with approximate accuracy\r\nby a sight to one landmark only, but this should only be done\r\nin exceptional circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe method of taking the observations with two theodolites, as\r\nadopted by the writer, can best be explained by a reference to\r\nFig. 9, which represents an indented piece of the coast. The\r\nend of the proposed sea outfall sewer, from which point the\r\nobservations would naturally start, is marked 1, the numerals\r\n2, 3, 4, etc., indicating the positions of the float as\r\nobserved from time to time. Many intermediate observations\r\nwould be taken, but in order to render the diagram more clear,\r\nthese have not been shown. The lines of sight are marked 1A,\r\n1B, etc. The points marked A1, A2, etc., indicate the first,\r\nsecond, etc., and subsequent positions of observer A; the\r\npoints B1, B2, etc., referring to observer B. The dot-and-dash\r\nline shows the course taken by the float, which is ascertained\r\nafter plotting the various observations recorded.\r\n\r\nIt is very desirable to have a horse and trap in waiting to\r\nmove the observers and their instruments from place to place as\r\nrequired, and each observer should be provided with small flags\r\nabout 2 ft square, one white and one blue, for signalling\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe instruments are first set up at A1 and B1 respectively, and\r\nadjusted to read on to the predetermined point 1 where the\r\nfloat is to be put in Then as soon as the boatmen have reached\r\nthe vicinity of this point, the observers can, by means of the\r\nflags, direct them which way to row so as to bring the boat to\r\nthe exact position required, and when this is done the anchor is\r\ndropped until it is time to start, which is signalled by the observers\r\nholding the flags straight above their heads. This is also the\r\nsignal used to indicate to the men that the day's work is\r\nfinished, and they can pick up the float and start for home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--PLAN OF INDENTED COAST-LINE LLUSTRATING\r\nMETHOD OF TAKING CURRENT OBSERVATIONS WITH TWO THEODOLITES.]\r\n\r\nDirectly the float is put in the water, and at every even\r\nquarter of an hour afterwards, each observer takes a reading of\r\nits exact position, and notes the time. As soon as the readings\r\nare taken to the float in position 2, the observer A should\r\ntake up his instrument and drive to A2, where he must set up\r\nready to take reading 3 a quarter of an hour after reading 2.\r\nIt will be noticed that he might possibly have been able to\r\ntake the reading 3 from the position A1, but the angle made by\r\nthe lines of sight from the two instruments would have been too\r\nacute for accurate work, and very probably the float would have\r\nbeen hidden by the headland, so that he could not take the\r\nreading at all. In order to be on the headland A4 at the proper\r\ntime, A must be working towards it by getting to position A3 by\r\nthe time reading 4 is due. Although the remainder of the course\r\nof the float can be followed from B1 and A4, the instruments\r\nwould be reading too much in the same line, so that B must move\r\nto B2 and then after reading 5 and 6 he should move to B3. As\r\nthe float returns towards the starting point, A can remain in\r\nthe position A4 while B goes to B4 and then moves back along\r\nthe shore as the float progresses.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing description is sufficient to indicate the general\r\nmethod of working, but the details will of course vary\r\naccording to the configuration of the shore and the course\r\ntaken by the float. Good judgment is necessary in deciding when\r\nto move from one station to the next, and celerity in setting\r\nup, adjusting the instrument, and taking readings is essential.\r\nIf the boatmen can be relied upon to keep their position near\r\nthe float, very long sights can be taken with sufficient\r\naccuracy by observing the position of the boat, long after the\r\nfloat has ceased to be visible through the telescope.\r\n\r\nThe lines of sight from each station should be subsequently\r\nplotted on the 1/2500 ordnance map; the intersection of each\r\ntwo corresponding sight lines giving the position of the float\r\nat that time. Then if a continuous line is drawn passing\r\nthrough all the points of intersection it will indicate the\r\ncourse taken by the float.\r\n\r\nIt is very desirable that the observers should be able to\r\nconvey information to each other by signalling with the flags\r\naccording to the Morse code, as follows. The dashes represent a\r\nmovement of the flag from a position in front of the left\r\nshoulder to near the ground on the right side and the dots a\r\nmovement from the left shoulder to the right shoulder.\r\n\r\nTABLE 3.\r\n\r\nMORSE ALPHABET.\r\n\r\nE  .\r\nA  .-\r\nR  .-.\r\nL  .-..\r\nW  .--\r\nP  .--.\r\nJ  .---\r\nI  ..\r\nU  ..-\r\nF  ..-.\r\nS  ...\r\nV  ...-\r\nH  ....\r\nT  -\r\nN  -.\r\nK  -.-\r\nC  -.-.\r\nY  -.--\r\nD -..\r\nX  -..-\r\nB  -...\r\nM  --\r\nG  --.\r\nQ  --.-\r\nZ  --..\r\nO  ---\r\n\r\nThe signal to attract attention at starting and to signify the\r\nend of the message is  .. .. .. continued until it is\r\nacknowledged with a similar sign by the other observer; that\r\nfor a repetition is .. -- .. which is signalled when any part\r\nof the message is not understood, otherwise after each word is\r\nsignalled the receiver waves - to indicate he understands it.\r\nUntil proficiency is attained, two copies of the alphabet\r\nshould be kept by each observer for reference, one for\r\ndispatching a message arranged in alphabetical order and the\r\nother far reading a message arranged as set out above.

As the crest of the tidal wave passes\r\nthe mouth of the river a branch wave is sent up the river. This\r\nwave has first to overcome the water flowing down the river,\r\nwhich is acting in opposition to it, and in so doing causes a\r\nbanking up of the water to such a height that the inclination\r\nof the surface is reversed to an extent sufficient to cause a\r\ntidal current to run up the river. The momentum acquired by the\r\nwater passing up-stream carries it to a higher level towards\r\nthe head of the river than at the mouth, and, similarly, in\r\nreturning, the water flowing down the river gains sufficient\r\nimpetus to scoop out the water at the mouth and form a low\r\nwater below that in the sea adjoining. Owing to a flow of\r\nupland water down a river the ebb lasts longer than the flood\r\ntide by a period, increasing in length as the distance from the\r\nmouth of the river increases; and, similarly to the sea, the\r\ncurrent may continue to run down a river after the tide has\r\nturned and the level of the water is rising. The momentum of\r\nthe tide running up the centre of the river is in excess of\r\nthat along the banks, so that the current changes near the\r\nshore before it does in the middle, and, as the sea water is of\r\ngreater specific gravity than the fresh, weighing 64 lb per\r\ncubic foot against 62-1/2 lb, it flows up the bed of the river\r\nat the commencement of the tide, while the fresh water on the\r\nsurface is running in the opposite direction. After a time the\r\nsalt water becomes diffused in the fresh, so that the density\r\nof the water in a river decreases as the distance from the sea\r\nincreases. The disposal of sewage discharged into a river is\r\ndue primarily to the mixing action which is taking place;\r\ninasmuch as the tidal current which is the transporting agent\r\nrarely flows more rapidly than from two to four miles per hour,\r\nor, say, twelve to fifteen miles per tide. The extent to which\r\nthe suspended matter is carried back again up stream when the\r\ncurrent turns depends upon the quantity of upland water which\r\nhas flowed into the upper tidal part of the river during the\r\nebb tide, as this water occupies a certain amount of space,\r\naccording to the depth and width of the river, and thus\r\nprevents the sea water flowing back to the position it occupied\r\non the previous tide, and carrying with it the matter in\r\nsuspension. The permanent seaward movement of sewage discharged\r\ninto the Thames at Barking when there is only a small quantity\r\nof upland water is at the rate of about one mile per day,\r\ntaking thirty days to travel the thirty-one miles to the sea,\r\nwhile at the mouth of the river the rate does not exceed one-\r\nthird of a mile per day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF SITE FOR OUTFALL SEWER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe selection of the site for the sea outfall sewer is a matter\r\nrequiring a most careful consideration of the many factors\r\nbearing on the point, and the permanent success of any scheme\r\nof sewage disposal depends primarily upon the skill shown in\r\nthis matter. The first step is to obtain a general idea of the\r\ntidal conditions, and to examine the Admiralty charts of the\r\nlocality, which will show the general set of the main currents\r\ninto which it is desirable the sewage should get as quickly as\r\npossible. The main currents may be at some considerable\r\ndistance from the shore, especially if the town is situated in\r\na bay, when the main current will probably be found running\r\nacross the mouth of it from headland to headland. The sea\r\noutfall should not be in the vicinity of the bathing grounds,\r\nthe pier, or parts of the shore where visitors mostly\r\ncongregate; it should not be near oyster beds or lobster\r\ngrounds. The prosperity--in fact, the very existence--of most\r\nseaside towns depends upon their capability of attracting\r\nvisitors, whose susceptibilities must be studied before\r\neconomic or engineering questions, and there are always\r\nsentimental objections to sewage works, however well designed\r\nand conducted they may be.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable that the sea outfall should be buried in the\r\nshore for the greater part of its length, not only on account\r\nof these sentimental feelings, but as a protection from the\r\nforce of the waves, and so that it should not interfere with\r\nboating; and, further, where any part of the outfall between\r\nhigh and low water mark is above the shore, scouring of the\r\nbeach will inevitably take place on each side of it. The\r\nextreme end of the outfall should be below low-water mark of\r\nequinoctial tides, as it is very objectionable to have sewage\r\nrunning across the beach from the pipe to the water, and if the\r\nfoul matter is deposited at the edge of the water it will\r\nprobably be brought inland by the rising tide. Several possible\r\npositions may present themselves for the sea outfall, and a few\r\ntrial current observations should be made in these localities\r\nat various states of the tides and plotted on to a 1:2500\r\nordnance map. The results of these observations will probably\r\nreduce the choice of sites very considerably.\r\n\r\nLevels should be taken of the existing subsidiary sewers in the\r\ntown, or, if there are none, the proposed arrangement of\r\ninternal sewers should be sketched out with a view to their\r\ndischarging their contents at one or other of the points under\r\nconsideration. It may be that the levels of the sewers are such\r\nthat by the time they reach the shore they are below the level\r\nof low water, when, obviously, pumping or other methods of\r\nraising the sewage must be resorted to; if they are above low\r\nwater, but below high water, the sewage could be stored during\r\nhigh water and run off at or near low water; or, if they are\r\nabove high water, the sewage could run off continuously, or at\r\nany particular time that might be decided.\r\n\r\nObservations of the currents should now be made from the\r\nselected points, giving special attention to those periods\r\nduring which it is possible to discharge the sewage having\r\nregard to the levels of the sewers. These should be made with\r\nthe greatest care and accuracy, as the final selection of the\r\ntype of scheme to be adopted will depend very largely on the\r\nresults obtained and the proper interpretation of them, by\r\nestimating, and mentally eliminating, any disturbing\r\ninfluences, such as wind, etc. Care must also be taken in\r\nnoting the height of the tide and the relative positions of the\r\nsun, moon, and earth at the time of making the observations,\r\nand in estimating from such information the extent to which the\r\ntides and currents may vary at other times when those bodies\r\nare differently situated.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that if the levels of the sewers and other\r\ncircumstances are such that the sewage can safely be discharged\r\nat low water, and the works are to be constructed accordingly,\r\nit is most important to have accurate information as to the\r\nlevel of the highest low water which may occur in any ordinary\r\ncircumstances. If the level of a single low water, given by a\r\ncasual observation, is adopted without consideration of the\r\ngoverning conditions, it may easily be that the tide in\r\nquestion is a low one, that may not be repeated for several\r\nyears, and the result would be that, instead of having a free\r\noutlet at low water, the pipe would generally be submerged, and\r\nits discharging capacity very greatly reduced.\r\n\r\nThe run of the currents will probably differ at each of the\r\npoints under consideration, so that if one point were selected\r\nthe best result would be obtained by discharging the sewage at\r\nhigh water and at another point at low water, whereas at a\r\nthird point the results would show that to discharge there\r\nwould not be satisfactory at any stage of the tide unless the\r\nsewage were first partially or even wholly purified. If these\r\nresults are considered in conjunction with the levels of the\r\nsewers definite alternative schemes, each of which would work\r\nsatisfactory may be evolved, and after settling them in rough\r\noutline, comparative approximate estimates should be prepared,\r\nwhen a final scheme may be decided upon which, while giving the\r\nmost efficient result at the minimum cost, will not arouse\r\nsentimental objections to a greater extent than is inherent to\r\nall schemes of sewage disposal.\r\n\r\nHaving thus selected the exact position of the outfall, the\r\ncurrent observations from that point should be completed, so\r\nthat the engineer may be in a position to state definitely the\r\ncourse which would be taken by sewage if discharged under any\r\nconditions of time or tide. This information is not\r\nparticularly wanted by the engineer, but the scheme will have\r\nto receive the sanction of the Local Government Board or of\r\nParliament, and probably considerable opposition will be raised\r\nby interested parties, which must be met at all points and\r\novercome. In addition to this, it may be possible, and\r\nnecessary, when heavy rain occurs, to allow the diluted sewage\r\nto escape into the sea at any stage of the tide; and, while it\r\nis easy to contend that it will not then be more impure than\r\nstorm water which is permitted to be discharged into inland\r\nstreams during heavy rainfall, the aforesaid sentimentalists\r\nmay conjure up many possibilities of serious results. As far as\r\npossible the records should indicate the course taken by floats\r\nstarting from the outfall, at high water, and at each regular\r\nhour afterwards on the ebb tide, as well as at low water and\r\nevery hour on the flood tide. It is not, however, by any means\r\nnecessary that they should be taken in this or any particular\r\norder, because as the height of the tide varies each day an\r\nobservation taken at high water one day is not directly\r\ncomparable with one taken an hour after high water the next\r\nday, and while perhaps relatively the greatest amount of\r\ninformation can be gleaned from a series of observations taken\r\nat the same state of the tide, but on tides of differing\r\nheights, still, every observation tells its own story and\r\nserves a useful purpose.\r\n\r\nDeep floats and surface floats should be used concurrently to\r\nshow the effect of the wind, the direction and force of which\r\nshould be noted. If it appears that with an on-shore wind\r\nfloating particles would drift to the shore, screening will be\r\nnecessary before the sewage is discharged. The floats should be\r\nfollowed as long as possible, but at least until the turn of\r\nthe current--that is to say, a float put in at or near high\r\nwater should be followed until the current has turned at or\r\nnear low water, and one put in at low water should be followed\r\nuntil after high water. In all references to low water the\r\nheight of the tide given is that of the preceding high water.\r\n\r\nThe time at which the current turns relative to high and low\r\nwater at any place will be found to vary with the height of the\r\ntide, and all the information obtained on this point should be\r\nplotted on squared paper as shown on Fig. 10, which represents\r\nthe result of observations taken near the estuary of a large\r\nriver where the conditions would be somewhat different from\r\nthose holding in the open sea. The vertical lines represent the\r\ntime before high or low water at which the current turned, and\r\nthe horizontal lines the height of the tide, but the data will,\r\nof course, vary in different localities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hours before turn of tide. FIG 10]\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that certain of the points thus obtained can\r\nbe joined up by a regular curve which can be utilised for\r\nascertaining the probable time at which the current will turn\r\non tides of height intermediate to those at which observations\r\nwere actually taken. For instance, from the diagram given it\r\ncan be seen that on a 20 ft tide the current will turn thirty\r\nminutes before the tide, or on a 15 ft tide the current will\r\nturn one hour before the tide. Some of the points lie at a\r\nconsiderable distance from the regular curve, showing that the\r\ncurrents on those occasions were affected by some disturbing\r\ninfluence which the observer will probably be able to explain\r\nby a reference to his notes, and therefore those particular\r\nobservations must be used with caution.\r\n\r\nThe rate of travel of the currents varies in accordance with\r\nthe time they have been running. Directly after the turn there\r\nis scarcely any movement, but the speed increases until it\r\nreaches a maximum about three hours later and then it decreases\r\nuntil the next turn, when dead water occurs again.\r\n\r\nThose observations which were started at the turn of the\r\ncurrent and continued through the whole tide should be plotted\r\nas shown in Fig. 11, which gives the curves relating to three\r\ndifferent tides, but, provided a sufficiently large scale is\r\nadopted, there is no reason why curves relating to the whole\r\nrange of the tides should not be plotted on one diagram. This\r\nchart shows the total distance that would be covered by a float\r\naccording to the height of the tide; it also indicates the\r\nvelocity of the current from time to time. It can be used in\r\nseveral ways, but as this necessitates the assumption that with\r\ntides of the same height the flow of the currents is absolutely\r\nidentical along the coast in the vicinity of the outfall, the\r\ndiagram should be checked as far as possible by any\r\nobservations that may be taken at other states of tides of the\r\nsame heights. Suppose we require to know how far a float will\r\ntravel if started at two hours after high water on a 12 ft\r\ntide. From Fig. 10 we see that on a tide of this height the\r\ncurrent turns two hours and a quarter before the tide;\r\ntherefore two hours after high water will be four hours and a\r\nquarter after the turn of the current. If the float were\r\nstarted with the current, we see from Fig. 11 that it would\r\nhave travelled three miles in four hours and a quarter; and\r\nsubtracting this from four miles, which is its full travel on a\r\nwhole tide, we see that it will only cover one mile in the two\r\nhours and a quarter remaining before the current turns to run\r\nback again.\r\n\r\nAlthough sewage discharged into the sea rapidly becomes so\r\ndiffused as to lose its identity, still occasionally the\r\nextraneous substances in it, such as wooden matches, banana\r\nskins, etc., may be traced for a considerable distance; so\r\nthat, as the sewage continues to be discharged into the sea\r\nmoving past the outfall, there is formed what may be described\r\nas a body or column of water having possibilities of sewage\r\ncontamination. If the time during which sewage is discharged is\r\nlimited to two hours, and starts, say, at the turn of the\r\ncurrent on a 12 ft tide, we see from Fig. 11 that the front of\r\nthis body of water will have reached a point five-eighths of a\r\nmile away when the discharge ceases; so that there will be a\r\nvirtual column of water of a total length of five-eighths of a\r\nmile, in which is contained all that remains of the noxious\r\nmatters, travelling through the sea along the course of the\r\ncurrent. We see, further, that at a distance of three miles\r\naway this column would only take thirty minutes to pass a given\r\npoint. The extent of this column of water will vary\r\nconsiderably according to the tide and the time of discharge;\r\nfor instance, on a 22 ft tide, if the discharge starts one hour\r\nafter the turn of the current and continues for two hours, as\r\nin the previous example, it will form a column four miles long,\r\nwhereas if it started two hours after the current, and\r\ncontinued for the same length of time, the column would be six\r\nmiles and a half long, but the percentage of sewage in the\r\nwater would be infinitesimal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hours after turn of current FIG. 11]\r\n\r\nIn some cases it may be essential that the sewage should be\r\nborne past a certain point before the current turns in order to\r\nensure that it shall not be brought back on the return tide to\r\nthe shore near the starting point. In other words, the sewage\r\ntravelling along the line of a branch current must reach the\r\njunction on the line of the main current by a certain time in\r\norder to catch the connection. Assuming the period of discharge\r\nwill be two hours, and that the point which it is necessary to\r\nclear is situated three miles and a half from the outfall, the\r\npermissible time to discharge the sewage according to the\r\nheight of the tide can be obtained from Fig. 11. Taking the 22\r\nft tide first, it will be seen that if the float started with\r\nthe current it would travel twelve miles in the tide; three and\r\na half from twelve leaves eight and a half miles. A vertical line\r\ndropped from the intersection of the eight miles and a half line\r\nwith the curve of the current gives the time two hours and a half\r\nbefore the end, or four hours after the start of the current at which\r\nthe discharge of the sewage must cease at the outfall in order that\r\nthe rear part of the column can reach the required point before\r\nthe current turns. As on this tide high water is about fifteen\r\nminutes after the current, the latest time for the two hours of\r\ndischarge must be from one hour and three-quarters to three\r\nhours and three-quarters after high water. Similarly with the\r\n12 ft tide having a total travel of four miles: three and a\r\nhalf from four leaves half a mile, and a vertical line from the\r\nhalf-mile intersection gives one hour and three-quarters after\r\nthe start of the current as the time for discharge to cease.\r\nHigh water is two hours and a quarter after the current;\r\ntherefore the latest time for the period of discharge would be\r\nfrom two hours and a half to half an hour before high water,\r\nbut, as during the first quarter of an hour the movement of the\r\ncurrent, though slight, would be in the opposite direction, it\r\nwould be advisable to curtail the time of discharge, and say\r\nthat it should be limited to between two hours and a quarter\r\nand half an hour before high water. It is obvious that if\r\nsewage is discharged about two hours after high water the\r\ncurrent will be nearing its maximum speed, but it will only\r\nhave about three hours to run before it turns; so that,\r\nalthough the sewage may be removed with the maximum rapidity\r\nfrom the vicinity of the sea outfall, it will not be carried to\r\nany very great distance, and, of course, the greater the\r\ndistance it is carried the more it will be diffused. It must be\r\nremembered that the foregoing data are only applicable to the\r\nlocality they relate to, although after obtaining the necessary\r\ninformation similar diagrams can be made and used for other\r\nplaces; but enough has been said to show that when it is\r\nnecessary to utilise the full effect of the currents the sewage\r\nshould be discharged at a varying time before high or low\r\nwater, as the case may be, according to the height of the tide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nVOLUME OF SEWAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe total quantity of sewage to be dealt with per day can be\r\nascertained by gauging the flow in those cases where the sewers\r\nare already constructed, but where the scheme is an entirely\r\nnew one the quantity must be estimated. If there is a water\r\nsupply system the amount of water consumed per day, after\r\nmaking due allowance for the quantity used for trade purposes\r\nand street watering, will be a useful guide. The average amount\r\nof water used per head per day for domestic purposes only may\r\nbe taken as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\nDAILY WATER SUPPLY\r\n(Gallons per head per day.)\r\n\r\nDietetic purposes (cooking, drinking, &c.)    1\r\nCleansing purposes (washing house utensils,\r\nclothes, &c.)                                 6\r\n\r\nIf water-closets are in general use, add      3\r\n\r\nIf baths are in general use, add              5\r\n\r\nTotal                                        15\r\n\r\nIt therefore follows that the quantity of domestic sewage to be\r\nexpected will vary from 7 to 15 gallons per head per day,\r\naccording to the extent of the sanitary conveniences installed\r\nin the town; but with the advent of an up-to-date sewage\r\nscheme, probably accompanied by a proper water supply, a very\r\nlarge increase in the number of water-closets and baths may\r\nconfidently be anticipated, and it will rarely be advisable to\r\nprovide for a less quantity of domestic sewage than 15 gallons\r\nper head per day for each of the resident inhabitants. The\r\nproblem is complicated in sea coast towns by the large influx\r\nof visitors during certain short periods of the year, for whom\r\nthe sewerage system must be sufficient, and yet it must not be\r\nso large compared with the requirements of the residential\r\npopulation that it cannot be kept in an efficient state during\r\nthat part of the year when the visitors are absent. The\r\nvisitors are of two types--the daily trippers and those who\r\nspend several days or weeks in the town. The daily tripper may\r\nnot directly contribute much sewage to the sewers, but he does\r\nindirectly through those who cater for his wants. The resident\r\nvisitor will spend most of the day out of doors, and therefore\r\ncause less than the average quantity of water to be used for\r\nhouse-cleansing purposes, in addition to which the bulk of the\r\nsoiled linen will not be washed in the town. An allowance of 10\r\ngallons per head per day for the resident visitor and 5 gallons\r\nper head per day for the trippers will usually be found a\r\nsufficient provision.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, well known that the flow of sewage varies\r\nfrom day to day as well as from hour to hour, and while there\r\nis no necessity to consider the daily variation--calculations\r\nbeing based on the flow of the maximum day--the hourly\r\nvariation plays a most important part where storage of the\r\nsewage for any length of time is an integral part of the\r\nscheme. There are many important factors governing this\r\nvariation, and even if the most elaborate calculations are made\r\nthey are liable to be upset at any time by the unexpected\r\ndischarge of large quantities of trade wastes. With a small\r\npopulation the hourly fluctuation in the quantity of sewage\r\nflowing into the sewers is very great, but it reduces as the\r\npopulation increases, owing to the diversity of the occupations\r\nand habits of the inhabitants. In all cases where the\r\nresidential portions of the district are straggling, and the\r\noutfall works are situated at a long distance from the centre\r\nof the town, the flow becomes steadier, and the inequalities\r\nare not so prominently marked at the outlet end of the sewer.\r\nThe rate of flow increases more or less gradually to the\r\nmaximum about midday, and falls off in the afternoon in the\r\nsame gradual manner. The following table, based on numerous\r\ngaugings, represents approximately the hourly variations in the\r\ndry weather flow of the sewage proper from populations\r\nnumbering from 1,000 to 10,000, and is prepared after deducting\r\nall water which may be present in the sewers resulting from the\r\ninfiltration of subsoil water through leaky joints in the\r\npipes, and from defective water supply fittings as ascertained\r\nfrom the night gaugings. Larger towns have not been included in\r\nthe table because the hourly rates of flow are generally\r\ncomplicated by the discharge of the trade wastes previously\r\nreferred to, which must be the subject of special investigation\r\nin each case.\r\n\r\n\r\n[TABLE NO. 4.\r\n\r\nAPPROXIMATE HOURLY VARIATION IN THE FLOW OF SEWAGE.\r\nPercentage of Total Flow Passing Off in each Hour.\r\n\r\n-----------+------------------------------------------------\r\n           |                   Population.\r\n    Hour.  +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+------\r\n           |1,000|2,000|3,000|4,000|5,000|6,000|8,000|10,000\r\n-----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+------\r\n Midnight  | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.2 | 1.3 | 1.5 | 1.5 | 1.8 | 2.0\r\n  1.0 a.m. | 0.7 | 0.7 | 0.7 | 0.8 | 0.8 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0\r\n  2.0  \"   | nil | nil | nil | nil | 0.2 | 0.2 | 0.3 | 0.5\r\n  3.0  \"   | nil | nil | nil | nil | nil | nil | nil | 0.2\r\n  4.0  \"   | nil | nil | nil | nil | nil | nil | nil | nil\r\n  5.0  \"   | nil | nil | nil | nil | nil | nil | nil | 0.2\r\n  6.0  \"   | 0.2 | 0.2 | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.6 | 0.5 | 0.7 | 0.8\r\n  7.0  \"   | 0.5 | 0.5 | 1.0 | 1.5 | 1.6 | 1.7 | 2.0 | 2.5\r\n  8.0  \"   | 1.0 | 1.5 | 2.0 | 2.5 | 3.0 | 3.5 | 4.0 | 5.0\r\n  9.0  \"   | 3.5 | 4.5 | 4.5 | 4.8 | 5.5 | 5.8 | 6.0 | 6.5\r\n 10.0  \"   | 6.5 | 6.5 | 6.8 | 7.0 | 7.5 | 7.7 | 8.0 | 8.0\r\n 11.0  \"   |10.5 |11.0 |10.5 |10.0 | 9.6 | 9.3 | 9.0 | 8.8\r\n Noon      |11.0 |11.3 |10.8 |10.3 | 9.3 | 9.5 | 9.2 | 9.0\r\n  1.0 p.m. | 6.0 | 5.5 | 6.0 | 6.7 | 7.0 | 7.2 | 7.3 | 7.5\r\n  2.0  \"   | 7.0 | 7.3 | 7.0 | 7.0 | 6.5 | 6.5 | 6.2 | 6.0\r\n  3.0  \"   | 6.8 | 6.5 | 6.5 | 6.5 | 6.5 | 6.3 | 6.3 | 6.0\r\n  4.0  \"   | 7.5 | 7.5 | 7.3 | 7.0 | 6.7 | 6.5 | 6.2 | 6.7\r\n  5.0  \"   | 6.5 | 6.5 | 6.5 | 6.3 | 6.0 | 6.0 | 6.0 | 5.8\r\n  6.0  \"   | 4.5 | 4.5 | 4.7 | 4.8 | 5.0 | 5.0 | 5.0 | 5.2\r\n  7.0  \"   | 6.5 | 6.2 | 6.0 | 5.8 | 5.5 | 5.5 | 5.5 | 4.7\r\n  8.0  \"   | 6.2 | 6.0 | 5.8 | 5.5 | 5.5 | 5.3 | 5.0 | 4.8\r\n  9.0  \"   | 5.0 | 4.8 | 4.7 | 4.5 | 4.5 | 4.5 | 4.5 | 4.0\r\n 10.0  \"   | 4.8 | 4.6 | 4.2 | 4.0 | 3.8 | 3.5 | 3.0 | 3.0\r\n 11.0  \"   | 4.3 | 3.5 | 3.5 | 3.2 | 3.2 | 3.0 | 3.0 | 2.8\r\n-----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+------\r\n     Total |100.0|100.0|100.0|100.0|100.0|100.0|100.0|100.0\r\n-----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+------\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF FLOW]\r\n\r\nPercentage of total flow passing off during period named.\r\n\r\n---------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n                     |                          Population.                           |\r\n                     +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+\r\n                     | 1,000 | 2,000 | 3,000 | 4,000 | 5,000 | 6,000 | 8,000 | 10,000 |\r\n---------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+\r\n7.0 a.m. to 7.0 p.m  |  77.3 |  78.8 |  78.6 |  78.7 |  78.5 |  78.8 |  78.7 |  75.2  |\r\n7.0 p.m. to 7.0 a.m  |  22.7 |  21.2 |  21.4 |  21.3 |  21.5 |  21.2 |  21.3 |  21.8  |\r\nMaximum 12 hrs.      |  84.0 |  83.6 |  82.6 |  81.7 |  81.0 |  80.6 |  79.7 |  78.2  |\r\n    \"   10  \"        |  72.8 |  72.8 |  72.1 |  71.4 |  70.0 |  69.8 |  69.2 |  68.5  |\r\n    \"    9  \"        |  66.3 |  66.6 |  66.1 |  65.6 |  64.5 |  64.8 |  64.2 |  63.3  |\r\n    \"    8  \"        |  61.8 |  62.1 |  61.4 |  60.8 |  59.5 |  59.0 |  58.2 |  57.5  |\r\n    \"    6  \"        |  48.8 |  49.1 |  43.1 |  47.5 |  46.8 |  46.5 |  46.0 |  45.8  |\r\n    \"    3  \"        |  23.0 |  28.8 |  27.11|  27.3 |  26.8 |  26.5 |  26.2 |  25.8  |\r\n    \"    2  \"        |  21.5 |  22.3 |  21.3 |  20.3 |  19.3 |  18.5 |  18.2 |  17.3  |\r\n    \"    1  \"        |  11.0 |  11.3 |  10.8 |  10.3 |   9.8 |   9.5 |   9.2 |  9.0   |\r\nMinimum  9  \"        |   3.4 |   3.9 |   5.2 |   6.6 |   7.5 |   6.9 |   8.8 |  10.0  |\r\n    \"   10  \"        |   6.9 |   7.4 |   8.7 |   9.8 |  10.7 |  10.4 |  11.8 |  13.0  |\r\n---------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+\r\n\r\nThe data in the foregoing table, so far as they relate to\r\npopulations of one, five, and ten thousand respectively, are\r\nreproduced graphically in Fig. 12.\r\n\r\nThis table and diagram relate only to the flow of sewage--that\r\nis, water which is intentionally fouled; but unfortunately it\r\nis almost invariably found that the flow in the sewers is\r\ngreater than is thus indicated, and due allowance must be made\r\naccordingly. The greater the amount of extra liquid flowing in\r\nthe sewers as a permanent constant stream, the less marked will\r\nbe the hourly variations; and in one set of gaugings which came\r\nunder the writer's notice the quantity of extraneous liquid in\r\nthe sewers was so greatly in excess of the ordinary sewage flow\r\nthat, taken as a percentage of the total daily flow, the hourly\r\nvariation was almost imperceptible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 12 Hourly Variation in Flow of Sewage.]\r\n\r\nProvision must be made in the scheme for the leakage from the\r\nwater fittings, and for the subsoil water, which will\r\ninevitably find its way into the sewers. The quantity will vary\r\nvery considerably, and is difficult of estimation. If the water\r\nis cheap, and the supply plentiful, the water authority may not\r\nseriously attempt to curtail the leakage; but in other cases it\r\nwill be reduced to a minimum by frequent house to house\r\ninspection; some authorities going so far as to gratuitously\r\nfix new washers to taps when they are required. Theoretically,\r\nthere should be no infiltration of subsoil water, as in nearly\r\nall modern sewerage schemes the pipes are tested and proved to be\r\nwatertight before the trenches are filled in; but in practice this\r\nhappy state is not obtainable. The pipes may not all be bedded as\r\nsolidly as they should be, and when the pressure of the earth comes\r\nupon them settlement takes place and the joints are broken. Joints\r\nmay also be broken by careless filling of trenches, or by men\r\nwalking upon the pipes before they are sufficiently covered.\r\nSome engineers specify that all sewers shall be tested and\r\nproved to be absolutely water-tight before they are \"passed\"\r\nand covered in, but make a proviso that if, after the\r\ncompletion of the works, the leakage into any section exceeds\r\n1/2 cubic foot per minute per mile of sewer, that length shall\r\nbe taken up and relaid. Even if the greatest vigilance is\r\nexercised to obtain water-tight sewers, the numerous house\r\nconnections are each potential sources of leakage, and when the\r\nscheme is complete there may be a large quantity of\r\ninfiltration water to be dealt with. Where there are existing\r\nsystems of old sewers the quantity of infiltration water can be\r\nascertained by gauging the night flow; and if it is proved to\r\nbe excessive, a careful examination of the course of the sewers\r\nshould be made with a view to locating the places where the\r\ngreater part of the leakage occurs, and then to take such steps\r\nas may be practicable to reduce the quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nGAUGING FLOW IN SEWERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA method frequently adopted to gauge the flow of the sewage is\r\nto fix a weir board with a single rectangular notch across the\r\nsewer in a convenient manhole, which will pond up the sewage;\r\nand then to ascertain the depth of water passing over the notch\r\nby measurements from the surface of the water to a peg fixed\r\nlevel with the bottom of the notch and at a distance of two or\r\nthree feet away on the upstream side. The extreme variation in\r\nthe flow of the sewage is so great, however, that if the notch\r\nis of a convenient width to take the maximum flow, the hourly\r\nvariation at the time of minimum flow will affect the depth of\r\nthe sewage on the notch to such a small extent that difficulty\r\nmay be experienced in taking the readings with sufficient\r\naccuracy to show such variations in the flow, and there will be\r\ngreat probability of incorrect results being obtained by reason\r\nof solid sewage matter lodging on the notch. When the depth on\r\na l2 in notch is about 6 in, a variation of only 1-16th inch in\r\nthe vertical measurement will represent a difference in the\r\nrate of the flow of approximately 405 gallons per hour, or\r\nabout 9,700 gallons per day. When the flow is about lin deep\r\nthe same variation of 1-16th in will represent about 162\r\ngallons per hour, or 3,900 gallons per day. Greater accuracy\r\nwill be obtained if a properly-formed gauging pond is\r\nconstructed independently of the manhole and a double\r\nrectangular notch, similar to Fig. 13, or a triangular or V-\r\nshaped notch, as shown in Fig. 14, used in lieu of the simpler\r\nform.\r\n\r\nIn calculating the discharge of weirs there are several formulæ\r\nto choose from, all of which will give different results,\r\nthough comparative accuracy has been claimed for each. Taking\r\nfirst a single rectangular notch and reducing the formulae to\r\nthe common form:\r\n\r\n                                          ____\r\nDischarge per foot in width of weir = C \\/ H^3\r\n\r\nwhere H = depth from the surface of still water above the weir to the level of\r\nthe bottom of the notch, the value of C will be as set out in the following\r\ntable:--\r\n\r\n  TABLE No. 5.\r\n\r\n  RECTANGULAR NOTCHES.\r\n                                                  _____\r\n       Discharge per foot in width of notch = C \\/ H^3\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                                Values of C.\r\n  --------------------------------------+---------------------------\r\n   H Measured in |        Feet.         |        Inches.\r\n  ---------------+-----------+----------+-----------+---------------\r\n                 | Gallons   |  C. ft  | Gallons   |  C. ft\r\n  Discharge in   | per hour. | per min | per hour. | per min\r\n  ---------------+-----------+----------+-----------+---------------\r\n     Authority.  |           |          |           |\r\n  Box            |   79,895  |   213.6  |    1,922  |      5.13\r\n  Cotterill      |   74,296  |   198.6  |    1,787  |      4.78\r\n  Francis        |   74,820  |   200.0  |    1,800  |      4.81\r\n  Mo'esworth     |   80,057  |   214.0  |    1,926  |      5.15\r\n  Santo Crimp    |   72,949  |   195.0  |    1,755  |      4.69\r\n  ---------------+-----------+----------+-----------+---------------\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing table Francis' short formula is used, which\r\ndoes not take into account the end contractions and therefore\r\ngives a slightly higher result than would otherwise be the\r\ncase, and in Cotterill's formula the notch is taken as being\r\nhalf the width of the weir, or of the stream above the weir. If\r\na cubic foot is taken as being equal to 6-1/4 gallons instead\r\nof 6.235 gallons, then, cubic feet per minute multiplied by\r\n9,000 equals gallons per day.

In order to make allowance for this, the head calculated\r\nto produce the velocity must be added to the actual head. This\r\ncan be embodied in the formula, as, for example, Santo Crimp's\r\nformula for discharge in cubic feet per minute, with H measured\r\nin feet, is written\r\n\r\n       __________________\r\n  195\\/(11^3 + .035V - H^2\r\n\r\ninstead of the usual form of\r\n       ____\r\n  195\\/ H^3, which is used\r\n\r\nwhen there is no velocity to take into account. The V\r\nrepresents the velocity in feet per second.\r\n\r\nTriangular or V notches are usually formed so that the angle\r\nbetween the two sides is 90°, when the breadth at any point\r\nwill always be twice the vertical height measured at the\r\ncentre. The discharge in this case varies as the square root of\r\nthe fifth power of the height instead of the third power as\r\nwith the rectangular notch. The reason for the alteration of\r\nthe power is that _approximately_ the discharge over a notch\r\nwith any given head varies as the cross-sectional area of the\r\nbody of water passing over it. The area of the 90° notch is\r\nhalf that of a circumscribing rectangular notch, so that the\r\ndischarge of a V notch is approximately equal to that of a\r\nrectangular notch having a width equal to half the width of the\r\nV notch at water level, and as the total width is equal to\r\ndouble the depth of water passing over the notch the half width\r\nis equal to the full depth and the discharge is equal to that\r\nof a rectangular notch having a width equal to the depth of\r\nwater flowing over the V notch from time to time, both being\r\nmeasured in the same unit, therefore\r\n      ____                   ____                  ____\r\n  C \\/ H^3 becomes C x H x \\/ H^3 which equals C \\/ H^5.\r\n\r\nThe constant C will, however, vary from that for the\r\nrectangular notch to give an accurate result.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE No. 6.\r\n\r\n  TRIANGULAR OR V NOTCHES.\r\n                    ____\r\n  Discharge = C x \\/ H^5.\r\n\r\n  Values of C.\r\n\r\n  --------------+-----------------------+------------------------\r\n  H Measured in |         Feet.         |        Inches.\r\n  --------------+----------+------------+-----------+------------\r\n  Discharge in  | Gallons  | C. ft per  | Gallons   | C. ft per\r\n                | per hour |    min     | per hour. |    min\r\n  --------------+----------+------------+-----------+------------\r\n  Alexander     |  59,856  |    160     |   120.0   |    0.321\r\n  Cotterill     |  57,013  |    152.4   |   114.3   |    0.306\r\n  Molesworth    |  59,201  |    158.2   |   118.7   |    0.317\r\n  Thomson       |  57,166  |    152.8   |   114.6   |    0.306\r\n  --------------+----------+------------+-----------+------------\r\n\r\n\r\nCotterill's formula for the discharge in cubic feet per minute\r\nis\r\n               _______\r\n  16 x C x B \\/ 2g H^3\r\n\r\nwhen B = breadth of notch in feet and H = height of water in\r\nfeet and can be applied to any proportion of notch.

The hook-gauge consists of a square rod of, say, lin\r\nside, with a metal hook at the bottom, as shown in Fig. 15, and\r\nis so proportioned that the distance from the top of the hook\r\nto the top of the rod is equal to the difference in level of\r\nthe top of the weir and the sill of the notch. In using it the\r\nrod of the hook-gauge is held against the side of the gauge-peg\r\nand lowered into the water until the point of the hook is\r\nsubmerged. The gauge is then gently raised until the point of\r\nthe hook breaks the surface of the water, when the distance\r\nfrom the top of the gauge-peg to the top of the rod of the\r\nhook-gauge will correspond with the depth of the water flowing\r\nover the weir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nRAINFALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next consideration is the amount of rain-water for which\r\nprovision should be made. This depends on two factors: first,\r\nthe amount of rain which may be expected to fall; and,\r\nsecondly, the proportion of this rainfall which will reach the\r\nsewers. The maximum rate at which the rain-water will reach the\r\noutfall sewer will determine the size of the sewer and capacity\r\nof the pumping plant, if any, while if the sewage is to be\r\nstored during certain periods of the tide the capacity of the\r\nreservoir will depend upon the total quantity of rain-water\r\nentering it during such periods, irrespective of the rate of\r\nflow.\r\n\r\nSome very complete and valuable investigations of the flow of\r\nrain-water in the Birmingham sewers were carried out between\r\n1900 and 1904 by Mr. D. E. Lloyd-Davies, M.Inst.C. E., the\r\nresults of which are published in Vol. CLXIV., Min Proc.\r\nInst.C.E. He showed that the quantity reaching the sewer at any\r\npoint was proportional to the time of concentration at that\r\npoint and the percentage of impermeable area in the district.\r\nThe time of concentration was arrived at by calculating the\r\ntime which the rain-water would take to flow through the\r\nlongest line of sewers from the extreme boundaries of the\r\ndistrict to the point of observation, assuming the sewers to be\r\nflowing half full; and adding to the time so obtained the\r\nperiod required for the rain to get into the sewers, which\r\nvaried from one minute where the roofs were connected directly\r\nwith the sewers to three minutes where the rain had first to\r\nflow along the road gutters. With an average velocity of 3 ft\r\nper second the time of concentration will be thirty minutes for\r\neach mile of sewer. The total volume of rain-water passing into\r\nthe sewers was found to bear the same relation to the total\r\nvolume of rain falling as the maximum flow in the sewers bore\r\nto the maximum intensity of rainfall during a period equal to\r\nthe time of concentration. He stated further that while the\r\nflow in the sewers was proportional to the aggregate rainfall\r\nduring the time of concentration, it was also directly\r\nproportional to the impermeable area. Putting this into\r\nfigures, we see that in a district where the whole area is\r\nimpermeable, if a point is taken on the main sewers which is so\r\nplaced that rain falling at the head of the branch sewer\r\nfurthest removed takes ten minutes to reach it, then the\r\nmaximum flow of storm water past that point will be\r\napproximately equal to the total quantity of rain falling over\r\nthe whole drainage area during a period of ten minutes, and\r\nfurther, that the total quantity of rainfall reaching the\r\nsewers will approximately equal the total quantity falling. If,\r\nhowever, the impermeable area is 25 per cent. of the whole,\r\nthen the maximum flow of storm water will be 25 per cent. of\r\nthe rain falling during the time of concentration, viz., ten\r\nminutes, and the total quantity of storm water will be 25 per\r\ncent. of the total rainfall.\r\n\r\nIf the quantity of storm water is gauged throughout the year it\r\nwill probably be found that, on the average, only from 70 per\r\ncent. to 80 per cent. of the rain falling on the impermeable\r\nareas will reach the sewers instead of 100 per cent., as\r\nsuggested by Mr. Lloyd-Davies, the difference being accounted\r\nfor by the rain which is required to wet the surfaces before\r\nany flow off can take place, in addition to the rain-water\r\ncollected in tanks for domestic use, rain required to fill up\r\ngullies the water level of which has been lowered by\r\nevaporation, and rain-water absorbed in the joints of the\r\npaving.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of the rainfall decreases as the period over\r\nwhich the rainfall is taken is increased. For instance, a\r\nrainfall of lin may occur in a period of twenty minutes, being\r\nat the rate of 3 in per hour, but if a period of one hour is\r\ntaken the fall during such lengthened time will be considerably\r\nless than 3 in In towns where automatic rain gauges are\r\ninstalled and records kept, the required data can be\r\nabstracted, but in other cases it is necessary to estimate the\r\nquantity of rain which may have to be dealt with.\r\n\r\nIt is impracticable to provide sewers to deal with the maximum\r\nquantity of rain which may possibly fall either in the form of\r\nwaterspouts or abnormally heavy torrential rains, and the\r\namount of risk which it is desirable to run must be settled\r\nafter consideration of the details of each particular case. The\r\nfollowing table, based principally upon observations taken at\r\nthe Birmingham Observatory, shows the approximate rainfall\r\nwhich may be taken according to the time of concentration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE No. 7.\r\n\r\nINTENSITY OF RAINFALL DURING LIMITED PERIODS.\r\n                             Equivalent rate in inches per hour\r\n                             of aggregate rainfall during\r\nTime of Concentration,       period of concentration\r\n                             A     B     C     D     E\r\n 5 minutes  ...............  1.75  2.00  3.00  --    --\r\n10   \"      ...............  1.25  1.50  2.00  --    --\r\n15   \"      ...............  1.05  1.25  1.50  --    --\r\n20   \"      ...............  0.95  1.05  1.30  1.20  3.00\r\n25   \"      ...............  0.85  0.95  1.15  --    --\r\n30   \"      ...............  0.80  0.90  1.05  1.00  2.50\r\n35   \"      ...............  0.75  0.85  0.95  --    --\r\n40   \"      ...............  0.70  0.80  0.90  --    --\r\n45   \"      ...............  0.65  0.75  0.85  --    --\r\n 1 hour  ..................  0.50  0.60  0.70  0.75  1.80\r\n 1-1/2 \" ..................  0.40  0.50  0.60  --    1.40\r\n 2   \"   ..................  0.30  0.40  0.50  0.50  1.10\r\n\r\n\r\nThe figures in column A will not probably be exceeded more than\r\nonce in each year, those in column B will not probably be\r\nexceeded more than once in three years, while those in column C\r\nwill rarely be exceeded at all.

It\r\nis found that on the average the whole of the rain on a rainy\r\nday falls within a period of 2-1/2 hours; therefore, ignoring\r\nthe relief which may be afforded by overflows, if the sewers\r\nare tide-locked for a period of 2-1/2 hours or over it would\r\nappear to be necessary to provide storage for the rainfall of a\r\nwhole day; but in this case again it is permissible to run a\r\ncertain amount of risk, varying with the length of time the\r\nsewers are tide-locked, because, first of all, it only rains on\r\nthe average on about 160 days in the year, and, secondly, when\r\nit does rain, it may not be at the time when the sewers are\r\ntide-locked, although it is frequently found that the heaviest\r\nstorms occur just at the most inconvenient time, namely, about\r\nhigh water.

It\r\nmust be further remembered that the wettest year is not\r\nnecessarily the year of the heaviest rainfalls, and it is the\r\nheavy rainfalls only which affect the design of sewerage works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nSTORM WATER IN SEWERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the whole area of the district is not impermeable the\r\npercentage which is so must be carefully estimated, and will\r\nnaturally vary in each case. The means of arriving at an\r\nestimate will also probably vary considerably according to\r\ncircumstances, but the following figures, which relate to\r\ninvestigations recently made by the writer, may be of interest.\r\nIn the town, which has a population of 10,000 and an area of\r\n2,037 acres, the total length of roads constructed was 74,550\r\nlineal feet, and their average width was 36 ft, including two\r\nfootpaths. The average density of the population was 4.9 people\r\nper acre. Houses were erected adjoining a length of 43,784\r\nlineal feet of roads, leaving 30,766 lineal feet, which for\r\ndistinction may be called \"undeveloped\"--that is, the land\r\nadjoining them was not built over. Dividing the length of road\r\noccupied by houses by the total number of the inhabitants of\r\nthe town, the average length of road per head was 4.37 ft, and\r\nassuming five people per house and one house on each side of\r\nthe road we get ten people per two houses opposite each other.\r\nThen 10 x 4.37 = 43.7 lineal feet of road frontage to each pair\r\nof opposite houses. After a very careful inspection of the\r\nwhole town, the average area of the impermeable surfaces\r\nappertaining to each house was estimated at 675 sq. ft, of\r\nwhich 300 sq. ft was apportioned to the front roof and garden\r\npaths and 375 sq. ft to the back roof and paved yards. Dividing\r\nthese figures by 43.71 in ft of road frontage per house, we\r\nfind that the effective width of the impermeable roadway is\r\nincreased by 6 ft 10 in for the front portions of each house,\r\nand by a width of 8 ft 7 in, for the back portions, making a\r\ntotal width of 36 ft + 2(6 ft 10 in) + 2(8 ft 7 in) = 66 ft 10\r\nin, say 67 ft On this basis the impermeable area in the town\r\ntherefore equals: 43,7841 in ft x 67 ft =2,933,528; and 30,766\r\nlin ft x 36 ft = 1,107,576.\r\n\r\nTotal, 4,041,104 sq. ft, or 92.77 acres. As the population is\r\n10,000 the impermeable area equals 404, say, 400 sq. ft per\r\nhead, or ~ (92.77 x 100) / 2037 = 4.5 per cent, of the whole\r\narea of the town.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that when rain continues for long\r\nperiods, ground which in the ordinary way would generally be\r\nconsidered permeable becomes soaked and eventually becomes more\r\nor less impermeable. Mr. D. E. Lloyd-Davies, M.Inst.C.E., gives\r\ntwo very interesting diagrams in the paper previously referred\r\nto, which show the average percentage of effective impermeable\r\narea according to the population per acre. This information,\r\nwhich is applicable more to large towns, has been embodied in\r\nFig. 16, from which it will be seen that, for storms of short\r\nduration, the proportion of impervious areas equals 5 per cent.\r\nwith a population of 4.9 per acre, which is a very close\r\napproximation to the 4.5 per cent. obtained in the example just\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nWhere the houses are scattered at long intervals along a road\r\nthe better way to arrive at an estimate of the quantity of\r\nstorm water which may be expected is to ascertain the average\r\nimpervious area of, or appertaining to, each house, and divide\r\nit by five, so as to get the area per head. Then the flow off\r\nfrom any section of road is directly obtained from the sum of\r\nthe impervious area due to the length of the road, and that due\r\nto the population distributed along it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--VARIATION IN AVERAGE PERCENTAGE OF\r\nEFFECTIVE IMPERMEABLE AREA ACCORDING TO DENSITY OF POPULATION.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to being undesirable from a sanitary point of view,\r\nit is rarely economical to construct special storm water\r\ndrains, but in all cases where they exist, allowance must be\r\nmade for any rain that may be intercepted by them. Short branch\r\nsewers constructed for the conveyance of foul water alone are\r\nusually 9in or 12 in in diameter, not because those sizes are\r\nnecessary to convey the quantity of liquid which may be\r\nexpected, but because it is frequently undesirable to provide\r\nsmaller public sewers, and there is generally sufficient room\r\nfor the storm water without increasing the size of the sewer.\r\nIf this storm water were conveyed in separate sewers the cost\r\nwould be double, as two sewers would be required in the place\r\nof one. In the main sewers the difference is not so great, but\r\ngenerally one large sewer will be more economical than two\r\nsmaller ones. Where duplicate sewers are provided and arranged,\r\nso that the storm water sewer takes the rain-water from the\r\nroads, front roofs and gardens of the houses, and the foul\r\nwater sewer takes the rain-water from the back roofs and paved\r\nyards,\r\n\r\nit was found in the case previously worked out in detail that\r\nin built-up roads a width of 36 ft + 2 (8 ft 7 in) = 53 ft 2\r\nin, or, say, 160 sq. ft per lineal yard of road would drain to\r\nthe storm water sewer, and a width of 2 (6 ft 10 in) = 13 ft 8\r\nin, or, say, 41 sq. ft per lineal yard of road to the foul\r\nwater sewer. This shows that even if the whole of the rain\r\nwhich falls on the impervious areas flows off, only just under\r\n80 per cent. of it would be intercepted by the special storm water\r\nsewers. Taking an average annual rainfall of 30 in, of which 75 per\r\ncent. flows off, the quantity reaching the storm water sewer in the\r\ncourse of a year from each lineal\r\n\r\n                       30          75\r\nyard of road would be --- x 160 x --- = 300 cubic\r\n                       12         100\r\nfeet = 1,875 gallons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--SECTION OF \"LEAP WEIR\" OVERFLOW]\r\n\r\nThe cost of constructing a separate surface water system will\r\nvary, but may be taken at an average of, approximately, l5s.\r\n0d. per lineal yard of road. To repay this amount in thirty years\r\nat 4 per cent, would require a sum of 10.42d., say 10-1/2d. per annum;\r\nthat is to say, the cost of taking the surface water into special\r\n\r\n           10-1/2 d. x 1000\r\nsewers is  ---------------- = 5.6, say 6d. per 1,000\r\n                 1875\r\ngallons.\r\n\r\nIf the sewage has to be pumped, the extra cost of pumping by\r\nreason of the increased quantity of surface water can be looked\r\nat from two different points of view:--\r\n\r\n1. The net cost of the gas or other fuel or electric current\r\nconsumed in lifting the water.\r\n\r\n2. The cost of the fuel consumed plus wages, stores, etc., and\r\na proportion of the sum required to repay the capital cost of\r\nthe pumping station and machinery.\r\n\r\nThe extra cost of the sewers to carry the additional quantity\r\nof storm water might also be taken into account by working out\r\nand preparing estimates for the alternative schemes.\r\n\r\nThe actual cost of the fuel may be taken at approximately 1/4\r\nd. per 1,000 gallons. The annual works and capital charges,\r\nexclusive of fuel, should be divided by the normal quantity of\r\nsewage pumped per annum, rather than by the maximum quantity\r\nwhich the pumps would lift if they were able to run\r\ncontinuously during the whole time. For a town of about 10,000\r\ninhabitants these charges may be taken at 1-1/4 d. per 1,000\r\ngallons, which makes the total cost of pumping, inclusive of\r\ncapital charges, 1-1/2 d. per 1,000 gallons. Even if the extra\r\ncost of enlarging the sewers is added to this sum it will still\r\nbe considerably below the sum of 6 d., which represents the\r\ncost of providing a separate system for the surface water.\r\n\r\nUnless it is permissible for the sewage to have a free outlet\r\nto the sea at all states of the tide, the provision of\r\neffective storm overflows is a matter of supreme importance.\r\nNot only is it necessary for them to be constructed in well-\r\nconsidered positions, but they must be effective in action. A\r\nweir constructed along one side of a manhole and parallel to\r\nthe sewer is rarely efficient, as in times of storm the liquid\r\nin the sewer travels at a considerable velocity, and the\r\ngreater portion of it, which should be diverted, rushes past\r\nthe weir and continues to flow in the sewer; and if, as is\r\nfrequently the case, it is desirable that the overflowing\r\nliquid should be screened, and vertical bars are fixed on the\r\nweir for the purpose, they block the outlet and render the\r\noverflow practically useless.\r\n\r\nLeap weir overflows are theoretically most suitable for\r\nseparating the excess flow during times of storm, but in\r\npractice they rarely prove satisfactory. This is not the fault\r\nof the system, but is, in the majority of the cases, if not\r\nall, due to defective designing. The general arrangement of a\r\nleap weir overflow is shown in Fig. 17. In normal circumstances\r\nthe sewage flowing along the pipe A falls down the ramp, and\r\nthence along the sewer B; when the flow is increased during\r\nstorms the sewage from A shoots out from the end of the pipe\r\ninto the trough C, and thence along the storm-water sewer D. In\r\norder that it should be effective the first step is to\r\nascertain accurately the gradient of the sewer above the\r\nproposed overflow, then, the size being known, it is easy to\r\ncalculate the velocity of flow for the varying depths of sewage\r\ncorresponding with minimum flow, average dry weather flow,\r\nmaximum dry weather flow, and six times the dry weather flow.\r\nThe natural curve which the sewage would follow in its downward\r\npath as it flowed out from the end of the sewer can then be\r\ndrawn out for the various depths, taking into account the fact\r\nthat the velocity at the invert and sides of the sewer is less\r\nthan the average velocity of flow. The ramp should be built in\r\naccordance with the calculated curves so as to avoid splashing\r\nas far as possible, and the level of the trough C fixed so that\r\nwhen it is placed sufficiently far from A to allow the dry\r\nweather flow to pass down the ramp it will at the same time\r\ncatch the storm water when the required dilution has taken\r\nplace. Due regard must be had to the altered circumstances\r\nwhich will arise when the growth of population occurs, for\r\nwhich provision is made in the scheme, so that the overflow\r\nwill remain efficient. The trough C is movable, so that the\r\nwidth of the leap weir may be adjusted from time to time as\r\nrequired. The overflow should be frequently inspected, and the\r\naccumulated rubbish removed from the trough, because sticks and\r\nsimilar matters brought down by the sewer will probably leap\r\nthe weir instead of flowing down the ramp with the sewage. It\r\nis undesirable to fix a screen in conjunction with this\r\noverflow, but if screening is essential the operation should be\r\ncarried out in a special manhole built lower down the course of\r\nthe storm-water sewer. Considerable wear takes place on the\r\nramp, which should, therefore, be constructed of blue\r\nStaffordshire or other hard bricks. The ramp should terminate\r\nin a stone block to resist the impact of the falling water, and\r\nthe stones which may be brought with it, which would crack\r\nstoneware pipes if such were used.\r\n\r\nIn cases where it is not convenient to arrange a sudden drop in\r\nthe invert of the sewer as is required for a leap weir\r\noverflow, the excess flow of storm-water may be diverted by an\r\narrangement similar to that shown in Fig. 18. [Footnote: PLATE\r\nIV] In this case calculations must be made to ascertain the\r\ndepth at which the sewage will flow in the pipes at the time it\r\nis diluted to the required extent; this gives the level of the\r\nlip of the diverting plate. The ordinary sewage flow will pass\r\nsteadily along the invert of the sewer under the plate until it\r\nrises up to that height, when the opening becomes a submerged\r\norifice, and its discharging capacity becomes less than when\r\nthe sewage was flowing freely. This restricts the flow of the\r\nsewage, and causes it to head up on the upper side of the\r\noverflow in an endeavour to force through the orifice the same\r\nquantity as is flowing in the sewer, but as it rises the\r\nvelocity carries the upper layer of the water forward up the\r\ndiverting plate and thence into the storm overflow drain A deep\r\nchannel is desirable, so as to govern the direction of flow at\r\nthe time the overflow is in action. The diverting trough is\r\nmovable, and its height above the invert can be increased\r\neasily, as may be necessary from time to time. With this\r\narrangement the storm-water can easily be screened before it is\r\nallowed to pass out by fixing an inclined screen in the\r\nposition shown in Fig. 18. [Footnote: PLATE IV] It is loose, as\r\nis the trough, and both can be lifted out when it is desired to\r\nhave access to the invert of the sewer. The screen is self-\r\ncleansing, as any floating matter which may be washed against\r\nit does not stop on it and reduce its discharging capacity, but\r\nis gradually drawn down by the flow of the sewage towards the\r\ndiverting plate under which it will be carried. The heavier\r\nmatter in the sewage which flows along the invert will pass\r\nunder the plate and be carried through to the outfall works,\r\ninstead of escaping by the overflow, and perhaps creating a\r\nnuisance at that point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nWIND AND WINDMILLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn small sewerage schemes where pumping is necessary the amount\r\nexpended in the wages of an attendant who must give his whole\r\nattention to the pumping station is so much in excess of the\r\ncost of power and the sum required for the repayment of the\r\nloan for the plant and buildings that it is desirable for the\r\neconomical working of the scheme to curtail the wages bill as\r\nfar as possible. If oil or gas engines are employed the man\r\ncannot be absent for many minutes together while the machinery\r\nis running, and when it is not running, as for instance during\r\nthe night, he must be prepared to start the pumps at very short\r\nnotice, should a heavy rain storm increase the flow in the\r\nsewers to such an extent that the pump well or storage tank\r\nbecomes filled up. It is a simple matter to arrange floats\r\nwhereby the pump may be connected to or disconnected from a\r\nrunning engine by means of a friction clutch, so that when the\r\nlevel of the sewage in the pump well reaches the highest point\r\ndesired the pump may be started, and when it is lowered to a\r\npredetermined low water level the pump will stop; but it is\r\nimpracticable to control the engine in the same way, so that\r\nalthough the floats are a useful accessory to the plant during\r\nthe temporary absence of the man in charge they will not\r\nobviate his more or less constant attendance. An electric motor\r\nmay be controlled by a float, but in many cases trouble is\r\nexperienced with the switch gear, probably caused by its\r\nexposure to the damp air. In all cases an alarm float should be\r\nfixed, which would rise as the depth of the sewage in the pump\r\nwell increased, until the top water level was reached, when the\r\nfloat would make an electrical contact and start a continuous\r\nringing warning bell, which could be placed either at the pumping\r\nstation or at the man's residence. On hearing the bell the man would\r\nknow the pump well was full, and that he must immediately repair to\r\nthe pumping-station and start the pumps, otherwise the building\r\nwould be flooded. If compressed air is available a hooter could be\r\nfixed, which would be heard for a considerable distance from the station.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV.\r\n\r\n\"DIVERTING PLATE\" OVERFLOW.\r\n\r\nTo face page 66.]\r\n\r\nIt is apparent, therefore, that a pumping machine is wanted\r\nwhich will work continuously without attention, and will not\r\nwaste money when there is nothing to pump. There are two\r\nsources of power in nature which might be harnessed to give\r\nthis result--water and wind. The use of water on such a small\r\nscale is rarely economically practicable, as even if the water\r\nis available in the vicinity of the pumping-station,\r\nconsiderable work has generally to be executed at the point of\r\nsupply, not only to store the water in sufficient bulk at such\r\na level that it can be usefully employed, but also to lead it\r\nto the power-house, and then to provide for its escape after it\r\nhas done its work. The power-house, with its turbines and other\r\nmachinery, involves a comparatively large outlay, but if the\r\npump can be directly driven from the turbines, so that the cost\r\nof attendance is reduced to a minimum, the system should\r\ncertainly receive consideration.\r\n\r\nAlthough the wind is always available in every district, it is\r\nmore frequent and powerful on the coast than inland. The\r\nvelocity of the wind is ever varying within wide limits, and\r\nalthough the records usually give the average hourly velocity,\r\nit is not constant even for one minute. Windmills of the modern\r\ntype, consisting of a wheel composed of a number of short sails\r\nfixed to a steel framework upon a braced steel tower, have been\r\nused for many years for driving machinery on farms, and less\r\nfrequently for pumping water for domestic use. In a very few\r\ncases it has been utilised for pumping sewage, but there is no\r\nreason why, under proper conditions, it should not be employed\r\nto a greater extent. The reliability of the wind for pumping\r\npurposes may be gauged from the figures in the following table,\r\nNo. 11, which were observed in Birmingham, and comprise a\r\nperiod of ten years; they are arranged in order corresponding\r\nwith the magnitude of the annual rainfall:--\r\n\r\nTABLE No. 11.\r\n\r\nMEAN HOURLY VELOCITY OF WIND\r\n\r\nReference | Rainfall |Number of days in year during which the mean  |\r\nNumber    | for      |hourly velocity of the wind was below         |\r\n          | year     | 6 m.p.h. | 10 m.p.h. | 15 m.p.h. | 20 m.p.h. |\r\n----------+----------+----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n 1...       33·86         16          88         220        314\r\n 2...       29·12         15         120         260        334\r\n 3...       28·86         39         133         263        336\r\n 4...       26·56         36         126         247        323\r\n 5...       26·51         34         149         258        330\r\n 6...       26·02         34         132         262        333\r\n 7...       25·16         33         151         276        332\r\n 8...       22·67         46         155         272        329\r\n 9...       22·30         26         130         253        337\r\n10...       21·94         37         133         276        330\r\n----------+----------+----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n            Average       31·4       131·7       250·7      330·8\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to examine the monthly figures for the\r\ntwo years included in the foregoing table, which had the least\r\nand the most wind respectively, such figures being set out in\r\nthe following table:\r\n\r\nTABLE No. 12\r\n\r\nMONTHLY ANALYSIS OF WIND\r\n\r\nNumber of days in each month during which the mean velocity of\r\nthe wind was respectively below the value mentioned hereunder.\r\n\r\n\r\nMonth |  Year of least wind (No. 8) | Year of most wind (No. *8*) |\r\n      |   5      10     15     20   |   5      10     15     20   |\r\n      | m.p.h. m.p.h. m.p.h. m.p.h. | m.p.h. m.p.h. m.p.h. m.p.h. |\r\n------+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+------+------+-------+\r\nJan.      5      11     23     27       3       6     15     23\r\nFeb.      5      19     23     28       0       2      8     16\r\nMar.      5      10     20     23       0       1     11     18\r\nApril     6      16     23     28       1       7     16     26\r\nMay       1      14     24     30       3      11     24     31\r\nJune      1      12     22     26       1      10     21     27\r\nJuly      8      18     29     31       1      12     25     29\r\nAug.      2       9     23     30       1       9     18     30\r\nSept.     1      13     25     30       1      12     24     28\r\nOct.      5      17     21     26       0       4     16     29\r\nNov.      6      11     20     26       3       7     19     28\r\nDec.      1       5     19     24       2       7     23     29\r\n------+-------+-----+-------+-------+-------+------+------+-------+\r\nTotal    46     155    272    329      16      88    220    314\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the year of least wind there were only eight separate\r\noccasions upon which the average hourly velocity of the wind\r\nwas less than six miles per hour for two consecutive days, and\r\non two occasions only was it less than six miles per hour on\r\nthree consecutive days. It must be remembered, however, that\r\nthis does not by any means imply that during such days the wind\r\ndid not rise above six miles per hour, and the probability is\r\nthat a mill which could be actuated by a six-mile wind would\r\nhave been at work during part of the time. It will further be\r\nobserved that the greatest differences between these two years\r\noccur in the figures relating to the light winds. The number of\r\ndays upon which the mean hourly velocity of the wind exceeds\r\ntwenty miles per hour remains fairly constant year after year.\r\n\r\nAs the greatest difficulty in connection with pumping sewage is\r\nthe influx of storm water in times of rain, it will be useful\r\nto notice the rainfall at those times when the wind is at a\r\nminimum. From the following figures (Table No. 13) it will be\r\nseen that, generally speaking, when there is very little wind\r\nthere is very little rain Taking the ten years enumerated in\r\nTable No. 11, we find that out of the 314 days on which the\r\nwind averaged less than six miles per hour only forty-eight of\r\nthem were wet, and then the rainfall only averaged .l3 in on\r\nthose days.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE No. 13.\r\n\r\nWIND LESS THAN 6 M.P.H.\r\n\r\n-----------+-------------+------------+--------+----------------------------------\r\n Ref.

In America many towers\r\nare as much as 100 ft high, but ordinary workmen do not\r\nvoluntarily climb to such a height, with the result that the\r\nmill is not properly oiled. About 40 ft is the usual height in\r\nthis country, and 60 ft should be used as a maximum.\r\n\r\nMr. George Phelps, in a paper read by him in 1906 before the\r\nAssociation of Water Engineers, stated that it was safe to\r\nassume that on an average a fifteen miles per hour wind was\r\navailable for eight hours per day, and from this he gave the\r\nfollowing figures as representing the approximate average duty\r\nwith, a lift of l00 ft, including friction:--\r\n\r\nTABLE NO. 14\r\nDUTY OF WINTDMILU\r\n\r\nDiameter of Wheel.\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\n16\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\n25\r\n\r\n30\r\n\r\n35\r\n\r\n40\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the result of tests carried out by\r\nthe United States Department of Agriculture at Cheyenne, Wyo.,\r\nwith a l4 ft diameter windmill under differing wind\r\nvelocities:--\r\n\r\nTABLE No. 15.\r\n\r\nPOWER or l4-rx WINDMILL IN VARYING WINDS.\r\n\r\nVelocity of Wind (miles per hour).\r\n\r\n0--5 6-10 11-15 16-20 21-25 26-30 31-35\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be apparent from the foregoing figures that practically\r\nthe whole of the pumping for a small sewerage works may be done\r\nby means of a windmill, but it is undesirable to rely entirely\r\nupon such a system, even if two mills are erected so that the\r\nplant will be in duplicate, because there is always the\r\npossibility, although it may be remote, of a lengthened period\r\nof calm, when the sewage would accumulate; and, further, the\r\nLocal Government Board would not approve the scheme unless it\r\nincluded an engine, driven by gas, oil, or other mechanical\r\npower, for emergencies. In the case of water supply the\r\ndifficulty may be overcome by providing large storage capacity,\r\nbut this cannot be done for sewage without creating an\r\nintolerable nuisance. In the latter case the storage should not\r\nbe less than twelve hours dry weather flow, nor more than\r\ntwenty-four. With a well-designed mill, as has already been\r\nindicated, the wind will, for the greater part of the year, be\r\nsufficient to lift the whole of the sewage and storm-water,\r\nbut, if it is allowed to do so, the standby engine will\r\ndeteriorate for want of use to such an extent that when\r\nurgently needed it will not be effective. It is, therefore,\r\ndesirable that the attendant should run the engine at least\r\nonce in every three days to keep it in working order. If it can\r\nbe conveniently arranged, it is a good plan for the attendant\r\nto run the engine for a few minutes to entirely empty the pump\r\nwell about six o'clock each evening. The bulk of the day's\r\nsewage will then have been delivered, and can be disposed of\r\nwhen it is fresh, while at the same time the whole storage\r\ncapacity is available for the night flow, and any rainfall\r\nwhich may occur, thus reducing the chances of the man being\r\ncalled up during the night. About 22 per cent, of the total\r\ndaily dry weather flow of sewage is delivered between 7 p.m.\r\nand 7 a.m.\r\n\r\nThe first cost of installing a small windmill is practically\r\nthe same as for an equivalent gas or oil engine plant, so that\r\nthe only advantage to be looked for will be in the maintenance,\r\nwhich in the case of a windmill is a very small matter, and the\r\nsaving which may be obtained by the reduction of the amount of\r\nattendance necessary. Generally speaking, a mill 20 ft in\r\ndiameter is the largest which should be used, as when this size\r\nis exceeded it will be found that the capital cost involved is\r\nincompatible with the value of the work done by the mill, as\r\ncompared with that done by a modern internal combustion engine.\r\n\r\n\r\nMills smaller than 8 ft in diameter are rarely employed, and\r\nthen only for small work, such as a 2 1/2 in pump and a 3-ft\r\nlift The efficiency of a windmill, measured by the number of\r\nsquare feet of annular sail area, decreases with the size of\r\nthe mill, the 8 ft, 10 ft, and l2 ft mills being the most\r\nefficient sizes. When the diameter exceeds l2 ft, the\r\nefficiency rapidly falls off, because the peripheral velocity\r\nremains constant for any particular velocity or pressure of the\r\nwind, and as every foot increase in the diameter of the wheel\r\nmakes an increase of over 3 ft in the length of the\r\ncircumference, the greater the diameter the less the number of\r\nrevolutions in any given time; and consequently the kinetic\r\nflywheel action which is so valuable in the smaller sizes is to\r\na great extent lost in the larger mills.\r\n\r\nAny type of pump can be used, but the greatest efficiency will\r\nbe obtained by adopting a single acting pump with a short\r\nstroke, thus avoiding the liability, inherent in a long pump\r\nrod, to buckle under compression, and obviating the use of a\r\nlarge number of guides which absorb a large part of the power\r\ngiven out by the mill. Although some of the older mills in this\r\ncountry are of foreign origin, there are several British\r\nmanufacturers turning out well-designed and strongly-built\r\nmachines in large numbers. Fig. 19 represents the general\r\nappearance and Fig. 20 the details of the type of mill made by\r\nthe well-known firm of Duke and Ockenden, of Ferry Wharf,\r\nLittlehampton, Sussex. This firm has erected over 400\r\nwindmills, which, after the test of time, have proved\r\nthoroughly efficient. From Fig. 20 it will be seen that the\r\npower applied by the wheel is transmitted through spur and\r\npinion gearing of 2 1/2 ratio to a crank shaft, the gear wheel\r\nhaving internal annular teeth of the involute type, giving a\r\ngreater number of teeth always in contact than is the case with\r\nexternal gears. This minimises wear, which is an important matter,\r\nas it is difficult to properly lubricate these appliances, and they\r\nare exposed to and have to work in all sorts of weather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Fig. l9.--General View of Modern Windmill.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Fig. 20.--Details of Windmill Manufactured by Messrs. Duke and\r\nOckenden, Littlehampton.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the strain on the crank shaft is taken by\r\na bent crank which disposes the load centrally on the casting,\r\nand avoids an overhanging crank disc, which has been an\r\nobjectionable feature in some other types. The position of the\r\ncrank shaft relative to the rocker pin holes is studied to give\r\na slow upward motion to the rocker with a more rapid downward\r\nstroke, the difference in speed being most marked in the\r\nlongest stroke, where it is most required.\r\n\r\nIn order to transmit the circular internal motion a vertical\r\nconnecting rod in compression is used, which permits of a\r\nsimple method of changing the length of stroke by merely\r\naltering the pin in the rocking lever, the result being that\r\nthe pump rod travels in a vertical line.\r\n\r\nThe governing is entirely automatic. If the pressure on the\r\nwind wheel, which it will be seen is set off the centre line of\r\nthe mill and tower, exceeds that found desirable--and this can\r\nbe regulated by means of a spring on the fantail--the windmill\r\nautomatically turns on the turn-table and presents an ellipse\r\nto the wind instead of a circular face, thus decreasing the\r\narea exposed to the wind gradually until the wheel reaches its\r\nfinal position, or is hauled out of gear, when the edges only\r\nare opposed to the full force of the wind. The whole weight of\r\nthe mill is taken upon a ball-bearing turn-table to facilitate\r\ninstant \"hunting\" of the mill to the wind to enable it to take\r\nadvantage of all changes of direction. The pump rod in the\r\nwindmill tower is provided with a swivel coupling, enabling the\r\nmill head to turn completely round without altering the\r\nposition of the rod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE DESIGN OF SEE OUTFALLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe detail design of a sea outfall will depend upon the level\r\nof the conduit with reference to present surface of the shore,\r\nwhether the beach is being eroded or made up, and, if any part\r\nof the structure is to be constructed above the level of the\r\nshore, whether it is likely to be subject to serious attack by\r\nwaves in times of heavy gales. If there is probability of the\r\ndirection of currents being affected by the construction of a\r\nsolid structure or of any serious scour being caused, the\r\ndesign must be prepared accordingly.\r\n\r\nWhile there are examples of outfalls constructed of glazed\r\nstoneware socketed pipes surrounded with concrete, as shown in\r\nFig. 21, cast iron pipes are used in the majority of cases.\r\nThere is considerable variation in the design of the joints for\r\nthe latter class of pipes, some of which are shown in Figs. 22,\r\n23, and 24. Spigot and socket joints (Fig. 22), with lead run\r\nin, or even with rod lead or any of the patent forms caulked in\r\ncold, are unsuitable for use below high-water mark on account\r\nof the water which will most probably be found in the trench.\r\nPipes having plain turned and bored joints are liable to be\r\ndisplaced if exposed to the action of the waves, but if such\r\njoints are also flanged, as Fig. 24, or provided with lugs, as\r\nFig. 23, great rigidity is obtained when they are bolted up; in\r\naddition to which the joints are easily made watertight. When a\r\nflange is formed all round the joint, it is necessary, in order\r\nthat its thickness may be kept within reasonable limits, to\r\nprovide bolts at frequent intervals. A gusset piece to stiffen\r\nthe flange should be formed between each hole and the next, and\r\nthe bolt holes should be arranged so that when the pipes are\r\nlaid there will not be a hole at the bottom on the vertical\r\naxis of the pipe, as when the pipes are laid in a trench below\r\nwater level it is not only difficult to insert the bolt, but\r\nalmost impracticable to tighten up the nut afterwards. The\r\npipes should be laid so that the two lowest bolt holes are\r\nplaced equidistant on each side of the centre line, as shown in\r\nthe end views of Figs. Nos. 23 and 24.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Fig. 2l.-Stoneware Pipe and Concrete Sea Outfall.]\r\n\r\nWith lug pipes, fewer bolts are used, and the lugs are made\r\nspecially strong to withstand the strain put upon them in\r\nbolting up the pipes. These pipes are easier and quicker to\r\njoint under water than are the flanged pipes, so that their use\r\nis a distinct advantage when the hours of working are limited.\r\nIn some cases gun-metal bolts are used, as they resist the\r\naction of sea water better than steel, but they add\r\nconsiderably to the cost of the outfall sewer, and the\r\nprincipal advantage appears to be that they are possibly easier\r\nto remove than iron or steel ones would be if at any time it\r\nwas required to take out any pipe which may have been\r\naccidentally broken. On the other hand, there is a liability of\r\nsevere corrosion of the metal taking place by reason of\r\ngalvanic action between the gun-metal and the iron, set up by\r\nthe sea water in which they are immersed. If the pipes are not\r\nto be covered with concrete, and are thus exposed to the action\r\nof the sea water, particular care should be taken to see that\r\nthe coating by Dr. Angus Smith's process is perfectly applied\r\nto them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Fig. 22.--Spigot and Socket Joint for Cast Iron Pipes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Fig. 23.--Lug Joint for Cast Iron Pipes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Fig. 24.--Turned, Board, and Flanged Joint for Cast Iron Pipes.]\r\n\r\nSteel pipes are, on the whole, not so suitable as cast iron.\r\nThey are, of course, obtainable in long lengths and are easily\r\njointed, but their lightness compared with cast iron pipes,\r\nwhich is their great advantage in transport, is a disadvantage\r\nin a sea outfall, where the weight of the structure adds to its\r\nstability. The extra length of steel pipes necessitates a\r\ngreater extent of trench being excavated at one time, which\r\nmust be well timbered to prevent the sides falling in On the\r\nother hand, cast iron pipes are more liable to fracture by\r\nheavy stones being thrown upon them by the waves, but this is a\r\ncontingency which does not frequently occur in practice.\r\nAccording to Trautwine, the cast iron for pipes to resist sea\r\nwater should be close-grained, hard, white metal. In such metal\r\nthe small quantity of contained carbon is chemically combined\r\nwith the iron, but in the darker or mottled metals it is\r\nmechanically combined, and such iron soon becomes soft, like\r\nplumbago, under the influence of sea water. Hard white iron has\r\nbeen proved to resist sea water for forty years without\r\ndeterioration, whether it is continually under water or\r\nalternately wet and dry.\r\n\r\nSeveral types of sea outfalls are shown in Figs. 25 to 31.[1]\r\nIn the example shown in Fig. 25 a solid rock bed occurred a\r\nshort distance below the sand, which was excavated so as to\r\nallow the outfall to be constructed on the rock. Anchor bolts\r\nwith clevis heads were fixed into the rock, and then, after a\r\nportion of the concrete was laid, iron bands, passing around\r\nthe cast iron pipes, were fastened to the anchors. This\r\nconstruction would not be suitable below low-water mark. Fig.\r\n26 represents the Aberdeen sea outfall, consisting of cast iron\r\npipes 7 ft in diameter, which are embedded in a heavy concrete\r\nbreakwater 24 ft in width, except at the extreme end, where it\r\nis 30 ft wide. The 4 in wrought iron rods are only used to the\r\nlast few pipes, which were in 6 ft lengths instead of 9 ft, as\r\nwere the remainder. Fig. 27 shows an inexpensive method of\r\ncarrying small pipes, the slotted holes in the head of the pile\r\nallowing the pipes to be laid in a straight line, even if the\r\npile is not driven quite true, and if the level of the latter\r\nis not correct it can be adjusted by inserting a packing piece\r\nbetween the cradle and the head.\r\n\r\nGreat Crosby outfall sewer into the Mersey is illustrated in\r\nFig. 28. The piles are of greenheart, and were driven to a\r\nsolid foundation. The 1 3/4 in sheeting was driven to support\r\nthe sides of the excavation, and was left in when the concrete\r\nwas laid. Light steel rails were laid under the sewer, in\r\ncontinuous lengths, on steel sleepers and to 2 ft gauge. The\r\ninvert blocks were of concrete, and the pipes were made of the\r\nsame material, but were reinforced with steel ribs. The Waterloo\r\n(near Liverpool) sea outfall is shown in Fig. 31.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Plate V.]\r\n\r\nPiling may be necessary either to support the pipes or to keep\r\nthem secure in their proper position, but where there is a\r\nsubstratum of rock the pipes may be anchored, as shown in Figs.\r\n25 and 26. The nature of the piling to be adopted will vary\r\naccording to the character of the beach. Figs. 27, 29, 30, and\r\n31 show various types. With steel piling and bearers, as shown\r\nin Fig. 29, it is generally difficult to drive the piles with\r\nsuch accuracy that the bearers may be easily bolted up through\r\nthe holes provided in the piles, and, if the holes are not\r\ndrilled in the piles until after they are driven to their final\r\nposition, considerable time is occupied, and perhaps a tide\r\nlost in the attempt to drill them below water. There is also\r\nthe difficulty of tightening up the bolts when the sewer is\r\npartly below the surface of the shore, as shown. In both the\r\ntypes shown in Figs. 29 and 30 it is essential that the piles\r\nand the bearers should abut closely against the pipes;\r\notherwise the shock of the waves will cause the pipes to move\r\nand hammer against the framing, and thus lead to failure of the\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nPiles similar to Fig. 31 can only be fixed in sand, as was the\r\ncase at Waterloo, because they must be absolutely true to line\r\nand level, otherwise the pipes cannot be laid in the cradles.\r\nThe method of fixing these piles is described by Mr. Ben\r\nHowarth (Minutes of Proceedings of Inst.C.E., Vol. CLXXV.) as\r\nfollows:--\"The pile was slung vertically into position from a\r\nfour-legged derrick, two legs of which were on each side of the\r\ntrench; a small winch attached to one pair of the legs lifted\r\nand lowered the pile, through a block and tackle. When the pile\r\nwas ready to be sunk, a 2 in iron pipe was let down the centre,\r\nand coupled to a force-pump by means of a hose; a jet of water\r\nwas then forced down this pipe, driving the sand and silt away\r\nfrom below the pile. The pile was then rotated backwards and\r\nforwards about a quarter of a turn, by men pulling on the arms;\r\nthe pile, of course, sank by its own weight, the water-jet\r\ndriving the sand up through the hollow centre and into the\r\ntrench, and it was always kept vertical by the sling from the\r\nderrick. As soon as the pile was down to its final level the ground\r\nwas filled in round the arms, and in this running sand the pile\r\nbecame perfectly fast and immovable a few minutes after the\r\nsinking was completed. The whole process, from the first\r\nslinging of the pile to the final setting, did not take more\r\nthan 20 or 25 minutes.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V.\r\n\r\nROCK BED. Fig. 26--ABERDEEN SEA OUTFALL. Fig. 27--SMALL GREAT\r\nCROSBY SEA OUTFALL. Fig. 29--CAST IRON PIPE ON STEEL CAST AND\r\nBEARERS. Fig. 31--WATERLOO (LIVERPOOL) SEA OUTFALL.]\r\n\r\n(_To face page 80_.)\r\n\r\nScrew piles may be used if the ground is suitable, but, if it\r\nis boulder clay or similar material, the best results will\r\nprobably be obtained by employing rolled steel joists as piles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE ACTION OF SEA WATER ON CEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestions are frequently raised in connection with sea-coast\r\nworks as to whether any deleterious effect will result from\r\nusing sea-water for mixing the concrete or from using sand and\r\nshingle off the beach; and, further, whether the concrete,\r\nafter it is mixed, will withstand the action of the elements,\r\nexposed, as it will be, to air and sea-water, rain, hot sun,\r\nand frosts.\r\n\r\nSome concrete structures have failed by decay of the material,\r\nprincipally between high and low water mark, and in order to\r\nascertain the probable causes and to learn the precautions\r\nwhich it is necessary to take, some elaborate experiments have\r\nbeen carried out.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate the chemical actions which may occur, it will be\r\nas well to examine analyses of sea-water and cement.

Michaelis, the German cement specialist, gave much\r\nconsideration to this matter in 1906, and formed the opinion\r\nthat the free lime in the Portland cement, or the lime freed in\r\nhardening, combines with the sulphuric acid of the sea-water,\r\nwhich causes the mortar or cement to expand, resulting in its\r\ndestruction. He proposed to neutralise this action by adding to\r\nthe mortar materials rich in silica, such as trass, which would\r\ncombine with the lime.\r\n\r\nMr. J. M. O'Hara, of the Southern Pacific Laboratory, San\r\nFrancisco, Cal., made a series of tests with sets of pats 4 in\r\ndiameter and 1/2 in thick at the centre, tapering to a thin\r\nedge on the circumference, and also with briquettes for\r\nascertaining the tensile strength, all of which were placed\r\nin water twenty-four hours after mixing. At first some of the\r\npats were immersed in a \"five-strength solution\" of sea-water\r\nhaving a chemical analysis as follows:--\r\n\r\nSodium chloride.................... 11.5 per cent.\r\nMagnesium chloride.................  1.4   \"   \"\r\nMagnesium sulphate.................  0.9   \"   \"\r\nCalcium sulphate...................  0.6   \"   \"\r\nWater.............................. 85.6   \"   \"\r\n                                   100.0\r\n\r\nThis strong solution was employed in order that the probable\r\neffect of immersing the cement in sea-water might be\r\nascertained very much quicker than could be done by observing\r\nsamples actually placed in ordinary sea-water, and it is worthy\r\nof note that the various mixtures which failed in this\r\naccelerated test also subsequently failed in ordinary sea-water\r\nwithin a period of twelve months.\r\n\r\nStrong solutions were next made of the individual salts\r\ncontained in sea-water, and pats were immersed as before, when\r\nit was found that the magnesium sulphate present in the water\r\nacted upon the calcium hydrate in the cement, forming calcium\r\nsulphate, and leaving the magnesium hydrate free. The calcium\r\nsulphate combines with the alumina of the cement, forming\r\ncalcium sulpho-aluminate, which causes swelling and cracking of\r\nthe concrete, and in cements containing a high proportion of\r\nalumina, leads to total destruction of all cohesion. The\r\nmagnesium hydrate has a tendency to fill the pores of the\r\nconcrete so as to make it more impervious to the destructive\r\naction of the sea-water, and disintegration may be retarded or\r\nchecked. A high proportion of magnesia has been found in\r\nsamples of cement which have failed under the action of sea\r\nwater, but the disastrous result cannot be attributed to this\r\nsubstance having been in excess in the original cement, as it\r\nwas probably due to the deposition of the magnesia salts from\r\nthe sea-water; although, if magnesia were present in the cement\r\nin large quantities, it would cause it to expand and crack,\r\nstill with the small proportion in which it occurs in ordinary\r\ncements it is probably inert. The setting of cement under the\r\naction of water always frees a portion of the lime which was\r\ncombined, but over twice as much is freed when the cement sets\r\nin sea-water as in fresh water. The setting qualities of cement\r\nare due to the iron and alumina combined with calcium, so that\r\nfor sea-coast work it is desirable for the alumina to be\r\nreplaced by iron as far as possible. The final hardening and\r\nstrength of cement is due in a great degree to the tri-calcium\r\nsilicate (3CaO, SiO2) which is soluble by the sodium chloride\r\nfound in sea-water, so that the resultant effect of the action\r\nof these two compounds is to enable the sea-water to gradually\r\npenetrate the mortar and rot the concrete. The concrete is\r\nsoftened, when there is an abnormal amount of sulphuric acid\r\npresent, as a result of the reaction of the sulphuric acid of\r\nthe salt dissolved by the water upon a part of the lime in the\r\ncement. The ferric oxide of the cement is unaffected by sea-\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe neat cement briquette tests showed that those immersed in\r\nsea-water attained a high degree of strength at a much quicker\r\nrate than those immersed in fresh water, but the 1 to 3 cement\r\nand sand briquette tests gave an opposite result. At the end of\r\ntwelve months, however, practically all the cements set in\r\nfresh water showed greater strength than those set in sea-\r\nwater. When briquettes which have been immersed in fresh water\r\nand have thoroughly hardened are broken, the cores are found to\r\nbe quite dry, and if briquettes immersed in sea-water show a\r\nsimilar dryness there need be no hesitation in using the\r\ncement; but if, on the other hand, the briquette shows that the\r\nsea-water has permeated to the interior, the cement will lose\r\nstrength by rotting until it has no cohesion at all. It must be\r\nremembered that it is only necessary for the water to penetrate\r\nto a depth of 1/2 in on each side of a briquette to render it\r\ndamp all through, whereas in practical work, if the water only\r\npenetrated to the same depth, very little ill-effect would be\r\nexperienced, although by successive removals of a skin 1/2 in\r\ndeep the structure might in time be imperilled.\r\n\r\nThe average strength in pounds per square inch of six different\r\nwell-known brands of cement tested by Mr. O'Hara was as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE No. 16.\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF SEA WATER ON STRENGTH OF CEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Neat cement         1 cement to 3 sand\r\n                        set in                 set in\r\n                 Sea Water  Fresh Water  Sea Water  Fresh Water\r\n\r\n 7 days             682        548          214        224\r\n28 days             836        643          293        319\r\n 2 months           913        668          313        359\r\n 3 months           861        667          301        387\r\n 6 months           634        654          309        428\r\n 9 months           542        687          317        417\r\n12 months           372        706          325        432\r\n\r\n\r\nSome tests were also made by Messrs. Westinghouse, Church,\r\nKerr, and Co., of New York, to ascertain the effect of sea-\r\nwater on the tensile strength of cement mortar. Three sets of\r\nbriquettes were made, having a minimum section of one square\r\ninch. The first were mixed with fresh water and kept in fresh\r\nwater; the second were mixed with fresh water, but kept\r\nimmersed in pans containing salt water; while the third were\r\nmixed with sea-water and kept in sea-water. In the experiments\r\nthe proportion of cement and sand varied from 1 to 1 to 1 to 6.\r\nThe results of the tests on the stronger mixtures are shown in\r\nFig. 32.\r\n\r\nThe Scandinavian Portland cement manufacturers have in hand\r\ntests on cubes of cement mortar and cement concrete, which were\r\nstarted in 1896, and are to extend over a period of twenty\r\nyears. A report upon the tests of the first ten years was\r\nsubmitted at the end of 1909 to the International Association\r\nof Testing Materials at Copenhagen, and particulars of them are\r\npublished in \"Cement and Sea-Water,\" by A. Poulsen (chairman of\r\nthe committee), J. Jorsen and Co., Copenhagen, 1909, price 3s.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Tests of the Tensile Strength of\r\nCement and Sand Briquettes, Showing the Effect of Sea Water.]\r\n\r\nCements from representative firms in different countries were\r\nobtained for use in making the blocks, which had coloured glass\r\nbeads and coloured crushed glass incorporated to facilitate\r\nidentification. Each block of concrete was provided with a\r\nnumber plate and a lifting bolt, and was kept moist for one\r\nmonth before being placed in position. The sand and gravel were\r\nobtained from the beach on the west coast of Jutland. The\r\nmortar blocks were mixed in the proportion of 1 to 1, 1 to 2,\r\nand 1 to 3, and were placed in various positions, some between\r\nhigh and low water, so as to be exposed twice in every twenty-\r\nfour hours, and others below low water, so as to be always\r\nsubmerged. The blocks were also deposited under these\r\nconditions in various localities, the mortar ones being placed\r\nat Esbjerb at the south of Denmark, at Vardo in the Arctic\r\nOcean, and at Degerhamm on the Baltic, where the water is only\r\none-seventh as salt as the North Sea, while the concrete blocks\r\nwere built up in the form of a breakwater or groyne at Thyboron\r\non the west coast of Jutland. At intervals of three, six, and\r\ntwelve months, and two, four, six, ten, and twenty years, some\r\nof the blocks have, or will be, taken up and subjected to\r\nchemical tests, the material being also examined to ascertain\r\nthe effect of exposure upon them. The blocks tested at\r\nintervals of less than one year after being placed in position\r\ngave very variable results, and the tests were not of much\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nThe mortar blocks between high and low water mark of the Arctic\r\nOcean at Vardo suffered the worst, and only those made with the\r\nstrongest mixture of cement, 1 to 1, withstood the severe frost\r\nexperienced. The best results were obtained when the mortar was\r\nmade compact, as such a mixture only allowed diffusion to take\r\nplace so slowly that its effect was negligible; but when, on\r\nthe other hand, the mortar was loose, the salts rapidly\r\npenetrated to the interior of the mass, where chemical changes\r\ntook place, and caused it to disintegrate. The concrete blocks\r\nmade with 1 to 3 mortar disintegrated in nearly every case,\r\nwhile the stronger ones remained in fairly good condition. The\r\nbest results were given by concrete containing an excess of\r\nvery fine sand. Mixing very finely-ground silica, or trass,\r\nwith the cement proved an advantage where a weak mixture was\r\nemployed, but in the other cases no benefit was observed.\r\n\r\nThe Association of German Portland Cement Manufacturers carried\r\nout a series of tests, extending over ten years, at their\r\ntesting station at Gross Lichterfeld, near Berlin, the results\r\nof which were tabulated by Mr. C. Schneider and Professor Gary.\r\nIn these tests the mortar blocks were made 3 in cube and the\r\nconcrete blocks l2 in cube; they were deposited in two tanks,\r\none containing fresh water and the other sea-water, so that the\r\neffect under both conditions might be noted. In addition,\r\nconcrete blocks were made, allowed to remain in moist sand for\r\nthree months, and were then placed in the form of a groyne in\r\nthe sea between high and low-water mark. Some of the blocks\r\nwere allowed to harden for twelve months in sand before being\r\nplaced, and these gave better results than the others. Two\r\nbrands of German Portland cement were used in these tests, one,\r\nfrom which the best results were obtained, containing 65.9 per\r\ncent. of lime, and the other 62.0 per cent. of lime, together\r\nwith a high percentage of alumina. In this case, also, the\r\naddition of finely-ground silica, or trass, improved the\r\nresisting power of blocks made with poor mortars, but did not\r\nhave any appreciable effect on the stronger mixtures.\r\n\r\nProfessor M. Möller, of Brunswick, Germany, reported to the\r\nInternational Association for Testing Materials, at the\r\nCopenhagen Congress previously referred to, the result of his\r\ntests on a small hollow, trapezium shape, reinforced concrete\r\nstructure, which was erected in the North Sea, the interior\r\nbeing filled with sandy mud, which would be easily removable by\r\nflowing water. The sides were 7 cm. thick, formed of cement\r\nconcrete 1:2 1/2:2, moulded elsewhere, and placed in the\r\nstructure forty days after they were made, while the top and\r\nbottom were 5 cm. thick, and consisted of concrete 1:3:3,\r\nmoulded _in situ_ and covered by the tide within twenty-four\r\nhours of being laid. The concrete moulded _in situ_ hardened a\r\nlittle at first, and then became soft when damp, and friable\r\nwhen dry, and white efflorescence appeared on the surface. In a\r\nshort time the waves broke this concrete away, and exposed the\r\nreinforcement, which rusted and disappeared, with the result\r\nthat in less than four years holes were made right through the\r\nconcrete. The sides, which were formed of slabs allowed to\r\nharden before being placed in the structure, were unaffected\r\nexcept for a slight roughening of the surface after being\r\nexposed alternately to the sea and air for a period, of\r\nthirteen years. Professor Möller referred also to several cases\r\nwhich had come under his notice where cement mortar or concrete\r\nbecame soft and showed white efflorescence when it had been\r\nbrought into contact with sea-water shortly after being made.\r\n\r\nIn experiments in Atlantic City samples of dry cement in powder\r\nform were put with sea-water in a vessel which was rapidly\r\nrotated for a short time, after which the cement and the sea-\r\nwater were analysed, and it was found that the sea-water had\r\ntaken up the lime from the cement, and the cement had absorbed\r\nthe magnesia salts from the sea-water.\r\n\r\nSome tests were carried out in 1908-9 at the Navy Yard,\r\nCharlestown, Mass., by the Aberthaw Construction Company of\r\nBoston, in conjunction with the Navy Department. The cement\r\nconcrete was placed so that the lower portions of the surfaces\r\nof the specimens were always below water, the upper portions\r\nwere always exposed to the air, and the middle portions were\r\nalternately exposed to each. Although the specimens were\r\nexposed to several months of winter frost as well as to the\r\nheat of the summer, no change was visible in any part of the\r\nconcrete at the end of six months.\r\n\r\nMons. R. Feret, Chief of the Laboratory of Bridges and Roads,\r\nBoulogne-sur-Mer, France, has given expression to the following\r\nopinions:--\r\n\r\n1. No cement or other hydraulic product has yet been found\r\nwhich presents absolute security against the decomposing action\r\nof sea-water.\r\n\r\n2. The most injurious compound of sea-water is the acid of the\r\ndissolved sulphates, sulphuric acid being the principal agent\r\nin the decomposition of cement.\r\n\r\n3. Portland cement for sea-water should be low in aluminium and\r\nas low as possible in lime.\r\n\r\n4. Puzzolanic material is a valuable addition to cement for\r\nsea-water construction,\r\n\r\n5. As little gypsum as possible should be added for regulating\r\nthe time of setting to cements which are to be used in sea-\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n6. Sand containing a large proportion of fine grains must never\r\nbe used in concrete or mortar for sea-water construction.\r\n\r\n7. The proportions of the cement and aggregate for sea-water\r\nconstruction must be such as will produce a dense and\r\nimpervious concrete.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, sea-water has very little chemical effect on good\r\nPortland cements, such as are now easily obtainable, and,\r\nprovided the proportion of aluminates is not too high, the\r\nvarying composition of the several well-known commercial\r\ncements is of little moment. For this reason tests on blocks\r\nimmersed in still salt water are of very little use in\r\ndetermining the probable behaviour of concrete when exposed to\r\ndamage by physical and mechanical means, such as occurs in\r\npractical work.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of concrete works on the sea coast is due to\r\nthe alternate exposure to air and water, frost, and heat, and\r\ntakes the form of cracking or scaling, the latter being the\r\nmost usual when severe frosts are experienced. When concrete\r\nblocks are employed in the construction of works, they should\r\nbe made as long as possible before they are required to be\r\nbuilt in the structure, and allowed to harden in moist sand,\r\nor, if this is impracticable, the blocks should be kept in the\r\nair and thoroughly wetted each day. On placing cement or\r\nconcrete blocks in sea water a white precipitate is formed on\r\ntheir surfaces, which shows that there is some slight chemical\r\naction, but if the mixture is dense this action is restricted\r\nto the outside, and does not harm the block.\r\n\r\nCement mixed with sea water takes longer to harden than if\r\nmixed with fresh water, the time varying in proportion to the\r\namount of salinity in the water. Sand and gravel from the\r\nbeach, even though dry, have their surfaces covered with saline\r\nmatters, which retard the setting of the cement, even when\r\nfresh water is used, as they become mixed with such water, and\r\nthus permeate the whole mass. If sea water and aggregate from\r\nthe shore are used, care must be taken to see that no decaying\r\nseaweed or other organic matter is mixed with it, as every such\r\npiece will cause a weak place in the concrete. If loam, clay,\r\nor other earthy matters from the cliffs have fallen down on to\r\nthe beach, the shingle must be washed before it is used in\r\nconcrete.\r\n\r\nExposure to damp air, such as is unavoidable on the coast,\r\nconsiderably retards the setting of cement, so that it is\r\ndesirable that it should not be further retarded by the\r\naddition of gypsum, or calcium sulphate, especially if it is to\r\nbe used with sea water or sea-washed sand and gravel. The\r\npercentage of gypsum found in cement is, however, generally\r\nconsiderably below the maximum allowed by the British Standard\r\nSpecification, viz., 2 per cent., and is so small that, for\r\npractical purposes, it makes very little difference in sea\r\ncoast work, although of course, within reasonable limits, the\r\nquicker the cement sets the better. When cement is used to\r\njoint stoneware pipe sewers near the coast, allowance must be\r\nmade for this retardation of the setting, and any internal\r\nwater tests which may be specified to be applied must not be\r\nmade until a longer period has elapsed after the laying of the\r\npipes than would otherwise be necessary. A high proportion of\r\naluminates tends to cause disintegration when exposed to sea\r\nwater. The most appreciable change which takes place in a good\r\nsound cement after exposure to the sea is an increase in the\r\nchlorides, while a slight increase in the magnesia and the\r\nsulphates also takes place, so that the proportion of sulphates\r\nand magnesia in the cement should be kept fairly low. Hydraulic\r\nlime exposed to the sea rapidly loses the lime and takes up\r\nmagnesia and sulphates.\r\n\r\nTo summarise the information upon this point, it appears that\r\nit is better to use fresh water for all purposes, but if, for\r\nthe sake of economy, saline matters are introduced into the\r\nconcrete, either by using sea water for mixing or by using sand\r\nand shingle from the beach, the principal effect will be to\r\ndelay the time of setting to some extent, but the ultimate\r\nstrength of the concrete will probably not be seriously\r\naffected. When the concrete is placed in position the portion\r\nmost liable to be destroyed is that between high and low water\r\nmark, which is alternately exposed to the action of the sea and\r\nthe air, but if the concrete has a well-graded aggregate, is\r\ndensely mixed, and contains not more than two parts of sand to\r\none part of cement, no ill-effect need be anticipated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nDIVING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe engineer is not directly concerned with the various methods\r\nemployed in constructing a sea outfall, such matters being left\r\nto the discretion of the contractor. It may, however, be\r\nbriefly stated that the work frequently involves the erection\r\nof temporary steel gantries, which must be very carefully\r\ndesigned and solidly built if they are to escape destruction by\r\nthe heavy seas. It is amazing to observe the ease with which a\r\nrough sea will twist into most fantastic shapes steel joists 10\r\nin by 8in, or even larger in size. Any extra cost incurred in\r\nstrengthening the gantries is well repaid if it avoids damage,\r\nbecause otherwise there is not only the expense of rebuilding\r\nthe structure to be faced, but the construction of the work\r\nwill be delayed possibly into another season.\r\n\r\nIn order to ensure that the works below water are constructed\r\nin a substantial manner, it is absolutely necessary that the\r\nresident engineer, at least, should be able to don a diving\r\ndress and inspect the work personally. The particular points to\r\nwhich attention must be given include the proper laying of the\r\npipes, so that the spigot of one is forced home into the socket\r\nof the other, the provision and tightening up of all the bolts\r\nrequired to be fixed, the proper driving of the piles and\r\nfixing the bracing, the dredging of a clear space in the bed of\r\nthe sea in front of the outlet pipe, and other matters\r\ndependent upon the special form of construction adopted. If a\r\nplug is inserted in the open end of the pipes as laid, the\r\nrising of the tide will press on the plugged end and be of\r\nconsiderable assistance in pushing the pipes home; it will\r\ntherefore be necessary to re-examine the joints to see if the\r\nbolts can be tightened up any more.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Siebe, Gorman, and Co., the well-known makers of\r\nsubmarine appliances, have fitted up at their works at\r\nWestminster Bridge-road, London, S.E., an experimental tank, in\r\nwhich engineers may make a few preliminary descents and be\r\ninstructed in the art of diving; and it is distinctly more\r\nadvantageous to acquire the knowledge in this way from experts\r\nthan to depend solely upon the guidance of the divers engaged\r\nupon the work which the engineer desires to inspect. Only a\r\nnominal charge of one guinea for two descents is made, which\r\nsum, less out-of-pocket expenses, is remitted to the Benevolent\r\nFund of the Institution of Civil Engineers. It is generally\r\ndesirable that a complete outfit, including the air pump,\r\nshould be provided for the sole use of the resident engineer,\r\nand special men should be told off to assist him in dressing\r\nand to attend to his wants while he is below water. He is then\r\nable to inspect the work while it is actually in progress, and\r\nhe will not hinder or delay the divers.\r\n\r\nIt is a wise precaution to be medically examined before\r\nundertaking diving work, although, with the short time which\r\nwill generally be spent below water, and the shallow depths\r\nusual in this class of work, there is practically no danger;\r\nbut, generally speaking, a diver should be of good physique,\r\nnot unduly stout, free from heart or lung trouble and varicose\r\nveins, and should not drink or smoke to excess. It is\r\nnecessary, however, to have acquaintance with the physical\r\nprinciples involved, and to know what to do in emergencies. A\r\nconsiderable amount of useful information is given by Mr. R. H.\r\nDavis in his \"Diving Manual\" (Siebe, Gorman, and Co., 5s.),\r\nfrom which many of the following notes are taken.\r\n\r\nA diving dress and equipment weighs about l75 lb, including a\r\n40 lb lead weight carried by the diver on his chest, a similar\r\nweight on his back, and l6lb of lead on each boot. Upon\r\nentering the water the superfluous air in the dress is driven\r\nout through the outlet valve in the helmet by the pressure of\r\nthe water on the legs and body, and by the time the top of the\r\ndiver's head reaches the surface his breathing becomes\r\nlaboured, because the pressure of air in his lungs equals the\r\natmospheric pressure, while the pressure upon his chest and\r\nabdomen is greater by the weight of the water thereon.\r\n\r\nHe is thus breathing against a pressure, and if he has to\r\nbreathe deeply, as during exertion, the effect becomes serious;\r\nso that the first thing he has to learn is to adjust the\r\npressure of the spring on the outlet valve, so that the amount\r\nof air pumped in under pressure and retained in the diving\r\ndress counterbalances the pressure of the water outside, which\r\nis equal to a little under 1/2lb per square inch for every foot\r\nin depth. If the diver be 6 ft tall, and stands in an upright\r\nposition, the pressure on his helmet will be about 3lb per\r\nsquare inch less than on his boots. The breathing is easier if\r\nthe dress is kept inflated down to the abdomen, but in this\r\ncase there is danger of the diver being capsized and floating\r\nfeet upwards, in which position he is helpless, and the air\r\ncannot escape by the outlet valve. Air is supplied to the diver\r\nunder pressure by an air pump through a flexible tube called\r\nthe air pipe; and a light rope called a life line, which is\r\nused for signalling, connects the man with the surface. The\r\ndescent is made by a 3 in \"shot-rope,\" which has a heavy sinker\r\nweighing about 50 lb attached, and is previously lowered to the\r\nbottom. A 1-1/4 in rope about 15 ft long, called a \"distance-\r\nline,\" is attached to the shot-rope about 3 ft above the\r\nsinker, and on reaching the bottom the diver takes this line\r\nwith him to enable him to find his way back to the shot-rope,\r\nand thus reach the surface comfortably, instead of being hauled\r\nup by his life line. The diver must be careful in his movements\r\nthat he does not fall so as suddenly to increase the depth of\r\nwater in which he is immersed, because at the normal higher\r\nlevel the air pressure in the dress will be properly balanced\r\nagainst the water pressure; but if he falls, say 30 ft, the\r\npressure of the water on his body will be increased by about 15\r\nlb per square inch, and as the air pump cannot immediately\r\nincrease the pressure in the dress to a corresponding extent,\r\nthe man's body in the unresisting dress will be forced into the\r\nrigid helmet, and he will certainly be severely injured, and\r\nperhaps even killed.\r\n\r\nWhen descending under water the air pressure in the dress is\r\nincreased, and acts upon the outside of the drum of the ear,\r\ncausing pain, until the air passing through the nose and up the\r\nEustachian tube inside the head reaches the back of the drum\r\nand balances the pressure. This may be delayed, or prevented,\r\nif the tube is partially stopped up by reason of a cold or\r\nother cause, but the balance can generally be brought about if\r\nthe diver pauses in his descent and swallows his saliva; or\r\nblocks up his nose as much as possible by pressing it against\r\nthe front of the helmet, closing the mouth and then making a\r\nstrong effort at expiration so as to produce temporarily an\r\nextra pressure inside the throat, and so blow open the tubes;\r\nor by yawning or going through the motions thereof. If this\r\ndoes not act he must come up again Provided his ears are\r\n\"open,\" and the air pumps can keep the pressure of air equal to\r\nthat of the depth of the water in which the diver may be, there\r\nis nothing to limit the rate of his descent.\r\n\r\nNow in breathing, carbonic acid gas is exhaled, the quality\r\nvarying in accordance with the amount of work done, from .014\r\ncubic feet per minute when at rest to a maximum of about .045,\r\nand this gas must be removed by dilution with fresh air so as\r\nnot to inconvenience the diver. This is not a matter of much\r\ndifficulty as the proportion in fresh air is about .03 per\r\ncent., and no effect is felt until the proportion is increased\r\nto about 0.3 per cent., which causes one to breathe twice as\r\ndeeply as usual; at 0.6 per cent. there is severe panting; and\r\nat a little over 1.0 per cent. unconsciousness occurs. The\r\neffect of the carbonic acid on the diver, however, increases\r\nthe deeper he descends; and at a depth of 33 ft 1 per cent. of\r\ncarbonic acid will have the same effect as 2 per cent. at the\r\nsurface. If the diver feels bad while under water he should\r\nsignal for more air, stop moving about, and rest quietly for a\r\nminute or two, when the fresh air will revive him. The volume\r\nof air required by the diver for respiration is about 1.5 cubic\r\nfeet per minute, and there is a non-return valve on the air\r\ninlet, so that in the event of the air pipe being broken, or\r\nthe pump failing, the air would not escape backwards, but by\r\nclosing the outlet valve the diver could retain sufficient air\r\nto enable him to reach the surface.\r\n\r\nDuring the time that a diver is under pressure nitrogen gas\r\nfrom the air is absorbed by his blood and the tissues of his\r\nbody. This does not inconvenience him at the time, but when he\r\nrises the gas is given off, so that if he has been at a great\r\ndepth for some considerable time, and comes up quickly, bubbles\r\nform in the blood and fill the right side of the heart with\r\nair, causing death in a few minutes. In less sudden cases the\r\nbubbles form in the brain or spinal cord, causing paralysis of\r\nthe legs, which is called divers' palsy, or the only trouble\r\nwhich is experienced may be severe pains in the joints and\r\nmuscles. It is necessary, therefore, that he shall come up by\r\nstages so as to decompress himself gradually and avoid danger.\r\nThe blood can hold about twice as much gas in solution as an\r\nequal quantity of water, and when the diver is working in\r\nshallow depths, up to, say, 30 ft, the amount of nitrogen\r\nabsorbed is so small that he can stop down as long as is\r\nnecessary for the purposes of the work, and can come up to the\r\nsurface as quickly as he likes without any danger. At greater\r\ndepths approximately the first half of the upward journey may\r\nbe done in one stage, and the remainder done by degrees, the\r\nlongest rest being made at a few feet below the surface.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the time limits in accordance with\r\nthe latest British Admiralty practice; the time under the water\r\nbeing that from leaving the surface to the beginning of the\r\nascent:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE No. l7.--DIVING DATA.\r\n\r\n                                    Stoppages in     Total time\r\n                                     minutes at      for ascent\r\nDepth in feet.

While ascending he\r\nshould exercise his muscles freely during the period of waiting\r\nat each stopping place, so as to increase the circulation, and\r\nconsequently the rate of deceleration.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of the works the location of the sea\r\noutfall will be clearly indicated by temporary features visible\r\nby day and lighted by night; but when completed its position\r\nmust be marked in a permanent manner. The extreme end of the\r\noutfall should be indicated by a can buoy similar to that shown\r\nin Fig. 33, made by Messrs. Brown, Lenox, and Co. (Limited),\r\nMilwall, London, E., which costs about £75, including a 20 cwt.\r\nsinker and 10 fathoms of chain, and is approved for the purpose\r\nby the Board of Trade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 33 CAN BUOY FOR MARKING OUTFALL SEWER.]\r\n\r\nIt is not desirable to fasten the chain to any part of the\r\noutfall instead of using a sinker, because at low water the\r\nslack of the chain may become entangled, which by preventing\r\nthe buoy from rising with the tide, will lead to damage; but a\r\nspecial pile may be driven for the purpose of securing the\r\nbuoy, at such a distance from the outlet that the chain will\r\nnot foul it. The buoy should be painted with alternate vertical\r\nstripes of yellow and green, and lettered \"Sewer Outfall\" in\r\nwhite letters 12 in deep.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that it is necessary for the plans and\r\nsections of outfall sewers and other obstructions proposed to\r\nbe placed in tidal waters to be submitted to the Harbour and\r\nFisheries Department of the Board of Trade for their approval,\r\nand no subsequent alteration in the works may be made without\r\ntheir consent being first obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE DISCHARGE OF SEA OUTFALL SEWERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe head which governs the discharge of a sea outfall pipe is\r\nmeasured from the surface of the sewage in the tank, sewer, or\r\nreservoir at the head of the outfall to the level of the sea.\r\nAs the sewage is run off the level of its surface is lowered,\r\nand at the same time the level of the sea is constantly varying\r\nas the tide rises and falls, so that the head is a variable\r\nfactor, and consequently the rate of discharge varies. A curve\r\nof discharge may be plotted from calculations according to\r\nthese varying conditions, but it is not necessary; and all\r\nrequirements will be met if the discharges under certain stated\r\nconditions are ascertained. The most important condition,\r\nbecause it is the worst, is that when the level of the sea is\r\nat high water of equinoctial spring tides and the reservoir is\r\npractically empty.\r\n\r\nSea water has a specific gravity of 1.027, and is usually taken\r\nas weighing 64.14 lb per cubic foot, while sewage may be taken\r\nas weighing 62.45 lb per cubic foot, which is the weight of\r\nfresh water at its maximum density. Now the ratio of weight\r\nbetween sewage and sea water is as 1 to 1.027, so that a column\r\nof sea water l2 inches in height requires a column of fresh\r\nwater 12.324, or say 12-1/3 in, to balance it; therefore, in\r\norder to ascertain the effective head producing discharge it\r\nwill be necessary to add on 1/3 in for every foot in depth of\r\nthe sea water over the centre of the outlet.\r\n\r\nThe sea outfall should be of such diameter that the contents of\r\nthe reservoir can be emptied in the specified time--say, three\r\nhours--while the pumps are working to their greatest power in\r\npouring sewage into the reservoir during the whole of the\r\nperiod; so that when the valves are closed the reservoir will\r\nbe empty, and its entire capacity available for storage until\r\nthe valves are again opened.\r\n\r\nTo take a concrete example, assume that the reservoir and\r\noutfall are constructed as shown in Fig. 34, and that it is\r\nrequired to know the diameter of outfall pipe when the\r\nreservoir holds 1,000,000 gallons and the whole of the pumps\r\ntogether, including any that may be laid down to cope with any\r\nincrease of the population in the future, can deliver 600,000\r\ngallons per hour. When the reservoir is full the top water\r\nlevel will be 43.00 O.D., but in order to have a margin for\r\ncontingencies and to allow for the loss in head due to entry of\r\nsewage into the pipe, for friction in passing around bends, and\r\nfor a slight reduction in discharging capacity of the pipe by\r\nreason of incrustation, it will be desirable to take the\r\nreservoir as full, but assume that the sewage is at the level\r\n31.00. The head of water in the sea measured above the centre\r\nof the pipe will be 21 ft, so that\r\n\r\n[*Math: $21 \\times 1/3$],\r\n\r\nor 7 in--say, 0.58 ft--must be added to the height of high\r\nwater, thus reducing the effective head from 31.00 - 10.00 =\r\n21.00 to 20.42 ft The quantity to be discharged will be\r\n\r\n[*Math: $\\frac{1,000,000 + (3 * 600,000)}{3}$]\r\n\r\n= 933,333 gallons per hour = 15,555 gallons per minute, or,\r\ntaking 6.23 gallons equal to 1 cubic foot, the quantity equals\r\n2,497 cubic feet per min Assume the required diameter to be 30\r\nin, then, by Hawksley's formula, the head necessary to produce\r\nvelocity =\r\n\r\n[*Math: $\\frac{Gals. per min^2}{215 \\times diameter in\r\ninches^4} = \\frac{15,555^2}{215 * 30^4}$]\r\n\r\n = 1.389 ft, and the head to overcome friction =\r\n\r\n[*Math: $\\frac{Gals. per min^2 \\times Length in yards}{240 *\r\ndiameter in inches^5} = \\frac{15,555^2 * 2042}{240 * 30^5}]\r\n\r\n= 84.719. Then 1.389 + 84.719 = 86.108--say, 86.11 ft; but the\r\nacutal head is 20.42 ft, and the flow varies approximately as\r\nthe square root of the head, so that the true flow will be\r\nabout\r\n\r\n[*Math: $15,555 * \\sqrt{\\frac{20.42}{86.11} = 7574.8$]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 34 DIAGRAM ILLUSTRATING CALCULATIONS FOR THE\r\nDISCHARGE OF SEA OUTFALLS]\r\n\r\n--say 7,575 gallons. But a flow of 15,555 gallons per minute is\r\nrequired, as it varies approximately as the fifth power of the\r\ndiameter, the requisite diameter will be about\r\n\r\n[*Math: \\sqrt[5]{\\frac{30^5 \\times 15,555}{7575}] = 34.64\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nNow assume a diameter of 40 in, and repeat the calculations.\r\nThen head necessary to produce velocity\r\n\r\n[*Math: = \\frac{15,555^2}{215 \\times 40^4}] = 0.044 ft, and\r\nhead to overcome friction =\r\n\r\n[*Math: \\frac{15,555^2 \\times 2042}{240 \\times 40^5}]\r\n\r\n= 20.104 ft Then 0.044 + 20.104 = 20.148, say 20.15 ft, and the\r\ntrue flow will therefore be about\r\n\r\n[*Math: 15,555 * \\sqrt{\\frac{20.42}{20.15}}]\r\n\r\n= 15,659 gallons, and the requisite diameter about\r\n\r\n[*Math: \\sqrt[5]{\\frac{40^5 * 15,555}{15,659}}]\r\n\r\n= 39.94 inches.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, a 30 in diameter pipe is assumed, a diameter\r\nof 34.64 in is shown to be required, and when 40 in is assumed\r\n39.94 in is indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet _a_ = difference between the two assumed diameters. _b_ =\r\nincrease found over lower diameter. _c_ = decrease found under\r\ngreater diameter. _d_ = lower assumed diameter.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen true diameter =\r\n\r\n[*Math: d + \\frac{ab}{b+c} = 30 + \\frac{10 \\times\r\n4.64}{4.64+0.06} = 30 + \\frac{46.4}{4.7} = 39.872],\r\n\r\nor, say, 40 in, which equals the required diameter.\r\n\r\nA simpler way of arriving at the size would be to calculate it\r\nby Santo Crimp's formula for sewer discharge, namely, velocity\r\nin feet per second =\r\n\r\n[*Math: 124 \\sqrt[3]{R^2} \\sqrt{S}],\r\n\r\nwhere R equals hydraulic mean depth in feet, and S = the ratio\r\nof fall to length; the fall being taken as the difference in\r\nlevel between the sewage and the sea after allowance has been\r\nmade for the differing densities. In this case the fall is\r\n20.42 ft in a length of 6,126 ft, which gives a gradient of 1\r\nin 300. The hydraulic mean depth equals\r\n\r\n[*Math: \\frac{d}{4}];\r\n\r\nthe required discharge, 2,497 cubic feet per min, equals the\r\narea,\r\n\r\n[*Math: (\\frac{\\pi d^2}{4})]\r\n\r\nmultiplied by the velocity, therefore the velocity in feet per\r\nsecond = 4/(pi d^2) x 2497/60 = 2497/(15 pi d^2) and the\r\nformula then becomes\r\n\r\n2497/(15 pi d^2) = 124 x * 3rd_root(d^2)/3rd_root(4^3*) x\r\nsqrt(1)/sqrt(300)\r\n\r\nor d^2 x 3rd_root(d^2) = 3rd_root(d^6) = (2497 x 3rd_root(16) x\r\nsqrt(300)) / (124 x 15 x 3.14159*)\r\n\r\nor (8 x log d)/3 = log 2497 + (1/3 x log 16) + (* x log 300) -\r\nlog 124 - log 15 - log 3.14159;\r\n\r\nor log d = 3/8 (3.397419 + 0.401373 + 1.238561 - 2.093422 -\r\n1.176091 - 0.497150) = 3/8 (1.270690) = 0.476509.\r\n\r\n* d = 2.9958* feet = 35.9496, say 36 inches.\r\n\r\nAs it happens, this could have been obtained direct from the\r\ntables where the discharge of a 36 in pipe at a gradient of 1\r\nin 300 = 2,506 cubic feet per minute, as against 2,497 cubic\r\nfeet required, but the above shows the method of working when\r\nthe figures in the tables do not agree with those relating to\r\nthe particular case in hand.\r\n\r\nThis result differs somewhat from the one previously obtained,\r\nbut there remains a third method, which we can now make trial\r\nof--namely, Saph and Schoder's formula for the discharge of\r\nwater mains, V = 174 3rd_root(R^2) x S^.51*. Substituting\r\nvalues similar to those taken previously, this formula can be\r\nwritten\r\n\r\n2497/(15 pi d^2) = 174 x 3rd_root(d_2)/3rd_root(4^2) x\r\n1^.51/300^.51\r\n\r\nor d^2 x 3rd_root(d^2) = 3rd_root(d^6) = (2497 x 3rd_root(16) x\r\n300^.51) / (174 x 15 x 3.14159)\r\n\r\nor* log d = 3/8 (3.397419 + 0.401373 + (54 x 2.477121) -\r\n2.240549 - 1.176091 - 0.497150) = 3/8 (1.222647) = 0.458493\r\n\r\n* d = 2.874* feet = 34.388 say 34 1/2 inches.\r\n\r\nBy Neville's general formula the velocity in feet per second =\r\n140 SQRT(RS)-11(RS)^(1/3) or, assuming a diameter of 37 inches,\r\n\r\n\r\nV = 140 X SQRT(37/(12 x 4) x 1/300) - 11 (37/(12x4x300))^(1/3)\r\n\r\n\r\n= 140 x SQRT(37/14400) - 11 (37/1440)^(1/3)\r\n\r\n= 7.09660 - 1.50656 = 5.59 feet per second.\r\n\r\nDischarge = area x velocity; therefore, the discharge in cubic\r\nfeet per minute\r\n\r\n= 5.59 x 60 x (3.14159 x 37^2)/(4*12^2) = 2504 compared with\r\n\r\n2,497 c.f.m, required, showing that if this formula is used the\r\npipe should be 37 in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe four formulæ, therefore, give different results, as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nHawksley = 40 in\r\nNeville = 37 in\r\nSanto Crimp = 36 in\r\nSaph and Schoder = 34-1/2 in\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the case would probably be met by\r\nconstructing the outfall 36 in in diameter.\r\n\r\nIt is very rarely desirable to fix a flap-valve at the end of a\r\nsea outfall pipe, as it forms a serious obstruction to the flow\r\nof the sewage, amounting, in one case the writer investigated,\r\nto a loss of eight-ninths of the available head; the head was\r\nexceptionally small, and the flap valve practically absorbed it\r\nall. The only advantage in using a flap valve occurs when the\r\npipe is directly connected with a tank sewer below the level of\r\nhigh water, in which case, if the sea water were allowed to\r\nenter, it would not only occupy space required for storing\r\nsewage, but it would act on the sewage and speedily start\r\ndecomposition, with the consequent emission of objectionable\r\nodours. If there is any probability of sand drifting over the\r\nmouth of the outfall pipe, the latter will keep free much\r\nbetter if there is no valve. Schemes have been suggested in\r\nwhich it was proposed to utilise a flap valve on the outlet so\r\nas to render the discharge of the sewage automatic. That is to\r\nsay, the sewage was proposed to be collected in a reservoir at\r\nthe head of, and directly connected to, the outfall pipe, at\r\nthe outlet end of which a flap valve was to be fixed. During\r\nhigh water the mouth of the outfall would be closed, so that\r\nsewage would collect in the pipes, and in the reservoir beyond;\r\nthen when the tide had fallen such a distance that its level\r\nwas below the level of the sewage, the flap valve would open,\r\nand the sewage flow out until the tide rose and closed the\r\nvalve. There are several objections to this arrangement. First\r\nof all, a flap valve under such conditions would not remain\r\nwatertight, unless it were attended to almost every day, which\r\nis, of course, impracticable when the outlet is below water. As\r\nthe valve would open when the sea fell to a certain level and\r\nremain open during the time it was below that level, the period\r\nof discharge would vary from, say, two hours at neap tides to\r\nabout four hours at springs; and if the two hours were\r\nsufficient, the four hours would be unnecessary. Then the\r\nsewage would not only be running out and hanging about during\r\ndead water at low tide, but before that time it would be\r\ncarried in one direction, and after that time in the other\r\ndirection; so that it would be spread out in all quarters\r\naround the outfall, instead of being carried direct out to sea\r\nbeyond chance of return, as would be the case in a well-\r\ndesigned scheme.\r\n\r\nWhen opening the valve in the reservoir, or other chamber, to\r\nallow the sewage to flow through the outfall pipe, care should\r\nbe taken to open it at a slow rate so as to prevent damage by\r\nconcussion when the escaping sewage meets the sea water\r\nstanding in the lower portion of the pipes. When there is\r\nconsiderable difference of level between the reservoir and the\r\nsea, and the valve is opened somewhat quickly, the sewage as it\r\nenters the sea will create a \"water-spout,\" which may reach to\r\na considerable height, and which draws undesirable attention to\r\nthe fact that the sewage is then being turned into the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV\r\n\r\nTRIGONOMETRICAL SURVEYING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the surveying work necessary to fix the positions of the\r\nvarious stations, and of the float, a few elementary\r\ntrigonometrical problems are involved which can be\r\nadvantageously explained by taking practical examples.\r\n\r\nHaving selected the main station A, as shown in Fig. 35, and\r\nmeasured the length of any line A B on a convenient piece of\r\nlevel ground, the next step will be to fix its position upon\r\nthe plan. Two prominent landmarks, C and D, such as church\r\nsteeples, flag-staffs, etc., the positions of which are shown\r\nupon the ordnance map, are selected and the angles read from\r\neach of the stations A and B. Assume the line A B measures ll7\r\nft, and the angular measurements reading from zero on that line\r\nare, from A to point C, 29° 23' and to point D 88° 43', and\r\nfrom B to point C 212° 43', and to point D 272° 18' 30\". The\r\nactual readings can be noted, and then the arrangement of the\r\nlines and angles sketched out as shown in Fig. 35, from which\r\nit will be necessary to find the lengths AC and AD. As the\r\nthree angles of a triangle equal 180°, the angle B C A = 180°-\r\n147° 17'-29° 23'= 3° 20', the angle B D A = 180°-87° 41' 30\"-\r\n88° 43'= 3° 35' 30\". In any triangle the sides are\r\nproportionate to the sines of the opposite angles, and vice\r\nversa; therefore,\r\n\r\nA B : A C :: sin B C A : sin A B C, or sin B C A : A B :: sin\r\nABC : A C, nr A C = (A B sin A B C) / (sin B C A) = (117 x sin\r\n147° 17') / (sin 3° 20')\r\n\r\nor log A C = log 117 + L sin 147° 17' - L sin 3° 20'.\r\n\r\nThe sine of an angle is equal to the sine of its supplement, so\r\nthat sin 147° 17' = sin 32° 43', whence log A C = 2.0681859 +\r\n9.7327837-8.7645111 = 3.0364585\r\n\r\nTherefore A C = 1087.6 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilarly sin B D A: A B :: sin A B D: A D\r\n\r\n                 A B sin A B D     117 x sin 87° 41' 30\"\r\ntherefore A D = --------------- = -----------------------\r\n                   sin B D A          sin 3° 35' 30\"\r\n\r\nwhence log A D = log ll7 +  L sin 87° 41' 30\" - L sin 3° 35' 30\"\r\n               = 2.0681859 + 9.99964745 - 8.79688775\r\n               = 3.2709456\r\n\r\nTherefore AD = 1866.15 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe length of two of the sides and all three angles of each of\r\nthe two triangles A C B and A D B are now known, so that the\r\ntriangles can be drawn upon the base A B by setting off the\r\nsides at the known angles, and the draughtsmanship can be\r\nchecked by measuring the other known side of each triangle. The\r\npoints C and D will then represent the positions of the two\r\nlandmarks to which the observations were taken, and if the\r\ntriangles are drawn upon a piece of tracing paper, and then\r\nsuperimposed upon the ordnance map so that the points C and D\r\ncorrespond with the landmarks, the points A and B can be\r\npricked through on to the map, and the base line A B drawn in\r\nits correct position.\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to draw the base line on the map direct from\r\nthe two known points, it will be necessary to ascertain the\r\nmagnitude of the angle A D C. Now, in any triangle the tangent\r\nof half the difference of two angles is to the tangent of half\r\ntheir sum as the difference of the two opposite sides is to\r\ntheir sum; that is:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Tan 1/2 (ACD - ADC): tan 1/2 (ACD + ADC)::\r\n      AD - AC : AD + AC,\r\n\r\n  but ACD + ADC = l80° - CAD = 120° 40',\r\n  therefore, tan 1/2 (ACD - ADC): tan 1/2 (120° 40')::\r\n         (1866.15 - 1087.6): (1866.15 + 1087.6),\r\n\r\n                                    778.55 tan 60° 20'\r\n  therefore, tan 1/2 (ACD - ADC) = --------------------\r\n                                         2953.75\r\n\r\n  or L tan 1/2 (ACD - ADC) = log 778.55 + L tan 60° 20'\r\n        - log 2953.75 .\r\n    = 2.8912865 + 10.2444l54 - 3.4703738\r\n    = 9.6653281 .. 1/2 (ACD - ADC) = 24° 49' 53\"\r\n    ..

Then the line A C should\r\nmeasure l087.6 ft long, and meet the line A D at the point A,\r\nmaking an angle of 59° 20'. From point A draw a line A B, ll7\r\nft long, making an angle of 29° 23' with the line A C; join B\r\nC, then the angle ABC should measure 147° 17', and the angle B\r\nC A 3° 20'. If the lines and angles are accurately drawn, which\r\ncan be proved by checking as indicated, the line A B will\r\nrepresent the base line in its correct position on the plan.\r\n\r\nThe positions of the other stations can be calculated from the\r\nreadings of the angles taken from such stations. Take stations\r\nE, F, G, and H as shown in Fig. 36*, the angles which are\r\nobserved being marked with an arc.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that two of the angles of each triangle are\r\nrecorded, so that the third is always known. The full lines\r\nrepresent those sides, the lengths of which are calculated, so\r\nthat the dimensions of two sides and the three angles of each\r\ntriangle are known. Starting with station E,\r\n\r\nSin A E D: A D:: sin D A E: D E\r\n\r\n       A D sin D A E\r\n D E = --------------\r\n        sin A E D\r\n\r\nor log D E = log A D + L sin D A E-L sin A E D.\r\n\r\nFrom station F, E and G are visible, but the landmark D cannot\r\nbe seen; therefore, as the latter can be seen from G, it will\r\nbe necessary to fix the position of G first. Then,\r\n\r\nsin E G D: D E :: sin E D G : E G,\r\n\r\n        D E sin E D G\r\nor EG= ---------------\r\n          sin E G D\r\n\r\nNow, sin E F G: E G :: sin F E G : F G\r\n\r\n        E G sin F E G\r\n  F G = -------------\r\n          sin E F G\r\n\r\nthus allowing the position of F to be fixed, and then\r\n\r\nsin F H G : F G :: sin F G H : F H\r\n\r\n       F G sin F G H\r\n  F H= -------------\r\n         sin F H G\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 36.--DIAGRAM ILLUSTRATING TRIGONOMETRICAL\r\nSURVEY OF OBSERVATION STATIONS.]\r\n\r\nIn triangles such as E F G and F G H all three angles can be\r\ndirectly read, so that any inaccuracy in the readings is at once\r\napparent. The station H and further stations along the coast being:\r\nout of sight of landmark D, it will be as well to connect the survey\r\nup with another landmark K, which can be utilised in the forward work;\r\nthe line K H being equal to\r\n\r\n\r\nF H sin K F H\r\n-------------\r\nsin F K H\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distance between C and D in Fig. 35 is calculated in a\r\nsimilar manner, because sin A C D : A D:: sin CAD : CD,\r\n\r\n\r\n          AD sin CAD     1866.15 sin 59° 20'\r\nor CD =   ----------  =  -------------------\r\n            sin SCD         sin 85° 9' 53\"\r\n\r\nor log CD = log 1866.15 + L sin 59° 20'  - L sin 85° 9' 53\"\r\n\r\n          = 3.2709456 + 9.9345738 - 9.9984516\r\n\r\n          = 3.2070678. ' . CD = 1610.90 ft\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distance between any two positions of the float can be\r\nobtained by calculation in a similar way to that in which the\r\nlength C D was obtained, but this is a lengthy process, and is\r\nnot necessary in practical work. It is desirable, of course,\r\nthat the positions of all the stations be fixed with the\r\ngreatest accuracy and plotted on the map, then the position of\r\nthe float can be located with sufficient correctness, if the\r\nlines of sight obtained from the angles read with the\r\ntheodolites are plotted, and their point of intersection marked\r\non the plan. The distance between any two positions of the\r\nfloat can be scaled from the plan.\r\n\r\nThe reason why close measurement is unnecessary in connection\r\nwith the positions of the float is that it represents a single\r\npoint, whereas the sewage escaping with considerable velocity\r\nfrom the outfall sewer spreads itself over a wide expanse of\r\nsea in front of the outlet, and thus has a tangible area. The\r\nvelocity of any current is greatest in the centre, and reduces\r\nas the distance from the centre increases, until the edges of\r\nthe current are lost in comparative still water; so that\r\nobservations taken of the course of one particle, such as the\r\nfloat represents, only approximately indicate the travel of the\r\nsewage through the sea. Another point to bear in mind is that\r\nthe dilution of the sewage in the sea is so great that it is\r\ngenerally only by reason of the unbroken fæcal, or other\r\nmatter, that it can be traced for any considerable distance\r\nbeyond the outfall. It is unlikely that such matters would\r\nreach the outlet, except in a very finely divided state, when\r\nthey would be rapidly acted upon by the sea water, which is a\r\nstrong oxidising agent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nHYDROGRAPHICAL SURVEYING.\r\n\r\n\r\nHydrographical surveying is that branch of surveying which\r\ndeals with the complete preparation of charts, the survey of\r\ncoast lines, currents, soundings, etc., and it is applied in\r\nconnection with the sewerage of sea coast towns when it is\r\nnecessary to determine the course of the currents, or a float,\r\nby observations taken from a boat to fixed points on shore, the\r\nboat closely following the float. It has already been pointed\r\nout that it is preferable to take the observations from the\r\nshore rather than the boat, but circumstances may arise which\r\nrender it necessary to adopt the latter course.\r\n\r\nIn the simplest case the position of the boat may be found by\r\ntaking the compass bearings of two known objects on shore. For\r\nexample, A and B in Fig. 37 may represent the positions of two\r\nprominent objects whose position is marked upon an ordnance map\r\nof the neighbourhood, or they may be flagstaffs specially set\r\nup and noted on the map; and let C represent the boat from\r\nwhich the bearings of A and B are taken by a prismatic compass,\r\nwhich is marked from 0 to 360°. Let the magnetic variation be\r\nN. 15° W., and the observed bearings A 290, B 320, then the\r\nposition stands as in Fig. 38, or, correcting for magnetic\r\nvariation, as in Fig. 39, from which it will be seen that the\r\ntrue bearing of C from A will be 275-180=95° East of North, or\r\n5° below the horizontal, and the true bearing of C from B will\r\nbe 305-180=120° East of North, or 35° below the horizontal.\r\nThese directions being plotted will give the position of C\r\nby their intersection. Fig. 40 shows the prismatic compass in\r\nplan and section. It consists practically of an ordinary compass\r\nbox with a prism and sight-hole at one side, and a corresponding\r\nsight-vane on the opposite side. When being used it is held\r\nhorizontally in the left hand with the prism turned up in the\r\nposition shown, and the sight-vane raised. When looking through\r\nthe sight-hole the face of the compass-card can be seen by\r\nreflection from the back of the prism, and at the same time the\r\ndirection of any required point may be sighted with the wire in the\r\nopposite sight vane, so that the bearing of the line between the\r\nboat and the required point may be read. If necessary, the\r\ncompass-card may be steadied by pressing the stop at the base of\r\nthe sight vane. In recording the bearings allowance must in all\r\ncases be made for the magnetic pole. The magnetic variation for\r\nthe year 1910 was about l5 1/2° West of North, and it is moving\r\nnearer to true North at the rate of about seven minutes per annum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--POSITION OF BOAT FOUND BY COMPASS\r\nBEARINGS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--REDUCTION OF BEARINGS TO MAGNETIC NORTH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--REDUCTION OF BEARINGS TO TRUE NORTH.]\r\n\r\nThere are three of Euclid's propositions that bear very closely\r\nupon the problems involved in locating the position of a\r\nfloating object with regard to the coast, by observations taken\r\nfrom the object. They are Euclid I. (32), \"The three interior\r\nangles of every triangle are together equal to two right\r\nangles\"; Euclid III. (20),\r\n\r\n\"The angle at the centre of a circle is double that of the\r\nangle at the circumference upon the same base--that is, upon\r\nthe same part of the circumference,\"\r\n\r\nor in other words, on a given chord the angle subtended by it\r\nat the centre of the circle is double the angle subtended by it\r\nat the circumference; and Euclid III. (21),\r\n\r\n\"The angles in the same segment of a circle are equal to one\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Fig. 40.--Section and Plan of Prismatic\r\nCompass.]\r\n\r\nHaving regard to this last proposition (Euclid III., 21), it\r\nwill be observed that in the case of Fig. 37 it would not have\r\nbeen possible to locate the point C by reading the angle A C B\r\nalone, as such point might be amywhere on the circumference of\r\na circle of which A B was the chord. The usual and more\r\naccurate method of determining the position of a floating\r\nobject from the object, itself, or from a boat alongside, is by\r\ntaking angles with a sextant, or box-sextant, between three\r\nfixed points on shore in two operations. Let A B C, Fig. 41, be\r\nthe three fixed points on shore, the positions of which are\r\nmeasured and recorded upon an ordnance map, or checked if they\r\nare already there. Let D be the floating object, the position\r\nof which is required to be located, and let the observed angles\r\nfrom the object be A D B 30° and B D C 45°. Then on the map\r\njoin A B and B C, from A and B set off angles = 90 - 30 = 60°,\r\nand they will intersect at point E, which will be the centre of\r\na circle, which must be drawn, with radius E A. The circle will\r\npass through A B, and the point D will be somewhere on its\r\ncircumference. Then from B and C set off angles = 90-45 = 45°,\r\nwhich will intersect at point F, which will be the centre of a\r\ncircle of radius F B, which will pass through points\r\nB C, and point D will be somewhere on the circumference of this\r\ncircle also; therefore the intersection of the two circles at D\r\nfixes that point on the map. It will be observed that the three\r\ninterior angles in the triangle A B E are together equal to two\r\nright angles (Euclid I. 32), therefore the angle A E B = 180 -\r\n2 x (90 - 30) = 600, so that the angle A E B is double the\r\nangle A D B (Euclid III., 20), and that as the angles\r\nsubtending a given chord from any point of the circumference\r\nare equal (Euclid III, 21), the point that is common to the two\r\ncircumferences is the required point. When point D is inked in,\r\nthe construction lines are rubbed out ready for plotting the\r\nobservations from the next position. When the floating point is\r\nout of range of A, a new fixed point will be required on shore\r\nbeyond C, so that B, C, and the new point will be used\r\ntogether. Another approximate method which may sometimes be\r\nemployed is to take a point on a piece of tracing paper and\r\ndraw from it three lines of unlimited length, which shall form\r\nthe two observed angles. If, now, this piece of paper is moved\r\nabout on top of the ordnance map until each of the three lines\r\npasses through the corresponding fixed points on shore, then the\r\npoint from which the lines radiate will represent the position of\r\nthe boat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Fig. 41. Geometrical Diagram for Locating\r\nObservation Point Afloat.]\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of a box-sextant is as shown in Fig. 42,\r\nand an enlarged diagrammatic plan of it is shown in Fig. 43. It\r\nis about 3 in in diameter, and is made with or without the\r\ntelescope; it is used for measuring approximately the angle\r\nbetween any two lines by observing poles at their extremities\r\nfrom the point of intersection. In Fig. 43, A is the sight-\r\nhole, B is a fixed mirror having one-half silvered and the\r\nother half plain; C is a mirror attached to the same pivot as\r\nthe vernier arm D. The side of the case is open to admit rays\r\nof light from the observed objects. In making an observation of\r\nthe angle formed by lines to two poles, one pole would be seen\r\nthrough the clear part of mirror B, and at the same time rays\r\nof light from the other pole would fall on to mirror C, which\r\nshould be moved until the pole is reflected on the silvered\r\npart of mirror B, exactly in line, vertically, with the pole\r\nseen by direct vision, then the angle between the two poles\r\nwould be indicated on the vernier. Take the case of a single\r\npole, then the angle indicated should be zero, but whether it\r\nwould actually be so depends upon circumstances which may be\r\nexplained as follows: Suppose the pole to be fixed at E, which\r\nis extremely close, it will be found that the arrow on the vernier\r\narm falls short of the zero of the scale owing to what may be\r\ncalled the width of the base line of the instrument. If the pole\r\nis placed farther off, as at F, the rays of light from the pole will\r\ntake the course of the stroke-and-dot line, and the vernier arm will\r\nrequire to be shifted nearer the zero of the scale. After a distance\r\nof two chains between the pole and sextant is reached, the rays of\r\nlight from the pole to B and C are so nearly parallel that the\r\nerror is under one minute, and the instrument can be used under\r\nsuch conditions without difficulty occurring by reason of\r\nerror. To adjust the box-sextant the smoked glass slide should\r\nbe drawn over the eyepiece, and then, if the sun is sighted, it\r\nshould appear as a perfect sphere when the vernier is at zero,\r\nin whatever position the sextant may be held. When reading the\r\nangle formed by the lines from two stations, the nearer station\r\nshould be sighted through the plain glass, which may\r\nnecessitate holding the instrument upside down. When the angle\r\nto be read between two stations exceeds 90°, an intermediate\r\nstation should be fixed, and the angle taken in two parts, as\r\nin viewing large angles the mirror C is turned round to such an\r\nextent that its own reflection, and that of the image upon it,\r\nis viewed almost edgeways in the mirror B.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Fig. 42.--Box-Sextant.]\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the box-sextant only reads angles in\r\nthe plane of the instrument, so that if one object sighted is\r\nlower than the other, the angle read will be the direct angle\r\nbetween them, and not the horizontal angle, as given by a\r\ntheodolite.\r\n\r\nThe same principles may be adopted for locating the position of\r\nan object in the water when the observations have to be taken\r\nat some distance from it. To illustrate this, use may be made\r\nof an examination question in hydrographical surveying given at\r\nthe Royal Naval College, Incidentally, it shows one method of\r\nrecording the observations. The question was as follows:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Fig. 43.--Diagram Showing Principle of Box-\r\nSextant]\r\n\r\n\"From Coastguard, Mound bore N. 77° W. (true) 0.45 of a mile,\r\nand Mill bore, N. 88° E, 0.56 of a mile, the following stations\r\nwere taken to fix a shoal on which the sea breaks too heavily to\r\nrisk the boat near:--\r\n\r\nMound 60° C.G. 47° Mill.\r\n[Greek:  phi]\r\nCentre of shoal\r\nMound 55° C.G. 57° 30' Mill.\r\n[Greek:  phi]\r\nCentre of shoal.\r\n\r\nProject the positions on a scale of 5 in = a mile, giving the\r\ncentre of the shoal.\" It should be noted that the sign [Greek:\r\nphi] signifies stations in one line or \"in transit,\" and C G\r\nindicates coastguard station. The order of lettering in Fig. 44\r\nshows the order of working.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  Fig. 44.--Method of Locating Point in Water\r\nWhen Observations Have to Be Taken Beyond It.]\r\n\r\nThe base lines A B and A C are set out from the lengths and\r\ndirections given; then, when the boat at D is \"in transit\" with\r\nthe centre of the shoal and the coastguard station, the angle\r\nformed at D by lines from that point to B and A is 60°, and the\r\nangle formed by lines to A and C is 47°. If angles of 90° - 60°\r\nare set up at A and B, their intersection at E will, as has\r\nalready been explained, give the centre of a circle which will\r\npass through points A, B, and D. Similarly, by setting up\r\nangles of 90°-47° at A and C, a circle is found which will pass\r\nthrough A C and D. The intersection of these circles gives the\r\nposition of the boat D, and it is known that the shoal is\r\nsituated somewhere in the straight line from D to A. The boat\r\nwas then moved to G, so as to be \"in transit\" with the centre\r\nof the shoal and the mound, and the angle B G A was found to be\r\n55°, and the angle A G C 57° 30'. By a similar construction to\r\nthat just described, the intersection of the circles will give\r\nthe position of G, and as the shoal is situated somewhere in\r\nthe line G B and also in the line A D, the intersection of\r\nthese two lines at K will give its exact position.\r\n\r\n\r\nAberdeen Sea Outfall\r\nAdmiralty, Diving Regulations of\r\n  --Charts, Datums for Soundings on\r\n  --Main Currents Shown on\r\nAge of Tide\r\nAir Pressure on Tides, Effect of\r\nAlmanac, Nautical\r\nAnalysis of Cement\r\n  --Sea Water\r\nAnchor Bolts for Sea Outfalls\r\nAnemometer for Measuring Wind\r\nAphelion\r\nApogee\r\nAtlantic Ocean, Tides in\r\nAutumnal Equinox\r\nBarometric Pressure, Effect on Tides of\r\nBeach Material, Use in Concrete of\r\nBeaufort Scale for Wind\r\nBench Mark for Tide Gauge\r\n\"Bird\" Tides\r\nBoard of Trade, Approval of Outfall by\r\nBolts for Sea Outfall Pipes\r\nBox Sextant\r\nBristol Channel\r\n  --Datum for Tides at\r\nBuoy for Marking Position of Outfall\r\nCan Buoy to Mark Position of Outfall\r\nCast Iron, Resistance to Sea Water of\r\nCement, Action of Sea Water on\r\n  --Analysis of\r\n  --Characteristics Causing Hardening of\r\n    --Setting of\r\n  --Effect of Saline Matters on Strength of\r\n    --Sea Water on Setting Time of\r\n  --Physical Changes Due to Action of Sea Water on\r\n  --Precautions in Marine Use of\r\n  --Retardation of Setting Time of\r\n  --Tests for Marine Use of\r\nCentrifugal Force, Effect on Tides of\r\nCentripetal Force, Effect on Tides of\r\n  --Variations in Intensity of\r\nCharts, Datum for Soundings on\r\n  --Main Currents Shown on\r\nChepstow, Greatest Tide at\r\nClifton, Tides at\r\nCompass, Magnetic Variation\r\n  --Marine\r\n  --Prismatic\r\nConcentration of Storm Water in Sewers\r\nConcrete, Action of Sea Water on\r\n  --Composition to Withstand Sea Water\r\n  --Destruction in Sea Water of\r\nCrown, Foreshore owned by\r\nCurrents and Tides.
