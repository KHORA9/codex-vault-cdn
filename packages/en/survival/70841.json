Notwithstanding its simple narrative style,\r\nas well as the absence of the supposedly indispensable _love_ motive,\r\nno modern book can boast of such world-wide esteem.\r\n\r\nWritten by Daniel Defoe and published in England in 1719 by William\r\nTaylor, the Life and Adventures won immediate popularity. Its\r\nphenomenal success called forth five reprintings in rapid succession.\r\nIn the following year came translations into French, German and Dutch,\r\nmarking the beginning of an unprecedented series of translations into\r\nmany other languages and dialects.\r\n\r\nAnd now, after two centuries, the story still stands secure and\r\nenduring--a monumental human document.\r\n\r\nHundreds of illustrated editions of The Life and Adventures of Robinson\r\nCrusoe have been published, and many more will follow, but I, like most\r\nillustrators enthusiastic in their work, have anticipated for years the\r\nopportunity which is now offered to me in the present edition.\r\n\r\nThe outstanding appeal of this fascinating romance to me personally is\r\nthe remarkably sustained sensation one enjoys of Crusoe’s contact with\r\nthe elements--the sea and the sun, the night and the storms, the sand,\r\nrocks, vegetation and animal life. In few books can the reader breathe,\r\nlive and move with his hero so intensely, so easily and so consistently\r\nthroughout the narrative. In Robinson Crusoe we have it; here is a\r\nstory that becomes history, history living and moving, carrying with it\r\nirresistibly the compelling motive of a lone man’s conquest over what\r\nseems to be inexorable Fate.\r\n\r\nDo my pictures add a little to the vividness of this story? Do I aid\r\na little in the clearer vizualization of Robinson Crusoe as he moves\r\nabout on his sunny island? That is the most I can hope for.\r\n\r\n                                                          N. C.

He got a good estate by merchandise, and leaving\r\noff his trade, lived afterward at York, from whence he had married my\r\nmother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very good family in that\r\ncountry, and from whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but by the\r\nusual corruption of words in England we are now called, nay, we call\r\nourselves, and write our name, Crusoe, and so my companions always\r\ncalled me.\r\n\r\nI had two elder brothers, one of which was lieutenant-colonel to an\r\nEnglish regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous\r\nColonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the\r\nSpaniards; what became of my second brother I never knew, any more than\r\nmy father and mother did know what was become of me.\r\n\r\nBeing the third son of the family, and not bred to any trade, my head\r\nbegan to be filled very early with rambling thoughts. My father, who\r\nwas very old, had given me a competent share of learning, as far as\r\nhouse-education and a country free school generally goes, and designed\r\nme for the law; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to\r\nsea; and my inclination to this led me so strongly against the will,\r\nnay, the commands, of my father, and against all the entreaties and\r\npersuasions of my mother and other friends, that there seemed to be\r\nsomething fatal in that propension of nature tending directly to the\r\nlife of misery which was to befall me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and\r\nexcellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design_”]\r\n\r\nMy father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent counsel\r\nagainst what he foresaw was my design. He called me one morning into\r\nhis chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated very\r\nwarmly with me upon this subject. He asked me what reasons more than a\r\nmere wandering inclination I had for leaving my father’s house and my\r\nnative country, where I might be well introduced, and had a prospect of\r\nraising my fortunes by application and industry, with a life of ease\r\nand pleasure. He told me it was for men of desperate fortunes on one\r\nhand, or of aspiring, superior fortunes on the other, who went abroad\r\nupon adventures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves famous in\r\nundertakings of a nature out of the common road; that these things were\r\nall either too far above me, or too far below me; that mine was the\r\nmiddle state or what might be called the upper station of low life,\r\nwhich he had found by long experience was the best state in the world,\r\nthe most suited to human happiness, not exposed to the miseries and\r\nhardships, the labor and sufferings, of the mechanic part of mankind,\r\nand not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy of the\r\nupper part of mankind. He told me I might judge of the happiness of\r\nthis state by this one thing, viz., that this was the state of life\r\nwhich all other people envied; that kings have frequently lamented the\r\nmiserable consequences of being born to great things, and wished they\r\nhad been placed in the middle of the two extremes, between the mean and\r\nthe great; that the wise man gave his testimony to this as the just\r\nstandard of true felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty nor\r\nriches.\r\n\r\nHe bid me observe it, and I should always find, that the calamities\r\nof life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind; but\r\nthat the middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed\r\nto so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind. Nay,\r\nthey were not subjected to so many distempers and uneasiness either\r\nof body or mind as those were who, by vicious living, luxury, and\r\nextravagances on one hand, or by hard labor, want of necessaries, and\r\nmean or insufficient diet on the other hand, bring distempers upon\r\nthemselves by the natural consequences of their way of living; that\r\nthe middle station of life was calculated for all kind of virtues\r\nand all kind of enjoyments; that peace and plenty were the handmaids\r\nof a middle fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness, health,\r\nsociety, all agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were\r\nthe blessings attending the middle station of life; that this way men\r\nwent silently and smoothly through the world, and comfortably out of\r\nit, not embarrassed with the labors of the hands or of the head, not\r\nsold to the life of slavery for daily bread, or harassed with perplexed\r\ncircumstances, which rob the soul of peace, and the body of rest; not\r\nenraged with the passion of envy, or secret burning lust of ambition\r\nfor great things; but in easy circumstances sliding gently through the\r\nworld, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living, without the bitter,\r\nfeeling that they are happy, and learning by every day’s experience to\r\nknow it more sensibly.\r\n\r\nAfter this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate\r\nmanner, not to play the young man, not to precipitate myself into\r\nmiseries which Nature and the station of life I was born in seemed to\r\nhave provided against; that I was under no necessity of seeking my\r\nbread; that he would do well for me, and endeavor to enter me fairly\r\ninto the station of life which he had been just recommending to me;\r\nand that if I was not very easy and happy in the world it must be my\r\nmere fate or fault that must hinder it, and that he should have nothing\r\nto answer for, having thus discharged his duty in warning me against\r\nmeasures which he knew would be to my hurt; in a word, that as he would\r\ndo very kind things for me if I would stay and settle at home as he\r\ndirected, so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes, as to\r\ngive me any encouragement to go away. And to close all, he told me\r\nI had my elder brother for an example, to whom he had used the same\r\nearnest persuasions to keep him from going into the Low Country wars,\r\nbut could not prevail, his young desires prompting him to run into\r\nthe army, where he was killed; and though he said he would not cease\r\nto pray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did take\r\nthis foolish step, God would not bless me, and I would have leisure\r\nhereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there\r\nmight be none to assist in my recovery.\r\n\r\nI observed in this last part of his discourse, which was truly\r\nprophetic, though I suppose my father did not know it to be so\r\nhimself--I say, I observed the tears run down his face very\r\nplentifully, and especially when he spoke of my brother who was killed;\r\nand that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent, and none to\r\nassist me, he was so moved, that he broke off the discourse, and told\r\nme, his heart was so full he could say no more to me.\r\n\r\nI was sincerely affected with this discourse, as, indeed, who could be\r\notherwise; and I resolved not to think of going abroad any more, but to\r\nsettle at home according to my father’s desire.\r\n\r\nBut alas! a few days wore it all off; and, in short, to prevent any of\r\nmy father’s farther importunities, in a few weeks after I resolved to\r\nrun quite away from him. However, I did not act so hastily neither as\r\nmy first heat of resolution prompted, but I took my mother, at a time\r\nwhen I thought her a little pleasanter than ordinary, and told her,\r\nthat my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the world, that I\r\nshould never settle to anything with resolution enough to go through\r\nwith it, and my father had better give me his consent than force me to\r\ngo without it; that I was now eighteen years old, which was too late to\r\ngo apprentice to a trade, or clerk to an attorney; that I was sure if I\r\ndid, I should never serve out my time, and I should certainly run away\r\nfrom my master before my time was out, and go to sea; and if she would\r\nspeak to my father to let me go but one voyage abroad, if I came home\r\nagain and did not like it, I would go no more, and I would promise by a\r\ndouble diligence to recover that time I had lost.\r\n\r\nThis put my mother into a great passion. She told me, she knew it would\r\nbe to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject; that he\r\nknew too well what was my interest to give his consent to anything so\r\nmuch for my hurt, and that she wondered how I could think of any such\r\nthing after such a discourse as I had had with my father, and such kind\r\nand tender expressions as she knew my father had used to me; and that,\r\nin short, if I would ruin myself there was no help for me; but I might\r\ndepend I should never have their consent to it; that for her part, she\r\nwould not have so much hand in my destruction, and I should never have\r\nit to say that my mother was willing when my father was not.\r\n\r\nThough my mother refused to move it to my father, yet, as I have heard\r\nafterwards, she reported all the discourse to him, and that my father,\r\nafter showing a great concern at it, said to her with a sigh, “That boy\r\nmight be happy if he would stay at home, but if he goes abroad he will\r\nbe the miserablest wretch that was ever born: I can give no consent to\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nIt was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose, though in\r\nthe meantime I continued obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling\r\nto business, and frequently expostulating with my father and mother\r\nabout their being so positively determined against what they knew my\r\ninclinations prompted me to. But being one day at Hull, where I went\r\ncasually, and without any purpose of making an elopement that time;\r\nbut I say, being there, and one of my companions being going by sea to\r\nLondon, in his father’s ship, and prompting me to go with them, with\r\nthe common allurement of seafaring men, viz., that it should cost me\r\nnothing for my passage, I consulted neither father nor mother any more,\r\nnor so much as sent them word of it; but leaving them to hear of it as\r\nthey might, without asking God’s blessing, or my father’s, without any\r\nconsideration of circumstances or consequences, and in an ill hour, God\r\nknows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n_First Adventures at Sea--Experience of a Maritime Life--Voyage to\r\nGuinea_\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of September, 1651, I went on board a ship bound for London.\r\nNever any young adventurer’s misfortunes, I believe, began sooner,\r\nor continued longer than mine. The ship was no sooner gotten out of\r\nthe Humber, but the wind began to blow, and the waves to rise in a\r\nmost frightful manner; and as I had never been at sea before, I was\r\nmost inexpressibly sick in body, and terrified in my mind. I began\r\nnow seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how justly I was\r\novertaken by the judgment of heaven for my wickedness in leaving my\r\nfather’s house, and abandoning my duty; all the good counsel of my\r\nparents, my father’s tears and my mother’s entreaties, came now fresh\r\ninto my mind, and my conscience, which was not yet come to the pitch of\r\nhardness which it has been since, reproached me with the contempt of\r\nadvice, and the breach of my duty to God and my father.\r\n\r\nAll this while the storm increased, and the sea, which I had never\r\nbeen upon before, went very high, though nothing like what I have\r\nseen many times since; no, nor like what I saw a few days after. But\r\nit was enough to affect me then, who was but a young sailor, and had\r\nnever known anything of the matter. I expected every wave would have\r\nswallowed us up, and that every time the ship fell down, as I thought,\r\nin the trough or hollow of the sea, we should never rise more; and in\r\nthis agony of mind I made many vows and resolutions, that if it would\r\nplease God here to spare my life this one voyage, if ever I once got\r\nmy foot upon dry land again, I would go directly home to my father,\r\nand never set it into a ship again while I lived; that I would take\r\nhis advice, and never run myself into such miseries as these any more.\r\nNow I saw plainly the goodness of his observations about the middle\r\nstation of life, how easy, how comfortably he had lived all his days,\r\nand never had been exposed to tempests at sea, or troubles on shore;\r\nand I resolved that I would, like a true repenting prodigal, go home to\r\nmy father.\r\n\r\nThese wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the storm\r\ncontinued, and indeed some time after; but the next day the wind\r\nwas abated and the sea calmer, and I began to be a little inured to\r\nit. However, I was very grave for all that day, being also a little\r\nsea-sick still; but towards night the weather cleared up, the wind was\r\nquite over, and a charming fine evening followed; the sun went down\r\nperfectly clear, and rose so the next morning; and having little or no\r\nwind, and a smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was, as I\r\nthought, the most delightful that ever I saw.\r\n\r\nI had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick but very\r\ncheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that was so rough and\r\nterrible the day before, and could be so calm and so pleasant in so\r\nlittle time after. And now lest my good resolutions should continue,\r\nmy companion, who had indeed enticed me away, came to me: “Well, Bob,”\r\nsaid he, clapping me on the shoulder, “how do you do after it? I\r\nwarrant you were frightened, wa’n’t you, last night, when it blew but a\r\ncapful of wind?” “A capful, d’you call it?” said I; “’twas a terrible\r\nstorm.” “A storm, you fool you,” replied he; “do you call that a storm?\r\nWhy, it was nothing at all; give us but a good ship and sea-room, and\r\nwe think nothing of such a squall of wind as that; but you’re but a\r\nfresh-water sailor, Bob. Come, let us make a bowl of punch, and we’ll\r\nforget all that; d’ye see what charming weather ’tis now?” To make\r\nshort this sad part of my story, we went the old way of all sailors;\r\nthe punch was made, and I was made drunk with it, and in that one\r\nnight’s wickedness I drowned all my repentance, all my reflections upon\r\nmy past conduct, and all my resolutions for my future. In a word, as\r\nthe sea was returned to its smoothness of surface and settled calmness\r\nby the abatement of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being over,\r\nmy fears and apprehensions of being swallowed up by the sea being\r\nforgotten, and the current of my former desires returned, I entirely\r\nforgot the vows and promises that I made in my distress. I found\r\nindeed some intervals of reflection, and the serious thoughts did, as\r\nit were, endeavor to return again sometimes; but I shook them off,\r\nand roused myself from them as it were from a distemper, and applying\r\nmyself to drink and company, soon mastered the return of those fits,\r\nfor so I called them, and I had in five or six days got as complete a\r\nvictory over conscience as any young fellow that resolved not to be\r\ntroubled with it could desire. But I was to have another trial for it\r\nstill; and Providence, as in such cases generally it does, resolved\r\nto leave me entirely without excuse. For if I would not take this for\r\na deliverance, the next was to be such a one as the worst and most\r\nhardened wretch among us would confess both the danger and the mercy.\r\n\r\nThe sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth Roads; the wind\r\nhaving been contrary and the weather calm, we had made but little way\r\nsince the storm. Here we were obliged to come to an anchor, and here we\r\nlay, the wind continuing contrary, viz., at south-west, for seven or\r\neight days, during which time a great many ships from Newcastle came\r\ninto the same roads, as the common harbor where the ships might wait\r\nfor a wind for the river.\r\n\r\nWe had not, however, rid here so long, but should have tided it up the\r\nriver, but that the wind blew too fresh; and after we had lain four or\r\nfive days, blew very hard. However, the roads being reckoned as good as\r\na harbor, the anchorage good, and our ground-tackle very strong, our\r\nmen were unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of danger, but\r\nspent the time in rest and mirth, after the manner of the sea; but the\r\neighth day in the morning the wind increased, and we had all hands at\r\nwork to strike our top-masts, and make everything snug and close, that\r\nthe ship might ride as easy as possible. By noon the sea went very high\r\nindeed, and our ship rid forecastle in, shipped several seas, and we\r\nthought once or twice our anchor had come home; upon which our master\r\nordered out the sheet-anchor, so that we rode with two anchors ahead,\r\nand the cables veered out to the bitter end.\r\n\r\nBy this time it blew a terrible storm indeed, and now I began to see\r\nterror and amazement in the faces even of the seamen themselves. The\r\nmaster, though vigilant to the business of preserving the ship, yet\r\nas he went in and out of his cabin by me, I could hear him softly to\r\nhimself say several times, “Lord be merciful to us, we shall be all\r\nlost, we shall be all undone”; and the like. During these first hurries\r\nI was stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in the steerage, and\r\ncannot describe my temper; I could ill re-assume the first penitence,\r\nwhich I had so apparently trampled upon, and hardened myself against; I\r\nthought the bitterness of death had been past, and that this would be\r\nnothing too, like the first. But when the master himself came by me,\r\nas I said just now, and said we should be all lost, I was dreadfully\r\nfrightened; I got up out of my cabin, and looked out. But such a dismal\r\nsight I never saw; the sea went mountains high, and broke upon us every\r\nthree or four minutes; when I could look about, I could see nothing\r\nbut distress round us. Two ships that rode near us we found had cut\r\ntheir masts by the board, being deep laden; and our men cried out,\r\nthat a ship which rode about a mile ahead of us was foundered. Two\r\nmore ships being driven from their anchors, were run out of the roads\r\nto sea at all adventures, and that with not a mast standing. The light\r\nships fared the best, as not so much laboring in the sea; but two or\r\nthree of them drove, and came close by us, running away with only their\r\nsprit-sail out before the wind.\r\n\r\nToward evening the mate and boatswain begged the master of our ship\r\nto let them cut away the fore-mast, which he was very unwilling to.\r\nBut the boatswain protesting to him that if he did not the ship would\r\nfounder, he consented; and when they had cut away the fore-mast, the\r\nmain-mast stood so loose, and shook the ship so much, they were obliged\r\nto cut her away also, and make a clear deck.\r\n\r\nAny one may judge what a condition I must be in at all this, who was\r\nbut a young sailor, and who had been in such a fright before at but\r\na little. But if I can express at this distance the thoughts I had\r\nabout me at that time, I was in tenfold more horror of mind upon\r\naccount of my former convictions, and the having returned from them\r\nto the resolutions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was at death\r\nitself; and these, added to the terror of the storm, put me into such\r\na condition, that I can by no words describe it. But the worst was\r\nnot come yet; the storm continued with such fury, that the seamen\r\nthemselves acknowledged they had never known a worse.\r\n\r\nWe had a good ship, but she was deep laden, and wallowed in the sea,\r\nthat the seamen every now and then cried out she would founder. It was\r\nmy advantage in one respect, that I did not know what they meant by\r\nfounder till I inquired.\r\n\r\nHowever, the storm was so violent, that I saw what is not often seen,\r\nthe master, the boatswain, and some others more sensible than the rest,\r\nat their prayers, and expecting every moment that the ship would go\r\nto the bottom. In the middle of the night, and under all the rest of\r\nour distresses, one of the men that had been down on the purpose to\r\nsee cried out we had sprung a leak; another said there was four foot\r\nof water in the hold. Then all hands were called to the pump. At that\r\nvery word my heart, as I thought, died within me, and I fell backwards\r\nupon the side of my bed where I sat, into the cabin. However, the men\r\nroused me, and told me, that I, that was able to do nothing before, was\r\nas well able to pump as another; at which I stirred up and went to the\r\npump and worked very heartily. While this was doing, the master seeing\r\nsome light colliers, who, not able to ride out the storm, were obliged\r\nto slip and run away to sea, and would come near us, ordered to fire\r\na gun as a signal of distress. I, who knew nothing what that meant,\r\nwas so surprised that I thought the ship had broke, or some dreadful\r\nthing had happened. In a word, I was so surprised that I fell down in a\r\nswoon. As this was a time when everybody had his own life to think of,\r\nnobody minded me, or what was become of me; but another man stepped up\r\nto the pump, and thrusting me aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking\r\nI had been dead; and it was a great while before I came to myself.\r\n\r\nWe worked on, but the water increasing in the hold, it was apparent\r\nthat the ship would founder, and though the storm began to abate a\r\nlittle, yet as it was not possible she could swim till we might run\r\ninto a port, so the master continued firing guns for help; and a light\r\nship, who had rid it out just ahead of us, ventured a boat out to help\r\nus. It was with the utmost hazard the boat came near us, but it was\r\nimpossible for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie near the\r\nship’s side, till at last the men rowing very heartily, and venturing\r\ntheir lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope over the stern with\r\na buoy to it, and then veered it out a great length, which they after\r\ngreat labor and hazard took hold of, and we hauled them close under\r\nour stern, and got all into their boat. It was to no purpose for them\r\nor us after we were in the boat to think of reaching to their own ship,\r\nso all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards shore\r\nas much as we could, and our master promised them that if the boat was\r\nstaved upon shore he would make it good to their master; so partly\r\nrowing and partly driving, our boat went away to the norward, sloping\r\ntowards the shore almost as far as Winterton Ness.\r\n\r\nWe were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship but\r\nwe saw her sink, and then I understood for the first time what was\r\nmeant by a ship foundering in the sea. I must acknowledge I had hardly\r\neyes to look up when the seamen told me she was sinking; for from that\r\nmoment they rather put me into the boat than that I might be said to go\r\nin; my heart was as it were dead within me, partly with fright, partly\r\nwith horror of mind and the thoughts of what was yet before me.\r\n\r\nWhile we were in this condition, the men yet laboring at the oar to\r\nbring the boat near the shore, we could see, when, our boat mounting\r\nthe waves, we were able to see the shore, a great many people running\r\nalong the shore to assist us when we should come near. But we made\r\nbut slow way towards the shore, nor were we able to reach the shore,\r\ntill being past the lighthouse at Winterton, the shore falls off to\r\nthe westward towards Cromer, and so the land broke off a little the\r\nviolence of the wind. Here we got in, and though not without much\r\ndifficulty got all safe on shore, and walked afterwards on foot to\r\nYarmouth, where, as unfortunate men, we were used with great humanity\r\nas well by the magistrates of the town, who assigned us good quarters,\r\nas by particular merchants and owners of ships, and had money given us\r\nsufficient to carry us either to London or back to Hull, as we thought\r\nfit.\r\n\r\nHad I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull and have gone home,\r\nI had been happy, and my father, an emblem of our blessed Savior’s\r\nparable, had even killed the fatted calf for me; for hearing the ship\r\nI went away in was cast away in Yarmouth Road, it was a great while\r\nbefore he had any assurance that I was not drowned.\r\n\r\nBut my ill-fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that nothing could\r\nresist; and though I had several times loud calls from my reason and my\r\nmore composed judgment to go home, yet I had no power to do it. I know\r\nnot what to call this, nor will I urge that it is a secret overruling\r\ndecree that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own destruction,\r\neven though it be before us, and that we rush upon it with our eyes\r\nopen. Certainly nothing but some such decreed unavoidable misery\r\nattending, and which it was impossible for me to escape, could have\r\npushed me forward against the calm reasonings and persuasions of my\r\nmost retired thoughts, and against two such visible instructions as I\r\nhad met with in my first attempt.\r\n\r\nMy comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and who was the\r\nmaster’s son, was now less forward than I. The first time he spoke to\r\nme after we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days, for\r\nwe were separated in the town to several quarters--I say, the first\r\ntime he saw me, it appeared his tone was altered, and looking very\r\nmelancholy and shaking his head, asked me how I did, and telling his\r\nfather who I was, and how I had come this voyage only for a trial in\r\norder to get farther abroad, his father turning to me with a very grave\r\nand concerned tone, “Young man,” said he, “you ought never to go to sea\r\nany more, you ought to take this for a plain and visible token, that\r\nyou are not to be a seafaring man.” “Why, sir,” said I, “will you go\r\nto sea no more?” “That is another case,” said he; “it is my calling,\r\nand therefore, my duty; but as you made this voyage for a trial, you\r\nsee what a taste Heaven has given you of what you are to expect if you\r\npersist; perhaps this is all befallen us on your account, like Jonah in\r\nthe ship of Tarshish. Pray,” continued he, “what are you? and on what\r\naccount did you go to sea?” Upon that I told him some of my story, at\r\nthe end of which he burst out with a strange kind of passion. “What\r\nhad I done,” said he, “that such an unhappy wretch should come into\r\nmy ship? I would not set my foot in the same ship with thee again for\r\na thousand pounds.” This indeed was, as I said, an excursion of his\r\nspirits, which were yet agitated by the sense of his loss, and was\r\nfarther than he could have authority to go. However, he afterwards\r\ntalked very gravely to me, exhorted me to go back to my father, and\r\nnot tempt Providence to my ruin; told me I might see a visible hand\r\nof Heaven against me. “And, young man,” said he, “depend upon it, if\r\nyou do not go back, wherever you go you will meet with nothing but\r\ndisasters and disappointments, till your father’s words are fulfilled\r\nupon you.”\r\n\r\nWe parted soon after; for I made him little answer, and I saw him no\r\nmore; which way he went, I know not. As for me, having some money in\r\nmy pocket, I travelled to London by land; and there, as well as on the\r\nroad, had many struggles with myself what course of life I should take,\r\nand whether I should go home, or go to sea.\r\n\r\nAs to going home, shame opposed the best motions that offered to my\r\nthoughts; and it immediately occurred to me how I should be laughed at\r\namong the neighbors, and should be ashamed to see, not my father and\r\nmother only, but even everybody else; from whence I have since often\r\nobserved how incongruous and irrational the common temper of mankind\r\nis, especially of youth, to that reason which ought to guide them in\r\nsuch cases, viz., that they are not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed\r\nto repent; not ashamed of the action for which they ought justly to be\r\nesteemed fools, but are ashamed of the returning, which only can make\r\nthem be esteemed wise men.\r\n\r\nIn this state of life, however, I remained some time, uncertain what\r\nmeasures to take, and what course of life to lead. An irresistible\r\nreluctance continued to going home; and as I stayed a while, the\r\nremembrance of the distress I had been in wore off; and as that abated,\r\nthe little motion I had in my desires to return wore off with it, till\r\nat last I quite laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked out for a\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\nThat evil influence which carried me first away from my father’s\r\nhouse, that hurried me into the wild and indigested notion of raising\r\nmy fortune, and that impressed those conceits so forcibly upon me as\r\nto make me deaf to all good advice, and to the entreaties and even\r\ncommand of my father--I say, the same influence, whatever it was,\r\npresented the most unfortunate of all enterprises to my view; and I\r\nwent on board a vessel bound to the coast of Africa, or, as our sailors\r\nvulgarly call it, a voyage to Guinea.\r\n\r\nIt was my great misfortune that in all these adventures I did not ship\r\nmyself as a sailor, whereby, though I might indeed have worked a little\r\nharder than ordinary, yet at the same time I had learned the duty and\r\noffice of a foremast man, and in time might have qualified myself for a\r\nmate or lieutenant, if not for a master. But as it was always my fate\r\nto choose for the worse, so I did here; for having money in my pocket,\r\nand good clothes upon my back, I would always go on board in the habit\r\nof a gentleman; and so I neither had any business in the ship, or\r\nlearned to do any.\r\n\r\nIt was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company in London,\r\nwhich does not always happen to such loose and misguided young fellows\r\nas I then was; the devil generally not omitting to lay some snare for\r\nthem very early; but it was not so with me. I first fell acquainted\r\nwith the master of a ship who had been on the coast of Guinea, and who,\r\nhaving had very good success there, was resolved to go again; and who,\r\ntaking a fancy to my conversation, which was not at all disagreeable\r\nat that time, hearing me say I had a mind to see the world, told me if\r\nI would go the voyage with him I should be at no expense; I should be\r\nhis messmate and his companion; and if I could carry anything with me,\r\nI should have all the advantage of it that the trade would permit, and\r\nperhaps I might meet with some encouragement.\r\n\r\nI embraced the offer, and, entering into a strict friendship with\r\nthis captain, who was an honest and plain-dealing man, I went the\r\nvoyage with him, and carried a small adventure with me, which, by\r\nthe disinterested honesty of my friend the captain, I increased very\r\nconsiderably, for I carried about £40 in such toys and trifles as the\r\ncaptain directed me to buy. This £40 I had mustered together by the\r\nassistance of some of my relations whom I corresponded with, and who, I\r\nbelieve, got my father, or at least my mother, to contribute so much as\r\nthat to my first adventure.\r\n\r\nThis was the only voyage which I may say was successful in all my\r\nadventures, and which I owe to the integrity and honesty of my friend\r\nthe captain; under whom also I got a competent knowledge of the\r\nmathematics and the rules of navigation, learned how to keep an account\r\nof the ship’s course, take an observation, and, in short, to understand\r\nsome things that were needful to be understood by a sailor. For, as he\r\ntook delight to introduce me, I took delight to learn; and, in a word,\r\nthis voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant; for I brought home\r\nfive pounds nine ounces of gold dust for my adventure, which yielded\r\nme in London at my return almost £300, and this filled me with those\r\naspiring thoughts which have since so completed my ruin.\r\n\r\nYet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too; particularly, that\r\nI was continually sick, being thrown into a violent fever by the\r\nexcessive heat of the climate; our principal trading being upon the\r\ncoast, from the latitude of 15 degrees north even to the line itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n_Robinson’s Captivity at Sallee--Escape with Xury--Arrival at the\r\nBrazils_\r\n\r\n\r\nI was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my friend, to my great\r\nmisfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go the same\r\nvoyage again, and I embarked in the same vessel with one who was his\r\nmate in the former voyage, and had now got the command of the ship.\r\nThis was the unhappiest voyage, that ever man made; for though I did\r\nnot carry quite £100 of my new-gained wealth, so that I had £200 left,\r\nand which I lodged with my friend’s widow, who was very just to me,\r\nyet I fell into terrible misfortunes in this voyage; and the first was\r\nthis, viz., our ship making her course toward the Canary Islands, or\r\nrather between those islands and the African shore, was surprised in\r\nthe gray of the morning by a Turkish rover of Sallee, who gave chase\r\nto us with all the sail she could make. We crowded also as much canvas\r\nas our yards would spread, or our masts carry, to have got clear; but\r\nfinding the pirate gained upon us, and would certainly come up with\r\nus in a few hours, we prepared to fight, our ship having twelve guns,\r\nand the rogue eighteen. About three in the afternoon he came up with\r\nus, and bringing to, by mistake, just athwart our quarter, instead of\r\nathwart our stern, as he intended, we brought eight of our guns to bear\r\non that side, and poured in a broadside upon him, which made him sheer\r\noff again, after returning our fire and pouring in also his small-shot\r\nfrom near 200 men which he had on board. However, we had not a man\r\ntouched, all our men keeping close. He prepared to attack us again, and\r\nwe to defend ourselves; but laying us on board the next time upon our\r\nother quarter, he entered sixty men upon our decks, who immediately\r\nfell to cutting and hacking the decks and rigging. We plied them with\r\nsmall-shot, half-pikes, powder-chests, and such like, and cleared our\r\ndeck of them twice. However, to cut short this melancholy part of our\r\nstory, our ship being disabled, and three of our men killed and eight\r\nwounded, we were obliged to yield, and were carried all prisoners into\r\nSallee, a port belonging to the Moors.\r\n\r\nThe usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I apprehended,\r\nnor was I carried up the country to the emperor’s court, as the rest\r\nof our men were, but was kept by the captain of the rover as his\r\nproper prize, and made his slave, being young and nimble, and fit for\r\nhis business. At this surprising change of my circumstances from a\r\nmerchant to a miserable slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed; and now I\r\nlooked back upon my father’s prophetic discourse to me, that I should\r\nbe miserable, and have none to relieve me, which I thought was now so\r\neffectually brought to pass, that it could not be worse; that now the\r\nhand of Heaven had overtaken me, and I was undone without redemption.\r\nBut alas; this was but a taste of the misery I was to go through, as\r\nwill appear in the sequel of this story.\r\n\r\nAs my new patron, or master, had taken me home to his house, so I was\r\nin hopes that he would take me with him when he went to sea again,\r\nbelieving that it would some time or other be his fate to be taken by\r\na Spanish or Portuguese man-o-war; and that then I should be set at\r\nliberty. But this hope of mine was soon taken away; for when he went to\r\nsea, he left me on shore to look after his little garden, and do the\r\ncommon drudgery of slaves about his house; and when he came home again\r\nfrom his cruise, he ordered me to lie in the cabin to look after the\r\nship.\r\n\r\nHere I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method I might take\r\nto effect it, but found no way that had the least probability in it.\r\nNothing presented to make the supposition of it rational; for I had\r\nnobody to communicate it to that would embark with me, no fellow-slave,\r\nno Englishman, Irishman, or Scotsman there but myself; so that for two\r\nyears, though I often pleased myself with the imagination, yet I never\r\nhad the least encouraging prospect of putting it in practice.\r\n\r\nAfter about two years an odd circumstance presented itself, which put\r\nthe old thought of making some attempt for my liberty again in my head.\r\nMy patron lying at home longer than usual without fitting out his ship,\r\nwhich, as I heard, was for want of money, he used constantly, once or\r\ntwice a week, sometimes oftener, if the weather was fair, to take the\r\nship’s pinnace, and go out into the road a-fishing; and as he always\r\ntook me and a young Maresco with him to row the boat, we made him very\r\nmerry, and I proved very dexterous in catching fish; insomuch, that\r\nsometimes he would send me with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the\r\nyouth the Maresco, as they called him, to catch a dish of fish for him.\r\n\r\nIt happened one time that, going a-fishing in a stark calm morning, a\r\nfog rose so thick, that though we were not half a league from the shore\r\nwe lost sight of it; and rowing we knew not whither or which way, we\r\nlabored all day, and all the next night, and when the morning came we\r\nfound we had pulled off to sea instead of pulling in for the shore; and\r\nthat we were at least two leagues from the shore. However, we got well\r\nin again, though with a great deal of labor, and some danger, for the\r\nwind began to blow pretty fresh in the morning; but particularly we\r\nwere all very hungry.\r\n\r\nBut our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take more care of\r\nhimself for the future; and having lying by him the long-boat of our\r\nEnglish ship which he had taken, he resolved he would not go a-fishing\r\nany more without a compass and some provisions; so he ordered the\r\ncarpenter of his ship, who also was an English slave, to build a little\r\nstate-room, or cabin, in the middle of the long-boat, like that of\r\na barge, with a place to stand behind it to steer and haul home the\r\nmain-sheet, and room before for a hand or two to stand and work the\r\nsails. She sailed with what we call a shoulder-of-mutton sail; and the\r\nboom jibed over the top of the cabin, which lay very snug and low, and\r\nhad in it room for him to lie, with a slave or two, and a table to eat\r\non, with some small lockers to put in some bottles of such liquor as he\r\nthought fit to drink; particularly his bread, rice, and coffee.\r\n\r\nWe went frequently out with this boat a-fishing, and as I was most\r\ndexterous to catch fish for him, he never went without me. It happened\r\nthat he had appointed to go out in this boat, either for pleasure or\r\nfor fish, with two or three Moors of some distinction in that place,\r\nand for whom he had provided extraordinarily; and had therefore sent on\r\nboard the boat overnight a larger store of provisions than ordinary;\r\nand had ordered me to get ready three fusees with powder and shot,\r\nwhich were on board his ship, for that they designed some sport of\r\nfowling as well as fishing.\r\n\r\nI got all things ready as he had directed, and waited the next morning\r\nwith the boat, washed clean, her ancient and pendants out, and\r\neverything to accommodate his guests; when by and by my patron came\r\non board alone, and told me his guests had put off going, upon some\r\nbusiness that fell out, and ordered me with the man and boy, as usual,\r\nto go out with the boat and catch them some fish, for that his friends\r\nwere to sup at his house; and commanded that as soon as I had got some\r\nfish I should bring it home to his house; all which I prepared to do.\r\n\r\nThis moment my former notions of deliverance darted into my thoughts,\r\nfor now I found I was like to have a little ship at my command; and\r\nmy master being gone I prepared to furnish myself, not for a fishing\r\nbusiness, but for a voyage; though I knew not, neither did I so much\r\nas consider, whither I should steer; for anywhere, to get out of that\r\nplace, was my way.\r\n\r\nMy first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this Moor,\r\nto get something for our subsistence on board; for I told him we must\r\nnot presume to eat of our patron’s bread. He said that was true; so\r\nhe brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit of their kind, and three\r\njars with fresh water, into the boat. I knew where my patron’s case of\r\nbottles stood, which it was evident by the make were taken out of some\r\nEnglish prize; and I conveyed them into the boat while the Moor was on\r\nshore, as if they had been there before for our master.\r\n\r\nI conveyed also a great lump of beeswax into the boat, which weighed\r\nabove half a hundredweight, with a parcel of twine or thread, a\r\nhatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all which were of great use to us\r\nafterwards, especially the wax to make candles. Another trick I tried\r\nupon him, which he innocently came into also. His name was Ismael, who\r\nthey call Muly, or Moely; so I called to him, “Moely,” said I, “our\r\npatron’s guns are on board the boat; can you not get a little powder\r\nand shot? It may be we may kill some alcamies (a fowl like our curlews)\r\nfor ourselves for I know he keeps the gunner’s stores in the ship.”\r\n“Yes,” said he, “I’ll bring some”; and accordingly he brought a great\r\nleather pouch which held about a pound and a half of powder, or rather\r\nmore; and another with shot, that had five or six pounds with some\r\nbullets, and put all into the boat. At the same time I had found some\r\npowder of my master’s in the great cabin, with which I filled one of\r\nthe large bottles in the case, which was almost empty, pouring what\r\nwas in it into another; and thus furnished with everything needful, we\r\nsailed out of the port to fish. The castle, which is at the entrance\r\nof the port, knew who we were, and took no notice of us; and we were\r\nnot above a mile out of the port before we hauled in our sail, and set\r\nus down to fish. The wind blew from the N.N.E., which was contrary to\r\nmy desire; for had it blown southerly I had been sure to have made\r\nthe coast of Spain, and at least reached to the bay of Cadiz; but my\r\nresolutions were, blow which way it would, I would be gone from the\r\nhorrid place where I was, and leave the rest to Fate.\r\n\r\nAfter we had fished some time and caught nothing, for when I had fish\r\non my hook I would not pull them up, that he might not see them, I said\r\nto the Moor, “This will not do; our master will not be thus served; we\r\nmust stand farther off.” He, thinking no harm, agreed, and being in the\r\nhead of the boat set the sails; and as I had the helm I run the boat\r\nout near a league farther, and then brought her to as if I would fish;\r\nwhen giving the boy the helm, I stepped forward to where the Moor was,\r\nand making as if I stooped for something behind him, I took him by\r\nsurprise with my arm under his twist, and tossed him clear overboard\r\ninto the sea. He rose immediately, for he swam like a cork, and called\r\nto me, begged to be taken in, told me he would go all the world over\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\nHe swam so strong after the boat, that he would have reached me very\r\nquickly, there being but little wind; upon which I stepped into the\r\ncabin, and fetching one of the fowling-pieces, I presented it at him,\r\nand told him I had done him no hurt, and if he would be quiet I would\r\ndo him none. “But,” said I, “you swim well enough to reach to the\r\nshore, and the sea is calm; make the best of your way to shore, and\r\nI will do you no harm; but if you come near the boat I’ll shoot you\r\nthrough the head, for I am resolved to have my liberty.” So he turned\r\nhimself about, and swam for the shore, and I make no doubt but he\r\nreached it with ease, for he was an excellent swimmer.\r\n\r\nI could have been content to have taken this Moor with me, and have\r\ndrowned the boy, but there was no venturing to trust him. When he was\r\ngone I turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, and said to him,\r\n“Xury, if you will be faithful to me I’ll make you a great man; but\r\nif you will not stroke your face to be true to me,” that is, swear by\r\nMahomet and his father’s beard, “I must throw you into the sea too.”\r\nThe boy smiled in my face, and spoke so innocently, that I could not\r\nmistrust him, and swore to be faithful to me, and go all over the world\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\nWhile I was in view of the Moor who was swimming, I stood out directly\r\nto sea with the boat, rather stretching to windward, that they might\r\nthink me gone toward the straits’ mouth (as indeed any one that had\r\nbeen in their wits must have been supposed to be); for who would have\r\nsupposed we would sail on to the southward to the truly barbarian\r\ncoast, where whole nations of negroes were sure to surround us with\r\ntheir canoes, and destroy us; where we could ne’er once go on shore but\r\nwe should be devoured by savage beasts, or more merciless savages of\r\nhuman kind?\r\n\r\nBut as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my course, and\r\nsteered directly south and by east, bending my course a little toward\r\nthe east, that I might keep in with the shore; and having a fair, fresh\r\ngale of wind, and a smooth, quiet sea, I made such sail that I believed\r\nby the next day at three o’clock in the afternoon, when I first made\r\nthe land, I could not be less than 150 miles south of Sallee; quite\r\nbeyond the Emperor of Morocco’s dominions, or indeed of any other king\r\nthereabouts, for we saw no people.\r\n\r\nYet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors, and the dreadful\r\napprehensions I had of falling into their hands, that I would not stop,\r\nor go on shore, or come to anchor, the wind continuing fair, till I\r\nhad sailed in that manner five days; and then the wind shifting to the\r\nsouthward, I concluded also that if any of their vessels were in chase\r\nof me, they also would now give over; so I ventured to make to the\r\ncoast, and came to an anchor in the mouth of a little river, I knew not\r\nwhat, or where; neither what latitude, what country, what nation, or\r\nwhat river. I neither saw, or desired to see, any people; the principal\r\nthing I wanted was fresh water. We came into this creek in the evening,\r\nresolving to swim to shore as soon as it was dark, and discover the\r\ncountry; but as soon as it was quite dark we heard such dreadful\r\nnoises of the barking, roaring, and howling of wild creatures, of we\r\nknew not what kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with fear,\r\nand begged of me not to go on shore till day. “Well, Xury,” said I,\r\n“then I won’t; but it may be we may see men by day, who will be as bad\r\nto us as those lions.” “Then we give them the shoot gun,” said Xury,\r\nlaughing; “make them run away.” Such English Xury spoke by conversing\r\namong us slaves. However, I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and\r\nI gave him a dram (out of our patron’s case of bottles) to cheer him\r\nup. After all, Xury’s advice was good, and I took it; we dropped our\r\nlittle anchor and lay still all night. I say still, for we slept none;\r\nfor in two or three hours we saw vast great creatures (we knew not what\r\nto call them) of many sorts come down to the sea-shore and run into the\r\nwater, wallowing and washing themselves for the pleasure of cooling\r\nthemselves; and they made such hideous howlings and yellings, that I\r\nnever indeed heard the like.\r\n\r\nXury was dreadfully frightened, and indeed so was I too; but we were\r\nboth more frightened when we heard one of these mighty creatures come\r\nswimming towards our boat; we could not see him, but we might hear him\r\nby his blowing to be a monstrous huge and furious beast. Xury said it\r\nwas a lion, and it might be so for aught I know; but poor Xury cried to\r\nme to weigh the anchor and row away. “No,” says I, “Xury; we can slip\r\nour cable with the buoy to it, and go off to sea; they cannot follow us\r\nfar.” I had no sooner said so, but I perceived the creature (whatever\r\nit was) within two oars’ length, which something surprised me; however,\r\nI immediately stepped to the cabin door, and taking up my gun, fired at\r\nhim, upon which he immediately turned about and swam towards the shore\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nBut it is impossible to describe the horrible noises, and hideous cries\r\nand howlings, that were raised, as well upon the edge of the shore as\r\nhigher within the country, upon the noise or report of the gun, a thing\r\nI have some reason to believe those creatures had never heard before.\r\nThis convinced me that there was no going on shore for us in the night\r\nupon that coast; and how to venture on shore in the day was another\r\nquestion too; for to have fallen into the hands of any of the savages,\r\nhad been as bad as to have fallen into the hands of lions and tigers;\r\nat least we were equally apprehensive of the danger of it.\r\n\r\nBe that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore somewhere or other\r\nfor water, for we had not a pint left in the boat; when or where to get\r\nto it, was the point. Xury said if I would let him go on shore with one\r\nof the jars, he would find if there was any water and bring some to\r\nme. I asked him why he should go? why I should not go and he stay in\r\nthe boat? The boy answered with so much affection, that made me love\r\nhim ever after. Said he, “If wild mans come, they eat me, you go way.”\r\n“Well, Xury,” said I, “we will both go; and if the wild mans come, we\r\nwill kill them, they shall eat neither of us.” So I gave Xury a piece\r\nof rusk bread to eat, and a dram out of our patron’s case of bottles\r\nwhich I mentioned before; and we hauled in the boat as near the shore\r\nas we thought was proper, and so waded to shore, carrying nothing but\r\nour arms and two jars for water.\r\n\r\nI did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the coming of\r\ncanoes with savages down the river; but the boy seeing a low place\r\nabout a mile up the country, rambled to it; and by and by I saw him\r\ncome running towards me. I thought he was pursued by some savage, or\r\nfrightened with some wild beast, and I ran towards him to help him; but\r\nwhen I came nearer to him, I saw something hanging over his shoulders,\r\nwhich was a creature that he had shot, like a hare, but different in\r\ncolor, and longer legs. However, we were very glad of it, and it was\r\nvery good meat; but the great joy that poor Xury came with was to tell\r\nme he had found good water, and had seen no wild mans.\r\n\r\nBut we found afterwards that we need not take such pains for water, for\r\na little higher up the creek where we were we found the water fresh\r\nwhen the tide was out, which flowed but a little way up; so we filled\r\nour jars, and feasted on the hare we had killed, and prepared to go on\r\nour way, having seen no footsteps of any human creature in that part of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nAs I had been one voyage to this coast before, I knew very well that\r\nthe islands of the Canaries, and the Cape de Verde Islands also, lay\r\nnot far off from the coast. But as I had no instruments to take an\r\nobservation to know what latitude we were in, and did not exactly know,\r\nor at least remember, what latitude they were in, I knew not where to\r\nlook for them, or when to stand off to sea towards them; otherwise I\r\nmight now easily have found some of these islands. But my hope was,\r\nthat if I stood along this coast till I came to that part where the\r\nEnglish traded, I should find some of their vessels upon their usual\r\ndesign of trade, that would relieve and take us in.\r\n\r\nBy the best of my calculation, that place where I now was must be that\r\ncountry which, lying between the Emperor of Morocco’s dominions and\r\nthe negroes, lies waste and uninhabited, except by wild beasts; the\r\nnegroes having abandoned it and gone farther south for fear of the\r\nMoors, and the Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting, by reason of\r\nits barrenness; and indeed both forsaking it because of the prodigious\r\nnumbers of tigers, lions, leopards, and other furious creatures which\r\nharbor there; so that the Moors use it for their hunting only, where\r\nthey go like an army, two or three thousand men at a time; and indeed\r\nfor near an hundred miles together upon this coast we saw nothing but\r\na waste uninhabited country by day, and heard nothing but howlings and\r\nroarings of wild beasts by night.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice in the daytime I thought I saw the Pico of Teneriffe,\r\nbeing the high top of the Mountain Teneriffe in the Canaries, and had\r\na great mind to venture out, in hopes of reaching thither; but having\r\ntried twice, I was forced in again by contrary winds, the sea also\r\ngoing too high for my little vessel; so I resolved to pursue my first\r\ndesign, and keep along the shore.\r\n\r\nSeveral times I was obliged to land for fresh water after we had left\r\nthis place; and once in particular, being early in the morning, we came\r\nto an anchor under a little point of land which was pretty high; and\r\nthe tide beginning to flow, we lay still to go farther in. Xury, whose\r\neyes were more about him than it seems mine were, called softly to me,\r\nand told me that we had best go farther off the shore; “For,” said he,\r\n“look, yonder lies a dreadful monster on the side of that hillock fast\r\nasleep.” I looked where he pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed,\r\nfor it was a terrible great lion that lay on the side of the shore,\r\nunder the shade of a piece of the hill that hung as it were a little\r\nover him. “Xury,” said I, “you shall go on shore and kill him.” Xury\r\nlooked frightened, and said, “Me kill! he eat me at one mouth”; one\r\nmouthful he meant. However, I said no more to the boy, but bade him lie\r\nstill, and I took our biggest gun, which was almost musket-bore, and\r\nloaded it with a good charge of powder, and with two slugs, and laid it\r\ndown; then I loaded another gun with two bullets; and the third (for we\r\nhad three pieces) I loaded with five smaller bullets. I took the best\r\naim I could with the first piece to have shot him into the head, but he\r\nlay so with his leg raised a little above his nose, that the slugs hit\r\nhis leg about the knee, and broke the bone. He started up growling at\r\nfirst, but finding his leg broke, fell down again, and then got up upon\r\nthree legs and gave the most hideous roar that ever I heard. I was a\r\nlittle surprised that I had not hit him on the head. However, I took up\r\nthe second piece immediately, and, though he began to move off, fired\r\nagain, and shot him into the head, and had the pleasure to see him\r\ndrop, and make but little noise, but lay struggling for life. Then Xury\r\ntook heart, and would have me let him go on shore. “Well, go,” said I;\r\nso the boy jumped into the water, and taking a little gun in one hand,\r\nswam to shore with the other hand, and coming close to the creature,\r\nput the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him into the head\r\nagain, which despatched him quite.\r\n\r\nThis was game indeed to us, but this was no food; and I was very sorry\r\nto lose three charges of powder and shot upon a creature that was good\r\nfor nothing to us. However, Xury said he would have some of him; so he\r\ncomes on board, and asked me to give him the hatchet. “For what, Xury?”\r\nsaid I. “Me cut off his head,” said he. However, Xury could not cut off\r\nhis head, but he cut off a foot, and brought it with him, and it was a\r\nmonstrous great one.\r\n\r\nI bethought myself, however, that perhaps the skin of him might one way\r\nor other be of some value to us; and I resolved to take off his skin\r\nif I could. So Xury and I went to work with him; but Xury was much the\r\nbetter workman at it, for I knew very ill how to do it. Indeed, it took\r\nus up both the whole day, but at last we got off the hide of him, and\r\nspreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun effectually dried it in\r\ntwo days’ time, and it afterwards served me to lie upon.\r\n\r\nAfter this stop we made on to the southward continually for ten or\r\ntwelve days, living very sparing on our provisions, which began\r\nto abate very much, and going no oftener into the shore than we\r\nwere obliged to for fresh water. My design in this was to make the\r\nriver Gambia or Senegal--that is to say, anywhere about the Cape de\r\nVerde--where I was in hopes to meet with some European ship; and if I\r\ndid not, I knew not what course I had to take, but to seek out for the\r\nislands or perish there among the negroes. I knew that all the ships\r\nfrom Europe, which sailed either to the coast of Guinea or to Brazil,\r\nor to the East Indies, made this cape, or those islands; and in a word,\r\nI put the whole of my fortune upon this single point, either that I\r\nmust meet with some ship, or must perish.\r\n\r\nWhen I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer, as I have\r\nsaid, I began to see that the land was inhabited; and in two or three\r\nplaces, as we sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore to look\r\nat us; we could also perceive they were quite black, and stark naked.\r\nI was once inclined to have gone on shore to them; but Xury was my\r\nbetter councilor, and said to me, “No go, no go.” However, I hauled in\r\nnearer the shore that I might talk to them, and I found they ran along\r\nthe shore by me a good way. I observed they had no weapons in their\r\nhands, except one, who had a long slender stick, which Xury said was a\r\nlance, and that they would throw them a great way with good aim. So I\r\nkept at a distance, but talked with them by signs as well as I could,\r\nand particularly made signs for something to eat; they beckoned to me\r\nto stop my boat, and that they would fetch me some meat. Upon this I\r\nlowered the top of my sail, and lay by, and two of them ran up into\r\nthe country, and in less than half-an-hour came back, and brought with\r\nthem two pieces of dried flesh and some corn, such as is the produce\r\nof their country; but we neither knew what the one or the other was.\r\nHowever, we were willing to accept it, but how to come at it was our\r\nnext dispute, for I was not for venturing on shore to them, and they\r\nwere as much afraid of us; but they took a safe way for us all, for\r\nthey brought it to the shore and laid it down, and went and stood a\r\ngreat way off till we fetched it on board, and then came close to us\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nWe made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to make them\r\namends. But an opportunity offered that very instant to oblige them\r\nwonderfully; for while we were lying by the shore came two mighty\r\ncreatures, one pursuing the other (as we took it) with great fury from\r\nthe mountains towards the sea; whether it was the male pursuing the\r\nfemale, or whether they were in sport or in rage, we could not tell,\r\nany more than we could tell whether it was usual or strange, but I\r\nbelieve it was the latter: because, in the first place, those ravenous\r\ncreatures seldom appear but in the night; and in the second place, we\r\nfound the people terribly frightened, especially the women.\r\n\r\nThe man that had the lance or dart did not fly from them but the rest\r\ndid; however, as the two creatures ran directly into the water, they\r\ndid not seem to offer to fall upon any of the negroes, but plunged\r\nthemselves into the sea, and swam about, as if they had come for their\r\ndiversion. At last, one of them began to come nearer our boat than at\r\nfirst I expected; but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded my gun with\r\nall possible expedition, and bade Xury load both the others. As soon as\r\nhe came fairly within my reach, I fired, and shot him directly into the\r\nhead; immediately he sunk down into the water, but rose instantly, and\r\nplunged up and down, as if he was struggling for life, and so indeed he\r\nwas. He immediately made to the shore; but between the wound, which was\r\nhis mortal hurt, and the strangling of the water, he died just before\r\nhe reached the shore.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor creatures,\r\nat the noise and the fire of my gun; some of them were even ready to\r\ndie for fear, and fell down as dead with the very terror. But when they\r\nsaw the creature dead, and sunk in the water, and that I made signs to\r\nthem to come to the shore, they took heart and came to the shore, and\r\nbegan to search for the creature. I found him by his blood staining the\r\nwater: and by the help of a rope, which I slung round him, and gave the\r\nnegroes to haul, they dragged him on the shore, and found that it was a\r\nmost curious leopard, spotted, and fine to an admirable degree; and the\r\nnegroes held up their hands with admiration, to think what I had killed\r\nhim with.\r\n\r\nThe other creature, frightened with the flash of fire and the noise\r\nof the gun, swam on shore, and ran up directly to the mountains from\r\nwhence they came; nor could I, at that distance, know what it was. I\r\nfound quickly the negroes were for eating the flesh of this creature,\r\nso I was willing to have them take it as a favor from me; which when I\r\nmade signs to them that they might take him, they were very thankful\r\nfor. Immediately they fell to work with him; and though they had no\r\nknife, yet, with a sharpened piece of wood, they took off his skin as\r\nreadily, and much more readily than we could have done with a knife.\r\nThey offered me some of the flesh, which I declined, making as if I\r\nwould give it them, but made signs for the skin, which they gave me\r\nvery freely, and brought me a great deal more of their provision,\r\nwhich though I did not understand, yet I accepted. Then I made signs\r\nto them for some water, and held out one of my jars to them, turning\r\nit bottom upward, to show that it was empty, and that I wanted to have\r\nit filled. They called immediately to some of their friends, and there\r\ncame two women, and brought a great vessel made of earth, and burnt, as\r\nI suppose, in the sun; this they set down for me, as before, and I sent\r\nXury on shore with my jars, and filled them all three. The women were\r\nas stark naked as the men.\r\n\r\nI was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was, and water;\r\nand leaving my friendly negroes, I made forward for about eleven days\r\nmore, without offering to go near the shore, till I saw the land rim\r\nout a great length into the sea, at about the distance of four or five\r\nleagues before me; and the sea being very calm. I kept a large offing,\r\nto make this point. At length doubling the point, at about two leagues\r\nfrom the land, I saw plainly land on the other side, to seaward; then\r\nI concluded, as it was most certain indeed, that this was the Cape de\r\nVerde, and those the islands, called from thence Cape de Verde Islands.\r\nHowever, they were at a great distance, and I could not well tell what\r\nI had best to do; for if I should be taken with a fresh wind, I might\r\nneither reach one nor other.\r\n\r\nIn this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the cabin, and\r\nsat me down, Xury having the helm; when, on a sudden, the boy cried\r\nout, “Master, master, a ship with a sail!” and the foolish boy was\r\nfrightened out of his wits, thinking it must needs be some of his\r\nmaster’s ships sent to pursue us, when I knew we were gotten far enough\r\nout of their reach. I jumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw not\r\nonly the ship, but what she was, viz., that it was a Portuguese ship,\r\nand, as I thought, was bound to the coast of Guinea, for negroes. But\r\nwhen I observed the course she steered, I was soon convinced they were\r\nbound some other way, and did not design to come any nearer to the\r\nshore; upon which I stretched out to sea as much as I could, resolving\r\nto speak with them, if possible.\r\n\r\nWith all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able to come\r\nin their way, but that they would be gone by before I could make any\r\nsignal to them; but after I had crowded to the utmost, and began to\r\ndespair, they, it seems, saw me by the help of their perspective\r\nglasses, and that it was some European boat, which, as they supposed,\r\nmust belong to some ship that was lost, so they shortened sail to let\r\nme come up.\r\n\r\nI was encouraged with this; and as I had my patron’s flag on board, I\r\nmade a waft of it to them for a signal of distress, and fired a gun,\r\nboth of which they saw; for they told me they saw the smoke, though\r\nthey did not hear the gun. Upon these signals they very kindly brought\r\nto, and lay by for me; and in about three hours’ time I came up with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThey asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish, and in French,\r\nbut I understood none of them; but at last a Scots sailor, who was\r\non board, called to me, and I answered him, and told him I was an\r\nEnglishman, that I had made my escape out of slavery from the Moors, at\r\nSallee. Then they bade me come on board, and very kindly took me in,\r\nand all my goods.\r\n\r\nIt was an inexpressible joy to me, that any one will believe, that I\r\nwas thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a miserable, and almost\r\nhopeless, condition as I was in; and I immediately offered all I had\r\nto the captain of the ship, as a return for my deliverance. But he\r\ngenerously told me he would take nothing from me, but that all I had\r\nshould be delivered safe to me when I came to the Brazils. “For,” says\r\nhe, “I have saved your life on no other terms than I would be glad to\r\nbe saved myself; and it may, one time or other, be my lot to be taken\r\nup in the same condition. Besides,” says he, “when I carry you to the\r\nBrazils, so great a way from your own country, if I should take from\r\nyou what you have, you will be starved there, and then I only take\r\naway that life I have given. No, no, Seignior Inglese,” says he, “Mr.\r\nEnglishman, I will carry you thither in charity, and those things will\r\nhelp you to buy your subsistence there, and your passage home again.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n_He Settles in the Brazils as a Planter--Makes another Voyage and is\r\nShipwrecked_\r\n\r\n\r\nAs he was charitable in his proposal, so he was just in the performance\r\nto a tittle; for he ordered the seamen that none should offer to touch\r\nanything I had; then he took everything into his own possession, and\r\ngave me back an exact inventory of them, that I might have them, even\r\nso much as my three earthen jars.\r\n\r\nAs to my boat, it was a very good one, and that he saw, and told me he\r\nwould buy it of me for the ship’s use, and asked me what I would have\r\nfor it? I told him he had been so generous to me in everything, that I\r\ncould not offer to make any price for the boat, but left it entirely to\r\nhim; upon which he told me he would give me a note of his hand to pay\r\nme eighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil, and when it came there, if\r\nany one offered to give more, he would make it up. He offered me also\r\nsixty pieces of eight more for my boy, Xury, which I was loth to take;\r\nnot that I was not willing to let the captain have him, but I was very\r\nloth to sell the poor boy’s liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully\r\nin procuring my own. However, when I let him know my reason, he owned\r\nit to be just, and offered me this medium, that he would give the boy\r\nan obligation to set him free in ten years if he turned Christian.\r\nUpon this, and Xury saying he was willing to go to him, I let the\r\ncaptain have him.\r\n\r\nWe had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and arrived in the Bay\r\nde Todos los Santos, or All Saints’ Bay, in about twenty-two days\r\nafter. And now I was once more delivered from the most miserable of\r\nall conditions of life; and what to do next with myself I was now to\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\nThe generous treatment the captain gave me, I can never enough\r\nremember. He would take nothing of me for my passage, gave me twenty\r\nducats for the leopard’s skin, and forty for the lion’s skin, which\r\nI had in my boat, and caused everything I had in the ship to be\r\npunctually delivered me; and what I was willing to sell he bought, such\r\nas the case of bottles, two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of\r\nbeeswax--for I had made candles of the rest; in a word, I made about\r\n220 pieces of eight of all my cargo, and with this stock I went on\r\nshore in the Brazils.\r\n\r\nI had not been long here, but being recommended to the house of a good\r\nhonest man like himself, who had an _ingeino_ as they call it, that\r\nis, a plantation and a sugar-house, I lived with him some time, and\r\nacquainted myself by that means with the manner of their planting and\r\nmaking of sugar; and seeing how well the planters lived, and how they\r\ngrew rich suddenly, I resolved, if I could get a license to settle\r\nthere, I would turn planter among them, resolving in the meantime to\r\nfind out some way to get my money which I left in London remitted to\r\nme. To this purpose, getting a kind of a letter of naturalization, I\r\npurchased as much land that was uncured as my money would reach, and\r\nformed a plan for my plantation and settlement, and such a one as might\r\nbe suitable to the stock which I proposed to myself to receive from\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nI had a neighbor, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but born of English parents,\r\nwhose name was Wells, and in much such circumstances as I was. I call\r\nhim my neighbor, because his plantation lay next to mine, and we went\r\non very sociably together. My stock was but low, as well as his; and\r\nwe rather planted for food than anything else, for about two years.\r\nHowever, we began to increase, and our land began to come into order;\r\nso that the third year we planted some tobacco, and made each of us a\r\nlarge piece of ground ready for planting canes in the year to come. But\r\nwe both wanted help; and now I found more than before, I had done wrong\r\nin parting with my boy Xury.\r\n\r\nBut alas! for me to do wrong that never did right was no great wonder.\r\nI had no remedy but to go on. I was gotten into an employment quite\r\nremote to my genius, and directly contrary to the life I delighted in,\r\nand for which I forsook my father’s house, and broke through all his\r\ngood advice; nay, I was coming into the very middle station, or upper\r\ndegree of low life, which my father advised me to before; and which,\r\nif I resolved to go on with, I might as well have stayed at home, and\r\nnever have fatigued myself in the world as I had done. And I used often\r\nto say to myself, I could have done this as well in England among my\r\nfriends, as have gone 5,000 miles off to do it among strangers and\r\nsavages, in a wilderness, and at such a distance as never to hear from\r\nany part of the world that had the least knowledge of me.\r\n\r\nIn this manner I used to look upon my condition with the utmost regret.\r\nI had nobody to converse with, but now and then this neighbor; no work\r\nto be done, but by the labor of my hands; and I used to say, I lived\r\njust like a man cast away upon some desolate island, that had nobody\r\nthere but himself. But how just has it been! and how should all men\r\nreflect, that when they compare their present conditions with others\r\nthat are worse, Heaven may oblige them to make the exchange, and be\r\nconvinced of their former felicity by their experience;--I say, how\r\njust has it been, that the truly solitary life I reflected on in an\r\nisland of mere desolation should be my lot, who had so often unjustly\r\ncompared it with the life which I then led, in which, had I continued,\r\nI had in all probability been exceeding prosperous and rich.\r\n\r\nI was in some degree settled in my measures for carrying on the\r\nplantation before my kind friend, the captain of the ship that took\r\nme up at sea, went back; for the ship remained there in providing his\r\nloading, and preparing for his voyage, near three months; when, telling\r\nhim what little stock I had left behind me in London, he gave me this\r\nfriendly and sincere advice: “Seignior Inglese,” says he, for so he\r\nalways called me, “if you will give me letters, and a procuration here\r\nin form to me, with orders to the person who has your money in London\r\nto send your effects to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, and\r\nin such goods as are proper for this country, I will bring you the\r\nproduce of them, God willing, at my return. But since human affairs\r\nare all subject to changes and disaster, I would have you give orders\r\nbut for one hundred pounds sterling, which, you say, is half your\r\nstock, and let the hazard be run for the first; so that if it come\r\nsafe, you may order the rest the same way; and if it miscarry, you may\r\nhave the other half to have recourse to for your supply.”\r\n\r\nThis was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that I could not\r\nbut be convinced it was the best course I could take; so I accordingly\r\nprepared letters to the gentlewoman with whom I had left my money, and\r\na procuration to the Portuguese captain, as he desired.\r\n\r\nI wrote the English captain’s widow a full account of all my\r\nadventures; my slavery, escape, and how I had met with the Portuguese\r\ncaptain at sea, the humanity of his behavior, and in what condition\r\nI was now in, with all other necessary directions for my supply. And\r\nwhen this honest captain came to Lisbon, he found means, by some of\r\nthe English merchants there, to send over not the order only, but a\r\nfull account of my story to a merchant at London, who represented it\r\neffectually to her; whereupon, she not only delivered the money, but\r\nout of her own pocket sent the Portuguese captain a very handsome\r\npresent for his humanity and charity to me.\r\n\r\nThe merchant in London vesting this hundred pounds in English goods,\r\nsuch as the captain had written for, sent them directly to him at\r\nLisbon, and he brought them all safe to me to the Brazils; among which,\r\nwithout my direction (for I was too young in my business to think of\r\nthem), he had taken care to have all sorts of tools, iron-work, and\r\nutensils necessary for my plantation, and which were of great use to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nWhen this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune made, for I was surprised\r\nwith joy of it; and my good steward, the captain, had laid out the five\r\npounds, which my friend had sent him for a present for himself, to\r\npurchase and bring me over a servant under bond for six years’ service,\r\nand would not accept of any consideration, except a little tobacco,\r\nwhich I would have him accept, being of my own produce.\r\n\r\nNeither was this all; but my goods being all English manufactures, such\r\nas cloth, stuffs, baize, and things particularly valuable and desirable\r\nin the country, I found means to sell them to a very great advantage;\r\nso that I may say I had more than four times the value of my first\r\ncargo, and was now infinitely beyond my poor neighbor, I mean in the\r\nadvancement of my plantation; for the first thing I did, I bought me a\r\nnegro slave, and an European servant also; I mean another besides that\r\nwhich the captain brought me from Lisbon.\r\n\r\nBut as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means of our\r\ngreatest adversity, so was it with me. I went on the next year with\r\ngreat success in my plantation. I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco\r\non my own ground, more than I had disposed of for necessaries among my\r\nneighbors; and these fifty rolls, being each of above a hundredweight,\r\nwere well cured, and laid by against the return of the fleet from\r\nLisbon. And now, increasing in business and in wealth, my head began\r\nto be full of projects and undertakings beyond my reach, such as are,\r\nindeed, often the ruin of the best heads in business. Had I continued\r\nin the station I was now in, I had room for all the happy things to\r\nhave yet befallen me for which my father so earnestly recommended a\r\nquiet, retired life, and of which he had so sensibly described the\r\nmiddle station of life to be full of. But other things attended me,\r\nand I was still to be the wilful agent of all my own miseries; and\r\nparticularly, to increase my fault and double the reflections upon\r\nmyself, which in my future sorrows I should have leisure to make. All\r\nthese miscarriages were procured by my apparent obstinate adhering\r\nto my foolish inclination of wandering abroad, and pursuing that\r\ninclination in contradiction to the clearest views of doing myself good\r\nin a fair and plain pursuit of those prospects, and those measures of\r\nlife, which Nature and Providence concurred to present me with, and to\r\nmake my duty.\r\n\r\nAs I had once done thus in my breaking away from my parents, so I could\r\nnot be content now, but I must go and leave the happy view I had of\r\nbeing a rich and thriving man in my new plantation, only to pursue a\r\nrash and immoderate desire of rising faster than the nature of the\r\nthing admitted; and thus I cast myself down again into the deepest gulf\r\nof human misery that ever man fell into, or perhaps could be consistent\r\nwith life and a state of health in the world.\r\n\r\nTo come then, by the just degrees to the particulars of this part of\r\nmy story. You may suppose, that having now lived almost four years in\r\nthe Brazils, and beginning to thrive and prosper very well upon my\r\nplantation, I had not only learned the language, but had contracted\r\nacquaintance and friendship among my fellow-planters, as well as among\r\nthe merchants at St. Salvador, which was our port, and that in my\r\ndiscourses among them I had frequently given them an account of my two\r\nvoyages to the coast of Guinea, the manner of trading with the negroes\r\nthere, and how easy it was to purchase upon the coast for trifles--such\r\nas beads, toys, knives, scissors, hatchets, bits of glass, and the\r\nlike--not only gold dust, Guinea grains, elephants’ teeth, etc., but\r\nnegroes, for the service of the Brazils, in great numbers.\r\n\r\nThey listened always very attentively to my discourses on these heads,\r\nbut especially to that part which related to the buying negroes; which\r\nwas a trade, at that time, not only not far entered into, but, as far\r\nas it was, had been carried on by the _assiento_, or permission, of the\r\nKings of Spain and Portugal, and engrossed in the public, so that few\r\nnegroes were bought, and those excessive dear.\r\n\r\nIt happened, being in company with some merchants and planters of my\r\nacquaintance, and talking of those things very earnestly, three of them\r\ncame to me the next morning, and told me they had been musing very much\r\nupon what I had discoursed with them of, the last night, and they came\r\nto make a secret proposal to me. And after enjoining me secrecy, they\r\ntold me that they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea; that\r\nthey had all plantations as well as I, and were straitened for nothing\r\nso much as servants; that as it was a trade that could not be carried\r\non because they could not publicly sell the negroes when they came\r\nhome, so they desired to make but one voyage, to bring the negroes on\r\nshore privately, and divide them among their own plantations; and, in a\r\nword, the question was, whether I would go as their supercargo in the\r\nship, to manage the trading part upon the coast of Guinea; and they\r\noffered me that I should have my equal share of the negroes without\r\nproviding any part of the stock.\r\n\r\nThis was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had it been made to\r\nany one that had not had a settlement and plantation of his own to\r\nlook after, which was in a fair way of coming to be very considerable,\r\nand with a good stock upon it. But for me, that was thus entered and\r\nestablished, and had nothing to do but go on as I had begun, for three\r\nor four years more, and to have sent for the other hundred pounds\r\nfrom England; and who, in that time, and with that little addition,\r\ncould scarce have failed of being worth three or four thousand pounds\r\nsterling, and that increasing too--for me to think of such a voyage,\r\nwas the most preposterous thing that ever man, in such circumstances,\r\ncould be guilty of.\r\n\r\nBut I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no more resist the\r\noffer than I could restrain my first rambling designs, when my father’s\r\ngood counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I told them I would go with\r\nall my heart, if they would undertake to look after my plantation in\r\nmy absence, and would dispose of it to such as I should direct if I\r\nmiscarried. This they all engaged to do, and entered into writings or\r\ncovenants to do so; I made a formal will, disposing of my plantation\r\nand effects, in case of my death; making the captain of the ship that\r\nhad saved my life, as before, my universal heir, but obliging him to\r\ndispose of my effects as I had directed in my will; one-half of the\r\nproduce being to himself, and the other to be shipped to England.\r\n\r\nIn short, I took all possible caution to preserve my effects, and keep\r\nup my plantation. Had I used half as much prudence to have looked\r\ninto my own interest, and have made a judgment of what I ought to\r\nhave done and not to have done, I had certainly never gone away from\r\nso prosperous an undertaking, leaving all the probable views of a\r\nthriving circumstance, and gone upon a voyage to sea, attended with\r\nall its common hazards, to say nothing of the reasons I had to expect\r\nparticular misfortunes to myself.\r\n\r\nBut I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of my fancy\r\nrather than my reason. And accordingly, the ship being fitted out, and\r\nthe cargo furnished, and all things done as by agreement by my partners\r\nin the voyage, I went on board in an evil hour, the first of September,\r\n1659, being the same day eight years that I went from my father and\r\nmother at Hull, in order to act the rebel to their authority, and the\r\nfool to my own interest.\r\n\r\nOur ship was about 120 tons burden, carried six guns and fourteen men,\r\nbesides the master, his boy, and myself. We had on board no large\r\ncargo of goods, except of such toys as were fit for our trade with\r\nthe negroes--such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and odd trifles,\r\nespecially little looking-glasses, knives, scissors, hatchets, and the\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nThe same day I went on board we set sail, standing away to the\r\nnorthward upon our own coast, with design to stretch over for the\r\nAfrican coast, when they came about 10 or 12 degrees of northern\r\nlatitude, which, it seems, was the manner of their course in those\r\ndays. We had very good weather, only excessive hot, all the way upon\r\nour own coast, till we came to the height of Cape St. Augustino, from\r\nwhence, keeping farther off at sea, we lost sight of land, and steered\r\nas if we were bound for the Isle Fernando de Noronha, holding our\r\ncourse N.E. by N., and leaving those isles on the east. In this course\r\nwe passed the line in about twelve days’ time, and were, by our last\r\nobservation, in 7 degrees 22 minutes northern latitude, when a violent\r\ntornado, or hurricane, took us quite out of our knowledge. It began\r\nfrom the south-east, came about to the north-west, and then settled\r\ninto the north-east, from whence it blew in such a terrible manner,\r\nthat for twelve days together we could do nothing but drive, and,\r\nscudding away before it, let it carry us wherever fate and the fury of\r\nthe winds directed; and during these twelve days, I need not say that I\r\nexpected every day to be swallowed up, nor, indeed, did any in the ship\r\nexpect to save their lives.\r\n\r\nIn this distress we had, besides the terror of the storm, one of\r\nour men die of the fever, and one man and the boy washed overboard.\r\nAbout the twelfth day, the weather abating a little, the master made\r\nan observation as well as he could, and found that he was in about\r\n11 degrees north latitude, but that he was 22 degrees of longitude\r\ndifference west from Cape St. Augustino; so that he found he was gotten\r\nupon the coast of Guiana, or the north part of Brazil, beyond the river\r\nAmazon, toward that of the river Orinoco, commonly called the Great\r\nRiver, and began to consult with me what course he should take, for the\r\nship was leaky and very much disabled, and he was going directly back\r\nto the coast of Brazil.\r\n\r\nI was positively against that; and looking over the charts of the\r\nsea-coast of America with him, we concluded there was no inhabited\r\ncountry for us to have recourse to till we came within the circle\r\nof the Caribbee Islands, and therefore resolved to stand away for\r\nBarbadoes, which by keeping off at sea, to avoid the indraft of the\r\nBay or Gulf of Mexico, we might easily perform, as we hoped, in about\r\nfifteen days’ sail; whereas we could not possibly make our voyage to\r\nthe coast of Africa without some assistance, both to our ship and to\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nWith this design we changed our course, and steered away N.W. by W. in\r\norder to reach some of our English islands, where I hoped for relief;\r\nbut our voyage was otherwise determined; for being in the latitude of\r\n12 degrees 18 minutes, a second storm came upon us, which carried us\r\naway with the same impetuosity westward, and drove us so out of the\r\nvery way of all human commerce, that had all our lives been saved, as\r\nto the sea, we were rather in danger of being devoured by savages than\r\never returning to our own country.\r\n\r\nIn this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our men\r\nearly in the morning cried out, “Land!” and we had no sooner ran\r\nout of our cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the\r\nworld we were, but the ship struck upon a sand, and in a moment, her\r\nmotion being so stopped, the sea broke over her in such a manner,\r\nthat we expected we should all have perished immediately; and we were\r\nimmediately driven into our close quarters, to shelter us from the very\r\nfoam and spray of the sea.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy for any one, who has not been in the like condition, to\r\ndescribe or conceive the consternation of men in such circumstances. We\r\nknew nothing where we were, or upon what land it was we were driven,\r\nwhether an island or the main, whether inhabited or not inhabited;\r\nand as the rage of the wind was still great, though rather less than\r\nat first, we could not so much as hope to have the ship hold many\r\nminutes without breaking in pieces, unless the winds, by a kind of\r\nmiracle, should turn immediately about. In a word, we sat looking one\r\nupon another, and expecting death every moment, and every man acting\r\naccordingly, as preparing for another world; for there was little or\r\nnothing more for us to do in this. That which was our present comfort,\r\nand all the comfort we had, was that, contrary to our expectation, the\r\nship did not break yet, and that the master said the wind began to\r\nabate.\r\n\r\nNow, though we thought that the wind did a little abate, yet the ship\r\nhaving thus struck upon the sand, and sticking too fast for us to\r\nexpect her getting off, we were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had\r\nnothing to do but to think of saving our lives as well as we could. We\r\nhad a boat at our stern just before the storm, but she was first staved\r\nby dashing against the ship’s rudder, and in the next place, she broke\r\naway, and either sunk, or was driven off to sea, so there was no hope\r\nfrom her; we had another boat on board, but how to get her off into the\r\nsea was a doubtful thing. However, there was no room to debate, for we\r\nfancied the ship would break in pieces every minute, and some told us\r\nshe was actually broken already.\r\n\r\nIn this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold of the boat, and\r\nwith the help of the rest of the men they got her slung over the ship’s\r\nside; and getting all into her, let go, and committed ourselves, being\r\neleven in number, to God’s mercy, and the wild sea; for though the\r\nstorm was abated considerably, yet the sea went dreadful high upon the\r\nshore, and might well be called _den wild zee_, as the Dutch call the\r\nsea in a storm.\r\n\r\nAnd now our case was very dismal indeed, for we all saw plainly that\r\nthe sea went so high, that the boat could not live, and that we should\r\nbe inevitably drowned. As to making sail, we had none; nor, if we had,\r\ncould we have done anything with it; so we worked at the oar toward the\r\nland, though with heavy hearts, like men going to execution, for we\r\nall knew that when the boat came nearer the shore, she would be dashed\r\nin a thousand pieces by the breach of the sea. However, we committed\r\nour souls to God in the most earnest manner; and the wind driving us\r\ntowards the shore, we hastened our destruction with our own hands,\r\npulling as well as we could towards land.\r\n\r\nWhat the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether steep or shoal, we\r\nknew not; the only hope that could rationally give us the least shadow\r\nof expectation was, if we may happen into some Bay or Gulf, or the\r\nmouth of some river, where by great chance we might have run our boat\r\nin, or got under the lee of the land, and perhaps made smooth water.\r\nBut there was nothing of this appeared; but as we made nearer and\r\nnearer the shore, the land looked more frightful than the sea.\r\n\r\nAfter we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league and a half, as we\r\nreckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, came rolling astern of us,\r\nand plainly bade us expect the _coup de grâce_. In a word, it took us\r\nwith such a fury that it overset the boat at once; and separating us,\r\nas well from the boat as from one another, gave us not time hardly to\r\nsay, “O God!” for we were all swallowed up in a moment.\r\n\r\nNothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt when I sunk\r\ninto the water; for though I swam very well, yet I could not deliver\r\nmyself from the waves so as to draw breath, till that wave having\r\ndriven me, or rather carried me, a vast way on towards the shore, and\r\nhaving spent itself, went back, and left me upon the land almost dry,\r\nbut half dead with the water I took in. I had so much presence of mind\r\nas well as breath left, that seeing myself nearer the mainland than I\r\nexpected, I got upon my feet, and endeavored to make on towards the\r\nland as fast as I could, before another wave should return and take me\r\nup again. But I soon found it was impossible to avoid it; for I saw the\r\nsea come after me as high as a great hill, and as furious as an enemy,\r\nwhich I had no means or strength to contend with. My business was to\r\nhold my breath, and raise myself upon the water, if I could; and so, by\r\nswimming, to preserve my breathing, and pilot myself towards the shore,\r\nif possible; my greatest concern now being, that the sea, as it would\r\ncarry me a great way towards the shore when it came on, might not carry\r\nme back again with it when it gave back towards the sea.\r\n\r\nThe wave that came upon me again, buried me at once 20 or 30 feet\r\ndeep in its own body, and I could feel myself carried with a mighty\r\nforce and swiftness towards the shore a very great way; but I held my\r\nbreath, and assisted myself to swim still forward with all my might.\r\nI was ready to burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt myself\r\nrising up, so, to my immediate relief, I found my head and hands shoot\r\nout above the surface of the water; and though it was not two seconds\r\nof time that I could keep myself so, yet it relieved me greatly, gave\r\nme breath and new courage. I was covered again with water a good while,\r\nbut not so long but I held it out; and finding the water had spent\r\nitself, and began to return, I struck forward against the return of\r\nthe waves, and felt the ground again with my feet. I stood still a few\r\nmoments to recover breath, and till the water went from me, and then\r\ntook to my heels and ran with what strength I had farther towards the\r\nshore. But neither would this deliver me from the fury of the sea,\r\nwhich came pouring in after me again, and twice more I was lifted up by\r\nthe waves and carried forwards as before, the shore being very flat.\r\n\r\nThe last time of these two had well near been fatal to me; for the\r\nsea, having hurried me along as before, landed me, or rather dashed\r\nme, against a piece of a rock and that with such force as it left me\r\nsenseless, and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance; for the blow\r\ntaking my side and breast beat the breath as it were quite out of my\r\nbody; and had it returned again immediately, I must have been strangled\r\nin the water. But I recovered a little before the return of the waves,\r\nand seeing I should be covered again with the water, I resolved to hold\r\nfast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible,\r\ntill the wave went back. Now as the waves were not so high as at\r\nfirst, being near land, I held my hold till the wave abated and then\r\nfetched another run, which brought me so near the shore, that the next\r\nwave though it went over me yet did not swallow me up as to carry me\r\naway, and the next run I took I got to the mainland, where to my great\r\ncomfort I clambered up the cliffs of the shore, and sat me down upon\r\nthe grass, free from danger and quite out of the reach of the water.\r\n\r\nI was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to look up and thank God\r\nthat my life was saved in a case wherein there was some minutes before\r\nscarce any room to hope. I believe it is impossible to express to the\r\nlife what the ecstasies and transports of the soul are when it is so\r\nsaved, as I may say, out of the very grave; and I do not wonder now\r\nat that custom, viz., that when a malefactor who has the halter about\r\nhis neck is tied up and just going to be turned off and has a reprieve\r\nbrought to him--I say, I do not wonder that they bring a surgeon with\r\nit, to let his blood that every moment they tell him of it, that the\r\nsurprise may not drive the animal spirits from his heart, and overwhelm\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n            For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first.\r\n\r\nI walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands, and my whole being,\r\nas I may say, wrapt up in the contemplation of my deliverance, making a\r\nthousand gestures and motions which I cannot describe, reflecting upon\r\nall my comrades that were drowned, and that there should not be one\r\nsoul saved but myself; for, as for them, I never saw them afterwards,\r\nor any sign of them except three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes\r\nthat were not fellows.\r\n\r\nI cast my eyes to the stranded vessel when the breach and froth of\r\nthe sea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far off, and\r\nconsidered, Lord! how was it possible I could get on shore?\r\n\r\nAfter I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my condition\r\nI began to look round me to see what kind of place I was in, and what\r\nwas next to be done, and I soon found my comforts abate, and that in\r\na word I had a dreadful deliverance; for I was wet, had no clothes to\r\nshift me, nor anything to eat or drink to comfort me, neither did I\r\nsee any prospect before me but that of perishing with hunger, or being\r\ndevoured by wild beasts; and that which was particularly afflicting\r\nto me was that I had no weapon either to hunt and kill any creature\r\nfor my sustenance, or to defend myself against any other creature that\r\nmight desire to kill me for theirs. In a word, I had nothing about me\r\nbut a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box. This was\r\nall my provision; and this threw me into terrible agonies of mind that\r\nfor a while I ran about like a madman. Night coming upon me, I began,\r\nwith a heavy heart, to consider what would be my lot if there were\r\nany ravenous beasts in that country, seeing at night they always come\r\nabroad for their prey.\r\n\r\nAll the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that time was, to get up\r\ninto a thick bushy tree like a fir, but thorny, which grew near me, and\r\nwhere I resolved to sit all night, and consider the next day what death\r\nI should die, for as yet I saw no prospect of life. I walked about\r\na furlong from the shore, to see if I could find any fresh water to\r\ndrink, which I did, to my great joy; and having drank, and put a little\r\ntobacco in my mouth to prevent hunger, I went to the tree, and getting\r\nup into it, endeavored to place myself so, as that if I should sleep I\r\nmight not fall; and having cut me a short stick, like a truncheon, for\r\nmy defence, I took up my lodging, and having been excessively fatigued,\r\nI fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably as, I believe, few could\r\nhave done in my condition, and found myself the most refreshed with it\r\nthat I think I ever was on such an occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n_Robinson Finds Himself on a Desolate Island and Procures a Stock of\r\nArticles from the Wreck--He Constructs His Habitation_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and the storm abated,\r\nso that the sea did not rage and swell as before. But that which\r\nsurprised me most was, that the ship was lifted off in the night from\r\nthe sand where she lay, by the swelling of the tide, and was driven up\r\nalmost as far as the rock which I first mentioned, where I had been\r\nso bruised by the dashing me against it. This being within about a\r\nmile from the shore where I was, and the ship seeming to stand upright\r\nstill, I wished myself on board, that, at least, I might have some\r\nnecessary things for my use.\r\n\r\nWhen I came down from my apartment in the tree I looked about me again\r\nand the first thing I found was the boat, which lay as the wind and the\r\nsea had tossed her up upon the land, about two miles on my right hand.\r\nI walked as far as I could upon the shore to have got to her, but found\r\na neck or inlet of water between me and the boat, which was about half\r\na mile broad; so I came back for the present, being more intent upon\r\ngetting at the ship, where I hoped to find something for my present\r\nsubsistence.\r\n\r\nA little after noon I found the sea very calm, and the tide ebbed so\r\nfar out, that I could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship; and\r\nhere I found a fresh renewing of my grief, for I saw evidently, that\r\nif we had kept on board we had been all safe, that is to say, we had\r\nall got safe on shore, and I had not been so miserable as to be left\r\nentirely destitute of all comfort and company as I now was. This forced\r\ntears from my eyes again; but as there was little relief in that, I\r\nresolved, if possible, to get to the ship; so I pulled off my clothes,\r\nfor the weather was hot to extremity, and took the water. But when I\r\ncame to the ship my difficulty was still greater to know how to get on\r\nboard; for as she lay aground, and high out of the water, there was\r\nnothing within my reach to lay hold of. I swam round her twice, and the\r\nsecond time I spied a small piece of a rope, which I wondered I did not\r\nsee at first, hang down by the fore-chains so low, as that with great\r\ndifficulty I got hold of it, and by the help of that rope got up into\r\nthe forecastle of the ship. Here I found that the ship was bulged, and\r\nhad a great deal of water in her hold, but that she lay so on the side\r\nof a bank of hard sand, or rather earth, that her stern lay lifted up\r\nupon the bank, and her head low almost to the water. By this means all\r\nher quarter was free, and all that was in that part was dry; for you\r\nmay be sure my first work was to search and to see what was spoiled and\r\nwhat was free. And first I found that all the ship’s provisions were\r\ndry and untouched by the water; and being very well disposed to eat, I\r\nwent to the bread-room and filled my pockets with biscuit, and ate it\r\nas I went about other things, for I had no time to lose. I also found\r\nsome rum in the great cabin, of which I took a large dram, and which I\r\nhad indeed need enough of, to spirit me for what was before me. Now I\r\nwanted nothing but a boat, to furnish myself with many things which I\r\nforesaw would be very necessary to me.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had, and\r\nthis extremity roused my application. We had several spare yards, and\r\ntwo or three large spars of wood, and a spare top-mast or two in the\r\nship. I resolved to fall to work with these, and flung as many of them\r\noverboard as I could manage for their weight, tying every one with a\r\nrope, that they might not drive away. When this was done I went down\r\nthe ship’s side, and pulling them to me, I tied four of them fast\r\ntogether at both ends as well as I could, in the form of a raft; and\r\nlaying two or three shore pieces of plank upon them crossways, I found\r\nI could walk upon it very well, but that it was not able to bear any\r\ngreat weight, the pieces being too light. So I went to work, and with\r\nthe carpenter’s saw I cut a spare top-mast into three lengths, and\r\nadded them to my raft, with a great deal of labor and pains; but hope\r\nof furnishing myself with the necessaries encouraged me to go beyond\r\nwhat I should have been able to have done upon another occasion.\r\n\r\nMy raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight. My next\r\ncare was what to load it with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it\r\nfrom the surf of the sea; but I was not long considering this. I first\r\nlaid all the planks or boards upon it that I could get, and having\r\nconsidered well what I most wanted, I first got three of the seamen’s\r\nchests which I had broken open and emptied, and lowered them down upon\r\nmy raft. The first of these I filled with provisions, viz., bread,\r\nrice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goat’s flesh, which\r\nwe lived much upon, and a little remainder of European corn which had\r\nbeen laid by for some fowls which we brought to sea with us, but the\r\nfowls were killed. There had been some barley and wheat together, but,\r\nto my great disappointment, I found afterwards that the rats had eaten\r\nor spoiled it all. As for liquors I found several cases of bottles\r\nbelonging to our skipper in which were some cordial waters, and, in\r\nall, about five or six gallons of rack. These I stowed by themselves,\r\nthere being no need to put them into the chest, nor no room for them.\r\nWhile I was doing this, I found the tide began to flow, though very\r\ncalm, and I had the mortification to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat,\r\nwhich I had left on shore upon the sand, swim away; as for my breeches,\r\nwhich were only linen, and open-kneed, I swam on board in them and my\r\nstockings. However, this put me upon rummaging for clothes, of which\r\nI found enough, but took no more than I wanted for present use; for I\r\nhad other things which my eye was more upon, as first tools to work\r\nwith on shore; and it was after long searching that I found out the\r\ncarpenter’s desk, which was indeed a very useful prize to me, and much\r\nmore valuable than a ship-loading of gold would have been at that time.\r\nI got it down to my raft, even whole as it was, without losing time to\r\nlook into it, for I knew in general what it contained.\r\n\r\nMy next care was for some ammunition and arms; there were two very good\r\nfowling-pieces in the great cabin, and two pistols; these I secured\r\nfirst, with some powder-horns, and a small bag of shot, and two old\r\nrusty swords. I knew there were three barrels of powder in the ship,\r\nbut knew not where our gunner had stowed them; but with much search I\r\nfound them, two of them dry and good, the third had taken water; those\r\ntwo I got to my raft with the arms. And now I thought myself pretty\r\nwell freighted, and began to think how I should get to shore with them,\r\nhaving neither sail, oar, nor rudder; and the least capful of wind\r\nwould have overset all my navigation.\r\n\r\nI had three encouragements. 1. A smooth, calm sea. 2. The tide rising\r\nand setting in to the shore. 3. What little wind there was blew me\r\ntowards the land. And thus, having found two or three broken oars\r\nbelonging to the boat, and besides the tools which were in the chest, I\r\nfound two saws, an axe, and a hammer, and with this cargo I put to sea.\r\nFor a mile or thereabouts my raft went very well, only that I found\r\nit drive a little distant from the place where I had landed before,\r\nby which I perceived that there was some indraft of the water, and\r\nconsequently I hoped to find some creek or river there, which I might\r\nmake use of as a port to get to land with my cargo.\r\n\r\nAs I imagined, so it was; there appeared before me a little opening of\r\nthe land, and I found a strong current of the tide set into it, so I\r\nguided my raft as well as I could to keep in the middle of the stream.\r\nBut here I had like to have suffered a second shipwreck, which, if I\r\nhad, I think verily would have broke my heart; for knowing nothing of\r\nthe coast my raft ran aground at one end of it upon a shoal, and not\r\nbeing aground at the other end, it wanted but a little that all my\r\ncargo had slipped off towards that end that was afloat, and so fallen\r\ninto the water. I did my utmost by setting my back against the chests\r\nto keep them in their places, but could not thrust off the raft with\r\nall my strength, neither durst I stir from the posture I was in, but\r\nholding up the chests with all my might, stood in that manner near half\r\nan hour, in which time the rising of the water brought me a little\r\nmore upon a level; and a little after, the water still rising, my\r\nraft floated again, and I thrust her off with the oar I had into the\r\nchannel, and then driving up higher, I at length found myself in the\r\nmouth of a little river, with land on both sides, and a strong current\r\nor tide running up. I looked on both sides for a proper place to get to\r\nshore, for I was not willing to be driven too high up the river, hoping\r\nin time to see some ship at sea, and therefore resolved to place myself\r\nas near the coast as I could.\r\n\r\nAt length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek, to\r\nwhich, with great pain and difficulty, I guided my raft, and at last\r\ngot so near, as that, reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust her\r\ndirectly in; but here I had like to have dipped all my cargo in the\r\nsea again; for that shore lying pretty steep, that is to say, sloping,\r\nthere was no place to land but where one end of my float, if it run on\r\nshore, would lie so high and the other sink lower, as before, that it\r\nwould endanger my cargo again. All that I could do was to wait till the\r\ntide was at the highest, keeping the raft with my oar like an anchor\r\nto hold the side of it fast to the shore, near a flat piece of ground,\r\nwhich I expected the water would flow over; and so it did. As soon as I\r\nfound water enough, for my raft drew about a foot of water, I thrust\r\nher on upon that flat piece of ground, and there fastened or moored her\r\nby sticking my two broken oars into the ground; one on one side near\r\none end, and one on the other side near the other end; and thus I lay\r\ntill the water ebbed away, and left my raft and all my cargo safe on\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nMy next work was to view the country and seek a proper place for my\r\nhabitation, and where to stow my goods to secure them from whatever\r\nmight happen. Where I was, I yet knew not; whether on the continent, or\r\non an island; whether inhabited, or not inhabited; whether in danger\r\nof wild beasts, or not. There was a hill, not above a mile from me,\r\nwhich rose up very steep and high, and which seemed to overtop some\r\nother hills, which lay as in a ridge from it, northward. I took out one\r\nof the fowling-pieces and one of the pistols, and a horn of powder;\r\nand thus armed, I travelled for discovery up to the top of that hill,\r\nwhere, after I had with great labor and difficulty got to the top,\r\nI saw my fate to my great affliction, viz., that I was on an island\r\nenvironed every way with the sea, no land to be seen, except some rocks\r\nwhich lay a great way off, and two small islands less than this, which\r\nlay about three leagues to the west.\r\n\r\nI found also that the island I was on was barren, and, as I saw good\r\nreason to believe, uninhabited, except by wild beasts, of whom,\r\nhowever, I saw none; yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew not their\r\nkinds; neither, when I killed them, could I tell what was fit for food,\r\nand what not. At my coming back, I shot at a great bird which I saw\r\nsitting upon a tree on the side of a great wood. I believe it was the\r\nfirst gun that had been fired there since the creation of the world. I\r\nhad no sooner fired, but from all the parts of the wood there arose an\r\ninnumerable number of fowls of many sorts, making a confused screaming,\r\nand crying every one according to his usual note; but not one of them\r\nof any kind that I knew. As for the creature I killed, I took it to be\r\na kind of a hawk, its color and beak resembling it, but had no talons\r\nor claws more than common; its flesh was carrion, and fit for nothing.\r\n\r\nContented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and fell to work\r\nto bring my cargo on shore, which took me the rest of that day; and\r\nwhat to do with myself at night, I knew not, nor indeed where to rest;\r\nfor I was afraid to lie down on the ground, not knowing but some wild\r\nbeast might devour me, though, as I afterwards found, there was really\r\nno need for those fears. However, as well as I could, I barricaded\r\nmyself round with the chests and boards that I had brought on shore,\r\nand made a kind of a hut for that night’s lodging; as for food, I yet\r\nsaw not which way to supply myself, except that I had seen two or three\r\ncreatures like hares run out of the woods where I shot the fowl.\r\n\r\nI now began to consider, that I might yet get a great many things out\r\nof the ship, which would be useful to me, and particularly some of the\r\nrigging and sails, and such other things as might come to land; and I\r\nresolved to make another voyage on board the vessel, if possible. And\r\nas I knew that the first storm that blew must necessarily break her\r\nall in pieces, I resolved to set all other things apart till I got\r\neverything out of the ship that I could get. Then I called a council,\r\nthat is to say, in my thoughts, whether I should take back the raft,\r\nbut this appeared impracticable; so I resolved to go as before, when\r\nthe tide was down; and I did so, only that I stripped before I went\r\nfrom my hut, having nothing on but a checkered shirt and a pair of\r\nlinen drawers, and a pair of pumps on my feet.\r\n\r\nI got on board the ship as before, and prepared a second raft, and\r\nhaving had experience of the first, I neither made this so unwieldy,\r\nnor loaded it so hard; but yet I brought away several things very\r\nuseful to me; as, first, in the carpenter’s store I found two or three\r\nbags full of nails and spikes, a great screw-jack, a dozen or two of\r\nhatchets, and above all that most useful thing called a grindstone.\r\nAll these I secured, together with several things belonging to the\r\ngunner, particularly two or three iron crows, and two barrels of musket\r\nbullets, seven muskets, and another fowling-piece, with some small\r\nquantity of powder more; a large bag full of small-shot, and a great\r\nroll of sheet lead; but this last was so heavy, I could not hoist it up\r\nto get it over the ship’s side. Besides these things, I took all the\r\nmen’s clothes that I could find, and a spare fore-top sail, a hammock,\r\nand some bedding, and with this I loaded my second raft, and brought\r\nthem all safe on shore, to my very great comfort.\r\n\r\nI was under some apprehensions during my absence from the land, that\r\nat least my provisions might be devoured on shore; but when I came\r\nback, I found no sign of any visitor, only there sat a creature like\r\na wild cat upon one of the chests, which, when I came towards it, ran\r\naway a little distance, and then stood still. She sat very composed\r\nand unconcerned, and looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to\r\nbe acquainted with me. I presented my gun at her; but as she did not\r\nunderstand it, she was perfectly unconcerned at it, nor did she offer\r\nto stir away; upon which I tossed her a bit of biscuit, though, by the\r\nway, I was not very free of it, for my store was not great. However, I\r\nspared her a bit, I say, and she went to it, smelled of it, and ate it\r\nand looked (as pleased) for more; but I thanked her and could spare no\r\nmore, so she marched off.\r\n\r\nHaving got my second cargo on shore, though I was fain to open the\r\nbarrels of powder and bring them by parcels, for they were too heavy,\r\nbeing large casks, I went to work to make me a little tent with the\r\nsail and some poles which I cut for that purpose; and into this tent I\r\nbrought everything that I knew would spoil either with rain or sun; and\r\nI piled all the empty chests and casks up in a circle round the tent,\r\nto fortify it from any sudden attempt, either from man or beast.\r\n\r\nWhen I had done this I blocked up the door of the tent with some boards\r\nwithin, and an empty chest set up on end without; and spreading one of\r\nthe beds upon the ground, laying my two pistols just at my head, and my\r\ngun at length by me, I went to bed for the first time, and slept very\r\nquietly all night, for I was very weary and heavy; for the night before\r\nI had slept little, and had labored very hard all day, as well to fetch\r\nall those things from the ship, as to get them on shore.\r\n\r\nI had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever was laid up, I\r\nbelieve, for one man; but I was not satisfied still, for while the ship\r\nsat upright in that posture, I thought I ought to get everything out\r\nof her that I could. So every day at low water I went on board, and\r\nbrought away something or other; but, particularly, the third time I\r\nwent I brought away as much of the rigging as I could, as also all the\r\nsmall ropes and rope-twine I could get, with a piece of spare canvas,\r\nwhich was to mend the sails upon occasion, the barrel of wet gunpowder;\r\nin a word, I brought away all the sails first and last, only that I was\r\nfain to cut them in pieces, and bring as much at a time as I could; for\r\nthey were no more useful to be sails, but as mere canvas only.\r\n\r\nBut that which comforted me more still was, that at last of all, after\r\nI had made five or six such voyages as these, and thought I had nothing\r\nmore to expect from the ship that was worth my meddling with; I say,\r\nafter all this, I found a great hogshead of bread, and three large\r\nrunlets of rum or spirits and a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine\r\nflour; this was surprising to me, because I had given over expecting\r\nany more provisions, except what was spoilt by the water. I soon\r\nemptied the hogshead of that bread, and wrapped it up parcel by parcel\r\nin pieces of the sails, which I cut out; and, in a word, I got all this\r\nsafe on shore also.\r\n\r\nThe next day I made another voyage. And now, having plundered the ship\r\nof what was portable and fit to hand out, I began with the cables;\r\nand cutting the great cable into pieces, such as I could move, I got\r\ntwo cables and a hawser on shore, with all the iron-work I could get;\r\nand having cut down the sprit-sail-yard, and the mizzen-yard, and\r\neverything I could to make a large raft, I loaded it with all those\r\nheavy goods, and came away. But my good luck began now to leave me;\r\nfor this raft was so unwieldy, and so overladen, that after I was\r\nentered the little cove where I had landed the rest of my goods, not\r\nbeing able to guide it so handily as I did the other, it overset,\r\nand threw me and all my cargo into the water. As for myself, it was\r\nno great harm, for I was near the shore; but as to my cargo, it was\r\ngreat part of it lost, especially the iron, which I expected would\r\nhave been of great use to me. However, when the tide was out I got\r\nmost of the pieces of cable ashore, and some of the iron, though with\r\ninfinite labor; for I was fain to dip for it into the water, a work\r\nwhich fatigued me very much. After this I went every day on board, and\r\nbrought away what I could get.\r\n\r\nI had been now thirteen days on shore, and had been eleven times on\r\nboard the ship; in which time I had brought away all that one pair\r\nof hands could well be supposed capable to bring, though I believe\r\nverily, had the calm weather held, I should have brought away the whole\r\nship piece by piece. But preparing the twelfth time to go on board, I\r\nfound the wind begin to rise. However, at low water I went on board,\r\nand though I thought I had rummaged the cabin so effectually as that\r\nnothing more could be found, yet I discovered a locker with drawers\r\nin it, in one of which I found two or three razors, and one pair of\r\nlarge scissors, with some ten or a dozen of good knives and forks; in\r\nanother, I found about thirty-six pounds value in money, some European\r\ncoin, some Brazil, some pieces of eight, some gold, some silver.\r\n\r\nI smiled to myself at the sight of this money. “O drug!” said I aloud,\r\n“what art thou good for? Thou art not worth to me, no, not the taking\r\noff of the ground; one of those knives is worth all this heap. I have\r\nno manner of use for thee; even remain where thou art, and go to the\r\nbottom as a creature whose life is not worth saving.” However, upon\r\nsecond thoughts, I took it away; and wrapping all this in a piece\r\nof canvas, I began to think of making another raft; but while I was\r\npreparing this, I found the sky overcast, and the wind began to rise,\r\nand in a quarter of an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore. It\r\npresently occurred to me that it was in vain to pretend to make a raft\r\nwith the wind off shore, and that it was my business to be gone before\r\nthe tide of flood began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the\r\nshore at all. Accordingly I let myself down into the water, and swam\r\nacross the channel, which lay between the ship and the sands, and even\r\nthat with difficulty enough, partly with the weight of the things I had\r\nabout me, and partly the roughness of the water; for the wind rose very\r\nhastily, and before it was quite high water it blew a storm.\r\n\r\nBut I was gotten home to my little tent, where I lay with all my wealth\r\nabout me very secure. It blew very hard all that night, and in the\r\nmorning, when I looked out, behold, no more ship was to be seen. I\r\nwas a little surprised, but recovered myself with this satisfactory\r\nreflection, viz., that I had lost no time, nor abated no diligence, to\r\nget everything out of her that could be useful to me, and that indeed\r\nthere was little left in her that I was able to bring away if I had had\r\nmore time.\r\n\r\nI now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of anything out of\r\nher, except what might drive on shore from her wreck, as indeed divers\r\npieces of her afterwards did; but those things were of small use to me.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts were now wholly employed about securing myself against\r\neither savages, if any should appear, or wild beasts, if any were in\r\nthe island; and I had many thoughts of the method how to do this, and\r\nwhat kind of dwelling to make, whether I should make me a cave in the\r\nearth, or a tent upon the earth; and, in short, I resolved upon both,\r\nthe manner and description of which it may not be improper to give an\r\naccount of.\r\n\r\nI soon found the place I was in was not for my settlement, particularly\r\nbecause it was upon a low moorish ground near the sea, and I believed\r\nwould not be wholesome; and more particularly because there was no\r\nfresh water near it. So I resolved to find a more healthy and more\r\nconvenient spot of ground.\r\n\r\nI consulted several things in my situation, which I found would be\r\nproper for me. First, health and fresh water, I just now mentioned.\r\nSecondly, shelter from the heat of the sun. Thirdly, security from\r\nravenous creatures, whether men or beasts. Fourthly, a view to the sea,\r\nthat if God sent any ship in sight I might not lose any advantage for\r\nmy deliverance, of which I was not willing to banish all my expectation\r\nyet.\r\n\r\nIn search of a place proper for this, I found a little plain on the\r\nside of a rising hill, whose front towards this little plain was steep\r\nas a house-side, so that nothing could come down upon me from the top;\r\non the side of this rock there was a hollow place, worn a little way\r\nin, like the entrance or door of a cave; but there was not really any\r\ncave, or way into the rock at all.\r\n\r\nOn the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I resolved to\r\npitch my tent. This plain was not above an hundred yards broad, and\r\nabout twice as long, and lay like a green before my door, and at the\r\nend of it descended irregularly every way down into the low grounds\r\nby the seaside. It was on the N.N.W. side of the hill, so that I was\r\nsheltered from the heat every day, till it came to a W. and by S. sun,\r\nor thereabouts, which in those countries is near the setting.\r\n\r\nBefore I set up my tent, I drew a half circle before the hollow place,\r\nwhich took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter from the rock, and\r\ntwenty yards in its diameter from its beginning and ending. In this\r\nhalf-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving them into the\r\nground till they stood very firm like piles, the biggest end being out\r\nof the ground about five feet and a half, and sharpened on the top. The\r\ntwo rows did not stand above six inches from one another.\r\n\r\nThen I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the ship, and laid\r\nthem in rows one upon another, within the circle, between these two\r\nrows of stakes, up to the top, placing other stakes in the inside\r\nleaning against them, about two feet and a half high, like a spur to a\r\npost; and this fence was so strong, that neither man nor beast could\r\nget into it, or over it. This cost me a great deal of time and labor,\r\nespecially to cut the piles in the woods, bring them to the place, and\r\ndrive them into the earth.\r\n\r\nThe entrance into this place I made to be not by a door, but by a short\r\nladder, to go over the top; which ladder, when I was in, I lifted\r\nover after me, and so I was completely fenced in, and fortified, as\r\nI thought, from all the world, and consequently slept secure in the\r\nnight, which otherwise I could not have done; though, as it appeared\r\nafterwards, there was no need of all this caution from the enemies that\r\nI apprehended danger from.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n_Robinson Carries all His Riches, Provisions, etc., into His\r\nHabitation--Dreariness of Solitude--Consolatory Reflections_\r\n\r\n\r\nInto this fence or fortress, with infinite labor, I carried all my\r\nriches, all my provisions, ammunition, and stores, of which you have\r\nthe account above; and I made me a large tent, which, to preserve me\r\nfrom the rains that in one part of the year are very violent there, I\r\nmade double, viz., one smaller tent within, and one larger tent above\r\nit, and covered the uppermost with a large tarpaulin, which I had saved\r\namong the sails. And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I\r\nhad brought on shore, but in a hammock, which was indeed a very good\r\none, and belonged to the mate of the ship.\r\n\r\nInto this tent I brought all my provisions, and everything that would\r\nspoil by the wet; and having thus enclosed all my goods, I made up the\r\nentrance, which, till now, I had left open, and so passed and repassed,\r\nas I said, by a short ladder.\r\n\r\nWhen I had done this, I began to work my way into the rock; and\r\nbringing all the earth and stones that I dug down out through my tent,\r\nI laid them up within my fence in the nature of a terrace, so that it\r\nraised the ground within about a foot and a half; and thus I made me a\r\ncave just behind my tent, which served me like a cellar to my house.\r\n\r\nIt cost me much labor, and many days, before all these things were\r\nbrought to perfection, and therefore I must go back to some other\r\nthings which took up some of my thoughts. At the same time it happened,\r\nafter I had laid my scheme for the setting up my tent, and making the\r\ncave, that a storm of rain falling from a thick dark cloud, a sudden\r\nflash of lightning happened, and after that a great clap of thunder,\r\nas is naturally the effect of it. I was not so much surprised with the\r\nlightning, as I was with a thought which darted into my mind as swift\r\nas the lightning itself. O my powder! My very heart sunk within me\r\nwhen I thought, that at one blast all my powder might be destroyed, on\r\nwhich, not my defence only, but the providing me food, as I thought,\r\nentirely depended. I was nothing near so anxious about my own danger;\r\nthough had the powder took fire, I had never known who had hurt me.\r\n\r\nSuch impression did this make upon me, that after the storm was over\r\nI laid aside all my works, my building, and fortifying, and applied\r\nmyself to make bags and boxes to separate the powder, and keep it a\r\nlittle and a little in a parcel, in hope that whatever might come\r\nit might not all take fire at once, and to keep it so apart, that\r\nit should not be possible to make one part fire another. I finished\r\nthis work in about a fortnight; and I think my powder, which in all\r\nwas about 240 pounds weight, was divided in not less than a hundred\r\nparcels. As to the barrel that had been wet, I did not apprehend any\r\ndanger from that, so I placed it in my new cave, which in my fancy I\r\ncalled my kitchen, and the rest I hid up and down in holes among the\r\nrocks, so that no wet might come to it, marking very carefully where I\r\nlaid it.\r\n\r\nIn the interval of time while this was doing, I went out once, at\r\nleast, every day with my gun, as well to divert myself, as to see if I\r\ncould kill anything fit for food, and as near as I could to acquaint\r\nmyself with what the island produced. The first time I went out, I\r\npresently discovered that there were goats in the island, which was a\r\ngreat satisfaction to me; but then it was attended with this misfortune\r\nto me, viz., that they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot,\r\nthat it was the difficultest thing in the world to come at them. But\r\nI was not discouraged at this, not doubting but I might now and then\r\nshoot one, as it soon happened; for after I had found their haunts a\r\nlittle, I laid wait in this manner for them. I observed if they saw me\r\nin the valleys, though they were upon the rocks, they would run away as\r\nin a terrible fright; but if they were feeding in the valleys, and I\r\nwas upon the rocks, they took no notice of me, from whence I concluded\r\nthat, by the position of their optics, their sight was so directed\r\ndownward, that they did not readily see objects that were above them.\r\nSo afterwards I took this method; I always climbed the rocks first to\r\nget above them, and then had frequently a fair mark. The first shot I\r\nmade among these creatures I killed a she-goat, which had a little kid\r\nby her, which she gave suck to, which grieved me heartily; but when the\r\nold one fell, the kid stood stock still by her till I came and took\r\nher up; and not only so, but when I carried the old one with me upon\r\nmy shoulder, the kid followed me quite to my enclosure; upon which I\r\nlaid down the dam, and took the kid in my arms, and carried it over my\r\npale, in hopes to have bred it up tame; but it would not eat, so I was\r\nforced to kill it, and eat it myself. These two supplied me with flesh\r\na great while, for I ate sparingly, and saved my provisions, my bread\r\nespecially, as much as possibly I could.\r\n\r\nHaving now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely necessary to\r\nprovide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to burn; and what I did for\r\nthat, as also how I enlarged my cave, and what conveniences I made, I\r\nshall give a full account of in its place. But I must first give some\r\nlittle account of myself, and of my thoughts about living, which it may\r\nwell be supposed were not a few.\r\n\r\nI had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I was not cast away\r\nupon that island without being driven, as is said, by a violent storm,\r\nquite out of the course of our intended voyage, and a great way, viz.,\r\nsome hundreds of leagues out of the ordinary course of the trade of\r\nmankind, I had great reason to consider it as a determination of\r\nHeaven, that in this desolate place, and in this desolate manner, I\r\nshould end my life. The tears would run plentifully down my face when I\r\nmade these reflections, and sometimes I would expostulate with myself,\r\nwhy Providence should thus completely ruin its creatures, and render\r\nthem so absolutely miserable, so without help abandoned, so entirely\r\ndepressed, that it could hardly be rational to be thankful for such a\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nBut something always returned swift upon me to check these thoughts,\r\nand to reprove me; and particularly one day, walking with my gun in my\r\nhand by the seaside, I was very pensive upon the subject of my present\r\ncondition, when Reason, as it were, expostulated with me t’other way,\r\nthus: “Well, you are in a desolate condition, it is true, but pray\r\nremember, where are the rest of you? Did not you come eleven of you\r\ninto the boat? Where are the ten? Why were they not saved, and you\r\nlost? Why were you singled out? Is it better to be here, or there?” And\r\nthen I pointed to the sea. All evils are to be considered with the good\r\nthat is in them, and with what worse attends them.\r\n\r\nThen it occurred to me again, how I was furnished for my subsistence,\r\nand what would have been my case if it had not happened, which was an\r\nhundred thousand to one, that the ship floated from the place where\r\nshe first struck and was driven so near to the shore that I had time\r\nto get all these things out of her; what would have been my case, if\r\nI had been to have lived in the condition in which I at first came\r\non shore, without necessaries of life, or necessaries to supply and\r\nprocure them? “Particularly,” said I aloud (though to myself), “what\r\nshould I have done without a gun, without ammunition, without any tools\r\nto make anything or to work with, without clothes, bedding, a tent, or\r\nany manner of covering?” and that now I had all these to a sufficient\r\nquantity, and was in a fair way to provide myself in such a manner, as\r\nto live without my gun when my ammunition was spent; so that I had a\r\ntolerable view of subsisting without any want as long as I lived. For\r\nI considered from the beginning how I would provide for the accidents\r\nthat might happen, and for the time that was to come, even not only\r\nafter my ammunition should be spent, but even after my health or\r\nstrength should decay.\r\n\r\nI confess I had not entertained any notion of my ammunition being\r\ndestroyed at one blast--I mean, my powder being blown up by lightning;\r\nand this made the thoughts of it so surprising to me when it lightened\r\nand thundered, as I observed just now.\r\n\r\nAnd now being to enter into a melancholy relation of a scene of silent\r\nlife, such, perhaps, as was never heard of in the world before, I shall\r\ntake it from its beginning, and continue it in its order. It was, by\r\nmy account, the 30th of September when, in the manner as above said, I\r\nfirst set foot upon this horrid island, when the sun being to us in its\r\nautumnal equinox, was almost just over my head, for I reckoned myself,\r\nby observation, to be in the latitude of 9 degrees 22 minutes north of\r\nthe line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n_Robinson’s Mode of Reckoning Time--Difficulties Arising from Want of\r\nTools--He Arranges His Habitation_\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came into my\r\nthoughts that I should lose my reckoning of time for want of books and\r\npen and ink, and should even forget the Sabbath days from the working\r\ndays; but to prevent this, I cut it with my knife upon a large post, in\r\ncapital letters; and making it into a great cross, I set it up on the\r\nshore where I first landed, viz., “I came on shore here on the 30th of\r\nSeptember, 1659.” Upon the sides of this square post I cut every day a\r\nnotch with my knife, and every seventh notch was as long again as the\r\nrest, and every first day of the month as long again as that long one;\r\nand thus I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning\r\nof time.\r\n\r\nIn the next place we are to observe, that among the many things which\r\nI brought out of the ship in the several voyages, which, as above\r\nmentioned, I made to it, I got several things of less value, but not\r\nall less useful to me, which I omitted setting down before; as in\r\nparticular, pens, ink, and paper, several parcels in the captain’s,\r\nmate’s, gunner’s, and carpenter’s keeping, three or four compasses,\r\nsome mathematical instruments, dials, perspectives, charts, and books\r\nof navigation, all of which I huddled together, whether I might want\r\nthem or no. Also I found three very good Bibles, which came to me in\r\nmy cargo from England, and which I had packed up among my things; some\r\nPortuguese books also, and among them two or three Popish prayer-books,\r\nand several other books, all which I carefully secured. And I must not\r\nforget, that we had in the ship a dog and two cats, of whose eminent\r\nhistory I may have occasion to say something in its place; for I\r\ncarried both the cats with me; and as for the dog, he jumped out of\r\nthe ship of himself, and swam on shore to me the day after I went on\r\nshore with my first cargo, and was a trusty servant to me many years.\r\nI wanted nothing that he could fetch me, nor any company that he could\r\nmake up to me; I only wanted to have him talk to me, but that would not\r\ndo. As I observed before, I found pen, ink, and paper, and I husbanded\r\nthem to the utmost; and I shall show that while my ink lasted, I kept\r\nthings very exact; but after that was gone, I could not, for I could\r\nnot make any ink by any means that I could devise.\r\n\r\nAnd this put me in mind that I wanted many things, notwithstanding all\r\nthat I had amassed together; and of these, this of ink was one, as also\r\nspade, pick-axe, and shovel, to dig or remove the earth, needles, pins,\r\nand thread; as for linen, I soon learned to want that without much\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_--and making it into a great cross, I set it up on the\r\nshore where I first landed--_”]\r\n\r\nThis want of tools made every work I did go on heavily; and it was\r\nnear a whole year before I had entirely finished my little pale or\r\nsurrounded habitation. The piles or stakes, which were as heavy as\r\nI could well lift, were a long time in cutting and preparing in the\r\nwoods, and more by far in bringing home; so that I spent sometimes two\r\ndays in cutting and bringing home one of those posts, and a third\r\nday in driving it into the ground; for which purpose I got a heavy\r\npiece of wood at first, but at last bethought myself of one of the iron\r\ncrows, which, however, though I found it, yet it made driving those\r\nposts or piles very laborious and tedious work.\r\n\r\nBut what need I have been concerned at the tediousness of anything I\r\nhad to do, seeing I had time enough to do it in? Nor had I any other\r\nemployment, if that had been over, at least, that I could foresee,\r\nexcept the ranging the island to seek for food, which I did more or\r\nless every day.\r\n\r\nI now began to consider seriously my condition, and the circumstance I\r\nwas reduced to; and I drew up the state of my affairs in writing; not\r\nso much to leave them to any that were to come after me, for I was like\r\nto have but few heirs, as to deliver my thoughts from daily poring upon\r\nthem, and afflicting my mind. And as my reason began now to master my\r\ndespondency, I began to comfort myself as well as I could, and to set\r\nthe good against the evil, that I might have something to distinguish\r\nmy case from worse; and I stated it very impartially, like debtor and\r\ncreditor, the comforts I enjoyed against the miseries I suffered, thus:\r\n\r\n            _Evil._                             _Good._\r\n\r\n     I am cast upon a horrible            But I am alive, and not\r\n  desolate island, void of all         drowned, as all my ship’s\r\n  hope of recovery.                    company was.\r\n\r\n     I am singled out and separated,      But I am singled out, too,\r\n  as it were, from all the             from all the ship’s crew to be\r\n  world to be miserable.               spared from death; and He\r\n                                       that miraculously saved me\r\n                                       from death, can deliver me\r\n                                       from this condition.\r\n\r\n     I am divided from mankind,           But I am not starved and\r\n  a solitaire, one banished            perishing on a barren place,\r\n  from human society.                  affording no sustenance.\r\n\r\n     I have not clothes to cover          But I am in a hot climate,\r\n  me.                                  where if I had clothes I could\r\n                                       hardly wear them.\r\n\r\n     I am without any defence             But I am cast on an island,\r\n  or means to resist any violence      where I see no wild beasts to\r\n  of man or beast.                     hurt me, as I saw on the coast\r\n                                       of Africa; and what if I had\r\n                                       been shipwrecked there?\r\n\r\n     I have no soul to speak to,          But God wonderfully sent\r\n  or relieve me.                       the ship in near enough to the\r\n                                       shore, that I have gotten out\r\n                                       so many necessary things as\r\n                                       will either supply my wants,\r\n                                       or enable me to supply myself\r\n                                       even as long as I live.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony, that there was scarce\r\nany condition in the world so miserable, but there was something\r\nnegative or something positive to be thankful for in it; and let this\r\nstand as a direction from the experience of the most miserable of all\r\nconditions in this world, that we may always find in it something to\r\ncomfort ourselves from, and to set in the description of good and evil\r\non the credit side of the account.\r\n\r\nHaving now brought my mind a little to relish my condition, and given\r\nover looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a ship; I say, giving\r\nover these things, I began to apply myself to accommodate my way of\r\nliving, and to make things as easy to me as I could.\r\n\r\nI have already described my habitation, which was a tent under the\r\nside of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of posts and cables;\r\nbut I might now rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall up\r\nagainst it of turfs, about two feet thick on the outside, and after\r\nsome time--I think it was a year and a half--I raised rafters from it\r\nleading to the rock, and thatched or covered it with boughs of trees\r\nand such things as I could get to keep out the rain, which I found at\r\nsome times of the year very violent.\r\n\r\nI have already observed how I brought all my goods into this pale, and\r\ninto the cave which I had made behind me. But I must observe, too, that\r\nat first this was a confused heap of goods, which as they lay in no\r\norder, so they took up all my place; I had no room to turn myself. So\r\nI set myself to enlarge my cave and works farther into the earth; for\r\nit was a loose sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labor I bestowed\r\non it. And so, when I found I was pretty safe as to beasts of prey, I\r\nworked sideways to the right hand into the rock; and then, turning to\r\nthe right again, worked quite out, and made me a door to come out on\r\nthe outside of my pale or fortification. This gave me not only egress\r\nand regress, as it were a back-way to my tent and to my storehouse,\r\nbut gave me room to stow my goods.\r\n\r\nAnd now I began to apply myself to make such necessary things as I\r\nfound I most wanted, as particularly a chair and a table; for without\r\nthese I was not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world. I\r\ncould not write or eat, or do several things with so much pleasure\r\nwithout a table.\r\n\r\nSo I went to work; and here I must needs observe, that as reason is\r\nthe substance and original of the mathematics, so by stating and\r\nsquaring everything by reason, and by making the most rational judgment\r\nof things, every man may be in time master of every mechanic art.\r\nI had never handled a tool in my life; and yet in time, by labor,\r\napplication, and contrivance, I found at last that I wanted nothing but\r\nI could have made it, especially if I had had tools. However, I made\r\nabundance of things even without tools, and some with no more tools\r\nthan an adze and a hatchet, which, perhaps, were never made that way\r\nbefore, and that with infinite labor. For example, if I wanted a board,\r\nI had no other way but to cut down a tree, set it on an edge before me,\r\nand hew it flat on either side with my axe, till I had brought it to be\r\nthin as a plank, and then dub it smooth with my adze. It is true, by\r\nthis method I could make but one board out of a whole tree; but this I\r\nhad no remedy for but patience, any more than I had for the prodigious\r\ndeal of time and labor which it took me up to make a plank or board.\r\nBut my time or labor was little worth, and so it was as well employed\r\none way as another.\r\n\r\nHowever, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed above, in the\r\nfirst place, and this I did out of the short pieces of boards that\r\nI brought on my raft from the ship. But when I had wrought out some\r\nboards, as above, I made large shelves of the breadth of a foot and a\r\nhalf one over another, all along one side of my cave, to lay all my\r\ntools, nails, and iron-work; and, in a word, to separate everything\r\nat large in their places, that I might come easily at them. I knocked\r\npieces into the wall of the rock to hang my guns and all things that\r\nwould hang up; so that had my cave been to be seen, it looked like a\r\ngeneral magazine of all necessary things; and I had everything so ready\r\nat my hand, that it was a great pleasure to me to see all my goods in\r\nsuch order, and especially to find my stock of all necessaries so great.\r\n\r\nAnd now it was when I began to keep a journal of every day’s\r\nemployment; for, indeed, at first I was in too much hurry, and not\r\nonly hurry as to labor, but in too much discomposure of mind; and\r\nmy journal would have been full of many dull things. For example, I\r\nmust have said thus: _Sept, the 30th_.--After I got to shore, and had\r\nescaped drowning, instead of being thankful to God for my deliverance,\r\nhaving first vomited with the great quantity of salt water which was\r\ngotten into my stomach, and recovering myself a little, I ran about the\r\nshore, wringing my hands, and beating my head and face, exclaiming at\r\nmy misery, and crying out, I was undone, undone, till, tired and faint,\r\nI was forced to lie down on the ground to repose; but durst not sleep,\r\nfor fear of being devoured.\r\n\r\nSome days after this, and after I had been on board the ship, and got\r\nall that I could out of her, yet I could not forbear getting up to the\r\ntop of a little mountain, and looking out to sea, in hopes of seeing a\r\nship; then fancy at a vast distance I spied a sail, please myself with\r\nthe hopes of it, and then, after looking steadily till I was almost\r\nblind, lose it quite, and sit down and weep like a child, and thus\r\nincrease my misery by my folly.\r\n\r\nBut having gotten over these things in some measure, and having settled\r\nmy household stuff and habitation, made me a table and a chair, and all\r\nas handsome about me as I could, I began to keep my journal, of which\r\nI shall here give you the copy (though in it will be told all these\r\nparticulars over again) as long as it lasted; for, having no more ink,\r\nI was forced to leave it off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n_Robinson’s Journal--Details of His Domestic Economy and\r\nContrivances--Shock of an Earthquake_\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 30, 1659._--I, poor miserable Robinson Crusoe, being\r\nshipwrecked, during a dreadful storm, in the offing, came on shore on\r\nthis dismal unfortunate island, which I called the Island of Despair,\r\nall the rest of the ship’s company being drowned, and myself almost\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nAll the rest of that day I spent in afflicting myself at the dismal\r\ncircumstances I was brought to, viz., I had neither food, house,\r\nclothes, weapon, nor place to fly to; and in despair of any relief, saw\r\nnothing but death before me; either that I should be devoured by wild\r\nbeasts, murdered by savages, or starved to death for want of food. At\r\nthe approach of night, I slept in a tree for fear of wild creatures,\r\nbut slept soundly, though it rained all night.\r\n\r\n_Oct. 1._--In the morning I saw, to my great surprise, the ship had\r\nfloated with the high tide, and was driven on shore again much nearer\r\nthe island; which, as it was some comfort on one hand, for seeing her\r\nsit upright, and not broken to pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I\r\nmight get on board, and get some food and necessaries out of her for\r\nmy relief; so, on the other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss of\r\nmy comrades, who, I imagined, if we had all stayed on board, might\r\nhave saved the ship, or at least that they would not have been all\r\ndrowned as they were; and that had the men been saved, we might perhaps\r\nhave built us a boat out of the ruins of the ship, to have carried us\r\nto some other part of the world. I spent great part of this day in\r\nperplexing myself on these things; but at length seeing the ship almost\r\ndry, I went upon the sand as near as I could, and then swam on board;\r\nthis day also it continued raining, though with no wind at all.\r\n\r\nFrom the 1st of _October_ to the 24th.--All these days entirely spent\r\nin many several voyages to get all I could out of the ship, which I\r\nbrought on shore, every tide of flood, upon rafts. Much rain also in\r\nthese days, though with some intervals of fair weather; but, it seems,\r\nthis was the rainy season.\r\n\r\n_Oct. 20._--I overset my raft, and all the goods I had got upon it; but\r\nbeing in shoal water, and the things being chiefly heavy, I recovered\r\nmany of them when the tide was out.\r\n\r\n_Oct. 25._--It rained all night and all day, with some gusts of wind,\r\nduring which time the ship broke in pieces, the wind blowing a little\r\nharder than before, and was no more to be seen, except the wreck of\r\nher, and that only at low water. I spent this day in covering and\r\nsecuring the goods which I had saved, that the rain might not spoil\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_Oct. 26._--I walked about the shore almost all day to find out a\r\nplace to fix my habitation, greatly concerned to secure myself from\r\nan attack in the night, either from wild beasts or men. Towards night\r\nI fixed upon a proper place under a rock, and marked out a semicircle\r\nfor my encampment, which I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall,\r\nor fortification made of double piles, lined within with cables, and\r\nwithout with turf.\r\n\r\nFrom the 26th to the 30th I worked very hard in carrying all my goods\r\nto my new habitation, though some part of the time it rained exceeding\r\nhard.\r\n\r\nThe 31st, in the morning, I went out into the island with my gun to\r\nseek for some food, and discover the country; when I killed a she-goat,\r\nand her kid followed me home, which I afterwards killed also, because\r\nit would not feed.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 1._--I set up my tent under a rock, and lay there the first\r\nnight, making it as large as I could, with stakes driven in to swing my\r\nhammock upon.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 2._--I set up all my chests and boards, and the pieces of timber\r\nwhich made my rafts, and with them formed a fence round me, a little\r\nwithin the place I had marked out for my fortification.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 3._--I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls like ducks,\r\nwhich were very good food. In the afternoon went to work to make me a\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 4._--This morning I began to order my times of work, of going\r\nout with my gun, time of sleep, and time of diversion, viz., every\r\nmorning I walked out with my gun for two or three hours, if it did not\r\nrain; then employed myself to work till about eleven o’clock; then eat\r\nwhat I had to live on; and from twelve to two I lay down to sleep, the\r\nweather being excessive hot; and then in the evening to work again. The\r\nworking part of this day and of the next were wholly employed in making\r\nmy table; for I was yet but a very sorry workman, though time and\r\nnecessity made me a complete natural mechanic soon after, as I believe\r\nit would do any one else.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 5._--This day went abroad with my gun and my dog, and killed a\r\nwild cat; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good for nothing. Every\r\ncreature I killed, I took off the skins and preserved them. Coming\r\nback by the sea-shore, I saw many sorts of sea-fowls, which I did not\r\nunderstand; but was surprised, and almost frightened, with two or three\r\nseals, which, while I was gazing at, not well knowing what they were,\r\ngot into the sea, and escaped me for that time.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 6._--After my morning walk I went to work with my table again,\r\nand finished it, though not to my liking; nor was it long before I\r\nlearned to mend it.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 7._--Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 7th, 8th, 9th,\r\n10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was Sunday) I took wholly up\r\nto make me a chair, and with much ado, brought it to a tolerable shape,\r\nbut never to please me; and even in the making, I pulled it in pieces\r\nseveral times. Note, I soon neglected my keeping Sundays; for, omitting\r\nmy mark for them on my post, I forgot which was which.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 13._--This day it rained, which refreshed me exceedingly, and\r\ncooled the earth; but it was accompanied with terrible thunder and\r\nlightning, which frightened me dreadfully, for fear of my powder. As\r\nsoon as it was over, I resolved to separate my stock of powder into as\r\nmany little parcels as possible, that it might not be in danger.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 14, 15, 16._--These three days I spent in making little square\r\nchests or boxes, which might hold about a pound, or two pound at most,\r\nof powder; and so putting the powder in, I stowed it in places as\r\nsecure and remote from one another as possible. On one of these three\r\ndays I killed a large bird that was good to eat, but I know not what to\r\ncall it.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 17._--This day I began to dig behind my tent into the rock,\r\nto make room for my farther convenience. Note, three things I\r\nwanted exceedingly for this work, viz., a pick-axe, a shovel, and\r\na wheelbarrow or basket; so I desisted from my work, and began to\r\nconsider how to supply that want, and make me some tools. As for a\r\npick-axe, I made use of the iron crows, which were proper enough,\r\nthough heavy; but the next thing was a shovel or spade. This was so\r\nabsolutely necessary, that indeed I could do nothing effectually\r\nwithout it; but what kind of one to make, I knew not.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 18._--The next day, in searching the woods, I found a tree\r\nof that wood, or like it, which in the Brazils they call the iron\r\ntree, for its exceeding hardness; of this, with great labor, and\r\nalmost spoiling my axe, I cut a piece, and brought it home, too, with\r\ndifficulty enough, for it was exceeding heavy.\r\n\r\nThe excessive hardness of the wood, and having no other way, made me a\r\nlong while upon this machine, for I worked it effectually, by little\r\nand little, into the form of a shovel or spade, the handle exactly\r\nshaped like ours in England, only that the broad part having no iron\r\nshod upon it at bottom, it would not last me so long. However, it\r\nserved well enough for the uses which I had occasion to put it to; but\r\nnever was a shovel, I believe, made after that fashion, or so long\r\na-making.\r\n\r\nI was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a wheelbarrow. A\r\nbasket I could not make by any means, having no such things at twigs\r\nthat would bend to make wicker-ware, at least none yet found out. And\r\nas to a wheelbarrow, I fancied I could make all but the wheel, but that\r\nI had no notion of, neither did I know how to go about it; besides, I\r\nhad no possible way to make the iron gudgeons for the spindle or axis\r\nof the wheel to run in, so I gave it over; and so for carrying away the\r\nearth which I dug out of the cave, I made me a thing like a hod which\r\nthe laborers carry mortar in, when they serve the bricklayers.\r\n\r\nThis was not so difficult to me as the making the shovel; and yet\r\nthis, and the shovel, and the attempt which I made in vain to make\r\na wheelbarrow, took me up no less than four days; I mean always,\r\nexcepting my morning walk with my gun, which I seldom failed, and very\r\nseldom failed also bringing home something fit to eat.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 23._--My other work having now stood still because of my making\r\nthese tools, when they were finished I went on, and working every\r\nday, as my strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days entirely\r\nin widening and deepening my cave, that it might hold my goods\r\ncommodiously.\r\n\r\n_Note._--During all this time I worked to make this room or cave\r\nspacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse or magazine, a\r\nkitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar; as for my lodging, I kept to the\r\ntent, except that sometimes in the wet season of the year it rained\r\nso hard, that I could not keep myself dry, which caused me afterwards\r\nto cover all my place within my pale with long poles, in the form of\r\nrafters, leaning against the rock, and load them with flags and large\r\nleaves of trees, like a thatch.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 10._--I began now to think my cave or vault finished, when on a\r\nsudden (it seems I had made it too large) a great quantity of earth\r\nfell down from the top and one side, so much, that, in short, it\r\nfrightened me, and not without reason too; for if I had been under it,\r\nI had never wanted a grave-digger. Upon this disaster I had a great\r\ndeal of work to do over again; for I had the loose earth to carry out;\r\nand, which was of more importance, I had the ceiling to prop up, so\r\nthat I might be sure no more would come down.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 11._--This day I went to work with it accordingly, and got two\r\nshores or posts pitched upright to the top, with two pieces of boards\r\nacross over each post. This I finished the next day; and setting more\r\nposts up with boards, in about a week more I had the roof secure; and\r\nthe posts standing in rows, served me for partitions to part of my\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 17._--From this day to the twentieth I placed shelves, and\r\nknocked up nails on the posts to hang everything up that could be hung\r\nup; and now I began to be in some order within doors.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 20._--Now I carried everything into the cave, and began to\r\nfurnish my house, and set up some pieces of boards, like a dresser, to\r\norder my victuals upon; but boards began to be very scarce with me;\r\nalso I made me another table.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 24._--Much rain all night and all day; no stirring out.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 25._--Rain all day.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 26._--No rain, and the earth much cooler than before, and\r\npleasanter.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 27._--Killed a young goat, and lamed another, so that I caught\r\nit, and led it home on a string. When I had it home, I bound and\r\nsplintered up its leg, which was broke. _N.B._--I took such care of it,\r\nthat it lived; and the leg grew well and as strong as ever; but by my\r\nnursing it so long it grew tame, and fed upon the little green at my\r\ndoor, and would not go away. This was the first time that I entertained\r\na thought of breeding up some tame creatures, that I might have food\r\nwhen my powder and shot was all spent.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 28, 29, 30._--Great heats and no breeze, so that there was no\r\nstirring abroad, except in the evening, for food. This time I spent in\r\nputting all my things in order within doors.\r\n\r\n_Jan. 1._--Very hot still, but I went abroad early and late with my\r\ngun, and lay still in the middle of the day. This evening, going\r\nfarther into the valleys which lay towards the centre of the island, I\r\nfound there was plenty of goats, though exceeding shy, and hard to come\r\nat. However I resolved to try if I could not bring my dog to hunt them\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n_Jan. 2._--Accordingly, the next day, I went out with my dog, and set\r\nhim upon the goats; but I was mistaken, for they all faced about upon\r\nthe dog; and he knew his danger too well, for he would not come near\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_Jan. 8._--I began my fence or wall; which, being still jealous of my\r\nbeing attacked by somebody, I resolved to make very thick and strong.\r\n\r\n_N.B._--This wall being described before, I purposely omit what\r\nwas said in the journal. It is sufficient to observe that I was no\r\nless time than from the 3rd of January to the 14th of April working,\r\nfinishing, and perfecting this wall, though it was no more than about\r\ntwenty-four yards in length, being a half circle from one place in the\r\nrock to another place about eight yards from it, the door of the cave\r\nbeing in the centre behind it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering me many days,\r\nnay, sometimes weeks together; but I thought I should never be\r\nperfectly secure till this wall was finished. And it is scarce credible\r\nwhat inexpressible labor everything was done with, especially the\r\nbringing piles out of the woods, and driving them into the ground; for\r\nI made them much bigger than I need to have done.\r\n\r\nWhen this wall was finished, and the outside double-fenced with a\r\nturf-wall raised up close to it, I persuaded myself that if any people\r\nwere to come on shore there, they would not perceive anything like a\r\nhabitation; and it was very well I did so, as may be observed hereafter\r\nupon a very remarkable occasion.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, I made my rounds in the woods for game every day,\r\nwhen the rain admitted me, and made frequent discoveries in these walks\r\nof something or other to my advantage; particularly I found a kind of\r\nwild pigeons, who built, not as wood pigeons, in a tree, but rather as\r\nhouse pigeons, in the holes of the rocks. And taking some young ones, I\r\nendeavored to breed them up tame, and did so; but when they grew older\r\nthey flew all away, which, perhaps, was at first for want of feeding\r\nthem, for I had nothing to give them. However, I frequently found their\r\nnests, and got their young ones, which were very good meat.\r\n\r\nAnd now in the managing my household affairs I found myself wanting in\r\nmany things, which I thought at first it was impossible for me to make,\r\nas indeed, as to some of them, it was. For instance, I could never make\r\na cask to be hooped; I had a small runlet or two, as I observed before,\r\nbut I could never arrive to the capacity of making one by them, though\r\nI spent many weeks about it. I could neither put in the heads, or joint\r\nthe staves so true to one another, as to make them hold water; so I\r\ngave that also over.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, I was at a great loss for candles; so that as soon\r\nas ever it was dark, which was generally by seven o’clock, I was\r\nobliged to go to bed. I remembered the lump of beeswax with which I\r\nmade candles in my African adventure, but I had none of that now.\r\nThe only remedy I had was, that when I had killed a goat I saved the\r\ntallow, and with a little dish made of clay, which I baked in the sun,\r\nto which I added a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp; and this gave\r\nme light, though not a clear steady light like a candle.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of all my labors it happened, that rummaging my things,\r\nI found a little bag, which, as I hinted before, had been filled with\r\ncorn for the feeding of poultry, not for this voyage, but before, as I\r\nsuppose, when the ship came from Lisbon. What little remainder of corn\r\nhad been in the bag was all devoured with the rats, and I saw nothing\r\nin the bag but husks and dust; and being willing to have the bag for\r\nsome other use, I think it was to put powder in, when I divided it for\r\nfear of the lightning, or some such use, I shook the husks of corn out\r\nof it on one side of my fortification, under the rock. It was a little\r\nbefore the great rains, just now mentioned, that I threw this stuff\r\naway, taking no notice of anything, and not so much as remembering\r\nthat I had thrown anything there; when, about a month after, or\r\nthereabout, I saw some few stalks of something green shooting out of\r\nthe ground, which I fancied might be some plant I had not seen; but I\r\nwas surprised, and perfectly astonished, when, after a little longer\r\ntime, I saw about ten or twelve ears come out, which were perfect green\r\nbarley of the same kind as our European, nay, as our English barley.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion of my\r\nthoughts on this occasion. I had hitherto acted upon no religious\r\nfoundation at all; indeed, I had very few notions of religion in my\r\nhead, or had entertained any sense of anything that had befallen me\r\notherwise than as a chance, or, as we lightly say, what pleases God;\r\nwithout so much as inquiring into the end of Providence in these\r\nthings, or His order in governing events in the world. But after I\r\nsaw barley grow there, in a climate which I know was not proper for\r\ncorn, and especially that I knew not how it came there, it startled\r\nme strangely, and I began to suggest that God had miraculously caused\r\nthis grain to grow without any help of seed sown, and that it was so\r\ndirected purely for my sustenance on that wild miserable place.\r\n\r\nThis touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of my eyes; and\r\nI began to bless myself, that such a prodigy of Nature should happen\r\nupon my account; and this was the more strange to me, because I saw\r\nnear it still, all along by the side of the rock, some other straggling\r\nstalks, which proved to be stalks of rice, and which I knew, because I\r\nhad seen it grow in Africa, when I was ashore there.\r\n\r\nI not only thought these the pure productions of Providence for my\r\nsupport, but, not doubting but that there was more in the place, I\r\nwent all over that part of the island where I had been before, peering\r\nin every corner, and under every rock, to see for more of it; but I\r\ncould not find any. At last it occurred to my thoughts that I had\r\nshook a bag of chickens’ meat out in that place, and then the wonder\r\nbegan to cease; and I must confess, my religious thankfulness to God’s\r\nprovidence began to abate too, upon the discovering that all this was\r\nnothing but what was common; though I ought to have been as thankful\r\nfor so strange and unforeseen Providence, as if it had been miraculous;\r\nfor it was really the work of Providence as to me, that should order or\r\nappoint, that ten or twelve grains of corn should remain unsoiled (when\r\nthe rats had destroyed all the rest), as if it had been dropped from\r\nheaven; as also that I should throw it out in that particular place,\r\nwhere, it being in the shade of a high rock, it sprang out immediately;\r\nwhereas, if I had thrown it anywhere else at that time, it had been\r\nburnt up and destroyed.\r\n\r\nI carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in their\r\nseason, which was about the end of June; and laying up every corn, I\r\nresolved to sow them all again, hoping in time to have some quantity\r\nsufficient to supply me with bread. But it was not till the fourth year\r\nthat I could allow myself the least grain of this corn to eat, and even\r\nthen but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards in its order; for I lost\r\nall that I sowed the first season, by not observing the proper time;\r\nfor I sowed it just before the dry season, so that it never came up at\r\nall, at least not as it would have done; of which in its place.\r\n\r\nBesides this barley, there was, as above, twenty or thirty stalks of\r\nrice, which I preserved with the same care, and whose use was of the\r\nsame kind, or to the same purpose, viz., to make me bread, or rather\r\nfood; for I found ways to cook it up without baking, though I did that\r\nalso after some time. But to return to my journal.\r\n\r\nI worked excessive hard these three or four months to get my wall done;\r\nand on the 14th of April I closed it up, contriving to go into it, not\r\nby a door, but over the wall by a ladder, that there might be no sign\r\nin the outside of my habitation.\r\n\r\n_April 16._--I finished the ladder, so I went up with the ladder to the\r\ntop, and then pulled it up after me, and let it down on the inside.\r\nThis was a complete enclosure to me; for within I had room enough, and\r\nnothing could come at me from without, unless it could first mount my\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nThe very next day after this wall was finished, I had almost had all\r\nmy labor overthrown at once, and myself killed. The case was thus: As\r\nI was busy in the inside of it, behind my tent, just in the entrance\r\ninto my cave, I was terribly frightened with a most dreadful surprising\r\nthing indeed; for all on a sudden I found the earth come crumbling\r\ndown from the roof of my cave, and from the edge of the hill over\r\nmy head, and two of the posts I had set up in the cave cracked in a\r\nfrightful manner. I was heartily scared, but thought nothing of what\r\nwas really the cause, only thinking that the top of my cave was falling\r\nin, as some of it had done before; and for fear I should be buried in\r\nit, I ran forward to my ladder; and not thinking myself safe there\r\nneither, I got over my wall for fear of the pieces of the hill which I\r\nexpected might roll down upon me. I was no sooner stepped down upon the\r\nfirm ground, but I plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake; for the\r\nground I stood on shook three times at about eight minutes’ distance,\r\nwith three such shocks, as would have overturned the strongest building\r\nthat could be supposed to have stood on the earth; and a great piece of\r\nthe top of a rock, which stood about half a mile from me next the sea,\r\nfell down with such a terrible noise, as I never heard in all my life.\r\nI perceived also the very sea was put into violent motion by it; and I\r\nbelieve the shocks were stronger under the water than on the island.\r\n\r\nI was so amazed with the thing itself, having never felt the like,\r\nor discoursed with any one that had, that I was like one dead or\r\nstupefied; and the motion of the earth made my stomach sick, like one\r\nthat was tossed at sea. But the noise of the falling of the rock awaked\r\nme, as it were, and rousing me from the stupefied condition I was in,\r\nfilled me with horror, and I thought of nothing then but the hill\r\nfalling upon my tent and all my household goods, and burying all at\r\nonce; and this sunk my very soul within me a second time.\r\n\r\nAfter the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some time, I\r\nbegan to take courage; and yet I had not heart enough to go over my\r\nwall again, for fear of being buried alive, but sat still upon the\r\nground, greatly cast down and disconsolate, not knowing what to do. All\r\nthis while I had not the least serious religious thought, nothing but\r\nthe common, “Lord, have mercy upon me!” and when it was over, that went\r\naway too.\r\n\r\nWhile I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow cloudy, as if it\r\nwould rain. Soon after that the wind rose by little and little, so that\r\nin less than half an hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane. The sea\r\nwas all on a sudden covered over with foam and froth; the shore was\r\ncovered with the breach of the water; the trees were torn up by the\r\nroots; and a terrible storm it was; and this held about three hours,\r\nand then began to abate; and in two hours more it was stark calm, and\r\nbegan to rain very hard.\r\n\r\nAll this while I sat upon the ground, very much terrified and dejected;\r\nwhen on a sudden it came into my thoughts, that these winds and rain\r\nbeing the consequences of the earthquake, the earthquake itself was\r\nspent and over, and I might venture into my cave again. With this\r\nthought my spirits began to revive; and the rain also helping to\r\npersuade me, I went in and sat down in my tent. But the rain was so\r\nviolent, that my tent was ready to be beaten down with it, and I was\r\nforced to go into my cave, though very much afraid and uneasy, for\r\nfear it should fall on my head.\r\n\r\nThis violent rain forced me to a new work, viz., to cut a hole through\r\nmy new fortification, like a sink to let the water go out, which would\r\nelse have drowned my cave. After I had been in my cave some time, and\r\nfound still no more shocks of the earthquake follow, I began to be more\r\ncomposed. And now to support my spirits, which indeed wanted it very\r\nmuch, I went to my little store, and took a small sup of rum, which,\r\nhowever, I did then, and always very sparingly, knowing I could have no\r\nmore when that was gone.\r\n\r\nIt continued raining all that night and great part of the next day,\r\nso that I could not stir abroad; but my mind being more composed, I\r\nbegan to think of what I had best do, concluding that if the island\r\nwas subject to these earthquakes, there would be no living for me in\r\na cave, but I must consider of building me some little hut in an open\r\nplace, which I might surround with a wall, as I had done here, and so\r\nmake myself secure from wild beasts or men; but concluded, if I stayed\r\nwhere I was, I should certainly, one time or other, be buried alive.\r\n\r\nWith these thoughts I resolved to remove my tent from the place where\r\nit stood, which was just under the hanging precipice of the hill, and\r\nwhich, if it should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon my tent;\r\nand I spent the two next days, being the 19th and 20th of April, in\r\ncontriving where and how to remove my habitation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_All this while I sat upon the ground, very much\r\nterrified and dejected_”]\r\n\r\nThe fear of being swallowed up alive made me that I never slept\r\nin quiet; and yet the apprehension of lying abroad without any fence\r\nwas almost equal to it. But still, when I looked about and saw how\r\neverything was put in order, how pleasantly concealed I was, and how\r\nsafe from danger, it made me very loth to remove.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime it occurred to me that it would require a vast deal of\r\ntime for me to do this, and that I must be contented to run the venture\r\nwhere I was, till I had formed a camp for myself, and had secured it\r\nso as to remove to it. So with this resolution I composed myself for a\r\ntime, and resolved that I would go to work with all speed to build me a\r\nwall with piles and cable, etc., in a circle as before, and set my tent\r\nup in it when it was finished, but that I would venture to stay where I\r\nwas till it was finished, and fit to remove to. This was the 21st.\r\n\r\n_April 22._--The next morning I began to consider of means to put\r\nthis resolve in execution; but I was at a great loss about my tools.\r\nI had three large axes, and abundance of hatchets (for we carried the\r\nhatchets for traffic with the Indians), but with much chopping and\r\ncutting knotty hard wood, they were all full of notches and dull; and\r\nthough I had a grindstone, I could not turn it and grind my tools too.\r\nThis cost me as much thought as a statesman would have bestowed upon a\r\ngrand point of politics, or a judge upon the life and death of a man.\r\nAt length I contrived a wheel with a string, to turn it with my foot,\r\nthat I might have both my hands at liberty. Note, I had never seen any\r\nsuch thing in England, or at least not to take notice how it was done,\r\nthough since I have observed it is very common there; besides that, my\r\ngrindstone was very large and heavy. This machine cost me a full week’s\r\nwork to bring it to perfection.\r\n\r\n_April 28, 29._--These two whole days I took up in grinding my tools,\r\nmy machine for turning my grindstone performing very well.\r\n\r\n_April 30._--Having perceived my bread had been low a great while, now\r\nI took a survey of it, and reduced myself to one biscuit-cake a day,\r\nwhich made my heart very heavy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n_Robinson Obtains More Articles from the Wreck--His Illness and\r\nAffliction_\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 1._--In the morning, looking towards the seaside, the tide being\r\nlow, I saw something lie on the shore bigger than ordinary, and it\r\nlooked like a cask. When I came to it, I found a small barrel, and two\r\nor three pieces of the wreck of the ship, which were driven on shore by\r\nthe late hurricane; and looking towards the wreck itself, I thought it\r\nseemed to lie higher out of the water than it used to do. I examined\r\nthe barrel which was driven on shore, and soon found it was a barrel of\r\ngunpowder; but it had taken water, and the powder was caked as hard as\r\nstone. However, I rolled it farther on shore for the present, and went\r\non upon the sands as near as I could to the wreck of the ship to look\r\nfor more.\r\n\r\nWhen I came down to the ship I found it strangely removed. The\r\nforecastle, which lay before buried in sand, was heaved up at least six\r\nfeet; and the stern, which was broken to pieces, and parted from the\r\nrest by the force of the sea soon after I had left rummaging her, was\r\ntossed, as it were, up, and cast on one side, and the sand was thrown\r\nso high on that side next her stern, that whereas there was a great\r\nplace of water before, so that I could not come within a quarter of a\r\nmile of the wreck without swimming, I could now walk quite up to her\r\nwhen the tide was out. I was surprised with this at first, but soon\r\nconcluded it must be done by the earthquake. And as by this violence\r\nthe ship was more broken open than formerly, so many things came daily\r\non shore, which the sea had loosened, and which the winds and water\r\nrolled by degrees to the land.\r\n\r\nThis wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of removing my\r\nhabitation; and I busied myself mightily, that day especially, in\r\nsearching whether I could make any way into the ship. But I found\r\nnothing was to be expected of that kind, for that all the inside of the\r\nship was choked up with sand. However, as I had learned not to despair\r\nof anything, I resolved to pull everything to pieces that I could of\r\nthe ship, concluding, that everything I could get from her would be of\r\nsome use or other to me.\r\n\r\n_May 3._--I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a beam through, which\r\nI thought held some of the upper part or quarter-deck together; and\r\nwhen I had cut it through, I cleared away the sand as well as I could\r\nfrom the side which lay highest; but the tide coming in, I was obliged\r\nto give over for that time.\r\n\r\n_May 4._--I went a-fishing, but caught not one fish that I durst eat\r\nof, till I was weary of my sport; when, just going to leave off, I\r\ncaught a young dolphin. I had made me a long line of some rope-yarn,\r\nbut I had no hooks; yet I frequently caught fish enough, as much as I\r\ncared to eat; all which I dried in the sun, and eat them dry.\r\n\r\n_May 5._--Worked on the wreck, cut another beam asunder, and brought\r\nthree great fir-planks off from the decks, which I tied together, and\r\nmade swim on shore, when the tide flood came on.\r\n\r\n_May 6._--Worked on the wreck, got several iron bolts out of her, and\r\nother pieces of ironwork; worked very hard, and came home very much\r\ntired, and had thoughts of giving it over.\r\n\r\n_May 7._--Went to the wreck again, but with an intent not to work, but\r\nfound the weight of the wreck had broke itself down, the beams being\r\ncut; that several pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose, and the\r\ninside of the hold lay so open, that I could see into it, but almost\r\nfull of water and sand.\r\n\r\n_May 8._--Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow to wrench up the\r\ndeck, which lay now quite clear of the water and sand. I wrenched open\r\ntwo planks, and brought them on shore also with the tide. I left the\r\niron crow in the wreck for the next day.\r\n\r\n_May 9._--Went to the wreck, and with the crow made way into the body\r\nof the wreck, and felt several casks, and loosened them with the crow,\r\nbut could not break them up. I felt also the roll of English lead, and\r\ncould stir it, but it was too heavy to remove.\r\n\r\n_May 10, 11, 12, 13, 14._--Went every day to the wreck, and got a\r\ngreat deal of pieces of timber, and boards, or plank, and two or three\r\nhundredweight of iron.\r\n\r\n_May 15._--I carried two hatchets to try if I could not cut a piece off\r\nof the roll of lead, by placing the edge of one hatchet, and driving it\r\nwith the other; but as it lay about a foot and a half in the water, I\r\ncould not make any blow to drive the hatchet.\r\n\r\n_May 16._--It had blowed hard in the night, and the wreck appeared more\r\nbroken by the force of the water; but I stayed so long in the woods to\r\nget pigeons for food, that the tide prevented me going to the wreck\r\nthat day.\r\n\r\n_May 17._--I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore, at a great\r\ndistance, near two miles off me, but resolved to see what they were,\r\nand found it was a piece of the head, but too heavy for me to bring\r\naway.\r\n\r\n_May 24._--Every day to this day I worked on the wreck, and with hard\r\nlabor I loosened some things so much with the crow, that the first\r\nblowing tide several casks floated out, and two of the seamen’s chests.\r\nBut the wind blowing from the shore, nothing came to land that day but\r\npieces of timber, and a hogshead, which had some Brazil pork in it, but\r\nthe salt water and the sand had spoiled it.\r\n\r\nI continued this work every day to the 15th of June, except the time\r\nnecessary to get food, which I always appointed, during this part of\r\nmy employment, to be when the tide was up, that I might be ready when\r\nit was ebbed out. And by this time I had gotten timber, and plank,\r\nand ironwork enough to have builded a good boat, if I had known how;\r\nand also, I got at several times, and in several pieces, near one\r\nhundredweight of the sheet lead.\r\n\r\n_June 16._--Going down to the seaside, I found a large tortoise,\r\nor turtle. This was the first I had seen, which it seems was only\r\nmy misfortune, not any defect of the place, or scarcity; for had\r\nI happened to be on the other side of the island, I might have had\r\nhundreds of them every day, as I found afterwards; but, perhaps, had\r\npaid dear enough for them.\r\n\r\n_June 17_--I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in her threescore\r\neggs; and her flesh was to me, at that time, the most savory and\r\npleasant that ever I tasted in my life, having had no flesh, but of\r\ngoats and fowls, since I landed in this horrid place.\r\n\r\n_June 18._--Rained all day, and I stayed within. I thought at this time\r\nthe rain felt cold, and I was something chilly, which I knew was not\r\nusual in that latitude.\r\n\r\n_June 19._--Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather had been cold.\r\n\r\n_June 20._--No rest all night; violent pains in my head, and feverish.\r\n\r\n_June 21._--Very ill, frightened almost to death with the apprehensions\r\nof my sad condition, to be sick, and no help. Prayed to God for the\r\nfirst time since the storm off of Hull, but scarce knew what I said, or\r\nwhy; my thoughts being all confused.\r\n\r\n_June 22._--A little better, but under dreadful apprehensions of\r\nsickness.\r\n\r\n_June 23._--Very bad again; cold and shivering, and then a violent\r\nheadache.\r\n\r\n_June 24._--Much better.\r\n\r\n_June 25._--An ague very violent; the fit held me seven hours; cold\r\nfit, and hot, with faint sweats after it.\r\n\r\n_June 26._--Better; and having no victuals to eat, took my gun, but\r\nfound myself very weak. However, I killed a she-goat, and with much\r\ndifficulty got it home, and broiled some of it, and ate. I would fain\r\nhave stewed it and made some broth, but had no pot.\r\n\r\n_June 27._--The ague again so violent that I lay abed all day, and\r\nneither ate nor drank. I was ready to perish for thirst; but so weak,\r\nI had not strength to stand up, or to get myself any water to drink.\r\nPrayed to God again, but was light-headed; and when I was not, I was\r\nso ignorant that I knew not what to say; only I lay and cried, “Lord,\r\nlook upon me! Lord, pity me! Lord, have mercy upon me!” I suppose I did\r\nnothing else for two or three hours, till the fit wearing off, I fell\r\nasleep, and did not wake till far in the night. When I waked, I found\r\nmyself much refreshed, but weak, and exceeding thirsty. However, as I\r\nhad no water in my whole habitation, I was forced to lie till morning,\r\nand went to sleep again. In this second sleep I had this terrible dream.\r\n\r\nI thought that I was sitting on the ground, on the outside of my wall,\r\nwhere I sat when the storm blew after the earthquake, and that I saw\r\na man descend from a great black cloud, in a bright flame of fire,\r\nand light upon the ground. He was all over as bright as a flame, so\r\nthat I could but just bear to look towards him. His countenance was\r\nmost inexpressibly dreadful, impossible for words to describe. When he\r\nstepped upon the ground with his feet, I thought the earth trembled,\r\njust as it had done before in the earthquake, and all the air looked,\r\nto my apprehension, as if it had been filled with flashes of fire.\r\n\r\nHe was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he moved forward towards\r\nme, with a long spear or weapon in his hand, to kill me; and when he\r\ncame to a rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to me, or I heard a\r\nvoice so terrible, that it is impossible to express the terror of it.\r\nAll that I can say I understood was this: “Seeing all these things have\r\nnot brought thee to repentance, now thou shalt die;” at which words I\r\nthought he lifted up the spear that was in his hand to kill me.\r\n\r\nNo one that shall ever read this account, will expect that I should\r\nbe able to describe the horrors of my soul at this terrible vision; I\r\nmean, that even while it was a dream, I even dreamed of these horrors;\r\nnor is it any more possible to describe the impression that remained\r\nupon my mind when I awaked, and found it was but a dream.\r\n\r\nI had, alas! no divine knowledge; what I had received by the good\r\ninstruction of my father was then worn out, by an uninterrupted series,\r\nfor eight years, of seafaring wickedness, and a constant conversation\r\nwith nothing but such as were, like myself, wicked and profane to\r\nthe last degree. I do not remember that I had, in all that time, one\r\nthought that so much as tended either to looking upwards toward God,\r\nor inwards toward a reflection upon my ways; but a certain stupidity\r\nof soul, without desire of good, or conscience of evil, had entirely\r\noverwhelmed me; and I was all that the most hardened, unthinking,\r\nwicked creature among our common sailors can be supposed to be; not\r\nhaving the least sense, either of the fear of God in danger, or of\r\nthankfulness to God in deliverances.\r\n\r\nIn the relating what is already past of my story, this will be the more\r\neasily believed, when I shall add, that through all the variety of\r\nmiseries that had to this day befallen me, I never had so much as one\r\nthought of it being the hand of God, or that it was a just punishment\r\nfor my sin; my rebellious behavior against my father, or my present\r\nsins, which were great; or so much as a punishment for the general\r\ncourse of my wicked life. When I was on the desperate expedition on the\r\ndesert shores of Africa, I never had so much as one thought of what\r\nwould become of me; or one wish to God to direct me whither I should\r\ngo; or to keep me from the dangers which apparently surrounded me,\r\nas well from voracious creatures as cruel savages. But I was merely\r\nthoughtless of a God or a Providence; acted like a mere brute from the\r\nprinciples of Nature, and by the dictates of common sense only, and\r\nindeed hardly that.\r\n\r\nWhen I was delivered and taken up at sea by the Portuguese captain,\r\nwell used, and dealt justly and honorably with, as well as charitably,\r\nI had not the least thankfulness in my thoughts. When again I was\r\nshipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of drowning on this island, I was as\r\nfar from remorse, or looking on it as a judgment; I only said to myself\r\noften, that I was an unfortunate dog, and born to be always miserable.\r\n\r\nIt is true, when I got on shore first here, and found all my ship’s\r\ncrew drowned, and myself spared, I was surprised with a kind of\r\necstasy, and some transports of soul, which, had the grace of God\r\nassisted, might have come up to true thankfulness; but it ended where\r\nit begun, in a mere common flight of joy, or, as I may say, being\r\nglad I was alive, without the least reflection upon the distinguishing\r\ngoodness of the hand which had preserved me, and had singled me out\r\nto be preserved, when all the rest were destroyed; or an inquiry why\r\nProvidence had been thus merciful to me; even just the same common sort\r\nof joy which seamen generally have after they are got safe ashore from\r\na shipwreck, which they drown all in the next bowl of punch, and forget\r\nalmost as soon as it is over, and all the rest of my life was like it.\r\n\r\nEven when I was afterwards, on due consideration, made sensible of my\r\ncondition, how I was cast on this dreadful place, out of the reach of\r\nhuman kind, out of all hope of relief, or prospect of redemption, as\r\nsoon as I saw but a prospect of living, and that I should not starve\r\nand perish for hunger, all the sense of my affliction wore off, and\r\nI began to be very easy, applied myself to the works proper for my\r\npreservation and supply, and was far enough from being afflicted, at my\r\ncondition, as a judgment from heaven, or, as the hand of God against\r\nme; these were thoughts which very seldom entered into my head.\r\n\r\nThe growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my journal, had at first\r\nsome little influence upon me, and began to affect me with seriousness,\r\nas long as I thought it had something miraculous in it; but as soon as\r\never that part of the thought was removed, all the impression which was\r\nraised from it wore off also, as I have noted already.\r\n\r\nEven the earthquake, though nothing could be more terrible in its\r\nnature, or more immediately directing to the invisible Power, which\r\nalone directs such things, yet no sooner was the first fright over, but\r\nthe impression it had made went off also. I had no more sense of God or\r\nHis judgments, much less of the present affliction of my circumstances\r\nbeing from His hand, than if I had been in the most prosperous\r\ncondition of life.\r\n\r\nBut now, when I began to be sick, and a leisurely view of the miseries\r\nof death came to place itself before me; when my spirits began to sink\r\nunder the burden of a strong distemper, and Nature was exhausted with\r\nthe violence of the fever; conscience, that had slept so long, began to\r\nawake, and I began to reproach myself with my past life, in which I had\r\nso evidently, by uncommon wickedness, provoked the justice of God to\r\nlay me under uncommon strokes, and to deal with me in so vindictive a\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThese reflections oppressed me for the second or third day of my\r\ndistemper; and in the violence, as well of the fever as of the dreadful\r\nreproaches of my conscience, extorted some words from me, like praying\r\nto God, though I cannot say they were either a prayer attended with\r\ndesires or with hopes; it was rather the voice of mere fright and\r\ndistress. My thoughts were confused, the convictions great upon my\r\nmind, and the horror of dying in such a miserable condition, raised\r\nvapors into my head with the mere apprehensions; and in these hurries\r\nof my soul, I know not what my tongue might express; but it was rather\r\nexclamation, such as, “Lord! what a miserable creature am I! If I\r\nshould be sick, I shall certainly die for want of help; and what will\r\nbecome of me?” Then the tears burst out of my eyes, and I could say no\r\nmore for a good while.\r\n\r\nIn this interval, the good advice of my father came to my mind, and\r\npresently his prediction, which I mentioned at the beginning of this\r\nstory, viz., that if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless\r\nme, and I would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected\r\nhis counsel, when there might be none to assist in my recovery. “Now,”\r\nsaid I aloud, “my dear father’s words are come to pass; God’s justice\r\nhas overtaken me, and I have none to help or hear me. I rejected the\r\nvoice of Providence, which had mercifully put me in a posture or\r\nstation of life wherein I might have been happy and easy; but I would\r\nneither see it myself, or learn to know the blessing of it from my\r\nparents. I left them to mourn over my folly, and now I am left to mourn\r\nunder the consequences of it. I refused their help and assistance, who\r\nwould have lifted me into the world, and would have made everything\r\neasy to me; and now I have difficulties to struggle with, too great for\r\neven Nature itself to support, and no assistance, no help, no comfort,\r\nno advice.” Then I cried out, “Lord, be my help, for I am in great\r\ndistress.”\r\n\r\nThis was the first prayer, if I may call it so, that I had made for\r\nmany years. But I return to my journal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n_His Recovery--His Comfort in Reading the Scriptures--He Makes an\r\nExcursion into the Interior of the Island--Forms His “Bower”_\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 28._--Having been somewhat refreshed with the sleep I had had,\r\nand the fit being entirely off, I got up; and though the fright and\r\nterror of my dream was very great, yet I considered that the fit of\r\nthe ague would return again the next day, and now was my time to get\r\nsomething to refresh and support myself when I should be ill. And the\r\nfirst thing I did I filled a large square case-bottle with water, and\r\nset it upon my table, in reach of my bed; and to take off the chill or\r\naguish disposition of the water, I put about a quarter of a pint of rum\r\ninto it, and mixed them together. Then I got me a piece of the goat’s\r\nflesh, and broiled it on the coals, but could eat very little. I walked\r\nabout, but was very weak, and withal very sad and heavy-hearted in the\r\nsense of my miserable condition, dreading the return of my distemper\r\nthe next day. At night I made my supper of three of the turtle’s eggs,\r\nwhich I roasted in the ashes, and eat, as we call it, in the shell; and\r\nthis was the first bit of meat I had ever asked God’s blessing to, even\r\nas I could remember, in my whole life.\r\n\r\nAfter I had eaten, I tried to walk, but found myself so weak, that I\r\ncould hardly carry the gun (for I never went out without that); so I\r\nwent but a little way, and sat down upon the ground, looking out upon\r\nthe sea, which was just before me, and very calm and smooth. As I sat\r\nthere, some such thoughts as these occurred to me.\r\n\r\nWhat is this earth and sea, of which I have seen so much? whence is it\r\nproduced? And what am I, and all the other creatures, wild and tame,\r\nhuman and brutal, whence are we? Sure we are all made by some secret\r\nPower, who formed the earth and sea, the air and sky. And who is that?\r\n\r\nThen it followed most naturally, It is God that has made it all. Well,\r\nbut then it came on strangely, if God has made all these things, He\r\nguides and governs them all, and all things that concern them; for the\r\nPower that could make all things, must certainly have power to guide\r\nand direct them.\r\n\r\nIf so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of His works, either\r\nwithout His knowledge or appointment. And if nothing happens without\r\nHis knowledge, He knows that I am here, and am in this dreadful\r\ncondition. And if nothing happens without His appointment, He has\r\nappointed all this to befall me.\r\n\r\nNothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict any of these conclusion;\r\nand therefore it rested upon me with the greater force, that it must\r\nneeds be that God had appointed all this to befall me; that I was\r\nbrought to this miserable circumstance by His direction, He having the\r\nsole power, not of me only, but of everything that happened in the\r\nworld. Immediately it followed, Why has God done this to me? What have\r\nI done to be thus used?\r\n\r\nMy conscience presently checked me in that inquiry, as if I had\r\nblasphemed, and methought it spoke to me like a voice: “Wretch! dost\r\nthou ask what thou hast done? Look back upon a dreadful misspent life,\r\nand ask thyself what thou hast not done? Ask, Why is it that thou wert\r\nnot long ago destroyed? Why wert thou not drowned in Yarmouth Roads;\r\nkilled in the fight when the ship was taken by the Sallee man-of-war;\r\ndevoured by the wild beasts on the coast of Africa; or drowned here,\r\nwhen all the crew perished but thyself? Dost thou ask, What have I\r\ndone?”\r\n\r\nI was struck dumb with these reflections, as one astonished, and had\r\nnot a word to say, no, not to answer to myself, but rose up pensive and\r\nsad, walked back to my retreat, and went up over my wall, as if I had\r\nbeen going to bed. But my thoughts were sadly disturbed, and I had no\r\ninclination to sleep; so I sat down in my chair, and lighted my lamp,\r\nfor it began to be dark. Now, as the apprehension of the return of my\r\ndistemper terrified me very much, it occurred to my thought that the\r\nBrazilians take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers;\r\nand I had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests, which was\r\nquite cured, and some also that was green, and not quite cured.\r\n\r\nI went, directed by Heaven no doubt; for in this chest I found a cure\r\nboth for soul and body. I opened the chest, and found what I looked\r\nfor, viz., the tobacco; and as the few books I had saved lay there too,\r\nI took out one of the Bibles which I mentioned before, and which to\r\nthis time I had not found leisure, or so much as inclination, to look\r\ninto. I say, I took it out, and brought both that and the tobacco with\r\nme to the table.\r\n\r\nWhat use to make of the tobacco I knew not, as to my distemper, or\r\nwhether it was good for it or no; but I tried several experiments with\r\nit, as if I was resolved it should hit one way or other. I first took\r\na piece of a leaf, and chewed it in my mouth, which indeed at first\r\nalmost stupefied my brain, the tobacco being green and strong, and that\r\nI had not been much used to it. Then I took some and steeped it an hour\r\nor two in some rum, and resolved to take a dose of it when I lay down.\r\nAnd lastly, I burnt some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose close\r\nover the smoke of it, as long as I could bear it, as well for the heat,\r\nas almost for suffocation.\r\n\r\nIn the interval of this operation, I took up the Bible, and began to\r\nread, but my head was too much disturbed with the tobacco to bear\r\nreading, at least that time; only having opened the book casually, the\r\nfirst words that occurred to me were these, “Call on Me in the day of\r\ntrouble, and I will deliver, and thou shalt glorify Me.”\r\n\r\nThe words were very apt to my case, and made some impression upon my\r\nthoughts at the time of reading them, though not so much as they did\r\nafterwards; for as for being delivered, the word had no sound, as I may\r\nsay, to me, the thing was so remote, so impossible in my apprehension\r\nof things, that I began to say, as the children of Israel did when they\r\nwere promised flesh to eat, “Can God spread a table in the wilderness?”\r\nso I began to say, Can God Himself deliver me from this place? And as\r\nit was not for many years that any hope appeared, this prevailed very\r\noften upon my thoughts. But, however, the words made a great impression\r\nupon me, and I mused upon them very often.\r\n\r\nIt grew now late, and the tobacco had, as I said, dazed my head so\r\nmuch, that I inclined to sleep; so I left my lamp burning in the cave,\r\nlest I should want anything in the night, and went to bed. But before\r\nI lay down, I did what I never had done in all my life; I kneeled\r\ndown, and prayed to God to fulfil the promise to me, that if I called\r\nupon Him in the day of trouble, He would deliver me. After my broken\r\nand imperfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in which I had steeped\r\nthe tobacco; which was so strong and rank of the tobacco, that indeed\r\nI could scarce get it down. Immediately upon this I went to bed. I\r\nfound presently it flew up in my head violently; but I fell into a\r\nsound sleep, and waked no more till, by the sun, it must necessarily\r\nbe near three o’clock in the afternoon the next day. Nay, to this hour\r\nI am partly of the opinion that I slept all the next day and night,\r\nand till almost three that day after; for otherwise I knew not how I\r\nshould lose a day out of my reckoning in the days of the week, as it\r\nappeared some years after I had done. For if I had lost it by crossing\r\nand re-crossing the line, I should have lost more than one day. But\r\ncertainly I lost a day in my account, and never knew which way.\r\n\r\nBe that, however, one way or the other, when I awaked I found myself\r\nexceedingly refreshed, and my spirits lively and cheerful. When I got\r\nup, I was stronger than I was the day before, and my stomach better,\r\nfor I was hungry; and, in short, I had no fit the next day, but\r\ncontinued much altered for the better. This was the 29th.\r\n\r\nThe 30th was my well day, of course, and I went abroad with my gun, but\r\ndid not care to travel too far. I killed a seafowl or two, something\r\nlike a brand goose, and brought them home, but was not very forward\r\nto eat them; so I eat some more of the turtle’s eggs, which were very\r\ngood. This evening I renewed the medicine, which I had supposed did me\r\ngood the day before, viz., the tobacco steeped in rum; only I did not\r\ntake so much as before, nor did I chew any of the leaf, or hold my head\r\nover the smoke. However, I was not so well the next day, which was the\r\nfirst of July, as I hoped I should have been; for I had a little spice\r\nof the cold fit, but it was not much.\r\n\r\n_July 2._--I renewed the medicine all the three ways; and dosed myself\r\nwith it as at first, and doubled the quantity which I drank.\r\n\r\n_July 3._--I missed the fit for good and all, though I did not recover\r\nmy full strength for some weeks after. While I was thus gathering\r\nstrength, my thoughts ran exceedingly upon this Scripture, “I will\r\ndeliver thee”; and the impossibility of my deliverance lay much upon\r\nmy mind, in bar of my ever expecting it. But as I was discouraging\r\nmyself with such thoughts, it occurred to my mind that I pored so\r\nmuch upon my deliverance from the main affliction, that I disregarded\r\nthe deliverance I had received; and I was, as it were, made to ask\r\nmyself such questions as these, viz., Have I not been delivered, and\r\nwonderfully too, from sickness? from the most distressed condition\r\nthat could be, and that was so frightful to me? and what notice had I\r\ntaken of it? Had I done my part? God had delivered me, but I had not\r\nglorified Him; that is to say, I had not owned and been thankful for\r\nthat as a deliverance; and how could I expect greater deliverance?\r\n\r\nThis touched my heart very much; and immediately I kneeled down, and\r\ngave God thanks aloud for my recovery from my sickness.\r\n\r\n_July 4._--In the morning I took the Bible; and beginning at the New\r\nTestament, I began seriously to read it, and imposed upon myself to\r\nread awhile every morning and every night, not tying myself to the\r\nnumber of chapters, but as long as my thoughts should engage me. It was\r\nnot long after I set seriously to this work, but I found my heart more\r\ndeeply and sincerely affected with the wickedness of my past life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_In the morning I took the Bible; and beginning at the\r\nNew Testament, I began seriously to read it--_”]\r\n\r\nThe impression of my dream revived, and the words, “All these things\r\nhave not brought thee to repentance” ran seriously in my thought. I\r\nwas earnestly begging of God to give me repentance, when it happened\r\nprovidentially, the very day, that, reading the Scripture, I came to\r\nthese words, “He is exalted a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance,\r\nand to give remission.” I threw down the book; and with my heart as\r\nwell as my hands lifted up to heaven, in a kind of ecstasy of joy, I\r\ncried out aloud, “Jesus, Thou son of David! Jesus, Thou exalted Prince\r\nand Savior, give me repentance!”\r\n\r\nThis was the first time that I could say, in the true sense of the\r\nwords, that I prayed in all my life; for now I prayed with a sense\r\nof my condition, and with a true Scripture view of hope founded on the\r\nencouragement of the Word of God; and from this time, I may say, I\r\nbegan to have hope that God would hear me.\r\n\r\nNow I began to construe the words mentioned above, “Call on Me, and\r\nI will deliver you,” in a different sense from what I had ever done\r\nbefore; for then I had no notion of anything being called deliverance\r\nbut my being delivered from the captivity I was in; for though I was\r\nindeed at large in the place, yet the island was certainly a prison\r\nto me, and that in the worst sense in the world. But now I learned to\r\ntake it in another sense; now I looked back upon my past life with\r\nsuch horror, and my sins appeared so dreadful, that my soul sought\r\nnothing of God but deliverance from the load of guilt that bore down\r\nall my comfort. As for my solitary life, it was nothing; I did not so\r\nmuch as pray to be delivered from it or think of it; it was all of no\r\nconsideration, in comparison to this. And I add this part here, to hint\r\nto whoever shall read it, that whenever they come to a true sense of\r\nthings, they will find deliverance from sin a much greater blessing\r\nthan deliverance from affliction.\r\n\r\nBut leaving this part, I return to my journal.\r\n\r\nMy condition began now to be, though not less miserable as to my way of\r\nliving, yet much easier to my mind; and my thoughts being directed, by\r\na constant reading the Scripture, and praying to God, to things of a\r\nhigher nature, I had a great deal of comfort within, which, till now, I\r\nknew nothing of. Also, as my health and strength returned, I bestirred\r\nmyself to furnish myself with everything that I wanted, and make my\r\nway of living as regular as I could.\r\n\r\nFrom the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly employed in walking\r\nabout with my gun in my hand, a little and a little at a time, as a\r\nman that was gathering up his strength after a fit of sickness; for\r\nit is hardly to be imagined how low I was, and to what weakness I was\r\nreduced. The application which I made use of was perfectly new, and\r\nperhaps what had never cured an ague before; neither can I recommend it\r\nto any one to practise, by this experiment; and though it did carry off\r\nthe fit, yet it rather contributed to weakening me; for I had frequent\r\nconvulsions in my nerves and limbs for some time.\r\n\r\nI learnt from it also this, in particular, that being abroad in the\r\nrainy season was the most pernicious thing to my health that could\r\nbe, especially in those rains which came attended with storms and\r\nhurricanes of wind; for as the rain which came in the dry season was\r\nalways most accompanied with such storms, so I found that rain was much\r\nmore dangerous than the rain which fell in September and October.\r\n\r\nI had been now in this unhappy island above ten months; all possibility\r\nof deliverance from this condition seemed to be entirely taken from\r\nme; and I firmly believed that no human shape had ever set foot upon\r\nthat place. Having now secured my habitation, as I thought, fully to\r\nmy mind, I had a great desire to make a more perfect discovery of the\r\nisland, and to see what other productions I might find, which I yet\r\nknew nothing of.\r\n\r\nIt was the 15th of July that I began to take a more particular survey\r\nof the island itself. I went up the creek first, where, as I hinted, I\r\nbrought my rafts on shore. I found, after I came about two miles up,\r\nthat the tide did not flow any higher, and that it was no more than a\r\nlittle brook of running water, and very fresh and good; but this being\r\nthe dry season, there was hardly any water in some parts of it, at\r\nleast, not enough to run in any stream, so as it could be perceived.\r\n\r\nOn the bank of this brook I found many pleasant savannas or meadows,\r\nplain, smooth, and covered with grass; and on the rising parts of them,\r\nnext to the higher grounds, where the water, as might be supposed,\r\nnever overflowed, I found a great deal of tobacco, green, and growing\r\nto a great and very strong stalk. There were divers other plants, which\r\nI had no notion of, or understanding about, and might perhaps have\r\nvirtues of their own, which I could not find out.\r\n\r\nI searched for the cassava root, which the Indians, in all that\r\nclimate, make their bread of, but I could find none. I saw large plants\r\nof aloes, but did not then understand them. I saw several sugar-canes,\r\nbut wild, and, for want of cultivation, imperfect.\r\n\r\nI contented myself with these discoveries for this time, and came back,\r\nmusing with myself what course I might take to know the virtue and\r\ngoodness of any of the fruits or plants which I should discover; but\r\ncould bring it to no conclusion; for, in short, I had made so little\r\nobservation while I was in the Brazils, that I knew little of the\r\nplants in the field, at least very little that might serve me to any\r\npurpose now in my distress.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 16th, I went up the same way again; and after going\r\nsomething farther than I had gone the day before, I found the brook and\r\nthe savannas began to cease, and the country became more woody than\r\nbefore. In this part I found different fruits, and particularly I found\r\nmelons upon the ground in great abundance, and grapes upon the trees.\r\nThe vines had spread indeed over the trees, and the clusters of grapes\r\nwere just now in their prime, very ripe and rich. This was a surprising\r\ndiscovery, and I was exceeding glad of them; but I was warned by my\r\nexperience to eat sparingly of them, remembering that when I was ashore\r\nin Barbary eating of grapes killed several of our Englishmen, who were\r\nslaves there, by throwing them into fluxes and fevers. But I found an\r\nexcellent use for these grapes; and that was, to cure or dry them in\r\nthe sun, and keep them as dried grapes or raisins are kept, which I\r\nthought would be, as indeed they were, as wholesome as agreeable to\r\neat, when no grapes might be to be had.\r\n\r\nI spent all that evening there, and went not back to my habitation;\r\nwhich, by the way, was the first night, as I might say, I had lain\r\nfrom home. In the night, I took my first contrivance, and got up into\r\na tree, where I slept well; and the next morning proceeded upon my\r\ndiscovery, travelling near four miles, as I might judge by the length\r\nof the valley, keeping still due north, with a ridge of hills on the\r\nsouth and north side of me.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this march I came to an opening, where the country seemed\r\nto descend to the west; and a little spring of fresh water, which\r\nissued out of the side of the hill by me, ran the other way, that is,\r\ndue east; and the country appeared so fresh, so green, so flourishing,\r\neverything being in a constant verdure or flourish of spring, that it\r\nlooked like a planted garden.\r\n\r\nI descended a little on the side of that delicious vale, surveying it\r\nwith a secret kind of pleasure, though mixed with my other afflicting\r\nthoughts, to think that this was all my own; that I was king and lord\r\nof all this country indefeasibly, and had a right of possession; and,\r\nif I could convey it, I might have it in inheritance as completely as\r\nany lord of a manor in England.\r\n\r\nI saw here abundance of cocoa trees, orange, and lemon, and citron\r\ntrees; but all wild, and very few bearing fruit, at least not then.\r\nHowever, the green limes that I gathered were not only pleasant to eat,\r\nbut very wholesome; and I mixed their juice afterwards with water,\r\nwhich made it very wholesome, and very cool and refreshing.\r\n\r\nI found now I had business enough to gather and carry home; and I\r\nresolved to lay up a store, as well of grapes as limes and lemons to\r\nfurnish myself for the wet season, which I knew was approaching.\r\n\r\nIn order to do this, I gathered a great heap of grapes in one place,\r\nand a lesser heap in another place, and a great parcel of limes and\r\nlemons in another place; and taking a few of each with me, I travelled\r\nhomeward; and resolved to come again, and bring a bag or sack, or what\r\nI could make, to carry the rest home.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, having spent three days in this journey, I came home (so\r\nI must now call my tent and my cave); but before I got thither, the\r\ngrapes were spoiled; the richness of the fruits, and the weight of the\r\njuice, having broken them and bruised them, they were good for little\r\nor nothing: as to the limes, they were good, but I could bring but a\r\nfew.\r\n\r\nThe next day, being the 19th, I went back, having made me two small\r\nbags to bring home my harvest; but I was surprised, when, coming to my\r\nheap of grapes, which were so rich and fine when I gathered them, I\r\nfound them all spread about, trod to pieces, and dragged about, some\r\nhere, some there, and abundance eaten and devoured. By this I concluded\r\nthere were some wild creatures thereabouts, which had done this; but\r\nwhat they were, I knew not.\r\n\r\nHowever, as I found that there was no laying them up on heaps, and no\r\ncarrying them away in a sack, but that one way they would be destroyed,\r\nand the other way they would be crushed with their own weight, I took\r\nanother course; for I gathered a large quantity of the grapes, and hung\r\nthem up upon the out-branches of the trees, that they might cure and\r\ndry in the sun; and as for the limes and lemons, I carried as many back\r\nas I could stand under.\r\n\r\nWhen I came home from this journey, I contemplated with great pleasure\r\nthe fruitfulness of that valley, and the pleasantness of the situation;\r\nthe security from storms on that side the water and the wood; and\r\nconcluded that I had pitched upon a place to fix my abode, which\r\nwas by far the worst part of the country. Upon the whole, I began to\r\nconsider of removing my habitation, and to look out for a place equally\r\nsafe as where I now was situate, if possible, in that pleasant fruitful\r\npart of the island.\r\n\r\nThis thought ran long in my head, and I was exceeding fond of it\r\nfor some time, the pleasantness of the place tempting me; but when\r\nI came to a nearer view of it and to consider that I was now by the\r\nseaside, where it was at least possible that something might happen\r\nto my advantage, and, by the same ill fate that brought me hither,\r\nmight bring some other unhappy wretches to the same place; and though\r\nit was scarce probable that any such thing should ever happen, yet to\r\nenclose myself among the hills and woods in the centre of the island,\r\nwas to anticipate my bondage, and to render such an affair not only\r\nimprobable, but impossible; and that therefore I ought not by any means\r\nto remove.\r\n\r\nHowever, I was so enamored of this place, that I spent much of my time\r\nthere for the whole remaining part of the month of July; and, though,\r\nupon second thoughts, I resolved, as above, not to remove, yet I built\r\nme a little kind of a bower, and surrounded it at a distance with a\r\nstrong fence, being a double hedge as high as I could reach, well\r\nstaked, and filled between with brushwood. And here I lay very secure,\r\nsometimes two or three nights together, always going over it with a\r\nladder, as before; so that I fancied now I had my country house and my\r\nseacoast house; and this work took me up to the beginning of August.\r\n\r\nI had but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy my labor, but\r\nthe rains came on, and made me stick close to my first habitation; for\r\nthough I had made me a tent like the other, with a piece of a sail, and\r\nspread it very well, yet I had not the shelter of a hill to keep me\r\nfrom storms, nor a cave behind me to retreat into when the rains were\r\nextraordinary.\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished my bower, and\r\nbegan to enjoy myself. The 3rd of August, I found the grapes I had hung\r\nup were perfectly dried, and indeed were excellent good raisins of the\r\nsun; so I began to take them down from the trees. And it was very happy\r\nthat I did so, for the rains which followed would have spoiled them,\r\nand I had lost the best part of my winter food; for I had above two\r\nhundred large bunches of them. No sooner had I taken them all down, and\r\ncarried most of them home to my cave, but it began to rain; and from\r\nhence, which was the 14th of August, it rained, more or less, every day\r\ntill the middle of October, and sometimes so violently, that I could\r\nnot stir out of my cave for several days.\r\n\r\nIn this season, I was much surprised with the increase of my family.\r\nI had been concerned for the loss of one of my cats, who ran away\r\nfrom me, or, as I thought, had been dead, and I heard no more tale or\r\ntidings of her, till, to my astonishment, she came home about the end\r\nof August with three kittens. This was the more strange to me, because,\r\nthough I had killed a wild cat, as I called it, with my gun, yet I\r\nthought it was a quite different kind from our European cats; yet the\r\nyoung cats were the same kind of house-breed like the old one; and both\r\nmy cats being females, I thought it very strange. But from these three\r\ncats I afterwards came to be so pestered with cats, that I was forced\r\nto kill them like vermin, or wild beasts, and to drive them from my\r\nhouse as much as possible.\r\n\r\nFrom the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain, so that I could\r\nnot stir, and was now very careful not to be much wet. In this\r\nconfinement, I began to be straitened for food; but venturing out\r\ntwice, I one day killed a goat, and the last day, which was the 26th,\r\nfound a very large tortoise, which was a treat to me, and my food was\r\nregulated thus: I ate a bunch of raisins for my breakfast, a piece of\r\nthe goat’s flesh, or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled; for, to my\r\ngreat misfortune, I had no vessel to boil or stew anything; and two or\r\nthree of the turtle’s eggs for my supper.\r\n\r\nDuring this confinement in my cover by the rain, I worked daily two or\r\nthree hours at enlarging my cave, and by degrees worked it on towards\r\none side, till I came to the outside of the hill, and made a door, or\r\nway out, which came beyond my fence or wall; and so I came in and out\r\nthis way. But I was not perfectly easy at lying so open; for as I had\r\nmanaged myself before, I was in a perfect enclosure; whereas now, I\r\nthought I lay exposed, and open for anything to come in upon me; and\r\nyet I could not perceive that there was any living thing to fear, the\r\nbiggest creature that I had yet seen upon the island being a goat.\r\n\r\n_Sept. 30._--I was now come to the unhappy anniversary of my landing.\r\nI cast up the notches on my post, and found I had been on shore three\r\nhundred and sixty-five days. I kept this day as a solemn fast, setting\r\nit apart to religious exercise, prostrating myself on the ground with\r\nthe most serious humiliation, confessing my sins to God, acknowledging\r\nHis righteous judgments upon me, and praying to Him to have mercy on\r\nme through Jesus Christ; and having not tasted the least refreshment\r\nfor twelve hours, even till the going down of the sun, I then ate a\r\nbiscuit-cake and a bunch of grapes, and went to bed, finishing the day\r\nas I began it.\r\n\r\nI had all this time observed no Sabbath day, for as at first I had no\r\nsense of religion upon my mind, I had, after some time, omitted to\r\ndistinguish the weeks, by making a longer notch than ordinary for the\r\nSabbath day, and so did not really know what any of the days were. But\r\nnow, having cast up the days, as above, I found I had been there a\r\nyear, so I divided it into weeks, and set apart every seventh day for a\r\nSabbath; though I found at the end of my account, I had lost a day or\r\ntwo in my reckoning.\r\n\r\nA little after this my ink began to fail me, and so I contented myself\r\nto use it more sparingly, and to write down only the most remarkable\r\nevents of my life, without continuing a daily memorandum of other\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nThe rainy season and the dry season began now to appear regular to me,\r\nand I learned to divide them so as to provide for them accordingly;\r\nbut I bought all my experience before I had it, and this I am going\r\nto relate was one of the most discouraging experiments that I made\r\nat all. I have mentioned that I had saved the few ears of barley and\r\nrice, which I had so surprisingly found spring up, as I thought, of\r\nthemselves, and believe there were about thirty stalks of rice, and\r\nabout twenty of barley; and now I thought it a proper time to sow it\r\nafter the rains, the sun being in its southern position, going from me.\r\n\r\nAccordingly I dug up a piece of ground as well as I could with my\r\nwooden spade, and dividing it into two parts, I sowed my grain; but as\r\nI was sowing, it casually occurred to my thoughts that I would not sow\r\nit all at first, because I did not know when was the proper time for\r\nit, so I sowed about two-thirds of the seed, leaving about a handful of\r\neach.\r\n\r\nIt was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did so, for not one\r\ngrain of that I sowed this time came to anything, for the dry months\r\nfollowing, the earth having had no rain after the seed was sown, it had\r\nno moisture to assist its growth, and never came up at all till the wet\r\nseason had come again, and then it grew as if it had been but newly\r\nsown.\r\n\r\nFinding my first seed did not grow, which I easily imagined was by the\r\ndrought, I sought for a moister piece of ground to make another trial\r\nin, and I dug up a piece of ground near my new bower, and sowed the\r\nrest of my seed in February, a little before the vernal equinox. And\r\nthis having the rainy months of March and April to water it, sprung up\r\nvery pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop; but having part of the\r\nseed left only, and not daring to sow all that I had, I had but a small\r\nquantity at last, my whole crop not amounting to above half a peck of\r\neach kind. But by this experiment I was made master of my business,\r\nand knew exactly when the proper season was to sow, and that I might\r\nexpect two seed-times and two harvests every year.\r\n\r\nWhile this corn was growing, I made a little discovery, which was of\r\nuse to me afterwards. As soon as the rains were over, and the weather\r\nbegan to settle, which was about the month of November, I made a visit\r\nup the country to my bower, where, though I had not been some months,\r\nyet I found all things just as I left them. The circle or double hedge\r\nthat I had made was not only firm and entire, but the stakes which I\r\nhad cut out of some trees that grew thereabouts were all shot out, and\r\ngrown with long branches, as much as a willow-tree usually shoots the\r\nfirst year after lopping its head. I could not tell what tree to call\r\nit that these stakes were cut from. I was surprised, and yet very well\r\npleased to see the young trees grow, and I pruned them, and led them\r\nup to grow as much alike as I could. And it is scarce credible how\r\nbeautiful a figure they grew into in three years; so that though the\r\nhedge made a circle of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the\r\ntrees, for such I might now call them, soon covered it, and it was a\r\ncomplete shade, sufficient to lodge under all the dry season.\r\n\r\nThis made me resolve to cut some more stakes, and make me a hedge like\r\nthis, in a semicircle round my wall (I mean that of my first dwelling),\r\nwhich I did; and placing the trees or stakes in a double row, at about\r\neight yards distance from my first fence, they grew presently, and were\r\nat first a fine cover to my habitation, and afterward served for a\r\ndefence also, as I shall observe in its order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n_Robinson Makes a Tour to Explore His Island--Employed in Basket Making_\r\n\r\n\r\nI found now that the seasons of the year might generally be divided,\r\nnot into summer and winter, as in Europe, but into the rainy seasons\r\nand the dry seasons. The rainy season sometimes held longer or shorter\r\nas the winds happened to blow, but this was the general observation\r\nI made. After I had found by experience the ill consequence of being\r\nabroad in the rain, I took care to furnish myself with provisions\r\nbeforehand, that I might not be obliged to go out; and I sat within\r\ndoors as much as possible during the wet months.\r\n\r\nIn this time I found much employment, and very suitable also to the\r\ntime, for I found great occasion of many things which I had no way\r\nto furnish myself with but by hard labor and constant application;\r\nparticularly, I tried many ways to make myself a basket; but all the\r\ntwigs I could get for the purpose proved so brittle, that they would\r\ndo nothing. It proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when I\r\nwas a boy I used to take great delight in standing at a basket-maker’s\r\nin the town where my father lived, to see them make their wicker-ware;\r\nand being, as boys usually are, very officious to help, and a great\r\nobserver of the manner how they worked those things, and sometimes\r\nlending a hand, I had by this means full knowledge of the methods of\r\nit, that I wanted nothing but the materials; when it came into my mind\r\nthat the twigs of that tree from whence I cut my stakes that grew\r\nmight possibly be as tough as the sallows, and willows, and osiers in\r\nEngland, and I resolved to try.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the next day, I went to my country house, as I called it;\r\nand cutting some of the smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as\r\nmuch as I could desire; whereupon I came the next time prepared with\r\na hatchet to cut down a quantity, which I soon found, for there was\r\nplenty of them. These I set up to dry within my circle or hedge, and\r\nwhen they were fit for use, I carried them to my cave; and here during\r\nthe next season I employed myself in making, as well as I could, a\r\ngreat many baskets, both to carry earth, or to lay up anything as I had\r\noccasion. And though I did not finish them very handsomely, yet I made\r\nthem sufficiently serviceable for my purpose. And thus, afterwards, I\r\ntook care never to be without them; and as my wicker-ware decayed, I\r\nmade more, especially I made strong deep baskets to place my corn in,\r\ninstead of sacks, when I should come to have any quantity of it.\r\n\r\nHaving mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of time about it,\r\nI bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to supply two wants. I had\r\nno vessels to hold anything that was liquid, except two runlets, which\r\nwere almost full of rum, and some glass bottles, some of the common\r\nsize, and others which were case-bottles square, for the holding of\r\nwaters, spirits, etc. I had not so much as a pot to boil anything,\r\nexcept a great kettle, which I saved out of the ship, and which was\r\ntoo big for such use as I desired it, viz., to make broth, and stew\r\na bit of meat by itself. The second thing I would fain have had was\r\na tobacco-pipe; but it was impossible for me to make one. However, I\r\nfound a contrivance for that, too, at last.\r\n\r\nI employed myself in planting my second rows of stakes or piles and in\r\nthis wicker-working all the summer or dry season, when another business\r\ntook me up more time than it could be imagined I could spare.\r\n\r\nI mentioned before that I had a great mind to see the whole island, and\r\nthat I had travelled up the brook, and so on to where I built my bower,\r\nand where I had an opening quite to the sea, on the other side of the\r\nisland. I now resolved to travel quite across to the seashore on that\r\nside; so taking my gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity of\r\npowder and shot than usual, with two biscuit-cakes and a great bunch of\r\nraisins in my pouch for my store, I began my journey. When I had passed\r\nthe vale where my bower stood, as above, I came within view of the sea\r\nto the west; and it being a very clear day, I fairly descried land,\r\nwhether an island or a continent I could not tell; but it lay very\r\nhigh, extending from the west to the W.S.W. at a very great distance;\r\nby my guess, it could not be less than fifteen or twenty leagues off.\r\n\r\nI could not tell what part of the world this might be, otherwise than\r\nthat I knew it must be part of America, and, as I concluded, by all\r\nmy observations, must be near the Spanish dominions, and perhaps was\r\nall inhabited by savages, where, if I should have landed, I had been\r\nin a worse condition than I was now; and therefore I acquiesced in the\r\ndispositions of Providence, which I began now to own and to believe\r\nordered everything for the best. I say, I quieted my mind with this,\r\nand left afflicting myself with fruitless wishes of being there.\r\n\r\nBesides, after some pause upon this affair, I considered that if this\r\nland was the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one time or other, see\r\nsome vessel pass or repass one way or other; but if not, then it was\r\nthe savage coast between the Spanish country and Brazils, which are\r\nindeed the worst of savages; for they are cannibals or men-eaters, and\r\nfail not to murder and devour all the human bodies that fall into their\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nWith these considerations I walked very leisurely forward. I found that\r\nside of the island, where I now was, much pleasanter than mine, the\r\nopen or savanna fields sweet, adorned with flowers and full of very\r\nfine woods.\r\n\r\nI saw abundance of parrots, and fain I would have caught one, if\r\npossible, to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak to me. I\r\ndid, after some painstaking, catch a young parrot, for I knocked it\r\ndown with a stick, and having recovered it, I brought it home; but\r\nit was some years before I could make him speak. However, at last I\r\ntaught him to call me by my name very familiarly. But the accident that\r\nfollowed, though it be a trifle, will be very diverting in its place.\r\n\r\nI was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I found in the low\r\ngrounds hares, as I thought them to be, and foxes; but they differed\r\ngreatly from all the other kinds I had met with, nor could I satisfy\r\nmyself to eat them, though I killed several. But I had no need to be\r\nventurous, for I had no want of food, and of that which was very good\r\ntoo; especially these three sorts, viz., goats, pigeons, and turtle,\r\nor tortoise; which, added to my grapes, Leadenhall Market could not\r\nhave furnished a table better than I, in proportion to the company.\r\nAnd though my case was deplorable enough, yet I had great cause for\r\nthankfulness, and that I was not driven to any extremities for food,\r\nbut rather plenty, even to dainties.\r\n\r\nI never travelled in this journey above two miles outright in a day,\r\nor thereabouts; but I took so many turns and returns, to see what\r\ndiscoveries I could make, that I came weary enough to the place where\r\nI resolved to sit down for all night; and then I either reposed myself\r\nin a tree, or surrounded myself with a row of stakes, set upright in\r\nthe ground, either from one tree to another, or so as no wild creature\r\ncould come at me without waking me.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I came to the seashore, I was surprised to see that I had\r\ntaken up my lot on the worst side of the island, for here indeed the\r\nshore was covered with innumerable turtles; whereas, on the other side,\r\nI had found but three in a year and a half. Here was also an infinite\r\nnumber of fowls of many kinds, some which I had seen, and some which\r\nI had not seen before, and many of them very good meat, but such as I\r\nknew not the names of except those called penguins.\r\n\r\nI could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing of my\r\npowder and shot, and therefore had more mind to kill a she-goat, if\r\nI could, which I could better feed on; and though there were many\r\ngoats here, more than on my side the island, yet it was with much more\r\ndifficulty that I could come near them, the country being flat and\r\neven, and they saw me much sooner than when I was on the hill.\r\n\r\nI confess this side of the country was much pleasanter than mine; but\r\nyet I had not the least inclination to remove, for as I was fixed in\r\nmy habitation, it became natural to me, and I seemed all the while I\r\nwas here to be as it were upon a journey, and from home. However, I\r\ntravelled along the shore of the sea towards the east, I suppose about\r\ntwelve miles, and then setting up a great pole upon the shore for a\r\nmark, I concluded I would go home again; and that the next journey I\r\ntook should be on the other side of the island, east from my dwelling,\r\nand so round till I came to my post again; of which in its place.\r\n\r\nI took another way to come back than that I went, thinking I could\r\neasily keep all the island so much in my view, that I could not miss\r\nfinding my first dwelling by viewing the country. But I found myself\r\nmistaken; for being come about two or three miles, I found myself\r\ndescended into a very large valley, but so surrounded with hills, and\r\nthose hills covered with wood, that I could not see which was my way by\r\nany direction but that of the sun, nor even then, unless I knew very\r\nwell the position of the sun at that time of the day.\r\n\r\nIt happened to my farther misfortune, that the weather proved hazy\r\nfor three or four days while I was in this valley; and not being able\r\nto see the sun, I wandered about very uncomfortably, and at last was\r\nobliged to find out the seaside, look for my post, and come back the\r\nsame way I went; and then by easy journeys I turned homeward, the\r\nweather being exceeding hot, and my gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other\r\nthings very heavy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n_He Returns to His Cave--His Agricultural Labors and Success_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and seized upon it, and I\r\nrunning in to take hold of it, caught it, and saved it alive from the\r\ndog. I had a great mind to bring it home if I could, for I had often\r\nbeen musing whether it might not be possible to get a kid or two, and\r\nso raise a breed of tame goats, which might supply me when my powder\r\nand shot should be all spent.\r\n\r\nI made a collar to this little creature, and with a string, which I\r\nmade of some rope-yarn, which I always carried about me, I led him\r\nalong, though with some difficulty, till I came to my bower, and there\r\nI enclosed him and left him, for I was very impatient to be at home,\r\nfrom whence I had been absent above a month.\r\n\r\nI cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come into my old\r\nhutch, and lie down in my hammock-bed. This little wandering journey,\r\nwithout settled place of abode, had been so unpleasant to me, that my\r\nown house, as I called it to myself, was a perfect settlement to be\r\ncompared to that; and it rendered everything about me so comfortable,\r\nthat I resolved I would never go a great way from it again, while it\r\nshould be my lot to stay on the island.\r\n\r\nI reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself after my long\r\njourney; during which most of the time was taken up in the weighty\r\naffair of making a cage for my Poll, who began now to be a mere\r\ndomestic, and to be mighty well acquainted with me. Then I began to\r\nthink of the poor kid which I had penned in within my little circle,\r\nand resolved to go and fetch it home, or give it some food. Accordingly\r\nI went, and found it where I left it, for indeed it could not get out,\r\nbut almost starved for want of food. I went and cut boughs of trees,\r\nand branches of such shrubs as I could find, and threw it over, and\r\nhaving fed it, I tied it as I did before, to lead it away; but it was\r\nso tame with being hungry, that I had no need to have tied it, for\r\nit followed me like a dog. And as I continually fed it, the creature\r\nbecame so loving, so gentle, and so fond, that it became from that time\r\none of my domestics also, and would never leave me afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come, and I kept\r\nthe 30th of September in the same solemn manner as before, being\r\nthe anniversary of my landing on the island, having now been there\r\ntwo years, and no more prospect of being delivered than the first\r\nday I came there. I spent the whole day in humble and thankful\r\nacknowledgments of the many wonderful mercies which my solitary\r\ncondition was attended with, and without which it might have been\r\ninfinitely more miserable. I gave humble and hearty thanks that God\r\nhad been pleased to discover to me even that it was possible I might\r\nbe more happy in this solitary condition, than I should have been in\r\na liberty of society, and in all the pleasures of the world; that He\r\ncould fully make up to me the deficiencies of my solitary state, and\r\nthe want of human society, by His presence, and the communications of\r\nHis grace to my soul, supporting, comforting, and encouraging me to\r\ndepend upon His providence here, and hope for His eternal presence\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nIt was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy this life\r\nI now led was, with all its miserable circumstances, than the wicked,\r\ncursed, abominable life I led all the past part of my days. And now\r\nI changed both my sorrows and my joys; my very desires altered, my\r\naffections changed their gusts, and my delights were perfectly new from\r\nwhat they were at my first coming, or indeed for the two years past.\r\n\r\nBefore, as I walked about, either on my hunting, or for viewing the\r\ncountry, the anguish of my soul at my condition would break out upon\r\nme on a sudden, and my very heart would die within me, to think of\r\nthe woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in, and how I was a\r\nprisoner, locked up with the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in\r\nan uninhabited wilderness, without redemption. In the midst of the\r\ngreatest composures of my mind, this would break out upon me like a\r\nstorm, and make me wring my hands, and weep like a child. Sometimes it\r\nwould take me in the middle of my work, and I would immediately sit\r\ndown and sigh, and look upon the ground for an hour or two together;\r\nand this was still worse to me, for if I could burst out into tears, or\r\nvent myself by words, it would go off, and the grief, having exhausted\r\nitself, would abate.\r\n\r\nBut now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts. I daily read the\r\nWord of God, and applied all the comforts of it to my present state.\r\nOne morning, being very sad, I opened the Bible upon these words,\r\n“I will never, never leave thee, nor forsake thee.” Immediately it\r\noccurred that these words were to me; why else should they be directed\r\nin such a manner, just at the moment when I was mourning over my\r\ncondition, as one forsaken of God and man? “Well, then,” said I, “if\r\nGod does not forsake me, of what ill consequence can it be, or what\r\nmatters it, though the world should all forsake me, seeing on the other\r\nhand if I had all the world, and should lose the favor and blessing of\r\nGod, there would be no comparison in the loss?”\r\n\r\nFrom this moment I began to conclude in my mind that it was possible\r\nfor me to be more happy in this forsaken solitary condition, than it\r\nwas probable I should ever have been in any other particular state in\r\nthe world, and with this thought I was going to give thanks to God for\r\nbringing me to this place.\r\n\r\nI know not what it was, but something shocked my mind at that thought,\r\nand I durst not speak the words. “How canst thou be such a hypocrite,”\r\nsaid I, even audibly, “to pretend to be thankful for a condition which,\r\nhowever thou mayest endeavor to be contented with, thou wouldest rather\r\npray heartily to be delivered from?” So I stopped there; but though\r\nI could not say I thanked God for being there, yet I sincerely gave\r\nthanks to God for opening my eyes, by whatever afflicting providences,\r\nto see the former condition of my life, and to mourn for my wickedness,\r\nand repent. I never opened the Bible, or shut it, but my very soul\r\nwithin me blessed God for directing my friend in England, without any\r\norder of mine, to pack it up among my goods, and for assisting me\r\nafterwards to save it out of the wreck of the ship.\r\n\r\nThus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my third year; and\r\nthough I have not given the reader the trouble of so particular account\r\nof my works this year as the first, yet in general it may be observed,\r\nthat I was very seldom idle, but having regularly divided my time,\r\naccording to the several daily employments that were before me, such\r\nas, first, my duty to God, and the reading the Scriptures, which I\r\nconstantly set apart some time for, thrice every day; secondly, the\r\ngoing abroad with my gun for food, which generally took me up three\r\nhours in every morning, when it did not rain; thirdly, the ordering,\r\ncuring, preserving, and cooking what I had killed or caught for my\r\nsupply; these took up a great part of the day; also, it is to be\r\nconsidered that the middle of the day, when the sun was in the zenith,\r\nthe violence of the heat was too great to stir out; so that about four\r\nhours in the evening was all the time I could be supposed to work in,\r\nwith this exception, that sometimes I changed my hours of hunting and\r\nworking, and went to work in the morning, and abroad with my gun in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nTo this short time allowed for labor, I desire may be added the\r\nexceeding laboriousness of my work; the many hours which, for want of\r\ntools, want of help, and want of skill, everything I did took up out of\r\nmy time. For example, I was full two and forty days making me a board\r\nfor a long shelf, which I wanted in my cave; whereas two sawyers, with\r\ntheir tools and a saw-pit, would have cut six of them out of the same\r\ntree in half a day.\r\n\r\nMy case was this: it was to be a large tree which was to be cut down,\r\nbecause my board was to be a broad one. This tree I was three days\r\na-cutting down, and two more cutting off the boughs, and reducing it\r\nto a log, or piece of timber. With inexpressible hacking and hewing,\r\nI reduced both the sides of it into chips till it begun to be light\r\nenough to move; then I turned it, and made one side of it smooth and\r\nflat as a board from end to end; then turning that side downward, cut\r\nthe other side, till I brought the plank to be about three inches\r\nthick, and smooth on both sides. Any one may judge the labor of my\r\nhands in such a piece of work; but labor and patience carried me\r\nthrough that, and many other things. I only observe this in particular,\r\nto show the reason why so much of my time went away with so little\r\nwork, viz., that what might be a little to be done with help and tools\r\nwas a vast labor and required a prodigious time to do alone, and\r\nby hand. But notwithstanding this, with patience and labor, I went\r\nthrough many things, and, indeed, everything that my circumstances made\r\nnecessary to me to do, as will appear by what follows.\r\n\r\nI was now, in the months of November and December, expecting my crop of\r\nbarley and rice. The ground I had manured or dug up for them was not\r\ngreat; for as I observed, my seed of each was not above the quantity of\r\nhalf a peck; for I had lost one whole crop by sowing in the dry season.\r\nBut now my crop promised very well, when of a sudden I found I was in\r\ndanger of losing it all again by enemies of several sorts, which it was\r\nscarce possible to keep from it; as, first the goats and wild creatures\r\nwhich I called hares, who, tasting the sweetness of the blade, lay in\r\nit night and day, as soon as it came up, and ate it so close, that it\r\ncould get no time to shoot up into stalk.\r\n\r\nThis I saw no remedy for but by making an enclosure about it with a\r\nhedge, which I did with a great deal of toil, and the more, because it\r\nrequired speed. However, as my arable land was but small, suited to\r\nmy crop, I got it totally well fenced in about three weeks’ time, and\r\nshooting some of the creatures in the daytime, I set my dog to guard it\r\nin the night, tying him up to a stake at the gate, where he would stand\r\nand bark all night long; so in a little time the enemies forsook the\r\nplace, and the corn grew very strong and well, and began to ripen apace.\r\n\r\nBut as the beasts ruined me before while my corn was in the blade, so\r\nthe birds were as likely to ruin me now when it was in the ear; for\r\ngoing along by the place to see how it throve, I saw my little crop\r\nsurrounded with fowls, of I know not how many sorts, who stood, as it\r\nwere, watching till I should be gone. I immediately let fly among them,\r\nfor I always had my gun with me. I had no sooner shot, but there rose\r\nup a little cloud of fowls, which I had not seen at all, from among the\r\ncorn itself.\r\n\r\nThis touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days they would\r\ndevour all my hopes, that I should be starved, and never be able to\r\nraise a crop at all, and what to do I could not tell. However, I\r\nresolved not to lose my corn, if possible, though I should watch it\r\nnight and day. In the first place, I went among it to see what damage\r\nwas already done, and found they had spoiled a good deal of it; but\r\nthat as it was yet too green for them, the loss was not so great but\r\nthat the remainder was like to be a good crop if it could be saved.\r\n\r\nI stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I could easily see\r\nthe thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, as if they only waited\r\ntill I was gone away. And the event proved it to be so; for as I walked\r\noff, as if I was gone, I was no sooner out of their sight but they\r\ndropped down, one by one, into the corn again. I was so provoked, that\r\nI could not have patience to stay till more came on, knowing that every\r\ngrain that they ate now was, as it might be said, a peck-loaf to me in\r\nthe consequence; but coming up to the hedge, I fired again, and killed\r\nthree of them. This was what I wished for; so I took them up, and\r\nserved them as we serve notorious thieves in England, viz., hanged them\r\nin chains, for a terror to others. It is impossible to imagine almost\r\nthat this should have such an effect as it had, for the fowls would not\r\nonly not come at the corn, but, in short, they forsook all that part of\r\nthe island, and I could never see a bird near the place as long as my\r\nscarecrows hung there.\r\n\r\nThis I was very glad of, you may be sure; and about the latter end of\r\nDecember, which was our second harvest of the year, I reaped my crop.\r\n\r\nI was sadly put to it for a scythe or a sickle to cut it down, and\r\nall I could do was to make one as well as I could out of one of\r\nthe broadswords, or cutlasses, which I saved among the arms out of\r\nthe ship. However, as my first crop was but small, I had no great\r\ndifficulty to cut it down; in short, I reaped it my way, for I cut\r\nnothing off but the ears, and carried it away in a great basket which\r\nI had made, and so rubbed it out with my hands; and at the end of all\r\nmy harvesting, I found that out of my half peck of seed I had near two\r\nbushels of rice, and above two bushels and a half of barley, that is to\r\nsay, by my guess, for I had no measure at that time.\r\n\r\nHowever, this was a great encouragement to me, and I foresaw that, in\r\ntime, it would please God to supply me with bread. And yet here I was\r\nperplexed again, for I neither knew how to grind or make meal of my\r\ncorn, or indeed how to clean it and part it; nor, if made into meal,\r\nhow to make bread of it, and if how to make it, yet I knew not how\r\nto bake it. These things being added to my desire of having a good\r\nquantity for store, and to secure a constant supply, I resolved not to\r\ntaste any of this crop, but to preserve it all for seed against the\r\nnext season, and, in the meantime, to employ all my study and hours of\r\nworking to accomplish this great work of providing myself with corn and\r\nbread.\r\n\r\nIt might be truly said, that now I worked for my bread. ’Tis a little\r\nwonderful, and what I believe few people have thought much upon, viz.,\r\nthe strange multitude of little things necessary in the providing,\r\nproducing, curing, dressing, making, and finishing this one article of\r\nbread.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_I reaped it my way, for I cut nothing off but the\r\nears, and carried it away in a great basket which I had made_”]\r\n\r\nI, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found this to my daily\r\ndiscouragement, and was made more and more sensible of it every\r\nhour, even after I had got the first handful of seed-corn, which, as I\r\nhave said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed to a surprise.\r\n\r\nFirst, I had no plough to turn up the earth, no spade or shovel to dig\r\nit. Well, this I conquered by making a wooden spade, as I observed\r\nbefore, but this did my work in but a wooden manner; and though it\r\ncost me a great many days to make it, yet, for want of iron, it not\r\nonly wore out the sooner, but made my work the harder, and made it be\r\nperformed much worse.\r\n\r\nHowever, this I bore with, and was content to work it out with\r\npatience, and bear with the badness of the performance. When the corn\r\nwas sowed, I had no harrow, but was forced to go over it myself, and\r\ndrag a great heavy bough of a tree over it, to scratch it, as it may be\r\ncalled, rather than rake or harrow it.\r\n\r\nWhen it was growing and grown, I have observed already how many things\r\nI wanted to fence it, secure it, mow or reap it, cure and carry it\r\nhome, thrash, part it from the chaff, and save it. Then I wanted a\r\nmill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast and salt to make it into\r\nbread, and an oven to bake it, and yet all these things I did without,\r\nas shall be observed; and yet the corn was an inestimable comfort and\r\nadvantage to me too. All this, as I said, made everything laborious and\r\ntedious to me, but that there was no help for; neither was my time so\r\nmuch loss to me, because, as I had divided it, a certain part of it was\r\nevery day appointed to these works, and as I resolved to use none of\r\nthe corn for bread till I had a greater quantity by me, I had the next\r\nsix months to apply myself wholly, by labor and invention, to furnish\r\nmyself with utensils proper for the performing all the operations\r\nnecessary for the making the corn, when I had it, fit for my use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n_His Manufacture of Pottery, and Contrivances for Baking Bread_\r\n\r\n\r\nBut first I was to prepare more land, for I had now seed enough to\r\nsow above an acre of ground. Before I did this, I had a week’s work\r\nat least to make me a spade, which, when it was done, was but a sorry\r\none indeed, and very heavy, and required double labor to work with\r\nit. However, I went through that, and sowed my seed in two large flat\r\npieces of ground, as near my house as I could find them to my mind,\r\nand fenced them in with a good hedge, the stakes of which were all cut\r\nof that wood which I had set before, and knew it would grow; so that\r\nin one year’s time I knew I should have a quick or living hedge, that\r\nwould want but little repair. This work was not so little as to take me\r\nup less than three months, because great part of that time was of the\r\nwet season, when I could not go abroad.\r\n\r\nWithin doors, that is, when it rained, and I could not go out, I found\r\nemployment on the following occasions; always observing, that all the\r\nwhile I was at work, I diverted myself with talking to my parrot, and\r\nteaching him to speak, and I quickly taught him to know his own name,\r\nand at last to speak it out pretty loud, “Poll,” which was the first\r\nword I ever heard spoken in the island by any mouth but my own.\r\n\r\nThis, therefore, was not my work, but an assistant to my work; for\r\nnow, as I said, I had a great employment upon my hands, as follows,\r\nviz., I had long studied, by some means or other to make myself some\r\nearthern vessels, which indeed I wanted sorely, but knew not where to\r\ncome at them. However, considering the heat of the climate, I did not\r\ndoubt but if I could find out any such clay, I might botch up some such\r\npot as might, being dried in the sun, be hard enough and strong enough\r\nto bear handling, and to hold anything that was dry, and required to be\r\nkept so; and as this was necessary in the preparing corn, meal, etc.,\r\nwhich was the thing I was upon, I resolved to make some as large as I\r\ncould, and fit only to stand jars, to hold what should be put into them.\r\n\r\nIt would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to tell how\r\nmany awkward ways I took to raise this paste; what odd, misshapen, ugly\r\nthings I made; how many of them fell in, and how many fell out, the\r\nclay not being stiff enough to bear its own weight; how many cracked by\r\nthe over-violent heat of the sun, being set out too hastily; and how\r\nmany fell in pieces with only removing, as well before as after they\r\nwere dried; and, in a word, how, after having labored hard to find the\r\nclay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring it home, and work it, I could\r\nnot make above two large earthen ugly things (I cannot call them jars)\r\nin about two months’ labor.\r\n\r\nHowever, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I lifted them\r\nvery gently up, and set them down again in two great wicker baskets,\r\nwhich I had made on purpose for them, that they might not break; and\r\nas between the pot and the basket there was a little room to spare, I\r\nstuffed it full of the rice and barley straw, and these two pots being\r\nto stand always dry, I thought would hold my dry corn, and perhaps the\r\nmeal, when the corn was bruised.\r\n\r\nThough I miscarried so much in my design for large pots, yet I made\r\nseveral smaller things with better success; such as little round pots,\r\nflat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and any things my hand turned to;\r\nand the heat of the sun baked them strangely hard. But all this would\r\nnot answer my end, which was to get an earthen pot to hold what was\r\nliquid, and bear the fire, which none of these could do. It happened\r\nafter some time, making a pretty large fire for cooking my meat, when\r\nI went to put it out after I had done with it, I found a broken piece\r\nof one of my earthenware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as a stone,\r\nand red as a tile. I was agreeably surprised to see it, and said to\r\nmyself, that certainly they might be made to burn whole, if they would\r\nburn broken.\r\n\r\nThis set me to studying how to order my fire, so as to make it burn me\r\nsome pots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the potters burn in, or\r\nof glazing them with lead, though I had some lead to do it with; but I\r\nplaced three large pipkins, and two or three pots in a pile, one upon\r\nanother, and placed my firewood all around it, with a great heap of\r\nembers under them. I plied the fire with fresh fuel round the outside,\r\nand upon the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot quite\r\nthrough, and observed that they did not crack at all. When I saw them\r\nclear red, I let them stand in that heart about five or six hours, till\r\nI found one of them, though it did not crack, did melt or run, for the\r\nsand which was mixed with the clay melted by the violence of the heat,\r\nand would have run into glass, if I had gone on; so I slacked my fire\r\ngradually till the pots began to abate of the red color; and watching\r\nthem all night, that I might not let the fire abate too fast, in the\r\nmorning I had three very good, I will not say handsome, pipkins, and\r\ntwo other earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be desired, and one of\r\nthem perfectly glazed with the running of the sand.\r\n\r\nAfter this experiment, I need not say that I wanted no sort of\r\nearthenware for my use; but I must needs say, as to the shapes of them,\r\nthey were very indifferent, as any one may suppose, when I had no way\r\nof making them but as the children make dirt pies, or as a woman would\r\nmake pies that never learned to raise paste.\r\n\r\nNo joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to mine, when\r\nI found I had made an earthen pot that would bear fire; and I had\r\nhardly patience to stay till they were cold, before I set one on the\r\nfire again, with some water in it, to boil me some meat, which it did\r\nadmirably well; and with a piece of a kid I made some very good broth,\r\nthough I wanted oatmeal and several other ingredients requisite to make\r\nit so good as I would have had it been.\r\n\r\nMy next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp or beat some\r\ncorn in; for as to the mill, there was no thought of arriving to that\r\nperfection of art with one pair of hands. To supply this want I was\r\nat a great loss; for, of all trades in the world, I was as perfectly\r\nunqualified for a stone-cutter as for any whatever; neither had I any\r\ntools to go about it with. I spent many a day to find out a great stone\r\nbig enough to cut hollow, and make it fit for a mortar, and could find\r\nnone at all, except what was in the solid rock, and which I had no way\r\nto dig or cut out; nor indeed were the rocks in the island of hardness\r\nsufficient, but were all of a sandy crumbling stone, which neither\r\nwould bear the weight of a heavy pestle or would break the corn without\r\nfilling it with sand. So, after a great deal of time lost in searching\r\nfor a stone, I gave it over, and resolved to look about for a great\r\nblock of hard wood, which I found indeed much easier; and getting one\r\nas big as I had strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it in the\r\noutside with my axe and hatchet, and then, with the help of fire, and\r\ninfinite labor, made a hollow place in it, as the Indians in Brazil\r\nmake their canoes. After this, I made a great heavy pestle or beater,\r\nof the wood called the iron-wood; and this I prepared and laid by\r\nagainst I had my next crop of corn, when I proposed to myself to grind,\r\nor rather pound, my corn into meal, to make my bread.\r\n\r\nMy next difficulty was to make a sieve, or search, to dress my meal,\r\nand to part it from the bran and the husk, without which I did not see\r\nit possible I could have any bread. This was a most difficult thing,\r\nso much as but to think on, for to be sure I had nothing like the\r\nnecessary thing to make it; I mean fine thin canvas or stuff, to search\r\nthe meal through.\r\n\r\nAnd here I was at a full stop for many months, nor did I really know\r\nwhat to do; linen I had none left, but what was mere rags; I had\r\ngoat’s hair, but neither knew I how to weave it nor spin it; and had I\r\nknown how, there were no tools to work it with. All the remedy I found\r\nfor this was, that at last I did remember I had, among the seamen’s\r\nclothes which were saved out of the ship, some neckcloths of calico or\r\nmuslin; and with some pieces of these I made three small sieves, but\r\nproper enough for the work; and thus I made shift for some years. How I\r\ndid afterwards, I shall show in its place.\r\n\r\nThe baking part was the next thing to be considered, and how I should\r\nmake bread when I came to have corn; for, first, I had no yeast. As to\r\nthat part, as there was no supplying the want, so I did not concern\r\nmyself much about it; but for an oven I was indeed in great pain. At\r\nlength I found out an experiment for that also, which was this: I made\r\nsome earthen vessels very broad, but not deep, that is to say, about\r\ntwo feet diameter, and not above nine inches deep; these I burned in\r\nthe fire, as I had done the other, and laid them by; and when I wanted\r\nto bake, I made a great fire upon my hearth, which I had paved with\r\nsome square tiles, of my own making and burning also; but I should not\r\ncall them square.\r\n\r\nWhen the firewood was burned pretty much into embers, or live coals,\r\nI drew them forward upon this hearth, so as to cover it all over, and\r\nthere I let them lie till the hearth was very hot; then sweeping away\r\nall the embers, I set down my loaf, or loaves, and whelming down the\r\nearthen pot upon them, drew the embers all round the outside of the\r\npot, to keep in and add to the heat. And thus, as well as in the best\r\noven in the world, I baked my barley-loaves, and became, in little\r\ntime, a mere pastry-cook into the bargain; for I made myself several\r\ncakes of the rice, and puddings; indeed I made no pies, neither had\r\nI anything to put into them, supposing I had, except flesh either of\r\nfowls or goats.\r\n\r\nIt need not be wondered at, if all these things took me up most part of\r\nthe third year of my abode here; for it is to be observed, that in the\r\nintervals of these things I had my new harvest and husbandry to manage;\r\nfor I reaped my corn in its season, and carried it home as well as I\r\ncould, and laid it up in the ear, in my large baskets, till I had time\r\nto rub it out, for I had no floor to thrash it on, or instrument to\r\nthrash it with.\r\n\r\nAnd now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I really wanted to build\r\nmy barns bigger. I wanted a place to lay it up in, for the increase of\r\nthe corn now yielded me so much, that I had of the barley about twenty\r\nbushels, and of the rice as much, or more, insomuch that now I resolved\r\nto begin to use it freely; for my bread had been quite gone a great\r\nwhile; also, I resolved to see what quantity would be sufficient for me\r\na whole year, and to sow but once a year.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley and rice was\r\nmuch more than I could consume in a year; so I resolved to sow just the\r\nsame quantity every year that I sowed the last, in hopes that such a\r\nquantity would fully provide me with bread, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n_Meditates His Escape from the Island--Builds a Canoe--Failure of His\r\nScheme and Resignation to His Condition--He Makes Himself a New Dress_\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the while these things were doing, you may be sure my thoughts ran\r\nmany times upon the prospect of land which I had seen from the other\r\nside of the island, and I was not without secret wishes that I were\r\non shore there, fancying the seeing the mainland, and in an inhabited\r\ncountry, I might find some way or other to convey myself farther, and\r\nperhaps at last find some means of escape.\r\n\r\nBut all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of such a\r\ncondition, and how I might fall into the hands of savages, and perhaps\r\nsuch as I might have reason to think far worse than the lions and\r\ntigers of Africa; that if I once came into their power, I should run\r\na hazard more than a thousand to one of being killed, and perhaps of\r\nbeing eaten; for I had heard that the people of the Caribbean coasts\r\nwere cannibals, or man-eaters, and I knew by the latitude that I could\r\nnot be far off from that shore. Suppose they were not cannibals, yet\r\nthat they might kill me, as many Europeans who had fallen into their\r\nhands had been served, even when they had been ten or twenty together,\r\nmuch more I, that was but one, and could make little or no defence; all\r\nthese things, I say, which I ought to have considered well of, and did\r\ncast up in my thoughts afterwards, yet took up none of my apprehensions\r\nat first, but my head ran mightily upon the thought of getting over to\r\nthe shore.\r\n\r\nNow I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with the\r\nshoulder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed above a thousand miles on\r\nthe coast of Africa; but this was in vain. Then I thought I would go\r\nand look at our ship’s boat, which, as I have said, was blown up upon\r\nthe shore a great way, in the storm, when we were first cast away. She\r\nlay almost where she did at first, but not quite; and was turned, by\r\nthe force of the waves and the winds, almost bottom upward, against a\r\nhigh ridge of beachy rough sand, but no water about her, as before.\r\n\r\nIf I had had hands to have refitted her, and to have launched her into\r\nthe water, the boat would have done well enough, and I might have gone\r\nback into the Brazils with her easily enough; but I might have foreseen\r\nthat I could no more turn her and set her upright upon her bottom, than\r\nI could remove the island. However, I went to the woods, and cut levers\r\nand rollers, and brought them to the boat, resolved to try what I could\r\ndo; suggesting to myself that if I could but turn her down, I might\r\neasily repair the damage she had received, and she would be a very good\r\nboat, and I might go to sea in her very easily.\r\n\r\nI spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil, and spent,\r\nI think, three or four weeks about it. At last finding it impossible to\r\nheave it up with my little strength, I fell to digging away the sand,\r\nto undermine it, and so to make it fall down, setting pieces of wood\r\nto thrust and guide it right in the fall. But when I had done this, I\r\nwas unable to stir it up again, or to get under it, much less to move\r\nit forward towards the water; so I was forced to give it over. And yet,\r\nthough I gave over the hopes of the boat, my desire to venture over for\r\nthe main increased, rather than decreased, as the means for it seemed\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThis at length put me upon thinking whether it was not possible to make\r\nmyself a canoe, or _periagua_, such as the natives of those climates\r\nmake, even without tools, or, as I might say, without hands, viz.,\r\nof the trunk of a great tree. This I not only thought possible, but\r\neasy, and pleased myself extremely with the thoughts of making it, and\r\nwith my having much more convenience for it than any of the negroes or\r\nIndians; but not at all considering the particular inconveniences which\r\nI lay under more than the Indians did, viz., want of hands to move it,\r\nwhen it was made, into the water, a difficulty much harder for me to\r\nsurmount than all the consequences of want of tools could be to them.\r\nFor what was it to me, that when I had chosen a vast tree in the woods,\r\nI might with much trouble cut it down, if, after I might be able with\r\nmy tools to hew and dub the outside into the proper shape of a boat,\r\nand burn or cut out the inside to make it hollow, so to make a boat of\r\nit; if, after all this, I must leave it just there where I found it,\r\nand was not able to launch it into the water?\r\n\r\nOne would have thought I could not have had the least reflection upon\r\nmy mind of my circumstance while I was making this boat, but I should\r\nhave immediately thought how I should get it into the sea; but my\r\nthoughts were so intent upon my voyage over the sea in it, that I never\r\nonce considered how I should get it off of the land; and it was really,\r\nin its own nature, more easy for me to guide it over forty-five miles\r\nof sea, than about forty-five fathoms of land, where it lay, to set it\r\nafloat in the water.\r\n\r\nI went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever man did\r\nwho had any of his senses awake. I pleased myself with the design,\r\nwithout determining whether I was ever able to undertake it. Not but\r\nthat the difficulty of launching my boat came often into my head; but I\r\nput a stop to my own inquiries into it, by this foolish answer which I\r\ngave myself, “Let’s first make it! I’ll warrant I’ll find some way or\r\nother to get it along when ’tis done.”\r\n\r\nThis was a most preposterous method; but the eagerness of my fancy\r\nprevailed, and to work I went. I felled a cedar tree: I question much\r\nwhether Solomon ever had such a one for the building of the Temple\r\nof Jerusalem. It was five feet ten inches diameter at the lower part\r\nnext the stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter at the end of\r\ntwenty-two feet, after which it lessened for awhile, and then parted\r\ninto branches. It was not without infinite labor that I felled this\r\ntree. I was twenty days hacking and hewing at it at the bottom; I was\r\nfourteen more getting the branches and limbs, and the vast spreading\r\nhead of it cut off, which I hacked and hewed through with axe and\r\nhatchet, and inexpressible labor. After this, it cost me a month to\r\nshape it and dub it to a proportion, and to something like the bottom\r\nof a boat, that it might swim upright as it ought to do. It cost me\r\nnear three months more to clear the inside, and work it so as to make\r\nan exact boat of it. This I did, indeed, without fire, by mere mallet\r\nand chisel, and by the dint of hard labor, till I had brought it to\r\nbe a very handsome _periagua_ and big enough to have carried six and\r\ntwenty men, and consequently big enough to have carried me all my cargo.\r\n\r\nWhen I had gone through this work, I was extremely delighted with it.\r\nThe boat was really much bigger than I ever saw a canoe or _periagua_,\r\nthat was made of one tree, in my life. Many a weary stroke it had\r\ncost, you may be sure; and there remained nothing but to get it into\r\nthe water; and had I gotten it into the water, I made no question but\r\nI should have begun the maddest voyage, and the most unlikely to be\r\nperformed, that ever was undertaken.\r\n\r\nBut all my devices to get it into the water failed me, though they cost\r\nme infinite labor too. It lay about one hundred yards from the water,\r\nand not more; but the first inconvenience was, it was uphill towards\r\nthe creek. Well, to take away this discouragement, I resolved to dig\r\ninto the surface of the earth, and so make a declivity. This I began,\r\nand it cost me a prodigious deal of pains; but who grudges pains, that\r\nhave their deliverance in view? But when this was worked through, and\r\nthis difficulty managed, it was still much at one, for I could no more\r\nstir the canoe than I could the other boat.\r\n\r\nThen I measured the distance of ground, and resolved to cut a dock or\r\ncanal, to bring the water up to the canoe, seeing I could not bring the\r\ncanoe down to the water. Well, I began this work; and when I began to\r\nenter into it, and calculate how deep it was to be dug, how broad, how\r\nthe stuff to be thrown out, I found that by the number of hands I had,\r\nbeing none but my own, it must have been ten or twelve years before\r\nI should have gone through with it; for the shore lay high, so that\r\nat the upper end it must have been at least twenty feet deep; so at\r\nlength, though with great reluctancy, I gave this attempt over also.\r\n\r\nThis grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too late, the folly of\r\nbeginning a work before we count the cost, and before we judge rightly\r\nof our own strength to go through with it.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of this work I finished my fourth year in this place, and\r\nkept my anniversary with the same devotion, and with as much comfort as\r\never before; for, by a constant study and serious application of the\r\nWord of God, and by the assistance of His grace, I gained a different\r\nknowledge from what I had before. I entertained different notions of\r\nthings. I looked now upon the world as a thing remote, which I had\r\nnothing to do with, no expectation from, and, indeed, no desires about.\r\nIn a word, I had nothing indeed to do with it, nor was ever like to\r\nhave; so I thought it looked, as we may perhaps look upon it hereafter,\r\nviz., as a place I had lived in, but was come out of it; and well might\r\nI say, as father Abraham to Dives, “Between me and thee is a great gulf\r\nfixed.”\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I was removed from all the wickedness of the\r\nworld here. I had neither the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye,\r\nor the pride of life. I had nothing to covet, for I had all that I\r\nwas now capable of enjoying. I was lord of the whole manor; or, if I\r\npleased, I might call myself king or emperor over the whole country\r\nwhich I had possession of. There were no rivals: I had no competitor,\r\nnone to dispute sovereignty or command with me. I might have raised\r\nship-loadings of corn, but I had no use for it; so I let as little\r\ngrow as I thought enough for my occasion. I had tortoise or turtles\r\nenough, but now and then one was as much as I could put to any use. I\r\nhad timber enough to have built a fleet of ships. I had grapes enough\r\nto have made wine, or to have cured into raisins, to have loaded that\r\nfleet when they had been built.\r\n\r\nBut all I could make use of was all that was valuable. I had enough\r\nto eat and to supply my wants, and what was all the rest to me? If I\r\nkilled more flesh than I could eat, the dog must eat it, or the vermin.\r\nIf I sowed more corn than I could eat, it must be spoiled. The trees\r\nthat I cut down were lying to rot on the ground; I could make no more\r\nuse of them than for fuel, and that I had no occasion for but to dress\r\nmy food.\r\n\r\nIn a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to me, upon\r\njust reflection, that all the good things of this world are no farther\r\ngood to us than they are for our use; and that whatever we may heap\r\nup indeed to give others, we enjoy just as much as we can use, and no\r\nmore. The most covetous, gripping miser in the world would have been\r\ncured of the vice of covetousness, if he had been in my case; for I\r\npossessed infinitely more than I knew what to do with. I had no room\r\nfor desire, except it was of things which I had not, and they were\r\nbut trifles, though indeed of great use to me. I had, as I hinted\r\nbefore, a parcel of money, as well gold as silver, about thirty-six\r\npounds sterling. Alas! there the nasty, sorry, useless stuff lay; I\r\nhad no manner of business for it; and I often thought with myself,\r\nthat I would have given a handful of it for a gross of tobacco-pipes,\r\nor for a hand-mill to grind my corn; nay, I would have given it all\r\nfor six-pennyworth of turnip and carrot seed out of England, or for a\r\nhandful of peas and beans, and a bottle of ink. As it was, I had not\r\nthe least advantage by it, or benefit from it; but there it lay in a\r\ndrawer, and grew moldy with the damp of the cave in the wet season; and\r\nif I had had the drawer full of diamonds, it had been the same case,\r\nand they had been of no manner of value to me because of no use.\r\n\r\nI had now brought my state of life to be much easier in itself than\r\nit was at first, and much easier to my mind, as well as to my body. I\r\nfrequently sat down to my meat with thankfulness, and admired the hand\r\nof God’s providence, which had thus spread my table in the wilderness.\r\nI learned to look more upon the bright side of my condition, and less\r\nupon the dark side, and to consider what I enjoyed, rather than what\r\nI wanted; and this gave me sometimes such secret comforts, that I\r\ncannot express them; and which I take notice of here, to put those\r\ndiscontented people in mind of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what\r\nGod has given them, because they see and covet something that He has\r\nnot given them. All our discontents about what we want, appeared to me\r\nto spring from the want of thankfulness for what we have.\r\n\r\nAnother reflection was of great use to me, and doubtless would be so to\r\nany one that should fall into such distress as mine was; and this was,\r\nto compare my present condition with what I at first expected it should\r\nbe; nay, with what it would certainly have been, if the good providence\r\nof God had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up nearer to the\r\nshore, where I not only could come at her, but could bring what I got\r\nout of her to the shore, for my relief and comfort; without which I had\r\nwanted for tools to work, weapons for defence, or gunpowder and shot\r\nfor getting my food.\r\n\r\nI spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in representing to myself,\r\nin the most lively colors, how I must have acted if I had got nothing\r\nout of the ship. How I could not have so much as got any food, except\r\nfish and turtles; and that as it was long before I found any of them,\r\nI must have perished first; that I should have lived, if I had not\r\nperished, like a mere savage; that if I had killed a goat or a fowl, by\r\nany contrivance, I had no way to flay or open them, or part the flesh\r\nfrom the skin and the bowels, or to cut it up; but must gnaw it with my\r\nteeth, and pull it with my claws, like a beast.\r\n\r\nThese reflections made me very sensible of the goodness of Providence\r\nto me, and very thankful for my present condition, with all its\r\nhardships and misfortunes; and this part also I cannot but recommend\r\nto the reflection of those who are apt, in their misery, to say, Is\r\nany affliction like mine? Let them consider how much worse the cases\r\nof some people are, and their case might have been, if Providence had\r\nthought fit.\r\n\r\nI had another reflection, which assisted me also to comfort my mind\r\nwith hopes; and this was, comparing my present condition with what\r\nI had deserved, and had therefore reason to expect from the hand of\r\nProvidence. I had lived a dreadful life, perfectly destitute of the\r\nknowledge and fear of God. I had been well instructed by father and\r\nmother; neither had they been wanting to me in their early endeavors\r\nto infuse a religious awe of God into my mind, a sense of my duty,\r\nand of what the nature and end of my being required of me. But alas!\r\nfalling early into the seafaring life, which, of all the lives, is the\r\nmost destitute of the fear of God, though His terrors are always before\r\nthem; I say, falling early into the seafaring life, and into seafaring\r\ncompany, all that little sense of religion which I had entertained was\r\nlaughed out of me by my messmates; by a hardened despising of dangers,\r\nand the views of death, which grew habitual to me; by my long absence\r\nfrom all manner of opportunities to converse with anything but what was\r\nlike myself, or to hear anything that was good, or tended towards it.\r\n\r\nSo void was I of everything that was good, or of the least sense of\r\nwhat I was, or was to be, that in the greatest deliverances I enjoyed,\r\nsuch as my escape from Sallee; my being taken up by the Portuguese\r\nmaster of the ship; my being planted so well in the Brazils; my\r\nreceiving the cargo from England, and the like; I never had once the\r\nwords, “Thank God,” as much as on my mind, or in my mouth; nor in the\r\ngreatest distress had I so much as a thought to pray to Him, or so much\r\nas to say, “Lord, have mercy upon me!” no, nor to mention the name of\r\nGod, unless it was to swear by and blaspheme it.\r\n\r\nI had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months, as I have\r\nalready observed, on the account of my wicked and hardened life past;\r\nand when I looked about me, and considered what particular providences\r\nhad attended me since my coming into this place, and how God had dealt\r\nbountifully with me, had not only punished me less than my iniquity had\r\ndeserved, but had so plentifully provided for me; this gave me great\r\nhopes that my repentance was accepted, and that God had yet mercy in\r\nstore for me.\r\n\r\nWith these reflections, I worked my mind up, not only to resignation\r\nto the will of God in the present disposition of my circumstances,\r\nbut even to a sincere thankfulness for my condition; and that I, who\r\nwas yet a living man, ought not to complain, seeing I had not the due\r\npunishment of my sins; that I enjoyed so many mercies, which I had\r\nno reason to have expected in that place; that I ought never more to\r\nrepine at my condition, but to rejoice, and to give daily thanks for\r\nthat daily bread, which nothing but a crowd of wonders could have\r\nbrought; that I ought to consider I had been fed even by miracle, even\r\nas great as that of feeding Elijah by ravens; nay, by a long series of\r\nmiracles; and that I could hardly have named a place in the unhabitable\r\npart of the world where I could have been cast more to my advantage; a\r\nplace where, as I had no society, which was my affliction on one hand,\r\nso I found no ravenous beasts, no furious wolves or tigers, to threaten\r\nmy life; no venomous creatures or poisonous, which I might feed on to\r\nmy hurt; no savages to murder and devour me.\r\n\r\nIn a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one way, so it was a life\r\nof mercy another; and I wanted nothing to make it a life of comfort,\r\nbut to be able to make my sense of God’s goodness to me, and care over\r\nme in this condition, be my daily consolation; and after I did make a\r\njust improvement of these things, I went away, and was no more sad.\r\n\r\nI had now been here so long, that many things which I brought on shore\r\nfor my help were either quite gone, or very much wasted, and near\r\nspent. My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some time, all but a\r\nvery little, which I eked out with water, a little and a little, till\r\nit was so pale it scarce left any appearance of black upon the paper.\r\nAs long as it lasted, I made use of it to minute down the days of the\r\nmonth on which any remarkable thing happened to me. And, first, by\r\ncasting up times past, I remember that there was a strange concurrence\r\nof days in the various providences which befell me, and which, if I had\r\nbeen superstitiously inclined to observe days as fatal or fortunate,\r\nI might have had reason to have looked upon with a great deal of\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nFirst, I had observed that the same day that I broke away from my\r\nfather and my friends, and run away to Hull, in order to go to sea, the\r\nsame day afterwards I was taken by the Sallee man-of-war, and made a\r\nslave.\r\n\r\nThe same day of the year that I escaped out of the wreck of that ship\r\nin Yarmouth Roads, that same day-year afterwards I made my escape from\r\nSallee in the boat.\r\n\r\nThe same day of the year I was born on, viz., the 30th of September,\r\nthat same day I had my life so miraculously saved twenty-six years\r\nafter, when I was cast on shore in this island; so that my wicked life\r\nand my solitary life began both on a day.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to my ink’s being wasted, was that of my bread; I mean\r\nthe biscuit, which I brought out of the ship. This I had husbanded to\r\nthe last degree, allowing myself but one cake of bread a day for above\r\na year; and yet I was quite without bread for near a year before I got\r\nany corn of my own; and great reason I had to be thankful that I had\r\nany at all, the getting it being, as has been already observed, next to\r\nmiraculous.\r\n\r\nMy clothes began to decay, too, mightily. As to linen, I had none a\r\ngood while, except some checkered shirts which I found in the chests of\r\nthe other seamen, and which I carefully preserved, because many times\r\nI could bear no other clothes on but a shirt; and it was a very great\r\nhelp to me that I had, among all the men’s clothes of the ship, almost\r\nthree dozen of shirts. There were also several thick watch-coats of the\r\nseamen’s which were left indeed, but they were too hot to wear; and\r\nthough it is true that the weather was so violent hot that there was no\r\nneed of clothes, yet I could not go quite naked, no, though I had been\r\ninclined to it, which I was not, nor could abide the thoughts of it,\r\nthough I was all alone.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I could not go quite naked was, I could not bear the\r\nheat of the sun so well when quite naked as with some clothes on; nay,\r\nthe very heat frequently blistered my skin; whereas, with a shirt on,\r\nthe air itself made some motion, and whistling under that shirt, was\r\ntwofold cooler than without it. No more could I ever bring myself to go\r\nout in the heat of the sun without a cap or hat. The heat of the sun\r\nbeating with such violence, as it does in that place, would give me the\r\nheadache presently, by darting so directly on my head, without a cap or\r\nhat on, so that I could not bear it; whereas, if I put on my hat, it\r\nwould presently go away.\r\n\r\nUpon those views, I began to consider about putting the few rags I\r\nhad, which I called clothes, into some order. I had worn out all the\r\nwaistcoats I had, and my business was now to try if I could not make\r\njackets out of the great watch-coats which I had by me, and with such\r\nother materials as I had; so I set to work a-tailoring, or rather,\r\nindeed, a-botching, for I made most piteous work of it. However, I made\r\nshift to make me two or three new waistcoats, which I hoped would serve\r\nme a great while. As for breeches or drawers, I made but a very sorry\r\nshift indeed till afterward.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the creatures that I\r\nkilled, I mean four-footed ones, and I had hung them up stretched\r\nout with sticks in the sun, by which means some of them were so dry\r\nand hard that they were fit for little, but others it seems were\r\nvery useful. The first thing I made of these was a great cap for my\r\nhead, with the hair on the outside, to shoot off the rain; and this I\r\nperformed so well, that after this I made me a suit of clothes wholly\r\nof these skins, that is to say, a waistcoat, and breeches open at\r\nknees, and both loose, for they were rather wanting to keep me cool\r\nthan to keep me warm. I must not omit to acknowledge that they were\r\nwretchedly made; for if I was a bad carpenter, I was a worse tailor.\r\nHowever, they were such as I made very good shift with; and when I was\r\nabroad, if it happened to rain, the hair of my waistcoat and cap being\r\noutermost, I was kept very dry.\r\n\r\nAfter this I spent a great deal of time and pains to make me an\r\numbrella. I was indeed in great want of one, and had a great mind to\r\nmake one. I had seen them made in the Brazils, where they are very\r\nuseful in the great heats which are there; and I felt the heats every\r\njot as great here, and greater too, being nearer the equinox. Besides,\r\nas I was obliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful thing to me,\r\nas well for the rains as the heats. I took a world of pains at it, and\r\nwas a great while before I could make anything likely to hold; nay,\r\nafter I thought I had hit the way, I spoiled two or three before I made\r\none to my mind; but at last I made one that answered indifferently\r\nwell. The main difficulty I found was to make it to let down. I could\r\nmake it to spread; but if it did not let down too, and draw in, it was\r\nnot portable for me any way but just over my head, which would not\r\ndo. However, at last, as I said, I made one to answer, and covered\r\nit with skins, the hair upwards, so that it cast off the rains like\r\na pent-house, and kept off the sun so effectually, that I would walk\r\nout in the hottest of the weather with greater advantage than I could\r\nbefore in the coolest; and when I had no need of it, could close it,\r\nand carry it under my arm.\r\n\r\nThus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entirely composed by\r\nresigning to the will of God, and throwing myself wholly upon the\r\ndisposal of His providence. This made my life better than sociable; for\r\nwhen I began to regret the want of conversation, I would ask myself\r\nwhether thus conversing mutually with my own thoughts and, as I hope\r\nI may say, with even God Himself, by ejaculations, was not better than\r\nthe utmost enjoyment of human society in the world?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n_He Makes a Smaller Canoe in which He Attempts to Cruise Round the\r\nIsland--His Perilous Situation at Sea--He Returns Home_\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot say that after this, for five years, any extraordinary thing\r\nhappened to me; but I lived on in the same course, in the same posture\r\nand place, just as before. The chief things I was employed in, besides\r\nmy yearly labor of planting my barley and rice, and curing my raisins,\r\nof both which I always kept up just enough to have sufficient stock of\r\none year’s provisions beforehand--and my daily labor of going out with\r\nmy gun, I had one labor, to make me a canoe, which at last I finished;\r\nso that by digging a canal to it of six feet wide, and four feet deep,\r\nI brought it into the creek, almost half a mile. As for the first,\r\nwhich was so vastly big, as I made it without considering beforehand,\r\nas I ought to do, how I should be able to launch it; so, never being\r\nable to bring it to the water, or bring the water to it, I was obliged\r\nto let it lie where it was, as a memorandum to teach me to be wiser\r\nnext time. Indeed, the next time, though I could not get a tree proper\r\nfor it, and in a place where I could not get the water to it at any\r\nless distance than, as I have said, near half a mile, yet as I saw it\r\nwas practicable at last, I never gave it over; and though I was near\r\ntwo years about it, yet I never grudged my labor, in hopes of having a\r\nboat to go off to sea at last.\r\n\r\nHowever, though my little _periagua_ was finished, yet the size of it\r\nwas not at all answerable to the design which I had in view when I made\r\nthe first; I mean, of venturing over to the _terra firma_, where it was\r\nabove forty miles broad. Accordingly, the smallness of my boat assisted\r\nto put an end to that design, and now I thought no more of it. But as I\r\nhad a boat, my next design was to make a tour round the island; for as\r\nI had been on the other side in one place, crossing, as I have already\r\ndescribed it, over the land, so the discoveries I made in that little\r\njourney made me very eager to see other parts of the coast; and now I\r\nhad a boat, I thought of nothing but sailing round the island.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, that I might do everything with discretion and\r\nconsideration, I fitted up a little mast to my boat, and made a sail to\r\nit out of some of the piece of the ship’s sail, which lay in store, and\r\nof which I had a great stock by me.\r\n\r\nHaving fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat, I found she would\r\nsail very well. Then I made little lockers, or boxes, at either end of\r\nmy boat, to put provisions, necessaries, and ammunition, etc., into,\r\nto be kept dry, either from rain or the spray of the sea; and a little\r\nlong hollow place I cut in the inside of the boat, where I could lay my\r\ngun, making a flap to hang down over it to keep it dry.\r\n\r\nI fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, like a mast, to stand\r\nover my head, and keep the heat of the sun off of me, like an awning;\r\nand thus I every now and then took a little voyage upon the sea, but\r\nnever went far out, nor far from the little creek. But at last, being\r\neager to view the circumference of my little kingdom, I resolved upon\r\nmy tour; and accordingly I victualled my ship for the voyage, putting\r\nin two dozen of my loaves (cakes I should rather call them) of barley\r\nbread, an earthen pot full of parched rice, a food I ate a great deal\r\nof, a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder and shot for\r\nkilling more, and two large watch-coats, of those which, as I mentioned\r\nbefore, I had saved out of the seamen’s chests; these I took, one to\r\nlie upon, and the other to cover me in the night.\r\n\r\nIt was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of my reign, or my\r\ncaptivity, which you please, that I set out on this voyage, and I found\r\nit much longer than I expected; for though the island itself was not\r\nvery large, yet when I came to the east side of it I found a great\r\nledge of rocks lie out about two leagues into the sea, some above\r\nwater, some under it, and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry half\r\na league more; so that I was obliged to go a great way out to sea to\r\ndouble the point.\r\n\r\nWhen first I discovered them, I was going to give over my enterprise,\r\nand come back again, not knowing how far it might oblige me to go out\r\nto sea, and, above all, doubting how I should get back again, so I came\r\nto an anchor; for I had made me a kind of anchor with a piece of a\r\nbroken grappling which I got out of the ship.\r\n\r\nHaving secured my boat, I took my gun and went on shore, climbing up\r\nupon a hill, which seemed to overlook that point, where I saw the full\r\nextent of it, and resolved to venture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_--and thus I every now and then took a little voyage\r\nupon the sea_”]\r\n\r\nIn my viewing the sea from that hill, where I stood, I perceived a\r\nstrong, and indeed a most furious current, which ran to the east,\r\nand even came close to the point; and I took the more notice of it,\r\nbecause I saw there might be some danger that when I came into it I\r\nmight be carried out to sea by the strength of it, and not be able to\r\nmake the island again. And indeed, had I not gotten first up upon this\r\nhill, I believe it would have been so; for there was the same current\r\non the other side of the island, only that it set off at a farther\r\ndistance; and I saw there was a strong eddy under the shore; so I had\r\nnothing to do but to get in out of the first current, and I should\r\npresently be in an eddy.\r\n\r\nI lay here, however, two days; because the wind, blowing pretty fresh\r\nat E.S.E., and that being just contrary to the said current, made a\r\ngreat breach of the sea upon the point; so that it was not safe for me\r\nto keep too close to the shore for the breach, nor to go too far off\r\nbecause of the stream.\r\n\r\nThe third day, in the morning, the wind having abated overnight, the\r\nsea was calm, and I ventured. But I am a warning-piece again to all\r\nrash and ignorant pilots; for no sooner was I come to the point, when\r\neven I was not my boat’s length from the shore, but I found myself in\r\na great depth of water, and a current like the sluice of a mill. It\r\ncarried my boat along with it with such violence, that all I could\r\ndo could not keep her so much as on the edge of it, but I found it\r\nhurried me farther and farther out from the eddy, which was on my left\r\nhand. There was no wind stirring to help me, and all I could do with\r\nmy paddlers signified nothing. And now I began to give myself over for\r\nlost; for, as the current was on both sides the island, I knew in a few\r\nleagues’ distance they must join again, and then I was irrevocably\r\ngone. Nor did I see any possibility of avoiding it; so that I had no\r\nprospect before me but of perishing; not by the sea, for that was calm\r\nenough, but of starving for hunger. I had indeed found a tortoise on\r\nthe shore, as big almost as I could lift, and had tossed it into the\r\nboat; and I had a great jar of fresh water, that is to say, one of\r\nmy earthen pots; but what was all this to being driven into the vast\r\nocean, where, to be sure, there was no shore, no mainland or island,\r\nfor a thousand leagues at least.\r\n\r\nAnd now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God to make the\r\nmost miserable condition mankind could be in worse. Now I looked\r\nback upon my desolate solitary island as the most pleasant place in\r\nthe world, and all the happiness my heart could wish for was to be\r\nbut there again. I stretched out my hands to it, with eager wishes.\r\n“O happy desert!” said I, “I shall never see thee more. O miserable\r\ncreature,” said I, “whither am I going?” Then I reproached myself with\r\nmy unthankful temper, and how I had repined at my solitary condition;\r\nand now what would I give to be on shore there again. Thus we never see\r\nthe true state of our condition till it is illustrated to us by its\r\ncontraries; nor know how to value what we enjoy, but by the want of it.\r\nIt is scarce possible to imagine the consternation I was now in, being\r\ndriven from my beloved island (for so it appeared to me now to be) into\r\nthe wide ocean, almost two leagues, and in the utmost despair of ever\r\nrecovering it again. However, I worked hard, till indeed my strength\r\nwas almost exhausted, and kept my boat as much to the northward, that\r\nis, towards the side of the current which the eddy lay on, as possibly\r\nI could; when about noon, as the sun passed the meridian, I thought I\r\nfelt a little breeze of wind in my face, springing up from the S.S.E.\r\nThis cheered my heart a little, and especially when, in about half\r\nan hour more, it blew a pretty small gentle gale. By this time I was\r\ngotten at a frightful distance from the island; and had the least\r\ncloud or hazy weather intervened, I had been undone another way too;\r\nfor I had no compass on board, and should never have known how to have\r\nsteered towards the island if I had but once lost sight of it. But the\r\nweather continuing clear, I applied myself to get up my mast again, and\r\nspread my sail, standing away to the north as much as possible, to get\r\nout of the current.\r\n\r\nJust as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to stretch away,\r\nI saw even by the clearness of the water some alteration of the current\r\nwas near; for where the current was so strong, the water was foul. But\r\nperceiving the water clear, I found the current abate, and presently I\r\nfound to the east, at about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some\r\nrocks. These rocks I found caused the current to part again; and as the\r\nmain stress of it ran away more southerly, leaving the rocks to the\r\nnorth-east, so the other returned by the repulse of the rocks, and made\r\na strong eddy, which ran back again to the north-west with a very sharp\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nThey who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them upon the\r\nladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going to murder them, or\r\nwho have been in such like extremities, may guess what my present\r\nsurprise of joy was, and how gladly I put my boat into the stream of\r\nthis eddy; and the wind also freshening, how gladly I spread my sail to\r\nit, running cheerfully before the wind, and with a strong tide or eddy\r\nunder foot.\r\n\r\nThis eddy carried me about a league in my way back again, directly\r\ntowards the island, but about two leagues more to the northward than\r\nthe current which carried me away at first; so that when I came near\r\nthe island, I found myself open to the northern shore of it, that is\r\nto say, the outer end of the island, opposite to that which I went out\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\nWhen I had made something more than a league of way by the help of\r\nthis current or eddy, I found it was spent, and served me no farther.\r\nHowever, I found that being between the two great currents, viz., that\r\non the south side, which had hurried me away, and that on the north,\r\nwhich lay about a league on the other side; I say, between these two,\r\nin the wake of the island, I found the water at least still, and\r\nrunning no way; and having still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept\r\non steering directly for the island, though not making such fresh way\r\nas I did before.\r\n\r\nAbout four o’clock in the evening, being then within about a league\r\nof the island, I found the point of the rocks which occasioned this\r\ndisaster stretching out, as is described before, to the southward, and\r\ncasting off the current more southwardly had, of course, made another\r\neddy to the north, and this I found very strong, but not directly\r\nsetting the way my course lay, which was due west, but almost full\r\nnorth. However, having a fresh gale, I stretched across this eddy,\r\nslanting north-west; and in about an hour came within about a mile of\r\nthe shore, where, it being smooth water, I soon got to land.\r\n\r\nWhen I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave God thanks for my\r\ndeliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts of my deliverance by\r\nmy boat; and refreshing myself with such things as I had, I brought my\r\nboat close to the shore, in a little cove that I had spied under some\r\ntrees, and laid me down to sleep, being quite spent with the labor and\r\nfatigue of the voyage.\r\n\r\nI was now at a great loss which way to get home with my boat. I had run\r\nso much hazard, and knew too much the case, to think of attempting it\r\nby the way I went out; and what might be at the other side (I mean the\r\nwest side) I knew not, nor had I any mind to run any more ventures. So\r\nI only resolved in the morning to make my way westward along the shore,\r\nand to see if there was no creek where I might lay up my frigate in\r\nsafety, so as to have her again if I wanted her. In about three miles,\r\nor thereabouts, coasting the shore, I came to a very good inlet or bay,\r\nabout a mile over, which narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet\r\nor brook, where I found a very convenient harbor for my boat, and where\r\nshe lay as if she had been in a little dock made on purpose for her.\r\nHere I put in, and having stowed my boat very safe, I went on shore to\r\nlook about me, and see where I was.\r\n\r\nI soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I had been\r\nbefore, when I travelled on foot to that shore; so taking nothing out\r\nof my boat but my gun and my umbrella, for it was exceedingly hot, I\r\nbegan my march. The way was comfortable enough after such a voyage as I\r\nhad been upon, and I reached my old bower in the evening, where I found\r\neverything standing as I left it; for I always kept it in good order,\r\nbeing, as I said before, my country house.\r\n\r\nI got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to rest my limbs,\r\nfor I was very weary, and fell asleep. But judge you, if you can, that\r\nread my story, what a surprise I must be in, when I was waked out of my\r\nsleep by a voice calling me by my name several times, “Robin, Robin,\r\nRobin Crusoe, poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you, Robin Crusoe? Where are\r\nyou? Where have you been?”\r\n\r\nI was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with rowing, or paddling,\r\nas it is called, the first part of the day, and with walking the latter\r\npart, that I did not wake thoroughly; but dozing between sleeping\r\nand waking, thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to me. But as the\r\nvoice continued to repeat “Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe,” at last I\r\nbegan to wake more perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frightened,\r\nand started up in the utmost consternation. But no sooner were my\r\neyes open, but I saw my Poll sitting on the top of the hedge, and\r\nimmediately knew that it was he that spoke to me; for just in such\r\nbemoaning language I had used to talk to him, and teach him; and he\r\nhad learned it so perfectly, that he would sit upon my finger, and\r\nlay his bill close to my face, and cry, “Poor Robin Crusoe! Where are\r\nyou? Where have you been? How come you here?” and such things as I had\r\ntaught him.\r\n\r\nHowever, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that indeed it\r\ncould be nobody else, it was a good while before I could compose\r\nmyself. First, I was amazed how the creature got thither, and then, how\r\nhe should just keep about the place, and nowhere else. But as I was\r\nwell satisfied it could be nobody but honest Poll, I got it over; and\r\nholding out my hand, and calling him by his name, Poll, the sociable\r\ncreature, came to me, and sat upon my thumb, as he used to do, and\r\ncontinued talking to me, “Poor Robin Crusoe! and how did I come here?\r\nand where had I been?” just as if he had been overjoyed to see me\r\nagain; and so I carried him home along with me.\r\n\r\nI had now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and had enough\r\nto do for many days to sit still, and reflect upon the danger I had\r\nbeen in. I would have been very glad to have had my boat again on my\r\nside of the island; but I knew not how it was practicable to get it\r\nabout. As to the east side of the island, which I had gone round, I\r\nknew well enough there was no venturing that way; my very heart would\r\nshrink, and my very blood run chill, but to think of it. And as to the\r\nother side of the island, I did not know how it might be there; but\r\nsupposing the current ran with the same force against the shore at\r\nthe east as it passed by it on the other, I might run the same risk\r\nof being driven down the stream, and carried by the island, as I had\r\nbeen before of being carried away from it. So, with these thoughts, I\r\ncontented myself to be without any boat, though it had been the product\r\nof so many months’ labor to make it and of so many more to get it unto\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nIn this government of my temper I remained near a year, lived a very\r\nsedate, retired life, as you may well suppose; and my thoughts being\r\nvery much composed as to my condition, and fully comforted in resigning\r\nmyself to the dispositions of Providence, I thought I lived really very\r\nhappily in all things, except that of society.\r\n\r\nI improved myself in this time in all the mechanic exercises which my\r\nnecessities put me upon applying myself to, and I believe could, upon\r\noccasion, make a very good carpenter, especially considering how few\r\ntools I had. Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in\r\nmy earthenware, and contrived well enough to make them with a wheel,\r\nwhich I found infinitely easier and better, because I made things round\r\nand shapable which before were filthy things indeed to look on. But I\r\nthink I was never more vain of my own performance, or more joyful for\r\nanything found out, than for my being able to make a tobacco-pipe. And\r\nthough it was a very ugly, clumsy thing when it was done, and only\r\nburnt red, like other earthenware, yet as it was hard and firm, and\r\nwould draw the smoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it; for I had\r\nbeen always used to smoke, and there were pipes in the ship, but I\r\nforgot them at first, not knowing that there was tobacco in the island;\r\nand afterwards, when I searched the ship again, I could not come at any\r\npipes at all.\r\n\r\nIn my wicker-ware also I improved much, and made abundance of necessary\r\nbaskets, as well as my invention showed me; though not very handsome,\r\nyet they were such as were very handy and convenient for my laying\r\nthings up in, or fetching things home in. For example, if I killed a\r\ngoat abroad, I could hang it up in a tree, flay it, and dress it, and\r\ncut it in pieces, and bring it home in a basket; and the like by a\r\nturtle; I could cut it up, take out the eggs, and a piece or two of the\r\nflesh, which was enough for me, and bring them home in a basket, and\r\nleave the rest behind me. Also large deep baskets were my receivers for\r\nmy corn, which I always rubbed out as soon as it was dry, and cured,\r\nand kept it in great baskets.\r\n\r\nI began now to perceive my powder abated considerably, and this was a\r\nwant which it was impossible for me to supply, and I began seriously to\r\nconsider what I must do when I should have no more powder; that is to\r\nsay, how I should do to kill any goats. I had, as is observed, in the\r\nthird year of my being here kept a young kid, and bred her up tame, and\r\nI was in hope of getting a he-goat. But I could not by any means bring\r\nit to pass, till my kid grew an old goat; and I could never find in my\r\nheart to kill her, till she died at last of mere age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n_He Rears a Flock of Goats--His Diary--His Domestic Habits and Style of\r\nLiving--Increasing Prosperity_\r\n\r\n\r\nBut being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and as I have said,\r\nmy ammunition growing low, I set myself to study some art to trap and\r\nsnare the goats, to see whether I could not catch some of them alive;\r\nand particularly, I wanted a she-goat great with young.\r\n\r\nTo this purpose, I made snares to hamper them, and I do believe they\r\nwere more than once taken in them; but my tackle was not good, for I\r\nhad no wire, and I always found them broken, and my bait devoured. At\r\nlength I resolved to try a pitfall; so I dug several large pits in the\r\nearth, in places where I had observed the goats used to feed, and over\r\nthese pits I placed hurdles, of my own making too, with a great weight\r\nupon them; and several times I put ears of barley and dry rice, without\r\nsetting the trap, and I could easily perceive that the goats had gone\r\nin and eaten up the corn, for I could see the mark of their feet. At\r\nlength I set three traps in one night, and going the next morning, I\r\nfound them all standing, and yet the bait eaten and gone; this was very\r\ndiscouraging. However, I altered my trap; and, not to trouble you with\r\nparticulars, going one morning to see my trap, I found in one of them a\r\nlarge old he-goat, and in one of the others three kids, a male and two\r\nfemales.\r\n\r\nAs to the old one, I knew not what to do with him, he was so fierce I\r\ndurst not go into the pit to him; that is to say, to go about to bring\r\nhim away alive, which was what I wanted. I could have killed him, but\r\nthat was not my business, nor would it answer my end; so I even let him\r\nout, and he ran away, as if he had been frightened out of his wits. But\r\nI had forgotten then what I learned afterwards, that hunger will tame\r\na lion. If I had let him stay there three or four days without food,\r\nand then have carried him some water to drink, and then a little corn,\r\nhe would have been as tame as one of the kids, for they are mighty\r\nsagacious, tractable creatures where they are well used.\r\n\r\nHowever, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at that time.\r\nThen I went to the three kids, and taking them one by one, I tied them\r\nwith strings together, and with some difficulty brought them all home.\r\n\r\nIt was a good while before they would feed, but throwing them some\r\nsweet corn, it tempted them, and they began to be tame. And now I\r\nfound that if I expected to supply myself with goat-flesh when I had\r\nno powder or shot left, breeding some up tame was my only way, when\r\nperhaps I might have them about my house like a flock of sheep.\r\n\r\nBut then it presently occurred to me that I must keep the tame from\r\nthe wild, or else they would always run wild when they grew up; and\r\nthe only way for this was to have some enclosed piece of ground, well\r\nfenced either with hedge or pale, to keep them in so effectually, that\r\nthose within might not break out, or those without break in.\r\n\r\nThis was a great undertaking for one pair of hands; yet as I saw there\r\nwas an absolute necessity of doing it, my first piece of work was to\r\nfind out a proper piece of ground, viz., where there was likely to be\r\nherbage for them to eat, water for them to drink, and cover to keep\r\nthem from the sun.\r\n\r\nThose who understand such enclosures will think I had very little\r\ncontrivance when I pitched upon a place very proper for all these,\r\nbeing a plain open piece of meadow land, or savanna (as our people\r\ncall it in the western colonies), which had two or three little drills\r\nof fresh water in it, and at one end was very woody; I say, they will\r\nsmile at my forecast, when I shall tell them I began my enclosing of\r\nthis piece of ground in such a manner, that my hedge or pale must have\r\nbeen at least two miles about. Nor was the madness of it so great as\r\nto the compass, for if it was ten miles about, I was like to have time\r\nenough to do it in. But I did not consider that my goats would be as\r\nwild in so much compass as if they had had the whole island, and I\r\nshould have so much room to chase them in, that I should never catch\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMy hedge was begun and carried on, I believe, about fifty yards, when\r\nthis thought occurred to me, so I presently stopped short, and, for the\r\nfirst beginning, I resolved to enclose a piece of about 150 yards in\r\nlength, and 100 yards in breadth; which, as it would maintain as many\r\nas I should have in any reasonable time, so, as my flock increased, I\r\ncould add more ground to my enclosure.\r\n\r\nThis was acting with some prudence, and I went to work with courage.\r\nI was about three months hedging in the first piece, and, till I had\r\ndone it, I tethered the three kids in the best part of it, and used\r\nthem to feed as near me as possible, to make them familiar; and very\r\noften I would go and carry them some ears of barley, or a handful of\r\nrice, and feed them out of my hand; so that after my enclosure was\r\nfinished, and I let them loose, they would follow me up and down,\r\nbleating after me for a handful of corn.\r\n\r\nThis answered my end, and in about a year and half I had a flock of\r\nabout twelve goats, kids and all; and in two years more I had three and\r\nforty, besides several that I took and killed for my food. And after\r\nthat I enclosed five several pieces of ground to feed them in, with\r\nlittle pens to drive them into, to take them as I wanted, and gates out\r\nof one piece of ground into another.\r\n\r\nBut this was not all, for now I not only had goat’s flesh to feed on\r\nwhen I pleased, but milk too, a thing which, indeed, in my beginning, I\r\ndid not so much as think of, and which, when it came into my thoughts,\r\nwas really an agreeable surprise. For now I set up my dairy, and had\r\nsometimes a gallon or two of milk in a day; and as Nature, who gives\r\nsupplies of food to every creature, dictates even naturally how to make\r\nuse of it, so I, that had never milked a cow, much less a goat, or seen\r\nbutter or cheese made, very readily and handily, though after a great\r\nmany essays and miscarriages, made me both butter and cheese at last,\r\nand never wanted it afterwards.\r\n\r\nHow mercifully can our great Creator treat His creatures, even in those\r\nconditions in which they seemed to be overwhelmed in destruction! How\r\ncan He sweeten the bitterest providences, and give us cause to praise\r\nHim for dungeons and prisons! What a table was here spread for me in a\r\nwilderness, where I saw nothing at first but to perish for hunger!\r\n\r\nIt would have made a stoic smile, to have seen me and my little family\r\nsit down to dinner. There was my majesty, the prince and lord of\r\nthe whole island; I had the lives of all my subjects at my absolute\r\ncommand. I could hang, draw, give liberty, and take it away; and no\r\nrebels among all my subjects.\r\n\r\nThen to see how like a king I dined, too, all alone, attended by my\r\nservants. Poll, as if he had been my favorite, was the only person\r\npermitted to talk to me. My dog, who was now grown very old and crazy,\r\nand had found no species to multiply his kind upon, sat always at my\r\nright hand, and two cats, one on one side the table, and one on the\r\nother, expecting now and then a bit from my hand, as a mark of special\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\nBut these were not the two cats which I brought on shore at first, for\r\nthey were both of them dead, and had been interred near my habitation,\r\nby my own hand. But one of them having multiplied by I know not what\r\nkind of creature, these were two which I had preserved tame, whereas\r\nthe rest ran wild in the woods, and became indeed troublesome to me\r\nat last; for they would often come into my house, and plunder me too,\r\ntill at last I was obliged to shoot them, and did kill a great many;\r\nat length they left me. With this attendance, and in this plentiful\r\nmanner, I lived; neither could I be said to want anything but society;\r\nand of that in some time after this, I was like to have too much.\r\n\r\nI was something impatient, as I have observed, to have the use of my\r\nboat, though very loth to run any more hazards; and therefore sometimes\r\nI sat contriving ways to get her about the island, and at other times\r\nI sat myself down contented enough without her. But I had a strange\r\nuneasiness in my mind to go down to the point of the island, where, as\r\nI have said, in my last ramble, I went up the hill to see how the shore\r\nlay, and how the current set, that I might see what I had to do. This\r\ninclination increased upon me every day, and at length I resolved to\r\ntravel thither by land, following the edge of the shore. I did so; but\r\nhad any one in England been to meet such a man as I was, it must either\r\nhave frightened them, or raised a great deal of laughter; and as I\r\nfrequently stood still to look at myself, I could not but smile at the\r\nnotion of my travelling through Yorkshire, with such an equipage, and\r\nin such a dress. Be pleased to take a sketch of my figure, as follows:\r\n\r\nI had a great high shapeless cap, made of a goat’s skin, with a flap\r\nhanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me, as to shoot the\r\nrain off from running into my neck; nothing being so hurtful in these\r\nclimates as the rain upon the flesh, under the clothes.\r\n\r\nI had a short jacket of goat’s skin, the skirts coming down to about\r\nthe middle of my thighs; and a pair of open-kneed breeches of the same.\r\nThe breeches were made of the skin of an old he-goat, whose hair hung\r\ndown such a length on either side, that, like pantaloons, it reached to\r\nthe middle of my legs. Stockings and shoes I had none, but had made me\r\na pair of somethings, I scarce know what to call them, like buskins, to\r\nflap over my legs, and lace on either side like spatterdashes; but of\r\na most barbarous shape, as indeed were all the rest of my clothes.\r\n\r\nI had on a broad belt of goat’s skin dried, which I drew together with\r\ntwo thongs of the same, instead of buckles; and in a kind of a frog on\r\neither side of this, instead of a sword and a dagger, hung a little\r\nsaw and a hatchet, one on one side, one on the other. I had another\r\nbelt, not so broad, and fastened in the same manner, which hung over my\r\nshoulder; and at the end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches,\r\nboth made of goat’s skin too; in one of which hung my powder, in the\r\nother my shot. At my back I carried my basket, on my shoulder my gun,\r\nand over my head a great clumsy ugly goat-skin umbrella, but which,\r\nafter all, was the most necessary thing I had about me, next to my\r\ngun. As for my face, the color of it was really not so mulatto-like\r\nas one might expect from a man not at all careful of it, and living\r\nwithin nineteen degrees of the equinox. My beard I had once suffered\r\nto grow till it was about a quarter of a yard long; but as I had both\r\nscissors and razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, except\r\nwhat grew on my upper lip, which I had trimmed into a large pair of\r\nMahometan whiskers, such as I had seen worn by some Turks whom I saw at\r\nSallee; for the Moors did not wear such, though the Turks did. Of these\r\nmustachios or whiskers, I will not say they were long enough to hang my\r\nhat upon them, but they were of a length and shape monstrous enough,\r\nand such as, in England, would have passed for frightful.\r\n\r\nBut all this is by the bye; for, as to my figure, I had so few to\r\nobserve me, that it was of no manner of consequence; so I say no more\r\nto that part. In this kind of figure I went my new journey, and was\r\nout five or six days. I travelled first along the sea-shore, directly\r\nto the place where I first brought my boat to an anchor, to get up\r\nupon the rocks. And having no boat now to take care of, I went over\r\nthe land, a nearer way, to the same height that I was upon before;\r\nwhen, looking forward to the point of the rocks which lay out, and\r\nwhich I was obliged to double with my boat, as is said above, I was\r\nsurprised to see the sea all smooth and quiet, no rippling, no motion,\r\nno current, any more there than in other places.\r\n\r\nI was at a strange loss to understand this, and resolved to spend some\r\ntime in the observing it, to see if nothing from the sets of the tide\r\nhad occasioned it. But I was presently convinced how it was, viz., that\r\nthe tide of ebb setting from the west, and joining with the current of\r\nwaters from some great river on the shore, must be the occasion of this\r\ncurrent; and that according as the wind blew more forcibly from the\r\nwest, or from the north, this current came near, or went farther from\r\nthe shore; for waiting thereabouts till evening, I went up to the rock\r\nagain, and then the tide of ebb being made, I plainly saw the current\r\nagain as before, only that it ran farther off, being near half a league\r\nfrom the shore; whereas in my case it set close upon the shore, and\r\nhurried me and my canoe along with it, which, at another time, it would\r\nnot have done.\r\n\r\nThis observation convinced me that I had nothing to do but to observe\r\nthe ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and I might very easily bring\r\nmy boat about the island again. But when I began to think of putting it\r\nin practice, I had such a terror upon my spirits at the remembrance\r\nof the danger I had been in, that I could not think of it again with\r\nany patience; but, on the contrary, I took up another resolution, which\r\nwas more safe, though more laborious; and this was, that I would build,\r\nor rather make me another _periagua_ or canoe; and so have one for one\r\nside of the island, and one for the other.\r\n\r\nYou are to understand that now I had, as I may call it, two plantations\r\nin the island; one, my little fortification or tent, with the wall\r\nabout it, under the rock, with the cave behind me, which, by this time,\r\nI had enlarged into several apartments or caves, one within another.\r\nOne of these, which was the driest and largest, and had a door out\r\nbeyond my wall or fortification, that is to say, beyond where my wall\r\njoined to the rock, was all filled up with the large earthen pots,\r\nof which I have given an account, and with fourteen or fifteen great\r\nbaskets, which would hold five or six bushels each, where I laid up my\r\nstores of provision, especially my corn, some in the ear, cut off short\r\nfrom the straw, and the other rubbed out with my hand.\r\n\r\nAs for my wall, made, as before, with long stakes or piles, those piles\r\ngrew all like trees, and were by this time grown so big, and spread so\r\nvery much, that there was not the least appearance, to any one’s view,\r\nof any habitation behind them.\r\n\r\nNear this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the land, and\r\nupon lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn ground, which I kept duly\r\ncultivated and sowed, and which duly yielded me their harvest in its\r\nseason; and whenever I had occasion for more corn, I had more land\r\nadjoining as fit as that.\r\n\r\nBesides this, I had my country seat, and I had now a tolerable\r\nplantation there also; for, first, I had my little bower, as I called\r\nit, which I kept in repair; that is to say, I kept the hedge which\r\ncircled it in constantly fitted up to its usual height, the ladder\r\nstanding always in the inside. I kept the trees, which at first were no\r\nmore than my stakes, but were now grown very firm and tall, I kept them\r\nalways so cut, that they might spread and grow thick and wild, and make\r\nthe more agreeable shade, which they did effectually to my mind. In the\r\nmiddle of this, I had my tent always standing, being a piece of a sail,\r\nspread over poles, set up for that purpose, and which never wanted any\r\nrepair or renewing; and under this I had made me a squab or couch, with\r\nthe skins of the creatures I had killed, and with other soft things,\r\nand a blanket laid on them, such as belonged to our sea-bedding, which\r\nI had saved, and a great watch-coat to cover me; and here, whenever\r\nI had occasion to be absent from my chief seat, I took up my country\r\nhabitation.\r\n\r\nAdjoining to this I had my enclosures for my cattle, that is to say, my\r\ngoats. And as I had taken an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and\r\nenclose this ground, so I was so uneasy to see it kept entire, lest the\r\ngoats should break through, that I never left off till, with infinite\r\nlabor, I had stuck the outside of the hedge so full of small stakes,\r\nand so near to one another, that it was rather a pale than a hedge,\r\nand there was scarce room to put a hand through between them; which\r\nafterwards, when those stakes grew, as they all did in the next rainy\r\nseason, made the enclosure strong like a wall, indeed, stronger than\r\nany wall.\r\n\r\nThis will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared no\r\npains to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my comfortable\r\nsupport; for I considered the keeping up a breed of tame creatures\r\nthus at my hand would be a living magazine of flesh, milk, butter,\r\nand cheese for me as long as I lived in the place, if it were to be\r\nforty years; and that keeping them in my reach depended entirely upon\r\nmy perfecting my enclosures to such a degree, that I might be sure of\r\nkeeping them together; which, by this method, indeed, I so effectually\r\nsecured, that when these little stakes began to grow, I had planted\r\nthem so very thick, I was forced to pull some of them up again.\r\n\r\nIn this place also I had my grapes growing, which I principally\r\ndepended on for my winter store of raisins, and which I never failed\r\nto preserve very carefully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of\r\nmy whole diet. And indeed they were not agreeable only, but physical,\r\nwholesome, nourishing, and refreshing to the last degree.\r\n\r\nAs this was also about half-way between my other habitation and the\r\nplace where I had laid up my boat, I generally stayed and lay here in\r\nmy way thither; for I used frequently to visit my boat, and I kept all\r\nthings about, or belonging to her, in very good order. Sometimes I went\r\nout in her to divert myself, but no more hazardous voyages would I go,\r\nnor scarce ever above a stone’s cast or two from the shore, I was so\r\napprehensive of being hurried out of my knowledge again by the currents\r\nor winds, or any other accident. But now I come to a new scene of my\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n_Unexpected Alarm--Cause for Apprehension--He Fortifies His Abode_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt happened one day, about noon, going towards my boat, I was\r\nexceedingly surprised with the print of a man’s naked foot on the\r\nshore, which was very plain to be seen in the sand. I stood like one\r\nthunderstruck, or as if I had seen an apparition. I listened, I looked\r\nround me, I could hear nothing, nor see anything. I went up to a rising\r\nground, to look farther. I went up the shore, and down the shore, but\r\nit was all one; I could see no other impression but that one.\r\n\r\nI went to it again to see if there were any more, and to observe if it\r\nmight not be my fancy; but there was no room for that, for there was\r\nexactly the very print of a foot--toes, heel, and every part of a foot.\r\nHow it came thither I knew not, nor could in the least imagine. But\r\nafter innumerable fluttering thoughts, like a man perfectly confused\r\nand out of myself, I came home to my fortification, not feeling, as we\r\nsay, the ground I went on, but terrified to the last degree, looking\r\nbehind me at every two or three steps, mistaking every bush and tree,\r\nand fancying every stump at a distance to be a man; nor is it possible\r\nto describe how many various shapes affrighted imagination represented\r\nthings to me in, how many wild ideas were found every moment in my\r\nfancy, and what strange, unaccountable whimsies came into my thoughts\r\nby the way.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to my castle, for so I think I called it ever after this,\r\nI fled into it like one pursued. Whether I went over by the ladder, as\r\nfirst contrived, or went in at the hole in the rock, which I called a\r\ndoor, I cannot remember; no, nor could I remember the next morning, for\r\nnever frightened hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror\r\nof mind than I to this retreat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_I stood like one thunderstruck, or as if I had seen an\r\napparition_”]\r\n\r\nI slept none that night. The farther I was from the occasion of my\r\nfright, the greater my apprehensions were; which is something contrary\r\nto the nature of such things, and especially to the usual practice of\r\nall creatures in fear. But I was so embarrassed with my own frightful\r\nideas of the thing, that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations\r\nto myself, even though I was now a great way off it. Sometimes I\r\nfancied it must be the devil, and reason joined in with me upon this\r\nsupposition; for how should any other thing in human shape come into\r\nthe place? Where was the vessel that brought them? What marks were\r\nthere of any other footsteps? And how was it possible a man should come\r\nthere? But then to think that Satan should take human shape upon him in\r\nsuch a place, where there could be no manner of occasion for it, but to\r\nleave the print of his foot behind him, and that even for no purpose\r\ntoo, for he could not be sure I should see it; this was an amusement\r\nthe other way. I considered that the devil might have found out\r\nabundance of other ways to have terrified me than this of the single\r\nprint of a foot; that as I lived quite on the other side of the island,\r\nhe would never have been so simple to leave a mark in a place where it\r\nwas ten thousand to one whether I should ever see it or not, and in\r\nthe sand too, which the first surge of the sea, upon a high wind, would\r\nhave defaced entirely. All this seemed inconsistent with the thing\r\nitself, and with all the notions we usually entertain of the subtility\r\nof the devil.\r\n\r\nAbundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out of all\r\napprehensions of its being the devil; and I presently concluded then,\r\nthat it must be some more dangerous creature, viz., that it must be\r\nsome of the savages of the mainland over against me, who had wandered\r\nout to sea in their canoes, and, either driven by the currents or by\r\ncontrary winds, had made the island, and had been on shore, but were\r\ngone away again to sea, being as loth, perhaps, to have stayed in this\r\ndesolate island as I would have been to have had them.\r\n\r\nWhile these reflections were rolling upon my mind, I was very thankful\r\nin my thoughts that I was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that\r\ntime, or that they did not see my boat, by which they would have\r\nconcluded that some inhabitants had been in the place, and perhaps have\r\nsearched farther for me. Then terrible thoughts racked my imagination\r\nabout their having found my boat, and that there were people here; and\r\nthat if so, I should certainly have them come again in greater numbers,\r\nand devour me; and if it should happen so that they should not find me,\r\nyet they would find my enclosure, destroy all my corn, carry away all\r\nmy flock of tame goats, and I should perish at last for mere want.\r\n\r\nThus my fear banished all my religious hope. All that former confidence\r\nin God, which was founded upon such wonderful experience as I had had\r\nof His goodness, now vanished, as if He that had fed me by miracle\r\nhitherto could not preserve, by His power, the provision which He had\r\nmade for me by His goodness. I reproached myself with my easiness,\r\nthat would not sow any more corn one year than would just serve me\r\ntill the next season, as if no accident could intervene to prevent my\r\nenjoying the crop that was upon the ground. And this I thought so just\r\na reproof, that I resolved for the future to have two or three years’\r\ncorn beforehand, so that, whatever might come, I might not perish for\r\nwant of bread.\r\n\r\nHow strange a checker-work of Providence is the life of man! and by\r\nwhat secret differing springs are the affections hurried about as\r\ndiffering circumstances present! To-day we love what to-morrow we\r\nhate; to-day we seek what to-morrow we shun; to-day we desire what\r\nto-morrow we fear; nay, even tremble at the apprehensions of. This was\r\nexemplified in me, at this time, in the most lively manner imaginable;\r\nfor I, whose only affliction was that I seemed banished from human\r\nsociety, that I was alone, circumscribed by the boundless ocean, cut\r\noff from mankind, and condemned to what I called silent life; that I\r\nwas as one whom Heaven thought not worthy to be numbered among the\r\nliving, or to appear among the rest of His creatures; that to have\r\nseen one of my own species would have seemed to me a raising me from\r\ndeath to life, and the greatest blessing that Heaven itself, next to\r\nthe supreme blessing of salvation, could bestow; I say, that I should\r\nnow tremble at the very apprehensions of seeing a man, and was ready to\r\nsink into the ground at but the shadow or silent appearance of a man’s\r\nhaving set his foot in the island!\r\n\r\nSuch is the uneven state of human life; and it afforded me a great many\r\ncurious speculations afterwards, when I had a little recovered my first\r\nsurprise. I considered that this was the station of life the infinitely\r\nwise and good providence of God had determined for me; that, as I could\r\nnot foresee what the ends of Divine wisdom might be in all this, so I\r\nwas not to dispute His sovereignty, who, as I was His creature, had an\r\nundoubted right, by creation, to govern and dispose of me absolutely as\r\nHe thought fit, and who, as I was a creature who had offended Him, had\r\nlikewise a judicial right to condemn me to what punishment He thought\r\nfit; and that it was my part to submit to bear His indignation, because\r\nI had sinned against Him.\r\n\r\nI then reflected that God, who was not only righteous, but omnipotent,\r\nas He had thought fit thus to punish and afflict me, so He was able to\r\ndeliver me; that if He did not think fit to do it ’twas my unquestioned\r\nduty to resign myself absolutely and entirely to His will; and, on\r\nthe other hand, it was my duty also to hope in Him, pray to Him, and\r\nquietly to attend the dictates and directions of His daily providence.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, I may say, weeks and\r\nmonths; and one particular effect of my cogitations on this occasion\r\nI cannot omit, viz., one morning early, lying in my bed, and filled\r\nwith thought about my danger from the appearance of savages, I found\r\nit discomposed me very much; upon which those words of the Scripture\r\ncame into my thoughts, “Call upon Me in the day of trouble, and I will\r\ndeliver, and thou shalt glorify Me.”\r\n\r\nUpon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my heart was not only\r\ncomforted, but I was guided and encouraged to pray earnestly to God for\r\ndeliverance. When I had done praying, I took up my Bible, and opening\r\nit to read, the first words that presented to me were, “Wait on the\r\nLord, and be of good cheer, and He shall strengthen thy heart; wait, I\r\nsay, on the Lord.” It is impossible to express the comfort this gave\r\nme. In answer, I thankfully laid down the book, and was no more sad, at\r\nleast, not on that occasion.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and reflections, it\r\ncame into my thought one day, that all this might be a mere chimera\r\nof my own; and that this foot might be the print of my own foot, when\r\nI came on shore from my boat. This cheered me up a little too, and I\r\nbegan to persuade myself it was all a delusion, that it was nothing\r\nelse but my own foot; and why might not I come that way from the boat,\r\nas well as I was going that way to the boat? Again, I considered also,\r\nthat I could by no means tell, for certain, where I had trod, and where\r\nI had not; and that if, at last, this was only the print of my own\r\nfoot, I had played the part of those fools who strive to make stories\r\nof spectres and apparitions, and then are frightened at them more than\r\nanybody.\r\n\r\nNow I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again, for I had not\r\nstirred out of my castle for three days and nights, so that I began to\r\nstarve for provision; for I had little or nothing within doors but some\r\nbarley-cakes and water. Then I knew that my goats wanted to be milked\r\ntoo, which usually was my evening diversion; and the poor creatures\r\nwere in great pain and inconvenience for want of it; and, indeed, it\r\nalmost spoiled some of them, and almost dried up their milk.\r\n\r\nHeartening myself, therefore, with the belief that this was nothing but\r\nthe print of one of my own feet, and so I might be truly said to start\r\nat my own shadow, I began to go abroad again, and went to my country\r\nhouse to milk my flock. But to see with what fear I went forward, how\r\noften I looked behind me, how I was ready, every now and then, to lay\r\ndown my basket, and run for my life, it would have made any one have\r\nthought I was haunted with an evil conscience, or that I had been\r\nlately most terribly frightened; and so, indeed, I had.\r\n\r\nHowever, as I went down thus two or three days, and having seen\r\nnothing, I began to be a little bolder, and to think there was really\r\nnothing in it but my own imagination. But I could not persuade myself\r\nfully of this till I should go down to the shore again, and see this\r\nprint of a foot, and measure it by my own, and see if there was any\r\nsimilitude or fitness, that I might be assured it was my own foot. But\r\nwhen I came to the place, first, it appeared evidently to me, that\r\nwhen I laid up my boat, I could not possibly be on shore anywhere\r\nthereabout; secondly, when I came to measure the mark with my own\r\nfoot, I found my foot not so large by a great deal. Both these things\r\nfilled my head with new imaginings, and gave me the vapors again to the\r\nhighest degree; so that I shook with cold, like one in an ague; and I\r\nwent home again, filled with the belief that some man or men had been\r\non shore there; or, in short, that the island was inhabited, and I\r\nmight be surprised before I was aware. And what course to take for my\r\nsecurity, I knew not.\r\n\r\nOh, what ridiculous resolutions men take when possessed with fear! It\r\ndeprives them of the use of those means which reason offers for their\r\nrelief. The first thing I proposed to myself was to throw down my\r\nenclosures, and turn all my tame cattle wild into the woods, that the\r\nenemy might not find them, and then frequent the island in prospect of\r\nthe same or the like booty; then to the simple thing of digging up my\r\ntwo cornfields, that they might not find such a grain there, and still\r\nbe prompted to frequent the island; then to demolish my bower and tent,\r\nthat they might not see any vestiges of habitation, and be prompted to\r\nlook farther, in order to find out the persons inhabiting.\r\n\r\nThese were the subject of the first night’s cogitation, after I was\r\ncome home again, while the apprehensions which had so overrun my mind\r\nwere fresh upon me, and my head was full of vapors, as above. Thus\r\nfear of danger is ten thousand times more terrifying than danger\r\nitself when apparent to the eyes; and we find the burden of anxiety\r\ngreater, by much, than the evil which we are anxious about; and, which\r\nwas worse than all this, I had not that relief in this trouble from\r\nthe resignation I used to practise, that I hoped to have. I looked,\r\nI thought, like Saul, who complained not only that the Philistines\r\nwere upon him, but that God had forsaken him; for I did not now take\r\ndue ways to compose my mind, by crying to God in my distress, and\r\nresting upon His providence, as I had done before, for my defence and\r\ndeliverance; which, if I had done, I had at least been more cheerfully\r\nsupported under this new surprise, and perhaps carried through it with\r\nmore resolution.\r\n\r\nThis confusion of my thoughts kept me waking all night, but in the\r\nmorning I fell asleep; and having, by the amusement of my mind, been,\r\nas it were, tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very soundly, and\r\nwaked much better composed than I had ever been before. And now I began\r\nto think sedately; and upon the utmost debate with myself, I concluded\r\nthat this island, which was so exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and no\r\nfarther from the mainland than as I had seen, was not so entirely\r\nabandoned as I might imagine; that although there were no stated\r\ninhabitants who lived on the spot, yet that there might sometimes come\r\nboats off from the shore, which, either with design, or perhaps never\r\nbut when they were driven by cross winds, might come to this place;\r\nthat I had lived here fifteen years now, and had not met with the least\r\nshadow or figure of any people yet; and that if at any time they should\r\nbe driven here, it was probable they went away again as soon as ever\r\nthey could, seeing they had never thought fit to fix there upon any\r\noccasion to this time; that the most I could suggest any danger from,\r\nwas from any such casual accidental landing of straggling people from\r\nthe main, who, as it was likely if they were driven hither, were here\r\nagainst their wills; so they made no stay here, but went off again with\r\nall possible speed, seldom staying one night on shore, lest they should\r\nnot have the help of the tides and daylight back again; and that,\r\ntherefore, I had nothing to do but to consider of some safe retreat, in\r\ncase I should see any savages land upon the spot.\r\n\r\nNow I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so large as to\r\nbring a door through again, which door, as I said, came out beyond\r\nwhere my fortification joined to the rock. Upon maturely considering\r\nthis, therefore, I resolved to draw me a second fortification in the\r\nsame manner of a semicircle, at a distance from my wall, just where I\r\nhad planted a double row of trees about twelve years before, of which\r\nI made mention. These trees having been planted so thick before, they\r\nwanted but a few piles to be driven between them, that they should be\r\nthicker and stronger, and my wall would be soon finished.\r\n\r\nSo that I had now a double wall; and my outer wall was thickened with\r\npieces of timber, old cables, and everything I could think of, to make\r\nit strong, having in it seven little holes, about as big as I might put\r\nmy arm out at. In the inside of this I thickened my wall to about ten\r\nfeet thick, with continual bringing earth out of my cave, and laying\r\nit at the foot of the wall, and walking upon it; and through the seven\r\nholes I contrived to plant the muskets, of which I took notice that I\r\ngot seven on shore out of the ship. These, I say, I planted like my\r\ncannon, and fitted them into frames, that held them like a carriage,\r\nthat so I could fire all the seven guns in two minutes’ time. This wall\r\nI was many a weary month a-finishing, and yet never thought myself safe\r\ntill it was done.\r\n\r\nWhen this was done, I stuck all the ground without my wall, for a great\r\nway every way, as full with stakes, or sticks, of the osier-like wood,\r\nwhich I found so apt to grow, as they could well stand; insomuch, that\r\nI believe I might set in near twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty\r\nlarge space between them and my wall, that I might have room to see\r\nan enemy, and they might have no shelter from the young trees, if they\r\nattempted to approach my outer wall.\r\n\r\nThus in two years’ time I had a thick grove; and in five or six years’\r\ntime I had a wood before my dwelling, growing so monstrous thick and\r\nstrong, that it was indeed perfectly impassable; and no men, of what\r\nkind soever, would ever imagine that there was anything beyond it, much\r\nless a habitation. As for the way which I proposed to myself to go in\r\nand out, for I left no avenue, it was by setting two ladders, one to\r\na part of the rock which was low, and then broke in, and left room to\r\nplace another ladder upon that; so when the two ladders were taken\r\ndown, no man living could come down to me without hurting himself; and\r\nif they had come down, they were still on the outside of my outer wall.\r\n\r\nThus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest for my own\r\npreservation; and it will be seen, at length, that they were not\r\naltogether without just reason; though I foresaw nothing at that time\r\nmore than my mere fear suggested to me.\r\n\r\nWhile this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my other\r\naffairs; for I had a great concern upon me for my little herd of goats.\r\nThey were not only a present supply to me upon every occasion, and\r\nbegan to be sufficient to me, without the expense of powder and shot,\r\nbut also without the fatigue of hunting after the wild ones; and I was\r\nloth to lose the advantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up\r\nover again.\r\n\r\nTo this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of but two\r\nways to preserve them. One was, to find another convenient place to\r\ndig a cave under ground, and to drive them into it every night; and\r\nthe other was, to enclose two or three little bits of land, remote\r\nfrom one another, and as much concealed as I could, where I might keep\r\nabout half a dozen young goats in each place; so that if any disaster\r\nhappened to the flock in general, I might be able to raise them again\r\nwith little trouble and time. And this, though it would require a great\r\ndeal of time and labor, I thought was the most rational design.\r\n\r\nAccordingly I spent some time to find out the most retired parts of the\r\nisland; and I pitched upon one which was as private indeed as my heart\r\ncould wish for. It was a little damp piece of ground, in the middle of\r\nthe hollow and thick woods, where, as is observed, I almost lost myself\r\nonce before, endeavoring to come back that way from the eastern part of\r\nthe island. Here I found a clear piece of land, near three acres, so\r\nsurrounded with woods, that it was almost an enclosure by Nature; at\r\nleast, it did not want near so much labor to make it so as the other\r\npieces of ground I had worked so hard at.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n_Precautions Against Surprise--Robinson Discovers that His Island Has\r\nBeen Visited by Cannibals_\r\n\r\n\r\nI immediately went to work with this piece of ground, and in less than\r\na month’s time I had so fenced it round, that my flock, or herd, call\r\nit which you please, who were not so wild now as at first they might be\r\nsupposed to be, were well enough secured in it. So, without any farther\r\ndelay, I removed ten young she-goats and two he-goats to this piece.\r\nAnd when they were there, I continued to perfect the fence, till I had\r\nmade it as secure as the other, which, however, I did at more leisure,\r\nand it took me up more time by a great deal.\r\n\r\nAll this labor I was at the expense of, purely from my apprehensions\r\non the account of the print of a man’s foot which I had seen; for, as\r\nyet, I never saw any human creature come near the island. And I had\r\nnow lived two years under these uneasinesses, which, indeed, made my\r\nlife much less comfortable than it was before, as may well be imagined\r\nby any who know what it is to live in the constant snare of the fear\r\nof man. And this I must observe, with grief too, that the discomposure\r\nof my mind had too great impressions also upon the religious part of\r\nmy thoughts; for the dread and terror of falling into the hands of\r\nsavages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits, that I seldom found\r\nmyself in a due temper or application to my Maker, at least not with\r\nthe sedate calmness and resignation of soul which I was wont to do.\r\nI rather prayed to God as under great affliction and pressure of\r\nmind, surrounded with danger, and in expectation every night of being\r\nmurdered and devoured before morning; and I must testify from my\r\nexperience, that a temper of peace, thankfulness, love, and affection,\r\nis much more the proper frame for prayer than that of terror and\r\ndiscomposure; and that under the dread of mischief impending, a man is\r\nno more fit for a comforting performance of the duty of praying to God,\r\nthan he is for repentance on a sick-bed. For these discomposures affect\r\nthe mind, as the others do the body; and the discomposure of the mind\r\nmust necessarily be as great a disability as that of the body, and much\r\ngreater, praying to God being properly an act of the mind, not of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nBut to go on. After I had thus secured one part of my little living\r\nstock, I went about the whole island, searching for another private\r\nplace to make such another deposit; when, wandering more to the west\r\npoint of the island than I had ever done yet, and looking out to sea, I\r\nthought I saw a boat upon the sea, at a great distance. I had found a\r\nperspective glass or two in one of the seamen’s chests, which I saved\r\nout of our ship, but I had it not about me; and this was so remote,\r\nthat I could not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it till my\r\neyes were not able to hold to look any longer. Whether it was a boat\r\nor not, I do not know; but as I descended from the hill, I could see\r\nno more of it, so I gave it over; only I resolved to go no more out\r\nwithout a perspective glass in my pocket.\r\n\r\nWhen I was come down the hill to the end of the island, where, indeed,\r\nI had never been before, I was presently convinced that the seeing the\r\nprint of a man’s foot was not such a strange thing in the island as I\r\nimagined. And, but that it was a special providence that I was cast\r\nupon the side of the island where the savages never came, I should\r\neasily have known that nothing was more frequent than for the canoes\r\nfrom the main, when they happened to be a little too far out at sea,\r\nto shoot over to that side of the island for harbor; likewise, as they\r\noften met and fought in their canoes, the victors having taken any\r\nprisoners would bring them over to this shore, where, according to\r\ntheir dreadful customs, being all cannibals, they would kill and eat\r\nthem; of which hereafter.\r\n\r\nWhen I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said above, being the\r\nS.W. point of the island, I was perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is\r\nit possible for me to express the horror of my mind at seeing the shore\r\nspread with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones, of human bodies; and\r\nparticularly, I observed a place where there had been a fire made, and\r\na circle dug in the earth, like a cockpit, where it is supposed the\r\nsavage wretches had sat down to the inhuman feastings upon the bodies\r\nof their fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nI was so astonished with the sight of these things, that I entertained\r\nno notion of any danger to myself from it for a long while. All my\r\napprehensions were buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman,\r\nhellish brutality, and the horror of the degeneracy of human nature,\r\nwhich, though I had heard of often, yet I never had so near a view of\r\nbefore. In short, I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle. My\r\nstomach grew sick, and I was just at the point of fainting, when Nature\r\ndischarged the disorder from my stomach. And having vomited with an\r\nuncommon violence, I was a little relieved, but could not bear to stay\r\nin the place a moment; so I got me up the hill again with all the speed\r\nI could, and walked on towards my own habitation.\r\n\r\nWhen I came a little out of that part of the island, I stood still a\r\nwhile, as amazed; and then recovering myself, I looked up with the\r\nutmost affection of my soul, and with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave\r\nGod thanks, that had cast my first lot in a part of the world where\r\nI was distinguished from such dreadful creatures as these; and that,\r\nthough I had esteemed my present condition very miserable, had yet\r\ngiven me so many comforts in it, that I had still more to give thanks\r\nfor than to complain of; and this above all, that I had, even in this\r\nmiserable condition, been comforted with the knowledge of Himself, and\r\nthe hope of His blessing; which was a felicity more than sufficiently\r\nequivalent to all the misery which I had suffered, or could suffer.\r\n\r\nIn this frame of thankfulness I went home to my castle, and began to be\r\nmuch easier now, as to the safety of my circumstances, than ever I was\r\nbefore; for I observed that these wretches never came to this island in\r\nsearch of what they could get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not\r\nexpecting, anything here; and having often, no doubt, been up in the\r\ncovered, woody part of it, without finding anything to their purpose.\r\nI knew I had been here now almost eighteen years, and never saw the\r\nleast footsteps of human creature there before; and I might be here\r\neighteen more as entirely concealed as I was now, if I did not discover\r\nmyself to them, which I had no manner of occasion to do; it being my\r\nonly business to keep myself entirely concealed where I was, unless I\r\nfound a better sort of creatures than cannibals to make myself known to.\r\n\r\nYet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches that I\r\nhave been speaking of, and of the wretched, inhuman custom of their\r\ndevouring and eating one another up, that I continued pensive and sad,\r\nand kept close within my own circle for almost two years after this.\r\nWhen I say my own circle, I mean by it my three plantations, viz., my\r\ncastle, my country seat, which I called my bower, and my enclosure\r\nin the woods. Nor did I look after this for any other use than as an\r\nenclosure for my goats; for the aversion which Nature gave me to these\r\nhellish wretches was such, that I was fearful of seeing them as of\r\nseeing the devil himself. Nor did I so much as go to look after my boat\r\nin all this time, but began rather to think of making me another; for\r\nI could not think of ever making any more attempts to bring the other\r\nboat round the island to me, lest I should meet with some of these\r\ncreatures at sea, in which, if I had happened to have fallen into their\r\nhands, I knew what would have been my lot.\r\n\r\nTime, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no danger of\r\nbeing discovered by these people, began to wear off my uneasiness\r\nabout them; and I began to live just in the same composed manner as\r\nbefore; only with this difference, that I used more caution, and kept\r\nmy eyes more about me, than I did before, lest I should happen to be\r\nseen by any of them; and particularly, I was more cautious of firing\r\nmy gun, lest any of them being on the island should happen to hear of\r\nit. And it was, therefore, a very good providence to me that I had\r\nfurnished myself with a tame breed of goats, that I needed not hunt\r\nany more about the woods, or shoot at them. And if I did catch any of\r\nthem after this, it was by traps and snares, as I had done before; so\r\nthat for two years after this I believe I never fired my gun once off,\r\nthough I never went out without it; and, which was more, as I had saved\r\nthree pistols out of the ship, I always carried them out with me, or at\r\nleast two of them, sticking them in my goat-skin belt. Also I furbished\r\nup one of the great cutlasses that I had out of the ship, and made me\r\na belt to put it on also; so that I was now a most formidable fellow\r\nto look at when I went abroad, if you add to the former description of\r\nmyself the particular of two pistols, and a great broadsword hanging at\r\nmy side in a belt, but without a scabbard.\r\n\r\nThings going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I seemed,\r\nexcepting these cautions, to be reduced to my former calm, sedate way\r\nof living. All these things tended to showing me, more and more, how\r\nfar my condition was from being miserable, compared to some others;\r\nnay, to many other particulars of life, which it might have pleased\r\nGod to have made my lot. It put me upon reflecting how little repining\r\nthere would be among mankind at any condition of life, if people would\r\nrather compare their condition with those that are worse, in order to\r\nbe thankful, than be always comparing them with those which are better,\r\nto assist their murmurings and complainings.\r\n\r\nAs in my present condition there were not really many things which I\r\nwanted, so indeed I thought that the frights I had been in about these\r\nsavage wretches, and the concern I had been in for my own preservation,\r\nhad taken off the edge of my invention for my own conveniences. And\r\nI had dropped a good design, which I had once bent my thoughts too\r\nmuch upon; and that was, to try if I could not make some of my barley\r\ninto malt, and then try to brew myself some beer. This was really a\r\nwhimsical thought, and I reproved myself often for the simplicity of\r\nit; for I presently saw there would be the want of several things\r\nnecessary to the making my beer, that it would be impossible for me to\r\nsupply. As, first, casks to preserve it in, which was a thing that, as\r\nI have observed already, I could never compass; no, though I spent not\r\nmany days, but weeks, nay, months, in attempting it, but to no purpose.\r\nIn the next place, I had no hops to make it keep, no yeast to make it\r\nwork, no copper or kettle to make it boil; and yet all these things\r\nnotwithstanding, I verily believe, had not these things intervened,\r\nI mean the frights and terrors I was in about the savages, I had\r\nundertaken it, and perhaps brought it to pass too; for I seldom gave\r\nanything over without accomplishing it when I once had it in my head\r\nenough to begin it.\r\n\r\nBut my invention now ran quite another way; for, night and day, I\r\ncould think of nothing but how I might destroy some of these monsters\r\nin their cruel, bloody entertainment, and, if possible, save the\r\nvictim they should bring hither to destroy. It would take up a larger\r\nvolume than this whole work is intended to be, to set down all the\r\ncontrivances I hatched, or rather brooded upon, in my thought, for\r\nthe destroying these creatures, or at least frightening them so as to\r\nprevent their coming hither any more. But all was abortive; nothing\r\ncould be possible to take effect, unless I was to be there to do it\r\nmyself. And what could one man do among them, when perhaps there might\r\nbe twenty or thirty of them together, with their darts, or their bows\r\nand arrows, which they could shoot as true to a mark as I could with my\r\ngun?\r\n\r\nSometimes I contrived to dig a hole under the place where they made\r\ntheir fire, and put in five or six pounds of gunpowder, which, when\r\nthey kindled their fire, would consequently take fire, and blow up all\r\nthat was near it. But as, in the first place, I should be very loth to\r\nwaste so much powder upon them, my store being now within the quantity\r\nof one barrel, so neither could I be sure of its going off at any\r\ncertain time, when it might surprise them; and, at best, that it would\r\ndo little more than just blow the fire about their ears, and frighten\r\nthem, but not sufficient to make them forsake the place. So I laid it\r\naside, and then proposed that I would place myself in ambush in some\r\nconvenient place, with my three guns all double-loaded, and, in the\r\nmiddle of their bloody ceremony, let fly at them, when I should be sure\r\nto kill or wound perhaps two or three at every shot; and then falling\r\nin upon them with my three pistols and my sword, I made no doubt but\r\nthat if there was twenty I should kill them all. This fancy pleased my\r\nthoughts for some weeks; and I was so full of it, that I often dreamed\r\nof it, and sometimes that I was just going to let fly at them in my\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nI went so far with it in my imagination, that I employed myself several\r\ndays to find out proper places to put myself in ambuscade, as I said,\r\nto watch for them; and I went frequently to the place itself, which\r\nwas now grown more familiar to me; and especially while my mind was\r\nthus filled with thoughts of revenge, and of a bloody putting twenty\r\nor thirty of them to the sword, as I may call it, the horror I had at\r\nthe place, and at the signals of the barbarous wretches devouring one\r\nanother, abated my malice.\r\n\r\nWell, at length I found a place in the side of the hill, where I was\r\nsatisfied I might securely wait till I saw any of their boats coming;\r\nand might then, even before they would be ready to come on shore,\r\nconvey myself, unseen, into thickets of trees, in one of which there\r\nwas a hollow large enough to conceal me entirely; and where I might\r\nsit and observe all their bloody doings, and take my full aim at their\r\nheads, when they were so close together, as that it would be next to\r\nimpossible that I should miss my shot, or that I could fail wounding\r\nthree or four of them at the first shot.\r\n\r\nIn this place, then, I resolved to fix my design; and, accordingly, I\r\nprepared two muskets and my ordinary fowling-piece. The two muskets I\r\nloaded with a brace of slugs each, and four or five smaller bullets,\r\nabout the size of pistol-bullets; and the fowling-piece I loaded\r\nwith near a handful of swanshot, of the largest size. I also loaded\r\nmy pistols with about four bullets each; and in this posture, well\r\nprovided with ammunition for a second and third charge, I prepared\r\nmyself for my expedition.\r\n\r\nAfter I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and in my imagination\r\nput it in practice, I continually made my tour every morning up to the\r\ntop of the hill, which was from my castle, as I called it, about three\r\nmiles, or more, to see if I could observe any boats upon the sea coming\r\nnear the island, or standing over towards it. But I began to tire of\r\nthis hard duty, after I had, for two or three months, constantly kept\r\nmy watch, but came always back without any discovery; there having not,\r\nin all that time, been the least appearance, not only on or near the\r\nshore, but not on the whole ocean so far as my eyes or glasses could\r\nreach every way.\r\n\r\nAs long as I kept up my daily tour to the hill to look out, so long\r\nalso I kept up the vigor of my design, and my spirits seemed to be\r\nall the while in a suitable form for so outrageous an execution as\r\nthe killing twenty or thirty naked savages for an offence which I had\r\nnot at all entered into a discussion of in my thoughts, any farther\r\nthan my passions were at first fired by the horror I conceived at the\r\nunnatural custom of that people of the country; who, it seems, had\r\nbeen suffered by Providence, in His wise disposition of the world, to\r\nhave no other guide than that of their own abominable and vitiated\r\npassions; and consequently were left, and perhaps had been so for some\r\nages, to act such horrid things, and receive such dreadful customs,\r\nas nothing but nature entirely abandoned of Heaven, and acted by some\r\nhellish degeneracy, could have run them into. But now when, as I have\r\nsaid, I began to be weary of the fruitless excursion which I had made\r\nso long and so far every morning in vain, so my opinion of the action\r\nitself began to alter; and I began, with cooler and calmer thoughts, to\r\nconsider what it was I was going to engage in.\r\n\r\nWhat authority or call I had to pretend to be judge and executioner\r\nupon these men as criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit, for so many\r\nages, to suffer, unpunished, to go on, and to be, as it were, the\r\nexecutioners of His judgments one upon another? How far these people\r\nwere offenders against me, and what right I had to engage in the\r\nquarrel of that blood which they shed promiscuously one upon another?\r\nI debated this very often with myself, thus: How do I know what God\r\nHimself judges in this particular case? It is certain these people\r\neither do not commit this as a crime; it is not against their own\r\nconsciences’ reproving, or their light reproaching them. They do not\r\nknow it to be an offense, and then commit it in defiance of Divine\r\njustice, as we do in almost all the sins we commit. They think it no\r\nmore a crime to kill a captive taken in war, than we do to kill an ox;\r\nnor to eat human flesh, than we do to eat mutton.\r\n\r\nWhen I had considered this a little, it followed necessarily that I\r\nwas certainly in the wrong in it; that these people were not murderers\r\nin the sense that I had before condemned them in my thoughts, any\r\nmore than those Christians were murderers who often put to death the\r\nprisoners taken in battle; or more frequently, upon many occasions, put\r\nwhole troops of men to the sword, without giving quarter, though they\r\nthrew down their arms and submitted.\r\n\r\nIn the next place it occurred to me, that albeit the usage they thus\r\ngave one another was thus brutish and inhuman, yet it was really\r\nnothing to me; these people had done me no injury. That if they\r\nattempted me, or I saw it necessary for my immediate preservation to\r\nfall upon them, something might be said for it; but that as I was\r\nyet out of their power, and they had really no knowledge of me, and\r\nconsequently no design upon me, and therefore it could not be just\r\nfor me to fall upon them. That this would justify the conduct of the\r\nSpaniards in all their barbarities practised in America, and where they\r\ndestroyed millions of these people; who, however they were idolaters\r\nand barbarians, and had several bloody and barbarous rites in their\r\ncustoms, such as sacrificing human bodies to their idols, were yet, as\r\nto the Spaniards, very innocent people; and that the rooting them out\r\nof the country is spoken of with the utmost abhorrence and detestation\r\nby even the Spaniards themselves at this time, and by all other\r\nChristian nations of Europe, as a mere butchery, a bloody and unnatural\r\npiece of cruelty, unjustifiable either to God or man; and such, as\r\nfor which the very name of a Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and\r\nterrible to all people of humanity, or of Christian compassion; as if\r\nthe kingdom of Spain were particularly eminent for the product of a\r\nrace of men who were without principles of tenderness, or the common\r\nbowels of pity to the miserable, which is reckoned to be a mark of\r\ngenerous temper in the mind.\r\n\r\nThese considerations really put me to a pause, and to a kind of a full\r\nstop; and I began, by little and little, to be off of my design, and\r\nto conclude I had taken wrong measures in my resolutions to attack\r\nthe savages; that it was not my business to meddle with them, unless\r\nthey first attacked me; and this it was my business, if possible, to\r\nprevent; but that if I were discovered and attacked, then I knew my\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I argued with myself that this really was the way\r\nnot to deliver myself, but entirely to ruin and destroy myself; for\r\nunless I was sure to kill every one that not only should be on shore at\r\nthat time, but that should ever come on shore afterwards, if but one of\r\nthem escaped to tell their country people what had happened, they would\r\ncome over again by thousands to revenge the death of their fellows,\r\nand I should only bring upon myself a certain destruction, which, at\r\npresent, I had no manner of occasion for.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, I concluded that neither in principles nor in policy\r\nI ought, one way or other, to concern myself in this affair. That my\r\nbusiness was, by all possible means, to conceal myself from them, and\r\nnot to leave the least signal to them to guess by that there were any\r\nliving creatures upon the island; I mean of human shape.\r\n\r\nReligion joined in with this prudential, and I was convinced now,\r\nmany ways, that I was perfectly out of my duty when I was laying all\r\nmy bloody schemes for the destruction of innocent creatures; I mean\r\ninnocent as to me. As to the crimes they were guilty of towards one\r\nanother, I had nothing to do with them. They were national, and I ought\r\nto leave them to the justice of God, who is the Governor of nations,\r\nand knows how, by national punishments, to make a just retribution for\r\nnational offenses, and to bring public judgments upon those who offend\r\nin a public manner by such ways as best pleases Him.\r\n\r\nThis appeared so clear to me now, that nothing was a greater\r\nsatisfaction to me than that I had not been suffered to do a thing\r\nwhich I now saw so much reason to believe would have been no less a\r\nsin than that of wilful murder, if I had committed it. And I gave most\r\nhumble thanks on my knees to God, that had thus delivered me from\r\nblood-guiltiness; beseeching Him to grant me the protection of His\r\nprovidence, that I might not fall into the hands of the barbarians, or\r\nthat I might not lay my hands upon them, unless I had a more clear call\r\nfrom Heaven to do it, in defense of my own life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n_Robinson Discovers a Cave, which Serves Him as a Retreat Against the\r\nSavages_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this disposition I continued for near a year after this; and so far\r\nwas I from desiring an occasion for falling upon these wretches, that\r\nin all that time I never once went up the hill to see whether there\r\nwere any of them in sight, or to know whether any of them had been on\r\nshore there or not, that I might not be tempted to renew any of my\r\ncontrivances against them, or be provoked, by any advantage which might\r\npresent itself, to fall upon them. Only this I did, I went and removed\r\nmy boat, which I had on the other side the island, and carried it down\r\nto the east end of the whole island, where I ran it into a little cove,\r\nwhich I found under some high rocks, and where I knew, by reason of the\r\ncurrents, the savages durst not, at least would not come, with their\r\nboats, upon any account whatsoever.\r\n\r\nWith my boat I carried away everything that I had left there belonging\r\nto her, though not necessary for the bare going thither, viz., a mast\r\nand sail which I had made for her, and a thing like an anchor, but\r\nindeed which could not be called either anchor or grappling; however,\r\nit was the best I could make of its kind. All these I removed,\r\nthat there might not be the least shadow of any discovery, or any\r\nappearance of any boat, or of any human habitation, upon the island.\r\n\r\nBesides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired than ever, and\r\nseldom went from my cell, other than upon my constant employment, viz.,\r\nto milk my she-goats, and manage my little flock in the wood, which, as\r\nit was quite on the other part of the island, was quite out of danger;\r\nfor certain it is, that these savage people, who sometimes haunted\r\nthis island, never came with any thoughts of finding anything here,\r\nand consequently never wandered off from the coast; and I doubt not\r\nbut they might have been several times on shore after my apprehensions\r\nof them had made me cautious, as well as before; and indeed, I looked\r\nback with some horror upon the thoughts of what my condition would have\r\nbeen if I had chopped upon them and been discovered before that, when,\r\nnaked and unarmed, except with one gun, and that loaded often only with\r\nsmall shot, I walked everywhere, peeping and peeping about the island\r\nto see what I could get. What a surprise should I have been in if,\r\nwhen I discovered the print of a man’s foot, I had, instead of that,\r\nseen fifteen or twenty savages, and found them pursuing me, and by the\r\nswiftness of their running, no possibility of my escaping them!\r\n\r\nThe thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very soul within me, and\r\ndistressed my mind so much, that I could not soon recover it, to think\r\nwhat I should have done, and how I not only should not have been\r\nable to resist them, but even should not have had presence of mind\r\nenough to do what I might have done, much less what now, after so much\r\nconsideration and preparation, I might be able to do. Indeed, after\r\nserious thinking of these things, I should be very melancholy, and\r\nsometimes it would last a great while; but I resolved it, at last, all\r\ninto thankfulness to that Providence which had delivered me from so\r\nmany unseen dangers, and had kept me from those mischiefs which I could\r\nno way have been the agent in delivering myself from, because I had not\r\nthe least notion of any such thing depending, or the least supposition\r\nof it being possible.\r\n\r\nThis renewed a contemplation which often had come to my thoughts in\r\nformer time, when first I began to see the merciful dispositions of\r\nHeaven, in the dangers we run through in this life. How wonderfully\r\nwe are delivered when we know nothing of it. How, when we are in a\r\nquandary, as we call it, a doubt or hesitation, whether to go this way,\r\nor that way, a secret hint shall direct us this way, when we intended\r\nto go that way; nay, when sense, our own inclination, and perhaps\r\nbusiness, has called to go the other way, yet a strange impression upon\r\nthe mind, from we know not what springs, and by we know not what power,\r\nshall overrule us to go this way; and it shall afterwards appear,\r\nthat had we gone that way which we should have gone, and even to our\r\nimagination ought to have gone, we should have been ruined and lost.\r\nUpon these and many like reflections I afterwards made it a certain\r\nrule with me, that whenever I found those secret hints or pressings\r\nof my mind to doing, or not doing, anything that presented, or to\r\ngoing this way or that way, I never failed to obey the secret dictate,\r\nthough I knew no other reason for it than that such a pressure, or\r\nsuch a hint, hung upon my mind. I could give many examples of the\r\nsuccess of this conduct in the course of my life, but more especially\r\nin the latter part of my inhabiting this unhappy island; besides many\r\noccasions which it is very likely I might have taken notice of, if I\r\nhad seen with the same eyes then that I saw with now. But ’tis never\r\ntoo late to be wise; and I cannot but advise all considering men, whose\r\nlives are attended with such extraordinary incidents as mine, or even\r\nthough not so extraordinary, not to slight such secret intimations\r\nof Providence, let them come from what invisible intelligence they\r\nwill. That I shall not discuss, and perhaps cannot account for; but\r\ncertainly they are a proof of the converse of spirits, and the secret\r\ncommunication between those embodied and those unembodied, and such\r\na proof as can never be withstood, of which I shall have occasion to\r\ngive some very remarkable instances in the remainder of my solitary\r\nresidence in this dismal place.\r\n\r\nI believe the reader of this will not think strange if I confess\r\nthat these anxieties, these constant dangers I lived in, and the\r\nconcern that was now upon me, put an end to all invention, and to all\r\nthe contrivances that I had laid for my future accommodations and\r\nconveniences. I had the care of my safety more now upon my hands than\r\nthat of my food. I cared not to drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood\r\nnow, for fear the noise I should make should be heard; much less would\r\nI fire a gun, for the same reason; and, above all, I was intolerably\r\nuneasy at making any fire, lest the smoke, which is visible at a great\r\ndistance in the day, should betray me; and for this reason I removed\r\nthat part of my business which required fire, such as burning of pots\r\nand pipes, etc., into my new apartment in the woods; where, after I had\r\nbeen some time, I found, to my unspeakable consolation, a mere natural\r\ncave in the earth, which went in a vast way, and where, I dare say, no\r\nsavage, had he been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy as to venture\r\nin; nor, indeed, would any man else, but one who, like me, wanted\r\nnothing so much as a safe retreat.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock, where, by\r\nmere accident I would say (if I did not see abundant reason to ascribe\r\nall such things now to Providence), I was cutting down some thick\r\nbranches of trees to make charcoal; and before I go on, I must observe\r\nthe reason of my making this charcoal, which was thus.\r\n\r\nI was afraid of making a smoke about my habitation, as I said before;\r\nand yet I could not live there without baking my bread, cooking my\r\nmeat, etc. So I contrived to burn some wood here, as I had seen done in\r\nEngland under turf, till it became chark, or dry coal; and then putting\r\nthe fire out, I preserved the coal to carry home, and perform the other\r\nservices which fire was wanting for at home, without danger of smoke.\r\n\r\nBut this is by the bye. While I was cutting down some wood here,\r\nI perceived that behind a very thick branch of low brushwood, or\r\nunderwood, there was a kind of hollow place. I was curious to look into\r\nit; and getting with difficulty into the mouth of it, I found it was\r\npretty large; that is to say, sufficient for me to stand upright in\r\nit, and perhaps another with me. But I must confess to you I made more\r\nhaste out than I did in when, looking farther into the place, and which\r\nwas perfectly dark, I saw two broad shining eyes of some creature,\r\nwhether devil or man I knew not, which twinkled like two stars, the\r\ndim light from the cave’s mouth shining directly in, and making the\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\nHowever, after some pause I recovered myself, and began to call myself\r\na thousand fools, and tell myself that he that was afraid to see the\r\ndevil was not fit to live twenty years on an island all alone, and\r\nthat I durst to believe there was nothing in this cave that was more\r\nfrightful than myself. Upon this, plucking up my courage, I took up\r\na great firebrand, and in I rushed again, with the stick flaming in\r\nmy hand. I had not gone three steps in, but I was almost as much\r\nfrightened as I was before; for I heard a very loud sigh, like that\r\nof a man in some pain, and it was followed by a broken noise, as if\r\nof words half expressed, and then a deep sigh again. I stepped back,\r\nand was indeed struck with such a surprise, that it put me into a\r\ncold sweat; and if I had had a hat on my head, I will not answer for\r\nit, that my hair might not have lifted it off. But still plucking up\r\nmy spirits as well as I could, and encouraging myself a little with\r\nconsidering that the power and presence of God was everywhere, and was\r\nable to protect me, upon this I stepped forward again, and by the light\r\nof the firebrand, holding it up a little over my head, I saw lying on\r\nthe ground a most monstrous, frightful, old he-goat, just making his\r\nwill, as we say, and gasping for life; and dying, indeed, of mere old\r\nage.\r\n\r\nI stirred him a little to see if I could get him out, and he essayed to\r\nget up, but was not able to raise himself; and I thought with myself\r\nhe might even lie there; for if he had frightened me so, he would\r\ncertainly frighten any of the savages, if any of them should be so\r\nhardy as to come in there while he had any life in him.\r\n\r\nI was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look around me, when\r\nI found the cave was but very small; that is to say, it might be about\r\ntwelve feet over, but in no manner of shape, either round or square, no\r\nhands having ever been employed in making it but those of mere Nature.\r\nI observed also that there was a place at the farther side of it that\r\nwent in farther, but was so low, that it required me to creep upon my\r\nhands and knees to go into it, and whither I went I knew not; so having\r\nno candle, I gave it over for some time, but resolved to come again the\r\nnext day, provided with candles and a tinderbox, which I had made of\r\nthe lock of one of the muskets, with some wild-fire in the pan.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the next day I came provided with six large candles of\r\nmy own making, for I made very good candles now of goat’s tallow; and\r\ngoing into this low place, I was obliged to creep upon all fours, as\r\nI have said, almost ten yards; which, by the way, I thought was a\r\nventure bold enough, considering that I knew not how far it might go,\r\nnor what was beyond it. When I was got through the strait, I found the\r\nroof rose higher up, I believe near twenty feet. But never was such\r\na glorious sight seen in the island, I dare say, as it was, to look\r\nround the sides and roof of this vault or cave; the walls reflected a\r\nhundred thousand lights to me from my two candles. What it was in the\r\nrock, whether diamonds, or any other precious stones, or gold, which I\r\nrather supposed it to be, I knew not.\r\n\r\nThe place I was in was a most delightful cavity or grotto of its kind,\r\nas could be expected, though perfectly dark. The floor was dry and\r\nlevel, and had a sort of small loose gravel upon it, so that there was\r\nno nauseous or venomous creature to be seen; neither was there any\r\ndamp or wet on the sides or roof. The only difficulty in it was the\r\nentrance, which, however, as it was a place of security, and such a\r\nretreat as I wanted, I thought that was a convenience; so that I was\r\nreally rejoiced at the discovery, and resolved, without any delay,\r\nto bring some of those things which I was most anxious about to this\r\nplace; particularly, I resolved to bring hither my magazine of powder,\r\nand all my spare arms, viz., two fowling-pieces, for I had three in\r\nall, and three muskets, for of them I had eight in all. So I kept at my\r\ncastle only five, which stood ready-mounted, like pieces of cannon, on\r\nmy outmost fence; and were ready also to take out upon any expedition.\r\n\r\nUpon this occasion of removing my ammunition, I took occasion to open\r\nthe barrel of powder, which I took up out of the sea, and which had\r\nbeen wet; and I found that the water had penetrated about three or four\r\ninches into the powder on every side, which caking, and growing hard,\r\nhad preserved the inside like a kernel in a shell; so that I had near\r\nsixty pounds of very good powder in the centre of the cask. And this\r\nwas an agreeable discovery to me at that time; so I carried all away\r\nthither, never keeping above two or three pounds of powder with me in\r\nmy castle, for fear of a surprise of any kind. I also carried thither\r\nall the lead I had left for bullets.\r\n\r\nI fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants, which were said to\r\nlive in caves and holes in the rocks, where none could come at them;\r\nfor I persuaded myself, while I was here, if five hundred savages were\r\nto hunt me, they could never find me out; or, if they did, they would\r\nnot venture to attack me here.\r\n\r\nThe old goat, whom I found expiring, died in the mouth of the cave the\r\nnext day after I made this discovery; and I found it much easier to dig\r\na great hole there, and throw him in and cover him with earth, than to\r\ndrag him out; so I interred him there, to prevent offense to my nose.\r\n\r\nI was now in my twenty-third year of residence in this island; and was\r\nso naturalized to the place, and to the manner of living, that could\r\nI have but enjoyed the certainty that no savages would come to the\r\nplace to disturb me, I could have been content to have capitulated\r\nfor spending the rest of my time there, even to the last moment, till\r\nI laid me down and died, like the old goat in the cave. I had also\r\narrived to some little diversions and amusements, which made the time\r\npass more pleasantly with me a great deal than it did before. As,\r\nfirst, I had taught my Poll, as I noted before, to speak; and he did\r\nit so familiarly, and talked so articulately and plain, that it was\r\nvery pleasant to me; and he lived with me no less than six and twenty\r\nyears. How long he might live afterwards I know not, though I know they\r\nhave a notion in the Brazils that they live a hundred years. Perhaps\r\npoor Poll may be alive there still, calling after poor Robin Crusoe to\r\nthis day. I wish no Englishman the ill luck to come there and hear\r\nhim; but if he did, he would certainly believe it was the devil. My dog\r\nwas a very pleasant and loving companion to me for no less than sixteen\r\nyears of my time, and then died of mere old age. As for my cats, they\r\nmultiplied, as I have observed, to that degree, that I was obliged to\r\nshoot several of them at first to keep them from devouring me and all I\r\nhad; but at length, when the two old ones I brought with me were gone,\r\nand after some time continually driving them from me, and letting them\r\nhave no provision with me, they all ran wild into the woods, except two\r\nor three favorites, which I kept tame, and whose young, when they had\r\nany, I always drowned; and these were part of my family. Besides these,\r\nI always kept two or three household kids about me, which I taught to\r\nfeed out of my hand. And I had two more parrots, which talked pretty\r\nwell, and would all call “Robin Crusoe,” but none like my first; nor,\r\nindeed, did I take the pains with any of them that I had done with him.\r\nI had also several tame sea-fowls, whose names I know not, which I\r\ncaught upon the shore, and cut their wings; and the little stakes which\r\nI had planted before my castle wall being now grown up to a good thick\r\ngroove, these fowls all lived among these low trees, and bred there,\r\nwhich was very agreeable to me; so that, as I said above, I began to\r\nbe very well contented with the life I led, if it might but have been\r\nsecured from the dread of the savages.\r\n\r\nBut it was otherwise directed; and it may not be amiss for all people\r\nwho shall meet with my story, to make this just observation from it,\r\nviz., how frequently, in the course of our lives, the evil which in\r\nitself we seek most to shun, and which, when we are fallen into it, is\r\nthe most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very means or door of our\r\ndeliverance, by which alone we can be raised again from the affliction\r\nwe are fallen into. I could give many examples of this in the course\r\nof my unaccountable life; but in nothing was it more particularly\r\nremarkable, than in the circumstances of my last years of solitary\r\nresidence in this island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n_Another Visit of the Savages--Robinson Sees Them Dancing--He Perceives\r\nthe Wreck of a Vessel_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was now the month of December, as I said above, in my twenty-third\r\nyear; and this, being the southern solstice (for winter I cannot call\r\nit), was the particular time of my harvest, and required my being\r\npretty much abroad in the fields; when, going out pretty early in the\r\nmorning, even before it was thorough daylight, I was surprised with\r\nseeing a light of some fire upon the shore, at a distance from me of\r\nabout two miles, towards the end of the island, where I had observed\r\nsome savages had been, as before. But not on the other side; but, to my\r\ngreat affliction, it was on my side of the island.\r\n\r\nI was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped short within\r\nmy grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be surprised; and yet I\r\nhad no more peace within, from the apprehensions I had that if these\r\nsavages, in rambling over the island, should find my corn standing\r\nor cut, or any of my works and improvements, they would immediately\r\nconclude that there were people in the place, and would then never give\r\nover till they had found me out. In this extremity I went back directly\r\nto my castle, pulled up the ladder after me, and made all things\r\nwithout look as wild and natural as I could.\r\n\r\nThen I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture of defense.\r\nI loaded all my cannon, as I called them, that is to say, my muskets,\r\nwhich were mounted upon my new fortification, and all my pistols, and\r\nresolved to defend myself to the last gasp; not forgetting seriously to\r\ncommend myself to the Divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God\r\nto deliver me out of the hands of the barbarians. And in this posture\r\nI continued about two hours; but began to be mighty impatient for\r\nintelligence abroad, for I had no spies to send out.\r\n\r\nAfter sitting a while longer, and musing what I should do in this case,\r\nI was not able to bear sitting in ignorance any longer; so setting\r\nup my ladder to the side of the hill where there was a flat place,\r\nas I observed before, and then pulling the ladder up after me, I set\r\nit up again, and mounted to the top of the hill; and pulling out my\r\nperspective-glass, which I had taken on purpose, I laid me down flat on\r\nmy belly on the ground, and began to look for the place. I presently\r\nfound there was no less than nine naked savages sitting round a small\r\nfire they had made, not to warm them, for they had no need of that, the\r\nweather being extreme hot, but, as I supposed, to dress some of their\r\nbarbarous diet of human flesh which they had brought with them, whether\r\nalive or dead, I could not know.\r\n\r\nThey had two canoes with them, which they had hauled up upon the\r\nshore; and as it was then tide of ebb, they seemed to me to wait for\r\nthe return of the flood to go away again. It is not easy to imagine\r\nwhat confusion this sight put me into, especially seeing them come on\r\nmy side the island, and so near me too. But when I observed their\r\ncoming must be always with the current of the ebb, I began afterwards\r\nto be more sedate in my mind, being satisfied that I might go abroad\r\nwith safety all the time of the tide of flood, if they were not on\r\nshore before; and having made this observation, I went abroad about my\r\nharvest-work with the more composure.\r\n\r\nAs I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the tide made to the\r\nwestward, I saw them all take boat, and row (or paddle, as we call it)\r\nall away. I should have observed, that for an hour and more before\r\nthey went off, they went to dancing; and I could easily discern their\r\npostures and gestures by my glasses. I could not perceive, by my nicest\r\nobservation, but that they were stark naked, and had not the least\r\ncovering upon them; but whether they were men or women, that I could\r\nnot distinguish.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns upon my\r\nshoulders, and two pistols at my girdle, and my great sword by my side,\r\nwithout a scabbard, and with all the speed I was able to make I went\r\naway to the hill where I had discovered the first appearance of all.\r\nAnd as soon as I got thither, which was not less than two hours (for\r\nI could not go apace, being so laden with arms as I was), I perceived\r\nthere had been three canoes more of savages on that place; and looking\r\nout farther, I saw they were all at sea together, making over for the\r\nmain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_I laid me down flat on my belly on the ground, and\r\nbegan to look for the place_”]\r\n\r\nThis was a dreadful sight to me, especially when, going down to the\r\nshore, I could see the marks of horror which the dismal work they had\r\nbeen about had left behind it, viz., the blood, the bones, and part\r\nof the flesh of human bodies, eaten and devoured by those wretches with\r\nmerriment and sport. I was so filled with indignation at the sight,\r\nthat I began now to premeditate the destruction of the next that I saw\r\nthere, let them be who or how many soever.\r\n\r\nIt seemed evident to me that the visits which they thus made to this\r\nisland were not very frequent, for it was above fifteen months before\r\nany more of them came on shore there again; that is to say, I neither\r\nsaw them, nor any footsteps nor signals of them, in all that time; for,\r\nas to the rainy seasons, then they are sure not to come abroad, at\r\nleast not so far. Yet all this while I lived uncomfortably, by reason\r\nof the constant apprehensions I was in of their coming upon me by\r\nsurprise; from whence I observe, that the expectation of evil is more\r\nbitter than the suffering, especially if there is no room to shake off\r\nthat expectation, or those apprehensions.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time I was in a murdering humor, and took up most of\r\nmy hours, which should have been better employed, in contriving how to\r\ncircumvent and fall upon them the very next time I should see them;\r\nespecially if they should be divided, as they were the last time, into\r\ntwo parties. Nor did I consider at all that if I killed one party,\r\nsuppose ten or a dozen, I was still the next day, or week, or month,\r\nto kill another, and so another, even _ad infinitum_, till I should be\r\nat length no less a murderer than they were in being man-eaters, and\r\nperhaps much more so.\r\n\r\nI spent my days now in great perplexity and anxiety of mind, expecting\r\nthat I should, one day or other, fall into the hands of these\r\nmerciless creatures; and if I did at any time venture abroad, it\r\nwas not without looking round me with the greatest care and caution\r\nimaginable. And now I found, to my great comfort, how happy it was that\r\nI provided for a tame flock or herd of goats; for I durst not, upon any\r\naccount, fire my gun, especially near that side of the island where\r\nthey usually came, lest I should alarm the savages. And if they had\r\nfled from me now, I was sure to have them come back again, with perhaps\r\ntwo or three hundred canoes with them, in a few days, and then I knew\r\nwhat to expect.\r\n\r\nHowever, I wore out a year and three months more before I ever saw\r\nany more of the savages, and then I found them again, as I shall soon\r\nobserve. It is true they might have been there once or twice, but\r\neither they made no stay, or at least I did not hear them; but in\r\nthe month of May, as near as I could calculate, and in my four and\r\ntwentieth year, I had a very strange encounter with them; of which in\r\nits place.\r\n\r\nThe perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen or sixteen months’\r\ninterval, was very great. I slept unquiet, dreamed always frightful\r\ndreams, and often started out of my sleep in the night. In the day\r\ngreat troubles overwhelmed my mind, and in the night I dreamed often of\r\nkilling the savages, and of the reasons why I might justify the doing\r\nof it. But, to waive all this for a while, it was in the middle of\r\nMay, on the sixteenth day, I think, as well as my poor wooden calendar\r\nwould reckon, for I marked all upon the post still: I say, it was the\r\nsixteenth of May that it blew a very great storm of wind all day, with\r\na great deal of lightning and thunder, and a very foul night it was\r\nafter it. I know not what was the particular occasion of it, but as\r\nI was reading in the Bible, and taken up with very serious thoughts\r\nabout my present condition, I was surprised with a noise of a gun, as I\r\nthought, fired at sea.\r\n\r\nThis was, to be sure, a surprise of a quite different nature from any\r\nI had met with before; for the notions this put into my thoughts were\r\nquite of another kind. I started up in the greatest haste imaginable,\r\nand, in a trice, clapped my ladder to the middle place of the rock, and\r\npulled it after me; and mounting it the second time, got to the top of\r\nthe hill the very moment that flash of fire bid me listen for a second\r\ngun, which accordingly, in about half a minute, I heard; and, by the\r\nsound, knew that it was from that part of the sea where I was driven\r\ndown the current in my boat.\r\n\r\nI immediately considered that this must be some ship in distress, and\r\nthat they had some comrade, or some other ship in company, and fired\r\nthese guns for signals of distress, and to obtain help. I had this\r\npresence of mind, at that minute, as to think that though I could not\r\nhelp them, it may be they might help me; so I brought together all the\r\ndry wood I could get at hand, and, making a good handsome pile, I set\r\nit on fire upon the hill. The wood was dry, and blazed freely; and\r\nthough the wind blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out; so that I was\r\ncertain, if there was any such thing as a ship, they must needs see it,\r\nand no doubt they did; for as soon as ever my fire blazed up I heard\r\nanother gun, and after that several others, all from the same quarter.\r\nI plied my fire all night long till day broke; and when it was broad\r\nday, and the air cleared up, I saw something at a great distance at\r\nsea, full east of the island, whether a sail or a hull I could not\r\ndistinguish, no, not with my glasses, the distance was so great, and\r\nthe weather still something hazy also; at least it was so out at sea.\r\n\r\nI looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived that it did\r\nnot move; so I presently concluded that it was a ship at an anchor. And\r\nbeing eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in my hand\r\nand ran toward the south side of the island, to the rocks where I had\r\nformerly been carried away with the current; and getting up there, the\r\nweather by this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly see, to my\r\ngreat sorrow, the wreck of a ship, cast away in the night upon those\r\nconcealed rocks which I found when I was out in my boat; and which\r\nrocks, as they checked the violence of the stream, and made a kind of\r\ncounter-stream or eddy, were the occasion of my recovering from the\r\nmost desperate, hopeless condition that ever I had been in in all my\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThus, what is one man’s safety is another man’s destruction; for it\r\nseems these men, whoever they were, being out of their knowledge, and\r\nthe rocks being wholly under water, had been driven upon them in the\r\nnight, the wind blowing hard at E. and E.N.E. Had they seen the island,\r\nas I must necessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I thought,\r\nhave endeavored to have saved themselves on shore by the help of their\r\nboat; but their firing of guns for help, especially when they saw, as I\r\nimagined, my fire, filled me with many thoughts. First, I imagined that\r\nupon seeing my light, they might have put themselves into their boat,\r\nand have endeavored to make the shore; but that the sea going very\r\nhigh, they might have been cast away. Other times I imagined that they\r\nmight have lost their boat before, as might be the case many ways; as,\r\nparticularly, by the breaking of the sea upon their ship, which many\r\ntimes obliges men to stave, or take in pieces their boat, and sometimes\r\nto throw it overboard with their own hands.\r\n\r\nOther times I imagined they had some other ship or ships in company,\r\nwho, upon the signals of distress they had made, had taken them up and\r\ncarried them off. Other times I fancied they were all gone off to sea\r\nin their boat, and being hurried away by the current that I had been\r\nformerly in, were carried out into the great ocean, where there was\r\nnothing but misery and perishing; and that, perhaps, they might by this\r\ntime think of starving, and of being in a condition to eat one another.\r\n\r\nAs all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the condition I was\r\nin, I could do no more than look on upon the misery of the poor men,\r\nand pity them; which had still this good effect on my side, that it\r\ngave me more and more cause to give thanks to God, who had so happily\r\nand comfortably provided for me in my desolate condition; and that\r\nof two ships’ companies who were now cast away upon this part of the\r\nworld, not one life should be spared but mine. I learned here again\r\nto observe, that it is very rare that the providence of God casts us\r\ninto any condition of life so low, or any misery so great, but we may\r\nsee something or other to be thankful for, and may see others in worse\r\ncircumstances than our own.\r\n\r\nSuch certainly was the case of these men, of whom I could not so much\r\nas see room to suppose any of them were saved. Nothing could make it\r\nrational so much as to wish or expect that they did not all perish\r\nthere, except the possibility only of their being taken up by another\r\nship in company; and this was but mere possibility indeed, for I saw\r\nnot the least sign or appearance of any such thing.\r\n\r\nI cannot explain, by any possible energy of words, what a strange\r\nlonging or hankering of desires I felt in my soul upon this sight,\r\nbreaking out sometimes thus: “Oh that there had been but one or two,\r\nnay, or but one soul, saved out of this ship, to have escaped to me,\r\nthat I might but have had one companion, one fellow-creature, to have\r\nspoken to me, and to have conversed with!” In all the time of my\r\nsolitary life, I never felt so earnest, so strong a desire after the\r\nsociety of my fellow-creatures, or so deep a regret at the want of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n_He Visits the Wreck and Obtains many Stores from it--Again Thinks of\r\nQuitting the Island--Has a Remarkable Dream_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some secret moving springs in the affections which, when they\r\nare set agoing by some object in view, or be it some object, though not\r\nin view, yet rendered present to the mind by the power of imagination,\r\nthat motion carries out the soul by its impetuosity to such violent,\r\neager embracings of the object, that the absence of it is insupportable.\r\n\r\nSuch were these earnest wishings that but one man had been saved! “Oh\r\nthat it had been but one!” I believe I repeated the words a thousand\r\ntimes; and the desires were so moved by it, that when I spoke the\r\nwords my hands would clinch together, and my fingers press the palms\r\nof my hands, that if I had had any soft thing in my hand, it would\r\nhave crushed it involuntarily; and my teeth in my head would strike\r\ntogether, and set against one another so strong, that for some time I\r\ncould not part them again.\r\n\r\nLet the naturalists explain these things, and the reason and manner of\r\nthem. All I can say to them is to describe the fact, which was even\r\nsurprising to me when I found it, though I knew not from what it should\r\nproceed. It was doubtless the effect of ardent wishes, and of strong\r\nideas formed in my mind, realising the comfort which the conversation\r\nof one of my fellow-Christians would have been to me.\r\n\r\nBut it was not to be. Either their fate or mine, or both, forbid it;\r\nfor, till the last year of my being on this island, I never knew\r\nwhether any were saved out of that ship or no; and had only the\r\naffliction, some days after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy come\r\non shore at the end of the island which was next the shipwreck. He had\r\non no clothes but a seaman’s waistcoat, a pair of open-kneed linen\r\ndrawers, and a blue linen shirt; but nothing to direct me so much as\r\nto guess what nation he was of. He had nothing in his pocket but two\r\npieces of eight and a tobacco-pipe. The last was to me of ten times\r\nmore value than the first.\r\n\r\nIt was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in my boat to\r\nthis wreck, not doubting but I might find something on board that\r\nmight be useful to me. But that did not altogether press me so much\r\nas the possibility that there might be yet some living creature on\r\nboard, whose life I might not only save, but might, by saving that\r\nlife, comfort my own to the last degree. And this thought clung so to\r\nmy heart, that I could not be quiet night nor day, but I must venture\r\nout in my boat on board this wreck; and committing the rest to God’s\r\nprovidence, I thought, the impression was so strong upon my mind\r\nthat it could not be resisted, that it must come from some invisible\r\ndirection, and that I should be wanting to myself if I did not go.\r\n\r\nUnder the power of this impression, I hastened back to my castle,\r\nprepared everything for my voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great\r\npot for fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum (for I had\r\nstill a great deal of that left), a basket full of raisins. And thus,\r\nloading myself with everything necessary, I went down to my boat, got\r\nthe water out of her, and got her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her,\r\nand then went home again for more. My second cargo was a great bag\r\nfull of rice, the umbrella to set up over my head for shade, another\r\nlarge pot full of fresh water, and about two dozen of my small loaves,\r\nor barley-cakes, more than before, with a bottle of goat’s milk and\r\na cheese; all of which, with great labor and sweat, I brought to my\r\nboat. And praying to God to direct my voyage, I put out; and rowing,\r\nor paddling, the canoe along the shore, I came at last to the utmost\r\npoint of the island on that side, viz., N.E. And now I was to launch\r\nout into the ocean, and either to venture or not to venture. I looked\r\non the rapid currents which ran constantly on both sides of the island\r\nat a distance, and which were very terrible to me, from the remembrance\r\nof the hazard I had been in before, and my heart began to fail me; for\r\nI foresaw that if I was driven into either of those currents, I should\r\nbe carried a vast way out to sea, and perhaps out of my reach, or sight\r\nof the island again; and that then, as my boat was but small, if any\r\nlittle gale of wind should rise, I should be inevitably lost.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began to give over my\r\nenterprise; and having hauled my boat into a little creek on the shore,\r\nI stepped out, and sat me down upon a little rising bit of ground, very\r\npensive and anxious, between fear and desire, about my voyage; when, as\r\nI was musing, I could perceive that the tide was turned, and the flood\r\ncome on; upon which my going was for so many hours impracticable. Upon\r\nthis, presently it occurred to me that I should go up to the highest\r\npiece of ground I could find and observe, if I could, how the sets of\r\nthe tide, or currents, lay when the flood came in, that I might judge\r\nwhether, if I was driven one way out, I might not expect to be driven\r\nanother way home, with the same rapidness of the currents. This thought\r\nwas no sooner in my head but I cast my eye upon a little hill, which\r\nsufficiently overlooked the sea both ways, and from whence I had a\r\nclear view of the currents, or sets of the tide, and which way I was\r\nto guide myself in my return. Here I found, that as the current of the\r\nebb set out close by the south point of the island, so the current of\r\nthe flood set in close by the shore of the north side; and that I had\r\nnothing to do but to keep to the north of the island in my return, and\r\nI should do well enough.\r\n\r\nEncouraged with this observation, I resolved the next morning to set\r\nout with the first of the tide, and reposing myself for the night in\r\nthe canoe, under the great watch-coat I mention, I launched out. I\r\nmade first a little out to sea, full north, till I began to feel the\r\nbenefit of the current which set eastward, and which carried me at a\r\ngreat rate; and yet did not so hurry me as the southern side current\r\nhad done before, and so as to take from me all government of the boat;\r\nbut having a strong steerage with my paddle, I went at a great rate\r\ndirectly for the wreck, and in less than two hours I came up to it.\r\n\r\nIt was a dismal sight to look at. The ship, which, by its building,\r\nwas Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in between two rocks. All the stern\r\nand quarter of her was beaten to pieces with the sea; and as her\r\nforecastle, which stuck in the rocks, had run on with great violence,\r\nher mainmast and foremast were brought by the board; that is to say,\r\nbroken short off; but her bowsprit was sound, and the head and bow\r\nappeared firm. When I came close to her a dog appeared upon her, who,\r\nseeing me coming, yelped and cried; and as soon as I called him, jumped\r\ninto the sea to come to me, and I took him into the boat, but found him\r\nalmost dead for hunger and thirst. I gave him a cake of my bread, and\r\nhe ate it like a ravenous wolf that had been starving a fortnight in\r\nthe snow. I then gave the poor creature some fresh water, with which,\r\nif I would have let him, he would have burst himself.\r\n\r\nAfter this I went on board; but the first sight I met with was two men\r\ndrowned in the cook-room, or forecastle of the ship, with their arms\r\nfast about one another. I concluded, as is indeed probable, that when\r\nthe ship struck, it being in a storm, the sea broke so high, and so\r\ncontinually over her, that the men were not able to bear it, and were\r\nstrangled with the constant rushing in of the water, as much as if\r\nthey had been under water. Besides the dog, there was nothing left in\r\nthe ship that had life; nor any goods that I could see, but what were\r\nspoiled by the water. There were some casks of liquor, whether wine or\r\nbrandy I knew not, which lay lower in the hold, and which, the water\r\nbeing ebbed out, I could see; but they were too big to meddle with. I\r\nsaw several chests which I believed belonged to some of the seamen; and\r\nI got two of them into the boat, without examining what was in them.\r\n\r\nHad the stern of the ship been fixed, and the forepart broken off, I am\r\npersuaded I might have made a good voyage; for by what I found in these\r\ntwo chests, I had room to suppose the ship had a great deal of wealth\r\non board; and if I may guess by the course she steered, she must have\r\nbeen bound from the Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the south\r\npart of America, beyond the Brazils, to Havana, in the Gulf of Mexico,\r\nand so perhaps to Spain. She had, no doubt, a great treasure in her,\r\nbut of no use, at that time, to anybody; and what became of the rest of\r\nher people, I then knew not.\r\n\r\nI found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, of about\r\ntwenty gallons, which I got into my boat with much difficulty. There\r\nwere several muskets in a cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about\r\nfour pounds of powder in it. As for the muskets, I had no occasion for\r\nthem, so I left them, but took the powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel\r\nand tongs, which I wanted extremely; as also two little brass kettles,\r\na copper pot to make chocolate, and a gridiron. And with this cargo,\r\nand the dog, I came away, the tide beginning to make home again; and\r\nthe same evening, about an hour within night, I reached the island\r\nagain, weary and fatigued to the last degree.\r\n\r\nI reposed that night in the boat; and in the morning I resolved to\r\nharbor what I had gotten in my new cave, not to carry it home to my\r\ncastle. After refreshing myself, I got all my cargo on shore, and began\r\nto examine the particulars. The cask of liquor I found to be a kind of\r\nrum, but not such as we had at the Brazils, and, in a word, not at all\r\ngood. But when I came to open the chests, I found several things of\r\ngreat use to me. For example, I found in one a fine case of bottles,\r\nof an extraordinary kind, and filled with cordial waters, fine, and\r\nvery good; the bottles held about three pints each, and were tipped\r\nwith silver. I found two pots of very good succades, or sweetmeats, so\r\nfastened also on top, that the salt water had not hurt them; and two\r\nmore of the same, which the water had spoiled. I found some very good\r\nshirts, which were very welcome to me; and about a dozen and half of\r\nlinen white handkerchiefs and colored neck-cloths. The former were also\r\nvery welcome, being exceeding refreshing to wipe my face on a hot day.\r\nBesides this, when I came to the till in the chest, I found there three\r\ngreat bags of pieces of eight, which held out about eleven hundred\r\npieces in all; and in one of them, wrapped up in a paper, six doubloons\r\nof gold, and some small bars or wedges of gold. I suppose they might\r\nall weigh near a pound.\r\n\r\nThe other chest I found had some clothes in it, but of little value;\r\nbut by the circumstances, it must have belonged to the gunner’s mate;\r\nthough there was no powder in it, but about two pounds of fine glazed\r\npowder, in three small flasks, kept, I suppose, for charging their\r\nfowling-pieces on occasion. Upon the whole, I got very little by\r\nthis voyage that was of any use to me; for as to the money, I had no\r\nmanner of occasion for it; ’twas to me as the dirt under my feet; and\r\nI would have given it all for three or four pair of English shoes and\r\nstockings, which were things I greatly wanted, but had not had on my\r\nfeet now for many years. I had indeed gotten two pair of shoes now,\r\nwhich I took off of the feet of the two drowned men whom I saw in the\r\nwreck, and I found two pair more in one of the chests which were very\r\nwelcome to me; but they were not like our English shoes, either for\r\nease or service, being rather what we call pumps than shoes. I found in\r\nthis seaman’s chest about fifty pieces of eight in royals, but no gold.\r\nI suppose this belonged to a poorer man than the other, which seemed to\r\nbelong to some officer.\r\n\r\nWell, however, I lugged this money home to my cave, and laid it up, as\r\nI had done that before which I brought from our own ship; but it was\r\ngreat pity, as I said, that the other part of this ship had not come to\r\nmy share, for I am satisfied I might have loaded my canoe several times\r\nover with money, which, if I had ever escaped to England, would have\r\nlain here safe enough till I might have come again and fetched it.\r\n\r\nHaving now brought all my things on shore, and secured them, I went\r\nback to my boat, and rowed or paddled her along the shore to her old\r\nharbor, where I laid her up, and made the best of my way to my old\r\nhabitation, where I found everything safe and quiet. So I began to\r\nrepose myself, live after my old fashion, and take care of my family\r\naffairs; and, for a while, I lived easy enough, only that I was more\r\nvigilant than I used to be, looked out oftener, and did not go abroad\r\nso much; and if at any time I did stir with any freedom, it was always\r\nto the east part of the island, where I was pretty well satisfied the\r\nsavages never came and where I could go without so many precautions,\r\nand such a load of arms and ammunition as I always carried with me if I\r\nwent the other way.\r\n\r\nI lived in this condition near two years more; but my unlucky head,\r\nthat was always to let me know it was born to make my body miserable,\r\nwas all this two years filled with projects and designs, how, if it\r\nwere possible, I might get away from this island; for sometimes I was\r\nfor making another voyage to the wreck, though my reason told me that\r\nthere was nothing left there worth the hazard of my voyage; sometimes\r\nfor a ramble one way, sometimes another; and I believe verily, if I had\r\nhad the boat that I went from Sallee in, I should have ventured to sea,\r\nbound anywhere, I knew not whither.\r\n\r\nI have been, in all my circumstances, a memento to those who are\r\ntouched with the general plague of mankind, whence, for aught I know\r\none-half of their miseries flow; I mean, that of not being satisfied\r\nwith the station wherein God and Nature has placed them; for now to\r\nlook back upon my primitive condition, and the excellent advice of my\r\nfather, the opposition to which was, as I may call it, my _original\r\nsin_, my subsequent mistakes of the same kind had been the means of\r\nmy coming into this miserable condition; for had that Providence,\r\nwhich so happily had seated me at the Brazils as a planter, blessed me\r\nwith confined desires, and I could have been contented to have gone\r\non gradually, I might have been, by this time, I mean in the time of\r\nmy being in this island, one of the most considerable planters in the\r\nBrazils; nay, I am persuaded that by the improvements I had made in\r\nthat little time I lived there, and the increase I should probably\r\nhave made if I had stayed, I might have been worth an hundred thousand\r\nmoidores. And what business had I to leave a settled fortune, a\r\nwell-stocked plantation, improving and increasing, to turn supercargo\r\nto Guinea to fetch negroes, when patience and time would have so\r\nincreased our stock at home, that we could have bought them at our own\r\ndoor from those whose business it was to fetch them; and though it had\r\ncost us something more, yet the difference of that price was by no\r\nmeans worth saving at so great a hazard.\r\n\r\nBut as this is ordinarily the fate of young heads, so reflection upon\r\nthe folly of it is as ordinarily the exercise of more years, or of\r\nthe dear-bought experience of time; and so it was with me now. And\r\nyet, so deep had the mistake taken root in my temper, that I could\r\nnot satisfy myself in my station, but was continually poring upon the\r\nmeans and possibility of my escape from this place. And that I may,\r\nwith the greater pleasure to the reader, bring on the remaining part\r\nof my story, it may not be improper to give some account of my first\r\nconceptions on the subject of this foolish scheme for my escape, and\r\nhow, and upon what foundation, I acted.\r\n\r\nI am now to be supposed retired into my castle, after my late voyage to\r\nthe wreck, my frigate laid up and secured under water, as usual, and my\r\ncondition restored to what it was before. I had more wealth, indeed,\r\nthan I had before, but was not at all the richer; for I had no more use\r\nfor it than the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards came there.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the four and\r\ntwentieth year of my first setting foot in this island of solitariness.\r\nI was lying in my bed, or hammock, awake, very well in health, had no\r\npain, no distemper, no uneasiness of body, no, nor any uneasiness of\r\nmind, more than ordinary, but could by no means close my eyes, that\r\nis, so as to sleep; no, not a wink all night long, otherwise than as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nIt is as impossible, as needless, to set down the innumerable crowd of\r\nthoughts that whirled through that great thoroughfare of the brain, the\r\nmemory, in this night’s time. I ran over the whole history of my life\r\nin miniature, or by abridgment, as I may call it, to my coming to this\r\nisland, and also of the part of my life since I came to this island. In\r\nmy reflections upon the state of my case since I came on shore on this\r\nisland, I was comparing the happy posture of my affairs in the first\r\nyears of my habitation here compared to the life of anxiety, fear, and\r\ncare which I had lived ever since I had seen the print of a foot in the\r\nsand; not that I did not believe the savages had frequented the island\r\neven all the while, and might have been several hundreds of them at\r\ntimes on shore there; but I had never know it, and was incapable of any\r\napprehensions about it. My satisfaction was perfect, though my danger\r\nwas the same; and I was as happy in not knowing my danger, as if I had\r\nnever really been exposed to it. This furnished my thoughts with many\r\nvery profitable reflections, and particularly this one: how infinitely\r\ngood that Providence is which has provided, in its government of\r\nmankind, such narrow bounds to his sight and knowledge of things; and\r\nthough he walks in the midst of so many thousand dangers, the sight\r\nof which, if discovered to him, would distract his mind and sink his\r\nspirits, he is kept serene and calm, by having the events of things hid\r\nfrom his eyes, and knowing nothing of the dangers which surround him.\r\n\r\nAfter these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I came to\r\nreflect seriously upon the real danger I had been in for so many\r\nyears in this very island, and how I had walked about in the greatest\r\nsecurity, and with all possible tranquillity, even when perhaps nothing\r\nbut a brow of a hill, a great tree, or the casual approach of night\r\nhad been between me and the worst kind of destruction, viz., that\r\nof falling into the hands of cannibals and savages, who would have\r\nseized on me with the same view as I did of a goat or a turtle, and\r\nhave thought it no more a crime to kill and devour me, than I did of\r\na pigeon or a curlew. I would unjustly slander myself if I should say\r\nI was not sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, to whose singular\r\nprotection I acknowledged, with great humility, that all these unknown\r\ndeliverances were due, and without which I must inevitably have fallen\r\ninto their merciless hands.\r\n\r\nWhen these thoughts were over, my head was for some time taken up in\r\nconsidering the nature of these wretched creatures, I mean the savages,\r\nand how it came to pass in the world that the wise Governor of all\r\nthings should give up any of His creatures to such inhumanity; nay, to\r\nsomething so much below even brutality itself, as to devour its own\r\nkind. But as this ended in some (at that time fruitless) speculations,\r\nit occurred to me to inquire what part of the world these wretches\r\nlived in? how far off the coast was from whence they came? what they\r\nventured over so far from home for? what kind of boats they had? and\r\nwhy I might not order myself and my business so, that I might be as\r\nable to go over thither, as they were to come to me.\r\n\r\nI never so much as troubled myself to consider what I should do with\r\nmyself when I came thither; what would become of me, if I fell into\r\nthe hands of the savages; or how I should escape from them, if they\r\nattempted me; no, nor so much as how it was possible for me to reach\r\nthe coast, and not be attempted by some or other of them, without\r\nany possibility of delivering myself; and if I should not fall into\r\ntheir hands, what I should do for provision; or whither I should bend\r\nmy course. None of these thoughts, I say, so much as came in my way;\r\nbut my mind was wholly bent upon the notion of my passing over in my\r\nboat to the mainland. I looked back upon my present condition as the\r\nmost miserable that could possibly be; that I was not able to throw\r\nmyself into anything, but death, that could be called worse; that if I\r\nreached the shore of the main, I might perhaps meet with relief, or I\r\nmight coast along, as I did on the shore of Africa, till I came to some\r\ninhabited country, and where I might find some relief; and after all,\r\nperhaps I might fall in with some Christian ship that might take me in;\r\nand if the worse came to the worst, I could but die, which would put an\r\nend to all these miseries at once. Pray, note, all this was the fruit\r\nof a disturbed mind, an impatient temper, made as it were desperate\r\nby the long continuance of my troubles, and the disappointments I had\r\nmet in the wreck I had been on board of, and where I had been so near\r\nthe obtaining what I so earnestly longed for, viz., somebody to speak\r\nto, and to learn some knowledge from of the place where I was, and of\r\nthe probable means of my deliverance. I say, I was agitated wholly by\r\nthese thoughts. All my calm of mind, in my resignation to Providence,\r\nand waiting the issue of the dispositions of Heaven, seemed to be\r\nsuspended; and I had, as it were, no power to turn my thoughts to\r\nanything but to the project of a voyage to the main, which came upon me\r\nwith such force, and such an impetuosity of desire, that it was not to\r\nbe resisted.\r\n\r\nWhen this had agitated my thoughts for two hours, or more, with such\r\nviolence that it set my very blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat\r\nas high as if I had been in a fever, merely with the extraordinary\r\nfervor of my mind about it, Nature, as if I had been fatigued and\r\nexhausted with the very thought of it, threw me into a sound sleep. One\r\nwould have thought I should have dreamed of it, but I did not, nor of\r\nanything relating to it; but I dreamed that as I was going out in the\r\nmorning, as usual, from my castle, I saw upon the shore two canoes and\r\neleven savages coming to land, and that they brought with them another\r\nsavage, whom they were going to kill in order to eat him; when, on a\r\nsudden, the savage that they were going to kill jumped away, and ran\r\nfor his life. And I thought, in my sleep, that he came running into my\r\nlittle thick grove before my fortification to hide himself; and that I,\r\nseeing him alone, and not perceiving that the others sought him that\r\nway, showed myself to him, and smiling upon him, encouraged him; that\r\nhe kneeled down to me, seeming to pray me to assist him; upon which I\r\nshowed my ladder, made him go up, and carried him into my cave, and he\r\nbecame my servant; and that as soon as I had gotten this man, I said to\r\nmyself, “Now I may certainly venture to the mainland; for this fellow\r\nwill serve me as a pilot, and will tell me what to do, and whither to\r\ngo for provisions, and whither not to go for fear of being devoured;\r\nwhat places to venture into, and what to escape.” I waked with this\r\nthought, and was under such inexpressible impressions of joy at the\r\nprospect of my escape in my dream, that the disappointments which I\r\nfelt upon coming to myself and finding it was no more than a dream\r\nwere equally extravagant the other way, and threw me into a very great\r\ndejection of spirit.\r\n\r\nUpon this, however, I made this conclusion; that my only way to go\r\nabout an attempt for an escape was, if possible, to get a savage into\r\nmy possession; and, if possible, it should be one of their prisoners\r\nwhom they had condemned to be eaten, and should bring thither to kill.\r\nBut these thoughts still were attended with this difficulty, that it\r\nwas impossible to effect this without attacking a whole caravan of\r\nthem, and killing them all; and this was not only a very desperate\r\nattempt, and might miscarry, but, on the other hand, I had greatly\r\nscrupled the lawfulness of it to me; and my heart trembled at the\r\nthoughts of shedding so much blood, though it was for my deliverance.\r\nI need not repeat the arguments which occurred to me against this,\r\nthey being the same mentioned before. But though I had other reasons\r\nto offer now, viz., that those men were enemies to my life, and would\r\ndevour me if they could; that it was self-preservation, in the highest\r\ndegree, to deliver myself from this death of a life, and was acting in\r\nmy own defence as much as if they were actually assaulting me, and the\r\nlike; I say, though these things argued for it, yet the thoughts of\r\nshedding human blood for my deliverance were very terrible to me, and\r\nsuch as I could by no means reconcile myself to a great while.\r\n\r\nHowever, at last, after many secret disputes with myself, and after\r\ngreat perplexities about it, for all these arguments, one way and\r\nanother, struggled in my head a long time, the eager prevailing desire\r\nof deliverance at length mastered all the rest, and I resolved, if\r\npossible, to get one of those savages into my hands, cost what it\r\nwould. My next thing then was to contrive how to do it, and this indeed\r\nwas very difficult to resolve on. But as I could pitch upon no probable\r\nmeans for it, so I resolved to put myself upon the watch, to see them\r\nwhen they came on shore, and leave the rest to the event, taking such\r\nmeasures as the opportunity should present, let be what would be.\r\n\r\nWith these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon the scout as\r\noften as possible, and indeed so often, till I was heartily tired of\r\nit; for it was above a year and half that I waited; and for great part\r\nof that time went out to the west end, and to the south-west corner of\r\nthe island, almost every day, to see for canoes, but none appeared.\r\nThis was very discouraging, and began to trouble me much; though I\r\ncannot say that it did in this case, as it had done some time before\r\nthat, viz., wear off the edge of my desire to the thing. But the longer\r\nit seemed to be delayed, the more eager I was for it. In a word, I was\r\nnot at first so careful to shun the sight of these savages, and avoid\r\nbeing seen by them, as I was now eager to be upon them.\r\n\r\nBesides, I fancied myself able to manage one, nay, two or three\r\nsavages, if I had them, so as to make them entirely slaves to me, to do\r\nwhatever I should direct them, and to prevent their being able at any\r\ntime to do me any hurt. It was a great while that I pleased myself with\r\nthis affair; but nothing still presented. All my fancies and schemes\r\ncame to nothing, for no savages came near me for a great while.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n_Robinson Rescues One of Their Captives from the Savages, Whom He Names\r\nFriday, and Makes His Servant_\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout a year and half after I had entertained these notions, and by\r\nlong musing had, as it were, resolved them all into nothing, for want\r\nof an occasion to put them in execution, I was surprised, one morning\r\nearly, with seeing no less than five canoes all on shore together on my\r\nside the island, and the people who belonged to them all landed, and\r\nout of my sight. The number of them broke all my measures; for seeing\r\nso many, and knowing that they always came four, or six, or sometimes\r\nmore, in a boat, I could not tell what to think of it, or how to take\r\nmy measures to attack twenty or thirty men single-handed; so I lay\r\nstill in my castle, perplexed and discomforted. However, I put myself\r\ninto all the same postures for an attack that I had formerly provided,\r\nand was just ready for action if anything had presented. Having waited\r\na good while, listening to hear if they made any noise, at length,\r\nbeing very impatient, I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, and\r\nclambered up to the top of the hill, by my two stages, as usual;\r\nstanding so, however, that my head did not appear above the hill, so\r\nthat they could not perceive me by any means. Here I observed, by the\r\nhelp of my perspective-glass, that they were no less than thirty in\r\nnumber, that they had a fire kindled, that they had had meat dressed.\r\nHow they had cooked it, that I knew not, or what it was; but they were\r\nall dancing, in I know not how many barbarous gestures and figures,\r\ntheir own way, round the fire.\r\n\r\nWhile I was thus looking on them, I perceived by my perspective two\r\nmiserable wretches dragged from the boats, where, it seems, they were\r\nlaid by, and were now brought out for the slaughter. I perceived one of\r\nthem immediately fell, being knocked down, I suppose, with a club or\r\nwooden sword, for that was their way, and two or three others were at\r\nwork immediately, cutting him open for their cookery, while the other\r\nvictim was left standing by himself, till they should be ready for\r\nhim. In that very moment this poor wretch seeing himself a little at\r\nliberty, Nature inspired him with hopes of life, and he started away\r\nfrom them, and ran with incredible swiftness along the sands directly\r\ntowards me, I mean towards that part of the coast where my habitation\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nI was dreadfully frightened (that I must acknowledge) when I perceived\r\nhim to run my way, and especially when, as I thought, I saw him pursued\r\nby the whole body; and now I expected that part of my dream was coming\r\nto pass, and that he would certainly take shelter in my grove; but\r\nI could not depend, by any means, upon my dream for the rest of it,\r\nviz., that the other savages would not pursue him thither, and find him\r\nthere. However, I kept my station, and my spirits began to recover when\r\nI found that there was not above three men that followed him; and still\r\nmore was I encouraged when I found that he outstripped them exceedingly\r\nin running, and gained ground of them; so that if he could but hold it\r\nfor half an hour, I saw easily he would fairly get away from them all.\r\n\r\nThere was between them and my castle the creek, which I mentioned often\r\nat the first part of my story, when I landed my cargoes out of the\r\nship; and this I saw plainly he must necessarily swim over, or the poor\r\nwretch would be taken there. But when the savage escaping came thither\r\nhe made nothing of it, though the tide was then up; but plunging in,\r\nswam through in about thirty strokes or thereabouts, landed, and ran\r\non with exceeding strength and swiftness. When the three persons came\r\nto the creek, I found that two of them could swim, but the third could\r\nnot, and that, standing on the other side, he looked at the other,\r\nbut went no farther, and soon after went softly back, which, as it\r\nhappened, was very well for him in the main.\r\n\r\nI observed, that the two who swam were yet more than twice as long\r\nswimming over the creek as the fellow was that fled from them. It came\r\nnow very warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that now was\r\nmy time to get me a servant, and perhaps a companion or assistant, and\r\nthat I was called plainly by Providence to save this poor creature’s\r\nlife. I immediately ran down the ladders with all possible expedition,\r\nfetched my two guns, for they were both but at the foot of the ladders,\r\nas I observed above, and getting up again, with the same haste, to the\r\ntop of the hill, I crossed toward the sea, and having a very short cut,\r\nand all down hill, clapped myself in the way between the pursuers and\r\nthe pursued, hallooing aloud to him that fled, who, looking back, was\r\nat first perhaps as much frightened at me as at them; and I beckoned\r\nwith my hand to him to come back; and, in the meantime, I slowly\r\nadvanced towards the two that followed; then rushing at once upon the\r\nforemost, I knocked him down with the stock of my piece. I was loth to\r\nfire, because I would not have the rest hear; though, at that distance,\r\nit would not have been easily heard, and being out of sight of the\r\nsmoke too, they would not have easily known what to make of it. Having\r\nknocked this fellow down, the other who pursued with him stopped, as if\r\nhe had been frightened, and I advanced apace towards him; but as I came\r\nnearer, I perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, and was fitting\r\nit to shoot at me; so I was then necessitated to shoot at him first,\r\nwhich I did, and killed him at the first shot.\r\n\r\nThe poor savage who fled, but had stopped, though he saw both his\r\nenemies fallen and killed, as he thought, yet was so frightened with\r\nthe fire and noise of my piece, that he stood stock-still, and neither\r\ncame forward nor went backward, though he seemed rather inclined to fly\r\nstill, than to come on.\r\n\r\nI hallooed again to him, and made signs to come forward, which he\r\neasily understood, and came a little way, then stopped again, and then\r\na little farther, and stopped again; and I could then perceive that he\r\nstood trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner, and had just been to\r\nbe killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned him again to come to me,\r\nand gave him all the signs of encouragement that I could think of; and\r\nhe came nearer and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in\r\ntoken of acknowledgment for my saving his life. I smiled at him, and\r\nlooked pleasantly, and beckoned to him to come still nearer. At length\r\nhe came close to me, and then he kneeled down again, kissed the ground,\r\nand laid his head upon the ground, and taking me by the foot, set my\r\nfoot upon his head. This, it seems, was in token of swearing to be my\r\nslave for ever. I took him up, and made much of him, and encouraged him\r\nall I could. But there was more work to do yet; for I perceived the\r\nsavage whom I knocked down was not killed, but stunned with the blow,\r\nand began to come to himself; so I pointed to him, and showing him the\r\nsavage, that he was not dead, upon this he spoke some words to me; and\r\nthough I could not understand them, yet I thought they were pleasant to\r\nhear; for they were the first sound of a man’s voice that I had heard,\r\nmy own excepted, for above twenty-five years. But there was no time for\r\nsuch reflections now. The savage who was knocked down recovered himself\r\nso far as to sit up upon the ground and I perceived that my savage\r\nbegan to be afraid; but when I saw that, I presented my other piece at\r\nthe man, as if I would shoot him. Upon this my savage, for so I call\r\nhim now, made a motion to me to lend him my sword, which hung naked in\r\na belt by my side; so I did. He no sooner had it but he runs to his\r\nenemy, and, at one blow, cut off his head as cleverly, no executioner\r\nin Germany could have done it sooner or better; which I thought very\r\nstrange for one who, I had reason to believe, never saw a sword in his\r\nlife before, except their own wooden swords. However, it seems, as I\r\nlearned afterwards, they make their wooden swords so sharp, so heavy,\r\nand the wood is so hard, that they will cut off heads even with\r\nthem, ay, and arms, and that at one blow too. When he had done this, he\r\ncame laughing to me in sign of triumph, and brought me the sword again,\r\nand with abundance of gestures, which I did not understand, laid it\r\ndown, with the head of the savage that he had killed, just before me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_--and then he kneeled down again, kissed the ground,\r\nand taking me by the foot, set my foot upon his head_”]\r\n\r\nBut that which astonished him most was to know how I had killed the\r\nother Indian so far off; so pointing to him, he made signs to me to\r\nlet him go to him; so I bade him go, as well as I could. When he came\r\nto him, he stood like one amazed, looking at him, turned him first on\r\none side, then on t’other, looked at the wound the bullet had made,\r\nwhich, it seems, was just in his breast, where it had made a hole, and\r\nno great quantity of blood had followed; but he had bled inwardly, for\r\nhe was quite dead. He took up his bow and arrows, and came back; so I\r\nturned to go away, and beckoned to him to follow me making signs to him\r\nthat more might come after them.\r\n\r\nUpon this he signed to me that he should bury them with sand, that\r\nthey might not be seen by the rest if they followed; and so I made\r\nsigns again to him to do so. He fell to work, and in an instant he had\r\nscraped a hole in the sand with his hands big enough to bury the first\r\nin, and then dragged him into it, and covered him, and did so also by\r\nthe other. I believe he had buried them both in a quarter of an hour.\r\nThen calling him away, I carried him, not to my castle, but quite away\r\nto my cave, on the farther part of the island; so I did not let my\r\ndream come to pass in that part, viz., that he came into my grove for\r\nshelter.\r\n\r\nHere I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to eat, and a draught\r\nof water, which I found he was indeed in great distress for, by his\r\nrunning; and having refreshed him, I made signs for him to go lie down\r\nand sleep, pointing to a place where I had laid a great parcel of\r\nrice-straw, and a blanket upon it, which I used to sleep upon myself\r\nsometimes; so the poor creature laid down, and went to sleep.\r\n\r\nHe was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well made, with straight\r\nstrong limbs, not too large, tall, and well-shaped, and, as I reckon,\r\nabout twenty-six years of age. He had a very good countenance, not a\r\nfierce and surly aspect, but seemed to have something very manly in\r\nhis face; and yet he had all the sweetness and softness of an European\r\nin his countenance too, especially when he smiled. His hair was long\r\nand black, not curled like wool; his forehead very high and large; and\r\na great vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The color of\r\nhis skin was not quite black, but very tawny; and yet not of an ugly,\r\nyellow, nauseous tawny, as the Brazilians and Virginians, and other\r\nnatives of America are, but of a bright kind of a dun olive color, that\r\nhad in it something very agreeable, though not very easy to describe.\r\nHis face was round and plump; his nose small, not flat like the\r\nnegroes; a very good mouth, thin lips, and his fine teeth well set, and\r\nwhite as ivory.\r\n\r\nAfter he had slumbered, rather than slept, about half an hour, he\r\nwaked again, and came out of the cave to me, for I had been milking\r\nmy goats, which I had in the enclosure just by. When he espied me, he\r\ncame running to me, laying himself down again upon the ground, with\r\nall the possible signs of an humble, thankful disposition, making\r\nmany antic gestures to show it. At last he lays his head flat upon the\r\nground, close to my foot, and sets my other foot upon his head, as he\r\nhad done before, and after this made all the signs to me of subjection,\r\nservitude, and submission imaginable, to let me know how he would serve\r\nme as long as he lived. I understood him in many things, and let him\r\nknow I was very well pleased with him. In a little time I began to\r\nspeak to him, and teach him to speak to me; and, first, I made him know\r\nhis name should be Friday, which was the day I saved his life. I called\r\nhim so for the memory of the time. I likewise taught him to say master,\r\nand then let him know that was to be my name. I likewise taught him to\r\nsay Yes and No, and to know the meaning of them. I gave him some milk\r\nin an earthen pot, and let him see me drink it before him, and sop my\r\nbread in it; and I gave him a cake of bread to do the like, which he\r\nquickly complied with, and made signs that it was very good for him.\r\n\r\nI kept there with him all that night; but as soon as it was day, I\r\nbeckoned to him to come with me, and let him know I would give him\r\nsome clothes; at which he seemed very glad, for he was stark naked.\r\nAs we went by the place where he had buried the two men, he pointed\r\nexactly to the place, and showed me the marks that he had made to find\r\nthem again, making signs to me that we should dig them up again, and\r\neat them. At this I appeared very angry, expressed my abhorrence of\r\nit, made as if I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned with\r\nmy hand to him to come away; which he did immediately, with great\r\nsubmission. I then led him up to the top of the hill, to see if his\r\nenemies were gone; and pulling out my glass, I looked, and saw plainly\r\nthe place where they had been, but no appearance of them or of their\r\ncanoes; so that it was plain that they were gone, and had left their\r\ntwo comrades behind them, without any search after them.\r\n\r\nBut I was not content with this discovery; but having now more courage,\r\nand consequently more curiosity, I took my man Friday with me, giving\r\nhim the sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at his back, which\r\nI found he could use very dexterously, making him carry one gun for\r\nme, and I two for myself, and away we marched to the place where\r\nthese creatures had been; for I had a mind now to get some fuller\r\nintelligence of them. When I came to the place, my very blood ran\r\nchill in my veins, and my heart sunk within me, at the horror of the\r\nspectacle. Indeed, it was a dreadful sight, at least it was so to me,\r\nthough Friday made nothing of it. The place was covered with human\r\nbones, the ground dyed with their blood, great pieces of flesh left\r\nhere and there, half-eaten, mangled, and scorched; and, in short,\r\nall the tokens of the triumphant feast they had been making there,\r\nafter a victory over their enemies. I saw three skulls, five hands,\r\nand the bones of three or four legs and feet, and abundance of other\r\nparts of the bodies; and Friday, by his signs, made me understand that\r\nthey brought over four prisoners to feast upon; that three of them\r\nwere eaten up, and that he, pointing to himself, was the fourth; that\r\nthere had been a great battle between them and their next king, whose\r\nsubjects it seems he had been one of, and that they had taken a great\r\nnumber of prisoners; all of which were carried to several places by\r\nthose that had taken them in the fight, in order to feast upon them, as\r\nwas done here by these wretches upon those they brought hither.\r\n\r\nI caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, and whatever\r\nremained, and lay them together on a heap, and make a great fire upon\r\nit, and burn them all to ashes. I found Friday had still a hankering\r\nstomach after some of the flesh, and was still a cannibal in his\r\nnature; but I discovered so much abhorrence at the very thoughts of it,\r\nand at the least appearance of it, that he durst not discover it; for I\r\nhad, by some means, let him know that I would kill him if he offered it.\r\n\r\nWhen we had done this we came back to our castle, and there I fell to\r\nwork for my man Friday; and, first of all, I gave him a pair of linen\r\ndrawers, which I had out of the poor gunner’s chest I mentioned, and\r\nwhich I found in the wreck; and which, with a little alteration, fitted\r\nhim very well. Then I made him a jerkin of goat’s skin, as well as my\r\nskill would allow, and I was now grown a tolerable good tailor; and I\r\ngave him a cap, which I had made of a hare-skin, very convenient and\r\nfashionable enough; and thus he was clothed for the present tolerably\r\nwell, and was mighty well pleased to see himself almost as well clothed\r\nas his master. It is true he went awkwardly in these things at first;\r\nwearing the drawers was very awkward to him, and the sleeves of the\r\nwaistcoat galled his shoulders, and the inside of his arms; but a\r\nlittle easing them where he complained they hurt him, and using himself\r\nto them, at length he took to them very well.\r\n\r\nThe next day after I came home to my hutch with him, I began to\r\nconsider where I should lodge him. And that I might do well for him,\r\nand yet be perfectly easy myself, I made a little tent for him in the\r\nvacant place between my two fortifications, in the inside of the last\r\nand in the outside of the first; and as there was a door or entrance\r\nthere into my cave, I made a formal framed door-case, and a door to it\r\nof boards, and set it up in the passage, a little within the entrance;\r\nand causing the door to open on the inside, I barred it up in the\r\nnight, taking in my ladders too; so that Friday could in no way come at\r\nme in the inside of my innermost wall without making so much noise in\r\ngetting over, that it must needs waken me; for my first wall had now a\r\ncomplete roof over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and leaning\r\nup to the side of the hill, which was again laid cross with smaller\r\nsticks instead of laths, and then thatched over a great thickness with\r\nthe rice-straw, which was strong, like reeds; and at the hole or place\r\nwhich was left to go in or out by the ladder, I had placed a kind of\r\ntrap-door, which, if it had been attempted on the outside, would not\r\nhave opened at all, but would have fallen down, and made a great noise;\r\nand as to weapons, I took them all into my side every night.\r\n\r\nBut I needed none of all this precaution; for never man had a more\r\nfaithful, loving, sincere servant than Friday was to me; without\r\npassions, sullenness, or designs, perfectly obliged and engaged; his\r\nvery affections were tied to me, like those of a child to a father;\r\nand I dare say he would have sacrificed his life for the saving mine,\r\nupon any occasion whatsoever. The many testimonies he gave me of this\r\nput it out of doubt, and soon convinced me that I needed to use no\r\nprecautions as to my safety on his account.\r\n\r\nThis frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with wonder, that\r\nhowever it had pleased God, in His providence, and in the government\r\nof the works of His hands, to take from so great a part of the world\r\nof His creatures the best uses to which their faculties and the powers\r\nof their souls are adapted, yet that He has bestowed upon them the\r\nsame powers, the same reason, the same affections, the same sentiments\r\nof kindness and obligation, the same passions and resentments of\r\nwrongs, the same sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the\r\ncapacities of doing good, and receiving good, that He has given to us;\r\nand that when He pleases to offer to them occasions of exerting these,\r\nthey are as ready, nay, more ready, to apply them to the right uses for\r\nwhich they were bestowed than we are. And this made me very melancholy\r\nsometimes, in reflecting, as the several occasions presented, how\r\nmean a use we make of all these, even though we have these powers\r\nenlightened by the great lamp of instruction, the Spirit of God, and by\r\nthe knowledge of His Word added to our understanding; and why it has\r\npleased God to hide the life saving knowledge from so many millions of\r\nsouls, who, if I might judge by this poor savage, would make a much\r\nbetter use of it than we did.\r\n\r\nFrom hence, I sometimes was led too far to invade the sovereignty\r\nof Providence, and as it were arraign the justice of so arbitrary a\r\ndisposition of things, that should hide that light from some, and\r\nreveal it to others, and yet expect a like duty from both. But I shut\r\nit up, and checked my thoughts with this conclusion: first, that we\r\ndid not know by what light and law these should be condemned; but that\r\nas God was necessarily, and by the nature of His being, infinitely\r\nholy and just, so it could not be but that if these creatures were all\r\nsentenced to absence from Himself, it was on account of sinning against\r\nthat light, which, as the Scripture says, was a law to themselves, and\r\nby such rules as their consciences would acknowledge to be just, though\r\nthe foundation was not discovered to us; and, second, that still, as we\r\nare all the clay in the hand of the potter, no vessel could say to Him,\r\n“Why hast Thou formed me thus?”\r\n\r\nBut to return to my new companion. I was greatly delighted with him,\r\nand made it my business to teach him everything that was proper to make\r\nhim useful, handy, and helpful; but especially to make him speak, and\r\nunderstand me when I spake. And he was the aptest scholar that ever\r\nwas; and particularly was so merry, so constantly diligent, and so\r\npleased when he could but understand me, or make me understand him,\r\nthat it was very pleasant to me to talk to him. And now my life began\r\nto be so easy, that I began to say to myself, that could I but have\r\nbeen safe from more savages, I cared not if I was never to remove from\r\nthe place while I lived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n_Robinson Instructs and Civilizes His Man Friday and Endeavors to Give\r\nHim an Idea of Christianity_\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter I had been two or three days returned to my castle, I thought\r\nthat, in order to bring Friday off from his horrid way of feeding, and\r\nfrom the relish of a cannibal’s stomach, I ought to let him taste other\r\nflesh; so I took him out with me one morning to the woods. I went,\r\nindeed, intending to kill a kid out of my own flock, and bring him\r\nhome and dress it; but as I was going, I saw a she-goat lying down in\r\nthe shade, and two young kids sitting by her. I caught hold of Friday.\r\n“Hold,” says I, “stand still,” and made signs to him not to stir.\r\nImmediately I presented my piece, shot and killed one of the kids. The\r\npoor creature, who had, at a distance indeed, seen me kill the savage\r\nhis enemy, but did not know, or could imagine, how it was done, was\r\nsensibly surprised, trembled and shook, and looked so amazed, that I\r\nthought he would have sunk down. He did not see the kid I had shot at,\r\nor perceive I had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat to feel if he\r\nwas not wounded; and, as I found presently, thought I was resolved to\r\nkill him; for he came and kneeled down to me, and embracing my knees,\r\nsaid a great many things I did not understand; but I could easily see\r\nthat the meaning was to pray me not to kill him.\r\n\r\nI soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no harm; and\r\ntaking him up by the hand, laughed at him, and pointing to the kid\r\nwhich I had killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he did;\r\nand while he was wondering, and looking to see how the creature was\r\nkilled, I loaded my gun again; and by and by I saw a great fowl, like\r\na hawk, sit upon a tree, within shot; so, to let Friday understand\r\na little what I would do, I called him to me again, pointing at the\r\nfowl, which was indeed a parrot, though I thought it had been a hawk;\r\nI say, pointing to the parrot, and to my gun, and to the ground under\r\nthe parrot, to let him see I would make it fall, I made him understand\r\nthat I would shoot and kill that bird. Accordingly I fired, and bade\r\nhim look, and immediately he saw the parrot fall. He stood like one\r\nfrightened again, notwithstanding all I had said to him; and I found he\r\nwas the more amazed, because he did not see me put anything into the\r\ngun, but thought that there must be some wonderful fund of death and\r\ndestruction in that thing, able to kill man, beast, bird, or anything\r\nnear or far off; and the astonishment this created in him was such as\r\ncould not wear off for a long time; and I believe, if I would have let\r\nhim, he would have worshipped me and my gun. As for the gun itself,\r\nhe would not so much as touch it for several days after; but would\r\nspeak to it, and talk to it, as if it had answered him, when he was by\r\nhimself; which, as I afterwards learned of him, was to desire it not to\r\nkill him.\r\n\r\nWell, after his astonishment was a little over at this, I pointed to\r\nhim to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which he did, but stayed\r\nsome time; for the parrot, not being quite dead, fluttered a good way\r\noff from the place where she fell. However, he found her, took her up,\r\nand brought her to me; and as I had perceived his ignorance about the\r\ngun before, I took this advantage to charge the gun again, and not let\r\nhim see me do it, that I might be ready for any other mark that might\r\npresent. But nothing more offered at that time; so I brought home the\r\nkid, and the same evening I took the skin off, and cut it out as well\r\nas I could; and having a pot for that purpose, I boiled or stewed some\r\nof the flesh, and made some very good broth; and after I had begun to\r\neat some, I gave some to my man, who seemed very glad of it, and liked\r\nit very well; but that which was strangest to him, was to see me eat\r\nsalt with it. He made a sign to me that the salt was not good to eat,\r\nand putting a little into his own mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, and\r\nwould spit and sputter at it, washing his mouth with fresh water after\r\nit. On the other hand, I took some meat in my mouth without salt, and I\r\npretended to spit and sputter for want of salt, as fast as he had done\r\nat the salt. But it would not do; he would never care for salt with his\r\nmeat or in his broth; at least, not a great while, and then but a very\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nHaving thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was resolved to\r\nfeast him the next day with roasting a piece of the kid. This I did by\r\nhanging it before the fire in a string, as I had seen many people do in\r\nEngland, setting two poles up, one on each side of the fire, and one\r\ncross on the top, and tying the string to the cross stick, letting the\r\nmeat turn continually.\r\n\r\nThis Friday admired very much. But when he came to taste the flesh, he\r\ntook so many ways to tell me how well he liked it, that I could not but\r\nunderstand him; and at last he told me he would never eat man’s flesh\r\nany more, which I was very glad to hear.\r\n\r\nThe next day I set him to work to beating some corn out, and sifting\r\nit in the manner I used to do, as I observed before; and he soon\r\nunderstood how to do it as well as I, especially after he had seen what\r\nthe meaning of it was, and that it was to make bread of; for after that\r\nI let him see me make my bread, and bake it too; and in a little time\r\nFriday was able to do all the work for me, as well as I could do it\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nI began now to consider that, having two mouths to feed instead of one,\r\nI must provide more ground for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity\r\nof corn than I used to do; so I marked out a larger piece of land, and\r\nbegan the fence in the same manner as before, in which Friday not only\r\nworked very willingly and very hard, but did it very cheerfully; and\r\nI told him what it was for; that it was for corn to make more bread,\r\nbecause he was now with me, and that I might have enough for him and\r\nmyself too. He appeared very sensible of that part, and let me know\r\nthat he thought I had much more labor upon me on his account, than I\r\nhad for myself; and that he would work the harder for me, if I would\r\ntell him what to do.\r\n\r\nThis was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this place.\r\nFriday began to talk pretty well, and understand the names of almost\r\neverything I had occasion to call for, and of every place I had to send\r\nhim to, and talk a great deal to me; so that, in short, I began now to\r\nhave some use for my tongue again, which, indeed, I had very little\r\noccasion for before, that is to say, about speech. Besides the pleasure\r\nof talking to him, I had a singular satisfaction in the fellow himself.\r\nHis simple, unfeigned honesty appeared to me more and more every day,\r\nand I began really to love the creature; and, on his side, I believed\r\nhe loved me more than it was possible for him ever to love anything\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nI had a mind once to try if he had any hankering inclination for his\r\nown country again; and having taught him English so well that he could\r\nanswer me almost any questions, I asked him whether the nation that he\r\nbelonged to never conquered in battle? At which he smiled, and said,\r\n“Yes, yes, we always fight the better”; that is, he meant, always get\r\nthe better in fight; and so we began the following discourse: “You\r\nalways fight the better,” said I. “How came you to be taken prisoner\r\nthen, Friday?”\r\n\r\n_Friday._ My nation beat much for all that.\r\n\r\n_Master._ How beat? If your nation beat them, how came you to be taken?\r\n\r\n_Friday._ They more many than my nation in the place where me was; they\r\ntake one, two, three, and me. My nation overbeat them in the yonder\r\nplace, where me no was: there my nation take one, two, great thousand.\r\n\r\n_Master._ But why did not your side recover you from the hands of your\r\nenemies then?\r\n\r\n_Friday._ They run one, two, three and me, and make go in the canoe; my\r\nnation have no canoe that time.\r\n\r\n_Master._ Well, Friday, and what does your nation do with the men they\r\ntake? Do they carry them away and eat them, as these did?\r\n\r\n_Friday._ Yes, my nation eat mans too; eat all up.\r\n\r\n_Master._ Where do they carry them?\r\n\r\n_Friday._ Go to other place, where they think.\r\n\r\n_Master._ Do they come hither?\r\n\r\n_Friday._ Yes, yes, they come hither; come other else place.\r\n\r\n_Master._ Have you been here with them?\r\n\r\n_Friday._ Yes, I been here. (_Points to the N.W. side of the island,\r\nwhich, it seems, was their side._)\r\n\r\nBy this I understood that my man Friday had formerly been among the\r\nsavages who used to come on shore on the farther part of the island, on\r\nthe same man-eating occasions that he was now brought for; and, some\r\ntime after, when I took the courage to carry him to that side, being\r\nthe same I formerly mentioned, he presently knew the place, and told\r\nme he was there once when they ate up twenty men, two women, and one\r\nchild. He could not tell twenty in English, but he numbered them by\r\nlaying so many stones in a row, and pointing to me to tell them over.\r\n\r\nI have told this passage, because it introduces what follows; that\r\nafter I had had this discourse with him, I asked him how far it was\r\nfrom our island to the shore, and whether the canoes were not often\r\nlost. He told me there was no danger, no canoes ever lost; but that,\r\nafter a little way out to the sea, there was a current and a wind,\r\nalways one way in the morning, the other in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThis I understood to be no more than the sets of the tide, as going\r\nout or coming in; but I afterwards understood it was occasioned by the\r\ngreat draught and reflux of the mighty river Orinoco, in the mouth or\r\nthe gulf of which river, as I found afterwards, our island lay; and\r\nthis land which I perceived to the W. and N.W. was the great island\r\nTrinidad, on the north point of the mouth of the river. I asked Friday\r\na thousand questions about the country, the inhabitants, the sea, the\r\ncoast, and what nations were near. He told me all he knew, with the\r\ngreatest openness imaginable. I asked him the names of the several\r\nnations of his sort of people, but could get no other name than Caribs;\r\nfrom whence I easily understood that these were the Caribbees, which\r\nour maps place on the part of America which reaches from the mouth of\r\nthe river Orinoco to Guiana, and onwards to St. Martha. He told me that\r\nup a great way beyond the moon, that was, beyond the setting of the\r\nmoon, which must be W. from their country, there dwelt white-bearded\r\nmen, like me, and pointed to my great whiskers, which I mentioned\r\nbefore; and that they had killed much mans, that was his word; by all\r\nwhich I understood he meant the Spaniards, whose cruelties in America\r\nhad been spread over the whole countries, and was remembered by all the\r\nnations from father to son.\r\n\r\nI inquired if he could tell me how I might come from this island and\r\nget among those white men. He told me, “Yes, yes, I might go in two\r\ncanoe.” I could not understand what he meant, or make him describe to\r\nme what he meant by two canoe; till at last, with great difficulty, I\r\nfound he meant it must be in a large great boat, as big as two canoes.\r\n\r\nThis part of Friday’s discourse began to relish with me very well; and\r\nfrom this time I entertained some hopes that, one time or other, I\r\nmight find an opportunity to make my escape from this place, and that\r\nthis poor savage might be a means to help me to do it.\r\n\r\nDuring the long time that Friday had now been with me, and that he\r\nbegan to speak to me, and understand me, I was not wanting to lay a\r\nfoundation of religious knowledge in his mind; particularly I asked him\r\none time, Who made him? The poor creature did not understand me at all,\r\nbut thought I had asked who was his father. But I took it by another\r\nhandle, and asked him who made the sea, the ground we walked on, and\r\nthe hills and woods? He told me it was one old Benamuckee, that lived\r\nbeyond all. He could describe nothing of this great person, but that he\r\nwas very old, much older, he said, than the sea or the land, than the\r\nmoon or the stars. I asked him then, if this old person had made all\r\nthings, why did not all things worship him? He looked very grave, and\r\nwith a perfect look of innocence said, “All things do say O to him.”\r\nI asked him if the people who die in his country went away anywhere?\r\nHe said, “Yes, they all went to Benamuckee.” Then I asked him whether\r\nthese they ate up went thither too? He said “Yes.”\r\n\r\nFrom these things I began to instruct him in the knowledge of the true\r\nGod. I told him that the great Maker of all things lived up there,\r\npointing up towards heaven; that He governs the world by the same power\r\nand providence by which He made it; that He was omnipotent, could do\r\neverything for us, give everything to us, take everything from us; and\r\nthus, by degrees, I opened his eyes. He listened with great attention,\r\nand received with pleasure the notion of Jesus Christ being sent to\r\nredeem us, and of the manner of making our prayers to God, and His\r\nbeing able to hear us, even into heaven. He told me one day that if our\r\nGod could hear us up beyond the sun, He must needs be a greater God\r\nthan their Benamuckee, who lived but a little way off, and yet could\r\nnot hear till they went up to the great mountains where he dwelt to\r\nspeak to him. I asked him if he ever went thither to speak to him? He\r\nsaid, No; they never went that were young men; none went thither but\r\nthe old men, whom he called their Oowokakee, that is, as I made him\r\nexplain it to me, their religious, or clergy; and that they went to\r\nsay O (so he called saying prayers), and then came back, and told them\r\nwhat Benamuckee said. But this I observed that there is priestcraft\r\neven amongst the most blinded, ignorant pagans in the world; and the\r\npolicy of making a secret religion in order to preserve the veneration\r\nof the people to the clergy is not only to be found in the Roman, but\r\nperhaps among all religions in the world, even among the most brutish\r\nand barbarous savages.\r\n\r\nI endeavored to clear up this fraud to my man Friday, and told him that\r\nthe pretense of their old men going up to the mountains to say O to\r\ntheir god Benamuckee was a cheat, and their bringing word from thence\r\nwhat he said was much more so; that if they met with any answer, or\r\nspoke with any one there, it must be with an evil spirit; and then I\r\nentered into a long discourse with him about the devil, the original\r\nof him, his rebellion against God, his enmity to man, the reason\r\nof it, his setting himself up in the dark parts of the world to be\r\nworshipped instead of God, and as God, and the many stratagems he made\r\nuse of to delude mankind to their ruin; how he had a secret access\r\nto our passions and to our affections, to adapt his snares so to our\r\ninclinations, as to cause us even to be our own tempters, and to run\r\nupon our destruction by our own choice.\r\n\r\nI found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in his mind about\r\nthe devil, as it was about the being of a God. Nature assisted all my\r\narguments to evidence to him even the necessity of a great First Cause\r\nand overruling, governing Power, a secret directing Providence, and of\r\nthe equity and justice of paying homage to Him that made us, and the\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nBut there appeared nothing of all this in the notion of an evil\r\nspirit; of his original, his being, his nature, and above all, of his\r\ninclination to do evil, and to draw us in to do so too; and the poor\r\ncreature puzzled me once in such a manner by a question merely natural\r\nand innocent, that I scarce knew what to say to him. I had been talking\r\na great deal to him of the power of God, His omnipotence, His dreadful\r\naversion to sin, His being a consuming fire to the workers of iniquity;\r\nhow, as He had made us all, He could destroy us and all the world in a\r\nmoment; and he listened with great seriousness to me all the while.\r\n\r\nAfter this I had been telling him how the devil was God’s enemy in the\r\nhearts of men, and used all his malice and skill to defeat the good\r\ndesigns of Providence, and to ruin the kingdom of Christ in the world,\r\nand the like. “Well,” says Friday, “but you say God is so strong, so\r\ngreat; is He no much strong, much might as the devil?” “Yes, yes,” says\r\nI, “Friday, God is stronger than the devil; God is above the devil, and\r\ntherefore we pray to God to tread him down under our feet, and enable\r\nus to resist his temptation, and quench his fiery darts.” “But,” says\r\nhe again, “if God much strong, much might as the devil, why God no kill\r\nthe devil, so make him no more do wicked?”\r\n\r\nI was strangely surprised at his question; and after all, though I was\r\nnow an old man, yet I was but a young doctor, and ill enough qualified\r\nfor a casuist, or a solver of difficulties; and at first I could not\r\ntell what to say; so I pretended not to hear him, and asked him what\r\nhe said? But he was too earnest for an answer to forget his question,\r\nso that he repeated it in the very same broken words as above. By this\r\ntime I had recovered myself a little, and I said, “God will at last\r\npunish him severely; he is reserved for the judgment, and is to be cast\r\ninto the bottomless pit, to dwell with everlasting fire.” This did not\r\nsatisfy Friday; but he returned upon me, repeating my words “Reserve at\r\nlast! me no understand; but why not kill the devil now? not kill great\r\nago?” “You may as well ask me,” said I, “why God does not kill you and\r\nI, when we do wicked things here that offend Him; we are preserved to\r\nrepent and be pardoned.” He muses awhile at this. “Well, well,” says\r\nhe, mighty affectionately, “that well; so you, I, devil, all wicked,\r\nall preserve, repent, God pardon all.” Here I was run down again by him\r\nto the last degree, and it was a testimony to me how the mere notions\r\nof nature, though they will guide reasonable creatures to the knowledge\r\nof a God, and of a worship or homage due to the supreme being of God,\r\nas the consequence of our nature, yet nothing but Divine revelation can\r\nform the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of a redemption purchased for\r\nus, of a Mediator of the new covenant, and of an Intercessor at the\r\nfootstool of God’s throne; I say, nothing but a revelation from heaven\r\ncan form these in the soul, and that therefore the Gospel of our Lord\r\nand Savior Jesus Christ, I mean the Word of God, and the Spirit of God,\r\npromised for the guide and sanctifier of His people, are the absolutely\r\nnecessary instructors of the souls of men in the saving knowledge of\r\nGod, and the means of salvation.\r\n\r\nI therefore diverted the present discourse between me and my man,\r\nrising up hastily, as upon some sudden occasion of going out; then\r\nsending him for something a good way off, I seriously prayed to\r\nGod that He would enable me to instruct savingly this poor savage,\r\nassisting, by His Spirit, the heart of the poor ignorant creature to\r\nreceive the light of the knowledge of God in Christ, reconciling him to\r\nHimself, and would guide me to speak so to him from the Word of God as\r\nhis conscience might be convinced, his eyes opened, and his soul saved.\r\nWhen he came again to me, I entered into a long discourse with him upon\r\nthe subject of the redemption of man by the Savior of the world, and of\r\nthe doctrine of the Gospel preached from heaven, viz., of repentance\r\ntowards God, and faith in our blessed Lord Jesus. I then explained to\r\nhim as well as I could why our blessed Redeemer took not on Him the\r\nnature of angels, but the seed of Abraham; and how, for that reason,\r\nthe fallen angels had no share in the redemption; that He came only to\r\nthe lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the like.\r\n\r\nI had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge in all the methods I\r\ntook for this poor creature’s instruction, and must acknowledge, what I\r\nbelieve all that act upon the same principle will find, that in laying\r\nthings open to him, I really informed and instructed myself in many\r\nthings that either I did not know, or had not fully considered before,\r\nbut which occurred naturally to my mind upon my searching into them\r\nfor the information of this poor savage. And I had more affection in\r\nmy inquiry after things upon this occasion than ever I felt before;\r\nso that whether this poor wild wretch was the better for me or no, I\r\nhad great reason to be thankful that ever he came to me. My grief set\r\nlighter upon me, my habitation grew comfortable to me beyond measure;\r\nand when I reflected, that in this solitary life which I had been\r\nconfined to, I had not only been moved myself to look up to heaven,\r\nand to seek to the Hand that had brought me there, but was now to be\r\nmade an instrument, under Providence, to save the life, and, for aught\r\nI know, the soul of a poor savage, and bring him to the true knowledge\r\nof religion, and of the Christian doctrine, that he might know Christ\r\nJesus, to know whom is life eternal;--I say, when I reflected upon\r\nall these things, a secret joy ran through every part of my soul, and\r\nI frequently rejoiced that ever I was brought to this place, which I\r\nhad so often thought the most dreadful of all afflictions that could\r\npossibly have befallen me.\r\n\r\nIn this thankful frame I continued all the remainder of my time, and\r\nthe conversation which employed the hours between Friday and me was\r\nsuch, as made the three years which we lived there together perfectly\r\nand completely happy, if any such thing as complete happiness can be\r\nformed in a sublunary state. The savage was now a good Christian, a\r\nmuch better than I; though I have reason to hope, and bless God for it,\r\nthat we were equally penitent, and comforted, restored penitents. We\r\nhad here the Word of God to read, and no farther off from His Spirit to\r\ninstruct than if we had been in England.\r\n\r\nI always applied myself to reading the Scripture, to let him know,\r\nas well as I could, the meaning of what I read; and he again, by his\r\nserious inquiries and questions, made me, as I said before, a much\r\nbetter scholar in the Scripture-knowledge than I should ever have\r\nbeen by my own private mere reading. Another thing I cannot refrain\r\nfrom observing here also, from experience in this retired part of my\r\nlife, viz., how infinite and inexpressible a blessing it is that the\r\nknowledge of God, and of the doctrine of salvation by Christ Jesus, is\r\nso plainly laid down in the Word of God, so easy to be received and\r\nunderstood; that as the bare reading the Scripture made me capable of\r\nunderstanding enough of my duty to carry me directly on to the great\r\nwork of repentance for my sins, and laying hold of a Savior for life\r\nand salvation, to a stated reformation in practice, and obedience to\r\nall God’s commands, and this without any teacher or instructor (I\r\nmean human); so the same plain instruction sufficiently served to\r\nthe enlightening this savage creature, and bringing him to be such a\r\nChristian, as I have known few equal to him in my life.\r\n\r\nAs to all the disputes, wranglings, strife, and contention which has\r\nhappened in the world about religion, whether niceties in doctrines,\r\nor schemes of Church government, they were all perfectly useless to\r\nus; as, for aught I can yet see, they have been to all the rest in the\r\nworld. We had the sure guide to heaven, viz., the Word of God; and we\r\nhad, blessed be God, comfortable views of the Spirit of God teaching\r\nand instructing us by His Word, leading us into all truth, and making\r\nus both willing and obedient to the instruction of His Word; and I\r\ncannot see the least use that the greatest knowledge of the disputed\r\npoints in religion, which have made such confusions in the world would\r\nhave been to us if we could have obtained it. But I must go on with the\r\nhistorical part of things and take every part in its order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n_Robinson and Friday Build a Canoe to Carry them to Friday’s\r\nCountry--Their Scheme Prevented by the Arrival of a Party of Savages_\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Friday and I became more intimately acquainted and that he could\r\nunderstand almost all I said to him, and speak fluently, though in\r\nbroken English, to me, I acquainted him with my own story, or at least\r\nso much of it as related to my coming into the place; how I had lived\r\nthere, and how long. I let him into the mystery, for such it was to\r\nhim, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to shoot; I gave him a\r\nknife, which he was wonderfully delighted with, and I made him a belt,\r\nwith a frog hanging to it, such as in England we wear hangers in; and\r\nin the frog, instead of a hanger, I gave him a hatchet, which was not\r\nonly as good a weapon, in some cases, but much more useful upon other\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nI described to him the country of Europe, and particularly England,\r\nwhich I came from; how we lived, how we worshipped God, how we behaved\r\nto one another, and how we traded in ships to all parts of the world.\r\nI gave him an account of the wreck which I had been on board of, and\r\nshowed him, as near as I could, the place where she lay; but she was\r\nall beaten in pieces before, and gone.\r\n\r\nI showed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost when we escaped, and\r\nwhich I could not stir with my whole strength then, but was now fallen\r\nalmost all to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday stood musing a\r\ngreat while, and said nothing. I asked him what it was he studied upon.\r\nAt last says he, “Me see such boat like come to place at my nation.”\r\n\r\nI did not understand him a good while; but at last, when I had examined\r\nfarther into it, I understood by him that a boat such as that had been,\r\ncame on shore upon the country where he lived; that is, as he explained\r\nit, was driven thither by stress of weather.\r\n\r\nI presently imagined that some European ship must have been cast away\r\nupon their coast, and the boat might get loose and drive ashore; but\r\nwas so dull, that I never once thought of men making escape from a\r\nwreck thither, much less whence they might come; so I only inquired\r\nafter a description of the boat.\r\n\r\nFriday described the boat to me well enough; but brought me better to\r\nunderstand him when he added with some warmth, “We save the white mans\r\nfrom drown.” Then I presently asked him if there was any white mans, as\r\nhe called them, in the boat. “Yes,” he said, “the boat full of white\r\nmans.” I asked him how many. He told upon his fingers seventeen. I\r\nasked him then what became of them. He told me, “They live, they dwell\r\nat my nation.”\r\n\r\nThis put new thoughts into my head; for I presently imagined that these\r\nmight be the men belonging to the ship that was cast away in sight of\r\nmy island, as I now call it; and who, after the ship was struck on the\r\nrock, and they saw her inevitably lost, had saved themselves in their\r\nboat, and were landed upon that wild shore among the savages.\r\n\r\nUpon this I inquired of him more critically what was become of them. He\r\nassured me they lived still there; that they had been there about four\r\nyears; that the savages let them alone, and gave them victuals to live.\r\nI asked him how it came to pass they did not kill them, and eat them.\r\nHe said, “No, they make brother with them;” that is, as I understood\r\nhim, a truce; and then he added, “They no eat mans but when make the\r\nwar fight;” that is to say, they never eat any men but such as come to\r\nfight with them and are taken in battle.\r\n\r\nIt was after this some considerable time, that being on the top of the\r\nhill, at the east side of the island (from whence, as I have said,\r\nI had in a clear day discovered the main or continent of America),\r\nFriday, the weather being very serene, looks very earnestly towards the\r\nmainland, and, in a kind of surprise, falls a-jumping and dancing, and\r\ncalls out to me, for I was at some distance from him. I asked him what\r\nwas the matter? “O joy!” says he, “O glad! there see my country, there\r\nmy nation!”\r\n\r\nI observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared in his face,\r\nand his eyes sparkled, and his countenance discovered a strange\r\neagerness, as if he had a mind to be in his own country again; and this\r\nobservation of mine put a great many thoughts into me, which made me at\r\nfirst not so easy about my new man Friday as I was before; and I made\r\nno doubt but that if Friday could get back to his own nation again, he\r\nwould not only forget all his religion, but all his obligation to me;\r\nand would be forward enough to give his countrymen an account of me,\r\nand come back perhaps with a hundred or two of them, and make a feast\r\nupon me, at which he might be as merry as he used to be with those of\r\nhis enemies, when they were taken in war.\r\n\r\nBut I wronged the poor honest creature very much, for which I was very\r\nsorry afterwards. However, as my jealousy increased, and held me some\r\nweeks, I was a little more circumspect, and not so familiar and kind to\r\nhim as before; in which I was certainly in the wrong too, the honest,\r\ngrateful creature having no thought about it but what consisted with\r\nthe best principles, both as a religious Christian and as a grateful\r\nfriend, as appeared afterwards to my full satisfaction.\r\n\r\nWhile my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was every day\r\npumping him, to see if he would discover any of the new thoughts which\r\nI suspected were in him; but I found everything he said was so honest\r\nand so innocent, that I could find nothing to nourish my suspicion;\r\nand, in spite of all my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely his\r\nown again, nor did he in the least perceive that I was uneasy, and\r\ntherefore I could not suspect him of deceit.\r\n\r\nOne day, walking up the same hill, but the weather being hazy at\r\nsea, so that we could not see the continent, I called to him, and\r\nsaid, “Friday, do not you wish yourself in your own country, your own\r\nnation?” “Yes,” he said, “I be much O glad to be at my own nation.”\r\n“What would you do there?” said I. “Would you turn wild again, eat\r\nmen’s flesh again, and be a savage as you were before?” He looked\r\nfull of concern, and shaking his head said, “No, no; Friday tell them\r\nto live good; tell them to pray God; tell them to eat corn-bread,\r\ncattle-flesh, milk, no eat man again.” “Why then,” said I to him,\r\n“they will kill you.” He looked grave at that, and then said, “No,\r\nthey no kill me, they willing love learn.” He meant by this they would\r\nbe willing to learn. He added, they learned much of the bearded mans\r\nthat come in the boat. Then I asked him if he would go back to them?\r\nHe smiled at that, and told me he could not swim so far. I told him I\r\nwould make a canoe for him. He told me he would go, if I would go with\r\nhim. “I go?” says I; “why, they will eat me if I come there.” “No, no,”\r\nsays he, “me make they no eat you; me make they much love you.” He\r\nmeant, he would tell them how I had killed his enemies, and saved his\r\nlife, and so he would make them love me. Then he told me, as well as he\r\ncould, how kind they were to seventeen white men, or bearded men, as he\r\ncalled them, who came on shore there in distress.\r\n\r\nFrom this time I confess I had a mind to venture over, and see if I\r\ncould possibly join with these bearded men, who, I made no doubt, were\r\nSpaniards or Portuguese; not doubting that, if I could, we might find\r\nsome method to escape from thence, being upon the continent, and a good\r\ncompany together, better than I could from an island forty miles off\r\nthe shore, and alone, without help. So, after some days, I took Friday\r\nto work again, by way of discourse, and told him I would give him a\r\nboat to go back to his own nation; and accordingly I carried him to my\r\nfrigate, which lay on the other side of the island, and having cleared\r\nit of water, for I always kept it sunk in the water, I brought it out,\r\nshowed it him, and we both went into it.\r\n\r\nI found he was a most dexterous fellow at managing it, and would make\r\nit go almost as swift and fast again as I could. So when he was in I\r\nsaid to him, “Well now, Friday, shall we go to your nation?” He looked\r\nvery dull at my saying so, which, it seems, was because he thought the\r\nboat too small to go so far. I told him then I had a bigger; so the\r\nnext day I went to the place where the first boat lay which I had made,\r\nbut which I could not get into the water. He said that was big enough;\r\nbut then, as I had taken no care of it, and it had lain two or three\r\nand twenty years there, the sun had split and dried it, that it was in\r\na manner rotten. Friday told me such a boat would do very well, and\r\nwould carry “much enough victual, drink, bread;” that was his way of\r\ntalking.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design of going\r\nover with him to the continent, that I told him we would go and make\r\none as big as that, and he should go home in it. He answered not one\r\nword, but looked very grave and sad. I asked him what was the matter\r\nwith him? He asked me again thus, “Why you angry mad with Friday?\r\nwhat me done?” I asked him what he meant. I told him I was not angry\r\nwith him at all. “No angry! no angry!” says he, repeating the words\r\nseveral times. “Why send Friday home away to my nation?” “Why,” says\r\nI, “Friday, did you not say you wished you were there?” “Yes, yes,”\r\nsays he, “wish be both there, no wish Friday there, no master there.”\r\nIn a word, he would not think of going there without me. “I go there,\r\nFriday!” says I; “what shall I do there?” He turned very quick upon me\r\nat this: “You do great deal much good,” says he; “you teach wild mans\r\nto be good, sober, tame mans; you tell them know God, pray God, and\r\nlive new life.” “Alas! Friday,” says I, “thou knowest not what thou\r\nsayest. I am but an ignorant man myself.” “Yes, yes,” says he, “you\r\nteachee me good, you teachee them good.” “No, no, Friday,” says I,\r\n“you shall go without me; leave me here to live by myself, as I did\r\nbefore.” He looked confused again at that word, and running to one of\r\nthe hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, comes and\r\ngives it me. “What must I do with this?” says I to him. “You take kill\r\nFriday,” says he. “What must I kill you for?” said I again. He returns\r\nvery quick, “What you send Friday away for? Take kill Friday, no send\r\nFriday away.” This he spoke so earnestly, that I saw tears stand in his\r\neyes. In a word, I so plainly discovered the utmost affection in him\r\nto me, and a firm resolution in him, that I told him then, and often\r\nafter, that I would never send him away from me if he was willing to\r\nstay with me.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a settled affection\r\nto me, and that nothing should part him from me, so I found all the\r\nfoundation of his desire to go to his own country was laid in his\r\nardent affection to the people, and his hopes of my doing them good;\r\na thing which, as I had no notion of myself, so I had not the least\r\nthought or intention or desire of undertaking it. But still I found a\r\nstrong inclination to my attempting an escape, as above, founded on\r\nthe supposition gathered from the discourse, viz., that there were\r\nseventeen bearded men there; and, therefore, without any more delay I\r\nwent to work with Friday to find out a great tree proper to fell, and\r\nmake a large _periagua_, or canoe, to undertake the voyage. There\r\nwere trees enough in the island to have built a little fleet, not of\r\n_periaguas_ and canoes, but even of good large vessels. But the main\r\nthing I looked at was, to get one so near the water that we might\r\nlaunch it when it was made, to avoid the mistake I committed at first.\r\n\r\nAt last Friday pitched upon a tree, for I found he knew much better\r\nthan I what kind of wood was fittest for it; nor can I tell, to this\r\nday, what wood to call the tree we cut down, except that it was very\r\nlike the tree we call fustic, or between that and the Nicaragua wood,\r\nfor it was much of the same color and smell. Friday was for burning the\r\nhollow or cavity of this tree out, to make it for a boat, but I showed\r\nhim how rather to cut it out with tools; which, after I had showed him\r\nhow to use, he did very handily; and in about a month’s hard labor\r\nwe finished it, and made it very handsome; especially when, with our\r\naxes, which I showed him how to handle, we cut and hewed the outside\r\ninto the true shape of a boat. After this, however, it cost us near a\r\nfortnight’s time to get her along, as it were inch by inch, upon great\r\nrollers into the water; but when she was in, she would have carried\r\ntwenty men with great ease.\r\n\r\nWhen she was in the water, and though she was so big, it amazed me to\r\nsee with what dexterity, and how swift my man Friday would manage her,\r\nturn her, and paddle her along. So I asked him if he would, and if we\r\nmight venture over in her. “Yes,” he said, “he venture over in her very\r\nwell, though great blow wind.” However, I had a farther design that he\r\nknew nothing of, and that was to make a mast and sail, and to fit her\r\nwith an anchor and cable. As to a mast, that was easy enough to get;\r\nso I pitched upon a straight young cedar tree, which I found near the\r\nplace, and which there was great plenty of in the island; and I set\r\nFriday to work to cut it down, and gave him directions how to shape and\r\norder it. But as to the sail, that was my particular care. I knew I had\r\nold sails, or rather pieces of old sails enough; but as I had had them\r\nnow twenty-six years by me, and had not been very careful to preserve\r\nthem, not imagining that I should ever have this kind of use for\r\nthem, I did not doubt but they were all rotten, and, indeed, most of\r\nthem were so. However, I found two pieces which appeared pretty good,\r\nand with these I went to work, and with a great deal of pains, and\r\nawkward tedious stitching (you may be sure) for want of needles, I, at\r\nlength, made a three-cornered ugly thing, like what we call in England\r\na shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go with a boom at bottom, and a little\r\nshort sprit at the top, such as usually our ships’ longboats sail with,\r\nand such as I best knew how to manage; because it was such a one as I\r\nhad to the boat in which I made my escape from Barbary, as related in\r\nthe first part of my story.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “--_we cut and hewed the outside into the true shape of\r\na boat_”]\r\n\r\nI was near two months performing this last work, viz., rigging and\r\nfitting my mast and sails; for I finished them very complete, making\r\na small stay, and a sail, or foresail, to it, to assist, if we should\r\nturn to windward; and, which was more than all, I fixed a rudder to the\r\nstern of her to steer with; and though I was but a bungling shipwright\r\nyet as I knew the usefulness, and even necessity, of such a thing, I\r\napplied myself with so much pains to do it, that at last I brought it\r\nto pass; though, considering the many dull contrivances I had for it\r\nthat failed, I think it cost me almost as much labor as making the\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nAfter all this was done too, I had my man Friday to teach as to what\r\nbelonged to the navigation of my boat; for though he knew very well\r\nhow to paddle a canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a sail and a\r\nrudder; and was the most amazed when he saw me work the boat to and\r\nagain in the sea by the rudder, and how the sail jibed, and filled this\r\nway, or that way, as the course we sailed changed; I say, when he saw\r\nthis, he stood like one astonished and amazed. However, with a little\r\nuse I made all these things familiar to him, and he became an expert\r\nsailor, except that as to the compass I could make him understand very\r\nlittle of that. On the other hand, as there was very little cloudy\r\nweather, and seldom or never any fogs in those parts, there was the\r\nless occasion for a compass, seeing the stars were always to be seen\r\nby night, and the shore by day, except in the rainy seasons, and then\r\nnobody cared to stir abroad, either by land or sea.\r\n\r\nI was now entered on the seven and twentieth year of my captivity in\r\nthis place; though the three last years that I had this creature with\r\nme ought rather to be left out of the account, my habitation being\r\nquite of another kind than in all the rest of the time. I kept the\r\nanniversary of my landing here with the same thankfulness to God for\r\nHis mercies as at first; and if I had such cause of acknowledgement\r\nat first, I had much more so now, having such additional testimonies\r\nof the care of Providence over me, and the great hopes I had of being\r\neffectually and speedily delivered; for I had an invincible impression\r\nupon my thoughts that my deliverance was at hand, and that I should not\r\nbe another year in this place. However, I went on with my husbandry,\r\ndigging, planting, fencing, as usual. I gathered and cured my grapes,\r\nand did every necessary thing as before.\r\n\r\nThe rainy season was, in the meantime, upon me, when I kept more within\r\ndoors than at other times; so I had stowed our new vessel as secure\r\nas we could, bringing her up into the creek, where, as I said in the\r\nbeginning, I landed my rafts from the ship; and hauling her up to the\r\nshore at high-water mark, I made my man Friday dig a little dock, just\r\nbig enough to hold her, and just deep enough to give her water enough\r\nto float in; and then, when the tide was out, we made a strong dam\r\ncross the end of it, to keep the water out; and so she lay dry, as to\r\nthe tide, from the sea; and to keep the rain off, we laid a great many\r\nboughs of trees, so thick, that she was as well thatched as a house;\r\nand thus we waited for the month of November and December, in which I\r\ndesigned to make my adventure.\r\n\r\nWhen the settled season began to come in, as the thought of my\r\ndesign returned with the fair weather, I was preparing daily for the\r\nvoyage; and the first thing I did was to lay by a certain quantity of\r\nprovisions, being the stores for our voyage; and intended, in a week or\r\na fortnight’s time, to open the dock, and launch out our boat. I was\r\nbusy one morning upon something of this kind, when I called to Friday,\r\nand bid him go to the seashore and see if he could find a turtle, or\r\ntortoise, a thing which we generally got once a week, for the sake of\r\nthe eggs as well as the flesh. Friday had not been long gone when he\r\ncame running back, and flew over my outer wall, or fence, like one\r\nthat felt not the ground, or the steps he set his feet on; and before\r\nI had time to speak to him, he cries out to me, “O master! O master! O\r\nsorrow! O bad!” “What’s the matter, Friday?” says I. “O yonder, there,”\r\nsays he, “one, two, three canoe! one, two, three!” By his way of\r\nspeaking, I concluded there were six; but, on inquiry, I found it was\r\nbut three.\r\n\r\n“Well, Friday,” says I, “do not be frightened.” So I heartened him up\r\nas well as I could. However, I saw the poor fellow was most terribly\r\nscared; for nothing ran in his head but that they were come to look\r\nfor him, and would cut him in pieces, and eat him; and the poor fellow\r\ntrembled so, that I scarce knew what to do with him. I comforted him\r\nas well as I could, and told him I was in as much danger as he, and\r\nthat they would eat me as well as him. “But,” says I, “Friday, we\r\nmust resolve to fight them. Can you fight, Friday?” “Me shoot,” says\r\nhe; “but there come many great number.” “No matter for that,” said I\r\nagain; “our guns will frighten them that we do not kill.” So I asked\r\nhim whether, if I resolved to defend him, he would defend me, and stand\r\nby me, and do just as I bid him. He said, “Me die when you bid die,\r\nmaster.”\r\n\r\nSo I went and fetched a good dram of rum, and gave him; for I had\r\nbeen so good a husband of my rum, that I had a great deal left.\r\nWhen he drank it, I made him take the two fowling-pieces, which we\r\nalways carried, and load them with large swanshot, as big as small\r\npistol-bullets. Then I took four muskets, and loaded them with two\r\nslugs and five small bullets each; and my two pistols I loaded with a\r\nbrace of bullets each. I hung my great sword, as usual, naked by my\r\nside, and gave Friday his hatchet.\r\n\r\nWhen I had thus prepared myself, I took my perspective-glass, and went\r\nup to the side of the hill to see what I could discover; and I found\r\nquickly, by my glass, that there were one and twenty savages, three\r\nprisoners, and three canoes, and that their whole business seemed to be\r\nthe triumphant banquet upon these three human bodies; a barbarous feast\r\nindeed, but nothing more than, as I had observed, was usual with them.\r\n\r\nI observed also that they were landed, not where they had done when\r\nFriday made his escape, but nearer to my creek, where the shore was\r\nlow, and where the thick wood came close almost down to the sea. This,\r\nwith the abhorrence of the inhuman errand these wretches came about,\r\nfilled me with such indignation, that I came down again to Friday, and\r\ntold him I was resolved to go down to them, and kill them all, and\r\nasked him if he would stand by me. He was now gotten over his fright,\r\nand his spirits being a little raised with the dram I had given him, he\r\nwas very cheerful, and told me, as before, he would die when I bid die.\r\n\r\nIn this fit of fury, I took first and divided the arms which I had\r\ncharged, as before, between us. I gave Friday one pistol to stick in\r\nhis girdle, and three guns upon his shoulder; and I took one pistol,\r\nand the other three myself, and in this posture we marched out. I took\r\na small bottle of rum in my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with\r\nmore powder and bullet; and as to orders, I charged him to keep close\r\nbehind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or do anything, till I bid him,\r\nand in the meantime not to speak a word. In this posture I fetched a\r\ncompass to my right hand of near a mile as well to get over the creek\r\nas to get into the wood, so that I might come within shot of them\r\nbefore I should be discovered, which I had seen, by my glass, it was\r\neasy to do.\r\n\r\nWhile I was making this march, my former thoughts returning, I began\r\nto abate my resolution. I do not mean that I entertained any fear of\r\ntheir number; for as they were naked, unarmed wretches, ’tis certain I\r\nwas superior to them; nay, though I had been alone. But it occurred to\r\nmy thoughts what call, what occasion, much less what necessity, I was\r\nin to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people who had neither\r\ndone or intended me any wrong; who, as to me, were innocent, and whose\r\nbarbarous customs were their own disaster; being in them a token indeed\r\nof God’s having left them, with the other nations of that part of the\r\nworld, to such stupidity, and to such inhuman courses; but did not\r\ncall me to take upon me to be a judge of their actions, much less an\r\nexecutioner of His justice; that whenever He thought fit, He would\r\ntake the cause into His own hands, and by national vengeance, punish\r\nthem, as a people, for national crimes; but that, in the meantime, it\r\nwas none of my business; that, it was true, Friday might justify it,\r\nbecause he was a declared enemy, and in state of war with those very\r\nparticular people, and it was lawful for him to attack them; but I\r\ncould not say the same with respect to me. These things were so warmly\r\npressed upon my thoughts all the way as I went, that I resolved I\r\nwould only go and place myself near them, that I might observe their\r\nbarbarous feast, and that I would act then as God should direct; but\r\nthat, unless something offered that was more a call to me than yet I\r\nknew of, I would not meddle with them.\r\n\r\nWith this resolution I entered the wood, and with all possible wariness\r\nand silence, Friday following close at my heels, I marched till I came\r\nto the skirt of the wood, on the side which was next to them; only that\r\none corner of the wood lay between me and them. Here I called softly\r\nto Friday, and showing him a great tree, which was just at the corner\r\nof the wood, I bade him go to the tree and bring me word if he could\r\nsee there plainly what they were doing. He did so, and came immediately\r\nback to me, and told me they might be plainly viewed there; that they\r\nwere all about their fire, eating the flesh of one of their prisoners,\r\nand that another lay bound upon the sand, a little from them, which, he\r\nsaid, they would kill next; and, which fired all the very soul within\r\nme, he told me it was not one of their nation, but one of the bearded\r\nmen, whom he had told me of, that came to their country in the boat. I\r\nwas filled with horror at the very naming the white, bearded man; and\r\ngoing to the tree, I saw plainly, by my glass, a white man, who lay\r\nupon the beach of the sea, with his hands and feet tied with flags, or\r\nthings like rushes, and that he was an European, and had clothes on.\r\n\r\nThere was another tree, and a little ticket beyond it, about fifty\r\nyards nearer to them than the place where I was, which, by going a\r\nlittle way about, I saw I might come at undiscovered, and that when I\r\nshould be within half shot of them; so I withheld my passion, though I\r\nwas indeed enraged to the highest degree; and going back about twenty\r\npaces, I got behind some bushes, which held all the way till I came to\r\nthe other tree; and then I came to a little rising ground, which gave\r\nme a full view of them, at the distance of about eighty yards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n_Robinson Releases a Spaniard--Friday Discovers His\r\nFather--Accommodation Provided for These New Guests, Who Were Afterward\r\nSent to Liberate the Other Spaniards--Arrival of an English Vessel_\r\n\r\n\r\nI had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the dreadful wretches\r\nsat upon the ground, all close huddled together, and had just sent the\r\nother two to butcher the poor Christian, and bring him, perhaps limb\r\nby limb, to their fire; and they were stooped down to untie the bands\r\nat his feet. I turned to Friday: “Now, Friday,” said I, “do as I bid\r\nthee.” Friday said he would. “Then, Friday,” says I, “do exactly as you\r\nsee me do; fail in nothing.” So I set down one of the muskets and the\r\nfowling-piece upon the ground, and Friday did the like by his; and with\r\nthe other musket I took my aim at the savages, bidding him do the like.\r\nThen asking him if he was ready, he said, “Yes.” “Then fire at them,”\r\nsaid I; and the same moment I fired also.\r\n\r\nFriday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side that he\r\nshot he killed two of them, and wounded three more; and on my side I\r\nkilled one and wounded two. They were, you may be sure, in a dreadful\r\nconsternation; and all of them who were not hurt jumped up upon their\r\nfeet, but did not immediately know which way to run, or which way to\r\nlook, for they knew not from whence their destruction came. Friday\r\nkept his eyes close upon me, that, as I had bid him, he might observe\r\nwhat I did; so as soon as the first shot was made I threw down the\r\npiece, and took up the fowling-piece; and Friday did the like. He saw\r\nme cock and present; he did the same again. “Are you ready, Friday?”\r\nsaid I. “Yes,” said he. “Let fly, then,” said I, “in the name of God!”\r\nand with that I fired again among the amazed wretches, and so did\r\nFriday; and as our pieces were now loaded with what I called swanshot\r\nor small pistol-bullets, we found only two drop, but so many were\r\nwounded, that they ran about yelling and screaming like mad creatures,\r\nall bloody, and miserably wounded most of them; whereof three more fell\r\nquickly after, though not quite dead.\r\n\r\n“Now, Friday,” says I, laying down the discharged pieces, and taking\r\nup the musket which was yet loaded, “follow me,” says I, which he did\r\nwith a great deal of courage; upon which I rushed out of the wood, and\r\nshowed myself, and Friday close at my foot. As soon as I perceived they\r\nsaw me I shouted as loud as I could, and bade Friday do so too; and\r\nrunning as fast as I could, which, by the way, was not very fast, being\r\nloaden with arms as I was, I made directly towards the poor victim,\r\nwho was, as I said, lying upon the beach, or shore, between the place\r\nwhere they sat and the sea. The two butchers, who were just going to\r\nwork with him, had left him at the surprise of our first fire, and fled\r\nin a terrible fright to the seaside, and had jumped into a canoe, and\r\nthree more of the rest made the same way. I turned to Friday, and bid\r\nhim step forwards and fire at them. He understood me immediately, and\r\nrunning about forty yards, to be near them, he shot at them, and I\r\nthought he had killed them all, for I saw them all fall of a heap into\r\nthe boat; though I saw two of them up again quickly. However, he killed\r\ntwo of them, and wounded the third, so that he lay down in the bottom\r\nof the boat as if he had been dead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “--_and no sooner had he the arms in his hands but, as\r\nif they had put new vigor into him, he flew upon his murderers like a\r\nfury_”]\r\n\r\nWhile my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife and cut the\r\nflags that bound the poor victim; and loosing his hands and feet, I\r\nlifted him up, and asked him in the Portuguese tongue who he was. He\r\nanswered in Latin, “Christianus”; but was so weak and faint, that he\r\ncould scarce stand or speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket and gave\r\nit him, making signs that he should drink, which he did; and I gave\r\nhim a piece of bread, which he ate. Then I asked him what countryman\r\nhe was; and he said, “Espagniole”; and being a little recovered, let\r\nme know, by all the signs he could possibly make, how much he was in\r\nmy debt for his deliverance. “Señor,” said I, with as much Spanish as\r\nI could make up, “we will talk afterwards, but we must fight now. If\r\nyou have any strength left, take this pistol and sword, and lay about\r\nyou.” He took them very thankfully, and no sooner had he the arms in\r\nhis hands but, as if they had put new vigor into him, he flew upon his\r\nmurderers like a fury, and had cut two of them in pieces in an instant;\r\nfor the truth is, as the whole was a surprise to them, so the poor\r\ncreatures were so much frightened with the noise of our pieces, that\r\nthey fell down for mere amazement and fear, and had no more power to\r\nattempt their own escape, than their flesh had to resist our shot; and\r\nthat was the case of those five that Friday shot at in the boat; for\r\nas three of them fell with the hurt they received, so the other two\r\nfell with the fright.\r\n\r\nI kept my piece in my hand still without firing, being willing to\r\nkeep my charge ready, because I had given the Spaniard my pistol and\r\nsword. So I called to Friday, and bade him run up to the tree from\r\nwhence we first fired, and fetch the arms which lay there that had\r\nbeen discharged, which he did with great swiftness; and then giving\r\nhim my musket, I sat down myself to load all the rest again, and bade\r\nthem come to me when they wanted. While I was loading these pieces,\r\nthere happened a fierce engagement between the Spaniard and one of the\r\nsavages, who made at him with one of their great wooden swords, the\r\nsame weapon that was to have killed him before if I had not prevented\r\nit. The Spaniard, who was as bold and as brave as could be imagined,\r\nthough weak, had fought this Indian a good while, and had cut him two\r\ngreat wounds on his head; but the savage being a stout lusty fellow,\r\nclosing in with him, had thrown him down being faint, and was wringing\r\nmy sword out of his hand, when the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely\r\nquitting the sword, drew the pistol from his girdle, shot the savage\r\nthrough the body, and killed him upon the spot, before I, who was\r\nrunning to help him, could come near him.\r\n\r\nFriday being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying wretches with\r\nno weapon in his hand but his hatchet; and with that he despatched\r\nthose three who, as I said before, were wounded at first, and fallen,\r\nand all the rest he could come up with; and the Spaniard coming to me\r\nfor a gun, I gave him one of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued\r\ntwo of the savages, and wounded them both; but as he was not able to\r\nrun, they both got away from him into the wood, where Friday pursued\r\nthem, and killed one of them; but the other was too nimble for him, and\r\nthough he was wounded, yet had plunged himself into the sea, and swam\r\nwith all his might off to those two who were left in the canoe; which\r\nthree in the canoe, with one wounded, who we know not whether he died\r\nor no, were all that escape our hands of one and twenty. The account of\r\nthe rest is as follows:--\r\n\r\n   3  killed at our first shot from the tree.\r\n   2  killed at the next shot.\r\n   2  killed by Friday in the boat.\r\n   2  killed by ditto, of those at first wounded.\r\n   1  killed by ditto in the wood.\r\n   3  killed by the Spaniard.\r\n   4  killed, being found dropped here and there of their\r\n        wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase of them.\r\n   4  escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if not dead.\r\n  --\r\n  21 in all.\r\n\r\nThose that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gun-shot; and\r\nthough Friday made two or three shots at them, I did not find that\r\nhe hit any of them. Friday would fain have had me take one of their\r\ncanoes, and pursue them; and, indeed, I was very anxious about their\r\nescape, lest carrying the news home to their people they should come\r\nback perhaps with two or three hundred of their canoes, and devour us\r\nby mere multitude. So I consented to pursue them by sea, and running\r\nto one of their canoes, I jumped in, and bade Friday follow me. But\r\nwhen I was in the canoe, I was surprised to find another poor creature\r\nlie there alive, bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, for the\r\nslaughter, and almost dead with fear, not knowing what the matter was;\r\nfor he had not been able to look up over the side of the boat, he was\r\ntied so hard, neck and heels, and had been tied so long, that he had\r\nreally but little life in him.\r\n\r\nI immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes, which they had bound him\r\nwith, and would have helped him up; but he could not stand or speak,\r\nbut groaned most piteously, believing, it seems, still that he was only\r\nunbound in order to be killed.\r\n\r\nWhen Friday came to him, I bade him speak to him, and tell him of his\r\ndeliverance; and pulling out my bottle made him give the poor wretch a\r\ndram; which, with the news of his being delivered, revived him, and he\r\nsat up in the boat. But when Friday came to hear him speak, and look in\r\nhis face, it would have moved any one to tears to have seen how Friday\r\nkissed him, embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped\r\nabout, danced, sang; then cried again, wrung his hands, beat his own\r\nface and head, and then sang and jumped about again, like a distracted\r\ncreature. It was a good while before I could make him speak to me, or\r\ntell me what was the matter; but when he came a little to himself, he\r\ntold me that it was his father.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see what ecstasy\r\nand filial affection had worked in this poor savage at the sight of\r\nhis father, and of his being delivered from death; nor, indeed, can I\r\ndescribe half the extravagances of his affection after this; for he\r\nwent into the boat, and out of the boat, a great many times. When he\r\nwent in to him, he would sit down by him, open his breast, and hold his\r\nfather’s head close to his bosom, half an hour together to nourish it;\r\nthen he took his arms and ankles, which were numbed and stiff with the\r\nbinding, and chafed and rubbed them with his hands; and I, perceiving\r\nwhat the case was, gave him some rum out of my bottle to rub them with,\r\nwhich did them a great deal of good.\r\n\r\nThis action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the other\r\nsavages, who were now gotten almost out of sight; and it was happy for\r\nus that we did not, for it blew so hard within two hours after, and\r\nbefore they could be gotten a quarter of the way, and continued blowing\r\nso hard all night, and that from the north-west, which was against\r\nthem, that I should not suppose their boat could live, or that they\r\never reached to their own coast.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Friday. He was so busy about his father, that I could\r\nnot find in my heart to take him off for some time; but after I thought\r\nhe could leave him a little, called him to me, and he came jumping and\r\nlaughing, and pleased to the highest extreme. Then I asked him if he\r\nhad given his father any bread. He shook his head, and said, “None;\r\nugly dog eat all up self.” So I gave him a cake of bread out of a\r\nlittle pouch I carried on purpose. I also gave him a dram for himself,\r\nbut he would not taste it, but carried it to his father. I had in\r\nmy pocket also two or three bunches of my raisins, so I gave him a\r\nhandful of them for his father. He had no sooner given his father these\r\nraisins, but I saw him come out of the boat and run away, as if he had\r\nbeen bewitched, he ran at such a rate; for he was the swiftest fellow\r\nof his foot that ever I saw. I say, he ran at such a rate, that he\r\nwas out of sight, as it were, in an instant; and though I called, and\r\nhallooed too, after him, it was all one, away he went; and in a quarter\r\nof an hour I saw him come back again, though not so fast as he went;\r\nand as he came nearer I found his pace was slacker, because he had\r\nsomething in his hand.\r\n\r\nWhen he came up to me, I found he had been quite home for an earthen\r\njug, or pot, to bring his father some fresh water, and that he had got\r\ntwo more cakes or loaves of bread. The bread he gave me, but the water\r\nhe carried to his father. However, as I was very thirsty too, I took a\r\nlittle sup of it. This water revived his father more than all the rum\r\nor spirits I had given him, for he was just fainting with thirst.\r\n\r\nWhen his father had drank, I called to him to know if there was any\r\nwater left. He said “Yes”; and I bade him give it to the poor Spaniard,\r\nwho was in as much want of it as his father; and I sent one of the\r\ncakes, that Friday brought, to the Spaniard too, who was indeed very\r\nweak, and was reposing himself upon a green place under the shade of a\r\ntree; and whose limbs were also very stiff, and very much swelled with\r\nthe rude bandage he had been tied with. When I saw that upon Friday’s\r\ncoming to him with the water he sat up and drank, and took the bread,\r\nand began to eat, I went to him, and gave him a handful of raisins. He\r\nlooked up in my face with all the tokens of gratitude and thankfulness\r\nthat could appear in any countenance; but was so weak, notwithstanding\r\nhe had so exerted himself in the fight, that he could not stand up upon\r\nhis feet. He tried to do it two or three times, but was really not\r\nable, his ankles were so swelled and so painful to him; so I bade him\r\nsit still, and caused Friday to rub his ankles, and bathe them with\r\nrum, as he had done his father’s.\r\n\r\nI observed the poor affectionate creature, every two minutes, or\r\nperhaps less, all the while he was here, turn his head about to see if\r\nhis father was in the same place and posture as he left him sitting;\r\nand at last he found he was not to be seen; at which he started up,\r\nand without speaking a word, flew with that swiftness to him, that one\r\ncould scarce perceive his feet to touch the ground as he went. But when\r\nhe came, he only found he had laid himself down to ease his limbs; so\r\nFriday came back to me presently, and I then spoke to the Spaniard to\r\nlet Friday help him up, if he could, and lead him to the boat, and then\r\nhe should carry him to our dwelling, where I would take care of him.\r\nBut Friday, a lusty strong fellow, took the Spaniard quite up upon his\r\nback, and carried him away to the boat, and set him down softly upon\r\nthe side or gunwale of the canoe, with his feet in the inside of it,\r\nand then lifted him quite in, and set him close to his father; and\r\npresently stepping out again, launched the boat off, and paddled it\r\nalong the shore faster than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty\r\nhard too. So he brought them both safe into our creek, and leaving them\r\nin the boat, ran away to fetch the other canoe. As he passed me, I\r\nspoke to him, and asked him whither he went. He told me, “Go fetch more\r\nboat.” So away he went like the wind, for sure never man or horse ran\r\nlike him; and he had the other canoe in the creek almost as soon as I\r\ngot to it by land; so he wafted me over, and then went to help our new\r\nguests out of the boat, which he did; but they were neither of them\r\nable to walk, so that poor Friday knew not what to do.\r\n\r\nTo remedy this I went to work in my thought, and calling to Friday to\r\nbid him sit down on the bank while he came to me, I soon made a kind\r\nof hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I carried them up both\r\ntogether upon it between us. But when we got them to the outside of\r\nour wall, or fortification, we were at a worse loss than before, for\r\nit was impossible to get them over, and I was resolved not to break it\r\ndown. So I set to work again; and Friday and I, in about two hours’\r\ntime, made a very handsome tent, covered with old sails, and above that\r\nwith boughs of trees, being in the space without our outward fence,\r\nand between that and the grove of young wood which I had planted; and\r\nhere we made them two beds of such things as I had, viz., of good\r\nrice-straw, with blankets laid upon it to lie on, and another to cover\r\nthem, on each bed.\r\n\r\nMy island was now peopled, and I thought myself very rich in subjects;\r\nand it was a merry reflection, which I frequently made, how like a king\r\nI looked. First of all, the whole country was my own mere property, so\r\nthat I had an undoubted right of dominion. Secondly, my people were\r\nperfectly subjected. I was absolute lord and lawgiver; they all owed\r\ntheir lives to me, and were ready to lay down their lives, if there had\r\nbeen occasion of it, for me. It was remarkable, too, we had but three\r\nsubjects, and they were of three different religions. My man Friday was\r\na Protestant, his father was a Pagan and a cannibal, and the Spaniard\r\nwas a Papist. However, I allowed liberty of conscience throughout my\r\ndominions. But this is by the way.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I had secured my two weak rescued prisoners, and given them\r\nshelter and a place to rest them upon, I began to think of making some\r\nprovision for them; and the first thing I did, I ordered Friday to take\r\na yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a goat, out of my particular flock,\r\nto be killed; when I cut off the hinder-quarter, and chopping it into\r\nsmall pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and stewing, and made\r\nthem a very good dish, I assure you, of flesh and broth, having put\r\nsome barley and rice also into the broth; and as I cooked it without\r\ndoors, for I made no fire within my inner wall, so I carried it all\r\ninto the new tent, and having set a table there for them, I sat down\r\nand ate my own dinner also with them, and as well as I could cheered\r\nthem, and encouraged them; Friday being my interpreter, especially to\r\nhis father, and indeed, to the Spaniard too; for the Spaniard spoke the\r\nlanguage of the savages pretty well.\r\n\r\nAfter we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday to take one of\r\nthe canoes and go and fetch our muskets and other firearms, which, for\r\nwant of time, we had left upon the place of battle; and the next day I\r\nordered him to go and bury the dead bodies of the savages, which lay\r\nopen to the sun, and would presently be offensive; and I also ordered\r\nhim to bury the horrid remains of their barbarous feast, and which I\r\ncould not think of doing myself; nay, I could not bear to see them, if\r\nI went that way. All which he punctually performed, and defaced the\r\nvery appearance of the savages being there; so that when I went again\r\nI could scarce know where it was, otherwise than by the corner of the\r\nwood pointing to the place.\r\n\r\nI then began to enter into a little conversation with my two new\r\nsubjects; and first, I set Friday to inquire of his father what he\r\nthought of the escape of the savages in that canoe, and whether we\r\nmight expect a return of them, with a power too great for us to resist.\r\nHis first opinion was, that the savages in the boat never could live\r\nout the storm which blew that night they went off, but must, of\r\nnecessity, be drowned, or driven south to those other shores, where\r\nthey were as sure to be devoured as they were to be drowned if they\r\nwere cast away. But as to what they would do if they came safe on\r\nshore, he said he knew not; but it was his opinion that they were so\r\ndreadfully frightened with the manner of their being attacked, the\r\nnoise, and the fire, that he believed they would tell their people\r\nthey were all killed by thunder and lightning, not by the hand of\r\nman; and that the two which appeared, viz., Friday and me, were two\r\nheavenly spirits, or furies, come down to destroy them, and not men\r\nwith weapons. This, he said, he knew, because he heard them all cry\r\nout so in their language to one another; for it was impossible to them\r\nto conceive that a man could dart fire, and speak thunder, and kill at\r\na distance without lifting up the hand, as was done now. And this old\r\nsavage was in the right; for as I understood since by other hands,\r\nthe savages never attempted to go to the island afterwards. They were\r\nso terrified with the accounts given by those four men (for, it seems,\r\nthey did escape the sea), that they believed whoever went to that\r\nenchanted island would be destroyed with fire from the gods.\r\n\r\nThis, however, I knew not, and therefore was under continual\r\napprehensions for a good while, and kept always upon my guard, me and\r\nall my army; for as we were now four of us, I would have ventured upon\r\na hundred of them, fairly in the open field, at any time.\r\n\r\nIn a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the fear of their\r\ncoming wore off, and I began to take my former thoughts of a voyage\r\nto the main into consideration; being likewise assured, by Friday’s\r\nfather, that I might depend upon good usage from their nation, on his\r\naccount, if I would go.\r\n\r\nBut my thoughts were a little suspended when I had a serious discourse\r\nwith the Spaniard, and when I understood that there were sixteen more\r\nof his countrymen and Portuguese, who, having been cast away, and\r\nmade their escape to that side, lived there at peace, indeed, with\r\nthe savages, but were very sore put to it for necessaries, and indeed\r\nfor life. I asked him all the particulars of their voyage, and found\r\nthey were a Spanish ship bound from the Rio de la Plata to Havana,\r\nbeing directed to leave their loading there, which was chiefly hides\r\nand silver, and to bring back what European goods they could meet with\r\nthere; that they had five Portuguese seamen on board, whom they took\r\nout of another wreck; that five of their own men were drowned when the\r\nfirst ship was lost, and that these escaped, through infinite dangers\r\nand hazards, and arrived, almost starved, on the cannibal coast, where\r\nthey expected to have been devoured every moment.\r\n\r\nHe told me they had some arms with them, but they were perfectly\r\nuseless, for that they had neither powder nor ball, the washing of the\r\nsea having spoiled all their powder but a little, which they used, at\r\ntheir first landing, to provide themselves some food.\r\n\r\nI asked him what he thought would become of them there, and if they\r\nhad formed no design of making any escape? He said they had many\r\nconsultations about it; but that having neither vessel, or tools to\r\nbuild one, or provisions of any kind, their councils always ended in\r\ntears and despair.\r\n\r\nI asked him how he thought they would receive a proposal from me, which\r\nmight tend towards an escape; and whether, if they were all here, it\r\nmight not be done? I told him with freedom, I feared mostly their\r\ntreachery and ill usage of me if I put my life in their hands; for that\r\ngratitude was no inherent virtue in the nature of man, nor did men\r\nalways square their dealings by the obligations they had received, so\r\nmuch as they did by the advantages they expected. I told him it would\r\nbe very hard that I should be the instrument of their deliverance, and\r\nthat they should afterwards make me their prisoner, in New Spain, where\r\nan Englishman was certain to lose his life, what necessity or what\r\naccident soever brought him thither; and that I had rather be delivered\r\nup to the savages, and be devoured alive. I added, that otherwise I\r\nwas persuaded, if they were all here, we might, with so many hands,\r\nbuild a bark large enough to carry us all away, either to the Brazils,\r\nsouthward, or to the islands, or Spanish coast, northward; but that\r\nif, in requital, they should, when I had put weapons into their hands,\r\ncarry me by force among their own people, I might be ill used for my\r\nkindness to them, and make my case worse than it was before.\r\n\r\nHe answered, with a great deal of candor and ingenuity, that their\r\ncondition was so miserable, and they were so sensible of it, that\r\nhe believed they would abhor the thought of using any man unkindly\r\nthat should contribute to their deliverance; and that, if I pleased,\r\nhe would go to them with the old man, and discourse with them about\r\nit, and return again, and bring me their answer; that he would make\r\nconditions with them upon their solemn oath that they should be\r\nabsolutely under my leading, as their commander and captain; and that\r\nthey should swear upon the holy sacraments and the gospel to be true to\r\nme, and to go to such Christian country as that I should agree to, and\r\nno other, and to be wholly and absolutely by my orders till they were\r\nlanded safely in such country as I intended; and that he would bring a\r\ncontract from them, under their hands, for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThen he told me he would first swear to me himself, that he would never\r\nstir from me as long as he lived till I gave him orders; and that he\r\nwould take my side to the last drop of his blood, if there should\r\nhappen the least breach of faith among his countrymen.\r\n\r\nHe told me they were all of them very civil, honest men, and they were\r\nunder the greatest distress imaginable, having neither weapons nor\r\nclothes, nor any food, but at the mercy and discretion of the savages;\r\nout of all hopes of ever returning to their own country; and that he\r\nwas sure, if I would undertake their relief, they would live and die by\r\nme.\r\n\r\nUpon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve them, if\r\npossible, and to send the old savage and this Spaniard over to them\r\nto treat. But when we had gotten all things in readiness to go, the\r\nSpaniard himself started an objection, which had so much prudence in\r\nit on one hand, and so much sincerity on the other hand, that I could\r\nnot but be very well satisfied in it, and by his advice put off the\r\ndeliverance of his comrades for at least half a year. The case was thus:\r\n\r\nHe had been with us now about a month, during which time I had let him\r\nsee in what manner I had provided, with the assistance of Providence,\r\nfor my support; and he saw evidently what stock of corn and rice I had\r\nlaid up; which, as it was more than sufficient for myself, so it was\r\nnot sufficient, at least without good husbandry, for my family, now it\r\nwas increased to number four; but much less would it be sufficient if\r\nhis countrymen, who were, as he said, fourteen, still alive, should\r\ncome over; and least of all would it be sufficient to victual our\r\nvessel, if we should build one, for a voyage to any of the Christian\r\ncolonies of America. So he told me he thought it would be more\r\nadvisable to let him and the two others dig and cultivate some more\r\nland, as much as I could spare seed to sow; and that we should wait\r\nanother harvest, that we might have a supply of corn for his countrymen\r\nwhen they should come; for want might be a temptation to them to\r\ndisagree, or not to think themselves delivered, otherwise than out\r\nof one difficulty into another. “You know,” says he, “the children of\r\nIsrael, though they rejoiced at first for their being delivered out of\r\nEgypt, yet rebelled even against God Himself, that delivered them, when\r\nthey came to want bread in the wilderness.”\r\n\r\nHis caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that I could not\r\nbut be very well pleased with his proposal, as well as I was satisfied\r\nwith his fidelity. So we fell to digging all four of us, as well as the\r\nwooden tools we were furnished with permitted; and in about a month’s\r\ntime, by the end of which it was seed-time, we had gotten as much land\r\ncured and trimmed up as we sowed twenty-two bushels of barley on, and\r\nsixteen jars of rice; which was, in short, all the seed we had to\r\nspare; nor, indeed, did we leave ourselves barley sufficient for our\r\nown food for the six months that we had to expect our crop; that is to\r\nsay, reckoning from the time we set our seed aside for sowing; for it\r\nis not to be supposed it is six months in the ground in that country.\r\n\r\nHaving now society enough, and our number being sufficient to put us\r\nout of fear of the savages, if they had come, unless their number\r\nhad been very great, we went freely all over the island, whenever we\r\nfound occasion; and as here we had our escape or deliverance upon our\r\nthoughts, it was impossible, at least for me, to have the means of it\r\nout of mine. To this purpose I marked out several trees which I thought\r\nfit for our work, and I set Friday and his father to cutting them down;\r\nand then I caused the Spaniard, to whom I imparted my thought on that\r\naffair, to oversee and direct their work. I showed them with what\r\nindefatigable pains I had hewed a large tree into single planks, and\r\nI caused them to do the like, till they had made about a dozen large\r\nplanks of good oak, near two feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and\r\nfrom two inches to four inches thick. What prodigious labor it took up,\r\nany one may imagine.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I contrived to increase my little flock of tame goats\r\nas much as I could; and to this purpose I made Friday and the Spaniard\r\ngo out one day, and myself with Friday the next day, for we took our\r\nturns, and by this means we got about twenty young kids to breed up\r\nwith the rest, for whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and\r\nadded them to our flock. But above all, the season for curing the\r\ngrapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious quantity to be hung up\r\nin the sun, that I believe, had we been at Alicant, where the raisins\r\nof the sun are cured, we could have filled sixty or eighty barrels;\r\nand these, with our bread, was a great part of our food, and very good\r\nliving too, I assure you; for it is an exceeding nourishing food.\r\n\r\nIt was now harvest, and our crop in good order. It was not the most\r\nplentiful increase I had seen in the island, but, however, it was\r\nenough to answer our end; for from our twenty-two bushels we brought in\r\nand thrashed out above two hundred and twenty bushels, and the like in\r\nproportion of the rice; which was store enough for our food to the next\r\nharvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore with me;\r\nor if we had been ready for a voyage it would very plentifully have\r\nvictualled our ship to have carried us to any part of the world, that\r\nis to say, of America.\r\n\r\nWhen we had thus housed and secured our magazine of corn, we fell to\r\nwork to make more wicker-work, viz., great baskets, in which we kept\r\nit; and the Spaniard was very handy and dexterous at this part, and\r\noften blamed me that I did not make some things for defense of this\r\nkind of work; but I saw no need of it.\r\n\r\nAnd now having a full supply of food for all the guests I expected, I\r\ngave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to see what he could do\r\nwith those he had left behind him there. I gave him a strict charge in\r\nwriting not to bring any man with him who would not first swear, in the\r\npresence of himself and of the old savage, that he would no way injure,\r\nfight with, or attack the person he should find in the island, who was\r\nso kind to send for them in order to their deliverance; but that they\r\nwould stand by and defend him against all such attempts, and wherever\r\nthey went would be entirely under and subjected to his commands; and\r\nthat this should be put in writing, and signed with their hands. How we\r\nwere to have this done, when I knew they had neither pen nor ink, that\r\nindeed was a question which we never asked.\r\n\r\nUnder these instructions, the Spaniard and the old savage, the father\r\nof Friday, went away in one of the canoes which they might be said to\r\ncome in, or rather were brought in, when they came as prisoners to be\r\ndevoured by the savages.\r\n\r\nI gave each of them a musket, with a firelock on it, and about eight\r\ncharges of powder and ball, charging them to be very good husbands of\r\nboth, and not to use either of them but upon urgent occasion.\r\n\r\nThis was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by me, in view\r\nof my deliverance, for now twenty-seven years and some days. I gave\r\nthem provisions of bread and of dried grapes sufficient for themselves\r\nfor many days, and sufficient for all their countrymen for about eight\r\ndays’ time; and wishing them a good voyage, I saw them go, agreeing\r\nwith them about a signal they should hang out at their return, by which\r\nI should know them again, when they came back, at a distance, before\r\nthey came on shore.\r\n\r\nThey went away with a fair gale on the day that the moon was at full,\r\nby my account in the month of October; but as for an exact reckoning of\r\ndays, after I had once lost it, I could never recover it again; nor had\r\nI kept even the number of years so punctually as to be sure that I was\r\nright, though as it proved, when I afterwards examined my account, I\r\nfound I had kept a true reckoning of years.\r\n\r\nIt was no less than eight days I had waited for them, when a strange\r\nand unforeseen accident intervened, of which the like has not perhaps\r\nbeen heard of in history. I was fast asleep in my hutch one morning,\r\nwhen my man Friday came running in to me, and called aloud, “Master,\r\nmaster, they are come, they are come!”\r\n\r\nI jumped up, and, regardless of danger, I went out as soon as I could\r\nget my clothes on, through my little grove, which, by the way, was by\r\nthis time grown to be a very thick wood; I say, regardless of danger,\r\nI went without my arms, which was not my custom to do; but I was\r\nsurprised when, turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw a boat at\r\nabout a league and a half’s distance standing in for the shore, with a\r\nshoulder-of-mutton sail, as they call it, and the wind blowing pretty\r\nfair to bring them in; also I observed presently that they did not come\r\nfrom that side which the shore lay on, but from the southernmost end of\r\nthe island. Upon this I called Friday in, and bid him lie close, for\r\nthese were not the people we looked for, and that we might not know yet\r\nwhether they were friends or enemies.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, I went in to fetch my perspective-glass, to see\r\nwhat I could make of them; and having taken the ladder out, I climbed\r\nup to the top of the hill, as I used to do when I was apprehensive of\r\nanything, and to take my view the plainer, without being discovered.\r\n\r\nI had scarce set my foot on the hill, when my eye plainly discovered a\r\nship lying at an anchor at about two leagues and a half’s distance from\r\nme, south-south-east, but not above a league and a half from the shore.\r\nBy my observation, it appeared plainly to be an English ship, and the\r\nboat appeared to be an English longboat.\r\n\r\nI cannot express the confusion I was in; though the joy of seeing\r\na ship, and one who I had reason to believe was manned by my own\r\ncountrymen, and consequently friends, was such as I cannot describe.\r\nBut yet I had some secret doubts hung about me I cannot tell from\r\nwhence they came, bidding me keep upon my guard. In the first place, it\r\noccurred to me to consider what business an English ship could have in\r\nthat part of the world, since it was not the way to or from any part\r\nof the world where the English had any traffic; and I knew there had\r\nbeen no storms to drive them in there as in distress; and that if they\r\nwere English really, it was most probable that they were here upon no\r\ngood design; and that I had better continue as I was, than fall into\r\nthe hands of thieves and murderers.\r\n\r\nLet no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger which\r\nsometimes are given him when he may think there is no possibility of\r\nits being real. That such hints and notices are given us, I believe\r\nfew that have made any observation of things can deny; that they are\r\ncertain discoveries of an invisible world, and a converse of spirits,\r\nwe cannot doubt; and if the tendency of them seems to be to warn us of\r\ndanger, why should we not suppose they are from some friendly agent,\r\nwhether supreme, or inferior and subordinate, is not the question, and\r\nthat they are given for our good?\r\n\r\nThe present question abundantly confirms me in the justice of this\r\nreasoning; for had I not been made cautious by this secret admonition,\r\ncome it from whence it will, I had been undone inevitably, and in a far\r\nworse condition than before, as you will see presently.\r\n\r\nI had not kept myself long in this posture, but I saw the boat draw\r\nnear the shore, as if they looked for a creek to thrust in at, for the\r\nconvenience of landing. However, as they did not come quite far enough,\r\nthey did not see the little inlet where I formerly landed my rafts;\r\nbut ran their boat on shore upon the beach, at about half a mile from\r\nme, which was very happy for me; for otherwise they would have landed\r\njust, as I may say, at my door, and would soon have beaten me out of my\r\ncastle, and perhaps have plundered me of all I had.\r\n\r\nWhen they were on shore, I was fully satisfied that they were\r\nEnglishmen, at least most of them; one or two I thought were Dutch,\r\nbut it did not prove so. There were in all eleven men, whereof three\r\nof them I found were unarmed, and, as I thought, bound; and when the\r\nfirst four or five of them were jumped on shore, they took those three\r\nout of the boat, as prisoners. One of the three I could perceive using\r\nthe most passionate gestures of entreaty, affliction, and despair, even\r\nto a kind of extravagance; the other two, I could perceive, lifted up\r\ntheir hands sometimes, and appeared concerned indeed, but not to such a\r\ndegree as the first.\r\n\r\nI was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew not what the meaning\r\nof it should be. Friday called out to me in English as well as he\r\ncould, “O master! you see English mans eat prisoner as well as savage\r\nmans.” “Why,” says I, “Friday, do you think they are agoing to eat them\r\nthen?” “Yes,” says Friday, “they will eat them.” “No, no,” says I,\r\n“Friday, I am afraid they will murder them, indeed, but you may be sure\r\nthey will not eat them.”\r\n\r\nAll this while I had no thought of what the matter really was, but\r\nstood trembling with the horror of the sight, expecting every moment\r\nwhen the three prisoners should be killed; nay, once I saw one of the\r\nvillains lift up his arm with a great cutlass, as the seamen call it,\r\nor sword, to strike one of the poor men; and I expected to see him\r\nfall every moment, at which all the blood in my body seemed to run\r\nchill in my veins.\r\n\r\nI wished heartily now for my Spaniard, and the savage that was gone\r\nwith him; or that I had any way to have come undiscovered within shot\r\nof them, that I might have rescued the three men, for I saw no firearms\r\nthey had among them; but it fell out to my mind another way.\r\n\r\nAfter I had observed the outrageous usage of the three men by the\r\ninsolent seamen, I observed the fellows run scattering about the land,\r\nas if they wanted to see the country. I observed that the three other\r\nmen had liberty to go also where they pleased; but they sat down all\r\nthree upon the ground, very pensive, and looked like men in despair.\r\n\r\nThis put me in mind of the first time when I came on shore, and began\r\nto look about me; how I gave myself over for lost; how wildly I looked\r\nround me; what dreadful apprehensions I had; and how I lodged in the\r\ntree all night, for fear of being devoured by wild beasts.\r\n\r\nAs I knew nothing that night of the supply I was to receive by the\r\nprovidential driving of the ship nearer the land by the storms and\r\ntide, by which I have since been so long nourished and supported; so\r\nthese three poor desolate men knew nothing how certain of deliverance\r\nand supply they were, how near it was to them, and how effectually and\r\nreally they were in a condition of safety, at the same time that they\r\nthought themselves lost, and their case desperate.\r\n\r\nSo little do we see before us in the world, and so much reason have\r\nwe to depend cheerfully upon the great Maker of the world, that He\r\ndoes not leave His creatures so absolutely destitute, but that, in the\r\nworst circumstances, they have always something to be thankful for,\r\nand sometimes are nearer their deliverance than they imagine; nay, are\r\neven brought to their deliverance by the means by which they seem to be\r\nbrought to their destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n_Robinson Discovers Himself to the English Captain--Assists Him In\r\nReducing His Mutinous Crew, Who Submit to Him_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was just at the top of high-water when these people came on shore;\r\nand while partly they stood parleying with the prisoners they brought,\r\nand partly while they rambled about to see what kind of a place they\r\nwere in, they had carelessly stayed till the tide was spent, and the\r\nwater was ebbed considerably away, leaving their boat aground.\r\n\r\nThey had left two men in the boat, who, as I found afterwards, having\r\ndrank a little too much brandy, fell asleep. However, one of them\r\nwaking sooner than the other, and finding the boat too fast aground\r\nfor him to stir it, hallooed for the rest, who were straggling about,\r\nupon which they all soon came to the boat; but it was past all their\r\nstrength to launch her, the boat being very heavy, and the shore on\r\nthat side being a soft oozy sand, almost like a quicksand.\r\n\r\nIn this condition, like true seamen, who are perhaps the least of all\r\nmankind given to forethought, they gave it over, and away they strolled\r\nabout the country again; and I heard one of them say aloud to another,\r\ncalling them off from the boat, “Why, let her alone, Jack, can’t ye?\r\nshe will float next tide;” by which I was fully confirmed in the main\r\ninquiry of what countrymen they were.\r\n\r\nAll this while I kept myself very close, not once daring to stir out\r\nof my castle, any farther than to my place of observation near the top\r\nof the hill; and very glad I was to think how well it was fortified. I\r\nknew it was no less than ten hours before the boat could be on float\r\nagain, and by that time it would be dark, and I might be at more\r\nliberty to see their motions, and to hear their discourse, if they had\r\nany.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I fitted myself up for a battle, as before, though\r\nwith more caution, knowing I had to do with another kind of enemy than\r\nI had at first. I ordered Friday also, whom I had made an excellent\r\nmarksman with his gun, to load himself with arms. I took myself two\r\nfowling-pieces, and I gave him three muskets. My figure, indeed, was\r\nvery fierce. I had my formidable goat-skin coat on, with the great cap\r\nI have mentioned, a naked sword by my side, two pistols in my belt, and\r\na gun upon each shoulder.\r\n\r\nIt was my design, as I said above, not to have made any attempt till\r\nit was dark; but about two o’clock, being the heat of the day, I found\r\nthat, in short, they were all gone straggling into the wood, and, as I\r\nthought, were laid down to sleep. The three poor distressed men, too\r\nanxious for their condition to get any sleep, were, however, set down\r\nunder the shelter of a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from\r\nme, and, as I thought, out of sight of any of the rest.\r\n\r\nUpon this I resolved to discover myself to them, and learn something of\r\ntheir condition. Immediately I marched in the figure as above, my man\r\nFriday at a good distance behind me, as formidable for his arms as I,\r\nbut not making quite so staring a spectre-like figure as I did.\r\n\r\nI came as near them undiscovered as I could, and then, before any\r\nof them saw me, I called aloud to them in Spanish, “What are ye,\r\ngentlemen?”\r\n\r\nThey started up at the noise, but were ten times more confounded when\r\nthey saw me, and the uncouth figure that I made. They made no answer\r\nat all, but I thought I perceived them just going to fly from me, when\r\nI spoke to them in English. “Gentlemen,” said I, “do not be surprised\r\nat me; perhaps you may have a friend near you, when you did not expect\r\nit.” “He must be sent directly from heaven then,” said one of them very\r\ngravely to me, and pulling off his hat at the same time to me, “for our\r\ncondition is past the help of man.” “All help is from heaven, sir,”\r\nsaid I. “But can you put a stranger in the way how to help you, for you\r\nseem to me to be in some great distress? I saw you when you landed; and\r\nwhen you seemed to make applications to the brutes that came with you,\r\nI saw one of them lift up his sword to kill you.”\r\n\r\nThe poor man, with tears running down his face, and trembling, looking\r\nlike one astonished, returned, “Am I talking to God, or man? Is it\r\na real man, or an angel?” “Be in no fear about that, sir,” said I.\r\n“If God had sent an angel to relieve you, he would have come better\r\nclothed, and armed after another manner than you see me in. Pray lay\r\naside your fears; I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to assist\r\nyou, you see. I have one servant only; we have arms and ammunition;\r\ntell us freely, can we serve you? What is your case?”\r\n\r\n“Our case,” said he, “sir, is too long to tell you while our murderers\r\nare so near; but in short, sir, I was commander of that ship; my men\r\nhave mutinied against me, they have been hardly prevailed on not to\r\nmurder me; and at last have set me on shore in this desolate place,\r\nwith these two men with me, one my mate, the other a passenger, where\r\nwe expected to perish, believing the place to be uninhabited, and know\r\nnot yet what to think of it.”\r\n\r\n“Where are those brutes, your enemies?” said I. “Do you know where\r\nthey are gone?” “There they lie, sir,” said he, pointing to a thicket\r\nof trees. “My heart trembles for fear they have seen us, and heard you\r\nspeak. If they have, they will certainly murder us all.”\r\n\r\n“Have they any firearms?” said I. He answered, “They have only two\r\npieces, and one which they left in the boat.” “Well then,” said I,\r\n“leave the rest to me, I see they are all asleep; it is an easy thing\r\nto kill them all; but shall we rather take them prisoners?” He told me\r\nthere were two desperate villains among them that it was scarce safe to\r\nshow any mercy to; but if they were secured, he believed all the rest\r\nwould return to their duty. I asked him which they were? He told me he\r\ncould not at that distance describe them, but he would obey my orders\r\nin anything I would direct. “Well,” says I, “let us retreat out of\r\ntheir view or hearing, lest they awake, and we will resolve farther.”\r\nSo they willingly went back with me, till the woods covered us from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“Look you, sir,” said I, “if I venture upon your deliverance, are you\r\nwilling to make two conditions with me?” He anticipated my proposals,\r\nby telling me that both he and the ship, if recovered, should be\r\nwholly directed and commanded by me in everything; and if the ship was\r\nnot recovered, he would live and die with me in what part of the world\r\nsoever I would send him; and the two other men said the same.\r\n\r\n“Well,” says I, “my conditions are but two. 1. That while you stay on\r\nthis island with me, you will not pretend to any authority here; and if\r\nI put arms into your hands, you will, upon all occasions, give them up\r\nto me, and do no prejudice to me or mine upon this island; and in the\r\nmeantime, be governed by my orders. 2. That if the ship is, or may be,\r\nrecovered, you will carry me and my man to England, passage free.”\r\n\r\nHe gave me all the assurances that the invention and faith of man\r\ncould devise that he would comply with these most reasonable demands;\r\nand, besides, would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it upon all\r\noccasions, as long as he lived.\r\n\r\n“Well then,” said I, “here are three muskets for you, with powder and\r\nball; tell me next what you think is proper to be done.” He showed\r\nall the testimony of his gratitude that he was able, but offered to\r\nbe wholly guided by me. I told him I thought it was hard venturing\r\nanything; but the best method I could think of was to fire upon them at\r\nonce, as they lay; and if any was not killed at the first volley, and\r\noffered to submit, we might save them, and so put it wholly upon God’s\r\nprovidence to direct the shot.\r\n\r\nHe said very modestly that he was loth to kill them, if he could help\r\nit; but that those two were incorrigible villains, and had been the\r\nauthors of all the mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped, we should\r\nbe undone still; for they would go on board and bring the whole\r\nship’s company, and destroy us all. “Well then,” says I, “necessity\r\nlegitimates my advice, for it is the only way to save our lives.”\r\nHowever, seeing him still cautious of shedding blood, I told him they\r\nshould go themselves, and manage as they found convenient.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake, and soon\r\nafter we saw two of them on their feet. I asked him if either of them\r\nwere of the men who he had said were the heads of the mutiny? He said,\r\n“No.” “Well then,” said I, “you may let them escape; and Providence\r\nseems to have wakened them on purpose to save themselves. Now,” says I,\r\n“if the rest escape you, it is your fault.”\r\n\r\nAnimated by this, he took the musket I had given him in his hand, and\r\na pistol in his belt, and his two comrades with him, with each man\r\na piece in his hand. The two men who were with him going first made\r\nsome noise, at which one of the seamen who was awake turned about,\r\nand seeing them coming cried out to the rest; but it was too late\r\nthen, for the moment he cried out they fired; I mean the two men, the\r\ncaptain wisely reserving his own piece. They had so well aimed their\r\nshot at the men they knew, that one of them was killed on the spot, and\r\nthe other very much wounded; but not being dead, he started up upon\r\nhis feet, and called eagerly for help to the other. But the captain\r\nstepping to him, told him ’twas too late to cry for help, he should\r\ncall upon God to forgive his villainy; and with that word knocked him\r\ndown with the stock of his musket, so that he never spoke more. There\r\nwere three more in the company, and one of them was also slightly\r\nwounded. By this time I was come; and when they saw their danger, and\r\nthat it was in vain to resist, they begged for mercy. The captain told\r\nthem he would spare their lives if they would give him any assurance of\r\ntheir abhorrence of the treachery they had been guilty of, and would\r\nswear to be faithful to him in recovering the ship, and afterwards in\r\ncarrying her back to Jamaica, from whence they came. They gave him all\r\nthe protestations of their sincerity that could be desired, and he\r\nwas willing to believe them, and spare their lives, which I was not\r\nagainst, only I obliged him to keep them bound hand and foot while they\r\nwere upon the island.\r\n\r\nWhile this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain’s mate to the\r\nboat, with orders to secure her, and bring away the oars and sail,\r\nwhich they did; and by and by three straggling men, that were (happily\r\nfor them) parted from the rest, came back upon hearing the guns fired;\r\nand seeing their captain, who before was their prisoner, now their\r\nconqueror, they submitted to be bound also, and so our victory was\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nIt now remained that the captain and I should inquire into one\r\nanother’s circumstances. I began first, and told him my whole history,\r\nwhich he heard with an attention even to amazement; and particularly\r\nat the wonderful manner of my being furnished with provisions and\r\nammunition; and, indeed, as my story is a whole collection of wonders,\r\nit affected him deeply. But when he reflected from thence upon himself,\r\nand how I seemed to have been preserved there on purpose to save his\r\nlife, the tears ran down his face, and he could not speak a word more.\r\n\r\nAfter this communication was at an end, I carried him and his two men\r\ninto my apartment, leading them in just where I came out, viz., at the\r\ntop of the house, where I refreshed them with such provisions as I had,\r\nand showed them all the contrivances I had made during my long, long\r\ninhabiting that place.\r\n\r\nAll I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing; but\r\nabove all, the captain admired my fortification, and how perfectly I\r\nhad concealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which, having been\r\nnow planted near twenty years, and the trees growing much faster\r\nthan in England, was become a little wood, and so thick, that it was\r\nimpassable in any part of it but at that one side where I had reserved\r\nmy little winding passage into it. I told him this was my castle and\r\nmy residence, but that I had a seat in the country, as most princes\r\nhave, whither I could retreat upon occasion, and I would show him\r\nthat too another time; but at present, our business was to consider\r\nhow to recover the ship. He agreed with me as to that but told me he\r\nwas perfectly at a loss what measures to take, for that there were\r\nstill six and twenty hands on board, who having entered into a cursed\r\nconspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their lives to the law,\r\nwould be hardened in it now by desperation, and would carry it on,\r\nknowing that if they were reduced, they should be brought to the\r\ngallows as soon as they came to England, or to any of the English\r\ncolonies; and that therefore there would be no attacking them with so\r\nsmall a number as we were.\r\n\r\nI mused for some time upon what he said, and found it was a very\r\nrational conclusion, and that therefore something was to be resolved\r\non very speedily, as well to draw the men on board into some snare for\r\ntheir surprise, as to prevent their landing upon us, and destroying us.\r\nUpon this it presently occurred to me that in a little while the ship’s\r\ncrew, wondering what was become of their comrades, and of the boat,\r\nwould certainly come on shore in their other boat to see for them; and\r\nthat then, perhaps, they might come armed, and be too strong for us.\r\nThis he allowed was rational.\r\n\r\nUpon this, I told him the first thing we had to do was to stave the\r\nboat, which lay upon the beach, so that they might not carry her off;\r\nand taking everything out of her, leave her so far useless as not to\r\nbe fit to swim. Accordingly we went on board, took the arms which were\r\nleft on board out of her, and what else we found there, which was a\r\nbottle of brandy, and another of rum, a few biscuit-cakes, a horn of\r\npowder, and a great lump of sugar in a piece of canvas--the sugar was\r\nfive or six pounds; all of which was very welcome to me, especially the\r\nbrandy and sugar, of which I had had none left for many years.\r\n\r\nWhen we had carried all these things on shore (the oars, mast, sail,\r\nand rudder of the boat were carried away before, as above), we knocked\r\na great hole in her bottom that if they had come strong enough to\r\nmaster us, yet they could not carry off the boat.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it was not much in my thoughts that we could be able to recover\r\nthe ship; but my view was, that if they went away without the boat, I\r\ndid not much question to make her fit again to carry us away to the\r\nLeeward Islands, and call upon our friends the Spaniards in my way;\r\nfor I had them still in my thoughts.\r\n\r\nWhile we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by main\r\nstrength, heaved the boat up upon the beach so high that the tide would\r\nnot fleet her off at high-water mark; and besides, had broke a hole in\r\nher bottom too big to be quickly stopped, and were sat down musing what\r\nwe should do, we heard the ship fire a gun, and saw her make a waft\r\nwith her flag as a signal for the boat to come on board. But no boat\r\nstirred; and they fired several times, making other signals for the\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nAt last when all their signals and firings proved fruitless, and they\r\nfound the boat did not stir, we saw them, by the help of my glasses,\r\nhoist another boat out, and row towards the shore; and we found, as\r\nthey approached, that there was no less than ten men in her, and that\r\nthey had firearms with them.\r\n\r\nAs the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore we had a full view of\r\nthem as they came, and a plain sight of the men, even of their faces;\r\nbecause the tide having set them a little to the east of the other\r\nboat, they rowed up under shore, to come to the same place where the\r\nother had landed, and where the boat lay.\r\n\r\nBy this means, I say, we had a full view of them, and the captain knew\r\nthe persons and characters of all the men in the boat, of whom he said\r\nthat there were three very honest fellows, who, he was sure, were led\r\ninto this conspiracy by the rest, being overpowered and frightened; but\r\nthat as for the boatswain, who, it seems, was the chief officer among\r\nthem, and all the rest, they were as outrageous as any of the ship’s\r\ncrew, and were no doubt made desperate in their new enterprise; and\r\nterribly apprehensive he was that they would be too powerful for us.\r\n\r\nI smiled at him, and told him that men in our circumstances were past\r\nthe operation of fear; that seeing almost every condition that could\r\nbe was better than that which we were supposed to be in, we ought to\r\nexpect that the consequence, whether death or life, would be sure to\r\nbe a deliverance. I asked him what he thought of the circumstances of\r\nmy life, and whether a deliverance were not worth venturing for? “And\r\nwhere, sir,” said I, “is your belief of my being preserved here on\r\npurpose to save your life which elevated you a little while ago? For\r\nmy part,” said I, “there seems to be but one thing amiss in all the\r\nprospect of it.” “What’s that?” said he. “Why,” said I, “’tis that,\r\nas you say, there are three or four honest fellows among them, which\r\nshould be spared; had they been all of the wicked part of the crew I\r\nshould have thought God’s providence had singled them out to deliver\r\nthem into your hands; for depend upon it, every man of that that comes\r\nashore are our own, and shall die or live as they behave to us.”\r\n\r\nAs I spoke this with a raised voice and cheerful countenance, I found\r\nit greatly encouraged him; so we set vigorously to our business. We\r\nhad, upon the first appearance of the boat’s coming from the ship,\r\nconsidered of separating our prisoners, and had, indeed, secured them\r\neffectually.\r\n\r\nTwo of them, of whom the captain was less assured than ordinary, I sent\r\nwith Friday and one of the three delivered men to my cave, where they\r\nwere remote enough, and out of danger of being heard or discovered,\r\nor of finding their way out of the woods if they could have delivered\r\nthemselves. Here they left them bound, but gave them provisions, and\r\npromised them, if they continued there quietly, to give them their\r\nliberty in a day or two; but that if they attempted their escape, they\r\nshould be put to death without mercy. They promised faithfully to bear\r\ntheir confinement with patience, and were very thankful that they had\r\nsuch good usage as to have provisions and a light left them; for Friday\r\ngave them candles (such as we made ourselves) for their comfort; and\r\nthey did not know but that he stood sentinel over them at the entrance.\r\n\r\nThe other prisoners had better usage. Two of them were kept pinioned,\r\nindeed, because the captain was not free to trust them; but the other\r\ntwo were taken into my service, upon their captain’s recommendation,\r\nand upon their solemnly engaging to live and die with us; so with them\r\nand the three honest men we were seven men well armed; and I made no\r\ndoubt we should be able to deal well enough with the ten that were\r\na-coming, considering that the captain had said there were three or\r\nfour honest men among them also.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they got to the place where their other boat lay, they ran\r\ntheir boat into the beach, and came all on shore, hauling the boat up\r\nafter them, which I was glad to see; for I was afraid they would rather\r\nhave left the boat at an anchor some distance from the shore, with some\r\nhands in her to guard her, and so we should not be able to seize the\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nBeing on shore, the first thing they did was to run to their other\r\nboat; and it was easy to see that they were under a great surprise to\r\nfind her stripped, as above, of all that was in her, and a great hole\r\nin her bottom.\r\n\r\nAfter they had mused a while upon this, they set up two or three great\r\nshouts, hallooing with all their might, to try if they could make their\r\ncompanions hear; but all was to no purpose. Then they came all close\r\nin a ring, and fired a volley of their small arms, which, indeed, we\r\nheard, and the echoes made the woods ring. But it was all one; those in\r\nthe cave we were sure could not hear, and those in our keeping, though\r\nthey heard it well enough, yet durst give no answer to them.\r\n\r\nThey were so astonished at the surprise of this, that, as they told us\r\nafterwards, they resolved to go all on board again, to their ship, and\r\nlet them know there that the men were all murdered, and the longboat\r\nstaved. Accordingly, they immediately launched their boat again, and\r\ngot all of them on board.\r\n\r\nThe captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded at this, believing\r\nthey would go on board the ship again, and set sail, giving their\r\ncomrades for lost, and so he should still lose the ship, which he\r\nwas in hopes we should have recovered; but he was quickly as much\r\nfrightened the other way.\r\n\r\nThey had not been long put off with the boat but we perceived them all\r\ncoming on shore again; but with this new measure in their conduct,\r\nwhich it seems they consulted together upon, viz., to leave three men\r\nin the boat, and the rest to go on shore, and go up into the country to\r\nlook for their fellows.\r\n\r\nThis was a great disappointment to us, for now we were at a loss what\r\nto do; for our seizing those seven men on shore would be no advantage\r\nto us if we let the boat escape, because they would then row away to\r\nthe ship, and then the rest of them would be sure to weigh and set\r\nsail, and so our recovering the ship would be lost. However, we had no\r\nremedy but to wait and see what the issue of things might present. The\r\nseven men came on shore, and the three who remained in the boat put her\r\noff to a good distance from the shore, and came to an anchor to wait\r\nfor them; so that it was impossible for us to come at them in the boat.\r\n\r\nThose that came on shore kept close together, marching towards the top\r\nof the little hill under which my habitation lay; and we could see them\r\nplainly, though they could not perceive us. We could have been very\r\nglad they would have come nearer to us, so that we might have fired at\r\nthem, or that they would have gone farther off, that we might have come\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nBut when they were come to the brow of the hill, where they could see a\r\ngreat way into the valleys and woods which lay towards the north-east\r\npart, and where the island lay lowest, they shouted and hallooed till\r\nthey were weary; and not caring, it seems, to venture far from the\r\nshore, nor far from one another, they sat down together under a tree,\r\nto consider of it. Had they thought fit to have gone to sleep there,\r\nas the other party of them had done, they had done the job for us;\r\nbut they were too full of apprehensions of danger to venture to go to\r\nsleep, though they could not tell what the danger was they had to fear\r\nneither.\r\n\r\nThe captain made a very just proposal to me upon this consultation\r\nof theirs, viz., that perhaps they would all fire a volley again, to\r\nendeavor to make their fellows hear, and that we should all sally upon\r\nthem, just at the juncture when their pieces were all discharged, and\r\nthey would certainly yield, and we should have them without bloodshed.\r\nI liked the proposal, provided it was done while we were near enough to\r\ncome up to them before they could load their pieces again.\r\n\r\nBut this event did not happen, and we lay still a long time, very\r\nirresolute what course to take. At length I told them there would be\r\nnothing to be done, in my opinion, till night; and then, if they did\r\nnot return to the boat, perhaps we might find a way to get between them\r\nand the shore, and so might use some stratagem with them in the boat to\r\nget them on shore.\r\n\r\nWe waited a great while, though very impatient for their removing; and\r\nwere very uneasy when, after long consultations, we saw them start all\r\nup, and march down toward the sea. It seems they had such dreadful\r\napprehensions upon them of the danger of the place, that they resolved\r\nto go on board the ship again, give their companions over for lost, and\r\nso go on with their intended voyage with the ship.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I imagined it to be,\r\nas it really was, that they had given over their search, and were for\r\ngoing back again; and the captain, as soon as I told him my thoughts,\r\nwas ready to sink at the apprehensions of it; but I presently thought\r\nof a stratagem to fetch them back again, and which answered my end to a\r\ntittle.\r\n\r\nI ordered Friday and the captain’s mate to go over the little creek\r\nwestward, towards the place where the savages came on shore when Friday\r\nwas rescued, and as soon as they came to a little rising ground, at\r\nabout half a mile distance, I bade them halloo as loud as they could,\r\nand wait till they found the seamen heard them; that as soon as ever\r\nthey heard the seamen answer them, they should return it again; and\r\nthen keeping out of sight, take a round, always answering when the\r\nothers hallooed, to draw them as far into the island, and among the\r\nwoods, as possible, and then wheel about again to me by such ways as I\r\ndirected them.\r\n\r\nThey were just going into the boat when Friday and the mate hallooed;\r\nand they presently heard them, and answering, ran along the shore\r\nwestward, towards the voice they heard, when they were presently\r\nstopped by the creek, where the water being up, they could not get\r\nover, and called for the boat to come up and set them over, as, indeed,\r\nI expected.\r\n\r\nWhen they had set themselves over, I observed that the boat being gone\r\nup a good way into the creek, and, as it were, in a harbor within the\r\nland, they took one of the three men out of her to go along with them,\r\nand left only two in the boat, having fastened her to the stump of a\r\nlittle tree on the shore.\r\n\r\nThat was what I wished for; and immediately, leaving Friday and the\r\ncaptain’s mate to their business, I took the rest with me, and crossing\r\nthe creek out of their sight, we surprised the two men before they were\r\naware; one of them lying on shore, and the other being in the boat. The\r\nfellow on shore was between sleeping and waking, and going to start up.\r\nThe captain, who was foremost, ran in upon him, and knocked him down,\r\nand then called out to him in the boat to yield, or he was a dead man.\r\n\r\nThere needed very few arguments to persuade a single man to yield when\r\nhe saw five men upon him, and his comrade knocked down; besides, this\r\nwas, it seems, one of the three who were not so hearty in the mutiny\r\nas the rest of the crew and therefore was easily persuaded not only to\r\nyield but afterwards to join very sincerely with us.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Friday and the captain’s mate so well managed their\r\nbusiness with the rest that they drew them, by hallooing and answering,\r\nfrom one hill to another, and from one wood to another, till they not\r\nonly heartily tired them, but left them where they were very sure they\r\ncould not reach back to the boat before it was dark; and, indeed, they\r\nwere heartily tired themselves also by the time they came back to us.\r\n\r\nWe had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the dark, and to fall\r\nupon them, so as to make sure work with them.\r\n\r\nIt was several hours after Friday came back to me before they came back\r\nto their boat; and we could hear the foremost of them, long before they\r\ncame quite up, calling to those behind to come along, and could also\r\nhear them answer and complain how lame and tired they were, and not\r\nable to come any faster; which was very welcome news to us.\r\n\r\nAt length they came up to the boat; but ’tis impossible to express\r\ntheir confusion when they found the boat fast aground in the creek, the\r\ntide ebbed out, and their two men gone. We could hear them call to\r\none another in a most lamentable manner, telling one another they were\r\ngotten onto an enchanted island; that either there were inhabitants\r\non it, and they should all be murdered, or else there were devils and\r\nspirits on it, and they should be all carried away and devoured.\r\n\r\nThey hallooed again, and called their two comrades by their names a\r\ngreat many times; but no answer. After some time we could see them, by\r\nthe little light there was, run about, wringing their hands like men in\r\ndespair, and that sometimes they would go and sit down in the boat to\r\nrest themselves; then come ashore again, and walk about again, and so\r\nthe same thing over again.\r\n\r\nMy men would fain have me give them leave to fall upon them at once\r\nin the dark; but I was willing to take them at some advantage, so to\r\nspare them, and kill as few of them as I could; and especially I was\r\nunwilling to hazard the killing any of our own men, knowing the others\r\nwere very well armed. I resolved to wait, to see if they did not\r\nseparate; and, therefore, to make sure of them, I drew my ambuscade\r\nnearer, and ordered Friday and the captain to creep upon their hands\r\nand feet, as close to the ground as they could, that they might not be\r\ndiscovered, and get as near them as they could possibly, before they\r\noffered to fire.\r\n\r\nThey had not been long in that posture but that the boatswain, who was\r\nthe principal ringleader of the mutiny, and had now shown himself the\r\nmost dejected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking towards\r\nthem, with two more of their crew. The captain was so eager, as having\r\nthis principal rogue so much in his power, that he could hardly have\r\npatience to let him come so near as to be sure of him, for they only\r\nheard his tongue before; but when they came nearer, the captain and\r\nFriday, starting up on their feet, let fly at them.\r\n\r\nThe boatswain was killed upon the spot; the next man was shot into the\r\nbody, and fell just by him, though he did not die till an hour or two\r\nafter; and the third ran for it.\r\n\r\nAt the noise of the fire I immediately advanced with my whole army,\r\nwhich was now eight men, viz., myself, generalissimo; Friday, my\r\nlieutenant-general; the captain and his two men, and the three\r\nprisoners of war, whom we had trusted with arms.\r\n\r\nWe came upon them, indeed, in the dark, so that they could not see our\r\nnumber; and I made the man we had left in the boat, who was now one of\r\nus, call to them by name, to try if I could bring them to a parley,\r\nand so might perhaps reduce them to terms, which fell out just as we\r\ndesired; for indeed it was easy to think, as their condition then was,\r\nthey would be very willing to capitulate. So he calls out as loud as\r\nhe could to one of them, “Tom Smith! Tom Smith!” Tom Smith answered\r\nimmediately, “Who’s that? Robinson?” For it seems he knew his voice.\r\nThe other answered, “Ay, ay; for God’s sake, Tom Smith, throw down your\r\narms and yield, or you are all dead men this moment.”\r\n\r\n“Who must we yield to? Where are they?” says Smith again. “Here they\r\nare,” says he; “here’s our captain, and fifty men with him, have been\r\nhunting you this two hours; the boatswain is killed, Will Frye is\r\nwounded, and I am a prisoner; and if you do not yield, you are all\r\nlost.”\r\n\r\n“Will they give us quarter then,” says Tom Smith, “and we will yield?”\r\n“I’ll go and ask, if you promise to yield,” says Robinson. So he asked\r\nthe captain, and the captain then calls himself out, “You, Smith, you\r\nknow my voice, if you lay down your arms immediately, and submit, you\r\nshall have your lives, all but Will Atkins.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n_Atkins Entreats the Captain to Spare His Life--The Latter Recovers His\r\nVessel from the Mutineers, and Robinson Leaves the Island_\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon this Will Atkins cried out, “For God’s sake, captain, give me\r\nquarter; what have I done? They have been all as bad as I”; which, by\r\nthe way, was not true neither; for, it seems, this Will Atkins was the\r\nfirst man that laid hold of the captain when they first mutinied, and\r\nused him barbarously, in tying his hands, and giving him injurious\r\nlanguage. However, the captain told him he must lay down his arms at\r\ndiscretion, and trust to the governor’s mercy; by which he meant me,\r\nfor they all called me governor.\r\n\r\nIn a word they all laid down their arms, and begged their lives; and I\r\nsent the man that had parleyed with them and two more, who bound them\r\nall; and then my great army of fifty men, which, particularly with\r\nthose three, were all but eight, came up and seized upon them all, and\r\nupon their boat; only that I kept myself and one more out of sight for\r\nreasons of state.\r\n\r\nOur next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing the ship;\r\nand as for the captain, now he had leisure to parley with them, he\r\nexpostulated with them upon the villainy of their practices with him,\r\nand at length upon the farther wickedness of their design, and how\r\ncertainly it must bring them to misery and distress in the end, and\r\nperhaps to the gallows.\r\n\r\nThey all appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their lives.\r\nAs for that, he told them they were none of his prisoners, but the\r\ncommander of the island; that they thought they had set him on shore\r\nin a barren uninhabited island; but it had pleased God so to direct\r\nthem that the island was inhabited, and that the governor was an\r\nEnglishman; that he might hang them all there, if he pleased; but as he\r\nhad given them all quarter, he supposed he would send them to England,\r\nto be dealt with there as justice required, except Atkins, whom he was\r\ncommanded by the governor to advise to prepare for death, for that he\r\nwould be hanged in the morning.\r\n\r\nThough this was all a fiction of his own, yet it had its desired\r\neffect. Atkins fell upon his knees, to beg the captain to intercede\r\nwith the governor for his life; and all the rest begged of him, for\r\nGod’s sake, that they might not be sent to England.\r\n\r\nIt now occurred to me that the time of our deliverance was come, and\r\nthat it would be a most easy thing to bring these fellows in to be\r\nhearty in getting possession of the ship; so I retired in the dark from\r\nthem, that they might not see what kind of a governor they had, and\r\ncalled the captain to me. When I called, as at a good distance, one of\r\nthe men was ordered to speak again, and say to the captain, “Captain,\r\nthe commander calls for you.” And presently the captain replied, “Tell\r\nhis excellency I am just a-coming.” This more perfectly amazed them,\r\nand they all believed that the commander was just by with his fifty men.\r\n\r\nUpon the captain’s coming to me, I told him my project for seizing\r\nthe ship, which he liked wonderfully well, and resolved to put it in\r\nexecution the next morning. But in order to execute it with more art,\r\nand secure of success, I told him we must divide the prisoners, and\r\nthat he should go and take Atkins and two more of the worst of them,\r\nand send them pinioned to the cave where the others lay. This was\r\ncommitted to Friday and the two men who came on shore with the captain.\r\n\r\nThey conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison. And it was, indeed,\r\na dismal place, especially to men in their condition. The others I\r\nordered to my bower, as I called it, of which I have given a full\r\ndescription; and as it was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place was\r\nsecure enough, considering they were upon their behavior.\r\n\r\nTo these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to enter into\r\na parley with them; in a word, to try them, and tell me whether he\r\nthought they might be trusted or no to go on board and surprise the\r\nship. He talked to them of the injury done him, of the condition they\r\nwere brought to; and that though the governor had given them quarter\r\nfor their lives as to the present action, yet that if they were sent\r\nto England they would all be hanged in chains, to be sure; but that if\r\nthey would join in so just an attempt as to recover the ship, he would\r\nhave the governor’s engagement for their pardon.\r\n\r\nAny one may guess how readily such a proposal would be accepted by men\r\nin their condition. They fell down on their knees to the captain, and\r\npromised, with the deepest imprecations, that they would be faithful to\r\nhim to the last drop, and that they should owe their lives to him and\r\nwould go with him all over the world; that they would own him for a\r\nfather to them as long as they lived.\r\n\r\n“Well,” says the captain, “I must go and tell the governor what you\r\nsay, and see what I can do to bring him to consent to it.” So he\r\nbrought me an account of the temper he found them in, and that he\r\nverily believed they would be faithful.\r\n\r\nHowever, that we might be very secure, I told him he should go back\r\nagain and choose out five of them, and tell them they might see that\r\nhe did not want men, that he would take out those five to be his\r\nassistants, and that the governor would keep the other two and the\r\nthree that were sent prisoners to the castle, my cave, as hostages for\r\nthe fidelity of those five; and that if they proved unfaithful in the\r\nexecution, the five hostages should be hanged in chains alive upon the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nThis looked severe, and convinced them that the governor was in\r\nearnest. However, they had no way left then but to accept it; and it\r\nwas now the business of the prisoners as much as of the captain, to\r\npersuade the other five to do their duty.\r\n\r\nOur strength was now thus ordered for the expedition. 1. The captain,\r\nhis mate, and passenger. 2. Then the two prisoners of the first gang,\r\nto whom, having their characters from the captain, I had given their\r\nliberty, and trusted them with arms. 3. The other two whom I had kept\r\ntill now in my bower, pinioned, but upon the captain’s motion had now\r\nreleased. 4. These five released at last; so that they were twelve in\r\nall, besides five we kept prisoners in the cave for hostages.\r\n\r\nI asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these hands on\r\nboard the ship; for as for me and my man Friday, I did not think it\r\nwas proper for us to stir, having seven men left behind, and it was\r\nemployment enough for us to keep them asunder and supply them with\r\nvictuals. As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them fast; but\r\nFriday went in twice a day to them, to supply them with necessaries,\r\nand I made the other two carry provisions to a certain distance, where\r\nFriday was to take it.\r\n\r\nWhen I showed myself to the two hostages it was with the captain, who\r\ntold them I was the person the governor had ordered to look after them,\r\nand that it was the governor’s pleasure they should not stir anywhere\r\nbut by my direction; that if they did, they should be fetched into the\r\ncastle, and be laid in irons; so that as we never suffered them to see\r\nme as governor, so I now appeared as another person, and spoke of the\r\ngovernor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon all occasions.\r\n\r\nThe captain now had no difficulty before him but to furnish his two\r\nboats, stop the breach of one, and man them. He made his passenger\r\ncaptain of one, with four other men; and himself, and his mate, and\r\nfive more went in the other; and they contrived their business very\r\nwell, for they came up to the ship about midnight. As soon as they came\r\nwithin call of the ship, he made Robinson hail them, and tell them\r\nthey had brought off the men and the boat, but that it was a long time\r\nbefore they had found them, and the like, holding them in a chat till\r\nthey came to the ship’s side; when the captain and the mate entering\r\nfirst, with their arms, immediately knocked down the second mate and\r\ncarpenter with the butt-end of their muskets, being very faithfully\r\nseconded by their men. They secured all the rest that were upon the\r\nmain and quarter-decks, and began to fasten the hatches to keep them\r\ndown who were below; when the other boat and their men entering at\r\nthe forechains, secured the forecastle of the ship, and the scuttle\r\nwhich went down into the cookroom, making three men they found there\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nWhen this was done, and all safe upon the deck, the captain ordered the\r\nmate, with three men, to break into the roundhouse, where the new rebel\r\ncaptain lay, and having taken the alarm was gotten up, and with two men\r\nand a boy had gotten firearms in their hands; and when the mate with\r\na crow split open the door, the new captain and his men fired boldly\r\namong them, and wounded the mate with a musket-ball, which broke his\r\narm, and wounded two more of the men, but killed nobody.\r\n\r\nThe mate calling for help, rushed however into the roundhouse, wounded\r\nas he was, and with his pistol shot the new captain through the head,\r\nthe bullet entering at his mouth and came out again behind one of his\r\nears, so that he never spoke a word; upon which the rest yielded, and\r\nthe ship was taken effectually, without any more lives lost.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered seven guns to\r\nbe fired, which was the signal agreed upon with me to give me notice\r\nof his success, which you may be sure I was very glad to hear, having\r\nsat watching upon the shore for it till near two of the clock in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nHaving thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down; and it having\r\nbeen a day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till I was\r\nsomething surprised with the noise of a gun; and presently starting\r\nup, I heard a man call me by the name of “Governor, Governor,” and\r\npresently I knew the captain’s voice; when climbing up to the top of\r\nthe hill, there he stood, and pointing to the ship, he embraced me in\r\nhis arms. “My dear friend and deliverer,” says he, “there’s your ship,\r\nfor she is all yours, and so are we, and all that belong to her.” I\r\ncast my eyes to the ship, and there she rode within little more than\r\nhalf mile of the shore; for they had weighed her anchor as soon as they\r\nwere masters of her, and the weather being fair, had brought her to an\r\nanchor just against the mouth of the little creek, and the tide being\r\nup, the captain had brought the pinnace in near the place where I at\r\nfirst landed my rafts, and so landed just at my door.\r\n\r\nI was at first ready to sink down with the surprise; for I saw my\r\ndeliverance, indeed, visibly put into my hands, all things easy, and\r\na large ship just ready to carry me away whither I pleased to go. At\r\nfirst, for some time I was not able to answer him one word; but as he\r\nhad taken me in his arms, I held fast by him, or I should have fallen\r\nto the ground.\r\n\r\nHe perceived the surprise, and immediately pulled a bottle out of his\r\npocket, and gave me a dram of cordial, which he had brought on purpose\r\nfor me. After I drank it, I sat down upon the ground; and though it\r\nbrought me to myself, yet it was a good while before I could speak a\r\nword to him.\r\n\r\nAll this while the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as I, only not\r\nunder any surprise, as I was; and he said a thousand kind tender\r\nthings to me, to compose me and bring me to myself. But such was the\r\nflood of joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits into confusion.\r\nAt last it broke out into tears, and in a little while after I\r\nrecovered my speech.\r\n\r\nThen I took my turn, and embraced him as my deliverer, and we rejoiced\r\ntogether. I told him I looked upon him as a man sent from heaven to\r\ndeliver me, and that the whole transaction seemed to be a chain of\r\nwonders; that such things as these were the testimonies we had of a\r\nsecret hand of Providence governing the world, and an evidence that the\r\neyes of an infinite Power could search into the remotest corner of the\r\nworld, and send help to the miserable whenever He pleased.\r\n\r\nI forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to heaven; and what\r\nheart could forbear to bless Him, who had not only in a miraculous\r\nmanner provided for one in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate\r\ncondition, but from whom every deliverance must always be acknowledged\r\nto proceed?\r\n\r\nWhen we had talked a while, the captain told me he had brought me some\r\nlittle refreshment, such as the ship afforded, and such as the wretches\r\nthat had been so long his masters had not plundered him of. Upon this\r\nhe called aloud to the boat, and bid his men bring the things ashore\r\nthat were for the governor; and, indeed, it was a present as if I had\r\nbeen one, not that was to be carried away along with them, but as if I\r\nhad been to dwell upon the island still, and they were to go without me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_At first, for some time, I was not able to answer him\r\none word; but as he had taken me in his arms, I held fast by him, or I\r\nshould have fallen to the ground_”]\r\n\r\nFirst, he had brought me a case of bottles full of excellent cordial\r\nwaters, six large bottles of Madeira wine (the bottles held two\r\nquarts apiece), two pounds of excellent good tobacco, twelve good\r\npieces of the ship’s beef, and six pieces of pork, with a bag of peas,\r\nand about a hundredweight of biscuit.\r\n\r\nHe brought me also a box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full of\r\nlemons, and two bottles of lime-juice, and abundance of other things;\r\nbut besides these, and what was a thousand times more useful to me, he\r\nbrought me six clean new shirts, six very good neckcloths, two pair of\r\ngloves, one pair of shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings, and a very\r\ngood suit of clothes of his own, which had been worn but very little;\r\nin a word, he clothed me from head to foot.\r\n\r\nIt was a very kind and agreeable present, as any one may imagine, to\r\none in my circumstances; but never was anything in the world of that\r\nkind so unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy, as it was to me to wear such\r\nclothes at their first putting on.\r\n\r\nAfter these ceremonies passed, and after all his good things were\r\nbrought into my little apartment, we began to consult what was to be\r\ndone with the prisoners we had; for it was worth considering whether\r\nwe might venture to take them with us or no, especially two of them,\r\nwhom we knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree;\r\nand the captain said he knew they were such rogues, that there was no\r\nobliging them; and if he did carry them away, it must be in irons,\r\nas malefactors, to be delivered over to justice at the first English\r\ncolony he could come at; and I found that the captain himself was very\r\nanxious about it.\r\n\r\nUpon this I told him that, if he desired it, I durst undertake to bring\r\nthe two men he spoke of to make it their own request that he should\r\nleave them upon the island. “I should be very glad of that,” says the\r\ncaptain, “with all my heart.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” says I, “I will send for them up, and talk with them for you.”\r\nSo I caused Friday and the two hostages, for they were now discharged,\r\ntheir comrades having performed their promise; I say I caused them to\r\ngo to the cave and bring up the five men, pinioned as they were, to the\r\nbower, and keep them there till I came.\r\n\r\nAfter some time I came thither, dressed in my new habit; and now I was\r\ncalled governor again. Being all met, and the captain with me, I caused\r\nthe men to be brought before me, and I told them I had had a full\r\naccount of their villainous behavior to the captain, and how they had\r\nrun away with the ship, and were preparing to commit farther robberies,\r\nbut that Providence had ensnared them in their own ways, and that they\r\nwere fallen into the pit which they had digged for others.\r\n\r\nI let them know that by my direction the ship had been seized, that\r\nshe lay now in the road, and they might see, by and by, that their new\r\ncaptain had received the reward of his villainy, for that they might\r\nsee him hanging at the yard-arm; that as to them, I wanted to know what\r\nthey had to say why I should not execute them as pirates, taken in the\r\nfact, as by my commission they could not doubt I had authority to do.\r\n\r\nOne of them answered in the name of the rest that they had nothing\r\nto say but this, that when they were taken the captain promised them\r\ntheir lives, and they humbly implored my mercy. But I told them I knew\r\nnot what mercy to show them; for as for myself, I had resolved to quit\r\nthe island with all my men, and had taken passage with the captain\r\nto go for England. And as for the captain, he could not carry them to\r\nEngland other than as prisoners in irons, to be tried for mutiny, and\r\nrunning away with the ship; the consequence of which, they must needs\r\nknow, would be the gallows; so that I could not tell which was best for\r\nthem, unless they had a mind to take their fate in the island. If they\r\ndesired that, I did not care, as I had liberty to leave it. I had some\r\ninclination to give them their lives, if they thought they could shift\r\non shore.\r\n\r\nThey seemed very thankful for it and said they would much rather\r\nventure to stay there than to be carried to England to be hanged; so I\r\nleft it on that issue.\r\n\r\nHowever, the captain seemed to make some difficulty of it, as if he\r\ndurst not leave them there. Upon this I seemed a little angry with the\r\ncaptain, and told him that they were my prisoners, not his; and that\r\nseeing I had offered them so much favor, I would be as good as my word;\r\nand that if he did not think fit to consent to it, I would set them at\r\nliberty, as I found them; and if he did not like it, he might take them\r\nagain if he could catch them.\r\n\r\nUpon this they appeared very thankful, and I accordingly set them at\r\nliberty, and bade them retire into the woods to the place whence they\r\ncame, and I would leave them some firearms, some ammunition, and some\r\ndirections how they should live very well, if they thought fit.\r\n\r\nUpon this I prepared to go on board the ship, but told the captain that\r\nI would stay that night to prepare my things, and desired him to go on\r\nboard in the meantime, and keep all right in the ship, and send the\r\nboat on shore the next day for me; ordering him, in the meantime, to\r\ncause the new captain, who was killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm,\r\nthat these men might see him.\r\n\r\nWhen the captain was gone, I sent for the men up to me to my apartment,\r\nand entered seriously into discourse with them of their circumstances.\r\nI told them I thought they had made a right choice; that if the captain\r\ncarried them away, they would certainly be hanged. I showed them the\r\nnew captain hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them they had\r\nnothing less to expect.\r\n\r\nWhen they had all declared their willingness to stay, I then told\r\nthem I would let them into the story of my living there, and put them\r\ninto the way of making it easy to them. Accordingly I gave them the\r\nwhole history of the place, and of my coming to it, showed them my\r\nfortifications, the way I made my bread, planted my corn, cured my\r\ngrapes; and in a word, all that was necessary to make them easy. I told\r\nthem the story also of the sixteen Spaniards that were to be expected,\r\nfor whom I left a letter, and made them promise to treat them in common\r\nwith themselves.\r\n\r\nI left them my firearms, viz., five muskets, three fowling-pieces, and\r\nthree swords. I had above a barrel and half of powder left; for after\r\nthe first year or two I used but little, and wasted none. I gave them a\r\ndescription of the way I managed the goats, and directions to milk and\r\nfatten them, and to make both butter and cheese.\r\n\r\nIn a word, I gave them every part of my own story, and I told them I\r\nwould prevail with the captain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder\r\nmore, and some garden seeds, which I told them I would have been very\r\nglad of. Also I gave them the bag of peas which the captain had brought\r\nme to eat, and bade them be sure to sow and increase them.\r\n\r\nHaving done all this, I left them the next day, and went on board the\r\nship. We prepared immediately to sail, but did not weigh that night.\r\nThe next morning early two of the five men came swimming to the ship’s\r\nside, and making a most lamentable complaint of the other three, begged\r\nto be taken into the ship for God’s sake, for they should be murdered,\r\nand begged the captain to take them on board, though he hanged them\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nUpon this, the captain pretended to have no power without me; but\r\nafter some difficulty, and after their solemn promises of amendment,\r\nthey were taken on board, and were some time after soundly whipped and\r\npickled, after which they proved very honest and quiet fellows.\r\n\r\nSome time after this the boat was ordered on shore, the tide being\r\nup, with the things promised to the men, to which the captain, at my\r\nintercession, caused their chests and clothes to be added, which they\r\ntook, and were very thankful for. I also encouraged them by telling\r\nthem that if it lay in my way to send any vessel to take them in, I\r\nwould not forget them.\r\n\r\nWhen I took leave of this island, I carried on board, for relics, the\r\ngreat goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella, and my parrot; also I\r\nforgot not to take the money I formerly mentioned, which had lain by me\r\nso long useless that it was grown rusty or tarnished, and could hardly\r\npass for silver till it had been a little rubbed and handled; as also\r\nthe money I found in the wreck of the Spanish ship.\r\n\r\nAnd thus I left the island, the 19th of December, as I found by the\r\nship’s account, in the year 1686, after I had been upon it eight and\r\ntwenty years, two months, and nineteen days, being delivered from this\r\nsecond captivity the same day of the month that I first made my escape\r\nin the _barco-longo_, from among the Moors of Sallee.\r\n\r\nIn this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in England, the 11th of\r\nJune, in the year 1687, having been thirty and five years absent.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (back cover)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nPunctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made consistent when a\r\npredominant preference was found in the original book; otherwise they\r\nwere not changed.\r\n\r\nSimple typographical errors were corrected; unbalanced quotation\r\nmarks were remedied when the change was obvious, and otherwise left\r\nunbalanced.\r\n\r\nIllustrations in this eBook have been positioned between paragraphs\r\nand outside quotations.
