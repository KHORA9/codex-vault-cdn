On\r\nthis depends the absolute Quantity of Money in a Nation; the Relative\r\nQuantity of the several Species, that composeth this Money, being\r\nascertained by the Value imposed on those Species; either as it agrees\r\nwith, or differs from the Value set thereon by other Nations.\r\n\r\nA Nation certainly loses by a Trade, whose Exports are not compleatly\r\nmanufactured, and whole Imports are fully wrought.\r\n\r\nA few Manufactures will serve to exchange for great Quantities of the\r\nsimple Produce of the Earth. The Value of Manufactures, being principally\r\nowing to Labour and Art.\r\n\r\nIf upon these Principles, we examine the State of the Trade of _Ireland_;\r\nI fear we shall find it, in a very declining, and ruinous Condition.\r\n\r\nOur Exportations are made up of Wool, Woorsted, Linnen, Yarn, Beef,\r\nButter, Cheese, Tallow, Hydes, Skins, and a few other Articles.\r\n\r\nWe are not allowed to export our Wool and Woorsted, but to a few Ports\r\nin _England_, and are prohibited from sending thither, or any where\r\nelse, any other of our Woollen Manufacture. Linnen, and some tanned\r\nHides are the only Commodities we export, compleatly Manufactured; Yarn\r\nand Woorsted may be accounted but as half-wrought; Almost all the other\r\nArticles are but little removed from the State, Nature has given them to\r\nus, and have little or no Labour or Art employed about them.\r\n\r\nAt the same Time, we export so liberally the Growth of our Country,\r\nand so little of our Manufactures, we may observe all our Importations\r\nare of such Commodities, as are not capable of farther Improvement;\r\nsuch as _East-Indian_ and _West-Indian_ Goods, Druggs, Wines, Spirits,\r\nManufactures of Wool, Silk, Linnen, Iron, Brass, Glass, _&c._ Nay, the\r\ncommon Produce of almost all Countries, as Corn, Timber, and Fireing,\r\nare imported in great Quantities to supply our Necessities.\r\n\r\nBy this Management of our Trade, we maintain many Thousands in foreign\r\nCountries, and drive Numbers of our own People from us, or leave them to\r\nstarve at home, for Want of Imployment.\r\n\r\nIf to this View, we add that mighty Drain of our Bullion, made by those\r\nGentlemen, who, having great Estates in this Kingdom, choose to spend\r\nthem any where, rather than at home: We can not be at a Loss, how to\r\naccount for the Ballance of Trade, running against us, for so many Years\r\npast.\r\n\r\nThe most certain Way left to retrieve our Affairs, is to lessen our\r\nImports, and to encrease our Exports, especially of Manufactures.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners of the Linnen Manufacture, by an unwearied Application\r\nand uncommon Skill, have contributed greatly to the Value of our Exports,\r\nby the Advancement of the Linnen Manufactury. And I don’t doubt but that\r\nin several other Articles, divers Expedients and Means, may be thought\r\nof, for promoting a greater Consumption of our Own, and lessening that or\r\nforeign Commodities; and as one Instance, I shall beg Leave to propose\r\nan Improvement in our Tannage, by which I apprehend, we shall be enabled\r\nto Tan with the Produce of our own Country all the Hydes that now are\r\nExported Raw; and thereby increase the Value of our Exports, employ many\r\nThousands of our People, and avoid the Necessity of Importing Bark.\r\n\r\nTo set this Matter in a clear Light, I shall lay down, in the first\r\nPlace, the Export of Green Hydes, and the Import of Bark, in the seven\r\nfollowing Years, for the Whole Kingdom, as the same has been extracted\r\nout of the Custom-House Books.\r\n\r\n    _Years._  _Gr. Hydes._  _Bark B’s._\r\n\r\n     1721        46,847      46,556\r\n     1722        86,004      45,794½\r\n     1723       123,514      47,824½\r\n     1724       103,477      60,740½\r\n     1725        69,858      48,407\r\n     1726        60,441      45,279\r\n     1727        57,373      50,598\r\n\r\nIn the next Place it is to be observ’d,\r\n\r\nThat Bark, according to its Goodness, is sold from 6 to 10, and in some\r\nYears, 11 Shillings, the Barrel.\r\n\r\nThat Cow-Hydes weigh from 56, to 84 Pounds each; Bullock Hydes, weigh\r\nfrom 84 to 140 Pounds each, and both are sold from 15 to 21 Shillings,\r\nthe hundred Weight.\r\n\r\nThat Soles, are generally sold from 8 to 8 Pence half-penny the Pound.\r\n\r\nThat Hydes generally lose about half their Weight, in Tanning.\r\n\r\nFrom these Principles, when thrown into mean Proportionate Quantities, it\r\nis evident:\r\n\r\nThat the Quantity of Bark, annually imported, is 50,000 Barrels, and the\r\nValue 21,000 Pounds.\r\n\r\nThat the Number of Green Hydes, annually exported, are 80,000, and their\r\nValue 57,000 Pounds.\r\n\r\nThat if these Green Hydes were tanned before Exportation, their Value\r\nwould be 123,000 Pounds.\r\n\r\nThat the Difference, arising from the Different State of these Hydes,\r\non Exportation, is 66,000 Pounds, which Sum added to the 21,000 Pounds,\r\nthe Value of the imported Bark, making in the whole 87,000 Pounds, must\r\nbe accounted, as so much gained to the Kingdom, should our Tannage be\r\neffected by our own Produce and Labour.\r\n\r\nThe Nations, that demand this Export of those Green Hydes, are those,\r\nwhose black Cattle are not bred, in such Numbers, as to supply their\r\nindispensable Demands; Nor will their dry Hydes, which they receive\r\nfrom their Settlements abroad, admit a thorough Tannage; They, in hopes\r\nof putting their Neighbours, who have a Redundancy of Hydes, under a\r\nNecessity, of parting with them unmanufactured, have prohibited, by the\r\nseverest Penalties, the sending us any Bark. While we, on the other Part,\r\nhave not only complied with this detrimental Export; but also have been\r\nso regardless of our own Interest, as to permit several Tanners, some\r\nfrom this City, to go, and instruct them in an Art, they almost were\r\nStrangers to.\r\n\r\nThe _English_, from a true Sense of the Disadvantage of such a Trade,\r\nhave subjected the Exporter of a Green Hyde, to the Penalties of 500\r\nPounds, and a Disability to trade in Leather, ever after. _Ann._ 14.\r\n_Car._ II.\r\n\r\nSuch an Act, even in our present Circumstances, may, by some, be thought\r\nadviseable for us; Because, such Nations, as now gladly receive our\r\nGreen Hydes, finding a Stop, put to their usual Supplies, would be under\r\na Necessity of receiving our tanned Hydes, and selling us their Bark.\r\nLeather being a Commodity, that does not depend on the Fancy; but,\r\nis absolutely requisite, not only to the Luxuries, but also, to the\r\nNecessities of Mankind.\r\n\r\nAt present, Our Tanners find a great Scarcity of Bark, except those\r\nresiding in some considerable Sea-Port-Town, and are under just\r\nApprehensions of a greater. Several in the Country have been obliged to\r\nlay aside their Pits, and take to other Imployments; the usual Supplies\r\nfailing. Our Neighbours who will permit any Bark, to be sent us, are in\r\na Manner exhausted. Our _American_ Plantations are too remote to find\r\ntheir Account, in sending any great Quantity. The Produce of our Country\r\nis scarce a twentieth Part of what is used in Tanning. This renders our\r\nTannage dear, and often imperfect, so as not to serve a foreign Market,\r\nto Advantage, and Reputation.\r\n\r\nBut if we had Materials, of our own Growth, easy of Acquisition, and\r\nPropagation, that would tan, in every Respect, as well as Bark; were\r\nthese Materials, as to their Powers, well ascertain’d, and confirm’d by\r\na general Experience, the making an Act, to prohibit the Exportation of\r\nGreen Hydes, would be judged by all to be Adviseable, and Useful to the\r\nKingdom.\r\n\r\nWhen the apparent Qualities of Bark, are considered; and that by it’s\r\ninsinuating into the Pores, and incorporating with the Substance of\r\nthe Hyde, it produces a Firmness, Strength, and Consolidation of the\r\nParts; It is very surprizing, that other Materials, of the same Apparent\r\nQualities, have so long remained neglected, and unapplied to the same\r\nUses; when the Consequence is of such Moment.\r\n\r\n_Tormentil_, and _Cinquefoil_ Roots, are ranged in the same Medical\r\nClass; have the same apparent Qualities, especially the first, in a more\r\neminent, and evident Degree, than Bark, it self.\r\n\r\nOn Tryal, they have answered beyond Expectation: The _Cinquefoil_ did\r\nnot give so good a Colour, as the _Tormentil_, which in all Respects, as\r\nto Colour, Bloom, Substance, Solidity, and Weight, in the Tanned Hyde,\r\ncompleatly answered, and in much less Time, than when Bark, (even of the\r\nbest Kind, or Growth) is used.\r\n\r\nTho’, what is here asserted, is grounded on several Years Experience, and\r\nconfirmed by the Opinion and Testimony of Mr. _Philip Cooley_, Tanner,\r\nwho from the Beginning hath been concerned in the several Tryals, and\r\nto whose Skill and Industry a Part of the Subsequent is owing. Yet to\r\ngive the utmost Satisfaction, and as I think my self in the strongest\r\nManner bound by the Encouragement, hitherto given me, by the _House of\r\nCommons_, to render the best Information I am able, in an Affair of some\r\nConsequence to the Public, I shall give a most faithful Account of the\r\nProgress that has been made, and the Success that hath attended this\r\nWay of Tanning with relation to the Goodness of the Leather, the Time,\r\nand Charge of Tanning, and other Circumstances; and shall add several\r\nObservations, with Directions for finding, and propagating these Roots,\r\nin great Plenty, that all Persons may be encouraged to carry this Method\r\nof Tanning, into a general Practice, which as it will be for their\r\nprivate Advantage, so it will not fail to promote the Public Benefit.\r\n\r\nIn Order to this, I shall in the first Place beg Leave to place this\r\nAffair in the Light it appeared in before the _Committee_ of the _House\r\nof Commons_ of _Ireland_, to whom my Petition was referred by the\r\n_House_, in which Petition it was alledged, that I had established a\r\nMethod of Tanning, without the Use of any Barks, to as great Perfection,\r\ncheaper, and in less Time, than with Bark, by Vegetables of our Natural\r\nProduce, and of easy Culture.\r\n\r\nThe _Committee_, were pleased, for their greater Satisfaction, to summon\r\na Great Number of Tanners, Curriers, Shoemakers, and others, to attend,\r\nto give their Testimony in relation to the several Specimens, and Proofs,\r\nthat were to be laid before them.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the Goodness of the Leather, so tanned, the following\r\nSpecimens were exhibited.\r\n\r\nNᵒ. 1. A Calve’s Skin from the Ooze.\r\n\r\nNᵒ. 2. A Calve’s Skin, uncurryed.\r\n\r\nNᵒ. 3. A Calve’s Skin, curried: each of these, when tann’d and dry’d,\r\nweighing about three Pounds.\r\n\r\nNᵒ. 4. A Calve’s Skin, very strong and large, when tanned and dryed,\r\nweighing about Six Pounds.\r\n\r\nNᵒ. 5. Seven or Eight Pair of Soles, of a Calve’s Skin, rais’d.\r\n\r\nNᵒ. 6. A Bend of a Bullock’s Hyde for Harness.\r\n\r\nThese were all proved by _Thomas Cooley_ and _Patrick Shale_ to be tanned\r\nwithout Bark, and with the Roots.\r\n\r\nMr. _Henderson_, Master of the Tanners, said he was diffident of\r\nthe Goodness of the Specimens, that he should have been thoroughly\r\nsatisfyed: had he known, how the Leathers had proved, if worn, by some\r\nPorters, or Chairmen. That the Colour of Number 2, or 3, was not so good\r\nas some tanned with Bark, producing a Calve’s Skin curried, to compare\r\nwith them, but did own, all the Specimens were thoroughly struck, and\r\nwell tanned: That if they were in a Shop, intermixt with Skins, tanned by\r\nBark, he could not distinguish them; and that, what tanned Numb. 5 and 6,\r\nwould tann, Time and Quantity allowed, the thickest Bullock’s Hyde.\r\n\r\nMr. _Dobson_, Tanner, affirmed the Specimens were not well tanned,\r\nbecause they did not come up to the Colour of the Skin produced by Mr.\r\n_Henderson_, but in other Respects, the Leathers appeared, to be as good\r\nin their respective Kinds, as any tanned with Bark.\r\n\r\nMr. _Nicholas Gibson_, Master of the Curriers, affirmed that the Skin\r\nproduced by Mr. _Henderson_, was of an Extraordinary Colour; That there\r\nwere not ten such in _Dublin_; That the Difference in Colour was but very\r\nsmall, and in regard even to Colour, would choose those tanned by the\r\nVegetables, as soon as Mr. _Henderson_’s Skin; That all the Specimens\r\nappeared to be very well tanned, and that he could in no wise distinguish\r\nthem from Bark-Tannage.\r\n\r\nMr. _Devereux_, Currier, being sent out, returned, producing two Calves\r\nSkins tanned by Bark, which he took indifferently, and without choosing,\r\nfrom the next Currier’s Shop. They were allowed by all, to be of a\r\ngeneral or common Colour; and being compared were much exceeded by the\r\nSpecimens, and particularly, as to Colour.\r\n\r\nMr. _Edmund Sheild_, Currier, said he never saw better tanned Leather,\r\nthan the Specimens, that their Colour was very good and, that what tanned\r\nNumb. 5. would tann any Hyde, whatsoever.\r\n\r\nMr. _Brookfield_, Tanner, reported the Specimens exhibited, were well\r\ntanned and thoroughly struck; that neither He, or any other could\r\ndistinguish them, from Bark Tannage; and that what tanned Numb. 5, could\r\nnot fail in any Tannage.\r\n\r\nMr. _Veckers_, Tanner, allowed the Specimens to be very well tanned; and\r\ngave it, as his Opinion, that what tanned Numb. 5 and 6, would tann the\r\nthickest Sole Leather.\r\n\r\nMr. _John Gades_, Shoemaker, after giving his Testimony, that all the\r\nSpecimens appeared to be exceedingly well tanned, produced a Shoe, made\r\nby him, of the Leather of this Tannage, affirming the Leather, wrought\r\nvery well, and that the Soles exhibited, under the Hammer, all the Signs\r\nof extraordinary Leather.\r\n\r\nMr. _Ellis_, Shoemaker, reported the Specimens were very well tanned:\r\nThat, Leather either dead, or highly tanned, would never carry so\r\nbeautiful a Colour as Leather otherwise tanned. That, the Sole Leather\r\nappeared to be very well tanned; and that in his Opinion this Tannage,\r\nwould in every respect, answer the same End, or Intentions, as Bark\r\nTannage.\r\n\r\nMr. _James King_, Shoemaker, said all the Specimens, were effectually\r\ntanned.\r\n\r\nMr. _Richard Norris_, Shoemaker, produced a Sole of this Tannage, beaten;\r\nasserting he never saw so good a Sole of rais’d Calve’s Skin, that it\r\nbeat firm, solid, and without spreading, or Fuzziness: which are the\r\ndistinguishing Characters of good Sole Leather, he desired it might be\r\ncut in several Places, that the Closeness, and Firmness might be view’d,\r\nwhich accordingly was done, and answering Expectation was approved.\r\n\r\nThere were a great many other Tanners, Curriers, and Shoemakers, who were\r\nof the same Opinion. But considering, their Testimonies, would be but so\r\nmany Repititions; I shall not recite them.\r\n\r\nDr. _Richard Helsham_, Professor of Natural Philosophy in _Trinity\r\nCollege_, said I had communicated to him, what was used in this Tannage,\r\nwhich appeared to be well adapted to tanning, and would not fail to give\r\na sufficient Strength, and Rigidity to the Fibres. Adding he wore a pair\r\nof Shoes, the Upper Leathers of this Tannage, daily for four Months, and\r\nbeing willing to try the utmost of the Leather, had new Soles put to\r\nthem; that since he had worn them about a Month: showing them, without\r\nany Cracks, or Defect.\r\n\r\n_Patrick Carrol_, produced two Slips of curried Calf Skin; the one tanned\r\nby Bark, the other by the Roots, each three tenths of an Inch broad, and\r\nten Inches long, the first was the thickest, and weighed, a tenth Part\r\nmore than the other. He said, he was present with several others, when it\r\nbroke, by a Weight of 129 Pounds being hung to it; That the Slip of this\r\nnew Tannage, being tryed with the same Circumstances, bore 29 Pounds more\r\nthan the 129 Pounds, before it either yielded, or broke.\r\n\r\nIn respect to Time.\r\n\r\nThat the Specimens, Nᵒ. 1, 2 and 3 were tanned in five Weeks, Nᵒ. 4 in\r\nnine Weeks, Nᵒ. 5 in four Months, without any Hurry, extraordinary, or\r\nillegal Methods: was proved by Mr. _Thomas Cooley_, and _Patrick Shale_;\r\non the other Side, it appeared, that in tanning with Bark, from three\r\nto five Months were required for Calves Skins, from seven to nine were\r\nrequisite for Soles of rais’d Calves Skins, and from ten to thirteen\r\nMonths for Bullocks Hydes, which by this Tannage, may be effected in\r\nnine or ten.\r\n\r\nIn regard to Cheapness.\r\n\r\nMr. _Philip Cooley_, affirmed that six Pounds of the Dry Roots, added\r\nto some old expended Ooze, tanned Six Calves Skins, three of which were\r\nproduced under the Nᵒ. 1, 2, and 3; and that he believed sixteen Pounds\r\nwould have done as much from the first, or without any old Ooze.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the Cheapness.\r\n\r\nPart of the Roots, I have used, I purchased at three Farthings, the\r\nPound; but of late Years, and being willing to engage the Privacy of\r\nthe Gatherer; I have given a Penny; they lose about a third in Drying:\r\nAllowing these as Facts and taking it at the dearest, less than five\r\nShillings worth of Roots, will go farther, than a Barrel of the best Bark.\r\n\r\nAs to their Plenty and Propagation, Dr. _Helsham_ testified, they grew in\r\ngreat Plenty as he had observed, in several Counties of this Kingdom, and\r\nwere very easily propagated.\r\n\r\nDr. _William Stephens_, Botanic Professor in _Trinity College, Dublin_,\r\nin his Examination declared, that they grew in great Plenty about\r\n_Dublin_, and in several Counties he had observed great Quantities,\r\nchiefly on Mountains, and barren Places: That, they were easily to be\r\npropagated, in almost any kind of Soil, and that he had some flourishing\r\nin the Physick Garden, belonging to the University.\r\n\r\nThe Resolutions, that the House entred into _January 10_, might very well\r\nhave sufficed to have recommended a General Practice. But to remove some\r\nPrejudices and to obviate some false Representations, I have impartially\r\nrecited the several Facts and Testimonies, on which they were founded.\r\n\r\nThat all People may easily know and find out these Plants, I shall here\r\ngive a Description; which though tedious, I hope will be excused.\r\n\r\n_Cinquefoil_, in _Latin_, _Pentaphyllum vulgare_, in _Irish_, ~Tuigbeag~\r\n(_Tuigbeag_) ~Tuigvear Muirre~ (_Tuigvear Muirre_) and in some Counties,\r\n~Meagigh~, (_Meagigh_) is a Plant, whose Roots are very long, about\r\na Finger’s Thickness, of a dark brown or reddish Colour, and very\r\nastringent in Taste; the Leaves are born at the Extremity of a small\r\nStem, five together, deeply indented on their Edges, of an oblong Form\r\nand hairy; on the Grand Stem, at the Nodes, shoot forth several smaller,\r\nterminating with a small Yellow Flower, composed of six small Leaves\r\nsurrounding a Number of Threads, from whence ariseth a Cluster of Seeds.\r\n\r\nIt flourishes in every Hedge, sandy, loose and deep Soil: the Roots which\r\nare to be preferred, are the thick, long, and of the darkest Colour.\r\n\r\n_Tormentil_, or _Septfoil_, in _West Meath_, called ~Neauhnadis~\r\n(_Neauhnadis_) in _Ulster_, ~Menedin~ (_Menedin_) or ~Neauhnid~\r\n(_Neauhnid_) in _Connaught_, ~Levenet~ (_Levenet_) in the County of\r\n_Mayo_, ~Fenede na Muc~ (_Fenede na Muc_) this Plant, hath a thick,\r\ntuberous Root, of a reddish brown Colour, sometimes covered with a black\r\nSkin, of a very astringent Taste, and shooting out many Fibres; the\r\nLeaves are generally seven, set on the Extremity of a Foot Stalk, of a\r\ndark Green Colour, deeply indented on the Edges and hairy, from amidst\r\nthem ariseth several small weak Stalks, of a reddish Colour, and hairy,\r\nabout 12 or 18 Inches in Height, knotted; at every Knot, or Joint, is\r\na Foliage, and two or three Foot Stalks, some bearing Leaves, and one\r\nlonger than the rest the Flowers consisting of four Leaves, of a light\r\nYellow Colour, to which succeeds the Seeds; the flower Cup, hath Eight\r\nLeaves, four large and four small, the Root when Vigorous sends forth\r\nseveral Runners, the Stalks of which are of a reddish Colour, and hairy\r\nthat spread over the Ground; at every Joynt, from one Part ariseth two or\r\nthree Stems, each bearing at the Extremity five Leaves, from the other\r\nPart, descend several Fibres that become Roots.\r\n\r\nIt grows almost every where, but chiefly delights in mountainy, barren\r\nand shallow Soils; the Roots seldom striking four or five Inches deep.\r\nIt hath been observed by Dr. _Stephens_, to grow all along the Banks of\r\nthe _Doder_, from _Donore-Brook_ to _Old Baun_, upon Roch Town Hills; it\r\ngrows on the Borders of a great Bog for several Miles, by _Rathmullian_\r\nin the County of _Meath_. In the County of _Wicklow_, Thousands of\r\nCart-Loads might be with Ease collected; Nor do I know a Mountain or Bog\r\nwithout Plenty of it.\r\n\r\nIn the Figure, (_a_) denotes the Root, (_b_) the Flower in the Bud,\r\n(_c_) the Flower expanded, (_d_) the Knob of Seeds, (_e_) the Runners,\r\n(_f_) the Flower Cup. I have exhibited but few of the Leaves, Stems, and\r\nRunners to avoid Confusion.\r\n\r\nIt is observable, that from the Bark of the Stalk of this Plant, at\r\nits breaking forth from the Root, excrementitious Tubercles or Knots,\r\nresembling Oak-Galls have been often discovered, and like them are\r\nsubservient to the Propagation of Insects; which, considering the extream\r\nnice, and distinguishing Taste of those Animalculas, may well be allowed\r\nas a Proof, that their Juices are similar.\r\n\r\nThe Roots growing on Mountains are small, strong, and often have a black\r\nCoat; those that grow on the Sides of Loughs, and in Bogs, are large, of\r\na lighter Colour; some I have had of the Latter, that have weighed each\r\nabove half a Pound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen you chose the Roots, prefer the large, knotty Roots, that when\r\nbroken exhibit a blood red Tincture intermixt with the Brown, and those\r\nthat when cut, leaves on the Knife a strong purple Colour.\r\n\r\nThe best Time for collecting these Roots is in the Winter Season, or\r\nearly in the Spring, and tho’ the Seed-bearing Stalks, and Foliage are\r\ndecayed, yet there are several Foot Leaves, that remain and direct the\r\nInquirer.\r\n\r\nAnd tho’ these Plants grow wild all over the Country, in such Plenty,\r\nas to be more than sufficient to tann all the Hydes, and Skins of the\r\nKingdom; and little Apprehension of a Deficiency, for in digging up the\r\nRoots, there will be left some broken Parts, some Fibres, which will\r\nVegetate and give a Supply. A common Root, on a moderate Computation will\r\nproduce 8 or 10 hundred Seeds, these shedding, and dispersed by Winds,\r\nand other Accidents, some will take Root, and carry on a Succession.\r\n\r\nAnd in regard, it may be objected, that the Trouble and Expence, in\r\ngathering them, when in so dispers’d a Manner, would be very great; and\r\na constant Supply uncertain: And because the Roots, if raised in such\r\nSoils, as shall be found to agree with them, would thereby become larger,\r\nstronger, as well as cheaper, I have endeavoured the Culture, especially\r\nof the _Tormentil_, and with such Success, as to have from each square\r\nYard three Pounds weight of the Roots.\r\n\r\nAn Acre contains 7,840 square Yards; but, for Paths, Wastes, and\r\ninclosing, I would allow 1,800 Yards, not to be employed; As the first\r\nYear they will be little more than fibrous, I would allow three Years for\r\ntheir Growth, tho’, if another Year was added, the Crop by an Increase\r\nwould sufficiently reward, not only as to Quantity but Quality; as the\r\nbest of Lands are not required; I would state the Expence of that Culture\r\nas follows,\r\n\r\n    Three Years Rent at 5_s._ the Acre,  0 15 0\r\n    Plowing twice and Harrowing,         0 12 6\r\n    Planting,                            0  7 6\r\n    Houghing,                            1\r\n    Digging up the Roots,                1\r\n                                         ------\r\n                                  Total  3 15 0\r\n\r\nSuppose each square Yard, should produce but the Moiety of what before\r\nwas mentioned, and sold but at three farthings the Pound, the Amount will\r\nbe 27_l._ 3_s._ 6_d._ from whence a Profit ariseth beyond most of our\r\nCultures, now in general Use, and the Tannage may be accomplished, at\r\nabout a Moiety of the present Expence.\r\n\r\nProbably, this Estimate of the Charge and Profit, may not be so exact\r\nas to be strenuously defended; but if defective, there is Room enough\r\nfor any reasonable Addition or Deduction, without much Prejudice to\r\nthe Argument; different Soils, often one and the same will be attended\r\nwith different Charges; The finer, the Earth is made, or the more it\r\nis broken, before Planting the better Vegetation succeeds; at first\r\nshooting up of the Herbage, particularly where the Ground is foul,\r\nhoughing, or pulling up the large Weeds, will be necessary, that the\r\nGrowth of the _Tormentil_ may not be chequed; in a little Time it will\r\nclear its self. As the Roots run superficially, not streeking at most 5\r\nor 6 Inches in perpendicular Depth, the Charge of digging them up cannot\r\nbe so much, as that which attends Potatoes.\r\n\r\nThe Propagation may be effected by planting the Crowns of the Roots,\r\n(that Part, from whence the Herbage ariseth) in either Autumn or Spring,\r\nin the same manner as Horse Raddish, splitting the Crown, so as to leave\r\na Bud on every Slice, then setting them in the Ground, about an Inch in\r\nDepth and allowing each Set, 5 or 6 Inches square of Ground. When you\r\ntake up a Plantation, you will have an Abundance of small Roots that\r\narose from the shedding of the Seed, and from the Runners, that will\r\nscarce be worth the Drying, but very proper for Planting: If you cut from\r\neither Extremity of the Root, a Piece of about half an Inch in Length,\r\nit will grow very well. The whole Root, if cut into such Pieces, may be\r\nplanted. In all these I believe the Charge of Planting might be saved; if\r\nyou scatter them before Harrow, the passing of that over them, will cover\r\nthem with Earth sufficient; or at least, the most Part of them.\r\n\r\nYou may Plant the Runners, as you do Strawberries, in the mention’d\r\nSeasons and Distances, and considering the Numbers of fibrous Roots,\r\nalready shot forth, it may be allowed the speediest Method.\r\n\r\nThe Seeds ripen about _August_ or _September_, when ripe, they are of\r\nbrownish Colour; as they are very apt to shed, the Time of ripening must\r\nbe heedfully regarded; It would be adviseable to cut the Hawm or Herbage,\r\na little time before the Seeds ripen, laying it on a Cloth, or winnowing\r\nSheet in the Sun, when dry, rub the Seeds out with your Hands, and\r\nseparate them from the Chaff. In _March_ the Ground being prepared, you\r\nmay sow and harrow, or rake them into the Ground.\r\n\r\nThe Cutting of the young Stems, if planted in _May_, will grow.\r\n\r\nThe Roots when collected, are to be washed very clean, from the Earth\r\nthat will remain with them, for otherwise, that Dirt when in the Layers,\r\nsettleth into the Pores of the Hyde or Skin, and causeth Numbers of\r\nSpots, and Discolourations.\r\n\r\nIn fair Weather, it not being a succulent Root, they will sufficiently\r\ndry if spread on a Floor, or a clean Part of the Field; a little Wet,\r\nwill in no case damage them. In case of very wet Weather, and continued,\r\nthey may be Kiln dryed, in the same Manner as Bark.\r\n\r\nWhen dryed, they must be bruised or ground, either more or less,\r\naccording to the Uses design’d, or to the Proportion you require them to\r\nspend in. In case they should not be sufficiently washt, when they are\r\npounded, or ground a little, it would be adviseable to sift the Dirt, or\r\nEarth, which by this Means is broken, and seperated from them.\r\n\r\nWhen thus prepared, you must proceed in the same Manner, and lay away,\r\nintirely, with the same Circumstances as with Bark.\r\n\r\nIt hath often been objected, That if this Method should obtain, Planting\r\nwould be discouraged, and so prejudice the landed Interest. That it is\r\nused in the _Canary Islands_ and that though it may be done effectually\r\nthere, yet the Produce of our Country might have Qualities very\r\ndifferent, or not exalted to such a Degree, as to be of a requisite Force.\r\n\r\nTo these, I would answer.\r\n\r\nThat Bark would always bear a Price, in Proportion to the Rate of what is\r\nsubstituted in lieu thereof; It would be far from being rendered useless,\r\nbut only suffer a Diminution in Value.\r\n\r\nThat Diminution would be more than ballanced by the accelerated Growth,\r\nand Worth of the Timber. At present we fall our Woods so young, and\r\nat such improper Seasons, on Account of the Bark, that the Timber is\r\nneither so good, and little more than fit for Ribberies, and Cabbins;\r\nwhereas otherwise, was the present Inducement, the great Price of Bark\r\ndiminished, we should have full, and well grown Timber, cut at a due\r\nSeason, and proper for Edifices, and Shipping.\r\n\r\nThe Improvement of those Lands that now are unprofitable, or not far\r\nfrom such, would be another Ballance, if not wholly, yet in Part, to the\r\napprehended Injury.\r\n\r\nThe Use of this Root hath not been confined to the _Canaries_. The\r\nReverend Mr. _Lucas Jacobson Debes_, in his History of the Islands of\r\n_Feroe_ says Page 120, “Here groweth a huge Quantity of _Tormentil_,\r\nwhich the Inhabitants, having no Bark of Trees to tan their Hydes with,\r\nmake Use of; God and Nature having revealed to them the Dryness of that\r\nHerb, so that they tan their Skins with it, and therefore call it Bark.”\r\nAnd Page 271. “The Men wear Shoes of Neats Leather, tanned with the Roots\r\nof _Tormentil_.”\r\n\r\nThe first of these Islands, is in the Latitude of 28, the other in 62.\r\nYet we find the same Roots used for the same Purposes, though probably\r\nthey may differ in Degrees of Power.\r\n\r\nA great Degree of Heat is not a Quality requisite to the Perfection of\r\nall Vegetables. _Saffron_ in _France_ exceeds the Produce of _Spain_, as\r\nmuch as the little we have in _Ireland_ excells the Product of _England_.\r\n\r\nOur Temperate Climate seems in some Degree, to be more adapted to\r\nVegetables of this Species of Power, than those that are deemed hot. Our\r\nBark is allowed to excel the Bark of those warmer Climates, as also our\r\nTimber.\r\n\r\nIt is a contested Point, whether the _Tormentil_ is not the Plant, the\r\n_Greeks_ called _Britanica_; probably so named from its plentiful Growth\r\nin that Island.\r\n\r\nOne great Advantage, arising from this Tannage should it become general,\r\nwill be, that it will give Imployment to a great many Poor People,\r\nthat will be set to work in gathering, or raising such a Quantity of\r\nthose Roots, as will answer the present annual Import of Bark; as also\r\nthe Tannage of some, if not the Whole of those Hydes, we now export\r\nunwrought; besides the great Numbers, that will be employed in the\r\nencreased Tannage.\r\n\r\nThus, with as much Brevity, as the Nature of the Subject would admit of,\r\nI have given a Narrative, of what I hope will be as satisfactory, on a\r\ncandid Perusal as I am assured, it will be beneficial to the Publick, in\r\nall its Consequences; if the Method laid down be but pursued with common\r\nCare, and Assiduity. It requiring no greater Skill than what at present\r\nis used in Bark Tannage; no Alterations in Forms, or Utensils.\r\n\r\nIf the Instructions, laid down, should appear to Any insufficient, or\r\nimperfect; I shall always with Pleasure be ready to render them, if in my\r\nPower otherwise. I have made a Plantation, very near this City, that if\r\nthe Curiosity of Any should prompt them to a farther Information, in that\r\nParticular, they there may meet with it. As this Tannage is constantly\r\ncarried on; it is open to the View of Any that desire it. I have several\r\nThousands of Pounds weight of these Roots by me; I never refusing the\r\nbuying of any brought to me. If any Tanner wants, he may have it at\r\nthe Price, I gave to the Countryman, or be directed where, or how to be\r\nsupply’d, until a Demand makes it a Market Commodity.\r\n\r\nOur Necessities, and those daily encreasing, first prompted to this\r\nEssay. The Authority of Books, I have not relied on, but a Series of\r\nExperiments that employed several Years in the Pursuit. If I have pointed\r\nout, or cleared from Incumbrances, an advantageous Path that may lessen\r\nthe Import of Bark, extend our Tannage by our own Produce, and give a\r\nSupport to any Number of Poor; I regard it in no other Sense, than having\r\ndone Part of that Duty, I owe to a Country, which in Gratitude, I would\r\ncall mine.\r\n\r\nI might justly incur a severe Censure, if I should conclude, without\r\ntestifying with all due Acknowledgements, a grateful Sense of my\r\nObligations, to the Honourable _House of Commons_, for the Vote they were\r\npleased to pass in my Favour, on the Report of the _Committee_; that I\r\nhad, after a full Enquiry, answered the Allegations of my Petition; and\r\nfor the Resolution, they entred into, of giving all proper Encouragement\r\nto so useful a Proposal.\r\n\r\nFar from being insensible, that all new Attempts of this Kind, are apt\r\nto subject the Author of them, to the Name of a Projector, and render\r\nhim the Object of Reproach and Suspicion; when I was fully satisfied in\r\nthe Facts, on which this Method is grounded; I communicated it to some\r\nPersons, who are as little liable to be impos’d on themselves, as they\r\nare above all Suspicion of imposing on others; under the Sanction of\r\nwhole Characters, such an Imputation would at once be removed. By their\r\nDirections I preferred my Petition, and notwithstanding the Success was\r\nnot altogether such as they desired; I hope they will not deny me the\r\nindulging a sincere Gratitude, in particulary owning the Obligations\r\nto them, who so warmly espoused my Interest, grounded upon that of the\r\nNation. I shall venture to say no more, than as I flatter my self they\r\ncan clear me from any Imputations of Sinister or Mercenary Views; So I\r\ncan promise my Endeavours shall always tend to hinder a Blush, for the\r\nKind Representations, they have been pleased to make in my Favour; and\r\nthat I shall always study to approve my self what is my chiefest Ambition\r\nto be, and what only intitles me to their Patronage; a Pretender to no\r\nother merit, but Plain dealing.\r\n\r\nI should have published this sooner, but that I waited the Success\r\nof some repeated, as well as new Experiments; all which on the\r\nbest Examination I am capable of making, have tended to an intire\r\nConfirmation; That the _Tormentil_ Roots Tan all Hydes and Skins\r\nas effectually, cheaper, and in less Time than Bark, and is easily\r\npropagated.\r\n\r\n_FINIS._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's A Method of Tanning without Bark, by William Maple",
