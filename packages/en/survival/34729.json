Special attention has been given to the production of\r\ncotton in infested districts and to showing how to adopt a system of\r\nfarming which has been found profitable by many farmers in boll weevil\r\nterritories. It was written by a man who has had practical experience all\r\nhis life in growing cotton in Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas. He later\r\ndevoted a number of years to the special study of the boll weevil in the\r\ncotton fields of these states as special agent for the Farmers'\r\nCo-operative Demonstration Work. In addition to this, he is acquainted\r\nwith the financial and economic conditions throughout the cotton belt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDedicated to all Cotton Growers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Prosper in Boll Weevil Territory\r\n\r\nThe System of Farming Necessary to Obtain Best Results Under Average\r\nConditions in Boll Weevil Territory\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain profitable returns from farming in boll weevil\r\nterritory, we must--First, grow an early crop of cotton; second, use every\r\nmeans possible to destroy the weevil and reduce their number to a minimum;\r\nthird, follow a system of diversified farming.\r\n\r\n=Grow an Early Variety of Cotton:= To secure maximum cotton crops in spite\r\nof the boll weevil pest, the cotton grower must use every effort to bring\r\nthe crop to maturity just as early in the season as possible. An early\r\ncrop means profit--a late crop goes to the weevil, not to the farmer. If\r\nwe are to succeed in growing cotton under boll weevil conditions we must--\r\n\r\n1. Reduce the cotton acreage so that the most effective cultural methods\r\nmay be closely followed. It is often advisable to reduce the acreage 50\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\n2. Plant only warm, fertile, well-drained land.\r\n\r\n3. Thoroughly prepare the seed bed before planting. Young cotton plants do\r\nnot grow well in cloddy ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boll Weevil; enlarged above; natural size below]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Make heavy applications of commercial fertilizer where the soil\r\nresponds to such treatment, for it will hasten maturity and increase the\r\nyield.\r\n\r\n5. Plant early, rapid-fruiting, prolific cotton seed.\r\n\r\n6. Plant the seed as early as the season will permit, in rows just about\r\nas wide apart as the cotton usually grows tall in the average season.\r\n\r\n7. Commence to cultivate the young cotton just as soon as possible, and do\r\nnot permit a crust to form or the field to become grassy.\r\n\r\n=Reduce the Cotton Acreage:= In many sections of the country, intensive\r\nfarming--smaller farms and more thorough cultivation--is being profitably\r\npracticed. In boll weevil territory, we would likewise advocate\r\n\"intensive\" cotton growing--smaller acreage to cotton with more thorough\r\ncultivation--as a good step toward securing early and profitable cotton\r\ncrops. For instance, many farmers in the boll weevil territory are now\r\nproducing as much cotton on five acres by following proper methods as they\r\nformerly produced on ten acres, thus leaving half of their land to produce\r\nsome other crop.\r\n\r\n=Plant on Fertile Soil:= This is one of the necessities in order to\r\nproduce an early cotton crop. The land must be well-drained so that it\r\nwill warm up early in the spring and retain the heat. It must contain\r\nplenty of humus or vegetable matter to prevent packing. Plenty of\r\nvegetable matter also increases the water-holding capacity of the soil,\r\nthus reducing the loss due to the droughts that may occur in summer. Where\r\nthe soil has not enough humus and therefore will not hold a sufficient\r\namount of water, the cotton crop will stop growing and putting on squares\r\nduring a long drought, and will shed the squares and many of the small\r\nbolls already on the stalks.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: At left of each pair is a boll weevil. The weevils at the\r\nright are weevils often mistaken for boll weevils.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soil may be kept in the proper condition of fertility for cotton by\r\npracticing a suitable rotation of crops, including legumes, and by turning\r\nunder the corn stalks, the oat and pea stubble, and the grass.\r\n\r\n=Thoroughly Prepare the Soil:= The soil should be plowed deep for the\r\nfollowing reasons: First, to increase the water-holding capacity; second,\r\nto let the water escape from the surface without running over the ground\r\nand washing it off; third, to permit the air to circulate freely for a\r\nconsiderable depth in the soil; fourth, to secure crops against droughts\r\nby enabling the cotton roots to go down to moisture; fifth, to increase\r\nthe area from which plant roots may obtain food. It is advisable to flat\r\nbreak the land in the fall and winter and then bed it some time before the\r\nplanting season. The bed should be disked or harrowed just before planting\r\nthe cotton seed, but it is seldom advisable to re-bed the land just before\r\nplanting. Cotton comes up quicker, grows off faster and begins bearing\r\nsooner on a well settled, firm seed bed. It is not wise to plant the\r\ncotton on freshly prepared land.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The late cotton is for weevil--not for the farmer. The boll\r\nweevil prevented the above late cotton from making a single boll.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Apply Commercial Fertilizers:= Where the soil responds to commercial\r\nfertilizer, it is advisable to make heavy applications to hasten maturity\r\nand increase the yield. It is best to use fertilizers which will stimulate\r\nthe fruit rather than stalk growth. High grade, 16 per cent acid phosphate\r\nis the basis for increasing fruit and hastening maturity; cotton seed meal\r\nis usually the basis for stimulating stalk growth. A mixture of two parts\r\nof 16 per cent acid phosphate and one part of 6 per cent cotton seed meal\r\nis a good mixture for cotton on soil of average fertility.\r\n\r\nIt will usually also pay to mix about ten pounds of nitrate of soda with\r\nevery bushel of seed just before it is put into the planter. The nitrate\r\nof soda has a tendency to cause the young cotton to grow vigorously and\r\nresist the bad effects of cool nights. It also usually pays to make a side\r\napplication of nitrate of soda just after the cotton has been thinned the\r\nfirst time.\r\n\r\n=Plant Early Varieties:= The production of an early cotton crop requires\r\ncarefully selected seed of an early, rapid-fruiting, prolific variety.\r\nThis seed may be purchased each year, or selected from cotton plants with\r\nlow fruit limbs and short joints on the main stem and fruit limbs. With\r\nthe weevil pest to combat, the value of using the earliest and most\r\nprolific seed cannot be over-estimated.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable for the average farmer to buy the best early varieties\r\nfrom some reputable breeder and then use every known method to increase\r\nthe earliness and productiveness of the cotton. Reports of tests at the\r\nGovernment Experiment Stations name the earliest and most prolific\r\nvarieties of cotton. It is not good business to buy varieties of seed that\r\nhave not been shown to be the earliest and most prolific by actual tests\r\nin the fields through a sufficient number of years to eliminate weather\r\nconditions. Seed should not be purchased because of high-sounding names or\r\nexaggerated claims.\r\n\r\n=Plant the Seed Early:= Seed should be planted just as early as the season\r\nwill permit. This is important in the work of hastening the cotton crop to\r\nearly maturity. The weevils do not multiply until the squares begin to\r\nform. They seldom become sufficiently numerous to destroy the squares as\r\nfast as they form, before the last of July. While it is important to plant\r\nas early as the season will permit, do not forget that cotton is a\r\ntropical plant and is badly effected by cold weather.\r\n\r\n=Cultivate the Young Cotton:= Cultivation should begin before the cotton\r\ncomes up. This may be done by running a steel peg tooth harrow over the\r\nfield either at right angles or diagonally across the rows. This helps to\r\nlet the young cotton plants through and at the same time kills millions of\r\ntiny weeds and much grass just as they are coming up. The cultivation\r\nshould be repeated when the little cotton is about five days old. This\r\nearly cultivation kills the grass and weeds in the sprout and forms a soil\r\nmulch all over the field, which holds the moisture in the ground, thus\r\nmaking the little plants grow more rapidly. Early cultivation with the\r\nharrow will reduce the necessary work with the hoe to the minimum.\r\n\r\nIf for any reason the peg tooth harrow cannot be used, the ordinary\r\none-horse harrows should be used to stir the soil on top of the beds just\r\nbefore the cotton comes up. The harrow or cultivator used will kill the\r\nlittle grass and weeds and leave a shallow, loose layer of soil on the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nAll later cultivation should be made with such implements as the one or\r\ntwo-horse cultivators, disk harrows and heel sweeps. A turning plow is out\r\nof place in a cotton field unless the soil is devoid of vegetable matter\r\nand runs together after heavy rains or unless it rains for two or three\r\nweeks and it becomes necessary to plow under the grass. If the soil packs\r\nafter heavy rains, it may be advisable to use the turning plow as a\r\nnecessary evil, especially, when the cotton is young. If it should be\r\nnecessary to use it to loosen the soil or to clean out the crop, by all\r\nmeans avoid deep cultivation late in the season. Be sure to use the\r\nharrow or cultivator a few days after using the turning plow to thoroughly\r\npulverize the stirred soil and make a dust mulch.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The upper illustration shows a cotton field planted late\r\nand yielding nothing. The lower illustration shows a field on the opposite\r\nside of the turnrow on same plantation, planted early, properly treated,\r\nand yielding three-quarters bale per acre. (Houter, Yearbook, U. S. Dept.\r\nof Agriculture, 1906.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe essential thing in the cultivation of the cotton is to keep the ground\r\nfree from grass and weeds and covered with a soil mulch. Frequent and\r\nshallow cultivation should be continued until the cotton begins to open.\r\nMost of the benefits of thorough preparation, early, rapid-fruiting seed,\r\nearly planting and intensive, shallow cultivation may be lost unless the\r\nfields are given the utmost attention until the cotton begins to open.\r\nFrequent and shallow cultivation late in the season will not result in the\r\ndeath of many adult weevils, but it will knock many punctured squares to\r\nthe hot ground and cause the cotton to remain green and continue to grow\r\nand put on squares to furnish food for the boll weevil. The boll weevil\r\nprefers squares to bolls and as long as the cotton puts on sufficient\r\nsquares to furnish it with the necessary food it will not attack many\r\nbolls.\r\n\r\nAvoid deep cultivation late in the season, especially close to the cotton.\r\nIf the plows cut the roots and cause the cotton to cease to put on squares\r\nthe weevil will at once attack the bolls, which would otherwise not be\r\ninjured.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: More and better corn must be grown in weevil territory.\r\nAbove corn grown on I H C farm, Brookhaven, Miss.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Reduce Boll Weevil\r\n\r\nBest Methods of Reducing the Number of Weevil to a Minimum--Results of\r\nMany Experiments Conducted\r\n\r\n\r\nRemarkable results and profitable returns have been obtained by carefully\r\napplying the following methods of destroying the boll weevil:\r\n\r\n1. Completely strip the cotton stalks of foliage, squares, and bolls--the\r\nweevils' sole food supply--plow the cotton stalks under good and deep, or\r\nburn them at the earliest possible moment.\r\n\r\n2. During the winter, destroy the rubbish in and about the fields, which\r\nmight serve as hibernating quarters for weevils.\r\n\r\n3. When the weevils appear on the new cotton in the spring, pick them off\r\nand destroy them.\r\n\r\n4. Pick up all punctured squares and destroy them for at least one month\r\nafter the first squares form on the cotton.\r\n\r\n=Importance of Destroying the Food Supply:= The most important step in\r\nproducing cotton in boll weevil territory is the early fall destruction of\r\nthe foliage, squares, and immature punctured bolls on the cotton stalks,\r\nwhich constitute the weevils' only food supply. Thousands of\r\nexperimenters, including the United States Bureau of Entomology,\r\nGovernment Agents in Farm Demonstration Work, the Louisiana State Crop\r\nPest Commission, and thousands of successful farmers substantiate this\r\nstatement that the early fall destruction of the cotton stalks is the most\r\neffective method that can be employed for the reduction of the number of\r\nweevil.\r\n\r\nAn experiment conducted by the Bureau of Entomology in Calhoun County,\r\nTexas, showed that where the stalks on 410 acres of land were destroyed\r\nearly in October, that the yield was increased $14.56 per acre. Another\r\nexperiment was conducted on opposite sides of the Guadaulope River near\r\nVictoria, Texas. The stalks were burned on one farm the latter part of\r\nSeptember and on the other they were allowed to stand until planting time.\r\nForty acres, on the farm on which the stalks were destroyed, produced\r\nfifteen bales of cotton. Forty acres on the other farm made three and\r\none-half bales.\r\n\r\nExperiments conducted by the Louisiana State Crop Pest Commission are\r\nsummed up in the following extracts from Circular No. 28: \"Where the\r\ncotton plants were destroyed before October 15, only 3 per cent of the\r\nweevils survived the winter to infest the next year's crop. Where the\r\nstalks were destroyed from October 15 to October 27, an average of about\r\n15 per cent of the weevils passed through the winter successfully. Where\r\nthe stalks were destroyed between November 1 and November 25, an average\r\nof approximately 22 per cent of the weevil survived the winter. Postponing\r\nthe fall destruction of cotton stalks until the middle of December, or\r\nlater, permitted over 43 per cent of the weevils to survive the winter\r\nand attack the next crop.\" _Where the stalks were destroyed before October\r\n15, only 3 per cent of the weevils passed the winter. Where the stalks\r\nremained in the field until December 15, over 43 per cent of the weevils\r\nsurvived the winter._ These figures certainly emphasize very strikingly\r\nthe value of early fall destruction of the boll weevil's food supply.\r\n\r\n=Methods of Destroying the Food Supply:= With the importance of early fall\r\ndestruction of the cotton stalks fully realized, the cotton grower has\r\nbefore him the question of how best to accomplish this. There are three\r\nmethods of destroying the squares, bolls, and foliage of the cotton\r\nstalks: 1. Pasturing; 2. Plowing under; 3. Burning.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A mature cotton plant that was late in fruiting. The joints\r\nare long and the balls far out from the center and base of the stalk. The\r\nlimbs have few joints and few bolls. Height of plant, 3 feet; balls 26--10\r\nin lower half circle. Do not plant this type in weevil territory.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPasturing the cotton fields is a good method of destroying squares, bolls\r\nand foliage where the cotton fields are fenced and where a sufficient\r\nnumber of cattle can be turned into a field to eat all the squares, bolls,\r\nand foliage in a few days. However, let it be distinctly understood that\r\nthe practice of turning just a few head of cattle into a fifteen or twenty\r\nacre cotton field accomplishes no particular good. Every cotton grower\r\nknows from his own observation that two or three head of cattle to an\r\nacre, even when confined entirely to the cotton field, will eat very\r\nlittle of the green foliage in one week, and it must be kept in mind that\r\nit is vital to destroy as quickly and as completely as possible the food\r\nsupply of the mature weevils and the breeding places of the immature\r\nweevils.\r\n\r\nPlowing cotton stalks under is an effective method of destroying the food\r\nsupply of mature weevils and ending the lives of immature weevils where\r\nthere are few stumps and roots, where the cotton stalks are small, and\r\nwhere large plows and strong teams can be had. Farmers who have attempted\r\nto plow under green cotton stalks early in the fall, laugh at the advice\r\nsometimes given to plow under the stalks at all times and under all\r\nconditions as a means of destroying the food supply of the weevil. They\r\nknow from experience that such advice is often better theory than practice\r\nas the plowing under of green cotton stalks is very often a decidedly\r\nobstinate proposition. However, where large plows and strong teams are\r\navailable, use them and completely bury the cotton stalks wherever it can\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Velvet beans yield abundant crops and add nitrogen to the\r\nsoil. A good crop for weevil territory]\r\n\r\n\r\nBurning the stalks is a practical method of destroying the weevils. On\r\nmany farms and plantations there are not cattle enough to strip the cotton\r\nstalks thoroughly and completely of every particle of foliage, squares and\r\nbolls in a short time by pasturing. It is also often impossible to\r\ncompletely bury the cotton stalks. In such cases, it is absolutely\r\nnecessary to cut, dry and burn them as soon as the cotton can be picked.\r\nBy burning the stalks, the food supply of the adult weevil is destroyed,\r\nand weevils in immature stages in the squares and bolls are destroyed. A\r\nlarge majority of the adult weevils also perish in the flames, especially\r\nwhen the stalks are burned after sundown, as weevils retire to the stalk\r\npiles for the night at about that time. They seldom move about at night,\r\nand if care is taken not to disturb them when applying the torch,\r\npractically all will be destroyed.\r\n\r\nOf course, if the stalks are allowed to remain until a heavy frost has\r\ncome, practically all of the mature weevils will have gone into winter\r\nhibernating quarters and the immature weevils in the squares and small\r\nbolls will have been frozen. Nothing will be gained in that case by\r\nburning the stalks and the best thing that can be done will be to cut the\r\nstalks and turn them under as deeply as possible.\r\n\r\n=Clean Up Hibernating Quarters:= Many weevils escape from the fields but\r\nall do not fly beyond the reach of the farmer. Surprising numbers have\r\nbeen found hibernating in cracks and holes in the ground and under grass,\r\nweeds and other trash. In January, 1907, in one instance, the United\r\nStates Bureau of Entomology found 5,870 weevils per acre of which 70 per\r\ncent were alive. Most of the many examinations that have been made have\r\nshown more than one thousand live weevils per acre in the cotton fields.\r\nMany are found along the fence rows, hedges, ditch banks and in decayed\r\nlogs and dead trees. Thousands more are found hibernating in nearby\r\ncornfields and old sorghum, cane and hay fields.\r\n\r\nWinter plowing of all cultivated fields is therefore another effective way\r\nof reducing the number of weevils, as the thousand or more weevils per\r\nacre in the cracks and holes in the ground and under the grass, weeds,\r\ntrash and cornstalks can practically all be killed by deep winter\r\nbreaking.\r\n\r\n=Picking Off the Weevils:= After the hibernating weevils emerge from their\r\nwinter quarters in the spring and reach the young cotton, there is little\r\nfurther movement until the general dispersing season in August, September\r\nand October. The fact that the weevil does not move about much except in\r\nthe fall makes it possible for the individual farmer to accomplish results\r\nfrom his own efforts in fighting the pest. There is little danger of\r\nweevils coming in from other fields until in August, by which time the\r\ncotton crop is normally set. For this reason, there need be no fear that\r\ntime will be wasted which is spent in thoroughly picking off the weevils\r\nfrom the young cotton plants before the squares begin to form.\r\n\r\nWhere the food supply of the weevil has not been destroyed early in the\r\nfall and strength added to this blow by plowing under the corn stalks,\r\ntrash, weeds and other vegetable matter that serve as hibernating\r\nquarters, and by destroying practically all of the weevils hibernating\r\nalong the fence rows, hedges and ditch banks, the over-wintered weevils\r\nare often sufficiently numerous to puncture all the squares as fast as\r\nthey form. Where this is the case, no bottom crop and seldom a middle crop\r\nof cotton will be made unless the weevils are picked off and the punctured\r\nsquares destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An early cotton plant. The fruit limbs are low and close\r\ntogether on the stalk and the joints are short. Plants of this structure\r\nfruit early, rapidly and are well adapted to boll weevil conditions.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe possible progeny of a single pair of weevils, during a season, has\r\nbeen estimated at 12,755,100. Nature has provided a number of agencies to\r\nprevent such excessive multiplication; nevertheless, the picking off of a\r\nsingle pair of weevils from the young cotton plants may mean millions less\r\nlater on.\r\n\r\nBefore squares form on the cotton, the over-wintered weevils that have\r\ncome out of winter quarters feed on the opening leaves or buds of the\r\nyoung cotton plants. Early in the morning it is an easy matter to find the\r\nweevils in the buds, where they can be easily picked off and destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe only reason why the weevils cannot be eradicated by thoroughly picking\r\nthem off, is that large numbers of over-wintered weevils do not emerge\r\nuntil after the squares begin to form. As soon as the squares form, the\r\nweevil gets on the inside of the bracts and feeds only by inserting its\r\nbeak deep into the squares. After the squares begin to form, it is hardly\r\npracticable to pick the weevils off.\r\n\r\n=Destroy All Punctured Squares:= The weevils that survive the winter are\r\nall in the adult stage. They breed only in the squares and bolls and\r\ntherefore cannot multiply until squares form. The most conspicuous\r\nindication of the presence of the boll weevil is the flaring of the\r\nsquare. When the weevil punctures a square, it turns yellow and the bracts\r\nflare open. The punctured squares usually fall to the ground in a few\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThe over-wintered weevils live only a few weeks after coming out of winter\r\nquarters in the spring, as they die shortly after breeding in the squares\r\nand bolls. Therefore, if the young cotton plants are thoroughly picked two\r\nor three times just before the squares begin to form, and every punctured\r\nsquare is destroyed for at least one month after the first squares form,\r\npractically all of the over-wintered weevils will be dead and hence there\r\nwill be few young weevils later on. If it were possible to destroy every\r\npunctured square and boll, and thereby prevent the appearance of new\r\nbroods, the weevil pest could be exterminated in one year. At any rate,\r\nthe results that can be accomplished behoove every farmer to work\r\ncarefully and painstakingly to destroy all the punctured squares possible\r\nbefore the new broods of weevils are hatched.\r\n\r\nDuring the growing season, many weevils can be destroyed by co-operating\r\nwith the natural agencies that tend to reduce their number. For instance,\r\nthe weevils in the punctured squares that fall on the hot ground in July\r\nand August and are not shaded, are usually killed at once by the heat or\r\nwill starve for lack of food, because of the hardening of the square. By\r\nusing a brush on the cultivators to agitate the plants when cultivating\r\nthe crop, many punctured squares will be knocked off onto the hot ground\r\nsooner than they would naturally fall off. At the same time, some of the\r\nadult weevils will also be shaken off onto the hot ground. When an adult\r\nweevil is thrown on a surface of finely pulverized, hot soil, it is killed\r\nalmost instantly.\r\n\r\n=Attempts to Destroy Weevils with Poison:= In territory newly infested\r\nwith the boll weevil, attempts continue to be made to destroy the weevils\r\nby poisoning. Of course the farmers soon learn better, but the experience\r\nis very expensive. If advocates of poison would only remember that after\r\nthe squares begin to form on the cotton, the boll weevils feed only by\r\ninserting their beaks deeply into the squares or bolls, they would realize\r\nthat it is impossible to place poison where the weevils will feed upon it.\r\nIn all the experiments performed in the field by the United States Bureau\r\nof Entomology, very heavy applications throughout the season have failed\r\nto show any advantage in the use of poison. Therefore, do not waste any\r\nmoney on poisons.\r\n\r\n=Not Attracted by Light:= The weevil seldom moves at night. It is inactive\r\nafter sundown. The weevil is never attracted to lights and hence the use\r\nof a trap lantern has no effect on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Good corn must be grown in weevil territory]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cotton Boll Weevil\r\n\r\nIts History, Habits, Food Supply and Life Rate of Increase and Damage Done\r\nto Crops\r\n\r\n\r\n=History:= The cotton boll weevil is not a native of the United States. It\r\ncame from Mexico in 1892. It may have flown across the Rio Grande River\r\nnear Brownsville, Texas, or it is possible that it was carried across in\r\nseed cotton. Since 1892, it has extended its range annually from fifty to\r\none hundred and twenty-five miles until it has spread over Texas,\r\nOklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi and a part of Alabama.\r\n\r\n=Life and Habits:= The eggs are laid within the squares and bolls of the\r\ncotton plant. The weevil prefers the squares and seldom punctures a boll\r\nas long as there are numerous squares to puncture. The mouth of the adult\r\nweevil is located at the end of the snout. The weevil eats a small hole\r\ninto the square or boll and then turns around and deposits one egg in the\r\npuncture and seals the hole with a small drop of a gluey substance to\r\nprotect the egg from ants, rain and other destructive agencies. The weevil\r\nseldom deposits more than one egg in a square or boll until the squares\r\nand bolls become very scarce. The egg hatches in from three to fifteen\r\ndays, depending on the temperature. The larvae is a tiny white footless\r\ngrub, with a brown head and dark jaws. This grub feeds on the inside of\r\nthe square or boll and passes into the pupae stage in from six to twelve\r\ndays. The adult or mature weevil develops from the pupae stage in three to\r\nten days and eats its way out of the square or boll.\r\n\r\n=How to Know a Boll Weevil:= The safest plan for one who is not well\r\nacquainted with the boll weevil is to send any doubtful specimen to an\r\nentomologist or to a government expert. There are a few characteristics,\r\nhowever, that will assist anyone in separating the boll weevil from the\r\nnumerous other weevils that are often mistaken for it. On each front leg\r\nof the boll weevil are two spines--one somewhat larger than the other. The\r\nsnout has a black shining appearance and the \"feelers\" are near the outer\r\nend. The boll weevil is usually from one-fourth to three-eighths of an\r\ninch long and about half as broad. When they first come from the square or\r\nboll, they are almost pink but rapidly turn darker until they are of a\r\ndark brown or chocolate color.\r\n\r\n=Weevils' Food Supply:= The foliage, squares and bolls on cotton stalks\r\nconstitute the weevils' sole food supply. The Mexican cotton boll weevil\r\nnever feeds upon okra, peas, beans or other plants unless captured and\r\nplaced in confinement and then only to a slight extent.\r\n\r\n=Rate of Increase:= The weevils that survive the winter begin to lay eggs\r\nwhen the first squares form on the cotton and successive broods continue\r\nto lay eggs until checked by heavy or killing frost in the late fall.\r\nObservations made by Drs. W. D. Hunter and W. E. Hinds, show that the\r\nfemale weevil deposits eggs at the rate of from three to five per day and\r\ncontinues to lay eggs for an average of twenty-eight days. The following\r\nis a quotation from Dr. W. D. Hunter, government entomologist in charge\r\nof the boll weevil work in the South: \"A conservative estimate of the\r\npossible progeny of a single pair of weevils during the season beginning\r\non June 20 and extending to November 4 is 12,755,000.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Larvae of boll weevil in cotton square]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Life Period of Weevil:= Weevils born during the early summer live from\r\nfifty to seventy-five days. Weevils that are born late in the fall\r\nhibernate and large numbers live through the winter and for about twenty\r\ndays after emerging in the spring.\r\n\r\n=Hibernation:= The immature weevils in the squares and bolls are usually\r\nkilled during the winter. All adult weevils become dormant and the well\r\nprotected weevils usually live through the winter and do great damage in\r\nthe spring. The adult weevil spends the winter in hedges, broomsedge,\r\nwoods, hay stacks, farm buildings, decayed logs, moss and dead trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRotation of Crops\r\n\r\n\r\nA Safe and Sane System of Crop Rotation in Boll Weevil Territory\r\nAbsolutely Necessary\r\n\r\nWhen the boll weevil first appears in a territory, the first efforts at\r\nbreaking away from all cotton usually consist in going largely into\r\nanother single crop system of farming rather than the production of a\r\nvariety of crops. The evils of the new system are usually as great as\r\nthose of the all cotton system. Many farmers rush into the truck business.\r\nOf course, truck crops should be grown on every farm in the weevil\r\nterritory, and, in some particular localities, they may constitute the\r\nmain reliance for cash, but it seems that the truck business is a gamble\r\nfor the average cotton farmer. Trucking has lured many a farmer to\r\nfinancial ruin.\r\n\r\nThe crop rotation for the average cotton farmer should include oats, corn,\r\nsome cotton, and at least one leguminous crop. Along with this should go\r\nthe growing of hogs, mules, horses and cattle instead of having to buy\r\nthem from other sections of the country.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible for the farmer in the boll weevil territory to entirely\r\nsupplant cotton as a money crop, but this crop should be supplemented with\r\nthe growing of home supplies, as well as other crops which will produce\r\ncash returns.\r\n\r\nCotton is one of the greatest cash crops, and while it should be the main\r\nmoney crop in the boll weevil territory north of latitude 32, it should\r\nnot be the only cash crop grown. The safest plan either within or without\r\nthe boll weevil territory is to follow a system of diversified farming.\r\nThe cotton farmers, especially those in the boll weevil territory, cannot\r\nafford to depend entirely on cotton as a cash crop. A system of rotation\r\nsuitable for cotton belt farmers should include some of the following\r\nstaple crops:\r\n\r\n_Oats are probably_ the surest and best paying small grain crop that can\r\nbe grown over practically the entire cotton belt. The same soil that will\r\nproduce one bale of cotton per acre will grow 60 bushels of oats. At the\r\naverage price that has prevailed for oats during the past five years, the\r\n60 bushels will sell for $36 to $40, and the straw, when baled, will often\r\npay the larger part of the expense of growing the grain.\r\n\r\n_The bale of cotton per acre land_ will produce about $30 worth of oats,\r\nat least one and a half tons of lespedeza hay, and five bushels of\r\nlespedeza seed. The lespedeza hay will sell for about $12 per ton and the\r\nlespedeza seed for about $3 per bushel. The total is $63 per acre. We are\r\npersonally acquainted with a farmer who has averaged $65 per acre for\r\neight years.\r\n\r\n_Thirty dollars worth of oats_ and twenty bushels of soy beans at $1.50\r\nper bushel, and one and a half tons of soy bean hay at $8 per ton, means\r\n$72 per acre. These are very conservative figures. At the Mississippi\r\nDelta Experiment Station in 1912 the land produced ninety bushels of oats\r\nto the acre, twenty-two and a half bushels of soy beans, \"after losing a\r\ngood percentage of the beans by shattering,\" and 5,200 pounds of soy bean\r\nhay. The average yield of cotton on the same land was about 500 pounds of\r\nlint per acre.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Oats in a three-year rotation with cotton and corn]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Oats and vetch_ sown together furnish more and better grazing and better\r\nhay than either when sown separately. There is no better hay than oats and\r\nvetch cut in the dough stage. Few hays will sell for a better price on the\r\nmarket. The oat and vetch hay provides a much more satisfactory ration for\r\nhorses and mules than corn or leguminous hay.\r\n\r\n_Oats may be followed by cowpeas._ When the cowpeas are planted in rows on\r\ngood land, well fertilized and cultivated, the yield is usually from ten\r\nto twenty bushels of peas and one and a half tons of hay. The peas usually\r\nsell for about $2 per bushel and the hay for about $12 per ton.\r\n\r\n_Ninety bushels of oats_ and sixty-seven bushels of peanuts were produced\r\non the same land at the Mississippi Delta Experiment Station in one year.\r\nAt the present prices for peanuts and peanut hay, it is a very profitable\r\ncrop to grow after oats when properly handled.\r\n\r\n_When corn is planted_ on fertile soil thoroughly prepared, _properly\r\nfertilized_ and cultivated, the yield is usually about fifty bushels per\r\nacre. The average price per bushel is about 80 cents. Peas planted in corn\r\nat the last working will usually average about eight bushels of peas and a\r\nton or more of valuable hay. The peavine hay can be harvested by live\r\nstock.\r\n\r\n_The growing of live stock_ will help to create extensive home markets for\r\nroughage and leguminous crops, keep the money at home that is usually sent\r\nto the north and west for pork products, mules, horses, hay, beef, and so\r\non, and at the same time add greatly to the fertility of the soil. Pork\r\ncan be produced in the cotton belt more easily than any other live stock.\r\nIt would not be wise for the average cotton farmer to devote his farm\r\nexclusively to hog raising, yet it will certainly pay him to produce\r\nenough pork for home use and some to sell to supplement the money formerly\r\nobtained for cotton.\r\n\r\nChickens, turkeys, ducks and other poultry sell for good prices and every\r\ncotton farmer in the weevil territory should raise some poultry for sale.\r\n\r\nThe Labor Problem\r\n\r\nPlenty of good labor is an absolute necessity in growing cotton under boll\r\nweevil conditions. The tendency of newly infested districts is to neglect\r\nthe laborer at the time when he needs support and encouragement. Thousands\r\nof families have moved out of a single county in one season to other\r\ncotton sections, while if they had been given a little encouragement to\r\ngrow corn, grain, cowpeas, hogs, vegetables in his own garden, etc., he\r\nwould have remained in the community where he is much needed.\r\n\r\nThe farmers, planters, merchants and bankers must unite and see to it that\r\nthe laborers have the actual necessities of life. He should be encouraged\r\nto grow his home supplies, a little cotton, a few chickens and his own\r\npork. This method would put farming on a basis which will eliminate and do\r\naway with the necessity of sending to the north and west for bacon, lard,\r\nmules, corn, hay and other supplies. By working together and keeping our\r\nlaborers satisfied we will keep them in the community where they are\r\nneeded to till the soil and help build up our farms.\r\n\r\nThe Debt Problem\r\n\r\nWhen traveling in weevil territory, we meet farmers almost daily who are\r\nanxious to sell their farms at from one-third to one-fifth of their real\r\nvalue. The farmers tell us that they are in debt and will never be able to\r\npay out. They say that the boll weevil has come to destroy their\r\ncotton--their sole cash crop.\r\n\r\nNow these farmers are mistaken on two counts. First, cotton is not the\r\nonly surplus money crop; second, the boll weevil does not prevent the\r\ngrowing of profitable crops of cotton in normal seasons. The cotton money\r\nis now used to pay for corn, bacon, lard, mules and hay. When the tenants\r\nand farmers all live at home and practice the most rigid economy, the\r\ncotton money will soon pay all debts.\r\n\r\nLife on the farm is robbed of practically all of its pleasures as long as\r\nwe pay fifty per cent credit profits and the creditor constantly knocks at\r\nthe door. The only people who really suffer in periods of hard times are\r\nthe men who are in debt; men who owe money and are often compelled to\r\nsacrifice their property to meet the imperative demands of their\r\ncreditors. The farmer who is out of debt when the boll weevil comes and\r\nhas an abundance of high class food supplies on his farm is not materially\r\naffected. Many of the cotton farmers who are in debt when the boll weevil\r\ncomes lose their homes.\r\n\r\nLabor Saving Implements\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from an address delivered at Greenville,\r\nMiss., in the boll weevil territory, by Dr. S. A. Knapp, a man who did\r\nmore for real genuine progress in the South than any other one man has\r\never done. \"The farmer who uses modern machinery in planting and\r\ncultivating his crop will succeed, and the one who does not will make a\r\nfailure. The old way of making a crop by hand by the use of the hoe and\r\nplow must soon be a thing of the past. We must come to use the modern\r\nimplements and the sooner we let the negro understand that he must work\r\nhis crop in this way, the better off we shall be.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boll weevils attacking growing cotton boll]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Personal Element in the Boll Weevil Fight\r\n\r\nBy B. L. Moss\r\n\r\nEditor Progressive Farmer, Birmingham, Alabama.\r\n\r\nA man's personal attitude and convictions play a large part in his\r\nsuccesses and failures in all walks of life, and nowhere is the truth more\r\napparent than in a farmer's attitude toward the boll weevil problem.\r\n\r\nBefore the coming of the weevil, it is looked upon by nine farmers out of\r\nten as a remote danger, doubtful in time of arrival and greatly\r\nexaggerated in its possibilities for damage. No preparations for it are\r\nmade, the farm mortgage is left hanging like a cloud over the family\r\nhomestead, and the old methods so long in vogue are left unchanged.\r\n\r\nThen the crash comes! The obsolete methods of the past are worthless\r\nagainst the weevil; the cotton crop is swept away, interest on the\r\nmortgage is unpaid, and its foreclosure is certain. This picture is the\r\nrule and not the exception.\r\n\r\nSuch a situation calls forth the real qualities of the man. Many a farmer,\r\nfor the first few years of the weevil invasion, has proven a quitter. He\r\nhas failed because he did not think he could succeed. Usually he has been\r\nthe identical man who failed to believe in and prepare for the coming of\r\nthe weevil.\r\n\r\nThe exceptional man has believed in and prepared for the weevil's coming,\r\nand he has succeeded. Incidentally, his success has shown out as a beacon\r\nlight to his doubting neighbors and has ultimately pointed the way for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFive years' experience tells me that you can raise cotton profitably in\r\nthe presence of the boll weevil. The HOW of the matter is given by others\r\nin this booklet, but you, YOU, must take it up with the spirit of FIGHT.\r\nBelieve that you can, swear that you will, and success is yours.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lespedeza a great hay crop for the lower South]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Boll Weevil's Influence in the Regeneration of the South\r\n\r\nBy H. Guy Hathorn, Planter, Woodville, Miss.\r\n\r\nFor many years the one crop system has been the bane of the cotton belt.\r\nWhen land was virgin, cheap and plentiful, the evil was not so apparent,\r\nand the necessity for a saner system was not so pressing. A depleted soil,\r\nunreliable labor and various other factors caused certain individuals to\r\nsee the error of their way, and induced them to adopt a diversified system\r\nand the use of labor-saving implements. It was necessary for the great\r\nmajority to receive a paralyzing shock before they would make any material\r\nchange; that shock came in the shape of the boll weevil. As certain\r\nalternative medicines create great debility and languor of the body before\r\nthe curative power can become operative, so has all business in any way\r\nconnected with the growing of cotton suffered depression as a preliminary\r\nto the greater financial vigor and strength that comes after a few years'\r\nexperience with stock raising and diversification as the rule, and with\r\ncotton occupying a secondary place in the farm operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter from the Late Dr. S. A. Knapp to G. H. Alford\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course the heavy rains have been favorable to the weevil, and nothing\r\nelse could have been expected in weevil territory than the weevil should\r\nappear and be rather plentiful on the young cotton. But our experience in\r\nthis boll weevil fight is that it is far better to have a wet period at\r\nthis time than later, when the plant is much larger and the squares more\r\nnumerous. The farmer is inclined to look at the dark side of things. This\r\nearly rain is rather a favorable symptom than otherwise because, in all\r\nprobability, it will clear off and be warm and dry. In 1907 we had just\r\nsuch a period of rain a trifle later than this. It cleared off and in a\r\nfew weeks nine-tenths of the weevil, so far as reported, had disappeared.\r\nThe man who energetically clears out his cotton as soon as the weather\r\npermits and strictly follows our plan of intensive cultivation, will be\r\nquite sure to make a fair crop.\r\n\r\nWe are not afraid of these early rains; it is the late rain, because if\r\nthe planter now follows our plan and picks up the squares for a month, the\r\nweevils will be pretty nearly exterminated. In fact, if everybody would do\r\nit the weevil would do very little damage. But when there is a period of\r\ncontinuous rain after the plant has nearly matured, it is a much more\r\ndifficult problem to handle. The sun has less access to the plant and it\r\nis more difficult to secure all the fallen squares.\r\n\r\nThe greatest problem with which we have had to deal in boll weevil\r\nterritory is the hopeless view of the farmer. He wants to plow up his\r\ncotton and put in something else, or he refuses to give his cotton the\r\nattention which it requires. If he follows our plan thoroughly he will\r\nsucceed, and in future will make his crop hopefully as he did before the\r\nboll weevil appeared.\r\n\r\n\r\nPicking Weevils and Squares\r\n\r\nThe following is the substance of a number of letters from Mississippi\r\nfarmers relative to picking weevils and squares: Mr. T. L. Rush says that\r\nthe first time he caught an average of fifty weevils per acre and the\r\nsecond time twenty-eight. The cost of picking the weevils was about fifty\r\ncents per acre. He gathered the punctured squares seven times at a cost of\r\nabout $2.50 per acre. Mr. C. S. Rowland picked the weevils and squares on\r\nthirty-five acres of cotton at a cost of $43.60. Mr. J. W. Shelton picked\r\nan average of sixty-five weevils per acre off his little cotton for four\r\nweeks at a cost of 25 cents per hundred. Mr. J. M. Crawford found 268\r\nweevils the first time; two hundred and fifty the second time, one hundred\r\nand ninety-seven the third time and one hundred and fifty the fourth time.\r\nHe gathered one bushel of squares the first time and three bushels a\r\nsecond time. The cost was about $20.00 on the ten acres. Mr. A. W. Harrell\r\npicked over two acres of cotton three times and got one hundred and fifty\r\nweevils and seven hundred squares. It cost him about $2.00 per acre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProfitable Farming in South\r\n\r\n\r\nG. H. Alford, one of the agents of the government representing the\r\nagricultural department, talked to business men and planters at the\r\nVicksburg Cotton Exchange last week and said some good things, among them\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n\"The planters who keep their laborers and force them to grow plenty of\r\ncorn, rice, potatoes, molasses, hogs and poultry for home use and to\r\ncultivate say six or seven acres of cotton, according to government\r\ninstructions, will grow more prosperous every year. They will not grow as\r\nmuch cotton, but it will not be necessary for them to send two-thirds of\r\nthe money obtained for cotton to other sections of the country to pay for\r\nfarm products. Boll weevil or no weevil, prosperity will be the rule in\r\nWarren county when all of her people live on the products of the farms and\r\ngrow cotton as a surplus crop. I meet planters every day who are anxious\r\nto sell their plantations. They tell me they are in debt and will never be\r\nable to raise the mortgage. They say that the boll weevil is here to\r\ndestroy cotton--their money crop. They are mistaken on two counts.\r\nProfitable crops of cotton can be grown in spite of the boll weevil and\r\ncotton is not now a surplus money crop. They will grow profitable crops of\r\ncotton as a surplus crop in a year or so. They will then all live at home\r\nand grow say two-thirds as much cotton. The cotton money will then raise\r\nthe mortgages instead of paying for corn, bacon, lard, mules, hay, etc.\r\nThe boll weevil means diversified farming and stock raising. This means\r\nfertile soil and good farming. Fertile soil and good farming means high\r\npriced land. The boll weevil will probably keep the price of land down for\r\ntwo or three years, but diversified agriculture and the raising of good\r\nhogs, cattle, mules, horses and other stock will force the price up and up\r\nuntil it will sell for four or five times its present market value. Let\r\nevery planter hold a tight grip on his land. There is no excuse for the\r\nblues. The northern farmers are getting rich. They cannot grow cotton.\r\nThey cannot grow sugar cane, rice and many other crops that can be grown\r\nin Warren. Any crop will grow here that the northerners can grow.\r\nDiversified farming and stock raising and the growing of cotton as a\r\nsurplus crop will put Warren county on the high road to genuine\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pigs idea of heaven]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Very Instructive Letter\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter from C. R. Byrnes, Natchez, Miss., to G. H. Alford: \"We are just\r\nclosing our second year of serious disaster from this little pest. We show\r\na decided improvement in 1910 over the year of 1909. Our acreage is about\r\none-half of what it was last year and we will make about the same crop as\r\nlast year. In my individual case, I made last year seventeen bales on 150\r\nacres; this year I will make the same crop on eighty acres. You are aware\r\nthat I do not live on my own farm and have only negro tenants. I have\r\ndirected the management by not exceeding two visits to the farm each week\r\nduring the working season and have followed the government's directions as\r\nwell as I could, situated as I am. If I had lived on my farm far better\r\nresults could have been obtained. I have now more corn than I will require\r\nfor next year's crop and a good start of hogs and cattle. My farm has been\r\nmore than self-sustaining this year and I believe I will have a splendid\r\nreturn next year, as I have so little to buy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A tractor turning four furrows]\r\n\r\n\r\nMy success is due to the aid of Government instructions. To illustrate:\r\nOne of my negro tenants, when I told him in the month of May that he must\r\nsend his entire family into his cotton patch and pick every punctured\r\nsquare from the cotton stalks and burn them and also kill the weevils to\r\nbe found, objected; said he did not believe in it. I replied that the\r\ninstructions were not original with me, that they were from the United\r\nStates Government, after a fifteen years' study of the boll weevil, and if\r\nhe thought he knew more about it than the Government I would try to place\r\nhim in the employ of the Government and get one of their men to come and\r\nwork his crop under his, the tenant's, direction. This remark had the\r\ndesired effect. He got the weevils and will make three bales of cotton on\r\neight acres, while he made only one and one-half bales on sixteen acres\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\nBeing a member of our Board of Supervisors, I insisted that our President,\r\nmanager of the convict farm, plant five acres in cotton and work it under\r\nGovernment's instructions. He was opposed to planting any cotton. I\r\ninsisted on it, stating that I was not after the money it would bring, but\r\nwanted it as an experiment and aid to our farmers, knowing that the labor\r\nwas there under absolute control, and that there would be no reason why it\r\ncould not be properly farmed. The five acres were planted and properly\r\nworked--two heavy bales have been ginned and another light bale will be\r\npicked. Now this was on thin upland, fertilized and worked as you would\r\nhave directed. Splendid results, is it not?\r\n\r\nYou are aware that this year and last year gave us too much rain in our\r\nsection to successfully combat the weevil, but we have doubled the yield\r\nunder similar conditions for each year and this increase is certainly due\r\nto the good work done by the Government in our behalf. Many more farmers\r\nwill next year follow more closely your instructions and if we can get a\r\nnormal season as to rainfall, the cotton crop will, in my opinion, show\r\nmuch more decidedly the value of the Government's work.\r\n\r\nNo doubt but this pest will spread until it covers the entire cotton belt\r\nof the south. I can see work for you all the way to the Atlantic\r\nSeaboard--work in front of you and work behind you. Have you ever thought\r\nwhat a barren waste there might have been in the wake of this little giant\r\nwere it not for the valuable assistance rendered by our Government? As it\r\nis we cover up his tracks almost as fast as they are made. Stand by us\r\nuntil we are able to stand alone. Then you and all connected with you in\r\nthis good work will forever have the heart-felt thanks of all the farmers\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The modern method of preparing the soil]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoll Weevil Literature\r\n\r\n\r\nU.
