Clowes & Sons, Ltd., Stamford\r\nStreet and Charing Cross\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo apologies are needed for a new edition of so favourite an author as\r\nPlutarch. From the period of the revival of classical literature in\r\nEurope down to our own times, his writings have done more than those of\r\nany other single author to familiarise us with the greatest men and the\r\ngreatest events of the ancient world.\r\n\r\nThe great Duke of Marlborough, it is said, confessed that his only\r\nknowledge of English history was derived from Shakespeare's historical\r\nplays, and it would not be too much to say that a very large proportion\r\nof educated men, in our own as well as in Marlborough's times, have owed\r\nmuch of their knowledge of classical antiquity to the study of\r\nPlutarch's Lives. Other writers may be read with profit, with\r\nadmiration, and with interest; but few, like Plutarch, can gossip\r\npleasantly while instructing solidly; can breathe life into the dry\r\nskeleton of history, and show that the life of a Greek or Roman worthy,\r\nwhen rightly dealt with, can prove as entertaining as a modern novel. No\r\none is so well able as Plutarch to dispel the doubt which all schoolboys\r\nfeel as to whether the names about which they read ever belonged to men\r\nwho were really alive; his characters are so intensely human and\r\nlifelike in their faults and failings as well as in their virtues, that\r\nwe begin to think of them as of people whom we have ourselves personally\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nHis biographies are numerous and short. By this, he avoids one of the\r\ngreatest faults of modern biographers, that namely of identifying\r\nhimself with some one particular personage, and endeavouring to prove\r\nthat all his actions were equally laudable. Light and shade are as\r\nnecessary to a character as to a picture, but a man who devotes his\r\nenergies for years to the study of any single person's life, is\r\ninsensibly led into palliating or explaining away his faults and\r\nexaggerating his excellencies until at last he represents him as an\r\nimpossible monster of virtue. Another advantage which we obtain by his\r\nmethod is that we are not given a complete chronicle of each person's\r\nlife, but only of the remarkable events in it, and such incidents as\r\nwill enable us to judge of his character. This also avoids what is the\r\ndreariest part of all modern biographies, those chapters I mean which\r\ndescribe the slow decay of their hero's powers, his last illness, and\r\nfinally his death. This subject, which so many writers of our own time\r\nseem to linger lovingly upon, is dismissed by Plutarch in a few lines,\r\nunless any circumstance of note attended the death of the person\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nWithout denying that Plutarch is often inaccurate and often diffuse;\r\nthat his anecdotes are sometimes absurd, and his metaphysical\r\nspeculations not unfrequently ridiculous, he is nevertheless generally\r\nadmitted to be one of the most readable authors of antiquity, while all\r\nagree that his morality is of the purest and loftiest type.\r\n\r\nThe first edition of the Greek text of Plutarch's Lives appeared at\r\nFlorence in the year 1517, and two years afterwards it was republished\r\nby Aldus. Before this, however, about the year 1470, a magnificent Latin\r\nversion by various hands appeared at Rome. From this, from the Greek\r\ntext, and also from certain MSS. to which he had access, Amyot in the\r\nyear 1559 composed his excellent translation, of which it has been well\r\nsaid: \"Quoique en vieux Gaulois, elle a un air de fraicheur qui la fait\r\nrejeunir de jour en jour.\"\r\n\r\nAmyot's spirited French version was no less spiritedly translated by Sir\r\nThomas North. His translation was much read and admired in its day; a\r\nmodern reviewer even goes so far as to say that it is \"still beyond\r\ncomparison the best version of Parallel Lives which the English tongue\r\naffords.\" Be this as it may, the world will ever be deeply indebted to\r\nNorth's translation, for it is to Shakespeare's perusal of that work\r\nthat we owe 'Coriolanus,' 'Antony and Cleopatra,' and 'Julius Caesar.'\r\n\r\nNorth's translation was followed by that known as Dryden's. This work,\r\nperformed by many different hands, is of unequal merit. Some Lives are\r\nrendered into a racy and idiomatic, although somewhat archaic English,\r\nwhile others fall far short of the standard of Sir Thomas North's work.\r\nDryden's version has during the last few years been re-edited by A.H.\r\nClough, Fellow of Oriel College, Oxford.\r\n\r\nThe translation by which Plutarch is best known at the present day is\r\nthat of the Langhornes. Their style is certainly dull and commonplace,\r\nand is in many instances deserving of the harsh epithets which have been\r\nlavished upon it. We must remember, however, before unsparingly\r\ncondemning their translation, that the taste of the age for which they\r\nwrote differed materially from that of our own, and that people who\r\ncould read the 'Letters of Theodosius and Constantia' with interest,\r\nwould certainly prefer Plutarch in the translation of the Langhornes to\r\nthe simpler phrases of North's or Dryden's version. All events, comic or\r\ntragic, important or commonplace, are described with the same inflated\r\nmonotony which was mistaken by them for the dignity of History. Yet\r\ntheir work is in many cases far more correct as a translation, and the\r\nauthor's meaning is sometimes much more clearly expressed, than in\r\nDryden's earlier version. Langhorne's Plutarch was re-edited by\r\nArchdeacon Wrangham in the year 1819.\r\n\r\nIn 1844, thirteen Lives were translated by that eminent scholar the late\r\nMr. George Long; and it is by way of complement to these Lives that the\r\npresent version was undertaken with his consent and his approval.\r\n\r\nThose translated by Mr. Long were selected by him as illustrating a\r\nperiod of Roman history in which he was especially interested, and will\r\ntherefore be found to be more fully annotated than the others. It has\r\nseemed to me unnecessary to give information in the notes which can at\r\nthe present day be obtained in a more convenient form in Dr. Smith's\r\nClassical Dictionary and Dictionary of Antiquities, many of the articles\r\nin which are written by Mr. Long himself. The student of classical\r\nliterature will naturally prefer the exhaustive essays to be found in\r\nthese works to any notes appended to Plutarch's text, while to those who\r\nread merely \"for the story,\" the notes prove both troublesome and\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nIn deciding on the spelling of the Greek proper names, I have felt great\r\nhesitation. To make a Greek speak of Juno or Minerva seems as absurd as\r\nto make a Roman swear by Herakles or Ares. Yet both Greek and Roman\r\ndivinities are constantly mentioned. The only course that seemed to\r\navoid absolute absurdity appeared to me to be that which I have adopted,\r\nnamely to speak of the Greek divinities by their Greek, and the Latin\r\nones by their Latin names. In substituting a k for the more usual c, I\r\nhave followed the example of Grote, who in his History spells all Greek\r\nnames exactly as they are written, with the exception of those with\r\nwhich we are so familiar in their Latin form as to render this\r\npractically impossible; as for instance in the case of Cyprus or\r\nCorinth, or of a name like Thucydides, where a return to the Greek k\r\nwould be both pedantic and unmeaning.\r\n\r\nThe text, which I have followed throughout, is that of C. Sintenis,\r\nLeipsic, 1873.\r\n\r\nAUBREY STEWART.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE CIVIL WARS OF ROME.[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: It has been thought desirable to give here Mr. Long's\r\npreface to the lives published by him, under the title of \"Civil Wars of\r\nRome.\" The lives will be found in subsequent volumes.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the extant Lives of Plutarch there are thirteen Lives of Romans\r\nwhich belong to the most eventful period of Roman history. They are the\r\nlives of the brothers Tiberius and Caius Sempronius Gracchus, of Caius\r\nMarius, Lucius Cornelius Sulla, Quintus Sertorius, Marcus Licinius\r\nCrassus, Cneius Pompeius Magnus, Marcus Porcius Cato the Younger, Marcus\r\nTullius Cicero, Lucius Licinius Lucullus, Caius Julius Caesar, Marcus\r\nJunius Brutus, and Marcus Antonius. From the year of the death of\r\nTiberius Gracchus, B.C. 133, to the death of Marcus Antonius, B.C. 30, a\r\nperiod of about one hundred years, the Roman State was convulsed by\r\nrevolutions which grew out of the contest between the People and the\r\nNobility, or rather, out of the contests between the leaders of these\r\ntwo bodies. This period is the subject of Appian's History of the Civil\r\nWars of the Romans, in Five Books. Appian begins with the Tribunate and\r\nlegislation of Tiberius Gracchus, from which he proceeds to the\r\nDictatorship of Sulla, and then to the quarrels between Pompeius and\r\nCaesar, and Caesar's Dictatorship and assassination. He then proceeds to\r\nthe history of the Triumvirate formed after Caesar's death by his great\r\nnephew Caius Julius Caesar Octavianus, Marcus Antonius, and Lepidus, the\r\nquarrels of the Triumviri, the downfall of Lepidus, who was reduced to\r\nthe condition of a private person, and the death of Sextus Pompeius, the\r\nlast support of the party in whose cause his father, Cneius Pompeius,\r\nlost his life. The remainder of this History, which is lost, carried the\r\nnarration down to the quarrels of Octavianus and Marcus Antonius, which\r\nended in the defeat of Antonius in the battle of Actium, B.C. 31, and\r\nhis death in Egypt, B.C. 30. The victory over Antonius placed all the\r\npower in the hands of Octavianus, who, in the year B.C. 27, received\r\nfrom the Roman Senate the title of Augustus, or the Sacred, by which\r\nname he is commonly known as the first of the long series of Roman\r\nEmperors. \"He made himself,\" says Appian (_Civil Wars_, i. 5), \"like\r\nCaius Julius Caesar, and still more than Caesar, governor of his country\r\nand of all the nations under it, without needing either election or the\r\npopular votes, or any show of such things. After his government had\r\nsubsisted for a long time, and been maintained with vigour, fortunate in\r\nall his measures, and feared, he left behind him descendants and\r\nsuccessors who kept the power that he transmitted to them. In this way,\r\nafter various civil commotions, the Roman State was restored to\r\ntranquillity, and the government became a Monarchy. And how this came\r\nabout I have explained, and brought together all the events, which are\r\nwell worth the study of those who wish to become acquainted with\r\nambition of men unbounded, love of power excessive, endurance unwearied,\r\nand forms of suffering infinite.\" Thus, the historian's object was to\r\ntrace the establishment of the Imperial power in Rome back to its\r\norigin, to show that the contests of the rival heads of parties involved\r\nthe State in endless calamities, which resulted in a dissolution of all\r\nthe bonds that held society together, and rendered the assumption of\r\nsupreme power by one man a healing and a necessary event.\r\n\r\nAs already observed, it happens that thirteen of Plutarch's extant Lives\r\nare the lives of the most distinguished of the Romans who lived during\r\nthis eventful period; and though Plutarch's Lives severally are not\r\nhistories of the times to which they respectively refer, nor\r\ncollectively form a History of any given time, yet they are valuable as\r\nportraits of illustrious men, and help us to form a better judgment of\r\nthose who make so conspicuous a figure in History.\r\n\r\nPlutarch was a native of the town of Chaeroneia, in Boeotia; the times\r\nof his birth and death are not exactly known, but we learn from his own\r\nworks that he was a young student at Delphi, in the thirteenth year of\r\nthe reign of the Emperor Nero, A.D. 66. He visited both Italy and Rome,\r\nand probably resided at Rome for some time. He wrote his Life of\r\nDemosthenes, at least after his return to Chaeroneia: he says (_Life of\r\nDemosthenes_, c. 2), that he had not time to exercise himself in the\r\nLatin Language during his residence at Rome, being much occupied with\r\npublic business, and giving lessons in philosophy. Accordingly it was\r\nlate before he began to read the Latin writers; and we may infer from\r\nhis own words that he never acquired a very exact knowledge of the\r\nlanguage. He observes that it happened in his case, that in his study of\r\nthe Latin writers he did not so much learn and understand the facts from\r\nthe words, as acquire the meaning of the words from the facts, of which\r\nhe had already some knowledge. We may perhaps conclude from this, that\r\nPlutarch wrote all his Roman lives in Chaeroneia, after he had returned\r\nthere from Rome. The statement that Plutarch was the preceptor of the\r\nEmperor Trajan, and was raised to the consular rank by him, is not\r\nsupported by sufficient evidence. Plutarch addressed to Trajan his Book\r\nof Apophthegms, or Sayings of Kings and Commanders; but this is all that\r\nis satisfactorily ascertained as to the connection between the Emperor\r\nand Philosopher. Trajan died A.D. 117.\r\n\r\n\"The plan of Plutarch's Biographies is briefly explained by himself in\r\nthe introduction to the Life of Alexander the Great, where he makes an\r\napology for the brevity with which he is compelled to treat of the\r\nnumerous events in the Lives of Alexander and Caesar. 'For,' he says, 'I\r\ndo not write Histories, but Lives; nor do the most conspicuous acts of\r\nnecessity exhibit a man's virtue or his vice, but oftentimes some slight\r\ncircumstance, a word, or a jest, shows a man's character better than\r\nbattles with the slaughter of tens of thousands, and the greatest arrays\r\nof armies and sieges of cities. Now, as painters produce a likeness by a\r\nrepresentation of the countenance and the expression of the eyes,\r\nwithout troubling themselves about the other parts of the body, so I\r\nmust be allowed to look rather into the signs of a man's character, and\r\nthus give a portrait of his life, leaving others to describe great\r\nevents and battles.' The object then of Plutarch in his Biographies was\r\na moral end, and the exhibition of the principal events in a man's life\r\nwas subordinate to this his main design; and though he may not always\r\nhave adhered to the principle which he laid down, it cannot be denied\r\nthat his view of what biography should be, is much more exact than that\r\nof most persons who have attempted this style of composition. The life\r\nof a statesman or of a general, when written with a view of giving a\r\ncomplete history of all the public events in which he was engaged, is\r\nnot biography, but history. This extract from Plutarch will also in some\r\nmeasure be an apology for the want of historical order observable in\r\nmany of his Lives. Though altogether deficient in that critical sagacity\r\nwhich discerns truth from falsehood, and distinguishes the intricacies\r\nof confused and conflicting statements, Plutarch has preserved in his\r\nLives a vast number of facts which would otherwise have been unknown to\r\nus. He was a great reader, and must have had access to large libraries.\r\nIt is said that he quotes two hundred and fifty writers, a great part of\r\nwhose works are now entirely lost.\" (_Penny Cyclopaedia_, art.\r\n\"Plutarch,\" by the writer of this Preface.)\r\n\r\nThe lively portraitures of men drawn in Plutarch's Lives have made them\r\nfavourite reading in all ages. Whether Plutarch has succeeded in drawing\r\nthe portraits true, we cannot always determine, because the materials\r\nfor such a judgment are sometimes wanting. But when we can compare his\r\nLives with other extant authorities, we must admit, that though he is by\r\nno means free from error as to his facts, he has generally selected\r\nthose events in a man's life which most clearly show his temper, and\r\nthat on the whole, if we judge of a man by Plutarch's measure, we shall\r\nform a just estimate of him. He generally wrote without any\r\npredilections or any prejudices. He tells us of a man's good and bad\r\nacts, of his good and bad qualities; he makes no attempt to conceal the\r\none or the other; he both praises and blames as the occasion may arise;\r\nand the reader leaves off with a mixed opinion about Plutarch's Greeks\r\nand Romans, though the favourable or the unfavourable side always\r\npredominates. The benevolent disposition of Plutarch, and his noble and\r\nelevated character, have stamped themselves on all that he has written.\r\nA man cannot read these Lives without being the better for it: his\r\ndetestation of all that is mean and disingenuous will be increased; his\r\nadmiration of whatever is truthful and generous will be strengthened and\r\nexalted.\r\n\r\nThe translation of these Lives is difficult. Plutarch's text is\r\noccasionally corrupted; and where it is not corrupted, his meaning is\r\nsometimes obscure. Many of the sentences are long and ill-constructed;\r\nthe metaphors often extravagant; and the just connection of the parts is\r\nsometimes difficult to discover. Many single words which are or ought to\r\nbe pertinent in Plutarch, and which go towards a description of\r\ncharacter in general or of some particular act, can hardly be rendered\r\nby any English equivalent; and a translator often searches in vain for\r\nsomething which shall convey to the reader the exact notion of the\r\noriginal. Yet Plutarch's narrative is lively and animated; his anecdotes\r\nare appropriately introduced and well told; and if his taste is\r\nsometimes not the purest, which in his age we could not expect it to be,\r\nhe makes amends for this by the fulness and vigour of his expression. He\r\nis fond of poetical words, and they are often used with striking effect.\r\nHis moral reflections, which are numerous, have the merit of not being\r\nunmeaning and tiresome, because he is always in earnest and has got\r\nsomething to say, and does not deal in commonplaces. When the reflection\r\nis not very profound, it is at least true; and some of his remarks show\r\na deep insight into men's character.\r\n\r\nI have attempted to give Plutarch's meaning in plain language; to give\r\nall his meaning, and neither more nor less. If I have failed in any\r\ncase, it is because I could do no better. But, though I have not always\r\nsucceeded in expressing exactly what I conceive to be the meaning of the\r\noriginal, I have not intentionally added to it or detracted from it. It\r\nmay be that there are passages in which I have mistaken the original;\r\nand those who have made the experiment of rendering from one language\r\ninto another, know that this will sometimes happen even in an easy\r\npassage. A difficult passage attracts more than usual of a translator's\r\nattention, and if he fails there, it is either because the difficulty\r\ncannot be overcome, or because he cannot overcome it. Mere inadvertence\r\nor sleepiness may sometimes cause a translator to blunder, when he would\r\nnot have blundered if any friend had been by to keep him awake.\r\n\r\nThe best thing that a man can do to avoid these and other errors is to\r\ncompare his translation, when he has finished it, with some other. The\r\ntranslation which I have compared with mine is the German translation of\r\nKaltwasser, Magdeburg, 1799, which is generally correct. Kaltwasser in\r\nhis Preface speaks of the way in which he used the German translations\r\nof two of his predecessors, J. Christopher Kind, Leipzig, 1745-1754, and\r\nH. v. Schirach, 1776-1780, and some others. He says, \"These two\r\ntranslations, with the French translations above mentioned, I have duly\r\nused, for it is the duty of a translator to compare himself with his\r\npredecessors; but I lay my labour before the eyes of the public, without\r\nfearing that I shall be accused of copying or of close imitation. First\r\nof all, I carefully studied the text of my author and translated him as\r\nwell as I could: then, and not before, I compared the labour of my\r\npredecessors, and where I found a more suitable expression or a happier\r\nturn, I made use of it without hesitation. In this way, every fault,\r\nevery deviation of the old translators must be apparent; the most\r\nstriking of them I have remarked on in the notes, but I have more\r\nfrequently amended such things silently, as a comparison will show the\r\nreader.\" The translator has not compared his version with any English\r\nversion. The translation of North, which has great merit in point of\r\nexpression, is a version of Amyot's French version, from which, however,\r\nit differs in some passages, where it is decidedly wrong and Amyot's\r\nversion is right. Indeed, it is surprising to find how correct this old\r\nFrench translation generally is. The translation of 'Plutarch's Lives\r\nfrom the Greek by several hands,' was published at London in 1683-86. It\r\nwas dedicated by Dryden to James Butler, the first Duke of Ormond, in a\r\nfulsome panegyric. It is said that forty-one translators laboured at the\r\nwork. Dryden did not translate any of the Lives; but he wrote the Life\r\nof Plutarch which is prefixed to this translation. The advertisement\r\nprefixed to the translation passes under the name and character of the\r\nbookseller (Jacob Tonson), but, as Malone observes, it may from internal\r\nevidence be safely attributed to Dryden. The bookseller says, \"You have\r\nhere the first volume of Plutarch's Lives turned from the Greek into\r\nEnglish; and give me leave to say, the first attempt of doing it from\r\nthe _originals_.\" This is aimed at North's version, of which Dryden\r\nremarks in his Life of Plutarch: \"As that translation was only from the\r\nFrench, so it suffered this double disadvantage; first, that it was but\r\na copy of a copy, and that too but lamely taken from the Greek original;\r\nsecondly, that the English language was then unpolished, and far from\r\nthe perfection which it has since attained; so that the first version is\r\nnot only ungrammatical and ungraceful, but in many places almost\r\nunintelligible.\" There is another English version, by the Langhornes,\r\nwhich has often been reprinted; there is an edition of it with notes by\r\nWrangham. I have compared my translation carefully with the German of\r\nKaltwasser, and sometimes with the French of Amyot, and I have thus\r\navoided some errors into which I should have fallen. There are errors\r\nboth in the versions of Amyot and Kaltwasser which I have avoided; but I\r\nmay have fallen into others.\r\n\r\nThe translation of Kaltwasser contains some useful notes. Those which I\r\nhave added to this translation are intended to explain so much as needs\r\nexplanation to a person who is not much acquainted with Roman history\r\nand Roman usages; but they will also be useful to others. The notes of\r\nKaltwasser have often reminded me of the passages where some note would\r\nbe useful, and have occasionally furnished materials also. But as I have\r\nalways referred to the original authorities, I do not consider it\r\nnecessary to make more than this general acknowledgment. The notes added\r\nto this translation are all my own, and contain my own opinions and\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nThis translation has been made from the edition of C. Sintenis, Leipzig,\r\n1839, and I have compared the text of Sintenis with that of G.H.\r\nSchaefer, Leipzig, 1826, which has been severely criticized: this\r\nedition contains, however, some useful notes. I have very seldom made\r\nany remarks on the Greek text, as such kind of remark would not have\r\nsuited the plan and design of this version, which is not intended for\r\nverbal critics.\r\n\r\nI shall explain by two brief extracts what is my main design in this\r\nversion and in the notes, which must be my apology for not affecting a\r\nlearned commentary, and my excuse to those who shall not find here the\r\nkind of remarks that are suitable to a critical edition of an ancient\r\nauthor. I have had another object than to discuss the niceties of words\r\nand the forms of phrases, a labour which is well in its place, if it be\r\ndone well, but is not what needs to be done to such an author as\r\nPlutarch to render him useful. A man who was a great reader of Plutarch,\r\na just and solid thinker above the measure of his age, and not surpassed\r\nin his way by any writer in our own, Montaigne, observes in his 'Essay\r\nof the Education of Children'--\"Let him enquire into the manners,\r\nrevenues, and alliances of princes, things in themselves very pleasant\r\nto learn, and very useful to know. In this conversing with men, I mean,\r\nand principally those who only live in the records of history, he shall\r\nby reading those books, converse with those great and heroic souls of\r\nformer and better ages. 'Tis an idle and vain study, I confess, to those\r\nwho make it so, by doing it after a negligent manner, but to those who\r\ndo it with care and observation, 'tis a study of inestimable fruit and\r\nvalue; and the only one, as Plato reports, the Lacedaemonians reserved\r\nto themselves. What profit shall he not reap as to the business of men,\r\nby reading the Lives of Plutarch? But withal, let my governor remember\r\nto what end his instructions are principally directed, and that he do\r\nnot so much imprint in his pupil's memory the date of the ruin of\r\nCarthage, as the manners of Hannibal and Scipio; not so much where\r\nMarcellus died, as why it was unworthy of his duty that he died there.\r\nThat he do not teach him so much the narrative part, as the business of\r\nhistory. The reading of which, in my opinion, is a thing that of all\r\nothers we apply ourselves unto with the most differing and uncertain\r\nmeasures.\"[A] North, in his address to the Reader, says: \"The profit of\r\nstories, and the praise of the Author, are sufficiently declared by\r\nAmiot, in his Epistle to the Reader: so that I shall not need to make\r\nmany words thereof. And indeed if you will supply the defects of this\r\ntranslation, with your own diligence and good understanding: you shall\r\nnot need to trust him, you may prove yourselves, that there is no\r\nprophane study better than Plutarch. All other learning is private,\r\nfitter for Universities than Cities, fuller of contemplation than\r\nexperience, more commendable in students themselves, than profitable\r\nunto others. Whereas stories are fit for every place, reach to all\r\npersons, serve for all times, teach the living, revive the dead, so far\r\nexcelling all other books, as it is better to see learning in Noblemen's\r\nlives, than to read it in Philosophers' writings.\"\r\n\r\nGEORGE LONG.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Cotton's Translation.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF PLUTARCH                               xxiii\r\n\r\nLIFE OF THESEUS                                    1\r\n\r\nLIFE OF ROMULUS                                   30\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF THESEUS AND ROMULUS                 62\r\n\r\nLIFE OF LYKURGUS                                  67\r\n\r\nLIFE OF NUMA                                      99\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF NUMA WITH LYKURGUS                 124\r\n\r\nLIFE OF SOLON                                    130\r\n\r\nLIFE OF POPLICOLA                                161\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF SOLON AND POPLICOLA                181\r\n\r\nLIFE OF THEMISTOKLES                             185\r\n\r\nLIFE OF CAMILLUS                                 214\r\n\r\nLIFE OF PERIKLES                                 252\r\n\r\nLIFE OF FABIUS MAXIMUS                           288\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF PERIKLES AND FABIUS MAXIMIUS       315\r\n\r\nLIFE OF ALKIBIADES                               318\r\n\r\nLIFE OF CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS                 357\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON BETWEEN ALKIBIADES AND CORIOLANUS     390\r\n\r\nLIFE OF TIMOLEON                                 395\r\n\r\nLIFE OF AEMILIUS                                 428\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF PAULUS AEMILIUS AND TIMOLEON       461\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF PLUTARCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlutarch was born probably between A.D. 45 and A.D. 50, at the little\r\ntown of Chaeronea in Boeotia. His family appears to have been long\r\nestablished in this place, the scene of the final destruction of the\r\nliberties of Greece, when Philip defeated the Athenians and Boeotian\r\nforces there in 338 B.C. It was here also that Sulla defeated\r\nMithridates, and in the great civil wars of Rome we again hear, this\r\ntime from Plutarch himself, of the sufferings of the citizens of\r\nChaeronea. Nikarchus, Plutarch's great-grandfather, was, with all the\r\nother citizens, without any exception, ordered by a lieutenant of Marcus\r\nAntonius to transport a quantity of corn from Chaeronea to the coast\r\nopposite the island of Antikyra. They were compelled to carry the corn\r\non their shoulders, like slaves, and were threatened with the lash if\r\nthey were remiss. After they had performed one journey, and were\r\npreparing their burdens for a second, the welcome news arrived that\r\nMarcus Antonius had lost the battle of Actium, whereupon both the\r\nofficers and soldiers of his party stationed in Chaeronea at once fled\r\nfor their own safety, and the provisions thus collected were divided\r\namong the inhabitants of the city.\r\n\r\nWhen Plutarch was born, however, no such warlike scenes as these were to\r\nbe expected. Nothing more than the traditions of war remained on the\r\nshores of the Mediterranean. Occasionally some faint echo of strife\r\nwould make itself heard from the wild tribes on the Danube, or in the\r\nfar Syrian deserts, but over nearly all the world known to the ancients\r\nwas established the Pax Romana. Battles were indeed fought, and troops\r\nwere marched upon Rome, but this was merely to decide who was to be the\r\nnominal head of the vast system of the Empire, and what had once been\r\nindependent cities, countries, and nations submitted unhesitatingly to\r\nwhoever represented that irresistible power. It might be imagined that a\r\npolitical system which destroyed all national individuality, and\r\nrendered patriotism in its highest sense scarcely possible, would have\r\nreacted unfavourably on the literary character of the age. Yet nothing\r\nof the kind can be urged against the times which produced Epictetus, Dio\r\nChrysostom and Arrian; while at Rome, Pliny the Younger, Tacitus,\r\nMartial, and Juvenal were reviving the memories of the Augustan age.\r\n\r\nFrom several passages in Plutarch's writings we gather that he studied\r\nunder a master named Ammonius, at Athens. For instance, at the end of\r\nhis Life of Themistokles, he mentions a descendant of that great man who\r\nwas his fellow-student at the house of Ammonius the philosopher. Again,\r\nhe tells us that once Ammonius, observing at his afternoon lecture that\r\nsome of his class had indulged too freely in the pleasures of the table,\r\nordered his own son to be flogged, \"because,\" he said, \"the young\r\ngentleman cannot eat his dinner without pickles,\" casting his eye at the\r\nsame time upon the other offenders so as to make them sensible that the\r\nreproof applied to them also.\r\n\r\nBy way of completing his education he proceeded to visit Egypt. The\r\n\"wisdom of the Egyptians\" always seems to have had a fascination for the\r\nGreeks, and at this period Alexandria, with its famous library and its\r\nmemories of the Ptolemies, of Kallimachus and of Theokritus, was an\r\nimportant centre of Greek intellectual activity. Plutarch's treatise on\r\nIsis and Osiris is generally supposed to be a juvenile work suggested by\r\nhis Egyptian travels. In all the Graeco-Egyptian lore he certainly\r\nbecame well skilled, although we have no evidence as to how long he\r\nremained in Egypt. He makes mention indeed of a feast given in his\r\nhonour by some of his relatives on the occasion of his return home from\r\nAlexandria, but we can gather nothing from the passage as to his age at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nOne anecdote of his early life is as follows:--\"I remember,\" he says,\r\n\"that when I was still a young man, I was sent with another person on a\r\ndeputation to the Proconsul; my colleague, as it happened, was unable to\r\nproceed, and I saw the Proconsul and performed the commission alone.\r\nWhen I returned I was about to lay down my office and to give a public\r\naccount of how I had discharged it, when my father rose in the public\r\nassembly and enjoined me not to say _I_ went, but _we_ went, nor to say\r\nthat _I_ said, but _we_ said, throughout my story, giving my colleague\r\nhis share.\"\r\n\r\nThe most important event in the whole of Plutarch's pious and peaceful\r\nlife is undoubtedly his journey to Italy and to Rome; but here again we\r\nknow little more than that he knew but little Latin when he went\r\nthither, and was too busy when there to acquire much knowledge of that\r\ntongue. His occupation at Rome, besides antiquarian researches which\r\nwere afterwards worked up into his Roman Lives, was the delivery of\r\nlectures on philosophical and other subjects, a common practice among\r\nthe learned Greeks of his day. Many of these lectures, it is\r\nconjectured, were afterwards recast by him into the numerous short\r\ntreatises on various subjects now included under the general name of\r\nMoralia. Plutarch's visit to Rome and business there is admirably\r\nexplained in the following passage of North's 'Life of Plutarch':--\"For\r\nmy part, I think Plutarch was drawn to Rome by meanes of some friends he\r\nhad there, especially by Sossius Senecio, that had been a Consull, who\r\nwas of great estimation at that time, and namely under the Empire of\r\nTrajan. And that which maketh me think so, is because of Plutarch's own\r\nwords, who saith in the beginning of his first book of his discourse at\r\nthe table, that he gathered together all his reasons and discourses made\r\nhere and there, as well in Rome with Senecio, as in Greece with Plutarch\r\nand others. Not being likely that he would have taken the pains to have\r\nmade so long a voyage, and to have come to such a city where he\r\nunderstood not their vulgar tongue, if he had not been drawn thither by\r\nSenecio, and such other men; as also in acknowledgement of the good\r\nturnes and honour he had received by such men, he dedicated diverse of\r\nhis bookes unto them, and among others, the Lives unto Senecio, and the\r\nnine volumes of his discourse at the table, with the treaty, How a man\r\nmay know that he profiteth in vertue. Now for the time, considering what\r\nhe saith in the end of his book against curiosity, I suppose that he\r\ntaught in Rome in the time of Titus and of Domitian: for touching this\r\npoint, he maketh mention of a nobleman called Rusticus, who being one\r\nday at his lecture, would not open a letter which was brought him from\r\nthe Emperor, nor interrupt Plutarch, but attended to the end of his\r\ndeclamation, and until all the hearers were gone away; and addeth also,\r\nthat Rusticus was afterwards put to death by the commandment of\r\nDomitian. Furthermore, about the beginning of the Life of Demosthenes,\r\nPlutarch saith, that whilst he remained in Italy and at Rome, he had no\r\nleizure to study the Latine tongue; as well for that he was busied at\r\nthat time with matters he had in hand, as also to satisfie those that\r\nwere his followers to learne philosophie of him.\"[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: North's 'Plutarch,' 1631, p. 1194.]\r\n\r\nA list of all Plutarch's writings would be a very long one. Besides the\r\nLives, which is the work on which his fame chiefly rests, he wrote a\r\nbook of 'Table Talk,' which may have suggested to Athenaeus the plan of\r\nhis 'Symposium.'\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable of his minor works is that 'On the Malignity of\r\nHerodotus.' Grote takes this treatise as being intended seriously as an\r\nattack upon the historian, and speaks of the \"honourable frankness which\r\nPlutarch calls his malignity.\" But it is probably merely a rhetorical\r\nexercise, in which Plutarch has endeavoured to see what could be said\r\nagainst so favourite and well-known a writer.\r\n\r\nHe was probably known as an author before he went to Rome. Large\r\ncapitals have always had a natural attraction for literary genius, as it\r\nis in them alone that it can hope to be appreciated. And if this be the\r\ncase at the present day, how much more must it have been so before the\r\ninvention of printing, at a time when it was more usual to listen to\r\nbooks read aloud than to read them oneself? Plutarch journeyed to Rome\r\njust as Herodotus went to Athens, or as he is said to have gone to the\r\nOlympian festival, in search of an intelligent audience of educated men.\r\nWhether his object was merely praise, or whether he was influenced by\r\nideas of gain, we cannot say. No doubt his lectures were not delivered\r\ngratis, and that they were well attended seems evident from Plutarch's\r\nown notices of them, and from the names which have been preserved of the\r\neminent men who used to frequent them. Moreover, strange though it may\r\nappear to us, the demand for books seems to have been very brisk even\r\nthough they were entirely written by hand.\r\n\r\nThe epigrams of Martial inform us of the existence of a class of slaves\r\nwhose occupation was copying books, and innumerable allusions in Horace,\r\nMartial, &c., to the Sosii and others prove that the trade of a\r\nbookseller at Rome was both extensive and profitable. Towards the end of\r\nthe Republic it became the fashion for Roman nobles to encourage\r\nliterature by forming a library, and this taste was given immense\r\nencouragement by Augustus, who established a public library in the\r\nTemple of Apollo on the Mount Palatine, in imitation of that previously\r\nfounded by Asinius Pollio. There were other libraries besides these, the\r\nmost famous of which was the Ulpian library, founded by Trajan, who\r\ncalled it so from his own name, Ulpius. Now Trajan was a contemporary of\r\nour author, and this act of his clearly proves that there must have been\r\nduring Plutarch's lifetime a considerable reading public, and consequent\r\ndemand for books at Rome.\r\n\r\nOf Plutarch's travels in Italy we know next to nothing. He mentions\r\nincidentally that he had seen the bust or statue of Marius at Ravenna,\r\nbut never gives us another hint of how far he explored the country about\r\nwhich he wrote so much. No doubt his ignorance of the Latin language\r\nmust not be taken as a literal statement, and probably means that he was\r\nnot skilled in it as a spoken tongue, for we can scarcely imagine that\r\nhe was without some acquaintance with it when he first went to Rome, and\r\nhe certainly afterwards became well read in the literature of Rome. In\r\nsome cases he has followed Livy's narrative with a closeness which\r\nproves that he must have been acquainted with that author either in the\r\noriginal or in a translation, and the latter alternative is, of the two,\r\nthe more improbable.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be now generally thought that his stay at Rome was a short\r\none. Clough, in his excellent Preface, says on this subject, \"The fault\r\nwhich runs through all the earlier biographies, from that of Rualdus\r\ndownwards, is the assumption, wholly untenable, that Plutarch passed\r\nmany years, as many perhaps as forty, at Rome. The entire character of\r\nhis life is of course altered by such an impression.\" He then goes on to\r\nsay that in consequence of this mistaken idea, it is not worth while for\r\nhim to quote Dryden's 'Life of Plutarch,' which was originally prefixed\r\nto the translations re-edited by himself. Yet I trust I may be excused\r\nif I again quote North's 'Life of Plutarch,' as the following passage\r\nseems to set vividly before us the quiet literary occupation of his\r\nlater days.\r\n\r\n\"For Plutarch, though he tarried a long while in Italy, and in Rome, yet\r\nthat tooke not away the remembrance of the sweet aire of Greece, and of\r\nthe little towne where he was borne; but being touched from time to time\r\nwith a sentence of an ancient poet, who saith that,\r\n\r\n    \"'In whatsoever countrey men are bred\r\n    (I know not by what sweetnesse of it led),\r\n    They nourish in their minds a glad desire,\r\n    Unto their native homes for to retire,'\r\n\r\n\"he resolved to go back into Greece againe, there to end the rest of his\r\ndaies in rest and honour among his citizens, of whom he was honourably\r\nwelcomed home. Some judge that he left Rome after the death of Trajan,\r\nbeing then of great yeares, to leade a more quiet life. So being then at\r\nrest, he earnestly took in hand that which he had long thought of\r\nbefore, to wit, the Lives, and tooke great pains with it until he had\r\nbrought his worke to perfection, as we have done at this present;\r\nalthough that some Lives, as those of Scipio African, of Metellus\r\nNumidicus, and some other are not to be found. Now himselfe confesseth\r\nin some place, that when he began this worke, at the first it was but to\r\nprofit others; but that afterwards it was to profit himselfe, looking\r\nupon those histories, as if he had looked in a glasse, and seeking to\r\nreform his life in some sort, and to forme it in the mould of the\r\nvertues of these great men; taking this fashion of searching their\r\nmanners, and writing the Lives of these noble men, to be a familiar\r\nhaunting and frequenting of them. Also he thought, [said he himselfe]\r\nthat he lodged these men one after another in his house, entering into\r\nconsideration of their qualities, and that which was great in either of\r\nthem, choosing and principally taking that which was to be noted, and\r\nmost worthy to be knowne in their sayings and deeds.\"[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: North's 'Plutarch,' 1631, p. 1198.]\r\n\r\nOf Plutarch in his domestic relations we gather much information from\r\nhis own writings. The name of his father has not been preserved, but it\r\nwas probably Nikarchus, from the common habit of Greek families to\r\nrepeat a name in alternate generations. His brothers Timon and Lamprias\r\nare frequently mentioned in his essays and dialogues, where Timon is\r\nspoken of in the most affectionate terms. Rualdus has ingeniously\r\nrecovered the name of his wife, Timoxena, from internal evidence\r\nafforded by his writings. A touching letter is still extant, addressed\r\nby Plutarch to his wife, bidding her not give way to excessive grief at\r\nthe death of their only daughter, who was named Timoxena after her\r\nmother. The number of his sons we cannot exactly state. Autobulus and\r\nPlutarch are especially spoken of as his sons, since the treatise on the\r\nTimaeus of Plato is dedicated to them, and the marriage of his son\r\nAutobulus is the occasion of one of the dinner-parties recorded in the\r\n'Table Talk.' Another person, one Soklarus, is spoken of in terms which\r\nseem to imply that he was Plutarch's son, but this is nowhere definitely\r\nstated. His treatise also on Marriage Questions, addressed to Eurydike\r\nand Pollianus, seems to speak of her as having been recently an inmate\r\nof his house, but without enabling us to form an opinion whether she was\r\nhis daughter or not. A modern writer well describes his maturer years by\r\nthe words: \"Plutarch was well born, well taught, well conditioned; a\r\nself-respecting amiable man, who knew how to better a good education by\r\ntravels, by devotion to affairs private and public; a master of ancient\r\nculture, he read books with a just criticism: eminently social, he was a\r\nking in his own house, surrounded himself with select friends, and knew\r\nthe high value of good conversation; and declares in a letter written to\r\nhis wife that 'he finds scarcely an erasure, as in a book well written,\r\nin the happiness of his life.'\"\r\n\r\nHe was an active member of the little community of Chaeronea, being\r\narchon of that town. Whether this dignity was annual or for life we do\r\nnot know, but it was probably the former, and very likely he served it\r\nmore than once. He speaks of his devotion to the duties of his office as\r\ncausing him to incur the ridicule of some of his fellow-citizens, when\r\nthey saw him engaged in the humblest duties. \"But,\" he says, in Clough's\r\nversion, \"the story told about Antisthenes comes to my assistance. When\r\nsome one expressed surprise at his carrying home some pickled fish from\r\nmarket in his own hands, _It is_, he answered, _for myself_. Conversely,\r\nwhen I am reproached with standing by and watching while tiles are\r\nmeasured out, and stone and mortar brought up, _This service_, I say,\r\n_is not for myself_, it is for my country.\"\r\n\r\nPlutarch was for many years a priest of Apollo at Delphi. The scene of\r\nsome of his 'Table Talk' is laid there, when he in his priestly capacity\r\ngives a dinner party in honour of the victor in the poetic contest at\r\nthe Pythian games. Probably this office was a source of considerable\r\nincome, and as the journey from Chaeronea to Delphi, across Mount\r\nParnassus, is a very short one, it interfered but little with his\r\nliterary and municipal business. In his essay on \"Whether an old man\r\nshould continue to take part in public life,\" he says, \"You know,\r\nEuphanes, that I have for many Pythiads (that is, periods of four years\r\nelapsing between the Pythian festivals), exercised the office of Priest\r\nof Apollo: yet I think you would not say to me,'Plutarch, you have\r\nsacrificed enough; you have led processions and dances enough; it is\r\ntime, now that you are old, to lay aside the garland from your head, and\r\nto retire as superannuated from the oracle.'\"\r\n\r\nThus respected and loved by all, Plutarch's old age passed peacefully\r\naway. \"Notwithstanding,\" as North says, \"that he was very old, yet he\r\nmade an end of the Lives.... Furthermore, Plutarch, having lived alwaies\r\nhonourably even to old age, he died quietly among his children and\r\nfriends in the city of Chaeronea, leaving his writings, an immortal\r\nsavour of his name, unto posterity. Besides the honour his citizens did\r\nhim, there was a statue set up for him by ordinance of the people of\r\nRome, in memory of his virtues. Now furthermore, though time hath\r\ndevoured some part of the writings of this great man, and minished some\r\nother: neverthelesse those which remaine, being a great number, have\r\nexcellent use to this day among us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLUTARCH'S LIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF THESEUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. As in books on geography, Sossius Senecio, the writers crowd the\r\ncountries of which they know nothing into the furthest margins of their\r\nmaps, and write upon them legends such as, \"In this direction lie\r\nwaterless deserts full of wild beasts;\" or, \"Unexplored morasses;\" or,\r\n\"Here it is as cold as Scythia;\" or, \"A frozen sea;\" so I, in my\r\nwritings on Parallel Lives, go through that period of time where history\r\nrests on the firm basis of facts, and may truly say, \"All beyond this is\r\nportentous and fabulous, inhabited by poets and mythologers, and there\r\nis nothing true or certain.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I had written the lives of Lykurgus the lawgiver and Numa the king,\r\nit appeared to me natural to go back to Romulus also, as I was engaged\r\non the history of times so close to his. So when I was reflecting, in\r\nthe words of Aeschylus,\r\n\r\n    \"Against this chieftain, who can best contend?\r\n    Whom shall I match in fight, what trusty friend?\"\r\n\r\nit occurred to me to compare the founder of the fair and famous city of\r\nAthens with him, and to contrast Theseus with the father of unconquered\r\nglorious Rome. Putting aside, then, the mythological element, let us\r\nexamine his story, and wherever it obstinately defies probability, and\r\ncannot be explained by natural agency, let us beg the indulgence of our\r\nreaders, who will kindly make allowance for tales of antiquity.\r\n\r\nII. Theseus appears to have several points of resemblance to Romulus.\r\nBoth were unacknowledged illegitimate children, and were reputed to\r\ndescend from the Gods.\r\n\r\n    \"Both warriors, well we all do know,\"\r\n\r\nand both were wise as well as powerful. The one founded Rome, while the\r\nother was the joint founder of Athens; and these are two of the most\r\nfamous of cities. Both carried off women by violence, and neither of\r\nthem escaped domestic misfortune and retribution, but towards the end of\r\ntheir lives both were at variance with their countrymen, if we may put\r\nany trust in the least extravagant writings upon the subject.\r\n\r\nIII. Theseus traced his descent on the father's side from Erechtheus and\r\nthe original Autochthones,[A] while on the mother's side he was\r\ndescended from Pelops. For Pelops surpassed all the other princes of the\r\nPeloponnesus in the number of his children as well as in wealth; and of\r\nthese he gave many of his daughters in marriage to the chief men of the\r\ncountry, and established many of his sons as rulers in various cities.\r\nOne of these, Pittheus, the grandfather of Theseus, founded Troezen,\r\nwhich is indeed but a little state, though he had a greater reputation\r\nthan any man of his time for eloquence and wisdom. The nature of this\r\nwisdom of his seems to have been much of the same kind as that which\r\nmade the reputation of Hesiod, in the collection of maxims known as the\r\n'Works and Days.' One of these maxims is indeed ascribed to Pittheus:\r\n\r\n     \"Let promised pay be truly paid to friends.\"\r\n\r\nAt any rate, this is what Aristotle the philosopher has recorded; and\r\nalso Euripides, when he speaks of Hippolytus as \"child of holy\r\nPittheus,\" shows the prevailing opinion about Pittheus. Now Aegeus\r\ndesired to have children, and the Oracle at Delphi is said to have given\r\nhim the well-known response, forbidding him to have intercourse with any\r\nwoman before he reached Athens, but not appearing to explain this\r\nclearly. Consequently, on his way home, he went to Troezen, and asked\r\nthe advice of Pittheus about the response of the God, which ran thus:\r\n\r\n    \"Great chief, the wine-skin's foot must closed remain,\r\n    Till thou to Athens art returned again.\"\r\n\r\nPittheus clearly perceived what the oracle must mean, and persuaded or\r\ncheated Aegeus into an intrigue with Aethra. Afterwards, when he\r\ndiscovered that he had conversed with the daughter of Pittheus, as he\r\nimagined that she might prove with child, he left behind him his sword\r\nand sandals hidden under a great stone, which had a hollow inside it\r\nexactly fitting them. This he told to Aethra alone, and charged her if a\r\nson of his should be born, and on growing to man's estate should be able\r\nto lift the stone and take from under it the deposit, that she should\r\nsend him at once with these things to himself, in all secrecy, and as\r\nfar as possible concealing his journey from observation. For he greatly\r\nfeared the sons of Pallas, who plotted against him, and despised him on\r\naccount of his childlessness, they themselves being fifty brothers, all\r\nthe sons of Pallas.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Autochthones was the name by which the original citizens of\r\nAthens called themselves, meaning that they were sprung from the soil\r\nitself, not immigrants from some other country.]\r\n\r\nIV. When Aethra's child was born, some writers say that he was at once\r\nnamed Theseus, from the tokens placed under the stone; others say that\r\nhe was afterwards so named at Athens, when Aegeus acknowledged him as\r\nhis son. He was brought up by his grandfather Pittheus, and had a master\r\nand tutor, Konnidas, to whom even to the present day, the Athenians\r\nsacrifice a ram on the day before the feast of Theseus, a mark of\r\nrespect which is much more justly due to him, than those which they pay\r\nto Silanion and Parrhasius, who have only made pictures and statues of\r\nTheseus.\r\n\r\nV. As it was at that period still the custom for those who were coming\r\nto man's estate to go to Delphi and offer to the god the first-fruits of\r\ntheir hair (which was then cut for the first time),[A] Theseus went to\r\nDelphi, and they say that a place there is even to this day named after\r\nhim. But he only cut the front part of his hair, as Homer tells us the\r\nAbantes did, and this fashion of cutting the hair was called Theseus's\r\nfashion because of him. The Abantes first began to cut their hair in\r\nthis manner, not having, as some say, been taught to do so by the\r\nArabians, nor yet from any wish to imitate the Mysians, but because they\r\nwere a warlike race, and met their foes in close combat, and studied\r\nabove all to come to a hand-to-hand fight with their enemy, as\r\nArchilochus bears witness in his verses:\r\n\r\n    \"They use no slings nor bows,\r\n      Euboea's martial lords,\r\n    But hand to hand they close\r\n      And conquer with their swords.\"\r\n\r\nSo they cut their hair short in front, that their enemies might not\r\ngrasp it. And they say that Alexander of Macedon for the same reason\r\nordered his generals to have the beards of the Macedonians shaved,\r\nbecause they were a convenient handle for the enemy to grasp.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The first cutting of the hair was always an occasion of\r\nsolemnity among the Greeks, the hair being dedicated to some god. The\r\nfirst instance of this is in Homer's Iliad, where Achilles speaks of\r\nhaving dedicated his hair to the river Spercheius. The Athenian youth\r\noffered their hair to Herakles. The Roman emperor Nero, in later times,\r\nimitated this custom.]\r\n\r\nVI. Now while he was yet a child, Aethra concealed the real parentage of\r\nTheseus, and a story was circulated by Pittheus that his father was\r\nPoseidon. For the people of Troezen have an especial reverence for\r\nPoseidon; he is their tutelar deity; to him they offer first-fruits of\r\ntheir harvest, and they stamp their money with the trident as their\r\nbadge. But when he was grown into a youth, and proved both strong in\r\nbody and of good sound sense, then Aethra led him to the stone, told him\r\nthe truth about his father, and bade him take the tokens from beneath it\r\nand sail to Athens with them. He easily lifted the stone, but determined\r\nnot to go to Athens by sea, though the voyage was a safe and easy one,\r\nand though his mother and his grandfather implored him to go that way.\r\nBy land it was a difficult matter to reach Athens, as the whole way was\r\ninfested with robbers and bandits. That time, it seems, produced men of\r\ngreat and unwearied strength and swiftness, who made no good use of\r\nthese powers, but treated all men with overbearing insolence, taking\r\nadvantage of their strength to overpower and slay all who fell into\r\ntheir hands, and disregarding justice and right and kindly feeling,\r\nwhich they said were only approved of by those who dared not do injury\r\nto others, or feared to be injured themselves, while men who could get\r\nthe upper hand by force might disregard them. Of these ruffians,\r\nHerakles in his wanderings cut off a good many, but others had escaped\r\nhim by concealing themselves, or had been contemptuously spared by him\r\non account of their insignificance. But Herakles had the misfortune to\r\nkill Iphitus, and thereupon sailed to Lydia and was for a long time a\r\nslave in that country under Omphale, which condition he had imposed upon\r\nhimself as a penance for the murder of his friend. During this period\r\nthe country of Lydia enjoyed peace and repose; but in Greece the old\r\nplague of brigandage broke out afresh, as there was now no one to put it\r\ndown. So that the journey overland to Athens from Peloponnesus was full\r\nof peril; and Pittheus, by relating to Theseus who each of these\r\nevildoers was, and how they treated strangers, tried to prevail upon him\r\nto go by sea. But it appears that Theseus had for a long time in his\r\nheart been excited by the renown of Herakles for courage: he thought\r\nmore of him than of any one else, and loved above all to listen to those\r\nwho talked of him, especially if they had seen and spoken to him. Now he\r\ncould no longer conceal that he was in the same condition as\r\nThemistokles in later times, when he said that the trophy of Miltiades\r\nwould not let him sleep. Just so did the admiration which Theseus\r\nconceived for Herakles make him dream by night of his great exploits,\r\nand by day determine to equal them by similar achievements of his own.\r\n\r\nVII. As it happened, they were connected, being second cousins; for\r\nAethra was the daughter of Pittheus, and Alkmena the daughter of\r\nLysidike, and Lysidike and Pittheus were brother and sister, being the\r\nchildren of Pelops and Hippodameia. So Theseus thought that it would be\r\na great and unbearable disgrace to him that his cousin should go\r\neverywhere and clear the sea and land of the brigands who infested them,\r\nand he should refuse to undertake the adventures that came in his way;\r\nthrowing discredit upon his reputed father by a pusillanimous flight by\r\nsea, and upon his real father by bringing him only the sandals and an\r\nunfleshed sword, and not proving his noble birth by the evidence of some\r\nbrave deed accomplished by him. In this spirit he set out on his\r\njourney, with the intention of doing wrong to no one, but of avenging\r\nhimself on any one who offered wrong to him.\r\n\r\nVIII. And first in Epidaurus he slew Periphetes, who used a club as his\r\nweapon, and on this account was called the club-bearer, because he laid\r\nhands upon him and forbade him to proceed farther on his way. The club\r\ntook his fancy, and he adopted it as a weapon, and always used it, just\r\nas Herakles used his lion's skin; for the skin was a proof of how huge a\r\nbeast the wearer had overcome, while the club, invincible in the hands\r\nof Theseus, had yet been worsted when used against him. At the Isthmus\r\nhe destroyed Sinis the Pine-bender by the very device by which he had\r\nslain so many people, and that too without having ever practised the\r\nart, proving that true valour is better than practice and training.\r\nSinis had a daughter, a tall and beautiful girl, named Perigoune. When\r\nher father fell she ran and hid herself. Theseus sought her everywhere,\r\nbut she fled into a place where wild asparagus grew thick, and with a\r\nsimple child-like faith besought the plants to conceal her, as if they\r\ncould understand her words, promising that if they did so she never\r\nwould destroy or burn them. However, when Theseus called to her,\r\npledging himself to take care of her and do her no hurt, she came out,\r\nand afterwards bore Theseus a son, named Melanippus. She afterwards was\r\ngiven by Theseus in marriage to Deïoneus, the son of Eurytus of\r\nOechalia. Ioxus, a son of Melanippus, and Theseus's grandchild, took\r\npart in Ornytus's settlement in Caria; and for this reason the\r\ndescendants of Ioxus have a family custom not to burn the asparagus\r\nplant, but to reverence and worship it.\r\n\r\nIX. Now the wild sow of Krommyon, whom they called Phaia, was no\r\nordinary beast, but a fierce creature and hard to conquer. This animal\r\nhe turned out of his way to destroy, that it might not be thought that\r\nhe performed his exploits of necessity. Besides, he said, a brave man\r\nneed only punish wicked men when they came in his way, but that in the\r\ncase of wild beasts he must himself seek them out and attack them. Some\r\nsay that Phaia was a murderous and licentious woman who carried on\r\nbrigandage at Krommyon, and was called a sow from her life and habits,\r\nand that Theseus put her to death.\r\n\r\nX. Before coming to Megara he slew Skeiron by flinging him down a\r\nprecipice into the sea, so the story runs, because he was a robber, but\r\nsome say that from arrogance he used to hold out his feet to strangers\r\nand bid them wash them, and that then he kicked the washers into the\r\nsea. But Megarian writers, in opposition to common tradition, and, as\r\nSimonides says, \"warring with all antiquity,\" say that Skeiron was not\r\nan arrogant brigand, but repressed brigandage, loved those who were good\r\nand just, and was related to them. For, they point out, Aeakus is\r\nthought to have been the most righteous of all the Greeks, and Kychreus\r\nof Salamis was worshipped as a god, and the virtue of Peleus and Telamon\r\nis known to all. Yet Skeiron was the son-in-law of Kychreus, and\r\nfather-in-law of Aeakus, and grandfather of Peleus and Telamon, who were\r\nboth of them sons of Endeis, the daughter of Skeiron and his wife\r\nChariklo. It is not then reasonable to suppose that these, the noblest\r\nmen of their time, would make alliances with a malefactor, and give and\r\nreceive from him what they prized most dearly. But they say that Theseus\r\nslew Skeiron, not when he first went to Athens, but that afterwards he\r\ntook the town of Eleusis which belonged to the Megarians, by dealing\r\ntreacherously with Diokles, who was the chief magistrate there, and that\r\non that occasion he killed Skeiron. This is what tradition says on both\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nXI. At Eleusis Theseus overcame Kerkyon of Arcadia in wrestling and\r\nkilled him, and after journeying a little farther he killed Damastes,\r\nwho was surnamed Prokroustes, by compelling him to fit his own body to\r\nhis bed, just as he used to fit the bodies of strangers to it. This he\r\ndid in imitation of Herakles; for he used to retort upon his aggressors\r\nthe same treatment which they intended for him. Thus Herakles offered up\r\nBusiris as a sacrifice, and overcame Antaeus in wrestling, and Kyknus in\r\nsingle combat, and killed Termerus by breaking his skull. This is, they\r\nsay, the origin of the proverb, \"A Termerian mischief,\" for Termerus, it\r\nseems, struck passers-by with his head, and so killed them. So also did\r\nTheseus sally forth and chastise evildoers, making them undergo the same\r\ncruelties which they practised on others, thus justly punishing them for\r\ntheir crimes in their own wicked fashion.\r\n\r\nXII. As he proceeded on his way, and reached the river Kephisus, men of\r\nthe Phytalid race were the first to meet and greet him. He demanded to\r\nbe purified from the guilt of bloodshed, and they purified him, made\r\npropitiatory offerings, and also entertained him in their houses, being\r\nthe first persons from whom he had received any kindness on his journey.\r\nIt is said to have been on the eighth day of the month Kronion, which is\r\nnow called Hekatombeion, that he came to his own city. On entering it he\r\nfound public affairs disturbed by factions, and the house of Aegeus in\r\ngreat disorder; for Medea, who had been banished from Corinth, was\r\nliving with Aegeus, and had engaged by her drugs to enable Aegeus to\r\nhave children. She was the first to discover who Theseus was, while\r\nAegeus, who was an old man, and feared every one because of the\r\ndisturbed state of society, did not recognise him. Consequently she\r\nadvised Aegeus to invite him to a feast, that she might poison him.\r\nTheseus accordingly came to Aegeus's table. He did not wish to be the\r\nfirst to tell his name, but, to give his father an opportunity of\r\nrecognising him, he drew his sword, as if he meant to cut some of the\r\nmeat with it, and showed it to Aegeus. Aegeus at once recognised it,\r\noverset the cup of poison, looked closely at his son and embraced him.\r\nHe then called a public meeting and made Theseus known as his son to the\r\ncitizens, with whom he was already very popular because of his bravery.\r\nIt is said that when the cup was overset the poison was spilt in the\r\nplace where now there is the enclosure in the Delphinium, for there\r\nAegeus dwelt; and the Hermes to the east of the temple there they call\r\nthe one who is \"at the door of Aegeus.\"\r\n\r\nXIII. But the sons of Pallas, who had previously to this expected that\r\nthey would inherit the kingdom on the death of Aegeus without issue, now\r\nthat Theseus was declared the heir, were much enraged, first that\r\nAegeus should be king, a man who was merely an adopted child of Pandion,\r\nand had no blood relationship to Erechtheus, and next that Theseus, a\r\nstranger and a foreigner, should inherit the kingdom. They consequently\r\ndeclared war. Dividing themselves into two bodies, the one proceeded to\r\nmarch openly upon the city from Sphettus, under the command of Pallas\r\ntheir father, while the other lay in ambush at Gargettus, in order that\r\nthey might fall upon their opponents on two sides at once. But there was\r\na herald among them named Leos, of the township of Agnus, who betrayed\r\nthe plans of the sons of Pallas to Theseus. He suddenly attacked those\r\nwho were in ambush, and killed them all, hearing which the other body\r\nunder Pallas dispersed. From this time forth they say that the township\r\nof Pallene has never intermarried with that of Agnus, and that it is not\r\ncustomary amongst them for heralds to begin a proclamation with the\r\nwords \"Acouete Leo,\" (Oyez) for they hate the name of Leo[A] because of\r\nthe treachery of that man.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The Greek word _leos_ signifies people.]\r\n\r\nXIV. Now Theseus, who wished for employment and also to make himself\r\npopular with the people, went to attack the bull of Marathon, who had\r\ncaused no little trouble to the inhabitants of Tetrapolis. He overcame\r\nthe beast, and drove it alive through the city for all men to see, and\r\nthen sacrificed it to Apollo of Delphi. Hekale, too, and the legend of\r\nher having entertained Theseus, does not seem altogether without\r\nfoundation in fact; for the people of the neighbouring townships used to\r\nassemble and perform what was called the Hekalesian sacrifice to Zeus\r\nHekalus, and they also used to honour Hekale, calling her by the\r\naffectionate diminutive Hekaline, because she also, when feasting\r\nTheseus, who was very young, embraced him in a motherly way, and used\r\nsuch like endearing diminutives. She also made a vow on Theseus's\r\nbehalf, when he was going forth to battle, that if he returned safe she\r\nwould sacrifice to Zeus; but as she died before he returned, she had the\r\nabove-mentioned honours instituted by command of Theseus, as a grateful\r\nreturn for her hospitality. This is the legend as told by Philochorus.\r\n\r\nXV. Shortly after this the ship from Crete arrived for the third time\r\nto collect the customary tribute. Most writers agree that the origin of\r\nthis was, that on the death of Androgeus, in Attica, which was ascribed\r\nto treachery, his father Minos went to war, and wrought much evil to the\r\ncountry, which at the same time was afflicted by scourges from Heaven\r\n(for the land did not bear fruit, and there was a great pestilence and\r\nthe rivers sank into the earth). So that as the oracle told the\r\nAthenians that, if they propitiated Minos and came to terms with him,\r\nthe anger of Heaven would cease and they should have a respite from\r\ntheir sufferings, they sent an embassy to Minos and prevailed on him to\r\nmake peace, on the condition that every nine years they should send him\r\na tribute of seven youths and seven maidens. The most tragic of the\r\nlegends states these poor children when they reached Crete were thrown\r\ninto the Labyrinth, and there either were devoured by the Minotaur or\r\nelse perished with hunger, being unable to find the way out. The\r\nMinotaur, as Euripides tells us, was\r\n\r\n    \"A form commingled, and a monstrous birth,\r\n    Half man, half bull, in twofold shape combined.\"\r\n\r\nXVI. Philochorus says that the Cretans do not recognise this story, but\r\nsay that the Labyrinth was merely a prison, like any other, from which\r\nescape was impossible, and that Minos instituted gymnastic games in\r\nhonour of Androgeus, in which the prizes for the victors were these\r\nchildren, who till then were kept in the Labyrinth. Also they say that\r\nthe victor in the first contest was a man of great power in the state, a\r\ngeneral of the name of Taurus, who was of harsh and savage temper, and\r\nill-treated the Athenian children. And Aristotle himself, in his\r\ntreatise on the constitution of the Bottiaeans, evidently does not\r\nbelieve that the children were put to death by Minos, but that they\r\nlived in Crete as slaves, until extreme old age; and that one day the\r\nCretans, in performance of an ancient vow, sent first-fruits of their\r\npopulation to Delphi. Among those who were thus sent were the\r\ndescendants of the Athenians, and, as they could not maintain themselves\r\nthere, they first passed over to Italy, and there settled near\r\nIapygium, and from thence again removed to Thrace, and took the name of\r\nBottiaeans. For this reason, the Bottiaean maidens when performing a\r\ncertain sacrifice sing \"Let us go to Athens.\" Thus it seems to be a\r\nterrible thing to incur the hatred of a city powerful in speech and\r\nsong; for on the Attic stage Minos is always vilified and traduced, and\r\nthough he was called \"Most Kingly\" by Hesiod, and \"Friend of Zeus\" by\r\nHomer, it gained him no credit, but the playwrights overwhelmed him with\r\nabuse, styling him cruel and violent. And yet Minos is said to have been\r\na king and a lawgiver, and Rhadamanthus to have been a judge under him,\r\ncarrying out his decrees.\r\n\r\nXVII. So when the time of the third payment of the tribute arrived, and\r\nthose fathers who had sons not yet grown up had to submit to draw lots,\r\nthe unhappy people began to revile Aegeus, complaining that he, although\r\nthe author of this calamity, yet took no share in their affliction, but\r\nendured to see them left childless, robbed of their own legitimate\r\noffspring, while he made a foreigner and a bastard the heir to his\r\nkingdom. This vexed Theseus, and determining not to hold aloof, but to\r\nshare the fortunes of the people, he came forward and offered himself\r\nwithout being drawn by lot. The people all admired his courage and\r\npatriotism, and Aegeus finding that his prayers and entreaties had no\r\neffect on his unalterable resolution, proceeded to choose the rest by\r\nlot. Hellanikus says that the city did not select the youths and maidens\r\nby lot, but that Minos himself came thither and chose them, and that he\r\npicked out Theseus first of all, upon the usual conditions, which were\r\nthat the Athenians should furnish a ship, and that the youths should\r\nembark in it and sail with him, not carrying with them any weapon of\r\nwar; and that when the Minotaur was slain, the tribute should cease.\r\nFormerly, no one had any hope of safety; so they used to send out the\r\nship with a black sail, as if it were going to a certain doom; but now\r\nTheseus so encouraged his father, and boasted that he would overcome the\r\nMinotaur, that he gave a second sail, a white one, to the steersman, and\r\ncharged him on his return, if Theseus were safe, to hoist the white one,\r\nif not, the black one as a sign of mourning. But Simonides says that it\r\nwas not a white sail which was given by Aegeus, but \"a scarlet sail\r\nembrued in holm oak's juice,\" and that this was agreed on by him as the\r\nsignal of safety. The ship was steered by Phereklus the son of Amarsyas,\r\naccording to Simonides.\r\n\r\nBut Philochorus says that Theseus had one Nausithous sent him from\r\nSkirus of Salamis, to steer the ship, and Phaeax to act as look-out, as\r\nthe Athenians had not yet turned their attention to the sea.\r\n\r\nOne of the youths chosen by lot was Menestheos the son of Skirus's\r\ndaughter. The truth of this account is attested by the shrines of\r\nNausithous and Phaeax, which Theseus built at Phalerum, and by the feast\r\ncalled the Kybernesia or pilot's festival, which is held in their\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\nXVIII. When the lots were drawn Theseus brought the chosen youths from\r\nthe Prytaneum, and proceeding to the temple of the Delphian Apollo,\r\noffered the suppliants' bough to Apollo on their behalf. This was a\r\nbough of the sacred olive-tree bound with fillets of white wool. And\r\nafter praying he went to sea on the sixth day of the month Munychion, on\r\nwhich day even now they send maidens as suppliants to the temple of the\r\nDelphian Apollo. And there is a legend that the Delphian oracle told him\r\nthat Aphrodite would be his guide and fellow-traveller, and that when he\r\nwas sacrificing a she-goat to her by the seaside, it became a he-goat;\r\nwherefore the goddess is called Epitragia.\r\n\r\nXIX. When they reached Crete, according to most historians and poets,\r\nAriadne fell in love with him, and from her he received the clue of\r\nstring, and was taught how to thread the mazes of the Labyrinth. He slew\r\nthe Minotaur, and, taking with him Ariadne and the youths, sailed away.\r\nPherekydes also says that Theseus also knocked out the bottoms of the\r\nCretan ships, to prevent pursuit. But Demon says that Taurus, Minos's\r\ngeneral, was slain in a sea-fight in the harbour, when Theseus sailed\r\naway. But according to Philochorus, when Minos instituted his games,\r\nTaurus was expected to win every prize, and was grudged this honour; for\r\nhis great influence and his unpopular manners made him disliked, and\r\nscandal said, that he was too intimate with Pasiphae. On this account,\r\nwhen Theseus offered to contend with him, Minos agreed. And, as it was\r\nthe custom in Crete for women as well as men to be spectators of the\r\ngames, Ariadne was present, and was struck with the appearance of\r\nTheseus, and his strength, as he conquered all competitors. Minos was\r\nespecially pleased, in the wrestling match, at Taurus's defeat and\r\nshame, and, restoring the children to Theseus, remitted the tribute for\r\nthe future. Kleidemus tells the story in his own fashion and at\r\nunnecessary length, beginning much farther back. There was, he says, a\r\ndecree passed by all the Greeks, that no ship should sail from any post\r\nwith more than five hands on board, but Jason alone, the master of the\r\ngreat ship Argo, should cruise about, and keep the sea free of pirates.\r\nNow when Daedalus fled to Athens, Minos, contrary to the decree, pursued\r\nhim in long war galleys, and being driven to Sicily by a storm, died\r\nthere. When his son Deukalion sent a warlike message to the Athenians,\r\nbidding them give up Daedalus to him, or else threatening that he would\r\nput to death the children whom Minos had taken as hostages, Theseus\r\nreturned him a gentle answer, begging for the life of Daedalus, who was\r\nhis own cousin and blood relation, being the son of Merope, the daughter\r\nof Erechtheus. But he busied himself with building a fleet, some of it\r\nin Attica, in the country of the Thymaitadae, far from any place of\r\nresort of strangers, and some in Troezen, under the management of\r\nPittheus, as he did not wish his preparations to be known. But when the\r\nships were ready to set sail, having with him as pilots, Daedalus\r\nhimself and some Cretan exiles, as no one knew that he was coming, and\r\nthe Cretans thought that it was a friendly fleet that was advancing, he\r\nseized the harbour, and marched at once to Knossus before his arrival\r\nwas known. Then he fought a battle at the gates of the Labyrinth, and\r\nslew Deukalion and his body-guard. As Ariadne now succeeded to the\r\nthrone, he made peace with her, took back the youths, and formed an\r\nalliance between the Cretans and the Athenians, in which each nation\r\nswore that it would not begin a war against the other.\r\n\r\nXX. There are many more stories about these events, and about Ariadne,\r\nnone of which agree in any particulars. Some say that she hanged herself\r\nwhen deserted by Theseus, and some, that she was taken to Naxos by his\r\nsailors, and there dwelt with Oenarus, the priest of Dionysus, having\r\nbeen deserted by Theseus, who was in love with another.\r\n\r\n    \"For Aegle's love disturbed his breast.\"\r\n\r\nThis line, we are told by Hereas of Megara, was struck out of Hesiod's\r\npoems by Peisistratus; and again he says that he inserted into Homer's\r\ndescription of the Shades,\r\n\r\n    \"Peirithous and Theseus, born of gods,\"\r\n\r\nto please the Athenians. Some writers say that Theseus had by Ariadne\r\ntwo sons, Staphylus and Oenopion, whom Ion of Chios follows when he\r\nspeaks of his own native city as that\r\n\r\n    \"Which erst Oenopion stablished, Theseus' son.\"\r\n\r\nThe pleasantest of these legends are in nearly every one's mouth. But\r\nPaeon of Amathus gives an account peculiar to himself, that Theseus was\r\ndriven by a storm to Cyprus, and that Ariadne, who was pregnant,\r\nsuffered much from the motion of the ship, and became so ill, that she\r\nwas set on shore, but Theseus had to return to take charge of the ship,\r\nand was blown off to sea. The women of the country took care of Ariadne,\r\nand comforted her in her bereavement, even bringing forged letters to\r\nher as if from Theseus, and rendering her assistance during her\r\nconfinement; and when she died in childbirth, they buried her. Theseus,\r\non his return, grieved much, and left money to the people of the\r\ncountry, bidding them sacrifice to Ariadne; he also set up two little\r\nstatues, one of silver, and the other of brass. And at this sacrifice,\r\nwhich takes place on the second day of the month Gorpiaeus, one of the\r\nyoung men lies down on the ground, and imitates the cries of a woman in\r\ntravail; and the people of Amathus call that the grove of Ariadne\r\nAphrodite, in which they show her tomb.\r\n\r\nBut some writers of Naxos tell a different story, peculiar to\r\nthemselves, that there were two Minoses and two Ariadnes, of whom one,\r\nthey say, was married to Dionysus in Naxos, and was the mother of\r\nStaphylus and his brother, while the younger was carried off by Theseus,\r\nand came to Naxos after he deserted her; and a nurse called Korkyne came\r\nwith her, whose tomb they point out. Then Naxians also says that this\r\nAriadne died there, and is honoured, but not so much as the elder; for\r\nat the feast in honour of the elder, there are merriment and revelry,\r\nbut at that of the younger gloomy rites are mingled with mirth.\r\n\r\nXXI. Theseus, when he sailed away from Crete, touched at Delos; here he\r\nsacrificed to the god and offered up the statue of Aphrodite, which\r\nAriadne had given him; and besides this, he and the youths with him\r\ndanced a measure which they say is still practised by the people of\r\nDelos to this day, being an imitation of the turnings and windings of\r\nthe Labyrinth expressed by complicated evolutions performed in regular\r\norder. This kind of dance is called by the Delians \"the crane dance,\"\r\naccording to Dikaearchus. It was danced round the altar of the Horns,\r\nwhich is all formed of horns from the left side. They also say that he\r\ninstituted games at Delos, and that then for the first time a palm was\r\ngiven by him to the victor.\r\n\r\nXXII. As he approached Attica, both he and his steersman in their\r\ndelight forgot to hoist the sail which was to be a signal of their\r\nsafety to Aegeus; and he in his despair flung himself down the cliffs\r\nand perished. Theseus, as soon as he reached the harbour, performed at\r\nPhalerum the sacrifices which he had vowed to the gods if he returned\r\nsafe, and sent off a herald to the city with the news of his safe\r\nreturn. This man met with many who were lamenting the death of the king,\r\nand, as was natural, with others who were delighted at the news of their\r\nsafety, and who congratulated him and wished to crown him with garlands.\r\nThese he received, but placed them on his herald's staff, and when he\r\ncame back to the seashore, finding that Theseus had not completed his\r\nlibation, he waited outside the temple, not wishing to disturb the\r\nsacrifice. When the libation was finished he announced the death of\r\nAegeus, and then they all hurried up to the city with loud lamentations:\r\nwherefore to this day, at the Oschophoria, they say that it is not the\r\nherald that is crowned, but his staff, and that at the libations the\r\nbystanders cry out, \"Eleleu, Iou, Iou;\" of which cries the first is used\r\nby men in haste, or raising the paean for battle, while the second is\r\nused by persons in surprise and trouble.\r\n\r\nTheseus, after burying his father, paid his vow to Apollo, on the\r\nseventh day of the month Pyanepsion; for on this day it was that the\r\nrescued youths went up into the city. The boiling of pulse, which is\r\ncustomary on this anniversary, is said to be done because the rescued\r\nyouths put what remained of their pulse together into one pot, boiled it\r\nall, and merrily feasted on it together. And on this day also, the\r\nAthenians carry about the Eiresione, a bough of the olive tree garlanded\r\nwith wool, just as Theseus had before carried the suppliants' bough, and\r\ncovered with first-fruits of all sorts of produce, because the\r\nbarrenness of the land ceased on that day; and they sing,\r\n\r\n    \"Eiresione, bring us figs\r\n       And wheaten loaves, and oil,\r\n    And wine to quaff, that we may all\r\n       Host merrily from toil.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, some say that these ceremonies are performed in memory of the\r\nHerakleidae, who were thus entertained by the Athenians; but most\r\nwriters tell the tale as I have told it.\r\n\r\nXXIII. Now the thirty-oared ship, in which Theseus sailed with the\r\nyouths, and came back safe, was kept by the Athenians up to the time of\r\nDemetrius Phalereus. They constantly removed the decayed part of her\r\ntimbers, and renewed them with sound wood, so that the ship became an\r\nillustration to philosophers of the doctrine of growth and change, as\r\nsome argued that it remained the same, and others, that it did not\r\nremain the same. The feast of the Oschophoria, or of carrying boughs,\r\nwhich to this day the Athenians celebrate, was instituted by Theseus.\r\nFor he did not take with him all the maidens who were drawn by lot, but\r\nhe chose two youths, his intimate friends, who were feminine and fair to\r\nlook upon, but of manly spirit; these by warm baths and avoiding the\r\nheat of the sun and careful tending of their hair and skin he\r\ncompletely metamorphosed, teaching them to imitate the voice and\r\ncarriage and walk of maidens. These two were then substituted in the\r\nplace of two of the girls, and deceived every one; and when they\r\nreturned, he and these two youths walked in procession, dressed as now\r\nthose who carry boughs at the Oschophoria are dressed. They carry them\r\nin honour of Dionysus and Ariadne, because of the legend, or rather\r\nbecause they returned home when the harvest was being gathered in. And\r\nthe women called supper-carriers join in carrying them and partake of\r\nthe sacrifice, in imitation of the mothers of those who were drawn by\r\nlot; for they used continually to bring their children food. Also, old\r\ntales are told, because these women used to tell their children such\r\nones, to encourage and amuse them.\r\n\r\nThese things are related by the historian Demus. Moreover, a sacred\r\nenclosure was dedicated to Theseus, and those families out of whom the\r\ntribute of the children had been gathered were bidden to contribute to\r\nsacrifices to him. These sacrifices were presided over by the\r\nPhytalidae, which post Theseus bestowed upon them as a recompense for\r\ntheir hospitality towards him.\r\n\r\nXXIV. After the death of Aegeus, Theseus conceived a great and important\r\ndesign. He gathered together all the inhabitants of Attica and made them\r\ncitizens of one city, whereas before they had lived dispersed, so as to\r\nbe hard to assemble together for the common weal, and at times even\r\nfighting with one another.\r\n\r\nHe visited all the villages and tribes, and won their consent; the poor\r\nand lower classes gladly accepting his proposals, while he gained over\r\nthe more powerful by promising that the new constitution should not\r\ninclude a king, but that it should be a pure commonwealth, with himself\r\nmerely acting as general of its army and guardian of its laws, while in\r\nother respects it would allow perfect freedom and equality to every one.\r\nBy these arguments he convinced some of them, and the rest knowing his\r\npower and courage chose rather to be persuaded than forced into\r\ncompliance. He therefore destroyed the prytaneia, the senate house, and\r\nthe magistracy of each individual township, built one common prytaneum\r\nand senate house for them all on the site of the present acropolis,\r\ncalled the city Athens, and instituted the Panathenaic festival common\r\nto all of them. He also instituted a festival for the resident aliens,\r\non the sixteenth of the month, Hekatombeion, which is still kept up. And\r\nhaving, according to his promise, laid down his sovereign power, he\r\narranged the new constitution under the auspices of the gods; for he\r\nmade inquiry at Delphi as to how he should deal with the city, and\r\nreceived the following answer:\r\n\r\n    \"Thou son of Aegeus and of Pittheus' maid,\r\n    My father hath within thy city laid\r\n    The bounds of many cities; weigh not down\r\n    Thy soul with thought; the bladder cannot drown.\"\r\n\r\nThe same thing they say was afterwards prophesied by the Sibyl\r\nconcerning the city, in these words:\r\n\r\n     \"The bladder may be dipped, but cannot drown.\"\r\n\r\nXXV. Wishing still further to increase the number of his citizens, he\r\ninvited all strangers to come and share equal privileges, and they say\r\nthat the words now used, \"Come hither all ye peoples,\" was the\r\nproclamation then used by Theseus, establishing as it were a\r\ncommonwealth of all nations. But he did not permit his state to fall\r\ninto the disorder which this influx of all kinds of people would\r\nprobably have produced, but divided the people into three classes, of\r\nEupatridae or nobles, Geomori or farmers, Demiurgi or artisans. To the\r\nEupatridae he assigned the care of religious rites, the supply of\r\nmagistrates for the city, and the interpretation of the laws and customs\r\nsacred or profane, yet he placed them on an equality with the other\r\ncitizens, thinking that the nobles would always excel in dignity, the\r\nfarmers in usefulness, and the artisans in numbers. Aristotle tells us\r\nthat he was the first who inclined to democracy, and gave up the title\r\nof king; and Homer seems to confirm this view by speaking of the people\r\nof the Athenians alone of all the states mentioned in his catalogue of\r\nships. Theseus also struck money with the figure of a bull, either\r\nalluding to the bull of Marathon, or Taurus, Minos' general, or else to\r\nencourage farming among the citizens. Hence they say came the words,\r\n\"worth ten,\" or \"worth a hundred oxen.\" He permanently annexed Megara to\r\nAttica, and set up the famous pillar on the Isthmus, on which he wrote\r\nthe distinction between the countries in two trimeter lines, of which\r\nthe one looking east says,\r\n\r\n     \"This is not Peloponnesus, but Ionia,\"\r\n\r\nand the one looking west says,\r\n\r\n     \"This is Peloponnesus, not Ionia.\"\r\n\r\nAnd also he instituted games there, in emulation of Herakles; that, just\r\nas Herakles had ordained that the Greeks should celebrate the Olympic\r\ngames in honour of Zeus, so by Theseus's appointment they should\r\ncelebrate the Isthmian games in honour of Poseidon.\r\n\r\nThe festival which was previously established there in honour of\r\nMelikerta used to be celebrated by night, and to be more like a\r\nreligious mystery than a great spectacle and gathering. Some writers\r\nassert that the Isthmian games were established in honour of Skeiron,\r\nand that Theseus wished to make them an atonement for the murder of his\r\nkinsman; for Skeiron was the son of Kanethus and of Henioche the\r\ndaughter of Pittheus. Others say that this festival was established in\r\nhonour of Sinis, not of Skeiron. Be this as it may, Theseus established\r\nit, and stipulated with the Corinthians that visitors from Athens who\r\ncame to the games should have a seat of honour in as large a space as\r\ncould be covered by a sail of the public ship which carried them, when\r\nstretched out on the ground. This we are told by Hellanikus and Andron\r\nof Halikarnassus.\r\n\r\nXXVI. Besides this, according to Philochorus and other writers, he\r\nsailed with Herakles to the Euxine, took part in the campaign against\r\nthe Amazons, and received Antiope as the reward for his valour; but most\r\nhistorians, among whom are Pherekydes, Hellanikus, and Herodorus, say\r\nthat Theseus made an expedition of his own later than that of Herakles,\r\nand that he took the Amazon captive, which is a more reasonable story.\r\nFor no one of his companions is said to have captured an Amazon; while\r\nBion relates that he caught this one by treachery and carried her off;\r\nfor the Amazons, he says, were not averse to men, and did not avoid\r\nTheseus when he touched at their coast, but even offered him presents.\r\nHe invited the bearer of these on board his ship; and when she had\r\nembarked he set sail. But one, Menekrates, who has written a history of\r\nthe town of Nikaea in Bithynia, states that Theseus spent a long time in\r\nthat country with Antiope, and that there were three young Athenians,\r\nbrothers, who were his companions in arms, by name Euneon, Thoas, and\r\nSoloeis. Soloeis fell in love with Antiope, and, without telling his\r\nbrothers, confided his passion to one of his comrades. This man laid the\r\nmatter before Antiope, who firmly rejected his pretensions, but treated\r\nhim quietly and discreetly, telling Theseus nothing about it. Soloeis,\r\nin despair at his rejection, leaped into a river and perished; and\r\nTheseus then at length learned the cause of the young man's death. In\r\nhis sorrow he remembered and applied to himself an oracle he had\r\nreceived from Delphi. It had been enjoined upon him by the Pythia that\r\nwhenever he should be struck down with special sorrow in a foreign land,\r\nhe should found a city in that place and leave some of his companions\r\nthere as its chiefs. In consequence of this the city which he founded\r\nwas called Pythopolis, in honour of the Pythian Apollo, and the\r\nneighbouring river was called Soloeis, after the youth who died in it.\r\nHe left there the brothers of Soloeis as the chiefs and lawgivers of the\r\nnew city, and together, with them one Hermus, an Athenian Eupatrid. In\r\nconsequence of this, the people of Pythopolis call a certain place in\r\ntheir city the house of Hermes, by a mistaken accentuation transferring\r\nthe honour due to their founder, to their god Hermes.\r\n\r\nXXVII. This was the origin of the war with the Amazons; and it seems to\r\nhave been carried on in no feeble or womanish spirit, for they never\r\ncould have encamped in the city nor have fought a battle close to the\r\nPnyx and the Museum unless they had conquered the rest of the country,\r\nso as to be able to approach the city safely. It is hard to believe, as\r\nHellanikus relates, that they crossed the Cimmerian Bosphorus on the\r\nice; but that they encamped almost in the city is borne witness to by\r\nthe local names, and by the tombs of the fallen. For a long time both\r\nparties held aloof, unwilling to engage; but at last Theseus, after\r\nsacrificing to Phobos (Fear), attacked them. The battle took place in\r\nthe month Boedromion, on the day on which the Athenians celebrate the\r\nfeast Boedromia. Kleidemus gives us accurate details, stating that the\r\nleft wing of the Amazons stood at the place now called the Amazoneum,\r\nwhile the right reached up to the Pnyx, at the place where the gilded\r\nfigure of Victory now stands. The Athenians attacked them on this side,\r\nissuing from the Museum, and the tombs of the fallen are to be seen\r\nalong the street which leads to the gate near the shrine of the hero\r\nChalkodus, which is called the Peiraeic gate. On this side the women\r\nforced them back as far as the temple of the Eumenides, but on the other\r\nside those who assailed them from the temple of Pallas, Ardettus, and\r\nthe Lyceum, drove their right wing in confusion back to their camp with\r\ngreat slaughter. In the fourth month of the war a peace was brought\r\nabout by Hippolyte; for this writer names the wife of Theseus Hippolyte,\r\nnot Antiope. Some relate that she was slain fighting by the side of\r\nTheseus by a javelin hurled by one Molpadia, and that the column which\r\nstands beside the temple of Olympian Earth is sacred to her memory. It\r\nis not to be wondered at that history should be at fault when dealing\r\nwith such ancient events as these, for there is another story at\r\nvariance with this, to the effect that Antiope caused the wounded\r\nAmazons to be secretly transported to Chalkis, where they were taken\r\ncare of, and some of them were buried there, at what is now called the\r\nAmazoneum. However, it is a proof of the war having ended in a treaty of\r\npeace, that the place near the temple of Theseus where they swore to\r\nobserve it, is still called Horeomosium, and that the sacrifice to the\r\nAmazons always has taken place before the festival of Theseus. The\r\npeople of Megara also show a burying-place of the Amazons, as one goes\r\nfrom the market-place to what they call Rhus, where the lozenge-shaped\r\nbuilding stands. It is said that some others died at Chaeronea, and were\r\nburied by the little stream which it seems was anciently called\r\nThermodon, but now is called Haemon, about which we have treated in the\r\nlife of Demosthenes. It would appear that the Amazons did not even get\r\nacross Thessaly without trouble, for graves of them are shown to this\r\nday at Skotussa and Kynoskephalae.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. The above is all that is worthy of mention about the Amazons;\r\nfor, as to the story which the author of the 'Theseid' relates about\r\nthis attack of the Amazons being brought about by Antiope to revenge\r\nherself upon Theseus for his marriage with Phaedra, and how she and her\r\nAmazons fought, and how Herakles slew them, all this is clearly\r\nfabulous. After the death of Antiope, Theseus married Phaedra, having a\r\nson by Antiope named Hippolytus, or Demophoon, according to Pindar. As\r\nfor his misfortunes with this wife and son, as the account given by\r\nhistorians does not differ from that which appears in the plays of the\r\ntragic poets, we must believe them to have happened as all these writers\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nXXIX. However, there are certain other legends about Theseus' marriage\r\nwhich have never appeared on the stage, which have neither a creditable\r\nbeginning nor a prosperous termination: for it is said that he carried\r\noff one Anaxo, a Troezenian girl, and after slaying Sinis and Kerkyon he\r\nforced their daughters, and that he married Periboea the mother of Ajax\r\nand also Phereboea and Iope the daughter of Iphikles: and, as has been\r\ntold already, it was on account of his love for Aegle the daughter of\r\nPanopeus that he deserted Ariadne, which was a shameful and\r\ndiscreditable action. And in addition to all this he is charged with\r\ncarrying off Helen, which brought war upon Attica, and exile and\r\ndestruction on himself; about which we shall speak presently. But,\r\nthough many adventures were undertaken by the heroes of those times,\r\nHerodorus is of opinion that Theseus took no part in any of them, except\r\nwith the Lapithae in their fight with the Centaurs; though other writers\r\nsay that he went to Kolchis with Jason and took part with Meleager in\r\nthe hunt of the Kalydonian boar.\r\n\r\nFrom these legends arises the proverb, \"Not without Theseus;\" also he by\r\nhimself without any comrades performed many glorious deeds, from which\r\nthe saying came into vogue, \"This is another Herakles.\"\r\n\r\nTheseus, together with Adrastus, effected the recovery of the bodies of\r\nthose who fell under the walls of the Cadmea at Thebes, not after\r\nconquering the Thebans, as Euripides puts it in his play, but by a truce\r\nand convention, according to most writers. Philochorus even states that\r\nthis was the first occasion on which a truce was made for the recovery\r\nof those slain in battle. But we have shown in our 'Life of Herakles'\r\nthat he was the first to restore the corpses of the slain to the enemy.\r\nThe tombs of the rank and file are to be seen at Eleutherae, but those\r\nof the chiefs at Eleusis, by favour of Theseus to Adrastus. Euripides's\r\nplay of the 'Suppliants' is contradicted by that of Aeschylus, the\r\n'Eleusinians,' in which Theseus is introduced giving orders for this to\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\nXXX. His friendship for Peirithous is said to have arisen in the\r\nfollowing manner: He had a great reputation for strength and courage;\r\nPeirithous, wishing to make trial of these, drove his cattle away from\r\nthe plain of Marathon, and when he learned that Theseus was pursuing\r\nthem, armed, he did not retire, but turned and faced him. Each man then\r\nadmiring the beauty and courage of his opponent, refrained from battle,\r\nand first Peirithous holding out his hand bade Theseus himself assess\r\nthe damages of his raid upon the cattle, saying that he himself would\r\nwillingly submit to whatever penalty the other might inflict. Theseus\r\nthought no more of their quarrel, and invited him to become his friend\r\nand comrade; and they ratified their compact of friendship by an oath.\r\nHereupon, Peirithous, who was about to marry Deidameia, begged Theseus\r\nto come and visit his country and meet the Lapithae. He also had invited\r\nthe Centaurs to the banquet; and as they in their drunken insolence laid\r\nhands upon the women, the Lapithae attacked them. Some of them they\r\nslew, and the rest they overcame, and afterwards, with the assistance of\r\nTheseus, banished from their country. Herodorus, however, says that this\r\nis not how these events took place, but that the war was going on, and\r\nthat Theseus went to help the Lapithae and while on his way thither\r\nfirst beheld Herakles, whom he made a point of visiting at Trachis,\r\nwhere he was resting after his labours and wanderings; and that they met\r\nwith many compliments and much good feeling on both sides. But one would\r\nmore incline to those writers who tell us that they often met, and that\r\nHerakles was initiated by Theseus's desire, and was also purified before\r\ninitiation at his instance, which ceremony was necessary because of some\r\nreckless action.\r\n\r\nXXXI. Theseus was fifty years old, according to Hellanikus, when he\r\ncarried off Helen, who was a mere child. For this reason some who wish\r\nto clear him of this, the heaviest of all the charges against him, say\r\nthat it was not he who carried off Helen, but that Idas and Lynkeus\r\ncarried her off and deposited her in his keeping. Afterwards the Twin\r\nBrethren came and demanded her back, but he would not give her up; or\r\neven it is said that Tyndareus himself handed her over to him, because\r\nhe feared that Enarsphorus the son of Hippocoon would take her by force,\r\nshe being only a child at the time. But the most probable story and that\r\nwhich most writers agree in is the following: The two friends, Theseus\r\nand Peirithous, came to Sparta, seized the maiden, who was dancing in\r\nthe temple of Artemis Orthia, and carried her off. As the pursuers\r\nfollowed no farther than Tegea, they felt no alarm, but leisurely\r\ntravelled through Peloponnesus, and made a compact that whichever of\r\nthem should win Helen by lot was to have her to wife, but must help the\r\nother to a marriage. They cast lots on this understanding, and Theseus\r\nwon. As the maiden was not yet ripe for marriage he took her with him to\r\nAphidnae, and there placing his mother with her gave her into the charge\r\nof his friend Aphidnus, bidding him watch over her and keep her presence\r\nsecret. He himself in order to repay his obligation to Peirithous went\r\non a journey with him to Epirus to obtain the daughter of Aidoneus the\r\nking of the Molossians, who called his wife Persephone, his daughter\r\nKore, and his dog Cerberus. All the suitors of his daughter were bidden\r\nby him to fight this dog, and the victor was to receive her hand.\r\nHowever, as he learned that Peirithous and his friend were come, not as\r\nwooers, but as ravishers, he cast them into prison. He put an end to\r\nPeirithous at once, by means of his dog, but only guarded Theseus\r\nstrictly.\r\n\r\nXXXII. Now at this period Mnestheus, the son of Peteus, who was the son\r\nof Orneus, who was the son of Erechtheus, first of all mankind they say\r\ntook to the arts of a demagogue, and to currying favour with the people.\r\nThis man formed a league of the nobles, who had long borne Theseus a\r\ngrudge for having destroyed the local jurisdiction and privileges of\r\neach of the Eupatrids by collecting them all together into the capital,\r\nwhere they were no more than his subjects and slaves; and he also\r\nexcited the common people by telling them that although they were\r\nenjoying a fancied freedom they really had been deprived of their\r\nancestral privileges and sacred rites, and made to endure the rule of\r\none foreign despot, instead of that of many good kings of their own\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nWhile he was thus busily employed, the invasion of Attica by the sons of\r\nTyndareus greatly assisted his revolutionary scheme; so that some say\r\nthat it was he who invited them to come. At first they abstained from\r\nviolence, and confined themselves to asking that their sister Helen\r\nshould be given up to them; but when they were told by the citizens that\r\nshe was not in their hands, and that they knew not where she was, they\r\nproceeded to warlike measures. Akademus, who had by some means\r\ndiscovered that she was concealed at Aphidnae, now told them where she\r\nwas; for which cause he was honoured by the sons of Tyndareus during his\r\nlife, and also the Lacedaemonians, though they often invaded the country\r\nand ravaged it unsparingly, yet never touched the place called the\r\nAkademeia, for Akademus's sake. Dikaearchus says that Echemus and\r\nMarathus, two Arcadians, took part in that war with the sons of\r\nTyndareus; and that from the first the place now called Akademeia was\r\nthen named Echedemia, and that from the second the township of Marathon\r\ntakes its names, because he in accordance with some oracle voluntarily\r\noffered himself as a sacrifice there in the sight of the whole army.\r\n\r\nHowever, the sons of Tyndareus came to Aphidnae, and took the place\r\nafter a battle, in which it is said that Alykus fell, the son of\r\nSkeiron, who then was fighting on the side of the Dioskuri. In memory\r\nof this man it is said that the place in the territory of Megara where\r\nhis remains lie is called Alykus. But Hereas writes that Alykus was\r\nslain by Theseus at Aphidnae, and as evidence he quotes this verse about\r\nAlykus,\r\n\r\n    \"Him whom Theseus slew in the spacious streets of Aphidnae,\r\n    Fighting for fair-haired Helen.\"\r\n\r\nBut it is not likely that if Theseus had been there, his mother and the\r\ntown of Aphidnae would have been taken.\r\n\r\nXXXIII. After the fall of Aphidnae, the people of Athens became\r\nterrified, and were persuaded by Mnestheus to admit the sons of\r\nTyndareus to the city, and to treat them as friends, because, he said,\r\nthey were only at war with Theseus, who had been the first to use\r\nviolence, and were the saviours and benefactors of the rest of mankind.\r\nThese words of his were confirmed by their behaviour, for, victorious as\r\nthey were, they yet demanded nothing except initiation into the\r\nmysteries, as they were, no less than Herakles, connected with the city.\r\nThis was permitted them, and they were adopted by Aphidnus, as Herakles\r\nhad been by Pylius. They received divine honours, being addressed as\r\n\"Anakes,\" either because of the cessation of the war, or from the care\r\nthey took, when they had such a large army within the walls of Athens,\r\nthat no one should be wronged; for those who take care of or guard\r\nanything are said to do it \"anakos,\" and perhaps for this reason kings\r\nare called \"Anaktes.\" Some say that they were called Anakas because of\r\nthe appearance of their stars in the heavens above, for the Attics\r\ncalled \"above\" \"anekas.\"\r\n\r\nXXXIV. It is said that Aethra, the mother of Theseus, was carried off as\r\na captive to Lacedaemon, and thence to Troy with Helen, and Homer\r\nsupports this view, when he says that there followed Helen,\r\n\r\n    \"Aithra the daughter of Pittheus and large-eyed Klymene.\"\r\n\r\nOthers reject this verse, and the legend about Mounychus, who is said to\r\nhave been the bastard son of Laodike, by Demophoon, and to have been\r\nbrought up in Troy by Aithra. But Istrus, in his thirteenth book of his\r\n'History of Attica,' tells quite a different and peculiar story about\r\nAithra, that he had heard that Paris was conquered by Achilles and\r\nPatroklus near the river Spercheius, in Thessaly, and that Hector took\r\nthe city of Troezen by storm, and amongst the plunder carried off\r\nAithra, who had been left there. But this seems impossible.\r\n\r\nXXXV. Now Aidoneus the Molossian king chanced to be entertaining\r\nHerakles, and related to him the story of Theseus and Peirithous, what\r\nthey had intended to do, and how they had been caught in the act and\r\npunished. Herakles was much grieved at hearing how one had perished\r\ningloriously, and the other was like to perish. He thought that nothing\r\nwould be gained by reproaching the king for his conduct to Peirithous,\r\nbut he begged for the life of Theseus, and pointed out that the release\r\nof his friend was a favour which he deserved. Aidoneus agreed, and\r\nTheseus, when set free, returned to Athens, where he found that his\r\nparty was not yet overpowered. Whatever consecrated grounds had been set\r\napart for him by the city, he dedicated to Herakles, and called Heraklea\r\ninstead of Thesea, except four, according to Philochorus. But, as he at\r\nonce wished to preside and manage the state as before, he was met by\r\nfactious opposition, for he found that those who had been his enemies\r\nbefore, had now learned not to fear him, while the common people had\r\nbecome corrupted, and now required to be specially flattered instead of\r\ndoing their duty in silence.\r\n\r\nHe endeavoured to establish his government by force, but was overpowered\r\nby faction; and at last, despairing of success, he secretly sent his\r\nchildren to Euboea, to Elephenor, the son of Chalkodous; and he himself,\r\nafter solemnly uttering curses on the Athenians at Gargettus, where now\r\nis the place called Araterion, or the place of curses, set sail for\r\nSkyros, where he was, he imagined, on friendly terms with the\r\ninhabitants, and possessed a paternal estate in the island. At that time\r\nLykomedes was king of Skyros; so he proceeded to demand from him his\r\nlands, in order to live there, though some say that he asked him to\r\nassist him against the Athenians. Lykomedes, either in fear of the great\r\nreputation of Theseus, or else to gain the favour of Mnestheus, led him\r\nup to the highest mountain top in the country, on the pretext of\r\nshowing him his estate from thence, and pushed him over a precipice.\r\nSome say that he stumbled and fell of himself, as he was walking after\r\nsupper, according to his custom. As soon as he was dead, no one thought\r\nany more of him, but Mnestheus reigned over the Athenians, while\r\nTheseus's children were brought up as private citizens by Elephenor, and\r\nfollowed him to Ilium. When Mnestheus died at Ilium, they returned home\r\nand resumed their rightful sovereignty. In subsequent times, among many\r\nother things which led the Athenians to honour Theseus as a hero or\r\ndemi-god, most remarkable was his appearance at the battle of Marathon,\r\nwhere his spirit was seen by many, clad in armour, leading the charge\r\nagainst the barbarians.\r\n\r\nXXXVI. After the Persian war, in the archonship of Phaedo, the Athenians\r\nwere told by the Delphian Oracle to take home the bones of Theseus and\r\nkeep them with the greatest care and honour. There was great difficulty\r\nin obtaining them and in discovering his tomb, on account of the wild\r\nand savage habits of the natives of the island. However, Kimon took the\r\nisland, as is written in my history of his Life, and making it a point\r\nof honour to discover his tomb, he chanced to behold an eagle pecking\r\nwith its beak and scratching with its talons at a small rising ground.\r\nHere he dug, imagining that the spot had been pointed out by a miracle.\r\nThere was found the coffin of a man of great stature, and lying beside\r\nit a brazen lance-head and a sword. These relics were brought to Athens\r\nby Kimon, on board of his trireme, and the delighted Athenians received\r\nthem with splendid processions and sacrifices, just as if the hero\r\nhimself were come to the city. He is buried in the midst of the city,\r\nnear where the Gymnasium now stands, and his tomb is a place of\r\nsanctuary for slaves, and all that are poor and oppressed, because\r\nTheseus, during his life, was the champion and avenger of the poor, and\r\nalways kindly hearkened to their prayers. Their greatest sacrifice in\r\nhis honour takes place on the eighth of the month of Pyanepsion, upon\r\nwhich day he and the youths came back from Crete. But besides this they\r\nhold a service in his honour on the eighth of all the other months,\r\neither because it was on the eighth day of Hekatombeion that he first\r\narrived in Athens from Troezen, as is related by Diodorus the\r\ntopographer, or else thinking that number to be especially his own,\r\nbecause he is said to have been the son of Poseidon, and Poseidon is\r\nhonoured on the eighth day of every month. For the number eight is the\r\nfirst cube of an even number, and is double the first square, and\r\ntherefore peculiarly represents the immovable abiding power of that god\r\nwhom we address as \"the steadfast,\" and the \"earth upholder.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF ROMULUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistorians are not agreed upon the origin and meaning of the famous name\r\nof Rome, which is so celebrated through all the world. Some relate that\r\nthe Pelasgi, after wandering over the greater part of the world, and\r\nconquering most nations, settled there, and gave the city its name from\r\ntheir own strength in battle.[A] Others tell us that after the capture\r\nof Troy some fugitives obtained ships, were carried by the winds to the\r\nTyrrhenian or Tuscan coast, and cast anchor in the Tiber. There the\r\nwomen, who had suffered much from the sea voyage, were advised by one\r\nwho was accounted chief among them for wisdom and noble birth, Roma by\r\nname, to burn the ships. At first the men were angry at this, but\r\nafterwards, being compelled to settle round about the Palatine Hill,\r\nthey fared better than they expected, as they found the country fertile\r\nand the neighbours hospitable; so they paid great honour to Roma, and\r\ncalled the city after her name. From this circumstance, they say, arose\r\nthe present habit of women kissing their male relatives and connections;\r\nbecause those women, after they had burned the ships, thus embraced and\r\ncaressed the men, trying to pacify their rage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The Greek [Greek: rhômê] = strength.]\r\n\r\nII. Some say that Roma, who gave the name to the city, was the daughter\r\nof Italus and Leucaria, or of Telephus the son of Hercules, and the wife\r\nof Aeneas, while others say that she was the daughter of Ascanius the\r\nson of Aeneas. Others relate that Romanus, the son of Odysseus and\r\nCirce, founded the city, or that it was Romus, the son of Hemathion, who\r\nwas sent from Troy by Diomedes; or Romis the despot of the Latins, who\r\ndrove out of his kingdom the Tyrrhenians, who, starting from Thessaly,\r\nhad made their way to Lydia, and thence to Italy. And even those who\r\nfollow the most reasonable of these legends, and admit that it was\r\nRomulus who founded the city after his own name, do not agree about his\r\nbirth; for some say that he was the son of Aeneas and Dexithea the\r\ndaughter of Phorbas, and with his brother Romus was brought to Italy\r\nwhen a child, and that as the river was in flood, all the other boats\r\nwere swamped, but that in which the children were was carried to a soft\r\nbank and miraculously preserved, from which the name of Rome was given\r\nto the place. Others say that Roma, the daughter of that Trojan lady,\r\nmarried Latinus the son of Telemachus and bore a son, Romulus; while\r\nothers say that his mother was Aemilia the daughter of Aeneas and\r\nLavinia, by an intrigue with Mars; while others give a completely\r\nlegendary account of his birth, as follows:\r\n\r\nIn the house of Tarchetius, the king of the Albani, a cruel and lawless\r\nman, a miracle took place. A male figure arose from the hearth, and\r\nremained there for many days. Now there was in Etruria an oracle of\r\nTethys, which told Tarchetius that a virgin must be offered to the\r\nfigure; for there should be born of her a son surpassing all mankind in\r\nstrength, valour, and good fortune. Tarchetius hereupon explained the\r\noracle to one of his daughters, and ordered her to give herself up to\r\nthe figure; but she, not liking to do so, sent her servant-maid instead.\r\nTarchetius, when he learned this, was greatly incensed, and cast them\r\nboth into prison, meaning to put them to death. However, in a dream,\r\nVesta appeared to him, forbidding him to slay them. In consequence of\r\nthis he locked them up with a loom, telling them that when they had\r\nwoven the piece of work upon it they should be married. So they wove all\r\nday, and during the night other maidens sent by Tarchetius undid their\r\nwork again. Now when the servant-maid was delivered of twins, Tarchetius\r\ngave them to one Teratius, and bade him destroy them. He laid them down\r\nnear the river; and there they were suckled by a she-wolf, while all\r\nsorts of birds brought them morsels of food, until one day a cowherd saw\r\nthem. Filled with wonder he ventured to come up to the children and\r\nbear them off. Saved from death in this manner they grew up, and then\r\nattacked and slew Tarchetius. This is the legend given by one\r\nPromathion, the compiler of a history of Italy.\r\n\r\nIII. But the most credible story, and that has most vouchers for its\r\ntruth, is that which was first published in Greece by Diokles of\r\nPeparethos, a writer whom Fabius Pictor has followed in most points.\r\nThere are variations in this legend also; but, generally speaking, it\r\nruns as follows:\r\n\r\nThe dynasty established by Aeneas at Alba Longa, came down to two\r\nbrothers, Numitor and Amulius. Amulius offered his brother the choice\r\nbetween the sovereign power and the royal treasure, including the gold\r\nbrought from Troy. Numitor chose the sovereign power. But Amulius,\r\npossessing all the treasure, and thereby having more power than his\r\nbrother, easily dethroned him, and, as he feared his brother's daughter\r\nmight have children who would avenge him, he made her a priestess of\r\nVesta, sworn to celibacy for ever. This lady is named by some Ilia, by\r\nothers Rhea or Silvia. After no long time she was found to be with\r\nchild, against the law of the Vestals. Her life was saved by the\r\nentreaties of Antho, the king's daughter, but she was closely\r\nimprisoned, that she might not be delivered without Amulius's knowledge.\r\nShe bore two children of remarkable beauty and size, and Amulius, all\r\nthe more alarmed at this, bade an attendant take them and expose them.\r\nSome say that this man's name was Faustulus, while others say that this\r\nwas not his name, but that of their rescuer. However, he placed the\r\ninfants in a cradle, and went down to the river with the intention of\r\nthrowing them into it, but seeing it running strong and turbulently, he\r\nfeared to approach it, laid down the cradle near the bank and went away.\r\nThe river, which was in flood, rose, and gently floated off the cradle,\r\nand carried it down to a soft place which is now called Cermalus, but\r\nanciently, it seems, was called Germanus, because brothers are called\r\ngermani.\r\n\r\nIV. Near this place was a fig-tree, which they called Ruminalius, either\r\nfrom Romulus, as most persons imagine, or because cattle came to\r\nruminate in its shade, or, more probably, because of the suckling of\r\nthe children there, for the ancients called the nipple _rouma_.\r\nMoreover, they call the goddess who appears to have watched over the\r\nchildren Roumilia, and to her they sacrifice offerings without wine, and\r\npour milk as a libation upon her altar.\r\n\r\nIt is said that while the infants were lying in this place, the she-wolf\r\nsuckled them, and that a woodpecker came and helped to feed and watch\r\nover them. Now these animals are sacred to the god Mars; and the Latins\r\nhave a peculiar reverence and worship for the woodpecker. These\r\ncircumstances, therefore, did not a little to confirm the tale of the\r\nmother of the children, that their father was Mars, though some say that\r\nshe was deceived by Amulius himself, who, after condemning her to a life\r\nof virginity, appeared before her dressed in armour, and ravished her.\r\nOthers say that the twofold meaning of the name of their nurse gave rise\r\nto this legend, for the Latins use the word _lupa_ for she-wolves, and\r\nalso for unchaste women, as was the wife of Faustulus, who brought up\r\nthe children, Acca Laurentia by name. To her also the Romans offer\r\nsacrifice, and in the month of April the priest of Mars brings libations\r\nto her, and the feast is called Laurentia.\r\n\r\nV. The Romans also worship another Laurentia, for this reason: The\r\npriest of Hercules, weary with idleness, proposed to the god to cast the\r\ndice on the condition that, if he won, he should receive something good\r\nfrom the god, while if he lost, he undertook to provide the god with a\r\nbountiful feast and a fair woman to take his pleasure with. Upon these\r\nconditions he cast the dice, first for the god, and then for himself,\r\nand was beaten. Wishing to settle his wager properly, and making a point\r\nof keeping his word, he prepared a feast for the god, and hired\r\nLaurentia, then in the pride of her beauty, though not yet famous. He\r\nfeasted her in the temple, where he had prepared a couch, and after\r\nsupper he locked her in, that the god might possess her. And, indeed,\r\nthe god is said to have appeared to the lady, and to have bidden her go\r\nearly in the morning into the market-place, and to embrace the first man\r\nshe met, and make him her friend. There met her a citizen far advanced\r\nin years, possessing a fair income, childless, and unmarried. His name\r\nwas Tarrutius. He took Laurentia to himself, and loved her, and upon his\r\ndeath left her heiress to a large and valuable property, the greater\r\npart of which she left by will to the city. It is related of her, that\r\nafter she had become famous, and was thought to enjoy the favour of\r\nHeaven, she vanished near the very same spot where the other Laurentia\r\nlay buried. This place is now called Velabrum, because during the\r\nfrequent overflowings of the river, people used there to be ferried over\r\nto the market-place; now they call ferrying _velatura_. Some say that\r\nthe road from the market-place to the circus, starting from this point,\r\nused to be covered with sails or awnings by those who treated the people\r\nto a spectacle; and in the Latin tongue a sail is called _velum_. This\r\nis why the second Laurentia is honoured by the Romans.\r\n\r\nVI. Now Faustulus, the swineherd of Amulius, kept the children concealed\r\nfrom every one, though some say that Numitor knew of it, and shared the\r\nexpense of their education. They were sent to Gabii to learn their\r\nletters, and everything else that well-born children should know; and\r\nthey were called Romulus and Remus, because they were first seen sucking\r\nthe wolf. Their noble birth showed itself while they were yet children,\r\nin their size and beauty; and when they grew up they were manly and\r\nhigh-spirited, of invincible courage and daring. Romulus, however, was\r\nthought the wiser and more politic of the two, and in his discussions\r\nwith the neighbours about pasture and hunting, gave them opportunities\r\nof noting that his disposition was one which led him to command rather\r\nthan to obey. On account of these qualities they were beloved by their\r\nequals and the poor, but they despised the king's officers and bailiffs\r\nas being no braver than themselves, and cared neither for their anger\r\nnor their threats. They led the lives and followed the pursuits of nobly\r\nborn men, not valuing sloth and idleness, but exercise and hunting,\r\ndefending the land against brigands, capturing plunderers, and avenging\r\nthose who had suffered wrong. And thus they became famous.\r\n\r\nVII. Now a quarrel arose between the herdsmen of Numitor and those of\r\nAmulius, and cattle were driven off by the former. Amulius's men,\r\nenraged at this, fought and routed the others, and recovered a great\r\npart of the booty. They cared nothing for Numitor's anger, but collected\r\ntogether many needy persons and slaves, and filled them with a\r\nrebellious spirit. While Romulus was absent at a sacrifice (for he was\r\nmuch addicted to sacrifices and divination), the herdsmen of Numitor\r\nfell in with Remus, accompanied by a small band, and fought with him.\r\nAfter many wounds had been received on both sides, Numitor's men\r\nconquered and took Remus alive. Remus was brought before Numitor, who\r\ndid not punish him, as he feared his brother's temper, but went to his\r\nbrother and begged for justice, saying that he had suffered wrong at the\r\nhands of the king his brother's servants. As all the people of Alba\r\nsympathised with Remus, and feared that he would be unjustly put to\r\ndeath, or worse, Amulius, alarmed at them, handed over Remus to his\r\nbrother Numitor, to deal with as he pleased. Numitor took him, and as\r\nsoon as he reached home, after admiring the bodily strength and stature\r\nof the youth, which surpassed all the rest, perceiving in his looks his\r\ncourageous and fiery spirit, undismayed by his present circumstances,\r\nand having heard that his deeds corresponded to his appearance, and\r\nabove all, as seems probable, some god being with him and watching over\r\nthe first beginnings of great events, he was struck by the idea of\r\nasking him to tell the truth as to who he was, and how he was born,\r\ngiving him confidence and encouragement by his kindly voice and looks.\r\nThe young man boldly said, \"I will conceal nothing from you, for you\r\nseem more like a king than Amulius. You hear and judge before you\r\npunish, but he gives men up to be punished without a trial. Formerly we\r\n(for we are twins) understood that we were the sons of Faustulus and\r\nLaurentia, the king's servants; but now that we are brought before you\r\nas culprits, and are falsely accused and in danger of our lives, we have\r\nheard great things about ourselves. Whether they be true or not, we must\r\nnow put to the test. Our birth is said to be a secret, and our nursing\r\nand bringing up is yet stranger, for we were cast out to the beasts and\r\nthe birds, and were fed by them, suckled by a she-wolf, and fed with\r\nmorsels of food by a woodpecker as we lay in our cradle beside the great\r\nriver. Our cradle still exists, carefully preserved, bound with brazen\r\nbands, on which is an indistinct inscription, which hereafter will serve\r\nas a means by which we may be recognised by our parents, but to no\r\npurpose if we are dead.\" Numitor, considering the young man's story, and\r\nreckoning up the time from his apparent age, willingly embraced the hope\r\nwhich was dawning on his mind, and considered how he might obtain a\r\nsecret interview with his daughter and tell her of all this; for she was\r\nstill kept a close prisoner.\r\n\r\nVIII. Faustulus, when he heard of Remus being captured and delivered up\r\nto Numitor, called upon Romulus to help him, and told him plainly all\r\nabout his birth; although previously he had hinted so much, that any one\r\nwho paid attention to his words might have known nearly all about it;\r\nand he himself with the cradle ran to Numitor full of hopes and fears,\r\nnow that matters had come to a critical point. He was viewed with\r\nsuspicion by the guards at the king's gate, and while they were treating\r\nhim contemptuously, and confusing him by questions, they espied the\r\ncradle under his cloak. Now it chanced that one of them had been one of\r\nthose who had taken the children to cast them away, and had been present\r\nwhen they were abandoned. This man, seeing the cradle and recognising it\r\nby its make and the inscription on it, suspected the truth, and at once\r\ntold the king and brought the man in to be examined. Faustulus, in those\r\ndire straits, did not altogether remain unshaken, and yet did not quite\r\nallow his secret to be wrung from him. He admitted that the boys were\r\nalive, but said that they were living far away from Alba, and that he\r\nhimself was bringing the cradle to Ilia, who had often longed to see and\r\ntouch it to confirm her belief in the life of her children. Now Amulius\r\ndid what men generally do when excited by fear or rage. He sent in a\r\ngreat hurry one who was a good man and a friend of Numitor, bidding him\r\nask Numitor whether he had heard anything about the survival of the\r\nchildren. This man on arrival, finding Numitor all but embracing Remus,\r\nconfirmed his belief that he was his grandson, and bade him take his\r\nmeasures quickly, remaining by him himself to offer assistance. Even had\r\nthey wished it, there was no time for delay; for Romulus was already\r\nnear, and no small number of the citizens, through hatred and fear of\r\nAmulius, were going out to join him. He himself brought no small force,\r\narrayed in companies of a hundred each. Each of these was led by a man\r\nwho carried a bundle of sticks and straw upon a pole. The Latins called\r\nthese _manipla_; and from this these companies are even at the present\r\nday called _maniples_ in the Roman army. Now as Remus raised a revolt\r\nwithin, while Romulus assailed the palace without, the despot was\r\ncaptured and put to death without having been able to do anything, or\r\ntake any measures for his own safety.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the above story is told by Fabius Pictor and Diokles\r\nof Peparethos, who seem to have been the first historians of the\r\nfoundation of Rome. The story is doubted by many on account of its\r\ntheatrical and artificial form, yet we ought not to disbelieve it when\r\nwe consider what wondrous works are wrought by chance, and when, too, we\r\nreflect on the Roman Empire, which, had it not had a divine origin,\r\nnever could have arrived at its present extent.\r\n\r\nIX. After the death of Amulius, and the reorganisation of the kingdom,\r\nthe twins, who would not live in Alba as subjects, and did not wish to\r\nreign there during the life of their grandfather, gave up the sovereign\r\npower to him, and, having made a suitable provision for their mother,\r\ndetermined to dwell by themselves, and to found a city in the parts in\r\nwhich they themselves had been reared; at least, this is the most\r\nprobable of the various reasons which are given. It may also have been\r\nnecessary, as many slaves and fugitives had gathered round them, either\r\nthat they should disperse these men and so lose their entire power, or\r\nelse go and dwell alone amongst them. It is clear, from the rape of the\r\nSabine women, that the citizens of Alba would not admit these outcasts\r\ninto their own body, since that deed was caused, not by wanton\r\ninsolence, but by necessity, as they could not obtain wives by fair\r\nmeans; for after carrying the women off they treated them with the\r\ngreatest respect. Afterwards, when the city was once founded, they made\r\nit a sanctuary for people in distress to take refuge in, saying that it\r\nbelonged to the god Asylus; and they received in it all sorts of\r\npersons, not giving up slaves to their masters, debtors to their\r\ncreditors, or murderers to their judges, but saying that, in accordance\r\nwith a Pythian oracle, the sanctuary was free to all; so that the city\r\nsoon became full of men, for they say that at first it contained no less\r\nthan a thousand hearths. Of this more hereafter. When they were\r\nproceeding to found the city, they at once quarrelled about its site.\r\nRomulus fixed upon what is now called Roma Quadrata, a square piece of\r\nground, and wished the city to be built in that place; but Remus\r\npreferred a strong position on Mount Aventino, which, in memory of him,\r\nwas called the Remonium, and now is called Rignarium.\r\n\r\nThey agreed to decide their dispute by watching the flight of birds, and\r\nhaving taken their seats apart, it is said that six vultures appeared to\r\nRemus, and afterwards twice as many to Romulus. Some say that Remus\r\nreally saw his vultures, but that Romulus only pretended to have seen\r\nthem, and when Remus came to him, then the twelve appeared to Romulus;\r\nfor which reason the Romans at the present day draw their auguries\r\nespecially from vultures. Herodorus of Pontus says that Hercules\r\ndelighted in the sight of a vulture, when about to do any great action.\r\nIt is the most harmless of all creatures, for it injures neither crops,\r\nfruit, nor cattle, and lives entirely upon dead corpses. It does not\r\nkill or injure anything that has life, and even abstains from dead birds\r\nfrom its relationship to them. Now eagles, and owls, and falcons, peck\r\nand kill other birds, in spite of Aeschylus's line,\r\n\r\n    \"Bird-eating bird polluted e'er must be.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, the other birds are, so to speak, ever before our eyes, and\r\ncontinually remind us of their presence; but the vulture is seldom seen,\r\nand it is difficult to meet with its young, which has suggested to some\r\npersons the strange idea that vultures come from some other world to pay\r\nus their rare visits, which are like those occurrences which, according\r\nto the soothsayers, do not happen naturally or spontaneously, but by the\r\ninterposition of Heaven.\r\n\r\nX. When Remus discovered the deceit he was very angry, and, while\r\nRomulus was digging a trench round where the city wall was to be built,\r\nhe jeered at the works, and hindered them. At last, as he jumped over\r\nit, he was struck dead either by Romulus himself, or by Celer, one of\r\nhis companions. In this fight, Faustulus was slain, and also Pleistinus,\r\nwho is said to have been Faustulus's brother and to have helped him in\r\nrearing Romulus and his brother. Celer retired into Tyrrhenia, and from\r\nhim the Romans call quick sharp men _Celeres_; Quintus Metellus, who,\r\nwhen his father died, in a very few days exhibited a show of gladiators,\r\nwas surnamed Celer by the Romans in their wonder at the short time he\r\nhad spent in his preparations.\r\n\r\nXI. Romulus, after burying Remus and his foster-parents in the Remurium,\r\nconsecrated his city, having fetched men from Etruria, who taught him\r\nhow to perform it according to sacred rites and ceremonies, as though\r\nthey were celebrating holy mysteries. A trench was dug in a circle round\r\nwhat is now the Comitium, and into it were flung first-fruits of all\r\nthose things which are honourable and necessary for men. Finally each\r\nman brought a little of the earth of the country from which he came, and\r\nflung it into one heap and mixed it all together. They call this pit by\r\nthe same name as the heavens, _Mundus_. Next, they drew the outline of\r\nthe city in the form of a circle, with this place as its centre. And\r\nthen the founder, having fitted a plough with a brazen ploughshare, and\r\nyoked to it a bull and a cow, himself ploughs a deep furrow round the\r\nboundaries. It is the duty of his attendants to throw the clods inwards,\r\nwhich the plough turns up, and to let none of them fall outwards. By\r\nthis line they define the extent of the fortifications, and it is called\r\nby contraction, Pomoerium, which means behind the walls or beyond the\r\nwalls (_post moenia_). Wherever they intend to place a gate they take\r\noff the ploughshare, and carry the plough over, leaving a space. After\r\nthis ceremony they consider the entire wall sacred, except the gates;\r\nbut if they were sacred also, they could not without scruple bring in\r\nand out necessaries and unclean things through them.\r\n\r\nXII. It is agreed that the foundation of the city took place on the\r\neleventh day before the Kalends of May (the 21st of April). And on this\r\nday the Romans keep a festival which they call the birthday of the city.\r\nAt this feast, originally, we are told, they sacrificed nothing that has\r\nlife, but thought it right to keep the anniversary of the birth of the\r\ncity pure and unpolluted by blood. However, before the foundation of the\r\ncity, they used to keep a pastoral feast called Palilia. The Roman\r\nmonths at the present day do not in any way correspond to those of\r\nGreece; yet they (the Greeks) distinctly affirm that the day upon which\r\nRomulus founded the city was the 30th of the month. The Greeks likewise\r\ntell us that on that day an eclipse of the sun took place, which they\r\nthink was that observed by Antimachus of Teos, the epic poet, which\r\noccurred in the third year of the sixth Olympiad. In the time of Varro\r\nthe philosopher, who of all the Romans was most deeply versed in Roman\r\nhistory, there was one Taroutius, a companion of his, a philosopher and\r\nmathematician, who had especially devoted himself to the art of casting\r\nnativities, and was thought to have attained great skill therein. To\r\nthis man Varro proposed the task of finding the day and hour of\r\nRomulus's birth, basing his calculations on the influence which the\r\nstars were said to have had upon his life, just as geometricians solve\r\ntheir problems by the analytic method; for it belongs, he argued, to the\r\nsame science to predict the life of a man from the time of his birth,\r\nand to find the date of a man's birth if the incidents of his life are\r\ngiven. Taroutius performed his task, and after considering the things\r\ndone and suffered by Romulus, the length of his life, the manner of his\r\ndeath, and all such like matters, he confidently and boldly asserted\r\nthat Romulus was conceived by his mother in the first year of the second\r\nOlympiad, at the third hour of the twenty-third day of the month which\r\nis called in the Egyptian calendar _Choiac_, at which time there was a\r\ntotal eclipse of the sun. He stated that he was born on the twenty-first\r\nday of the month _Thouth_, about sunrise. Rome was founded by him on the\r\nninth day of the month _Pharmouthi_, between the second and third hour;\r\nfor it is supposed that the fortunes of cities, as well as those of men,\r\nhave their certain periods which can be discovered by the position of\r\nthe stars at their nativities. The quaint subtlety of these speculations\r\nmay perhaps amuse the reader more than their legendary character will\r\nweary him.\r\n\r\nXIII. When the city was founded, Romulus first divided all the\r\nable-bodied males into regiments, each consisting of three thousand\r\ninfantry and three hundred cavalry. These were named legions, because\r\nthey consisted of men of military age selected from the population. The\r\nrest of the people were now organised. They were called Populus, and a\r\nhundred of the noblest were chosen from among them and formed into a\r\ncouncil. These he called Patricians, and their assembly the Senate. This\r\nword Senate clearly means assembly of old men; and the members of it\r\nwere named Patricians, according to some, because they were the fathers\r\nof legitimate offspring; according to others, because they were able to\r\ngive an account of who their own fathers were, which few of the first\r\ncolonists were able to do. Others say that it was from their\r\n_Patrocinium_, as they then called, and do at the present day call,\r\ntheir patronage of their clients. There is a legend that this word arose\r\nfrom one Patron, a companion of Evander, who was kind and helpful to his\r\ninferiors. But it is most reasonable to suppose that Romulus called them\r\nby this name because he intended the most powerful men to show kindness\r\nto their inferiors, and to show the poorer classes that they ought not\r\nto fear the great nor grudge them their honours, but be on friendly\r\nterms with them, thinking of them and addressing them as fathers\r\n(Patres). For, up to the present day, foreigners address the senators as\r\nLords, but the Romans call them Conscript Fathers, using the most\r\nhonourable and least offensive of their titles. Originally they were\r\nmerely called the Fathers, but afterwards, as more were enrolled, they\r\nwere called Conscript Fathers. By this more dignified title Romulus\r\ndistinguished the Senate from the People; and he introduced another\r\ndistinction between the powerful and the common people by naming the\r\nformer patrons, which means defenders, and the latter clients, which\r\nmeans dependants. By this means he implanted in them a mutual good\r\nfeeling which was the source of great benefits, for the patrons acted as\r\nadvocates for their clients in law suits, and in all cases became their\r\nadvisers and friends, while the clients not only respected their patrons\r\nbut even assisted them, when they were poor, to portion their daughters\r\nor pay their creditors. No law or magistrate could compel a patron to\r\nbear witness against his client, nor a client against his patron.\r\nMoreover, in later times, although all their other rights remained\r\nunimpaired, it was thought disgraceful for a patron to receive money\r\nfrom a client. So much for these matters.\r\n\r\nXIV. In the fourth month after the city was founded, we are told by\r\nFabius, the reckless deed of carrying off the women took place. Some say\r\nthat Romulus himself naturally loved war, and, being persuaded by some\r\nprophecies that Rome was fated to grow by wars and so reach the greatest\r\nprosperity, attacked the Sabines without provocation; for he did not\r\ncarry off many maidens, but only thirty, as though it was war that he\r\ndesired more than wives for his followers. This is not probable: Romulus\r\nsaw that his city was newly-filled with colonists, few of whom had\r\nwives, while most of them were a mixed multitude of poor or unknown\r\norigin, who were despised by the neighouring states, and expected by\r\nthem shortly to fall to pieces. He intended his violence to lead to an\r\nalliance with the Sabines, as soon as the damsels became reconciled to\r\ntheir lot, and set about it as follows: First he circulated a rumour\r\nthat the altar of some god had been discovered, hidden in the earth.\r\nThis god was called Census, either because he was the god of counsel\r\n(for the Romans to this day call their assembly _Concilium_, and their\r\nchief magistrates _consuls_, as it were those who take counsel on behalf\r\nof the people), or else it was the equestrian Neptune. The altar stands\r\nin the greater hippodrome, and is kept concealed except during the\r\nhorse-races, when it is uncovered. Some say that, as the whole plot was\r\ndark and mysterious, it was natural that the god's altar should be\r\nunderground. When it was brought out, he proclaimed a splendid sacrifice\r\nin its honour, and games and shows open to all men. Many people\r\nassembled to see them, and Romulus sat among his nobles, dressed in a\r\npurple robe. The signal for the assault was that he should rise, unfold\r\nhis cloak, and then again wrap it around him. Many men armed with swords\r\nstood round him, and at the signal they drew their swords, rushed\r\nforward with a shout, and snatched up the daughters of the Sabines, but\r\nallowed the others to escape unharmed. Some say that only thirty were\r\ncarried off, from whom the thirty tribes were named, but Valerius of\r\nAntium says five hundred and twenty-seven, and Juba six hundred and\r\neighty-three, all maidens. This is the best apology for Romulus; for\r\nthey only carried off one married woman, Hersilia, which proved that it\r\nwas not through insolence or wickedness that they carried them off, but\r\nwith the intention of forcibly effecting a union between the two races.\r\nSome say that Hersilia married Hostilius, one of the noblest Romans,\r\nothers that she married Romulus himself, and that he had children by\r\nher; one daughter, called Prima from her being the first-born, and one\r\nson, whom his father originally named Aollius, because of the assembling\r\nof the citizens, but whom they afterwards named Avillius. This is the\r\nstory as told by Zenodotus of Troezen, but many contradict it.\r\n\r\nXV. Among the ravishers they say there were some men of low condition\r\nwho had seized a remarkably tall and beautiful maiden. When any of the\r\nnobles met them and endeavoured to take her away from them, they cried\r\nout that they were taking her to Talasius, a young man of good family\r\nand reputation. Hearing this, all agreed and applauded, and some even\r\nturned and accompanied them, crying out the name of Talasius through\r\ntheir friendship for him. From this circumstance the Romans up to the\r\npresent day call upon Talasius in their marriage-songs, as the Greeks do\r\nupon Hymen; for Talasius is said to have been fortunate in his wife.\r\nSextius Sulla of Carthage, a man neither deficient in learning or taste,\r\ntold me that this word was given by Romulus as the signal for the rape,\r\nand so that all those who carried off maidens cried \"Talasio.\" But most\r\nauthors, among whom is Juba, think that it is used to encourage brides\r\nto industry and spinning wool (talasia), as at that time Greek words\r\nhad not been overpowered by Latin ones. But if this be true, and the\r\nRomans at that time really used this word \"talasia\" for wool-spinning,\r\nas we do, we might make another more plausible conjecture about it. When\r\nthe treaty of peace was arranged between the Romans and the Sabines, a\r\nspecial provision was made about the women, that they were to do no work\r\nfor the men except wool-spinning. And thus the custom remained for the\r\nfriends of those who were married afterwards to call upon Talasius in\r\njest, meaning to testify that the bride was to do no other work than\r\nspinning. To the present day the custom remains in force that the bride\r\nmust not step over the threshold into her house, but be lifted over it\r\nand carried in, because the Sabine maidens were carried in forcibly, and\r\ndid not walk in.\r\n\r\nSome add that the parting of the bride's hair with the point of a spear\r\nis done in memory of the first Roman marriage having been effected by\r\nwar and battle; on which subject we have enlarged further in our\r\ntreatise on Causes.\r\n\r\nThe rape of the Sabines took place upon the eighteenth day of the month\r\nSextilis, which is now called August, on which day the feast of the\r\nConsualia is kept.\r\n\r\nXVI. The Sabines were a numerous and warlike tribe, dwelling in unwalled\r\nvillages, as though it was their birthright as a Lacedaemonian colony to\r\nbe brave and fearless. Yet when they found themselves bound by such\r\nhostages to keep the peace, and in fear for their daughters, they sent\r\nan embassy to propose equitable and moderate terms, that Romulus should\r\ngive back their daughters to them, and disavow the violence which had\r\nbeen used, and that afterwards the two nations should live together in\r\namity and concord. But when Romulus refused to deliver up the maidens,\r\nbut invited the Sabines to accept his alliance, while the other tribes\r\nwere hesitating and considering what was to be done, Acron, the king of\r\nthe Ceninetes, a man of spirit and renown in the wars, who had viewed\r\nRomulus first proceeding in founding a city with suspicion, now, after\r\nwhat he had done in carrying off the women, declared that he was\r\nbecoming dangerous, and would not be endurable unless he were\r\nchastised. He at once began the war, and marched with a great force; and\r\nRomulus marched to meet him. When they came in sight of each other they\r\neach challenged the other to fight, the soldiers on both sides looking\r\non. Romulus made a vow that if he should overcome and kill his enemy he\r\nwould himself carry his spoils to the temple of Jupiter and offer them\r\nto him. He overcame his adversary, and slew him, routed his army and\r\ncaptured his city. He did not harm the inhabitants, except that he\r\nordered them to demolish their houses and follow him to Rome, to become\r\ncitizens on equal terms with the rest. This is the policy by which Rome\r\ngrew so great, namely that of absorbing conquered nations into herself\r\non terms of equality.\r\n\r\nRomulus, in order to make the fulfilment of his vow as pleasing to\r\nJupiter, and as fine a spectacle for the citizens as he could, cut down\r\na tall oak-tree at his camp, and fashioned it into a trophy,[A] upon\r\nwhich he hung or fastened all the arms of Acron, each in its proper\r\nplace. Then he girded on his own clothes, placed a crown of laurel upon\r\nhis long hair, and, placing the trophy upright on his right shoulder,\r\nmarched along in his armour, singing a paean of victory, with all the\r\narmy following him. At Rome the citizens received him with admiration\r\nand delight; and this procession was the origin of all the subsequent\r\ntriumphs and the model which they imitated. The trophy itself was called\r\nan offering to Jupiter Feretrius; for the Romans call to strike,\r\n_ferire_, and Romulus prayed that he might strike down his enemy. The\r\nspoils were called _spolia opima_, according to Varro, because _opim_\r\nmeans excellence. A more plausible interpretation would be from the\r\ndeed itself, for work is called in Latin _opus_. This dedication of\r\n_spolia opima_ is reserved as a privilege for a general who has slain\r\nthe opposing general with his own hand. It has only been enjoyed by\r\nthree Roman generals, first by Romulus, who slew Acron, king of the\r\nCeninetes, second by Cornelius Cossus, who slew the Tyrrhenian\r\nTolumnius, and, above all, by Claudius Marcellus, who killed Britomart,\r\nthe king of the Gauls. Now Cossus and Marcellus drove into the city in\r\nchariots and four, carrying the trophies in their own hands; but\r\nDionysius is in error when he says that Romulus used a chariot and four,\r\nfor the historians tell us that Tarquinius, the son of Demaratus, was\r\nthe first of the kings who introduced this pomp into his triumphs.\r\nOthers say that Poplicola was the first to triumph in a chariot.\r\nHowever, the statues of Romulus bearing the trophy, which are to be seen\r\nin Rome, are all on foot.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The habit of erecting trophies on a field of battle in\r\ntoken of victory appears to have been originally confined to the Greeks,\r\nwho usually, as in the text, lopped the branches off a tree, placed it\r\nin the ground in some conspicuous place, and hung upon it the shields\r\nand other spoils taken from the enemy. In later times the Romans adopted\r\nthe habit of commemorating a victory by erecting some building on the\r\nfield of battle. Under the emperors, victory was commemorated by a\r\ntriumphal arch at Rome, many of which now exist. The Greek trophies were\r\nalways formed of perishable materials, and it was contrary to their\r\ncustom to repair them, that they might not perpetuate national\r\nenmities.]\r\n\r\nXVII. After the capture of the Ceninete tribe, while the rest of the\r\nSabines were still engaged in preparation for war, the inhabitants of\r\nFidenae and Crustumerium and Antemna attacked the Romans. A battle took\r\nplace in which they were all alike worsted, after which they permitted\r\nRomulus to take their cities, divide their lands, and incorporate them\r\nas citizens. Romulus divided all the lands among the citizens, except\r\nthat which was held by the fathers of any of the maidens who had been\r\ncarried off, which he allowed them to retain.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the Sabines, angry at these successes, chose Tatius as\r\ntheir general and marched against Rome. The city was hard to attack, as\r\nthe Capitol stood as an advanced fort to defend it. Here was placed a\r\ngarrison, and Tarpeius was its commander, not the maiden Tarpeia, as\r\nsome write, who make out Romulus a fool; but it was this Tarpeia, the\r\ndaughter of the captain of the garrison, who betrayed the capital to the\r\nSabines, for the sake of the golden bracelets which she saw them\r\nwearing. She asked as the price of her treachery that they should give\r\nher what they wore on their left arms. After making an agreement with\r\nTatius, she opened a gate at night and let in the Sabines. Now it\r\nappears that Antigonus was not singular when he said that he loved men\r\nwhen they were betraying, but hated them after they had betrayed; as\r\nalso Caesar said, in the case of Rhymitalkes the Thracian, that he loved\r\nthe treachery but hated the traitor; but this seems a common reflection\r\nabout bad men by those who have need of them, just as we need the poison\r\nof certain venomous beasts; for they appreciate their value while they\r\nare making use of them, and loathe their wickedness when they have done\r\nwith them. And that was how Tarpeia was treated by Tatius. He ordered\r\nthe Sabines to remember their agreement, and not to grudge her what was\r\non their left arms. He himself first of all took off his gold armlet,\r\nand with it flung his great oblong shield. As all the rest did the like,\r\nshe perished, being pelted with the gold bracelets and crushed by the\r\nnumber and weight of the shields. Tarpeius also was convicted of\r\ntreachery by Romulus, according to Juba's version of the history of\r\nSulpicius Galba. The other legends about Tarpeia are improbable; amongst\r\nthem that which is told by Antigonus, that she was the daughter of\r\nTatius the Sabine leader, abducted by Romulus, and treated by her father\r\nas is related above. Simylus the poet talks utter nonsense when he says\r\nthat it was not the Sabines but the Gauls to whom Tarpeia betrayed the\r\nCapitol, because she was in love with their king. His verses run as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    \"And near Tarpeia, by the Capitol\r\n      That dwelt, betrayer of the walls of Rome.\r\n    She loved the chieftain of the Gauls too well,\r\n      To guard from treachery her father's home.\"\r\n\r\nAnd a little afterwards he speaks of her death.\r\n\r\n    \"Her did the Boians and the Celtic tribes\r\n      Bury, but not beside the stream of Po;\r\n    From off their warlike arms their shields they flung,\r\n      And what the damsel longed for laid her low.\"\r\n\r\nXVIII. However, as Tarpeia was buried there, the hill was called the\r\nTarpeian hill until King Tarquinius, when he dedicated the place to\r\nJupiter, removed her remains and abolished the name of Tarpeia. But even\r\nto this day they call the rock in the Capitol the Tarpeian Rock, down\r\nwhich malefactors used to be flung. When the Sabines held the citadel,\r\nRomulus in fury challenged them to come down and fight. Tatius accepted\r\nhis challenge with confidence, as he saw that if overpowered his men\r\nwould have a strong place of refuge to retreat to. All the intermediate\r\nspace, in which they were about to engage, was surrounded by hills, and\r\nso seemed to make a desperate battle necessary, as there were but narrow\r\noutlets for flight or pursuit. It chanced, also, that the river had been\r\nin flood a few days before, and had left a deep muddy pool of water upon\r\nthe level ground where the Forum now stands; so that men's footing was\r\nnot certain, but difficult and treacherous. Here a piece of good fortune\r\nbefell the Sabines as they heedlessly pressed forward. Curtius, one of\r\ntheir chiefs, a man with a reputation for dashing courage, rode on\r\nhorseback far before the rest. His horse plunged into this morass, and\r\nhe, after trying to extricate him, at last finding it impossible, left\r\nhim there and saved himself. This place, in memory of him, is still\r\ncalled the Gulf of Curtius. Warned of their danger, the Sabines fought a\r\nstout and indecisive battle, in which many fell, amongst them Hostilius.\r\nHe is said to have been the husband of Hersilia and the grandfather of\r\nHostilius, who became king after the reign of Numa. Many combats took\r\nplace in that narrow space, as we may suppose; and especial mention is\r\nmade of one, which proved the last, in which Romulus was struck on the\r\nhead by a stone and like to fall, and unable to fight longer. The Romans\r\nnow gave way to the Sabines, and fled to the Palatine hill, abandoning\r\nthe level ground. Romulus, now recovered from the blow, endeavoured to\r\nstay the fugitives, and with loud shouts called upon them to stand firm\r\nand fight. But as the stream of fugitives poured on, and no one had the\r\ncourage to face round, he lifted his hands to heaven and prayed to\r\nJupiter to stay the army and not to allow the tottering state of Rome to\r\nfall, but to help it. After his prayer many were held back from flight\r\nby reverence for the king, and the fugitives suddenly resumed their\r\nconfidence. They made their first stand where now is the temple of\r\nJupiter Stator, which one may translate \"He who makes to stand firm;\"\r\nand then forming their ranks once more they drove back the Sabines as\r\nfar as what is now called the Palace, and the Temple of Vesta.\r\n\r\nXIX. While they were preparing to fight as though the battle was only\r\nnow just begun, they were restrained by a strange spectacle, beyond the\r\npower of words to express. The daughters of the Sabines who had been\r\ncarried off were seen rushing from all quarters, with loud shrieks and\r\nwailings, through the ranks and among the dead bodies, as though\r\npossessed by some god. Some of them carried infant children in their\r\narms, and others wore their hair loose and dishevelled. All of them kept\r\naddressing the Romans and the Sabines alternately by the most endearing\r\nnames. The hearts of both armies were melted, and they fell back so as\r\nto leave a space for the women between them. A murmur of sorrow ran\r\nthrough all the ranks, and a strong feeling of pity was excited by the\r\nsight of the women, and by their words, which began with arguments and\r\nupbraidings, but ended in entreaties and tears. \"What wrong have we done\r\nto you,\" said they, \"that we should have suffered and should even now\r\nsuffer such cruel treatment at your hands? We were violently and\r\nwrongfully torn away from our friends, and after we had been carried off\r\nwe were neglected by our brothers, fathers, and relatives for so long a\r\ntime, that now, bound by the closest of ties to our enemies, we tremble\r\nfor our ravishers and wrongers when they fight, and weep when they fall.\r\nYe would not come and tear us from our ravishers while we were yet\r\nmaidens, but now ye would separate wives from their husbands, and\r\nmothers from their children, a worse piece of service to us than your\r\nformer neglect. Even if it was not about us that you began to fight, you\r\nought to cease now that you have become fathers-in-law, and\r\ngrandfathers, and relatives one of another. But if the war is about us,\r\nthen carry us off with your sons-in-law and our children, and give us\r\nour fathers and relatives, but do not take our husbands and children\r\nfrom us. We beseech you not to allow us to be carried off captive a\r\nsecond time.\" Hersilia spoke at length in this fashion, and as the other\r\nwomen added their entreaties to hers, a truce was agreed upon, and the\r\nchiefs met in conference. Hereupon the women made their husbands and\r\nchildren known to their fathers and brothers, fetched food and drink for\r\nsuch as needed it, and took the wounded into their own houses to be\r\nattended to there. Thus they let their friends see that they were\r\nmistresses of their own houses, and that their husbands attended to\r\ntheir wishes and treated them with every respect.\r\n\r\nIn the conference it was accordingly determined that such women as chose\r\nto do so should continue to live with their husbands, free, as we have\r\nalready related, from all work and duties except that of spinning wool\r\n(_talasia_); that the Romans and the Sabines should dwell together in\r\nthe city, and that the city should be called Rome, after Romulus, but\r\nthe Romans be called Quirites after the native city of Tatius; and that\r\nthey should both reign and command the army together. The place where\r\nthis compact was made is even to this day called the Comitium, for the\r\nRomans call meeting _coire_.\r\n\r\nXX. Now that the city was doubled in numbers, a hundred more senators\r\nwere elected from among the Sabines, and the legions were composed of\r\nsix thousand infantry and six hundred cavalry. They also established\r\nthree tribes, of which they named one Rhamnenses, from Romulus, another\r\nTitienses from Tatius, and the third Lucerenses, after the name of a\r\ngrove to which many had fled for refuge, requiring asylum, and had been\r\nadmitted as citizens. They call a grove _lucus_. The very name of\r\n_tribe_ and tribune show that there were three tribes. Each tribe was\r\ndivided into ten _centuries_, which some say were named after the women\r\nwho were carried off; but this seems to be untrue, as many of them are\r\nnamed after places. However, many privileges were conferred upon the\r\nwomen, amongst which were that men should make way for them when they\r\nwalked out, to say nothing disgraceful in their presence, or appear\r\nnaked before them, on pain of being tried before the criminal court; and\r\nalso that their children should wear the _bulla_, which is so called\r\nfrom its shape, which is like a bubble, and was worn round the neck, and\r\nalso the broad purple border of their robe (_praetexta_).\r\n\r\nThe kings did not conduct their deliberations together, but each first\r\ntook counsel with his own hundred senators, and then they all met\r\ntogether. Tatius dwelt where now is the temple of Juno Moneta, and\r\nRomulus by the steps of the Fair Shore, as it is called, which are at\r\nthe descent from the Palatine hill into the great Circus. Here they say\r\nthe sacred cornel-tree grew, the legend being that Romulus, to try his\r\nstrength, threw a spear, with cornel-wood shaft, from Mount Aventine,\r\nand when the spear-head sunk into the ground, though many tried, no one\r\nwas able to pull it out. The soil, which was fertile, suited the wood,\r\nand it budded, and became the stem of a good-sized cornel-tree. After\r\nthe death of Romulus this was preserved and reverenced as one of the\r\nholiest objects in the city. A wall was built round it, and whenever any\r\none thought that it looked inclined to droop and wither he at once\r\nraised a shout to tell the bystanders, and they, just as if they were\r\nassisting to put out a fire, called for water, and came from all\r\nquarters carrying pots of water to the place. It is said that when Gaius\r\nCaesar repaired the steps, and the workmen were digging near it, they\r\nunintentionally damaged the roots, and the tree died.\r\n\r\nXXI. The Sabines adopted the Roman system of months, and all that is\r\nremarkable about them will be found in the 'Life of Numa.' But Romulus\r\nadopted the large oblong Sabine shield, and gave up the round Argolic\r\nshields which he and the Romans had formerly carried. The two nations\r\nshared each other's festivals, not abolishing any which either had been\r\nwont to celebrate, but introducing several new ones, among which are the\r\nMatronalia, instituted in honour of the women at the end of the war, and\r\nthat of the Carmentalia. It is thought by some that Carmenta is the\r\nruling destiny which presides over a man's birth, wherefore she is\r\nworshipped by mothers. Others say that she was the wife of Evander the\r\nArcadian, a prophetess who used to chant oracles in verse, and hence\r\nsurnamed Carmenta (for the Romans call verses _carmina_); whereas it is\r\ngenerally admitted that her right name was Nicostrate. Some explain the\r\nname of Carmenta more plausibly as meaning that during her prophetic\r\nfrenzy she was bereft of intellect; for the Romans call to lack,\r\n_carcre_; and mind, _mentem_.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken before of the feast of the Palilia. That of the\r\nLupercalia would seem, from the time of its celebration, to be a\r\nceremony of purification; for it is held during the ominous days of\r\nFebruary, a month whose name one might translate by Purification; and\r\nthat particular day was originally called Febraté. The name of this\r\nfeast in Greek signifies that of wolves, and it is thought, on this\r\naccount, to be very ancient, and derived from the Arcadians who came to\r\nItaly with Evander. Still this is an open question, for the name may\r\nhave arisen from the she-wolf, as we see that the Luperci start to run\r\ntheir course from the place where Romulus is said to have been exposed.\r\nThe circumstances of the ritual are such as to make it hard to\r\nconjecture their meaning. They slaughter goats, and then two youths of\r\ngood family are brought to them. Then some with a bloody knife mark the\r\nforeheads of the youths, and others at once wipe the blood away with\r\nwool dipped in milk. The youths are expected to laugh when it is wiped\r\naway. After this they cut the skins of the goats into strips and run\r\nabout naked, except a girdle round the middle, striking with the thongs\r\nall whom they meet. Women in the prime of life do not avoid being\r\nstruck, as they believe that it assists them in childbirth and promotes\r\nfertility. It is also a peculiarity of this festival that the Luperci\r\nsacrifice a dog. One Bontes, who wrote an elegiac poem on the origin of\r\nthe Roman myths, says that when Romulus and his party had killed\r\nAmulius, they ran back in their joy to the place where the she-wolf\r\nsuckled them when little, and that the feast is typical of this, and\r\nthat the young nobles run,\r\n\r\n    \"As, smiting all they met, that day\r\n    From Alba Romulus and Remus ran.\"\r\n\r\nThe bloody sword is placed upon their foreheads in token of the danger\r\nand slaughter of that day, and the wiping with the milk is in\r\nremembrance of their nurse. Caius Acilius tells us that, before the\r\nfoundation of Rome, the cattle of Romulus and Remus were missing, and\r\nthey, after invoking Faunus, ran out to search for them, naked, that\r\nthey might not be inconvenienced by sweat; and that this is the reason\r\nthat the Luperci ran about naked. As for the dog, one would say that if\r\nthe sacrifice is purificatory, it is sacrificed on behalf of those who\r\nuse it. The Greeks, in their purificatory rites, sacrifice dogs, and\r\noften make use of what is called Periskylakismos. But if this feast be\r\nin honour of the she-wolf, in gratitude for her suckling and preserving\r\nof Romulus, then it is very natural to sacrifice a dog, for it is an\r\nenemy of wolves; unless, indeed, the beast is put to death to punish it\r\nfor hindering the Luperci when they ran their course.\r\n\r\nXXII. It is said also that Romulus instituted the service of the sacred\r\nfire of Vestae, and the holy virgins who keep it up, called Vestals.\r\nOthers attribute this to Numa, though they say that Romulus was a very\r\nreligious prince, and learned in divination, for which purpose he used\r\nto carry the crooked staff called _lituus_, with which to divide the\r\nheavens into spaces for the observation of the flight of birds. This,\r\nwhich is preserved in the Palatium, was lost when the city was taken by\r\nthe Gauls; but afterwards, when the barbarians had been repulsed, it was\r\nfound unharmed in a deep bed of ashes, where everything else had been\r\nburned or spoiled. He also enacted some laws, the most arbitrary of\r\nwhich is that a wife cannot obtain a divorce from her husband, but that\r\na husband may put away his wife for poisoning her children,\r\ncounterfeiting keys, or adultery. If any one put away his wife on other\r\ngrounds than these, he enacted that half his property should go to his\r\nwife, and half to the temple of Ceres. A man who divorced his wife was\r\nto make an offering to the Chthonian gods.[A] A peculiarity of his\r\nlegislation is that, while he laid down no course of procedure in case\r\nof parricide, he speaks of all murder by the name of parricide, as\r\nthough the one were an abominable, but the other an impossible crime.\r\nAnd for many years it appeared that he had rightly judged, for no one\r\nattempted anything of the kind at Rome for nearly six hundred years; but\r\nit is said that the first parricide was that of Lucius Hostilius, which\r\nhe committed after the war with Hannibal. Enough has now been said upon\r\nthese subjects.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Chthonian gods are the gods of the world below.]\r\n\r\nXXIII. In the fifth year of the reign of Tatius, some of his relatives\r\nfell in with ambassadors from Laurentum, on their way to Rome, and\r\nendeavoured to rob them. As the ambassadors would not submit to this,\r\nbut defended themselves, they slew them. Romulus at once gave it as his\r\nopinion that the authors of this great and audacious crime ought to be\r\npunished, but Tatius hushed the matter up, and enabled them to escape.\r\nThis is said to have been the only occasion upon which they were openly\r\nat variance, for in all other matters they acted with the greatest\r\npossible unanimity. The relatives, however, of the murdered men, as they\r\nwere hindered by Tatius from receiving any satisfaction, fell upon him\r\nwhen he and Romulus were offering sacrifice at Lavinium, and slew him,\r\nbut respected Romulus, and praised him as a just man. He brought home\r\nthe body of Tatius, and buried it honourably. It lies near what is\r\ncalled the _Armilustrium_, on Mount Aventine.\r\n\r\nBut Romulus neglected altogether to exact any satisfaction for the\r\nmurder. Some writers say that the city of Lavinium, in its terror,\r\ndelivered up the murderers of Tatius, but that Romulus allowed them to\r\ndepart, saying that blood had been atoned for by blood. This speech of\r\nhis gave rise to some suspicion that he was not displeased at being rid\r\nof his colleague. However, it caused no disturbance in the state, and\r\ndid not move the Sabines to revolt, but partly out of regard for\r\nRomulus, and fear of his power, and belief in his divine mission, they\r\ncontinued to live under his rule with cheerfulness and respect. Many\r\nforeign tribes also respected Romulus, and the more ancient Latin races\r\nsent him ambassadors, and made treaties of friendship and alliance.\r\n\r\nHe took Fidenae, a city close to Rome, according to some authorities, by\r\nsending his cavalry thither on a sudden, and ordering them to cut the\r\npivots of the city gates, and then unexpectedly appearing in person.\r\nOthers say that the people of Fidenae first invaded the Roman territory,\r\ndrove off plunder from it, and insulted the neighbourhood of the city\r\nitself, and that Romulus laid an ambush for them, slew many, and took\r\ntheir city. He did not destroy it, but made it a Roman colony, and sent\r\ntwo thousand five hundred Romans thither as colonists on the Ides of\r\nApril.\r\n\r\nXXIV. After this a pestilence fell upon Rome, which slew men suddenly\r\nwithout previous sickness, and afflicted the crops and cattle with\r\nbarrenness. A shower of blood also fell in the city, so that religious\r\nterror was added to the people's sufferings. As a similar visitation\r\nbefell the citizens of Laurentum, it became evident that the wrath of\r\nthe gods was visiting these cities because of the unavenged murders of\r\nTatius and of the ambassadors. The guilty parties were delivered up on\r\nboth sides, and duly punished, after which the plague was sensibly\r\nmitigated. Romulus also purified the city with lustrations, which, they\r\nsay, are even now practised at the Ferentine gate. But before the plague\r\nceased, the people of Camerium attacked the Romans, supposing that they\r\nwould be unable to defend themselves on account of their misfortune, and\r\noverran their country. Nevertheless, Romulus instantly marched against\r\nthem, slew six hundred of them in battle, and took their city. Half the\r\nsurvivors he transplanted to Rome, and settled twice as many Romans as\r\nthe remainder at Camerium, on the Kalends of Sextilis. So many citizens\r\nhad he to spare after he had only inhabited Rome for about sixteen\r\nyears. Among the other spoils, he carried off a brazen four-horse\r\nchariot from Camerium; this he dedicated in the temple of Vulcan, having\r\nplaced in it a figure of himself being crowned by Victory.\r\n\r\nXXV. As the city was now so flourishing, the weaker of the neighbouring\r\nstates made submission, and were glad to receive assurance that they\r\nwould be unharmed; but the more powerful, fearing and envying Romulus,\r\nconsidered that they ought not to remain quiet, but ought to check the\r\ngrowth of Rome. First the Etruscans of Veii, a people possessed of wide\r\nlands and a large city, began the war by demanding the surrender to them\r\nof Fidenae, which they claimed as belonging to them. This demand was not\r\nonly unjust, but absurd, seeing that they had not assisted the people of\r\nFidenae when they were fighting and in danger, but permitted them to be\r\ndestroyed, and then demanded their houses and lands, when they were in\r\nthe possession of others. Receiving a haughty answer from Romulus, they\r\ndivided themselves into two bodies, with one of which they attacked\r\nFidenae, and with the other went to meet Romulus. At Fidenae they\r\nconquered the Romans, and slew two thousand; but they were defeated by\r\nRomulus, with a loss of eight thousand men. A second battle now took\r\nplace at Fidenae, in which all agree that Romulus took the most\r\nimportant part, showing the greatest skill and courage, and a strength\r\nand swiftness more than mortal. But some accounts are altogether\r\nfabulous, such as that fourteen hundred were slain, more than half of\r\nwhom Romulus slew with his own hand. The Messenians appear to use\r\nequally inflated language about Aristomenes, when they tell us that he\r\nthrice offered sacrifice for having slain a hundred Lacedaemonians.\r\nAfter the victory, Romulus did not pursue the beaten army, but marched\r\nstraight to the city of Veii. The citizens, after so great a disaster,\r\nmade no resistance, but at their own request were granted a treaty and\r\nalliance for a hundred years, giving up a large portion of their\r\nterritory, called the Septem Pagi, or seven districts, and their\r\nsaltworks by the river, and handing over fifty of their leading men as\r\nhostages.\r\n\r\nFor his success at Veii, Romulus enjoyed another triumph, on the Ides of\r\nOctober, when he led in his train many captives, amongst whom was the\r\nVeientine general, an old man, who was thought to have mismanaged\r\nmatters foolishly and like a boy. On this account to this day, when a\r\nsacrifice is made for victory, they lead an old man through the Forum\r\nand up to the Capitol, dressed in a boy's robe with wide purple border,\r\nand with a child's _bulla_ hung round his neck; and the herald calls out\r\n\"Sardinians for sale.\" For the Tyrrhenians or Tuscans are said to be of\r\nSardinian origin, and Veii is a Tyrrhenian city.\r\n\r\nXXVI. This was Romulus's last war. After it, he, like nearly all those\r\nwho have risen to power and fame by a great and unexpected series of\r\nsuccesses, became filled with self-confidence and arrogance, and, in\r\nplace of his former popular manners, assumed the offensive style of a\r\ndespot. He wore a purple tunic, and a toga with a purple border, and did\r\nbusiness reclining instead of sitting on a throne; and was always\r\nattended by the band of youths called Celeres, from their quickness in\r\nservice. Others walked before him with staves to keep off the crowd, and\r\nwere girt with thongs, with which to bind any one whom he might order\r\ninto custody. The Latins used formerly to call to bind _ligare_, and now\r\ncall it _alligare_; wherefore the staff-bearers are called _lictors_,\r\nand their staves are called _bacula_,[A] from the rods which they then\r\ncarried. It is probable that these officers now called _lictors_ by the\r\ninsertion of the _c_, were originally called _litors_, that is, in\r\nGreek, _leitourgoi_ (public officials). For to this day the Greeks call\r\na town-hall _leitus_, and the people _laos_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The Romans termed these bundles of rods _fasces_. The\r\nderivation of _lictor_ from the Greek shows the utter ignorance of\r\netymology prevailing among the ancients.]\r\n\r\nXXVII. When Romulus' grandfather Numitor died in Alba, although he was\r\nevidently his heir, yet through a desire for popularity he left his\r\nclaim unsettled, and contented himself with appointing a chief\r\nmagistrate for the people of Alba every year; thus teaching the Roman\r\nnobles to desire a freer constitution, which should not be so much\r\nencroached upon by the king. For at Rome now even the so-called Fathers\r\ntook no part in public affairs, but had merely their name and dignity,\r\nand were called into the Senate House more for form's sake than to\r\nexpress their opinions. When there, they listened in silence to\r\nRomulus's orders, and the only advantage which they possessed over the\r\ncommons was that they knew the king's mind sooner than they. Worst of\r\nall was, that he of his own authority divided the land which was\r\nobtained in war amongst the soldiers, and restored the hostages to the\r\nVeientines, against the will of the Senate and without consulting it, by\r\nwhich he seemed purposely to insult it. On this account the Senate was\r\nsuspected, when shortly after this he miraculously disappeared. His\r\ndisappearance took place on the Nones of the month now called July, but\r\nthen Quintilis, leaving nothing certain or agreed on about his end\r\nexcept the date. Even now things happen in the same fashion as then; and\r\nwe need not wonder at the uncertainty about the death of Romulus, when\r\nthat of Scipio Africanus, in his own house after supper, proved so\r\ninexplicable, some saying that it arose from an evil habit of body, some\r\nthat he had poisoned himself, some that his enemies had suffocated him\r\nduring the night. And yet the corpse of Scipio lay openly exposed for\r\nall to see, and gave all who saw it some ground for their conjectures;\r\nwhereas Romulus suddenly disappeared, and no morsel of his body or shred\r\nof his garments were ever seen again. Some supposed that the Senators\r\nfell upon him in the Temple of Vulcan, and, after killing him cut his\r\nbody in pieces and each of them carried off one in the folds of his\r\nrobe. Others think that his disappearance took place neither in the\r\nTemple of Vulcan, nor yet in the presence of the Senators alone, but say\r\nthat Romulus was holding an assembly without the city, near a place\r\ncalled the Goat's Marsh, when suddenly strange and wonderful things took\r\nplace in the heavens, and marvellous changes; for the sun's light was\r\nextinguished, and night fell, not calm and quiet, but with terrible\r\nthunderings, gusts of wind, and driving spray from all quarters.\r\nHereupon the people took to flight in confusion, but the nobles\r\ncollected together by themselves. When the storm was over, and the light\r\nreturned, the people returned to the place again, and searched in vain\r\nfor Romulus, but were told by the nobles not to trouble themselves to\r\nlook for him, but to pray to Romulus and reverence him, for he had been\r\ncaught up into heaven, and now would be a propitious god for them\r\ninstead of a good king.\r\n\r\nThe people believed this story, and went their way rejoicing, and\r\npraying to him with good hope; but there were some who discussed the\r\nwhole question in a harsh and unfriendly spirit, and blamed the nobles\r\nfor encouraging the people to such acts of folly when they themselves\r\nwere the murderers of the king.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. Now Julius Proculus, one of the noblest patricians, and of good\r\nreputation, being one of the original colonists from Alba, and a friend\r\nand companion of Romulus, came into the Forum, and there upon his oath,\r\nand touching the most sacred things, stated before all men that as he\r\nwas walking along the road Romulus appeared, meeting him, more beautiful\r\nand taller than he had ever appeared before, with bright and glittering\r\narms. Astonished at the vision he had spoken thus: \"O king, for what\r\nreason or with what object have you left us exposed to an unjust and\r\nhateful suspicion, and left the whole city desolate and plunged in the\r\ndeepest grief?\" He answered, \"It pleased the gods, Proculus, that I\r\nshould spend thus much time among mankind, and after founding a city of\r\nthe greatest power and glory should return to heaven whence I came. Fare\r\nthee well; and tell the Romans that by courage and self-control they\r\nwill attain to the highest pitch of human power. I will ever be for you\r\nthe kindly deity Quirinus.\"\r\n\r\nThis tale was believed by the Romans from the manner of Proculus in\r\nrelating it and from his oath: indeed a religious feeling almost\r\namounting to ecstasy seems to have taken hold of all present; for no one\r\ncontradicted him, but all dismissed their suspicions entirely from their\r\nminds and prayed to Quirinus, worshipping him as a god.\r\n\r\nThis account resembles the Greek legends of Aristeas of Proconnesus, and\r\nthat of Kleomedes of Astypalaea. The story goes that Aristeas died in a\r\nfuller's shop, and that when his friends came to fetch his body it had\r\ndisappeared; then some persons who had just returned from travel said\r\nthat they had met Aristeas walking along the road to Kroton. Kleomedes,\r\nwe are told, was a man of unusual size and strength, but stupid and\r\nhalf-crazy, who did many deeds of violence, and at last in a boy's\r\nschool struck and broke in two the column that supported the roof, and\r\nbrought it down. As the boys were killed, Kleomedes, pursued by the\r\npeople, got into a wooden chest, and shut down the lid, holding in\r\ninside so that many men together were not able to force it open. They\r\nbroke open the chest, and found no man in it, dead or alive. Astonished\r\nat this, they sent an embassy to the oracle at Delphi, to whom the\r\nPythia answered,\r\n\r\n    \"Last of the heroes is Kleomedes of Astypalaea.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it also related that the corpse of Alkmena when it was being carried\r\nout for burial, disappeared, and a stone was found lying on the bier in\r\nits place. And many such stories are told, in which, contrary to reason,\r\nthe earthly parts of our bodies are described as being deified together\r\nwith the spiritual parts. It is wicked and base to deny that virtue is a\r\nspiritual quality, but again it is foolish to mix earthly with heavenly\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nWe must admit, speaking with due caution, that, as Pindar has it, the\r\nbodies of all men follow overpowering Death, but there remains a living\r\nspirit, the image of eternity, for it alone comes from heaven. Thence it\r\ncomes, and thither it returns again, not accompanied by the body, but\r\nonly when it is most thoroughly separated and cleansed from it, and\r\nbecome pure and incorporeal. This is the pure spirit which Herakleitus\r\ncalls the best, which darts through the body like lightning through a\r\ncloud, whereas that which is clogged by the body is like a dull, cloudy\r\nexhalation, hard to loose and free from the bonds of the body. There is\r\nno reason, therefore, for supposing that the bodies of good men rise up\r\ninto heaven, which is contrary to nature; but we must believe that men's\r\nvirtues and their spirits most certainly, naturally and rightly proceed\r\nfrom mankind to the heroes, and from them to the genii, and from thence,\r\nif they be raised above and purified from all mortal and earthly taint,\r\neven as is done in the holy mysteries, then, not by any empty vote of\r\nthe senate, but in very truth and likelihood they are received among the\r\ngods, and meet with the most blessed and glorious end.\r\n\r\nXXIX. Some say that the name Quirinus, which Romulus received, means\r\nMars; others that it was because his people were called Quirites.\r\nOthers, again, say that the spear-head or spear was called by the\r\nancients _Quiris_, and that the statue of Juno leaning on a spear is\r\ncalled Juno Quirites, and that the dart which is placed in the Regia is\r\naddressed as Mars, and that it is customary to present with a spear\r\nthose who have distinguished themselves in war, and therefore that it\r\nwas as a warrior, or god of war, that Romulus was called Quirinus. A\r\ntemple dedicated to him is built on the Quirinal Hill which bears his\r\nname, and the day of his translation is called the People's Flight, and\r\nthe Nonae Caprotinae, because they go out of the city to the Goat's\r\nMarsh on that day to sacrifice, for in Latin a goat is called _Capra_.\r\nAnd as they go to the sacrifice they call out many of the names of the\r\ncountry, as Marcus, Lucius, Caius, with loud shouts, in imitation of\r\ntheir panic on that occasion, and their calling to each other in fear\r\nand confusion. But some say that this is not an imitation of terror, but\r\nof eagerness, and that this is the reason of it: after the Gauls had\r\ncaptured Rome and been driven out by Camillus, and the city through\r\nweakness did not easily recover itself, an army of Latins, under one\r\nLivius Postumius, marched upon it. He halted his army not far from Rome,\r\nand sent a herald to say that the Latins were willing to renew their old\r\ndomestic ties, which had fallen into disuse, and to unite the races by\r\nnew intermarriage. If, therefore, the Romans would send out to them all\r\ntheir maidens and unmarried women, they would live with them on terms of\r\npeace and friendship, as the Romans had long before done with the\r\nSabines. The Romans, when they heard this, were afraid of going to war,\r\nyet thought that the surrender of their women was no better than\r\ncaptivity. While they were in perplexity, a female slave named Philotis,\r\nor according to some Tutola, advised them to do neither, but by a\r\nstratagem to avoid both war and surrender of the women. This stratagem\r\nwas that they should dress Philotis and the best looking of the other\r\nfemale slaves like free women, and send them to the enemy; then at night\r\nPhilotis said she would raise a torch, and the Romans should come under\r\narms and fall upon the sleeping enemy. This was done, and terms were\r\nmade with the Latins. Philotis raised the torch upon a certain fig-tree\r\nwith leaves which spread all round and behind, in such a manner that the\r\nlight could not be seen by the enemy, but was clearly seen by the\r\nRomans. When they saw it, they immediately rushed out, calling\r\nfrequently for each other at the various gates in their eagerness. As\r\nthey fell unexpectedly upon the enemy, they routed them, and keep the\r\nday as a feast. Therefore the Nones are called Caprotinae because of the\r\nfig-tree, which the Romans call _caprificus_, and the women are feasted\r\nout of doors, under the shade of fig-tree boughs. And the female slaves\r\nassemble and play, and afterwards beat and throw stones at each other,\r\nas they did then, when they helped the Romans to fight. These accounts\r\nare admitted by but few historians, and indeed the calling out one\r\nanother's names in the daytime, and walking down to the Goats' Marsh\r\nseems more applicable to the former story, unless, indeed, both of these\r\nevents happened on the same day.\r\n\r\nRomulus is said to have been fifty-four years old, and to be in the\r\nthirty-eighth year of his reign when he disappeared from the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF THESEUS AND ROMULUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The above are all the noteworthy particulars which we have been able\r\nto collect about Theseus and Romulus. It seems, in the first place, that\r\nTheseus of his own free will, and without any compulsion, when he might\r\nhave reigned peacefully in Troezen, where he was heir to the kingdom, no\r\nmean one, longed to accomplish heroic deeds: whereas Romulus was an\r\nexile, and in the position of a slave; the fear of death was hanging\r\nover him if unsuccessful, and so, as Plato says, he was made brave by\r\nsheer terror, and through fear of suffering death and torture was forced\r\ninto doing great exploits. Moreover, Romulus's greatest achievement was\r\nthe slaying of one man, the despot of Alba, whereas Skeiron, Sinis,\r\nProkrustes, and Korynetes were merely the accompaniments and prelude to\r\nthe greater actions of Theseus, and by slaying them he freed Greece from\r\nterrible scourges, before those whom he saved even knew who he was. He\r\nalso might have sailed peacefully over the sea to Athens, and had no\r\ntrouble with those brigands, whereas Romulus could not be free from\r\ntrouble while Amulius lived. And it is a great argument in favour of\r\nTheseus that he attacked those wicked men for the sake of others, having\r\nhimself suffered no wrong at their hands; whereas the twins were\r\nunconcerned at Amulius's tyranny so long as it did not affect\r\nthemselves. And although it may have been a great exploit to receive a\r\nwound in fighting the Sabines, and to slay Acron, and to kill many\r\nenemies in battle, yet we may compare with these, on Theseus's behalf,\r\nhis battle with the Centaurs and his campaign against the Amazons. As\r\nfor the courage which Theseus showed in the matter of the Cretan\r\ntribute, when he voluntarily sailed to Crete with the youths and\r\nmaidens, whether the penalty was to be given to the Minotaur to eat, or\r\nbe sacrificed at the tomb of Androgeus, or even to be cast into\r\ndishonoured slavery under an insolent enemy, which is the least\r\nmiserable fate mentioned by any writer, what a strength of mind, what\r\npublic spirit and love of fame it shows! In this instance it seems to me\r\nthat philosophers have truly defined love as a \"service designed by the\r\ngods for the care and preservation of the young.\" For the love of\r\nAriadne seems to have been specially intended by Heaven to save Theseus;\r\nnor need we blame her for her passion, but rather wonder that all men\r\nand women did not share it. If she alone felt it, then I say she\r\ndeserved the love of a god, because of her zeal for all that is best and\r\nnoblest.\r\n\r\nII. Both were born statesmen, yet neither behaved himself as a king\r\nshould do, but, from similar motives, the one erred on the side of\r\ndemocracy, the other on that of despotism. The first duty of a king is\r\nto preserve his crown; and this can be effected as well by refraining\r\nfrom improperly extending his rights as by too great eagerness to keep\r\nthem. For he who either gives up or overstrains his prerogative ceases\r\nto be a king or constitutional ruler, but becomes either a despot or\r\ndemagogue; and in the one case is feared, in the other despised by his\r\nsubjects. Still the one is the result of kindliness of disposition, and\r\nthe other that of selfishness and ferocity.\r\n\r\nIII. If we are not to attribute their misfortunes to chance, but to\r\npeculiarities of disposition, then we cannot acquit Romulus of blame in\r\nhis treatment of his brother, nor Theseus in that of his son; but the\r\ngreatest excuse must be made for the one who acted under the greatest\r\nprovocation. One would not have thought that Romulus would have flown\r\ninto such a passion during a grave deliberation on matters of state;\r\nwhile Theseus was misled, in his treatment of his son, by love and\r\njealousy and a woman's slander, influences which few men are able to\r\nwithstand. And what is more, Romulus's fury resulted in actual deeds of\r\nunfortunate result; whereas the anger of Theseus spent itself in words\r\nand an old man's curses, and the youth seems to have owed the rest of\r\nhis suffering to chance; so here, at any rate, one would give one's\r\nvote for Theseus.\r\n\r\nIV. Romulus, however, has the credit of having started with the most\r\nslender resources, and yet of having succeeded. The twins were called\r\nslaves and the sons of a swineherd before they achieved their liberty;\r\nyet they freed nearly all the Latin race, and at one and the same time\r\ngained those titles which are the most glorious among men, of slayers of\r\ntheir enemies, preservers of their own house, kings of their own nation,\r\nand founders of a new city, not by transferring the population of old\r\nones, as Theseus did, when he brought together many towns into one, and\r\ndestroyed many cities that bore the names of kings and heroes of old.\r\nRomulus did this afterwards, when he compelled his conquered enemies to\r\ncast down and obliterate their own dwellings, and become fellow-citizens\r\nwith their conquerors; yet at first he did not change the site of his\r\ncity nor increase it, but starting with nothing to help him, he obtained\r\nfor himself territory, patrimony, sovereignty, family, marriage, and\r\nrelatives, and he killed no one, but conferred great benefits on those\r\nwho, instead of homeless vagrants, wished to become a people and\r\ninhabitants of a city. He slew no brigands or robbers, but he conquered\r\nkingdoms, took cities, and triumphed over kings and princes.\r\n\r\nV. As for the misfortune of Remus, it seems doubtful whether Romulus\r\nslew him with his own hand, as most writers attribute the act to others.\r\nHe certainly rescued his mother from death, and gloriously replaced his\r\ngrandfather, whom he found in an ignoble and servile position, on the\r\nthrone of Aeneas. He did him many kindnesses, and never harmed him even\r\nagainst his will. But I can scarcely imagine that Theseus's\r\nforgetfulness and carelessness in hoisting the black sail can, by any\r\nexcuses or before the mildest judges, come much short of parricide:\r\nindeed, an Athenian, seeing how hard it is even for his admirers to\r\nexculpate him, has made up a story that Aegeus, when the ship was\r\napproaching, hurriedly ran up to the acropolis to view it, and fell\r\ndown, as though he were unattended, or would hurry along the road to the\r\nshore without servants.\r\n\r\nVI. The crimes of Theseus in carrying off women are without any decent\r\nexcuse; first, because he did it so often, for he carried off Ariadne\r\nand Antiope and Anaxo of Troezen, and above all when he was an old man\r\nhe carried off Helen, when she was not yet grown up, and a mere child,\r\nthough he was past the age for even legitimate marriage. Besides, there\r\nwas no reason for it, for these Troezenian, Laconian, and Amazonian\r\nmaidens, besides their not being betrothed to him, were no worthier\r\nmothers for his children than the Athenian daughters of Erechtheus and\r\nKekrops would have been, so we must suspect that these acts were done\r\nout of mere riotous wantonness.\r\n\r\nNow Romulus, though he carried off nearly eight hundred women, yet kept\r\nonly one, Hersilia, for himself, and distributed the others among the\r\nunmarried citizens; and afterwards, by the respect, love, and justice\r\nwith which he treated them, proved that his wrongful violence was the\r\nmost admirable and politic contrivance for effecting the union of the\r\ntwo nations. By means of it he welded them into one, and made it the\r\nstarting-point of harmony at home and strength abroad. The dignity,\r\nlove, and permanence with which he invested the institution of marriage\r\nis proved by the fact that during two hundred and thirty years no man\r\nseparated from his wife or woman from her husband; but, just as in\r\nGreece, very exact persons can mention the first instance of parricide\r\nor matricide, so all the Romans know that Spurius Carvilius was the\r\nfirst who put away his wife, upon a charge of barrenness. Events also\r\ntestify to the superior wisdom of Romulus, for, in consequence of that\r\nintermarriage, the two kings and the two races shared the empire,\r\nwhereas, from the marriage of Theseus, the Athenians obtained no\r\nalliance or intercourse with any nation, but only hatreds and wars and\r\ndeaths of citizens and at last the destruction of Aphidnae, and they\r\nthemselves escaped from the fate which Paris brought upon Troy, only by\r\nthe mercy of their enemies and their own entreaties and supplications.\r\nThe mother of Theseus, not nearly but quite, suffered the fate of\r\nHekuba, who was abandoned and given up by her son, unless the story of\r\nher captivity is false, as I hope it is, together with much of the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nAlso the religious part of their histories makes a great distinction\r\nbetween them. For Romulus's success was due to the great favour of\r\nHeaven, whereas the oracle given to Aegeus, to refrain from all women in\r\nforeign parts, seems to argue that the birth of Theseus took place\r\ncontrary to the will of the gods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF LYKURGUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. With regard to Lykurgus the lawgiver there is nothing whatever that\r\nis undisputed; as his birth, his travels, his death, and, besides all\r\nthis, his legislation, have all been related in various ways; and also\r\nthe dates of his birth do not in any way accord. Some say that he was\r\ncontemporary with Iphitus, and with him settled the conditions of the\r\nOlympic truce; and among these is Aristotle the philosopher, who adduces\r\nas a proof of it the quoit which is at Olympia, on which the name of\r\nLykurgus is still preserved. Others, among them Eratosthenes and\r\nApollodorus, by computing the reigns of the kings of Sparta,[A] prove\r\nthat he must have lived many years before the first Olympiad. Timaeus\r\nconjectures that there were two men of the name of Lykurgus in Sparta at\r\ndifferent times, and that the deeds of both are attributed to one of\r\nthem, on account of his celebrity. The elder, he thinks, must have lived\r\nnot far off the time of Homer; indeed some say that he came into the\r\npresence of Homer. Xenophon gives an idea of his antiquity when he\r\nspeaks of him as living in the time of the Herakleidae. By descent of\r\ncourse the last kings of Sparta are Herakleidae, but he appears to mean\r\nby Herakleidae the earliest of all, who were next to Herakles himself.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: In the Spartan constitution there were two kings, who were\r\nbelieved to be descended from two brothers, Eurysthenes and Prokles, the\r\ntwo sons of Aristodemus. When the descendants of Herakles returned to\r\nPeloponnesus, and divided that country amongst them, Lacedaemon fell to\r\nthe lot of Aristodemus, who left his two sons joint heirs to the\r\nmonarchy. The kings of Sparta had little real power, and to this no\r\ndoubt they owed the fact of their retaining their dignity when every\r\nother Hellenic state adopted a democratic form of government.]\r\n\r\nHowever, in spite of these discrepancies, we will endeavour, by\r\nfollowing the least inconsistent accounts and the best known\r\nauthorities, to write the history of his life. Simonides the poet tells\r\nus that the father of Lykurgus was not Eunomus, but Prytanis. But most\r\nwriters do not deduce his genealogy thus, but say that Soüs was the son\r\nof Prokles, and grandson of Aristodemus, and that Soüs begat Euripus;\r\nEuripus, Prytanis, and Prytanis, Eunomus. Eunomus had two sons,\r\nPolydektes by his first wife, and Lykurgus by his second wife Dionassa,\r\nwhich makes him, according to Dieutychides, sixth in descent from\r\nProkles, and eleventh from Herakles.\r\n\r\nII. The most remarkable of his ancestors was Soüs, in whose reign the\r\nSpartans enslaved the Helots, and annexed a large portion of Arcadia. It\r\nis said that Soüs once was besieged by the Kleitorians, in a fort where\r\nthere was no water, and was compelled to conclude a treaty to restore\r\nthe territory in dispute, if he and his men were permitted to drink at\r\nthe nearest spring. After this had been agreed upon, he called his men\r\ntogether, and offered his kingdom to any one who could refrain from\r\ndrinking. But as no one could do this, but all drank, last of all he\r\nhimself came down to the spring, and in the presence of the enemy merely\r\nsprinkled his face with the water, and marched off, refusing to restore\r\nthe disputed territory, on the ground that all did not drink. But though\r\nhe gained great fame by this, yet it was not he but his son Eurypon who\r\ngave the name of Eurypontidae to the family, because Eurypon was the\r\nfirst to relax the despotic traditions of his family and render his\r\ngovernment more popular with the people. But as a consequence of this\r\nthe people were encouraged to demand more freedom, and great confusion\r\nand lawlessness prevailed in Sparta for a long time, because some of the\r\nkings opposed the people and so became odious, while others were found\r\nto yield to them, either to preserve their popularity, or from sheer\r\nweakness of character. It was during this period of disorder that the\r\nfather of Lykurgus lost his life. He was endeavouring to part two men\r\nwho were quarrelling, and was killed by a blow from a cook's chopper,\r\nleaving the kingdom to his elder son Polydektes.\r\n\r\nIII. He also died after a short time, and, as all thought, Lykurgus\r\nought to have been the next king. And he did indeed reign until his\r\nbrother's wife was found to be pregnant; but as soon as he heard this,\r\nhe surrendered the crown to the child, if it should be a boy, and merely\r\nadministered the kingdom as guardian for the child. The Lacedaemonian\r\nname for the guardian of a royal orphan is _prodikus_. Now the queen\r\nmade a secret proposal to him, that she should destroy her infant and\r\nthat they should live together as king and queen. Though disgusted at\r\nher wickedness, he did not reject the proposal, but pretended to approve\r\nof it. He said that she must not risk her life and injure her health by\r\nprocuring abortion, but that he would undertake to do away with the\r\nchild. Thus he deluded her until her confinement, at which time he sent\r\nofficials and guards into her chamber with orders to hand the child over\r\nto the women if it was a girl, and to bring it to him, whatever he might\r\nbe doing, if it was a boy. He happened to be dining with the archons\r\nwhen a male child was born, and the servants brought it to him. He is\r\nsaid to have taken the child and said to those present, \"A king is born\r\nto you, O Spartans,\" and to have laid him down in the royal seat and\r\nnamed him Charilaus, because all men were full of joy admiring his\r\nspirit and justice. He was king for eight months in all; and was much\r\nlooked up to by the citizens, who rendered a willing obedience to him,\r\nrather because of his eminent virtues than because he was regent with\r\nroyal powers. There was, nevertheless, a faction which grudged him his\r\nelevation, and tried to oppose him, as he was a young man.\r\n\r\nThey consisted chiefly of the relatives and friends of the queen-mother,\r\nwho considered that she had been insultingly treated, and her brother\r\nLeonidas once went so far in his abusive language as to hint to Lykurgus\r\nthat he knew that he meant to be king, throwing the suspicion upon\r\nLykurgus, if anything should happen to the child, that he would be\r\nsupposed to have managed it. This sort of language was used by the\r\nqueen-mother also, and he, grieved and alarmed, decided to avoid all\r\nsuspicion by leaving the country and travelling until his nephew should\r\nbe grown up and have an heir born to succeed him.\r\n\r\nIV. With this intention he set sail, and first came to Crete, where he\r\nstudied the constitution and mixed with the leading statesmen. Some part\r\nof their laws he approved and made himself master of, with the\r\nintention of adopting them on his return home, while with others he was\r\ndissatisfied. One of the men who had a reputation there for learning and\r\nstate-craft he made his friend, and induced him to go to Sparta. This\r\nwas Thales, who was thought to be merely a lyric poet, and who used this\r\nart to conceal his graver acquirements, being in reality deeply versed\r\nin legislation. His poems were exhortations to unity and concord in\r\nverse, breathing a spirit of calm and order, which insensibly civilised\r\ntheir hearers and by urging them to the pursuit of honourable objects\r\nled them to lay aside the feelings of party strife so prevalent in\r\nSparta; so that he may be said in some degree to have educated the\r\npeople and prepared them to receive the reforms of Lykurgus.\r\n\r\nFrom Crete Lykurgus sailed to Asia Minor, wishing, it is said, to\r\ncontrast the thrifty and austere mode of life of the Cretans with the\r\nextravagance and luxury of the Ionians, as a physician compares healthy\r\nand diseased bodies, and to note the points of difference in the two\r\nstates. There, it seems, he first met with the poems of Homer, which\r\nwere preserved by the descendants of Kreophylus, and observing that they\r\nwere no less useful for politics and education than for relaxation and\r\npleasure, he eagerly copied and compiled them, with the intention of\r\nbringing them home with him. There was already some dim idea of the\r\nexistence of these poems among the Greeks, but few possessed any\r\nportions of them, as they were scattered in fragments, but Lykurgus\r\nfirst made them known. The Egyptians suppose that Lykurgus visited them\r\nalso, and that he especially admired their institution of a separate\r\ncaste of warriors. This he transferred to Sparta, and, by excluding\r\nworking men and the lower classes from the government, made the city a\r\ncity indeed, pure from all admixture. Some Greek writers corroborate the\r\nEgyptians in this, but as to Lykurgus having visited Libya and Iberia,\r\nor his journey to India and meeting with the Gymnosophists, or naked\r\nphilosophers, there, no one that we know of tells this except the\r\nSpartan Aristokrates, the son of Hipparchus.\r\n\r\nV. During Lykurgus's absence the Lacedaemonians regretted him and sent\r\nmany embassies to ask him to return, telling him that their kings had\r\nindeed the royal name and state, but nothing else to distinguish them\r\nfrom the common people, and that he alone had the spirit of a ruler and\r\nthe power to influence men's minds. Even the kings desired his presence,\r\nas they hoped that he would assist in establishing their authority and\r\nwould render the masses less insolent. Returning to a people in this\r\ncondition, he at once began alterations and reforms on a sweeping scale,\r\nconsidering that it was useless and unprofitable to do such work by\r\nhalves, but that, as in the case of a diseased body, the original cause\r\nof the disorder must be burned out or purged away, and the patient begin\r\nan entirely new life. After reflecting on this, he made a journey to\r\nDelphi. Here he sacrificed to the god, and, on consulting the oracle,\r\nreceived that celebrated answer in which the Pythia speaks of him as\r\nbeloved by the gods, and a god rather than a man, and when he asked for\r\na good system of laws, answered that the god gives him what will prove\r\nby far the best of all constitutions. Elated by this he collected the\r\nleading men and begged them to help him, first by talking privately to\r\nhis own friends, and thus little by little obtaining a hold over more\r\nmen and banding them together for the work. When the time was ripe for\r\nthe attempt, he bade thirty of the nobles go into the market-place early\r\nin the morning completely armed, in order to overawe the opposition. The\r\nnames of twenty of the most distinguished of these men have been\r\npreserved by Hermippus, but the man who took the greatest part in all\r\nLykurgus's works, and who helped him in establishing his laws, was\r\nArthmiades. At first King Charilaus was terrified at the confusion,\r\nimagining that a revolt had broken out against himself, and fled for\r\nrefuge to the temple of Minerva of the Brazen House; but, afterward\r\nreassured and having received solemn pledges for his safety, returned\r\nand took part in their proceedings. He was of a gentle nature, as is\r\nproved by the words of his colleague, King Archelaus, who, when some\r\nwere praising the youth, said, \"How can Charilaus be a good man, if he\r\nis not harsh even to wicked men?\"\r\n\r\nOf Lykurgus's many reforms, the first and most important was the\r\nestablishment of the Council of Elders, which Plato says by its\r\nadmixture cooled the high fever of royalty, and, having an equal vote\r\nwith the kings on vital points, gave caution and sobriety to their\r\ndeliberations. For the state, which had hitherto been wildly oscillating\r\nbetween despotism on the one hand and democracy on the other, now, by\r\nthe establishment of the Council of the Elders, found a firm footing\r\nbetween these extremes, and was able to preserve a most equable balance,\r\nas the eight-and-twenty elders would lend the kings their support in the\r\nsuppression of democracy, but would use the people to suppress any\r\ntendency to despotism. Twenty-eight is the number of Elders mentioned by\r\nAristotle, because of the thirty leading men who took the part of\r\nLykurgus two deserted their post through fear. But Sphairus says that\r\nthose who shared his opinions were twenty-eight originally. A reason may\r\nbe found in twenty-eight being a mystic number, formed by seven\r\nmultiplied by four, and being the first perfect number after six, for\r\nlike that, it is equal to all its parts.[A] But I think that he probably\r\nmade this number of elders, in order that with the two kings the council\r\nmight consist of thirty members in all.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: 14, 2, 7, 4, 1, make by addition 28; as 3, 2, and 1 make\r\n6.]\r\n\r\nVI. Lykurgus was so much interested in this council as to obtain from\r\nDelphi an oracle about it, called the _rhetra_, which runs as follows:\r\n\"After you have built a temple to Zeus of Greece and Athene of Greece,\r\nand have divided the people into _tribes_ and _obes_, you shall found a\r\ncouncil of thirty, including the chiefs, and shall from season to season\r\n_apellazein_ the people between Babyka and Knakion, and there propound\r\nmeasures and divide upon them, and the people shall have the casting\r\nvote and final decision.\" In these words tribes and obes are divisions\r\ninto which the people were to be divided; the chiefs mean the kings;\r\n_apellazein_ means to call an assembly, in allusion to Apollo, to whom\r\nthe whole scheme of the constitution is referred. Babyka and Knakion\r\nthey now call Oinous; but Aristotle says that Knakion is a river and\r\nBabyka a bridge. Between these they held their assemblies, without any\r\nroof or building of any kind; for Lykurgus did not consider that\r\ndeliberations were assisted by architecture, but rather hindered, as\r\nmen's heads were thereby filled with vain unprofitable fancies, when\r\nthey assemble for debate in places where they can see statues and\r\npaintings, or the proscenium of a theatre, or the richly ornamented roof\r\nof a council chamber. When the people were assembled, he permitted no\r\none to express an opinion; but the people was empowered to decide upon\r\nmotions brought forward by the kings and elders. But in later times, as\r\nthe people made additions and omissions, and so altered the sense of the\r\nmotions before them, the kings, Polydorus and Theopompus, added these\r\nwords to the _rhetra_, \"and if the people shall decide crookedly, the\r\nchiefs and elders shall set it right.\" That is, they made the people no\r\nlonger supreme, but practically excluded them from any voice in public\r\naffairs, on the ground that they judged wrongly. However these kings\r\npersuaded the city that this also was ordained by the god. This is\r\nmentioned by Tyrtaeus in the following verses:\r\n\r\n    \"They heard the god, and brought from Delphi home,\r\n      Apollo's oracle, which thus did say:\r\n    That over all within fair Sparta's realm\r\n      The royal chiefs in council should bear sway,\r\n    The elders next to them, the people last;\r\n      If they the holy _rhetra_ would obey.\"\r\n\r\nVII. Though Lykurgus had thus mixed the several powers of the state, yet\r\nhis successors, seeing that the powers of the oligarchy were unimpaired,\r\nand that it was, as Plato calls it, full of life and vigour, placed as a\r\ncurb to it the power of the Ephors. The first Ephors, of whom Elatus was\r\none, were elected about a hundred and thirty years after Lykurgus, in\r\nthe reign of Theopompus. This king is said to have been blamed by his\r\nwife because he would transmit to his children a less valuable crown\r\nthan he had received, to which he answered: \"Nay, more valuable, because\r\nmore lasting.\" In truth, by losing the odium of absolute power, the King\r\nof Sparta escaped all danger of being dethroned, as those of Argos and\r\nMessene were by their subjects, because they would abate nothing of\r\ntheir despotic power. The wisdom of Lykurgus became clearly manifest to\r\nthose who witnessed the revolutions and miseries of the Argives and\r\nMessenians, who were neighbouring states and of the same race as the\r\nSpartans, who, originally starting on equal terms with them, and indeed\r\nseeming in the allotment of their territories to have some advantage,\r\nyet did not long live happily, but the insolent pride of the kings and\r\nthe unruly temper of the people together resulted in a revolution, which\r\nclearly proved that the checked and balanced constitution established\r\namong the Spartans was a divine blessing for them. But of this more\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nVIII. The second and the boldest of Lykurgus's reforms was the\r\nredistribution of the land. Great inequalities existed, many poor and\r\nneedy people had become a burden to the state, while wealth had got into\r\na very few hands. Lykurgus abolished all the mass of pride, envy, crime,\r\nand luxury which flowed from those old and more terrible evils of riches\r\nand poverty, by inducing all land-owners to offer their estates for\r\nredistribution, and prevailing upon them to live on equal terms one with\r\nanother, and with equal incomes, striving only to surpass each other in\r\ncourage and virtue, there being henceforth no social inequalities among\r\nthem except such as praise or blame can create.\r\n\r\nPutting his proposals immediately into practice, he divided the outlying\r\nlands of the state among the Perioeki, in thirty thousand lots, and that\r\nimmediately adjoining the metropolis among the native Spartans, in nine\r\nthousand lots, for to that number they then amounted. Some say that\r\nLykurgus made six thousand lots, and that Polydorus added three thousand\r\nafterwards; others that he added half the nine thousand, and that only\r\nhalf was allotted by Lykurgus.\r\n\r\nEach man's lot was of such a size as to supply a man with seventy\r\nmedimni of barley, and his wife with twelve, and oil and wine in\r\nproportion; for thus much he thought ought to suffice them, as the food\r\nwas enough to maintain them in health, and they wanted nothing more. It\r\nis said that, some years afterwards, as he was returning from a journey\r\nthrough the country at harvest-time, when he saw the sheaves of corn\r\nlying in equal parallel rows, he smiled, and said to his companions that\r\nall Laconia seemed as if it had just been divided among so many\r\nbrothers.\r\n\r\nIX. He desired to distribute furniture also, in order completely to do\r\naway with inequality; but, seeing that actually to take away these\r\nthings would be a most unpopular measure, he managed by a different\r\nmethod to put an end to all ostentation in these matters. First of all\r\nhe abolished the use of gold and silver money, and made iron money alone\r\nlegal; and this he made of great size and weight, and small value, so\r\nthat the equivalent for ten minae required a great room for its stowage,\r\nand a yoke of oxen to draw it. As soon as this was established, many\r\nsorts of crime became unknown in Lacedaemon. For who would steal or take\r\nas a bribe or deny that he possessed or take by force a mass of iron\r\nwhich he could not conceal, which no one envied him for possessing,\r\nwhich he could not even break up and so make use of; for the iron when\r\nhot was, it is said, quenched in vinegar, so as to make it useless, by\r\nrendering it brittle and hard to work?\r\n\r\nAfter this, he ordered a general expulsion of the workers in useless\r\ntrades. Indeed, without this, most of them must have left the country\r\nwhen the ordinary currency came to an end, as they would not be able to\r\nsell their wares: for the iron money was not current among other Greeks,\r\nand had no value, being regarded as ridiculous; so that it could not be\r\nused for the purchase of foreign trumpery, and no cargo was shipped for\r\na Laconian port, and there came into the country no sophists, no\r\nvagabond soothsayers, no panders, no goldsmiths or workers in silver\r\nplate, because there was no money to pay them with. Luxury, thus cut off\r\nfrom all encouragement, gradually became extinct; and the rich were on\r\nthe same footing with other people, as they could find no means of\r\ndisplay, but were forced to keep their money idle at home. For this\r\nreason such things as are useful and necessary, like couches and tables\r\nand chairs, were made there better than anywhere else, and the Laconian\r\ncup, we are told by Kritias, was especially valued for its use in the\r\nfield. Its colour prevented the drinker being disgusted by the look of\r\nthe dirty water which it is sometimes necessary to drink, and it was\r\ncontrived that the dirt was deposited inside the cup and stuck to the\r\nbottom, so as to make the drink cleaner than it would otherwise have\r\nbeen. These things were due to the lawgiver; for the workmen, who were\r\nnot allowed to make useless things, devoted their best workmanship to\r\nuseful ones.\r\n\r\nX. Wishing still further to put down luxury and take away the desire for\r\nriches, he introduced the third and the most admirable of his reforms,\r\nthat of the common dining-table. At this the people were to meet and\r\ndine together upon a fixed allowance of food, and not to live in their\r\nown homes, lolling on expensive couches at rich tables, fattened like\r\nbeasts in private by the hands of servants and cooks, and undermining\r\ntheir health by indulgence to excess in every bodily desire, long sleep,\r\nwarm baths, and much repose, so that they required a sort of daily\r\nnursing like sick people. This was a great advantage, but it was a\r\ngreater to render wealth valueless, and, as Theophrastus says, to\r\nneutralise it by their common dining-table and the simplicity of their\r\nhabits. Wealth could not be used, nor enjoyed, nor indeed displayed at\r\nall in costly apparatus, when the poor man dined at the same table with\r\nthe rich; so that the well-known saying, that \"wealth is blind and lies\r\nlike a senseless log,\" was seen to be true in Sparta alone of all cities\r\nunder heaven. Men were not even allowed to dine previously at home, and\r\nthen come to the public table, but the others, watching him who did not\r\neat or drink with them, would reproach him as a sensual person, too\r\neffeminate to eat the rough common fare.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons it is said that the rich were bitterly opposed to\r\nLykurgus on this question, and that they caused a tumult and attacked\r\nhim with shouts of rage. Pelted with stones from many hands, he was\r\nforced to run out of the market-place, and take sanctuary in a temple.\r\nHe outstripped all his pursuers except one, a hot-tempered and spirited\r\nyouth named Alkander, who came up with him, and striking him with a club\r\nas he turned round, knocked out his eye. Lykurgus paid no heed to the\r\npain, but stood facing the citizens and showed them his face streaming\r\nwith blood, and his eye destroyed. All who saw him were filled with\r\nshame and remorse. They gave up Alkander to his mercy, and conducted him\r\nin procession to his own house, to show their sympathy. Lykurgus thanked\r\nthem and dismissed them, but took Alkander home with him. He did him no\r\nharm and used no reproachful words, but sent away all his servants and\r\nbade him serve him. Alkander, being of a generous nature, did as he was\r\nordered, and, dwelling as he did with Lykurgus, watching his kind\r\nunruffled temper, his severe simplicity of life, and his unwearied\r\nlabours, he became enthusiastic in his admiration of him, and used to\r\ntell his friends and acquaintances that Lykurgus, far from being harsh\r\nor overbearing, was the kindest and gentlest of men. Thus was Alkander\r\ntamed and subdued, so that he who had been a wicked and insolent youth\r\nwas made into a modest and prudent man.\r\n\r\nAs a memorial of his misfortune, Lykurgus built the temple of Athene,\r\nwhom he called Optilitis, for the Dorians in that country call the eyes\r\n_optiloi_. Some writers, however, among whom is Dioskorides, who wrote\r\nan 'Account of the Spartan Constitution,' say that Lykurgus was struck\r\nupon the eye, but not blinded, and that he built this temple as a\r\nthank-offering to the goddess for his recovery.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, it was in consequence of his mishap that the Spartans\r\ndiscontinued the habit of carrying staffs when they met in council.\r\n\r\nXI. The Cretans call this institution of taking meals in common\r\n_andreia_, which means _men's_ repast; but the Lacedaemonians call it\r\n_phiditia_, which can either be explained as another form of _philia_,\r\nfriendship, putting a _d_ for an _l_, from the friendly feelings which\r\nprevailed at them, or else because it accustomed them to frugality,\r\nwhich is called _pheido_. Possibly the first letter was an addition, and\r\nthe word may have originally been _editia_, from _edodé_, food.\r\n\r\nThey formed themselves into messes of fifteen, more or less. Each member\r\ncontributed per month a _medimnus_ of barley, eight measures of wine,\r\nfive minas' weight of cheese, and half as much of figs; and in addition\r\nto this a very small sum of money to buy fish and other luxuries for a\r\nrelish to the bread. This was all, except when a man had offered a\r\nsacrifice, or been hunting, and sent a portion to the public table. For\r\npersons were allowed to dine at home whenever they were late for dinner\r\nin consequence of a sacrifice or a hunting expedition, but the rest of\r\nthe company had to be present. This custom of eating in common lasted\r\nfor very many years. When King Agis returned from his victorious\r\ncampaign against the Athenians, and wished to dine at home with his\r\nwife, he sent for his share of the public dinner, and the polemarchs\r\nrefused to let him have it. As next day, through anger, he did not offer\r\nthe customary sacrifice, they fined him. Boys were taken to the public\r\ntables, as though they were schools of good manners; and there they\r\nlistened to discourses on politics, and saw models of gentlemanly\r\nbehaviour, and learned how to jest with one another, joking without\r\nvulgarity, and being made the subjects of jokes without losing their\r\ntemper. Indeed, it was considered peculiarly Laconian to be able to take\r\na joke; however, if the victim could not, he was entitled to ask that it\r\nshould go no farther. As they came in, the eldest present said to each\r\nman, pointing to the door, \"Through this no tale passes.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said that they voted for a new member of a mess in this manner.\r\nEach man took a piece of bread crumb and threw it in silence into a\r\nvessel, which a servant carried on his head. Those who voted for the new\r\nmember threw in their bread as it was, those who voted against, crushed\r\nit flat in their hands. If even one of these crushed pieces be found,\r\nthey rejected the candidate, as they wished all members of the society\r\nto be friendly. The candidate was said to be rejected by the\r\n_kaddichus_, which is their name for the bowl into which the bread is\r\nthrown.\r\n\r\nThe \"black broth\" was the most esteemed of their luxuries, insomuch that\r\nthe elder men did not care for any meat, but always handed it over to\r\nthe young, and regaled themselves on this broth. It is related that, in\r\nconsequence of the celebrity of this broth, one of the kings of Pontus\r\nobtained a Laconian cook, but when he tasted it he did not like it. His\r\ncook thereupon said, \"O king, those who eat this broth must first bathe\r\nin the Eurotas.\" After drinking wine in moderation the guests separate,\r\nwithout any torches; for it is not permitted to walk with a light on\r\nthis or any other occasion, in order that they may accustom themselves\r\nto walk fearlessly and safely in the dark. This then is the way in which\r\nthe common dining-tables are managed.\r\n\r\nXII. Lykurgus did not establish any written laws; indeed, this is\r\ndistinctly forbidden by one of the so-called Rhetras.\r\n\r\nHe thought that the principles of most importance for the prosperity and\r\nhonour of the state would remain most securely fixed if implanted in the\r\ncitizens by habit and training, as they would then be followed from\r\nchoice rather than necessity; for his method of education made each of\r\nthem into a lawgiver like himself. The trifling conventions of everyday\r\nlife were best left undefined by hard-and-fast laws, so that they might\r\nfrom time to time receive corrections or additions from men educated in\r\nthe spirit of the Lacedaemonian system. On this education the whole\r\nscheme of Lykurgus's laws depended. One _rhetra_, as we have seen,\r\nforbade the use of written laws. Another was directed against\r\nexpenditure, and ordered that the roof of every house should consist of\r\nbeams worked with the axe, and that the doors should be worked with the\r\nsaw alone, and with no other tools. Lykurgus was the first to perceive\r\nthe truth which Epameinondas is said in later times to have uttered\r\nabout his own table, when he said that \"such a dinner has no room for\r\ntreachery.\" He saw that such a house as that has no place for luxury and\r\nexpense, and that there is no man so silly and tasteless as to bring\r\ncouches with silver feet, purple hangings, or golden goblets into a\r\nsimple peasant's house, but that he would be forced to make his\r\nfurniture match the house, and his clothes match his furniture, and so\r\non. In consequence of this it is said that the elder Leotychides when\r\ndining in Corinth, after looking at a costly panelled ceiling, asked his\r\nhost whether the trees grew square in that country. A third _rhetra_ of\r\nLykurgus is mentioned, which forbids the Spartans to make war frequently\r\nwith the same people, lest by constant practice they too should become\r\nwarlike. And this especial accusation was subsequently brought against\r\nKing Agesilaus in later times, that, by his frequent and long-continued\r\ninvasions of Boeotia, he made the Thebans a match for the\r\nLacedaemonians; for which cause Antalkidas, when he saw him wounded,\r\nsaid, \"The Thebans pay you well for having taught them to fight, which\r\nthey were neither willing nor able to do before.\"\r\n\r\nMaxims of this sort they call _rhetras_, which are supposed to have a\r\ndivine origin and sanction.\r\n\r\nXIII. Considering education to be the most important and the noblest\r\nwork of a lawgiver, he began at the very beginning, and regulated\r\nmarriages and the birth of children. It is not true that, as Aristotle\r\nsays, he endeavoured to regulate the lives of the women, and failed,\r\nbeing foiled by the liberty and habits of command which they had\r\nacquired by the long absences of their husbands on military expeditions,\r\nduring which they were necessarily left in sole charge at home,\r\nwherefore their husbands looked up to them more than was fitting,\r\ncalling them Mistresses; but he made what regulations were necessary for\r\nthem also. He strengthened the bodies of the girls by exercise in\r\nrunning, wrestling, and hurling quoits or javelins, in order that their\r\nchildren might spring from a healthy source and so grow up strong, and\r\nthat they themselves might have strength, so as easily to endure the\r\npains of childbirth. He did away with all affectation of seclusion and\r\nretirement among the women, and ordained that the girls, no less than\r\nthe boys, should go naked in processions, and dance and sing at\r\nfestivals in the presence of the young men. The jokes which they made\r\nupon each man were sometimes of great value as reproofs for ill-conduct;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, by reciting verses written in praise of the\r\ndeserving, they kindled a wonderful emulation and thirst for distinction\r\nin the young men: for he who had been praised by the maidens for his\r\nvalour went away congratulated by his friends; while, on the other hand,\r\nthe raillery which they used in sport and jest had as keen an edge as a\r\nserious reproof; because the kings and elders were present at these\r\nfestivals as well as all the other citizens. This nakedness of the\r\nmaidens had in it nothing disgraceful, as it was done modestly, not\r\nlicentiously, producing simplicity, and teaching the women to value good\r\nhealth, and to love honour and courage no less than the men. This it was\r\nthat made them speak and think as we are told Gorgo, the wife of\r\nLeonidas, did. Some foreign lady, it seems, said to her, \"You Laconian\r\nwomen are the only ones that rule men.\" She answered, \"Yes; for we alone\r\nbring forth men.\"\r\n\r\nXIV. These were also incentives to marriage, I mean these processions,\r\nand strippings, and exercises of the maidens in the sight of the young\r\nmen, who, as Plato says, are more swayed by amorous than by mathematical\r\nconsiderations; moreover, he imposed certain penalties on the unmarried\r\nmen. They were excluded from the festival of the Gymnopaedia, in honour\r\nof Athene; and the magistrates ordered them during winter to walk naked\r\nround the market-place, and while doing so to sing a song written\r\nagainst themselves, which said that they were rightly served for their\r\ndisobedience to the laws; and also they were deprived of the respect and\r\nobservance paid by the young to the elders.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that no one blamed the young man for not rising before\r\nDerkyllidas, famous general as he was. This youth kept his seat, saying,\r\n\"You have not begotten a son to rise before me.\"\r\n\r\nTheir marriage custom was for the husband to carry off his bride by\r\nforce. They did not carry off little immature girls, but grown up women,\r\nwho were ripe for marriage. After the bride had been carried off the\r\nbridesmaid received her, cut her hair close to her head, dressed her in\r\na man's cloak and shoes, and placed her upon a couch in a dark chamber\r\nalone. The bridegroom, without any feasting and revelry, but as sober as\r\nusual, after dining at his mess, comes into the room, looses her virgin\r\nzone, and, after passing a short time with her, retires to pass the\r\nnight where he was wont, with the other young men. And thus he\r\ncontinued, passing his days with his companions, and visiting his wife\r\nby stealth, feeling ashamed and afraid that any one in the house should\r\nhear him, she on her part plotting and contriving occasions for meeting\r\nunobserved. This went on for a long time, so that some even had children\r\nborn to them before they ever saw their wives by daylight. These\r\nconnections not only exercised their powers of self-restraint, but also\r\nbrought them together with their bodies in full vigour and their\r\npassions unblunted by unchecked intercourse with each other, so that\r\ntheir passion and love for each other's society remained unextinguished.\r\n\r\nHaving thus honoured and dignified the married state, he destroyed the\r\nvain womanish passion of jealousy, for, while carefully avoiding any\r\ndisorder or licentiousness, he nevertheless permitted men to associate\r\nworthy persons with them in the task of begetting children, and taught\r\nthem to ridicule those who insisted on the exclusive possession of their\r\nwives, and who were ready to fight and kill people to maintain their\r\nright. It was permitted to an elderly husband, with a young wife, to\r\nassociate with himself any well-born youth whom he might fancy, and to\r\nadopt the offspring as his own.\r\n\r\nAnd again, it was allowable for a respectable man, if he felt any\r\nadmiration for a virtuous mother of children, married to some one else,\r\nto induce her husband to permit him to have access to her, that he might\r\nas it were sow seed in a fertile field, and obtain a fine son from a\r\nhealthy stock. Lykurgus did not view children as belonging to their\r\nparents, but above all to the state; and therefore he wished his\r\ncitizens to be born of the best possible parents; besides the\r\ninconsistency and folly which he noticed in the customs of the rest of\r\nmankind, who are willing to pay money, or use their influence with the\r\nowners of well-bred stock, to obtain a good breed of horses or dogs,\r\nwhile they lock up their women in seclusion and permit them to have\r\nchildren by none but themselves, even though they be mad, decrepit, or\r\ndiseased; just as if the good or bad qualities of children did not\r\ndepend entirely upon their parents, and did not affect their parents\r\nmore than any one else.\r\n\r\nBut although men lent their wives in order to produce healthy and useful\r\ncitizens, yet this was so far from the licence which was said to prevail\r\nin later times with respect to women, that adultery was regarded amongst\r\nthem as an impossible crime. A story is told of one Geradas, a very old\r\nSpartan, who, when asked by a stranger what was done to adulterers among\r\nthem, answered, \"Stranger, there are no adulterers with us.\" \"And if\r\nthere were one?\" asked the stranger. \"Then,\" said Geradas, \"he would\r\nhave to pay as compensation a bull big enough to stand on Mount Täygetus\r\nand drink from the river Eurotas.\" The stranger, astonished, asked\r\n\"Where can you find so big a bull?\" \"Where can you find an adulterer in\r\nSparta?\" answered Geradas. This is what is said about their marriage\r\nceremonies.\r\n\r\nXV. A father had not the right of bringing up his offspring, but had to\r\ncarry it to a certain place called Lesché, where the elders of the tribe\r\nsat in judgment upon the child. If they thought it well-built and\r\nstrong, they ordered the father to bring it up, and assigned one of the\r\nnine thousand plots of land to it; but if it was mean-looking or\r\nmisshapen, they sent it away to the place called the Exposure, a glen\r\nupon the side of Mount Täygetus; for they considered that if a child did\r\nnot start in possession of health and strength, it was better both for\r\nitself and for the state that he should not live at all. Wherefore the\r\nwomen used to wash their newborn infants with wine, not with water, to\r\nmake trial of their constitution. It was thought that epileptic or\r\ndiseased children shrank from the wine and fell into convulsions, while\r\nhealthy ones were hardened and strengthened by it. A certain supervision\r\nwas exercised over the nurses, making them bring up the children without\r\nswaddling clothes, so as to make their movements free and unconfined,\r\nand also to make them easily satisfied, not nice as to food, not afraid\r\nin the dark, not frightened at being alone, not peevish and fretful. For\r\nthis reason, many foreigners used to obtain Lacedaemonian nurses for\r\ntheir children, and it is said that Amykla, the nurse of Alkibiades, was\r\na Lacedaemonian. But Plato tells us that Perikles put him under the care\r\nof one Zopyrus, who was no better than the other slaves; whereas\r\nLykurgus would not intrust the Spartan boys to any bought or hired\r\nservants, nor was each man allowed to bring up and educate his son as he\r\nchose, but as soon as they were seven years of age he himself received\r\nthem from their parents, and enrolled them in companies. Here they lived\r\nand messed in common, and were associated for play and for work.\r\nHowever, a superintendent of the boys was appointed, one of the best\r\nborn and bravest men of the state, and they themselves in their troops\r\nchose as leader him who was wisest, and fiercest in fight. They looked\r\nto him for orders, obeyed his commands, and endured his punishments, so\r\nthat even in childhood they learned to obey. The elder men watched them\r\nat their play, and by instituting fights and trials of strength,\r\ncarefully learned which was the bravest and most enduring. They learned\r\ntheir letters, because they are necessary, but all the rest of their\r\neducation was meant to teach them to obey with cheerfulness, to endure\r\nlabours, and to win battles. As they grew older their training became\r\nmore severe; they were closely shorn, and taught to walk unshod and to\r\nplay naked. They wore no tunic after their twelfth year, but received\r\none garment for all the year round. They were necessarily dirty, as they\r\nhad no warm baths and ointments, except on certain days, as a luxury.\r\nThey slept all together in troops and companies, on beds of rushes which\r\nthey themselves had picked on the banks of the Eurotas with their hands,\r\nfor they were not allowed to use a knife. In winter they mixed the herb\r\ncalled lycophon with the rushes, as it is thought to possess some\r\nwarmth.\r\n\r\nXVI. At this age the elder men took even greater interest in them,\r\nfrequenting the gymnasia where they were, and listening to their\r\nrepartees with each other, and that not in a languid careless manner,\r\nbut just as if each thought himself the father, instructor, and captain\r\nof them all.\r\n\r\nThus no time was left unemployed, and no place was left without some one\r\nto give good advice and punish wrong-doing; although a regular\r\nsuperintendent of the boys was appointed from the leading men of the\r\ncity, and they had their own chiefs, who were the wisest and bravest of\r\nthe Eirenes. This is a name given to those who have begun their second\r\nyear after ceasing to be children, and the eldest of the children are\r\ncalled Melleirenes. This Eiren, who is twenty years old, commands his\r\ncompany in their battles, and in the house uses them as his servants to\r\nprepare dinner. He orders the bigger boys to carry logs of wood, and the\r\nlittle ones to gather pot herbs. They also bring him what they steal,\r\nwhich they do, some from the gardens, and some from the men's\r\ndining-tables, where they rush in very cleverly and cautiously; for if\r\none be taken, he is severely scourged for stealing carelessly and\r\nclumsily. They also steal what victuals they can, learning to take them\r\nfrom those who are asleep or off their guard. Whoever is caught is\r\npunished by stripes and starvation. Their meals are purposely made\r\nscanty, in order that they may exercise their ingenuity and daring in\r\nobtaining additions to them. This is the main object of their short\r\ncommons, but an incidental advantage is the growth of their bodies, for\r\nthey shoot up in height when not weighed down and made wide and broad by\r\nexcess of nutriment. This also is thought to produce beauty of figure;\r\nfor lean and slender frames develop vigour in the limbs, whereas those\r\nwhich are bloated and over-fed cannot attain this, from their weight.\r\nThis we see in the case of women who take purgatives during pregnancy,\r\nwhose children are thin, but well-shaped and slender, because from their\r\nslight build they receive more distinctly the impress of their mother's\r\nform. However, it may be that the cause of this phenomenon is yet to be\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nXVII. The boys steal with such earnestness that there is a story of one\r\nwho had taken a fox's cub and hidden it under his cloak, and, though his\r\nentrails were being torn out by the claws and teeth of the beast,\r\npersevered in concealing it until he died. This may be believed from\r\nwhat the young men in Lacedaemon do now, for at the present day I have\r\nseen many of them perish under the scourge at the altar of Diana\r\nOrthias.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the Eiren would recline, and bid one of the boys sing, and\r\nask another some questions which demand a thoughtful answer, such as\r\n\"Who is the best among men?\" or \"How is such a thing done?\" By this\r\nteaching they began even in infancy to be able to judge what is right,\r\nand to be interested in politics; for not to be able to answer the\r\nquestions, \"Who is a good citizen?\" or \"Who is a man of bad repute?\" was\r\nthought to be the sign of a stupid and unaspiring mind. The boy's answer\r\nwas required to be well reasoned, and put into a small compass; he who\r\nanswered wrongly was punished by having his thumb bitten by the Eiren.\r\nOften when elders and magistrates were present the Eiren would punish\r\nthe boys; if only he showed that it was done deservedly and with method,\r\nhe never was checked while punishing, but when the boys were gone, he\r\nwas called to account if he had done so either too cruelly or too\r\nremissly.\r\n\r\nThe lovers of the boys also shared their honour or disgrace; it is said\r\nthat once when a boy in a fight let fall an unmanly word, his lover was\r\nfined by the magistrates. Thus was love understood among them; for even\r\nfair and honourable matrons loved young maidens, but none expected their\r\nfeelings to be returned. Rather did those who loved the same person make\r\nit a reason for friendship with each other, and vie with one another in\r\ntrying to improve in every way the object of their love.\r\n\r\nXVIII. The boys were taught to use a sarcastic yet graceful style of\r\nspeaking, and to compress much thought into few words; for Lykurgus made\r\nthe iron money have little value for its great size, but on the other\r\nhand he made their speech short and compact, but full of meaning,\r\nteaching the young, by long periods of silent listening, to speak\r\nsententiously and to the point. For those who allow themselves much\r\nlicence in speech seldom say anything memorable. When some Athenian\r\njeered at the small Laconian swords, and said that jugglers on the stage\r\ncould easily swallow them, King Agis answered, \"And yet with these\r\nlittle daggers we can generally reach our enemies.\" I think that the\r\nLaconian speech, though it seems so short, yet shows a great grasp of\r\nthe subject and has great power over the listeners. Lykurgus himself\r\nseems to have been short and sententious, to judge from what has been\r\npreserved of his sayings; as, for instance, that remark to one who\r\nproposed to establish a democracy in the state, \"First establish a\r\ndemocracy in your own household.\" And when he was asked why he ordained\r\nthe sacrifices to be so small and cheap, he answered, \"It is in order\r\nthat we may never be forced to omit them.\" So too in gymnastic\r\nexercises, he discouraged all those which are not performed with the\r\nhand closed.\r\n\r\nThe same class of answers are said to have been made by him to his\r\nfellow-countrymen in his letters. When they asked how they should keep\r\noff their enemies, he answered, \"By remaining poor, and not each trying\r\nto be a greater man than the other.\" Again, about walls, he said, \"that\r\ncannot be called an open town which has courage, instead of brick walls\r\nto defend it.\" As to the authenticity of these letters, it is hard to\r\ngive an opinion.\r\n\r\nXIX.--The following anecdotes show their dislike of long speeches. When\r\nsome one was discoursing about matters useful in themselves at an\r\nunfitting time, King Leonidas said, \"Stranger, you speak of what is\r\nwanted when it is not wanted.\" Charilaus the cousin of Lykurgus, when\r\nasked why they had so few laws answered, that men of few words required\r\nfew laws. And Archidamidas, when some blamed Hekataeus the Sophist for\r\nhaving said nothing during dinner, answered, \"He who knows how to speak\r\nknows when to speak also.\" The following are some of those sarcastic\r\nsayings which I before said are not ungrateful. Demaratus, when some\r\nworthless fellow pestered him with unreasonable queries, and several\r\ntimes inquired, \"Who is the best man in Sparta?\" answered, \"He who is\r\nleast like you.\" When some were praising the magnificence and justice\r\nwith which the Eleans conducted the Olympian games, Agis said, \"What is\r\nthere so very remarkable in the people of Elis acting justly on one day\r\nin every five years?\"\r\n\r\nA stranger was vaunting his admiration of them, and was saying that in\r\nhis own city he was called a lover of Sparta. Theopompus observed, \"It\r\nwould be more to your credit to be called a lover of your own city.\"\r\nPleistoanax the son of Pausanias, when an Athenian orator reproached the\r\nLacedaemonians for ignorance, observed, \"What you say is quite true, for\r\nwe are the only Greeks who have not learned some mischief from you.\"\r\n\r\nWhen a stranger asked Archidamidas how many Spartans there were, he\r\nanswered, \"Enough to keep off bad men.\"\r\n\r\nOne may also discover their peculiarities in their jokes; for they are\r\ntaught never to talk at random, nor to utter a syllable that does not\r\ncontain some thought. As, when one of them was invited to hear a man\r\nimitate the nightingale, he answered, \"I have heard the original;\" and\r\nthe man who read this epigram--\r\n\r\n    \"These men, to quench a tyrant's pride,\r\n    Before Selinus fought and died.\"\r\n\r\n\"These men,\" said he, \"deserved to die; for, instead of quenching it,\r\nthey should have let it burn itself out.\" When a young man was promised\r\na present of cocks that would fight till they died, he said, \"I had\r\nrather have some that will fight and kill their foes.\" This was the\r\nstyle of their talk; so that some have well said that philosophy is more\r\ntruly Laconian than gymnastic exercises.\r\n\r\nXX.--Their education in poetry and music was no less carefully watched\r\nover than their cleverness and purity of speech, but their songs were\r\nsuch as rouse men's blood and stir them to deeds of prowess, written in\r\nplain unaffected language, upon noble and edifying subjects. For the\r\nmost part they consisted of panegyrics upon those who had been happy\r\nenough to die for their country, reproaches of cowards for living a\r\nmiserable life, and encouragement to bravery suitable to those of all\r\nages. A good instance of this is that on festivals when there are three\r\nchoruses, that of the old men first sang--\r\n\r\n    \"We once were lusty youths and tall.\"\r\n\r\nThen that of the young men sang--\r\n\r\n    \"We still are stout; come, try a fall,\"\r\n\r\nand the third, that of the children, rejoined--\r\n\r\n    \"But we'll be stronger than you all.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, if one pays any attention to such Laconian poetry as is still\r\nextant, and to the march music which was played on the flutes when they\r\nwere going to meet their enemies, it becomes clear that Terpander and\r\nPindar were right in connecting poetry with bravery. The former speaks\r\nthus of the Lacedaemonians:\r\n\r\n    \"Where the youths are bold with the spear,\r\n    And the voice of the muse is clear,\r\n    And justice to all is dear.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Pindar says of them--\r\n\r\n    \"Where the old are wise in council,\r\n      And the young are brave in fight;\r\n    Where song and dance are honoured\r\n      On many a festal night.\"\r\n\r\nFor they represent them as being most warlike and at the same time most\r\npoetical.\r\n\r\n    \"The sword with song full well combines,\"\r\n\r\nas the Laconian poet says. Even in their battles the king first\r\nsacrificed to the Muses, to remind them, it would appear, of their\r\neducation and their former contests, that they may be bold in danger,\r\nand do deeds worthy of record in the fight.\r\n\r\nXXI.--In time of war, too, they relaxed their strict rules and allowed\r\ntheir young men to dress their hair and ornament their shields and\r\ncostumes, taking a pride in them such as one does in high-mettled\r\nhorses. For this reason, although they all let their hair grow long\r\nafter the age of puberty, yet it was especially in time of danger that\r\nthey took pains to have it smooth and evenly parted, remembering a\r\nsaying of Lykurgus about the hair, that it made a well-looking man look\r\nhandsomer, and an ugly man look more ferocious.\r\n\r\nDuring a campaign they made the young men perform less severe gymnastic\r\nexercises, and allowed them to live a freer life in other respects, so\r\nthat, for them alone of all mankind, war was felt as a relief from\r\npreparation for war. When their array was formed and the enemy were in\r\nsight, the king used to sacrifice a kid, and bid them all put on\r\ngarlands, and the pipers to play the hymn to Kastor; then he himself\r\nbegan to sing the paean for the charge, so that it was a magnificent and\r\nterrible spectacle to see the men marching in time to the flutes, making\r\nno gap in their lines, with no thought of fear, but quietly and steadily\r\nmoving to the sound of the music against the enemy. Such men were not\r\nlikely to be either panic-stricken or over-confident, but had a cool and\r\ncheerful confidence, believing that the gods were with them.\r\n\r\nWith the king used to march into battle a Spartan who had won a crown\r\nin the public games of Greece. It is said that one of them was offered a\r\nmighty bribe at Olympia, but refused to take it, and with great trouble\r\nthrew his adversary in the wrestling-match. Some one then asked him,\r\n\"Laconian, what have you gained by your victory?\" The man, smiling with\r\ndelight, answered, \"I shall fight in front of the king in the wars.\"\r\nAfter they had routed their enemy and gained the victory, they were wont\r\nto pursue so far as to render their success secure, and then to draw\r\noff, as they did not think it manly or befitting a Greek to cut down and\r\nbutcher those who could fight no longer.\r\n\r\nThis was not merely magnanimous, but very useful to them, for their\r\nenemies, knowing that they slew those who resisted, but spared those who\r\ngave way, often judged it better for themselves to flee than to stand\r\ntheir ground.\r\n\r\nXXII. The sophist Hippias states that Lykurgus himself was a great\r\nwarrior and took part in many campaigns; and Philostephanus even\r\nattributed to Lykurgus the division of the cavalry into the troops\r\ncalled _oulamos_. This, according to him, consisted of a troop of fifty\r\nhorsemen drawn up in a square. Demetrius Phalereus, on the other hand,\r\nsays that he had no experience in war, and arranged the whole\r\nconstitution in time of peace. Moreover the institution of the Olympic\r\ntruce seems to be the idea of a man of gentle and peaceful temperament,\r\nsome however say, according to Hermippus, that Lykurgus had at first no\r\ncommunication with Iphitus, but happened to be present in the crowd;\r\nthat he then heard a voice as it were of a man behind him blaming him\r\nand wondering why he did not encourage his fellow-citizens to take part\r\nin the festival. As, when he turned round, there was no one who could\r\nhave said so, he concluded that it was a divine warning, and, at once\r\njoining Iphitus and assisting him in regulating the festival, he\r\nrendered it both more splendid and more lasting.\r\n\r\nXXIII. The training of the Spartan youth continued till their manhood.\r\nNo one was permitted to live according to his own pleasure, but they\r\nlived in the city as if in a camp, with a fixed diet and fixed public\r\nduties, thinking themselves to belong, not to themselves, but to their\r\ncountry. Those who had nothing else to do, either looked after the\r\nyoung, and taught them what was useful, or themselves learned such\r\nthings from the old. For ample leisure was one of the blessings with\r\nwhich Lykurgus provided his countrymen, seeing that they were utterly\r\nforbidden to practise any mechanical art, while money-making and\r\nbusiness were unnecessary, because wealth was disregarded and despised.\r\nThe Helots tilled the ground, and produced the regular crops for them.\r\nIndeed, a Spartan who was at Athens while the courts were sitting, and\r\nwho learned that some man had been fined for idleness, and was leaving\r\nthe court in sorrow accompanied by his grieving friends, asked to be\r\nshown the man who had been punished for gentlemanly behaviour. So\r\nslavish did they deem it to labour at trade and business. In Sparta, as\r\nwas natural, lawsuits became extinct, together with money, as the people\r\nhad neither excess nor deficiency, but all were equally well off, and\r\nenjoyed abundant leisure by reason of their simple habits. All their\r\ntime was spent in dances, feasting, hunting or gymnastic exercises and\r\nconversation, when they were not engaged in war.\r\n\r\nXXIV. Those who were less than thirty years old never came into the\r\nmarket-place at all, but made their necessary purchases through their\r\nfriends and relations. And it was thought discreditable to the older men\r\nto be seen there much, and not to spend the greater part of the day in\r\nthe gymnasium and the _lesches_ or places for conversation. In these\r\nthey used to collect together and pass their leisure time, making no\r\nallusions to business or the affairs of commerce, but their chief study\r\nbeing to praise what was honourable, and contemn what was base in a\r\nlight satiric vein of talk which was instructive and edifying to the\r\nhearers. Nor was Lykurgus himself a man of unmixed austerity: indeed, he\r\nis said by Sosibius to have set up the little statue of the god of\r\nlaughter, and introduced merriment at proper times to enliven their\r\nwine-parties and other gatherings. In a word, he trained his countrymen\r\nneither to wish nor to understand how to live as private men, but, like\r\nbees, to be parts of the commonwealth, and gather round their chief,\r\nforgetting themselves in their enthusiastic patriotism, and utterly\r\ndevoted to their country. This temper of theirs we can discern in many\r\nof their sayings. Paidaretus, when not elected into the three hundred,\r\nwent away rejoicing that the city possessed three hundred better men\r\nthan himself. Polykratidas, when he went with some others on a mission\r\nto the generals of the great king, was asked by them, if he and his\r\nparty came as private persons or as ambassadors? He answered, \"As\r\nambassadors, if we succeed; as private men, if we fail.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when some citizens of Amphipolis came to Lacedaemon, and went to see\r\nthe mother of Brasidas, Argileonis, she asked them whether Brasidas died\r\nbravely and worthily of Sparta. When they praised him to excess, and\r\nsaid that he had not left his like behind, she said, \"Say not so,\r\nstrangers; Brasidas was a noble and a gallant man, but Sparta has many\r\nbetter than he.\"\r\n\r\nXXV. Lykurgus himself composed his senate, as we have seen, of the\r\npersons who took part in his plot; and in future be ordained that\r\nvacancies should be filled up by those men, upwards of sixty years of\r\nage, who were adjudged to be the most worthy.\r\n\r\nThis seemed the greatest prize in the world, and also the most difficult\r\nto obtain; for it was not merely that a man should be adjudged swiftest\r\nof the swift, or strongest of the strong, but he had to be chosen as the\r\nbest and wisest of all good and wise men, and, as a prize, was to obtain\r\npower to regulate the morals of the state, as he was intrusted with\r\npowers of life and death, and disfranchisement, and with all the highest\r\npenalties.\r\n\r\nThe elections took place as follows: The citizens were all assembled,\r\nand certain men were placed in a building close by, where they could\r\nneither see nor be seen, but merely hear the shouts of the general\r\nassembly. They decided these, as indeed they did other contests, by\r\nshouts of approval, not of all at once, but lots were cast, and each\r\ncandidate in the order denoted by his lot came forward and silently\r\nwalked through the assembly. The men locked up in the building had\r\nwriting materials, and noted down who was cheered most loudly, not\r\nknowing who each man was, beyond that he was first, second, third, and\r\nso on, of the candidates. They then told the number of the man for whom\r\nthere had been most voices, and he crowned himself with a garland and\r\noffered sacrifice to the gods, followed by many of the young men, who\r\ncongratulated him, and by many women, who sang songs praising his\r\nvirtues and his felicity. As he went from one temple to another, each of\r\nhis relatives used to offer him food, saying, \"The state honours you\r\nwith this banquet.\" But he would pass by them all, and go to his usual\r\nmess-table. Here nothing uncommon took place, except that he was given a\r\nsecond ration, which he took away with him; and after dinner, the women\r\nof his own family being at the doors of the mess-room, he would call for\r\nthe one whom he wished to honour, and give her his portion, saying that\r\nhe had received it as a prize, and gave it to her as such. This caused\r\nher to be greatly envied by the other women.\r\n\r\nXXVI.--Moreover, he made excellent regulations about funerals. In the\r\nfirst place, he abolished all silly superstition, and raised no\r\nobjections to burial in the city, and to placing tombs near the temples,\r\nin order to accustom the young to such sights from their infancy, so\r\nthat they might not feel any horror of death, or have any notion about\r\nbeing defiled by touching a dead body, or walking among tombs. Next, he\r\npermitted nothing to be buried with the dead, but they placed the body\r\nin the grave, wrapped in a purple cloth and covered with olive-leaves.\r\nIt was not permitted to inscribe the name of the deceased upon his tomb,\r\nexcept in the case of men who had fallen in war, or of women who had\r\nbeen priestesses. A short time was fixed for mourning, eleven days; on\r\nthe twelfth they were to sacrifice to Demeter (Ceres) and cease from\r\ntheir grief. For, in Sparta, nothing was left without regulation, but,\r\nwith all the necessary acts of life, Lykurgus mingled some ceremony\r\nwhich might enkindle virtue or discourage vice; indeed he filled his\r\ncity with examples of this kind, by which the citizens were insensibly\r\nmoulded and impelled towards honourable pursuits. For this reason he\r\nwould not allow citizens to leave the country at pleasure, and to wander\r\nin foreign lands, where they would contract outlandish habits, and\r\nlearn to imitate the untrained lives and ill-regulated institutions to\r\nbe found abroad. Also, he banished from Lacedaemon all strangers who\r\nwere there for no useful purpose; not, as Thucydides says, because he\r\nfeared they might imitate his constitution, and learn something\r\nserviceable for the improvement of their own countries, but rather for\r\nfear that they might teach the people some mischief. Strangers introduce\r\nstrange ideas; and these lead to discussions of an unsuitable character,\r\nand political views which would jar with the established constitution,\r\nlike a discord in music. Wherefore he thought that it was more important\r\nto keep out evil habits than even to keep the plague from coming into\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nXXVII. In all these acts of Lykurgus, we cannot find any traces of the\r\ninjustice and unfairness which some complain of in his laws, which they\r\nsay are excellent to produce courage, but less so for justice. And the\r\ninstitution called Krypteia, if indeed it is one of the laws of\r\nLykurgus, as Aristotle tells us, would agree with the idea which Plato\r\nconceived about him and his system. The Krypteia was this: the leaders\r\nof the young men used at intervals to send the most discreet of them\r\ninto different parts of the country, equipped with daggers and necessary\r\nfood; in the daytime these men used to conceal themselves in\r\nunfrequented spots, and take their rest, but at night they would come\r\ndown into the roads and murder any Helots they found. And often they\r\nwould range about the fields, and make away with the strongest and\r\nbravest Helots they could find. Also, as Thucydides mentions in his\r\nHistory of the Peloponnesian War, those Helots who were especially\r\nhonoured by the Spartans for their valour were crowned as free men, and\r\ntaken to the temples with rejoicings; but in a short time they all\r\ndisappeared, to the number of more than two thousand, and in such a way\r\nthat no man, either then or afterwards, could tell how they perished.\r\nAristotle says that the Ephors, when they first take office, declare war\r\nagainst the Helots, in order that it may be lawful to destroy them. And\r\nmuch other harsh treatment used to be inflicted upon them; and they were\r\ncompelled to drink much unmixed wine, and then were brought into the\r\npublic dining-halls, to show the young what drunkenness is.\r\n\r\nThey were also forced to sing low songs, and to dance low dances, and\r\nnot to meddle with those of a higher character. It is said that when the\r\nThebans made their celebrated campaign in Lacedaemon, they ordered the\r\nHelots whom they captured to sing them the songs of Terpander, and\r\nAlkman, and Spendon the Laconian; but they begged to be excused, for,\r\nthey said, \"the masters do not like it.\" So it seems to have been well\r\nsaid that in Lacedaemon, the free man was more free, and the slave more\r\na slave than anywhere else. This harsh treatment, I imagine, began in\r\nlater times, especially after the great earthquake, when they relate\r\nthat the Helots joined the Messenians, ravaged the country, and almost\r\nconquered it. I cannot impute this wicked act of the Krypteia to\r\nLykurgus, when I consider the gentleness and justice of his general\r\nbehaviour, which also we know was inspired by Heaven.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. When the leading men of the city were thoroughly imbued with the\r\nspirit of his institutions, and the newly constituted state was able to\r\nwalk by itself without leading-strings, and bear its own weight alone,\r\nthen, as Plato says of God, that he was pleased with the world that he\r\nhad created, when it first began to live and move, so was it with\r\nLykurgus. He admired the spectacle of his laws in operation, and, as far\r\nas was possible by human prudence, he desired to leave it eternal and\r\nunchangeable. He assembled all the citizens, and told them that the city\r\nwas now fairly well provided with materials for happiness and virtue,\r\nbut that he would not bestow upon them the most valuable gift of all,\r\nuntil he had taken counsel with Heaven. It was therefore their duty to\r\nabide by the already established laws, and to change and alter nothing\r\ntill he returned from Delphi; on his return, he would do whatever the\r\ngod commanded. They all assented, and bade him depart, and he, after\r\nmaking first the kings and elders, and then the rest of the citizens,\r\nswear that they would keep their existing constitution till Lykurgus\r\ncame back, set out for Delphi. Upon reaching the temple he sacrificed to\r\nthe god, and inquired whether his laws were good, and sufficient for the\r\nprosperity and happiness of his country. Receiving answer from the\r\noracle that his laws were indeed good, and that the city would become\r\nfamous if it kept the constitution of Lykurgus, he wrote down this\r\nprophecy and sent it to Sparta. But he himself, after offering a second\r\nsacrifice to the god, and having embraced his friends and his son,\r\ndetermined not to release his countrymen from their oath, but to put an\r\nend to his own life, being at an age when, though life was still\r\npleasant, it seemed time to go to his rest, after having excellently\r\narranged all his people's affairs. He departed by starvation, as he\r\nthought that a true statesman ought to make even his death of service to\r\nthe state, and not like that of a private person, the useless end of an\r\nidle life. His death came in the fulness of time, after he had done an\r\nexcellent work, and it was left as the guardian of all the good that he\r\nhad done, because the citizens had sworn that they would abide by his\r\nconstitution until he returned to them. Nor was he deceived in his\r\nexpectations; for the state was by far the most celebrated in Greece,\r\nfor good government at home and renown abroad, during a period of five\r\nhundred years, under his constitution, which was kept unaltered by\r\nfourteen kings, counting from himself down to Agis the son of\r\nArchidamus. For the institution of Ephors was not a relaxation, but a\r\nstrengthening of the original scheme, and while it seemed popular it\r\nreally confirmed the power of the oligarchy.\r\n\r\nXXIX. But in the reign of Agis money found its way into Sparta, and,\r\nafter money, selfishness and greed for gain came in, on account of\r\nLysander, who, though himself incorruptible, yet filled his country with\r\nluxury and love of gold, as he brought back gold and silver from the\r\nwars, and disregarded the laws of Lykurgus. Before this, when those laws\r\nwere in force, Sparta was like a wise and practised warrior more than a\r\ncity, or rather, she with her simple staff and cloak, like Herakles with\r\nhis lion-skin and club, ruled over a willing Greece, deposed bad kings\r\nor factions, decided wars, and crushed revolutions; and that, too, often\r\nwithout moving a single soldier, but merely by sending a commissioner,\r\nwho was at once obeyed, even as bees collect and rank themselves in\r\norder when their queen appears. Sparta then had so much order and\r\njustice as to be able to supply her neighbours; and I cannot understand\r\nthose who say that the Lacedaemonians \"knew how to obey, but not how to\r\nrule;\" nor that story of some one who said to king Theopompus that the\r\nsafety of Sparta lay in her kings knowing how to rule. \"Rather,\" he\r\nanswered, \"in her citizens knowing how to obey.\"\r\n\r\nThey would not brook an incapable commander: their very obedience is a\r\nlesson in the art of command; for a good leader makes good followers,\r\nand just as it is the object of the horse-breaker to turn out a gentle\r\nand tractable horse, so it is the object of rulers to implant in men the\r\nspirit of obedience. But the Lacedaemonians produced a desire in other\r\nstates to be ruled by them and to obey them; for they used to send\r\nembassies and ask not for ships or money or troops, but for one Spartan\r\nfor a leader; and when they obtained him, they respected him and feared\r\nhim, as, for instance, the Sicilians had Gylippus as a general, the\r\npeople of Chalkidike had Brasidas, while Lysander and Kallikratidas and\r\nAgesilaus were made use of by all the Greeks in Asia Minor. These men\r\nwere called Regulators and Pacificators in each several state, and the\r\nwhole city of Sparta was regarded as a school and example of orderly\r\npublic life and of settled political institutions. This was alluded to\r\nby Stratonikus when he said in jest that the Athenians ought to conduct\r\nmysteries and shows, the Eleans to be stewards at the games, and the\r\nLacedaemonians to be beaten if the others did not do right. This was not\r\nspoken seriously; but Antisthenes, the Sokratic philosopher, was serious\r\nwhen he said of the Thebans, who were in high spirits after their\r\nvictory at Leuktra, that they were as pleased as schoolboys who had\r\nbeaten their master.\r\n\r\nXXXI. Not that this was Lykurgus's main object, that his country should\r\ndominate over as many other states as possible; but seeing that, in\r\nstates as in individuals, happiness is derived from virtue and\r\nsingle-mindedness, he directed all his efforts to implant in his\r\ncountrymen feelings of honour, self-reliance, and self-control. These\r\nwere also taken as the basis of their constitution by Plato, Diogenes,\r\nZeno, and all who have written with any success upon this subject. But\r\nthey have left mere dissertations; Lykurgus produced an inimitable\r\nconstitution, confuted those who complained of the unreality of the\r\n'Essay on the True Philosopher,' by showing them the spectacle of an\r\nentire city acting like philosophers, and thereby obtained for himself a\r\ngreater reputation than that of any other Greek legislator at any\r\nperiod. For this reason Aristotle says that he has less honour in\r\nLacedaemon than he deserves, although his memory is greatly respected;\r\nfor he has a temple, and they sacrifice to him every year as if he was a\r\ngod. It is also said that after his remains were carried home, his tomb\r\nwas struck by lightning. This distinction befell scarcely any other man\r\nof note except Euripides, who died long after him, and was buried at\r\nArethusa in Macedonia. It was considered a great proof and token of his\r\nfame by the admirers of Euripides, that this should happen to him after\r\nhis death which happened before to the especial favourite of Heaven.\r\nSome say that Lykurgus died at Kirrha, but Apollothemis says that he was\r\ntaken to Elis and died there, and Timaeus and Aristoxenus say that he\r\nended his days in Crete. Aristoxenus even says that the Cretans show his\r\ntomb in what is called the Strangers' Road in Pergamia. He is said to\r\nhave left one son, Antiorus, who died childless, and so ended the\r\nfamily. His companions and relatives and their descendants kept up the\r\npractice of meeting together for a long period; and the days when they\r\nmet were called Lykurgids. Aristokrates the son of Hipparchus says that\r\nwhen Lykurgus died in Crete, his friends burned his body and threw the\r\nashes into the sea, at his own request, as he feared that if any remains\r\nof him should be brought back to Lacedaemon, they would think themselves\r\nabsolved from their oath, and change the constitution. This is the story\r\nof Lykurgus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF NUMA.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. There is a considerable conflict of opinion about the time of King\r\nNuma's reign, although several pedigrees seem to be accurately traced to\r\nhim. One Clodius, in a book on the verification of dates, insists that\r\nall these old records were destroyed during the Gaulish troubles, and\r\nthat those which are now extant were composed by interested persons, by\r\nwhose means men who had no right to such honours claimed descent from\r\nthe noblest families. Though Numa is said to have been a friend of\r\nPythagoras, yet some deny that he had any tincture of Greek learning,\r\narguing that either he was born with a natural capacity for sound\r\nlearning, or that he was taught by some barbarian.[A] Others say that\r\nPythagoras was born much later, some five generations after the times of\r\nNuma, but that Pythagoras the Spartan, who won the Stadium race at\r\nOlympia on the thirteenth Olympiad, wandered into Italy, and there\r\nmeeting Numa, assisted him in the establishment of his constitution; and\r\nthat from this cause, the Roman constitution in many points resembles\r\nthe Laconian. The Olympic games were instituted in the third year of\r\nNuma's reign. Another story is that Numa was a Sabine by birth, and the\r\nSabines consider themselves to be of Lacedaemonian origin. It is hard to\r\nreconcile the dates, especially those which refer to Olympiads, the\r\ntable of which is said to have been made out by Hippias of Elis, on no\r\ntrustworthy basis. However, what things I have heard about Numa that are\r\nworthy of mention I shall proceed to relate, beginning from a\r\nstarting-point of my own.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: That is, by some one who was not a Greek.]\r\n\r\nII. Rome had been founded, and Romulus had reigned, for thirty-seven\r\nyears, when upon the fifth day of the month of July, which day is now\r\ncalled _nonae caprotinae_, he was performing a public sacrifice outside\r\nthe gates, at a place called the Goat's Marsh, in the presence of the\r\nSenate and most of the people. Suddenly a great commotion began in the\r\nair, thick clouds covered the earth, with violent gusts and showers. The\r\npeople fled in terror, and Romulus disappeared. His body could never be\r\nfound, but suspicion fell upon the patricians, and a report was current\r\namong the populace that they had long been jealous of his power as king,\r\nand had determined to get it into their own hands. Indeed, he had dealt\r\nwith them very harshly and tyrannically. Fearing this suspicion, they\r\ngave out that he was not dead, but had been caught up into heaven; and\r\nProclus, a man of mark, swore that he saw Romulus ascend into heaven in\r\nhis armour as he was, and that he heard a voice ordering that he should\r\nbe called Quirinus. Another disturbance took place in Rome about the\r\nelection of the next king, because the new citizens were not yet\r\nthoroughly amalgamated with the old ones, the people were unquiet, and\r\nthe patricians suspicious of one another. Nevertheless they all\r\ndetermined that they would have a king, but they disagreed not merely\r\nabout who, but of what race he should be.\r\n\r\nRomulus's original colonists thought it a monstrous thing that the\r\nSabines, because they had been admitted to a share of the city and the\r\ncountry, should propose to rule over it; while the Sabines not\r\nunreasonably urged that because, after the death of Tatius, they had\r\nacquiesced in Romulus reigning alone, now in their turn they ought to\r\nfurnish a king of their own nation. They had not, they said, been\r\nadopted by a more powerful race than themselves, but had, by their\r\ncombination with the Romans, greatly raised the power and renown of\r\ntheir city.\r\n\r\nThe two races were at issue on these points. The patricians, fearing\r\nthat confusion might arise if the state were left without a head, made\r\none of their own number every day assume the insignia of royalty,\r\nperform the usual sacrifices to the gods, and transact business for six\r\nhours by day, and six by night. This equal division of their periods of\r\nrule was not only just for those in office, but prevented any jealousy\r\nof them being felt by the populace, each day and night, because they saw\r\none who had been a king become a private person. This form of\r\ngovernment the Romans call an interregnum.\r\n\r\nIII. But, although they appeared to manage things so smoothly,\r\nsuspicions and threatenings of disturbance arose, for men said that they\r\nmeditated altering the form of government to an oligarchy, in order to\r\nkeep all political power in their own hands, and would not therefore\r\nelect a king. Hereupon the two factions agreed that one should select a\r\nking from the ranks of the other. This, they thought, would both put an\r\nend to their quarrels for the present, and also ensure the candidate who\r\nshould be chosen being impartial, because he would be friendly to the\r\none party because it had chosen him, and to the other because he\r\nbelonged to it by birth. The Sabines gave the Romans their choice which\r\nthey would do; and they decided that it would be better to choose a\r\nSabine king themselves, than to be ruled by a Roman chosen by the\r\nSabines. After deliberation amongst themselves, they chose Numa\r\nPompilius, a man who was not one of those Sabines who had settled in\r\nRome, but whose excellence was so well-known to all, that the Sabines,\r\nas soon as they heard his name, were even more eager for him than the\r\nRomans who had chosen him. When they had informed the people of their\r\ndecision, they sent an embassy to Numa, composed of the leading men of\r\nboth parties, to beg of him to come to Rome and assume the crown.\r\n\r\nNuma belonged to a celebrated Sabine city, Cures, from which the united\r\nRomans and Sabines called themselves Quirites. He was the son of\r\nPomponius, an honourable citizen, and was the youngest of four brothers.\r\nBy a miraculous coincidence he was born on the very day on which Romulus\r\nfounded Rome; that is, the tenth day before the Calends of May. His\r\nnaturally good disposition had been so educated by sorrow and\r\nphilosophic pursuits, that he rose superior not merely to commonplace\r\nvices, but even to the worship of brute force, so common among\r\nbarbarians, and considered true courage to consist in the conquest of\r\nhis own passions. Accordingly he banished all luxury and extravagance\r\nfrom his house, and was known as a trusty friend and counsellor, both by\r\nhis countrymen and by strangers. When at leisure, he disregarded sensual\r\nenjoyments and money-getting, but devoted himself to the service of the\r\ngods and to speculations about their nature and power, so that he\r\nobtained great celebrity. Indeed Tatius, when he was acting as\r\njoint-king with Romulus, chose him for the husband of his only daughter\r\nTatia. But Numa was not elated by his marriage, and did not remove to\r\nthe town where his father-in-law was king, but stayed where he was in\r\nCures, among the Sabines, tending his aged father; while Tatia also\r\npreferred the quiet of a private citizen's life to the pomp which she\r\nmight have enjoyed in Rome. She is said to have died in the thirteenth\r\nyear after her marriage.\r\n\r\nIV. Now Numa was in the habit of leaving the city and passing much of\r\nhis time in the country, wandering alone in the sacred groves and\r\ndwelling in desert places. Hence the story first arose that it was not\r\nfrom any derangement of intellect that he shunned human society, but\r\nbecause he held converse with higher beings, and had been admitted to\r\nmarriage with the gods, and that, by passing his time in converse with\r\nthe nymph Egeria, who loved him, he became blessed, and learned heavenly\r\nwisdom. It is evident that this is the same as many ancient myths; such\r\nas that told by the Phrygians about Attis, that of the Bithynians about\r\nHerodotus, that of the Arcadians about Endymion, and many others. Yet it\r\nseems probable that a god, who loves man better than bird or beast,\r\nshould take pleasure in conversing with those men who are remarkable for\r\ngoodness, and not despise nor disdain to hold communion with the wise\r\nand righteous. But it is hard to believe that a god or deity could feel\r\nthe passion of love for a human form; although the Egyptians not\r\nunreasonably say, that a woman may be impregnated by the spirit of a\r\ngod, but that a man can have no material union with a god. However it is\r\nvery right to believe that a god can feel friendship for a man, and from\r\nthis may spring a love which watches over him and guides him in the path\r\nof virtue. There is truth in the myths of Phorbas, of Hyacinthus, and of\r\nAdmetus, who were all loved by Apollo, as was also Hippolytus of Sicyon.\r\nIt is said that whenever he set sail from Sikyon to Kirrha on the\r\nopposite coast, the Pythia would recite the verse,\r\n\r\n    \"Now goes our dear Hippolytus to sea,\"\r\n\r\nas if the god knew that he was coming and rejoiced at it.\r\n\r\nThere is also a legend that Pan loved Pindar and his verses; and for the\r\nMuse's sake, Hesiod and Archilochus were honoured after their deaths;\r\nwhile Sophokles during his life is said, by a legend which remains\r\ncurrent at the present day, to have become the friend of Aesculapius,\r\nand on his death to have had the rites of burial supplied by the care of\r\nanother god.\r\n\r\nIf, then, we believe the legends which are told about these persons, why\r\nshould we doubt that Zaleukus, Minos, Zoroaster, Numa, and Lykurgus were\r\ninspired by Heaven, when they governed their kingdoms and gave them\r\nlaws? We may suppose that the gods, when in an earnest mood, would hold\r\nconverse with such men as these, the best of their kind, to talk with\r\nand encourage them, just as they visit the poets, if they do at all,\r\nwhen inclined for pleasure. However, if any one thinks differently, as\r\nBacchylides says, \"The way is broad.\"\r\n\r\nThe other view, which some take about Lykurgus and Numa and such men,\r\nseems very plausible, that they, having to deal with an obstinate and\r\nunmanageable people when introducing great political changes, invented\r\nthe idea of their own divine mission as a means of safety for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nV. It was in Numa's fortieth year that the envoys came from Rome to ask\r\nhim to be king. Their spokesmen were Proculus and Velesius, one of whom\r\nhad very nearly been elected king, for the Romulus people inclined much\r\nto Proculus, and those of Tatius were equally in favour of Velesius.\r\nThese men made a short speech, imagining that Numa would be delighted\r\nwith his fortune; but it appears that it took much hard pleading to\r\ninduce a man who had lived all his life in peace to take the command of\r\na city which owed its origin and its increase alike to war. He said, in\r\nthe presence of his father and of Marcius, one of his relations, \"Every\r\nchange in a man's life is dangerous; and when a man is not in want of\r\nanything needful, and has no cause for being dissatisfied with his lot,\r\nit is sheer madness for him to change his habits and way of life; for\r\nthese, at any rate, have the advantage of security, while in the new\r\nstate all is uncertain. Not even uncertain are the perils of royalty,\r\njudging from Romulus himself, who was suspected of having plotted\r\nagainst his partner Tatius, and whose peers were suspected of having\r\nassassinated him. Yet these men call Romulus the child of the gods, and\r\ntell how he had a divinely sent nurse, and was preserved by a miracle\r\nwhile yet a child; while I was born of mortal parents, and brought up by\r\npeople whom you all know: even the points which you praise in my\r\ncharacter are far from those which make a good king, being love of\r\nleisure and of unprofitable speculation, and also a great fondness for\r\npeace and unwarlike matters, and for men who meet together for the glory\r\nof the gods or for cheerful converse with one another, and who at other\r\ntimes plough their fields and feed their cattle at home. But you Romans\r\nhave very likely many wars left upon your hands by Romulus, for the\r\nconduct of which the state requires a vigorous warrior in the prime of\r\nlife. The people too, from their successes, are accustomed to and eager\r\nfor war, and are known to be longing for fresh conquests and\r\npossessions; so that they would ridicule me when I told them to honour\r\nthe gods and act justly, and if I tried to instil a hatred of wars and\r\nof brute force into a city which wants a general more than a king.\"\r\n\r\nVI. As he refused the offered crown in such terms, the Romans used every\r\nkind of entreaty to induce him to accept it, begging him not to plunge\r\nthe state again into civil war, because there was no other man whom the\r\ntwo parties would agree to receive as their king. In their absence, his\r\nfather and Marcius begged him not to refuse so great and marvellous an\r\noffer. \"If,\" they said, \"you do not desire wealth, because of your\r\nsimple life, and do not care for the glory of royalty, because you\r\nderive more glory from your own virtue, yet think that to be king is to\r\nserve God, who gives you this office and will not allow your\r\nrighteousness to lie idle, useful only to yourself. Do not therefore\r\nshrink from assuming this office, which gives you an opportunity to\r\nconduct the solemn ceremonials of religion with due pomp, and to\r\ncivilise the people and turn their hearts, which can be effected more\r\neasily by a king than by any one else. This people loved Tatius, though\r\nhe was a foreigner, and they respect the memory of Romulus as if he was\r\na god. And who knows, if the people, although victorious, may not have\r\nhad enough of wars, and, sated with triumphs and spoils, may not be\r\ndesirous of a gentle and just ruler under whom they may enjoy rest and\r\npeace. If, however, they are madly bent upon war, is it not better that\r\nyou should hold the reins, and direct their fury elsewhere, becoming\r\nyourself a bond of union and friendship between the Sabine nation and\r\nthis powerful and flourishing city?\" Besides these arguments, it is said\r\nthat the omens were favourable, and that the people of the city, as soon\r\nas they heard of the embassy, came and besought him to go and become\r\nking, and thus unite and combine the two races.\r\n\r\nVII. When he had made up his mind, he sacrificed to the gods, and\r\nstarted for Rome. The Senate and people met him and showed great\r\naffection for him; the matrons also greeted him, and there were\r\nsacrifices in the temples, and every one was as joyous as if he had\r\nreceived a kingdom instead of a king. When they came into the Forum, the\r\n_interrex_ or temporary king, Spurius Vettius, put it to the vote, and\r\nall the people voted for Numa. When they offered him the insignia of\r\nroyalty, he bade them stop, saying that he wished to have his crown\r\nconfirmed to him by God as well as by man. Taking the prophets and\r\npriests he ascended the Capitol, which the Romans at that time called\r\nthe Tarpeian Hill. There the chief of the prophets made him turn towards\r\nthe south, covered his head, and then standing behind him with his hand\r\nlaid upon his head, he prayed, and looked for a sign or omen sent from\r\nthe gods in every quarter of the heavens. A strange silence prevailed\r\namong the people in the Forum, as they watched him eagerly, until a\r\nprosperous omen was observed. Then Numa received the royal robes and\r\ncame down from the hill among the people. They received him with cheers\r\nand congratulations, as the most pious of men, and as beloved of Heaven.\r\nWhen he became king, his first act was to disband the body-guard of\r\nthree hundred men, whom Romulus always had kept about his person, who\r\nwere called _Celeres_, that is, swift; for Numa would not distrust a\r\nloyal people nor reign over a disloyal one. Next he instituted a third\r\nhigh priest, in addition to the existing priests of Jupiter and Mars,\r\nwhom, in honour of Romulus, he called the Flamen Quirinalis. The elder\r\npriests are called Flamens from the skull-caps which they wear, and the\r\nword is derived from the Greek word for felt; for at that time Greek\r\nwords were mingled with Latin ones more than now. For instance, the\r\n_laena_ worn by the priests is said by Juba to be the Greek _chlaina_,\r\nand the boy, whose parents must be both alive, who is servant to the\r\npriest of Jupiter, is called _Camillus_, just as the Greeks sometimes\r\ncall Hermes (Mercury) _Cadmilus_, from his being the servant of the\r\ngods.\r\n\r\nVIII. Numa, after confirming his popularity by these measures, proceeded\r\nat once to attempt to convert the city from the practice of war and the\r\nstrong hand, to that of right and justice, just as a man tries to soften\r\nand mould a mass of iron. The city at that time was indeed what Plato\r\ncalls \"inflamed and angry,\" for it owed its very existence to the\r\nreckless daring by which it had thrust aside the most warlike races of\r\nthe country, and had recruited its strength by many campaigns and\r\nceaseless war, and, as carpentry becomes more fixed in its place by\r\nblows, so the city seemed to gain fresh power from its dangers. Thinking\r\nthat it would be a very difficult task to change the habits of this\r\nexcited and savage people, and to teach them the arts of peace, he\r\nlooked to the gods for help, and by sacrifices, processions, and choral\r\ndances, which he himself organised and arranged, he awed, interested,\r\nand softened the manners of the Romans, artfully beguiling them out of\r\ntheir warlike ferocity. Sometimes he spoke of supernatural terrors, evil\r\nomens, and unpropitious voices, so as to influence them by means of\r\nsuperstition. These measures proved his wisdom, and showed him a true\r\ndisciple of Pythagoras, for the worship of the gods was an important\r\npart of his state policy, as it is of Pythagoras's system of philosophy.\r\nHis love of outward show and stratagem was also said to be derived from\r\nPythagoras, for as the latter tamed an eagle and made it alight upon\r\nhim, and when walking through the crowd at Olympia showed his golden\r\nthigh, and did all the other surprising devices which made Timon of\r\nPhlius write the epigram--\r\n\r\n    \"Pythagoras by magic arts,\r\n    And mystic talk deludes men's hearts,\"\r\n\r\nso did Numa invent the story of his amour with a wood-nymph and his\r\nsecret converse with her, and of his enjoying the society of the Muses.\r\nHe referred most of his prophetic utterances to the Muses, and taught\r\nthe Romans to worship one of them especially, whom he called Tacita,\r\nwhich means silent or dumb. This seems to have been done in imitation of\r\nPythagoras, who especially revered silence. His legislation about images\r\nwas also connected with the Pythagorean doctrine, which says that first\r\nprinciples cannot be touched or seen, but are invisible spiritual\r\nessences; for Numa forbade the Romans to worship any likenesses of men\r\nor of beasts. Among them there was no image of a god, either carved or\r\nmoulded, in the early times. For a hundred and seventy years they built\r\ntemples, and placed shrines in them, but made no image of any living\r\nthing, considering that it was wrong to make the worse like the better,\r\nand that God cannot be comprehended otherwise than by thought. Their\r\nsacrifices also were connected with the Pythagorean doctrine; they were\r\nfor the most part bloodless, and performed with flour, libations of\r\nwine, and all the commonest things. But besides these, there are other\r\ndistinct proofs of the connection of these two men with one another. One\r\nof these is that the Romans enrolled Pythagoras as a citizen, as we are\r\ntold by Epicharmus the comic poet, in a letter which he wrote to\r\nAntenor. He was a man who lived in old times and underwent the\r\nPythagorean training. Another proof is that of his four sons, King Numa\r\nnamed one Mamercus after the son of Pythagoras; from whom sprung the\r\nancient patrician house of the Aemilii. This name was originally given\r\nhim in sport by the king, who used to call him _aimulos_ or wily. I\r\nmyself have heard many Romans narrate that an oracle once bade the\r\nRomans establish the wisest and the bravest of the Greeks in their own\r\ncity, and that in consequence of it they set up two brazen statues in\r\nthe Forum, one of Alkibiades and one of Pythagoras. But all this can be\r\nso easily disputed that it is not worth while to pursue it farther or to\r\nput any trust in it.\r\n\r\nIX. To Numa also is referred the institution of the Pontifices, or high\r\npriests; and he himself is said to have been one of the first. The\r\nPontifices are so called, according to some authorities, because they\r\nworship the gods, who are powerful and almighty; for powerful in Latin\r\nis _potens_. Others say that it refers to an exception made in favour of\r\npossibilities, meaning that the legislator ordered the priests to\r\nperform what services lay in their power, and did not deny that there\r\nare some which they cannot. But the most usually received and most\r\nabsurd derivation is that the word means nothing more than bridge\r\nbuilders, and that they were so named from the sacrifices which are\r\noffered upon the sacred bridge, which are of great sanctity and\r\nantiquity. The Latins call a bridge _pontem_. This bridge is intrusted\r\nto the care of the priests, like any other immovable holy relic; for the\r\nRomans think that the removal of the wooden bridge would call down the\r\nwrath of Heaven. It is said to be entirely composed of wood, in\r\naccordance with some oracle, without any iron whatever.\r\n\r\nThe stone bridge was built many years afterwards, when Aemilius was\r\nQuaestor. However, it is said that the wooden bridge itself does not\r\ndate from the time of Numa, but that it was finished by Marcius, the\r\ngrandson of Numa, when he was king.\r\n\r\nThe chief priest, or Pontifex Maximus, is an interpreter and prophet or\r\nrather expounder of the will of Heaven. He not only sees that the public\r\nsacrifices are properly conducted, but even watches those who offer\r\nprivate sacrifices, opposes all departure from established custom, and\r\npoints out to each man how to honour the gods and how to pray to them.\r\nHe also presides over the holy maidens called vestals.\r\n\r\nThe consecration of the vestal virgins, and the worship and watching of\r\nthe eternal flame by them, are entirely attributed to Numa, and\r\nexplained either by the pure and uncorruptible essence of fire being\r\nintrusted to the keeping of those who are stainless and undefiled, or\r\nby that which is barren and without fruit being associated with maidens.\r\n\r\nIndeed, in Greece, wherever an eternal fire is kept up, as at Delphi and\r\nAthens, it is not maidens, but widows, past the age to wed, that tend\r\nit. When any of these fires chance to go out, as, for instance, the\r\nsacred lamp went out at Athens when Aristion was despot, and the fire\r\nwent out at Delphi when the temple was burned by the Persians, and at\r\nRome in the revolutions during the time of the wars with King\r\nMithridates the fire, and even the altar upon which it burned, was swept\r\naway; then they say that it must not be lighted from another fire, but\r\nthat an entirely new fire must be made, lighted by a pure and undefiled\r\nray from the sun. They usually light it with mirrors made by hollowing\r\nthe surface of an isosceles right-angled triangle, which conducts all\r\nthe rays of light into one point. Now when it is placed opposite to the\r\nsun, so that all the rays coming from all quarters are collected\r\ntogether into that point, the ray thus formed passes through the thin\r\nair, and at once lights the dryest and lightest of the objects against\r\nwhich it strikes, for that ray has the strength and force of fire\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nSome say that the only duty of the vestal virgins is to watch that\r\neternal fire, but others say they perform certain secret rites, about\r\nwhich we have written as much as it is lawful to divulge, in the Life of\r\nCamillus.\r\n\r\nX. The first maidens who were consecrated by Numa were named Gegania and\r\nVerenia; and afterwards Canuleia and Tarpeia were added. Servius\r\nsubsequently added two more to their number, which has remained six ever\r\nsince his reign. Numa ordained that the maidens should observe celibacy\r\nfor thirty years, during the first ten years of which they were to learn\r\ntheir duties, during the next perform them, and during the last to teach\r\nothers. After this period any of them who wished might marry and cease\r\nto be priestesses; but it is said that very few availed themselves of\r\nthis privilege, and that those few were not happy, but, by their regrets\r\nand sorrow for the life they had left, made the others scruple to leave\r\nit, prefer to remain virgins till their death. They had great\r\nprivileges, such as that of disposing of their property by will when\r\ntheir fathers were still alive, like women who have borne three\r\nchildren. When they walk abroad they are escorted by lictors with the\r\nfasces; and if they happen to meet any criminal who is being taken to\r\nexecution, he is not put to death; but the vestal must swear that she\r\nmet him accidentally, and not on purpose. When they use a litter, no one\r\nmay pass under it on pain of death. The vestals are corrected by stripes\r\nfor any faults which they commit, sometimes by the Pontifex Maximus, who\r\nflogs the culprit without her clothes, but with a curtain drawn before\r\nher. She that breaks her vow of celibacy is buried alive at the Colline\r\nGate, at which there is a mound of earth which stretches some way inside\r\nthe city wall. In it they construct an underground chamber, of small\r\nsize, which is entered from above. In it is a bed with bedding, and a\r\nlamp burning; and also some small means of supporting life, such as\r\nbread, a little water in a vessel, milk, and oil, as though they wished\r\nto avoid the pollution of one who had been consecrated with such holy\r\nceremonies dying of hunger. The guilty one is placed in a litter,\r\ncovered in, and gagged with thongs so that she cannot utter a sound.\r\nThen they carry her through the Forum. All make way in silence, and\r\naccompany her passage with downcast looks, without speaking. There is no\r\nmore fearful sight than this, nor any day when the city is plunged into\r\ndeeper mourning. When the litter reaches the appointed spot, the\r\nservants loose her bonds, and the chief priest, after private prayer and\r\nlifting his hands to Heaven before his dreadful duty, leads her out,\r\nclosely veiled, places her upon a ladder which leads down into the\r\nsubterranean chamber. After this he turns away with the other priests;\r\nthe ladder is drawn up after she has descended, and the site of the\r\nchamber is obliterated by masses of earth which are piled upon it, so\r\nthat the place looks like any other part of the mound. Thus are the\r\nvestals punished who lose their chastity.\r\n\r\nXI. Numa is said to have built the Temple of Vesta, which was to contain\r\nthe sacred fire, in a circular form, imitating thereby not the shape of\r\nthe earth, but that of the entire universe, in the midst of which the\r\nPythagoreans place the element of fire, which they call Vesta and the\r\nUnit. The earth they say is not motionless, and not in the centre of its\r\norbit, but revolves round the central fire, occupying by no means the\r\nfirst or the most honourable place in the system of the universe. These\r\nideas are said to have been entertained by Plato also in his old age;\r\nfor he too thought that the earth was in a subordinate position, and\r\nthat the centre of the universe was occupied by some nobler body.\r\n\r\nXII. The Pontifices also explain, to those who inquire of them, the\r\nproper ceremonies at funerals. For Numa taught them not to think that\r\nthere was any pollution in death, but that we must pay due honours to\r\nthe gods below, because they will receive all that is noblest on earth.\r\nEspecially he taught them to honour the goddess Libitina, the goddess\r\nwho presides over funeral rites, whether she be Proserpine, or rather\r\nVenus, as the most learned Romans imagine, not unnaturally referring our\r\nbirth and our death to the same divinity.\r\n\r\nHe also defined the periods of mourning, according to the age of the\r\ndeceased. He allowed none for a child under three years of age, and for\r\none older the mourning was only to last as many months as he lived\r\nyears, provided those were not more than ten. The longest mourning was\r\nnot to continue above ten months, after which space widows were\r\npermitted to marry again; but she that took another husband before that\r\nterm was out was obliged by his decree to sacrifice a cow with calf.\r\n\r\nOf Numa's many other institutions I shall only mention two, that of the\r\nSalii and of the Feciales, which especially show his love of justice.\r\nThe Feciales are, as it were, guardians of peace, and in my opinion\r\nobtain their name from their office; for they were to act as mediators,\r\nand not to permit an appeal to arms before all hope of obtaining justice\r\nby fair means had been lost. The Greeks call it peace when two states\r\nsettle their differences by negotiation and not by arms; and the Roman\r\nFeciales frequently went to states that had done wrong and begged them\r\nto think better of what they had done. If they rejected their offers,\r\nthen the Feciales called the gods to witness, invoked dreadful curses\r\nupon themselves and their country, if they were about to fight in an\r\nunjust cause, and so declared war. Against the will of the Feciales, or\r\nwithout their approval, no Roman, whether king or common soldier, was\r\nallowed to take up arms, but the general was obliged first to have it\r\ncertified to him by the Feciales that the right was on his side, and\r\nthen to take his measures for a campaign. It is said that the great\r\ndisaster with the Gauls befell the city in consequence of this ceremony\r\nhaving been neglected. The barbarians were besieging Clusium; Fabius\r\nAmbustus was sent as an ambassador to their camp to make terms on behalf\r\nof the besieged. His proposals met with a harsh reply, and he, thinking\r\nthat his mission was at an end, had the audacity to appear before the\r\nranks of the men of Clusium in arms, and to challenge the bravest of the\r\nbarbarians to single combat. He won the fight, slew his opponent and\r\nstripped his body; but the Gauls recognised him, and sent a herald to\r\nRome, complaining that Fabius had broken faith and not kept his word,\r\nand had waged war against them without its being previously declared.\r\nHereupon the Feciales urged the Senate to deliver the man up to the\r\nGauls, but he appealed to the people, and by their favour escaped his\r\njust doom. Soon after the Gauls came and sacked Rome, except the\r\nCapitol. But this is treated of more at length in the 'Life of\r\nCamillus.'\r\n\r\nXIII. The priests called Salii are said to owe their origin to the\r\nfollowing circumstances: In the eighth year of Numa's reign an epidemic\r\nraged throughout Italy, and afflicted the city of Rome. Now amidst the\r\ngeneral distress it is related that a brazen shield fell from heaven\r\ninto the hands of Numa. Upon this the king made an inspired speech,\r\nwhich he had learned from Egeria and the Muses. The shield, he said,\r\ncame for the salvation of the city, and they must guard it, and make\r\neleven more like it, so that no thief could steal the one that fell from\r\nheaven, because he could not tell which it was. Moreover the place and\r\nthe meadows round about it, where he was wont to converse with the\r\nMuses, must be consecrated to them, and the well by which it was watered\r\nmust be pointed out as holy water to the vestal virgins, that they might\r\ndaily take some thence to purify and sprinkle their temple. The truth\r\nof this is said to have been proved by the immediate cessation of the\r\nplague. He bade workmen compete in imitating the shield, and, when all\r\nothers refused to attempt it, Veturius Mamurius, one of the best workmen\r\nof the time, produced so admirable an imitation, and made all the\r\nshields so exactly alike, that even Numa himself could not tell which\r\nwas the original. He next appointed the Salii to guard and keep them.\r\nThese priests were called Salii, not, as some say, after a man of\r\nSamothrace or of Mantinea named Salius, who first taught the art of\r\ndancing under arms, but rather from the springing dance itself, which\r\nthey dance through the city when they carry out the shields in the month\r\nof March, dressed in scarlet tunics, girt with brazen girdles, with\r\nbrazen helmets on their heads and little daggers with which they strike\r\nthe shields. The rest of their dance is done with their feet; they move\r\ngracefully, whirling round, swiftly and airily counter-changing their\r\npositions with light and vigorous motions according to rhythm and\r\nmeasure. The shields are called _ancilia_, because of their shape; for\r\nthey are not round, nor with a perfect circumference, but are cut out of\r\na wavy line, and curl in at the thickest part towards each other; or\r\nthey may be called _ancilia_ after the name of the elbow, _ankon_, on\r\nwhich they are carried; at least so Juba conjectures in his endeavours\r\nto find a Greek derivation for the word. The name may be connected with\r\nthe fall of the shield _from above_ (_anekathen_), or with the healing\r\n(_akesis_) of the plague, and the cessation of that terrible calamity,\r\nif we must refer the word to a Greek root.\r\n\r\nIt is related that, to reward Mamurius for his workmanship, his name is\r\nmentioned in the song which the Salii sing while they dance their\r\nPyrrhic dance; others, however, say that it is not Veturium Mamurium\r\nthat they say, but _Veterem Memoriam_, which means ancient memory.\r\n\r\nXIV. After he had arranged all religious ceremonies, he built, near the\r\ntemple of Vesta, the Regia, as a kind of royal palace; and there he\r\nspent most of his time, engaged in religious duties, instructing the\r\npriests, or awaiting some divine colloquy. He had also another house on\r\nthe hill of Quirinus, the site of which is even now pointed out.\r\n\r\nIn all religious processions through the city the heralds went first to\r\nbid the people cease their work, and attend to the ceremony; for just as\r\nthe Pythagoreans are said to forbid the worship of the gods in a cursory\r\nmanner, and to insist that men shall set out from their homes with this\r\npurpose and none other in their minds, so Numa thought it wrong that the\r\ncitizens should see or hear any religious ceremony in a careless,\r\nhalf-hearted manner, and made them cease from all worldly cares and\r\nattend with all their hearts to the most important of all duties,\r\nreligion; so he cleared the streets of all the hammering, and cries, and\r\nnoises which attend the practice of ordinary trades and handicrafts,\r\nbefore any holy ceremony. Some trace of this custom still survives in\r\nthe practice of crying out _Hoc age_ when the consul is taking the\r\nauspices or making a sacrifice. These words mean \"Do this thing,\" and\r\nare used to make the bystanders orderly and attentive. Many of his other\r\nprecepts are like those of the Pythagoreans; for just as they forbid men\r\nto sit upon a quart measure, or to stir the fire with a sword, or to\r\nturn back when they set out upon a journey, and bid them sacrifice an\r\nodd number to the gods above, and an even one to those below, all of\r\nwhich things had a mystical meaning, which was hidden from the common\r\nmass of mankind, so also some of Numa's rites can only be explained by\r\nreference to some secret legend, such as his forbidding men to make a\r\nlibation to the gods with wine made from an unpruned vine, and his\r\nordering that no sacrifice should be made without flour, and that men\r\nshould turn round while worshipping and sit after they had worshipped.\r\nThe first two of these seem to point to cultivation of the fruits of the\r\nearth, as a part of righteousness; the turning round of the worshippers\r\nis said to be in imitation of the revolution of the globe, but it seems\r\nmore probable that, as all temples look towards the east, the worshipper\r\nwho enters with his back to the sun turns round towards this god also,\r\nand begs of them both, as he makes his circuit, to fulfil his prayer.\r\nUnless indeed there is an allusion to the symbolical wheel of the\r\nEgyptians, and the change of posture means that nothing human is\r\nconstant, and that, however God may turn about our lives, it is our duty\r\nto be content. The act of sitting after prayer was said to portend that\r\nsuch as were good would obtain a solid and lasting fulfilment of their\r\nprayers. Or again, this attitude of rest marks the division between\r\ndifferent periods of prayer; so that after the end of one prayer they\r\nseat themselves in the presence of the gods, in order that under their\r\nauspices they may begin the next. This fully agrees with what has been\r\nsaid above, and shows that the lawgiver intended to accustom his\r\ncountrymen not to offer their prayers in a hurry, or in the intervals of\r\ndoing something else, but when they were at leisure and not pressed for\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nXV. By this religious training the city became so easily managed by\r\nNuma, and so impressed by his power, as to believe stories of the\r\nwildest character about him, and to think nothing incredible or\r\nimpossible if he wished to do it. For instance, it is related that once\r\nhe invited many of the citizens to dine with him, and placed before them\r\ncommon vessels and poor fare; but, as they were about to begin dinner,\r\nhe suddenly said that his familiar goddess was about to visit him, and\r\nat once displayed abundance of golden cups and tables covered with\r\ncostly delicacies. The strangest story of all is that of his\r\nconversation with Jupiter. The legend runs that Mount Aventine was not\r\nat this time enclosed within the city, but was full of fountains and\r\nshady glens, and haunted by two divinities, Picus and Faunus, who may be\r\ncompared to Satyrs or to Pan, and who, in knowledge of herbs and magic,\r\nseem equal to what the Greeks call the Daktyli of Mount Ida. These\r\ncreatures roamed about Italy playing their tricks, but Numa caught them\r\nby filling the spring at which they drank with wine and honey. They\r\nturned into all kinds of shapes, and assumed strange and terrible forms,\r\nbut when they found that they were unable to escape, they told Numa much\r\nof the future, and showed him how to make a charm against thunder-bolts,\r\nwhich is used to this day, and is made of onions and hair and sprats.\r\nSome say that it was not these deities who told him the charm, but that\r\nthey by magic arts brought down Jupiter from heaven, and he, in a rage,\r\nordered Numa to make the charm of \"Heads\"; and when Numa added, \"Of\r\nonions,\" he said \"Of men's\"--\"Hair,\" said Numa, again taking away the\r\nterrible part of the imprecation. When then Jupiter said \"With\r\nliving\"--\"Sprats,\" said Numa, answering as Egeria had taught him. The\r\ngod went away appeased, and the place was in consequence called Ilicius.\r\nThis was how the charm was discovered.\r\n\r\nThese ridiculous legends show the way in which the people had become\r\naccustomed to regard the gods. Indeed Numa is said to have placed all\r\nhis hopes in religion, to such an extent that even when a message was\r\nbrought him, saying, \"The enemy are approaching,\" he smiled and said,\r\n\"And I am sacrificing.\"\r\n\r\nXVI. The first temples that he founded are said to have been those of\r\nFides or Faith, and Terminus. Fides is said to have revealed to the\r\nRomans the greatest of all oaths, which they even now make use of; while\r\nTerminus is the god of boundaries, to whom they sacrifice publicly, and\r\nalso privately at the divisions of men's estates; at the present time\r\nwith living victims, but in old days this was a bloodless sacrifice, for\r\nNuma argued that the god of boundaries must be a lover of peace, and a\r\nwitness of righteousness, and therefore averse to bloodshed.\r\n\r\nIndeed Numa was the first king who defined the boundaries of the\r\ncountry, since Romulus was unwilling, by measuring what was really his\r\nown, to show how much he had taken from other states: for boundaries, if\r\npreserved, are barriers against violence; if disregarded, they become\r\nstanding proofs of lawless injustice. The city had originally but a\r\nsmall territory of its own, and Romulus gained the greater part of its\r\npossessions by the sword. All this Numa distributed among the needy\r\ncitizens, thereby removing the want which urged them to deeds of\r\nviolence, and, by turning the people's thoughts to husbandry, he made\r\nthem grow more civilised as their land grew more cultivated. No\r\nprofession makes men such passionate lovers of peace as that of a man\r\nwho farms his own land; for he retains enough of the warlike spirit to\r\nfight fiercely in defence of his own property, but has lost all desire\r\nto despoil and wrong his neighbours. It was for this reason that Numa\r\nencouraged agriculture among the Romans, as a spell to charm away war,\r\nand loved the art more because of its influence on men's minds than\r\nbecause of the wealth which it produced. He divided the whole country\r\ninto districts, which he called pagi, and appointed a head man for\r\neach, and a patrol to guard it. And sometimes he himself would inspect\r\nthem, and, forming an opinion of each man's character from the condition\r\nof his farm, would raise some to honours and offices of trust, and\r\nblaming others for their remissness, would lead them to do better in\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nXVII. Of his other political measures, that which is most admired is his\r\ndivision of the populace according to their trades. For whereas the\r\ncity, as has been said, originally consisted of two races, which stood\r\naloof one from the other and would not combine into one, which led to\r\nendless quarrels and rivalries, Numa, reflecting that substances which\r\nare hard and difficult to combine together, can nevertheless be mixed\r\nand formed into one mass if they are broken up into small pieces,\r\nbecause then they more easily fit into each other, determined to divide\r\nthe whole mass of the people of Rome into many classes, and thus, by\r\ncreating numerous petty rivalries, to obliterate their original and\r\ngreatest cause of variance.\r\n\r\nHis division was according to their trades, and consisted of the\r\nmusicians, the goldsmiths, the builders, the dyers, the shoemakers, the\r\ncarriers, the coppersmiths, and the potters. All the other trades he\r\nunited into one guild. He assigned to each trade its special privileges,\r\ncommon to all the members, and arranged that each should have its own\r\ntimes of meeting, and worship its own special patron god, and by this\r\nmeans he did away with that habit, which hitherto had prevailed among\r\nthe citizens, of some calling themselves Sabines, and some Romans; one\r\nboasting that they were Tatius's men, and other Romulus's. So this\r\ndivision produced a complete fusion and unity. Moreover he has been much\r\npraised for another of his measures, that, namely, of correcting the old\r\nlaw which allows fathers to sell their sons for slaves. He abolished\r\nthis power in the case of married men, who had married with their\r\nfather's consent; for he thought it a monstrous injustice that a woman,\r\nwho had married a free man, should be compelled to be the wife of a\r\nslave.\r\n\r\nXVIII. He also dealt with astronomical matters, not with perfect\r\naccuracy, and yet not altogether without knowledge. During the reign of\r\nRomulus the months had been in a state of great disorder, some not\r\ncontaining twenty days, some five-and-thirty, and some even more,\r\nbecause the Romans could not reconcile the discrepancies which arise\r\nfrom reckoning by the sun and the moon, and only insisted upon one\r\nthing, that the year should consist of three hundred and sixty days.\r\n\r\nNuma reckoned the variation to consist of eleven days, as the lunar year\r\ncontains three hundred and fifty-four days, and the solar year three\r\nhundred and sixty-five. He doubled these eleven days and introduced them\r\nevery other year, after February, as an intercalary month, twenty-two\r\ndays in duration, which was called by the Romans Mercedinus. This was a\r\nremedy for the irregularities of the calendar which itself required more\r\nextensive remedies.\r\n\r\nHe also altered the order of the months, putting March, which used to be\r\nthe first month, third, and making January the first, which in the time\r\nof Romulus had been the eleventh, and February the second, which then\r\nhad been the twelfth. There are many writers who say that these months,\r\nJanuary and February, were added to the calendar by Numa, and that\r\noriginally there had only been ten months in the year, just as some\r\nbarbarians have three, and in Greece the Arcadians have four, and the\r\nAcarnanians six. The Egyptians originally had but one month in their\r\nyear, and afterwards are said to have divided it into four mouths;\r\nwherefore, though they live in the newest of all countries, they appear\r\nto be the most ancient of all nations, and in their genealogies reckon\r\nan incredible number of years, because they count their months as years.\r\n\r\nXIX. One proof that the Romans used to reckon ten months and not twelve\r\nin the year is the name of the last month; for up to the present day it\r\nis called _December_, the tenth, and the order of the months shows that\r\nMarch was the first, for the fifth month from it they called\r\n_Quintilis_, the fifth; and the sixth month Sextilis, and so on for the\r\nothers, although, by their putting January and February before March, it\r\nresulted that the month which they number fifth is really seventh in\r\norder. Moreover, there is a legend that the month of March, being the\r\nfirst, was dedicated by Romulus to Mars, and the second, April, to\r\nAphrodité (Venus); in which month they sacrifice to this goddess, and\r\nthe women bathe on the first day of it crowned with myrtle. Some,\r\nhowever, say that April is not named after Aphrodité, because the word\r\nApril does not contain the letter _h_, and that it comes from the Latin\r\nword _aperio_, and means the month in which the spring-time opens the\r\nbuds of plants; for that is what the word signifies. Of the following\r\nmonths, May is named after Maia, the mother of Hermes or Mercury, for it\r\nis dedicated to her, and June from Juno. Some say that these names\r\nsignify old age and youth, for old men are called by the Latins majores,\r\nand young men juniores. The remaining months they named, from the order\r\nin which they came, the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth:\r\nQuintilis, Sextilis, September, October, November, December. Then\r\nQuintilis was called Julius after Julius Caesar, who conquered Pompeius;\r\nand Sextilis was called Augustus, after the second of the Roman\r\nEmperors. The next two months Domitian altered to his own titles, but\r\nnot for any long time, as after his death they resumed their old names\r\nof September and October. The last two alone have preserved their\r\noriginal names without change. Of the months, added or altered by Numa,\r\nFebruarius means the month of purification, for that is as nearly as\r\npossible the meaning of the word, and during it they sacrifice to the\r\ndead, and hold the festival of the Lupercalia, which resembles a\r\nceremony of purification. The first month, Januarius, is named after\r\nJanus. My opinion is, that Numa moved the month named after Mars from\r\nits precedence, wishing the art of good government to be honoured before\r\nthat of war. For Janus in very ancient times was either a deity or a\r\nking, who established a social polity, and made men cease from a savage\r\nlife like that of wild beasts. And for this reason his statues are made\r\nwith a double face, because he turned men's way of life from one form to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nXX. There is a temple to him in Rome, which has two doors, and which\r\nthey call the gate of war. It is the custom to open the temple in time\r\nof war, and to close it during peace. This scarcely ever took place, as\r\nthe empire was almost always at war with some state, being by its very\r\ngreatness continually brought into collision with the neighbouring\r\ntribes. Only in the time of Caesar Augustus, after he had conquered\r\nAntonius, it was closed; and before that, during the consulship of\r\nMarcus Atilius and Titus Manlius, for a short time, and then was almost\r\nimmediately reopened, as a new war broke out. But during Numa's reign no\r\none saw it open for a single day, and it remained closed for forty-three\r\nyears continuously, so utterly had he made wars to cease on all sides.\r\nNot only was the spirit of the Romans subdued and pacified by the gentle\r\nand just character of their king, but even the neighbouring cities, as\r\nif some soothing healthful air was breathed over them from Rome, altered\r\ntheir habits and longed to live quiet and well-governed, cultivating the\r\nearth, bringing up their families in peace, and worshipping the gods.\r\nAnd gay festivals and entertainments, during which the people of the\r\nvarious states fearlessly mixed with one another, prevailed throughout\r\nItaly, for Numa's knowledge of all that was good and noble was shed\r\nabroad like water from a fountain, and the atmosphere of holy calm by\r\nwhich he was surrounded spread over all men. The very poets when they\r\nwrote of that peaceful time were unable to find adequate expressions for\r\nit, as one writes--\r\n\r\n    \"Across the shields are cobwebs laid,\r\n    Rust eats the lance and keen edged blade;\r\n    No more we hear the trumpets bray.\r\n    And from our eyes no more is slumber chased away.\"\r\n\r\nNo war, revolution, or political disturbance of any kind is recorded\r\nduring Numa's reign, neither was there any envy or hatred of him or any\r\nattempt by others to obtain the crown; but either fear of the gods who\r\nvisibly protected him, or reverence for his virtues, or the special\r\ngrace of Heaven, made men's lives innocent and untainted with evil, and\r\nformed a striking proof of the truth of what Plato said many years\r\nafterwards, that the only escape from misery for men is when by Divine\r\nProvidence philosophy is combined with royal power, and used to exalt\r\nvirtue over vice. Blessed indeed is the truly wise man, and blessed are\r\nthey who hear the words of his mouth. Indeed his people require no\r\nrestraints or punishments, but seeing a plain example of virtue in the\r\nlife of their chief, they themselves of their own accord reform their\r\nlives, and model them upon that gentle and blessed rule of love and just\r\ndealing one with another which it is the noblest work of politicians to\r\nestablish. He is most truly a king who can teach such lessons as these\r\nto his subjects, and Numa beyond all others seems to have clearly\r\ndiscerned this truth.\r\n\r\nXXI. Historians differ in their accounts of his wives and children. Some\r\nsay that he married Tatia alone, and was the father of one daughter\r\nonly, named Pompilia; but others, besides her, assign to him four sons,\r\nnamed Pompo, Pinus, Calpus, and Mamercus, from whom descended the four\r\nnoble families of the Pomponii, Pinarii, Calphurnii, and Mamerci, which\r\nfor this reason took the title of Rex, that is, king. Others again say\r\nthat these pedigrees were invented to flatter these families, and state\r\nthat the Pompilian family descends not from Tatia, but from Lucretia,\r\nwhom he married after he became king. All, however, agree that Pompilia\r\nmarried Marcius, the son of that Marcius who encouraged Numa to accept\r\nthe crown. This man accompanied Numa to Rome, was made a member of the\r\nSenate, and after Numa's death laid claim to the crown, but was worsted\r\nby Tullus Hostilius and made away with himself. His son Marcius, who\r\nmarried Pompilia, remained in Rome, and became the father of Ancus\r\nMarcius, who was king after Tullus Hostilius, and who was only five\r\nyears old when Numa died.\r\n\r\nWe are told by Piso that Numa died, not by a sudden death, but by slow\r\ndecay from sheer old age, having lived a little more than eighty years.\r\n\r\nXXII. He was enviable even in death, for all the friendly and allied\r\nnations assembled at his funeral with national offerings. The senators\r\nbore his bier, which was attended by the chief priests, while the crowd\r\nof men, women and children who were present, followed with such weeping\r\nand wailing, that one would have thought that, instead of an aged king,\r\neach man was about to bury his own dearest friend, who had died in the\r\nprime of life. At his own wish, it is said, the body was not burned, but\r\nplaced in two stone coffins and buried on the Janiculum Hill. One of\r\nthese contained his body, and the other the sacred books which he\r\nhimself had written, as Greek legislators write their laws upon tablets.\r\nDuring his life he had taught the priests the contents of these books,\r\nand their meaning and spirit, and ordered them to be buried with his\r\ncorpse, because it was right that holy mysteries should be contained,\r\nnot in soulless writings, but in the minds of living men. For the same\r\nreason they say that the Pythagoreans never reduced their maxims to\r\nwriting, but implanted them in the memories of worthy men; and when some\r\nof their difficult processes in geometry were divulged to some unworthy\r\nmen, they said that Heaven would mark its sense of the wickedness which\r\nhad been committed by some great public calamity; so that, as Numa's\r\nsystem so greatly resembled that of Pythagoras, we can easily pardon\r\nthose who endeavour to establish a connection between them.\r\n\r\nValerius of Antium says that twelve sacred books and twelve books of\r\nGreek philosophy were placed in the coffin. Four hundred years\r\nafterwards, when Publius Cornelius and Marcus Baebius were consuls, a\r\ngreat fall of rain took place, and the torrent washed away the earth and\r\nexposed the coffins. When the lids were removed, one of the coffins was\r\nseen by all men to be empty, and without any trace of a corpse in it;\r\nthe other contained the books, which were read by Petilius the praetor,\r\nwho reported to the Senate that in his opinion it was not right that\r\ntheir contents should be made known to the people, and they were\r\ntherefore carried to the Comitium and burned there.\r\n\r\nAll good and just men receive most praise after their death, because\r\ntheir unpopularity dies with them or even before them; but Numa's glory\r\nwas enhanced by the unhappy reigns of his successors. Of five kings who\r\nsucceeded him, the last was expelled and died an exile, and of the other\r\nfour, not one died a natural death, but three were murdered by\r\nconspirators, and Tullus Hostilius, who was king next after Numa, and\r\nwho derided and insulted his wise ordinances, especially those\r\nconnected with religion, as lazy and effeminate, and who urged the\r\npeople to take up arms, was cut down in the midst of his boastings by a\r\nterrible disease, and became subject to superstitious fears in no way\r\nresembling Numa's piety. His subjects were led to share these terrors,\r\nmore especially by the manner of his death, which is said to have been\r\nby the stroke of a thunderbolt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF NUMA WITH LYKURGUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Now that we have gone through the lives of Numa and Lykurgus, we must\r\nattempt, without being daunted by difficulties, to reconcile the points\r\nin which they appear to differ from each other. Much they appear to have\r\nhad in common, as, for example, their self-control, their piety, and\r\ntheir political and educational ability; and while the peculiar glory of\r\nNuma is his acceptance of the throne, that of Lykurgus is his\r\nabdication. Numa received it without having asked for it; Lykurgus when\r\nin full possession gave it up. Numa, though a private man and not even a\r\nRoman, was chosen by the Romans as their king; but Lykurgus from being a\r\nking reduced himself to a private station. It is honourable to obtain a\r\ncrown by righteousness, but it is also honourable to prefer\r\nrighteousness to a crown. Numa's virtue made him so celebrated that he\r\nwas judged worthy to be king, Lykurgus' made him so great that he did\r\nnot care to be king.\r\n\r\nAgain, like those who tune the strings of a lyre, Lykurgus drew tighter\r\nthe relaxed and licentious Sparta, while Numa merely slackened the\r\nhighly strung and warlike Rome, so that here Lykurgus had the more\r\ndifficult task. He had to persuade his countrymen, not to take off their\r\narmour and lay aside their swords, but to leave off using gold and\r\nsilver, and to lay aside costly hangings and furniture; he had not to\r\nmake them exchange wars for sacrifices and gay festivals, but to cease\r\nfrom feasts and drinking-parties, and work hard both in the field and in\r\nthe palaestra to train themselves for war.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Numa was able to effect his purpose without difficulty,\r\nand without any loss of popularity and respect; while Lykurgus was\r\nstruck and pelted, and in danger of his life, and even so could scarcely\r\ncarry out his reforms. Yet the genius of Numa was kindly and gentle,\r\nand so softened and changed the reckless fiery Romans that they became\r\npeaceful, law-abiding citizens; and if we must reckon Lykurgus'\r\ntreatment of the Helots as part of his system, it cannot be denied that\r\nNuma was a far more civilised lawgiver, seeing that he allowed even to\r\nactual slaves some taste of liberty, by his institution of feasting them\r\ntogether with their masters at the festival of Saturn.\r\n\r\nFor this custom of allowing the labourers to share in the harvest-feast\r\nis traced to Numa. Some say that this is in remembrance of the equality\r\nwhich existed in the time of Saturn, when there was neither master nor\r\nslave, but all were kinsmen and had equal rights.\r\n\r\nII. Both evidently encouraged the spirit of independence and\r\nself-control among their people, while of other virtues, Lykurgus loved\r\nbravery, and Numa loved justice best; unless indeed we should say that,\r\nfrom the very different temper and habits of the two states, they\r\nrequired to be treated in a different manner. It was not from cowardice,\r\nbut because he scorned to do an injustice, that Numa did not make war;\r\nwhile Lykurgus made his countrymen warlike, not in order that they might\r\ndo wrong, but that they might not be wronged. Each found that the\r\nexisting system required very important alterations to check its\r\nexcesses and supply its defects. Numa's reforms were all in favour of\r\nthe people, whom he classified into a mixed and motley multitude of\r\ngoldsmiths and musicians and cobblers; while the constitution introduced\r\nby Lykurgus was severely aristocratic, driving all handicrafts into the\r\nhands of slaves and foreigners, and confining the citizens to the use of\r\nthe spear and shield, as men whose trade was war alone, and who knew\r\nnothing but how to obey their leaders and to conquer their enemies. In\r\nSparta a free man was not permitted to make money in business, in order\r\nthat he might be truly free.\r\n\r\nEach thing connected with the business of making money, like that of\r\npreparing food for dinner, was left in the hands of slaves and helots.\r\nNuma made no regulations of this kind, but, while he put an end to\r\nmilitary plundering, raised no objection to other methods of making\r\nmoney, nor did he try to reduce inequalities of fortune, but allowed\r\nwealth to increase unchecked, and disregarded the influx of poor men\r\ninto the city and the increase of poverty there, whereas he ought at the\r\nvery outset, like Lykurgus, while men's fortunes were still tolerably\r\nequal, to have raised some barrier against the encroachments of wealth,\r\nand to have restrained the terrible evils which take their rise and\r\norigin in it. As for the division of the land among the citizens, in my\r\nopinion, Lykurgus cannot be blamed for doing it, nor yet can Numa for\r\nnot doing it. The equality thus produced was the very foundation and\r\ncorner-stone of the Lacedaemonian constitution, while Numa had no motive\r\nfor disturbing the Roman lands, which had only been recently distributed\r\namong the citizens, or to alter the arrangements made by Romulus, which\r\nwe may suppose were still in force throughout the country.\r\n\r\nIII. With regard to a community of wives and children, each took a wise\r\nand statesman-like course to prevent jealousy, although the means\r\nemployed by each were different. A Roman who possessed a sufficient\r\nfamily of his own might be prevailed upon by a friend who had no\r\nchildren to transfer his wife to him, being fully empowered to give her\r\naway, by divorce, for this purpose; but a Lacedaemonian was accustomed\r\nto lend his wife for intercourse with a friend, while she remained\r\nliving in his house, and without the marriage being thereby dissolved.\r\nMany, we are told, even invited those who, they thought, would beget\r\nfine and noble children, to converse with their wives. The distinction\r\nbetween the two customs seems to be this: the Spartans affected an\r\nunconcern and insensibility about a matter which excites most men to\r\nviolent rage and jealousy; the Romans modestly veiled it by a legal\r\ncontract which seems to admit how hard it is for a man to give up his\r\nwife to another. Moreover Numa's regulations about young girls were of a\r\nmuch more feminine and orderly nature, while those of Lykurgus were so\r\nhighflown and unbecoming to women, as to have been the subject of notice\r\nby the poets, who call them _Phainomerides_, that is with bare thighs,\r\nas Ibykus says; and they accuse them of lust, as Euripides says--\r\n\r\n    \"They stay not, as befits a maid, at home,\r\n    But with young men in shameless dresses roam.\"\r\n\r\nFor in truth the sides of the maiden's tunic were not fastened together\r\nat the skirt, and so flew open and exposed the thigh as they walked,\r\nwhich is most clearly alluded to in the lines of Sophokles--\r\n\r\n    \"She that wanders nigh,\r\n    With scanty skirt that shows the thigh,\r\n    A Spartan maiden fair and free,\r\n    Hermione.\"\r\n\r\nOn this account they are said to have become bolder than they should be,\r\nand to have first shown this spirit towards their husbands, ruling\r\nuncontrolled over their households, and afterwards in public matters,\r\nwhere they freely expressed their opinions upon the most important\r\nsubjects. On the other hand, Numa preserved that respect and honour due\r\nfrom men to matrons which they had met with under Romulus, who paid them\r\nthese honours to atone for having carried them off by force, but he\r\nimplanted in them habits of modesty, sobriety, and silence, forbidding\r\nthem even to touch wine, or to speak even when necessary except in their\r\nhusbands' presence. It is stated that once, because a woman pleaded her\r\nown cause in the Forum, the Senate sent to ask the oracle what this\r\nstrange event might portend for the state.\r\n\r\nA great proof of the obedience and modesty of the most part of them is\r\nthe way in which the names of those who did any wrong is remembered.\r\nFor, just as in Greece, historians record the names of those who first\r\nmade war against their own kindred or murdered their parents, so the\r\nRomans tell us that the first man who put away his wife was Spurius\r\nCarvilius, nothing of the kind having happened in Rome for two hundred\r\nand thirty years from its foundation; and that the wife of Pinarius,\r\nThalaea by name, was the first to quarrel with her mother-in-law Gegania\r\nin the reign of Tarquinius Superbus--so well and orderly were marriages\r\narranged by this lawgiver.\r\n\r\nIV. The rest of their laws for the training and marriage of maidens\r\nagree with one another, although Lykurgus put off the time of marriage\r\ntill they were full-grown, in order that their intercourse, demanded as\r\nit was by nature, might produce love and friendship in the married pair\r\nrather than the dislike often experienced by an immature child towards\r\nher husband, and also that their bodies might be better able to support\r\nthe trials of child-bearing, which he regarded as the sole object of\r\nmarriage; whereas the Romans gave their daughters in marriage at the age\r\nof twelve years or even younger, thinking thus to hand over a girl to\r\nher husband pure and uncorrupt both in body and mind. It is clear that\r\nthe former system is best for the mere production of children, and the\r\nlatter for moulding consorts for life. But by his superintendence of the\r\nyoung, his collecting them into companies, his training and drill, with\r\nthe table and exercises common to all, Lykurgus showed that he was\r\nimmensely superior to Numa, who, like any commonplace lawgiver, left the\r\nwhole training of the young in the hands of their fathers, regulated\r\nonly by their caprice or needs; so that whoever chose might bring up his\r\nson as a shipwright, a coppersmith, or a musician, as though the\r\ncitizens ought not from the very outset to direct their attention to one\r\nobject, but were like people who have embarked in the same ship for\r\nvarious causes, who only in time of danger act together for the common\r\nadvantage of all, and at other times pursue each his own private ends.\r\nAllowance must be made for ordinary lawgivers, who fail through want of\r\npower or of knowledge in establishing such a system; but no such excuse\r\ncan be made for Numa, who was a wise man, and who was made king of a\r\nnewly-created state which would not have opposed any of his designs.\r\nWhat could be of greater importance than to regulate the education of\r\nthe young and so to train them that they might all become alike in their\r\nlives and all bear the same impress of virtue? It was to this that\r\nLykurgus owed the permanence of his laws; for he could not have trusted\r\nto the oaths which he made them take, if he had not by education and\r\ntraining so steeped the minds of the young in the spirit of his laws,\r\nand by his method of bringing them up implanted in them such a love for\r\nthe state, that the most important of his enactments remained in force\r\nfor more than five hundred years; for the lives of all Spartans seem to\r\nhave been coloured by these laws. That which was the aim and end of\r\nNuma's policy, that Rome should be at peace and friendly with her\r\nneighbours, ceased immediately upon his death; at once the double-gated\r\ntemple, which he kept closed as if he really kept war locked up in it,\r\nhad both its gates thrown open and filled Italy with slaughter. His\r\nexcellent and righteous policy did not last for a moment, for the people\r\nwere not educated to support it, and therefore it could not be lasting.\r\nBut, it may be asked, did not Rome flourish by her wars? It is hard to\r\nanswer such a question, in an age which values wealth, luxury, and\r\ndominion more than a gentle peaceful life that wrongs no one and\r\nsuffices for itself. Yet this fact seems to tell for Lykurgus, that the\r\nRomans gained such an enormous increase of power by departing from\r\nNuma's policy, while the Lacedaemonians, as soon as they fell away from\r\nthe discipline of Lykurgus, having been the haughtiest became the most\r\ncontemptible of Greeks, and not only lost their supremacy, but had even\r\nto struggle for their bare existence. On the other hand, it was truly\r\nglorious for Numa that he was a stranger and sent for by the Romans to\r\nbe their king; that he effected all his reforms without violence, and\r\nruled a city composed of discordant elements without any armed force\r\nsuch as Lykurgus had to assist him, winning over all men and reducing\r\nthem to order by his wisdom and justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF SOLON.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Didymus the grammarian, in the book about Solon's laws which he wrote\r\nin answer to Asklepiades, quotes a saying of one Philokles, that Solon\r\nwas the son of Euphorion, which is quite at variance with the testimony\r\nof all other writers who have mentioned Solon: for they all say that he\r\nwas the son of Exekestides, a man whose fortune and power were only\r\nmoderate, but whose family was of the noblest in Athens; for he was\r\ndescended from Kodrus the last Athenian king. Herakleides of Pontus\r\nrelates that the mother of Solon was first cousin to the mother of\r\nPeisistratus. The two boys, we are told, were friends when young, and\r\nwhen in after years they differed in politics they still never\r\nentertained harsh or angry feelings towards one another, but kept alive\r\nthe sacred flame of their former intimate friendship. Peisistratus is\r\neven said to have dedicated the statue of Love in the Academy where\r\nthose who are going to run in the sacred torch-race light their torches.\r\n\r\nII. According to Hermippus, Solon, finding that his father had by his\r\ngenerosity diminished his fortune, and feeling ashamed to be dependent\r\nupon others, when he himself was come of a house more accustomed to give\r\nthan to receive, embarked in trade, although his friends were eager to\r\nsupply him with all that he could wish for. Some, however, say that\r\nSolon travelled more with a view to gaining experience and learning than\r\nto making money. He was indeed eager to learn, as he wrote when an old\r\nman,\r\n\r\n    \"Old to grow, but ever learning,\"\r\n\r\nbut disregarded wealth, for he wrote that he regarded as equally rich\r\nthe man who owned\r\n\r\n    \"Gold and broad acres, corn and wine;\r\n    And he that hath but clothes and food,\r\n    A wife, and youthful strength divine.\"\r\n\r\nYet elsewhere he has written, but\r\n\r\n    \"I long for wealth, not by fraud obtained,\r\n    For curses wait on riches basely gained.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no reason for an upright statesman either to be over anxious\r\nfor luxuries or to despise necessaries. At that period, as Hesiod tells\r\nus, \"Work was no disgrace,\" nor did trade carry any reproach, while the\r\nprofession of travelling merchant was even honourable, as it civilised\r\nbarbarous tribes, and gained the friendship of kings, and learned much\r\nin many lands. Some merchants founded great cities, as, for example,\r\nProtis, who was beloved by the Gauls living near the Rhone, founded\r\nMarseilles. It is also said that Thales the sage, and Hippocrates the\r\nmathematician, travelled as merchants, and that Plato defrayed the\r\nexpenses of his journey to Egypt by the oil which he disposed of in that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIII. Solon's extravagance and luxurious mode of life, and his poems,\r\nwhich treat of pleasure more from a worldly than a philosophic point of\r\nview, are attributed to his mercantile training; for the great perils of\r\na merchant's life require to be paid in corresponding pleasures. Yet it\r\nis clear that he considered himself as belonging to the class of the\r\npoor, rather than that of the rich, from the following verses:\r\n\r\n    \"The base are rich, the good are poor; and yet\r\n      Our virtue for their gold we would not change;\r\n    For that at least is ours for evermore,\r\n      While wealth we see from hand to hand doth range.\"\r\n\r\nHis poetry was originally written merely for his own amusement in his\r\nleisure hours; but afterwards he introduced into it philosophic\r\nsentiments, and interwove political events with his poems, not in order\r\nto record them historically, but in some cases to explain his own\r\nconduct, and in others to instruct, encourage, or rebuke the Athenians.\r\nSome say that he endeavoured to throw his laws into an epic form, and\r\ntell us that the poem began--\r\n\r\n    \"To Jove I pray, great Saturn's son divine,\r\n    To grant his favour to these laws of mine.\"\r\n\r\nOf ethical philosophy, he, like most of the sages of antiquity, was most\r\ninterested in that branch which deals with political obligations. As to\r\nnatural science, his views are very crude and antiquated, as we see from\r\nthe following verses:\r\n\r\n    \"From clouds the snow and hail descend,\r\n    And thunderbolts the lightnings send;\r\n    The waves run high when gales do blow,\r\n    Without the wind they're still enow.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, of all the sages of that time, Thales alone seems to have known\r\nmore of physics than was necessary to supply man's every-day needs; all\r\nthe others having gained their reputation for political wisdom.\r\n\r\nIV. These wise men are said to have met at Delphi, and again at Corinth,\r\nwhere they were entertained by the despot Periander. Their reputation\r\nwas greatly increased by the tripod which was sent to all of them and\r\nrefused by all with a gracious rivalry. The story goes that some men of\r\nCos were casting a net, and some strangers from Miletus bought the haul\r\nof them before it reached the surface.\r\n\r\nThe net brought up a golden tripod, the same which, it is said, Helen\r\nthrew into the sea at that spot, in accordance with some ancient oracle,\r\nwhen she was sailing away from Troy. A dispute arose at first between\r\nthe strangers and the fishermen; afterwards it was taken up by their\r\nrespective cities, who even came to blows about it. Finally they\r\nconsulted the oracle at Delphi, which ordered it to be given to the\r\nwisest. Now it was first sent to Miletus, to Thales, as the men of Cos\r\nwillingly gave it to that one man, although they had fought with all the\r\nMilesians together about it. Thales said that Bias was wiser than\r\nhimself, and sent it to him; and by him it was again sent to another\r\nman, as being wiser yet. So it went on, being sent from one to another\r\nuntil it came to Thales a second time, and at last was sent from Miletus\r\nto Thebes and consecrated to Apollo Ismenius. As Theophrastus tells the\r\nstory, the tripod was first sent to Bias at Priéne, and secondly to\r\nThales at Miletus, and so on through all of the wise men until it again\r\nreached Bias, and was finally offered at Delphi. This is the more common\r\nversion of the story, although some say that it was not a tripod but a\r\nbowl sent by Croesus, others that it was a drinking-cup left behind by\r\none Bathykles.\r\n\r\nV. Anacharsis is said to have met Solon, and afterwards Thales in\r\nprivate, and to have conversed with them. The story goes that Anacharsis\r\ncame to Athens, went to Solon's door, and knocked, saying that he was a\r\nstranger and had come to enter into friendship with him. When Solon\r\nanswered that friendships were best made at home, Anacharsis said, \"Well\r\nthen, do you, who are at home, enter into friendship with me.\" Solon,\r\nadmiring the man's cleverness, received him kindly, and kept him for\r\nsome time in his house. He was at this time engaged in politics, and was\r\ncomposing his laws. Anacharsis, when he discovered this, laughed at\r\nSolon's undertaking, if he thought to restrain the crimes and greed of\r\nthe citizens by written laws, which he said were just like spiders'\r\nwebs; for, like them, they caught the weaker criminals, but were broken\r\nthrough by the stronger and more important.\r\n\r\nTo this Solon answered, that men keep covenants, because it is to the\r\nadvantage of neither party to break them; and that he so suited his laws\r\nto his countrymen, that it was to the advantage of every one to abide by\r\nthem rather than to break them. Nevertheless, things turned out more as\r\nAnacharsis thought than as Solon wished. Anacharsis said too, when\r\npresent at an assembly of the people, that he was surprised to see that\r\nin Greece wise men spoke upon public affairs, and ignorant men decided\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nVI. When Solon went to Thales at Miletus, he expressed his wonder at his\r\nhaving never married and had a family. Thales made no answer at the\r\ntime, but a few days afterwards arranged that a man should come to him\r\nand say that he left Athens ten days before. When Solon inquired of him,\r\nwhether anything new had happened at Athens, the man answered, as Thales\r\nhad instructed him, that \"there was no news, except the death of a\r\nyoung man who had been escorted to his grave by the whole city. He was\r\nthe son, they told him, of a leading citizen of great repute for his\r\ngoodness, but the father was not present, for they said he had been\r\ntravelling abroad for some years.\" \"Unhappy man,\" said Solon, \"what was\r\nhis name?\" \"I heard his name,\" answered the man, \"but I cannot remember\r\nit; beyond that there was much talk of his wisdom and justice.\" Thus by\r\neach of his answers he increased Solon's alarm, until he at last in his\r\nexcitement asked the stranger whether it were not Solon's son that was\r\ndead. The stranger said that it was. Solon was proceeding to beat his\r\nhead and show all the other marks of grief, when Thales stopped him,\r\nsaying with a smile, \"This, Solon, which has the power to strike down so\r\nstrong a man as you, has ever prevented my marrying and having children.\r\nBut be of good courage, for this tale which you have been told is\r\nuntrue.\" This story is said by Hermippus to have been told by Pataikos,\r\nhe who said that he had inherited the soul of Aesop.\r\n\r\nVII. It is a strange and unworthy feeling that prompts a man not to\r\nclaim that to which he has a right, for fear that he may one day lose\r\nit; for by the same reasoning he might refuse wealth, reputation, or\r\nwisdom, for fear of losing them hereafter. We see even virtue, the\r\ngreatest and most dear of all possessions, can be destroyed by disease\r\nor evil drugs; and Thales by avoiding marriage still had just as much to\r\nfear, unless indeed he ceased to love his friends, his kinsmen, and his\r\nnative land. But even he adopted his sister's son Kybisthus; for the\r\nsoul has a spring of affection within it, and is formed not only to\r\nperceive, to reflect, and to remember, but also to love. If it finds\r\nnothing to love at home, it will find something abroad; and when\r\naffection, like a desert spot, has no legitimate possessors, it is\r\nusurped by bastard children or even servants, who when they have\r\nobtained our love, make us fear for them and be anxious about them. So\r\nthat one may often see men, in a cynical temper, inveighing against\r\nmarriage and children, who themselves shortly afterwards will be plunged\r\ninto unmanly excesses of grief, at the loss of their child by some slave\r\nor concubine. Some have even shown terrible grief at the death of dogs\r\nand horses; whereas others, who have lost noble sons, made no unusual or\r\nunseemly exhibition of sorrow, but passed the remainder of their lives\r\ncalmly and composedly. Indeed it is weakness, not affection, which\r\nproduces such endless misery and dread to those who have not learned to\r\ntake a rational view of the uncertainty of life, and who cannot enjoy\r\nthe presence of their loved ones because of their constant agony for\r\nfear of losing them. We should not make ourselves poor for fear of\r\nlosing our property, nor should we guard ourselves against a possible\r\nloss of friends by making none; still less ought we to avoid having\r\nchildren for fear that our child might die. But we have already dwelt\r\ntoo much upon this subject.\r\n\r\nVIII. After a long and harassing war with the Megarians about the\r\npossession of the Island of Salamis, the Athenians finally gave up in\r\nsheer weariness, and passed a law forbidding any one for the future,\r\neither to speak or to write in favour of the Athenian claim to Salamis,\r\nupon pain of death. Solon, grieved at this dishonour, and observing that\r\nmany of the younger men were eager for an excuse to fight, but dared not\r\npropose to do so because of this law, pretended to have lost his reason.\r\nHis family gave out that he was insane, but he meanwhile composed a\r\npoem, and when he had learned it by heart, rushed out into the\r\nmarket-place wearing a small felt cap, and having assembled a crowd,\r\nmounted the herald's stone and recited the poem which begins with the\r\nlines--\r\n\r\n    \"A herald I from Salamis am come,\r\n    My verse will tell you what should there be done.\"\r\n\r\nThe name of this poem is Salamis; it consists of a hundred beautifully\r\nwritten lines. After he had sung it, his friends began to commend it,\r\nand Peisistratus made a speech to the people, which caused such\r\nenthusiasm that they abrogated the law and renewed the war, with Solon\r\nas their leader. The common version of the story runs thus: Solon sailed\r\nwith Peisistratus to Kolias, where he found all the women of the city\r\nperforming the customary sacrifice to Demeter (Ceres). At the same time,\r\nhe sent a trusty man to Salamis, who represented himself as a deserter,\r\nand bade the Megarians follow him at once to Kolias, if they wished to\r\ncapture all the women of the first Athenian families. The Megarians were\r\nduped, and sent off a force in a ship. As soon as Solon saw this ship\r\nsail away from the island, he ordered the women out of the way, dressed\r\nup those young men who were still beardless in their clothes,\r\nheaddresses, and shoes, gave them daggers, and ordered them to dance and\r\ndisport themselves near the seashore until the enemy landed, and their\r\nship was certain to be captured. So the Megarians, imagining them to be\r\nwomen, fell upon them, struggling which should first seize them, but\r\nthey were cut off to a man by the Athenians, who at once sailed to\r\nSalamis and captured it.\r\n\r\nIX. Others say that the island was not taken in this way, but that first\r\nof all Solon received the following oracular response from Apollo at\r\nDelphi:\r\n\r\n    \"Appease the land's true lords, the heroes blest,\r\n    Who near Asopia's fair margin rest,\r\n    And from their tombs still look towards the West.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this, Solon is said to have sailed by night, unnoticed by the\r\nMegarians, and to have sacrificed to the heroes Periphemus and Kychreus.\r\nHis next act was to raise five hundred Athenian volunteers, who by a\r\npublic decree were to be absolute masters of the island if they could\r\nconquer it. With these he set sail in a number of fishing-boats, with a\r\ntriaconter or ship of war of thirty oars, sailing in company, and\r\nanchored off a certain cape which stretches towards Euboea. The\r\nMegarians in Euboea heard an indistinct rumour of this, and at once ran\r\nto arms, and sent a ship to reconnoitre the enemy. This ship, when it\r\ncame near Solon's fleet, was captured and its crew taken prisoners. On\r\nboard of it Solon placed some picked men, and ordered them to make sail\r\nfor the city of Salamis, and to conceal themselves as far as they could.\r\nMeanwhile he with the remaining Athenians attacked the Megarian forces\r\nby land; and while the battle was at its hottest, the men in the ship\r\nsucceeded in surprising the city.\r\n\r\nThis story appears to be borne out by the proceedings which were\r\ninstituted in memory of the capture. In this ceremony an Athenian ship\r\nused to sail to Salamis, at first in silence, and then as they neared\r\nthe shore with warlike shouts. Then a man completely armed used to leap\r\nout and run, shouting as he went, up to the top of the hill called\r\nSkiradion, where he met those who came by land. Close by this place\r\nstands the temple of Ares, which Solon built; for he conquered the\r\nMegarians in the battle, and sent away the survivors with a flag of\r\ntruce.\r\n\r\nX. However, as the Megarians still continued the war, to the great\r\nmisery of both sides, they agreed to make the Lacedaemonians arbitrators\r\nand judges between them. Most writers say that Solon brought the great\r\nauthority of Homer's 'Iliad' to his aid, by interpolating in the\r\ncatologue of ships the two verses--\r\n\r\n    \"Ajax from Salamis twelve vessels good\r\n    Brought, and he placed them where the Athenians stood,\"\r\n\r\nwhich he had read as evidence before the court.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians, however, say that all this is nonsense, but that Solon\r\nproved to the arbitrators that Philaeus and Eurysakes, the sons of Ajax,\r\nwhen they were enrolled as Athenian citizens, made over the island to\r\nAthens, and dwelt, one at Brauron, in Attica, and the other at Melité;\r\nmoreover, there is an Athenian tribe which claims descent from Philaeus,\r\nto which Peisistratus belonged. Wishing, however, yet more thoroughly to\r\nprove his case against the Megarians, he based an argument on the tombs\r\nin the island, in which the corpses were buried, not in the Megarian,\r\nbut in the Athenian manner. For the Megarians bury their dead looking\r\ntowards the east, and the Athenians towards the west. But Hereas of\r\nMegara denies this, and says that the Megarians also bury their dead\r\nlooking towards the west, and moreover, that each Athenian had a coffin\r\nto himself, while the Megarians place two or three bodies in one coffin.\r\nHowever, Solon supported his case by quoting certain oracles from\r\nDelphi, in which the god addresses Salamis as Ionian. The Spartan\r\narbitrators were five in number, their names being Kritolaidas,\r\nAmompharetus, Hypsichidas, Anaxilos, and Kleomenes.\r\n\r\nXI. Solon's reputation and power were greatly increased by this, but he\r\nbecame much more celebrated and well-known in Greece by his speeches on\r\nbehalf of the temple at Delphi, in which he urged the necessity of\r\nchecking the insolent conduct of the people of Kirrha towards the\r\ntemple, and of rallying in defence of the god. The Amphiktyons,\r\nprevailed upon by his eloquence, declared war, as we learn from\r\nAristotle, among other writers, in his book about the winners of the\r\nprize at the Pythian games, in which he attributes this decision to\r\nSolon. However, he was not made general in that war, as Hermippus\r\nrelates, quoting from Evanthes of Samos; for Aeschines the orator does\r\nnot mention him, and, in the records of Delphi, Alkmaeon, not Solon, is\r\nmentioned as general of the Athenians on that occasion.\r\n\r\nXII. Athens had long been suffering from the anger of the gods, which it\r\nhad incurred by the treatment of Kylon's party. These conspirators took\r\nsanctuary in Athene's temple, but were induced by Megakles the archon to\r\nquit it and stand their trial. They fastened a thread to the shrine of\r\nthe goddess, and kept hold of it so as still to be under her protection.\r\nBut as they were coming down from the Acropolis, just beside the temple\r\nof the Furies, the string broke, and Megakles and the other archons,\r\nthinking that the goddess rejected their appeal, seized them. Some of\r\nthem were stoned to death outside the temple, and some who had fled for\r\nsanctuary to the altars were slain there. Only those who fell as\r\nsuppliants at the feet of the archons' wives were spared. After this the\r\narchons were called accursed, and were viewed with horror; moreover, the\r\nsurvivors of Kylon's party regained strength, and continued their\r\nintrigues against Megakles and the archons. At the time of which we are\r\nspeaking these dissensions had reached their height, and the city was\r\ndivided into two factions, when Solon, who was already a man of great\r\nreputation, came forward with some of the noblest Athenians, and by his\r\nentreaties and arguments prevailed upon those magistrates who were\r\ncalled accursed, to stand trial and be judged by a jury of three hundred\r\ncitizens selected from the best families. Myron of Phlya prosecuted, and\r\nthe archons were found guilty, and forced to leave the country. The\r\nbodies of such of them as had died were dug up, and cast out beyond the\r\nborders of Attica.\r\n\r\nDuring these disorders the Athenians were again attacked by the\r\nMegarians, and lost Nisaea, and were again driven out of Salamis. The\r\ncity was also a prey to superstitious terrors, and apparitions were\r\nseen, so that the prophets, after inspecting their victims, said that\r\nthe city was polluted and under a curse, and that it required\r\npurification. Upon this they sent for Epimenides the Phaestian, of\r\nCrete, who is reckoned among the seven wise men of Greece, by some of\r\nthose who do not admit Periander into their number. He was thought to\r\nenjoy the favour of Heaven, and was skilled in all the lore of the\r\nsacred mysteries, and in the sources of divine inspiration; wherefore he\r\nwas commonly reported to be the child of the nymph Balte, and to be one\r\nof the old Curetes of Crete revived. He came to Athens and was a friend\r\nto Solon, assisting him greatly in his legislation. He remodelled their\r\nreligious rites, and made their mourning more moderate, introducing\r\ncertain sacrifices shortly after the funeral, and abolishing the harsh\r\nand barbarous treatment which women were for the most part subject to\r\nbefore in times of mourning. Above all, by purifications and atoning\r\nsacrifices, and the erection of new temples, he so sanctified and\r\nhallowed the city as to make the minds of the people obedient to the\r\nlaws, and easily guided into unity and concord. It is said that he saw\r\nMunychia, and viewed it carefully for some time in silence. Then he said\r\nto the bystanders, \"How blind is man to the future. The Athenians would\r\neat this place up with their teeth if they knew what misfortunes it will\r\nbring upon them?\" A prophetic saying of the same kind is attributed to\r\nThales. He bade his friends bury him in a low and neglected quarter of\r\nMiletus, telling them that one day it would be the market-place of the\r\ncity. Epimenides was greatly honoured by the Athenians, and was offered\r\nlarge sums of money by them, and great privileges, but he refused them\r\nall, and only asked for a branch of the sacred olive-tree, which he\r\nreceived and went his way.\r\n\r\nXIII. When the troubles about Kylon were over, and the accursed men cast\r\nout of the country, the Athenians relapsed into their old dispute about\r\nthe constitution. The state was divided into as many factions as there\r\nwere parts of the country, for the Diakrii, or mountaineers, favoured\r\ndemocracy; the Pedioei, oligarchy; while those who dwelt along the\r\nseashore, called Parali, preferred a constitution midway between these\r\ntwo forms, and thus prevented either of the other parties from carrying\r\ntheir point. Moreover, the state was on the verge of revolution, because\r\nof the excessive poverty of some citizens, and the enormous wealth of\r\nothers, and it appeared that the only means of putting an end to these\r\ndisorders was by establishing an absolute despotism. The whole people\r\nwere in debt to a few wealthy men; they either cultivated their farms,\r\nin which case they were obliged to pay one-sixth of the profit to their\r\ncreditors, and were called Hektemori, or servants, or else they had\r\nraised loans upon personal security, and had become the slaves of their\r\ncreditors, who either employed them at home, or sold them to foreigners.\r\nMany were even compelled to sell their own children, which was not\r\nillegal, and to leave the country because of the harshness of their\r\ncreditors.\r\n\r\nThe greater part, and those of most spirit, combined together, and\r\nencouraged one another not to suffer such oppression any longer, but to\r\nchoose some trustworthy person to protect their interests, to set free\r\nall enslaved debtors, redistribute the land, and, in a word, entirely\r\nremodel the constitution.\r\n\r\nXIV. In this position of affairs, the most sensible men in Athens\r\nperceived that Solon was a person who shared the vices of neither\r\nfaction, as he took no part in the oppressive conduct of the wealthy,\r\nand yet had sufficient fortune to save him from the straits to which the\r\npoor were reduced. In consequence of this, they begged him to come\r\nforward and end their disputes. But Phanias of Lesbos says that Solon\r\ndeceived both parties, in order to save the state, promising the poor a\r\nredistribution of lands, and the rich a confirmation of their\r\nsecurities. However, Solon himself tells us that it was with reluctance\r\nthat he interfered, as he was threatened by the avarice of the one\r\nparty, and the desperation of the other. He was chosen archon next after\r\nPhilombrotus, to act as an arbitrator and lawgiver at once, because the\r\nrich had confidence in him as a man of easy fortune, and the poor\r\ntrusted him as a good man. It is said also that a saying which he had\r\nlet fall some time before, that \"equality does not breed strife,\" was\r\nmuch circulated at the time, and pleased both parties, because the rich\r\nthought it meant that property should be distributed according to merit\r\nand desert, while the poor thought it meant according to rule and\r\nmeasure. Both parties were now elate with hope, and their leaders urged\r\nSolon to seize the supreme power in the state, of which he was\r\npractically possessed, and make himself king. Many even of the more\r\nmoderate class of politicians, who saw how weary and difficult a task it\r\nwould be to reform the state by debates and legislative measures, were\r\nquite willing that so wise and honest a man should undertake the sole\r\nmanagement of affairs. It is even said that Solon received an oracle as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    \"Take thou the helm, the vessel guide,\r\n    Athens will rally to thy side.\"\r\n\r\nHis intimate friends were loudest in their reproaches, pointing out that\r\nit was merely the name of despot from which he shrunk, and that in his\r\ncase his virtues would lead men to regard him as a legitimate hereditary\r\nsovereign; instancing also Tunnondas, who in former times had been\r\nchosen by the Euboeans, and, at the present time, Pittakus, who had been\r\nchosen king of Mitylene. But nothing could shake Solon's determination.\r\nHe told his friends that monarchy is indeed a pleasant place, but there\r\nis no way out of it; and he inserted the following verses in answer to\r\nPhokus, in one of his poems:\r\n\r\n                   \"But if I spared\r\n    My country, and with dread tyrannic sway,\r\n    Forbore to stain and to pollute my glory;\r\n    I feel no shame at this; nay rather thus,\r\n    I think that I excel mankind.\"\r\n\r\nFrom which it is clear that he possessed a great reputation even before\r\nhe became the lawgiver of Athens.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the reproaches of many of his friends at his refusal to\r\nmake himself despot, he wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"Not a clever man was Solon, not a calculating mind,\r\n    For he would not take the kingdom, which the gods to him inclined,\r\n    In his net he caught the prey, but would not draw it forth to land,\r\n    Overpowered by his terrors, feeble both of heart and hand;\r\n    For a man of greater spirit would have occupied the throne,\r\n    Proud to be the Lord of Athens, though 'twere for a day alone,\r\n    Though the next day he and his into oblivion were thrown.\"\r\n\r\nXV. This is the way in which he says the masses, and low-minded men,\r\nspoke of him. He, however, firmly rejecting the throne, proceeded\r\nquietly to administer public affairs, in laying down his laws without\r\nany weak yielding to the powerful, or any attempt to court popularity.\r\nSuch as were good, he did not meddle with, fearing that if he\r\n\r\n    \"Disturbed and overset the state,\"\r\n\r\nhe might not have sufficient power to\r\n\r\n    \"Reconstitute and organise again,\"\r\n\r\nin the best way. He carried out his measures by persuasion, and, where\r\nhe thought he could succeed, by force; in his own words,\r\n\r\n    \"Combining Force and Justice both together.\"\r\n\r\nBeing afterwards asked whether he had composed the best possible laws\r\nfor the Athenians, he answered, \"The best that they would endure.\" And\r\nthe habit of Athenians of later times, who soften down harsh words by\r\nusing politer equivalents, calling harlots \"mistresses,\" taxes\r\n\"contributions,\" garrisons of cities \"protectors,\" and the common prison\r\n\"the house,\" was, it seems, first invented by Solon, who devised the\r\nname of \"relief from burdens\" for his measure to abolish all debts.\r\n\r\nThis was his first measure; namely, to put an end to all existing debts\r\nand obligations, and to forbid any one in future to lend money upon\r\nsecurity of the person of the debtor. Some writers, among whom is\r\nAndrotion, say that he benefited the poor, not by the absolute\r\nextinction of debt, but by establishing a lower rate of interest; and\r\nthat this measure was called \"Relief from burdens,\" and together with it\r\nthe two other measures for the enlargement of measures and of the value\r\nof money, which were passed about the same time. For he ordered a mina,\r\nwhich was before constituted of seventy three drachmas, to contain a\r\nhundred, so that, though they paid the same amount, yet the value was\r\nless; thus those who had much to pay were benefited, and still their\r\ncreditors were not cheated. But most writers say that the \"Relief from\r\nburdens\" meant the extinction of all securities whatever, and this\r\nagrees best with what we read in his poems. For Solon prides himself in\r\nthese upon having\r\n\r\n    \"Taken off the mortgages, which on the land were laid,\r\n    And made the country free, which was formerly enslaved.\"\r\n\r\nWhile he speaks of bringing back Athenian citizens who had been sold\r\ninto slavery abroad,\r\n\r\n    \"In distant lands who roam,\r\n      Their native tongue forgot,\r\n    Or here endure at home\r\n      A slave's disgraceful lot,\"\r\n\r\nand of making them free men again.\r\n\r\nIt is said that in consequence of this measure he met with the greatest\r\ntrouble of his life. As he was meditating how he might put an end to\r\ndebt, and what words and preambles were best for the introduction of\r\nthis law, he took counsel with his most intimate friends, such as Konon\r\nand Kleinias and Hipponikus, informing them that he had no intention of\r\ninterfering with the tenure of land, but that he intended to abolishing\r\nall existing securities. They instantly took time by the forelock,\r\nborrowed large sums from the wealthy, and bought up a great extent of\r\nland. Presently the decree came forth, and they remained in enjoyment of\r\nthese estates, but did not repay their loan to their creditors. This\r\nbrought Solon into great discredit, for the people believed that he had\r\nbeen their accomplice. But he soon proved that this must be false, by\r\nremitting a debt of five talents which he himself had lent; and some\r\nstate the sum at fifteen talents, amongst whom is Polyzelus of Rhodes.\r\nHowever, his friends were for ever afterwards called \"The Swindlers.\"\r\n\r\nXVI. By this measure he pleased neither party, but the rich were\r\ndissatisfied at the loss of their securities, and the poor were still\r\nmore so because the land was not divided afresh, as they hoped it would\r\nbe, and because he had not, like Lykurgus, established absolute\r\nequality.\r\n\r\nBut Lykurgus was eleventh in direct descent from Herakles, and had\r\nreigned in Lacedaemon for many years, and had his own great reputation,\r\nfriends, and interest to assist him in carrying out his reforms: and\r\nalthough he chose to effect his purpose by violence, so that his eye was\r\nactually knocked out, yet he succeeded in carrying that measure, so\r\nvaluable for the safety and concord of the state, by which it was\r\nrendered impossible for any citizen to be either rich or poor. Solon's\r\npower could not reach this height, as he was only a commoner and a\r\nmoderate man; yet he did all that was in his power, relying solely upon\r\nthe confidence and goodwill of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that they were disappointed, and expected more from his\r\nlegislation, from his own verses--\r\n\r\n    \"Once they speculated gaily, what good luck should them befall,\r\n    Now they look upon me coldly, as a traitor to them all.\"\r\n\r\nYet he says, if any one else had been in his position,\r\n\r\n    \"He ne'er would have desisted from unsettling the laws,\r\n    Till he himself got all the cream.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, not long afterwards, they perceived the public benefits which\r\nhe had conferred upon them, forgot their private grievances, and made a\r\npublic sacrifice in honour of the Seisachtheia, or \"Relief from\r\nburdens.\" Moreover, they constituted Solon supreme reformer and\r\nlawgiver, not over some departments only, but placing everything alike\r\nin his hands; magistracies, public assemblies, senate, and law-courts.\r\nHe had full powers to confirm or abolish any of these, and to fix the\r\nproper qualifications for members of them, and their numbers and times\r\nof meeting.\r\n\r\nXVII. First of all, then, he repealed all the laws of Drakon, except\r\nthose relating to murder, because of their harshness and the excessive\r\npunishments which they awarded. For death was the punishment for almost\r\nevery offence, so that even men convicted of idleness were executed, and\r\nthose who stole pot-herbs or fruits suffered just like sacrilegious\r\nrobbers and murderers. So that Demades afterwards made the joke that\r\nDrakon's laws were not written with ink, but with blood. It is said\r\nthat Drakon himself, when asked why he had fixed the punishment of death\r\nfor most offences, answered that he considered these lesser crimes to\r\ndeserve it, and he had no greater punishment for more important ones.\r\n\r\nXVIII. In the next place, Solon, who wished to leave all magistracies as\r\nhe found them, in the hands of the wealthy classes, but to give the\r\npeople a share in the rest of the constitution, from which they were\r\nthen excluded, took a census of the wealth of the citizens, and made a\r\nfirst class of those who had an annual income of not less than five\r\nhundred medimni of dry or liquid produce; these he called\r\nPentakosiomedimni. The next class were the Hippeis, or knights,\r\nconsisting of those who were able to keep a horse, or who had an income\r\nof three hundred medimni. The third class were the Zeugitae, whose\r\nproperty qualification was two hundred medimni of dry or liquid produce;\r\nand the last class were the Thetes, whom Solon did not permit to be\r\nmagistrates, but whose only political privilege was the right of\r\nattending the public assemblies and sitting as jurymen in the law\r\ncourts. This privilege was at first insignificant, but afterwards became\r\nof infinite importance, because most disputes were settled before a\r\njury. Even in those cases which he allowed the magistrates to settle, he\r\nprovided a final appeal to the people.\r\n\r\nSolon moreover is said to have purposely worded his laws vaguely and\r\nwith several interpretations, in order to increase the powers of these\r\njuries, because persons who could not settle their disputes by the\r\nletter of the law were obliged to have recourse to juries of the people,\r\nand to refer all disputes to them, as being to a certain extent above\r\nthe laws. He himself notices this in the following verses:\r\n\r\n    \"I gave the people all the strength they needed,\r\n      Yet kept the power of the nobles strong;\r\n    Thus each from other's violence I shielded,\r\n      Not letting either do the other wrong.\"\r\n\r\nThinking that the weakness of the populace required still further\r\nprotection, he permitted any man to prosecute on behalf of any other who\r\nmight be ill-treated. Thus if a man were struck or injured, any one else\r\nwho was able and willing might prosecute on his behalf, and the\r\nlawgiver by this means endeavoured to make the whole body of citizens\r\nact together and feel as one. A saying of his is recorded which quite\r\nagrees with the spirit of this law. Being asked, what he thought was the\r\nbest managed city? \"That,\" he answered, \"in which those who are not\r\nwronged espouse the cause of those who are, and punish their\r\noppressors.\"\r\n\r\nXIX. He established the senate of the Areopagus of those who had held\r\nthe yearly office of archon, and himself became a member of it because\r\nhe had been archon. But in addition to this, observing that the people\r\nwere becoming turbulent and unruly, in consequence of their relief from\r\ndebt, he formed a second senate, consisting of a hundred men selected\r\nfrom each of the four tribes, to deliberate on measures in the first\r\ninstance, and he permitted no measures to be proposed before the general\r\nassembly, which had not been previously discussed in this senate. The\r\nupper senate he intended to exercise a general supervision, and to\r\nmaintain the laws, and he thought that with these two senates as her\r\nanchors, the ship of the state would ride more securely, and that the\r\npeople would be less inclined to disorder. Most writers say that Solon\r\nconstituted the senate of the Areopagus, as is related above; and this\r\nview is supported by the fact that Drakon nowhere mentions or names the\r\nAreopagites, but in all cases of murder refers to the Ephetai. However,\r\nthe eighth law on the thirteenth table of the laws of Solon runs thus:--\r\n\r\n\"All citizens who were disfranchised before the magistracy of Solon\r\nshall resume their rights, except those who have been condemned by the\r\nAreopagus, or by the Ephetai, or by the king--archons, in the prytaneum,\r\nfor murder or manslaughter, or attempts to overthrow the government and\r\nwho were in exile when this law was made.\"\r\n\r\nThis again proves that the senate of the Areopagus existed before the\r\ntime of Solon; for who could those persons be who were condemned by the\r\ncourt of the Areopagus, if Solon was the first who gave the senate of\r\nthe Areopagus a criminal jurisdiction; though perhaps some words have\r\nbeen left out, or indistinctly written, and the law means \"all those\r\nwho had been condemned on the charges which now are judged by the court\r\nof the Areopagus, the Ephetai, or the Prytanies, when this law was made,\r\nmust remain disfranchised, though the others become enfranchised?\" Of\r\nthese explanations the reader himself must consider which he prefers.\r\n\r\nXX. The strangest of his remaining laws is that which declared\r\ndisfranchised a citizen who in a party conflict took neither side;\r\napparently his object was to prevent any one regarding home politics in\r\na listless, uninterested fashion, securing his own personal property,\r\nand priding himself upon exemption from the misfortunes of his country,\r\nand to encourage men boldly to attach themselves to the right party and\r\nto share all its dangers, rather than in safety to watch and see which\r\nside would be successful. That also is a strange and even ludicrous\r\nprovision in one of his laws, which permits an heiress, whose husband\r\nproves impotent, to avail herself of the services of the next of kin to\r\nobtain an heir to her estate. Some, however, say that this law rightly\r\nserves men who know themselves to be unfit for marriage, and who\r\nnevertheless marry heiresses for their money, and try to make the laws\r\noverride nature; for, when they see their wife having intercourse with\r\nwhom she pleases, they will either break off the marriage, or live in\r\nconstant shame, and so pay the penalty of their avarice and wrong-doing.\r\nIt is a good provision also, that the heiress may not converse with any\r\none, but only with him whom she may choose from among her husband's\r\nrelations, so that her offspring may be all in the family. This is\r\npointed at by his ordinance that the bride and bridegroom should be shut\r\nin the same room and eat a quince together, and that the husband of an\r\nheiress should approach her at least thrice in each month. For even if\r\nno children are born, still this is a mark of respect to a good wife,\r\nand puts an end to many misunderstandings, preventing their leading to\r\nan actual quarrel.\r\n\r\nIn other marriages he suppressed dowries, and ordered the bride to bring\r\nto her husband three dresses and a few articles of furniture of no great\r\nvalue; for he did not wish marriages to be treated as money bargains or\r\nmeans of gain, but that men and women should enter into marriage for\r\nlove and happiness and procreation of children. Dionysius, the despot of\r\nSyracuse, when his mother wished to be married to a young citizen, told\r\nher that he had indeed broken the laws of the state when he seized the\r\nthrone, but that he could not disregard the laws of nature so far as to\r\ncountenance such a monstrous union. These disproportioned matches ought\r\nnot to be permitted in any state, nor should men be allowed to form\r\nunequal loveless alliances, which are in no sense true marriages. A\r\nmagistrate or lawgiver might well address an old man who marries a young\r\ngirl in the words of Sophokles: \"Poor wretch, a hopeful bridegroom you\r\nwill be;\" and if he found a young man fattening like a partridge in the\r\nhouse of a rich old woman, he ought to transfer him to some young maiden\r\nwho is without a husband. So much for this subject.\r\n\r\nXXI. Besides these, Solon's law which forbids men to speak evil of the\r\ndead is much praised. It is good to think of the departed as sacred, and\r\nit is only just to refrain from attacking the absent, while it is\r\npolitic, also, to prevent hatred from being eternal. He also forbade\r\npeople to speak evil of the living in temples, courts of justice, public\r\nbuildings, or during the national games; and imposed a fine of three\r\ndrachmas to the person offended, and two to the state. His reason for\r\nthis was that it shows a violent and uncultivated nature not to be able\r\nto restrain one's passion in certain places and at certain times,\r\nalthough it is hard to do so always, and to some persons impossible; and\r\na legislator should frame his laws with a view to what he can reasonably\r\nhope to effect, and rather correct a few persons usefully than punish a\r\nnumber to no purpose.\r\n\r\nHe gained credit also by his law about wills. Before his time these were\r\nnot permitted at Athens, but the money and lands of a deceased person\r\nwere inherited by his family in all cases. Solon, however, permitted any\r\none who had no children to leave his property to whom he would,\r\nhonouring friendship more than nearness of kin, and giving a man\r\nabsolute power to dispose of his inheritance. Yet, on the other hand, he\r\ndid not permit legacies to be given without any restrictions, but\r\ndisallowed all that were obtained by the effects of disease or by\r\nadministration of drugs to the testator, or by imprisonment and\r\nviolence, or by the solicitations of his wife, as he rightly considered\r\nthat to be persuaded by one's wife against one's better judgment is the\r\nsame as to submit to force. For Solon held that a man's reason was\r\nperverted by deceit as much as by violence, and by pleasure no less than\r\nby pain.\r\n\r\nHe regulated, moreover, the journeys of the women, and their mournings\r\nand festivals. A woman was not allowed to travel with more than three\r\ndresses, nor with more than an obolus' worth of food or drink, nor a\r\nbasket more than a cubit in length; nor was she to travel at night,\r\nexcept in a waggon with a light carried in front of it. He abolished the\r\nhabits of tearing themselves at funerals, and of reciting set forms of\r\ndirges, and of hiring mourners. He also forbade them to sacrifice an ox\r\nfor the funeral feast, and to bury more than three garments with the\r\nbody, and to visit other persons' graves. Most of these things are\r\nforbidden by our own laws also; with the addition, that by our laws\r\nthose who offend thus are fined by the gynaeconomi, or regulators of the\r\nwomen, for giving way to unmanly and womanish sorrow.\r\n\r\nXXII. Observing that the city was filled with men who came from all\r\ncountries to take refuge in Attica, that the country was for the most\r\npart poor and unproductive, and that merchants also are unwilling to\r\ndespatch cargoes to a country which has nothing to export, he encouraged\r\nhis countrymen to embark in trade, and made a law that a son was not\r\nobliged to support his father, if his father had not taught him a trade.\r\nAs for Lykurgus, whose city was clear of strangers, and whose land was\r\n\"unstinted, and with room for twice the number,\" as Euripides says, and\r\nwho above all had all the Helots, throughout Lacedaemon, who were best\r\nkept employed, in order to break their spirit by labour and hardship, it\r\nwas very well that his citizens should disdain laborious handicrafts and\r\ndevote their whole attention to the art of war.\r\n\r\nBut Solon had not the power to change the whole life of his countrymen\r\nby his laws, but rather was forced to suit his laws to existing\r\ncircumstances, and, as he saw that the soil was so poor that it could\r\nonly suffice for the farmers, and was unable to feed a mass of idle\r\npeople as well, he gave great honour to trade, and gave powers to the\r\nsenate of the Areopagus to inquire what each man's source of income\r\nmight be, and to punish the idle. A harsher measure was that of which we\r\nare told by Herakleides of Pontus, his making it unnecessary for\r\nillegitimate children to maintain their father. Yet if a man abstains\r\nfrom an honourable marriage, and lives with a woman more for his own\r\npleasure in her society than with a view to producing a family, he is\r\nrightly served, and cannot upbraid his children with neglecting him,\r\nbecause he has made their birth their reproach.\r\n\r\nXXIII. Altogether Solon's laws concerning women are very strange. He\r\npermitted a husband to kill an adulterer taken in the act; but if any\r\none carried off a free woman and forced her, he assessed the penalty at\r\none hundred drachmas. If he obtained her favours by persuasion, he was\r\nto pay twenty drachmas, except in the case of those who openly ply for\r\nhire, alluding to harlots; for they come to those who offer them money\r\nwithout any concealment. Moreover, he forbade men to sell their sisters\r\nand daughters, except in the case of unchastity. Now to punish the same\r\noffence at one time with unrelenting severity, and at another in a light\r\nand trifling manner, by imposing so slight a fine, is unreasonable,\r\nunless the scarcity of specie in the city at that period made fines\r\nwhich were paid in money more valuable than they would now be; indeed,\r\nin the valuation of things for sacrifice, a sheep and a drachma were\r\nreckoned as each equal to a medimnus of corn. To the victor at the\r\nIsthmian games he appointed a reward of a hundred drachmas, and to the\r\nvictor in the Olympian, five hundred. He gave five drachmas for every\r\nwolf that was killed, and one drachma for every wolf's whelp; and we are\r\ntold by Demetrius of Phalerum that the first of these sums was the price\r\nof an ox, and the second that of a sheep. The prices of choice victims,\r\nwhich he settled in his sixteenth tablet of laws, would naturally be\r\nhigher than those of ordinary beasts, but even thus they are cheap\r\ncompared with prices at the present day. It was an ancient practice\r\namong the Athenians to destroy the wolves, because their country was\r\nbetter fitted for pasture than for growing crops. Some say that the\r\nAthenian tribes derive their names, not from the sons of Ion, but from\r\nthe different professions in which men were then divided: thus the\r\nfighting men were named Hoplites, and the tradesmen Ergadeis; the two\r\nremaining ones being the Geleontes, or farmers, and the Aigikoreis, or\r\ngoat-herds and graziers. With regard to water, as the country is not\r\nsupplied with either rivers or lakes, but the people depend chiefly upon\r\nartificial wells, he made a law, that wherever there was a public well\r\nwithin four furlongs, people should use it, but if it were farther off,\r\nthen they must dig a private well for themselves; but if a man dug a\r\ndepth of sixty feet on his own estate without finding water, then he was\r\nto have the right of filling a six-gallon pitcher twice a day at his\r\nneighbour's well; for Solon thought it right to help the distressed, and\r\nyet not to encourage laziness. He also made very judicious regulations\r\nabout planting trees, ordering that they should not be planted within\r\nfive feet of a neighbour's property, except in the case of olives and\r\nfig-trees, which were not to be planted within nine feet; for these\r\ntrees spread out their roots farther than others, and spoil the growth\r\nof any others by taking away their nourishment and by giving off hurtful\r\njuices. Trenches and pits he ordered to be dug as far away from another\r\nman's property as they were deep; and no hive of bees was to be placed\r\nwithin three hundred feet of those already established by another man.\r\n\r\nXXIV. Oil was the only product of the country which he allowed to be\r\nexported, everything else being forbidden; and he ordered that if any\r\none broke this law the archon was to solemnly curse him, unless he paid\r\na hundred drachmas into the public treasury. This law is written on the\r\nfirst of his tablets. From this we see that the old story is not\r\naltogether incredible, that the export of figs was forbidden, and that\r\nthe men who informed against those who had done so were therefore called\r\nsycophants. He also made laws about damage received from animals, one of\r\nwhich was that a dog who had bitten a man should be delivered up to him\r\ntied to a stick three cubits long, an ingenious device for safety.\r\n\r\nOne is astounded at his law of adopting foreigners into the state,\r\nwhich permits no one to become a full citizen in Athens unless he be\r\neither exiled for life from his native city, or transfers himself with\r\nhis whole family to Athens to practise his trade there. It is said that\r\nhis object in this was not so much to exclude other classes of people\r\nfrom the city, as to assure these of a safe refuge there; and these he\r\nthought would be good and faithful citizens, because the former had been\r\nbanished from their own country, and the latter had abandoned it of\r\ntheir own freewill. Another peculiarity of Solon's laws was the public\r\ndining-table in the prytaneum. Here he did not allow the same person to\r\ndine often, while he punished the man who was invited and would not\r\ncome, because the one seemed gluttonous, and the other contemptuous.\r\n\r\nXXV. He ordered that all his laws should remain in force for a hundred\r\nyears, and he wrote them upon triangular wooden tablets, which revolved\r\nupon an axis in oblong recesses, some small remains of which have been\r\npreserved in the prytaneum down to the present day. These, we are told\r\nby Aristotle, were called _Kurbeis_. The comic poet Kratinus also says,\r\n\r\n    \"By Solon and by Draco, mighty legislators once,\r\n    Whose tablets light the fire now to warm a dish of pulse.\"\r\n\r\nSome say that the term _Kurbeis_ is only applied to those on which are\r\nwritten the laws which regulate religious matters.\r\n\r\nThe senate swore by a collective oath that it would enforce Solon's\r\nlaws; and each of the Thesmothetae took an oath to the same effect at\r\nthe altar in the market-place, protesting that, if he transgressed any\r\nof the laws, he would offer a golden statue as big as himself to the\r\ntemple at Delphi.\r\n\r\nObserving the irregularity of the months, and that the motions of the\r\nmoon did not accord either with the rising or setting of the sun, but\r\nthat frequently she in the same day overtakes and passes by him, he\r\nordered that day to be called \"the old and the new,\" and that the part\r\nof it before their conjunction should belong to the old month, while the\r\nrest of the day after it belonged to the new one, being, it seems, the\r\nfirst to rightly interpret the verse of Homer--\r\n\r\n    \"The old month ended and the new began.\"\r\n\r\nHe called the next day that of the new moon. After the twentieth, he no\r\nlonger reckoned forwards, but backwards, as the moon decreased, until\r\nthe thirtieth of the month.\r\n\r\nWhen Solon had passed all his laws, as people came to him every day to\r\npraise or blame, or advise him to add or take away from what he had\r\nwritten, while innumerable people wanted to ask questions, and discuss\r\npoints, and kept bidding him explain what was the object of this or that\r\nregulation, he, feeling that he could not do all this, and that, if he\r\ndid not, his motives would be misunderstood; wishing, moreover, to\r\nescape from troubles and the criticism and fault-finding of his\r\ncountrymen [for, as he himself writes, it is \"Hard in great measures\r\nevery one to please\"], made his private commercial business an excuse\r\nfor leaving the country, and set sail after having obtained from the\r\nAthenians leave of absence for ten years. In this time he thought they\r\nwould become used to his laws.\r\n\r\nXXVI. He first went to Egypt, where he spent some time, as he himself\r\nsays,\r\n\r\n    \"At Nilus' outlets, by Canopus' strand.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he also discussed points of philosophy with Psenophis of Heliopolis,\r\nand with Sonchis of Sais, the most distinguished of the Egyptian\r\npriests. From them he heard the tale of the island Atlantis, as we are\r\ntold by Plato, and endeavoured to translate it into a poetical form for\r\nthe enjoyment of his countrymen. He next sailed to Cyprus, where he was\r\nwarmly received by Philocyprus, one of the local sovereigns, who ruled\r\nover a small city founded by Demophon, the son of Theseus, near the\r\nriver Klarius, in a position which was easily defended, but\r\ninconvenient.\r\n\r\nAs a fair plain lay below, Solon persuaded him to remove the city to a\r\npleasanter and less contracted site, and himself personally\r\nsuperintended the building of the new city, which he arranged so well\r\nboth for convenience and safety, that many new settlers joined\r\nPhilocyprus, and he was envied by the neighbouring kings. For this\r\nreason, in honour of Solon, he named the new city Soloi, the name of the\r\nold one having been Aipeia. Solon himself mentions this event, in one of\r\nhis elegiac poems, in which he addresses Philocyprus, saying--\r\n\r\n                         \"Long may'st thou reign,\r\n      Ruling thy race from Soloi's throne with glory,\r\n    But me may Venus of the violet crown\r\n      Send safe away from Cyprus famed in story.\r\n    May Heaven to these new walls propitious prove,\r\n    And bear me safely to the land I love.\"\r\n\r\nXXVII. Some writers argue, on chronological grounds, that Solon's\r\nmeeting with Croesus must have been an invention. But I cannot think\r\nthat so famous a story, which is confirmed by so many writers, and,\r\nmoreover, which so truly exhibits Solon's greatness of mind and wisdom,\r\nought to be given up because of the so-called rules of chronology, which\r\nhave been discussed by innumerable persons, up to the present day,\r\nwithout their being ever able to make their dates agree. The story goes\r\nthat Solon at Croesus's desire came to Sardis, and there felt much like\r\na continental when he goes down to the seaside for the first time; for\r\nhe thinks each river he comes to must be the sea, and so Solon, as he\r\nwalked through the court and saw many of the courtiers richly attired\r\nand each of them swaggering about with a train of attendants and\r\nbody-guards, thought that each one must be the king, until he was\r\nbrought before the king himself, who, as far as precious stones, richly\r\ndyed clothes, and cunningly worked gold could adorn him, was splendid\r\nand admirable, indeed a grand and gorgeous spectacle to behold. When\r\nSolon was brought into his presence, he showed none of the feelings and\r\nmade none of the remarks about the sight, which Croesus expected, but\r\nevidently despised such vulgar ostentation. Croesus then ordered his\r\ntreasures to be exhibited to him, and all the rest of his possessions\r\nand valuables; not that Solon needed this, for the sight of Croesus\r\nhimself was enough to show him what sort of man he was. When, after\r\nhaving seen all this, he was again brought before the king, Croesus\r\nasked him whether he knew any man more happy than himself. Solon at\r\nonce answered that one Tellus, a fellow countryman of his own, was more\r\nhappy. He explained that Tellus was a good man, and left a family of\r\ngood sons; that he passed his life beyond the reach of want, and died\r\ngloriously in battle for his country. At this, Croesus began to think\r\nthat Solon must be a cross-grained churlish fellow, if he did not\r\nmeasure happiness by silver and gold, but preferred the life and death\r\nof some private man of low degree to such power and empire as his.\r\nHowever, he asked him a second time, whether he knew any one more happy\r\nthan himself, next to Tellus. Solon answered that he knew two men,\r\nKleobis and Biton, remarkable for their love for each other and for\r\ntheir mother, who, as the oxen that drew their mother travelled slowly,\r\nput themselves under the yoke and drew the carriage with her in it to\r\nthe temple of Here. She was congratulated by all the citizens, and was\r\nvery proud of them; and they offered sacrifice, drank some wine, and\r\nthen passed away by a painless death after so much glory.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" asked Croesus angrily, \"do you not reckon me at all among happy\r\nmen?\" Solon, who did not wish to flatter him, nor yet to exasperate him\r\nfarther, answered, \"O King of the Lydians, we Greeks have been endowed\r\nwith moderate gifts, by Heaven, and our wisdom is of a cautious and\r\nhomely cast, not of a royal and magnificent character; so, being\r\nmoderate itself, and seeing the manifold chances to which life is\r\nexposed, it does not permit us to take a pride in our present\r\npossessions, nor to admire the good fortune of any man when it is liable\r\nto change. Strange things await every man in the unknown future; and we\r\nthink that man alone happy whose life has been brought to a fortunate\r\ntermination. To congratulate a man who is yet alive and exposed to the\r\ncaprice of fortune is like proclaiming and crowning as victor one who\r\nhas not yet run his race, for his good fortune is uncertain and liable\r\nto reversal.\" After speaking thus, Solon took his leave, having enraged\r\nCroesus, who could not take his good advice.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. Aesop, the writer of the fables, who had been sent for to Sardis\r\nby Croesus and enjoyed his favour, was vexed at the king's ungracious\r\nreception of Solon, and advised him thus: \"Solon,\" said he, \"one ought\r\neither to say very little to kings or else say what they wish most to\r\nhear.\" \"Not so,\" said Solon; \"one should either say very little to them,\r\nor else say what is best for them to hear.\" So at that time Croesus\r\ndespised Solon; but after he had been defeated by Cyrus, his city taken,\r\nand he himself was about to be burned alive upon a pyre erected in the\r\npresence of all the Persians and of Cyrus himself, then he thrice cried\r\nout, \"Solon,\" as loud as he could. Cyrus, surprised at this, sent to ask\r\nwhat man or god Solon might be, who was invoked by a man in such\r\nextremity. Croesus, without any concealment said, \"He is one of the wise\r\nmen of Greece, whom I sent for, not because I wished to listen to him\r\nand learn what I was ignorant of, but in order that he might see and\r\ntell of my wealth, which I find it is a greater misfortune to lose than\r\nit was a blessing to possess. For, while I possessed it, all I enjoyed\r\nwas opinion and empty talk; whereas, now the loss of it has brought me\r\nin very deed into terrible and irreparable misfortunes and sufferings.\r\nNow this man, who foresaw what might befall me, bade me look to the end\r\nof my life, and not be arrogant on the strength of a fleeting\r\nprosperity.\"\r\n\r\nWhen this was reported to Cyrus, he being a wiser man than Croesus, and\r\nfinding Solon's words strongly borne out by the example before him, not\r\nonly released Croesus, but treated him with favour for the rest of his\r\nlife; so that Solon had the glory of having by the same words saved one\r\nking's life and given instruction to another.\r\n\r\nXXIX. During Solon's absence the strife of the factions at Athens was\r\nrenewed; Lykurgus was the chief of the party of the Pediaei, Megakles,\r\nthe son of Alkmaeon, led the Parali, and Peisistratus, the Diakrii, who\r\nwere joined by the mass of the poorer classes who hated the rich. Thus\r\nthe city still obeyed Solon's laws, but was longing for change, and all\r\nmen hoped for a new revolution, in which they trusted to get not only\r\ntheir rights, but something more, and to triumph over the opposite\r\nfaction. In this state of affairs Solon landed at Athens, and was\r\nreceived with respect by all the citizens. Although, on account of his\r\nage, he was no longer able to engage in politics as keenly as before,\r\nstill he met the leaders of the various factions privately and\r\nendeavoured to arrange their differences and reconcile them to one\r\nanother. Peisistratus appeared to pay more attention to him than the\r\nothers, for he was crafty and pleasant of speech, a protector of the\r\npoor, and a man of moderation even in his quarrels. The qualities which\r\nhe had not, he affected to possess, giving himself out to be a cautious\r\nand law-abiding man, who loved even-handed justice and was enraged at\r\nany revolutionary proceedings. Thus he deceived the people; but Solon\r\nsoon saw through him, and detected his plans before any one else. He was\r\nnot shocked, but endeavoured to turn him from his purpose by advice,\r\nsaying to him and to others that if his desire to be first and his wish\r\nto make himself master could be removed, there would be no more\r\nexcellent and virtuous citizen than Peisistratus.\r\n\r\nAt this time Thespis was beginning to introduce the drama, and the\r\nnovelty of his exhibition attracted many people, although the regular\r\ncontests were not yet introduced. Solon, who was fond of seeing sights\r\nand gaining knowledge, and whose old age was spent in leisure and\r\namusements and good fellowship, went to see Thespis, who acted in his\r\nown play, as the ancient custom was. After the play was over, he asked\r\nhim if he was not ashamed to tell so many lies before so many people.\r\nWhen Thespis answered that there was no harm in saying and doing these\r\nthings in jest, Solon violently struck the ground with his stick,\r\nsaying, \"If we praise and approve of such jests as these, we shall soon\r\nfind people jesting with our business.\"\r\n\r\nXXX. When Peisistratus wounded himself and was driven into the\r\nmarket-place in a cart to excite the people, whom he told that he had\r\nbeen so treated by his enemies because he defended the constitution, and\r\nwhile he was surrounded by a noisy crowd of sympathisers, Solon came\r\nnear him and said, \"Son of Hippokrates, you are dishonourably imitating\r\nHomer's Ulysses. You are doing this to deceive your fellow citizens,\r\nwhile he mutilated himself to deceive the enemy.\" Upon this, as the\r\npeople were willing to take up arms on behalf of Peisistratus, they\r\nassembled at the Pnyx, where Ariston proposed that a body-guard of\r\nfifty club-bearers should be assigned to Peisistratus. Solon opposed\r\nthis, urging many arguments, like what we read in his poems:\r\n\r\n    \"You hang upon a crafty speaker's words;\"\r\n\r\nand again,\r\n\r\n    \"Each alone a fox in cunning,\r\n    You grow stupid when you meet.\"\r\n\r\nBut as he saw that the poor were eager to serve Peisistratus, while the\r\nrich held back from cowardice, he went away, after saying that he was\r\nwiser than the one class, and braver than the other; wiser, namely, than\r\nthose who did not understand what was going on, and braver than those\r\nwho did understand, but did not dare to oppose the despotism with which\r\nthey were threatened.\r\n\r\nThe people carried the proposal, and would not be so mean as to make any\r\nstipulation with Peisistratus about the number of his body-guard, but\r\npermitted him to keep as many as he pleased until he seized the\r\nAcropolis. When this took place, the city was convulsed; Megakles and\r\nthe other descendants of Alkmaeon fled, but Solon, although he was now\r\nvery old and had no one to stand by him, nevertheless came into the\r\nmarket-place and addressed the citizens, reproaching them for their\r\nfolly and remissness, and urging them to make a final effort to retain\r\ntheir freedom. It was then that he made the memorable remark that, in\r\nformer days it would have been easier for them to have prevented\r\ndespotism from appearing amongst them, but that now it would be more\r\nglorious to cut it down, when it had arrived at its full growth.\r\nHowever, as no one listened to him, because of the general terror, he\r\nwent home, armed himself, and took his post in the street outside his\r\ndoor, saying, \"I have done all I could for my country and her laws.\"\r\nAfter this he remained quiet, though his friends urged him to leave\r\nAthens. He, however, wrote poems reproaching the Athenians--\r\n\r\n    \"Through your own cowardice you suffered wrong,\r\n      Blame then yourselves and not the gods for this;\r\n    'Twas you yourselves that made the tyrant strong,\r\n      And rightly do you now your freedom miss.\"\r\n\r\nXXXI. At this many of his friends told him that the despot would surely\r\nput him to death, and when they asked him what he trusted to, that he\r\nperformed such mad freaks, he answered, \"To my age.\" But Peisistratus,\r\nafter he became established as sovereign, showed such marked favour to\r\nSolon that he even was advised by him, and received his approval in\r\nseveral cases. For he enforced most of Solon's laws, both observing them\r\nhimself and obliging his friends to do so. Indeed, when accused of\r\nmurder before the court of the Areopagus, he appeared in due form to\r\nstand his trial, but his accuser let the case fall through. He also made\r\nother laws himself, one of which is that those who are maimed in war\r\nshall be kept at the public expense. Herakleides says that this was done\r\nin imitation of Solon, who had already proposed it in the case of\r\nThersippus. But Theophrastus tells us that it was not Solon, but\r\nPeisistratus, who made the law about idleness, by means of which he\r\nrendered the city more quiet, and the country better cultivated.\r\n\r\nSolon also attempted to write a great poem about the fable of\r\n'Atlantis,' which he had learned from the chroniclers of Sais\r\nparticularly concerned the Athenians, but he did not finish it, not, as\r\nPlato says, for want of leisure, but rather because of his advanced age,\r\nwhich made him fear that the task was too great for him. His own words\r\ntell us that he had abundance of leisure--\r\n\r\n    \"Old I grow, but ever learning,\"\r\n\r\nand,\r\n\r\n    \"Venus and Bacchus are all my care,\r\n    And the Muses, that charm the hearts of men.\"\r\n\r\nPlato eagerly took in hand the scheme of the 'Atlantis,' as though it\r\nwere a fine site for a palace, which had come to be his by inheritance,\r\nstill unbuilt on. He placed in the beginning of it such splendid\r\nentrance-halls and vestibules as we find in no other tale or legend or\r\npoem, but, as he began the work too late, he died before he was able to\r\nfinish it; so that the more we enjoy what he has written, the more we\r\ngrieve over what is lost. As the temple of Olympic Zeus among the\r\ntemples of Athens, so the 'Atlantis' is the only one among Plato's many\r\nnoble writings that is unfinished.\r\n\r\nSolon lived on into the reign of Peisistratus for a long time,\r\naccording to Herakleides of Pontus, but less than two years, according\r\nto Phanias of Eresus. For Peisistratus became despot in the archonship\r\nof Komius, and Phanias tells us that Solon died during the archonship of\r\nHegesistratus, Komias' successor. The story that his ashes were\r\nscattered round the island of Salamis is legendary and improbable, yet\r\nit is confirmed by many trustworthy writers, amongst whom is the\r\nphilosopher Aristotle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF POPLICOLA.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. As a parallel to Solon we shall take Poplicola, who was honoured with\r\nthis name by the Romans, his original name having been Publius Valerius,\r\na supposed descendant of that Valerius who in ancient times was\r\nespecially instrumental in making the Romans and Sabines cease to be\r\nenemies and become one people; for it was he who persuaded the two kings\r\nto meet and make terms of peace. Valerius, a descendant of this hero,\r\nwas a man of eminence in Rome, which was then ruled by the kings,\r\nbecause of his eloquence and wealth. He always spoke boldly on the side\r\nof justice, and assisted the poor and needy with such kindness that it\r\nwas clear that, in case of a revolution, he would become the first man\r\nin the state.\r\n\r\nTarquinius Superbus, the king, had not come to his throne justly, but by\r\nwicked and lawless violence, and as he reigned tyrannically and\r\ninsolently, the people hated him, and seized the opportunity of the\r\ndeath of Lucretia, after her dishonour, to drive him out. Lucius Brutus,\r\nwho was determined to change the form of government, applied to Valerius\r\nfirst of all, and with his vigorous assistance drove out the king. After\r\nthese events Valerius kept quiet, as long as it seemed likely that the\r\npeople would choose a single general to replace their king, because he\r\nthought that it was Brutus's right to be elected, as he had been the\r\nleader of the revolution. However the people, disgusted with the idea of\r\nmonarchy, and thinking that they could more easily endure to be ruled by\r\ntwo men, proposed that two consuls should be chosen. Valerius now became\r\na candidate, hoping that he and Brutus would be elected; but he was not\r\nchosen. Brutus, instead of Valerius, whom he would have preferred, had\r\nas a colleague Tarquinius Collatinus, the husband of Lucretia, who was\r\nnot a better man than Valerius, but was elected because the men in power\r\nat Rome, seeing what intrigues the exiled king was setting on foot to\r\nsecure his return, wished to have for their general a man who was his\r\nsworn personal enemy.\r\n\r\nII. Valerius, disgusted at the idea that he was not trusted to fight for\r\nhis country because he had not suffered any personal wrong at the hands\r\nof the king, left the senate, refused to attend public meetings, and\r\nceased to take any part whatever in public affairs, so that people began\r\nto fear that in his rage he might go over to the king's party and\r\ndestroy the tottering edifice of Roman liberty. Brutus suspected some\r\nothers besides him, and proposed on a certain day to hold a solemn\r\nsacrifice and bind the senate by an oath. Valerius, however, came\r\ncheerfully into the Forum, and was the first to swear that he would\r\nnever yield anything to the Tarquins, but would fight for liberty to the\r\ndeath, by which he greatly delighted the senate and encouraged the\r\nleading men of the state. His acts too, immediately confirmed his words,\r\nfor ambassadors came from Tarquin with specious and seductive proposals,\r\nsuch as he thought would win over the people, coming from a king who\r\nseemed to have laid aside his insolence and only to wish for his just\r\nrights. The consuls thought it right that these proposals should be laid\r\nbefore the people, but Valerius would not permit it, not wishing that\r\nthe poorer citizens, to whom the war was a greater burden than the\r\nmonarchy had been, should have any excuse for revolt.\r\n\r\nIII. After this came other ambassadors, announcing that Tarquin would\r\ngive up his throne, put an end to the war, and only ask for his own\r\nproperty and that of his relatives and friends, upon which to live in\r\nexile. Many were inclined to agree to this, and amongst them Collatinus,\r\nwhen Brutus, an inflexible and harsh-tempered man, rushed into the\r\nForum, calling out that his colleague was a traitor, who wished to\r\nfurnish the tyrant with the means of continuing the war and recovering\r\nhis throne, when he ought rather to grudge him food to keep him from\r\nstarving. The citizens assembled, and Caius Minucius, a private citizen,\r\nwas the first man who addressed them, encouraging Brutus, and pointing\r\nout to the Romans how much better it was that the money should be used\r\nto help them than to help their enemies. In spite of this, however, the\r\nRomans decided that, as they now possessed the liberty for which they\r\nhad fought, they would not lose the additional blessing of peace for the\r\nsake of this property, but would cast it from them after the tyrant to\r\nwhich it belonged.\r\n\r\nTarquin really cared little for the property, and the demand was merely\r\nmade in order to sound the people and arrange a plot for the betrayal of\r\nthe state, which was managed by the ambassadors whom he had nominally\r\nsent to look after his property. These men were selling some part of it,\r\nkeeping some safe, and sending some of it away, and meanwhile intrigued\r\nso successfully that they won over two of the best families in Rome,\r\nthat of the Aquillii, in which were three senators, and that of the\r\nVitellii, among whom were two. All these men were, on the mother's side,\r\nnephews of the consul Collatinus, and the Vitellii were also related to\r\nBrutus, for he had married their sister, and by her had a large family.\r\nThe Vitellii, being relatives and intimate friends of the two elder sons\r\nof Brutus, induced them to take part in the conspiracy, holding out to\r\nthem the hope that they might ally themselves to the great house of\r\nTarquin, soon to be restored to the throne, and would rid themselves of\r\ntheir father's stupidity and harshness. By harshness, they alluded to\r\nhis inexorable punishment of bad men, and the stupidity was that which\r\nhe himself affected for a long time, in order to conceal his real\r\ncharacter from the tyrant, which was made matter of reproach to him\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nIV. So, after they had persuaded these young men, they conferred again\r\nwith the Aquillii, and determined that all the conspirators should swear\r\na great and terrible oath, in which a man is killed, and each person\r\nthen pours a libation of his blood, and touches his entrails. The room\r\nin which they meant to do this was, as may be supposed, a dark and\r\nhalf-ruined one. Now a servant of the name of Vindicius happened to\r\nconceal himself in it; not that he had any designs or any knowledge of\r\nwhat was going on, but chancing to be in the room when the conspirators\r\nsolemnly entered, he was afraid of being detected there, and so hid\r\nhimself behind a chest, where he could see what was done and hear what\r\nwas said by them. They agreed to assassinate both consuls, and wrote a\r\nletter to Tarquin acquainting him with their determination, which they\r\ngave to the ambassadors, who were lodging in the house of the Aquillii\r\nas their guests, and were present at this scene. After this they\r\ndispersed, and Vindicius came out from his hiding-place. He was at a\r\nloss what use to make of the discovery which Fortune had thrown in his\r\nway, for he thought it a shocking thing, as indeed it was, for him to\r\nmake such a fearful revelation to Brutus about his sons, or to\r\nCollatinus about his nephews, and he would not trust any private citizen\r\nwith a secret of such importance. Tormented by his secret, and unable to\r\nremain quiet, he addressed himself to Valerius, chiefly moved to do so\r\nby his affable kindly temper; for his house was open all day to those\r\nwho wished to speak with him, and he never refused an interview or\r\nrejected a poor man's petition.\r\n\r\nV. When, then, Vindicius came before him and told him all that he knew\r\nin the presence only of his wife and his brother Marcus, Valerius was\r\nastounded and horrified. He would not let the man go, but locked him up,\r\nset his wife to guard the door, and bade his brother to surround the\r\nking's quarters, to seize the letter, if possible, keeping a strict\r\nwatch over all the servants there. He himself, with a large train of\r\nclients, friends and servants, went to the house of the Aquillii, who\r\nwere not within. As no one expected him, he pushed into the house and\r\nfound the letter lying in the ambassadors' apartments.\r\n\r\nWhile he was thus employed, the Aquillii returned in haste, and\r\nassembling a force at the door endeavoured to take away the letter from\r\nhim. His own party came to his assistance, and with their gowns twisted\r\nround their necks with much buffeting made their way to the Forum. The\r\nsame thing happened at the king's quarters, where Marcus laid hold of\r\nanother letter which was being taken thither concealed among some\r\nbaggage, and brought as many of the king's party as he could into the\r\nForum.\r\n\r\nVI. When the consuls had put a stop to the confusion, Vindicius, at\r\nValerius's command, was brought out of his prison, and a court was held.\r\nThe letters were recognised, and the culprits had nothing to say for\r\nthemselves. All were silent and downcast, and a few, thinking to please\r\nBrutus, hinted at banishment as the penalty of their crime. Collatinus\r\nby his tears, and Valerius by his silence gave them hopes of mercy. But\r\nBrutus, addressing each of his sons by name, said, \"Come, Titus, come\r\nTiberius, why do you make no answer to the charges against you?\" As,\r\nafter being asked thrice, they made no answer, he, turning his face to\r\nthe lictors, said, \"I have done my work, do yours.\" They immediately\r\nseized upon the young men, tore off their clothes, tied their hands\r\nbehind their backs, and scourged them. Although the people had not the\r\nheart to look at so dreadful a sight, yet it is said that Brutus never\r\nturned away his head, and showed no pity on his stern countenance, but\r\nsat savagely looking on at the execution of his sons until at last they\r\nwere laid on the ground and their heads severed with an axe. Then he\r\nhanded over the rest of the culprits to be dealt with by his colleague,\r\nrose, and left the Forum. His conduct cannot be praised, and yet it is\r\nabove censure. Either virtue in his mind overpowered every other\r\nfeeling, or his sorrow was so great as to produce insensibility. In\r\nneither case was there anything unworthy, or even human in his conduct,\r\nbut it was either that of a god or a brute beast. It is better, however,\r\nthat we should speak in praise of so great a man rather than allow our\r\nweakness to distrust his virtue. Indeed the Romans think that even the\r\nfoundation of the city by Romulus was not so great an event as the\r\nconfirmation of its constitution by Brutus.\r\n\r\nVII. When he left the Forum all men were silent for a long while,\r\nshuddering at what had been done. The Aquillii took heart at the\r\nmildness of Collatinus, and asked for time to prepare their defence.\r\nThey also begged that Vindicius might be given up to them, because he\r\nwas their servant, and ought not to be on the side of their accusers.\r\nCollatinus was willing to allow this, but Valerius said that he was not\r\nable to give the man up, because he was surrounded by so large a crowd,\r\nand called upon the people not to disperse without punishing the\r\ntraitors. At last he laid his hands upon the two corpses, called for\r\nBrutus, and reproached Collatinus for making his colleague act against\r\nnature by condemning his own sons to death, and then thinking to please\r\nthe wives of these traitors and public enemies by saving their lives.\r\nThe consul, vexed at this, ordered the lictors to seize Vindicius. They\r\nforced their way through the crowd, tried to lay hold of him, and struck\r\nthose who defended him, but the friends of Valerius stood in front of\r\nhim and beat them off, and the people raised a shout for Brutus. He\r\nreturned, and when silence was restored said that he had, as a father,\r\nfull power to condemn his sons to death, but that as for the other\r\nculprits, their fate should be decided by the free vote of the citizens,\r\nand that any one might come forward and address the people. The people,\r\nhowever, would listen to no speeches, but voted unanimously for their\r\ndeath, and they were all beheaded.\r\n\r\nCollatinus, it seems, had been viewed with suspicion before because of\r\nhis connection with the royal family, and his second name, Tarquinius,\r\nwas odious to the people. After these events, having utterly failed as\r\nconsul, he voluntarily laid down that office, and left the city. So now\r\nthere was another election, and Valerius received the due reward of his\r\npatriotism and was gloriously made consul. Thinking that Vindicius ought\r\nto receive something for his services, he made him a freedman, the first\r\never made in Rome, and allowed him to vote in whatever tribe he chose to\r\nbe enrolled. The other freedmen were not allowed the suffrage till, long\r\nafter, it was given them by Appius to obtain popularity among them. The\r\nwhole ceremony is up to the present day called _vindicta_, after\r\nVindicius, we are told.\r\n\r\nVIII. After this they allowed the king's property to be plundered, and\r\ndestroyed the palace. Tarquinius had obtained the pleasantest part of\r\nthe Field of Mars, and had consecrated it to that god. This field had\r\njust been cut, and the corn lay on the ground, for the people thought\r\nthat they must not thresh it or make any use of it, because of the\r\nground being consecrated, so they took the sheaves and threw them into\r\nthe river. In the same way they cut down the trees and threw them in,\r\nleaving the whole place for the god, but uncultivated and unfruitful.\r\nAs there were many things of different sorts all floating together in\r\nthe river, the current did not carry them far, but when the first masses\r\nsettled on a shallow place, the rest which were carried down upon them\r\ncould not get past, but became heaped up there, and the stream compacted\r\nthem securely by the mud which it deposited upon them, not only\r\nincreasing the size of the whole mass, but firmly cementing it together.\r\nThe waves did not shake it, but gently beat it into a solid consistency.\r\nNow, from its size, it began to receive additions, as most of what the\r\nriver brought down settled upon it. It is now a sacred island close by\r\nthe city, with temples and walks, and in the Latin tongue it has a name\r\nwhich means \"between two bridges.\" Some state that this did not happen\r\nwhen Tarquinia's field was consecrated, but in later times when\r\nTarquinia gave up another field next to that one, for the public use.\r\nThis Tarquinia was a priestess, one of the Vestal virgins, and she was\r\ngreatly honoured for having done so, and was allowed to appear as a\r\nwitness in court, which no other woman could do; she also was permitted\r\nto marry, by a decree of the senate, but did not avail herself of it.\r\nThese are the legends which they tell about this island.\r\n\r\nIX. Tarquin now gave up all hopes of recovering his throne by intrigue,\r\nand appealed to the Etruscans, who willingly espoused his cause and\r\nendeavoured to restore him with a great army. The consuls led out the\r\nRomans to fight against them, posting them in holy places one of which\r\nis called the Arsian grove, and another the Aesuvian meadow. When they\r\nwere about to join battle, Aruns, the son of Tarquin, and Brutus, the\r\nRoman consul, attacked one another, not by chance, but with fell hatred\r\nand rage, the one urging his horse against the tyrant and enemy of his\r\ncountry, the other against the man who drove him into exile. Falling\r\nupon one another with more fury than judgment, they made no attempt to\r\ndefend themselves, but only to strike, and both perished. The struggle,\r\nso terribly begun, was continued with equal ferocity on both sides,\r\nuntil the armies, after great losses, were separated by a tempest.\r\nValerius was in great straits, not knowing how the battle had gone, and\r\nobserving that his soldiers were despondent when they looked at the\r\ncorpses of their comrades, and elated when they saw those of the enemy,\r\nso equal and undecided had been the slaughter. Yet each side, when it\r\nviewed its own dead close by, was more inclined to own itself defeated,\r\nthan to claim the victory because of the supposed losses of the enemy.\r\nNight came on, and it was spent as may be imagined by men who had fought\r\nso hard. When all was quiet in both camps, we are told that the grove\r\nwas shaken, and that from it proceeded a loud voice which declared that\r\nthe Etruscans had lost one man more than the Romans. Apparently it was\r\nthe voice of a god; for immediately the Romans raised a bold and joyous\r\nshout, and the Etruscans, panic-stricken, ran out of their camp and\r\ndispersed. The Romans attacked the camp, took prisoners all that were\r\nleft in it, something less than five thousand, and plundered it. The\r\ndead, when counted, proved to be eleven thousand three hundred of the\r\nenemy, and of the Romans the same number save one. This battle is said\r\nto have been fought on the Calends of March. Valerius triumphed after it\r\nin a four-horse chariot, being the first consul that ever did so. And it\r\nwas a magnificent sight, and did not, as some say, offend the\r\nspectators; for, if so, the habit of doing it would not have been so\r\ncarefully kept up for so many years. The people were also pleased with\r\nthe honours which Valerius paid to his colleague in arranging a splendid\r\nfuneral for him; he also pronounced a funeral oration over him, which\r\nwas so much approved of by the Romans that from that day forth it became\r\nthe custom for all good and great men at their deaths to have an oration\r\nmade over them by the leading men of the time. This is said to have been\r\nolder even than the Greek funeral orations, unless, as Anaximenes tells\r\nus, Solon introduced this custom.\r\n\r\nX. But the people were vexed and angry, because though Brutus, whom they\r\nthought the author of their liberty, would not be consul alone, but had\r\none colleague after another, yet \"Valerius,\" they said, \"has got all\r\npower into his own hands, and is not so much the heir of the consulship\r\nof Brutus as of the tyranny of Tarquin. And what use is it for him to\r\npraise Brutus while he imitates Tarquin in his deeds, swaggering down\r\ninto the Forum with all the rods and axes before him, from a house\r\nlarger than the king's palace used to be.\" Indeed, Valerius lived in\r\nrather too splendid a house on the Velian Hill, looking down into the\r\nForum, and difficult to climb up to, so that when he walked down from it\r\nhe did indeed look like a tragedy king leaving his palace. But now he\r\nproved how valuable a thing it is for a statesman engaged in important\r\nmatters to keep his ears open to the truth, and shut against flattery.\r\nHearing from his friends what the people thought of him, he did not\r\nargue or grieve at it, but suddenly assembled a number of workmen and\r\nduring the night destroyed his entire house down to the very\r\nfoundations, so that on the next day the Romans collected in crowds to\r\nsee it, admiring the magnanimity of the man, but sorrowing at the\r\ndestruction of so great and noble a house, which, like many a man, had\r\nbeen put to death undeservedly, and expressing their concern for their\r\nconsul, who had no house to live in. Valerius, indeed, had to be\r\nentertained by his friends, until the people gave him a site and built\r\nhim a house upon it, of more moderate proportions than the other, in the\r\nplace where at the present day stands the temple of Vica Pota. Wishing\r\nto make not only himself but his office cease to be an object of terror\r\nto his countrymen, he removed the axes from the bundles of rods carried\r\nby the lictors, and when he entered the assembly of the people he\r\nordered his _fasces_ to be bowed and lowered before them, to show\r\nrespect to the majesty of the people. This custom the consuls observe to\r\nthis day. By these acts he did not really humble himself as he appeared\r\nto the Romans to be doing, but he so completely destroyed any illwill\r\nwhich had been felt against him that by giving up the semblance of power\r\nhe really gained the reality, as the people were eager to serve him and\r\nobey him. For this reason they surnamed him _Poplicola_, which means\r\n\"lover of the people,\" and this name so took the place of his former one\r\nthat we shall use it during the remainder of this account of his life.\r\n\r\nXI. He permitted any one to become a candidate for the consulship; and\r\nwhile he was sole consul he used his power to effect the greatest of his\r\nreforms, because he did not know who his new colleague might be, and\r\nwhether he would not thwart him through ignorance or illwill. First of\r\nall he brought up the senate to its proper number, for many senators had\r\nperished, some at Tarquin's hands in former years, and some in the late\r\nbattle. It is said that he elected no less than a hundred and sixty-four\r\nnew senators. After this, he enacted laws which greatly added to the\r\npower of the people, the first one of which gave accused persons a power\r\nof appeal from the decision of the consuls to the people. The second\r\nappointed the penalty of death to those who entered upon any public\r\noffice without the consent of the people. The third was to assist the\r\npoor, as it relieved them from taxes and enabled them all to apply\r\nthemselves with greater assiduity to trade. The law, too, which he\r\nenacted about disobedience to the consuls is no less popular in its\r\nspirit, and favours the people more than the great nobles. He assessed\r\nthe fine for disobedience at the price of five oxen and two sheep. Now\r\nthe value of a sheep was ten obols, and that of an ox a hundred, for at\r\nthis period the Romans did not make much use of coined money, but\r\npossessed abundance of cattle. For this reason at this day they call\r\nproperty _peculia_, from _pecus_, a sheep, and on their oldest coins\r\nthey marked the figure of an ox, a sheep, or a pig. Their children, too,\r\nwere distinguished by the names of Suillii, Bubulci, Caprarii and\r\nPorcii, for _capra_ means a goat, and _porcus_ a pig.\r\n\r\nXII. Though Poplicola favoured the people so much in these laws, and\r\nshowed such great moderation, yet in one instance he appointed a\r\nterrible penalty. One of his laws enacted that any citizen was at\r\nliberty to put to death anyone who tried to make himself king, without\r\nany form of trial. No penalty was to be enforced, if the man could bring\r\nforward proofs of the other's intention. His reason for this was that it\r\nwas impossible for any one to attempt to make himself king, unperceived\r\nby some of his countrymen, but quite possible for him, although\r\ndetected, to become too powerful to be brought to trial. So, before he\r\nmade his attempt on the crown, any one was at liberty to exact from him\r\nthat penalty, which he would be unable to do after his success.\r\n\r\nHis law about the treasury was also much approved. It being necessary\r\nthat the citizens should contribute taxes to carry on the war, as he did\r\nnot wish to touch the revenue himself or to allow his friends to do so,\r\nand was even unwilling that the public money should be brought into a\r\nprivate man's house, he appointed the Temple of Saturn to be used as a\r\ntreasury, which it is to this day, and he appointed also two of the\r\nyounger citizens as quaestors, to manage the accounts. The first\r\nquaestors were Publius Venturius and Marcus Minucius, and a large sum of\r\nmoney was collected, for a hundred and thirty thousand persons were\r\ntaxed, although orphans and widows were exempted.\r\n\r\nWhen he had settled all these matters, he nominated Lucretius, the\r\nfather of Lucretia, as his colleague, and gave up the _fasces_ to him as\r\na mark of respect, because he was the elder man. This custom, that the\r\nelder of the two consuls has the _fasces_ carried before him, remains to\r\nthis day. As Lucretius died shortly afterwards, a new election took\r\nplace, and Marcus Horatius was elected, and acted as Poplicola's\r\ncolleague for the remainder of his year of office.\r\n\r\nXIII. As Tarquin was stirring up the Etruscans to a second war with\r\nRome, a great portent is said to have taken place. While he was yet\r\nking, and had all but finished the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, he,\r\neither in accordance with some prophecy or otherwise, ordered certain\r\nEtruscan workmen at Veii to make an earthenware four-horse chariot to be\r\nplaced on the top of the temple. Shortly afterwards he was driven from\r\nthe throne, and the chariot, which had been modelled in clay, was placed\r\nin the furnace. Here it did not, as clay generally does, shrink and\r\nbecome smaller in the fire, as the wet dries out of it, but swelled to\r\nso great a size, and became so hard and strong that it could only be got\r\nout of the furnace by taking off the roof and sides. As this was decided\r\nby the prophets to be a sign from Heaven that those who possessed the\r\nchariot would be prosperous and fortunate, the Veientines determined not\r\nto give it up to the Romans, arguing that it belonged to Tarquin, not to\r\nthose who had cast him out.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards there were horse-races there; everything\r\nproceeded as usual, but as the driver of the winning chariot, after\r\nreceiving his crown as victor, was driving slowly out of the circus, the\r\nhorses suddenly became excited for no apparent cause, and, either guided\r\nby Heaven or by chance, rushed towards Rome, their driver with them, for\r\nhe finding it impossible to stop them was forced to let them whirl him\r\nalong until they reached the Capitol, where they threw him down near\r\nwhat is called the Ratumenan Gate. The Veientines, struck with fear and\r\nwonder at this event, permitted the workmen to deliver up the\r\nearthenware chariot to the Romans.\r\n\r\nXIV. Tarquinius the son of Demaratus, when at war with the Sabines,\r\nvowed that he would build the temple of Jupiter Olympius, but it was\r\nbuilt by Tarquinius Superbus, the son or grandson of him who made the\r\nvow. He had not time to dedicate it, but was dethroned just before its\r\ncompletion. Now when it was finished and thoroughly decorated, Poplicola\r\nwas eager to have the glory of dedicating it. Many of the nobles,\r\nhowever, grudged him this, and were more incensed at this than at all\r\nthe glory which he had won as a general and as a legislator; for _that_,\r\nthey said, was his vocation, but _this_ was not. They stirred up\r\nHoratius to oppose him and urged him to claim the right to dedicate the\r\ntemple. So when Poplicola was of necessity absent on military service,\r\nthe senate decreed that Horatius should dedicate it, and brought him up\r\ninto the Capitol to do so, a thing which they never could have done had\r\nPoplicola been present. Some say that the two consuls casts lots, and\r\nthat the one, sorely against his will, drew the lot to command the army\r\nin the field, and the other that to dedicate the temple. But we may\r\nconjecture how this was, from the events which took place at the\r\ndedication. On the Ides of September, which corresponds with the full\r\nmoon in our month Metageitnion, all the people assembled in the Capitol,\r\nand Horatius, after silence had been enjoined upon all, performed the\r\nceremony of dedication. When, as is customary, he was about to take hold\r\nof the doors of the temple and say the prayer of dedication, Marcus,\r\nPoplicola's brother, who had long been standing near the doors watching\r\nhis opportunity, said to him, \"Consul, your son has just died of\r\nsickness in the camp.\" All who heard this were grieved, but Horatius,\r\nundisturbed, merely said, \"Fling his corpse where you please, for I\r\ncannot grieve for him,\" and completed the dedication service. The story\r\nwas false, invented by Marcus to confuse Horatius. His conduct is a\r\nremarkable instance of presence of mind, whether it be that he at once\r\nsaw through the trick, or believed the story and was not disturbed by\r\nit.\r\n\r\nXV. The same fortune seems to have attended the second temple also. The\r\nfirst, as we have related, was built by Tarquin, and dedicated by\r\nHoratius. This was destroyed by fire in the civil wars. The second was\r\nbuilt by Sulla, but the name of Catulus appears as its dedicator, for\r\nSulla died before it was completed. This again was burned during the\r\ncivil tumults in the time of Vitellius, and Vespasian built a third,\r\nwhich had nearly the same fortune as the others, except that he saw it\r\ncompleted, and did not see it shortly afterwards destroyed, being thus\r\nmore fortunate than Tarquin in seeing the completion, and than Sulla in\r\nseeing the dedication of his work. When Vespasian died the Capitol was\r\nburned. The fourth and present temple was built and dedicated by\r\nDomitian. It is said that Tarquin spent forty thousand pounds of silver\r\nin building the foundations; but there is no private citizen in Rome at\r\nthe present day who could bear the expense of gilding the existing\r\ntemple, which cost more than twelve thousand talents. Its columns are of\r\nPentelic marble, exquisitely proportioned, which I myself saw at Athens;\r\nbut at Rome they were again cut and polished, by which process they did\r\nnot gain so much in gloss as they lost in symmetry, for they now appear\r\ntoo slender. However, if any one who wonders at the expense of the\r\ntemple in the Capitol were to see the splendour of any one portico,\r\nhall, or chamber in the house of Domitian, he would certainly be led to\r\nparody that line of Epicharmus upon an extravagant fellow,\r\n\r\n    \"Not good-natured, but possessed with the disease of giving,\"\r\n\r\nand would say that Domitian was not pious or admirable, but possessed\r\nwith the disease of building, and turned everything into bricks and\r\nmortar, just as it is said Midas turned things into gold. So much for\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nXVI. Tarquin, after the great battle in which his son was slain by\r\nBrutus, took refuge at Clusium and begged Lars Porsena, the most\r\npowerful king in Italy, to assist him. He was thought to be an\r\nhonourable and ambitious man, and promised his aid. First he sent an\r\nembassy to Rome, ordering them to receive Tarquin; and when the Romans\r\nrefused to obey, he declared war against them, and telling them at what\r\nplace and time he would attack them, marched against them with a great\r\narmy. At Rome, Poplicola, though absent, was chosen consul for the\r\nsecond time, and with him, Titus Lucretius. He returned to Rome, and by\r\nway of putting a slight upon Porsena, went and founded the city of\r\nSigliuria, while his army was close at hand. He built the walls of this\r\nplace at a vast expense, and sent away seven hundred colonists to it, as\r\nif the war with which he was menaced was a very unimportant matter. But,\r\nnevertheless, Porsena made a sharp assault upon the walls of Rome, drove\r\naway the garrison, and very nearly entered the town. Poplicola\r\nforestalled him by sallying from one of the gates, and fought by the\r\nbanks of the Tiber against overwhelming numbers until he was severely\r\nwounded and had to be carried out of the battle. As the same fate befell\r\nhis colleague Lucretius, the Romans lost heart and endeavoured to save\r\nthemselves by flight into the town. As the enemy also began to push\r\nacross the wooden bridge, Rome was in danger of being taken. But\r\nHoratius, surnamed Cocles, and with him two of the noblest citizens,\r\nnamed Herminius and Lartius, held the wooden bridge against them. This\r\nHoratius was surnamed Cocles because he had lost an eye in the wars, or\r\nas some say because of the flatness of his nose, which made his eyes and\r\neyebrows seem to meet, having nothing to separate them, and therefore\r\nthe people meaning to call him Cyclops, by a mistake of pronunciation,\r\nnamed him Cocles. This man stood at the end of the bridge and kept off\r\nthe enemy until his friends behind had cut down the bridge. Then he\r\nplunged into the river in his armour and swam to the other bank, though\r\nwounded by an Etruscan spear in the thigh. Poplicola, in admiration of\r\nhis valour, at once proposed and passed a decree that every Roman should\r\ngive him the price of one day's provisions. Moreover, he gave him as\r\nmuch land as he could plough in one day. And a brazen statue of him was\r\nplaced in the temple of Vulcan, by which honourable allusion was made to\r\nthe lameness caused by his wound.\r\n\r\nXVII. As Porsena pressed the siege, the Romans suffered from famine, and\r\nanother separate army of Etruscans invaded their territory. But\r\nPoplicola, who was now consul for the third time, though he thought it\r\nhis chief duty to remain stedfast and hold out the city against Porsena,\r\ndid nevertheless sally out and attack these men, routing them with a\r\nloss of five thousand. Now as to the legend of Mucius, it is told in\r\nmany different ways, but I will relate it as it seems most probable that\r\nit happened. He was a man of great courage, and very daring in war, who,\r\nmeaning to assassinate Porsena, stole into the camp in an Etruscan dress\r\nand speaking the Etruscan language. When he arrived at the raised\r\nplatform on which the king was sitting, he did not exactly know which\r\nwas he, and being afraid to ask, he drew his sword and killed the man\r\nwho of all the party looked most as if he were the king. Hereupon, he\r\nwas seized and questioned. A fire was burning close by in a brazier\r\nwhich had been brought for Porsena to offer sacrifice. Mucius held his\r\nright hand over this, and while the flesh was being consumed looked at\r\nPorsena cheerfully and calmly, until he in astonishment acquitted him\r\nand restored him his sword, which Mucius took with his left hand. On\r\naccount of this he is said to have been named _Scaevola_, which means\r\nleft-handed. He then said that though he did not fear Porsena, he was\r\nconquered by his generosity, and out of kindness would tell him what\r\ntorture would have failed to extort: \"Three hundred young Romans\r\nlike-minded with myself are at present concealed in your camp. I was\r\nchosen by lot to make the first attempt, and am not grieved that I\r\nfailed to kill a man of honour, who ought to be a friend rather than an\r\nenemy to the Romans.\" Porsena, hearing this, believed it to be true, and\r\nbecame much more inclined to make peace, not, I imagine, so much for\r\nfear of the three hundred, as out of admiration for the spirit and\r\nvalour of the Romans. This Mucius is called Scaevola by all writers, but\r\nAthenodorus, the son of Sandon, in his book which is dedicated to\r\nOctavia, the sister of Caesar Augustus, says that he was also named\r\nPosthumus.\r\n\r\nXVIII. Poplicola, who did not think Porsena so terrible as an enemy as\r\nhe would be valuable as a friend and ally, was willing that he should\r\ndecide the quarrel between the Romans and Tarquin, and often proposed\r\nthat he should do so, feeling sure that he would discover him to be a\r\nwretch who had been most deservedly dethroned. But Tarquin roughly\r\nanswered that he would submit his claims to no judge, and least of all\r\nto Porsena, who had been his ally and now seemed inclined to desert him.\r\nPorsena was angered at this, and, as his son Aruns also pleaded hard for\r\nthe Romans, put an end to the war upon condition that they should give\r\nup the portion of Etruscan territory which they had seized, restore\r\ntheir prisoners, and receive back their deserters. Upon this, ten youths\r\nof the noblest families were given as hostages, and as many maidens,\r\namong whom was Valeria, the daughter of Poplicola.\r\n\r\nXIX. While these negotiations were going on, and Porsena, through his\r\nconfidence in the good faith of the Romans, had relaxed the discipline\r\nof his camp, these Roman maidens came down to bathe in the river at a\r\nplace where a bank, in the form of a crescent, makes the water smooth\r\nand undisturbed. As they saw no guards, nor any one passing except in\r\nboats, they determined to swim across, although the stream was strong\r\nand deep. Some say that one of them, by name Cloelia, rode on a horse\r\nacross the river, encouraging the others as they swam. When they had got\r\nsafe across they went to Poplicola, but he was displeased with them\r\nbecause it made him seem more faithless than Porsena, and he feared lest\r\nthis daring feat of the maidens might be suspected of being a\r\npreconcerted plot of the Romans. For these reasons he sent them back to\r\nPorsena. Now Tarquin and his party, foreseeing that this would be done,\r\nlaid an ambush on the further bank and attacked those who were\r\nescorting the girls with superior numbers. Still they made a stout\r\ndefence, and meanwhile Valeria, the daughter of Poplicola, made her way\r\nthrough the combatants and escaped, and three slaves who also got away\r\ntook care of her. The others were mixed up with the fight, and were in\r\nconsiderable danger, when Aruns, Porsena's son, came to the rescue, put\r\nthe enemy to the rout, and saved the Romans. When the girls were brought\r\nbefore Porsena, he asked which it was that had conceived the attempt to\r\nescape and encouraged the others. Being told that it was Cloelia, he\r\nsmiled kindly upon her, and presented her with one of his own horses,\r\nsplendidly caparisoned. This is relied upon by those who say that it was\r\nCloelia alone who rode on horseback over the river, as proving their\r\ncase. Others say that it was not because she used a horse, but to honour\r\nher manly spirit that the Etruscan king made her this present. A statue\r\nof her, on horseback, stands in the Sacred Way as you go up to the\r\nPalatine Hill, which by some is said not to be a statue of Cloelia, but\r\nof Valeria.\r\n\r\nPorsena, after making peace with the Romans, among many other instances\r\nof generosity, ordered his army to carry back nothing but their arms\r\nwhen they retired, leaving the entrenched camp full of food and property\r\nof every kind for the Romans. For this reason, at the present day,\r\nwhenever there is a sale of any public property, especially that which\r\nis taken in war, proclamation is always made, \"Porsena's goods for\r\nsale,\" so that the Romans have never forgotten the kindness which they\r\nreceived from him. A brazen statue of him used to stand near the senate\r\nhouse, of plain and oldfashioned workmanship.\r\n\r\nXX. After this the Sabines invaded the country. Marcus Valerius,\r\nPoplicola's brother, and Posthumius Tubertus were then consuls, and\r\nMarcus, acting by the advice of Poplicola, who was present, won two\r\ngreat battles, in the second of which he slew thirteen thousand of the\r\nenemy without the Romans losing a man. He was rewarded for this, in\r\naddition to his triumph, by having a house built for him upon the\r\nPalatine Hill at the public expense. And whereas all other street doors\r\nopen inwards, the doors of that house were made to open outwards, as a\r\nperpetual memorial of the honour paid him by the people, who thus made\r\nway for him. It is said that all the doors in Greece used once to open\r\nthis way, arguing from the comedies, in which those who are coming out\r\nof a house always knock at the door, to warn those who are passing or\r\nstanding near not to be struck by the leaves of the door, as they open.\r\n\r\nXXI. Next year Poplicola was consul for the fourth time. There was an\r\nexpectation of a war against the Latins and Sabines combined.\r\n\r\nMoreover the city seemed to have displeased the gods; for all the\r\npregnant women were delivered prematurely, and of imperfectly formed\r\nchildren. Poplicola, after appeasing the gods below according to the\r\ninjunctions of the Sibylline books, re-established certain games in\r\naccordance with an oracle, brought the city into a more hopeful state of\r\nmind, and began to consider what he had to fear from earthly foes, for\r\nthe enemy's army was large and formidable. There was one Appius Clausus,\r\na Sabine, of great wealth and remarkable personal strength, and a\r\nvirtuous and eloquent man, who, like all great men, was the object of\r\nenvy and ill-will to many. He was accused by his enemies of having put\r\nan end to the war, because he wished to increase the power of Rome, in\r\norder to enable him the more easily to triumph over the liberties of his\r\nown country, and make himself king of it. Perceiving that the populace\r\neagerly listened to these tales, and that he was an object of dislike to\r\nthe war party and the army, he began to fear impeachment: so, having\r\nnumerous followers, besides his personal friends and relatives, he was\r\nable to divide the state into two parties. This caused great delay in\r\nthe Sabines' preparations for attacking the Romans, and Poplicola,\r\nfeeling it to be his duty not merely to watch but to assist Clausus,\r\nsent envoys, who spoke to him as follows: \"Poplicola feels that you are\r\na man of honour, who would be unwilling to take vengeance upon your\r\ncountrymen, although you have been shamefully treated by them. But if\r\nyou choose to put yourself in safety by leaving your country and a\r\npeople that hates you, he will receive you, both in his public and his\r\nprivate capacity, in a manner worthy of your own high character and of\r\nthe dignity of Rome.\" After much deliberation, Clausus decided that he\r\ncould not do better than accept this offer, and assembled all his\r\nfriends. They in their turn influenced many others, so that he was able\r\nto transplant to Rome five thousand of the most peaceful and respectable\r\nfamilies of the Sabine nation. Poplicola, who had notice of their\r\narrival, welcomed them kindly and graciously. He made them all citizens\r\nof Rome, and gave each of them two acres of land along the river Anio.\r\nHe gave Clausus twenty-five acres, and enrolled him among the Senators.\r\nClausus afterwards became one of the first men in Rome for wisdom and\r\npower, and his descendants, the Claudian family, was one of the most\r\nillustrious in history.\r\n\r\nXXII. Though the disputes of the Sabines were settled by this migration,\r\nyet their popular orators would not let them rest, but vehemently urged\r\nthat they ought not to let Appius, a deserter and an enemy, prevail upon\r\nthem to let the Romans go unpunished--a thing which he could not\r\npersuade them to do when he was present among them. They proceeded to\r\nFidenae with a great army and encamped there, and laid two thousand men\r\nin ambush before Rome, in wooded and broken ground, meaning in the\r\nmorning to send out a few horsemen to plunder ostentatiously. These men\r\nwere ordered to ride up close to Rome, and then to retire till their\r\npursuers were drawn into the snare. Poplicola heard of this plan the\r\nsame day from deserters, and quickly made all necessary arrangements. At\r\nevening he sent Postumius Balbus, his son-in-law, with three thousand\r\nmen to occupy the tops of the hills under which the Sabine ambush was\r\nplaced. His colleague, Lucretius, was ordered to take the\r\nswiftest-footed and noblest youth of the city, and pursue the plundering\r\nhorsemen, while he himself with the rest of the forces made a circuitous\r\nmarch and outflanked the enemy. It chanced that a thick mist came on\r\nabout dawn, in the midst of which Postumius charged down from the hills\r\nupon the men in ambush with a loud shout, while Lucretius sent his men\r\nto attack the cavalry, and Poplicola fell upon the enemy's camp. The\r\nSabines were routed in every quarter, and even when fighting no longer\r\nwere cut down by the Romans, their rash confidence proving ruinous to\r\nthem. Each party thought that the others must be safe, and did not care\r\nto stay and fight where they were, but those who were in the camp ran to\r\nthose in the ambush, and those in the ambush towards the camp, each of\r\nthem meeting those with whom they hoped to take refuge, and finding that\r\nthose who they had hoped would help them needed help themselves. The\r\nSabines would have been all put to the sword, had not the neighbouring\r\ncity of Fidenae afforded them a refuge, especially for the men from the\r\ncamp. Such as could not reach Fidenae were either put to death or taken\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nXXIII. The Romans, accustomed as they are to refer all great success to\r\nthe intervention of Heaven, thought that the whole glory of this\r\nachievement was due to the general. The first thing heard was the\r\nvictorious soldiers declaring that Poplicola had delivered up the enemy\r\nto them blind and lame, and all but in chains, for them to slaughter at\r\ntheir ease. The people were enriched by the plunder and the sale of the\r\nprisoners for slaves. Poplicola enjoyed a triumph, and previously\r\ndelivering over the administration of the city to the two succeeding\r\nconsuls, died shortly afterwards, having attained to the highest pitch\r\nof glory that man can reach. The people, as if they had done nothing\r\nduring his life to honour him as he deserved, and were now for the first\r\ntime to show their gratitude, decreed him a public funeral, and moreover\r\nthat every person should contribute the coin called _quadrans_, to show\r\nhim respect. The women also made a common agreement to wear mourning for\r\nhim for a whole year. He was buried by a decree of the people within the\r\ncity near the place called Velia, and all his family were given the\r\nprivilege of burial there. At the present day not one of the family is\r\nactually buried there, but the corpse is carried thither, and laid down,\r\nwhile some one places a lighted torch under it for a moment, after which\r\nit is carried away. By this ceremony they claim the right, although they\r\nforego it, and bury the corpse outside the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF SOLON AND POPLICOLA.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. It is a point peculiar to this comparison, and which does not occur\r\nin any of the other Lives which I have written, that in turn one\r\nimitates and the other bears witness to his fellow's deeds. Observe, for\r\ninstance, Solon's definition of happiness before Croesus, how much\r\nbetter it suits Poplicola than Tellus. He says that Tellus was fortunate\r\nbecause of his good luck, his virtue, and his noble children; but yet he\r\nmakes no mention of him or of his children in his poetry, and he never\r\nwas a man of any renown, or held any high office.\r\n\r\nNow Poplicola's virtues made him the most powerful and glorious of the\r\nRomans during his life, and six hundred years after his death the very\r\nnoblest families of Rome, those named Publicola and Messala and\r\nValerius, are proud to trace their descent from him, even at the present\r\nday. Tellus, it is true, died like a brave man fighting in the ranks,\r\nbut Poplicola slew his enemies, which is much better than being killed\r\noneself, and made his country victorious by skill as a general and a\r\nstatesman, and, after triumphing and enjoying honours of every kind,\r\ndied the death which Solon thought so enviable. Besides, Solon, in his\r\nanswer to Mimnermus about the time of life, has written the verses:\r\n\r\n    \"To me may favouring Heaven send,\r\n    That all my friends may mourn my end,\"\r\n\r\nin which he bears witness to the good fortune of Poplicola; for he, when\r\nhe died, was mourned not only by all his friends and relations but by\r\nthe whole city, in which thousands wept for him, while all the women\r\nwore mourning for him as if he were a son or father of them all that\r\nthey had lost.\r\n\r\nSolon says in his poems,\r\n\r\n    \"I long for wealth, but not procured\r\n    By means unholy.\"\r\n\r\nNow Poplicola not only possessed wealth honourably acquired, but also\r\nwas able to spend it, much to his credit, in relieving the needy. Thus\r\nif Solon was the wisest, Poplicola was certainly the most fortunate of\r\nmen; for what Solon prayed for as the greatest blessing, Poplicola\r\npossessed and enjoyed to the end of his days.\r\n\r\nII. Thus has Solon done honour to Poplicola; and he again honoured Solon\r\nby regarding him as the best model a man could follow in establishing a\r\nfree constitution: for he took away the excessive power and dignity of\r\nthe consuls and made them inoffensive to the people, and indeed made use\r\nof many of Solon's own laws; as he empowered the people to elect their\r\nown consuls, and gave defendants a right of appeal to the people from\r\nother courts, just as Solon had done. He did not, like Solon, make two\r\nsenates, but he increased the existing one to nearly double its number.\r\nHis grounds for the appointment of quaestors was to give the consul\r\nleisure for more important matters, if he was an honest man; and if he\r\nwas a bad man, to remove the opportunity of fraud which he would have\r\nhad if he were supreme over the state and the treasury at once. In\r\nhatred of tyrants Poplicola exceeded Solon, for he fixed the penalty for\r\na man who might be proved to be attempting to make himself king, whereas\r\nthe Roman allowed any one to kill him without trial. And while Solon\r\njustly prided himself upon his having been offered the opportunity to\r\nmake himself despot, with the full consent of his fellow-countrymen, and\r\nyet having refused it, Poplicola deserves even greater credit for having\r\nbeen placed in an office of almost despotic power, and having made it\r\nmore popular, not using the privileges with which he was entrusted.\r\nIndeed Solon seems to have been the first to perceive that a people\r\n\r\n                        \"Obeys its rulers best,\r\n    When not too free, yet not too much opprest.\"\r\n\r\nIII. The relief of debtors was a device peculiar to Solon, which, more\r\nthan anything else confirmed the liberty of the citizens. For laws to\r\nestablish equality are of no use if poor men are prevented from enjoying\r\nit because of their debts; and in the states which appear to be the most\r\nfree, men become mere slaves to the rich, and conduct the whole business\r\nof the state at their dictation. It should be especially noted that\r\nalthough an abolition of debt would naturally produce a civil war, yet\r\nthis measure of Solon's, like an unusual but powerful dose of medicine,\r\nactually put an end to the existing condition of internal strife; for\r\nthe well-known probity of Solon's character outweighed the discredit of\r\nthe means to which he resorted. In fact Solon began his public life with\r\ngreater glory than Poplicola, for he was the leading spirit, and\r\nfollowed no man, but entirely single handed effected the most important\r\nreforms; while Poplicola was more enviable and fortunate at the close of\r\nhis career.\r\n\r\nSolon himself saw his own constitution overthrown, while that of\r\nPoplicola preserved order in the city down to the time of the civil\r\nwars; and the reason was that Solon, as soon as he had enacted his laws,\r\nwent on his travels, leaving them written on wooden tablets, defenceless\r\nagainst all assailants; whereas Poplicola remained at home, acted as\r\nconsul, and by his statesmanship ensured the success and permanence of\r\nthe new constitution. Moreover, Solon could not stop Peisistratus,\r\nalthough he perceived his designs, but was forced to see a despotism\r\nestablished; while Poplicola destroyed a monarchy which had existed for\r\nmany years, showing equal virtue with Solon, but greater good fortune\r\nand power to enable him to carry out his intentions.\r\n\r\nIV. With regard to warlike achievements, Daimachus of Plataea will not\r\neven admit that Solon made the campaign against the Megarians, which we\r\nhave related; but Poplicola both by strategy and personal valour won\r\nmany great battles. As a statesman, Solon seems to have acted somewhat\r\nchildishly in pretending that he was mad, in order to make his speech\r\nabout Salamis, while Poplicola ran the very greatest risks in driving\r\nout the tyrant and crushing the conspiracy. He was especially\r\nresponsible for the chief criminals being put to death, and thus not\r\nonly drove the Tarquins out of the city, but cut off and destroyed\r\ntheir hopes of return. And while he showed such vigour in enterprises\r\nthat required spirit and courage, he was equally admirable in peaceful\r\nnegotiations and the arts of persuasion; for he skilfully won over the\r\nformidable Porsena to be the friend instead of the enemy of Rome.\r\n\r\nStill we may be reminded that Solon stirred up the Athenians to capture\r\nSalamis, which they had given up to the Megarians, while Poplicola\r\nwithdrew the Romans from a country which they had conquered. We must,\r\nhowever, consider the circumstances under which these events took place.\r\nA subtle politician deals with every thing so as to turn it to the\r\ngreatest advantage, and will often lose a part in order to save the\r\nwhole, and by sacrificing some small advantage gain another more\r\nimportant one, as did Poplicola on that occasion; for he, by withdrawing\r\nfrom a foreign country, preserved his own, gained the enemy's camp for\r\nthe Romans, who before were only too glad to save their city from ruin,\r\nand at last, by converting his enemy into an arbitrator and winning his\r\ncause, obtained all the fruits of victory: for Porsena put an end to the\r\nwar, and left behind him all his war material to show his respect for\r\nthe noble character of the consul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF THEMISTOKLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Themistokles came of a family too obscure to entitle him to\r\ndistinction. His father, Neokles, was a middle-class Athenian citizen,\r\nof the township of Phrearri and the tribe Leontis. He was base born on\r\nhis mother's side, as the epigram tells us:\r\n\r\n    \"My name's Abrotonon from Thrace,\r\n    I boast not old Athenian race;\r\n    Yet, humble though my lineage be,\r\n    Themistokles was born of me.\"\r\n\r\nPhanias, however, says that the mother of Themistokles was a Carian, not\r\na Thracian, and that her name was not Abrotonon but Euterpe. Manthes\r\neven tells us that she came from the city of Halikarnassus in Caria. All\r\nbase-born Athenians were made to assemble at Kynosarges, a gymnasium\r\noutside the walls sacred to Herakles, who was regarded as base born\r\namong the gods because his mother was a mortal; and Themistokles induced\r\nseveral youths of noble birth to come to Kynosarges with him and join in\r\nthe wrestling there, an ingenious device for destroying the exclusive\r\nprivileges of birth. But, for all that, he evidently was of the blood of\r\nLykomedes; for when the barbarians burned down the temple of the\r\nInitiation at Phlya, which belonged to the whole race of the descendants\r\nof Lykomedes, it was restored by Themistokles, as we are told by\r\nSimonides.\r\n\r\nII. He is agreed by all to have been a child of vigorous impulses,\r\nnaturally clever, and inclined to take an interest in important affairs\r\nand questions of statesmanship. During his holidays and times of leisure\r\nhe did not play and trifle as other children do, but was always found\r\narranging some speech by himself and thinking it over. The speech was\r\nalways an attack on, or a defence of, some one of his playfellows. His\r\nschoolmaster was wont to say, \"You will be nothing petty, my boy; you\r\nwill be either a very good or a very bad man.\"\r\n\r\nIn his learning, he cared nothing for the exercises intended to form the\r\ncharacter, and mere showy accomplishments and graces, but eagerly\r\napplied himself to all real knowledge, trusting to his natural gifts to\r\nenable him to master what was thought to be too abstruse for his time of\r\nlife. In consequence of this, when in society he was ridiculed by those\r\nwho thought themselves well mannered and well educated, he was obliged\r\nto make the somewhat vulgar retort that he could not tune a lute or play\r\nupon the harp, but he could make a small and obscure state great and\r\nglorious.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this, Stesimbrotus says that Themistokles was a pupil of\r\nAnaxagoras, and attended the lectures of Melissus the physicist; but\r\nhere he is wrong as to dates. Melissus was the general who was opposed\r\nto Perikles, a much younger man than Themistokles, when he was besieging\r\nSamos, and Anaxagoras was one of Perikles's friends. One is more\r\ninclined to believe those who tell us that Themistokles was a follower\r\nand admirer of Mnesiphilus of Phrearri, who was neither an orator nor a\r\nnatural philosopher, but a man who had deeply studied what went by the\r\nname of wisdom, but was really political sharp practice and expedients\r\nof statesmanship, which he had, as it were, inherited as a legacy from\r\nSolon. Those who in later times mixed up this science with forensic\r\ndevices, and used it, not to deal with the facts of politics, but the\r\nabstract ideas of speculative philosophy, were named Sophists.\r\nThemistokles used to converse with this man when he had already begun\r\nhis political career. In his childhood he was capricious and unsteady,\r\nhis genius, as yet untempered by reason and experience, showing great\r\ncapacities both for good and evil, and after breaking out into vice, as\r\nhe himself used afterwards to admit, saying that the colts which are the\r\nhardest to break in usually make the most valuable horses when properly\r\ntaught. But as for the stories which some have fabricated out of this,\r\nabout his being disinherited by his father, and about his mother\r\ncommitting suicide through grief at her son's disgrace, they seem to be\r\nuntrue. On the other hand, some writers tell us that his father, wishing\r\nto dissuade him from taking part in politics, pointed out to him the old\r\ntriremes lying abandoned on the beach, and told him that politicians,\r\nwhen the people had no farther use for them, were cast aside in like\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nIII. Very early in life Themistokles took a vigorous part in public\r\naffairs, possessed by vehement ambition. Determined from the very outset\r\nthat he would become the leading man in the state, he eagerly entered\r\ninto all the schemes for displacing those who where then at the head of\r\naffairs, especially attacking Aristeides, the son of Lysimachus, whose\r\npolicy he opposed on every occasion. Yet his enmity with this man seems\r\nto have had a very boyish commencement; for they both entertained a\r\npassion for the beautiful Stesilaus, who, we are told by Ariston the\r\nphilosopher, was descended from a family residing in the island of Keos.\r\nAfter this difference they espoused different parties in the state, and\r\ntheir different temper and habits widened the breach between them.\r\nAristeides was of a mild and honourable nature, and as a statesman cared\r\nnothing for popularity or personal glory, but did what he thought right\r\nwith great caution and strict rectitude. He was thus often brought into\r\ncollision with Themistokles, who was trying to engage the people in many\r\nnew schemes, and to introduce startling reforms, by which he would\r\nhimself have gained credit, and which Aristeides steadily opposed.\r\n\r\nHe is said to have been so recklessly ambitious and so frenziedly eager\r\nto take part in great events, that though he was very young at the time\r\nof the battle of Marathon, when the country rang with the praises of the\r\ngeneralship of Miltiades, he was often to be seen buried in thought,\r\npassing sleepless nights and refusing invitations to wine-parties, and\r\nthat he answered those who asked him the cause of his change of habits,\r\nthat the trophies of Miltiades would not let him sleep. Other men\r\nthought that the victory of Marathon had put an end to the war, but\r\nThemistokles saw that it was but the prelude to a greater contest, in\r\nwhich he prepared himself to stand forth as the champion of Greece, and,\r\nforeseeing long before what was to come, endeavoured to make the city\r\nof Athens ready to meet it.\r\n\r\nIV. First of all, he had the courage to propose that the Athenians,\r\ninstead of dividing amongst themselves the revenues derived from the\r\nsilver mines at Laurium, should construct ships out of this fund for the\r\nwar with Aegina. This was then at its height, and the Aeginetans, who\r\nhad a large navy, were masters of the sea. By this means Themistokles\r\nwas more easily enabled to carry his point, not trying to terrify the\r\npeople by alluding to Darius and the Persians, who lived a long way off,\r\nand whom few feared would ever come to attack them, but by cleverly\r\nappealing to their feelings of patriotism against the Aeginetans, to\r\nmake them consent to the outlay.\r\n\r\nWith that money a hundred triremes were built, which were subsequently\r\nused to fight against Xerxes. After this he kept gradually turning the\r\nthoughts of the Athenians in the direction of the sea, because their\r\nland force was unable even to hold its own against the neighbouring\r\nstates, while with a powerful fleet they could both beat off the\r\nbarbarians and make themselves masters of the whole of Greece. Thus, as\r\nPlato says, instead of stationary soldiers as they were, he made them\r\nroving sailors, and gave rise to the contemptuous remark that\r\nThemistokles took away from the citizens of Athens the shield and the\r\nspear, and reduced them to the oar and the rower's bench. This, we are\r\ntold by Stesimbrotus, he effected after quelling the opposition of\r\nMiltiades, who spoke on the other side. Whether his proceedings at this\r\ntime were strictly constitutional or no I shall leave to others to\r\ndetermine; but that the only safety of Greece lay in its fleet, and that\r\nthose triremes were the salvation of the Athenians after their city was\r\ntaken, can be proved by the testimony, among others, of Xerxes himself;\r\nfor although his land force was unbroken, he fled after his naval\r\ndefeat, as though no longer able to contend with the Greeks, and he left\r\nMardonius behind more to prevent pursuit, in my opinion, than with any\r\nhopes of conquest.\r\n\r\nV. Some writers tell us that he was a keen man of business, and explain\r\nthat his grand style of living made this necessary; for he made costly\r\nsacrifices, and entertained foreigners in a splendid manner, all of\r\nwhich required a large expenditure; but some accuse him of meanness and\r\navarice, and even say that he sold presents which were sent for his\r\ntable. When Philides the horse-dealer refused to sell him a colt, he\r\nthreatened that he would soon make a wooden horse of the man's house;\r\nmeaning that he would stir up lawsuits and claims against him from some\r\nof his relations.\r\n\r\nIn ambition he surpassed every one. When yet a young and unknown man he\r\nprevailed upon Epikles of Hermione, the admired performer on the harp,\r\nto practise his art in his house, hoping thereby to bring many people to\r\nit to listen. And he displeased the Greeks when he went to the Olympian\r\ngames by vying with Kimon in the luxury of his table, his tents, and his\r\nother furniture. It was thought very proper for Kimon, a young man of\r\nnoble birth, to do so; but for a man who had not yet made himself a\r\nreputation, and had not means to support the expense, such extravagance\r\nseemed mere vulgar ostentation. In the dramatic contest, which even then\r\nexcited great interest and rivalry, the play whose expenses he paid for\r\nwon the prize. He put up a tablet in memory of his success bearing the\r\nwords: Themistokles of Phrearri was choragus, Phrynichus wrote the play,\r\nAdeimantus was archon. Yet he was popular, for he knew every one of the\r\ncitizens by name, and gave impartial judgment in all cases referred to\r\nhim as arbitrator. Once, when Simonides of Keos asked him to strain a\r\npoint in his favour, Themistokles, who was a general at the time,\r\nanswered that Simonides would be a bad poet if he sang out of tune; and\r\nhe would be a bad magistrate if he favoured men against the law. At\r\nanother time he rallied Simonides on his folly in abusing the\r\nCorinthians, who inhabited so fine a city, and in having his own statue\r\ncarved, though he was so ugly. He continued to increase in popularity by\r\njudiciously courting the favour of the people, and was at length able to\r\nsecure the triumph of his own party, and the banishment of his rival\r\nAristeides.\r\n\r\nVI. As the Persians were now about to invade Greece, the Athenians\r\ndeliberated as to who should be their leader. It is said that most men\r\nrefused the post of General through fear, but that Epikydes, the son of\r\nEuphemides, a clever mob-orator, but cowardly and accessible to bribes,\r\ndesired to be appointed, and seemed very likely to be elected.\r\nThemistokles, fearing that the state would be utterly ruined if its\r\naffairs fell into such hands, bribed him into forgetting his ambitious\r\ndesigns, and withdrawing his candidature.\r\n\r\nHe was much admired for his conduct when envoys came from the Persian\r\nking to demand earth and water, in token of submission. He seized the\r\ninterpreter, and by a decree of the people had him put to death, because\r\nhe had dared to translate the commands of a barbarian into the language\r\nof free Greeks. He acted in the same way to Arthmias of Zelea. This man,\r\nat the instance of Themistokles, was declared infamous, he and his\r\nchildren and his descendants for ever, because he brought Persian gold\r\namong the Greeks. His greatest achievement of all, however, was, that he\r\nput an end to all the internal wars in Greece, and reconciled the states\r\nwith one another, inducing them to defer the settlement of their feuds\r\nuntil after the Persian war. In this he is said to have been greatly\r\nassisted by Chileon the Arcadian.\r\n\r\nVII. On his appointment as General, he at once endeavoured to prevail\r\nupon his countrymen to man their fleet, leave their city, and go to meet\r\nthe enemy by sea as far from Greece as possible. As this met with great\r\nopposition, he, together with the Lacedaemonians, led a large force as\r\nfar as the Vale of Tempe, which they intended to make their first line\r\nof defence, as Thessaly had not at that time declared for the Persians.\r\nWhen, however, the armies were forced to retire from thence, and all\r\nGreece, up to Boeotia, declared for the Persians, the Athenians became\r\nmore willing to listen to Themistokles about fighting by sea, and he was\r\nsent with a fleet to guard the straits at Artemisium. Here the Greeks\r\nchose the Lacedaemonians, and their general, Eurybiades, to take the\r\ncommand; but the Athenians refused to submit to any other state, because\r\nthey alone furnished more ships than all the rest. Themistokles, at this\r\ncrisis perceiving the danger, gave up his claims to Eurybiades, and\r\nsoothed the wounded pride of the Athenians, telling them that if they\r\nproved themselves brave men in the war, they would find that all the\r\nother states in Greece would cheerfully recognise their supremacy. On\r\nthis account he seems more than any one else to deserve the credit of\r\nhaving saved Greece, and to have covered the Athenians with glory by\r\nteaching them to surpass their enemies in bravery, and their allies in\r\ngood sense. When the Persian fleet reached Aphetai, Eurybiades was\r\nterrified at the number of ships at the mouth of the Straits, and,\r\nlearning that two hundred sail more were gone round the outside of\r\nEuboea to take him in the rear, he at once wished to retire further into\r\nGreece, and support the fleet by the land army in Peloponnesus, for he\r\nregarded the Persian king's fleet as utterly irresistible at sea. Upon\r\nthis the Euboeans, who feared to be deserted by the Greeks, sent one\r\nPelagon with a large sum of money, to make secret proposals to\r\nThemistokles. He took the money, Herodotus tells us, and gave it to\r\nEurybiades and his party. One of those who most vehemently opposed him\r\nwas Architeles, the captain of the Sacred Trireme, who had not\r\nsufficient money to pay his crew, and therefore wished to sail back to\r\nAthens. Themistokles stirred up the anger of his men to such a pitch\r\nthat they rushed upon him and took away his supper. At this, Architeles\r\nwas much vexed, but Themistokles sent him a basket containing bread and\r\nmeat, with a talent of silver hidden underneath it, with a message\r\nbidding him eat his supper and pay his men the next day, but that, if he\r\ndid not, Themistokles would denounce him to his countrymen as having\r\nreceived bribes from the enemy. This we are told by Phanias of Lesbos.\r\n\r\nVIII. The battles which took place in the Straits with the Persian\r\nships, were indeed indecisive, but the experience gained in them was of\r\nthe greatest value to the Greeks, as they were taught by their result\r\nthat multitudes of ships and splendid ensigns, and the boastful\r\nwar-cries of barbarians, avail nothing against men who dare to fight\r\nhand to hand, and that they must disregard all these and boldly grapple\r\nwith their enemies. Pindar seems to have understood this when he says,\r\nabout the battle at Artemisium, that there\r\n\r\n             \"The sons of Athena laid\r\n    Their freedom's grand foundation.\"\r\n\r\nfor indeed confidence leads to victory. This Artemisium is a promontory\r\nof the island of Euboea, stretching northwards beyond Hestiaea; and\r\nopposite to it is Olizon, which was once part of the dominions of\r\nPhiloktetes. There is upon it a small temple of Artemis (Diana), which\r\nis called the \"Temple towards the East.\" Round it stand trees and a\r\ncircle of pillars of white stone. This stone, when rubbed in the hand,\r\nhas the colour and smell of saffron. On one of these pillars were\r\nwritten the following verses:\r\n\r\n    \"The sons of Athens once o'ercame in fight\r\n      All Asia's tribes, on yonder sea;\r\n    They raised these pillars round Diana's shrine,\r\n      To thank her for their victory.\"\r\n\r\nEven now a place is pointed out on the beach where, under a great heap\r\nof sand, there is a deep bed of black ashes where it is thought the\r\nwrecks and dead bodies were burned.\r\n\r\nIX. But when the news of Thermopylae was brought to the Greeks at\r\nArtemisium, that Leonidas had fallen, and Xerxes was in possession of\r\nthe passes, they retired further into Greece, the Athenians protecting\r\nthe rear on account of their bravery, and full of pride at their\r\nachievements. At all the harbours and landing-places along the coast,\r\nThemistokles, as he passed by, cut conspicuous inscriptions on stones,\r\nsome of which he found on the spot, and others which he himself set up\r\nat all the watering-places and convenient stations for ships. In these\r\ninscriptions he besought the Ionians, if possible, to come over to the\r\nAthenians, who were their fathers, and who were fighting for their\r\nliberty; and if they could not do this, to throw the barbarian army into\r\nconfusion during battle. He hoped that these writings would either bring\r\nthe Ionians over to the side of the Greeks, or make them suspected of\r\ntreason by the Persians.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Xerxes invaded Greece through Doris, and came into Phokis,\r\nwhere he burned the city of the Phokaeans. The Greeks made no\r\nresistance, although the Athenians begged them to make a stand in\r\nBoeotia, and cover Attica, urging that they had fought in defence of the\r\nwhole of Greece at Artemisium. However, as no one would listen to them,\r\nbut all the rest of the Greeks determined to defend the Peloponnesus,\r\nand were collecting all their forces within it, and building a wall\r\nacross the Isthmus from sea to sea, the Athenians were enraged at their\r\ntreachery, and disheartened at being thus abandoned to their fate. They\r\nhad no thoughts of resisting so enormous an army; and the only thing\r\nthey could do under the circumstances, to abandon their city and trust\r\nto their ships, was distasteful to the people, who saw nothing to be\r\ngained by victory, and no advantage in life, if they had to desert the\r\ntemples of their gods and the monuments of their fathers.\r\n\r\nX. At this crisis, Themistokles, despairing of influencing the populace\r\nby human reasoning, just as a dramatist has recourse to supernatural\r\nmachinery, produced signs and wonders and oracles. He argued that it was\r\na portent that the sacred snake during those days deserted his usual\r\nhaunt. The priests, who found their daily offerings to him of the first\r\nfruits of the sacrifices left untouched, told the people, at the\r\ninstigation of Themistokles, that the goddess Athena (Minerva) had left\r\nthe city, and was leading them to the sea. He also swayed the popular\r\nmind by the oracle, in which he argued that by \"wooden walls\" ships were\r\nalluded to; and that Apollo spoke of Salamis as \"divine,\" not terrible\r\nor sad, because Salamis would be the cause of great good fortune to the\r\nGreeks. Having thus gained his point, he proposed a decree, that the\r\ncity be left to the care of the tutelary goddess of the Athenians, that\r\nall able-bodied men should embark in the ships of war, and that each man\r\nshould take the best measures in his power to save the women and\r\nchildren and slaves.\r\n\r\nWhen this decree was passed, most of the Athenians sent their aged folks\r\nand women over to Troezen, where they were hospitably received by the\r\nTroezenians, who decreed that they should be maintained at the public\r\nexpense, receiving each two obols a day, that the children should be\r\nallowed to pick the fruit from any man's tree, and even that their\r\nschool expenses should be paid. This decree was proposed by Nikagoras.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians at this time had no public funds, yet Aristotle tells us\r\nthat the Senate of the Areopagus, by supplying each fighting man with\r\neight drachmas, did good service in manning the fleet; and Kleidemus\r\ntells us that this money was obtained by an artifice of Themistokles.\r\nWhen the Athenians were going down to the Peiraeus, he gave out that the\r\nGorgon's head had been lost from the statue of the goddess.\r\nThemistokles, under pretext of seeking for it, searched every man, and\r\nfound great stores of money hidden in their luggage, which he\r\nconfiscated, and thus was able to supply the crews of the ships with\r\nabundance of necessaries. When the whole city put to sea, the sight\r\naffected some to pity, while others admired their courage in sending\r\ntheir families out of the way that they might not be disturbed by\r\nweeping and wailing as they went over to Salamis. Yet many of the aged\r\ncitizens who were left behind at Athens afforded a piteous sight; and\r\neven the domestic animals, as they ran howling to the sea-shore,\r\naccompanying their masters, touched men's hearts. It is said that the\r\ndog of Xanthippus, the father of Perikles, could not endure to be\r\nseparated from him, and jumping into the sea swam alongside of his\r\ntrireme, reached Salamis, and then at once died. His tomb is even now to\r\nbe seen at the place called Kynossema.\r\n\r\nXI. Besides these great achievements, Themistokles, perceiving that his\r\ncountrymen longed to have Aristeides back again, and fearing that he\r\nmight ally himself with the Persian, and work ruin to Greece out of\r\nanger against his own country (for Aristeides had been banished from\r\nAthens before the war when Themistokles came into power), proposed a\r\ndecree, that any citizen who had been banished for a term of years,\r\nmight return and do his best by word and deed to serve his country\r\ntogether with the other citizens.\r\n\r\nEurybiades, on account of the prestige of Sparta, held the chief command\r\nof the fleet, but was unwilling to risk a battle, preferring to weigh\r\nanchor and sail to the Isthmus where the land army of the Peloponnesians\r\nwas assembled. This project was opposed by Themistokles; and it was on\r\nthis occasion that he made use of the following well-known saying: When\r\nEurybiades said to him, \"Themistokles, in the public games they whip\r\nthose who rise before their turn.\" \"True,\" said Themistokles, \"but they\r\ndo not crown those who lag behind.\" And when Eurybiades raised his\r\nstaff as if he would strike him, Themistokles said, \"Strike, but hear\r\nme.\" When Eurybiades, in wonder at his gentle temper, bade him speak, he\r\nagain urged Eurybiades to remain at Salamis. Some one then said, that a\r\nman without a city had no right to tell those who still possessed one to\r\nabandon it, but Themistokles turning upon him, answered, \"Wretch, we\r\nAthenians have indeed abandoned our walls and houses, because we scorn\r\nto be slaves for the sake of mere buildings, but we have the greatest\r\ncity of all Greece, our two hundred ships of war, which now are ready to\r\nhelp you if you choose to be saved by their means; but, if you betray us\r\nand leave us, some of the Greeks will soon learn to their cost that the\r\nAthenians have obtained a free city and a territory no worse than that\r\nwhich they left behind.\" When Eurybiades heard Themistokles use this\r\nlanguage, he began to fear that the Athenians might really sail away and\r\nleave him.\r\n\r\nWhen Eretrieus tried to say something to Themistokles, he answered, \"Do\r\nyou too dare to say anything about war, you, who like a cuttle-fish,\r\nhave a sword but no heart.\"\r\n\r\nXII. It is said by some writers that while Themistokles was talking\r\nabout these matters upon the deck of his ship, an owl was seen to fly\r\nfrom the right-hand side of the fleet, and to perch upon his mast; which\r\nomen encouraged all the Athenians to fight. But when the Persian host\r\npoured down to Phalerum, covering the whole sea-shore, and the king\r\nhimself was seen with all his forces, coming down to the beach with the\r\ninfantry, the Greeks forgot the words of Themistokles, and began to cast\r\neager glances towards the Isthmus and to be angry with any one who\r\nproposed to do anything else than withdraw. They determined to retire by\r\nnight, and the steersmen were given orders to prepare for a voyage.\r\nThemistokles, enraged at the idea of the Greek fleet dispersing, and\r\nlosing the advantage of the narrow waters, planned the affair of\r\nSikinnus. This Sikinnus was a Persian who had been taken prisoner, and\r\nwho was fond of Themistokles and took charge of his children. He sent\r\nthis man secretly to Xerxes, ordering him to say that Themistokles, the\r\ngeneral of the Athenians, has determined to come over to the king of the\r\nPersians, and is the first to tell him that the Greeks are about to\r\nretreat. He bids him not to allow them to fly, but to attack them while\r\nthey are disheartened at not being supported by a land force, and\r\ndestroy their fleet.\r\n\r\nXerxes, who imagined this to be said for his advantage, was delighted,\r\nand at once gave orders to the commanders of his ships to make ready for\r\nbattle at their leisure, all but two hundred, whom he ordered to put to\r\nsea at once, surround the whole strait, and close up the passages\r\nthrough the islands, so that no one of the enemy could escape. While\r\nthis was being done, Aristeides, the son of Lysimachus, who was the\r\nfirst to perceive it, came to the tent of Themistokles, although the\r\nlatter was his enemy, and had driven him into exile. When Themistokles\r\ncame to meet him, he told him they were surrounded; knowing the frank\r\nand noble character of Aristeides, Themistokles told him the whole plot,\r\nand begged him as a man in whom the Greeks could trust, to encourage\r\nthem to fight a battle in the straits. Aristeides praised Themistokles\r\nfor what he had done, and went round to the other generals and captains\r\nof ships, inciting them to fight. Yet they were inclined to doubt even\r\nthe word of Aristeides, when a trireme from the island of Tenos, under\r\nthe command of Panaitios, came in, having deserted from the enemy, and\r\nbrought the news that the Greeks were really surrounded. Then, in a\r\nspirit of anger and despair, they prepared for the struggle.\r\n\r\nXIII. At daybreak Xerxes took his seat on a high cliff overlooking all\r\nhis host, just above the Temple of Herakles, we are told by Phanodemus,\r\nwhere the strait between Salamis and Attica is narrowest, but according\r\nto Akestodorus, close to the Megarian frontier, upon the mountains\r\ncalled Horns. Here he sat upon the golden throne, with many scribes\r\nstanding near, whose duty it was to write down the events of the battle.\r\n\r\nWhile Themistokles was sacrificing on the beach, beside the admiral's\r\nship, three most beautiful captive boys were brought to him, splendidly\r\nadorned with gold and fine clothes. They were said to be the children of\r\nSandauke, the sister of Xerxes, and Artäuktes. When Euphrantides the\r\nprophet saw them, there shone at once from the victims on the altar a\r\ngreat and brilliant flame, and at the same time some one was heard to\r\nsneeze on the right hand, which is a good omen. Euphrantides now\r\nbesought Themistokles to sacrifice these young men as victims to\r\nDionysus, to whom human beings are sacrificed; so should the Greeks\r\nobtain safety and victory. Themistokles was struck with horror at this\r\nterrible proposal; but the multitude, who, as is natural with people in\r\ngreat danger, hoped to be saved by miraculous rather than by ordinary\r\nmeans, called upon the God with one voice, and leading the captives up\r\nto the altar, compelled him to offer them up as the prophet bade him.\r\nThis story rests on the authority of Phanias of Lesbos, who was a man of\r\neducation, and well read in history.\r\n\r\nXIV. As for the numbers of the Persian fleet, the poet Aeschylus, as\r\nthough he knew it clearly, writes as follows in his tragedy of the\r\nPersae:\r\n\r\n    \"And well I know a thousand sail\r\n      That day did Xerxes meet,\r\n    And seven and two hundred more,\r\n      The fastest of his fleet.\"\r\n\r\nThe Athenian ships, a hundred and eighty in number, had each eighteen\r\nmen on deck, four of whom were archers, and the rest heavy-armed\r\nsoldiers. Themistokles now chose the time for the battle as judiciously\r\nas he had chosen the place, and would not bring his triremes into line\r\nof battle before the fresh wind off the sea, as is usual in the morning,\r\nraised a heavy swell in the straits. This did not damage the low flat\r\nships of the Greeks, but it caught the high-sterned Persian ships,\r\nover-weighted as they were with lofty decks, and presented their\r\nbroadsides to the Greeks, who eagerly attacked them, watching\r\nThemistokles because he was their best example, and also because\r\nAriamenes, Xerxes's admiral, and the bravest and best of the king's\r\nbrothers, attacked him in a huge ship, from which, as if from a castle,\r\nhe poured darts and arrows upon him.\r\n\r\nBut Ameinias of Dekeleia and Sokles of Pedia, who were both sailing in\r\nthe same vessel, met him stem to stem. Each ship crashed into the other\r\nwith its iron beak, and was torn open. Ariamenes attempted to board the\r\nGreek ship, but these two men set upon him with their spears, and drove\r\nhim into the sea. His body was noticed by Queen Artemisia floating\r\namongst the other wreckage, and was by her brought to Xerxes.\r\n\r\nXV. At this period of the battle it is said that a great light was seen\r\nto shine from Eleusis, and that a great noise was heard upon the\r\nThriasian plain near the sea, as though multitudes of men were escorting\r\nthe mystic Iacchus in procession. From the place where these sounds were\r\nheard a mist seemed to spread over the sea and envelop the ships. Others\r\nthought that they saw spirit-forms of armed men come from Aegina, and\r\nhold their hands before the ships of the Greeks. These it was supposed\r\nwere the Aeakid heroes, to whom prayers for help had been offered just\r\nbefore the battle. The first man to capture a ship was Lykomedes, an\r\nAthenian captain, who cut off its ensign and dedicated it to Apollo with\r\nthe laurel crown at the Temple at Phlyae.\r\n\r\nIn the narrow straits the Persians were unable to bring more than a part\r\nof their fleet into action, and their ships got into each other's way,\r\nso that the Greeks could meet them on equal terms, and, although they\r\nresisted until evening, completely routed them, winning, as Simonides\r\ncalls it, that \"glorious and famous victory,\" the greatest exploit ever\r\nachieved at sea, which owed its success to the bravery of the sailors\r\nand the genius of Themistokles.\r\n\r\nXVI. After this naval defeat, Xerxes, enraged at his failure,\r\nendeavoured to fill up the strait with earth, and so to make a passage\r\nfor his land forces to Salamis, to attack the Greeks there. Now\r\nThemistokles, in order to try the temper of Aristeides, proposed that\r\nthe fleet should sail to the Hellespont, and break the bridge of boats\r\nthere, \"in order,\" said he, \"that we may conquer Asia in Europe.\" But\r\nAristeides disapproved of this measure, saying, \"Hitherto we have fought\r\nagainst the Persian king, while he has been at his ease; but if we shut\r\nhim up in Greece, and drive the chief of so large an army to despair, he\r\nwill no longer sit quietly under a golden umbrella to look on at his\r\nbattles, but will strain every nerve and superintend every operation in\r\nperson, and so will easily retrieve his losses and form better plans for\r\nthe future.\"\r\n\r\n\"Instead of breaking down the existing bridge for him, Themistokles,\"\r\nsaid he, \"we ought rather, if possible, at once to build another, and\r\nsend the man out of Europe as quickly as possible.\" \"Well then,\"\r\nanswered Themistokles, \"if you think that our interest lies in that\r\ndirection, we ought all to consider and contrive to send him out of\r\nGreece as fast as we can.\" When this resolution was adopted,\r\nThemistokles sent one of the king's eunuchs, whom he had found among the\r\nprisoners, bidding him warn Xerxes that \"the Greeks had determined after\r\ntheir victory to sail to the Hellespont and break the bridge, but that\r\nThemistokles, out of his regard for the king, advises him to proceed as\r\nfast as he can to his own sea, and cross over it, while he\r\n(Themistokles) gained time for him by delaying the allied fleet.\"\r\nXerxes, hearing thus, was much alarmed and retired in all haste. And\r\nindeed the battle with Mardonius at Plataea shows us which of the two\r\nwas right; for the Greeks there could scarcely deal with a small part of\r\nthe Persian army, and what therefore could they have done with the\r\nwhole?\r\n\r\nXVII. Herodotus tells us that, of Greek States, Aegina received the\r\nprize of valour, and that, of the generals, it was awarded to\r\nThemistokles, though against the will of the voters. When the armies\r\nretired to the Isthmus all the generals laid their votes on the altar\r\nthere, and each man declared himself to deserve the first prize for\r\nvalour, and Themistokles to deserve the second. However, the\r\nLacedaemonians brought him home with them to Sparta, and gave Eurybiades\r\nthe first prize for valour, but Themistokles that for wisdom, a crown of\r\nolive-leaves. They also gave him the best chariot in their city, and\r\nsent three hundred of their young men to escort him out of the country.\r\nIt is also related that at the next Olympian games, when Themistokles\r\nappeared upon the race-course, all the spectators took no further\r\ninterest in the contests, but passed the whole day in admiring and\r\napplauding him, and in pointing him out to such as were strangers; so\r\nthat he was delighted, and said to his friends that he had now received\r\nhis reward for all his labours on behalf of Greece.\r\n\r\nXVIII. He was by nature excessively fond of admiration, as we may judge\r\nfrom the stories about him which have been preserved. Once, when he was\r\nmade admiral of the Athenian fleet, he put off all the necessary\r\nbusiness of his office until the day appointed for sailing, in order\r\nthat he might have a great many dealings with various people all at\r\nonce, and so appear to be a person of great influence and importance.\r\nAnd when he saw the corpses floating in the sea with gold bracelets and\r\nnecklaces, he himself passed them by, but pointed them out to a friend\r\nwho was following, saying, \"Do you pick them up and keep them; for you\r\nare not Themistokles.\" A beautiful youth, named Antiphates, regarded him\r\ncoolly at first, but eventually became submissive to him because of his\r\nimmense reputation. \"Young man,\" said Themistokles, \"it has taken some\r\ntime, but we have at length both regained our right minds.\" He used to\r\nsay that the Athenians neither admired nor respected him, but used him\r\nlike a plane-tree under which they took shelter in storm, but which in\r\nfair weather they lopped and stripped of its leaves. Once when a citizen\r\nof Seriphos said to him that he owed his glory, not to himself but to\r\nhis city, he answered, \"Very true; I should not have become a great man\r\nif I had been a Seriphian, nor would you if you had been an Athenian.\"\r\nWhen one of his fellow-generals, who thought that he had done the state\r\ngood service, was taking a haughty tone, and comparing his exploits with\r\nthose of Themistokles, he said, \"The day after a feast, once upon a\r\ntime, boasted that it was better than the feast-day itself, because on\r\nthat day all men are full of anxiety and trouble, while upon the next\r\nday every one enjoys what has been prepared at his leisure. But the\r\nfeast-day answered, 'Very true, only but for me you never would have\r\nbeen at all.' So now,\" said he, \"if I had not come first, where would\r\nyou all have been now?\" His son, who was spoiled by his mother, and by\r\nhimself to please her, he said was the most powerful person in Greece;\r\nfor the Athenians ruled the Greeks, he ruled the Athenians, his wife\r\nruled him, and his son ruled his wife. Wishing to be singular in all\r\nthings, when he put up a plot of ground for sale, he ordered the crier\r\nto announce that there were good neighbours next to it. When two men\r\npaid their addresses to his daughter, he chose the more agreeable\r\ninstead of the richer of the two, saying that he preferred a man without\r\nmoney to money without a man. Such was his character, as shown in his\r\ntalk.\r\n\r\nXIX. Immediately after the great war, he began to rebuild and fortify\r\nthe city. In order to succeed in this, Theopompus says that he bribed\r\nthe Spartan ephors into laying aside opposition, but most writers say\r\nthat he outwitted them by proceeding to Sparta nominally on an embassy.\r\nThen when the Spartans complained to him that Athens was being\r\nfortified, and when Poliarchus came expressly from Aegina to charge him\r\nwith it, he denied it, and bade them send commissioners to Athens to see\r\nwhether it was true, wishing both to obtain time for the fortifications\r\nto be built, and also to place these commissioners in the hands of the\r\nAthenians, as hostages for his own safety. His expectations were\r\nrealised; for the Lacedaemonians, on discovering the truth, did him no\r\nharm, but dissembled their anger and sent him away. After this he built\r\nPeiraeus, as he perceived the excellence of its harbours, and was\r\ndesirous to turn the whole attention of the Athenians to naval pursuits.\r\nIn this he pursued a policy exactly the opposite to that of the ancient\r\nkings of Attica; for they are said to have endeavoured to keep their\r\nsubjects away from the sea, and to accustom them to till the ground\r\ninstead of going on board ships, quoting the legend that Athene and\r\nPoseidon had a contest for the possession of the land, and that she\r\ngained a decision in her favour by the production of the sacred olive.\r\nThemistokles, on the other hand, did not so much \"stick Peiraeus on to\r\nAthens,\" as Aristophanes the comic poet said, as make the city dependent\r\nupon Peiraeus, and the land dependent on the sea. By this means he\r\ntransferred power from the nobles to the people, because sailors and\r\npilots became the real strength of the State. For this reason the thirty\r\ntyrants destroyed the bema, or tribune on the place of public assembly,\r\nwhich was built looking towards the sea, and built another which looked\r\ninland, because they thought that the naval supremacy of Athens had been\r\nthe origin of its democratic constitution, and that an oligarchy had\r\nless to fear from men who cultivated the land.\r\n\r\nXX. Themistokles had even more extended views than these about making\r\nthe Athenians supreme at sea. When Xerxes was gone, the whole Greek\r\nfleet was drawn up on shore for the winter at Pagasae. Themistokles then\r\npublicly told the Athenians that he had a plan which would save and\r\nbenefit them all, but which must not be divulged. The Athenians bade him\r\ntell Aristeides only, and to execute his designs if he approved.\r\n\r\nThemistokles then told Aristeides that his design was to burn the whole\r\nGreek fleet as they lay on the beach. But Aristeides came forward and\r\ntold the people that no proposal could be more advantageous or more\r\nvillainous; so that the Athenians forbade Themistokles to proceed with\r\nit. On another occasion the Lacedaemonians proposed, in a meeting of the\r\nAmphiktyonic council, that all States that had taken no part in the\r\nPersian war should be excluded from that council; Themistokles, fearing\r\nthat if the Lacedaemonians should exclude Thessaly, Argos, and Thebes,\r\nthey would have complete control over the votes, and be able to carry\r\nwhat measures they pleased, made representations to the various States,\r\nand influenced the votes of their deputies at the meeting, pointing out\r\nto them that there were only thirty-one States which took any part in\r\nthe war, and that most of these were very small ones, so that it would\r\nbe unreasonable for one or two powerful States to pronounce the rest of\r\nGreece outlawed, and be supreme in the council. After this he generally\r\nopposed the Lacedaemonians; wherefore they paid special court to Kimon,\r\nin order to establish him as a political rival to Themistokles.\r\n\r\nXXI. Moreover, he made himself odious to the allies by sailing about the\r\nislands and wringing money from them. A case in point is the\r\nconversation which Herodotus tells us he held with the people of Andros,\r\nwhen trying to get money from them. He said that he was come, bringing\r\nwith him two gods, Persuasion and Necessity; but they replied that they\r\nalso possessed two equally powerful ones, Poverty and Helplessness, by\r\nwhom they were prevented from supplying him with money. The poet,\r\nTimokreon of Rhodes, in one of his songs, writes bitterly of\r\nThemistokles, saying that he was prevailed upon by the bribes which he\r\nreceived from exiles to restore them to their native country, but\r\nabandoned himself, who was his guest and friend. The song runs as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    \"Though ye may sing Pausanias or Xanthippus in your lays,\r\n    Or Leotychides, 'tis Aristeides whom I praise,\r\n    The best of men as yet produced by holy Athens' State,\r\n    Since thus upon Themistokles has fall'n Latona's hate:\r\n    That liar and that traitor base, who for a bribe unclean,\r\n    Refused to reinstate a man who his own guest had been.\r\n    His friend too, in his native Ialysus, but who took\r\n    Three silver talents with him, and his friend forsook.\r\n    Bad luck go with the fellow, who unjustly some restores\r\n    From exile, while some others he had banished from our shores,\r\n    And some he puts to death; and sits among us gorged with pelf.\r\n    He kept an ample table at the Isthmian games himself,\r\n    And gave to every guest that came full plenty of cold meat,\r\n    The which they with a prayer did each and every of them eat,\r\n    But their prayer was 'Next year be there no Themistokles to meet.'\"\r\n\r\nAnd after the exile and condemnation of Themistokles, Timokreon wrote\r\nmuch more abusively about him in a song which begins,\r\n\r\n    \"Muse, far away,\r\n    Sound this my lay,\r\n    For it both meet and right is.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said that Timokreon was exiled from home for having dealings with\r\nthe Persians, and that Themistokles confirmed his sentence. When, then,\r\nThemistokles was charged with intriguing with the Persians, Timokreon\r\nwrote upon him,\r\n\r\n    \"Timokreon is not the only Greek\r\n    That turned a traitor, Persian gold to seek;\r\n    I'm not the only fox without a tail,\r\n    But others put their honour up for sale.\"\r\n\r\nXXII. As the Athenians, through his unpopularity, eagerly listened to\r\nany story to his discredit, he was obliged to weary them by constantly\r\nrepeating the tale of his own exploits to them. In answer to those who\r\nwere angry with him, he would ask, \"Are you weary of always receiving\r\nbenefits from the same hand?\" He also vexed the people by building the\r\nTemple of Artemis of Good Counsel, as he called her, hinting that he had\r\ntaken good counsel for the Greeks. This temple he placed close to his\r\nown house in Melite, at the place where at the present day the public\r\nexecutioner casts out the bodies of executed criminals, and the clothes\r\nand ropes of men who have hanged themselves. Even in our own times a\r\nsmall statue of Themistokles used to stand in the Temple of Artemis of\r\nGood Counsel; and he seems to have been a hero not only in mind, but in\r\nappearance. The Athenians made use of ostracism to banish him, in order\r\nto reduce his extravagant pretensions, as they always were wont to do in\r\nthe case of men whom they thought over powerful and unfit for living in\r\nthe equality of a democracy. For ostracism implied no censure, but was\r\nintended as a vent for envious feelings, which were satisfied by seeing\r\nthe object of their hatred thus humbled.\r\n\r\nXXIII. When Themistokles was banished from Athens, he lived in Argos,\r\nduring which time the proceedings of Pausanias gave a great opportunity\r\nto his enemies. He was impeached on a charge of treason by Leobotes, the\r\nson of Alkmaeon of Agraulai, and the Spartans joined in the impeachment.\r\nPausanias, indeed, at first concealed his treacherous designs from\r\nThemistokles, although he was his friend; but when he saw that\r\nThemistokles was banished, and chafing at the treatment he had received,\r\nhe was encouraged to ask him to share his treason, and showed him the\r\nletters which he had received from the Persian king, at the same time\r\ninflaming his resentment against the Greeks, whom he spoke of as\r\nungrateful wretches. Themistokles refused utterly to join Pausanias, but\r\nnevertheless told no one of his treasonable practices, either because he\r\nhoped that he would desist, or that his visionary and impossible\r\nprojects would be disclosed by other means. And thus it was that when\r\nPausanias was put to death, certain letters and writings on this subject\r\nwere found, which threw suspicion upon Themistokles. The Lacedaemonians\r\nloudly condemned him, and many of his own countrymen, because of the\r\nenmity they bore him, brought charges against him. He did not appear in\r\nperson at first, but answered these attacks by letters. In these he told\r\nhis accusers that he had always sought to rule, and was not born to\r\nobey; so that he never would sell himself and Greece to be a slave to\r\nthe Persians. But in spite of these arguments, his enemies prevailed\r\nupon the Athenians to send men with orders to seize him, and bring him\r\nto be tried by Greece.\r\n\r\nXXIV. He was apprised of this in time to take refuge in Korkyra, a State\r\nwhich was under obligations to him. For once, when Korkyra was at\r\nvariance with Corinth, he had been chosen to arbitrate between them, and\r\nhad reconciled them, giving as his award that the Corinthians were to\r\npay down twenty talents, and each State to have an equal share in the\r\ncity and island of Leucas, as being a colony from both of them. From\r\nthence he fled to Epirus; but, being still pursued by the Athenians and\r\nLacedaemonians, he adopted a desperate resolution. Admetus, the king of\r\nthe Molossians, had once made some request to the Athenians, which\r\nThemistokles, who was then in the height of his power, insultingly\r\nrefused to grant. Admetus was deeply incensed, and eager for vengeance;\r\nbut now Themistokles feared the fresh fury of his countrymen more than\r\nthis old grudge of the king's, put himself at his mercy, and became a\r\nsuppliant to Admetus in a novel and strange fashion; for he lay down at\r\nthe hearth of Admetus, holding that prince's infant son, which is\r\nconsidered among the Molossians to be the most solemn manner of becoming\r\na suppliant, and one which cannot be refused. Some say that Phthia, the\r\nking's wife, suggested this posture to Themistokles, and placed her\r\ninfant on the hearth with him; while others say that Admetus, in order\r\nto be able to allege religious reasons for his refusal to give up\r\nThemistokles to his pursuers, himself arranged the scene with him. After\r\nthis, Epikrates, of the township of Acharnai, managed to convey his wife\r\nand children out of Athens to join him, for which, we are told by\r\nStesimbrotus, Kimon subsequently had him condemned and executed. But,\r\nsingularly enough, afterwards Stesimbrotus either forgets his wife and\r\nchildren, or makes Themistokles forget them, when he says that he sailed\r\nto Sicily and demanded the daughter of the despot Hiero in marriage,\r\npromising that he would make all Greece obey him. As Hiero rejected his\r\nproposals, he then went to Asia.\r\n\r\nXXV. Now it is not probable that this ever took place. Theophrastus, in\r\nhis treatise on monarchy, relates that when Hiero sent race-horses to\r\nOlympia and pitched a costly tent there, Themistokles said to the\r\nassembled Greeks that they ought to destroy the despot's tent, and not\r\npermit his horses to run. Thucydides too informs us that he crossed to\r\nthe Aegean sea, and set sail from Pydna, none of his fellow-travellers\r\nknowing who he was until the ship was driven by contrary winds to Naxos,\r\nwhich was then being besieged by the Athenians. Then he became alarmed,\r\nand told the captain and the pilot who he was, and, partly by\r\nentreaties, partly by threats that he would denounce them to the\r\nAthenians, and say that they well knew who he was, but were carrying him\r\nout of the country for a bribe, he prevailed on them to hold on their\r\ncourse to the coast of Asia.\r\n\r\nOf his property, much was concealed by his friends and sent over to him\r\nin Asia; but what was confiscated to the public treasury amounted,\r\naccording to Theopompus, to a hundred talents, and according to\r\nTheophrastus to eighty, albeit Themistokles, before his entrance into\r\npolitical life, did not possess property worth three talents.\r\n\r\nXXVI. When he sailed to Kyme, he found that many of the inhabitants of\r\nthe Ionic coast were watching for an opportunity to capture him,\r\nespecially Ergoteles and Pythodorus (for indeed, to men who cared not\r\nhow they made their money, he would have been a rich prize, as the\r\nPersian king had offered a reward of two hundred talents for him), he\r\nfled to Aegae, a little Aeolian city, where he was known by no one\r\nexcept his friend Nikogenes, the richest of all the Aeolians, who was\r\nwell known to the Persians of the interior. In this man's house he lay\r\nconcealed for some days. Here, after the feast which followed a\r\nsacrifice, Olbius, who took charge of Nikogenes's children, fell into a\r\nkind of inspired frenzy, and spoke the following verse:\r\n\r\n\"Night shall speak and give thee counsel, night shall give thee\r\nvictory.\" After this Themistokles dreamed a dream. He thought that a\r\nsnake was coiling itself upon his belly and crawling up towards his\r\nthroat. As soon as it reached his throat, it became an eagle and flapped\r\nits wings, lifted him up, and carried him a long distance, until he saw\r\na golden herald's staff. The eagle set him down upon this securely, and\r\nhe felt free from all terror and anxiety. After this he was sent away by\r\nNikogenes, who made use of the following device. Most barbarian nations,\r\nand the Persians especially, are violently jealous in their treatment of\r\nwomen. They guard not only their wives, but their purchased slaves and\r\nconcubines, with the greatest care, not permitting them to be seen by\r\nany one out of doors, but when they are at home they lock them up, and\r\nwhen they are on a journey they place them in waggons with curtains all\r\nround them. Such a waggon was prepared for Themistokles, and he\r\ntravelled in it, his escort telling all whom they met that they were\r\nconveying a Greek lady from Ionia to one of the king's courtiers.\r\n\r\nXXVII. Thucydides and Charon of Lampsakus relate that Xerxes was now\r\ndead, and that Themistokles gave himself up to his son; but Ephorus,\r\nDeinon, Kleitarchus, Herakleides, and many others, say that it was to\r\nXerxes himself that he came. But the narrative of Thucydides agrees\r\nbetter with the dates, although they are not thoroughly settled.\r\n\r\nAt this perilous crisis Themistokles first applied to Artabanus, a\r\nchiliarch, or officer in command of a regiment of a thousand men, whom\r\nhe told that he was a Greek, and that he wished to have an interview\r\nwith the king about matters of the utmost importance, and in which the\r\nking was especially interested. He replied, \"Stranger, the customs of\r\ndifferent races are different, and each has its own standard of right\r\nand wrong; yet among all men it is thought right to honour, admire, and\r\nto defend one's own customs. Now we are told that you chiefly prize\r\nfreedom and equality; we on the other hand think it the best of all our\r\nlaws to honour the king, and to worship him as we should worship the\r\nstatue of a god that preserves us all. Wherefore if you are come with\r\nthe intention of adopting our customs, and of prostrating yourself\r\nbefore the king, you may be permitted to see the king, and speak with\r\nhim; but if not, you must use some other person to communicate with him;\r\nfor it is not the custom for the king to converse with any one who does\r\nnot prostrate himself before him.\" Themistokles, hearing this, said to\r\nhim, \"Artabanus, I am come to increase the glory and power of the king,\r\nand will both myself adopt your customs, since the god that has exalted\r\nthe Persians will have it so, and will also increase the number of those\r\nwho prostrate themselves before the king. So let this be no impediment\r\nto the interview with him which I desire.\" \"Whom of the Greeks,\" asked\r\nArtabanus, \"are we to tell him is come? for you do not seem to have the\r\nmanners of a man of humble station.\" \"No one,\" answered Themistokles,\r\n\"must learn my name before the king himself.\" This is the story which we\r\nare told by Phanias. But Eratosthenes, in his treatise on wealth, tells\r\nus also that Themistokles was introduced to Artabanus by an Eretrian\r\nlady with whom the latter lived.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. When he was brought into the king's presence he prostrated\r\nhimself, and stood silent. The king then told his interpreter to ask him\r\nwho he was; and when the interpreter had asked this question, he told\r\nhim to answer, \"I am, O King, Themistokles the Athenian, an exile, a man\r\nwho has wrought much evil to the Persians, but more good than evil, in\r\nthat I stopped the pursuit when Greece was safe, and I was able to do\r\nyou a kindness as all was well at home. In my present fallen fortunes I\r\nam prepared to be grateful for any mark of favour you may show me, or to\r\ndeprecate your anger, should you bear a grudge against me. You may see,\r\nfrom the violence of my own countrymen against me, how great were the\r\nbenefits which I conferred upon the Persians; so now use me rather as a\r\nmeans of proving your magnanimity than of glutting your wrath. Wherefore\r\nsave me, your suppliant, and do not destroy one who has become the enemy\r\nof Greece.\" Themistokles also introduced a supernatural element into his\r\nspeech by relating the vision which he saw at the house of Nikogenes,\r\nand also a prophecy which he received at the shrine of Jupiter of\r\nDodona, which bade him \"go to the namesake of the god,\" from which he\r\nconcluded that the god sent him to the king, because they were both\r\ngreat, and called kings. To this speech the Persian king made no answer,\r\nalthough he was astonished at his bold spirit; but in conversation with\r\nhis friends he spoke as though this were the greatest possible piece of\r\ngood fortune, and in his prayers begged Arimanios to make his enemies\r\never continue to banish their ablest men. He is said to have offered a\r\nsacrifice to the gods and to have drunk wine at once, and during the\r\nnight in his soundest sleep he thrice cried out, \"I have got\r\nThemistokles the Athenian.\"\r\n\r\nXXIX. At daybreak he called together his friends and sent for\r\nThemistokles, who augured nothing pleasant from the insults and abuse\r\nwhich he received from the people at the palace gates, when they heard\r\nhis name. Moreover Roxanes the chiliarch, as Themistokles passed by him\r\nin silence into the king's presence, whispered, \"Thou subtle serpent of\r\nGreece, the king's good genius has led thee hither.\" But when he was\r\ncome before the king and had prostrated himself a second time, the king\r\nembraced him, and said in a friendly tone that he already owed him two\r\nhundred talents: for as he had brought himself he was clearly entitled\r\nto the reward which was offered to any one else who would do so. He also\r\npromised him much more than this, and encouraged him to speak at length\r\nupon the affairs of Greece. To this Themistokles answered, that human\r\nspeech was like embroidered tapestry, because when spread out it shows\r\nall its figures, but when wrapped up it both conceals and spoils them,\r\nwherefore he asked for time. The king was pleased with his simile, and\r\nbade him take what time he chose. He asked for a year, during which he\r\nlearned the Persian language sufficiently to talk to the king without an\r\ninterpreter. This led the people to imagine that he discoursed about the\r\naffairs of Greece; but many changes were made at that time in the great\r\nofficers of the court, and the nobles disliked Themistokles, imagining\r\nthat he dared to speak about them to the king. Indeed, he was honoured\r\nas no other foreigner ever was, and went hunting with the king and lived\r\nin his family circle, so that he came into the presence of the king's\r\nmother, and became her intimate friend, and at the king's command was\r\ninstructed in the mysteries of the Magi.\r\n\r\nWhen Demaratus the Spartan was bidden to ask for a boon, he asked to be\r\nallowed to drive through Sardis wearing his tiara upright like that of\r\nthe king. Mithropaustes, the king's cousin, took hold of Demaratus by\r\nhis tiara, saying, \"You have no brains for the king's tiara to cover;\r\ndo you think you would become Zeus if you were given his thunderbolt to\r\nwield?\" The king was very angry with Demaratus because of this request,\r\nbut Themistokles by his entreaties restored him to favour. It is also\r\nsaid that the later Persian kings, whose politics were more mixed up\r\nwith those of Greece, used to promise any Greek whom they wished to\r\ndesert to them that they would treat him better than Themistokles. We\r\nare told that Themistokles himself, after he became a great man and was\r\ncourted by many, was seated one day at a magnificent banquet, and said\r\nto his children, \"My sons, we should have been ruined if it had not been\r\nfor our ruin.\" Most writers agree that three cities, Magnesia,\r\nLampsakus, and Myous, were allotted to him for bread, wine, and meat. To\r\nthese Neanthes of Kyzikus and Phanias add two more, Perkote and\r\nPalaiskepsis, which were to supply bedding and clothing respectively.\r\n\r\nXXX. On one occasion, when he went down to the seaside on some business\r\nconnected with Greece, a Persian named Epixyes, Satrap of Upper Phrygia,\r\nplotted his assassination. He had long kept some Pisidians who were to\r\nkill him when he passed the night in the town of Leontokophalos, which\r\nmeans 'Lion's Head.' It is said that the mother of the gods appeared to\r\nhim while he was sleeping at noon and said, \"Themistokles, be late at\r\nLion's Head, lest you fall in with a lion. As a recompense for this\r\nwarning, I demand Mnesiptolema for my handmaid.\" Themistokles, disturbed\r\nat this, after praying to the goddess, left the highway and made a\r\ncircuit by another road, avoiding that place; when it was night he\r\nencamped in the open country. As one of the sumpter cattle that carried\r\nhis tent had fallen into a river, Themistokles's servants hung up the\r\nrich hangings, which were dripping with wet, in order to dry them. The\r\nPisidians meanwhile came up to the camp with drawn swords, and, not\r\nclearly distinguishing in the moonlight the things hung out to dry,\r\nthought that they must be the tent of Themistokles, and that they would\r\nfind him asleep within it. When they came close to it and raised the\r\nhangings, the servants who were on the watch fell upon them and seized\r\nthem. Having thus escaped from danger, he built a temple to Dindymene at\r\nMagnesia to commemorate the appearance of the goddess, and appointed\r\nhis daughter Mnesiptolema to be its priestess.\r\n\r\nXXXI. When he came to Sardis, he leisurely examined the temples and the\r\nofferings which they contained, and in the temple of the mother of the\r\ngods, he found a bronze female figure called the Water-carrier, about\r\ntwo cubits high, which he himself, when overseer of the water supply of\r\nAthens, had made out of the fines imposed upon those who took water\r\nillegally.\r\n\r\nEither feeling touched at the statue being a captive, or else willing to\r\nshow the Athenians how much power he possessed in Persia, he proposed to\r\nthe Satrap of Lydia to send it back to Athens. This man became angry at\r\nhis demand, and said that he should write to the king, and tell him of\r\nit. Themistokles in terror applied himself to the harem of the Satrap,\r\nand by bribing the ladies there induced them to pacify him, while he\r\nhimself took care to be more cautious in future, as he saw that he had\r\nto fear the enmity of the native Persians. For this reason, Theopompus\r\ntells us, he ceased to wander about Asia, but resided at Magnesia,\r\nwhere, receiving rich presents and honoured equally with the greatest\r\nPersian nobles, he lived for a long time in tranquillity; for the king's\r\nattention was so entirely directed to the affairs of the provinces of\r\nthe interior that he had no leisure for operations against Greece. But\r\nwhen Egypt revolted, and the Athenians assisted it, and Greek triremes\r\nsailed as far as Cyprus and Cilicia, and Kimon was master of the sea,\r\nthen the king determined to attack the Greeks, and prevent their\r\ndevelopment at his expense. Armies were put in motion, generals were\r\nappointed, and frequent messages were sent to Themistokles from the\r\nking, bidding him attack Greece and fulfil his promises. Themistokles,\r\nunmoved by resentment against his countrymen, and uninfluenced by the\r\nthought of the splendid position which he might occupy as\r\ncommander-in-chief, possibly too, thinking that his task was an\r\nimpossible one, as Greece possessed many great generals, especially\r\nKimon, who had a most brilliant reputation, but chiefly because he would\r\nnot soil his glory and disgrace the trophies which he had won,\r\ndetermined, as indeed was his best course, to bring his life to a\r\nfitting close. He offered sacrifice to the gods, called his friends\r\ntogether, and, having taken leave of them, drank bull's blood, according\r\nto the most common tradition, but according to others, some\r\nquickly-operating poison, and died at Magnesia in the sixty-fifth year\r\nof a life almost entirely spent in great political and military\r\nemployments.\r\n\r\nThe King of Persia, when he heard of the manner of his death and his\r\nreasons for dying, admired him more than ever, and continued to treat\r\nhis family and friends with kindness.\r\n\r\nXXXII. Themistokles left five children, Neokles, Diokles, Archeptolis,\r\nPolyeuktus, Kleophantus, by his first wife Archippe, who was the\r\ndaughter of Lysander, of the township of Alopekai. Of these Kleophantus\r\nis mentioned by Plato the philosopher as being an excellent horseman,\r\nbut otherwise worthless. Of the elder ones, Neokles was bitten by a\r\nhorse and died while still a child, and Diokles was adopted by his\r\ngrandfather Lysander. He also had several daughters by his second wife,\r\nof whom Mnesiptolema married Archeptolis, her father's half-brother;\r\nItalia married Panthoides of the island of Chios, and Sybaris married\r\nNikomedes, an Athenian. After Themistokles's death, his nephew\r\nPhrasikles sailed to Magnesia, and with her brother's consent married\r\nNicomache, and also took charge of the youngest child, who was named\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\nThe people of Magnesia show a splendid tomb of Themistokles in their\r\nmarket-place; but with regard to the fate of his remains we must pay no\r\nattention to Andokides, who in his address to his friends, tells us that\r\nthe Athenians stole them and tore them to pieces, because he would tell\r\nany falsehood to excite the hatred of the nobles against the people.\r\nPhylarchus, too, writes his history in such dramatic form that he all\r\nbut resorts to the actual machinery of the stage, bringing forward one\r\nNeokles, and Demopolis as the children of Themistokles to make a\r\ntouching scene, which anyone can see is untrue. Diodorus the\r\ntopographer, in his treatise 'On Tombs' says, more as a conjecture than\r\nas knowing it for a fact, that in the great harbour of Peiraeus a kind\r\nof elbow juts out from the promontory of Alkimus, and that when one\r\nsails past this, going inwards, where the sea is most sheltered, there\r\nis a large foundation, and upon it the tomb of Themistokles, shaped like\r\nan altar. It is thought that the comic poet Plato alludes to this in the\r\nfollowing verses:\r\n\r\n    \"By the sea's margin, by the watery strand,\r\n    Thy monument, Themistokles, shall stand;\r\n    By this directed to thy native shore\r\n    The merchant shall convey his freighted store;\r\n    And when our fleets are summoned to the fight,\r\n    Athens shall conquer with thy tomb in sight.\"\r\n\r\nThe descendants of Themistokles are given certain privileges at Magnesia\r\neven to the present day, for I know that Themistokles, an Athenian, my\r\nfriend and fellow-student in the school of Ammonias the philosopher,\r\nenjoyed them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF CAMILLUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The strangest fact in the life of Furius Camillus is that, although\r\nhe was a most successful general and won great victories, though he was\r\nfive times appointed dictator, triumphed four times, and was called the\r\nsecond founder of Rome, yet he never once was consul. The reason of this\r\nis to be found in the political condition of Rome at that time; for the\r\npeople, being at variance with the senate, refused to elect consuls, and\r\nchose military tribunes instead, who, although they had full consular\r\npowers, yet on account of their number were less offensive to the people\r\nthan consuls. To have affairs managed by six men instead of two appears\r\nto have been a consolation to those who had suffered from the arbitrary\r\nrule of a few. It was during this period that Camillus reached the\r\nheight of power and glory, and yet he would not become consul against\r\nthe will of the people, although several occasions occurred when he\r\nmight have been elected, but in his various appointments he always\r\ncontrived, even when he had sole command, to share his power with\r\nothers, while even when he had colleagues he kept all the glory for\r\nhimself. His moderation prevented any one from grudging him power, while\r\nhis successes were due to his genius, in which he confessedly surpassed\r\nall his countrymen.\r\n\r\nII. The family of the Furii was not a very illustrious one before\r\nCamillus gained glory in the great battle with the Aequi and Volsci,\r\nwhere he served under the dictator Postumius Tubertus. Riding out before\r\nthe rest of the army, he was struck in the thigh by a dart, but tore it\r\nout, assailed the bravest of the enemy, and put them to flight. After\r\nthis, amongst other honours he was appointed censor, an office of great\r\ndignity at that time. One admirable measure is recorded of his\r\ncensorship, that by arguments and threatening them with fines he\r\npersuaded the unmarried citizens to marry the widow women, whose number\r\nwas very great on account of the wars. Another measure to which he was\r\nforced was that of taxing orphans, who had hitherto been exempt from\r\ntaxation. This was rendered necessary by the constant campaigns which\r\nwere carried on at a great expense, and more especially by the siege of\r\nVeii. Some call the inhabitants of this city Veientani. It was the\r\nbulwark of Etruria, possessing as many fighting men as Rome itself; the\r\ncitizens were rich, luxurious, and extravagant in their habits, and\r\nfought bravely many times for honour and for power against the Romans.\r\nAt this period, having been defeated in several great battles, the\r\npeople of Veii had given up any schemes of conquest, but had built\r\nstrong and high walls, filled their city with arms and provisions, and\r\nall kinds of material of war, and fearlessly endured a siege, which was\r\nlong, no doubt, but which became no less irksome and difficult to the\r\nbesiegers. Accustomed as the Romans had been to make short campaigns in\r\nsummer weather, and to spend their winters at home, they were now for\r\nthe first time compelled by their tribunes to establish forts and\r\nentrench their camp, and pass both summer and winter in the enemy's\r\ncountry for seven years in succession. The generals were complained of,\r\nand as they seemed to be carrying on the siege remissly, they were\r\nremoved, and others appointed, among them Camillus, who was then tribune\r\nfor the second time. But he effected nothing in the siege at that time,\r\nbecause he was sent to fight the Faliscans and Capenates, who had\r\ninsulted the Roman territory throughout the war with Veii, when the\r\nRoman army was engaged elsewhere, but were now driven by Camillus with\r\ngreat loss to the shelter of their city walls.\r\n\r\nIII. After this, while the war was at its height, much alarm was caused\r\nby the strange phenomenon seen at the Alban lake, which could not be\r\naccounted for on ordinary physical principles. The season was autumn,\r\nand the summer had not been remarkable for rain or for moist winds, so\r\nthat many of the streams and marshes in Italy were quite dried up, and\r\nothers held out with difficulty, while the rivers, as is usual in\r\nsummer, were very low and deeply sunk in their bed. But the Alban lake,\r\nwhich is self-contained, lying as it does surrounded by fertile hills,\r\nbegan for no reason, except it may be the will of Heaven, to increase in\r\nvolume and to encroach upon the hillsides near it, until it reached\r\ntheir very tops, rising quietly and without disturbance. At first the\r\nportent only amazed the shepherds and herdsmen of the neighbourhood; but\r\nwhen the lake by the weight of its waters broke through the thin isthmus\r\nof land which restrained it, and poured down in a mighty stream through\r\nthe fertile plains below to the sea, then not only the Romans, but all\r\nthe people of Italy, thought it a portent of the gravest character. Much\r\ntalk about it took place in the camp before Veii, so that the besieged\r\nalso learned what was happening at the lake.\r\n\r\nIV. As always happens during a long siege, where there are frequent\r\nopportunities of intercourse between the two parties, one of the Romans\r\nhad become intimate with a citizen of Veii, who was learned in legendary\r\nlore, and was even thought to have supernatural sources of information.\r\nWhen this man heard of the overflowing of the lake, his Roman friend\r\nobserved that he was overjoyed, and laughed at the idea of the siege\r\nbeing successful. The Roman told him that these were not the only\r\nportents which troubled the Romans at the present time, but that there\r\nwere others stranger than this, about which he should like to consult\r\nhim, and, if possible, save himself in the common ruin of his country.\r\nThe man eagerly attended to his discourse, imagining that he was about\r\nto hear some great secrets. The Roman thus decoyed him away farther and\r\nfarther from the city gate, when he suddenly seized him and lifted him\r\nfrom the ground. Being the stronger man, and being assisted by several\r\nsoldiers from the camp, he overpowered him, and brought him before the\r\ngenerals. Here the man, seeing that there was no escape, and that no one\r\ncan resist his destiny, told them of the ancient oracles about his city,\r\nhow it could not be taken until its enemies drove back the waters of the\r\nAlban lake, and prevented its joining the sea. When the senate heard\r\nthis they were at a loss what to do, and determined to send an embassy\r\nto Delphi to enquire of the God. The embassy consisted of men of mark\r\nand importance, being Licinius Cossus, Valerius Potitus, and Fabius\r\nAmbustus. After a prosperous journey they returned with a response from\r\nApollo, pointing out certain ceremonies which had been neglected in the\r\nfeast of the Latin games, and bidding them, if possible, force the\r\nwaters of the Alban lake away from the sea into its ancient course, or,\r\nif this could not be done, to divide the stream by canals and\r\nwatercourses, and so to expend it in the plain. When the answer was\r\nbrought back, the priests took the necessary steps about the sacrifices,\r\nwhile the people turned their attention to the diversion of the water.\r\n\r\nV. In the tenth year of the war, the Senate recalled all the rest of the\r\ngenerals, and made Camillus Dictator. He chose Cornelius Scipio to be\r\nhis Master of the Knights, and made a vow to the gods, that, if he\r\nsucceeded in bringing the war to a glorious close, he would celebrate a\r\ngreat festival, and build a shrine to the goddess whom the Romans call\r\n_Mater Matuta_. This goddess, from the rites with which she is\r\nworshipped, one would imagine to be the same as the Greek Leukothea. For\r\nthey bring a slave girl into the temple and beat her, and then drive her\r\nout; they take their brothers' children in their arms in preference to\r\ntheir own, and generally their ceremonies seem to allude to the nursing\r\nof Bacchus, and to the misfortunes which befell Ino because of her\r\nhusband's concubine. After this, Camillus invaded the Faliscan\r\nterritory, and in a great battle overthrew that people, and the\r\nCapenates who came to their assistance. Next, he turned his attention to\r\nthe siege of Veii, and, perceiving that it would be a difficult matter\r\nto take the city by assault, he ordered mines to be dug, as the ground\r\nnear the walls was easily worked, and the mines could be sunk to a\r\nsufficient depth to escape the notice of the besieged. As this work\r\nsucceeded to his wish, he made a demonstration above ground to call the\r\nenemy to the walls and distract their attention, while others made their\r\nway unperceived through the mine to the Temple of Juno in the citadel,\r\nthe largest and most sacred edifice in the city. Here, it is said, was\r\nthe King of the Veientines, engaged in sacrificing. The soothsayer\r\ninspected the entrails, and cried with a loud voice, that the goddess\r\nwould give the victory to whoever offered that victim. The Romans in the\r\nmine, hearing these words, quickly tore up the floor, and burst through\r\nit with shouts and rattling arms. The enemy fled in terror, and they\r\nseized the victims and carried them to Camillus. However, this story\r\nsounds rather fabulous.\r\n\r\nThe city was stormed, and the Romans carried off an enormous mass of\r\nplunder. Camillus, who viewed them from the citadel, at first stood\r\nweeping, but when, congratulated by the bystanders, raised his hands to\r\nheaven and said, \"Great Jupiter, and all ye other gods, that see all\r\ngood and evil deeds alike, ye know that it is not in unrighteous\r\nconquest, but in self-defence, that the Romans have taken this city of\r\ntheir lawless enemies. If,\" he continued, \"there awaits us any reverse\r\nof fortune to counterbalance this good luck, I pray that it may fall,\r\nnot upon the city or army of Rome, but, as lightly as may be, upon my\r\nown head.\" After these words he turned round to the right, as is the\r\nRoman habit after prayer, and while turning, stumbled and fell. All\r\nthose present were terrified at the omen, but he recovered himself,\r\nsaying that, as he had prayed, he had received a slight hurt to temper\r\nhis great good fortune.\r\n\r\nVI. When the city was sacked, he determined to send the statue of Juno\r\nto Rome, according to his vow. When workmen were assembled for this\r\npurpose, he offered sacrifice, and prayed to the goddess to look kindly\r\non his efforts, and to graciously take up her abode among the gods of\r\nRome. It is said that the statue answered that it wished to do so, and\r\napproved of his proceedings. But Livy tells us that Camillus offered his\r\nprayers while touching the statue, and that some of the bystanders said,\r\n\"She consents, and is willing to come.\" However, those who insist on the\r\nsupernatural form of the story have one great argument in their favour,\r\nin the marvellous fortune of Rome, which never could from such small\r\nbeginnings have reached, such a pitch of glory and power without many\r\ndirect manifestations of the favour of Heaven. Moreover, other\r\nappearances of the same kind are to be compared with it, such as that\r\nstatues have often been known to sweat, have been heard to groan, and\r\nhave even turned away and shut their eyes, as has been related by many\r\nhistorians before our own time. And I have heard of many miraculous\r\noccurrences even at the present day, resting on evidence which cannot be\r\nlightly impugned. However, the weakness of human nature makes it equally\r\ndangerous to put too much faith in such matters or to entirely\r\ndisbelieve them, as the one leads to superstition and folly, and the\r\nother to neglect and contempt of the gods. Our best course is caution,\r\nand the \"golden mean.\"\r\n\r\nVII. Camillus, either because he was elated by the magnificence of his\r\nexploit in having taken a city as large as Rome after a ten years'\r\nsiege, or else because he had been so flattered by his admirers that his\r\npride overcame his sober judgment, conducted his triumph with great\r\nostentation, especially in driving through Rome in a chariot, drawn by\r\nfour white horses, which never was done by any general before or since,\r\nfor this carriage is thought to be sacred to Jupiter, the king and\r\nfather of the gods. The citizens, unaccustomed to splendour, were\r\ndispleased with him for this, and their dislike was increased by his\r\nopposition to the law for a redistribution of the people. The tribunes\r\nproposed that the Senate and people should be divided into two parts,\r\none of which should stay at Rome and the other remove to the captured\r\ncity, because they would be more powerful if they possessed two great\r\ncities, instead of one, and held the land in common, still remaining one\r\nnation. The lower classes, which were numerous and poor, eagerly took up\r\nthe scheme, and continually clamoured round the speakers at the rostra,\r\ndemanding to have it put to the vote. But the Senate and the nobles\r\nthought that it was not a redistribution, but the absolute destruction\r\nof Rome which the tribunes were demanding, and in their anger rallied\r\nround Camillus. He, fearing to have a contest on the matter, kept\r\nputting off the people and inventing reasons for delay, so as to prevent\r\nthe law being brought forward to be voted upon. This increased his\r\nunpopularity; but the greatest and most obvious reason for the dislike\r\nwhich the people bore him arose from his demand for the tenth part of\r\nthe spoils; very naturally, though perhaps he scarcely deserved it. On\r\nhis way to Veii it seems he had made a vow, that if he took the city he\r\nwould dedicate the tenth part of the spoil to Apollo. But when the city\r\nwas taken and plundered, he either was unwilling to interfere with his\r\ncountrymen, or else forgot his vow, and allowed them to enrich\r\nthemselves with the booty. Afterwards, when he had laid down his\r\ndictatorship, he brought the matter before the Senate, and the\r\nsoothsayers declared that the victims for sacrifice showed, when\r\ninspected, that the gods were angry and must be propitiated.\r\n\r\nVIII. The Senate decreed, not that the plunder should be given up, for\r\nthat would have been scarcely possible to carry out, but that those who\r\nhad taken any should be put on their oath, and contribute a tenth part\r\nof its value. This measure bore very hardly upon the soldiers, poor\r\nhard-working men, who were now compelled to repay so large a proportion\r\nof what they had earned and spent. Camillus was clamorously assailed by\r\nthem, and, having no better excuse to put forward, made the\r\nextraordinary statement that he had forgotten his vow when the city was\r\nplundered. The people angrily said that he had vowed to offer up a tithe\r\nof the enemy's property, but that he really was taking a tithe from the\r\ncitizens instead. However, all the contributions were made, and it was\r\ndetermined that with them a golden bowl should be made and sent to\r\nApollo at Delphi. There was a scarcity of gold in the city, and while\r\nthe government were deliberating how it was to be obtained, the matrons\r\nheld a meeting among themselves, and offered their golden ornaments to\r\nmake the offering, which came to eight talents' weight of gold. The\r\nSenate rewarded them by permitting them to have a funeral oration\r\npronounced over their graves the same as men; for hitherto it had not\r\nbeen customary at Rome to make any speeches at the funerals of women.\r\nThey also chose three of the noblest citizens to travel with the\r\noffering, and sent them in a well-manned ship of war, splendidly\r\nequipped. Both storms and calms at sea are said to be dangerous, and\r\nthey chanced on this occasion to come very near destruction, and\r\nmiraculously escaped, for in a calm off the Aeolian Islands they were\r\nassailed by Liparian triremes, who took them for pirates. At their\r\nearnest entreaty these people forbore to run down their vessel, but took\r\nit in tow and brought it into their harbour, where they treated it as a\r\npiratical craft, and put up the crew and the property on board for sale\r\nby public auction. With great difficulty, by the goodness and influence\r\nof one man, Timesitheos, a general, they obtained their release, and\r\nwere allowed to proceed. Timesitheos even launched some ships of his\r\nown, with which he escorted them to Delphi, where he also took part in\r\nthe ceremony of consecration. In return for his services, as was only\r\njust, he received special honours at Rome.\r\n\r\nIX. The tribunes of the people again began to agitate about the\r\nredistribution of land and occupation of Veii, but a war with the\r\nFaliscans gave the leading men a seasonable opportunity to elect\r\nmagistrates after their own hearts for the coming year. Camillus was\r\nappointed military tribune, with five others, as it was thought that the\r\nState required a general of tried experience. At the decree of the\r\nSenate, Camillus raised a force and invaded the Faliscan territory. He\r\nnow besieged Falerii, a strong city well provided with all munitions of\r\nwar, which he considered it would be a work of no small time and labour\r\nto take; but he was desirous of employing the people in a long siege, to\r\nprevent their having leisure for factious proceedings at home. This was\r\never the policy of the Romans, to work off the elements of internal\r\nstrife in attacks on their neighbours.\r\n\r\nX. The Faliscans thought so little of the siege, from the strength of\r\ntheir defences, that, except when on duty on the walls, they used to\r\nwalk about their city in their ordinary dress, and their children were\r\nsent regularly to school, and used to be taken by their master to walk\r\nand take exercise outside the walls. For the Faliscans, like the Greeks,\r\nhad one common school, as they wished all their children to be brought\r\nup together. The schoolmaster determined to betray these boys to the\r\nenemy, and led them outside the walls for exercise every day, and then\r\nled them back again. By this means he gradually accustomed them to going\r\nout as if there was no danger, until finally he took all the boys and\r\nhanded them over to the Roman pickets, bidding them bring him to\r\nCamillus. When he was brought before him he said that he was a\r\nschoolmaster, that he preferred the favour of Camillus to his duty, and\r\nthat he came to hand over to him the city of Falerii in the persons of\r\nthese boys.\r\n\r\nCamillus was very much shocked. He said that war is indeed harsh, and is\r\ncarried on by savage and unrighteous means, but yet there are laws of\r\nwar which are observed by good men, and one ought not so much to strive\r\nfor victory, as to forego advantages gained by wicked and villainous\r\nmeans: thus a truly great general ought to succeed by his own warlike\r\nvirtues, not by the baseness of others.\r\n\r\nHaving spoken thus, he ordered his slaves to tear the schoolmaster's\r\nclothes, tie his hands behind his back, and give the boys sticks and\r\nscourges with which to drive him back to the city. The Faliscans had\r\njust discovered the treachery of their schoolmaster, and, as may be\r\nexpected, the whole city was filled with mourning at such a calamity,\r\nmen and women together running in confusion to the gates and walls of\r\nthe city, when the boys drove in their schoolmaster with blows and\r\ninsults, calling Camillus their saviour, their father, and their god.\r\nNot only those who were parents, but all the citizens were struck with\r\nadmiration at the goodness of Camillus. They at once assembled, and\r\ndespatched ambassadors, putting themselves unreservedly in his hands.\r\nThese men Camillus sent on to Rome, where they stated before the Senate,\r\nthat the Romans, by preferring justice to conquest, had taught them to\r\nprefer submission to freedom, although they did not think that they fell\r\nshort of the Romans in strength so much as in virtue. The Senate\r\nreferred the ambassadors to Camillus for their first answer; and he,\r\nafter receiving a contribution in money, and having made a treaty of\r\nalliance with the Faliscans, drew off his forces.\r\n\r\nXI. But the soldiers, who had been looking forward to plundering\r\nFalerii, when they returned to Rome empty handed, abused Camillus to the\r\nother citizens, saying that he was a hater of the people, and grudged\r\npoor men a chance of enriching themselves. When the tribunes\r\nreintroduced the proposal of redistribution of the land, and removing\r\nhalf the city to Veii, Camillus openly, without caring how unpopular he\r\nbecame, opposed the measure. The people, sorely against their will, gave\r\nup the measure, but hated Camillus so fiercely that even his domestic\r\nafflictions (for he had just lost one of his two sons by sickness) could\r\nnot move them to pity. Being of a kind and loving nature, he was\r\ndreadfully cast down at this misfortune, and spent all his time within\r\ndoors mourning with the women of his family, while his enemies were\r\npreparing an impeachment against him.\r\n\r\nXII. His accuser was Lucius Apuleius, and the charge brought against him\r\nwas embezzlement of the spoils of Etruria. He was even said to have in\r\nhis possession some brazen gates which were taken in that country. The\r\npeople were much excited against him, and it was clear that, whatever\r\nthe charge against him might be, they would condemn him. Consequently he\r\nassembled his friends and comrades, who were a great number in all, and\r\nbegged them not to permit him to be ruined by false accusations, and\r\nmade a laughing-stock to his enemies. But when his friends, after\r\nconsulting together, answered that they did not think that they could\r\nprevent his being condemned, but that they would assist him to pay any\r\nfine that might be imposed, he, unable to bear such treatment,\r\ndetermined in a rage to leave Rome and go into exile. He embraced his\r\nwife and son, and walked from his house silently as far as the gate of\r\nthe city. There he turned back, and, stretching out his hands towards\r\nthe Capitol, prayed to the gods that, if he was driven out of Rome\r\nunjustly by the insolence and hatred of the people, the Romans might\r\nsoon repent of their conduct to him, and appear before the world begging\r\nhim to return, and longing for their Camillus back again.\r\n\r\nXIII. Like Achilles, he thus cursed his countrymen and left them. His\r\ncause was undefended, and in his absence he was condemned to pay a fine\r\nof fifteen thousand _ases_, which in Greek money is fifteen hundred\r\n_drachmas_, for the _as_ was the Roman coin at that time, and\r\nconsequently ten copper _ases_ were called a _denarius_.\r\n\r\nEvery Roman believes that the prayers of Camillus were quickly heard by\r\nJustice, and that a terrible retribution was exacted for his wrongs,\r\nwhich filled all men's mouths at that time; so terrible a fate befell\r\nRome, with such destruction, danger, and disgrace, whether it arose from\r\nmere chance, or whether it be the office of some god to punish those who\r\nrequite virtue with ingratitude.\r\n\r\nXIV. The first omen of impending evil was the death of Julius the\r\nCensor; for the Romans reverence the office of censor, and account it\r\nsacred. Another omen was that, a short time before Camillus went into\r\nexile, one Marcus Caedicius, a man of no particular note, and not even a\r\nsenator, but a thoroughly respectable man, communicated a matter of some\r\nimportance to the tribunes of the people. He said that the night before\r\nhe had been walking along what is called the New Road, when some one\r\ncalled him by name. He turned round and could see no one, but heard a\r\nvoice louder than man's say, \"Go, Marcus Caedicius, tell the government\r\nearly in the morning that in a short time they may expect the Gauls.\"\r\nWhen the tribunes of the people heard this they laughed him to scorn,\r\nand shortly afterwards Camillus left the city.\r\n\r\nXV. The Gauls are a people of the Celtic race, and are said to have\r\nbecome too numerous for their own country, and consequently to have left\r\nit to search for some other land to dwell in. As they consisted of a\r\nlarge multitude of young warriors, they started in two bodies, one of\r\nwhich, went towards the northern ocean, and, passing the Rhipaean\r\nmountains, settled in the most distant part of Europe. The other body\r\nestablished themselves between the Pyrenees and the Alps, and for a long\r\ntime dwelt near the Senones and Celtorii. At last they tasted wine,\r\nwhich was then for the first time brought thither out of Italy. In an\r\necstasy of delight at the drink they wildly snatched up their arms, took\r\ntheir families with them, and rushed to the Alps in search of the\r\ncountry which produced such fruits as this, considering all other\r\ncountries to be savage and uncultivated. The man who first introduced\r\nwine among them and encouraged them to proceed to Italy was said to be\r\none Aruns, an Etruscan of some note, who, though a well-meaning man, had\r\nmet with the following misfortune. He had been left guardian to an\r\norphan named Lucumo, one of the richest and handsomest of his\r\ncountrymen. This boy lived in the house of Aruns from his childhood, and\r\nwhen he grew up he would not leave it, but pretended to delight in his\r\nsociety. It was long before Aruns discovered that Lucumo had debauched\r\nhis wife, and that their passion was mutual; but at length they were\r\nunable any longer to conceal their intrigue, and the youth openly\r\nattempted to carry off the woman from her husband. He went to law, but\r\nwas unable to contend with the numerous friends and great wealth of\r\nLucumo, and so left the country. Hearing about the Gauls, he went to\r\nthem and incited them to invade Italy.\r\n\r\nXVI. They immediately made themselves masters of the country, which\r\nreaches from the Alps down to the sea on both sides of Italy, which in\r\nancient times belonged to the Etruscans, as we see by the names, for the\r\nupper sea is called the Adriatic from Adria, an Etruscan city, and the\r\nlower is called the Etruscan Sea. It is a thickly wooded country, with\r\nplenty of pasturage, and well watered. At that period it contained\r\neighteen fair and large cities, with a thriving commercial population.\r\nThe Gauls took these cities, drove out their inhabitants, and occupied\r\nthem themselves. This, however, took place some time previously to our\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nXVII. The Gauls at this time marched against the Etruscan city of\r\nClusium and besieged it. The inhabitants appealed to the Romans to send\r\nambassadors and letters to the barbarians, and they sent three of the\r\nFabian family, men of the first importance in Rome. They were well\r\nreceived, because of the name of Rome, by the Gauls, who desisted from\r\ntheir siege and held a conference with them. The Romans inquired what\r\nwrong the Gauls had suffered from the people of Clusium that they should\r\nattack their city. To this Brennus, the king of the Gauls, answered with\r\na laugh, \"The people of Clusium wrong us by holding a large territory,\r\nalthough they can only inhabit and cultivate a small one, while they\r\nwill not give a share of it to us, who are numerous and poor. You Romans\r\nwere wronged in just the same way in old times by the people of Alba,\r\nand Fidenae, and Ardea, and at the present day by the Veientines and\r\nCapenates, and by many of the Faliscans and Volscians. You make\r\ncampaigns against these people if they will not share their good things\r\nwith you, you sell them for slaves and plunder their territory, and\r\ndestroy their cities; and in this you do nothing wrong, but merely obey\r\nthe most ancient of all laws, that the property of the weak belongs to\r\nthe strong, a law which prevails among the gods on the one hand, and\r\neven among wild beasts, amongst whom the stronger always encroach upon\r\nthe weaker ones. So now cease to pity the besieged men of Clusium, for\r\nfear you should teach the Gauls to become good-natured and pitiful\r\ntowards the nations that have been wronged by the Romans.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech showed the Romans that Brennus had no thought of coming to\r\nterms, and they in consequence went into Clusium and encouraged the\r\ninhabitants to attack the barbarians under their guidance, either\r\nbecause they wished to make trial of the valour of the Gauls, or to make\r\na display of their own. The people of Clusium made a sally, and a battle\r\ntook place near their wall. In this one of the Fabii, Quintus Ambustus\r\nby name, was on horseback, and rode to attack a fine powerful Gaul who\r\nwas riding far in advance of the rest. At first the Roman was not\r\nrecognised because the fight was sharp, and the flashing of his arms\r\nprevented his face being clearly seen. But when he slew his antagonist\r\nand jumped down from his horse to strip his body of its spoils, Brennus\r\nrecognised him, and called the gods to witness his violation of the\r\ncommon law of all nations, in coming to them as an ambassador and\r\nfighting against them as an enemy. He immediately put a stop to the\r\nbattle and took no further heed of the people of Clusium, but directed\r\nhis army against Rome. However, as he did not wish it to be thought that\r\nthe bad conduct of the Romans pleased the Gauls, who only wanted a\r\npretext for hostilities, he sent and demanded that Fabius should be\r\ndelivered up to him to be punished, and at the same time led his army\r\nslowly forwards.\r\n\r\nXVIII. At Rome the Senate was called together, and many blamed Fabius,\r\nwhile those priests who are called Feciales urged the Senate in the\r\nname of religion to throw the whole blame of what had happened upon one\r\nguilty head, and, by delivering him up, to clear the rest of the city\r\nfrom sharing his guilt. These Feciales were instituted by the mildest\r\nand justest of the kings of Rome, Numa Pompilius, to be guardians of\r\npeace, and examiners of the reasons which justify a nation in going to\r\nwar. However the Senate referred the matter to the people, and when the\r\npriests repeated their charges against Fabius before them, the people so\r\ndespised and slighted religion as to appoint Fabius and his brothers\r\nmilitary tribunes. The Gauls, when they heard this, were enraged, and\r\nhurried on, disregarding everything but speed. The nations through which\r\nthey passed, terrified at their glancing arms and their strength and\r\ncourage, thought that their land was indeed lost and that their cities\r\nwould at once be taken, but to their wonder and delight the Gauls did\r\nthem no hurt, and took nothing from their fields, but marched close by\r\ntheir cities, calling out that they were marching against Rome, and were\r\nat war with the Romans only, and held all other men to be their friends.\r\nTo meet this impetuous rush, the military tribunes led out the Romans,\r\nwho, in numbers indeed were quite a match for the Gauls, for they\r\namounted to no less than forty thousand heavy-armed men, but for the\r\nmost part untrained and serving for the first time.\r\n\r\nBesides this disadvantage, they neglected the duties of religion, for\r\nthey neither made the usual sacrifices nor consulted the soothsayers.\r\nConfusion also was produced by the number of commanders, though\r\nfrequently before this, in much less important campaigns, they had\r\nchosen single generals, whom they called dictators, as they knew that\r\nnothing is so important at a dangerous crisis as that all should\r\nunanimously and in good order obey the commands of one irresponsible\r\nchief. And the unfair treatment which Camillus had received now bore\r\ndisastrous fruits, for no man dared to use authority except to flatter\r\nand gain the favour of the people.\r\n\r\nThey proceeded about eleven miles from the city, and halted for the\r\nnight on the banks of the river Allia, which joins the Tiber not far\r\nfrom where their camp was pitched. Here the barbarians appeared, and,\r\nafter an unskilfully managed battle, the want of discipline of the\r\nRomans caused their ruin. The Gauls drove the left wing into the river\r\nand destroyed it, but the right of the army, which took refuge in the\r\nhills to avoid the enemy's charge on level ground, suffered less, and\r\nmost of them reached the city safely. The rest, who survived after the\r\nenemy were weary of slaughter, took refuge at Veii, imagining that all\r\nwas over with Rome.\r\n\r\nXIX. This battle took place about the summer solstice at the time of\r\nfull moon, on the very day on which in former times the great disaster\r\nbefel the Fabii, when three hundred of that race were slain by the\r\nEtruscans. But this defeat wiped out the memory of the former one, and\r\nthe day was always afterwards called that of the Allia, from the river\r\nof that name.\r\n\r\nIt is a vexed question whether we ought to consider some days unlucky,\r\nor whether Herakleitus was right in rebuking Hesiod for calling some\r\ndays good and some bad, because he knew not that the nature of all days\r\nis the same. However the mention of a few remarkable instances is\r\ngermane to the matter of which we are treating. It happened that on the\r\nfifth day of the Boeotian month Hippodromios, which the Athenians call\r\nHekatombeion,[A] two signal victories were won by the Boeotians, both of\r\nwhich restored liberty to Greece; one, when they conquered the Spartans\r\nat Leuktra, and the other, when, more than two hundred years before\r\nthis, they conquered the Thessalians under Lattamyas at Kerêssus.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Plutarch himself was a Boeotian.]\r\n\r\nAgain, the Persians were beaten by the Greeks on the sixth of Boedromion\r\nat Marathon, and on the third they were beaten both at Plataea and at\r\nMykale, and at Arbela on the twenty-fifth of the same month. The\r\nAthenians too won their naval victory under Chabrias at Naxos on the\r\nfull moon of Boedromion, and that of Salamis on the twentieth of that\r\nmonth, as I have explained in my treatise 'On Days.'\r\n\r\nThe month of Thargelion evidently brings misfortune to the barbarians,\r\nfor Alexander defeated the Persian king's generals on the Granicus in\r\nThargelion, and the Carthaginians were defeated by Timoleon in Sicily\r\non the twenty-seventh of Thargelion, at which same time Troy is believed\r\nto have been taken, according to Ephorus, Kallisthenes, Damastes and\r\nPhylarchus.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the month Metageitnion, which the Boeotians call\r\nPanemos, is unfavourable to the Greeks, for on the seventh of that month\r\nthey were defeated by Antipater at Kranon and utterly ruined; and before\r\nthat, were defeated during that month by Philip at Chaeronea. And on\r\nthat same day and month and year Archidamus and his troops, who had\r\ncrossed over into Italy, were cut to pieces by the natives. The\r\ntwenty-first day of that month is also observed by the Carthaginians as\r\nthat which has always brought the heaviest misfortunes upon them. And I\r\nam well aware that at the time of the celebration of the mysteries\r\nThebes was destroyed for the second time by Alexander, and that after\r\nthis Athens was garrisoned by Macedonian soldiers on the twentieth of\r\nBoedromion, on which day they bring out the mystic Iacchus in\r\nprocession. And similarly the Romans, under the command of Caepio, on\r\nthat same day lost their camp to the Gauls, and afterwards, under\r\nLucullus, defeated Tigranes and the Armenians. King Attalus and Pompeius\r\nthe Great died on their own birthdays. And I could mention many others,\r\nwho have had both good and evil fortune on the same anniversaries. But\r\nthe Romans regard that day as especially unlucky, and on account of it,\r\ntwo other days in every month are thought so, as superstitious feeling\r\nis increased by misfortune. This subject I have treated at greater\r\nlength in my treatise on 'Roman Questions.'\r\n\r\nXX. If, after the battle, the Gauls had at once followed up the\r\nfugitives, nothing could have prevented their taking Rome and destroying\r\nevery one who was left in it; such terror did the beaten troops produce\r\nwhen they reached home, and such panic fear seized upon every one.\r\nHowever the barbarians scarcely believed in the completeness of their\r\nvictory, and betook themselves to making merry over their success and to\r\ndividing the spoils taken in the Roman camp, so that they afforded those\r\nwho left the city time to effect their escape, and those who remained in\r\nit time to recover their courage and make preparations for standing a\r\nsiege. They abandoned all but the Capitol to the enemy, and fortified it\r\nwith additional ramparts and stores of missiles. One of their first acts\r\nwas to convey most of their holy things into the Capitol, while the\r\nVestal virgins took the sacred fire and their other sacred objects and\r\nfled with them from the city. Some indeed say that nothing is entrusted\r\nto them except the eternal fire, which King Numa appointed to be\r\nworshiped as the origin of all things. For fire has the liveliest motion\r\nof anything in nature; and everything is produced by motion or with some\r\nkind of motion. All other parts of matter when heat is absent lie\r\nuseless and apparently dead, requiring the power of fire as the breath\r\nof life, to call them into existence and make them capable of action.\r\n\r\nNuma therefore, being a learned man and commonly supposed on account of\r\nhis wisdom to hold communion with the Muses, consecrated fire, and\r\nordered it to be kept unquenched for ever as an emblem of the eternal\r\npower that orders all things. Others say that, as among the Greeks, a\r\npurificatory fire burns before the temple, but that within are other\r\nholy things which no man may see, except only the virgins, who are named\r\nVestals; and a very wide-spread notion is, that the famous Trojan\r\nPalladium, which was brought to Italy by Aeneas, is kept there. Others\r\nsay that the Samothracian gods are there, whom Dardanus brought to Troy\r\nafter he had founded it, and caused to be worshipped there, which, after\r\nthe fall of Troy, Aeneas carried off and kept until he settled in Italy.\r\nBut those who pretend to know most about such matters say that there are\r\ntwo jars of no great size in the temple, one open and empty, and the\r\nother full and sealed, and that these may be seen only by the holy\r\nvirgins. Others think that this is a mistake, arising from the fact\r\nthat, at the time of which we are treating, the Vestal virgins placed\r\nmost of their sacred things in two jars and concealed them in the earth\r\nunder the Temple of Quirinus, which place even to the present day is\r\ncalled the _Doliola_, or place of the jars.\r\n\r\nXXI. However this may be, the Vestals took the most important of their\r\nholy things and betook themselves to flight along the Tiber. Here Lucius\r\nAlbinus, a plebian, was journeying among the fugitives, with his wife\r\nand infant children and their few necessaries in a waggon. When he saw\r\nthe Vestal virgins, without any attendants, journeying on foot and in\r\ndistress, carrying in their bosoms the sacred images of the gods, he at\r\nonce removed his wife, children, and property from the waggon and handed\r\nit over to them, to escape into one of the Greek cities in Italy. The\r\npiety of Albinus and his care for the duties of religion at so terrible\r\na crisis deserve to be recorded.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the priests and the old men who had been consuls, and been\r\nhonoured with triumphs, could not bear to leave the city. At the\r\ninstance of Fabius, the Pontifex Maximus, they put on their sacred\r\nvestments and robes of state, and after offering prayer to the gods, as\r\nif they were consecrating themselves as victims to be offered on behalf\r\nof their country, they sat down in their ivory chairs in the Forum in\r\nfull senatorial costume, and waited what fortune might befal them.\r\n\r\nXXII. On the third day after the battle Brennus appeared, leading his\r\narmy to attack the city. At first, seeing the gates open and no guards\r\non the walls, he feared some ambuscade, as he could not believe that the\r\nRomans had so utterly despaired of themselves. When he discovered the\r\ntruth, he marched through the Colline Gate, and captured Rome, a little\r\nmore than three hundred and sixty years after its foundation, if we can\r\nbelieve that any accurate record has been kept of those periods whose\r\nconfusion has produced such difficulties in the chronology of later\r\ntimes. However, an indistinct rumour of the fall of Rome seems at once\r\nto have reached Greece: for Herakleides of Pontus, who lived about that\r\ntime, speaks in his book 'On the Spirit,' of a rumour from the west that\r\nan army had come from the Hyperboreans and had sacked a Greek colony\r\ncalled Rome, which stood somewhere in that direction, near the great\r\nocean. Now, as Herakleides was fond of strange legends, I should not be\r\nsurprised if he adorned the original true tale of the capture of the\r\ncity with these accessories of \"the Hyperboreans\" and \"the great ocean.\"\r\nAristotle, the philosopher, had evidently heard quite accurately that\r\nthe city was taken by the Gauls, but he says that it was saved by one\r\nLucius: now Camillus's name was Marcus, not Lucius. All this, however,\r\nwas pure conjecture.\r\n\r\nBrennus, after taking possession of Rome, posted a force to watch the\r\nCapitol, and himself went down to the Forum, and wondered at the men who\r\nsat there silent, with all their ornaments, how they neither rose from\r\ntheir seats at the approach of the enemy, nor changed colour, but sat\r\nleaning on their staffs with fearless confidence, quietly looking at one\r\nanother. The Gauls were astonished at so strange a sight, and for a long\r\ntime they forbore to approach and touch them, as if they were superior\r\nbeings. But when one of them ventured to draw near to Marcus Papirius\r\nand gently stroke his long beard, Papirius struck him on the head with\r\nhis staff, at which the barbarian drew his sword and slew him. Upon this\r\nthey fell upon the rest and killed them, with any other Romans whom they\r\nfound, and spent many days in plundering the houses, after which they\r\nburned them and pulled them down in their rage at the men in the\r\nCapitol, because they would not surrender, but drove them back when they\r\nassaulted it. For this reason they wreaked their vengeance on the city,\r\nand put to death all their captives, men and women, old and young alike.\r\n\r\nXXIII. As the siege was a long one, the Gauls began to want for\r\nprovisions. They divided themselves into two bodies, one of which\r\nremained with the king and carried on the siege, while the others\r\nscoured the country, plundering and destroying the villages, not going\r\nall together in a body, but scattered in small detachments in various\r\ndirections, as their elation at their success caused them to have no\r\nfear about separating their forces. Their largest and best disciplined\r\nbody marched towards Ardea, where Camillus, since his banishment, had\r\nlived as a private person. All his thoughts, however, were bent not upon\r\navoiding or fleeing from the Gauls, but upon defeating them if possible.\r\nAnd so, seeing that the people of Ardea were sufficient in numbers, but\r\nwanting in confidence because of the want of experience and remissness\r\nof their leaders, he first began to tell the younger men that they ought\r\nnot to ascribe the misfortunes of the Romans to the bravery of the\r\nGauls, for the misconduct of the former had given them a triumph which\r\nthey did not deserve. It would, he urged, be a glorious thing, even at\r\nthe risk of some danger, to drive away a tribe of savage barbarians, who\r\nif they were victorious always exterminated the vanquished: while, if\r\nthey only showed bravery and confidence, he could, by watching his\r\nopportunity, lead them to certain victory. As the younger men eagerly\r\nlistened to these words, Camillus proceeded to confer with the chief\r\nmagistrates of the Ardeates. After obtaining their consent also, he\r\narmed all those who were capable of service, but kept them within the\r\nwalls, as he wished to conceal their presence from the enemy who were\r\nnow close at hand. But when the Gauls after scouring the country\r\nreturned laden with plunder and carelessly encamped in the plain, and\r\nwhen at night by the influence of wine and sleep all was quiet in their\r\ncamp, Camillus, who had learned the state of the case from spies, led\r\nout the men of Ardea, and marching over the intervening ground in\r\nsilence, about midnight attacked their entrenched camp with loud shouts\r\nand blasts of his trumpet, which threw the Gauls, half-drunk and heavy\r\nwith sleep as they were, into great confusion. Few recovered their\r\nsenses so far as to attempt to resist Camillus, and those few fell where\r\nthey stood; but most of them were slain as they lay helpless with wine\r\nand sleep. Such as escaped from the camp and wandered about the fields\r\nwere despatched by cavalry the next day.\r\n\r\nXXIV. The fame of this action, when noised among the neighbouring\r\ncities, called many men to arms, especially those Romans who had escaped\r\nto Veii after the battle of the Allia. These men lamented their fate,\r\nsaying, \"What a general has Providence removed from Rome in Camillus,\r\nwhose successes now bring glory to Ardea, while the city that produced\r\nand brought up so great a man has utterly perished. And now we, for want\r\nof a general to lead us, are sitting still inside the walls of a city\r\nnot our own, and giving up Italy to the enemy. Come, let us send to the\r\nmen of Ardea, and beg their general of them, or else ourselves take up\r\nour arms and march to him. He is no longer an exile, nor are we any\r\nlonger his countrymen, for our country is ours no more, but is in the\r\nhands of the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nThis was agreed, and they sent to beg Camillus to become their general.\r\nBut he refused, saying that he would not do so without a decree from the\r\ncitizens in the Capitol; for they as long as they survived, represented\r\nthe city of Rome, and therefore although he would gladly obey their\r\ncommands, he would not be so officious as to interfere against their\r\nwill. The soldiers admired the honourable scruples of Camillus, but\r\nthere was a great difficulty in representing them to the garrison of the\r\nCapitol; indeed, it seemed altogether impossible for a messenger to\r\nreach the citadel while the city was in the possession of the enemy.\r\n\r\nXXV. One of the younger Romans, Pontius Cominius, of the middle class of\r\ncitizens, but with an honourable ambition to distinguish himself,\r\nundertook the adventure. He would not take any writing to the garrison,\r\nfor fear that if he were taken the enemy might discover Camillus's\r\nplans. He dressed himself in poor clothes, with corks concealed under\r\nthem, and performed most of the journey fearlessly by daylight, but when\r\nhe came near the city he went by night. As it was impossible to cross\r\nthe river by the bridge, which was held by the Gauls, he wrapped what\r\nfew clothes he had round his head, and trusted to his corks to float him\r\nover to the city. After he had landed, he walked round, observing by the\r\nlights and the noise where the Gauls were most wakeful, until he reached\r\nthe Carmentan Gate, where all was quiet. At this place the Capitolian\r\nHill forms a steep and precipitous crag, up which he climbed by a hollow\r\nin the cliff, and joined the garrison. After greeting them and making\r\nknown his name, he proceeded to an interview with the leading men. A\r\nmeeting of the Senate was called, at which he recounted Camillus's\r\nvictory, which they had not heard of, and explained the determination of\r\nthe soldiers. He then begged them to confirm Camillus's appointment as\r\ngeneral, because the citizens without the walls would obey no other.\r\n\r\nWhen the Senate heard this, they deliberated, and finally appointed\r\nCamillus dictator, and sent back Pontius by the same way that he came,\r\nwhich he was able to accomplish as fortunately as before. He eluded the\r\nGauls, and brought the decree of the senate to the Romans outside the\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nXXVI. They heard the news with enthusiasm, so that Camillus when he\r\ncame, found that they already numbered twenty thousand, while he drew\r\nmany additional troops from the neighbouring friendly cities. Thus was\r\nCamillus a second time appointed dictator, and, proceeding to Veii,\r\njoined the soldiers there, to whom he added many others from the allies,\r\nand prepared to attack the enemy. But meanwhile at Rome, some of the\r\nGauls happening to pass by the place where Pontius climbed up the\r\nCapitol, noticed in many places the marks of where he had clutched at\r\nthe rock with his hands and feet, torn off the plants which grew upon\r\nit, and thrown down the mould. They brought the news to the king, who\r\ncame and viewed the place. He said nothing at the time, but in the\r\nevening he called together those Gauls who were lightest and most\r\naccustomed to climb mountains, and thus addressed them: \"The road up the\r\nrock, which we by ourselves could not discover, has been proved by our\r\nenemies not to be impassable to men, and it would be disgraceful for us\r\nafter having begun so well to leave our enterprise incomplete, and to\r\ngive up the place as impregnable after the enemy themselves have shown\r\nus how it may be taken. Where it is easy for one man to climb, it cannot\r\nbe hard for many to climb one by one, as their numbers will give them\r\nconfidence and mutual support. Suitable honours and presents will be\r\ngiven to those who distinguish themselves.\"\r\n\r\nXXVII. After this speech of their king, the Gauls eagerly volunteered\r\nfor the assault, and about midnight many of them climbed silently up the\r\nrock, which although rough and precipitous was easier of ascent than\r\nthey had imagined, so that the first of them reached the top, and were\r\non the point of preparing to attack the rampart and its sleeping\r\ngarrison, for neither men nor dogs noticed them. But there were sacred\r\ngeese kept in the temple of Juno, which in other times were fed without\r\nstint, but which then, as there was scarcely food enough for the men,\r\nwere somewhat neglected. These birds are naturally quick of hearing and\r\ntimid, and now being rendered wakeful and wild by hunger, quickly\r\nperceived the Gauls climbing up, and rushing noisily to the place woke\r\nthe garrison, while the Gauls feeling that they were discovered no\r\nlonger preserved silence, but violently assaulted the place. The Romans,\r\nsnatching up whatever arms came first to hand, ran to repulse them: and\r\nfirst of all Manlius, a man of consular rank, strong of body and full of\r\ncourage, fell in with two of the enemy. As one of them lifted up his\r\nbattleaxe, Manlius cut off his right hand with his sword, while he\r\ndashed his shield into the other's face, and threw him backwards down\r\nthe cliff. After this he stood upon the wall, and with the help of those\r\nwho assembled round him, beat off the rest, for not many had reached the\r\ntop, or effected anything commensurate with the boldness of the attempt.\r\nHaving thus escaped the danger, the Romans threw their sentinel down the\r\nrock; while on Manlius they conferred by vote a reward for his bravery,\r\nintended more for honour than advantage; for each man gave him a day's\r\nrations, which consisted of half a Roman pound of meal, and the fourth\r\npart of a Greek cotyle of wine.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. This affair disheartened the Gauls, who were also in want of\r\nprovisions, for they could not forage as before for fear of Camillus,\r\nwhile disease also crept in among them, encamped as they were in the\r\nruins of Rome among heaps of dead bodies, while the deep layer of ashes\r\nbecame blown by the wind into the air, making it dry and harsh, and the\r\nvapours of the conflagrations were injurious to breathe. They were\r\nespecially distressed by the change from a cloudy country where there\r\nare plenty of shady retreats, to the flat burning plains of Rome in\r\nautumn, and their siege of the Capitol became wearisome, for they had\r\nnow beleaguered it for seven months; so that there was much sickness in\r\ntheir camp, and so many died that they no longer buried the dead. Yet\r\nfor all this the besieged fared no better. Hunger pressed them, and\r\ntheir ignorance of what Camillus was doing disheartened them; for no one\r\ncould reach them with news, because the city was strictly watched by\r\nGauls. As both parties were in these straits, proposals for a\r\ncapitulation took place; at first among the outposts on both sides;\r\nafterwards the chief men on each side. Brennus, the Gaulish king, and\r\nSulpicius the Roman tribune, met, and it was agreed that the Romans\r\nshould pay a thousand pounds of gold, and that the Gauls should, on\r\nreceiving it, at once leave the country. Both parties swore to observe\r\nthese conditions, but when the gold was being weighed, the Gauls at\r\nfirst tampered with the scales unperceived, and then openly pulled the\r\nbeam, so that the Romans became angry. But at this Brennus insolently\r\ntook off his sword and belt, and flung them into the scale; and when\r\nSulpicius asked, \"What is this?\" \"What should it be,\" replied the Gaul;\r\n\"but woe to the vanquished!\" At this some of the Romans were angry and\r\nthought that they ought to take back their gold into the Capitol, and\r\nagain endure the siege; while others said that they must put up with\r\ninsults, provided they were not too outrageous, and not think that there\r\nwas any additional disgrace in paying more than they had agreed, because\r\nin paying any ransom at all, they were acting from sheer necessity\r\nrather than feelings of honour.\r\n\r\nXXIX. While the Romans were thus disputing with the Gauls, and with one\r\nanother, Camillus with his army was at the gates. Learning what was\r\nbeing done, he ordered the mass of his soldiers to follow him quietly\r\nand in good order, and himself pushed on with the picked troops to join\r\nthe Romans, who all made way for him, and received him as dictator with\r\nsilence and respect. He then took the gold from the scales and gave it\r\nto his victors, and ordered the Gauls to take the scales and the beam,\r\nand depart, \"for,\" said he, \"it is the custom of the Romans to defend\r\ntheir country not with gold but with iron.\" At this Brennus became\r\nangry, and said that he was being wronged by the treaty being broken;\r\nand Camillus answered that the negotiations were illegal, because when\r\nthey began he was already dictator, and therefore, as no one else had\r\nany authority, the treaty had been made by the Gauls with persons who\r\nwere not authorized to treat. But now, if they wished, they might make\r\nfresh proposals, for he was come with full legal powers to pardon such\r\nas made their submission, and to punish unrepentant evil-doers. Enraged\r\nat this, Brennus began to skirmish, and the two parties, mixed up as\r\nthey were, in houses and lands where no military formation was\r\npossible, did go so far as to draw their swords and push one another\r\nabout; but Brennus soon recovered his temper, and drew off the Gauls,\r\nwith but little loss, in their camp.\r\n\r\nDuring the night he got them all under arms, left the city, and, after a\r\nmarch of about eight miles, encamped by the side of the Gabinian Road.\r\nBut at daybreak, Camillus was upon him, in glittering armour, leading on\r\nthe Romans who had now recovered their courage. After a long and\r\nfiercely contested battle they routed the Gauls and took their camp.\r\nSome of the fugitives were at once pursued and slain, but most of them\r\nstraggled about the country, and were put to death by the people of the\r\nneighbouring towns and villages who sallied out upon them.\r\n\r\nXXX. Thus was Rome strangely taken, and yet more strangely preserved,\r\nafter having been for seven months in the possession of the Gauls, for\r\nthey entered it a few days after the Ides of Quintilis, and left it\r\nabout the Ides of February. Camillus, as we may easily imagine, entered\r\nthe city in a triumph, as the saviour of his lost country, and the\r\nrestorer of Rome to itself; for as he drove into the city he was\r\naccompanied by those who had before left it, with their wives and\r\nchildren, while those who had been besieged in the Capitol, and all but\r\nstarved there, came out to meet him embracing one another, weeping, and\r\nscarcely believing in their present happiness. The priests and servants\r\nof the gods also appeared with such of the sacred things as they had\r\nsaved, either by burying them on the spot, or by carrying them away, and\r\nnow displayed these images, which had not been seen for so long a time,\r\nto the citizens, who greeted them with joy, as if the gods themselves\r\nwere again returning to Rome. Camillus performed a sacrifice to the\r\ngods, and purified the city in the manner recommended by experts, and\r\nthen proceeded to restore all the previously existing temples, while he\r\nhimself added another to _Aius Loquutius_, or Rumour, having carefully\r\nsought out the place at which the voice in the night miraculously\r\nforetold the coming of the Gaulish host to Marcus Caedicius.\r\n\r\nXXXI. With great difficulty the sites of the temples were cleared of\r\nrubbish by the zeal of Camillus and the labour of the priests; but as\r\nthe city was utterly destroyed, and required to be entirely rebuilt, the\r\npeople became disheartened at so great an undertaking. Men who had lost\r\ntheir all were inclined to wait, and indeed required rest after their\r\nmisfortunes, rather than labours and toils, which neither their bodies\r\nnor their purses were able to endure. And thus it came to pass that they\r\nturned their thoughts a second time towards Veii, a city which stood\r\nquite ready to be inhabited. This gave opportunities to their mob\r\norators to make speeches, as usual, which they knew would be pleasing to\r\nthe people, in which Camillus was disrespectfully spoken of as depriving\r\nthem of a city which stood ready to receive them, for his own prviate\r\nambition, and was said to be compelling them to live encamped in the\r\nmidst of ruins, and re-erect their houses in that vast heap of ashes,\r\nall in order that he might be called, not merely the leader and general\r\nof Rome, but might usurp the place of Romulus and be called her founder.\r\nFearing disturbances, the Senate would not permit Camillus to lay down\r\nhis dictatorship for a year, although he wished to do so, and although\r\nno dictator before this had ever remained in office for more than six\r\nmonths. In the meantime the senators themselves encouraged and consoled\r\nthe people by personal appeals, pointing to the tombs and monuments of\r\ntheir ancestors, and recalling to their minds the temples and holy\r\nplaces which Romulus and Numa and the other kings had consecrated and\r\nleft in charge to them. More especially they dwelt upon the omen of the\r\nnewly severed head which had been found when the foundations of the\r\nCapitol were dug, by which it was proved that that spot was fated to\r\nbecome the head of Italy, and the fire of Vesta which the virgins had\r\nrelighted after the war, and which it would be a disgrace for them to\r\nextinguish, and to abandon the city, whether they were to see it\r\ninhabited by foreigners or turned into fields for cattle to feed in.\r\nWhile persistently urging these considerations both in public speeches\r\nand in private interviews with the people, they were much affected by\r\nthe lamentations of the poor over their helpless condition. The people\r\nbegged that, as they had, like people after a shipwreck, saved their\r\nlives and nothing else, they might not, in addition to this misfortune,\r\nbe compelled to put together the ruins of a city which had been utterly\r\ndestroyed, while another was standing ready to receive them.\r\n\r\nXXXII. Under these circumstances, Camillus determined to debate the\r\nquestion publicly. He himself made a long appeal on behalf of his native\r\nplace, and many other speeches were delivered. Finally he rose, and bade\r\nLucius Lucretius, whose privilege it was, to vote first, and then after\r\nhim the rest in order. Silence was enforced, and Lucretius was just on\r\nthe point of voting when a centurion in command of a detachment of the\r\nguard of the day marched by, and in a loud voice called to the\r\nstandard-bearer: \"Pitch the standard here: here it is best for us to\r\nstay.\" When these words were heard so opportunely in the midst of their\r\ndeliberations about the future, Lucretius reverently said that he\r\naccepted the omen, and gave his vote in accordance with it, and his\r\nexample was followed by all the rest. The people now showed a strange\r\nrevulsion of feeling, for they encouraged one another to begin the work\r\nof rebuilding, not on any regular plan, but just as each man happened to\r\nfind a convenient place for his work. Consequently they quickly rebuilt\r\nthe city, for within a year it is said that both the city walls and the\r\nprivate houses were completed; but it was full of intricate, narrow\r\nlanes and inconveniently placed houses.\r\n\r\nThe priests, who had been ordered by Camillus to mark out the boundaries\r\nwhere the temples had stood among the general wreck, when in their\r\ncircuit of the Palatine Hill they came upon the chapel of Mars, found\r\nit, like every other building, destroyed and levelled to the ground by\r\nthe Gauls, but while thoroughly examining the place they found the\r\naugur's staff of Romulus hidden under a deep heap of ashes. This staff\r\nis curved at one end, and is called _lituus_. They use it to divide the\r\nheavens into squares when taking the auspices, just as Romulus himself\r\ndid, as he was deeply skilled in divination. When he vanished from among\r\nmankind, the priests kept his staff just like any other sacred object.\r\nThat at such a time, when all the other holy things perished, this\r\nshould have been preserved, gave them good hopes of Rome, which that\r\nomen seemed to presage would be eternal.\r\n\r\nXXXIII. Before they had finished rebuilding the city they became\r\ninvolved in a war, for the Aequians, Volscians, and Latins combined\r\ntheir forces and invaded the country, while the Etruscans besieged\r\nSutrium, a city in alliance with Rome. The tribunes in command of the\r\nRoman forces encamped near the Marcian heights, and were there besieged\r\nby the Latins and in danger of having their camp taken. They sent to\r\nRome for assistance, and the Romans appointed Camillus dictator for the\r\nthird time. About this war there are two different accounts, of which I\r\nwill mention the legendary one first:--It is said that the Latins,\r\neither merely as a pretext, or really wishing to amalgamate the two\r\nraces as before, sent a demand to Rome for free unmarried women to be\r\ndelivered up for them to marry. As the Romans were at their wits' ends\r\nwhat to do, because they feared to go to war, being scarcely recovered\r\nfrom their late mishap, while they suspected that the women would be\r\nused as hostages if they gave them up, and that the proposal of\r\nintermarriage was merely a feint, a slave girl named Tutula, or, as some\r\nsay, Philotis, advised the magistrates to send her and the best-looking\r\nof the female slaves, dressed like brides of noble birth, and that she\r\nwould manage the rest. The magistrates approved of her proposal, chose\r\nsuch girls as she thought suitable, and having dressed them in fine\r\nclothes and jewellery, handed them over to the Latins, who were encamped\r\nat no great distance from the city. At night the girls stole the daggers\r\nof the enemies, and Tutula or Philotis climbed up a wild fig-tree,\r\nstretched out her cloak behind her, and raised a torch as a signal,\r\nwhich had been agreed upon between her and the magistrates, though no\r\nother citizen knew of it. Wherefore, the soldiers rushed out of the\r\ngates with a great clamour and disturbance, calling to one another and\r\nscarcely able to keep their ranks as their chiefs hurried them along.\r\nWhen they reached the enemy's camp, they found them asleep and not\r\nexpecting an attack, so that they took their camp and slew most of\r\nthem. This took place on the nones of the month Quintilis, now called\r\nJuly, and the festival which then takes place is in memory of the events\r\nof that day. First they march out of the gates in a mass, calling out\r\nthe common names of the country, such as Caius, Marcus, or Lucius, in\r\nimitation of their hurried calling for each other on that occasion.\r\nNext, female slaves splendidly dressed walk round laughing and romping\r\nwith all whom they meet. These girls also perform a sort of fight among\r\nthemselves, like those who on that day took their share in the fight\r\nwith the Latins: and afterwards they sit down to a feast, under the\r\nshade of fig-tree boughs. They call this day the _nonae caprotinae_,\r\nprobably from the wild fig-tree from which the slave girl waved the\r\ntorch; for in Latin a wild fig-tree is called _caprificus_. Others say\r\nthat most of these things were said and done when Romulus disappeared,\r\nfor on this very day he was snatched away, outside the city gates, in a\r\nsudden storm and darkness, or as some think during an eclipse of the\r\nsun: and they say that the day is called _nonae caprotiae_ from the\r\nplace, because Romulus was carried off while holding a meeting of the\r\nentire people at the place called the Goat's Marsh, as is written in his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nXXXIV. The other story is approved by most writers, who relate it as\r\nfollows:--Camillus, after being appointed dictator for the third time,\r\nand learning that the army under the command of the military tribunes\r\nwas being besieged by the Latins and Volscians, was compelled to arm\r\neven those citizens who were past the age for service in the field. He\r\nmarched by a long circuit to the Marcian heights unnoticed by the enemy,\r\nand established his army behind them. By lighting fires he announced his\r\narrival to the Romans in the camp, who took courage, and began to\r\nmeditate sallying out of their camp and attacking the enemy. But the\r\nLatins and Volscians kept close within the rampart of their camp, which\r\nthey fortified with many additional palisades, on all sides, for they\r\nnow were between two hostile armies, and intended to await succour from\r\nhome, while they also expected a force from Etruria to come to their\r\naid. Camillus, perceiving this, and fearing that he might be surrounded\r\nin his turn, vigorously used his opportunity. The rampart of the allies\r\nwas formed of wood, and as a strong wind blew down from the mountains at\r\ndaybreak, he prepared combustibles, and early in the morning got his\r\nforces under arms. One division he sent to attack the enemy's camp with\r\ndarts, and missile weapons, and loud shouts, while he himself, with\r\nthose who were in charge of the fire, waited for his opportunity on that\r\nside towards which the wind usually blew. When the other troops were\r\nengaged with the enemy, the sun rose, and a strong wind got up. At this\r\nCamillus gave the signal for attack, and at once enveloped the palisades\r\nwith lighted missiles. As the flames quickly spread in the thick wooden\r\npalisades, the Latins, finding their camp girt with flames, were driven\r\ninto a small compass, and finally obliged to sally out of their\r\nentrenchments, outside of which the Romans stood ready to receive them.\r\nFew of those who broke out escaped, while all who remained in the camp\r\nperished in the flames, until the Romans extinguished them and began to\r\nplunder.\r\n\r\nXXXV. After this exploit, Camillus left his son Lucius in charge of the\r\ncamp, to guard the prisoners and the booty, and himself invaded the\r\nenemy's country. He took the capital of the Aequi, reduced the Volsci to\r\nsubjection, and marched at once upon Sutrium to relieve that city, whose\r\ninhabitants had not heard of his successes, but were still besieged by\r\nthe Etruscans. The Sutrians had just surrendered, and had been turned\r\nout of their city by the enemy with nothing but the clothes they had on.\r\nCamillus met them on the road with their wives and children, weeping\r\nover their misfortune. He was greatly moved at so piteous a sight, and,\r\nperceiving that the Romans were touched by the despairing entreaties of\r\nthe people of Sutrium, who clung to them with tears in their eyes,\r\ndetermined that he would at once avenge their wrongs, and march upon\r\nSutrium that very day, arguing that men who were merry with success,\r\nhaving just captured a wealthy city, with no enemy either left within\r\nits walls or expected from without, would be found in careless disorder.\r\nIn this conjecture he was right; for he not only marched through the\r\ncountry, but even obtained possession of the walls and gates unperceived\r\nby the enemy, who had posted no guards, but were carousing in the\r\nvarious private houses. Indeed when they learned that the Romans were in\r\npossession of the town, they were in such a condition of intoxication\r\nthat most of them could not even attempt to escape, but shamefully\r\nwaited in the houses where they were until they were either killed or\r\ntaken prisoners. Thus was the city of Sutrium twice taken in one day,\r\nand thus did the victors lose their prize, and the dispossessed\r\ninhabitants regain their homes by Camillus's means.\r\n\r\nXXXVI. The triumph which he enjoyed after these campaigns added to his\r\npopularity and glory as much as either of the former; for even those who\r\ndisliked him most, and who had insisted that all his successes were due\r\nto good fortune more than to skill, were now forced to admit the\r\nbrilliancy of his generalship, and to give his genius its due. The chief\r\nof his enemies and detractors was Marcus Manlius, he who had been the\r\nfirst man to fling the Gauls down the cliff in the night attack on the\r\nCapitol, and who in remembrance of this was surnamed Capitolinus. This\r\nman, endeavouring to make himself the first man in Rome, and not being\r\nable to surpass the fame of Camillus by fair means, made the accusation\r\nagainst him usual in such cases, that he was intending to make himself\r\nking. This falsehood he repeated in his addresses to the people, with\r\nwhom he was making himself popular, especially with those who were in\r\ndebt; some of whom he defended, and assisted in coming to terms with\r\ntheir creditors, while others he forcibly rescued from the officers of\r\nthe law, so that many needy persons were attracted to him, and became\r\nthe terror of all respectable citizens by their riotous disturbances in\r\nthe Forum. To put an end to these disorders, Quintus Capitolinus was\r\ncreated dictator, and he put Manlius in prison; but the people upon this\r\nwent into mourning, a thing only done on the occasion of some great\r\npublic disaster, and the Senate, terrified at this, ordered Manlius to\r\nbe acquitted. Manlius was not improved by his captivity, but was more\r\nturbulent and disorderly in his conduct than he had been before.\r\nCamillus was now again elected military tribune, and Manlius was\r\nimpeached: but the place in which he was tried told greatly against his\r\naccusers. For the very spot on the Capitol on which Manlius fought with\r\nthe Gauls on that night was visible from the Forum, and the sight of it\r\nraised a strong feeling in his favour; while he himself pointed to it,\r\nand, with tears in his eyes, reminded them of how he had fought for\r\nthem, so that his judges were at their wits' end, and often adjourned\r\nthe trial, for they could not acquit him of a crime which was clearly\r\nproved against him, and yet they could not bring themselves to let the\r\nlaw take its course, when the scene before them reminded them constantly\r\nof his great exploit. Camillus, perceiving this, removed the court to\r\nthe Petelian Grove outside the city gates, where, as the Capitol was not\r\nvisible, the prosecutor was able to press home his charges against\r\nManlius, while the judges were not prevented from punishing him for his\r\nrecent crimes by their remembrance of what he had done in former times.\r\nHe was convicted, led to the Capitol, and thrown down the cliff, which\r\nthus witnessed both the most glorious deed of his life, and his\r\nmiserable end. The Romans destroyed his house, on the site of which they\r\nbuilt the Temple of Juno Moneta, and decreed that for the future no\r\npatrician might dwell upon the Capitol.\r\n\r\nXXXVII. Camillus, when appointed military tribune for the sixth time,\r\nbegged to be excused, as he was growing old, and perhaps feared that\r\nsuch unbroken success and glory would call down upon him the wrath of\r\nthe gods.[A] His most obvious reason for declining the appointment was\r\nthe state of his health, for at this time he was sick. However, the\r\npeople would not permit him to retire, but loudly urged that they did\r\nnot want him to ride on horseback or fight in the ranks, but merely to\r\nadvise and superintend. Thus they compelled him to accept the office,\r\nand with one of his colleagues, Lucius Furius, at once to lead an army\r\nagainst the enemy. He left the city and encamped near the enemy, where\r\nhe wished to remain inactive, in order that, if a battle should be\r\nnecessary, he might recover his health sufficiently to take part in it.\r\nBut as his colleague Lucius, who longed to distinguish himself, was so\r\neager for action that he could not be restrained, and excited the\r\nsubordinate officers, Camillus, fearing that it might be supposed that\r\nhe grudged younger men an opportunity of gaining laurels, agreed, sorely\r\nagainst his will, to allow his colleague to lead out the army and offer\r\nbattle, while he with a few troops remained behind in the camp. But when\r\nhe heard that Lucius had rashly engaged and that the Romans were\r\ndefeated, he could not restrain himself, but leaping from his couch met\r\nthem with his followers at the gate of the camp. Here he forced his way\r\nthrough the fugitives and attacked the pursuing force, so that those\r\nRomans whom he had passed at once turned and followed him, while those\r\nwho were still outside the camp rallied round him, calling upon one\r\nanother not to desert their general. The enemy's pursuit was thus\r\nchecked, and on the following day Camillus marched out with his entire\r\nforce, entirely defeated them, and entering their camp together with the\r\nfugitives, put most of them to the sword. After this, hearing that\r\nSatria had been captured by the Etruscans, and all the Roman colonists\r\nthere put to death, he sent the greater part of his force back to Rome,\r\nreserving only the youngest and most vigorous of the soldiers, with whom\r\nhe assaulted the Etruscans who held the city, and conquered them,\r\nkilling many, and putting the rest to flight.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The punishment of excessive and unbroken prosperity was\r\nassigned by the Greeks to the goddess Nemesis. The idea of too great a\r\ncareer of success exciting the anger of the gods is common throughout\r\nthe whole of ancient literature. A well-known instance is the story of\r\nPolykrates of Samos, as told by Herodotus. Amasis the king of Egypt,\r\nobserving the unbroken good fortune of Polykrates, advised him\r\nvoluntarily to sacrifice some of his treasures. Polykrates, following\r\nhis friend's advice, cast his signet-ring into the sea. But the ring was\r\nswallowed by a fish, and the fish was caught and presented to the king,\r\nwho thus recovered his ring. When Amasis heard of this, he refused to\r\nally himself with Polykrates, thinking that such good fortune presaged a\r\nterrible disaster. Polykrates was put to death shortly afterwards by the\r\nPersians, who conquered his kingdom.]\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. By his return to Rome with great spoils, he proved that those\r\nmen were right who had not feared that weakness or old age would impair\r\nthe faculties of a general of daring and experience, but who had chosen\r\nhim, ill and unwilling to act as he was, rather than men in the prime\r\nof life, who were eager to hold military commands. For this reason, when\r\nthe people of Tusculum were reported to be in insurrection, they bade\r\nCamillus take one of the other five tribunes as his colleague, and march\r\nagainst them. Camillus, in spite of all that the rest of the tribunes\r\ncould urge, for they all wished to be taken, chose Lucius Furius, whom\r\nno one could have supposed he would have chosen; for he it was who had\r\nbeen so eager to fight, against the better judgment of Camillus, and so\r\nhad brought about the defeat in the late war; however, Camillus chose\r\nhim rather than any other, wishing, it would appear, to conceal his\r\nmisfortune and wipe out his disgrace.\r\n\r\nThe people of Tusculum cleverly repaired their fault. When Camillus\r\nmarched to attack them they filled the country with men working in the\r\nfields and tending cattle just as in time of peace; the city gates were\r\nopen, the boys at school, the lower classes plying various trades, and\r\nthe richer citizens walking in the market-place in peaceful dress. The\r\nmagistrates bustled about the city, pointing out where the Romans were\r\nto be quartered, as if the thought of treachery had never entered their\r\nminds. Camillus, though this conduct did not shake his belief in their\r\nguilt, was moved to pity by their repentance. He ordered them to go to\r\nRome and beg the Senate to pardon them; and when they appeared, he\r\nhimself used his influence to procure their forgiveness, and the\r\nadmission of Tusculum to the Roman franchise. These were the most\r\nremarkable events of his sixth tribuneship.\r\n\r\nXXXIX. After this, Licinius Stolo put himself at the head of the\r\nplebeians in their great quarrel with the Senate. They demanded that\r\nconsuls should be re-established, one of whom should always be a\r\nplebeian, and that they should never both be patricians. Tribunes of the\r\npeople were appointed, but the people would not suffer any election of\r\nconsuls to be held. As this want of chief magistrates seemed likely to\r\nlead to still greater disorders, the Senate, much against the will of\r\nthe people, appointed Camillus dictator for the fourth time. He himself\r\ndid not wish for the post, for he was loth to oppose men who had been\r\nhis comrades in many hard-fought campaigns, as indeed he had spent much\r\nmore of his life in the camp with his soldiers than with the patrician\r\nparty in political intrigues, by one of which he was now appointed, as\r\nthat party hoped that if successful he would crush the power of the\r\nplebeians, while in case of failure he would be ruined. However, he made\r\nan effort to deal with the present difficulty. Knowing the day on which\r\nthe tribunes intended to bring forward their law, he published a\r\nmuster-roll of men for military service, and charged the people to leave\r\nthe Forum and meet him on the Field of Mars, threatening those who\r\ndisobeyed with a heavy fine. But when the tribunes answered his threats\r\nby vowing that they would fine him fifty thousand _drachmas_ unless he\r\nceased his interference with the people's right of voting, he retired to\r\nhis own house, and after a few days laid down his office on pretence of\r\nsickness. This he did, either because he feared a second condemnation\r\nand banishment, which would be a disgrace to an old man and one who had\r\ndone such great deeds, or else because he saw that the people were too\r\nstrong to be overpowered, and he did not wish to make the attempt.\r\n\r\nThe Senate appointed another dictator, but he made that very Licinius\r\nStolo, the leader of the popular party, his master of the horse, and\r\nthus enabled him to pass a law which was especially distasteful to the\r\npatricians, for it forbade any one to possess more than five hundred\r\n_jugera_ of land. Stolo, after this success, became an important\r\npersonage; but, a short time afterwards, he was convicted of possessing\r\nmore land than his own law permitted, and was punished according to its\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\nXL. There still remained the difficulty about the consular elections,\r\nthe most important point at issue between the two parties, and the\r\nSenate was greatly disturbed at it, when news arrived that the Gauls,\r\nstarting from the Adriatic Sea, were a second time marching in great\r\nforce upon Rome. At the same time evident traces of their approach could\r\nbe seen, as the country was being plundered, and such of the inhabitants\r\nas could not easily reach Rome were taking refuge in the mountains.\r\n\r\nThis terrible tidings put an end to all internal disputes. The Senate\r\nand people formed themselves into one assembly, and with one voice\r\nappointed Camillus dictator for the fifth time. He was now a very old\r\nman, being near his eightieth year; but at this pressing crisis he made\r\nnone of his former excuses, but at once took the chief command and\r\nlevied an army for the war. As he knew that the chief power of the Gauls\r\nlay in their swords, with which they dealt heavy blows on the heads and\r\nshoulders of their enemy, without any skill in fence, he prepared for\r\nmost of his soldiers helmets made entirely of smooth iron, so that the\r\nswords would either break or glance off them, while he also had brass\r\nrims fitted to their shields, because the wood by itself could not\r\nendure a blow. He also instructed the soldiers to use long pikes, and to\r\nthrust them forward to receive the sword-cuts of the enemy.\r\n\r\nXLI. When the Gauls were encamped on the banks of the Anio, near the\r\ncity, loaded with masses of plunder, Camillus led out his troops and\r\nposted them in a glen from which many valleys branched out, so that the\r\ngreater part of the force was concealed, and that which was seen\r\nappeared to be clinging in terror to the hilly ground. Camillus, wishing\r\nto confirm the enemy in this idea, would not move to prevent the country\r\nbeing plundered before his eyes, but palisaded his camp and remained\r\nquiet within it, until he saw that the foraging parties of the Gauls\r\nstraggled in careless disorder, while those in the camp did nothing but\r\neat and drink. Then, sending forward his light troops before daybreak to\r\nbe ready to harass the Gauls and prevent their forming their ranks\r\nproperly as they came out of their camp, he marched the heavy-armed men\r\ndown into the plain at sunrise, a numerous and confident body, and not,\r\nas the Gauls fancied, a few disheartened men.\r\n\r\nThe very fact of his commencing the attack dashed the courage of the\r\nGauls; next, the attacks of the light troops, before they had got into\r\ntheir wonted array and divided themselves into regiments, produced\r\ndisorder. When at last Camillus led on the heavy-armed troops, the Gauls\r\nran to meet them brandishing their swords, but the Romans with their\r\npikes advanced and met them, receiving their sword-cuts on their armour,\r\nwhich soon made the Gaulish swords bend double, as they were made of\r\nsoft iron hammered out thin, while the shields of the Gauls were\r\npierced and weighed down by the pikes that stuck in them. They therefore\r\ndropped their own arms, and endeavoured to seize the pikes and turn them\r\nagainst their enemies. But the Romans, seeing them now defenceless,\r\nbegan to use their swords, and slew many of the first ranks, while the\r\nrest took to flight all over the flat country; for Camillus had taken\r\ncare to guard the hills and rough ground, while the Gauls knew that\r\nthey, in their over-confidence, had been at no pains to fortify their\r\ncamp, and that the Romans could easily take it.\r\n\r\nThis battle is said to have been fought thirteen years after the capture\r\nof Rome, and in consequence of it the Romans conceived a contempt for\r\nthese barbarians, whom they had before greatly dreaded, and even\r\nbelieved that their former victories over the Gauls were due to their\r\nbeing weakened by pestilence, and to fortunate circumstances, rather\r\nthan to their own valour. This raised so great a terror of them, that a\r\nlaw was passed which relieved the priests from military service except\r\nin case of a Gaulish invasion.\r\n\r\nXLII. This was the last of Camillus's military exploits, though during\r\nthis campaign he took the city of Velitrae, which yielded to him without\r\na battle. But his greatest political struggle was yet to come, for it\r\nwas harder to deal with the people now that they were elated with\r\nvictory. They insisted that the existing constitution should be\r\nannulled, and that one of the two consuls should be chosen from among\r\nthem. They were opposed by the Senate, which would not permit Camillus\r\nto lay down his office, as the patricians imagined that with the help of\r\nhis great power they could more easily defend their privileges. One day,\r\nhowever, as Camillus was sitting publicly doing business in the Forum, a\r\nviator or servant sent by the tribunes of the people bade him follow\r\nhim, and even laid his hand upon him as if to arrest him. At this such a\r\ndisturbance arose as had never been known before, as Camillus's party\r\nendeavoured to push the officer down from the tribunal, while the people\r\nclamoured to him to drag the dictator from his seat. Camillus himself,\r\nnot knowing what to do, would not lay down his office, but called the\r\nSenate to meet. Before entering the Senate house, he turned round to\r\nthe Capitol and prayed that the gods would bring affairs to a happy\r\ntermination, vowing that when the present disorders were at an end he\r\nwould build a Temple of Concord. After a violent debate, the Senate\r\nagreed to adopt the milder course of yielding to the popular demand, and\r\npermitting one of the two consuls to be chosen from the people. When the\r\ndictator announced this decision of the Senate to the people, they at\r\nonce, as was natural, were delighted with the Senate, and escorted\r\nCamillus home with applause and shouts. On the next day they met and\r\ndecreed that the Temple of Concord which Camillus had vowed should be\r\nerected on a spot facing the Forum, where these events had taken place;\r\nmoreover, that the Latin games should continue for four days instead of\r\nthree, and that all citizens of Rome should at once offer sacrifice and\r\ncrown themselves with garlands.\r\n\r\nIn the assembly for the election of consuls, over which Camillus\r\npresided there were elected Marcus Aemilius, a patrician, and Lucius\r\nSextius, the first plebeian ever elected consul. This was the result of\r\nCamillus's administration.\r\n\r\nXLIII. In the following year a pestilence broke out in Rome which\r\ndestroyed enormous numbers of people, and among them most of the leading\r\nmen. And in this year died Camillus, at a ripe old age, full of years\r\nand honours, more regretted by the Romans than all those who died of the\r\nplague.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF PERIKLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. One day in Rome, Caesar, seeing some rich foreigners nursing and\r\npetting young lapdogs and monkeys, enquired whether in their parts of\r\nthe world the women bore no children: a truly imperial reproof to those\r\nwho waste on animals the affection which they ought to bestow upon\r\nmankind. May we not equally blame those who waste the curiosity and love\r\nof knowledge which belongs to human nature, by directing it to\r\nworthless, not to useful objects? It is indeed unavoidable that external\r\nobjects, whether good or bad, should produce some effect upon our\r\nsenses; but every man is able, if he chooses, to concentrate his mind\r\nupon any subject he may please. For this reason we ought to seek virtue,\r\nnot merely in order to contemplate it, but that we may ourselves derive\r\nsome benefit from so doing. Just as those colours whose blooming and\r\npleasant hues refresh our sight are grateful to the eyes, so we ought by\r\nour studies to delight in that which is useful for our own lives; and\r\nthis is to be found in the acts of good men, which when narrated incite\r\nus to imitate them. The effect does not take place in other cases, for\r\nwe frequently admire what we do not wish to produce; indeed we often are\r\ncharmed with the work, but despise the workman, as in the case of dyes\r\nand perfumery which we take pleasure in, although we regard dyers and\r\nperfumers as vulgar artizans. That was a clever saying of Antisthenes,\r\nwho answered, when he heard that Ismenias was a capital flute-player,\r\n\"But he must be a worthless man, for if he were not, he would not be\r\nsuch a capital flute-player!\" and King Philip of Macedon, when his son\r\nplayed brilliantly and agreeably on the harp at an entertainment, said\r\nto him, \"Are you not ashamed, to play so well?\"\r\n\r\nIt is enough for a king, if he sometimes employs his leisure in\r\nlistening to musicians, and it is quite a sufficient tribute from him to\r\nthe Muses, if he is present at the performances of other persons.\r\n\r\nII. If a man devotes himself to these trifling arts, the time which he\r\nwastes upon them proves that he is incapable of higher things. No well\r\nnurtured youth, on seeing the statue of Jupiter Olympius at Pisa, wishes\r\nthat he were a Pheidias, or that he were a Polykleitus on seeing the\r\nstatue of Juno at Argos, nor yet while he takes pleasure in poetry, does\r\nhe wish that he were an Anakreon, a Philetas, or an Archilochus; for it\r\ndoes not necessarily follow that we esteem the workman because we are\r\npleased with the work. For this reason men are not benefited by any\r\nspectacle which does not encourage them to imitation, and where\r\nreflection upon what they have observed does not make them also wish to\r\ndo likewise; whereas we both admire the deeds to which virtue incites,\r\nand long to emulate the doers of them.\r\n\r\nWe enjoy the good things which we owe to fortune, but we admire virtuous\r\nactions; and while we wish to receive the former, we wish ourselves to\r\nbenefit others by the latter. That which is in itself admirable kindles\r\nin us a desire of emulation, whether we see noble deeds presented before\r\nus, or read of them in history. It was with this purpose that I have\r\nengaged in writing biography, and have arranged this tenth book to\r\ncontain the lives of Perikles and of Fabius Maximus, who fought against\r\nHannibal, men who especially resembled one another in the gentleness and\r\njustice of their disposition, and who were both of the greatest service\r\nto their native countries, because they were able to endure with\r\npatience the follies of their governments and colleagues. Of my success,\r\nthe reader of the following pages will be able to judge for themself.\r\n\r\nIII. Perikles was of the tribe Akamantis, and of the township of\r\nCholargos, and was descended from the noblest families in Athens, on\r\nboth his father's and mother's side. His father, Xanthippus, defeated\r\nthe Persian generals at Mykalé, while his mother, Agariste, was a\r\ndescendant of Kleisthenes, who drove the sons of Peisistratus out of\r\nAthens, put an end to their despotic rule, and established a new\r\nconstitution admirably calculated to reconcile all parties and save the\r\ncountry. She dreamed that she had brought forth a lion, and a few days\r\nafterwards was delivered of Perikles. His body was symmetrical, but his\r\nhead was long out of all proportion; for which reason in nearly all his\r\nstatues he is represented wearing a helmet, as the sculptors did not\r\nwish, I suppose, to reproach him with this blemish. The Attic poets\r\ncalled him squill-head, and the comic poet, Kratinus, in his play\r\n'Cheirones,' says,\r\n\r\n    \"From Kronos old and faction,\r\n      Is sprung a tyrant dread,\r\n    And all Olympus calls him,\r\n      The man-compelling head.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again in the play of 'Nemesis'\r\n\r\n    \"Come, hospitable Zeus, with lofty head.\"\r\n\r\nTelekleides, too, speaks of him as sitting\r\n\r\n                      \"Bowed down\r\n          With a dreadful frown,\r\n    Because matters of state have gone wrong,\r\n          Until at last,\r\n          From his head so vast,\r\n    His ideas burst forth in a throng.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Eupolis, in his play of 'Demoi,' asking questions about each of the\r\ngreat orators as they come up from the other world one after the other,\r\nwhen at last Perikles ascends, says,\r\n\r\n    \"The great headpiece of those below.\"\r\n\r\nIV. Most writers tell us that his tutor in music was Damon, whose name\r\nthey say should be pronounced with the first syllable short. Aristotle,\r\nhowever, says that he studied under Pythokleides. This Damon, it seems,\r\nwas a sophist of the highest order, who used the name of music to\r\nconceal this accomplishment from the world, but who really trained\r\nPerikles for his political contests just as a trainer prepares an\r\nathlete for the games. However, Damon's use of music as a pretext did\r\nnot impose upon the Athenians, who banished him by ostracism, as a\r\nbusybody and lover of despotism. He was ridiculed by the comic poets;\r\nthus Plato represents some one as addressing him,\r\n\r\n    \"Answer me this, I humbly do beseech,\r\n    For thou, like Cheiron, Perikles did'st teach.\"\r\n\r\nPerikles also attended the lectures of Zeno, of Elea, on natural\r\nphilosophy, in which that philosopher followed the method of Parmenides.\r\nZeno moreover had made an especial study of how to reduce any man to\r\nsilence who questioned him, and how to enclose him between the horns of\r\na dilemma, which is alluded to by Timon of Phlius in the following\r\nverses:\r\n\r\n    \"Nor weak the strength of him of two-edged tongue,\r\n    Zeno that carps at all.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was Anaxagoras of Klazomenae who had most to do with forming\r\nPerikles's style, teaching him an elevation and sublimity of expression\r\nbeyond that of ordinary popular speakers, and altogether purifying and\r\nennobling his mind. This Anaxagoras was called Nous, or Intelligence, by\r\nthe men of that day, either because they admired his own intellect, or\r\nbecause he taught that an abstract intelligence is to be traced in all\r\nthe concrete forms of matter, and that to this, and not to chance, the\r\nuniverse owes its origin.\r\n\r\nV. Perikles greatly admired Anaxagoras, and became deeply interested in\r\nthese grand speculations, which gave him a haughty spirit and a lofty\r\nstyle of oratory far removed from vulgarity and low buffoonery, and also\r\nan imperturbable gravity of countenance, and a calmness of demeanour and\r\nappearance which no incident could disturb as he was speaking, while the\r\ntone of his voice never showed that he heeded any interruption. These\r\nadvantages greatly impressed the people. Once he sat quietly all day in\r\nthe market-place despatching some pressing business, reviled in the\r\nfoulest terms all the while by some low worthless fellow. Towards\r\nevening he walked home, the man following him and heaping abuse upon\r\nhim. When about to enter his own door, as it was dark, he ordered one of\r\nhis servants to take a torch and light the man home. The poet Ion,\r\nhowever, says that Perikles was overbearing and insolent in\r\nconversation, and that his pride had in it a great deal of contempt for\r\nothers; while he praises Kimon's civil, sensible, and polished address.\r\nBut we may disregard Ion, as a mere dramatic poet who always sees in\r\ngreat men something upon which to exercise his satiric vein; whereas\r\nZeno used to invite those who called the haughtiness of Perikles a mere\r\ncourting of popularity and affectation of grandeur, to court popularity\r\nthemselves in the same fashion, since the acting of such a part might\r\ninsensibly mould their dispositions until they resembled that of their\r\nmodel.\r\n\r\nVI. These were not the only advantages which Perikles gained from his\r\nintimacy with Anaxagoras, but he seems to have learned to despise those\r\nsuperstitious fears which the common phenomena of the heavens produce in\r\nthose who, ignorant of their cause, and knowing nothing about them,\r\nrefer them all to the immediate action of the gods. Knowledge of\r\nphysical science, while it puts an end to superstitious terrors,\r\nreplaces them by a sound basis of piety. It is said that once a ram with\r\none horn was sent from the country as a present to Perikles, and that\r\nLampon the prophet, as soon as he saw this strong horn growing out of\r\nthe middle of the creature's forehead, said that as there were two\r\nparties in the state, that of Thucydides and that of Perikles, he who\r\npossessed this mystic animal would unite the two into one. Anaxagoras\r\ncut open the beast's skull, and pointed out that its brain did not fill\r\nthe whole space, but was sunken into the shape of an egg, and all\r\ncollected at that part from which the horn grew. At the time all men\r\nlooked with admiration on Anaxagoras, but afterwards, when Thucydides\r\nhad fallen, and all the state had become united under Perikles, they\r\nadmired Lampon equally.\r\n\r\nThere is, I imagine, no reason why both the prophet and the natural\r\nphilosopher should not have been right, the one discovering the cause,\r\nand the other the meaning. The one considered why the horn grew so, and\r\nfor what reason; the other declared what it _meant_ by growing so, and\r\nfor what _end_ it took place. Those who say that when the cause of a\r\nportent is found out the portent is explained away, do not reflect that\r\nthe same reasoning which explains away heavenly portents would also put\r\nan end to the meaning of the conventional signals used by mankind. The\r\nringing of bells, the blaze of beacon fires, and the shadows on a dial\r\nare all of them produced by natural causes, but have a further meaning.\r\nBut perhaps all this belongs to another subject.\r\n\r\nVII. Perikles when young greatly feared the people. He had a certain\r\npersonal likeness to the despot Peisistratus; and as his own voice was\r\nsweet, and he was ready and fluent in speech, old men who had known\r\nPeisistratus were struck by his resemblance to him. He was also rich, of\r\nnoble birth, and had powerful friends, so that he feared he might be\r\nbanished by ostracism, and consequently held aloof from politics, but\r\nproved himself a brave and daring soldier in the wars. But when\r\nAristeides was dead, Themistokles banished, and Kimon generally absent\r\non distant campaigns, Perikles engaged in public affairs, taking the\r\npopular side, that of the poor and many against that of the rich and\r\nfew, quite contrary to his own feelings, which were entirely\r\naristocratic. He feared, it seems, that he might be suspected of a\r\ndesign to make himself despot, and seeing that Kimon took the side of\r\nthe nobility, and was much beloved by them, he betook himself to the\r\npeople, as a means of obtaining safety for himself, and a strong party\r\nto combat that of Kimon. He immediately altered his mode of life; was\r\nnever seen in any street except that which led to the market-place and\r\nthe national assembly, and declined all invitations to dinner and such\r\nlike social gatherings, so utterly that during the whole of his long\r\npolitical life he never dined with one of his friends, except when his\r\nfirst cousin, Euryptolemus, was married. On this occasion he sat at\r\ntable till the libations were poured, upon which he at once got up and\r\nwent away. For solemnity is wont to unbend at festive gatherings, and a\r\nmajestic demeanour is hard to keep up when one is in familiar\r\nintercourse with others. True virtue, indeed, appears more glorious the\r\nmore it is seen, and a really good man's life is never so much admired\r\nby the outside world as by his own intimate friends. But Perikles feared\r\nto make himself too common even with the people, and only addressed\r\nthem after long intervals--not speaking upon every subject, and, not\r\nconstantly addressing them, but, as Kritolaus says, keeping himself like\r\nthe Salaminian trireme for great crises, and allowing his friends and\r\nthe other orators to manage matters of less moment. One of these friends\r\nis said to have been Ephialtes, who destroyed the power of the Council\r\nof the Areopagus, \"pouring out,\" as Plato, the comic poet, said, \"a full\r\nand unmixed draught of liberty for the citizens,\" under the influence of\r\nwhich the poets of the time said that the Athenian people\r\n\r\n    \"Nibbled at Euboea, like a horse that spurns the rein,\r\n    And wantonly would leap upon the islands in the main.\"\r\n\r\nVIII. Wishing to adopt a style of speaking consonant with his haughty\r\nmanner and lofty spirit, Perikles made free use of the instrument which\r\nAnaxagoras as it were put into his hand, and often tinged his oratory\r\nwith natural philosophy. He far surpassed all others by using this\r\n\"lofty intelligence and power of universal consummation,\" as the divine\r\nPlato calls it;[A] in addition to his natural advantages, adorning his\r\noratory with apt illustrations drawn from physical science.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Plato, Phaedrus.]\r\n\r\nFor this reason some think that he was nicknamed the Olympian; though\r\nsome refer this to his improvement of the city by new and beautiful\r\nbuildings, and others from his power both as a politician and a general.\r\nIt is not by any means unlikely that these causes all combined to\r\nproduce the name. Yet the comedies of that time, when they allude to\r\nhim, either in jest or earnest, always appear to think that this name\r\nwas given him because of his manner of speaking, as they speak of him as\r\n\"thundering and lightening,\" and \"rolling fateful thunders from his\r\ntongue.\" A saying of Thucydides, the son of Melesias, has been\r\npreserved, which jestingly testifies to the power of Perikles's\r\neloquence. Thucydides was the leader of the conservative party, and for\r\na long time struggled to hold his own against Perikles in debate. One\r\nday Archidamus, the King of Sparta, asked him whether he or Perikles was\r\nthe best wrestler. \"When I throw him in wrestling,\" Thucydides answered,\r\n\"he beats me by proving that he never was down, and making the\r\nspectators believe him.\" For all this Perikles was very cautious about\r\nhis words, and whenever he ascended the tribune to speak, used first to\r\npray to the gods that nothing unfitted for the present occasion might\r\nfall from his lips. He left no writings, except the measures which he\r\nbrought forward, and very few of his sayings are recorded. One of these\r\nwas, that he called Aegina \"the eyesore of the Peiraeus,\" and that \"he\r\nsaw war coming upon Athens from Peloponnesus.\" Stesimbrotus tells us\r\nthat when he was pronouncing a public funeral oration over those who\r\nfell in Samos, he said that they had become immortal, even as the gods:\r\nfor we do not see the gods, but we conceive them to be immortal by the\r\nrespect which we pay them, and the blessings which we receive from them;\r\nand the same is the case with those who die for their country.\r\n\r\nIX. Thucydides represents the constitution under Perikles as a democracy\r\nin name, but really an aristocracy, because the government was all in\r\nthe hands of one leading citizen. But as many other writers tell us that\r\nduring his administration the people received grants of land abroad, and\r\nwere indulged with dramatic entertainments, and payments for their\r\nservices, in consequence of which they fell into bad habits, and became\r\nextravagant and licentious, instead of sober hard-working people as they\r\nhad been before, let us consider the history of this change, viewing it\r\nby the light of the facts themselves. First of all, as we have already\r\nsaid, Perikles had to measure himself with Kimon, and to transfer the\r\naffections of the people from Kimon to himself. As he was not so rich a\r\nman as Kimon, who used from his own ample means to give a dinner daily\r\nto any poor Athenian who required it, clothe aged persons, and take away\r\nthe fences round his property, so that any one might gather the fruit,\r\nPerikles, unable to vie with him in this, turned his attention to a\r\ndistribution of the public funds among the people, at the suggestion, we\r\nare told by Aristotle, of Damonides of Oia. By the money paid for public\r\nspectacles, for citizens acting as jurymen and other paid offices, and\r\nlargesses, he soon won over the people to his side, so that he was able\r\nto use them in his attack upon the Senate of the Areopagus, of which he\r\nhimself was not a member, never having been chosen Archon, or\r\nThesmothete, or King Archon, or Polemarch. These offices had from\r\nancient times been obtained by lot, and it was only through them that\r\nthose who had approved themselves in the discharge of them were advanced\r\nto the Areopagus. For this reason it was that Perikles, when he gained\r\nstrength with the populace, destroyed this Senate, making Ephialtes\r\nbring forward a bill which restricted its judicial powers, while he\r\nhimself succeeded in getting Kimon banished by ostracism, as a friend of\r\nSparta and a hater of the people, although he was second to no Athenian\r\nin birth or fortune, had won most brilliant victories over the Persians,\r\nand had filled Athens with plunder and spoils of war, as will be found\r\nrelated in his life. So great was the power of Perikles with the common\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nX. One of the provisions of ostracism was that the person banished\r\nshould remain in exile for ten years. But during this period the\r\nLacedaemonians with a great force invaded the territory of Tanagra, and,\r\nas the Athenians at once marched out to attack them, Kimon came back\r\nfrom exile, took his place in full armour among the ranks of his own\r\ntribe, and hoped by distinguishing himself in the battle amongst his\r\nfellow citizens to prove the falsehood of the Laconian sympathies with\r\nwhich he had been charged. However, the friends of Perikles drove him\r\naway, as an exile. On the other hand, Perikles fought more bravely in\r\nthat battle than he had ever fought before, and surpassed every one in\r\nreckless daring. The friends of Kimon also, whom Perikles had accused of\r\nLaconian leanings, fell, all together, in their ranks; and the Athenians\r\nfelt great sorrow for their treatment of Kimon, and a great longing for\r\nhis restoration, now that they had lost a great battle on the frontier,\r\nand expected to be hard pressed during the summer by the Lacedaemonians.\r\nPerikles, perceiving this, lost no time in gratifying the popular wish,\r\nbut himself proposed the decree for his recall; and Kimon on his return\r\nreconciled the two States, for he was on familiar terms with the\r\nSpartans, who were hated by Perikles and the other leaders of the common\r\npeople. Some say that, before Kimon's recall by Perikles, a secret\r\ncompact was made with him by Elpinike, Kimon's sister, that Kimon was\r\nto proceed on foreign service against the Persians with a fleet of two\r\nhundred ships, while Perikles was to retain his power in the city. It is\r\nalso said that, when Kimon was being tried for his life, Elpinike\r\nsoftened the resentment of Perikles, who was one of those appointed to\r\nimpeach him. When Elpinike came to beg her brother's life of him, he\r\nanswered with a smile, \"Elpinike, you are too old to meddle in affairs\r\nof this sort.\" But, for all that, he spoke only once, for form's sake,\r\nand pressed Kimon less than any of his other prosecutors. How, then, can\r\none put any faith in Idomeneus, when he accuses Perikles of procuring\r\nthe assassination of his friend and colleague Ephialtes, because he was\r\njealous of his reputation? This seems an ignoble calumny, which\r\nIdomeneus has drawn from some obscure source to fling at a man who, no\r\ndoubt, was not faultless, but of a generous spirit and noble mind,\r\nincapable of entertaining so savage and brutal a design. Ephialtes was\r\ndisliked and feared by the nobles, and was inexorable in punishing those\r\nwho wronged the people; wherefore his enemies had him assassinated by\r\nmeans of Aristodikus of Tanagra. This we are told by Aristotle. Kimon\r\ndied in Cyprus, while in command of the Athenian forces.\r\n\r\nXI. The nobles now perceived that Perikles was the most important man in\r\nthe State, and far more powerful than any other citizen; wherefore, as\r\nthey still hoped to check his authority, and not allow him to be\r\nomnipotent, they set up Thucydides, of the township of Alopekae, as his\r\nrival, a man of good sense, and a relative of Kimon, but less of a\r\nwarrior and more of a politician, who, by watching his opportunities,\r\nand opposing Perikles in debate, soon brought about a balance of power.\r\nHe did not allow the nobles to mix themselves up with the people in the\r\npublic assembly, as they had been wont to do, so that their dignity was\r\nlost among the masses; but he collected them into a separate body, and\r\nby thus concentrating their strength was able to use it to\r\ncounterbalance that of the other party. From the beginning these two\r\nfactions had been but imperfectly welded together, because their\r\ntendencies were different; but now the struggle for power between\r\nPerikles and Thucydides drew a sharp line of demarcation between them,\r\nand one was called the party of the Many, the other that of the Few.\r\nPerikles now courted the people in every way, constantly arranging\r\npublic spectacles, festivals, and processions in the city, by which he\r\neducated the Athenians to take pleasure in refined amusements; and also\r\nhe sent out sixty triremes to cruise every year, in which many of the\r\npeople served for hire for eight months, learning and practising\r\nseamanship. Besides this he sent a thousand settlers to the Chersonese,\r\nfive hundred to Naxos, half as many to Andros, a thousand to dwell among\r\nthe Thracian tribe of the Bisaltae, and others to the new colony in\r\nItaly founded by the city of Sybaris, which was named Thurii. By this\r\nmeans he relieved the state of numerous idle agitators, assisted the\r\nnecessitous, and overawed the allies of Athens by placing his colonists\r\nnear them to watch their behaviour.\r\n\r\nXII. The building of the temples, by which Athens was adorned, the\r\npeople delighted, and the rest of the world astonished, and which now\r\nalone prove that the tales of the ancient power and glory of Greece are\r\nno fables, was what particularly excited the spleen of the opposite\r\nfaction, who inveighed against him in the public assembly, declaring\r\nthat the Athenians had disgraced themselves by transferring the common\r\ntreasury of the Greeks from the island of Delos to their own custody.\r\n\"Perikles himself,\" they urged, \"has taken away the only possible excuse\r\nfor such an act--the fear that it might be exposed to the attacks of the\r\nPersians when at Delos, whereas it would be safe at Athens. Greece has\r\nbeen outraged, and feels itself openly tyrannised over, when it sees us\r\nusing the funds which we extorted from it for the war against the\r\nPersians, for gilding and beautifying our city, as if it were a vain\r\nwoman, and adorning it with precious marbles, and statues, and temples,\r\nworth a thousand talents.\" To this Perikles replied, that the allies had\r\nno right to consider how their money was spent, so long as Athens\r\ndefended them from the Persians; while they supplied neither horses,\r\nships, nor men, but merely money, which the Athenians had a right to\r\nspend as they pleased, provided they afforded them that security which\r\nit purchased. It was right, he argued, that, after the city had provided\r\nall that was necessary for war, it should devote its surplus money to\r\nthe erection of buildings which would be a glory to it for all ages,\r\nwhile these works would create plenty by leaving no man unemployed, and\r\nencouraging all sorts of handicraft, so that nearly the whole city would\r\nearn wages, and thus derive both its beauty and its profit from itself.\r\nFor those who were in the flower of their age, military service offered\r\na means of earning money from the common stock; while, as he did not\r\nwish the mechanics and lower classes to be without their share, nor yet\r\nto see them receive it without doing work for it, he had laid the\r\nfoundations of great edifices which would require industries of every\r\nkind to complete them; and he had done this in the interests of the\r\nlower classes, who thus, although they remained at home, would have just\r\nas good a claim to their share of the public funds as those who were\r\nserving at sea, in garrison, or in the field. The different materials\r\nused, such as stone, brass, ivory, gold, ebony, cypress-wood, and so\r\nforth, would require special artizans for each, such as carpenters,\r\nmodellers, smiths, stone masons, dyers, melters and moulders of gold,\r\nand ivory painters, embroiderers, workers in relief; and also men to\r\nbring them to the city, such as sailors and captains of ships and pilots\r\nfor such as came by sea; and, for those who came by land, carriage\r\nbuilders, horse breeders, drivers, rope makers, linen manufacturers,\r\nshoemakers, road menders, and miners. Each trade, moreover, employed a\r\nnumber of unskilled labourers, so that, in a word, there would be work\r\nfor persons of every age and every class, and general prosperity would\r\nbe the result.\r\n\r\nXIII. These buildings were of immense size, and unequalled in beauty and\r\ngrace, as the workmen endeavoured to make the execution surpass the\r\ndesign in beauty; but what was most remarkable was the speed with which\r\nthey were built. All these edifices, each of which one would have\r\nthought, it would have taken many generations to complete, were all\r\nfinished during the most brilliant period of one man's administration.\r\nWe are told that Zeuxis, hearing Agatharchus, the painter, boasting how\r\neasily and rapidly he could produce a picture, said, \"I paint very\r\nslowly.\" Ease, and speed of execution, seldom produces work of any\r\npermanent value or delicacy. It is the time which is spent in laborious\r\nproduction for which we are repaid by the durable character of the\r\nresult. And this makes Perikles's work all the more wonderful, because\r\nit was built in a short time, and yet has lasted for ages. In beauty\r\neach of them at once appeared venerable as soon as it was built; but\r\neven at the present day the work looks as fresh as ever, for they bloom\r\nwith an eternal freshness which defies time, and seems to make the work\r\ninstinct with an unfading spirit of youth.\r\n\r\nThe overseer and manager of the whole was Pheidias, although there were\r\nother excellent architects and workmen, such as Kallikrates and Iktinus,\r\nwho built the Parthenon on the site of the old Hekatompedon, which had\r\nbeen destroyed by the Persians, and Koroebus, who began to build the\r\nTemple of Initiation at Eleusis, but who only lived to see the columns\r\nerected and the architraves placed upon them. On his death, Metagenes,\r\nof Xypete, added the frieze and the upper row of columns, and Xenokles,\r\nof Cholargos, crowned it with the domed roof over the shrine. As to the\r\nlong wall, about which Sokrates says that he heard Perikles bring\r\nforward a motion, Kallikrates undertook to build it. Kratinus satirises\r\nthe work for being slowly accomplished, saying\r\n\r\n     \"He builds in speeches, but he does no work.\"\r\n\r\nThe Odeum, which internally consisted of many rows of seats and many\r\ncolumns, and externally of a roof sloping on all sides from a central\r\npoint, was said to have been built in imitation of the king of Persia's\r\ntent, and was built under Perikles's direction. For this reason Kratinus\r\nalludes to him in his play of the 'Thracian Woman'--\r\n\r\n    \"Our Jove with lofty skull appears;\r\n    The Odeum on his head he bears,\r\n    Because he fears the oyster-shell no more.\"\r\n\r\nPerikles at that period used his influence to pass a decree for\r\nestablishing a musical competition at the Panathenaic festival; and,\r\nbeing himself chosen judge, he laid down rules as to how the candidates\r\nwere to sing, and play the flute or the harp. At that period, and ever\r\nafterwards, all musical contests took place in the Odeum.\r\n\r\nThe Propylaea, before the Acropolis, were finished in five years, by\r\nMnesikles the architect; and a miraculous incident during the work\r\nseemed to show that the goddess did not disapprove, but rather\r\nencouraged and assisted the building. The most energetic and active of\r\nthe workmen fell from a great height, and lay in a dangerous condition,\r\ngiven over by his doctors. Perikles grieved much for him; but the\r\ngoddess appeared to him in a dream, and suggested a course of treatment\r\nby which Perikles quickly healed the workman. In consequence of this, he\r\nset up the brazen statue of Athene the Healer, near the old altar in the\r\nAcropolis. The golden statue of the goddess was made by Pheidias, and\r\nhis name appears upon the basement in the inscription. Almost everything\r\nwas in his hands, and he gave his orders to all the workmen--as we have\r\nsaid before--because of his friendship with Perikles. This led to their\r\nboth being envied and belied; for it was said that Perikles, with the\r\nconnivance of Pheidias, carried on intrigues with Athenian ladies, who\r\ncame ostensibly to see the works. This accusation was taken up by the\r\ncomic poets, who charged him with great profligacy, hinting that he had\r\nan improper passion for the wife of Menippus, his friend, and a\r\nlieutenant-general in the army. Even the bird-fancying of Pyrilampes,\r\nbecause he was a friend of Perikles, was misrepresented, and he was said\r\nto give peacocks to the ladies who granted their favours to Perikles.\r\nBut, indeed, how can we wonder at satirists bringing foul accusations\r\nagainst their betters, and offering them up as victims to the spite of\r\nthe populace, when we find Stesimbrotus, of Thasos, actually inventing\r\nthat unnatural and abominable falsehood of Perikles's intrigue with his\r\nown daughter-in-law. So hard is it to discover the truth, because the\r\nhistory of past ages is rendered difficult by the lapse of time; while\r\nin contemporary history the truth is always obscured, either by private\r\nspite and hatred, or by a desire to curry favour with the chief men of\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nXIV. When the speakers of Thucydides's party complained that Perikles\r\nhad wasted the public money, and destroyed the revenue, he asked the\r\npeople in the assembly whether they thought he had spent much. When they\r\nanswered \"Very much indeed,\" he said in reply, \"Do not, then, put it\r\ndown to the public account, but to mine; and I will inscribe my name\r\nupon all the public buildings.\" When Perikles said this, the people,\r\neither in admiration of his magnificence of manner, or being eager to\r\nbear their share in the glory of the new buildings, shouted to him with\r\none accord to take what money he pleased from the treasury, and spend it\r\nas he pleased, without stint. And finally, he underwent the trial of\r\nostracism with Thucydides, and not only succeeded in driving him into\r\nexile, but broke up his party.\r\n\r\nXV. As now there was no opposition to encounter in the city, and all\r\nparties had been blended into one, Perikles undertook the sole\r\nadministration of the home and foreign affairs of Athens, dealing with\r\nthe public revenue, the army, the navy, the islands and maritime\r\naffairs, and the great sources of strength which Athens derived from her\r\nalliances, as well with Greek as with foreign princes and states.\r\nHenceforth he became quite a different man: he no longer gave way to the\r\npeople, and ceased to watch the breath of popular favour; but he changed\r\nthe loose and licentious democracy, which had hitherto existed, into a\r\nstricter aristocratic, or rather monarchical, form of government. This\r\nhe used honourably and unswervingly for the public benefit, finding the\r\npeople, as a rule, willing to second the measures which he explained to\r\nthem to be necessary, and to which he asked their consent, but\r\noccasionally having to use violence, and to force them, much against\r\ntheir will, to do what was expedient; like a physician dealing with some\r\ncomplicated disorder, who at one time allows his patient innocent\r\nrecreation, and at another inflicts upon him sharp pains and bitter,\r\nthough salutary, draughts. Every possible kind of disorder was to be\r\nfound among a people possessing so great an empire as the Athenians; and\r\nhe alone was able to bring them into harmony, by playing alternately\r\nupon their hopes and fears, checking them when over-confident, and\r\nraising their spirits when they were cast down and disheartened. Thus,\r\nas Plato says, he was able to prove that oratory is the art of\r\ninfluencing men's minds, and to use it in its highest application, when\r\nit deals with men's passions and characters, which, like certain strings\r\nof a musical instrument, require a skilful and delicate touch. The\r\nsecret of his power is to be found, however, as Thucydides says, not so\r\nmuch in his mere oratory, as in his pure and blameless life, because he\r\nwas so well known to be incorruptible, and indifferent to money; for\r\nthough he made the city, which was a great one, into the greatest and\r\nrichest city of Greece, and though he himself became more powerful than\r\nmany independent sovereigns, who were able to leave their kingdoms to\r\ntheir sons, yet Perikles did not increase by one single drachma the\r\nestate which he received from his father.\r\n\r\nXVI. This is the clear account of his power which is given by Thucydides\r\nthe historian; though the comic poets misrepresent him atrociously,\r\ncalling his immediate followers the New Peisistratidae, and calling upon\r\nhim to swear that he never would make himself despot, as though his\r\npre-eminence was not to be borne in a free state. And Telekleides says,\r\nthat the Athenians delivered up into his hands\r\n\r\n    \"The tribute from the towns, the towns themselves,\r\n    The city walls, to build or to destroy,\r\n    The right of making either peace or war,\r\n    And all the wealth and produce of the land.\"\r\n\r\nAnd all this was not on any special occasion, or when his administration\r\nwas especially popular, but for forty years he held the first place\r\namong such men as Ephialtes, Leokrates, Myronides, Kimon, Tolmides, and\r\nThucydides; and, after the fall and banishment of Thucydides by\r\nostracism, he united in himself for five-and-twenty years all the\r\nvarious offices of state, which were supposed to last only for one year;\r\nand yet during the whole of that period proved himself incorruptible by\r\nbribes. As to his paternal estate, he was loth to lose it, and still\r\nmore to be troubled with the management of it; consequently, he adopted\r\nwhat seemed to him the simplest and most exact method of dealing with\r\nit. Every year's produce was sold all together, and with the money thus\r\nobtained, he would buy what was necessary for his household in the\r\nmarket, and thus regulate his expenditure. This did not make him\r\npopular with his sons when they grew up; nor yet did the women of his\r\nfamily think him a liberal manager, but blamed his exact regulation of\r\nhis daily expenses, which allowed none of the superfluities common in\r\ngreat and wealthy households, but which made the debit and credit\r\nexactly balance each other. One servant, Euangelos, kept all his\r\naccounts, as no one else had either capacity or education enough to be\r\nable to do so. These proceedings differed greatly from those of\r\nAnaxagoras the philosopher, who left his house, and let his estate go to\r\nruin, while he pursued his lofty speculations. I conceive, however, that\r\nthe life of a philosopher and that of a practical politician are not the\r\nsame, as the one directs his thoughts to abstract ideas, while the other\r\ndevotes his genius to supplying the real wants of mankind, and in some\r\ncases finds wealth not only necessary, but most valuable to him, as\r\nindeed it was to Perikles, who assisted many of the poorer citizens. It\r\nis said that, as Perikles was engaged in public affairs, Anaxagoras, who\r\nwas now an old man and in want, covered his head with his robe, and\r\ndetermined to starve himself to death; but when Perikles heard of this,\r\nhe at once ran to him, and besought him to live, lamenting, not\r\nAnaxagoras's fate, but his own, if he should lose so valuable a\r\npolitical adviser. Then Anaxagoras uncovered his head, and said to him,\r\n\"Perikles, those who want to use a lamp supply it with oil.\"\r\n\r\nXVII. As the Lacedaemonians began to be jealous of the prosperity of the\r\nAthenians, Perikles, wishing to raise the spirit of the people and to\r\nmake them feel capable of immense operations, passed a decree, inviting\r\nall the Greeks, whether inhabiting Europe or Asia, whether living in\r\nlarge cities or small ones, to send representatives to a meeting at\r\nAthens to deliberate about the restoration of the Greek temples which\r\nhad been burned by the barbarians, about the sacrifices which were due\r\nin consequence of the vows which they had made to the gods on behalf of\r\nGreece before joining battle, and about the sea, that all men might be\r\nable to sail upon it in peace and without fear. To carry out this decree\r\ntwenty men, selected from the citizens over fifty years of age, were\r\nsent out, five of whom invited the Ionian and Dorian Greeks in Asia and\r\nthe islands as far as Lesbos and Rhodes, five went to the inhabitants of\r\nthe Hellespont and Thrace as far as Byzantium, and five more proceeded\r\nto Boeotia, Phokis, and Peloponnesus, passing from thence through Lokris\r\nto the neighbouring continent as far as Akarnania and Ambrakia; while\r\nthe remainder journeyed through Euboea to the Oetaeans and the Malian\r\ngulf, and to the Achaeans of Phthia and the Thessalians, urging them to\r\njoin the assembly and take part in the deliberations concerning the\r\npeace and well-being of Greece. However, nothing was effected, and the\r\ncities never assembled, in consequence it is said of the covert\r\nhostility of the Lacedaemonians, and because the attempt was first made\r\nin Peloponnesus and failed there: yet I have inserted an account of it\r\nin order to show the lofty spirit and the magnificent designs of\r\nPerikles.\r\n\r\nXVIII. In his campaigns he was chiefly remarkable for caution, for he\r\nwould not, if he could help it, begin a battle of which the issue was\r\ndoubtful; nor did he wish to emulate those generals who have won\r\nthemselves a great reputation by running risks, and trusting to good\r\nluck. But he ever used to say to his countrymen, that none of them\r\nshould come by their deaths through any act of his. Observing that\r\nTolmides, the son of Tolmaeus, elated by previous successes and by the\r\ncredit which he had gained as a general, was about to invade Boeotia in\r\na reckless manner, and had persuaded a thousand young men to follow him\r\nwithout any support whatever, he endeavoured to stop him, and made that\r\nmemorable saying in the public assembly, that if Tolmides would not take\r\nthe advice of Perikles, he would at any rate do well to consult that\r\nbest of advisers, Time. This speech had but little success at the time;\r\nbut when, a few days afterwards, the news came that Tolmides had fallen\r\nin action at Koronea, and many noble citizens with him, Perikles was\r\ngreatly respected and admired as a wise and patriotic man.\r\n\r\nXIX. His most successful campaign was that in the Chersonesus, which\r\nproved the salvation of the Greeks residing there: for he not only\r\nsettled a thousand colonists there, and thus increased the available\r\nforce of the cities, but built a continuous line of fortifications\r\nreaching across the isthmus from one sea to the other, by which he shut\r\noff the Thracians, who had previously ravaged the peninsula, and put an\r\nend to a constant and harassing border warfare to which the settlers\r\nwere exposed, as they had for neighbours tribes of wild plundering\r\nbarbarians.\r\n\r\nBut that by which he obtained most glory and renown was when he started\r\nfrom Pegae, in the Megarian territory, and sailed round the Peloponnesus\r\nwith a fleet of a hundred triremes; for he not only laid waste much of\r\nthe country near the coast, as Tolmides had previously done, but he\r\nproceeded far inland, away from his ships, leading the troops who were\r\non board, and terrified the inhabitants so much that they shut\r\nthemselves up in their strongholds. The men of Sikyon alone ventured to\r\nmeet him at Nemea, and them he overthrew in a pitched battle, and\r\nerected a trophy. Next he took on board troops from the friendly\r\ndistrict of Achaia, and, crossing over to the opposite side of the\r\nCorinthian Gulf, coasted along past the mouth of the river Achelous,\r\noverran Akarnania, drove the people of Oeneadae to the shelter of their\r\ncity walls, and after ravaging the country returned home, having made\r\nhimself a terror to his enemies, and done good service to Athens; for\r\nnot the least casualty, even by accident, befel the troops under his\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nXX. When he sailed into the Black Sea with a great and splendidly\r\nequipped fleet, he assisted the Greek cities there, and treated them\r\nwith consideration; and showed the neighbouring savage tribes and their\r\nchiefs the greatness of his force, and his confidence in his power, by\r\nsailing where he pleased, and taking complete control over that sea. He\r\nleft at Sinope thirteen ships, and a land force under the command of\r\nLamachus, to act against Timesileon, who had made himself despot of that\r\ncity. When he and his party were driven out, Perikles passed a decree\r\nthat six hundred Athenian volunteers should sail to Sinope, and become\r\ncitizens there, receiving the houses and lands which had formerly been\r\nin the possession of the despot and his party. But in other cases he\r\nwould not agree to the impulsive proposals of the Athenians, and he\r\nopposed them when, elated by their power and good fortune, they talked\r\nof recovering Egypt and attacking the seaboard of the Persian empire.\r\nMany, too, were inflamed with that ill-starred notion of an attempt on\r\nSicily, which was afterwards blown into a flame by Alkibiades and other\r\norators. Some even dreamed of the conquest of Etruria and Carthage, in\r\nconsequence of the greatness which the Athenian empire had already\r\nreached, and the full tide of success which seemed to attend it.\r\n\r\nXXI. Perikles, however, restrained these outbursts, and would not allow\r\nthe people to meddle with foreign states, but used the power of Athens\r\nchiefly to preserve and guard her already existing empire, thinking it\r\nto be of paramount importance to oppose the Lacedaemonians, a task to\r\nwhich he bent all his energies, as is proved by many of his acts,\r\nespecially in connection with the Sacred War. In this war the\r\nLacedaemonians sent a force to Delphi, and made the Phokaeans, who held\r\nit, give it up to the people of Delphi: but as soon as they were gone\r\nPerikles made an expedition into the country, and restored the temple to\r\nthe Phokaeans; and as the Lacedaemonians had scratched the oracle which\r\nthe Delphians had given them, on the forehead of the brazen wolf there,\r\nPerikles got a response from the oracle for the Athenians, and carved it\r\non the right side of the same wolf.\r\n\r\nXXII. Events proved that Perikles was right in confining the Athenian\r\nempire to Greece. First of all Euboea revolted, and he was obliged to\r\nlead an army to subdue that island. Shortly after this, news came that\r\nthe Megarians had become hostile, and that an army, under the command of\r\nPleistoanax, king of the Lacedaemonians, was menacing the frontier of\r\nAttica. Perikles now in all haste withdrew his troops from Euboea, to\r\nmeet the invader. He did not venture on an engagement with the numerous\r\nand warlike forces of the enemy, although repeatedly invited by them to\r\nfight: but, observing that Pleistoanax was a very young man, and\r\nentirely under the influence of Kleandrides, whom the Ephors had sent to\r\nact as his tutor and counsellor because of his tender years, he opened\r\nsecret negotiations with the latter, who at once, for a bribe, agreed to\r\nwithdraw the Peloponnesians from Attica. When their army returned and\r\ndispersed, the Lacedaemonians were so incensed that they imposed a fine\r\non their king, and condemned Kleandrides, who fled the country, to be\r\nput to death. This Kleandrides was the father of Gylippus, who caused\r\nthe ruin of the Athenian expedition in Sicily. Avarice seems to have\r\nbeen hereditary in the family, for Gylippus himself, after brilliant\r\nexploits in war, was convicted of taking bribes, and banished from\r\nSparta in disgrace. This is more fully set forth in the Life of\r\nLysander.\r\n\r\nXXIII. When Perikles submitted the accounts of the campaign to the\r\npeople, there was an item of ten talents, \"for a necessary purpose,\"\r\nwhich the people passed without any questioning, or any curiosity to\r\nlearn the secret. Some historians, amongst whom is Theophrastus the\r\nphilosopher, say that Perikles sent ten talents annually to Sparta, by\r\nmeans of which he bribed the chief magistrates to defer the war, thus\r\nnot buying peace, but time to make preparations for a better defence. He\r\nimmediately turned his attention to the insurgents in Euboea, and\r\nproceeding thither with a fleet of fifty sail, and five thousand heavy\r\narmed troops, he reduced their cities to submission. He banished from\r\nChalkis the \"equestrian order,\" as it was called, consisting of men of\r\nwealth and station; and he drove all the inhabitants of Hestiaea out of\r\ntheir country, replacing them by Athenian settlers.\r\n\r\nHe treated these people with this pitiless severity, because they had\r\ncaptured an Athenian ship, and put its crew to the sword.\r\n\r\nXXIV. After this, as the Athenians and Lacedaemonians made a truce for\r\nthirty years, Perikles decreed the expedition against Samos, on the\r\npretext that they had disregarded the commands of the Athenians, to\r\ncease from their war with the Milesians. It was thought that he began\r\nthis war with the Samians to please Aspasia, and this is, therefore, a\r\ngood opportunity to discuss that person's character, and how she\r\npossessed so great influence and ability that the leading politicians of\r\nthe day were at her feet, while philosophers discussed and admired her\r\ndiscourse. It is agreed that she was of Milesian origin, and that her\r\nfather's name was Axiochus; and she is said to have reserved her favours\r\nfor the most powerful personages in Greece, in imitation of Thargelia,\r\nan Ionian lady of ancient times, of great beauty, ability, and\r\nattractions, who had many lovers among the Greeks, and brought them all\r\nover to the Persian interest, by which means the seeds of the Persian\r\nfaction were sown in many cities of Greece, as they were all men of\r\ngreat influence and position.\r\n\r\nNow some writers say that Perikles valued Aspasia only for her wisdom\r\nand political ability. Indeed Sokrates and his friends used to frequent\r\nher society; and those who listened to her discourse used to bring their\r\nwives with them, that they too might profit by it, although her\r\nprofession was far from being honourable or decent, for she kept\r\ncourtesans in her house. Aeschines says that Lysikles, the sheep dealer,\r\na low-born and low-minded man, became one of the first men in Athens,\r\nbecause he lived with Aspasia after Perikles's death. In Plato's\r\ndialogue too, called 'Menexenus,' though the first part is written in a\r\nhumorous style, yet there is in it thus much of serious truth, that she\r\nwas thought to discuss questions of rhetoric with many Athenians. But\r\nPerikles seems to have been more enamoured of Aspasia's person than her\r\nintellect. He was married to a woman who was nearly related to him, who\r\nhad previously been the wife of Hipponikus, by whom she became the\r\nmother of Kallias the rich. By her Perikles had two sons, Xanthippus and\r\nParalus; but afterwards, as they could not live comfortably together,\r\nhe, at his wife's wish, handed her over to another husband, and himself\r\nlived with Aspasia, of whom he was passionately fond. It is said that he\r\nnever went in or out of his house during the day without kissing her. In\r\nthe comedies of the time, she is spoken of as the new Omphale and as\r\nDeianeira, and sometimes as Hera (Juno). Kratinus plainly speaks of her\r\nas a harlot in the following lines:\r\n\r\n    \"To him Vice bore a Juno new,\r\n    Aspasia, shameless harlot.\"\r\n\r\nHe is thought to have had a bastard son by her, who is mentioned by\r\nEupolis in his play of 'The Townships,' where Perikles is introduced,\r\nasking, \"Lives then my son?\" to which Myronides answers:\r\n\r\n    \"He lives, and long had claimed a manly name,\r\n    But that he feared his harlot mother's shame.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said that Aspasia became so illustrious and well known that the\r\nCyrus who fought with his brother for the empire of Persia, called his\r\nfavourite concubine Aspasia, though she had before been named Milto. She\r\nwas a Phokaean by birth, the daughter of Hermotimus. After the death of\r\nCyrus in battle, she was taken into the king's harem, and acquired great\r\ninfluence with him. These particulars about Aspasia occurred to my\r\nmemory, and I thought that perhaps I might please my readers by relating\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nXXV. Perikles is accused of going to war with Samos to save the\r\nMilesians, at the request of Aspasia. These States were at war about the\r\npossession of the city of Priéne, and the Samians, who were victorious,\r\nwould not lay down their arms and allow the Athenians to settle the\r\nmatter by arbitration, as they ordered them to do. For this reason\r\nPerikles proceeded to Samos, put an end to the oligarchical form of\r\ngovernment there, and sent fifty hostages and as many children to\r\nLemnos, to ensure the good behaviour of the leading men. It is said that\r\neach of these hostages offered him a talent for his own freedom, and\r\nthat much more was offered by that party which was loth to see a\r\ndemocracy established in the city. Besides all this, Pissuthnes the\r\nPersian, who had a liking for the Samians, sent and offered him ten\r\nthousand pieces of gold if he would spare the city. Perikles, however,\r\ntook none of these bribes, but dealt with Samos as he had previously\r\ndetermined, and returned to Athens. The Samians now at once revolted, as\r\nPissuthnes managed to get them back their hostages, and furnished them\r\nwith the means of carrying on the war. Perikles now made a second\r\nexpedition against them, and found them in no mind to submit quietly,\r\nbut determined to dispute the empire of the seas with the Athenians.\r\nPerikles gained a signal victory over them in a sea-fight off the Goats'\r\nIsland, beating a fleet of seventy ships with only forty-four, twenty of\r\nwhich were transports.\r\n\r\nXXVI. Simultaneously with his victory and the flight of the enemy he\r\nobtained command of the harbour of Samos, and besieged the Samians in\r\ntheir city. They, in spite of their defeat, still possessed courage\r\nenough to sally out and fight a battle under the walls; but soon a\r\nlarger force arrived from Athens, and the Samians were completely\r\nblockaded.\r\n\r\nPerikles now with sixty ships sailed out of the Archipelago into the\r\nMediterranean, according to the most current report intending to meet\r\nthe Phoenician fleet which was coming to help the Samians, but,\r\naccording to Stesimbrotus, with the intention of attacking Cyprus, which\r\nseems improbable. Whatever his intention may have been, his expedition\r\nwas a failure, for Melissus, the son of Ithagenes, a man of culture, who\r\nwas then in command of the Samian forces, conceiving a contempt for the\r\nsmall force of the Athenians and the want of experience of their leaders\r\nafter Perikles's departure, persuaded his countrymen to attack them. In\r\nthe battle the Samians proved victorious, taking many Athenians\r\nprisoners, and destroying many of their ships. By this victory they\r\nobtained command of the sea, and were able to supply themselves with\r\nmore warlike stores than they had possessed before. Aristotle even says\r\nthat Perikles himself was before this beaten by Melissus in a sea-fight.\r\nThe Samians branded the figure of an owl on the foreheads of their\r\nAthenian prisoners, to revenge themselves for the branding of their own\r\nprisoners by the Athenians with the figure of a _samaina_. This is a\r\nship having a beak turned up like a swine's snout, but with a roomy\r\nhull, so as both to carry a large cargo and sail fast. This class of\r\nvessel is called _samaina_ because it was first built at Samos by\r\nPolykrates, the despot of that island. It is said that the verse of\r\nAristophanes,\r\n\r\n    \"The Samians are a deeply lettered race,\"\r\n\r\nalludes to this branding.\r\n\r\nXXVII. When Perikles heard of the disaster which had befallen his army,\r\nhe returned in all haste to assist them. He beat Melissus, who came out\r\nto meet him, and, after putting the enemy to rout, at once built a wall\r\nround their city, preferring to reduce it by blockade to risking the\r\nlives of his countrymen in an assault. As time went on the Athenians\r\nbecame impatient and eager to fight, and it was hard to restrain their\r\nardour. Perikles divided the whole force into eight divisions, and made\r\nthem all draw lots. The division which drew the white bean he permitted\r\nto feast and take their ease, while the rest did their duty. For this\r\nreason those who are enjoying themselves call it a \"white day,\" in\r\nallusion to the white bean. Ephorus tells us that Perikles made use of\r\nbattering engines in this siege, being attracted by their novelty, and\r\nthat Artemon the mechanician was present, who was surnamed Periphoretus\r\nbecause he was lame, and carried in a litter to see such of the works as\r\nrequired his superintendence. This story is proved to be false by\r\nHerakleides of Pontus, he quoting Anakreon's poems, in which Artemon\r\nPeriphoretus is mentioned many generations before the revolt and siege\r\nof Samos. He tells us that Artemon was an effeminate coward who spent\r\nmost of his time indoors, with two slaves holding a brazen shield over\r\nhis head for fear that anything should fall upon it, and if he was\r\nobliged to go out, used to be carried in a hammock slung so low as\r\nalmost to touch the ground, from which he received the name of\r\nPeriphoretus.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. In the ninth month of the siege the Samians surrendered.\r\nPerikles demolished their walls, confiscated their fleet, and imposed a\r\nheavy fine upon them, some part of which was paid at once by the\r\nSamians, who gave hostages for the payment of the remainder at fixed\r\nperiods. Douris, of Samos, makes a lamentable story of this, accusing\r\nPerikles and the Athenians of great cruelty, no mention of which is to\r\nbe found in Thucydides, Ephorus, or Aristotle. He obviously does not\r\ntell the truth when he says that Perikles took the captains and marine\r\nsoldiers of each ship to the market-place at Miletus, bound them to\r\nplanks, and after they had been so for ten days and were in a miserable\r\nstate, knocked them on the head with clubs and cast out their bodies\r\nwithout burial. But Douris, even in cases where he has no personal bias,\r\nprefers writing an exciting story to keeping to the exact truth, and in\r\nthis instance probably exaggerated the sufferings of his countrymen in\r\norder to gratify his dislike of the Athenians.\r\n\r\nPerikles, after the reduction of Samos, returned to Athens, where he\r\nburied those who had fallen in the war in a magnificent manner, and was\r\nmuch admired for the funeral oration which, as is customary, was spoken\r\nby him over the graves of his countrymen. When he descended from the\r\nrostrum the women greeted him, crowning him with garlands and ribbons\r\nlike a victorious athlete, and Elpinike drawing near to him said, \"A\r\nfine exploit, truly, Perikles, and well worthy of a crown, to lose many\r\nof our brave fellow-citizens, not fighting with Persians or Phoenicians,\r\nas my brother Kimon did, but in ruining a city of men of our own blood\r\nand our own allies.\" At these words of Elpinike, Perikles merely smiled\r\nand repeated the verse of Archilochus--\r\n\r\n    \"Too old thou art for rich perfumes.\"\r\n\r\nIon says that his victory over the Samians wonderfully flattered his\r\nvanity. Agamemnon, he was wont to say, took ten years to take a\r\nbarbarian city, but he in nine months had made himself master of the\r\nfirst and most powerful city in Ionia. And the comparison was not an\r\nunjust one, for truly the war was a very great undertaking, and its\r\nissue quite uncertain, since, as Thucydides tells us, the Samians came\r\nvery near to wresting the empire of the sea from the Athenians.\r\n\r\nXXIX. After these events, as the clouds were gathering for the\r\nPeloponnesian war, Perikles persuaded the Athenians to send assistance\r\nto the people of Korkyra, who were at war with the Corinthians, and thus\r\nto attach to their own side an island with a powerful naval force, at a\r\nmoment when the Peloponnesians had all but declared war against them.\r\n\r\nWhen the people passed this decree, Perikles sent only ten ships under\r\nthe command of Lacedaemonius, the son of Kimon, as if he designed a\r\ndeliberate insult; for the house of Kimon was on peculiarly friendly\r\nterms with the Lacedaemonians. His design in sending Lacedaemonius out,\r\nagainst his will, and with so few ships, was that if he performed\r\nnothing brilliant he might be accused, even more than he was already, of\r\nleaning to the side of the Spartans. Indeed, by all means in his power,\r\nhe always threw obstacles in the way of the advancement of Kimon's\r\nfamily, representing that by their very names they were aliens, one son\r\nbeing named Lacedaemonius, another Thessalus, another Eleius. Moreover,\r\nthe mother of all three was an Arcadian.\r\n\r\nNow Perikles was much reproached for sending these ten ships, which\r\nwere of little value to the Korkyreans, and gave a great handle to his\r\nenemies to use against him, and in consequence sent a larger force after\r\nthem to Korkyra, which arrived there after the battle. The Corinthians,\r\nenraged at this, complained in the congress of Sparta of the conduct of\r\nthe Athenians, as did also the Megarians, who said that they were\r\nexcluded from every market and every harbour which was in Athenian\r\nhands, contrary to the ancient rights and common privileges of the\r\nHellenic race. The people of Aegina also considered themselves to be\r\noppressed and ill-treated, and secretly bemoaned their grievances in the\r\nears of the Spartans, for they dared not openly bring any charges\r\nagainst the Athenians. At this time, too, Potidaea, a city subject to\r\nAthens, but a colony of Corinth, revolted, and its siege materially\r\nhastened the outbreak of the war. Archidamus, indeed, the king of the\r\nLacedaemonians, sent ambassadors to Athens, was willing to submit all\r\ndisputed points to arbitration, and endeavoured to moderate the\r\nexcitement of his allies, so that war probably would not have broken out\r\nif the Athenians could have been persuaded to rescind their decree of\r\nexclusion against the Megarians, and to come to terms with them. And,\r\nfor this reason, Perikles, who was particularly opposed to this, and\r\nurged the people not to give way to the Megarians, alone bore the blame\r\nof having begun the war.\r\n\r\nXXX. It is said, that when an embassy arrived at Athens from Lacedaemon\r\nto treat upon these matters, Perikles argued that there was a law which\r\nforbade the tablet, on which the decree against the Megarians was\r\nwritten, to be taken down. \"Then,\" said Polyalkes, one of the\r\nambassadors, \"do not take it down, but turn it with its face to the\r\nwall; for there is no law against that!\"\r\n\r\nClever as this retort was, it had no effect on Perikles. He had, it\r\nseems, some private spite at the Megarians, though the ground of quarrel\r\nwhich he put publicly forward was that the Megarians had applied to\r\ntheir own use some of the sacred ground; and he passed a decree for a\r\nherald to be sent to the Megarians, and then to go on to the\r\nLacedaemonians to complain of their conduct. This decree of Perikles is\r\nworded in a candid and reasonable manner; but the herald,\r\nAnthemokritus, was thought to have met his death at the hands of the\r\nMegarians, and Charinus passed a decree to the effect that Athens should\r\nwage war against them to the death, without truce or armistice; that any\r\nMegarian found in Attica should be punished with death, and that the\r\ngenerals, when taking the usual oath for each year, should swear in\r\naddition that they would invade the Megarian territory twice every year;\r\nand that Anthemokritus should be buried near the city gate leading into\r\nthe Thriasian plain, which is now called the Double Gate.\r\n\r\nNow, the Megarians say that they were not to blame for the murder of\r\nAnthemokritus, and lay it upon Perikles and Aspasia, quoting the\r\nhackneyed rhymes from the 'Acharnians,' of Aristophanes:\r\n\r\n    \"Some young Athenians in their drunken play,\r\n    From Megara Simaetha stole away,\r\n    The men of Megara next, with angered soul,\r\n    Two of Aspasia's choicest harlots stole.\"\r\n\r\nXXXI. How the dispute originated it is hard to say, but all writers\r\nagree in throwing on Perikles the blame of refusing to reverse the\r\ndecree. Some attribute his firmness to a wise calculation, saying that\r\nthe demand was merely made in order to try him, and that any concessions\r\nwould have been regarded as a sign of weakness; while others say that he\r\ntreated the Lacedaemonians so cavalierly through pride and a desire to\r\nshow his own strength. But the worst motive of all, and that to which\r\nmost men attribute his conduct, was as follows: Pheidias, the sculptor,\r\nwas, as we have related, entrusted with the task of producing the statue\r\nof the tutelary goddess of Athens. His intimacy with Perikles, with whom\r\nhe had great influence, gained for him many enemies, who, wishing to\r\nexperiment on the temper of the people towards Perikles himself, bribed\r\nMenon, one of Pheidias's fellow-workmen, to seat himself in the\r\nmarket-place as a suppliant who begged that he might receive protection\r\nwhile he denounced and prosecuted Pheidias. The people took this man\r\nunder its protection, and Pheidias was prosecuted before the Senate. The\r\nalleged charges of theft were not proved, for Pheidias, by the advice of\r\nPerikles, had originally fashioned the golden part of the statue in\r\nsuch a manner that it could all be taken off and weighed, and this\r\nPerikles bade the prosecutor do on this occasion. But the glory which\r\nPheidias obtained by the reality of his work made him an object of envy\r\nand hatred, especially when in his sculpture of the battle with the\r\nAmazons on the shield of the goddess he introduced his own portrait as a\r\nbald-headed old man lifting a great stone with both hands, and also a\r\nvery fine representation of Perikles, fighting with an Amazon. The\r\nposition of the hand, which was holding a spear before the face of\r\nPerikles, was ingeniously devised as if to conceal the portrait, which,\r\nnevertheless, could plainly be seen on either side of it. For this,\r\nPheidias was imprisoned, and there fell sick and died, though some say\r\nthat his enemies poisoned him in order to cast suspicion upon Perikles.\r\nAt the instance of Glykon, the people voted to Menon, the informer, an\r\nimmunity from public burdens, and ordered the generals of the State to\r\nprovide for the wretch's safety.\r\n\r\nXXXII. About the same time Aspasia was prosecuted for impiety, at the\r\nsuit of Hermippus, the comic playwright, who moreover accused her of\r\nharbouring free-born Athenian ladies, with whom Perikles carried on\r\nintrigues. Also Diopeithes proposed a decree, that prosecutions should\r\nbe instituted against all persons who disbelieved in religion, and held\r\ntheories of their own about heavenly phenomena. This was aimed at\r\nPerikles through the philosopher Anaxagoras. As the people adopted this\r\ndecree, and eagerly listened to these slanderous accusations, another\r\ndecree was carried by Drakontides, that Perikles should lay the accounts\r\nof his dealings with the public revenue before the Prytanes, and that\r\nthe judges should carry their suffrage from the altar in the Acropolis,\r\nand go and determine the cause in the city. At the motion of Hagnon this\r\npart of the decree was reversed, but he succeeded in having the action\r\nconducted before fifteen hundred judges, in a form of trial which one\r\nmight call either one for theft, or taking of bribes, or for public\r\nwrong-doing. Aspasia was acquitted, quite contrary to justice, according\r\nto Aeschines, because Perikles shed tears and made a personal appeal to\r\nthe judges on her behalf. He feared that Anaxagoras would be convicted,\r\nand sent him out of the city before his trial commenced. And now, as he\r\nhad become unpopular by means of Pheidias, he at once blew the war into\r\na flame, hoping to put an end to these prosecutions, and to restore his\r\nown personal ascendancy by involving the State in important and\r\ndangerous crises, in which it would have to rely for guidance upon\r\nhimself alone.\r\n\r\nThese are the causes which are assigned for his refusal to permit the\r\nAthenians to make any concession to the Lacedaemonians, but the real\r\nhistory of the transaction will never be known.\r\n\r\nXXXIII. Now, as the Lacedaemonians knew that if he could be removed from\r\npower they would find the Athenians much more easy to deal with, they\r\nbade them, \"drive forth the accursed thing,\" alluding to Perikles's\r\ndescent from the Alkmaeonidae by his mother's side, as we are told by\r\nThucydides the historian. But this attempt had just the contrary effect\r\nto that which they intended; for, instead of suspicion and dislike,\r\nPerikles met with much greater honour and respect from his countrymen\r\nthan before, because they saw that he was an object of especial dislike\r\nto the enemy. For this reason, before the Peloponnesians, under\r\nArchidamus, invaded Attica, he warned the Athenians that if Archidamus,\r\nwhen he laid waste everything else, spared his own private estate\r\nbecause of the friendly private relations existing between them, or in\r\norder to give his personal enemies a ground for impeaching him, that he\r\nshould give both the land and the farm buildings upon it to the State.\r\n\r\nThe Lacedaemonians invaded Attica with a great host of their own troops\r\nand those of their allies, led by Archidamus, their king. They\r\nproceeded, ravaging the country as they went, as far as Acharnae (close\r\nto Athens), where they encamped, imagining that the Athenians would\r\nnever endure to see them there, but would be driven by pride and shame\r\nto come out and fight them. However, Perikles thought that it would be a\r\nvery serious matter to fight for the very existence of Athens against\r\nsixty thousand Peloponnesian and Boeotian[A] heavy-armed troops, and so\r\nhe pacified those who were dissatisfied at his inactivity by pointing\r\nout that trees when cut down quickly grow again, but that when the men\r\nof a State are lost, it is hard to raise up others to take their place.\r\nHe would not call an assembly of the people, because he feared that they\r\nwould force him to act against his better judgment, but, just as the\r\ncaptain of a ship, when a storm comes on at sea, places everything in\r\nthe best trim to meet it, and trusting to his own skill and seamanship,\r\ndisregarding the tears and entreaties of the sea-sick and terrified\r\npassengers; so did Perikles shut the gates of Athens, place sufficient\r\nforces to ensure the safety of the city at all points, and calmly carry\r\nout his own policy, taking little heed of the noisy grumblings of the\r\ndiscontented. Many of his friends besought him to attack, many of his\r\nenemies threatened him and abused him, and many songs and offensive\r\njests were written about him, speaking of him as a coward, and one who\r\nwas betraying the city to its enemies. Kleon too attacked him, using the\r\nanger which the citizens felt against him to advance his own personal\r\npopularity, as we see from the following lines of Hermippus:\r\n\r\n    \"King of Satyrs, wherefore fear you\r\n    Spear to wield, and only dare to\r\n    Talk in swelling phrase, while yet you\r\n                     Cower, Teles like,\r\n    And when goaded on, past bearing,\r\n    By our Kleon's tongue so daring,\r\n    Only gnash your teeth despairing,\r\n                     Still afraid to strike.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The Dorians of Boeotia and Peloponnesus were accounted the\r\nbest infantry soldiers of Greece.]\r\n\r\nXXXIV. Perikles was unmoved by any of these attacks, but quietly endured\r\nall this storm of obloquy. He sent a fleet of a hundred ships to attack\r\nPeloponnesus, but did not sail with it himself, remaining at home to\r\nkeep a tight hand over Athens until the Peloponnesians drew off their\r\nforces. He regained his popularity with the common people, who suffered\r\nmuch from the war, by giving them allowances of money from the public\r\nrevenue, and grants of land; for he drove out the entire population of\r\nthe island of Aegina, and divided the land by lot among the Athenians. A\r\ncertain amount of relief also was experienced by reflecting upon the\r\ninjuries which they were inflicting on the enemy; for the fleet as it\r\nsailed round Peloponnesus destroyed many small villages and cities, and\r\nravaged a great extent of country, while Perikles himself led an\r\nexpedition into the territory of Megara and laid it all waste. By this\r\nit is clear that the allies, although they did much damage to the\r\nAthenians, yet suffered equally themselves, and never could have\r\nprotracted the war for such a length of time as it really lasted, but,\r\nas Perikles foretold, must soon have desisted had not Providence\r\ninterfered and confounded human counsels. For now the pestilence fell\r\namong the Athenians, and cut off the flower of their youth. Suffering\r\nboth in body and mind they raved against Perikles, just as people when\r\ndelirious with disease attack their fathers or their physicians. They\r\nendeavoured to ruin him, urged on by his personal enemies, who assured\r\nthem that he was the author of the plague, because he had brought all\r\nthe country people into the city, where they were compelled to live\r\nduring the heat of summer, crowded together in small rooms and stifling\r\ntents, living an idle life too, and breathing foul air instead of the\r\npure country breezes to which they were accustomed. The cause of this,\r\nthey said, was the man who, when the war began, admitted the masses of\r\nthe country people into the city, and then made no use of them, but\r\nallowed them to be penned up together like cattle, and transmit the\r\ncontagion from one to another, without devising any remedy or\r\nalleviation of their sufferings.\r\n\r\nXXXV. Hoping to relieve them somewhat, and also to annoy the enemy,\r\nPerikles manned a hundred and fifty ships, placed on board, besides the\r\nsailors, many brave infantry and cavalry soldiers, and was about to put\r\nto sea. The Athenians conceived great hopes, and the enemy no less\r\nterror from so large an armament. When all was ready, and Perikles\r\nhimself had just embarked in his own trireme, an eclipse of the sun took\r\nplace, producing total darkness, and all men were terrified at so great\r\na portent. Perikles, observing that his helmsman was alarmed and knew\r\nnot what to do, held his cloak over the man's eyes and asked him if he\r\nthought that a terrible portent. As he answered that he did not,\r\nPerikles said: \"What is the difference, then, between it and an eclipse\r\nof the sun, except that the eclipse is caused by something larger than\r\nmy cloak?\" This subject is discussed by the philosophers in their\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nPerikles sailed with the fleet, but did nothing worthy of so great a\r\nforce. He besieged the sacred city of Epidaurus, but, although he had\r\ngreat hopes of taking it, he failed on account of the plague, which\r\ndestroyed not only his own men, but every one who came in contact with\r\nthem. After this he again endeavoured to encourage the Athenians, to\r\nwhom he had become an object of dislike. However, he did not succeed in\r\npacifying them, but they condemned him by a public vote to be general no\r\nmore, and to pay a fine which is stated at the lowest estimate to have\r\nbeen fifteen talents, and at the highest fifty. This was carried,\r\naccording to Idomeneus, by Kleon, but according to Theophrastus by\r\nSimmias; whilst Herakleides of Pontus says that it was effected by\r\nLakrateides.\r\n\r\nXXXVI. He soon regained his public position, for the people's outburst\r\nof anger was quenched by the blow they had dealt him, just as a bee\r\nleaves its sting in the wound; but his private affairs were in great\r\ndistress and disorder, as he had lost many of his relatives during the\r\nplague, while others were estranged from him on political grounds.\r\nXanthippus too, the eldest of his legitimate sons, who was a spendthrift\r\nby nature and married to a woman of expensive habits, a daughter of\r\nTisander, the son of Epilykus, could not bear with his father's stingy\r\nways and the small amount of money which he allowed him. He consequently\r\nsent to one of his friends and borrowed money from him as if Perikles\r\nhad authorised him to do so. When the friend asked for his money back\r\nagain, Perikles prosecuted him, at which proceeding young Xanthippus was\r\nenraged and abused his father, sneering at his way of life and his\r\ndiscussions with the sophists. When some athlete accidentally killed\r\nEpitimus of Pharsalus with a javelin, he said that Perikles spent the\r\nwhole day arguing with Protagoras whether in strict accuracy the\r\njavelin, or the man who threw it, or the stewards of the games, ought to\r\nbe considered the authors of the mishap. And, besides this, Stesimbrotus\r\ntells us that Xanthippus put about that scandal about his father and his\r\nown wife, so that the father and son remained irreconcilable enemies\r\nuntil Xanthippus's death, which happened during the plague, by an\r\nattack of that disorder. At the same time Perikles lost his sister and\r\nmost of his relations, especially those who supported his policy. Yet he\r\nwould not yield, nor abate his firmness and constancy of spirit because\r\nof these afflictions, but was not observed to weep or mourn, or attend\r\nthe funeral of any of his relations, until he lost Paralus, the last of\r\nhis legitimate offspring. Crushed by this blow, he tried in vain to keep\r\nup his grand air of indifference, and when carrying a garland to lay\r\nupon the corpse he was overpowered by his feelings, so as to burst into\r\na passion of tears and sobs, which he had never done before in his whole\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nXXXVII. Athens made trial of her other generals and public men to\r\nconduct her affairs, but none appeared to be of sufficient weight or\r\nreputation to have such a charge entrusted to him. The city longed for\r\nPerikles, and invited him again to lead its counsels and direct its\r\narmies; and he, although dejected in spirits and living in seclusion in\r\nhis own house, was yet persuaded by Alkibiades and his other friends to\r\nresume the direction of affairs. The people apologised for their\r\nungrateful treatment of him, and when he was again in office and elected\r\nas general, he begged of them to be released from the operations of the\r\nlaw of bastardy, which he himself had originally introduced, in order\r\nthat his name and race might not altogether become extinct for want of\r\nan heir. The provisions of the law were as follows:--Perikles many years\r\nbefore, when he was at the height of his power and had children born to\r\nhim, as we have related, of legitimate birth, proposed a law that only\r\nthose born of an Athenian father and mother should be reckoned Athenian\r\ncitizens. But when the king of Egypt sent a present of forty thousand\r\n_medimni_ of wheat to be divided among the citizens, many lawsuits arose\r\nabout the citizenship of men whose birth had never been questioned\r\nbefore that law came into force, and many vexatious informations were\r\nlaid. Nearly five thousand men were convicted of illegitimacy of birth\r\nand sold for slaves, while those who retained their citizenship and\r\nproved themselves to be genuine Athenians amounted to fourteen thousand\r\nand forty. It was indeed an unreasonable request that a law which had\r\nbeen enforced in so many instances should now be broken in the person of\r\nits own author, but Perikles's domestic misfortunes, in which he seemed\r\nto have paid the penalty for his former haughtiness and pride, touched\r\nthe hearts of the Athenians so much that they thought his sorrows\r\ndeserving of their pity, and his request such as he was entitled to make\r\nand they to grant in common charity, and they consented to his\r\nillegitimate son being enrolled in his own tribe and bearing his own\r\nname. This man was subsequently put to death by the people, together\r\nwith all his colleagues, for their conduct after the sea-fight at\r\nArginusae.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. After this it appears that Perikles was attacked by the plague,\r\nnot acutely or continuously, as in most cases, but in a slow wasting\r\nfashion, exhibiting many varieties of symptoms, and gradually\r\nundermining his strength. Theophrastus, in his treatise on Ethics,\r\ndiscusses whether a man's character can be changed by disease, and\r\nwhether virtue depends upon bodily health. As an example, he quotes a\r\nstory that Perikles, when one of his friends came to visit him during\r\nhis sickness, showed him a charm hung round his neck, as a proof that he\r\nmust be indeed ill to submit to such a piece of folly. As he was now on\r\nhis deathbed, the most distinguished of the citizens and his surviving\r\nfriends collected round him and spoke admiringly of his nobleness and\r\nimmense power, enumerating also the number of his exploits, and the\r\ntrophies which he had set up for victories gained; for while in chief\r\ncommand he had won no less than nine victories for Athens. They were\r\ntalking thus to one another in his presence, imagining that he could no\r\nlonger understand them, but had lost his power of attending to them. He,\r\nhowever, was following all that they said, and suddenly broke silence,\r\nsaying that he was surprised at their remembering and praising him for\r\nthe exploits which depended entirely upon fortune for their success, and\r\nwhich many other generals had done as well as himself, while they did\r\nnot mention his greatest and most glorious title to fame. \"No Athenian,\"\r\nsaid he, \"ever wore black because of me.\"\r\n\r\nXXXIX. Perikles was to be admired, not only for his gentleness and\r\nmildness of spirit, which he preserved through the most violent\r\npolitical crises and outbreaks of personal hatred to himself, but also\r\nfor his lofty disposition. He himself accounted it his greatest virtue\r\nthat he never gave way to feelings of envy or hatred, but from his own\r\nexalted pinnacle of greatness never regarded any man as so much his\r\nenemy that he could never be his friend. This alone, in my opinion,\r\njustifies that outrageous nickname of his, and gives it a certain\r\npropriety; for so serene and impartial a man, utterly uncorrupt though\r\npossessed of great power, might naturally be called Olympian. Thus it is\r\nthat we believe that the gods, who are the authors of all good and of no\r\nevil to men, rule over us and over all created things, not as the poets\r\ndescribe them in their bewildering fashion, which their own poems prove\r\nto be untrue. The poets describe the abode of the gods as a safe and\r\nuntroubled place where no wind or clouds are, always enjoying a mild air\r\nand clear light, thinking such a place to be fittest for a life of\r\nimmortal blessedness; while they represent the gods themselves as full\r\nof disorder and anger and spite and other passions, which are not\r\nbecoming even to mortal men of common sense. Those reflections, however,\r\nperhaps belong to another subject.\r\n\r\nEvents soon made the loss of Perikles felt and regretted by the\r\nAthenians. Those who during his lifetime had complained that his power\r\ncompletely threw them into the shade, when after his death they had made\r\ntrial of other orators and statesmen, were obliged to confess that with\r\nall his arrogance no man ever was really more moderate, and that his\r\nreal mildness in dealing with men was as remarkable as his apparent\r\npride and assumption. His power, which had been so grudged and envied,\r\nand called monarchy and despotism, now was proved to have been the\r\nsaving of the State; such an amount of corrupt dealing and wickedness\r\nsuddenly broke out in public affairs, which he before had crushed and\r\nforced to hide itself, and so prevented its becoming incurable through\r\nimpunity and licence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF FABIUS MAXIMUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Such a man did Perikles show himself to be in his most memorable\r\nacts, as far as they are extant.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn our attention to Fabius.\r\n\r\nThe first of the family is said to descend from one of the nymphs,\r\naccording to some writers, according to others from an Italian lady who\r\nbecame the mother of Fabius by Hercules near the river Tiber. From him\r\ndescended the family of the Fabii, one of the largest and most renowned\r\nin Rome. Some say that the men of this race were the first to use\r\npitfalls in hunting, and were anciently named Fodii in consequence; for\r\nup to the present day ditches are called _fossae_, and to dig is called\r\n_fodere_ in Latin: and thus in time the two sounds became confused, and\r\nthey obtained the name of Fabii. The family produced many distinguished\r\nmen, the greatest of whom was Rullus, who was for that reason named\r\nMaximus by the Romans. From him Fabius Maximus, of whom I am now\r\nwriting, was fourth in descent. His own personal nickname was\r\nVerrucosus, because he had a little wart growing on his upper lip. The\r\nname of Ovicula, signifying sheep, was also given him while yet a child,\r\nbecause of his slow and gentle disposition. He was quiet and silent,\r\nvery cautious in taking part in children's games, and learned his\r\nlessons slowly and with difficulty, which, combined with his easy\r\nobliging ways with his comrades, made those who did not know him think\r\nthat he was dull and stupid. Few there were who could discern, hidden in\r\nthe depths of his soul, his glorious and lion-like character. Soon,\r\nhowever, as time went on, and he began to take part in public affairs,\r\nhe proved that his apparent want of energy was really due to serenity of\r\nintellect, that he was cautious because he weighed matters well\r\nbeforehand, and that while he was never eager or easily moved, yet he\r\nwas always steady and trustworthy. Observing the immense extent of the\r\nempire, and the numerous wars in which it was engaged, he exercised his\r\nbody in warlike exercises, regarding it as his natural means of defence,\r\nwhile he also studied oratory as the means by which to influence the\r\npeople, in a style suited to his own life and character. In his speeches\r\nthere were no flowery passages, no empty graces of style, but there was\r\na plain common sense peculiar to himself, and a depth of sententious\r\nmaxims which is said to have resembled Thucydides. One of his speeches\r\nis extant, a funeral oration which he made in public over his son who\r\ndied after he had been consul.\r\n\r\nII. He was consul five times, and in his first consulship obtained a\r\ntriumph over the Ligurians. They were defeated by him and driven with\r\ngreat loss to take refuge in the Alps, and thus were prevented from\r\nravaging the neighbouring parts of Italy as they had been wont to do.\r\nWhen Hannibal invaded Italy, won his first battle at the Trebia, and\r\nmarched through Etruria, laying everything waste as he went, the Romans\r\nwere terribly disheartened and cast down, and terrible prodigies took\r\nplace, some of the usual kind, that is, by lightning, and others of an\r\nentirely new and strange character. It was said that shields of their\r\nown accord became drenched with blood: that at Antium standing corn bled\r\nwhen it was cut by the reapers; that red-hot stones fell from heaven,\r\nand that the sky above Falerii was seen to open and tablets to fall, on\r\none of which was written the words \"Mars is shaking his arms.\"\r\n\r\nNone of these omens had any effect upon Caius Flaminius, the consul,\r\nfor, besides his naturally spirited and ambitious nature, he was excited\r\nby the successes which he had previously won, contrary to all reasonable\r\nprobability. Once, against the express command of the Senate, and in\r\nspite of the opposition of his colleague, he engaged with the Gauls and\r\nwon a victory over them. Fabius also was but little disturbed by the\r\nomens, because of their strange and unintelligible character, though\r\nmany were alarmed at them. Knowing how few the enemy were in numbers,\r\nand their great want of money and supplies, he advised the Romans not\r\nto offer battle to a man who had at his disposal an army trained by many\r\nprevious encounters to a rare pitch of perfection, but rather to send\r\nreinforcements to their allies, keep a tight hand over their subject\r\ncities, and allow Hannibal's brilliant little force to die away like a\r\nlamp which flares up brightly with but little oil to sustain it.\r\n\r\nIII. This reasoning had no effect upon Flaminius, who said that he would\r\nnot endure to see an enemy marching upon Rome, and would not, like\r\nCamillus of old, fight in the streets of Rome herself. He ordered the\r\nmilitary tribunes to put the army in motion, and himself leaped upon his\r\nhorse's back. The horse for no visible reason shied in violent terror,\r\nand Flaminius was thrown headlong to the ground. He did not, however,\r\nalter his determination, but marched to meet Hannibal, and drew up his\r\nforces for battle near the lake Thrasymenus, in Etruria. When the armies\r\nmet, an earthquake took place which destroyed cities, changed the\r\ncourses of rivers, and cast down the crests of precipices; but in spite\r\nof its violence, no one of the combatants perceived it. Flaminius\r\nhimself, after many feats of strength and courage, fell dead, and around\r\nhim lay the bravest Romans. The rest fled, and the slaughter was so\r\ngreat that fifteen thousand were killed, and as many more taken\r\nprisoners. Hannibal generously desired to bury the body of Flaminius\r\nwith military honours, to show his esteem for the consul's bravery; but\r\nit could not be found among the slain, and no one knew how it\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe defeat at the Trebia had not been clearly explained either by the\r\ngeneral who wrote the despatch, or by the messenger who carried it, as\r\nthey falsely represented it to have been a drawn battle; but as soon as\r\nthe praetor Pomponius heard the news of this second misfortune, he\r\nassembled the people in the Forum, and said, without any roundabout\r\napologies whatever, \"Romans, we have lost a great battle, the army is\r\ndestroyed, and the consul Flaminius has fallen. Now, therefore, take\r\ncounsel for your own safety.\" These words produced the same impression\r\non the people that a gust of wind does upon the sea. No one could calmly\r\nreflect after such a sudden downfall of their hopes. All, however,\r\nagreed that the State required one irresponsible ruler, which the Romans\r\ncall a dictatorship, and a man who would fulfil this office with\r\nfearless energy. Such a man, they felt, was Fabius Maximus, who was\r\nsufficiently qualified for the office by his abilities and the respect\r\nwhich his countrymen bore him, and was moreover at that time of life\r\nwhen the strength of the body is fully capable of carrying out the ideas\r\nof the mind, but when courage is somewhat tempered by discretion.\r\n\r\nIV. As soon as the people had passed their decree, Fabius was appointed\r\ndictator,[A] and appointed Marcus Minucius his master of the horse.\r\nFirst, however, he begged of the Senate to allow him the use of a horse\r\nduring his campaigns. There was an ancient law forbidding this practice,\r\neither because the main strength of the army was thought to lie in the\r\ncolumns of infantry, and for that reason the dictator ought to remain\r\nalways with them, or else because, while in all other respects the\r\ndictator's power is equal to that of a king, it was thought well that in\r\nthis one point he should have to ask leave of the people. Next, however,\r\nFabius, wishing at once to show the greatness and splendour of his\r\noffice, and so make the citizens more ready to obey him, appeared in\r\npublic with all his twenty-four lictors at once; and when the surviving\r\nconsul met him, he sent an officer to bid him dismiss his lictors, lay\r\naside his insignia of office, and come before him as a mere private\r\ncitizen. After this he began in the best possible way, that is, by a\r\nreligious ceremony, and assured the people that it was in consequence of\r\nthe impiety and carelessness of their late general, not by any fault of\r\nthe army, that they had been defeated. Thus he encouraged them not to\r\nfear their enemies, but to respect the gods and render them propitious,\r\nnot that he implanted any superstitious observances among them, but he\r\nconfirmed their valour by piety, and took away from them all fear of the\r\nenemy by the hopes which he held out to them of divine protection. At\r\nthis time many of the holy and mysterious books, which contain secrets\r\nof great value to the State, were inspected. These are called the\r\nSibylline books. One of the sentences preserved in these was said to\r\nhave an evident bearing on contemporary events; what it was can only be\r\nguessed at by what was done. The dictator appeared before the people and\r\npublicly vowed to the gods a _ver sacrum_, that is, all the young which\r\nthe next spring should produce, from the goats, the sheep, and the kine\r\non every mountain, and plain, and river, and pasture within the bounds\r\nof Italy. All these he swore that he would sacrifice, and moreover that\r\nhe would exhibit musical and dramatic shows, and expend upon them the\r\nsum of three hundred and thirty-three _sestertia_, and three hundred and\r\nthirty-three _denarii_, and one-third of a _denarius_. The sum total of\r\nthis in our Greek money is eighty-three thousand five hundred and\r\neighty-three drachmas and two obols. What the particular virtue of this\r\nexact number may be it is hard to determine, unless it be on account of\r\nthe value of the number three, which is by nature perfect, and the first\r\nof odd numbers, the first also of plurals, and containing within itself\r\nall the elements of the qualities of number.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Liv., xxii. 8, _sq._]\r\n\r\nV. Fabius, by teaching the people to rest their hopes on religion, made\r\nthem view the future with a more cheerful heart. For his own part, he\r\ntrusted entirely to himself to win the victory, believing that Heaven\r\ngrants men success according to the valour and conduct which they\r\ndisplay. He marched against Hannibal, not with any design of fighting\r\nhim, but of wearing out his army by long delays, until he could, by his\r\nsuperior numbers and resources, deal with him easily. With this object\r\nin view he always took care to secure himself from Hannibal's cavalry,\r\nby occupying the mountains overhanging the Carthaginian camp, where he\r\nremained quiet as long as the enemy did, but when they moved he used to\r\naccompany them, showing himself at intervals upon the heights at such a\r\ndistance as not to be forced to fight against his will, and yet, from\r\nthe very slowness of his movements, making the enemy fear that at every\r\nmoment he was about to attack. By these dilatory manoeuvres he incurred\r\ngeneral contempt, and was looked upon with disgust by his own soldiers,\r\nwhile the enemy, with the exception of one man, thought him utterly\r\nwithout warlike enterprise. That man was Hannibal himself. He alone\r\nperceived Fabius's true generalship and thorough comprehension of the\r\nwar, and saw that either he must by some means be brought to fight a\r\nbattle, or else the Carthaginians were lost, if they could not make use\r\nof their superiority in arms, but were to be worn away and reduced in\r\nnumber and resources, in which they were already deficient. He put in\r\nforce every conceivable military stratagem and device, like a skilful\r\nwrestler when he tries to lay hold of his antagonist, and kept attacking\r\nFabius, skirmishing round him, and drawing him from place to place, in\r\nhis endeavours to make him quit his policy of caution. But Fabius was\r\nconvinced that he was right, and steadily declined battle. His master of\r\nthe horse, Minucius, who longed for action, gave him much trouble. This\r\nman made unseemly boasts, and harangued the army, filling it with wild\r\nexcitement and self-confidence. The soldiers in derision used to call\r\nFabius Hannibal's lacquey, because he followed him wherever he went, and\r\nthought Minucius a really great general, and worthy of the name of\r\nRoman. Minucius, encouraged in his arrogant vauntings, began to ridicule\r\nthe habit of encamping on the mountain-tops, saying that the dictator\r\nalways took care to provide them with good seats from which to behold\r\nthe spectacle of the burning and plundering of Italy, and used to ask\r\nthe friends of Fabius whether he took his army up so near the sky\r\nbecause he had ceased to take any interest in what went on on the earth\r\nbelow, or whether it was in order to conceal it from the enemy among the\r\nclouds and mists. When Fabius was informed of these insults by his\r\nfriends, who begged him to wipe away this disgrace by risking a battle,\r\nhe answered, \"If I did so, I should be more cowardly than I am now\r\nthought to be, in abandoning the policy which I have determined on\r\nbecause of men's slanders and sneers. It is no shame to fear for one's\r\ncountry, but to regard the opinions and spiteful criticisms of the\r\npeople would be unworthy of the high office which I hold, and would show\r\nme the slave of those whom I ought to govern and restrain when they\r\nwould fain do wrong.\"\r\n\r\nVI. After this, Hannibal made a blunder. Wishing to move his army\r\nfurther from that of Fabius, and to gain an open part of the country\r\nwhere he could obtain forage, he ordered his guides one night after\r\nsupper to lead the way at once to Casinatum. They, misunderstanding him\r\nbecause of his foreign pronunciation, led his forces to the borders of\r\nCampania, near the city of Casilinum, through the midst of which flows\r\nthe river Lothronus, which the Romans call Vulturnus. This country is\r\nfull of mountains, except one valley that runs towards the sea-coast,\r\nwhere the river at the end of its course overflows into extensive\r\nmarshes, with deep beds of sand. The beach itself is rough and\r\nimpracticable for shipping.\r\n\r\nWhen Hannibal was marching down this valley, Fabius, by his superior\r\nknowledge of the country, came up with him, placed four thousand men to\r\nguard the narrow outlet, established the main body in a safe position in\r\nthe mountains, and with the light-armed troops fell upon and harassed\r\nthe rear of Hannibal's army, throwing it all into disorder, and killing\r\nabout eight hundred men. Upon this, Hannibal determined to retrace his\r\nsteps. Perceiving the mistake which he had made, and the danger he was\r\nin, he crucified his guides, but still could not tell how to force his\r\nway out through the Roman army which was in possession of the mountain\r\npasses. While all were terrified and disheartened, believing themselves\r\nto be beset on all sides by dangers from which there was no escape,\r\nHannibal decided on extricating himself by stratagem. Taking about two\r\nthousand captured oxen, he ordered his soldiers to bind a torch or\r\nfaggot of dry wood to their horns, and at night at a given signal to set\r\nthem on fire, and drive the animals towards the narrow outlet near the\r\nenemy's camp. While this was being done, he got the remainder of the\r\ntroops under arms and led them slowly forward. The cattle, while the\r\nflame was moderate, and burned only the wood, walked steadily forward\r\ntowards the mountain side, astonishing the shepherds on the mountain,\r\nwho thought that it must be an army, marching in one great column,\r\ncarrying torches. But when their horns were burned to the quick, causing\r\nthem considerable pain, the beasts, now scorched by the fire from one\r\nanother as they shook their heads, set off in wild career over the\r\nmountains, with their foreheads and tails blazing, setting fire to a\r\ngreat part of the wood through which they passed. The Romans watching\r\nthe pass were terribly scared at the sight; for the flames looked like\r\ntorches carried by men running, and they fell into great confusion and\r\nalarm, thinking that they were surrounded, and about to be attacked on\r\nall sides by the enemy. They dared not remain at their post, but\r\nabandoned the pass, and made for the main body. At that moment\r\nHannibal's light troops took possession of the heights commanding the\r\noutlet, and the main army marched safely through, loaded with plunder.\r\n\r\nVII. It happened that while it was yet night Fabius perceived the trick;\r\nfor some of the oxen in their flight had fallen into the hands of the\r\nRomans; but, fearing to fall into an ambuscade in the darkness, he kept\r\nhis men quiet under arms. When day broke he pursued and attacked the\r\nrearguard, which led to many confused skirmishes in the rough ground,\r\nand produced great confusion, till Hannibal sent back his practised\r\nSpanish mountaineers from the head of his column. These men, being light\r\nand active, attacked the heavily-armed Roman infantry and beat off\r\nFabius' attack with very considerable loss. Now Fabius's unpopularity\r\nreached its highest pitch, and he was regarded with scorn and contempt.\r\nHe had, they said, determined to refrain from a pitched battle, meaning\r\nto overcome Hannibal by superior generalship, and he had been defeated\r\nin that too. And Hannibal himself, wishing to increase the dislike which\r\nthe Romans felt for him, though he burned and ravaged every other part\r\nof Italy, forbade his men to touch Fabius's own estates, and even placed\r\na guard to see that no damage was done to them. This was reported at\r\nRome, greatly to his discredit; and the tribunes of the people brought\r\nall kinds of false accusations against him in public harangues,\r\ninstigated chiefly by Metilius, who was not Fabius's personal enemy, but\r\nbeing a relative of Minucius, the Master of the Horse, thought that he\r\nwas pressing the interests of the latter by giving currency to all these\r\nscandalous reports about Fabius. He was also disliked by the Senate\r\nbecause of the terms which he had arranged with Hannibal about the\r\nexchange of prisoners. The two commanders agreed that the prisoners\r\nshould be exchanged man for man, and that if either party had more than\r\nthe other, he should redeem for two hundred and fifty drachmas per man.\r\nWhen, then, this exchange took place, two hundred and forty Romans were\r\nfound remaining in Hannibal's hands. The Senate determined not to send\r\nthese men's ransom, and blamed Fabius for having acted improperly and\r\nagainst the interests of the State in taking back men whose cowardice\r\nhad made them fall into the hands of the enemy. Fabius, on hearing this,\r\nwas not moved at the discontent of the citizens, but having no money, as\r\nhe could not bear to deceive Hannibal and give up his countrymen, sent\r\nhis son to Rome with orders to sell part of his estate, and bring him\r\nthe money at once to the camp. The young man soon sold the land, and\r\nquickly returned. Fabius now sent the ransom to Hannibal and recovered\r\nthe prisoners, many of whom afterwards offered to repay him; but he\r\nwould take nothing, and forgave their debt to them all.\r\n\r\nVIII. After this the priests recalled him to Rome to perform certain\r\nsacrifices. He now transferred the command to Minucius, and not merely\r\nordered him as dictator not to fight or entangle himself with the enemy,\r\nbut even gave him much advice and besought him not to do so, all of\r\nwhich Minucius set at nought, and at once attacked the enemy. Once he\r\nobserved that Hannibal had sent the greater part of his army out to\r\nforage for provisions, and, attacking the remaining troops, he drove\r\nthem into their intrenched camp, slew many, and terrified the rest, who\r\nfeared that he might carry the camp by assault. When Hannibal's forces\r\ncollected again, Minucius effected his retreat with safety, having\r\nexcited both himself and the army with his success, and filled them with\r\na spirit of reckless daring. Soon an inflated report of the action\r\nreached Rome. Fabius, when he heard of it, said that with Minucius he\r\nfeared success more than failure; but the populace were delighted, and\r\njoyfully collected in the Forum, where Metilius the tribune ascended the\r\nrostra, and made a speech glorifying Minucius, and accusing Fabius not\r\nmerely of remissness or cowardice, but of actual treachery, accusing\r\nalso the other leading men of the city of having brought on the war from\r\nthe very beginning in order to destroy the constitution; and he also\r\ncharged them with having placed the city in the hands of one man as\r\ndictator, who by his dilatory proceedings would give Hannibal time to\r\nestablish himself firmly and to obtain reinforcements from Africa to\r\nenable him to conquer Italy.\r\n\r\nIX. When Fabius addressed the people, he did not deign to make any\r\ndefence against the accusations of the tribune, but said that he should\r\naccomplish his sacrifices and sacred duties as quickly as possible, in\r\norder to return to the army and punish Minucius for having fought a\r\nbattle against his orders. At this a great clamour was raised by the\r\npeople, who feared for their favourite Minucius, for a dictator has\r\npower to imprison any man, and even to put him to death; and they\r\nthought that Fabius, a mild-tempered man now at last stirred up to\r\nwrath, would be harsh and inexorable. All refrained from speaking, but\r\nMetilius, having nothing to fear because of the privileges of his office\r\nof tribune (for that is the only office which does not lose its\r\nprerogatives on the election of a dictator, but remains untouched though\r\nall the rest are annulled), made a violent appeal to the people, begging\r\nthem not to give up Minucius, nor allow him to be treated as Manlius\r\nTorquatus treated his son, who had him beheaded, although he had fought\r\nmost bravely and gained a crown of laurel for his victory. He asked them\r\nto remove Fabius from his dictatorship, and to bestow it upon one who\r\nwas able and willing to save the country. Excited as they were by these\r\nwords, they yet did not venture upon removing Fabius from his post, in\r\nspite of their feeling against him, but they decreed that Minucius\r\nshould conduct the war, having equal powers with the dictator, a thing\r\nnever before done in Rome, but which occurred shortly afterwards, after\r\nthe disaster at Cannae, when Marcus Junius was dictator in the camp,\r\nand, as many members of the Senate had perished in the battle, they\r\nchose another dictator, Fabius Buteo. However, he, after enrolling the\r\nnew senators, on the same day dismissed his lictors, got rid of the\r\ncrowd which escorted him, and mixed with the people in the Forum,\r\ntransacting some business of his own as a private man.\r\n\r\nX. Now the people, by placing Minucius on the same footing with the\r\ndictator, thought to humble Fabius, but they formed a very false\r\nestimate of his character. He did not reckon their ignorance to be his\r\nmisfortune, but as Diogenes the philosopher, when some one said \"They\r\nare deriding you,\" answered \"But I am not derided,\" thinking that those\r\nalone are derided who are affected and disturbed by it, so Fabius\r\nquietly and unconcernedly endured all that was done, hereby affording an\r\nexample of the truth of that philosophic maxim that a good and honest\r\nman can suffer no disgrace. Yet he grieved over the folly of the people\r\non public grounds, because they had given a man of reckless ambition an\r\nopportunity for indulging his desire for battle; and, fearing that\r\nMinucius would be altogether beside himself with pride and vain glory,\r\nand would soon do some irreparable mischief, he left Rome unperceived by\r\nany one. On reaching the camp, he found Minucius no longer endurable,\r\nbut insolent and overbearing, and demanding to have the sole command\r\nevery other day. To this Fabius would not agree, but divided his forces\r\nwith him, thinking it better to command a part than partly to command\r\nthe whole of the army. He took the first and fourth legion, and left the\r\nsecond and third to Minucius, dividing the auxiliary troops equally with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAs Minucius gave himself great airs, and was gratified at the thought\r\nthat the greatest officer in the State had been humbled and brought low\r\nby his means, Fabius reminded him that if he judged aright, he would\r\nregard Hannibal, not Fabius, as his enemy; but that if he persisted in\r\nhis rivalry with his colleagues, he must beware lest he, the honoured\r\nvictor, should appear more careless of the safety and success of his\r\ncountrymen, than he who had been overcome and ill-treated by them.\r\n\r\nXI. Minucius thought all this to be merely the expression of the old\r\nman's jealousy. He took his allotted troops, and encamped apart from\r\nhim. Hannibal was not ignorant of what was passing, and watched all\r\ntheir movements narrowly.\r\n\r\nThere was a hill between the two armies, which it was not difficult to\r\ntake, which when taken would afford an army a safe position, and one\r\nwell supplied with necessaries. The plain by which it was surrounded\r\nappeared to be perfectly smooth, but was nevertheless intersected with\r\nditches and other hollow depressions. On this account Hannibal would not\r\ntake the hill, although he could easily have done so, but preferred to\r\nleave it untouched, in order to draw the enemy into fighting for its\r\npossession. But as soon as he saw Fabius separated from Minucius, he\r\nplaced during the night some troops in the depressions and hollows which\r\nwe have mentioned, and at daybreak sent a few men to take the hill, in\r\norder to draw Minucius into fighting for it, in which he succeeded.\r\nMinucius first sent out his light troops, then his cavalry, and finally,\r\nseeing that Hannibal was reinforcing the troops on the hill, he came\r\ndown with his entire force. He fought stoutly, and held his own against\r\nthe soldiers on the hill, who shot their missiles at him; when Hannibal,\r\nseeing him thoroughly deceived, and offering an unprotected flank to the\r\ntroops in the ambush, gave them the signal to charge. Upon this they\r\nattacked the Romans from all sides, rushing upon them with loud shouts,\r\ncutting off the rearmost men, and throwing the whole army into confusion\r\nand panic. Minucius himself lost heart and kept glancing first at one\r\nand then at another of his officers, none of whom ventured to stand\r\ntheir ground, but betook themselves in a confused mass to running away,\r\na proceeding which brought them no safety, for the Numidian horsemen, as\r\nthe day was now theirs, scoured the plain, encompassing the fugitives,\r\nand cut off all stragglers.\r\n\r\nXII. Fabius had carefully watched the Romans, and saw in what danger\r\nthey were. Conscious, it would seem, of what was going to happen, he had\r\nkept his troops under arms, and gained his information of what was going\r\non, not from the reports of scouts, but from his own eyesight, from a\r\nconvenient height outside of his camp. As soon as he saw the army\r\nsurrounded and panic-stricken, and heard the cries of the Romans, who no\r\nlonger fought, but were overcome by terror, and betaking themselves to\r\nflight, he smote his thigh and with a deep sigh, said to his friends,\r\n\"By Hercules, now Minucius has ruined himself, quicker than I expected,\r\nand yet slower than his manoeuvres warranted.\" Having given orders to\r\ncarry out the standards as quickly as possible, and for the whole army\r\nto follow, he said aloud, \"My men, hurry on your march: think of Marcus\r\nMinucius; he is a brave man and loves his country. If he has made any\r\nmistake in his haste to drive out the enemy, we will blame him for that\r\nat another time.\" The appearance of Fabius scared and drove back the\r\nNumidians, who were slaughtering the fugitives in the plain; next he\r\nbore against those who were attacking the Roman rear, slaying all he\r\nmet, though most of them, before they were cut off and treated as they\r\nhad treated the Romans, betook themselves to flight. Hannibal seeing\r\nthat the fortune of the battle was changed, and how Fabius himself, with\r\na strength beyond his years, was forcing his way through the thickest\r\nbattle up the hill to reach Minucius, withdrew his troops, and, sounding\r\na retreat, led them back into his entrenched camp, affording a most\r\nseasonable relief to the Romans. It is said that Hannibal as he retired,\r\nspoke jokingly about Fabius to his friends in the words, \"Did I not\r\noften warn you that the dark cloud which has so long brooded on the\r\nmountain tops, would at last break upon us with blasts of hail and\r\nstorm?\"\r\n\r\nXIII. After the battle Fabius collected the spoils of such of the enemy\r\nas were slain, and drew off his forces without letting fall a single\r\nboastful or offensive expression about his colleague. But Minucius\r\nassembled his own troops, and thus addressed them, \"My fellow-soldiers,\r\nit is beyond human skill to make no mistakes in matters of importance,\r\nbut it is the part of a man of courage and sense to use his mistakes as\r\nwarnings for the future. I myself confess that I have little fault to\r\nfind with Fortune, and great reason to thank her; for in the space of\r\none day I have learned what I never knew in all my previous life: that\r\nis, that I am not able to command others, but myself require a\r\ncommander, and I have no ambition to conquer a man by whom it is more\r\nglorious to be defeated. The dictator is your leader in everything\r\nexcept in this, that I will lead you to express your thankfulness to\r\nhim, by being the first to offer myself to him as an example of\r\nobedience and willingness to carry out his orders.\" After these words\r\nhe ordered the eagles to be raised aloft and all the soldiers to follow\r\nthem to the camp of Fabius. On entering it, he proceeded to the\r\nGeneral's tent, to the surprise and wonderment of all. When Fabius was\r\ncome out, he placed his standards in the ground before him, and himself\r\naddressed him as father in a loud voice, while his soldiers greeted\r\nthose of Fabius by the name of their Patrons, which is the name by which\r\nfreed men address those who have set them free. Silence being enforced,\r\nMinucius said: \"Dictator, you have won two victories to-day, for you\r\nhave conquered Hannibal by your bravery, and your colleague by your\r\nkindness and your generalship. By the one you have saved our lives, and\r\nby the other you have taught us our duty, for we have been disgracefully\r\ndefeated by Hannibal, but beneficially and honourably by you. I call you\r\nmy excellent father, having no more honourable appellation to bestow,\r\nsince I owe a greater debt of gratitude to you than to him who begot me.\r\nTo him I merely owe my single life, but to you I owe not only that but\r\nthe lives of all my men.\" After these words he embraced Fabius, and the\r\nsoldiers followed his example, embracing and kissing one another, so\r\nthat the camp was full of joy and of most blessed tears.\r\n\r\nXIV. After this, Fabius laid down his office, and consuls were again\r\nelected. Those who were first elected followed the defensive policy of\r\nFabius, avoiding pitched battles with Hannibal, but reinforcing the\r\nallies and preventing defections. But when Terentius Varro was made\r\nconsul, a man of low birth, but notorious for his rash temper and his\r\npopularity with the people, he made no secret, in his inexperience and\r\nself-confidence, of his intention of risking everything on one cast. He\r\nwas always reiterating in his public speeches that under such generals\r\nas Fabius the war made no progress, whereas he would conquer the enemy\r\nthe first day he saw him. By means of these boastful speeches he\r\nenrolled as soldiers such a multitude as the Romans had never before had\r\nat their disposal in any war, for there collected for the battle\r\neighty-eight thousand men. This caused great disquietude to Fabius and\r\nother sensible Romans, who feared that if so many of the youth of Rome\r\nwere cut off, the city would never recover from the blow. They addressed\r\nthemselves therefore to the other consul, Paulus Aemilius, a man of\r\ngreat experience in war, but disagreeable to the people and afraid of\r\nthem because he had once been fined by them. Fabius encouraged him to\r\nattempt to hold the other consul's rashness in check, pointing out that\r\nhe would have to fight for his country's safety with Terentius Varro no\r\nless than with Hannibal. Varro, he said, will hasten to engage because\r\nhe does not know his own strength, and Hannibal will do so because he\r\nknows his own weakness. \"I myself, Paulus,\" said he, \"am more to be\r\nbelieved than Varro as to the condition of Hannibal's affairs, and I am\r\nsure that if no battle takes place with him for a year, he will either\r\nperish in this country or be compelled to quit it; because even now,\r\nwhen he seems to be victorious and carrying all before him, not one of\r\nhis enemies have come over to his side, while scarcely a third of the\r\nforce which he brought from home is now surviving.\" It is said that\r\nPaulus answered as follows: \"For my own part, Fabius, it is better for\r\nme to fall by the spears of the enemy than be again condemned by the\r\nvotes of my own countrymen; but if public affairs are indeed in this\r\ncritical situation, I will endeavour rather to approve myself a good\r\ngeneral to you than to all those who are urging me to the opposite\r\ncourse.\" With this determination Paulus began the campaign.\r\n\r\nXV. Varro induced his colleague to adopt the system of each consul\r\nholding the chief command on alternate days. He proceeded to encamp near\r\nHannibal on the banks of the river Aufidus, close to the village of\r\nCannae. At daybreak he showed the signal of battle (a red tunic\r\ndisplayed over the General's tent), so that the Carthaginians were at\r\nfirst disheartened at the daring of the consul and the great number of\r\nhis troops, more than twice that of their own army. Hannibal ordered his\r\nsoldiers to get under arms, and himself rode with a few others to a\r\nrising ground, from which he viewed the enemy, who were already forming\r\ntheir ranks. When one Gisco, a man of his own rank, said to him that the\r\nnumbers of the enemy were wonderful, Hannibal with a serious air\r\nreplied, \"Another circumstance much more wonderful than this has escaped\r\nyour notice, Gisco.\" When Gisco asked what it might be, Hannibal\r\nanswered, \"It is, that among all those men before you there is not one\r\nnamed Gisco.\" At this unexpected answer they all began to laugh, and as\r\nthey came down the hill they kept telling this joke to all whom they\r\nmet, so that the laugh became universal, and Hannibal's staff was quite\r\noverpowered with merriment. The Carthaginian soldiers seeing this took\r\ncourage, thinking that their General must be in a position to despise\r\nhis enemy if he could thus laugh and jest in the presence of danger.\r\n\r\nXVI. In the battle Hannibal employed several stratagems: first, in\r\nsecuring the advantage of position, by getting the wind at his back, for\r\nit blew a hurricane, raising a harsh dust from the sandy plains, which\r\nrose over the Carthaginians and blew in the faces of the Romans,\r\nthrowing them into confusion. Secondly, in his disposition of his forces\r\nhe showed great skill. The best troops were placed on the wings, and the\r\ncentre, which was composed of the worst, was made to project far beyond\r\nthe rest of the line. The troops on each wing were told that when the\r\nRomans had driven in this part of the line and were so become partly\r\nenclosed, that each wing must turn inwards, and attack them in the flank\r\nand rear and endeavour to surround them. This was the cause of the\r\ngreatest slaughter; for when the centre gave way, and made room for the\r\npursuing Romans, Hannibal's line assumed a crescent form, and the\r\ncommanders of the select battalions charging from the right and left of\r\nthe Romans attacked them in flank, destroying every man except such as\r\nescaped being surrounded. It is related that a similar disaster befel\r\nthe Roman cavalry. The horse of Paulus was wounded, and threw its rider,\r\nupon which man after man of his staff dismounted and came to help the\r\nconsul on foot. The cavalry, seeing this, took it for a general order to\r\ndismount, and at once attacked the enemy on foot. Hannibal, seeing this,\r\nsaid, \"I am better pleased at this than if he had handed them over to me\r\nbound hand and foot.\" This anecdote is found in those writers who have\r\ndescribed the incidents of the battle in detail. Of the consuls, Varro\r\nescaped with a few followers to Venusia. Paulus, in the whirling eddies\r\nof the rout, covered with darts which still stuck in his wounds, and\r\noverwhelmed with sorrow at the defeat, sat down on a stone to await his\r\ndeath at the hands of the enemy. The blood with which his face and head\r\nwere covered made it hard for any one to recognise him; but even his own\r\nfriends and servants passed him by, taking no heed of him. Only\r\nCornelius Lentulus, a young patrician, saw and recognised him.\r\nDismounting from his horse and leading it up to him he begged him to\r\ntake it and preserve his life, at a time when the State especially\r\nneeded a wise ruler. But he refused, and forced the youth, in spite of\r\nhis tears, to remount his horse. He then took him by the hand, saying,\r\n\"Lentulus, tell Fabius Maximus, and bear witness yourself, that Paulus\r\nAemilius followed his instructions to the last, and departed from\r\nnothing of what was agreed upon between us; but he was vanquished first\r\nby Varro, and secondly by Hannibal.\" Having given Lentulus these\r\ninstructions he sent him away, and flinging himself on to the enemy's\r\nswords perished. In that battle it is reckoned that fifty thousand\r\nRomans fell, and four thousand were taken prisoners, besides not less\r\nthan ten thousand who were taken after the battle in the camps of the\r\ntwo consuls.\r\n\r\nXVII. After this immense success, Hannibal was urged by his friends to\r\nfollow up his victory and enter Rome with the fugitives, promising that\r\nfive days thereafter he should sup in the Capitol. It is not easy to say\r\nwhat reasons could have deterred him from doing so, and it seems rather\r\nas if some divinity prevented his march, and inspired him with the\r\ndilatory and timid policy which he followed. It is said that the\r\nCarthaginian, Barca, said to him, \"You know how to win a victory, but do\r\nnot know how to use one.\" Yet so great a change was effected by this\r\nvictory that he, who before it had not possessed a single city, market,\r\nor harbour in Italy, and had to obtain his provisions with the utmost\r\ndifficulty by plunder, having no regular base of operations, but merely\r\nwandering about with his army as though carrying on brigandage on a\r\nlarge scale, now saw nearly the whole of Italy at his feet. Some of the\r\nlargest and most powerful States came over to him of their own accord,\r\nand he attacked and took Capua, the most important city next to Rome\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that the saying of Euripides, that \"adversity tries our\r\nfriends,\" applies also to good generals. That which before this battle\r\nwas called Fabius's cowardice and remissness, was now regarded as more\r\nthan human sagacity, and a foresight so wonderful as to be beyond\r\nbelief. Rome at once centred her last hopes upon Fabius, taking refuge\r\nin his wisdom as men take sanctuary at an altar, believing his\r\ndiscretion to be the chief cause of her surviving this present crisis,\r\neven as in the old Gaulish troubles. For though he had been so cautious\r\nand backward at a time when there seemed to be no imminent danger, yet\r\nnow when every one was giving way to useless grief and lamentation, he\r\nalone walked through the streets at a calm pace, with a composed\r\ncountenance and kindly voice, stopped all womanish wailings and\r\nassemblies in public to lament their losses, persuaded the Senate to\r\nmeet, and gave fresh courage to the magistrates, being really himself\r\nthe moving spirit and strength of the State, which looked to him alone\r\nto command it.\r\n\r\nXVIII. He placed guards at the gates to prevent the mob from quitting\r\nthe city, and regulated the period of mourning, bidding every man mourn\r\nfor thirty days in his own house, after which all signs of mourning were\r\nto be put away. As the feast of Ceres fell during those days, it was\r\nthought better to omit both the sacrifices and the processions than to\r\nhave them marred by the consciousness of their misfortune, which would\r\nbe painfully evident in the small number of worshippers and their\r\ndowncast looks. However, everything that the soothsayers commanded to\r\nappease the anger of the gods and to expiate prodigies was carried out.\r\nFabius Pictor, a relative of the great Fabius, was sent to Delphi, and\r\nof two of the Vestal virgins who were found to have been seduced, one\r\nwas buried alive, as is the usual custom, while the other died by her\r\nown hand. Especially admirable was the spirit and the calm composure of\r\nthe city when the consul Varro returned after his flight. He came\r\nhumbled to the dust, as a man would who had been the cause of a\r\nterrible disaster, but at the gate the Senate and all the people went\r\nout to greet him. The chief men and the magistrates, amongst whom was\r\nFabius, having obtained silence, spoke in praise of him \"because he had\r\nnot despaired of the State after such a calamity, but had come back to\r\nundertake the conduct of affairs and do what he could for his countrymen\r\nas one who thought they might yet be saved.\"\r\n\r\nXIX. When they learned that Hannibal after the battle had turned away\r\nfrom Rome to other parts of Italy, the Romans again took courage and\r\nsent out armies and generals. Of those the most remarkable were Fabius\r\nMaximus and Claudius Marcellus, both equally admirable, but from an\r\nentirely different point of view. Marcellus, as has been related in his\r\nLife, was a man of activity and high spirit, rejoicing in a hand-to-hand\r\nfight, and just like the lordly warriors of Homer. With a truly\r\nventuresome audacity, he in his first battles outdid in boldness even\r\nthe bold Hannibal himself; while Fabius, on the other hand, was\r\nconvinced that his former reasoning was true, and believed that without\r\nany one fighting or even meddling with Hannibal, his army would wear\r\nitself out and consume away, just as the body of an athlete when\r\noverstrained and exerted soon loses its fine condition. For this reason\r\nPoseidonius calls Fabius the shield, and Marcellus the sword of Rome,\r\nbecause the steadiness of Fabius, combined with the warlike ardour of\r\nMarcellus, proved the saving of the state. Hannibal, frequently meeting\r\nMarcellus, who was like a raging torrent, had his forces shaken and\r\nweakened; while Fabius, like a deep quiet river kept constantly\r\nundermining them and wasting them away unperceived. Hannibal was at\r\nlength reduced to such extremities that he was weary of fighting\r\nMarcellus, and feared Fabius even though he did not fight: for these\r\nwere the persons whom he generally had to deal with, as praetors,\r\nconsuls, or pro-consuls, for each of them was five times consul. He drew\r\nMarcellus, when consul for the fifth time, into an ambuscade; but\r\nalthough he tried every art and stratagem upon Fabius he could effect\r\nnothing, except once, when he very nearly succeeded in ruining him. He\r\nforged letters from the leading citizens of Metapontum, and then sent\r\nthem to Fabius. These letters were to the effect that the city would\r\nsurrender if he appeared before it, and that the conspirators were only\r\nwaiting for his approach. Fabius was so much moved by these letters as\r\nto take a part of his army and commence a night march thither; but\r\nmeeting with unfavourable omens on the way he turned back, and soon\r\nafterwards learned that the letters were a stratagem of Hannibal's, who\r\nwas waiting for him under the city walls. This escape one may attribute\r\nto the favour of Heaven.\r\n\r\nXX. In the case of revolts and insurrections among the subject cities\r\nand allies, Fabius thought it best to restrain them and discountenance\r\ntheir proceedings in a gentle manner, not treating every suspected\r\nperson with harshness, or inquiring too strictly into every case of\r\nsuspected disloyalty. It is said that a Marsian soldier, one of the\r\nchief men of the allies for bravery and nobility of birth, was\r\ndiscovered by Fabius to be engaged in organizing a revolt. Fabius showed\r\nno sign of anger, but admitted that he had not been treated with the\r\ndistinction he deserved, and said that in the present instance he should\r\nblame his officers for distributing rewards more by favour than by\r\nmerit; but that in future he should be vexed with him if he did not\r\napply directly to himself when he had any request to make. Saying this,\r\nhe presented him with a war horse and other marks of honour, so that\r\nthenceforth the man always served him with the utmost zeal and fidelity.\r\nHe thought it a shame that trainers of horses and dogs should be able to\r\ntame the savage spirit of those animals by careful attention and\r\neducation rather than by whips and clogs, and yet that a commander of\r\nmen should not rely chiefly on mild and conciliatory measures, but treat\r\nthem more harshly than gardeners treat the wild fig-trees, wild pears,\r\nand wild olives, which they by careful cultivation turn into trees\r\nbearing good fruit. His captains informed him that a certain soldier, a\r\nLucanian by birth, was irregular and often absent from his duty. He made\r\ninquiries as to what his general conduct was. All agreed that it would\r\nbe difficult to find a better soldier, and related some of his exploits.\r\nFabius at length discovered that the cause of his absence was that he\r\nwas in love with a certain girl, and that he continually ran the risk of\r\nmaking long journeys from the camp to meet her. Without the knowledge of\r\nthe soldier, he sent and apprehended this girl, whom he concealed in his\r\nown tent. Then he invited the Lucanian to a private interview, and\r\naddressed him as follows:--\"You have been observed frequently to pass\r\nthe night outside of the camp, contrary to the ancient practice and\r\ndiscipline of the Roman army: but also, you have been observed to be a\r\nbrave man. Your crime is atoned for by your valiant deeds, but for the\r\nfuture I shall commit you to the custody of another person.\" Then, to\r\nthe astonishment of the soldier, he led the girl forward, joined their\r\nhands, and said: \"This lady pledges her word that you will remain in the\r\ncamp with us. You must prove by your conduct that it was not from any\r\nunworthy motive, for which she was the pretext, but solely through love\r\nfor her that you used to desert your post.\" This is the story which is\r\nrelated about him.\r\n\r\nXXI. Fabius obtained possession of Tarentum by treachery in the\r\nfollowing manner. In his army was a young man of Tarentum whose sister\r\nwas devotedly attached to him. Her lover was a Bruttian, and one of the\r\nofficers of Hannibal's garrison there. This gave the Tarentine hopes of\r\neffecting his purpose, and with the consent of Fabius he went into the\r\ncity, being commonly supposed to have run away to see his sister. For\r\nthe first few days the Bruttian remained in his quarters, as she wished\r\nher amour with him not to be known to her brother. He then, however,\r\nsaid: \"There was a rumour in the army that you were intimate with one of\r\nthe chiefs of the garrison. Who is he? for if he is as they say, a man\r\nof courage and distinction--war, which throws everything into confusion,\r\nwill care little what countryman he may be. Nothing is disgraceful which\r\nwe cannot avoid; but it is a blessing, at a time when justice has no\r\npower, that we should yield to a not disagreeable necessity.\" Upon this\r\nthe lady sent for her Bruttian admirer and introduced him to her\r\nbrother. He, by encouraging the stranger in his passion, and assuring\r\nhim that he would induce his sister to look favourably on it, had no\r\ndifficulty in inducing the man, who was a mercenary soldier, to break\r\nhis faith in expectation of the great rewards which he was promised by\r\nFabius. This is the account given of the transaction by most writers,\r\nthough some say that the lady by whose means the Bruttian was seduced\r\nfrom his allegiance was not a Tarentine, but a Bruttian by race, who was\r\non intimate terms with Fabius; and that as soon as she discovered that a\r\nfellow-countryman and acquaintance of hers was in command of the\r\nBruttian garrison, told Fabius of it, and by interviews which she had\r\nwith the officer outside the walls gradually won him over to the Roman\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nXXII. While these negotiations were in progress, Fabius, wishing to\r\ncontrive something to draw Hannibal away, sent orders to the troops at\r\nRhegium to ravage the Bruttian country and take Caulonia by storm. The\r\ntroops at Rhegium were a body of eight thousand men, mostly deserters:\r\nand the most worthless of those disgraced soldiers whom Marcellus\r\nbrought from Sicily, so that their loss would not cause any sorrow or\r\nharm to Rome; while he hoped that by throwing them out as a bait to\r\nHannibal he might draw him away from Tarentum, as indeed he did.\r\nHannibal at once started with his army to attack them, and meanwhile, on\r\nthe sixth day after Fabius arrived before Tarentum, the young man having\r\npreviously concerted measures with the Bruttian and his sister, came to\r\nhim by night and told him that all was ready; knowing accurately and\r\nhaving well inspected the place where the Bruttian would be ready to\r\nopen the gate and let in the besiegers. Fabius would not depend entirely\r\nupon the chance of treachery; but though he himself went quietly to the\r\nappointed place, the rest of the army attacked the town both by sea and\r\nland, with great clamour and disturbance, until, when most of the\r\nTarentines had run to repel the assault, the Bruttian gave the word to\r\nFabius, and, mounting his scaling ladders, he took the place. On this\r\noccasion Fabius seems to have acted unworthily of his reputation, for he\r\nordered the chief Bruttian officers to be put to the sword, that it\r\nmight not be said that he gained the place by treachery. However, he\r\ndid not obtain this glory, and gained a reputation for faithlessness and\r\ncruelty. Many of the Tarentines were put to death, thirty thousand were\r\nsold for slaves, and the city was sacked by the soldiers. Three thousand\r\ntalents were brought into the public treasury.\r\n\r\nWhile everything else was being carried off, it is said that the clerk\r\nwho was taking the inventory asked Fabius what his pleasure was with\r\nregard to the gods, meaning the statues and pictures. Fabius replied,\r\n\"Let us leave the Tarentines their angry gods.\" However, he took the\r\nstatue of Hercules from Tarentum and placed it in the Capitol, and near\r\nto it he placed a brazen statue of himself on horseback, acting in this\r\nrespect much worse than Marcellus, or rather proving that Marcellus was\r\na man of extraordinary mildness and generosity of temper, as is shown in\r\nhis Life.\r\n\r\nXXIII. Hannibal is said to have been hastening to relieve Tarentum, and\r\nto have been within five miles of it when it was taken. He said aloud:\r\n\"So then, the Romans also have a Hannibal; we have lost Tarentum just as\r\nwe gained it.\" Moreover in private he acknowledged to his friends that\r\nhe had long seen that it was very difficult, and now thought it\r\nimpossible for them to conquer Italy under existing circumstances.\r\n\r\nFabius enjoyed a second triumph for this success, which was more\r\nglorious than his first. He had contended with Hannibal and easily\r\nbaffled all his attempts just as a good wrestler disengages himself with\r\nease from the clutches of an antagonist whose strength is beginning to\r\nfail him; for Hannibal's army was no longer what it had been, being\r\npartly corrupted by luxury and plunder, and partly also worn out by\r\nunremitting toils and battles.\r\n\r\nOne Marcus Livius had been in command of Tarentum when Hannibal obtained\r\npossession of it. In spite of this, he held the citadel, from which he\r\ncould not be dislodged, until Tarentum was recaptured by the Romans.\r\nThis man was vexed at the honours paid to Fabius, and once, in a\r\ntransport of envy and vain glory, he said before the Senate that he, not\r\nFabius, was the real author of the recapture of the town. Fabius with a\r\nsmile answered: \"Very true; for if you had not lost the place, I could\r\nnever have recaptured it.\"\r\n\r\nXXIV. The Romans, among many other marks of respect for Fabius, elected\r\nhis son consul. When he had entered on this office and was making some\r\narrangements for the conduct of the war, his father, either because of\r\nhis age and infirmities or else intending to try his son, mounted on\r\nhorseback and rode towards him through the crowd of bystanders. The\r\nyoung man seeing him at a distance would not endure this slight, but\r\nsent a lictor to bid his father dismount and come on foot, if he wanted\r\nanything of the consul. Those present were vexed at this order, and\r\nlooked on Fabius in silence, as if they thought that he was unworthily\r\ntreated, considering his great reputation: but he himself instantly\r\nalighted, ran to his son, and embracing him, said: \"You both think and\r\nact rightly, my son; for you know whom you command, and how great an\r\noffice you hold. Thus it was that we and our ancestors made Rome great,\r\nby thinking less of our parents and of our children than of the glory of\r\nour country.\" It is even said to be true that the great grandfather of\r\nFabius, although he had been consul five times, had finished several\r\ncampaigns with splendid triumphs, and was one of the most illustrious\r\nmen in Rome, yet acted as lieutenant to his son when consul in the\r\nfield, and that in the subsequent triumph the son drove into Rome in a\r\nchariot and four, while he with the other officers followed him on\r\nhorseback, glorying in the fact that although he was his son's master,\r\nand although he was and was accounted the first citizen in Rome, yet he\r\nsubmitted himself to the laws and the chief magistrate. Nor did he\r\ndeserve admiration for this alone.\r\n\r\nFabius had the misfortune to lose his son, and this he bore with\r\nfortitude, as became a man of sense and an excellent parent. He himself\r\npronounced the funeral oration which is always spoken by some relative\r\non the deaths of illustrious men, and afterwards he wrote a copy of his\r\nspeech and distributed it to his friends.\r\n\r\nXXV. Cornelius Scipio meanwhile had been sent to Spain, where he had\r\ndefeated the Carthaginians in many battles and driven them out of the\r\ncountry, and had also overcome many tribes, taken many cities, and done\r\nglorious deeds for Rome. On his return he was received with great honour\r\nand respect, and, feeling that the people expected some extraordinary\r\nexploit from him, he decided that it was too tame a proceeding to fight\r\nHannibal in Italy, and determined to pour troops into Africa, attack\r\nCarthage, and transfer the theatre of war from Italy to that country. He\r\nbent all his energies to persuade the people to approve of this project,\r\nbut was violently opposed by Fabius, who spread great alarm through the\r\ncity, pointing out that it was being exposed to great danger by a\r\nreckless young man, and endeavouring by every means in his power to\r\nprevent the Romans from adopting Scipio's plan. He carried his point\r\nwith the Senate, but the people believed that he was envious of Scipio's\r\nprosperity and desired to check him, because he feared that if he did\r\ngain some signal success, and either put an end to the war altogether or\r\nremove it from Italy, he himself might be thought a feeble and dilatory\r\ngeneral for not having finished the war in so many campaigns.\r\n\r\nIt appears that at first Fabius opposed him on grounds of prudence and\r\ncaution, really fearing the dangers of his project, but that the contest\r\ngradually became a personal one, and he was moved by feelings of\r\njealousy to hinder the rise of Scipio; for he tried to induce Crassus,\r\nScipio's colleague, not to give up the province of Africa to Scipio, but\r\nif the expedition were determined on, to go thither himself, and he\r\nprevented his being supplied with funds for the campaign. Scipio being\r\nthus compelled to raise funds himself, obtained them from the cities in\r\nEtruria which were devoted to his interests. Crassus likewise was not\r\ninclined to quarrel with him, and was also obliged to remain in Italy by\r\nhis office of Pontifex Maximus.\r\n\r\nXXVI. Fabius now tried another method to oppose Scipio. He dissuaded the\r\nyouth of the city from taking service with him by continually\r\nvociferating in all public meetings that Scipio not only was himself\r\nrunning away from Hannibal, but also was about to take all the remaining\r\nforces of Italy out of the country with him, deluding the young men\r\nwith vain hopes, and so persuading them to leave their parents and\r\nwives, and their city too, while a victorious and invincible enemy was\r\nat its very gates. By these representations he alarmed the Romans, who\r\ndecreed that Scipio should only use the troops in Sicily, and three\r\nhundred of the best men of his Spanish army. In this transaction Fabius\r\nseems to have acted according to the dictates of his own cautious\r\ndisposition.\r\n\r\nHowever, when Scipio crossed over into Africa, news came to Rome at once\r\nof great and glorious exploits performed and great battles won. As\r\nsubstantial proof of these there came many trophies of war, and the king\r\nof Numidia as a captive. Two camps were burned and destroyed, with great\r\nslaughter of men, and loss of horses and war material in the flames.\r\nEmbassies also were sent to Hannibal from Carthage, begging him in\r\npiteous terms to abandon his fruitless hopes in Italy and come home to\r\nhelp them, while in Rome the name of Scipio was in every man's mouth\r\nbecause of his successes. At this period Fabius proposed that a\r\nsuccessor to Scipio should be sent out, without having any reason to\r\nallege for it except the old proverb that it is dangerous to entrust\r\nsuch important operations to the luck of one man, because it is hard for\r\nthe same man always to be lucky. This proposal of his offended most of\r\nhis countrymen, who thought him a peevish and malignant old man, or else\r\nthat he was timid and spiritless from old age, and excessively terrified\r\nat Hannibal; for, even when Hannibal quitted Italy and withdrew his\r\nforces, Fabius would not permit the joy of his countrymen to be unmixed\r\nwith alarm, as he informed them that now the fortunes of Rome were in a\r\nmore critical situation than ever, because Hannibal would be much more\r\nto be dreaded in Africa under the walls of Carthage itself, where he\r\nwould lead an army, yet reeking with the blood of many Roman dictators,\r\nconsuls and generals, to attack Scipio. By these words the city was\r\nagain filled with terror, and although the war had been removed to\r\nAfrica yet its alarms seemed to have come nearer to Rome.\r\n\r\nXXVII. However Scipio, after no long time, defeated Hannibal in a\r\npitched battle and crushed the pride of Carthage under foot. He gave\r\nthe Romans the enjoyment of a success beyond their hopes, and truly\r\n\r\n    \"Restored the city, shaken by the storm.\"\r\n\r\nFabius Maximus did not survive till the end of the war, nor did he live\r\nto hear of Hannibal's defeat, or see the glorious and lasting prosperity\r\nof his country, for about the time when Hannibal left Italy he fell sick\r\nand died.\r\n\r\nThe Thebans, we are told, buried Epameinondas at the public expense,\r\nbecause he died so poor that they say nothing was found in his house\r\nexcept an iron spit. Fabius was not honoured by the Romans with a\r\nfuneral at the public expense, yet every citizen contributed the\r\nsmallest Roman coin towards the expenses, not that he needed the money,\r\nbut because they buried him as the father of the people, so that in his\r\ndeath he received the honourable respect which he had deserved in his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF PERIKLES AND FABIUS MAXIMUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Such is the story of these men's lives. As they both gave many proofs\r\nof ability in war and politics, let us first turn our attention to their\r\nwarlike exploits. And here we must notice that Perikles found the\r\nAthenian people at the height of their power and prosperity, so that\r\nfrom the flourishing condition of the State it could scarcely meet with\r\nany great disaster, whereas Fabius performed his great services to Rome\r\nwhen it was in the last extremity of danger, and did not merely, like\r\nPerikles, confirm the prosperity of his country, but greatly improved\r\nit, having found it in a lamentable condition. Moreover, the successes\r\nof Kimon, the victories of Myronides and Leokrates, and the many\r\nachievements of Tolmides rather gave Perikles when in chief command an\r\noccasion for public rejoicing and festivity, than any opportunity for\r\neither conquests abroad or defensive wars at home. Fabius, on the other\r\nhand, had before his eyes the spectacle of many defeats and routs of\r\nRoman armies, of many consuls and generals fallen in battle, of lakes,\r\nplains and forests filled with the bodies of the slain, and of rivers\r\nrunning with blood. Yet with his mature and unbending intellect he\r\nundertook to extricate Rome from these dangers, and as it were by his\r\nown strength alone supported the State, so that it was not utterly\r\noverwhelmed by these terrible disasters. Nevertheless it would appear\r\nnot to be so hard a task to manage a State in adversity, when it is\r\nhumble and is compelled by its misfortunes to obey wise counsellors, as\r\nit is to check and bridle a people excited and arrogant with good\r\nfortune, which was especially the case with Perikles and the Athenians.\r\nOn the other hand, considering the terrible nature of the blows which\r\nhad fallen on the Romans, Fabius must have been a great and\r\nstrong-minded man not to be disconcerted by them, but still to be able\r\nto carry out the policy upon which he had determined.\r\n\r\nII. We may set the capture of Samos by Perikles against the retaking of\r\nTarentum by Fabius, and also the conquest of Euboea by the one against\r\nthat of the Campanian cities by the other, though Capua itself was\r\nrecovered by the consuls, Fulvius and Appius. Fabius seems never to have\r\nfought a pitched battle, except that one which gained him his first\r\ntriumph, while Perikles set up nine trophies for victories by sea and\r\nland. But again, there is no action of Perikles which can be compared to\r\nthat of Fabius when he snatched away Minucius from the grasp of\r\nHannibal, and saved an entire Roman army from destruction. That was an\r\nexploit glorious for the courage, generalship, and kindness of heart\r\ndisplayed by Fabius; but, on the other hand Perikles, made no such\r\nblunder as did Fabius, when out-generalled by Hannibal with the cattle.\r\nHere, although Fabius caught his enemy in a defile which he had entered\r\nby chance, yet he let him escape by night, and next day found his tardy\r\nmovements outstripped, and himself defeated by the man whom he had just\r\nbefore so completely cut off. If it be the part of a good general, not\r\nmerely to deal with the present, but to make conjectures about the\r\nfuture, we may remark that the Peloponnesian war ended just as Perikles\r\nhad foretold, for the Athenians frittered away their strength; whereas\r\nthe Romans, contrary to the expectation of Fabius, by sending Scipio to\r\nattack Carthage gained a complete victory, not by chance, but by the\r\nskill of their general and the courage of their troops, who overthrew\r\nthe enemy in a pitched battle. Thus the one was proved to be right by\r\nthe misfortunes of his country, and the other proved to be wrong by its\r\nsuccess, indeed it is just as much a fault in a general to receive a\r\ncheck from want of foresight as to let slip an opportunity through\r\ndiffidence; and both these failings, excess of confidence and want of\r\nconfidence, are common to all except the most consummate generals. Thus\r\nmuch for their military talents.\r\n\r\nIII. In political matters, the Peloponnesian war is a great blot upon\r\nthe fame of Perikles; for it is said to have been caused by his refusal\r\nto yield the least point to the Lacedaemonians. I do not imagine,\r\nhowever, that Fabius Maximus would have yielded anything to the\r\nCarthaginians, but would have bravely risked any danger in defence of\r\nthe Roman Empire. The kind treatment of Minucius by Fabius and his\r\nmildness of character contrast very favourably with the bitter party\r\nfeud of Perikles with Kimon and Thucydides, who were men of good birth,\r\nand belonging to the conservative party, and whom Perikles drove into\r\nexile by the ostracism. Then, too, the power of Perikles was much\r\ngreater than that of Fabius. Perikles would not permit the State to\r\nsuffer disaster because of the bad management of her generals. One of\r\nthem alone, Tolmides, succeeded in having his own way, against the\r\nwishes of Perikles, and perished in an attack on the Boeotians, while\r\nall the rest, because of his immense influence and power, submitted\r\nthemselves to his authority and regulated their proceedings by his\r\nideas. Whereas Fabius, although he could avoid any error in managing his\r\nown army, was thwarted by his being powerless to control the movements\r\nof other generals.\r\n\r\nFor the Romans would not have suffered so many defeats if Fabius had\r\nenjoyed the same power that Perikles did in Athens. As to their\r\ngenerosity with regard to money, the one was remarkable for never\r\nreceiving bribes, while the other spent much on ransoming prisoners at\r\nhis own expense; although this was not much above six talents, while it\r\nis hard for any one to tell the amount of money which Perikles might\r\nhave taken from foreign princes and Greek allied states, all of which he\r\nrefused and kept his hands clean. As to the great public works, the\r\nconstruction of the temples, and of the public buildings with which\r\nPerikles adorned Athens, the whole of the edifices in Rome together,\r\nbefore the time of the emperors, are not worthy to be compared to them,\r\nfor they far surpassed them both in largeness of scale and in beauty of\r\ndesign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF ALKIBIADES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The pedigree of Alkibiades is said to begin with Eurysakes the son of\r\nAjax, while on the mother's side he descended from Alkmaeon, being the\r\nson of Deinomache, the daughter of Megakles. His father Kleinias fought\r\nbravely at Artemisium in a trireme fitted out at his own expense, and\r\nsubsequently fell fighting the Boeotians, in the battle of Koronea.\r\nAlkibiades after this was entrusted to Perikles and Ariphron, the two\r\nsons of Xanthippus, who acted as his guardians because they were the\r\nnext of kin. It has been well remarked that the friendship of Sokrates\r\nfor him did not a little to increase his fame, seeing that Nikias,\r\nDemosthenes, Lamakus, Phormio, Thrasybulus, and Theramenes, were all men\r\nof mark in his lifetime, and yet we do not know the name of the mother\r\nof any one of them, while we know the name even of the nurse of\r\nAlkibiades, who was a Laconian, named Amykla, and that of Zopyrus, his\r\n_paedagogus_, one of which pieces of information we owe to Antisthenes,\r\nand the other to Plato. As to the beauty of Alkibiades, it is not\r\nnecessary to say anything except that it was equally fascinating when he\r\nwas a boy, a youth, and a man. The saying of Euripides, that all\r\nbeauties have a beautiful autumn of their charms, is not universally\r\ntrue, but it was so in the case of Alkibiades and of a few other persons\r\nbecause of the symmetry and vigour of their frames. Even his lisp is\r\nsaid to have added a charm to his speech, and to have made his talk more\r\npersuasive. His lisp is mentioned by Aristophanes in the verses in which\r\nhe satirises Theorus, in which Alkibiades calls him Theolus, for he\r\npronounced the letter _r_ like _l_. Archippus also gives a sneering\r\naccount of the son of Alkibiades, who, he said, swaggered in his walk,\r\ntrailing his cloak, that he might look as like his father as possible,\r\nand\r\n\r\n    \"Bends his affected neck, and lisping speaks.\"\r\n\r\nII. His character, in the course of his varied and brilliant career,\r\ndeveloped many strange inconsistencies and contradictions. Emulation and\r\nlove of distinction were the most prominent of his many violent\r\npassions, as is clear from the anecdotes of his childhood. Once when\r\nhard pressed in wrestling, rather than fall, he began to bite his\r\nopponent's hands. The other let go his hold, and said, \"You bite,\r\nAlkibiades, like a woman.\" \"No,\" said he, \"like a lion.\" While yet a\r\nchild, he was playing at knucklebones with other boys in a narrow\r\nstreet, and when his turn came to throw, a loaded waggon was passing. He\r\nat first ordered the driver to stop his team because his throw was to\r\ntake place directly in the path of the waggon. Then as the boor who was\r\ndriving would not stop, the other children made way; but Alkibiades\r\nflung himself down on his face directly in front of the horses, and bade\r\nhim drive on at his peril. The man, in alarm, now stopped his horses,\r\nand the others were terrified and ran up to him.\r\n\r\nIn learning he was fairly obedient to all his teachers, except in\r\nplaying the flute, which he refused to do, declaring that it was unfit\r\nfor a gentleman. He said that playing on the harp or lyre did not\r\ndisfigure the face, but that when a man was blowing at a flute, his own\r\nfriends could scarcely recognise him. Besides, the lyre accompanies the\r\nvoice of the performer, while the flute takes all the breath of the\r\nplayer and prevents him even from speaking. \"Let the children of the\r\nThebans,\" he used to say, \"learn to play the flute, for they know not\r\nhow to speak; but we Athenians according to tradition have the goddess\r\nAthene (Minerva) for our patroness, and Apollo for our tutelary\r\ndivinity; and of these the first threw away the flute in disgust, and\r\nthe other actually flayed the flute player Marsyas.\" With such talk as\r\nthis, between jest and earnest, Alkibiades gave up flute-playing\r\nhimself, and induced his friends to do so, for all the youth of Athens\r\nsoon heard and approved of Alkibiades's derision of the flute and those\r\nwho learned it. In consequence of this the flute went entirely out of\r\nfashion, and was regarded with contempt.\r\n\r\nIII. In Antiphon's scandalous chronicle, we read that Alkibiades once\r\nran away from home to the house of one of his admirers.\r\n\r\nAriphron, his other guardian, proposed to have him cried; but Perikles\r\nforbade it, saying that, if he was dead, he would only be found one day\r\nsooner because of it, while if he was safe, he would be disgraced for\r\nlife. Antiphon also tells us that he killed one of his servants by\r\nstriking him with a club, at the gymnasium of Sibyrtus. But perhaps we\r\nought not to believe these stories, which were written by an enemy with\r\nthe avowed purpose of defaming his character.\r\n\r\nIV. His youthful beauty soon caused him to be surrounded with noble\r\nadmirers, but the regard of Sokrates for him is a great proof of his\r\nnatural goodness of disposition, which that philosopher could discern in\r\nhim, but which he feared would wither away like a faded flower before\r\nthe temptations of wealth and position, and the mass of sycophants by\r\nwhom he was soon beset. For no one ever was so enclosed and enveloped in\r\nthe good things of this life as Alkibiades, so that no breath of\r\ncriticism or free speech could ever reach him. Yet, with all these\r\nflatterers about him, trying to prevent his ever hearing a word of\r\nwholesome advice or reproof, he was led by his own goodness of heart to\r\npay special attention to Sokrates, to whom he attached himself in\r\npreference to all his rich and fashionable admirers.\r\n\r\nHe soon became intimate with Sokrates, and when he discovered that this\r\nman did not wish to caress and admire him, but to expose his ignorance,\r\nsearch out his faults, and bring down his vain unreasoning conceit, he\r\nthen\r\n\r\n    \"Let fall his feathers like a craven cock.\"\r\n\r\nHe considered that the conversation of Sokrates was really a divine\r\ninstrument for the discipline and education of youth; and thus learning\r\nto despise himself, and to admire his friend, charmed with his good\r\nnature, and full of reverence for his virtues, he became insensibly in\r\nlove with him, though not as the world loveth; so that all men were\r\nastonished to see him dining with Sokrates, wrestling with him, and\r\nsharing his tent, while he treated all his other admirers with harshness\r\nand some even with insolence, as in the case of Anytus the son of\r\nAnthemion. This man, who was an admirer of Alkibiades, was entertaining\r\na party of friends, and asked him to come. Alkibiades refused the\r\ninvitation, but got drunk that night at a riotous party at his own\r\nhouse, in which state he proceeded in a disorderly procession to Anytus.\r\nHere he looked into the room where the guests were, and seeing the\r\ntables covered with gold and silver drinking-cups, ordered his slaves to\r\ncarry away half of them, and then, without deigning to enter the room,\r\nwent home again. Anytus' guests were vexed at this, and complained of\r\nhis being so arrogantly and outrageously treated. \"Say rather,\r\nconsiderately,\" answered Anytus, \"for although he might have taken them\r\nall, yet he has left us the half of them.\"\r\n\r\nV. In this same way he used to treat his other admirers, with the\r\nexception, it is said, of one of the resident aliens,[A] a man of small\r\nmeans who sold all that he had and carried the money, amounting to about\r\na hundred _staters_, to Alkibiades, begging him to accept it. Alkibiades\r\nlaughed at him, and invited him to dinner. After dinner he gave him back\r\nhis money, and ordered him next day to go and overbid those who were\r\nabout to bid for the office of farmer of the taxes. The poor man begged\r\nto be excused, because the price was several talents, but Alkibiades\r\nthreatened to have him beaten if he did not do so, for he had some\r\nprivate grudge of his own against the farmers of the taxes. Accordingly\r\nthe alien went next morning early into the market-place and bid a\r\ntalent. The tax farmers now clustered round him angrily, bidding him\r\nname some one as security, imagining that he would not be able to find\r\none. The poor man was now in great trouble and was about to steal away,\r\nwhen Alkibiades, who was at some distance, called out to the presiding\r\nmagistrates, \"Write down my name. I am his friend, and I will be surety\r\nfor him.\" On hearing this, the tax farmers were greatly embarrassed, for\r\ntheir habit was to pay the rent of each year with the proceeds of the\r\nnext, and they saw no way of doing so in this instance. Consequently\r\nthey begged the man to desist from bidding, and offered him money.\r\nAlkibiades would not permit him to take less than a talent, and when\r\nthis was given him he let him go. This was the way in which he did him a\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: [Greek: metoikikhon].]\r\n\r\nVI. The love of Sokrates, though he had many rivals, yet overpowered\r\nthem all, for his words touched the heart of Alkibiades and moved him to\r\ntears. Sometimes his flatterers would bribe him by the offer of some\r\npleasure, to which he would yield and slip away from Sokrates, but he\r\nwas then pursued like a fugitive slave by the latter, of whom he stood\r\nin awe, though he treated every one else with insolence and contempt.\r\nKleanthes used to say that Sokrates's only hold upon him was through his\r\nears, while he scorned to meddle with the rest of his body. And indeed\r\nAlkibiades was very prone to pleasure, as one would gather from what\r\nThucydides says on the subject. Those too who played on his vanity and\r\nlove of distinction induced him to embark on vast projects before he was\r\nripe for them, assuring him that as soon as he began to take a leading\r\npart in politics, he would not only eclipse all the rest of the generals\r\nand orators, but would even surpass Perikles in power and renown. But\r\njust as iron which has been softened in the fire is again hardened by\r\ncold, and under its influence contracts its expanded particles, so did\r\nSokrates, when he found Alkibiades puffed up by vain and empty conceit,\r\nbring him down to his proper level by his conversation, rendering him\r\nhumble minded by pointing out to him his many deficiencies.\r\n\r\nVII. After he had finished his education, he went into a school, and\r\nasked the master for a volume of Homer. When the master said that he\r\npossessed none of Homer's writings, he struck him with his fist, and\r\nleft him. Another schoolmaster told him that he had a copy of Homer\r\ncorrected by himself. \"Do you,\" asked he, \"you who are able to correct\r\nHomer, teach boys to read! One would think that you could instruct men.\"\r\n\r\nOne day he wished to speak to Perikles, and came to his house. Hearing\r\nthat he was not at leisure, but was engaged in considering how he was to\r\ngive in his accounts to the Athenians, Alkibiades, as he went away,\r\nsaid, \"It would be better if he considered how to avoid giving in any\r\naccounts at all to the Athenians.\"\r\n\r\nWhile yet a lad he served in the campaign of Potidaea, where he shared\r\nthe tent of Sokrates, and took his place next him in the ranks. In an\r\nobstinate engagement they both showed great courage, and when Alkibiades\r\nwas wounded and fell to the ground, Sokrates stood in front of him,\r\ndefending him, and so saved his life and arms from the enemy. Properly,\r\ntherefore, the prize for valour belonged to Sokrates; but when the\r\ngenerals appeared anxious to bestow it upon Alkibiades because of his\r\ngreat reputation, Sokrates, who wished to encourage his love for glory,\r\nwas the first to give his testimony in his favour, and to call upon them\r\nto crown him as victor and to give him the suit of armour which was the\r\nprize. And also at the battle of Delium, when the Athenians were routed,\r\nAlkibiades, who was on horseback, when he saw Sokrates retreating on\r\nfoot with a few others, would not ride on, but stayed by him and\r\ndefended him, though the enemy were pressing them and cutting off many\r\nof them. These things, however, happened afterwards.\r\n\r\nVIII. He once struck Hipponikus, the father of Kallias, a man of great\r\nwealth and noble birth, a blow with his fist, not being moved to it by\r\nanger, or any dispute, but having agreed previously with his friends to\r\ndo so for a joke. When every one in the city cried out at his indecent\r\nand arrogant conduct, Alkibiades next morning at daybreak came to the\r\nhouse of Hipponikus, knocked, and came to him. Here he threw off his\r\ncloak, and offered him his body, bidding him flog him and punish him for\r\nwhat he had done. Hipponikus, however, pardoned him, and they became\r\nfriends, so much so that Hipponikus chose him for the husband of his\r\ndaughter Hipparete. Some writers say that not Hipponikus but Kallias his\r\nson gave Hipparete to Alkibiades to wife, with a dowry of ten talents,\r\nand that when her first child was born Alkibiades demanded and received\r\nten more talents, as if he had made a previous agreement to that effect.\r\nUpon this Kallias, fearing that Alkibiades might plot against his life,\r\ngave public notice in the assembly that if he died childless, he would\r\nleave his house and all his property to the State.\r\n\r\nHipparete was a quiet and loving wife, but was so constantly insulted by\r\nher husband's amours with foreign and Athenian courtesans, that she at\r\nlength left his house and went to her brother's. Alkibiades took no heed\r\nof this, but continued in his debauchery.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary for her to deliver her petition for separation to the\r\nmagistrate with her own hand, and when she came to do so, Alkibiades\r\nlaid hold of her, and took her home with him through the market-place,\r\nno one daring to oppose him and take her from him. She lived with him\r\nuntil her death, which took place not long after Alkibiades sailed for\r\nEphesus. In this instance his violence does not seem to have been\r\naltogether lawless or without excuse, for the object of the law in\r\nmaking a wife appear in person in public seems to be that she may have\r\nan opportunity of meeting her husband and making up her quarrel with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIX. He had a dog of remarkable size and beauty, for which he had paid\r\nseventy minae. It had a very fine tail, which he cut off. When his\r\nfriends blamed him, and said that every one was sorry for the dog and\r\nangry with him for what he had done, he laughed and said, \"Then I have\r\nsucceeded; for I wish the Athenians to gossip about this, for fear they\r\nshould say something worse about me.\"\r\n\r\nX. It is said that his first public act was on the occasion of a\r\nvoluntary subscription for the State. He did not intend doing anything\r\nof the sort, but as he was passing he heard a great noise, and finding\r\nthat voluntary subscriptions were being made, went and subscribed. The\r\npeople cheered and applauded him, at which he was so much delighted as\r\nto forget a quail which he had in his cloak. When it escaped and ran\r\nabout bewildered, the Athenians applauded all the more, and many rose\r\nand chased it. It was caught by the pilot Antiochus, who restored it,\r\nand became one of Alkibiades's greatest friends. Starting with great\r\nadvantages from his noble birth, his wealth, his recognised bravery in\r\nbattle, and his many friends and relatives, he relied upon nothing so\r\nmuch as on his eloquence for making himself popular and influential. His\r\nrhetorical powers are borne witness to by the comic dramatists; and the\r\ngreatest of orators, Demosthenes, in his speech against Meidias, speaks\r\nof Alkibiades as being most eloquent, besides his other charms. If we\r\nare to believe Theophrastus, who has inquired more diligently into these\r\nvarious tales than any one else, Alkibiades excelled all men of his time\r\nin readiness of invention and resource. However, as he wished not merely\r\nto speak to the purpose, but also to clothe his thoughts in the most\r\nappropriate language, he did not always succeed in combining the two,\r\nand often hesitated and stopped, seeking for the right word, and not\r\ncontinuing his speech until it occurred to him.\r\n\r\nXI. He was renowned for his stud, and for the number of his racing\r\nchariots. No other person, king or commoner, ever entered seven\r\nfour-horse chariots for the race at Olympia except Alkibiades. His\r\nwinning the first, second, and fourth prizes with these, as Thucydides\r\ntells us, though Euripides says that he won the third also, excels in\r\nglory any other successes by other persons in these races. The poem of\r\nEuripides runs as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"Son of Kleinias, thee I sing,\r\n    In truth it is a noble thing,\r\n    First, second, and third place\r\n    To win in chariot race,\r\n    To hear the herald thrice thy name proclaim,\r\n    And thrice to bear away the olive crown of fame.\"\r\n\r\nXII. His success was rendered all the more conspicuous by the manner in\r\nwhich the various States vied with one another in showing him honour.\r\nEphesus pitched a magnificent tent for his accommodation, Chios\r\nfurnished his horses with provender, and himself with animals for\r\nsacrifice; and Lesbos supplied him with wine, and every thing else\r\nnecessary for giving great entertainments. Yet even at this brilliant\r\nperiod of his life he incurred discredit, either by his own fault or\r\nthrough the spite of his enemies. The story is that an Athenian named\r\nDiomedes, a respectable man and a friend of Alkibiades, was desirous of\r\nwinning a victory at Olympia. Hearing that there was a chariot and four\r\nwhich belonged to the city of Argos, and knowing that Alkibiades had\r\ngreat influence and many friends in that place, he persuaded him to buy\r\nthe chariot for him. Alkibiades, however, bought the chariot and entered\r\nit for the race as his own, leaving Diomedes to call upon heaven and\r\nearth to witness his ill-treatment. It appears that a trial took place\r\nabout this matter, and Isokrates wrote a speech about this chariot in\r\ndefence of the son of Alkibiades, in which Tisias, not Diomedes, is\r\nmentioned as the prosecutor.\r\n\r\nXIII. When, as a mere boy, Alkibiades plunged into political life, he at\r\nonce surpassed most of the statesmen of the age. His chief rivals were\r\nPhaeax, the son of Erasistratus, and Nikias, the son of Nikeratus, the\r\nlatter a man advanced in life, and bearing the reputation of being an\r\nexcellent general, while the former, like Alkibiades himself, was a\r\nyoung man of good family, just rising into notice, but inferior to him\r\nin many respects, particularly in oratory. Though affable and persuasive\r\nin private circles, he could not speak equally well in public, for he\r\nwas, as Eupolis says,\r\n\r\n    \"At conversation best of men, at public speaking worst.\"\r\n\r\nIn a certain attack on Alkibiades and Phaeax, we find, among other\r\ncharges, Alkibiades accused of using the gold and silver plate of the\r\ncity of Athens as his own for his daily use.\r\n\r\nThere was at Athens one Hyperbolus, of the township of Peirithois, whom\r\nThucydides mentions as a worthless man, and one who was constantly\r\nridiculed by the comic dramatists. From his utter disregard of what was\r\nsaid of him, and his carelessness for his honour, which, though it was\r\nmere shameless impudence and apathy, was thought by some to show\r\nfirmness and true courage, he was pleasing to no party, but frequently\r\nmade use of by the people when they wished to have a scurrilous attack\r\nmade upon those in power. At this time he was about to resort to the\r\nproceeding called ostracism, by which from time to time the Athenians\r\nforce into exile those citizens who are remarkable for influence and\r\npower, rather because they envy them than because they fear them.\r\n\r\nBut as it was clear that one of the three, Nikias, Phaeax, and\r\nAlkibiades, would be ostracised, Alkibiades combined their several\r\nparties, arranged matters with Nikias, and turned the ostracism against\r\nHyperbolus himself. Some say that it was not Nikias but Phaeax with whom\r\nAlkibiades joined interest, and that with the assistance of his\r\npolitical party he managed to expel Hyperbolus, who never expected any\r\nsuch treatment; for before that time this punishment had never been\r\nextended to low persons of no reputation, as Plato, the comic dramatist,\r\nsays in the lines where he mentions Hyperbolus:\r\n\r\n    \"Full worthy to be punished though he be,\r\n    Yet ostracism's not for such as he.\"\r\n\r\nWe have elsewhere given a fuller account of this affair.\r\n\r\nXIV. Alkibiades was dissatisfied at the respect shown for Nikias, both\r\nby enemies of the State and by the citizens of Athens. Alkibiades was\r\nthe proxenus[A] of the Lacedaemonians at Athens, and paid especial court\r\nto those Spartans who had been captured at Pylos; yet, when the\r\nLacedaemonians discovered that it was chiefly by Nikias's means that\r\nthey obtained peace, and recovered their prisoners, they were lavish of\r\ntheir attentions to him. The common phrase among the Greeks of that time\r\nwas that Perikles had begun the war, and Nikias had finished it; and the\r\npeace was usually called the peace of Nikias. Alkibiades, irritated\r\nbeyond measure at his rival's success, began to meditate how he could\r\ndestroy the existing treaty. He perceived that the Argives, hating and\r\nfearing Sparta, wished to break off from it, and he encouraged them by\r\nsecret assurances of an Athenian alliance, and also both by his agents\r\nand in person he urged the leading men not to give way to the\r\nLacedaemonians, or yield any points to them, but to turn to Athens, and\r\nawait their co-operation, for the Athenians, he said, already began to\r\nregret that they had made peace at all, and would soon break it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: An office resembling that of a modern consul for a foreign\r\nnation.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Lacedaemonians made an alliance with the Boeotians, and\r\ndelivered up Panaktus to the Athenians in a dismantled condition, not\r\nwith its walls standing, as they ought to have done, Alkibiades\r\nexasperated the rage of the Athenians by his speeches, and raised a\r\nclamour against Nikias by the plausible accusation that he, when\r\ngeneral, had hung back from capturing the enemy's forces which were cut\r\noff in the island of Sphakteria, and that when they had been captured by\r\nanother, he had released them and restored them to their homes, in order\r\nto gain the favour of the Lacedaemonians. And for all that, although he\r\nwas such a friend of the Lacedaemonians, he had not dissuaded them from\r\nforming alliances with Corinth and with the Boeotians, while he\r\nprevented the Athenians from becoming allies of any Greek State which\r\nmight wish it, if the step did not happen to please the Lacedaemonians.\r\n\r\nUpon this, while Nikias was smarting under these accusations,\r\nambassadors arrived from Lacedaemon with instructions to propose\r\nreasonable terms, and announcing that they came with full powers to\r\nconclude the negotiations for peace on an equitable basis. The Senate\r\nreceived them willingly, and next day they were to appear before the\r\npeople. Fearing that they would succeed, Alkibiades contrived to obtain\r\na private interview with them, in which he addressed them as follows:\r\n\"What is this that you do, men of Sparta! Do you not know that the\r\nSenate always treats those who appear before it in a kindly and\r\nreasonable manner, but the people are always full of pride and ambition?\r\nIf you say that you have plenary powers, they will bewilder you by their\r\nviolence and force great concessions from you. So come, cease this\r\nfolly, if you wish to negotiate with the Athenians in a moderate way,\r\nand not to be forced into conceding points against your will. Discuss\r\nall the points at issue, but do not say that you have full power to\r\ndecide them. I will do my best to assist you, as a friend to\r\nLacedaemon.\" After these words he confirmed his promise by an oath, and\r\nthus completely detached them from Nikias and left them trusting him\r\nonly, and admiring him as a man of remarkable sense and intelligence. On\r\nthe following day the people assembled, and the ambassadors appeared\r\nbefore them. When they were politely asked by Alkibiades in what\r\ncapacity they came, they said that they were not plenipotentiaries.\r\nImmediately upon this Alkibiades assailed them with furious invective,\r\nas though they, not he, were in the wrong, calling them faithless\r\nequivocators, who had not come either to speak or to do anything honest.\r\nThe Senate was vexed at its treatment, and the people were excessively\r\nenraged, while Nikias, who knew nothing of the trick, was astounded and\r\ncovered with confusion at the conduct of the ambassadors.\r\n\r\nXV. The Lacedaemonian alliance being put an end to by this means,\r\nAlkibiades, who was now elected one of the generals of Athens, at once\r\nformed an alliance with Argos, Elis and Mantinea. No one approved of the\r\nway in which he effected this, but still the result was very important,\r\nas it agitated all the States in Peloponnesus, and set them against one\r\nanother, brought so many men into line to fight the Lacedaemonians at\r\nthe battle of Mantinea, and removed the scene of conflict so far from\r\nAthens, that the Lacedaemonians could gain no great advantage by\r\nvictory, whereas if they failed, they would have to struggle for their\r\nvery existence. After this battle the select regiment at Argos, called\r\nthe \"Thousand,\" endeavoured to overthrow the government and establish\r\nthemselves as masters of the city; and with the assistance of the\r\nLacedaemonians they destroyed the constitution. But the people took up\r\narms again, and defeated the usurpers; and Alkibiades coming to their\r\naid, made the victory of the popular side more complete. He persuaded\r\nthe citizens to build long walls down to the sea, and to trust entirely\r\nto the Athenian naval forces for support. He even sent them carpenters\r\nand stonemasons from Athens, and showed great zeal on their behalf,\r\nwhich tended to increase his personal interest and power no less than\r\nthat of his country. He advised the people of Patrae also to join their\r\ncity to the sea by long walls; and when some one said to the people of\r\nPatrae, that the Athenians would swallow them up, he answered, \"Perhaps\r\nthey may, but it will be by degrees and beginning with the feet,\r\nwhereas the Lacedaemonians will seize them by the head and do it at\r\nonce.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, Alkibiades ever pressed the Athenians to establish their empire\r\nby land as well as by sea, reminding them of the oath which the young\r\nmen take in the Temple of Agraulos, and which it was their duty to\r\nconfirm by their deeds. This oath is, that they will regard wheat,\r\nbarley, vines and olives as the boundaries of Attica, by which it is\r\nhinted that they ought to make all cultivated and fruitful lands their\r\nown.\r\n\r\nXVI. In the midst of all this display of political ability, eloquence,\r\nand statesmanlike prudence, he lived a life of great luxury, debauchery,\r\nand profuse expenditure, swaggering through the market-place with his\r\nlong effeminate mantle trailing on the ground. He had the deck of his\r\ntrireme cut away, that he might sleep more comfortably, having his bed\r\nslung on girths instead of resting on the planks; and he carried a\r\nshield not emblazoned with the ancestral bearings of his family, but\r\nwith a Cupid wielding a thunderbolt. The leading men of Athens viewed\r\nhis conduct with disgust and apprehension, fearing his scornful and\r\noverbearing manner, as being nearly allied to the demeanour of a despot,\r\nwhile Aristophanes has expressed the feeling of the people towards him\r\nin the line,\r\n\r\n    \"They love, they hate, they cannot live without him.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again he alludes to him in a bitterer spirit in the verse:\r\n\r\n    \"A lion's cub 'tis best you should not rear,\r\n    For if you do, your master he'll appear.\"\r\n\r\nHis voluntary contributions of money to the State, his public\r\nexhibitions and services, and displays of munificence, which could not\r\nbe equalled in splendour, his noble birth, his persuasive speech, his\r\nstrength, beauty, and bravery, and all his other shining qualities,\r\ncombined to make the Athenians endure him, and always give his errors\r\nthe mildest names, calling them youthful escapades and honourable\r\nemulation. For example, he locked up Agatharchus the painter, and when\r\nhe had painted his house let him go with a present. He boxed Taurea's\r\nears because he was exhibiting shows in rivalry with him, and\r\ncontending with him for the prize. And he even took one of the captive\r\nMelian women for his mistress, and brought up a child which he had by\r\nher. This was thought to show his good nature; but this term cannot be\r\napplied to the slaughter of all the males above puberty in the island of\r\nMelos, which was done in accordance with a decree promoted by\r\nAlkibiades.\r\n\r\nWhen Aristophon painted the courtesan Nemea embracing Alkibiades, all\r\nmen eagerly crowded to see it; but older men were vexed at these things\r\ntoo, thinking them only fit for despots, and considering them to be open\r\nviolations of the laws. Indeed Archestratus spoke very much to the\r\npurpose when he said that Greece could not bear more than one\r\nAlkibiades. Once, when Alkibiades had made a successful speech in the\r\npublic assembly, and was being conducted home in triumph by his friends,\r\nTimon the misanthrope met him, and did not get out of his way, as he did\r\nto every one else, but came up to him and took him by the hand, saying,\r\n\"Go on, my boy, increase in glory; for your increase will bring ruin to\r\nall this crowd.\" Some laughed, some cursed him, but others took his\r\nwords to heart. So various were the opinions formed about Alkibiades,\r\nbecause of the inconsistency of his character.\r\n\r\nXVII. Even during the lifetime of Perikles, the Athenians had a\r\nhankering after Sicily, and after his death they endeavoured to obtain\r\npossession of it, by sending troops to the assistance of those cities\r\nwhich were oppressed by the Syracusans, and thus paving the way for a\r\ngreater armament. It was, however, Alkibiades who fanned their desires\r\ninto a flame, and who persuaded them to abandon these half-hearted\r\nattempts, to proceed with a great force to the island, and to endeavour\r\nto subdue it. He raised great expectations among the people, but his own\r\naspirations were far more entensive; for he regarded the conquest of\r\nSicily not merely as an end, but as a stepping-stone to greater things.\r\nWhile Nikias was dissuading the people from the attempt, on the ground\r\nthat it would be a difficult matter to capture the city of Syracuse,\r\nAlkibiades was dreaming of Carthage and Libya; and after these were\r\ngained, he meditated the conquest of Italy and of Peloponnesus,\r\nregarding Sicily as little more than a convenient magazine and place of\r\narms. He greatly excited the younger Athenians by his vast designs, and\r\nthey listened eagerly to the marvellous stories of the old who had\r\nserved in that country; so that many of them would spend their time\r\nsitting in the gymnasia and public seats, drawing sketches of the shape\r\nof the island of Sicily, and of the position of Libya and Carthage. It\r\nis said that Sokrates the philosopher, and Meton the astronomer, did not\r\nexpect that the state would gain any advantage from this expedition; the\r\nformer probably receiving a presentiment of disaster, as was his wont,\r\nfrom his familiar spirit. Meton either made calculations which led him\r\nto fear what was about to happen, or else gathered it from the art of\r\nprophecy. He feigned madness, and seizing a torch, attempted to set his\r\nhouse on fire. Some say that Meton made no pretence of madness, but that\r\nhe burned down his house one night, and next morning came and besought\r\nthe Athenians, after such a misfortune, to exempt his son from serving\r\nwith the expedition. Thus he deceived his fellow citizens and carried\r\nhis point.\r\n\r\nXVIII. Nikias, much against his will, was chosen to lead the expedition.\r\nHis unwillingness was in a great measure due to the fact that Alkibiades\r\nwas to act as his colleague; for the Athenians thought that the war\r\nwould be conducted better if the rashness of Alkibiades was tempered by\r\nthe prudence of Nikias, because the third general, Lamachus, although\r\nadvanced in years, yet had the reputation of being no less daring and\r\nreckless a soldier than Alkibiades himself.\r\n\r\nWhen the public assembly were debating about the number of the troops\r\nand the preparation for the armament, Nikias made another attempt to\r\noppose the whole measure and to put a stop to the war. Alkibiades,\r\nhowever, took the other side and carried all before him. The orator\r\nDemostratus moved, that the generals should be empowered to demand\r\nwhatever stores and war material they pleased, and have absolute power\r\nto carry on the war at their own discretion. This was agreed to by the\r\npeople, and all was ready for setting sail, when unlucky omens occurred.\r\nThe festival of Adonis took place at that very time, and during it the\r\nwomen carry about in many parts of the city figures dressed like corpses\r\ngoing to be buried, and imitate the ceremony of a funeral by tearing\r\ntheir hair and singing dirges. And besides this, the mutilation of the\r\nHermae in one night, when all of them had their faces disfigured,\r\ndisturbed many even of those who, as a rule, despised such things. A\r\nstory was put about that the Corinthians, of whom the Syracusans were a\r\ncolony, had done it, hoping that such an evil omen might make the\r\nAthenians either postpone or give up their expedition. But the people\r\npaid no heed to this insinuation, and still less to those who argued\r\nthat there was no omen in the matter at all, but that it was the work of\r\nextravagant young men after their wine. They regarded the incident with\r\nfeelings of rage and fear, imagining that it proved the existence of an\r\norganised plot aimed at greater matters. Both the Senate and the General\r\nAssembly met several times during the next few days, and inquired\r\nsharply into every thing that could throw any light upon it.\r\n\r\nXIX. During this time, Androkles, a popular speaker, brought forward\r\nseveral slaves and resident aliens, who charged Alkibiades and his\r\nfriends with mutilating certain other statues, and with parodying the\r\nceremonies of initiation to the sacred mysteries when in their cups.\r\nThey said that the part of the Herald was taken by Theodorus, that of\r\nthe Torch-bearer by Polytion, and that of Hierophant by Alkibiades\r\nhimself, while the rest of the company were present and were initiated,\r\nand were addressed by them as Mysts, which means persons who have been\r\ninitiated into the mysteries. These are the charges which we find\r\nspecified in the indictment drawn against Alkibiades by Thessalus the\r\nson of Kimon, in which he accuses Alkibiades of sacrilege against the\r\ntwo goddesses, Demeter (Ceres) and Proserpine. The people now became\r\nvery much enraged with Alkibiades, and were still more exasperated by\r\nhis personal enemy Androkles. Alkibiades was at first alarmed, but soon\r\nperceived that all the sailors of the fleet about to sail to Sicily\r\nwere on his side, as were also the soldiers. A body of a thousand\r\nArgives and Mantineans also were heard to say that they were going to\r\ncross the seas and fight in a distant land all for the sake of\r\nAlkibiades, and that if he did not meet with fair play, they would at\r\nonce desert. Encouraged by this, he appeared at the appointed time to\r\ndefend himself, which disconcerted and disheartened his enemies, who\r\nfeared that the people might deal leniently with him because they\r\nrequired his services. Matters being in this posture, they prevailed\r\nupon some of the orators who were not known to be enemies to Alkibiades,\r\nbut who hated him nevertheless, to move before the people that it was an\r\nabsurd proceeding for the irresponsible general of so great a force of\r\nAthenians and their allies to waste his time while the court was drawing\r\nlots for the jury, and filling water-clocks with water. \"Let him sail,\r\nand may good luck attend him, and when the war is finished let him\r\nreturn and speak in his defence, for the laws will be the same then as\r\nnow.\" Alkibiades saw clearly their malicious object in postponing his\r\ntrial, and said publicly that it was very hard to leave such accusations\r\nand slanders behind him, and to be sent out in command of a great\r\nexpedition with such a terrible fate hanging over him. If he could not\r\nprove his innocence, he ought to be put to death; and if he could clear\r\nhimself of these charges, it was only just that he should be enabled to\r\nattack the enemy with a light heart, without having to fear false\r\naccusers at home.\r\n\r\nXX. He did not, however, succeed in this, but was ordered to sail, and\r\nput to sea with his colleagues, having under their orders a fleet of\r\nnearly one hundred and forty triremes, five thousand one hundred\r\nheavy-armed troops, archers, slingers, and light-armed troops to the\r\nnumber of about thirteen hundred, and all other stores and provisions in\r\nproportion. After reaching Italy and capturing Rhegium, he gave his\r\nopinion as to the manner in which the war ought to be conducted; but as\r\nNikias opposed him and was joined by Lamachus, he sailed over to Sicily\r\nand induced the city of Catana to join them, but did nothing further,\r\nbecause he was sent for at once to return and stand his trial at Athens.\r\nAt first, as we have stated, Alkibiades was only vaguely suspected, and\r\nonly the testimony of slaves and resident aliens could be obtained\r\nagainst him; but afterwards, during his absence, his enemies had worked\r\nhard to get up a case against him, and connected his sacrilegious\r\nconduct about the mysteries with the mutilation of the Hermae, which\r\nthey argued were all the work of one body of conspirators, bent upon\r\nrevolution and the destruction of the existing form of government. All\r\nthose who were in any degree implicated were cast into prison without a\r\ntrial, and they were much vexed they had not immediately brought\r\nAlkibiades to trial and obtained judgment against him on such grave\r\ncharges as these. Any of his friends, relations, or acquaintances who\r\nfell into their hands received very harsh treatment.\r\n\r\nThucydides has omitted the names of those who impeached him, but others\r\ngive their names as Diokleides and Teukrus, among whom is Phrynichus the\r\ncomic dramatist, who writes as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"And, dearest Hermes, do not fall\r\n    And break your head; and, worst of all,\r\n    To some new Diokleides show the way,\r\n    By slander base to swear men's lives away.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again Hermes says:\r\n\r\n    \"I will not fall. I will not for my pains\r\n    Let Teukrus fatten on informers' gains.\"\r\n\r\nThough really the informers brought no decided evidence forward for any\r\nimportant charge, one of them, when asked how he recognised the faces of\r\nthe statue-breakers, answered that he saw them by the light of the moon:\r\na signal falsehood, because it was done on the night of the new moon.\r\nThis answer made the more thoughtful citizens unwilling to press the\r\ncharge, but had no effect whatever on the people, who were as eager as\r\never, and continued to cast into prison any man who might be informed\r\nagainst.\r\n\r\nXXI. One of those who was imprisoned was the orator Andokides, whom\r\nHellanikus, the historian, reckons as a descendant of Odysseus\r\n(Ulysses). Andokides was thought to be a man of aristocratic and\r\nantipopular sentiments, and what made him particularly suspected of\r\nhaving taken part in the statue-breaking, was that the large statue of\r\nHermes, near his house, the gift of the tribe Aegeis, was one of the\r\nvery few which remained unbroken. Wherefore even at the present day it\r\nis called the Hermes of Andokides, and everyone speaks of it by that\r\nname in spite of the inscription on it.\r\n\r\nIt happened that Andokides, while in custody, formed an acquaintance and\r\nfriendship for one of the other persons who were imprisoned on the same\r\ncharge, a man of the name of Timaeus, of inferior birth and position to\r\nhimself, but much cleverer and more courageous. This man persuaded\r\nAndokides to inform against himself and some few others, because, by a\r\ndecree of the people, any one who acted as informer was to be given a\r\nfree pardon, whereas no one could count upon the results of a trial,\r\nwhich the more prominent citizens had especial reasons for dreading. He\r\npointed out that it was better to save his life by a lie than to be put\r\nto death with infamy as if he was really guilty; moreover, looking at\r\nthe whole affair, it was best to sacrifice a few persons of doubtful\r\ncharacter to the fury of the people, and thereby to save many good men\r\nfrom becoming its victims. Andokides was convinced by these arguments of\r\nTimaeus, and by informing against himself and some others obtained a\r\npardon for himself, while all those whose names he mentioned were put to\r\ndeath, except such as had fled the country.\r\n\r\nTo procure greater credit to his information, Andokides even accused his\r\nown servants. However, the people did not abate their rage, but, ceasing\r\nto take any further interest in the statue-breakers, they turned\r\nsavagely against Alkibiades. Finally, they despatched the Salaminian\r\ntrireme after him, ingeniously ordering its officers not to use any\r\npersonal violence, but to speak him fair and bid him return to stand his\r\ntrial and set himself right with the people.\r\n\r\nThey were afraid of an outbreak, or even of a mutiny in the army in\r\nSicily, which Alkibiades could have raised with the greatest ease, if he\r\nhad wished to do so. Indeed, the soldiers became disheartened when he\r\nleft them, and looked forward to long delays and periods of dull\r\ninaction under Nikias's command, now that he who used to spur matters\r\non was gone. Lamachus, indeed, was a brave and skilful soldier, but his\r\npoverty prevented his opinions from carrying their due weight.\r\n\r\nXXII. Alkibiades the moment he sailed away lost Messina for the\r\nAthenians. There was a party in that city ready to deliver it up, which\r\nhe knew well, and by disclosing their intentions to the Syracusan party\r\nhe effectually ruined the plot. At Thurii he landed, and concealed\r\nhimself so that he could not be found. When one of his friends said to\r\nhim, \"Alkibiades, do you not trust your native country?\" He answered,\r\n\"Yes, in other matters; but when my life is at stake I would not trust\r\nmy own mother, for fear that she might mistake a black bean for a white\r\none.\" Afterwards hearing that the Athenians had condemned him to death,\r\nhe said, \"I will show them that I am still alive.\"\r\n\r\nThe indictment against him is framed thus:\r\n\r\n\"Thessalus, the son of Kimon, of the township of Lakia, accuses\r\nAlkibiades, the son of Kleinias, of the township of the Skambonidae, of\r\nsacrilege against the two goddesses, Demeter and Kora, by parodying the\r\nsacred mysteries and giving a representation of them in his own house,\r\nwearing himself such a robe as the Hierophant does when he shows the\r\nholy things, and calling himself the Hierophant, Poulytion, the\r\nTorch-bearer, Theodorus, of the township of Phegaea, the Herald, and\r\naddressing the rest of the company as Mysts and Epopts (Initiates and\r\nNovices), contrary to the rules and ceremonies established by the\r\nEumolpidae, and Kerykes, and the priests of Eleusis.\" As he did not\r\nappear, they condemned him, forfeited his goods, and even caused all the\r\npriests and priestesses to curse him publicly. It is said that Theano,\r\nthe daughter of Menon, the priestess of the temple of Agraulos, was the\r\nonly one who refused to carry out this decree, alleging that it was to\r\npray and not to curse that she had become a priestess.\r\n\r\nXXIII. While these terrible decrees and sentences were being passed\r\nagainst Alkibiades, he was living at Argos; for as soon as he left\r\nThurii, he fled to the Peloponnesus, where, terrified at the violence of\r\nhis enemies, he determined to abandon his country, and sent to Sparta\r\ndemanding a safe asylum, on the strength of a promise that he would do\r\nthe Spartans more good than he had in time past done them harm. The\r\nSpartans agreed to his request, and invited him to come. On his arrival,\r\nhe at once effected one important matter, by stirring up the dilatory\r\nSpartans to send Gylippus at once to Syracuse with reinforcements for\r\nthat city, to destroy the Athenian army in Sicily. Next, he brought them\r\nto declare war against the Athenians themselves; while his third and\r\nmost terrible blow to Athens was his causing the Lacedaemonians to seize\r\nand fortify Dekeleia, which did more to ruin Athens than any other\r\nmeasure throughout the war. With his great public reputation, Alkibiades\r\nwas no less popular in private life, and he deluded the people by\r\npretending to adopt the Laconian habits. When they saw him closely\r\nshaved, bathing in cold water, eating dry bread and black broth, they\r\nwondered, and began to doubt whether this man ever had kept a professed\r\ncook, used perfumes, or endured to wear a Milesian mantle. For\r\nAlkibiades, among his other extraordinary qualities, had this especial\r\nart of captivating men by assimilating his own manners and habits to\r\ntheirs, being able to change, more quickly than the chameleon, from one\r\nmode of life to another. The chameleon, indeed, cannot turn itself\r\nwhite; but Alkibiades never found anything, good or bad, which he could\r\nnot imitate to the life. Thus at Sparta he was fond of exercise, frugal\r\nand severe; in Ionia, luxurious, frivolous, and lazy; in Thrace, he\r\ndrank deep; in Thessaly he proved himself a good horseman; while, when\r\nhe was consorting with the satrap Tissaphernes, he outdid even the\r\nPersian splendour and pomp. It was not his real character that he so\r\noften and so easily changed, but as he knew that if he appeared in his\r\ntrue colours, he would be universally disliked, he concealed his real\r\nself under an apparent adoption of the ways and fashions of whatever\r\nplace he was in. In Lacedaemon you would say, looking at his appearance,\r\n\r\n     \"'Tis not Achilles' son, 'tis he himself.\"\r\n\r\nHe was just such a man as Lykurgus himself would have trained; but if\r\nyou examined his habits and actions more closely, you would say:\r\n\r\n     \"'Tis the same woman still.\"\r\n\r\nFor while King Agis was away in the wars, Alkibiades seduced his wife\r\nTimaea, so that she became pregnant by him, and did not even deny the\r\nfact. When her child was born it was called Leotychides in public, but\r\nin her own house she whispered to her friends and attendants that his\r\nname was Alkibiades, so greatly was she enamoured of him. He himself\r\nused to say in jest that he had not acted thus out of wanton passion,\r\nbut in order that his race might one day rule in Lacedaemon. King Agis\r\nheard of all this from many informants, but was most convinced of its\r\ntruth by a computation of the time before the birth of the child.\r\nTerrified at an earthquake, he had once quitted his wife's chamber, and\r\nfor ten months afterwards had never conversed with her. As it was at the\r\nend of this period that Leotychides was born, he declared that the child\r\nwas not his; and for this reason he never succeeded to the throne.\r\n\r\nXXIV. After the Athenian disaster in Sicily, ambassadors came to Sparta\r\nfrom Chios, Lesbos, and Kyzikus. The claims of the Lesbians were\r\nfavoured by the Boeotians, and those of the people of Kyzikus by\r\nPharnabazus; but, at the recommendation of Alkibiades, the\r\nLacedaemonians decided to give the preference to the Chians. He himself\r\nsailed to that island, caused nearly the whole of the cities of Ionia to\r\nrevolt from Athens, and injured the Athenian cause much by constantly\r\nassisting the Lacedaemonian generals. King Agis, however, was already\r\nhis personal enemy, because of Alkibiades's intrigue with his wife, and\r\nnow was enraged at his successes; for it was said that scarcely anything\r\nwas done without Alkibiades. The other leading men in Sparta also hated\r\nAlkibiades, because he had thrown them into the shade; and they had\r\nsufficient influence with the home government to obtain an order for his\r\nexecution, to be sent to the generals in Ionia.\r\n\r\nAlkibiades received warning of this in good time. Alarmed at the news,\r\nhe still continued to co-operate with the Lacedaemonians, but utterly\r\nrefused to trust his person among them. To ensure his safety, he betook\r\nhimself to Tissaphernes, the satrap or viceroy for the king of Persia in\r\nthat province, and at once became the most important personage amongst\r\nhis followers. The barbarian being himself a lover of deceit and of\r\ncrooked ways, admired his cleverness and versatility; while no man's\r\nnature could resist the fascinations and charms of the society of\r\nAlkibiades, which Tissaphernes now enjoyed daily. Although he hated the\r\nGreeks as much as any Persian, yet he was so overpowered by the\r\nflatteries of Alkibiades, that he in his turn repaid him with\r\ncompliments even more excessive. He decreed that the pleasantest of his\r\nparks, a place charmingly wooded and watered, with delightful walks and\r\nsummer-houses, should be called \"the Alkibiades;\" and all men from that\r\ntime forth spoke of it by that name.\r\n\r\nXXV. Now that Alkibiades had determined that the Spartans were not to be\r\ntrusted, and that he was in fear of Agis, their king, he began to speak\r\nevil of them to Tissaphernes, withholding him from assisting them\r\nthoroughly, and enabling them to conquer the Athenians, but advising him\r\nrather to starve the Lacedaemonians forces by insufficient supplies, so\r\nas to play one side off against the other, and thus encourage them to\r\nwear each other out, in order that in the end both might be so weakened\r\nas to fall an easy prey to the Persians.\r\n\r\nTissaphernes at once adopted this policy, and made no secret of his\r\nregard and admiration for Alkibiades, who was now looked up to by the\r\nGreeks on both sides, while the Athenians repented of their decrees\r\nagainst him. He also began to fear that if their city were to be utterly\r\ndestroyed he would necessarily fall into the hands of his enemies, the\r\nLacedaemonians.\r\n\r\nThe most important post in the Athenian empire at this time was the\r\nisland of Samos. Here lay the greater part of their fleet, and it was\r\nfrom this headquarters that they sent out expeditions to recover the\r\nrevolted cities of Ionia, and guarded those which they still retained,\r\nas, in spite of their great losses, they still possessed a fleet capable\r\nof holding its own against the Lacedaemonians. They were in great fear\r\nof Tissaphernes and the Phoenician fleet of a hundred and fifty sail of\r\ntriremes, which was said to be on the point of arriving, because if it\r\nreally came all would be over with Athens. Alkibiades, knowing this,\r\nsent a secret message to the Athenian leaders at Samos, holding out\r\nhopes of bringing Tissaphernes over to the Athenian side. He would not,\r\nhe said, do this to please the populace of Athens, because he could not\r\ntrust them, but he would effect it if the nobility would, like brave\r\ngentlemen, put an end to the insolent behaviour of the lower orders, and\r\nwould themselves undertake to save the city and empire of Athens.\r\n\r\nAll were eager to adopt the proposal of Alkibiades, except Phrynichus of\r\nthe _demos_ or township of Deirades, who suspected the real truth, that\r\nAlkibiades cared nothing about the form of government which might be\r\nestablished at Athens, but was seeking for some excuse for being\r\nrestored to his native country, and thought, by his harsh language about\r\nthe people, to ingratiate himself with the nobles. He was, however,\r\noverruled; and, being now clearly marked as the personal enemy of\r\nAlkibiades, sent a secret message to Astyochus, the admiral of the\r\nLacedaemonian fleet, bidding him beware of Alkibiades, who was playing a\r\ndouble game. However, he met his match in perfidy. Astyochus, desirous\r\nof gaining the favour of Tissaphernes, and seeing that Alkibiades had\r\ngreat influence with him, betrayed Phrynichus's letter to them.\r\nAlkibiades upon this at once sent persons to Samos to charge Phrynichus\r\nwith this act of treason, and he, seeing that all men were shocked at\r\nwhat he had done, and were indignant with him, and being at his wit's\r\nend, endeavoured to heal one mischief by another. He sent a second\r\nletter to Astyochus, reproaching him for his betrayal of confidence, and\r\npromising that he would enable him to capture the fleet and camp of the\r\nAthenians. However, the treachery of Phrynichus did no harm to the\r\nAthenians, because of the counter treachery of Astyochus, who\r\ncommunicated this letter also to Alkibiades. Now Phrynichus, expecting a\r\nsecond charge of treason from Alkibiades, was beforehand with him, in\r\nannouncing to the Athenians that the enemy were about to attack them,\r\nand advising them to keep near their ships, and to fortify their\r\ncamp.[A] This they proceeded to do, when there came a second letter from\r\nAlkibiades, warning them against Phrynichus, who meditated betraying the\r\nharbour to the enemy. This letter was not believed at the time, for men\r\nimagined that Alkibiades, who knew perfectly well all the movements and\r\nintentions of the enemy, was making use of that knowledge to destroy his\r\npersonal enemy Phrynichus, by exciting an undeserved suspicion against\r\nhim. Yet, when afterwards Hermon, one of the Athenian horse-patrol,\r\nstabbed Phrynichus with his dagger in the market-place, the Athenians,\r\nafter trying the case, decided that the deceased was guilty of treason,\r\nand crowned Hermon and his comrades with garlands.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The ancient trireme was not habitable, like a modern ship\r\nof war. The crew always, if possible, landed for their meals, and when\r\nstationed at any place, drew the ship up on the beach and lived entirely\r\non shore.]\r\n\r\nXXVI. The friends of Alkibiades being in a majority at Samos, now\r\ndespatched Peisander to Athens to attempt the subversion of the\r\nrepublic, and to encourage the nobles to seize the government, and put\r\nan end to the democratic constitution. If this was done, they conceived\r\nthat Alkibiades would make Tissaphernes their friend and ally, and this\r\nwas the pretext and excuse put forward by those who established the\r\noligarchy. When, however, the so-called Five Thousand, who really were\r\nthe Four Hundred, were at the head of affairs, they paid but little\r\nattention to Alkibiades, and were very remiss in carrying on the war,\r\npartly because they distrusted the citizens, who were not yet accustomed\r\nto the new constitution, and partly because they thought that the\r\nLacedaemonians, who were always favourable to oligarchical governments,\r\nwould deal more tenderly with them on that account. The Athenian\r\npopulace remained quiet, though sorely against its will, because of the\r\nterror inspired by the oligarchs, for no small number of citizens who\r\nhad opposed the Four Hundred had been put to death; but the men of\r\nSamos, as soon as they heard the news, were indignant, and wished at\r\nonce to sail to Peiraeus. They sent at once for Alkibiades, elected him\r\ntheir general, and bade him lead them on to crush this new despotism.\r\nAlkibiades on this occasion acted like a really great commander, and not\r\nat all as one would expect of a man who had suddenly been raised to\r\npower by popular favour.\r\n\r\nHe refused to curry favour with the soldiery by carrying out their\r\nwishes, regardless of their having found him a homeless exile, and\r\nhaving made him the commander of so many ships and so many men; but he\r\nresisted their impulse, and by preventing their committing so great an\r\nerror, without doubt saved the Athenian empire. For if the fleet had\r\nleft Samos, the enemy could without a battle have made themselves\r\nmasters of the whole of Ionia, the Hellespont, and the islands in the\r\nAegean while Athenians would have fought with Athenians in their own\r\ncity. All this was prevented by Alkibiades alone, who not only persuaded\r\nthe populace, and pointed out the folly of such proceedings in public\r\nspeeches, but even entreated and commanded each individual man to remain\r\nat Samos. He was assisted in this by Thrasybulus, of the township of\r\nSteiria, who was present, and spoke in his loud voice, which was said to\r\nbe the loudest of any Athenian of his time. This was a noble achievement\r\nof Alkibiades, and so, too, was his undertaking that the Phoenician\r\nfleet, which the Lacedaemonians expected would be sent by the Persian\r\nking to help them, should either be won over to the Athenian side, or at\r\nany rate prevented from joining the Lacedaemonians. In order to effect\r\nthis, he sailed away in great haste, and, although the Phoenician fleet\r\nwas at Aspendus, yet Tissaphernes brought it no further, and deceived\r\nthe Lacedaemonians. Both parties gave Alkibiades the credit of having\r\ndetained it, and more especially the Lacedaemonians, who imagined that\r\nhe was teaching the Persians to allow the Greeks to destroy one another,\r\nfor it was perfectly clear that such a force, if added to either of the\r\ncontending parties, must have made them complete masters of the sea.\r\n\r\nXXVII. After this the government of the Four Hundred was dissolved, as\r\nthe friends of Alkibiades eagerly took the side of the popular party.\r\nAlthough the Athenians now wished and even commanded Alkibiades to\r\nreturn to his native city, yet he felt that he ought not to come home\r\nemptyhanded, and owing his restoration to the good nature of the\r\npeople, but rather to return after some glorious achievement. With this\r\nintention he at first left Samos with a few ships and cruised in the\r\nseas near Knidus and Kôs; then, hearing that Mindarus, the Spartan\r\nadmiral, had gone to the Hellespont with all his fleet, and that the\r\nAthenian fleet had followed him, he hurried to the assistance of the\r\nAthenian commanders.\r\n\r\nSailing northwards with eighteen triremes he chanced to arrive towards\r\nevening, at the end of a sea-fight off Abydos, in which neither party\r\nhad won any decided advantage. The appearance of his squadron caused\r\nvery different feelings among the combatants, for the Athenians were\r\nalarmed, and the enemy encouraged. However, he soon hoisted an Athenian\r\nflag, and bore down upon that part of the Peloponnesian fleet which had\r\nbeen hitherto victorious. He put them to flight, compelled them to run\r\ntheir ships ashore, and then attacking them, disabled their ships, and\r\nbroke them to pieces, forcing the crews to swim ashore, where\r\nPharnabazus the satrap led a force to the water's edge to fight for the\r\npreservation of the vessels. In the end the Athenians took thirty ships,\r\nrecovered those of their own which had been captured, and erected a\r\ntrophy, as victors.\r\n\r\nAlkibiades gained great glory by this splendid piece of good fortune,\r\nand at once went off with rich presents and a gorgeous military retinue,\r\nto display his fresh laurels to Tissaphernes. He met, however, with a\r\nvery different reception to that which he expected, for Tissaphernes,\r\nwhose mind had been poisoned against him by the Lacedaemonians, and who\r\nfeared that the king might be displeased with his own dealings with\r\nAlkibiades, considered that he had arrived at a very opportune moment,\r\nand at once seized him and imprisoned him at Sardis; thinking that this\r\narbitrary act would prove to the world that the other suspicions of an\r\nunderstanding between them were unfounded.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. Thirty days afterwards, Alkibiades by some means obtained a\r\nhorse, eluded his guards, and fled for refuge to Klazomenae. He gave out\r\nthat he had been privately released by Tissaphernes himself, in order to\r\ndisgrace that satrap, and at once sailed to the Athenian fleet in the\r\nHellespont. Learning that Mindarus and Pharnabazus were both in the city\r\nof Kyzikus, he encouraged his soldiers by a speech, in which he told\r\nthem that they would have to fight at sea, on land, and against the town\r\nwalls too, for that if they were not completely victorious they could\r\nget no pay. He manned his ships and proceeded to Prokonessus, ordering\r\nall small vessels which they met to be seized and detained in the\r\ninterior of the fleet, in order that the enemy might not learn his\r\nmovements. It happened also that a heavy thunderstorm with rain and\r\ndarkness assisted his design, as he not only was unseen by the enemy,\r\nbut was never suspected of any intention of attack by the Athenians\r\nthemselves, who had given up any idea of going to sea when he ordered\r\nthem on board. Little by little the clouds cleared away, and disclosed\r\nthe Peloponnesian fleet cruising off the harbour of Kyzikus. Alkibiades,\r\nfearing that if the enemy saw how numerous his own fleet was, they would\r\ntake refuge on shore, ordered the other commanders to remain behind\r\nunder easy sail, and himself with forty ships went on ahead to entice\r\nthem to an engagement. The Peloponnesians, deceived by this manoeuvre,\r\nat once attacked these few ships, despising their small numbers. But the\r\nlittle squadron engaged them until the rest came up, when they fled\r\nashore in terror. Alkibiades with twenty of the fastest sailing ships\r\nbroke through the enemy's line, ran his ships ashore, landed their\r\ncrews, and attacked the fugitives from the enemy's fleet with terrible\r\nslaughter. Mindarus and Pharnabazus now came to the rescue, but they\r\nwere beaten back; Mindarus died fighting bravely, and Pharnabazus only\r\nsaved himself by flight. By this battle the Athenians obtained\r\npossession of many dead bodies of their enemies,[A] many stand of arms,\r\nthe whole of the hostile fleet, and the town of Kyzikus, which they took\r\nby storm, putting its Peloponnesian garrison to the sword, as soon as\r\nPharnabazus withdrew his troops. They now not merely obtained a firm\r\nhold on the Hellespont, but were able to drive the Lacedaemonians from\r\nthe sea in all quarters. A despatch was captured, written in the\r\nLaconian fashion, informing the Ephors of the disaster. \"Our ships are\r\ngone; Mindarus is slain; the men are starving; we know not what to do.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The Greeks attached great importance to the burial of the\r\ndead. The usual test of which party had won a battle was, which side\r\nafter it demanded a truce for the burial of the dead. Here the\r\npossession of the dead bodies of the enemy is enumerated as one of the\r\nproofs of victory.]\r\n\r\nXXIX. The men who had served under Alkibiades were so elated by this\r\nvictory that they disdained to mix with the rest of the army, alleging\r\nthat the others had often been defeated, and that they were invincible.\r\nIndeed, not long before, Thrasyllus had received a defeat near Ephesus,\r\nupon which the Ephesians erected the brazen trophy to the disgrace of\r\nthe Athenians; so that the soldiers of Alkibiades reproached those of\r\nThrasyllus with this, glorifying themselves and their commander, and\r\nrefusing to allow the others to make use of their places of exercise or\r\ntheir quarters in camp. However, when Pharnabazus with a large force of\r\ninfantry and calvary attacked them while they were invading the\r\nterritory of Abydos, Alkibiades led them out to fight him, defeated him,\r\nand, together with Thrasyllus, pursued him till nightfall. After this\r\nthe soldiers fraternised with each other and returned to their camp\r\nrejoicing together. On the following day Alkibiades erected a trophy and\r\nravaged the country of Pharnabazus, no one daring to oppose him. He even\r\ntook priests and priestesses prisoners, but released them without\r\nransom.\r\n\r\nThe city of Chalkedon had revolted from Athens, and received a\r\nLacedaemonian harmost[A] and garrison. Alkibiades was eager to attack\r\nthem, but, hearing that they had collected all the property[B] in their\r\ncountry and placed it in the hands of the Bithynians, a friendly tribe,\r\nhe led his whole army to the Bithynian frontier and sent a herald to\r\nthat people reproaching them for what they had done. In terror, the\r\nBithynians gave up the property to him, and entered into an alliance\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: A \"harmost,\" [Greek: harmostês], was an officer sent from\r\nSparta to administer a subject city. See p. 97.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: Probably consisting of corn and cattle, as Clough\r\ntranslates it.]\r\n\r\nXXX. He now completely invested Chalkedon, by building a wall reaching\r\nfrom sea to sea. Pharnabazus came down to raise the siege, and\r\nHippokrates, the harmost of the city, led out his forces and attacked\r\nthe Athenians at the same time. Alkibiades arranged his army so as to be\r\nable to fight them both at once, forced Pharnabazus to retreat with\r\ndisgrace, killed Hippokrates, and put his force to flight with severe\r\nloss. He now took a cruise round the Hellespont, to raise contributions\r\nfrom the towns on the coast, during which he took Selymbria, where he,\r\nvery unnecessarily, was exposed to great personal risk. The party who\r\nintended to betray the city had arranged to show a torch as a signal at\r\nmidnight, but were compelled to do so before the appointed time, fearing\r\none of the conspirators, who suddenly changed his mind. When then the\r\ntorch was raised, the army was not ready for the assault, but\r\nAlkibiades, taking some thirty men with him, ran at full speed up to the\r\nwalls, giving orders to the rest to follow. The city gate was opened for\r\nhim, and, twenty peltasts[A] having joined his thirty soldiers, he\r\nentered, when he perceived the men of Selymbria under arms marching down\r\nthe street to meet him. To await their onset would have been ruin, while\r\npride forbade a hitherto invincible general to retire. Ordering his\r\ntrumpet to sound, he bade one of those present proclaim aloud that the\r\nSelymbrians ought not to appear in arms against the Athenians. This\r\nspeech made some of the townspeople less eager to fight, as they\r\nimagined that their enemies were all within the walls, while it\r\nencouraged others who hoped to arrange matters peaceably. While they\r\nwere standing opposite to one another and parleying, Alkibiades's army\r\ncame up, and he, truly conjecturing that the Selymbrians were really\r\ndisposed to be friendly, began to fear that his Thracian troops might\r\nsack the city; for many of these barbarians were serving in his army as\r\nvolunteers, from a particular attachment they had to his person. He\r\ntherefore sent them all out of the city, and did not permit the\r\nterrified people of Selymbria to suffer any violence, but, having\r\nexacted a contribution of money and placed a garrison in the town, he\r\nsailed away.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Peltasts were light-armed troops, so called because they\r\ncarried light round shields instead of the large unwieldy oblong shield\r\nof the Hoplite, or heavy-armed infantry soldier. These light troops came\r\ngradually into favour with the Greeks during the Peloponnesian war, and\r\nafterward became very extensively used.]\r\n\r\nXXXI. Meanwhile the generals who were besieging Chalkedon made an\r\nagreement with Pharnabazus, on these conditions. They were to receive a\r\nsum of money; the people of Chalkedon were to become subjects of Athens\r\nas before; Pharnabazus was not to lay waste the province; and he was to\r\nprovide an escort and a safe-conduct for an Athenian embassy to the\r\nPersian king. On the return of Alkibiades, Pharnabazus desired him to\r\nswear to observe these conditions, but Alkibiades refused to do so\r\nunless Pharnabazus swore first. After this capitulation he proceeded to\r\nByzantium, which had revolted from Athens, and built a wall round that\r\ncity. Anaxilaus and Lykurgus, with some others, now offered to betray\r\nthe city if the lives and property of the inhabitants were spared. Upon\r\nthis Alkibiades put about a report that his presence was urgently\r\nrequired on the Ionian coast, and sailed away by daylight with all his\r\nfleet. The same night he landed with all his soldiers, and marched up to\r\nthe walls in silence, while the fleet, with a great clamour and\r\ndisturbance, forced its way into the harbour. The suddenness of this\r\nassault, entirely unexpected as it was, terrified the people of\r\nByzantium, and gave those of them who inclined to the Athenian side an\r\nopportunity of admitting Alkibiades quietly, while the attention of\r\nevery one was directed to the ships in the harbour. The town did not,\r\nhowever, surrender altogether without fighting; for the Peloponnesians,\r\nMegarians, and Boeotians who were in it drove the Athenians back into\r\ntheir ships with loss, and when they heard that the land forces had\r\nentered the town they formed in line and engaged them. A severe battle\r\ntook place, but Alkibiades on the right wing, and Theramenes on the\r\nleft, were at length victorious, and took prisoners the survivors, some\r\nthree hundred in number. After this battle no citizen of Byzantium was\r\neither put to death or banished, those being the terms on which the\r\nconspirators had delivered up the city, namely, that they should suffer\r\nno loss of life or property.\r\n\r\nAnaxilaus was afterwards tried at Sparta for having betrayed the city,\r\nand justified what he had done, saying that he was not a Lacedaemonian,\r\nbut a Byzantine, and that he saw Byzantium, not Sparta, in danger, as\r\nthe city was surrounded by the enemy's siege works, no provisions being\r\nbrought in to it, and what there was in it being consumed by the\r\nPeloponnesians and Boeotians, while the people of Byzantium with their\r\nwives and children were starving. He did not, he said, betray the city\r\nto the enemy, but relieved it from the miseries of war, imitating\r\ntherein the noblest Lacedaemonians, whose only idea of what was noble\r\nand just was what would serve their own country. The Lacedaemonians, on\r\nhearing this speech, were ashamed to press the charge, and acquitted\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nXXXII. Now, at length, Alkibiades began to wish to see his native\r\ncountry again, and still more to be seen and admired by his countrymen\r\nafter his splendid series of victories. He proceeded home with the\r\nAthenian fleet, which was magnificently adorned with shields and\r\ntrophies, and had many prizes in tow, and the flags of many more which\r\nhe had captured and destroyed--all of them together amounting to not\r\nless than two hundred. But we cannot believe the additions which Douris\r\nthe Samian, who says that he is a descendant of Alkibiades, makes to\r\nthis story, to the effect that Chrysogonus, the victor at the Pythian\r\ngames, played on the flute to mark the time for the rowers, while\r\nKallipides the tragedian, attired in his buskins, purple robe, and other\r\ntheatrical properties, gave them orders, and that the admiral's ship\r\ncame into harbour with purple sails, as if returning from a party of\r\npleasure. Neither Theopompus, nor Ephorus, nor Xenophon mentions these\r\ncircumstances, nor was it likely that he should present himself before\r\nthe Athenians in such a swaggering fashion, when he was returning home\r\nfrom exile, after having suffered such a variety of misfortunes. The\r\ntruth is, he sailed to Athens with considerable misgivings, and on his\r\narrival would not leave his ship until from her deck he saw Euryptolemus\r\nhis cousin, with many of his friends and relatives, assembled to welcome\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhen he landed, the people seemed to have no eyes for the other\r\ngenerals, but all rushed towards him, and escorted him on his way,\r\ncheering him, embracing him, and crowning him with flowers. Those who\r\ncould not get near him gazed upon him from a distance, and the older men\r\npointed him out to the younger ones. Yet the joy of the citizens was\r\nmingled with tears in the midst of their rejoicings, when they thought\r\nof their past disasters, for they reflected that they would not have\r\nfailed in Sicily, or met with any of their other terrible\r\ndisappointments, if they had not parted with Alkibiades when in the full\r\ntide of prosperity. He had found Athens barely able to hold her own at\r\nsea, by land mistress of little more than the ground on which the city\r\nstood, and torn by internal strife; from which miserable and forlorn\r\ncondition he had restored her so completely, that she was again not only\r\nomnipotent at sea, but also victorious everywhere on land.\r\n\r\nXXXIII. Before his return a decree had been passed authorising him to do\r\nso, at the instance of Kritias, the son of Kallaeschrus, who himself\r\nalludes to it in his poems, mentioning the service which he performed\r\nfor Alkibiades in the following verse:\r\n\r\n    \"I moved your restoration by decree,\r\n    And that you're home again you owe to me.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately on the return of Alkibiades, the people assembled in the\r\nPnyx, where he addressed them. He spoke with tears of his misfortunes,\r\nfor which he partly reproached his countrymen, though he attributed them\r\nchiefly to his own unlucky fortune, and he greatly raised their hopes by\r\nspeaking encouragingly about their probable successes in the future. He\r\nwas honoured with golden crowns, and elected sole general with absolute\r\npower both by sea and land. A decree was also passed by which his\r\nproperty was restored to him, and the Eumolpidae and Kerykes were\r\nordered to retract the curses which they had invoked upon him at the\r\ninstance of the people. When all the rest obeyed, Theodorus the\r\nhierophant excused himself, saying, If he has done the State no wrong, I\r\nnever cursed him.\r\n\r\nXXXIV. While Alkibiades was in this glorious career of prosperity, some\r\npersons in spite of his success foreboded evil from the day which he had\r\nchosen for his return home; for on the day on which he sailed into the\r\nharbour the statue of Athene on the Acropolis is stripped of its\r\ngarments and ornaments, which are cleaned, while it in the meanwhile is\r\ncovered up to conceal it from human eyes. This ceremony takes place on\r\nthe 25th of the month Thargelion, which day is considered by the\r\nAthenians to be the unluckiest of all. Moreover, the goddess did not\r\nappear to receive Alkibiades with a kindly welcome, but to turn away her\r\nface from him and drive him from her presence. Be this as it may, all\r\nwent well and just as Alkibiades wished. A fleet of a hundred triremes\r\nwas manned, and placed at his disposal, but he with creditable pride\r\nrefused to set sail until after the celebration of the Eleusinian\r\nmysteries. Since the permanent occupation of Dekeleia and of the passes\r\ncommanding the road to Eleusis by the enemy, the procession had been\r\nnecessarily shorn of many of its distinctive features, as it had to be\r\nsent by sea. All the customary sacrifices, dances, and other rites which\r\nused to be practised on the road, when Iacchus is carried along in\r\nsolemn procession, were of necessity omitted. It seemed therefore to\r\nAlkibiades that it would both honour the gods and increase his own\r\nreputation among men, if he restored the ancient form of this ceremony,\r\nescorting the procession with his troops and protecting it from the\r\nenemy; for he argued that Agis would lose prestige if he did not attack,\r\nbut allowed the procession to pass unmolested, whereas if he did attack,\r\nAlkibiades would be able to fight in a holy cause, in defence of the\r\nmost sacred institutions of his country, with all his countrymen present\r\nas witnesses of his own valour. When he determined to do this, after\r\nconcerting measures with the Eumolpidae and Kerykes, he placed vedettes\r\non the mountains and sent an advanced guard off at day-break, following\r\nwith the priests, novices, and initiators marching in the midst of his\r\narmy, in great good order and perfect silence. It was an august and\r\nsolemn procession, and all who did not envy him said that he had\r\nperformed the office of a high priest in addition of that of a general.\r\nThe enemy made no attack, and he led his troops safely back to Athens,\r\nfull of pride himself, and making his army proud to think itself\r\ninvincible while under his command. He had so won the affections of the\r\npoor and the lower orders, that they were strangely desirous of living\r\nunder his rule. Many even besought him to put down the malignity of his\r\npersonal enemies, sweep away laws, decrees, and other pernicious\r\nnonsense, and carry on the government without fear of a factious\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nXXXV. What his own views about making himself despot of Athens may have\r\nbeen we cannot tell; but the leading citizens took alarm at this, and\r\nhurried him away as quickly as possible to sea, voting whatever measures\r\nhe pleased, and allowing him to choose his own colleagues. He set sail\r\nwith his hundred ships, reached Andros, and defeated the inhabitants of\r\nthat island, and the Lacedaemonian garrison there. He did not, however,\r\ncapture the city, and this afterwards became one of the points urged\r\nagainst him by his enemies. Indeed, if there ever was a man destroyed by\r\nhis reputation, it was Alkibiades. Being supposed to be such a prodigy\r\nof daring and subtlety, his failures were regarded with suspicion, as if\r\nhe could have succeeded had he been in earnest; for his countrymen would\r\nnot believe that he could really fail in anything which he seriously\r\nattempted. They expected to hear of the capture of Chios, and of the\r\nwhole Ionian coast, and were vexed at not at once receiving the news of\r\na complete success. They did not take into account the want of money\r\nwhich Alkibiades felt, while warring against men who had the king of\r\nPersia for their paymaster, and which made frequent absences from his\r\ncamp necessary to provide subsistence for his troops. It was one of\r\nthese expeditions, indeed, which exposed him to the last and most\r\nimportant of the many charges brought against him. Lysander had been\r\nsent by the Lacedaemonians to take the command of their fleet. On his\r\narrival, by means of the money paid by Cyrus, he raised the pay of his\r\nsailors from three obols a day to four. Alkibiades, who could with\r\ndifficulty pay his men even three obols, went to Caria to levy\r\ncontributions, leaving in command of the fleet one Antiochus, a good\r\nseaman, but a thoughtless and silly man. He had distinct orders from\r\nAlkibiades not to fight even if the enemy attacked him, but such was his\r\ninsolent disregard of these instructions that he manned his own trireme\r\nand one other, sailed to Ephesus, and there passed along the line of the\r\nenemy's ships, as they lay on the beach, using the most scurrilous and\r\ninsulting language and gestures. At first Lysander put to sea with a few\r\nships to pursue him, but as the Athenians came out to assist him, the\r\naction became general. The entire fleets engaged and Lysander was\r\nvictorious. He killed Antiochus, captured many ships and men, and set up\r\na trophy. When Alkibiades on his return to Samos heard of this, he put\r\nto sea with all his ships, and offered battle to Lysander; but he was\r\nsatisfied with his previous victory, and refused the offer.\r\n\r\nXXXVI. Thrasybulus, the son of Thrason, a bitter personal enemy of\r\nAlkibiades, now set sail for Athens to accuse him, and to exasperate his\r\nenemies in the city against him. He made a speech to the people,\r\nrepresenting that Alkibiades had ruined their affairs and lost their\r\nships by insolently abusing his authority and entrusting the command,\r\nduring his own absence, to men who owed their influence with him to deep\r\ndrinking and cracking seamen's jokes, and that he securely traversed the\r\nprovinces to raise money, indulging in drunken debauches with Ionian\r\ncourtezans, while the enemy's fleet was riding close to his own. He was\r\nalso blamed for the construction of certain forts in Thrace, near\r\nBisanthe, which he destined as a place of refuge for himself, as if he\r\ncould not or would not live in his native city.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians were so wrought upon by these charges against Alkibiades,\r\nthat they elected other generals to supersede him, thus showing their\r\nanger and dislike for him. Alkibiades, on learning this, left the\r\nAthenian camp altogether, got together a force of foreign troops, and\r\nmade war on the irregular Thracian tribes on his own account, thus\r\nobtaining much plunder and freeing the neighbouring Greek cities from\r\nthe dread of the barbarians. Now when the generals Tydeus, Menander, and\r\nAdeimantus came with the entire Athenian fleet to Aegospotamoi, they\r\nused early every morning to go to Lampsakus to challenge the fleet of\r\nLysander, which lay there, to a sea-fight. After this ceremony they\r\nwould return and spend the whole day in careless indolence, as if\r\ndespising their enemy. Alkibiades, who lived close by, did not disregard\r\ntheir danger, but even rode over on horseback and pointed out to the\r\ngenerals that they were very badly quartered in a place where there was\r\nno harbour and no city, having to obtain all their provisions from\r\nSestos, and, when the ships were once hauled up on shore, allowing the\r\nmen to leave them unguarded and straggle where they pleased, although\r\nthey were in the presence of a fleet which was trained to act in silence\r\nand good order at the command of one man.\r\n\r\nXXXVII. Though Alkibiades gave this advice, and urged the generals to\r\nremove to Sestos, they would not listen to him. Tydeus indeed rudely\r\nbade him begone, for they, not he, were now generals. Alkibiades, too,\r\nsuspected that there was some treachery in the case, and retired,\r\ntelling his personal friends, who escorted him out of the camp, that if\r\nhe had not been so outrageously insulted by the generals, he could in a\r\nfew days have compelled the Lacedaemonians either to fight a battle at\r\nsea against their will, or abandon their ships. To some this seemed mere\r\nboasting, while others thought that he could very possibly effect it by\r\nbringing many Thracian light-armed troops and cavalry to assault the\r\ncamp on the land side. However, the result soon proved that he had\r\nrightly seen the fault of the Athenian position. Lysander suddenly and\r\nunexpectedly assailed it, and except eight triremes which escaped under\r\nKonon, took all the rest, nearly two hundred in number. Lysander also\r\nput three thousand prisoners to the sword. He shortly afterwards\r\ncaptured Athens, burned her ships, and pulled down her Long Walls.\r\nAlkibiades, terrified at seeing the Lacedaemonians omnipotent by sea and\r\nland, shifted his quarters to Bithynia, sending thither a great amount\r\nof treasure, and taking much with him, but leaving much more in his\r\nThracian fortresses. In Bithynia, however, he suffered much loss at the\r\nhands of the natives, and determined to proceed to the court of\r\nArtaxerxes, thinking that the Persian king, if he would make trial of\r\nhim, would find that he was not inferior to Themistokles in ability,\r\nwhile he sought him in a much more honourable way; for it was not to\r\nrevenge himself on his fellow-citizens, as Themistokles did, but to\r\nassist his own country against its enemy that he meant to solicit the\r\nking's aid. Imagining that Pharnabazus would be able to grant him a safe\r\npassage to the Persian court, he went into Phrygia to meet him, and\r\nremained there for some time, paying his court to the satrap, and\r\nreceiving from him marks of respect.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. The Athenians were terribly cast down at the loss of their\r\nempire; but when Lysander robbed them of their liberty as well, by\r\nestablishing the government of the Thirty Tyrants, they began to\r\nentertain thoughts which never had occurred to them before, while it was\r\nyet possible that the State might be saved from ruin. They bewailed\r\ntheir past blunders and mistakes, and of these they considered their\r\nsecond fit of passion with Alkibiades to have been the greatest. They\r\nhad cast him off for no fault of his own, but merely because they were\r\nangry with his follower for having lost a few ships disgracefully; they\r\nhad much more disgraced themselves by losing the services of the ablest\r\nand bravest general whom they possessed. Even in their present abasement\r\na vague hope prevailed among them that Athens could not be utterly lost\r\nwhile Alkibiades was alive; for he had not during his former exile been\r\nsatisfied with a quiet life, and surely now, however prosperous his\r\nprivate circumstances might be, he would not endure to see the triumph\r\nof the Lacedaemonians, and the arrogant tyranny of the Thirty. Indeed\r\nthis was proved to be no vain dream by the care which the Thirty took to\r\nwatch all the motions of Alkibiades. At last, Kritias informed Lysander,\r\nthat while Athens was governed by a democracy, the Lacedaemonian empire\r\nin Greece could never be safe; and if the Athenians were ever so much\r\ninclined to an oligarchical form of government, Alkibiades, if he lived,\r\nwould not long suffer them to submit to it. However, Lysander was not\r\nprevailed upon by these arguments until a despatch came from Sparta\r\nbidding him make away with Alkibiades, either because the home\r\ngovernment feared his ability and enterprise, or because they wished to\r\nplease his enemy, King Agis.\r\n\r\nXXXIX. Lysander now sent orders for his death to Pharnabazus, who\r\nentrusted their execution to his brother Magaeus and his uncle\r\nSusamithres. Alkibiades was at this time dwelling in a village in\r\nPhrygia, with Timandra the courtezan, and one night he dreamed that he\r\nwas dressed in his mistress's clothes, and that she, holding his head in\r\nher arms, was painting his face and adorning him like a woman. Others\r\nsay that he saw Magaeus in his dream cutting off his head, and his body\r\nall in flames. All, however, agree that the dream took place shortly\r\nbefore his death. His murderers did not dare to enter the house, but\r\nstood round it in a circle and set it on fire. Alkibiades, on\r\ndiscovering them, flung most of the bedding and clothes on to the fire,\r\nwrapped his cloak round his left arm, and with his dagger in his right\r\ndashed through the flames unhurt, not giving his clothes time to catch\r\nfire. None of the barbarians dared to await his onset, but as soon as\r\nthey saw him they scattered, and from a distance shot at him with darts\r\nand arrows. After he had fallen and the barbarians were gone, Timandra\r\ntook up his corpse, covered it with her own clothes, and, as far as was\r\nin her power, showed it every mark of honour and respect.\r\n\r\nThis Timandra is said to have been the mother of Lais, commonly called\r\nthe Corinthian, who really was brought as a captive from Hykkara, a\r\nsmall town in Sicily. Some writers, although they agree in their account\r\nof the manner of his death, differ as to its cause, alleging that it was\r\nneither due to Pharnabazus nor to Lysander nor the Lacedaemonians, but\r\nthat Alkibiades had debauched a girl of noble birth and was living with\r\nher, and that her relatives, enraged at this insult, during the night\r\nset fire to the house in which Alkibiades was living, and, as has been\r\nrelated, shot him as he leaped out through the flames.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The patrician family of the Marcii at Rome produced many illustrious\r\nmen, amongst whom was Ancus Marcius, the grandson of Numa, who became\r\nking after the death of Tullus Hostilius. To this family also belonged\r\nPublius and Quintus Marcius, who supplied Rome with abundance of\r\nexcellent water, and Censorinus, twice appointed censor by the Roman\r\npeople, who afterwards passed a law that no one should hold that office\r\ntwice.\r\n\r\nCaius Marcius, the subject of this memoir, was an orphan, and brought up\r\nby a widowed mother. He proved that, hard though the lot of an orphan\r\nmay be, yet it does not prevent a man's becoming great and\r\ndistinguished, and that the bad alone allege it as an excuse for an\r\nintemperate life. He also proves to us that a naturally noble nature, if\r\nit be not properly disciplined, will produce many good and bad qualities\r\ntogether, just as a rich field, if not properly tilled, will produce\r\nboth weeds and good fruit. The immense energy and courage of his mind\r\nused to urge him to attempt and to perform great exploits, but his harsh\r\nand ambitious temper made it difficult for him to live on friendly terms\r\nwith his companions. They used to admire his indifference to pleasure\r\nand pain, and his contempt for bribes, but in politics they were angered\r\nby his morose and haughty manner, too proud for a citizen of a republic.\r\nIndeed there is no advantage to be gained from a liberal education so\r\ngreat as that of softening and disciplining the natural ferocity of our\r\ndisposition, by teaching it moderation, and how to avoid all extremes.\r\nHowever, at that period warlike virtues were valued above all others at\r\nRome, which is proved by the Romans possessing only one word for virtue\r\nand for bravery, so that virtue, a general term, is applied by them to\r\nthe particular form, courage.\r\n\r\nII. Marcius, having an especial passion for war, was familiar from\r\nchildhood with the use of arms. Reflecting that artificial weapons are\r\nof little use without a body capable of wielding them, he so trained\r\nhimself for all possible emergencies that he was both able to run\r\nswiftly and also to grapple with his foe so strongly that few could\r\nescape from him. Those who entered into any contest with him, when\r\nbeaten, used to ascribe their defeat to his immense bodily strength,\r\nwhich no exertions could tire out.\r\n\r\nIII. He served his first campaign while yet a youth, when Tarquin, the\r\nexiled King of Rome, after many battles and defeats, staked all upon one\r\nlast throw, and assembled an army to attack Rome. His force consisted\r\nchiefly of Latins, but many other Italian states took his part in the\r\nwar, not from any attachment to his person, but through fear and dislike\r\nof the growing power of Rome. In the battle which ensued, in which\r\nvarious turns of fortune took place, Marcius, while fighting bravely\r\nunder the eye of the dictator himself, saw a Roman fallen and helpless\r\nnear him. He at once made for this man, stood in front of him, and\r\nkilled his assailant. After the victory, Marcius was among the first who\r\nreceived the oak-leaf crown. This crown is given to him who has saved\r\nthe life of a citizen in battle, and is composed of oak-leaves, either\r\nout of compliment to the Arcadians, whom the oracle calls 'acorn\r\neaters,' or because in any campaign in any country it is easy to obtain\r\noak-boughs, or it may be that the oak, sacred to Jupiter the protector\r\nof cities, forms a suitable crown for one who has saved the life of a\r\ncitizen. The oak is the most beautiful of all wild trees, and the\r\nstrongest of those which are artificially cultivated. It afforded men in\r\nearly times both food and drink, by its acorns and the honey found in\r\nit, while by the bird-lime which it produces, it enables them to catch\r\nmost kinds of birds and other creatures, as additional dainties.\r\n\r\nThis was the battle in which they say that the Dioscuri, Castor and\r\nPollux, appeared, and immediately after the battle were soon in the\r\nForum at Rome announcing the victory, with their horses dripping with\r\nsweat, at the spot where now there is a temple built in their honour\r\nbeside the fountain. In memory of this, the day of the victory, the 15th\r\nof July, is kept sacred to the Dioscuri.\r\n\r\nIV. To win distinction early in life is said to quench and satisfy the\r\neagerness of some men whose desire for glory is not keen; but for those\r\nwith whom it is the ruling passion of their lives, the gaining of\r\nhonours only urges them on, as a ship is urged by a gale, to fresh\r\nachievements. They do not regard themselves as having received a reward,\r\nbut as having given a pledge for the future, and they feel it their duty\r\nnot to disgrace the reputation which they have acquired, but to eclipse\r\ntheir former fame by some new deed of prowess. Marcius, feeling this,\r\nwas ever trying to surpass himself in valour, and gained such prizes and\r\ntrophies that the later generals under whom he served were always\r\nstriving to outdo the former ones in their expressions of esteem for\r\nhim, and their testimony to his merits. Many as were the wars in which\r\nRome was then engaged, Marcius never returned from any without a prize\r\nfor valour or some especial mark of distinction. Other men were brave in\r\norder to win glory, but Marcius won glory in order to please his mother.\r\nThat she should hear him praised, see him crowned, and embrace him\r\nweeping for joy, was the greatest honour and happiness of his life.\r\nEpameinondas is said to have had the same feelings, and to have\r\nconsidered it to be his greatest good-fortune that his father and mother\r\nwere both alive to witness his triumphant success at the battle of\r\nLeuktra. He, however, enjoyed the sympathy and applause of both parents,\r\nbut Marcius, being fatherless, lavished on his mother all that affection\r\nwhich should have belonged to his father, besides her own share. So\r\nboundless was his love for Volumnia that at her earnest desire he even\r\nmarried a wife, but still continued to live in the house of his mother.\r\n\r\nV. At this time, when his reputation and influence were very\r\nconsiderable because of his prowess, there was a party-quarrel going on\r\nin Rome between the patricians, who wished to defend the privileges of\r\nmen of property, and the people, who were suffering terrible\r\nill-treatment at the hands of their creditors. Those who possessed a\r\nsmall property were forced either to pledge or to sell it, while those\r\nwho were absolutely destitute were carried off and imprisoned, though\r\nthey might be scarred and enfeebled from the wars in which they had\r\nserved in defence of their country. The last campaign was that against\r\nthe Sabines, after which their rich creditors promised to treat them\r\nwith less harshness. In pursuance of a decree of the Senate, Marcus\r\nValerius the consul was the guarantee of this promise. But when, after\r\nserving manfully in this campaign and conquering the enemy, they met\r\nwith no better treatment from their creditors, and the Senate seemed\r\nunmindful of its engagements, allowing them to be imprisoned and\r\ndistresses to be levied upon their property as before, there were\r\nviolent outbreaks and riots in the city. This disturbed condition of the\r\ncommonwealth was taken advantage of by the enemy, who invaded the\r\ncountry and plundered it. When the consuls called all men of military\r\nage to arms, no one obeyed, and then at last the patricians hesitated.\r\nSome thought that they ought to yield to the lower classes, and make\r\nsome concessions instead of enforcing the strict letter of the law\r\nagainst them; while others, among whom was Marcius, opposed this idea,\r\nnot because he thought the money of great consequence, but because he\r\nconsidered this to be the beginning of an outburst of democratic\r\ninsolence which a wise government would take timely measures to suppress\r\nbefore it gathered strength.\r\n\r\nVI. As the Senate, although it frequently met, came to no decision on\r\nthis matter, the plebeians suddenly assembled in a body, left the city,\r\nand established themselves on what was afterwards called the Mons Sacer,\r\nor Sacred Hill, near the river Anio. They abstained from all factious\r\nproceedings, and merely stated that they had been driven from the city\r\nby the wealthy classes. Air and water and a place in which to be buried,\r\nthey said, could be obtained anywhere in Italy, and they could get\r\nnothing more than this in Rome, except the privilege of being wounded or\r\nslain in fighting battles on behalf of the rich. At this demonstration,\r\nthe Senate became alarmed, and sent the most moderate and popular of its\r\nmembers to treat with the people. The spokesman of this embassy was\r\nMenenius Agrippa, who, after begging the plebeians to come to terms, and\r\npleading the cause of the Senate with them, wound up his speech by the\r\nfollowing fable: Once upon a time, said he, all the members revolted\r\nagainst the belly, reproaching it with lying idle in the body, and\r\nmaking all the other members work in order to provide it with food; but\r\nthe belly laughed them to scorn, saying that it was quite true that it\r\ntook all the food which the body obtained, but that it afterwards\r\ndistributed it among all the members. \"This,\" he said, \"is the part\r\nplayed by the Senate in the body politic. It digests and arranges all\r\nthe affairs of the State, and provides all of you with wholesome and\r\nuseful measures.\"\r\n\r\nVII. Upon this they came to terms, after stipulating that five men\r\nshould be chosen to defend the cause of the people, who are now known as\r\ntribunes of the people. They chose for the first tribunes the leaders of\r\nthe revolt, the chief of whom were Junius Brutus and Sicinius Vellutus.\r\nAs soon as the State was one again, the people assembled under arms, and\r\nzealously offered their services for war to their rulers. Marcius,\r\nthough but little pleased with these concessions which the plebeians had\r\nwrung from the patricians, yet, noticing that many patricians were of\r\nhis mind, called upon them not to be outdone in patriotism by the\r\nplebeians, but to prove themselves their superiors in valour rather than\r\nin political strength.\r\n\r\nVIII. Corioli was the most important city of the Volscian nation, with\r\nwhich Rome then was at war. The consul Cominius was besieging it, and\r\nthe Volscians, fearing it might be taken, gathered from all quarters,\r\nmeaning to fight a battle under the city walls, and so place the Romans\r\nbetween two fires. Cominius divided his army, and led one part of it to\r\nfight the relieving force, leaving Titus Lartius, a man of the noblest\r\nbirth in Rome, to continue the siege with the rest of his troops. The\r\ngarrison of Corioli, despising the small numbers of their besiegers,\r\nattacked them and forced them to take shelter within their camp. But\r\nthere Marcius with a few followers checked their onset, slew the\r\nforemost, and with a loud voice called on the Romans to rally. He was,\r\nas Cato said a soldier should be, not merely able to deal weighty blows,\r\nbut struck terror into his enemies by the loud tones of his voice and\r\nhis martial appearance, so that few dared to stand their ground before\r\nhim. Many soldiers rallied round him and forced the enemy to retreat;\r\nbut he, not satisfied with this, followed them close and drove them in\r\nheadlong flight back to the city. On arriving there, although he saw\r\nthat the Romans were slackening their pursuit as many missiles were\r\naimed at them from the city walls, and none of them thought of daring to\r\nenter together with the fugitives into a city full of armed men, yet he\r\nstood and cheered them on, loudly telling them that fortune had opened\r\nthe city gates as much to the pursuers as to the pursued. Few cared to\r\nfollow him, but he, forcing his way through the crowd of fugitives,\r\nentered the city with them, none daring at first to withstand him. Soon,\r\nwhen the enemy saw how few of the Romans were within the gates, they\r\nrallied and attacked them. Marcius, in the confused mass of friends and\r\nfoes, fought with incredible strength, swiftness, and courage,\r\noverthrowing all whom he attacked, driving some to the further parts of\r\nthe town, and forcing others to lay down their arms, so that Lartius was\r\nable to march the rest of the Roman army into the gates unmolested.\r\n\r\nIX. When the city was taken, the greater part of the soldiers fell to\r\nplundering it, which greatly vexed Marcius. He loudly exclaimed that it\r\nwas a disgraceful thing, when the consul was on the point of engaging\r\nwith the enemy, that they should be plundering, or, on the pretext of\r\nplunder, keeping themselves safe out of harm's way. Few paid any\r\nattention to him, but with those few he marched on the track of the main\r\nbody, frequently encouraging his followers to greater speed, and not to\r\ngive way to fatigue, and frequently praying to Heaven that he might not\r\ncome too late for the battle, but arrive in time to share the labours\r\nand perils of his countrymen. There was at that time a custom among the\r\nRomans, when they were drawn up in order of battle, ready to take their\r\nshields in their hands, and to gird themselves with the trabea, to make\r\ntheir will verbally, naming their heir in the presence of three or four\r\nwitnesses. The Roman army was found by Marcius in the act of performing\r\nthis ceremony. At first some were alarmed at seeing him appear with only\r\na few followers, covered with blood and sweat; but when he ran joyously\r\nup to the consul and told him that Corioli was taken, Cominius embraced\r\nhim, and all the ranks took fresh courage, some because they heard, and\r\nothers because they guessed the glorious news. They eagerly demanded to\r\nbe led to battle. Marcius now enquired of Cominius how the enemy's line\r\nof battle was arranged, and where it was strongest. When the consul\r\nanswered that he believed that the men of Antium, the proudest and\r\nbravest troops of the Volscians, were posted in the centre, he answered,\r\n\"I beg of you, place us opposite to those men.\" The consul, filled with\r\nadmiration for his spirit, placed him there. As soon as the armies met,\r\nMarcius charged before the rest, and the Volscians gave way before his\r\nonset. The centre, where he attacked, was quite broken, but the ranks on\r\neither side wheeled round and surrounded him, so that the consul feared\r\nfor his safety, and despatched the choicest of his own troops to his\r\naid. They found a hot battle raging round Marcius, and many slain, but\r\nby the shock of their charge they drove off the enemy in confusion. As\r\nthey began to pursue them, they begged Marcius, now weary with toil and\r\nwounds, to retire to the camp, but he, saying that \"it was not for\r\nvictors to be weary,\" joined in the pursuit. The rest of the Volscian\r\narmy was defeated, many were slain, and many taken.\r\n\r\nX. On the next day Lartius and the rest joined the consul. He ascended a\r\nrostrum, and after returning suitable thanks to Heaven for such\r\nunexampled successes, turned to Marcius. First he praised his conduct in\r\nthe highest terms, having himself witnessed some part of it, and having\r\nlearned the rest from Lartius. Next, as there were many prisoners,\r\nhorses, and other spoil, he bade him, before it was divided, choose a\r\ntenth part for himself. He also presented him with a horse and\r\ntrappings, as a reward for his bravery. As all the Romans murmured their\r\napproval, Marcius coming forward said that he gladly accepted the horse,\r\nand was thankful for the praise which he had received from the consul.\r\nAs for the rest, he considered that to be mere pay, not a prize, and\r\nrefused it, preferring to take his share with the rest. \"One especial\r\nfavour,\" said he, \"I do beg of you. I had a friend among the Volscians,\r\nwho now is a captive, and from having been a rich and free man has\r\nfallen to the condition of a slave. I wish to relieve him from one of\r\nhis many misfortunes--that of losing his liberty and being sold for a\r\nslave.\" After these words, Marcius was cheered more than he had been\r\nbefore, and men admired his disinterestedness more than they had admired\r\nhis bravery. Even those who grudged him his extraordinary honours now\r\nthought that by his unselfishness he had shown himself worthy of them,\r\nand admired his courage in refusing such presents more than the courage\r\nby which he had won the right to them. Indeed, the right use of riches\r\nis more glorious than that of arms, but not to desire them at all is\r\nbetter even than using them well.\r\n\r\nXI. When the cheering caused by Marcius's speech had subsided, Cominius\r\nsaid: \"Fellow soldiers, we cannot force a man against his will to\r\nreceive these presents; but, unless his achievements have already won it\r\nfor him, let us give him the title of Coriolanus, which he cannot\r\nrefuse, seeing for what it is bestowed, and let us confirm it by a\r\ngeneral vote.\"\r\n\r\nHence he obtained the third name of Coriolanus. From this we may clearly\r\nsee that his own personal name was Caius, and that Marcius was the\r\ncommon name of his family, while the third name was added afterwards to\r\nmark some particular exploit, peculiarity, or virtue in the bearer. So\r\nalso did the Greeks in former ages give men names derived from their\r\nactions, such as Kallinikus (the Victor), or Soter (the Preserver); or\r\nfrom their appearance, as Fusco (the Fat), or Gripus (the Hook-nosed);\r\nor from their virtues, as Euergetes (the Benefactor), or Philadelphus\r\n(the Lover of his Brethren), which were names of the Ptolemies: or from\r\ntheir success, as Eudaemon (the Fortunate), a name given to the second\r\nking of the race of Battus. Some princes have even had names given them\r\nin jest, as Antigonus was called Doson (the Promiser), and Ptolemy\r\nLathyrus (the Vetch).\r\n\r\nThe Romans used this sort of name much more commonly, as for instance\r\nthey named one of the Metelli Diadematus, or wearer of the diadem,\r\nbecause he walked about for a long time with his head bound up because\r\nof a wound in the forehead.\r\n\r\nAnother of the same family was named Celer (the Swift), because of the\r\nwonderful quickness with which he provided a show of gladiators on the\r\noccasion of his father's funeral. Some even to the present day derive\r\ntheir names from the circumstances of their birth, as for instance a\r\nchild is named Proculus if his father be abroad when he is born, and\r\nPostumus if he be dead. If one of twins survive, he is named Vopiscus.\r\nOf names taken from bodily peculiarities they use not only Sulla (the\r\nPimply), Niger (the Swarthy), Rufus (the Red-haired), but even such as\r\nCaecus (the Blind), and Claudus (the Lame), wisely endeavouring to\r\naccustom men to consider neither blindness nor any other bodily defect\r\nto be any disgrace or matter of reproach, but to answer to these names\r\nas if they were their own. However, this belongs to a different branch\r\nof study.\r\n\r\nXII. When the war was over, the popular orators renewed the\r\nparty-quarrels, not that they had any new cause of complaint or any just\r\ngrievance to proceed upon; but the evil result which had necessarily\r\nbeen produced by their former riotous contests were now made the ground\r\nof attacks on the patricians. A great part of the country was left\r\nunsown and untilled, while the war gave no opportunities for importation\r\nfrom other countries. The demagogues, therefore, seeing that there was\r\nno corn in the market, and that even if there had been any, the people\r\nwere not able to buy it, spread malicious accusations against the rich,\r\nsaying that they had purposely produced this famine in order to pay off\r\nan old grudge against the people. At this juncture ambassadors arrived\r\nfrom the town of Velitrae, who delivered up their city to the Romans,\r\ndesiring that they would send some new inhabitants to people it, as a\r\npestilence had made such havoc among the citizens that there was\r\nscarcely a tenth part of them remaining alive.\r\n\r\nThe wiser Romans thought that this demand of the people of Velitrae\r\nwould confer a most seasonable relief on themselves, and would put an\r\nend to their domestic troubles, if they could only transfer the more\r\nviolent partizans of the popular party thither, and so purge the State\r\nof its more disorderly elements. The consuls accordingly chose out all\r\nthese men and sent them to colonize Velitrae, and enrolled the rest for\r\na campaign against the Volsci, that they might not have leisure for\r\nrevolutionary plottings, but that when they were all gathered together,\r\nrich and poor, patrician and plebeian alike, to share in the common\r\ndangers of a camp, they might learn to regard one another with less\r\nhatred and illwill.\r\n\r\nXIII. But Sicinnius and Brutus, the tribunes of the people, now\r\ninterposed, crying aloud that the consuls were veiling a most barbarous\r\naction under the specious name of sending out colonists. They were\r\ndespatching many poor men to certain destruction by transporting them to\r\na city whose air was full of pestilence and the stench from unburied\r\ncorpses, where they were to dwell under the auspices of a god who was\r\nnot only not their own, but angry with them. And after that, as if it\r\nwas not sufficient for them that some of the citizens should be starved,\r\nand others be exposed to the plague, they must needs plunge wantonly\r\ninto war, in order that the city might suffer every conceivable misery\r\nat once, because it had refused any longer to remain in slavery to the\r\nrich. Excited by these speeches, the people would not enrol themselves\r\nas soldiers for the war, and looked with suspicion on the proposal for\r\nthe new colony. The Senate was greatly perplexed, but Marcius, now a\r\nperson of great importance and very highly thought of in the State,\r\nbegan to place himself in direct opposition to the popular leaders, and\r\nto support the patrician cause. In spite of the efforts of the\r\ndemagogues, a colony was sent out to Velitrae, those whose names were\r\ndrawn by lot being compelled by heavy penalties to go thither; but as\r\nthe people utterly refused to serve in the campaign against the\r\nVolscians, Marcius made up a troop of his own clients, with which and\r\nwhat others he could persuade to join him he made an inroad into the\r\nterritory of Antium. Here he found much corn, and captured many\r\nprisoners and much cattle. He kept none of it for himself, but returned\r\nto Rome with his troops loaded with plunder. This caused the others to\r\nrepent of their determination, when they saw the wealth which these men\r\nhad obtained, but it embittered their hatred of Marcius, whom they\r\nregarded as gaining glory for himself at the expense of the people.\r\n\r\nXIV. Shortly after this, however, Marcius stood for the consulship, and\r\nthen the people relented and felt ashamed to affront such a man, first\r\nin arms as in place, and the author of so many benefits to the State. It\r\nwas the custom at Rome for those who were candidates for any office to\r\naddress and ingratiate themselves with the people, going about the Forum\r\nin a toga without any tunic underneath it, either in order to show their\r\nhumility by such a dress, or else in order to display the wounds which\r\nthey had received, in token of their valour. At that early period there\r\ncould be no suspicion of bribery, and it was not for that reason that\r\nthe citizens wished their candidates to come down among them ungirt and\r\nwithout a tunic. It was not till long afterwards that votes were bought\r\nand sold, and that a candidature became an affair of money. This habit\r\nof receiving bribes, when once introduced, spread to the courts of\r\njustice and to the armies of the commonwealth, and finally brought the\r\ncity under the despotic rule of the emperors, as the power of arms was\r\nnot equal to that of money. For it was well said that he who first\r\nintroduced the habit of feasting and bribing voters ruined the\r\nconstitution. This plague crept secretly and silently into Rome, and was\r\nfor a long time undiscovered. We cannot tell who was the first to bribe\r\nthe people or the courts of law at Rome. At Athens it is said that the\r\nfirst man who gave money to the judges for his acquittal was Anytus the\r\nson of Anthemion, when he was tried for treachery at Pylos towards the\r\nend of the Peloponnesian War, a period when men of uncorrupted\r\nsimplicity and virtue were still to be found in the Forum at Rome.\r\n\r\nXV. Marcius displayed many scars, gained in the numerous battles in\r\nwhich for seventeen years in succession he had always taken a prominent\r\npart. The people were abashed at these evidences of his valour, and\r\nagreed among themselves that they would return him as consul. But when,\r\non the day of election, he appeared in the Forum, escorted by a splendid\r\nprocession of the entire Senate, and all the patricians were seen\r\ncollected round him evidently intent upon obtaining his election, many\r\nof the people lost their feeling of goodwill towards him, and regarded\r\nhim with indignation and envy; which passions were assisted by their\r\nfear lest, if a man of such aristocratic tendencies and such influence\r\nwith the patricians should obtain power, he might altogether destroy the\r\nliberties of the people. For these reasons they did not elect Marcius.\r\nWhen two persons had been elected consuls, the Senate was much\r\nirritated, considering that it, rather than its candidate Marcius, had\r\nbeen insulted, while he was much enraged, and could not bear his\r\ndisgrace with any temper or patience, being accustomed always to yield\r\nto the more violent and ferocious emotions as being the more spirited\r\ncourse, without any mixture of gravity and self-restraint, virtues so\r\nnecessary for political life. He had never learned how essential it is\r\nfor one who undertakes to deal with men, and engage in public business,\r\nto avoid above all things that self-will which, as Plato says, is of the\r\nfamily of solitude, and to become longsuffering and patient, qualities\r\nwhich some foolish people hold very cheap. Marcius, plain and\r\nstraightforward, thinking it to be the duty of a brave man to bear down\r\nall opposition, and not reflecting that it is rather a sign of weakness\r\nand feebleness of mind to be unable to restrain one's passion, flung\r\naway in a rage, bitterly irritated against the people. The young\r\naristocracy of Rome, who had ever been his fast friends, now did him an\r\nill service by encouraging and exasperating his anger by their\r\nexpressions of sympathy; for he was their favourite leader and a most\r\nkind instructor in the art of war when on a campaign, as he taught them\r\nto delight in deeds of prowess without envying and grudging one another\r\ntheir proper meed of praise.\r\n\r\nXVI. While this was the state of affairs at Rome, a large amount of corn\r\narrived there, some of which had been bought in Italy, but most of it\r\nsent as a present from Sicily by Gelon the despot; which gave most men\r\nhopes that the famine would come to an end, and that the quarrel between\r\nthe patricians and plebeians would, under these improved circumstances,\r\nbe made up. The Senate at once assembled, and the people eagerly waited\r\noutside the doors of the senate house, expecting and hoping that prices\r\nwould be lowered, and that the present of corn would be distributed\r\ngratis among them; and indeed some of the senators advised the adoption\r\nof that course. Marcius, however, rose and bitterly inveighed against\r\nthose who favoured the people, calling them demagogues and betrayers of\r\ntheir own order, alleging that by such gratification they did but\r\ncherish that spirit of boldness and arrogance which had been spread\r\namong the people against the patricians, which they would have done well\r\nto crush upon its first appearance, and not suffer the plebeians to grow\r\nso strong by giving so much power to the tribunes of the people. Now, he\r\nurged, they had become formidable because every demand they made had\r\nbeen agreed to, and nothing done against their wishes; they contemned\r\nthe authority of the consuls, and lived in defiance of the constitution,\r\ngoverned only by their own seditious ringleaders, to whom they gave the\r\ntitle of tribunes. For the Senate to sit and decree largesses of corn to\r\nthe populace, as is done in the most democratic States in Greece, would\r\nmerely be to pay them for their disobedience, to the common ruin of all\r\nclasses. \"They cannot,\" he went on to say, \"consider this largess of\r\ncorn to be a reward for the campaign in which they have refused to\r\nserve, or for the secession by which they betrayed their country, or the\r\nscandals which they have been so willing to believe against the Senate.\r\nAs they cannot be said to deserve this bounty, they will imagine that it\r\nhas been bestowed upon them by you because you fear them, and wish to\r\npay your court to them. In this case there will be no bounds to their\r\ninsubordination, and they never will cease from riots and disorders. To\r\ngive it them is clearly an insane proceeding; nay, we ought rather, if\r\nwe are wise, to take away from them this privilege of the tribuneship,\r\nwhich is a distinct subversion of the consulate, and a cause of\r\ndissension in the city, which now is no longer one, as before, but is\r\nrent asunder in such a manner that there is no prospect of our ever\r\nbeing reunited, and ceasing to be divided into two hostile factions.\"\r\n\r\nXVII. With much talk to this effect Marcius excited the young men, with\r\nwhom he was influential, and nearly all the richer classes, who loudly\r\ndeclared that he was the only man in the State who was insensible both\r\nto force and to flattery. Some of the elders, however, opposed him,\r\nforeseeing what would be the result of his policy. Indeed, no good\r\nresulted from it. The tribunes of the people, as soon as they heard that\r\nMarcius had carried his point, rushed down into the forum and called\r\nloudly upon the people to assemble and stand by them. A disorderly\r\nassembly took place, and on a report being made of Marcius's speech, the\r\nfury of the people was so great that it was proposed to break into the\r\nsenate house; but the tribunes turned all the blame upon Marcius alone,\r\nand sent for him to come and speak in his own defence. As this demand\r\nwas insolently refused, the tribunes themselves, together with the\r\naediles, went to bring him by force, and actually laid hands upon him.\r\nHowever, the patricians rallied round him, thrust away the tribunes of\r\nthe people, and even beat the aediles, their assistants in this quarrel.\r\nNight put an end to the conflict, but at daybreak the consuls, seeing\r\nthe people terribly excited, and gathering in the forum from all\r\nquarters, began to fear the consequences of their fury. They assembled\r\nthe senators and bade them endeavour, by mild language and healing\r\nmeasures, to pacify the multitude, as it was no season for pride or for\r\nstanding upon their dignity, but if they were wise they would perceive\r\nthat so dangerous and critical a posture of affairs required a temperate\r\nand popular policy. The majority of the senators yielded, and the\r\nconsuls proceeded to soothe the people in the best way they could,\r\nanswering gently such charges as had been brought against them, even\r\nspeaking with the utmost caution when blaming the people for their late\r\noutrageous conduct, and declaring that there should be no difference of\r\nopinion between them about the way in which corn should be supplied, and\r\nabout the price of provisions.\r\n\r\nXVIII. As the people now for the most part had cooled down, and from\r\ntheir attentive and orderly demeanour were evidently much wrought upon\r\nby the words of the consuls, the tribunes came forward and addressed\r\nthem. They said that now that the Senate had come to a better frame of\r\nmind, the people would willingly make concessions in their turn; but\r\nthey insisted that Marcius should apologise for his conduct, or deny if\r\nhe could that he had excited the Senate to destroy the constitution,\r\nthat when summoned to appear he had disobeyed, and that finally he had,\r\nby beating and insulting the aediles in the market-place, done all that\r\nlay in his power to raise a civil war and make the citizens shed one\r\nanother's blood. Their object in saying this was either to humble\r\nMarcius, by making him entreat the clemency of the people, which was\r\nmuch against his haughty temper, or else expecting that he would yield\r\nto his fiery nature and make the breach between himself and the people\r\nincurable. The latter was what they hoped for from their knowledge of\r\nhis character.\r\n\r\nMarcius came forward to speak in his defence, and the people stood\r\nlistening in dead silence. But when, instead of the apologetic speech\r\nwhich they expected, he began to speak with a freedom which seemed more\r\nlike accusing them than defending himself, while the tones of his voice\r\nand the expression of his countenance showed a fearless contempt for his\r\naudience, the people became angry, and plainly showed their\r\ndisapprobation of what he said. Upon this, Sicinnius, the boldest of the\r\ntribunes, after a short consultation with his colleagues, came forward\r\nand said that the tribunes had condemned Marcius to suffer the penalty\r\nof death, and ordered the aediles to lead him at once to the Capitol,\r\nand cast him down the Tarpeian rock. When the aediles laid hold of him,\r\nmany of the people themselves seemed struck with horror and remorse, and\r\nthe patricians in the wildest excitement, called upon one another to\r\nrescue him, and by main force tore him from his assailants and placed\r\nhim in the midst of themselves. Some of them held out their hands and\r\nbesought the populace by signs, as no voice could be heard in such an\r\nuproar. At last the friends and relations of the tribunes, seeing that\r\nit was impossible to carry out their sentence on Marcius without much\r\nbloodshed, persuaded them to alter the cruel and unprecedented part of\r\nthe sentence, and not to put him to death by violence, or without a\r\ntrial, but to refer the matter to the people, to be voted upon by them.\r\nUpon this Sicinnius, turning to the patricians, demanded what they meant\r\nby rescuing Marcius from the people when they intended to punish him.\r\nThey at once retorted, \"Nay, what do you mean by dragging one of the\r\nbravest and best men in Rome to a cruel and illegal death?\" \"You shall\r\nnot,\" answered Sicinnius, \"make that a ground of quarrel with the\r\npeople, for we allow you what you demand, that this man be put on his\r\ntrial. You, Marcius, we summon to appear in the forum on the third\r\nmarket-day ensuing, and prove your innocence if you can, as the votes of\r\nyour countrymen will be then taken about your conduct.\"\r\n\r\nXIX. The patricians were glad enough to terminate the affair in this\r\nway, and retired rejoicing, bearing Marcius with them. During the time\r\nwhich was to elapse before the third market-day (which the Romans hold\r\non every ninth day, and therefore call them nundinae), they had some\r\nhope that a campaign against the people of Antium would enable them to\r\nput off the trial until the people's anger had abated through length of\r\ntime and warlike occupations; afterwards, as they came to terms at once\r\nwith the Antiates, the patricians held frequent meetings, in which they\r\nexpressed their fear of the people, and considered by what means they\r\ncould avoid delivering Marcius up to them, and prevent their mob orators\r\nfrom exciting them. Appius Claudius, who had the reputation of being the\r\nbitterest enemy of the people in Rome, gave it as his opinion that the\r\nSenate would destroy itself and ruin the State utterly if it permitted\r\nthe people to assume the power of trying patricians and voting on their\r\ntrials; while the older men, and those who were more inclined to the\r\npopular side, thought that this power would render the people gentle and\r\ntemperate, and not savage and cruel. The people, they said, did not\r\ndespise the Senate, but imagined that they were despised by it, so that\r\nthis privilege of holding the trial would agreeably salve their wounded\r\nvanity, and, as they exercised their franchise, they would lay aside\r\ntheir anger.\r\n\r\nXX. Marcius, perceiving that the Senate, divided between their regard\r\nfor himself and their fear of the people, knew not what to do, himself\r\nasked the tribunes of the people what it was that he was charged with,\r\nand what indictment they intended to bring against him at his trial.\r\nWhen they answered that the charge against him was one of treason,\r\nbecause he had attempted to make himself absolute despot in Rome, and\r\nthat they would prove it, he at once rose, saying that he would at once\r\ndefend himself before the people on that score, and that if he were\r\nconvicted, he would not refuse to undergo any punishment whatever;\r\n\"Only,\" said he, \"do not bring forward some other charge against me, and\r\ndeceive the Senate.\" When they had agreed upon these conditions, the\r\ntrial took place.\r\n\r\nThe tribunes, however, when the people assembled, made them vote by\r\ntribes, and not by centuries;[A] by which device the votes of rich\r\nrespectable men who had served the State in the wars would be swamped by\r\nthose of the needy rabble who cared nothing for truth or honour. In the\r\nnext place, they passed by the charge of treason, as being impossible to\r\nprove, and repeated what Marcius had originally said before the Senate,\r\nwhen he dissuaded them from lowering the price of corn, and advised the\r\nabolition of the office of tribune. A new count in the indictment was\r\nthat he had not paid over the money raised by the sale of the plunder\r\nafter his expedition against Antium, but had divided it among his own\r\nfollowers. This last accusation is said to have disturbed Marcius more\r\nthan all the rest, as he had never expected it, and was not prepared\r\nwith any answer that would satisfy the people, so that the praises which\r\nhe bestowed on those who had made that campaign with him only angered\r\nthe far greater number who had not done so. At last the people voted.\r\nMarcius was condemned by a majority of the tribes, and was sentenced to\r\nperpetual banishment. After sentence was passed, the people displayed\r\ngreater joy than if they had won a pitched battle, while the Senate was\r\ndowncast and filled with regret at not having run any risks rather than\r\nallow the people to obtain so much power, and use it so insolently. Nor\r\nwas there any need for distinctions of dress or anything else to\r\ndistinguish the two parties, because a plebeian might be told at once by\r\nhis delight, a patrician by his sorrow.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: See the article \"Comitia\" in Dr. Smith's Dictionary of\r\nAntiquities.]\r\n\r\nXXI. Marcius himself, however, remained unmoved. Proud and haughty as\r\never, he appeared not to be sorry for himself, and to be the only one of\r\nthe patricians who was not. This calmness, however, was not due to any\r\nevenness of temper or any intention of bearing his wrongs meekly. It\r\narose from concentrated rage and fury, which many do not know to be an\r\nexpression of great grief. When the mind is inflamed with this passion,\r\nit casts out all ideas of submission or of quiet. Hence an angry man is\r\ncourageous, just as a fever patient is hot, because of the inflamed\r\nthrobbing excitement of his mind. And Marcius soon showed that this was\r\nhis own condition. He went home, embraced his weeping wife and mother,\r\nbade them bear this calamity with patience, and at once proceeded to the\r\ncity gates, escorted by the patricians in a body. Thence, taking nothing\r\nwith him, and asking no man for any thing, he went off, accompanied by\r\nthree or four of his clients. He remained for a few days at some farms\r\nnear the city, agitated deeply by conflicting passions. His anger\r\nsuggested no scheme by which he might benefit himself, but only how to\r\nrevenge himself on the Romans. At length he decided that he would raise\r\nup a cruel war against them, and proceeded at once to make application\r\nto the neighbouring nation of the Volscians, whom he knew to be rich and\r\npowerful, and only to have suffered sufficiently by their late defeats\r\nto make them desirous of renewing their quarrel with Rome.\r\n\r\nXXII. There was a certain citizen of Antium named Tullus Aufidius, who,\r\nfrom his wealth, courage, and noble birth, was regarded as the most\r\nimportant man in the whole Volscian nation. Marcius knew that this man\r\nhated him more than any other Roman; for in battle they had often met,\r\nand by challenging and defying one another, as young warriors are wont\r\nto do, they had, in addition to their national antipathy, gained a\r\nviolent personal hatred for one another. In spite of this, however,\r\nknowing the generous nature of Tullus, and longing more than any\r\nVolscian to requite the Romans for their treatment, he justified the\r\nverses,\r\n\r\n    \"'Tis hard to strive with rage, which aye,\r\n    Though life's the forfeit, gains its way.\"\r\n\r\nHe disguised himself as completely as he could, and, like Ulysses,\r\n\r\n    \"Into the city of his foes he came.\"\r\n\r\nXXIII. It was evening when he entered Antium, and although many met him,\r\nno one recognised him. He went to Tullus's house, and entering, sat down\r\nby the hearth in silence, with his head wrapped in his cloak. The\r\ndomestics, astonished at his behaviour, did not dare to disturb him, as\r\nthere was a certain dignity about his appearance and his silence, but\r\nwent and told Tullus, who was at supper, of this strange incident.\r\nTullus rose, went to him, and inquired who he was and what he wanted.\r\nThen at length Marcius uncovered his face, and, after a short pause,\r\nsaid, \"If you do not recognise me, Tullus, or if you do not believe your\r\neyes, I must myself tell you who I am. I am Caius Marcius, who has\r\nwrought you and the Volscians more mischief than any one else, and who,\r\nlest I should deny this, have received the additional title of\r\nCoriolanus. This I cannot lose: every thing else has been taken from me\r\nby the envious spite of the people, and the treacherous remissness of\r\nthe upper classes. I am an exile, and I now sit as a suppliant on your\r\nhearth, begging you, not for safety or protection, for should I have\r\ncome hither if I feared to die, but for vengeance against those who\r\ndrove me forth, which I am already beginning to receive by putting\r\nmyself in your hands. If then, my brave Tullus, you wish to attack your\r\nfoes, make use of my misfortunes, and let my disgrace be the common\r\nhappiness of all the Volscians. I shall fight for you much better than I\r\nhave fought against you, because I have the advantage of knowing exactly\r\nthe strength and weakness of the enemy. If, however, you are tired of\r\nwar, I have no wish for life, nor is it to your credit to save the life\r\nof one who once was your personal enemy, and who now is worn out and\r\nuseless.\" Tullus was greatly delighted with this speech, and giving him\r\nhis right hand, answered, \"Rise, Marcius, and be of good courage. You\r\nhave brought us a noble present, yourself; rest assured that the\r\nVolscians will not be ungrateful.\" He then feasted Marcius with great\r\nhospitality, and for some days they conferred together as to the best\r\nmethod of carrying on the war.\r\n\r\nXXIV. Rome meanwhile was disturbed by the anger of the patricians\r\ntowards the plebeians, especially on account of the banishment of\r\nMarcius, and by many portents which were observed both by the priests\r\nand by private persons, one of which was as follows. There was one Titus\r\nLatinus, a man of no great note, but a respectable citizen and by no\r\nmeans addicted to superstition. He dreamed that he saw Jupiter face to\r\nface, and that the god bade him tell the Senate that \"they had sent a\r\nbad dancer before his procession, and one who was very displeasing to\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nOn first seeing this vision he said that he disregarded it; but after it\r\nhad occurred a second and a third time he had the unhappiness to see his\r\nson sicken and die, while he himself suddenly lost the use of his limbs.\r\n\r\nHe told this story in the senate house, to which he had been carried on\r\na litter; and as soon as he had told it, he found his bodily strength\r\nreturn, rose, and walked home.\r\n\r\nThe senators, greatly astonished, inquired into the matter. It was found\r\nthat a slave, convicted of some crime, had been ordered by his master to\r\nbe flogged through the market-place, and then put to death. While this\r\nwas being done, and the wretch was twisting his body in every kind of\r\ncontortion as he writhed under the blows, the procession by chance was\r\nfollowing after him. Many of those who walked in it were shocked at the\r\nunseemliness of the spectacle, and disgusted at its inhumanity, but no\r\none did anything more than reproach and execrate a man who treated his\r\nslaves with so much cruelty.\r\n\r\nAt that period men treated their slaves with great kindness, because\r\nthe master himself worked and ate in their company, and so could\r\nsympathise more with them. The great punishment for a slave who had done\r\nwrong was to make him carry round the neighbourhood the piece of wood on\r\nwhich the pole of a waggon is rested. The slave who has done this and\r\nbeen seen by the neighbours and friends, lost his credit, and was called\r\n_furcifer_, for the Romans call that piece of timber _furca_, \"a fork,\"\r\nwhich the Greeks call _hypostates_, \"a supporter.\"\r\n\r\nXXV. So when Latinus related his dream to the senators, and they were\r\nwondering who the bad and unacceptable dancer could be who had led the\r\nprocession, some of them remembered the slave who had been flogged\r\nthrough the market-place and there put to death. At the instance of the\r\npriests, the master of the slave was punished for his cruelty, and the\r\nprocession and ceremonies were performed anew in honour of the gods.\r\nHence we may see how wisely Numa arranged this, among other matters of\r\nceremonial. Whenever the magistrates or priests were engaged in any\r\nreligious rite, a herald walked before them crying in a loud voice \"_Hoc\r\nage_.\" The meaning of the phrase is, \"Do this,\" meaning to tell the\r\npeople to apply their minds entirely to the religious ceremony, and not\r\nto allow any thought of worldly things to distract their attention,\r\nbecause men as a rule only attend to such matters by putting a certain\r\nconstraint on their thoughts.\r\n\r\nIt is the custom in Rome to begin a sacrifice, a procession, or a\r\nspectacle, over again, not only when anything of this kind happens, but\r\nfor any trifling reason. Thus, if one of the horses drawing the sacred\r\ncar called Thensa stumbles, or the charioteer takes the reins in his\r\nleft hand, they have decreed that the procession must begin again. In\r\nlater times they have been known to perform one sacrifice thirty times,\r\nbecause every time some slight omission or mistake took place.\r\n\r\nXXVI. Meanwhile Marcius and Tullus in Antium held private conferences\r\nwith the chief men of the Volscians, and advised them to begin the war\r\nwhile Rome was divided by its domestic quarrels. They discountenanced\r\nthis proposal, because a truce and cessation of hostilities for two\r\nyears had been agreed upon: but the Romans themselves gave them a\r\npretext for breaking the truce, by a proclamation which was made at the\r\npublic games, that all Volscians should quit the city before sunset.\r\nSome say this was effected by a stratagem of Marcius, who sent a false\r\naccusation against the Volscians to the magistrates at Rome, saying that\r\nduring the public games they meant to attack the Romans and burn the\r\ncity. This proclamation made them yet bitterer enemies to the Romans\r\nthan before; and Tullus, wishing to bring the business to a climax,\r\ninduced his countrymen to send ambassadors to Rome to demand back the\r\ncities and territory which the Romans had taken from the Volscians in\r\nthe late war. The Romans were very indignant when they heard these\r\ndemands, and made answer, that the Volscians might be the first to take\r\nup arms, but that the Romans would be the last to lay them down. Upon\r\nthis, Tullus convoked a general assembly, in which, after determining\r\nupon war, he advised them to summon Marcius to their aid, not owing him\r\nany grudge for what they had suffered at his hands, but believing that\r\nhe would be more valuable to them as a friend than he had been dangerous\r\nas an enemy.\r\n\r\nXXVII. Marcius was called before the assembly, and having addressed the\r\npeople, was thought by them to know how to speak as well as how to\r\nfight, and was considered to be a man of great ability and courage. He,\r\ntogether with Tullus, was nominated general with unlimited powers. As he\r\nfeared the Volscians would take a long time to prepare for the war, and\r\nthat meanwhile the opportunity for attack might pass away, he ordered\r\nthe leading men in the city to make all necessary preparations, and\r\nhimself taking the boldest and most forward as volunteers, without\r\nlevying any troops by compulsory conscription, made a sudden and\r\nunexpected inroad into the Roman territory. Here he obtained so much\r\nplunder that the Volscians were wearied with carrying it off and\r\nconsuming it in their camp. However, his least object was to obtain\r\nplunder and lay waste the country; his main desire was to render the\r\npatricians suspected by the people. While all else was ravaged and\r\ndestroyed, he carefully protected their farms, and would not allow any\r\ndamage to be done or anything to be carried off from them. This\r\nincreased the disorders at Rome, the patricians reproaching the people\r\nfor having unjustly banished so able a man, while the plebeians accused\r\nthem of having invited Marcius to attack in order to obtain their\r\nrevenge, and said that, while others fought, they sat as idle\r\nspectators, having in the war itself a sure safeguard of their wealth\r\nand estates. Having produced this new quarrel among the Romans, and,\r\nbesides loading the Volscians with plunder, having taught them to\r\ndespise their enemy, Marcius led his troops back in safety.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. By great and zealous exertions the entire Volscian nation was\r\nsoon assembled under arms. The force thus raised was very large; part\r\nwas left to garrison the cities, as a measure of precaution, while the\r\nrest was to be used in the campaign against Rome. Marcius now left\r\nTullus to determine which corps he would command. Tullus, in answer,\r\nsaid that as Marcius, he knew, was as brave a man as himself, and had\r\nalways enjoyed better fortune in all his battles, he had better command\r\nthe army in the field. He himself, he added, would remain behind, watch\r\nover the safety of the Volscian cities, and supply the troops with\r\nnecessaries. Marcius, strengthened by this division of the command,\r\nmarched to the town of Circeii, a Roman colony. As it surrendered, he\r\ndid it no harm, but laid waste the country of Latium, where he expected\r\nthe Romans would fight a battle in defence of their allies the Latins,\r\nwho frequently sent to entreat their protection. But at Rome the people\r\nwere unwilling to fight, and the consuls were just at the expiry of\r\ntheir term of office, so that they did not care to run any risks, and\r\ntherefore rejected the appeals of the Latins. Marcius now led his troops\r\nagainst the Latian cities, Tolerium, Labici, Pedum, and Bola, all of\r\nwhich he took by storm, sold the inhabitants for slaves, and plundered\r\nthe houses. Those cities, however, which voluntarily came to his side he\r\ntreated with the utmost consideration, even pitching his camp at a\r\ndistance, for fear they might be injured by the soldiery against his\r\nwill, and never plundering their territory.\r\n\r\nXXIX. When at last he took Bollae, a town not more than twelve miles\r\nfrom Rome, obtaining immense booty and putting nearly all the adult\r\ninhabitants to the sword, then not even those Volscians who had been\r\nappointed to garrison the cities would any longer remain at their posts,\r\nbut seized their arms and joined the army of Marcius, declaring that he\r\nwas their only general, and that they would recognise no other leader.\r\nHis renown and glory spread throughout all Italy, and all men were\r\nastonished that one man by changing sides should have produced so great\r\na change. The affairs of Rome were in the last disorder, the people\r\nrefusing to fight, while internal quarrels and seditious speeches took\r\nplace daily, until news came that Lavinium was being invested by the\r\nenemy. This town contains the most ancient images and sacred things of\r\nthe tutelary deities of Rome, and is the origin of the Roman people,\r\nbeing the first town founded by Aeneas.\r\n\r\nUpon this a very singular change of opinions befel both the people and\r\nthe Senate. The people were eager to annul their sentence against\r\nMarcius, and to beg him to return, but the Senate, after meeting and\r\nconsidering this proposal, finally rejected it, either out of a mere\r\nspirit of opposition to anything proposed by the people, or because they\r\ndid not wish him to return by favour of the people; or it may be because\r\nthey themselves were now angry with him for having shown himself the\r\nenemy of all classes alike, although he had only been injured by one,\r\nand for having become the avowed enemy of his country, in which he knew\r\nthat the best and noblest all sympathised with him, and had suffered\r\nalong with him. When this resolution was made known to the people, they\r\nwere unable to proceed to vote or to pass any bill on the subject,\r\nwithout a previous decree of the Senate.\r\n\r\nXXX. Marcius when he heard of this was more exasperated than ever. He\r\nraised his siege of Lavinium, marched straight upon Rome, and pitched\r\nhis camp five miles from the city, at the place called _Fossae\r\nCluiliae_. The appearance of his army caused much terror and\r\ndisturbance, but nevertheless put an end to sedition, for no magistrate\r\nor patrician dared any longer oppose the people's desire to recall him.\r\nWhen they beheld the women running distractedly through the city, the\r\nold men weeping and praying at the altars, and no one able to take\r\ncourage and form any plan of defence, it was agreed that the people had\r\nbeen right in wishing to come to terms with Marcius, and that the Senate\r\nhad committed a fatal error in inflicting a new outrage upon him, just\r\nat the time when all unkindness might have been buried. It was\r\ndetermined, therefore, by the whole city that an embassy should be\r\ndespatched to Marcius, to offer him restoration to his own country, and\r\nto beg of him to make peace. Those of the Senate who were sent were\r\nrelations of Marcius, and expected to be warmly welcomed by a man who\r\nwas their near relation and personal friend. Nothing of the kind,\r\nhowever, happened. They were conducted through the enemy's camp, and\r\nfound him seated, and displaying insufferable pride and arrogance, with\r\nthe chiefs of the Volscians standing round him. He bade the ambassadors\r\ndeliver their message; and after they had, in a supplicatory fashion,\r\npronounced a conciliatory oration, he answered them, dwelling with\r\nbitterness on his own unjust treatment; and then in his capacity of\r\ngeneral-in-chief of the Volscians, he bade them restore the cities and\r\nterritory which they had conquered in the late war, and to grant the\r\nfranchise to the Volscians on the same terms as enjoyed by the Latins.\r\nThese, he said, were the only conditions on which a just and lasting\r\npeace could be made. He allowed them a space of thirty days for\r\ndeliberation, and on the departure of the ambassadors immediately drew\r\noff his forces.\r\n\r\nXXXI. This affair gave an opportunity to several of the Volscians, who\r\nhad long envied and disliked his reputation, and the influence which he\r\nhad with the people. Among these was Tullus himself, who had not been\r\npersonally wronged by Marcius, but who, as it is natural he should, felt\r\nvexed at being totally eclipsed and thrown into the shade, for the\r\nVolscians now thought Marcius the greatest man in their whole nation,\r\nand considered that any one else ought to be thankful for any measure of\r\nauthority that he might think fit to bestow. Hence secret hints were\r\nexchanged, and private meetings held, in which his enemies expressed\r\ntheir dissatisfaction, calling the retreat from Rome an act of treason,\r\nnot indeed that he had betrayed any cities or armies to the enemy, but\r\nhe had granted them time, by which all other things are won and lost. He\r\nhad given the enemy a breathing time, they said, of thirty days, being\r\nno less than they required to put themselves in a posture of defence.\r\n\r\nMarcius during this time was not idle, for he attacked and defeated the\r\nallies of the Romans, and captured seven large and populous towns. The\r\nRomans did not venture to come to help their allies, but hung back from\r\ntaking the field, and seemed as if paralysed and benumbed. When the term\r\nhad expired, Marcius presented himself a second time before Rome, with\r\nhis entire army. The Romans now sent a second embassy, begging him to\r\nlay aside his anger, withdraw the Volscians from the country, and then\r\nto make such terms as would be for the advantage of both nations. The\r\nRomans, they said, would yield nothing to fear; but if he thought that\r\nspecial concessions ought to be made to the Volscians, they would be\r\nduly considered if they laid down their arms. To this Marcius answered\r\nthat, as general of the Volscians, he could give them no answer; but\r\nthat as one who was still a citizen of Rome he would advise them to\r\nadopt a humbler frame of mind, and come to him in three days with a\r\nratification of his proposals. If they should come to any other\r\ndetermination, he warned them that it would not be safe for them to come\r\nto his camp again with empty words.\r\n\r\nXXXII. When the ambassadors returned, and the Senate heard their report,\r\nthey determined in this dreadful extremity to let go their sheet anchor.\r\nThey ordered all the priests, ministers, and guardians of the sacred\r\nmysteries, and all the hereditary prophets who watched the omens given\r\nby the flight of birds, to go in procession to Marcius, dressed in their\r\nsacred vestments, and beseech him to desist from the war, and then to\r\nnegotiate conditions of peace between his countrymen and the Volscians.\r\nMarcius received the priests in his camp, but relaxed nothing of his\r\nformer harshness, bidding the Romans either accept his proposals or\r\ncontinue the war.\r\n\r\nWhen the priests returned, the Romans resolved in future to remain\r\nwithin the city, repulse any assault which might be made on the walls,\r\nand trust to time and fortune, as it was evident that they could not be\r\nsaved by anything that they could do. The city was full of confusion,\r\nexcitement, and panic terror, until there happened something like what\r\nis mentioned in Homer, but which men as a rule are unwilling to believe.\r\nHe observes that on great and important occasions\r\n\r\n    \"Athene placed a thought within his mind;\"\r\n\r\nand again--\r\n\r\n    \"But some one of th' immortals changed my mind,\r\n    And made me think of what the folk would say;\"\r\n\r\nand--\r\n\r\n    \"Because he thought it, or because the god\r\n    Commanded him to do so.\"\r\n\r\nMen despise the poet, as if, in order to carry out his absurd\r\nmythological scheme, he denied each man his liberty of will. Now Homer\r\ndoes nothing of this kind, for whatever is reasonable and likely he\r\nascribes to the exercise of our own powers, as we see in the common\r\nphrase--\r\n\r\n    \"But I reflected in my mighty soul;\"\r\n\r\nand--\r\n\r\n    \"Thus spoke he, but the son of Peleus raged,\r\n    Divided was his soul within his breast;\"\r\n\r\nand again--\r\n\r\n                 \"But she persuaded not\r\n    The wise Bellerophon, of noble mind.\"\r\n\r\nBut in strange and unlikely actions, where the actors must have been\r\nunder the influence of some supernatural impulse, he does speak of the\r\ngod not as destroying, but as directing the human will; nor does the god\r\ndirectly produce any decision, but suggests ideas which influence that\r\ndecision. Thus the act is not an involuntary one, but opportunity is\r\ngiven for a voluntary act, with confidence and good hope superadded. For\r\neither we must admit that the gods have no dealings and influence at all\r\nwith men, or else it must be in this way that they act when they assist\r\nand strengthen us, not of course by moving our hands and feet, but by\r\nfilling our minds with thoughts and ideas which either encourage us to\r\ndo what is right, or restrain us from what is wrong.\r\n\r\nXXXIII. At Rome at this time the women were praying in all the temples,\r\nespecially in that of Jupiter in the Capitol, where the noblest ladies\r\nin Rome were assembled. Among them was Valeria, the sister of the great\r\nPoplicola, who had done such great services to the State both in peace\r\nand war. Poplicola died some time before, as has been related in his\r\nLife, but his sister was held in great honour and esteem in Rome, as her\r\nlife did credit to her noble birth. She now experienced one of the\r\ndivine impulses of which I have spoken, and, inspired by Heaven to do\r\nwhat was best for her country, rose and called on the other ladies to\r\naccompany her to the house of Volumnia, the mother of Marcius. On\r\nentering, and finding her sitting with her daughter-in-law, nursing the\r\nchildren of Marcius, Valeria placed her companions in a circle round\r\nthem, and spoke as follows: \"Volumnia, and you, Virgilia, we have come\r\nto you, as women to women, without any decree of the Senate or\r\ninstructions from a magistrate; but Heaven, it would appear, has heard\r\nour prayers, and has inspired us with the idea of coming hither to beg\r\nof you to save our countrymen, and to gain for yourselves greater glory\r\nthan that of the Sabine women when they reconciled their husbands and\r\ntheir fathers. Come with us to Marcius, join us in supplicating him for\r\nmercy, and bear an honourable testimony to your country, that it never\r\nhas thought of hurting you, however terribly it has been injured by\r\nMarcius, but that it restores you to him uninjured, although possibly it\r\nwill gain no better terms by so doing.\" When Valeria had spoken thus,\r\nthe other women applauded, and Volumnia answered in the following words:\r\n\"My friends, besides those sufferings which all are now undergoing, we\r\nare especially to be pitied. We have lost the glory and goodness of our\r\nMarcius, and now see him more imprisoned in than protected by the army\r\nof the enemy. But the greatest misfortune of all is that our country\r\nshould have become so weak as to be obliged to rest its hopes of safety\r\non us. I cannot tell if he will pay any attention to us, seeing that he\r\nhas treated his native country with scorn, although he used to love it\r\nbetter than his mother, his wife, and his children. However, take us,\r\nand make what use of us you can. Lead us into his presence, and there,\r\nif we can do nothing else, we can die at his feet supplicating for\r\nRome.\"\r\n\r\nXXXIV. Having spoken thus, she took Virgilia and her children, and\r\nproceeded, in company with the other women, to the Volscian camp. Their\r\npiteous appearance produced, even in their enemies, a silent respect.\r\nMarcius himself was seated on his tribunal with the chief officers; and\r\nwhen he saw the procession of women was at first filled with amazement;\r\nbut when he recognised his mother walking first, although he tried to\r\nsupport his usual stern composure, he was overcome by his emotion. He\r\ncould not bear to receive her sitting, but descended and ran to meet\r\nher. He embraced his mother first, and longest of all; and then his wife\r\nand children, no longer restraining his tears and caresses, but\r\ncompletely carried away by his feelings.\r\n\r\nXXXV. When he had taken his fill of embraces, perceiving that his mother\r\ndesired to address him, he called the chiefs of the Volscians together,\r\nand listened to Volumnia, who addressed him as follows:\r\n\r\n\"You may judge, my son, by our dress and appearance, even though we keep\r\nsilence, to what a miserable condition your exile has reduced us at\r\nhome. Think now, how unhappy we must be, beyond all other women, when\r\nfortune has made the sight which ought to be most pleasing to us, most\r\nterrible, when I see my son, and your wife here sees her husband,\r\nbesieging his native city. Even that which consoles people under all\r\nother misfortunes, prayer to the gods, has become impossible for us. We\r\ncannot beg of heaven to give us the victory and to save you, but our\r\nprayers for you must always resemble the imprecations of our enemies\r\nagainst Rome. Your wife and children are in such a position, that they\r\nmust either lose you or lose their native country. For my own part, I\r\ncannot bear to live until fortune decides the event of this war. If I\r\ncannot now persuade you to make a lasting peace, and so become the\r\nbenefactor instead of the scourge of the two nations, be well assured\r\nthat you shall never assail Rome without first passing over the corpse\r\nof your mother. I cannot wait for that day on which I shall either see\r\nmy countrymen triumphing over my son, or my son triumphing over his\r\ncountry. If indeed I were to ask you to betray the Volscians and save\r\nyour country, this would be a hard request for you to grant; for though\r\nit is base to destroy one's own fellow citizens, it is equally wrong to\r\nbetray those who have trusted you. But we merely ask for a respite from\r\nour sufferings, which will save both nations alike from ruin, and which\r\nwill be all the more glorious for the Volscians because their\r\nsuperiority in the field has put them in a position to grant us the\r\ngreatest of blessings, peace and concord, in which they also will share\r\nalike with us. You will be chiefly to be thanked for these blessings, if\r\nwe obtain them, and chiefly to be blamed if we do not. For though the\r\nissue of war is always doubtful, this much is evident, that if you\r\nsucceed, you will become your country's evil genius, and if you fail,\r\nyou will have inflicted the greatest miseries on men who are your\r\nfriends and benefactors, merely in order to gratify your own private\r\nspite.\"\r\n\r\nXXXVI. While Volumnia spoke thus, Marcius listened to her in silence.\r\nAfter she had ceased, he stood for a long while without speaking, until\r\nshe again addressed him. \"Why art thou silent, my son? Is it honourable\r\nto make everything give way to your rancorous hatred, and is it a\r\ndisgrace to yield to your mother, when she pleads for such important\r\nmatters? Does it become a great man to remember that he has been ill\r\ntreated, and does it not rather become him to recollect the debt which\r\nchildren owe to their parents. And yet no one ought to be more grateful\r\nthan you yourself, who punish ingratitude so bitterly: in spite of\r\nwhich, though you have already taken a deep revenge on your country for\r\nits ill treatment of you, you have not made your mother any return for\r\nher kindness. It would have been right for me to gain my point without\r\nany pressure, when pleading in such a just and honourable cause; but if\r\nI cannot prevail by words, this resource alone is left me.\" Saying this,\r\nshe fell at his feet, together with his wife and children. Marcius,\r\ncrying out, \"What have you done to me, mother?\" raised her from the\r\nground, and pressing her hand violently, exclaimed, \"You have conquered;\r\nyour victory is a blessed one for Rome, but ruinous to me, for I shall\r\nretreat conquered by you alone.\" After speaking thus, and conferring for\r\na short time in private with his mother and his wife, he at their own\r\nrequest sent them back to Rome, and the following night led away the\r\nVolscian army. Various opinions were current among the Volscians about\r\nwhat had taken place. Some blamed him severely, while others approved,\r\nbecause they wished for peace. Others again, though they disliked what\r\nhe had done, yet did not regard him as a traitor, but as a soft-hearted\r\nman who had yielded to overwhelming pressure. However, no one disobeyed\r\nhim, but all followed him in his retreat, though more out of regard for\r\nhis noble character than for his authority.\r\n\r\nXXXVII. The Roman people, when the war was at an end, showed even more\r\nplainly than before what terror and despair they had been in. As soon as\r\nthey saw the Volscians retreating from their walls, all the temples were\r\nopened, and filled with worshippers crowned with garlands and\r\nsacrificing as if for a victory. The joy of the senate and people was\r\nmost conspicuously shown in their gratitude to the women, whom they\r\nspoke of as having beyond all doubt saved Rome. The senate decreed that\r\nthe magistrates should grant to the women any mark of respect and esteem\r\nwhich they themselves might choose. The women decided on the building of\r\nthe temple of Female Fortune, the expenses of which they themselves\r\noffered to subscribe, only asking the state to undertake the maintenance\r\nof the services in it. The senate praised their public spirit, but\r\nordered the temple and shrine to be built at the public expense.\r\nNevertheless, the women with their own money provided a second image of\r\nthe goddess, which the Romans say, when it was placed in the temple was\r\nheard to say,\r\n\r\n     \"A pleasing gift have women placed me here.\"\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. The legend says that this voice was twice heard, which seems\r\nimpossible and hard for us to believe. It is not impossible for statues\r\nto sweat, to shed tears, or to be covered with spots of blood, because\r\nwood and stone often when mouldering or decaying, collect moisture\r\nwithin them, and not only send it forth with many colours derived from\r\ntheir own substance, but also receive other colours from the air; and\r\nthere is nothing that forbids us to believe that by such appearances as\r\nthese heaven may foreshadow the future. It is also possible that statues\r\nshould make sounds like moaning or sighing, by the tearing asunder of\r\nthe particles of which they are composed; but that articulate human\r\nspeech should come from inanimate things is altogether impossible, for\r\nneither the human soul, nor even a god can utter words without a body\r\nfitted with the organs of speech. Whenever therefore we find many\r\ncredible witnesses who force us to believe something of this kind, we\r\nmust suppose that the imagination was influenced by some sensation which\r\nappeared to resemble a real one, just as in dreams we seem to hear when\r\nwe hear not, and to see when we see not. Those persons, however, who are\r\nfull of religious fervour and love of the gods, and who refuse to\r\ndisbelieve or reject anything of this kind, find in its miraculous\r\ncharacter, and in the fact that the ways of God are not as our ways, a\r\ngreat support to their faith. For He resembles mankind in nothing,\r\nneither in nature, nor movement, nor learning, nor power, and so it is\r\nnot to be wondered at if He does what seems to us impossible. Nay,\r\nthough He differs from us in every respect, it is in his works that He\r\nis most unlike us. But, as Herakleitus says, our knowledge of things\r\ndivine mostly fails for want of faith.\r\n\r\nXXXIX. When Marcius returned to Antium, Tullus, who had long hated him\r\nand envied his superiority, determined to put him to death, thinking\r\nthat if he let slip the present opportunity he should not obtain\r\nanother. Having suborned many to bear witness against him, he called\r\nupon him publicly to render an account to the Volscians of what he had\r\ndone as their general. Marcius, fearing to be reduced to a private\r\nstation while his enemy Tullus, who had great influence with his\r\ncountrymen, was general, answered that he had been given his office of\r\ncommander-in-chief by the Volscian nation, and to them alone would he\r\nsurrender it, but that as to an account of what he had done, he was\r\nready at that moment, if they chose, to render it to the people of\r\nAntium. Accordingly the people assembled, and the popular orators\r\nendeavoured by their speeches to excite the lower classes against\r\nMarcius. When, however, he rose to speak, the mob were awed to silence,\r\nwhile the nobility, and those who had gained by the peace, made no\r\nsecret of their good will towards him, and of their intention to vote in\r\nhis favour. Under these circumstances, Tullus was unwilling to let him\r\nspeak, for he was a brilliant orator, and his former services far\r\noutweighed his last offence. Indeed, the whole indictment was a proof of\r\nhow much they owed him, for they never could have thought themselves\r\nwronged by not taking Rome, if Marcius had not brought them so near to\r\ntaking it. Tullus, therefore, thought that it would not do to wait, or\r\nto trust to the mob, but he and the boldest of his accomplices, crying\r\nout that the Volscians could not listen to the traitor, nor endure him\r\nto play the despot over them by not laying down his command, rushed upon\r\nhim in a body and killed him, without any of the bystanders interfering\r\nin his behalf. However, the most part of the nation was displeased at\r\nthis act, as was soon proved by the numbers who came from every city to\r\nsee his dead body, by the splendid funeral with which he was honoured,\r\nand by the arms and trophies which were hung over his tomb, as that of a\r\nbrave man and a consummate general.\r\n\r\nThe Romans, when they heard of his death, made no sign of either honour\r\nor anger towards him, except that they gave permission to the women, at\r\ntheir request, to wear mourning for him for ten months, as if they were\r\neach mourning for her father, her brother, or her son. This was the\r\nextreme limit of the period of mourning, which was fixed by Numa\r\nPompilius, as has been related in his Life.\r\n\r\nThe loss of Marcius was at once felt by the Volscians. First of all,\r\nthey quarrelled with the Aequi, their friends and allies, and even came\r\nto blows with them; next, they were defeated by the Romans in a battle\r\nin which Tullus was slain, and the flower of the Volscian army perished.\r\nAfter this disaster they were glad to surrender at discretion, and\r\nbecome the subjects of Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF ALKIBIADES AND CORIOLANUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. As all the most memorable achievements of both Alkibiades and\r\nCoriolanus are now before us, we may begin our comparison by observing\r\nthat as to military exploits, the balance is nearly even; for both alike\r\ngave proofs of great personal bravery and great skill in generalship,\r\nunless it be thought that Alkibiades proved himself the more perfect\r\ngeneral because of his many victories both by sea and land. Both alike\r\nobtained great success for their native countries while they remained in\r\ncommand of their countrymen, and both succeeded even more remarkably\r\nwhen fighting against them. As to their respective policy, that of\r\nAlkibiades was disliked by the more respectable citizens, because of his\r\npersonal arrogance, and the arts to which he stooped to gain the favour\r\nof the lower classes; while the proud ungracious haughtiness of\r\nCoriolanus caused him to be hated by the people of Rome. In this respect\r\nneither of them can be praised; yet he who tries to gain the favour of\r\nthe people is less to blame than he who insults them for fear he should\r\nbe thought to court them. Although it is wrong to flatter the people in\r\norder to gain power, yet to owe one's power only to terror, and to ill\r\ntreat and keep down the masses is disgraceful as well as wrong.\r\n\r\nII. It is not difficult to see why Marcius is considered to have been a\r\nsimple-minded and straightforward character, while Alkibiades has the\r\nreputation of a false and tricky politician. The latter has been\r\nespecially blamed for the manner in which he deceived and outwitted the\r\nLacedaemonian ambassadors, by which, as we learn from Thucydides, he\r\nbrought the truce between the two nations to an end. Yet that stroke of\r\npolicy, though it again involved Athens in war, rendered her strong and\r\nformidable, through the alliance with Argos and Mantinea, which she owed\r\nto Alkibiades. Marcius also, we are told by Dionysius, produced a\r\nquarrel between the Romans and the Volscians by bringing a false\r\naccusation against those Volscians who came to see the festival at Rome;\r\nand in this case the wickedness of his object increased his guilt,\r\nbecause he did not act from a desire of personal aggrandisement, or from\r\npolitical rivalry, as did Alkibiades, but merely yielding to what Dion\r\ncalls the unprofitable passion of anger, he threw a large part of Italy\r\ninto confusion, and in his rage against his native country destroyed\r\nmany innocent cities. On the other hand, the anger of Alkibiades caused\r\ngreat misfortune to his countrymen; yet as soon as he found that they\r\nhad relented towards him he returned cheerfully to his allegiance, and\r\nafter being banished for the second time, did not take any delight in\r\nseeing their generals defeated, and could not sit still and let them\r\nmake mistakes and uselessly expose themselves to danger. He did just\r\nwhat Aristeides is so much praised for doing to Themistokles; he went to\r\nthe generals, although they were not his friends, and pointed out to\r\nthem what ought to be done.\r\n\r\nMarcius, again, is to be blamed for having made the whole of Rome suffer\r\nfor what only a part of it had done, while the best and most important\r\nclass of citizens had been wronged equally with himself, and warmly\r\nsympathised with him. Afterwards, although his countrymen sent him many\r\nembassies, beseeching his forgiveness for their one act of ignorance and\r\npassion, he would not listen to them, but showed that it was with the\r\nintention of utterly destroying Rome, not of obtaining his own\r\nrestoration to it, that he had begun that terrible and savage war\r\nagainst it. This, then, may be noted as the difference between their\r\nrespective positions: Alkibiades went back to the Athenian side when the\r\nSpartans began to plot against him, because he both feared them and\r\nhated them; but Marcius, who was in every respect well treated by the\r\nVolscians, could not honourably desert their cause. He had been elected\r\ntheir commander-in-chief, and besides this great power enjoyed their\r\nentire confidence; while Alkibiades, though his assistance was found\r\nuseful by the Lacedaemonians, was never trusted by them, but remained\r\nwithout any recognised position, first in Sparta and then in the camp in\r\nAsia Minor, till he finally threw himself into the arms of Tissaphernes,\r\nunless, indeed, he took this step to save Athens, hoping some day to be\r\nrestored to her.\r\n\r\nIII. As to money, Alkibiades has been blamed for receiving it\r\ndiscreditably in bribes, and for spending it in luxurious extravagance;\r\nwhile the generals who offered Marcius money as an honourable reward for\r\nhis valour could not prevail upon him to accept it. This, however, made\r\nhim especially unpopular in the debates about freeing the people from\r\ndebt, because it was said that he pressed so hardly on the poor, not\r\nbecause he wished to make money by them, but purely through arrogance\r\nand pride. Antipater, in a letter to a friend on the death of Aristotle\r\nthe philosopher, observes, \"Besides his other abilities, the man had the\r\nart of persuasion.\" Now Marcius had not this art; and its absence made\r\nall his exploits and all his virtues unpleasant even to those who\r\nbenefited by them, as they could not endure his pride and haughtiness,\r\nwhich brooked no compeer. Alkibiades, on the other hand, knew how to\r\ndeal on friendly terms with every one, and we need not therefore be\r\nsurprised at the pleasure which men took in his successes, while even\r\nsome of his failures had a charm of their own for his friends. Hence it\r\nwas that Alkibiades, even after inflicting many grievous losses upon his\r\ncountrymen, was chosen by them as commander-in-chief, whereas Marcius,\r\nwhen after a splendid display of courage and conduct he tried for the\r\nconsulship which he deserved, failed to obtain it. The one could not be\r\nhated by his countrymen, even when they were ill treated by him; while\r\nthe other, though admired by all, was loved by none.\r\n\r\nIV. Marcius, indeed, effected nothing great when in command of his own\r\ncountrymen, but only when fighting against them, whereas the Athenians\r\nfrequently benefited by the successes of Alkibiades, when he was acting\r\nas their commander-in-chief. Alkibiades when present easily triumphed\r\nover his enemies, whereas Marcius, although present, was condemned by\r\nthe Romans, and put to death by the Volscians. Moreover, though he was\r\nwrongfully slain, yet he himself furnished his enemies with a pretext\r\nfor his murder, by refusing the public offer of peace made by the\r\nRomans, and then yielding to the private entreaties of his mother and\r\nwife, so that he did not put an end to the enmity between the two\r\nnations, but left them at war, and yet lost a favourable opportunity for\r\nthe Volscians.\r\n\r\nIf he was influenced by a feeling of duty towards the Volscians, he\r\nought to have obtained their consent before withdrawing their forces\r\nfrom before Rome; but if he cared nothing for them, or for anything\r\nexcept the gratification of his own passion, and with this feeling made\r\nwar upon his country, and only paused in the moment of victory, it was\r\nnot creditable to him to spare his country for his mother's sake, but\r\nrather he should have spared his country and his mother with it; for his\r\nmother and his wife were but a part of Rome, which he was besieging.\r\nThat he should have treated the public supplications of ambassadors and\r\nthe prayers of priests with contempt, and afterwards have drawn off his\r\nforces to please his mother, is not so much a credit to her as a\r\ndisgrace to his country, which was saved by the tears and entreaties of\r\none woman, as though it did not deserve to survive on its own merits.\r\nThe mercy which he showed the Romans was so harshly and offensively\r\ngranted that it pleased neither party; he withdrew his forces without\r\nhaving either having come to an understanding with his friends or his\r\nfoes. All this must be attributed to his haughty, unbending temper,\r\nwhich is in all cases odious, but which in an ambitious man renders him\r\nsavage and inexorable. Such men will not seek for popularity, thinking\r\nthemselves already sufficiently distinguished, and then are angry at\r\nfinding themselves unpopular.\r\n\r\nIndeed, neither Metellus, nor Aristeides, nor Epameinondas would stoop\r\nto court the favour of the people, and had a thorough contempt for all\r\nthat the people can either give or take away; yet although they were\r\noften ostracised, convicted, and condemned to pay fines, they were not\r\nangry with their fellow countrymen for their folly, but came back and\r\nbecame reconciled to them as soon as they repented. The man who will not\r\ncourt the people, ought least of all to bear malice against them,\r\nreflecting that anger at not being elected to an office in the state,\r\nmust spring from an excessive desire to obtain it.\r\n\r\nV. Alkibiades made no secret of his delight in being honoured and his\r\nvexation when slighted, and in consequence endeavoured to make himself\r\nacceptable to all with whom he had to do. Marcius was prevented by his\r\npride from courting those who could have bestowed honour and advancement\r\nupon him, while his ambition tortured him if these were withheld.\r\n\r\nThese are the points which we find to blame in his character, which in\r\nall other respects was a noble one. With regard to temperance, and\r\ncontempt for money, he may be compared with the greatest and purest men\r\nof Greece, not merely with Alkibiades, who cared only too little for\r\nsuch things, and paid no regard to his reputation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF TIMOLEON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was for the sake of others that I first undertook to write\r\nbiographies, but I soon began to dwell upon and delight in them for\r\nmyself, endeavouring to the best of my ability to regulate my own life,\r\nand to make it like that of those who were reflected in their history as\r\nit were in a mirror before me. By the study of their biographies, we\r\nreceive each man as a guest into our minds, and we seem to understand\r\ntheir character as the result of a personal acquaintance, because we\r\nhave obtained from their acts the best and most important means of\r\nforming an opinion about them. \"What greater pleasure could'st thou gain\r\nthan this?\" What more valuable for the elevation of our own character?\r\nDemokritus says, that we ought to pray that we may meet with propitious\r\nphantasms, and that from the infinite space which surrounds us good and\r\ncongenial phantasms, rather than base and sinister ones, may be brought\r\ninto contact with us. He degrades philosophy by foisting into it a\r\ntheory which is untrue, and which leads to unbounded superstition;\r\nwhereas we, by our familiarity with history, and habit of writing it, so\r\ntrain ourselves by constantly receiving into our minds the memorials of\r\nthe great and good, that should anything base or vicious be placed in\r\nour way by the society into which we are necessarily thrown, we reject\r\nit and expel it from our thoughts, by fixing them calmly and severely on\r\nsome of these great examples. Of these, I have chosen for you in this\r\npresent instance, the life of Timoleon the Corinthian, and that of\r\nAemilius Paulus, men who both laid their plans with skill, and carried\r\nthem out with good fortune, so as to raise a question whether it was\r\nmore by good luck or by good sense that they succeeded in their most\r\nimportant achievements.\r\n\r\nI. The state of affairs at Syracuse, before the mission of Timoleon to\r\nSicily, was this. Dion had driven out the despot[A] Dionysius, but was\r\nimmediately afterwards slain by treachery, and those who, under Dion,\r\nhad freed the Syracusans, quarrelled amongst themselves. The city, which\r\nreceived a constant succession of despots, was almost forsaken because\r\nof its many troubles. Of the rest of Sicily, one part was rendered quite\r\nruined and uninhabited by the wars, and most of the cities were held by\r\nbarbarians of various nations, and soldiers who were under no paymaster.\r\nAs these men willingly lent their aid to effect changes of dynasty,\r\nDionysius, in the twelfth year of his exile, collected a body of foreign\r\ntroops, drove out Nysaeus, the then ruler of Syracuse, again restored\r\nhis empire, and was re-established as despot. He had strangely lost the\r\ngreatest known empire at the hands of a few men, and more strangely\r\nstill became again the lord of those who had driven him out, after\r\nhaving been an exile and a beggar. Those then of the Syracusans who\r\nremained in the city were the subjects of a despot not naturally humane,\r\nand whose heart now had been embittered by misfortune:[B] but the better\r\nclass of citizens and the men of note fled to Hiketes, the ruler of\r\nLeontini, swore allegiance to him, and chose him as their general for\r\nthe war. This man was nowise better than the avowed despots, but they\r\nhad no other resource, and they trusted him because he was a Syracusan\r\nby birth, and had a force capable of encountering that of their own\r\ndespot.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: [Greek: tyrannos], here and elsewhere translated _despot_,\r\nmeans a man who had obtained irresponsible power by unconstitutional\r\nmeans.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: Compare Tacitus, \"eo immitior quia toleraverat.\"]\r\n\r\nII. Meanwhile the Carthaginians came to Sicily with a great fleet, and\r\nwere hovering off the island watching their opportunity. The Sicilians\r\nin terror wished to send an embassy to Greece, and ask for help from the\r\nCorinthians, not merely on account of their kinship with them, and of\r\nthe many kindnesses which they had received from them, but also because\r\nthey saw that the whole city loved freedom, and hated despots, and that\r\nit had waged its greatest and most important wars, not for supremacy and\r\ngreed of power, but on behalf of the liberty of Greece. But Hiketes who\r\nhad obtained his post of commander-in-chief with a view, not to the\r\nliberation of Syracuse, but the establishment of himself as despot\r\nthere, had already had secret negotiations with the Carthaginians,\r\nthough in public he commended the Syracusans, and sent ambassadors of\r\nhis own with the rest to Peloponnesus: not that he wished that any\r\nassistance should come thence, but, in case the Corinthians, as was\r\nprobable, should refuse their help because of the disturbed state of\r\nGreece, he hoped that he should more easily be able to bring matters\r\nround to suit the Carthaginian interest, and to use them as allies\r\neither against the Syracusan citizens, or against their despot. Of this\r\ntreacherous design he was shortly afterwards convicted.\r\n\r\nIII. When the ambassadors arrived, the Corinthians, who had always been\r\nin the habit of watching over the interests of their colonies,\r\nespecially Syracuse, and who were not at war with any of the Greek\r\nStates at that time, but living in peace and leisure, eagerly voted to\r\nhelp them. A General was now sought for, and while the government was\r\nnominating and proposing those who were eager for an opportunity of\r\ndistinguishing themselves, a man of the people stood up and named\r\nTimoleon, the son of Timodemus, one who no longer took any part in\r\npolitics, and who had no hope or thought of obtaining the post: but some\r\ngod, it seems, put it into the man's mind to name him, such a kind\r\nfortune was at once shown at his election, and such success attended his\r\nactions, illustrating his noble character. He was of a good family, both\r\nhis father Timodemus, and his mother Demariste being of rank in the\r\ncity. He was a lover of his country, and of a mild temper, except only\r\nthat he had a violent hatred for despotism and all that is base. His\r\nnature was so happily constituted, that in his campaigns he showed much\r\njudgment when young, and no less daring when old. He had an elder\r\nbrother, Timophanes, who was in no respect like him, but rash, and\r\ninflamed with a passion for monarchy by worthless friends and foreign\r\nsoldiers, with whom he spent all his time: he was reckless in a\r\ncampaign, and loved danger for its own sake, and by this he won the\r\nhearts of his fellow-citizens, and was given commands, as being a man of\r\ncourage and of action. Timoleon assisted him in obtaining these\r\ncommands, by concealing his faults or making them appear small, and by\r\nmagnifying the clever things which he did.\r\n\r\nIV. Now in the battle which the Corinthians fought against the Argives\r\nand Kleoneans, Timoleon was ranked among the hoplites,[A] and his\r\nbrother Timophanes, who was in command of the cavalry, fell into great\r\ndanger. His horse received a wound, and threw him off among the enemy.\r\nOf his companions, some at once dispersed in panic, while those who\r\nremained by him, being a few against many, with difficulty held their\r\nown. When Timoleon saw what had happened, he ran to the rescue, and held\r\nhis shield in front of Timophanes as he lay, and, after receiving many\r\nblows, both from missiles and in hand-to-hand fight, on his arms and\r\nbody, with difficulty drove back the enemy and saved his brother.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Heavy armed foot-soldiers, carrying a spear and shield.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Corinthians, fearing lest they might again suffer what they did\r\nonce before when their own allies took their city, decreed that they\r\nwould keep four hundred mercenary soldiers, they made Timophanes their\r\ncommander.\r\n\r\nBut he, disdaining truth and honour, immediately took measures to get\r\nthe city into his own power, and showed his tyrannical disposition by\r\nputting to death many of the leading citizens without a trial. Timoleon\r\nwas grieved at this, and, treating the other's crime as his own\r\nmisfortune, endeavoured to argue with him, and begged him to abandon his\r\nfoolish and wicked design, and to seek for some means of making amends\r\nto his fellow-citizens. However, as he rejected his brother's advice,\r\nand treated him with contempt, Timoleon took Aeschylus, his kinsman,\r\nbrother of the wife of Timophanes, and his friend the seer, whom\r\nTheopompus calls Satyrus, but Ephorus and Timaeus call Orthagoras, and,\r\nafter an interval of a few days, again went to his brother. The three\r\nmen now stood round him, and besought him even now to listen to reason,\r\nand repent of his ambition; but as Timophanes at first laughed at them,\r\nand then became angry and indignant, Timoleon stepped a little aside,\r\nand covering his face, stood weeping, while the other two drew their\r\nswords and quickly despatched him.\r\n\r\nV. When this deed was noised abroad, the more generous of the\r\nCorinthians praised Timoleon for his abhorrence of wickedness and his\r\ngreatness of soul, because, though of a kindly disposition, and fond of\r\nhis own family, he had nevertheless preferred his country to his family,\r\nand truth and justice to his own advantage. He had distinguished himself\r\nin his country's cause both by saving his brother's life, and by putting\r\nhim to death when he plotted to reduce her to slavery. However, those\r\nwho could not endure to live in a democracy, and who were accustomed to\r\nlook up to those in power, pretended to rejoice in the death of the\r\ntyrant, but by their abuse of Timoleon for having done an unholy and\r\nimpious deed, reduced him to a state of great melancholy. Hearing that\r\nhis mother took it greatly to heart, and that she used harsh words and\r\ninvoked terrible curses upon him, he went to her to try to bring her to\r\nanother state of mind, but she would not endure the sight of him, but\r\nshut the door against him. Then indeed he became very dejected, and\r\ndisordered in his mind, so as to form an intention of destroying himself\r\nby starvation; but this his friends would not permit, but prevailed on\r\nhim by force and entreaty so that he determined to live, but alone by\r\nhimself. He gave up all interest in public affairs, and at first did not\r\neven enter the city, but passed his time wandering in the wildest part\r\nof the country in an agony of mind.\r\n\r\nVI. Thus our judgments, if they do not borrow from reason and philosophy\r\na fixity and steadiness of purpose in their acts, are easily swayed and\r\ninfluenced by the praise or blame of others, which make us distrust our\r\nown opinions.\r\n\r\nFor not only, it seems, must the deed itself be noble and just, but also\r\nthe principle from which we do it must be stable and unchangeable, so\r\nthat we may make up our minds and then act from conviction. If we do\r\nnot, then like those epicures who most eagerly seize upon the daintiest\r\nfood and soonest become satiated and nauseate it, so we become filled\r\nwith sorrow and remorse when the deed is done, because the splendid\r\nideas of virtue and honour which led us to do it fade away in our minds\r\non account of our own moral weakness. A remorseful change of mind\r\nrenders even a noble action base, whereas the determination which is\r\ngrounded on knowledge and reason cannot change even if its actions fail.\r\nWherefore Phokion the Athenian, who opposed the measures of Leosthenes,\r\nwhen Leosthenes seemed to have succeeded, and he saw the Athenians\r\nsacrificing and priding themselves on their victory, said that he should\r\nhave wished that he had himself done what had been done, but he should\r\nwish to have given the same counsel that he did give. Aristeides the\r\nLokrian, one of the companions of Plato, put this even more strongly\r\nwhen Dionysius the elder asked for one of his daughters in marriage. \"I\r\nhad rather,\" he said, \"see the girl a corpse, than the consort of a\r\ndespot.\" A short time afterwards when Dionysius put his sons to death\r\nand insultingly asked him whether he were still of the same mind about\r\nthe disposal of his daughter, he answered, that he was grieved at what\r\nhad happened, but had not changed his mind about what he had said. And\r\nthese words perhaps show a greater and more perfect virtue than\r\nPhokion's.\r\n\r\nVII. Now Timoleon's misery, after the deed was done, whether it was\r\ncaused by pity for the dead or filial reverence for his mother, so broke\r\ndown and humbled his spirit that for nearly twenty years he took no part\r\nin any important public affair. So when he was nominated as General, and\r\nwhen the people gladly received his name and elected him, Telekleides,\r\nwho at that time was the first man in the city for power and reputation,\r\nstood up and spoke encouragingly to Timoleon, bidding him prove himself\r\nbrave and noble in the campaign.[A] \"If,\" said he, \"you fight well, we\r\nshall think that we slew a tyrant, but if badly, that we murdered your\r\nbrother.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: From these words, Grote conjectures that Telekleides was\r\nalso present at the death of Timophanes.]\r\n\r\nWhile Timoleon was preparing for his voyage and collecting his soldiers,\r\nletters were brought to the Corinthians from Hiketes plainly showing\r\nthat he had changed sides and betrayed them.\r\n\r\nFor as soon as he had sent off his ambassadors to Corinth, he openly\r\njoined the Carthaginians, and in concert with them attempted to drive\r\nout Dionysius and establish himself as despot of Syracuse.\r\n\r\nFearing that the opportunity would escape him if an army and general\r\ncame from Corinth before he had succeeded, he sent a letter to the\r\nCorinthians to say that they need not incur the trouble and expense of\r\nsending an expedition to Sicily and risking their lives, especially as\r\nthe Carthaginians would dispute their passage, and were now watching for\r\ntheir expedition with a numerous fleet; and that, as they had been so\r\nslow, he should be obliged to make these Carthaginians his allies to\r\nattack the despot.\r\n\r\nWhen these letters were read, even if any of the Corinthians had been\r\nlukewarm about the expedition, now their anger against Hiketes stirred\r\nthem up to co-operate vigorously with Timoleon and assist him in\r\nequipping his force.\r\n\r\nVIII. When the ships were ready, and everything had been provided for\r\nthe soldiers, the priestesses of Proserpine had a dream that the two\r\ngoddesses appeared dressed for a journey, and said that they were going\r\nto accompany Timoleon on his voyage to Sicily.\r\n\r\nHereupon the Corinthians equipped a sacred trireme, and named it after\r\nthe two goddesses. Timoleon himself proceeded to Delphi and sacrificed\r\nto the god, and when he came into the place where oracles were\r\ndelivered, a portent occurred to him. From among the various offerings\r\nsuspended there, a victor's wreath, embroidered with crowns and symbols\r\nof victory slipped down and was carried by the air so as to alight upon\r\nthe head of Timoleon; so that it appeared that the god sent him forth to\r\nhis campaign already crowned with success. He started with only seven\r\nships from Corinth, two from Korkyra, and one from Leukadia; and as he\r\nput to sea at night and was sailing with a fair wind, he suddenly saw\r\nthe heavens open above his ship and pour down a flood of brilliant\r\nlight. After this a torch like that used at the mysteries rose up before\r\nthem, and, proceeding on the same course, alighted on that part of Italy\r\nfor which the pilots were steering. The seers explained that this\r\nappearance corroborated the dream of the priestesses, and that the light\r\nfrom heaven showed that the two goddesses were joining the expedition;\r\nfor Sicily is sacred to Proserpine, as the myth tells us that she was\r\ncarried off there, and that the island itself was given her as a wedding\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe fleet, encouraged by these proofs of divine favour, crossed the open\r\nsea, and proceeded along the Italian coast. But the news from Sicily\r\ngave Timoleon much concern, and dispirited his soldiers. For Hiketes had\r\nconquered Dionysius, and taken the greater part of Syracuse; he had\r\ndriven him into the citadel and what is called the island, and was\r\nbesieging and blockading him there, and urging the Carthaginians to take\r\nmeasures to prevent Timoleon from landing in Sicily, in order that, when\r\nthe Greeks were driven off, he and his new allies might partition the\r\nisland between themselves.\r\n\r\nIX. The Carthaginians sent twenty triremes to Rhegium, having on board\r\nambassadors from Hiketes to Timoleon charged with instructions as bad as\r\nhis deeds. For their proposals were plausible, though their plan was\r\nbase, being that Timoleon, if he chose, should come as an adviser to\r\nHiketes and partake of his conquests; but that he should send his ships\r\nand soldiers back to Corinth, as the war was within a little of being\r\nfinished, and as the Carthaginians were determined to oppose his passage\r\nby force if he attempted it. So the Corinthians, when they reached\r\nRhegium, found these ambassadors, and saw the Carthaginian fleet\r\ncruising to intercept them. They were enraged at this treatment, and all\r\nwere filled with anger against Hiketes, and with fear for the people of\r\nSicily, who, they clearly saw, were to be the prize of the treachery of\r\nHiketes and the ambition of the Carthaginians. Yet it seemed impossible\r\nthat they should overcome both the fleet of the barbarians which was\r\nriding there, double their own in number, and also the forces under\r\nHiketes at Syracuse, of which they had expected to be put in command.\r\n\r\nX. Nevertheless Timoleon met the ambassadors and the Carthaginian\r\nadmirals, and mildly informed them that \"he would accede to their\r\nproposals, for what could he do if he refused them? but that he wished,\r\nbefore they parted, to listen to them, and to answer them publicly\r\nbefore the people of Rhegium, a city of Greek origin and friendly to\r\nboth parties; as this would conduce to his own safety, and they also\r\nwould be the more bound to stand by their proposal about the Syracusans\r\nif they took the people of Rhegium as their witnesses.\" He made this\r\noverture to help a plot which he had of stealing a march upon them, and\r\nthe leading men of the Rhegines assisted him in it, as they wished the\r\nCorinthian influence to prevail in Sicily, and feared to have the\r\nbarbarians for neighbours. Accordingly they called together an assembly\r\nand shut the city gates, that the citizens might not attend to anything\r\nelse, and then, coming forward, they made speeches of great length, one\r\nman treating the subject after another without coming to any conclusion,\r\nbut merely wasting the time, until the Corinthian triremes had put to\r\nsea. The Carthaginians were kept at the assembly without suspecting\r\nanything, because Timoleon himself was present and gave them to\r\nunderstand that he was just upon the point of rising and making them a\r\nspeech. But when news was secretly conveyed to him that the fleet was\r\nunder way, and that his ship alone was left behind waiting for him, he\r\nslipped through the crowd, the Rhegines who stood round the bema[A]\r\nhelping to conceal him, and, gaining the seashore, sailed off with all\r\nhaste.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Bema, the tribune from which the orators spoke.]\r\n\r\nThey reached Tauromenium in Sicily, where they were hospitably received\r\nby Andromachus, the ruler and lord of that city, who had long before\r\ninvited them thither. This Andromachus was the father of Timaeus, the\r\nhistorian, and being as he was by far the most powerful of the\r\nlegitimate princes of Sicily, ruled his subjects according to law and\r\njustice, and never concealed his dislike and hatred of the despots. For\r\nthis reason he permitted Timoleon to make his city his headquarters, and\r\nprevailed on the citizens to cast in their lot with the Syracusans and\r\nfree their native land.\r\n\r\nXI. At Rhegium meanwhile, the Carthaginians, when the assembly broke up\r\nand Timoleon was gone, were infuriated at being outwitted, and became a\r\nstanding joke to the people of Rhegium, because they, although they were\r\nPhoenicians, yet did not seem to enjoy a piece of deceit when it was at\r\ntheir own expense. They then sent an ambassador in a trireme to\r\nTauromenium, who made a long speech to Andromachus, threatening him in a\r\nbombastic and barbarian style with their vengeance if he did not at once\r\nturn the Corinthians out of his city. At last he pointed to his\r\noutstretched hand, and turning it over threatened that he would so deal\r\nwith the city. Andromachus laughed, and made no other answer than to\r\nhold out his own hand in the same way, now with one side up, and now\r\nwith the other, and bade him sail away unless he wished to have his ship\r\nso dealt with.\r\n\r\nHiketes, when he heard of Timoleon's arrival, in his terror sent for\r\nmany of the Carthaginian ships of war; and now the Syracusans began\r\nutterly to despair of their safety, seeing the Carthaginians in\r\npossession of the harbour, Hiketes holding the city, and Dionysius still\r\nmaster of the promontory, while Timoleon was as it were hanging on the\r\noutskirts of Sicily in that little fortress of Tauromenium, with but\r\nlittle hope and a weak force, for he had no more than one thousand\r\nsoldiers and the necessary supplies for them. Nor had the cities of\r\nSicily any trust in him, as they were in great distress, and greatly\r\nexasperated against those who pretended to lead armies to their succour,\r\non account of the treachery of Kallippus and Pharax; who, one an\r\nAthenian and the other a Lacedaemonian, but both giving out that they\r\nwere come to fight for freedom and to put down despotism, did so\r\ntyrannise themselves, that the reign of the despots in Sicily seemed to\r\nhave been a golden age, and those who died in slavery were thought more\r\nhappy than those who lived to see liberty.\r\n\r\nXII. So thinking that the Corinthian would be no better than these men,\r\nand that the same plausible and specious baits would be held out to lure\r\nthem with hopes and pleasant promises under the yoke of a new master,\r\nthey all viewed the proposals of the Corinthians with suspicion and\r\nshrank back from them except the Adranites. These were the inhabitants\r\nof a small city, sacred to Adranus, a god whose worship extends\r\nespecially throughout Sicily. They were at feud with one another, as one\r\nparty invited Hiketes and the Carthaginians, while the other sent for\r\nTimoleon to help them. And by some chance it happened that as each party\r\nstrove to get there first, they both arrived at the same time; Hiketes\r\nwith five thousand soldiers, whereas Timoleon altogether had no more\r\nthan twelve hundred.\r\n\r\nStarting with these men from Tauromenium, which is forty-two miles from\r\nAdranum, he made but a short march on the first day, and then encamped.\r\nOn the next day he marched steadily forward, passed some difficult\r\ncountry, and late in the day heard that Hiketas had just reached the\r\nlittle fortress and was encamping before it. On this the officers halted\r\nthe van of the army, thinking that the men would be fresher after taking\r\nfood and rest; but Timoleon went to them and begged them not to do so,\r\nbut to lead them on as fast as they could, and fall upon the enemy while\r\nthey were in disorder, as it was probable they would be, having just\r\ncome off their march, and being busy about pitching their tents, and\r\ncooking their supper. Saying this he seized his shield,[A] and led the\r\nway himself as to an assured victory; and the rest, reassured, followed\r\nhim confidently. They were distant only about thirty furlongs. These\r\nwere soon passed, and they fell headlong upon the enemy, who were in\r\nconfusion, and fled as soon as they discovered their attack. For this\r\nreason no more than three hundred of them were slain, but twice as many\r\nwere taken prisoners, and their camp was captured. The people of Adranum\r\nnow opened their gates, and made their submission to Timoleon, relating\r\nwith awe and wonder how, at the outset of the battle, the sacred doors\r\nof the temple flew open of their own accord, and the spear of the god\r\nwas seen to quiver at the point, while his face was covered with a thick\r\nsweat.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The shield of a General was habitually carried for him by\r\nan orderly.]\r\n\r\nXIII. These portents, it seems, did not merely presage the victory, but\r\nalso the subsequent events, of which this was the prosperous beginning.\r\nImmediately several cities sent ambassadors and joined Timoleon, as did\r\nalso Mamercus the despot of Katana, a man of warlike tastes and great\r\nwealth, who made an alliance with him. But the most important thing of\r\nall was that Dionysius himself, who had now lost all hope of success,\r\nand was on the point of being starved out, despising Hiketes for being\r\nso shamefully beaten, but admiring Timoleon, sent to him and offered to\r\ndeliver up both himself and the citadel to the Corinthians.\r\n\r\nTimoleon, accepting this unexpected piece of good fortune, sent\r\nEukleides and Telemachus, Corinthian officers, into the citadel, and\r\nfour hundred men besides, not all together nor openly, for that was\r\nimpossible in the face of the enemy, who were blockading it, but by\r\nstealth, and in small bodies. So these soldiers took possession of the\r\ncitadel, and the palace with all its furniture, and all the military\r\nstores. There were a good many horses, and every species of artillery\r\nand missile weapon. Also there were arms and armour for seventy thousand\r\nmen, which had been stored up there for a long time, and Dionysius also\r\nhad two thousand soldiers, all of whom he handed over to Timoleon with\r\nthe rest of the fortress, and then, with his money and a few of his\r\nfriends, he put to sea, and passed unnoticed through Hiketes's cruisers.\r\nHe proceeded to the camp of Timoleon, appearing for the first time as a\r\nprivate person in great humility, and was sent to Corinth in one ship,\r\nand with a small allowance of money. He had been born and bred in the\r\nmost splendid and greatest of empires, and had reigned over it for ten\r\nyears, but for twelve more, since the time that Dion attacked him, he\r\nhad constantly been in troubles and wars, during which all the cruelties\r\nwhich he had exercised on others, were more than avenged upon himself,\r\nby the miserable death of his wife and family, which are more\r\nparticularly dwelt upon in the life of Dion.\r\n\r\nXIV. Now when Dionysius reached Corinth, there was no one in Greece who\r\ndid not wish to see him and speak to him. Some, who rejoiced in his\r\nmisfortunes, came to see him out of hatred, in order to trample on him\r\nnow that he was down, while others sympathised with him in his change of\r\nfortune, reflecting on the inscrutable ways of the gods, and the\r\nuncertainty of human affairs. For that age produced nothing in nature or\r\nart so remarkable as that change of fortune which showed the man, who\r\nnot long before had been supreme ruler of Sicily, now dining at Corinth\r\nat the cook's shop, lounging at the perfumer's, drinking at the taverns,\r\ninstructing female singers, and carefully arguing with them about their\r\nsongs in the theatre, and about the laws of music. Some thought that\r\nDionysius acted thus from folly, and indolent love of pleasure, but\r\nothers considered that it was in order that he might be looked down\r\nupon, and not be an object of terror or suspicion to the Corinthians, as\r\nhe would have been if they thought that he ill brooked his reverse of\r\nfortune, and still nourished ambitious designs, and that his foolish and\r\nlicentious mode of life was thus to be accounted for.\r\n\r\nXV. But for all that, certain of his sayings are remembered, which\r\nsufficiently prove that he showed real greatness of mind in adapting\r\nhimself to his altered circumstances. When he arrived at Leukas, which,\r\nlike Syracuse, was a Corinthian colony, he said that he was like a young\r\nman who has got into disgrace. They associate gaily with their brothers,\r\nbut are ashamed to meet their fathers, and avoid them: and so he was\r\nashamed to go to the parent city, but would gladly live there with them.\r\nAnother time in Corinth, when some stranger coarsely jeered at the\r\nphilosophic studies in which he used to delight when in power, and at\r\nlast asked him what good he had obtained from the wisdom of Plato, \"Do\r\nyou think,\" answered he, \"that I have gained nothing from Plato, when I\r\nbear my reverse of fortune as I do.\" When Aristoxenus, the musician, and\r\nsome others asked him what fault he had found with Plato, and why, he\r\nanswered that absolute power, amongst its many evils, was especially\r\nunfortunate in this, that none of a despot's so-called friends dare to\r\nspeak their mind openly. And he himself, he said, had been by such men\r\ndeprived of the friendship of Plato. A man, who thought himself witty,\r\nonce tried to make a joke of Dionysius by shaking out his cloak, when he\r\ncame into his presence, as is the custom before despots, to show that\r\none has no concealed weapons; but he repaid the jest by begging him to\r\ndo it when he left him, that he might be sure that he had not stolen any\r\nof his property.\r\n\r\nPhilip of Macedon once, when they were drinking together, made some\r\nsneering remark about the poetry and tragedies which Dionysius the elder\r\nhad written, pretending to be at a loss to know how he found time for\r\nsuch pursuits; but Dionysius cleverly answered, \"He wrote them during\r\nthe time which you and I, and all who are thought such lucky fellows,\r\nspend over our wine.\"\r\n\r\nPlato never saw Dionysius at Corinth, for he was dead at that time; but\r\nDiogenes of Sinope, when he first met him, said, \"How unworthily you\r\nlive, Dionysius.\" Dionysius answered him, \"Thank you, Diogenes, for\r\nsympathising with my misfortunes.\" \"Why,\" said Diogenes; \"do you suppose\r\nthat I sympathise with you, and am not rather grieved that a slave like\r\nyou, a man fit, like your father, to grow old and die on a miserable\r\nthrone, should be living in luxury and enjoyment amongst us?\" So, when I\r\ncompare with these sayings of his the lamentations which Philistius\r\npours forth over the daughters of Leptines, that they had fallen from\r\nthe glories of sovereign power into a humble station, they seem to me\r\nlike the complainings of a woman who has lost her perfumes, her purple\r\ndresses, or her jewels.\r\n\r\nThese details, I think, for readers who are at leisure, are not foreign\r\nto the design of biography, and not without value.\r\n\r\nXVI. If the fall of Dionysius seems strange, the good fortune of\r\nTimoleon was no less wonderful. Within fifty days of his landing in\r\nSicily, he was master of the citadel of Syracuse, and sent back\r\nDionysius to Peloponnesus. Encouraged by his success, the Corinthians\r\nsent him a reinforcement of two thousand hoplites and two hundred horse.\r\nThese men reached Thurii, but there found it impossible to cross over\r\ninto Sicily, as the Carthaginians held the sea with a great fleet. As it\r\nwas necessary for them to remain there for a time, they made use of\r\ntheir leisure to perform a most excellent action. For the Thurians made\r\nan expedition against the Bruttii,[A] and meanwhile these men took\r\ncharge of their city, and guarded it carefully and trustily as if it had\r\nbeen their own.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The natives of Southern Italy.]\r\n\r\nHiketes meanwhile was besieging the citadel of Syracuse, and preventing\r\ncorn from being brought by sea to the Corinthians. He also obtained two\r\nstrangers, whom he sent to assassinate Timoleon, who, trusting in the\r\nfavour shown him by the gods, was living carelessly and unsuspectingly\r\namong the people of Adranum. These men, hearing that he was about to\r\noffer sacrifice, came into the temple with daggers under their cloaks,\r\nand mingling with the crowd round the altar, kept edging towards him.\r\nThey were just on the point of arranging their attack, when a man struck\r\none of them on the head with his sword, and he fell. Neither the\r\nassailant nor the accomplice of the fallen man stood his ground, but the\r\none with his sword still in his hand ran and took refuge on a high rock,\r\nwhile the other laid hold of the altar, and begged for pardon at\r\nTimoleon's hands if he revealed the whole plot. When assured of his\r\nsafety he confessed that he and the man who had been killed had been\r\nsent thither to assassinate Timoleon. Meanwhile others brought back the\r\nman from the rock, who loudly declared that he had done no wrong, but\r\nhad justly slain him in vengeance for his father, whom this wretch had\r\nkilled at Leontini. Several of those present bore witness to the truth\r\nof his story, and they marvelled much at the ways of Fortune, how she\r\nmakes the most incongruous elements work together to accomplish her\r\npurposes. The Corinthians honoured the man with a present of ten minae,\r\nbecause he had co-operated with the guardian angel of Timoleon, and had\r\nput off the satisfaction of his private wrong until a time when it saved\r\nthe life of the general. This good fortune excited men's feelings so\r\nthat they guarded and reverenced Timoleon as a sacred person sent by\r\nheaven to restore the liberties of Sicily.\r\n\r\nXVII. When Hiketes failed in this attempt on Timoleon, and saw that many\r\nwere joining him, he began to blame himself for only using the great\r\nCarthaginian force that was present by stealth, and as if he was ashamed\r\nof it, concealing his alliance and using them clandestinely, and he sent\r\nfor Mago, their General, to come with all the force at his disposal. He\r\nsailed in with a formidable fleet of a hundred and fifty ships, and took\r\npossession of the harbour, disembarked sixty thousand troops, and\r\nencamped with them in the city of Syracuse, so that all men thought that\r\nthe long-talked-of and expected subjugation of Sicily to the barbarian\r\nwas imminent. For the Carthaginians during their endless wars in Sicily\r\nhad never before taken Syracuse, but now, by the invitation of the\r\ntraitor Hiketes, the city was turned into a barbarian camp. The\r\nCorinthians in the citadel were in a position of great danger and\r\ndifficulty, as they no longer had sufficient provisions, because the\r\nharbours were blockaded, and they perpetually had to divide their forces\r\nfor skirmishes and battles at the walls, and to repel every device and\r\nmethod of attack known in sieges.\r\n\r\nXVIII. Timoleon, however, relieved them by sending corn from Katana in\r\nsmall fishing-smacks and boats, which, chiefly in stormy weather, stole\r\nin through the triremes of the barbarians when they were scattered by\r\nthe roughness of the sea. Mago and Hiketes, perceiving this, determined\r\nto take Katana, from which place the besieged drew their supplies, and\r\nthey sailed from Syracuse with the best of their troops. The Corinthian\r\nNeon, the General in command of the besieged force, observing from the\r\ncitadel that those of the enemy who were left behind kept careless\r\nguard, suddenly fell upon them, and, slaying some and routing the rest\r\nhe made himself master of Achradina, which is the strongest and least\r\nassailable part of the city of Syracuse, which, as it were, consists of\r\nseveral towns.\r\n\r\nBeing now in possession of abundance of provisions and money, he did not\r\nleave the place, and go back to the citadel on the promontory, but\r\nfortified the circuit of Achradina and held it conjointly with the\r\nAcropolis, with which he connected its fortifications. A horseman from\r\nSyracuse brought the news of the capture of Achradina to Mago and\r\nHiketes when they were close to Katana. Alarmed at the news they\r\nreturned with all speed, having neither taken the city they went to\r\ntake, nor kept the one which they had taken.\r\n\r\nXIX. It may be doubted whether these actions owe more to fortune than to\r\ncourage and conduct; but the next event can only be ascribed to fortune.\r\nThe Corinthian troops at Thurii were in fear of the Carthaginian\r\ntriremes under Hanno which were watching them, and as the sea had for\r\nmany days been excessively rough, in consequence of a gale, determined\r\nto march on foot through the Bruttii. Partly by persuasion and partly\r\nby force they made their way to Rhegium, while the sea was still very\r\nstormy. The Carthaginian Admiral, who no longer expected the\r\nCorinthians, and thought that he was waiting there to no purpose,\r\npersuaded himself that he had invented a masterpiece of deceit. He\r\nordered his sailors to crown themselves with garlands, decked out his\r\ntriremes with Greek shields and wreaths of palm, and set out for\r\nSyracuse. As he passed the citadel they cheered loudly, and with\r\nuproarious merriment called out to the garrison that they had come back\r\nafter a complete victory over the Corinthians, hoping by this means to\r\ndispirit the besieged. But while he was playing these silly tricks the\r\nCorinthians had reached Rhegium, and as no one disputed their passage,\r\nand the cessation of the gale had made the straits singularly smooth and\r\ncalm, they embarked in the passage boats and what fishing-smacks were to\r\nbe found, and crossed over into Sicily, so easily and in such calm\r\nweather that they were able to make their horses swim alongside of the\r\nvessels and tow them by their halters.\r\n\r\nXX. As soon as they had crossed, Timoleon met them, and at once obtained\r\npossession of Messina, and, after reviewing them, marched on Syracuse at\r\nonce, confiding more in his good fortune and his former successes than\r\nin the number of his troops, which amounted to no more than four\r\nthousand. When Mago heard of this march, he was much disquieted, and his\r\nsuspicions of his allies were increased by the following circumstance.\r\nIn the marshes round the city, into which runs much fresh water from\r\nsprings and rivers which find their way into the sea, there was a great\r\nquantity of eels, which afforded plenty of sport for those who cared to\r\nfish for them; and the mercenary soldiers on both sides used to meet and\r\nfish whenever there was a cessation of hostilities. As they were all\r\nGreeks, and had no private grounds for hatred, they would cheerfully\r\nrisk their lives in battle against each other, but during times of truce\r\nthey conversed freely. So then, while engaged in fishing, they talked to\r\none another, and admired the beauty of the sea, and the fine situation\r\nof the city. Then one of the Corinthian garrison said, \"Can it be that\r\nyou, Greeks as you are, should be endeavouring to betray to the\r\nbarbarian so great and beautiful a city as this, and that you should be\r\ntrying to establish these base and cruel Carthaginians nearer to our\r\ncountry? Rather ought you to wish that there were more Sicilies to act\r\nas bulwarks of Greece. Do you suppose that these men have gathered\r\ntogether their host from the pillars of Herakles and the Atlantic coast,\r\nand risked their lives at sea, merely to support the dynasty of Hiketes?\r\nHe, if he had the spirit of a real prince, never would have turned out\r\nhis brethren, and invited the enemy into his native land, but would have\r\nmade terms with Timoleon and the Corinthians, and been honoured\r\naccordingly.\" These words were noised abroad in the camp by the\r\nmercenaries, and gave Mago the pretext which he had long been waiting\r\nfor, to abandon their cause on the plea of suspecting their fidelity.\r\nWherefore, although Hiketes begged him to remain, and pointed out how\r\nfar superior he was to the enemy, yet he, thinking that Timoleon's army\r\nsurpassed his in courage and good fortune as much as his did in numbers,\r\nweighed anchor at once and sailed to Africa, letting Sicily slip through\r\nhis fingers, to his great disgrace, for no assignable reason.\r\n\r\nXXI. On the next day appeared Timoleon with his troops in battle array.\r\nAs soon as they learned their departure, and saw the harbour, they\r\nproceeded to mock at the cowardice of Mago, and they sent a crier round\r\nthe city offering a reward to any one who would tell them to what place\r\nthe Carthaginian force had run away. Nevertheless, Hiketes still showed\r\na bold front, and did not relax his hold on the city, and, as the part\r\nwhich was in his possession was strong and hard of access, Timoleon\r\ndivided his army, and himself led the assault on the most difficult side\r\nof the position, by the river Anapus, ordering another body, under Isias\r\nthe Corinthian, to attack from Achradina. A third corps, consisting of\r\nthe newly arrived reinforcement under Deinarchus and Demaretus were to\r\nattack Epipolae. The assault took place simultaneously on all sides. The\r\nspeedy rout of Hiketes and capture of the city may be justly ascribed to\r\nthe skill of the General; but the fact that not one of the Corinthians\r\nwas killed or wounded is due to Timoleon's good fortune, which seemed to\r\nvie with his courage and try to make those who read of his exploits\r\nwonder at their good luck more than their merit.\r\n\r\nIn a few days not only was all Sicily and Italy ringing with his fame,\r\nbut throughout Greece his great successes were known, and the city of\r\nCorinth, which scarcely thought that the expedition had reached Sicily,\r\nheard at the same time that the troops were safe and victorious, so\r\nprosperously did affairs turn out, and with such speed did fortune\r\npublish the glory of his deeds.\r\n\r\nXXII. Timoleon, having thus gained possession of the fortified citadel\r\non the promontory, did not fall into the same snare as Dion, and was not\r\nmoved to spare the place for the sake of its beautiful and costly\r\narchitecture. Dion's jealousy of the people led him to distrust them,\r\nand proved his ruin; but Timoleon took a very different course. He made\r\nproclamation that any Syracusan who chose might come with a crowbar and\r\ntake part in the destruction of the despot's castle. When they had all\r\nassembled, in order to mark that day and that proclamation as the real\r\nbeginning of liberty, they not only destroyed and subverted the castle,\r\nbut also the houses and tombs of the despots. Timoleon at once had the\r\nplace levelled, and built upon it courts of justice, delighting the\r\ncitizens by substituting a republic for a tyranny.\r\n\r\nHaving taken the city, he was now at a loss for citizens, for some had\r\nbeen killed in the wars and revolutions, and some had gone into exile to\r\navoid the despots, so that the market-place of Syracuse was overrun with\r\nherbage so deep and thick that horses were pastured on it, while the\r\ngrooms lay on the grass near them. The other cities, except a very few,\r\nhad become the haunts of deer and wild boars, and persons at leisure\r\nused to hunt them with dogs in the suburbs and round the walls. None of\r\nthose who had taken refuge in the various forts and castles would return\r\nto the city, as they all felt a dread and hatred of public assemblies\r\nand politics, which had produced the greater part of the tyrants under\r\nwhom they had suffered. In this difficulty it occurred to Timoleon and\r\nthe Syracusans to apply to the Corinthians, and ask them to send out\r\nfresh colonists from Greece. Otherwise, they said, the land must lie\r\nuncultivated, and, above all, they were looking forward to a great war\r\nwith Africa, as they heard that on Mago's return the Carthaginians were\r\nso enraged at his failure, that, though he committed suicide to avoid a\r\nworse fate, they had crucified his dead body, and were collecting a\r\ngreat force, meaning next summer to invade Sicily.\r\n\r\nXXIII. When these letters from Timoleon reached them, together with\r\nambassadors from the Syracusans, who besought them to take upon them the\r\ncare of this their poor city, and once again become the founders of it,\r\nthe Corinthians were not tempted by greed to take unfair advantages and\r\nseize the city for themselves, but first sent heralds to all the games\r\nheld in honour of the gods throughout Greece, and to all places where\r\npeople assembled, to proclaim that the Corinthians, having abolished\r\ndespotism at Syracuse and driven out the despot, invite all Syracusans\r\nand other Sicilian Greeks who choose to go and dwell in the city under\r\nfree institutions, receiving an equal and just share of the land. Next\r\nthey sent messengers to Asia Minor and the islands, wherever they heard\r\nthat most of the scattered bands of exiles had settled, and invited them\r\nall to come to Corinth, as the Corinthians would at their own expense\r\nfurnish them with vessels and commanders and a safe convoy to Syracuse.\r\n\r\nBy these proclamations Corinth gained great and well-deserved renown,\r\nseeing that she had forced Syracuse from its tyrants, saved it from the\r\nbarbarians, and given back the country to its own citizens. The exiles,\r\nhowever, when assembled at Corinth found their numbers too small, and\r\nbegged to be allowed to receive among them others from Corinth and the\r\nrest of Greece. When by this means they had raised their numbers to not\r\nless than ten thousand, they sailed to Syracuse. Many citizens from\r\nItaly and Sicily had already joined Timoleon, who, when he found their\r\nnumbers (according to Athanis) amount to sixty thousand, divided the\r\ncountry among them, and sold the houses for a thousand talents,\r\naffording the original citizens the option of purchasing their own\r\nhouses. At the same time, to relieve the financial distress of the\r\nState, with a view to the approaching war, he even sold all the\r\nstatues. A vote of the assembly was taken about each one, and he was\r\ncondemned, like a criminal on his trial. On this occasion they say that\r\nthe Syracusans, though they condemned all the rest, decided on keeping\r\nthat of the ancient prince Gelo, because they admired and respected him\r\nfor his victory over the Carthaginians at Himera.\r\n\r\nXXIV. The life of Syracuse being rekindled by this influx of citizens\r\nfrom all quarters, Timoleon determined to set free the other cities\r\nalso, and to exterminate the despots in Sicily. In the course of his\r\ncampaigns against them he compelled Hiketes to renounce his alliance\r\nwith the Carthaginians, to demolish his castle, and to live in Leontini\r\nas a private citizen. Leptines, the despot of Apollonia and of several\r\nsmaller towns, fearing to be taken by him, surrendered. Timoleon spared\r\nhis life, and sent him to Corinth, as he thought that it reflected\r\ncredit upon his native city, that the despots of Sicily should be seen\r\nby all Greece living there as humble exiles. As for the soldiers whom he\r\nhad in his pay, he determined not to keep them idle, but to support them\r\nby the plunder of an enemy's country. So while he himself returned to\r\nSyracuse, to superintend the reconstruction of the constitution, and to\r\nassist the lawgivers Kephalus and Dionysius in framing the best form of\r\npolity, he sent the troops under Deinarchus and Demaretus to subdue the\r\nwestern portion of the island, which had fallen into the hands of the\r\nCarthaginians. Here they induced several cities to revolt from the\r\nbarbarians, and not only gained abundant pay and plunder for themselves\r\nfrom their conquests, but were able to furnish funds for the approaching\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nXXV. During this time the Carthaginian forces sailed to Lilybaeum with\r\nseventy thousand men, two hundred ships of war, and a thousand\r\ntransports carrying engines of war, four horse chariots, provisions, and\r\nother war material, as they meant no longer to use half measures, but at\r\none swoop to drive the Greeks out of Sicily. Their force indeed was\r\nsufficient for the conquest of the Sikeliot Greeks even if they had not\r\nbeen weakened by their internal strife.\r\n\r\nHearing that their own part of the island was being ravaged, they at\r\nonce in great anger marched to attack the Corinthians, under the command\r\nof Hasdrubal and Hamilcar. News of this quickly reached Syracuse, and\r\nthe great numbers of the enemy caused such panic among the citizens,\r\nthat, numerous as they were, Timoleon could only induce three thousand\r\nto get under arms and follow him. Besides these, there was the paid\r\nforce, four thousand in number; and of these again about a thousand were\r\novercome by their fears on the march, and went back, declaring that\r\nTimoleon could not be in his right senses, but must be insane to march\r\nwith five thousand foot and a thousand horse to attack seventy thousand\r\nmen, and to separate his force eight days' journey from Syracuse, in a\r\nplace where there was no hope of shelter for the fugitives or of\r\nhonourable burial for the dead. Timoleon treated it as an advantage that\r\nthese men disclosed their cowardice before the day of battle. He\r\nencouraged the rest, and led them with all haste to the river Krimesus,\r\nwhere he heard that the Carthaginians were concentrating.\r\n\r\nXXVI. As he was mounting a hill, beyond which he expected to see the\r\ncamp and army of the enemy, there met him some mules loaded with\r\nparsley. It occurred to the soldiers that this was a bad omen, for we\r\ngenerally use parsley for wreathing tombs; indeed from this practice\r\narises the proverb, when a man is dangerously ill, that he is ready for\r\nhis parsley. Wishing to rid them from this superstition and to stop\r\ntheir fears, Timoleon halted them, and made a suitable speech, pointing\r\nout that their crown of victory had come of its own accord into their\r\nhands before the battle, for this is the herb with which the Corinthians\r\ncrown the victors at the Isthmian games, accounting it sacred and\r\npeculiar to their own country. For then parsley was used for the crown\r\nat the Isthmian games, as it is even to this day at those of Nemea, and\r\nthe pine has only been lately introduced. So Timoleon, having addressed\r\nhis soldiers, as has been said, first crowned himself with the parsley,\r\nand then his officers and men did so likewise. But the prophets\r\nperceiving two eagles flying towards them, one of whom carried a snake\r\nin its talons, while the other flew along with loud and inspiriting\r\ncries, pointed them out to the soldiers, who all began to pray and\r\ninvoke the gods.\r\n\r\nXXVII. The time of year was the beginning of summer, near the solstice\r\nat the end of the month Thargelion.[A] A thick mist rose from the river,\r\nand all the plain was concealed in fog, so that nothing could be seen of\r\nthe enemy, but only a confused murmur from the movement of that great\r\nhost reached the hill. The Corinthians, when they had reached the\r\nsummit, paused and piled their arms. Now the sun shone out, and the mist\r\nrose from the valley. Gathering together, it hung in clouds about the\r\nhill-tops, while below, the river Krimesus appeared, with the enemy\r\ncrossing it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: About May.]\r\n\r\nFirst went the four-horse chariots in terrible pomp, all drawn up in\r\nbattle array, while next to them followed ten thousand hoplites with\r\nwhite shields. These they conjectured to be native Carthaginians by the\r\nsplendour of their equipments and their slow and orderly march.\r\nFollowing these came the other nations, turbulently and confusedly\r\nstruggling across. Timoleon, seeing that the river kept off the mass of\r\nthe enemy, and allowed them to fight with just so many as they chose,\r\npointed out to his soldiers how the enemy's array was broken by the\r\nstream, some having crossed, and some being still crossing. He ordered\r\nDemaretus to take the cavalry and charge the Carthaginians, to prevent\r\ntheir having time to form in order of battle. But he himself marched\r\ndown to the plain, having drawn up his force with the other Sicilian\r\nGreeks and a few strangers on each of the wings, but with his Syracusans\r\nand the best of the paid force under his own command in the centre.\r\n\r\nFor a short time he held back, watching the effect of the cavalry\r\ncharge; but seeing that they were unable to come to blows with the\r\nCarthaginians because of the chariots which careered about in front of\r\ntheir ranks, and that they constantly had to fall back to avoid their\r\narray being broken, and then to make short rushes as occasion served, he\r\nhimself took his shield, and called to the infantry to follow him and be\r\nof good cheer. It seemed to them that his voice was more than man's,\r\nand louder than was his wont, either from their faculties being strained\r\nby the excitement of the contest, or else because, as most of them\r\nbelieved, some god shouted with him. Quickly they raised their war-cry\r\nin answer, and begged him to lead them on and wait no longer. Ordering\r\nthe cavalry to ride round the line of chariots and attack the infantry\r\nin flank, he closed up the foremost ranks, and with the trumpet sounding\r\nthe charge, attacked the Carthaginians.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. They manfully encountered his first assault, and being armed\r\nwith iron cuirasses and brass helmets, and protected with large shields,\r\nthey were able to withstand the thrust of the Greek spears. But when the\r\nstruggle came to be decided with swords, where skill as well as strength\r\nwas employed, there suddenly broke upon them from the mountains a\r\nterrible storm of thunder with vivid flashes of lightning. The mist,\r\nwhich had hitherto hung about the mountain peaks, now rolled down on to\r\nthe field of battle, with violent gusts, hail, and rain. The Greeks\r\nreceived it on their backs, while the rain beat into the faces of the\r\nbarbarians, and the lightning dazzled their eyes, as the storm swept\r\nviolently along with frequent flashes from the clouds. These were great\r\ndisadvantages, especially to inexperienced men, as the thunder and the\r\npattering of the rain and hail on their armour prevented their hearing\r\nthe commands of their officers. The Carthaginians, not being lightly\r\nequipped, but, as has been narrated, in complete armour, slipped on the\r\nmuddy ground and were encumbered by the wet folds of their dress, which\r\nrendered them less active in the fight, and easily overcome by the\r\nGreeks, since when they fell in the slippery mud they could not rise\r\nagain with their shields. The river Krimesus, which had been held up by\r\nthe multitudes that were crossing it, was now swollen to a torrent by\r\nthe rain, and the plain through which it runs, lying as it does under\r\nmany steep glens and ravines, was now covered with streams not running\r\nin the ordinary channels, in which the Carthaginians stumbled and were\r\nhard bested.\r\n\r\nAt last, from the violence of the storm, and the Greeks having cut to\r\npieces their front rank, a chosen body of four hundred men, the great\r\nmass turned and fled. Many were overtaken and slain on the plain, and\r\nmany more perished in the river, while the light-armed troops prevented\r\nmost of them from gaining the shelter of the mountains. It was said that\r\namong the myriads of slain there were three thousand citizens of\r\nCarthage--a great loss and grief to that city, for they belonged to the\r\nnoblest and richest classes; nor do we ever hear of so many native\r\nCarthaginians having perished in any one battle before this, as they\r\ngenerally make use of Libyan, Spanish and Numidian troops, so that in\r\ncase of defeat the loss falls upon other nations.\r\n\r\nXXIX. The Greeks discovered the rank of the dead by the richness of\r\ntheir spoil; for when they collected the booty no account was taken of\r\niron or brass, such an abundance was there of silver and gold; for they\r\ncrossed the river and captured the enemy's camp. Of the captives, the\r\ngreater part were stolen by the soldiers, and sold privately, but a body\r\nof five thousand was brought into the common stock. Two hundred chariots\r\nalso were taken. The most glorious and magnificent spectacle of all was\r\nthe tent of Timoleon, round which booty of every kind was piled up in\r\nheaps, among which were a thousand corslets of exquisite workmanship,\r\nand ten thousand shields. As they were but few to gather the plunder of\r\nso many, and as they fell in with such riches, it was only on the third\r\nday that they managed to erect a trophy of their victory. Together with\r\nthe despatch announcing his success, Timoleon sent home to Corinth the\r\nfinest of the arms and armour, desiring to make his country envied by\r\nall men, when they should see, in that alone of all Greek cities, that\r\nthe most important shrines were not adorned with Grecian spoils, nor\r\nwith offerings obtained by the slaughter of men of their own race and\r\nblood, dismal memorials at best, but with spoils of the barbarian, whose\r\ninscriptions bore noble testimony to the justice, as well as the courage\r\nof the victors, telling how the Corinthians and their general, Timoleon,\r\nhaving freed the Greeks who dwell in Sicily from the yoke of Carthage,\r\nset up these thank-offerings to the gods.\r\n\r\nXXX. After the victory he left the paid force in the enemy's country, to\r\nravage and plunder the Carthaginian dominions, and himself proceeded to\r\nSyracuse. He now ordered out of the island those mercenary troops by\r\nwhom he had been deserted before the battle; and even forced them to\r\nquit Sicily before sunset. These men crossed into Italy and perished\r\nthere at the hands of the Bruttians, who broke their word to them and\r\nbetrayed them. This was the penalty which Heaven imposed on them for\r\ntheir desertion. But Mamercus, the despot of Catana, and Hiketes, either\r\nthrough disgust at Timoleon's successes, or else fearing him as a man\r\nnot likely to keep faith with despots, made an alliance with Carthage,\r\nas they said that the Carthaginians, unless they wished to be utterly\r\ndriven out of Sicily, must send a competent force and a general. Gisco\r\nthe son of Hanno sailed thither with seventy ships, and also with a\r\nforce of Greek mercenary soldiers, whom the Carthaginians had never used\r\nbefore; but now they were full of admiration for the Greeks, as being\r\nthe most warlike and invincible of men. Having effected a junction of\r\ntheir forces in the territory of Messina, they cut to pieces a body of\r\nfour hundred foreign soldiers whom Timoleon sent against them; and in\r\nthe Carthaginian dominion they laid an ambush near the place called\r\nHietae, and cut off the hired troops of Euthymus the Leukadian. Both\r\nthese circumstances made the good fortune of Timoleon more renowned. For\r\nthese were some of the men who under Philomelus of Phokis and Onomarchus\r\nsacrilegiously took Delphi, and shared in the plunder of the temple. As\r\nall men loathed them and shrank from them as from men under a curse,\r\nthey wandered about Peloponnesus until Timoleon, being unable to get any\r\nother soldiers, enlisted them in his service. When they reached Sicily,\r\nthey were victorious in every battle which they fought where he was\r\npresent. After the most important struggles of the war were over, they\r\nwere sent to reinforce others, and so perished and came to nought; and\r\nnot all at once, but piecemeal, as if their avenging fate had given way\r\nto Timoleon's good fortune for a season, lest the good should suffer\r\nfrom the punishment of the wicked. Thus the kindness of the gods towards\r\nTimoleon was no less seen and wondered at in his failures than in his\r\nsuccesses.\r\n\r\nXXXI. The people of Syracuse were much nettled by the insulting jests\r\npassed upon them by the despots. Mamercus, who plumed himself on his\r\npoems and tragedies, gave himself great airs after conquering the\r\nmercenaries, and when he hung up their shields as offerings to the gods,\r\nhe inscribed this insolent elegiac couplet upon them.\r\n\r\n    \"These, with purple wrought, and ivory, gold, and amber,\r\n    We with our simple shields conquered and laid in the dust.\"\r\n\r\nAfter these events, while Timoleon was on a campaign in the direction of\r\nKalauria, Hiketes invaded the Syracusan territory, did much damage and\r\ninsult, and retired loaded with spoil, past the very walls of Kalauria,\r\ndespising Timoleon, who had but a small force with him. He, however, let\r\nhim pass, but then pursued with his cavalry and light troops. Hiketes,\r\nperceiving this, halted after crossing the river Damyrias, and drew up\r\nhis troops along the farther bank to dispute the passage, encouraged to\r\ndo so by the different nature of the ford, and the steepness of the\r\nhills on either hand. Now a strange rivalry and contest arose among\r\nTimoleon's captains, which delayed their onset. No one chose to let any\r\none else lead the way against the enemy, but each man wished to be\r\nfirst; so that their crossing was conducted in a disorderly fashion,\r\neach man trying to push by and outstrip the rest. Hereupon Timoleon,\r\nwishing to choose the leaders by lot, took a ring from each. These he\r\nthrew into his own cloak, mixed them up, and showed the first which he\r\ndrew out, which happened to be engraved with the figure of a trophy of\r\nvictory. When the young men saw this they raised a shout of joy, and\r\nwould not wait for the rest to be drawn, but each man, as fast as he\r\ncould, rode through the river and set upon the enemy. Their assault was\r\nirresistible; the enemy fled, all of them throwing away their shields,\r\nand with the loss of a hundred men.\r\n\r\nXXXII. Soon after this, while Timoleon was campaigning in the Leontine\r\ncountry, he took Hiketes alive, with his son Eupolemus, and Euthymus,\r\nthe commander of his cavalry. The soldiers seized and bound them, and\r\nled them into Timoleon's presence. Hiketes and his son were put to death\r\nas despots and traitors; nor did Euthymus meet with compassion, though\r\nhe was a man of renown in athletic contest, and of great personal\r\nbravery, because of a scoffing speech of which he was accused against\r\nthe Corinthians. The story goes that he was addressing the people of\r\nLeontini on the subject of the Corinthian invasion, and told them that\r\nthere was nothing to be alarmed at if\r\n\r\n     \"Corinthian ladies have come out from home.\"[A]\r\n\r\nThus it is that most people seem to suffer more from hard words than\r\nhard deeds, and are more excited by insult than by actual hurt. What we\r\ndo to our enemies in war is done of necessity, but the evil we say of\r\nthem seems to spring from an excess of spite.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: A line in the Medea of Euripides. The point of the joke\r\ndepends on the punctuation, but cannot be kept in translation.]\r\n\r\nXXXIII. On Timoleon's return the Syracusans brought the family and\r\ndaughters of Hiketes before the public assembly for trial, and condemned\r\nthem to death. And this, methinks, is the most heartless of Timoleon's\r\nactions, that for want of a word from him these poor creatures should\r\nhave perished. He seems not to have interfered, and to have let the\r\npeople give full vent to their desire to avenge Dion, who dethroned\r\nDionysius. For Hiketes was the man who threw Dion's wife Arete alive\r\ninto the sea, with her sister Aristomache and her little son, as is told\r\nin the Life of Dion.\r\n\r\nXXXIV. After this he marched against Mamercus at Catana. He beat him in\r\na pitched battle near the river Abolus, routing him with a loss of two\r\nthousand men, no small part of whom belonged to the Phoenician\r\ncontingent under Gisco. Hereupon, at the request of the Carthaginians,\r\nhe made peace, stipulating that they should hold the country beyond the\r\nriver Lykus, and that those who wished should be allowed to have it and\r\ngo to reside at Syracuse, with their families and property, and also\r\nthat they should give up their alliance with the despots. In despair at\r\nthis Mamercus sailed to Italy, to try to bring the Lucanians against\r\nTimoleon and the Syracusans; but he was deserted by his followers, who\r\nturned their ships back, sailed to Syracuse, and surrendered Catana to\r\nTimoleon. Mamercus now was forced to take refuge in Messina with Hippo,\r\nthe despot there. But Timoleon came and besieged it both by sea and\r\nland. Hippo endeavoured to escape on a ship, and was taken. The people\r\nof Messina, to whom he was delivered up, brought every one, even the\r\nboys from school, into the theatre, to witness that most salutary\r\nspectacle, a tyrant meeting with his deserts. He was put to death with\r\ntorture; but Mamercus surrendered himself to Timoleon on condition that\r\nhe should have a fair trial before the people of Syracuse, and that\r\nTimoleon should say nothing against him. When he was brought to Syracuse\r\nhe was brought before the people, and tried to deliver a long\r\npremeditated speech to them, but meeting with interruptions and seeing\r\nthat the assembly was inexorable he flung away his cloak and rushed\r\nacross the theatre, striking his head against a stone step with the\r\nintention of killing himself. However he failed, and paid the penalty of\r\nhis crimes by suffering the death of a pirate.\r\n\r\nXXXV. In this fashion the despotisms were put down by Timoleon, and the\r\nwars finished. The whole island, which had become a mere wilderness\r\nthrough the constant wars, and was grown hateful to the very natives,\r\nunder his administration became so civilized and desirable a country\r\nthat colonists sailed to it from those very places to which its own\r\ncitizens had formerly betaken themselves to escape from it. For Akragas\r\nand Gela, large cities, which after the war with Athens had been\r\ndestroyed by the Carthaginians, were now repeopled; the former colonists\r\nled by Megellus and Pheristus, from Elea on the south coast of Italy,\r\nand the latter by a party led by Gorgus, who sailed from Keos and\r\ncollected together the former citizens.\r\n\r\nWhen these cities were being reorganised Timoleon not only afforded them\r\npeace and safety, but also gave them great assistance, and showed so\r\ngreat an interest in them as to be loved and respected by them as their\r\nreal Founder. The other cities also all of them looked upon him with the\r\nsame feelings, so that no peace could be made by them, no laws\r\nestablished, no country divided among settlers, no constitutional\r\nchanges made that seemed satisfactory, unless he had a hand in them,\r\nand arranged them just as an architect, when a building is finished,\r\ngives some graceful touches which adorn the whole.\r\n\r\nXXXVI. There were many Greeks, in his lifetime, who became great, and\r\ndid great things, such as Timotheus, and Agesilaus, and Pelopidas, and\r\nTimoleon's great model, Epameinondas. But these men's actions produced a\r\nglory which was involved in much strain and toil, and some of their\r\ndeeds have incurred censure, and even been repented of. Whereas those of\r\nTimoleon, if we except the terrible affair of his brother, have nothing\r\nin them to which we cannot apply, like Timaeus, that verse of\r\nSophocles--\r\n\r\n    \"Ye gods, what Venus or what grace divine\r\n    Took part in this.\"\r\n\r\nFor as in the poetry of Antimachus, and the paintings of Dionysius, the\r\nKolophonians, we find a certain vigour and power, yet think them forced\r\nin expression, and produced with much labour, while the paintings of\r\nNikomachus and the verses of Homer, besides their other graces and\r\nmerits, have the charm of seeming to have been composed easily and\r\nwithout effort, so also the campaigns of Timoleon, when compared with\r\nthe laborious and hardly contested ones of Epameinondas or Agesilaus,\r\nseem to have, besides their glory, a wonderful ease, which property is\r\nnot so much to be attributed to good luck as to prosperous valour. He,\r\nhowever, ascribed all his successes to Fortune, for in writing to his\r\nfriends at home, and in his public speeches to the Syracusans, he\r\nfrequently expressed his thankfulness to this goddess, who, having\r\ndetermined to save Sicily, had chosen to ascribe to him the credit of\r\ndoing it. In his house he built a chapel to Automatia,--the goddess\r\nunder whose auspices blessings and glory came as it were of themselves.\r\nTo her he offered sacrifices, and consecrated his house to her. He lived\r\nin a house which the Syracusans had bestowed upon him as a special prize\r\nfor his successes as general, and also the most beautiful and pleasant\r\ncountry seat, where indeed he spent most of his leisure time with his\r\nwife and children, whom he had sent for from Corinth. For he never\r\nreturned to Corinth, nor mixed himself up in the troubles of Greece, nor\r\ndid he expose himself to the hatred of political faction, which is the\r\nrock upon which great generals commonly split, in their insatiate thirst\r\nfor honour and power; but he remained in Sicily, enjoying the blessings\r\nof which he was the author; the greatest of which was to see so many\r\ncities, and so many tens of thousands, all made happy and prosperous by\r\nhis means.\r\n\r\nXXXVII. But since, as Simonides says, all larks must have crests, and\r\nall republics sycophants, so two of the popular leaders, Laphystius and\r\nDemaenetus, attacked Timoleon. When Laphystius was insisting on his\r\ngiving bail for some lawsuit, he would not permit the people to hoot at\r\nhim or stop him; for he said that all his labours and dangers had been\r\nendured to obtain for every Syracusan the right of appealing to the\r\nlaws. Demaenetus made many attacks in the public assembly on his\r\ngeneralship; but he made him no answer except to declare his\r\nthankfulness to the gods for having granted his prayer that he might see\r\nall Syracusans in possession of liberty of speech.\r\n\r\nThough he confessedly had performed the greatest and most glorious\r\nactions of any Greek of his time, and though he had gained the glory of\r\nhaving alone done that which the orators in their speeches at great\r\npublic meetings used to urge the entire nation to attempt, he was\r\nfortunately removed from the troubles which fell upon ancient Greece,\r\nand saved from defiling his hands with the blood of his countrymen. His\r\ncourage and conduct were shown at the expense of barbarians and despots;\r\nhis mildness of temper was experienced by Greeks; he was able to erect\r\nthe trophies for most of his victories, without causing tears and\r\nmourning to the citizens; but nevertheless, within eight years, he\r\nrestored Sicily to its native inhabitants, freed from the scourges which\r\nhad afflicted it for so long a time and seemed so ineradicable. When\r\nadvanced in years he suffered from a dimness of sight, which soon became\r\ntotal blindness. He had done nothing to cause it, and had met with no\r\naccident, but the disease was congenital, and in time produced a\r\ncataract. Many of his relatives are said in a similar fashion to have\r\nlost their sight when advanced in years. But Athanis tells us that\r\nduring the war with Hippo and Mamercus, at the camp at Mylae, his\r\neyesight became affected, and that this was noticed by all, but that he\r\ndid not on that account desist from the siege, but persevered in the\r\nwar, till he captured the two despots; but as soon as he returned to\r\nSyracuse he resigned his post of commander-in-chief, begging the\r\ncitizens to allow him to do so, as the war had been brought to a happy\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. That he endured his misfortune without repining is not to be\r\nwondered at; but one must admire the respect and love shown him when\r\nblind by the people of Syracuse. They constantly visited him, and\r\nbrought with them any strangers that might be staying with them, both to\r\nhis town and country house, to show them their benefactor, glorying in\r\nthe fact that he had chosen to spend his life amongst them, and had\r\nscorned the magnificent reception which his exploits would have ensured\r\nhim, had he returned to Greece. Of the many important tributes to his\r\nworth none was greater than the decree of the Syracusans that whenever\r\nthey should be engaged in war with foreign tribes, they would have a\r\nCorinthian for their general. Great honour was also reflected upon him\r\nby their conduct in the public assembly; for, though they managed\r\nordinary business by themselves, on the occasion of any important debate\r\nthey used to call him in. Then he would drive through the market-place\r\ninto the theatre; and when the carriage in which he sat was brought in,\r\nthe people would rise and salute him with one voice. Having returned\r\ntheir greeting, and allowed a short time for their cheers and blessings,\r\nhe would hear the disputed point debated, and then give his opinion.\r\nWhen this had been voted upon his servants would lead his carriage out\r\nof the theatre, while the citizens, cheering and applauding him as he\r\nwent, proceeded to despatch their other business without him.\r\n\r\nXXXIX. Cherished in his old age with such respect and honour, as the\r\ncommon father of his country, Timoleon at length, after a slight\r\nillness, died. Some time was given for the Syracusans to prepare his\r\nfuneral, and for neighbours and foreigners to assemble, so that the\r\nceremony was performed with great splendour. The bier, magnificently\r\nadorned, and carried by young men chosen by lot, passed over the place\r\nwhere once the castle of Dionysius had been pulled down. The procession\r\nwas joined by tens of thousands of men and women, whose appearance was\r\ngay enough for a festival, for they all wore garlands and white robes.\r\nTheir lamentations and tears mingled with their praises of the deceased\r\nshowed that they were not performing this as a matter of mere outward\r\nrespect and compliance with a decree, but that they expressed real\r\nsorrow and loving gratitude. At last, when the bier was placed upon the\r\npyre, Demetrius, the loudest voiced of the heralds at that time, read\r\naloud the following:--\r\n\r\n\"The Syracusan people solemnise, at the cost of two hundred minae, the\r\nfuneral of this man, the Corinthian Timoleon, son of Timodemus. They\r\nhave passed a vote to honour him for all future time with festival\r\nmatches in music, horse and chariot races, and gymnastics, because,\r\nafter having put down the despots, subdued the foreign enemy, and\r\nrecolonized the greatest among the ruined cities, he restored to the\r\nSicilian Greeks their constitution and laws.\"[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Grote.]\r\n\r\nThey buried him in the market-place, and afterwards surrounded the spot\r\nwith a colonnade, and built a palastra in it for the young men to\r\npractise in, and called it the Timoleonteum; and, living under the\r\nconstitution and laws which he established, they passed many years in\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF AEMILIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.[A] Most writers agree that the Aemilian was one of the most noble\r\nand ancient of the patrician families of Rome. Those who tell us that\r\nKing Numa was a pupil of Pythagoras, narrate also that Mamercus, the\r\nfounder of this family, was a son of that philosopher, who for his\r\nsingular grace and subtlety of speech was surnamed Aemilius. Most of the\r\nmembers of the family who gained distinction by their valour, were also\r\nfortunate, and even the mishap of Lucius Paullus at Cannae bore ample\r\ntestimony to his prudence and valour. For since he could not prevail\r\nupon his colleague to refrain from battle, he, though against his better\r\njudgment, took part in it, and disdained to fly; but when he who had\r\nbegun the contest fled from it, he stood firm, and died fighting the\r\nenemy. This Aemilius had a daughter, who married Scipio the Great, and a\r\nson who is the subject of this memoir. Born in an age which was rendered\r\nillustrious by the valour and wisdom of many distinguished men, he\r\neclipsed them all, though he followed none of the studies by which young\r\nmen were then gaining themselves a reputation, but chose a different\r\npath. He did not practise at the bar, nor could he bring himself to\r\ncourt the favour of the people by the greetings, embraces, and\r\nprofessions of friendship to which most men used to stoop to obtain\r\npopularity. Not that he was by nature unfitted for such pursuits; but he\r\nconsidered it better to gain a reputation for courage, justice, and\r\ntruth, in which he soon outshone his contemporaries.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: In Sintenis's text the chapter with which this life usually\r\nbegins is prefixed to the Life of Timoleon.]\r\n\r\nIII. The first honourable office for which he was a candidate was that\r\nof aedile, for which he was elected against twelve others, who, they\r\nsay, all afterwards became consuls. When chosen a priest of the college\r\nof Augurs, whom the Romans appoint to watch and register the omens\r\nderived from the flight of birds, or the signs of the heavens, he so\r\ncarefully applied himself to learning the ancient customs and religion\r\nof his ancestors, that the priesthood, hitherto merely considered as an\r\nempty title of honour and sought after for that reason only, became\r\nregarded as the sublimest craft of all, confirming the saying of the\r\nphilosophers, that holiness consists in a knowledge of how to serve the\r\ngods. Under him everything was done with both zeal and skill. He\r\nneglected all other duties, when engaged upon these, neither omitting\r\nany part nor adding any, arguing with his companions, when they blamed\r\nhim for his care about trifles, that though a man might think that\r\nheaven was merciful and forgiving of negligences, yet that habitual\r\ndisregard and overlooking of such points was dangerous for the state,\r\nseeing that no one ever begins till some flagrant breach of the law to\r\ndisturb the constitution, but those who are careless of accuracy in\r\nsmall things soon begin to neglect the most important. He was no less\r\nsevere in exacting and maintaining military discipline than with\r\nreligious observances, never forgetting the general in the demagogue,\r\nnor, as many then did, endeavouring to make his first command lead to a\r\nsecond by indulgence and affability to his troops, but, like a priest\r\nexpounding mysteries, he carefully taught them everything requisite for\r\na campaign, and, by his severity to the careless and disobedient,\r\nrestored the former glory to his country; for he seemed to think victory\r\nover the enemy was merely a subordinate incident in the great work of\r\ndisciplining his fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nIV. When the Romans were at war with Antiochus the Great, and all their\r\nmost experienced generals were employed against him, there arose another\r\nwar in the west of Europe, in consequence of revolutionary movements in\r\nSpain. Aemilius was appointed commander to conduct this war, not with\r\nsix lictors only, like ordinary generals, but twelve, so as to give him\r\nconsular authority. He defeated the barbarians in two pitched battles,\r\nwith a loss of nearly thirty thousand. The credit of this exploit\r\nbelongs peculiarly to the general, who made such use of the advantage of\r\nthe ground, and the ford over a certain river, as to render victory an\r\neasy matter for his soldiers. He also took two hundred and fifty cities,\r\nwhich opened their gates to him. Having established a lasting peace in\r\nhis province he returned to Rome, not having gained a penny by his\r\ncommand. For he was careless of money-making, though he spent his\r\nfortune without stint; and it was so small, that after his death it\r\nhardly sufficed to make up the dower of his wife.\r\n\r\nV. He married Papiria, the daughter of Papirius Maso, a consular; and\r\nafter living with her for a considerable time, divorced her, though he\r\nhad by her an illustrious family, for she was the mother of the renowned\r\nScipio, and of Fabius Maximus. No reason for their separation has come\r\ndown to us, but there is much truth in that other story about a divorce,\r\nthat some Roman put away his wife; and his friends then blamed him,\r\nsaying, \"Is she not chaste? is she not beautiful? is she not fruitful?\"\r\nHe, stretching out his shoe, said, \"Is it not beautiful? is it not new?\r\nBut none of you can tell where it pinches me. In fact, some men divorce\r\ntheir wives for great and manifest faults, yet the little but constant\r\nirritation which proceeds from incompatible tempers and habits, though\r\nunnoticed by the world at large, does gradually produce between married\r\npeople breaches which cannot be healed.\"\r\n\r\nSo Aemilius put away Papiria, and married again. By his second marriage\r\nhe had two sons, whom he kept at home, but those by the former marriage\r\nhe had adopted into the greatest and noblest families of Rome, the elder\r\ninto that of Fabius Maximus, who had five times been consul, while the\r\nyounger was treated by Scipio Africanus as his cousin, and took the name\r\nof Scipio.\r\n\r\nOf his two daughters, one married a son of Cato, the other Aelius\r\nTubero, an excellent man, who supported his poverty more gloriously than\r\nany other Roman. There were sixteen in the family, all Aelii; and one\r\nsmall house and estate sufficed for them all, with their numerous\r\noffspring and their wives, among whom was the daughter of our Aemilius,\r\nwho, though her father had twice been consul and twice triumphed, was\r\nnot ashamed of the poverty of her husband, but was proud of the virtue\r\nthat kept him poor. But nowadays brothers and kinsmen, unless their\r\ninheritances be divided by mountain ranges, rivers, and walls like\r\nfortifications, with plenty of space between them, quarrel without\r\nceasing. These are the materials for reflection which history affords to\r\nthose who choose to make use of them.\r\n\r\nVI. Aemilius, when elected consul, marched against the sub-Alpine\r\nLigurians, called by some Ligustines, a brave and spirited nation, and\r\nfrom their nearness to Rome, skilled in the arts of war. Mixed with the\r\nGauls, and the Iberians of the sea coast, they inhabit the extremity of\r\nItaly where it dies away into the Alps, and also that part of the Alps\r\nwhich is washed by the Tuscan Sea, opposite the Libyan coast. At this\r\ntime they took also to seafaring, and, sailing forth in small piratical\r\nships, they plundered and preyed upon commerce as far as the columns of\r\nHeracles. On Aemilius's approach they opposed him, forty thousand\r\nstrong; but he, with only eight thousand, attacked five-fold his own\r\nnumbers, put them to rout, and having chased them into their fastnesses,\r\noffered them reasonable and moderate terms; for it was not the Roman\r\npolicy utterly to exterminate the Ligurian race, but to leave them as an\r\noutwork to protect Italy against the constant movements of the Gaulish\r\ntribes.\r\n\r\nTrusting in Aemilius they surrendered all their ships and their cities\r\ninto his hands. He did the cities no hurt, or at most destroyed the\r\nwalls, and restored them to the owners, but he carried off all the\r\nships, leaving them nothing larger than a six-oared boat; while he set\r\nfree the numerous captives which they had taken both by sea and land,\r\namong whom were some Roman citizens. These were his glorious exploits in\r\nthat consulship. Afterwards he frequently let his desire for re-election\r\nbe seen, and once became a candidate, but as he failed and was passed\r\nover, he thenceforth remained in retirement, occupying himself with\r\nreligious matters, and teaching his children not only the Roman\r\neducation in which he himself had been brought up, but also the Greek,\r\nand that more carefully. For not only were the grammarians,\r\nphilosophers, and orators Greek, but also the sculptors and painters,\r\nand the young men kept Greeks to manage their horses and hounds, and\r\ninstruct them in hunting. Aemilius, unless hindered by public business,\r\nalways was present at the exercises and studies of his sons, and was the\r\nkindest father in Rome.\r\n\r\nVII. This was the period during which the Romans, who were at war with\r\nPerseus, King of Macedon, complained of their generals, whose ignorance\r\nand cowardice had led to the most disgraceful and ridiculous failure,\r\nand to the sustaining of much more loss than they inflicted. They, who\r\nhad just driven Antiochus, called the Great, out of Asia Minor, beyond\r\nTaurus, and restricted him to Syria, making him glad to purchase peace\r\nat the price of fifteen thousand talents; who, a little before, had\r\ncrushed Philip in Thessaly, and set free the Greeks from the power of\r\nMacedon; and who had also utterly subdued Hannibal himself, a man whose\r\ndaring and immense resources rendered him far more dangerous an opponent\r\nthan any king, thought that it was not to be borne that Perseus should\r\nwage war as if he were on equal terms with the Roman people, and that,\r\ntoo, with only the remnants of his father's routed forces; for they did\r\nnot know that Philip, after his defeat, had greatly increased the power\r\nand efficiency of the Macedonian army. To explain which, I shall briefly\r\nrelate the story from the beginning.\r\n\r\nVIII. Antigonus, who was the most powerful of the generals and\r\nsuccessors of Alexander, and who obtained for himself and his family the\r\ntitle of king, had a son named Demetrius, whose son was Antigonus,\r\ncalled Gonatas. His son again was named Demetrius, who, after reigning\r\nsome short time, died, leaving a son Philip, a mere boy in years.\r\nFearing disturbance during his minority, the Macedonian nobles made\r\nAntigonus, a cousin of the deceased, Regent and commander-in-chief,\r\nassociating with him in this office the mother of Philip. Finding him a\r\nmoderate and useful ruler, they soon gave him the title of king. He had\r\nthe soubriquet of Doson, as though he were only a promiser, not a\r\nperformer of his engagements. After this man, Philip came to the throne,\r\nand, while yet a boy, distinguished himself in all that becomes a king,\r\nso as to raise men's hopes that he might restore the empire of Macedon\r\nto its ancient glory, and be alone able to check the power of Rome,\r\nwhich now menaced the whole world. Defeated in a great battle at\r\nScotussa by Titus Flamininus, he bent to the storm, surrendered all that\r\nhe had to the Romans, and was thankful for mild treatment. Afterwards,\r\nchafing at his subordinate position, and thinking that to reign\r\ndependent on the pleasure of the Romans was more worthy of a slave who\r\ncares only for sensual pleasure, than of a man of spirit, he gave his\r\nwhole mind up to preparations for war, and secretly and unscrupulously\r\ncollected materials for it. Of the cities in his kingdom, he allowed\r\nthose on the sea-coast and the main roads to fall into partial decay, so\r\nthat his power might be despised, while he collected great forces in the\r\ninterior. Here he filled all the outposts, fortresses, and cities with\r\narms, money, and men fit for service, and thus trained the nation for\r\nwar, yet kept his preparations secret. In his arsenals were arms for\r\nthirty thousand men; eight million medimni of corn were stored in his\r\nfortresses, and such a mass of treasure as would pay an army of ten\r\nthousand men for ten years. But before he could put all these forces in\r\nmotion and begin the great struggle, he died of grief and remorse, for\r\nhe had, as he admitted, unjustly put his other son Demetrius to death on\r\nthe calumnies of one far worse than he was. Perseus, the survivor,\r\ninherited his father's hatred of the Romans with his kingdom, but was\r\nnot of a calibre to carry out his designs, as his small and degraded\r\nmind was chiefly possessed by avarice. He is said not even to have been\r\nlegitimate, but that Philip's wife obtained him when a baby from his\r\nreal mother, a midwife of Argos, named Gnathaina, and palmed him off\r\nupon her husband. And this seems to have been one reason for her putting\r\nDemetrius to death, for fear that if the family had a legitimate heir,\r\nthis one's bastardy would be discovered.\r\n\r\nIX. However, low-born and low-minded though he was, yet having by the\r\nforce of circumstances drifted into war, he held his own and maintained\r\nhimself for a long time against the Romans, defeating generals of\r\nconsular rank with great armies, and even capturing some of them.\r\nPublius Licinius, who first invaded Macedonia, was defeated in a cavalry\r\nengagement, with a loss of two thousand five hundred brave men killed,\r\nand six hundred prisoners. Perseus next by a sudden attack made himself\r\nmaster of the Roman naval station at Oreus, took twenty store ships,\r\nsunk the rest, which were loaded with grain, and took also four\r\nquinqueremes.[A] He fought also a second battle, in which he drove back\r\nthe consular general Hostilius, who was trying to invade Macedonia near\r\nElimiae; and when he tried to steal in through Thessaly, he again\r\noffered battle, which the Roman declined. As an accessory to the war he\r\nnow made a campaign against the Dardans, as if affecting to despise the\r\nRomans and to be at leisure. Here he cut to pieces ten thousand of the\r\nbarbarians, and carried off much plunder. He also had secret\r\nnegotiations with the Gauls who dwell near the Ister, called Basternae,\r\na nation of warlike horsemen, and by means of Genthius their king he\r\nendeavoured to induce the Illyrians to take part in the war. There was\r\neven a report that the barbarians had been induced by his bribes to\r\nmarch through the southern part of Gaul beside the Adriatic, and so\r\ninvade Italy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Ships of war with five banks of oars.]\r\n\r\nX. The Romans, when they learnt all this, determined that they would\r\ndisregard political influence in their choice of a general, and choose\r\nsome man of sense and capable of undertaking great operations. Such a\r\none was Paulus Aemilius, a man of advanced age, being about sixty years\r\nold, but still in full vigour of body, and surrounded by kinsmen,\r\ngrown-up sons, and friends, who all urged him to listen to the appeal of\r\nhis country and be consul. He at first treated the people with little\r\nrespect, and shunned their eager professions of zeal, on the plea that\r\nhe did not wish for the command; but as they waited on him daily, and\r\ncalled for him to come into the forum and shouted his name, he was at\r\nlength prevailed upon. When a candidate, he seemed to enter the field\r\nnot with a view to getting office, but to giving victory and strength in\r\nbattle to his fellow-citizens; with such zeal and confidence did they\r\nunanimously elect him consul for the second time, not permitting lots\r\nto be cast for provinces by the two consuls, as is usual, but at once\r\ndecreeing to him the management of the Macedonian war. It is said that\r\nwhen he was named general against Perseus, he was escorted home in\r\ntriumph by the people _en masse_, and found his daughter Tertia, who was\r\nquite a little child, in tears. He embraced her, and asked her why she\r\nwas crying; and she, throwing her arms round him and kissing him, said,\r\n\"Do you not know, father, that our Perseus is dead?\" meaning a little\r\ndog which she had brought up, which was so named. Aemilius said, \"May\r\nthis bring good luck, my daughter: I accept the omen.\" This story Cicero\r\nthe orator tells in his book on Divination.\r\n\r\nXI. It being the custom that the consuls-elect should return thanks, and\r\nmake a gracious speech to the people from the rostrum, Aemilius called\r\ntogether the people and said that he had sought for his former\r\nconsulship because he wanted office, but for this one because they\r\nwanted a general: wherefore he felt no gratitude towards them, but would\r\nlay down his consulship if they thought that they would succeed better\r\nin the war under some one else; but if they felt confidence in him, he\r\nasked them not to interfere with his acts as general, nor to gossip\r\nabout him, but to furnish quietly what was wanted for the war; for if\r\nthey tried to command their commander they would afford even a more\r\nsorry spectacle than they had already done. By these words he made the\r\ncitizens stand greatly in awe of him, and gave them great expectations\r\nof what he would effect, while all rejoiced that they had passed over\r\nthose who used to flatter them, and had chosen a general of independence\r\nand spirit. So much did the Roman people respect bravery and honour,\r\nbecause it led to conquests, and to making them masters of the world.\r\n\r\nXII. I consider it to have been by divine favour that Aemilius Paulus on\r\nstarting for his campaign met with such a fortunate and calm voyage, and\r\nso speedily and safely arrived at the camp; but as to the war itself,\r\nand his conduct of it, accomplished as it was partly by swift daring,\r\npartly by wise dispositions, by the valour of friends, confidence in the\r\nmidst of dangers, and reliance on sound plans, I cannot tell of any\r\nglorious and distinguished exploit, which, as in the case of other\r\ngenerals, owed its success to his good fortune; unless, indeed, any one\r\nshould count as good fortune for Aemilius the avarice of Perseus, which\r\ndestroyed the great and well-founded hopes of the Macedonians in the\r\nwar, and brought them to ruin by the meanness of their chief. At his\r\nrequest there came a force of Basternae, a thousand horse and ten\r\nthousand light troops who fought with them, all mercenary soldiers--men\r\nwho knew nothing of tilling the soil, or of sailing the sea, who did not\r\nlive from the produce of their flocks, but who studied one art and\r\nbusiness solely, ever to fight and overcome their antagonists. So, when\r\nin the camp at Maedike, these men mixed with the king's troops, tall in\r\ntheir person, admirable in their drill, boastful and haughty in their\r\ndefiance of the foe, they gave confidence to the Macedonians, and made\r\nthem think that the Romans never could withstand their attack, but would\r\nbe terrified at their appearance and march, outlandish and ferocious as\r\nit was. But Perseus, now that he had got such auxiliaries as these, and\r\nput his men into such heart, because he was asked for a thousand staters\r\nfor each officer, became bewildered at the amount of the sum which he\r\nwould have to pay, and his meanness prevailing over his reason, refused\r\ntheir offers, and broke off the alliance, as if he had been steward of\r\nhis kingdom for the Romans rather than fighting against them, and had to\r\ngive an exact account of his expenses in the war to his enemies; though\r\nhe might have been taught by them, who had besides other war materials,\r\na hundred thousand soldiers collected together ready for use. Yet he,\r\nwhen engaged in war with such a power as this, where such great forces\r\nwere kept on foot to contend with him, kept doling out and sparing his\r\nmoney as if it were not his own. And still he was not a Lydian or\r\nPhoenician, but a man who from his descent ought to have had a share of\r\nthe spirit of Philip and Alexander, who made all their conquests by the\r\nprinciple that empire may be gained by gold, not gold by empire. It\r\nused, indeed, to be a proverb that \"It is not Philip, but Philip's gold\r\nthat takes the cities of Greece.\" Alexander, too, when beginning his\r\nIndian campaign, seeing the Macedonians laboriously dragging along the\r\nrich and unwieldy plunder of the Persians, first burned all the royal\r\ncarriages, and then persuaded the soldiers to do the like with their\r\nown, and start for the war as light as if they had shaken off a burden.\r\nBut Perseus, when spending his own money to defend himself, his\r\nchildren, and his kingdom, rather than sacrifice a little and win,\r\npreferred to be taken to Rome with many others, a rich captive, and show\r\nthe Romans how much he had saved for them.\r\n\r\nXIII. For not only did he dismiss the Gauls and break his word to them,\r\nbut after inducing Genthius the Illyrian to take part in the war for a\r\nbribe of three hundred talents, he lodged the money with that prince's\r\nenvoys, all counted, and let them put their seals upon it. Genthius then\r\nthinking that he had got what he asked, did a wicked and impious deed in\r\nseizing and throwing into prison some Roman ambassadors who were sent to\r\nhim. Perseus, thinking that Genthius no longer needed money to make him\r\nhostile to Rome, since he had given him such a pledge of his hatred of\r\nit, and had involved himself in war with it by such a crime, deprived\r\nthe poor man of his three hundred talents, and shortly afterwards looked\r\ncalmly on while he and his family were plucked out of their kingdom,\r\nlike birds out of a nest, by Lucius Anicius, who was sent with an army\r\nagainst him. Aemilius, when he came to contend with such a rival as\r\nthis, despised him as a man, but was surprised at the force which he had\r\nat his disposal. These were four thousand cavalry, and of infantry\r\nsoldiers of the Macedonian phalanx nearly forty thousand. Encamped by\r\nthe sea-shore, near the skirts of Mount Olympus, on ground nowhere\r\naccessible, and strongly fortified by himself with outworks and defences\r\nof wood, Perseus lived in careless security, thinking that by time and\r\nexpense he should wear out Aemilius's attack. But he, while he busied\r\nhis mind with every possible mode of assault, perceiving that his army\r\nin consequence of its past want of discipline was impatient, and usurped\r\nthe general's province by proposing all sorts of wild schemes, severely\r\nreprimanded the soldiers, and ordered them not to meddle with what was\r\nnot their concern, but only take care that they and their arms were\r\nready, and to use their swords as Romans should when their general\r\nshould give the word. He ordered the night sentries to go on guard\r\nwithout their spears, that they might be more attentive and less\r\ninclined to sleep, having no arms to defend themselves against the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nXIV. The army was chiefly troubled by want of water; for only a very\r\nlittle bad water ran or rather dripped out of a spring near the sea.\r\nAemilius perceiving that Olympus, immediately above him, was a large and\r\nwell-wooded mountain, and guessing from the greenness of the foliage\r\nthat it must contain some springs which had their courses underground,\r\ndug many pits and wells along the skirts of the mountain, which\r\nimmediately were filled with pure water, which by the pressure above was\r\ndriven into these vacant spaces. Yet some say that there are no hidden\r\nfountains of water, lying ready in such places as these, and say that it\r\nis not because they are dug out or broken into that they flow, but that\r\nthey have their origin and cause in the saturation of the surrounding\r\nearth which becomes saturated by its close texture and coldness, acting\r\nupon the moist vapours, which when pressed together low down turn into\r\nwater. For just as women's breasts are not receptacles full of milk\r\nready to flow, but change the nutriment which is in them into milk, and\r\nso supply it, so also the cold places which are full of springs have no\r\nwater concealed in them, nor any such reservoirs as would be needed to\r\nsend out deep rivers from any fixed point, but by their pressure they\r\nconvert the air and vapour which is in them into water. At any rate,\r\nthose places which are dug over break more into springs and run more\r\nwith water, in answer to this treatment of their surface, just as\r\nwomen's breasts respond to sucking, for it moistens and softens the\r\nvapour; whereas land which is not worked is incapable of producing\r\nwater, not having the motion by which moisture is obtained. Those who\r\nargue thus have given sceptics the opportunity of saying, that if it be\r\ntrue, there can be no blood in animals, but that it gathers about\r\nwounds, and that the flow of blood is produced by the air, or some\r\nchange which takes place in the flesh. They are proved to be wrong by\r\nthose who sink shafts for mines, and meet with rivers in the depths of\r\nthe earth, which have not collected themselves by degrees, as would be\r\nthe case if they derived their origin from the sudden movements of the\r\nearth, but flow with a full stream. Also, when mountains and rocks are\r\nfissured by a blow, there springs out a gush of water, which afterwards\r\nceases. But enough of this.\r\n\r\nXV. Aemilius remained quiet for some days, and it is said two such great\r\nhosts never were so near together and so quiet. After exploring and\r\ntrying every place he discovered that there was still one pass\r\nunguarded, that, namely, through Perrhaebae by Pythium and Petra. He\r\ncalled a council of war to consider this, being himself more hopeful of\r\nsuccess that way, as the place was not watched, than alarmed at the\r\nprecipices on account of which the enemy neglected it. First of those\r\npresent, Scipio, surnamed Nasica, son-in-law to Scipio Africanus,\r\nafterwards a leading man in the Senate, volunteered to lead the party\r\nwhich was to make this circuitous attack. And next Fabius Maximus, the\r\neldest of the sons of Aemilius, though still only a youth, rose and\r\nspiritedly offered his services. Aemilius, delighted, placed under their\r\ncommand not so many troops as Polybius says in his history, but so many\r\nas Nasica himself tells us that he had, in a letter which he wrote to\r\none of the princes of that region about this affair. He had three\r\nthousand Italians, besides his main body, and five thousand who composed\r\nthe left wing. Besides these, Nasica took a hundred and twenty horse,\r\nand two hundred of Harpalus's light troops, Thracians and Cretans mixed.\r\nHe began his march along the road towards the sea, and encamped near the\r\ntemple of Herakles, as though he intended to sail round to the other\r\nside of the enemy's camp, and so surround him: but when the soldiers had\r\nsupped, and it was dark, he explained his real plan to his officers,\r\nmarched all night away from the sea, and halted his men for rest near\r\nthe temple of Apollo. At this place Olympus is more than ten furlongs\r\nhigh: and this is proved by the epigram which the measurer wrote as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"The height of Olympus' crest at the temple of Pythian Apollo\r\n     consists of (measured by the plumb line) ten stades, and\r\n     besides a hundred feet all but four. It was Xenagoras, the son\r\n     of Eumelus, who discovered its height. King Apollo, hail to\r\n     thee; be thou propitious to us.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet geometricians say that neither the height of any mountain nor\r\nthe depth of any sea is above ten stades (furlongs). However, Xenophanes\r\ndid not take its altitude conjecturally, but by a proper method with\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nXVI. Here then Nasica halted. Perseus in the morning saw Aemilius's army\r\nquiet in its place, and would have had no idea of what was going on had\r\nnot a Cretan deserter come and told him of the flank march of the\r\nRomans. Then he became alarmed, but still did not disturb his camp, but,\r\nplacing ten thousand foreign mercenaries and two thousand Macedonians\r\nunder the command of Milo, ordered him to march swiftly and occupy the\r\npasses. Now Polybius says that the Romans fell upon these men when they\r\nwere in their beds, but Nasica tells us that a sharp and dangerous\r\nconflict took place upon the heights. He himself was assailed by a\r\nThracian, but struck him through the breast with his spear. However, the\r\nenemy were forced back; Milo most shamefully fled in his shirt, without\r\nhis arms, and Scipio was able to follow, and at the same time lead his\r\nforces on to level ground. Perseus, terrified and despairing when he saw\r\nthem, at once broke up his camp and retreated. But still he was obliged\r\neither to give battle before Pydna, or else to disperse his army among\r\nthe various cities of the kingdom, and so to await the Romans, who,\r\nbeing once entered into his country, could not be driven out without\r\nmuch slaughter and bloodshed. It was urged by his friends that he had a\r\ngreat numerical superiority, and that the troops would fight desperately\r\nin defence of their wives and families, especially if their king took\r\nthe command and shared their danger. He pitched his camp and prepared\r\nfor battle, viewed the ground, and arranged the commands, intending to\r\nset upon the Romans as soon as they appeared. Now the position both\r\npossessed a flat plain for the manoeuvres of the phalanx, which requires\r\nlevel ground, and also hills rising one above another offered refuges\r\nand means for outflanking the enemy to his light troops. Also two\r\nrivers, the Aeson and Leukus, which ran across as it, though not very\r\ndeep at that season (late autumn), were expected to give some trouble to\r\nthe Romans.\r\n\r\nXVII. Aemilius, on effecting a junction with Nasica, marched in battle\r\narray against the enemy. When, however, he saw their position and their\r\nnumbers, he halted in surprise, considering within himself what he\r\nshould do. His young officers, eager for battle, rode up to him and\r\nbegged him not to delay. Conspicuous among these was Nasica, excited by\r\nhis successful flank march round Olympus. Aemilius smiled at them and\r\nanswered, \"I would do so if I were of your age, but many victories have\r\nshown me the mistakes of the vanquished, and prevent my attacking a body\r\nof men drawn up in a chosen position with troops on the march and\r\nundeployed.\" He gave orders that those troops who were in front should\r\ngather together and appear to be forming in battle array, while those\r\nwho were behind pitched their palisades and fortified a camp. Then by\r\nwheeling off men by degrees from the front line, he gradually broke up\r\nhis line of battle, and quietly drew all his forces within the ramparts\r\nof his camp. When night fell, and after supper the army had betaken\r\nitself to sleep and rest, suddenly the moon, which was full and high in\r\nthe heavens, became obscured, changed colour, and became totally\r\neclipsed. The Romans, after their custom, called for her to shine again\r\nby clattering with brass vessels, and uplifting blazing faggots and\r\ntorches. The Macedonians did nothing of the sort, but dismay spread over\r\ntheir camp, and they muttered under their breath that this portended the\r\neclipse of their king. Now Aemilius was not unacquainted with the\r\nphenomena of eclipses, which result from the moon being at fixed periods\r\nbrought into the shadow of the earth and darkened, until it passes the\r\nobscured tract and is again enlightened by the sun, yet being very\r\ndevout and learned in divination, he offered to her a sacrifice of\r\neleven calves. At daybreak he sacrificed twenty oxen to Herakles without\r\nobtaining a favourable response; but with the one-and-twentieth\r\nfavourable signs appeared and portents of victory for them, provided\r\nthey did not attack. He then vowed a hecatomb and sacred games in\r\nhonour of the god, and ordered his officers to arrange the men in line\r\nof battle. But he waited till the sun declined and drew towards the\r\nwest, that his troops might not fight with the morning sun in their\r\neyes. He passed away the day sitting in his tent, which was pitched\r\nlooking towards the flat country and the camp of the enemy.\r\n\r\nXVIII. Some writers tell us, that about evening, by a device of\r\nAemilius, the battle was begun by the enemy, the Romans having driven a\r\nhorse without a bridle out of their camp and then tried to catch it,\r\nfrom which pursuit the battle began; but others say that Roman soldiers\r\nwho were carrying fodder for the cattle were set upon by the Thracians\r\nunder Alexander, and that to repel them a vigorous sortie was made with\r\nseven hundred Ligurians; that many on both sides came up to help their\r\ncomrades, and so the battle began. Aemilius, like a pilot, seeing by the\r\nmotion and disturbance of his camp that a storm was at hand, came out of\r\nhis tent, and going along the lines of the infantry spoke encouraging\r\nwords to them, while Nasica, riding up to the skirmishers, saw the whole\r\narmy of the enemy just on the point of attacking. First marched the\r\nThracians, whose aspect they saw was most terrible, as they were tall\r\nmen, dressed in dark tunics, with large oblong shields and greaves of\r\nglittering white, brandishing aloft long heavy swords over their right\r\nshoulders. Next to the Thracians were the mercenaries, variously armed,\r\nand mixed with Paeonians. After these came a third corps, of\r\nMacedonians, picked men of proved courage, and in the flower of their\r\nage, glittering with gilded arms and new purple dresses. Behind them\r\nagain came the phalanxes from the camp with their brazen shields,\r\nfilling all the plain with the glittering of their armour, and making\r\nthe hills ring with their shouts. So swiftly and boldly did they advance\r\nthat those who were first slain fell two furlongs only from the Roman\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\nXIX. When the battle began, Aemilius came up, and found the front ranks\r\nof the Macedonians had struck their spear-heads into the Roman shields,\r\nso that they could not reach them with their swords. When also the other\r\nMacedonians took their shields off their shoulders and placed them in\r\nfront, and then at the word of command all brought down their pikes, he,\r\nviewing the great strength of that serried mass of shields, and the\r\nmenacing look of the spears that bristled before them, was amazed and\r\nterrified, having never seen a more imposing spectacle--and often\r\nafterwards he used to speak of that sight, and of his own feelings at\r\nit. At the time, however, he put on a cheerful and hopeful look, and\r\nrode along the ranks showing himself to the men without helmet or\r\ncuirass. But the Macedonian king, according to Polybius, having joined\r\nbattle, was seized with a fit of cowardice, and rode off to the city on\r\nthe pretext that he was going to sacrifice to Herakles, a god unlikely\r\nto receive the base offerings of cowards or to fulfil their unreasonable\r\nprayers; for it is not reasonable that he who does not shoot should hit\r\nthe mark, nor that he who does not stand fast at his post should win the\r\nday, or that the helpless man should succeed or the coward prosper. But\r\nthe god heard the prayers of Aemilius, for he prayed for victory whilst\r\nfighting, sword in hand, and invited the god into the battle to aid him.\r\nNot but what one Poseidonius, who says that he took part in these\r\ntransactions, and wrote a history of Perseus in many volumes, says that\r\nit was not from cowardice, or on the pretext of offering sacrifice that\r\nhe left the field, but that on the day before the battle he was kicked\r\non the leg by a horse; that in the battle, though in great pain, and\r\nentreated by his friends to desist, he ordered a horse to be brought,\r\nand without armour rode up to the phalanx. Here as many missiles were\r\nflying about from both sides, an iron javelin struck him, not fairly\r\nwith its point, but it ran obliquely down his left side, tearing his\r\ntunic, and causing a dark bruise on his flesh, the scar of which was\r\nlong visible. This is what Poseidonius urges in defence of Perseus.\r\n\r\nXX. Now as the Romans when they met the phalanx could make no impression\r\nupon it, Salovius, the leader of the Pelignians, seized the standard of\r\nhis regiment and threw it among the enemy. The Pelignians, as the loss\r\nof a standard is thought to be a crime and an impiety by all Italians,\r\nrushed to the place, and a fierce conflict began there with terrible\r\nslaughter. The one party tried to dash aside the long spears with their\r\nswords, and to push them with their shields, and to seize them away with\r\ntheir very hands, while the Macedonians, wielding their spears with both\r\nhands, drove them through their opponents, armour and all: for no shield\r\nor corslet could resist their thrust. They then cast over their own\r\nheads the bodies of these Pelignians and Marrucini, who pressed madly\r\nlike wild creatures up to the line of spears and certain death. When the\r\nfirst rank fell in this manner, those behind gave way: it cannot be said\r\nthat they fled, but they retreated to a mountain called Olokrus.\r\nPoseidonius tells us that Aemilius tore his clothes in despair at seeing\r\nthese men give ground, while the other Romans were confounded at the\r\nphalanx, which could not be assailed, but with its close line of spears,\r\nlike a palisade, offered no point for attack. But when he saw that, from\r\nthe inequalities of the ground, and the length of their line, the\r\nMacedonian phalanx did not preserve its alignment, and was breaking into\r\ngaps and breaches, as is natural should happen in a great army,\r\naccording to the different attacks of the combatants, who made it bulge\r\ninwards in one place, and outward in another, then he came swiftly up,\r\nand dividing his men into companies, ordered them to force their way\r\ninto the spaces and intervals of the enemy's line, and to make their\r\nattack, not in any one place all together, but in several, as they were\r\nbroken up into several bodies. As soon as Aemilius had given these\r\ninstructions to the officers, who communicated them to the men, they\r\ncharged into the spaces, and at once some attacked the now helpless\r\nMacedonians in flank, while others got into their rear and cut them off.\r\nThe phalanx dissolved immediately, and with it was lost all the power\r\nand mutual assistance which it gave. Fighting in single combats or small\r\ngroups, the Macedonians struck in vain with their little daggers at the\r\nstrong shields reaching to their feet carried by the Romans. Their light\r\ntargets could ill ward off the blows of the Roman sword, which cut right\r\nthrough all their defensive armour. After a useless resistance they\r\nturned and fled.\r\n\r\nXXI. But the fight was a sharp one. Here Marcus, the son of Cato,\r\nAemilius's son-in-law, whilst fighting with great valour let fall his\r\nsword. Educated as he had been in the strictest principles of honour,\r\nand owing it to such a father to give extraordinary proofs of courage,\r\nhe thought that life would be intolerable for him if he allowed an enemy\r\nto carry off such a trophy from him, and ran about calling upon every\r\nfriend or acquaintance whom he saw to help him to recover it. Many brave\r\nmen thus assembled, and with one accord left the rest of the army and\r\nfollowed him. After a sharp conflict and much slaughter, they succeeded\r\nin driving the enemy from the ground, and having thus chased it, they\r\nbetook themselves to searching for the sword. When at last after much\r\ntrouble it was found among the heaps of arms and corpses, they were\r\noverjoyed, and with a shout assailed those of the enemy who still\r\nresisted. At length the three thousand picked men were all slain\r\nfighting in their ranks. A great slaughter took place among the others\r\nas they fled, so that the plain and the skirts of the hills were covered\r\nwith corpses, and the stream of the river Leukus ran red with blood even\r\non the day after the battle; for, indeed, it is said that more than\r\ntwenty-five thousand men perished. Of the Romans there fell a hundred,\r\naccording to Poseidonius, but Nasica says only eighty.\r\n\r\nXXII. This battle, fraught with such important issues, was decided in a\r\nremarkably short time; beginning to fight at the ninth hour, the Romans\r\nwere victorious before the tenth. The remainder of the day was occupied\r\nin pursuit, which being pressed for some fifteen (English) miles, it was\r\nlate before they returned to their camp. All the officers on their\r\nreturn were met by their servants with torches, and conducted with songs\r\nof triumph to their tents, which were illuminated and wreathed with ivy\r\nand laurel; but the general himself was deeply dejected. The youngest of\r\nthe two sons who were serving under him--his own favourite, the noblest\r\nof all his children in character--was nowhere to be found; and it was\r\nfeared that, being high-spirited and generous, though but a boy in\r\nyears, he must have become mixed up with the enemy, and so perished. The\r\nwhole army learned the cause of his sorrow and perplexity, and quitting\r\ntheir suppers, ran about with torches, some to the tent of Aemilius, and\r\nsome outside the camp to look for him among the corpses. The whole camp\r\nwas filled with sorrow, and all the plain with noise, covered as it was\r\nwith men shouting for Scipio--for he had won all hearts from the very\r\nbeginning, having beyond all his kinsfolk the power of commanding the\r\naffections of men. Very late at night, after he had been all but given\r\nup for lost, he came in with two or three comrades, covered with the\r\nblood of the enemies he had slain, having, like a well-bred hound, been\r\nthoughtlessly carried along by the joy of the chase. This was that\r\nScipio who afterwards took by storm Carthage and Numantia, and became by\r\nfar the most famous and powerful of all the Romans of his time. So\r\nfortune, deferring to another season the expression of her jealousy at\r\nhis success, now permitted Aemilius to take an unalloyed pleasure in his\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nXXIII. Perseus fled from Pydna to Pella, his cavalry having, as one\r\nwould expect, all got safe out of the action. But when the infantry met\r\nthem, they abused them as cowards and traitors, and began to push them\r\nfrom their horses and deal them blows, and so Perseus, terrified at the\r\ndisturbance, forsook the main road, and to avoid detection took off his\r\npurple robe and laid it before him, and carried his crown in his hand;\r\nand, that he might talk to his friends as he walked, he got off his\r\nhorse, and led him. But one of them made excuse that he must tie his\r\nshoes, another that he must water his horse, another that he must get\r\nhimself a drink, and so they gradually fell off from him and left him,\r\nnot fearing the rage of the enemy so much as his cruelty: for,\r\nexasperated by his defeat, he tried to fasten the blame of it upon\r\nothers instead of himself. When he came to Pella, his treasurers Euktus\r\nand Eulaeus met him and blamed him for what had happened, and in an\r\noutspoken and unseasonable way gave him advice: at which he was so much\r\nenraged that he stabbed them both dead with his dagger. After this no\r\none stayed with him except Evander a Cretan, Archedamus an Aetolian, and\r\nNeon a Boeotian. Of the common soldiers the Cretans followed him, not\r\nfrom any love they bore him, but being as eager for his riches as bees\r\nare for honey. For he carried great store of wealth with him, and out of\r\nit distributed among the Cretans cups and bowls and other gold and\r\nsilver plate to the amount of fifty talents. But when he reached first\r\nAmphipolis, and then Galepsus, and had got a little the better of his\r\nfears, his old malady of meanness attacked him, and he would complain to\r\nhis friends that he had flung some of the drinking cups of Alexander the\r\nGreat to the Cretans by mistake, and entreated with tears those who had\r\nthem to give back and take the value in money. Those who understood his\r\ncharacter were not taken in by this attempt to play the Cretan with men\r\nof Crete, but some believed him and lost their cups for nothing. For he\r\nnever paid the money, but having swindled his friends out of thirty\r\ntalents, which soon fell into the hands of the enemy, he sailed with the\r\nmoney to Samothrace, and took sanctuary in the temple of the Dioskuri as\r\na suppliant.\r\n\r\nXXIV. The people of Macedon have always been thought to love their\r\nkings, but now, as if some main prop had broken, and the whole edifice\r\nof government fallen to the ground, they gave themselves up to Aemilius,\r\nand in two days constituted him master of the entire kingdom. This seems\r\nto confirm the opinion of those who say that these successes were owing\r\nto especial good fortune: and the incident of the sacrifice also was\r\nclearly sent from Heaven. For when Aemilius was offering sacrifice at\r\nAmphipolis, when the sacred rites had been performed, lightning came\r\ndown upon the altar, and burned up the offering. But in its miraculous\r\ncharacter and good luck the swiftness with which the news spread\r\nsurpasses all these; for on the fourth day after Perseus had been\r\nvanquished at Pydna, while the people at Rome were assembled at a horse\r\nrace, suddenly there arose amongst them a rumour that Aemilius had\r\ndefeated Perseus in a great battle and had subdued all Macedonia. This\r\nreport soon spread among the populace, who expressed their joy by\r\napplause and shouts throughout the city all that day. Afterwards, as the\r\nreport could be traced to no trustworthy source, but was merely repeated\r\namong them vaguely, it was disbelieved and came to nothing; but in a few\r\ndays they learned the real story, and wondered at the rumour which had\r\npreceded it, combining truth with falsehood.\r\n\r\nXXV. There is a legend that the news of the battle on the river Sagra in\r\nItaly against the natives was carried the same day into Peloponnesus,\r\nand that of the battle of Mykale against the Medes was so carried to\r\nPlataea. The victory of the Romans over the Latins under the exiled\r\nTarquins was reported at Rome a little after it took place, by two men,\r\ntall and fair, who came from the army. These men they conjectured to\r\nhave been the Dioskuri (Castor and Pollux). The first man who fell in\r\nwith them as they stood in the forum, near the fountain, found them\r\nwashing their horses, which were covered with sweat. He marvelled much\r\nat their tale of the victory; and then they are said to have smiled\r\nserenely and stroked his beard, which instantly changed from black to\r\nyellow, thus causing his story to be believed, besides winning for him\r\nthe soubriquet of Ahenobarbus, which means 'brazen beard.' But that\r\nwhich happened in our own time will make all these credible. When\r\nAntonius rebelled against Domitian, and a great war in Germany was\r\nexpected, Rome was greatly disturbed till suddenly there arose among the\r\npeople a rumour of victory, and a story ran through Rome that Antonius\r\nhimself was killed, and that the army under him had been utterly\r\nexterminated. And this report was so clear and forcible, that many of\r\nthe magistrates offered sacrifice for the victory. When the originator\r\nof it was sought for, as he could not be found, but the story when\r\ntraced from one man to another was lost in the vast crowd as if in the\r\nsea, and appeared to have no solid foundation, all belief in it died\r\naway: but when Domitian set out with his forces to the war, he was met\r\non the way by messengers with despatches describing the victory. The day\r\nof this success was the same as that stated by the rumours, though the\r\nplaces were more than two thousand five hundred (English) miles distant.\r\nAll men of our own time know this to be true.\r\n\r\nXXVI. Cnaeus Octavius, the admiral under Aemilius's orders, now cruised\r\nround Samothrace. He did not, from religious motives, violate Perseus's\r\nright of sanctuary, but prevented his leaving the island and escaping.\r\nBut nevertheless Perseus somehow outwitted him so far as to bribe one\r\nOroandes, a Cretan, who possessed a small vessel, to take him on board.\r\nBut this man like a true Cretan took the money away by night, and\r\nbidding him come the next night with his family and attendants to the\r\nharbour near the temple of Demeter, as soon as evening fell, set sail.\r\nNow Perseus suffered pitiably in forcing himself, and his wife and\r\nchildren, who were unused to hardships, through a narrow window in the\r\nwall, and set up a most pititul wailing when some one who met him\r\nwandering on the beach showed him the ship of Oroandes under sail far\r\naway at sea. Day was now breaking, and having lost his last hope, he\r\nmade a hasty retreat to the town wall, and got into it with his wife,\r\nbefore the Romans, though they saw him, could prevent him. But his\r\nchildren he had entrusted to a man named Ion, who once had been a\r\nfavourite of his, but now betrayed him, and delivered them up to the\r\nRomans, thus providing the chief means to compel him, like a wild\r\nanimal, to come and surrender himself into the hands of those who had\r\nhis children. He felt most confidence in Nasica, and inquired for him,\r\nbut as he was not present, after lamenting his fate, and reflecting on\r\nthe impossibility of acting otherwise, he surrendered himself to Cnaeus.\r\n\r\nNow he was able to prove that he had a vice yet more sordid than\r\navarice, namely, base love of life; by which he lost even his title to\r\npity, the only consolation of which fortune does not deprive the fallen.\r\nHe begged to be brought into the presence of Aemilius, who, to show\r\nrespect to a great man who had met with a terrible misfortune, rose, and\r\nwalked to meet him with his friends, with tears in his eyes. But Perseus\r\noffered a degrading spectacle by flinging himself down upon his face and\r\nembracing his knees, with unmanly cries and entreaties, which Aemilius\r\ncould not endure to listen to; but looking on him with a pained and sad\r\nexpression, said, \"Wretched man: why do you by this conduct deprive\r\nfortune of all blame, by making yourself seem to deserve your mishaps,\r\nand to have been unworthy of your former prosperity, but worthy of your\r\npresent misery? And why do you depreciate the value of my victory, and\r\nmake my success a small one, by proving degenerate and an unworthy\r\nantagonist for Romans? Valour, however unfortunate, commands great\r\nrespect even from enemies: but the Romans despise cowardice, even though\r\nit be prosperous.\"\r\n\r\nXXVII. However, he raised him from the ground, and, having given him his\r\nhand, he entrusted him to Tubero, and then taking into his own tent his\r\nsons, sons-in-law, and most of the younger officers, he sat silent,\r\nwrapt in thought for some time, to their astonishment. Then he said,\r\n\"Ought a man to be confident that he deserves his good fortune, and\r\nthink much of himself when he has overcome a nation, or city, or empire;\r\nor does fortune give this as an example to the victor also of the\r\nuncertainty of human affairs, which never continue in one stay? For what\r\ntime can there be for us mortals to feel confident, when our victories\r\nover others especially compel us to dread fortune, and while we are\r\nexulting, the reflection that the fatal day comes now to one, now to\r\nanother, in regular succession, dashes our joy. Can we, who in less than\r\nan hour have trampled under our feet the successor of Alexander the\r\nGreat, who was so powerful and mighty, and who see these kings who but\r\nlately were guarded by their tens of thousands of foot and thousands of\r\nhorse, now receiving their daily bread from the hands of their foes, can\r\nwe suppose that our present prosperity is likely to endure for all time?\r\nYou, young men, be sure that you lay aside your haughty looks and\r\nvainglory in your victory, and await with humility what the future may\r\nbring forth, ever considering what form of retribution Heaven may have\r\nin store for us to set off against our present good fortune.\" They say\r\nthat Aemilius spoke long in this strain, and sent away his young\r\nofficers with their pride and boastfulness well curbed and restrained by\r\nhis words, as though with a bridle.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. After these events he sent the army into cantonments, to rest,\r\nand he himself set out to visit Greece, making a progress which was both\r\nglorious and beneficent; for in the cities to which he came he restored\r\nthe popular constitutions, and bestowed on them presents, from the\r\nking's treasury, of corn and oil. For so much, they say, was found\r\nstored up, that all those who received it and asked for it, were\r\nsatisfied before the mass could be exhausted. At Delphi, seeing a large\r\nsquare column of white marble, on which a golden statue of Perseus was\r\nto have been placed, he ordered his own to be placed there, as the\r\nvanquished ought to give place to the victors. At Olympia, as the story\r\ngoes, he uttered that well-known saying, that Pheidias had carved the\r\nvery Zeus of Homer.\r\n\r\nWhen ten commissioners arrived from Rome, he restored to the Macedonians\r\ntheir country to dwell in, and their cities free and independent,\r\nimposing upon them a tribute of a hundred talents, only half what they\r\nused to pay to their kings. He exhibited gymnastic spectacles of every\r\nkind, and gave splendid sacrifices and feasts in honour of the gods,\r\nhaving boundless resources for the purpose in the king's treasury; and\r\nin ordering and arranging each man's place at table, and saluting him\r\naccording to his merit and degree, he showed such a delicate perception\r\nof propriety, that the Greeks were astonished that he should carry his\r\nadministrative talent even into his amusements, and be so business-like\r\nin trifles. But he was always delighted that though many splendid things\r\nwere prepared, he himself was the chief object of interest to his\r\nguests, and when they expressed their surprise at his taking such pains,\r\nhe would answer that the same mind can array an army for battle in the\r\nmost terrific fashion, or a feast in the most acceptable one. All men\r\npraised to the skies his generous magnanimity, because, when a great\r\nmass of gold and silver was collected from the king's treasury, he would\r\nnot so much as look at it, but handed it over to the quaestors to be put\r\ninto the public treasury. Of all the spoil, he only allowed his sons,\r\nwho were fond of reading, to take the king's books; and when\r\ndistributing prizes for distinguished bravery in action, he gave Aelius\r\nTubero, his son-in-law, a silver cup of five pounds' weight. This Tubero\r\nis he whom we said lived with fifteen other kinsfolk on a small farm,\r\nwhich supported them all. And that, they say, was the first piece of\r\nplate that ever was seen in the Aelian household, brought there by\r\nhonourable valour; for before that neither they nor their wives used\r\neither gold or silver plate.\r\n\r\nXXIX. When he had settled all things properly he took leave of the\r\nGreeks, and reminding the Macedonians to keep by orderly and unanimous\r\nconduct the liberty which the Romans had bestowed upon them, he started\r\nfor Epirus, as the Senate had passed a decree that the soldiers who had\r\nbeen present in the battle against Perseus should be gratified with the\r\nspoil of the cities of Epirus. Desiring therefore to fall upon them all\r\nat once and unexpectedly, he sent for ten of the chief men from each\r\ncity, and ordered them to bring together, on a fixed day, all the gold\r\nand silver which they had in their houses and temples. With each party\r\nhe sent, as if for this purpose, a guard of soldiers and a captain, who\r\nwas to pretend that he came to seek for and receive the money. But when\r\nday broke, they all at the same time fell to sacking and plundering the\r\ncities, so that, in one hour, a hundred and fifty thousand people were\r\nreduced to slavery, and seventy cities plundered; yet from such ruin and\r\ndestruction as this, there resulted no more than eleven drachmae for\r\neach soldier, while all mankind shuddered at this termination of the\r\nwar, that a whole nation should be cut to pieces to produce such a\r\npitiful present.\r\n\r\nXXX. Aemilius, having performed this work, greatly against his real\r\nnature, which was kind and gentle, proceeded to Oricum, and thence\r\ncrossed to Italy with his army. He himself sailed up the river Tiber in\r\nthe king's own ship of sixteen banks of oars, adorned with the arms of\r\nthe vanquished, and crowns of victory and crimson flags, so that all the\r\npeople of Rome came out in a body as if to a foretaste of the spectacle\r\nof his triumphal entry, and walked beside his ship as she was gently\r\nrowed up the river. But the soldiery, casting longing glances at the\r\nking's treasure, like men who had not met with their deserts, were angry\r\nand dissatisfied with Aemilius; for this reason really, though the\r\ncharge they openly put forward was that he was a harsh and tyrannical\r\nruler: so they showed no eagerness for the triumph.\r\n\r\nServius Galba,[A] an enemy of Aemilius, who had once commanded a legion\r\nunder him, hearing this, plucked up spirit to propose openly that he\r\nshould not be allowed a triumph. He disseminated among the soldiers many\r\ncalumnies against their general, and so still more exasperately their\r\npresent temper; next he asked the tribunes of the plebs for another day,\r\nas that day would not suffice for his speech, only four hours remaining\r\nof it. However, the tribunes bade him speak, and he, beginning a long\r\nand abusive speech, consumed all the time. At nightfall the tribunes\r\ndismissed the assembly. But the soldiers, now grown bolder, assembled\r\nround Galba, and, forming themselves into an organized body, again at\r\ndaybreak occupied the capitol; for it was thither that the tribunes had\r\nsummoned the people.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: He had been military tribune of the second legion in\r\nMacedonia. Liv. xlv. 35.]\r\n\r\nXXXI. The voting began as soon as it was day, and the first tribe voted\r\nagainst the triumph. Soon the rumour of this spread to the rest of the\r\npeople and to the Senate. Though the masses were grieved at the shameful\r\ntreatment of Aemilius, they exhausted themselves in useless clamour, but\r\nthe leading men of the Senate crying out one to another that what was\r\ngoing on was scandalous, encouraged each other to resist the licentious\r\nviolence of the soldiers, who, if not restrained, were ready to use any\r\nkind of lawless violence to prevent Paulus Aemilius enjoying the reward\r\nof his victory. These men pushed the mob aside, and mounting to the\r\ncapitol in a body, bade the tribunes stop the voting until they had said\r\nwhat they wished to the people. When voting ceased and silence was\r\nobtained, Marcus Servilius, a man of consular rank, who had challenged\r\nand slain twenty-three enemies in single combat, spoke as\r\nfollows:--\"What a commander Aemilius Paulus must be, you are now best\r\nable to judge, seeing with what a disobedient and worthless army he has\r\nsucceeded in such great exploits; but I am surprised at the people's\r\nbeing proud of the triumphs over the Illyrians and Ligurians, and\r\nbegrudging itself the sight of the king of Macedon brought alive, and\r\nall the glories of Philip and Alexander carried captive to the arms of\r\nRome. Is it not a strange thing that on the unfounded rumour of this\r\nvictory being circulated, you sacrificed to the gods, praying that you\r\nsoon might behold this spectacle, yet now that the army has returned\r\nafter a real victory, you refuse the gods the honour and yourself the\r\npleasure of it, as if you feared to see the extent of your successes, or\r\nwished to spare the feelings of your captive enemy; though it would show\r\na nobler feeling than pity for him, not to deprive your general of his\r\ntriumph for a mean grudge. Your baseness has reached such a pitch that a\r\nman without a scar, with his body delicately nurtured in the shade,\r\ndares to speak about generalship and triumphs before us who have learned\r\nby so many wounds to judge of a general's vice and virtues.\" As he\r\nspoke, he opened his clothes, and showed his breast with an incredible\r\nnumber of scars upon it; then turning to Galba, who had made some\r\nremarks not very decent \"You laugh,\" said he, \"at these other marks: but\r\nI glory in them before my countrymen, for I got them by riding, night\r\nand day, in their service. But come, bring them to vote; I will go\r\namongst them and follow them all to the poll, that I may know those who\r\nare cowardly and ungrateful, and like rather to be ruled by a demagogue\r\nthan by a true general.\"\r\n\r\nXXXII. These words are said to have caused such remorse and repentance\r\namong the soldiers, that all the tribes voted Aemilius his triumph. It\r\nis said to have been celebrated thus. The people, dressed in white\r\nrobes, looked on from platforms erected in the horse course, which they\r\ncall the Circus, and round the Forum, and in all other places which gave\r\nthem a view of the procession. Every temple was open, and full of\r\nflowers and incense, and many officials with staves drove off people who\r\nformed disorderly mobs, and kept the way clear. The procession was\r\ndivided into three days. The first scarcely sufficed for the display of\r\nthe captured statues, sculptures, and paintings, which were carried on\r\ntwo hundred and fifty carriages. On the following day the finest and\r\nmost costly of the Macedonian arms and armour were borne along in many\r\nwaggons, glittering with newly burnished brass and iron, and arranged in\r\na carefully studied disorder, helmets upon shields, and corslets upon\r\ngreaves, with Cretan targets, Thracian wicker shields and quivers mixed\r\nwith horses' bits, naked swords rising out of these, and the long spears\r\nof the phalanx ranged in order above them, making a harmonious clash of\r\narms, as they were arranged to clatter when they were driven along, with\r\na harsh and menacing sound, so that the sight of them even after victory\r\nwas not without terror. After the waggons which bore the arms walked\r\nthree thousand men, carrying the silver coin in seven hundred and fifty\r\nearthen vessels, each carrying three talents, and borne by four men.\r\nOthers carried the silver drinking horns, and goblets and chalices, each\r\nof them disposed so that it could be well seen, and all remarkable for\r\ntheir size and the boldness of their carving.\r\n\r\nXXXIII. On the third day, at earliest dawn, marched the trumpeters, not\r\nplaying the music of a march, but sounding the notes which animate the\r\nRomans for a charge. After them were led along a hundred and twenty fat\r\noxen with gilded horns, adorned with crowns and wreaths. They were led\r\nby youths clad in finely-fringed waistcloths in which to do the\r\nsacrifice, while boys carried the wine for the libations in gold and\r\nsilver vessels. After these came men carrying the gold coin, divided\r\ninto vessels of three talents each like the silver. The number of these\r\nvessels was eighty all but three. Then came those who carried the\r\nconsecrated bowl which Aemilius had made of ten talents of gold adorned\r\nwith jewels, and men carrying the plate of Antigonus and Seleukus, and\r\ncups of Therikles-ware,[A] and all Perseus's own service of gold plate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: This was a particular kind of pottery, originally made at\r\nCorinth.]\r\n\r\nNext came the chariot of Perseus with his armour; and his crown set upon\r\nthe top of his armour: and then after a little interval came the captive\r\nchildren of the king, and with them a tearful band of nurses and\r\nteachers, who held out their hands in supplication to the spectators,\r\nand taught the children to beg them for mercy. There were two boys and\r\none girl, all too young to comprehend the extent of their misfortune.\r\nThis carelessness made their fallen state all the more pitiable, so that\r\nPerseus himself walked almost unnoticed; for the Romans in their pity\r\nhad eyes only for the children, and many shed tears, while all felt that\r\nthe sight was more painful than pleasing till the children were gone by.\r\n\r\nXXXIV. Behind the children and their attendants walked Perseus himself,\r\ndressed in a dark-coloured cloak with country boots, seeming to be dazed\r\nand stupefied by the greatness of his fall. A band of his friends and\r\nassociates followed him with grief-laden countenances, and, by their\r\nconstantly looking at Perseus, and weeping, gave the spectators the idea\r\nthat they bewailed his fate without taking any thought about their own.\r\nHowever, Perseus had sent to Aemilius asking to be excused the walking\r\nin procession; but he, as it seems in mockery of his cowardice and love\r\nof life, answered, \"That was formerly in his own hands, and is now if he\r\npleases.\" Meaning that death was preferable to dishonour; but the\r\ndastard had not spirit enough for that, but buoyed up by some hope,\r\nbecame a part of his own spoils.\r\n\r\nAfter these were borne golden crowns, four hundred in number, which the\r\ncities of Greece had sent to Aemilius with deputations, in recognition\r\nof his success. Next he came himself, sitting in a splendid chariot, a\r\nman worth looking upon even without his present grandeur, dressed in a\r\npurple robe sprinkled with gold, and holding a branch of laurel in his\r\nright hand. All the army was crowned with laurel and followed the car of\r\nthe general in military array, at one time singing and laughing over old\r\ncountry songs, then raising in chorus the paean of victory and recital\r\nof their deeds, to the glory of Aemilius, who was gazed upon and envied\r\nby all, disliked by no good man. Yet it seems that some deity is charged\r\nwith tempering these great and excessive pieces of good fortune, and\r\nskimming as it were the cream off human life, so that none may be\r\nabsolutely without his ills in this life; but as Homer says, they may\r\nseem to fare best whose fortune partakes equally of good and evil.\r\n\r\nXXXV. For he had four sons, two, as has been already related, adopted\r\ninto other families, Scipio and Fabius; and two others who were still\r\nchildren, by his second wife, who lived in his own house. Of these, one\r\ndied five days before Aemilius's triumph, at the age of fourteen, and\r\nthe other, twelve years old, died three days after it; so that there was\r\nno Roman that did not grieve for him, and all trembled at the cruelty of\r\nfortune, which had burst into a house filled with joy and gladness, and\r\nmingled tears and funeral dirges with the triumphal paeans and songs of\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nXXXVI. Yet Aemilius, rightly thinking that courage is as valuable in\r\nsupporting misfortunes as it is against the Macedonian phalanx, so\r\narranged matters as to show that for him the evil was overshadowed by\r\nthe good, and that his private sorrows were eclipsed by the successes of\r\nthe state, lest he should detract from the importance and glory of the\r\nvictory. He buried the first child, and immediately afterwards\r\ntriumphed, as we have said: and when the second died after the triumph,\r\nhe assembled the people and addressed them, not so much in the words of\r\none who needs consolation, as of one who would console his countrymen,\r\nwho were grieved at his misfortunes. He said, that he never had feared\r\nwhat man could do to him, but always had feared Fortune, the most fickle\r\nand variable of all deities; and in the late war she had been so\r\nconstantly present with him, like a favouring gale, that he expected now\r\nto meet with some reverse by way of retribution. \"In one day,\" said he,\r\n\"I crossed the Ionian sea from Brundisium to Corcyra; on the fifth day I\r\nsacrificed at Delphi; in five more I entered upon my command in\r\nMacedonia, performed the usual lustration of the army; and, at once\r\nbeginning active operations, in fifteen days more I brought the war to a\r\nmost glorious end. I did not trust in my good fortune as lasting,\r\nbecause every thing favoured me, and there was no danger to be feared\r\nfrom the enemy, but it was during my voyage that I especially feared\r\nthat the change of fortune would befall me, after I had conquered so\r\ngreat a host, and was bearing with me such spoils and even kings as my\r\ncaptives. However, I reached you safe, and saw the city full of gladness\r\nand admiration and thanksgiving, but still I had my suspicions about\r\nFortune, knowing that she never bestows any great kindness unalloyed and\r\nwithout exacting retribution for it. And no sooner had I dismissed this\r\nforeboding about some misfortune being about to happen to the state,\r\nthan I met with this calamity in my own household, having during these\r\nholydays had to bury my noble sons, one after the other, who, had they\r\nlived, would alone have borne my name.\r\n\r\n\"Now therefore I fear no further great mischance, and am of good cheer;\r\nfor a sufficient retribution has been exacted from me for my successes,\r\nand the triumpher has been made as notable an example of the uncertainty\r\nof human life as the victim; except that Perseus, though conquered,\r\nstill has his children, while Aemilius, his conqueror, has lost his.\"\r\n\r\nXXXVII. Such was the noble discourse which they say Aemilius from his\r\nsimple and true heart pronounced before the people. As to Perseus,\r\nthough he pitied his fallen fortunes and was most anxious to help him,\r\nall he could do was to get him removed from the common prison, called\r\nCarcer by the Romans, to a clean and habitable lodging, where, in\r\nconfinement, according to most authors, he starved himself to death; but\r\nsome give a strange and extraordinary account of how he died, saying\r\nthat the soldiers who guarded him became angry with him, and not being\r\nable to vex him by any other means, they prevented his going to sleep,\r\nwatching him by turns, and so carefully keeping him from rest by all\r\nmanner of devices, that at last he was worn out and died. Two of his\r\nchildren died also; but the third, Alexander, they say became\r\naccomplished in repoussé work and other arts. He learned to speak and\r\nwrite the Roman language well, and was employed by the magistrates as a\r\nclerk, in which profession he was much esteemed.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. The most popular thing which Aemilius did in connection with\r\nMacedonia was that he brought back so much money that the people were\r\nnot obliged to pay any taxes till the consulship of Hirtius and Pausa,\r\nduring the first war between Antony and Augustus Caesar. This was\r\nremarkable about Aemilius, that he was peculiarly respected and loved by\r\nthe people, though of the aristocratical party; and though he never said\r\nor did anything to make himself popular, but always in politics acted\r\nwith the party of the nobles. Scipio Africanus was afterwards reproached\r\nwith this by Appius. These were the leading men in the city, and were\r\ncandidates for the office of Censor: the one with the Senate and nobles\r\nto support him, that being the hereditary party of the Appii; the other\r\nbeing a man of mark in himself, and one who ever enjoyed the greatest\r\nlove and favour with the people. So when Appius saw Scipio coming into\r\nthe forum surrounded by men of low birth and freed men, yet men who knew\r\nthe forum, and who could collect a mob and by their influence and noise\r\ncould get any measure passed, he called out, \"O Paulus Aemilius, groan\r\nin your grave, at your son being brought into the Censorship by Aemilius\r\nthe crier and Licinius Philonicus.\" But Scipio kept the people in good\r\nhumour by constantly augmenting their privileges, whereas Aemilius,\r\nthough of the aristocratic party, was no less loved by the people than\r\nthose who courted their favour and caressed them. They showed this by\r\nelecting him, amongst other dignities, to the Censorship; which office\r\nis most sacred, and confers great power, especially in examining men's\r\nlives; for the Censor can expel a senator of evil life from his place,\r\nand elect the President of the Senate, and punish licentious young men\r\nby taking away their horses. They also register the value of property,\r\nand the census of the people. In his time they amounted to three hundred\r\nand thirty-seven thousand four hundred and fifty-two. He appointed\r\nMarcus Aemilius Lepidus President of the Senate, who four times already\r\nhad enjoyed that dignity, and he expelled three senators, not men of\r\nmark. With regard to the Equites, he and his colleague Marcius Philippus\r\nshowed equal moderation.\r\n\r\nXXXIX. After most of the labours of his life were accomplished, he fell\r\nsick of a disorder which at first seemed dangerous, but as time went on\r\nappeared not to be mortal, but wearisome and hard to cure.\r\n\r\nAt length he followed the advice of his physicians, and sailed to\r\nPaestum, in Italy. There he passed his time chiefly in the peaceful\r\nmeadows near the sea-shore; but the people of Rome regretted his\r\nabsence, and in the public theatre often would pray for his return, and\r\nspeak of their longing to see him. When the time for some religious\r\nceremony at which he had to be present approached, and he also\r\nconsidered himself sufficiently strong, he returned to Rome. He\r\nperformed the sacrifice, with the other priests, the people surrounding\r\nhim with congratulations. On the next day he again officiated, offering\r\na thank-offering to the gods for his recovery. When this sacrifice was\r\nfinished, he went home and lay down, and before any one noticed how\r\nchanged he was, he fell into a delirious trance, and died in three days,\r\nhaving in his life wanted none of those things which are thought to\r\nrender men happy. Even his funeral procession was admirable and\r\nenviable, and a noble tribute to his valour and goodness. I do not mean\r\ngold, ivory, and other expensive and vain-glorious apparatus, but love,\r\nhonour, and respect, not only shown by his own countrymen, but also by\r\nforeigners. For of the Iberians, Ligurians, and Macedonians who happened\r\nto be in Rome, the strongest carried the bier, while the elder men\r\nfollowed after, praising Aemilius as the saviour and benefactor of their\r\ncountries. For he not only during his period of conquest had treated\r\nthem mildly and humanely, but throughout the rest of his life was always\r\nbestowing benefits upon them as persons peculiarly connected with\r\nhimself. His estate, they say, scarcely amounted to three hundred and\r\nseventy thousand sesterces,[A] which he left to be shared between his\r\ntwo sons; but Scipio, the younger, consented to give up his share to his\r\nbrother, as he was a member of a rich family, that of Africanus. Such is\r\nsaid to have been the life and character of Aemilius Paulus.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Little more than £3000.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF PAULUS AEMILIUS AND TIMOLEON.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The characters of these men being such as is shown in their\r\nhistories, it is evident that in comparing them we shall find few\r\ndifferences and points of variance. Even their wars were in both cases\r\nwaged against notable antagonists, the one with the Macedonians, the\r\nother with the Carthaginians: while their conquests were glorious, as\r\nthe one took Macedonia, and crushed the dynasty of Antigonus in the\r\nperson of its seventh king, while the other drove all the despots from\r\nSicily and set the island free. Unless indeed any one should insinuate\r\nthat Aemilius attacked Perseus when he was in great strength and had\r\nconquered the Romans before, whereas Timoleon fell upon Dionysius when\r\nhe was quite worn out and helpless: though again it might be urged on\r\nbehalf of Timoleon that he overcame many despots and the great power of\r\nCarthage, with an army hastily collected from all sources, not, like\r\nAemilius, commanding men who were inured to war and knew how to obey,\r\nbut making use of disorderly mercenary soldiers who only fought when it\r\npleased them to do so. An equal success, gained with such unequal means,\r\nreflects the greater credit on the general.\r\n\r\nII. Both were just and incorruptible in their conduct: but Aemilius\r\nseems to have had the advantage of the customs and state of feeling\r\namong his countrymen, by which he was trained to integrity, while\r\nTimoleon without any such encouragement acted virtuously, from his own\r\nnature. This is proved by the fact that the Romans of that period were\r\nall submissive to authority, and carried out the traditions of the\r\nstate, respecting the laws and the opinions of their countrymen:\r\nwhereas, except Dion, no Greek leader or general of that time had\r\nanything to do with Sicilian affairs who did not take bribes: though\r\nmany suspected than Dion was meditating making himself king, and that he\r\nhad dreams of an empire like that of Sparta.\r\n\r\nTimaeus tells us that the Syracusans sent away Gylippus in disgrace for\r\nhis insatiable covetousness, and the bribes which they discovered that\r\nhe received when in command. And many writers had dwelt upon the wicked\r\nand treacherous acts which Pharax the Spartan and Kallippus the Athenian\r\ncommitted, when they were endeavouring to make themselves masters of\r\nSicily. Yet, what were they, and what resources had they, that they\r\nconceived such great designs: the one being only a follower of Dionysius\r\nwhen he was banished from Syracuse, the other a captain of mercenaries\r\nunder Dion? But Timoleon, who was sent to the Syracusans as\r\ngeneralissimo at their own request and prayer, did not seek for command,\r\nbut had a right to it. Yet when he received his power as general and\r\nruler from them of their own free will, he voluntarily decided to hold\r\nit only till he should have expelled from Sicily all those who were\r\nreigning despotically. In Aemilius again we must admire this, that he\r\nsubdued so great an empire and yet did not enrich himself by one\r\ndrachma, and never even saw or touched the king's treasures, although he\r\ndistributed much of them in presents to others. And still, I do not say\r\nthat Timoleon is to be blamed for having received a fine house and\r\nestate; for there is no disgrace in receiving it by such means, though\r\nnot to take it is better, and shows almost superhuman virtue, which\r\ncares not to take what is lawfully within its reach. Yet, as the\r\nstrongest bodies are those which can equally well support the extremes\r\nof heat and cold, so the noblest minds are those which prosperity does\r\nnot render insolent and overbearing, nor ill fortune depress: and here\r\nAemilius appears more nearly to approach absolute perfection, as, when\r\nin great misfortune and grief for his children, he showed the same\r\ndignity and firmness as after the greatest success. Whereas Timoleon,\r\nthough he acted towards his brother as became a noble nature, yet could\r\nnot support himself against his sorrow by reason, but was so crushed by\r\nremorse and grief that for twenty years he could not appear or speak in\r\nthe public assembly. We ought indeed to shrink from and feel shame at\r\nwhat is base; but the nature which is over-cautious to avoid blame may\r\nbe gentle and kindly, but cannot be great.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLONDON: PRINTED BY WM.
