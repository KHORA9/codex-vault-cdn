Still]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO REVISED EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLike millions of my race, my mother and father were born slaves, but\r\nwere not contented to live and die so. My father purchased himself in\r\nearly manhood by hard toil. Mother saw no way for herself and children\r\nto escape the horrors of bondage but by flight. Bravely, with her four\r\nlittle ones, with firm faith in God and an ardent desire to be free, she\r\nforsook the prison-house, and succeeded, through the aid of my father,\r\nto reach a free State. Here life had to be begun anew. The old familiar\r\nslave names had to be changed, and others, for prudential reasons, had\r\nto be found. This was not hard work. However, hardly months had passed\r\nere the keen scent of the slave-hunters had trailed them to where they\r\nhad fancied themselves secure. In those days all power was in the hands\r\nof the oppressor, and the capture of a slave mother and her children was\r\nattended with no great difficulty other than the crushing of freedom in\r\nthe breast of the victims. Without judge or jury, all were hurried back\r\nto wear the yoke again. But back this mother was resolved never to stay.\r\nShe only wanted another opportunity to again strike for freedom. In a\r\nfew months after being carried back, with only two of her little ones,\r\nshe took her heart in her hand and her babes in her arms, and this trial\r\nwas a success. Freedom was gained, although not without the sad loss of\r\nher two older children, whom she had to leave behind. Mother and father\r\nwere again reunited in freedom, while two of their little boys were in\r\nslavery. What to do for them other than weep and pray, were questions\r\nunanswerable. For over forty years the mother's heart never knew what it\r\nwas to be free from anxiety about her lost boys. But no tidings came in\r\nanswer to her many prayers, until one of them, to the great astonishment\r\nof his relatives, turned up in Philadelphia, nearly fifty years of age,\r\nseeking his long-lost parents. Being directed to the Anti-Slavery Office\r\nfor instructions as to the best plan to adopt to find out the\r\nwhereabouts of his parents, fortunately he fell into the hands of his\r\nown brother, the writer, whom he had never heard of before, much less\r\nseen or known. And here began revelations connected with this marvellous\r\ncoincidence, which influenced me, for years previous to Emancipation, to\r\npreserve the matter found in the pages of this humble volume.\r\n\r\nAnd in looking back now over these strange and eventful Providences, in\r\nthe light of the wonderful changes wrought by Emancipation, I am more\r\nand more constrained to believe that the reasons, which years ago led me\r\nto aid the bondman and preserve the records of his sufferings, are\r\nto-day quite as potent in convincing me that the necessity of the times\r\nrequires this testimony.\r\n\r\nAnd since the first advent of my book, wherever reviewed or read by\r\nleading friends of freedom, the press, or the race more deeply\r\nrepresented by it, the expressions of approval and encouragement have\r\nbeen hearty and unanimous, and the thousands of volumes which have been\r\nsold by me, on the subscription plan, with hardly any facilities for the\r\nwork, makes it obvious that it would, in the hands of a competent\r\npublisher, have a wide circulation.\r\n\r\nAnd here I may frankly state, that but for the hope I have always\r\ncherished that this work would encourage the race in efforts for\r\nself-elevation, its publication never would have been undertaken by me.\r\n\r\nI believe no more strongly at this moment than I have believed ever\r\nsince the Proclamation of Emancipation was made by Abraham Lincoln, that\r\nas a class, in this country, no small exertion will have to be put forth\r\nbefore the blessings of freedom and knowledge can be fairly enjoyed by\r\nthis people; and until colored men manage by dint of hard acquisition to\r\nenter the ranks of skilled industry, very little substantial respect\r\nwill be shown them, even with the ballot-box and musket in their hands.\r\n\r\nWell-conducted shops and stores; lands acquired and good farms managed\r\nin a manner to compete with any other; valuable books produced and\r\npublished on interesting and important subjects--these are some of the\r\nfruits which the race are expected to exhibit from their newly gained\r\nprivileges.\r\n\r\nIf it is asked \"how?\" I answer, \"through extraordinary determination and\r\nendeavor,\" such as are demonstrated in hundreds of cases in the pages of\r\nthis book, in the struggles of men and women to obtain their freedom,\r\neducation and property.\r\n\r\nThese facts must never be lost sight of.\r\n\r\nThe race must not forget the rock from whence they were hewn, nor the\r\npit from whence, they were digged.\r\n\r\nLike other races, this newly emancipated people will need all the\r\nknowledge of their past condition which they can get.\r\n\r\nThe bondage and deliverance of the children of Israel will never be\r\nallowed to sink into oblivion while the world stands.\r\n\r\nThose scenes of suffering and martyrdom millions of Christians were\r\ncalled upon to pass through in the days of the Inquisition are still\r\nsubjects of study, and have unabated interest for all enlightened minds.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of the history of this country. The struggles of the\r\npioneer fathers are preserved, produced and re-produced, and cherished\r\nwith undying interest by all Americans, and the day will not arrive\r\nwhile the Republic exists, when these histories will not be found in\r\nevery library.\r\n\r\nWhile the grand little army of abolitionists was waging its untiring\r\nwarfare for freedom, prior to the rebellion, no agency encouraged them\r\nlike the heroism of fugitives. The pulse of the four millions of slaves\r\nand their desire for freedom, were better felt through \"The Underground\r\nRailroad,\" than through any other channel.\r\n\r\nFrederick Douglass, Henry Bibb, Wm. Wells Brown, Rev. J.W. Logan, and\r\nothers, gave unmistakable evidence that the race had no more eloquent\r\nadvocates than its own self-emancipated champions.\r\n\r\nEvery step they took to rid themselves of their fetters, or to gain\r\neducation, or in pleading the cause of their fellow-bondmen in the\r\nlecture-room, or with their pens, met with applause on every hand, and\r\nthe very argument needed was thus furnished in large measure. In those\r\ndark days previous to emancipation, such testimony was indispensable.\r\n\r\nThe free colored men are as imperatively required now to furnish the\r\nsame manly testimony in support of the ability of the race to surmount\r\nthe remaining obstacles growing out of oppression, ignorance, and\r\npoverty.\r\n\r\nIn the political struggles, the hopes of the race have been sadly\r\ndisappointed. From this direction no great advantage is likely to arise\r\nvery soon.\r\n\r\nOnly as desert can be proved by the acquisition of knowledge and the\r\nexhibition of high moral character, in examples of economy and a\r\ndisposition to encourage industrial enterprises, conducted by men of\r\ntheir own ranks, will it be possible to make political progress in the\r\nface of the present public sentiment.\r\n\r\nHere, therefore, in my judgment is the best possible reason for\r\nvigorously pushing the circulation of this humble volume--that it may\r\ntestify for thousands and tens of thousands, as no other work can do.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM STILL, Author.\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1878.

Hence, as Seth was a man who seemed wholly\r\ninsensible to fear, and to know no other law of humanity and right, than\r\nwhenever the claims of the suffering and the wronged appealed to him, to\r\nrespond unreservedly, whether those thus injured were amongst his\r\nnearest kin or the greatest strangers,--it mattered not to what race or\r\nclime they might belong,--he, in the spirit of the good Samaritan,\r\nowning all such as his neighbors, volunteered his services, without pay\r\nor reward, to go and rescue the wife and three children of Peter Still.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of this offer can hardly be appreciated. It was literally\r\nlaying his life on the altar of freedom for the despised and oppressed\r\nwhom he had never seen, whose kins-folk even he was not acquainted with.\r\nAt this juncture even Peter was not prepared to accept this proposal. He\r\nwanted to secure the freedom of his wife and children as earnestly as he\r\nhad ever desired to see his mother, yet he could not, at first, hearken\r\nto the idea of having them rescued in the way suggested by Concklin,\r\nfearing a failure.\r\n\r\nTo J.M. McKim and the writer, the bold scheme for the deliverance of\r\nPeter's family was alone confided. It was never submitted to the\r\nVigilance Committee, for the reason, that it was not considered a matter\r\nbelonging thereto. On first reflection, the very idea of such an\r\nundertaking seemed perfectly appalling. Frankly was he told of the great\r\ndangers and difficulties to be encountered through hundreds of miles of\r\nslave territory. Seth was told of those who, in attempting to aid slaves\r\nto escape had fallen victims to the relentless Slave Power, and had\r\neither lost their lives, or been incarcerated for long years in\r\npenitentiaries, where no friendly aid could be afforded them; in short,\r\nhe was plainly told, that without a very great chance, the undertaking\r\nwould cost him his life. The occasion of this interview and\r\nconversation, the seriousness of Concklin and the utter failure in\r\npresenting the various obstacles to his plan, to create the slightest\r\napparent misgiving in his mind, or to produce the slightest sense of\r\nfear or hesitancy, can never be effaced from the memory of the writer.\r\nThe plan was, however, allowed to rest for a time.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, Peter's mind was continually vacillating between\r\nAlabama, with his wife and children, and his new-found relatives in the\r\nNorth. Said a brother, \"If you cannot get your family, what will you do?\r\nWill you come North and live with your relatives?\" \"I would as soon go\r\nout of the world, as not to go back and do all I can for them,\" was the\r\nprompt reply of Peter.\r\n\r\nThe problem of buying them was seriously considered, but here obstacles\r\nquite formidable lay in the way. Alabama laws utterly denied the right\r\nof a slave to buy himself, much less his wife and children. The right of\r\nslave masters to free their slaves, either by sale or emancipation, was\r\npositively prohibited by law. With these reflections weighing upon his\r\nmind, having stayed away from his wife as long as he could content\r\nhimself to do, he took his carpet-bag in his hand, and turned his face\r\ntoward Alabama, to embrace his family in the prison-house of bondage.\r\n\r\nHis approach home could only be made stealthily, not daring to breathe\r\nto a living soul, save his own family, his nominal Jew master, and one\r\nother friend--a slave--where he had been, the prize he had found, or\r\nanything in relation to his travels. To his wife and children his return\r\nwas unspeakably joyous. The situation of his family concerned him with\r\ntenfold more weight than ever before,\r\n\r\nAs the time drew near to make the offer to his wife's master to purchase\r\nher with his children, his heart failed him through fear of awakening\r\nthe ire of slaveholders against him, as he knew that the law and public\r\nsentiment were alike deadly opposed to the spirit of freedom in the\r\nslave. Indeed, as innocent as a step in this direction might appear, in\r\nthose days a man would have stood about as good a chance for his life in\r\nentering a lair of hungry hyenas, as a slave or free colored man would,\r\nin talking about freedom.\r\n\r\nHe concluded, therefore, to say nothing about buying. The plan proposed\r\nby Seth Concklin was told to Vina, his wife; also what he had heard from\r\nhis brother about the Underground Rail Road,--how, that many who could\r\nnot get their freedom in any other way, by being aided a little, were\r\ndaily escaping to Canada. Although the wife and children had never\r\ntasted the pleasures of freedom for a single hour in their lives, they\r\nhated slavery heartily, and being about to be far separated from husband\r\nand father, they were ready to assent to any proposition that looked\r\nlike deliverance.\r\n\r\nSo Peter proposed to Vina, that she should give him certain small\r\narticles, consisting of a cape, etc., which he would carry with him as\r\nmemorials, and, in case Concklin or any one else should ever come for\r\nher from him, as an unmistakable sign that all was right, he would send\r\nback, by whoever was to befriend them, the cape, so that she and the\r\nchildren might not doubt but have faith in the man, when he gave her the\r\nsign, (cape).\r\n\r\nAgain Peter returned to Philadelphia, and was now willing to accept the\r\noffer of Concklin. Ere long, the opportunity of an interview was had,\r\nand Peter gave Seth a very full description of the country and of his\r\nfamily, and made known to him, that he had very carefully gone over with\r\nhis wife and children the matter of their freedom. This interview\r\ninterested Concklin most deeply. If his own wife and children had been\r\nin bondage, scarcely could he have manifested greater sympathy for them.\r\n\r\nFor the hazardous work before him he was at once prepared to make a\r\nstart. True he had two sisters in Philadelphia for whom he had always\r\ncherished the warmest affection, but he conferred not with them on this\r\nmomentous mission. For full well did he know that it was not in human\r\nnature for them to acquiesce in this perilous undertaking, though one of\r\nthese sisters, Mrs. Supplee, was a most faithful abolitionist.\r\n\r\nHaving once laid his hand to the plough he was not the man to look\r\nback,--not even to bid his sisters good-bye, but he actually left them\r\nas though he expected to be home to his dinner as usual. What had become\r\nof him during those many weeks of his perilous labors in Alabama to\r\nrescue this family was to none a greater mystery than to his sisters. On\r\nleaving home he simply took two or three small articles in the way of\r\napparel with one hundred dollars to defray his expenses for a time; this\r\nsum he considered ample to start with. Of course he had very safely\r\nconcealed about him Vina's cape and one or two other articles which he\r\nwas to use for his identification in meeting her and the children on the\r\nplantation.\r\n\r\nHis first thought was, on reaching his destination, after becoming\r\nacquainted with the family, being familiar with Southern manners, to\r\nhave them all prepared at a given hour for the starting of the steamboat\r\nfor Cincinnati, and to join him at the wharf, when he would boldly\r\nassume the part of a slaveholder, and the family naturally that of\r\nslaves, and in this way he hoped to reach Cincinnati direct, before\r\ntheir owner had fairly discovered their escape.\r\n\r\nBut alas for Southern irregularity, two or three days' delay after being\r\nadvertised to start, was no uncommon circumstance with steamers; hence\r\nthis plan was abandoned. What this heroic man endured from severe\r\nstruggles and unyielding exertions, in traveling thousands of miles on\r\nwater and on foot, hungry and fatigued, rowing his living freight for\r\nseven days and seven nights in a skiff, is hardly to be paralleled in\r\nthe annals of the Underground Rail Road.\r\n\r\nThe following interesting letters penned by the hand of Concklin convey\r\nminutely his last struggles and characteristically represent the\r\nsingleness of heart which impelled him to sacrifice his life for the\r\nslave--\r\n\r\nEASTPORT, MISS., FEB. 3, 1851.\r\n\r\nTo Wm. Still:--Our friends in Cincinnati have failed finding anybody to\r\nassist me on my return. Searching the country opposite Paducah, I find\r\nthat the whole country fifty miles round is inhabited only by Christian\r\nwolves. It is customary, when a strange negro is seen, for any white man\r\nto seize the negro and convey such negro through and out of the State of\r\nIllinois to Paducah, Ky., and lodge such stranger in Paducah jail, and\r\nthere claim such reward as may be offered by the master.\r\n\r\nThere is no regularity by the steamboats on the Tennessee River. I was\r\nfour days getting to Florence from Paducah. Sometimes they are four days\r\nstarting, from the time appointed, which alone puts to rest the plan for\r\nreturning by steamboat. The distance from the mouth of the river to\r\nFlorence, is from between three hundred and five to three hundred and\r\nforty-five miles by the river; by land, two hundred and fifty, or more.\r\n\r\nI arrived at the shoe shop on the plantation, one o'clock, Tuesday,\r\n28th. William and two boys were making shoes. I immediately gave the\r\nfirst signal, anxiously waiting thirty minutes for an opportunity to\r\ngive the second and main signal, during which time I was very sociable.\r\nIt was rainy and muddy--my pants were rolled up to the knees. I was in\r\nthe character of a man seeking employment in this country. End of thirty\r\nminutes gave the second signal.\r\n\r\nWilliam appeared unmoved; soon sent out the boys; instantly sociable;\r\nPeter and Levin at the Island; one of the young masters with them; not\r\nsafe to undertake to see them till Saturday night, when they would be at\r\nhome; appointed a place to see Vina, in an open field, that night; they\r\nto bring me something to eat; our interview only four minutes; I left;\r\nappeared by night; dark and cloudy; at ten o'clock appeared William;\r\nexchanged signals; led me a few rods to where stood Vina; gave her the\r\nsignal sent by Peter; our interview ten minutes; she did not call me\r\n\"master,\" nor did she say \"sir,\" by which I knew she had confidence in\r\nme.\r\n\r\nOur situation being dangerous, we decided that I meet Peter and Levin on\r\nthe bank of the river early dawn of day, Sunday, to establish the laws.\r\nDuring our interview, William prostrated on his knees, and face to the\r\nground; arms sprawling; head cocked back, watching for wolves, by which\r\nposition a man can see better in the dark. No house to go to safely,\r\ntraveled round till morning, eating hoe cake which William had given me\r\nfor supper; next day going around to get employment. I thought of\r\nWilliam, who is a Christian preacher, and of the Christian preachers in\r\nPennsylvania. One watching for wolves by night, to rescue Vina and her\r\nthree children from Christian licentiousness; the other standing erect\r\nin open day, seeking the praise of men.\r\n\r\nDuring the four days waiting for the important Sunday morning, I\r\nthoroughly surveyed the rocks and shoals of the river from Florence\r\nseven miles up, where will be my place of departure. General notice was\r\ntaken of me as being a stranger, lurking around. Fortunately there are\r\nseveral small grist mills within ten miles around. No taverns here, as\r\nin the North; any planter's house entertains travelers occasionally.\r\n\r\nOne night I stayed at a medical gentleman's, who is not a large planter;\r\nanother night at an ex-magistrate's house in South Florence--a Virginian\r\nby birth--one of the late census takers; told me that many more persons\r\ncannot read and write than is reported; one fact, amongst many others,\r\nthat many persons who do not know the letters of the alphabet, have\r\nlearned to write their own names; such are generally reported readers\r\nand writers.\r\n\r\nIt being customary for a stranger not to leave the house early in the\r\nmorning where he has lodged, I was under the necessity of staying out\r\nall night Saturday, to be able to meet Peter and Levin, which was\r\naccomplished in due time. When we approached, I gave my signal first;\r\nimmediately they gave theirs. I talked freely. Levin's voice, at first,\r\nevidently trembled. No wonder, for my presence universally attracted\r\nattention by the lords of the land. Our interview was less than one\r\nhour; the laws were written. I to go to Cincinnati to get a rowing boat\r\nand provisions; a first class clipper boat to go with speed. To depart\r\nfrom the place where the laws were written, on Saturday night of the\r\nfirst of March. I to meet one of them at the same place Thursday night,\r\nprevious to the fourth Saturday from the night previous to the Sunday\r\nwhen the laws were written. We to go down the Tennessee river to some\r\nplace up the Ohio, not yet decided on, in our row boat. Peter and Levin\r\nare good oarsmen. So am I. Telegraph station at Tuscumbia, twelve miles\r\nfrom the plantation, also at Paducah.\r\n\r\nCame from Florence to here Sunday night by steamboat. Eastport is in\r\nMississippi. Waiting here for a steamboat to go down; paying one dollar\r\na day for board. Like other taverns here, the wretchedness is\r\nindescribable; no pen, ink, paper or newspaper to be had; only one room\r\nfor everybody, except the gambling rooms. It is difficult for me to\r\nwrite. Vina intends to get a pass for Catharine and herself for the\r\nfirst Sunday in March.\r\n\r\nThe bank of the river where I met Peter and Levin is two miles from the\r\nplantation. I have avoided saying I am from Philadelphia. Also avoided\r\ntalking about negroes. I never talked so much about milling before. I\r\nconsider most of the trouble over, till I arrive in a free State with my\r\ncrew, the first week in March; then will I have to be wiser than\r\nChristian serpents, and more cautious than doves. I do not consider it\r\nsafe to keep this letter in my possession, yet I dare not put it in the\r\npost-office here; there is so little business in these post-offices that\r\nnotice might be taken.\r\n\r\nI am evidently watched; everybody knows me to be a miller. I may write\r\nagain when I get to Cincinnati, if I should have time. The\r\nex-magistrate, with whom I stayed in South Florence, held three hours'\r\ntalk with me, exclusive of our morning talk. Is a man of good general\r\ninformation; he was exceedingly inquisitive. \"I am from Cincinnati,\r\nformerly from the _State of New York_.\" I had no opportunity to get\r\nanything to eat from seven o'clock Tuesday morning till six o'clock\r\nWednesday evening, except the hoe cake, and no sleep.\r\n\r\nFlorence is the head of navigation for small steamboats. Seven miles,\r\nall the way up to my place of departure, is swift water, and rocky.\r\nEight hundred miles to Cincinnati. I found all things here as Peter told\r\nme, except the distance of the river. South Florence contains twenty\r\nwhite families, three warehouses of considerable business, a\r\npost-office, but no school. McKiernon is here waiting for a steamboat to\r\ngo to New Orleans, so we are in company.\r\n\r\nPRINCETON, GIBSON COUNTY, INDIANA, FEB. 18, 1851.\r\n\r\nTo Wm. Still:--The plan is to go to Canada, on the Wabash, opposite\r\nDetroit. There are four routes to Canada. One through Illinois,\r\ncommencing above and below Alton; one through to North Indiana, and the\r\nCincinnati route, being the largest route in the United States.\r\n\r\nI intended to have gone through Pennsylvania, but the risk going up the\r\nOhio river has caused me to go to Canada. Steamboat traveling is\r\nuniversally condemned, though many go in boats, consequently many get\r\nlost. Going in a skiff is new, and is approved of in my case. After I\r\narrive at the mouth of the Tennessee river, I will go up the Ohio\r\nseventy-five miles, to the mouth of the Wabash, then up the Wabash,\r\nforty-four miles to New Harmony, where I shall go ashore by night, and\r\ngo thirteen miles east, to Charles Grier, a farmer, (colored man), who\r\nwill entertain us, and next night convey us sixteen miles to David\r\nStormon, near Princeton, who will take the command, and I be released.\r\n\r\nDavid Stormon estimates the expenses from his house to Canada, at forty\r\ndollars, without which, no sure protection will be given. They might be\r\ninstructed concerning the course, and beg their way through without\r\nmoney. If you wish to do what should be done, you will send me fifty\r\ndollars, in a letter, to Princeton, Gibson county, Inda., so as to\r\narrive there by the 8th of March. Eight days should be estimated for a\r\nletter to arrive from Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe money to be State Bank of Ohio, or State Bank, or Northern Bank of\r\nKentucky, or any other Eastern bank. Send no notes larger than twenty\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nLevi Coffin had no money for me. I paid twenty dollars for the skiff. No\r\nmoney to get back to Philadelphia. It was not understood that I would\r\nhave to be at any expense seeking aid.\r\n\r\nOne half of my time has been used in trying to find persons to assist,\r\nwhen I may arrive on the Ohio river, in which I have failed, except\r\nStormon.\r\n\r\nHaving no letter of introduction to Stormon from any source, on which I\r\ncould fully rely, I traveled two hundred miles around, to find out his\r\nstability. I have found many Abolitionists, nearly all who have made\r\npropositions, which themselves would not comply with, and nobody else\r\nwould. Already I have traveled over three thousand miles. Two thousand\r\nand four hundred by steamboat, two hundred by railroad, one hundred by\r\nstage, four hundred on foot, forty-eight in a skiff.\r\n\r\nI have yet five hundred miles to go to the plantation, to commence\r\noperations. I have been two weeks on the decks of steamboats, three\r\nnights out, two of which I got perfectly wet. If I had had paper money,\r\nas McKim desired, it would have been destroyed. I have not been\r\nentertained gratis at any place except Stormon's. I had one hundred and\r\ntwenty-six dollars when I left Philadelphia, one hundred from you,\r\ntwenty-six mine.\r\n\r\nTelegraphed to station at Evansville, thirty-three miles from Stormon's,\r\nand at Vinclure's, twenty-five miles from Stormon's. The Wabash route is\r\nconsidered the safest route. No one has ever been lost from Stormon's to\r\nCanada. Some have been lost between Stormon's and the Ohio. The wolves\r\nhave never suspected Stormon. Your asking aid in money for a case\r\nproperly belonging east of Ohio, is detested. If you have sent money to\r\nCincinnati, you should recall it. I will have no opportunity to use it.\r\n\r\nSeth Concklin, Princeton, Gibson county, Ind.\r\n\r\nP.S. First of April, will be about the time Peter's family will arrive\r\nopposite Detroit. You should inform yourself how to find them there. I\r\nmay have no opportunity.\r\n\r\nI will look promptly for your letter at Princeton, till the 10th of\r\nMarch, and longer if there should have been any delay by the mails.\r\n\r\nIn March, as contemplated, Concklin arrived in Indiana, at the place\r\ndesignated, with Peter's wife and three children, and sent a thrilling\r\nletter to the writer, portraying in the most vivid light his adventurous\r\nflight from the hour they left Alabama until their arrival in Indiana.\r\nIn this report he stated, that instead of starting early in the morning,\r\nowing to some unforeseen delay on the part of the family, they did not\r\nreach the designated place till towards day, which greatly exposed them\r\nin passing a certain town which he had hoped to avoid.\r\n\r\nBut as his brave heart was bent on prosecuting his journey without\r\nfurther delay, he concluded to start at all hazards, notwithstanding the\r\ndangers he apprehended from passing said town by daylight. For safety he\r\nendeavored to hide his freight by having them all lie flat down on the\r\nbottom of the skiff; covered them with blankets, concealing them from\r\nthe effulgent beams of the early morning sun, or rather from the\r\n\"Christian Wolves\" who might perchance espy him from the shore in\r\npassing the town.\r\n\r\nThe wind blew fearfully. Concklin was rowing heroically when loud voices\r\nfrom the shore hailed him, but he was utterly deaf to the sound.\r\nImmediately one or two guns were fired in the direction of the skiff,\r\nbut he heeded not this significant call; consequently here ended this\r\ndifficulty. He supposed, as the wind was blowing so hard, those on shore\r\nwho hailed him must have concluded that he did not hear them and that he\r\nmeant no disrespect in treating them with seeming indifference. Whilst\r\nmany straits and great dangers had to be passed, this was the greatest\r\nbefore reaching their destination.\r\n\r\nBut suffice it to say that the glad tidings which this letter contained\r\nfilled the breast of Peter with unutterable delight and his friends and\r\nrelations with wonder beyond degree.[A] No fond wife had ever waited\r\nwith more longing desire for the return of her husband than Peter had\r\nfor this blessed news. All doubts had disappeared, and a well grounded\r\nhope was cherished that within a few short days Peter and his fond wife\r\nand children would be reunited in Freedom on the Canada side, and that\r\nConcklin and the friends would be rejoicing with joy unspeakable over\r\nthis great triumph. But alas, before the few days had expired the\r\nsubjoined brief paragraph of news was discovered in the morning Ledger.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: In some unaccountable manner this the last letter Concklin\r\never penned, perhaps, has been unfortunately lost.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    RUNAWAY NEGROES CAUGHT.--At Vincennes, Indiana, on Saturday\r\n    last, a white man and four negroes were arrested. The negroes\r\n    belong to B. McKiernon, of South Florence, Alabama, and the man\r\n    who was running them off calls himself John H. Miller. The\r\n    prisoners were taken charge of by the Marshall of\r\n    Evansville.--_April 9th_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow suddenly these sad tidings turned into mourning and gloom the hope\r\nand joy of Peter and his relatives no pen could possibly describe; at\r\nleast the writer will not attempt it here, but will at once introduce a\r\nwitness who met the noble Concklin and the panting fugitives in Indiana\r\nand proffered them sympathy and advice. And it may safely be said from a\r\ntruer and more devoted friend of the slave they could not have received\r\ncounsel.\r\n\r\n\r\n    EVANSVILLE, INDIANA, MARCH 31st, 1851.\r\n\r\n    WM. STILL: _Dear Sir_ ,--On last Tuesday I mailed a letter to\r\n    you, written by Seth Concklin. I presume you have received that\r\n    letter. It gave an account of his rescue of the family of your\r\n    brother. If that is the last news you have had from them, I have\r\n    very painful intelligence for you. They passed on from near\r\n    Princeton, where I saw them and had a lengthy interview with\r\n    them, up north, I think twenty-three miles above Vincennes,\r\n    Ind., where they were seized by a party of men, and lodged in\r\n    jail. Telegraphic dispatches were sent all through the South. I\r\n    have since learned that the Marshall of Evansville received a\r\n    dispatch from Tuscumbia, to look out for them. By some means, he\r\n    and the master, so says report, went to Vincennes and claimed\r\n    the fugitives, chained Mr. Concklin and hurried all off. Mr.\r\n    Concklin wrote to Mr. David Stormon, Princeton, as soon as he\r\n    was cast into prison, to find bail. So soon as we got the letter\r\n    and could get off, two of us were about setting off to render\r\n    all possible aid, when we were told they all had passed, a few\r\n    hours before, through Princeton, Mr. Concklin in chains. What\r\n    kind of process was had, if any, I know not. I immediately came\r\n    down to this place, and learned that they had been put on a boat\r\n    at 3 P.M. I did not arrive until 6. Now all hopes of their\r\n    recovery are gone. No case ever so enlisted my sympathies. I had\r\n    seen Mr. Concklin in Cincinnati. I had given him aid and\r\n    counsel. I happened to see them after they landed in Indiana. I\r\n    heard Peter and Levin tell their tale of suffering, shed tears\r\n    of sorrow for them all; but now, since they have fallen a prey\r\n    to the unmerciful blood-hounds of this state, and have again\r\n    been dragged back to unrelenting bondage, I am entirely\r\n    unmanned. And poor Concklin! I fear for him. When he is dragged\r\n    back to Alabama, I fear they will go far beyond the utmost rigor\r\n    of the law, and vent their savage cruelty upon him. It is with\r\n    pain I have to communicate these things. But you may not hear\r\n    them from him. I could not get to see him or them, as Vincennes\r\n    is about thirty miles from Princeton, where I was when I heard\r\n    of the capture.\r\n\r\n    I take pleasure in stating that, according to the letter he\r\n    (Concklin) wrote to Mr. D. Stewart, Mr. Concklin did not abandon\r\n    them, but risked his own liberty to save them. He was not with\r\n    them when they were taken; but went afterwards to take them out\r\n    of jail upon a writ of Habeas Corpus, when they seized him too\r\n    and lodged him in prison.\r\n\r\n    I write in much haste. If I can learn any more facts of\r\n    importance, I may write you. If you desire to hear from me\r\n    again, or if you should learn any thing specific from Mr.\r\n    Concklin, be pleased to write me at Cincinnati, where I expect\r\n    to be in a short time. If curious to know your correspondent, I\r\n    may say I was formerly Editor of the \"New Concord Free Press,\"\r\n    Ohio. I only add that every case of this kind only tends to make\r\n    me abhor my (no!) _this_ country more and more. It is the\r\n    Devil's Government, and God will destroy it.\r\n\r\n    Yours for the slave, N.R. JOHNSTON.\r\n\r\n    P.S. I broke open this letter to write you some more. The\r\n    foregoing pages were written at night. I expected to mail it\r\n    next morning before leaving Evansville; but the boat for which I\r\n    was waiting came down about three in the morning; so I had to\r\n    hurry on board, bringing the letter along. As it now is I am not\r\n    sorry, for coming down, on my way to St. Louis, as far as\r\n    Paducah, there I learned from a colored man at the wharf that,\r\n    that same day, in the morning, the master and the family of\r\n    fugitives arrived off the boat, and had then gone on their\r\n    journey to Tuscumbia, but that the \"white man\" (Mr. Concklin)\r\n    had \"got away from them,\" about twelve miles up the river. It\r\n    seems he got off the boat some way, near or at Smithland, Ky., a\r\n    town at the mouth of the Cumberland River. I presume the report\r\n    is true, and hope he will finally escape, though I was also told\r\n    that they were in pursuit of him. Would that the others had also\r\n    escaped. Peter and Levin could have done so, I think, if they\r\n    had had resolution. One of them rode a horse, he not tied\r\n    either, behind the coach in which the others were. He followed\r\n    apparently \"contented and happy.\" From report, they told their\r\n    master, and even their pursuers, before the master came, that\r\n    Concklin had decoyed them away, they coming unwillingly. I write\r\n    on a very unsteady boat.\r\n\r\n    Yours, N.R. JOHNSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nA report found its way into the papers to the effect that \"Miller,\" the\r\nwhite man arrested in connection with the capture of the family, was\r\nfound drowned, with his hands and feet in chains and his skull\r\nfractured. It proved, as his friends feared, to be Seth Concklin. And in\r\nirons, upon the river bank, there is no doubt he was buried.\r\n\r\nIn this dreadful hour one sad duty still remained to be performed. Up to\r\nthis moment the two sisters were totally ignorant of their brother's\r\nwhereabouts. Not the first whisper of his death had reached them. But\r\nthey must now be made acquainted with all the facts in the case.\r\nAccordingly an interview was arranged for a meeting, and the duty of\r\nconveying this painful intelligence to one of the sisters, Mrs. Supplee,\r\ndevolved upon Mr. McKim. And most tenderly and considerately did he\r\nperform his mournful task.\r\n\r\nAlthough a woman of nerve, and a true friend to the slave, an earnest\r\nworker and a liberal giver in the Female Anti-Slavery Society, for a\r\ntime she was overwhelmed by the intelligence of her brother's death. As\r\nsoon as possible, however, through very great effort, she controlled her\r\nemotions, and calmly expressed herself as being fully resigned to the\r\nawful event. Not a word of complaint had she to make because she had not\r\nbeen apprised of his movements; but said repeatedly, that, had she known\r\never so much of his intentions, she would have been totally powerless in\r\nopposing him if she had felt so disposed, and as an illustration of the\r\ntrue character of the man, from his boyhood up to the day he died for\r\nhis fellow-man, she related his eventful career, and recalled a number\r\nof instances of his heroic and daring deeds for others, sacrificing his\r\ntime and often periling his life in the cause of those who he considered\r\nwere suffering gross wrongs and oppression. Hence, she concluded, that\r\nit was only natural for him in this case to have taken the steps he did.\r\nNow and then overflowing tears would obstruct this deeply thrilling and\r\nmost remarkable story she was telling of her brother, but her memory\r\nseemed quickened by the sadness of the occasion, and she was enabled to\r\nrecall vividly the chief events connected with his past history. Thus\r\nhis agency in this movement, which cost him his life, could readily\r\nenough be accounted for, and the individuals who listened attentively to\r\nthe story were prepared to fully appreciate his character, for, prior to\r\noffering his services in this mission, he had been a stranger to them.\r\n\r\nThe following extract, taken from a letter of a subsequent date, in\r\naddition to the above letter, throws still further light upon the\r\nheart-rending affair, and shows Mr. Johnston's deep sympathy with the\r\nsufferers and the oppressed generally--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM REV. N.R. JOHNSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    My heart bleeds when I think of those poor, hunted and\r\n    heart-broken fugitives, though a most interesting family, taken\r\n    back to bondage ten-fold worse than Egyptian. And then poor\r\n    Concklin! How my heart expanded in love to him, as he told me\r\n    his adventures, his trials, his toils, his fears and his hopes!\r\n    After hearing all, and then seeing and communing with the\r\n    family, now joyful in hopes of soon seeing their husband and\r\n    father in the land of freedom; now in terror lest the human\r\n    blood-hounds should be at their heels, I felt as though I could\r\n    lay down my life in the cause of the oppressed. In that hour or\r\n    two of intercourse with Peter's family, my heart warmed with\r\n    love to them. I never saw more interesting young men. They would\r\n    make Remonds or Douglasses, if they had the same opportunities.\r\n\r\n    While I was with them, I was elated with joy at their escape,\r\n    and yet, when I heard their tale of woe, especially that of the\r\n    mother, I could not suppress tears of deepest emotion.\r\n\r\n    My joy was short-lived. Soon I heard of their capture. The\r\n    telegraph had been the means of their being claimed. I could\r\n    have torn down all the telegraph wires in the land. It was a\r\n    strange dispensation of Providence.\r\n\r\n    On Saturday the sad news of their capture came to my ears. We\r\n    had resolved to go to their aid on Monday, as the trial was set\r\n    for Thursday. On Sabbath, I spoke from Psalm xii. 5. \"For the\r\n    oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I\r\n    arise,\" saith the Lord: \"I will set him in safety from him that\r\n    puffeth at (from them that would enslave) him.\" When on Monday\r\n    morning I learned that the fugitives had passed through the\r\n    place on Sabbath, and Concklin in chains, probably at the very\r\n    time I was speaking on the subject referred to, my heart sank\r\n    within me. And even yet, I cannot but exclaim, when I think of\r\n    it--O, Father! how long ere Thou wilt arise to avenge the wrongs\r\n    of the poor slave! Indeed, my dear brother, His ways are very\r\n    mysterious. We have the consolation, however, to know that all\r\n    is for the best. Our Redeemer does all things well. When He hung\r\n    upon the cross, His poor broken hearted disciples could not\r\n    understand the providence; it was a dark time to them; and yet\r\n    that was an event that was fraught with more joy to the world\r\n    than any that has occurred or could occur. Let us stand at our\r\n    post and wait God's time. Let us have on the whole armor of God,\r\n    and fight for the right, knowing, that though we may fall in\r\n    battle, the victory will be ours, sooner or later.\r\n\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n    May God lead you into all truth, and sustain you in your labors,\r\n    and fulfill your prayers and hopes. Adieu.\r\n\r\n    N.R. JOHNSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS FROM LEVI COFFIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following letters on the subject were received from the untiring and\r\ndevoted friend of the slave, Levi Coffin, who for many years had\r\noccupied in Cincinnati a similar position to that of Thomas Garrett in\r\nDelaware, a sentinel and watchman commissioned of God to succor the\r\nfleeing bondman--\r\n\r\n\r\n    CINCINNATI, 4TH MO., 10TH, 1851.\r\n\r\n    FRIEND WM. STILL:--We have sorrowful news from our friend\r\n    Concklin, through the papers and otherwise. I received a letter\r\n    a few days ago from a friend near Princeton, Ind., stating that\r\n    Concklin and the four slaves are in prison in Vincennes, and\r\n    that their trial would come on in a few days. He states that\r\n    they rowed seven days and nights in the skiff, and got safe to\r\n    Harmony, Ind., on the Wabash river, thence to Princeton, and\r\n    were conveyed to Vincennes by friends, where they were taken.\r\n    The papers state, that they were all given up to the Marshal of\r\n    Evansville, Indiana.\r\n\r\n    We have telegraphed to different points, to try to get some\r\n    information concerning them, but failed. The last information is\r\n    published in the _Times_ of yesterday, though quite incorrect in\r\n    the particulars of the case. Inclosed is the slip containing it.\r\n    I fear all is over in regard to the freedom of the slaves. If\r\n    the last account be true, we have some hope that Concklin will\r\n    escape from those bloody tyrants. I cannot describe my feelings\r\n    on hearing this sad intelligence. I feel ashamed to own my\r\n    country. Oh! what shall I say. Surely a God of justice will\r\n    avenge the wrongs of the oppressed.\r\n\r\n    Thine for the poor slave,\r\n\r\n    LEVI COFFIN.\r\n\r\n    N.B.--If thou hast any information, please write me forthwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    CINCINNATI, 5TH MO., 11TH, 1851.\r\n\r\n    WM. STILL:--_Dear Friend_--Thy letter of 1st inst., came duly to\r\n    hand, but not being able to give any further information\r\n    concerning our friend, Concklin, I thought best to wait a little\r\n    before I wrote, still hoping to learn something more definite\r\n    concerning him.\r\n\r\n    We that became acquainted with Seth Concklin and his hazardous\r\n    enterprises (here at Cincinnati), who were very few, have felt\r\n    intense and inexpressible anxiety about them. And particularly\r\n    about poor Seth, since we heard of his falling into the hands of\r\n    the tyrants. I fear that he has fallen a victim to their inhuman\r\n    thirst for blood.\r\n\r\n    I seriously doubt the rumor, that he had made his escape. I fear\r\n    that he was sacrificed.\r\n\r\n    Language would fail to express my feelings; the intense and deep\r\n    anxiety I felt about them for weeks before I heard of their\r\n    capture in Indiana, and then it seemed too much to bear. O! my\r\n    heart almost bleeds when I think of it. The hopes of the dear\r\n    family all blasted by the wretched blood-hounds in human shape.\r\n    And poor Seth, after all his toil, and dangerous, shrewd and\r\n    wise management, and almost unheard of adventures, the many\r\n    narrow and almost miraculous escapes. Then to be given up to\r\n    Indianians, to these fiendish tyrants, to be sacrificed. O!\r\n    Shame, Shame!!\r\n\r\n    My heart aches, my eyes fill with tears, I cannot write more. I\r\n    cannot dwell longer on this painful subject now. If you get any\r\n    intelligence, please inform me. Friend N.R. Johnston, who took\r\n    so much interest in them, and saw them just before they were\r\n    taken, has just returned to the city. He is a minister of the\r\n    Covenanter order. He is truly a lovely man, and his heart is\r\n    full of the milk of humanity; one of our best Anti-Slavery\r\n    spirits. I spent last evening with him. He related the whole\r\n    story to me as he had it from friend Concklin and the mother and\r\n    children, and then the story of their capture. We wept together.\r\n    He found thy letter when he got here.\r\n\r\n    He said he would write the whole history to thee in a few days,\r\n    as far as he could. He can tell it much better than I can.\r\n\r\n    Concklin left his carpet sack and clothes here with me, except a\r\n    shirt or two he took with him. What shall I do with them? For if\r\n    we do not hear from him soon, we must conclude that he is lost,\r\n    and the report of his escape all a hoax.\r\n\r\n    Truly thy friend,\r\n\r\n    LEVI COFFIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nStunning and discouraging as this horrible ending was to all concerned,\r\nand serious as the matter looked in the eyes of Peter's friends with\r\nregard to Peter's family, he could not for a moment abandon the idea of\r\nrescuing them from the jaws of the destroyer. But most formidable\r\ndifficulties stood in the way of opening correspondence with reliable\r\npersons in Alabama. Indeed it seemed impossible to find a merchant,\r\nlawyer, doctor, planter or minister, who was not too completely\r\ninterlinked with slavery to be relied upon to manage a negotiation of\r\nthis nature. Whilst waiting and hoping for something favorable to turn\r\nup, the subjoined letter from the owner of Peter's family was received\r\nand is here inserted precisely as it was written, spelled and\r\npunctuated--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMcKIERNON'S LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    SOUTH FLORENCE ALA 6 Augest 1851\r\n\r\n    Mr WILLIAM STILL _No 31 North Fifth street Philadelphia_\r\n\r\n    Sir a few days sinc mr Lewis Tharenton of Tuscumbia Ala shewed\r\n    me a letter dated 6 June 51 from Cincinnati signd samuel Lewis\r\n    in behalf of a Negro man by the name of peter Gist who informed\r\n    the writer of the Letter that you ware his brother and wished an\r\n    answer to be directed to you as he peter would be in\r\n    philadelphi. the object of the letter was to purchis from me 4\r\n    Negros that is peters wife & 3 children 2 sons & 1 Girl the Name\r\n    of said Negres are the woman Viney the (mother) Eldest son peter\r\n    21 or 2 years old second son Leven 19 or 20 years 1 Girl about\r\n    13 or 14 years old. the Husband & Father of these people once\r\n    Belonged to a relation of mine by the name of Gist now Decest &\r\n    some few years since he peter was sold to a man by the Name of\r\n    Freedman who removed to cincinnati ohio & Tuck peter with him of\r\n    course peter became free by the volentary act of the master some\r\n    time last march a white man by the name of Miller apperd in the\r\n    nabourhood & abducted the bove negroes was caut at vincanes Indi\r\n    with said negroes & was thare convicted of steling & remanded\r\n    back to Ala to Abide the penalty of the law & on his return met\r\n    his Just reward by Getting drownded at the mouth of cumberland\r\n    River on the ohio in attempting to make his escape I recovered &\r\n    Braught Back said 4 negroes or as You would say coulard people\r\n    under the Belief that peter the Husband was accessory to the\r\n    offence thareby putting me to much Expense & Truble to the amt\r\n    $1000 which if he gets them he or his Friends must refund these\r\n    4 negroes are worth in the market about 4000 for thea are\r\n    Extraordinary fine & likely & but for the fact of Elopement I\r\n    would not take 8000 Dollars for them but as the thing now stands\r\n    you can say to peter & his new discovered Relations in\r\n    Philadelphia I will take 5000 for the 4 culerd people & if this\r\n    will suite him & he can raise the money I will delever to him or\r\n    his agent at paduca at mouth of Tennessee river said negroes but\r\n    the money must be Deposeted in the Hands of some respectabl\r\n    person at paduca before I remove the property it wold not be\r\n    safe for peter to come to this countery write me a line on recpt\r\n    of this & let me Know peters views on the above\r\n\r\n    I am Yours &c B.

STILL'S ANSWER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 16th, 1851.\r\n\r\n    To B. McKIERNON, ESQ.: _Sir_--I have received your letter from\r\n    South Florence, Ala., under date of the 6th inst. To say that it\r\n    took me by surprise, as well as afforded me pleasure, for which\r\n    I feel to be very much indebted to you, is no more than true. In\r\n    regard to your informants of myself--Mr. Thornton, of Ala., and\r\n    Mr. Samuel Lewis, of Cincinnati--to them both I am a stranger.\r\n    However, I am the brother of Peter, referred to, and with the\r\n    fact of his having a wife and three children in your service I\r\n    am also familiar. This brother, Peter, I have only had the\r\n    pleasure of knowing for the brief space of one year and thirteen\r\n    days, although he is now past forty and I twenty-nine years of\r\n    age. Time will not allow me at present, or I should give you a\r\n    detailed account of how Peter became a slave, the forty long\r\n    years which intervened between the time he was kidnapped, when a\r\n    boy, being only six years of age, and his arrival in this city,\r\n    from Alabama, one year and fourteen days ago, when he was\r\n    re-united to his mother, five brothers and three sisters.\r\n\r\n    None but a father's heart can fathom the anguish and sorrows\r\n    felt by Peter during the many vicissitudes through which he has\r\n    passed. He looked back to his boyhood and saw himself snatched\r\n    from the tender embraces of his parents and home to be made a\r\n    slave for life.\r\n\r\n    During all his prime days he was in the faithful and constant\r\n    service of those who had no just claim upon him. In the\r\n    meanwhile he married a wife, who bore him eleven children, the\r\n    greater part of whom were emancipated from the troubles of life\r\n    by death, and three only survived. To them and his wife he was\r\n    devoted. Indeed I have never seen attachment between parents and\r\n    children, or husband and wife, more entire than was manifested\r\n    in the case of Peter.\r\n\r\n    Through these many years of servitude, Peter was sold and\r\n    resold, from one State to another, from one owner to another,\r\n    till he reached the forty-ninth year of his age, when, in a good\r\n    Providence, through the kindness of a friend and the sweat of\r\n    his brow, he regained the God-given blessings of liberty. He\r\n    eagerly sought his parents and home with all possible speed and\r\n    pains, when, to his heart's joy, he found his relatives.\r\n\r\n    Your present humble correspondent is the youngest of Peter's\r\n    brothers, and the first one of the family he saw after arriving\r\n    in this part of the country. I think you could not fail to be\r\n    interested in hearing how we became known to each other, and the\r\n    proof of our being brothers, etc., all of which I should be most\r\n    glad to relate, but time will not permit me to do so. The news\r\n    of this wonderful occurrence, of Peter finding his kindred, was\r\n    published quite extensively, shortly afterwards, in various\r\n    newspapers, in this quarter, which may account for the fact of\r\n    \"Miller's\" knowledge of the whereabouts of the \"fugitives.\" Let\r\n    me say, it is my firm conviction that no one had any hand in\r\n    persuading \"Miller\" to go down from Cincinnati, or any other\r\n    place, after the family. As glad as I should be, and as much as\r\n    I would do for the liberation of Peter's family (now no longer\r\n    young), and his three \"likely\" children, in whom he prides\r\n    himself--how much, if you are a father, you can imagine; yet I\r\n    would not, and could not, think of persuading any friend to\r\n    peril his life, as would be the case, in an errand of that kind.\r\n\r\n    As regards the price fixed upon by you for the family, I must\r\n    say I do not think it possible to raise half that amount, though\r\n    Peter authorized me to say he would give you twenty-five hundred\r\n    for them. Probably he is not as well aware as I am, how\r\n    difficult it is to raise so large a sum of money from the\r\n    public. The applications for such objects are so frequent among\r\n    us in the North, and have always been so liberally met, that it\r\n    is no wonder if many get tired of being called upon. To be sure\r\n    some of us brothers own some property, but no great amount;\r\n    certainly not enough to enable us to bear so great a burden.\r\n    Mother owns a small farm in New Jersey, on which she has lived\r\n    for nearly forty years, from which she derives her support in\r\n    her old age. This small farm contains between forty and fifty\r\n    acres, and is the fruit of my father's toil. Two of my brothers\r\n    own small places also, but they have young families, and\r\n    consequently consume nearly as much as they make, with the\r\n    exception of adding some improvements to their places.\r\n\r\n    For my own part, I am employed as a clerk for a living, but my\r\n    salary is quite too limited to enable me to contribute any great\r\n    amount towards so large a sum as is demanded. Thus you see how\r\n    we are situated financially. We have plenty of friends, but\r\n    little money. Now, sir, allow me to make an appeal to your\r\n    humanity, although we are aware of your power to hold as\r\n    property those poor slaves, mother, daughter and two sons,--that\r\n    in no part of the United States could they escape and be secure\r\n    from your claim--nevertheless, would your understanding, your\r\n    heart, or your conscience reprove you, should you restore to\r\n    them, without price, that dear freedom, which is theirs by right\r\n    of nature, or would you not feel a satisfaction in so doing\r\n    which all the wealth of the world could not equal? At all\r\n    events, could you not so reduce the price as to place it in the\r\n    power of Peter's relatives and friends to raise the means for\r\n    their purchase? At first, I doubt not, but that you will think\r\n    my appeal very unreasonable; but, sir, serious reflection will\r\n    decide, whether the money demanded by you, after all, will be of\r\n    as great a benefit to you, as the satisfaction you would find in\r\n    bestowing so great a favor upon those whose entire happiness in\r\n    this life depends mainly upon your decision in the matter. If\r\n    the entire family cannot be purchased or freed, what can Vina\r\n    and her daughter be purchased for? Hoping, sir, to hear from\r\n    you, at your earliest convenience, I subscribe myself,\r\n\r\n    Your obedient servant, WM. STILL.\r\n\r\n    To B. McKiernon, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo reply to this letter was ever received from McKiernon. The cause of\r\nhis reticence can be as well conjectured by the reader as the writer.\r\n\r\nTime will not admit of further details kindred to this narrative. The\r\nlife, struggles, and success of Peter and his family were ably brought\r\nbefore the public in the \"Kidnapped and the Ransomed,\" being the\r\npersonal recollections of Peter Still and his wife \"Vina,\" after forty\r\nyears of slavery, by Mrs. Kate E.R. Pickard; with an introduction by\r\nRev. Samuel J. May, and an appendix by William H. Furness, D.D., in\r\n1856. But, of course it was not prudent or safe, in the days of Slavery,\r\nto publish such facts as are now brought to light; all such had to be\r\nkept concealed in the breasts of the fugitives and their friends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PETER STILL ]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARITY STILL ]\r\n\r\nThe following brief sketch, touching the separation of Peter and his\r\nmother, will fitly illustrate this point, and at the same time explain\r\ncertain mysteries which have been hitherto kept hidden--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEPARATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to Peter's separation from his mother, when a little boy, in\r\nfew words, the facts were these: His parents, Levin and Sidney, were\r\nboth slaves on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. \"I will die before I\r\nsubmit to the yoke,\" was the declaration of his father to his young\r\nmaster before either was twenty-one years of age. Consequently he was\r\nallowed to buy himself at a very low figure, and he paid the required\r\nsum and obtained his \"free papers\" when quite a young man--the young\r\nwife and mother remaining in slavery under Saunders Griffin, as also her\r\nchildren, the latter having increased to the number of four, two little\r\nboys and two little girls. But to escape from chains, stripes, and\r\nbondage, she took her four little children and fled to a place near\r\nGreenwich, New Jersey. Not a great while, however, did she remain there\r\nin a state of freedom before the slave-hunters pursued her, and one\r\nnight they pounced upon the whole family, and, without judge or jury,\r\nhurried them all back to slavery. Whether this was kidnapping or not is\r\nfor the reader to decide for himself.\r\n\r\nSafe back in the hands of her owner, to prevent her from escaping a\r\nsecond time, every night for about three months she was cautiously \"kept\r\nlocked up in the garret,\" until, as they supposed, she was fully \"cured\r\nof the desire to do so again.\" But she was incurable. She had been a\r\nwitness to the fact that her own father's brains had been blown out by\r\nthe discharge of a heavily loaded gun, deliberately aimed at his head by\r\nhis drunken master. She only needed half a chance to make still greater\r\nstruggles than ever for freedom.\r\n\r\nShe had great faith in God, and found much solace in singing some of the\r\ngood old Methodist tunes, by day and night. Her owner, observing this\r\napparently tranquil state of mind, indicating that she \"seemed better\r\ncontented than ever,\" concluded that it was safe to let the garret door\r\nremain unlocked at night. Not many weeks were allowed to pass before she\r\nresolved to again make a bold strike for freedom. This time she had to\r\nleave the two little boys, Levin and Peter, behind.\r\n\r\nOn the night she started she went to the bed where they were sleeping,\r\nkissed them, and, consigning them into the hands of God, bade her mother\r\ngood-bye, and with her two little girls wended her way again to\r\nBurlington County, New Jersey, but to a different neighborhood from that\r\nwhere she had been seized. She changed her name to Charity, and\r\nsucceeded in again joining her husband, but, alas, with the\r\nheart-breaking thought that she had been compelled to leave her two\r\nlittle boys in slavery and one of the little girls on the road for the\r\nfather to go back after. Thus she began life in freedom anew.\r\n\r\nLevin and Peter, eight and six years of age respectively, were now left\r\nat the mercy of the enraged owner, and were soon hurried off to a\r\nSouthern market and sold, while their mother, for whom they were daily\r\nweeping, was they knew not where. They were too young to know that they\r\nwere slaves, or to understand the nature of the afflicting separation.\r\nSixteen years before Peter's return, his older brother (Levin) died a\r\nslave in the State of Alabama, and was buried by his surviving brother,\r\nPeter.\r\n\r\nNo idea other than that they had been \"kidnapped\" from their mother ever\r\nentered their minds; nor had they any knowledge of the State from whence\r\nthey supposed they had been taken, the last names of their mother and\r\nfather, or where they were born. On the other hand, the mother was aware\r\nthat the safety of herself and her rescued children depended on keeping\r\nthe whole transaction a strict family secret. During the forty years of\r\nseparation, except two or three Quaker friends, including the devoted\r\nfriend of the slave, Benjamin Lundy, it is doubtful whether any other\r\nindividuals were let into the secret of her slave life. And when the\r\naccount given of Peter's return, etc., was published in 1850, it led\r\nsome of the family to apprehend serious danger from the partial\r\nrevelation of the early condition of the mother, especially as it was\r\nabout the time that the Fugitive Slave law was passed.\r\n\r\nHence, the author of \"The Kidnapped and the Ransomed\" was compelled to\r\nomit these dangerous facts, and had to confine herself strictly to the\r\n\"personal recollections of Peter Still\" with regard to his being\r\n\"kidnapped.\" Likewise, in the sketch of Seth Concklin's eventful life,\r\nwritten by Dr. W.H. Furness, for similar reasons he felt obliged to make\r\nbut bare reference to his wonderful agency in relation to Peter's\r\nfamily, although he was fully aware of all the facts in the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD LETTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are introduced a few out of a very large number of interesting\r\nletters, designed for other parts of the book as occasion may require.\r\nAll letters will be given precisely as they were written by their\r\nrespective authors, so that there may be no apparent room for charging\r\nthe writer with partial colorings in any instance.

DEPOT).\r\n\r\n\r\nWILMINGTON, 3mo. 23d, 1856.\r\n\r\nDEAR FRIEND, WILLIAM STILL:--Since I wrote thee this morning informing\r\nthee of the safe arrival of the Eight from Norfolk, Harry Craige has\r\ninformed me, that he has a man from Delaware that he proposes to take\r\nalong, who arrived since noon. He will take the man, woman and two\r\nchildren from here with him, and the four men will get in at Marcus\r\nHook. Thee may take Harry Craige by the hand as a brother, true to the\r\ncause; he is one of our most efficient aids on the Rail Road, and worthy\r\nof full confidence. May they all be favored to get on safe. The woman\r\nand three children are no common stock. I assure thee finer specimens of\r\nhumanity are seldom met with. I hope herself and children may be enabled\r\nto find her husband, who has been absent some years, and the rest of\r\ntheir days be happy together.\r\n\r\nI am, as ever, thy friend,\r\n\r\nTHOS. GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM MISS G.A. LEWIS (U.G.R.R. DEPOT).\r\n\r\n\r\nKIMBERTON, October 28th, 1855.\r\n\r\nESTEEMED FRIEND;--This evening a company of eleven friends reached here,\r\nhaving left their homes on the night of the 26th inst. They came into\r\nWilmington, about ten o'clock on the morning of the 27th, and left\r\nthere, in the town, their two carriages, drawn by two horses. They went\r\nto Thomas Garrett's by open day-light and from thence were sent hastily\r\nonward for fear of pursuit. They reached Longwood meeting-house in the\r\nevening, at which place a Fair Circle had convened, and stayed a while\r\nin the meeting, then, after remaining all night with one of the Kennet\r\nfriends, they were brought to Downingtown early in the morning, and from\r\nthence, by daylight, to within a short distance of this place.\r\n\r\nThey come from New Chestertown, within five miles of the place from\r\nwhich the nine lately forwarded came, and left behind them a colored\r\nwoman who knew of their intended flight and of their intention of\r\npassing through Wilmington and leaving their horses and carriages there.\r\n\r\nI have been thus particular in my statement, because the case seems to\r\nus one of unusual danger. We have separated the company for the present,\r\nsending a mother and five children, two of them quite small, in one\r\ndirection, and a husband and wife and three lads in another, until I\r\ncould write to you and get advice if you have any to give, as to the\r\nbest method of forwarding them, and assistance pecuniarily, in getting\r\nthem to Canada. The mother and children we have sent off of the usual\r\nroute, and to a place where I do not think they can remain many days.\r\n\r\nWe shall await hearing from you. H. Kimber will be in the city on third\r\nday, the 30th, and any thing left at 408 Green Street directed to his\r\ncare, will meet with prompt attention.\r\n\r\nPlease give me again the direction of Hiram Wilson and the friend in\r\nElmira, Mr. Jones, I think. If you have heard from any of the nine since\r\ntheir safe arrival, please let us know when you write.\r\n\r\nVery Respectfully,\r\n\r\nG.A. LEWIS.\r\n\r\n_2d day morning, 29th_.--The person who took the husband and wife and\r\nthree lads to E.F. Pennypecker, and Peart, has returned and reports that\r\nL. Peart sent three on to Norristown. We fear that there they will fall\r\ninto the hands of an ignorant colored man Daniel Ross, and that he may\r\nnot understand the necessity of caution. Will you please write to some\r\ncareful person there? The woman and children detained in this\r\nneighborhood are a very helpless set. Our plan was to assist them as\r\nmuch as possible, and when we get things into the proper train for\r\nsending them on, to get the assistance of the husband and wife, who have\r\nno children, but are uncle and aunt to the woman with five, in taking\r\nwith them one of the younger children, leaving fewer for the mother. Of\r\nthe lads, or young men, there is also one whom we thought capable of\r\naccompanying one of the older girls--one to whom he is paying attention,\r\nthey told us. Would it not be the best way to get those in Norristown\r\nunder your own care? It seems to me their being sent on could then be\r\nbetter arranged. This, however, is only a suggestion,\r\n\r\nHastily yours,\r\n\r\nG.A. LEWIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM E.L. STEVENS, ESQ. _(The reader will interpret for\r\nhimself_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., July 11th, 1858.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Susan Bell left here yesterday with the child of her\r\nrelative, and since leaving I have thought, perhaps, you had not the\r\naddress of the gentleman in Syracuse where the child is to be taken for\r\nmedical treatment, etc. His name is Dr. H.B. Wilbur. A woman living with\r\nhim is a most excellent nurse and will take a deep interest in the\r\nchild, which, no doubt, will under Providence be the means of its\r\ncomplete restoration to health. Be kind enough to inform me whether\r\nSusan is with you, and if she is give her the proper direction. _Ten\r\npackages_ were sent to your address last evening, one of them belongs to\r\nSusan, and she had better remain with you till she gets it, as it may\r\nnot have come to hand. Susan thought she would go to Harrisburg when she\r\nleft here and stay over Sunday, if so, she would not get to Philadelphia\r\ntill Monday or Tuesday. Please acknowledge the receipt of this, and\r\ninform me of her arrival, also when the packages came safe to hand,\r\ninform me especially if Susan's came safely.\r\n\r\nTruly Yours,\r\n\r\nE.L. STEVENS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM S.H. GAY, ESQ., EX-EDITOR OF THE ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD AND\r\nNEW YORK TRIBUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIEND STILL:--The two women, Laura and Lizzy, arrived this morning. I\r\nshall forward them to Syracuse this afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe two men came safely yesterday, but went to Gibbs'. He has friends on\r\nboard the boat who are on the lookout for fugitives, and send them, when\r\nfound, to his house. Those whom you wish to be particularly under my\r\ncharge, must have careful directions to this office.\r\n\r\nThere is now no other sure place, but the office, or Gibbs', that I\r\ncould advise you to send such persons. Those to me, therefore, must come\r\nin office hours. In a few days, however, Napoleon will have a room down\r\ntown, and at odd times they can be sent there. I am not willing to put\r\nany more with the family where I have hitherto sometimes sent them.\r\n\r\nWhen it is possible I wish you would advise me two days before a\r\nshipment of your intention, as Napoleon is not always on hand to look\r\nout for them at short notice. In special cases you might advise me by\r\nTelegraph, thus: \"One M. (or one F.) this morning. W.S.\" By which I\r\nshall understand that one Male, or one Female, as the case may be, has\r\nleft Phila. by the 6 _o'clock train_--one or more, also, as the case may\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nAug. 17th, 1855.\r\n\r\nTruly Yours, S.H. GAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM JOHN H. HILL, A FUGITIVE, APPEALING IN BEHALF OF A POOR\r\nSLAVE IN PETERSBURG, VA.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON, Sept. 15th, 1856.\r\n\r\nDEAR FRIEND STILL:--I write to inform you that Miss Mary Wever arrived\r\nsafe in this city. You may imagine the happiness manifested on the part\r\nof the two lovers, Mr. H. and Miss W. I think they will be married as\r\nsoon as they can get ready. I presume Mrs. Hill will commence to make up\r\nthe articles to-morrow. Kind Sir, as all of us is concerned about the\r\nwelfare of our enslaved brethren at the South, particularly our friends,\r\nwe appeal to your sympathy to do whatever is in your power to save poor\r\nWillis Johnson from the hands of his cruel master. It is not for me to\r\ntell you of his case, because Miss Wever has related the matter fully to\r\nyou. All I wish to say is this, I wish you to write to my uncle, at\r\nPetersburg, by our friend, the Capt. Tell my uncle to go to Richmond and\r\nask my mother whereabouts this man is. The best for him is to make his\r\nway to Petersburg; that is, if you can get the Capt. to bring him. He\r\nhave not much money. But I hope the friends of humanity will not\r\nwithhold their aid on the account of money. However we will raise all\r\nthe money that is wanting to pay for his safe delivery. You will please\r\ncommunicate this to the friends as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nJOHN H. HILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM J. BIGELOW, ESQ.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., June 22d, 1854.\r\n\r\nMR. WILLIAM STILL:--_Sir_--I have just received a letter from my friend,\r\nWm. Wright, of York Sulphur Springs, Pa., in which he says, that by\r\nwriting to you, I may get some information about the transportation of\r\nsome _property_ from this neighborhood to your city or vicinity.\r\n\r\nA person who signs himself Wm. Penn, lately wrote to Mr. Wright, saying\r\nhe would pay $300 to have this service performed. It is for the\r\nconveyance of _only one_ SMALL package; but it has been discovered\r\nsince, that the removal cannot be so safely effected without taking _two\r\nlarger_ packages with it. I understand that the _three_ are to be\r\nbrought to this city and stored in safety, as soon as the forwarding\r\nmerchant in Philadelphia shall say he is ready to send on. The storage,\r\netc., here, will cost a trifle, but the $300 will be promptly paid for\r\nthe whole service. I think Mr. Wright's daughter, Hannah, has also seen\r\nyou. I am also known to Prof. C.D.

STILL:--_Dear Sir_--I am happy to think, that the time has come\r\nwhen we no doubt can open our correspondence with one another again.\r\nAlso I am in hopes, that these few lines may find you and family well\r\nand in the enjoyment of good health, as it leaves me and family the\r\nsame. I want you to know, that I feel as much determined to work in this\r\nglorious cause, as ever I did in all of my life, and I have some very\r\ngood hams on hand that I would like very much for you to have. I have\r\nnothing of interest to write about just now, only that the politics of\r\nthe day is in a high rage, and I don't know of the result, therefore, I\r\nwant you to be one of those wide-a-wakes as is mentioned from your\r\nsection of country now-a-days, &c. Also, if you wish to write to me, Mr.\r\nJ. Brown will inform you how to direct a letter to me.\r\n\r\nNo more at present, until I hear from you; but I want you to be a\r\nwide-a-wake.\r\n\r\nYours in haste,\r\n\r\nHAM & EGGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM REV H.

I have done the best I could for their comfort, but\r\nthey are about to proceed across the lake to Toronto, thinking they can\r\ndo better there than here, which is not unlikely. They all remember you\r\nas their friend and benefactor, and return to you their sincere thanks.\r\nMy means of support are so scanty, that I am obliged to write without\r\npaying postage, or not write at all. I hope you are not moneyless, as I\r\nam. In attending to the wants of numerous strangers, I am much of the\r\ntime perplexed from lack of means; but send on as many as you can and I\r\nwill divide with them to the last crumb.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nHIRAM WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM SHERIDAN FORD, IN DISTRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOSTON, MASS., Feb. 15th, 1855.\r\n\r\nNo. 2, Change Avenue.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND:--Allow me to take the liberty of addressing you and at\r\nthe same time appearing troublesomes you all friend, but subject is so\r\nvery important that i can not but ask not in my name but in the name of\r\nthe Lord and humanity to do something for my Poor Wife and children who\r\nlays in Norfolk Jail and have Been there for three month i Would open\r\nmyself in that frank and hones manner.

They arrived here this morning at 8-1/2 o'clock\r\nand left twenty minutes past three. You will please send me any\r\ninformation likely to prove interesting in relation to them.\r\n\r\nLately we have formed a Society here, called the Fugitive Aid Society.\r\nThis is our first case, and I hope it will prove entirely successful.\r\n\r\nWhen you write, please inform me what signs or symbols you make use of\r\nin your despatches, and any other information in relation to operations\r\nof the Underground Rail Road.\r\n\r\nOur reason for sending by the Reading Road, was to gain time; it is\r\nexpected the owners will be in town this afternoon, and by this Road we\r\ngained five hours' time, which is a matter of much importance, and we\r\nmay have occasion to use it sometimes in future. In great haste,\r\n\r\nYours with great respect,\r\n\r\nJos. C. BUSTILL,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM A SLAVE SECRETED IN RICHMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHMOND, VA, Oct. 18th, 1860.\r\n\r\nTo MR. WILLIAM STILL:--_Dear Sir_--Please do me the favor as to write to\r\nmy uncle a few lines in regard to the bundle that is for John H. Hill,\r\nwho lives in Hamilton, C.W. Sir, if this should reach you, be assured\r\nthat it comes from the same poor individual that you have heard of\r\nbefore; the person who was so unlucky, and deceived also. If you write,\r\naddress your letter John M. Hill, care of Box No. 250. I am speaking of\r\na person who lives in P.va. I hope, sir, you will understand this is\r\nfrom a poor individual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM G.S. NELSON (U.G.R.R. DEPOT).\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. STILL:--_My Dear Sir_--I suppose you are somewhat uneasy because the\r\ngoods did not come safe to hand on Monday evening, as you\r\nexpected--consigned from Harrisburg to you. The train only was from\r\nHarrisburg to Reading, and as it happened, the goods had to stay all\r\nnight with us, and as some excitement exists here about goods of the\r\nkind, we thought it expedient and wise to detain them until we could\r\nhear from you. There are two small boxes and two large ones; we have\r\nthem all secure; what had better be done? Let us know. Also, as we can\r\nlearn, there are three more boxes still in Harrisburg. Answer your\r\ncommunication at Harrisburg. Also, fail not to answer this by the return\r\nof mail, as things are rather critical, and you will oblige us.\r\n\r\nG.S. NELSON.\r\n\r\n_Reading, May 27, '57_.\r\n\r\nWe knew not that these goods were to come, consequently we were all\r\ntaken by surprise. When you answer, use the word, goods. The reason of\r\nthe excitement, is: some three weeks ago a big box was consigned to us\r\nby J. Bustill, of Harrisburg. We received it, and forwarded it on to J.\r\nJones, Elmira, and the next day they were on the fresh hunt of said box;\r\nit got safe to Elmira, as I have had a letter from Jones, and all is\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nG.S.N.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM JOHN THOMPSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR.

PENN\" (OF THE BAR).\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., Dec. 9th, 1856.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I was unavoidably prevented yesterday, from replying to yours\r\nof 6th instant, and although I have made inquiries, I am unable\r\n_to-day_, to answer your questions satisfactorily. Although I know some\r\nof the residents of Loudon county, and have often visited there, still I\r\nhave not practiced much in the Courts of that county. There are several\r\nof my acquaintances here, who have lived in that county, and _possibly_,\r\nthrough my assistance, your commissions might be executed. If a better\r\nway shall not suggest itself to you, and you see fit to give me the\r\n_facts_ in the case, I can better judge of my ability to help you; _but\r\nI know not the man resident there, whom I would trust with an important\r\nsuit_. I think it is now some four or five weeks since, that some\r\npackages left this vicinity, said to be from fifteen to twenty in\r\nnumber, and as I suppose, went through your hands. It was at a time of\r\nuncommon vigilance here, and to me it was a matter of extreme wonder,\r\n_how and through whom_, such a work was accomplished. Can you tell me?\r\nIt is _needful_ that I should know! Not for curiosity merely, but for\r\nthe good of others. An enclosed slip contains the _marks_ of one of the\r\npackages, which you will read and then _immediately burn_.\r\n\r\nIf you can give me any light that will _benefit others_, I am sure you\r\nwill do so.\r\n\r\nA traveler here, _very reliable_, and who knows his business, has\r\ndetermined not to leave home again till spring, at least not without\r\nextraordinary temptations.\r\n\r\nI think, however, he or others, might be tempted to travel in Virginia.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nWM. P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM MISS THEODOCIA GILBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    SKANEATELES (GLEN HAVEN) CHUY., 1851.\r\n\r\n    WILLIAM STILL:--_Dear Friend and Brother_--A thousand thanks for\r\n    your good, generous letter!\r\n\r\n    It was so kind of you to have in mind my intense interest and\r\n    anxiety in the success and fate of poor Concklin! That he\r\n    desired and intended to hazard an attempt of the kind, I well\r\n    understood; but what particular one, or that he had actually\r\n    embarked in the enterprise, I had not been able to learn.\r\n\r\n    His memory will ever be among the sacredly cherished with me. He\r\n    certainly displayed more real disinterestedness, more earnest,\r\n    unassuming devotedness, than those who _claim_ to be the\r\n    sincerest friends of the slave can often boast. What more\r\n    _Saviour_-like than the _willing_ sacrifice he has rendered!\r\n\r\n    Never shall I forget that night of our extremest peril (as we\r\n    supposed), when he came and so heartily proffered his services\r\n    at the hazard of his liberty, of life even, in behalf of William\r\n    L. Chaplin.\r\n\r\n    _Such_ generosity! at _such_ a moment! The emotions it awakened\r\n    no words can bespeak! They are to be sought but in the inner\r\n    chambers of one's own soul! He as earnestly devised the means,\r\n    as calmly counted the cost, and as unshrinkingly turned him to\r\n    the task, as if it were his own freedom he would have won.\r\n\r\n    Through his homely features, and humble garb, the intrepidity of\r\n    soul came out in all its lustre! Heroism, in its native majesty,\r\n    _commanded_ one's admiration and love!\r\n\r\n    Most truly can I enter into your sorrows, and painfully\r\n    appreciate the pang of disappointment which must have followed\r\n    this sad intelligence. But so inadequate are words to the\r\n    consoling of such griefs, it were almost cruel to attempt to\r\n    syllable one's sympathies.\r\n\r\n    I cannot bear to believe, that Concklin has been actually\r\n    murdered, and yet I hardly dare hope it is otherwise.\r\n\r\n    And the poor slaves, for whom he periled so much, into what\r\n    depths of hopelessness and woe are they again plunged! But the\r\n    deeper and blacker for the loss of their dearly sought and\r\n    new-found freedom. How long must wrongs like these go\r\n    unredressed? \"_How long, O God, how long_?\"\r\n\r\n    Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n    THEODOCIA GILBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM PEEL, ALIAS WILLIAM BOX PEEL JONES.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVED PER ERRICSON LINE OF STEAMERS, WRAPPED IN STRAW AND BOXED UP,\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL, 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam is twenty-five years of age, unmistakably colored, good-looking,\r\nrather under the medium size, and of pleasing manners. William had\r\nhimself boxed up by a near relative and forwarded by the Erricson line\r\nof steamers. He gave the slip to Robert H. Carr, his owner (a grocer and\r\ncommission merchant), after this wise, and for the following reasons:\r\nFor some time previous his master had been selling off his slaves every\r\nnow and then, the same as other groceries, and this admonished William\r\nthat he was liable to be in the market any day; consequently, he\r\npreferred the box to the auction-block.\r\n\r\nHe did not complain of having been treated very badly by Carr, but felt\r\nthat no man was safe while owned by another. In fact, he \"hated the very\r\nname of slaveholder.\" The limit of the box not admitting of\r\nstraightening himself out he was taken with the cramp on the road,\r\nsuffered indescribable misery, and had his faith taxed to the\r\nutmost,--indeed was brought to the very verge of \"screaming aloud\" ere\r\nrelief came. However, he controlled himself, though only for a short\r\nseason, for before a great while an excessive faintness came over him.\r\nHere nature became quite exhausted. He thought he must \"die;\" but his\r\ntime had not yet come. After a severe struggle he revived, but only to\r\nencounter a third ordeal no less painful than the one through which he\r\nhad just passed. Next a very \"cold chill\" came over him, which seemed\r\nalmost to freeze the very blood in his veins and gave him intense agony,\r\nfrom which he only found relief on awaking, having actually fallen\r\nasleep in that condition. Finally, however, he arrived at Philadelphia,\r\non a steamer, Sabbath morning. A devoted friend of his, expecting him,\r\nengaged a carriage and repaired to the wharf for the box. The bill of\r\nlading and the receipt he had with him, and likewise knew where the box\r\nwas located on the boat. Although he well knew freight was not usually\r\ndelivered on Sunday, yet his deep solicitude for the safety of his\r\nfriend determined him to do all that lay in his power to rescue him from\r\nhis perilous situation. Handing his bill of lading to the proper officer\r\nof the boat, he asked if he could get the freight that it called for.\r\nThe officer looked at the bill and said, \"No, we do not deliver freight\r\non Sunday;\" but, noticing the anxiety of the man, he asked him if he\r\nwould know it if he were to see it. Slowly--fearing that too much\r\ninterest manifested might excite suspicion--he replied: \"I think I\r\nshould.\" Deliberately looking around amongst all the \"freight,\" he\r\ndiscovered the box, and said, \"I think that is it there.\" Said officer\r\nstepped to it, looked at the directions on it, then at the bill of\r\nlading, and said, \"That is right, take it along.\" Here the interest in\r\nthese two bosoms was thrilling in the highest degree. But the size of\r\nthe box was too large for the carriage, and the driver refused to take\r\nit. Nearly an hour and a half was spent in looking for a furniture car.\r\nFinally one was procured, and again the box was laid hold of by the\r\noccupant's particular friend, when, to his dread alarm, the poor fellow\r\nwithin gave a sudden cough. At this startling circumstance he dropped\r\nthe box; equally as quick, although dreadfully frightened, and, as if\r\nhelped by some invisible agency, he commenced singing, \"Hush, my babe,\r\nlie still and slumber,\" with the most apparent indifference, at the same\r\ntime slowly making his way from the box. Soon his fears subsided, and it\r\nwas presumed that no one was any the wiser on account of the accident,\r\nor coughing. Thus, after summoning courage, he laid hold of the box a\r\nthird time, and the Rubicon was passed. The car driver, totally ignorant\r\nof the contents of the box, drove to the number to which he was directed\r\nto take it--left it and went about his business. Now is a moment of\r\nintense interest--now of inexpressible delight. The box is opened, the\r\nstraw removed, and the poor fellow is loosed; and is rejoicing, I will\r\nventure to say, as mortal never did rejoice, who had not been in similar\r\nperil. This particular friend was scarcely less overjoyed, however, and\r\ntheir joy did not abate for several hours; nor was it confined to\r\nthemselves, for two invited members of the Vigilance Committee also\r\npartook of a full share. This box man was named Wm. Jones. He was boxed\r\nup in Baltimore by the friend who received him at the wharf, who did not\r\ncome in the boat with him, but came in the cars and met him at the\r\nwharf.\r\n\r\nThe trial in the box lasted just seventeen hours before victory was\r\nachieved. Jones was well cared for by the Vigilance Committee and sent\r\non his way rejoicing, feeling that Resolution, Underground Rail Road,\r\nand Liberty were invaluable.\r\n\r\nOn his way to Canada, he stopped at Albany, and the subjoined letter\r\ngives his view of things from that stand-point--\r\n\r\n\r\n    MR. STILL:--I take this opportunity of writing a few lines to\r\n    you hoping that tha may find you in good health and femaly. i am\r\n    well at present and doing well at present i am now in a store\r\n    and getting sixteen dollars a month at the present. i feel very\r\n    much o blige to you and your family for your kindnes to me while\r\n    i was with you i have got a long without any trub le a tal. i am\r\n    now in albany City. give my lov to mrs and mr miller and tel\r\n    them i am very much a blige to them for there kind ns. give my\r\n    lov to my Brother nore Jones tel him i should like to here from\r\n    him very much and he must write. tel him to give my love to all\r\n    of my perticnlar frends and tel them i should like to see them\r\n    very much. tel him that he must come to see me for i want to see\r\n    him for sum thing very perticler. please ansure this letter as\r\n    soon as posabul and excuse me for not writting sooner as i don't\r\n    write myself. no more at the present.\r\n\r\n    WILLIAM JONES.\r\n\r\n    derect to one hundred 125 lydus. stt\r\n\r\n\r\nHis good friend returned to Baltimore the same day the box man started\r\nfor the North, and immediately dispatched through the post the following\r\nbrief letter, worded in Underground Rail Road parables:\r\n\r\n\r\n    BALTIMO APRIL 16, 1859.\r\n\r\n    W. STILL:--Dear brother i have taken the opportunity of writing\r\n    you these few lines to inform you that i am well an hoping these\r\n    few lines may find you enjoying the same good blessing please to\r\n    write me word at what time was it when isreal went to Jerico i\r\n    am very anxious to hear for thare is a mighty host will pass\r\n    over and you and i my brother will sing hally luja i shall\r\n    notify you when the great catastrophe shal take place No more at\r\n    the present but remain your brother\r\n\r\n    N.L.J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWESLEY HARRIS,[A] ALIAS ROBERT JACKSON, AND THE MATTERSON BROTHERS.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Shot by slave-hunters.]\r\n\r\nIn setting out for freedom, Wesley was the leader of this party. After\r\ntwo nights of fatiguing travel at a distance of about sixty miles from\r\nhome, the young aspirants for liberty were betrayed, and in an attempt\r\nmade to capture them a most bloody conflict ensued. Both fugitives and\r\npursuers were the recipients of severe wounds from gun shots, and other\r\nweapons used in the contest.\r\n\r\nWesley bravely used his fire arms until almost fatally wounded by one of\r\nthe pursuers, who with a heavily loaded gun discharged the contents with\r\ndeadly aim in his left arm, which raked the flesh from the bone for a\r\nspace of about six inches in length. One of Wesley's companions also\r\nfought heroically and only yielded when badly wounded and quite\r\noverpowered. The two younger (brothers of C. Matterson) it seemed made\r\nno resistance.\r\n\r\nIn order to recall the adventures of this struggle, and the success of\r\nWesley Harris, it is only necessary to copy the report as then penned\r\nfrom the lips of this young hero, while on the Underground Rail Road,\r\neven then in a very critical state. Most fearful indeed was his\r\ncondition when he was brought to the Vigilance Committee in this City.\r\n\r\nUNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD RECORD.\r\n\r\n_November 2d_, 1853.--Arrived: Robert Jackson (shot man), _alias_ Wesley\r\nHarris; age twenty-two years; dark color; medium height, and of slender\r\nstature.\r\n\r\nRobert was born in Martinsburg, Va., and was owned by Philip Pendleton.\r\nFrom a boy he had always been hired out. At the first of this year he\r\ncommenced services with Mrs. Carroll, proprietress of the United States\r\nHotel at Harper's Ferry. Of Mrs. Carroll he speaks in very grateful\r\nterms, saying that she was kind to him and all the servants, and\r\npromised them their freedom at her death. She excused herself for not\r\ngiving them their freedom on the ground that her husband died insolvent,\r\nleaving her the responsibility of settling his debts.\r\n\r\nBut while Mrs. Carroll was very kind to her servants, her manager was\r\nequally as cruel. About a month before Wesley left, the overseer, for\r\nsome trifling cause, attempted to flog him, but was resisted, and\r\nhimself flogged. This resistance of the slave was regarded by the\r\noverseer as an unpardonable offence; consequently he communicated the\r\nintelligence to his owner, which had the desired effect on his mind as\r\nappeared from his answer to the overseer, which was nothing less than\r\ninstructions that if he should again attempt to correct Wesley and he\r\nshould repel the wholesome treatment, the overseer was to put him in\r\nprison and sell him. Whether he offended again or not, the following\r\nChristmas he was to be sold without fail.\r\n\r\nWesley's mistress was kind enough to apprise him of the intention of his\r\nowner and the overseer, and told him that if he could help himself he\r\nhad better do so. So from that time Wesley began to contemplate how he\r\nshould escape the doom which had been planned for him.\r\n\r\n\"A friend,\" says he, \"by the name of C. Matterson, told me that he was\r\ngoing off. Then I told him of my master's writing to Mrs. Carroll\r\nconcerning selling, etc., and that I was going off too. We then\r\nconcluded to go together. There were two others--brothers of\r\nMatterson--who were told of our plan to escape, and readily joined with\r\nus in the undertaking. So one Saturday night, at twelve o'clock, we set\r\nout for the North. After traveling upwards of two days and over sixty\r\nmiles, we found ourselves unexpectedly in Terrytown, Md. There we were\r\ninformed by a friendly colored man of the danger we were in and of the\r\nbad character of the place towards colored people, especially those who\r\nwere escaping to freedom; and he advised us to hide as quickly as we\r\ncould. We at once went to the woods and hid. Soon after we had secreted\r\nourselves a man came near by and commenced splitting wood, or rails,\r\nwhich alarmed us. We then moved to another hiding-place in a thicket\r\nnear a farmer's barn, where we were soon startled again by a dog\r\napproaching and barking at us. The attention of the owner of the dog was\r\ndrawn to his barking and to where we were. The owner of the dog was a\r\nfarmer. He asked us where we were going. We replied to Gettysburg--to\r\nvisit some relatives, etc. He told us that we were running off. He then\r\noffered friendly advice, talked like a Quaker, and urged us to go with\r\nhim to his barn for protection. After much persuasion, we consented to\r\ngo with him.\r\n\r\n\"Soon after putting us in his barn, himself and daughter prepared us a\r\nnice breakfast, which cheered our spirits, as we were hungry. For this\r\nkindness we paid him one dollar. He next told us to hide on the mow till\r\neve, when he would safely direct us on our road to Gettysburg. All, very\r\nmuch fatigued from traveling, fell asleep, excepting myself; I could not\r\nsleep; I felt as if all was not right.\r\n\r\n\"About noon men were heard talking around the barn. I woke my companions\r\nup and told them that that man had betrayed us. At first they did not\r\nbelieve me. In a moment afterwards the barn door was opened, and in came\r\nthe men, eight in number. One of the men asked the owner of the barn if\r\nhe had any long straw. 'Yes,' was the answer. So up on the mow came\r\nthree of the men, when, to their great surprise, as they pretended, we\r\nwere discovered. The question was then asked the owner of the barn by\r\none of the men, if he harbored runaway negroes in his barn? He answered,\r\n'No,' and pretended to be entirely ignorant of their being in his barn.\r\nOne of the men replied that four negroes were on the mow, and he knew of\r\nit. The men then asked us where we were, going. We told them to\r\nGettysburg, that we had aunts and a mother there. Also we spoke of a Mr.\r\nHoughman, a gentleman we happened to have some knowledge of, having seen\r\nhim in Virginia. We were next asked for our passes. We told them that we\r\nhadn't any, that we had not been required to carry them where we came\r\nfrom. They then said that we would have to go before a magistrate, and\r\nif he allowed us to go on, well and good. The men all being armed and\r\nfurnished with ropes, we were ordered to be tied. I told them if they\r\ntook me they would have to take me dead or crippled. At that instant one\r\nof my friends cried out--'Where is the man that betrayed us?' Spying him\r\nat the same moment, he shot him (badly wounding him). Then the conflict\r\nfairly began. The constable seized me by the collar, or rather behind my\r\nshoulder. I at once shot him with my pistol, but in consequence of his\r\nthrowing up his arm, which hit mine as I fired, the effect of the load\r\nof my pistol was much turned aside; his face, however, was badly burned,\r\nbesides his shoulder being wounded. I again fired on the pursuers, but\r\ndo not know whether I hit anybody or not. I then drew a sword, I had\r\nbrought with me, and was about cutting my way to the door, when I was\r\nshot by one of the men, receiving the entire contents of one load of a\r\ndouble barreled gun in my left arm, that being the arm with which I was\r\ndefending myself. The load brought me to the ground, and I was unable to\r\nmake further struggle for myself. I was then badly beaten with guns, &c.\r\nIn the meantime, my friend Craven, who was defending himself, was shot\r\nbadly in the face, and most violently beaten until he was conquered and\r\ntied. The two young brothers of Craven stood still, without making the\r\nleast resistance. After we were fairly captured, we were taken to\r\nTerrytown, which was in sight of where we were betrayed. By this time I\r\nhad lost so much blood from my wounds, that they concluded my situation\r\nwas too dangerous to admit of being taken further; so I was made a\r\nprisoner at a tavern, kept by a man named Fisher. There my wounds were\r\ndressed, and thirty-two shot were taken from my arm. For three days I\r\nwas crazy, and they thought I would die. During the first two weeks,\r\nwhile I was a prisoner at the tavern, I raised a great deal of blood,\r\nand was considered in a very dangerous condition--so much so that\r\npersons desiring to see me were not permitted. Afterwards I began to get\r\nbetter, and was then kept privately--was strictly watched day and night.\r\nOccasionally, however, the cook, a colored woman (Mrs. Smith), would\r\nmanage to get to see me. Also James Matthews succeeded in getting to see\r\nme; consequently, as my wounds healed, and my senses came to me, I began\r\nto plan how to make another effort to escape. I asked one of the\r\nfriends, alluded to above, to get me a rope. He got it. I kept it about\r\nme four days in my pocket; in the meantime I procured three nails. On\r\nFriday night, October 14th, I fastened my nails in under the window\r\nsill; tied my rope to the nails, threw my shoes out of the window, put\r\nthe rope in my mouth, then took hold of it with my well hand, clambered\r\ninto the window, very weak, but I managed to let myself down to the\r\nground. I was so weak, that I could scarcely walk, but I managed to\r\nhobble off to a place three quarters of a mile from the tavern, where a\r\nfriend had fixed upon for me to go, if I succeeded in making my escape.\r\nThere I was found by my friend, who kept me secure till Saturday eve,\r\nwhen a swift horse was furnished by James Rogers, and a colored man\r\nfound to conduct me to Gettysburg. Instead of going direct to\r\nGettysburg, we took a different road, in order to shun our pursuers, as\r\nthe news of my escape had created general excitement. My three other\r\ncompanions, who were captured, were sent to Westminster jail, where they\r\nwere kept three weeks, and afterwards sent to Baltimore and sold for\r\ntwelve hundred dollars a piece, as I was informed while at the tavern in\r\nTerrytown.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DESPERATE CONFLICT IN A BARN.]\r\n\r\nThe Vigilance Committee procured good medical attention and afforded the\r\nfugitive time for recuperation, furnished him with clothing and a free\r\nticket, and sent him on his way greatly improved in health, and strong\r\nin the faith that, \"He who would be free, himself must strike the blow.\"\r\nHis safe arrival in Canada, with his thanks, were duly announced. And\r\nsome time after becoming naturalized, in one of his letters, he wrote\r\nthat he was a brakesman on the Great Western R.R., (in Canada--promoted\r\nfrom the U.G.R.R.,) the result of being under the protection of the\r\nBritish Lion.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF ROMULUS HALL--NEW NAME GEORGE WEEMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn March, 1857, Abram Harris fled from John Henry Suthern, who lived\r\nnear Benedict, Charles county, Md., where he was engaged in the farming\r\nbusiness, and was the owner of about seventy head of slaves. He kept an\r\noverseer, and usually had flogging administered daily, on males and\r\nfemales, old and young. Abram becoming very sick of this treatment,\r\nresolved, about the first of March, to seek out the Underground Rail\r\nRoad. But for his strong attachment to his wife (who was owned by Samuel\r\nAdams, but was \"pretty well treated\"), he never would have consented to\r\nsuffer as he did.\r\n\r\nHere no hope of comfort for the future seemed to remain. So Abram\r\nconsulted with a fellow-servant, by the name of Romulus Hall, alias\r\nGeorge Weems, and being very warm friends, concluded to start together.\r\nBoth had wives to \"tear themselves from,\" and each was equally ignorant\r\nof the distance they had to travel, and the dangers and sufferings to be\r\nendured. But they \"trusted in God\" and kept the North Star in view. For\r\nnine days and nights, without a guide, they traveled at a very\r\nexhausting rate, especially as they had to go fasting for three days,\r\nand to endure very cold weather. Abram's companion, being about fifty\r\nyears of age, felt obliged to succumb, both from hunger and cold, and\r\nhad to be left on the way. Abram was a man of medium size, tall, dark\r\nchestnut color, and could read and write a little and was quite\r\nintelligent; \"was a member of the Mount Zion Church,\" and occasionally\r\nofficiated as an \"exhorter,\" and really appeared to be a man of genuine\r\nfaith in the Almighty, and equally as much in freedom.\r\n\r\nIn substance, Abram gave the following information concerning his\r\nknowledge of affairs on the farm under his master--\r\n\r\n\"Master and mistress very frequently visited the Protestant Church, but\r\nwere not members. Mistress was very bad. About three weeks before I\r\nleft, the overseer, in a violent fit of bad temper, shot and badly\r\nwounded a young slave man by the name of Henry Waters, but no sooner\r\nthan he got well enough he escaped, and had not been heard of up to the\r\ntime Abram left. About three years before this happened, an overseer of\r\nmy master was found shot dead on the road. At once some of the slaves\r\nwere suspected, and were all taken to the Court House, at Serentown, St.\r\nMary's county; but all came off clear. After this occurrence a new\r\noverseer, by the name of John Decket, was employed. Although his\r\npredecessor had been dead three years, Decket, nevertheless, concluded\r\nthat it was not 'too late' to flog the secret out of some of the slaves.\r\nAccordingly, he selected a young slave man for his victim, and flogged\r\nhim so cruelly that he could scarcely walk or stand, and to keep from\r\nbeing actually killed, the boy told an untruth, and confessed that he\r\nand his Uncle Henry killed Webster, the overseer; whereupon the poor\r\nfellow was sent to jail to be tried for his life.\"\r\n\r\nBut Abram did not wait to hear the verdict. He reached the Committee\r\nsafely in this city, in advance of his companion, and was furnished with\r\na free ticket and other needed assistance, and was sent on his way\r\nrejoicing. After reaching his destination, he wrote back to know how his\r\nfriend and companion (George) was getting along; but in less than three\r\nweeks after he had passed, the following brief story reveals the sad\r\nfate of poor _Romulus Hall_, who had journeyed with him till exhausted\r\nfrom hunger and badly frost-bitten.\r\n\r\nA few days after his younger companion had passed on North, Romulus was\r\nbrought by a pitying stranger to the Vigilance Committee, in a most\r\nshocking condition. The frost had made sad havoc with his feet and legs,\r\nso much so that all sense of feeling had departed therefrom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEATH OF ROMULUS HALL.]\r\n\r\nHow he ever reached this city is a marvel. On his arrival medical\r\nattention and other necessary comforts were provided by the Committee,\r\nwho hoped with himself, that he would be restored with the loss of his\r\ntoes alone. For one week he seemed to be improving; at the expiration of\r\nthis time, however, his symptoms changed, indicating not only the end of\r\nslavery, but also the end of all his earthly troubles.\r\n\r\nLockjaw and mortification set in in the most malignant form, and for\r\nnearly thirty-six hours the unfortunate victim suffered in extreme\r\nagony, though not a murmur escaped him for having brought upon himself\r\nin seeking his liberty this painful infliction and death. It was\r\nwonderful to see how resignedly he endured his fate.\r\n\r\nBeing anxious to get his testimony relative to his escape, etc., the\r\nChairman of the Committee took his pencil and expressed to him his\r\nwishes in the matter. Amongst other questions, he was asked: \"Do you\r\nregret having attempted to escape from slavery?\" After a severe spasm he\r\nsaid, as his friend was about to turn to leave the room, hopeless of\r\nbeing gratified in his purpose: \"Don't go; I have not answered your\r\nquestion. I am glad I escaped from slavery!\" He then gave his name, and\r\ntried to tell the name of his master, but was so weak he could not be\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nAt his bedside, day and night, Slavery looked more heinous than it had\r\never done before. Only think how this poor man, in an enlightened\r\nChristian land, for the bare hope of freedom, in a strange land amongst\r\nstrangers, was obliged not only to bear the sacrifice of his wife and\r\nkindred, but also of his own life.\r\n\r\nNothing ever appeared more sad than seeing him in a dying posture, and\r\ninstead of reaching his much coveted destination in Canada, going to\r\nthat \"bourne whence no traveler returns.\" Of course it was expedient,\r\neven after his death, that only a few friends should follow him to his\r\ngrave. Nevertheless, he was decently buried in the beautiful Lebanon\r\nCemetery.\r\n\r\nIn his purse was found one single five cent piece, his whole pecuniary\r\ndependence.\r\n\r\nThis was the first instance of death on the Underground Rail Road in\r\nthis region.\r\n\r\nThe Committee were indebted to the medical services of the well-known\r\nfriends of the fugitive, Drs. J.L. Griscom and H.T. Childs, whose\r\nfaithful services were freely given; and likewise to Mrs. H.S. Duterte\r\nand Mrs. Williams, who generously performed the offices of charity and\r\nfriendship at his burial.\r\n\r\nFrom his companion, who passed on Canada-ward without delay, we received\r\na letter, from which, as an item of interest, we make the following\r\nextract:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I am enjoying good health, and hope when this reaches you, you\r\n    may be enjoying the same blessing. Give my love to Mr. ----, and\r\n    family, and tell them I am in a land of liberty! I am a man\r\n    among men!\" (The above was addressed to the deceased.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subjoined letter, from Rev. L.D. Mansfield, expressed on behalf of\r\nRomulus' companion, his sad feelings on hearing of his friend's death.\r\nAnd here it may not be inappropriate to add, that clearly enough is it\r\nto be seen, that Rev. Mansfield was one of the rare order of ministers,\r\nwho believed it right \"to do unto others as one would be done by\" in\r\npractice, not in theory merely, and who felt that they could no more be\r\nexcused for \"falling down,\" in obedience to the Fugitive Slave Law under\r\nPresident Fillmore, than could Daniel for worshiping the \"golden image\"\r\nunder Nebuchadnezzar.\r\n\r\n\r\n    AUBURN, NEW YORK, MAY 4TH, 1857.\r\n\r\n    DEAR BR. STILL:--Henry Lemmon wishes me to write to you in reply\r\n    to your kind letter, conveying the intelligence of the death of\r\n    your fugitive guest, Geo. Weems. He was deeply affected at the\r\n    intelligence, for he was most devotedly attached to him and had\r\n    been for many years. Mr. Lemmon now expects his sister to come\r\n    on, and wishes you to aid her in any way in your power--as he\r\n    knows you will.\r\n\r\n    He wishes you to send the coat and cap of Weems by his sister\r\n    when she comes. And when you write out the history of Weems'\r\n    escape, and it is published, that you would send him a copy of\r\n    the papers. He has not been very successful in getting work yet.\r\n\r\n    Mr. and Mrs. Harris left for Canada last week. The friends made\r\n    them a purse of $15 or $20, and we hope they will do well.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Lemmon sends his respects to you and Mrs. Still. Give my\r\n    kind regards to her and accept also yourself,\r\n\r\n    Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n    L.D. MANSFIELD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES MERCER, WM. H. GILLIAM, AND JOHN CLAYTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOWED AWAY IN A HOT BERTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis arrival came by Steamer. But they neither came in State-room nor as\r\nCabin, Steerage, or Deck passengers.\r\n\r\nA certain space, not far from the boiler, where the heat and coal dust\r\nwere almost intolerable,--the colored steward on the boat in answer to\r\nan appeal from these unhappy bondmen, could point to no other place for\r\nconcealment but this. Nor was he at all certain that they could endure\r\nthe intense heat of that place. It admitted of no other posture than\r\nlying flat down, wholly shut out from the light, and nearly in the same\r\npredicament in regard to the air. Here, however, was a chance of\r\nthrowing off the yoke, even if it cost them their lives. They considered\r\nand resolved to try it at all hazards.\r\n\r\nHenry Box Brown's sufferings were nothing, compared to what these men\r\nsubmitted to during the entire journey.\r\n\r\nThey reached the house of one of the Committee about three o'clock, A.M.\r\n\r\nAll the way from the wharf the cold rain poured down in torrents and\r\nthey got completely drenched, but their hearts were swelling with joy\r\nand gladness unutterable. From the thick coating of coal dust, and the\r\neffect of the rain added thereto, all traces of natural appearance were\r\nentirely obliterated, and they looked frightful in the extreme. But they\r\nhad placed their lives in mortal peril for freedom.\r\n\r\nEvery step of their critical journey was reviewed and commented on, with\r\nmatchless natural eloquence,--how, when almost on the eve of suffocating\r\nin their warm berths, in order to catch a breath of air, they were\r\ncompelled to crawl, one at a time, to a small aperture; but scarcely\r\nwould one poor fellow pass three minutes being thus refreshed, ere the\r\nothers would insist that he should \"go back to his hole.\" Air was\r\nprecious, but for the time being they valued their liberty at still\r\ngreater price.\r\n\r\nAfter they had talked to their hearts' content, and after they had been\r\nthoroughly cleansed and changed in apparel, their physical appearance\r\ncould be easily discerned, which made it less a wonder whence such\r\noutbursts of eloquence had emanated. They bore every mark of determined\r\nmanhood.\r\n\r\nThe date of this arrival was February 26, 1854, and the following\r\ndescription was then recorded--\r\n\r\nArrived, by Steamer Pennsylvania, James Mercer, William H. Gilliam and\r\nJohn Clayton, from Richmond.\r\n\r\nJames was owned by the widow, Mrs. T.E. White. He is thirty-two years of\r\nage, of dark complexion, well made, good-looking, reads and writes, is\r\nvery fluent in speech, and remarkably intelligent. From a boy, he had\r\nbeen hired out. The last place he had the honor to fill before escaping,\r\nwas with Messrs. Williams and Brother, wholesale commission merchants.\r\nFor his services in this store the widow had been drawing one hundred\r\nand twenty-five dollars per annum, clear of all expenses.\r\n\r\nHe did not complain of bad treatment from his mistress, indeed, he spoke\r\nrather favorably of her. But he could not close his eyes to the fact,\r\nthat at one time Mrs. White had been in possession of thirty head of\r\nslaves, although at the time he was counting the cost of escaping, two\r\nonly remained--himself and William, (save a little boy) and on himself a\r\nmortgage for seven hundred and fifty dollars was then resting. He could,\r\ntherefore, with his remarkably quick intellect, calculate about how long\r\nit would be before he reached the auction block.\r\n\r\nHe had a wife but no child. She was owned by Mr. Henry W. Quarles. So\r\nout of that Sodom he felt he would have to escape, even at the cost of\r\nleaving his wife behind. Of course he felt hopeful that the way would\r\nopen by which she could escape at a future time, and so it did, as will\r\nappear by and by. His aged mother he had to leave also.\r\n\r\nWm. Henry Gilliam likewise belonged to the Widow White, and he had been\r\nhired to Messrs. White and Brother to drive their bread wagon. William\r\nwas a baker by trade. For his services his mistress had received one\r\nhundred and thirty-five dollars per year. He thought his mistress quite\r\nas good, if not a little better than most slave-holders. But he had\r\nnever felt persuaded to believe that she was good enough for him to\r\nremain a slave for her support.\r\n\r\nIndeed, he had made several unsuccessful attempts before this time to\r\nescape from slavery and its horrors. He was fully posted from A to Z,\r\nbut in his own person he had been smart enough to escape most of the\r\nmore brutal outrages. He knew how to read and write, and in readiness of\r\nspeech and general natural ability was far above the average of slaves.\r\n\r\nHe was twenty-five years of age, well made, of light complexion, and\r\nmight be put down as a valuable piece of property.\r\n\r\nThis loss fell with crushing weight upon the kind-hearted mistress, as\r\nwill be seen in a letter subjoined which she wrote to the unfaithful\r\nWilliam, some time after he had fled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM MRS. L.E. WHITE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    RICHMOND, 16th, 1854.\r\n\r\n    DEAR HENRY:--Your mother and myself received your letter; she is\r\n    much distressed at your conduct; she is remaining just as you\r\n    left her, she says, and she will never be reconciled to your\r\n    conduct.\r\n\r\n    I think Henry, you have acted most dishonorably; had you have\r\n    made a confidant of me I would have been better off; and you as\r\n    you are. I am badly situated, living with Mrs. Palmer, and\r\n    having to put up with everything--your mother is also\r\n    dissatisfied--I am miserably poor, do not get a cent of your\r\n    hire or James', besides losing you both, but if you can\r\n    _reconcile_ so do. By renting a cheap house, I might have lived,\r\n    now it seems starvation is before me. Martha and the Doctor are\r\n    living in Portsmouth, it is not in her power to do much for me.\r\n    I know you will repent it. I heard six weeks before you went,\r\n    that you were trying to persuade him off--but we all liked you,\r\n    and I was unwilling to believe it--however, I leave it in God's\r\n    hands He will know what to do. Your mother says that I must tell\r\n    you servant Jones is _dead_ and old _Mrs. Galt_. Kit is well,\r\n    but we are very uneasy, losing your and _James' hire_, I fear\r\n    poor little fellow, that he will be obliged to go, as I am\r\n    compelled to live, and it will be your fault. I am quite unwell,\r\n    but of course, you don't care.\r\n\r\n    Yours,\r\n\r\n    L.E. WHITE.\r\n\r\n    If you choose to come back you could. I would do a very good\r\n    part by you, Toler and Cooke has none.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis touching epistle was given by the disobedient William to a member\r\nof the Vigilant Committee, when on a visit to Canada, in 1855, and it\r\nwas thought to be of too much value to be lost. It was put away with\r\nother valuable U.G.R.R. documents for future reference. Touching the\r\n\"rascality\" of William and James and the unfortunate predicament in\r\nwhich it placed the kind-hearted widow, Mrs. Louisa White, the following\r\neditorial clipped from the wide-awake Richmond Despatch, was also highly\r\nappreciated, and preserved as conclusive testimony to the successful\r\nworking of the U.G.R.R. in the Old Dominion. It reads thus--\r\n\r\n\"RASCALITY SOMEWHERE.--We called attention yesterday to the\r\nadvertisement of two negroes belonging to Mrs. Louisa White, by Toler &\r\nCook, and in the call we expressed the opinion that they were still\r\nlurking about the city, preparatory to going off. Mr. Toler, we find, is\r\nof a different opinion. He believes that they have already cleared\r\nthemselves--have escaped to a Free State, and we think it extremely\r\nprobable that he is in the right. They were both of them uncommonly\r\nintelligent negroes. One of them, the one hired to Mr. White, was a\r\ntip-top baker. He had been all about the country, and had been in the\r\nhabit of supplying the U.S. Pennsylvania with bread; Mr. W. having the\r\ncontract. In his visits for this purpose, of course, he formed\r\nacquaintances with all sorts of sea-faring characters; and there is\r\nevery reason to believe that he has been assisted to get off in that\r\nway, along with the other boy, hired to the Messrs. Williams. That the\r\ntwo acted in concert, can admit of no doubt. The question is now to find\r\nout how they got off. They must undoubtedly have had white men in the\r\nsecret. Have we then a nest of Abolition scoundrels among us? There\r\nought to be a law to put a police officer on board every vessel as soon\r\nas she lands at the wharf. There is one, we believe for inspecting\r\nvessels before they leave. If there is not there ought to be one.\r\n\r\n\"These negroes belong to a widow lady and constitute all the property\r\nshe has on earth. They have both been raised with the greatest\r\nindulgence. Had it been otherwise, they would never have had an\r\nopportunity to escape, as they have done. Their flight has left her\r\npenniless. Either of them would readily have sold for $1200; and Mr.\r\nToler advised their owner to sell them at the commencement of the year,\r\nprobably anticipating the very thing that has happened. She refused to\r\ndo so, because she felt too much attachment to them. They have made a\r\nfine return, truly.\"\r\n\r\nNo comment is necessary on the above editorial except simply to express\r\nthe hope that the editor and his friends who seemed to be utterly\r\nbefogged as to how these \"uncommonly intelligent negroes\" made their\r\nescape, will find the problem satisfactorily solved in this book.\r\n\r\nHowever, in order to do even-handed justice to all concerned, it seems\r\nbut proper that William and James should be heard from, and hence a\r\nletter from each is here appended for what they are worth. True they\r\nwere intended only for private use, but since the \"True light\" (Freedom)\r\nhas come, all things may be made manifest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM WILLIAM HENRY GILLIAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    ST.

STILL, DEAR FRIEND:--I received a letter from the poor old\r\n    widow, Mrs. L.E. White, and she says I may come back if I choose\r\n    and she will do a good part by me. Yes, yes I am choosing the\r\n    western side of the South for my home. She is smart, but cannot\r\n    bung my eye, so she shall have to die in the poor house at last,\r\n    so she says, and Mercer and myself will be the cause of it. That\r\n    is all right. I am getting even with her now for I was in the\r\n    poor house for twenty-five years and have just got out. And she\r\n    said she knew I was coming away six weeks before I started, so\r\n    you may know my chance was slim. But Mr. John Wright said I came\r\n    off like a gentleman and he did not blame me for coming for I\r\n    was a great boy. Yes I here him enough he is all gas. I am in\r\n    Canada, and they cannot help themselves.\r\n\r\n    About that subject I will not say anything more. You must write\r\n    to me as soon as you can and let me here the news and how the\r\n    Family is and yourself. Let me know how the times is with the\r\n    U.G.R.R. Co. Is it doing good business?

He was owned by the Widow Clayton, and\r\nwas white enough to have been nearly related to her, being a mulatto. He\r\nwas about thirty-five years of age, a man of fine appearance, and quite\r\nintelligent. Several years previous he had made an attempt to escape,\r\nbut failed. Prior to escaping in this instance, he had been laboring in\r\na tobacco factory at $150 a year. It is needless to say that he did not\r\napprove of the \"peculiar institution.\" He left a wife and one child\r\nbehind to mourn after him. Of his views of Canada and Freedom, the\r\nfollowing frank and sensible letter, penned shortly after his arrival,\r\nspeaks for itself--\r\n\r\n\r\n    TORONTO, March 6th, 1854.\r\n\r\n    DEAR MR.

Two months and a half before she succeeded in getting off,\r\nClarissa had made a desperate effort, but failed. The brothers\r\nsucceeded, but she was left. She had not given up all hope of escape,\r\nhowever, and therefore sought \"a safe hiding-place until an opportunity\r\nmight offer,\" by which she could follow her brothers on the U.G.R.R.\r\nClarissa was owned by Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Burkley, of Portsmouth, under\r\nwhom she had always served.\r\n\r\nOf them she spoke favorably, saying that she \"had not been used as hard\r\nas many others were.\" At this period, Clarissa was about twenty-two\r\nyears of age, of a bright brown complexion, with handsome features,\r\nexceedingly respectful and modest, and possessed all the characteristics\r\nof a well-bred young lady. For one so little acquainted with books as\r\nshe was, the correctness of her speech was perfectly astonishing.\r\n\r\nFor Clarissa and her two brothers a \"reward of one thousand dollars\" was\r\nkept standing in the papers for a length of time, as these (articles)\r\nwere considered very rare and valuable; the best that could be produced\r\nin Virginia.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the brothers had passed safely on to New Bedford, but\r\nClarissa remained secluded, \"waiting for the storm to subside.\" Keeping\r\nup courage day by day, for seventy-five days, with the fear of being\r\ndetected and severely punished, and then sold, after all her hopes and\r\nstruggles, required the faith of a martyr. Time after time, when she\r\nhoped to succeed in making her escape, ill luck seemed to disappoint\r\nher, and nothing but intense suffering appeared to be in store. Like\r\nmany others, under the crushing weight of oppression, she thought she\r\n\"should have to die\" ere she tasted liberty. In this state of mind, one\r\nday, word was conveyed to her that the steamship, City of Richmond, had\r\narrived from Philadelphia, and that the steward on board (with whom she\r\nwas acquainted), had consented to secrete her this trip, if she could\r\nmanage to reach the ship safely, which was to start the next day. This\r\nnews to Clarissa was both cheering and painful. She had been \"praying\r\nall the time while waiting,\" but now she felt \"that if it would only\r\nrain right hard the next morning about three o'clock, to drive the\r\npolice officers off the street, then she could safely make her way to\r\nthe boat.\" Therefore she prayed anxiously all that day that it would\r\nrain, \"but no sign of rain appeared till towards midnight.\" The prospect\r\nlooked horribly discouraging; but she prayed on, and at the appointed\r\nhour (three o'clock--before day), the rain descended in torrents.\r\nDressed in male attire, Clarissa left the miserable coop where she had\r\nbeen almost without light or air for two and a half months, and\r\nunmolested, reached the boat safely, and was secreted in a box by Wm.\r\nBagnal, a clever young man who sincerely sympathized with the slave,\r\nhaving a wife in slavery himself; and by him she was safely delivered\r\ninto the hands of the Vigilance Committee.\r\n\r\nClarissa Davis here, by advice of the Committee, dropped her old name,\r\nand was straightway christened \"Mary D. Armstead.\" Desiring to join her\r\nbrothers and sister in New Bedford, she was duly furnished with her\r\nU.G.R.R. passport and directed thitherward. Her father, who was left\r\nbehind when she got off, soon after made his way on North, and joined\r\nhis children. He was too old and infirm probably to be worth anything,\r\nand had been allowed to go free, or to purchase himself for a mere\r\nnominal sum. Slaveholders would, on some such occasions, show wonderful\r\nliberality in letting their old slaves go free, when they could work no\r\nmore. After reaching New Bedford, Clarissa manifested her gratitude in\r\nwriting to her friends in Philadelphia repeatedly, and evinced a very\r\nlively interest in the U.G.R.R. The appended letter indicates her\r\nsincere feelings of gratitude and deep interest in the cause--\r\n\r\n\r\n    NEW BEDFORD, August 26, 1855.\r\n\r\n    MR. STILL:--I avail my self to write you thes few lines hopeing\r\n    they may find you and your family well as they leaves me very\r\n    well and all the family well except my father he seams to be\r\n    improveing with his shoulder he has been able to work a little I\r\n    received the papers I was highly delighted to receive them I was\r\n    very glad to hear from you in the wheler case I was very glad to\r\n    hear that the persons ware safe I was very sory to hear that mr\r\n    Williamson was put in prison but I know if the praying part of\r\n    the people will pray for him and if he will put his trust in the\r\n    lord he will bring him out more than conquer please remember my\r\n    Dear old farther and sisters and brothers to your family kiss\r\n    the children for me I hear that the yellow fever is very bad\r\n    down south now if the underground railroad could have free\r\n    course the emergrant would cross the river of gordan rapidly I\r\n    hope it may continue to run and I hope the wheels of the car may\r\n    be greesed with more substantial greese so they may run over\r\n    swiftly I would have wrote before but circumstances would not\r\n    permit me  Miss Sanders and all the friends desired to be\r\n    remembered to you and your family I shall be pleased to hear\r\n    from the underground rail road often.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n\r\n    MARY D. ARMSTEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANTHONY BLOW, ALIAS HENRY LEVISON.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRETED TEN MONTHS BEFORE STARTING--EIGHT DAYS STOWED AWAY ON A STEAMER\r\nBOUND FOR PHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nArrived from Norfolk, about the 1st of November, 1854. Ten months before\r\nstarting, Anthony had been closely concealed. He belonged to the estate\r\nof Mrs. Peters, a widow, who had been dead about one year before his\r\nconcealment.\r\n\r\nOn the settlement of his old mistress' estate, which was to take place\r\none year after her death, Anthony was to be transferred to Mrs. Lewis, a\r\ndaughter of Mrs. Peters (the wife of James Lewis, Esq.). Anthony felt\r\nwell satisfied that he was not the slave to please the \"tyrannical\r\nwhims\" of his anticipated master, young Lewis, and of course he hated\r\nthe idea of having to come under his yoke. And what made it still more\r\nunpleasant for Anthony was that Mr. Lewis would frequently remind him\r\nthat it was his intention to \"sell him as soon as he got possession--the\r\nfirst day of January.\" \"I can get fifteen hundred dollars for you\r\neasily, and I will do it.\" This contemptuous threat had caused Anthony's\r\nblood to boil time and again. But Anthony had to take the matter as\r\ncalmly as possible, which, however, he was not always able to do.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, Anthony concluded that his \"young master had counted the\r\nchickens before they were hatched.\" Indeed here Anthony began to be a\r\ndeep thinker. He thought, for instance, that he had already been shot\r\nthree times, at the instance of slave-holders. The first time he was\r\nshot was for refusing a flogging when only eighteen years of age. The\r\nsecond time, he was shot in the head with squirrel shot by the sheriff,\r\nwho was attempting to arrest him for having resisted three \"young white\r\nruffians,\" who wished to have the pleasure of beating him, but got\r\nbeaten themselves. And in addition to being shot this time, Anthony was\r\nstill further \"broke in\" by a terrible flogging from the Sheriff. The\r\nthird time Anthony was shot he was about twenty-one years of age. In\r\nthis instance he was punished for his old offence--he \"would not be\r\nwhipped.\"\r\n\r\nThis time his injury from being shot was light, compared with the two\r\npreceding attacks. Also in connection with these murderous conflicts, he\r\ncould not forget that he had been sold on the auction block. But he had\r\nstill deeper thinking to do yet. He determined that his young master\r\nshould never get \"fifteen hundred dollars for him on the 1st of\r\nJanuary,\" unless he got them while he (Anthony) was running. For Anthony\r\nhad fully made up his mind that when the last day of December ended, his\r\nbondage should end also, even if he should have to accept death as a\r\nsubstitute. He then began to think of the Underground Rail Road and of\r\nCanada; but who the agents were, or how to find the depot, was a serious\r\npuzzle to him. But his time was getting so short he was convinced that\r\nwhatever he did would have to be done quickly. In this frame of mind he\r\nfound a man who professed to know something about the Underground Rail\r\nRoad, and for \"thirty dollars\" promised to aid him in the matter.\r\n\r\nThe thirty dollars were raised by the hardest effort and passed over to\r\nthe pretended friend, with the expectation that it would avail greatly\r\nin the emergency. But Anthony found himself sold for thirty dollars, as\r\nnothing was done for him. However, the 1st day of January arrived, but\r\nAnthony was not to be found to answer to his name at roll call. He had\r\n\"took out\" very early in the morning. Daily he prayed in his place of\r\nconcealment how to find the U.G.R.R. Ten months passed away, during\r\nwhich time he suffered almost death, but persuaded himself to believe\r\nthat even that was better than slavery. With Anthony, as it has been\r\nwith thousands of others similarly situated, just as everything was\r\nlooking the most hopeless, word came to him in his place of concealment\r\nthat a friend named Minkins, employed on the steamship City of Richmond,\r\nwould undertake to conceal him on the boat, if he could be crowded in a\r\ncertain place, which was about the only spot that would be perfectly\r\nsafe. This was glorious news to Anthony; but it was well for him that he\r\nwas ignorant of the situation that awaited him on the boat, or his heart\r\nmight have failed him. He was willing, however, to risk his life for\r\nfreedom, and, therefore, went joyfully.\r\n\r\nThe hiding-place was small and he was large. A sitting attitude was the\r\nonly way he could possibly occupy it. He was contented. This place was\r\n\"near the range, directly over the boiler,\" and of course, was very\r\nwarm. Nevertheless, Anthony felt that he would not murmur, as he knew\r\nwhat suffering was pretty well, and especially as he took it for granted\r\nthat he would be free in about a day and a half--the usual time it took\r\nthe steamer to make her trip. At the appointed hour the steamer left\r\nNorfolk for Philadelphia, with Anthony sitting flat down in his U.G.R.R.\r\nberth, thoughtful and hopeful. But before the steamer had made half her\r\ndistance the storm was tossing the ship hither and thither fearfully.\r\nHead winds blew terribly, and for a number of days the elements seemed\r\nperfectly mad. In addition to the extraordinary state of the weather,\r\nwhen the storm subsided the fog took its place and held the mastery of\r\nthe ship with equal despotism until the end of over seven days, when\r\nfinally the storm, wind, and fog all disappeared, and on the eighth day\r\nof her boisterous passage the steamship City of Richmond landed at the\r\nwharf of Philadelphia, with this giant and hero on board who had\r\nsuffered for ten months in his concealment on land and for eight days on\r\nthe ship.\r\n\r\nAnthony was of very powerful physical proportions, being six feet three\r\ninches in height, quite black, very intelligent, and of a temperament\r\nthat would not submit to slavery. For some years his master, Col.\r\nCunnagan, had hired him out in Washington, where he was accused of being\r\nin the schooner Pearl, with Capt. Drayton's memorable \"seventy fugitives\r\non board, bound for Canada.\" At this time he was stoker in a machine\r\nshop, and was at work on an anchor weighing \"ten thousand pounds.\" In\r\nthe excitement over the attempt to escape in the Pearl, many were\r\narrested, and the officers with irons visited Anthony at the machine\r\nshop to arrest him, but he declined to let them put the hand-cuffs on\r\nhim, but consented to go with them, if permitted to do so without being\r\nironed. The officers yielded, and Anthony went willingly to the jail.\r\nPassing unnoticed other interesting conflicts in his hard life, suffice\r\nit to say, he left his wife, Ann, and three children, Benjamin, John and\r\nAlfred, all owned by Col. Cunnagan. In this brave-hearted man, the\r\nCommittee felt a deep interest, and accorded him their usual\r\nhospitalities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERRY JOHNSON, OF ELKTON, MARYLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nEYE KNOCKED OUT, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerry's exit was in November, 1853. He was owned by Charles Johnson, who\r\nlived at Elkton. The infliction of a severe \"flogging\" from the hand of\r\nhis master awakened Perry to consider the importance of the U.G.R.R.\r\nPerry had the misfortune to let a \"load of fodder upset,\" about which\r\nhis master became exasperated, and in his agitated state of mind he\r\nsucceeded in affixing a number of very ugly stationary marks on Perry's\r\nback. However, this was no new thing. Indeed he had suffered at the\r\nhands of his mistress even far more keenly than from these \"ugly marks.\"\r\nHe had but one eye; the other he had been deprived of by a terrible\r\nstroke with a cowhide in the \"hand of his mistress.\" This lady he\r\npronounced to be a \"perfect savage,\" and added that \"she was in the\r\nhabit of cowhiding any of her slaves whenever she felt like it, which\r\nwas quite often.\" Perry was about twenty-eight years of age and a man of\r\npromise. The Committee attended to his wants and forwarded him on North.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISAAC FORMAN, WILLIAM DAVIS, AND WILLIS REDICK.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEARTS FULL OF JOY FOR FREEDOM--VERY ANXIOUS FOR WIVES IN SLAVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese passengers all arrived together, concealed, per steamship City of\r\nRichmond, December, 1853. Isaac Forman, the youngest of the\r\nparty--twenty-three years of age and a dark mulatto--would be considered\r\nby a Southerner capable of judging as \"very likely.\" He fled from a\r\nwidow by the name of Mrs. Sanders, who had been in the habit of hiring\r\nhim out for \"one hundred and twenty dollars a year.\" She belonged in\r\nNorfolk, Va.; so did Isaac. For four years Isaac had served in the\r\ncapacity of steward on the steamship Augusta. He stated that he had a\r\nwife living in Richmond, and that she was confined the morning he took\r\nthe U.G.R.R. Of course he could not see her. The privilege of living in\r\nRichmond with his wife \"had been denied him.\" Thus, fearing to render\r\nher unhappy, he was obliged to conceal from her his intention to escape.\r\n\"Once or twice in the year was all the privilege allowed\" him to visit\r\nher. This only added \"insult to injury,\" in Isaac's opinion; wherefore\r\nhe concluded that he would make one less to have to suffer thus, and\r\ncommon sense said he was wise in the matter. No particular charges are\r\nfound recorded on the U.G.R.R. books against the mistress. He went to\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nIn the subjoined letters (about his wife) is clearly revealed the\r\nsincere gratitude he felt towards those who aided him: at the same time\r\nit may be seen how the thought of his wife being in bondage grieved his\r\nheart. It would have required men with stone hearts to have turned deaf\r\nears to such appeals. Extract from letter soon after reaching\r\nCanada--hopeful and happy--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF LETTER FROM ISAAC FORMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    TORONTO, Feb. 20th, 1854.\r\n\r\n    MR. WILLIAM STILL:--_Sir_--Your kind letter arrived safe at hand\r\n    on the 18th, and I was very happy to receive it. I now feel that\r\n    I should return you some thanks for your kindness. Dear sir I do\r\n    pray from the bottom of my heart, that the high heavens may\r\n    bless you for your kindness; give my love to Mr. Bagnel and Mr.\r\n    Minkins, ask them if they have heard anything from my brother,\r\n    tell Mr. Bagnel to give my love to my sister-in-law and mother\r\n    and all the family. I am now living at Russell's Hotel; it is\r\n    the first situation I have had since I have been here and I like\r\n    it very well. Sir you would oblige me by letting me know if Mr.\r\n    Minkins has seen my wife; you will please let me know as soon as\r\n    possible. I wonder if Mr. Minkins has thought of any way that he\r\n    can get my wife away. I should like to know in a few days.\r\n\r\n    Your well wisher,\r\n\r\n    ISAAC FORMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother letter from Isaac. He is very gloomy and his heart is almost\r\nbreaking about his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    TORONTO, May 7,1854.\r\n\r\n    MR. W. STILL:--_Dear Sir_--I take this opportunity of writing\r\n    you these few lines and hope when they reach you they will find\r\n    you well. I would have written you before, but I was waiting to\r\n    hear from my friend, Mr. Brown. I judge his business has been of\r\n    importance as the occasion why he has not written before. Dear\r\n    sir, nothing would have prevented me from writing, in a case of\r\n    this kind, except death.\r\n\r\n    My soul is vexed, my troubles are inexpressible. I often feel as\r\n    if I were willing to die. I must see my wife in short, if not, I\r\n    will die. What would I not give no tongue can utter. Just to\r\n    gaze on her sweet lips one moment I would be willing to die the\r\n    next. I am determined to see her some time or other. The thought\r\n    of being a slave again is miserable. I hope heaven will smile\r\n    upon me again, before I am one again. I will leave Canada again\r\n    shortly, but I don't name the place that I go, it may be in the\r\n    bottom of the ocean. If I had known as much before I left, as I\r\n    do now, I would never have left until I could have found means\r\n    to have brought her with me. You have never suffered from being\r\n    absent from a wife, as I have. I consider that to be nearly\r\n    superior to death, and hope you will do all you can for me, and\r\n    inquire from your friends if nothing can be done for me. Please\r\n    write to me immediately on receipt of this, and say something\r\n    that will cheer up my drooping spirits. You will oblige me by\r\n    seeing Mr. Brown and ask him if he would oblige me by going to\r\n    Richmond and see my wife, and see what arrangements he could\r\n    make with her, and I would be willing to pay all his expenses\r\n    there and back. Please to see both Mr. Bagnel and Mr. Minkins,\r\n    and ask them if they have seen my wife. I am determined to see\r\n    her, if I die the next moment. I can say I was once happy, but\r\n    never will be again, until I see her; because what is freedom to\r\n    me, when I know that my wife is in slavery? Those persons that\r\n    you shipped a few weeks ago, remained at St. Catherine, instead\r\n    of coming over to Toronto.

The post-office is shut,\r\n    so I enclose the money to pay the post, and please write me in\r\n    haste.\r\n\r\n    I remain evermore your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n    I. FORMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIS REDICK.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was owned by S.J. Wilson, a merchant, living in Portsmouth, Va.\r\nWillis was of a very dark hue, thick set, thirty-two years of age, and\r\npossessed of a fair share of mind. The owner had been accustomed to hire\r\nWillis out for \"one hundred dollars a year.\" Willis thought his lot\r\n\"pretty hard,\" and his master rather increased this notion by his\r\nseverity, and especially by \"threatening\" to sell him. He had enjoyed,\r\nas far as it was expected for a slave to do, \"five months of married\r\nlife,\" but he loved slavery no less on this account. In fact he had just\r\nbegun to consider what it was to have a wife and children that he \"could\r\nnot own or protect,\" and who were claimed as another's property.\r\nConsequently he became quite restive under these reflections and his\r\nmaster's ill-usage, and concluded to \"look out,\" without consulting\r\neither the master or the young wife.\r\n\r\nThis step looked exceedingly hard, but what else could the poor fellow\r\ndo? Slavery existed expressly for the purpose of crushing souls and\r\nbreaking tender hearts.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM DAVIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam might be described as a good-looking mulatto, thirty-one years\r\nof age, and capable of thinking for himself. He made no grave complaints\r\nof ill-usage under his master, \"Joseph Reynolds,\" who lived at Newton,\r\nPortsmouth, Va. However, his owner had occasionally \"threatened to sell\r\nhim.\" As this was too much for William's sensitive feelings, he took\r\numbrage at it and made a hasty and hazardous move, which resulted in\r\nfinding himself on the U.G.R.R. The most serious regret William had to\r\nreport to the Committee was, that he was compelled to \"leave\" his\r\n\"wife,\" Catharine, and his little daughter, Louisa, two years and one\r\nmonth, and an infant son seven months old. He evidently loved them very\r\ntenderly, but saw no way by which he could aid them, as long as he was\r\ndaily liable to be put on the auction block and sold far South. This\r\nargument was regarded by the Committee as logical and unanswerable;\r\nconsequently they readily endorsed his course, while they deeply\r\nsympathized with his poor wife and little ones. \"Before escaping,\" he\r\n\"dared not\" even apprise his wife and child, whom he had to leave behind\r\nin the prison house.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH HENRY CAMP.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUCTION BLOCK IS DEFEATED AND A SLAVE TRADER LOSES FOURTEEN HUNDRED\r\nDOLLARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn November, 1853, in the twentieth year of his age, Camp was held to\r\n\"service or labor\" in the City of Richmond, Va., by Dr. K. Clark. Being\r\nuncommonly smart and quite good-looking at the same time, he was a\r\nsaleable piece of merchandise. Without consulting his view of the matter\r\nor making the least intimation of any change, the master one day struck\r\nup a bargain with a trader for Joseph, and received _Fourteen Hundred\r\nDollars cash_ in consideration thereof. Mr. Robert Parrett, of Parson &\r\nKing's Express office, happened to have a knowledge of what had\r\ntranspired, and thinking pretty well of Joseph, confidentially put him\r\nin full possession of all the facts in the case. For reflection he\r\nhardly had five minutes. But he at once resolved to strike that day for\r\nfreedom--not to go home that evening to be delivered into the hands of\r\nhis new master. In putting into execution his bold resolve, he secreted\r\nhimself, and so remained for three weeks. In the meantime his mother,\r\nwho was a slave, resolved to escape also, but after one week's gloomy\r\nforeboding, she became \"faint-hearted and gave the struggle over.\" But\r\nJoseph did not know what surrender meant. His sole thought was to\r\nprocure a ticket on the U.G.R.R. for Canada, which by persistent effort\r\nhe succeeded in doing. He hid himself in a steamer, and by this way\r\nreached Philadelphia, where he received every accommodation at the usual\r\ndepot, was provided with a free ticket, and sent off rejoicing for\r\nCanada. The unfortunate mother was \"detected and sold South.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHERIDAN FORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRETED IN THE WOODS--ESCAPES IN A STEAMER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the twenty-ninth of January, 1855, Sheridan arrived from the Old\r\nDominion and a life of bondage, and was welcomed cordially by the\r\nVigilance Committee. Miss Elizabeth Brown of Portsmouth, Va. claimed\r\nSheridan as her property. He spoke rather kindly of her, and felt that\r\nhe \"had not been used very hard\" as a general thing, although, he wisely\r\nadded, \"the best usage was bad enough.\" Sheridan had nearly reached his\r\ntwenty-eighth year, was tall and well made, and possessed of a\r\nconsiderable share of intelligence.\r\n\r\nNot a great while before making up his mind to escape, for some trifling\r\noffence he had been \"stretched up with a rope by his hands,\" and\r\n\"whipped unmercifully.\" In addition to this he had \"got wind of the\r\nfact,\" that he was to be auctioneered off; soon these things brought\r\nserious reflections to Sheridan's mind, and among other questions, he\r\nbegan to ponder how he could get a ticket on the U.G.R.R., and get out\r\nof this \"place of torment,\" to where he might have the benefit of his\r\nown labor. In this state of mind, about the fourteenth day of November,\r\nhe took his first and daring step. He went not, however, to learned\r\nlawyers or able ministers of the Gospel in his distress and trouble, but\r\nwended his way \"directly to the woods,\" where he felt that he would be\r\nsafer with the wild animals and reptiles, in solitude, than with the\r\nbarbarous civilization that existed in Portsmouth.\r\n\r\nThe first day in the woods he passed in prayer incessantly, all alone.\r\nIn this particular place of seclusion he remained \"four days and\r\nnights,\" \"two days suffered severely from hunger, cold and thirst.\"\r\nHowever, one who was a \"friend\" to him, and knew of his whereabouts,\r\nmanaged to get some food to him and consoling words; but at the end of\r\nthe four days this friend got into some difficulty and thus Sheridan was\r\nleft to \"wade through deep waters and head winds\" in an almost hopeless\r\nstate. There he could not consent to stay and starve to death.\r\nAccordingly he left and found another place of seclusion--with a friend\r\nin the town--for a pecuniary consideration. A secret passage was\r\nprocured for him on one of the steamers running between Philadelphia and\r\nRichmond, Va. When he left his poor wife, Julia, she was then \"lying in\r\nprison to be sold,\" on the simple charge of having been suspected of\r\nconniving at her husband's escape. As a woman she had known something of\r\nthe \"barbarism of slavery\", from every-day experience, which the large\r\nscars about her head indicated--according to Sheridan's testimony. She\r\nwas the mother of two children, but had never been allowed to have the\r\ncare of either of them. The husband, utterly powerless to offer her the\r\nleast sympathy in word or deed, left this dark habitation of cruelty, as\r\nabove referred to, with no hope of ever seeing wife or child again in\r\nthis world.\r\n\r\nThe Committee afforded him the usual aid and comfort, and passed him on\r\nto the next station, with his face set towards Boston. He had heard the\r\nslaveholders \"curse\" Boston so much, that he concluded it must be a\r\npretty safe place for the fugitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH KNEELAND, ALIAS JOSEPH HULSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph Kneeland arrived November 25, 1853. He was a prepossessing man of\r\ntwenty-six, dark complexion, and intelligent. At the time of Joseph's\r\nescape, he was owned by Jacob Kneeland, who had fallen heir to him as a\r\npart of his father's estate. Joseph spoke of his old master as having\r\ntreated him \"pretty well,\" but he had an idea that his young master had\r\na very \"malignant spirit;\" for even before the death of his old master,\r\nthe heir wanted him, \"Joe,\" sold, and after the old man died, matters\r\nappeared to be coming to a crisis very fast. Even as early as November,\r\nthe young despot had distinctly given \"Joe\" to understand, that he was\r\nnot to be hired out another year, intimating that he was to \"go\r\nsomewhere,\" but as to particulars, it was time enough for Joe to know\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOf course \"Joe\" looked at his master \"right good\" and saw right through\r\nhim, and at the same time, saw the U.G.R.R., \"darkly.\" Daily slavery\r\ngrew awfully mean, but on the other hand, Canada was looked upon as a\r\nvery desirable country to emigrate to, and he concluded to make his way\r\nthere, as speedily as the U.G.R.R. could safely convey him. Accordingly\r\nhe soon carried his design into practice, and on his arrival, the\r\nCommittee regarded him as a very good subject for her British Majesty's\r\npossessions in Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEX-PRESIDENT TYLER'S HOUSEHOLD LOSES AN ARISTOCRATIC \"ARTICLE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Hambleton Christian is a remarkable specimen of the \"well fed,\r\n&c.\" In talking with him relative to his life as a slave, he said very\r\npromptly, \"I have always been treated well; if I only have half as good\r\ntimes in the North as I have had in the South, I shall be perfectly\r\nsatisfied. Any time I desired spending money, five or ten dollars were\r\nno object.\" At times, James had borrowed of his master, one, two, and\r\nthree hundred dollars, to loan out to some of his friends. With regard\r\nto apparel and jewelry, he had worn the best, as an every-day adornment.\r\nWith regard to food also, he had fared as well as heart could wish, with\r\nabundance of leisure time at his command. His deportment was certainly\r\nvery refined and gentlemanly. About fifty per cent. of Anglo-Saxon blood\r\nwas visible in his features and his hair, which gave him no\r\ninconsiderable claim to sympathy and care. He had been to William and\r\nMary's College in his younger days, to wait on young master James B.C.,\r\nwhere, through the kindness of some of the students he had picked up a\r\ntrifling amount of book learning. To be brief, this man was born the\r\nslave of old Major Christian, on the Glen Plantation, Charles City\r\ncounty, Va. The Christians were wealthy and owned many slaves, and\r\nbelonged in reality to the F.F.V's. On the death of the old Major, James\r\nfell into the hands of his son, Judge Christian, who was executor to his\r\nfather's estate. Subsequently he fell into the hands of one of the\r\nJudge's sisters, Mrs. John Tyler (wife of Ex-President Tyler), and then\r\nhe became a member of the President's domestic household, was at the\r\nWhite House, under the President, from 1841 to 1845. Though but very\r\nyoung at that time, James was only fit for training in the arts,\r\nscience, and mystery of waiting, in which profession, much pains were\r\ntaken to qualify him completely for his calling.\r\n\r\nAfter a lapse of time; his mistress died. According to her request,\r\nafter this event, James and his old mother were handed over to her\r\nnephew, William H. Christian, Esq., a merchant of Richmond. From this\r\ngentleman, James had the folly to flee.\r\n\r\nPassing hurriedly over interesting details, received from him respecting\r\nhis remarkable history, two or three more incidents too good to omit\r\nmust suffice.\r\n\r\n\"How did you like Mr. Tyler?\" said an inquisitive member of the\r\nVigilance Committee. \"I didn't like Mr. Tyler much,\" was the reply.\r\n\"Why?\" again inquired the member of the Committee. \"Because Mr. Tyler\r\nwas a poor man. I never did like poor people. I didn't like his marrying\r\ninto our family, who were considered very far Tyler's superiors.\" \"On\r\nthe plantation,\" he said, \"Tyler was a very cross man, and treated the\r\nservants very cruelly; but the house servants were treated much better,\r\nowing to their having belonged to his wife, who protected them from\r\npersecution, as they had been favorite servants in her father's family.\"\r\nJames estimated that \"Tyler got about thirty-five thousand dollars and\r\ntwenty-nine slaves, young and old, by his wife.\"\r\n\r\nWhat prompted James to leave such pleasant quarters? It was this: He had\r\nbecome enamored of a young and respectable free girl in Richmond, with\r\nwhom he could not be united in marriage solely because he was a slave,\r\nand did not own himself. The frequent sad separations of such married\r\ncouples (where one or the other was a slave) could not be overlooked;\r\nconsequently, the poor fellow concluded that he would stand a better\r\nchance of gaining his object in Canada than by remaining in Virginia. So\r\nhe began to feel that he might himself be sold some day, and thus the\r\nresolution came home to him very forcibly to make tracks for Canada.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the good treatment he had always met with, a member of\r\nthe Committee remarked, \"You must be akin to some one of your master's\r\nfamily?\" To which he replied, \"I am Christian's son.\" Unquestionably\r\nthis passenger was one of that happy class so commonly referred to by\r\napologists for the \"Patriarchal Institution.\" The Committee, feeling a\r\ndeep interest in his story, and desiring great success to him in his\r\nUnderground efforts to get rid of slavery, and at the same time possess\r\nhimself of his affianced, made him heartily welcome, feeling assured\r\nthat the struggles and hardships he had submitted to in escaping, as\r\nwell as the luxuries he was leaving behind, were nothing to be compared\r\nwith the blessings of liberty and a free wife in Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD MORGAN, HENRY JOHNSON, JAMES AND STEPHEN BUTLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS REWARD.--The above Reward will be paid for\r\n    the apprehension of two blacks, who escaped on Sunday last. It\r\n    is supposed they have made their way to Pennsylvania. $500 will\r\n    be paid for the apprehension of either, so that we can get them\r\n    again. The oldest is named Edward Morgan, about five feet six or\r\n    seven inches, heavily made--is a dark black, has rather a down\r\n    look when spoken to, and is about 21 years of age.\r\n\r\n    \"Henry Johnson is a colored negro, about five feet seven or\r\n    eight inches, heavily made, aged nineteen years, has a pleasant\r\n    countenance, and has a mark on his neck below the ear.\r\n\r\n    \"Stephen Butler is a dark-complexioned negro, about five feet\r\n    seven inches; has a pleasant countenance, with a scar above his\r\n    eye; plays on the violin; about twenty-two years old.\r\n\r\n    \"Jim Butler is a dark-complexioned negro, five feet eight or\r\n    nine inches; is rather sullen when spoken to; face rough; aged\r\n    about twenty-one years.

He had been held\r\nas the property of the widow, \"Betsy Brown,\" who resided near Mill Green\r\nP.O., in Harford county, Md. \"She was a very bad woman; would go to\r\nchurch every Sunday, come home and go to fighting amongst the colored\r\npeople; was never satisfied; she treated my mother very hard, (said\r\nEd.); would beat her with a walking-stick, &c. She was an old woman and\r\nbelonged to the Catholic Church. Over her slaves she kept an overseer,\r\nwho was a very wicked man; very bad on colored people; his name was\r\n'Bill Eddy;' Elizabeth Brown owned twelve head.\"\r\n\r\nHenry is of a brown skin, a good-looking young man, only nineteen years\r\nof age, whose prepossessing appearance would insure a high price for him\r\nin the market--perhaps $1,700. With Edward, he testifies to the meanness\r\nof Mrs. Betsy Brown, as well as to his own longing desire for freedom.\r\nBeing a fellow-servant with Edward, Henry was a party to the plan of\r\nescape. In slavery he left his mother and three sisters, owned by the\r\n\"old woman\" from whom he escaped.\r\n\r\nJames is about twenty-one years of age, full black, and medium size. As\r\nhe had been worked hard on poor fare, he concluded to leave, in company\r\nwith his brother and two cousins, leaving his parents in slavery, owned\r\nby the \"Widow Pyle,\" who was also the owner of himself. \"She was upwards\r\nof eighty, very passionate and ill-natured, although a member of the\r\nPresbyterian Church.\" James may be worth $1,400.\r\n\r\nStephen is a brother of James', and is about the same size, though a\r\nyear older. His experience differed in no material respect from his\r\nbrother's; was owned by the same woman, whom he \"hated for her bad\r\ntreatment\" of him. Would bring $1,400, perhaps.\r\n\r\nIn substance, and to a considerable extent in the exact words, these\r\nfacts are given as they came from the lips of the passengers, who,\r\nthough having been kept in ignorance and bondage, seemed to have their\r\neyes fully open to the wrongs that had been heaped upon them, and were\r\nsingularly determined to reach free soil at all hazards. The Committee\r\nwillingly attended to their financial and other wants, and cheered them\r\non with encouraging advice.\r\n\r\nThey were indebted to \"The Baltimore Sun\" for the advertisement\r\ninformation. And here it may be further added, that the \"Sun\" was quite\r\nfamous for this kind of U.G.R.R. literature, and on that account alone\r\nthe Committee subscribed for it daily, and never failed to scan closely\r\ncertain columns, illustrated with a black man running away with a bundle\r\non his back. Many of these popular illustrations and advertisements were\r\npreserved, many others were sent away to friends at a distance, who took\r\na special interest in the U.G.R.R. matters. Friends and stockholders in\r\nEngland used to take a great interest in seeing how the fine arts, in\r\nthese particulars, were encouraged in the South (\"the land of\r\nchivalry\").\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY PREDO.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROKE JAIL, JUMPED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND MADE HIS ESCAPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry fled from Buckstown, Dorchester Co., Md., March, 1857. Physically\r\nhe is a giant. About 27 years of age, stout and well-made, quite black,\r\nand no fool, as will appear presently. Only a short time before he\r\nescaped, his master threatened to sell him south. To avoid that fate,\r\ntherefore, he concluded to try his luck on the Underground Rail Road,\r\nand, in company with seven others--two of them females--he started for\r\nCanada. For two or three days and nights they managed to outgeneral all\r\ntheir adversaries, and succeeded bravely in making the best of their way\r\nto a Free State.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however, a reward of $3,000 was offered for their\r\narrest. This temptation was too great to be resisted, even by the man\r\nwho had been intrusted with the care of them, and who had faithfully\r\npromised to pilot them to a safe place. One night, through the treachery\r\nof their pretended conductor, they were all taken into Dover Jail, where\r\nthe Sheriff and several others, who had been notified beforehand by the\r\nbetrayer, were in readiness to receive them. Up stairs they were taken,\r\nthe betrayer remarking as they were going up, that they were \"cold, but\r\nwould soon have a good warming.\" On a light being lit they discovered\r\nthe iron bars and the fact that they had been betrayed. Their\r\nliberty-loving spirits and purposes, however, did not quail. Though\r\nresisted brutally by the sheriff with revolver in hand, they made their\r\nway down one flight of stairs, and in the moment of excitement, as good\r\nluck would have it, plunged into the sheriff's private apartment, where\r\nhis wife and children were sleeping. The wife cried murder lustily. A\r\nshovel full of fire, to the great danger of burning the premises, was\r\nscattered over the room; out of the window jumped two of the female\r\nfugitives. Our hero Henry, seizing a heavy andiron, smashed out the\r\nwindow entire, through which the others leaped a distance of twelve\r\nfeet. The railing or wall around the jail, though at first it looked\r\nforbidding, was soon surmounted by a desperate effort.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of the proceedings, Henry found himself without the walls,\r\nand also lost sight of his comrades at the same time. The last enemy he\r\nspied was the sheriff in his stockings without his shoes. He snapped his\r\npistol at him, but it did not go off. Six of the others, however,\r\nmarvellously got off safely together; where the eighth went, or how he\r\ngot off, was not known.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDANIEL HUGHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaniel fled from Buckstown, Dorchester Co., also. His owner's name was\r\nRichard Meredith, a farmer. Daniel is one of the eight alluded to above.\r\nIn features he is well made, dark chestnut color, and intelligent,\r\npossessing an ardent thirst for liberty. The cause of his escape was:\r\n\"Worked hard in all sorts of weather--in rain and snow,\" so he thought\r\nhe would \"go where colored men are free.\" His master was considered the\r\nhardest man around. His mistress was \"eighty-three years of age,\" \"drank\r\nhard,\" was \"very stormy,\" and a \"member of the Methodist Church\" (Airy's\r\nmeeting-house). He left brothers and sisters, and uncles and aunts\r\nbehind. In the combat at the prison he played his part manfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS ELLIOTT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas is also one of the brave eight who broke out of Dover Jail. He\r\nwas about twenty-three years of age, well made, wide awake, and of a\r\nsuperb black complexion. He too had been owned by Richard Meredith.\r\nAgainst the betrayer, who was a black man, he had vengeance in store if\r\nthe opportunity should ever offer. Thomas left only one brother living;\r\nhis \"father and mother were dead.\"\r\n\r\nThe excitement over the escape spread very rapidly next morning, and\r\ndesperate efforts were made to recapture the fugitives, but a few\r\nfriends there were who had sympathy and immediately rendered them the\r\nneeded assistance.\r\n\r\nThe appended note from the faithful Garrett to Samuel Rhoads, may throw\r\nlight upon the occurrence to some extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILMINGTON, 3d mo. 13th, 1857.\r\n\r\n    DEAR COUSIN, SAMUEL RHOADS:--I have a letter this day from an\r\n    agent of the Underground Rail Road, near Dover, in this state,\r\n    saying I must be on the look out for six brothers and two\r\n    sisters, they were decoyed and betrayed, he says by a colored\r\n    man named Thomas Otwell, who pretended to be their friend, and\r\n    sent a _white scamp_ ahead to wait for them at Dover till they\r\n    arrived; they were arrested and put in Jail there, with Tom's\r\n    assistance, and some officers. On third day morning about four\r\n    o'clock, they broke jail; six of them are secreted in the\r\n    neighborhood, and the writer has not known what became of the\r\n    other two. The six were to start last night for this place. I\r\n    hear that their owners have persons stationed at several places\r\n    on the road watching. I fear they will be taken. If they could\r\n    lay quiet for ten days or two weeks, they might then get up\r\n    safe. I shall have two men sent this evening some four or five\r\n    miles below to keep them away from this town, and send them (if\r\n    found to Chester County). Thee may show this to Still and McKim,\r\n    and oblige thy cousin,\r\n\r\n    THOMAS GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther light about this exciting contest, may be gathered from a\r\ncolored conductor on the Road, in Delaware, who wrote as follows to a\r\nmember of the Vigilance Committee at Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CAMDEN, DEL., March 23d, 1857.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR;--I tak my pen in hand to write to you, to inform you\r\n    what we have had to go throw for the last two weaks.

Kennard.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe balance of these brave fugitives, although not named in this\r\nconnection, succeeded in getting off safely. But how the betrayer,\r\nsheriff and hunters got out of their dilemma, the Committee was never\r\nfully posted.\r\n\r\nThe Committee found great pleasure in assisting these passengers, for\r\nthey had the true grit. Such were always doubly welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARY EPPS, ALIAS EMMA BROWN--JOSEPH AND ROBERT ROBINSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SLAVE MOTHER LOSES HER SPEECH AT THE SALE OF HER CHILD--BOB ESCAPES\r\nFROM HIS MASTER, A TRADER, WITH $1500 IN NORTH CAROLINA MONEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMary fled from Petersburg and the Robinsons from Richmond. A fugitive\r\nslave law-breaking captain by the name of B., who owned a schooner, and\r\nwould bring any kind of freight that would pay the most, was the\r\nconductor in this instance. Quite a number of passengers at different\r\ntimes availed themselves of his accommodations and thus succeeded in\r\nreaching Canada.\r\n\r\nHis risk was very great. On this account he claimed, as did certain\r\nothers, that it was no more than fair to charge for his services--indeed\r\nhe did not profess to bring persons for nothing, except in rare\r\ninstances. In this matter the Committee did not feel disposed to\r\ninterfere directly in any way, further than to suggest that whatever\r\nunderstanding was agreed upon by the parties themselves should be\r\nfaithfully adhered to.\r\n\r\nMany slaves in cities could raise, \"by hook or by crook,\" fifty or one\r\nhundred dollars to pay for a passage, providing they could find one who\r\nwas willing to risk aiding them. Thus, while the Vigilance Committee of\r\nPhiladelphia especially neither charged nor accepted anything for their\r\nservices, it was not to be expected that any of the Southern agents\r\ncould afford to do likewise.\r\n\r\nThe husband of Mary had for a long time wanted his own freedom, but did\r\nnot feel that he could go without his wife; in fact, he resolved to get\r\nher off first, then to try and escape himself, if possible. The first\r\nessential step towards success, he considered, was to save his money and\r\nmake it an object to the captain to help him. So when he had managed to\r\nlay by one hundred dollars, he willingly offered this sum to Captain B.,\r\nif he would engage to deliver his wife into the hands of the Vigilance\r\nCommittee of Philadelphia. The captain agreed to the terms and fulfilled\r\nhis engagement to the letter. About the 1st of March, 1855, Mary was\r\npresented to the Vigilance Committee. She was of agreeable manners,\r\nabout forty-five years of age, dark complexion, round built, and\r\nintelligent. She had been the mother of fifteen children, four of whom\r\nhad been sold away from her; one was still held in slavery in\r\nPetersburg; the others were all dead.\r\n\r\nAt the sale of one of her children she was so affected with grief that\r\nshe was thrown into violent convulsions, which caused the loss of her\r\nspeech for one entire month. But this little episode was not a matter to\r\nexcite sympathy in the breasts of the highly refined and tender-hearted\r\nChristian mothers of Petersburg. In the mercy of Providence, however,\r\nher reason and strength returned.\r\n\r\nShe had formerly belonged to the late Littleton Reeves, whom she\r\nrepresented as having been \"kind\" to her, much more so than her mistress\r\n(Mrs. Reeves). Said Mary, \"She being of a jealous disposition, caused me\r\nto be hired out with a hard family, where I was much abused, frequently\r\nflogged, and stinted for food,\" etc.\r\n\r\nBut the sweets of freedom in the care of the Vigilance Committee now\r\ndelighted her mind, and the hope that her husband would soon follow her\r\nto Canada, inspired her with expectations that she would one day \"sit\r\nunder her own vine and fig tree where none dared to molest or make her\r\nafraid.\"\r\n\r\nThe Committee rendered her the usual assistance, and in due time,\r\nforwarded her on to Queen Victoria's free land in Canada. On her arrival\r\nshe wrote back as follows--\r\n\r\n\r\n    TORONTO, March 14th, 1855.\r\n\r\n    DEAR MR. STILL:--I take this opportunity of addressing you with\r\n    these few lines to inform you that I arrived here to-day, and\r\n    hope that this may find yourself and Mrs. Still well, as this\r\n    leaves me at the present. I will also say to you, that I had no\r\n    difficulty in getting along. the two young men that was with me\r\n    left me at Suspension Bridge. they went another way.\r\n\r\n    I cannot say much about the place as I have ben here but a short\r\n    time but so far as I have seen I like very well. you will give\r\n    my Respect to your lady, & Mr & Mrs Brown. If you have not\r\n    written to Petersburg you will please to write as soon as can I\r\n    have nothing More to Write at present but yours Respectfully\r\n\r\n    EMMA BROWN (old name MARY EPPS).\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, Joseph and Robert (Mary's associate passengers from Richmond) must\r\nhere be noticed. Joseph was of a dark orange color, medium size, very\r\nactive and intelligent, and doubtless, well understood the art of\r\nbehaving himself. He was well acquainted with the auction block--having\r\nbeen sold three times, and had had the misfortune to fall into the hands\r\nof a cruel master each time. Under these circumstances he had had but\r\nfew privileges. Sundays and week days alike he was kept pretty severely\r\nbent down to duty. He had been beaten and knocked around shamefully. He\r\nhad a wife, and spoke of her in most endearing language, although, on\r\nleaving, he did not feel at liberty to apprise her of his movements,\r\n\"fearing that it would not be safe so to do.\" His four little children,\r\nto whom he appeared warmly attached, he left as he did his wife--in\r\nSlavery. He declared that he \"stuck to them as long as he could.\" George\r\nE. Sadler, the keeper of an oyster house, held the deed for \"Joe,\" and a\r\nmost heartless wretch he was in Joe's estimation. The truth was, Joe\r\ncould not stand the burdens and abuses which Sadler was inclined to heap\r\nupon him. So he concluded to join his brother and go off on the U.G.R.R.\r\n\r\nRobert, his younger brother, was owned by Robert Slater, Esq., a regular\r\nnegro trader. Eight years this slave's duties had been at the slave\r\nprison, and among other daily offices he had to attend to, was to lock\r\nup the prison, prepare the slaves for sale, etc. Robert was a very\r\nintelligent young man, and from long and daily experience with the\r\ncustoms and usages of the slave prison, he was as familiar with the\r\nbusiness as a Pennsylvania farmer with his barn-yard stock. His account\r\nof things was too harrowing for detail here, except in the briefest\r\nmanner, and that only with reference to a few particulars. In order to\r\nprepare slaves for the market, it was usual to have them greased and\r\nrubbed to make them look bright and shining. And he went on further to\r\nstate, that \"females as well as males were not uncommonly stripped\r\nnaked, lashed flat to a bench, and then held by two men, sometimes four,\r\nwhile the brutal trader would strap them with a broad leather strap.\"\r\nThe strap being preferred to the cow-hide, as it would not break the\r\nskin, and damage the sale. \"One hundred lashes would only be a common\r\nflogging.\" The separation of families was thought nothing of. \"Often I\r\nhave been flogged for refusing to flog others.\" While not yet\r\ntwenty-three years of age, Robert expressed himself as having become so\r\ndaily sick of the brutality and suffering he could not help witnessing,\r\nthat he felt he could not possibly stand it any longer, let the cost be\r\nwhat it might. In this state of mind he met with Captain B. Only one\r\nobstacle stood in his way--material aid. It occurred to Robert that he\r\nhad frequent access to the money drawer, and often it contained the\r\nproceeds of fresh sales of flesh and blood; and he reasoned that if some\r\nof that would help him and his brother to freedom, there could be no\r\nharm in helping himself the first opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe captain was all ready, and provided he could get three passengers at\r\n$100 each he would set sail without much other freight. Of course he was\r\ntoo shrewd to get out papers for Philadelphia. That would betray him at\r\nonce. Washington or Baltimore, or even Wilmington, Del., were names\r\nwhich stood fair in the eyes of Virginia. Consequently, being able to\r\npack the fugitives away in a very private hole of his boat, and being\r\nonly bound for a Southern port, the captain was willing to risk his\r\nshare of the danger. \"Very well,\" said Robert, \"to-day I will please my\r\nmaster so well, that I will catch him at an unguarded moment, and will\r\nask him for a pass to go to a ball to-night (slave-holders love to see\r\ntheir slaves fiddling and dancing of nights), and as I shall be leaving\r\nin a hurry, I will take a grab from the day's sale, and when Slater\r\nhears of me again, I will be in Canada.\" So after having attended to all\r\nhis disagreeable duties, he made his \"grab,\" and got a hand full. He did\r\nnot know, however, how it would hold out. That evening, instead of\r\nparticipating with the gay dancers, he was just one degree lower down\r\nthan the regular bottom of Captain B's. deck, with several hundred\r\ndollars in his pocket, after paying the worthy captain one hundred each\r\nfor himself and his brother, besides making the captain an additional\r\npresent of nearly one hundred. Wind and tide were now what they prayed\r\nfor to speed on the U.G.R.R. schooner, until they might reach the depot\r\nat Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe Richmond _Dispatch_, an enterprising paper in the interest of\r\nslaveholders, which came daily to the Committee, was received in advance\r\nof the passengers, when lo! and behold, in turning to the interesting\r\ncolumn containing the elegant illustrations of \"runaway negroes,\" it was\r\nseen that the unfortunate Slater had \"lost $1500 in North Carolina\r\nmoney, and also his dark orange-colored, intelligent, and good-looking\r\nturnkey, Bob.\" \"Served him right, it is no stealing for one piece of\r\nproperty to go off with another piece,\" reasoned a member of the\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\nIn a couple of days after the Dispatch brought the news, the three\r\nU.G.R.R. passengers were safely landed at the usual place, and so\r\naccurate were the descriptions in the paper, that, on first seeing them,\r\nthe Committee recognized them instantly, and, without any previous\r\nceremonies, read to them the advertisement relative to the \"$1500 in\r\nN.C. money, &c.,\" and put the question to them direct: \"Are you the\r\nones?\" \"We are,\" they owned up without hesitation. The Committee did not\r\nsee a dollar of their money, but understood they had about $900, after\r\npaying the captain; while Bob considered he made a \"very good grab,\" he\r\ndid not admit that the amount advertised was correct. After a reasonable\r\ntime for recruiting, having been so long in the hole of the vessel, they\r\ntook their departure for Canada.\r\n\r\nFrom Joseph, the elder brother, is appended a short letter, announcing\r\ntheir arrival and condition under the British Lion--\r\n\r\n\r\n    SAINT CATHARINE, April 16, 1855.\r\n\r\n    MR. WILLIAM STILL, DEAR SIR:--Your letter of date April 7th I\r\n    have just got, it had been opened before it came to me. I have\r\n    not received any other letter from you and can get no account of\r\n    them in the Post Office in this place, I am well and have got a\r\n    good situation in this city and intend staying here. I should be\r\n    very glad to hear from you as soon as convenient and also from\r\n    all of my friends near you. My Brother is also at work with me\r\n    and doing well.\r\n\r\n    There is nothing here that would interest you in the way of\r\n    news. There is a Masonic Lodge of our people and two churches\r\n    and societys here and some other institutions for our benefit.\r\n    Be kind enough to send a few lines to the Lady spoken of for\r\n    that mocking bird and much oblige me. Write me soon and believe\r\n    me your obedient Serv't\r\n\r\n    Love & respects to Lady and daughter\r\n\r\n    JOSEPH ROBINSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs well as writing to a member of the Committee, Joe and Bob had the\r\nassurance to write back to the trader and oyster-house keeper. In their\r\nletter they stated that they had arrived safely in Canada, and were\r\nhaving good times,--in the eating line had an abundance of the\r\nbest,--also had very choice wines and brandies, which they supposed that\r\nthey (trader and oyster-house keeper) would give a great deal to have a\r\n\"smack at.\" And then they gave them a very cordial invitation to make\r\nthem a visit, and suggested that the quickest way they could come, would\r\nbe by telegraph, which they admitted was slightly dangerous, and without\r\nfirst greasing themselves, and then hanging on very fast, the journey\r\nmight not prove altogether advantageous to them. This was wormwood and\r\ngall to the trader and oyster-house man. A most remarkable coincidence\r\nwas that, about the time this letter was received in Richmond, the\r\ncaptain who brought away the three passengers, made it his business for\r\nsome reason or other, to call at the oyster-house kept by the owner of\r\nJoe, and while there, this letter was read and commented on in torrents\r\nof Billingsgate phrases; and the trader told the captain that he would\r\ngive him \"two thousand dollars if he would get them;\" finally he told\r\nhim he would \"give every cent they would bring, which would be much over\r\n$2000,\" as they were \"so very likely.\" How far the captain talked\r\napprovingly, he did not exactly tell the Committee, but they guessed he\r\ntalked strong Democratic doctrine to them under the frightful\r\ncircumstances. But he was good at concealing his feelings, and obviously\r\nmanaged to avoid suspicion.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE SOLOMON, DANIEL NEALL, BENJAMIN R. FLETCHER AND MARIA DORSEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above representatives of the unrequited laborers of the South fled\r\ndirectly from Washington, D.C. Nothing remarkable was discovered in\r\ntheir stories of slave life; their narratives will therefore be brief.\r\n\r\nGeorge Solomon was owned by Daniel Minor, of Moss Grove, Va. George was\r\nabout thirty-three years of age; mulatto, intelligent, and of\r\nprepossessing appearance. His old master valued George's services very\r\nhighly, and had often declared to others, as well as to George himself,\r\nthat without him he should hardly know how to manage. And frequently\r\nGeorge was told by the old master that at his \"death he was not to be a\r\nslave any longer, as he would have provision made in his will for his\r\nfreedom.\" For a long time this old story was clung to pretty faithfully\r\nby George, but his \"old master hung on too long,\" consequently George's\r\npatience became exhausted. And as he had heard a good deal about Canada,\r\nU.G.R.R., and the Abolitionists, he concluded that it would do no harm\r\nto hint to a reliable friend or two the names of these hard places and\r\nbad people, to see what impression would be made on their minds; in\r\nshort, to see if they were ready to second a motion to get rid of\r\nbondage. In thus opening his mind to his friends, he soon found a\r\nwilling accord in each of their hearts, and they put their heads\r\ntogether to count up the cost and to fix a time for leaving Egypt and\r\nthe host of Pharaoh to do their own \"hewing of wood and drawing of\r\nwater.\" Accordingly George, Daniel, Benjamin and Maria, all of one heart\r\nand mind, one \"Saturday night\" resolved that the next Sunday should find\r\nthem on the U.G.R.R., with their faces towards Canada.\r\n\r\nDaniel was young, only twenty-three, good looking, and half white, with\r\na fair share of intelligence. As regards his slave life, he acknowledged\r\nthat he had not had it very rough as a general thing; nevertheless, he\r\nwas fully persuaded that he had \"as good a right to his freedom\" as his\r\n\"master had to his,\" and that it was his duty to contend for it.\r\n\r\nBenjamin was twenty-seven years of age, small of stature, dark\r\ncomplexion, of a pleasant countenance, and quite smart. He testified,\r\nthat \"ill-treatment from his master,\" Henry Martin, who would give him\r\n\"no chance at all,\" was the cause of his leaving. He left a brother and\r\nsister, belonging to Martin, besides he left two other sisters in\r\nbondage, Louisa and Letty, but his father and mother were both dead.\r\nTherefore, the land of slave-whips and auction-blocks had no charms for\r\nhim. He loved his sisters, but he knew if he could not protect himself,\r\nmuch less could he protect them. So he concluded to bid them adieu\r\nforever in this world.\r\n\r\nTurning from the three male companions for the purpose of finding a\r\nbrief space for Maria, it will be well to state here that females in\r\nattempting to escape from a life of bondage undertook three times the\r\nrisk of failure that males were liable to, not to mention the additional\r\ntrials and struggles they had to contend with. In justice, therefore, to\r\nthe heroic female who was willing to endure the most extreme suffering\r\nand hardship for freedom, double honors were due.\r\n\r\nMaria, the heroine of the party, was about forty years of age, chestnut\r\ncolor, medium size, and possessed of a good share of common sense. She\r\nwas owned by George Parker. As was a common thing with slave-holders,\r\nMaria had found her owners hard to please, and quite often, without the\r\nslightest reason, they would threaten to \"sell or make a change.\" These\r\nthreats only made matters worse, or rather it only served to nerve Maria\r\nfor the conflict. The party walked almost the entire distance from\r\nWashington to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime George Parker, the so-called owner of Daniel and Maria,\r\nhurriedly rushed their good names into the \"Baltimore Sun,\" after the\r\nfollowing manner--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD.--Ranaway from my house on Saturday\r\n    night, August 30, my negro man 'Daniel,' twenty-five years of\r\n    age, bright yellow mulatto, thick set and stout made.\r\n\r\n    Also, my negro woman, 'Maria,' forty years of age, bright\r\n    mulatto. The above reward will be paid if delivered in\r\n    Washington city. GEORGE PARKER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this advertisement was in the Baltimore papers, doubtless these\r\nnoble passengers were enjoying the hospitalities of the Vigilance\r\nCommittee, and finally a warm reception in Canada, by which they were\r\ngreatly pleased. Of Benjamin and Daniel, the subjoined letter from Rev.\r\nH. Wilson is of importance in the way of throwing light upon their\r\nwhereabouts in Canada:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ST. CATHARINE, C.W., Sept. 15th, 1856.\r\n\r\n    MR. WILLIAM STILL:--_Dear Sir_--Two young men arrived here on\r\n    Friday evening last from Washington, viz: Benjamin R. Fletcher\r\n    and Daniel Neall. Mr. Neall (or Neale) desires to have his box\r\n    of clothing forwarded on to him. It is at Washington in the care\r\n    of John Dade, a colored man, who lives at Doct. W.H. Gilman's,\r\n    who keeps an Apothecary store on the corner of 4-1/2 and\r\n    Pennsylvania Avenue. Mr. Dade is a slave, but a free dealer. You\r\n    will please write to John Dade, in the care of Doct. W.H.\r\n    Gilman, on behalf of Daniel Neale, but make use of the name of\r\n    George Harrison, instead of Neale, and Dade will understand it.\r\n    Please have John Dade direct the box by express to you in\r\n    Philadelphia; he has the means of paying the charges on it in\r\n    advance, as far as Philadelphia; and as soon as it comes, you\r\n    will please forward it on to my care at St. Catherine. Say to\r\n    John Dade, that George Harrison sends his love to his sister and\r\n    Uncle Allen Sims, and all inquiring friends. Mr. Fletcher and\r\n    Mr. Neale both send their respects to you, and I may add mine.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n\r\n    HIRAM WILSON.\r\n\r\n    P.S.--Mr. Benjamin R. Fletcher wishes to have Mr. Dade call on\r\n    his brother James, and communicate to him his affectionate\r\n    regards, and make known to him that he is safe, and cheerful and\r\n    happy. He desires his friends to know, through Dade, that he\r\n    found Mrs. Starke here, his brother Alfred's wife's sister; that\r\n    she is well, and living in St. Catharine, C.W., near Niagara\r\n    Palls.    H.W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY BOX BROWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVED BY ADAMS' EXPRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the name of Henry Box Brown has been echoed over the land for a\r\nnumber of years, and the simple facts connected with his marvelous\r\nescape from slavery in a box published widely through the medium of\r\nanti-slavery papers, nevertheless it is not unreasonable to suppose that\r\nvery little is generally known in relation to this case.\r\n\r\nBriefly, the facts are these, which doubtless have never before been\r\nfully published--\r\n\r\nBrown was a man of invention as well as a hero. In point of interest,\r\nhowever, his case is no more remarkable than many others. Indeed,\r\nneither before nor after escaping did he suffer one-half what many\r\nothers have experienced.\r\n\r\nHe was decidedly an unhappy piece of property in the city of Richmond,\r\nVa. In the condition of a slave he felt that it would be impossible for\r\nhim to remain. Full well did he know, however, that it was no holiday\r\ntask to escape the vigilance of Virginia slave-hunters, or the wrath of\r\nan enraged master for committing the unpardonable sin of attempting to\r\nescape to a land of liberty. So Brown counted well the cost before\r\nventuring upon this hazardous undertaking. Ordinary modes of travel he\r\nconcluded might prove disastrous to his hopes; he, therefore, hit upon a\r\nnew invention altogether, which was to have himself boxed up and\r\nforwarded to Philadelphia direct by express. The size of the box and how\r\nit was to be made to fit him most comfortably, was of his own ordering.\r\nTwo feet eight inches deep, two feet wide, and three feet long were the\r\nexact dimensions of the box, lined with baize. His resources with regard\r\nto food and water consisted of the following: One bladder of water and a\r\nfew small biscuits. His mechanical implement to meet the death-struggle\r\nfor fresh air, all told, was one large gimlet. Satisfied that it would\r\nbe far better to peril his life for freedom in this way than to remain\r\nunder the galling yoke of Slavery, he entered his box, which was safely\r\nnailed up and hooped with five hickory hoops, and was then addressed by\r\nhis next friend, James A. Smith, a shoe dealer, to Wm. H. Johnson, Arch\r\nstreet, Philadelphia, marked, \"This side up with care.\" In this\r\ncondition he was sent to Adams' Express office in a dray, and thence by\r\noverland express to Philadelphia. It was twenty-six hours from the time\r\nhe left Richmond until his arrival in the City of Brotherly Love. The\r\nnotice, \"This side up, &c.,\" did not avail with the different\r\nexpressmen, who hesitated not to handle the box in the usual rough\r\nmanner common to this class of men. For a while they actually had the\r\nbox upside down, and had him on his head for miles. A few days before he\r\nwas expected, certain intimation was conveyed to a member of the\r\nVigilance Committee that a box might be expected by the three o'clock\r\nmorning train from the South, which might contain a man. One of the most\r\nserious walks he ever took--and they had not been a few--to meet and\r\naccompany passengers, he took at half past two o'clock that morning to\r\nthe depot. Not once, but for more than a score of times, he fancied the\r\nslave would be dead. He anxiously looked while the freight was being\r\nunloaded from the cars, to see if he could recognize a box that might\r\ncontain a man; one alone had that appearance, and he confessed it really\r\nseemed as if there was the scent of death about it. But on inquiry, he\r\nsoon learned that it was not the one he was looking after, and he was\r\nfree to say he experienced a marked sense of relief. That same\r\nafternoon, however, he received from Richmond a telegram, which read\r\nthus, \"Your case of goods is shipped and will arrive to-morrow morning.\"\r\n\r\nAt this exciting juncture of affairs, Mr. McKim, who had been\r\nengineering this important undertaking, deemed it expedient to change\r\nthe programme slightly in one particular at least to insure greater\r\nsafety. Instead of having a member of the Committee go again to the\r\ndepot for the box, which might excite suspicion, it was decided that it\r\nwould be safest to have the express bring it direct to the Anti-Slavery\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\nBut all apprehension of danger did not now disappear, for there was no\r\nroom to suppose that Adams' Express office had any sympathy with the\r\nAbolitionist or the fugitive, consequently for Mr. McKim to appear\r\npersonally at the express office to give directions with reference to\r\nthe coming of a box from Richmond which would be directed to Arch\r\nstreet, and yet not intended for that street, but for the Anti-Slavery\r\noffice at 107 North Fifth street, it needed of course no great\r\ndiscernment to foresee that a step of this kind was wholly impracticable\r\nand that a more indirect and covert method would have to be adopted. In\r\nthis dreadful crisis Mr. McKim, with his usual good judgment and\r\nremarkably quick, strategical mind, especially in matters pertaining to\r\nthe U.G.R.R., hit upon the following plan, namely, to go to his friend,\r\nE.M. Davis,[A] who was then extensively engaged in mercantile business,\r\nand relate the circumstances. Having daily intercourse with said Adams'\r\nExpress office, and being well acquainted with the firm and some of the\r\ndrivers, Mr. Davis could, as Mr. McKim thought, talk about \"boxes,\r\nfreight, etc.,\" from any part of the country without risk. Mr. Davis\r\nheard Mr. McKim's plan and instantly approved of it, and was heartily at\r\nhis service.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: E.M. Davis was a member of the Executive Committee of the\r\nPennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society and a long-tried Abolitionist,\r\nson-in-law of James and Lucretia Mott.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RESURRECTION OF HENRY BOX BROWN.]\r\n\r\n\"Dan, an Irishman, one of Adams' Express drivers, is just the fellow to\r\ngo to the depot after the box,\" said Davis. \"He drinks a little too much\r\nwhiskey sometimes, but he will do anything I ask him to do, promptly and\r\nobligingly. I'll trust Dan, for I believe he is the very man.\" The\r\ndifficulty which Mr. McKim had been so anxious to overcome was thus\r\npretty well settled. It was agreed that Dan should go after the box next\r\nmorning before daylight and bring it to the Anti-Slavery office direct,\r\nand to make it all the more agreeable for Dan to get up out of his warm\r\nbed and go on this errand before day, it was decided that he should have\r\na five dollar gold piece for himself. Thus these preliminaries having\r\nbeen satisfactorily arranged, it only remained for Mr. Davis to see Dan\r\nand give him instructions accordingly, etc.\r\n\r\nNext morning, according to arrangement, the box was at the Anti-Slavery\r\noffice in due time. The witnesses present to behold the resurrection\r\nwere J.M. McKim, Professor C.D. Cleveland, Lewis Thompson, and the\r\nwriter.\r\n\r\nMr. McKim was deeply interested; but having been long identified with\r\nthe Anti-Slavery cause as one of its oldest and ablest advocates in the\r\ndarkest days of slavery and mobs, and always found by the side of the\r\nfugitive to counsel and succor, he was on this occasion perfectly\r\ncomposed.\r\n\r\nProfessor Cleveland, however, was greatly moved. His zeal and\r\nearnestness in the cause of freedom, especially in rendering aid to\r\npassengers, knew no limit. Ordinarily he could not too often visit these\r\ntravelers, shake them too warmly by the hand, or impart to them too\r\nfreely of his substance to aid them on their journey. But now his\r\nemotion was overpowering.\r\n\r\nMr. Thompson, of the firm of Merrihew & Thompson--about the only\r\nprinters in the city who for many years dared to print such incendiary\r\ndocuments as anti-slavery papers and pamphlets--one of the truest\r\nfriends of the slave, was composed and prepared to witness the scene.\r\n\r\nAll was quiet. The door had been safely locked. The proceedings\r\ncommenced. Mr. McKim rapped quietly on the lid of the box and called\r\nout, \"All right!\" Instantly came the answer from within, \"All right,\r\nsir!\"\r\n\r\nThe witnesses will never forget that moment. Saw and hatchet quickly had\r\nthe five hickory hoops cut and the lid off, and the marvellous\r\nresurrection of Brown ensued. Rising up in his box, he reached out his\r\nhand, saying, \"How do you do, gentlemen?\" The little assemblage hardly\r\nknew what to think or do at the moment. He was about as wet as if he had\r\ncome up out of the Delaware. Very soon he remarked that, before leaving\r\nRichmond he had selected for his arrival-hymn (if he lived) the Psalm\r\nbeginning with these words: \"_I waited patiently for the Lord, and He\r\nheard my prayer_.\" And most touchingly did he sing the psalm, much to\r\nhis own relief, as well as to the delight of his small audience.\r\n\r\nHe was then christened Henry Box Brown, and soon afterwards was sent to\r\nthe hospitable residence of James Mott and E.M. Davis, on Ninth street,\r\nwhere, it is needless to say, he met a most cordial reception from Mrs.\r\nLucretia Mott and her household. Clothing and creature comforts were\r\nfurnished in abundance, and delight and joy filled all hearts in that\r\nstronghold of philanthropy.\r\n\r\nAs he had been so long doubled up in the box he needed to promenade\r\nconsiderably in the fresh air, so James Mott put one of his broad-brim\r\nhats on his head and tendered him the hospitalities of his yard as well\r\nas his house, and while Brown promenaded the yard flushed with victory,\r\ngreat was the joy of his friends.\r\n\r\nAfter his visit at Mr. Mott's, he spent two days with the writer, and\r\nthen took his departure for Boston, evidently feeling quite conscious of\r\nthe wonderful feat he had performed, and at the same time it may be\r\nsafely said that those who witnessed this strange resurrection were not\r\nonly elated at his success, but were made to sympathize more deeply than\r\never before with the slave. Also the noble-hearted Smith who boxed him\r\nup was made to rejoice over Brown's victory, and was thereby encouraged\r\nto render similar service to two other young bondmen, who appealed to\r\nhim for deliverance. But, unfortunately, in this attempt the undertaking\r\nproved a failure. Two boxes containing the young men alluded to above,\r\nafter having been duly expressed and some distance on the road, were,\r\nthrough the agency of the telegraph, betrayed, and the heroic young\r\nfugitives were captured in their boxes and dragged back to hopeless\r\nbondage. Consequently, through this deplorable failure, Samuel A. Smith\r\nwas arrested, imprisoned, and was called upon to suffer severely, as may\r\nbe seen from the subjoined correspondence, taken from the New York\r\nTribune soon after his release from the penitentiary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DELIVERER OF BOX BROWN--MEETING OF THE COLORED CITIZENS OF\r\nPHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Correspondence of the N.Y. Tribune.]\r\n\r\n    PHILADELPHIA, Saturday, July 5, 1856.\r\n\r\n    Samuel A. Smith, who boxed up Henry Box Brown in Richmond, Va.,\r\n    and forwarded him by overland express to Philadelphia, and who\r\n    was arrested and convicted, eight years ago, for boxing up two\r\n    other slaves, also directed to Philadelphia, having served out\r\n    his imprisonment in the Penitentiary, was released on the 18th\r\n    ultimo, and arrived in this city on the 21st.\r\n\r\n    Though he lost all his property; though he was refused witnesses\r\n    on his trial (no officer could be found, who would serve a\r\n    summons on a witness); though for five long months, in hot\r\n    weather, he was kept heavily chained in a cell four by eight\r\n    feet in dimensions; though he received five dreadful stabs,\r\n    aimed at his heart, by a bribed assassin, nevertheless he still\r\n    rejoices in the motives which prompted him to \"undo the heavy\r\n    burdens, and let the oppressed go free.\" Having resided nearly\r\n    all his life in the South, where he had traveled and seen much\r\n    of the \"peculiar institution,\" and had witnessed the most horrid\r\n    enormities inflicted upon the slave, whose cries were ever\r\n    ringing in his ears, and for whom he had the warmest sympathy,\r\n    Mr. Smith could not refrain from believing that the black man,\r\n    as well as the white, had God-given rights. Consequently, he was\r\n    not accustomed to shed tears when a poor creature escaped ftom\r\n    his \"kind master;\" nor was he willing to turn a deaf ear to his\r\n    appeals and groans, when he knew he was thirsting for freedom.\r\n    From 1828 up to the day he was incarcerated, many had sought his\r\n    aid and counsel, nor had they sought in vain. In various places\r\n    he operated with success. In Richmond, however, it seemed\r\n    expedient to invent a new plan for certain emergencies, hence\r\n    the Box and Express plan was devised, at the instance of a few\r\n    heroic slaves, who had manifested their willingness to die in a\r\n    box, on the road to liberty, rather than continue longer under\r\n    the yoke. But these heroes fell into the power of their enemies.\r\n    Mr. Smith had not been long in the Penitentiary before he had\r\n    fully gained the esteem and confidence of the Superintendent and\r\n    other officers. Finding him to be humane and\r\n    generous-hearted--showing kindness toward all, especially in\r\n    buying bread, &c., for the starving prisoners, and by a timely\r\n    note of warning, which had saved the life of one of the keepers,\r\n    for whose destruction a bold plot had been arranged--the\r\n    officers felt disposed to show him such favors as the law would\r\n    allow. But their good intentions were soon frustrated. The\r\n    Inquisition (commonly called the Legislature), being in session\r\n    in Richmond, hearing that the Superintendent had been speaking\r\n    well of Smith, and circulating a petition for his pardon,\r\n    indignantly demanded to know if the rumor was well founded. Two\r\n    weeks were spent by the Inquisition, and many witnesses were\r\n    placed upon oath, to solemnly testify in the matter. One of the\r\n    keepers swore that his life had been saved by Smith. Col.\r\n    Morgan, the Superintendent, frequently testified in writing and\r\n    verbally to Smith's good deportment; acknowledging that he had\r\n    circulated petitions, &c.; and took the position, that he\r\n    sincerely believed, that it would be to the interest of the\r\n    institution to pardon him; calling the attention of the\r\n    Inquisition, at the same time, to the fact, that not\r\n    unfrequently pardons had been granted to criminals, under\r\n    sentence of death, for the most cold-blooded murder, to say\r\n    nothing of other gross crimes. The effort for pardon was soon\r\n    abandoned, for the following reason given by the Governor: \"I\r\n    can't, and I won't pardon him!\"\r\n\r\n    In view of the unparalleled injustice which Mr. S. had suffered,\r\n    as well as on account of the aid he had rendered to the slaves,\r\n    on his arrival in this city the colored citizens of Philadelphia\r\n    felt that he was entitled to sympathy and aid, and straightway\r\n    invited him to remain a few days, until arrangements could be\r\n    made for a mass meeting to receive him. Accordingly, on last\r\n    Monday evening, a mass meeting convened in the Israel church,\r\n    and the Rev. Wm. T. Catto was called to the chair, and Wm. Still\r\n    was appointed secretary. The chairman briefly stated the object\r\n    of the meeting. Having lived in the South, he claimed to know\r\n    something of the workings of the oppressive system of slavery\r\n    generally, and declared that, notwithstanding the many exposures\r\n    of the evil which came under his own observation, the most vivid\r\n    descriptions fell far short of the realities his own eyes had\r\n    witnessed. He then introduced Mr. Smith, who arose and in a\r\n    plain manner briefly told his story, assuring the audience that\r\n    he had always hated slavery, and had taken great pleasure in\r\n    helping many out of it, and though he had suffered much\r\n    physically and pecuniarily for the cause' sake, yet he murmured\r\n    not, but rejoiced in what he had done. After taking his seat,\r\n    addresses were made by the Rev. S. Smith, Messrs. Kinnard,\r\n    Brunner, Bradway, and others. The following preamble and\r\n    resolutions were adopted--\r\n\r\n\r\n        WHEREAS, We, the colored citizens of Philadelphia, have\r\n        among us Samuel A. Smith, who was incarcerated over\r\n        seven years in the Richmond Penitentiary, for doing an\r\n        act that was honorable to his feelings and his sense of\r\n        justice and humanity, therefore,\r\n\r\n        _Resolved_, That we welcome him to this city as a martyr\r\n        to the cause of Freedom.\r\n\r\n        _Resolved_, That we heartily tender him our gratitude\r\n        for the good he has done to our suffering race.\r\n\r\n        _Resolved_, That we sympathize with him in his losses\r\n        and sufferings in the cause of the poor, down-trodden\r\n        slave.\r\n\r\n        W.S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring his stay in Philadelphia, on this occasion, he stopped for about\r\na fortnight with the writer, and it was most gratifying to learn from\r\nhim that he was no new worker on the U.G.R.R. But that he had long hated\r\nslavery thoroughly, and although surrounded with perils on every side,\r\nhe had not failed to help a poor slave whenever the opportunity was\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nPecuniary aid, to some extent, was rendered him in this city, for which\r\nhe was grateful, and after being united in marriage, by Wm. H. Furness,\r\nD.D., to a lady who had remained faithful to him through all his sore\r\ntrials and sufferings, he took his departure for Western New York, with\r\na good conscience and an unshaken faith in the belief that in aiding his\r\nfellow-man to freedom he had but simply obeyed the word of Him who\r\ntaught man to do unto others as he would be done by.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIAL OF THE EMANCIPATORS OF COL. J.H. WHEELER'S SLAVES, JANE JOHNSON\r\nAND HER TWO LITTLE BOYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong other duties devolving on the Vigilance Committee when hearing of\r\nslaves brought into the State by their owners, was immediately to inform\r\nsuch persons that as they were not fugitives, but were brought into the\r\nState by their masters, they were entitled to their freedom without\r\nanother moment's service, and that they could have the assistance of the\r\nCommittee and the advice of counsel without charge, by simply availing\r\nthemselves of these proffered favors.\r\n\r\nMany slave-holders fully understood the law in this particular, and were\r\nalso equally posted with regard to the vigilance of abolitionists.\r\nConsequently they avoided bringing slaves beyond Mason and Dixon's Line\r\nin traveling North. But some slave-holders were not thus mindful of the\r\nlaws, or were too arrogant to take heed, as may be seen in the case of\r\nColonel John H. Wheeler, of North Carolina, the United States Minister\r\nto Nicaragua. In passing through Philadelphia from Washington, one very\r\nwarm July day in 1855, accompanied by three of his slaves, his high\r\nofficial equilibrium, as well as his assumed rights under the\r\nConstitution, received a terrible shock at the hands of the Committee.\r\nTherefore, for the readers of these pages, and in order to completely\r\nillustrate the various phases of the work of the Committee in the days\r\nof Slavery, this case, selected from many others, is a fitting one.\r\nHowever, for more than a brief recital of some of the more prominent\r\nincidents, it will not be possible to find room in this volume. And,\r\nindeed, the necessity of so doing is precluded by the fact that Mr.\r\nWilliamson in justice to himself and the cause of freedom, with great\r\npains and singular ability, gathered the most important facts bearing on\r\nhis memorable trial and imprisonment, and published them in a neat\r\nvolume for historical reference.\r\n\r\nIn order to bring fully before the reader the beginning of this\r\ninteresting and exciting case, it seems only necessary to publish the\r\nsubjoined letter, written by one of the actors in the drama, and\r\naddressed to the New York Tribune, and an additional paragraph which may\r\nbe requisite to throw light on a special point, which Judge Kane decided\r\nwas concealed in the \"obstinate\" breast of Passmore Williamson, as said\r\nWilliamson persistently refused before the said Judge's court, to own\r\nthat he had a knowledge of the mystery in question. After which, a brief\r\nglance at some of the more important points of the case must suffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER COPIED FROM THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Correspondence of The N.Y. Tribune.]\r\n\r\n    PHILADELPHIA, Monday, July 30, 1855.\r\n\r\n    As the public have not been made acquainted with the facts and\r\n    particulars respecting the agency of Mr. Passmore Williamson and\r\n    others, in relation to the slave case now agitating this city,\r\n    and especially as the poor slave mother and her two sons have\r\n    been so grossly misrepresented, I deem it my duty to lay the\r\n    facts before you, for publication or otherwise, as you may think\r\n    proper.\r\n\r\n    On Wednesday afternoon, week, at 4-1/2 o'clock, the following\r\n    note was placed in my hands by a colored boy whom I had never\r\n    before seen, to my recollection:\r\n\r\n    \"MR. STILL--_Sir_: Will you come down to Bloodgood's Hotel as\r\n    soon as possible--as there are three fugitive slaves here and\r\n    they want liberty. Their master is here with them, on his way to\r\n    New York.\"\r\n\r\n    The note was without date, and the signature so indistinctly\r\n    written as not to be understood by me, having evidently been\r\n    penned in a moment of haste.\r\n\r\n    Without delay I ran with the note to Mr. P. Williamson's office,\r\n    Seventh and Arch, found him at his desk, and gave it to him, and\r\n    after reading it, he remarked that he could not go down, as he\r\n    had to go to Harrisburg that night on business--but he advised\r\n    me to go, and to get the names of the slave-holder and the\r\n    slaves, in order to telegraph to New York to have them arrested\r\n    there, as no time remained to procure a writ of habeas corpus\r\n    here.\r\n\r\n    I could not have been two minutes in Mr. W.'s office before\r\n    starting in haste for the wharf. To my surprise, however, when I\r\n    reached the wharf, there I found Mr. W., his mind having\r\n    undergone a sudden change; he was soon on the spot.\r\n\r\n    I saw three or four colored persons in the hall at Bloodgood's,\r\n    none of whom I recognized except the boy who brought me the\r\n    note. Before having time for making inquiry some one said they\r\n    had gone on board the boat. \"Get their description,\" said Mr. W.\r\n    I instantly inquired of one of the colored persons for the\r\n    desired description, and was told that she was \"a tall, dark\r\n    woman, with two little boys.\"\r\n\r\n    Mr. W. and myself ran on board of the boat, looked among the\r\n    passengers on the first deck, but saw them not. \"They are up on\r\n    the second deck,\" an unknown voice uttered. In a second we were\r\n    in their presence. We approached the anxious-looking\r\n    slave-mother with her two boys on her left-hand; close on her\r\n    right sat an ill-favored white man having a cane in his hand\r\n    which I took to be a sword-cane. (As to its being a sword-cane,\r\n    however, I might have been mistaken.)\r\n\r\n    The first words to the mother were: \"Are you traveling?\" \"Yes,\"\r\n    was the prompt answer. \"With whom?\" She nodded her head toward\r\n    the ill-favored man, signifying with him. Fidgeting on his seat,\r\n    he said something, exactly what I do not now recollect. In reply\r\n    I remarked: \"Do they belong to you, Sir?\" \"Yes, they are in my\r\n    charge,\" was his answer. Turning from him to the mother and her\r\n    sons, in substance, and word for word, as near as I can\r\n    remember, the following remarks were earnestly though calmly\r\n    addressed by the individuals who rejoiced to meet them on free\r\n    soil, and who felt unmistakably assured that they were justified\r\n    by the laws of Pennsylvania as well as the Law of God, in\r\n    informing them of their rights:\r\n\r\n    \"You are entitled to your freedom according to the laws of\r\n    Pennsylvania, having been brought into the State by your owner.\r\n    If you prefer freedom to slavery, as we suppose everybody does,\r\n    you have the chance to accept it now. Act calmly--don't be\r\n    frightened by your master--you are as much entitled to your\r\n    freedom as we are, or as he is--be determined and you need have\r\n    no fears but that you will be protected by the law. Judges have\r\n    time and again decided cases in this city and State similar to\r\n    yours in favor of freedom! Of course, if you want to remain a\r\n    slave with your master, we cannot force you to leave; we only\r\n    want to make you sensible of your rights. _Remember, if you lose\r\n    this chance you may never get such another,\" etc_.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: RESCUE OF JANE JOHNSON AND HER CHILDREN.]\r\n\r\n    This advice to the woman was made in the hearing of a number of\r\n    persons present, white and colored; and one elderly white\r\n    gentleman of genteel address, who seemed to take much interest\r\n    in what was going on, remarked that they would have the same\r\n    chance for their freedom in New Jersey and New York as they then\r\n    had--seeming to sympathize with the woman, etc.\r\n\r\n    During the few moments in which the above remarks were made, the\r\n    slaveholder frequently interrupted--said she understood all\r\n    about the laws making her free, and her right to leave if she\r\n    wanted to; but contended that she did not want to leave--that\r\n    she was on a visit to New York to see her friends--afterward\r\n    _wished to return to her three children whom she left in\r\n    Virginia, from whom it would be_ HARD _to separate her_.\r\n    Furthermore, he diligently tried to constrain her to say that\r\n    she did not want to be interfered with--that she wanted to go\r\n    with him--that she was on a visit to New York--had children in\r\n    the South, etc.; but the woman's desire to be free was\r\n    altogether too strong to allow her to make a single\r\n    acknowledgment favorable to his wishes in the matter. On the\r\n    contrary, she repeatedly said, distinctly and firmly, \"_I am not\r\n    free, but I want my freedom_--ALWAYS _wanted to be free!! but he\r\n    holds me_.\"\r\n\r\n    While the slaveholder claimed that she belonged to him, he said\r\n    _that she was free_! Again he said that he was _going to give\r\n    her her freedom_, etc. When his eyes would be off of hers, such\r\n    eagerness as her looks expressed, indicative of her entreaty\r\n    that we would not forsake her and her little ones in their\r\n    weakness, it had never been my lot to witness before, under any\r\n    circumstances.\r\n\r\n    The last bell tolled! The last moment for further delay passed!\r\n    The arm of the woman being slightly touched, accompanied with\r\n    the word, \"Come!\" she instantly arose. \"Go along--go along!\"\r\n    said some, who sympathized, to the boys, at the same time taking\r\n    hold of their arms. By this time the parties were fairly moving\r\n    toward the stairway leading to the deck below. Instantly on\r\n    their starting, the slave-holder rushed at the woman and her\r\n    children, to prevent their leaving; and, if I am not mistaken,\r\n    he simultaneously took hold of the woman and Mr. Williamson,\r\n    which resistance on his part caused Mr. W. to take hold of him\r\n    and set him aside quickly.\r\n\r\n    The passengers were looking on all around, but none interfered\r\n    in behalf of the slaveholder except one man, whom I took to be\r\n    another slaveholder. He said harshly, \"Let them alone; they are\r\n    his _property_!'\" The youngest boy, about 7 years of age--too\r\n    young to know what these things meant--cried \"Massa John! Massa\r\n    John!\" The elder boy, 11 years of age, took the matter more\r\n    dispassionately, and the mother _quite calmly_. The mother and\r\n    her sympathizers all moved down the stairs together in the\r\n    presence of quite a number of spectators on the first deck and\r\n    on the wharf, all of whom, as far as I was able to discern,\r\n    seemed to look upon the whole affair with the greatest\r\n    indifference. The woman and children were assisted, but not\r\n    forced to leave. Nor were there any violence or threatenings as\r\n    I saw or heard. The only words that I heard from any one of an\r\n    objectionable character, were: \"Knock him down; knock him down!\"\r\n    but who uttered it or who was meant I knew not, nor have I since\r\n    been informed. However, if it was uttered by a colored man, I\r\n    regret it, as there was not the slightest cause for such\r\n    language, especially as the sympathies of the spectators and\r\n    citizens seemed to justify the course pursued.\r\n\r\n    While passing off of the wharf and down Delaware-avenue to Dock\r\n    st., and up Dock to Front, where a carriage was procured, the\r\n    slaveholder and one police officer were of the party, if no\r\n    more.\r\n\r\n    The youngest boy on being put in the carriage was told that he\r\n    was \"a fool for crying so after 'Massa John,' who would sell him\r\n    if he ever caught him.\" Not another whine was heard on the\r\n    subject.\r\n\r\n    The carriage drove down town slowly, the horses being fatigued\r\n    and the weather intensely hot; the inmates were put out on Tenth\r\n    street--not at any house--after which they soon found hospitable\r\n    friends and quietude. The excitement of the moment having passed\r\n    by, the mother _seemed very cheerful, and rejoiced greatly that\r\n    herself and boys had been, as she thought, so \"providentially\r\n    delivered from the house of bondage_!\" For the first time in her\r\n    life she could look upon herself and children and feel free!\r\n\r\n    Having felt the iron in her heart for the best half of her\r\n    days--having been sold with her children on the auction\r\n    block--having had one of her children sold far away from her\r\n    without hope of her seeing him again--she very naturally and\r\n    wisely concluded to go to Canada, fearing if she remained in\r\n    this city--as some assured her she could do with entire\r\n    safety--that she might again find herself in the clutches of the\r\n    tyrant from whom she had fled.\r\n\r\n    A few items of what she related concerning the character of her\r\n    master may be interesting to the reader--\r\n\r\n    Within the last two years he had sold all his slaves--between\r\n    thirty and forty in number--having purchased the present ones in\r\n    that space of time. She said that before leaving Washington,\r\n    coming on the cars, and at his father-in-law's in this city, a\r\n    number of persons had told him that in bringing his slaves into\r\n    Pennsylvania they would be free. When told at his\r\n    father-in-law's, as she overheard it, that he \"could not have\r\n    done a worse thing,\" &c., he replied that \"Jane would not leave\r\n    him.\"\r\n\r\n    As much, however, as he affected to have such implicit\r\n    confidence in Jane, he scarcely allowed her to be out of his\r\n    presence a moment while in this city. To use Jane's own\r\n    language, he was \"on her heels every minute,\" fearing that some\r\n    one might get to her ears the sweet music of freedom. By the\r\n    way, Jane had it deep in her heart before leaving the South, and\r\n    was bent on succeeding in New York, if disappointed in\r\n    Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n    At Bloodgood's, after having been belated and left by the 2\r\n    o'clock train, while waiting for the 5 o'clock line, his\r\n    appetite tempted her \"master\" to take a hasty dinner. So after\r\n    placing Jane where he thought she would be pretty secure from\r\n    \"evil communications\" from the colored waiters, and after giving\r\n    her a double counselling, he made his way to the table; remained\r\n    but a little while, however, before leaving to look after Jane;\r\n    finding her composed, looking over a bannister near where he\r\n    left her, he returned to the table again and finished his meal.\r\n\r\n    But, alas, for the slave-holder! Jane had her \"top eye open,\"\r\n    and in that brief space had appealed to the sympathies of a\r\n    person whom she ventured to trust, saying, \"I and my children\r\n    are slaves, and we want liberty!\" I am not certain, but suppose\r\n    that person, in the goodness of his heart, was the cause of the\r\n    note being sent to the Anti-Slavery office, and hence the\r\n    result.\r\n\r\n    As to her going on to New York to see her friends, and wishing\r\n    to return to her three children in the South, and his going to\r\n    free her, &c., Jane declared repeatedly and very positively,\r\n    that there was not a particle of truth in what her master said\r\n    on these points. The truth is she had not the slightest hope of\r\n    freedom through any act of his. She had only left one boy in the\r\n    South, who had been sold far away, where she scarcely ever heard\r\n    from him, indeed never expected to see him any more.\r\n\r\n    In appearance Jane is tall and well formed, high and large\r\n    forehead, of genteel manners, chestnut color, and seems to\r\n    possess, naturally, uncommon good sense, though of course she\r\n    has never been allowed to read.\r\n\r\n    Thus I have given as truthful a report as I am capable of doing,\r\n    of Jane and the circumstances connected with her deliverance.\r\n\r\n    W. STILL.\r\n\r\n    P.S.--Of the five colored porters who promptly appeared, with\r\n    warm hearts throbbing in sympathy with the mother and her\r\n    children, too much cannot be said in commendation. In the\r\n    present case they acted nobly, whatever may be said of their\r\n    general character, of which I know nothing. How human beings,\r\n    who have ever tasted oppression, could have acted differently\r\n    under the circumstances I cannot conceive.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mystery alluded to, which the above letter did not contain, and\r\nwhich the court failed to make Mr. Williamson reveal, might have been\r\ntruthfully explained in these words. The carriage was procured at the\r\nwharf, while Col. Wheeler and Mr. Williamson were debating the question\r\nrelative to the action of the Committee, and at that instant, Jane and\r\nher two boys were invited into it and accompanied by the writer, who\r\nprocured it, were driven down town, and on Tenth Street, below Lombard,\r\nthe inmates were invited out of it, and the said conductor paid the\r\ndriver and discharged him. For prudential reasons he took them to a\r\ntemporary resting-place, where they could tarry until after dark; then\r\nthey were invited to his own residence, where they were made welcome,\r\nand in due time forwarded East. Now, what disposition was made of them\r\nafter they had left the wharf, while Williamson and Wheeler were\r\ndiscussing matters--(as was clearly sworn to by Passmore, in his answer\r\nto the writ of Habeas Corpus)--he Williamson did not know. That evening,\r\nbefore seeing the member of the Committee, with whom he acted in concert\r\non the boat, and who had entire charge of Jane and her boys, he left for\r\nHarrisburg, to fulfill business engagements. The next morning his father\r\n(Thomas Williamson) brought the writ of Habeas Corpus (which had been\r\nserved at Passmore's office after he left) to the Anti-Slavery Office.\r\nIn his calm manner he handed it to the writer, at the same time\r\nremarking that \"Passmore had gone to Harrisburg,\" and added, \"thee had\r\nbetter attend to it\" (the writ). Edward Hopper, Esq., was applied to\r\nwith the writ, and in the absence of Mr. Williamson, appeared before the\r\ncourt, and stated \"that the writ had not been served, as Mr. W. was out\r\nof town,\" etc.\r\n\r\nAfter this statement, the Judge postponed further action until the next\r\nday. In the meanwhile, Mr. Williamson returned and found the writ\r\nawaiting him, and an agitated state of feeling throughout the city\r\nbesides. Now it is very certain, that he did not seek to know from those\r\nin the secret, where Jane Johnson and her boys were taken after they\r\nleft the wharf, or as to what disposition had been made of them, in any\r\nway; except to ask simply, \"are they safe?\" (and when told \"yes,\" he\r\nsmiled) consequently, he might have been examined for a week, by the\r\nmost skillful lawyer, at the Philadelphia bar, but he could not have\r\nanswered other than he did in making his return to the writ, before\r\nJudge Kane, namely: \"_That the persons named in the writ, nor either of\r\nthem, are now nor was at the time of issuing of the writ, or the\r\noriginal writ, or at any other time in the custody, power, or possession\r\nof the respondent, nor by him confined or restrained; wherefore he\r\ncannot have the bodies,\" etc._.\r\n\r\nThus, while Mr. W. was subjected to the severest trial of his devotion\r\nto Freedom, his noble bearing throughout, won for him the admiration and\r\nsympathy of the friends of humanity and liberty throughout the entire\r\nland, and in proof of his fidelity, he most cheerfully submitted to\r\nimprisonment rather than desert his principles. But the truth was not\r\nwanted in this instance by the enemies of Freedom; obedience to Slavery\r\nwas demanded to satisfy the South. The opportunity seemed favorable for\r\nteaching abolitionists and negroes, that they had no right to interfere\r\nwith a \"chivalrous southern gentleman,\" while passing through\r\nPhiladelphia with his slaves. Thus, to make an effective blow, all the\r\npro-slavery elements of Philadelphia were brought into action, and\r\nmatters looked for a time as though Slavery in this instance would have\r\neverything its own way. Passmore was locked up in prison on the flimsy\r\npretext of contempt of court, and true bills were found against him and\r\nhalf a dozen colored men, charging them with \"riot,\" \"forcible\r\nabduction,\" and \"assault and battery,\" and there was no lack of hard\r\nswearing on the part of Col. Wheeler and his pro-slavery sympathizers in\r\nsubstantiation of these grave charges. But the pro-slaveryites had\r\ncounted without their host--Passmore would not yield an inch, but stood\r\nas firmly by his principles in prison, as he did on the boat. Indeed, it\r\nwas soon evident, that his resolute course was bringing floods of\r\nsympathy from the ablest and best minds throughout the North. On the\r\nother hand, the occasion was rapidly awakening thousands daily, who had\r\nhitherto manifested little or no interest at all on the subject, to the\r\nwrongs of the slave.\r\n\r\nIt was soon discovered by the \"chivalry\" that keeping Mr. Williamson in\r\nprison would indirectly greatly aid the cause of Freedom--that every day\r\nhe remained would make numerous converts to the cause of liberty; that\r\nMr. Williamson was doing ten-fold more in prison for the cause of\r\nuniversal liberty than he could possibly do while pursuing his ordinary\r\nvocation.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the colored men under bonds, Col. Wheeler and his\r\nsatellites felt very confident that there was no room for them to\r\nescape. They must have had reason so to think, judging from the hard\r\nswearing they did, before the committing magistrate. Consequently, in\r\nthe order of events, while Passmore was still in prison, receiving\r\nvisits from hosts of friends, and letters of sympathy from all parts of\r\nthe North, William Still, William Curtis, James P. Braddock, John\r\nBallard, James Martin and Isaiah Moore, were brought into court for\r\ntrial. The first name on the list in the proceedings of the court was\r\ncalled up first.\r\n\r\nAgainst this individual, it was pretty well understood by the friends of\r\nthe slave, that no lack of pains and false swearing would be resorted to\r\non the part of Wheeler and his witnesses, to gain a verdict.\r\n\r\nMr. McKim and other noted abolitionists managing the defense, were\r\nequally alive to the importance of overwhelming the enemy in this\r\nparticular issue. The Hon. Charles Gibbons, was engaged to defend\r\nWilliam Still, and William S. Pierce, Esq., and William B. Birney, Esq.,\r\nthe other five colored defendants.\r\n\r\nIn order to make the victory complete, the anti-slavery friends deemed\r\nit of the highest importance to have Jane Johnson in court, to face her\r\nmaster, and under oath to sweep away his \"refuge of lies,\" with regard\r\nto her being \"abducted,\" and her unwillingness to \"leave her master,\"\r\netc. So Mr. McKim and the friends very privately arranged to have Jane\r\nJohnson on hand at the opening of the defense.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lucretia Mott, Mrs. McKim, Miss Sarah Pugh and Mrs. Plumly,\r\nvolunteered to accompany this poor slave mother to the court-house and\r\nto occupy seats by her side, while she should face her master, and\r\nboldly, on oath, contradict all his hard swearing. A better subject for\r\nthe occasion than Jane, could not have been desired. She entered the\r\ncourt room veiled, and of course was not known by the crowd, as pains\r\nhad been taken to keep the public in ignorance of the fact, that she was\r\nto be brought on to bear witness. So that, at the conclusion of the\r\nsecond witness on the part of the defense, \"Jane Johnson\" was called\r\nfor, in a shrill voice. Deliberately, Jane arose and answered, in a\r\nlady-like manner to her name, and was then the observed of all\r\nobservers. Never before had such a scene been witnessed in Philadelphia.\r\nIt was indescribable. Substantially, her testimony on this occasion, was\r\nin keeping with the subjoined affidavit, which was as follows--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"_State of New York, City and County of New York_.\r\n\r\n    \"Jane Johnson being sworn, makes oath and says--\r\n\r\n    \"My name is Jane--Jane Johnson; I was the slave of Mr. Wheeler\r\n    of Washington; he bought me and my two children, about two years\r\n    ago, of Mr. Cornelius Crew, of Richmond, Va.; my youngest child\r\n    is between six and seven years old, the other between ten and\r\n    eleven; I have one other child only, and he is in Richmond; I\r\n    have not seen him for about two years; never expect to see him\r\n    again; Mr. Wheeler brought me and my two children to\r\n    Philadelphia, on the way to Nicaragua, to wait on his wife; I\r\n    didn't want to go without my two children, and he consented to\r\n    take them; we came to Philadelphia by the cars; stopped at Mr.\r\n    Sully's, Mr. Wheeler's father-in-law, a few moments; then went\r\n    to the steamboat for New York at 2 o'clock, but were too late;\r\n    we went into Bloodgood's Hotel; Mr. Wheeler went to dinner; Mr.\r\n    Wheeler had told me in Washington to have nothing to say to\r\n    colored persons, and if any of them spoke to me, to say I was a\r\n    free woman traveling with a minister; we staid at Bloodgood's\r\n    till 5 o'clock; Mr. Wheeler kept his eye on me all the time\r\n    except when he was at dinner; he left his dinner to come and see\r\n    if I was safe, and then went back again; while he was at dinner,\r\n    I saw a colored woman and told her I was a slave woman, that my\r\n    master had told me not to speak to colored people, and that if\r\n    any of them spoke to me to say that I was free; but I am not\r\n    free; but I want to be free; she said: 'poor thing, I pity you;'\r\n    after that I saw a colored man and said the same thing to him,\r\n    he said he would telegraph to New York, and two men would meet\r\n    me at 9 o'clock and take me with them; after that we went on\r\n    board the boat, Mr. Wheeler sat beside me on the deck; I saw a\r\n    colored gentleman come on board, he beckoned to me; I nodded my\r\n    head, and could not go; Mr. Wheeler was beside me and I was\r\n    afraid; a white gentleman then came and said to Mr. Wheeler, 'I\r\n    want to speak to your servant, and tell her of her rights;' Mr.\r\n    Wheeler rose and said, 'If you have anything to say, say it to\r\n    me--she knows her rights;' the white gentleman asked me if I\r\n    wanted to be free; I said 'I do, but I belong to this gentleman\r\n    and I can't have it;' he replied, 'Yes, you can, come with us,\r\n    you are as free as your master, if you want your freedom come\r\n    now; if you go back to Washington you may never get it;' I rose\r\n    to go, Mr. Wheeler spoke, and said, 'I will give you your\r\n    freedom,' but he had never promised it before, and I knew he\r\n    would never give it to me; the white gentleman held out his hand\r\n    and I went toward him; I was ready for the word before it was\r\n    given me; I took the children by the hands, who both cried, for\r\n    they were frightened, but both stopped when they got on shore; a\r\n    colored man carried the little one, I led the other by the hand.\r\n    We walked down the street till we got to a hack; nobody forced\r\n    me away; nobody pulled me, and nobody led me; I went away of my\r\n    own free will; I always wished to be free and meant to be free\r\n    when I came North; I hardly expected it in Philadelphia, but I\r\n    thought I should get free in New York; I have been comfortable\r\n    and happy since I left Mr. Wheeler, and so are the children; I\r\n    don't want to go back; I could have gone in Philadelphia if I\r\n    had wanted to; I could go now; but I had rather die than go\r\n    back. I wish to make this statement before a magistrate, because\r\n    I understand that Mr. Williamson is in prison on my account, and\r\n    I hope the truth may be of benefit to him.\"\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: JANE JOHNSON]\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PASSMORE WILLIAMSON.]\r\n\r\n    JANE [her X mark.] JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt might have been supposed that her honest and straightforward\r\ntestimony would have been sufficient to cause even the most relentless\r\nslaveholder to abandon at once a pursuit so monstrous and utterly\r\nhopeless as Wheeler's was. But although he was sadly confused and put to\r\nshame, he hung on to the \"lost cause\" tenaciously. And his counsel,\r\nDavid Webster, Esq., and the United States District Attorney, Vandyke,\r\ncompletely imbued with the pro-slavery spirit, were equally as\r\nunyielding. And thus, with a zeal befitting the most worthy object\r\nimaginable, they labored with untiring effort to convict the colored\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nBy this policy, however, the counsel for the defense was doubly aroused.\r\nMr. Gibbons, in the most eloquent and indignant strains, perfectly\r\nannihilated the \"distinguished Colonel John H. Wheeler, United States\r\nMinister Plenipotentiary near the Island of Nicaragua,\" taking special\r\npains to ring the changes repeatedly on his long appellations. Mr.\r\nGibbons appeared to be precisely in the right mood to make himself\r\nsurpassingly forcible and eloquent, on whatever point of law he chose to\r\ntouch bearing on the case; or in whatever direction he chose to glance\r\nat the injustice and cruelty of the South. Most vividly did he draw the\r\ncontrast between the States of \"Georgia\" and \"Pennsylvania,\" with regard\r\nto the atrocious laws of Georgia. Scarcely less vivid is the impression\r\nafter a lapse of sixteen years, than when this eloquent speech was made.\r\nWith the District Attorney, Wm. B. Mann, Esq., and his Honor, Judge\r\nKelley, the defendants had no cause to complain. Throughout the entire\r\nproceedings, they had reason to feel, that neither of these officials\r\nsympathized in the least with Wheeler or Slavery. Indeed in the Judge's\r\ncharge and also in the District Attorney's closing speech the ring of\r\nfreedom could be distinctly heard--much more so than was agreeable to\r\nWheeler and his Pro-Slavery sympathizers. The case of Wm. Still ended in\r\nhis acquittal; the other five colored men were taken up in order. And it\r\nis scarcely necessary to say that Messrs. Peirce and Birney did full\r\njustice to all concerned. Mr. Peirce, especially, was one of the oldest,\r\nablest and most faithful lawyers to the slave of the Philadelphia Bar.\r\nHe never was known, it may safely be said, to hesitate in the darkest\r\ndays of Slavery to give his time and talents to the fugitive, even in\r\nthe most hopeless cases, and when, from the unpopularity of such a\r\ncourse, serious sacrifices would be likely to result. Consequently he\r\nwas but at home in this case, and most nobly did he defend his clients,\r\nwith the same earnestness that a man would defend his fireside against\r\nthe approach of burglars. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury\r\nreturned a verdict of \"not guilty,\" as to all the persons in the first\r\ncount, charging them with riot. In the second count, charging them with\r\n\"Assault and Battery\" (on Col. Wheeler) Ballard and Curtis were found\r\n\"guilty,\" the rest \"not guilty.\" The guilty were given about a week in\r\njail. Thus ended this act in the Wheeler drama.\r\n\r\nThe following extract is taken from the correspondence of the New York\r\nTribune touching Jane Johnson's presence in the court, and will be\r\ninteresting on that account:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"But it was a bold and perilous move on the part of her friends,\r\n    and the deepest apprehensions were felt for a while, for the\r\n    result. The United States Marshal was there with his warrant and\r\n    an extra force to execute it. The officers of the court and\r\n    other State officers were there to protect the witness and\r\n    vindicate the laws of the State. Vandyke, the United States\r\n    District Attorney, swore he would take her. The State officers\r\n    swore he should not, and for a while it seemed that nothing\r\n    could avert a bloody scene. It was expected that the conflict\r\n    would take place at the door, when she should leave the room, so\r\n    that when she and her friends went out, and for some time after,\r\n    the most intense suspense pervaded the court-room. She was,\r\n    however, allowed to enter the carriage that awaited her without\r\n    disturbance. She was accompanied by Mr. McKim, Secretary of the\r\n    Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society, Lucretia Mott and George\r\n    Corson, one of our most manly and intrepid police officers. The\r\n    carriage was followed by another filled with officers as a\r\n    guard; and thus escorted she was taken back in safety to the\r\n    house from which she had been brought. Her title to Freedom\r\n    under the laws of the State will hardly again be brought into\r\n    question.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Williamson was committed to prison by Judge Kane for contempt of\r\nCourt, on the 27th day of July, 1855, and was released on the 3d day of\r\nNovember the same year, having gained, in the estimation of the friends\r\nof Freedom every where, a triumph and a fame which but few men in the\r\ngreat moral battle for Freedom could claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARRIVALS OF A SINGLE MONTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIXTY PASSENGERS CAME IN ONE MONTH--TWENTY-EIGHT IN ONE ARRIVAL--GREAT\r\nPANIC AND INDIGNATION MEETING--INTERESTING CORRESPONDENCE FROM MASTERS\r\nAND FUGITIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great number of cases to be here noticed forbids more than a brief\r\nreference to each passenger. As they arrived in parties, their\r\nnarratives will be given in due order as found on the book of records:\r\n\r\nWilliam Griffen, Henry Moor, James Camper, Noah Ennells and Levin\r\nParker. This party came from Cambridge, Md.\r\n\r\nWilliam is thirty-four years of age, of medium size and substantial\r\nappearance. He fled from James Waters, Esq., a lawyer, living in\r\nCambridge. He was \"wealthy, close, and stingy,\" and owned nine head of\r\nslaves and a farm, on which William served. He was used very hard, which\r\nwas the cause of his escape, though the idea that he was entitled to his\r\nfreedom had been entertained for the previous twelve years. On preparing\r\nto take the Underground, he armed himself with a big butcher-knife, and\r\nresolved, if attacked, to make his enemies stand back. His master was a\r\nmember of the Methodist Church.\r\n\r\nHenry is tall, copper-colored, and about thirty years of age. He\r\ncomplained not so much of bad usage as of the utter distaste he had to\r\nworking all the time for the \"white people for nothing.\" He was also\r\ndecidedly of the opinion that every man should have his liberty. Four\r\nyears ago his wife was \"sold away to Georgia\" by her young master; since\r\nwhich time not a word had he heard of her. She left three children, and\r\nhe, in escaping, also had to leave them in the same hands that sold\r\ntheir mother. He was owned by Levin Dale, a farmer near Cambridge. Henry\r\nwas armed with a six-barreled revolver, a large knife, and a determined\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nJames is twenty-four years of age, quite black, small size, keen look,\r\nand full of hope for the \"best part of Canada.\" He fled from Henry\r\nHooper, \"a dashing young man and a member of the Episcopal Church.\" Left\r\nbecause he \"did not enjoy privileges\" as he wished to do. He was armed\r\nwith two pistols and a dirk to defend himself.\r\n\r\nNoah is only nineteen, quite dark, well-proportioned, and possessed of a\r\nfair average of common sense. He was owned by \"Black-head Bill LeCount,\"\r\nwho \"followed drinking, chewing tobacco, catching 'runaways,' and\r\nhanging around the court-house.\" However, he owned six head of slaves,\r\nand had a \"rough wife,\" who belonged to the Methodist Church. Left\r\nbecause he \"expected every day to be sold\"--his master being largely in\r\n\"debt.\" Brought with him a butcher-knife.\r\n\r\nLevin is twenty-two, rather short built, medium size and well colored.\r\nHe fled from Lawrence G. Colson, \"a very bad man, fond of drinking,\r\ngreat to fight and swear, and hard to please.\" His mistress was \"real\r\nrough; very bad, worse than he was as 'fur' as she could be.\" Having\r\nbeen stinted with food and clothing and worked hard, was the apology\r\noffered by Levin for running off.\r\n\r\nStebney Swan, John Stinger, Robert Emerson, Anthony Pugh and Isabella\r\n----. This company came from Portsmouth, Va. Stebney is thirty-four\r\nyears of age, medium size, mulatto, and quite wide awake. He was owned\r\nby an oysterman by the name of Jos. Carter, who lived near Portsmouth.\r\nNaturally enough his master \"drank hard, gambled\" extensively, and in\r\nevery other respect was a very ordinary man. Nevertheless, he \"owned\r\ntwenty-five head,\" and had a wife and six children. Stebney testified\r\nthat he had not been used hard, though he had been on the \"auction-block\r\nthree times.\" Left because he was \"tired of being a servant.\" Armed with\r\na broad-axe and hatchet, he started, joined by the above-named\r\ncompanions, and came in a skiff, by sea. Robert Lee was the brave\r\nCaptain engaged to pilot this Slavery-sick party from the prison-house\r\nof bondage. And although every rod of rowing was attended with\r\ninconceivable peril, the desired haven was safely reached, and the\r\noverjoyed voyagers conducted to the Vigilance Committee.\r\n\r\nJohn is about forty years of age, and so near white that a microscope\r\nwould be required to discern his colored origin. His father was white,\r\nand his mother nearly so. He also had been owned by the oysterman\r\nalluded to above; had been captain of one of his oyster-boats, until\r\nrecently. And but for his attempt some months back to make his escape,\r\nhe might have been this day in the care of his kind-hearted master. But,\r\nbecause of this wayward step on the part of John, his master felt called\r\nupon to humble him. Accordingly, the captaincy was taken from him, and\r\nhe was compelled to struggle on in a less honorable position.\r\nOccasionally John's mind would be refreshed by his master relating the\r\nhard times in the North, the great starvation among the blacks, etc. He\r\nwould also tell John how much better off he was as a \"slave with a kind\r\nmaster to provide for all his wants,\" etc. Notwithstanding all this\r\ncounsel, John did not rest contented until he was on the Underground\r\nRail Road.\r\n\r\nRobert was only nineteen, with an intelligent face and prepossessing\r\nmanners; reads, writes and ciphers; and is about half Anglo-Saxon. He\r\nfled from Wm. H. Wilson, Esq., Cashier of the Virginia Bank. Until\r\nwithin the four years previous to Robert's escape, the cashier was\r\nspoken of as a \"very good man;\" but in consequence of speculations in a\r\nlarge Hotel in Portsmouth, and the then financial embarrassments, \"he\r\nhad become seriously involved,\" and decidedly changed in his manners.\r\nRobert noticed this, and concluded he had \"better get out of danger as\r\nsoon as possible.\"\r\n\r\nAnthony and Isabella were an engaged couple, and desired to cast their\r\nlot where husband and wife could not be separated on the auction-block.\r\n\r\nThe following are of the Cambridge party, above alluded to. All left\r\ntogether, but for prudential reasons separated before reaching\r\nPhiladelphia. The company that left Cambridge on the 24th of October may\r\nbe thus recognized: Aaron Cornish and wife, with their six children;\r\nSolomon, George Anthony, Joseph, Edward James, Perry Lake, and a\r\nnameless babe, all very likely; Kit Anthony and wife Leah, and three\r\nchildren, Adam, Mary, and Murray; Joseph Hill and wife Alice, and their\r\nson Henry; also Joseph's sister. Add to the above, Marshall Button and\r\nGeorge Light, both single young men, and we have twenty-eight in one\r\narrival, as hearty-looking, brave and interesting specimens of Slavery\r\nas could well be produced from Maryland. Before setting out they counted\r\nwell the cost. Being aware that fifteen had left their neighborhood only\r\na few days ahead of them, and that every slave-holder and slave-catcher\r\nthroughout the community, were on the alert, and raging furiously\r\nagainst the inroads of the Underground Rail Road, they provided\r\nthemselves with the following weapons of defense: three revolvers, three\r\ndouble-barreled pistols, three single-barreled pistols, three\r\nsword-canes, four butcher knives, one bowie-knife, and one paw.[A] Thus,\r\nfully resolved upon freedom or death, with scarcely provisions enough\r\nfor a single day, while the rain and storm was piteously descending,\r\nfathers and mothers with children in their arms (Aaron Cornish had\r\ntwo)--the entire party started. Of course, their provisions gave out\r\nbefore they were fairly on the way, but not so with the storm. It\r\ncontinued to pour upon them for nearly three days. With nothing to\r\nappease the gnawings of hunger but parched corn and a few dry crackers,\r\nwet and cold, with several of the children sick, some of their feet bare\r\nand worn, and one of the mothers with an infant in her arms, incapable\r\nof partaking of the diet,--it is impossible to imagine the ordeal they\r\nwere passing. It was enough to cause the bravest hearts to falter. But\r\nnot for a moment did they allow themselves to look back. It was\r\nexceedingly agreeable to hear even the little children testify that in\r\nthe most trying hour on the road, not for a moment did they want to go\r\nback. The following advertisement, taken from _The Cambridge Democrat_\r\nof November 4, shows how the Rev. Levi Traverse felt about Aaron--\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: A paw is a weapon with iron prongs, four inches long, to be\r\ngrasped with the hand and used in close encounter.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    $300 Reward.--Ran away from the subscriber, from the\r\n    neighborhood of Town Point, on Saturday night, the 24th inst.,\r\n    my negro man, AARON CORNISH, about 35 years old. He is about\r\n    five feet ten inches high, black, good-looking, rather pleasant\r\n    countenance, and carries himself with a confident manner. He\r\n    went off with his wife, DAFFNEY, a negro woman belonging to\r\n    Reuben E. Phillips. I will give the above reward if taken out of\r\n    the county, and $200 if taken in the county; in either case to\r\n    be lodged in Cambridge Jail.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Runaway]\r\n\r\n    October 25, 1857.\r\n\r\n    Levi D. Traverse.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo fully understand the Rev. Mr. Traverse's authority for taking the\r\nliberty he did with Aaron's good name, it may not be amiss to give\r\nbriefly a paragraph of private information from Aaron, relative to his\r\nmaster. The Rev. Mr. Traverse belonged to the Methodist Church, and was\r\ndescribed by Aaron as a \"bad young man; rattle-brained; with the\r\nappearance of not having good sense,--not enough to manage the great\r\namount of property (he had been left wealthy) in his possession.\"\r\nAaron's servitude commenced under this spiritual protector in May prior\r\nto the escape, immediately after the death of his old master. His\r\ndeceased master, William D. Traverse, by the way, was the father-in-law,\r\nand at the same time own uncle of Aaron's reverend owner. Though the\r\nyoung master, for marrying his own cousin and uncle's daughter, had been\r\nfor years the subject of the old gentleman's wrath, and was not allowed\r\nto come near his house, or to entertain any reasonable hope of getting\r\nany of his father-in-law's estate, nevertheless, scarcely had the old\r\nman breathed his last, ere the young preacher seized upon the\r\ninheritance, slaves and all; at least he claimed two-thirds, allowing\r\nfor the widow one-third. Unhesitatingly he had taken possession of all\r\nthe slaves (some thirty head), and was making them feel his power to the\r\nfullest extent. To Aaron this increased oppression was exceedingly\r\ncrushing, as he had been hoping at the death of his old master to be\r\nfree. Indeed, it was understood that the old man had his will made, and\r\nfreedom provided for the slaves. But, strangely enough, at his death no\r\nwill could be found. Aaron was firmly of the conviction that the Rev.\r\nMr. Traverse knew what became of it. Between the widow and the\r\nson-in-law, in consequence of his aggressive steps, existed much\r\nhostility, which strongly indicated the approach of a law-suit;\r\ntherefore, except by escaping, Aaron could not see the faintest hope of\r\nfreedom. Under his old master, the favor of hiring his time had been\r\ngranted him. He had also been allowed by his wife's mistress (Miss Jane\r\nCarter, of Baltimore), to have his wife and children home with him--that\r\nis, until his children would grow to the age of eight and ten years,\r\nthen they would be taken away and hired out at twelve or fifteen dollars\r\na year at first. Her oldest boy, sixteen, hired the year he left for\r\nforty dollars. They had had ten children; two had died, two they were\r\ncompelled to leave in chains; the rest they brought away. Not one\r\ndollar's expense had they been to their mistress. The industrious Aaron\r\nnot only had to pay his own hire, but was obliged to do enough over-work\r\nto support his large family.\r\n\r\nThough he said he had no special complaint to make against his old\r\nmaster, through whom he, with the rest of the slaves, hoped to obtain\r\nfreedom, Aaron, nevertheless, spoke of him as a man of violent temper,\r\nsevere on his slaves, drinking hard, etc., though he was a man of wealth\r\nand stood high in the community. One of Aaron's brothers, and others,\r\nhad been sold South by him. It was on account of his inveterate hatred\r\nof his son-in-law, who, he declared, should never have his property\r\n(having no other heir but his niece, except his widow), that the slaves\r\nrelied on his promise to free them. Thus, in view of the facts referred\r\nto, Aaron was led to commit the unpardonable sin of running away with\r\nhis wife Daffney, who, by the way, looked like a woman fully capable of\r\ntaking care of herself and children, instead of having them stolen away\r\nfrom her, as though they were pigs.\r\n\r\nJoseph Viney and family--Joseph was \"held to service or labor,\" by\r\nCharles Bryant, of Alexandria, Va. Joseph had very nearly finished\r\npaying for himself. His wife and children were held by Samuel Pattison,\r\nEsq., a member of the Methodist Church, \"a great big man,\" \"with red\r\neyes, bald head, drank pretty freely,\" and in the language of Joseph,\r\n\"wouldn't bear nothing.\" Two of Joseph's brothers-in-law had been sold\r\nby his master. Against Mrs. Pattison his complaint was, that \"she was\r\nmean, sneaking, and did not want to give half enough to eat.\"\r\n\r\nFor the enlightenment of all Christendom, and coming posterity\r\nespecially, the following advertisement and letter are recorded, with\r\nthe hope that they will have an important historical value. The writer\r\nwas at great pains to obtain these interesting documents, directly after\r\nthe arrival of the memorable Twenty-Eight; and shortly afterwards\r\nfurnished to the New York _Tribune_, in a prudential manner, a brief\r\nsketch of these very passengers, including the advertisements, but not\r\nthe letter.

THOMPSON:--SIR, this morning I received your letter wishing\r\n    an accurate description of my Negroes which ran away on the 24th\r\n    of last month and the amt of reward offered &c &c. The\r\n    description is as follows. _Kit_ is about 35 years old, five\r\n    feet, six or seven inches high, dark chestnut color and has a\r\n    scar on one of his thumbs, he has a very quick step and walks\r\n    very straight, and can read and write. _Joe_, is about 30 years\r\n    old, very black and about five feet eight inches high, has a\r\n    very pleasing appearance, he has a free wife who left with him\r\n    she is a light molatoo, she has a child not over one year old.\r\n    _Henry_ is about 22 years old, five feet, ten inches high, of\r\n    dark chestnut coller and large front teeth, he stoops a little\r\n    in his walk and has a downward look. _Joe_ is about 20 years\r\n    old, about five feet six inches high, heavy built, and has a\r\n    grum look and voice dull, and black. _Tom_ is about 16 years old\r\n    about five feet high light chestnut coller, smart active boy,\r\n    and swagers in his walk. Susan is about 35 years old, dark\r\n    chesnut coller and stout built, speaks rather slow and has with\r\n    her _four children, three boys_ and one _girl_--the girl has a\r\n    thumb or finger on her left hand (part of it) cut off, the\r\n    children are from 9 months to 8 years old. (the youngest a boy 9\r\n    months and the oldest whose name is Lloyd is about 8 years old)\r\n    The husband of Susan (Joe Viney) started off with her, he is a\r\n    slave, belonging to a gentleman in Alexandria D.C. he is about\r\n    40 years old and dark chesnut coller rather slender built and\r\n    about five feet seven or eight inches high, he is also the\r\n    Father of Henry, Joe and Tom.

And including Joe Viney's reward $2650.00.\r\n\r\n    At the same time eight other negroes belonging to a neighbor of\r\n    mine ran off, for which a reward of $1400.00 has been offered\r\n    for them.\r\n\r\n    If you should want any information, witnesses to prove or\r\n    indentify the negroes, write immediately on to me. Or if you\r\n    should need any information with regard to proving the negroes,\r\n    before I could reach Philadelphia, you can call on Mr. Burroughs\r\n    at Martin & Smith's store, Market Street, No 308. Phila and he\r\n    can refer you to a gentleman who knows the negroes.\r\n\r\n    Yours &c SAML. PATTISON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter was in answer to one written in Philadelphia and signed,\r\n\"L.W. Thompson.\" It is not improbable that Mr. Pattison's loss had\r\nproduced such a high state of mental excitement that he was hardly in a\r\ncondition for cool reflection, or he would have weighed the matter a\r\nlittle more carefully before exposing himself to the U.G.R.R. agents.\r\nBut the letter possesses two commendable features, nevertheless. It was\r\ntolerably well written and prompt.\r\n\r\nHere is a wonderful exhibition of affection for his contented and happy\r\nnegroes. Whether Mr. Pattison suspended on suddenly learning that he was\r\nminus fifteen head, the writer cannot say. But that there was a great\r\nslave hunt in every direction there is no room to doubt. Though much\r\nmore might be said about the parties concerned, it must suffice to add\r\nthat they came to the Vigilance Committee in a very sad plight--in\r\ntattered garments, hungry, sick, and penniless; but they were kindly\r\nclothed, fed, doctored, and sent on their way rejoicing.\r\n\r\nDaniel Stanly, Nat Amby, John Scott, Hannah Peters, Henrietta Dobson,\r\nElizabeth Amby, Josiah Stanly, Caroline Stanly, Daniel Stanly, jr., John\r\nStanly and Miller Stanly (arrival from Cambridge.) Daniel is about 35,\r\nwell-made and wide-awake. Fortunately, in emancipating himself, he also,\r\nthrough great perseverance, secured the freedom of his wife and six\r\nchildren; one child he was compelled to leave behind. Daniel belonged to\r\nRobert Calender, a farmer, and, \"except when in a passion,\" said to be\r\n\"pretty clever.\" However, considering as a father, that it was his \"duty\r\nto do all he could\" for his children, and that all work and no play\r\nmakes Jack a dull boy, Daniel felt bound to seek refuge in Canada. His\r\nwife and children were owned by \"Samuel Count, an old, bald-headed, bad\r\nman,\" who \"had of late years been selling and buying slaves as a\r\nbusiness,\" though he stood high and was a \"big bug in Cambridge.\" The\r\nchildren were truly likely-looking.\r\n\r\nNat is no ordinary man. Like a certain other Nat known to history, his\r\nhonest and independent bearing in every respect was that of a natural\r\nhero. He was full black, and about six feet high; of powerful physical\r\nproportions, and of more than ordinary intellectual capacities. With the\r\nstrongest desire to make the Port of Canada safely, he had resolved to\r\nbe \"carried back,\" if attacked by the slave hunters, \"only as a dead\r\nman.\" He was held to service by John Muir, a wealthy farmer, and the\r\nowner of 40 or 50 slaves. \"Muir would drink and was generally devilish.\"\r\nTwo of Nat's sisters and one of his brothers had been \"sold away to\r\nGeorgia by him.\" Therefore, admonished by threats and fears of having to\r\npass through the same fiery furnace, Nat was led to consider the\r\nU.G.R.R. scheme. It was through the marriage of Nat's mistress to his\r\npresent owner that he came into Muir's hands. \"Up to the time of her\r\ndeath,\" he had been encouraged to \"hope\" that he would be \"free;\"\r\nindeed, he was assured by her \"dying testimony that the slaves were not\r\nto be sold.\" But regardless of the promises and will of his departed\r\nwife, Muir soon extinguished all hopes of freedom from that quarter. But\r\nnot believing that God had put one man here to \"be the servant of\r\nanother--to work,\" and get none of the benefit of his labor, Nat armed\r\nhimself with a good pistol and a big knife, and taking his wife with\r\nhim, bade adieu forever to bondage. Observing that Lizzie (Nat's wife)\r\nlooked pretty decided and resolute, a member of the committee remarked,\r\n\"Would your wife fight for freedom?\" \"I have heard her say she would\r\nwade through blood and tears for her freedom,\" said Nat, in the most\r\nserious mood.\r\n\r\nThe following advertisement from _The Cambridge Democrat_ of Nov. 4,\r\nspeaks for itself--\r\n\r\n\r\n    $300 REWARD.--Ran away from the subscriber, on Saturday night\r\n    last, 17th inst., my negro woman Lizzie, about 28 years old. She\r\n    is medium sized, dark complexion, good-looking, with rather a\r\n    down look. When spoken to, replies quickly. She was well\r\n    dressed, wearing a red and green blanket shawl, and carried with\r\n    her a variety of clothing. She ran off in company with her\r\n    husband, Nat Amby (belonging to John Muir, Esq.), who is about 6\r\n    feet in height, with slight impediment in his speech, dark\r\n    chestnut color, and a large scar on the side of his neck.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    I will give the above reward if taken in this County, or\r\n    one-half of what she sells for if taken out of the County or\r\n    State.

He was armed with a\r\nformidable dirk-knife, and declared he would use it if attacked, rather\r\nthan be dragged back to bondage.\r\n\r\nHannah is a hearty-looking young woman of 23 or 24, with a countenance\r\nthat indicated that liberty was what she wanted and was contending for,\r\nand that she could not willingly submit to the yoke. Though she came\r\nwith the Cambridge party, she did not come from Cambridge, but from\r\nMarshall Hope, Caroline County, where she had been owned by Charles\r\nPeters, a man who had distinguished himself by getting \"drunk,\r\nscratching and fighting, etc.,\" not unfrequently in his own family even.\r\nShe had no parents that she knew of. Left because they used her \"so bad,\r\nbeat and knocked\" her about.\r\n\r\n\"Jack Scott.\" Jack is about thirty-six years of age, substantially\r\nbuilt, dark color, and of quiet and prepossessing manners. He was owned\r\nby David B. Turner, Esq., a dry goods merchant of New York. By birth,\r\nTurner was a Virginian, and a regular slave-holder. His slaves were kept\r\nhired out by the year. As Jack had had but slight acquaintance with his\r\nNew York owner, he says but very little about him. He was moved to leave\r\nsimply because he had got tired of working for the \"white people for\r\nnothing.\" Fled from Richmond, Va. Jack went to Canada direct. The\r\nfollowing letter furnishes a clew to his whereabouts, plans, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MONTREAL, September 1st 1859.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:--It is with extreme pleasure that I set down to\r\n    inclose you a few lines to let you know that I am well & I hope\r\n    when these few lines come to hand they may find you & your\r\n    family in good health and prosperity I left your house Nov. 3d,\r\n    1857, for Canada I Received a letter here from James Carter in\r\n    Peters burg, saying that my wife would leave there about the\r\n    28th or the first September and that he would send her on by way\r\n    of Philadelphia to you to send on to Montreal if she come on you\r\n    be please to send her on and as there is so many boats coming\r\n    here all times a day I may not know what time she will.

Hitchens.--This individual took his departure from Milford, Del.,\r\nwhere he was owned by Wm. Hill, a farmer, who took special delight in\r\nhaving \"fighting done on the place.\" This passenger was one of our least\r\nintelligent travelers. He was about 22.\r\n\r\nMajor Ross.--Major fled from John Jay, a farmer residing in the\r\nneighborhood of Havre de Grace, Md. But for the mean treatment received\r\nfrom Mr. Jay, Major might have been foolish enough to have remained all\r\nhis days in chains. \"It's an ill wind that blows nobody any good.\"\r\n\r\nHenry Oberne.--Henry was to be free at 28, but preferred having it at\r\n21, especially as he was not certain that 28 would ever come. He is of\r\nchestnut color, well made, &c., and came from Seaford, Md.\r\n\r\nPerry Burton.--Perry is about twenty-seven years of age, decidedly\r\ncolored, medium size, and only of ordinary intellect. He acknowledged\r\nJohn R. Burton, a farmer on Indian River, as his master, and escaped\r\nbecause he wanted \"some day for himself.\"\r\n\r\nAlfred Hubert, Israel Whitney and John Thompson. Alfred is of powerful\r\nmuscular appearance and naturally of a good intellect. He is full dark\r\nchestnut color, and would doubtless fetch a high price. He was owned by\r\nMrs. Matilda Niles, from whom he had hired his time, paying $110 yearly.\r\nHe had no fault to find with his mistress, except he observed she had a\r\nyoung family growing up, into whose hands he feared he might unluckily\r\nfall some day, and saw no way of avoiding it but by flight. Being only\r\ntwenty-eight, he may yet make his mark.\r\n\r\nIsrael was owned by Elijah Money. All that he could say in favor of his\r\nmaster was, that he treated him \"respectfully,\" though he \"drank hard.\"\r\nIsrael was about thirty-six, and another excellent specimen of an\r\nable-bodied and wide-awake man. He hired his time at the rate of $120 a\r\nyear, and had to find his wife and child in the bargain. He came from\r\nAlexandria, Va.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERESTING LETTER FROM ISRAEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    HAMILTON, Oct. 16, 1858.\r\n\r\n    WILLIAM STILL--_My Dear Friend_:--I saw Carter and his friend a\r\n    few days ago, and they told me, that you was well.

Nothing more at present, only I still\r\n    remain in Hamilton, C.W.\r\n\r\n    ISRAEL WHITNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn is nineteen years of age, mulatto, spare made, but not lacking in\r\ncourage, mother wit or perseverance. He was born in Fauquier county,\r\nVa., and, after experiencing Slavery for a number of years there--being\r\nsold two or three times to the \"highest bidder\"--he was finally\r\npurchased by a cotton planter named Hezekiah Thompson, residing at\r\nHuntsville, Alabama. Immediately after the sale Hezekiah bundled his new\r\n\"purchase\" off to Alabama, where he succeeded in keeping him only about\r\ntwo years, for at the end of that time John determined to strike a blow\r\nfor liberty. The incentive to this step was the inhuman treatment he was\r\nsubjected to. Cruel indeed did he find it there. His master was a young\r\nman, \"fond of drinking and carousing, and always ready for a fight or a\r\nknock-down.\" A short time before John left his master whipped him so\r\nseverely with the \"bull whip\" that he could not use his arm for three or\r\nfour days. Seeing but one way of escape (and that more perilous than the\r\nway William and Ellen Craft, or Henry Box Brown traveled), he resolved\r\nto try it. It was to get on the top of the car, instead of inside of it,\r\nand thus ride of nights, till nearly daylight, when, at a stopping-place\r\non the road, he would slip off the car, and conceal himself in the woods\r\nuntil under cover of the next night he could manage to get on the top of\r\nanother car. By this most hazardous mode of travel he reached Virginia.\r\n\r\nIt may be best not to attempt to describe how he suffered at the hands\r\nof his owners in Alabama; or how severely he was pinched with hunger in\r\ntraveling; or how, when he reached his old neighborhood in Virginia, he\r\ncould not venture to inquire for his mother, brothers or sisters, to\r\nreceive from them an affectionate word, an encouraging smile, a crust of\r\nbread, or a drink of water.\r\n\r\nSuccess attended his efforts for more than two weeks; but alas, after\r\nhaving got back north of Richmond, on his way home to Alexandria, he was\r\ncaptured and put in prison; his master being informed of the fact, came\r\non and took possession of him again. At first he refused to sell him;\r\nsaid he \"had money enough and owned about thirty slaves;\" therefore\r\nwished to \"take him back to make an example of him.\" However, through\r\nthe persuasion of an uncle of his, he consented to sell. Accordingly,\r\nJohn was put on the auction-block and bought for $1,300 by Green\r\nMcMurray, a regular trader in Richmond. McMurray again offered him for\r\nsale, but in consequence of hard times and the high price demanded, John\r\ndid not go off, at least not in the way the trader desired to dispose of\r\nhim, but did, nevertheless, succeed in going off on the Underground Rail\r\nRoad. Thus once more he reached his old home, Alexandria. His mother was\r\nin one place, and his six brothers and sisters evidently scattered,\r\nwhere he knew not. Since he was five years of age, not one of them had\r\nhe seen.\r\n\r\nIf such sufferings and trials were not entitled to claim for the\r\nsufferer the honor of a hero, where in all Christendom could one be\r\nfound who could prove a better title to that appellation?\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that the Committee extended to him brotherly\r\nkindness, sympathized with him deeply, and sent him on his way\r\nrejoicing.\r\n\r\nOf his subsequent career the following extract from a letter written at\r\nLondon shows that he found no rest for the soles of his feet under the\r\nStars and Stripes in New York:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I hope that you will remember John Thompson, who passed through\r\n    your hands, I think, in October, 1857, at the same time that Mr.\r\n    Cooper, from Charleston, South Carolina, came on. I was engaged\r\n    at New York, in the barber business, with a friend, and was\r\n    doing very well, when I was betrayed and obliged to sail for\r\n    England very suddenly, my master being in the city to arrest me.\r\n\r\n    (LONDON, December 21st, 1860.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Escaping from Alabama on top of a car.]\r\n\r\nJEREMIAH COLBURN.--Jeremiah is a bright mulatto, of prepossessing\r\nappearance, reads and writes, and is quite intelligent. He fled from\r\nCharleston, where he had been owned by Mrs. E. Williamson, an old lady\r\nabout seventy-five, a member of the Episcopal Church, and opposed to\r\nFreedom. As far as he was concerned, however, he said, she had treated\r\nhim well; but, knowing that the old lady would not be long here, he\r\njudged it was best to look out in time. Consequently, he availed himself\r\nof an Underground Rail Road ticket, and bade adieu to that hot-bed of\r\nsecession, South Carolina. Indeed, he was fair enough to pass for white,\r\nand actually came the entire journey from Charleston to this city under\r\nthe garb of a white gentleman. With regard to gentlemanly bearing,\r\nhowever, he was all right in this particular. Nevertheless, as he had\r\nbeen a slave all his days, he found that it required no small amount of\r\nnerve to succeed in running the gauntlet with slave-holders and\r\nslave-catchers for so long a journey.\r\n\r\nThe following pointed epistle, from Jeremiah Colburn alias William\r\nCooper, beautifully illustrates the effects of Freedom on many a\r\npassenger who received hospitalities at the Philadelphia depot--\r\n\r\n\r\n    SYRACUSE, June 9th, 1858.\r\n\r\n    MR. STILL:--_Dear Sir_:--One of your Underground R.R.

It\r\n    will afford me much Pleasure to hear from you.\r\n\r\n    yours Truly,\r\n\r\n    WILLIAM COOPER.\r\n\r\n    John Thompson is still here and Doing well.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that this young Charlestonian had rather exalted notions\r\nin his head. He was contemplating going to McGrawville College, for the\r\npurpose of preparing himself for the lecturing field. Was it not rather\r\nstrange that he did not want to return to his \"kind-hearted old\r\nmistress?\"\r\n\r\nTHOMAS HENRY, NATHAN COLLINS AND HIS WIFE MARY ELLEN.--Thomas is about\r\ntwenty-six, quite dark, rather of a raw-boned make, indicating that\r\ntimes with him had been other than smooth. A certain Josiah Wilson owned\r\nThomas. He was a cross, rugged man, allowing not half enough to eat, and\r\nworked his slaves late and early. Especially within the last two or\r\nthree months previous to the escape, he had been intensely savage, in\r\nconsequence of having lost, not long before, two of his servants. Ever\r\nsince that misfortune, he had frequently talked of \"putting the rest in\r\nhis pocket.\" This distressing threat made the rest love him none the\r\nmore; but, to make assurances doubly sure, after giving them their\r\nsupper every evening, which consisted of delicious \"skimmed milk, corn\r\ncake and a herring each,\" he would very carefully send them up in the\r\nloft over the kitchen, and there \"lock them up,\" to remain until called\r\nthe next morning at three or four o'clock to go to work again. Destitute\r\nof money, clothing, and a knowledge of the way, situated as they were\r\nthey concluded to make an effort for Canada.\r\n\r\nNATHAN was also a fellow-servant with Thomas, and of course owned by\r\nWilson. Nathan's wife, however, was owned by Wilson's son, Abram. Nathan\r\nwas about twenty-five years of age, not very dark. He had a remarkably\r\nlarge head on his shoulders and was the picture of determination, and\r\napparently was exactly the kind of a subject that might be desirable in\r\nthe British possessions, in the forest or on the farm.\r\n\r\nHis wife, Mary Ellen, is a brown-skinned, country-looking young woman,\r\nabout twenty years of age. In escaping, they had to break jail, in the\r\ndead of night, while all were asleep in the big house; and thus they\r\nsucceeded. What Mr. Wilson did, said or thought about these \"shiftless\"\r\ncreatures we are not prepared to say; we may, notwithstanding,\r\nreasonably infer that the Underground has come in for a liberal share of\r\nhis indignation and wrath. The above travelers came from near New\r\nMarket, Md. The few rags they were clad in were not really worth the\r\nprice that a woman would ask for washing them, yet they brought with\r\nthem about all they had. Thus they had to be newly rigged at the expense\r\nof the Vigilance Committee.\r\n\r\n_The Cambridge Democrat_, of Nov. 4, 1857, from which the advertisements\r\nwere cut, said--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"At a meeting of the people of this county, held in Cambridge,\r\n    on the 2d of November, to take into consideration the better\r\n    protection of the interests of the slave-owners; among other\r\n    things that were done, it was resolved to enforce the various\r\n    acts of Assembly  *  *  *  *  relating to servants and slaves.\r\n\r\n    \"The act of 1715, chap. 44, sec. 2, provides 'that from and\r\n    after the publication thereof no servant or servants whatsoever,\r\n    within this province, whether by indenture or by the custom of\r\n    the counties, or hired for wages shall travel by land or water\r\n    ten miles from the house of his, her or their master, mistress\r\n    or dame, without a note under their hands, or under the hands of\r\n    his, her or their overseer, if any be, under the penalty of\r\n    being taken for a runaway, and to suffer such penalties as\r\n    hereafter provided against runaways.' The Act of 1806, chap. 81,\r\n    sec. 5, provides, 'That any person taking up such runaway, shall\r\n    have and receive $6,' to be paid by the master or owner. It was\r\n    also determined to have put in force the act of 1825, chap. 161,\r\n    and the act of 1839, chap. 320, relative to idle, vagabond, free\r\n    negroes, providing for their sale or banishment from the State.\r\n    All persons interested, are hereby notified that the aforesaid\r\n    laws, in particular, will be enforced, and all officers failing\r\n    to enforce them will be presented to the Grand Jury, and those\r\n    who desire to avoid the penalties of the aforesaid statutes are\r\n    requested to conform to these provisions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the modus operandi by which so many men, women and children were\r\ndelivered and safely forwarded to Canada, despite slave-hunters and the\r\nfugitive slave law, the subjoined letters, from different agents and\r\ndepots, will throw important light on the question.\r\n\r\nMen and women aided in this cause who were influenced by no oath of\r\nsecresy, who received not a farthing for their labors, who believed that\r\nGod had put it into the hearts of all mankind to love liberty, and had\r\ncommanded men to \"feel for those in bonds as bound with them,\" \"to break\r\nevery yoke and let the oppressed go free.\" But here are the letters,\r\nbearing at least on some of the travelers:\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILMINGTON, 10th Mo. 31st, 1857.\r\n\r\n    ESTEEMED FRIEND WILLIAM STILL:--I write to inform thee that we\r\n    have either 17 or 27, I am not certain which, of that large Gang\r\n    of God's poor, and I hope they are safe. The man who has them in\r\n    charge informed me there were 27 safe and one boy lost during\r\n    last night, about 14 years of age, without shoes; we have felt\r\n    some anxiety about him, for fear he may be taken up and betray\r\n    the rest. I have since been informed there are but 17 so that I\r\n    cannot at present tell which is correct. I have several looking\r\n    out for the lad; they will be kept from Phila. for the present.\r\n    My principal object in writing thee at this time is to inform\r\n    thee of what one of our constables told me this morning; he told\r\n    me that a colored man in Phila. who professed to be a great\r\n    friend of the colored people was a traitor; that he had been\r\n    written to by an Abolitionist in Baltimore, to keep a look out\r\n    for those slaves that left Cambridge this night week, told him\r\n    they would be likely to pass through Wilmington on 6th day or\r\n    7th day night, and the colored man in Phila. had written to the\r\n    master of part of them telling him the above, and the master\r\n    arrived here yesterday in consequence of the information, and\r\n    told one of our constables the above; the man told the name of\r\n    the Baltimore writer, which he had forgotten, but declined\r\n    telling the name of the colored man in Phila. I hope you will be\r\n    able to find out who he is, and should I be able to learn the\r\n    name of the Baltimore friend, I will put him on his Guard,\r\n    respecting his Phila. correspondents. As ever thy friend, and\r\n    the friend of Humanity, without regard to color or clime.\r\n\r\n    THOS. GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow much truth there was in the \"constable's\" story to the effect, \"that\r\na colored man in Philadelphia, who professed to be a great friend of the\r\ncolored people, was a traitor, etc.,\" the Committee never learned. As a\r\ngeneral thing, colored people were true to the fugitive slave; but now\r\nand then some unprincipled individuals, under various pretenses, would\r\ncause us great anxiety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM JOHN AUGUSTA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    NORRISTOWN Oct 18th 1857 2 o'clock PM\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:--There is Six men and women and Five children making\r\n    Eleven Persons. If you are willing to Receve them write to me\r\n    imediately and I will bring them to your To morrow Evening I\r\n    would not Have wrote this But the Times are so much worse\r\n    Financialy that I thought It best to hear From you Before I\r\n    Brought such a Crowd Down Pleas Answer this and\r\n\r\n    Oblige\r\n\r\n    JOHN AUGUSTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis document has somewhat of a military appearance about it. It is\r\nshort and to the point. Friend Augusta was well known in Norristown as a\r\nfirst-rate hair-dresser and a prompt and trustworthy Underground Rail\r\nRoad agent. Of course a speedy answer was returned to his note, and he\r\nwas instructed to bring the eleven passengers on to the Committee in\r\nBrotherly Love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM MISS G. LEWIS ABOUT A PORTION OF THE SAME \"MEMORABLE\r\nTWENTY-EIGHT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    SUNNYSIDE, Nov. 6th, 1857.\r\n\r\n    DEAR FRIEND:--Eight more of the large company reached our place\r\n    last night, direct from Ercildown. The eight constitute one\r\n    family of them, the husband and wife with four children under\r\n    eight years of age, wish tickets for Elmira. Three sons, nearly\r\n    grown, will be forwarded to Phila., probably by the train which\r\n    passes Phoenixville at seven o'clock of to-morrow evening the\r\n    seventh. It would be safest to meet them there. We shall send\r\n    them to Elijah with the request for them to be sent there. And I\r\n    presume they will be. If they should not arrive you may suppose\r\n    it did not suit Elijah to send them.\r\n\r\n    We will send the money for the tickets by C.C. Burleigh, who\r\n    will be in Phila. on second day morning. If you please, you will\r\n    forward the tickets by to-morrow's mail as we do not have a mail\r\n    again till third day.\r\n\r\n    Yours hastily,\r\n\r\n    Q. LEWIS.\r\n\r\n    Please give directions for forwarding to Elmira and name the\r\n    price of tickets.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first Miss Lewis thought of forwarding only a part of her fugitive\r\nguests to the Committee in Philadelphia, but on further consideration,\r\nall were safely sent along in due time, and the Committee took great\r\npains to have them made as comfortable as possible, as the cases of\r\nthese mothers and children especially called forth the deepest sympathy.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it seems but fitting to allude to Captain Lee's\r\nsufferings on account of his having brought away in a skiff, by sea, a\r\nparty of four, alluded to in the beginning of this single month's\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately he was suspected, arrested, tried, convicted, and torn\r\nfrom his wife and two little children, and sent to the Richmond\r\nPenitentiary for twenty-five years. Before being sent away from\r\nPortsmouth, Va., where he was tried, for ten days in succession in the\r\nprison five lashes a day were laid heavily on his bare back. The further\r\nsufferings of poor Lee and his heart-broken wife, and his little\r\ndaughter and son, are too painful for minute recital. In this city the\r\nfriends of Freedom did all in their power to comfort Mrs. Lee, and\r\nadministered aid to her and her children; but she broke down under her\r\nmournful fate, and went to that bourne from whence no traveler ever\r\nreturns.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lee suffered untold misery in prison, until he, also, not a\r\ngreat while before the Union forces took possession of Richmond, sank\r\nbeneath the severity of his treatment, and went likewise to the grave.\r\nThe two children for a long time were under the care of Mr. Wm. Ingram\r\nof Philadelphia, who voluntarily, from pure benevolence, proved himself\r\nto be a father and a friend to them. To their poor mother also he had\r\nbeen a true friend.\r\n\r\nThe way in which Captain Lee came to be convicted, if the Committee were\r\ncorrectly informed and they think they were, was substantially in this\r\nwise: In the darkness of the night, four men, two of them constables,\r\none of the other two, the owner of one of the slaves who had been aided\r\naway by Lee, seized the wife of one of the fugitives and took her to the\r\nwoods, where the fiends stripped every particle of clothing from her\r\nperson, tied her to a tree, and armed with knives, cowhides and a\r\nshovel, swore vengeance against her, declaring they would kill her if\r\nshe did not testify against Lee. At first she refused to reveal the\r\nsecret; indeed she knew but little to reveal; but her savage tormentors\r\nbeat her almost to death. Under this barbarous infliction she was\r\nconstrained to implicate Captain Lee, which was about all the evidence\r\nthe prosecution had against him. And in reality her evidence, for two\r\nreasons, should not have weighed a straw, as it was contrary to the laws\r\nof the State of Virginia, to admit the testimony of colored persons\r\nagainst white; then again for the reason that this testimony was\r\nobtained wholly by brute force.\r\n\r\nBut in this instance, this woman on whom the murderous attack had been\r\nmade, was brought into court on Lee's trial and was bid to simply make\r\nher statement with regard to Lee's connection with the escape of her\r\nhusband. This she did of course. And in the eyes of this chivalric\r\ncourt, this procedure \"was all right.\" But thank God the events since\r\nthose dark and dreadful days, afford abundant proof that the All-seeing\r\nEye was not asleep to the daily sufferings of the poor bondman.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SLAVE GIRL'S NARRATIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORDELIA LONEY, SLAVE OF MRS. JOSEPH CAHELL (WIDOW OF THE LATE HON.\r\nJOSEPH CAHELL, OF VA.), OF FREDERICKSBURG, VA.--CORDELIA'S ESCAPE FROM\r\nHER MISTRESS IN PHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nRarely did the peculiar institution present the relations of mistress\r\nand maid-servant in a light so apparently favorable as in the case of\r\nMrs. Joseph Cahell (widow of the late Hon. Jos Cahell, of Va.), and her\r\nslave, Cordelia. The Vigilance Committee's first knowledge of either of\r\nthese memorable personages was brought about in the following manner.\r\n\r\nAbout the 30th of March, in the year 1859, a member of the Vigilance\r\nCommittee was notified by a colored servant, living at a fashionable\r\nboarding-house on Chestnut street that a lady with a slave woman from\r\nFredericksburg, Va., was boarding at said house, and, that said slave\r\nwoman desired to receive counsel and aid from the Committee, as she was\r\nanxious to secure her freedom, before her mistress returned to the\r\nSouth. On further consultation about the matter, a suitable hour was\r\nnamed for the meeting of the Committee and the Slave at the above named\r\nboarding-house. Finding that the woman was thoroughly reliable, the\r\nCommittee told her \"that two modes of deliverance were open before her.\r\nOne was to take her trunk and all her clothing and quietly retire.\" The\r\nother was to \"sue out a writ of habeas corpus; and bring the mistress\r\nbefore the Court, where she would be required, under the laws of\r\nPennsylvania, to show cause why she restrained this woman of her\r\nfreedom.\" Cordelia concluded to adopt the former expedient, provided the\r\nCommittee would protect her. Without hesitation the Committee answered\r\nher, that to the extent of their ability, she should have their aid with\r\npleasure, without delay. Consequently a member of the Committee was\r\ndirected to be on hand at a given hour that evening, as Cordelia would\r\ncertainly be ready to leave her mistress to take care of herself. Thus,\r\nat the appointed hour, Cordelia, very deliberately, accompanied the\r\nCommittee away from her \"kind hearted old mistress.\"\r\n\r\nIn the quiet and security of the Vigilance Committee Room, Cordelia\r\nrelated substantially the following brief story touching her\r\nrelationship as a slave to Mrs. Joseph Cahell. In this case, as with\r\nthousands and tens of thousands of others, as the old adage fitly\r\nexpresses it, \"All is not gold that glitters.\" Under this apparently\r\npious and noble-minded lady, it will be seen, that Cordelia had known\r\nnaught but misery and sorrow.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cahell, having engaged board for a month at a fashionable private\r\nboarding-house on Chestnut street, took an early opportunity to caution\r\nCordelia against going into the streets, and against having anything to\r\nsay or do with \"free niggers in particular\"; withal, she appeared\r\nunusually kind, so much so, that before retiring to bed in the evening,\r\nshe would call Cordelia to her chamber, and by her side would take her\r\nPrayer-book and Bible, and go through the forms of devotional service.\r\nShe stood very high both as a church communicant and a lady in society.\r\n\r\nFor a fortnight it seemed as though her prayers were to be answered, for\r\nCordelia apparently bore herself as submissively as ever, and Madame\r\nreceived calls and accepted invitations from some of the _elite_ of the\r\ncity, without suspecting any intention on the part of Cordelia to\r\nescape. But Cordelia could not forget how her children had all been sold\r\nby her mistress!\r\n\r\nCordelia was about fifty-seven years of age, with about an equal\r\nproportion of colored and white blood in her veins; very neat,\r\nrespectful and prepossessing in manner.\r\n\r\nFrom her birth to the hour of her escape she had worn the yoke under\r\nMrs. C., as her most efficient and reliable maid-servant. She had been\r\nat her mistress' beck and call as seamstress, dressing-maid, nurse in\r\nthe sickroom, etc., etc., under circumstances that might appear to the\r\ncasual observer uncommonly favorable for a slave. Indeed, on his first\r\ninterview with her, the Committee man was so forcibly impressed with the\r\nbelief, that her condition in Virginia had been favorable, that he\r\nhesitated to ask her if she did not desire her liberty. A few moments'\r\nconversation with her, however, convinced him of her good sense and\r\ndecision of purpose with regard to this matter. For, in answer to the\r\nfirst question he put to her, she answered, that, \"As many creature\r\ncomforts and religious privileges as she had been the recipient of under\r\nher 'kind mistress,' still she 'wanted to be free,' and 'was bound to\r\nleave,' that she had been 'treated very cruelly,' that her children had\r\n'all been sold away' from her; that she had been threatened with sale\r\nherself 'on the first insult,'\" etc.\r\n\r\nShe was willing to take the entire responsibility of taking care of\r\nherself. On the suggestion of a friend, before leaving her mistress, she\r\nwas disposed to sue for her freedom, but, upon a reconsideration of the\r\nmatter, she chose rather to accept the hospitality of the Underground\r\nRail Road, and leave in a quiet way and go to Canada, where she would be\r\nfree indeed. Accordingly she left her mistress and was soon a free\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nThe following sad experience she related calmly, in the presence of\r\nseveral friends, an evening or two after she left her mistress:\r\n\r\nTwo sons and two daughters had been sold from her by her mistress,\r\nwithin the last three years, since the death of her master. Three of her\r\nchildren had been sold to the Richmond market and the other in Nelson\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nPaulina was the first sold, two years ago last May. Nat was the next; he\r\nwas sold to Abram Warrick, of Richmond. Paulina was sold before it was\r\nnamed to her mother that it had entered her mistress's mind to dispose\r\nof her. Nancy, from infancy, had been in poor health. Nevertheless, she\r\nhad been obliged to take her place in the field with the rest of the\r\nslaves, of more rugged constitution, until she had passed her twentieth\r\nyear, and had become a mother. Under these circumstances, the overseer\r\nand his wife complained to the mistress that her health was really too\r\nbad for a field hand and begged that she might be taken where her duties\r\nwould be less oppressive. Accordingly, she was withdrawn from the field,\r\nand was set to spinning and weaving. When too sick to work her mistress\r\ninvariably took the ground, that \"nothing was the matter,\"\r\nnotwithstanding the fact, that her family physician, Dr. Ellsom, had\r\npronounced her \"quite weakly and sick.\"\r\n\r\nIn an angry mood one day, Mrs. Cahell declared she would cure her; and\r\nagain sent her to the field, \"with orders to the overseer, to whip her\r\nevery day, and make her work or kill her.\" Again the overseer said it\r\nwas \"no use to try, for her health would not stand it,\" and she was\r\nforthwith returned. The mistress then concluded to sell her.\r\n\r\nOne Sabbath evening a nephew of hers, who resided in New Orleans,\r\nhappened to be on a visit to his aunt, when it occurred to her, that she\r\nhad \"better get Nancy off if possible.\" Accordingly, Nancy was called in\r\nfor examination. Being dressed in her \"Sunday best\" and \"before a poor\r\ncandle-light,\" she appeared to good advantage; and the nephew concluded\r\nto start with her on the following Tuesday morning. However, the next\r\nmorning, he happened to see her by the light of the sun, and in her\r\nworking garments, which satisfied him that he had been grossly deceived;\r\nthat she would barely live to reach New Orleans; he positively refused\r\nto carry out the previous evening's contract, thus leaving her in the\r\nhands of her mistress, with the advice, that she should \"doctor her up.\"\r\n\r\nThe mistress, not disposed to be defeated, obviated the difficulty by\r\nselecting a little boy, made a lot of the two, and thus made it an\r\ninducement to a purchaser to buy the sick woman; the boy and the woman\r\nbrought $700.\r\n\r\nIn the sale of her children, Cordelia was as little regarded as if she\r\nhad been a cow.\r\n\r\n\"I felt wretched,\" she said, with emphasis, \"when I heard that Nancy had\r\nbeen sold,\" which was not until after she had been removed. \"But,\" she\r\ncontinued, \"I was not at liberty to make my grief known to a single\r\nwhite soul. I wept and couldn't help it.\" But remembering that she was\r\nliable, \"on the first insult,\" to be sold herself, she sought no\r\nsympathy from her mistress, whom she describes as \"a woman who shows as\r\nlittle kindness towards her servants as any woman in the States of\r\nAmerica. She neither likes to feed nor clothe well.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to flogging, however, in days past, she had been up to the\r\nmark. \"A many a slap and blow\" had Cordelia received since she arrived\r\nat womanhood, directly from the madam's own hand.\r\n\r\nOne day smarting under cruel treatment, she appealed to her mistress in\r\nthe following strain: \"I stood by your mother in all her sickness and\r\nnursed her till she died!\" \"I waited on your niece, night and day for\r\nmonths, till she died.\" \"I waited upon your husband all my life--in his\r\nsickness especially, and shrouded him in death, etc., yet I am treated\r\ncruelly.\" It was of no avail.\r\n\r\nHer mistress, at one time, was the owner of about five hundred slaves,\r\nbut within the last few years she had greatly lessened the number by\r\nsales.\r\n\r\nShe stood very high as a lady, and was a member of the Episcopal Church.\r\n\r\nTo punish Cordelia, on several occasions, she had been sent to one of\r\nthe plantations to work as a field hand. Fortunately, however, she found\r\nthe overseers more compassionate than her mistress, though she received\r\nno particular favors from any of them.\r\n\r\nAsking her to name the overseers, etc., she did so. The first was\r\n\"Marks, a thin-visaged, poor-looking man, great for swearing.\" The\r\nsecond was \"Gilbert Brower, a very rash, portly man.\" The third was\r\n\"Buck Young, a stout man, and very sharp.\" The fourth was \"Lynn Powell,\r\na tall man with red whiskers, very contrary and spiteful.\" There was\r\nalso a fifth one, but his name was lost.\r\n\r\nThus Cordelia's experience, though chiefly confined to the \"great\r\nhouse,\" extended occasionally over the corn and tobacco fields, among\r\nthe overseers and field hands generally. But under no circumstances\r\ncould she find it in her heart to be thankful for the privileges of\r\nSlavery.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving her mistress she learned, with no little degree of\r\npleasure, that a perplexed state of things existed at the\r\nboarding-house; that her mistress was seriously puzzled to imagine how\r\nshe would get her shoes and stockings on and off; how she would get her\r\nhead combed, get dressed, be attended to in sickness, etc., as she\r\n(Cordelia), had been compelled to discharge these offices all her life.\r\n\r\nMost of the boarders, being slave-holders, naturally sympathized in her\r\naffliction; and some of them went so far as to offer a reward to some of\r\nthe colored servants to gain a knowledge of her whereabouts. Some\r\ncharged the servants with having a hand in her leaving, but all agreed\r\nthat \"she had left a very kind and indulgent mistress,\" and had acted\r\nvery foolishly in running out of Slavery into Freedom.\r\n\r\nA certain Doctor of Divinity, the pastor of an Episcopal church in this\r\ncity and a friend of the mistress, hearing of her distress, by request\r\nor voluntarily, undertook to find out Cordelia's place of seclusion.\r\nHailing on the street a certain colored man with a familiar face, who he\r\nthought knew nearly all the colored people about town, he related to him\r\nthe predicament of his lady friend from the South, remarked how kindly\r\nshe had always treated her servants, signified that Cordelia would rue\r\nthe change, and be left to suffer among the \"miserable blacks down\r\ntown,\" that she would not be able to take care of herself; quoted\r\nScripture justifying Slavery, and finally suggested that he (the colored\r\nman) would be doing a duty and a kindness to the fugitive by using his\r\ninfluence to \"find her and prevail upon her to return.\"\r\n\r\nIt so happened that the colored man thus addressed, was Thomas Dorsey,\r\nthe well-known fashionable caterer of Philadelphia, who had had the\r\nexperience of quite a number of years as a slave at the South,--had\r\nhimself once been pursued as a fugitive, and having, by his industry in\r\nthe condition of Freedom, acquired a handsome estate, he felt entirely\r\nqualified to reply to the reverend gentleman, which he did, though in\r\nnot very respectful phrases, telling him that Cordelia had as good a\r\nright to her liberty as he had, or her mistress either; that God had\r\nnever intended one man to be the slave of another; that it was all false\r\nabout the slaves being better off than the free colored people; that he\r\nwould find as many \"poor, miserably degraded,\" of his own color\r\n\"down-town,\" as among the \"degraded blacks\"; and concluded by telling\r\nhim that he would \"rather give her a hundred dollars to help her off,\r\nthan to do aught to make known her whereabouts, if he knew ever so much\r\nabout her.\"\r\n\r\nWhat further steps were taken by the discomfited divine, the mistress,\r\nor her boarding-house sympathizers, the Committee was not informed.\r\n\r\nBut with regard to Cordelia: she took her departure for Canada, in the\r\nmidst of the Daniel Webster (fugitive) trial, with the hope of being\r\npermitted to enjoy the remainder of her life in Freedom and peace. Being\r\na member of the Baptist Church, and professing to be a Christian, she\r\nwas persuaded that, by industry and assistance of the Lord, a way would\r\nbe opened to the seeker of Freedom even in a strange land and among\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\nThis story appeared in part in the _N.Y. Evening Post_, having been\r\nfurnished by the writer, without his name to it. It is certainly none\r\nthe less interesting now, as it may be read in the light of Universal\r\nEmancipation.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL OF JACKSON, ISAAC AND EDMONDSON TURNER FROM PETERSBURG.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOUCHING SCENE ON MEETING THEIR OLD BLIND FATHER AT THE U.G.R.R. DEPOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS AND WARNING TO SLAVEHOLDERS.\r\n\r\nAbout the latter part of December, 1857, Isaac and Edmondson, brothers,\r\nsucceeded in making their escape together from Petersburg, Va. They\r\nbarely escaped the auction block, as their mistress, Mrs. Ann Colley, a\r\nwidow, had just completed arrangements for their sale on the coming\r\nfirst day of January. In this kind of property, however, Mrs. Colley had\r\nnot largely invested. In the days of her prosperity, while all was happy\r\nand contented, she could only boast of \"four head:\" these brothers,\r\nJackson, Isaac and Edmondson and one other. In May, 1857, Jackson had\r\nfled and was received by the Vigilance Committee, who placed him upon\r\ntheir books briefly in the following light:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"RUNAWAY--_Fifty Dollars Reward_,--Ran away some time in May\r\n    last, my _Servant-man_, who calls himself _Jackson Turner_. He\r\n    is about 27 years of age, and has one of his front teeth out. He\r\n    is quite black, with thick lips, a little bow-legged, and looks\r\n    down when spoken to. I will give a reward of Fifty dollars if\r\n    taken out of the city, and twenty five Dollars if taken within\r\n    the city. I forewarn all masters of vessels from harboring or\r\n    employing the said slave; all persons who disregard this Notice\r\n    will be punished as the law directs.\r\n\r\n    ANN COLLEY.\r\n\r\n    Petersburg, June 8th, 1857.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJACKSON is quite dark, medium size, and well informed for one in his\r\ncondition. In Slavery, he had been \"pressed hard.\" His hire, \"ten\r\ndollars per month\" he was obliged to produce at the end of each month,\r\nno matter how much he had been called upon to expend for \"doctor bills,\r\n&c.\" The woman he called mistress went by the name of Ann Colley, a\r\nwidow, living near Petersburg. \"She was very quarrelsome,\" although a\r\n\"member of the Methodist Church.\" Jackson seeing that his mistress was\r\nyearly growing \"harder and harder,\" concluded to try and better his\r\ncondition \"if possible.\" Having a free wife in the North, who was in the\r\nhabit of communicating with him, he was kept fully awake to the love of\r\nFreedom. The Underground Rail Road expense the Committee gladly bore. No\r\nfurther record of Jackson was made. Jackson found his poor old father\r\nhere, where he had resided for a number of years in a state of almost\r\ntotal blindness, and of course in much parental anxiety about his boys\r\nin chains. On the arrival of Jackson, his heart overflowed with joy and\r\ngratitude not easily described, as the old man had hardly been able to\r\nmuster faith enough to believe that he should ever look with his dim\r\neyes upon one of his sons in Freedom. After a day or two's tarrying,\r\nJackson took his departure for safer and more healthful localities,--her\r\n\"British Majesty's possessions.\" The old man remained only to feel more\r\nkeenly than ever, the pang of having sons still toiling in hopeless\r\nservitude.\r\n\r\nIn less than seven months after Jackson had shaken off the yoke, to the\r\nunspeakable joy of the father, Isaac and Edmondson succeeded in\r\nfollowing their brother's example, and were made happy partakers of the\r\nbenefits and blessings of the Vigilance Committee of Philadelphia. On\r\nfirst meeting his two boys, at the Underground Rail Road Depot, the old\r\nman took each one in his arms, and as looking through a glass darkly,\r\nstraining every nerve of his almost lost sight, exclaiming, whilst\r\nhugging them closer and closer to his bosom for some minutes, in tears\r\nof joy and wonder, \"My son Isaac, is this you? my son Isaac, is this\r\nyou, &c.?\" The scene was calculated to awaken the deepest emotion and to\r\nbring tears to eyes not accustomed to weep. Little had the old man\r\ndreamed in his days of sadness, that he should share such a feast of joy\r\nover the deliverance of his sons. But it is in vain to attempt to\r\npicture the affecting scene at this reunion, for that would be\r\nimpossible. Of their slave life, the records contain but a short notice,\r\nsimply as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Isaac is twenty-eight years of age, hearty-looking, well made, dark\r\ncolor and intelligent. He was owned by Mrs. Ann Colley, a widow,\r\nresiding near Petersburg, Va. Isaac and Edmondson were to have been\r\nsold, on New Year's day; a few days hence. How sad her disappointment\r\nmust have been on finding them gone, may be more easily imagined than\r\ndescribed.\"\r\n\r\nEdmondson is about twenty-five, a brother of Isaac, and a smart,\r\ngood-looking young man, was owned by Mrs. Colley also. \"This is just the\r\nclass of fugitives to make good subjects for John Bull,\" thought the\r\nCommittee, feeling pretty well assured that they would make good reports\r\nafter having enjoyed free air in Canada for a short time. Of course, the\r\nCommittee enjoined upon them very earnestly \"not to forget their\r\nbrethren left behind groaning in fetters; but to prove by their\r\nindustry, uprightness, economy, sobriety and thrift, by the remembrance\r\nof their former days of oppression and their obligations to their God,\r\nthat they were worthy of the country to which they were going, and so to\r\nhelp break the bands of the oppressors, and undo the heavy burdens of\r\nthe oppressed.\" Similar advice was impressed upon the minds of all\r\ntravelers passing over this branch of the Underground Rail Road. From\r\nhundreds thus admonished, letters came affording the most gratifying\r\nevidence that the counsel of the Committee was not in vain. The appended\r\nletter from the youngest brother, written with his own hand, will\r\nindicate his feelings and views in Canada:\r\n\r\n\r\n    HAMILTON, CANADA WEST Mar. 1, 1858.\r\n\r\n    MR.

Northing More at this\r\n    time\r\n\r\n    yor truly\r\n\r\n    EDMUND TURNER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same writer sent to the Corresponding Secretary the following\r\n\"Warning to Slave-holders.\" At the time these documents were received,\r\nSlaveholders were never more defiant. The right to trample on the weak\r\nin oppression was indisputable. \"Cinnamon and odors, and ointments, and\r\nfrankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour and wheat, and beasts,\r\nand sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men,\"\r\nslave-holders believed doubtless were theirs by Divine Right. Little\r\ndreaming that in less than three short years--\"Therefore shall her\r\nplagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine.\" In view of\r\nthe marvelous changes which have been wrought by the hand of the\r\nAlmighty, this warning to slave-holders from one who felt the sting of\r\nSlavery, as evincing a particular phase of simple faith and Christian\r\ncharity is entitled to a place in these records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA WARNING TO SLAVE-HOLDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Well may the Southern slaveholder say, that holding their Fellow\r\n    men in Bondage is no sin, because it is their delight as the\r\n    Egyptians, so do they; but nevertheless God in his own good time\r\n    will bring them out by a mighty hand, as it is recorded in the\r\n    sacred oracles of truth, that Ethiopia shall soon stretch out\r\n    her hands to God, speaking in the positive (shall). And my\r\n    prayer is to you, oh, slaveholder, in the name of that God who\r\n    in the beginning said, Let there be light, and there was light.\r\n    Let my People go that they may serve me; thereby good may come\r\n    unto thee and to thy children's children. Slave-holder have you\r\n    seriously thought upon the condition yourselves, family and\r\n    slaves; have you read where Christ has enjoined upon all his\r\n    creatures to read his word, thereby that they may have no excuse\r\n    when coming before his judgment seat? But you say he shall not\r\n    read his word, consequently his sin will be upon your head. I\r\n    think every man has as much as he can do to answer for his own\r\n    sins. And now my dear-slave-holder, who with you are bound and\r\n    fast hastening to judgment? As one that loves your soul repent\r\n    ye, therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted\r\n    out when the time of refreshing shall come from the presence of\r\n    the Lord.\r\n\r\n    In the language of the poet:\r\n\r\n      Stop, poor sinner, stop and think,\r\n        Before you further go;\r\n      Think upon the brink of death\r\n        Of everlasting woe.\r\n      Say, have you an arm like God,\r\n        That you his will oppose?\r\n      Fear you not that iron rod\r\n        With which he breaks his foes?\r\n\r\n\r\n    Is the prayer of one that loves your souls.\r\n\r\n    EDMUND TURNER.\r\n\r\n    N.B. The signature bears the name of one who knows and felt the\r\n    sting of Slavery; but now, thanks be to God, I am now where the\r\n    poisonous breath taints not our air, but every one is sitting\r\n    under his own vine and fig tree, where none dare to make him\r\n    ashamed or afraid.\r\n\r\n    EDMUND TURNER, formerly of Petersburg, Va.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    HAMILTON, June 22d, 1858, C.W.\r\n\r\n    To MR. WM. STILL, DEAR SIR:--A favorable opportunity affords the\r\n    pleasure of acknowledging the receipt of letters and papers;\r\n    certainly in this region they were highly appreciated, and I\r\n    hope the time may come that your kindness will be reciprocated\r\n    we are al well at present, but times continue dull. I also\r\n    deeply regret the excitement recently on the account of those\r\n    slaves, you will favor me by keeping me posted upon the subject.\r\n    Those words written to slaveholder is the thought of one who had\r\n    sufferd, and now I thought it a duty incumbent upon me to cry\r\n    aloud and spare not, &c., by sending these few lines where the\r\n    slaveholder may hear. You will still further oblige your humble\r\n    servant also, to correct any inaccuracy. My respects to you and\r\n    your family and all inquiring friends.\r\n\r\n    Your friend and well wisher,\r\n\r\n    EDMUND TURNER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe then impending judgments seen by an eye of faith as set forth in\r\nthis \"Warning,\" soon fell with crushing weight upon the oppressor, and\r\nSlavery died. But the old blind father of Jackson, Isaac and Edmondson,\r\nstill lives and may be seen daily on the streets of Philadelphia; and\r\nthough \"halt, and lame, and blind, and poor,\" doubtless resulting from\r\nhis early oppression, he can thank God and rejoice that he has lived to\r\nsee Slavery abolished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT BROWN, ALIAS THOMAS JONES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROSSING THE RIVER ON HORSEBACK IN THE NIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn very desperate straits many new inventions were sought after by\r\ndeep-thinking and resolute slaves, determined to be free at any cost.\r\nBut it must here be admitted, that, in looking carefully over the more\r\nperilous methods resorted to, Robert Brown, alias Thomas Jones, stands\r\nsecond to none, with regard to deeds of bold daring. This hero escaped\r\nfrom Martinsburg, Va., in 1856. He was a man of medium size, mulatto,\r\nabout thirty-eight years of age, could read and write, and was naturally\r\nsharp-witted. He had formerly been owned by Col. John F. Franie, whom\r\nRobert charged with various offences of a serious domestic character.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, he also alleged, that his \"mistress was cruel to all the\r\nslaves,\" declaring that \"they (the slaves), could not live with her,\"\r\nthat \"she had to hire servants,\" etc.\r\n\r\nIn order to effect his escape, Robert was obliged to swim the Potomac\r\nriver on horseback, on Christmas night, while the cold, wind, storm, and\r\ndarkness were indescribably dismal. This daring bondman, rather than\r\nsubmit to his oppressor any longer, perilled his life as above stated.\r\nWhere he crossed the river was about a half a mile wide. Where could be\r\nfound in history a more noble and daring struggle for Freedom?\r\n\r\nThe wife of his bosom and his four children, only five days before he\r\nfled, were sold to a trader in Richmond, Va., for no other offence than\r\nsimply \"because she had resisted\" the lustful designs of her master,\r\nbeing \"true to her own companion.\" After this poor slave mother and her\r\nchildren were cast into prison for sale, the husband and some of his\r\nfriends tried hard to find a purchaser in the neighborhood; but the\r\nmalicious and brutal master refused to sell her--wishing to gratify his\r\nmalice to the utmost, and to punish his victims all that lay in his\r\npower, he sent them to the place above named.\r\n\r\nIn this trying hour, the severed and bleeding heart of the husband\r\nresolved to escape at all hazards, taking with him a daguerreotype\r\nlikeness of his wife which he happened to have on hand, and a lock of\r\nhair from her head, and from each of the children, as mementoes of his\r\nunbounded (though sundered) affection for them.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the river, his wet clothing freezing to him, he rode all\r\nnight, a distance of about forty miles. In the morning he left his\r\nfaithful horse tied to a fence, quite broken down. He then commenced his\r\ndreary journey on foot--cold and hungry--in a strange place, where it\r\nwas quite unsafe to make known his condition and wants. Thus for a day\r\nor two, without food or shelter, he traveled until his feet were\r\nliterally worn out, and in this condition he arrived at Harrisburg,\r\nwhere he found friends. Passing over many of the interesting incidents\r\non the road, suffice it to say, he arrived safely in this city, on New\r\nYear's night, 1857, about two hours before day break (the telegraph\r\nhaving announced his coming from Harrisburg), having been a week on the\r\nway. The night he arrived was very cold; besides, the Underground train,\r\nthat morning, was about three hours behind time; in waiting for it,\r\nentirely out in the cold, a member of the Vigilance Committee thought he\r\nwas frosted. But when he came to listen to the story of the Fugitive's\r\nsufferings, his mind changed.\r\n\r\nScarcely had Robert entered the house of one of the Committee, where he\r\nwas kindly received, when he took from his pocket his wife's likeness,\r\nspeaking very touchingly while gazing upon it and showing it.\r\nSubsequently, in speaking of his family, he showed the locks of hair\r\nreferred to, which he had carefully rolled up in paper separately.\r\nUnrolling them, he said, \"this is my wife's;\" \"this is from my oldest\r\ndaughter, eleven years old;\" \"and this is from my next oldest;\" \"and\r\nthis from the next,\" \"and this from my infant, only eight weeks old.\"\r\nThese mementoes he cherished with the utmost care as the last remains of\r\nhis affectionate family. At the sight of these locks of hair so tenderly\r\npreserved, the member of the Committee could fully appreciate the\r\nresolution of the fugitive in plunging into the Potomac, on the back of\r\na dumb beast, in order to flee from a place and people who had made such\r\nbarbarous havoc in his household.\r\n\r\nHis wife, as represented by the likeness, was of fair complexion,\r\nprepossessing, and good looking--perhaps not over thirty-three years of\r\nage.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANTHONY LONEY, ALIAS WILLIAM ARMSTEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnthony had been serving under the yoke of Warring Talvert, of Richmond,\r\nVa. Anthony was of a rich black complexion, medium size, about\r\ntwenty-five years of age. He was intelligent, and a member of the\r\nBaptist Church. His master was a member of the Presbyterian Church and\r\nheld family prayers with the servants. But Anthony believed seriously,\r\nthat his master was no more than a \"whitened sepulchre,\" one who was\r\nfond of saying, \"Lord, Lord,\" but did not do what the Lord bade him,\r\nconsequently Anthony felt, that before the Great Judge his \"master's\r\nmany prayers\" would not benefit him, as long as he continued to hold his\r\nfellow-men in bondage. He left a father, Samuel Loney, and mother,\r\nRebecca also, one sister and four brothers. His old father had bought\r\nhimself and was free; likewise his mother, being very old, had been\r\nallowed to go free. Anthony escaped in May, 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORNELIUS SCOTT.\r\n\r\n\r\nCornelius took passage _per_ the Underground Rail Road, in March, 1857,\r\nfrom the neighborhood of Salvington, Stafford county, Va. He stated that\r\nhe had been claimed by Henry L. Brooke, whom he declared to be a \"hard\r\ndrinker and a hard swearer.\" Cornelius had been very much bleached by\r\nthe Patriarchal Institution, and he was shrewd enough to take advantage\r\nof this circumstance. In regions of country where men were less critical\r\nand less experienced than Southerners, as to how the bleaching process\r\nwas brought about, Cornelius Scott would have had no difficulty whatever\r\nin passing for a white man of the most improved Anglo-Saxon type.\r\nAlthough a young man only twenty-three years of age, and quite stout,\r\nhis fair complexion was decidedly against him. He concluded, that for\r\nthis very reason, he would not have been valued at more than five\r\nhundred dollars in the market. He left his mother (Ann Stubbs, and half\r\nbrother, Isaiah), and traveled as a white man.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL WILLIAMS, ALIAS JOHN WILLIAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis candidate for Canada had the good fortune to escape the clutches of\r\nhis mistress, Mrs. Elvina Duncans, widow of the late Rev. James Duncans,\r\nwho lived near Cumberland, Md. He had very serious complaints to allege\r\nagainst his mistress, \"who was a member of the Presbyterian Church.\" To\r\nuse his own language, \"the servants in the house were treated worse than\r\ndogs.\" John was thirty-two years of age, dark chestnut color, well made,\r\nprepossessing in appearance, and he \"fled to keep from being sold.\" With\r\nthe Underground Rail Road he was \"highly delighted.\" Nor was he less\r\npleased with the thought, that he had caused his mistress, who was \"one\r\nof the worst women who ever lived,\" to lose twelve hundred dollars by\r\nhim. He escaped in March, 1857. He did not admit that he loved slavery\r\nany the better for the reason that his master was a preacher, or that\r\nhis mistress was the wife of a preacher. Although a common farm hand,\r\nSamuel had common sense, and for a long time previous had been watching\r\nclosely the conduct of his mistress, and at the same time had been\r\nlaying his plans for escaping on the Underground Rail Road the first\r\nchance.\r\n\r\n\r\n    $100 REWARD!--My negro man Richard has been missing since Sunday\r\n    night, March 22d. I will give $100 to any one who will secure\r\n    him or deliver him to me. Richard is thirty years old, but looks\r\n    older; very short legs, dark, but rather bright color, broad\r\n    cheek bones, a respectful and serious manner, generally looks\r\n    away when spoken to, small moustache and beard (but he may have\r\n    them off). He is a remarkably intelligent man, and can turn his\r\n    hand to anything. He took with him a bag made of Brussels\r\n    carpet, with my name written in large, rough letters on the\r\n    bottom, and a good stock of coarse and fine clothes, among them\r\n    a navy cap and a low-crowned hat. He has been seen about New\r\n    Kent C.H., and on the Pamunky river, and is no doubt trying to\r\n    get off in some vessel bound North.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    April 18th, 1857.\r\n\r\n    J.W. RANDOLPH, Richmond, Va.\r\n\r\n    Even at this late date, it may perhaps afford Mr. R. a degree of\r\n    satisfaction to know what became of Richard; but if this should\r\n    not be the case, Richard's children, or mother, or father, if\r\n    they are living, may possibly see these pages, and thereby be\r\n    made glad by learning of Richard's wisdom as a traveler, in the\r\n    terrible days of slave-hunting. Consequently here is what was\r\n    recorded of him, April 3d, 1857, at the Underground Rail Road\r\n    Station, just before a free ticket was tendered him for Canada.\r\n    \"Richard is thirty-three years of age, small of stature, dark\r\n    color, smart and resolute. He was owned by Captain Tucker, of\r\n    the United States Navy, from whom he fled.\" He was \"tired of\r\n    serving, and wanted to marry,\" was the cause of his escape. He\r\n    had no complaint of bad treatment to make against his owner;\r\n    indeed he said, that he had been \"used well all his life.\"\r\n    Nevertheless, Richard felt that this Underground Rail Road was\r\n    the \"greatest road he ever saw.\"\r\n\r\n    When the war broke out, Richard girded on his knapsack and went\r\n    to help Uncle Sam humble Richmond and break the yoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBARNABY GRIGBY, ALIAS JOHN BOYER, AND MARY ELIZABETH, HIS WIFE; FRANK\r\nWANZER, ALIAS ROBERT SCOTT; EMILY FOSTER, ALIAS ANN WOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(TWO OTHERS WHO STARTED WITH THEM WERE CAPTURED.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these persons journeyed together from Loudon Co., Va. on horseback\r\nand in a carriage for more than one hundred miles. Availing themselves\r\nof a holiday and their master's horses and carriage, they as\r\ndeliberately started for Canada, as though they had never been taught\r\nthat it was their duty, as servants, to \"obey their masters.\" In this\r\nparticular showing a most utter disregard of the interest of their\r\n\"kind-hearted and indulgent owners.\" They left home on Monday, Christmas\r\nEve, 1855, under the leadership of Frank Wanzer, and arrived in Columbia\r\nthe following Wednesday at one o'clock. As willfully as they had thus\r\nmade their way along, they had not found it smooth sailing by any means.\r\nThe biting frost and snow rendered their travel anything but agreeable.\r\nNor did they escape the gnawings of hunger, traveling day and night. And\r\nwhilst these \"articles\" were in the very act of running away with\r\nthemselves and their kind master's best horses and carriage--when about\r\none hundred miles from home, in the neighborhood of Cheat river,\r\nMaryland, they were attacked by \"six white men, and a boy,\" who,\r\ndoubtless, supposing that their intentions were of a \"wicked and\r\nunlawful character\" felt it to be their duty in kindness to their\r\nmasters, if not to the travelers to demand of them an account of\r\nthemselves. In other words, the assailants positively commanded the\r\nfugitives to \"show what right\" they possessed, to be found in a\r\ncondition apparently so unwarranted.\r\n\r\nThe _spokesman_ amongst the fugitives, affecting no ordinary amount of\r\ndignity, told their assailants plainly, that \"no gentleman would\r\ninterfere with persons riding along civilly\"--not allowing it to be\r\nsupposed that they were slaves, of course. These \"gentlemen,\" however,\r\nwere not willing to accept this account of the travelers, as their very\r\ndecided steps indicated. Having the law on their side, they were for\r\ncompelling the fugitives to surrender without further parley.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, the fugitives verily believing that the time had\r\narrived for the practical use of their pistols and dirks, pulled them\r\nout of their concealment--the young women as well as the young men--and\r\ndeclared they would not be \"taken!\" One of the white men raised his gun,\r\npointing the muzzle directly towards one of the young women, with the\r\nthreat that he would \"shoot,\" etc. \"Shoot! shoot!! shoot!!!\" she\r\nexclaimed, with a double barrelled pistol in one hand and a long dirk\r\nknife in the other, utterly unterrified and fully ready for a death\r\nstruggle. The male _leader_ of the fugitives by this time had \"pulled\r\nback the hammers\" of his \"pistols,\" and was about to fire! Their\r\nadversaries seeing the weapons, and the unflinching determination on the\r\npart of the _runaways_ to stand their ground, \"spill blood, kill, or\r\ndie,\" rather than be \"taken,\" very prudently \"sidled over to the other\r\nside of the road,\" leaving at least four of the victors to travel on\r\ntheir way.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the four in the carriage lost sight of the two on\r\nhorseback. Soon after the separation they heard firing, but what the\r\nresult was, they knew not. They were fearful, however, that their\r\ncompanions had been captured.\r\n\r\nThe following paragraph, which was shortly afterwards taken from a\r\nSouthern paper, leaves no room to doubt, as to the fate of the two.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Six fugitive slaves from Virginia were arrested at the Maryland\r\n    line, near Hood's Mill, on Christmas day, but, after a severe\r\n    fight, four of them escaped and have not since been heard of.\r\n    They came from Loudoun and Fauquier counties.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n\r\nThough the four who were successful, saw no \"severe fight,\" it is not\r\nunreasonable to suppose, that there was a fight, nevertheless; but not\r\ntill after the number of the fugitives had been reduced to two, instead\r\nof six. As chivalrous as slave-holders and slave-catchers were, they\r\nknew the value of their precious lives and the fearful risk of\r\nattempting a capture, when the numbers were equal.\r\n\r\nThe party in the carriage, after the conflict, went on their way\r\nrejoicing.\r\n\r\nThe young men, one cold night, when they were compelled to take rest in\r\nthe woods and snow, in vain strove to keep the feet of their female\r\ncompanions from freezing by lying on them; but the frost was merciless\r\nand bit them severely, as their feet very plainly showed. The following\r\ndisjointed report was cut from the _Frederick (Md.) Examiner_, soon\r\nafter the occurrence took place:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Six slaves, four men and two women, fugitives from Virginia,\r\n    having with them two spring wagons and four horses, came to\r\n    Hood's Mill, on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, near the\r\n    dividing line between Frederick and Carroll counties, on\r\n    Christmas day. After feeding their animals, one of them told a\r\n    Mr. Dixon whence they came; believing them to be fugitives, he\r\n    spread the alarm, and some eight or ten persons gathered round\r\n    to arrest them; but the negroes drawing revolvers and\r\n    bowie-knives, kept their assailants at bay, until five of the\r\n    party succeeded in escaping in one of the wagons, and as the\r\n    last one jumped on a horse to flee, he was fired at, the load\r\n    taking effect in the small of the back. The prisoner says he\r\n    belongs to Charles W. Simpson, Esq., of Fauquier county, Va.,\r\n    and ran away with the others on the preceding evening.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis report from the _Examiner_, while it is not wholly correct,\r\nevidently relates to the fugitives above described. Why the reporter\r\nmade such glaring mistakes, may be accounted for on the ground that the\r\nbold stand made by the fugitives was so bewildering and alarming, that\r\nthe \"assailants\" were not in a proper condition to make correct\r\nstatements. Nevertheless the _Examiner's_ report was preserved with\r\nother records, and is here given for what it is worth.\r\n\r\nThese victors were individually noted on the Record thus: Barnaby was\r\nowned by William Rogers, a farmer, who was considered a \"moderate\r\nslaveholder,\" although of late \"addicted to intemperance.\" He was the\r\nowner of about one \"dozen head of slaves,\" and had besides a wife and\r\ntwo children.\r\n\r\nBarnaby's chances for making extra \"change\" for himself were never\r\nfavorable; sometimes of \"nights\" he would manage to earn a \"trifle.\" He\r\nwas prompted to escape because he \"wanted to live by the sweat of his\r\nown brow,\" believing that all men ought so to live. This was the only\r\nreason he gave for fleeing.\r\n\r\nMary Elizabeth had been owned by Townsend McVee (likewise a farmer), and\r\nin Mary's judgment, he was \"severe,\" but she added, \"his wife made him\r\nso.\" McVee owned about twenty-five slaves; \"he hardly allowed them to\r\ntalk--would not allow them to raise chickens,\" and \"only allowed Mary\r\nthree dresses a year;\" the rest she had to get as she could. Sometimes\r\nMcVee would sell slaves--last year he sold two. Mary said that she could\r\nnot say anything good of her mistress. On the contrary, she declared\r\nthat her mistress \"knew no mercy nor showed any favor.\"\r\n\r\nIt was on account of this \"domineering spirit,\" that Mary was induced to\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nFrank was owned by Luther Sullivan, \"the meanest man in Virginia,\" he\r\nsaid; he treated his people just as bad as he could in every respect.\r\n\"Sullivan,\" added Frank, \"would 'lowance the slaves and stint them to\r\nsave food and get rich,\" and \"would sell and whip,\" etc. To Frank's\r\nknowledge, he had sold some twenty-five head. \"He sold my mother and her\r\ntwo children to Georgia some four years previous.\" But the motive which\r\nhurried Frank to make his flight was his laboring under the apprehension\r\nthat his master had some \"pretty heavy creditors who might come on him\r\nat any time.\" Frank, therefore, wanted to be from home in Canada when\r\nthese gentry should make their visit. My poor mother has been often\r\nflogged by master, said Frank. As to his mistress, he said she was\r\n\"tolerably good.\"\r\n\r\nAnn Wood was owned by McVee also, and was own sister to Elizabeth. Ann\r\nvery fully sustained her sister Elizabeth's statement respecting the\r\ncharacter of her master.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned four, were all young and likely. Barnaby was\r\ntwenty-six years of age, mulatto, medium size, and intelligent--his wife\r\nwas about twenty-four years of age, quite dark, good-looking, and of\r\npleasant appearance. Frank was twenty-five years of age, mulatto, and\r\nvery smart; Ann was twenty-two, good-looking, and smart. After their\r\npressing wants had been met by the Vigilance Committee, and after\r\npartial recuperation from their hard travel, etc., they were forwarded\r\non to the Vigilance Committee in New York. In Syracuse, Frank (the\r\nleader), who was engaged to Emily, concluded that the knot might as well\r\nbe tied on the U.G.R.R., although penniless, as to delay the matter a\r\nsingle day longer. Doubtless, the bravery, struggles, and trials of\r\nEmily throughout the journey, had, in his estimation, added not a little\r\nto her charms. Thus after consulting with her on the matter, her\r\napproval was soon obtained, she being too prudent and wise to refuse the\r\nhand of one who had proved himself so true a friend to Freedom, as well\r\nas so devoted to her. The twain were accordingly made one at the\r\nU.G.R.R. Station, in Syracuse, by Superintendent--Rev. J.W. Loguen.\r\nAfter this joyful event, they proceeded to Toronto, and were there\r\ngladly received by the Ladies' Society for aiding colored refugees.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from Mrs. Agnes Willis, wife of the distinguished\r\nRev. Dr. Willis, brought the gratifying intelligence that these brave\r\nyoung adventurers, fell into the hands of distinguished characters and\r\nwarm friends of Freedom:\r\n\r\n\r\n    TORONTO, 28th January, Monday evening, 1856.\r\n\r\n    MR. STILL, DEAR SIR:--I have very great pleasure in making you\r\n    aware that the following respectable persons have arrived here\r\n    in safety without being annoyed in any way after you saw them.\r\n    The women, two of them, viz: Mrs. Greegsby and Mrs. Graham, have\r\n    been rather ailing, but we hope they will very soon be well.\r\n    They have been attended to by the Ladies' Society, and are most\r\n    grateful for any attention they have received. The solitary\r\n    person, Mrs. Graves, has also been attended to; also her box\r\n    will be looked after. She is pretty well, but rather dull;\r\n    however, she will get friends and feel more at home by and bye.\r\n    Mrs. Wanzer is quite well; and also young William Henry\r\n    Sanderson. They are all of them in pretty good spirits, and I\r\n    have no doubt they will succeed in whatever business they take\r\n    up. In the mean time the men are chopping wood, and the ladies\r\n    are getting plenty sewing. We are always glad to see our colored\r\n    refugees safe here. I remain, dear sir,\r\n\r\n    yours respectfully,\r\n\r\n    AGNES WILLIS,\r\n\r\n    Treasurer to the Ladies' Society to aid colored refugees.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a time Frank enjoyed his newly won freedom and happy bride with\r\nbright prospects all around; but the thought of having left sisters and\r\nother relatives in bondage was a source of sadness in the midst of his\r\njoy. He was not long, however, in making up his mind that he would\r\ndeliver them or \"die in the attempt.\" Deliberately forming his plans to\r\ngo South, he resolved to take upon himself the entire responsibility of\r\nall the risks to be encountered. Not a word did he reveal to a living\r\nsoul of what he was about to undertake. With \"twenty-two dollars\" in\r\ncash and \"three pistols\" in his pockets, he started in the lightning\r\ntrain from Toronto for Virginia. On reaching Columbia in this State, he\r\ndeemed it not safe to go any further by public conveyance, consequently\r\nhe commenced his long journey on foot, and as he neared the slave\r\nterritory he traveled by night altogether. For two weeks, night and day,\r\nhe avoided trusting himself in any house, consequently was compelled to\r\nlodge in the woods. Nevertheless, during that space of time he succeeded\r\nin delivering one of his sisters and her husband, and another friend in\r\nthe bargain. You can scarcely imagine the Committee's amazement on his\r\nreturn, as they looked upon him and listened to his \"noble deeds of\r\ndaring\" and his triumph. A more brave and self-possessed man they had\r\nnever seen.\r\n\r\nHe knew what Slavery was and the dangers surrounding him on his mission,\r\nbut possessing true courage unlike most men, he pictured no alarming\r\ndifficulties in a distance of nearly one thousand miles by the mail\r\nroute, through the enemy's country, where he might have in truth said,\r\n\"I could not pass without running the gauntlet of mobs and assassins,\r\nprisons and penitentiaries, bailiffs and constables, &c.\" If this hero\r\nhad dwelt upon and magnified the obstacles in his way he would most\r\nassuredly have kept off the enemy's country, and his sister and friends\r\nwould have remained in chains.\r\n\r\nThe following were the persons delivered by Frank Wanzer. They were his\r\ntrophies, and this noble act of Frank's should ever be held as a\r\nmemorial and honor. The Committee's brief record made on their arrival\r\nruns thus:\r\n\r\n\"August 18, 1856. Frank Wanzer, Robert Stewart, alias Gasberry Robison,\r\nVincent Smith, alias John Jackson, Betsey Smith, wife of Vincent Smith,\r\nalias Fanny Jackson. They all came from Alder, Loudon county, Virginia.\"\r\n\r\nRobert is about thirty years of age, medium size, dark chestnut color,\r\nintelligent and resolute. He was held by the widow Hutchinson, who was\r\nalso the owner of about one hundred others. Robert regarded her as a\r\n\"very hard mistress\" until the death of her husband, which took place\r\nthe Fall previous to his escape. That sad affliction, he thought, was\r\nthe cause of a considerable change in her treatment of her slaves. But\r\nyet \"nothing was said about freedom,\" on her part. This reticence Robert\r\nunderstood to mean, that she was still unconverted on this great\r\ncardinal principle at least. As he could see no prospect of freedom\r\nthrough her agency, when Frank approached him with a good report from\r\nCanada and his friends there, he could scarcely wait to listen to the\r\nglorious news; he was so willing and anxious to get out of slavery. His\r\ndear old mother, Sarah Davis, and four brothers and two sisters,\r\nWilliam, Thomas, Frederick and Samuel, Violet and Ellen, were all owned\r\nby Mrs. Hutchinson. Dear as they were to him, he saw no way to take them\r\nwith him, nor was he prepared to remain a day longer under the yoke; so\r\nhe decided to accompany Frank, let the cost be what it might.\r\n\r\nVincent is about twenty-three years of age, very \"likely-looking,\" dark\r\ncolor, and more than ordinarily intelligent for one having only the\r\ncommon chances of slaves.\r\n\r\nHe was owned by the estate of Nathan Skinner, who was \"looked upon,\" by\r\nthose who knew him, \"as a good slave-holder.\" In slave property,\r\nhowever, he was only interested to the number of twelve head. Skinner\r\n\"neither sold nor emancipated.\" A year and a half before Vincent\r\nescaped, his master was called to give an account of his stewardship,\r\nand there in the spirit land Vincent was willing to let him remain,\r\nwithout much more to add about him.\r\n\r\nVincent left his mother, Judah Smith, and brothers and sisters, Edwin,\r\nAngeline, Sina Ann, Adaline Susan, George, John and Lewis, all belonging\r\nto the estate of Skinner.\r\n\r\nVincent was fortunate enough to bring his wife along with him. She was\r\nabout twenty-seven years of age, of a brown color, and smart, and was\r\nowned by the daughter of the widow Hutchinson. This mistress was said to\r\nbe a \"clever woman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM JORDON, ALIAS WILLIAM PRICE\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder Governor Badger, of North Carolina, William had experienced\r\nSlavery in its most hateful form. True, he had only been twelve months\r\nunder the yoke of this high functionary. But William's experience in\r\nthis short space of time, was of a nature very painful.\r\n\r\nPrevious to coming into the governor's hands, William was held as the\r\nproperty of Mrs. Mary Jordon, who owned large numbers of slaves. Whether\r\nthe governor was moved by this consideration, or by the fascinating\r\ncharms of Mrs. Jordon, or both, William was not able to decide. But the\r\ngovernor offered her his hand, and they became united in wedlock. By\r\nthis circumstance, William was brought into his unhappy relations with\r\nthe Chief Magistrate of the State of North Carolina. This was the third\r\ntime the governor had been married. Thus it may be seen, that the\r\ngovernor was a firm believer in wives as well as slaves. Commonly he was\r\nregarded as a man of wealth. William being an intelligent piece of\r\nproperty, his knowledge of the governor's rules and customs was quite\r\ncomplete, as he readily answered such questions as were propounded to\r\nhim. In this way a great amount of interesting information was learned\r\nfrom William respecting the governor, slaves, on the plantation, in the\r\nswamps, etc. The governor owned large plantations, and was interested in\r\nraising cotton, corn, and peas, and was also a practical planter. He was\r\nwilling to trust neither overseers nor slaves any further than he could\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\nThe governor and his wife were both equally severe towards them; would\r\nstint them shamefully in clothing and food, though they did not get\r\nflogged quite as often as some others on neighboring plantations.\r\nFrequently, the governor would be out on the plantation from early in\r\nthe morning till noon, inspecting the operations of the overseers and\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nIn order to serve the governor, William had been separated from his wife\r\nby sale, which was the cause of his escape. He parted not with his\r\ncompanion willingly. At the time, however, he was promised that he\r\nshould have some favors shown him;--could make over-work, and earn a\r\nlittle money, and once or twice in the year, have the opportunity of\r\nmaking visits to her. Two hundred miles was the distance between them.\r\n\r\nHe had not been long on the governor's plantation before his honor gave\r\nhim distinctly to understand that the idea of his going two hundred\r\nmiles to see his wife was all nonsense, and entirely out of the\r\nquestion. \"If I said so, I did not mean it,\" said his honor, when the\r\nslave, on a certain occasion, alluded to the conditions on which he\r\nconsented to leave home, etc.\r\n\r\nAgainst this cruel decision of the governor, William's heart revolted,\r\nfor he was warmly attached to his wife, and so he made up his mind, if\r\nhe could not see her \"once or twice a year even,\" as he had been\r\npromised, he had rather \"die,\" or live in a \"cave in the wood,\" than to\r\nremain all his life under the governor's yoke. Obeying the dictates of\r\nhis feelings, he went to the woods. For ten months before he was\r\nsuccessful in finding the Underground Road, this brave-hearted young\r\nfugitive abode in the swamps--three months in a cave--surrounded with\r\nbears, wild cats, rattle-snakes and the like.\r\n\r\nWhile in the swamps and cave, he was not troubled, however, about\r\nferocious animals and venomous reptiles. He feared only man!\r\n\r\nFrom his own story there was no escaping the conclusion, that if the\r\nchoice had been left to him, he would have preferred at any time to have\r\nencountered at the mouth of his cave a ferocious bear than his master,\r\nthe governor of North Carolina. How he managed to subsist, and\r\nultimately effected his escape, was listened to with the deepest\r\ninterest, though the recital of these incidents must here be very brief.\r\n\r\nAfter night he would come out of his cave, and, in some instances, would\r\nsucceed in making his way to a plantation, and if he could get nothing\r\nelse, he would help himself to a \"pig,\" or anything else he could\r\nconveniently convert into food. Also, as opportunity would offer, a\r\nfriend of his would favor him with some meal, etc. With this mode of\r\nliving he labored to content himself until he could do better. During\r\nthese ten months he suffered indescribable hardships, but he felt that\r\nhis condition in the cave was far preferable to that on the plantation,\r\nunder the control of his Excellency, the Governor. All this time,\r\nhowever, William had a true friend, with whom he could communicate; one\r\nwho was wide awake, and was on the alert to find a reliable captain from\r\nthe North, who would consent to take this \"property,\" or \"freight,\" for\r\na consideration. He heard at last of a certain Captain, who was then\r\ndoing quite a successful business in an Underground way. This good news\r\nwas conveyed to William, and afforded him a ray of hope in the\r\nwilderness. As Providence would have it, his hope did not meet with\r\ndisappointment; nor did his ten months' trial, warring against the\r\nbarbarism of Slavery, seem too great to endure for Freedom. He was about\r\nto leave his cave and his animal and reptile neighbors,--his heart\r\nswelling with gladness,--but the thought of soon being beyond the reach\r\nof his mistress and master thrilled him with inexpressible delight. He\r\nwas brought away by Captain F., and turned over to the Committee, who\r\nwere made to rejoice with him over the signal victory he had gained in\r\nhis martyr-like endeavors to throw off the yoke, and of course they took\r\nmuch pleasure in aiding him. William was of a dark color, stout made\r\nphysically, and well knew the value of Freedom, and how to hate and\r\ncombat Slavery. It will be seen by the appended letter of Thomas\r\nGarrett, that William had the good luck to fall into the hands of this\r\ntried friend, by whom he was aided to Philadelphia:\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILMINGTON, 12th mo., 19th, 1855.\r\n\r\n    DEAR FRIEND, WILLIAM STILL:--The bearer of this is one of the\r\n    twenty-one that I thought had all gone North; he left home on\r\n    Christmas day, one year since, wandered about the forests of\r\n    North Carolina for about ten months, and then came here with\r\n    those forwarded to New Bedford, where he is anxious to go. I\r\n    have furnished him with a pretty good pair of boots, and gave\r\n    him money to pay his passage to Philadelphia. He has been at\r\n    work in the country near here for some three weeks, till taken\r\n    sick; he is, by no means, well, but thinks he had better try to\r\n    get farther North, which I hope his friends in Philadelphia will\r\n    aid him to do. I handed this morning Captain Lambson's[A] wife\r\n    twenty dollars to help fee a lawyer to defend him. She leaves\r\n    this morning, with her child, for Norfolk, to be at the trial\r\n    before the Commissioner on the 24th instant. Passmore Williamson\r\n    agreed to raise fifty dollars for him. As none came to hand, and\r\n    a good chance to send it by his wife, I thought best to advance\r\n    that much.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote A: Captain Lambson had been suspected of having aided\r\n    in the escape of slaves from the neighborhood of Norfolk, and\r\n    was in prison awaiting his trial.]\r\n\r\n    Thy friend,\r\n\r\n    THOS. GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH GRANT AND JOHN SPEAKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO PASSENGERS ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD, VIA LIVERPOOL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that, owing to circumstances, the account of these\r\npersons has not been fully preserved. Could justice be done them,\r\nprobably their narratives would not be surpassed in interest by any\r\nother in the history of fugitives. In 1857, when these remarkable\r\ntravelers came under the notice of the Vigilance Committee, as Slavery\r\nseemed likely to last for generations, and there was but little\r\nexpectation that these records would ever have the historical value\r\nwhich they now possess, care was not always taken to prepare and\r\npreserve them. Besides, the cases coming under the notice of the\r\nCommittee, were so numerous and so interesting, that it seemed almost\r\nimpossible to do them anything like justice. In many instances the rapt\r\nattention paid by friends, when listening to the sad recitals of such\r\npassengers, would unavoidably consume so much time that but little\r\nopportunity was afforded to make any record of them. Particularly was\r\nthis the case with regard to the above-mentioned individuals. The story\r\nof each was so long and sad, that a member of the Committee in\r\nattempting to write it out, found that the two narratives would take\r\nvolumes. That all traces, of these heroes might not be lost, a mere\r\nfragment is all that was preserved.\r\n\r\nThe original names of these adventurers, were Joseph Grant and John\r\nSpeaks. Between two and three years before escaping, they were sold from\r\nMaryland to John B. Campbell a negro trader, living in Baltimore, and\r\nthence to Campbell's brother, another trader in New Orleans, and\r\nsubsequently to Daniel McBeans and Mr. Henry, of Harrison county,\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nThough both had to pass through nearly the same trial, and belonged to\r\nthe same masters, this recital must be confined chiefly to the incidents\r\nin the career of Joseph. He was about twenty-seven years of age, well\r\nmade, quite black, intelligent and self-possessed in his manner.\r\n\r\nHe was owned in Maryland by Mrs. Mary Gibson, who resided at St.\r\nMichael's on the Eastern Shore. She was a _nice woman_ he said, but her\r\nproperty was under mortgage and had to be sold, and he was in danger of\r\nsharing the same fate.\r\n\r\nJoseph was a married man, and spoke tenderly of his wife. She \"promised\"\r\nhim when he was sold that she would \"never marry,\" and earnestly\r\nentreated him, if he \"ever met with the luck, to come and see her.\" She\r\nwas unaware perhaps at that time of the great distance that was to\r\ndivide them; his feelings on being thus sundered need not be stated.\r\nHowever, he had scarcely been in Mississippi three weeks, ere his desire\r\nto return to his wife, and the place of his nativity constrained him to\r\nattempt to return; accordingly he set off, crossing a lake eighty miles\r\nwide in a small boat, he reached Kent Island. There he was captured by\r\nthe watchman on the Island, who with _pistols, dirk and cutlass_ in\r\nhand, threatened if he resisted that death would be his instant doom. Of\r\ncourse he was returned to his master.\r\n\r\nHe remained there a few months, but could content himself no longer to\r\nendure the ills of his condition. So he again started for home, walked\r\nto Mobile, and thence he succeeded in stowing himself away in a\r\nsteamboat and was thus conveyed to Montgomery, a distance of five\r\nhundred and fifty miles through solid slave territory. Again he was\r\ncaptured and returned to his owners; one of whom always went for\r\nimmediate punishment, the other being mild thought persuasion the better\r\nplan in such cases. On the whole, Joseph thus far had been pretty\r\nfortunate, considering the magnitude of his offence.\r\n\r\nA third time he summoned courage and steered his course homewards\r\ntowards Maryland, but as in the preceding attempts, he was again\r\nunsuccessful.\r\n\r\nIn this instance Mr. Henry, the harsh owner, was exasperated, and the\r\nmild one's patience so exhausted that they concluded that nothing short\r\nof stern measures would cause Joe to reform. Said Mr. Henry; \"_I had\r\nrather lose my right arm than for him to get off without being punished,\r\nafter having put us to so much trouble_.\"\r\n\r\n_Joseph_ will now speak for himself.\r\n\r\n\"He (master) sent the overseer to tie me. I told him I would not be\r\ntied. I ran and stayed away four days, which made Mr. Henry very\r\nanxious. Mr. Beans told the servants if they saw me, to tell me to come\r\nback and I should not be hurt. Thinking that Mr. Beans had always stood\r\nto his word, I was over persuaded and came back. He sent for me in his\r\nparlor, talked the matter over, sent me to the steamboat (perhaps the\r\none he tried to escape on.) After getting cleverly on board the captain\r\ntold me, I am sorry to tell you, you have to be tied. I was tied and Mr.\r\nHenry was sent for. He came; 'Well, I have got you at last, beg my\r\npardon and promise you will never run away again and I will not be so\r\nhard on you.' I could not do it. He then gave me three hundred lashes\r\nwell laid on. I was stripped entirely naked, and my flesh was as raw as\r\na piece of beef. He made John (the companion who escaped with him) hold\r\none of my feet which I broke loose while being whipped, and when done\r\nmade him bathe me in salt and water.\r\n\r\n\"Then I resolved to 'go or die' in the attempt. Before starting, one\r\nweek, I could not work. On getting better we went to Ship Island; the\r\nsailors, who were Englishmen, were very sorry to hear of the treatment\r\nwe had received, and counselled us how we might get free.\"\r\n\r\nThe counsel was heeded, and in due time they found themselves in\r\nLiverpool. There their stay was brief. Utterly destitute of money,\r\neducation, and in a strange land, they very naturally turned their eyes\r\nagain in the direction of their native land. Accordingly their host, the\r\nkeeper of a sailor's boarding-house, shipped them to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nBut to go back, Joseph saw many things in New Orleans and Mississippi of\r\na nature too horrible to relate, among which were the following:\r\n\r\nI have seen Mr. Beans whip one of his slaves to death, at the tree to\r\nwhich he was tied.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry would make them lie down across a log, stripped naked, and\r\nwith every stroke would lay the flesh open. Being used to it, some would\r\nlie on the log without being tied.\r\n\r\nIn New Orleans, I have seen women stretched out just as naked as my\r\nhand, on boxes, and given one hundred and fifty lashes, four men holding\r\nthem. I have helped hold them myself: when released they could hardly\r\nsit or walk. This whipping was at the \"_Fancy House_.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"chain-gangs\" he also saw in constant operation. Four and five\r\nslaves chained together and at work on the streets, cleaning, &c., was a\r\ncommon sight. He could hardly tell Sunday from Monday in New Orleans,\r\nthe slaves were kept so constantly going.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM N. TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD.--Ran away from Richmond City on\r\n    Tuesday, the 2d of June, a negro man named WM. N. TAYLOR,\r\n    belonging to Mrs. Margaret Tyler of Hanover county.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    Said negro was hired to Fitzhugh Mayo, Tobacconist; is quite\r\n    black, of genteel and easy manners, about five feet ten or\r\n    eleven inches high, has one front tooth broken, and is about 35\r\n    years old.\r\n\r\n    He is supposed either to have made his escape North, or\r\n    attempted to do so. The above reward will be paid for his\r\n    delivery to Messrs. Hill and Rawlings, in Richmond, or secured\r\n    in jail, so that I get him again.\r\n\r\n    JAS. G. TYLER, Trustee for Margaret Tyler.\r\n\r\n    June 8th &c2t--\r\n\r\n    _Richmond Enquirer, June 9, 57_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam unquestionably possessed a fair share of common sense, and just\r\nenough distaste to Slavery to arouse him most resolutely to seek his\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nThe advertisement of James G. Tyler was not altogether accurate with\r\nregard to his description of William; but notwithstanding, in handing\r\nWilliam down to posterity, the description of Tyler has been adopted\r\ninstead of the one engrossed in the records by the Committee. But as a\r\nsimple matter of fair play, it seems fitting, that the description given\r\nby William, while on the Underground Rail Road, of his master, &c.,\r\nshould come in just here.\r\n\r\nWilliam acknowledged that he was the property of Walter H. Tyler,\r\nbrother of EX-PRESIDENT TYLER, who was described as follows: \"He\r\n(master) was about sixty-five years of age; was a barbarous man, very\r\nintemperate, horse racer, chicken-cock fighter and gambler. He had owned\r\nas high as forty head of slaves, but he had gambled them all away. He\r\nwas a doctor, circulated high amongst southerners, though he never lived\r\nagreeably with his wife, would curse her and call her all kinds of names\r\nthat he should not call a lady. From a boy of nine up to the time I was\r\nfifteen or sixteen, I don't reckon he whipped me less than a hundred\r\ntimes. He shot at me once with a double-barrelled gun.\r\n\r\n\"What made me leave was because I worked for him all my life-time and he\r\nnever gave me but two dollars and fifteen cents in all his life. I was\r\nhired out this year for two hundred dollars, but when I would go to him\r\nto make complaints of hard treatment from the man I was hired to, he\r\nwould say: \"G----d d----n it, don't come to me, all I want is my money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Tyler was a thin raw-boned man, with a long nose, the picture of\r\nthe president. His wife was a tolerably well-disposed woman in some\r\ninstances--she was a tall, thin-visaged woman, and stood high in the\r\ncommunity. Through her I fell into the hands of Tyler. At present she\r\nowns about fifty slaves. His own slaves, spoken of as having been\r\ngambled away, came by his father--he has been married the second time.\"\r\n\r\nTwice William had been sold and bought in, on account of his master's\r\ncreditors, and for many months had been expecting to be sold again, to\r\nmeet pressing claims in the hands of the sheriff against Tyler. He, by\r\nthe way, \"now lives in Hanover county, about eighteen miles from\r\nRichmond, and for fear of the sheriff, makes himself very scarce in that\r\ncity.\"\r\n\r\nAt fourteen years of age, William was sold for eight hundred dollars; he\r\nwould have brought in 1857, probably twelve hundred and fifty dollars;\r\nhe was a member of the Baptist Church in good and regular standing.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOUISA BROWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nLouisa is a good-looking, well-grown, intelligent mulatto girl of\r\nsixteen years of age, and was owned by a widow woman of Baltimore, Md.\r\nTo keep from being sold, she was prompted to try her fortune on the\r\nU.G.R.R., for Freedom in Canada, under the protection of the British\r\nLion.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJACOB WATERS AND ALFRED GOULDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nJacob is twenty-one years of age, dark chestnut color, medium size, and\r\nof prepossessing manners. Fled from near Frederick, Md., from the\r\nclutches of a farmer by the name of William Dorsey, who was described as\r\na severe master, and had sold two of Jacob's sisters, South, only three\r\nyears prior to his escape. Jacob left three brothers in chains.\r\n\r\nAlfred is twenty-three years of age, in stature quite small, full black,\r\nand bears the marks of ill usage. Though a member of the Methodist\r\nChurch, his master, Fletcher Jackson, \"thought nothing of taking the\r\nshovel to Alfred's head; or of knocking him, and stamping his head with\r\nthe heels of his boots.\" Repeatedly, of late, he had been shockingly\r\nbeaten. To escape those terrible visitations, therefore, he made up his\r\nmind to seek a refuge in Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM BALTIMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nJEFFERSON PIPKINS, ALIAS DAVID JONES, LOUISA PIPKINS, ELIZABETH BRIT,\r\nHARRIET BROWN, ALIAS JANE WOOTON, GRACY MURRY, ALIAS SOPHIA SIMS, EDWARD\r\nWILLIAMS, ALIAS HENRY JOHNSON, CHAS. LEE, ALIAS THOMAS BUSHIER.\r\n\r\n\r\nSix very clever-looking passengers, all in one party from Baltimore,\r\nMd., the first Sunday in April, 1853. Baltimore used to be in the days\r\nof Slavery one of the most difficult places in the South for even free\r\ncolored people to get away from, much more for slaves. The rule forbade\r\nany colored person leaving there by rail road or steamboat, without such\r\napplicant had been weighed, measured, and then given a bond signed by\r\nunquestionable signatures, well known. Baltimore was rigid in the\r\nextreme, and was a never-failing source of annoyance, trouble and\r\nexpense to colored people generally, and not unfrequently to\r\nslave-holders too, when they were traveling North with \"colored\r\nservants.\" Just as they were ready to start, the \"Rules\" would forbid\r\ncolored servants until the law was complied with. Parties hurrying on\r\nwould on account of this obstruction \"have to wait until their hurry was\r\nover.\" As this was all done in the interest of Slavery, the matter was\r\nnot very loudly condemned. But, notwithstanding all this weighing,\r\nmeasuring and requiring of bonds, many travelers by the Underground Rail\r\nRoad took passage from Baltimore.\r\n\r\nThe enterprising individual, whose name stands at the head of this\r\nnarrative, came directly from this stronghold of Slavery. The widow\r\nPipkins held the title deed for Jefferson. She was unfortunate in losing\r\nhim, as she was living in ease and luxury off of Jefferson's sweat and\r\nlabor. Louisa, Harriet and Grace owed service to Geo. Stewart of\r\nBaltimore; Edward was owned by Chas. Moondo, and Chas. Lee by the above\r\nStewart.\r\n\r\nThose who would have taken this party for stupid, or for know-nothings,\r\nwould have found themselves very much mistaken. Indeed they were far\r\nfrom being dull or sleepy on the subject of Slavery at any rate. They\r\nhad considered pretty thoroughly how wrongfully they, with all others in\r\nsimilar circumstances, had been year in and year out subjected to\r\nunrequited toil so resolved to leave masters and mistresses to shift for\r\nthemselves, while they would try their fortunes in Canada.\r\n\r\nFour of the party ranged in age from twenty to twenty-eight years of\r\nage, and the other two from thirty-seven to forty. The Committee on whom\r\nthey called, rendered them due aid and advice, and forwarded them to the\r\nCommittee in New York.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from Jefferson, appealing for assistance on behalf\r\nof his children in Slavery, was peculiarly touching, as were all similar\r\nletters. But the mournful thought that these appeals, sighs, tears and\r\nprayers would continue in most cases to be made till death, that nothing\r\ncould be done directly for the deliverance of such sufferers was often\r\nas painful as the escape from the auction block was gratifying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM JEFFERSON PIPKINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sept. 28, 1856.\r\n\r\n    To WM. STILL. SIR:--I take the liberty of writing to you a few\r\n    lines concerning my children, for I am very anxious to get them\r\n    and I wish you to please try what you can do for me. Their names\r\n    are Charles and Patrick and are living with Mrs. Joseph G. Wray\r\n    Murphysborough Hartford county, North Carolina; Emma lives with\r\n    a Lawyer Baker in Gatesville North Carolina and Susan lives in\r\n    Portsmouth Virginia and is stopping with Dr. Collins sister a\r\n    Mrs. Nash you can find her out by enquiring for Dr. Collins at\r\n    the ferry boat at Portsmouth, and Rose a coloured woman at the\r\n    Crawford House can tell where she is. And I trust you will try\r\n    what you think will be the best way. And you will do me a great\r\n    favour.\r\n\r\n    Yours Respectfully,\r\n\r\n    JEFFERSON PIPKINS.\r\n\r\n    P.S. I am living at Yorkville near Toronto Canada West. My wife\r\n    sends her best respects to Mrs. Still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVERAL ARRIVALS FROM DIFFERENT PLACES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to economize time and space, with a view to giving an account\r\nof as many of the travelers as possible, it seems expedient, where a\r\nnumber of arrivals come in close proximity to each other, to report them\r\nbriefly, under one head.\r\n\r\nHenry Anderson, _alias_ WILLIAM ANDERSON. In outward appearance Henry\r\nwas uninteresting. As he asserted, and as his appearance indicated, he\r\nhad experienced a large share of \"rugged\" usage. Being far in the South,\r\nand in the hands of a brutal \"Captain of a small boat,\" chances of\r\nfreedom or of moderate treatment, had rarely ever presented themselves\r\nin any aspect. On the 3d of the preceding March he was sold to a negro\r\ntrader--the thought of having to live under a trader was so terrible, he\r\nwas moved to escape, leaving his wife, to whom he had only been married\r\nthree months. Henry was twenty-five years of age, quite black and a\r\nlittle below the medium size.\r\n\r\nHe fled from Beaufort, North Carolina. The system of slavery in all the\r\nregion of country whence Henry came, exhibited generally great brutality\r\nand cruelty.\r\n\r\nCHARLES CONGO AND WIFE, MARGARET. Charles and his wife were fortunate in\r\nmanaging to flee together. Their attachment to each other was evidently\r\ntrue. They were both owned by a farmer, who went by the name of David\r\nStewart, and resided in Maryland. As Charles' owner did not require\r\ntheir services at home, as he had more of that kind of stock than he had\r\nuse for--he hired them out to another farmer--Charles for $105 per\r\nannum; how much for the wife they could not tell. She, however, was not\r\nblessed with good health, though she was not favored any more on that\r\naccount. Charles' affection for his wife, on seeing how hard she had to\r\nlabor when not well, aroused him to seek their freedom by flight. He\r\nresolved to spare no pains, to give himself no rest until they were both\r\nfree. Accordingly the Underground Rail Road was sought and found.\r\nCharles was twenty-eight, with a good head and striking face, as well as\r\notherwise well made; chestnut color and intelligent, though unable to\r\nread. Left two sisters in bondage. Margaret was about the same age as\r\nher husband, a nice-looking brown-skinned woman; worth $500. Charles was\r\nvalued at $1200.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere throughout the neighborhood where Charles and Margaret\r\nhad lived and breathed, and had their existence, was heavily oppressed\r\nwith slavery. No education for the freeman of color, much less for the\r\nslave. The order of the day was literally, as far as colored men were\r\nconcerned: \"No rights which white men were bound to respect.\"\r\n\r\nChaskey Brown, Wm. Henry Washington, James Alfred Frisley, and Charles\r\nHenry Salter. Chaskey is about twenty-four years of age, quite black,\r\nmedium size, sound body and intelligent appearance, nevertheless he\r\nresembled a \"farm hand\" in every particular. His master was known by the\r\nname of Major James H. Gales, and he was the owner of a farm with\r\neighteen men, women and children, slaves to toil for him. The Major in\r\ndisposition was very abusive and profane, though old and grey-headed.\r\nHis wife was pretty much the same kind of a woman as he was a man; one\r\nwho delighted in making the slaves tremble at her bidding. Chaskey was a\r\nmember of the \"Still Pond church,\" of Kent county, Md. Often Chaskey was\r\nmade to feel the lash on his back, notwithstanding his good standing in\r\nthe church. He had a wife and one child. In escaping, he was obliged to\r\nleave them both. Chaskey was valued at $1200.\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry was about 20 years of age, and belonged to Doctor B.\r\nGrain, of Baltimore, who hired him out to a farmer. Not relishing the\r\nidea of having to work all his life in bondage, destitute of all\r\nprivileges, he resolved to seek a refuge in Canada. He left his mother,\r\nfour sisters and two brothers.\r\n\r\nJames is twenty-four years of age, well made, quite black and pretty\r\nshrewd. He too was unable to see how it was that he should be worked,\r\nand flogged, and sold, at the pleasure of his master and \"getting\r\nnothing;\" he \"had rather work for himself.\" His master was a\r\n\"_speckled-faced--pretty large stomach man_, but was not very abuseful.\"\r\nHe only owned one other.\r\n\r\nCharles Henry is about thirty years of age, of good proportion,\r\nnice-looking and intelligent; but to rough usage he was no stranger. To\r\nselect his own master was a privilege not allowed; privileges of all\r\nkinds were rare with him. So he resolved to flee. Left his mother, three\r\nsisters and five brothers in slavery. He was a member of \"Albany\r\nChapel,\" at Massey's Cross Roads, and a slave of Dr. B. Crain. Charles\r\nleft his wife Anna, living near the head of Sassafras, Md. The\r\nseparation was painful, as was everything belonging to the system of\r\nSlavery.\r\n\r\nThese were all gladly received by the Vigilance Committee, and the hand\r\nof friendship warmly extended to them; and the best of counsel and\r\nencouragement was offered; material aid, food and clothing were also\r\nfurnished as they had need, and they were sent on their way rejoicing to\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nStephen Taylor, Charles Brown, Charles Henry Hollis, and Luther Dorsey.\r\nStephen was a fine young man, of twenty years of age; he fled to keep\r\nfrom being sold. He \"supposed his master wanted money.\" His master was a\r\n\"tall, spare-faced man, with long whiskers, very wicked and very\r\nquick-tempered,\" and was known by the name of James Smithen, of Sandy\r\nHook, Harford county, Md. His wife was also a very \"close woman.\" They\r\nhad four children growing up to occupy their places as oppressors.\r\nStephen was not satisfied to serve either old or young masters any\r\nlonger, and made up his mind to leave the first opportunity. Before this\r\nwatchful and resolute purpose the way opened, and he soon found it\r\ncomparatively easy to find his way from Maryland to Pennsylvania, and\r\nlikewise into the hands of the Vigilance Committee, to whom he made\r\nknown fully the character of the place and people whence he had fled,\r\nthe dangers he was exposed to from slave-hunters, and the strong hope he\r\ncherished of reaching free land soon. Being a young man of promise,\r\nStephen was advised earnestly to apply his mind to seek an education,\r\nand to use every possible endeavor to raise himself in the scale of\r\nmanhood, morally, religiously and intellectually; and he seemed to drink\r\nin the admonitions thus given with a relish. After recruiting, and all\r\nnecessary arrangements had been made for his comfort and passage to\r\nCanada, he was duly forwarded. \"One more slave-holder is minus another\r\nslave worth at least $1200, which is something to rejoice over,\" said\r\nCommittee. Stephen's parents were dead; one brother was the only near\r\nrelative he left in chains.\r\n\r\nCharles Brown was about twenty-five years of age, quite black, and bore\r\nthe marks of having been used hard, though his stout and hearty\r\nappearance would have rendered him very desirable to a trader. He fled\r\nfrom William Wheeling, of Sandy Hook, Md. He spoke of his master as a\r\n\"pretty bad man,\" who was \"always quarreling,\" and \"would drink, swear\r\nand lie.\" Left simply because he \"never got anything for his labor.\" On\r\ntaking his departure for Canada, he was called upon to bid adieu to his\r\nmother and three brothers, all under the yoke. His master he describes\r\nthus--\r\n\r\n\"His face was long, cheek-bones high, middling tall, and about\r\ntwenty-six years of age.\" With this specimen of humanity, Charles was\r\nvery much dissatisfied, and he made up his mind not to stand the burdens\r\nof Slavery a day longer than he could safely make his way to the North.\r\nAnd in making an effort to reach Canada, he was quite willing to suffer\r\nmany things. So the first chance Charles got, he started, and Providence\r\nsmiled upon his resolution; he found himself a joyful passenger on the\r\nUnderground Rail Road, being entertained free, and receiving attentions\r\nfrom the Company all along the line through to her British Majesty's\r\nboundlessly free territory in the Canadas.\r\n\r\nTrue, the thought of his mother and brothers, left in the prison house,\r\nlargely marred his joy, as it did also the Committee's, still the\r\nCommittee felt that Charles had gained his Freedom honorably, and at the\r\nsame time, had left his master a poorer, if not a wiser man, by at least\r\n$1200.\r\n\r\nCharles Henry was a good-looking young man, only twenty years of age,\r\nand appeared to possess double as much natural sense as he would require\r\nto take care of himself. John Webster of Sandy Hook, claimed Charles'\r\ntime, body and mind, and this was what made Charles unhappy. Uneducated\r\nas he was, he was too sensible to believe that Webster had any God-given\r\nright to his manhood. Consequently, he left because his master \"did not\r\ntreat him right.\"  Webster was a tall man, with large black whiskers,\r\nabout forty years of age, and owned Charles' two sisters. Charles was\r\nsorry for the fate of his sisters, but he could not help them if he\r\nremained. Staying to wear the yoke, he felt would rather make it worse\r\ninstead of better for all concerned.\r\n\r\nLuther Dorsey is about nineteen years of age, rather smart, black, well\r\nmade and well calculated for a Canadian. He was prompted to escape\r\npurely from the desire to be \"_free_.\" He fled from a \"very insulting\r\nman,\" by the name of Edward Schriner, from the neighborhood of\r\nSairsville Mills, Frederick Co., Md. This Schriner was described as a\r\n\"low chunky man, with grum look, big mouth, etc.,\" and was a member of\r\nthe German Reformed Church. \"Don't swear, though might as well; he was\r\nso bad other ways.\"\r\n\r\nLuther was a member of the Methodist church at Jones Hill. Left his\r\nfather in chains; his mother had wisely escaped to Canada years back,\r\nwhen he was but a boy. Where she was then, he could not tell, but hoped\r\nto meet her in Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM RICHMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nJEREMIAH W. SMITH AND WIFE JULIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nRichmond was a city noted for its activity and enterprise in slave\r\ntrade. Several slave pens and prisons were constantly kept up to\r\naccommodate the trade. And slave auctions were as common in Richmond as\r\ndress goods auctions in Philadelphia; notwithstanding this fact, strange\r\nas it may seem, the Underground Rail Road brought away large numbers of\r\npassengers from Richmond, Petersburg and Norfolk, and not a few of them\r\nlived comparatively within a hair's breadth of the auction block. Many\r\nof those from these localities were amongst the most intelligent and\r\nrespectable slaves in the South, and except at times when disheartened\r\nby some grave disaster which had befallen the road, as, for instance,\r\nwhen some friendly captain or conductor was discovered in aiding\r\nfugitives, many of the thinking bondmen were daily manoeuvering and\r\nwatching for opportunities to escape or aid their friends so to do. This\r\nstate of things of course made the naturally hot blood of Virginians\r\nfairly boil. They had preached long and loudly about the contented and\r\nhappy condition of the slaves,--that the chief end of the black man was\r\nto worship and serve the white man, with joy and delight, with more\r\nwillingness and obedience indeed than he would be expected to serve his\r\nMaker. So the slave-holders were utterly at a loss to account for the\r\nunnatural desire on the part of the slaves to escape to the North where\r\nthey affirmed they would be far less happy in freedom than in the hands\r\nof those so \"kind and indulgent towards them.\" Despite all this, daily\r\nthe disposition increased, with the more intelligent slaves, to distrust\r\nthe statements of their masters especially when they spoke against the\r\nNorth. For instance if the master was heard to curse Boston the slave\r\nwas then satisfied that Boston was just the place he would like to go\r\nto; or if the master told the slave that the blacks in Canada were\r\nfreezing and starving to death by hundreds, his hope of trying to reach\r\nCanada was made tenfold stronger; he was willing to risk all the\r\nstarving and freezing that the country could afford; his eagerness to\r\nfind a conductor then would become almost painful.\r\n\r\nThe situations of Jeremiah and Julia Smith, however, were not considered\r\nvery hard, indeed they had fared rather better than most slaves in\r\nVirginia, nevertheless it will be seen that they desired to better their\r\ncondition, to keep off of the auction-block at least. Jeremiah could\r\nclaim to have no mixture in his blood, as his color was of such a pure\r\nblack; but with the way of the world, in respect to shrewdness and\r\nintelligence, he had evidently been actively conversant. He was about\r\ntwenty-six years of age, and in stature only medium, with poor health.\r\n\r\nThe name of James Kinnard, whom he was obliged to call master and serve,\r\nwas disgusting to him. Kinnard, he said, was a \"close and severe man.\"\r\nAt the same time he was not considered by the community \"a hard man.\"\r\nFrom the age of fifteen years Jeremiah had been hired out, for which his\r\nowner had received from $50 to $130 per annum. In consequence of his\r\nmaster's custom of thus letting out Jeremiah, the master had avoided\r\ndoctors' bills, &c. For the last two years prior to his escape, however,\r\nJeremiah's health had been very treacherous, in consequence of which the\r\nmaster had been compelled to receive only $50 a year, sick or well.\r\nAbout one month before Jeremiah left, he was to have been taken on his\r\nmaster's farm, with the hope that he could be made more profitable there\r\nthan he was in being hired out.\r\n\r\nHis owner had thought once of selling him, perhaps fearing that Jeremiah\r\nmight unluckily die on his hands. So he put him in prison and\r\nadvertised; but as he had the asthma pretty badly at that time, he was\r\nnot saleable, the traders even declined to buy him.\r\n\r\nWhile these troubles were presenting themselves to Jeremiah, Julia, his\r\nwife, was still more seriously involved, which added to Jeremiah's\r\nperplexities, of course.\r\n\r\nJulia was of a dark brown color, of medium size, and thirty years of\r\nage. Fourteen years she had been the slave of A. Judson Crane, and under\r\nhim she had performed the duties of nurse, chamber-maid, etc.,\r\n\"faithfully and satisfactorily,\" as the certificate furnished her by\r\nthis owner witnessed. She actually possessing a certificate, which he,\r\nCrane, gave her to enable her to find a new master, as she was then\r\nabout to be sold. Her master had experienced a failure in business. This\r\nwas the reason why she was to be sold.\r\n\r\nMrs. Crane, her mistress, had always promised Julia that she should be\r\nfree at her death. But, unexpectedly, as Mrs. Crane was on her journey\r\nhome from Cape May, where she had been for her health the summer before\r\nJulia escaped, she died suddenly in Philadelphia. Julia, however, had\r\nbeen sold twice before her mistress' death; once to the trader, Reed,\r\nand afterwards to John Freeland, and again was on the eve of being sold.\r\nFreeland, her last owner, thought she was unhappy because she was denied\r\nthe privilege of going home of nights to her husband, instead of being\r\non hand at the beck and call of her master and mistress day and night.\r\nSo the very day Julia and her husband escaped, arrangements had been\r\nmade to put her up at auction a third time. But both Julia and her\r\nhusband had seen enough of Slavery to leave no room to hope that they\r\ncould ever find peace or rest so long as they remained. So there and\r\nthen, they resolved to strike for Canada, via the Underground Rail Road.\r\nBy a little good management, berths were procured for them on one of the\r\nRichmond steamers (berths not known to the officers of the boat), and\r\nthey were safely landed in the hands of the Vigilance Committee, and a\r\nmost agreeable interview was had.\r\n\r\nThe Committee extended to them the usual hospitalities, in the way of\r\nboard, accommodations, and free tickets Canadaward, and wished them a\r\nsafe and speedy passage. The passengers departed, exceedingly\r\nlight-hearted, Feb. 1, 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEIGHT ARRIVALS:\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES MASSEY, PERRY HENRY TRUSTY, GEORGE RHOADS, JAMES RHOADS, GEORGE\r\nWASHINGTON, SARAH ELIZABETH RHOADS AND CHILD, MARY ELIZABETH STEVENSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoubtless there was a sensation in \"the camp,\" when this gang was found\r\nmissing.\r\n\r\nJames was a likely-looking young man of twenty years of age, dark, tall,\r\nand sensible; and worth, if we may judge, about $1,600. He was owned by\r\na farmer named James Pittman, a \"crabid kind of a man,\" grey-headed,\r\nwith a broken leg; drank very hard, at which times he would swear that\r\nhe would \"sell them all to Georgia;\" this threat was always unpleasant\r\nto the ears of James, but it seemed to be a satisfaction to the master.\r\nFearing that it would be put into execution, James thought he had better\r\nlet no time be lost in getting on towards Canada, though he was entitled\r\nto his Freedom at the age of twenty-five. Left his father, four brothers\r\nand two sisters. Also left his wife, to whom he had been married the\r\nprevious Christmas.\r\n\r\nHis master's further stock of slaves consisted of two women, a young man\r\nand a child. The name of his old mistress was Amelia. She was \"right\r\nnice,\" James admitted. One of James' brothers had been sold to Georgia\r\nby Pittman, although he was also entitled to his Freedom at the age of\r\ntwenty-five.\r\n\r\nHis near relatives left in bondage lived near Level Square, Queen Ann's\r\ncounty, Maryland. His wife's name was Henrietta. \"She was free.\"\r\n\r\nInteresting letter from James Massey to his wife. It was forwarded to\r\nthe corresponding secretary, to be sent to her, but no opportunity was\r\nafforded so to do, safely.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ST. CATHARINES, C.W., April 24, 1857.\r\n\r\n    Dear  Wife--I take this opertunity to inform you that I have\r\n    Arive in St Catharines this Eving.

He was not free,\r\nhowever, from the sad thought of having left his wife and three children\r\nin the \"_prison house_,\" nor of the fact that his own dear mother was\r\nbrutally stabbed to the heart with a butcher knife by her young master,\r\nwhile he (Perry) was a babe; nor of a more recent tragedy by which a\r\nfellow-servant, only a short while before he fled, was also murdered by\r\na stab in the groin from another young master. \"Powerful bad\" treatment,\r\nand \"no pay,\" was the only reward poor Perry had ever received for his\r\nlife services. Perry could only remember his having received from his\r\nmaster, in all, eleven cents. Left a brother and sister in Slavery.\r\nPerry was worth $1200 perhaps.\r\n\r\nPerry was compelled to leave his wife and three children--namely, Hannah\r\n(wife), Perry Henry, William Thomas and Alexander, who were owned by\r\nJohn McGuire, of Caroline county, Maryland. Perry was a fellow-servant\r\nof James Massey, and was held by the same owner who held James. It is\r\nbut just, to say, that it was not in the Pittman family that his mother\r\nand his fellow-servant had been so barbarously murdered. These\r\noccurrences took place before they came into the hands of Pittman.\r\n\r\nThe provocation for which his fellow-servant was killed, was said to be\r\nvery trifling. In a moment of rage, his young master, John Piper,\r\nplunged the blade of a small knife into Perry's groin, which resulted in\r\nhis death twenty-six hours afterwards. For one day only the young master\r\nkept himself concealed, then he came forward and said he \"did it in\r\nself-defense,\" and there the matter ended. The half will never be told\r\nof the barbarism of Slavery.\r\n\r\nPerry's letter subjoined, explains where he went, and how his mind was\r\noccupied with thoughts of his wife, children and friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ST.

He had come from under\r\nthe control of John P. Dellum a farmer, and a crabbed master, who \"would\r\nswear very much when crossed, and would drink moderately every day,\"\r\nexcept sometimes he would \"take a _spree_,\" and would then get pretty\r\nhigh. Withal he was a member of the Presbyterian church at Perryville,\r\nMaryland; he was a single man and followed farming. Within the last two\r\nor three years, he had sold a man and woman; hence, George thought it\r\nwas time to take warning. Accordingly he felt it to be his duty to try\r\nfor Canada, via Underground Rail Road. As his master had always declared\r\nthat if one run off, he would sell the rest to Georgia, George very\r\nwisely concluded that as an effort would have to be made, they had\r\nbetter leave their master with as \"few as possible to be troubled with\r\nselling.\" Consequently, a consultation was had between the brothers,\r\nwhich resulted in the exit of a party of eight. The market price for\r\nGeorge would be about $1400. A horrid example professed Christians set\r\nbefore the world, while holding slaves and upholding Slavery.\r\n\r\nJames Rhoads, brother of George, was twenty-three years of age, medium\r\nsize, dark color, intelligent and manly, and would doubtless have\r\nbrought, in the Richmond market, $1700. Fortunately he brought his wife\r\nand child with him. James was also held by the same task-master who held\r\nGeorge. Often had he been visited with severe stripes, and had borne his\r\nfull share of suffering from his master.\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington, one of the same party, was only about fifteen years\r\nof age; he was tall enough, however, to pass for a young man of twenty.\r\nGeorge was of an excellent, fast, dark color. Of course, mentally he was\r\nundeveloped, nevertheless, possessed of enough mother-wit to make good\r\nhis escape. In the slave market he might have been valued at $800.\r\nGeorge was claimed as the lawful property of Benjamin Sylves--a\r\nPresbyterian, who owned besides, two men, three girls, and a boy. He was\r\n\"tolerable good\" sometimes, and sometimes \"bad.\" Some of the slaves\r\nsupposed themselves to be on the eve of being emancipated about the time\r\nGeorge left; but of this there was no certainty. George, however, was\r\nnot among this hopeful number, consequently, he thought that he would\r\nstart in time, and would be ready to shout for Freedom quite as soon as\r\nany other of his fellow-bondmen. George left a father and three sisters.\r\nSarah Elizabeth Rhoads, wife of James Rhoads, was seventeen years of\r\nage, a tall, dark, young woman, who had had no chances for mental\r\nimprovement, except such as were usual on a farm, stocked with slaves,\r\nwhere learning to read the Bible was against the \"rules.\" Sarah was a\r\nyoung slave mother with a babe (of course a slave) only eight months\r\nold. She was regarded as having been exceedingly fortunate in having\r\nrescued herself and child from the horrid fate of slaves.\r\n\r\nMARY ELIZABETH STEPHENSON is a promising-looking young woman, of twenty\r\nyears of age, chestnut color, and well made. Hard treatment had been her\r\nlot. Left her mother, two sisters and four brothers in bondage. Worth\r\n$1100.\r\n\r\nAlthough these travelers were of the \"field hand\" class, who had never\r\nbeen permitted to see much off of the farm, and had been deprived of\r\nhearing intelligent people talk, yet the spirit of Freedom, so natural\r\nto man, was quite uppermost with all of them. The members of the\r\nCommittee who saw them, were abundantly satisfied that these candidates\r\nfor Canada would prove that they were able to \"take care of themselves.\"\r\n\r\nTheir wants were attended to in the usual manner, and they were sent on\r\ntheir way rejoicing, the Committee feeling quite a deep interest in\r\nthem. It looked like business to see so many passing over the Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES THOMPSON,\r\n\r\n\r\nCARRIER OF \"THE NATIONAL AMERICAN,\" OFF FOR CANADA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subjoined \"pass\" was brought to the Underground Rail Road station in\r\nPhiladelphia by Charles, and while it was interesting as throwing light\r\nupon his escape, it is important also as a specimen of the way the\r\n\"pass\" system was carried on in the dark days of Slavery in Virginia:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"NAT. AMERICAN OFFICE,\r\n\r\n    Richmond, July 20th, 1857.\r\n\r\n    Permit Charles to pass and repass from this office to the\r\n    residence of Rev B. Manly's on Clay St., near 11th, at any hour\r\n    of the night for one month.\r\n\r\n    WM. W. HARDWICK.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a very short document, but it used to be very unsafe for a slave\r\nin Richmond, or any other Southern city, to be found out in the evening\r\nwithout a legal paper of this description. The penalties for being found\r\nunprepared to face the police were fines, imprisonment and floggings.\r\nThe satisfaction it seemed always to afford these guardians of the city\r\nto find either males or females trespassing in this particular, was\r\nunmistakable. It gave them (the police) the opportunity to prove to\r\nthose they served (slaveholders), that they were the right men in the\r\nright place, guarding their interests. Then again they got the fine for\r\npocket money, and likewise the still greater pleasure of administering\r\nthe flogging. Who would want an office, if no opportunity should turn up\r\nwhereby proof could be adduced of adequate qualifications to meet\r\nemergencies? But Charles was too wide awake to be caught without his\r\npass day or night. Consequently he hung on to it, even after starting on\r\nhis voyage to Canada. He, however, willingly surrendered it to a member\r\nof the Committee at his special request.\r\n\r\nBut in every way Charles was quite a remarkable man. It afforded the\r\nCommittee great pleasure to make his acquaintance, and much practical\r\nand useful information was gathered from his story, which was felt to be\r\ntruthful.\r\n\r\nThe Committee feeling assured that this \"chattel\" must have been the\r\nsubject of much inquiry and anxiety from the nature of his former\r\nposition, as a prominent piece of property, as a member of the Baptist\r\nchurch, as taking \"first premiums\" in making tobacco, and as a paper\r\ncarrier in the National American office, felt called upon to note fully\r\nhis movements before and after leaving Richmond.\r\n\r\nIn stature he was medium size, color quite dark, hair long and\r\nbushy--rather of a raw-boned and rugged appearance, modest and\r\nself-possessed; with much more intelligence than would be supposed from\r\nfirst observation. On his arrival, ere he had \"shaken hands with the\r\n(British) Lion's paw,\" (which he was desirous of doing), or changed the\r\nhabiliments in which he escaped, having listened to the recital of his\r\nthrilling tale, and wishing to get it word for word as it flowed\r\nnaturally from his brave lips, at a late hour of the night a member of\r\nthe Committee remarked to him, with pencil in hand, that he wanted to\r\ntake down some account of his life. \"Now,\" said he, \"we shall have to be\r\nbrief. Please answer as correctly as you can the following questions:\"\r\n\"How old are you?\" \"Thirty-two years old the 1st day of last June.\"\r\n\"Were you born a slave?\" \"Yes.\" \"How have you been treated?\" \"Badly all\r\nthe time for the last twelve years.\" \"What do you mean by being treated\r\nbadly?\" \"Have been whipped, and they never give me anything; some people\r\ngive their servants at Christmas a dollar and a half and two dollars,\r\nand some five, but my master would never give me anything.\" \"What was\r\nthe name of your master?\" \"Fleming Bibbs.\" \"Where did he live?\" \"In\r\nCaroline county, fifty miles above Richmond.\" \"What did he do?\" \"He was\r\na farmer.\" \"Did you ever live with him?\" \"Never did; always hired me\r\nout, and then I couldn't please him.\" \"What kind of a man was he?\" \"A\r\nman with a very severe temper; would drink at all times, though would do\r\nit slyly.\" \"Was he a member of any church?\" \"Baptist church--would curse\r\nat his servants as if he wern't in any church.\" \"Were his family members\r\nof church, too?\" \"Yes.\" \"What kind of family had he?\" \"His wife was a\r\ntolerable fair woman, but his sons were dissipated, all of them\r\n_rowdies_ and _gamblers. His sons has had children by the servants. One\r\nof his daughters had a child by his grandson last April_. They are\r\ntraders, buy and sell.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many slaves did he own?\" \"Sam, Richmond, Henry, Dennis, Jesse,\r\nAddison, Hilliard, Jenny, Lucius, Julia, Charlotte, Easte, Joe, Taylor,\r\nLouisa, two more small children and Jim.\" Did any of them know that you\r\nwere going to leave? \"No, I saw my brother Tuesday, but never told him a\r\nword about it.\" \"What put it into your head to leave?\" \"It was bad\r\ntreatment; for being put in jail for sale the 7th of last January; was\r\nwhipped in jail and after I came out the only thing they told me was\r\nthat I had been selling newspapers about the streets, and was half\r\nfree.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did you live then?\" \"In Richmond, Va.; for twenty-two years I\r\nhave been living out.\" \"How much did your master receive a year for your\r\nhire?\" \"From sixty-five to one hundred and fifty dollars.\" \"Did you have\r\nto find yourself?\" \"The people who hired me found me. The general rule\r\nis in Richmond, for a week's board, seventy-five cents is allowed; if he\r\ngets any more than that he has got to find it himself.\" \"How about\r\nSunday clothing?\" \"Find them yourself?\" \"How about a house to live in?\"\r\n\"Have that to find yourself.\" \"Suppose you have a wife and family.\" \"It\r\nmakes no difference, they don't allow you anything for that at all.\"\r\n\"Suppose you are sick who pays your doctor's bill?\" \"He (master) pays\r\nthat.\" \"How do you manage to make a little extra money?\" \"By getting up\r\nbefore day and carrying out papers and doing other jobs, cleaning up\r\nsingle men's rooms and the like of that.\" \"What have you been employed\r\nat in Richmond?\" \"Been working in tobacco factory in general; this year\r\nI was hired at a printing-office. The National American. I carried\r\npapers.\" \"Had you a wife?\" \"I did, but her master was a very bad man and\r\nwas opposed to me, and was against my coming to his place to see my\r\nwife, and he persuaded her to take another husband in preference to me;\r\nbeing in his hands she took his advice.\" \"How long ago was that?\" \"Very\r\nnear twelve months; she got married last fall.\" \"Had you any children?\"\r\n\"Yes.\" \"How many?\" \"Five.\" \"Where are they?\" \"Three are with Joel Luck,\r\nher master, one with his sister Eliza, and the other belongs to Judge\r\nHudgins, of Bowling Green Court House.\" \"Do you ever expect to see them\r\nagain?\" \"No, not till the day of the Great I am!\" \"Did you ever have any\r\nchance of schooling?\" \"Not a day in my life.\" \"Can you read?\" \"No, sir,\r\nnor write my own name.\" \"What do you think of Slavery any how?\" \"I think\r\nit's a great curse, and I think the _Baptists_ in _Richmond_ will go to\r\nthe deepest hell, if there is any, for they are so wicked they will work\r\nyou all day and part of the night, and _wear cloaks and long faces_, and\r\ntry to get all the work out of you they can by telling you about Jesus\r\nChrist. All the extra money you make they think you will give to hear\r\ntalk about Jesus Christ. Out of their extra money they have to pay a\r\nwhite man _Five hundred dollars a year for preaching_.\" \"What kind of\r\npreaching does he give them?\" \"He tells them if they die in their sins\r\nthey will go to hell; don't tell them any thing about their elevation;\r\nhe would tell them obey their masters and mistresses, for good servants\r\nmake good masters.\" \"Did you belong to the Baptist Church?\" \"Yes, Second\r\nBaptist Church.\" \"Did you feel that the preaching you heard was the true\r\nGospel?\" \"One part of it, and one part burnt me as bad as ever insult\r\ndid. They would tell us that we must take money out of our pockets to\r\nsend it to Africa, to enlighten the African race. I think that we were\r\nabout as blind in Richmond as the African race is in Africa. All they\r\nwant you to know, is to have sense enough to say master and mistress,\r\nand _run_ like lightning, when they speak to you, to do exactly what\r\nthey want you to do,\" \"When you made up your mind to escape, where did\r\nyou think you would go to?\" \"I made up my mind not to stop short of the\r\nBritish protection; to shake hands with the _Lion's_ paw.\" \"Were you not\r\nafraid of being captured on the way, of being devoured by the\r\nabolitionists, or of freezing and starving in Canada?\" \"Well, I had\r\noften thought that I would be in a bad condition to come here, without\r\nmoney and clothes, but I made up my mind to come, live or die.\" \"What\r\nare your impressions from what little you have seen of Freedom?\" \"I\r\nthink it is intended for all men, and all men ought to have it.\"\r\n\"Suppose your master was to appear before you, and offer you the\r\nprivilege of returning to Slavery or death on the spot, which would be\r\nyour choice?\" \"_Die right there_. I made up my mind before I started.\"\r\n\"Do you think that many of the slaves are anxious about their Freedom?\"\r\n\"The third part of them ain't anxious about it, because the white people\r\nhave _blinded_ them, telling about the North,--they _can't live here_;\r\ntelling them that the people are worse off than they are there; they say\r\nthat the 'niggers' in the North have no houses to live in, stand about\r\nfreezing, dirty, no clothes to wear. They all would be very glad to get\r\ntheir time, but want to stay where they are.\" Just at this point of the\r\ninterview, the hour of midnight admonished us that it was time to\r\nretire. Accordingly, said Mr. Thompson, \"I guess we had better close,\"\r\nadding, if he \"could only write, he could give seven volumes!\" Also,\r\nsaid he, \"give my best respects to Mr. W.W. Hardwicke, and Mr. Perry in\r\nthe National American office, and tell them _I wish they will pay the\r\ntwo boys who carry the papers for me, for they are as ignorant of this\r\nmatter as you are_.\"\r\n\r\nCharles was duly forwarded to Canada to shake hands with the Lion's paw,\r\nand from the accounts which came from him to the Committee, he was\r\nhighly delighted. The following letter from him afforded gratifying\r\nevidence, that he neither forgot his God nor his friends in freedom:\r\n\r\n\r\n    DETROIT, Sept. 17, 1862.\r\n\r\n    DEAR BROTHER IN CHRIST--It affords me the greatest pleasure\r\n    imaginable in the time I shall occupy in penning these few lines\r\n    to you and your dear loving wife, not because I can write them\r\n    to you myself, but for the love and regard I have for you, for I\r\n    never can forget a man who will show kindness to his neighbor\r\n    when in distress. I remember when I was in distress and out of\r\n    doors, you took me in; I was hungry, and you fed me; for these\r\n    things God will reward you, dear brother. I am getting along as\r\n    well as I can expect. Since I have been out here, I have\r\n    endeavored to make every day tell for itself, and I can say, no\r\n    doubt, what a great many men cannot say, that I have made good\r\n    use of all the time that God has given me, and not one week has\r\n    been spent in idleness. Brother William, I expect to visit you\r\n    some time next summer to sit and have a talk with you and Mrs.\r\n    Still. I hope to see that time, if it is God's will. You will\r\n    remember me, with my wife, to Mrs. Still. Give my best respects\r\n    to all inquiring friends, and believe me to be yours forever.\r\n    Well wishes both soul and body. Please write to me sometimes.\r\n\r\n    C.W. THOMPSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOOD FLOWED FREELY.\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAM GALLOWAY AND RICHARD EDEN, TWO PASSENGERS SECRETED IN A VESSEL\r\nLOADED WITH SPIRITS OF TURPENTINE. SHROUDS PREPARED TO PREVENT BEING\r\nSMOKED TO DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Philadelphia branch of the Underground Rail Road was not fortunate\r\nin having very frequent arrivals from North Carolina. Of course such of\r\nher slave population as managed to become initiated in the mysteries of\r\ntraveling North by the Underground Rail Road were sensible enough to\r\nfind out nearer and safer routes than through Pennsylvania. Nevertheless\r\nthe Vigilance Committee of Philadelphia occasionally had the pleasure of\r\nreceiving some heroes who were worthy to be classed among the bravest of\r\nthe brave, no matter who they may be who have claims to this\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\nIn proof of this bold assertion the two individuals whose names stand at\r\nthe beginning of this chapter are presented. Abram was only twenty-one\r\nyears of age, mulatto, five feet six inches high, intelligent and the\r\npicture of good health. \"What was your master's name?\" inquired a member\r\nof the Committee. \"Milton Hawkins,\" answered Abram. \"What business did\r\nMilton Hawkins follow?\" again queried said member. \"He was chief\r\nengineer on the Wilmington and Manchester Rail Road\" (not a branch of\r\nthe Underground Rail Road), responded Richard. \"Describe him,\" said the\r\nmember. \"He was a slim built, tall man with whiskers. He was a man of\r\nvery good disposition. I always belonged to him; he owned three. He\r\nalways said he would sell before he would use a whip. His wife was a\r\nvery mean woman; she would whip contrary to his orders.\" \"Who was your\r\nfather?\" was further inquired. \"John Wesley Galloway,\" was the prompt\r\nresponse. \"Describe your father?\" \"He was captain of a government\r\nvessel; he recognized me as his son, and protected me as far as he was\r\nallowed so to do; he lived at Smithfield, North Carolina. Abram's\r\nmaster, Milton Hawkins, lived at Wilmington, N.C.\" \"What prompted you to\r\nescape?\" was next asked. \"Because times were hard and I could not come\r\nup with my wages as I was required to do, so I thought I would try and\r\ndo better.\" At this juncture Abram explained substantially in what sense\r\ntimes were hard, &c. In the first place he was not allowed to own\r\nhimself; he, however, preferred hiring his time to serving in the usual\r\nway. This favor was granted Abram; but he was compelled to pay $15 per\r\nmonth for his time, besides finding himself in clothing, food, paying\r\ndoctor bills, and a head tax of $15 a year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HON. ABRAM GALLOWAY]\r\n\r\nEven under this master, who was a man of very good disposition, Abram\r\nwas not contented. In the second place, he \"always thought Slavery was\r\nwrong,\" although he had \"never suffered any personal abuse.\" Toiling\r\nmonth after month the year round to support his master and not himself,\r\nwas the one intolerable thought. Abram and Richard were intimate\r\nfriends, and lived near each other. Being similarly situated, they could\r\nventure to communicate the secret feelings of their hearts to each\r\nother. Richard was four years older than Abram, with not quite so much\r\nAnglo-Saxon blood in his veins, but was equally as intelligent, and was\r\nby trade, a \"fashionable barber,\" well-known to the ladies and gentlemen\r\nof Wilmington. Richard owed service to Mrs. Mary Loren, a widow. \"She\r\nwas very kind and tender to all her slaves.\" \"If I was sick,\" said\r\nRichard, \"she would treat me the same as a mother would.\" She was the\r\nowner of twenty, men, women and children, who were all hired out, except\r\nthe children too young for hire. Besides having his food, clothing and\r\ndoctor's expenses to meet, he had to pay the \"very kind and\r\ntender-hearted widow\" $12.50 per month, and head tax to the State,\r\namounting to twenty-five cents per month. It so happened, that Richard\r\nat this time, was involved in a matrimonial difficulty. Contrary to the\r\nlaws of North Carolina, he had lately married a free girl, which was an\r\nindictable offence, and for which the penalty was then in soak for\r\nhim--said penalty to consist of thirty-nine lashes, and imprisonment at\r\nthe discretion of the judge.\r\n\r\nSo Abram and Richard put their heads together, and resolved to try the\r\nUnderground Rail Road. They concluded that liberty was worth dying for,\r\nand that it was their duty to strike for Freedom even if it should cost\r\nthem their lives. The next thing needed, was information about the\r\nUnderground Rail Road. Before a great while the captain of a schooner\r\nturned up, from Wilmington, Delaware. Learning that his voyage extended\r\nto Philadelphia, they sought to find out whether this captain was true\r\nto Freedom. To ascertain this fact required no little address. It had to\r\nbe done in such a way, that even the captain would not really understand\r\nwhat they were up to, should he be found untrue. In this instance,\r\nhowever, he was the right man in the right place, and very well\r\nunderstood his business.\r\n\r\nAbram and Richard made arrangements with him to bring them away; they\r\nlearned when the vessel would start, and that she was loaded with tar,\r\nrosin, and spirits of turpentine, amongst which the captain was to\r\nsecrete them. But here came the difficulty. In order that slaves might\r\nnot be secreted in vessels, the slave-holders of North Carolina had\r\nprocured the enactment of a law requiring all vessels coming North to be\r\nsmoked.\r\n\r\nTo escape this dilemma, the inventive genius of Abram and Richard soon\r\ndevised a safe-guard against the smoke. This safe-guard consisted in\r\nsilk oil cloth shrouds, made large, with drawing strings, which, when\r\npulled over their heads, might be drawn very tightly around their\r\nwaists, whilst the process of smoking might be in operation. A bladder\r\nof water and towels were provided, the latter to be wet and held to\r\ntheir nostrils, should there be need. In this manner they had determined\r\nto struggle against death for liberty. The hour approached for being at\r\nthe wharf. At the appointed time they were on hand ready to go on the\r\nboat; the captain secreted them, according to agreement. They were ready\r\nto run the risk of being smoked to death; but as good luck would have\r\nit, the law was not carried into effect in this instance, so that the\r\n\"smell of smoke was not upon them.\" The effect of the turpentine,\r\nhowever, of the nature of which they were totally ignorant, was worse,\r\nif possible, than the smoke would have been. The blood was literally\r\ndrawn from them at every pore in frightful quantities. But as heroes of\r\nthe bravest type they resolved to continue steadfast as long as a pulse\r\ncontinued to beat, and thus they finally conquered.\r\n\r\nThe invigorating northern air and the kind treatment of the Vigilance\r\nCommittee acted like a charm upon them, and they improved very rapidly\r\nfrom their exhaustive and heavy loss of blood. Desiring to retain some\r\nmemorial of them, a member of the Committee begged one of their silk\r\nshrouds, and likewise procured an artist to take the photograph of one\r\nof them; which keepsakes have been valued very highly. In the regular\r\norder of arrangements the wants of Abram and Richard were duly met by\r\nthe Committee, financially and otherwise, and they were forwarded to\r\nCanada. After their safe arrival in Canada, Richard addressed a member\r\nof the Committee thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    KINGSTON, July 20, 1857.\r\n\r\n    MR. WILLIAM STILL--_Dear Friend_:--I take the opertunity of\r\n    wrighting a few lines to let you no that we air all in good\r\n    health hoping thos few lines may find you and your family\r\n    engoying the same blessing. We arived in King all saft Canada\r\n    West Abram Galway gos to work this morning at $1.75 per day and\r\n    John pediford is at work for mr george mink and i will opne a\r\n    shop for my self in a few days My wif will send a daugretipe to\r\n    your cair whitch you will pleas to send on to me Richard Edons\r\n    to the cair of George Mink Kingston C W\r\n\r\n    Yours with Respect,\r\n\r\n    RICHARD EDONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbram, his comrade, allied himself faithfully to John Bull until Uncle\r\nSam became involved in the contest with the rebels. In this hour of need\r\nAbram hastened back to North Carolina to help fight the battles of\r\nFreedom. How well he acted his part, we are not informed. We only know\r\nthat, after the war was over, in the reconstruction of North Carolina,\r\nAbram was promoted to a seat in its Senate. He died in office only a few\r\nmonths since. The portrait is almost a \"fac-simile.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN PETTIFOOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnglo-African and Anglo-Saxon were about equally mixed in the\r\norganization of Mr. Pettifoot. His education, with regard to books, was\r\nquite limited. He had, however, managed to steal the art of reading and\r\nwriting, to a certain extent. Notwithstanding the Patriarchal\r\nInstitution of the South, he was to all intents and purposes a rebel at\r\nheart, consequently he resolved to take a trip on the Underground Rail\r\nRoad to Canada. So, greatly to the surprise of those whom he was\r\nserving, he was one morning inquired for in vain. No one could tell what\r\nhad become of Jack no more than if he had vanished like a ghost.\r\nDoubtless Messrs. McHenry and McCulloch were under the impression that\r\nnewspapers and money possessed great power and could, under the\r\ncircumstances, be used with entire effect. The following advertisement\r\nis evidence, that Jack was much needed at the tobacco factory.\r\n\r\n\r\n    $100 REWARD--For the apprehension and delivery to us of a\r\n    MULATTO MAN, named John Massenberg, or John Henry Pettifoot, who\r\n    has been passing as free, under the name of Sydney. He is about\r\n    5 feet 6 or 8 inches high, spare made, bright, with a bushy head\r\n    of hair, curled under and a small moustache. Absconded a few\r\n    days ago from our Tobacco Factory.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    McHENRY & MCCULLOCH.\r\n\r\n    ju 16 3t.\r\n\r\n\r\nJack was aware that a trap of this kind would most likely be set for\r\nhim, and that the large quantity of Anglo-Saxon blood in his veins would\r\nnot save him. He was aware, too, that he was the reputed son of a white\r\ngentleman, who was a professional dentist, by the name of Dr. Peter\r\nCards. The Doctor, however, had been called away by death, so Jack could\r\nsee no hope or virtue in having a white father, although a \"chivalric\r\ngentleman,\" while living, and a man of high standing amongst\r\nslave-holders. Jack was a member of the Baptist church, too, and hoped\r\nhe was a good Christian; but he could look for no favors from the\r\nChurch, or sympathy on the score of his being a Christian. He knew very\r\nwell were it known, that he had the love of freedom in his heart, or the\r\nidea of the Underground Rail Road in his head, he would be regarded as\r\nhaving committed the \"unpardonable sin.\" So Jack looked to none of these\r\n\"broken reeds\" in Richmond in the hour of his trial, but to Him above,\r\nwhom he had not seen, and to the Underground Rail Road. He felt pretty\r\nwell satisfied, that if Providence would aid him, and he could get a\r\nconductor to put him on the right road to Canada, he would be all right.\r\nAccordingly, he acted up to his best light, and thus he succeeded\r\nadmirably, as the sequel shows.\r\n\r\nJOHN HENRY PETTIFOOT. John is a likely young man, quite bright in color\r\nand in intellect also. He was the son of Peter Cards, a dentist by\r\nprofession, and a white man by complexion. As a general thing, he had\r\nbeen used 'very well;' had no fault to find, except this year, being\r\nhired to McHenry & McCulloch, tobacconists, of Petersburg, Va., whom he\r\nfound rather more oppressive than he agreed for, and supposing that he\r\nhad 'no right' to work for any body for nothing, he 'picked up his bed\r\nand walked.' His mistress had told him that he was '_willed_ free,' at\r\nher death, but John was not willing to wait her \"motions to die.\"\r\n\r\nHe had a wife in Richmond, but was not allowed to visit her. He left one\r\nsister and a step-father in bondage. Mr. Pettifoot reached Philadelphia\r\nby the Richmond line of steamers, stowed away among the pots and cooking\r\nutensils. On reaching the city, he at once surrendered himself into the\r\nhands of the Committee, and was duly looked after by the regular acting\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMANUEL T. WHITE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMANUEL was about twenty-five years of age, with seven-eighths of white\r\nblood in his veins, medium size, and a very smart and likely-looking\r\npiece of property generally. He had the good fortune to escape from\r\nEdward H. Hubbert, a ship timber merchant of Norfolk, Va. Under\r\nHubbert's yoke he had served only five years, having been bought by him\r\nfrom a certain Aldridge Mandrey, who was described as a \"very cruel\r\nman,\" and would \"rather fight than eat.\" \"I have licks that will carry\r\nme to my grave, and will be there till the flesh rots off my bones,\"\r\nsaid Emanuel, adding that his master was a \"_devil_,\" though a member of\r\nthe Reformed Methodist Church. But his mistress, he said, was a \"right\r\nnice little woman, and kept many licks off me.\" \"If you said you were\r\nsick, he would whip it out of you.\" From Mandrey he once fled, and was\r\ngone two months, but was captured at Williamsburg, Va., and received a\r\nsevere flogging, and carried home. Hubbert finally sold Emanuel to a Mr.\r\nGrigway of Norfolk; with Emanuel Mr. G. was pretty well suited, but his\r\nwife was not--he had \"too much white blood in him\" for her. Grigway and\r\nhis wife were members of the Episcopal Church.\r\n\r\nIn this unhappy condition Emanuel found a conductor of the Underground\r\nRail Road. A secret passage was secured for him on one of the Richmond\r\nsteamers, and thus he escaped from his servitude. The Committee attended\r\nto his wants, and forwarded him on as usual. From Syracuse, where he was\r\nbreathing quite freely under the protection of the Rev. J.W. Loguen, he\r\nwrote the following letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n    SYRACUSE, July 29, 1857.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR FRIEND, MR. STILL:--I got safe through to Syracuse, and\r\n    found the house of our friend, Mr. J.W. Loguen. Many thanks to\r\n    you for your kindness to me. I wish to say to you, dear sir,\r\n    that I expect my clothes will be sent to Dr. Landa, and I wish,\r\n    if you please, get them and send them to the care of Mr. Loguen,\r\n    at Syracuse, for me He will be in possession of my whereabouts\r\n    and will send them to me. Remember me to Mr. Landa and Miss\r\n    Millen Jespan, and much to you and your family.\r\n\r\n    Truly Yours,\r\n\r\n    MANUAL T. WHITE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ESCAPE OF A CHILD FOURTEEN MONTHS OLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is found the following brief memorandum on the Records of the\r\nUnderground Rail Road Book, dated July, 1857:\r\n\r\n\"A little child of fourteen months old was conveyed to its mother, who\r\nhad been compelled to flee without it nearly nine months ago.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the circumstances connected with the coming of this slave child\r\nwere deeply interesting, no further particulars than the simple notice\r\nabove were at that time recorded. Fortunately, however, letters from the\r\ngood friends, who plucked this infant from the jaws of Slavery, have\r\nbeen preserved to throw light on this little one, and to show how\r\ntrue-hearted sympathizers with the Slave labored amid dangers and\r\ndifficulties to save the helpless bondman from oppression. It will be\r\nobserved, that both these friends wrote from Washington, D.C., the seat\r\nof Government, where, if Slavery was not seen in its worst aspects, the\r\nGovernment in its support of Slavery appeared in a most revolting light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM \"J.B.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    WASHINGTON, D.C., July 12, 1857.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:--Some of our citizens, I am told, lately left here for\r\n    Philadelphia, three of whom were arrested and brought back.\r\n\r\n    I beg you will inform me whether two others--(I., whose wife is\r\n    in Philadelphia, was one of them), ever reached your city.\r\n\r\n    To-morrow morning Mrs. Weems, _with her baby_, will start for\r\n    Philadelphia and see you probably over night.\r\n\r\n    Yours Truly,\r\n\r\n    J.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"J.B.\" was not only a trusty and capable conductor of the Underground\r\nRail Road in Washington, but was also a practical lawyer, at the same\r\ntime. His lawyer-like letter, in view of the critical nature of the\r\ncase, contained but few words, and those few naturally enough were\r\nsusceptible of more than one construction.\r\n\r\nDoubtless those styled \"our citizens,\"--\"three of whom were arrested and\r\nbrought back,\"--were causing great anxiety to this correspondent, not\r\nknowing how soon he might find himself implicated in the \"running off,\"\r\netc. So, while he felt it to be his duty, to still aid the child, he was\r\ndetermined, if the enemy intercepted his letter, he should not find much\r\ncomfort or information. The cause was safe in such careful hands. The\r\nfollowing letters, bearing on the same case, are also from another good\r\nconductor, who was then living in Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS FROM E.L. STEVENS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    WASHINGTON, D.C., July 8,1857.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SIR:--I write you now to let you know that the children\r\n    of E. are yet well, and that Mrs. Arrah Weems will start with\r\n    one of them for Philadelphia to-morrow or next day. She will be\r\n    with you probably in the day train. She goes for the purpose of\r\n    making an effort to redeem her last child, now in Slavery. The\r\n    whole amount necessary is raised, except about $300. She will\r\n    take her credentials with her, and you can place the most\r\n    implicit reliance on her statements. The story in regard to the\r\n    Weems' family was published in Frederick Douglass' paper two\r\n    years ago. Since then the two middle boys have been redeemed and\r\n    there is only one left in Slavery, and he is in Alabama. The\r\n    master has agreed to take for him just what he gave, $1100. Mr.\r\n    Lewis Tappan has his letter and the money, except the amount\r\n    specified. There were about $5000 raised in England to redeem\r\n    this family, and they are now all free except this one. And\r\n    there never was a more excellent and worthy family than the\r\n    Weems' family. I do hope, that Mrs. W. will find friends who can\r\n    advance the amount required.\r\n\r\n    Truly Yours,\r\n\r\n    E.L. STEVENS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    WASHINGTON, D.C., July 13th, 1857.\r\n\r\n    MY FRIEND:--Your kind letter in reply to mine about Arrah was\r\n    duly received. As she is doubtless with you before this, she\r\n    will explain all. I propose that a second journey be made by her\r\n    or some one else, in order to take the other. They have been a\r\n    great burden to the good folks here and should have been _at\r\n    home_ long ere this. Arrah will explain everything. I want,\r\n    however, to say a word in her behalf. If there is a person in\r\n    the world, that deserves the hearty co-operation of every friend\r\n    of humanity, that person is Arrah Weems, who now, after a long\r\n    series of self-sacrificing labor to aid others in their struggle\r\n    for their God-given rights, solicits a small amount to redeem\r\n    the last one of her own children in Slavery. Never have I had my\r\n    sympathies so aroused in behalf of any object as in behalf of\r\n    this most worthy family. She can tell you what I have done. And\r\n    I do hope, that our friends in Philadelphia and New York will\r\n    assist her to make up the full amount required for the purchase\r\n    of the boy.\r\n\r\n    After she does what she can in P., will you give her the proper\r\n    direction about getting to New York and to Mr. Tappan's? Inform\r\n    him of what she has done, &c.\r\n\r\n    Please write me as soon as you can as to whether she arrived\r\n    safely, &c. Give me your opinion, also, as to the proposal about\r\n    the other. Had you not better keep the little one in P. till the\r\n    other is taken there? Inform me also where E. is, how she is\r\n    getting along, &c., who living with, &c.\r\n\r\n    Yours Truly,\r\n\r\n    E.L.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this instance, also, as in the case of \"J.B.,\" the care and anxiety\r\nof other souls, besides this child, crying for deliverance, weighed\r\nheavily on the mind of Mr. Stevens, as may be inferred from certain\r\nreferences in his letters. Mr. Stevens' love of humanity, and impartial\r\nfreedom, even in those dark days of Slavery, when it was both unpopular\r\nand unsafe to allow the cries of the bondman to awaken the feeling of\r\nhumanity to assist the suffering, was constantly leading him to take\r\nsides with the oppressed, and as he appears in this correspondence, so\r\nit was his wont daily to aid the helpless, who were all around him.\r\nArrah Weems, who had the care of the child, alluded to so touchingly by\r\nMr. Stevens, had known, to her heart's sorrow, how intensely painful it\r\nwas to a mother's feelings to have her children torn from her by a cruel\r\nmaster and sold. For Arrah had had a number of children sold, and was at\r\nthat very time striving diligently to raise money to redeem the last one\r\nof them. And through such kind-hearted friends as Mr. Stevens, the\r\npeculiar hardships of this interesting family of Weems' were brought to\r\nthe knowledge of thousands of philanthropists in this country and\r\nEngland, and liberal contributions had already been made by friends of\r\nthe Slave on both sides of the ocean. It may now be seen, that while\r\nthis child had not been a conscious sufferer from the wicked system of\r\nSlavery, it had been the object of very great anxiety and suffering to\r\nseveral persons, who had individually perilled their own freedom for its\r\nredemption. This child, however, was safely brought to the Vigilance\r\nCommittee, in Philadelphia, and was duly forwarded, _viâ_ friends in New\r\nYork, to its mother, in Syracuse, where she had stopped to work and wait\r\nfor her little one, left behind at the time she escaped.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESCAPE OF A YOUNG SLAVE MOTHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEFT HER LITTLE BABY-BOY, LITTLE GIRL AND HUSBAND BEHIND.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe anxiously waits their coming in Syracuse, N.Y. Not until after the\r\nforegoing story headed, the \"Escape of a Child,\" etc., had been put into\r\nthe hands of the printer and was in type, was the story of the mother\r\ndiscovered, although it was among the records preserved. Under changed\r\nnames, in many instances, it has been found to be no easy matter to cull\r\nfrom a great variety of letters, records and advertisements, just when\r\nwanted, all the particulars essential to complete many of these\r\nnarratives. The case of the child, alluded to above, is a case in point.\r\nThus, however, while it is impossible to introduce the mother's story in\r\nits proper place, yet, since it has been found, it is too important and\r\ninteresting to be left out. It is here given as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    $300 REWARD.--RAN AWAY from the subscriber on Saturday, the 30th\r\n    of August, 1856, my SERVANT WOMAN, named EMELINE CHAPMAN, about\r\n    25 years of age; quite dark, slender built, speaks short, and\r\n    stammers some; with two children, one a female about two and a\r\n    half years old; the other a male, seven or eight months old,\r\n    bright color. I will give the above reward if they are delivered\r\n    to me in Washington.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    MRS. EMILY THOMPSON,\r\n\r\n    s23-TU, Th&st&\r\n\r\n    Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmeline Chapman, so particularly described in the \"Baltimore Sun\" of the\r\n23d of September, 1856, arrived by the regular Underground Rail Road\r\ntrain from Washington. In order to escape the responsibility attached to\r\nher original name, she adopted the name of Susan Bell. Thus for freedom\r\nshe was willing to forego her name, her husband, and even her little\r\nchildren. It was a serious sacrifice; but she had been threatened with\r\nthe auction block, and she well understood what that meant. With regard\r\nto usage, having lived away from her owner, Emeline did not complain of\r\nany very hard times. True, she had been kept at work very constantly,\r\nand her owner had very faithfully received all her hire. Emeline had not\r\neven been allowed enough of her hire to find herself in clothing, or\r\nanything for the support of her two children--for these non-essentials,\r\nher kind mistress allowed her to seek elsewhere, as best she could.\r\nEmeline's husband was named John Henry; her little girl she called\r\nMargaret Ann, and her babe she had named after its father, all with the\r\nbrand of Slavery upon them. The love of freedom, in the breast of this\r\nspirited young Slave-wife and mother, did not extinguish the love she\r\nbore to her husband and children, however otherwise her course, in\r\nleaving them, as she did, might appear. For it was just this kind of\r\nheroic and self-sacrificing struggle, that appealed to the hearts of men\r\nand compelled attention. The letters of Biglow and Stevens, relative to\r\nthe little child, prove this fact, and additional testimony found in the\r\nappended letter from Rev. J.W. Loguen conclusively confirms the same.\r\nIndeed, who could close his eyes and ears to the plaintive cries of such\r\na mother? Who could refrain from aiding on to freedom children honored\r\nin such a heroic parent?\r\n\r\n\r\n    SYRACUSE, Oct. 5, 1856.\r\n\r\n    DEAR FRIEND STILL:--I write to you for Mrs. Susan Bell, who was\r\n    at your city some time in September last. She is from Washington\r\n    city. She left her dear little children behind (two children).\r\n    She is stopping in our city, and wants to hear from her children\r\n    very much indeed. She wishes to know if you have heard from Mr.\r\n    Biglow, of Washington city. She will remain here until she can\r\n    hear from you. She feels very anxious about her children, I will\r\n    assure you. I should have written before this, but I have been\r\n    from home much of the time since she came to our city. She wants\r\n    to know if Mr. Biglow has heard anything about her husband. If\r\n    you have not written to Mr. Biglow, she wishes you would. She\r\n    sends her love to you and your dear family. She says that you\r\n    were all kind to her, and she does not forget it. You will\r\n    direct your letter to me, dear brother, and I will see that she\r\n    gets it.\r\n\r\n    Miss F.E. Watkins left our house yesterday for Ithaca, and other\r\n    places in that part of the State. Frederick Douglass, Wm. J.\r\n    Watkins and others were with us last week; Gerritt Smith with\r\n    others. Miss Watkins is doing great good in our part of the\r\n    State. We think much indeed of her. She is such a good and\r\n    glorious speaker, that we are all charmed with her. We have had\r\n    thirty-one fugitives in the last twenty-seven days; but you, no\r\n    doubt, have had many more than that. I hope the good Lord may\r\n    bless you and spare you long to do good to the hunted and\r\n    outraged among our brethren.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n\r\n    J.W. LOGUEN,\r\n\r\n    Agent of the Underground Rail Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL W. JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM THE \"DAILY DISPATCH\" OFFICE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sam\" was doing Slave labor at the office of the Richmond \"Daily\r\nDispatch,\" as a carrier of that thoroughly pro-slavery sheet. \"Sam\" had\r\npossessed himself somehow of a knowledge of reading and writing a\r\nlittle, and for the news of the day he had quite an itching ear. Also\r\nwith regard to his freedom he was quite solicitous. Being of an\r\nambitious turn of mind, he hired his time, for which he paid his master\r\n$175 per annum in regular quarterly payments. Besides paying this\r\namount, he had to find himself in board, clothing, and pay doctor's\r\nexpenses. He had had more than one owner in his life. The last one,\r\nhowever, he spoke of thus: \"His name is James B. Foster, of Richmond, a\r\nvery hard man. He owns three more Slaves besides myself.\" In escaping,\r\n\"Sam\" was obliged to leave his wife, who was owned by Christian Bourdon.\r\nHis attachment to her, judging from his frequent warm expressions of\r\naffection, was very strong. But, as strong as it was, he felt that he\r\ncould not consent to remain in slavery any longer. \"Sam\" had luckily\r\ncome across a copy of Uncle Tom's Cabin, and in perusing it, all his\r\nnotions with regard to \"Masters and Servants,\" soon underwent an entire\r\nchange, and he began to cast his eyes around him to see how he might get\r\nhis freedom. One who was thoroughly awake as he was to the idea of being\r\nfree, with a fair share of courage, could now and then meet with the\r\nopportunity to escape by the steamers or schooners coming North. Thus\r\nSamuel found the way open and on one of the steamers came to\r\nPhiladelphia. On arriving, he was put at once in the charge of the\r\nCommittee. While in their hands he seemed filled with astonishment at\r\nhis own achievements, and such spontaneous expressions as naturally\r\nflowed from his heart thrilled and amazed his new found friends, and\r\nabundant satisfaction was afforded, that Samuel Washington Johnson would\r\ndo no discredit to his fugitive comrades in Canada. So the Committee\r\ngladly aided him on his journey.\r\n\r\nAfter arriving in Canada, Samuel wrote frequently and intelligently. The\r\nsubjoined letter to his wife shows how deeply he was attached to her,\r\nand, at the same time, what his views were of Slavery. The member of the\r\nCommittee to whom it was sent with the request, that it should be\r\nforwarded to her, did not meet with the opportunity of doing so. A copy\r\nof it was preserved with other Underground Rail Road documents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM SAMUEL W. JOHNSON TO HIS WIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    My Dear Wife I now embrace this golden opportunity of writing a\r\n    few Lines to inform you that I am well at present engoying good\r\n    health and hope that these few lines may find you well also. My\r\n    dearest wife I have Left you and now I am in a foreign land\r\n    about fourteen hundred miles from you but though my wife my\r\n    thoughts are upon you all the time. My dearest Frances I hope\r\n    you will remember me now gust as same as you did when I were\r\n    there with you because my mind are with you night and day the\r\n    Love that I bear for you in my breast is greater than I thought\r\n    it was if I had thought I had so much Love for you I dont think\r\n    I ever could Left being I have escape I and has fled into a land\r\n    of freedom. I can but stop and look over my past Life and say\r\n    what a fool I was for staying in bondage as Long. My dear wife I\r\n    dont want you to get married before you send me some letters\r\n    because I never shall get married until I see you again. My mind\r\n    dont deceive and it appears to me as if I shall see you again at\r\n    my time of writing this letter I am desitute of money I have not\r\n    got in no business yet but when I do get into business I shall\r\n    write you and also remember you. Tell my Mother and Brother and\r\n    all enquiring friends that I am now safe in free state. I cant\r\n    tell where I am at present but Direct your Letters to Mr.\r\n    William Still in Philadelphia and I will get them. Answer this\r\n    as soon as you can if you please for if you write the same day\r\n    you receive it it will take a fortnight to reach me. No more to\r\n    relate at present but still remain your affectionate husband.\r\n    Mr. Still please defore this piece out if you please\r\n\r\n    SAMUEL WASHINGTON JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether Samuel ever met with the opportunity of communicating with his\r\nwife, the writer cannot say. But of all the trials which Slaves had to\r\nendure, the separations of husbands and wives were the most difficult to\r\nbear up under. Although feeling keenly the loss of his wife, Samuel's\r\nbreast swelled with the thought of freedom, as will be seen from the\r\nletter which he wrote immediately after landing in Canada:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ST. CATHARINE, UPPER CANADA WEST.\r\n\r\n    MR. WILLIAM STILL:--I am now in safety. I arrived at home safe\r\n    on the 11th inst at 12 o'clock M. So I hope that you will now\r\n    take it upon yourself to inform me something of that letter I\r\n    left at your house that night when I left there and write me\r\n    word how you are and how is your wife. I wish you may excuse\r\n    this letter for I am so full that I cannot express my mind at\r\n    all. I am only got $1.50 and I feel as if I had an independent\r\n    fortune but I don't want you to think that I am going to be idle\r\n    because I am on free ground and I shall always work though I am\r\n    not got nothing to do at present. Direct your letter to the post\r\n    office as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n    SAMUEL W. JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY FROM BALTIMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN AMOS, _alias_ HENRY JOHNSON, HARRIET, _alias_ MARY JANE JOHNSON\r\n(man and wife), and their four children, ANN REBECCA, WM. H., ELIZABETH\r\nand MARY ELLEN. Doubtless, in the eyes of a Slaveholder, a more\r\n\"likely-looking\" family could not readily be found in Baltimore, than\r\nthe one to be now briefly noticed. The mother and her children were\r\nowned by a young slave-holder, who went by the name of William Giddings,\r\nand resided in Prince George's county, Md. Harriet acknowledged, that\r\nshe had been treated \"tolerably well in earlier days\" for one in her\r\ncondition; but, as in so many instances in the experience of Slaves,\r\nlatterly, times had changed with her and she was compelled to serve\r\nunder a new master who oft-times treated her \"very severely.\" On one\r\noccasion, seven years previously, a brother of her owner for a trifling\r\noffence struck and kicked her so brutally, that she was immediately\r\nthrown into a fit of sickness, which lasted \"all one summer\"--from this\r\nshe finally recovered.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, about one year previous to her escape, she was\r\nseized by her owner and thrust into prison to be sold. In this instance\r\nthe interference of the Uncle of Harriet's master saved her from the\r\nauction block. The young master, was under age, and at the same time\r\nunder the guardianship of his Uncle. The young master had early acquired\r\nan ardent taste for fast horses, gambling, etc. Harriet felt, that her\r\nchances for the future in the hands of such a brutal master could not be\r\nother than miserable. Her husband had formerly been owned by John S.\r\nGiddings, who was said to have been a \"mild man.\" He had allowed Stephen\r\n(her husband) to buy himself, and for eighteen months prior to the\r\nflight, he had been what was called a free man. It should also be\r\nfurther stated in justice to Stephen's master, that he was so disgusted\r\nwith the manner in which Stephen's wife was treated, that he went so far\r\nas to counsel Stephen to escape with his wife and children. Here at\r\nleast is one instance where a Maryland slave-holder lends his influence\r\nto the Underground Rail Road cause. The counsel was accepted, and the\r\nfamily started on their perilous flight. And although they necessarily\r\nhad manifest trials and difficulties to discourage and beset them, they\r\nbattled bravely with all these odds and reached the Vigilance Committee\r\nsafely. Harriet was a bright mulatto, with marked features of character,\r\nand well made, with good address and quite intelligent. She was about\r\ntwenty-six years of age. The children also were remarkably fine-looking\r\nlittle creatures, but too young to know the horrors of Slavery. The\r\nCommittee at once relieved them of their heavy load of anxiety by\r\ncheering words and administering to their necessities with regard to\r\nfood, money, etc. After the family had somewhat recovered from the\r\nfatigue and travel-worn condition in which they arrived, and were\r\nprepared to resume their journey, the Committee gave them the strictest\r\ncaution with regard to avoiding slave-hunters, and also in reference to\r\nsuch points on the road where they would be most in danger of going\r\nastray from a lack of knowledge of the way. Then, with indescribable\r\nfeelings of sympathy, free tickets were tendered them, and they having\r\nbeen conducted to the depot, were sent on their way rejoicing.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIJAH HILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM RICHMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter many years of hard toiling for the support of others, the yoke\r\npressed so heavily upon Elijah's shoulders, that he could not endure\r\nSlave life any longer. In the hope of getting rid of his bondage, by\r\ndexterous management and a resolute mind, which most determined and\r\nthoughtful men exercise when undertaking to accomplish great objects, he\r\nset about contriving to gain his freedom. In proof of Elijah's\r\ntruthfulness, the advertisement of Mr. R.J. Christians is here offered,\r\nas taken from a Richmond paper, about the time that Elijah passed\r\nthrough Philadelphia on the Underground Rail Road, in 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\n    RAN AWAY--$500 REWARD.--Left the Tobacco Factory of the\r\n    subscriber on the 14th inst., on the pretence of being sick, a\r\n    mulatto man, named ELIJAH, the property of Maj. Edward Johnson,\r\n    of Chesterfield county. He is about 5 feet 8 or 10 inches high,\r\n    spare made, bushy hair, and very genteel appearance; he is\r\n    supposed to be making his way North. The above reward will be\r\n    paid if delivered at my factory.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    Ro. J. CHRISTIANS.\r\n\r\n    jy 21--ts.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom his infancy up to the hour of his escape, not a breath of free air\r\nhad he ever been permitted to breathe. He was first owned by Mrs.\r\nCaroline Johnson, \"a stingy widow, the owner of about fifty slaves, and\r\na member of Dr. Plummer's church.\" Elijah, at her death, was willed to\r\nher son, Major Johnson, who was in the United States service. Elijah\r\nspoke of him as a \"favorable man,\" but added, \"I'd rather be free. I\r\nbelieve I can treat myself better than he can or anybody else.\" For the\r\nlast nineteen years he had been hired out, sometimes as waiter,\r\nsometimes in a tobacco factory, and for five years in the _Coal Mines_.\r\n\r\nAt the mines he was treated very brutally, but at Cornelius Hall's\r\nTobacco factory, the suffering he had to endure seems almost incredible.\r\nThe poor fellow, with the scars upon his person and the unmistakable\r\nearnestness of his manner, only needed to be seen and heard to satisfy\r\nthe most incredulous of the truth of his story. For refusing to be\r\nflogged, one time at Hall's Factory, the overseer, in a rage, \"took up a\r\nhickory club\" and laid his head \"open on each side.\" Overpowered and\r\nwounded, he was stripped naked and compelled to receive THREE HUNDRED\r\nLASHES, by which he was literally excoriated from head to foot. For six\r\nmonths afterwards he was \"laid up.\" Last year he was hired out for \"one\r\nhundred and eighty dollars,\" out of which he \"received but five\r\ndollars.\" This year he brought \"one hundred and ninety dollars.\" Up to\r\nthe time he escaped, he had received \"two dollars,\" and the promise of\r\n\"more at Christmas.\" Left brothers and sisters, all ignorant of his way\r\nof escape. The following pass brought away by Elijah speaks for itself,\r\nand will doubtless be interesting to some of our readers who are\r\nignorant of what used to be Republican usages in the \"land of the Free.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    RICHMOND, July 3d, 1857.\r\n\r\n    Permit the Bearer _Elijah_ to pass to and from my FACTORY, to\r\n    _Frederick Williams, In the Vallie_, for one month, untill 11\r\n    o'clock at night.\r\n\r\n    By _A.B. Wells_,\r\n\r\n    R.J. CHRISTIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [PINE APPLE FACTORY.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs usual, the Vigilance Committee tendered aid to Elijah, and forwarded\r\nhim on to Canada, whence he wrote back as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    TORONTO, Canada West, July 28. Dear friend in due respect to\r\n    your humanity and nobility I now take my pen in hand to inform\r\n    you of my health. I am enjoying a reasonable proportion of\r\n    health at this time and hope when these few lines come to hand\r\n    they may find you and family the same dear Sir I am in Toronto\r\n    and are working at my ole branch of business with meny of my\r\n    friends. I want you to send those to toronto to Mr Tueharts on\r\n    Edward St what I have been talking about is my Clothes I came\r\n    from Richmond Va and expect my things to come to you. So when\r\n    they come to you then you will send them to Jesse Tuehart Edward\r\n    St no 43.\r\n\r\n    I must close by saying I have no more at present. I still remain\r\n    your brother,\r\n\r\n    ELIJAH HILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLOMON BROWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVED PER CITY OF RICHMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis candidate for Canada managed to secure a private berth on the\r\nsteamship City of Richmond. He was thus enabled to leave his old\r\nmistress, Mary A. Ely, in Norfolk, the place of her abode, and the field\r\nof his servitude. Solomon was only twenty-two years of age, rather under\r\nthe medium size, dark color, and of much natural ability. He viewed\r\nSlavery as a great hardship, and for a length of time had been watching\r\nfor an opportunity to free himself. He had been in the habit of hiring\r\nhis time of his mistress, for which he paid ten dollars per month. This\r\namount failed to satisfy the mistress, as she was inclined to sell him\r\nto North Carolina, where Slave stock, at that time, was commanding high\r\nprices. The idea of North Carolina and a new master made Solomon rather\r\nnervous, and he was thereby prompted to escape. On reaching the\r\nCommittee he manifested very high appreciation of the attention paid\r\nhim, and after duly resting for a day, he was sent on his way rejoicing.\r\nSeven days after leaving Philadelphia, he wrote back from Canada as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ST. CATHARINES, Feb. 20th, 1854.\r\n\r\n    MR. STILL--DEAR SIR:--It is with great pleasure that I have to\r\n    inform you, that I have arrived safe in a land of freedom.\r\n    Thanks to kind friends that helped me here. Thank God that I am\r\n    treading on free soil. I expect to go to work to-morrow in a\r\n    steam factory.\r\n\r\n    I would like to have you, if it is not too much trouble, see Mr.\r\n    Minhett, the steward on the boat that I came out on, when he\r\n    gets to Norfolk, to go to the place where my clothes are, and\r\n    bring them to you, and you direct them to the care of Rev. Hiram\r\n    Wilson, St. Catharines, Niagara District, Canada West, by\r\n    rail-road via Suspension Bridge. You mentioned if I saw Mr.\r\n    Foreman. I was to deliver a message--he is not here. I saw two\r\n    yesterday in church, from Norfolk, that I had known there. You\r\n    will send my name, James Henry, as you knew me by that name;\r\n    direct my things to James Henry. My love to your wife and\r\n    children.\r\n\r\n    Yours Respectfully,\r\n\r\n    SOLOMON BROWN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HOGG, ALIAS JOHN SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAVELER FROM MARYLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam fled from Lewis Roberts, who followed farming in Baltimore\r\ncounty, Md. In speaking of him, William gave him the character of being\r\na \"fierce and rough man,\" who owned nine head of slaves. Two of\r\nWilliam's sisters were held by Roberts, when he left. His excuse for\r\nrunning away was, \"ill-treatment.\" In traveling North, he walked to\r\nColumbia (in Pennsylvania), and there took the cars for Philadelphia.\r\nThe Committee took charge of him, and having given him the usual aid,\r\nsent him hopefully on his way. After safely reaching Canada, the thought\r\nof his wife in a land of bondage, pressed so deeply upon his mind, that\r\nhe was prompted to make an effort to rescue her. The following letter,\r\nwritten on his behalf by the Rev. H. Wilson, indicates his feelings and\r\nwishes with regard to her:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ST. CATHARINES, Canada West, 24th July, 1854.\r\n\r\n    DEAR FRIEND, WILLIAM STILL:--Your encouraging letter, to John\r\n    Smith, was duly received by him, and I am requested to write\r\n    again on his behalf. His colored friend in Baltimore county, who\r\n    would favor his designs, is Thomas Cook, whom he wishes you to\r\n    address, Baltimore post-office, care of Mr. Thomas Spicer.\r\n\r\n    He has received a letter from Thomas Cook, dated the 6th of\r\n    June, but it was a long time reaching him. He wishes you to say\r\n    to Cook, that he got his letter, and that he would like to have\r\n    him call on his wife and make known to her, that he is in good\r\n    health, doing well here, and would like to have her come on as\r\n    soon as she can.\r\n\r\n    As she is a free woman, there will, doubtless, be no difficulty\r\n    in her coming right through. He is working in the neighborhood\r\n    of St. Catharines, but twelve miles from Niagara Falls. You will\r\n    please recollect to address Thomas Cook, in the care of Thomas\r\n    Spicer, Baltimore Post-office. Smith's wife is at, or near the\r\n    place he came from, and, doubtless, Thomas Cook knows all about\r\n    her condition and circumstances. Please write again to John\r\n    Smith, in my care, if you please, and request Thomas Cook to do\r\n    the same.\r\n\r\n    Very respectfully yours in the cause of philanthropy.\r\n\r\n    HIRAM WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO FEMALE PASSENGERS FEOM MARYLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the way of travel, _viâ_ the Underground Rail Road, under the most\r\nfavorable circumstances, even for the sterner sex, was hard enough to\r\ntest the strongest nerves, and to try the faith of the bravest of the\r\nbrave, every woman, who won her freedom, by this perilous undertaking,\r\ndeserves commemoration. It is, therefore, a pleasure to thus transfer\r\nfrom the old Record book the names of Ann Johnson and Lavina Woolfley,\r\nwho fled from Maryland in 1857. Their lives, however, had not been in\r\nany way very remarkable. Ann was tall, and of a dark chestnut color,\r\nwith an intelligent countenance, and about twenty-four years of age. She\r\nhad filled various situations as a Slave. Sometimes she was required to\r\nserve in the kitchen, at other times she was required to toil in the\r\nfield, with the plow, hoe, and the like. Samuel Harrington, of Cambridge\r\nDistrict, Maryland, was the name of the man for whose benefit Ann\r\nlabored during her younger days. She had no hesitation in saying, that\r\nhe was a very \"ill-natured man;\" he however, was a member of the \"old\r\ntime Methodist Church.\" In Slave property he had invested only to the\r\nextent of some five or six head. About three years previous to Ann's\r\nescape, one of her brothers fled and went to Canada. This circumstance\r\nso enraged the owner, that he declared he would \"sell all\" he owned.\r\nAccordingly Ann was soon put on the auction block, and was bought by a\r\nman who went by the name of William Moore. Moore was a married man, who,\r\nwith his wife, was addicted to intemperance and carousing. Ann found\r\nthat she had simply got \"out of the fire into the frying-pan.\" She was\r\nreally at a loss to tell when her lot was the harder, whether under the\r\n\"rum drinker,\" or the old time Methodist. In this state of mind she\r\ndecided to leave all and go to Canada, the refuge for the fleeing\r\nbondman. Lavina, Ann's companion, was the wife of James Woolfley. She\r\nand her husband set out together, with six others, and were of the party\r\nof eight who were betrayed into Dover jail, as has already been\r\ndescribed in these pages. After fighting their way out of the jail, they\r\nseparated (for prudential reasons). The husband of Lavina, immediately\r\nafter the conflict at the jail, passed on to Canada, leaving his wife\r\nunder the protection of friends. Since that time several months had\r\nelapsed, but of each other nothing had been known, before she received\r\ninformation on her arrival at Philadelphia. The Committee was glad to\r\ninform her, that her husband had safely passed on to Canada, and that\r\nshe would be aided on also, where they could enjoy freedom in a free\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN F. AND THE MAYOR OF NORFOLK.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWENTY-ONE PASSENGERS SECRETED IN A BOAT. NOVEMBER, 1855.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN F. was certainly no ordinary man. Although he had been living a\r\nsea-faring life for many years, and the marks of this calling were\r\nplainly enough visible in his manners and speech, he was, nevertheless,\r\nunlike the great mass of this class of men, not addicted to intemperance\r\nand profanity. On the contrary, he was a man of thought, and possessed,\r\nin a large measure, those humane traits of character which lead men to\r\nsympathize with suffering humanity wherever met with.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, however, that the first impressions gathered from a\r\nhasty survey of his rough and rugged appearance, his large head, large\r\nmouth, large eyes, and heavy eye-brows, with a natural gift at keeping\r\nconcealed the inner-workings of his mind and feelings, were not\r\ncalculated to inspire the belief, that he was fitted to be entrusted\r\nwith the lives of unprotected females, and helpless children; that he\r\ncould take pleasure in risking his own life to rescue them from the hell\r\nof Slavery; that he could deliberately enter the enemy's domain, and\r\nwith the faith of a martyr, face the dread slave-holder, with his\r\nBowie-knives and revolvers--Slave-hunters, and blood-hounds, lynchings,\r\nand penitentiaries, for humanity's sake. But his deeds proved him to be\r\na true friend of the Slave; whilst his skill, bravery, and success\r\nstamped him as one of the most daring and heroic Captains ever connected\r\nwith the Underground Rail Road cause.\r\n\r\nAt the time he was doing most for humanity in rescuing bondsmen from\r\nSlavery, Slave-laws were actually being the most rigidly executed. To\r\nshow mercy, in any sense, to man or woman, who might be caught assisting\r\na poor Slave to flee from the prison-house, was a matter not to be\r\nthought of in Virginia. This was perfectly well understood by Captain\r\nF.; indeed he did not hesitate to say, that his hazardous operations\r\nmight any day result in the \"sacrifice\" of his life. But on this point\r\nhe seemed to give himself no more concern than he would have done to\r\nknow which way the wind would blow the next day. He had his own\r\nconvictions about dying and the future, and he declared, that he had \"no\r\nfear of death,\" however it might come. Still, he was not disposed to be\r\nreckless or needlessly to imperil his life, or the lives of those he\r\nundertook to aid. Nor was he averse to receiving compensation for his\r\nservices. In Richmond, Norfolk, Petersburg, and other places where he\r\ntraded, many slaves were fully awake to their condition. The great slave\r\nsales were the agencies that served to awaken a large number. Then the\r\nvarious mechanical trades were necessarily given to the Slaves, for the\r\nmaster had no taste for \"greasy, northern mechanics.\" Then, again, the\r\nstores had to be supplied with porters, draymen, etc., from the slave\r\npopulation. In the hearts of many of the more intelligent amongst the\r\nslaves, the men, as mechanics, etc., the women, as dress-makers,\r\nchamber-maids, etc., notwithstanding all the opposition and hard laws,\r\nthe spirit of Freedom was steadily burning. Many of the slaves were half\r\nbrothers, and sisters, cousins, nephews, and nieces to their owners, and\r\nof course \"blood would tell.\"\r\n\r\nIt was only necessary for the fact to be made known to a single reliable\r\nand intelligent slave, that a man with a boat running North had the love\r\nof Freedom for all mankind in his bosom to make that man an object of\r\nthe greatest interest. If an angel had appeared amongst them doubtless\r\nhis presence would not have inspired greater anxiety and hope than did\r\nthe presence of Captain F. The class most anxious to obtain freedom\r\ncould generally manage to acquire some means which they would willingly\r\noffer to captains or conductors in the South for such assistance as was\r\nindispensable to their escape. Many of the slaves learned if they could\r\nmanage to cross Mason and Dixon's line, even though they might be\r\nutterly destitute and penniless, that they would then receive aid and\r\nprotection from the Vigilance Committee. Here it may be well to state\r\nthat, whilst the Committee gladly received and aided all who might come\r\nor be brought to them, they never employed agents or captains to go into\r\nthe South with a view of enticing or running off slaves. So when\r\ncaptains operated, they did so with the full understanding that they\r\nalone were responsible for any failures attending their movements.\r\n\r\nThe way is now clear to present Captain F. with his schooner lying at\r\nthe wharf in Norfolk, loading with wheat, and at the same time with\r\ntwenty-one fugitives secreted therein. While the boat was thus lying at\r\nher mooring, the rumor was flying all over town that a number of slaves\r\nhad escaped, which created a general excitement a degree less, perhaps,\r\nthan if the citizens had been visited by an earthquake. The mayor of the\r\ncity with a posse of officers with axes and long spears repaired to\r\nCaptain F.'s boat. The fearless commander received his Honor very\r\ncoolly, and as gracefully as the circumstances would admit. The mayor\r\ngave him to understand who he was, and by what authority he appeared on\r\nthe boat, and what he meant to do. \"Very well,\" replied Captain F.,\r\n\"here I am and this is my boat, go ahead and search.\" His Honor with his\r\ndeputies looked quickly around, and then an order went forth from the\r\nmayor to \"spear the wheat thoroughly.\" The deputies obeyed the command\r\nwith alacrity. But the spears brought neither blood nor groans, and the\r\nsagacious mayor obviously concluded that he was \"barking up the wrong\r\ntree.\" But the mayor was not there for nothing. \"Take the axes and go to\r\nwork,\" was the next order; and the axe was used with terrible effect by\r\none of the deputies. The deck and other parts of the boat were chopped\r\nand split; no greater judgment being exercised when using the axe than\r\nwhen spearing the wheat; Captain F. all the while wearing an air of\r\nutter indifference or rather of entire composure. Indeed every step they\r\ntook proved conclusively that they were wholly ignorant with regard to\r\nboat searching. At this point, with remarkable shrewdness, Captain F.\r\nsaw wherein he could still further confuse them by a bold strategical\r\nmove. As though about out of patience with the mayor's blunders, the\r\ncaptain instantly reminded his Honor that he had \"stood still long\r\nenough\" while his boat was being \"damaged, chopped up,\" &c. \"Now if you\r\nwant to search,\" continued he, \"give me the axe, and then point out the\r\nspot you want opened and I will open it for you very quick.\" While\r\nuttering these words he presented, as he was capable of doing, an\r\nindignant and defiant countenance, and intimated that it mattered not\r\nwhere or when a man died provided he was in the right, and as though he\r\nwished to give particularly strong emphasis to what he was saying, he\r\nraised the axe, and brought it down edge foremost on the deck with\r\nstartling effect, at the same time causing the splinters to fly from the\r\nboards. The mayor and his posse seemed, if not dreadfully frightened,\r\ncompletely confounded, and by the time Captain F. had again brought down\r\nhis axe with increased power, demanding where they would have him open,\r\nthey looked as though it was time for them to retire, and in a few\r\nminutes after they actually gave up the search and left the boat without\r\nfinding a soul. Daniel in the lions' den was not safer than were the\r\ntwenty-one passengers secreted on Captain F.'s boat. The law had been\r\ncarried out with a vengeance, but did not avail with this skilled\r\ncaptain. The \"five dollars\" were paid for being searched, the amount\r\nwhich was lawfully required of every captain sailing from Virginia. And\r\nthe captain steered direct for the City of Brotherly Love. The wind of\r\nheaven favoring the good cause, he arrived safely in due time, and\r\ndelivered his precious freight in the vicinity of Philadelphia within\r\nthe reach of the Vigilance Committee. The names of the passengers were\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mayor and Police of Norfolk on Capt. Fountain's\r\nschooner.]\r\n\r\nALAN TATUM, DANIEL CARR, MICHAEL VAUGHN, THOMAS NIXON, FREDERICK NIXON,\r\nPETER PETTY, NATHANIEL GARDENER, JOHN BROWN, THOMAS FREEMAN, JAMES\r\nFOSTER, GODFREY SCOTT, WILLIS WILSON, NANCY LITTLE, JOHN SMITH, FRANCIS\r\nHAINES, DAVID JOHNSON, PHILLIS GAULT, ALICE JONES, NED WILSON, and SARAH\r\nC. WILSON, and one other, who subsequently passed on, having been\r\ndetained on account of sickness. These passengers were most\r\n\"likely-looking articles;\" a number of them, doubtless, would have\r\ncommanded the very highest prices in the Richmond market. Among them\r\nwere some good mechanics--one excellent dress-maker, some \"prime\"\r\nwaiters and chambermaids;--men and women with brains, some of them\r\nevincing remarkable intelligence and decided bravery, just the kind of\r\npassengers that gave the greatest satisfaction to the Vigilance\r\nCommittee. The interview with these passengers was extremely\r\ninteresting. Each one gave his or her experience of Slavery, the escape,\r\netc., in his or her own way, deeply impressing those who had the\r\nprivilege of seeing and hearing them, with the fact of the growing\r\nspirit of Liberty, and the wonderful perception and intelligence\r\npossessed by some of the sons of toil in the South. While all the names\r\nof these passengers were duly entered on the Underground Rail Road\r\nrecords, the number was too large, and the time they spent with the\r\nattempts to escape were made by Daniel, after being sold to North\r\nCarolina; for this offence, he was on one occasion stripped naked, and\r\nflogged severely. This did not cure him. Prior to his joining Captain\r\nF.'s party, he had fled to the swamps, and dwelt there for three months,\r\nsurrounded with wild animals and reptiles, and it was this state of\r\nsolitude that he left directly before finding Captain F. Daniel had a\r\nwife in Portsmouth, to whom he succeeded in paying a private visit,\r\nwhen, to his unspeakable joy, he made the acquaintance of the noble\r\nCaptain F., whose big heart was delighted to give him a passage North.\r\nDaniel, after being sold, had been allowed, within the two years, only\r\none opportunity of visiting his wife; being thus debarred he resolved to\r\nescape. His wife, whose name was Hannah, had three\r\nchildren--slaves--their names were Sam, Dan, and \"baby.\" The name of the\r\nlatter was unknown to him.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL VAUGHN. Michael was about thirty-one years of age, with superior\r\nphysical proportions, and no lack of common sense. His color was without\r\npaleness--dark and unfading, and his manly appearance was quite\r\nstriking. Michael belonged to a lady, whom he described as a \"very\r\ndisagreeable woman.\" \"For all my life I have belonged to her, but for\r\nthe last eight years I have hired my time. I paid my mistress $120 a\r\nyear; a part of the time I had to find my board and all my clothing.\"\r\nThis was the direct, and unequivocal testimony that Michael gave of his\r\nslave life, which was the foundation for alleging that his mistress was\r\na \"very disagreeable woman.\"\r\n\r\nMichael left a wife and one child in Slavery; but they were not owned by\r\nhis mistress. Before escaping, he felt afraid to lead his companion into\r\nthe secret of his contemplated movements, as he felt, that there was no\r\npossible way for him to do anything for her deliverance; on the other\r\nhand, any revelation of the matter might prove too exciting for the poor\r\nsoul;--her name was Esther. That he did not lose his affection for her\r\nwhom he was obliged to leave so unceremoniously, is shown by the\r\nappended letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n    NEW BEDFORD, August 22d, 1855.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:--I send you this to inform you that I expect my wife\r\n    to come that way. If she should, you will direct her to me. When\r\n    I came through your city last Fall, you took my name in your\r\n    office, which was then given you, Michael Vaughn; since then my\r\n    name is William Brown, No. 130 Kempton street. Please give my\r\n    wife and child's name to Dr. Lundy, and tell him to attend to it\r\n    for me. Her name is Esther, and the child's name Louisa.\r\n\r\n    Truly yours,\r\n\r\n    WILLIAM BROWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael worked in a foundry. In church fellowship he was connected with\r\nthe Methodists--his mistress with the Baptists.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS NIXON was about nineteen years of age, of a dark hue, and quite\r\nintelligent. He had not much excuse to make for leaving, except, that he\r\nwas \"tired of staying\" with his \"owner,\" as he \"feared he might be sold\r\nsome day,\" so he \"thought\" that he might as well save him the trouble.\r\nThomas belonged to a Mr. Bockover, a wholesale grocer, No. 12 Brewer\r\nstreet. Thomas left behind him his mother and three brothers. His father\r\nwas sold away when he was an infant, consequently he never saw him.\r\nThomas was a member of the Methodist Church; his master was of the same\r\npersuasion.\r\n\r\nFREDERICK NIXON was about thirty-three years of age, and belonged truly\r\nto the wide-awake class of slaves, as his marked physical and mental\r\nappearance indicated. He had a more urgent excuse for escaping than\r\nThomas; he declared that he fled because, his owner wanted \"to work him\r\nhard without allowing him any chance, and had treated him rough.\"\r\nFrederick was also one of Mr. Bockover's chattels; he left his wife,\r\nElizabeth, with four children in bondage. They were living in Eatontown,\r\nNorth Carolina. It had been almost one year since he had seen them. Had\r\nhe remained in Norfolk he had not the slightest prospect of being\r\nreunited to his wife and children, as he had been already separated from\r\nthem for about three years. This painful state of affairs only increased\r\nhis desire to leave those who were brutal enough to make such havoc in\r\nhis domestic relations.\r\n\r\nPETER PETTY was about twenty-four years of age, and wore a happy\r\ncountenance; he was a person of agreeable manners, and withal pretty\r\nsmart. He acknowledged, that he had been owned by Joseph Boukley, Hair\r\nInspector. Peter did not give Mr. Boukley a very good character,\r\nhowever; he said, that Mr. B. was \"rowdyish in his habits, was deceitful\r\nand sly, and would sell his slaves any time. Hard bondage--something\r\nlike the children of Israel,\" was his simple excuse for fleeing. He\r\nhired his time of his master, for which he was compelled to pay $156 a\r\nyear. When he lost time by sickness or rainy weather, he was required to\r\nmake up the deficiency, also find his clothing. He left a\r\nwife--Lavinia--and one child, Eliza, both slaves. Peter communicated to\r\nhis wife his secret intention to leave, and she acquiesced in his going.\r\nHe left his parents also. All his sisters and brothers had been sold.\r\nPeter would have been sold too, but his owner was under the impression,\r\nthat he was \"too good a Christian\" to violate the laws by running away.\r\nPeter's master was quite a devoted Methodist, and was attached to the\r\nsame Church with Peter. While on the subject of religion, Peter was\r\nasked about the kind and character of preaching that he had been\r\naccustomed to hear; whereupon he gave the following graphic specimen:\r\n\"Servants obey your masters; good servants make good masters;  when your\r\nmistress speaks to you don't pout out your mouths; when you want to go\r\nto church ask your mistress and master,\" etc., etc. Peter declared, that\r\nhe had never heard but one preacher speak against slavery, and that \"one\r\nwas obliged to leave suddenly for the North.\" He said, that a Quaker\r\nlady spoke in meeting against Slavery one day, which resulted in an\r\noutbreak, and final breaking up of the meeting.\r\n\r\nPHILLIS GAULT. Phillis was a widow, about thirty years of age; the blood\r\nof two races flowed in about equal proportions through her veins. Such\r\nwas her personal appearance, refinement, manners, and intelligence, that\r\nhad the facts of her slave life been unknown, she would have readily\r\npassed for one who had possessed superior advantages. But the facts in\r\nher history proved, that she had been made to feel very keenly the\r\nhorrifying effects of Slavery; not in the field, for she had never\r\nworked there; nor as a common drudge, for she had always been required\r\nto fill higher spheres; she was a dress-maker--but not without fear of\r\nthe auction block. This dreaded destiny was the motive which constrained\r\nher to escape with the twenty others; secreted in the hold of a vessel\r\nexpressly arranged for bringing away slaves. Death had robbed her of her\r\nhusband at the time that the fever raged so fearfully in Norfolk. This\r\nsad event deprived her of the hope she had of being purchased by her\r\nhusband, as he had intended. She was haunted by the constant thought of\r\nagain being sold, as she had once been, and as she had witnessed the\r\nsale of her sister's four children after the death of their mother.\r\n\r\nPhillis was, to use her own striking expression in a state of \"great\r\nhorror;\" she felt, that nothing would relieve her but freedom. After\r\nhaving fully pondered the prospect of her freedom and the only mode\r\noffered by which she could escape, she consented to endure bravely\r\nwhatever of suffering and trial might fall to her lot in the\r\nundertaking--and as was the case with thousands of others, she\r\nsucceeded. She remained several days in the family of a member of the\r\nCommittee in Philadelphia, favorably impressing all who saw her. As she\r\nhad formed a very high opinion of Boston, from having heard it so\r\nthoroughly reviled in Norfolk, she desired to go there. The Committee\r\nmade no objections, gave her a free ticket, etc. From that time to the\r\npresent, she has ever sustained a good Christian character, and as an\r\nindustrious, upright, and intelligent woman, she has been and is highly\r\nrespected by all who know her. The following letter is characteristic of\r\nher:\r\n\r\n\r\n    BOSTON, March 22, 1858.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SIR--I received your photograph by Mr Cooper and it\r\n    afforded me much pleasure to do so i hope that these few lines\r\n    may find you and your family well as it leaves me and little\r\n    Dicky at present i have no interesting news to tell you more\r\n    than there is a great revival of religion through the land i all\r\n    most forgoten to thank you for your kindness and our little Dick\r\n    he is very wild and goes to school and it is my desire and\r\n    prayer for him to grow up a useful man i wish you would try to\r\n    gain some information from Norfolk and write me word how the\r\n    times are there for i am afraid to write. i wish yoo would see\r\n    the Doctor for me and ask him if he could carefully find out any\r\n    way that we could steal little Johny for i think to raise nine\r\n    or ten hundred dollars for such a child is outraigust. just at\r\n    this time i feel as if i would rather steal him than to buy him.\r\n    give my kinde regards to the Dr and his family tell Miss Margret\r\n    and Mrs Landy that i would like to see them out here this summer\r\n    again to have a nice time in Cambridge Miss Walker that spent\r\n    the evening with me in Cambridge sens much love to yoo and Mrs.\r\n    Landy give my kindes regards to Mrs Still and children and\r\n    receive a portion for yoo self. i have no more to say at present\r\n    but remain yoor respectfully.\r\n\r\n    FLARECE P.

Gault, No 62\r\n    Pinkney St.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVALS FROM DIFFERENT PLACES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMATILDA MAHONEY,--DR. J.W. PENNINGTON'S BROTHER AND SONS CAPTURED AND\r\nCARRIED BACK.\r\n\r\nWhile many sympathized with the slave in his chains, and freely wept\r\nover his destiny, or gave money to help buy his freedom, but few could\r\nbe found who were willing to take the risk of going into the South, and\r\nstanding face to face with Slavery, in order to conduct a panting slave\r\nto freedom. The undertaking was too fearful to think of in most cases.\r\nBut there were instances when men and women too, moved by the love of\r\nfreedom, would take their lives in their hands, beard the lion in his\r\nden, and nobly rescue the oppressed. Such an instance is found in the\r\ncase of Matilda Mahoney, in Baltimore.\r\n\r\nThe story of Matilda must be very brief, although it is full of\r\nthrilling interest. She was twenty-one years of age in 1854, when she\r\nescaped and came to Philadelphia, a handsome young woman, of a light\r\ncomplexion, quite refined in her manners, and in short, possessing great\r\npersonal attractions. But her situation as a slave was critical, as will\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\nHer claimant was Wm. Rigard, of Frederick, Md., who hired her to a Mr.\r\nReese, in Baltimore; in this situation her duties were general housework\r\nand nursing. With these labors, she was not, however, so much\r\ndissatisfied as she was with other circumstances of a more alarming\r\nnature: her old master was tottering on the verge of the grave, and his\r\nson, a trader in New Orleans. These facts kept Matilda in extreme\r\nanxiety. For two years prior to her escape, the young trader had been\r\ntrying to influence his father to let him have her for the Southern\r\nmarket; but the old man had not consented. Of course the trader knew\r\nquite well, that an \"article\" of her appearance would command readily a\r\nvery high price in the New Orleans market. But Matilda's attractions had\r\nwon the heart of a young man in the North, one who had known her in\r\nBaltimore in earlier days, and this lover was willing to make desperate\r\nefforts to rescue her from her perilous situation. Whether or not he had\r\nnerve enough to venture down to Baltimore to accompany his intended away\r\non the Underground Rail Road, his presence would not have aided in the\r\ncase. He had, however, a friend who consented to go to Baltimore on this\r\ndesperate mission. The friend was James Jefferson, of Providence, R.I.\r\nWith the strategy of a skilled soldier, Mr. Jefferson hurried to the\r\nMonumental City, and almost under the eyes of the slave-holders, and\r\nslave-catchers, despite of pro slavery breastworks, seized his prize and\r\nspeeded her away on the Underground Railway, before her owner was made\r\nacquainted with the fact of her intended escape. On Matilda's arrival at\r\nthe station in Philadelphia, several other passengers from different\r\npoints, happened to come to hand just at that time, and gave great\r\nsolicitude and anxiety to the Committee. Among these were a man and his\r\nwife and their four children, (noticed elsewhere), from Maryland.\r\nLikewise an interesting and intelligent young girl who had been almost\r\nmiraculously rescued from the prison-house at Norfolk, and in addition\r\nto these, the brother of J.W. Pennington, D.D., with his two sons.\r\n\r\nWhile it was a great gratification to have travelers coming along so\r\nfast, and especially to observe in every countenance, determination,\r\nrare manly and womanly bearing, with remarkable intelligence, it must be\r\nadmitted, that the acting committee felt at the same time, a very lively\r\ndread of the slave-hunters, and were on their guard. Arrangements were\r\nmade to send the fugitives on by different trains, and in various\r\ndirections. Matilda and all the others with the exception of the father\r\nand two sons (relatives of Dr. Pennington) successfully escaped and\r\nreached their longed-for haven in a free land. The Penningtons, however,\r\nalthough pains had been taken to apprize the Doctor of the good news of\r\nthe coming of his kin, whom he had not seen for many, many years, were\r\ncaptured after being in New York some twenty-four hours. In answer to an\r\nadvisory letter from the secretary of the Committee the following from\r\nthe Doctor is explicit, relative to his wishes and feelings with regard\r\nto their being sent on to New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n    29 6th AVENUE, NEW YORK, May 24th, 1854.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MR. STILL:--Your kind letter of the 22d inst has come to\r\n    hand and I have to thank you for your offices of benevolence to\r\n    my bone and my flesh, I have had the pleasure of doing a little\r\n    for your brother Peter, but I do not think it an offset. My\r\n    burden has been great about these brethren. I hope they have\r\n    started on to me. Many thanks, my good friend.\r\n\r\n    Yours Truly.\r\n\r\n    J.W.C. PENNINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter only served to intensify the deep interest which had already\r\nbeen awakened for the safety of all concerned. At the same time also it\r\nmade the duty of the Committee clear with regard to forwarding them to\r\nN.Y. Immediately, therefore, the Doctor's brother and sons were\r\nfurnished with free tickets and were as carefully cautioned as possible\r\nwith regard to slave-hunters, if encountered on the road. In company\r\nwith several other Underground Rail Road passengers, under the care of\r\nan intelligent guide, all were sent off in due order, looking quite as\r\nwell as the most respectable of their race from any part of the country.\r\nThe Committee in New York, with the Doctor, were on the look out of\r\ncourse; thus without difficulty all arrived safely in the Empire City.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the coming of his brother and sons so overpowered the\r\nDoctor that he forgot how imminent their danger was. The meeting and\r\ninterview was doubtless very joyous. Few perhaps could realize, even in\r\nimagination, the feelings that filled their hearts, as the Doctor and\r\nhis brother reverted to their boyhood, when they were both slaves\r\ntogether in Maryland; the separation--the escape of the former many\r\nyears previous--the contrast, one elevated to the dignity of a Doctor of\r\nDivinity, a scholar and noted clergyman, and as such well known in the\r\nUnited States, and Great Britain, whilst, at the same time, his brother\r\nand kin were held in chains, compelled to do unrequited labor, to come\r\nand go at the bidding of another. Were not these reflections enough to\r\nincapacitate the Doctor for the time being, for cool thought as to how\r\nhe should best guard against the enemy? Indeed, in view of Slavery and\r\nits horrid features, the wonder is, not that more was not done, but that\r\nany thing was done, that the victims were not driven almost out of their\r\nsenses. But time rolled on until nearly twenty-four hours had passed,\r\nand while reposing their fatigued and weary limbs in bed, just before\r\nday-break, hyena-like the slave-hunters pounced upon all three of them,\r\nand soon had them hand-cuffed and hurried off to a United States'\r\nCommissioner's office. Armed with the Fugitive Law, and a strong guard\r\nof officers to carry it out, resistance would have been simply useless.\r\nEre the morning sun arose the sad news was borne by the telegraph wires\r\nto all parts of the country of this awful calamity on the Underground\r\nRail Road.\r\n\r\nScarcely less painful to the Committee was the news of this accident,\r\nthan the news of a disaster, resulting in the loss of several lives, on\r\nthe Camden and Amboy Road, would have been to its managers. This was the\r\nfirst accident that had ever taken place on the road after passengers\r\nhad reached the Philadelphia Committee, although, in various instances,\r\nslave-hunters had been within a hair's breadth of their prey.\r\n\r\nAll that was reported respecting the arrest and return of the Doctor's\r\nkin, so disgraceful to Christianity and civilization, is taken from the\r\nLiberator, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    THREE FUGITIVE SLAVES ARRESTED IN NEW YORK, AND GIVEN UP TO\r\n    THEIR OWNERS.\r\n\r\n    NEW YORK, May 25th.\r\n\r\n    About three o'clock this morning, three colored men, father and\r\n    two sons, known as Jake, Bob, and Stephen Pennington, were\r\n    arrested at the instance of David Smith and Jacob Grove, of\r\n    Washington Co., Md., who claimed them as their slaves. They were\r\n    taken before Commissioner Morton, of the United States Court,\r\n    and it was understood that they would be examined at 11 o'clock;\r\n    instead of that, however, the case was heard at once, no persons\r\n    being present, when the claimnants testified that they were the\r\n    owners of said slaves and that they escaped from their service\r\n    at Baltimore, on Sunday last.\r\n\r\n    From what we can gather of the proceedings, the fugitives\r\n    acknowledged themselves to be slaves of Smith and Grove. The\r\n    commissioner considering the testimony sufficient, ordered their\r\n    surrender, and they were accordingly given up to their\r\n    claimants, who hurried them off at once, and they are now on\r\n    their way to Baltimore. A telegraph despatch has been sent to\r\n    Philadelphia, as it is understood an attempt will be made to\r\n    rescue the parties, when the cars arrive. There was no\r\n    excitement around the commissioner's office, owing to a\r\n    misunderstanding as to the time of examination. The men were\r\n    traced to this city by the claimants, who made application to\r\n    the United States Court, when officers Horton and De Angeles\r\n    were deputied by the marshal to effect their arrest, and those\r\n    officers, with deputy Marshal Thompson scoured the city, and\r\n    finally found them secreted in a house in Broome St. They were\r\n    brought before Commissioner Morton this morning. No counsel\r\n    appeared for the fugitives. The case being made out, the usual\r\n    affidavits of fear of rescue were made, and the warrants\r\n    thereupon issued, and the three fugitives were delivered over to\r\n    the U.S. Marshal, and hurried off to Maryland. They were a\r\n    father and his two sons, father about forty-five and sons\r\n    eighteen or nineteen. The evidence shows them to have recently\r\n    escaped. The father is the brother of the Rev. Dr. Pennington, a\r\n    highly respected colored preacher of this city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    NEW YORK, May 28.\r\n\r\n    Last evening the church at the corner of Prince and Marion\r\n    streets was filled with an intelligent audience of white and\r\n    colored people, to hear Dr. Pennington relate the circumstance\r\n    connected with the arrest of his brother and nephews. He showed,\r\n    that he attempted to afford his brother the assistance of\r\n    counsel, but was unable to do so, the officers at the Marshal's\r\n    office having deceived him in relation to the time the trial was\r\n    to take place before the Commissioners. Hon. E.F. Culver next\r\n    addressed the audience, showing, that a great injustice had been\r\n    done to the brother of Dr. Pennington, and though he, up to that\r\n    time, had advocated peace, he now had the spirit to tear down\r\n    the building over the Marshal's head. Intense interest was\r\n    manifested during the proceedings, and much sympathy in behalf\r\n    of Dr. Pennington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE FUGITIVE SLAVES IN BALTIMORE.\r\n\r\n    The U.S. Marshal, A.T. Hillyer, Esq., received a dispatch this\r\n    morning from officers Horton and Dellugelis, at Baltimore,\r\n    stating, that they had arrived there with the three slaves,\r\n    arrested here yesterday (the Penningtons), the owners\r\n    accompanying them. The officers will return to New York, this\r\n    evening.--_N.Y. Express_, 27_th_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    NEW YORK, May 30.\r\n\r\n    The Rev. Dr. Pennington has received a letter from Mr. Grove,\r\n    the claimant of his brother, who was recently taken back from\r\n    this city, offering to sell him to Dr. Pennington, should he\r\n    wish to buy him, and stating, that he would await a reply,\r\n    before \"selling him to the slave-drivers.\" Mr. Groce, who\r\n    accompanied his \"sweet heart,\" Matilda, in the same train which\r\n    conveyed the Penningtons to New York, had reason to apprehend\r\n    danger to all the Underground Rail Road passengers, as will\r\n    appear from his subjoined letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n        ELMIRA, May 28th.\r\n\r\n        DEAR LUKE:--I arrived home safe with my precious charge,\r\n        and found all well. I have just learned, that the\r\n        Penningtons are taken. Had he done as I wished him he\r\n        would never have been taken. Last night our tall friend\r\n        from Baltimore came, and caused great excitement here by\r\n        his information. The lady is perfectly safe now in\r\n        Canada. I will write you and Mr. Still as soon as I get\r\n        over the excitement. This letter was first intended for\r\n        Mr. Gains, but I now send it to you. Please let me hear\r\n        their movements.\r\n\r\n        Yours truly,\r\n\r\n        C.L. GROCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut sadly as this blow was felt by the Vigilance Committee, it did not\r\ncause them to relax their efforts in the least. Indeed it only served to\r\nstir them up to renewed diligence and watchfulness, although for a\r\nlength of time afterwards the Committee felt disposed, when sending, to\r\navoid New York as much as possible, and in lieu thereof, to send _viâ_\r\nElmira, where there was a depot under the agency of John W. Jones. Mr.\r\nJones was a true and prompt friend of the fugitive, and wide-awake with\r\nregard to Slavery and slave-holders, and slave hunters, for he had known\r\nfrom sad experience in Virginia every trait of character belonging to\r\nthese classes.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the Doctor's grief, friends of the slave soon raised\r\nmoney to purchase his brother, about $1,000; but the unfortunate sons\r\nwere doomed to the auction block and the far South, where, the writer\r\nhas never exactly learned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"FLEEING GIRL OF FIFTEEN,\" IN MALE ATTIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROFESSORS H. AND T. OFFER THEIR SERVICES--CAPTAINS B. ALSO ARE\r\nENLISTED--SLAVE-TRADER GRASPING TIGHTLY HIS PREY, BUT SHE IS\r\nRESCUED--LONG CONFLICT, BUT GREAT TRIUMPH--ARRIVAL ON THANKSGIVING DAY,\r\nNOV. 25, 1855. It was the business of the Vigilance Committee, as it was\r\nclearly understood by the friends of the Slave, to assist all needy\r\nfugitives, who might in any way manage to reach Philadelphia, but, for\r\nvarious reasons, not to send agents South to incite slaves to run away,\r\nor to assist them in so doing. Sometimes, however, this rule could not\r\naltogether be conformed to. Cases, in some instances, would appeal so\r\nloudly and forcibly to humanity, civilization, and Christianity, that it\r\nwould really seem as if the very stones would cry out, unless something\r\nwas done. As an illustration of this point, the story of the young girl,\r\nwhich is now to be related, will afford the most striking proof. At the\r\nsame time it may be seen how much anxiety, care, hazard, delay and\r\nmaterial aid, were required in order to effect the deliverance of some\r\nwho were in close places, and difficult of access. It will be necessary\r\nto present a considerable amount of correspondence in this case, to\r\nbring to light the hidden mysteries of this narrative. The first letter,\r\nin explanation, is the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM J. BIGELOW, ESQ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    WASHINGTON, D.C., June 27, 1854.\r\n\r\n    MR. WM. STILL--_Dear Sir_:--I have to thank you for the prompt\r\n    answer you had the kindness to give to my note of 22d inst.\r\n    Having found a correspondence so quick and easy, and withal so\r\n    very flattering, I address you again more fully.\r\n\r\n    The liberal appropriation for _transportation_ has been made\r\n    chiefly on account of a female child of ten or eleven years old,\r\n    for whose purchase I have been authorized to offer $700\r\n    (refused), and for whose sister I have paid $1,600, and some\r\n    $1,000 for their mother, &c.\r\n\r\n    This child sleeps in the same apartment with its master and\r\n    mistress, which adds to the difficulty of removal. She is some\r\n    ten or twelve miles from the city, so that really the chief\r\n    hazard will be in bringing her safely to town, and in secreting\r\n    her until a few days of _storm_ shall have abated. All this, I\r\n    think, is now provided for with entire safety.\r\n\r\n    The child has two cousins in the immediate vicinity; a young man\r\n    of some twenty-two years of age, and his sister, of perhaps\r\n    seventeen--_both Slaves_, but bright and clear-headed as\r\n    anybody. The young man I have seen often--the services of _both_\r\n    seem indispensable to the main object suggested; but having once\r\n    rendered the service, they cannot, and ought not return to\r\n    Slavery. They look for _freedom_ as the reward of what they\r\n    shall now do.\r\n\r\n    Out of the $300, cheerfully offered for the whole enterprise, I\r\n    must pay some reasonable sum for transportation to the city and\r\n    sustenance while here. It cannot be much; for the balance, I\r\n    shall give a draft, which will be _promptly paid_ on their\r\n    arrival in New York.\r\n\r\n    If I have been understood to offer the whole $300, _it shall be\r\n    paid_, though I have meant as above stated. Among the various\r\n    ways that have been suggested, has been that of taking _all of\r\n    them_ into the cars here; that, I think, will be found\r\n    impracticable. I find so much vigilance at the depot, that I\r\n    would not deem it safe, though, in any kind of carriage they\r\n    might leave in safety at any time.\r\n\r\n    All the rest I leave to the experience and sagacity of the\r\n    gentleman who maps out the enterprise.\r\n\r\n    Now I will thank you to reply to this and let me know that it\r\n    reaches you in safety, and is not put in a careless place,\r\n    whereby I may be endangered; and state also, whether all my\r\n    propositions are understood and acceptable, and whether, (pretty\r\n    quickly after I shall inform you that _all things are ready_),\r\n    the gentleman will make his appearance?\r\n\r\n    I live alone. My office and bed-room, &c., are at the corner of\r\n    E. and 7th streets, opposite the east end of the General Post\r\n    Office, where any one may call upon me.\r\n\r\n    It would, of course, be imprudent, that this letter, or any\r\n    other _written_ particulars, be in his pockets for fear of\r\n    accident.\r\n\r\n    Yours very respectfully,\r\n\r\n    J. BIGELOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this letter clearly brought to light the situation of things, its\r\nauthor, however, had scarcely begun to conceive of the numberless\r\ndifficulties which stood in the way of success before the work could be\r\naccomplished. The information which Mr. Bigelow's letter contained of\r\nthe painful situation of this young girl was submitted to different\r\nparties who could be trusted, with a view of finding a person who might\r\npossess sufficient courage to undertake to bring her away. Amongst those\r\nconsulted were two or three captains who had on former occasions done\r\ngood service in the cause. One of these captains was known in\r\nUnderground Rail-Road circles as the \"powder boy.\"[A] He was willing to\r\nundertake the work, and immediately concluded to make a visit to\r\nWashington, to see how the \"land lay.\" Accordingly in company with\r\nanother Underground Rail Road captain, he reported himself one day to\r\nMr. Bigelow with as much assurance as if he were on an errand for an\r\noffice under the government. The impression made on Mr. Bigelow's mind\r\nmay be seen from the following letter; it may also be seen that he was\r\nfully alive to the necessity of precautionary measures.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: He had been engaged at different times in carrying powder\r\nin his boat from a powder magazine, and from this circumstance, was\r\nfamiliarly called the \"Powder Boy.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND LETTER FROM LAWYER BIGELOW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    WASHINGTON, D.C., September 9th, 1855.\r\n\r\n    MR. WM. STILL, DEAR SIR:--I strongly hope the little matter of\r\n    business so long pending and about which I have written you so\r\n    many times, will take a move now. I have the promise that the\r\n    merchandize shall be delivered in this city to-night. Like so\r\n    many other promises, this also may prove a failure, though I\r\n    have reason to believe that it will not. I shall, however, know\r\n    before I mail this note. In case the goods arrive here I shall\r\n    hope to see your long-talked of \"Professional gentleman\" in\r\n    Washington, as soon as possible. He will find me by the enclosed\r\n    card, which shall be a satisfactory introduction for him. You\r\n    have never given me his name, nor am I anxious to know it. But\r\n    on a pleasant visit made last fall to friend Wm. Wright, in\r\n    Adams Co., I suppose I accidentally learned it to be a certain\r\n    Dr. H----. Well, let him come.\r\n\r\n    I had an interesting call a week ago from two gentlemen, masters\r\n    of vessels, and brothers, one of whom, I understand, you know as\r\n    the \"powder boy.\" I had a little light freight for them; but not\r\n    finding enough other freight to ballast their craft, they went\r\n    down the river looking for wheat, and promising to return soon.\r\n    I hope to see them often.\r\n\r\n    I hope this may find you returned from your northern trip,[A] as\r\n    your time proposed was out two or three days ago.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote A: Mr. Bigelow's correspondent had been on a visit to\r\n    the fugitives to Canada.]\r\n\r\n    I hope if the whole particulars of Jane Johnson's case[B] are\r\n    printed, you will send me the copy as proposed.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote B: Jane Johnson of the Passmore Williamson Slave\r\n    Case.]\r\n\r\n    I forwarded some of her things to Boston a few days ago, and had\r\n    I known its importance in court, I could have sent you one or\r\n    two witnesses who would prove that her freedom was intended by\r\n    her before she left Washington, and that a man was _engaged_\r\n    here to go on to Philadelphia the same day with her to give\r\n    notice there of her case, though I think he failed to do so. It\r\n    was beyond all question her purpose, _before leaving Washington\r\n    and provable too_, that if Wheeler should make her a free woman\r\n    by taking her to a free state \"_to use it rather_.\"\r\n\r\n    Tuesday, 11th September. The attempt was made on Sunday to\r\n    forward the merchandize, but failed through no fault of any of\r\n    the parties that I now know of. It will be repeated soon, and\r\n    you shall know the result.\r\n\r\n    \"Whorra for Judge Kane.\" I feel so indignant at the man, that it\r\n    is not easy to write the foregoing sentence, and yet who is\r\n    helping our cause like Kane and Douglas, not forgetting\r\n    Stringfellow. I hope soon to know that this reaches you in\r\n    safety.\r\n\r\n    It often happens that light freight would be offered to Captain\r\n    B., but the owners cannot by possibility _advance_ the amount of\r\n    freight. I wish it were possible in some such extreme cases,\r\n    that after advancing _all they have_, some public fund should be\r\n    found to pay the balance or at least lend it.\r\n\r\n    [I wish here to caution you against the supposition that I would\r\n    do any act, or say a word towards helping servants to escape.\r\n    Although I hate slavery so much, I keep my hands clear of any\r\n    such wicked or illegal act.]\r\n\r\n    Yours, very truly,\r\n\r\n    J.B.\r\n\r\n    Will you recollect, hereafter, that in any of my future letters,\r\n    in which I may use [] whatever words may be within the brackets\r\n    are intended to have no signification whatever to you, only to\r\n    blind the eyes of the uninitiated. You will find an example at\r\n    the close of my letter.\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to this time the chances seemed favorable of procuring the ready\r\nservices of either of the above mentioned captains who visited Lawyer\r\nBigelow for the removal of the merchandize to Philadelphia, providing\r\nthe shipping master could have it in readiness to suit their\r\nconvenience. But as these captains had a number of engagements at\r\nRichmond, Petersburg, &c., it was not deemed altogether safe to rely\r\nupon either of them, consequently in order to be prepared in case of an\r\nemergency, the matter was laid before two professional gentlemen who\r\nwere each occupying chairs in one of the medical colleges of\r\nPhiladelphia. They were known to be true friends of the slave, and had\r\npossessed withal some experience in Underground Rail Road matters.\r\nEither of these professors was willing to undertake the operation,\r\nprovided arrangements could be completed in time to be carried out\r\nduring the vacation. In this hopeful, although painfully indefinite\r\nposition the matter remained for more than a year; but the\r\ncorrespondence and anxiety increased, and with them disappointments and\r\ndifficulties multiplied. The hope of Freedom, however, buoyed up the\r\nheart of the young slave girl during the long months of anxious waiting\r\nand daily expectation for the hour of deliverance to come. Equally true\r\nand faithful also did Mr. Bigelow prove to the last; but at times he had\r\nsome painfully dark seasons to encounter, as may be seen from the\r\nsubjoined letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n    WASHINGTON, D.C., October 6th, 1855.\r\n\r\n    MR. STILL, DEAR SIR:--I regret exceedingly to learn by your\r\n    favor of 4th instant, that all things are not ready. Although I\r\n    cannot speak of any immediate and positive danger. [_Yet it is\r\n    well known that the city is full of incendiaries_.]\r\n\r\n    Perhaps you are aware that any colored citizen is liable at any\r\n    hour of day or night without any show of authority to have his\r\n    house ransacked by constables, and if others do it and commit\r\n    the most outrageous depredations none but white witnesses can\r\n    convict them. Such outrages are always common here, and no kind\r\n    of property exposed to colored protection only, can be\r\n    considered safe. [I don't say that _much liberty_ should not be\r\n    given to constables on account of numerous runaways, but it\r\n    don't always work for good.] Before advertising they go round\r\n    and offer rewards to sharp colored men of perhaps _one or two\r\n    hundred dollars_, to betray runaways, and having discovered\r\n    their hiding-place, seize them and then cheat their informers\r\n    out of the money.\r\n\r\n    [_Although a law-abiding man_,] I am anxious in this case of\r\n    _innocence_ to raise no conflict or suspicion. [_Be sure that\r\n    the manumission is full and legal_.] And as I am _powerless_\r\n    without your aid, _I pray you_ don't lose a moment in giving me\r\n    relief. The idea of waiting yet for weeks seems dreadful; do\r\n    reduce it to days if possible, and give me notice of the\r\n    _earliest possible time_.\r\n\r\n    The property is not yet advertised, but will be, [and if we\r\n    delay too long, may be sold and lost.]\r\n\r\n    It was a great misunderstanding, though not your fault, that so\r\n    much delay would be necessary. [I repeat again that I must have\r\n    the thing done legally, therefore, please get a good lawyer to\r\n    draw up the deed of manumission.]\r\n\r\n    Yours Truly,\r\n\r\n    J. BIGELOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat was the anxiety felt in Washington. It is certainly not too much\r\nto say, that an equal amount of anxiety existed in Philadelphia\r\nrespecting the safety of the merchandise. At this juncture Mr. Bigelow\r\nhad come to the conclusion that it was no longer safe to write over his\r\nown name, but that he would do well to henceforth adopt the name of the\r\nrenowned Quaker, Wm. Penn, (he was worthy of it) as in the case of the\r\nfollowing letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WASHINGTON, D.C., November 10th, 1855.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:--Doctor T. presented my card last night about half\r\n    past eight which I instantly recognized. I, however, soon became\r\n    suspicious, and afterwards confounded, to find the doctor using\r\n    your name and the well known names of Mr. McK. and Mr. W. and\r\n    yet, neither he nor I, could conjecture the object of his visit.\r\n\r\n    The doctor is agreeable and sensible, and doubtless a\r\n    true-hearted man. He seemed to see the whole matter as I did,\r\n    and was embarrassed. He had nothing to propose, no information\r\n    to give of the \"P. Boy,\" or of any substitute, and seemed to\r\n    want no particular information from me concerning my anxieties\r\n    and perils, though I stated them to him, but found him as\r\n    powerless as myself to give me relief. I had an agreeable\r\n    interview with the doctor till after ten, when he left,\r\n    intending to take the cars at six, as I suppose he did do, this\r\n    morning.\r\n\r\n    This morning after eight, I got your letter of the 9th, but it\r\n    gives me but little enlightenment or satisfaction. You simply\r\n    say that the doctor is a _true man_, which I cannot doubt, that\r\n    you thought it best we should have an interview, and that you\r\n    supposed I would meet the expenses. You informed me also that\r\n    the \"P. Boy\" left for Richmond, on Friday, the 2d, to be gone\r\n    _the length of time named in your last_, I must infer that to be\r\n    _ten days_ though in your last _you assured me_ that the \"P.\r\n    Boy\" would certainly start for _this place_ (not Richmond) in\r\n    two or three days, though the difficulty about freight might\r\n    cause delay, and the whole enterprise might not be accomplished\r\n    under ten days, &c., &c. That time having elapsed and I having\r\n    agreed to an extra fifty dollars to ensure promptness. I have\r\n    scarcely left my office since, except for my hasty meals,\r\n    awaiting his arrival. You now inform me he has gone to Richmond,\r\n    to be gone ten days, which will expire tomorrow, but you do not\r\n    say he will return here or to Phila, or where, at the expiration\r\n    of that time, and Dr. T. could tell me nothing whatever about\r\n    him. Had he been able to tell me that this _best plan_, which I\r\n    have so long rested upon, would fail, or was abandoned, I could\r\n    then understand it, but he says no such thing, and you say, as\r\n    you have twice before said, \"ten days more.\"\r\n\r\n    Now, my dear sir, after this recapitulation, can you not see\r\n    that I have reason for great embarrassment? I have given\r\n    assurances, both here and in New York, founded on your\r\n    assurances to me, and caused my friends in the latter place\r\n    great anxiety, so much that I have had no way to explain my own\r\n    letters but by sending your last two to Mr. Tappan.\r\n\r\n    I cannot doubt, I do not, but that you wish to help me, and the\r\n    cause too, for which both of us have made many and large\r\n    sacrifices with no hope of reward in this world. If in this case\r\n    I have been very urgent since September Dr. T. can give you some\r\n    of my reasons, they have not been selfish.\r\n\r\n    The whole matter is in a nutshell. Can I, in your opinion,\r\n    depend on the \"P. Boy,\" and when?\r\n\r\n    If he promises to come here next trip, will he come, or go to\r\n    Richmond? This I think is the best way. Can I depend on it?\r\n\r\n    Dr. T. promised to write me some explanation and give some\r\n    advice, and at first I thought to await his letter, but on\r\n    second thought concluded to tell you how I feel, as I have done.\r\n\r\n    Will you answer my questions with some explicitness, and without\r\n    delay?\r\n\r\n    I forgot to inquire of Dr. T. who is the head of your Vigilance\r\n    Committee, whom I may address concerning other and further\r\n    operations?\r\n\r\n    Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n    WM. PENN.\r\n\r\n    P.S. I ought to say, that I have no doubt but there were good\r\n    reasons for the P. Boy's going to Richmond instead of W.; _but\r\n    what can they be_?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst there are a score of other interesting letters, bearing on this\r\ncase, the above must suffice, to give at least, an idea of the\r\nperplexities and dangers attending its early history. Having\r\naccomplished this end, a more encouraging and pleasant phase of the\r\ntransaction may now be introduced. Here the difficulties, at least very\r\nmany of them, vanish, yet in one respect, the danger became most\r\nimminent. The following letter shows that the girl had been successfully\r\nrescued from her master, and that a reward of five hundred dollars had\r\nbeen offered for her.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WASHINGTON, D.C., October 12, 1855.\r\n\r\n    MR. WM. STILL:--AS YOU PICK UP ALL THE NEWS THAT IS STIRRING, I\r\n    CONTRIBUTE A FEW SCRAPS TO YOUR STOCK, GOING TO SHOW THAT THE\r\n    POOR SLAVE-HOLDERS HAVE THEIR TROUBLES AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n    FOUR HEAVY LOSSES ON ONE SMALL SCRAP CUT FROM A SINGLE NUMBER OF\r\n    THE \"SUN!\" HOW VEXATIOUS! HOW PROVOKING! ON THE OTHER HAND,\r\n    THINK OF THE POOR, TIMID, BREATHLESS, FLYING CHILD OF FIFTEEN!\r\n    FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD! OH, FOR SUCCOR! TO WHOM IN ALL THIS\r\n    WIDE LAND OF FREEDOM SHALL SHE FLEE AND FIND SAFETY?\r\n    ALAS!--ALAS!--THE LAW POINTS TO NO ONE!\r\n\r\n    IS SHE STILL RUNNING WITH BLEEDING FEET?[A] OR HIDES SHE IN SOME\r\n    COLD CAVE, TO REST AND STARVE? \"$500 REWARD.\" YOURS, FOR THE\r\n    WEAK AND THE POOR. PERISH THE REWARD.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote A: At the time this letter was written, she was then\r\n    under Mr. B.'s protection in Washington, and had to be so kept\r\n    for six weeks. His question, therefore, \"is she still running\r\n    with bleeding feet,\" etc., was simply a precautionary step to\r\n    blind any who might perchance investigate the matter.]\r\n\r\n    J.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus succeeded in getting possession of, and secreting this\r\nfleeing child of fifteen, as best they could, in Washington, all\r\nconcerned were compelled to \"possess their souls in patience,\" until the\r\nstorm had passed. Meanwhile, the \"child of fifteen\" was christened \"Joe\r\nWright,\" and dressed in male attire to prepare for traveling as a lad.\r\nAs no opportunity had hitherto presented itself, whereby to prepare the\r\n\"package\" for shipment, from Washington, neither the \"powder boy\" nor\r\nDr. T.[B] was prepared to attend to the removal, at this critical\r\nmoment. The emergency of the case, however, cried loudly for aid. The\r\nother professional gentleman (Dr. H.), was now appealed to, but his\r\nengagements in the college forbade his absence before about Thanksgiving\r\nday, which was then six weeks off. This fact was communicated to\r\nWashington, and it being the only resource left, the time named was\r\nnecessarily acquiesced in. In the interim, \"Joe\" was to perfect herself\r\nin the art of wearing pantaloons, and all other male rig. Soon the days\r\nand weeks slid by, although at first the time for waiting seemed long,\r\nwhen, according to promise, Dr. H. was in Washington, with his horse and\r\nbuggy prepared for duty. The impressions made by Dr. H., on William\r\nPenn's mind, at his first interview, will doubtless be interesting to\r\nall concerned, as may be seen in the following letter:\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: Dr. T. was one of the professional gentlemen alluded to\r\nabove, who had expressed a willingness to act as an agent in the\r\nmatter.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    WASHINGTON, D.C., November 26, 1855.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SIR:--A recent letter from my friend, probably has led\r\n    you to expect this from me. He was delighted to receive yours of\r\n    the 23d, stating that the boy was _all right_. He found the\r\n    \"Prof. gentleman\" a _perfect gentleman_; cool, quiet,\r\n    thoughtful, and _perfectly competent to execute his\r\n    undertaking_. At the first three minutes of their interview, he\r\n    felt assured that all would be right. He, and all concerned,\r\n    give you and that gentleman sincere thanks for what you have\r\n    done. May the blessings of Him, who cares for the poor, be on\r\n    your heads.\r\n\r\n    The especial object of this, is to inform you that there is a\r\n    half dozen or so of packages here, _pressing for\r\n    transportation_; twice or thrice that number are also pressing,\r\n    but less so than the others. Their aggregate means will average,\r\n    say, $10 each; besides these, we know of a few, say three or\r\n    four, _able and smart_, but utterly destitute, and kept so\r\n    purposely by their oppressors. For all these, we feel deeply\r\n    interested; $10 each would not be enough for the \"powder boy.\"\r\n    Is there any fund from which a pittance could be spared to help\r\n    these poor creatures? I don't doubt but that they would honestly\r\n    repay a small loan as soon as they could earn it. I know full\r\n    well, that if you begin with such cases, there is no boundary at\r\n    which you can stop. For years, one half at least, of my friend's\r\n    time here has been gratuitously given to cases of distress among\r\n    this class. He never expects or desires to do less; he literally\r\n    has the _poor always with him_. He knows that it is so with you\r\n    also, therefore, he only states the case, being especially\r\n    anxious for at least those to whom I have referred.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MARIA WEEMS ESCAPING IN MALE ATTIRE]\r\n\r\n    I think a small lot of hard coal might always be sold here _from\r\n    the vessel_ at a profit. Would not a like lot of Cumberland coal\r\n    always sell in Philadelphia?\r\n\r\n    My friend would be very glad to see the powder boy here again,\r\n    and if he brings coal, there are those here, who would try to\r\n    help him sell.\r\n\r\n    Reply to your regular correspondent as usual.\r\n\r\n    WM. PENN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the presence of the Dr., confidence having been reassured that all\r\nwould be right, as well as by the \"inner light,\" William Penn\r\nexperienced a great sense of relief. Everything having been duly\r\narranged, the doctor's horse and carriage stood waiting before the White\r\nHouse (William Penn preferred this place as a starting point, rather\r\nthan before his own office door). It being understood that \"Joe\" was to\r\nact as coachman in passing out of Washington, at this moment he was\r\ncalled for, and in the most polite and natural manner, with the\r\nfleetness of a young deer, he jumped into the carriage, took the reins\r\nand whip, whilst the doctor and William Penn were cordially shaking\r\nhands and bidding adieu. This done, the order was given to Joe, \"drive\r\non.\" Joe bravely obeyed. The faithful horse trotted off willingly, and\r\nthe doctor sat in his carriage as composed as though he had succeeded in\r\nprocuring an honorable and lucrative office from the White House, and\r\nwas returning home to tell his wife the good news. The doctor had some\r\nknowledge of the roads, also some acquaintances in Maryland, through\r\nwhich State he had to travel; therefore, after leaving the suburbs of\r\nWashington, the doctor took the reins in his own hands, as he felt that\r\nhe was more experienced as a driver than his young coachman. He was also\r\nmindful of the fact, that, before reaching Pennsylvania, his faithful\r\nbeast would need feeding several times, and that they consequently would\r\nbe obliged to pass one or two nights at least in Maryland, either at a\r\ntavern or farm-house.\r\n\r\nIn reflecting upon the matter, it occurred to the doctor, that in\r\nearlier days, he had been quite intimately acquainted with a farmer and\r\nhis family (who were slave-holders), in Maryland, and that he would\r\nabout reach their house at the end of the first day's journey. He\r\nconcluded that he could do no better than to renew his acquaintance with\r\nhis old friends on this occasion. After a very successful day's travel,\r\nnight came on, and the doctor was safely at the farmer's door with his\r\ncarriage and waiter boy; the doctor was readily recognized by the farmer\r\nand his family, who seemed glad to see him; indeed, they made quite a\r\n\"fuss\" over him. As a matter of strategy, the doctor made quite a \"fuss\"\r\nover them in return; nevertheless, he did not fail to assume airs of\r\nimportance, which were calculated to lead them to think that he had\r\ngrown older and wiser than when they knew him in his younger days. In\r\ncasually referring to the manner of his traveling, he alluded to the\r\nfact, that he was not very well, and as it had been a considerable\r\nlength of time since he had been through that part of the country, he\r\nthought that the drive would do him good, and especially the sight of\r\nold familiar places and people. The farmer and his family felt\r\nthemselves exceedingly honored by the visit from the distinguished\r\ndoctor, and manifested a marked willingness to spare no pains to render\r\nhis night's lodging in every way comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe Dr. being an educated and intelligent gentleman, well posted on\r\nother questions besides medicine, could freely talk about farming in all\r\nits branches, and \"niggers\" too, in an emergency, so the evening passed\r\noff pleasantly with the Dr. in the parlor, and \"Joe\" in the kitchen. The\r\nDr., however, had given \"Joe\" precept upon precept, \"here a little, and\r\nthere a little,\" as to how he should act in the presence of master white\r\npeople, or slave colored people, and thus he was prepared to act his\r\npart with due exactness. Before the evening grew late, the Dr., fearing\r\nsome accident, intimated, that he was feeling a \"little languid,\" and\r\ntherefore thought that he had better \"retire.\" Furthermore he added,\r\nthat he was \"liable to vertigo,\" when not quite well, and for this\r\nreason he must have his boy \"Joe\" sleep in the room with him. \"Simply\r\ngive him a bed quilt and he will fare well enough in one corner of the\r\nroom,\" said the Dr. The proposal was readily acceded to, and carried\r\ninto effect by the accommodating host. The Dr. was soon in bed, sleeping\r\nsoundly, and \"Joe,\" in his new coat and pants, wrapped up in the bed\r\nquilt, in a corner of the room quite comfortably.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the Dr. arose at as early an hour as was prudent for a\r\ngentleman of his position, and feeling refreshed, partook of a good\r\nbreakfast, and was ready, with his boy, \"Joe,\" to prosecute their\r\njourney. Face, eyes, hope, and steps, were set as flint,\r\nPennsylvania-ward. What time the following day or night they crossed\r\nMason and Dixon's line is not recorded on the Underground Rail Road\r\nbooks, but at four o'clock on Thanksgiving Day, the Dr. safely landed\r\nthe \"fleeing girl of fifteen\" at the residence of the writer in\r\nPhiladelphia. On delivering up his charge, the Dr. simply remarked to\r\nthe writer's wife, \"I wish to leave this young lad with you a short\r\nwhile, and I will call and see further about him.\" Without further\r\nexplanation, he stepped into his carriage and hurried away, evidently\r\nanxious to report himself to his wife, in order to relieve her mind of a\r\ngreat weight of anxiety on his account. The writer, who happened to be\r\nabsent from home when the Dr. called, returned soon afterwards. \"The Dr.\r\nhas been here\" (he was the family physician), \"and left this 'young\r\nlad,' and said, that he would call again and see about him,\" said Mrs.\r\nS. The \"young lad\" was sitting quite composedly in the dining-room, with\r\nhis cap on. The writer turned to him and inquired, \"I suppose you are\r\nthe person that the Dr. went to Washington after, are you not?\" \"No,\"\r\nsaid \"Joe.\" \"Where are you from then?\" was the next question. \"From\r\nYork, sir.\" \"From York? Why then did the Dr. bring you here?\" was the\r\nnext query, \"the Dr. went expressly to Washington after a young girl,\r\nwho was to be brought away dressed up as a boy, and I took you to be the\r\nperson.\" Without replying \"the lad\" arose and walked out of the house.\r\nThe querist, somewhat mystified, followed him, and then when the two\r\nwere alone, \"the lad\" said, \"I am the one the Dr. went after.\" After\r\ncongratulating her, the writer asked why she had said, that she was not\r\nfrom Washington, but from York. She explained, that the Dr. had strictly\r\ncharged her not to own to any person, except the writer, that she was\r\nfrom Washington, but from York. As there were persons present (wife,\r\nhired girl, and a fugitive woman), when the questions were put to her,\r\nshe felt that it would be a violation of her pledge to answer in the\r\naffirmative. Before this examination, neither of the individuals present\r\nfor a moment entertained the slightest doubt but that she was a \"lad,\"\r\nso well had she acted her part in every particular. She was dressed in a\r\nnew suit, which fitted her quite nicely, and with her unusual amount of\r\ncommon sense, she appeared to be in no respect lacking. To send off a\r\nprize so rare and remarkable, as she was, without affording some of the\r\nstockholders and managers of the Road the pleasure of seeing her, was\r\nnot to be thought of. In addition to the Vigilance Committee, quite a\r\nnumber of persons were invited to see her, and were greatly astonished.\r\nIndeed it was difficult to realize, that she was not a boy, even after\r\nbecoming acquainted with the facts in the case.\r\n\r\nThe following is an exact account of this case, as taken from the\r\nUnderground Rail Road records:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"THANKSGIVING DAY, Nov., 1855.\r\n\r\n    Arrived, Ann Maria Weems, _alias_ 'Joe Wright,' _alias_ 'Ellen\r\n    Capron,' from Washington, through the aid of Dr. H. She is about\r\n    fifteen years of age, bright mulatto, well grown, smart and\r\n    good-looking. For the last three years, or about that length of\r\n    time, she has been owned by Charles M. Price, a negro trader, of\r\n    Rockville, Maryland. Mr. P. was given to 'intemperance,' to a\r\n    very great extent, and gross 'profanity.' He buys and sells many\r\n    slaves in the course of the year. 'His wife is cross and\r\n    peevish.' She used to take great pleasure in 'torturing' one\r\n    'little slave boy.' He was the son of his master (and was owned\r\n    by him); this was the chief cause of the mistress' spite.\"\r\n\r\n    Ann Maria had always desired her freedom from childhood, and\r\n    although not thirteen, when first advised to escape, she\r\n    received the suggestion without hesitation, and ever after that\r\n    time waited almost daily, for more than two years, the chance to\r\n    flee. Her friends were, of course, to aid her, and make\r\n    arrangements for her escape. Her owner, fearing that she might\r\n    escape, for a long time compelled her to sleep in the chamber\r\n    with \"her master and mistress;\" indeed she was so kept until\r\n    about three weeks before she fled. She left her parents living\r\n    in Washington. Three of her brothers had been sold South from\r\n    their parents. Her mother had been purchased for $1,000, and one\r\n    of her sisters for $1,600 for freedom. Before Ann Maria was\r\n    thirteen years of age $700 was offered for her by a friend, who\r\n    desired to procure her freedom, but the offer was promptly\r\n    refused, as were succeeding ones repeatedly made. The only\r\n    chance of procuring her freedom, depended upon getting her away\r\n    on the Underground Rail Road. She was neatly attired in male\r\n    habiliments, and in that manner came all the way from\r\n    Washington. After passing two or three days with her new friends\r\n    in Philadelphia, she was sent on (in male attire) to Lewis\r\n    Tappan, of New York, who had likewise been deeply interested in\r\n    her case from the beginning, and who held himself ready, as was\r\n    understood, to cash a draft for three hundred dollars to\r\n    compensate the man who might risk his own liberty in bringing\r\n    her on from Washington. After having arrived safely in New York,\r\n    she found a home and kind friends in the family of the Rev. A.N.\r\n    Freeman, and received quite an ovation characteristic of an\r\n    Underground Rail Road.\r\n\r\n    After having received many tokens of esteem and kindness from\r\n    the friends of the slave in New York and Brooklyn, she was\r\n    carefully forwarded on to Canada, to be educated at the \"Buxton\r\n    Settlement.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAn interesting letter, however, from the mother of Ann Maria, conveying\r\nthe intelligence of her late great struggle and anxiety in laboring to\r\nfree her last child from Slavery is too important to be omitted, and\r\nhence is inserted in connection with this narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM THE MOTHER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    WASHINGTON, D.C., September 19th, 1857.\r\n\r\n    WM. STILL, ESQ., Philadelphia, Pa. SIR:--I have just sent for my\r\n    son Augustus, in Alabama. I have sent eleven hundred dollars\r\n    which pays for his body and some thirty dollars to pay his fare\r\n    to Washington. I borrowed one hundred and eighty dollars to make\r\n    out the eleven hundred dollars. I was not very successful in\r\n    Syracuse. I collected only twelve dollars, and in Rochester only\r\n    two dollars. I did not know that the season was so unpropitious.\r\n    The wealthy had all gone to the springs. They must have returned\r\n    by this time. I hope you will exert yourself and help me get a\r\n    part of the money I owe, at least. I am obliged to pay it by the\r\n    12th of next month. I was unwell when I returned through\r\n    Philadelphia, or I should have called. I had been from home five\r\n    weeks.\r\n\r\n    My son Augustus is the last of the family in Slavery. I feel\r\n    rejoiced that he is soon to be free and with me, and of course\r\n    feel the greatest solicitude about raising the one hundred and\r\n    eighty dollars I have borrowed of a kind friend, or who has\r\n    borrowed it for me at bank. I hope and pray you will help me as\r\n    far as possible. Tell Mr. Douglass to remember me, and if he\r\n    can, to interest his friends for me.\r\n\r\n    You will recollect that five hundred dollars of our money was\r\n    taken to buy the sister of Henry H. Garnett's wife. Had I been\r\n    able to command this I should not be necessitated to ask the\r\n    favors and indulgences I do.\r\n\r\n    I am expecting daily the return of Augustus, and may Heaven\r\n    grant him a safe deliverance and smile propitiously upon you and\r\n    all kind friends who have aided in his return to me.\r\n\r\n    Be pleased to remember me to friends, and accept yourself the\r\n    blessing and prayers of your dear friend,\r\n\r\n    EARRO WEEMS.\r\n\r\n    P.S. Direct your letter to E.L. Stevens, in Duff Green's Row,\r\n    Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n    E.W.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat William Penn who worked so faithfully for two years for the\r\ndeliverance of Ann Maria may not appear to have been devoting all his\r\ntime and sympathy towards this single object it seems expedient that two\r\nor three additional letters, proposing certain grand Underground Rail\r\nRoad plans, should have a place here. For this purpose, therefore, the\r\nfollowing letters are subjoined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS FROM WILLIAM PENN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    WASHINGTON, D.C., Oct. 3, 1854\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:--I address you to-day chiefly at the suggestion of the\r\n    Lady who will hand you my letter, and who is a resident of your\r\n    city.\r\n\r\n    After stating to you, that the case about which I have\r\n    previously written, remains just as it was when I wrote\r\n    last--full of difficulty--I thought I would call your attention\r\n    to another enterprise; it is this: to find a man with a large\r\n    heart for doing good to the oppressed, who will come to\r\n    Washington to live, and who will _walk out to Penn'a., or a part\r\n    of the way there, once or twice a week_. He will find parties\r\n    who will _pay him for doing so_. Parties of say, two, three,\r\n    five or so, who will pay him _at least_ $5 each, for the\r\n    privilege of following him, but _will never speak to him_; but\r\n    will keep just in sight of him and obey any sign he may give;\r\n    say, he takes off his hat and scratches his head as a sign for\r\n    them to go to some barn or wood to rest, &c. No living being\r\n    shall be found to say he ever spoke to them. A white man would\r\n    be best, and then even parties led out by him could not, if they\r\n    would, testify to any _understanding_ or anything else against a\r\n    white man. I think he might make a good living at it. Can it not\r\n    be done?\r\n\r\n    If one or two safe stopping-places could be found on the\r\n    way--such as a barn or shed, they could walk quite safely all\r\n    night and then sleep all day--about two, or _easily_ three\r\n    nights would convey them to a place of safety. The traveler\r\n    might be a peddler or huckster, with an old horse and cart, and\r\n    bring us in eggs and butter if he pleases.\r\n\r\n    Let him once plan out his route, and he might then take ten or a\r\n    dozen at a time, and they are often able and willing to pay $10\r\n    a piece.\r\n\r\n    I have a hard case now on hand; a brother and sister 23 to 25\r\n    years old, whose mother lives in your city. They are cruelly\r\n    treated; they want to go, they _ought_ to go; but they are\r\n    utterly destitute. Can nothing be done for such cases? If you\r\n    can think of anything let me know it. I suppose you know me?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    WASHINGTON, D.C., April 3, 1856.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:--I sent you the recent law of Virginia, under which\r\n    all vessels are to be searched for fugitives within the waters\r\n    of that State.\r\n\r\n    It was long ago suggested by a sagacious friend, that the\r\n    \"powder boy\" might find a better port in the Chesapeake bay, or\r\n    in the Patuxent river to communicate with this vicinity, than by\r\n    entering the Potomac river, even were there no such law.\r\n\r\n    Suppose he opens a trade with some place south-west of\r\n    Annapolis, 25 or 30 miles from here, or less. He might carry\r\n    wood, oysters, &c., and all his customers from this vicinity\r\n    might travel in _that direction_ without any of the suspicions\r\n    that might attend their journeyings _towards this city_. In this\r\n    way, doubtless, a good business might be carried on without\r\n    interruption or competition, and provided the plan was conducted\r\n    without affecting the inhabitants along that shore, no suspicion\r\n    would arise as to the manner or magnitude of his business\r\n    operations. How does this strike you? What does the \"powder boy\"\r\n    think of it?\r\n\r\n    I heretofore intimated a _pressing necessity_ on the part of\r\n    several females--they are variously situated--two have children,\r\n    say a couple each; some have none--of the latter, one can raise\r\n    $50, another, say 30 or 40 dollars--another who was gazetted\r\n    last August (a copy sent you), can raise, through her friends,\r\n    20 or 30 dollars, &c., &c. None of these can walk so far or so\r\n    fast as scores of _men_ that are constantly leaving. I cannot\r\n    shake off my anxiety for these poor creatures. Can you think of\r\n    anything for any of these? Address your other correspondent in\r\n    answer to this at your leisure.\r\n\r\n    Yours,\r\n\r\n    WM. PENN.\r\n\r\n    P.S.--April 3d. Since writing the above, I have received yours\r\n    of 31st. I am rejoiced to hear that business is so successful\r\n    and prosperous--may it continue till _the article_ shall cease\r\n    to be merchandize.\r\n\r\n    I spoke in my last letter of the departure of a \"few friends.\" I\r\n    have since heard of their good health in Penn'a. Probably you\r\n    may have seen them.\r\n\r\n    In reference to the expedition of which you think you can \"hold\r\n    out some little encouragement,\" I will barely remark, that I\r\n    shall be glad, if it is undertaken, to have all the notice of\r\n    the _time and manner_ that is possible, so as to make ready.\r\n\r\n    A friend of mine says, anthracite coal will always pay here from\r\n    Philadelphia, and thinks a small vessel might run often--that\r\n    she never would be searched in the Potomac, unless she went\r\n    outside.\r\n\r\n    You advise caution towards Mr. P. I am precisely of your opinion\r\n    about him, that he is a \"queer stick,\" and while I advised him\r\n    carefully in reference to his own undertakings, I took no\r\n    counsel of him concerning mine.\r\n\r\n    Yours,\r\n\r\n    W.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    WASHINGTON, D.C., April 23d, 1856.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:--I have to thank you for your last two encouraging\r\n    letters of 31st of March and 7th April. I have seen nothing in\r\n    the papers to interest you, and having bad health and a press of\r\n    other engagements, I have neglected to write you.\r\n\r\n    Enclosed is a list of persons referred to in my last letter, all\r\n    most anxious to travel--all meritorious. In some of these I feel\r\n    an especial interest for what they have done to help others in\r\n    distress.\r\n\r\n    I suggest for yours and the \"powder boy's\" consideration the\r\n    following plan: that he shall take in coal for Washington and\r\n    come directly here--sell his coal and go to Georgetown for\r\n    freight, and _wait_ for it. If any fancy articles are sent on\r\n    board, _I understand he has a place_ to put them in, and _if he\r\n    has_ I suggest that he lies still, still waiting for freight\r\n    till the first anxiety is over. Vessels that have _just left_\r\n    are the ones that will be inquired after, and perhaps chased. If\r\n    he lays still a day or two all suspicion will be prevented. If\r\n    there shall be occasion to refer to any of them hereafter, it\r\n    may be by their numbers in the list.\r\n\r\n    The family--5 to 11--will be missed and inquired after soon and\r\n    urgently; 12 and 13 will also be soon missed, but _none of the\r\n    others_.\r\n\r\n    If all this can be done, some little time or notice must be had\r\n    to get them all ready. They tell me they can pay the sums marked\r\n    to their names. The aggregate is small, but as I told you, they\r\n    are poor. Let me hear from you when convenient.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: JOHN HENRY HILL]\r\n\r\n    Truly Yours,\r\n\r\n    WM.

IN ALL FIVE YEARS AND ONE MONTH.\r\n\r\nMany letters from JOHN HENRY show how incessantly his mind ran out\r\ntowards the oppressed, and the remarkable intelligence and ability he\r\ndisplayed with the pen, considering that he had no chance to acquire\r\nbook knowledge. After having fled for refuge to Canada and having become\r\na partaker of impartial freedom under the government of Great Britain,\r\nto many it seemed that the fugitive should be perfectly satisfied. Many\r\nappeared to think that the fugitive, having secured freedom, had but\r\nlittle occasion for anxiety or care, even for his nearest kin. \"Change\r\nyour name.\" \"Never tell any one how you escaped.\" \"Never let any one\r\nknow where you came from.\" \"Never think of writing back, not even to\r\nyour wife; you can do your kin no good, but may do them harm by\r\nwriting.\" \"Take care of yourself.\" \"You are free, well, be satisfied\r\nthen.\" \"It will do you no good to fret about your wife and children;\r\nthat will not get them out of Slavery.\" Such was the advice often given\r\nto the fugitive. Men who had been slaves themselves, and some who had\r\naided in the escape of individuals, sometimes urged these sentiments on\r\nmen and women whose hearts were almost breaking over the thought that\r\ntheir dearest and best friends were in chains in the prison-house.\r\nPerhaps it was thoughtlessness on the part of some, and a wish to\r\ninspire due cautiousness on the part of others, that prompted this\r\nadvice. Doubtless some did soon forget their friends. They saw no way by\r\nwhich they could readily communicate with them. Perhaps Slavery had\r\ndealt with them so cruelly, that little hope or aspiration was left in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, one of the most gratifying facts connected with the\r\nfugitives, the strong love and attachment that they constantly expressed\r\nfor their relatives left in the South; the undying faith they had in God\r\nas evinced by their touching appeals on behalf of their fellow-slaves.\r\nBut few probably are aware how deeply these feelings were cherished in\r\nthe breasts of this people. Forty, fifty, or sixty years, in some\r\ninstances elapsed, but this ardent sympathy and love continued warm and\r\nunwavering as ever. Children left to the cruel mercy of slave-holders,\r\ncould never be forgotten. Brothers and sisters could not refrain from\r\nweeping over the remembrance of their separation on the auction block:\r\nof having seen innocent children, feeble and defenceless women in the\r\ngrasp of a merciless tyrant, pleading, groaning, and crying in vain for\r\npity. Not to remember those thus bruised and mangled, it would seem\r\nalike unnatural, and impossible. Therefore it is a source of great\r\nsatisfaction to be able, in relating these heroic escapes, to present\r\nthe evidences of the strong affections of this greatly oppressed race.\r\n\r\nJOHN HENRY never forgot those with whom he had been a fellow-sufferer in\r\nSlavery; he was always fully awake to their wrongs, and longed to be\r\ndoing something to aid and encourage such as were striving to get their\r\nFreedom. He wrote many letters in behalf of others, as well as for\r\nhimself, the tone of which, was always marked by the most zealous\r\ndevotion to the slave, a high sense of the value of Freedom, and\r\nunshaken confidence that God was on the side of the oppressed, and a\r\nstrong hope, that the day was not far distant, when the slave power\r\nwould be \"suddenly broken and that without remedy.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the literary imperfections of these letters, they are\r\ndeemed well suited to these pages. Of course, slaves were not allowed\r\nbook learning. Virginia even imprisoned white women for teaching free\r\ncolored children the alphabet. Who has forgotten the imprisonment of\r\nMrs. Douglass for this offense? In view of these facts, no apology is\r\nneeded on account of Hill's grammar and spelling.\r\n\r\nIn these letters, may be seen, how much liberty was valued, how the\r\ntaste of Freedom moved the pen of the slave; how the thought of\r\nfellow-bondmen, under the heel of the slave-holder, aroused the spirit\r\nof indignation and wrath; how importunately appeals were made for help\r\nfrom man and from God; how much joy was felt at the arrival of a\r\nfugitive, and the intense sadness experienced over the news of a failure\r\nor capture of a slave. Not only are the feelings of John Henry Hill\r\nrepresented in these epistles, but the feelings of very many others\r\namongst the intelligent fugitives all over the country are also\r\nrepresented to the letter. It is more with a view of doing justice to a\r\nbrave, intelligent class, whom the public are ignorant of, than merely\r\nto give special prominence to John and his relatives as individuals,\r\nthat these letters are given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESCAPE OF JOHN HENRY HILL FROM THE SLAVE AUCTION IN RICHMOND, ON THE\r\nFIRST DAY OF JANUARY, 1853.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN HENRY at that time, was a little turned of twenty-five years of\r\nage, full six feet high, and remarkably well proportioned in every\r\nrespect. He was rather of a brown color, with marked intellectual\r\nfeatures. John was by trade, a carpenter, and was considered a competent\r\nworkman. The year previous to his escape, he hired his time, for which\r\nhe paid his owner $150. This amount John had fully settled up the last\r\nday of the year. As he was a young man of steady habits, a husband and\r\nfather, and withal an ardent lover of Liberty; his owner, John Mitchell,\r\nevidently observed these traits in his character, and concluded that he\r\nwas a dangerous piece of property to keep; that his worth in money could\r\nbe more easily managed than the man. Consequently, his master\r\nunceremoniously, without intimating in any way to John, that he was to\r\nbe sold, took him to Richmond, on the first day of January (the great\r\nannual sale day), and directly to the slave-auction. Just as John was\r\nbeing taken into the building, he was invited to submit to hand-cuffs.\r\nAs the thought flashed upon his mind that he was about to be sold on the\r\nauction-block, he grew terribly desperate. \"Liberty or death\" was the\r\nwatchword of that awful moment. In the twinkling of an eye, he turned on\r\nhis enemies, with his fist, knife, and feet, so tiger-like, that he\r\nactually put four or five men to flight, his master among the number.\r\nHis enemies thus suddenly baffled, John wheeled, and, as if assisted by\r\nan angel, strange as it may appear, was soon out of sight of his\r\npursuers, and securely hid away. This was the last hour of John Henry's\r\nslave life, but not, however, of his struggles and sufferings for\r\nfreedom, for before a final chance to escape presented itself, nine\r\nmonths elapsed. The mystery as to where, and how he fared, the following\r\naccount, in his own words, must explain--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Nine months I was trying to get away. I was secreted for a long\r\n    time in a kitchen of a merchant near the corner of Franklyn and\r\n    7th streets, at Richmond, where I was well taken care of, by a\r\n    lady friend of my mother. When I got Tired of staying in that\r\n    place, I wrote myself a pass to pass myself to Petersburg, here\r\n    I stopped with a very prominent Colored person, who was a friend\r\n    to Freedom stayed here until two white friends told other\r\n    friends if I was in the city to tell me to go at once, and stand\r\n    not upon the order of going, because they had hard a plot. I\r\n    wrot a pass, started for Richmond, Reached Manchester, got off\r\n    the Cars walked into Richmond, once more got back into the same\r\n    old Den, Stayed here from the 16th of Aug. to 12th Sept. On the\r\n    11th of Sept. 8 o'clock P.M. a message came to me that there had\r\n    been a State Room taken on the steamer City of Richmond for my\r\n    benefit, and I assured the party that it would be occupied if\r\n    God be willing. Before 10 o'clock the next morning, on the 12th,\r\n    a beautiful Sept. day, I arose early, wrote my pass for Norfolk\r\n    left my old Den with a many a good bye, turned out the back way\r\n    to 7th St., thence to Main, down Main behind 4 night waich to\r\n    old Rockett's and after about 20 minutes of delay I succeed in\r\n    Reaching the State Room. My Conductor was very much Excited, but\r\n    I felt as Composed as I do at this moment, for I had started\r\n    from my Den that morning for Liberty or for Death providing\r\n    myself with a Brace of Pistels.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly\r\n\r\n    J.H. HILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nA private berth was procured for him on the steamship City of Richmond,\r\nfor the amount of $125, and thus he was brought on safely to\r\nPhiladelphia. While in the city, he enjoyed the hospitalities of the\r\nVigilance Committee, and the greetings of a number of friends, during\r\nthe several days of his sojourn. The thought of his wife, and two\r\nchildren, left in Petersburg, however, naturally caused him much\r\nanxiety. Fortunately, they were free, therefore, he was not without hope\r\nof getting them; moreover, his wife's father (Jack McCraey), was a free\r\nman, well known, and very well to do in the world, and would not be\r\nlikely to see his daughter and grandchildren suffer. In this particular,\r\nHill's lot was of a favorable character, compared with that of most\r\nslaves leaving their wives and children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST LETTER\r\n\r\n\r\nON ARRIVING IN CANADA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    TORONTO, October 4th, 1853.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:--I take this method of informing you that I am well,\r\n    and that I got to this city all safe and sound, though I did not\r\n    get here as soon as I expect.

HILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Canada is highly praised_--_The Vigilance Committee is implored to send\r\nall the Fugitives there_--\"_Farmers and Mechanics wanted_\"--\"_No living\r\nin Canada for Negroes,\" as argued by_ \"_Masters,\" flatly denied, &c.,\r\n&c., &c._\r\n\r\n\r\n    So I ask you to send the fugitives to Canada. I don't know much\r\n    of this Province but I beleaves that there is Rome enough for\r\n    the colored and whites of the United States. We wants farmers\r\n    mechanic men of all qualification &c., if they are not made we\r\n    will make them, if we cannot make the old, we will make our\r\n    children.\r\n\r\n    Now concerning the city toronto this city is Beautiful and\r\n    Prosperous Levele city. Great many wooden codages more than what\r\n    should be but I am in hopes there will be more of the Brick and\r\n    Stonn. But I am not done about your Republicanism. Our masters\r\n    have told us that there was no living in Canada for a Negro but\r\n    if it may Please your gentlemanship to publish these facts that\r\n    we are here able to earn our bread and money enough to make us\r\n    comftable. But I say give me freedom, and the United States may\r\n    have all her money and her Luxtures, yeas give Liberty or Death.\r\n    I'm in America, but not under Such a Government that I cannot\r\n    express myself, speak, think or write So as I am able, and if my\r\n    master had allowed me to have an education I would make them\r\n    American Slave-holders feel me, Yeas I would make them tremble\r\n    when I spoke, and when I take my Pen in hand their knees smote\r\n    together. My Dear Sir suppose I was an educated man. I could\r\n    write you something worth reading, but you know we poor\r\n    fugitives whom has just come over from the South are not able to\r\n    write much on no subject whatever, but I hope by the aid of my\r\n    God I will try to use my midnight lamp, untel I can have some\r\n    influence upon the American Slavery. If some one would say to\r\n    me, that they would give my wife bread untel I could be Educated\r\n    I would stoop my trade this day and take up my books.\r\n\r\n    But a crisis is approaching when assential requisite to the\r\n    American Slaveholders when blood Death or Liberty will be\r\n    required at their hands. I think our people have depened too\r\n    long and too much on false legislator let us now look for\r\n    ourselves. It is true that England however the Englishman is our\r\n    best friend but we as men ought not to depened upon her\r\n    Remonstrace with the Americans because she loves her commercial\r\n    trade as any Nations do. But I must say, while we look up and\r\n    acknowledge the Power greatness and honor of old England, and\r\n    believe that while we sit beneath the Silken folds of her flag\r\n    of Perfect Liberty, we are secure, beyond the reach of the\r\n    aggressions of the Blood hounds and free from the despotism that\r\n    would wrap around our limbs by the damable Slaveholder. Yet we\r\n    would not like spoiled childeren depend upon her, but upon\r\n    ourselves and as one means of strengthening ourselves, we should\r\n    agitate the emigration to Canada. I here send you a paragraph\r\n    which I clipted from the weekly Glob. I hope you will publish so\r\n    that Mr. Williamson may know that men are not chattel here but\r\n    reather they are men and if he wants his chattle let him come\r\n    here after it or his thing. I wants you to let the whole United\r\n    States know we are satisfied here because I have seen more\r\n    Pleasure since I came here then I saw in the U.S. the 24 years\r\n    that I served my master. Come Poor distress men women and come\r\n    to Canada where colored men are free. Oh how sweet the word do\r\n    sound to me yeas when I contemplate of these things, my very\r\n    flesh creaps my heart thrub when I think of my beloved friends\r\n    whom I left in that cursid hole. Oh my God what can I do for\r\n    them or shall I do for them. Lord help them. Suffer them to be\r\n    no longer depressed beneath the Bruat Creation but may they be\r\n    looked upon as men made of the Bone and Blood as the\r\n    Anglo-Americans. May God in his mercy Give Liberty to all this\r\n    world. I must close as it am late hour at night. I Remain your\r\n    friend in the cause of Liberty and humanity,\r\n\r\n    JOHN H.

This decision, however, had only been\r\nentertained by him a short time prior to his escape. For a number of\r\nyears Hezekiah had been laboring under the pleasing thought that he\r\nshould succeed in obtaining freedom through purchase, having had an\r\nunderstanding with his owner with this object in view. At different\r\ntimes he had paid on account for himself nineteen hundred dollars, six\r\nhundred dollars more than he was to have paid according to the first\r\nagreement. Although so shamefully defrauded in the first instance, he\r\nconcluded to bear the disappointment as patiently as possible and get\r\nout of the lion's mouth as best he could.\r\n\r\nHe continued to work on and save his money until he had actually come\r\nwithin one hundred dollars of paying two thousand. At this point instead\r\nof getting his free papers, as he firmly believed that he should, to his\r\nsurprise one day he saw a notorious trader approaching the shop where he\r\nwas at work. The errand of the trader was soon made known. Hezekiah\r\nsimply requested time to go back to the other end of the shop to get his\r\ncoat, which he seized and ran. He was pursued but not captured. This\r\noccurrence took place in Petersburg, Va., about the first of December,\r\n1854. On the night of the same day of his escape from the trader,\r\nHezekiah walked to Richmond and was there secreted under a floor by a\r\nfriend. He was a tall man, of powerful muscular strength, about thirty\r\nyears of age just in the prime of his manhood with enough pluck for two\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nA heavy reward was offered for him, but the hunters failed to find him\r\nin this hiding-place under the floor. He strongly hoped to get away\r\nsoon; on several occasions he made efforts, but only to be disappointed.\r\nAt different times at least two captains had consented to afford him a\r\nprivate passage to Philadelphia, but like the impotent man at the pool,\r\nsome one always got ahead of him. Two or three times he even managed to\r\nreach the boat upon the river, but had to return to his horrible place\r\nunder the floor. Some were under the impression that he was an\r\nexceedingly unlucky man, and for a time captains feared to bring him.\r\nBut his courage sustained him unwaveringly.\r\n\r\nFinally at the expiration of thirteen months, a private passage was\r\nprocured for him on the steamship Pennsylvania, and with a little slave\r\nboy, seven years of age, (the son of the man who had secreted him)\r\nthough placed in a very hard berth, he came safely to Philadelphia,\r\ngreatly to the astonishment of the Vigilance Committee, who had waited\r\nfor him so long that they had despaired of his ever coming.\r\n\r\nThe joy that filled Hezekiah's bosom may be imagined but never\r\ndescribed. None but one who had been in similar straits could enter into\r\nhis feelings.\r\n\r\nHe had left his wife Louisa, and two little boys, Henry and Manuel. His\r\npassage cost one hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nHezekiah being a noted character, a number of the true friends were\r\ninvited to take him by the hand and to rejoice with him over his noble\r\nstruggles and his triumph; needing rest and recruiting, he was made\r\nwelcome to stay, at the expense of the committee, as long as he might\r\nfeel disposed so to do. He remained several days, and then went on to\r\nCanada rejoicing. After arriving there he returned his acknowledgment\r\nfor favors received, &c., in the following letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n    TORONTO Jan 24th 1856.\r\n\r\n    MR. STILL:--this is to inform you that Myself and little boy,\r\n    arrived safely in this city this day the 24th, at ten o'clock\r\n    after a very long and pleasant trip.

I will\r\n    just say hare that when I arrived at New York, I found Mr. Gibbs\r\n    sick and could not be attended to there. However, I have arrived\r\n    alright.\r\n\r\n    You will please to give my respects to your friend that writes\r\n    in the office with you, and to Mr Smith, also Mr Brown, and the\r\n    friends, Mrs Still in particular.\r\n\r\n    Friend Still you will please to send the enclosed to John Hill\r\n    Petersburg I want him to send some things to me you will be so\r\n    kind as to send your direction to them, so that the things to\r\n    your care. if you do not see a convenient way to send it by\r\n    hands, you will please direct your letter to Phillip Ubank\r\n    Petersburg.\r\n\r\n    Yours Respectfully\r\n\r\n    H HILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES--(BROTHER OF JOHN HENRY HILL).\r\n\r\n\r\nFor three years James suffered in a place of concealment, before he\r\nfound the way opened to escape. When he resolved on having his freedom\r\nhe was much under twenty-one years of age, a brave young man, for three\r\nyears, with unfailing spirit, making resistance in the city of Richmond\r\nto the slave Power!\r\n\r\nSuch heroes in the days of Slavery, did much to make the infernal system\r\ninsecure, and to keep alive the spirit of freedom in liberty-loving\r\nhearts the world over, wherever such deeds of noble daring were made\r\nknown. But of his heroism, but little can be reported here, from the\r\nfact, that such accounts as were in the possession of the Committee,\r\nwere never transferred from the loose slips of paper on which they were\r\nfirst written, to the regular record book. But an important letter from\r\nthe friend with whom he was secreted, written a short while before he\r\nescaped (on a boat), gives some idea of his condition:\r\n\r\n\r\n    RICHMOND, VA., February 16th, 1861.\r\n\r\n    DEAR BROTHER STILL:--I received a message from brother Julius\r\n    anderson, asking me to send the bundle on but I has no way to\r\n    send it, I have been waiting and truly hopeing that you would\r\n    make some arrangement with some person, and send for the parcel.\r\n    I have no way to send it, and I cannot communicate the subject\r\n    to a stranger there is a Way by the N.y. line, but they are all\r\n    strangers to me, and of course I could not approach them With\r\n    this subject for I would be indangered myself greatly. this\r\n    business is left to you and to you alone to attend to in\r\n    providing the way for me to send on the parcel, if you only make\r\n    an arrangement with some person and let me know the said person\r\n    and the article which they is to be sent on then I can send the\r\n    parcel. unless you do make an arrangement with some person, and\r\n    assure them that they will receive the funs for delivering the\r\n    parcel this Business cannot be accomplished. it is in your power\r\n    to try to make some provision for the article to be sent but it\r\n    is not in my power to do so, the bundle has been on my hands now\r\n    going on 3 years, and I have suffered a great deal of danger,\r\n    and is still suffering the same. I have understood Sir that\r\n    there were no difficul about the mone that you had it in your\r\n    possession Ready for the bundle whenever it is delivered.

But his escape to freedom gave them a satisfaction which no words\r\ncan well express. At present, John Henry Hill is a justice of the peace\r\nin Petersburg. Hezekiah resides at West Point, and James in Boston,\r\nrejoicing that all men are free in the United States, at last.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM VIRGINIA, MARYLAND AND DELAWARE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHER BARLOW, ALIAS EMIT ROBINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis passenger arrived from Norfolk, Va. in 1853. For the last four\r\nyears previous to escaping, he had been under the yoke of Dr. George\r\nWilson. Archer declared that he had been \"very badly treated\" by the\r\nDoctor, which he urged as his reason for leaving. True, the doctor had\r\nbeen good enough to allow him to hire his time, for which he required\r\nArcher to pay the moderate sum of $120 per annum. As Archer had been\r\n\"sickly\" most of the time, during the last year, he complained that\r\nthere was \"no reduction\" in his hire on this account. Upon reflection,\r\ntherefore, Archer thought, if he had justice done him, he would be in\r\npossession of this \"one hundred and twenty\" himself, and all his other\r\nrights, instead of having to toil for another without pay; so he looked\r\nseriously into the matter of master and slave, and pretty soon resolved,\r\nthat if others chose to make no effort to get away, for himself he would\r\nnever be contented, until he was free. When a slave reached this\r\ndecision, he was in a very hopeful state. He was near the Underground\r\nRail Road, and was sure to find it, sooner or later. At this thoughtful\r\nperiod, Archer was thirty-one years of age, a man of medium size, and\r\nbelonged to the two leading branches of southern humanity, _i.e._, he\r\n_was_ half white and half colored--a dark mulatto. His arrival in\r\nPhiladelphia, per one of the Richmond steamers, was greeted with joy by\r\nthe Vigilance Committee, who extended to him the usual aid and care, and\r\nforwarded him on to freedom. For a number of years, he has been a\r\ncitizen of Boston.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL BUSH, ALIAS WILLIAM OBLEBEE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis \"piece of property\" fled in the fall of 1853. As a specimen of this\r\narticle of commerce, he evinced considerable intelligence. He was a man\r\nof dark color, although not totally free from the admixture of the\r\n\"superior\" southern blood in his veins; in stature, he was only\r\nordinary. For leaving, he gave the following reasons: \"I found that I\r\nwas working for my master, for his advantage, and when I was sick, I had\r\nto pay just as much as if I were well--$7 a month. But my master was\r\ncross, and said that he intended to sell me--to do better by me another\r\nyear. Times grew worse and worse, constantly. I thought, as I had heard,\r\nthat if I could raise thirty dollars I could come away.\" He at once saw\r\nthe value of money. To his mind it meant liberty from that moment.\r\nThenceforth he decided to treasure up every dollar he could get hold of\r\nuntil he could accumulate at least enough to get out of \"Old Virginia.\"\r\nHe was a married man, and thought he had a wife and one child, but on\r\nreflection, he found out that they did not actually belong to him, but\r\nto a carpenter, by the name of Bailey. The man whom Samuel was compelled\r\nto call master was named Hoyle.\r\n\r\nThe Committee's interview with Samuel was quite satisfactory, and they\r\ncheerfully accorded to him brotherly kindness and material aid at the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN SPENCER AND HIS SON WILLIAM, AND JAMES ALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese individuals escaped from the eastern shore of Maryland, in the\r\nSpring of 1853, but were led to conclude that they could enjoy the\r\nfreedom they had aimed to find, in New Jersey. They procured employment\r\nin the neighborhood of Haddonfield, some six or eight miles from Camden,\r\nNew Jersey, and were succeeding, as they thought, very well.\r\n\r\nThings went on favorably for about three months, when to their alarm\r\n\"slave-hunters were discovered in the neighborhood,\" and sufficient\r\nevidence was obtained to make it quite plain that, John, William and\r\nJames were the identical persons, for whom the hunters were in \"hot\r\npursuit.\" When brought to the Committee, they were pretty thoroughly\r\nalarmed and felt very anxious to be safely off to Canada. While the\r\nCommittee always rendered in such cases immediate protection and aid,\r\nthey nevertheless, felt, in view of the imminent dangers existing under\r\nthe fugitive slave law, that persons disposed to thus stop by the way,\r\nshould be very plainly given to understand, that if they were captured\r\nthey would have themselves the most to blame. But the dread of Slavery\r\nwas strong in the minds of these fugitives, and they very fully realized\r\ntheir folly in stopping in New Jersey. The Committee procured their\r\ntickets, helped them to disguise themselves as much as possible, and\r\nadmonished them not to stop short of Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHETTY SCOTT ALIAS MARGARET DUNCANS AND DAUGHTER PRISCILLA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mother and daughter had been the \"chattels personal\" of Daniel\r\nCoolby of Harvard, Md. Their lot had been that of ordinary slaves in the\r\ncountry, on farms, &c. The motive which prompted them to escape was the\r\nfact that their master had \"threatened to sell\" them. He had a right to\r\ndo so; but Hetty was a little squeamish on this point and took great\r\numbrage at her \"kind master.\" In this \"disobedient\" state of mind, she\r\ndetermined, if hard struggling would enable her, to defeat the threats\r\nof Mr. Daniel Coolby, that he should not much longer have the\r\nsatisfaction of enjoying the fruit of the toil of herself and offspring.\r\nShe at once began to prepare for her journey.\r\n\r\nShe had three children of her own to bring, besides she was intimately\r\nacquainted with a young man and a young woman, both slaves, to whom she\r\nfelt that it would be safe to confide her plans with a view of inviting\r\nthem to accompany her. The young couple were ready converts to the\r\neloquent speech delivered to them by Hetty on Freedom, and were quite\r\nwilling to accept her as their leader in the emergency. Up to the hour\r\nof setting out on their lonely and fatiguing journey, arrangements were\r\nbeing carefully completed, so that there should be no delay of any kind.\r\nAt the appointed hour they were all moving northward in good order.\r\n\r\nArriving at Quakertown, Pa., they found friends of the slave, who\r\nwelcomed them to their homes and sympathy, gladdening the hearts of all\r\nconcerned. For prudential reasons it was deemed desirable to separate\r\nthe party, to send some one way and some another. Thus safely, through\r\nthe kind offices and aid of the friends at Quakertown, they were duly\r\nforwarded on to the Committee in Philadelphia. Here similar acts of\r\ncharity were extended to them, and they were directed on to Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT FISHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS PASSENGER AVAILS HIMSELF OF HOLIDAY WEEK, BETWEEN CHRISTMAS AND NEW\r\nYEAR'S, TO MAKE HIS NORTHERN TRIP. Robert was about thirty years of age,\r\ndark color, quite tall, and in talking with him a little while, it was\r\nsoon discovered that Slavery had not crushed all the brains out of his\r\nhead by a good deal. Nor was he so much attached to his \"kind-hearted\r\nmaster,\" John Edward Jackson, of Anne Arundel, Md., or his old fiddle,\r\nthat he was contented and happy while in bondage. Far from it. The fact\r\nwas, that he hated Slavery so decidedly and had such a clear common\r\nsense-like view of the evils and misery of the system, that he declared\r\nhe had as a matter of principle refrained from marrying, in order that\r\nhe might have no reason to grieve over having added to the woes of\r\nslaves. Nor did he wish to be encumbered, if the opportunity offered to\r\nescape. According to law he was entitled to his freedom at the age of\r\ntwenty-five.\r\n\r\nBut what right had a negro, which white slave-holders were \"bound to\r\nrespect?\" Many who had been willed free, were held just as firmly in\r\nSlavery, as if no will had ever been made. Robert had too much sense to\r\nsuppose that he could gain anything by seeking legal redress. This\r\nmethod, therefore, was considered out of the question. But in the\r\nmeantime he was growing very naturally in favor of the Underground Rail\r\nRoad. From his experience Robert did not hesitate to say that his master\r\nwas \"mean,\" \"a very hard man,\" who would work his servants early and\r\nlate, without allowing them food and clothing sufficient to shield them\r\nfrom the cold and hunger. Robert certainly had unmistakable marks about\r\nhim, of having been used roughly. He thought very well of Nathan Harris,\r\na fellow-servant belonging to the same owner, and he made up his mind,\r\nif Nathan would join him, neither the length of the journey, the\r\nloneliness of night travel, the coldness of the weather, the fear of the\r\nslave-hunter, nor the scantiness of their means should deter him from\r\nmaking his way to freedom. Nathan listened to the proposal, and was\r\nsuddenly converted to freedom, and the two united during Christmas week,\r\n1854, and set out on the Underground Rail Road. It is needless to say\r\nthat they had trying difficulties to encounter. These they expected, but\r\nall were overcome, and they reached the Vigilance Committee, in\r\nPhiladelphia safely, and were cordially welcomed. During the interview,\r\na full interchange of thought resulted, the fugitives were well cared\r\nfor, and in due time both were forwarded on, free of cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHANSEL WAPLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis traveler arrived from Millsboro, Indian River, Delaware, where he\r\nwas owned by Wm. E. Burton. While Hansel did not really own himself, he\r\nhad the reputation of having a wife and six children. In June, some six\r\nmonths prior to her husband's arrival, Hansel's wife had been allowed by\r\nher mistress to go out on a begging expedition, to raise money to buy\r\nherself; but contrary to the expectation of her mistress she never\r\nreturned. Doubtless the mistress looked upon this course as a piece of\r\nthe most highhanded stealing. Hansel did not speak of his owner as being\r\na hard man, but on the contrary he thought that he was about as \"good\"\r\nas the best that he was acquainted with. While this was true, however,\r\nHansel had quite good ground for believing that his master was about to\r\nsell him. Dreading this fate he made up his mind to go in pursuit of his\r\nwife to a Free state. Exactly where to look or how to find her he could\r\nnot tell.\r\n\r\nThe Committee advised him to \"search in Canada.\" And in order to enable\r\nhim to get on quickly and safely, the Committee aided him with money,\r\n&c., in 1853.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROSE ANNA TONNELL ALIAS MARIA HYDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe fled from Isaac Tonnell of Georgetown, Delaware, in Christmas week,\r\n1853. A young woman with a little boy of seven years of age accompanied\r\nRose Anna. Further than the simple fact of their having thus safely\r\narrived, except the expense incurred by the Committee, no other\r\nparticulars appear on the records.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARY ENNIS ALIAS LICIA HEMMIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMary arrived with her two children in the early Spring of 1854.\r\n\r\nThe mother was a woman of about thirty-three years of age, quite tall,\r\nwith a countenance and general appearance well fitted to awaken sympathy\r\nat first sight. Her oldest child was a little girl seven years of age,\r\nnamed Lydia; the other was named Louisa Caroline, three years of age,\r\nboth promising in appearance. They were the so called property of John\r\nEnnis, of Georgetown, Delaware. For their flight they chose the dead of\r\nWinter. After leaving they made their way to West Chester, and there\r\nfound friends and security for several weeks, up to the time they\r\nreached Philadelphia. Probably the friends with whom they stopped\r\nthought the weather too inclement for a woman with children dependent on\r\nher support to travel. Long before this mother escaped, thoughts of\r\nliberty filled her heart. She was ever watching for an opportunity, that\r\nwould encourage her to hope for safety, when once the attempt should be\r\nmade. Until, however, she was convinced that her two children were to be\r\nsold, she could not quite muster courage to set out on the journey. This\r\nthreat to sell proved in multitudes of instances, \"the last straw on the\r\ncamel's back.\" When nothing else would start them this would. Mary and\r\nher children were the only slaves owned by this Ennis, consequently her\r\nduties were that of \"Jack of all trades;\" sometimes in the field and\r\nsometimes in the barn, as well as in the kitchen, by which, it is\r\nneedless to say, that her life was rendered servile to the last degree.\r\n\r\nTo bind up the broken heart of such a poor slave mother, and to aid such\r\ntender plants as were these little girls, from such a wretched state of\r\nbarbarism as existed in poor little Delaware, was doubly gratifying to\r\nthe Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"SAM,\" \"ISAAC,\" \"PERRY,\" \"CHARLES,\" AND \"GREEN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS REWARD.--Ran away on Saturday night, the\r\n    20th September, 1856, from the subscriber, living in the ninth\r\n    district of Carroll county, Maryland, two Negro Men, SAM and\r\n    ISAAC. Sam calls himself Samuel Sims; he is very black; shows\r\n    his teeth very much when he laughs; no perceptible marks; he is\r\n    5 feet 8 inches high, and about thirty years of age, but has the\r\n    appearance of being much older.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    Isaac calls himself Isaac Dotson he is about nineteen years of\r\n    age, stout made, but rather chunky; broad across his shoulders,\r\n    he is about five feet five or six inches high, always appears to\r\n    be in a good humor; laughs a good deal, and runs on with a good\r\n    deal of foolishness; he is of very light color, almost yellow,\r\n    might be called a yellow boy; has no perceptible marks.\r\n\r\n    They have such a variety of clothing that it is almost useless\r\n    to say anything about them.

THOMAS B.\r\n    OWINGS.\r\n\r\n    s24-6tWit*||\r\n\r\n\r\nThese passengers reached the Philadelphia station, about the 24th of\r\nSeptember, 1856, five days after they escaped from Carroll county. They\r\nwere in fine spirits, and had borne the fatigue and privation of travel\r\nbravely. A free and interesting interview took place, between these\r\npassengers and the Committee, eliciting much information, especially\r\nwith regard to the workings of the system on the farms, from which they\r\nhad the good luck to flee. Each of the party was thoroughly questioned,\r\nabout how time had passed with them at home, or rather in the prison\r\nhouse, what kind of men their masters were, how they fed and clothed, if\r\nthey whipped, bought or sold, whether they were members of church, or\r\nnot, and many more questions needless to enumerate bearing on the\r\ndomestic relation which had existed between themselves and their\r\nmasters. These queries they answered in their own way, with\r\nintelligence. Upon the whole, their lot in Slavery had been rather more\r\nfavorable than the average run of slaves.\r\n\r\nNo record was made of any very severe treatment. In fact, the notices\r\nmade of them were very brief, and, but for the elaborate way in which\r\nthey were described in the \"Baltimore Sun,\" by their owners, their\r\nnarratives would hardly be considered of sufficient interest to record.\r\nThe heavy rewards, beautiful descriptions, and elegant illustrations in\r\nthe \"Sun,\" were very attractive reading. The Vigilance Committee took\r\nthe \"Sun,\" for nothing else under the sun but for this special\r\nliterature, and for this purpose they always considered the \"Sun\" a\r\ncheap and reliable paper.\r\n\r\nA slave man or woman, running for life, he with a bundle on his back or\r\nshe with a babe in her arms, was always a very interesting sight, and\r\nshould always be held in remembrance. Likewise the descriptions given by\r\nslave-holders, as a general rule, showed considerable artistic powers\r\nand a most thorough knowledge of the physical outlines of this peculiar\r\nproperty. Indeed, the art must have been studied attentively for\r\npractical purposes. When the advertisements were received in advance of\r\narrivals, which was always the case, the descriptions generally were\r\nfound so lifelike, that the Committee preferred to take them in\r\npreference to putting themselves to the labor of writing out new ones,\r\nfor future reference. This we think, ought not to be complained of by\r\nany who were so unfortunate as to lose wayward servants, as it is but\r\nfair to give credit to all concerned. True, sometimes some of these\r\nbeautiful advertisements were open to gentle criticism. The one at the\r\nhead of this report, is clearly of this character. For instance, in\r\ndescribing Isaac, Mr. Thomas B. Owings, represents him as being of a\r\n\"very light color,\" \"almost yellow,\" \"might be called a yellow boy.\" In\r\nthe next breath he has no perceptible marks. Now, if he is \"very light,\"\r\nthat is a well-known southern mark, admitted everywhere. A hint to the\r\nwise is sufficient. However, judging from what was seen of Isaac in\r\nPhiladelphia, there was more cunning than \"foolishness\" about him.\r\nSlaves sometimes, when wanting to get away, would make their owners\r\nbelieve that they were very happy and contented. And, in using this kind\r\nof foolishness, would keep up appearances until an opportunity offered\r\nfor an escape. So Isaac might have possessed this sagacity, which\r\nappeared like nonsense to his master. That slave-holders, above all\r\nothers, were in the habit of taking special pains to encourage\r\nfoolishness, loud laughing, banjo playing, low dancing, etc., in the\r\nplace of education, virtue, self-respect and manly carriage,\r\nslave-holders themselves are witnesses.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Robert Dade was also a loser, equally with Mr. Thomas B. Owings,\r\nand as his advertisement was of the same liberality and high tone, it\r\nseems but fitting that it should come in just here, to give weight and\r\ncompleteness to the story. Both Owings and Dade showed a considerable\r\ndegree of southern chivalry in the liberality of their rewards.\r\nDoubtless, the large sums thus offered awakened a lively feeling in the\r\nbreasts of old slave-hunters. But it is to be supposed that the artful\r\nfugitives safely reached Philadelphia before the hunters got even the\r\nfirst scent on their track. Up to the present hour, with the owners all\r\nmay be profound mystery; if so, it is to be hoped, that they may feel\r\nsome interest in the solution of these wonders. The articles so\r\naccurately described must now be permitted to testify in their own\r\nwords, as taken from the records.\r\n\r\nGreen Modock acknowledges that he was owned by William Dorsey, Perry by\r\nRobert Dade, Sam and Isaac by Thomas Owings, all farmers, and all\r\n\"tough\" and \"pretty mean men.\" Sam and Isaac had other names with them,\r\nbut not such a variety of clothing as their master might have supposed.\r\nSam said he left because his master threatened to sell him to Georgia,\r\nand he believed that he meant so to do, as he had sold all his brothers\r\nand sisters to Georgia some time before he escaped.\r\n\r\nBut this was not all. Sam declared his master had threatened to shoot\r\nhim a short while before he left. This was the last straw on the camel's\r\nback. Sam's heart was in Canada ever after that. In traveling he\r\nresolved that nothing should stop him. Charles offered the same excuse\r\nas did Sam. He had been threatened with the auction-block. He left his\r\nmother free, but four sisters he left in chains. As these men spoke of\r\ntheir tough owners and bad treatment in Slavery, they expressed their\r\nindignation at the idea that Owings, Dade and Dorsey had dared to rob\r\nthem of their God-given rights. They were only ignorant farm hands. As\r\nthey drank in the free air, the thought of their wrongs aroused all\r\ntheir manhood. They were all young men, hale and stout, with strong\r\nresolutions to make Canada their future home. The Committee encouraged\r\nthem in this, and aided them for humanity's sake.--Mr. Robert Dade's\r\nadvertisement speaks for itself as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    RAN AWAY--On Saturday night, 20th inst., from the subscriber,\r\n    living near Mount Airy P.O., Carroll county, two Negro men,\r\n    PERRY and CHARLES. Perry is quite dark, full face; is about 5\r\n    feet 8 or 9 inches high; has a scar on one of his hands, and one\r\n    on his legs, caused by a cut from a scythe; 25 years old.\r\n    Charles is of a copper color, about 5 feet 9 or 10 inches high;\r\n    round shouldered, with small whiskers; has one crooked finger\r\n    that he cannot straighten, and a scar on his right leg, caused\r\n    by the cut of a scythe; 22 years old. I will give two hundred\r\n    and fifty dollars each, if taken in the State and returned to\r\n    me, or secured in some jail so that I can get them again, or a\r\n    $1,000 for the two, or $500 each, if taken out of the State, and\r\n    secured in some jail in this State so that I can get them again.\r\n    ROBERT DADE.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    s23-3f.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM RICHMOND AND NORFOLK, VA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM B. WHITE, SUSAN BROOKS AND WILLIAM HENRY ATKINS.--STOWED AWAY IN\r\nTHE STEAMSHIP CITY OF RICHMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut for their hope of liberty, their uncomfortable position could hardly\r\nhave been endured by these fugitives. William had been compelled to dig\r\nand delve, to earn bread and butter, clothing and luxuries, houses and\r\nland, education and ease for H.B. Dickinson, of Richmond. William\r\nsmarted frequently; but what could he do? Complaint from a slave was a\r\ncrime of the deepest dye. So William dug away mutely, but continued to\r\nthink, nevertheless. He was a man of about thirty-six years of age, of\r\ndark chestnut color, medium size, and of pleasant manners to say the\r\nleast. His owner was a tobacco manufacturer, who held some thirty slaves\r\nin his own right, besides hiring a great many others. William was\r\nregularly employed by day in his master's tobacco factory. He was\r\nlikewise employed, as one of the carriers of the Richmond Dispatch; the\r\ntime allotted to fill the duties of this office, was however, before\r\nsunrise in the morning. It is but just to state, in favor of his master,\r\nthat William was himself the receiver of a part of the pay for this\r\nnight work. It was by this means William procured clothing and certain\r\nother necessaries.\r\n\r\nFrom William's report of his master, he was by no means among the worst\r\nof slave-holders in Richmond; he did not himself flog, but the overseer\r\nwas allowed to conduct this business, when it was considered necessary.\r\nFor a long time William had cherished a strong desire to be free, and\r\nhad gone so far on several occasions as to make unsuccessful attempts to\r\naccomplish this end. At last he was only apprised of his opportunity to\r\ncarry his wishes into practice a few moments before the hour for the\r\nstarting of the Underground Rail Road train.\r\n\r\nBeing on the watch, he hailed the privilege, and left without looking\r\nback.\r\n\r\nTrue he left his wife and two children, who were free, and a son also\r\nwho was owned by Warner Toliver, of Gloucester county, Va. We leave the\r\nreader to decide for himself, whether William did right or wrong, and\r\nwho was responsible for the sorrow of both husband and wife caused by\r\nthe husband's course. The Committee received him as a true and honest\r\nfriend of freedom, and as such aided him.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUSAN BROOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan was also a passenger on the same ship that brought Wm. B. White.\r\nShe was from Norfolk. Her toil, body and strength were claimed by Thomas\r\nEckels, Esq., a man of wealth and likewise a man of intemperance. With\r\nthose who regarded Slavery as a \"divine institution,\" intemperance was\r\nscarcely a mote, in the eyes of such. For sixteen years, Susan had been\r\nin the habit of hiring her time, for which she was required to pay five\r\ndollars per month. As she had the reputation of being a good cook and\r\nchambermaid, she was employed steadily, sometimes on boats. This sum may\r\ntherefore be considered reasonable.\r\n\r\nOwing to the death of her husband, about a year previous to her escape,\r\nshe had suffered greatly, so much so, that on two or three occasions,\r\nshe had fallen into alarming fits,--a fact by no means agreeable to her\r\nowner, as he feared that the traders on learning her failing health\r\nwould underrate her on this account. But Susan was rather thankful for\r\nthese signs of weakness, as she was thereby enabled to mature her plans\r\nand thus to elude detection.\r\n\r\nHer son having gone on ahead to Canada about six months in advance of\r\nher, she felt that she had strong ties in the goodly land. Every day she\r\nremained in bondage, the cords bound her more tightly, and \"weeks seemed\r\nlike months, and months like years,\" so abhorrent had the peculiar\r\ninstitution become to her in every particular. In this state of mind,\r\nshe saw no other way, than by submitting to be secreted, until an\r\nopportunity should offer, via the Underground Rail Road.\r\n\r\nSo for four months, like a true and earnest woman, she endured a great\r\n\"fight of affliction,\" in this horrible place. But the thought of\r\nfreedom enabled her to keep her courage up, until the glad news was\r\nconveyed to her that all things were ready, providing that she could get\r\nsafely to the boat, on which she was to be secreted. How she succeeded\r\nin so doing the record book fails to explain.\r\n\r\nOne of the methods, which used to succeed very well, in skillful and\r\nbrave hands, was this: In order to avoid suspicion, the woman intending\r\nto be secreted, approached the boat with a clean ironed shirt on her\r\narm, bare headed and in her usual working dress, looking good-natured of\r\ncourse, and as if she were simply conveying the shirt to one of the men\r\non the boat. The attention of the officer on the watch would not for a\r\nmoment be attracted by a custom so common as this. Thus safely on the\r\nboat, the man whose business it was to put this piece of property in the\r\nmost safe Underground Rail Road place, if he saw that every thing looked\r\nfavorable, would quickly arrange matters without being missed from his\r\nduties. In numerous instances, officers were outwitted in this way.\r\n\r\nAs to what Susan had seen in the way of hardships, whether in relation\r\nto herself or others, her story was most interesting; but it may here be\r\npassed in order to make room for others. She left one sister, named Mary\r\nAnn Tharagood, who was wanting to come away very much. Susan was a woman\r\nof dark color, round built, medium height, and about forty years of age\r\nwhen she escaped in 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HENRY ATKINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry was also a fellow-passenger on the same boat with William\r\nB. White and Susan Cooke. These might be set down, as first-class\r\nUnderground Rail Road travelers.\r\n\r\nHenry was a very likely-looking article. He was quite smart, about six\r\nfeet high, a dark mulatto, and was owned by a Baptist minister.\r\n\r\nFor some cause not stated on the books, not long before leaving, Henry\r\nhad received a notice from his owner, (the Baptist Minister) that he\r\nmight hunt himself a new master as soon as possible. This was a business\r\nthat Henry had no relish for. The owner he already had, he concluded bad\r\nenough in all conscience, and it did not occur to him that hunting\r\nanother would mend the matter much. So in thinking over the situation,\r\nhe was \"taken sick.\" He felt the need of a little time to reflect upon\r\nmatters of very weighty moment involving his freedom. So when he was\r\ncalled upon one day to go to his regular toil, the answer was, \"I am\r\nsick, I am not able to budge hardly.\" The excuse took and Henry attended\r\nfaithfully to his \"sick business,\" for the time being, while on the\r\nother hand, the Baptist Minister waited patiently all the while for\r\nWilliam to get well enough for hunting a new master. What had to be\r\ndone, needed to be done quickly, before his master's patience was\r\nexhausted. William soon had matters arranged for traveling North. He had\r\na wife, Eliza, for whom he felt the greatest affection; but as he viewed\r\nmatters at that time, he concluded that he could really do more for her\r\nin Canada than he could in Norfolk. He saw no chance, either under the\r\nBaptist minister, or under a new master. His wife was owned by Susan\r\nLangely. When the hour arrived to start, as brave men usually do, Henry,\r\nhaving counted all the cost, was in his place on the boat with his face\r\ntowards Canada.\r\n\r\nHow he looked at matters on John Bull's side of the house, letters from\r\nHenry will abundantly reveal as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ST. CATHARINES, August 4, 1854.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SIR:--It is with plesure that I now take my pen to\r\n    inform you that I am well at present and I hope that these few\r\n    lines may find you injoying good health, and will you plese to\r\n    be so kind as to send a leter down home for me if you plese to\r\n    my wife, the reason that I beg the favor of you I have written\r\n    to you several times and never recieve no answer, she don't no\r\n    whar I am at I would like her to no, if it is posible elizeran\r\n    Actkins, and when you write will you plese to send me all the\r\n    news, give my respect to all the fambley and allso to Mr lundey\r\n    and his fambley and tell him plese to send me those books if you\r\n    plese the first chance you can git.

ACTKINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    ST. CATHARINES, C.W., October 5th, 1854.\r\n\r\n    MR. WILLIAM STILL:--_Dear Friend_:--I take the liberty to\r\n    address to you a few lines in behalf of my wife, who is still at\r\n    Norfolk, Va. I have heard by my friend Richmond Bohm, who\r\n    arrived lately, that she was in the hands of my friend Henry\r\n    Lovey (the same who had me in hand at the time I started). I\r\n    understood that she was about to make her start this month, and\r\n    that she was only waiting for me to send her some means. I would\r\n    like for you to communicate the substance of this letter to my\r\n    wife, through my friend Henry Lovey, and for her to come on as\r\n    soon as she can. I would like to have my wife write to me a few\r\n    lines by the first opportunity. She could write to you in\r\n    Philadelphia, 31 North Fifth street. I wish to send my love to\r\n    you & your family & would like for you to answer this letter\r\n    with the least possible delay in the care of Hiram Wilson.\r\n\r\n    Very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n    W.H. ATKINS.\r\n\r\n    P.S. I would like for my friend Henry Lovey to send my wife\r\n    right on to Philadelphia; not to stop for want of means, for I\r\n    will forward means on to my friend Wm Still. My love to my\r\n    father & mother, my friend Lovey & to all my inquiring friends.\r\n    If you cannot find it convenient to write, please forward this\r\n    by the Boat. H.W.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUR ARRIVALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLOTTE AND HARRIET ESCAPE IN DEEP MOURNING--MASTER IN THE SAME CAR\r\nHUNTING FOR THEM, SEES THEM, BUT DOES NOT KNOW THEM--WHITE LADY AND\r\nCHILD WITH A COLORED COACHMAN, TRAVELING--AT CHAMBERSBUEG AT A HOTEL,\r\nTHE PROPRIETOR DETECTS THEM AS U.G.R.R. PASSENGERS--THREE \"LIKELY\" YOUNG\r\nMEN FROM BALTIMORE--\"FOUR LARGE AND TWO SMALL HAMS\"--POLICE OFFICES\r\nIMPARTING INFORMATION AT THE ANTI-SLAVERY OFFICE--U.G.R.R. PASSENGERS\r\nTRAVELING WITH THEIR MASTERS' HORSES AND CARRIAGES--\"BREAK\r\nDOWN\"--CONFLICT WITH WHITE MEN--SIX PASSENGERS RIDING TWO HORSES, &c.\r\nAbout the 31st of May, 1856, an exceedingly anxious state of feeling\r\nexisted with the active Committee in Philadelphia. In the course of\r\ntwenty-four hours four arrivals had come to hand from different\r\nlocalities. The circumstances connected with the escape of each party,\r\nbeing so unusual, there was scarcely ground for any other conclusion\r\nthan that disaster was imminent, if not impossible to be averted.\r\n\r\nIt was a day long to be remembered. Aside from the danger, however, a\r\nmore encouraging hour had never presented itself in the history of the\r\nRoad. The courage, which had so often been shown in the face of great\r\ndanger, satisfied the Committee that there were heroes and heroines\r\namong these passengers, fully entitled to the applause of the\r\nliberty-loving citizens of Brotherly Love. The very idea of having to\r\nwalk for days and nights in succession, over strange roads, through\r\nby-ways, and valleys, over mountains, and marshes, was fitted to appal\r\nthe bravest hearts, especially where women and children were concerned.\r\n\r\nBeing familiar with such cases, the Committee was delighted beyond\r\nmeasure to observe how wisely and successfully each of these parties had\r\nmanaged to overcome these difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParty No. 1 consisted of Charlotte Giles and Harriet Eglin, owned by\r\nCapt. Wm. Applegarth and John Delahay. Neither of these girls had any\r\ngreat complaint to make on the score of ill-treatment endured.\r\n\r\nSo they contrived each to get a suit of mourning, with heavy black\r\nveils, and thus dressed, apparently absorbed with grief, with a friend\r\nto pass them to the Baltimore depot (hard place to pass, except aided by\r\nan individual well known to the R.R. company), they took a direct course\r\nfor Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nWhile seated in the car, before leaving Baltimore (where slaves and\r\nmasters both belonged), who should enter but the master of one of the\r\ngirls! In a very excited manner, he hurriedly approached Charlotte and\r\nHarriet, who were apparently weeping. Peeping under their veils, \"What\r\nis your name,\" exclaimed the excited gentleman. \"Mary, sir,\" sobbed\r\nCharlotte. \"What is your name?\" (to the other mourner) \"Lizzie, sir,\"\r\nwas the faint reply. On rushed the excited gentleman as if moved by\r\nsteam--through the cars, looking for his property; not finding it, he\r\npassed out of the cars, and to the delight of Charlotte and Harriet soon\r\ndisappeared. Fair business men would be likely to look at this conduct\r\non the part of the two girls in the light of a \"sharp practice.\" In\r\nmilitary parlance it might be regarded as excellent strategy. Be this as\r\nit may, the Underground Rail Road passengers arrived safely at the\r\nPhiladelphia station and were gladly received.\r\n\r\nA brief stay in the city was thought prudent lest the hunters might be\r\non the pursuit. They were, therefore, retained in safe quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Arrival No. 2 reached the Committee. It consisted of a\r\ncolored man, a white woman and a child, ten years old. This case created\r\nno little surprise. Not that quite a number of passengers, fair enough\r\nto pass for white, with just a slight tinge of colored blood in their\r\nveins, even sons and daughters of some of the F.F.V., had not on various\r\noccasions come over the U.G.R.R. But this party was peculiar. An\r\nexplanation was sought, which resulted in ascertaining that the party\r\nwas from Leesburg, Virginia; that David, the colored man, was about\r\ntwenty-seven years of age, intelligent, and was owned, or claimed by\r\nJoshua Pusey. David had no taste for Slavery, indeed, felt that it would\r\nbe impossible for him to adapt himself to a life of servitude for the\r\nspecial benefit of others; he had, already, as he thought, been dealt\r\nwith very wrongfully by Pusey, who had deprived him of many years of the\r\nbest part of his life, and would continue thus to wrong him, if he did\r\nnot make a resolute effort to get away. So after thinking of various\r\nplans, he determined not to run off as a slave with his \"budget on his\r\nback,\" but to \"travel as a coachman,\" under the \"protection of a white\r\nlady.\" In planning this pleasant scheme, David was not blind to the fact\r\nthat neither himself nor the \"white lady,\" with whom he proposed to\r\ntravel, possessed either horse or carriage.\r\n\r\nBut his master happened to have a vehicle that would answer for the\r\noccasion. David reasoned that as Joshua, his so called master, had\r\ndeprived him of his just dues for so many years, he had a right to\r\nborrow, or take without borrowing, one of Joshua's horses for the\r\nexpedition. The plan was submitted to the lady, and was approved, and a\r\nmutual understanding here entered into, that she should hire a carriage,\r\nand take also her little girl with them. The lady was to assume the\r\nproprietorship of the horse, carriage and coachman. In so doing all\r\ndangers would be, in their judgment, averted. The scheme being all ready\r\nfor execution, the time for departure was fixed, the carriage hired,\r\nDavid having secured his master Joshua's horse, and off they started in\r\nthe direction of Pennsylvania. White people being so accustomed to\r\nriding, and colored people to driving, the party looked all right. No\r\none suspected them, that they were aware of, while passing through\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nOn reaching Chambersburg, Pa., in the evening, they drove to a hotel,\r\nthe lady alighted, holding by the hand her well dressed and nice-looking\r\nlittle daughter, bearing herself with as independent an air as if she\r\nhad owned twenty such boys as accompanied her as coachman. She did not\r\nhesitate to enter and request accommodations for the night, for herself,\r\ndaughter, coachman, and horse. Being politely told that they could be\r\naccommodated, all that was necessary was, that the lady should show off\r\nto the best advantage possible. The same duty also rested with weight\r\nupon the mind of David.\r\n\r\nThe night passed safely and the morning was ushered in with bright hopes\r\nwhich were overcast but only for a moment, however. Breakfast having\r\nbeen ordered and partaken of, to the lady's surprise, just as she was in\r\nthe act of paying the bill, the proprietor of the hotel intimated that\r\nhe thought that matters \"looked a little suspicious,\" in other words, he\r\nsaid plainly, that he \"believed that it was an Underground Rail Road\r\nmovement;\" but being an obliging hotel-keeper, he assured her at the\r\nsame time, that he \"would not betray them.\" Just here it was with them\r\nas it would have been on any other rail road when things threaten to\r\ncome to a stand; they could do nothing more than make their way out of\r\nthe peril as best they could. One thing they decided to do immediately,\r\nnamely, to \"leave the horse and carriage,\" and try other modes of\r\ntravel. They concluded to take the regular passenger cars. In this way\r\nthey reached Philadelphia. In Harrisburg, they had sought and received\r\ninstructions how to find the Committee in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nWhat relations had previously existed between David and this lady in\r\nVirginia, the Committee knew not. It looked more like the time spoken of\r\nin Isaiah, where it is said, \"And a little child shall lead them,\" than\r\nany thing that had ever been previously witnessed on the Underground\r\nRail Road. The Underground Rail Road never practised the proscription\r\ngoverning other roads, on account of race, color, or previous condition.\r\nAll were welcome to its immunities, white or colored, when the object to\r\nbe gained favored freedom, or weakened Slavery. As the sole aim apparent\r\nin this case was freedom for the slave the Committee received these\r\ntravellers as Underground Rail Road passengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArrival No. 3. Charles H. Ringold, Robert Smith, and John Henry\r\nRichards, all from Baltimore. Their ages ranged from twenty to\r\ntwenty-four years. They were in appearance of the class most inviting to\r\nmen who were in the business of buying and selling slaves. Charles and\r\nJohn were owned by James Hodges, and Robert by Wm. H. Normis, living in\r\nBaltimore. This is all that the records contain of them. The exciting\r\nand hurrying times when they were in charge of the Committee probably\r\nforbade the writing out of a more detailed account of them, as was often\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nWith the above three arrivals on hand, it may be seen how great was the\r\ndanger to which all concerned were exposed on account of the bold and\r\nopen manner in which these parties had escaped from the land of the\r\npeculiar institution. Notwithstanding, a feeling of very great\r\ngratification existed in view of the success attending the new and\r\nadventurous modes of traveling. Indulging in reflections of this sort,\r\nthe writer on going from his dinner that day to the anti-slavery office,\r\nto his surprise found an officer awaiting his coming. Said officer was\r\nof the mayor's police force. Before many moments had been allowed to\r\npass, in which to conjecture his errand, the officer, evidently burdened\r\nwith the importance of his mission, began to state his business\r\nsubstantially as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I have just received a telegraphic despatch from a slave-holder living\r\nin Maryland, informing me that six slaves had escaped from him, and that\r\nhe had reason to believe that they were on their way to Philadelphia,\r\nand would come in the regular train direct from Harrisburg; furthermore\r\nI am requested to be at the depot on the arrival of the train to arrest\r\nthe whole party, for whom a reward of $1300 is offered. Now I am not the\r\nman for this business. I would have nothing to do with the contemptible\r\nwork of arresting fugitives. I'd rather help them off. What I am telling\r\nyou is confidential. My object in coming to the office is simply to\r\nnotify the Vigilance Committee so that they may be on the look-out for\r\nthem at the depot this evening and get them out of danger as soon as\r\npossible. This is the way I feel about them; but I shall telegraph back\r\nthat I will be on the look-out.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the officer was giving this information he was listened to most\r\nattentively, and every word he uttered was carefully weighed. An air of\r\ntruthfulness, however, was apparent; nevertheless he was a stranger and\r\nthere was cause for great cautiousness. During the interview an unopened\r\ntelegraphic despatch which had come to hand during the writer's absence,\r\nlay on the desk. Impressed with the belief that it might shed light on\r\nthe officer's story, the first opportunity that offered, it was seized,\r\nopened, and it read as follows: (Copied from the original.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    HARRISBURG, May 31st, 1856.\r\n\r\n    WM. STILL, N. 5th St.:--I have sent via at two o'clock four\r\n    large and two small hams.\r\n\r\n    JOS. C. BUSTILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere there was no room for further doubt, but much need for vigilance.\r\nAlthough the despatch was not read to the officer, not that his story\r\nwas doubted, but purely for prudential reasons, he was nevertheless\r\ngiven to understand, that it was about the same party, and that they\r\nwould be duly looked after. It would hardly have been understood by the\r\nofficer, had he been permitted to read it so guardedly was it worded, it\r\nwas indeed dead language to all save the initiated. In one particular\r\nespecially, relative to the depot where they were expected to arrive,\r\nthe officer was in the dark, as his despatch pointed to the regular\r\ntrain, and of course to the depot at Eleventh and Market streets. The\r\nUnderground Rail Road despatch on the contrary pointed to Broad and\r\nCallowhill streets \"Via,\" _i.e._ Reading.\r\n\r\nAs notified, that evening the \"four large and two small hams\" arrived,\r\nand turned out to be of the very finest quality, just such as any trader\r\nwould have paid the highest market price for. Being mindful of the great\r\ndanger of the hour, there was felt to be more occasion just then for\r\nanxiety and watchfulness, than for cheering and hurrahing over the brave\r\npassengers. To provide for them in the usual manner, in view of the\r\nthreatening aspect of affairs, could not be thought of. In this critical\r\nhour it devolved upon a member of the Committee, for the safety of all\r\nparties, to find new and separate places of accommodation, especially\r\nfor the six known to be pursued. To be stored in other than private\r\nfamilies would not answer. Three or four such were visited at once;\r\nafter learning of the danger much sympathy was expressed, but one after\r\nanother made excuses and refused. This was painful, for the parties had\r\nplenty of house room, were identified with the oppressed race, and on\r\npublic meeting occasions made loud professions of devotion to the cause\r\nof the fugitive, &c. The memory of the hour and circumstances is still\r\nfresh.\r\n\r\nAccommodations were finally procured for a number of the fugitives with\r\na widow woman, (Ann Laws) whose opportunities for succor were far less\r\nthan at the places where refusals had been met with. But Mrs. L. was\r\nkind-hearted, and nobly manifested a willingness to do all that she\r\ncould for their safety. Of course the Committee felt bound to bear\r\nwhatever expense might necessarily be incurred. Here some of the\r\npassengers were kept for several days, strictly private, long enough to\r\ngive the slave-hunters full opportunity to tire themselves, and give up\r\nthe chase in despair. Some belonging to the former arrivals had also to\r\nbe similarly kept for the same reasons. Through careful management all\r\nwere succored and cared for. Whilst much interesting information was\r\nobtained from these several arrivals: the incidents connected with their\r\nlives in Slavery, and when escaping were but briefly written out. Of\r\nthis fourth arrival, however, the following intelligence will doubtless\r\nbe highly gratifying to the friends of freedom, wherever the labors of\r\nthe Underground Rail Road may be appreciated. The people round about\r\nHagerstown, Maryland, may like to know how these \"articles\" got off so\r\nsuccessfully, the circumstances of their escape having doubtless created\r\nsome excitement in that region of the country.\r\n\r\nArrival No. 4. Charles Bird, George Dorsey, Angeline Brown, Albert\r\nBrown, Charles Brown and Jane Scott.\r\n\r\nCharles was twenty-four years of age, quite dark, of quick motion, and\r\nready speech, and in every way appearing as though he could take care of\r\nhimself. He had occupied the condition of a farm laborer. This calling\r\nhe concluded to forsake, not because he disliked farming, but simply to\r\nget rid of David Clargart, who professed to own him, and compelled him\r\nto work without pay, \"for nothing.\" While Charles spoke favorably of\r\nClargart as a man, to the extent, at all events, of testifying that he\r\nwas not what was called a hard man, nevertheless Charles was so\r\ndecidedly opposed to Slavery that he felt compelled to look out for\r\nhimself. Serving another man on the no pay principle, at the same time\r\nliable to be flogged, and sold at the pleasure of another, Charles felt\r\nwas worse than heathenish viewed in any light whatsoever. He was\r\nprepared therefore, to leave without delay. He had four sisters in the\r\nhands of Clargart, but what could he do for them but leave them to\r\nProvidence.\r\n\r\nThe next on the list was George Dorsey, a comrade of Charles. He was a\r\nyoung man, of medium size, mixed blood, intelligent, and a brave fellow\r\nas will appear presently.\r\n\r\nThis party in order to get over the road as expeditiously as possible,\r\navailed themselves of their master's horses and wagon and moved off\r\ncivilly and respectably. About nine miles from home on the road, a\r\ncouple of white men, finding their carriage broken down approached them,\r\nunceremoniously seized the horses by the reins and were evidently about\r\nto assume authority, supposing that the boys would surrender at once.\r\nBut instead of so doing, the boys struck away at them with all their\r\nmight, with their large clubs, not even waiting to hear what these\r\nsuperior individuals wanted. The effect of the clubs brought them\r\nprostrate in the road, in an attitude resembling two men dreaming, (it\r\nwas in the night.) The victorious passengers, seeing that the smashed up\r\ncarriage could be of no further use to them, quickly conceived the idea\r\nof unhitching and attempting further pursuit on horseback. Each horse\r\nwas required to carry three passengers. So up they mounted and off they\r\ngalloped with the horses' heads turned directly towards Pennsylvania. No\r\nfurther difficulty presented itself until after they had traveled some\r\nforty miles. Here the poor horses broke down, and had to be abandoned.\r\nThe fugitives were hopeful, but of the difficulties ahead they wot not;\r\nsurely no flowery beds of ease awaited them. For one whole week they\r\nwere obliged to fare as they could, out in the woods, over the\r\nmountains, &c. How they overcame the trials in this situation we cannot\r\nundertake to describe. Suffice it to say, at the end of the time above\r\nmentioned they managed to reach Harrisburg and found assistance as\r\nalready intimated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nGeorge and Angeline, (who was his sister) with her two boys had a\r\nconsiderable amount of white blood in their veins, and belonged to a\r\nwealthy man by the name of George Schaeffer, who was in the milling\r\nbusiness. They were of one mind in representing him as a hard man. \"He\r\nwould often threaten to sell, and was very hard to please.\" George and\r\nAngeline left their mother and ten brothers and sisters.\r\n\r\nJane was a well-grown girl, smart, and not bad-looking, with a fine\r\nbrown skin, and was also owned by Schaeffer.\r\n\r\nLetters from the enterprising Charlotte and Harriet (arrival No. 1),\r\nbrought the gratifying intelligence, that they had found good homes in\r\nWestern New York, and valued their freedom highly. Three out of quite a\r\nnumber of letters received from them from time to time are subjoined.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SENNETT, June, 1856.\r\n\r\n    MR. WILLIAM STILL:--_Dear Sir_:--I am happy to tell you that\r\n    Charlotte Gildes and myself have got along thus far safely. We\r\n    have had no trouble and found friends all the way along, for\r\n    which we feel very thankful to you and to all our friends on the\r\n    road since we left. We reached Mr. Loguen's in Syracuse, on last\r\n    Tuesday evening & on Wednesday two gentlemen from this community\r\n    called and we went with them to work in their families. What I\r\n    wish you would do is to be so kind as to send our clothes to\r\n    this place if they should fall into your hands. We hope our\r\n    uncle in Baltimore will get the letter Charlotte wrote to him\r\n    last Sabbath, while we were at your house, concerning the\r\n    clothes. Perhaps the best would be to send them to Syracuse to\r\n    the _care of Mr. Loguen_ and he will send them to us. This will\r\n    more certainly ensure our getting them. If you hear anything\r\n    that would be interesting to Charlotte or me from Baltimore,\r\n    please direct a letter to us to this place, to the care of Revd.\r\n    Chas. Anderson, Sennett, Cayuga Co., N.Y. Please give my love\r\n    and Charlotte's to Mrs. Still and thank her for her kindness to\r\n    us while at your house.\r\n\r\n    Your affectionate friend,\r\n\r\n    HARRIET EGLIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    SENNETT, July 31st, 1856.\r\n\r\n    MR. WM. STILL:--_My Dear Friend_:--I have just received your\r\n    note of 29th inst. and allow me dear sir, to assure you that the\r\n    only letter I have written, is the one you received, an answer\r\n    to which you sent me. I never wrote to Baltimore, nor did any\r\n    person write for me there, and it is with _indescribable grief_,\r\n    that I hear what your letter communicates to me, of those who\r\n    you say have gotten into difficulty on my account. My Cousin\r\n    Charlotte who came with me, got into a good place in this\r\n    vicinity, but she could not content herself to stay here but\r\n    just _one week_--she then went to Canada--and she is the one who\r\n    by writing (if any one), has brought this trouble upon those to\r\n    whom you refer in Baltimore.\r\n\r\n    She has written me two letters from Canada, and by neither of\r\n    them can I ascertain _where she lives_--her letters are mailed\r\n    at Suspension Bridge, but she does not live there as her letters\r\n    show. In the first she does not even sign her name. She has\r\n    evidently employed some person to write, who is nearly as\r\n    ignorant as herself. If I knew where to find her I would find\r\n    out _what_ she has written.\r\n\r\n    I don't know but she has told where I live, and may yet get me\r\n    and my friends here, in trouble too, as she has some in other\r\n    places. I don't wish to have you trouble yourself about my\r\n    clothes, I am in a place where I can get all the clothes I want\r\n    or need. Will you please write me when convenient and tell me\r\n    what you hear about those who I fear are suffering as the result\r\n    of their kindness to me? May God, in some way, grant them\r\n    deliverance. Oh the misery, the sorrow, which this cursed system\r\n    of Slavery is constantly bringing upon millions in this land of\r\n    boasted freedom!\r\n\r\n    Can you tell me where Sarah King is, who was at your house when\r\n    I was there? She was going to Canada to meet her husband. Give\r\n    my love to Mrs. Still & accept the same yourself. Your much\r\n    indebted & obliged friend,\r\n\r\n    HARRIET EGLIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"difficulty\" about which Harriet expressed so much regret in the\r\nabove letter, had reference to a letter supposed to have been written by\r\nher friend Charlotte to Baltimore, about her clothing. It had been\r\nintercepted, and in this way, a clue was obtained by one of the owners\r\nas to how they escaped, who aided them, etc. On the strength of the\r\ninformation thus obtained, a well-known colored man, named Adams, was\r\nstraightway arrested and put in prison at the instance of one of the\r\nowners, and also a suit was at the same time instituted against the Rail\r\nRoad Company for damages--by which steps quite a huge excitement was\r\ncreated in Baltimore. As to the colored man Adams, the prospect looked\r\nsimply hopeless. Many hearts were sad in view of the doom which they\r\nfeared would fall upon him for obeying a humane impulse (he had put the\r\ngirls on the cars). But with the Rail Road Company it was a different\r\nmatter; they had money, power, friends, etc., and could defy the courts.\r\nIn the course of a few months, when the suit against Adams and the Rail\r\nRoad Company came up, the Rail Road Company proved in court, in defense,\r\nthat the prosecutor entered the cars in search of his runaway, and went\r\nand spoke to the two young women in \"mourning\" the day they escaped,\r\nlooking expressly for the identical parties, for which he was seeking\r\ndamages before the court, and that he declared to the conductor, on\r\nleaving the cars, that the said \"two girls in mourning, were not the\r\nones he was looking after,\" or in other words, that \"neither\" belonged\r\nto him. This positive testimony satisfied the jury, and the Rail Road\r\nCompany and poor James Adams escaped by the verdict not guilty. The\r\nowner of the lost property had the costs to pay of course, but whether\r\nhe was made a wiser or better man by the operation was never\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    SENNETT, October 28th, 1856.\r\n\r\n    DEAR MR. STILL:--I am happy to tell you that I am well and\r\n    happy. I still live with Rev. Mr. Anderson in this place, I am\r\n    learning to read and write. I do not like to trouble you too\r\n    much, but I would like to know if you have heard anything more\r\n    about my friends in Baltimore who got into trouble on our\r\n    account. Do be pleased to write me if you can give me any\r\n    information about them. I feel bad that they should suffer for\r\n    me. I wish all my brethren and sisters in bondage, were as well\r\n    off as I am. The girl that came with me is in Canada, near the\r\n    Suspension Bridge. I was glad to see Green Murdock, a colored\r\n    young man, who stopped at your house about six weeks ago, he\r\n    knew my folks at the South. He has got into a good place to work\r\n    in this neighborhood. Give my love to Mrs Still, and believe me\r\n    your obliged friend,\r\n\r\n    HARRIET EGLIN.\r\n\r\n    P.S. I would like to know what became of Johnson,[A] the man\r\n    whose foot was smashed by jumping off the cars, he was at your\r\n    house when I was there.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote A: Johnson was an unfortunate young fugitive, who,\r\n    while escaping, beheld his master or pursuer in the cars, and\r\n    jumped therefrom, crushing his feet shockingly by the bold act.]\r\n\r\n    H.E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM VIRGINIA, MARYLAND, DELAWARE, NORTH CAROLINA, WASHINGTON, D.C., AND\r\nSOUTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\nJAMES BURRELL,  DANIEL WIGGINS, WM. ROBINSON, EDWARD PEADEN, AND WIFE,\r\nALEX BOGGS, SAMUEL STATER, HARRISON BELL AND DAUGHTER, HARRIET\r\nANN,DANIEL DAVIS, _alias_ DAVID SMITH, JAMES STEWART, _alias_ WILLIAM\r\nJACKSON, HARRIET HALEY, _alias_ ANN RICHARDSON, BENJ. DUNCANS, _alias_\r\nGEORGE SCOTT, MOSES WINES, SARAH SMITH, _alias_ MILDRETH PAGE, LUCY\r\nGARRETT, _alias_ JULIA WOOD, ELLEN FORMAN, _alias_ ELIZABETH YOUNG,  WM.\r\nWOODEN, _alias_ WM. NELSON, JAMES EDWARD HANDY, _alias_ DENNIS CANNON,\r\nJAMES HENRY DELANY _alias_ SMART STANLEY, JAMES HENRY BLACKSON, GEORGE\r\nFREELAND, MILES WHITE, LOUISA CLAYTON, LEWIS SNOWDEN, _alias_ LEWIS\r\nWILLIAMS, WM. JOHNSON, JOHN HALL _alias_ JOHN SIMPSON. In order to keep\r\nthis volume within due limits, in the cases to be noticed in this\r\nchapter, it will be impossible to state more than a few of the\r\ninteresting particulars that make up these narratives. While some of\r\nthese passengers might not have been made in the prison house to drink\r\nof the bitter cup as often as others, and in their flight might not have\r\nbeen called upon to pass through as severe perils as fell to the lot of\r\nothers, nevertheless justice seems to require, that, as far as possible,\r\nall the passengers passing over the Philadelphia Underground Rail Road\r\nshall be noticed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Burrell. James was certainly justifiable in making his escape, if\r\nfor no other reason than on the score of being nearly related to the\r\nchivalry of the South. He was a mulatto (the son of a white man\r\nevidently), about thirty-two years of age, medium size, and of an\r\nagreeable appearance. He was owned by a maiden lady, who lived at\r\nWilliamsburg, but not requiring his services in her own family, she\r\nhired him out by the year to a Mr. John Walker, a manufacturer of\r\ntobacco, for which she received $120 annually. This arrangement was not\r\nsatisfactory to James. He could not see why he should be compelled to\r\nwear the yoke like an ox. The more he thought over his condition, the\r\nmore unhappy was his lot, until at last he concluded, that he could not\r\nstand Slavery any longer. He had witnessed a great deal of the hardships\r\nof the system of Slavery, and he had quite enough intelligence to\r\nportray the horrors thereof in very vivid colors. It was the\r\nauction-block horror that first prompted him to seek freedom. While\r\nthinking how he would manage to get away safely, his wife and children\r\nwere ever present in his mind. He felt as a husband should towards his\r\n\"wife Betsy,\" and likewise loved his \"children, Walter and Mary;\" but\r\nthese belonged to another man, who lived some distance in the country,\r\nwhere he had permission to see them only once a week. This had its\r\npleasure, it also had its painful influence. The weekly partings were a\r\nnever-failing source of unhappiness. So when James' mind was fully made\r\nup to escape from Slavery, he decided that it would not be best to break\r\nthe secret to his poor wife and children, but to get off to Canada, and\r\nafterwards to try and see what he could do for their deliverance. The\r\nhour fixed to leave Virginia arrived, and he started and succeeded in\r\nreaching Philadelphia, and the Committee. On arriving he needed\r\nmedicine, clothing, food, and a carriage for his accommodation, all\r\nwhich were furnished freely by the Committee, and he was duly forwarded\r\nto Canada. From Canada, with his name changed, he wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    TORONTO, March 28th, 1854.\r\n\r\n    SIR, MR. STILL--It does me pleasure to forward you this letter\r\n    hopeing when this comes to hand it may find your family well, as\r\n    they leaves me at present. I will also say that the friends are\r\n    well. Allow me to say to you that I arrived in this place on\r\n    Friday last safe and sound, and feeles well under my safe\r\n    arrival. Its true that I have not been employed as yet but I\r\n    lives hopes to be at work very shortly. I likes this city very\r\n    well, and I am in hopes that there a living here for me as much\r\n    so as there for any one else. You will be please to write. I am\r\n    bording at Mr. Phillip's Centre Street.\r\n\r\n    I have nothing more at present. Yours most respectfull.\r\n\r\n    W. BOURAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDANIEL WIGGINS, _alias_ DANIEL ROBINSON. Daniel fled from Norfolk, Va.,\r\nwhere he had been owned by the late Richard Scott. Only a few days\r\nbefore Daniel escaped, his so-called owner was summoned to his last\r\naccount. While ill, just before the close of his career, he often\r\npromised D. his freedom and also promised, if restored, that he would\r\nmake amends for the past, by changing his ways of living. His son, who\r\nwas very reckless, he would frequently allude to and declared, \"that\r\nhe,\" the son, \"should not have his 'property.'\" These dying sentiments\r\nfilled Daniel with great hopes that the day of his enslavement was\r\nnearly at an end. Unfortunately, however, death visited the old master,\r\nere he had made provision for his slaves. At all events, no will was\r\nfound. That he might not fall a prey to the reckless son, he felt, that\r\nhe must nerve himself for a desperate struggle to obtain his freedom in\r\nsome other way, by traveling on the Underground Rail Road. While he had\r\nalways been debarred from book learning, he was, nevertheless, a man of\r\nsome intelligence, and by trade was a practical Corker.\r\n\r\nHe was called upon in this trying hour to leave his wife with three\r\nchildren, but they were, fortunately, free. Coming to the Committee in\r\nwant, they cheerfully aided him, and forwarded him on to Canada. Thence,\r\nimmediately on his arrival, he returned the following grateful letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n    NEW BEDFORD, Mass., March 22d, 1854.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:--I am happy to inform you that I arrived in this place\r\n    this morning well and cheerful. I am, sir, to you and others\r\n    under more obligations for your kindly protection of me than I\r\n    can in any way express at present. May the Lord preserve you\r\n    unto eternal life. Remember my respects to Mr. Lundy and family.\r\n    Should the boat lay up please let me know.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n\r\n    DAVID ROBINSON.\r\n\r\n    Please forward to Dr. H. Lundy, after you have gotten through.\r\n    With respects, &c.\r\n\r\n    D.R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWM. ROBINSON, _alias_ THOS. HARRED. William gave satisfactory evidence,\r\nat first sight, that he was opposed to the unrequited labor system _in\r\ntoto_, and even hated still more the flogging practices of the chivalry.\r\nAlthough he had reached his twenty-eighth year, and was a truly fair\r\nspecimen of his race, considering his opportunities, a few days before\r\nWilliam left, the overseer on the plantation attempted to flog him, but\r\ndid not succeed. William's manhood was aroused, and he flogged the\r\noverseer soundly, if what he averred was true. The name of William's\r\nowner was John G. Beale, Esq., of Fauquier county, Va. Beale was\r\nconsidered to be a man of wealth, and had invested in Slave stock to the\r\nnumber of seventy head. According to William's account of Beale, he was\r\na \"hard man and thought no more of his black people than he did of\r\ndogs.\" When William entered upon the undertaking of freeing himself from\r\nBeale's barbarism, he had but one dollar and twenty-five cents in his\r\npossession; but he had physical strength and a determined mind, and\r\nbeing heartily sick of Slavery, he was willing to make the trial, even\r\nat the cost of life. Thus hopeful, he prosecuted his journey with\r\nsuccess through strange regions of country, with but little aid or\r\nencouragement before reaching Philadelphia. This feat, however, was not\r\nperformed without getting lost by the way. On arriving, his shoes were\r\ngone, and his feet were severely travel-worn. The Committee rendered\r\nneeded aid, etc., and sent William on to Canada to work for himself, and\r\nto be recognized as a subject of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD PEADEN AND WIFE HARRIET, AND SISTER CELIA. This man and his wife\r\nand wife's sister were a nice-looking trio, but they brought quite a sad\r\nstory with them: the sale of their children, six in number. The auction\r\nblock had made such sad havoc among them, that no room was left to hope,\r\nthat their situation would ever be improved by remaining. Indeed they\r\nhad been under a very gloomy cloud for some time previous to leaving,\r\nfearing that the auction block was shortly to be their doom. To escape\r\nthis fate, they were constrained to \"secrete themselves for one month,\"\r\nuntil an opportunity offered them to secure a passage on a boat coming\r\nto Philadelphia. Edward (the husband), was about forty-four years of\r\nage, of a dark color, well made, full face, pleasant countenance, and\r\ntalked fluently. Dr. Price claimed him as his personal property, and\r\nexacted all his hire and labor. For twelve years he had been hired out\r\nfor $100 per annum. Harriet, the wife of Edward, belonged to David\r\nBaines, of Norfolk. Her general appearance indicated, that nature had\r\nfavored her physically and mentally, although being subjected to the\r\ndrudgery of Slave life, with no advantages for development, she was\r\nsimply a living testimony to the crushing influence of Slavery--with a\r\nheart never free from the saddened recollection of the auction block, on\r\nwhich all of her children had been sacrificed, \"one by one.\" Celia, the\r\nsister, also belonged to D. Baines, and was kept hired out--was last in\r\nthe service of the Mayor of Norfolk. Of her story nothing of any moment\r\nwas recorded. On their arrival in Philadelphia, as usual they were\r\nhanded over to the Committee, and their wants were met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM DAVIS. All that the records contain of William is as follows: He\r\nleft Emmitsburg, Md., the previous Friday night, where he had been held\r\nby Dr. James Shoul. William is thirty-two years of age, dark color,\r\nrather below medium stature. With regard to his slave life, he declared\r\nthat he had been \"roughly used.\" Besides, for some time before escaping,\r\nhe felt that his owner was in the \"notion of trading\" him off. The fear\r\nthat this apprehended notion would be carried into execution, was what\r\nprompted him to leave his master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER BOGGS, alias JOHNSON HENSON. This subject was under the\r\nownership of a certain John Ernie, who lived about three miles from\r\nBaltimore. Mr. Ernie had only been in possession of the wayward\r\nAlexander three weeks, having purchased him of a trader named Dennit,\r\nfor $550. This was not the first time, however, that he had experienced\r\nthe trouble of changing masters, in consequence of having been sold.\r\nPreviously to his being disposed of by the trader Dennit, he had been\r\nowned by Senator Merrick, who had the misfortune to fail in business, in\r\nconsequence whereof, his slaves had all to be sold and Alexander with\r\nthe rest, away from his wife, Caroline, and two children, James and\r\nEliezer.\r\n\r\nThis was a case that appealed for sympathy and aid, which were\r\ncheerfully rendered by the Committee. Alexander was about fifty years of\r\nage, of dark color. On the Records no account of cruel treatment is\r\nfound, other than being sold, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN BROWN, alias JACOB WILLIAMS, arrived from Fredericktown, Md., where\r\nhe had been working under the yoke of Joseph Postly. John was a young\r\nman of twenty-nine years of age. Up to the hour of his escape, his lot\r\nhad been that of an ordinary slave. Indeed, he had much less to complain\r\nof with reference to usage than most slaves; the only thing in this\r\nrespect the records contain, is simply a charge, that his master\r\nthreatened to sell him. But this did not seem to have been the motive\r\nwhich prompted John to take leave of his master. Although untutored, he\r\nhad mind enough to comprehend that Postly had no right to oppress him,\r\nand wrong him out of his hire. John concluded that he would not stand\r\nsuch treatment any longer, and made up his mind to leave for Canada.\r\nAfter due examination the Committee, finding his story reasonable, gave\r\nhim the usual assistance, advice and instruction, and sent him on\r\nCanada-ward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL SLATER, alias PATTERSON SMITH, came from a place called Power\r\nBridge, Md. He gave a satisfactory account of himself, and was commended\r\nfor having wisely left his master, William Martin, to earn his bread by\r\nthe sweat of his own brow. Martin had held up the vision of the\r\nauction-block before Sam; this was enough. Sam saw that it was time for\r\nhim to be getting out of danger's way without delay, so he presumed, if\r\nothers could manage to escape, he could too. And he succeeded. He was a\r\nstout man, about twenty-nine years of age, of dark complexion. No\r\nparticular mention of ill treatment is found on the Records.\r\n\r\nAfter arriving in Canada, his heart turned with deep interest and\r\naffection to those left in the prison-house, as the following letter\r\nindicates.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ST. CATHRINES Oct 29th.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR FRIEND:--yours of the 15th came to hand and I was glad\r\n    to hea from you and your dear family were well and the reason\r\n    that I did not write sooner I expected get a letter from my\r\n    brother in pennsylvania but I have not received any as yet when\r\n    I wrote last I directed my letter to philip scott minister of\r\n    the asbury church baltimore and that was the reason that I\r\n    thought it strange I did not get an answer but I did not put my\r\n    brother name to it I made arrangements before I left home with a\r\n    family of smiths that I was to write to and the letter that I\r\n    enclose in this I want you to direct it to D Philip scott in his\r\n    care for mrs cassey Jackson Duke Jacksons wife and she will give\r\n    to Priana smith or Sarah Jane Smith those are the persons I wish\r\n    to write to I wish you to write on as quick as you can and let\r\n    them know that there is a lady coming on by the name of mrs\r\n    Holonsworth and she will call and see you and you will find her\r\n    a very interesting and inteligent person one worthy of respect\r\n    and esteem and a high reputation I must now bring my letter to a\r\n    close no more at present but remain your humble servant\r\n\r\n    PATTERSON SMITH\r\n\r\n    In my letters I did not write to my friends how they shall write\r\n    to me but in the letter that you write you will please to tell\r\n    them how they shall write to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARRISON BELL AND DAUGHTER HARRIET ANN. Father and daughter were\r\nfortunate enough to escape together from Norfolk, Va.\r\n\r\nHarrison was just in the prime of life, forty years of age, stout made,\r\ngood features, but in height was rather below medium, was a man of more\r\nthan ordinary shrewdness, by trade he was a chandler. He alleged that he\r\nhad been used hard.\r\n\r\nHarriet Ann was a well-grown girl of pleasant appearance, fourteen years\r\nof age. Father and daughter had each different owners, one belonged to\r\nJames Snyder, the other to John G. Hodgson.\r\n\r\nHarrison had been informed that his children were to be sold; to prevent\r\nthis shocking fate, he was prompted to escape. Several months previous\r\nto finding a chance to make a safe flight, he secreted himself with his\r\nchildren in Norfolk, and so remained up to the day he left, a passage\r\nhaving been secured for them on one of the boats coming to Philadelphia.\r\nWhile the records contain no definite account of other children, it is\r\nevident that there were others, but what became of them is not known.\r\n\r\nIf at the time of their arrival, it had been imagined that the glorious\r\nday of universal freedom was only about eight years off, doubtless much\r\nfuller records would have been made of these struggling Underground Rail\r\nRoad passengers. If Harrison's relatives and friends, who suddenly\r\nmissed him and his daughter Harriet Ann, in the Spring of 1854, are\r\nstill ignorant of his whereabouts, this very brief account of their\r\narrival in Philadelphia, may be of some satisfaction to all concerned,\r\nnot excepting his old master, whom he had served so faithfully.\r\n\r\nThe Committee finding them in need, had the pleasure of furnishing them\r\nwith food, material aid and a carriage, with cheering words and letters\r\nof introduction to friends on the road to Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDANIEL DAVIS, ALIAS DAVID SMITH, ADAM NICHOLSON, ALIAS JOHN WYNKOOP,\r\nREUBEN BOWLES, ALIAS CUNNIGAN, ARRIVED FROM HEDGEVILLE, VA.\r\n\r\nDaniel was only about twenty, just at a capital age to make a bold\r\nstrike for freedom. The appearance and air of this young aspirant for\r\nliberty indicated that he was not of the material to be held in chains.\r\nHe was a man of medium size, well-built, dark color, and intelligent.\r\nHon. Charles J. Fortner, M.C. was the reputed owner of this young\r\nfugitive, but the honorable gentleman having no use for his services, or\r\nbecause he may have profited more by hiring him out, Daniel was placed\r\nin the employ of a farmer, by the name of Adam Quigley. It was at this\r\ntime he resolved that he would not be a slave any longer. He declared\r\nthat Quigley was a \"very mean man,\" one for whom he had no respect\r\nwhatever. Indeed he felt that the system of Slavery was an abomination\r\nin any form it might be viewed. While he was yet so young, he had pretty\r\nclear views with regard to Slavery, and remembered with feelings of deep\r\nindignation, how his father had been sold when he himself was a boy,\r\njust as a horse might have been sold; and how his mother was dragging\r\nher chains in Slavery, up to the hour he fled. Thus in company with his\r\ntwo companions he was prepared for any sacrifice.\r\n\r\nAdam'S tale is soon told; all that is on the old record in addition to\r\nhis full name, is in the following words: \"Adam is dark, rugged and\r\nsensible, and was owned by Alexander Hill, a drunkard, gambler, &c.\"\r\n\r\nReuben had been hired out to John Sabbard near Hedgeville. Startled at\r\nhearing that he was to be sold, he was led to consider the propriety of\r\nseeking flight via the Underground Rail Road. These three young men were\r\nall fine specimens of farm hands, and possessed more than average common\r\nsense, considering the oppression they had to labor under. They walked\r\nthe entire distance from Hedgeville, Va., to Greenville, Pa. There they\r\ntook the cars and walked no more. They appeared travel-worn, garments\r\ndirty, and forlorn; but the Committee had them cleanly washed, hair cut\r\nand shaved, change of clothing furnished, &c., which at once made them\r\nlook like very different men. Means were appropriated to send them on\r\nfree of cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES STEWART, _alias_ WM. JACKSON. James had been made acquainted with\r\nthe Peculiar Institution in Fauquier county, Va. Being of sound judgment\r\nand firm resolution, he became an enemy to Slavery at a very early age;\r\nso much so, that by the time he was twenty-one he was willing to put\r\ninto practice his views of the system by leaving it and going where all\r\nmen are free. Very different indeed were these notions, from those held\r\nby his owner, Wm. Rose, who believed in Slavery for the black man. So as\r\nJames could neither enjoy his freedom nor express his opinion in\r\nVirginia, he determined, that he had better get a passage on the\r\nUnderground Rail Road, and leave the land of Slavery and the obnoxious\r\nsentiments of his master. He, of course, saw formidable difficulties to\r\nbe encountered all the way along in escaping, but these, he considered,\r\nwould be more easy for him to overcome than it would be for him to learn\r\nthe lesson--\"Servants, obey your masters.\" The very idea made James\r\nsick. This, therefore, was the secret of his escape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARRIET HALEY, _alias_ ANN RICHARDSON, AND ELIZABETH HALEY, _alias_\r\nSARAH RICHARDSON. These travelers succeeded in escaping from Geo. C.\r\nDavis, of Harford county, Md. In order to carry out their plans, they\r\ntook advantage of Whitsuntide, a holiday, and with marked ingenuity and\r\nperseverance, they managed to escape and reach Quakertown Underground\r\nRail Road Station without obstruction, where protection and assistance\r\nwere rendered by the friends of the cause. After abiding there for a\r\nshort time, they were forwarded to the Committee in Philadelphia. Their\r\nages ranged from nineteen to twenty-one, and they were apparently\r\n\"servants\" of a very superior order. The pleasure it afforded to aid\r\nsuch young women in escaping from a condition so loathsome as that of\r\nSlavery in Maryland, was unalloyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN DUNCANS, _alias_ GEORGE SCOTT. This individual was in bonds\r\nunder Thomas Jeffries, who was a firm believer in the doctrine:\r\n\"Servants, obey your masters,\" and, furthermore, while laboring \"pretty\r\nhard\" to make Benjamin a convert to this idea, he had made Benjamin's\r\nlot anything else than smooth. This treatment on the part of the master\r\nmade a wise and resolute man of the Slave. For as he looked earnestly\r\ninto the fact, that he was only regarded by his owner in the light of an\r\nox, or an ass, his manhood rebelled straightway, and the true light of\r\nfreedom told him, that he must be willing to labor, and endure suffering\r\nfor the great prize, liberty. So, in company with five others, at an\r\nappointed time, he set out for freedom, and succeeded. The others,\r\nalluded to, passed on to Canada direct. Benjamin was induced to stop a\r\nfew months in Pennsylvania, during which time he occupied himself in\r\nfarming. He looked as if he was well able to do a full day's work at\r\nthis occupation. He was about twenty-five years of age, of unmixed\r\nblood, and wore a pleasant countenance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOSES WINES. Portsmouth, Va., lost one of her most substantial laborers\r\nin the person of Moses, and Madam Abigail Wheeler, a very \"likely\r\narticle\" of merchandise. \"No complaint\" as to \"ill treatment\" was made\r\nby Moses against \"Miss Abigail.\" The truth was, he admitted, that he had\r\nbeen used in a \"mild way.\" With some degree of pride, he stated that he\r\n\"had never been flogged.\" But, for the \"last fifteen years, he had been\r\nfavored with the exalted privilege of 'hiring' his time at the\r\n'reasonable' sum of $12 per month.\" As he stood pledged to have this\r\namount always ready, \"whether sick or well,\" at the end of the month,\r\nhis mistress \"never neglected to be in readiness to receive it\" to the\r\nlast cent. In this way Moses was taught to be exceedingly punctual. Who\r\nwould not commend such a mistress for the punctuality, if nothing more?\r\nBut as smoothly as matters seemed to be going along, the mischievous\r\nidea crept into Moses' head, that he ought to have some of the money\r\nclaimed by his \"kind\" mistress, and at the same time, the thought would\r\noften forcibly press upon his mind that he might any day be sold. In\r\naddition to this unpleasant prospect, Virginia had just about that time\r\npassed a law \"prohibiting Slaves from hiring their time\"--also, a number\r\nof \"new Police rules with reference to Slaves and free colored people,\"\r\nall of which, the \"humane Slave-holders\" of that \"liberal State,\"\r\nregarded as highly essential both for the \"protection and safety of\r\nMaster and Slave.\" But the stupid-headed Moses was not pleased with\r\nthese arrangements. In common with many of the Slaves, he smarted\r\nseverely under his heavy oppression, and felt that it was similar to an\r\nold rule, which had been once tried under Pharaoh--namely, when the\r\nchildren of Israel were required to \"make bricks without straw.\" But\r\nMoses was not a fit subject to submit to be ruled so inhumanly.\r\n\r\nDespite the beautiful sermons he had often listened to in favor of\r\nSlavery, and the many wise laws, above alluded to, he could not\r\nreconcile himself to his condition. The laws and preaching were alike as\r\n\"sounding brass, and tinkling cymbals\" to him. He made up his mind,\r\ntherefore, that he must try a free country; that his manhood required\r\nhim to make the effort at once, even at the risk of life. Father and\r\nhusband, as he was, and loving his wife, Grace, and son, Alphonso,\r\ntenderly as he did, he nevertheless felt himself to be in chains, and\r\nthat he could do but little for them by remaining. He conceived that, if\r\nhe could succeed in gaining his freedom, he might possibly aid them away\r\nalso. With this hope in him, he contrived to secure a private passage on\r\nthe steamship City of Richmond, and in this way reached Philadelphia,\r\nbut not without suffering fearfully the entire journey through, owing to\r\nthe narrowness of the space into which he was obliged to be stowed in\r\norder to get away.\r\n\r\nMoses was a man of medium size, quite dark, and gave promise of being\r\ncapable of taking care of himself in freedom. He had seen much of the\r\ncruelties of Slavery inflicted upon others in various forms, which he\r\nrelated in a way to make one shudder; but these incidents were not\r\nrecorded in the book at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSARAH SMITH, alias MILDRETH PAGE, and her daughter, nine years of age.\r\nSarah and her child were held to service by the Rev. A.D. Pollock, a\r\nresident of Wilmington, Del. Until about nine months before she escaped\r\nfrom the Reverend gentleman, she was owned by Mrs. Elizabeth Lee of\r\nFauquier Co., Va., who had moved with Sarah to Wilmington. How Mr.\r\nPollock came by Sarah is not stated on the records; perhaps by marriage;\r\nbe that as it may, it was owing to ill treatment from her mistress that\r\nSarah \"took out\" with her child. Sarah was a woman of becoming manners,\r\nof a dark brown complexion, and looked as though she might do a fair\r\nshare of housework, if treated well. As it required no great effort to\r\nescape from Wilmington, where the watchful Garrett lived, she reached\r\nthe Committee in Philadelphia without much difficulty, received\r\nassistance and was sent on her way rejoicing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLUCY GARRETT, alias JULIA WOOD. John Williams, who was said to be a\r\n\"very cruel man,\" residing on the Western Shore of Va., claimed Lucy as\r\nhis chattel personal. Julia, having a lively sense of his meanness stood\r\nmuch in fear of being sold; having seen her father, three sisters, and\r\ntwo brothers, disposed of at auction, she was daily on the look-out for\r\nher turn to come next. The good spirit of freedom made the way plain to\r\nher by which an escape could be effected. Being about nineteen years of\r\nage, she felt that she had served in Slavery long enough. She resolved\r\nto start immediately, and did so, and succeeded in reaching\r\nPennsylvania. Her appearance recommended her so well, that she was\r\nprevailed upon to remain and accept a situation in the family of Joseph\r\nA. Dugdale, so well known in reformatory circles, as an ardent friend of\r\nhumanity. While in his family she gave great satisfaction, and was much\r\nesteemed for uprightness and industry. But this place was not Canada,\r\nso, when it was deemed best, she was sent on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELLEN FORMAN, alias ELIZABETH YOUNG. Ellen had formerly been owned by\r\nDr. Thomas, of the Eastern Shore of Maryland, but about one year before\r\nescaping, she was bought by a lady living in Baltimore known by the name\r\nof Mrs. Johnson. Ellen was about thirty years of age, of slender\r\nstature, and of a dark brown complexion. The record makes no mention of\r\ncruel treatment or very hard usage, as a slave. From traveling,\r\nprobably, she had contracted a very heavy cold, which threatened her\r\nwith consumption. The Committee cheerfully rendered her assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM WOODEN, alias WILLIAM NELSON. While Delaware was not far from\r\nfreedom, and while Slavery was considered to exist there comparatively\r\nin a mild form, nevertheless, what with the impenetrable ignorance in\r\nwhich it was the wont of pro-slavery whites to keep the slaves, and the\r\nunwillingness on the part of slave-holders generally to conform to the\r\nspirit of progress going on in the adjacent State of Pennsylvania, it\r\nwas wonderful how the slaves saw through the thick darkness thus\r\nprevailing, and how wide-awake they were to escape.\r\n\r\nIt was from this State, that William Wooden fled. True, William was said\r\nto belong to Judge Wooden, of Georgetown, Del., but, according to the\r\nstory of his \"chattel,\" the Judge was not of the class who judged\r\nrighteously. He had not only treated William badly, but he had\r\nthreatened to sell him. This was the bitter pill which constrained\r\nWilliam to \"take out.\" The threat seemed hard at first, but its effect\r\nwas excellent for this young man; it was the cause of his obtaining his\r\nfreedom at the age of twenty-three. William was a tall, well-built man,\r\nof dark complexion and promising. No further particulars concerning him\r\nare on the records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES EDWARD HANDY, _alias_ DANIEL CANON. At Seaford, Delaware, James\r\nwas held in bonds under a Slave-holder called Samuel Lewis, who followed\r\nfarming. Lewis was not satisfied with working James hard and keeping all\r\nhis earnings, but would insolently talk occasionally of handing him\r\n\"over to the trader.\" This \"stirred James' blood\" and aroused his\r\ncourage to the \"sticking point.\" Nothing could induce him to remain. He\r\nhad the name of having a wife and four children, but according to the\r\nLaws of Delaware, he only had a nominal right in them. They were\r\n\"legally the property of Capt. Martin.\" Therefore they were all left in\r\nthe hands of Capt. Martin. The wife's name was Harriet Delaney, _alias_\r\nSmart Stanley. James Henry Delaney came as a fellow-traveler with James\r\nEdward. He had experienced oppression under Capt. Martin, and as a\r\nwitness, was prepared to testify, that Martin \"ill-treated his Slaves,\r\nespecially with regard to the diet, which was very poor.\" Nevertheless\r\nJames was a stout, heavy-built young man of twenty-six years of age, and\r\nlooked as if he might have a great deal of valuable work in him. He was\r\na single man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES HENRY BLACKSON. James Henry had only reached twenty-five, when he\r\ncame to the \"conclusion, that he had served long enough under bondage\r\nfor the benefit of Charles Wright.\" This was about all of the excuse he\r\nseemed to have for escaping. He was a fine specimen of a man, so far as\r\nphysical strength and muscular power were concerned. Very little was\r\nrecorded of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE FREELAND. It was only by the most indomitable resolution and\r\nperseverance, that Freeland threw off the yoke. Capt. John Pollard of\r\nPetersburg, Va., held George to service. As a Slave-holder, Pollard\r\nbelonged to that class, who did not believe in granting favors to\r\nSlaves. On the contrary, he was practically in favor of wringing every\r\ndrop of blood from their bodies.\r\n\r\nGeorge was a spare-built man, about twenty-five years of age, quite\r\ndark, but had considerable intelligence. He could read and write very\r\nwell, but how he acquired these arts is not known. In testifying against\r\nhis master, George used very strong language. He declared that Pollard\r\n\"thought no more of his servants than if they had been dogs. He was very\r\nmean. He gave nothing to his servants. He has given me only one pair of\r\nshoes the last ten years.\" After careful inquiry, George learned that he\r\ncould get a private passage on the City of Richmond, if he could raise\r\nthe passage money. This he could do cheerfully. He raised \"sixty\r\ndollars\" for the individual who was to \"secrete him on the boat.\" In\r\nleaving the land of Slave auctions, whips and chains, he was obliged to\r\nleave his mother and father and two brothers in Petersburg. Pollard had\r\nbeen offered $1,500 for George. Doubtless he found, when he discovered\r\nGeorge had gone, that he had \"overstood the market.\" This was what\r\nproduced action prompt and decisive on the part of George. So the old\r\nadage, in this case, was verified--\"It's an ill wind that blows nobody\r\nany good.\"\r\n\r\nOn arriving in Canada, George did not forget to express gratitude to\r\nthose who aided him on his road there, as the following note will show:\r\n\r\n\r\n    SINCATHANS, canada west.\r\n\r\n    Brother Still:--I im brace this opportunity of pening you a few\r\n    lines to in form you that I am well at present & in hopes to\r\n    find you & family well also I hope that god Will Bless you & and\r\n    your family & if I never should meet you in this world I hope to\r\n    meet you in glory  Remember my love to Brother Brown & tell him\r\n    that I am well & hearty tell him to writ Thomas word that I am\r\n    well at present you must excuse me I will Rite when I return\r\n    from the west.\r\n\r\n    GEORGE W. FREELAND\r\n\r\n    Send your Letters in the name of John Anderson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMILES WHITE. This passenger owed service to Albert Kern, of Elizabeth\r\nCity, N.C. At least Kern, through the oppressive laws of that State,\r\nclaimed Miles as his personal property. Miles, however, thought\r\ndifferently, but he was not at liberty to argue the case with Kern; for\r\non the \"side of the oppressor there was strength.\" So he resolved, that\r\nhe would adopt the Underground Rail Road plan. As he was only about\r\ntwenty-one years of age, he found it much easier to close his affairs\r\nwith North Carolina, than it would have been had he been encumbered with\r\na family. In fact, the only serious difficulty he had to surmount was to\r\nfind a captain with whom he could secure a safe passage North. To his\r\ngratification it was not long before his efforts in this direction were\r\ncrowned with success. A vessel was being loaded with shingles, the\r\ncaptain of which was kind enough to allow Miles to occupy a very secure\r\nhiding-place thereon. In course of time, having suffered to the extent\r\nusual when so closely conveyed, he arrived in Philadelphia, and being\r\naided, was duly forwarded by the Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN HALL, _alias_ JOHN SIMPSON. John fled from South Carolina. In this\r\nhot-bed of Slavery he labored and suffered up to the age of thirty-two.\r\nFor a length of time before he escaped, his burdens were intolerable;\r\nbut he could see no way to rid himself of them, except by flight. Nor\r\nwas he by any means certain that an effort in this direction would prove\r\nsuccessful. In planning the route which he should take to travel North\r\nhe decided, that if success was for him, his best chance would be to\r\nwend his way through North Carolina and Virginia. Not that he hoped to\r\nfind friends or helpers in these States. He had heard enough of the\r\ncruelties of Slavery in these regions to convince him, that if he should\r\nbe caught, there would be no sympathy or mercy shown. Nevertheless the\r\nirons were piercing him so severely, that he felt constrained to try his\r\nluck, let the consequences be what they might, and so he set out for\r\nfreedom or death. Mountains of difficulties, and months of suffering and\r\nprivations by land and water, in the woods, and swamps of North Carolina\r\nand Virginia, were before him, as his experience in traveling proved.\r\nBut the hope of final victory and his daily sufferings before he\r\nstarted, kept him from faltering, even when starvation and death seemed\r\nto be staring him in the face. For several months he was living in dens\r\nand caves of the earth.\r\n\r\nUltimately, however, the morning of his ardent hopes dawned. How he\r\nsucceeded in finding a captain who was kind enough to afford him a\r\nsecret hiding-place on his boat, was not noted on the records. Indeed\r\nthe incidents of his story were but briefly written out. Similar cases\r\nof thrilling interest seemed almost incredible, and the Committee were\r\nconstrained to doubt the story altogether until other testimony could be\r\nobtained to verify the statement. In this instance, before the Committee\r\nwere fully satisfied, they felt it necessary to make inquiry of\r\ntrustworthy Charlestonians to ascertain if John were really from\r\nCharleston, and if he were actually owned by the man that he represented\r\nas having owned him, Dr. Philip Mazyck, by name; and furthermore, to\r\nlearn if the master was really of the brutal character given him. The\r\ntestimony of thoroughly reliable persons, who were acquainted with\r\nmaster and slave, so far as this man's bondage in Charleston was\r\nconcerned, fully corroborated his statement, and the Committee could not\r\nbut credit his story; indeed they were convinced, that he had been one\r\nof the greatest of sufferers and the chief of heroes. Nevertheless his\r\nstory was not written out, and can only be hinted at. Perhaps more time\r\nwas consumed in its investigation and in listening to a recital of his\r\nsufferings than could well be spared; perhaps it was thought, as was\r\noften the case, unless full justice could be given him, the story would\r\nbe spoiled; or perhaps the appalling nature of his sufferings rendered\r\nthe pen powerless, and made the heart too sick for the task. Whether it\r\nwas so or not in this case, it was not unfrequently so in other\r\ninstances, as is well remembered. It will be necessary, in the\r\nsubsequent pages of this work, to omit the narratives of a great many\r\nwho, unfortunately, were but briefly noted on the books at the time of\r\ntheir arrival. In the eyes of some, this may prove disappointing,\r\nespecially in instances where these pages are turned to with the hope of\r\ngaining a clue to certain lost ones. As all, however, cannot be\r\nmentioned, and as the general reader will look for incidents and facts\r\nwhich will most fittingly bring out the chief characteristics in the\r\ncareer and escape of bondmen, the reasonableness of this course must be\r\nobvious to all.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES GILBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLEEING FROM DAVIS A NEGRO TRADER, SECRETED UNDER A HOTEL, UP A TREE,\r\nUNDER A FLOOR, IN A THICKET, ON A STEAMER. In 1854 Charles was owned in\r\nthe city of Richmond by Benjamin Davis, a notorious negro trader.\r\nCharles was quite a \"likely-looking article,\" not too black or too\r\nwhite, but rather of a nice \"ginger-bread color.\" Davis was of opinion\r\nthat this \"article\" must bring him a tip-top price. For two or three\r\nmonths the trader advertised Charles for sale in the papers, but for\r\nsome reason or other Charles did not command the high price demanded.\r\n\r\nWhile Davis was thus daily trying to sell Charles, Charles was\r\ncontemplating how he might escape. Being uncommonly shrewd he learned\r\nsomething about a captain of a schooner from Boston, and determined to\r\napproach him with regard to securing a passage. The captain manifested a\r\ndisposition to accommodate him for the sum of ten dollars, provided\r\nCharles could manage to get to Old Point Comfort, there to embark. The\r\nPoint was about one hundred and sixty miles distant from Richmond.\r\n\r\nA man of ordinary nerve would have declined this condition\r\nunhesitatingly. On the other hand it was not Charles' intention to let\r\nany offer slide; indeed he felt that he must make an effort, if he\r\nfailed. He could not see how his lot could be made more miserable by\r\nattempting to flee. In full view of all the consequences he ventured to\r\ntake the hazardous step, and to his great satisfaction he reached Old\r\nPoint Comfort safely. In that locality he was well known, unfortunately\r\ntoo well known, for he had been raised partly there, and, at the same\r\ntime, many of his relatives and acquaintances were still living there.\r\nThese facts were evidently well known to the trader, who unquestionably\r\nhad snares set in order to entrap Charles should he seek shelter among\r\nhis relatives, a reasonable supposition. Charles had scarcely reached\r\nhis old home before he was apprised of the fact that the hunters and\r\nwatch dogs of Slavery were eagerly watching for him. Even his nearest\r\nrelatives, through fear of consequences had to hide their faces as it\r\nwere from him. None dare offer him a night's lodging, scarcely a cup of\r\nwater, lest such an act might be discovered by the hunters, whose\r\nfiendish hearts would have found pleasure in meting out the most dire\r\npunishments to those guilty of thus violating the laws of Slavery. The\r\nprospect, if not utterly hopeless, was decidedly discouraging. The way\r\nto Boston was entirely closed. A \"reward of $200\" was advertised for his\r\ncapture. For the first week after arriving at Old Point he entrusted\r\nhimself to a young friend by the name of E.S. The fear of the pursuers\r\ndrove him from his hiding-place at the expiration of the week. Thence he\r\nsought shelter neither with kinfolks, Christians, nor infidels, but in\r\nthis hour of his calamity he made up his mind that he would try living\r\nunder a large hotel for a while. Having watched his opportunity, he\r\nmanaged to reach Higee hotel, a very large house without a cellar,\r\nerected on pillars three or four feet above the ground. One place alone,\r\nnear the cistern, presented some chance for a hiding-place, sufficient\r\nto satisfy him quite well under the circumstances. This dark and gloomy\r\nspot he at once willingly occupied rather than return to Slavery. In\r\nthis refuge he remained four weeks. Of course he could not live without\r\nfood; but to communicate with man or woman would inevitably subject him\r\nto danger. Charles' experience in the neighborhood of his old home left\r\nno ground for him to hope that he would be likely to find friendly aid\r\nanywhere under the shadow of Slavery. In consequence of these fears he\r\nreceived his food from the \"slop tub,\" securing this diet in the\r\ndarkness of night after all was still and quiet around the hotel. To use\r\nhis own language, the meals thus obtained were often \"sweet\" to his\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nOne evening, however, he was not a little alarmed by the approach of an\r\nIrish boy who came under the hotel to hunt chickens. While prowling\r\naround in the darkness he appeared to be making his way unconsciously to\r\nthe very spot where Charles was reposing. How to meet the danger was to\r\nCharles' mind at first very puzzling, there was no time now to plan. As\r\nquick as thought he feigned the bark of a savage dog accompanied with a\r\nfurious growl and snarl which he was confident would frighten the boy\r\nhalf out of his senses, and cause him to depart quickly from his private\r\napartment. The trick succeeded admirably, and the emergency was\r\nsatisfactorily met, so far as the boy was concerned, but the boy's\r\nfather hearing the attack of the dog, swore that he would kill him.\r\nCharles was a silent listener to the threat, and he saw that he could no\r\nlonger remain in safety in his present quarter. So that night he took\r\nhis departure for Bay Shore; here he decided to pass a day in the woods,\r\nbut the privacy of this place was not altogether satisfactory to\r\nCharles' mind; but where to find a more secure retreat he could\r\nnot,--dared not venture to ascertain that day. It occurred to him,\r\nhowever, that he would be much safer up a tree than hid in the bushes\r\nand undergrowth. He therefore climbed up a large acorn tree and there\r\npassed an entire day in deep meditation.  No gleam of hope appeared, yet\r\nhe would not suffer himself to think of returning to bondage. In this\r\ndilemma he remembered a poor washer-woman named Isabella, a slave who\r\nhad charge of a wash-house. With her he resolved to seek succor. Leaving\r\nthe woods he proceeded to the wash-house and was kindly received by\r\nIsabella, but what to do with him or how to afford him any protection\r\nshe could see no way whatever. The schooling which Charles had been\r\nreceiving a number of weeks in connection with the most fearful\r\nlooking-for of the threatened wrath of the trader made it much easier\r\nfor him than for her to see how he could be provided for. A room and\r\ncomforts he was not accustomed to. Of course he could not expect such\r\ncomforts now. Like many another escaping from the relentless tyrant,\r\nCharles could contrive methods which to his venturesome mind would\r\nafford hope, however desperate they might appear to others. He thought\r\nthat he might be safe under the floor. To Isabella the idea was new, but\r\nher sympathies were strongly with Charles, and she readily consented to\r\naccommodate him under the floor of the wash-house. Isabella and a friend\r\nof Charles, by the name of John Thomas, were the only persons who were\r\ncognizant of this arrangement. The kindness of these friends, manifested\r\nby their willingness to do anything in their power to add to the comfort\r\nof Charles, was proof to him that his efforts and sufferings had not\r\nbeen altogether in vain. He remained under the floor two weeks,\r\naccessible to kind voices and friendly ministrations. At the end of this\r\ntime his repose was again sorely disturbed by reports from without that\r\nsuspicion had been awakened towards the wash-house. How this happened\r\nneither Charles nor his friends could conjecture. But the arrival of six\r\nofficers whom he could hear talking very plainly in the house, whose\r\nerrand was actually to search for him, convinced him that he had never\r\nfor a single moment been in greater danger. The officers not only\r\nsearched the house, but they offered his friend John Thomas $25 if he\r\nwould only put them on Charles' track. John professed to know nothing;\r\nIsabella was equally ignorant. Discouraged with their efforts on this\r\noccasion, the officers gave up the hunt and left the house. Charles,\r\nhowever, had had enough of the floor accommodations. He left that night\r\nand returned to his old quarters under the hotel. Here he stayed one\r\nweek, at the expiration of which time the need of fresh air was so\r\nimperative, that he resolved to go out at night to Allen's cottage and\r\nspend a day in the woods. He had knowledge of a place where the\r\nundergrowth and bushes were almost impenetrable. To rest and refresh\r\nhimself in this thicket he felt would be a great comfort to him. Without\r\nserious difficulty he reached the thicket, and while pondering over the\r\nall-absorbing matter as to how he should ever manage to make his escape,\r\nan old man approached. Now while Charles had no reason to think that he\r\nwas sought by the old intruder, his very near approach admonished him\r\nthat it would neither be safe nor agreeable to allow him to come nearer.\r\nCharles remembering that his trick of playing the dog, when previously\r\nin danger under the hotel, had served a good end, thought that it would\r\nwork well in the thicket. So he again tried his power at growling and\r\nbarking hideously for a moment or two, which at once caused the man to\r\nturn his course. Charles could hear him distinctly retreating, and at\r\nthe same time cursing the dog. The owner of the place had the reputation\r\nof keeping \"bad dogs,\" so the old man poured out a dreadful threat\r\nagainst \"Stephens' dogs,\" and was soon out of the reach of the one in\r\nthe thicket.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his success in frightening off the old man, CHARLES felt\r\nthat the thicket was by no means a safe place for him. He concluded to\r\nmake another change. This time he sought a marsh; two hours' stay there\r\nwas sufficient to satisfy him, that that too was no place to tarry in,\r\neven for a single night. He, therefore, left immediately. A third time,\r\nhe returned to the hotel, where he remained only two days. His appeals\r\nhad at last reached the heart of his mother--she could no longer bear to\r\nsee him struggling, and suffering, and not render him aid, whatever the\r\nconsequences might be. If she at first feared to lend him a helping\r\nhand, she now resolutely worked with a view of saving money to succor\r\nhim. Here the prospect began to brighten.\r\n\r\nA passage was secured for him on a steamer bound for Philadelphia. One\r\nmore day, and night must elapse, ere he could be received on board. The\r\njoyful anticipations which now filled his breast left no room for fear;\r\nindeed, he could scarcely contain himself; he was drunk with joy. In\r\nthis state of mind he concluded that nothing would afford him more\r\npleasure before leaving, than to spend his last hours at the wash house,\r\n\"under the floor.\" To this place he went with no fear of hunters before\r\nhis eyes. Charles had scarcely been three hours in this place, however,\r\nbefore three officers came in search of him. Two of them talked with\r\nIsabella, asked her about her \"boarders,\" etc.; in the meanwhile, one of\r\nthem uninvited, made his way up stairs. It so happened, that Charles was\r\nin this very portion of the house. His case now seemed more hopeless\r\nthan ever. The officer up stairs was separated from him simply by a thin\r\ncurtain. Women's garments hung all around. Instead of fainting or\r\nsurrendering, in the twinkling of an eye, Charles' inventive intellect,\r\nled him to enrobe himself in female attire. Here, to use his own\r\nlanguage, a \"thousand thoughts\" rushed into his mind in a minute. The\r\nnext instant he was going down stairs in the presence of the officers,\r\nhis old calico dress, bonnet and rig, attracting no further attention\r\nthan simply to elicit the following simple questions: \"Whose gal are\r\nyou?\" \"Mr. Cockling's, sir.\" \"What is your name?\" \"Delie, sir.\" \"Go on\r\nthen!\" said one of the officers, and on Charles went to avail himself of\r\nthe passage on the steamer which his mother had procured for him for the\r\nsum of thirty dollars.\r\n\r\nIn due time, he succeeded in getting on the steamer, but he soon\r\nlearned, that her course was not direct to Philadelphia, but that some\r\nstay would be made in Norfolk, Va. Although disappointed, yet this being\r\na step in the right direction, he made up his mind to be patient. He was\r\ndelayed in Norfolk four weeks. From the time Charles first escaped, his\r\nowner (Davis the negro trader), had kept a standing reward of $550\r\nadvertised for his recovery. This showed that Davis was willing to risk\r\nheavy expenses for Charles as well as gave evidence that he believed him\r\nstill secreted either about Richmond, Petersburg, or Old Point Comfort.\r\nIn this belief he was not far from being correct, for Charles spent most\r\nof his time in either of these three places, from the day of his escape\r\nuntil the day that he finally embarked. At last, the long looked-for\r\nhour arrived to start for Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nHe was to leave his mother, with no hope of ever seeing her again, but\r\nshe had purchased herself and was called free. Her name was Margaret\r\nJohnson. Three brothers likewise were ever in his thoughts, (in chains),\r\n\"Henry,\" \"Bill,\" and \"Sam,\" (half brothers). But after all the hope of\r\nfreedom outweighed every other consideration, and he was prepared to\r\ngive up all for liberty. To die rather than remain a slave was his\r\nresolve.\r\n\r\nCharles arrived per steamer, from Norfolk, on the 11th day of November,\r\n1854. The Richmond papers bear witness to the fact, that Benjamin Davis\r\nadvertised Charles Gilbert, for mouths prior to this date, as has been\r\nstated in this narrative. As to the correctness of the story, all that\r\nthe writer has to say is, that he took it down from the lips of Charles,\r\nhurriedly, directly after his arrival, with no thought of magnifying a\r\nsingle incident. On the contrary, much that was of interest in the story\r\nhad to be omitted. Instead of being overdrawn, not half of the\r\nparticulars were recorded. Had the idea then been entertained, that the\r\nnarrative of this young slave-warrior was to be brought to light in the\r\nmanner and time that it now is, a far more thrilling account of his\r\nadventures might have been written. Other colored men who knew both\r\nDavis and Charles, as well as one man ordinarily knows another, rejoiced\r\nat seeing Charles in Philadelphia, and they listened with perfect faith\r\nto his story. So marvellous were the incidents of his escape, that his\r\nsufferings in Slavery, previous to his heroic struggles to throw off the\r\nyoke, were among the facts omitted from the records. While this may be\r\nregretted it is, nevertheless, gratifying on the whole to have so good\r\nan account of him as was preserved. It is needless to say, that the\r\nCommittee took especial pleasure in aiding him, and listening to so\r\nremarkable a story narrated so intelligently by one who had been a\r\nslave.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBERTY OR DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nJIM BOW-LEGS, _alias_ BILL PAUL.\r\n\r\nIn 1855 a traveler arrived with the above name, who, on examination, was\r\nfound to possess very extraordinary characteristics. As a hero and\r\nadventurer some passages of his history were most remarkable. His\r\nschooling had been such as could only be gathered on plantations under\r\nbrutal overseers;--or while fleeing,--or in swamps,--in prisons,--or on\r\nthe auction-block, etc.; in which condition he was often found.\r\nNevertheless in these circumstances his mind got well stored with\r\nvigorous thoughts--neither books nor friendly advisers being at his\r\ncommand. Yet his native intelligence as it regarded human nature, was\r\nextraordinary. His resolution and perseverance never faltered. In all\r\nrespects he was a remarkable man. He was a young man, weighing about one\r\nhundred and eighty pounds, of uncommon muscular strength. He was born in\r\nthe State of Georgia, Oglethorpe county, and was owned by Dr. Thomas\r\nStephens, of Lexington. On reaching the Vigilance Committee in\r\nPhiladelphia, his story was told many times over to one and another.\r\nHour after hour was occupied by friends in listening to the simple\r\nnarrative of his struggles for freedom. A very full account of \"Jim,\"\r\nwas forwarded in a letter to M.A. Shadd, the then Editress of the\r\n\"Provincial Freeman.\" Said account has been carefully preserved, and is\r\nhere annexed as it appeared in the columns of the above named paper:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I must now pass to a third adventurer. The one to whom I\r\n    allude, is a young man of twenty-six years of age, by the name\r\n    of 'Jim,' who fled from near Charleston, S.C. Taking all the\r\n    facts and circumstances into consideration respecting the\r\n    courageous career of this successful adventurer for freedom, his\r\n    case is by far more interesting than any I have yet referred to.\r\n    Indeed, for the good of the cause, and the honor of one who\r\n    gained his liberty by periling his life so frequently:--shot\r\n    several times,--making six unsuccessful attempts to escape from\r\n    the far South,--numberless times chased by\r\n    bloodhounds,--captured, imprisoned and sold repeatedly,--living\r\n    for months in the woods, swamps and caves, subsisting mainly on\r\n    parched corn and berries, &c., &c., his narrative ought, by all\r\n    means, to be published, though I doubt very much whether many\r\n    could be found who could persuade themselves to believe\r\n    one-tenth part of this marvellous story.\r\n\r\n    Though this poor Fugitive was utterly ignorant of letters, his\r\n    natural good sense and keen perception qualified him to arrest\r\n    the attention and interest the heart in a most remarkable\r\n    degree.\r\n\r\n    His master finding him not available, on account of his\r\n    absconding propensities, would gladly have offered him for sale.\r\n    He was once taken to Florida, for that purpose; but, generally,\r\n    traders being wide awake, on inspecting him, would almost\r\n    invariably pronounce him a 'd----n rascal,' because he would\r\n    never fail to eye them sternly, as they inspected him. The\r\n    obedient and submissive slave is always recognized by hanging\r\n    his head and looking on the ground, when looked at by a\r\n    slave-holder. This lesson Jim had never learned, hence he was\r\n    not to be trusted.\r\n\r\n    His head and chest, and indeed his entire structure, as solid as\r\n    a rock, indicated that he was physically no ordinary man; and\r\n    not being under the influence of the spirit of \"non-resistance,\"\r\n    he had occasionally been found to be a rather formidable\r\n    customer.\r\n\r\n    His father was a full-blooded Indian, brother to the noted\r\n    Indian Chief, Billy Bowlegs; his mother was quite black and of\r\n    unmixed blood.\r\n\r\n    For five or six years, the greater part of Jim's time was\r\n    occupied in trying to escape, and in being in prison for sale,\r\n    to punish him for running away.\r\n\r\n    His mechanical genius was excellent, so were his geographical\r\n    abilities. He could make shoes or do carpenter's work very\r\n    handily, though he had never had the chance to learn. As to\r\n    traveling by night or day, he was always road-ready and having\r\n    an uncommon memory, could give exceedingly good accounts of what\r\n    he saw, etc.\r\n\r\n    When he entered a swamp, and had occasion to take a nap he took\r\n    care first to decide upon the posture he must take, so that if\r\n    come upon unexpectedly by the hounds and slave-hunters, he might\r\n    know in an instant which way to steer to defeat them. He always\r\n    carried a liquid, which he had prepared, to prevent hounds from\r\n    scenting him, which he said had never failed. As soon as the\r\n    hounds came to the place where he had rubbed his legs and feet\r\n    with said liquid, they could follow him no further, but howled\r\n    and turned immediately.\r\n\r\n    Quite a large number of the friends of the slave saw this\r\n    noble-hearted fugitive, and would sit long and listen with the\r\n    most undivided attention to his narrative--none doubting for a\r\n    moment, I think, the entire truthfulness of his story. Strange\r\n    as his story was, there was so much natural simplicity in his\r\n    manner and countenance, one could not refrain from believing\r\n    him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSALT-WATER FUGITIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was an exceptional case, as this passenger did not reach the\r\nVigilance Committee of Philadelphia, yet to exclude him on this account,\r\nwould be doing an injustice to history.\r\n\r\nThe facts in his case were incontestably established in the Philadelphia\r\nRegister in April, 1854, from which the following thrilling account is\r\ntaken:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The steamship, Keystone State, which arrived at this port on\r\n    Saturday morning, had just entered Delaware Bay, when a man was\r\n    discovered secreted outside of the vessel and under the guards.\r\n    When brought from his hiding-place, he was found to be a\r\n    Fugitive Slave, who had secreted himself there before the vessel\r\n    left Savannah on Wednesday, and had remained in that place from\r\n    the time of starting!\r\n\r\n    His position was such, that the water swept over and around him\r\n    almost constantly. He had some bread in his pocket, which he had\r\n    intended for subsistence until he could reach a land of liberty.\r\n    It was saturated with sea-water and dissolved to a pulp.\r\n\r\n    When our readers remember the high winds of Friday, and the\r\n    sudden change to cold during that night, and the fact that the\r\n    fugitive had remained in that situation for three days and\r\n    nights, we think it will be conceded that he fully earned his\r\n    liberty, and that the \"institution,\" which was so intolerable\r\n    that he was willing to run the risk of almost certain death to\r\n    escape from it had no very great attractions for him. But the\r\n    poor man was doomed to disappointment. The captain ordered the\r\n    vessel to put into Newcastle, where, the fugitive, hardly able\r\n    to stand, was taken on shore and incarcerated, and where he now\r\n    awaits the order of his owner in Savannah. The following\r\n    additional particulars are from the same paper of the 21st.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Keystone State case.--Our article yesterday morning brought\r\n    us several letters of inquiry and offers of contributions to aid\r\n    in the purchase from his master of the unfortunate inmate of\r\n    Newcastle jail. In answer to the former, we would say, that the\r\n    steamer Keystone State, left Savannah, at 9 A.M., last\r\n    Wednesday. It was about the same hour next morning that the men\r\n    engaged in heaving lead, heard a voice from under the guards\r\n    imploring help. A rope was procured, and the man relieved from\r\n    his dangerous and suffering situation. He was well cared for\r\n    immediately; a suit of dry clothes was furnished him, and he was\r\n    given his share of the contents of the boat pantry. On arriving\r\n    at Newcastle, the captain had him placed in jail, for the\r\n    purpose, as we are informed, of taking him back to Savannah.\r\n\r\n    To those who have offered contributions so liberally, we answer,\r\n    that the prospect is, that only a small amount will be\r\n    needed--enough to fee a lawyer to sue out a writ of habeas\r\n    corpus. The salt water fugitive claims to be a free man, and a\r\n    native of Philadelphia. He gives his name as Edward Davis, and\r\n    says that he formerly lived at No. 5 Steel's court, that he was\r\n    a pupil in Bird's school, on Sixth St. above Lombard, and that\r\n    he has a sister living at Mr. Diamond's, a distiller, on South\r\n    St. We are not informed why he was in Georgia, from which he\r\n    took such an extraordinary means to effect his escape. If the\r\n    above assertion be true, we apprehend little trouble in\r\n    restoring the man to his former home. The claim of the captain\r\n    to take him back to Savannah, will not be listened to for a\r\n    moment by any court. The only claim the owners of the \"Keystone\r\n    State\" or the captain can have on salt water Davis, is for half\r\n    passenger fare; he came half the way as a fish. A gentleman who\r\n    came from Wilmington yesterday, assures us that the case is in\r\n    good hands at Newcastle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFULL PARTICULARS OF THE ABDUCTION, ENSLAVING AND ESCAPE OF DAVIS.\r\nATTEMPT TO SEDUCE HIM TO SLAVERY AGAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    The case of the colored man Davis, who made such a bold stroke\r\n    to regain his liberty, by periling his life on board the steamer\r\n    Keystone State, has excited very general attention. He has given\r\n    a detailed account of his abduction and sale as a slave in the\r\n    State of Maryland and Georgia, and some of his adventures up to\r\n    the time of reaching Delaware. His own story is substantially as\r\n    follows:\r\n\r\n    He left Philadelphia on the 15th of September, 1851, and went to\r\n    Harrisburg, intending to go to Hollidaysburg; took a canal boat\r\n    for Havre de Grace, where he arrived next day. There he hired on\r\n    board the schooner Thomas and Edward (oyster boat), of\r\n    Baltimore. Went from Havre de Grace to St. Michael's, for\r\n    oysters, thence to Baltimore, and thence to Havre de Grace\r\n    again.\r\n\r\n    He then hired to a Mr. Sullivan, who kept a grocery store, to do\r\n    jobs. While there, a constable, named Smith, took him before a\r\n    magistrate named Graham, who fined him fifteen or twenty dollars\r\n    for violating the law in relation to free negroes coming into\r\n    the State. This fine he was not able to pay, and Smith took him\r\n    to Bell Air prison. Sheriff Gaw wrote to Mr. Maitland in\r\n    Philadelphia, to whom he referred, and received an answer that\r\n    Mr. Maitland was dead and none of the family knew him. He\r\n    remained in that prison nearly two months. He then had a trial\r\n    in court before a Judge Grier (most unfortunate name), who\r\n    sentenced him to be sold to pay his fine and expenses, amounting\r\n    to fifty dollars.\r\n\r\n    After a few days and _without being offered at public sale_, he\r\n    was taken out of jail at two o'clock in the morning and carried\r\n    to Campbell's slave pen, in Baltimore, where he remained several\r\n    months. While there, he was employed to cook for some fifty or\r\n    sixty slaves, being told that he was working out his fine and\r\n    jail fees. After being there about six months, he was taken out\r\n    of prison, handcuffed by one Winters, who took him and two or\r\n    three others to Washington and thence to Charleston, S.C. Here\r\n    Winters left them, and they were taken by steamboat to Savannah.\r\n    While on board the boat, he learned that himself and the other\r\n    two had been sold to Mr. William Dean, of Macon, where he stayed\r\n    two days, and was taken from that place to the East Valley\r\n    Railroad.\r\n\r\n    Subsequently he was sent to work on the Possum Tail Railroad.\r\n    Here he was worked so hard, that in one month he lost his\r\n    health. The other two men taken on with him, failed before he\r\n    did. He was then sent to Macon, and thence to the cotton\r\n    plantation again.\r\n\r\n    During the time he worked on the railroad he had allowed him for\r\n    food, one peck of corn meal, four pounds of bacon, and one quart\r\n    of molasses per week. He cooked it himself at night, for the\r\n    next day's use. He worked at packing cotton for four or five\r\n    months, and in the middle of November, 1852, was sent back to\r\n    the railroad, where he was again set to wheeling.\r\n\r\n    He worked at \"task work\" two months, being obliged to wheel\r\n    _sixteen_ square yards per day. At the end of two months he\r\n    broke down again, and was sick. They tried one month to cure\r\n    him, but did not succeed. In July, 1853, he was taken to an\r\n    infirmary in Macon. Dr. Nottinghan and Dr. Harris, of that\r\n    institution, both stated that his was the worst case of the kind\r\n    they ever had. He remained at the infirmary two months and\r\n    partially recovered. He told the story of his wrongs to these\r\n    physicians, who tried to buy him. One of his legs was drawn up\r\n    so that he could not walk well, and they offered four hundred\r\n    dollars for him, which his master refused. The doctors wanted\r\n    him to attend their patients, (mostly slaves). While in Georgia\r\n    he was frequently asked where he came from, being found more\r\n    intelligent than the common run of slaves.\r\n\r\n    On the 12th of March he ran away from Macon and went to\r\n    Savannah. There he hid in a stable until Tuesday afternoon at\r\n    six o'clock, when he secreted himself on board the Keystone\r\n    State. At 9 o'clock the next morning the Keystone State left\r\n    with Davis secreted, as we have before stated. With his\r\n    imprisonment in Newcastle, after being pronounced free, our\r\n    readers are already familiar. We subjoin the documents on which\r\n    he was discharged from his imprisonment in Newcastle, and his\r\n    subsequent re-committal on the oath of Capt. Hardie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPY OF FIRST ORDER OF COMMITMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    New Castle county, ss., State of Delaware.--To Wm. R.

Lynam, forthwith to convey and deliver into the custody of\r\n    the said Sheriff, or keeper of the said jail, the body of the\r\n    said Davis, and you the said Sheriff or receiver of the body of\r\n    the said Davis into your custody in the said jail, and him there\r\n    safely keep until he be thence delivered by due course of the\r\n    law.\r\n\r\n    Given under my hand and seal at New Castle this 21st day of\r\n    March, A.D., 1854.\r\n\r\n    JOHN BRADFORD, J.P.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the fourth of April, the Marshal of Macon called at the jail in\r\nNewcastle, and demanded him as a fugitive slave, but the Sheriff refused\r\nto give him up until a fair hearing could be had according to the laws\r\nof the State of Delaware. The Marshal has returned to Georgia, and will\r\nprobably bring the claimant on the next trip of the Keystone State. The\r\nauthorities of Delaware manifest no disposition to deliver up a man\r\nwhose freedom has been so clearly proved; but every effort will be made\r\nto reduce him again to slavery by the man who claims him, in which, it\r\nseems, he has the hearty co-operation of Capt. Hardie. A trial will be\r\nhad before U.S. Commissioner Guthrie, and we have every reason to\r\nsuppose it will be a fair one. The friends of right and justice should\r\nremember that such a trial will be attended with considerable expense,\r\nand that the imprisoned man has been too long deprived of his liberty to\r\nhave money to pay for his own defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL GREEN ALIAS WESLEY KINNARD, AUGUST 28th, 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEN YEARS IN THE PENITENTIARY FOR HAVING A COPY OF UNCLE TOM'S CABIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe passenger answering to the above name, left Indian Creek, Chester\r\nCo., Md., where he had been held to service or labor, by Dr. James Muse.\r\nOne week had elapsed from the time he set out until his arrival in\r\nPhiladelphia. Although he had never enjoyed school privileges of any\r\nkind, yet he was not devoid of intelligence. He had profited by his\r\ndaily experience as a slave, and withal, had managed to learn to read\r\nand write a little, despite law and usage to the contrary. Sam was about\r\ntwenty-five years of age and by trade, a blacksmith. Before running\r\naway, his general character for sobriety, industry, and religion, had\r\nevidently been considered good, but in coveting his freedom and running\r\naway to obtain it, he had sunk far below the utmost limit of forgiveness\r\nor mercy in the estimation of the slave-holders of Indian Creek.\r\n\r\nDuring his intercourse with the Vigilance Committee, while rejoicing\r\nover his triumphant flight, he gave, with no appearance of excitement,\r\nbut calmly, and in a common-sense like manner, a brief description of\r\nhis master, which was entered on the record book substantially as\r\nfollows: \"Dr. James Muse is thought by the servants to be the worst man\r\nin Maryland, inflicting whipping and all manner of cruelties upon the\r\nservants.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Sam gave reasons for this sweeping charge, which left no room for\r\ndoubt, on the part of the Committee, of his sincerity and good judgment,\r\nit was not deemed necessary to make a note of more of the doctor's\r\ncharacter than seemed actually needed, in order to show why \"Sam\" had\r\ntaken passage on the Underground Rail Road. For several years, \"Sam\" was\r\nhired out by the doctor at blacksmithing; in this situation, daily\r\nwearing the yoke of unrequited labor, through the kindness of Harriet\r\nTubman (sometimes called \"Moses\"), the light of the Underground Rail\r\nRoad and Canada suddenly illuminated his mind. It was new to him, but he\r\nwas quite too intelligent and liberty-loving, not to heed the valuable\r\ninformation which this sister of humanity imparted. Thenceforth he was\r\nin love with Canada, and likewise a decided admirer of the U.R. Road.\r\nHarriet was herself, a shrewd and fearless agent, and well understood\r\nthe entire route from that part of the country to Canada. The spring\r\nprevious, she had paid a visit to the very neighborhood in which \"Sam\"\r\nlived, expressly to lead her own brothers out of \"Egypt.\" She succeeded.\r\nTo \"Sam\" this was cheering and glorious news, and he made up his mind,\r\nthat before a great while, Indian Creek should have one less slave and\r\nthat Canada should have one more citizen. Faithfully did he watch an\r\nopportunity to carry out his resolution. In due time a good Providence\r\nopened the way, and to \"Sam's\" satisfaction he reached Philadelphia,\r\nhaving encountered no peculiar difficulties. The Committee, perceiving\r\nthat he was smart, active, and promising, encouraged his undertaking,\r\nand having given him friendly advice, aided him in the usual manner.\r\nLetters of introduction were given him, and he was duly forwarded on his\r\nway. He had left his father, mother, and one sister behind. Samuel and\r\nCatharine were the names of his parents. Thus far, his escape would seem\r\nnot to affect his parents, nor was it apparent that there was any other\r\ncause why the owner should revenge himself upon them.\r\n\r\nThe father was an old local preacher in the Methodist Church--much\r\nesteemed as an inoffensive, industrious man; earning his bread by the\r\nsweat of his brow, and contriving to move along in the narrow road\r\nallotted colored people bond or free, without exciting a spirit of ill\r\nwill in the pro-slavery power of his community. But the rancor awakened\r\nin the breast of slave-holders in consequence of the high-handed step\r\nthe son had taken, brought the father under suspicion and hate. Under\r\nthe circumstances, the eye of Slavery could do nothing more than watch\r\nfor an occasion to pounce upon him. It was not long before the desired\r\nopportunity presented itself. Moved by parental affection, the old man\r\nconcluded to pay a visit to his boy, to see how he was faring in a\r\ndistant land, and among strangers. This resolution he quietly carried\r\ninto effect. He found his son in Canada, doing well; industrious; a man\r\nof sobriety, and following his father's footsteps religiously. That the\r\nold man's heart was delighted with what his eyes saw and his ears heard\r\nin Canada, none can doubt. But in the simplicity of his imagination, he\r\nnever dreamed that this visit was to be made the means of his\r\ndestruction. During the best portion of his days he had faithfully worn\r\nthe badge of Slavery, had afterwards purchased his freedom, and thus\r\nbecome a free man. He innocently conceived the idea that he was doing no\r\nharm in availing himself not only of his God-given rights, but of the\r\nrights that he had also purchased by the hard toil of his own hands. But\r\nthe enemy was lurking in ambush for him--thirsting for his blood. To his\r\nutter consternation, not long after his return from his visit to his son\r\n\"a party of gentlemen from the New Market district, went at night to\r\nGreen's house and made search, whereupon was found a copy of Uncle Tom's\r\nCabin, etc.\" This was enough--the hour had come, wherein to wreak\r\nvengeance upon poor Green. The course pursued and the result, may be\r\nseen in the following statement taken from the Cambridge (Md.),\r\n\"Democrat,\" of April 29th, 1857, and communicated by the writer to the\r\n\"Provincial Freeman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    SAM GREEN.\r\n\r\n    The case of the State against Sam Green (free negro) indicted\r\n    for having in his possession, papers, pamphlets and pictorial\r\n    representations, having a tendency to create discontent, etc.,\r\n    among the people of color in the State, was tried before the\r\n    court on Friday last.\r\n\r\n    This case was of the utmost importance, and has created in the\r\n    public mind a great deal of interest--it being the first case of\r\n    the kind ever having occurred in our country.\r\n\r\n    It appeared, in evidence, that this Green has a son in Canada,\r\n    to whom Green made a visit last summer. Since his return to this\r\n    county, suspicion has fastened upon him, as giving aid and\r\n    assisting slaves who have since absconded and reached Canada,\r\n    and several weeks ago, a party of gentlemen from New Market\r\n    district, went at night, to Green's house and made search,\r\n    whereupon was found a volume of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" a map of\r\n    Canada, several schedules of routes to the North, and a letter\r\n    from his son in Canada, detailing the pleasant trip he had, the\r\n    number of friends he met with on the way, with plenty to eat,\r\n    drink, etc., and concludes with a request to his father, that he\r\n    shall tell certain other slaves, naming them, to come on, which\r\n    slaves, it is well known, did leave shortly afterwards, and have\r\n    reached Canada. The case was argued with great ability, the\r\n    counsel on both sides displaying a great deal of ingenuity,\r\n    learning and eloquence. The first indictment was for the having\r\n    in possession the letter, map and route schedules.\r\n\r\n    Notwithstanding the mass of evidence given, to show the\r\n    prisoner's guilt, in unlawfully having in his possession these\r\n    documents, and the nine-tenths of the community in which he\r\n    lived, believed that he had a hand in the running away of\r\n    slaves, it was the opinion of the court, that the law under\r\n    which he was indicted, was not applicable to the case, and that\r\n    he must, accordingly, render a verdict of not guilty.\r\n\r\n    He was immediately arraigned upon another indictment, for having\r\n    in possession \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" and tried; in this case the\r\n    court has not yet rendered a verdict, but holds it under _curia_\r\n    till after the Somerset county court. It is to be hoped, the\r\n    court will find the evidence in this case sufficient to bring it\r\n    within the scope of the law under which the prisoner is indicted\r\n    (that of 1842, chap. 272), and that the prisoner may meet his\r\n    due reward--be that what it may.\r\n\r\n    That there is something required to be done by our Legislators,\r\n    for the protection of slave property, is evident from the\r\n    variety of constructions put upon the statute in this case, and\r\n    we trust, that at the next meeting of the Legislature there will\r\n    be such amendments, as to make the law on this subject,\r\n    perfectly clear and comprehensible to the understanding of every\r\n    one.\r\n\r\n    In the language of the assistant counsel for the State, \"Slavery\r\n    must be protected or it must be abolished.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the same sheet, of May 20th, the terrible doom of Samuel Green, is\r\nannounced in the following words:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the case of the State against Sam Green, (free negro) who was\r\n    tried at the April term of the Circuit Court of this county, for\r\n    having in his possession abolition pamphlets, among which was\r\n    \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" has been found guilty by the court, and\r\n    sentenced to the penitentiary for the term of ten years--until\r\n    the 14th of May, 1867.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe son, a refugee in Canada, hearing the distressing news of his\r\nfather's sad fate in the hands of the relentless \"gentlemen,\" often\r\nwrote to know if there was any prospect of his deliverance. The\r\nsubjoined letter is a fair sample of his correspondence:\r\n\r\n\r\n    SALFORD, 22,1857.\r\n\r\n    Dear Sir I take my pen in hand to Request a faver of you if you\r\n    can by any means without duin InJestus to your self or your\r\n    Bisness to grant it as I Bleve you to be a man that would\r\n    Sympathize in such a ones Condition as my self I Reseved a\r\n    letter that Stats to me that my Fater has ben Betraed in the act\r\n    of helping sum frend to Canada and the law has Convicted and\r\n    Sentanced him to the Stats prison for 10 yeares his White Frands\r\n    ofered 2 thousen Dollers to Redem him but they would not short\r\n    three thousen. I am in Canada and it is a Dificult thing to get\r\n    a letter to any of my Frands in Maryland so as to get prop per\r\n    infermation abot it--if you can by any means get any in\r\n    telligence from Baltimore City a bot this Event Plese do so and\r\n    Rit word and all so all the inform mation that you think prop\r\n    per as Regards the Evant and the best mathod to Redeme him and\r\n    so Plese Rite soon as you can You will oblige your sir Frand and\r\n    Drect your letter to Salford P. office C.W.\r\n\r\n    SAMUEL GREEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this dark hour the friends of the Slave could do but little more than\r\nsympathize with this heart-stricken son and grey-headed father. The aged\r\nfollower of the Rejected and Crucified had like Him to bear the\r\n\"reproach of many,\" and make his bed with the wicked in the\r\nPenitentiary. Doubtless there were a few friends in his neighborhood who\r\nsympathized with him, but they were powerless to aid the old man. But\r\nthanks to a kind Providence, the great deliverance brought about during\r\nthe Rebellion by which so many captives were freed, also unlocked Samuel\r\nGreen's prison-doors and he was allowed to go free.\r\n\r\nAfter his liberation from the Penitentiary, we had from his own lips\r\nnarrations of his years of suffering--of the bitter cup, that he was\r\ncompelled to drink, and of his being sustained by the Almighty Arm--but\r\nno notes were taken at the time, consequently we have nothing more to\r\nadd concerning him, save quite a faithful likeness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN IRISH GIRL'S DEVOTION TO FREEDOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN LOVE WITH A SLAVE--GETS HIM OFF TO CANADA--FOLLOWS HIM--MARRIAGE, &C.\r\nHaving dwelt on the sad narratives of Samuel Green and his son in the\r\npreceding chapter, it is quite a relief to be able to introduce a\r\ntraveler whose story contains incidents less painful to contemplate.\r\nFrom the record book the following brief account is taken:\r\n\r\n\"April 27, 1855. John Hall arrived safely from Richmond, Va., per\r\nschooner, (Captain B). One hundred dollars were paid for his passage.\"\r\nIn Richmond he was owned by James Dunlap, a merchant. John had been sold\r\nseveral times, in consequence of which, he had possessed very good\r\nopportunities of experiencing the effect of change of owners. Then, too,\r\nthe personal examination made before sale, and the gratification\r\nafforded his master when he (John), brought a good price--left no very\r\npleasing impressions on his mind.\r\n\r\nBy one of his owners, named Burke, John alleged that he had been\r\n\"cruelly used.\" When quite young, both he and his sister, together with\r\ntheir mother, were sold by Burke. From that time he had seen neither\r\nmother nor sister--they were sold separately. For three or four years\r\nthe desire to seek liberty had been fondly cherished, and nothing but\r\nthe want of a favorable opportunity had deterred him from carrying out\r\nhis designs.  He considered himself much \"imposed upon\" by his master,\r\nparticularly as he was allowed \"no choice about living\" as he \"desired.\"\r\nThis was indeed ill-treatment as John viewed the matter. John may have\r\nwanted too much. He was about thirty-five years of age, light\r\ncomplexion--tall--rather handsome-looking, intelligent, and of good\r\nmanners. But notwithstanding these prepossessing features, John's owner\r\nvalued him at only $1,000. If he had been a few shades darker and only\r\nabout half as intelligent as he was, he would have been worth at least\r\n$500 more. The idea of having had a white father, in many instances,\r\ndepreciated the pecuniary value of male slaves, if not of the other sex.\r\nJohn emphatically was one of this injured class; he evidently had blood\r\nin his veins which decidedly warred against submitting to the yoke. In\r\naddition to the influence which such rebellious blood exerted over him,\r\ntogether with a considerable amount of intelligence, he was also under\r\nthe influence and advice of a daughter of old Ireland. She was heart and\r\nsoul with John in all his plans which looked Canada-ward. This it was\r\nthat \"sent him away.\"\r\n\r\nIt is very certain, that this Irish girl was not annoyed by the kinks in\r\nJohn's hair. Nor was she overly fastidious about the small percentage of\r\ncolored blood visible in John's complexion. It was, however, a strange\r\noccurrence and very hard to understand. Not a stone was left unturned\r\nuntil John was safely on the Underground Rail Road. Doubtless she helped\r\nto earn the money which was paid for his passage. And when he was safe\r\noff, it is not too much to say, that John was not a whit more delighted\r\nthan was his intended Irish lassie, Mary Weaver. John had no sooner\r\nreached Canada than Mary's heart was there too. Circumstances, however,\r\nrequired that she should remain in Richmond a number of months for the\r\npurpose of winding up some of her affairs. As soon as the way opened for\r\nher, she followed him. It was quite manifest, that she had not let a\r\nsingle opportunity slide, but seized the first chance and arrived partly\r\nby means of the Underground Rail Road and partly by the regular train.\r\nMany difficulties were surmounted before and after leaving Richmond, by\r\nwhich they earned their merited success. From Canada, where they\r\nanticipated entering upon the matrimonial career with mutual\r\nsatisfaction, it seemed to afford them great pleasure to write back\r\nfrequently, expressing their heartfelt gratitude for assistance, and\r\ntheir happiness in the prospect of being united under the favorable\r\nauspices of freedom! At least two or three of these letters, bearing on\r\nparticular phases of their escape, etc., are too valuable not to be\r\npublished in this connection:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    HAMILTON, March 25th, 1856.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Still:--Sir and Friend--I take the liberty of addressing you\r\n    with these few lines hoping that you will attend to what I shall\r\n    request of you.\r\n\r\n    I have written to Virginia and have not received an answer yet.\r\n    I want to know if you can get any one of your city to go to\r\n    Richmond for me. If you can, I will pay the expense of the\r\n    whole. The person that I want the messenger to see is a white\r\n    girl. I expect you know who I allude to, it is the girl that\r\n    sent me away. If you can get any one to go, you will please\r\n    write right away and tell me the cost, &c. I will forward the\r\n    money and a letter. Please use your endeavors.\r\n\r\n    Yours Respectfuliy,\r\n\r\n    JOHN HALL.\r\n\r\n    Direct yours to Mr. Hill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    HAMILTON, Sept. 15th, 1856.\r\n\r\n    To Mr. Still, Dear Sir:--I take this opportunity of addressing\r\n    these few lines to you hoping to find you in good health I am\r\n    happy to inform you that Miss Weaver arrived here on Tuesday\r\n    last, and I can assure you it was indeed a happy day. As for\r\n    your part that you done I will not attempt to tell you how\r\n    thankful I am, but I hope that you can imagine what my feelings\r\n    are to you. I cannot find words sufficient to express my\r\n    gratitude to you, I think the wedding will take place on Tuesday\r\n    next, I have seen some of the bread from your house, and she\r\n    says it is the best bread she has had since she has been in\r\n    America. Sometimes she has impudence enough to tell me she would\r\n    rather be where you are in Philadelphia than to be here with me.\r\n    I hope this will be no admiration to you for no honest hearted\r\n    person ever saw you that would not desire to be where you are,\r\n    No flattery, but candidly speaking, you are worthy all the\r\n    praise of any person who has ever been with you, I am now like a\r\n    deserted Christian, but yet I have asked so much, and all has\r\n    been done yet I must ask again, My love to Mrs. Still. Dear Mr.\r\n    Still I now ask you please to exercise all your influence to get\r\n    this young man Willis Johnson from Richmond for me It is the\r\n    young man that Miss Weaver told you about, he is in Richmond I\r\n    think he is at the corner of Fushien Street, & Grace in a house\r\n    of one Mr. Rutherford, there is several Rutherford in the\r\n    neighborhood, there is a church call'd the third Baptist Church,\r\n    on the R.H. side going up Grace street, directly opposite the\r\n    Baptist church at the corner, is Mrs. Meads Old School at one\r\n    corner, and Mr. Rutherfords is at the other corner. He can be\r\n    found out by seeing Fountain Tombs who belongs to Mr. Rutherford\r\n    and if you should not see him, there is James Turner who lives\r\n    at the Governors, Please to see Captain Bayliss and tell him to\r\n    take these directions and go to John Hill, in Petersburgh, and\r\n    he may find him. Tell Captain Bayliss that if he ever did me a\r\n    friendly thing in his life which he did do one friendly act, if\r\n    he will take this on himself, and if money should be lacking I\r\n    will forward any money that he may require, I hope you will\r\n    sympathize with the poor young fellow, and tell the captain to\r\n    do all in his power to get him and the costs shall be paid. He\r\n    lies now between death or victory, for I know the man he belongs\r\n    to would just as soon kill him as not, if he catches him, I here\r\n    enclose to you a letter for Mr. Wm. C. Mayo, and please to send\r\n    it as directed. In this letter I have asked him to send a box to\r\n    you for me, which you will please pay the fare of the express\r\n    upon it, when you get it please to let me know, and I will send\r\n    you the money to pay the expenses of the carriage clear through.\r\n    Please to let Mr. Mayo know how to direct a box to you, and the\r\n    best way to send it from Richmond to Philadelphia. You will\r\n    greatly oblige me by so doing. In this letter I have enclosed a\r\n    trifle for postage which you will please to keep on account of\r\n    my letters I hope you wont think hard of me but I simply send it\r\n    because I know you have done enough, and are now doing more,\r\n    without imposing in the matter I have done it a great many more\r\n    of our people who you have done so much fore. No more from your\r\n    humble and oldest servant.\r\n\r\n    JOHN HALL, Norton's Hotel, Hamilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    MONDAY, Sept. 29, 56.\r\n\r\n    Sir:--I take this opportunity of informing you that we are in\r\n    excellent health, and hope you are the same, I wrote a letter to\r\n    you about 2 weeks ago and have not yet had an answer to it I\r\n    wish to inform you that the wedding took place on Tuesday last,\r\n    and Mrs. Hall now sends her best love to you, I enclose a letter\r\n    which I wish you to forward to Mr. Mayo, you will see in his\r\n    letter what I have said to him and I wish you would furnish him\r\n    with such directions as it requires for him to send them things\r\n    to you.

I have been expecting a\r\n    letter from you for some time but I suppose your business has\r\n    prevented you from writing. I suppose you have not heard from\r\n    any of my friends at Richmond. I have been longing to hear some\r\n    news from that part, you may think \"Out of sight and out of\r\n    mind,\" but I can assure you, no matter how far I may be, or in\r\n    what distant land, I shall never forget you, if I can never\r\n    reach you by letters you may be sure I shall always think of\r\n    you. I have found a great many friends in my life, but I must\r\n    say you are the best one I ever met with, except one, you must\r\n    know who that is, 'tis one who if I did not consider a friend, I\r\n    could not consider any other person a friend, and that is Mrs.\r\n    Hall. Please to let me know if the navigation between New York &\r\n    Richmond is closed. Please to let me know whether it would be\r\n    convenient to you to go to New York if it is please let me know\r\n    what is the expense. Tell Mrs Still that my wife would be very\r\n    happy to receive a letter from her at some moment when she is at\r\n    leisure, for I know from what little I have seen of domestic\r\n    affairs it keeps her pretty well employed, And I know she has\r\n    not much time to write but if it were but two lines, she would\r\n    be happy to receive it from her, my reason for wanting you to go\r\n    to New York, there is a young man named Richard Myers and I\r\n    should like for you to see him. He goes on board the Orono to\r\n    Richmond and is a particular friend of mine and by seeing him I\r\n    could get my clothes from Richmond, I expect to be out of employ\r\n    in a few days, as the hotel is about to close on the 1st January\r\n    and I hope you will write to me soon I want you to send me word\r\n    how you and all the family are and all the news you can, you\r\n    must excuse my short letter, as it is now near one o'clock and I\r\n    must attend to business, but I have not written half what I\r\n    intended to, as time is short, hoping to hear from you soon I\r\n    remain yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n    JOHN HALL.\r\n\r\n    Mr. and Mrs. Hill desire their best respects to you and Mrs.\r\n    Still.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that this is a most extraordinary occurrence. In\r\nsome respects it is without a parallel. It was, however, no uncommon\r\nthing for white men (slave-holders) in the South to have colored wives\r\nand children whom, they did not hesitate to live with and acknowledge by\r\ntheir actions, with their means, and in their wills as the rightful\r\nheirs of their substance. Probably there is not a state in the Union\r\nwhere such relations have not existed. Seeing such usages, Mary might\r\nhave reasoned that she had as good a right to marry the one she loved\r\nmost as anybody else, particularly as she was in a \"free country.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"SAM\" NIXON ALIAS DR. THOMAS BAYNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ESCAPE OF A DENTIST ON THE U.G.R.R.--HE IS TAKEN FOR AN\r\nIMPOSTOR--ELECTED A MEMBER OF CITY COUNCIL IN NEW BEDFORD--STUDYING\r\nMEDICINE, ETC. But few could be found among the Underground Rail Road\r\npassengers who had a stronger repugnance to the unrequited labor system,\r\nor the recognized terms of \"master and slave,\" than Dr. Thomas Bayne.\r\nNor were many to be found who were more fearless and independent in\r\nuttering their sentiments. His place of bondage was in the city of\r\nNorfolk, Va., where he was held to service by Dr. C.F. Martin, a dentist\r\nof some celebrity. While with Dr. Martin, \"Sam\" learned dentistry in all\r\nits branches, and was often required by his master, the doctor, to\r\nfulfil professional engagements, both at home and at a distance, when it\r\ndid not suit his pleasure or convenience to appear in person. In the\r\nmechanical department, especially, \"Sam\" was called upon to execute the\r\nmost difficult tasks. This was not the testimony of \"Sam\" alone; various\r\nindividuals who were with him in Norfolk, but had moved to Philadelphia,\r\nand were living there at the time of his arrival, being invited to see\r\nthis distinguished professional piece of property, gave evidence which\r\nfully corroborated his. The master's professional practice, according to\r\n\"Sam's\" calculation, was worth $3,000 per annum. Full $1,000 of this\r\namount in the opinion of \"Sam\" was the result of his own fettered hands.\r\nNot only was \"Sam\" serviceable to the doctor in the mechanical and\r\npractical branches of his profession, but as a sort of ready reckoner\r\nand an apt penman, he was obviously considered by the doctor, a valuable\r\n\"article.\" He would frequently have \"Sam\" at his books instead of a\r\nbook-keeper. Of course, \"Sam\" had never received, from Dr. M., an hour's\r\nschooling in his life, but having perceptive faculties naturally very\r\nlarge, combined with much self-esteem, he could hardly help learning\r\nreadily. Had his master's design to keep him in ignorance been ever so\r\ngreat, he would have found it a labor beyond his power. But there is no\r\nreason to suppose that Dr. Martin was opposed to Sam's learning to read\r\nand write. We are pleased to note that no charges of ill-treatment are\r\nfound recorded against Dr. M. in the narrative of \"Sam.\"\r\n\r\nTrue, it appears that he had been sold several times in his younger\r\ndays, and had consequently been made to feel keenly, the smarts of\r\nSlavery, but nothing of this kind was charged against Dr. M., so that he\r\nmay be set down as a pretty fair man, for aught that is known to the\r\ncontrary, with the exception of depriving \"Sam\" of the just reward of\r\nhis labor, which, according to St. James, is pronounced a \"fraud.\" The\r\ndoctor did not keep \"Sam\" so closely confined to dentistry and\r\nbook-keeping that he had no time to attend occasionally to outside\r\nduties. It appears that he was quite active and successful as an\r\nUnderground Rail Road agent, and rendered important aid in various\r\ndirections. Indeed, Sam had good reason to suspect that the\r\nslave-holders were watching him, and that if he remained, he would most\r\nlikely find himself in \"hot water up to his eyes.\" Wisdom dictated that\r\nhe should \"pull up stakes\" and depart while the way was open. He knew\r\nthe captains who were then in the habit of taking similar passengers,\r\nbut he had some fears that they might not be able to pursue the business\r\nmuch longer. In contemplating the change which he was about to make,\r\n\"Sam\" felt it necessary to keep his movements strictly private. Not even\r\nwas he at liberty to break his mind to his wife and child, fearing that\r\nit would do them no good, and might prove his utter failure. His wife's\r\nname was Edna and his daughter was called Elizabeth; both were slaves\r\nand owned by E.P. Tabb, Esq., a hardware merchant of Norfolk.\r\n\r\nNo mention is made on the books, of ill-treatment, in connection with\r\nhis wife's servitude; it may therefore be inferred, that her situation\r\nwas not remarkably hard. It must not be supposed that \"Sam\" was not\r\ntruly attached to his wife. He gave abundant proof of true matrimonial\r\ndevotion, notwithstanding the secrecy of his arrangements for flight.\r\nBeing naturally hopeful, he concluded that he could better succeed in\r\nsecuring his wife after obtaining freedom himself, than in undertaking\r\nthe task beforehand.\r\n\r\nThe captain had two or three other Underground Rail Road male passengers\r\nto bring with him, besides \"Sam,\" for whom, arrangements had been\r\npreviously made--no more could be brought that trip. At the appointed\r\ntime, the passengers were at the disposal of the captain of the schooner\r\nwhich was to bring them out of Slavery into freedom. Fully aware of the\r\ndangerous consequences should he be detected, the captain, faithful to\r\nhis promise, secreted them in the usual manner, and set sail northward.\r\nInstead of landing his passengers in Philadelphia, as was his intention,\r\nfor some reason or other (the schooner may have been disabled), he\r\nlanded them on the New Jersey coast, not a great distance from Cape\r\nIsland. He directed them how to reach Philadelphia. Sam knew of friends\r\nin the city, and straightway used his ready pen to make known the\r\ndistress of himself and partners in tribulation. In making their way in\r\nthe direction of their destined haven, they reached Salem, New Jersey,\r\nwhere they were discovered to be strangers and fugitives, and were\r\ndirected to Abigail Goodwin, a Quaker lady, an abolitionist, long noted\r\nfor her devotion to the cause of freedom, and one of the most liberal\r\nand faithful friends of the Vigilance Committee of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThis friend's opportunities of witnessing fresh arrivals had been rare,\r\nand perhaps she had never before come in contact with a \"chattel\" so\r\nsmart as \"Sam.\" Consequently she was much embarrassed when she heard his\r\nstory, especially when he talked of his experience as a \"Dentist.\" She\r\nwas inclined to suspect that he was a \"shrewd impostor\" that needed\r\n\"watching\" instead of aiding. But her humanity forbade a hasty decision\r\non this point. She was soon persuaded to render him some assistance,\r\nnotwithstanding her apprehensions. While tarrying a day or two in Salem,\r\n\"Sam's\" letter was received in Philadelphia. Friend Goodwin was written\r\nto in the meantime, by a member of the Committee, directly with a view\r\nof making inquires concerning the stray fugitives, and at the same time\r\nto inform her as to how they happened to be coming in the direction\r\nfound by her. While the mind of the friend was much relieved by the\r\nletter she received, she was still in some doubt, as will be seen by the\r\nappended extract from a letter on the subject:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM A. GOODWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    SALEM, 3 mo., 25, '55.\r\n\r\n    DEAR FRIEND:--Thine of the 22d came to hand yesterday noon.\r\n\r\n    I do not believe that any of them are the ones thee wrote about,\r\n    who wanted Dr. Lundy to come for them, and promised they would\r\n    pay his expenses. They had no money, the minister said, but were\r\n    pretty well off for clothes. I gave him all I had and more, but\r\n    it seemed very little for four travelers--only a dollar for\r\n    each--but they will meet with friends and helpers on the way. He\r\n    said they expected to go away to-morrow. I am afraid, it's so\r\n    cold, and one of them had a sore foot, they will not get\r\n    away--it's dangerous staying here. There has been a slave-hunter\r\n    here lately, I was told yesterday, in search of a woman; he\r\n    tracked her to our Alms-house--she had lately been confined and\r\n    was not able to go--he will come back for her and his\r\n    infant--and will not wait long I expect. I want much to get her\r\n    away first--and if one had a C.C. Torney here no doubt it would\r\n    be done; but she will be well guarded. How much I wish the poor\r\n    thing could be secreted in some safe place till she is able to\r\n    travel Northward; but where that could be it's not easy to see.\r\n    I presume the Carolina freed people have arrived ere now. I hope\r\n    they will meet many friends, and be well provided for. Mary\r\n    Davis will be then paid--her cousins have sent her twenty-four\r\n    dollars, as it was not wanted for the purchase money--it was to\r\n    be kept for them when they arrive. I am glad thee did keep the\r\n    ten for the fugitives.\r\n\r\n    Samuel Nixon is now here, just come--a smart young man--they\r\n    will be after him soon. I advise him to hurry on to Canada; he\r\n    will leave here to-morrow, but don't say that he will go\r\n    straight to the city. I would send this by him if he did. I am\r\n    afraid he will loiter about and be taken--do make them go on\r\n    fast--he has left. I could not hear much he said--some who did\r\n    don't like him at all--think him an impostor--a great brag--said\r\n    he was a dentist ten years. He was asked where he came from, but\r\n    would not tell till he looked at the letter that lay on the\r\n    table and that he had just brought back. I don't feel much\r\n    confidence in him--don't believe he is the one thee alluded to.\r\n    He was asked his name--he looked at the letter to find it out.\r\n    Says nobody can make a better set of teeth than he can. He said\r\n    they will go on to-morrow in the stage--he took down the number\r\n    and street of the Anti-slavery office--you will be on your guard\r\n    against imposition--he kept the letter thee sent from Norfolk. I\r\n    had then no doubt of him, and had no objection to it. I now\r\n    rather regret it. I would send it to thee if I had it, but\r\n    perhaps it is of no importance.\r\n\r\n    He wanted the names taken down of nine more who expected to get\r\n    off soon and might come here. He told us to send them to him,\r\n    but did not seem to know where he was going to. He was well\r\n    dressed in fine broad-cloth coat and overcoat, and has a very\r\n    active tongue in his head.\r\n\r\n    But I have said enough--don't want to prejudice thee against\r\n    him, but only be on thy guard, and do not let him deceive thee,\r\n    as I fear he has some of us here.\r\n\r\n    With kind regards,\r\n\r\n    A. GOODWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn due time Samuel and his companions reached Philadelphia, where a\r\ncordial welcome awaited them. The confusion and difficulties into which\r\nthey had fallen, by having to travel an indirect route, were fully\r\nexplained, and to the hearty merriment of the Committee and strangers,\r\nthe dilemma of their good Quaker friend Goodwin at Salem was alluded to.\r\nAfter a sojourn of a day or two in Philadelphia, Samuel and his\r\ncompanions left for New Bedford. Canada was named to them as the safest\r\nplace for all Refugees; but it was in vain to attempt to convince \"Sam\"\r\nthat Canada or any other place on this Continent, was quite equal to New\r\nBedford. His heart was there, and there he was resolved to go--and there\r\nhe did go too, bearing with him his resolute mind, determined, if\r\npossible, to work his way up to an honorable position at his old trade,\r\nDentistry, and that too for his own benefit.\r\n\r\nAided by the Committee, the journey was made safely to the desired\r\nhaven, where many old friends from Norfolk were found. Here our hero was\r\nknown by the name of Dr. Thomas Bayne--he was no longer \"Sam.\" In a\r\nshort time the Dr. commenced his profession in an humble way, while, at\r\nthe same time, he deeply interested himself in his own improvement, as\r\nwell as the improvement of others, especially those who had escaped from\r\nSlavery as he himself had. Then, too, as colored men were voters and,\r\ntherefore, eligible to office in New Bedford, the Doctor's naturally\r\nambitious and intelligent, turn of mind led him to take an interest in\r\npolitics, and before he was a citizen of New Bedford four years, he was\r\nduly elected a member of the City Council. He was also an outspoken\r\nadvocate of the cause of temperance, and was likewise a ready speaker at\r\nAnti-slavery meetings held by his race. Some idea of his abilities, and\r\nthe interest he took in the Underground Rail Road, education, etc., may\r\nbe gathered from the appended letters:\r\n\r\n\r\n    NEW BEDFORD, June 23d, 1855.\r\n\r\n    W. Still:--Sir--I write you this to inform you that I has\r\n    received my things and that you need not say any thing to Bagnul\r\n    about them--I see by the Paper that the under ground Rail Road\r\n    is in operation. Since 2 weeks a go when Saless Party was\r\n    betrayed by that Capt whom we in mass. are so anxious to Learn\r\n    his name--There was others started last Saturday night--They are\r\n    all my old friends and we are waiting their arrival, we hope you\r\n    will look out for them they may come by way of Salem, N.J. if\r\n    they be not overtaken. They are from Norfolk--Times are very\r\n    hard in Canada 2 of our old friends has left Canada and come to\r\n    Bedford for a living. Every thing are so high and wages so low\r\n    They cannot make a living (owing to the War) others are Expected\r\n    shortly--let me hear from Sales and his Party. Get the Name of\r\n    the Capt. that betrayed him let me know if Mrs. Goodwin of Salem\r\n    are at the same place yet--John Austin are with us. C. Lightfoot\r\n    is well and remembers you and family. My business increases more\r\n    since I has got an office. Send me a Norfolk Paper or any other\r\n    to read when convenient.\r\n\r\n    Let me hear from those People as soon as possible. They consist\r\n    of woman and child 2 or 3 men belonging to Marsh Bottimore, L.\r\n    Slosser and Herman & Co--and Turner--all of Norfolk, Va.\r\n\r\n    Truly yours,\r\n\r\n    THOS. BAYNE.\r\n\r\n    Direct to Box No. 516, New Bedford, Mass. Don't direct my\r\n    letters to my office. Direct them to my Box 516. My office is\r\n    66-1/2 William St. The same street the Post office is near the\r\n    city market.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, feeling his educational deficiency in the enlightened city\r\nof New Bedford, did just what every uncultivated man should, devoted\r\nhimself assiduously to study, and even applied himself to abstruse and\r\nhard subjects, medicine, etc., as the following letters will show:\r\n\r\n\r\n    NEW BEDFORD, Jan., 1860.\r\n\r\n    No. 22, Cheapside, opposite City Hall.\r\n\r\n    My Dear Friend:--Yours of the 3d inst. reached me safely in the\r\n    midst of my misfortune. I suppose you have learned that my\r\n    office and other buildings burned down during the recent fire.\r\n    My loss is $550, insured $350.\r\n\r\n    I would have written you before, but I have been to R.I. for\r\n    some time and soon after I returned before I examined the books,\r\n    the fire took place, and this accounts for my delay. In regard\r\n    to the books I am under many obligations to you and all others\r\n    for so great a piece of kindness, and shall ever feel indebted\r\n    to you for the same. I shall esteem them very highly for two\r\n    reasons, first, The way in which they come, that is through and\r\n    by your Vigilance as a colored man helping a colored man to get\r\n    such knowledge as will give the lie to our enemies.\r\n    Secondly--their contents being just the thing I needed at this\r\n    time. My indebtedness to you and all concerned for me in this\r\n    direction is inexpressible. There are some books the Doctor says\r\n    I must have, such as the Medical Dictionary, Physician's\r\n    Dictionary, and a work on Anatomy. These I will have to get, but\r\n    any work that may be of use to a student of anatomy or medicine\r\n    will be thankfully received. You shall hear from me again soon.\r\n\r\n    Truly Yours,\r\n\r\n    THOS. BAYNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    NEW BEDFORD, March 18th, 1861.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Wm. Still:--Dear Sir--Dr. Powell called to see me and\r\n    informed me that you had a medical lexicon (Dictionary) for me.\r\n    If you have such a book for me, it will be very thankfully\r\n    received, and any other book that pertains to the medical or\r\n    dental profession. I am quite limited in means as yet and in\r\n    want of books to prosecute my studies. The books I need most at\r\n    present is such as treat on midwifery, anatomy, &c. But any book\r\n    or books in either of the above mentioned cases will be of use\r\n    to me. You can send them by Express, or by any friend that may\r\n    chance to come this way, but by Express will be the safest way\r\n    to send them. Times are quite dull. This leaves me well and hope\r\n    it may find you and family the same. My regards to your wife and\r\n    all others.\r\n\r\n    Yours, &c.,\r\n\r\n    THOMAS BAYNE,\r\n\r\n    22 Cheapside, opposite City Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus the doctor continued to labor and improve his mind until the war\r\nremoved the hideous institution of Slavery from the nation; but as soon\r\nas the way opened for his return to his old home, New Bedford no longer\r\nhad sufficient attractions to retain him. With all her faults he\r\nconceived that \"Old Virginia\" offered decided inducements for his\r\nreturn. Accordingly he went directly to Norfolk, whence he escaped. Of\r\ncourse every thing was in the utmost confusion and disorder when he\r\nreturned, save where the military held sway. So as soon as the time drew\r\nnear for reorganizing, elections, &c., the doctor was found to be an\r\naspirant for a seat in Congress, and in \"running\" for it, was found to\r\nbe a very difficult candidate to beat. Indeed in the first reports of\r\nthe election his name was amongst the elected; but subsequent counts\r\nproved him to be among the defeated by only a very slight majority.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the doctor's escape, in 1855, he was thirty-one years of\r\nage, a man of medium size, and about as purely colored, as could readily\r\nbe found, with a full share of self-esteem and pluck.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDRY ARRIVALS\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM LOUDON CO., VA., NORFOLK, BALTIMORE, MD., PETERSBURG, VA., &C.,\r\nABOUT THE MONTH OF JUNE, 1855.\r\nArrival 1st.  David Bennett and family.\r\nArrival 2d.   Henry Washington, alias Anthony Hanly, and Henry Stewart.\r\nArrival 3d.   William Nelson and wife, William Thomas, Louisa Bell, and\r\nElias Jasper.\r\nArrival 4th.  Maria Joiner.\r\nArrival 5th.  Richard Green and his brother George.\r\nArrival 6th.  Henry Cromwell.\r\nArrival 7th.  Henry Bohm.\r\nArrival 8th.  Ralph Whiting, James H. Forman, Anthony Atkinson,\r\nArthur Jones, Isaiah Nixon, Joseph Harris, John Morris, Henry Hodges.\r\nArrival 9th.  Robert Jones and wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first arrival to be here noticed consisted of David Bennett, and his\r\nwife Martha, with their two children, a little boy named George, and a\r\nnameless babe one month old. This family journeyed from Loudon county,\r\nVa. David, the husband, had been in bonds under Captain James Taylor.\r\nMartha, the wife, and her two children were owned by George Carter.\r\nMartha's master was represented as a very barbarous and cruel man to the\r\nslaves. He made a common practice of flogging females when stripped\r\nnaked. This was the emphatic testimony of Martha. Martha declared that\r\nshe had been so stripped, and flogged by him after her marriage. The\r\nstory of this interesting young mother, who was about twenty-seven years\r\nof age, was painful to the ear, particularly as the earnestness and\r\nintelligence of this poor, bruised, and mangled soul bore such strong\r\nevidence to the truthfulness of her statements. During the painful\r\ninterview the mind would involuntarily picture this demon, only as the\r\nrepresentative of thousands in the South using the same relentless sway\r\nover men and women; and this fleeing victim and her little ones, before\r\nescaping, only as sharers of a common lot with many other mothers and\r\nchildren, whose backs were daily subjected to the lash. If on such an\r\noccasion it was hard to find fitting words of sympathy, or adequate\r\nexpressions of indignation, the pleasure of being permitted to give aid\r\nand comfort to such was in part a compensation and a relief. David, the\r\nhusband of this woman, was about thirty-two years of age. No further\r\nnotice was made of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArrival No. 2 consisted of Henry Washington, alias Anthony Hanly, and\r\nHenry Stewart. Henry left Norfolk and a \"very mild master,\" known by the\r\nname of \"Seth March,\" out of sheer disgust for the patriarchal\r\ninstitution. Directly after speaking of his master in such flattering\r\nterms he qualified the \"mild,\" &c. by adding that he was excessively\r\nclose in money matters. In proof of this assertion, Henry declared, that\r\nout of his hire he was only allowed $1.50 per week to pay his board,\r\nclothe himself, and defray all other expenses; leaving no room whatever\r\nfor him to provide for his wife. It was, therefore, a never-failing\r\nsource of unhappiness to be thus debarred, and it was wholly on this\r\naccount that he \"took out,\" as he did, and at the time that he did. His\r\nwife's name was \"Sally.\" She too was a slave, but \"had not been treated\r\nroughly.\"\r\n\r\nFor fifty long years Henry had been in the grasp of this merciless\r\nsystem--constrained to toil for the happiness of others, to make them\r\ncomfortable, rich, indolent, and tyrannical. To say that he was like a\r\nbird out of a cage, conveys in no sense whatever the slightest idea of\r\nhis delight in escaping from the prison house. And yet, his pleasure was\r\nsadly marred by the reflection that his bosom companion was still in\r\nbondage in the gloomy prison-house. Henry was a man of dark color, well\r\nmade, and of a reflective turn of mind. On arriving in Canada, he\r\nmanifested his gratitude through Rev. H. Wilson, as follows--\r\n\r\n\r\n    ST. CATHARINES, Aug. 20th, 1855.\r\n\r\n    DEAR BR. STILL:--I am requested by Henry Washington to inform\r\n    you that he got through safe, and is here in good business. He\r\n    returns to you his sincere thanks for your attention to him on\r\n    his way. I had the pleasure of receiving seven fugitives last\r\n    week. Send them on, and may God speed them in the flight. I\r\n    would like to have a miracle-working power, that I could give\r\n    wings to them all so that they could come faster than by\r\n    Railroads either underground or above.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n\r\n    HIRAM WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile he was thus hopefully succeeding in Canada, separated from his\r\ncompanion by many hundreds of miles, death came and liberated her from\r\nthe yoke, as the subjoined letter indicates--\r\n\r\n\r\n    ST. CATHARINES, C.W. Nov. 12, 1855.\r\n\r\n    MR. WILLIAM STILL:--_Dear Sir_:--I have received a letter from\r\n    Joseph G. Selden a friend in Norfolk, Va., informing me of the\r\n    death of my wife, who deceased since I saw you here; he also\r\n    informs me that my clothing will be forwarded to you by Jupiter\r\n    White, who now has it in his charge. You will therefore do me a\r\n    great favor, if you will be so good as to forward them to me at\r\n    this place St. Catharines, C.W.\r\n\r\n    The accompanying letter is the one received from Mr. Selden\r\n    which I send you, that you may see that it is all right. You\r\n    will please give my respects to Mrs. Still and family. Most\r\n    respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n    HENRY WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Stewart, who accompanied the above mentioned traveler to Canada,\r\nhad fled a short while before from Plymouth, North Carolina. James\r\nMonroe Woodhouse, a farmer, claimed Stewart as his property, and \"hired\r\nhim out\" for $180 per annum. As a master, Woodhouse was considered to be\r\nof the \"moderate\" type, according to Stewart's judgment. But respecting\r\nmoney matters (when his slaves wanted a trifle), \"he was very hard. He\r\ndid not flog, but would not give a slave a cent of money upon any\r\nconsideration.\"\r\n\r\nIt was by procuring a pass to Norfolk, that Henry managed to escape.\r\nAlthough a father and a husband, having a wife (Martha) and two children\r\n(Mary Ann and Susan Jane), he felt that his lot as a slave utterly\r\ndebarred him from discharging his duty to them; that he could exercise\r\nno rights or privileges whatever, save as he might obtain permission\r\nfrom his master. In the matter of separation, even although the ties of\r\nhusband and wife, parents and children were most closely knit, his\r\nreason dictated that he would be justified in freeing himself if\r\npossible; indeed, he could not endure the pressure of Slavery any\r\nlonger. Although only twenty-three years of age, the burdens that he had\r\nbeen called upon to bear, made his naturally intelligent mind chafe to\r\nan unusual degree, especially when reflecting upon a continued life of\r\nSlavery. When the time decided upon for his flight arrived, he said\r\nnothing to his wife on the subject, but secured his pass and took his\r\ndeparture for Norfolk. On arriving there, he sought out an Underground\r\nRail Road captain, and arranged with him to bring him to Philadelphia.\r\nWhether the sorrow-stricken wife ever afterwards heard of her husband,\r\nor the father of his two little children, the writer is unable to say.\r\nIt is possible that this narrative may reveal to the mother and her\r\noffspring (if they are still living), the first ray of light concerning\r\nthe missing one. Indeed it is not unreasonable to suppose, that\r\nthousands of anxious wives, husbands and children, who have been\r\nscattered in every direction by Slavery, will never be able to learn as\r\nmuch of their lost ones as is contained in this brief account of Henry\r\nStewart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArrival No. 3, brought William Nelson, his wife, Susan, and son, William\r\nThomas, together with Louisa Bell, and Elias Jasper. These travelers\r\navailed themselves of the schooner of Captain B. who allowed them to\r\nembark at Norfolk, despite the search laws of Virginia. It hardly need\r\nbe said, however, that it was no trifling matter in those days, to evade\r\nthe law. Captains and captives, in order to succeed, found that it\r\nrequired more than ordinary intelligence and courage, shrewdness and\r\ndetermination, and at the same time, a very ardent appreciation of\r\nliberty, without which, there could be no success. The simple\r\nannouncement then, that a party of this number had arrived from Norfolk,\r\nor Richmond, or Petersburg, gave the Committee unusual satisfaction. It\r\nmade them quite sure that there was pluck and brain somewhere.\r\n\r\nThese individuals, in a particularly marked degree, possessed the\r\nqualities that greatly encouraged the efforts of the Committee. William\r\nNelson, was a man of a dark chestnut color, medium size, with more than\r\nan ordinary degree of what might be termed \"mother wit.\" Apparently,\r\nWilliam possessed well settled convictions, touching the questions of\r\nmorals and religion, despite the overflowing tide of corruption and\r\nspurious religious teachings consequent on the existing pro-slavery\r\nusages all around him. He was a member of the Methodist Church, under\r\nthe charge of the Rev. Mr. Jones. For twenty years, William had served\r\nin the capacity of a \"packer\" under Messrs. Turner and White, who held a\r\ndeed for William as their legal property. While he declared that he had\r\nbeen very \"tightly worked\" he nevertheless admitted that he had been\r\ndealt with in a mild manner in some respects.\r\n\r\nFor his board and clothing, William had been allowed $1.50 per week.\r\nTruly a small sum for a hard-working man with a family--yet this was far\r\nmore than many slaves received from their masters. In view of receiving\r\nthis small pittance, he had toiled hard--doing over-work in order to\r\nmake \"buckle and strap meet.\" Once he had been sold on the\r\nauction-block. A sister of his had also shared the same fate. While\r\nseriously contemplating his life as a slave, he was soon led to the\r\nconclusion that it was his duty to bend his entire energies towards\r\nfreeing himself and his family if possible. The idea of not being able\r\nto properly provide for his family rendered him quite unhappy; he\r\ntherefore resolved to seek a passage North, via the Underground Rail\r\nRoad. To any captain who would aid him in the matter, he resolved to\r\noffer a large reward, and determined that the amount should only be\r\nlimited by his inability to increase it. Finally, after much anxious\r\npreparation, agreement was entered into with Captain B., on behalf of\r\nhimself, wife, child, and Louisa Bell, which was mutually satisfactory\r\nto all concerned, and afforded great hope to William. In due time the\r\nagreement was carried into effect, and all arrived safely and were\r\ndelivered into the hands of the Committee in Philadelphia. The fare of\r\nthe four cost $240, and William was only too grateful to think, that a\r\nCaptain could be found who would risk his own liberty in thus aiding a\r\nslave to freedom.\r\n\r\nThe Committee gladly gave them aid and succor, and agreed with William\r\nthat the Captain deserved all that he received for their deliverance.\r\nThe arrival of William, wife, and child in Canada was duly announced by\r\nthe agent at St. Catharines, Rev. H. Wilson, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ST. CATHARINES, C.W., June 28th, 1855.\r\n\r\n    MR. WM. STILL:--_My Dear Friend_:--I am happy to announce the\r\n    safe arrival of Thomas Russell with his wife and child. They\r\n    have just arrived. I am much pleased with their appearance. I\r\n    shall do what I can for their comfort and encouragement. They\r\n    stopt at Elmira from Monday night till this morning, hoping that\r\n    Lucy Bell would come up and join them at that place. They are\r\n    very anxious to hear from her, as they have failed of meeting\r\n    with her on the way or finding her here in advance of them. They\r\n    wish to hear from you as soon as you can write, and would like\r\n    to know if you have forwarded Lucy on, and if so, what route you\r\n    sent her. They send their kind respects to you and your family\r\n    and many thanks for your kindness to them.\r\n\r\n    They wish you to inquire after Lucy if any harm has befallen her\r\n    after her leaving Philadelphia. Please write promptly in my\r\n    care.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly in the love of freedom,\r\n\r\n    HIRAM WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man who came to us as Wm. Nelson, is now known only as \"Thomas\r\nRussell.\" It may here be remarked, that, owing to the general custom of\r\nchanging names, as here instanced, it is found difficult to tell to whom\r\nthe letters severally refer. Where the old and new names were both\r\ncarefully entered on the book there is no difficulty, of course, but it\r\nwas not always thus.\r\n\r\nSusan Bell, the wife of William, was about thirty years of age, of a\r\ndark color, rather above medium size, well-made, good-looking, and\r\nintelligent--quite equal to her husband, and appeared to have his\r\naffections undividedly. She was owned by Thomas Baltimore, with whom she\r\nhad lived for the last seven years. She stated that during a part of her\r\nlife she had been treated in a \"mild manner.\" She had no complaint to\r\nmake until after the marriage of her master. Under the new wife and\r\nmistress, Susan found a very marked change for the worse. She fared\r\nbadly enough then. The mistress, on every trifling occasion for\r\ncomplaint, was disposed to hold the auction-block up to Susan, and would\r\nlikewise influence her husband to do the same. From the fact, that four\r\nof Susan's sisters had been sold away to \"parts unknown,\" she was not\r\nprepared to relish these almost daily threats from her irritable\r\nmistress, so she became as anxious for a trip on the Underground Rail\r\nRoad as was her husband.\r\n\r\nAbout one hundred miles away in the country, her father, mother, three\r\nbrothers, and one sister were living; but she felt that she could not\r\nremain a slave on their account. Susan's owner had already fixed a price\r\non her and her child, twenty-two months old, which was one thousand\r\ndollars. From this fate she was saved only by her firm resolution to\r\nseek her freedom.\r\n\r\nLouisa Bell was also of Wm. Nelson's party, and a fair specimen of a\r\nnice-looking, wide awake woman; of a chestnut color, twenty-eight years\r\nof age. She was the wife of a free man, but the slave of L. Stasson, a\r\nconfectioner. The almost constant ringing in her ears of the\r\nauction-block, made her most miserable, especially as she had once\r\nsuffered terribly by being sold, and had likewise seen her mother, and\r\nfive sisters placed in the same unhappy situation, the thought of which\r\nnever ceased to be most painful. In reflecting upon the course which she\r\nwas about to pursue in order to free herself from the prison-house, she\r\nfelt more keenly than ever for her little children, and readily imagined\r\nhow sadly she would mourn while thinking of them hundreds of miles\r\ndistant, growing up only to be slaves. And particularly would her\r\nthoughts dwell upon her boy, six years of age; full old enough to feel\r\ndeeply the loss of his mother, but without hope of ever seeing her\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nHeart-breaking as were these reflections, she resolved to leave Robert\r\nand Mary in the hands of God, and escape, if possible from her terrible\r\nthraldom. Her plan was submitted to her husband; he acquiesced fully and\r\npromised to follow her as soon as an opportunity might present itself.\r\nAlthough the ordeal that she was called upon to pass through was of the\r\nmost trying nature she bravely endured the journey through to Canada. On\r\nher arrival there the Rev. H. Wilson wrote on behalf of herself, and the\r\ncause as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ST. CATHERINES, C.W. July 6th, 1855.\r\n\r\n    DEAR BR. STILL:--I have just received your letters touching\r\n    U.G.R.R. operations. All is right. Jasper and Mrs. Bell got here\r\n    on Saturday last, and I think I dropt you a line announcing the\r\n    fact. I write again thus soon because two more by name of Smith,\r\n    John and Wm., have arrived the present week and were anxious to\r\n    have me inform you that they are safely landed and free in this\r\n    refuge land. They wish me to communicate their kind regards to\r\n    you and others who have aided them. They have found employment\r\n    and are likely to do well. The 5 of last week have gone over to\r\n    Toronto. I gave them letters to a friend there after furnishing\r\n    them as well as I could with such clothing as they required. I\r\n    am afraid that I am burdening you too much with postage, but\r\n    can't help doing so unless I fail to write at all, as my means\r\n    are not half equal to the expenses to which I am subject.\r\n\r\n    Faithfully and truly yours,\r\n\r\n    HIRAM WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nElias Jasper, who was also a fellow-passenger with Wm. Nelson and Co.,\r\nwas noticed thus on the Underground Rail Road: Age thirty-two years,\r\ncolor dark, features good, and gifted both with his tongue and hands. He\r\nhad worked more or less at the following trades: Rope-making,\r\ncarpentering, engineering, and photographing. It was in this latter\r\ncalling that he was engaged when the Underground Rail Road movement\r\nfirst arrested his attention, and so continued until his departure.\r\n\r\nFor several years he had been accustomed to hire his time, for which he\r\nhad been required to pay $10 per month. In acquiring the above trades he\r\nhad been at no expense to his master, as he had learned them solely by\r\nhis own perseverance, endowed as he was with a considerable share of\r\ngenius. Occasionally he paid for lessons, the money being earned by his\r\nover-work. His master, Bayham, was a \"retired gentleman.\"\r\n\r\nElias had been sold once, and had suffered in various other ways,\r\nparticularly from being flogged. He left his wife, Mary, but no child.\r\nOf his intention to leave Elias saw not how to impart to his wife, lest\r\nshe should in some way let the \"cat out of the bag.\" She was owned by a\r\nMiss Portlock, and had been treated \"tolerably well,\" having had the\r\nprivilege of hiring her time. She had $55 to pay for this favor, which\r\namount she raised by washing, etc. Elias was a member of the Methodist\r\nChurch, as were all of his comrades, and well did they remember the\r\noft-repeated lesson, \"Servants obey your masters,\" etc. They soon\r\nunderstood this kind of preaching after breathing free air. The market\r\nvalue of Elias was placed at $1200.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArrival, No. 4. Maria Joiner. Captain F. arrived, from Norfolk, with the\r\nabove named passenger, the way not being open to risk any other on that\r\noccasion. This seemed rather slow business with this voyager, for he was\r\nusually accustomed to bringing more than one. However, as this arrival\r\nwas only one day later than the preceding one noticed, and came from the\r\nsame place, the Committee concluded, that they had much reason for\r\nrejoicing nevertheless. As in the case of a great number among the\r\noppressed of the South, when simply looking at Maria, no visible marks\r\nof ill usage in any way were discernible. Indeed, as she then appeared\r\nat the age of thirty-three, a fine, fresh, and healthy-looking mulatto\r\nwoman, nine out of every ten would have been impressed with the idea,\r\nthat she had never been subjected to hard treatment; in other words,\r\nthat she had derived her full share of advantages from the \"Patriarchal\r\nInstitution.\" The appearance of just such persons in Southern cities had\r\noften led Northerners, when traveling in those parts, to regard the lot\r\nof slaves as quite comfortable. But the story of Maria, told in an\r\nearnest and intelligent manner, was at once calculated to dissipate the\r\nidea of a \"comfortable\" existence in a state of bondage. She frankly\r\nadmitted, however, that prior to the death of her old master, she was\r\nfavorably treated, compared with many others; but, unfortunately, after\r\nhis death, she had fallen into the hands of one of the old man's\r\ndaughters, from whom, she declared, that she had received continued\r\nabuse, especially when said daughter was under the influence of liquor.\r\nAt such times she was very violent. Being spirited, Maria could not\r\nconsent to suffer on as a slave in this manner. Consequently she began\r\nto cogitate how she might escape from her mistress (Catharine Gordon),\r\nand reach a free State. None other than the usual trying and hazardous\r\nways could be devised--which was either to be stowed away in the hold of\r\na schooner, or concealed amongst the rubbish of a steamer, where, for\r\nthe time being, the extreme suffering was sure to tax every nerve even\r\nof the most valiant-hearted men. The daily darkening prospects\r\nconstrained her to decide, that she was willing to suffer, not only in\r\nadopting this mode of travel, but on the other hand, that she had better\r\nbe dead than remain under so cruel a woman as her mistress. Maria's\r\nhusband and sister (no other relatives are noticed), were naturally\r\nformidable barriers in the way of her escape. Notwithstanding her\r\nattachment to them, she fully made up her mind to be free. Immediately\r\nshe took the first prerequisite step, which was to repair to a place of\r\nconcealment with a friend in the city, and there, like the man at the\r\npool, wait until her turn came to be conveyed thence to a free State. In\r\nthis place she was obliged to wait eight long months, enduring daily\r\nsuffering in various ways, especially during the winter season. But,\r\nwith martyr-like faith, she endured to the end, and was eventually saved\r\nfrom the hell of Slavery. Maria was appraised at $800.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArrival No. 5. Richard Green, alias Wm. Smith, and his brother George.\r\nThese young brothers fled from George Chambers of Baltimore. The elder\r\nbrother was twenty-five, the younger twenty-three. Both were tall and\r\nwell made and of a chestnut color, and possessed a good degree of\r\nnatural ability. When desiring to visit their parents, their request was\r\npositively refused by their owner. Taking offence at this step, both\r\nmutually resolved to run away at the earliest opportunity. Thus in\r\naccordance with well premeditated plans, they set out and unobstructedly\r\narrived in Philadelphia. At first it was simply very pleasant to take\r\nthem by the hand and welcome them; then to listen for a few moments to\r\ntheir intelligent narration of how they escaped, the motives that\r\nprompted them, etc. But further inquiries soon brought out incidents of\r\nthe most thrilling and touching nature--not with regard to hardships\r\nwhich they had personally experienced, but in relation to outrages which\r\nhad been perpetrated upon their mother. Such simple facts as were then\r\nwritten are substantially as follows: Nearly thirty years prior to the\r\nescape of Richard and his brother their mother was in very bad health,\r\nso much so that physicians regarded her incurable. Her owner was\r\nevidently fully impressed with the belief that instead of being\r\nprofitable to him, she might be an expense, which he could not possibly\r\nobviate, while he retained her as a slave. Now there was a way to get\r\nout of this dilemma. He could emancipate her and throw the\r\nresponsibility of her support upon, herself. Accordingly he drew up\r\npapers, called for his wife's mother to witness them, then formally put\r\nthem into the hands of the invalid slave woman (Dinah), assuring her at\r\nthe same time, that she was free--being fully released as set forth in\r\nher papers. \"Take notice I have no more claim on you nor you on me from\r\nthis time.\" Marvellous liberality! After working the life out of a\r\nwoman, in order that he should not have her to bury, he becomes hastily\r\nin favor of freedom. He is, however, justified by the laws of Maryland.\r\nComplaint, therefore, would simply amount to nothing. In the nature of\r\nthe case Dinah was now free, but she was not wholly alone in the world.\r\nShe had a husband, named Jacob Green, who was owned by Nathan Childs for\r\na term of years only, at the expiration of which time he was to be free.\r\nAll lived then in Talbot county, Md. At the appointed time Jacob's\r\nbondage ended, and he concluded that he might succeed better by moving\r\nto Baltimore. Indeed the health of his wife was so miserable that\r\nnothing in his old home seemed to offer any inducement in the way of a\r\nlivelihood. So off they moved to Baltimore. After a time, under careful\r\nand kind treatment, the faithful Jacob was greatly encouraged by\r\nperceiving that the health of his companion was gradually\r\nimproving--signs indicated, that she might yet become a well woman. The\r\nhopes of husband and wife, in this particular, were, in the lapse of\r\ntime, fully realized. Dinah was as well as ever, and became the mother\r\nof another child--a little boy. Everything seemed to be going on\r\nhappily, and they had no apparent reason to suspect any troubles other\r\nthan such as might naturally have to be encountered in a state of\r\npoverty and toil.\r\n\r\nThe unfettered boy was healthy, and made rapid advance in a few years.\r\nThat any one should ever claim him was never for a moment feared.\r\n\r\nThe old master, however, becoming tired of country life, had also moved\r\nto Baltimore. How, they knew not, but he had heard of the existence of\r\nthis boy.\r\n\r\nThat he might satisfy himself on this point, he one day very slyly\r\napproached the house with George. No sooner was the old man within the\r\nenclosures than he asked Dinah, \"Whose child is that?\" pointing to the\r\nboy. \"Ask Jacob,\" was the reply of the mother. The question was then put\r\nto Jacob, the father of the boy. \"I did not think that you would ask\r\nsuch a question, or that you would request anything like that,\" Jacob\r\nremarked, naturally somewhat nervous, but he added, \"I have the\r\nprivilege of having any one I please in my house.\" \"Where is he from?\"\r\nagain demanded the master. The father repeated, \"I have a right to\r\nhave,\" etc., \"I am my own man,\" etc. \"I have found out whose he is,\" the\r\nhunter said. \"I am going presently to take him home with me.\" At this\r\njuncture he seized the little fellow, at the same time calling out,\r\n\"Dinah, put his clothes on.\" By this time the father too had seized hold\r\nof the child. Mustering courage, the father said, \"Take notice that you\r\nare not in the country, pulling and hauling people about.\" \"I will have\r\nhim or I will leave my heart's blood in the house,\" was the savage\r\ndeclaration of the master. In his rage he threatened to shoot the\r\nfather. In the midst of the excitement George called in two officers to\r\nsettle the trouble. \"What are you doing here?\" said the officers to the\r\nslave-holder. \"I am after my property--this boy,\" he exclaimed. \"Have\r\nyou ever seen it before?\" they inquired. \"No,\" said the slave-holder.\r\n\"Then how do you know that he belongs to you?\" inquired the officers. \"I\r\nbelieve he is mine,\" replied the slave-holder.\r\n\r\nAll the parties concerned were then taken by the officers before an\r\nAlderman. The father owned the child but the mother denied it. The\r\nAlderman then decided that the child should be given to the father.\r\n\r\nThe slave-holder having thus failed, was unwilling, nevertheless, to\r\nrelinquish his grasp. Whereupon he at once claimed the mother. Of course\r\nhe was under the necessity of resorting to the Courts in order to\r\nestablish his claim. Fortunately the mother had securely preserved the\r\npaper given her by her master so many years before, releasing her.\r\nNotwithstanding this the suit was pending nearly a year before the case\r\nwas decided. Everything was so clear the mother finally gained the suit.\r\nThis decision was rendered only about two months prior to the escape of\r\nRichard and George.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArrival No. 6. Henry Cromwell. This passenger fled from Baltimore\r\ncounty, Md. The man that he escaped from was a farmer by the name of\r\nWilliam Roberts, who also owned seven other young slaves. Of his\r\ntreatment of his slaves nothing was recorded.\r\n\r\nHenry was about six feet high, quite black, visage thin, age\r\ntwenty-five. He left neither wife, parents, brothers nor sisters to\r\ngrieve after him. In making his way North he walked of nights from his\r\nhome to Harrisburg, Pa., and there availed himself of a passage on a\r\nfreight car coming to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArrival No. 7. Henry Bohm. Henry came from near Norfolk, Va. He was\r\nabout twenty-five years of age, and a fair specimen of a stout man,\r\npossessed of more than ordinary physical strength. As to whom he fled\r\nfrom, how he had been treated, or how he reached Philadelphia, the\r\nrecord book is silent. Why this is the case cannot now be accounted for,\r\nunless the hurry of getting him off forbade sufficient delay to note\r\ndown more of the particulars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArrival No. 8. Ralph Whiting, James H. Forman, Anthony Atkinson, Arthur\r\nJones, Isaiah Nixon, Joseph Harris, John Morris, and Henry Hodges. A\r\nnumerous party like this had the appearance of business. They were all\r\nyoung and hopeful, and belonged to the more intelligent and promising of\r\ntheir race. They were capable of giving the best of reasons for the\r\nendeavors they were making to escape to a free country.\r\n\r\nThey imparted to the Committee much information respecting their several\r\nsituations, together with the characters of their masters in relation to\r\ndomestic matters, and the customs and usages under which they had been\r\nseverally held to service--all of which was listened to with deep\r\ninterest. But it was not an easy matter, after having been thus\r\nentertained, to write out the narratives of eight such persons. Hundreds\r\nof pages would hardly have contained a brief account of the most\r\ninteresting portion of their histories. It was deemed sufficient to\r\nenter their names and their forsaken homes, etc., as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Ralph was twenty-six years of age, five feet ten inches high, dark,\r\nwell made, intelligent, and a member of the Methodist Church. He was\r\nclaimed by Geo. W. Kemp, Esq., cashier of the Exchange Bank of Norfolk,\r\nVa. Ralph gave Mr. Kemp the credit of being a 'moderate man' to his\r\nslaves. Ralph was compelled to leave his wife, Lydia, and two children,\r\nAnna Eliza, and Cornelius.\"\r\n\r\n\"James was twenty-three years of age, dark mulatto, nearly six feet\r\nhigh, and of prepossessing appearance. He fled from James Saunders, Esq.\r\nNothing, save the desire to be free, prompted James to leave his old\r\nsituation and master. His parents and two sisters he was obliged to\r\nleave in Norfolk.\"\r\n\r\nTwo brief letters from James, one concerning his \"sweet-heart,\" whom he\r\nleft in Norfolk, the other giving an account of her arrival in Canada\r\nand marriage thereafter will, doubtless, be read with interest. They are\r\nhere given as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    NIAGARA FALLS, June 5th, 1856. MR. STILL:--Sir--I take my pen in\r\n    hand to write you theas few lines to let you know that I am well\r\n    at present and hope theas few lines may find you the same. Sir\r\n    my object in writing to you is that I expect a young Lady by the\r\n    name of Miss Mariah Moore, from Norfolk, Virginia. She will\r\n    leave Norfolk on the 13th of this month in the Steamship\r\n    Virginia for Philadelphia you will oblige me very much by seeing\r\n    her safely on the train of cars that leaves Philadelphia for the\r\n    Suspension Bridge Niagara Falls pleas to tell the Lady to\r\n    telegraph to me what time she will leave Philadelphia so i may\r\n    know what time to meet her at the Suspension Bridge my Brother\r\n    Isaac Porman send his love also his family to you and your\r\n    family they are all well at present pleas to give my respects to\r\n    Mr. Harry Londay, also Miss Margaret Cunigan, no more at\r\n    present.\r\n\r\n    I remain your friend,\r\n\r\n    JAMES H. FORMAN.\r\n\r\n    When you telegraph to me direct to the International Hotel,\r\n    Niagara Falls, N.Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    NIAGARA FALLS, July 24th, 1856.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:--I take this opportunity of writing these few lines to\r\n    you hoping that they may find you enjoying good health as these\r\n    few lines leave me at present. I thank you for your kindness.\r\n    Miss Moore arrived here on the 30th of June and I was down to\r\n    the cars to receive her. I thought I would have written to you\r\n    before, but I thought I would wait till I got married. I got\r\n    married on the 22d of July in the English Church Canada about 11\r\n    o'clock my wife sends all her love to you and your wife and all\r\n    enquiring friends please to kiss your two children for her and\r\n    she says she is done crying and I am glad to hear she enjoyed\r\n    herself so well in Philadelphia give my respects to Miss\r\n    Margaret Cuningham and I am glad to hear her sister arrived my\r\n    father sends his respects to you no more at present but remain\r\n    your friend,\r\n\r\n    JAMES H. FORMAN.\r\n\r\n    Direct your letter to the International Hotel, Niagara Falls.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnthony was thirty-six years of age, and by blood, was quite as nearly\r\nrelated to the Anglo-Saxon as the Anglo-African. He was nevertheless,\r\nphysically a fine specimen of a man. He was about six feet high, and\r\nbore evidence of having picked up a considerable amount of intelligence\r\nconsidering his opportunities. He had been sold three times. Anthony was\r\ndecidedly opposed to having to pass through this ordeal a fourth time,\r\ntherefore, the more he meditated over his condition, the more determined\r\nhe became to seek out an Underground Rail Road agent, and make his way\r\nto Canada.\r\n\r\nConcluding that Josiah Wells, who claimed him, had received a thousand\r\ntimes too much of his labor already, Anthony was in a fit state of mind\r\nto make a resolute effort to gain his freedom. He had a wife, but no\r\nchildren. His father, one sister, and two brothers were all dear to him,\r\nbut all being slaves \"one could not help the other,\" Anthony reasoned,\r\nand wisely too. So, at the command of the captain, he was ready to bear\r\nhis part of the suffering consequent upon being concealed in the hold of\r\na vessel, where but little air could penetrate.\r\n\r\nArthur was forty-one years of age, six feet high--chestnut color, well\r\nmade, and possessed good native faculties needing cultivation. He\r\nescaped from a farmer, by the name of John Jones, who was classed, as to\r\nnatural temperament, amongst \"moderate slave-holders.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wanted my liberty,\" said Arthur promptly and emphatically, and he\r\ndeclared that was the cause of his escape. He left his mother, two\r\nsisters, and three brothers in Slavery.\r\n\r\nIsaiah was about twenty-two, small of stature, but smart, and of a\r\nsubstantially black complexion. He had been subjected to very hard\r\ntreatment under Samuel Simmons who claimed him, and on this account he\r\nwas first prompted to leave. His mother and three brothers he left in\r\nbondage.\r\n\r\nJoseph was twenty-three years of age, and was, in every way,\r\n\"likely-looking.\" According to the laws of Slavery, he was the property\r\nof David Morris, who was entitled to be ranked amongst the more\r\ncompassionate slave-holders of the South. Yet, Joseph was not satisfied,\r\ndeprived of his freedom. He had not known hardships as many had, but it\r\nwas not in him notwithstanding, to be contented as a slave. In leaving,\r\nhe had to \"tear himself away\" from his parents, three brothers, and two\r\nsisters.\r\n\r\nHenry escaped from S. Simmons of Plymouth, North Carolina, and was a\r\nfellow-servant with Isaiah. Simmons was particularly distinguished for\r\nhis tyrannical rule and treatment of his slaves--so Henry and Isaiah had\r\nthe good sense to withdraw from under his yoke, very young in life;\r\nHenry being twenty-three.\r\n\r\nJohn was about twenty-one years of age, five feet eight inches high,\r\ndark color, and well-grown for his years. Before embarking, he had\r\nendured seven months of hard suffering from being secreted, waiting for\r\nan opportunity to escape. It was to keep his master from selling him,\r\nthat he was thus induced to secrete himself. After he had remained away\r\nsome months, he resolved to suffer on until his friends could manage to\r\nprocure him a passage on the Underground Rail Road. With this determined\r\nspirit he did not wait in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArrival No. 9. Robert Jones and wife:--In the majority of cases, in\r\norder to effect the escape of either, sad separations between husbands\r\nand wives were unavoidable. Fortunately, it was not so in this case. In\r\njourneying from the house of bondage, Robert and his wife were united\r\nboth in sympathies and in struggles. Robert had experienced \"hard times\"\r\njust in what way, however, was not recorded; his wife had been\r\ndifferently treated, not being under the same taskmaster as her husband.\r\nAt the time of their arrival all that was recorded of their bondage is\r\nas follows--\r\n\r\nAugust 2d, 1855, Robert Jones and wife, arrived from Petersburg, Va.\r\nRobert is about thirty-five, chestnut color, medium size, of good\r\nmanners, intelligent, had been owned by Thomas N. Lee, \"a very hard\r\nman.\" Robert left because he \"wanted his liberty--always had from a\r\nboy.\" Eliza, his wife, is about forty years of age, chestnut color,\r\nnice-looking, and well-dressed. She belonged to Eliza H. Richie, who was\r\ncalled a \"moderate woman\" towards her slaves. Notwithstanding the\r\nlimited space occupied in noting them on the record book, the Committee\r\nregarded them as being among the most worthy and brave travelers passing\r\nover the Underground Rail Road, and felt well satisfied that such\r\nspecimens of humanity would do credit in Canada, not only to themselves,\r\nbut to their race.\r\n\r\nRobert had succeeded in learning to read and write tolerably well, and\r\nhad thought much over the condition and wrongs of the race, and seemed\r\nto be eager to be where he could do something to lift his\r\nfellow-sufferers up to a higher plane of liberty and manhood. After an\r\ninterview with Robert and his wife, in every way so agreeable, they were\r\nforwarded on in the usual manner, to Canada. While enjoying the sweets\r\nof freedom in Canada, he was not the man to keep his light under a\r\nbushel. He seemed to have a high appreciation of the potency of the pen,\r\nand a decidedly clear idea that colored men needed to lay hold of many\r\nenterprises with resolution, in order to prove themselves qualified to\r\nrise equally with other branches of the human family. Some of his\r\nletters, embracing his views, plans and suggestions, were so encouraging\r\nand sensible, that the Committee was in the habit of showing them to\r\nfriendly persons, and indeed, extracts of some of his letters were\r\ndeemed of sufficient importance to publish. One alone, taken from many\r\nletters received from him, must here suffice to illustrate his\r\nintelligence and efforts as a fugitive and citizen in Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Hamilton, C.W., August 9th, 1856.\r\n\r\n    MR. WM. STILL;--_Dear Friend_:--I take this opportunity of\r\n    writing you these few lines to inform you of my health, which is\r\n    good at present, &c. * * * *\r\n\r\n    I was talking to you about going to Liberia, when I saw you\r\n    last, and did intend to start this fall, but I since looked at\r\n    the condition of the colored people in Canada. I thought I would\r\n    try to do something for their elevation as a nation, to place\r\n    them in the proper position to stand where they ought to stand.\r\n    In order to do this, I have undertaken to get up a military\r\n    company amongst them. They laughed at me to undertake such a\r\n    thing; but I did not relax my energies. I went and had an\r\n    interview with Major J.T. Gilepon, told him what my object was,\r\n    he encouraged me to go on, saying that he would do all he could\r\n    for the accomplishment of my object. He referred to _Sir Allan\r\n    McNab, &c._ * * * * I took with me Mr. J.H. Hill to see him--he\r\n    told me that it should be done, and required us to write a\r\n    petition to the _Governor General_, which has been done. * * * *\r\n    The company is already organized. Mr. Howard was elected\r\n    Captain; J.H. Hill, 1st Lieutenant; Hezekiah Hill, Ensign;\r\n    Robert Jones, 1st Sergeant. The company's name is, Queen\r\n    Victoria's Rifle Guards. You may, by this, see what I have been\r\n    doing since I have been in Canada. When we receive our\r\n    appointments by the Government. I will send by express, my\r\n    daguerreotype in uniform.\r\n\r\n    My respects, &c. &c., Robert Jones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAVY REWARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Two Thousand Six Hundred Dollars Reward--Ran away from the\r\n    subscriber, on Saturday night, November 15th, 1856, Josiah and\r\n    William Bailey, and Peter Pennington. Joe is about 5 feet 10\r\n    inches in height, of a chestnut color, bald head, with a\r\n    remarkable scar on one of his cheeks, not positive on which it\r\n    is, but think it is on the left, under the eye, has intelligent\r\n    countenance, active, and well-made. He is about 28 years old.\r\n    Bill is of a darker color, about 5 feet 8 inches in height,\r\n    stammers a little when confused, well-made, and older than Joe,\r\n    well dressed, but may have pulled kearsey on over their other\r\n    clothes. Peter is smaller than either the others, about 25 years\r\n    of age, dark chestnut color, 5 feet 7 or 8 inches high.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    A reward of fifteen hundred dollars will be given to any person\r\n    who will apprehend the said Joe Bailey, and lodge him safely in\r\n    the jail at Easton, Talbot Co., Md., and $300 for Bill and $800\r\n    for Peter.\r\n\r\n    W.R. Hughlett\r\n\r\n    John C. Henry,\r\n\r\n    T. Wright.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen this arrival made its appearance, it was at first sight quite\r\nevident that one of the company was a man of more than ordinary parts,\r\nboth physically and mentally. Likewise, taking them individually, their\r\nappearance and bearing tended largely to strengthen the idea that the\r\nspirit of freedom was rapidly gaining ground in the minds of the slaves,\r\ndespite the efforts of the slave-holders to keep them in darkness. In\r\ncompany with the three men, for whom the above large reward was offered,\r\ncame a woman by the name of Eliza Nokey.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the opportunity presented itself, the Active Committee\r\nfeeling an unusual desire to hear their story, began the investigation\r\nby inquiring as to the cause of their escape, etc., which brought simple\r\nand homely but earnest answers from each. These answers afforded the\r\nbest possible means of seeing Slavery in its natural, practical\r\nworkings--of obtaining such testimony and representations of the vile\r\nsystem, as the most eloquent orator or able pen might labor in vain to\r\nmake clear and convincing, although this arrival had obviously been\r\nowned by men of high standing. The fugitives themselves innocently\r\nstated that one of the masters, who was in the habit of flogging adult\r\nfemales, was a \"moderate man.\" Josiah Bailey was the leader of this\r\nparty, and he appeared well-qualified for this position. He was about\r\ntwenty-nine years of age, and in no particular physically, did he seem\r\nto be deficient. He was likewise civil and polite in his manners, and a\r\nman of good common sense. He was held and oppressed by William H.\r\nHughlett, a farmer and dealer in ship timber, who had besides invested\r\nin slaves to the number of forty head. In his habits he was generally\r\ntaken for a \"moderate\" and \"fair\" man, \"though he was in the habit of\r\nflogging the slaves--females as well as males,\" after they had arrived\r\nat the age of maturity. This was not considered strange or cruel in\r\nMaryland. Josiah was the \"foreman\" on the place, and was entrusted with\r\nthe management of hauling the ship-timber, and through harvesting and\r\nbusy seasons was required to lead in the fields. He was regarded as one\r\nof the most valuable hands in that part of the country, being valued at\r\n$2,000. Three weeks before he escaped, Joe was \"stripped naked,\" and\r\n\"flogged\" very cruelly by his master, simply because he had a dispute\r\nwith one of the fellow-servants, who had stolen, as Joe alleged, seven\r\ndollars of his hard earnings. This flogging, produced in Joe's mind, an\r\nunswerving determination to leave Slavery or die: to try his luck on the\r\nUnderground Rail Road at all hazards. The very name of Slavery, made the\r\nfire fairly burn in his bones. Although a married man, having a wife and\r\nthree children (owned by Hughlett), he was not prepared to let his\r\naffection for them keep him in chains--so Anna Maria, his wife, and his\r\nchildren Ellen, Anna Maria, and Isabella, were shortly widowed and\r\norphaned by the slave lash.\r\n\r\nWilliam Bailey was owned by John C. Henry, a large slave-holder, and a\r\nvery \"hard\" one, if what William alleged of him was true. His story\r\ncertainly had every appearance of truthfulness. A recent brutal flogging\r\nhad \"stiffened his back-bone,\" and furnished him with his excuse for not\r\nbeing willing to continue in Maryland, working his strength away to\r\nenrich his master, or the man who claimed to be such. The memorable\r\nflogging, however, which caused him to seek flight on the Underground\r\nRail Road, was not administered by his master or on his master's\r\nplantation. He was hired out, and it was in this situation that he was\r\nso barbarously treated. Yet he considered his master more in fault than\r\nthe man to whom he was hired, but redress there was none, save to\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nThe hour for forwarding the party by the Committee, came too soon to\r\nallow time for the writing of any account of Peter Pennington and Eliza\r\nNokey. Suffice it to say, that in struggling through their journey,\r\ntheir spirits never flagged; they had determined not to stop short of\r\nCanada. They truly had a very high appreciation of freedom, but a very\r\npoor opinion of Maryland.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLAVE TRADER HALL IS FOILED.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT McCOY _alias_ WILLIAM DONAR.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1854, the Committee received per steamer, directly from\r\nNorfolk, Va., Robert McCoy and Elizabeth Saunders. Robert had constantly\r\nbeen in the clutches of the negro-trader Hall, for the last sixteen\r\nyears, previous to his leaving, being owned by him. He had, therefore,\r\npossessed very favorable opportunities for varied observation and\r\nexperience relative to the trader's conduct in his nefarious business,\r\nas well as for witnessing the effects of the auction-block upon all\r\nages--rending asunder the dearest ties, despite the piteous wails of\r\nchildhood or womanhood, parental or conjugal relations. But no attempt\r\nwill be made to chronicle the deeds of this dealer in human flesh. Those\r\nstories fresh from the lips of one who had just escaped, were painful in\r\nthe extreme, but in the very nature of things some of the statements are\r\ntoo revolting to be published. In lieu of this fact, except the above\r\nallusions to the trader's business, this sketch will only refer to\r\nRobert's condition as a slave, and finally as a traveler on the\r\nUnderground Rail Road.\r\n\r\nRobert was a man of medium size, dark mulatto, of more than ordinary\r\nintelligence. His duties had been confined to the house, and not to the\r\nslave pen. As a general thing, he had managed, doubtless through much\r\nshrewdness, to avoid very severe outrages from the trader. On the whole,\r\nhe had fared \"about as well\" as the generality of slaves.\r\n\r\nYet, in order to free himself from his \"miserable\" life, he was willing,\r\nas he declared, to suffer almost any sacrifice. Indeed, his conduct\r\nproved the sincerity of this declaration, as he had actually been\r\nconcealed five months in a place in the city, where he could not\r\npossibly avoid daily suffering of the most trying kind. His resolve to\r\nbe free was all this while maturing. The trader had threatened to sell\r\nRobert, and to prevent it Robert (thus) \"took out.\" Successfully did he\r\nelude the keen scent and grasp of the hunters, who made diligent efforts\r\nto recapture him. Although a young man--only about twenty-eight years of\r\nage, his health was by no means good. His system had evidently been\r\nconsiderably shattered by Slavery, and symptoms of consumption, together\r\nwith chronic rheumatism, were making rapid headway against the physical\r\nman. Under his various ills, he declared, as did many others from the\r\nland of bondage, that his faith in God afforded him comfort and hope. He\r\nwas obliged to leave his wife, Eliza, in bonds, not knowing whether they\r\nshould ever meet again on earth, but he was somewhat hopeful that the\r\nway would open for her escape also.\r\n\r\nAfter reaching Philadelphia, where his arrival had long been anticipated\r\nby the Vigilance Committee, his immediate wants were met, and in due\r\norder he was forwarded to New Bedford, where, he was led to feel, he\r\nwould be happy in freedom.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he been in New Bedford one month, before his prayers and\r\nhopes were realized with regard to the deliverance of his wife. On\r\nhearing of the good news of her coming he wrote as follows--\r\n\r\n\r\n    NEW BEDFORD, Nov. 3, 1859.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:--i embrace this opertunity to inform you that i\r\n    received your letter with pleasure, i am enjoying good health\r\n    and hope that these few lines will find you enjoying the same\r\n    blessing. i rejoise to hear from you i feel very much indetted\r\n    to you for not writing before but i have been so bissy that is\r\n    the cause, i rejoise to heare of the arrival of my wife, and\r\n    hope she is not sick from the roling of the sea and if she is\r\n    not, pleas to send her on here Monday with a six baral warlian\r\n    and a rifall to gard her up to my residance i thank you kindly\r\n    for the good that you have don for me. Give my respects to Mrs.\r\n    Still, tell her i want to see her very bad and you also i would\r\n    come but i am afraid yet to venture, i received your letter the\r\n    second, but about the first of spring i hope to pay you a visit\r\n    or next summer. i am getting something to do every day. i will\r\n    write on her arrivall and tell you more. Mr. R. White sends his\r\n    love to you and your famerly and says that he is very much\r\n    indetted to you for his not writing and all so he desires to\r\n    know wheather his cloths has arived yet or not, and if they are\r\n    please to express them on to him or if at preasant by Mrs.\r\n    Donar. Not any more at preasent. i remain your affectionate\r\n    brother,\r\n\r\n    WILLIAM DONAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the same arrival, and similarly secreted, Elizabeth Frances, alias\r\nEllen Saunders, had the good luck to reach Philadelphia. She was a\r\nsingle young woman, about twenty-two, with as pleasant a countenance as\r\none would wish to see. Her manners were equally agreeable. Perhaps her\r\njoy over her achieved victory added somewhat to her personal appearance.\r\nShe had, however, belonged to the more favored class of slaves. She had\r\nneither been over-worked nor badly abused. Elizabeth was the property of\r\na lady a few shades lighter than herself, (Elizabeth was a mulatto) by\r\nthe name of Sarah Shephard, of Norfolk. In order the more effectually to\r\nprofit by Elizabeth's labor, the mistress resorted to the plan of hiring\r\nher out for a given sum per month. Against this usage Elizabeth urged no\r\ncomplaint. Indeed the only very serious charge she brought was to the\r\neffect, that her mistress sold her mother away from her far South, when\r\nshe was a child only ten years old. She had also sold a brother and\r\nsister to a foreign southern market. The reflections consequent upon the\r\ncourse that her mistress had thus pursued, awakened Elizabeth to much\r\nstudy relative to freedom, and by the time that she had reached\r\nwomanhood she had very decided convictions touching her duty with regard\r\nto escaping. Thus growing to hate slavery in every way and manner, she\r\nwas prepared to make a desperate effort to be free. Having saved\r\nthirty-five dollars by rigid economy, she was willing to give every cent\r\nof it (although it was all she possessed), to be aided from Norfolk to\r\nPhiladelphia. After reaching the city, having suffered severely while\r\ncoming, she was invited to remain until somewhat recruited. In the\r\nhealthy air of freedom she was soon fully restored, and ready to take\r\nher departure for New Bedford, which place she reached without\r\ndifficulty and was cordially welcomed. The following letter, expressive\r\nof her obligations for aid received, was forwarded soon after her\r\narrival in New Bedford:\r\n\r\n\r\n    NEW BEDFORD, Mass., October 16th, 1854.\r\n\r\n    MR. STILL:--Dear Sir--I now take my pen in my hand to inform you\r\n    of my health which is good at present all except a cold I have\r\n    got but I hope when these few lines reach you you may be\r\n    enjoying good health. I arrived in New Bedford Thursday morning\r\n    safely and what little I have seen of the city I like it very\r\n    much my friends were very glad to see me. I found my sister very\r\n    well. Give my love to Mrs. Still and also your dear little\r\n    children. I am now out at service. I do not think of going to\r\n    Canada now. I think I shall remain in this city this winter.\r\n    Please tell Mrs. Still I have not met any person who has treated\r\n    me any kinder than she did since I left. I consider you both to\r\n    have been true friends to me. I hope you will think me the same\r\n    to you. I feel very thankful to you indeed. It might been\r\n    supposed, out of sight out of mind, but it is not so. I never\r\n    forget my friends. Give my love to Florence. If you come to this\r\n    city I would be very happy to see you. Kiss your dear little\r\n    children for me. Please to answer this as soon as possible, so\r\n    that I may know you received this. No more at present. I still\r\n    remain your friend,\r\n\r\n    ELLEN SAUNDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIZA MCCOY--the wife of Robert McCoy, whose narrative has just been\r\ngiven--and who was left to wait in hope when her husband escaped--soon\r\nfollowed him to freedom. It is a source of great satisfaction to be able\r\nto present her narrative in so close proximity to her husband's. He\r\narrived about the first of October--she about the first of November,\r\nfollowing. From her lips testimony of much weight and interest was\r\nlistened to by several friends relative to her sufferings as a slave--on\r\nthe auction-block, and in a place of concealment seven months, waiting\r\nand praying for an opportunity to escape. But it was thought sufficient\r\nto record merely a very brief outline of her active slave life, which\r\nconsisted of the following noticeable features.\r\n\r\nEliza had been owned by Andrew Sigany, of Norfolk--age about\r\nthirty-eight--mulatto, and a woman whose appearance would readily\r\ncommand attention and respect anywhere outside of the barbarism of\r\nSlavery. She stated that her experience as a sufferer in cruel hands had\r\nbeen very trying, and that in fretting under hardships, she had \"always\r\nwanted to be free.\" Her language was unmistakable on this point. Neither\r\nmistress nor servant was satisfied with each other; the mistress was so\r\n\"queer\" and \"hard to please,\" that Eliza became heartily sick of trying\r\nto please her--an angel would have failed with such a woman. So, while\r\nmatters were getting no better, but, on the contrary, were growing worse\r\nand worse, Eliza thought she would seek a more pleasant atmosphere in\r\nthe North. In fact she felt that it would afford her no little relief to\r\nallow her place to be occupied by another. When she went into close\r\nquarters of concealment, she fully understood what was meant and all the\r\nliabilities thereto. She had pluck enough to endure unto the end without\r\nmurmuring. The martyrs in olden times who dwelt in \"dens and caves of\r\nthe earth,\" could hardly have fared worse than some of these way-worn\r\ntravelers.\r\n\r\nAfter the rest, needed by one who had suffered so severely until her\r\narrival in Philadelphia, she was forwarded to her anxiously waiting\r\nhusband in New Bedford, where she was gladly received.\r\n\r\nFrom the frequent arrivals from Virginia, especially in steamers, it may\r\nbe thought that no very stringent laws or regulations existed by which\r\noffenders, who might aid the Underground Rail Road, could be severely\r\npunished--that the slave-holders were lenient, indifferent and unguarded\r\nas to how this property took wings and escaped. In order to enlighten\r\nthe reader with regard to this subject, it seems necessary, in this\r\nconnection, to publish at least one of the many statutes from the slave\r\nlaws of the South bearing directly on the aid and escape of slaves by\r\nvessels. The following enactment is given as passed by the Legislature\r\nof Virginia in 1856:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE PROTECTION OF SLAVE PROPERTY IN VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A BILL PROVIDING ADDITIONAL PROTECTION FOR THE SLAVE PROPERTY OF\r\n    CITIZENS OF THIS COMMONWEALTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n    (1.) Be it enacted, by the General Assembly, that it shall not\r\n    be lawful for any vessel, of any size or description, whatever,\r\n    owned in whole, or in part, by any citizen or resident of\r\n    another State, and about to sail or steam for any port or place\r\n    in this State, for any port or place north of and beyond the\r\n    capes of Virginia, to depart from the waters of this\r\n    commonwealth, until said vessel has undergone the inspection\r\n    hereinafter provided for in this act, and received a certificate\r\n    to that effect. If any such vessel shall depart from the State\r\n    without such certificate of inspection, the captain or owner\r\n    thereof, shall forfeit and pay the sum of five hundred dollars,\r\n    to be recovered by any person who will sue for the same, in any\r\n    court of record in this State, in the name of the Governor of\r\n    the Commonwealth. Pending said suit, the vessel of said captain\r\n    or owner shall not leave the State until bond be given by the\r\n    captain or owner, or other person for him, payable to the\r\n    Governor, with two or three sureties satisfactory to the court,\r\n    in the penalty of one thousand dollars, for the payment of the\r\n    forfeit or fine, together with the cost and expenses incurred in\r\n    enforcing the same; and in default of such bond, the vessel\r\n    shall be held liable. Provided that nothing contained in this\r\n    section, shall apply to vessels belonging to the United States\r\n    Government, or vessels, American or foreign, bound direct to any\r\n    foreign country other than the British American Provinces.\r\n\r\n    (2.) The pilots licensed under the laws of Virginia, and while\r\n    attached to a vessel regularly employed as a pilot boat, are\r\n    hereby constituted inspectors to execute this act, so far as the\r\n    same may be applicable to the Chesapeake Bay, and the waters\r\n    tributary thereto, within the jurisdiction of this State,\r\n    together with such other inspectors as may be appointed by\r\n    virtue of this act.\r\n\r\n    (3.) The branch or license issued to a pilot according to the\r\n    provisions of the 92d chapter of Code, shall be sufficient\r\n    evidence that he is authorized and empowered to act as inspector\r\n    as aforesaid.\r\n\r\n    (4.) It shall be the duty of the inspector, or other person\r\n    authorized to act under this law, to examine and search all\r\n    vessels hereinbefore described, to see that no slave or person\r\n    held to service or labor in this State, or person charged with\r\n    the commission of any crime within the State, shall be concealed\r\n    on board said vessel. Such inspection shall be made within\r\n    twelve hours of the time of departure of such vessel from the\r\n    waters of Virginia, and may be made in any bay, river, creek, or\r\n    other water-course of the State, provided, however, that\r\n    steamers plying as regular packets, between ports in Virginia\r\n    and those north of, and outside of the capes of Virginia, shall\r\n    be inspected at the port of departure nearest Old Point Comfort.\r\n\r\n    (5.) A vessel so inspected and getting under way, with intent to\r\n    leave the waters of the State, if she returns to an anchorage\r\n    above Back River Point, or within Old Point Comfort, shall be\r\n    again inspected and charged as if an original case. If such\r\n    vessel be driven back by stress of weather to seek a harbor, she\r\n    shall be exempt from payment of a second fee, unless she holds\r\n    intercourse with the shore.\r\n\r\n    (6.) If, after searching the vessel, the inspector see no just\r\n    cause to detain her, he shall give to the captain a certificate\r\n    to that effect. If, however, upon such inspection, or in any\r\n    other manner, any slave or person held to service or labor, or\r\n    any person charged with any crime, be found on board of any\r\n    vessel whatever, for the purpose aforesaid, or said vessel be\r\n    detected in the act of leaving this commonwealth with any such\r\n    slave or person on board, or otherwise violating the provisions\r\n    of this act, he shall attach said vessel, and arrest all persons\r\n    on board, to be delivered up to the sergeant or sheriff of the\r\n    nearest port in this commonwealth, to be dealt with according to\r\n    law.\r\n\r\n    (7.) If any inspector or other officer be opposed, or shall have\r\n    reason to suspect that he will be opposed or obstructed in the\r\n    discharge of any duty required of him under this act, he shall\r\n    have power to summon and command the force of any county or\r\n    corporation to aid him in the discharge of such duty, and every\r\n    person who shall resist, obstruct, or refuse to aid any\r\n    inspector or other officer in the discharge of such duty, shall\r\n    be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction thereof,\r\n    shall be fined and imprisoned as in other cases of misdemeanor.\r\n\r\n    (8.) For every inspection of a vessel under this law, the\r\n    inspector, or other officer shall be entitled to demand and\r\n    receive the sum of five dollars; for the payment of which such\r\n    vessel shall be liable, and the inspector or other officer may\r\n    seize and hold her until the same is paid, together with all\r\n    charges incurred in taking care of the vessel, as well as in\r\n    enforcing the payment of the same. Provided, that steam packets\r\n    trading regularly between the waters of Virginia and ports north\r\n    of and beyond the capes of Virginia, shall pay not more than\r\n    five dollars for each inspection under the provisions of this\r\n    act; provided, however, that for every inspection of a vessel\r\n    engaged in the coal trade, the inspector shall not receive a\r\n    greater sum than two dollars.\r\n\r\n    (9.) Any inspector or other person apprehending a slave in the\r\n    act of escaping from the state, on board a vessel trading to or\r\n    belonging to a non-slave-holding state, or who shall give\r\n    information that will lead to the recovery of any slave, as\r\n    aforesaid, shall be entitled to a reward of One Hundred Dollars,\r\n    to be paid by the owner of such slave, or by the fiduciary\r\n    having charge of the estate to which such slave belongs; and if\r\n    the vessel be forfeited under the provisions of this act, he\r\n    shall be entitled to one-half of the proceeds arising from the\r\n    sale of the vessel; and if the same amounts to one hundred\r\n    dollars, he shall not receive from the owner the above reward of\r\n    one hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n    (10.) An inspector permitting a slave to escape for the want of\r\n    proper exertion, or by neglect in the discharge of his duty,\r\n    shall be fined One Hundred Dollars; or if for like causes he\r\n    permit a vessel, which the law requires him to inspect, to leave\r\n    the state without inspection, he shall be fined not less than\r\n    twenty, nor more than fifty dollars, to be recovered by warrant\r\n    by any person who will proceed against him.\r\n\r\n    (11.) No pilot acting under the authority of the laws of the\r\n    state, shall pilot out of the jurisdiction of this state any\r\n    such vessel as is described in this act, which has not obtained\r\n    and exhibited to him the certificate of inspection hereby\r\n    required; and if any pilot shall so offend, he shall forfeit and\r\n    pay not less than twenty, or more than fifty dollars, to be\r\n    recovered in the mode prescribed in the next preceding section\r\n    of this act.\r\n\r\n    (12.) The courts of the several counties or corporations\r\n    situated on the Chesapeake Bay, or its tributaries, by an order\r\n    entered on record, may appoint one or more inspectors, at such\r\n    place or places within their respective districts as they may\r\n    deem necessary, to prevent the escape or for the recapture of\r\n    slaves attempting to escape beyond the limits of the state, and\r\n    to search or otherwise examine all vessels trading to such\r\n    counties or corporations. The expenses in such cases to be\r\n    provided for by a levy on negroes now taxed by law; but no\r\n    inspection by county or corporation officers thus appointed,\r\n    shall supersede the inspection of such vessels by pilots and\r\n    other inspectors, as specially provided for in this act.\r\n\r\n    (13.) It shall be lawful for the county court of any county,\r\n    upon the application of five or more slave-holders, residents of\r\n    the counties where the application is made, by an order of\r\n    record, to designate one or more police stations in their\r\n    respective counties, and a captain and three or more other\r\n    persons as a police patrol on each station, for the recapture of\r\n    fugitive slaves; which patrol shall be in service at such times,\r\n    and such stations as the court shall direct by their order\r\n    aforesaid; and the said court shall allow a reasonable\r\n    compensation, to be paid to the members of such patrol; and for\r\n    that purpose, the said court may from time to time direct a levy\r\n    on negroes now taxed by law, at such rate per capita as the\r\n    court may think sufficient, to be collected and accounted for by\r\n    the sheriff as other county levies, and to be called, \"The\r\n    fugitive slave tax.\" The owner of each fugitive slave in the act\r\n    of escaping beyond the limits of the commonwealth, to a\r\n    non-slave-holding state, and captured by the patrol aforesaid,\r\n    shall pay for each slave over fifteen, and under forty-five\r\n    years old, a reward of One Hundred dollars; for each slave over\r\n    five, and under fifteen years old, the sum of sixty dollars; and\r\n    for all others, the sum of forty dollars. Which reward shall be\r\n    divided equally among the members of the patrol retaking the\r\n    slave and actually on duty at the time; and to secure the\r\n    payment of said reward, the said patrol may retain possession\r\n    and use of the slave until the reward is paid or secured to\r\n    them.\r\n\r\n    (14.) The executive of this State may appoint one or more\r\n    inspectors for the Rappahannock and Potomac rivers, if he shall\r\n    deem it expedient, for the due execution of this act. The\r\n    inspectors so appointed to perform the same duties, and to be\r\n    invested with the same powers in their respective districts, and\r\n    receive the same fees, as pilots acting as inspectors in other\r\n    parts of the State. A vessel subject to inspection under this\r\n    law, departing from any of the above-named counties or rivers on\r\n    her voyage to sea, shall be exempted from the payment of a fee\r\n    for a second inspection by another officer, if provided with a\r\n    certificate from the proper inspecting officer of that district;\r\n    but if, after proceeding on her voyage, she returns to the port\r\n    or place of departure, or enters any other port, river, or\r\n    roadstead in the State, the said vessel shall be again\r\n    inspected, and pay a fee of five dollars, as if she had\r\n    undergone no previous examination and received no previous\r\n    certificate.\r\n\r\n    If driven by stress of weather to seek a harbor, and she has no\r\n    intercourse with the shore, then, and in that case, no second\r\n    fee shall be paid by said vessel.\r\n\r\n    (15.) For the better execution of the provisions of this act, in\r\n    regard to the inspection, of vessels, the executive is hereby\r\n    authorized and directed to appoint a chief inspector, to reside\r\n    at Norfolk, whose duty it shall be, to direct and superintend\r\n    the police, agents, or inspectors above referred to. He shall\r\n    keep a record of all vessels engaged in the piloting business,\r\n    together with a list of such persons as may be employed as\r\n    pilots and inspectors under this law. The owner or owners of\r\n    each boat shall make a monthly report to him, of all vessels\r\n    inspected by persons attached to said pilot boats, the names of\r\n    such vessels, the owner or owners thereof, and the places where\r\n    owned or licensed, and where trading to or from, and the\r\n    business in which they are engaged, together with a list of\r\n    their crews. Any inspector failing to make his report to the\r\n    chief inspector, shall pay a fine of twenty dollars for each\r\n    such failure, which fine shall be recovered by warrant, before a\r\n    justice of the county or corporation. The chief inspector may\r\n    direct the time and station for the cruise of each pilot boat,\r\n    and perform such other duty as the Governor may designate, not\r\n    inconsistent with the other provisions of this act. He shall\r\n    make a quarterly return to the executive of all the transactions\r\n    of his department, reporting to him any failure or refusal on\r\n    the part of inspectors to discharge the duty assigned to them,\r\n    and the Governor, for sufficient cause, may suspend or remove\r\n    from office any delinquent inspector. The chief inspector shall\r\n    receive as his compensation, ten per cent, on all the fees and\r\n    fines received by the inspectors acting under his authority, and\r\n    may be removed at the pleasure of the executive.\r\n\r\n    (16.) All fees and forfeitures imposed by this act, and not\r\n    otherwise specially provided for, shall go one half to the\r\n    informer, and the other be paid into the treasury of the State,\r\n    to constitute a fund, to be called the \"fugitive slave fund,\"\r\n    and to be used for the payment of rewards awarded by the\r\n    Governor, for the apprehension of runaway slaves, and to pay\r\n    other expenses incident to the execution of this law, together\r\n    with such other purposes as may hereafter be determined on by\r\n    the General Assembly.\r\n\r\n    (17.) This act shall be in force from its passage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESCAPING IN A CHEST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    $150 REWARD. Ran away from the subscriber, on Sunday night, 27th\r\n    inst., my NEGRO GIRL, Lear Green, about 18 years of age, black\r\n    complexion, round-featured, good-looking and ordinary size; she\r\n    had on and with her when she left, a tan-colored silk bonnet, a\r\n    dark plaid silk dress, a light mouslin delaine, also one watered\r\n    silk cape and one tan colored cape. I have reason to be\r\n    confident that she was persuaded off by a negro man named Wm.\r\n    Adams, black, quick spoken, 5 feet 10 inches high, a large scar\r\n    on one side of his face, running down in a ridge by the corner\r\n    of his mouth, about 4 inches long, barber by trade, but works\r\n    mostly about taverns, opening oysters, &c. He has been missing\r\n    about a week; he had been heard to say he was going to marry the\r\n    above girl and ship to New York, where it is said his mother\r\n    resides. The above reward will be paid if said girl is taken out\r\n    of the State of Maryland and delivered to me; or fifty dollars\r\n    if taken in the State of Maryland.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    JAMES NOBLE,\r\n\r\n    m26-3t.\r\n\r\n    No. 153 Broadway, Baltimore.\r\n\r\n\r\nLear Green, so particularly advertised in the \"Baltimore Sun\" by \"James\r\nNoble,\" won for herself a strong claim to a high place among the heroic\r\nwomen of the nineteenth century. In regard to description and age the\r\nadvertisement is tolerably accurate, although her master might have\r\nadded, that her countenance was one of peculiar modesty and grace.\r\nInstead of being \"black,\" she was of a \"dark-brown color.\" Of her\r\nbondage she made the following statement: She was owned by \"James Noble,\r\na Butter Dealer\" of Baltimore. He fell heir to Lear by the will of his\r\nwife's mother, Mrs. Rachel Howard, by whom she had previously been\r\nowned. Lear was but a mere child when she came into the hands of Noble's\r\nfamily. She, therefore, remembered but little of her old mistress. Her\r\nyoung mistress, however, had made a lasting impression upon her mind;\r\nfor she was very exacting and oppressive in regard to the tasks she was\r\ndaily in the habit of laying upon Lear's shoulders, with no disposition\r\nwhatever to allow her any liberties. At least Lear was never indulged in\r\nthis respect. In this situation a young man by the name of William Adams\r\nproposed marriage to her. This offer she was inclined to accept, but\r\ndisliked the idea of being encumbered with the chains of slavery and the\r\nduties of a family at the same time.\r\n\r\nAfter a full consultation with her mother and also her intended upon the\r\nmatter, she decided that she must be free in order to fill the station\r\nof a wife and mother. For a time dangers and difficulties in the way of\r\nescape seemed utterly to set at defiance all hope of success. Whilst\r\nevery pulse was beating strong for liberty, only one chance seemed to be\r\nleft, the trial of which required as much courage as it would to endure\r\nthe cutting off the right arm or plucking out the right eye. An old\r\nchest of substantial make, such as sailors commonly use, was procured. A\r\nquilt, a pillow, and a few articles of raiment, with a small quantity of\r\nfood and a bottle of water were put in it, and Lear placed therein;\r\nstrong ropes were fastened around the chest and she was safely stowed\r\namongst the ordinary freight on one of the Erricson line of steamers.\r\nHer intended's mother, who was a free woman, agreed to come as a\r\npassenger on the same boat. How could she refuse? The prescribed rules\r\nof the Company assigned colored passengers to the deck. In this instance\r\nit was exactly where this guardian and mother desired to be--as near the\r\nchest as possible. Once or twice, during the silent watches of the\r\nnight, she was drawn irresistibly to the chest, and could not refrain\r\nfrom venturing to untie the rope and raise the lid a little, to see if\r\nthe poor child still lived, and at the same time to give her a breath of\r\nfresh air. Without uttering a whisper, that frightful moment, this\r\noffice was successfully performed. That the silent prayers of this\r\noppressed young woman, together with her faithful protector's, were\r\nmomentarily ascending to the ear of the good God above, there can be no\r\nquestion. Nor is it to be doubted for a moment but that some ministering\r\nangel aided the mother to unfasten the rope, and at the same time nerved\r\nthe heart of poor Lear to endure the trying ordeal of her perilous\r\nsituation. She declared that she had no fear.\r\n\r\nAfter she had passed eighteen hours in the chest, the steamer arrived at\r\nthe wharf in Philadelphia, and in due time the living freight was\r\nbrought off the boat, and at first was delivered at a house in Barley\r\nstreet, occupied by particular friends of the mother. Subsequently chest\r\nand freight were removed to the residence of the writer, in whose family\r\nshe remained several days under the protection and care of the Vigilance\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nSuch hungering and thirsting for liberty, as was evinced by Lear Green,\r\nmade the efforts of the most ardent friends, who were in the habit of\r\naiding fugitives, seem feeble in the extreme. Of all the heroes in\r\nCanada, or out of it, who have purchased their liberty by downright\r\nbravery, through perils the most hazardous, none deserve more praise\r\nthan Lear Green.\r\n\r\nShe remained for a time in this family, and was then forwarded to\r\nElmira. In this place she was married to William Adams, who has been\r\npreviously alluded to. They never went to Canada, but took up their\r\npermanent abode in Elmira. The brief space of about three years only was\r\nallotted her in which to enjoy freedom, as death came and terminated her\r\ncareer. About the time of this sad occurrence, her mother-in-law died in\r\nthis city. The impressions made by both mother and daughter can never be\r\neffaced. The chest in which Lear escaped has been preserved by the\r\nwriter as a rare trophy, and her photograph taken, while in the chest,\r\nis an excellent likeness of her and, at the same time, a fitting\r\nmemorial.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISAAC WILLIAMS, HENRY BANKS, AND KIT NICKLESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTHS IN A CAVE,--SHOT BY SLAVE-HUNTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nRarely were three travelers from the house of bondage received at the\r\nPhiladelphia station whose narratives were more interesting than those\r\nof the above-named individuals. Before escaping they had encountered\r\ndifficulties of the most trying nature. No better material for dramatic\r\neffect could be found than might have been gathered from the incidents\r\nof their lives and travels. But all that we can venture to introduce\r\nhere is the brief account recorded at the time of their sojourn at the\r\nPhiladelphia station when on their way to Canada in 1854. The three\r\njourneyed together. They had been slaves together in the same\r\nneighborhood. Two of them had shared the same den and cave in the woods,\r\nand had been shot, captured, and confined in the same prison; had broken\r\nout of prison and again escaped; consequently their hearts were\r\nthoroughly cemented in the hope of reaching freedom together.\r\n\r\nIsaac was a stout-made young man, about twenty-six years of age,\r\npossessing a good degree of physical and mental ability. Indeed his\r\nintelligence forbade his submission to the requirements of Slavery,\r\nrendered him unhappy and led him to seek his freedom. He owed services\r\nto D. Fitchhugh up to within a short time before he escaped. Against\r\nFitchhugh he made grave charges, said that he was a \"hard, bad man.\" It\r\nis but fair to add that Isaac was similarly regarded by his master, so\r\nboth were dissatisfied with each other. But the master had the advantage\r\nof Isaac, he could sell him. Isaac, however, could turn the table on his\r\nmaster, by running off. But the master moved quickly and sold Isaac to\r\nDr. James, a negro trader. The trader designed making a good speculation\r\nout of his investment: Isaac determined that he should be disappointed;\r\nindeed that he should lose every dollar that he paid for him. So while\r\nthe doctor was planning where and how he could get the best price for\r\nhim, Isaac was planning how and where he might safely get beyond his\r\nreach. The time for planning and acting with Isaac was, however,\r\nexceedingly short. He was daily expecting to be called upon to take his\r\ndeparture for the South. In this situation he made known his condition\r\nto a friend of his who was in a precisely similar situation; had lately\r\nbeen sold just as Isaac had to the same trader James. So no argument was\r\nneeded to convince his friend and fellow-servant that if they meant to\r\nbe free they would have to set off immediately.\r\n\r\nThat night Henry Banks and Isaac Williams started for the woods\r\ntogether, preferring to live among reptiles and wild animals, rather\r\nthan be any longer at the disposal of Dr. James. For two weeks they\r\nsuccessfully escaped their pursuers. The woods, however, were being\r\nhunted in every direction, and one day the pursuers came upon them, shot\r\nthem both, and carried them to King George's Co. jail. The jail being an\r\nold building had weak places in it; but the prisoners concluded to make\r\nno attempt to break out while suffering badly from their wounds. So they\r\nremained one month in confinement. All the while their brave spirits\r\nunder suffering grew more and more daring. Again they decided to strike\r\nfor freedom, but where to go, save to the woods, they had not the\r\nslightest idea. Of course they had heard, as most slaves had, of cave\r\nlife, and pretty well understood all the measures which had to be\r\nresorted to for security when entering upon so hazardous an undertaking.\r\nThey concluded, however, that they could not make their condition any\r\nworse, let circumstances be what they might in this respect. Having\r\ndiscovered how they could break jail, they were not long in\r\naccomplishing their purpose, and were out and off to the woods again.\r\nThis time they went far into the forest, and there they dug a cave, and\r\nwith great pains had every thing so completely arranged as to conceal\r\nthe spot entirely. In this den they stayed three months. Now and then\r\nthey would manage to secure a pig. A friend also would occasionally\r\nserve them with a meal. Their sufferings at best were fearful; but great\r\nas they were, the thought of returning to Slavery never occurred to\r\nthem, and the longer they stayed in the woods, the greater was their\r\ndetermination to be free. In the belief that their owner had about given\r\nthem up they resolved to take the North Star for a pilot, and try in\r\nthis way to reach free land.\r\n\r\nKit, an old friend in time of need, having proved true to them in their\r\ncave, was consulted. He fully appreciated their heroism, and determined\r\nthat he would join them in the undertaking, as he was badly treated by\r\nhis master, who was called General Washington, a common farmer, hard\r\ndrinker, and brutal fighter, which Kit's poor back fully evinced by the\r\nmarks it bore. Of course Isaac and Henry were only too willing to have\r\nhim accompany them.\r\n\r\nIn leaving their respective homes they broke kindred ties of the\r\ntenderest nature. Isaac had a wife, Eliza, and three children, Isaac,\r\nEstella, and Ellen, all owned by Fitchhugh. Henry was only nineteen,\r\nsingle, but left parents, brothers, and sisters, all owned by different\r\nslave-holders. Kit had a wife, Matilda, and three children, Sarah Ann,\r\nJane Frances, and Ellen, slaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 28, 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL OF FIVE FROM THE EASTERN SHORE OF MARYLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nCYRUS MITCHELL, _alias_ JOHN STEEL; JOSHUA HANDY, _alias_ HAMBLETON\r\nHAMBY; CHARLES DULTON, _alias_ WILLIAM ROBINSON; EPHRAIM HUDSON, _alias_\r\nJOHN SPRY; FRANCIS MOLOCK, _alias_ THOMAS JACKSON; all in \"good order\"\r\nand full of hope.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from the fearless friend of the slave, Thomas\r\nGarrett, is a specimen of his manner of dispatching Underground Rail\r\nRoad business. He used Uncle Sam's mail, and his own name, with as much\r\nfreedom as though he had been President of the Pennsylvania Central Rail\r\nRoad, instead of only a conductor and stock-holder on the Underground\r\nRail Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n    9 mo. 26th, 1856.\r\n\r\n    RESPECTED FRIEND:--WILLIAM STILL, I send on to thy care this\r\n    evening by Rail Road, 5 able-bodied men, on their way North;\r\n    receive them as the Good Samaritan of old and oblige thy friend,\r\n    THOMAS GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"able-bodied men\" duly arrived, and were thus recorded on the\r\nUnderground Rail Road books as trophies of the success of the friends of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCyrus is twenty-six years of age, stout, and unmistakably dark, and was\r\nowned by James K. Lewis, a store-keeper, and a \"hard master.\" He kept\r\nslaves for the express purpose of hiring them out, and it seemed to\r\nafford him as much pleasure to receive the hard-earned dollars of his\r\nbondmen as if he had labored for them with his own hands. \"It mattered\r\nnot, how mean a man might be,\" if he would pay the largest price, he was\r\nthe man whom the store-keeper preferred to hire to. This always caused\r\nCyrus to dislike him. Latterly he had been talking of moving into the\r\nState of Virginia. Cyrus disliked this talk exceedingly, but he \"said\r\nnothing to the white people\" touching the matter. However, he was not\r\nlong in deciding that such a move would be of no advantage to him;\r\nindeed, he had an idea if all was true that he had heard about that\r\nplace, he would be still more miserable there, than he had ever been\r\nunder his present owner. At once, he decided that he would move towards\r\nCanada, and that he would be fixed in his new home before his master got\r\noff to Virginia, unless he moved sooner than Cyrus expected him to do.\r\nThose nearest of kin, to whom he felt most tenderly allied, and from\r\nwhom he felt that it would be hard to part, were his father and mother.\r\nHe, however, decided that he should have to leave them. Freedom, he\r\nfelt, was even worth the giving up of parents.\r\n\r\nBelieving that company was desirable, he took occasion to submit his\r\nplan to certain friends, who were at once pleased with the idea of a\r\ntrip on the Underground Rail Road, to Canada, etc; and all agreed to\r\njoin him. At first, they traveled on foot; of their subsequent travel,\r\nmention has already been made in friend Garrett's epistle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoshua is about twenty-seven years of age, quite stout, brown color, and\r\nwould pass for an intelligent farm hand. He was satisfied never to wear\r\nthe yoke again that some one else might reap the benefit of his toil.\r\nHis master, Isaac Harris, he denounced as a \"drunkard.\" His chief excuse\r\nfor escaping, was because Harris had \"sold\" his \"only brother.\" He was\r\nobliged to leave his father and mother in the hands of his master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles is twenty-two years of age, also stout, and well-made, and\r\napparently possessed all the qualifications for doing a good day's work\r\non a farm. He was held to service by Mrs. Mary Hurley. Charles gave no\r\nglowing account of happiness and comfort under the rule of the female\r\nsex, indeed, he was positive in saying that he had \"been used rough.\"\r\nDuring the present year, he was sold for $1200.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEphraim is twenty-two years of age, stout and athletic, one who appears\r\nin every way fitted for manual labor or anything else that he might be\r\nprivileged to learn. John Campbell Henry, was the name of the man whom\r\nhe had been taught to address as master, and for whose benefit he had\r\nbeen compelled to labor up to the day he \"took out.\" In considering what\r\nhe had been in Maryland and how he had been treated all his life, he\r\nalleged that John Campbell Henry was a \"bad man.\" Not only had Ephraim\r\nbeen treated badly by his master but he had been hired out to a man no\r\nbetter than his master, if as good. Ephraim left his mother and six\r\nbrothers and sisters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrancis is twenty-one, an able-bodied \"article,\" of dark color, and was\r\nowned by James A. Waddell. All that he could say of his owner, was, that\r\nhe was a \"hard master,\" from whom he was very glad to escape.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDRY ARRIVALS, ABOUT AUGUST 1ST, 1855.\r\n\r\n\r\nArrival 1st.

William Govan.\r\n\r\nWhile none in this catalogue belonged to the class whose daring\r\nadventures rendered their narratives marvellous, nevertheless they\r\nrepresented a very large number of those who were continually on the\r\nalert to get rid of their captivity. And in all their efforts in this\r\ndirection they manifested a marked willingness to encounter perils\r\neither by land or water, by day or by night, to obtain their God-given\r\nrights. Doubtless, even among these names, will be found those who have\r\nbeen supposed to be lost, and mysteries will be disclosed which have\r\npuzzled scores of relatives longing and looking many years in vain to\r\nascertain the whereabouts of this or that companion, brother, sister, or\r\nfriend. So, if impelled by no other consideration than the hope of\r\nconsoling this class of anxious inquirers, this is a sufficient\r\njustification for not omitting them entirely, notwithstanding the risk\r\nof seeming to render these pages monotonous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArrival No. 1. First on this record was a young mulatto woman,\r\ntwenty-nine years of age--orange color, who could read and write very\r\nwell, and was unusually intelligent and withal quite handsome. She was\r\nknown by the name of Frances Hilliard, and escaped from Richmond, Va.,\r\nwhere she was owned by Beverly Blair. The owner hired her out to a man\r\nby the name of Green, from whom he received seventy dollars per annum.\r\nGreen allowed her to hire herself for the same amount, with the\r\nunderstanding that Frances should find all her own clothes, board\r\nherself and find her own house to live in. Her husband, who was also a\r\nslave, had fled nearly one year previous, leaving her widowed, of\r\ncourse. Notwithstanding the above mentioned conditions, under which she\r\nhad the privilege of living, Frances said that she \"had been used well.\"\r\nShe had been sold four times in her life. In the first instance the\r\nfailure of her master was given as the reason of her sale. Subsequently\r\nshe was purchased and sold by different traders, who designed to\r\nspeculate upon her as a \"fancy article.\" They would dress her very\r\nelegantly, in order to show her off to the best advantage possible, but\r\nit appears that she had too much regard for her husband and her honor,\r\nto consent to fill the positions which had been basely assigned her by\r\nher owners.\r\n\r\nFrances assisted her husband to escape from his owner--Taits--and was\r\nnever contented until she succeeded in following him to Canada. In\r\nescaping, she left her mother, Sarah Corbin, and her sister, Maria. On\r\nreaching the Vigilance Committee she learned all about her husband. She\r\nwas conveyed from Richmond secreted on a steamer under the care of one\r\nof the colored hands on the boat. From here she was forwarded to Canada\r\nat the expense of the Committee. Arriving in Toronto, and not finding\r\nher hopes fully realized, with regard to meeting her husband, she wrote\r\nback the following letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n    TORONTO, CANADA, U.C., October 15th, 1855.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MR. STILL:--Sir--I take the opportunity of writing you a\r\n    few lines to inform you of my health. I am very well at present,\r\n    and hope that when these few lines reach you they may find you\r\n    enjoying the same blessing. Give my love to Mrs. Still and all\r\n    the children, and also to Mr. Swan, and tell him that he must\r\n    give you the money that he has, and you will please send it to\r\n    me, as I have received a letter from my husband saying that I\r\n    must come on to him as soon as I get the money from him. I\r\n    cannot go to him until I get the money that Mr. Swan has in\r\n    hand. Please tell Mr. Caustle that the clothes he spoke of my\r\n    mother did not know anything about them. I left them with Hinson\r\n    Brown and he promised to give them to Mr. Smith. Tell him to ask\r\n    Mr. Smith to get them from Mr. Brown for me, and when I get\r\n    settled I will send him word and he can send them to me. The\r\n    letters that were sent to me I received them all. I wish you\r\n    would send me word if Mr. Smith is on the boat yet--if he is\r\n    please write me word in your next letter. Please send me the\r\n    money as soon as you possibly can, for I am very anxious to see\r\n    my husband. I send to you for I think you will do what you can\r\n    for me. No more at present, but remain Yours truly,\r\n\r\n    FRANCES HILLIARD.\r\n\r\n    Send me word if Mr. Caustle had given Mr. Smith the money that\r\n    he promised to give him.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor one who had to steal the art of reading and writing, her letter\r\nbears studying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArrival No. 2. Louisa Harding, alias Rebecca Hall. Louisa was a mulatto\r\ngirl, seventeen years of age. She reported herself from Baltimore, where\r\nshe had been owned by lawyer Magill. It might be said that she also\r\npossessed great personal attractions as an \"article\" of much value in\r\nthe eye of a trader. All the near kin whom she named as having left\r\nbehind, consisted of a mother and a brother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArrival No. 3. John Mackintosh. John's history is short. He represented\r\nhimself as having arrived from Darien, Georgia, where he had seen \"hard\r\ntimes.\" Age, forty-four. This is all that was recorded of John, except\r\nthe expenses met by the Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArrival No. 4. Maria Jane Houston. The little State of Delaware lost in\r\nthe person of Maria, one of her nicest-looking bond-maids. She had just\r\narrived at the age of twenty-one, and felt that she had already been\r\nsufficiently wronged. She was a tall, dark, young woman, from the\r\nneighborhood of Cantwell's Bridge. Although she had no horrible tales of\r\nsuffering to relate, the Committee regarded her as well worthy of aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArrival No. 5. Miles Hooper. This subject came from North Carolina; he\r\nwas owned by George Montigue, who lived at Federal Mills, was a decided\r\nopponent to the no-pay system, to flogging, and selling likewise. In\r\nfact nothing that was auxiliary to Slavery was relished by him.\r\nConsequently he concluded to leave the place altogether. At the time\r\nthat Miles took this stand he was twenty-three years of age, a\r\ndark-complexioned man, rather under the medium height, physically, but a\r\nfull-grown man mentally. \"My owner was a hard man,\" said Miles, in\r\nspeaking of his characteristics. His parents, brothers, and sisters were\r\nliving, at least he had reason to believe so, although they were widely\r\nscattered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArrival No. 6. Samuel Miles, alias Robert King. Samuel was a\r\nrepresentative of Revel's Neck, Somerset Co., Md. His master he regarded\r\nas a \"very fractious man, hard to please.\" The cause of the trouble or\r\nunpleasantness, which resulted in Samuel's Underground adventure, was\r\ntraceable to his master's refusal to allow him to visit his wife. Not\r\nonly was Samuel denied this privilege, but he was equally denied all\r\nprivileges. His master probably thought that Sam had no mind, nor any\r\nneed of a wife. Whether this was really so or not, Sam was shrewd enough\r\nto \"leave his old master with the bag to hold,\" which was sensible.\r\nThirty-one years of Samuel's life were passed in Slavery, ere he\r\nescaped. The remainder of his days he felt bound to have the benefit of\r\nhimself. In leaving home he had to part with his wife and one child,\r\nSarah and little Henry, who were fortunately free.\r\n\r\nOn arriving in Canada Samuel wrote back for his wife, &c., as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ST. CATHARINES, C.W., Aug. 20th, 1855.\r\n\r\n    To MR. WM. STILL, DEAR FRIEND:--It gives me pleasure to inform\r\n    you that I have had the good fortune to reach this northern\r\n    Canaan. I got here yesterday and am in good health and happy in\r\n    the enjoyment of Freedom, but am very anxious to have my wife\r\n    and child here with me.\r\n\r\n    I wish you to write to her immediately on receiving this and let\r\n    her know where I am you will recollect her name Sarah Miles at\r\n    Baltimore on the corner of Hamburg and Eutaw streets. Please\r\n    encourage her in making a start and give her the necessary\r\n    directions how to come. She will please to make the time as\r\n    short as possible in getting through to Canada. Say to my wife\r\n    that I wish her to write immediately to the friends that I told\r\n    her to address as soon as she hears from me. Inform her that I\r\n    now stop in St. Catharines near the Niagara Falls that I am not\r\n    yet in business but expect to get into business very soon--That\r\n    I am in the enjoyment of good health and hoping that this\r\n    communication may find my affectionate wife the same. That I\r\n    have been highly favored with friends throughout my journey I\r\n    wish my wife to write to me as soon as she can and let me know\r\n    how soon I may expect to see her on this side of the Niagara\r\n    River. My wife had better call on Dr. Perkins and perhaps he\r\n    will let her have the money he had in charge for me but that I\r\n    failed of receiving when I left Baltimore. Please direct the\r\n    letter for my wife to Mr. George Lister, in Hill street between\r\n    Howard and Sharp. My compliments to all enquiring friends.\r\n\r\n    Very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n    SAMUEL MILES.\r\n\r\n    P.S. Please send the thread along as a token and my wife will\r\n    understand that all is right. S.M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArrival No. 7. James Henson, alias David Caldwell. James fled from Cecil\r\nCo., Md. He claimed that he was entitled to his freedom according to law\r\nat the age of twenty-eight, but had been unjustly deprived of it. Having\r\nwaited in vain for his free papers for four years, he suspected that he\r\nwas to be dealt with in a manner similar to many others, who had been\r\nwilled free or who had bought their time, and had been shamefully\r\ncheated out of their freedom. So in his judgment he felt that his only\r\nhope lay in making his escape on the Underground Rail Road. He had no\r\nfaith whatever in the man who held him in bondage, Jacob Johnson, but no\r\nother charges of ill treatment, &c., have been found against said\r\nJohnson on the books, save those alluded to above.\r\n\r\nJames was thirty-two years of age, stout and well proportioned, with\r\nmore than average intelligence and resolution. He left a wife and child,\r\nboth free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArrival No. 8. Laura Lewis. Laura arrived from Louisville, Kentucky. She\r\nhad been owned by a widow woman named Lewis, but as lately as the\r\nprevious March her mistress died, leaving her slaves and other property\r\nto be divided among her heirs. As this would necessitate a sale of the\r\nslaves, Laura determined not to be on hand when the selling day came, so\r\nshe took time by the forelock and left. Her appearance indicated that\r\nshe had been among the more favored class of slaves. She was about\r\ntwenty-five years of age, quite stout, of mixed blood, and intelligent,\r\nhaving traveled considerably with her mistress. She had been North in\r\nthis capacity. She left her mother, one brother, and one sister in\r\nLouisville.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArrival No. 9. Elizabeth Banks, from near Easton, Maryland. Her lot had\r\nbeen that of an ordinary slave. Of her slave-life nothing of interest\r\nwas recorded. She had escaped from her owner two and a half years prior\r\nto coming into the hands of the Committee, and had been living in\r\nPennsylvania pretty securely as she had supposed, but she had been\r\nawakened to a sense of her danger by well grounded reports that she was\r\npursued by her claimant, and would be likely to be captured if she\r\ntarried short of Canada. With such facts staring her in the face she was\r\nsent to the Committee for counsel and protection, and by them she was\r\nforwarded on in the usual way. She was about twenty-five years of age,\r\nof a dark, and spare structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArrival No. 10. Simon Hill. This fugitive had escaped from Virginia. The\r\nusual examination was made, and needed help given him by the Committee\r\nwho felt satisfied that he was a poor brother who had been shamefully\r\nwronged, and that he richly deserved sympathy. He was aided and directed\r\nCanada-ward. He was a very humble-looking specimen of the peculiar\r\ninstitution, about twenty-five years of age, medium size, and of a dark\r\nhue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArrival No. 11. Anthony and Albert Brown (brothers), Jones Anderson and\r\nIsaiah.\r\n\r\nThis party escaped from Tanner's Creek, Norfolk, Virginia, where they\r\nhad been owned by John and Henry Holland, oystermen. As slaves they\r\nalleged that they had been subjected to very brutal treatment from their\r\nprofane and ill-natured owners. Not relishing this treatment, Albert and\r\nAnthony came to the conclusion that they understood boating well enough\r\nto escape by water. They accordingly selected one of their master's\r\nsmall oyster-boats, which was pretty-well rigged with sails, and off\r\nthey started for a Northern Shore. They proceeded on a part of their\r\nvoyage merely by guess work, but landed safely, however, about\r\ntwenty-five miles north of Baltimore, though, by no means, on free soil.\r\nThey had no knowledge of the danger that they were then in, but they\r\nwere persevering, and still determined to make their way North, and\r\nthus, at last, success attended their efforts. Their struggles and\r\nexertions having been attended with more of the romantic and tragical\r\nelements than had characterized the undertakings of any of the other\r\nlate passengers, the Committee felt inclined to make a fuller notice of\r\nthem on the book, yet failed to do them justice in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe elder brother was twenty-nine, the younger twenty-seven. Both were\r\nmentally above the average run of slaves. They left wives in Norfolk,\r\nnamed Alexenia and Ellen. While Anthony and Albert, in seeking their\r\nfreedom, were forced to sever their connections with their companions,\r\nthey did not forget them in Canada.\r\n\r\nHow great was their delight in freedom, and tender their regard for\r\ntheir wives, and the deep interest they felt for their brethren and\r\nfriends generally, may be seen from a perusal of the following letters\r\nfrom them:\r\n\r\n\r\n    HAMELTON, March 7th 1856.\r\n\r\n    MR. WM. STILL--_Sir_--I now take the opportunity of writing you\r\n    a few lins hoping to find yourself and famly well as thes lines\r\n    leves me at present, myself and brother, Anthony & Albert\r\n    brown's respects.

STILL:--_kine Sir_:--I am happy to say to you that I\r\n    have jus reseved my letter dated 5 of the present month, but\r\n    previeously had bin in form las night by Mr. J.H.

I had given out the notion of ever seeing my wife again, so\r\n    I have not been attending the office, but am truly sorry I did\r\n    not, you mention in yours of Mr. Henry lewey, he has left this\r\n    city for Boston about 2 weeks ago, we have not herd from him\r\n    yet.\r\n\r\n    A. BROWN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArrival No. 12. George Williams and Charles Holladay. These two\r\ntravelers were about the same age. They were not, however, from the same\r\nneighborhood--they happened to meet each other as they were traveling\r\nthe road. George fled from St. Louis, Charles from Baltimore. George\r\n\"owed service\" to Isaac Hill, a planter; he found no special fault with\r\nhis master's treatment of him; but with Mrs. Hill, touching this point,\r\nhe was thoroughly dissatisfied. She had treated him \"cruelly,\" and it\r\nwas for this reason that he was moved to seek his freedom.\r\n\r\nCharles, being a Baltimorean, had not far to travel, but had pretty\r\nsharp hunters to elude.\r\n\r\nHis claimant, F. Smith, however, had only a term of years claim upon\r\nhim, which was within about two years of being out. This contract for\r\nthe term of years, Charles felt was made without consulting him,\r\ntherefore he resolved to break it without consulting his master. He also\r\ndeclined to have anything to do with the Baltimore and Wilmington R.R.\r\nCo., considering it a prescriptive institution, not worthy of his\r\nconfidence. He started on a fast walk, keeping his eyes wide open,\r\nlooking out for slave-hunters on his right and left. In this way, like\r\nmany others, he reached the Committee safely and was freely aided,\r\nthenceforth traveling in a first class Underground Rail Road car, till\r\nhe reached his journey's end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArrival No. 13. William Govan. Availing himself of a passage on the\r\nschooner of Captain B., William left Petersburg, where he had been owned\r\nby \"Mark Davis, Esq., a retired gentleman,\" rather, a retired negro\r\ntrader.\r\n\r\nWilliam was about thirty-three years of age, and was of a bright orange\r\ncolor. Nothing but an ardent love of liberty prompted him to escape. He\r\nwas quite smart, and a clever-looking man, worth at least $1,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEEP FURROWS ON THE BACK.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS MADDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the passengers who had hitherto arrived with bruised and mangled\r\nbodies received at the hands of slave-holders, none brought a back so\r\nshamefully lacerated by the lash as Thomas Madden. Not a single spot had\r\nbeen exempted from the excoriating cow-hide. A most bloody picture did\r\nthe broad back and shoulders of Thomas present to the eye as he bared\r\nhis wounds for inspection. While it was sad to think, that millions of\r\nmen, women, and children throughout the South were liable to just such\r\nbrutal outrages as Thomas had received, it was a satisfaction to think,\r\nthat this outrage had made a freeman of him.\r\n\r\nHe was only twenty-two years of age, but that punishment convinced him\r\nthat he was fully old enough to leave such a master as E. Ray, who had\r\nalmost murdered him. But for this treatment, Thomas might have remained\r\nin some degree contented in Slavery. He was expected to look after the\r\nfires in the house on Sunday mornings. In a single instance desiring to\r\nbe absent, perhaps for his own pleasure, two boys offered to be his\r\nsubstitute. The services of the boys were accepted, and this gave\r\noffence to the master. This Thomas declared was the head and front of\r\nhis offending. His simple narration of the circumstances of his slave\r\nlife was listened to by the Committee with deep interest and a painful\r\nsense of the situation of slaves under the despotism of such men as Ray.\r\n\r\nAfter being cared for by the Committee he was sent on to Canada. When\r\nthere he wrote back to let the Committee know how he was faring, the\r\nnarrow escape he had on the way, and likewise to convey the fact, that\r\none named \"Rachel,\" left behind, shared a large place in his affections.\r\nThe subjoined letter is the only correspondence of his preserved:\r\n\r\n\r\n    STANFORD, June 1st, 1855, Niagara districk.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:--I set down to inform you that I take the liberty to\r\n    rite for a frend to inform you that he is injoying good health\r\n    and hopes that this will finde you the same he got to this\r\n    cuntry very well except that in Albany he was vary neig taking\r\n    back to his oald home but escaped and when he came to the\r\n    suspention bridg he was so glad that he run for freadums shore\r\n    and when he arived it was the last of October and must look for\r\n    sum wourk for the winter he choped wood until Feruary times are\r\n    good but money is scarce he thinks a great deal of the girl he\r\n    left behind him he thinks that there is non like her here non so\r\n    hansom as his Rachel right and let him hear from you as soon as\r\n    convaniant no more at presant but remain yours,\r\n\r\n    ALBERT METTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"PETE MATTHEWS,\" ALIAS SAMUEL SPARROWS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I MIGHT AS WELL BE IN THE PENITENTIARY, &C.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to the age of thirty-five \"Pete\" had worn the yoke steadily, if not\r\npatiently under William S. Matthews, of Oak Hall, near Temperanceville,\r\nin the State of Virginia. Pete said that his \"master was not a hard\r\nman,\" but the man to whom he \"was hired, George Matthews, was a very\r\ncruel man.\" \"I might as well be in the penitentiary as in his hands,\"\r\nwas his declaration.\r\n\r\nOne day, a short while before Pete \"took out,\" an ox broke into the\r\ntruck patch, and helped himself to choice delicacies, to the full extent\r\nof his capacious stomach, making sad havoc with the vegetables\r\ngenerally. Peter's attention being directed to the ox, he turned him\r\nout, and gave him what he considered proper chastisement, according to\r\nthe mischief he had done. At this liberty taken by Pete, the master\r\nbecame furious. \"He got his gun and threatened to shoot him,\" \"Open your\r\nmouth if you dare, and I will pat the whole load into you,\" said the\r\nenraged master. \"He took out a large dirk-knife, and attempted to stab\r\nme, but I kept out of his way,\" said Pete. Nevertheless the violence of\r\nthe master did not abate until he had beaten Pete over the head and body\r\ntill he was weary, inflicting severe injuries. A great change was at\r\nonce wrought in Pete's mind. He was now ready to adopt any plan that\r\nmight hold out the least encouragement to escape. Having capital to the\r\namount of four dollars only, he felt that he could not do much towards\r\nemploying a conductor, but he had a good pair of legs, and a heart stout\r\nenough to whip two or three slave-catchers, with the help of a pistol.\r\nHappening to know a man who had a pistol for sale, he went to him and\r\ntold him that he wished to purchase it. For one dollar the pistol became\r\nPete's property. He had but three dollars left, but he was determined to\r\nmake that amount answer his purposes under the circumstances. The last\r\ncruel beating maddened him almost to desperation, especially when he\r\nremembered how he had been compelled to work hard night and day, under\r\nMatthews. Then, too, Peter had a wife, whom his master prevented him\r\nfrom visiting; this was not among the least offences with which Pete\r\ncharged his master. Fully bent on leaving, the following Sunday was\r\nfixed by him on which to commence his journey.\r\n\r\nThe time arrived and Pete bade farewell to Slavery, resolved to follow\r\nthe North Star, with his pistol in hand ready for action. After\r\ntraveling about two hundred miles from home he unexpectedly had an\r\nopportunity of using his pistol. To his astonishment he suddenly came\r\nface to face with a former master, whom he had not seen for a long time.\r\nPete desired no friendly intercourse with him whatever; but he perceived\r\nthat his old master recognized him and was bent upon stopping him. Pete\r\nheld on to his pistol, but moved as fast as his wearied limbs would\r\nallow him, in an opposite direction. As he was running, Pete cautiously,\r\ncast his eye over his shoulder, to see what had become of his old\r\nmaster, when to his amazement, he found that a regular chase was being\r\nmade after him. Need of redoubling his pace was quite obvious. In this\r\nhour of peril, Pete's legs saved him.\r\n\r\nAfter this signal leg-victory, Pete had more confidence in his\r\n\"understandings,\" than he had in his old pistol, although he held on to\r\nit until he reached Philadelphia, where he left it in the possession of\r\nthe Secretary of the Committee. Considering it worth saving simply as a\r\nrelic of the Underground Rail Road, it was carefully laid aside. Pete\r\nwas now christened Samuel Sparrows. Mr. Sparrows had the rust of Slavery\r\nwashed off as clean as possible and the Committee furnishing him with\r\nclean clothes, a ticket, and letters of introduction, started him on\r\nCanada-ward, looking quite respectable. And doubtless he felt even more\r\nso than he looked; free air had a powerful effect on such passengers as\r\nSamuel Sparrows.\r\n\r\nThe unpleasantness which grew out of the mischief done by the ox on\r\nGeorge Matthews' farm took place the first of October, 1855. Pete may be\r\ndescribed as a man of unmixed blood, well-made, and intelligent.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"MOSES\" ARRIVES WITH SIX PASSENGERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"NOT ALLOWED TO SEEK A MASTER;\"--\"VERY DEVILISH;\"--FATHER \"LEAVES TWO\r\nLITTLE SONS;\"--\"USED HARD;\"--\"FEARED FALLING INTO THE HANDS OF YOUNG\r\nHEIRS,\" ETC. JOHN CHASE, ALIAS DANIEL FLOYD; BENJAMIN ROSS, ALIAS JAMES\r\nSTEWART; HENRY ROSS, ALIAS LEVIN STEWART; PETER JACKSON, ALIAS STAUNCH\r\nTILGHMAN; JANE KANE, ALIAS CATHARINE KANE, AND ROBERT ROSS.\r\n\r\nThe coming of these passengers was heralded by Thomas Garrett as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS GARRETT'S LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILMINGTON, 12 mo. 29th, 1854.\r\n\r\n    ESTEEMED FRIEND, J. MILLER MCKIM:--We made arrangements last\r\n    night, and sent away Harriet Tubman, with six men and one woman\r\n    to Allen Agnew's, to be forwarded across the country to the\r\n    city. Harriet, and one of the men had worn their shoes off their\r\n    feet, and I gave them two dollars to help fit them out, and\r\n    directed a carriage to be hired at my expense, to take them out,\r\n    but do not yet know the expense. I now have two more from the\r\n    lowest county in Maryland, on the Peninsula, upwards of one\r\n    hundred miles. I will try to get one of our trusty colored men\r\n    to take them to-morrow morning to the Anti-slavery office. You\r\n    can then pass them on.\r\n\r\n    THOMAS GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARRIET TUBMAN had been their \"Moses,\" but not in the sense that Andrew\r\nJohnson was the \"Moses of the colored people.\" She had faithfully gone\r\ndown into Egypt, and had delivered these six bondmen by her own heroism.\r\nHarriet was a woman of no pretensions, indeed, a more ordinary specimen\r\nof humanity could hardly be found among the most unfortunate-looking\r\nfarm hands of the South. Yet, in point of courage, shrewdness and\r\ndisinterested exertions to rescue her fellow-men, by making personal\r\nvisits to Maryland among the slaves, she was without her equal.\r\n\r\nHer success was wonderful. Time and again she made successful visits to\r\nMaryland on the Underground Rail Road, and would be absent for weeks, at\r\na time, running daily risks while making preparations for herself and\r\npassengers. Great fears were entertained for her safety, but she seemed\r\nwholly devoid of personal fear. The idea of being captured by\r\nslave-hunters or slave-holders, seemed never to enter her mind. She was\r\napparently proof against all adversaries. While she thus manifested such\r\nutter personal indifference, she was much more watchful with regard to\r\nthose she was piloting. Half of her time, she had the appearance of one\r\nasleep, and would actually sit down by the road-side and go fast asleep\r\nwhen on her errands of mercy through the South, yet, she would not\r\nsuffer one of her party to whimper once, about \"giving out and going\r\nback,\" however wearied they might be from hard travel day and night. She\r\nhad a very short and pointed rule or law of her own, which implied death\r\nto any who talked of giving out and going back. Thus, in an emergency\r\nshe would give all to understand that \"times were very critical and\r\ntherefore no foolishness would be indulged in on the road.\" That several\r\nwho were rather weak-kneed and faint-hearted were greatly invigorated by\r\nHarriet's blunt and positive manner and threat of extreme measures,\r\nthere could be no doubt.\r\n\r\nAfter having once enlisted, \"they had to go through or die.\" Of course\r\nHarriet was supreme, and her followers generally had full faith in her,\r\nand would back up any word she might utter. So when she said to them\r\nthat \"a live runaway could do great harm by going back, but that a dead\r\none could tell no secrets,\" she was sure to have obedience. Therefore,\r\nnone had to die as traitors on the \"middle passage.\" It is obvious\r\nenough, however, that her success in going into Maryland as she did, was\r\nattributable to her adventurous spirit and utter disregard of\r\nconsequences. Her like it is probable was never known before or since.\r\nOn examining the six passengers who came by this arrival they were thus\r\nrecorded:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember 29th, 1854--John is twenty years of age, chestnut color, of\r\nspare build and smart. He fled from a farmer, by the name of John\r\nCampbell Henry, who resided at Cambridge, Dorchester Co., Maryland. On\r\nbeing interrogated relative to the character of his master, John gave no\r\nvery amiable account of him. He testified that he was a \"hard man\" and\r\nthat he \"owned about one hundred and forty slaves and sometimes he would\r\nsell,\" etc. John was one of the slaves who were \"hired out.\" He \"desired\r\nto have the privilege of hunting his own master.\" His desire was not\r\ngranted. Instead of meekly submitting, John felt wronged, and made this\r\nhis reason for running away. This looked pretty spirited on the part of\r\none so young as John. The Committee's respect for him was not a little\r\nincreased, when they heard him express himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBenjamin was twenty-eight years of age, chestnut color, medium size, and\r\nshrewd. He was the so-called property of Eliza Ann Brodins, who lived\r\nnear Buckstown, in Maryland. Ben did not hesitate to say, in unqualified\r\nterms, that his mistress was \"very devilish.\" He considered his charges,\r\nproved by the fact that three slaves (himself one of them) were required\r\nto work hard and fare meagerly, to support his mistress' family in\r\nidleness and luxury. The Committee paid due attention to his ex parte\r\nstatement, and was obliged to conclude that his argument, clothed in\r\ncommon and homely language, was forcible, if not eloquent, and that he\r\nwas well worthy of aid. Benjamin left his parents besides one sister,\r\nMary Ann Williamson, who wanted to come away on the Underground Rail\r\nRoad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry left his wife, Harriet Ann, to be known in future by the name of\r\n\"Sophia Brown.\" He was a fellow-servant of Ben's, and one of the\r\nsupports of Eliza A. Brodins.\r\n\r\nHenry was only twenty-two, but had quite an insight into matters and\r\nthings going on among slaves and slave-holders generally, in country\r\nlife. He was the father of two small children, whom he had to leave\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter was owned by George Wenthrop, a farmer, living near Cambridge, Md.\r\nIn answer to the question, how he had been used, he said \"hard.\" Not a\r\npleasant thought did he entertain respecting his master, save that he\r\nwas no longer to demand the sweat of Peter's brow. Peter left parents,\r\nwho were free; he was born before they were emancipated, consequently,\r\nhe was retained in bondage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJane, aged twenty-two, instead of regretting that she had unadvisedly\r\nleft a kind mistress and indulgent master, who had afforded her\r\nnecessary comforts, affirmed that her master, \"Rash Jones, was the worst\r\nman in the country.\" The Committee were at first disposed to doubt her\r\nsweeping statement, but when they heard particularly how she had been\r\ntreated, they thought Catharine had good ground for all that she said.\r\nPersonal abuse and hard usage, were the common lot of poor slave girls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert was thirty-five years of age, of a chestnut color, and well made.\r\nHis report was similar to that of many others. He had been provided with\r\nplenty of hard drudgery--hewing of wood and drawing of water, and had\r\nhardly been treated as well as a gentleman would treat a dumb brute. His\r\nfeelings, therefore, on leaving his old master and home, were those of\r\nan individual who had been unjustly in prison for a dozen years and had\r\nat last regained his liberty.\r\n\r\nThe civilization, religion, and customs under which Robert and his\r\ncompanions had been raised, were, he thought, \"very wicked.\" Although\r\nthese travelers were all of the field-hand order, they were,\r\nnevertheless, very promising, and they anticipated better days in\r\nCanada. Good advice was proffered them on the subject of temperance,\r\nindustry, education, etc. Clothing, food and money were also given them\r\nto meet their wants, and they were sent on their way rejoicing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESCAPED FROM \"A WORTHLESS SOT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ATKINSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn was a prisoner of hope under James Ray, of Portsmouth, Va., whom he\r\ndeclared to be \"a worthless sot.\" This character was fully set forth,\r\nbut the description is too disgusting for record. John was a dark\r\nmulatto, thirty-one years of age, well-formed and intelligent. For some\r\nyears before escaping he had been in the habit of hiring his time for\r\n$120 per annum. Daily toiling to support his drunken and brutal master,\r\nwas a hardship that John felt keenly, but was compelled to submit to up\r\nto the day of his escape.\r\n\r\nA part of John's life he had suffered many abuses from his oppressor,\r\nand only a short while before freeing himself, the auction-block was\r\nheld up before his troubled mind. This caused him to take the first\r\ndaring step towards Canada,--to leave his wife, Mary, without bidding\r\nher good-bye, or saying a word to her as to his intention of fleeing.\r\n\r\nJohn came as a private passenger on one of the Richmond steamers, and\r\nwas indebted to the steward of the boat for his accommodations. Having\r\nbeen received by the Committee, he was cared for and sent on his journey\r\nCanada-ward. There he was happy, found employment and wanted for nothing\r\nbut his wife and clothing left in Virginia. On these two points he wrote\r\nseveral times with considerable feeling.\r\n\r\nSome slaves who hired their time in addition to the payment of their\r\nmonthly hire, purchased nice clothes for themselves, which they usually\r\nvalued highly, so much so, that after escaping they would not be\r\ncontented until they had tried every possible scheme to secure them.\r\nThey would write back continually, either to their friends in the North\r\nor South, hoping thus to procure them.\r\n\r\nNot unfrequently the persons who rendered them assistance in the South,\r\nwould be entrusted with all their effects, with the understanding, that\r\nsuch valuables would be forwarded to a friend or to the Committee at the\r\nearliest opportunity. The Committee strongly protested against fugitives\r\nwriting back to the South (through the mails) on account of the\r\nliability of getting parties into danger, as all such letters were\r\nliable to be intercepted in order to the discovery of the names of such\r\nas aided the Underground Rail Road. To render needless this writing to\r\nthe South the Committee often submitted to be taxed with demands to\r\nrescue clothing as well as wives, etc., belonging to such as had been\r\nalready aided.\r\n\r\nThe following letters are fair samples of a large number which came to\r\nthe Committee touching the matter of clothing, etc.:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ST. CATHARINES, Sept. 4th.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:--I now embrace this favorable opportunity of writing\r\n    you a few lines to inform you that I am quite well and arrived\r\n    here safe, and I hope that these few lines may find you and your\r\n    family the same. I hope you will intercede for my clothes and as\r\n    soon as they come please to send them to me, and if you have not\r\n    time, get Dr. Lundy to look out for them, and when they come be\r\n    very careful in sending them. I wish you would copy off this\r\n    letter and give it to the Steward, and tell him to give it to\r\n    Henry Lewy and tell him to give it to my wife. Brother sends his\r\n    love to you and all the family and he is overjoyed at seeing me\r\n    arrive safe, he can hardly contain himself; also he wants to see\r\n    his wife very much, and says when she comes he hopes you will\r\n    send her on as soon as possible. Jerry Williams' love, together\r\n    with all of us. I had a message for Mr. Lundy, but I forgot it\r\n    when I was there. No more at present, but remain your ever\r\n    grateful and sincere friend,\r\n\r\n    JOHN ATKINSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    ST. CATHARINES, C.W., Oct. 5th, 1854.\r\n\r\n    MR. WM. STILL:--Dear Sir--I have learned of my friend, Richmond\r\n    Bohm, that my clothes were in Philadelphia. Will you have the\r\n    kindness to see Dr. Lundy and if he has my clothes in charge, or\r\n    knows about them, for him to send them on to me immediately, as\r\n    I am in great need of them. I would like to have them put in a\r\n    small box, and the overcoat I left at your house to be put in\r\n    the box with them, to be sent to the care of my friend, Hiram\r\n    Wilson. On receipt of this letter, I desire you to write a few\r\n    lines to my wife, Mary Atkins, in the care of my friend, Henry\r\n    Lowey, stating that I am well and hearty and hoping that she is\r\n    the same. Please tell her to remember my love to her mother and\r\n    her cousin, Emelin, and her husband, and Thomas Hunter; also to\r\n    my father and mother. Please request her to write to me\r\n    immediately, for her to be of good courage, that I love her\r\n    better than ever. I would like her to come on as soon as she\r\n    can, but for her to write and let me know when she is going to\r\n    start.\r\n\r\n    Affectionately Yours,\r\n\r\n    JOHN ATKINS.\r\n\r\n    W.H. ATKINSON, Fugitive, Oct., 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BUTCHER, ALIAS WILLIAM T. MITCHELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"HE WAS ABUSEFUL.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis passenger reported himself from Massey's Cross-Roads, near\r\nGeorgetown, Maryland. William gave as his reason for being found\r\ndestitute, and under the necessity of asking aid, that a man by the name\r\nof William Boyer, who followed farming, had deprived him of his hard\r\nearnings, and also claimed him as his property; and withal that he had\r\nabused him for years, and recently had \"threatened to sell\" him. This\r\nthreat made his yoke too intolerable to be borne.\r\n\r\nHe here began to think and plan for the future as he had never done\r\nbefore. Fortunately he was possessed with more than an average amount of\r\nmother wit, and he soon comprehended the requirements of the Underground\r\nRail Road. He saw exactly that he must have resolution and\r\nself-dependence, very decided, in order to gain the victory over Boyer.\r\nIn his hour of trial his wife, Phillis, and child, John Wesley, who were\r\nfree, caused him much anxiety; but his reason taught him that it was his\r\nduty to throw off the yoke at all hazards, and he acted accordingly. Of\r\ncourse he left behind his wife and child. The interview which the\r\nCommittee held with William was quite satisfactory, and he was duly\r\naided and regularly despatched by the name of William T. Mitchell. He\r\nwas about twenty-eight years of age, of medium size, and of quite a dark\r\nhue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"WHITE ENOUGH TO PASS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Wesley Gibson represented himself to be not only the slave, but\r\nalso the son of William Y. Day, of Taylor's Mount, Maryland. The\r\nfaintest shade of colored blood was hardly discernible in this\r\npassenger. He relied wholly on his father's white blood to secure him\r\nfreedom. Having resolved to serve no longer as a slave, he concluded to\r\n\"hold up his head and put on airs.\" He reached Baltimore safely without\r\nbeing discovered or suspected of being on the Underground Rail Road, as\r\nfar as he was aware of. Here he tried for the first time to pass for\r\nwhite; the attempt proved a success beyond his expectation. Indeed he\r\ncould but wonder how it was that he had never before hit upon such an\r\nexpedient to rid himself of his unhappy lot. Although a man of only\r\ntwenty-eight years of age, he was foreman of his master's farm, but he\r\nwas not particularly favored in any way on this account. His master and\r\nfather endeavored to hold the reins very tightly upon him. Not even\r\nallowing him the privilege of visiting around on neighboring\r\nplantations. Perhaps the master thought the family likeness was rather\r\ntoo discernible. John believed that on this account all privileges were\r\ndenied him, and he resolved to escape. His mother, Harriet, and sister,\r\nFrances, were named as near kin whom he had left behind. John was quite\r\nsmart, and looked none the worse for having so much of his master's\r\nblood in his veins. The master was alone to blame for John's escape, as\r\nhe passed on his (the master's) color.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nESCAPING WITH MASTER'S CARRIAGES AND HORSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARRIET SHEPHARD, AND HER FIVE CHILDREN, WITH FIVE OTHER PASSENGERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning about the first of November, in 1855, the sleepy,\r\nslave-holding neighborhood of Chestertown, Maryland, was doubtless\r\ndeeply excited on learning that eleven head of slaves, four head of\r\nhorses, and two carriages were missing. It is but reasonable to suppose\r\nthat the first report must have produced a shock, scarcely less stunning\r\nthan an earthquake. Abolitionists, emissaries, and incendiaries were\r\nfarther below par than ever. It may be supposed that cursings and\r\nthreatenings were breathed out by a deeply agitated community for days\r\nin succession.\r\n\r\nHarriet Shephard, the mother of five children, for whom she felt of\r\ncourse a mother's love, could not bear the thought of having her\r\noffspring compelled to wear the miserable yoke of Slavery, as she had\r\nbeen compelled to do. By her own personal experience, Harriet could very\r\nwell judge what their fate would be when reaching man and womanhood. She\r\ndeclared that she had never received \"kind treatment.\" It was not on\r\nthis account, however, that she was prompted to escape. She was actuated\r\nby a more disinterested motive than this. She was chiefly induced to\r\nmake the bold effort to save her children from having to drag the chains\r\nof Slavery as she herself had done.\r\n\r\nAnna Maria, Edwin, Eliza Jane, Mary Ann, and John Henry were the names\r\nof the children for whom she was willing to make any sacrifice. They\r\nwere young; and unable to walk, and she was penniless, and unable to\r\nhire a conveyance, even if she had known any one who would have been\r\nwilling to risk the law in taking them a night's journey. So there was\r\nno hope in these directions. Her rude intellect being considered, she\r\nwas entitled to a great deal of credit for seizing the horses and\r\ncarriages belonging to her master, as she did it for the liberation of\r\nher children.\r\n\r\nKnowing others at the same time, who were wanting to visit Canada, she\r\nconsulted with five of this class, males and females, and they mutually\r\ndecided to travel together.\r\n\r\nIt is not likely that they knew much about the roads, nevertheless they\r\nreached Wilmington, Delaware, pretty direct, and ventured up into the\r\nheart of the town in carriages, looking as innocent as if they were\r\ngoing to meeting to hear an old-fashioned Southern sermon--\"Servants,\r\nobey your masters.\" Of course, the distinguished travelers were\r\nimmediately reported to the noted Thomas Garrett, who was accustomed to\r\ntransact the affairs of the Underground Rail Road in a cool masterly\r\nway. But, on this occasion, there was but little time for deliberation,\r\nbut much need of haste to meet the emergency. He at once decided, that\r\nthey must immediately be separated from the horses and carriages, and\r\ngot out of Wilmington as quickly as possible. With the courage and\r\nskill, so characteristic of Garrett, the fugitives, under escort, were\r\nsoon on their way to Kennett Square (a hot-bed of abolitionists and\r\nstock-holders of the Underground Rail Road), which place they reached\r\nsafely. It so happened, that they reached Long Wood meeting-house in the\r\nevening, at which place a fair circle had convened. Being invited, they\r\nstayed awhile in the meeting, then, after remaining all night with one\r\nof the Kennett friends, they were brought to Downingtown early in the\r\nmorning and thence, by daylight, within a short distance of Kimberton,\r\nand found succor with friend Lewis, at the old headquarters of the\r\nfugitives.\r\n\r\n[A letter may be found from Miss G.A. Lewis, on page thirty-nine,\r\nthrowing much light on this arrival]. After receiving friendly aid and\r\nadvice while there, they were forwarded to the Committee in\r\nPhiladelphia. Here further aid was afforded them, and as danger was\r\nquite obvious, they were completely divided and disguised, so that the\r\nCommittee felt that they might safely be sent on to Canada in one of the\r\nregular trains considered most private.\r\n\r\nConsidering the condition of the slave mother and her children and\r\nfriends, all concerned rejoiced, that they had had the courage to use\r\ntheir master's horses and vehicles as they did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEIGHT AND A HALF MONTHS SECRETED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON SOMLOR, ALIAS JAMES MOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut few could tell of having been eye-witnesses to outrages more\r\nrevolting and disgraceful than Washington Somlor. He arrived per steamer\r\nPennsylvania (secreted), directly from Norfolk, Virginia, in 1855. He\r\nwas thirty-two years of age--a man of medium size and quite intelligent.\r\nA merchant by the name of Smith owned Washington.\r\n\r\nEight and a half months before escaping, Washington had been secreted in\r\norder to shun both master and auction-block. Smith believed in selling,\r\nflogging, cobbing, paddling, and all other kinds of torture, by which he\r\ncould inflict punishment in order to make the slaves feel his power. He\r\nthus tyrannized over about twenty-five head.\r\n\r\nBeing naturally passionate, when in a brutal mood, he made his slaves\r\nsuffer unmercifully. Said Washington, \"On one occasion, about two months\r\nbefore I was secreted, he had five of the slaves (some of them women)\r\ntied across a barrel, lashed with the cow-hide and then cobbed--this was\r\na common practice.\"\r\n\r\nSuch treatment was so inhuman and so incredible, that the Committee\r\nhesitated at first to give credence to the statement, and only yielded\r\nwhen facts and evidences were given which seemed incontestible.\r\n\r\nThe first effort to come away was made on the steamship City of\r\nRichmond. Within sixty miles of Philadelphia, in consequence of the ice\r\nobstruction in the river, the steamer had to go back. How sad Washington\r\nfelt at thus having his hopes broken to pieces may be imagined but\r\ncannot be described. Great as was his danger, when the steamer returned\r\nto Norfolk, he was safely gotten off the boat and under the eye of\r\nofficers walked away. Again he was secreted in his old doleful quarters,\r\nwhere he waited patiently for the Spring. It came. Again the opportunity\r\nfor another trial was presented, and it was seized unhesitatingly. This\r\ntime, his tried faith was rewarded with success. He came through safely\r\nto the Committee's satisfaction as well as his own. The recital of his\r\nsufferings and experience had a very inspiring effect on those who had\r\nthe pleasure of seeing Wash. in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nAlthough closely secreted in Norfolk, he had, through friends, some\r\nlittle communication with the outside world. Among other items of\r\ninformation which came to his ears, was a report that his master was\r\nbeing pressed by his creditors, and had all his slaves advertised for\r\nsale. An item still more sad also reached his ear, to the effect that\r\nhis wife had been sold away to North Carolina, and thus separated from\r\nher child, two years old. The child was given as a present to a niece of\r\nthe master. While this is only a meagre portion of his interesting\r\nstory, it was considered at the time sufficient to identify him should\r\nthe occasion ever require it. We content ourselves, therefore, simply\r\nwith giving what was recorded on the book. Wash. spent a short while in\r\nPhiladelphia in order to recruit, after which, he went on North, where\r\ncolored men were free.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTHUR FOWLER, ALIAS BENJAMIN JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nArthur came from Spring Hill, Maryland. Edward Fowler held Arthur in\r\nfetters and usurped authority over him as his lord and master. Arthur\r\nsaw certain signs connected with his master's family which presaged to\r\nhim that the day was not far distant, when somebody would have to be\r\nsold to raise money to pamper the appetites of some of the superior\r\nmembers of the patriarchal institution. Among these provocations were\r\nindulgence in a great deal of extravagance, and the growing up of a\r\nnumber of young masters and mistresses. Arthur would often look at the\r\nheirs, and the very thought of their coming into possession, would make\r\nhim tremble. Nothing so affected Arthur's mind so much in moving him to\r\nmake a bold stroke for freedom as these heirs.\r\n\r\nUnder his old master, the usage had been bad enough, but he feared that\r\nit would be a great deal worse under the sons and daughters. He\r\ntherefore wisely concluded to avoid the impending danger by availing\r\nhimself of the Underground Rail Road. After completing such arrangements\r\nas he deemed necessary, he started, making his way along pretty\r\nsuccessfully, with the exception of a severe encounter with Jack Frost,\r\nby which his feet were badly bitten. He was not discouraged, however,\r\nbut was joyful over his victory and hopeful in view of his prospects in\r\nCanada. Arthur was about thirty years of age, medium size, and of a dark\r\ncolor. The Committee afforded him needed assistance, and sent him off.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDRY ARRIVALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the 1st of June, 1855, the following arrivals were noted in the\r\nrecord book:\r\n\r\nEMORY ROBERTS, _alias_ WILLIAM KEMP, Talbot Co., Maryland; DANIEL PAYNE,\r\nRichmond, Virginia; HARRIET MAYO, JOHN JUDAH, and RICHARD BRADLEY,\r\nPetersburg and Richmond; JAMES CRUMMILL, SAMUEL JONES, TOLBERT JONES,\r\nand HENRY HOWARD, Haverford Co., Maryland; LEWIS CHILDS, Richmond,\r\nDANIEL BENNETT, _alias_ HENRY WASHINGTON, and wife (MARTHA,) and two\r\nchildren (GEORGE and a nameless babe).\r\n\r\nThe road at this time, was doing a fair business, in a quiet way.\r\nPassengers were managing to come, without having to suffer in any very\r\nviolent manner, as many had been called upon to do in making similar\r\nefforts. The success attending some of these passengers was partly\r\nattributable to the intelligence of individuals, who, for years, had\r\nbeen planning and making preparations to effect the end in view.\r\nBesides, the favorableness of the weather tended also to make travel\r\nmore pleasant than in colder seasons of the year.\r\n\r\nWhile matters were thus favorable, the long stories of individual\r\nsuffering and of practices and customs among young and old masters and\r\nmistresses, were listened to attentively, although the short summer\r\nnights hardly afforded sufficient opportunity for writing out details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmory arrived safely from Talbot county. As a slave, he had served\r\nEdward Lloyd. He gave his master the character of treating his slaves\r\nwith great severity. The \"lash\" was freely used \"on women as well as\r\nmen, old and young.\" In this kind of property Lloyd had invested to the\r\nextent of \"about five hundred head,\" so Emory thought. Food and clothing\r\nfor this large number were dealt out very stintedly, and daily suffering\r\nwas the common lot of slaves under Lloyd.\r\n\r\nEmory was induced to leave, to avoid a terrible flogging, which had been\r\npromised him for the coming Monday. He was a married man, but exercised\r\nno greater control over his wife than over himself. She was hired on a\r\nneighboring plantation; the way did not seem open for her to accompany\r\nhim, so he had to leave her behind. His mother, brothers, and sisters\r\nhad to be left also. The ties of kindred usually strong in the breasts\r\nof slaves, were hard for Emory to break, but, by a firm resolution, that\r\nhe would not stay on Lloyd's plantation to endure the impending\r\nflogging, he was nerved to surmount every obstacle in the way of\r\ncarrying his intention into execution. He came to the Committee hungry\r\nand in want of clothing, and was aided in the usual way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaniel Payne. This traveler was a man who might be said to be full of\r\nyears, infirm, and well-nigh used up under a Virginia task-master. But\r\nwithin the old man's breast a spark was burning for freedom, and he was\r\ndesirous of reaching free land, on which to lay his body when life's\r\ntoil ended. So the Committee sympathized with him, aided him and sent\r\nhim on to Canada. He was owned by a man named M.W. Morris, of Richmond,\r\nwhence he fled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHarriet Mayo, John Judah, and Richard Bradley were the next who brought\r\njoy and victory with them.\r\n\r\nHarriet was a tall, well-made, intelligent young woman, twenty-two years\r\nof age. She spoke with feelings of much bitterness against her master,\r\nJames Cuthbert, saying that he was a \"very hard man,\" at the same time,\r\nadding that his \"wife was still worse.\" Harriet \"had been sold once.\"\r\nShe admitted however, having been treated kindly a part of her life. In\r\nescaping, she had to leave her \"poor old mother\" with no hope of ever\r\nseeing her again; likewise she regretted having to leave three brothers,\r\nwho kindly aided her to escape. But having her heart bent on freedom,\r\nshe resolved that nothing should deter her from putting forth efforts to\r\nget out of Slavery.\r\n\r\nJohn was a mulatto, of genteel address, well clothed, and looked as if\r\nhe had been \"well fed.\" Miss Eliza Lambert had the honor of owning John,\r\nand was gracious enough to allow him to hire his time for one hundred\r\nand ten dollars per annum. After this sum was punctually paid, John\r\ncould do what he pleased with any surplus earnings. Now, as he was fond\r\nof nice clothing, he was careful to earn a balance sufficient to gratify\r\nthis love. By similar means, many slaves were seen in southern cities\r\nelegantly dressed, and, strangers and travelers from the North gave all\r\nthe credit to \"indulgent masters,\" not knowing the facts in the case.\r\n\r\nJohn accused his mistress of being hard in money matters, not caring how\r\nthe servants fared, so she got \"plenty of money out of them.\" For\r\nhimself, however, he admitted that he had never experienced as great\r\nabuses as many had. He was fortunate in being wedded to a free wife, who\r\nwas privy to all his plans and schemes looking forth to freedom, and\r\nfully acquiesced in the arrangement of matters, promising to come on\r\nafter he should reach Canada. This promise was carried out in due time,\r\nand they were joyfully re-united under the protection of the British\r\nLion.\r\n\r\nRichard was about twenty-seven. For years the hope of freedom had\r\noccupied his thoughts, and many had been the longing desires to see the\r\nway open by which he could safely get rid of oppression. He was\r\nsufficiently intelligent to look at Slavery in all its bearings, and to\r\nsmart keenly under even ordinarily mild treatment. Therefore, he was\r\nvery happy in the realization of his hopes. In the recital of matters\r\ntouching his slave life, he alluded to his master, Samuel Ball, as a\r\n\"very hard man,\" utterly unwilling to allow his servants any chance\r\nwhatever. For reasons which he considered judicious, he kept the matter\r\nof his contemplated escape wholly private, not even revealing it to his\r\nwife. Probably he felt that she would not be willing to give him up, not\r\neven for freedom, as long as she could not go too. Her name was Emily,\r\nand she belonged to William Bolden. How she felt when she learned of her\r\nhusband's escape is for the imagination to picture. These three\r\ninteresting passengers were brought away snugly secreted in Captain B's.\r\nschooner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES CRUMMILL, SAMUAL and TOLBERT JONES and HENRY HOWARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis party united to throw off the yoke in Haverford county, Md.\r\n\r\nJames, Samuel and Tolbert had been owned by William Hutchins. They\r\nagreed in giving Hutchins the character of being a notorious\r\n\"frolicker,\" and a \"very hard master.\" Under him, matters were growing\r\n\"worse and worse.\" Before the old master's death times were much better.\r\n\r\nHenry did not live under the same authority that his three companions\r\nwere subjected to, but belonged to Philip Garrison. The continual threat\r\nto sell harassed Henry so much, that he saw no chance of peace or\r\nhappiness in the future. So one day the master laid the \"last straw on\r\nthe camel's back,\" and not another day would Henry stay. Many times it\r\nrequired a pretty heavy pressure to start off a number of young men, but\r\nin this instance they seemed unwilling to wait to be worn out under the\r\nyoke and violent treatment, or to become encumbered with wives and\r\nchildren before leaving. All were single, with the exception of James,\r\nwhose wife was free, and named Charlotte; she understood about his going\r\nto Canada, and, of course, was true to him.\r\n\r\nThese young men had of course been reared under circumstances altogether\r\nunfavorable to mental development. Nevertheless they had fervent\r\naspirations to strike for freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLewis Giles belonged, in the prison-house of bondage, in the city of\r\nRichmond, and owed service to a Mr. Lewis Hill, who made it a business\r\nto keep slaves expressly to hire out, just as a man keeps a livery\r\nstable. Lewis was not satisfied with this arrangement; he could see no\r\nfair play in it. In fact, he was utterly at variance with the entire\r\nsystem of Slavery, and, a long time before he left, had plans laid with\r\na view of escaping. Through one of the Underground Rail Road Agents the\r\nglad tidings were borne to him that a passage might be procured on a\r\nschooner for twenty-five dollars. Lewis at once availed himself of this\r\noffer, and made his arrangements accordingly. He, however, made no\r\nmention of this contemplated movement to his wife, Louisa; and, to her\r\nastonishment, he was soon among the missing. Lewis was a fine-looking\r\n\"article,\" six feet high, well proportioned, and of a dark chestnut\r\ncolor, worth probably $1200, in the Richmond market. Touching his slave\r\nlife, he said that he had been treated \"pretty well,\" except that he\r\n\"had been sold several times.\" Intellectually he was above the average\r\nrun of slaves. He left on the twenty-third of April, and arrived about\r\nthe second of June, having, in the meantime, encountered difficulties\r\nand discouragements of various kinds. His safe arrival, therefore, was\r\nattended with unusual rejoicing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaniel Bennett and his wife and children were the next in order. A woman\r\npoorly clad with a babe just one month old in her arms, and a little boy\r\nat her side, who could scarcely toddle, together with a husband who had\r\nnever dared under penalty of the laws to protect her or her little ones,\r\npresented a most painfully touching picture. It was easy enough to see,\r\nthat they had been crushed. The husband had been owned by Captain James\r\nTaylor--the wife and children by George Carter.\r\n\r\nThe young mother gave Carter a very bad character, affirming, that it\r\nwas a \"common practice with him to flog the slaves, stripped entirely\r\nnaked\"--that she had herself been so flogged, since she had been a\r\nmarried woman. How the husband was treated, the record book is silent.\r\nHe was about thirty-two--the wife about twenty-seven. Especial pains\r\nwere taken to provide aid and sympathy to this family in their\r\ndestitution, fleeing under such peculiarly trying circumstances and from\r\nsuch loathsome brutality. They were from Aldie P.O., London County,\r\nVirginia, and passed through the hands of the Committee about the 11th\r\nof June. What has been their fate since is not known.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDRY ARRIVALS ABOUT JANUARY FIRST, 1855.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVERENEA MERCER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe steamship Pennsylvania, on one of her regular trips from Richmond,\r\nbrought one passenger, of whom the Captain had no knowledge; no\r\npermission had been asked of any officer of the boat. Nevertheless,\r\nVerenea Mercer managed, by the most extraordinary strategy, to secrete\r\nherself on the steamer, and thus succeeded in reaching Philadelphia. She\r\nwas following her husband, who escaped about nine months before her.\r\n\r\nVerenea was about forty-one years of age, of a dark chestnut color,\r\nprepossessing in manners, intelligent and refined. She belonged to the\r\nslave population of Richmond, and was owned by Thomas W. Quales.\r\nAccording to her testimony, she had not received severe treatment during\r\nthe eight and a half years that she had been in his hands. Previous to\r\nhis becoming the owner of Verenea, it might have been otherwise,\r\nalthough nothing is recorded in proof of this inference, except that she\r\nhad the misfortune to lose her first husband by a sale. Of course she\r\nwas left a widow, in which state she remained nine years, at the\r\nexpiration of which period, she married a man by the name of James\r\nMercer, whose narrative may be found on p. 54.\r\n\r\nHow James got off, and where he went, Verenea knew quite well;\r\nconsequently, in planning to reach him, she resorted to the same means\r\nby which he achieved success. The Committee rendered her the usual aid,\r\nand sent her on direct to her husband in Canada. Without difficulty of\r\nany kind she reached there safely, and found James with arms wide open\r\nto embrace her. Frequent tidings reached the Committee, that they were\r\ngetting along quite well in Toronto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the same day (January 1st), PETER DERRICKSON and CHARLES PURNELL\r\narrived from Berlin, Worcester county, Maryland. Both were able-bodied\r\nyoung men, twenty-four and twenty-six years of age, just the kind that a\r\ntrader, or an experienced slave-holder in the farming business, would be\r\nmost likely to select for doing full days' work in the field, or for\r\nbringing high prices in the market.\r\n\r\nPeter toiled and toiled, with twenty others, on John Derrickson's farm.\r\nAnd although Derrickson was said to be a \"mild master,\" Peter decidedly\r\nobjected to working for him for nothing. He thought over his situation a\r\ngreat deal, and finally came to the conclusion, that he must get from\r\nunder the yoke, if possible, before entering another New Year. His\r\nfriend Charles he felt could be confided in, therefore he made up his\r\nmind, that he would broach the question of Canada and the Underground\r\nRail Road to him. Charles was equally ready and willing to enter into\r\nany practical arrangements by which he could get rid of his no-pay\r\ntask-master, and be landed safely in Canada. After taking into account\r\nthe dangers likely to attend such a struggle, they concluded that they\r\nwould risk all and try their luck, as many had done before them.\r\n\r\n\"What made you leave, Charles?\" said a member of the Committee.\r\n\r\n\"I left because I wanted my time and money for myself.\"\r\n\r\nNo one could gainsay such a plain common-sense answer as that. The fact,\r\nthat he had to leave his parents, three brothers, and five sisters, all\r\nin slavery, brought sad reflections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLLOYD HACKET, alias Perry Watkins and WILLIAM HENRY JOHNSON, alias John\r\nWesley.\r\n\r\nNo weather was too cold for travel, nor way too rough, when the slave\r\nwas made to feel by his heartless master, that he was going to sell him\r\nor starve him to death.\r\n\r\nLloyd had toiled on until he had reached fifty-five, before he came to\r\nthe conclusion, that he could endure the treatment of his master, John\r\nGriffin, no longer, simply because \"he was not good to feed and clothe,\"\r\nand was a \"great fighter.\" Moreover, he would \"never suffer his slaves\r\nto stop work on account of bad weather.\" Not only was his master cruel\r\nin these particulars, but he was equally cruel with regard to selling.\r\nGeorgia was continually held up to the slaves with a view of producing a\r\nwholesome fear, but in this instance, as in many similar ones, it only\r\nawakened desires to seek flight via the Underground Rail Road.\r\n\r\nLloyd, convinced by experience, that matters with him would be no\r\nbetter, but worse and worse, resolved that he would start with the\r\nopening of the New Year to see if he could not find a better country\r\nthan the one that he was then in.\r\n\r\nHe consulted William, who, although a young man of only twenty-four\r\nyears of age, had the hate of slavery exceedingly strong in his heart,\r\nand was at once willing to accompany Lloyd--ready to face cold weather\r\nand start on a long walk if freedom could be thus purchased, and his\r\nmaster, John Hall, thus defeated. So Lloyd took a heroic leave of his\r\nwife, Mary Ann, and their little boy, one brother, one sister, and two\r\nnieces, and at once set out with William, like pilgrims and strangers\r\nseeking a better country--where they would not have to go \"hungry\" and\r\nbe \"worked hard in all weather,\" threatened with the auction-block, and\r\nbrutally flogged if they merely seemed unwilling to endure a yoke too\r\ngrievous to be borne. Both these travelers were mulattoes, and but for\r\nthe crushing influences that they had lived under would have made smart\r\nmen--as it was they showed plainly, that they were men of shrewd sense.\r\n\r\nInadvertently at the time of their arrival, the names of the State and\r\nplace whence they fled were not entered on the book.\r\n\r\nIn traveling they suffered severely from hunger and the long distance\r\nthey had to walk, but having succeeded victoriously they were prepared\r\nto rejoice all the more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVID EDWARDS. John J. Slater, coachmaker of Petersburg, Virginia, if he\r\nis still living, and should see these items, may solve what may have\r\nbeen for years a great mystery to him--namely, that David, his\r\nman-servant, was enjoying himself in Philadelphia about the first week\r\nin January, 1855, receiving free accommodations and obtaining letters of\r\nintroduction to friends in Canada. Furthermore, that David alleged that\r\nhe was induced to escape because he (the coachmaker) was a very hard\r\nman, who took every dollar of his earnings, from which he would dole out\r\nto him only one dollar a week for board, etc., a sum less than David\r\ncould manage to get along with.\r\n\r\nDavid was thirty years of age, black, weighed one hundred and forty-five\r\npounds, and was worth one thousand dollars. He left his wife behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEVERLY GOOD and GEORGE WALKER, alias Austin Valentine. These passengers\r\ncame from Petersburg, per steamship Pennsylvania. Richard Perry was\r\nlording it over Beverly, who was a young man of twenty-four years of\r\nage, dark, medium size, and possessed of a quick intellect--just the man\r\nthat an Underground Rail Road agent in the South could approach with\r\nassurance with questions such as these--\"What do you think of Slavery?\"\r\n\"Did you ever hear of the Underground Rail Road?\" \"How would you like to\r\nbe free?\" \"Would you be willing to go to Canada if you could get off\r\nsafely,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\nSuch questions at once kindled into a flame the sparks of freedom lying\r\ndormant in the heart. Although uttered in a whisper, they had a wondrous\r\nring about them, and a wide-awake bondman instantly grasped their\r\nmeaning. Beverly was of this class; he needed no arguments to prove that\r\nhe was daily robbed of his rights--that Slavery was merciless and\r\nfreedom the God-given right of all mankind. Of him, therefore, there was\r\nno fear that he would betray his trust or flinch too soon when cramped\r\nup in his hiding-place on the steamer.\r\n\r\nHis comrade, George, was likewise of the same mettle, and was aided in\r\nthe same way. George, however, had more age on his side, being about\r\nforty-three. He was about six feet high, with marked physical and mental\r\nabilities, but Slavery had had its heel upon his neck. And who could\r\nthen have risen?\r\n\r\nEliza Jones held the deed for George, and by her he was hired as foreman\r\nin a tobacco factory, in which position his duties were\r\nonerous--especially to one with a heavy, bleeding heart, throbbing daily\r\nfor freedom, while, at the same time, mournfully brooding over past\r\nwrongs. Of these wrongs one incident must suffice. He had been married\r\ntwice, and had been the father of six children by his first wife; at the\r\ncommand of his owner the wedded relations were abruptly broken, and he\r\nwas obliged to seek another wife. In entering this story on the book at\r\nthe time of the arrival, the concluding words were written thus: \"This\r\nstory is thrilling, but time will not allow its being penned.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough safely under the protection of the British Lion, George's heart\r\nwas in Virginia, where his wife was retained. As he could not return for\r\nher deliverance, he was wise enough to resort to the pen, hoping in this\r\nway to effect his grand object, as the following letter will show:\r\n\r\n\r\n    TORONTO, January 25th, 1855.\r\n\r\n    DEAR FRIEND STILL:--George Walker, of Petersburg, Va., is now in\r\n    my office, and requests me to write a letter to you, and request\r\n    you to write to his wife, after or according to the instructions\r\n    he gave to his friend, John Brown, in your city, with whom he\r\n    says you are acquainted. You will understand, of course, his\r\n    reason for wanting the letter wrote and posted at Philadelphia.\r\n    You will please attend to it and address a letter to him\r\n    (Walker) in my care. He and Beverly Good, his comrade, tender\r\n    much love to you. Send them on; we are prepared for them. Yours\r\n    in great haste, J.B. SMITH.\r\n\r\n    P.S.--Be sure and follow the directions given to Brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADAM BROOKS, alias William Smith. Hardtown, Montgomery county, Maryland,\r\nlost a rather promising \"article of merchandise,\" in the person of Adam.\r\nThe particulars of his going are on this wise: John Phillips, his\r\nso-called master, believed in selling, and practiced accordinglv, to the\r\nextent at least of selling Adam's mother, brother, and sister only two\r\nyears before his escape.\r\n\r\nIf Adam had known nothing else against Phillips, this was enough in all\r\nconscience to have awakened his deadly hate; but, added to this,\r\nPhillips was imprudent in his habit of threatening to \"sell,\" etc. This\r\nkept the old wound in Adam's heart continually bleeding and forced him\r\nto the conclusion, that his master was not only a hard man, as a driver\r\non the farm, but that at heart he was actually a bad man. Furthermore,\r\nthat it was his duty to break his fetters and seek his freedom in\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nIn thus looking at his situation, his mind was worked up to fever heat,\r\nand he resolved that, let the consequences be what they might, go he\r\nmust. In this promising state of mind he started, at an appointed time,\r\nfor Pennsylvania, and, sure enough, he succeeded. Having the appearance\r\nof a desirable working-hand, a Pennsylvania farmer prevailed on him to\r\nstop for a time. It was not long before the folly of this halt was\r\nplainly discernible, as his master had evidently got wind of his\r\nwhereabouts, and was pretty hot in pursuit. Word reached Adam, however,\r\nbarely in time for him to make his escape through the aid of friends.\r\n\r\nIn coming into the hands of the Committee he needed no persuading to go\r\nto Canada; he was occupied with two interesting problems, to go back or\r\nto go forward. But he set his face hopefully towards Canada, and had no\r\nthought of stopping short thereof. In stature, he was small; color,\r\nblack; countenance, pleasant, and intellect, medium. As to his fitness\r\nfor making a good citizen in Canada the Committee had no doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSARAH A. DUNAGAN. Having no one to care for her, and, having been\r\nthreatened with the auction-block, Sarah mustered pluck and started out\r\nin search of a new home among strangers beyond the borders of slave\r\nterritory. According to her story, she \"was born free\" in the State of\r\nDelaware, but had been \"bound out\" to a man by the name of George\r\nChurchman, living in Wilmington. Here she averred, that she \"had been\r\nflogged repeatedly,\" and had been otherwise ill-treated, while no one\r\ninterfered to take her part. Consequently she concluded, that although\r\nshe was born free, she would not be likely to be benefited thereby\r\nunless she made her escape on the Underground Rail Road. This idea of\r\nfreedom continued to agitate Sarah's mind until she decided to leave\r\nforthwith. She was a young mulatto woman, single, and told her story of\r\nhardships and of the dread of being sold, in a manner to elicit much\r\nsympathy. She had a mother living in New Castle, named Ann Eliza\r\nKingslow. It was no uncommon thing for free-born persons in slave States\r\nto lose their birth-right in a manner similar to that by which Sarah\r\nfeared that she had lost hers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Arrived JOSEPH HALL, JR., son of Joseph Hall, of Norfolk, Virginia.\"\r\nThis is all that is recorded of this passenger, yet it is possible that\r\nthis item of news may lead to the recognition of Joseph, should he still\r\nhappen to be of the large multitude of fugitives scattered over the land\r\namongst the living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISAAC D. DAVIS. In fleeing from bondage, in Maryland, Davis was induced\r\nto stop, as many others were, in Pennsylvania. Not comprehending the\r\nFugitive Slave Law he fancied that he would be safe so long as he kept\r\nmatters private concerning his origin. But in this particular he labored\r\nunder a complete delusion--when he least dreamed of danger the\r\nslave-catchers were scenting him close. Of their approach, however, he\r\nwas fortunate enough to be notified in time to place himself in the\r\nhands of the Committee, who soon held out Canada to him, as the only\r\nsure refuge for him, and all others similarly situated. His fears of\r\nbeing carried back opened his eyes, and understanding, so that he could\r\nreadily see the force of this argument, and accepting the proffered aid\r\nof the Committee was sent on his way rejoicing. He had been away from\r\nhis master eighteen months, and in the meanwhile had married a wife in\r\nPennsylvania. What became of them after this flight the book contains no\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJACOB MATTHIAS BOYER left at about the age of twenty. He had no idea of\r\nworking in the condition of a slave, but if he had not been threatened\r\nwith the auction-block, he might have remained much longer than he did.\r\nHe had been owned by Richard Carman, cashier of one of the Annapolis\r\nbanks, and who had recently died. Jacob fled from Annapolis. Very little\r\nrecord was made of either master or slave. Probably no incidents were\r\nrelated of sufficient importance, still the Committee felt pleased to\r\nreceive one so young. Indeed, it always afforded the Committee especial\r\nsatisfaction to see children, young people, and females escaping from\r\nthe prison-house. Jacob was of a dark hue, a little below medium\r\nstature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZECHARIAH MEAD, alias John Williams. This traveler had been in the house\r\nof bondage in Maryland, doing service for Charles C. Owens, to whom he\r\nbelonged. According to Zechariah's statement, his mistress had been very\r\nunfortunate with her slave property, having lost fifteen head out of\r\ntwenty in a similar manner to that by which she lost Zechariah. Thus she\r\nhad been considerably reduced in circumstances. But Zechariah had no\r\ncompassion on her whatever, but insisted that she was a hard mistress.\r\nDoubtless Zechariah was prompted to flee by the \"bad\" example of others\r\nwho had succeeded in making good their escape, before he had made up his\r\nmind to leave. He was not yet quite twenty-one, but was wide-awake, and\r\nit appeared from his conversation, that he had done some close thinking\r\nbefore he started for freedom. He left his father, mother, and three\r\nbrothers, all slaves except his father.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLAVE-HOLDER IN MARYLAND WITH THREE COLORED WIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES GRIFFIN ALIAS THOMAS BROWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nJames was a tiller of the soil under the yoke of Joshua Hitch, who lived\r\non a farm about seventeen miles from Baltimore. James spoke rather\r\nfavorably of him; indeed, it was through a direct act of kindness on the\r\npart of his master that he procured the opportunity to make good his\r\nescape. It appeared from his story, that his master's affairs had become\r\nparticularly embarrassed, and the Sheriff was making frequent visits to\r\nhis house. This sign was interpreted to mean that James, if not others,\r\nwould have to be sold before long. The master was much puzzled to decide\r\nwhich way to turn. He owned but three other adult slaves besides James,\r\nand they were females. One of them was his chief housekeeper, and with\r\nthem all his social relations were of such a nature as to lead James and\r\nothers to think and say that they \"were all his wives.\" Or to use\r\nJames's own language, \"he had three slave women; two were sisters, and\r\nhe lived with them all as his wives; two of them he was very fond of,\"\r\nand desired to keep them from being sold if possible. The third, he\r\nconcluded he could not save, she would have to be sold. In this dilemma,\r\nhe was good enough to allow James a few days' holiday, for the purpose\r\nof finding him a good master. Expressing his satisfaction and\r\ngratification, James, armed with full authority from his master to\r\nselect a choice specimen, started for Baltimore.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Baltimore, however, James carefully steered clear of all\r\nslave-holders, and shrewdly turned his attention to the matter of\r\ngetting an Underground Rail Road ticket for Canada. After making as much\r\ninquiry as he felt was safe, he came to the conclusion to walk of nights\r\nfor a long distance. He examined his feet and legs, found that they were\r\nin good order, and his faith and hope strong enough to remove a\r\nmountain. Besides several days still remained in which he was permitted\r\nto look for a new master, and these he decided could be profitably spent\r\nin making his way towards Canada. So off he started, at no doubt a very\r\ndiligent pace, for at the end of the first night's journey, he had made\r\nmuch headway, but at the expense of his feet.\r\n\r\nHis faith was stronger than ever. So he rested next day in the woods,\r\nconcealed, of course, and the next evening started with fresh courage\r\nand renewed perseverance. Finally, he reached Columbia, Pennsylvania,\r\nand there he had the happiness to learn, that the mountain which at\r\nfirst had tried his faith so severely, was removed, and friendly hands\r\nwere reached out and a more speedy and comfortable mode of travel\r\nadvised. He was directed to the Vigilance Committee in Philadelphia,\r\nfrom whom he received friendly aid, and all necessary information\r\nrespecting Canada and how to get there.\r\n\r\nJames was thirty-one years of age, rather a fine-looking man, of a\r\nchestnut color, and quite intelligent. He had been a married man, but\r\nfor two years before his escape, he had been a widower--that is, his\r\nwife had been sold away from him to North Carolina, and in that space of\r\ntime he had received only three letters from her; he had given up all\r\nhope of ever seeing her again. He had two little boys living in\r\nBaltimore, whom he was obliged to leave. Their names were Edward and\r\nWilliam. What became of them afterwards was never known at the\r\nPhiladelphia station.\r\n\r\nJames's master was a man of about fifty years of age--who had never been\r\nlawfully married, yet had a number of children on his place who were of\r\ngreat concern to him in the midst of other pressing embarrassments. Of\r\ncourse, the Committee never learned how matters were settled after James\r\nleft, but, in all probability, his wives, Nancy and Mary (sisters), and\r\nLizzie, with all the children, had to be sold.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN F. ARRIVES WITH NINE PASSENGERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAMES OF PASSENGERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPETER HEINES, Eatontown, North Carolina; MATTHEW BODAMS, Plymouth, North\r\nCarolina; JAMES MORRIS, South End, North Carolina; CHARLES THOMPSON,\r\nCHARITY THOMPSON, NATHANIEL BOWSER, and THOMAS COOPER, Portsmouth,\r\nVirginia; GEORGE ANDERSON, Elkton, Maryland.\r\n\r\nTheir arrival was announced by Thomas Garrett as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILMINGTON, 7th mo., 19th, 1856.\r\n\r\n    RESPECTED FRIEND, WILLIAM STILL:--I now have the pleasure of\r\n    consigning to thy care four able-bodied human beings from North\r\n    Carolina, and five from Virginia, one of which is a girl twelve\r\n    or thirteen years of age, the rest all men. After thee has seen\r\n    and conversed with them, thee can determine what is best to be\r\n    done with them. I am assured they are such as can take good care\r\n    of themselves. Elijah Pennypacker, some time since, informed me\r\n    he could find employment in his neighborhood for two or three\r\n    good hands. I should think that those from Carolina would be\r\n    about as safe in that neighborhood as any place this side of\r\n    Canada. Wishing our friends a safe trip, I remain thy sincere\r\n    friend,\r\n\r\n    THOS. GARRETT.\r\n\r\n    After conferring with Harry Craige, we have concluded to send\r\n    five or six of them tonight in the cars, and the balance, if\r\n    those go safe, to-morrow night, or in the steam-boat on Second\r\n    day morning, directed to the Anti-Slavery office.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was much rejoicing over these select passengers, and very much\r\ninteresting information was elicited from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter was only twenty-one years of age, composed of equal parts of\r\nAnglo-Saxon and Anglo-African blood--rather a model-looking \"article,\"\r\nwith a fair share of intelligence. As a slave, he had fared pretty\r\nwell--he had neither been abused nor stinted of food or clothing, as\r\nmany others had been. His duties had been to attend upon his master (and\r\nreputed father), Elias Heines, Esq., a lawyer by profession in North\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\nNo charges whatever appear to have been made against Mr. Heines,\r\naccording to the record book; but Peter seemed filled with great delight\r\nat the prospects ahead, as well as with the success that had attended\r\nhis efforts thus far in striking for freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames was twenty-seven years of age. His experience had been quite\r\ndifferent from that of Peter's. The heel of a woman, by the name of Mrs.\r\nAnn McCourt, had been on James's neck, and she had caused him to suffer\r\nseverely. As James recounted his grievances, while under the rule, he by\r\nno means gave her a very flattering character, but, on the contrary, he\r\nplainly stated, that she was a \"desperate woman\"--that he had \"never\r\nknown any good of her,\" and that he was moved to escape to get rid of\r\nher. In other words she had threatened to sell him; this well nigh\r\nproduced frenzy in James's mind, for too well did he remember, that he\r\nhad already been sold three times, and in different stages of his\r\nbondage had been treated quite cruelly. In the change of masters he was\r\npositive in saying, that he had not found a good one, and, besides, he\r\nentertained the belief that such personages were very rare.\r\n\r\nThose of the Committee who listened to James were not a little amazed at\r\nhis fluency, intelligence and earnestness, and acknowledged that he\r\ndealt unusually telling blows against the Patriarchal Institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew was twenty-three years of age, very stout--no fool--a man of\r\ndecided resolution, and of the very best black complexion produced in\r\nthe South. Matthew had a very serious bill of complaints against Samuel\r\nSimmons, who professed to own him (Matthew), both body and mind, while\r\nin this world at least. Among these complaints was the charge of\r\nill-treatment. Nevertheless Matthew's joy and pleasure were matchless\r\nover his Underground Rail Road triumph, and the prospect of being so\r\nsoon out of the land and reach of Slavery, and in a land where he could\r\nenjoy his freedom as others enjoyed theirs. Indeed the entire band\r\nevinced similar feelings. Matthew left a brother in Martin county.\r\n\r\nFurther sketches of this interesting company were not entered on the\r\nbook at the time, perhaps on account of the great press of Underground\r\nRail Road business which engaged the attention of the acting Committee.\r\nHowever, they were all duly cared for, and counselled to go to Canada,\r\nwhere their rights would be protected by a strong and powerful\r\ngovernment, and they could enjoy all the rights of citizenship in common\r\nwith \"all the world and the rest of mankind.\" And especially were they\r\nadvised to get education; to act as men, and remember those still in\r\nbonds as bound with them, and that they must not forget to write back,\r\nafter their arrival in Canada, to inform their friends in Philadelphia\r\nof their prospects, and what they thought of the \"goodly land.\" Thus,\r\nwith the usual Underground Rail Road passports, they were again started\r\nCanada-ward. Without difficulty of any kind they duly reached Canada,\r\nand a portion of them wrote back as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"TORONTO, C.W., Aug. 17th, 1856.\r\n\r\n    MR, STILL:--Dear Sir--These few lines may find you as they leave\r\n    us, we are well at present and arrived safe in Toronto. Give our\r\n    respects to Mrs. S.---- and daughter. Toronto is a very\r\n    extensive place. We have plenty of pork, beef and mutton. There\r\n    are five market houses and many churches. Female wages is 62-1/2\r\n    cents per day, men's wages is $1 and york shilling. We are now\r\n    boarding at Mr. George Blunt's, on Centre street, two doors from\r\n    Elm, back of Lawyer's Hall, and when you write to us, direct\r\n    your letter to the care of Mr. George Blunt, &c. (Signed), James\r\n    Monroe, Peter Heines, Henry James Morris, and Matthew Bodame.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis intelligence was very gratifying, and most assuredly added to the\r\npleasurable contemplation of having the privilege of holding out a\r\nhelping hand to the fleeing bondman. From James Morris, one of this\r\ncompany, however, letters of a painful nature were received, touching\r\nhis wife in bonds, setting forth her \"awful\" situation and appealing to\r\nthe Committee to use their best endeavors to rescue her, with her child,\r\nfrom Slavery. One of these letters, so full of touching sentiments of\r\naffection and appeal on behalf of his wife, is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    TORONTO, Canada West, upper, 18th day of the 9th mo., 1856.\r\n\r\n    MR. WILLIAM STILL:--Dear Sir--I hope these lines may find you\r\n    and your family as they leave me give my respects to little\r\n    Caroline and her mother.\r\n\r\n    Dear Sir, I have received two letters from my wife since I saw\r\n    you, and the second was awful. I am sorry to say she says she\r\n    has been treated awful since I left, and she told the lady she\r\n    thought she was left free and she told her she was as much slave\r\n    as ever she was that the state was not to be settled until her\r\n    death and it would be a meracle if she and her child got it then\r\n    and that her master left a great many relations and she diden no\r\n    what they would do. Mr. Still dear sir I am very sorry to hear\r\n    my wife and child are slaves if you please dear sir inform me\r\n    what to do for my dear wife and child. She said she has been\r\n    threatened to be put in jail three times since I left also she\r\n    tells me that she is washing for the captain of a vesel that use\r\n    to run to Petersburg but now he runs to Baltimore and he has\r\n    promas to take her to Delaware or New York for 50 dollars and\r\n    she had not the money, she sent to me and I sent her all I had\r\n    which was 5 dollars dear sir can you inform me what to do with a\r\n    case of this kind the captains name is Thomas.\r\n\r\n    My wife is name lucy an morris my child is name lot, if you\r\n    please dear sir answer me as soon as you can posable.\r\n\r\n    HENRY JAMES MORRIS, Toronto C.W.\r\n\r\n    Henry James Morris in care of Wm. George Blunt, Centre st., 2\r\n    doors from Elam.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis sad letter made a mournful impression, as it was not easy to see\r\nhow her deliverance was to be effected. One feature, however, about this\r\nepistle afforded much satisfaction, namely, to know, that James did not\r\nforget his poor wife and child, who were in the prison-house. Many\r\nmonths after this first letter came to hand, Mrs. Dr. Willis, one of the\r\nfirst ladies in Toronto, wrote on his behalf as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    TORONTO, 15th June, Monday morning, 1857.\r\n\r\n    To MR. STILL, DEAR SIR:--I write you this letter for a\r\n    respectable young man (his name is James Morris), he passed\r\n    through your hands July of last year (1856), and has just had a\r\n    letter from his wife, whom he left behind in Virginia, that she\r\n    and her child are likely to be sold. He is very anxious about\r\n    this and wishful that she could get away by some vessel or\r\n    otherwise. His wife's name is Lucy Morris; the child's name is\r\n    Lot Morris; the lady's name she lives with is a Mrs. Hine (I\r\n    hope I spell her name right, Hine), at the corner of Duke street\r\n    and Washington street, in Norfolk city, Virginia. She is hired\r\n    out to this rich old widow lady. James Morris wishes me to write\r\n    you--he has saved forty dollars, and will send it to you\r\n    whenever it is required, to bring her on to Toronto, Canada\r\n    West. It is in the bank ready upon call. Will you please, sir,\r\n    direct your letter in reply to this, to a Mrs. Ringgold, Centre\r\n    street, two doors from Elam street, Toronto, Canada West, as I\r\n    will be out of town. I write this instead of Mr. Thomas Henning,\r\n    who is just about leaving for England. Hoping you will reply\r\n    soon, I remain, sir,\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n    AGNES WILLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether James ever succeeded in recovering his wife and child, is not\r\nknown to the writer. Many similarly situated were wont to appeal again\r\nand again, until growing entirely hopeless, they would conclude to\r\nmarry.\r\n\r\nHere it may be remarked, with reference to marrying, that of the great\r\nnumber of fugitives in Canada, the male sex was largely in preponderance\r\nover the female, and many of them were single young men. This class\r\nfound themselves very acceptable to Irish girls, and frequently legal\r\nalliances were the result. And it is more than likely, that there are\r\nwhite women in Canada to-day, who are married to some poor slave woman's\r\nfugitive husband.\r\n\r\nVerily, the romantic and tragic phases of the Underground Rail Road are\r\nwithout number, if not past finding out.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the above-mentioned nine left the Philadelphia depot, ere\r\nthe following way-worn travelers came to hand:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERRY SHEPHARD, and ISAAC REED, Eastern Shore, Maryland; GEORGE\r\nSPERRYMAN, _alias_ THOMAS JOHNSON, Richmond; VALENTINE SPIRES, near\r\nPetersburg; DANIEL GREEN, _alias_ GEORGE TAYLOR, Leesburg, Virginia;\r\nJAMES JOHNSON, _alias_ WILLIAM GILBERT and wife HARRIET, Prince George's\r\ncounty, Maryland; HENRY COOPER, and WILLIAM ISRAEL SMITH, Middletown,\r\nDelaware; ANNA DORSEY, Maryland.\r\n\r\nAlthough starting from widely separated localities without the slightest\r\ncommunication with each other in the South, each separate passenger\r\nearnestly bent on freedom, had endured suffering, hunger, and perils, by\r\nland and water, sustained by the hope of ultimate freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERRY SHEPHARD and ISAAC REED reported themselves as having fled from\r\nthe Eastern Shore of Maryland; that they had there been held to service\r\nor Slavery by Sarah Ann Burgess, and Benjamin Franklin Houston, from\r\nwhom they fled. No incidents of slave life or travel were recorded, save\r\nthat Perry left his wife Milky Ann, and two children, Nancy and Rebecca\r\n(free). Also Isaac left his wife, Hester Ann Louisa, and the following\r\nnamed children: Philip Henry, Harriet Ann and Jane Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE SPERRYMAN'S lot was cast amongst the oppressed in the city of\r\nRichmond, Va. Of the common ills of slave life, George could speak from\r\nexperience; but little of his story, however, was recorded at the time.\r\nHe had reached the Committee through the regular channel--was adjudged\r\nworthy of aid and encouragement, and they gave it to him freely.\r\nNickless Templeman was the loser in this instance; how he bore the\r\nmisfortune the Committee was not apprised. Without question, the\r\nproperty was delighted with getting rid of the owner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVALENTINE SPIRES came a fellow-passenger with George, having \"took out\"\r\nthe previous Christmas, from a place called Dunwoody, near Petersburg.\r\nHe was held to service in that place by Dr. Jesse Squires. Under his\r\noppressive rules and demands, Valentine had been convinced that there\r\ncould be no peace, consequently he turned his attention to one\r\nidea--freedom and the Underground Rail Road, and with this faith, worked\r\nhis way through to the Committee, and was received, and aided of course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVID GREEN, fled from Warrington, near Leesburg. Elliott Curlett so\r\nalarmed David by threatening to sell him, that the idea of liberty\r\nimmediately took possession in David's mind. David had suffered many\r\nhardships at the hands of his master, but when the auction-block was\r\nheld up to him, that was the worst cut of all. He became a thinker right\r\naway. Although he had a wife and one child in Slavery, he decided to\r\nflee for his freedom at all hazards, and accordingly he carried out his\r\nfirm resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES JOHNSON. This \"article\" was doing unrequited labor as the slave of\r\nThomas Wallace, in Prince George county, Maryland. He was a stout and\r\nrugged-looking man, of thirty-five years of age. On escaping, he was\r\nfortunate enough to bring his wife, Harriet with him. She was ten years\r\nyounger than himself, and had been owned by William T. Wood, by whom she\r\nsaid that she had \"been well treated.\" But of late, this Wood had taken\r\nto liquor, and she felt in danger of being sold. She knew that rum\r\nruined the best of slave-holders, so she was admonished to get out of\r\ndanger as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES HENRY COOPER and WILLIAM ISRAEL SMITH. These passengers were\r\nrepresentatives of the peculiar Institution of Middletown, Delaware.\r\nCharles was owned by Catharine Mendine, and William by John P. Cather.\r\nAccording to their confession, Charles and William it seemed had been\r\nthinking a good deal over the idea of \"working for nothing,\" of being\r\ndaily driven to support others, while they were rendered miserable\r\nthereby. So they made up their minds to try the Underground Rail Road,\r\n\"hit or miss.\" This resolution was made and carried into effect (on the\r\npart of Charles at least), at the cost of leaving a mother, three\r\nbrothers, and three sisters in Slavery, without hope of ever seeing them\r\nagain. The ages of Charles and William were respectively twenty-two and\r\ntwenty-one. Both stout and well-made young men, with intellects well\r\nqualified to make the wilderness of Canada bud and blossom as the rose,\r\nand thitherward they were dispatched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNA DORSET became tired of Slavery in Maryland, where she reported that\r\nshe had been held to service by a slave-holder, known by the name of Eli\r\nMolesworth. The record is silent as to how she was treated. As a slave,\r\nshe had been brought up a seamstress, and was quite intelligent. Age\r\ntwenty-two, mulatto.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOWEN AND OTHO TAYLOR'S FLIGHT WITH HORSES, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE BROTHERS, TWO OF THEM WITH WIVES AND CHILDREN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the latter part of March, 1856, Owen Taylor and his wife, Mary\r\nAnn, and their little son, Edward, together with a brother and his wife\r\nand two children, and a third brother, Benjamin, arrived from near Clear\r\nSprings, nine miles from Hagerstown, Maryland. They all left their home,\r\nor rather escaped from the prison-house, on Easter Sunday, and came\r\n_viâ_ Harrisburg, where they were assisted and directed to the Vigilance\r\nCommittee in Philadelphia. A more interesting party had not reached the\r\nCommittee for a long time.\r\n\r\nThe three brothers were intelligent, and heroic, and, in the resolve to\r\nobtain freedom, not only for themselves, but for their wives and\r\nchildren desperately in earnest. They had counted well the cost of this\r\nstruggle for liberty, and had fully made up their minds that if\r\ninterfered with by slave-catchers, somebody would have to bite the dust.\r\nThat they had pledged themselves never to surrender alive, was obvious.\r\nTheir travel-worn appearance, their attachment for each other, the joy\r\nthat the tokens of friendship afforded them, the description they gave\r\nof incidents on the road, made an impression not soon to be effaced.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of a group like this Sumner's great and eloquent speech\r\non the Barbarism of Slavery, seemed almost cold and dead,--the mute\r\nappeals of these little ones in their mother's arms--the unlettered\r\nlanguage of these young mothers, striving to save their offspring from\r\nthe doom of Slavery--the resolute and manly bearing of these brothers\r\nexpressed in words full of love of liberty, and of the determination to\r\nresist Slavery to the death, in defence of their wives and\r\nchildren--this was Sumner's speech enacted before our eyes.\r\n\r\nOwen was about thirty-one years of age, but had experienced a deal of\r\ntrouble. He had been married twice, and both wives were believed to be\r\nliving. The first one, with their little child, had been sold in the\r\nBaltimore market, about three years before, the mother was sent to\r\nLouisiana, the child to South Carolina. Father, mother, and child,\r\nparted with no hope of ever seeing each other again in this world. After\r\nOwen's wife was sent South, he sent her his likeness and a dress; the\r\nlatter was received, and she was greatly delighted with it, but he never\r\nheard of her having received his likeness. He likewise wrote to her, but\r\nhe was not sure that she received his letters. Finally, he came to the\r\nconclusion that as she was forever dead to him, he would do well to\r\nmarry again. Accordingly he took to himself another partner, the one who\r\nnow accompanied him on the Underground Rail Road.\r\n\r\nOmitting other interesting incidents, a reference to his handiwork will\r\nsuffice to show the ability of Owen. Owen was a born mechanic, and his\r\nmaster practically tested his skill in various ways; sometimes in the\r\nblacksmith shop--at other times as a wheelwright--again at making\r\nbrushes and brooms, and at leisure times he would try his hand in all\r\nthese crafts. This Jack-of-all-trades was, of course, very valuable to\r\nhis master. Indeed his place was hard to fill.\r\n\r\nHenry Fiery, a farmer, \"about sixty-four years of age, a stout, crusty\r\nold fellow,\" was the owner of Owen and his two brothers. Besides slaves,\r\nthe old man was in possession of a wife, whose name was Martha, and\r\nseven children, who were pretty well grown up. One of the sons owned\r\nOwen's wife and two children. Owen declared, that they had been worked\r\nhard, while few privileges had been allowed them. Clothing of the\r\npoorest texture was only sparingly furnished. Nothing like Sunday\r\nraiment was ever given them; for these comforts they were compelled to\r\ndo over-work of nights. For a long time the idea of escape had been\r\nuppermost in the minds of this party. The first of January, past, was\r\nthe time \"solemnly\" fixed upon to \"took out,\" but for some reason or\r\nother (not found on the record book), their strategical minds did not\r\nsee the way altogether clear, and they deferred starting until Easter\r\nSunday.\r\n\r\nOn that memorable evening, the men boldly harnessed two of Mr. Fiery's\r\nsteeds and placing their wives and children in the carriage, started off\r\n_viâ_ Hagerstown, in a direct line for Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, at a\r\nrate that allowed no grass to grow under the horses' feet. In this\r\nmanner they made good time, reached Chambersburg safely, and ventured up\r\nto a hotel where they put up their horses. Here they bade their faithful\r\nbeasts good-bye and \"took out\" for Harrisburg by another mode of travel,\r\nthe cars. On their arrival they naturally fell into the hands of the\r\nCommittee, who hurried them off to Philadelphia, apprising the Committee\r\nthere of their approach by a dispatch sent ahead. Probably they had\r\nscarcely reached Philadelphia ere the Fierys were in hot haste after\r\nthem, as far as Harrisburg, if not farther.\r\n\r\nIt hardly need be hinted, that the community in which the Fierys lived\r\nwas deeply agitated for days after, as indeed it was along the entire\r\nroute to Chambersburg, in consequence of this bold and successful\r\nmovement. The horses were easily captured at the hotel, where they were\r\nleft, but, of course, they were mute as to what had become of their\r\ndrivers. The furious Fierys probably got wind of the fact, that they had\r\nmade their way to Harrisburg. At any rate they made very diligent search\r\nat this point. While here prosecuting his hunting operations, Fiery\r\nmanaged to open communication with at least one member of the Harrisburg\r\nCommittee, to whom his grievances were made known, but derived little\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nAfter the experience of a few weeks, the pursuers came to the\r\nconclusion, that there was no likelihood of recovering them through\r\nthese agencies, or through the Fugitive Slave Law. In their despair,\r\ntherefore, they resorted to another \"dodge.\" All at once they became\r\n\"sort-o'-friendly\"--indeed more than half disposed to emancipate. The\r\nmember of the Committee in Harrisburg had, it is probable, frequently\r\nleft room for their great delusion, if he did not even go so far as to\r\nfeed their hopes with plausible suggestions, that some assistance might\r\nbe afforded by which an amicable settlement might be made between\r\nmasters and slaves.\r\n\r\nThe following extract, from the Committee's letter, relative to this\r\nmatter, is open to this inference, and may serve to throw some light on\r\nthe subject:\r\n\r\n\r\n    HARRISBURG, April 28, '56.\r\n\r\n    Friend Still:--Your last came to hand in due season, and I am\r\n    happy to hear of the safe arrival of those gents.\r\n\r\n    I have before me the Power of Attorney of Mr. John S. Fiery, son\r\n    of Mr. Henry Fiery, of Washington county, Md., the owner of\r\n    those three men, two women and three children, who arrived in\r\n    your town on the 24th or 25th of March. He graciously\r\n    condescends to liberate the oldest in a year, and the remainder\r\n    in proportional time, if they will come back; or to sell them\r\n    their time for $1300. He is sick of the job, and is ready to\r\n    make any conditions. Now, if you personally can get word to them\r\n    and get them to send him a letter, in my charge, informing him\r\n    of their whereabouts and prospects, I think it will be the best\r\n    answer I can make him. He will return here in a week or two, to\r\n    know what can be done. He offers $500 to see them.\r\n\r\n    Or if you can send me word where they are, I will endeavor to\r\n    write to them for his special satisfaction; or if you cannot do\r\n    either, send me your latest information, for I intend to make\r\n    him spend a few more dollars, and if possible get a little\r\n    sicker of this bad job. Do try and send him a few bitter pills\r\n    for his weak nerves and disturbed mind.\r\n\r\n    Yours in great haste,\r\n\r\n    Jos. C. Bustill.\r\n\r\n\r\nA subsequent letter from Mr. Bustill contains, besides other interesting\r\nUnderground Rail Road matter, an item relative to the feeling of\r\ndisappointment experienced by Mr. Fiery on learning that his property\r\nwas in Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HARRISBURG, May 26, '56.\r\n\r\n    Friend Still:--I embrace the opportunity presented by the visit\r\n    of our friend, John F. Williams, to drop you a few lines in\r\n    relation to our future operations.\r\n\r\n    The Lightning Train was put on the Road on last Monday, and as\r\n    the traveling season has commenced and this is the Southern\r\n    route for Niagara Falls, I have concluded not to send by way of\r\n    Auburn, except in cases of great danger; but hereafter we will\r\n    use the Lightning Train, which leaves here at 1-1/2 and arrives\r\n    in your city at 5 o'clock in the morning, and I will telegraph\r\n    about 5-1/2 o'clock in the afternoon, so it may reach you before\r\n    you close. These four are the only ones that have come since my\r\n    last. The woman has been here some time waiting for her child\r\n    and her beau, which she expects here about the first of June. If\r\n    possible, please keep a knowledge of her whereabouts, to enable\r\n    me to inform him if he comes.\r\n\r\n    _I have nothing more to send you, except that John Fiery has\r\n    visited us again and much to his chagrin received the\r\n    information of their being in Canada_.\r\n\r\n    Yours as ever,\r\n\r\n    Jos. C. Bustill.\r\n\r\n    Whilst the Fierys were working like beavers to re-enslave these\r\n    brave fugitives, the latter were daily drinking in more and more\r\n    of the spirit of freedom and were busy with schemes for the\r\n    deliverance of other near kin left behind under the galling\r\n    yoke.\r\n\r\n    Several very interesting letters were received from Otho Taylor,\r\n    relative to a raid he designed making expressly to effect the\r\n    escape of his family. The two subjoined must suffice, (others,\r\n    much longer, cannot now be produced, they have probably been\r\n    loaned and not returned.)\r\n\r\n\r\n        APRIL 15th, 1857.\r\n\r\n        SIR--We arrived here safely. Mr. Syrus and his lady is\r\n        well situated. They have a place for the year round 15\r\n        dollars per month. We are all well and hope that you are\r\n        all the same. Now I wish to know whether you would\r\n        please to send me some money to go after those people.\r\n        Send it here if you please.\r\n\r\n        Yours truly,\r\n\r\n        OTHO TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n        WILLIAM STILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ST. CATHARINES, Jan. 26, 1857.\r\n\r\n    MR. WM. STILL:--Dear Sir--I write at this time in behalf of Otho\r\n    Taylor. He is very anxious to go and get his family at Clear\r\n    Spring, Washington county, Md. He would like to know if the\r\n    Society there would furnish him the means to go after them from\r\n    Philadelphia, that you will be running no risk in doing this. If\r\n    the Society can do this, he would not be absent from P. more\r\n    than three days.\r\n\r\n    He is so anxious to get his family from slavery that he is\r\n    willing to do almost anything to get them to Canada. You may\r\n    possibly recollect him--he was at your place last August. I\r\n    think he can be trusted. If you can do something for him, he has\r\n    the means to take him to your place.\r\n\r\n    Please let me know immediately if you can do this.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n    M.A.H. WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch appeals came very frequently from Canada, causing much sadness, as\r\nbut little encouragement could be held out to such projects. In the\r\nfirst place, the danger attendant upon such expeditions was so fearful,\r\nand in the second place, our funds were so inadequate for this kind of\r\nwork, that, in most cases, such appeals had to be refused. Of course,\r\nthere were those whose continual coming, like the poor widow in the\r\nGospel, could not be denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAVY REWARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD.--Ran away from the subscriber,\r\n    residing near Bladensburg, Prince George's county, Maryland, on\r\n    Saturday night, the 22d of March, 1856, my negro man, Tom\r\n    Matthews, aged about 25 years, about 5 feet 9 or 10 inches high,\r\n    dark copper color, full suit of bushy hair, broad face, with\r\n    high cheek bones, broad and square shoulders, stands and walks\r\n    very erect, though quite a sluggard in action, except in a\r\n    dance, at which he is hard to beat. He wore away a black coat\r\n    and brown pantaloons. I will give the above reward if taken and\r\n    brought home, or secured in jail, so that I get him.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    E.A. JONES, near Bladensburg, Md.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Jones may be unaware which way his man Tom traveled, this item\r\nmay inform him that his name was entered on the Underground Rail Road\r\nbook April 4th, 1856, at which date he appeared to be in good health and\r\nfull of hope for a safe sojourn in Canada. He was destitute, of course,\r\njust as anybody else would have been, if robbers had stripped him of\r\nevery dollar of his earnings; but he felt pretty sure, that he could\r\ntake care of himself in her Majesty's dominion.\r\n\r\nThe Committee, encouraged by his efforts, reached him a helping hand and\r\nsent him on to swell the goodly number in the promised land--Canada.\r\n\r\nOn the same day that Tom arrived, the Committee had the pleasure of\r\ntaking JAMES JONES by the hand. He was owned by Dr. William Stewart, of\r\nKing George's Court House, Maryland. He was not, however, in the service\r\nof his master at the time of his escape but was hired out in Alexandria.\r\nFor some reason, not noticed in the book, James became dissatisfied,\r\nchanged his name to Henry Rider, got an Underground Rail Road pass and\r\nleft the Dr. and his other associations in Maryland. He was one of the\r\nwell-cared for \"articles,\" and was of very near kin to the white people,\r\nat least a half-brother (mulatto, of course). He was thirty-two years of\r\nage, medium size, hard-featured and raw-boned, but \"no marks about him.\"\r\n\r\nJames looked as if he had had pretty good health, still the Committee\r\nthought that he would have much better in Canada. After hearing a full\r\ndescription of that country and of the great number of fugitives there\r\nfrom Maryland and other parts of the South, \"Jim\" felt that that was\r\njust the place he wanted to find, and was soon off with a free ticket, a\r\nletter of introduction, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN F. ARRIVES WITH FOURTEEN \"PRIME ARTICLES\" ON BOARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Garrett announced this in the following letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILMINGTON, 3d mo., 23d, 1856.\r\n\r\n    DEAR FRIEND, WILLIAM STILL:--Captain Fountain has arrived all\r\n    safe, with the human cargo thee was inquiring for, a few days\r\n    since. I had men waiting till 12 o'clock till the Captain\r\n    arrived at his berth, ready to receive them; last night they\r\n    then learned, that he had landed them at the Rocks, near the old\r\n    Swedes church, in the care of our efficient Pilot, who is in the\r\n    employ of my friend, John Hillis, and he has them now in charge.\r\n    As soon as my breakfast is over, I will see Hillis and determine\r\n    what is best to be done in their case. My own opinion is, we had\r\n    better send them to Hook and there put them in the cars to-night\r\n    and send a pilot to take them to thy house. As Marcus Hook is in\r\n    Pennsylvania, the agent of the cars runs no risk of the fine of\r\n    five hundred dollars our State imposes for assisting one of\r\n    God's poor out of the State by steamboat or cars.\r\n\r\n    As ever thy friend,\r\n\r\n    THOS. GAREETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAMES OF THE \"ARTICLES.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRebecca Jones, and her three daughters, Sarah Frances, Mary, and\r\nRebecca; Isaiah Robinson, Arthur Spence, Caroline Taylor, and her two\r\ndaughters, Nancy, and Mary; Daniel Robinson; Thomas Page; Benjamin\r\nDickinson; David Cole and wife.\r\n\r\nFrom the tenor of Thomas Garrett's letter, the Committee was prepared\r\nfor a joyful reception, knowing that Captain F. was not in the habit of\r\ndoing things by the halves--that he was not in the habit of bringing\r\nnumbskulls; indeed he brought none but the bravest and most intelligent.\r\nYet notwithstanding our knowledge of his practice in this respect, when\r\nhe arrived we were surprised beyond measure. The women outnumbered the\r\nmen. The two young mothers, with their interesting, hearty and\r\nfine-looking children representing in blood the two races about\r\nequally--presented a very impressive spectacle.\r\n\r\nThe men had the appearance of being active, smart, and well disposed,\r\nmuch above the generality of slaves; but, compared with those of the\r\nopposite sex, their claims for sympathy were very faint indeed. No one\r\ncould possibly avoid the conclusion, that these mothers, with their\r\nhandsome daughters, were valued on the Ledger of their owners at\r\nenormously high prices; that lustful traders and sensualists had already\r\ngloated over the thought of buying them in a few short years. Probably\r\nnot one of those beautiful girls would have brought less than fifteen\r\nhundred or two thousand dollars at the age of fifteen. It was therefore\r\na great satisfaction to think, that their mothers, who knew full well to\r\nwhat a fate such slave girls were destined, had labored so heroically to\r\nsnatch them out of this danger ere the critical hour arrived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRebecca Jones was about twenty-eight years of age; mulatto,\r\ngood-looking, considerably above medium size, very intelligent, and a\r\ntrue-born heroine.\r\n\r\nThe following reward, offered by the notorious negro-trader, Hall,\r\nproved that Rebecca and her children were not to be allowed to go free,\r\nif slave-hunters could be induced by a heavy pecuniary consideration to\r\nrecapture them:\r\n\r\n\r\n    $300 REWARD is offered for the apprehension of negro woman,\r\n    REBECCA JONES and her three children, and man ISAIAH, belonging\r\n    to W.W. Davidson, who have disappeared since the 20th inst. The\r\n    above reward will be paid for the apprehension and delivery of\r\n    the said Negroes to my Jail, by the attorney in fact of the\r\n    owner, or the sum of $250 for the man alone, or $150 for the\r\n    woman and three children alone.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    WM. W. HALL, for the Attorney, feb. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nYears before her escape, her mistress died in England; and as Rebecca\r\nhad always understood, long before this event, that all the slaves were\r\nto be freed at the death of her mistress, she was not prepared to\r\nbelieve any other report. It turned out, however, as in thousands of\r\nother instances, that no will could be found, and, of course, the\r\nadministrators retained the slave property, regardless of any verbal\r\nexpressions respecting freeing, etc. Rebecca closely watched the course\r\nof the administrators, and in the meanwhile firmly resolved, that\r\nneither she nor her children should ever serve another master. Rather\r\nthan submit, she declared that she would take the lives of her children\r\nand then her own. Notwithstanding her bold and decided stand, the report\r\nwent out that she was to be sold, and that all the slaves were still to\r\nbe held in bondage. Rebecca's sympathizers and friends advised her, as\r\nthey thought for the best, to get a friend or gentleman to purchase her\r\nfor herself. To this she replied: \"Not three cents would I give, nor do\r\nI want any of my friends to buy me, not if they could get me for three\r\ncents. It would be of no use,\" she contended, \"as she was fully bent on\r\ndying, rather than remain a slave.\" The slave-holders evidently\r\nunderstood her, and were in no hurry about bringing her case to an\r\nissue--they rather gave her time to become calm. But Rebecca was\r\ninflexible.\r\n\r\nSix years before her arrival, her husband had escaped, in company with\r\nthe noted fugitive, \"Shadrach.\" For a time after he fled, she frequently\r\nreceived letters from him, but for a long while he had ceased to write,\r\nand of late she had heard nothing from him.\r\n\r\nIn escaping stowed away in the boat, she suffered terribly, but\r\nfaithfully endured to the end, and was only too happy when the agony was\r\nover. After resting and getting thoroughly refreshed in Philadelphia,\r\nshe, with others, was forwarded to Boston, for her heart was there.\r\nSeveral letters were received from her, respecting her prospects, etc.,\r\nfrom which it appears that she had gained some knowledge of her husband,\r\nalthough not of a satisfactory nature. At any rate she decided that she\r\ncould not receive him back again. The following letter has reference to\r\nher prospects, going to California, her husband, etc.:\r\n\r\n\r\n    PARKER HOUSE, School street, Boston, Oct. 18th, '56.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SIR:--I can hardly express the pleasure I feel at the\r\n    receipt of your kind letter; but allow me to thank you for the\r\n    same.\r\n\r\n    And now I will tell you my reasons for going to California. Mrs.\r\n    Tarrol, a cousin of my husband, has sent for me. She says I can\r\n    do much better there than in Boston. And as I have my children's\r\n    welfare to look to, I have concluded to go. Of course I shall be\r\n    just as likely to hear from home _there_ as _here_. Please tell\r\n    Mr. Bagnale I shall expect one letter from him before I leave\r\n    here.\r\n\r\n    I should like to hear from my brothers and sisters once more,\r\n    and let me hear every particular. You never can know how anxious\r\n    I am to hear from them; do please impress this upon their minds.\r\n\r\n    I have written two letters to Dr. Lundy and never received an\r\n    answer. I heard Mrs. Lundy was dead, and thought that might\r\n    possibly be the reason he had not replied to me. Please tell the\r\n    Doctor I should take it as a great favor if he would write me a\r\n    few lines.\r\n\r\n    I suppose you think I am going to live with my husband again.\r\n    Let me assure you 'tis no such thing. My mind is as firm as\r\n    ever. And believe me, in going away from Boston, I am going away\r\n    from him, for I have heard he is living somewhere near. He has\r\n    been making inquiries about me, but that can make no difference\r\n    in my feelings to him. I hope that yourself, wife and family are\r\n    all quite well. Please remember me to them all. Do me the favor\r\n    to give my love to all inquiring friends. I should be most happy\r\n    to have any letters of introduction you may think me worthy of,\r\n    and I trust I shall ever remain\r\n\r\n    Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n    REBECCA JONES.\r\n\r\n    P.S.--I do not know if I shall go this Fall, or in the Spring.\r\n    It will depend upon the letter I receive from California, but\r\n    whichever it may be, I shall be happy to hear from you very\r\n    soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIsaiah, who was a fellow-servant with Rebecca, and was included in the\r\nreward offered by Hall for Rebecca, etc., was a young man about\r\ntwenty-three years of age, a mulatto, intelligent and of prepossessing\r\nmanners. A purely ardent thirst for liberty prompted him to flee;\r\nalthough he declared that he had been treated very badly, and had even\r\nsuffered severely from being shamefully \"beaten.\" He had, however, been\r\npermitted to hire his time by the year, for which one hundred and twenty\r\ndollars were regularly demanded by his owner. Young as he was, he was a\r\nmarried man, with a wife and two children, to whom he was devoted. He\r\nhad besides two brothers and two sisters for whom he felt a warm degree\r\nof brotherly affection; yet when the hour arrived for him to accept a\r\nchance for freedom at the apparent sacrifice of these dearest ties of\r\nkindred, he was found heroic enough for this painful ordeal, and to give\r\nup all for freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCaroline Taylor, and her two little children, were also from Norfolk,\r\nand came by boat. Upon the whole, they were not less interesting than\r\nRebecca Jones and her three little girls. Although Caroline was not in\r\nher person half so stately, nor gave such promise of heroism as\r\nRebecca--for Caroline was rather small of stature--yet she was more\r\nrefined, and quite as intelligent as Rebecca, and represented\r\nconsiderably more of the Anglo-Saxon blood. She was a mulatto, and her\r\nchildren were almost fair enough to pass for white--probably they were\r\nquadroons, hardly any one would have suspected that they had only one\r\nquarter of colored blood in their veins. For ten years Caroline had been\r\nin the habit of hiring her time at the rate of seventy-five dollars per\r\nyear, with the exception of the last year, when her hire was raised to\r\neighty-four dollars. So anxious was she to have her older girl (eleven\r\nyears old) at home with her, that she also hired her time by the year,\r\nfor which she was compelled to pay twenty-four dollars. As her younger\r\nchild was not sufficiently grown to hire out for pay, she was permitted\r\nto have it at home with her on the conditions that she would feed,\r\nclothe and take good care of it, permitting no expense whatever to fall\r\nupon the master.\r\n\r\nJudging from the appearance and manners of the children, their mother\r\nhad, doubtless, been most faithful to them, for more handsome,\r\nwell-behaved, intelligent and pleasing children could not easily be\r\nselected from either race or any station of life. The younger, Mary by\r\nname, nine years of age, attracted very great attention, by the deep\r\ninterest she manifested in a poor fugitive (whom she had never seen\r\nbefore), at the Philadelphia station, confined to the bed and suffering\r\nexcruciating pain from wounds he had received whilst escaping. Hours and\r\nhours together, during the two or three days of their sojourn, she spent\r\nof her own accord, by his bed-side, manifesting almost womanly sympathy\r\nin the most devoted and tender manner. She thus, doubtless,\r\nunconsciously imparted to the sufferer a great deal of comfort. Very\r\nmany affecting incidents had come under the observation of the acting\r\nCommittee, under various circumstances, but never before had they\r\nwitnessed a sight more interesting, a scene more touching.\r\n\r\nCaroline and her children were owned by Peter March, Esq., late of\r\nNorfolk, but at that time, he was living in New York, and was carrying\r\non the iron business. He came into possession of them through his wife,\r\nwho was the daughter of Caroline's former master, and almost the only\r\nheir left, in consequence of the terrible fever of the previous summer.\r\nCaroline was living under the daily fear of being sold; this, together\r\nwith the task of supporting herself and two children, made her burden\r\nvery grievous. Not a great while before her escape, her New York master\r\nhad been on to Norfolk, expressly with a view of selling her, and asked\r\ntwo thousand dollars for her. This, however, he failed to get, and was\r\nstill awaiting an offer.\r\n\r\nThese ill omens aroused Caroline to think more seriously over the\r\ncondition of herself and children than she had ever done before, and in\r\nthis state of mind she came to the conclusion, that she would strive to\r\nsave herself and children by flight on the Underground Rail Road. She\r\nknew full well, that it was no faint-hearted struggle that was required\r\nof her, so she had nerved herself with the old martyr spirit to risk her\r\nall on her faith in God and Freedom, and was ready to take the\r\nconsequences if she fell back into the hands of the enemy. This noble\r\ndecision was the crowning act in the undertakings of thousands similarly\r\nsituated. Through this faith she gained the liberty of herself and her\r\nchildren. Quite a number of the friends of the slave saw these\r\ninteresting fugitives, and wept, and rejoiced with them.\r\n\r\nCol. A. Cammings, in those days Publisher of the \"Evening Bulletin,\" for\r\nthe first time, witnessed an Underground Rail Road arrival. Some time\r\nprevious, in conversation with Mr. J.M. McKim, the Colonel had expressed\r\nviews not altogether favorable to the Underground Rail Road; indeed he\r\nwas rather inclined to apologize for slavery, if not to defend the\r\nFugitive Slave Law. While endeavoring somewhat tenaciously to maintain\r\nhis ground, Mr. McKim opposed to him not only the now well established\r\nAnti-Slavery doctrines, but also offered as testimony Underground Rail\r\nRoad facts--the results of personal knowledge from daily proofs of the\r\nheroic struggles, marvellous faith, and intense earnestness of the\r\nfugitives.\r\n\r\nIn all probability the Colonel did not feel prepared to deny wholly Mr.\r\nMcKim's statement, yet, he desired to see \"some\" for himself. \"Well,\"\r\nsaid Mr. McK., \"you shall see some.\" So when this arrival came to hand,\r\ntrue to his promise, Mr. McK. called on the Colonel and invited him to\r\naccompany him to the Underground Rail Road station. He assured the\r\nColonel that he did not want any money from him, but simply wanted to\r\nconvince him of his error in the recent argument that they had held on\r\nthe subject. Accordingly the Colonel accompanied him, and found that\r\ntwenty-two passengers had been on hand within the past twenty-four\r\nhours, and at least sixteen or seventeen were then in his presence. It\r\nis needless to say, that such a sight admitted of no contradiction--no\r\nargument--no doubt. The facts were too self-evident. The Colonel could\r\nsay but little, so complete was his amazement; but he voluntarily\r\nattested the thoroughness of his conversion by pulling out of his pocket\r\nand handing to Mr. McK. a twenty dollar gold piece to aid the passengers\r\non to freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn these hours of rest and joyful anticipation the necessities of both\r\nlarge and small were administered to according to their needs, before\r\nforwarding them still further. The time and attention required for so\r\nmany left but little opportunity, however, for the Secretary to write\r\ntheir narratives. He had only evening leisure for the work. Ten or\r\ntwelve of that party had to be sent off without having their stories\r\nrecorded. Daniel Robertson was one of this number; his name is simply\r\nentered on the roll, and, but for letters received from him, after he\r\npassed on North, no further knowledge would have been obtained. In\r\nPetersburg, whence he escaped, he left his wife, for whose deliverance\r\nhe felt bound to do everything that lay in his power, as the subjoined\r\nletters will attest:\r\n\r\n\r\n    HAVANA, August 11, 1856, Schuylkill Co., N.Y.\r\n\r\n    MR. WM. STILL--Dear Sir:--I came from Virginia in March, and was\r\n    at your office the last of March. My object in writing you, is\r\n    to inquire what I can do, or what can be done to help my wife to\r\n    escape from the same bondage that I was in. You will know by\r\n    your books that I was from Petersburg, Va., and that is where my\r\n    wife now is. I have received two or three letters from a lady in\r\n    that place, and the last one says, that my wife's mistress is\r\n    dead, and that she expects to be sold. I am very anxious to do\r\n    what I can for her before it is too late, and beg of you to\r\n    devise some means to get her away. Capt. the man that brought me\r\n    away, knows the colored agent at Petersburg, and knows he will\r\n    do all he can to forward my wife. The Capt. promised, that when\r\n    I could raise one hundred dollars for him that he would deliver\r\n    her in Philadelphia. Tell him that I can now raise the money,\r\n    and will forward it to you at any day that he thinks that he can\r\n    bring her. Please see the Captain and find when he will\r\n    undertake it, and then let me know when to forward the money to\r\n    you. I am at work for the Hon. Charles Cook, and can send the\r\n    money any day. My wife's name is Harriet Robertson, and the\r\n    agent at Petersburg knows her.\r\n\r\n    Please direct your answer, with all necessary directions, to N.\r\n    Coryell, of this village, and he will see that all is right.\r\n\r\n    Very respectfully,\r\n\r\n    DANIEL ROBERTSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    HAVANA, Aug. 18, 1856.\r\n\r\n    MR. WM. STILL--Dear Sir:--Yours of the 18th, for D. Robertson,\r\n    was duly received. In behalf of Daniel, I thank you kindly for\r\n    the interest you manifest in him. The letters that have gone\r\n    from him to his friends in Virginia, have been written by me,\r\n    and sent in such a manner as we thought would best ensure\r\n    safety. Yet I am well aware of the risk of writing, and have\r\n    restrained him as far as possible, and the last one I wrote was\r\n    to be the last, till an effort was made to reclaim his wife.\r\n    Daniel is a faithful, likely man, and is well liked by all who\r\n    know him. He is industrious and prudent, and is bending his\r\n    whole energies toward the reclaiming his wife. He can forward to\r\n    you the one hundred dollars at any day that it may be wanted,\r\n    and if you can do anything to forward his interests it will be\r\n    very gratefully received as an additional favor on your part. He\r\n    asks for no money, but your kindly efforts, which he regards\r\n    more highly than money.\r\n\r\n    Very respectfully, N. CORYELL.\r\n\r\n    The letters that have been written for him were dated \"Niagara\r\n    Falls, Canada West,\" and his friends think he is there--none of\r\n    them know to the contrary--it is important that they never do\r\n    know. N.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    HAVANA, Sept. 29, 1856.\r\n\r\n    MR. WM. STILL--Dear Sir:--I enclose herewith a draft on New\r\n    York, payable to your order, for $100, to be paid on the\r\n    delivery at Philadelphia of Daniel Robertson's wife.\r\n\r\n    You can readily see that it has been necessary for Daniel to\r\n    work almost night and day to have laid up so large an amount of\r\n    money, since the first of April, as this one hundred dollars.\r\n    Daniel is industrious and prudent, and saves all of his\r\n    earnings, above his most absolute wants. If the Captain is not\r\n    successful in getting Daniel's wife, you, of course, will return\r\n    the draft, without charge, as you said. I hope success will\r\n    attend him, for Daniel deserves to be rewarded, if ever man did.\r\n    Yours, &c.\r\n\r\n    N. CORYELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    HAVANA, Jan. 2, 1857.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:--Your favor containing draft on N. York, for Daniel\r\n    Robertson, came to hand on the 31st ult. Daniel begs to tender\r\n    his acknowledgments for your kind interest manifested in his\r\n    behalf, and says he hopes you will leave no measure untried\r\n    which has any appearance of success, and that the money shall be\r\n    forthcoming at a moment's notice. Daniel thinks that since\r\n    Christmas, the chances for his wife's deliverance are fewer than\r\n    before, for at that time he fears she was disposed of and\r\n    possibly went South.\r\n\r\n    The paper sent me, with your well-written article, was received,\r\n    and on reading it to Daniel, he knew some of the parties\r\n    mentioned in it--he was much pleased to hear it read. Daniel\r\n    spent New Year's in Elmira, about 18 miles from this place, and\r\n    there he met two whom he was well acquainted with.\r\n\r\n    Yours, &c.,\r\n\r\n    N. CORYELL.\r\n\r\n    WM. STILL, Esq., Phila.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch devotion to freedom, such untiring labor, such appeals as these\r\nletters contained awakened deep interest in the breasts of Daniel's new\r\nfriends, which spoke volumes in favor of the Slave and against\r\nslave-holders. But, alas, nothing could be done to relieve the sorrowing\r\nmind of poor Daniel for the deliverance of his wife in chains. The\r\nCommittee sympathized deeply with him, but could do no more. What other\r\nevents followed, in Daniel's life as a fugitive, were never made known\r\nto the Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArthur Spence also deserves a notice. He was from North Carolina, about\r\ntwenty-four years of age, and of pleasing appearance, and was heart and\r\nsoul in sympathy with the cause of the Underground Rail Road. In North\r\nCarolina he declared that he had been heavily oppressed by being\r\ncompelled to pay $175 per annum for his hire. In order to get rid of\r\nthis heavy load, by shrewd management he gained access to the\r\nkind-hearted Captain and procured an Underground Rail Road ticket. In\r\nleaving bondage, he was obliged to leave his mother, two brothers and\r\none sister. He appeared to be composed of just the kind of material for\r\nmaking a good British subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBen Dickinson. Ben was also a slave in North Carolina--located at\r\nEatontown, being the property of \"Miss Ann Blunt, who was very hard.\" In\r\nslave property Miss Blunt was interested to the number of about \"ninety\r\nhead.\" She was much in the habit of hiring out servants, and in thus\r\ndisposing of her slaves Ben thought she was a great deal more concerned\r\nin getting good prices for herself than good places for them. Indeed he\r\ndeclared that \"she did not care how mean the place was, if she could\r\nonly get her price.\" For three years Ben had Canada and the Underground\r\nRail Road in view, having been \"badly treated.\" At last the long-looked\r\nfor time arrived, and he conferred neither with master nor mistress, but\r\n\"picked himself up\" and \"took out.\" Age twenty-eight, medium size, quite\r\ndark, a good carpenter, and generally intelligent. Left two sisters,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nOf this heroic and promising party we can only mention, in conclusion,\r\none more passenger, namely:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTom Page. At the time of his arrival, his name only was enrolled on the\r\nbook. Yet he was not a passenger soon to be forgotten--he was but a mere\r\nboy, probably eighteen years of age; but a more apt, ready-witted,\r\nactive, intelligent and self-reliant fellow is not often seen.\r\n\r\nJudging from his smartness, under slavery, with no chances, it was easy\r\nto imagine how creditably he might with a white boy's chances have\r\nclimbed the hill of art and science. Obviously he had intellect enough,\r\nif properly cultivated, to fill any station within the ordinary reach of\r\nintelligent American citizens. He could read and write remarkably well\r\nfor a slave, and well did he understand his advantages in this\r\nparticular; indeed if slave-holders had only been aware of the growing\r\ntendency of Tom's mind, they would have rejoiced at hearing of his\r\ndeparture for Canada; he was a most dangerous piece of property to be\r\ngrowing up amongst slaves.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the Committee and going North his uncaged mind felt the\r\nneed of more education, and at the same time he was eager to make money,\r\nand do something in life. As he had no one to depend on, parents and\r\nrelatives being left behind in Norfolk, he felt that he must rely upon\r\nhimself, young as he was. He first took up his abode in Boston, or New\r\nBedford, where most of the party with whom he escaped went, and where he\r\nhad an aunt, and perhaps some other distant kin. There he worked and was\r\na live young man indeed--among the foremost in ideas and notions about\r\nfreedom, etc., as many letters from him bore evidence. After spending a\r\nyear or more in Massachusetts, he had a desire to see how the fugitives\r\nwere doing in Upper and Lower Canada, and if any better chances existed\r\nin these parts for men of his stamp.\r\n\r\nSome of his letters, from different places, gave proof of real thought\r\nand close observation, but they were not generally saved, probably were\r\nloaned to be read by friendly eyes. Nevertheless the two subjoined will,\r\nin a measure, suffice to give some idea of his intelligence, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BOSTON, Mass., Feb. 25th, 1857.\r\n\r\n    WILLIAM STILL, Esq.:--Dear Sir--I have not heard from you for\r\n    some time. I take this opportunity of writing you a few lines to\r\n    let you and all know that I am well at present and thank God for\r\n    it. Dear Sir, I hear that the under ground railroad was in\r\n    operation. I am glad to hear that. Give my best respects to your\r\n    family and also to Dr. L., Mr. Warrick, Mr. Camp and familys, to\r\n    Mr. Fisher, Mr. Taylor to all Friends names too numerous to\r\n    mention. Please to let me know when the road arrived with\r\n    another cargo. I want to come to see you all before long, if\r\n    nothing happens and life lasts. Mrs. Gault requested me to learn\r\n    of you if you ask Mr. Bagnal if he will see father and what he\r\n    says about the children. Please to answer as soon as possible.\r\n    No more at present from a friend,\r\n\r\n    THOMAS F. PAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y., Oct. 6th, '58.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:--I received your kind letter and I was very glad to\r\n    hear from you and your family. This leaves me well, and I hope\r\n    when this comes to hand it may find you the same. I have seen a\r\n    large number of your U.G.R.R. friends in my travels through the\r\n    Eastern as well as the Western States. Well there are a good\r\n    many from my own city who I know--some I talk to on private\r\n    matters and some I wont. Well around here there are so\r\n    many--Tom, Dick and Harry--that you do not know who your friend\r\n    is. So it don't hurt any one to be careful. Well, somehow or\r\n    another, I do not like Canada, or the Provinces. I have been to\r\n    St. John, N.B., Lower Province, or Lower Canada, also St.\r\n    Catharines, C.W., and all around the Canada side, and I do not\r\n    like it at all. The people seem to be so queer--though I suppose\r\n    if I had of went to Canada when I first came North to live, I\r\n    might like it by this time. I was home when Aunt had her\r\n    Ambro-type taken for you. She often speaks of your kindness to\r\n    her. There are a number of your friends wishes you well. My\r\n    little brother is going to school in Boston. The lady, Mrs.\r\n    Hillard, that my Aunt lives with, thinks a good deal of him. He\r\n    is very smart and I think, if he lives, he may be of some\r\n    account. Do you ever see my old friend, Capt. Fountain? Please\r\n    to give my love to him, and tell him to come to Boston, as there\r\n    are a number of his friends that would like to see him. My best\r\n    respects to all friends. I must now bring my short epistle to a\r\n    close, by saying I remain your friend truly,\r\n\r\n    THOMAS F. PAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile a portion of the party, on hand with him, came as passengers with\r\nCapt. P., another portion was brought by Capt. B., both parties arriving\r\nwithin twelve hours of each other; and both had likewise been frozen up\r\non the route for weeks with their respective live freight on board.\r\n\r\nThe sufferings for food, which they were called upon to endure, were\r\nbeyond description. They happened to have plenty of salt fat pork, and\r\nperhaps beans, Indian meal and some potatoes for standing dishes; the\r\nmore delicate necessaries did not probably last longer than the first or\r\nsecond week of their ice-bondage.\r\n\r\nWithout a doubt, one of these Captains left Norfolk about the twentieth\r\nof January, but did not reach Philadelphia till about the twentieth of\r\nMarch, having been frozen up, of course, during the greater part of that\r\ntime. Men, women and children were alike sharers in the common struggle\r\nfor freedom--were alike an hungered, in prison, naked, and sick, but it\r\nwas a fearful thing in those days for even women and children to whisper\r\ntheir sad lamentations in the city of Philadelphia, except to those\r\nfriendly to the Underground Rail Road.\r\n\r\nDoubtless, if these mothers, with their children and partners in\r\ntribulation, could have been seen as they arrived direct from the boats,\r\nmany hearts would have melted, and many tears would have found their way\r\ndown many cheeks. But at that time cotton was acknowledged to be\r\nKing--the Fugitive Slave Law was supreme, and the notorious decision of\r\nJudge Taney, that \"black men had no rights which white men were bound to\r\nrespect,\" echoed the prejudices of the masses too clearly to have made\r\nit safe to reveal the fact of their arrival, or even the heart-rending\r\ncondition of these Fugitives.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, they were not turned away empty, though at a peril they\r\nwere fed, aided, and comforted, and sent away well clothed. Indeed, so\r\nbountifully were the women and children supplied, that as they were\r\nbeing conveyed to the Camden and Amboy station, they looked more like a\r\npleasuring party than like fugitives. Some of the good friends of the\r\nslave sent clothing, and likewise cheered them with their presence.\r\n\r\n[Before the close of this volume, such friends and sympathizers will be\r\nmore particularly noticed in an appropriate place.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDRY ARRIVALS--LATTER PART OF DECEMBER, 1855, AND BEGINNING OF\r\nJANUARY, 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH CORNISH, Dorchester Co., Md.; LEWIS FRANCIS, _alias_ LEWIS\r\nJOHNSON, Harford Co., Md.; ALEXANDER MUNSON, Chestertown, Md.; SAMUEL\r\nand ANN SCOTT, Cecil Cross-Roads, Md.; WM. HENRY LAMINSON, Del.; ISAAC\r\nSTOUT, _alias_ GEORGE WASHINGTON, CAROLINE GRAVES, Md.; HENRY and ELIZA\r\nWASHINGTON, Alexandria, Va.; HENRY CHAMBERS, JOHN CHAMBERS, SAMUEL FALL,\r\nand THOMAS ANDERSON, Md.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph Cornish was about forty years of age when he escaped. The heavy\r\nbonds of Slavery made him miserable. He was a man of much natural\r\nability, quite dark, well-made, and said that he had been \"worked very\r\nhard.\" According to his statement, he had been an \"acceptable preacher\r\nin the African Methodist Church,\" and was also \"respected by the\r\nrespectable white and colored people in his neighborhood.\" He would not\r\nhave escaped but for fear of being sold, as he had a wife and five\r\nchildren to whom he was very much attached, but had to leave them\r\nbehind. Fortunately they were free.\r\n\r\nOf his ministry and connection with the Church, he spoke with feelings\r\nof apparent solemnity, evidently under the impression that the little\r\nflock he left would be without a shepherd. Of his master, Captain Samuel\r\nLe Count, of the U.S. Navy, he had not one good word to speak; at least\r\nnothing of the kind is found on the Record Book; but, on the contrary,\r\nhe declared that \"he was very hard on his servants, allowing them no\r\nchance whatever to make a little ready money for themselves.\" So in\r\nturning his face towards the Underground Rail Road, and his back against\r\nslavery, he felt that he was doing God service.\r\n\r\nThe Committee regarded him as a remarkable man, and was much impressed\r\nwith his story, and felt it to be a privilege and a pleasure to aid him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLewis Francis was a man of medium size, twenty-seven years of age,\r\ngood-looking and intelligent. He stated that he belonged to Mrs.\r\nDelinas, of Abingdon, Harford Co., Md., but that he had been hired out\r\nfrom a boy to a barber in Baltimore. For his hire his mistress received\r\neight dollars per month.\r\n\r\nTo encourage Lewis, his kind-hearted mistress allowed him out of his own\r\nwages the sum of two dollars and fifty cents per annum! His clothing he\r\ngot as best he could, but nothing did she allow him for that purpose.\r\nEven with this arrangement she had been dissatisfied of late years, and\r\nthought she was not getting enough out of Lewis; she, therefore, talked\r\nstrongly of selling him. This threat was very annoying to Lewis, so much\r\nso, that he made up his mind that he would one day let her see, that so\r\nfar as he was concerned, it was easier to talk of selling than it would\r\nbe to carry out her threat.\r\n\r\nWith this growing desire for freedom he gained what little light he\r\ncould on the subject of traveling, Canada, etc., and at a given time off\r\nhe started on his journey and found his way to the Committee, who\r\nimparted substantial aid as usual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander Munson, alias Samuel Garrett. This candidate for Canada was\r\nonly eighteen years of age; a well-grown lad, however, and had the one\r\nidea that \"all men were born free\" pretty deeply rooted in his mind. He\r\nwas quite smart, and of a chestnut color. By the will of his original\r\nowner, the slaves were all entitled to their freedom, but it appeared,\r\nfrom Alexander's story, that the executor of the estate did not regard\r\nthis freedom clause in the will. He had already sold some of the slaves,\r\nand others--he among them--were expecting to be sold before coming into\r\npossession of their freedom. Two of them had been sold to Alabama,\r\ntherefore, with these evil warnings, young Alexander resolved to strike\r\nout at once for Canada, despite Maryland slave-holders. With this bold\r\nand manly spirit he succeeded, of course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnna Scott and husband, Samuel Scott. This couple escaped from Cecil\r\nCross-Roads, Md. The wife, in this instance, evidently took the lead,\r\nand acted the more manly part in striking for freedom; therefore, our\r\nnotice of this arrival will chiefly relate to her..\r\n\r\nAnna was owned by a widow, named Mrs. Ann Elizabeth Lushy, who resided\r\non a farm of her own. Fifteen slaves, with other stock, were kept on the\r\nplace. She was accustomed to rule with severity, being governed by a\r\n\"high temper,\" and in nowise disposed to allow her slaves to enjoy even\r\nordinary privileges, and besides, would occasionally sell to the\r\nSouthern market. She was calculated to render slave life very unhappy.\r\nAnna portrayed her mistress's treatment of the slaves with much\r\nearnestness, especially when referring to the sale of her own brother\r\nand sister. Upon the whole, the mistress was so hateful to Anna, that\r\nshe resolved not to live in the house with her. During several years\r\nprior to her escape, Anna had been hired out, where she had been treated\r\na little more decently than her mistress was wont to do; on this account\r\nshe was less willing to put up with any subsequent abuse from her\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\nTo escape was the only remedy, so she made up her mind, that she would\r\nleave at all hazards. She gave her husband to understand, that she had\r\nresolved to seek a home in Canada. Fortunately, he was free, but slavery\r\nhad many ways of putting the yoke on the colored man, even though he\r\nmight be free; it was bound to keep him in ignorance, and at the same\r\ntime miserably abject, so that he would scarcely dare to look up in the\r\npresence of white people.\r\n\r\nSam, apparently, was one of the number who had been greatly wronged in\r\nthis particular. He had less spirit than his wife, who had been directly\r\ngoaded to desperation. He agreed, however, to stand by her in her\r\nstruggles while fleeing, and did so, for which he deserves credit. It\r\nmust be admitted, that it required some considerable nerve for a free\r\nman even to join his wife in an effort of this character. In setting\r\nout, Anna had to leave her father (Jacob Trusty), seven sisters and two\r\nbrothers. The names of the sisters were as follows: Emeline, Susan Ann,\r\nDelilah, Mary Eliza, Rosetta, Effie Ellender and Elizabeth; the\r\nbrothers--Emson and Perry. For the commencement of their journey they\r\navailed themselves of the Christmas holidays, but had to suffer from the\r\ncold weather they encountered. Yet they got along tolerably well, and\r\nwere much cheered by the attention and aid they received from the\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry Laminson came from near Newcastle, Delaware. He was smart\r\nenough to take advantage of the opportunity to escape at the age of\r\ntwenty-one. As he had given the matter his fullest attention for a long\r\ntime, he was prepared to make rapid progress when he did start, and as\r\nhe had no great distance to travel it is not unlikely, that while his\r\nmaster was one night sleeping soundly, this young piece of property\r\n(worth at least $1,000 in the market), was crossing Mason and Dixon's\r\nLine, and steering directly for Canada. Francis Harkins was the name of\r\nthe master. William did not give him a very bad character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington Gooseberry, alias Isaac Stout, also took advantage of\r\nthe holidays to separate from his old master, Anthony Rybold, a farmer\r\nliving near Newcastle, Delaware. Nothing but the desire to be free moved\r\nGeorge to escape. He was a young man about twenty-three years of age, of\r\na pure black color, in stature, medium size, and well-made. Nothing\r\nremarkable is noted in the book in any way connected with his life or\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCaroline Graves. Caroline was of the bond class belonging to the State\r\nof Maryland. Having reached the age of forty without being content, and\r\nseeing no bright prospect in the future, she made up her mind to break\r\naway from the bonds of Slavery and seek a more congenial atmosphere\r\namong strangers in Canada. She had had the privilege of trying two\r\nmasters in her life-time; the first she admitted was \"kind\" to her, but\r\nthe latter was \"cruel.\" After arriving in Canada, she wrote back as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    TORONTO, Jan. 22, 1856.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:--WILLIAM STILL--I have found my company they arrived\r\n    here on monday eving I found them on tusday evening. Please to\r\n    be so kind as to send them boxes we are here without close to\r\n    ware we have some white frendes is goin to pay for them at this\r\n    end of the road. The reason that we send this note we are afraid\r\n    the outher one woudent go strait because it wasent derected\r\n    wright. Please to send them by the express then thay wont be\r\n    lost. Please to derect these boxes for Carline Graives in the\r\n    car of mrs. Brittion. Please to send the bil of the boxes on\r\n    with them. Mrs. Brittion, Lousig street near young street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Graham and wife, Jane, alias Henry Washington and Eliza. The cold\r\nweather of January was preferred, in this instance, for traveling.\r\nIndeed matters were so disagreeable with them that they could not tarry\r\nin their then quarters any longer. George was twenty-four years of age,\r\nquite smart, pleasant countenance, and of dark complexion.\r\n\r\nHe had experienced \"rough usage\" all the way along through life, not\r\nunfrequently from severe floggings. Twice, within the last year, he had\r\nbeen sold. In order to prevent a renewal of these inflictions he\r\nresorted to the Underground Rail Road with his wife, to whom he had only\r\nbeen married six months.\r\n\r\nIn one sense, they appeared to be in a sad condition, it being the dead\r\nof winter, but their condition in Alexandria, under a brutal master and\r\nmistress which both had the misfortune to have, was much sadder. To give\r\nall their due, however, George's wife acknowledged, that she had been\r\n\"well treated under her old mistress,\" but through a change, she had\r\nfallen into the hands of a \"new one,\" by whom her life had been rendered\r\nmost \"miserable;\" so much so, that she was willing to do almost anything\r\nto get rid of her, and was, therefore, driven to join her husband in\r\nrunning away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Chambers, John Chambers, Samuel Fall, and Jonathan Fisher. This\r\nparty represented the more promising-looking field-hand slave population\r\nof Maryland. Henry and John were brothers, twenty-four and twenty-six\r\nyears of age, stout made, chestnut color, good-looking, but in height\r\nnot quite medium. Henry \"owed service or labor,\" to a fellow-man by the\r\nname of William Rybold, a farmer living near Sassafras Neck, Md. Henry\r\nevidently felt, that he did master Rybold no injustice in testifying\r\nthat he knew no good of him, although he had labored under him like a\r\nbeast of burden all his days. He had been \"clothed meanly,\" and \"poorly\r\nfed.\" He also alleged, that his mistress was worse than his master, as\r\nshe would \"think nothing of knocking and beating the slave women for\r\nnothing.\" John was owned by Thomas Murphy. From that day to this, Thomas\r\nmay have been troubling his brain to know why his man John treated him\r\nso shabbily as to leave him in the manner that he did. Jack had a good\r\nreason for his course, nevertheless. In his corn field-phrase he\r\ndeclared, that his master Murphy would not give you half clothes, and\r\nbesides he was a \"hard man,\" who kept Jack working out on hire.\r\nTherefore, feeling his wrongs keenly, Jack decided, with his other\r\nfriends, to run off and be free.\r\n\r\nSam, another comrade, was also owned by William Rybold. Sam had just\r\narrived at his maturity (twenty-one), when he was invited to join in the\r\nplot to escape. At first, it might be thought strange, why one so young\r\nshould seek to escape. A few brief words from Sam soon explained the\r\nmystery. It was this: his master, as he said, had been in the habit of\r\ntying him up by the hands and flogging him unmercifully; besides, in the\r\nallowance of food and clothing, he always \"stinted the slaves yet worked\r\nthem very hard.\" Sam's chances for education had been very unfavorable,\r\nbut he had mind enough to know that liberty was worth struggling for. He\r\nwas willing to make the trial with the other boys. He was of a dark\r\nchestnut color, and of medium size.\r\n\r\nJonathan belonged to A. Rybold, and was only nineteen years of age. All\r\nthat need be said in relation to his testimony, is, that it agreed with\r\nhis colleague's and fellow-servant's, Samuel. Before starting on their\r\njourney, they felt the need of new names, and in putting their wits\r\ntogether, they soon fixed this matter by deciding to pass in future by\r\nthe following names: James and David Green, John Henry, and Jonathan\r\nFisher.\r\n\r\nIn the brief sketches given in this chapter, some lost ones, seeking\r\ninformation of relatives, may find comfort, even if the general reader\r\nshould fail to be interested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART OF THE ARRIVALS IN DECEMBER, 1855.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JERVIS GOOSEBERRY and WILLIAM THOMAS FREEMAN, _alias_ EZEKIEL\r\nCHAMBERS; HENRY HOOPER; JACOB HALL, _alias_ HENRY THOMAS, and wife,\r\nHENRIETTA and child; Two men from near Chestertown, Md.; FENTON JONES;\r\nMARY CURTIS; WILLIAM BROWN; CHARLES HENRY BROWN; OLIVER PURNELL and\r\nISAAC FIDGET.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Jervis Gooseberry and William Thomas Freeman. The coming of this\r\nparty was announced in the subjoined letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n    SCHUYLKILL, 11th Mo., 29th, 1855.\r\n\r\n    WILLIAM STILL: DEAR FRIEND:--Those boys will be along by the\r\n    last Norristown train to-morrow evening. I think the train\r\n    leaves Norristown at 6 o'clock, but of this inform thyself. The\r\n    boys will be sent to a friend at Norristown, with instructions\r\n    to assist them in getting seats in the last train that leaves\r\n    Norristown to-morrow evening. They are two of the eleven who\r\n    left some time since, and took with them some of their master's\r\n    horses; I have told them to remain in the cars at Green street\r\n    until somebody meets them.\r\n\r\n    E.F. PENNYPACKER.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving arrived safely, by the way and manner indicated in E.F.\r\nPennypacker's note, as they were found to be only sixteen and seventeen\r\nyears of age, considerable interest was felt by the Acting Committee to\r\nhear their story. They were closely questioned in the usual manner. They\r\nproved to be quite intelligent, considering how young they were, and how\r\nthe harrow of Slavery had been upon them from infancy.\r\n\r\nThey escaped from Chestertown, Md., in company with nine others (they\r\nbeing a portion of the eleven who arrived in Wilmington, with two\r\ncarriages, etc., noticed on page 302), but, for prudential reasons they\r\nwere separated while traveling. Some were sent on, but the boys had to\r\nbe retained with friends in the country. Many such separations were\r\ninevitable. In this respect a great deal of care and trouble had to be\r\nendured for the sake of the cause.\r\n\r\nThomas Jervis, the elder boy, was quite dark, and stammered somewhat,\r\nyet he was active and smart. He stated that Sarah Maria Perkins was his\r\nmistress in Maryland. He was disposed to speak rather favorably of her,\r\nat least he said that she was \"tolerably kind\" to her servants. She,\r\nhowever, was in the habit of hiring out, to reap a greater revenue for\r\nthem, and did not always get them places where they were treated as well\r\nas she herself treated them. Tom left his father, Thomas Gooseberry, and\r\nthree sisters, Julia Ann, Mary Ellen, and Katie Bright, all slaves.\r\n\r\nEzekiel, the younger boy, was of a chestnut color, clever-looking,\r\nsmart, and well-grown, just such an one as a father enjoying the\r\nblessings of education and citizenship, might have felt a considerable\r\ndegree of pride in. He was owned by a man called John Dwa, who followed\r\n\"farming and drinking,\" and when under the influence of liquor, was\r\ndisposed to ill-treat the slaves. Ezekiel had not seen his mother for\r\nmany years, although she was living in Baltimore, and was known by the\r\nname of \"Dorcas Denby.\" He left no brothers nor sisters.\r\n\r\nThe idea of boys, so young and inexperienced as they were, being thrown\r\non the world, gave occasion for serious reflection. Still the Committee\r\nwere rejoiced that they were thus early in life, getting away from the\r\n\"Sum of all villanies.\" In talking with them, the Committee endeavored\r\nto impress them with right ideas as to how they should walk in life,\r\naided them, of course, and sent them off with a double share of advice.\r\nWhat has been their destiny since, is not known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Hooper, a young man of nineteen years of age, came from Maryland,\r\nin December, in a subsequent Underground Rail Road arrival. That he came\r\nin good order, and was aided and sent off, was fully enough stated on\r\nthe book, but nothing else; space, however was left for the writing out\r\nof his narrative, but it was never filled up. Probably the loose sheet\r\non which the items were jotted down, was lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJacob Hall, alias Henry Thomas, wife Henrietta, and child, were also\r\namong the December passengers. On the subject of freedom they were\r\nthoroughly converted. Although Jacob was only about twenty years of age,\r\nhe had seen enough of Slavery under his master, \"Major William\r\nHutchins,\" whom he described as a \"farmer, commissioner, drunkard, and\r\nhard master,\" to know that no hope could be expected from him, but if he\r\nremained, he would daily have to be under the \"harrow.\" The desire to\r\nwork for himself was so strong, that he could not reconcile his mind to\r\nthe demands of Slavery. While meditating upon freedom, he concluded to\r\nmake an effort with his wife and child to go to Canada.\r\n\r\nHis wife, Henrietta, who was then owned by a woman named Sarah Ann\r\nMcGough, was as unhappily situated as himself. Indeed Henrietta had come\r\nto the conclusion, that it was out of the question for a servant to\r\nplease her mistress, it mattered not how hard she might try; she also\r\nsaid, that her mistress drank, and that made her \"wus.\"\r\n\r\nBesides, she had sold Henrietta's brother and sister, and was then\r\ntaking steps to sell her,--had just had her appraised with this view. It\r\nwas quite easy, therefore, looking at their condition in the light of\r\nthese plain facts, for both husband and wife to agree, that they could\r\nnot make their condition any worse, even if they should be captured in\r\nattempting to escape. Henrietta also remembered, that years before her\r\nmother had escaped, and got off to Canada, which was an additional\r\nencouragement. Thus, as her own faith was strengthened, she could\r\nstrengthen that of her husband.\r\n\r\nTheir little child they resolved to cling to through thick and thin; so,\r\nin order that they might not have so far to carry him, father and mother\r\neach bridled a horse and \"took out\" in the direction of the first\r\nUnderground Rail Road station. Their faithful animals proved of\r\nincalculable service, but they were obliged to turn them loose on the\r\nroad without even having the opportunity or pleasure of rewarding them\r\nwith a bountiful feed of oats.\r\n\r\nAlthough they had strange roads, woods and night scenes to pass through,\r\nyet they faltered not. They found friends and advisers on the road,\r\nhowever, and reached the Committee in safety, who was made to rejoice\r\nthat such promising-looking \"property\" could come out of Ladies' Manor,\r\nMaryland. The Committee felt that they had acted wisely in taking the\r\nhorses to assist them the first night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next arrival is recorded thus: \"Dec. 10, 1855, Arrived, two men from\r\nnear Chestertown, Md. They came to Wilmington in a one horse wagon, and\r\nthrough aid of T.G. they were sent on.\" (Further account at the time,\r\nwritten on a loose piece of paper, is among the missing).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFenton Jones escaped from Frederick, Md. After arriving in the\r\nneighborhood of Ereildoun, Pa., he was induced to tarry awhile for the\r\npurpose of earning means to carry him still farther. But he was soon led\r\nto apprehend danger, and was advised and directed to apply to the\r\nVigilance Committee of Philadelphia for the needed aid, which he did,\r\nand was dispatched forthwith to Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the same time a young woman arrived, calling herself Mary Curtis.\r\nShe was from Baltimore, and was prompted to escape to keep from being\r\nsold. She was nineteen years of age, small size, dark complexion. No\r\nspecial incidents in her life were noted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Brown came next. If others had managed to make their way out of\r\nthe prison-house without great difficulties, it was far from William to\r\nmeet with such good luck, as he had suffered excessively for five weeks\r\nwhile traveling. It was an easy matter for a traveler to get lost, not\r\nknowing the roads, nor was it safe to apply to a stranger for\r\ninformation or direction--therefore, in many instances, the journey\r\nwould either have to be given up, or be prosecuted, suffering almost to\r\nthe death.\r\n\r\nIn the trying circumstances in which William found himself, dark as\r\neverything looked, he could not consent to return to his master, as he\r\nfelt persuaded, that if he did, there would be no rest on earth for him.\r\nHe well remembered, that, because he had resisted being flogged (being\r\nhigh spirited), his master had declined to sell him for the express\r\npurpose of making an example of him--as a warning to the other slaves on\r\nthe place. William was as much opposed to being thus made use of as he\r\nwas to being flogged. His reflections and his stout heart enabled him to\r\nendure five weeks of severe suffering while fleeing from oppression. Of\r\ncourse, when he did succeed, the triumph was unspeakably joyous.\r\nDoubtless, he had thought a great deal during this time, and being an\r\nintelligent fugitive, he interested the Committee greatly.\r\n\r\nThe man that he escaped from was called William Elliott, a farmer,\r\nliving in Prince George's county, Md. William Elliott claimed the right\r\nto flog and used it too. William, however, gave him the character of\r\nbeing among the moderate slave-holders of that part of the country. This\r\nwas certainly a charitable view. William was of a chestnut color, well\r\nmade, and would have commanded, under the \"hammer,\" a high price, if his\r\napparent intelligence had not damaged him. He left his father,\r\ngrand-mother, four sisters and two brothers, all living where he fled\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Henry Brown. This \"chattel\" was owned by Dr. Richard Dorsey, of\r\nCambridge, Maryland. Up to twenty-seven years of age, he had experienced\r\nand observed how slaves were treated in his neighborhood, and he made up\r\nhis mind that he was not in favor of the Institution in any form\r\nwhatever. Indeed he felt, that for a man to put his hand in his\r\nneighbor's pocket and rob him, was nothing compared to the taking of a\r\nman's hard earnings from year to year. Really Charles reasoned the case\r\nso well, in his uncultured country phrases, that the Committee was\r\nrather surprised, and admired his spirit in escaping. He was a man of\r\nnot quite medium size, with marked features of mind and character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOliver Purnell and Isaac Fidget arrived from Berlin, Md. Each had\r\ndifferent owners. Oliver stated that Mose Purnell had owned him, and\r\nthat he was a tolerably moderate kind of a slave-holder, although he was\r\noccasionally subject to fractious turns. Oliver simply gave as his\r\nreason for leaving in the manner that he did, that he wanted his \"own\r\nearnings.\" He felt that he had as good a right to the fruit of his labor\r\nas anybody else. Despite all the pro-slavery teachings he had listened\r\nto all his life, he was far from siding with the pro-slavery doctrines.\r\nHe was about twenty-six years of age, chestnut color, wide awake and a\r\nman of promise; yet it was sadly obvious that he had been blighted and\r\ncursed by slavery even in its mildest forms. He left his parents, two\r\nbrothers and three sisters all slaves in the hands of Purnell, the\r\nmaster whom he deserted.\r\n\r\nIsaac, his companion, was about thirty years of age, dark, and in\r\nintellect about equal to the average passengers on the Underground Rail\r\nRoad. He had a very lively hope of finding his wife in freedom, she\r\nhaving escaped the previous Spring; but of her whereabouts he was\r\nignorant, as he had had no tidings of her since her departure. A lady by\r\nthe name of Mrs. Fidget held the deed for Isaac. He spoke kindly of her,\r\nas he thought she treated her slaves quite as well at least as the best\r\nof slave-holders in his neighborhood. His view was a superficial one, it\r\nmeant only that they had not been beaten and starved half to death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the heroic adventures and sufferings of Slaves struggling for\r\nfreedom, shall be read by coming generations, were it not for\r\nunquestioned statutes upholding Slavery in its dreadful heinousness,\r\npeople will hardly be able to believe that such atrocities were enacted\r\nin the nineteenth century, under a highly enlightened, Christianized,\r\nand civilized government. Having already copied a statute enacted by the\r\nState of Virginia, as a sample of Southern State laws, it seems fitting\r\nthat the Fugitive Slave Bill, enacted by the Congress of the United\r\nStates, shall be also copied, in order to commemorate that most infamous\r\ndeed, by which, it may be seen, how great were the bulwarks of\r\noppression to be surmounted by all who sought to obtain freedom by\r\nflight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FUGITIVE SLAVE BILL OF 1850.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"AN ACT RESPECTING FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE, AND PERSONS ESCAPING FROM THE\r\nSERVICE OF THEIR MASTERS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\n    United States of America in Congress assembled:\r\n\r\n    That the persons who have been, or may hereafter be appointed\r\n    commissioners, in virtue of any Act of Congress, by the circuit\r\n    courts of the United States, and who, in consequence of such\r\n    appointment, are authorized to exercise the powers that any\r\n    justice of the peace or other magistrate of any of the United\r\n    States, may exercise in respect to offenders for any crime or\r\n    offence against the United States, by arresting, imprisoning, or\r\n    bailing the same under and by virtue of the thirty-third section\r\n    of the act of the twenty-fourth of September, seventeen hundred\r\n    and eighty-nine, entitled, \"An act to establish the judicial\r\n    courts of the United States,\" shall be, and are hereby\r\n    authorized and required to exercise and discharge all the powers\r\n    and duties conferred by this act.\r\n\r\n    Sec. 2.

And be it further enacted: That the circuit courts of\r\n    the United States, and the superior courts of each organized\r\n    territory of the United States, shall, from time to time,\r\n    enlarge the number of Commissioners, with a view to afford\r\n    reasonable facilities to reclaim fugitives from labor, and to\r\n    the prompt discharge of the duties imposed by this act.\r\n\r\n    SEC. 4. And be it further enacted, that the commissioners above\r\n    named, shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the judges of the\r\n    circuit and district courts of the United States, in their\r\n    respective circuits and districts within the several States, and\r\n    the judges of the superior courts of the Territories severally\r\n    and collectively, in term time and vacation; and shall grant\r\n    certificates to such claimants, upon satisfactory proof being\r\n    made, with authority to take and remove such fugitives from\r\n    service or labor, under the restrictions herein contained, to\r\n    the State or territory from which such persons may have escaped\r\n    or fled.\r\n\r\n    SEC. 5. And be it further enacted: That it shall be the duty of\r\n    all marshals and deputy marshals, to obey and execute all\r\n    warrants and precepts issued under the provisions of this act,\r\n    when to them directed; and should any marshal or deputy marshal\r\n    refuse to receive such warrant or other process when tendered,\r\n    or to use all proper means diligently to execute the same, he\r\n    shall, on conviction thereof, be fined in the sum of one\r\n    thousand dollars to the use of such claimant, on the motion of\r\n    such claimant by the circuit or district court for the district\r\n    of such marshal; and after arrest of such fugitive by the\r\n    marshal, or his deputy, or whilst at any time in his custody,\r\n    under the provisions of this act, should such fugitive escape,\r\n    whether with or without the assent of such marshal or his\r\n    deputy, such marshal shall be liable, on his official bond, to\r\n    be prosecuted, for the benefit of such claimant, for the full\r\n    value of the service or labor of said fugitive in the State,\r\n    Territory or district whence he escaped; and the better to\r\n    enable the said commissioners, when thus appointed, to execute\r\n    their duties faithfully and efficiently, in conformity with the\r\n    requirements of the Constitution of the United States, and of\r\n    this act, they are hereby authorized and empowered, within their\r\n    counties respectively, to appoint in writing under their hands,\r\n    any one or more suitable persons, from time to time, to execute\r\n    all such warrants and other process as may be issued by them in\r\n    the lawful performance of their respective duties, with an\r\n    authority to such commissioners, or the persons to be appointed\r\n    by them, to execute process as aforesaid, to summon and call to\r\n    their aid the bystanders or posse comitatus, of the proper\r\n    county, when necessary to insure a faithful observance of the\r\n    clause of the Constitution referred to, in conformity with the\r\n    provisions of this act; and all good citizens are hereby\r\n    commanded to aid and assist in the prompt and efficient\r\n    execution of this law, whenever their services may be required,\r\n    as aforesaid, for that purpose; and said warrants shall run and\r\n    be executed by said officers anywhere in the State within which\r\n    they are issued.\r\n\r\n    SEC. 6. And be it further enacted, That when a person held to\r\n    service or labor in any State or Territory of the United States,\r\n    has heretofore, or shall hereafter escape into another State or\r\n    Territory of the United States, the person or persons to whom\r\n    such service or labor may be due, or his, her or their agent or\r\n    attorney, duly authorized, by power of attorney, in writing,\r\n    acknowledged and certified under the seal of some legal office\r\n    or court of the State or Territory, in which the same may be\r\n    executed, may pursue and reclaim such fugitive person, either by\r\n    procuring a warrant from some one of the courts, judges, or\r\n    commissioners aforesaid, of the proper circuit, district or\r\n    county, for the apprehension of such fugitive from service or\r\n    labor, or by seizing and arresting such fugitive, where the same\r\n    can be done without process, and by taking, or causing such\r\n    person to be taken, forthwith, before such court, judge or\r\n    commissioner, whose duty it shall be to hear and determine the\r\n    case of such claimant in a summary manner, and upon satisfactory\r\n    proof being made, by deposition or affidavit, in writing, to be\r\n    taken and certified by such court, judge or commissioner, or by\r\n    other satisfactory testimony, duly taken and certified by some\r\n    court, magistrate, justice of the peace, or other legal officer\r\n    authorized to administer an oath and take depositions under the\r\n    laws of the State or Territory from which such person owing\r\n    service or labor may have escaped, with a certificate of such\r\n    magistrate, or other authority, as aforesaid, with the seal of\r\n    the proper court or officer thereto attached, which seal shall\r\n    be sufficient to establish the competency of the proof, and with\r\n    proof also, by affidavit, of the identity of the person whose\r\n    service or labor is claimed to be due, as aforesaid, that the\r\n    person so arrested does in fact owe service or labor to the\r\n    person or persons claiming him or her, in the State or Territory\r\n    from which such fugitive may have escaped, as aforesaid, and\r\n    that said person escaped, to make out and deliver to such\r\n    claimant, his or her agent or attorney, a certificate setting\r\n    forth the substantial facts as to the service or labor due from\r\n    such fugitive to the claimant, and of his or her escape from the\r\n    State or Territory in which such service or labor was due, to\r\n    the State or Territory, in which he or she was arrested, with\r\n    authority to such claimant, or his or her agent or attorney, to\r\n    use such reasonable force and restraint as may be necessary,\r\n    under the circumstances of the case, to take and remove such\r\n    fugitive person back to the State or Territory from whence he or\r\n    she may have escaped, as aforesaid. In no trial or hearing,\r\n    under this act, shall the testimony of such alleged fugitives be\r\n    admitted in evidence, and the certificates in this and the first\r\n    section mentioned, shall be conclusive of the right of the\r\n    person or persons in whose favor granted to remove such\r\n    fugitives to the State or Territory from which they escaped, and\r\n    shall prevent all molestation of said person or persons by any\r\n    process issued by any court, judge, magistrate, or other person\r\n    whomsoever.\r\n\r\n    SEC. 7.

And be it further enacted, That the Marshals, their\r\n    deputies, and the clerks of the said districts and territorial\r\n    courts, shall be paid for their services the like fees as may be\r\n    allowed to them for similar services in other cases; and where\r\n    such services are rendered exclusively in the arrest, custody,\r\n    and delivery of the fugitives to the claimant, his or her agent,\r\n    or attorney, or where such supposed fugitive may be discharged\r\n    out of custody from the want of sufficient proof, as aforesaid,\r\n    then such fees are to be paid in the whole by such complainant,\r\n    his agent or attorney, and in all cases where the proceedings\r\n    are before a Commissioner, he shall be entitled to a fee of ten\r\n    dollars in full for his services in each case, upon the delivery\r\n    of the said certificate to the claimant, his or her agent or\r\n    attorney; or a fee of five dollars in cases where proof shall\r\n    not, in the opinion of said Commissioner, warrant such\r\n    certificate and delivery, inclusive of all services incident to\r\n    such arrest and examination, to be paid in either case, by the\r\n    claimant, his or her agent or attorney. The person or persons\r\n    authorized to execute the process to be issued by such\r\n    Commissioners for the arrest and detention of fugitives from\r\n    service or labor, as aforesaid, shall also be entitled to a fee\r\n    of five dollars each for each person he or they may arrest and\r\n    take before any such Commissioners, as aforesaid, at the\r\n    instance and request of such claimant, with such other fees as\r\n    may be deemed reasonable by such Commissioner for such other\r\n    additional services as may be necessarily performed by him or\r\n    them; such as attending to the examination, keeping the fugitive\r\n    in custody, and providing him with food and lodgings during his\r\n    detention, and until the final determination of such\r\n    Commissioner; and in general for performing such other duties as\r\n    may be required by such claimant, his or her attorney or agent\r\n    or commissioner in the premises; such fees to be made up in\r\n    conformity with the fees usually charged by the officers of the\r\n    courts of justice within the proper district or county as far as\r\n    may be practicable, and paid by such claimants, their agents or\r\n    attorneys, whether such supposed fugitive from service or labor\r\n    be ordered to be delivered to such claimants by the final\r\n    determination of such Commissioners or not.\r\n\r\n    SEC. 9. And be it further enacted, That upon affidavit made by\r\n    the claimant of such fugitive, his agent or attorney, after such\r\n    certificate has been issued, that he has reason to apprehend\r\n    that such fugitive will be rescued by force from his or their\r\n    possession before he can be taken beyond the limits of the State\r\n    in which the arrest is made, it shall be the duty of the officer\r\n    making the arrest to retain such fugitive in his custody, and to\r\n    remove him to the State whence he fled, and there to deliver him\r\n    to said claimant, his agent or attorney. And to this end the\r\n    officer aforesaid is hereby authorized and required to employ so\r\n    many persons as he may deem necessary, to overcome such force,\r\n    and to retain them in his service so long as circumstances may\r\n    require; the said officer and his assistants, while so employed,\r\n    to receive the same compensation, and to be allowed the same\r\n    expenses as are now allowed by law for the transportation of\r\n    criminals, to be certified by the judge of the district within\r\n    which the arrest is made, and paid out of the treasury of the\r\n    United States.\r\n\r\n    SEC. 10. And be it further enacted, That when any person held to\r\n    service or labor in any State or Territory, or in the District\r\n    of Columbia, shall escape therefrom, the party to whom such\r\n    service or labor shall be due, his, her, or their agent, or\r\n    attorney may apply to any court of record therein, or judge\r\n    thereof in vacation, and make such satisfactory proof to such\r\n    court or judge in vacation, of the escape aforesaid, and that\r\n    the person escaping owed service or labor to such party.\r\n    Thereupon the court shall cause a record to be made of the\r\n    matters so proved, and also a personal description of the person\r\n    so escaping, with such convenient certainty as may be; and a\r\n    transcript of such record, authenticated by the attestation of\r\n    the clerk, and of the seal of said court being produced in any\r\n    other State, Territory or District in which the person so\r\n    escaping may be found, and being exhibited to any judge,\r\n    commissioner, or other officer authorized by the law of the\r\n    United States to cause persons escaping from, service or labor\r\n    to be delivered up, shall be held and taken to be full and\r\n    conclusive evidence of the fact of escape, and that the service\r\n    or labor of the person escaping is due to the party in such\r\n    record mentioned. And upon the production, by the said party, of\r\n    other and further evidence, if necessary, either oral or by\r\n    affidavit, in addition to what is contained in said record of\r\n    the identity of the person escaping, he or she shall be\r\n    delivered up to the claimant. And said court, commissioners,\r\n    judge, or other persons authorized by this act to grant\r\n    certificates to claimants of fugitives, shall, upon the\r\n    production of the record and other evidence aforesaid, grant to\r\n    such claimant a certificate of his right to take any such\r\n    person, identified and proved to be owing service or labor as\r\n    aforesaid, which certificate shall authorize such claimant to\r\n    seize, or arrest, and transport such person to the State or\r\n    Territory from which he escaped: Provided, That nothing herein\r\n    contained shall be construed as requiring the production of a\r\n    transcript of such record as evidence as aforesaid, but in its\r\n    absence, the claim shall be heard and determined upon other\r\n    satisfactory proofs competent in law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SLAVE-HUNTING TRAGEDY IN LANCASTER COUNTY, IN SEPTEMBER, 1851.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"TREASON AT CHRISTIANA.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving inserted the Fugitive Slave Bill in these records of the\r\nUnderground Rail Road, one or two slave cases will doubtless suffice to\r\nillustrate the effect of its passage on the public mind, and the colored\r\npeople in particular. The deepest feelings of loathing, contempt and\r\nopposition were manifested by the opponents of Slavery on every hand.\r\nAnti-slavery papers, lecturers, preachers, etc., arrayed themselves\r\nboldly against it on the ground of its inhumanity and violation of the\r\nlaws of God.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the slave-holders South, and their pro-slavery\r\nadherents in the North demanded the most abject obedience from all\r\nparties, regardless of conscience or obligation to God. In order to\r\ncompel such obedience, as well as to prove the practicability of the\r\nlaw, unbounded zeal daily marked the attempt on the part of\r\nslave-holders and slave-catchers to refasten the fetters on the limbs of\r\nfugitives in different parts of the North, whither they had escaped.\r\n\r\nIn this dark hour, when colored men's rights were so insecure, as a\r\nmatter of self-defence, they felt called upon to arm themselves and\r\nresist all kidnapping intruders, although clothed with the authority of\r\nwicked law. Among the most exciting cases tending to justify this\r\ncourse, the following may be named:\r\n\r\nJames Hamlet was the first slave case who was summarily arrested under\r\nthe Fugitive Slave Law, and sent back to bondage from New York.\r\n\r\nWilliam and Ellen Craft were hotly pursued to Boston by hunters from\r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\nAdam Gibson, a free colored man, residing in Philadelphia, was arrested,\r\ndelivered into the hands of his alleged claimants, by commissioner\r\nEdward D. Ingraham, and hurried into Slavery.\r\n\r\nEuphemia Williams (the mother of six living children),--her case excited\r\nmuch interest and sympathy.\r\n\r\nShadrach was arrested and rescued in Boston.\r\n\r\nHannah Dellum and her child were returned to Slavery from Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThomas Hall and his wife were pounced upon at midnight in Chester\r\ncounty, beaten and dragged off to Slavery, etc.\r\n\r\nAnd, as if gloating over their repeated successes, and utterly\r\nregardless of all caution, about one year after the passage of this\r\nnefarious bill, a party of slave-hunters arranged for a grand capture at\r\nChristiana.\r\n\r\nOne year from the passage of the law, at a time when alarm and\r\nexcitement were running high, the most decided stand was taken at\r\nChristiana, in the State of Pennsylvania, to defeat the law, and defend\r\nfreedom. Fortunately for the fugitives the plans of the slave-hunters\r\nand officials leaked out while arrangements were making in Philadelphia\r\nfor the capture, and, information being sent to the Anti-slavery office,\r\na messenger was at once dispatched to Christiana to put all persons\r\nsupposed to be in danger on their guard.\r\n\r\nAmong those thus notified, were brave hearts, who did not believe in\r\nrunning away from slave-catchers. They resolved to stand up for the\r\nright of self-defence. They loved liberty and hated Slavery, and when\r\nthe slave-catchers arrived, they were prepared for them. Of the contest,\r\non that bloody morning, we have copied a report, carefully written at\r\nthe time, by C.M. Burleigh, editor of the \"Pennsylvania Freeman,\" who\r\nvisited the scene of battle, immediately after it was over, and\r\ndoubtless obtained as faithful an account of all the facts in the case,\r\nas could then be had.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Last Thursday morning, (the 11th inst,), a peaceful\r\n    neighborhood in the borders of Lancaster county, was made the\r\n    scene of a bloody battle, resulting from an attempt to capture\r\n    seven colored men as fugitive slaves. As the reports of the\r\n    affray which came to us were contradictory, and having good\r\n    reason to believe that those of the daily press were grossly\r\n    one-sided and unfair, we repaired to the scene of the tragedy,\r\n    and, by patient inquiry and careful examination, endeavored to\r\n    learn the real facts. To do this, from the varying and\r\n    conflicting statements which we encountered, scarcely two of\r\n    which agreed in every point, was not easy; but we believe the\r\n    account we give below, as the result of these inquiries, is\r\n    substantially correct.\r\n\r\n    Very early on the 11th inst. a party of slave-hunters went into\r\n    a neighborhood about two miles west of Christiana, near the\r\n    eastern border of Lancaster county, in pursuit of fugitive\r\n    slaves. The party consisted of Edward Gorsuch, his son,\r\n    Dickerson Gorsuch, his nephew, Dr. Pearce, Nicholas Hutchins,\r\n    and others, all from Baltimore county, Md., and one Henry H.\r\n    Kline, a notorious slave-catching constable from Philadelphia,\r\n    who had been deputized by Commissioner Ingraham for this\r\n    business. At about day-dawn they were discovered lying in an\r\n    ambush near the house of one William Parker, a colored man, by\r\n    an inmate of the house, who had started for his work. He fled\r\n    back to the house, pursued by the slave-hunters, who entered the\r\n    lower part of the house, but were unable to force their way into\r\n    the upper part, to which the family had retired. A horn was\r\n    blown from an upper window; two shots were fired, both, as we\r\n    believe, though we are not certain, by the assailants, one at\r\n    the colored man who fled into the house, and the other at the\r\n    inmates, through the window. No one was wounded by either. A\r\n    parley ensued. The slave-holder demanded his slaves, who he said\r\n    were concealed in the house. The colored men presented\r\n    themselves successively at the window, and asked if they were\r\n    the slaves claimed; Gorsuch said, that neither of them was his\r\n    slave. They told him that they were the only colored men in the\r\n    house, and were determined never to be taken alive as slaves.\r\n    Soon the colored people of the neighborhood, alarmed by the\r\n    horn, began to gather, armed with guns, axes, corn-cutters, or\r\n    clubs. Mutual threatenings were uttered by the two parties. The\r\n    slave-holders told the blacks that resistance would be useless,\r\n    as they had a party of thirty men in the woods near by. The\r\n    blacks warned them again to leave, as they would die before they\r\n    would go into Slavery.\r\n\r\n    From an hour to an hour and a half passed in these parleyings,\r\n    angry conversations, and threats; the blacks increasing by new\r\n    arrivals, until they probably numbered from thirty to fifty,\r\n    most of them armed in some way. About this time, Castner\r\n    Hanaway, a white man, and a Friend, who resided in the\r\n    neighborhood, rode up, and was soon followed by Elijah Lewis,\r\n    another Friend, a merchant, in Cooperville, both gentlemen\r\n    highly esteemed as worthy and peaceable citizens. As they came\r\n    up, Kline, the deputy marshal, ordered them to aid him, as a\r\n    United States officer, to capture the fugitive slaves. They\r\n    refused of course, as would any man not utterly destitute of\r\n    honor, humanity, and moral principle, and warned the assailants\r\n    that it was madness for them to attempt to capture fugitive\r\n    slaves there, or even to remain, and begged them if they wished\r\n    to save their own lives, to leave the ground. Kline replied, \"Do\r\n    you really think so?\" \"Yes,\" was the answer, \"the sooner you\r\n    leave, the better, if you would prevent bloodshed.\" Kline then\r\n    left the ground, retiring into a very safe distance into a\r\n    cornfield, and toward the woods. The blacks were so exasperated\r\n    by his threats, that, but for the interposition of the two white\r\n    Friends, it is very doubtful whether he would have escaped\r\n    without injury. Messrs. Hanaway and Lewis both exerted their\r\n    influence to dissuade the colored people from violence, and\r\n    would probably have succeeded in restraining them, had not the\r\n    assailing party fired upon them. Young Gorsuch asked his father\r\n    to leave, but the old man refused, declaring, as it is said and\r\n    believed, that he would \"go to hell, or have his slaves.\"\r\n\r\n    Finding they could do nothing further, Hanaway and Lewis both\r\n    started to leave, again counselling the slave-hunters to go\r\n    away, and the colored people to peace, but had gone but a few\r\n    rods, when one of the inmates of the house attempted to come out\r\n    at the door. Gorsuch presented his revolver, ordering him back.\r\n    The colored man replied, \"You had better go away, if you don't\r\n    want to get hurt,\" and at the same time pushed him aside and\r\n    passed out. Maddened at this, and stimulated by the question of\r\n    his nephew, whether he would \"take such an insult from a d----d\r\n    nigger,\" Gorsuch fired at the colored man, and was followed by\r\n    his son and nephew, who both fired their revolvers. The fire was\r\n    returned by the blacks, who made a rush upon them at the same\r\n    time. Gorsuch and his son fell, the one dead the other wounded.\r\n    The rest of the party after firing their revolvers, fled\r\n    precipitately through the corn and to the woods, pursued by some\r\n    of the blacks. One was wounded, the rest escaped unhurt. Kline,\r\n    the deputy marshal, who now boasts of his miraculous escape from\r\n    a volley of musket-balls, had kept at a safe distance, though\r\n    urged by young Gorsuch to stand by his father and protect him,\r\n    when he refused to leave the ground. He of course came off\r\n    unscathed. Several colored men were wounded, but none severely.\r\n    Some had their hats or their clothes perforated with bullets;\r\n    others had flesh wounds. They said that the Lord protected them,\r\n    and they shook the bullets from their clothes. One man found\r\n    several shot in his boot, which seemed to have spent their force\r\n    before reaching him, and did not even break the skin. The\r\n    slave-holders having fled, several neighbors, mostly Friends and\r\n    anti-slavery men, gathered to succor the wounded and take charge\r\n    of the dead. We are told that Parker himself protected the\r\n    wounded man from his excited comrades, and brought water and a\r\n    bed from his own house for the invalid, thus showing that he was\r\n    as magnanimous to his fallen enemy as he was brave in the\r\n    defence of his own liberty. The young man was then removed to a\r\n    neighboring house, where the family received him with the\r\n    tenderest kindness and paid him every attention, though they\r\n    told him in Quaker phrase, that \"they had no unity with his\r\n    cruel business,\" and were very sorry to see him engaged in it.\r\n    He was much affected by their kindness, and we are told,\r\n    expressed his regret that he had been thus engaged, and his\r\n    determination, if his life was spared, never again to make a\r\n    similar attempt. His wounds are very severe, and it is feared\r\n    mortal. All attempts to procure assistance to capture the\r\n    fugitive slaves failed, the people in the neighborhood either\r\n    not relishing the business of slave-catching, or at least, not\r\n    choosing to risk their lives in it. There was a very great\r\n    reluctance felt to going even to remove the body and the wounded\r\n    man, until several abolitionists and Friends had collected for\r\n    that object, when others found courage to follow on. The\r\n    excitement caused by this most melancholy affair is very great\r\n    among all classes. The abolitionists, of course, mourn the\r\n    occurrence, while they see in it a legitimate fruit of the\r\n    Fugitive Slave Law, just such a harvest of blood as they had\r\n    long feared that the law would produce, and which they had\r\n    earnestly labored to prevent. We believe that they alone, of all\r\n    classes of the nation, are free from responsibility for its\r\n    occurrence, having wisely foreseen the danger, and faithfully\r\n    labored to avert it by removing its causes, and preventing the\r\n    inhuman policy which has hurried on the bloody convulsion.\r\n\r\n    The enemies of the colored people, are making this the occasion\r\n    of fresh injuries, and a more bitter ferocity toward that\r\n    defenceless people, and of new misrepresentation and calumnies\r\n    against the abolitionists.\r\n\r\n    The colored people, though the great body of them had no\r\n    connection with this affair, are hunted like partridges upon the\r\n    mountains, by the relentless horde which has been poured forth\r\n    upon them, under the pretense of arresting the parties concerned\r\n    in the fight. When we reached Christiana, on Friday afternoon,\r\n    we found that the Deputy-Attorney Thompson, of Lancaster, was\r\n    there, and had issued warrants, upon the depositions of Kline\r\n    and others, for the arrest of all suspected persons. A company\r\n    of police were scouring the neighborhood in search of colored\r\n    people, several of whom were seized while at their work near by,\r\n    and brought in.\r\n\r\n    CAstner Hanaway and Elijah Lewis, hearing that warrants were\r\n    issued against them, came to Christiana, and voluntarily gave\r\n    themselves up, calm and strong in the confidence of their\r\n    innocence. They, together with the arrested colored men, were\r\n    sent to Lancaster jail that night.\r\n\r\n    The next morning we visited the ground of the battle, and the\r\n    family where young Gorsuch now lives, and while there, we saw a\r\n    deposition which he had just made, that he believed no white\r\n    persons were engaged in the affray, beside his own party. As he\r\n    was on the ground during the whole controversy, and deputy\r\n    Marshall Kline had discreetly run off into the corn-field,\r\n    before the fighting began, the hireling slave-catcher's eager\r\n    and confident testimony against our white friends, will, we\r\n    think, weigh lightly with impartial men.\r\n\r\n    On returning to Christiana, we found that the United States\r\n    Marshal from the city, had arrived at that place, accompanied by\r\n    Commissioner Ingraham, Mr. Jones, a special commissioner of the\r\n    United States, from Washington, the U.S. District Attorney\r\n    Ashmead, with forty-five U.S. Marines from the Navy Yard, and a\r\n    posse of about forty of the City Marshal's police, together with\r\n    a large body of special constables, eager for such a manhunt,\r\n    from Columbia and Lancaster and other places. This crowd divided\r\n    into parties, of from ten to twenty-five, and scoured the\r\n    country, in every direction, for miles around, ransacking the\r\n    houses of the colored people, and captured every colored man\r\n    they could find, with several colored women, and two other white\r\n    men. Never did our heart bleed with deeper pity for the peeled\r\n    and persecuted colored people, than when we saw this troop let\r\n    loose upon them, and witnessed the terror and distress which its\r\n    approach excited in families, wholly innocent of the charges\r\n    laid against them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a few extracts from the editorials of some of the\r\nleading papers, will suffice to show the state of public feeling at that\r\ntime, and the dreadful opposition abolitionists and fugitives had to\r\ncontend with.\r\n\r\nFrom one of the leading daily journals of Philadelphia, we copy as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"There can be no difference of opinion concerning the shocking\r\n    affair which occurred at Christiana, on Thursday, the resisting\r\n    of a law of Congress by a band of armed negroes, whereby the\r\n    majesty of the Government was defied and life taken in one and\r\n    the same act. There is something more than a mere ordinary,\r\n    something more than even a murderous, riot in all this. It is an\r\n    act of insurrection, we might, considering the peculiar class\r\n    and condition of the guilty parties, almost call it a servile\r\n    insurrection--if not also one of treason. Fifty, eighty, or a\r\n    hundred persons, whether white or black, who are deliberately in\r\n    arms for the purpose of resisting the law, even the law for the\r\n    recovery of fugitive slaves, are in the attitude of levying war\r\n    against the United States; and doubly heavy becomes the crime of\r\n    murder in such a case, and doubly serious the accountability of\r\n    all who have any connection with the act as advisers,\r\n    suggesters, countenancers, or accessories in any way whatever.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn those days, the paper from which this extract is taken, represented\r\nthe Whig party and the more moderate and respectable class of citizens.\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from a leading democratic organ of\r\nPhiladelphia:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"We will not, however, insult the reader by arguing that which\r\n    has not been heretofore doubted, and which is not doubted now,\r\n    by ten honest men in the State, and that is that the\r\n    abolitionists are implicated in the Christiana murder. All the\r\n    ascertained facts go to show that they were the real, if not the\r\n    chief instigators. White men are known to harbor fugitives, in\r\n    the neighborhood of Christiana, and these white men are known to\r\n    be abolitionists, known to be opposed to the Fugitive Slave Law,\r\n    and _known_ to be the warm friends of William F. Johnston,\r\n    (Governor of the State of Pennsylvania). And, as if to clinch\r\n    the argument, no less than three white men are now in the\r\n    Lancaster prison, and were arrested as accomplices in the\r\n    dreadful affair on the morning of the eleventh. And one of these\r\n    white men was committed on a charge of high treason, on Saturday\r\n    last, by United States Commissioner Ingraham.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother daily paper of opposite politics thus spake:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The unwarrantable outrage committed last week, at Christiana,\r\n    Lancaster county, is a foul stain upon the fair name and fame of\r\n    our State. We are pleased to see that the officers of the\r\n    Federal and State Governments are upon the tracks of those who\r\n    were engaged in the riot, and that several arrests have been\r\n    made.\r\n\r\n    We do not wish to see the poor misled blacks who participated in\r\n    the affair, suffer to any great extent, for they were but tools.\r\n    The men who are really chargeable with treason against the\r\n    United States Government, and with the death of Mr. Gorsuch, an\r\n    estimable citizen of Maryland, are unquestionably _white_, with\r\n    hearts black enough to incite them to the commission of any\r\n    crime equal in atrocity to that committed in Lancaster county.\r\n    Pennsylvania has now but one course to pursue, and that is to\r\n    aid, and warmly aid, the United States in bringing to condign\r\n    punishment, every man engaged in the riot. She owes it to\r\n    herself and to the Union. Let her in this resolve, be just and\r\n    fearless.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a leading neutral daily paper the following is taken: \"One would\r\nsuppose from the advice of forcible resistance, so familiarly given by\r\nthe abolitionists, that they are quite unaware that there is any such\r\ncrime as treason recognized by the Constitution, or punished with death\r\nby the laws of the United States. We would remind them, that not only is\r\nthere such a crime, but that there is a solemn decision of the Supreme\r\nCourt, that all who are concerned in a conspiracy which ripens into\r\ntreason, whether present or absent from the scene of actual violence,\r\nare involved in the same liabilities as the immediate actors. If they\r\nengage in the conspiracy and stimulate the treason, they may keep their\r\nbodies from the affray without saving their necks from a halter.\r\n\r\nIt would be very much to the advantage of society, if an example could\r\nbe made of some of these persistent agitators, who excite the ignorant\r\nand reckless to treasonable violence, from which they themselves shrink,\r\nbut who are, not only in morals, but in law, equally guilty and equally\r\namenable to punishment with the victims of their inflammatory counsels.\"\r\n\r\nA number of the most influential citizens represented the occurrence to\r\nthe Governor as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"To the Governor of Pennsylvania:\r\n\r\n    The undersigned, citizens of Pennsylvania, respectfully\r\n    represent:\r\n\r\n    That citizens of a neighboring State have been cruelly\r\n    assassinated by a band of armed outlaws at a place not more than\r\n    three hours' journey distant from the seat of Government and\r\n    from the commercial metropolis of the State:\r\n\r\n    That this insurrectionary movement in one of the most populous\r\n    parts of the State has been so far successful as to overawe the\r\n    local ministers of justice and paralyze the power of the law:\r\n\r\n    That your memorialists are not aware that 'any military force'\r\n    has been sent to the seat of insurrection, or that the civil\r\n    authority has been strengthened by the adoption of any measures\r\n    suited to the momentous crisis.\r\n\r\n    They, therefore, respectfully request the chief executive\r\n    magistrate of Pennsylvania to take into consideration the\r\n    necessity of vindicating the outraged laws, and sustaining the\r\n    dignity of the Commonwealth on this important and melancholy\r\n    occasion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder this high pressure of public excitement, threatening and alarm\r\nbreathed so freely on every hand, that fugitive slaves and their friends\r\nin this region of Pennsylvania at least, were compelled to pass through\r\nan hour of dreadful darkness--an ordeal extremely trying. The\r\nauthorities of the United States, as well as the authorities of the\r\nState of Pennsylvania and Maryland, were diligently making arrests\r\nwherever a suspected party could be found, who happened to belong in the\r\nneighborhood of Christiana.\r\n\r\nIn a very short time the following persons were in custody: J. Castner\r\nHanaway, Elijah Lewis, Joseph Scarlett, Samuel Kendig, Henry Spins,\r\nGeorge Williams, Charles Hunter, Wilson Jones, Francis Harkins, Benjamin\r\nThomson, William Brown (No. 1), William Brown (No. 2), John Halliday,\r\nElizabeth Mosey, John Morgan, Joseph Berry, John Norton, Denis Smith,\r\nHarvey Scott, Susan Clark, Tansy Brown, Eliza Brown, Eliza Parker,\r\nHannah Pinckney, Robert Johnson, Miller Thompson, Isaiah Clark, and\r\nJonathan Black.\r\n\r\nThese were not all, but sufficed for a beginning; at least it made an\r\ninteresting entertainment for the first day's examination; and although\r\nthere were two or three non-resistant Quakers, and a number of poor\r\ndefenceless colored women among those thus taken as prisoners, still it\r\nseemed utterly impossible for the exasperated defenders of Slavery to\r\ndivest themselves of the idea, that this heroic deed, in self-defence,\r\non the part of men who felt that their liberties were in danger, was\r\nanything less than actually levying war against the United States.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, therefore, the hearing gravely took place at Lancaster. On\r\nthe side of the Commonwealth, the following distinguished counsel\r\nappeared on examination: Hon. John L. Thompson, District Attorney; Wm.\r\nB. Faulney, Esq.; Thos. E. Franklin, Esq., Attorney-General of Lancaster\r\ncounty; George L. Ashmead, Esq., of Philadelphia, representative of the\r\nUnited States authorities; and Hon. Robert Brent, Attorney-General of\r\nMaryland.\r\n\r\nFor the defence--Hon. Thaddeus Stevens, Reah Frazer, Messrs. Ford,\r\nCline, and Dickey, Esquires.\r\n\r\nFrom a report of the first day's hearing we copy a short extract, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The excitement at Christiana, during yesterday, was very great.\r\n    Several hundred persons were present, and the deepest feeling\r\n    was manifested against the perpetrators of the outrage. At two\r\n    o'clock yesterday afternoon, the United States Marshal, Mr.\r\n    Roberts, United States District Attorney, J.H. Ashmead, Esq.,\r\n    Mr. Commissioner Ingraham, and Recorder Lee, accompanied by the\r\n    United States Marines, returned to the city. Lieut. Johnson, and\r\n    officers Lewis S. Brest, Samuel Mitchell, Charles McCully,\r\n    Samuel Neff, Jacob Albright, Robert McEwen, and ---- Perkenpine,\r\n    by direction of the United States Marshal, had charge of the\r\n    following named prisoners, who were safely lodged in Moyamensing\r\n    prison, accompanied by the Marines:--Joseph Scarlett, (white),\r\n    William Brown, Ezekiel Thompson, Isaiah Clarkson, Daniel\r\n    Caulsberry, Benjamin Pendergrass, Elijah Clark, George W.H.\r\n    Scott, Miller Thompson, and Samuel Hanson, all colored. The last\r\n    three were placed in the debtors' apartment, and the others in\r\n    the criminal apartment of the Moyamensing prison to await their\r\n    trial for treason, &c.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn alluding to the second day's doings, the Philadelphia Ledger thus\r\nrepresented matters at the field of battle:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The intelligence received last evening, represents the country\r\n    for miles around, to be in as much excitement as at any time\r\n    since the horrible deed was committed. The officers sent there\r\n    at the instance of the proper authorities are making diligent\r\n    search in every direction, and securing every person against\r\n    whom the least suspicion is attached. The police force from this\r\n    city, amounting to about sixty men, are under the marshalship of\r\n    Lieut. Ellis. Just as the cars started east, in the afternoon,\r\n    five more prisoners who were secured at a place called the Welsh\r\n    Mountains, twelve miles distant, were brought into Christiana.\r\n    They were placed in custody until such time as a hearing will\r\n    take place.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the government had summoned its ablest legal talent and the\r\npopular sentiment was as a hundred to one against William Parker and his\r\nbrave comrades who had made the slave-hunter \"bite the dust,\" most nobly\r\ndid Thaddeus Stevens prove that he was not to be cowed, that he believed\r\nin the stirring sentiment so much applauded by the American people,\r\n\"Give me liberty, or give me death,\" not only for the white man but for\r\nall men. Thus standing upon such great and invulnerable principles, it\r\nwas soon discovered that one could chase a thousand, and two put ten\r\nthousand to flight in latter as well as in former times.\r\n\r\nAt first even the friends of freedom thought that the killing of Gorsuch\r\nwas not only wrong, but unfortunate for the cause. Scarcely a week\r\npassed, however, before the matter was looked upon in a far different\r\nlight, and it was pretty generally thought that, if the Lord had not a\r\ndirect hand in it, the cause of Freedom at least would be greatly\r\nbenefited thereby.\r\n\r\nAnd just in proportion as the masses cried, Treason! Treason! the hosts\r\nof freedom from one end of the land to the other were awakened to\r\nsympathize with the slave. Thousands were soon aroused to show sympathy\r\nwho had hitherto been dormant. Hundreds visited the prisoners in their\r\ncells to greet, cheer, and offer them aid and counsel in their hour of\r\nsore trial.\r\n\r\nThe friends of freedom remained calm even while the pro-slavery party\r\nwere fiercely raging and gloating over the prospect, as they evidently\r\nthought of the satisfaction to be derived from teaching the\r\nabolitionists a lesson from the scaffold, which would in future prevent\r\nUnderground Rail Road passengers from killing their masters when in\r\npursuit of them.\r\n\r\nThrough the efforts of the authorities three white men, and twenty-seven\r\ncolored had been safely lodged in Moyamensing prison, under the charge\r\nof treason. The authorities, however, had utterly failed to catch the\r\nhero, William Parker, as he had been sent to Canada, _viâ_ the\r\nUnderground Rail Road, and was thus \"sitting under his own vine and fig\r\ntree, where none dared to molest, or make him afraid.\"\r\n\r\nAs an act of simple justice it may here be stated that the abolitionists\r\nand prisoners found a true friend and ally at least in one United States\r\nofficial, who, by the way, figured prominently in making arrests, etc.,\r\nnamely: the United States Marshal, A.E. Roberts. In all his intercourse\r\nwith the prisoners and their friends, he plainly showed that all his\r\nsympathies were on the side of Freedom, and not with the popular\r\npro-slavery sentiment which clamored so loudly against traitors and\r\nabolitionists.\r\n\r\nTwo of his prisoners had been identified in the jail as fugitive slaves\r\nby their owners. When the trial came on these two individuals were among\r\nthe missing. How they escaped was unknown; the Marshal, however, was\r\nstrongly suspected of being a friend of the Underground Rail Road, and\r\nto add now, that those suspicions were founded on fact, will, doubtless,\r\ndo him no damage.\r\n\r\nIn order to draw the contrast between Freedom and Slavery, simply with a\r\nview of showing how the powers that were acted and judged in the days of\r\nthe reign of the Fugitive Slave Law, unquestionably nothing better could\r\nbe found to meet the requirements of this issue than the charge of Judge\r\nKane, coupled with the indictment of the Grand Jury. In the light of the\r\nEmancipation and the Fifteenth Amendment, they are too transparent to\r\nneed a single word of comment. Judge and jury having found the accused\r\nchargeable with Treason, nothing remained, so far as the men were\r\nconcerned, but to bide their time as best they could in prison. Most of\r\nthem were married, and had wives and children clinging to them in this\r\nhour of fearful looking for of judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAW OF TREASON, AS LAID DOWN BY JUDGE KANE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following charge to the Grand Jury of the United States District\r\nCourt, in reference to the Slave-hunting affray in Lancaster county, and\r\npreparatory to their finding bills of indictment against the prisoners,\r\nwas delivered on Monday, September 28, by Judge Kane:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Gentlemen of the Grand Jury:--It has been represented to me,\r\n    that since we met last, circumstances have occurred in one of\r\n    the neighboring counties in our District, which should call for\r\n    your prompt scrutiny, and perhaps for the energetic action of\r\n    the Court. It is said, that a citizen of the State of Maryland,\r\n    who had come into Pennsylvania to reclaim a fugitive from labor,\r\n    was forcibly obstructed in the attempt by a body of armed men,\r\n    assaulted, beaten and murdered; that some members of his family,\r\n    who had accompanied him in the pursuit, were at the same time,\r\n    and by the same party maltreated and grievously wounded; and\r\n    that an officer of justice, constituted under the authority of\r\n    this Court, who sought to arrest the fugitive, was impeded and\r\n    repelled by menaces and violence, while proclaiming his\r\n    character, and exhibiting his warrant. It is said, too, that the\r\n    time and manner of these outrages, their asserted object, the\r\n    denunciations by which they were preceded, and the simultaneous\r\n    action of most of the guilty parties, evinced a combined purpose\r\n    forcibly to resist and make nugatory a constitutional provision,\r\n    and the statutes enacted in pursuance of it: and it is added, in\r\n    confirmation of this, that for some months back, gatherings of\r\n    people, strangers, as well as citizens, have been held from time\r\n    to time in the vicinity of the place of the recent outbreaks, at\r\n    which exhortations were made and pledges interchanged to hold\r\n    the law for the recovery of fugitive slaves as of no validity,\r\n    and to defy its execution. Such are some of the representations\r\n    that have been made in my hearing, and in regard to which, it\r\n    has become your duty, as the Grand Inquest of the District, to\r\n    make legal inquiry. Personally, I know nothing of the facts, or\r\n    the evidence relating to them. As a member of the Court, before\r\n    which the accused persons may hereafter be arraigned and tried,\r\n    I have sought to keep my mind altogether free from any\r\n    impressions of their guilt or innocence, and even from an\r\n    extra-judicial knowledge of the circumstances which must\r\n    determine the legal character of the offence that has thus been\r\n    perpetrated. It is due to the great interests of public justice,\r\n    no less than to the parties implicated in a criminal charge,\r\n    that their cause should be in no wise and in no degree\r\n    prejudged. And in referring, therefore, to the representations\r\n    which have been made to me, I have no other object than to point\r\n    you to the reasons for my addressing you at this advanced period\r\n    of our sessions, and to enable you to apply with more facility\r\n    and certainty the principles and rules of law, which I shall\r\n    proceed to lay before you.\r\n\r\n    If the circumstances, to which I have adverted, have in fact\r\n    taken place, they involve the highest crime known to our laws.\r\n    Treason against the United States is defined by the\r\n    Constitution, Art. 3, Sec. 3, cl. 1, to consist in \"levying war\r\n    against them, or adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and\r\n    comfort.\" This definition is borrowed from the ancient Law of\r\n    England, Stat. 25, Edw. 3, Stat. 5, Chap. 2, and its terms must\r\n    be understood, of course, in the sense which they bore in that\r\n    law, and which obtained here when the Constitution was adopted.\r\n    The expression, \"levying war,\" so regarded, embraces not merely\r\n    the act of formal or declared war, but any combination forcibly\r\n    to prevent or oppose the execution or enforcement of a provision\r\n    of the Constitution, or of a public Statute, if accompanied or\r\n    followed by an act of forcible opposition in pursuance of such\r\n    combination. This, in substance, has been the interpretation\r\n    given to these words by the English Judges, and it has been\r\n    uniformly and fully recognized and adopted in the Courts of the\r\n    United States. (See Foster, Hale, and Hawkins, and the opinions\r\n    of Iredell, Patterson, Chase, Marshall, and Washington, J.J., of\r\n    the Supreme Court, and of Peters, D.J., in U.S. vs. Vijol, U.S.\r\n    vs. Mitchell, U.S. vs. Fries, U.S. vs. Bollman and Swartwout,\r\n    and U.S. vs. Burr).\r\n\r\n    The definition, as you will observe, includes two particulars,\r\n    both of them indispensable elements of the offence. There must\r\n    have been a combination or conspiring together to oppose the law\r\n    by force, and some actual force must have been exerted, or the\r\n    crime of treason is not consummated. The highest, or at least\r\n    the direct proof of the combination may be found in the declared\r\n    purposes of the individual party before the actual outbreak; or\r\n    it may be derived from the proceedings of meetings, in which he\r\n    took part openly; or which he either prompted, or made effective\r\n    by his countenance or sanction,--commending, counselling and\r\n    instigating forcible resistance to the law. I speak, of course,\r\n    of a conspiring to resist a law, not the more limited purpose to\r\n    violate it, or to prevent its application and enforcement in a\r\n    particular case, or against a particular individual. The\r\n    combination must be directed against the law itself. But such\r\n    direct proof of this element of the offence is not legally\r\n    necessary to establish its existence. The concert of purpose may\r\n    be deduced from the concerted action itself, or it may be\r\n    inferred from facts occurring at the time, or afterwards, as\r\n    well as before. Besides this, there must be some act of\r\n    violence, as the result or consequence of the combining.\r\n\r\n    But here again, it is not necessary to prove that the individual\r\n    accused was a direct, personal actor in the violence. If he was\r\n    present, directing, aiding, abetting, counselling, or\r\n    countenancing it, he is in law guilty of the forcible act. Nor\r\n    is even his personal presence indispensable. Though he be absent\r\n    at the time of its actual perpetration, yet, if he directed the\r\n    act, devised, or knowingly furnished the means for carrying it\r\n    into effect, instigated others to perform it, he shares their\r\n    guilt.\r\n\r\n    In treason there are no accessories. There has been, I fear, an\r\n    erroneous impression on this subject, among a portion of our\r\n    people. If it has been thought safe, to counsel and instigate\r\n    others to acts of forcible oppugnation to the provisions of a\r\n    statute, to inflame the minds of the ignorant by appeals to\r\n    passion, and denunciations of the law as oppressive, unjust,\r\n    revolting to the conscience, and not binding on the actions of\r\n    men, to represent the constitution of the land as a compact of\r\n    iniquity, which it were meritorious to violate or subvert, the\r\n    mistake has been a grievous one; and they who have fallen into\r\n    it may rejoice, if peradventure their appeals and their counsels\r\n    have been hitherto without effect. The supremacy of the\r\n    constitution, in all its provisions, is at the very basis of our\r\n    existence as a nation. He, whose conscience, or whose theories\r\n    of political or individual right, forbid him to support and\r\n    maintain it in its fullest integrity, may relieve himself from\r\n    the duties of citizenship, by divesting himself of its rights.\r\n    But while he remains within our borders, he is to remember, that\r\n    successfully to instigate treason, is to commit it. I shall not\r\n    be supposed to imply in these remarks, that I have doubts of the\r\n    law-abiding character of our people. No one can know them well,\r\n    without the most entire reliance on their fidelity to the\r\n    constitution. Some of them may differ from the mass, as to the\r\n    rightfulness or the wisdom of this or the other provision that\r\n    is found in the federal compact, they may be divided in\r\n    sentiment as to the policy of a particular statute, or of some\r\n    provision in a statute; but it is their honest purpose to stand\r\n    by the engagements, all the engagements, which bind them to\r\n    their brethren of the other States. They have but one country;\r\n    they recognize no law of higher social obligation than its\r\n    constitution and the laws made in pursuance of it; they\r\n    recognize no higher appeal than to the tribunals it has\r\n    appointed; they cherish no patriotism that looks beyond the\r\n    union of the States. That there are men here, as elsewhere, whom\r\n    a misguided zeal impels to violations of law; that there are\r\n    others who are controlled by false sympathies, and some who\r\n    yield too readily and too fully to sympathies not always false,\r\n    or if false, yet pardonable, and become criminal by yielding,\r\n    that we have, not only in our jails and almshouses, but\r\n    segregated here and there in detached portions of the State,\r\n    ignorant men, many of them without political rights, degraded in\r\n    social position, and instinctive of revolt, all this is true. It\r\n    is proved by the daily record of our police courts, and by the\r\n    ineffective labors of those good men among us, who seek to\r\n    detach want from temptation, passion from violence, and\r\n    ignorance from crime.\r\n\r\n    But it should not be supposed that any of these represent the\r\n    sentiment of Pennsylvania, and it would be to wrong our people\r\n    sorely, to include them in the same category of personal,\r\n    social, or political morals. It is declared in the article of\r\n    the constitution, which I have already cited, that 'no person\r\n    shall be convicted of treason, unless on the testimony of two\r\n    witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open\r\n    court.' This and the corresponding language in the act of\r\n    Congress of the 30th of April, 1790, seem to refer to the proofs\r\n    on the trial, and not to the preliminary hearing before the\r\n    committing magistrate, or the proceeding before the grand\r\n    inquest. There can be no conviction until after arraignment on\r\n    bill found. The previous action in the case is not a trial, and\r\n    cannot convict, whatever be the evidence or the number of\r\n    witnesses. I understand this to have been the opinion\r\n    entertained by Chief Justice Marshall, 1 Burr's Trial, 195, and\r\n    though it differs from that expressed by Judge Iredell on the\r\n    indictment of Fries, (1 Whart. Am. St. Tr. 480), I feel\r\n    authorized to recommend it to you, as within the terms of the\r\n    Constitution, and involving no injustice to the accused. I have\r\n    only to add that treason against the United States, may be\r\n    committed by any one resident or sojourning within its\r\n    territory, and under the protection of its laws, whether he be a\r\n    citizen or an alien. (Fost. C.L. 183, 5.--1 Hale 59, 60, 62. 1\r\n    Hawk. ch. 17, § 5, Kel. 38).\r\n\r\n    Besides the crime of treason, which I have thus noticed, there\r\n    are offences of minor grades, against the Constitution and the\r\n    State, some or other of which may be apparently established by\r\n    the evidence that will come before you. These are embraced in\r\n    the act of Congress, on the 30th of Sept., 1790, Ch. 9, Sec. 22,\r\n    on the subject of obstructing or resisting the service of legal\r\n    process,--the act of the 2d of March, 1831, Chap. 99, Sec. 2,\r\n    which secures the jurors, witnesses, and officers of our Courts\r\n    in the fearless, free, and impartial administration of their\r\n    respective functions,--and the act of the 18th of September,\r\n    1850, Ch. 60, which relates more particularly to the rescue, or\r\n    attempted rescue of a fugitive from labor. These Acts were made\r\n    the subject of a charge to the Grand Jury of this Court in\r\n    November last, of which I shall direct a copy to be laid before\r\n    you; and I do not deem it necessary to repeat their provisions\r\n    at this time.\r\n\r\n    Gentlemen of the Grand Jury: You are about to enter upon a most\r\n    grave and momentous duty. You will be careful in performing it,\r\n    not to permit your indignation against crime, or your just\r\n    appreciation of its perilous consequences, to influence your\r\n    judgment of the guilt of those who may be charged before you\r\n    with its commission. But you will be careful, also, that no\r\n    misguided charity shall persuade you to withhold the guilty from\r\n    the retributions of justice. You will inquire whether an offence\r\n    has been committed, what was its legal character, and who were\r\n    the offenders,--and this done, and this only, you will make your\r\n    presentments according to the evidence and the law. Your\r\n    inquiries will not be restricted to the conduct of the people\r\n    belonging to our own State. If in the progress of them, you\r\n    shall find, that men have been among us, who, under whatever\r\n    mask of conscience or of peace, have labored to incite others to\r\n    treasonable violence, and who, after arranging the elements of\r\n    the mischief, have withdrawn themselves to await the explosion\r\n    they had contrived, you will feel yourselves bound to present\r\n    the fact to the Court,--and however distant may be the place in\r\n    which the offenders may have sought refuge, we give you the\r\n    pledge of the law, that its far-reaching energies shall be\r\n    exerted to bring them up for trial,--if guilty, to punishment.\r\n    The offence of treason is not triable in this Court; but by an\r\n    act of Congress, passed on the 8th of August, 1845, Chap. 98, it\r\n    is made lawful for the Grand Jury, empanelled and sworn in the\r\n    District Court, to take cognizance of all the indictments for\r\n    crimes against the United States within the jurisdiction of\r\n    either of the Federal Courts of the District. There being no\r\n    Grand Jury in attendance at this time in the Circuit Court, to\r\n    pass upon the accusations I have referred to in the first\r\n    instance, it has fallen to my lot to assume the responsible\r\n    office of expounding to you the law in regard to them. I have\r\n    the satisfaction of knowing, that if the views I have expressed\r\n    are in any respect erroneous, they must undergo the revision of\r\n    my learned brother of the Supreme Court, who presides in this\r\n    Circuit, before they can operate to the serious prejudice of any\r\n    one; and that if they are doubtful even, provision exists for\r\n    their re-examination in the highest tribunal of the country.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the strength of Judge Kane's carefully-drawn up charge the Grand Jury\r\nfound true bills of indictment against forty of the Christiana\r\noffenders, charged with treason. James Jackson, an aged member of the\r\nSociety of Friends (a Quaker), and a well-known non-resistant\r\nabolitionist, was of this number. With his name the blanks were filled\r\nup; the same form (with regard to these bills) was employed in the case\r\nof each one of the accused. The following is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPY OF THE INDICTMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Eastern District of Pennsylvania, ss.:\r\n\r\n    The Grand Inquest of the United States of America, inquiring for\r\n    the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, on their oaths and\r\n    affirmations, respectfully do present, that James Jackson,\r\n    yeoman of the District aforesaid, owing allegiance to the United\r\n    States of America, wickedly devising and intending the peace and\r\n    tranquility of said United States, to disturb, and prevent the\r\n    execution of the laws thereof within the same, to wit, a law of\r\n    the United States, entitled \"An act respecting fugitives from\r\n    justice and persons escaping from the service of their masters,\"\r\n    approved February twelfth, one thousand seven hundred and\r\n    ninety-three, and also a law of the United States, entitled \"An\r\n    act to amend, and supplementary to, the act entitled, An act\r\n    respecting fugitives from justice and persons escaping from the\r\n    service of their masters, approved February the twelfth, one\r\n    thousand seven hundred and ninety-three,\" which latter\r\n    supplementary act was approved September eighteenth, one\r\n    thousand eight hundred and fifty, on the eleventh day of\r\n    September, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred\r\n    and fifty-one, in the county of Lancaster, in the State of\r\n    Pennsylvania and District aforesaid, and within the jurisdiction\r\n    of this Court, wickedly and traitorously did intend to levy war\r\n    against the United States within the same. And to fulfill and\r\n    bring to effect the said traitorous intention of him, the said\r\n    James Jackson, he, the said James Jackson afterward, to wit, on\r\n    the day and year aforesaid, in the State, District and County\r\n    aforesaid, and within the jurisdiction of this Court, with a\r\n    great multitude of persons, whose names, to this Inquest are as\r\n    yet unknown, to a great number, to wit, to the number of one\r\n    hundred persons and upwards, armed and arrayed in a warlike\r\n    manner, that is to say, with guns, swords, and other warlike\r\n    weapons, as well offensive as defensive, being then and there\r\n    unlawfully and traitorously assembled, did traitorously assemble\r\n    and combine against the said United States, and then and there,\r\n    with force and arms, wickedly and traitorously, and with the\r\n    wicked and traitorous intention to oppose and prevent, by means\r\n    of intimidation and violence, the execution of the said laws of\r\n    the United States within the same, did array and dispose\r\n    themselves in a warlike and hostile manner against the said\r\n    United States, and then and there, with force and arms, in\r\n    pursuance of such their traitorous intention, he, the said James\r\n    Jackson, with the said persons so as aforesaid, wickedly and\r\n    traitorously did levy war against the United States.\r\n\r\n    And further, to fulfill and bring to effect the said traitorous\r\n    intention of him, the said James Jackson, and in pursuance and\r\n    in execution of the said wicked and traitorous combination to\r\n    oppose, resist and prevent the said laws of the United States\r\n    from being carried into execution, he, the said James Jackson,\r\n    afterwards, to wit, on the day and year first aforesaid, in the\r\n    State, District and county aforesaid, and within the\r\n    jurisdiction aforesaid, with the said persons whose names to\r\n    this Inquest are as yet unknown, did, wickedly and traitorously\r\n    assemble against the said United States, with the avowed\r\n    intention by force of arms and intimidation to prevent the\r\n    execution of the said laws of the United States within the same;\r\n    and in pursuance and execution of such their wicked and\r\n    traitorous combination, he, the said James Jackson, then and\r\n    there with force and arms, with the said persons to a great\r\n    number, to wit, the number of one hundred persons and upwards,\r\n    armed and arrayed in a warlike manner, that is to say, with\r\n    guns, swords, and other warlike weapons, as well offensive as\r\n    defensive, being then and there, unlawfully and traitorously\r\n    assembled, did wickedly, knowingly, and traitorously resist and\r\n    oppose one Henry H. Kline, an officer, duly appointed by Edward\r\n    D. Ingraham, Esq., a commissioner, duly appointed by the Circuit\r\n    Court of the United States, for the said district, in the\r\n    execution of the duty of the office of the said Kline, he, the\r\n    said Kline, being appointed by the said Edward Ingraham, Esq.,\r\n    by writing under his hand, to execute warrants and other process\r\n    issued by him, the said Ingraham, in the performance of his\r\n    duties as Commissioner, under the said laws of the United\r\n    States, and then and there, with force and arms, with the said\r\n    great multitude of persons, so as, aforesaid, unlawfully and\r\n    traitorously assembled, and armed and arrayed in manner as\r\n    aforesaid, he, the said, James Jackson, wickedly and\r\n    traitorously did oppose and resist, and prevent the said Kline,\r\n    from executing the lawful process to him directed and delivered\r\n    by the said commissioner against sundry persons, then residents\r\n    of said county, who had been legally charged before the said\r\n    commissioner as being persons held to service or labor in the\r\n    State of Maryland, and owing such service or labor to a certain\r\n    Edward Gorsuch, under the laws of the said State of Maryland,\r\n    had escaped therefrom, into the said Eastern district of\r\n    Pennsylvania; which process, duly issued by the said\r\n    commissioner, the said Kline then and there had in his\r\n    possession, and was then and there proceeding to execute, as by\r\n    law he was bound to do; and so the grand inquest, upon their\r\n    respective oaths and affirmations aforesaid, do say, that the\r\n    said James Jackson, in manner aforesaid, as much as in him lay,\r\n    wickedly and traitorously did prevent, by means of force and\r\n    intimidation, the execution of the said laws of the United\r\n    States, in the said State and District. And further, to fulfill\r\n    and bring to effect, the said traitorous intention of him, the\r\n    said James Jackson, and in further pursuance, and in the\r\n    execution of the said wicked and traitorous combination to\r\n    expose, resist, and prevent the execution of the said laws of\r\n    the said United States, in the State and District aforesaid, he,\r\n    the said James Jackson, afterwards, to wit, on the day and year\r\n    first aforesaid, in the State, county, and district aforesaid,\r\n    and within the jurisdiction of this court, with the said persons\r\n    whose names to the grand inquest aforesaid, are as yet unknown,\r\n    did, wickedly and traitorously assemble against the said United\r\n    States with the avowed intention, by means of force and\r\n    intimidation, to prevent the execution of the said laws of the\r\n    United States in the State and district aforesaid, and in\r\n    pursuance and execution of such, their wicked and traitorous\r\n    combination and intention, then and there to the State,\r\n    district, and county aforesaid, and within the jurisdiction of\r\n    this court, with force and arms, with a great multitude of\r\n    persons, to wit, the number of one hundred persons and upwards,\r\n    armed and arrayed in a warlike manner, that is to say, with\r\n    guns, swords, and other warlike weapons, as well offensive as\r\n    defensive, being then and there unlawfully and traitorously\r\n    assembled, he, the said James Jackson, did, knowingly, and\r\n    unlawfully assault the said Henry H. Kline, he, the said Kline,\r\n    being an officer appointed by writing, under the hand of the\r\n    said Edward D. Ingraham, Esq., a commissioner under said laws,\r\n    to execute warrants and other process, issued by the said\r\n    commissioner in the performance of his duties as such; and he,\r\n    the said James Jackson, did, then and there, traitorously, with\r\n    force and arms, against the will of the said Kline, liberate and\r\n    take out of his custody, persons by him before that time\r\n    arrested, and in his lawful custody, then and there being, by\r\n    virtue of lawful process against them issued by the said\r\n    commissioner, they being legally charged with being persons held\r\n    to service or labor in the State of Maryland, and owing such\r\n    service or labor to a certain Edward Gorsuch, under the laws of\r\n    the said State of Maryland, who had escaped therefrom into the\r\n    said district; and so the grand inquest aforesaid, upon their\r\n    oaths and affirmations, aforesaid, do say, that he, the said\r\n    James Jackson, as much as in him lay, did, then and there, in\r\n    pursuance and in execution of the said wicked and traitorous\r\n    combination and intention, wickedly and traitorously, by means\r\n    of force and intimidation, prevent the execution of the said\r\n    laws of the United States, in the said State and district.\r\n\r\n    And further to fulfill and bring to effect, the said traitorous\r\n    intention of him, the said James Jackson, and in pursuance and\r\n    in execution of the said wicked and traitorous combination to\r\n    oppose, resist and prevent the said laws of the United States\r\n    from being carried into execution, he, the said James Jackson,\r\n    afterwards, to wit, on the day and year first aforesaid, and on\r\n    divers other days, both before and afterwards in the State and\r\n    district aforesaid, and within the jurisdiction of this court,\r\n    with the said persons to this inquest as yet unknown,\r\n    maliciously and traitorously did meet, conspire, consult, and\r\n    agree among themselves, further to oppose, resist, and prevent,\r\n    by means of force and intimidation, the execution of the said\r\n    laws herein before specified.\r\n\r\n    And further to fulfill, perfect, and bring to effect the said\r\n    traitorous intention of him the said James Jackson, and in\r\n    pursuance and execution of the said wicked and traitorous\r\n    combination to oppose and resist the said laws of the United\r\n    States from being carried into execution, in the State and\r\n    district aforesaid, he, the said James Jackson, together with\r\n    the other persons whose names are to this inquest as yet\r\n    unknown, on the day and year first aforesaid, and on divers\r\n    other days and times, as well before and after, at the district\r\n    aforesaid, within the jurisdiction of said court, with force and\r\n    arms, maliciously and traitorously did prepare and compose, and\r\n    did then and there maliciously and traitorously cause and\r\n    procure to be prepared and composed, divers books, pamphlets,\r\n    letters, declarations, resolutions, addresses, papers and\r\n    writings, and did then and there maliciously and traitorously\r\n    publish and disperse and cause to be published and dispersed,\r\n    divers other books and pamphlets, letters, declarations,\r\n    resolutions, addresses, papers and writings; the said books,\r\n    pamphlets, letters, declarations, resolutions, addresses, papers\r\n    and writings, so respectively prepared, composed, published and\r\n    dispersed, as last aforesaid, containing therein, amongst other\r\n    things, incitements, encouragements, and exhortations, to move,\r\n    induce and persuade persons held to service in any of the United\r\n    States, by the laws thereof, who had escaped into the said\r\n    district, as well as other persons, citizens of said district,\r\n    to resist, oppose, and prevent, by violence and intimidation,\r\n    the execution of the said laws, and also containing therein,\r\n    instructions and directions how and upon what occasion, the\r\n    traitorous purposes last aforesaid, should and might be carried\r\n    into effect, contrary to the form of the act of Congress in such\r\n    case made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the\r\n    United States.\r\n\r\n    JOHN W. ASHMEAD,\r\n\r\n    Attorney of the U.S. for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe abolitionists were leaving no stone unturned in order to\r\ntriumphantly meet the case in Court. During the interim many tokens of\r\nkindness and marks of Christian benevolence were extended to the\r\nprisoners by their friends and sympathizers; among these none deserve\r\nmore honorable mention than the noble act of Thomas L. Kane (son of\r\nJudge Kane, and now General), in tendering all the prisoners a sumptuous\r\nThanksgiving dinner, consisting of turkey, etc., pound cake, etc., etc.\r\nThe dinner for the white prisoners, Messrs. Hanaway, Davis, and\r\nScarlett, was served in appropriate style in the room of Mr. Morrison,\r\none of the keepers. The U.S. Marshal, A.E. Roberts, Esq., several of the\r\nkeepers, and Mr. Hanes, one of the prison officers, dined with the\r\nprisoners as their guests. Mayor Charles Gilpin was also present and\r\naccepted an invitation to test the quality of the luxuries, thus\r\nsignificantly indicating that he was not the enemy of Freedom.\r\n\r\nMrs. Martha Hanaway, the wife of the \"traitor\" of that name, and who had\r\nspent most of her time with her husband since his incarceration, served\r\neach of the twenty-seven colored \"traitors\" with a plate of the\r\ndelicacies, and the supply being greater than the demand, the balance\r\nwas served to outsiders in other cells on the same corridor.\r\n\r\nThe pro-slavery party were very indignant over the matter, and the Hon.\r\nMr. Brent thought it incumbent upon him to bring this high-handed\r\nprocedure to the notice of the Court, where he received a few crumbs of\r\nsympathy, from the pro-slavery side, of course. But the dinner had been\r\nso handsomely arranged, and coming from the source that it did, it had a\r\nvery telling effect. Long before this, however, Mr. T.L. Kane had given\r\nabundant evidence that he approved of the Underground Rail Road, and was\r\na decided opponent of the Fugitive Slave Law; in short, that he believed\r\nin freedom for all men, irrespective of race or color.\r\n\r\nCastnor Hanaway was first to be tried; over him, therefore, the great\r\ncontest was to be made. For the defence of this particular case, the\r\nabolitionists selected J.M. Read, Thaddeus Stevens, Joseph S. Lewis and\r\nTheodore Cuyler, Esqs. On the side of the Fugitive Slave Law, and\r\nagainst the \"traitors,\" were U.S. District Attorney, John W. Ashmead,\r\nHon. James Cooper, James R. Ludlow, Esq., and Robert G. Brent, Attorney\r\nGeneral of Maryland. Mr. Brent was allowed to act as \"overseer\" in\r\nconducting matters on the side of the Fugitive Slave Law. On this\r\ninfamous enactment, combined with a corrupted popular sentiment, the\r\npro-slavery side depended for success. The abolitionists viewed matters\r\nin the light of freedom and humanity, and hopefully relied upon the\r\njustice of their cause and the power of truth to overcome and swallow up\r\nall the Pharaoh's rods of serpents as fast as they might be thrown down.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners having lain in their cells nearly three months, the time\r\nfor their trial arrived. Monday morning, November 24th, the contest\r\nbegan. The first three days were occupied in procuring jurors. The\r\npro-slavery side desired none but such as believed in the Fugitive Slave\r\nlaw and in \"Treason\" as expounded in the Judge's charge and the finding\r\nof the Grand Jury.\r\n\r\nThe counsel for the \"Traitors\" carefully weighed the jurors, and when\r\nfound wanting challenged them; in so doing, they managed to get rid of\r\nmost all of that special class upon whom the prosecution depended for a\r\nconviction. The jury having been sworn in, the battle commenced in good\r\nearnest, and continued unabated for nearly two weeks. It is needless to\r\nsay, that the examinations and arguments would fill volumes, and were of\r\nthe most deeply interesting nature.\r\n\r\nNo attempt can here be made to recite the particulars of the trial other\r\nthan by a mere reference. It was, doubtless, the most important trial\r\nthat ever took place in this country relative to the Underground Rail\r\nRoad passengers, and in its results more good was brought out of evil\r\nthan can easily be estimated. The pro-slavery theories of treason were\r\nutterly demolished, and not a particle of room was left the advocates of\r\nthe peculiar institution to hope, that slave-hunters in future, in quest\r\nof fugitives, would be any more safe than Gorsuch. The tide of public\r\nsentiment changed--Hanaway, and the other \"traitors,\" began to be looked\r\nupon as having been greatly injured, and justly entitled to public\r\nsympathy and honor, while confusion of face, disappointment and chagrin\r\nwere plainly visible throughout the demoralized ranks of the enemy.\r\nHanaway was victorious.\r\n\r\nAn effort was next made to convict Thompson, one of the colored\r\n\"traitors.\" To defend the colored prisoners, the old Abolition Society\r\nhad retained Thaddeus Stevens, David Paul Brown, William S. Pierce, and\r\nRobert P. Kane, Esqs., (son of Judge Kane). Stevens, Brown and Pierce\r\nwere well-known veterans, defenders of the slave wherever and whenever\r\ncalled upon so to do. In the present case, they were prepared for a\r\ngallant stand and a long siege against opposing forces. Likewise, R.P.\r\nKane, Esq., although a young volunteer in the anti-slavery war, brought\r\nto the work great zeal, high attainments, large sympathy and true pluck,\r\nwhile, in view of all the circumstances, the committee of arrangements\r\nfelt very much gratified to have him in their ranks.\r\n\r\nBy this time, however, the sandy foundations of \"overseer\" Brent and\r\nCo., (on the part of slavery), had been so completely swept away by the\r\nHon. J.M. Read and Co., on the side of freedom, that there was but\r\nlittle chance left to deal heavy blows upon the defeated advocates of\r\nthe Fugitive Slave Law. Thompson was pronounced \"not guilty.\" The other\r\nprisoners, of course, shared the same good luck. The victory was then\r\ncomplete, equally as much so as at Christiana. Underground Rail Road\r\nstock arose rapidly and a feeling of universal rejoicing pervaded the\r\nfriends of freedom from one end of the country to the other.\r\n\r\nEspecially were slave-holders taught the wholesome lesson, that the\r\nFugitive Slave Law was no guarantee against \"red hot shot,\" nor the\r\ncharges of U.S. Judges and the findings of Grand Juries, together with\r\nthe superior learning of counsel from slave-holding Maryland, any\r\nguarantee that \"traitors\" would be hung. In every respect, the\r\nUnderground Rail Road made capital by the treason. Slave-holders from\r\nMaryland especially were far less disposed to hunt their runaway\r\nproperty than they had hitherto been. The Deputy Marshal likewise\r\nconsidered the business of catching slaves very unsafe.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM AND ELLEN CRAFT.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEMALE SLAVE IN MALE ATTIRE, FLEEING AS A PLANTER, WITH HER HUSBAND AS\r\nHER BODY SERVANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nA quarter of a century ago, William and Ellen Craft were slaves in the\r\nState of Georgia. With them, as with thousands of others, the desire to\r\nbe free was very strong. For this jewel they were willing to make any\r\nsacrifice, or to endure any amount of suffering. In this state of mind\r\nthey commenced planning. After thinking of various ways that might be\r\ntried, it occurred to William and Ellen, that one might act the part of\r\nmaster and the other the part of servant.\r\n\r\nEllen being fair enough to pass for white, of necessity would have to be\r\ntransformed into a young planter for the time being. All that was\r\nneeded, however, to make this important change was that she should be\r\ndressed elegantly in a fashionable suit of male attire, and have her\r\nhair cut in the style usually worn by young planters. Her profusion of\r\ndark hair offered a fine opportunity for the change. So far this plan\r\nlooked very tempting. But it occurred to them that Ellen was beardless.\r\nAfter some mature reflection, they came to the conclusion that this\r\ndifficulty could be very readily obviated by having the face muffled up\r\nas though the young planter was suffering badly with the face or\r\ntoothache; thus they got rid of this trouble. Straightway, upon further\r\nreflection, several other very serious difficulties stared them in the\r\nface. For instance, in traveling, they knew that they would be under the\r\nnecessity of stopping repeatedly at hotels, and that the custom of\r\nregistering would have to be conformed to, unless some very good excuse\r\ncould be given for not doing so.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM CRAFT]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELLEN CRAFT.]\r\n\r\nHere they again, thought much over matters, and wisely concluded that\r\nthe young man had better assume the attitude of a gentleman very much\r\nindisposed. He must have his right arm placed carefully in a sling; that\r\nwould be a sufficient excuse for not registering, etc. Then he must be a\r\nlittle lame, with a nice cane in the left hand; he must have large green\r\nspectacles over his eyes, and withal he must be very hard of hearing and\r\ndependent on his faithful servant (as was no uncommon thing with\r\nslave-holders), to look after all his wants.\r\n\r\nWilliam was just the man to act this part. To begin with, he was very\r\n\"likely-looking;\" smart, active and exceedingly attentive to his young\r\nmaster--indeed he was almost eyes, ears, hands and feet for him. William\r\nknew that this would please the slave-holders. The young planter would\r\nhave nothing to do but hold himself subject to his ailments and put on a\r\nbold air of superiority; he was not to deign to notice anybody. If,\r\nwhile traveling, gentlemen, either politely or rudely, should venture to\r\nscrape acquaintance with the young planter, in his deafness he was to\r\nremain mute; the servant was to explain. In every instance when this\r\noccurred, as it actually did, the servant was fully equal to the\r\nemergency--none dreaming of the disguises in which the Underground Rail\r\nRoad passengers were traveling.\r\n\r\nThey stopped at a first-class hotel in Charleston, where the young\r\nplanter and his body servant were treated, as the house was wont to\r\ntreat the chivalry. They stopped also at a similar hotel in Richmond,\r\nand with like results.\r\n\r\nThey knew that they must pass through Baltimore, but they did not know\r\nthe obstacles that they would have to surmount in the Monumental City.\r\nThey proceeded to the depot in the usual manner, and the servant asked\r\nfor tickets for his master and self. Of course the master could have a\r\nticket, but \"bonds will have to be entered before you can get a ticket,\"\r\nsaid the ticket master. \"It is the rule of this office to require bonds\r\nfor all negroes applying for tickets to go North, and none but gentlemen\r\nof well-known responsibility will be taken,\" further explained the\r\nticket master.\r\n\r\nThe servant replied, that he knew \"nothing about that\"--that he was\r\n\"simply traveling with his young master to take care of him--he being in\r\na very delicate state of health, so much so, that fears were entertained\r\nthat he might not be able to hold out to reach Philadelphia, where he\r\nwas hastening for medical treatment,\" and ended his reply by saying, \"my\r\nmaster can't be detained.\" Without further parley, the ticket master\r\nvery obligingly waived the old \"rule,\" and furnished the requisite\r\ntickets. The mountain being thus removed, the young planter and his\r\nfaithful servant were safely in the cars for the city of Brotherly Love.\r\n\r\nScarcely had they arrived on free soil when the rheumatism departed--the\r\nright arm was unslung--the toothache was gone--the beardless face was\r\nunmuffled--the deaf heard and spoke--the blind saw--and the lame leaped\r\nas an hart, and in the presence of a few astonished friends of the\r\nslave, the facts of this unparalleled Underground Rail Road feat were\r\nfully established by the most unquestionable evidence.\r\n\r\nThe constant strain and pressure on Ellen's nerves, however, had tried\r\nher severely, so much so, that for days afterwards, she was physically\r\nvery much prostrated, although joy and gladness beamed from her eyes,\r\nwhich bespoke inexpressible delight within.\r\n\r\nNever can the writer forget the impression made by their arrival. Even\r\nnow, after a lapse of nearly a quarter of a century, it is easy to\r\npicture them in a private room, surrounded by a few friends--Ellen in\r\nher fine suit of black, with her cloak and high-heeled boots, looking,\r\nin every respect, like a young gentleman; in an hour after having\r\ndropped her male attire, and assumed the habiliments of her sex the\r\nfeminine only was visible in every line and feature of her structure.\r\n\r\nHer husband, William, was thoroughly colored, but was a man of marked\r\nnatural abilities, of good manners, and full of pluck, and possessed of\r\nperceptive faculties very large.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary, however, in those days, that they should seek a\r\npermanent residence, where their freedom would be more secure than in\r\nPhiladelphia; therefore they were advised to go to headquarters,\r\ndirectly to Boston. There they would be safe, it was supposed, as it had\r\nthen been about a generation since a fugitive had been taken back from\r\nthe old Bay State, and through the incessant labors of William Lloyd\r\nGarrison, the great pioneer, and his faithful coadjutors, it was\r\nconceded that another fugitive slave case could never be tolerated on\r\nthe free soil of Massachusetts. So to Boston they went.\r\n\r\nOn arriving, the warm hearts of abolitionists welcomed them heartily,\r\nand greeted and cheered them without let or hindrance. They did not\r\npretend to keep their coming a secret, or hide it under a bushel; the\r\nstory of their escape was heralded broadcast over the country--North and\r\nSouth, and indeed over the civilized world. For two years or more, not\r\nthe slightest fear was entertained that they were not just as safe in\r\nBoston as if they had gone to Canada. But the day the Fugitive Bill\r\npassed, even the bravest abolitionist began to fear that a fugitive\r\nslave was no longer safe anywhere under the stars and stripes, North or\r\nSouth, and that William and Ellen Craft were liable to be captured at\r\nany moment by Georgia slave hunters. Many abolitionists counselled\r\nresistance to the death at all hazards. Instead of running to Canada,\r\nfugitives generally armed themselves and thus said, \"Give me liberty or\r\ngive me death.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam and Ellen Craft believed that it was their duty, as citizens of\r\nMassachusetts, to observe a more legal and civilized mode of conforming\r\nto the marriage rite than had been permitted them in slavery, and as\r\nTheodore Parker had shown himself a very warm friend of their's, they\r\nagreed to have their wedding over again according to the laws of a free\r\nState. After performing the ceremony, the renowned and fearless advocate\r\nof equal rights (Theodore Parker), presented William with a revolver and\r\na dirk-knife, counselling him to use them manfully in defence of his\r\nwife and himself, if ever an attempt should be made by his owners or\r\nanybody else to re-enslave them.\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding all the published declarations made by\r\nabolitionists and fugitives, to the effect, that slave-holders and\r\nslave-catchers in visiting Massachusetts in pursuit of their runaway\r\nproperty, would be met by just such weapons as Theodore Parker presented\r\nWilliam with, to the surprise of all Boston, the owners of William and\r\nEllen actually had the effrontery to attempt their recapture under the\r\nFugitive Slave Law. How it was done, and the results, taken from the\r\n_Old Liberator_, (William Lloyd Garrison's organ), we copy as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    From the \"Liberator,\" Nov. 1, 1850.\r\n\r\n    SLAVE-HUNTERS IN BOSTON.\r\n\r\n    Our city, for a week past, has been thrown into a state of\r\n    intense excitement by the appearance of two prowling villains,\r\n    named Hughes and Knight, from Macon, Georgia, for the purpose of\r\n    seizing William and Ellen Craft, under the infernal Fugitive\r\n    Slave Bill, and carrying them back to the hell of Slavery. Since\r\n    the day of '76, there has not been such a popular demonstration\r\n    on the side of human freedom in this region. The humane and\r\n    patriotic contagion has infected all classes. Scarcely any other\r\n    subject has been talked about in the streets, or in the social\r\n    circle. On Thursday, of last week, warrants for the arrest of\r\n    William and Ellen were issued by Judge Levi Woodbury, but no\r\n    officer has yet been found ready or bold enough to serve them.\r\n    In the meantime, the Vigilance Committee, appointed at the\r\n    Faneuil Hall meeting, has not been idle. Their number has been\r\n    increased to upwards of a hundred \"good men and true,\" including\r\n    some thirty or forty members of the bar; and they have been in\r\n    constant session, devising every legal method to baffle the\r\n    pursuing bloodhounds, and relieve the city of their hateful\r\n    presence. On Saturday placards were posted up in all directions,\r\n    announcing the arrival of these slave-hunters, and describing\r\n    their persons. On the same day, Hughes and Knight were arrested\r\n    on the charge of slander against William Craft. The Chronotype\r\n    says, the damages being laid at $10,000; bail was demanded in\r\n    the same sum, and was promptly furnished. By whom? is the\r\n    question. An immense crowd was assembled in front of the\r\n    Sheriff's office, while the bail matter was being arranged. The\r\n    reporters were not admitted. It was only known that Watson\r\n    Freeman, Esq., who once declared his readiness to hang any\r\n    number of negroes remarkably cheap, came in, saying that the\r\n    arrest was a shame, all a humbug, the trick of the damned\r\n    abolitionists, and proclaimed his readiness to stand bail. John\r\n    H. Pearson was also sent for, and came--the same John H.\r\n    Pearson, merchant and Southern packet agent, who immortalized\r\n    himself by sending back, on the 10th of September, 1846, in the\r\n    bark Niagara, a poor fugitive slave, who came secreted in the\r\n    brig Ottoman, from New Orleans--being himself judge, jury and\r\n    executioner, to consign a fellow-being to a life of bondage--in\r\n    obedience to the law of a slave State, and in violation of the\r\n    law of his own. This same John H. Pearson, not contented with\r\n    his previous infamy, was on hand. There is a story that the\r\n    slave-hunters have been his table-guests also, and whether he\r\n    bailed them or not, we don't know. What we know is, that soon\r\n    after Pearson came out from the back room, where he and Knight\r\n    and the Sheriff had been closeted, the Sheriff said that Knight\r\n    was bailed--he would not say by whom. Knight being looked after,\r\n    was not to be found. He had slipped out through a back door, and\r\n    thus cheated the crowd of the pleasure of greeting him--possibly\r\n    with that rough and ready affection which Barclay's brewers\r\n    bestowed upon Haynau. The escape was very fortunate every way.\r\n    Hughes and Knight have since been twice arrested and put under\r\n    bonds of $10,000 (making $30,000 in all), charged with a\r\n    conspiracy to kidnap and abduct William Craft, a peaceable\r\n    citizen of Massachusetts, etc. Bail was entered by Hamilton\r\n    Willis, of Willis & Co., 25 State street, and Patrick Riley,\r\n    U.S. Deputy Marshal.\r\n\r\n    The following (says the Chronotype), is a _verbatim et\r\n    literatim_ copy of the letter sent by Knight to Craft, to entice\r\n    him to the U.S. Hotel, in order to kidnap him. It shows, that\r\n    the school-master owes Knight more \"service and labor\" than it\r\n    is possible for Craft to:\r\n\r\n\r\n        BOSTON, Oct. 22, 1850, 11 Oclk P.M.\r\n\r\n        Wm. Craft--Sir--I have to leave so Eirley in the moring\r\n        that I cold not call according to promis, so if you want\r\n        me to carry a letter home with me, you must bring it to\r\n        the United States Hotel to morrow and leave it in box\r\n        44, or come your self to morro eavening after tea and\r\n        bring it. let me no if you come your self by sending a\r\n        note to box 44 U.S. Hotel so that I may know whether to\r\n        wate after tea or not by the Bearer.

I shall leave for home eirley a Thursday moring.\r\n        J.K.\r\n\r\n\r\n    At a meeting of colored people, held in Belknap Street Church,\r\n    on Friday evening, the following resolutions were unanimously\r\n    adopted:\r\n\r\n\r\n        _Resolved_, That God willed us free; man willed us\r\n        slaves. We will as God wills; God's will be done.\r\n\r\n        _Resolved_, That our oft repeated determination to\r\n        resist oppression is the same now as ever, and we pledge\r\n        ourselves, at all hazards, to resist unto death any\r\n        attempt upon our liberties.\r\n\r\n        _Resolved_, That as South Carolina seizes and imprisons\r\n        colored seamen from the North, under the plea that it is\r\n        to prevent insurrection and rebellion among her colored\r\n        population, the authorities of this State, and city in\r\n        particular, be requested to lay hold of, and put in\r\n        prison, immediately, any and all fugitive slave-hunters\r\n        who may be found among us, upon the same ground, and for\r\n        similar reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Spirited addresses, of a most emphatic type, were made by\r\n    Messrs. Remond, of Salem, Roberts, Nell, and Allen, of Boston,\r\n    and Davis, of Plymouth. Individuals and highly respectable\r\n    committees of gentlemen have repeatedly waited upon these\r\n    Georgia miscreants, to persuade them to make a speedy departure\r\n    from the city. After promising to do so, and repeatedly\r\n    falsifying their word, it is said that they left on Wednesday\r\n    afternoon, in the express train for New York, and thus (says the\r\n    Chronotype), they have \"gone off with their ears full of fleas,\r\n    to fire the solemn word for the dissolution of the Union!\"\r\n\r\n    Telegraphic intelligence is received, that President Fillmore\r\n    has announced his determination to sustain the Fugitive Slave\r\n    Bill, at all hazards. Let him try! The fugitives, as well as the\r\n    colored people generally, seem determined to carry out the\r\n    spirit of the resolutions to their fullest extent.\r\n\r\n\r\nEllen first received information that the slave-hunters from Georgia\r\nwere after her through Mrs. Geo. S. Hilliard, of Boston, who had been a\r\ngood friend to her from the day of her arrival from slavery. How Mrs.\r\nHilliard obtained the information, the impression it made on Ellen, and\r\nwhere she was secreted, the following extract of a letter written by\r\nMrs. Hilliard, touching the memorable event, will be found deeply\r\ninteresting:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"In regard to William and Ellen Craft, it is true that we\r\n    received her at our house when the first warrant under the act\r\n    of eighteen hundred and fifty was issued.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Bowditch called upon us to say, that the warrant must be for\r\n    William and Ellen, as they were the only fugitives here known to\r\n    have come from Georgia, and the Dr. asked what we could do. I\r\n    went to the house of the Rev. F.T. Gray, on Mt. Vernon street,\r\n    where Ellen was working with Miss Dean, an upholsteress, a\r\n    friend of ours, who had told us she would teach Ellen her trade.\r\n    I proposed to Ellen to come and do some work for me, intending\r\n    not to alarm her. My manner, which I supposed to be indifferent\r\n    and calm, _betrayed_ me, and she threw herself into my arms,\r\n    sobbing and weeping. She, however, recovered her composure as\r\n    soon as we reached the street, and was _very firm_ ever after.\r\n\r\n    My husband wished her, by all means, to be brought to our house,\r\n    and to remain under his protection, saying 'I am perfectly\r\n    willing to meet the penalty, should she be found here, but will\r\n    never give her up.' The penalty, you remember, was six months'\r\n    imprisonment and a thousand dollars fine. William Craft went,\r\n    after a time, to Lewis Hayden. He was at first, as Dr. Bowditch\r\n    told us, 'barricaded in his shop on Cambridge street.' I saw him\r\n    there, and he said, 'Ellen must not be left at your house.'\r\n    'Why? William,' said I, 'do you think we would give her up?'\r\n    'Never,' said he, 'but Mr. Hilliard is not only our friend, but\r\n    he is a U.S. Commissioner, and should Ellen be found in his\r\n    house, he must resign his office, as well as incur the penalty\r\n    of the law, and I will not subject a friend to such a punishment\r\n    for the sake of our safety.' Was not this noble, when you think\r\n    how small was the penalty that any one could receive for aiding\r\n    slaves to escape, compared to the fate which threatened them in\r\n    case they were captured? William C. made the same objection to\r\n    having his wife taken to Mr. Ellis Gray Loring's, he also being\r\n    a friend and a Commissioner.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis deed of humanity and Christian charity is worthy to be commemorated\r\nand classed with the act of the good Samaritan, as the same spirit is\r\nshown in both cases. Often was Mrs. Hilliard's house an asylum for\r\nfugitive slaves.\r\n\r\nAfter the hunters had left the city in dismay, and the storm of\r\nexcitement had partially subsided, the friends of William and Ellen\r\nconcluded that they had better seek a country where they would not be in\r\ndaily fear of slave-catchers, backed by the Government of the United\r\nStates. They were, therefore, advised to go to Great Britain. Outfits\r\nwere liberally provided for them, passages procured, and they took their\r\ndeparture for a habitation in a foreign land.\r\n\r\nMuch might be told concerning the warm reception they met with from the\r\nfriends of humanity on every hand, during a stay in England of nearly a\r\nscore of years, but we feel obliged to make the following extract\r\nsuffice:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM WM. FARMER, ESQ., OF LONDON, TO WM. LLOYD\r\nGARRISON, JUNE 26, 1851--\"FUGITIVE SLAVES AT THE GREAT EXHIBITION.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Fortunately, we have, at the present moment, in the British\r\n    Metropolis, some specimens of what were once American \"chattels\r\n    personal,\" in the persons of William and Ellen Craft, and\r\n    William W. Brown, and their friends resolved that they should be\r\n    exhibited under the world's huge glass case, in order that the\r\n    world might form its opinion of the alleged mental inferiority\r\n    of the African race, and their fitness or unfitness for freedom.\r\n    A small party of anti-slavery friends was accordingly formed to\r\n    accompany the fugitives through the Exhibition. Mr. and Mrs.\r\n    Estlin, of Bristol, and a lady friend, Mr. and Mrs. Richard\r\n    Webb, of Dublin, and a son and daughter, Mr. McDonnell, (a most\r\n    influential member of the Executive Committee of the National\r\n    Reform Association--one of our unostentatious, but highly\r\n    efficient workers for reform in this country, and whose public\r\n    and private acts, if you were acquainted with, you would feel\r\n    the same esteem and affection for him as is felt towards him by\r\n    Mr. Thompson, myself and many others)--these ladies and\r\n    gentlemen, together with myself, met at Mr. Thompson's house,\r\n    and, in company with Mrs. Thompson, and Miss Amelia Thompson,\r\n    the Crafts and Brown, proceeded from thence to the Exhibition.\r\n    Saturday was selected, as a day upon which the largest number of\r\n    the aristocracy and wealthy classes attend the Crystal Palace,\r\n    and the company was, on this occasion, the most distinguished\r\n    that had been gathered together within its walls since its\r\n    opening day. Some fifteen thousand, mostly of the upper classes,\r\n    were there congregated, including the Queen, Prince Albert, and\r\n    the royal children, the anti-slavery Duchess of Sutherland, (by\r\n    whom the fugitives were evidently favorably regarded), the Duke\r\n    of Wellington, the Bishops of Winchester and St. Asaph, a large\r\n    number of peers, peeresses, members of Parliament, merchants and\r\n    bankers, and distinguished men from almost all parts of the\r\n    world, surpassing, in variety of tongue, character and costume,\r\n    the description of the population of Jerusalem on the day of\r\n    Pentecost--a season of which it is hoped the Great Exhibition\r\n    will prove a type, in the copious outpouring of the holy spirit\r\n    of brotherly union, and the consequent diffusion, throughout the\r\n    world, of the anti-slavery gospel of good will to all men.\r\n\r\n    In addition to the American exhibitors, it so happened that the\r\n    American visitors were particularly numerous, among whom the\r\n    experienced eyes of Brown and the Crafts enabled them to detect\r\n    slave-holders by dozens. Mr. McDonnell escorted Mrs. Craft, and\r\n    Mrs. Thompson; Miss Thompson, at her own request, took the arm\r\n    of Wm. Wells Brown, whose companion she elected to be for the\r\n    day; Wm. Craft walked with Miss Amelia Thompson and myself. This\r\n    arrangement was purposely made in order that there might be no\r\n    appearance of patronizing the fugitives, but that it might be\r\n    shown that we regarded them as our equals, and honored them for\r\n    their heroic escape from Slavery. Quite contrary to the feeling\r\n    of ordinary visitors, the American department was our chief\r\n    attraction. Upon arriving at Powers' Greek Slave, our glorious\r\n    anti-slavery friend, Punch's 'Virginia Slave' was produced. I\r\n    hope you have seen this production of our great humorous\r\n    moralist. It is an admirably-drawn figure of a female slave in\r\n    chains, with the inscription beneath, 'The Virginia Slave, a\r\n    companion for Powers' Greek Slave.' The comparison of the two\r\n    soon drew a small crowd, including several Americans, around and\r\n    near us. Although they refrained from any audible expression of\r\n    feeling, the object of the comparison was evidently understood\r\n    and keenly felt. It would not have been prudent in us to have\r\n    challenged, in words, an anti-slavery discussion in the World's\r\n    Convention; but everything that we could with propriety do was\r\n    done to induce them to break silence upon the subject. We had no\r\n    intention, verbally, of taking the initiative in such a\r\n    discussion; we confined ourselves to speaking at them, in order\r\n    that they might be led to speak to us; but our efforts were of\r\n    no avail. The gauntlet, which was unmistakably thrown down by\r\n    our party, the Americans were too wary to take up. We spoke\r\n    among each other of the wrongs of Slavery; it was in vain. We\r\n    discoursed freely upon the iniquity of a professedly Christian\r\n    Republic holding three millions of its population in cruel and\r\n    degrading bondage; you might as well have preached to the winds.\r\n    Wm. Wells Brown took 'Punch's Virginia Slave' and deposited it\r\n    within the enclosure by the 'Greek Slave,' saying audibly, 'As\r\n    an American fugitive slave, I place this 'Virginia Slave' by the\r\n    side of the 'Greek Slave,' as its most fitting companion.' Not a\r\n    word, or reply, or remonstrance from Yankee or Southerner. We\r\n    had not, however, proceeded many steps from the place before the\r\n    'Virginia Slave' was removed. We returned to the statue, and\r\n    stood near the American by whom it had been taken up, to give\r\n    him an opportunity of making any remarks he chose upon the\r\n    matter. Whatever were his feelings, his policy was to keep his\r\n    lips closed. If he had felt that the act was wrongful, would he\r\n    not have appealed to the sense of justice of the British\r\n    bystanders, who are always ready to resist an insult offered to\r\n    a foreigner in this country? If it was an insult, why not resent\r\n    it, as became high-spirited Americans? But no; the chivalry of\r\n    the South tamely allowed itself to be plucked by the beard; the\r\n    garrulity of the North permitted itself to be silenced by three\r\n    fugitive slaves.... We promenaded the Exhibition between six and\r\n    seven hours, and visited nearly every portion of the vast\r\n    edifice. Among the thousands whom we met in our perambulations,\r\n    who dreamed of any impropriety in a gentleman of character and\r\n    standing, like Mr. McDonnell, walking arm-in-arm with a colored\r\n    woman; or an elegant and accomplished young lady, like Miss\r\n    Thompson, (daughter of the Hon. George Thompson, M.C.), becoming\r\n    the promenading companion of a colored man? Did the English\r\n    peers or peeresses? Not the most aristocratic among them. Did\r\n    the representatives of any other country have their notions of\r\n    propriety shocked by the matter? None but Americans. To see the\r\n    arm of a beautiful English young lady passed through that of 'a\r\n    nigger,' taking ices and other refreshments with him, upon terms\r\n    of the most perfect equality, certainly was enough to 'rile,'\r\n    and evidently did 'rile' the slave-holders who beheld it; but\r\n    there was no help for it. Even the New York Broadway bullies\r\n    would not have dared to utter a word of insult, much less lift a\r\n    finger against Wm. Wells Brown, when walking with his fair\r\n    companion in the World's Exhibition. It was a circumstance not\r\n    to be forgotten by these Southern Bloodhounds. Probably, for the\r\n    first time in their lives, they felt themselves thoroughly\r\n    muzzled; they dared not even to bark, much less bite. Like the\r\n    meanest curs, they had to sneak through the Crystal Palace,\r\n    unnoticed and uncared for; while the victims who had been\r\n    rescued from their jaws, were warmly greeted by visitors from\r\n    all parts of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nBrown and the Crafts have paid several other visits to the Great\r\nExhibition, in one of which, Wm. Craft succeeded in getting some\r\nSoutherners \"out\" upon the Fugitive Slave Bill, respecting which a\r\ndiscussion was held between them in the American department. Finding\r\nthemselves worsted at every point, they were compelled to have recourse\r\nto lying, and unblushingly denied that the bill contained the provisions\r\nwhich Craft alleged it did. Craft took care to inform them who and what\r\nhe was. He told them that there had been too much information upon that\r\nmeasure diffused in England for lying to conceal them. He has\r\nsubsequently met the same parties, who, with contemptible hypocrisy,\r\ntreated \"the nigger\" with great respect.\r\n\r\nIn England the Crafts were highly respected. While under her British\r\nMajesty's protection, Ellen became the mother of several children,\r\n(having had none under the stars and stripes). These they spared no\r\npains in educating for usefulness in the world. Some two years since\r\nWilliam and Ellen returned with two of their children to the United\r\nStates, and after visiting Boston and other places, William concluded to\r\nvisit Georgia, his old home, with a view of seeing what inducement war\r\nhad opened up to enterprise, as he had felt a desire to remove his\r\nfamily thither, if encouraged. Indeed he was prepared to purchase a\r\nplantation, if he found matters satisfactory. This visit evidently\r\nfurnished the needed encouragement, judging from the fact that he did\r\npurchase a plantation somewhere in the neighborhood of Savannah, and is\r\nat present living there with his family.\r\n\r\nThe portraits of William and Ellen represent them at the present stage\r\nof life, (as citizens of the U.S.)--of course they have greatly changed\r\nin appearance from what they were when they first fled from Georgia.\r\nObviously the Fugitive Slave Law in its crusade against William and\r\nEllen Craft, reaped no advantages, but on the contrary, liberty was\r\ngreatly the gainer.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVALS FROM RICHMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEWIS COBB AND NANCY BRISTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one Southern city furnished a larger number of brave, wide-awake and\r\nlikely-looking Underground Rail Road passengers than the city of\r\nRichmond. Lewis and Nancy were fair specimens of the class of travelers\r\ncoming from that city. Lewis was described as a light yellow man, medium\r\nsize, good-looking, and intelligent. In referring to bondage, he spoke\r\nwith great earnestness, and in language very easily understood;\r\nespecially when speaking of Samuel Myers, from whom he escaped, he did\r\nnot hesitate to give him the character of being a very hard man, who was\r\nnever satisfied, no matter how hard the slaves might try to please him.\r\n\r\nMyers was engaged in the commission and forwarding business, and was a\r\nman of some standing in Richmond. From him Lewis had received very\r\nsevere floggings, the remembrance of which he would not only carry with\r\nhim to Canada, but to the grave. It was owing to abuse of this kind that\r\nhe was awakened to look for a residence under the protection of the\r\nBritish Lion. For eight months he longed to get away, and had no rest\r\nuntil he found himself on the Underground Rail Road.\r\n\r\nHis master was a member of the Century Methodist Church, as was also his\r\nwife and family; but Lewis thought that they were strangers to practical\r\nChristianity, judging from the manner that the slaves were treated by\r\nboth master and mistress. Lewis was a Baptist, and belonged to the\r\nsecond church. Twelve hundred dollars had been offered for him. He left\r\nhis father (Judville), and his brother, John Harris, both slaves. In\r\nview of his prospects in Canada, Lewis' soul overflowed with pleasing\r\nanticipations of freedom, and the Committee felt great satisfaction in\r\nassisting him.\r\n\r\nNancy was also from Richmond, and came in the same boat with Lewis. She\r\nrepresented the most \"likely-looking female bond servants.\" Indeed her\r\nappearance recommended her at once. She was neat, modest, and\r\nwell-behaved--with a good figure and the picture of health, with a\r\ncountenance beaming with joy and gladness, notwithstanding the late\r\nstruggles and sufferings through which she had passed. Young as she was,\r\nshe had seen much of slavery, and had, doubtless, profited by the\r\nlessons thereof. At all events, it was through cruel treatment, having\r\nbeen frequently beaten after she had passed her eighteenth year, that\r\nshe was prompted to seek freedom. It was so common for her mistress to\r\ngive way to unbridled passions that Nancy never felt safe. Under the\r\nseverest infliction of punishment she was not allowed to complain.\r\nNeither from mistress nor master had she any reason to expect mercy or\r\nleniency--indeed she saw no way of escape but by the Underground Rail\r\nRoad.\r\n\r\nIt was true that the master, Mr. William Bears, was a Yankee from\r\nConnecticut, and his wife a member of the Episcopal Church, but Nancy's\r\nyoke seemed none the lighter for all that. Fully persuaded that she\r\nwould never find her lot any better while remaining in their hands, she\r\naccepted the advice and aid of a young man to whom she was engaged; he\r\nwas shrewd enough to find an agent in Richmond, with whom he entered\r\ninto a covenant to have Nancy brought away. With a cheerful heart the\r\njourney was undertaken in the manner aforesaid, and she safely reached\r\nthe Committee. Her mother, one brother and a sister she had to leave in\r\nRichmond. One thousand dollars were lost in the departure of Nancy.\r\n\r\nHaving been accommodated and aided by the Committee, they were forwarded\r\nto Canada. Lewis wrote back repeatedly and expressed himself very\r\ngratefully for favors received, as will be seen by the appended letters\r\nfrom him:\r\n\r\n\r\n    TORONTO, April 25, 1857.\r\n\r\n    To MR. WM. STILL--Dear Sir:--I take this opportunity of\r\n    addressing these few lines to inform you that I am well and hope\r\n    that they may find you and your family enjoying the same good\r\n    health. Please to give my love to you and your family. I had a\r\n    very pleasant trip from your house that morning. Dear sir, you\r\n    would oblige me much, if you have not sent that box to Mr.\r\n    Robinson, to open it and take out the little yellow box that I\r\n    tied up in the large one and send it on by express to me in\r\n    Toronto. Lift up a few of the things and you will find it near\r\n    the top. All the clothes that I have are in that box and I stand\r\n    in need of them. You would oblige me much by so doing. I stopped\r\n    at Mr. Jones' in Elmira, and was very well treated by him while\r\n    there. I am now in Toronto and doing very well at present. I am\r\n    very thankful to you and your family for the attention you paid\r\n    to me while at your house. I wish you would see Mr. Ormsted and\r\n    ask him if he has not some things for Mr. Anthony Loney, and if\r\n    he has, please send them on with my things, as we are both\r\n    living together at this time. Give my love to Mr. Anthony, also\r\n    to Mr. Ormsted and family. Dear sir, we both would be very glad\r\n    for you to attend to this, as we both do stand very much in need\r\n    of them at this time. Dear sir, you will oblige me by giving my\r\n    love to Miss Frances Watkins, and as she said she hoped to be\r\n    out in the summer, I should like to see her. I have met with a\r\n    gentleman here by the name of Mr. Truehart, and he sends his\r\n    best love to you and your family. Mr. Truehart desires to know\r\n    whether you received the letter he sent to you, and if so,\r\n    answer it as soon as possible. Please answer this letter as soon\r\n    as possible. I must now come to a close by saying that I remain\r\n    your beloved friend,\r\n\r\n    LEWIS COBB.\r\n\r\n    The young man who was there that morning, Mr. Robinson, got\r\n    married to that young lady.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    TORONTO, June 2d, 1857.\r\n\r\n    To MR. WM. STILL--Dear Sir:--I received yours dated May 6th, and\r\n    was extremely happy to hear from you. You may be surprised that\r\n    I have not answered you before this, but it was on account of\r\n    not knowing anything concerning the letter being in the\r\n    post-office until I was told so by a friend. The box, of which I\r\n    had been inquiring, I have received, and am infinitely obliged\r\n    to you for sending it. Mr. and Mrs. Renson are living in\r\n    Hamilton, C.W. They send their best love to you and your family.\r\n    I am at present residing in Toronto, C.W. Mr. Anthony Loney has\r\n    gone on to Boston, and is desirous of my coming on to him; and\r\n    as I have many acquaintances there, I should like to know from\r\n    you whether it would be advisable or not. Give, if you please,\r\n    my best love to your family and accept the same for yourself,\r\n    and also to Mr. James Ormsted and family. Tell James Ormsted I\r\n    would be glad if he would send me a pair of thick, heavy boots,\r\n    for it rains and hails as often out here in the summer, as it\r\n    does there in the winter. Tell him to send No. 9, and anything\r\n    he thinks will do me good in this cold country. Please to give\r\n    to Mr. James Ormsted to give to Mr. Robert Seldon, and tell him\r\n    to give it to my father. Mr. and Mrs. Truehart send their love\r\n    to you and your family. If the gentleman, Mr. R.S., is not\r\n    running on the boat now, you can give directions to Ludwill\r\n    Cobb, in care of Mr. R. Seldon, Richmond, Va. Tell Mr. Ormsted\r\n    not to forget my boots and send them by express. No more at\r\n    present, but remain yours very truly,\r\n\r\n    Please write soon.\r\n\r\n    LEWIS COBB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPASSENGERS FROM NORTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\n\r\n[BY SCHOONER.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMAJOR LATHAM, WILLIAM WILSON, HENRY GORHAM, WILEY MADDISON, AND ANDREW\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\n\r\nThe above named passengers were delivered into the hands of Thomas\r\nGarrett by the Captain who brought them, and were aided and forwarded to\r\nthe Committee in Philadelphia, as indicated by the subjoined letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILMINGTON, 11th mo., 6th, 1856.\r\n\r\n    RESPECTED FRIEND:--WILLIAM STILL:--Thine of yesterday, came to\r\n    hand this morning, advising me to forward those four men to\r\n    thee, which I propose to send from here in the steam boat, at\r\n    two o'clock, P.M. to day to thy care; one of them thinks he has\r\n    a brother and cousin in New Bedford, and is anxious to get to\r\n    them, the others thee can do what thee thinks best with, after\r\n    consulting with them, we have rigged them up pretty comfortably\r\n    with clothes, and I have paid for their passage to Philadelphia,\r\n    and also for the passage of their pilot there and back; he\r\n    proposed to ask thee for three dollars, for the three days time\r\n    he lost with them, but that we will raise here for him, as one\r\n    of them expects to have some money brought from Carolina soon,\r\n    that belongs to him, and wants thee when they are fixed, to let\r\n    me know so that I may forward it to them. I will give each of\r\n    them a card of our firm. Hoping they may get along safe, I\r\n    remain as ever, thy sincere friend,\r\n\r\n    THOS. GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe passengers by this arrival were above the ordinary plantation or\r\nfarm hand slave, as will appear from a glance at their condition under\r\nthe yoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor Latham was forty-four years of age, mulatto, very resolute, with\r\ngood natural abilities, and a decided hater of slavery. John Latham was\r\nthe man whom he addressed as \"master,\" which was a very bitter pill for\r\nhim to swallow. He had been married twice, and at the time of his escape\r\nhe was the husband of two wives. The first one, with their three\r\nchildren, in consequence of changes incident to slave life, was sold a\r\nlong distance from her old home and husband, thereby ending the\r\nprivilege of living together; he could think of them, but that was all;\r\nhe was compelled to give them up altogether. After a time he took to\r\nhimself another wife, with whom he lived several years. Three more\r\nchildren owned him as father--the result of this marriage. During his\r\nentire manhood Major had been brutally treated by his master, which\r\ncaused him a great deal of anguish and trouble of mind.\r\n\r\nOnly a few weeks before he escaped, his master, in one of his fits of\r\npassion, flogged him most cruelly. From that time the resolution was\r\npermanently grounded in his mind to find the way to freedom, if\r\npossible, before many more weeks had passed. Day and night he studied,\r\nworked and planned, with freedom uppermost in his mind. The hour of hope\r\narrived and with it Captain F.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam, a fellow-passenger with Major, was forty-two years of age, just\r\nin the prime of life, and represented the mechanics in chains, being a\r\nblacksmith by trade. Dr. Thomas Warren, who followed farming in the\r\nneighborhood of Eatontown, was the owner of William. In speaking of his\r\nslave life William said: \"I was sold four times; twice I was separated\r\nfrom my wives. I was separated from one of my wives when living in\r\nPortsmouth, Virginia,\" etc.\r\n\r\nIn his simple manner of describing the trials he had been called upon to\r\nendure, it was not to be wondered at that he was willing to forsake all\r\nand run fearful risks in order to rid himself not only of the \"load on\r\nhis back,\" but the load on his heart. By the very positive character of\r\nWilliam's testimony against slavery, the Committee felt more than ever\r\njustified in encouraging the Underground Rail Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Gorham was thirty-four years of age, a \"prime,\" heavy, dark,\r\nsmart, \"article,\" and a good carpenter. He admitted that he had never\r\nfelt the lash on his back, but, nevertheless, he had felt deeply on the\r\nsubject of slavery. For years the chief concern with him was as to how\r\nhe could safely reach a free State. Slavery he hated with a perfect\r\nhatred. To die in the woods, live in a cave, or sacrifice himself in\r\nsome way, he was bound to do, rather than remain a slave. The more he\r\nreflected over his condition the more determined he grew to seek his\r\nfreedom. Accordingly he left and went to the woods; there he prepared\r\nhimself a cave and resolved to live and die in it rather than return to\r\nbondage. Before he found his way out of the prison-house eleven months\r\nelapsed. His strong impulse for freedom, and intense aversion to\r\nslavery, sustained him until he found an opportunity to escape by the\r\nUnderground Rail Road.\r\n\r\nOne of the tried Agents of the Underground Rail Road was alone cognizant\r\nof his dwelling in the cave, and regarding him as a tolerably safe\r\npassenger (having been so long secreted), secured him a passage on the\r\nschooner, and thus he was fortunately relieved from his eleven months'\r\nresidence in his den. No rhetoric or fine scholarship was needed in his\r\ncase to make his story interesting. None but hearts of stone could have\r\nlistened without emotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew, another fellow-passenger, was twenty-six years of age, and a\r\ndecidedly inviting-looking specimen of the peculiar institution. He\r\nfilled the situation of an engineer. He, with his wife and one child,\r\nbelonged to a small orphan girl, who lived at South End, Camden county,\r\nN.C. His wife and child had to be left behind. While it seemed very hard\r\nfor a husband thus to leave his wife, every one that did so weakened\r\nslavery and encouraged and strengthened anti-slavery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNumbered with these four North Carolina passengers is found the name of\r\nWiley Maddison, a young man nineteen years of age, who escaped from\r\nPetersburg on the cars as a white man. He was of promising appearance,\r\nand found no difficulty whatever on the road. With the rest, however, he\r\nconcluded himself hardly safe this side of Canada, and it afforded the\r\nCommittee special pleasure to help them all.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS CLINTON, SAUNEY PRY AND BENJAMIN DUCKET.\r\n\r\n\r\nPASSED OVER THE U.G.R.R., IN THE FALL OF 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas escaped from Baltimore. He described the man from whom he fled as\r\na \"rum drinker\" of some note, by the name of Benjamin Walmsly, and he\r\ntestified that under him he was neither \"half fed nor clothed,\" in\r\nconsequence of which he was dissatisfied, and fled to better his\r\ncondition. Luckily Thomas succeeded in making his escape when about\r\ntwenty-one years of age. His appearance and smartness indicated\r\nresolution and gave promise of future success. He was well made and of a\r\nchestnut color.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSauney Pry came from Loudon Co., Va. He had been one of the \"well-cared\r\nfor,\" on the farm of Nathan Clapton, who owned some sixty or seventy\r\nslaves. Upon inquiry as to the treatment and character of his master,\r\nSauney unhesitatingly described him as a \"very mean, swearing,\r\nblustering man, as hard as any that could be started.\" It was on this\r\naccount that he was prompted to turn his face against Virginia and to\r\nventure on the Underground Rail Road. Sauney was twenty-seven years of\r\nage, chestnut color, medium size, and in intellect was at least up to\r\nthe average.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBenjamin Ducket came from Bell Mountain, Prince George's Co., Maryland.\r\nHe stated to the Committee that he escaped from one Sicke Perry, a\r\nfarmer. Of his particular master he spoke thus: \"He was one of the\r\nbaddest men about Prince George; he would both fight and kill up.\"\r\n\r\nThese characteristics of the master developed in Ben very strong desires\r\nto get beyond his reach. In fact, his master's conduct was the sole\r\ncause of his seeking the Underground Rail Road. At the time that he came\r\nto Philadelphia, he was recorded as twenty-three years of age, chestnut\r\ncolor, medium size, and wide awake. He left his father, mother, two\r\nbrothers, and three sisters, owned by Marcus Devoe.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time that the passengers just described received succor,\r\nElizabeth Lambert, with three children, reached the Committee. The names\r\nof the children were, Mary, Horace, and William Henry, quite\r\nmarketable-looking articles.\r\n\r\nThey fled from Middletown, Delaware, where they had been owned by Andrew\r\nPeterson. The poor mother's excuse for leaving her \"comfortable home,\r\nfree board, and kind-hearted master and mistress,\" was simply because\r\nshe was tired of such \"kindness,\" and was, therefore, willing to suffer\r\nin order to get away from it.\r\n\r\nHill Jones, a lad of eighteen, accompanied Elizabeth with her children\r\nfrom Middletown. He had seen enough of Slavery to satisfy him that he\r\ncould never relish it. His owner was known by the name of John Cochran,\r\nand followed farming. He was of a chestnut color, and well-grown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVALS IN APRIL, 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES HALL, JAMES JOHNSON, CHARLES CARTER,  GEORGE, AND JOHN LOGAN,\r\nJAMES HENRY WATSON,  ZEBULON GREEN, LEWIS, AND PETER BURRELL,  WILLIAM\r\nWILLIAMS, AND HIS WIFE--HARRIET TUBMAN, WITH FOUR PASSENGERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Hall. This individual was from Maryland, Baltimore Co., where\r\n\"black men had no rights which white men were bound to respect,\"\r\naccording to the decision of the late Chief Justice Taney of the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States.\r\n\r\nCharles was owned by Atwood A. Blunt, a farmer, much of whose time was\r\ndevoted to card playing, rum-drinking and fox-hunting, so Charles\r\nstated. Charles gave him the credit of being as mild a specimen of a\r\nslaveholder as that region of country could claim when in a sober mood,\r\nbut when drunk every thing went wrong with him, nothing could satisfy\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nCharles testified, however, that the despotism of his mistress was much\r\nworse than that of his master, for she was all the time hard on the\r\nslaves. Latterly he had heard much talk about selling, and, believing\r\nthat matters would soon have to come to that, he concluded to seek a\r\nplace where colored men had rights, in Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Johnson. James fled from Deer Creek, Harford Co., Md., where he\r\nwas owned by William Rautty. \"Jim's\" hour had come. Within one day of\r\nthe time fixed for his sale, he was handcuffed, and it was evidently\r\nsupposed that he was secure. Trembling at his impending doom he resolved\r\nto escape if possible. He could not rid himself of the handcuffs. Could\r\nhe have done so, he was persuaded that he might manage to make his way\r\nalong safely. He resolved to make an effort with the handcuffs on.\r\n\r\nWith resolution his freedom was secured. What Master Rautty said when he\r\nfound his property gone with the handcuffs, we know not.\r\n\r\nThe next day after Jim arrived, Charles Carter, George and John Logan\r\ncame to hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles had been under the yoke in the city of Richmond, held to service\r\nby Daniel Delaplain, a flour inspector. Charles was hired out by the\r\nflour inspector for as much as he could command for him, for being a\r\ndevoted lover of money, ordinary wages hardly ever satisfied him. In\r\nother respects Charles spoke of his master rather favorably in\r\ncomparison with slaveholders generally.\r\n\r\nA thirty years' apprenticeship as a slave had not, however, won him over\r\nto the love of the system; he had long since been convinced that it was\r\nnonsense to suppose that such a thing as happiness could be found even\r\nunder the best of masters. He claimed to have a wife and four little\r\nchildren living in Alexandria Va.; the name of the wife was Lucinda. In\r\nthe estimation of slave-holders, the fact of Charles having a family\r\nmight have offered no cause for unhappiness, but Charles felt\r\ndifferently in relation to the matter. Again, for reasons best known to\r\nthe owner, he talked of selling Charles. On this point Charles also felt\r\nquite nervous, so he began to think that he had better make an attempt\r\nto get beyond the reach of buyers and sellers. He knew that many others\r\nsimilarly situated had got out of bondage simply by hard struggling, and\r\nhe felt that he could do likewise. When he had thus determined the\r\nobject was half accomplished. True, every step that he should take was\r\nliable to bring trouble upon himself, yet with the hope of freedom\r\nbuoying him up he resolved to run the risk. Charles was about thirty\r\nyears of age, likely-looking, well made, intelligent, and a mulatto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge was twenty-three years of age, quite dark, medium size, and bore\r\nthe marks of a man of considerable pluck. He was the slave of Mrs. Jane\r\nCoultson. No special complaint of her is recorded on the book. She might\r\nhave been a very good mistress, but George was not a very happy and\r\ncontented piece of property, as was proved by his course in escaping.\r\nThe cold North had many more charms for him than the sunny South.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn has been already described in the person of his brother George. He\r\nwas not, however, the property of Mrs. Coultson, but was owned by Miss\r\nCox, near Little Georgetown, Berkeley Co., Va. These three individuals\r\nwere held as slaves by that class of slave-holders, known in the South\r\nas the most kind-hearted and indulgent, yet they seemed just as much\r\ndelighted with the prospects of freedom as any other passengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day following the arrival of the party just noticed James Henry\r\nWatson reached the Committee. He was in good condition, the spring\r\nweather having been favorable, and the journey made without any serious\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nHe was from Snowhill, Worcester county, Md., and had escaped from James\r\nPurnell, a farmer of whom he did not speak very favorably. Yet James\r\nadmitted that his master was not as hard on his slaves as some others.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of James' kinsfolk, who may still perchance be making\r\nsearches for him, not having yet learned whither he went or what became\r\nof him, we copy the following paragraph as entered on our book April\r\n11th, 1856:\r\n\r\nJames Henry is twenty years of age, dark, well-made, modest, and seems\r\nfearful of apprehension; was moved to escape in order to obtain his\r\nfreedom. He had heard of others who had run away and thus secured their\r\nfreedom; he thought he could do the same. He left his father, mother,\r\nthree brothers and five sisters owned by Purnell. His father's name was\r\nEphraim, his mother's name Mahala. The names of his sisters and brothers\r\nwere as follows: Hetty, Betsy, Dinah, Catharine and Harriet; Homer,\r\nWilliam and James.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZebulon Green was the next traveler. He arrived from Duck Creek, Md.\r\nJohn Appleton, a farmer, was chargeable with having deprived Zeb of his\r\nrights. But, as Zeb was only about eighteen years of age when he made\r\nhis exit, Mr. Appleton did not get much the start of him. In answer to\r\nthe question as to the cause of his escape, he replied \"bad usage.\" He\r\nwas smart, and quite dark. In traveling, he changed his name to Samuel\r\nHill. The Committee endeavored to impress him thoroughly, with the idea\r\nthat he could do much good in the world for himself and fellow-men, by\r\nusing his best endeavors to acquire education, etc., and forwarded him\r\non to Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLewis Burrell and his brother Peter arrived safely from Alexandria,\r\nVirginia, April 21, 1856. Lewis had been owned by Edward M. Clark, Peter\r\nby Benjamin Johnson Hall. These passengers seemed to be well posted in\r\nregard to Slavery, and understood full well their responsibilities in\r\nfleeing from \"kind-hearted\" masters. All they feared was that they might\r\nnot reach Canada safely, although they were pretty hopeful and quite\r\nresolute. Lewis left a wife, Winna Ann, and two children, Joseph and\r\nMary, who were owned by Pembroke Thomas, at Culpepper, Va., nearly a\r\nhundred miles distant from him. Once or twice in the year, was the\r\nprivilege allowed him to visit his wife and little ones at this long\r\ndistance. This separation constituted his daily grief and was the cause\r\nof his escape. Lewis and Peter left their father and mother in bondage,\r\nalso one brother (Reuben), and three sisters, two of whom had been sold\r\nfar South.\r\n\r\nAfter a sojourn in freedom of nearly three years, Lewis wrote on behalf\r\nof his wife as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    TORONTO, C.W., Feb. 2, 1859.\r\n\r\n    MR. WM. STILL:\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:--It have bin two years since I war at your house, at\r\n    that time I war on my way to cannadia, and I tould you that I\r\n    had a wife and had to leave her behind, and you promiest me that\r\n    you would healp me to gait hir if I ever heaird from hir, and I\r\n    think my dear frend, that the time is come for me to strick the\r\n    blow, will you healp me, according to your promis. I recived a\r\n    letter from a frend in Washington last night and he says that my\r\n    wife is in the city of Baltimore, and she will come away if she\r\n    can find a frend to healp hir, so I thought I would writ to you\r\n    as you are acquanted with foulks theare to howm you can trust\r\n    with such matthas. I could write to Mr Noah davis in Baltimore,\r\n    who is well acquanted with my wife, but I do not think that he\r\n    is a trew frend, and I could writ to Mr Samual Maden in the same\r\n    city, but I am afread that a letter coming from cannada might be\r\n    dedteced, but if you will writ to soume one that you know, and\r\n    gait them to see Mr Samual Maden he will give all the\r\n    information that you want, as he is acquanted with my wife, he\r\n    is a preacher and belongs to the Baptis church. My wifes name is\r\n    Winne Ann Berrell, and she is oned by one Dr. Tarns who is on a\r\n    viset to Baltimore, now Mr Still will you attend to this thing\r\n    for me, fourthwith, if you will I will pay you four your truble,\r\n    if we can dow any thing it must be don now, as she will leave\r\n    theare in the spring, and if you will take the matter in hand,\r\n    you mous writ me on to reseption of this letter, whether you\r\n    will or not.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n\r\n    LEWIS BURRELL.\r\n\r\n    No. 49 Victoria St., Toronto, C.W.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs in the case of many others, the way was so completely blocked that\r\nnothing could be done for the wife's deliverance. Until the day when the\r\nmillions of fetters were broken, nothing gave so much pain to husbands\r\nand wives as these heart-breaking separations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Williams and his wife were the next who arrived. They came from\r\nHaven Manor, Md. They had been owned by John Peak, by whom, according to\r\ntheir report, they had been badly treated, and the Committee had no\r\nreason to doubt their testimony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next arrival numbered four passengers, and came under the guidance\r\nof \"Moses\" (Harriet Tubman), from Maryland. They were adults, looking as\r\nthough they could take care of themselves very easily, although they had\r\nthe marks of Slavery on them. It was no easy matter for men and women\r\nwho had been ground down all their lives, to appear as though they had\r\nbeen enjoying freedom. Indeed, the only wonder was that so many appeared\r\nto as good advantage as they did, after having been crushed down so\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nThe paucity of the narratives in the month of April, is quite\r\nnoticeable. Why fuller reports were not written out, cannot now be\r\naccounted for; probably the feeling existed that it was useless to write\r\nout narratives, except in cases of very special interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE FROM GEORGETOWN CROSS ROADS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTHER AND CHILD FROM NORFOLK, VA., ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABE FINEER, SAM DAVIS, HENRY SAUNDERS, WM. HENRY THOMPSON and THOMAS\r\nPARKER arrived safely from the above named place. Upon inquiry, the\r\nfollowing information was gleaned from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbe spoke with feelings of some bitterness of a farmer known by the name\r\nof George Spencer, who had deprived him of the hard earnings of his\r\nhands. Furthermore, he had worked him hard, stinted him for food and\r\nclothing and had been in the habit of flogging him whenever he felt like\r\nit. In addition to the above charges, Abe did not hesitate to say that\r\nhis master meddled too much with the bottle, in consequence of which, he\r\nwas often in a \"top-heavy\" state. Abe said, however, that he was rich\r\nand stood pretty high in the neighborhood--stinting, flogging and\r\ndrinking were no great disadvantages to a man in Georgetown, Maryland.\r\n\r\nAbe was twenty-three years of age, pure black, ordinary size, and\r\nspirited, a thorough convert to the doctrine that all men are born free,\r\nand although he had been held in bondage up to the hour of his escape,\r\nhe gave much reason for believing that he would not be an easy subject\r\nto manage under the yoke, if ever captured and carried back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSam was about thirty years of age, genuine black, common size, and a\r\nhater of slavery; he was prepared to show, by the scars he bore about\r\nhis person, why he talked as he did. Forever will he remember James\r\nHurst, his so-called master, who was a very blustering man oft-times,\r\nand in the habit of abusing his slaves. Sam was led to seek the\r\nUnderground Rail Road, in order to get rid of his master and, at the\r\nsame time, to do better for himself than he could possibly do in\r\nSlavery. He had to leave his wife, Phillis, and one child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry was about twenty-four years of age, and of a chestnut\r\ncolor. He too talked of slave-holders, and his master in particular,\r\njust as any man would talk who had been shamefully robbed and wronged\r\nall his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTom, likewise, told the same story, and although they used the\r\ncorn-field vernacular, they were in earnest and possessed an abundance\r\nof mother-wit, so that their testimony was not to be made light of.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from Thomas Garrett speaks for itself:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILMINGTON, 5 mo. 11th, 1856.\r\n\r\n    ESTEEMED FRIENDS--McKim and Still:--I purpose sending to-morrow\r\n    morning by the steamboat a woman and child, whose husband, I\r\n    think, went some nine months previous to New Bedford. She was\r\n    furnished with a free passage by the same line her husband came\r\n    in. She has been away from the person claiming to be her master\r\n    some five months; we, therefore, think there cannot be much risk\r\n    at present. Those four I wrote thee about arrived safe up in the\r\n    neighborhood of Longwood, and Harriet Tubman followed after in\r\n    the stage yesterday. I shall expect five more from the same\r\n    neighborhood next trip. Captain Lambdin is desirous of having\r\n    sent him a book, or books, with the strongest arguments of the\r\n    noted men of the South against the institution of slavery, as he\r\n    wishes to prepare to defend himself, as he has little confidence\r\n    in his attorney. Cannot you send to me something that will be of\r\n    benefit to him, or send it direct to him? Would not W. Goodell's\r\n    book be of use? His friends here think there is no chance for\r\n    him but to go to the penitentiary. They now refuse to let any\r\n    one but his attorney see him.\r\n\r\n    As ever your friend,\r\n\r\n    THOS. GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe woman and child alluded to were received and noted on the record\r\nbook as follows:\r\n\r\nWinnie Patty, and her daughter, Elizabeth, arrived safely from Norfolk,\r\nVa. The mother is about twenty-two years of age, good-looking and of\r\nchestnut color, smart and brave. From the latter part of October, 1855,\r\nto the latter part of March, 1856, this young slave mother, with her\r\nchild, was secreted under the floor of a house. The house was occupied\r\nby a slave family, friends of Winnie. During the cold winter weather she\r\nsuffered severely from wet and cold, getting considerably frosted, but\r\nher faith failed not, even in the hour of greatest extremity. She chose\r\nrather to suffer thus than endure slavery any longer, especially as she\r\nwas aware that the auction-block awaited her. She had already been sold\r\nthree times; she knew therefore what it was to be sold.\r\n\r\nJacob Shuster was the name of the man whom she spoke of as her tormentor\r\nand master, and from whom she fled. He had been engaged in the farming\r\nbusiness, and had owned quite a large number of slaves, but from time to\r\ntime he had been selling off, until he had reduced his stock\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lambdin, spoken of in Thomas Garrett's letter, had, in the\r\nkindness of his heart, brought away in his schooner some Underground\r\nRail Road passengers, but unfortunately he was arrested and thrust into\r\nprison in Norfolk, Va., to await trial. Having no confidence in his\r\nattorney there he found that he would have to defend himself as best he\r\ncould, consequently he wanted books, etc. He was in the attitude of a\r\ndrowning man catching at a straw. The Committee was powerless to aid\r\nhim, except with some money; as the books that he desired had but little\r\neffect in the lions' den, in which he was. He had his trial, and was\r\nsent to the penitentiary, of course.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD.--Ran away from the subscriber,\r\n    living in Rockville. Montgomery county, Md., on Saturday, 31st\r\n    of May last, NEGRO MAN, ALFRED, about twenty-two years of age;\r\n    five feet seven inches high; dark copper color, and rather good\r\n    looking.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    He had on when he left a dark blue and green plaid frock coat,\r\n    of cloth, and lighter colored plaid pantaloons.\r\n\r\n    I will give the above reward if taken out of the county, and in\r\n    any of the States, or fifty dollars if taken in the county or\r\n    the District of Columbia, and secured so that I get him again.\r\n    JOHN W. ANDERSON.\r\n\r\n    j6-1wW2.\r\n\r\n\r\nA man calling himself Alfred Homer, answering to the above description,\r\ncame to the Vigilance Committee in June, 1856. As a memorial we\r\ntransferred the advertisement of John W. Anderson to our record book,\r\nand concluded to let that suffice. Alfred, however, gave a full\r\ndescription of his master's character, and the motives which impelled\r\nhim to seek his freedom. He was listened to attentively, but his story\r\nwas not entered on the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPASSENGERS FROM MARYLAND, 1857.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HENRY MOODY, BELINDA BIVANS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam was about twenty years of age, black, usual size, and a lover of\r\nliberty. He had heard of Canada, had formed a very favorable opinion of\r\nthe country and was very desirous of seeing it. The man who had\r\nhabitually robbed him of his hire, was a \"stout-built, ill-natured man,\"\r\na farmer, by the name of William Hyson.\r\n\r\nTo meet the expenses of an extensive building enterprise which he had\r\nundertaken, it was apparent that Hyson would have to sell some of his\r\nproperty. William and some six others of the servants got wind of the\r\nfact that they would stand a chance of being in the market soon. Not\r\nrelishing the idea of going further South they unanimously resolved to\r\nemigrate to Canada. Accordingly they borrowed a horse from Dr. Wise, and\r\nanother from H.K. Tice, and a carriage from F.J. Posey, and Joseph P.\r\nMong's buggy (so it was stated in the Baltimore Sun, of May 27th), and\r\noff they started for the promised land. The horses and carriages were\r\nall captured at Chambersburg, a day or two after they set out, but the\r\nrest of the property hurried on to the Committee. How Mr. Hyson raised\r\nthe money to carry out his enterprise, William and his \"ungrateful\"\r\nfellow-servants seemed not to be concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBelinda Bivans. Belinda was a large woman, thirty years of age, wholly\r\nblack, and fled from Mr. Hyson, in company with William, and those above\r\nreferred to, with the idea of reaching Canada, whither her father had\r\nfled eight years before.\r\n\r\nShe was evidently pleased with the idea of getting away from her\r\nill-natured mistress, from poor fare and hard work without pay. She had\r\nexperienced much hardship, and had become weary of her trial in bondage.\r\nShe had been married, but her husband had died, leaving her with two\r\nlittle girls to care for, both of whom she succeeded in bringing away\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the church relations of her master and mistress, she\r\nrepresented the former as a backslider, and added that money was his\r\nchurch; of the latter she said, \"she would go and take the sacrament,\r\ncome back and the old boy would be in her as big as a horse.\" Belinda\r\ncould see but little difference between her master and mistress.\r\n\r\nJoseph Winston. In the Richmond Dispatch, of June 9th, the following\r\nadvertisement was found:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD.--Ran away from the subscriber,\r\n    RUNAWAY.--$200 REWARD will be given if taken in the state, and\r\n    $500 if taken out of the state.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    Run away, my negro boy JOE, sometimes called JOE WINSTON; about\r\n    23 years old, a little over 5 feet high, rather stout-built,\r\n    dark ginger-bread color, small moustache, stammers badly when\r\n    confused or spoken to, took along two or three suits of clothes,\r\n    one a blue dress coat with brass buttons, black pants, and\r\n    patent leather shoes, white hat, silver watch with gold chain;\r\n    was last seen in this city on Tuesday last, had a pass to\r\n    Hanover county, and supposed to be making his way towards York\r\n    River, for the purpose of getting on board some coasting vessel.\r\n\r\n    SAMUEL ELLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe passenger above described reached the Underground Rail Road station,\r\nJune 6th, 1857.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you leave your master?\" said a member of the Committee to Joe.\r\n\"I left because there was no enjoyment in slavery for colored people.\"\r\nAfter stating how the slaves were treated he added, \"I was working all\r\nthe time for master and he was receiving all my money for my daily\r\nlabor.\" \"What business did your master follow?\" inquired the Committee.\r\n\"He was a carpenter by trade.\" \"What kind of a looking man was he?\"\r\nagain inquired the Committee. \"He was a large, stout man, don't swear,\r\nbut lies and cheats.\" Joe admitted that he had been treated very well\r\nall his life, with the exception of being deprived of his freedom. For\r\neight years prior to his escape he had been hired out, a part of the\r\ntime as porter in a grocery store, the remainder as bar-tender in a\r\nsaloon. At the time of his escape he was worth twenty-two dollars per\r\nmonth to his master. Joe had to do overwork and thus procure clothing\r\nfor himself.\r\n\r\nWhen a small boy he resolved, that he never would work all his days as a\r\nslave for the white people. As he advanced in years his desire for\r\nfreedom increased. An offer of fifteen hundred dollars was made for Joe,\r\nso he was informed a short time before he escaped; this caused him to\r\nmove promptly in the matter of carrying out his designs touching\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nHis parents and three brothers, slaves, were to be left; but when the\r\ndecisive hour came he was equal to the emergency. In company with\r\nWilliam Naylor secreted in a vessel, he was brought away and delivered\r\nto the Committee for aid and counsel, which he received, and thus ended\r\nhis bondage. The reward offered by his master, Samuel Ellis, proved of\r\nno avail.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Scott. William was about twenty-four years of age, well made,\r\nthough not very heavy--stammered considerably when speaking--wide awake\r\nand sensible nevertheless. For two years the fear of being sold had not\r\nbeen out of his mind. To meet a security agreement, which had been\r\ncontracted by his mistress--about which a law-suit had been pending for\r\ntwo years--was what he feared he should be sold for. About the first of\r\nMay he found himself in the hands of the sheriff. On being taken to\r\nStafford Court-House Jail, however, the sheriff permitted him to walk a\r\n\"little ways.\" It occurred to William that then was his only chance to\r\nstrike for freedom and Canada, at all hazards. He soon decided the\r\nmatter, and the sheriff saw no more of him.\r\n\r\nSusan Fox was the name of the person he was compelled to call mistress.\r\nShe was described as a \"large, portly woman, very gross, with a\r\ntolerably severe temper, at times.\" William's mother and one of his\r\nbrothers had been sold by this woman--an outrage to be forever\r\nremembered. His grandmother, one sister, with two children, and a cousin\r\nwith five children, all attached by the sheriff, for sale, were left in\r\nthe hands of his mistress. He was married the previous Christmas, but in\r\nthe trying hour could do nothing for his wife, but leave her to the\r\nmercy of slave-holders. The name of the sheriff that he outgeneralled\r\nwas Walter Cox. William was valued at $1,000.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, after all, but few appreciated the sorrow that must have filled\r\nthe hearts of most of those who escaped. Though they succeeded in\r\ngaining their own liberty--they were not insensible to the oppression of\r\ntheir friends and relatives left in bondage. On reaching Canada and\r\ntasting the sweets of freedom, the thought of dear friends in bondage\r\nmust have been acutely painful.\r\n\r\nWilliam had many perils to encounter. On one occasion he was hotly\r\nchased, but proved too fleet-footed for his pursuers. At another time,\r\nwhen straitened, he attempted to swim a river, but failed. His faith\r\nremained strong, nevertheless, and he succeeded in reaching the\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM WASHINGTON, D.C., etc., 1857.\r\n\r\nGEORGE CARROLL, RANDOLPH BRANSON, JOHN CLAGART, AND WILLIAM ROYAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese four journeyed from \"Egypt\" together--but did not leave the same\r\n\"kind protector.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge was a full black, ordinary size, twenty-four years of age, and a\r\nconvert to the doctrine that he had a right to himself. For years the\r\nidea of escape had been daily cherished. Five times he had proposed to\r\nbuy himself, but failed to get the consent of his \"master,\" who was a\r\nmerchant, C.C. Hirara, a man about sixty years of age, and a member of\r\nthe Methodist Church. His property in slaves consisted of two men, two\r\nwomen, two girls and a boy.\r\n\r\nThree of George's brothers escaped to Canada many years prior to his\r\nleaving--there he hoped on his arrival to find them in the possession of\r\ngood farms. $1,300 walked off in the person of George.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRandolph, physically, was a superior man. He was thirty-one years of age\r\nand of a dark chestnut color. Weary with bondage he came to the\r\nconclusion that he had served a master long enough \"without privileges.\"\r\nAgainst his master, Richard Reed, he had no hard things to say, however.\r\nHe was not a \"crabbed, cross man\"--had but \"little to say,\" but \"didn't\r\nbelieve in freedom.\"\r\n\r\nThree of his brothers had been sold South. Left his father, two sisters\r\nand one brother. Randolph was worth probably $1,700.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn was a well-made yellow man, twenty-two years of age, who had\r\ncounted the cost of slavery thoroughly, besides having experienced the\r\neffects of it. Accordingly he resolved to \"be free or die,\" \"to kill or\r\nbe killed, in trying to reach free land somewhere!\"\r\n\r\nHaving \"always been hired out amongst very hard white people,\" he was\r\n\"unhappy.\" His owner, George Coleman, lived near Fairfax, Va., and was a\r\nmember of the Methodist Church, but in his ways was \"very sly,\" and\r\n\"deadly against anything like Freedom.\" He held fifteen of his\r\nfellow-men in chains.\r\n\r\nFor John's hire he received one hundred and fifty dollars a year. He\r\nwas, therefore, ranked with first-class \"stock,\" valued at $1,500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam was about thirty-five years of age, neat, and pleasing in his\r\nmanners. He would be the first selected in a crowd by a gentleman or a\r\nlady, who might want a very neat-looking man to attend to household\r\naffairs. Though he considered Captain Cunningham, his master, a\r\n\"tolerable fair man,\" he was not content to be robbed of his liberty and\r\nearnings. As he felt that he \"could take care of himself,\" he decided to\r\nlet the Captain have the same chance--and so he steered his course\r\nstraight for Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM UNIONVILLE, 1857.\r\n\r\nISRAEL TODD, AND BAZIL ALDRIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIsrael was twenty-three years of age, yellow, tall, well made and\r\nintelligent. He fled from Frederick county, Md. Through the sweat of his\r\nbrow, Dr. Greenberry Sappington and his family had been living at ease.\r\nThe doctor was a Catholic, owning only one other, and was said to be a\r\nman of \"right disposition.\" His wife, however, was \"so mean that nobody\r\ncould stay with her.\" Israel was prompted to escape to save his wife,\r\n(had lately been married) and her brother from being sold south. His\r\ndetestation of slavery in every shape was very decided. He was a\r\nvaluable man, worth to a trader fifteen hundred dollars, perhaps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBazil was only seventeen years of age. About as near a kin to the \"white\r\nfolks\" as to the colored people, and about as strong an opponent of\r\nslavery as any \"Saxon\" going of his age. He was a brother-in-law of\r\nIsrael, and accompanied him on the Underground Rail Road. Bazil was held\r\nto service or labor by Thornton Pool, a store-keeper, and also farmer,\r\nand at the same time an ardent lover of the \"cretur,\" so much so that\r\n\"he kept about half-drunk all the time.\" So Bazil affirmed. The good\r\nspirit moved two of Bazil's brothers to escape the spring before. A few\r\nmonths afterwards a brother and sister were sold south. To manage the\r\nmatter smoothly, previous to selling them, the master pretended that he\r\nwas \"only going to hire them out a short distance from home.\" But\r\ninstead of doing so he sold them south. Bazil might be put down at nine\r\nhundred dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND, 1857.\r\n\r\nORDEE LEE, AND RICHARD J. BOOCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth of these passengers came from Maryland. Ordee was about thirty-five\r\nyears of age, gingerbread color, well made, and intelligent. Being\r\nallowed no chances to make anything for himself, was the excuse offered\r\nfor his escape. Though, as will appear presently, other causes also\r\nhelped to make him hate his oppression.\r\n\r\nThe man who had daily robbed him, and compelled him to call him master,\r\nwas a notorious \"gambler,\" by the name of Elijah Thompson, residing in\r\nMaryland. \"By his bad habits he had run through with his property,\r\nthough in society he stood pretty tolerably high amongst some people;\r\nthen again some didn't like him, he was a mean man, all for himself. He\r\nwas a man that didn't care anything about his servants, except to get\r\nwork out of them. When he came where the servants were working, he would\r\nsnap and bite at them and if he said anything at all, it was to hurry\r\nthe work on.\"\r\n\r\n\"He never gave me,\" said Ordee, \"a half a dollar in his life. Didn't\r\nmore than half feed, said that meat and fish was too high to eat. As for\r\nclothing, he never gave me a new hat for every day, nor a Sunday rag in\r\nhis life.\" Of his mistress, he said, \"She was stingy and close,--made\r\nhim (his master) worse than what he would have been.\" Two of his\r\nbrothers were sold to Georgia, and his uncle was cheated out of his\r\nfreedom. Left three brothers and two sisters in chains. Elijah Thompson\r\nhad at least fifteen hundred dollars less to sport upon by this bold\r\nstep on the part of Ordee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard was about twenty-two years of age, well grown, and a very\r\nlikely-looking article, of a chestnut color, with more than common\r\nintelligence for a slave.\r\n\r\nHis complaints were that he had been treated \"bad,\" allowed \"no\r\nprivileges\" to make anything, allowed \"no Sunday clothing,\" &c. So he\r\nleft the portly-looking Dr. Hughes, with no feeling of indebtedness or\r\nregret. And as to his \"cross and ill-natured\" mistress, with her four\r\nchildren, they might whistle for his services and support. His master\r\nhad, however, some eighteen or twenty others to rob for the support of\r\nhimself and family, so they were in no great danger of starving.\r\n\r\n\"Would your owner be apt to pursue you?\" said a member of the Committee.\r\n\"I don't think he will. He was after two uncles of mine, one time, saw\r\nthem, and talked with them, but was made to run.\"\r\n\r\nRichard left behind his mother, step-father, two sisters, and one\r\nbrother. As a slave, he would have been considered cheap at sixteen\r\nhundred dollars. He was a fine specimen.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM CAMBRIDGE, 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSilas Long and Solomon Light. Silas and Solomon both left together from\r\nCambridge, Md.\r\n\r\nSilas was quite black, spare-built and about twenty-seven years of age.\r\nHe was owned by Sheriff Robert Bell, a man about \"sixty years of age,\r\nand had his name up to be the hardest man in the county.\" \"The Sheriff's\r\nwife was about pretty much such a woman as he was a man--there was not a\r\npin's point of difference between them.\" The fear of having to be sold\r\ncaused this Silas to seek the Underground Rail Road. Leaving his mother,\r\none brother and one cousin, and providing himself with a Bowie-knife and\r\na few dollars in money, he resolved to reach Canada, \"or die on the\r\nway.\" Of course, when slaves reached this desperate point, the way to\r\nCanada was generally found.\r\n\r\nSolomon was about twenty-three years of age, a good-natured-looking\r\n\"article,\" who also left Cambridge, and the protection of a certain\r\nWillis Branick, described as an \"unaccountable mean man.\" \"He never gave\r\nme any money in his life,\" said Sol., \"but spent it pretty freely for\r\nliquor.\" \"He would not allow enough to eat, or clothing sufficient.\" And\r\nhe sold Sol.'s brother the year before he fled, \"because he could not\r\nwhip him.\" The fear of being sold prompted Sol. to flee. The very day he\r\nescaped he had a serious combat with two of his master's sons. The thumb\r\nof one of them being \"badly bit,\" and the other used roughly--the ire of\r\nthe master and sons was raised to a very high degree--and the verdict\r\nwent forth that \"Sol. should be sold to-morrow.\" Unhesitatingly, he\r\nstarted for the Underground Rail Road and Canada--and his efforts were\r\nnot in vain. Damages, $1,500.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THE MOTHER OF TWELVE CHILDREN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD JANE DAVIS--FLED TO ESCAPE THE AUCTION-BLOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appended letter, from Thomas Garrett, will serve to introduce one of\r\nthe most remarkable cases that it was our privilege to report or assist:\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILMINGTON, 6 mo., 9th, 1857.\r\n\r\n    ESTEEMED FRIEND--WILLIAM STILL:--We have here in this place, at\r\n    Comegys Munson's an old colored woman, the mother of twelve\r\n    children, one half of which has been sold South. She has been so\r\n    ill used, that she was compelled to leave husband and children\r\n    behind, and is desirous of getting to a brother who lives at\r\n    Buffalo. She was nearly naked. She called at my house on 7th day\r\n    night, but being from home, did not see her till last evening. I\r\n    have procured her two under garments, one new; two skirts, one\r\n    new; a good frock with cape; one of my wife's bonnets and\r\n    stockings, and gave her five dollars in gold, which, if properly\r\n    used, will put her pretty well on the way. I also gave her a\r\n    letter to thee. Since I gave them to her she has concluded to\r\n    stay where she is till 7th day night, when Comegys Munson says\r\n    he can leave his work and will go with her to thy house. I write\r\n    this so that thee may be prepared for them; they ought to arrive\r\n    between 11 and 12 o'clock. Perhaps thee may find some fugitive\r\n    that will be willing to accompany her. With desire for thy\r\n    welfare and the cause of the oppressed, I remain thy friend,\r\n\r\n    THOS. GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nJane did not know how old she was. She was probably sixty or seventy.\r\nShe fled to keep from being sold. She had been \"whipt right smart,\"\r\npoorly fed and poorly clothed, by a certain Roger McZant, of the New\r\nMarket District, Eastern Shore of Maryland. His wife was a \"bad woman\r\ntoo.\" Just before escaping, Jane got a whisper that her \"master\" was\r\nabout to sell her; on asking him if the rumor was true, he was silent.\r\nHe had been asking \"one hundred dollars\" for her.\r\n\r\nRemembering that four of her children had been snatched away from her\r\nand sold South, and she herself was threatened with the same fate, she\r\nwas willing to suffer hunger, sleep in the woods for nights and days,\r\nwandering towards Canada, rather than trust herself any longer under the\r\nprotection of her \"kind\" owner. Before reaching a place of repose she\r\nwas _three weeks in the woods_, almost wholly without nourishment.\r\n\r\nJane, doubtless, represented thousands of old slave mothers, who, after\r\nhaving been worn out under the yoke, were frequently either offered for\r\nsale for a trifle, turned off to die, or compelled to eke out their\r\nexistence on the most stinted allowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN ROSS, AND HIS WIFE HARRIET.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLED FROM CAROLINE COUNTY, EASTERN SHORE OF MARYLAND, JUNE, 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis party stated that Dr. Anthony Thompson had claimed them as his\r\nproperty. They gave the Committee a pretty full report of how they had\r\nbeen treated in slavery, especially under the doctor. A few of the\r\ninteresting points were noted as follows: The doctor owned about twenty\r\nhead of slaves when they left; formerly he had owned a much larger\r\nnumber, but circumstances had led him to make frequent sales during the\r\nfew years previous to their escape, by which the stock had been reduced.\r\nAs well as having been largely interested in slaves, he had at the same\r\ntime been largely interested in real estate, to the extent of a dozen\r\nfarms at least. But in consequence of having reached out too far,\r\nseveral of his farms had slipped out of his hands.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, Benjamin pronounced him a rough man towards his slaves,\r\nand declared, that he had not given him a dollar since the death of his\r\n(the master's) father, which had been at least twenty years prior to\r\nBenjamin's escape. But Ben. did not stop here, he went on to speak of\r\nthe religious character of his master, and also to describe him\r\nphysically; he was a Methodist preacher, and had been \"pretending to\r\npreach for twenty years.\" Then the fact that a portion of their children\r\nhad been sold to Georgia by this master was referred to with much\r\nfeeling by Ben and his wife; likewise the fact that he had stinted them\r\nfor food and clothing, and led them a rough life generally, which left\r\nthem no room to believe that he was anything else than \"a wolf in\r\nsheep's clothing.\" They described him as a \"spare-built man, bald head,\r\nwearing a wig.\"\r\n\r\nThese two travelers had nearly reached their three score years and ten\r\nunder the yoke. Nevertheless they seemed delighted at the idea of going\r\nto a free country to enjoy freedom, if only for a short time. Moreover\r\nsome of their children had escaped in days past, and these they hoped to\r\nfind. Not many of those thus advanced in years ever succeeded in getting\r\nto Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM VIRGINIA, 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam was about fifty years of age, of usual size, of good address,\r\nand intelligent. He was born the property of a slaveholder, by the name\r\nof Daniel Minne, residing in Alexandria in Virginia. His master was\r\nabout eighty-four years of age, and was regarded as kind, though he had\r\nsold some of his slaves and was in favor of slavery. He had two sons,\r\nRobert and Albert, \"both dissipated, would layabout the tippling\r\ntaverns, and keep low company, so much so that they were not calculated\r\nto do any business for their father.\" William had to be a kind of a\r\nright hand man to his master. The sons seeing that the \"property\" was\r\ntrusted instead of themselves, very naturally hated it, so the young men\r\nresolved that at the death of their father, William should be sent as\r\nfar south as possible. Knowing that the old man could not stand it much\r\nlonger, William saw that it was his policy to get away as fast as he\r\ncould. He was the husband of a free wife, who had come on in advance of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nFor thirty years William had been foreman on his old master's\r\nplantation, and but for the apprehension caused by the ill-will of his\r\nprospective young masters, he would doubtless have remained in servitude\r\nat least until the death of the old man. But when William reflected, and\r\nsaw what he had been deprived of all his life by being held in bondage,\r\nand when he began to breathe free air, with the prospect of ending his\r\ndays on free land, he rejoiced that his eyes had been opened to see his\r\ndanger, and that he had been moved to make a start for liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM DELAWARE, 1857.\r\n\r\nJOHN WRIGHT AND WIFE, ELIZABETH ANN, AND CHARLES CONNOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis party arrived from Sussex county. John was about thirty years of\r\nage, ordinary size, full black and clear-headed. In physical appearance\r\nhe would have readily passed for a superior laborer. The keenness of his\r\neyes and quickness of his perception, however, would doubtless have\r\nrendered him an object of suspicion in some parts of the South. The\r\ntruth was that the love of liberty was clearly indicated in his\r\nexpressive countenance. William S. Phillips, a farmer, had been\r\n\"sucking\" John's blood, and keeping him poor and ignorant for the last\r\neight years at least; before that, Phillips' father had defrauded him of\r\nhis hire.\r\n\r\nUnder the father and son John had found plenty of hard work and bad\r\nusage, severe and repeated floggings not excepted. Old master and\r\nmistress and young master and mistress, including the entire family,\r\nbelonged to what was known as the \"Farmer church,\" at Portsville.\r\nOutwardly they were good Christians. \"Occasionally,\" John said, \"the old\r\nman would have family prayers,\" and to use John's own words, \"in company\r\nhe would try to moralize, but out of company was as great a rowdy as\r\never was.\" In further describing his old master, he said that he was a\r\nlarge man, with a red face and blunt nose, and was very quick and fiery\r\nin his temper; would drink and swear--and even his wife, with all hands,\r\nwould have to run when he was \"raised.\"\r\n\r\nOf his young master he said: \"He was quite a long-bodied, thin-faced\r\nman, weighing over one hundred and fifty pounds. In temper just like his\r\nfather, though he did not drink--that is all the good quality that I can\r\nrecommend in him.\" John said also that his master, on one occasion, in a\r\nmost terribly angry mood, threatened that he would \"wade up to his knees\r\nin his (John's) blood.\" It so happened that John's blood was up pretty\r\nhigh just at that time; he gave his master to understand that he would\r\nrather go South (be sold) than submit to the scourging which was\r\nimminent. John's pluck probably had the effect of allaying the master's\r\nfire; at any rate the storm subsided after awhile, and until the day\r\nthat he took the Underground Rail Road car the servant managed to put up\r\nwith his master. As John's wife was on the eve of being sold he was\r\nprompted to leave some time sooner than he otherwise would have done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WIFE'S STATEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was thirty-two years of age, of good physical proportions, and a\r\npromising-looking person, above the ordinary class of slaves belonging\r\nto Delaware. She was owned by Jane Cooper, who lived near Laurel, in\r\nSussex county. She had been more accustomed to field labor than\r\nhouse-work; ploughing, fencing, driving team, grubbing, cutting wood,\r\netc., were well understood by her. During \"feeding times\" she had to\r\nassist in the house. In this respect, she had harder times than the men.\r\nHer mistress was also in the habit of hiring Elizabeth out by the day to\r\nwash. On these occasions she was required to rise early enough to milk\r\nthe cows, get breakfast, and feed the hogs before sunrise, so that she\r\nmight be at her day's washing in good time.\r\n\r\nIt is plainly to be seen, that Elizabeth had not met with the \"ease\" and\r\nkindness which many claimed for the slave. Elizabeth was sensible of the\r\nwrongs inflicted by her Delaware mistress, and painted her in very vivid\r\ncolors. Her mistress was a widow, \"quite old,\" but \"very frisky,\" and\r\n\"wore a wig to hide her gray hairs.\" At the death of her husband, the\r\nslaves believed, from what they had heard their master say, that they\r\nwould be freed, each at the age of thirty. But no will was found, which\r\ncaused Elizabeth, as well as the rest of the slaves, to distrust the\r\nmistress more than ever, as they suspected that she knew something of\r\nits disappearance.\r\n\r\nHer mistress belonged to the Presbyterian Church, but would have \"family\r\nprayers only when the minister would stop;\" Elizabeth thought that she\r\ntook greater pains to please the minister than her Maker. Elizabeth had\r\nno faith in such religion.\r\n\r\nBoth Elizabeth and her husband were members of the Methodist Church.\r\nNeither had ever been permitted to learn to read or write, but they were\r\nnaturally very smart. John left his mother and one sister in bondage.\r\nOne of his brothers fled to Canada fifteen years before their escape.\r\nHis name was Abraham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Connor, the third person in the party, was twenty-seven years of\r\nage--fast color, and a tough-looking \"article,\" who would have brought\r\ntwelve hundred dollars or more in the hands of a Baltimore trader. The\r\nman from whom Charles fled was known by the name of John Chipman, and\r\nwas described as \"a fleshy man, with rank beard and quick temper, very\r\nhard--commonly kept full of liquor, though he would not get so drunk\r\nthat he could not go about.\" For a long time Charles had been the main\r\ndependence on his master's place, as he only owned two other slaves.\r\nCharles particularly remarked, that no weather was too bad for them to\r\nbe kept at work in the field. Charles was a fair specimen of the\r\n\"corn-field hand,\" but thought that he could take care of himself in\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM ALEXANDRIA, 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSCAR D. BALL, AND MONTGOMERY GRAHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD.--Ran away from the owner in\r\n    Alexandria, Va., on the night of the 13th inst., two young negro\r\n    men, from twenty to twenty-five years of age. MONTGOMERY is a\r\n    very bright mulatto, about five feet, six inches in height, of\r\n    polite manners, and smiles much when speaking or spoken to.\r\n    OSCAR is of a tawny complexion, about six feet high, sluggish in\r\n    his appearance and movements, and of awkward manners. One\r\n    hundred dollars each will be paid for the delivery of the above\r\n    slaves if taken in a slave state, or two hundred dollars each if\r\n    taken in a free state. One or more slaves belonging to other\r\n    owners, it is supposed, went in their company.\r\n\r\n    Address:  JOHN T. GORDON,\r\n\r\n    Alexandria, Va.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the name of John T. Gordon appears signed to the above\r\nadvertisement, he was not the owner of Montgomery and Oscar. According\r\nto their own testimony they belonged to a maiden lady, by the name of\r\nMiss Elizabeth Gordon, who probably thought that the business of\r\nadvertising for runaway negroes was rather beneath her.\r\n\r\nWhile both these passengers manifested great satisfaction in leaving\r\ntheir mistress they did not give her a bad name. On the contrary they\r\ngave her just such a character as the lady might have been pleased with\r\nin the main. They described her thus: \"Mistress was a spare woman,\r\ntolerably tall, and very kind, except when sick, she would not pay much\r\nattention then. She was a member of the Southern Methodist Church, and\r\nwas strict in her religion.\"\r\n\r\nHaving a good degree of faith in his mistress, Oscar made bold one day\r\nto ask her how much she would take for him. She agreed to take eight\r\nhundred dollars. Oscar wishing to drive a pretty close bargain offered\r\nher seven hundred dollars, hoping that she would view the matter in a\r\nreligious light, and would come down one hundred dollars. After\r\nreflection instead of making a reduction, she raised the amount to one\r\nthousand dollars, which Oscar concluded was too much for himself. It was\r\nnot, however, as much as he was worth according to his mistress'\r\nestimate, for she declared that she had often been offered fifteen\r\nhundred dollars for him. Miss Gordon raised Oscar from a child and had\r\ntreated him as a pet. When he was a little \"shaver\" seven or eight years\r\nof age, she made it a practice to have him sleep with her, showing that\r\nshe had no prejudice.\r\n\r\nBeing rather of a rare type of slave-holders she is entitled to special\r\ncredit. Montgomery the companion of Oscar could scarcely be\r\ndistinguished from the white folks. In speaking of his mistress,\r\nhowever, he did not express himself in terms quite so complimentary as\r\nOscar. With regard to giving \"passes,\" he considered her narrow, to say\r\nthe least. But he was in such perfectly good humor with everybody, owing\r\nto the fact that he had succeeded in getting his neck out of the yoke,\r\nthat he evidently had no desire to say hard things about her.\r\n\r\nJudging from his story he had been for a long time desiring his freedom\r\nand looking diligently for the Underground Rail Road, but he had had\r\nmany things to contend with when looking the matter of escape in the\r\nface. Arriving in Philadelphia, and finding himself breathing free air,\r\nreceiving aid and encouragement in a manner that he had never known\r\nbefore, he was one of the happiest of creatures.\r\n\r\nOscar left his wife and one child, one brother and two sisters.\r\nMontgomery left one sister, but no other near kin.\r\n\r\nInstead of going to Canada, Oscar and his comrade pitched their tents in\r\nOswego, N.Y., where they changed their names, and instead of returning\r\nthemselves to their kind mistress they were wicked enough to be plotting\r\nas to how some of their friends might get off on the Underground Rail\r\nRoad, as may be seen from the appended letters from Oscar, who was\r\nthought to be sluggish, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n    OSWEGO, Oct 25th, 1857.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:--I take this opportunity of writing you these few\r\n    lines to inform you that I am well and hope these few lines will\r\n    find you the same (and your family you must excuse me for not\r\n    writing to you before.

She fled from Thornton Poole, of Unionville,\r\nMd. She gave her master the character of being a \"very mean man; with a\r\nwife meaner still,\" \"I consider them mean in every respect,\" said\r\nCaroline. No great while before she escaped, one of her brothers and a\r\nsister had been sent to the Southern market. Recently she had been\r\napprized that herself and a younger brother would have to go the same\r\ndreadful road. She therefore consulted with the brother and a particular\r\nyoung friend, to whom she was \"engaged,\" which resulted in the departure\r\nof all three of them. Though the ordinary steps relative to marriage, as\r\nfar as slaves were allowed, had been complied with, nevertheless on the\r\nroad to Canada, they availed themselves of the more perfect way of\r\nhaving the ceremony performed, and went on their way rejoicing.\r\n\r\nSince the sale of Caroline's brother and sister, just referred to, her\r\nmother and three children had made good their exit to Canada, having\r\nbeen evidently prompted by said sale. Long before that time, however,\r\nthree other brothers fled on the Underground Rail Road. They were\r\nencouraged to hope to meet each other in Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN WOOD. John was about twenty-eight years of age, of agreeable\r\nmanners, intelligent, and gave evidence of a strong appreciation of\r\nliberty. Times with John had \"not been very rough,\" until within the\r\nlast year of his bondage. By the removal of his old master by death, a\r\nchange for the worse followed. The executors of the estate--one of whom\r\nowed him an old grudge--made him acquainted with the fact, that amongst\r\ncertain others, he would have to be sold. Judge Birch (one of the\r\nexecutors), \"itching\" to see him \"broke in,\" \"took particular pains\" to\r\nspeak to a notorious tyrant by the name of Boldin, to buy him.\r\nAccordingly on the day of sale, Boldin was on hand and the successful\r\nbidder for John. Being familiar with, the customs of this terrible\r\nBoldin,--of the starving fare and cruel flogging usual on his farm, John\r\nmustered courage to declare at the sale, that he \"_would not serve\r\nhim_.\" In the hearing of his new master, he said, \"_before I will serve\r\nhim I will_ CUT _my throat_!\" The master smiled, and simply asked for a\r\nrope; \"had me tied and delivered into the hands of a constable,\" to be\r\nsent over to the farm. Before reaching his destination, John managed to\r\nuntie his hands and feet and flee to the woods. For three days he\r\nremained secreted. Once or twice he secretly managed to get an interview\r\nwith his mother and one of his sisters, by whom he was persuaded to\r\nreturn to his master. Taking their advice, he commenced service under\r\ncircumstances, compared with which, the diet, labor and comforts of an\r\nordinary penitentiary would have been luxurious. The chief food allowed\r\nthe slaves on the plantation consisted of the pot liquor in which the\r\npork was boiled, with Indian-meal bread. The merest glance at what he\r\nexperienced during his brief stay on the plantation must suffice. In the\r\nfield where John, with a number of others was working, stood a hill, up\r\nwhich they were repeatedly obliged to ascend, with loads on their backs,\r\nand the overseer at their heels, with lash in hand, occasionally\r\nslashing at first one and then another; to keep up, the utmost physical\r\nendurance was taxed. John, though a stout young man, and having never\r\nknown any other condition than that of servitude, nevertheless found\r\nhimself quite unequal to the present occasion. \"I was surprised,\" said\r\nhe, \"to see the expertness with which all flew up the hill.\" \"_One\r\nwoman, quite_ LUSTY, _unfit to be out of the house, on_ RUNNING UP THE\r\nHILL, fell; in a moment she was up again with her brush on her back, and\r\nan hour afterwards the overseer was whipping her.\" \"My turn came.\" \"What\r\nis the reason you can't get up the hill faster?\" exclaimed the overseer,\r\nat the same time he struck me with a cowhide. \"I told him I would not\r\nstand it.\" \"Old Uncle George Washington never failed to get a whipping\r\nevery day.\"\r\n\r\nSo after serving at this only a few days, John made his last solemn vow\r\nto be free or die; and off he started for Canada. Though he had to\r\ncontend with countless difficulties he at last made the desired haven.\r\nHe hailed from one of the lower counties of Maryland.\r\n\r\nJohn was not contented to enjoy the boon alone, but like a true lover of\r\nfreedom he remembered those in bonds as bound with them, and so was\r\nscheming to make a hazardous \"adventure\" South, on the express errand of\r\ndelivering his \"family,\" as the subjoined letter will show:\r\n\r\n\r\n    GLANDFORD, August 15th, 1858.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:--I received your letter and was glad to hear that your\r\n    wife and family was all well and I hope it will continue so. I\r\n    am glad to inform you that this leaves me well. Also, Mr. Wm.\r\n    Still, I want for you to send me your opinion respecting my\r\n    circumstances. I have made up my mind to make an adventure after\r\n    my family and I want to get an answer from you and then I shall\r\n    know how to act and then I will send to you all particulars\r\n    respecting my starting to come to your house. Mr. Still I should\r\n    be glad to know whare Abraham Harris is, as I should be as glad\r\n    to see him as well as any of my own brothers. His wife and my\r\n    wife's mother is sisters. My wife belongs to Elson Burdel's\r\n    estate. Abraham's wife belongs to Sam Adams. Mr. Still you must\r\n    not think hard of me for writing you these few lines as I cannot\r\n    rest until I release my dear family. I have not the least doubt\r\n    but I can get through without the least trouble. So no more at\r\n    present from your humble servant,\r\n\r\n    JOHN B. WOODS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM NEW ORLEANS, 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES CONNER, SHOT IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY.\r\n\r\n\r\nJames stated to the Committee that he was about forty-three years of\r\nage, that he was born a slave in Nelson county, Ky., and that he was\r\nfirst owned by a widow lady by the name of Ruth Head. \"She (mistress)\r\nwas like a mother to me,\" said Jim. \"I was about sixteen years old when\r\nshe died; the estate was settled and I was sold South to a man named\r\nVincent Turner, a planter, and about the worst man, I expect, that ever\r\nthe sun shined on. His slaves he fairly murdered; two hundred lashes\r\nwere merely a promise for him. He owned about three hundred slaves. I\r\nlived with Turner until he died. After his death I still lived on the\r\nplantation with his widow, Mrs. Virginia Turner.\" About twelve years ago\r\n(prior to Jim's escape) she was married to a Mr. Charles Parlange, \"a\r\npoor man, though a very smart man, bad-hearted, and very barbarous.\"\r\n\r\nBefore her second marriage cotton had always been cultivated, but a few\r\nyears later sugar had taken the place of cotton, and had become the\r\nprincipal thing raised in that part of the country. Under the change\r\nsugar was raised and the slaves were made to experience harder times\r\nthan ever; they were allowed to have only from three to three and a half\r\npounds of pork a week, with a peck of meal; nothing else was allowed.\r\nThey commenced work in the morning, just when they could barely see;\r\nthey quit work in the evening when they could not see to work longer.\r\n\r\nMistress was a large, portly woman, good-looking, and pretty well liked\r\nby her slaves. The place where the plantation was located was at Point\r\nCopee, on Falls River, about one hundred and fifty miles from New\r\nOrleans. She also owned property and about twenty slaves in the city of\r\nNew Orleans.\r\n\r\n\"I lived there and hired my time for awhile. I saw some hard times on\r\nthe plantation. Many a time I have seen slaves whipped almost to\r\ndeath--well, I tell you I have seen them whipped to death. A slave named\r\nSam was whipped to death tied to the ground. Joe, another slave, was\r\nwhipped to death by the overseer: running away was the crime.\r\n\r\n\"Four times I was shot. Once, before I would be taken, all hands, young\r\nand old on the plantation were on the chase after me. I was strongly\r\narmed with an axe, tomahawk, and butcher knife. I expected to be killed\r\non the spot, but I got to the woods and stayed two days. At night I went\r\nback to the plantation and got something to eat. While going back to the\r\nwoods I was shot in the thigh, legs, back and head, was badly wounded,\r\nmy mind was to die rather than be taken. I ran a half mile after I was\r\nshot, but was taken. I have shot in me now. Feel here on my head, feel\r\nmy back, feel buck shot in my thigh. I shall carry shot in me to my\r\ngrave. I have been shot four different times. I was shot twice by a\r\nfellow servant; it was my master's orders. Another time by the overseer.\r\nShooting was no uncommon thing in Louisiana. At one time I was allowed\r\nto raise hogs. I had twenty-five taken from me without being allowed the\r\nfirst copper.\r\n\r\n\"My mistress promised me at another time forty dollars for gathering\r\nhoney, but when I went to her, she said, by and by, but the by and by\r\nnever came. In 1853 my freedom was promised; for five years before this\r\ntime I had been overseer; during four years of this time a visit was\r\nmade to France by my owners, but on their return my freedom was not\r\ngiven me. My mistress thought I had made enough money to buy myself.\r\nThey asked eleven hundred and fifty dollars for me. I told them that I\r\nhadn't the money. Then they said if I would go with them to Virginia\r\nafter a number of slaves they wished to purchase, and would be a good\r\nboy, they would give me my freedom on the return of the trip. We started\r\non the 8th of June, 1857. I made fair promises wishing to travel, and\r\nthey placed all confidence in me. I was to carry the slaves back from\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\n\"They came as far as Baltimore, and they began to talk of coming farther\r\nNorth, to Philadelphia. They talked very good to me, and told me that if\r\nthey brought me with them to a free State that I must not leave them;\r\ntalked a good deal about giving me my freedom, as had been promised\r\nbefore starting, etc. I let on to them that I had no wish to go North;\r\nthat Baltimore was as far North as I wished to see, and that I had\r\nrather be going home than going North. I told them that I was tired of\r\nthis country. In speaking of coming North, they made mention of the\r\nAlleghany mountains. I told them that I would like to see that, but\r\nnothing more. They hated the North, and I made believe that I did too.\r\nMistress said, that if I behaved myself I could go with them to France,\r\nwhen they went again, after they returned home--as they intended to go\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"So they decided to take me with them to Philadelphia, for a short\r\nvisit, before going into Virginia to buy up their drove of slaves for\r\nLouisiana. My heart leaped for joy when I found we were going to a free\r\nState; but I did not let my owners know my feelings.\r\n\r\n\"We reached Philadelphia and went to the Girard Hotel, and there I made\r\nup my mind that they should go back without me. I saw a colored man who\r\ntalked with me, and told me about the Committee. He brought me to the\r\nanti-slavery office,\" etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThe Committee told Jim that he could go free immediately, without saying\r\na word to anybody, as the simple fact of his master's bringing him into\r\nthe State was sufficient to establish his freedom before the Courts. At\r\nthe same time the Committee assured him if he were willing to have his\r\nmaster arrested and brought before one of the Judges of the city to show\r\ncause why he held him a slave in Pennsylvania, contrary to the laws of\r\nthe State, that he should lack neither friends nor money to aid him in\r\nthe matter; and, moreover, his freedom would be publicly proclaimed.\r\n\r\nJim thought well of both ways, but preferred not to meet his\r\n\"kind-hearted\" master and mistress in Court, as he was not quite sure\r\nthat he would have the courage to face them and stand by his charges.\r\n\r\nThis was not strange. Indeed not only slaves cowed before the eye of\r\nslave-holders. Did not even Northern men, superior in education and\r\nwealth, fear to say their souls were their own in the same presence?\r\n\r\nJim, therefore, concluded to throw himself upon the protection of the\r\nCommittee and take an Underground Rail Road ticket, and thereby spare\r\nhimself and his master and mistress the disagreeableness of meeting\r\nunder such strange circumstances. The Committee arranged matters for him\r\nto the satisfaction of all concerned, and gave him a passport for her\r\nBritish majesty's possession, Canada.\r\n\r\nThe unvarnished facts, as they were then recorded substantially from the\r\nlips of Jim, and as they are here reproduced, comprise only a very\r\nmeagre part of his sadly interesting story. At the time Jim left his\r\nmaster and mistress so unceremoniously in Philadelphia, some excitement\r\nexisted at the attempt of his master to recover him through the Police\r\nof Philadelphia, under the charge that he (Jim) had been stealing, as\r\nmay be seen from the following letter which appeared in the \"National\r\nAnti-Slavery Standard:\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER SLAVE HUNT IN PHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Philadelphia, Monday, July_ 27, 1857.\r\n\r\n    Yesterday afternoon a rumor was afloat that a negro man named\r\n    Jim, who had accompanied his master (Mr. Charles Parlange), from\r\n    New Orleans to this city, had left his master for the purpose of\r\n    tasting the sweets of freedom. It was alleged by Mr. Parlange\r\n    that the said \"Jim\" had taken with him two tin boxes, one of\r\n    which contained money. Mr. Parlange went, on his way to New\r\n    York, _viâ_ the Camden and Amboy Railroad, and upon his arrival\r\n    at the Walnut street wharf, with two ladies, \"Jim\" was missing.\r\n    Mr. Parlange immediately made application to a Mr. Wallace, who\r\n    is a Police officer stationed at the Walnut street depot. Mr.\r\n    Wallace got into a carriage with Mr. Parlange and the two\r\n    ladies, and, as Mr. Wallace stated, drove back to the Girard\r\n    House, where \"Jim\" had not been heard of since he had left for\r\n    the Walnut street wharf.\r\n\r\n    A story was then set afloat to the effect, that a negro of\r\n    certain, but very particular description (such as a Louisiana\r\n    nigger-driver only can give), had stolen two boxes as stated\r\n    above. A notice signed \"Clarke,\" was received at the Police\r\n    Telegraph Office by the operator (David Wunderly) containing a\r\n    full description of Jim, also offering a reward of $100 for his\r\n    capture. This notice was telegraphed to all the wards in every\r\n    section. This morning Mr. Wunderly found fault with the\r\n    reporters using the information, and, in presence of some four\r\n    or five persons, said the notice signed \"Clarke,\" was a private\r\n    paper, and no reporter had a right to look at it; at the same\r\n    time asserting, that if he knew where the nigger was he would\r\n    give him up, as $100 did not come along every day. The\r\n    policeman, Wallace, expressed the utmost fear lest the name of\r\n    Mr. Parlange should transpire, and stated, that he was an\r\n    intimate friend of his. It does not seem that the matter was\r\n    communicated to the wards by any official authority whatever,\r\n    and who the \"Clarke\" is, whose name was signed to the notice,\r\n    has not yet transpired. Some of the papers noticed it briefly\r\n    this morning, which has set several of the officers on their\r\n    tips. There is little doubt, that \"Jim\" has merely exercised his\r\n    own judgment about remaining with his master any longer, and\r\n    took this opportunity to betake himself to freedom. It is\r\n    assumed, that he was to precede his master to Walnut street\r\n    wharf with the baggage; but, singular enough to say, no\r\n    complaint has been made about the baggage being missed, simply\r\n    the two tin boxes, and particularly the one containing money.\r\n    This is, doubtless, a ruse to engage the services of the\r\n    Philadelphia police in the interesting game of nigger hunting.\r\n    Mr. Parlange, if he is sojourning in your city, will doubtless\r\n    be glad to learn that the matter of his man \"Jim\" and the two\r\n    tin boxes has received ample publicity. W.H.\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. Hiram Wilson, the Underground Rail Road agent at St. Catharines,\r\nC.W., duly announced his safe arrival as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    BUFFALO, Aug. 12th, 1857.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR FRIEND--WM. STILL:--I take the liberty to inform you,\r\n    that I had the pleasure of seeing a man of sable brand at my\r\n    house in St. C. yesterday, by name of James Connor, lately from\r\n    New Orleans, more recently from the city of Brotherly love,\r\n    where he took French leave of his French master. He desired me\r\n    to inform you of his safe arrival in the glorious land of\r\n    Freedom, and to send his kind regards to you and to Mr.\r\n    Williamson; also to another person, (the name I have forgotten).\r\n    Poor Malinda Smith, with her two little girls and young babe is\r\n    with us doing well.\r\n\r\n    Affectionately yours, HIRAM WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM WASHINGTON, D.C.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARRISON CARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe passenger bearing this name who applied to the Committee for\r\nassistance, was a mulatto of medium size, with a prepossessing\r\ncountenance, and a very smart talker. With only a moderate education he\r\nmight have raised himself to the \"top round of the ladder,\" as a\r\nrepresentative of the down-trodden slave. Seeking, as usual, to learn\r\nhis history, the subjoined questions and answers were the result of the\r\ninterview:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Q. \"How old are you?\"\r\n\r\n    A. \"Twenty-eight years of age this coming March.\"\r\n\r\n    Q. \"To whom did you belong?\"\r\n\r\n    A. \"Mrs. Jane E. Ashley.\"\r\n\r\n    Q. \"What kind of a woman was she?\"\r\n\r\n    A. \"She was a very clever woman; never said anything out of the\r\n    way.\"\r\n\r\n    Q. \"How many servants had she?\"\r\n\r\n    A. \"She had no other servants.\"\r\n\r\n    Q. \"Did you live with her?\"\r\n\r\n    A. \"No. I hired my time for twenty-two dollars a month.\"\r\n\r\n    Q. \"How could you make so much money?\"\r\n\r\n    A. \"I was a bricklayer by trade, and ranked among the first in\r\n    the city.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Harrison talked so intelligently, the member of the Committee who was\r\nexamining him, was anxious to know how he came to be so knowing, the\r\nfact that he could read being very evident.\r\n\r\nHarrison proceeded to explain how he was led to acquire the art both of\r\nreading and writing: \"Slaves caught out of an evening without passes\r\nfrom their master or mistress, were invariably arrested, and if they\r\nwere unable to raise money to buy themselves off, they were taken and\r\nlocked up in a place known as the 'cage,' and in the morning the owner\r\nwas notified, and after paying the fine the unfortunate prisoner had to\r\ngo to meet his fate at the hands of his owner.\"\r\n\r\nOften he or she found himself or herself sentenced to take thirty-nine\r\nor more lashes before atonement could be made for the violated law, and\r\nthe fine sustained by the enraged owner.\r\n\r\nHarrison having strong aversion to both of the \"wholesome regulations\"\r\nof the peculiar institution above alluded to, saw that the only remedy\r\nthat he could avail himself of was to learn to write his own passes. In\r\npossessing himself of this prize he knew that the law against slaves\r\nbeing taught, would have to be broken, nevertheless he was so anxious to\r\nsucceed, that he was determined to run the risk. Consequently he grasped\r\nthe boon with but very little difficulty or assistance. Valuing his\r\nprize highly, he improved more and more until he could write his own\r\npasses satisfactorily. The \"cage\" he denounced as a perfect \"hog hole,\"\r\nand added, \"it was more than I could bear.\"\r\n\r\nHe also spoke with equal warmth on the pass custom, \"the idea of working\r\nhard all day and then being obliged to have a pass,\" etc.,--his feelings\r\nsternly revolted against. Yet he uttered not a disrespectful word\r\nagainst the individual to whom he belonged. Once he had been sold, but\r\nfor what was not noted on the record book.\r\n\r\nHis mother had been sold several times. His brother, William Henry Gary,\r\nescaped from Washington, D.C., when quite a youth. What became of him it\r\nwas not for Harrison to tell, but he supposed that he had made his way\r\nto a free State, or Canada, and he hoped to find him. He had no\r\nknowledge of any other relatives.\r\n\r\nIn further conversation with him, relative to his being a single man, he\r\nsaid, that he had resolved not to entangle himself with a family until\r\nhe had obtained his freedom.\r\n\r\nHe had found it pretty hard to meet his monthly hire, consequently he\r\nwas on the look-out to better his condition as soon as a favorable\r\nopportunity might offer. Harrison's mistress had a son named John James\r\nAshley, who was then a minor. On arriving at majority, according to the\r\nwill of this lad's father, he was to have possession of Harrison as his\r\nportion. Harrison had no idea of having to work for his support--he\r\nthought that, if John could not take care of himself when he grew up to\r\nbe a man, there was a place for all such in the poor-house.\r\n\r\nHarrison was also moved by another consideration. His mistress' sister\r\nhad been trying to influence the mistress to sell him; thus considering\r\nhimself in danger, he made up his mind that the time had come for him to\r\nchange his habitation, so he resolved to try his fortune on the\r\nUnderground Rail Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM VIRGINIA, 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOE ELLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of this sketch was one of two hundred slaves, owned by\r\nBolling Ellis, who possessed large plantations at Cabin Point, Surrey\r\nCo., Va. Joe pictured his master, overseers, and general treatment of\r\nslaves in no favorable light.\r\n\r\nThe practice of punishing slaves by putting them in the stocks and by\r\nflogging, was dwelt upon in a manner that left no room to doubt but that\r\nJoe had been a very great sufferer under his master's iron rule. As he\r\ndescribed the brutal conduct of overseers in resorting to their habitual\r\nmodes of torturing men, women, and children, it was too painful to\r\nlisten to with composure, much more to write down.\r\n\r\nJoe was about twenty-three years of age, full black, slender, and of\r\naverage intellect, considering the class which he represented. On four\r\noccasions previous to the final one he had made fruitless efforts to\r\nescape from his tormentors in consequence of brutal treatment. Although\r\nhe at last succeeded, the severe trials through which he had to pass in\r\nescaping, came very near costing him his life. The effects he will\r\nalways feel; prostration and sickness had already taken hold upon him in\r\na serious degree.\r\n\r\nDuring Joe's sojourn under the care of the Committee, time would not\r\nadmit of the writing out of further details concerning him.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER GREEN AND WIFE, ANN MARIA, AND SON NATHAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nChristopher had a heavy debt charged against Clayton Wright, a\r\ncommission merchant, of Baltimore, who claimed him as his property, and\r\nwas in the habit of hiring him out to farmers in the country, and of\r\ntaking all his hire except a single dollar, which was allotted him every\r\nholiday.\r\n\r\nThe last item in his charge against Wright, suggested certain questions:\r\n\"How have you been used?\" was the first query. \"Sometimes right smart,\r\nand then again bad enough for it,\" said Christopher. Again he was asked,\r\n\"What kind of a man was your master?\" \"He was only tolerable, I can't\r\nsay much good for him. I got tired of working and they getting my labor\r\nand I getting nothing for my labor.\" At the time of his escape, he was\r\nemployed in the service of a man by the name of Cook. Christopher\r\ndescribed him as \"a dissatisfied man, who couldn't be pleased at nothing\r\nand his wife was like him.\"\r\n\r\nThis passenger was quite black, medium size, and in point of intellect,\r\nabout on a par with ordinary field hands. His wife, Ann, in point of\r\ngo-ahead-ativeness, seemed in advance of him. Indeed, she first prompted\r\nher husband to escape.\r\n\r\nAnn bore witness against one James Pipper, a farmer, whom she had served\r\nas a slave, and from whom she fled, saying that \"he was as mean a man as\r\never walked--a dark-complected old man, with gray hair.\" With great\r\nemphasis she thus continued her testimony: \"He tried to work me to\r\ndeath, and treated me as mean as he could, without killing me; he done\r\nso much I couldn't tell to save my life. I wish I had as many dollars as\r\nhe has whipped me with sticks and other things. His wife will do\r\ntolerable.\" \"I left because he was going to sell me and my son to\r\nGeorgia; for years he had been threatening; since the boys ran away,\r\nlast spring, he was harder than ever. One was my brother, Perry, and the\r\nother was a young man by the name of Jim.\" \"David, my master, drank all\r\nhe could get, poured it down, and when drunk, would cuss, and tear, and\r\nrip, and beat. He lives near the nine bridges, in Queen Ann county.\"\r\n\r\nAnn was certainly a forcible narrator, and was in every way a wideawake\r\nwoman, about thirty-seven years of age. Among other questions they were\r\nasked if they could read, etc. \"Read,\" said Ann. \"I would like to see\r\nanybody (slave) that could read our way; to see you with a book in your\r\nhand they would almost cut your throat.\"\r\n\r\nAnn had one child only, a son, twenty years of age, who came in company\r\nwith his parents. This son belonged to the said Pipper already\r\ndescribed. When they started from the land of bondage they had large\r\nhopes, but not much knowledge of the way; however, they managed to get\r\nsafely on the Underground Rail Road track, and by perseverance they\r\nreached the Committee and were aided in the usual manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM GEORGETOWN CROSS-ROADS, 1857.\r\n\r\nLEEDS WRIGHT AND ABRAM TILISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor three years Leeds had been thirsting for his liberty; his heart was\r\nfixed on that one object. He got plenty to eat, drink, and wear, but was\r\nnevertheless dissatisfied.\r\n\r\nThe name of his master was Rev. John Wesley Pearson, who was engaged in\r\nschool teaching and preaching, and belonged to the more moderate class\r\nof slave-holders. Once when a boy Leeds had been sold, but being very\r\nyoung, he did not think much about the matter.\r\n\r\nFor the last eight or ten years previous to his escape he had not seen\r\nhis relatives, his father (George Wright) having fled to Canada, and the\r\nremainder of the family lived some fifty miles distant, beyond the\r\npossibility of intercourse; therefore, as he had no strong ties to\r\nbreak, he could look to the time of leaving the land of bondage without\r\nregret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbram, the companion of Leeds, had been less comfortably situated. His\r\nlot in Slavery had been cast under Samuel Jarman, by whom he had been\r\nbadly treated.\r\n\r\nAbram described him as a \"big, tall, old man, who drank and was a real\r\nwicked man; he followed farming; had thirteen children. His wife was\r\ndifferent; she was a pretty fine woman, but the children were all bad;\r\nthe young masters followed playing cards.\" No chance at all had been\r\nallowed them to learn to read, although Abram and Leeds both coveted\r\nthis knowledge. As they felt that they would never be able to do\r\nanything for their improvement by remaining, they decided to follow the\r\nexample of Abram's father and others and go to Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM ALEXANDRIA.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM TRIPLETT AND THOMAS HARPER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ran away from the subscriber, on Saturday night, 22d instant,\r\n    WILLIAM TRIPLETT, a dark mulatto, with whiskers and mustache, 23\r\n    to 26 years of age; lately had a burn on the instep of his right\r\n    foot, but perhaps well enough to wear a boot or shoe. He took\r\n    with him very excellent clothing, both summer and winter,\r\n    consisting of a brown suit in cloth, summer coats striped, check\r\n    cap, silk hat, &c. $50 reward will be paid if taken within\r\n    thirty miles of Alexandria or in the State of Virginia, and $150\r\n    and necessary expenses if taken out of the State and secured so\r\n    that I get him again. He is the property of Mrs. A.B. Fairfax,\r\n    of Alexandria, and is likely to make his way to Cincinnati,\r\n    where he has friends, named Hamilton and Hopes, now living.\r\n    ROBT. W. WHEAT.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam, answering to the above description, arrived safely in company\r\nwith Thomas Harper, about six days after the date of their departure\r\nfrom the house of bondage.\r\n\r\nMrs. A.B. Fairfax was the loser of this \"article.\" William spoke rather\r\nfavorably of her. He said he did not leave because he was treated badly,\r\nbut simply because he wanted to own himself--to be free. He also said\r\nthat he wanted to be able to take care of his family if he should see\r\nfit to marry.\r\n\r\nAs to Slavery, he could see no justice in the system; he therefore made\r\nup his mind no longer to yield submission thereto. Being a smart\r\n\"chattel,\" he reasoned well on the question of Slavery, and showed very\r\nconclusively that even under the kindest mistress it had no charms for\r\nhim--that at best, it was robbery and an outrage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Harper, his comrade, fled from John Cowling, who also lived near\r\nAlexandria. His great trouble was, that he had a wife and family, but\r\ncould do nothing for them. He thought that it was hard to see them in\r\nwant and abused when he was not at liberty to aid or protect them. He\r\ngrew very unhappy, but could see no remedy except in flight.\r\n\r\nCowling, his master, was an Englishman by birth, and followed\r\nblack-smithing for a living. He was a man in humble circumstances,\r\ntrying to increase his small fortune by slave-labor.\r\n\r\nHe allowed Thomas to hire himself for one hundred dollars a year, which\r\namount he was required to raise, sick or well. He did not complain,\r\nhowever, of having received any personal abuse from his blacksmith\r\nmaster. It was the system which was daily grinding the life out of him,\r\nthat caused him to suffer, and likewise escape. By trade Thomas was also\r\na blacksmith. He left a wife and three children.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARRY WISE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    $100 REWARD.--Ran away, on the 11th inst., negro man, Harry\r\n    Wise. He is about 24 years of age, and 5 feet 4 inches high;\r\n    muscular, with broad shoulders, and black or deep copper color;\r\n    roundish, smooth face, and rather lively expression. He came\r\n    from Harford county, and is acquainted about Belair market,\r\n    Baltimore. I will pay $50 reward for him, if taken in this or\r\n    Prince George's county, or $100 if arrested elsewhere.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    ELLIOTT BURWELL,\r\n\r\n    a29-eo3t*\r\n\r\n    West River, Anne Arundel county.\r\n\r\n\r\nHarry reached the station in Philadelphia, the latter part of August,\r\n1857. His excuse for leaving and seeking a habitation in Canada, was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"I was treated monstrous bad; my master was a very cross, crabbed man,\r\nand his wife was as cross as he was. The day I left they had to tie me\r\nto beat me, what about I could not tell; this is what made me leave. I\r\nescaped right out of his hands the day he had me; he was going with me\r\nto the barn to tie me across a hogshead, but I broke loose from him and\r\nran. He ran and got the gun to shoot me, but I soon got out of his\r\nreach, and I have not seen him since.\"\r\n\r\nHarry might never have found the Underground Rail Road, but for this\r\ndeadly onslaught upon him by his master. His mind was wrought up to a\r\nvery high state of earnestness, and he was deemed a very fitting subject\r\nfor Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM NORFOLK, VA.\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAM WOODERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough slave-holders had spared no pains to keep Abram in the dark and\r\nto make him love his yoke, he proved by his actions, that he had no\r\nfaith in their doctrines. Nor did he want for language in which to state\r\nthe reasons for his actions. He was just in the prime of life,\r\nthirty-five years of age, chestnut color, common size, with a scar over\r\nthe left eye, and another on the upper lip.\r\n\r\nLike many others, he talked in a simple, earnest manner, and in answer\r\nto queries as to how he had fared, the following is his statement:\r\n\r\n\"I was held as the property of the late Taylor Sewell, but when I\r\nescaped I was in the service of W.C. Williams, a commission merchant. My\r\nold master was a very severe man, but he was always very kind to me. He\r\nhad a great many more colored folks, was very severe amongst them, would\r\nget mad and sell right away. He was a drinking man, dissipated and a\r\ngambler, a real sportsman. He lived on Newell Creek, about twelve miles\r\nfrom Norfolk. For the last eight years I was hired to W.C. Williams, for\r\n$150 a year--if I had all that money, it might do me some good. I left\r\nbecause I wanted to enjoy myself some. I felt if I staid and got old no\r\none would care for me, I wouldn't be of no account to nobody.\"\r\n\r\n\"But are not the old slaves well cared for by their masters?\" a member\r\nof the Committee here remarked. \"Take care of them! no!\" Abram replied\r\nwith much earnestness, and then went on to explain how such property was\r\nleft to perish. Said Abram, \"There was an old man named Ike, who\r\nbelonged to the same estate that I did, he was treated like a dog; after\r\nthey could get no more work out of him, they said, 'let him die, he is\r\nof no service; there is no use of getting a doctor for him.' Accordingly\r\nthere could be no other fate for the old man but to suffer and die with\r\ncreepers in his legs.\"\r\n\r\nIt was sickening to hear him narrate instances of similar suffering in\r\nthe case of old slaves. Abram left two sisters and one brother in\r\nbondage.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM WASHINGTON, D.C.\r\n\r\nGEORGE JOHNSON, THOMAS AND ADAM SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    $300 REWARD.--Ran away from Kalorama, near Washington City,\r\n    D.C., on Saturday night, the 22d of August, 1857, negro man,\r\n    George Johnson, aged about 25 years. Height about six feet; of\r\n    dark copper color; bushy hair; erect in stature and polite in\r\n    his address.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    I will give the above reward if taken in a free State; $100 if\r\n    taken within the District of Columbia, or $200 if taken in\r\n    Maryland. In either case he must be secured so that I get him.\r\n\r\n    MISS ELEANOR J. CONWAY, Baltimore, Md.,\r\n\r\n    or OLIVER DUFOUR, Washington City, D.C.\r\n\r\n    sl-eod 2w.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Polite in his address\" as George was, he left his mistress, Eleanor J.\r\nConway, without bidding her good-bye, or asking for a pass. But he did\r\nnot leave his young mistress in this way without good reasons for so\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nIn his interview with the Committee about five days after his departure\r\nfrom his old home, he stated his grievances as follows: \"I was born the\r\nslave of a Mr. Conway, of Washington, D.C.\" Under this personage George\r\nadmitted that he had experienced slavery in rather a mild form until\r\ndeath took the old man off, which event occurred when George was quite\r\nyoung. He afterwards served the widow Conway until her death, and lastly\r\nhe fell into the hands of Miss Eleanor J. Conway, who resided in\r\nBaltimore, and derived her support from the labor of slaves whom she\r\nkept hired out as was George. Of the dead, George did not utter very\r\nhard things, but he spoke of his young mistress as having a \"very mean\r\nprinciple.\" Said George, \"She has sold one of my brothers and one of my\r\ncousins since last April, and she was very much opposed to freedom.\"\r\n\r\nJudging from the company that she kept she might before a great while\r\nchange her relations in life. George thought, however agreeable to her,\r\nit might not be to him. So he made up his mind that his chances for\r\nfreedom would not be likely to grow any better by remaining. In the\r\nneighborhood from which he fled he left his father, mother and two\r\nsisters, each having different owners. Two brothers had been sold South.\r\nWhether they ever heard what had become of the runaway George is not\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas, the companion of George, was of a truly remarkable structure;\r\nphysically and mentally he belonged to the highest order of the bond\r\nclass. His place of chains was in the city of Washington, and the name\r\nof the man for whom he had been compelled to do unrequited labor was\r\nWilliam Rowe, a bricklayer, and a \"pretty clever fellow,--always used me\r\nwell,\" said Thomas. \"Why did you leave then?\" asked a member of the\r\nCommittee. He replied, \"I made a proposition to my master to buy myself\r\nfor eight hundred dollars, but he refused, and wanted a thousand. Then I\r\nmade up my mind that I would make less do.\" Thomas had been hired out at\r\nthe National Hotel for thirty dollars a month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdam was well described in the following advertisement taken from the\r\n_Baltimore Sun_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    $300 REWARD.--Ran away from the subscriber, near Beltsville,\r\n    Prince George's county, Md., on Saturday night, the 22d of\r\n    August, 1857, Negro Man, Adam Smith, aged about 30. Height 5\r\n    feet 4 or 5 inches; black bushy hair, and well dressed. He has a\r\n    mother living at Mr. Hamilton's, on Capitol Hill, Washington,\r\n    D.C.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    I will give the above reward if taken in a free State; $50 if\r\n    taken in the District of Columbia or counties of Montgomery and\r\n    Prince George's, or $100 if taken elsewhere and secured so that\r\n    I get him.\r\n\r\n    ISAAC SCAGGS.\r\n\r\n    a27-6t*\r\n\r\n\r\nWith his fellow-passengers, George and Thomas, he greatly enjoyed the\r\nhospitalities of the Underground Rail Road in the city of Brotherly\r\nLove, and had a very high idea of Canada, as he anticipated becoming a\r\nBritish subject at an early day. The story which Adam related concerning\r\nhis master and his reasons for escaping ran thus:\r\n\r\n\"My master was a very easy man, but would work you hard and never allow\r\nyou any chance night or day; he was a farmer, about fifty, stout, full\r\nface, a real country ruffian; member of no church, a great drinker and\r\ngambler; will sell a slave as quick as any other slave-holder. He had a\r\ngreat deal of cash, but did not rank high in society. His wife was very\r\nsevere; hated a colored man to have any comfort in the world. They had\r\neight adult and nine young slaves.\"\r\n\r\nAdam left because he \"didn't like the treatment.\" Twice he had been\r\nplaced on the auction-block. He was a married man and left a wife and\r\none child.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUR ABLE-BODIED \"ARTICLES\" IN ONE ARRIVAL, 1857.\r\n\r\nEDWARD, AND JOSEPH HAINES, THOMAS HARRIS, AND JAMES SHELDON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This certainly is a likely-looking party,\" are the first words which\r\ngreet the eye, on turning to the record, under which their brief\r\nnarratives were entered at the Philadelphia station, September 7th,\r\n1857.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward was about forty-four years of age, of unmixed blood, and in point\r\nof natural ability he would rank among the most intelligent of the\r\noppressed class. Without owing thanks to any body he could read and\r\nwrite pretty well, having learned by his own exertions.\r\n\r\nTabby and Eliza Fortlock, sisters, and single women, had been deriving\r\nyears of leisure, comfort, and money from the sweat of Edward's brow.\r\nThe maiden ladies owned about eighteen head of this kind of property,\r\nfar more than they understood how to treat justly or civilly. They bore\r\nthe name of being very hard to satisfy. They were proverbially \"stingy.\"\r\nThey were members of the Christ Episcopal Church.\r\n\r\nEdward, however, remembered very sensibly that his own brother had been\r\nsold South by these ladies; and not only he, but others also, had been\r\nsent to the auction-block, and there made merchandise of. Edward,\r\ntherefore, had no faith in these lambs of the flock, and left them\r\nbecause he thought there was reason in all things. \"Yearly my task had\r\nbeen increased and made heavier and heavier, until I was pressed beyond\r\nwhat I could bear.\" Under this pressure no hope, present, or future,\r\ncould be discerned, except by escaping on the Underground Rail Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph was also one of the chattels belonging to the Misses Portlock. A\r\nmore active and wide-awake young man of twenty years of age, could not\r\neasily be found among the enslaved; he seemed to comprehend Slavery in\r\nall its bearings. From a small boy he had been hired out, making money\r\nfor the \"pious ladies\" who owned him. His experience under these\r\nprotectors had been similar to that of Edward given above. Joseph was of\r\na light brown color, (some of his friends may be able to decide by this\r\nsimple fact whether he is a relative, etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTom, a full-faced, good-natured-looking young man, was also of this\r\nparty. He was about twenty-seven years of age, and was said to be the\r\nslave of John Hatten, Esq., Cashier of the Virginia Bank of Portsmouth.\r\nTom admitted that he was treated very well by Mr. Hatten and his family,\r\nexcept that he was not allowed his freedom; besides he felt a little\r\ntired of having to pay twelve dollars a month for his hire, as he hired\r\nhis time of his master. Of course he was not insensible to the fact also\r\nthat he was liable to be sold any day.\r\n\r\nIn pondering over these slight drawbacks, Tom concluded that Slavery was\r\nno place for a man who valued his freedom, it mattered not how kind\r\nmasters or mistresses might be. Under these considerations he made up\r\nhis mind that he would have to let the cashier look out for himself, and\r\nhe would do the same. In this state of mind he joined the party for\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames was another associate passenger, and the best-looking \"article\" in\r\nthe party; few slaves showed a greater degree of intelligence and\r\nshrewdness. He had acquired the art of reading and writing very well,\r\nand was also a very ready talker. He was owned by Mrs. Maria Hansford of\r\nNew York. When he was quite small he remembered seeing his mistress, but\r\nnot since. He was raised with her sister, who resided in Norfolk, the\r\nplace of James' servitude.\r\n\r\nJames confessed that he had been treated very kindly, and had been\r\ntaught to read by members of the family. This was an exceptional case,\r\nworthy of especial note.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all the kindness that James had received, he hated\r\nSlavery, and took a deep interest in the Underground Rail Road, and used\r\nhis intelligence and shrewdness to good purpose in acting as an\r\nUnderground Rail Road agent for a time. James was a young man, about\r\ntwenty-five years of age, well made, and of a yellow complexion.\r\n\r\nAlthough none of this party experienced brutal treatment personally,\r\nthey had seen the \"elephant\" quite to their satisfaction in Norfolk and\r\nvicinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM ARLINGTON, MD. 1857.\r\n\r\nJOHN ALEXANDER BUTLER, WILLIAM HENRY HIPKINS, JOHN HENRY MOORE AND\r\nGEORGE HILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis party made, at first sight, a favorable impression; they\r\nrepresented the bone and sinew of the slave class of Arlington, and upon\r\ninvestigation the Committee felt assured that they would carry with them\r\nto Canada industry and determination such as would tell well for the\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Alexander Butler was about twenty-nine years of age, well made,\r\ndark color, and intelligent. He assured the Committee that he had been\r\nhampered by Slavery from his birth, and that in consequence thereof he\r\nhad suffered serious hardships. He said that a man by the name of Wm.\r\nFord, belonging to the Methodist Church at Arlington, had defrauded him\r\nof his just rights, and had compelled him to work on his farm for\r\nnothing; also had deprived him of an education, and had kept him in\r\npoverty and ignorance all his life.\r\n\r\nIn going over the manner in which he had been treated, he added that not\r\nonly was his master a hard man, but that his wife and children partook\r\nof the same evil spirit; \"they were all hard.\" True, they had but three\r\nslaves to oppress, but these they spared not.\r\n\r\nJohn was a married man, and spoke affectionately of his wife and\r\nchildren, whom he had to leave behind at Cross-Roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry, who was heart and soul in earnest with regard to reaching\r\nCanada, and was one of this party, was twenty-three years of age, and\r\nwas a stout, yellow man with a remarkably large head, and looked as if\r\nhe was capable of enjoying Canada and caring for himself.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the fettered condition from which he had escaped, the\r\nname of Ephraim Swart, \"a gambler and spree'r\" was mentioned as the\r\nindividual who had wronged him of his liberty most grievously.\r\n\r\nAgainst Swart he expressed himself with much manly feeling, and judging\r\nfrom his manner he appeared to be a dangerous customer for master Swart\r\nto encounter north of Mason and Dixon's line.\r\n\r\nWilliam complained that Swart \"would come home late at night drunk, and\r\nif he did not find us awake he would not attempt to wake us, but would\r\nbegin cutting and slashing with a cowhide. He treated his wife very bad\r\ntoo; sometimes when she would stand up for the servants he would knock\r\nher down. Many times at midnight she would have to leave the house and\r\ngo to her mother's for safety; she was a very nice woman, but he was the\r\nvery old Satan himself.\"\r\n\r\nWhile William Henry was debarred from learning letters under his brutal\r\noverseer, he nevertheless learned how to plan ways and means by which to\r\nescape his bondage. He left his old mother and two brothers wholly\r\nignorant of his movements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Henry Moore, another one of the Arlington party, was about\r\ntwenty-four years of age, a dark, spare-built man. He named David\r\nMitchell, of Havre-de-Grace, as the individual above all others who had\r\nkept his foot on his neck. Without undertaking to give John Henry's\r\ndescription of Mitchell in full, suffice it to give the following facts:\r\n\"Mitchell would go off and get drunk, and come home, and if the slaves\r\nhad not as much work done as he had tasked them with, he would go to\r\nbeating them with clubs or anything he could get in his hand. He was a\r\ntall, spare-built man, with sandy hair. He had a wife and family, but\r\nhis wife was no better than he was.\" When charges or statements were\r\nmade by fugitives against those from whom they escaped, particular pains\r\nwere taken to find out if such statements could be verified; if the\r\nexplanation appeared valid, the facts as given were entered on the\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nJohn Henry could not read, but greatly desired to learn, and he looked\r\nas though he had a good head for so doing. Before he left there had been\r\nsome talk of selling him South. This rumor had a marked effect upon John\r\nHenry's nervous system; it also expanded his idea touching traveling,\r\nthe Underground Rail Road, etc. As he had brothers and sisters who had\r\nbeen sold to Georgia he made up his mind that his master was not to be\r\ntrusted for a single day; he was therefore one of the most\r\nwilling-hearted passengers in the party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Hill, also a fellow-passenger, was about twenty-four years of\r\nage, quite black, medium size, and of fair, natural mother wit. In\r\nlooking back upon his days of bondage, his mind reverted to Dr.\r\nSavington, of Harford county, as the person who owed him for years of\r\nhard and unrequited toil, and at the same time was his so-called owner.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, it seemed, had failed to treat George well, for he declared\r\nthat he had never received enough to eat the whole time that he was with\r\nhim. \"The clothes I have on I got by overwork of nights. When I started\r\nI hadn't a shoe on my foot, these were given to me. He was an old man,\r\nbut a very wicked man, and drank very hard.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge had been taught field work pretty thoroughly, but nothing in the\r\nway of reading and writing.\r\n\r\nGeorge explained why he left as follows: \"I left because I had got along\r\nwith him as well as I could. Last Saturday a week he was in a great rage\r\nand drunk. He shot at me. He never went away but what he would come home\r\ndrunk, and if any body made him angry out from home, he would come home\r\nand take his spite out of his people.\"\r\n\r\nHe owned three grown men, two women and six children. Thus hating\r\nSlavery heartily, George was enthusiastically in favor of Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE PASSENGERS, 1857.\r\n\r\nELIZA JANE JOHNSON, HARRIET STEWART, AND HER DAUGHTER MARY ELIZA,\r\nWILLIAM COLE, AND HANSON HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEliza Jane was a tall, dark, young woman, about twenty-three years of\r\nage, and had been held to service by a widow woman, named Sally Spiser,\r\nwho was \"anything but a good woman.\" The place of her habitation was in\r\nDelaware, between Concord and Georgetown.\r\n\r\nEliza Jane's excuse for leaving was this: She charged her mistress with\r\ntrying to work her to death, and with unkind treatment generally. When\r\ntimes became so hard that she could not stand her old mistress \"Sally\"\r\nany longer, she \"took out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHarriet did not come in company with Eliza Jane, but by accident they\r\nmet at the station in Philadelphia. Harriet and daughter came from\r\nWashington, D.C.\r\n\r\nHarriet had treasured up a heavy account against a white man known by\r\nthe name of William A. Linton, whom she described as a large, red-faced\r\nman, who had in former years largely invested in slave property, but\r\nlatterly he had been in the habit of selling off, until only seven\r\nremained, and among them she and her child were numbered; therefore, she\r\nregarded him as one who had robbed her of her rights, and daily\r\nthreatened her with sale.\r\n\r\nHarriet was a very likely-looking woman, twenty-nine years of age,\r\nmedium size, and of a brown color, and far from being a stupid person.\r\nHer daughter also was a smart, and interesting little girl of eight\r\nyears of age, and seemed much pleased to be getting out of the reach of\r\nslave-holders. The mother and daughter, however, had not won their\r\nfreedom thus far, without great suffering, from the long and fatiguing\r\ndistance which they were obliged to walk. Sometimes the hardness of the\r\nroad made them feel as though they would be compelled to give up the\r\njourney, whether or not; but they added to their faith, patience, and\r\nthus finally succeeded.\r\n\r\nHeavy rewards were offered through advertisements in the Baltimore Sun,\r\nbut they availed naught. The Vigilance Committee received them safely,\r\nfully cared for them, and safely sent them through to the land of\r\nrefuge. Harriet's daring undertaking obliged her to leave her husband,\r\nJohn Stewart, behind; also one sister, a slave in Georgetown. One\r\nbrother had been sold South. Her mother she had laid away in a slave's\r\ngrave: but her father she hoped to find in Canada, he having escaped\r\nthither when she was a small girl; at least it was supposed that he had\r\ngone there.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM HOWARD CO., MD., 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\nBILL COLE AND HANSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    $500 REWARD.--Ran away on Saturday night, September 5th, Bill\r\n    Cole, aged about 37 years, of copper complexion, stout built,\r\n    ordinary height, walks very erect, earnest but squint look when\r\n    spoken to.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    Also, Hanson, copper complexion, well made, sickly look, medium\r\n    height, stoops when walking, quick when spoken to; aged about 30\r\n    years.\r\n\r\n    Three hundred dollars will be paid for the apprehension and\r\n    delivery of Bill, if caught out of the State, and two hundred if\r\n    in the State. Two hundred dollars for Hanson if out of the\r\n    State, and one hundred dollars if in the State.\r\n\r\n    W. BAKER DORSEY,\r\n\r\n    HAMMOND DORSEY,\r\n\r\n    Savage P.O., Howard county, Md.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch notoriety as was given them by the above advertisement, did not in\r\nthe least damage Bill and Hanson in the estimation of the Committee. It\r\nwas rather pleasing to know that they were of so much account as to call\r\nforth such a public expression from the Messrs. Dorsey. Besides it saved\r\nthe Committee the necessity of writing out a description of them, the\r\nonly fault found with the advertisement being in Reference to their\r\nages. Bill, for instance, was put down ten years younger than he claimed\r\nto be. Which was correct, Bill or his master? The Committee were\r\ninclined to believe Bill in preference to his master, for the simple\r\nreason that he seemed to account satisfactorily for his master's making\r\nhim so young: he (the master) could sell him for much more at\r\nthirty-seven than at forty-seven. Unscrupulous horse-jockies and traders\r\nin their fellow-men were about on a par as to that kind of sharp\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nHanson, instead of being only thirty, declared that he was thirty-seven\r\nthe fifteenth of February. These errors are noticed and corrected\r\nbecause it is barely possible that Bill and Hanson may still be lost to\r\ntheir relatives, who may be inquiring and hunting in every direction for\r\nthem, and as many others may turn to these records with hope, it is,\r\ntherefore, doubly important that these descriptions shall be as far as\r\npossible, correct, especially as regards ages.\r\n\r\nHanson laughed heartily over the idea that he looked \"sickly.\" While on\r\nthe Underground Rail Road, he looked very far from sickly; on the\r\ncontrary, a more healthy, fat, and stout-looking piece of property no\r\none need wish to behold, than was this same Hanson. He confessed,\r\nhowever, that for some time previous to his departure, he had feigned\r\nsickness,--told his master that he was \"sick all over.\" \"Ten times a day\r\nHanson said they would ask him how he was, but was not willing to make\r\nhis task much lighter.\" The following description was given of his\r\nmaster, and his reason for leaving him:\r\n\r\n\"My master was a red-faced farmer, severe temper, would curse, and\r\nswear, and drink, and sell his slaves whenever he felt like it. My\r\nmistress was a pretty cross, curious kind of a woman too, though she was\r\na member of the Protestant Church. They were rich, and had big farms and\r\na good many slaves. They didn't allow me any provisions hardly; I had a\r\nwife, but they did not allow me to go see her, only once in a great\r\nwhile.\"\r\n\r\nBill providentially escaped from a well-known cripple, whom he undertook\r\nto describe as a \"very sneaking-looking man, medium size, smooth face; a\r\nwealthy farmer, who owned eighteen or twenty head of slaves, and was\r\nJudge of the Orphans' Court.\" \"He sells slaves occasionally.\" \"My\r\nmistress was a very large, rough, Irish-looking woman, with a very bad\r\ndisposition; it appeared like as if she hated to see a 'nigger,' and she\r\nwas always wanting her husband to have some one whipped, and she was a\r\nmember of the Methodist Church. My master was a trustee in the Episcopal\r\nChurch.\"\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the tribulation Bill had experienced under his\r\nChristian master and mistress, he had been led to disbelieve in the\r\nProtestant faith altogether, and declared that he felt persuaded that it\r\nwas all a \"pretense,\" and added that he \"never went to Church; no place\r\nwas provided in church for 'niggers' except a little pen for the\r\ncoachmen and waiters.\"\r\n\r\nBill had been honored with the post of \"head man on the place,\" but of\r\nthis office he was not proud.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY, MD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"JIM BELLE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    $100 REWARD.--Ran away from the subscriber on Saturday night,\r\n    Negro Man JIM BELLE. Jim is about five feet ten inches high,\r\n    black color, about 26 years of age has a down look; speaks slow\r\n    when spoken to; he has large, thick lips, and a mustache. He was\r\n    formerly owned by Edward Stansbury, late of Baltimore county,\r\n    and purchased by Edward Worthington, near Reisterstown, in\r\n    Baltimore county, at the late Stansbury's sale, who sold him to\r\n    B.M. and W.L. Campbell, of Baltimore city, of whom I purchased\r\n    Jim on the 13th of June last. His wife lives with her mother,\r\n    Ann Robertson, in Corn Alley, between Lee and Hill streets,\r\n    Baltimore city, where he has other relations, and where he is\r\n    making his way. I will give the above reward, no matter where\r\n    taken, so he is brought home or secured in jail so I get him\r\n    again.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    ZACHARIAH BERRY, of W.,\r\n\r\n    near Upper Marlboro', Prince George's county, Md.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Zachariah Berry, who manifested so much interest in Jim, may be\r\nuntil this hour in ignorance of the cause of his running off without\r\nasking leave, etc. Jim stated, that he was once sold and flogged\r\nunmercifully simply for calling his master \"Mr.,\" instead of master, and\r\nhe alleged that this was the secret of his eyes being opened and his\r\nmind nerved to take advantage of the Underground Rail Road.\r\n\r\nWhile it may not now do Zachariah Berry much good to learn this secret,\r\nit may, nevertheless, be of some interest to those who were of near kin\r\nto Jim to glean even so small a ray of light.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM RAPPAHANNOCK COUNTY, 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\nPASCAL QUANTENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPascal fled from Virginia, and accused Bannon and Brady of doing\r\nviolence to his liberty. He had, however, been in their clutches only a\r\nshort while before escaping, but that short while seemed almost an age,\r\nas he was treated so meanly by them compared with the treatment which he\r\nhad experienced under his former master.\r\n\r\nAccording to Pascal's story, which was evidently true, his previous\r\nmaster was his own father (John Quantence), who had always acknowledged\r\nPascal as his child, whom he did not scruple to tell people he should\r\nset free; that he did not intend that he should serve anybody else. But,\r\nwhile out riding one day, he was thrown from his horse and instantly\r\nkilled. Naturally enough, no will being found, his effects were all\r\nadministered upon and Pascal was sold with the farm. Bannon and Brady\r\nwere the purchasers, at least of Pascal. In their power, immediately the\r\ntime of trouble began with Pascal, and so continued until he could no\r\nlonger endure it. \"Hoggishness,\" according to Pascal's phraseology, was\r\nthe most predominant trait in the character of his new masters. In his\r\nmournful situation and grief he looked toward Canada and started with\r\ncourage and hope, and thus succeeded. Such deliverances always afforded\r\nvery great joy to the Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM NORTH CAROLINA, 1857.\r\n\r\nHARRY GRIMES, GEORGE UPSHER, AND EDWARD LEWIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEET SLIT FOR RUNNING AWAY, FLOGGED, STABBED, STAYED IN THE HOLLOW OF A\r\nBIG POPLAR TREE, VISITED BY A SNAKE, ABODE IN A CAVE. The coming of the\r\npassengers here noticed was announced in the subjoined letter from\r\nThomas Garrett:\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILMINGTON, 11th Mo. 25th, 1857.\r\n\r\n    RESPECTED FRIEND, WILLIAM STILL:--I write to inform thee, that\r\n    Captain Fountain has arrived this evening from the South with\r\n    three men, one of which is nearly naked, and very lousy. He has\r\n    been in the swamps of Carolina for eighteen months past. One of\r\n    the others has been some time out. I would send them on\r\n    to-night, but will have to provide two of them with some clothes\r\n    before they can be sent by rail road. I have forgotten the\r\n    number of thy house. As most likely all are more or less lousy,\r\n    having been compelled to sleep together, I thought best to write\r\n    thee so that thee may get a suitable place to take them to, and\r\n    meet them at Broad and Prime streets on the arrival of the cars,\r\n    about 11 o'clock to-morrow evening. I have engaged one of our\r\n    men to take them to his house, and go to Philadelphia with them\r\n    to-morrow evening. Johnson who will accompany them is a man in\r\n    whom we can confide. Please send me the number of thy house when\r\n    thee writes.\r\n\r\n    THOMAS GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis epistle from the old friend of the fugitive, Thomas Garrett,\r\nexcited unusual interest. Preparation was immediately made to give the\r\nfugitives a kind reception, and at the same time to destroy their\r\nplagues, root and branch, without mercy.\r\n\r\nThey arrived according to appointment. The cleansing process was carried\r\ninto effect most thoroughly, and no vermin were left to tell the tale of\r\nsuffering they had caused. Straightway the passengers were made\r\ncomfortable in every way, and the spirit of freedom seemed to be burning\r\nlike \"fire shut up in the bones.\" The appearance alone of these men\r\nindicated their manhood, and wonderful natural ability. The examining\r\nCommittee were very desirous of hearing their story without a moment's\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Harry, from having suffered most, was the hero of this party, and\r\nwithal was an intelligent man, he was first called upon to make his\r\nstatement as to how times had been with him in the prison house, from\r\nhis youth up. He was about forty-six years of age, according to his\r\nreckoning, full six feet high, and in muscular appearance was very\r\nrugged, and in his countenance were evident marks of firmness. He said\r\nthat he was born a slave in North Carolina, and had been sold three\r\ntimes. He was first sold when a child three years of age, the second\r\ntime when he was thirteen years old, and the third and last time he was\r\nsold to Jesse Moore, from whom he fled. Prior to his coming into the\r\nhands of Moore he had not experienced any very hard usage, at least\r\nnothing more severe than fell to the common lot of slave-boys, therefore\r\nthe period of his early youth was deemed of too little interest to\r\nrecord in detail. In fact time only could be afforded for noticing very\r\nbriefly some of the more remarkable events of his bondage. The examining\r\nCommittee confined their interrogations to his last taskmaster.\r\n\r\n\"How did Moore come by you?\" was one of the inquiries. \"He bought me,\"\r\nsaid Harry, \"of a man by the name of Taylor, nine or ten years ago; he\r\nwas as bad as he could be, couldn't be any worse to be alive. He was\r\nabout fifty years of age, when I left him, a right red-looking man, big\r\nbellied old fellow, weighs about two hundred and forty pounds. He drinks\r\nhard, he is just like a rattlesnake, just as cross and crabbed when he\r\nspeaks, seems like he could go through you. He flogged Richmond for not\r\nploughing the corn good, that was what he pretended to whip him for.\r\nRichmond ran away, was away four months, as nigh as I can guess, then\r\nthey cotched him, then struck him a hundred lashes, and then they split\r\nboth feet to the bone, and split both his insteps, and then master took\r\nhis knife and stuck it into him in many places; after he done him that\r\nway, he put him into the barn to shucking corn. For a long time he was\r\nnot able to work; when he did partly recover, he was set to work again.\"\r\n\r\nWe ceased to record anything further concerning Richmond, although not a\r\nfourth part of what Harry narrated was put upon paper. The account was\r\ntoo sickening and the desire to hear Harry's account of himself too\r\ngreat to admit of further delay; so Harry confined himself to the\r\nsufferings and adventures which had marked his own life. Briefly he gave\r\nthe following facts: \"I have been treated bad. One day we were grubbing\r\nand master said we didn't do work enough. 'How came there was no more\r\nwork done that day?' said master to me. I told him I did work. In a more\r\nstormy manner he 'peated the question. I then spoke up and said: 'Massa,\r\nI don't know what to say.' At once massa plunged his knife into my neck\r\ncausing me to stagger. Massa was drunk. He then drove me down to the\r\nblack folk's houses (cabins of the slaves). He then got his gun, called\r\nthe overseer, and told him to get some ropes. While he was gone I said,\r\n'Massa, now you are going to tie me up and cut me all to pieces for\r\nnothing. I would just as leave you would take your gun and shoot me down\r\nas to tie me up and cut me all to pieces for nothing.' In a great rage\r\nhe said 'go.' I jumped, and he put up his gun and snapped both barrels\r\nat me. He then set his dogs on me, but as I had been in the habit of\r\nmaking much of them, feeding them, &c. they would not follow me, and I\r\nkept on straight to the woods. My master and the overseer cotched the\r\nhorses and tried to run me down, but as the dogs would not follow me\r\nthey couldn't make nothing of it. It was the last of August a year ago.\r\nThe devil was into him, and he flogged and beat four of the slaves, one\r\nman and three of the women, and said if he could only get hold of me he\r\nwouldn't strike me, 'nary-a-lick,' but would tie me to a tree and empty\r\nboth barrels into me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nIn the woods I lived on nothing, you may say, and something too. I had\r\nbread, and roasting ears, and 'taters. I stayed in the hollow of a big\r\npoplar tree for seven months; the other part of the time I stayed in a\r\ncave. I suffered mighty bad with the cold and for something to eat. Once\r\nI got me some charcoal and made me a fire in my tree to warm me, and it\r\nliked to killed me, so I had to take the fire out. One time a snake come\r\nto the tree, poked its head in the hollow and was coming in, and I took\r\nmy axe and chopped him in two. It was a poplar leaf moccasin, the\r\npoisonest kind of a snake we have. While in the woods all my thoughts\r\nwas how to get away to a free country.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nSubsequently, in going back over his past history, he referred to the\r\nfact, that on an occasion long before the cave and tree existence,\r\nalready noticed, when suffering under this brutal master, he sought\r\nprotection in the woods and abode twenty-seven months in a cave, before\r\nhe surrendered himself, or was captured. His offence, in this instance,\r\nwas simply because he desired to see his wife, and \"stole\" away from his\r\nmaster's plantation and went a distance of five miles, to where she\r\nlived, to see her. For this grave crime his master threatened to give\r\nhim a hundred lashes, and to shoot him; in order to avoid this\r\npunishment, he escaped to the woods, etc. The lapse of a dozen years and\r\nrecent struggles for an existence, made him think lightly of his former\r\ntroubles and he would, doubtless, have failed to recall his earlier\r\nconflicts but for the desire manifested by the Committee to get all the\r\ninformation out of him they could.\r\n\r\nHe was next asked, \"Had you a wife and family?\" \"Yes, sir,\". he\r\nanswered, \"I had a wife and eight children, belonged to the widow\r\nSlade.\" Harry gave the names of his wife and children as follows: Wife,\r\nSusan, and children, Oliver, Sabey, Washington, Daniel, Jonas, Harriet,\r\nMoses and Rosetta, the last named he had never seen. \"Between my\r\nmistress and my master there was not much difference.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nOf his comrades time admitted of writing out only very brief sketches,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD LEWIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    $100 REWARD.--Ran away from the subscriber, on the 7th of\r\n    November, negro slave, EDGAR. He is 36 years old, 6 feet high,\r\n    of dark brown complexion, very high forehead, is a little bald,\r\n    and is inclined to stoop in the shoulders. Edgar says he was\r\n    raised in Norfolk county, has worked about Norfolk several\r\n    years. I bought him at the Auction house of Messrs. Pulham &\r\n    Davis, the 20th of July, 1856. The bill of sale was signed by\r\n    W.Y. Milmer for Jas. A. Bilisoly, administrator of G.W.\r\n    Chambers, dec'd. He told one of my negroes he was going to\r\n    Norfolk to sell some plunder he had there, then go to Richmond,\r\n    steal his wife, get on board a boat about Norfolk, and go to a\r\n    free State. He can read and write well, and I have no doubt he\r\n    has provided himself with papers of some kind. He may have\r\n    purchased the papers of some free negro. I will give the above\r\n    reward of One Hundred Dollars to any person who will arrest and\r\n    confine him, so I can get him.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    C.H. GAY.\r\n\r\n    My Post office is Laurel, N.C. no. 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above advertisement, which was cut from a Southern paper, brought\r\nlight in regard to one of the passengers at least. It was not often that\r\na slave was so fortunate as to get such a long sketch of himself in a\r\nnewspaper. The description is so highly complimentary, that we simply\r\nendorse it as it stands. The sketch as taken for the record book is here\r\ntranscribed as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Edward reported himself from Franklin county, N.C., where, according to\r\nstatement, a common farmer by the name of Carter Gay owned him, under\r\nwhose oppression his life was rendered most unhappy, who stinted him\r\ndaily for food and barely allowed him clothing enough to cover his\r\nnakedness, who neither showed justice nor mercy to any under his\r\ncontrol, the 'weaker vessels' not excepted; therefore Edward was\r\nconvinced that it was in vain to hope for comfort under such a master.\r\nMoreover, his appetite for liquor, combined with a high temper, rendered\r\nhim a being hard to please, but easy to excite to a terrible degree.\r\nScarcely had Edward lived two years with this man (Gay) when he felt\r\nthat he had lived with him long enough. Two years previous to his coming\r\ninto the hands of Gay, he and his wife were both sold; the wife one day\r\nand he the next. She brought eleven hundred and twenty-five dollars, and\r\nhe eight hundred and thirty-five dollars; thus they were sold and resold\r\nas a matter of speculation, and husband and wife were parted.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the fugitives had been well cared for by the Committee, they were\r\nforwarded on North; but for some reason they were led to stop short of\r\nCanada, readily finding employment and going to work to take care of\r\nthemselves. How they were received and in what way they were situated,\r\nthe subjoined letter from Edward will explain:\r\n\r\n\r\n    SKANEATELES, Dec. 17, 1857.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:--As I promised to let you hear from me as soon as I\r\n    found a home, I will now fulfill my promise to you and say that\r\n    I am alive and well and have found a stopping place for the\r\n    winter.\r\n\r\n    When we arrived at Syracuse we found Mr. Loguen ready to receive\r\n    us, and as times are rather hard in Canada he thought best for\r\n    us not to go there, so he sent us about twenty miles west of\r\n    Syracuse to Skaneateles, where George Upshur and myself soon\r\n    found work. Henry Grimes is at work in Garden about eight miles\r\n    from this place.\r\n\r\n    If you should chance to hear any of my friends inquiring for me,\r\n    please direct them to Skaneateles, Onondaga county, N.Y.\r\n\r\n    If you can inform me of the whereabouts of Miss Alice Jones I\r\n    shall be very much obliged to you, until I can pay you better. I\r\n    forgot to ask you about her when I was at your house. She\r\n    escaped about two years ago.\r\n\r\n    Please not to forget to inquire of my wife, Rachel Land, and if\r\n    you should hear of her, let me know immediately, George Upshur\r\n    and myself send our best respects to you and your family.\r\n    Remember us to Mrs. Jackson and Miss Julia. I hope to meet you\r\n    all again, if not on earth may we so live that we shall meet in\r\n    that happy land where tears and partings are not known.\r\n\r\n    Let me hear from you soon. This from your friend and well\r\n    wisher,\r\n\r\n    EDWARD LEWIS,\r\n\r\n    formerly, but now WILLIAM BRADY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE UPSHER.--The third in this arrival was also a full man. Slavery\r\nhad robbed him shamefully it is true; nevertheless he was a man of\r\nsuperior natural parts, physically and intellectually. Despite the\r\nefforts of slave-holders to keep him in the dark, he could read and\r\nwrite a little. His escape in the manner that he did, implied a direct\r\nprotest against the conduct of Dr. Thomas W. Upsher, of Richmond, Va.,\r\nwhom, he alleged, deprived him of his hire, and threatened him with\r\nimmediate sale. He had lived in North Carolina with the doctor about two\r\nyears. As a slave, his general treatment had been favorable, except for\r\na few months prior to his flight, which change on the part of his master\r\nled him to fear that a day of sale was nigh at hand. In fact the seventh\r\nof July had been agreed upon when he was to be in Richmond, to take his\r\nplace with others in the market on sale day; his hasty and resolute move\r\nfor freedom originated from this circumstance. He was well-known in\r\nNorfolk, and had served almost all his days in that city. These\r\npassengers averaged about six feet, and were of uncommonly\r\nwell-developed physical structure.\r\n\r\nThe pleasure of aiding such men from the horrors of Carolina Slavery was\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALFRED HOLLON, GEORGE AND CHARLES N. RODGERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe loss of this party likewise falls on Maryland. With all the efforts\r\nexerted by slave-holders, they could not prevent the Underground Rail\r\nRoad from bringing away passengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlfred was twenty-eight years of age, with sharp features, dark color,\r\nand of medium size. He charged one Elijah J. Johnson, a commissioner of\r\nBaltimore Co., with having deprived him of the fruits of his labor. He\r\nhad looked fully into his master's treatment of him, and had come to the\r\nconclusion that it was wrong in every respect, for one man to make\r\nanother work and then take all his wages from him; thus decided, Alfred,\r\ndesiring liberty, whereby he could do better for himself felt that he\r\nmust \"took out\" and make his way to Canada. Nevertheless, he admitted\r\nthat he had been \"treated pretty well\" compared with others. True, he\r\nhad \"not been fed very well;\" Elijah, his master, was an old man with a\r\nwhite head, tall and stout, and the owner of fifteen head of slaves. At\r\nthe same time, a member of St. John's church.\r\n\r\nAlfred had treasured up the sad remembrance against him of the sale of\r\nhis mother from him when a little boy, only three years old. While he\r\nwas then too young to have retained her features in his memory, the fact\r\nhad always been a painful one to reflect upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge was twenty-six years of age, stout, long-faced, and of dark\r\ncomplexion. He looked as though he might have eagerly grasped education\r\nif the opportunity had been allowed him. He too belonged to Elijah J.\r\nJohnson, against whom he entertained much more serious objections than\r\nAlfred. Indeed, George did not hesitate to say with emphasis, that he\r\nneither liked his old master, mistress, nor any of the family. Without\r\nrecording his grievances in detail, a single instance will suffice of\r\nthe kind of treatment to which he objected, and which afforded the\r\npretext for his becoming a patron of the Underground Rail Road.\r\n\r\nIt was this, said George: \"I went into the corn-field and got some corn.\r\nThis made my master and mistress very mad, and about it Dr. Franklin\r\nRodgers, my young mistress' husband, struck me some pretty heavy blows,\r\nand knocked me with his fist, etc.\" Thus, George's blood was raised, and\r\nhe at once felt that it was high time to be getting away from such\r\npatriarchs. It was only necessary to form a strong resolution and to\r\nstart without delay.\r\n\r\nThere were two others who, he believed, could be trusted, so he made\r\nknown his intentions to them, and finding them sound on the question of\r\nfreedom he was glad of their company. For an emergency, he provided\r\nhimself with a pair of pistols and a formidable-looking knife, and\r\nstarted, bent on reaching Canada; determined at least, not to be taken\r\nback to bondage alive. Charles was twenty-four years of age, a very\r\ndark-colored individual, and also belonged to said Johnson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles was well acquainted with his old master and mistress, and made\r\nvery quick work of giving his experience. After hearing him, from the\r\nmanner in which he expressed himself, no one could doubt his earnestness\r\nand veracity. His testimony ran substantially thus:\r\n\r\n\"For the last three years I have been treated very hard. In the presence\r\nof the servants, old Johnson had me tied, stripped, and with his own\r\nhands, flogged me on the naked back shamefully. The old mistress was\r\ncross too.\" It was some time before the smarting ceased, but it was not\r\nlong ere the suffering produced very decided aspirations to get over to\r\nJohn Bull's Dominions. He resolved to go, at all hazards. In order that\r\nhe might not be surprised on the Underground Rail Road without any\r\nweapons of defense, determined as he was to fight rather than be dragged\r\nback, he provided himself with a heavy, leaden ball and a razor. They\r\nmet, however, with no serious difficulty, save from hard walking and\r\nextreme hunger. In appearance, courage, and mother-wit, this party was\r\nof much promise.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM KENT COUNTY, 1857.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL BENTON, JOHN ALEXANDER, JAMES HENRY, AND SAMUEL TURNER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese passengers journeyed together from the land of whips and chains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSam Benton was about twenty-six years of age, medium size, pretty dark\r\ncolor, and possessed a fair share of intelligence. He understood very\r\nwell how sadly Slavery had wronged him by keeping him in ignorance and\r\npoverty.\r\n\r\nHe stated as the cause of his flight that William Campbell had oppressed\r\nhim and kept him closely at hard labor without paying him, and at the\r\nsame time \"did not give him half enough to eat, and no clothing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Alexander was about forty-four years of age, a man of ordinary\r\nsize, quite black, and a good specimen of a regular corn-field hand.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you leave, John?\" said a member of the Committee. He coolly\r\nreplied that \"Handy (his master was named George Handy) got hold of me\r\ntwice, and I promised my Lord that he should never get hold of me\r\nanother time.\"\r\n\r\nOf course it was the severity of these two visitations that made John a\r\nthinker and an actor at the same time. The evil practices of the master\r\nproduced the fruits of liberty in John's breast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Henry, the third passenger, was about thirty-two years of age, and\r\nquite a spirited-looking \"article.\" A few months before he fled he had\r\nbeen sold, at which time his age was given as \"only twenty.\" He had\r\nsuffered considerably from various abuses; the hope of Canada however\r\ntended to make him joyful.\r\n\r\nThe system of oppression from which these travelers fled had afforded\r\nthem no privileges in the way of learning to read. All that they had\r\never known of civilization was what they perchance picked up in the\r\nordinary routine of the field.\r\n\r\nNotice of the fourth passenger unfortunately is missing.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM BALTIMORE COUNTY, 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\nELIZABETH WILLIAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nElizabeth fled in company with her brother the winter previous to her\r\narrival at the Philadelphia station. Although she reached free land the\r\nsevere struggle cost her the loss of all her toes. Four days and nights\r\nout in the bitter cold weather without the chance of a fire left them a\r\nprey to the frost, which made sad havoc with their feet\r\nespecially--particularly Elizabeth's. She was obliged to stop on the\r\nway, and for seven months she was unable to walk.\r\n\r\nElizabeth was about twenty years of age, chestnut color, and of\r\nconsiderable natural intellect. Although she suffered so severely as the\r\nresult of her resolution to throw off the yoke, she had no regrets at\r\nleaving the prison-house; she seemed to appreciate freedom all the more\r\nin consequence of what it cost her to obtain the prize.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the life she had lived, she stated that her mistress was\r\n\"good enough,\" but her \"master was a very bad man.\" His name was Samuel\r\nWard; he lived in Baltimore county, near Wrightstown. Elizabeth left her\r\nmother, four brothers and one sister under the yoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARY COOPER AND MOSES ARMSTEAD, 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMary arrived from Delaware, Moses from Norfolk, Virginia, and happened\r\nto meet at the station in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nMary was twenty years of age, of a chestnut color, usual size, and well\r\ndisposed. She fled from Nathaniel Herne, an alderman. Mary did not find\r\nfault with the alderman, but she could not possibly get along with his\r\nwife; this was the sole cause of her escape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoses was twenty-four years of age, of a chestnut color, a\r\nbright-looking young man. He fled from Norfolk, Virginia, having been\r\nowned by the estate of John Halters. Nothing but the prevailing love of\r\nliberty in the breast of Moses moved him to seek his freedom. He did not\r\nmake one complaint of bad treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM NEAR WASHINGTON, D.C.\r\n\r\nJOHN JOHNSON AND LAWRENCE THORNTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn escaped from near Washington. He stated that he was owned by an\r\nengraver, known by the name of William Stone, and added that himself and\r\nseven others were kept working on the farm of said Stone for nothing.\r\nJohn did not, however, complain of having a hard master in this\r\nhard-named personage, (Stone); for, as a slave, he confessed that he had\r\nseen good times. Yet he was not satisfied; he felt that he had a right\r\nto his freedom, and that he could not possibly be contented while\r\ndeprived of it, for this reason, therefore, he dissolved his\r\nrelationship with his kind master.\r\n\r\nJohn was about twenty-seven years of age, smart, possessed good manners,\r\nand a mulatto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLawrence was about twenty-three years of age, tall and slender, of dark\r\ncomplexion, but bright intellectually. With Lawrence times had been\r\npretty rough. Dr. Isaac Winslow of Alexandria was accused of defrauding\r\nLawrence of his hire. \"He was anything else but a gentleman,\" said\r\nLawrence. \"He was not a fair man no way, and his wife was worse than he\r\nwas, and she had a daughter worse than herself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Last Sunday a week my master collared me, for my insolence he said, and\r\ntold me that he would sell me right off. I was tied and put up stairs\r\nfor safe keeping. I was tied for about eight hours. I then untied\r\nmyself, broke out of prison, and made for the Underground Rail Road\r\nimmediately.\"\r\n\r\nLawrence gave a most interesting account of his life of bondage, and of\r\nthe doctor and his family. He was overjoyed at the manner in which he\r\nhad defeated the doctor, and so was the Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHON. L. McLANE'S PROPERTY, SOON AFTER HIS DEATH, TRAVELS _viâ_ THE\r\nUNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD.--WILLIAM KNIGHT, ESQ., LOSES A SUPERIOR\r\n\"ARTICLE.\"\r\n\r\nJIM SCOTT, TOM PENNINGTON, SAM SCOTT, BILL SCOTT, ABE BACON, AND JACK\r\nWELLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn unusual degree of pleasure was felt in welcoming this party of young\r\nmen, not because they were any better than others, or because they had\r\nsuffered more, but simply because they were found to possess certain\r\nknowledge and experience of slave life, as it existed under the\r\ngovernment of the chivalry; such information could not always be\r\nobtained from those whose lot had been cast among ordinary\r\nslave-holders. Consequently the Committee interviewed them closely, and\r\nin point of intellect found them to be above the average run of slaves.\r\nAs they were then entered on the record, so in like manner are the notes\r\nmade of them transferred to these pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJim was about nineteen years of age, well grown, black, and of\r\nprepossessing appearance. The organ of hope seemed very strong in him.\r\nJim had been numbered with the live stock of the late Hon. L. McLane,\r\nwho had been called to give an account of his stewardship about two\r\nmonths before Jim and his companions \"took out.\"\r\n\r\nAs to general usage, he made no particular charge against his\r\ndistinguished master; he had, however, not been living under his\r\nimmediate patriarchal government, but had been hired out to a farmer by\r\nthe name of James Dodson, with whom he experienced life \"sometimes hard\r\nand sometimes smooth,\" to use his own words. The reason of his leaguing\r\nwith his fellow-servants to abandon the old prison-house, was traceable\r\nto the rumor, that he and some others were to appear on the stage, or\r\nrather the auction-block, in Baltimore, the coming Spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTom, another member of the McLane institution, was about twenty-five\r\nyears of age, of unmixed blood, and a fair specimen of a well-trained\r\nfield-hand. He conceived that he had just ground to bring damages\r\nagainst the Hon. L. McLane for a number of years of hard service, and\r\nfor being deprived of education. He had been compelled to toil for the\r\nHonorable gentleman, not only on his own place, but on the farms of\r\nothers. At the time that Tom escaped, he was hired for one hundred\r\ndollars per annum (and his clothes found him), which hire McLane had\r\nwithheld from him contrary to all justice and fair dealing; but as Tom\r\nwas satisfied, that he could get no justice through the Maryland courts,\r\nand knew that an old and intimate friend of his master had already\r\nproclaimed, that \"negroes had no rights which white men are bound to\r\nrespect;\" also, as his experience tended to confirm him in the belief,\r\nthat the idea was practically carried out in the courts of Maryland; he\r\nthought, that it would be useless to put in a plea for justice in\r\nMaryland. He was not, however, without a feeling of some satisfaction,\r\nthat his old master, in giving an account of his stewardship at the Bar\r\nof the Just One, would be made to understand the amount of his\r\nindebtedness to those whom he had oppressed. With this impression, and\r\nthe prospects of equal rights and Canada, under her British Majesty's\r\npossessions, he manifested as much delight as if he was traveling with a\r\nhalf million of dollars in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSam, another likely-looking member of this party, was twenty-two years\r\nof age, and a very promising-looking young fugitive, having the\r\nappearance of being able to take education without difficulty. He had\r\nfully made up his mind, that slavery was never intended for man, and\r\nthat he would never wear himself out working for the \"white people for\r\nnothing.\" He wanted to work for himself and enjoy the benefits of\r\neducation, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBill Scott, another member of the McLane party, was twenty-one years of\r\nage, \"fat and slick,\" and fully satisfied, that Canada would agree with\r\nhim in every particular. Not a word did he utter in favor of Maryland,\r\nbut said much against the manner in which slaves were treated, how he\r\nhad felt about the matter, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbe was also from the McLane estate. He possessed apparently more\r\ngeneral intelligence than either of his companions. He was quite\r\nbright-witted, a ready talker, and with his prospects he was much\r\nsatisfied. He was twenty-two years of age, black, good-looking, and\r\npossessed very good manners. He represented, that his distinguished\r\nmaster died, leaving thirteen head of slaves. His (Abe's) father, Tom's\r\nmother and the mother of the Scotts were freed by McLane. Strong hopes\r\nwere entertained that before the old man's death he would make provision\r\nin his will for the freedom of all the other slaves; when he died, the\r\ncontrary was found to be the fact; they were still left in chains. The\r\nimmediate heirs consisted of six sons and five daughters, who moved in\r\nthe first circle, were \"very wealthy and aristocratic.\" Abe was\r\nconversant with the fact, that his master, the \"Hon. L. McLane, was once\r\nSecretary under President Jackson;\" that he had been \"sent to England on\r\na mission for the Government,\" and that he had \"served two terms in\r\nCongress.\" Some of the servants, Abe said, were \"treated pretty well,\r\nbut some others could not say anything in the master's favor.\" Upon the\r\nwhole, however, it was manifest that the McLane slaves had not been\r\namong the number who had seen severe hardships. They came from his\r\nplantation in Cecil county, Maryland, where they had been reared.\r\n\r\nIn order to defend themselves on the Underground Rail Road, they were\r\nstrongly armed. Sam had a large horse pistol and a butcher knife; Jack\r\nhad a revolver; Abe had a double-barrelled pistol and a large knife; Jim\r\nhad a single-barrelled pistol and counted on \"blowing a man down if any\r\none touched\" him. Bill also had a single-barrelled pistol, and when he\r\nstarted resolved to \"come through or die.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough this party was of the class said to be well fed, well clothed,\r\nand not over-worked, yet to those who heard them declare their utter\r\ndetestation of slavery and their determination to use their instruments\r\nof death, even to the taking of life, rather than again be subjected to\r\nthe yoke, it was evident that even the mildest form of slavery was\r\nabhorrent. They left neither old nor young masters, whom they desired to\r\nserve any longer or look up to for care and support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJack, who was not of the McLane party, but who came with them, had been\r\nkept in ignorance with regard to his age. He was apparently middle-aged,\r\nmedium size, dark color, and of average intelligence. He accused William\r\nKnight, a farmer, of having enslaved him contrary to his will or wishes,\r\nand averred that he fled from him because he used him badly and kept\r\nmean overseers. Jack said that his master owned six farms and kept three\r\noverseers to manage them. The slaves numbered twenty-one head. The names\r\nof the overseers were given in the following order: \"Alfred King, Jimmy\r\nAllen, and Thomas Brockston.\" In speaking of their habits, Jack said,\r\nthat they were \"very smart when the master was about, but as soon as he\r\nwas gone they would instantly drop back.\" \"They were all mean, but the\r\nold boss was meaner than them all,\" and \"the overseers were 'fraider' of\r\nhim than what I was,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\nHis master (Mr. Knight), had a wife and seven children, and was a member\r\nof the Episcopal Church, in \"good and regular standing.\" He was rich,\r\nand, with his family, moved in good society. \"His wife was too stingy to\r\nlive, and if she was to die, she would die holding on to something,\"\r\nsaid Jack. Jack had once had a wife and three children, but as they\r\nbelonged to a slave-holder (\"Jim Price\") Jack's rights were wholly\r\nignored, and he lost them.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM HARFORD CO., 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN MYERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn fled from under the yoke of Dr. Joshua R. Nelson. Until within two\r\nyears of \"Jack's\" flight, the doctor \"had been a very fine man,\" with\r\nwhom Jack found no fault. But suddenly his mode of treatment changed; he\r\nbecame very severe. Nothing that Jack could do, met the approval of the\r\ndoctor. Jack was constantly looked upon with suspicion.\r\n\r\nThe very day that Jack fled, four men approached him (the doctor one of\r\nthem), with line in hand; that sign was well understood, and Jack\r\nresolved that they should not get within tying distance of him. \"I\r\ndodged them,\" said Jack. Never afterwards was Jack seen in that part of\r\nthe country, at least as long as a fetter remained.\r\n\r\nThe day that he \"dodged\" he also took the Underground Rail Road, and\r\nalthough ignorant of letters, he battled his way out of Maryland, and\r\nsucceeded in reaching Pennsylvania and the Committee. He was obliged to\r\nleave four children behind--John, Abraham, Jane and Ellen.\r\n\r\nJack's wife had been freed and had come to Philadelphia two years in\r\nadvance of him. His master evidently supposed that Jack would be mean\r\nenough to wish to see his wife, even in a free State, and that no slave,\r\nwith such an unnatural desire, could be tolerated or trusted, that the\r\nsooner such \"articles\" were turned into cash the better. This in\r\nsubstance, was the way Jack accounted for the sudden change which had\r\ncome over his master. In defense of his course, Jack referred to the\r\ntreatment which he had received while in servitude under his old master,\r\nin something like the following words: \"I served under my young master's\r\nfather, thirty-five years, and from him received kind treatment. I was\r\nhis head man on the place, and had everything to look after.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND, 1857.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM LEE, SUSAN JANE BOILE AND AMARIAN LUCRETIA RISTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough these three passengers arrived in Philadelphia at the same\r\ntime, they did not come from Maryland together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Lee found himself under the yoke on a farm in the possession of\r\nZechariah Merica, who, Wm. said, was a \"low ignorant man, not above a\r\ncommon wood-chopper, and owned no other slave property than William.\"\r\nAgainst him, however, William brought no accusation of any very severe\r\ntreatment; on the contrary, his master talked sometimes \"as though he\r\nwanted to be good and get religion, but said he could not while he was\r\ntrying to be rich.\" Everything looked hopeless in William's eyes, so far\r\nas the master's riches and his own freedom were concerned. He concluded\r\nthat he would leave him the \"bag to hold alone.\" William therefore laid\r\ndown \"the shovel and the hoe,\" and, without saying a word to his master,\r\nhe took his departure, under the privacy of the night, for Canada.\r\nWilliam represented the white and colored races about equally; he was\r\nabout twenty-seven years of age, and looked well fitted for a full day's\r\nwork on a farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan Jane came from New Market, near Georgetown Cross-Roads, where she\r\nhad been held to unrequited labor by Hezekiah Masten, a farmer. Although\r\nhe was a man of fair pretensions, and a member of the Methodist Church,\r\nhe knew how to draw the cords very tightly, with regard to his slaves,\r\nkeeping his feet on their necks, to their sore grievance. Susan endured\r\nhis bad treatment as long as she could, then left, destitute and alone.\r\nHer mother and father were at the time living in Elkton, Md. Whether\r\nthey ever heard what became of their daughter is not known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmarian was twenty-one years of age, a person of light color, medium\r\nsize, with a prepossessing countenance and smart; she could read, write,\r\nand play on the piano. From a child, Amarian had been owned by Mrs.\r\nElizabeth Key Scott, who resided near Braceville, but at the time of her\r\nflight she was living at Westminster, in the family of a man named\r\n\"Boile,\" said to be the clerk of the court. In reference to treatment,\r\nAmarian said: \"I have always been used very well; have had it good all\r\nmy life, etc.\" This was a remarkable case, and, at first, somewhat\r\nstaggered the faith of the Committee, but they could not dispute her\r\ntestimony, consequently they gave her the benefit of the doubt. She\r\nspoke of having a mother living in Hagerstown, by the name of Amarian\r\nBallad, also three sisters who were slaves, and two who were free; she\r\nalso had a brother in chains in Mississippi.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM NORFOLK, VA. 1857.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM CARNEY AND ANDREW ALLEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam was about fifty-one years of age, a man of unmixed blood.\r\nPhysically he was a superior man, and his mental abilities were quite\r\nabove the average of his class.\r\n\r\nHe belonged to the estate of the late Mrs. Sarah Twyne, who bore the\r\nreputation of being a lady of wealth, and owned one hundred and twelve\r\nslaves. Most of her slave property was kept on her plantation not far\r\nfrom Old Point Comfort. According to William's testimony \"of times Mrs.\r\nTwyne would meddle too freely with the cup, and when under its influence\r\nshe was very desperate, and acted as though she wanted to kill some of\r\nthe slaves.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the evil spirit left her and she had regained her wonted\r\ncomposure, she would pretend that she loved her \"negroes,\" and would\r\nmake a great fuss over them. Not infrequently she would have very\r\nserious difficulty with her overseers. Having license to do as they\r\npleased, they would of course carry their cruelties to the most extreme\r\nverge of punishment. If a slave was maimed or killed under their\r\ncorrection, it was no loss of theirs. \"One of the overseers by the name\r\nof Bill Anderson once shot a young slave man called Luke and wounded him\r\nso seriously that he was not expected to live.\" \"At another time one of\r\nthe overseers beat and kicked a slave to death.\" This barbarity caused\r\nthe mistress to be very much \"stirred up,\" and she declared that she\r\nwould not have any more white overseers; condemned them for everything,\r\nand decided to change her policy in future and to appoint her overseers\r\nfrom her own slaves, setting the property to watch the property. This\r\nsystem was organized and times were somewhat better.\r\n\r\nWilliam had been hired out almost his entire life. For the last twelve\r\nor fifteen years he had been accustomed to hire his time for one hundred\r\nand thirty dollars per annum. In order to meet this demand he commonly\r\nresorted to oystering. By the hardest toil he managed to maintain\r\nhimself and family in a humble way.\r\n\r\nFor the last twenty years (prior to his escape) the slaves had\r\nconstantly been encouraged by their mistress' promises to believe that\r\nat her death all would be free, and transported to Liberia, where they\r\nwould enjoy their liberty and be happy the remainder of their days.\r\n\r\nWith full faith in her promises year by year the slaves awaited her\r\ndemise with as much patience as possible, and often prayed that her time\r\nmight be shortened for the general good of the oppressed. Fortunately,\r\nas the slaves thought, she had no children or near relatives to deprive\r\nthem of their just and promised rights.\r\n\r\nIn November, previous to William's escape, her long looked-for\r\ndissolution took place. Every bondman who was old enough to realize the\r\nnature and import of the change felt a great anxiety to learn what the\r\nwill of their old mistress said, whether she had actually freed them or\r\nnot. Alas! when the secret was disclosed, it was ascertained that not a\r\nfetter was broken, not a bond unloosed, and that no provision whatever\r\nhad been made looking towards freedom. In this sad case, the slaves\r\ncould imagine no other fate than soon to be torn asunder and scattered.\r\nThe fact was soon made known that the High Sheriff had administered on\r\nthe estate of the late mistress; it was therefore obvious enough to\r\nWilliam and the more intelligent slaves that the auction block was near\r\nat hand.\r\n\r\nThe trader, the slave-pen, the auction-block, the coffle gang, the rice\r\nswamp, the cotton plantation, bloodhounds, and cruel overseers loomed up\r\nbefore him, as they had never done before. Without stopping to consider\r\nthe danger, he immediately made up his mind that he would make a\r\nstruggle, cost what it might. He knew of no other way of escape than the\r\nUnderground Rail Road. He was shrewd enough to find an agent, who gave\r\nhim private instructions, and to whom he indicated a desire to travel\r\nNorth on said road. On examination he was deemed reliable, and a mutual\r\nunderstanding was entered into between. William and one of the\r\naccommodating Captains running on the Richmond and Philadelphia Line, to\r\nthe effect that he, William, should have a first class Underground Rail\r\nRoad berth, so perfectly private that even the law-officers could not\r\nfind him.\r\n\r\nThe first ties to be severed were those which bound him to his wife and\r\nchildren, and next to the Baptist Church, to which he belonged. His\r\nfamily were slaves, and bore the following names: his wife, Nancy, and\r\nchildren, Simon Henry, William, Sarah, Mary Ann, Elizabeth, Louis, and\r\nCornelius. It was no light matter to bid them farewell forever. The\r\nseparation from them was a trial such as rarely falls to the lot of\r\nmortals; but he nerved himself for the undertaking, and when the hour\r\narrived his strength was sufficient for the occasion.\r\n\r\nThus in company with Andrew they embarked for an unknown shore, their\r\nentire interests entrusted to a stranger who was to bring them through\r\ndifficulties and dangers seen and unseen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew was about twenty-four years of age, very tall, quite black, and\r\nbore himself manfully. He too was of the same estate that William\r\nbelonged to. He had served on the farm as a common farm laborer. He had\r\nhad it \"sometimes rough and sometimes smooth,\" to use his own language.\r\nThe fear of what awaited the slaves prompted Andrew to escape. He too\r\nwas entangled with a wife and one child, with whom he parted only as a\r\nfriend parts with a companion when death separates them. Catharine was\r\nthe name of Andrew's wife; and Anna Clarissa the name of his child left\r\nin chains.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM HOOPESVILLE, MD., 1857.\r\n\r\nJAMES CAIN, \"GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON,\" AND ANNA PERRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese passengers came from the field where as slaves very few privileges\r\nhad been afforded them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJim was about thirty-five years of age, a dark brown skin with average\r\nintellect for one in his condition. He had toiled under John Burnham, in\r\nDorchester county, from whom he had received hard treatment, but harder\r\nstill from his mistress. He averred that she was the cause of matters\r\nbeing so hard with the slaves on the place. Jim contented himself under\r\nhis lot as well as be could until within a short time of his escape when\r\nhe learned that measures were on foot to sell him. The fear of this\r\nchange brought him directly to meditate upon a trip to Canada. Being a\r\nmarried man he found it hard to leave his wife, Mary, but as she was\r\nalso a slave, and kept in the employment of her owners at some distance\r\nfrom where he lived, he decided to say nothing to her of his plans, but\r\nto start when ready and do the best he could to save himself, as he saw\r\nno chance of saving her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON.\" When the above \"article\" gave the Committee\r\nhis name they were amused and thought that he was simply jesting, having\r\ndone a smart thing in conquering his master by escaping; but on a fuller\r\ninvestigation they found that he really bore the name, and meant to\r\nretain it in Canada. It had been given him when a child, and in Slavery\r\nhe had been familiarly called \"Andy,\" but since he had achieved his\r\nfreedom he felt bound to be called by his proper name.\r\n\r\nGeneral Andrew was about twenty-seven years of age, a full black, and a\r\nman of extraordinary muscular powers, with coarse hard features, such as\r\nshowed signs that it would not be safe for his master to meddle with him\r\nwhen the General's blood was up.\r\n\r\nHe spoke freely of the man who claimed him as a slave, saying that his\r\nname was Shepherd Houston, of Lewistown, Delaware, and that he owned\r\nseven head of \"God's poor,\" whom he compelled to labor on his farm\r\nwithout a cent of pay, a day's schooling, or an hour's freedom;\r\nfurthermore, that he was a member of the Ebenezer Methodist Church, a\r\nclass-leader, and an exhorter, and in outward show passed for a good\r\nChristian. But in speaking of his practical dealings with his slaves,\r\nGeneral said that he worked them hard, stinted them shamefully for food,\r\nand kept them all the time digging.\r\n\r\nAlso when testifying with regard to the \"weaker vessel,\" under whose\r\ntreatment he had suffered much, the General said that his master's wife\r\nhad a meaner disposition than he had; she pretended to belong to church\r\ntoo, said General, but it was nothing but deceit.\r\n\r\nThis severe critic could not read, but he had very clear views on the\r\nethics of his master and mistress, agreeing with Scripture concerning\r\nwhited sepulchres, etc.\r\n\r\nThe question of Christian slave-holders, for a great while, seriously\r\npuzzled the wise and learned, but for the slave it was one of the\r\neasiest of solution. All the slaves came to the same conclusion,\r\nnotwithstanding the teaching of slave-holders on the one idea, that\r\n\"servants should obey their masters,\" etc.\r\n\r\nGeneral had a brother in Baltimore, known by the name of Josephus, also\r\ntwo sisters Anna and Annie; his father was living at Cannon's Ferry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnna Perry was the intended of General. She was about nineteen years of\r\nage, of a dark brown color, and came from the same neighborhood.\r\nAccording to law Anna was entitled to her freedom, but up to the time of\r\nher escape she had not been permitted to enjoy the favor. She found that\r\nif she would be free she would have to run for it.\r\n\r\nJohn Smith. A better specimen of one who had been ill treated, and in\r\nevery way uncared for, could not be easily found. In speech, manners,\r\nand whole appearance he was extremely rude. He was about twenty years of\r\nage, and in color was of a very dark hue.\r\n\r\nThat John had received only the poorest kind of \"corn-field fare\" was\r\nclearly evidenced both by body and mind. Master George H. Morgan was\r\ngreatly blamed for John's deficiencies; it was on his farms, under mean\r\noverseers that John had been crushed and kept under the harrow.\r\n\r\nHis mother, Mary Smith, he stated, his master had sold away to New\r\nOrleans, some two years before his escape. The sad effect that this\r\ncruel separation had upon him could only be appreciated by hearing him\r\ntalk of it in his own untutored tongue. Being himself threatened with\r\nthe auction-block, he was awakened to inquire how he could escape the\r\ndanger, and very soon learned that by following the old methods which\r\nhad been used by many before him, resolution and perseverance, he might\r\ngain the victory over master and overseers. As green as he seemed he had\r\nsucceeded admirably in his undertaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND, 1858.\r\n\r\nGEORGE RUSSELL AND JAMES HENRY THOMPSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nJames, for convenience' sake, was supplied with two other names (Milton\r\nBrown and John Johnson), not knowing exactly how many he would need in\r\nfreedom or which would be the best adapted to keep his whereabouts the\r\nmost completely veiled from his master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge reported that he fled from Henry Harris, who lived near Baltimore\r\non the Peach Orchard Road, and that he had lived with said Harris all\r\nhis life. He spoke of him as being a \"blustering man, who never liked\r\nthe slaves to make anything for themselves.\" George bore witness that\r\nthe usage which he had received had been hard; evidently his intellect\r\nhad been seriously injured by what he had suffered under his\r\ntask-master. George was of a very dark hue, but not quite up to medium\r\nsize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Henry Thompson did not accompany George, but met him at the\r\nstation in Philadelphia. He contrasted favorably with George, being\r\nabout twenty-eight years of age, with a countenance indicative of\r\nintelligence and spirit. He was of a chestnut color and of average size.\r\nHe charged one Dennis Mannard, of Johnsonville, with being his personal\r\nenemy as an oppressor, and added that he could \"say nothing good of\r\nhim.\" He could say, however, that Mannard was bitterly opposed to a\r\nslave's learning how to read, would not listen to the idea of giving\r\nthem any privileges, and tried to impress them with the idea that they\r\nneeded to know nothing but simply how to work hard for the benefit of\r\ntheir masters and mistresses; in fulfilling these conditions faithfully\r\nthe end for which they had been designed would be accomplished according\r\nto his doctrine.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding so much pains had been resorted to throughout the South\r\nto impress these ideas upon the slaves, no converts were made.\r\n\r\nJames thought that the doctrine was infamous, and that it was dangerous\r\nto live with such a man as his master; that freedom was as much his\r\nright as it was his master's; and so he resolved to leave for Canada as\r\nsoon as he could see any chance for escape.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM QUEEN ANN COUNTY, 1858.\r\n\r\nCATHARINE JONES AND SON HENRY, ETNA ELIZABETH DAUPHUS, AND GEORGE NELSON\r\nWASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese passengers, although interesting, and manifesting a strong desire\r\nto be free, had no remarkable tales of personal suffering to relate;\r\ntheir lot had evidently been cast among the more humane class of\r\nslave-holders, who had acted towards their slaves with some moderation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCatharine was twenty-four years of age, of a dark chestnut color,\r\npossessed a fair share of mother wit, and was fitted to make a favorable\r\nimpression. In no degree whatever did she think well of slavery; she had\r\nhad, as she thought, sufficient experience under Joshua Duvall (who\r\nprofessed to own her) to judge as to the good or evil of the system.\r\nWhile he was by no means considered a hard man, he would now and then\r\nbuy and sell a slave. She had no fault to find with her mistress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEtna was about twenty years of age, of a \"ginger-bread\" color, modest in\r\ndemeanor, and appeared to have a natural capacity for learning. She was\r\nalso from under the Duvall yoke. In setting forth her reasons for\r\nescaping she asserted that she was tired of slavery and an unbeliever in\r\nthe doctrine that God made colored people simply to be slaves for white\r\npeople; besides, she had a strong desire to \"see her friends in Canada.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge also escaped from Duvall; happily he was only about nineteen\r\nyears of age, not too old to acquire some education and do well by\r\nhimself. He was greatly elated at the prospect of freedom in Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry was a plump little fellow only two years of age. At the\r\nold price (five dollars per pound) he was worth something, fat as he\r\nwas. Being in the hands of his mother, the Committee considered him a\r\nlucky child.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM BALTIMORE.\r\n\r\nELIJAH BISHOP AND WILLIAM WILLIAMSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElijah represented to the Committee that he had been held under the\r\nenthrallment of a common \"gambler and drunkard,\" who called himself by\r\nthe name of Campbell, and carried on his sporting operations in\r\nBaltimore.\r\n\r\nUnder this gambler Elijah had been wronged up to the age of twenty-eight\r\nyears, when he resolved to escape. Having had several opportunities of\r\ntraveling through the United States and South America with his sporting\r\nmaster, he managed to pick up quite an amount of information. For the\r\nbenefit of Elijah's relatives, if any should have occasion to look for\r\nparticulars concerning this lost individual, we add, that he was a\r\nspare-built man of a dark color.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Williamson fled from Mrs. Rebecca Davidge, of Perrymanville. He\r\ndeclared that he had been used badly--had been worked hard and had been\r\nfed and clothed but poorly. Under such treatment he had reached his\r\ntwenty-fourth year. Being of a resolute and determined mind, and feeling\r\nconsiderably galled by the burdens heaped upon him, he resolved that he\r\nwould take his chances on the Underground Rail Road. The only complaint\r\nthat he had to make against his mistress was, that she hired him to a\r\nman named Smith, a farmer, and a slave-holder of the meanest type, in\r\nWilliam's opinion. For many a day William will hold her responsible for\r\nabuses he received from him.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM DUNWOODY COUNTY, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nDARIUS HARRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most encouraging signs connected with the travel  _viâ_ the\r\nUnderground Rail Road was, that passengers traveling thereon were, as a\r\ngeneral thing, young and of determined minds. Darius, the subject of\r\nthis sketch, was only about twenty-one when he arrived. It could be seen\r\nin his looks that he could not be kept in the prison-house unless\r\nconstantly behind bars. His large head and its formation indicated a\r\nlarge brain. He stated that \"Thomas H. Hamlin, a hard case, living near\r\nDunwoody,\" had professed to own him. Darius alleged that this same\r\nHamlin, who had thus stripped him of every cent of his earnings was\r\ndoing the same thing by sixty others, whom he held in his grasp.\r\n\r\nWith regard to \"feeding and clothing\" Darius set Hamlin down as \"very\r\nhoggish;\" he also stated that he would sell slaves whenever he could. He\r\n(Darius), had been hired out in Petersburg from the age of ten; for the\r\nlast three years previous to his escape he had been bringing one hundred\r\nand fifty dollars a year into the coffers of his owners. Darius had not\r\nbeen ignorant of the cruelties of the slave system up to the time of his\r\nescape, for the fetters had been galling his young limbs for several\r\nyears; especially had the stringent slave laws given him the horrors.\r\nLoathing the system of slavery with his whole heart, he determined to\r\nperil his all in escaping therefrom; seeking diligently, he had found\r\nmeans by which he could carry his designs into execution.\r\n\r\nIn the way of general treatment, however, Darius said that bodily he had\r\nescaped \"abuses tolerably well.\" He left in slavery his father and\r\nmother, four brothers and one sister. He arrived by one of the Richmond\r\nboats.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVED FROM ALEXANDRIA, VA., 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOWNSEND DERRIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above-named escaped from a \"Dutchman\" by the name of Gallipappick,\r\nwho was in the confectionery business. For the credit of our German\r\ncitizens, it may be said, that slave-holders within their ranks were\r\nvery few. This was a rare case. The Committee were a little curious to\r\nknow how the German branch of civilization conducted when given\r\nunlimited control over human beings.\r\n\r\nIn answering the requisite questions, and in making his statement,\r\nTownsend gave entire satisfaction. His German master he spoke of as\r\nbeing a tolerably fair man, \"considering his origin.\" At least he\r\n(Townsend), had not suffered much from him; but he spoke of a woman,\r\nabout sixty, who had been used very badly under this Dutchman. He not\r\nonly worked her very hard, but, at the same time, he would beat her over\r\nthe head, and that in the most savage manner. His mistress was also\r\n\"Dutch,\" a \"great swabby, fat woman,\" with a very ill disposition.\r\nMaster and mistress were both members of the Episcopal Church. \"Mistress\r\ndrank, that was the reason she was so disagreeable.\"\r\n\r\nTownsend had been a married man for about seven months only. In his\r\neffort to obtain his own freedom he sought diligently to deliver his\r\nyoung wife. They were united heart and hand in the one great purpose to\r\nreach free land, but unfortunately the pursuers were on their track; the\r\nwife was captured and carried back, but the husband escaped. It was\r\nparticularly with a view of saving his poor wife that Townsend was\r\ninduced to peril his life, for she (the wife) was not owned by the same\r\nparty who owned Townsend, and was on the eve of being taken by her\r\nowners some fifty miles distant into the country, where the chances for\r\nintercourse between husband and wife would no longer be favorable.\r\nRather than submit to such an outrage, Townsend and his wife made the\r\nattempt aforementioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD CARROLL.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward, a youthful passenger about twenty-one years of age, slow of\r\nspeech, with a stammering utterance, and apparently crushed in spirits,\r\nclaimed succor and aid of the Committee. At first the Committee felt a\r\nlittle puzzled to understand, how one, apparently so deficient, could\r\nsucceed in surmounting the usual difficulties consequent upon traveling,\r\nvia the Underground Rail Road; but in conversing with him, they found\r\nhim possessed of more intelligence than they had supposed; indeed, they\r\nperceived that he could read and write a little, and that what he lacked\r\nin aptness of speech, he supplied as a thinker, and although he was slow\r\nhe was sure. He was owned by a man named John Lewis, who also owned\r\nabout seventy head of slaves, whom he kept on farms near the mouth of\r\nthe Sassafras River, in Sussex county.\r\n\r\nLewis had not only held Edward in bondage, but had actually sold him,\r\nwith two of his brothers, only the Saturday before his escape, to a\r\nGeorgia trader, named Durant, who was to start south with them on the\r\nsubsequent Monday. Moved almost to desperation at their master's course\r\nin thus selling them, the three brothers, after reflection, determined\r\nto save themselves if possible, and without any definite knowledge of\r\nthe journey, they turned their eyes towards the North Star, and under\r\nthe cover of night they started for Pennsylvania, not knowing whether\r\nthey would ever see the goodly land of freedom. After wandering for\r\nabout two weeks, having been lost often and compelled to lie out in all\r\nweathers, a party of pursuers suddenly came upon them. Both parties were\r\narmed; the fugitives therefore resolved to give their enemies battle,\r\nbefore surrendering. Edward felt certain that one of the pursuers\r\nreceived a cut from his knife, but the extent of the injury was unknown\r\nto him. For a time the struggle was of a very serious character; by\r\nusing his weapons skillfully, however, Edward managed to keep the\r\nhand-cuff off of himself, but was at this point separated from his two\r\nbrothers. No further knowledge of them did he possess; nevertheless, he\r\ntrusted that they succeeded in fighting their way through to freedom.\r\nHow any were successful in making their escape under such discouraging\r\ncircumstances is a marvel.\r\n\r\nEdward took occasion to review his master's conduct, and said that he\r\n\"could not recommend him,\" as he would \"drink and gamble,\" both of\r\nwhich, were enough to condemn him, in Edward's estimation, even though\r\nhe were passable in other respects. But he held him doubly guilty for\r\nthe way that he acted in selling him and his brothers.\r\n\r\nSo privately had his master transacted business with the trader, that\r\nthey were within a hair's breadth of being hand-cuffed, ere they knew\r\nthat they were sold. Probably no outrage will be remembered with\r\nfeelings of greater bitterness, than this proceeding on the part of the\r\nmaster; yet, when he reflected that he was thereby prompted to strike\r\nfor freedom, Edward was disposed to rejoice at the good which had come\r\nout of the evil.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM PETERSBURG, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES MASON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis passenger brought rare intelligence respecting the manner in which\r\nhe had been treated in Slavery. He had been owned by a lady named Judith\r\nBurton, who resided in Petersburg, and was a member of the Baptist\r\nChurch. She was the owner of five other slaves. James said that she had\r\nbeen \"the same as a mother\" to him; and on the score of how he came to\r\nescape, he said: \"I left for no other cause than simply to get my\r\nliberty.\" This was an exceptional case, yet he had too much sense to\r\ncontinue in such a life in preference to freedom. When he fled he was\r\nonly twenty-four years of age. Had he remained, therefore, he might have\r\nseen hard times before he reached old age; this fact he had well\r\nconsidered, as he was an intelligent young man.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT CARR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    $300 REWARD.--Ran away from the subscriber, on the 26th\r\n    December, 1857, Negro Man ROBERT CARR. He had on when last seen\r\n    on West River, a close-bodied blue cloth coat with brass\r\n    buttons, drab pantaloons, and a low crown and very narrow brim\r\n    beaver hat; he wore a small goatee, is pleasant when spoken to,\r\n    and very polite; about five feet ten inches high;\r\n    copper-colored. I will give $125 if taken in Anne Arundel,\r\n    Prince George's, Calvert or Montgomery county, $150 if taken in\r\n    the city of Baltimore; or $300 if taken out of the State and\r\n    secured so that I get him again.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    THOS. J. RICHARDSON,\r\n\r\n    West River, Anne Arundel county, Maryland.\r\n\r\n    j13-w&s3w\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert was too shrewd to be entrapped by the above reward. He sat down\r\nand counted the cost before starting; then with his knowledge of\r\nslaveholders when traveling he was cautious enough not to expose himself\r\nby day or night where he was liable to danger.\r\n\r\nHe had reached the age of thirty, and despite the opposition he had had\r\nto encounter, unaided he had learned to read, which with his good share\r\nof native intelligence, he found of service.\r\n\r\nWhilst Robert did not publish his mistress, he gave a plain statement of\r\nwhere he was from, and why he was found in the city of Brotherly Love in\r\nthe dead of Winter in a state of destitution. He charged the blame upon\r\na woman, whose name was Richardson, who, he said, was quite a \"fighter,\r\nand was never satisfied, except when quarreling and fighting with some\r\nof the slaves.\" He also spoke of a certain T.J. Richardson, a farmer and\r\na \"very driving man\" who was in the habit of oppressing poor men and\r\nwomen by compelling them to work in his tobacco, corn, and wheat fields\r\nwithout requiting them for their labor. Robert felt if he could get\r\njustice out of said Richardson he would be the gainer to the amount of\r\nmore than a thousand dollars in money besides heavy damages for having\r\ncheated him out of his education.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, he recalled the fact of Richardson's being a member\r\nof the church, and in a sarcastic manner added that his \"religious\r\npretensions might pass among slave-holders, but that it would do him no\r\ngood when meeting the Judge above.\" Being satisfied that he would there\r\nmeet his deserts Robert took a degree of comfort therefrom.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL OF A PARTY OF SIX, 1858.\r\n\r\nPLYMOUTH CANNON, HORATIO WILKINSON, LEMUEL MITCHELL, JOSIAH MITCHELL,\r\nGEORGE HENRY BALLARD, AND JOHN MITCHELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Garrett announced the coming of this party in the subjoined\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILMINGTON, 2 MO. 5th, 1858.\r\n\r\n    ESTEEMED FRIEND:--WILLIAM STILL:--I have information of 6\r\n    able-bodied men that are expected here to-morrow morning; they\r\n    may, to-morrow afternoon or evening, take the cars at Chester,\r\n    and most likely reach the city between 11 and 12 at night; they\r\n    will be accompanied by a colored man that has lived in\r\n    Philadelphia and is free; they may think it safer to walk to the\r\n    city than to go in the cars, but for fear of accident it may be\r\n    best to have some one at the cars to look out for them. I have\r\n    not seen them yet, and cannot certainly judge what will be best.\r\n    I gave a man 3 dollars to bring those men 15 miles to-night, and\r\n    I have been two miles in the country this afternoon, and gave a\r\n    colored man 2 dollars to get provisions to feed them. Hoping all\r\n    will be right, I remain thy friend,\r\n\r\n    HUMANITAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nArriving as usual in due time these fugitives were examined, and all\r\nfound to be extra field hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlymouth was forty-two years of age, of a light chestnut color, with\r\nkeen eyes, and a good countenance, and withal possessed of shrewdness\r\nenough to lead double the number that accompanied him. He had a strong\r\ndesire to learn to read, but there was no possible way of his gaining\r\nthe light; this he felt to be a great drawback.\r\n\r\nThe name of the man who had made merchandise of Plymouth was Nat Horsey,\r\nof Horsey's Cross Roads. The most striking characteristic in Horsey's\r\ncharacter, according to Plymouth's idea was, that he was very \"hard to\r\nplease, did not know when a slave did enough, had no idea that they\r\ncould get tired or that they needed any privileges.\" He was the owner of\r\nsix slaves, was engaged in farming and mercantile pursuits, and the\r\npostmaster of the borough in which he lived.\r\n\r\nWhen Plymouth parted with his wife with a \"full heart,\" he bade her\r\ngood-night, without intimating to her that he never expected to see her\r\nagain in this world; she evidently supposed that he was going home to\r\nhis master's place as usual, but instead he was leaving his companion\r\nand three children to wear the yoke as hitherto. He sympathized with\r\nthem deeply, but felt that he could render them no real good by\r\nremaining; he could neither live with his wife nor could he have any\r\ncommand over one of his children. Slavery demanded all, but allowed\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, Plymouth admitted that he had been treated even more\r\nfavorably than most slaves. The family thus bound consisted of his wife\r\nJane, and four children, as follows: Dorsey, William Francis, Mary\r\nEllen, and baby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHoratio was a little in advance of Plymouth in years, being forty-four\r\nyears of age. His physical outlines gave him a commanding appearance for\r\none who had worn the yoke as he had for so many years. He was of a\r\nyellow complexion, and very tall.\r\n\r\nAs a slave laborer he had been sweating and toiling to enrich a man by\r\nthe name of Thomas J. Hodgson, a farmer on a large scale, and owning\r\nabout a dozen slaves.\r\n\r\nHoratio gave him the character of being \"a man of a hidden temper,\" and\r\nafter the election of Buchanan he considered him a great deal worse than\r\never. Horatio told of a visit which his master made to Canada, and\r\nwhich, on his return, he had taken much pains to report to the slaves to\r\nthe effect that he had been there the previous summer, and saw the\r\ncountry for himself, adding in words somewhat as follows: \"Canada is the\r\nmeanest part of the globe that I ever found or heard of;--did not see\r\nbut one black or colored person in Canada,--inquired at the custom-house\r\nto know what became of all the blacks from the South, and was told that\r\nthey shipped them off occasionally and sent them round Cape Horn and\r\nsold them.\" In addition to this report he said that \"the suffering from\r\ndeep snows and starvation was fearful,\" all of which Horatio believed\r\n\"to be a lie.\" Of course he concealed this opinion from his master. Many\r\nsuch stories were sounded in the ears of slaves but without much effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLemuel, John and Josiah were brothers. Lemuel was thirty-five, and might\r\nbe called a jet-black. He was uncommonly stout, with a head indicative\r\nof determination of purpose, just suited to an Underground Rail Road\r\npassenger. He fled from James R. Lewis, \"a tall, stout man, very wealthy\r\nand close.\" Lemuel said that he fed and clothed the slaves pretty well.\r\nHe had invested to the extent of twelve head. No money or privileges\r\nwere allowed, and for a small offence the threat to sell was made. It\r\nwas Lemuel's opinion that his master's wife made him worse than he\r\notherwise would have been.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn was twenty-four years of age, of unmixed blood, and of a quiet\r\ndemeanour. He belonged to Miss Catharine Cornwell, of Viana. John\r\ndescribed her as \"tolerable good-looking, but real bad.\" His sister and\r\none other slave besides himself comprised her entire stock (of slaves).\r\n\r\nAccording to John's story, his mistress was in the habit of telling her\r\nslaves that she did not \"intend that any of them should be free if she\r\ncould help it;\" this sentiment was uttered so \"scornfully\" that it\r\n\"insulted\" Jack very much. Indeed, it was this that put the idea of\r\nCanada into his mind. The more she kept the idea of perpetual Slavery\r\nbefore the slaves, the more Jack resolved to make her arrogance cost her\r\none slave at least.\r\n\r\nMiss Cornwell was not only a warm advocate of Slavery, but was likewise\r\na member of the Methodist church, under the pastoral charge of the Rev.\r\nJ.C. Gregg. On one occasion, when the minister was visiting Miss C., the\r\nsubject of Slavery was introduced in John's hearing. The reverend\r\ngentleman took the ground that it was not right to hold slaves,--said\r\nthere were none in Pennsylvania, etc. The young mistress showed little\r\nor no sign of thinking otherwise while he remained, \"but, after he was\r\ngone, she raved and went on in a great way, and told her brother if he\r\n(the minister), ever married her, he would have to come out of his\r\nnotions about freedom.\" It was John's opinion that the subject of\r\nmatrimony was then under consideration between them. For himself, he was\r\nhighly delighted with the minister's \"notions of freedom,\" as he had\r\nheard so many high notions of Slavery.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the labor usage under the young mistress, John said that\r\nthey had been \"worked very hard, and especially last, and the present\r\nyear.\" \"Last year,\" he stated, \"they had hardly any meat, but were fed\r\nchiefly on herring. Seeing that it was going to be the same thing this\r\nyear too, I thought that if I could make my escape to Canada, I would do\r\nit.\" He had strong parental and kindred ties to break, but resolved to\r\nbreak them rather than remain under Miss Cornwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJosiah was twenty-three. A more promising-looking subject to represent\r\nthe fugitives in Canada, was not readily to be found. His appearance\r\nindicated that he was a young man of extra physical powers, at least,\r\none not likely to turn his face again towards Egypt.\r\n\r\nJosiah's gain was the loss of Thomas J. Hodgson (above alluded to). For\r\nfull three years this desire and determination to be free had been in\r\nJosiah's heart. The denial of his manhood nerved him to seek for refuge\r\nin a foreign clime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge, the last named in this party, gave his age as twenty-six. In\r\nappearance he was not behind any of his comrades. He fled from a farmer,\r\n(the late William Jackson), who owned, it was said, \"sixteen head.\" He\r\nhad recently died, leaving all his slaves in bondage. Seeing that the\r\nsettlement of the estate might necessitate the sale of some of the\r\nslaves, George thought that he had better not wait for the division of\r\nthe property or anything else, but push ahead with the first train for\r\nCanada. Slavery, as he viewed it, was nothing more nor less than\r\ndownright robbery. He left his mother, one sister, and other near kin.\r\nAfter George went to Canada, his heart yearned tenderly after his mother\r\nand sister, and, as the following letter will show, he was prepared to\r\nmake commendable exertions in their behalf:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ST. CATHARINES, JULY 19th, 1858.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:--With pleasure I now inform you that I am well, and\r\n    hope this may find you and yours the same also. I hope kind sir\r\n    you will please to see Mr. Paul Hammon, to know when he will try\r\n    to get my Mother and Sister I wish him to send me word when he\r\n    will go so I may meet him in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n    And I will Endevor to meet him there With some money to assist\r\n    him in getting them. Let me know when you start for them so I\r\n    may be able to meet you there, please after this letter passes\r\n    from you sir, give it to John Camper tell him to give it to his\r\n    Mother, so that my Mother can get it, be careful and not let no\r\n    white man get hold of it. I am now living with my cousin Leven\r\n    Parker, near Saint Catharines, $10 a month. No more at present,\r\n    from your friend,\r\n\r\n    GEORGE BALLARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inquiry may arise, as to how such passengers managed to get through\r\nMaryland and Delaware. But it cannot be expected that the manner in\r\nwhich each arrival traveled should be particularly described. It might\r\nnot be prudent even now, to give the names of persons still living in\r\nthe South, who assisted their fellow-men in the dark days of Slavery. In\r\norder, however, that some idea may be gathered as to the workings of one\r\nbranch of the road in Delaware (with names suppressed) we insert the\r\nfollowing original letter for what it may be worth.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CAMDEN, June 13, 1858.\r\n\r\n    MR.

He reported that he fled from Mr. John Tilghman Foster, a\r\nfarmer, living in the vicinity of Richmond. His master, Ebenezer\r\nunhesitatingly declared, was a first-rate man. \"I had no right to leave\r\nhim in the world, but I loved freedom better than Slavery.\" After fully\r\nsetting forth the kind treatment he had been accustomed to receive under\r\nhis master, a member of the Committee desired to know of him if he could\r\nread, to which he answered that he could, but he admitted that what\r\nknowledge he had obtained in this direction was the result of efforts\r\nmade stealthily, not through any license afforded by his master. John\r\nTilghman Foster held deeds for about one hundred and fifty head of\r\nslaves, and was a man of influence.\r\n\r\nEbenezer had served his time in the barber's shop. On escaping he\r\nforsook his parents, and eight brothers and sisters. As he was so\r\nintelligent, the Committee believed he would make his mark in life some\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM RICHMOND, 1858.\r\n\r\nJOHN THOMPSON CARR, ANN MOUNTAIN AND CHILD, AND WILLIAM BOWLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn was a sturdy-looking chattel, but possessed far less intelligence\r\nthan the generality of passengers. He was not too old, however, to\r\nimprove. The fact that he had spirit enough to resent the harsh\r\ntreatment of one Albert Lewis, a small farmer, who claimed to own him,\r\nshowed that he was by no means a hopeless case. With all his apparent\r\nstupidity he knew enough to give his master the name of a \"free whiskey\r\ndrinker,\" likewise of \"beating and fighting the slaves.\" It was on this\r\naccount that John was compelled to escape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnn Mountain arrived from Delaware with her child about the same time\r\nthat John did, but not in company with him; they met at the station in\r\nPhiladelphia. That Slavery had crippled her in every respect was very\r\ndiscernible; this poor woman had suffered from cuffing, etc., until she\r\ncould no longer endure her oppression. Taking her child in her arms, she\r\nsought refuge beyond the borders of slave territory. Ann was about\r\ntwenty-two years of age, her child not quite a year old. They were\r\nconsidered entitled to much pity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam was forty-one years of age, dark, ordinary size, and\r\nintelligent. He fled from Richmond, where he had been held by Alexander\r\nRoyster, the owner of fifteen slaves, and a tobacco merchant. William\r\nsaid that his master was a man of very savage temper, short, and\r\ncrabbed. As to his social relations, William said that he was \"a member\r\nof nothing now but a liquor barrel.\"\r\n\r\nKnowing that his master and mistress labored under the delusion that he\r\nwas silly enough to look up to them as kind-hearted slave-holders, to\r\nwhom he should feel himself indebted for everything, William thought\r\nthat they would be sadly puzzled to conjecture what had become of him.\r\nHe was sure that they would be slow to believe that he had gone to\r\nCanada. Until within the last five years he had enjoyed many privileges\r\nas a slave, but he had since found it not so easy to submit to the\r\nrequirements of Slavery. He left his wife, Nancy, and two children.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM BALTIMORE, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERTA TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of this sketch was a young mulatto woman, twenty-three years\r\nof age, who fled from the City of Baltimore. Both before and after her\r\nescape Roberta appeared to appreciate her situation most fully. Her\r\nlanguage concerning freedom had in it the ring of common sense, as had\r\nher remarks touching her slave life.\r\n\r\nIn making her grievances known to the Committee she charged Mr. and Mrs.\r\nMcCoy with having done great violence to her freedom and degrading her\r\nwomanhood by holding her in bonds contrary to her wishes. Of Mr. McCoy,\r\nhowever, she spoke less severely than she did of his \"better half.\"\r\nIndeed she spoke of some kind traits in his character, but said that his\r\nwife was one of \"the torn down, devilish dispositions, all the time\r\nquarreling and fighting, and would swear like an old sailor.\" It was in\r\nconsequence of these evil propensities that her ladyship was intolerable\r\nto Roberta. Without being indebted to her owners for any privileges, she\r\nhad managed to learn to read a little, which knowledge she valued highly\r\nand meant to improve in Canada.\r\n\r\nRoberta professed to be a Christian, and was a member of the Bethel\r\nMethodist Church. Her servitude, until within four years of her escape,\r\nhad been passed in Virginia, under Mrs. McCoy's father, when to\r\naccommodate the daughter she was transferred to Baltimore. Of her\r\nparentage or relatives no note was made on the book. It was sad to see\r\nsuch persons destitute and homeless, compelled to seek refuge among\r\nstrangers, not daring to ask the slightest favor, sympathy or prayer to\r\naid her, Christian as she was, from any Christian of Baltimore, wearing\r\na fair skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM HIGHTSTOWN, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT THOMPSON (A PREACHER).\r\n\r\n\r\nSlavery exempted from the yoke no man with a colored skin no matter what\r\nhis faith, talent, genius, or worth might be. The person of Christ in a\r\nblack skin would scarcely have caused it to relinquish its tyrannical\r\ngrasp; neither God nor man was regarded by men who dealt in the bodies\r\nand souls of their fellow-men. Robert stated to the Committee that he\r\nfled from \"John R. Laten, a very harsh kind of a farmer, who drank right\r\nsmart,\" that on the morning he \"took out,\" while innocent of having\r\ncommitted any crime, suddenly in a desperate fit of passion, his master\r\ntook him \"by the collar,\" at the same time calling loudly to \"John\" for\r\n\"ropes.\" This alarming assault on the part of his master made the\r\npreacher feel as though his Satanic majesty had possession of him. In\r\nsuch a crisis he evidently felt that preaching would do no good; he was,\r\nhowever, constrained to make an effort. To use his own words, he said:\r\n\"I gave a sudden jerk and started off on a trot, leaving my master\r\ncalling, 'stop! stop!' but I kept on running, and was soon out of\r\nsight.\"\r\n\r\nThe more he thought over the brutal conduct of his master the more\r\ndecided he became never to serve him more, and straightway he resolved\r\nto try to reach Canada. Being in the prime of his life (thirty-nine\r\nyears of age) and having the essential qualifications for traveling over\r\nthe Underground Rail Road, he was just the man to endure the trials\r\nconsequent upon such an undertaking.\r\n\r\nSaid Robert: \"I always thought slavery hard, a very dissipated life to\r\nlive. I always thought we colored people ought to work for ourselves and\r\nwives and children like other people.\" The Committee saw that Robert's\r\nviews were in every word sound doctrine, and for further light asked him\r\nsome questions respecting the treatment he had received at the hands of\r\nhis mistress, not knowing but that he had received kindness from the\r\n\"weaker vessel;\" while enduring suffering under his master; but Robert\r\nassured them in answer to this inquiry that his mistress was a very\r\n\"ill, dissipated woman,\" and \"was not calculated to sympathize with a\r\npoor slave.\" Robert was next interviewed with regard to religious\r\nmatters, when it was ascertained that he bore the name of being a \"local\r\npreacher of the gospel of the Bethel Methodist denomination.\" Thus in\r\nleaving slavery he had to forsake his wife and three children, kinfolks\r\nand church, which arduous task but for the brutal conduct of the master\r\nhe might have labored in vain for strength to perform.\r\n\r\nAs he looked calmly back upon the past, and saw how he and the rest of\r\nthe slaves had been deprived of their just rights he could hardly\r\nrealize how Providence could suffer slave-holders to do as they had been\r\ndoing in trampling upon the poor and helpless slaves. Yet he had strong\r\nfaith that the Almighty would punish slave-holders severely for their\r\nwickedness.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM VIRGINIA, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nALFRED S. THORNTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of this sketch was a young man about twenty-two years of\r\nage, of dark color, but bright intellectually. Alfred found no fault\r\nwith the ordinary treatment received at the hands of his master; he had\r\nevidently been on unusually intimate terms with him. Nor was any fault\r\nfound with his mistress, so far as her treatment of him was concerned;\r\nthus, comparatively, he was \"happy and contented,\" little dreaming of\r\ntrader or a change of owners. One day, to his utter surprise, he saw a\r\ntrader with a constable approaching him. As they drew nearer and nearer\r\nhe began to grow nervous. What further took place will be given, as\r\nnearly as possible, in Alfred's own words as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"William Noland (a constable), and the trader was making right\r\n    up to me almost on my heels, and grabbed at me, they were so\r\n    near. I flew, I took off-my hat and run, took off my jacket and\r\n    run harder, took off my vest and doubled my pace, the constable\r\n    and the trader both on the chase hot foot. The trader fired two\r\n    barrels of his revolver after me, and cried out as loud as he\r\n    could call, G----d d----n, etc., but I never stopped running,\r\n    but run for my master. Coming up to him, I cried out, Lord,\r\n    master, have you sold me? 'Yes,' was his answer. 'To the\r\n    trader,' I said. 'Yes,' he answered. 'Why couldn't you sold me\r\n    to some of the neighbors?' I said. 'I don't know,' he said, in a\r\n    dry way. With my arms around my master's neck, I begged and\r\n    prayed him to tell me why he had sold me. The trader and\r\n    constable was again pretty near. I let go my master and took to\r\n    my heels to save me. I run about a mile off and run into a mill\r\n    dam up to my head in water. I kept my head just above and hid\r\n    the rest part of my body for more than two hours. I had not made\r\n    up my mind to escape until I had got into the water. I run only\r\n    to have little more time to breathe before going to Georgia or\r\n    New Orleans; but I pretty soon made up my mind in the water to\r\n    try and get to a free State, and go to Canada and make the trial\r\n    anyhow, but I didn't know which way to travel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch great changes in Alfred's prospects having been wrought in so short\r\na while, together with such a fearful looking-for of a fate in the far\r\nSouth more horrid than death, suddenly, as by a miracle, he turns his\r\nface in the direction of the North. But the North star, as it were, hid\r\nits face from him. For a week he was trying to reach free soil, the rain\r\nscarcely ceasing for an hour. The entire journey was extremely\r\ndiscouraging, and many steps had to be taken in vain, hungry and weary.\r\nBut having the faith of those spoken of in the Scriptures, who wandered\r\nabout in dens and caves of the earth, being destitute, afflicted and\r\ntormented, he endured to the end and arrived safely to the Committee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nHe left his father and mother, both slaves, living near Middleburg, in\r\nVirginia, not far from where he said his master lived, who went by the\r\nname of C.E. Shinn, and followed farming. His master and mistress were\r\nsaid to be members of the \"South Baptist Church,\" and both had borne\r\ngood characters until within a year or so previous to Alfred's\r\ndeparture. Since then a very serious disagreement had taken place\r\nbetween them, resulting in their separation, a heavy lawsuit, and\r\nconsequently large outlays. It was this domestic trouble, in Alfred's\r\nopinion, that rendered his sale indispensable. Of the merits of the\r\ngrave charges made by his master against his mistress, Alfred professed\r\nto have formed no opinion; he knew, however, that his master blamed a\r\nschool-master, by the name of Conway, for the sad state of things in his\r\nhousehold. Time would fail to tell of the abundant joy Alfred derived\r\nfrom the fact, that his \"heels\" had saved him from a Southern market.\r\nEqually difficult would it be to express the interest felt by the\r\nCommittee in this passenger and his wonderful hair-breadth escape.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM BELLEAIR.\r\n\r\nJULIUS SMITH, WIFE MARY, AND BOY JAMES, HENRY AND EDWARD SMITH, AND JACK\r\nCHRISTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this party was very respectable in regard to numbers and enlisted\r\nmuch sympathy, still they had no wounds or bruises to exhibit, or very\r\nhard reports to make relative to their bondage. The treatment that had\r\nbeen meted out to them was about as tolerant as Slavery could well\r\nafford; and the physical condition of the passengers bore evidence that\r\nthey had been used to something better than herring and corn cake for a\r\ndiet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJulius, who was successful enough to bring his wife and boy with him,\r\nwas a wonderful specimen of muscular proportions. Although a young man,\r\nof but twenty-five, he weighed two hundred and twenty-five pounds; he\r\nwas tall and well-formed from the crown of his head to the soles of his\r\nfeet. Nor was he all muscle by a great deal; he was well balanced as to\r\nmother wit and shrewdness.\r\n\r\nIn looking back into the pit from whence he had been delivered he could\r\ntell a very interesting story of what he had experienced, from which it\r\nwas evident that he had not been an idle observer of what had passed\r\nrelative to the Peculiar Institution; especially was it very certain\r\nthat he had never seen anything lovely or of good report belonging to\r\nthe system. So far as his personal relations were concerned, he\r\nacknowledged that a man named Mr. Robert Hollan, had assumed to impose\r\nhimself upon him as master, and that this same man had also wrongfully\r\nclaimed all his time, denied him all common and special privileges;\r\nbesides he had deprived him of an education, etc., which looked badly\r\nenough before he left Maryland, but in the light of freedom, and from a\r\nfree State stand-point, the idea that \"man's inhumanity to man\" should\r\nassume such gigantic proportions as to cause him to seize his fellow-man\r\nand hold him in perpetual bondage, was marvellous in the extreme.\r\n\r\nJulius had been kept in the dark in Maryland, but on free soil, the\r\nlight rushed in upon his astonished vision to a degree almost\r\nbewildering. That his master was a man of \"means and pretty high\r\nstanding\"--Julius thought was not much to his credit since they were\r\nobtained from unpaid labor. In his review allusion was made not only to\r\nhis master, but also to his mistress, in which he said that she was \"a\r\nquarrelsome and crabbed woman, middling stout.\" In order to show a\r\nreason why he left as he did, he stated that \"there had been a fuss two\r\nor three times\" previous to the escape, and it had been rumored \"that\r\nsomebody would have to be sold soon.\" This was what did the mischief so\r\nfar as the \"running away\" was concerned. Julius' color was nearly jet\r\nblack, and his speech was very good considering his lack of book\r\nlearning; his bearing was entirely self-possessed and commendable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHis wife and boy shared fully in his affections, and seemed well pleased\r\nto have their faces turned Canada-ward. It is hardly necessary to say\r\nmore of them here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry was about twenty-three years of age, of an active turn, brown\r\nskin, and had given the question of freedom his most serious attention,\r\nas his actions proved. While he could neither read nor write, he could\r\nthink. From the manner in which he expressed himself, with regard to\r\nRobert Hollan, no man in the whole range of his recollections will be\r\nlonger remembered than he; his enthralment while under Hollan will\r\nhardly ever be forgotten. Any being who had been thus deprived of his\r\nrights, could hardly fail to command sympathy; in cases like this,\r\nhowever, the sight and language of such an one was extremely impressive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf this party, Edward, a boy of seventeen, called forth much sympathy;\r\nhe too was claimed by Hollan. He was of a good physical make-up, and\r\nseemed to value highly the great end he had in view, namely, a residence\r\nin Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND, 1858.\r\n\r\nJOHN WESLEY COMBASH, JACOB TAYLOR, AND THOMAS EDWARD SKINNER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe revelations made by these passengers were painful to listen to, and\r\nwould not have been credited if any room had existed for doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Wesley was thirty-two years of age, of a lively turn, pleasant\r\ncountenance, dark color, and ordinary size. In unburdening his mind to\r\nthe Committee the all-absorbing theme related to the manner in which he\r\nhad been treated as a slave, and the character of those who had\r\noppressed him. He stated that he had been the victim of a man or party,\r\nnamed Johnson, in whose family John had been a witness to some of the\r\nmost high-handed phases of barbarism; said he, \"these Johnsons were\r\nnotorious for abusing their servants. A few years back one of their\r\nslaves, a coachman, was kept on the coach box one cold night when they\r\nwere out at a ball until he became almost frozen to death, in fact he\r\ndid die in the infirmary from the effects of the frost about one week\r\nafterwards.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another case was that of a slave woman in a very delicate state, who\r\nwas one day knocked down stairs by Mrs. Johnson herself, and in a few\r\nweeks after, the poor woman died from the effects of the injury thus\r\nreceived. The doctor who attended the injured creature in this case was\r\nsimply told that she slipped and fell down stairs as she was coming\r\ndown. Colored witnesses had no right to testify, and the doctor was\r\nmute, consequently the guilty escaped wholly unpunished.\" \"Another\r\ncase,\" said John Wesley, \"was a little girl, half-grown, who was washing\r\nwindows up stairs one day, and unluckily fell asleep in the window, and\r\nin this position was found by her mistress; in a rage the mistress hit\r\nher a heavy slap, knocked her out of the window, and she fell to the\r\npavement, and died in a few hours from the effects thereof. The mistress\r\nprofessed to know nothing about it, simply said, 'she went to sleep and\r\nfell out herself.' As usual nothing was done in the way of punishment.\"\r\n\r\nThese were specimens of the inner workings of the peculiar institution.\r\nJohn, however, had not only observed Slavery from a domestic\r\nstand-point, he had also watched master and mistress abroad as visitors\r\nand guests in other people's houses, noticed not only how they treated\r\nwhite people, but also how they treated black people. \"These Johnsons\r\nthought that they were first-rate to their servants. When visiting among\r\ntheir friends they were usually very polite, would bow and scrape more\r\nthan a little, even to colored people, knowing that their names were in\r\nbad odor, on account of their cruelty, for they had been in the papers\r\ntwice about how they abused their colored people.\"\r\n\r\nAs to advertising him, John gave it as his opinion that they would be\r\nashamed to do it from the fact that they had already rendered themselves\r\nmore notorious than they had bargained for, on account of their cruelty\r\ntowards their slaves; they were wealthy, and courted the good opinion of\r\nsociety. Besides they were members of the Presbyterian Church, and John\r\nthought that they were very willing that people should believe that they\r\nwere great saints. On the score of feeding and clothing John gave them\r\ncredit, saying that \"the clothing was good enough, they liked to see the\r\nhouse servants dressed;\" he spoke too of the eating as being all right,\r\nbut added, that \"very often time was not allowed them to finish their\r\nmeals.\" Respecting work, John bore witness that they were very sharp.\r\n\r\nWith John's intelligence, large observation, good memory, and excellent\r\nnatural abilities, with the amount of detail that he possessed, nothing\r\nmore would have been needed for a thrilling book than the facts and\r\nincidents of slave life, as he had been conversant with it under the\r\nJohnsons in Maryland.\r\n\r\nAs the other two companions of John Wesley were advertised in the\r\n_Baltimore Sun_, we avail ourselves of the light thus publicly afforded:\r\n\r\n\r\n    $2000 REWARD.--Ran away from the subscriber, living on the York\r\n    Turnpike, eight miles from Baltimore city, on Sunday, April\r\n    11th, my negro man, JACOB, aged 20 years: 5 feet 10 inches high;\r\n    chestnut color; spare made; good features. I will give $50\r\n    reward if taken in Baltimore city or county, and $200 if taken\r\n    out of the State and secured in jail so that I get him again.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    WM. J.B. PARLETT.\r\n\r\n    a13-3t*||\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Jacob,\" answering to the description in Mr. Wm. J.B. Parlett's\r\nadvertisement, gave his views of the man who had enslaved him. His\r\nstatement is here transferred from the record book: \"My master,\" said\r\nJacob, \"was a farmer, a very rough man, hard to satisfy. I never knew of\r\nbut one man who could ever please him. He worked me very hard; he wanted\r\nto be beating me all the time.\" This was a luxury which Jacob had no\r\nappetite for, consequently he could not resist signifying his\r\nunwillingness to yield, although resistance had to be made at some\r\npersonal risk, as his master had \"no more regard for a colored man than\r\nhe had for a stone under his feet.\" With him the following expression\r\nwas common: \"The niggers are not worth a d----n.\" Nor was his wife any\r\nbetter, in Jacob's opinion. \"She was a cross woman, and as much of a\r\nboss as he was.\" \"She would take a club and with both hands would whack\r\naway as long as you would stand it.\" \"She was a large, homely woman;\r\nthey were common white people, with no reputation in the community.\"\r\nSubstantially this was Jacob's unvarnished description of his master and\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\nAs to his age, and also the name of his master, Jacob's statement varied\r\nsomewhat from the advertisement. For instance, Jacob Taylor was noticed\r\non the record book as being twenty-three years of age, and the name of\r\nhis master was entered as \"William Pollit;\" but as Jacob had never been\r\nallowed to learn to read, he might have failed in giving a correct\r\npronunciation of the name.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what first prompted him to seek his freedom, he replied, \"Oh\r\nmy senses! I always had it in my mind to leave, but I was 'jubus',\r\n(dubious?) of starting. I didn't know the way to come. I was afraid of\r\nbeing overtaken on the way.\" He fled from near Baltimore, where he left\r\nbrothers and other relatives in chains.\r\n\r\n\r\n    $20 REWARD.--Ran way at the same time and in company with the\r\n    above negro man, a bright mulatto boy named THOMAS SKINNER,\r\n    about 18 years old, 5 feet 8 inches high and tolerable stout\r\n    made; he only has a term of years to serve. I will pay $20\r\n    reward if delivered to me or lodged in jail so I can get him\r\n    again.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    GEO. H. CARMAN,\r\n\r\n    Towsontown, Baltimore county, Md.\r\n\r\n    a13-3t*||.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the same time that this advertisement came to hand a certain young\r\naspirant for Canada was entered on the Underground Rail Road Book thus:\r\n\"THOMAS EDWARD SKINNER, a bright mulatto, age eighteen years, well\r\nformed, good-looking, and wide awake; says, that he fled from one G.H.\r\nCarman, Esq., head Clerk of the County Court.\" He bore voluntary\r\ntestimony to Carman in the following words: \"He was a very good man; he\r\nfed and clothed well and gave some money too occasionally.\" Yet Thomas\r\nhad no idea of remaining in Slavery under any circumstances. He hated\r\neverything like Slavery, and as young as he was, he had already made\r\nfive attempts to escape. On this occasion, with older and wiser heads,\r\nhe succeeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM NEW MARKET, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nELIJAH SHAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis \"article\" reported himself as having been deprived of his liberty\r\nby Dr. Ephraim Bell, of Baltimore County, Maryland. He had no fault to\r\nfind with the doctor, however; on the contrary, he spoke of him as a\r\n\"very clever and nice man, as much so as anybody need to live with;\" but\r\nof his wife he could not speak so favorably; indeed, he described her as\r\na most tyrannical woman. Said Elijah, \"she would make a practice of\r\nrapping the broomstick around the heads of either men, women, or\r\nchildren when she got raised, which was pretty often. But she never\r\nrapped me, for I wouldn't stand it; I shouldn't fared any better than\r\nthe rest if I hadn't been resolute. I declared over and over again to\r\nher that I would scald her with the tea kettle if she ever took the\r\nbroomstick to me, and I meant it. She took good care to keep the\r\nbroomstick from about my head. She was as mischievous and stingy as she\r\ncould live; wouldn't give enough to eat or wear.\" These facts and many\r\nmore were elicited from Elijah, when in a calm state of mind and when\r\nfeeling much elated with the idea that his efforts in casting off the\r\nyoke were met with favor by the Committee, and that the accommodations\r\nand privileges on the road were so much greater than he had ever dreamed\r\nof. Such luck on the road was indeed a matter of wonder and delight to\r\npassengers generally. They were delighted to find that the Committee\r\nreceived them and forwarded them on \"without money and without price.\"\r\nElijah was capable of realizing the worth of such friendship. He was a\r\nyoung man twenty-three years of age, spare made, yellow complexion, of\r\nquick motion and decidedly collected in his bearing. In short, he was a\r\nman well adapted to make a good British subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM VIRGINIA, 1858.\r\n\r\nMARY FRANCES MELVIN, ELIZA HENDERSON, AND NANCY GRANTHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMary Frances hailed from Norfolk; she had been in servitude under Mrs.\r\nChapman, a widow lady, against whom she had no complaint to make;\r\nindeed, she testified that her mistress was very kind, although fully\r\nallied to slavery. She said that she left, not on account of bad\r\ntreatment, but simply because she wanted her freedom. Her calling as a\r\nslave had been that of a dress-maker and house servant. Mary Frances was\r\nabout twenty-three years of age, of mixed blood, refined in her manners\r\nand somewhat cultivated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEliza Henderson, who happened at the station at the same time that\r\nFrances was on hand, escaped from Richmond. She was twenty-eight years\r\nof age, medium size, quite dark color, and of pleasant countenance.\r\nEliza alleged that one William Waverton had been wronging her by keeping\r\nher down-trodden and withholding her hire. Also, that this same Waverton\r\nhad, on a late occasion, brought his heavy fist violently against her\r\n\"jaws,\" which visitation, however \"kindly\" intended by her chivalrous\r\nmaster, produced such an unfavorable impression on the mind of Eliza\r\nthat she at once determined not to yield submission to him a day longer\r\nthan she could find an Underground Rail Road conductor who would take\r\nher North.\r\n\r\nThe blow that she had thus received made her almost frantic; she had\r\nhowever thought seriously on the question of her rights before this\r\noutrage.\r\n\r\nIn Waverton's household Eliza had become a fixture as it were,\r\nespecially with regard to his children; she had won their affections\r\ncompletely, and she was under the impression that in some instances\r\ntheir influence had saved her from severe punishment; and for them she\r\nmanifested kindly feelings. In speaking of her mistress she said that\r\nshe was \"only tolerable.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be useless to attempt a description of the great satisfaction\r\nand delight evinced by Eliza on reaching the Committee in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nNancy Grantham also fled from near Richmond, and was fortunate in that\r\nshe escaped from the prison-house at the age of nineteen. She possessed\r\na countenance peculiarly mild, and was good-looking and interesting, and\r\nalthough evidently a slave her father belonged strictly to the white\r\nman's party, for she was fully half white. She was moved to escape\r\nsimply to shun her master's evil designs; his brutal purposes were only\r\nfrustrated by the utmost resolution. This chivalric gentleman was a\r\nhusband, the father of nine children, and the owner of three hundred\r\nslaves. He belonged to a family bearing the name of Christian, and was\r\nsaid to be an M.D. \"He was an old man, but very cruel to all his\r\nslaves.\" It was said that Nancy's sister was the object of his lust, but\r\nshe resisted, and the result was that she was sold to New Orleans. The\r\nauction-block was not the only punishment she was called upon to endure\r\nfor her fidelity to her womanhood, for resistance to her master, but\r\nbefore being sold she was cruelly scourged.\r\n\r\nNancy's sorrows first commenced in Alabama. Five years previous to her\r\nescape she was brought from a cotton plantation in Alabama, where she\r\nhad been accustomed to toil in the cotton-field. In comparing and\r\ncontrasting the usages of slave-holders in the two States in which she\r\nhad served, she said she had \"seen more flogging under old Christian\"\r\nthan she had been accustomed to see in Alabama; yet she concluded, that\r\nshe could hardly tell which State was the worst; her cup had been full\r\nand very bitter in both States.\r\n\r\nNancy said, \"the very day before I escaped, I was required to go to his\r\n(her master's) bed-chamber to keep the flies off of him as he lay sick,\r\nor pretended to be so. Notwithstanding, in talking with me, he said that\r\nhe was coming to my pallet that night, and with an oath he declared if I\r\nmade a noise he would cut my throat. I told him I would not be there.\r\nAccordingly he did go to my room, but I had gone for shelter to another\r\nroom. At this his wrath waxed terrible. Next morning I was called to\r\naccount for getting out of his way, and I was beaten awfully.\" This\r\noutrage moved Nancy to a death-struggle for her freedom, and she\r\nsucceeded by dressing herself in male attire.\r\n\r\nAfter her harrowing story was told with so much earnestness and\r\nintelligence, she was asked as to the treatment she had received at the\r\nhand of Mrs. Christian (her mistress). In relation to her, Nancy said,\r\n\"Mrs. Christian was afraid of him (master); if it hadn't been for that I\r\nthink she would have been clever; but I was often threatened by her, and\r\nonce she undertook to beat me, but I could not stand it. I had to\r\nresist, and she got the worst of it that time.\"\r\n\r\nAll that may now be added, is, that the number of young slave girls\r\nshamefully exposed to the base lusts of their masters, as Nancy\r\nwas--truly was legion. Nancy was but one of the number who resisted\r\ninfluences apparently overpowering. All honor is due her name and\r\nmemory!\r\n\r\nShe was brought away secreted on a boat, but the record is silent as to\r\nwhich one of the two or three Underground Rail Road captains (who at\r\nthat time occasionally brought passengers), helped her to escape. It was\r\nhard to be definite concerning minor matters while absorbed in the\r\npainful reflections that her tale of suffering had naturally awakened.\r\nIf one had arisen from the dead the horrors of Slavery could scarcely\r\nhave been more vividly pictured! But in the multitude of travelers\r\ncoming under the notice of the Committee, Nancy's story was soon\r\nforgotten, and new and marvellous narratives were told of others who had\r\nshared the same bitter cup, who had escaped from the same hell of\r\nSlavery, who had panted for the same freedom and won the same prize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM RICHMOND, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nORLANDO J. HUNT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Orlando escaped from Richmond the Underground Rail Road business\r\nwas not very brisk. A disaster on the road, resulting in the capture of\r\none or two captains, tended to damp the ardor of some who wanted to\r\ncome, as well as that of sympathizers. The road was not idle, however.\r\nOrlando's coming was hailed with great satisfaction. He was twenty-nine\r\nyears of age, full black, possessed considerable intelligence, and was\r\nfluent in speech; fully qualified to give clear statements as to the\r\ncondition of Slavery in Richmond, etc. While the Committee listened to\r\nhis narrations with much interest, they only took note of how he had\r\nfared, and the character of the master he was compelled to serve. On\r\nthese points the substance of his narrations may be found annexed:\r\n\r\n\"I was owned by High Holser, a hide sorter, a man said to be rich, a\r\ngood Catholic, though very disagreeable; he was not cruel, but was very\r\ndriving and abusive in his language towards colored people. I have been\r\nheld in bondage about eighteen years by Holser, but have failed, so far,\r\nto find any good traits in his character. I purchased my mother for one\r\nhundred dollars, when she was old and past labor, too old to earn her\r\nhire and find herself; but she was taken away by death, before I had\r\nfinished paying for her; twenty-five dollars only remained to be paid to\r\nfinish the agreement. Owing to her unexpected death, I got rid of that\r\nmuch, which was of some consequence, as I was a slave myself, and had\r\nhard work to raise the money to purchase her.\"\r\n\r\nThus, finding the usages of Slavery so cruel and outlandish, he resolved\r\nto leave \"old Virginny\" and \"took out,\" via the Underground Rail Road.\r\nHe appeared to be of a religious turn of mind and felt that he had \"a\r\ncall to preach.\"\r\n\r\nAfter his arrival in Canada, the following letter was received from him:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ST. CATHARINES, C.W., May 6th, 1858.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR FRIEND:--WM. STILL:--Mr. Orlando J. Hunt, who has just\r\n    arrived here from Richmond, Va., desires me to address to you a\r\n    line in his behalf. Mr. Hunt is expecting his clothing to come\r\n    from Richmond to your care, and if you have received them, he\r\n    desires you to forward them immediately to St. Catharines, in my\r\n    care, in the safest and most expeditious way in your power. Mr.\r\n    Hunt is much pleased with this land of freedom, and I hope he\r\n    may do well for himself and much good to others. He preached\r\n    here in the Baptist church, last evening.\r\n\r\n    He sends his kind regards and sincere thanks to you and your\r\n    family, and such friends as have favored him on his way. Very\r\n    respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n    HIRAM WILSON, for ORLANDO HUNT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM NORFOLK, VA., 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM MACKEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam made no complaint against his master of a serious nature\r\ntouching himself. True, he said his \"master was a frolicker, and fond of\r\ndrink,\" but he was not particularly unkind to him. His name was Tunis;\r\nhe was a military man, and young; consequently William had not been in\r\nhis hands long. Prior to his being owned by the young master, he had\r\nlived with old mistress Tunis. Concerning her the following is one of\r\nWilliam's statements:\r\n\r\n\"My sister about the first of this month, three weeks after her\r\nconfinement, had word sent to her by her mistress, Mrs. Tunis, that she\r\nthought it was time for her to come out and go to work, as she had been\r\nlaying by long enough.\" In reply to this message, William said that \"his\r\nsister sent word to her mistress, that she was not well enough, and\r\nbegged that her mistress would please send her some tea and sugar, until\r\nshe got well enough to go to work. The mistress' answer was to the\r\neffect that she did not intend to give her anything until she went to\r\nwork, and at the same time she sent word to her, that she had better\r\ntake her baby down to the back of the garden and throw it away, adding\r\n'I will sell her, etc.'\"\r\n\r\nIt was owing to the cruelty of Mrs. Tunis that William was moved to\r\nflee. According to his statement, which looked reasonable and appeared\r\ntruthful, he had been willed free by his master, who died at the time\r\nthat the plague was raging in Norfolk. At the same time his mistress\r\nalso had the fever, and was dreadfully frightened, but recovered. Not\r\nlong after this event it was William's belief that the will was made\r\naway with through the agency of a lawyer, and in consequence thereof the\r\nslaves were retained in bondage.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM NEAR BALTIMORE, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY TUCKER.\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry fled from Baltimore county; disagreement between him and his\r\nso-called master was the cause of his flight. Elias Sneveley, a farmer,\r\nknown on the Arabella Creek Place as a \"hard swearer,\" an \"old\r\nbachelor,\" and a common tormentor of all around him, was the name of the\r\nman that Harry said he fled from. Not willing to be run over at the\r\npleasure of Sneveley, on two occasions just before his escape serious\r\nencounters had arisen between master and slave.\r\n\r\nHenry being spirited and hungering for freedom, while his master was old\r\nand hardened in his habits, very grave results had well nigh happened;\r\nit was evident, therefore, in Harry's opinion that the sooner he took\r\nhis departure for Canada the better. His father's example was ever\r\npresent to encourage him, for he had escaped when Henry was a little\r\nboy; (his name was Benjamin Tucker). A still greater incentive, however,\r\nmoved him, which was that his mother had been sold South five years\r\nprior to his escape, since which time he had heard of her but once, and\r\nthat vaguely.\r\n\r\nAlthough education was denied him, Henry had too much natural ability to\r\ncontent himself under the heel of Slavery. He saw and understood the\r\nextent of the wrongs under which he suffered, and resolved not to abide\r\nin such a condition, if, by struggling and perseverance, he could avoid\r\nit. In his resolute attempt he succeeded without any very severe\r\nsuffering. He was not large, rather below the ordinary size, of a brown\r\ncolor, and very plucky.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM VIRGINIA, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nPETER NELSON. (RESEMBLED AN IRISHMAN.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coming of this strange-looking individual caused much surprise,\r\nrepresenting, as he did, if not a full-blooded Irishman, a man of Irish\r\ndescent. He was sufficiently fair to pass for white anywhere, with his\r\nhat on--with it off, his hair would have betrayed him; it was light, but\r\nquite woolly. Nor was he likely to be called handsome; he was\r\ninteresting, nevertheless. It was evident, that the \"white man's party\"\r\nhad damaged him seriously. He represented that he had been in the bonds\r\nof one James Ford, of Stafford county, Virginia, and that this \"Ford was\r\na right tough old fellow, who owned about two dozen head.\" \"How does he\r\ntreat them?\" he was asked. \"He don't treat them well no way,\" replied\r\nthe passenger. \"Why did you leave?\" was the next question. \"Because of\r\nhis fighting, knocking and carrying on so,\" was the prompt answer. The\r\nCommittee fully interviewed him, and perceived that he had really worn\r\nthe fetters of Slavery, and that he was justified in breaking his bonds\r\nand fleeing for refuge to Canada, and was entitled to aid and sympathy.\r\nPeter was about twenty-four years of age. He left nine brothers and\r\nsisters in bondage.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM WASHINGTON, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARY JONES AND SUSAN BELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese \"weaker vessels\" came from the seat of government. Mary confessed\r\nthat she had been held to service as the property of Mrs. Henry Harding,\r\nwho resided at Rockville, some miles out of Washington. Both Mr. and Mrs\r\nHarding she considered \"bad enough,\" but added, \"if it had not been for\r\nthe young set I could get along with them; they can't be pleased.\" Yet\r\nMary had not fared half so hard under the Hardings as many slaves had\r\nunder their claimants. Intellectually, she was quite above the average;\r\nshe was tall, and her appearance was such as to awaken sympathy. Through\r\nthe permission of her claimant she had been in the habit of hiring her\r\ntime for three dollars per month and find herself; she was also allowed\r\nto live in Washington. Such privileges, with wages at so low a rate,\r\nwere thought to be extra, and could only be obtained in exceptional\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n\"In nine years,\" said Mary, \"I have not even as much as received an\r\napron from them,\" (her owners). The meanness of the system under which\r\nshe had been required to live, hourly appeared clearer and clearer to\r\nher, as she was brought into contact with sympathizing spirits such as\r\nshe had never known before.\r\n\r\nSusan, who was in Mary's charge, was an invalid child of four years of\r\nage, who never walked, and whose mother had escaped to Canada about\r\nthree years before under circumstances which obliged her to leave this\r\nchild, then only a year old.\r\n\r\nSusan had been a great sufferer, and so had her mother, who had been a\r\nlong time anxiously looking and praying for her coming, as she had left\r\nher in charge of friends who were to take care of her until the way\r\nmight open for her safe delivery to her mother. Many letters, fitted to\r\nawaken very deep feelings came from the mother about this child. It was\r\na satisfaction to the Committee to feel that they could be the medium in\r\naiding in the reunion of mother and child.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM VIRGINIA, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM CARPENTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nEscaped from the Father of the Fugitive Slave Law--Senator Mason.\r\n\r\nIt was highly pleasing to have a visit from a \"chattel\" belonging to the\r\nleading advocate of the infamous Fugitive Slave Bill. He was hurriedly\r\ninterviewed for the sake of reliable information.\r\n\r\nThat William possessed a fair knowledge of slave life under the Senator\r\nthere was no room to doubt, although incidents of extreme cruelty might\r\nnot have been so common on Mason's place as on some others. While the\r\nverbal interchange of views was quite full, the hour for the starting of\r\nthe Underground Rail Road train arrived too soon to admit of a full\r\nreport for the record book. From the original record, however, the\r\nfollowing statement is taken as made by William, and believed to be\r\nstrictly true. We give it as it stands on the old Underground Rail Road\r\nbook: \"I belonged to Senator Mason. The Senator was down on colored\r\npeople. He owned about eighty head--was very rich and a big man, rich\r\nenough to lose all of them. He kept terrible overseers; they would beat\r\nyou with a stick the same as a dog. The overseers were poor white trash;\r\nhe would give them about sixty dollars a year.\"\r\n\r\nThe Fugitive Slave Law and its Father are both numbered with the \"Lost\r\nCause,\" and the \"Year of Jubilee has come.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM THE OLD DOMINION.\r\n\r\n\r\nNINE VERY FINE \"ARTICLES.\" LEW JONES, OSCAR PAYNE, MOSE WOOD, DAVE\r\nDIGGS, JACK, HEN, AND BILL DADE, AND JOE BALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coming of this interesting party was as gratifying, as their\r\ndeparture must have been disagreeable to those who had been enjoying the\r\nfruits of their unpaid labor. Stockholders of the Underground Rail Road,\r\nconductors, etc., about this time were well pleased with the wonderful\r\nsuccess of the road, especially as business was daily increasing.\r\n\r\nUpon inquiry of these passengers individually, the following results\r\nwere obtained:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLewis was about fifty-two years of age, a man of superior stature, six\r\nfeet high, with prominent features, and about one third of Anglo-Saxon\r\nblood in his veins. The apparent solidity of the man both with respect\r\nto body and mind was calculated to inspire the idea that he would be a\r\nfirst-rate man to manage a farm in Canada.\r\n\r\nOf his bondage and escape the following statement was obtained from him:\r\n\"I was owned by a man named Thomas Sydan, a Catholic, and a farmer. He\r\nwas not a very hard man, but was very much opposed to black folks having\r\ntheir liberty. He owned six young slaves not grown up. It was owing to\r\nSydan's mother's estate that I came into his hands; before her death I\r\nhad hoped to be free for a long time as soon as she died. My old\r\nmistress' name was Nancy Sydan; she was lame for twenty years, and\r\ncouldn't walk a step without crutches, and I was her main support. I was\r\nforeman on the farm; sometimes no body but me would work, and I was\r\nlooked up to for support. A good deal of the time I would have to attend\r\nto her. If she was going to ride, I would have to pick her up in my arms\r\nand put her in the carriage, and many times I would have to lift her in\r\nher sick room. No body couldn't wait upon her but me. She had a husband,\r\nand he had a master, and that was rum; he drank very hard, he killed\r\nhimself drinking. He was poor support. When he died, fifteen years ago,\r\nhe left three sons, Thomas, James, and Stephen, they were all together\r\nthen, only common livers. After his death about six years mistress died.\r\nI felt sure then I would be free, but was very badly disappointed. I\r\nwent to my young masters and asked them about my freedom; they laughed\r\nat me and said, no such thought had entered their heads, that I was to\r\nbe free. The neighbors said it was a shame that they should keep me out\r\nof my freedom, after I had been the making of the family, and had\r\nbehaved myself so faithful. One gentleman asked master John what he\r\nwould take for me, and offered a thousand dollars; that was three months\r\nbefore I ran away, and massa John said a thousand dollars wouldn't buy\r\none leg. I hadn't anything to hope for from them. I served them all my\r\nlife, and they didn't thank me for it. A short time before I come away\r\nmy aunt died, all the kin I had, and they wouldn't let me go to the\r\nfuneral. They said 'the time couldn't be spared.'\" This was the last\r\nstraw on the camel's back.\r\n\r\nIn Lewis' grief and disappointment he decided that he would run away the\r\nfirst chance that he could get, and seek a home in Canada. He held\r\ncounsel with others in whom he could confide, and they fixed on a time\r\nto start, and resolved that they would suffer anything else but Slavery.\r\nLewis was delighted that he had managed so cunningly to leave master Tom\r\nand mistress Margaret, and their six children to work for their own\r\nliving. He had an idea that they would want Lew for many things; the\r\nonly regret he felt was that he had served them so long, that they had\r\nreceived his substance and strength for half a century. Fortunately\r\nLewis' wife escaped three days in advance of him, in accordance with a\r\nmutual understanding. They had no children. The suffering on the road\r\ncost Lewis a little less than death, but the joy of success came soon to\r\nchase away the effects of the pain and hardship which had been endured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOscar, the next passenger, was advertised as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    $200 REWARD.--Ran away from the service of the Rev. J.P.\r\n    McGuire, Episcopal High School, Fairfax county, Va., on\r\n    Saturday, 10th inst, Negro Man, Oscar Payne aged 30 years, 5\r\n    feet 4 inches in height, square built, mulatto color, thick,\r\n    bushy suit of hair, round, full face, and when spoken to has a\r\n    pleasant manner--clothes not recollected.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    I will give $200 for his recovery if taken out of the State, or\r\n    $150 if taken in the State, and secured that I can get him.\r\n\r\n    T.D. FENDALL.\r\n\r\n    jyl7-6t.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch announcements never frightened the Underground Rail Road Committee;\r\nindeed, the Committee rather preferred seeing the names of their\r\npassengers in the papers, as, in that case, they could all the more\r\ncautiously provide against Messrs. slave-hunters. Oscar was a \"prime,\r\nfirst-class article,\" worth $1800. The above description of him is\r\nendorsed. His story ran thus:\r\n\r\n\"I have served under Miss Mary Dade, of Alexandria--Miss Dade was a very\r\nclever mistress, she hired me out. When I left I was hired at the\r\nschool--High School of Virginia. With me times had been very well. No\r\nprivilege was allowed me to study books. I cannot say that I left for\r\nany other cause than to get my freedom, as I believe I have been used as\r\nwell as any slave in the District. I left no relatives but two cousins;\r\nmy two brothers ran away, Brooks and Lawrence, but where they went I\r\ncan't tell, but would be pleased to know. Three brothers and one sister\r\nhave been sold South, can't tell where they are.\" Such was Oscar's brief\r\nnarrative; that he was truthful there was no room to doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next passenger was MOSES or \"Mose,\" who looked as though he had been\r\nexceedingly well-cared for, being plump, fat, and extra-smart. He\r\ndeclared that General Briscoe, of Georgetown, D.C., had been defrauding\r\nhim out of thirteen dollars per month, this being the amount for which\r\nhe was hired, and, instead of being allowed to draw it for himself, the\r\ngeneral pocketed it. For this \"kind treatment\" he summed up what seemed\r\nto be a true bill for ten years against the general. But he made another\r\ncharge of a still graver character: he said that the general professed\r\nto own him. But as he (Moses) was thoroughly tired, and believed that\r\nSlavery was no more justifiable than murder, he made up his mind to\r\nleave and join the union party for Canada. He stated that the general\r\nowned a large number of slaves, which he hired out principally. Moses\r\nhad no special fault to find with his master, except such as have been\r\nalluded to, but as to mistress Briscoe, he said, that she was pretty\r\nrough. Moses left four sisters in bondage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid, the next member of this freedom-loving band, was an intelligent\r\nman; his manners and movements were decidedly prepossessing. He was\r\nabout thirty-seven years of age, dark, tall, and rather of a slender\r\nstature, possessing very large hopes. He charged Dr. Josiah Harding of\r\nRockville, Montgomery county, with having enslaved him contrary to his\r\nwish or will.\r\n\r\nAs a slave, David had been required at one time to work on a farm, and\r\nat another time to drive carriage, of course, without pay. Again he had\r\nbeen bound as a waiter on the no pay system, and again he had been\r\ncalled into the kitchen to cook, all for the benefit of the Doctor--the\r\nhire going into the Dr.'s pocket. This business David protested against\r\nin secret, but when on the Underground Rail Road his protestations were\r\n\"over and above board.\"\r\n\r\nOf the Doctor, David said, that \"he was clever, but a Catholic;\" he also\r\nsaid, that he thought his wife was \"tolerable clever,\" although he had\r\nnever been placed under her where he would have had an opportunity of\r\nlearning her bad traits if she had any.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor had generously bargained with David, that he could have\r\nhimself by paying $1000; he had likewise figured up how the money might\r\nbe paid, and intimated what a nice thing it would be for \"Dave\" to wake\r\nup some morning and find himself his own man. This was how it was to be\r\naccomplished: Dave was to pay eighty-five dollars annually, and in about\r\ntwelve years he would have the thousand, and a little over, all made up.\r\nOn this principle and suggestion Dave had been digging faithfully and\r\nhard, and with the aid of friends he had nearly succeeded. Just when he\r\nwas within sight of the grand prize, and just as the last payment was\r\nabout to be made, to Dave's utter surprise the Doctor got very angry one\r\nday about some trifling matter (all pretension) and in his pretended\r\nrage he said there were too many \"free niggers\" going about, and he\r\nthought that Dave would do better as a slave, etc.\r\n\r\nAfter that, all the satisfaction that he was able to get out of the\r\nDoctor, was simply to the effect, that he had hired him to Mr. Morrison\r\nfor one hundred and fifty dollars a year. After his \"lying and cheating\"\r\nin this way, David resolved that he would take his chances on the\r\nUnderground Rail Road. Not a spark of faith did he have in the Doctor.\r\nFor a time, however, before the opportunity to escape offered, he went\r\nto Mr. Morrison as a waiter, where it was his province to wait on six of\r\nthe Judges of the Supreme Court of the United States. In the meantime\r\nhis party matured arrangements for their trip, so Dave \"took out\" and\r\nleft the Judges without a waiter. The more he reflected over the nature\r\nof the wrongs he had suffered under, the less he thought of the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoe, who also came with this band, was half Anglo-Saxon; an able-bodied\r\nman, thirty-four years of age. He said, that \"Miss Elizabeth Gordon, a\r\nwhite woman living in Alexandria,\" claimed him. He did not find much\r\nfault with her. She permitted him to hire his time, find his own\r\nclothing, etc., by which regulation Joe got along smoothly. Nevertheless\r\nhe declared, that he was tired of wearing the yoke, and felt constrained\r\nto throw it off as soon as possible. Miss Gordon was getting old, and\r\nJoe noticed that the young tribe of nephews and nieces was multiplying\r\nin large numbers. This he regarded as a very bad sign; he therefore,\r\ngave the matter of the Underground Rail Road his serious attention, and\r\nit was not long ere he was fully persuaded that it would be wisdom for\r\nhim to tarry no longer in the prison-house. Joe had a wife and four\r\nchildren, which were as heavy weights to hold him in Virginia, but the\r\nspirit of liberty prevailed. Joe, also, left two sisters, one free, the\r\nother a slave. His wife belonged to the widow Irwin. She had assured her\r\nslaves, that she had \"provided for them in her will,\" and that at her\r\ndeath all would be freed. They were daily living on the faith thus\r\ncreated, and obviously thought the sooner the Lord relieved the old\r\nmistress of her earthly troubles the better.\r\n\r\nAlthough Joe left his wife and children, he did not forget them, but had\r\nstrong faith they would be reunited. After going to Canada, he addressed\r\nseveral letters to the Secretary of the Committee concerning his family,\r\nand as will be seen by the following, he looked with ardent hopes for\r\ntheir arrival:\r\n\r\n\r\n    TORONTO, Nov. 7th, 1857.\r\n\r\n    DEAR MR. STILL:--As I must again send you a letter fealing\r\n    myself oblidge to you for all you have done and your kindness.\r\n    Dear Sir my wife will be on to Philadelphia on the 8th 7th, and\r\n    I would you to look out for her and get her an ticket and send\r\n    her to me Toronto. Her name are May Ball with five children.\r\n    Please send her as soon as you can.\r\n\r\n    Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n    JOSEPH BALL.\r\n\r\n    Will you please to telegrape to me, No. 31 Dummer st.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJake, another member of the company of nine, was twenty-two years of\r\nage, of dark hue, round-made, keen eyes, and apparently a man of\r\nsuperior intelligence. Unfortunately his lot had been of such a nature\r\nthat no helping opportunity had been afforded for the cultivation of his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nHe condemned in very strong terms a man by the name of Benjamin B.\r\nChambers, who lived near Elkton, but did not there require the services\r\nof Jake, hiring Jake out just as he would have hired a horse, and\r\nlikewise keeping his pay. Jake thought that if justice could have been\r\nawarded him, Chambers would either have had to restore that of which he\r\nhad wronged him, or expiate the wrong in prison.\r\n\r\nJake, however, stood more in awe of a young master, who was soon likely\r\nto come into power, than he did of the old master. This son had already\r\ngiven Jake to understand that once in his hands it \"wouldn't be long\r\nbefore he would have him jingling in his pocket,\" signifying, that he\r\nwould sell him as soon as his father was gone.\r\n\r\nThe manner of the son stirred Jake's very blood to boiling heat it\r\nseemed. His suffering, and the suffering of his fellow-bondsmen had\r\nnever before appeared so hard. The idea that he must work, and be sold\r\nat the pleasure of another, made him decide to \"pull up stakes,\" and\r\nseek refuge elsewhere. Such a spirit as he possessed could not rest in\r\nservitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMary Ann, the wife of Jake, who accompanied him, was a pleasant-looking\r\nbride. She said that she was owned by \"Elias Rhoads, a farmer, and a\r\npretty fair kind of a man.\" She had been treated very well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn and Henry Dade, ages twenty and twenty-five years, were from\r\nWashington. They belonged to the class of well-cared for slaves; at\r\nleast they said that their mistress had not dealt severely with them,\r\nand they never would have consented to pass through the severe\r\nsufferings encountered on their journey, but for the strong desire they\r\nhad to be free. From Canada John wrote back as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ST. CATHARINES, Canada.\r\n\r\n    MR.

He was of\r\nunmixed blood, medium size and of humble appearance. He was destitute of\r\nthe knowledge of spelling, to say nothing of reading. Slavery had\r\nstamped him unmistakably for life. To be scantily fed and clothed, and\r\ncompelled to work without hire, George did not admire, but had to submit\r\nwithout murmuring; indeed, he knew that his so-called master, whose name\r\nwas Denny, would not be likely to hear complaints from a slave; he\r\ntherefore dragged his chain and yielded to his daily task.\r\n\r\nOne day, while hauling dirt with a fractious horse, the animal\r\nmanifested an unwillingness to perform his duty satisfactorily. At this\r\nprocedure the master charged George with provoking the beast to do\r\nwickedly, and in a rage he collared George and bade him accompany him\r\n\"up stairs\" (of the soap house). Not daring to resist, George went along\r\nwith him. Ropes being tied around both his wrists, the block and tackle\r\nwere fastened thereto, and George soon found himself hoisted on tip-toe\r\nwith his feet almost clear of the floor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nThe \"kind-hearted master\" then tore all the poor fellow's old shirt off\r\nhis back, and addressed him thus: \"You son of a b----h, I will give you\r\npouting around me; stay there till I go up town for my cowhide.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge begged piteously, but in vain. The fracas caused some excitement,\r\nand it so happened that a show was to be exhibited that day in the town,\r\nwhich, as is usual in the country, brought a great many people from a\r\ndistance; so, to his surprise, when the master returned with his\r\ncowhide, he found that a large number of curiosity-seekers had been\r\nattracted to the soap house to see Mr. Denny perform with his cowhide on\r\nGeorge's back, as he was stretched up by his hands. Many had evidently\r\nmade up their minds that it would be more amusing to see the cowhiding\r\nthan the circus.\r\n\r\nThe spectators numbered about three hundred. This was a larger number\r\nthan Mr. Denny had been accustomed to perform before, consequently he\r\nwas seized with embarrassment; looking confused he left the soap house\r\nand went to his office, to await the dispersion of the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe throng finally retired, and left George hanging in mortal agony.\r\nHuman nature here made a death-struggle; the cords which bound his\r\nwrists were unloosed, and George was then prepared to strike for freedom\r\nat the mouth of the cannon or point of the bayonet. How Denny regarded\r\nthe matter when he found that George had not only cheated him out of the\r\nanticipated delight of cowhiding him, but had also cheated him out of\r\nhimself is left for the imagination to picture.\r\n\r\nGeorge fled from Kent; he was accompanied by a comrade whose name\r\ninadvertently was not recorded; he, however, was described as a dark,\r\nround, and full-faced, stout-built man, with bow legs, and bore the\r\nappearance of having been used hard and kept down, and in ignorance, &c.\r\nHard usage constrained him to flee from his sore oppression.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM DELAWARE, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN WEEMS, ALIAS JACK HERRING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Jack was but twenty-three years of age, he had tasted the\r\nbitter cup of Slavery pretty thoroughly under Kendall B. Herring, who\r\nwas a member of the Methodist Church, and in Jack's opinion a \"mere\r\npretender, and a man of a very bad disposition.\" Jack thought that he\r\nhad worked full long enough for this Herring for nothing. When a boy\r\ntwelve years of age, his mother was sold South; from that day, until the\r\nhour that he fled he had not heard a word from her. In making up his\r\nmind to leave Slavery, the outrage inflicted upon his mother only tended\r\nto increase his resolution.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of his mistress, he said that \"she was a right fine woman.\"\r\nNotwithstanding all his sufferings in the Kendall family, he seemed\r\nwilling to do justice to his master and mistress individually. He left\r\none sister free and one brother in the hands of Herring. Jack was\r\ndescribed as a man of dark color, stout, and well-made.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND, 1858.\r\n\r\nRUTH HARPER, GEORGE ROBINSON, PRISCILLA GARDENER, AND JOSHUA JOHN\r\nANDERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRuthie's course in seeking her freedom left John McPherson a woman less\r\nto work for him, and to whip, sell, or degrade at his pleasure. It is\r\ndue to candor, however, to say that she admitted that she had not been\r\nused very roughly by Mr. McPherson. Ruth was rather a nice-looking young\r\nwoman, tall, and polite in her manners. She came from Frederick,\r\nMaryland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Robinson stated that he came from a place about one and a half\r\nmiles from the Chesapeake Bay, one mile from Old town, and five miles\r\nfrom Elkton, and was owned by Samuel Smith, a farmer, who was \"pretty\r\ncross and an ill man.\" George's excuse for withdrawing his valuable\r\nservices from Mr. Smith at the time that he did, was attributable to the\r\nfact, that he entertained fears that they were about to sell him. Having\r\ncautiousness largely developed he determined to reach Canada and keep\r\nout of danger. George was only twenty-one, passable-looking in\r\nappearance, and of a brown color, and when speaking, stammered\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPriscilla Gardener fled from the widow Hilliard. Her master departed to\r\nhis long home not a great while before she left. Priscilla was a young\r\nwoman of about thirty years of age, ordinary size, and of a ginger-bread\r\ncolor; modest in demeanor. She first commenced her bondage in Richmond,\r\nunder the late Benjamin Hilliard, of whom she said that he was \"a very\r\nbad man, who could never be pleased by a servant,\" and was constantly\r\naddicted to fighting not only with others, but also with herself. So\r\ncruelly had Priscilla been treated, that when he died she did not\r\nhesitate to say that she was glad. Soon after this event, sick of\r\nSlavery and unwilling to serve the widow any longer, she determined to\r\nescape, and succeeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoshua John  Anderson fled from a farmer who was said to be a poor man,\r\nby the name of Skelton Price, residing in Baltimore county, near a\r\nlittle village called Alexandria, on the Harford county turn-pike road.\r\nPrice, not able to own a farm and slaves too, rented one, and was trying\r\nto \"get up in the world.\" Price had a wife and family, but in the way of\r\ntreatment, Joshua did not say anything very hard against him. As his\r\nexcuse for leaving them, he said, coolly, that he had made up his mind\r\nthat he could get along better in freedom than he could in Slavery, and\r\nthat no man had a right to his labor without paying him for it. He left\r\nhis mother and also three brothers and two sisters owned by Price.\r\nJoshua was about twenty-two years of age, of a coarse make, and a dark\r\nhue; he had evidently held but little intercourse with any class, save\r\nsuch as he found in the corn-field and barn-yard.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM NORTH CAROLINA AND DELAWARE.\r\n\r\n\"DICK BEESLY\",MURRAY YOUNG AND CHARLES ANDREW BOLDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysically, Dick was hardly up to the ordinary stature of slaves, but\r\nmentally he had the advantage of the masses; he was too sharp to be kept\r\nin Slavery. His hue was perfect, no sign of white about him, if that\r\nwere any advantage.\r\n\r\nFrom Dick's story, it appeared that he had seen hard times in North\r\nCarolina, under a man he designated by the name of Richard Smallwood. He\r\nwas a farmer, living near Wheldon. One of the faults that he found with\r\nSmallwood was, that he was a \"tough, drinking man\"--he also charged him\r\nwith holding \"two hundred and sixty slaves in bonds,\" the most of whom\r\nhe came in possession of through his wife. \"She,\" Dick thought \"was\r\npretty fair.\" He said that no slave had any reason to look for any other\r\nthan hard times under his master, according to what he had seen and\r\nknown since he had been in the \"institution,\" and he fancied that his\r\nchances for observation had been equally as good as the great majority\r\nof slaves. Young as he was, Dick had been sold three times already, and\r\ndidn't know how much oftener he might have to submit to the same fate if\r\nhe remained; so, in order to avoid further trouble, he applied his\r\nentire skill to the grand idea of making his way to Canada.\r\n\r\nManfully did he wrestle with difficulty after difficulty, until he\r\nfinally happily triumphed and reached Philadelphia in a good\r\ncondition--that is, he was not sick, but he was without\r\nmoney--home--education or friends, except as he found them among\r\nstrangers. He was hopeful, nevertheless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMurray Young was also of the unmixed-blood class, and only twenty-one\r\nyears of age. The spirit of liberty in him was pretty largely developed.\r\nHe entertained naught against Dr. Lober, of Newcastle, but rather\r\nagainst the Doctor's wife. He said that he could get along pretty well\r\nwith the Doctor, but, he could not get along with Mrs. Lober. But the\r\nvery idea of Slavery was enough for him. He did not mean to work for any\r\nbody for nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew Bolden was still younger than Charles Murray, being only eighteen\r\nyears of age, but he was very well grown, and on the auction-block he\r\nwould, doubtless, have brought a large price. He fled from Newark. His\r\nstory contained nothing of marked importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND.\r\n\r\nJOHN JANNEY, TALBOT JOHNSON, SAM GROSS, PETER GROSS, JAMES HENRY\r\nJACKSON, AND SAM SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    $1.000 REWARD.--Ran away from the subscriber, August 14th, two\r\n    negro men, viz:\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    BILL HUTTON,\r\n\r\n    aged 48 or 50 years, dark brown, round face, 5 feet 7 or 8\r\n    inches high, rather stout, has a waddling walk, and small bald\r\n    spot on the top of his head.\r\n\r\n    TALBOT JOHNSON,\r\n\r\n    aged about 35, is black, spare, and lean-visaged, about 5 feet\r\n    10 inches high, has lost some of his front teeth, leans forward\r\n    as he walks.\r\n\r\n    If taken in a slave State I will give $200 each for their\r\n    recovery.

He says that he fled from master Joseph Griffiss of\r\n    Culbert county, Maryland; that he has been used to \"tight work,\"\r\n    \"allowed no chances,\" and but \"half fed.\" His reason for leaving\r\n    was partly \"hard treatment,\" and partly because he could \"get\r\n    along better in freedom than in slavery.\" He found fault with\r\n    his master for not permitting him to \"learn to read,\" etc. He\r\n    referred to his master as a man of \"fifty years of age, with a\r\n    wife and three children.\" John said that \"she was a large,\r\n    portly woman, with an evil disposition, always wanted to be\r\n    quarreling and fighting, and was stingy.\" He said, however, that\r\n    his \"master's children, Ann Rebecca, Dorcas, and Joe were not\r\n    allowed to meddle with the slaves on the farm.\" Thirty head of\r\n    slaves belonged on the place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Peter Gross says that he too was owned by Joseph Griffiss. Peter\r\n    is, he thinks, thirty-nine years of age,--tall, of a dark\r\n    chestnut color, and in intellect mediocre. He left his wife and\r\n    five children behind. He could not bring them with him,\r\n    therefore he did not tell them that he was about to leave. He\r\n    was much dissatisfied with Slavery and felt that he had been\r\n    badly dealt with, and that he could do better for himself in\r\n    Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Talbot Johnson, is thirty-five years of age, quite dark, and\r\n    substantially built. He says that he has been treated very\r\n    badly, and that Duke Bond was the name of the \"tyrant\" who held\r\n    him. He pictured his master as \"a lean-faced man--not stout--of\r\n    thirty-eight or thirty-nine years of age, a member of the\r\n    Episcopal Church.\" \"He had a wife and two children; his last\r\n    wife was right pleasant--he was a farmer, and was rich, had sold\r\n    slaves, and was severe when he flogged.\" Talbot had been\r\n    promised a terrible beating on the return of his master from the\r\n    Springs, whither he had gone to recruit his health, \"as he was\r\n    poorly.\" This was the sole cause of Talbot's flight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sam Gross is about forty, a man of apparent vigor physically,\r\n    and wide awake mentally. He confesses that he fled from George\r\n    Island, near Port Republic, Md. He thought that times with him\r\n    had been bad enough all his life, and he would try to get away\r\n    where he could do better. In referring to his master and\r\n    mistress, he says that \"they are both Episcopalians, hard to\r\n    please, and had as bad dispositions as could be,--would try to\r\n    knock the slaves in the head sometimes.\" This spirit Sam\r\n    condemned in strong terms, and averred that it was on account of\r\n    such treatment that he was moved to seek out the Underground\r\n    Rail Road. Sam left his wife, Mary Ann, and four children, all\r\n    under bonds. His children, he said, were treated horribly. They\r\n    were owned by Joseph Griffiss spoken of above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    James Henry Jackson is seventeen years of age; he testifies that\r\n    he fled from Frederica, Delaware, where he had been owned by\r\n    Joseph Brown. Jim does not make any serious complaint against\r\n    his master, except that he had him in the market for sale. To\r\n    avert this fate, Jim was moved to flee. His mother, Ann Jackson,\r\n    lived nine miles from Milford, and was owned by Jim Loflin, and\r\n    lived on his place. Of the going of her son she had no\r\n    knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese narratives have been copied from the book as they were hastily\r\nrecorded at the time. During their sojourn at the station, the subjoined\r\nletter came to hand from Thomas Garrett, which may have caused anxiety\r\nand haste:\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILMINGTON, 9th mo. 6th, 1858.\r\n\r\n    ESTEEMED FRIENDS, J.M. McKIM AND WM. STILL:--I have a mixture of\r\n    good and bad news for you. Good in having passed five of God's\r\n    poor safely to Jersey, and Chester county, last week; and this\r\n    day sent on four more, that have caused me much anxiety. They\r\n    were within twenty miles of here on sixth day last, and by\r\n    agreement I had a man out all seventh day night watching for\r\n    them, to pilot them safely, as 1,000 dollars reward was offered\r\n    for four of the five; and I went several miles yesterday in the\r\n    country to try to learn what had become of them, but could not\r\n    hear of them. A man of tried integrity just called to say that\r\n    they arrived at his house last night, about midnight, and I\r\n    employed him to pilot them to a place of safety in Pennsylvania,\r\n    to-night, after which I trust they will be out of reach of their\r\n    pursuers. Now for the bad news. That old scoundrel, who applied\r\n    to me some three weeks since, pretending that he wished me to\r\n    assist him in getting his seven slaves into a free state, to\r\n    avoid the sheriff, and which I agreed to do, if he would bring\r\n    them here; but positively refused to send for them. Ten days\r\n    since I received another letter from him, saying that the\r\n    sheriff had been there, and taken away two of the children,\r\n    which he wished me to raise money to purchase and set free, and\r\n    then closed by saying that his other slaves, a man, his wife,\r\n    and three children had left the same evening and he had no doubt\r\n    I would find them at a colored man's house, he named, here, and\r\n    wished me to ascertain at once and let him know. I at once was\r\n    convinced he wished to know so as to have them arrested and\r\n    taken back. I found the man had arrived; but the woman and\r\n    children had given out, and he left them with a colored family\r\n    in Cecil. I wrote him word the family had not got here, but said\r\n    nothing of the man being here. On seventh day evening I saw a\r\n    colored woman from the neighborhood; she told me that the owner\r\n    and sheriff were out hunting five days for them before they\r\n    found them, and says there is not a greater hypocrite in that\r\n    part of the world. I wrote him a letter yesterday letting him\r\n    know just what I thought of him.\r\n\r\n    Your Friend,\r\n\r\n    THOS. GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRTH-DAY PRESENT FROM THOMAS GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILMINGTON, 8th mo. 21st, 1858.\r\n\r\n    ESTEEMED FRIEND:--WILLIAM STILL:--This is my 69th birth-day, and\r\n    I do not know any better way to celebrate it in a way to accord\r\n    with my feelings, than to send to thee two fugitives, man and\r\n    wife; the man has been here a week waiting for his wife, who is\r\n    expected in time to leave at 9 this evening in the cars for thy\r\n    house with a pilot, who knows where thee lives, but I cannot\r\n    help but feel some anxiety about the woman, as there is great\r\n    commotion just now in the neighborhood where she resides. There\r\n    were 4 slaves betrayed near the Maryland line by a colored man\r\n    named Jesse Perry a few nights since. One of them made a\r\n    confidant of him, and he agreed to pilot them on their way, and\r\n    had several white men secreted to take them as soon as they got\r\n    in his house; he is the scoundrel that was to have charge of the\r\n    7 I wrote you about two weeks since; their master was to take or\r\n    send them there, and he wanted me to send for them. I have since\r\n    been confirmed it was a trap set to catch one of our colored men\r\n    and me likewise, but it was no go. I suspected him from the\r\n    first, but afterwards was fully confirmed in my suspicions. We\r\n    have found the two Rust boys, John and Elsey Bradley, who the\r\n    villain of a Bust took out of jail and sold to a trader of the\r\n    name of Morris, who sold them to a trader who took them to\r\n    Richmond, Virginia, where they were sold at public sale two days\r\n    before we found them, for $2600, but fortunately the man had not\r\n    paid for them; our Attorney had them by habeas corpus before a\r\n    Judge, who detained them till we can prove their identity and\r\n    freedom; they are to have a hearing on 2d day next, when we hope\r\n    to have a person on there to prove them. In haste, thine,\r\n\r\n    THOS. GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately all the notice that the record contains of the two\r\npassengers referred to, is in the following words: \"Two cases not\r\nwritten out for want of time.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"boys\" alluded to as having been \"found\" &c., were free-born, but\r\nhad been kidnapped and carried south and sold.\r\n\r\nThree days after the above letter, the watchful Garrett furnished\r\nfurther light touching the hair-breadth escape of the two that he had\r\nwritten about, and at the same time gave an interesting account of the\r\nefforts which were made to save the poor kidnapped boys, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND LETTER FROM THOMAS GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILMINGTON, 8th mo. 25th, 1858.\r\n\r\n    ESTEEMED FRIEND:--WILLIAM STILL:--Thine was received yesterday.\r\n    Those two I wrote about to be with thee last 7th day evening, I\r\n    presume thee has seen before this. A. Allen had charge of them;\r\n    he had them kept out of sight at the depot here till the cars\r\n    should be ready to start, in charge of a friend, while he kept a\r\n    lookout and got a ticket. When the Delaware cars arrived, who\r\n    should step out but the master of both man and woman, (as they\r\n    had belonged to different persons); they knew him, and he knew\r\n    them. He left in a different direction from where they were\r\n    secreted, and got round to them and hurried them off to a place\r\n    of safety, as he was afraid to take them home for fear they\r\n    would search the house. On 1st day morning the boat ran to\r\n    Chester to take our colored people to the camp at Media; he had\r\n    them disguised, and got them in the crowd and went with them;\r\n    when he got to Media, he placed them in care of a colored man,\r\n    who promised to hand them over to thee on 2d day last; we expect\r\n    3 more next 7th day night, but how we shall dispose of them we\r\n    have not yet determined; it will depend on circumstances. Judge\r\n    Layton has been on with a friend to Richmond, Virginia, and\r\n    fully identified the two Bradley boys that were kidnapped by\r\n    Clem Rust. He has the assurance of the Judge there that they\r\n    will be tried and their case decided by Delaware Laws, by which\r\n    they must be declared free and returned here. We hope to be able\r\n    to bring such proof against both Rust and the man he sold them\r\n    to, who took them out of the State, to teach them a lesson they\r\n    will remember.\r\n\r\n    Thy friend,\r\n\r\n    THOS. GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, 1858.\r\n\r\nREBECCA JACKSON AND DAUGHTER, AND ROBERT SHORTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe road to Washington was doing about this time a marvellously large\r\nbusiness. \"William Penn\" and other friends in Washington were most\r\nvigilant, and knew where to find passengers who were daily thirsting for\r\ndeliverance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRebecca Jackson was a woman of about thirty-seven years of age, of a\r\nyellow color, and of bright intellect, prepossessing in her manners. She\r\nhad pined in bondage in Georgetown under Mrs. Margaret Dick, a lady of\r\nwealth and far advanced in life, a firm believer in slavery and the\r\nPresbyterian Church, of which she was a member.\r\n\r\nRebecca had been her chief attendant, knew all her whims and ways to\r\nperfection. According to Rebecca's idea, \"she was a peevish, fretful,\r\nill-natured, but kind-hearted creature.\" Being very tired of her old\r\nmistress and heartily sick of bondage, and withal desiring to save her\r\ndaughter, she ascertained the doings of the Underground Rail Road,--was\r\ntold about Canada, &c. She therefore resolved to make a bold adventure.\r\nMrs. Dick had resided a long time in Georgetown, but owned three large\r\nplantations in the country, over which she kept three overseers to look\r\nafter the slaves. Rebecca had a free husband, but she was not free to\r\nserve him, as she had to be digging day and night for the \"white\r\npeople.\" Robert, a son of the mistress lived with his mother. While\r\nRebecca regarded him as \"a man with a very evil disposition,\" she\r\nnevertheless believed that he had \"sense enough to see that the present\r\ngeneration of slaves would not bear so much as slaves had been made to\r\nbear the generation past.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM HONEY BROOK TOWNSHIP, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANK CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank was a man of blunt features, rather stout, almost jet black, and\r\nabout medium height and weight. He was not certain about his age, rather\r\nthought that he was between thirty and forty years. He had been deprived\r\nof learning to read or write, but with hard treatment he had been made\r\nfully acquainted under a man named Henry Campbell, who called himself\r\nFrank's master, and without his consent managed to profit by his daily\r\nsweat and toil. This Campbell was a farmer, and was said to be the owner\r\nof about one hundred head of slaves, besides having large investments in\r\nother directions. He did not hesitate to sell slaves if he could get his\r\nprice. Every now and then one and another would find it his turn to be\r\nsold. Frank resolved to try and get out of danger before times were\r\nworse. So he struck out resolutely for freedom and succeeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM ALEXANDRIA, VA., 1858.\r\n\r\nRICHARD BAYNE, CARTER DOWLING AND BENJAMIN TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard stated that a man named \"Rudolph Massey, a merchant tailor, hard\r\nrum-drinker, card player, etc.\" claimed to own him, and had held him, up\r\nto the time of his escape, as with bands of brass.\r\n\r\nRichard said, \"I was hired out for ten dollars a month, but I never\r\nsuffered like many--didn't leave because I have been abused, but simply\r\nto keep from falling into the hands of some heirs that I had been willed\r\nto.\" In case of a division, Richard did not see how he could be divided\r\nwithout being converted into money. Now, as he could have no\r\nfore-knowledge as to the place or person into whose hands he might be\r\nconsigned by the auctioneer, he concluded that he could not venture to\r\nrisk himself in the hands of the young heirs. Richard began to consider\r\nwhat Slavery was, and his eyes beheld chains, whips, hand-cuffs,\r\nauction-blocks, separations and countless sufferings that had partially\r\nbeen overlooked before; he felt the injustice of having to toil hard to\r\nsupport a drunkard and gambler. At the age of twenty-three Richard\r\nconcluded to \"lay down the shovel and the hoe,\" and look out for\r\nhimself. His mother was owned by Massey, but his father belonged to the\r\n\"superior race\" or claimed so to do, and if anything could be proved by\r\nappearances it was evident that he was the son of a white man. Richard\r\nwas endowed with a good share of intelligence. He not only left his\r\nmother but also one sister to clank their chains together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCarter, who accompanied Richard, had just reached his majority. He\r\nstated that he escaped from a \"maiden lady\" living in Alexandria, known\r\nby the name of Miss Maria Fitchhugh, the owner of twenty-five slaves.\r\nOpposed to Slavery as he was, he nevertheless found no fault with his\r\nmistress, but on the contrary, said that she was a very respectable\r\nlady, and a member of the Episcopal Church. She often spoke of freeing\r\nher servants when she died; such talk was too uncertain for Carter, to\r\npin his faith to, and he resolved not to wait. Such slave-holders\r\ngenerally lived a great while, and when they did die, they many times\r\nfailed to keep their promises. He concluded to heed the voice of reason,\r\nand at once leave the house of bondage. His mother, father, five\r\nbrothers and six sisters all owned by Miss Fitchhugh, formed a strong\r\ntie to keep him from going; he \"conferred not with flesh and blood,\" but\r\nmade a determined stroke for freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBenjamin, the third in this company, was only twenty years of age, but a\r\nbetter-looking specimen for the auction-block could hardly be found. He\r\nfled from the Meed estate; his mistress had recently died leaving her\r\naffairs, including the disposal of the slaves, to be settled at an early\r\ndate. He spoke of his mistress as \"a very clever lady to her servants,\"\r\nbut since her death he had realized the danger that he was in of being\r\nrun off south with a coffle gang. He explained the course frequently\r\nresorted to by slave-holders under similar circumstances thus:\r\n\"frequently slaves would be snatched up, hand cuffed and hurried off\r\nsouth on the night train without an hour's notice.\" Fearing that this\r\nmight be his fate, he deemed it prudent to take a northern train via the\r\nUnderground Rail Road without giving any notice.\r\n\r\nHe left no parents living, but six brothers and four sisters, all slaves\r\nwith the exception of one brother who had bought himself. In order to\r\ndefend themselves if molested on the road, the boys had provided\r\nthemselves with pistols and dirks, and declared that they were fully\r\nbent on using them rather than be carried back to slavery.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nHANSON WILLIAMS, NACE SHAW, GUSTA YOUNG, AND DANIEL M'NORTON SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    $200 REWARD.--Ran away from the subscriber, (Levi Pumphrey,) two\r\n    NEGRO MEN--one, named \"Hanson,\" about forty years old, with one\r\n    eye out, about 5 feet 4 inches in height, full, bushy hair and\r\n    whiskers and copper color. \"Gusta\" is about 21 years or 22 years\r\n    of age, smooth face and thick lips, and stoops in his walk;\r\n    black color, about 5 feet 5 or 6 inches in height; took away\r\n    sundry articles of clothing.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    I will give one hundred dollars for each of them, if secured in\r\n    jail so that I can get them.\r\n\r\n    LEVI PUMPHREY,\r\n\r\n    Washington City, D.C.\r\n\r\n    s14-6t.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese four fugitives were full of enthusiasm for Canada, although by no\r\nmeans among the worst abused of their class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHanson was about forty years of age, with apparently a good degree of\r\nintellect, and of staid principles.\r\n\r\nIn the above advertisement clipped from the Baltimore Sun, he is more\r\nfully described by Mr. Levi Pumphrey; it can now be taken for what it is\r\nworth. But, as Hanson left home suddenly without apprising his owner, or\r\nany of his owner's intimate white friends, of the circumstances which\r\nled him to thus leave, his testimony and explanation, although late, may\r\nnot be wholly uninteresting to Mr. Levi Pumphrey and others who took an\r\ninterest in the missing \"Hanson.\" \"How have you had it in slavery?\" he\r\nwas asked. \"I have had it pretty rough,\" answered Hanson. \"Who held you\r\nin bondage, and how have you been treated?\" \"I was owned by Levi\r\nPumphrey, an old man with one eye, a perfect savage; he allowed no\r\nprivileges of any kind, Sunday or Monday.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGusta, who was also described in Pumphrey's advertisement, was a\r\nrugged-looking specimen, and his statement tended to strengthen Hanson's\r\nin every particular. It was owing to the bad treatment of Pumphrey, that\r\nGusta left in the manner that he did.\r\n\r\nAfter deciding to take his departure for Canada, he provided himself\r\nwith a Colt's revolver, and resolved that if any man should attempt to\r\nput his hand on him while he was on the \"King's highway,\" he would shoot\r\nhim down, not excepting his old master.\r\n\r\n\r\n    $150 REWARD.--Ran away from the subscriber, living near Upper\r\n    Marlboro', Prince George's county, Md., on the 11th day of\r\n    September, 1858, a negro man, \"Nace,\" who calls himself \"Nace\r\n    Shaw;\" is forty-five years of age, about five feet 8 or 9 inches\r\n    high, of a copper color, full suit of hair, except a bald place\r\n    upon the top of his head. He has a mother living in Washington\r\n    city, on South B street, No. 212 Island.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n    I will pay the above reward no matter where taken, if secured in\r\n    jail so that I get him again.\r\n\r\n    SARAH ANN TALBURTT.\r\n\r\n    sl5-eotf.\r\n\r\n\r\nNace, advertised by Miss Sarah Ann Talburtt, was a remarkably\r\ngood-natured looking piece of merchandise. He gave a very interesting\r\naccount of his so called mistress, how he came to leave her, etc. Said\r\nNace: \"My mistress was an old maid, and lived on a farm. I was her\r\nforeman on the farm. She lived near Marlborough Forest, in Prince\r\nGeorge's county, Md., about twelve miles from Washington; she was a\r\nmember of the Episcopal Church. She fed well, and quarrelled a caution,\r\nfrom Monday morning till Saturday night, not only with the slaves, but\r\namong the inmates of the big house. My mistress had three sisters, all\r\nold maids living with her, and a niece besides; their names were\r\nRebecca, Rachel, Caroline, and Sarah Ann, and a more disagreeable family\r\nof old maids could not be found in a year's time. To arise in the\r\nmorning before my mistress, Sarah Ann, was impossible.\" Then, without\r\nmaking it appear that he or other of the slaves had been badly treated\r\nunder Miss Talburtt, he entered upon the cause of escape, and said; \"I\r\nleft simply because I wanted a chance for my life; I wanted to die a\r\nfree man if it pleased God to have it so.\" His wife and a grown-up son\r\nhe was obliged to leave, as no opportunity offered to bring them away\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDan was also of this party. He was well tinctured with Anglo-Saxon\r\nblood. His bondage had been in Alexandria, with a mill-wright, known by\r\nthe name of James Garnett. Dan had not been in Garnett's hands a great\r\nwhile. Mr. Garnett's ways and manners were not altogether pleasing to\r\nhim; besides, Dan stated that he was trying to sell him, and he made up\r\nhis mind that at an early opportunity, he would avail himself of a\r\nticket for Canada, via the Underground Rail Road. He left his mother and\r\nbrothers all scattered.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCROSSING THE BAY IN A SKIFF.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM THOMAS COPE, JOHN BOICE GREY, HENRY BOICE AND ISAAC WHITE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese young bondmen, whilst writhing under the tortures heaped upon\r\nthem, resolved, at the cost of life, to make a desperate trial for free\r\nland; to rid themselves of their fetters, at whatever peril they might\r\nhave to encounter. The land route presented less encouragement than by\r\nwater; they knew but little, however, concerning either way. After much\r\nanxious reflection, they finally decided to make their Underground Rail\r\nRoad exit by water. Having lived all their lives not far from the bay,\r\nthey had some knowledge of small boats, skiffs in particular, but of\r\ncourse they were not the possessors of one. Feeling that there was no\r\ntime to lose, they concluded to borrow a skiff, though they should never\r\nreturn it. So one Saturday evening, toward the latter part of January,\r\nthe four young slaves stood on the beach near Lewes, Delaware, and cast\r\ntheir longing eyes in the direction of the Jersey shore. A fierce gale\r\nwas blowing, and the waves were running fearfully high; not daunted,\r\nhowever, but as one man they resolved to take their lives in their hands\r\nand make the bold adventure.\r\n\r\nWith simple faith they entered the skiff; two of them took the oars,\r\nmanfully to face uncertain dangers from the waves. But they remained\r\nsteadfast, oft as they felt that they were making the last stroke with\r\ntheir oars, on the verge of being overwhelmed with the waves. At every\r\nnew stage of danger they summoned courage by remembering that they were\r\nescaping for their lives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nLate on Sunday afternoon, the following day, they reached their much\r\ndesired haven, the Jersey shore. The relief and joy were unspeakably\r\ngreat, yet they were strangers in a strange land. They knew not which\r\nway to steer. True, they knew that New Jersey bore the name of being a\r\nFree State; but they had reason to fear that they were in danger. In\r\nthis dilemma they were discovered by the captain of an oyster boat whose\r\nsense of humanity was so strongly appealed to by their appearance that\r\nhe engaged to pilot them to Philadelphia. The following account of them\r\nwas recorded:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Thomas was a yellow man, twenty-four years of age, and\r\npossessing a vigorous constitution. He accused Shepherd P. Houston of\r\nhaving restrained him of his liberty, and testified that said Houston\r\nwas a very bad man. His vocation was that of a farmer, on a small scale;\r\nas a slave-holder he was numbered with the \"small fry.\" Both master and\r\nmistress were members of the Methodist Church. According to William\r\nThomas' testimony his mistress as well as his master was very hard on\r\nthe slaves in various ways, especially in the matter of food and\r\nclothing. It would require a great deal of hard preaching to convince\r\nhim that such Christianity was other than spurious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn stated that David Henry Houston, a farmer, took it upon himself to\r\nexercise authority over him. Said John, \"If you didn't do the work\r\nright, he got contrary, and wouldn't give you anything to eat for a\r\nwhole day at a time; he said a 'nigger and a mule hadn't any feeling.'\"\r\nHe described his stature and circumstances somewhat thus: \"Houston is a\r\nvery small man; for some time his affairs had been in a bad way; he had\r\nbeen broke, some say he had bad luck for killing my brother. My brother\r\nwas sick, but master said he wasn't sick, and he took a chunk, and beat\r\non him, and he died a few days after.\" John firmly believed that his\r\nbrother had been the victim of a monstrous outrage, and that he too was\r\nliable to the same treatment.\r\n\r\nJohn was only nineteen years of age, spare built, chestnut color, and\r\nrepresented the rising mind of the slaves of the South.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry was what might be termed a very smart young man, considering that\r\nhe had been deprived of a knowledge of reading. He was a brother of\r\nJohn, and said that he also had been wrongfully enslaved by David\r\nHouston, alluded to above. He fully corroborated the statement of his\r\nbrother, and declared, moreover, that his sister had not long since been\r\nsold South, and that he had heard enough to fully convince him that he\r\nand his brother were to be put up for sale soon.\r\n\r\nOf their mistress John said that she was a \"pretty easy kind of a woman,\r\nonly she didn't want to allow enough to eat, and wouldn't mend any\r\nclothes for us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIsaac was twenty-two, quite black, and belonged to the \"rising\" young\r\nslaves of Delaware. He stated that he had been owned by a \"blacksmith, a\r\nvery hard man, by the name of Thomas Carper.\" Isaac was disgusted with\r\nhis master's ignorance, and criticised him, in his crude way, to a\r\nconsiderable extent. Isaac had learned blacksmithing under Carper. Both\r\nmaster and mistress were Methodists. Isaac said that he \"could not\r\nrecommend his mistress, as she was given to bad practices,\" so much so\r\nthat he could hardly endure her. He also charged the blacksmith with\r\nbeing addicted to bad habits. Sometimes Isaac would be called upon to\r\nreceive correction from his master, which would generally be dealt out\r\nwith a \"chunk of wood\" over his \"no feeling\" head. On a late occasion,\r\nwhen Isaac was being _chunked_ beyond measure, he resisted, but the\r\npersistent blacksmith did not yield until he had so far disabled Isaac\r\nthat he was rendered helpless for the next two weeks. While in this\r\nstate he pledged himself to freedom and Canada, and resolved to win the\r\nprize by crossing the Bay.\r\n\r\nWhile these young passengers possessed brains and bravery of a rare\r\norder, at the same time they brought with them an unusual amount of the\r\nsoil of Delaware; their persons and old worn-out clothing being full of\r\nit. Their appearance called loudly for immediate cleansing. A room--free\r\nwater--free soap, and such other assistance as was necessary was\r\ntendered them in order to render the work as thorough as possible. This\r\nhealthy process over, clean and comfortable clothing were furnished, and\r\nthe change in their appearance was so marked, that they might have\r\npassed as strangers, if not in the immediate corn-fields of their\r\nmasters, certainly among many of their old acquaintances, unless\r\nsubjected to the most careful inspection. Raised in the country and on\r\nfarms, their masters and mistresses had never dreamed of encouraging\r\nthem to conform to habits of cleanliness; washing their persons and\r\nchanging their garments were not common occurrences. The coarse garment\r\nonce on would be clung to without change as long as it would hold\r\ntogether. The filthy cabins allotted for their habitations were in\r\nthemselves incentives to personal uncleanliness. In some districts this\r\nwas more apparent than in others. From some portions of Maryland and\r\nDelaware, in particular, passengers brought lamentable evidence of a\r\nwant of knowledge and improvement in this direction. But the master, not\r\nthe slave, was blameworthy. The master, as has been intimated, found but\r\none suit for working (and sometimes none for Sunday), consequently if\r\nTom was set to ditching one day and became muddy and dirty, and the next\r\nday he was required to haul manure, his ditching suit had to be used,\r\nand if the next day he was called into the harvest-field, he was still\r\nobliged to wear his barn-yard suit, and so on to the end. Frequently\r\nhave such passengers been thoroughly cleansed for the first time in\r\ntheir lives at the Philadelphia station. Some needed practical lessons\r\nbefore they understood the thoroughness necessary to cleansing. Before\r\nundertaking the operation, therefore, in order that they might be made\r\nto feel the benefit to be derived therefrom, they would need to have the\r\nmatter brought home to them in a very gentle way, lest they might feign\r\nto fear taking cold, not having been used to it, etc.\r\n\r\nIt was customary to say to them: \"We want to give you some clean\r\nclothing, but you need washing before putting them on. It will make you\r\nfeel like a new man to have the dirt of slavery all washed off. Nothing\r\nthat could be done for you would make you feel better after the fatigue\r\nof travel than a thorough bath. Probably you have not been allowed the\r\nopportunity of taking a good bath, and so have not enjoyed one since\r\nyour mother bathed you. Don't be afraid of the water or soap--the harder\r\nyou rub yourself the better you will feel. Shall we not wash your back\r\nand neck for you? We want you to look well while traveling on the\r\nUnderground Rail Road, and not forget from this time forth to try to\r\ntake care of yourself,\" &c., &c. By this course the reluctance where it\r\nexisted would be overcome and the proposition would be readily acceded\r\nto, if the water was not too cool; on the other hand, if cool, a slight\r\nshudder might be visible, sufficient to raise a hearty laugh. Yet, when\r\nthrough, the candidate always expressed a hearty sense of satisfaction,\r\nand was truly thankful for this attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM KENT COUNTY, MD., 1858.\r\n\r\nASBURY IRWIN, EPHRAIM ENNIS, AND LYDIA ANN JOHNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe party whose narratives are here given brought grave charges against\r\na backsliding member of the Society of Friends--a renegade Quaker.\r\n\r\nDoubtless rare instances may be found where men of the Quaker\r\npersuasion, emigrating from free and settling in slave States and among\r\nslaveholders, have deserted their freedom-loving principle and led\r\ncaptive by the force of bad examples, have linked hands with the\r\noppressor against the oppressed. It is probable, however, that this is\r\nthe only case that may turn up in these records to the disgrace of this\r\nbody of Christians in whom dwelt in such a signal degree large sympathy\r\nfor the slave and the fleeing bondman. Many fugitives were indebted to\r\nFriends who aided them in a quiet way, not allowing their left hand to\r\nknow what their right hand did, and the result was that Underground Rail\r\nRoad operations were always pretty safe and prosperous where the line of\r\ntravel led through \"Quaker settlements.\" We can speak with great\r\nconfidence on this point especially with regard to Pennsylvania, where a\r\ngoodly number might be named, if necessary, whose hearts, houses,\r\nhorses, and money were always found ready and willing to assist the\r\nfugitive from the prison-house. It is with no little regret that we feel\r\nthat truth requires us to connect the so-called owner of Asbury,\r\nEphraim, and Lydia with the Quakers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAsbury was first examined, and his story ran substantially thus: \"I run\r\naway because I was used bad; three years ago I was knocked dead with an\r\naxe by my master; the blood run out of my head as if it had been poured\r\nout of a tumbler; you can see the mark plain enough--look here,\" (with\r\nhis finger on the spot). \"I left Millington, at the head of Chester in\r\nKent County, Maryland, where I had been held by a farmer who called\r\nhimself Michael Newbold. He was originally from Mount Holly, New Jersey,\r\nbut had been living in Maryland over twenty years. He was called a\r\nHickory Quaker, and he had a real Quaker for a wife. Before he was in\r\nMaryland five years he bought slaves, became a regular slave-holder, got\r\nto drinking and racing horses, and was very bad--treated all hands bad,\r\nhis wife too, so that she had to leave him and go to Philadelphia to her\r\nkinsfolks. It was because he was so bad we all had to leave,\" &c.\r\n\r\nWhile Asbury's story appeared truthful and simple, a portion of it was\r\ntoo shocking to morality and damaging to humanity to be inserted in\r\nthese pages.\r\n\r\nAsbury was about forty years of age, a man of dark hue, size and height\r\nabout mediocrity, and mental ability quite above the average.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEphraim was a fellow-servant and companion of Asbury. He was a man of\r\nsuperior physical strength, and from all outward appearance, he\r\npossessed qualities susceptible of ready improvement. He not only spoke\r\nof Newbold in terms of strong condemnation but of slave-holders and\r\nslavery everywhere. The lessons he had learned gave him ample\r\nopportunity to speak from experience and from what he had observed in\r\nthe daily practices of slave-holders; consequently, with his ordinary\r\ngifts, it was impossible for him to utter his earnest feelings without\r\nmaking a deep impression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLydia also fled from Michael Newbold. She was a young married woman,\r\nonly twenty-two years of age, of a chestnut color and a pleasant\r\ncountenance. Her flight for liberty cost her her husband, as she was\r\nobliged to leave him behind. What understanding was entered into between\r\nthem prior to her departure we failed to note at the time. It was very\r\nclear that she had decided never to wear the yoke again.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM WASHINGTON, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPHINE ROBINSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany reasons were given by Josephine for leaving the sunny South. She\r\nhad a mistress, but was not satisfied with her--hadn't a particle of\r\nlove for her; \"she was all the time fussing and scolding, and never\r\ncould be satisfied.\" She was very well off, and owned thirteen or\r\nfourteen head of slaves. She was a member of the Methodist Church, was\r\nstingy and very mean towards her slaves. Josephine having lived with her\r\nall her life, professed to have a thorough knowledge of her ways and\r\nmanners, and seemed disposed to speak truthfully of her. The name of her\r\nmistress was Eliza Hambleton, and she lived in Washington. Josephine had\r\nfully thought over the matter of her rights, so much so, that she was\r\nprompted to escape. So hard did she feel her lot to be, that she was\r\ncompelled to resign her children, uncle and aunt to the cruel mercy of\r\nslavery. What became of the little ones, David, Ogden and Isaiah, is a\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM CECIL COUNTY, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT JOHNS AND HIS WIFE \"SUE ANN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFortunately, in this instance, man and wife succeeded in making their\r\nway out of Slavery together. Robert was a man of small stature, and the\r\nfarthest shade from white. In appearance and intellect he represented\r\nthe ordinary Maryland slave, raised on a farm, surrounded with no\r\nrefining influences or sympathy. He stated that a man by the name of\r\nWilliam Cassey had claimed the right to his labor, and that he had been\r\nkept in bondage on his farm.\r\n\r\nFor a year or more before setting out for freedom, Robert had watched\r\nhis master pretty closely, and came to the conclusion, that he was \"a\r\nmonstrous blustery kind of a man; one of the old time fellows, very hard\r\nand rash--not fit to own a dog.\" He owned twelve slaves; Robert resolved\r\nthat he would make one less in a short while. He laid the matter before\r\nhis wife, \"Sue,\" who was said to be the property of Susan Flinthrew,\r\nwife of John Flinthrew, of Cecil county, Maryland. \"Sue\" having suffered\r\nseverely, first from one and then another, sometimes from floggings, and\r\nat other times from hunger, and again from not being half clothed in\r\ncold weather, was prepared to consider any scheme that looked in the\r\ndirection of speedy deliverance. The way that they were to travel, and\r\nthe various points of danger to be passed on the road were fully\r\nconsidered; but Robert and Sue were united and agreed that they could\r\nnot fare much worse than they had fared, should they be captured and\r\ncarried back. In this state of mind, as in the case of thousands of\r\nothers, they set out for a free State, and in due time reached\r\nPennsylvania and the Vigilance Committee, to whom they made known the\r\nfacts here recorded, and received aid and comfort in return.\r\n\r\nSue was a young woman of twenty-three, of a brown color, and somewhat\r\nunder medium size.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM GEORGETOWN, D.C., 1858.\r\n\r\nPERRY CLEXTON, JIM BANKS AND CHARLES NOLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis party found no very serious obstacles in their travels, as their\r\nplans were well arranged, and as they had at least natural ability\r\nsufficient for ordinary emergencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPerry reported that he left \"a man by the name of John M. Williams, of\r\nGeorgetown, D.C., who was in the wood business, and kept a wharf.\" As to\r\ntreatment, he said that he had not been used very hard, but had been\r\nworked hard and allowed but few privileges. The paltry sum of\r\ntwenty-five cents a week, was all that was allowed him out of his hire.\r\nWith a wife and one child this might seem a small sum, but in reality it\r\nwas a liberal outlay compared with what many slaves were allowed. Perry\r\nbeing a ready-witted article, thought that it was hardly fair that Mr.\r\nWilliams should live by the sweat of his brow instead of his own; he was\r\na large, portly man, and able to work for himself in Perry's opinion.\r\nFor a length of time, the notion of leaving and going to Canada was\r\nuppermost in his heart; probably he would have acted with more\r\npromptness but for the fact that his wife and child rested with great\r\nweight on his mind. Finally the pressure became so great that he felt\r\nthat he must leave at all hazards, forsaking wife and child, master and\r\nchains. He was a young man, of about twenty-five years of age, of a dark\r\nshade, ordinary build, and full of grit. His wife was named Amelia;\r\nwhether she ever afterwards heard from her husband is a question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJim, who accompanied Perry, brought the shoe-making art with him. He had\r\nbeen held a slave under John J. Richards, although he was quite as much\r\na white man as he was black. He was a mulatto, twenty-nine years of age,\r\nwell-made, and bore a grum countenance, but a brave and manly will to\r\nkeep up his courage on the way. He said that he had been used very well,\r\nhad no fault to find with John J. Richards, who was possibly a near\r\nrelative of his. He forsook his mother, four brothers and three sisters\r\nwith no hope of ever seeing them again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles bore strong testimony in favor of his master, Blooker W.\r\nHansborough, a farmer, a first-rate man to his servants, said Charles.\r\n\"I was used very well, can't complain.\" \"Why did you not remain then?\"\r\nasked a member of the Committee. \"I left,\" answered C., \"because I was\r\nnot allowed to live with my wife. She with our six children, lived a\r\nlong distance from my master's place, and he would not hire me out where\r\nI could live near my wife, so I made up my mind that I would try and do\r\nbetter. I could see no enjoyment that way.\" As the secret of his\r\nmaster's treatment is here brought to light, it is very evident that\r\nCharles, in speaking so highly in his favor, failed to take a just view\r\nof him, as no man could really be first-rate to his servants, who would\r\nnot allow a man to live with his wife and children, and who would\r\npersist in taking from another what he had no right to take.\r\nNevertheless, as Charles thought his master \"first-rate,\" he shall have\r\nthe benefit of the opinion, but it was suspected that Charles was not\r\ndisposed to find fault with his kin, as it was very likely that the old\r\nmaster claimed some of the white blood in his veins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM SUSSEX COUNTY, 1858.\r\n\r\nJACOB BLOCKSON, GEORGE ALLIGOOD, JIM ALLIGOOD, AND GEORGE LEWIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coming of Jacob and his companions was welcomed in the usual way.\r\nThe marks of Slavery upon them were evident; however they were subjected\r\nto the usual critical examination, which they bore with composure, and\r\nwithout the least damage. The following notes in the main were recorded\r\nfrom their statements:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJacob was a stout and healthy-looking man, about twenty-seven years of\r\nage, with a countenance indicative of having no sympathy with Slavery.\r\nBeing invited to tell his own story, describe his master, etc., he\r\nunhesitatingly relieved himself somewhat after this manner; \"I escaped\r\nfrom a man by the name of Jesse W. Paten; he was a man of no business,\r\nexcept drinking whiskey, and farming. He was a light complected man,\r\ntall large, and full-faced, with a large nose. He was a widower. He\r\nbelonged to no society of any kind. He lived near Seaford, in Sussex\r\ncounty, Delaware.\"\r\n\r\n\"I left because I didn't want to stay with him any longer. My master was\r\nabout to be sold out this Fall, and I made up my mind that I did not\r\nwant to be sold like a horse, the way they generally sold darkies then;\r\nso when I started I resolved to die sooner than I would be taken back;\r\nthis was my intention all the while.\r\n\r\n\"I left my wife, and one child; the wife's name was Lear, and the child\r\nwas called Alexander. I want to get them on soon too. I made some\r\narrangements for their coming if I got off safe to Canada.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge was next called upon to give his statement concerning where he\r\nwas from, etc. I \"scaped\" from Sussex too, from a man by the name of\r\nGeorge M. Davis, a large man, dark-complected, and about fifty years of\r\nage; he belonged to the old side Methodist Church, was a man with a\r\nfamily, and followed farming, or had farming done by me and others.\r\nBesides he was a justice of the peace. I always believed that the Master\r\nabove had no wish for me to be held in bondage all my days; but I\r\nthought if I made up my mind to stay in Slavery, and not to make a\r\ndesperate trial for my freedom, I would never have any better times. I\r\nhad heard that my old mistress had willed me to her children, and\r\nchildren's children. I thought at this rate there was no use of holding\r\non any longer for the good time to come, so here I said, I am going, if\r\nI die a trying. I got me a dagger, and made up my mind if they attempted\r\nto take me on the road, I would have one man. As for my part, I have not\r\nhad it so slavish as many, but I have never had any privileges to learn\r\nto read, or to go about anywhere. Now and then they let me go to church.\r\nMy master belonged to church, and so did I.\r\n\r\nFor a young man, being only twenty-two years of age, who had been kept\r\nfrom the light of freedom, as much as he had, his story was thought to\r\nbe exceedingly well told throughout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames, a brother of George, said: \"I came from Horse's Cross-Roads, not\r\nfar from where my brother George came from. William Gray, rail road\r\nticket agent at Bridgewater, professed to own me. He was a tolerable\r\nsized man, with very large whiskers, and dark hair; he was rather a\r\nsteady kind of a man, he had a wife, but no child. The reason I left, I\r\nthought I had served Slavery long enough, as I had been treated none the\r\nbest. I did not believe in working my life out just to support some body\r\nelse. My master had as many hands and feet as I have, and is as able to\r\nwork for his bread as I am; and I made up my mind that I wouldn't stay\r\nto be a slave under him any longer, but that I would go to Canada, and\r\nbe my own master.\"\r\n\r\nJames left his poor wife, and three children, slaves perhaps for life.\r\nThe wife's name was Esther Ann, the children were called Mary, Henry,\r\nand Harriet. All belonged to Jesse Laten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Lewis had more years than any of his companions, being about\r\nforty years of age. He had been kept in as low a state of ignorance as\r\nthe ingenuity of a slave-holder of Delaware could keep one possessed of\r\nas much mother-wit as he was, for he was not quite so ignorant as the\r\ninterests of the system required. His physical make and mental capacity\r\nwere good. He was decidedly averse to the peculiar institution in every\r\nparticular. He stated, that a man named Samuel Laws had held him in\r\nbondage--that this \"Laws was a man of no business--just sat about the\r\nhouse and went about from store to store and sat; that he was an old\r\nman, pretty grey, very long hair. He was a member of a church in the\r\nneighborhood, which was called Radical.\" Of this church and its members\r\nhe could give but little account, either of their peculiarities or\r\ncreed; he said, however, that they worshipped a good deal like the\r\nMethodists, and allowed their members to swear heartily for slavery.\r\n\r\n\"Something told\" George that he had worked long enough as a slave, and\r\nthat he should be man enough to take the Underground Rail Road and go\r\noff to a free country. Accordingly George set out. When he arrived at\r\nthe station he was so highly delighted with his success and the prospect\r\nbefore him, that he felt very sorry that he hadn't started ten years\r\nsooner. He said that he would have done so, but he was afraid, as\r\nslave-holders were always making the slaves believe that if they should\r\never escape they would catch them and bring them back and sell them down\r\nSouth, certain; that they always did catch every one who ran off, but\r\nnever brought them home, but sold them right off where they could never\r\nrun away any more, or get to see their relatives again. This threat,\r\nGeorge said, was continually rung in the ears of the slaves, and with\r\nthe more timid it was very effective.\r\n\r\nJacob Blockson, after reaching Canada, true to the pledge that he made\r\nto his bosom companion, wrote back as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    SAINT CATHARINES. Cannda West, Dec. 26th, 1858.\r\n\r\n    DEAR WIFE:--I now infom you I am in Canada and am well and hope\r\n    you are the same, and would wish you to be here next august, you\r\n    come to suspension bridge and from there to St. Catharines,\r\n    write and let me know. I am doing well working for a Butcher\r\n    this winter, and will get good wages in the spring I now get\r\n    $2,50 a week.\r\n\r\n    I Jacob Blockson, George Lewis, George Alligood and James\r\n    Alligood are all in St. Catharines, and met George Ross from\r\n    Lewis Wright's, Jim Blockson is in Canada West, and Jim Delany,\r\n    Plunnoth Connon. I expect you my wife Lea Ann Blockson, my son\r\n    Alexander & Lewis and Ames will all be here and Isabella also,\r\n    if you cant bring all bring Alexander surely, write when you\r\n    will come and I will meet you in Albany. Love to you all, from\r\n    your loving Husband,\r\n\r\n    JACOB BLOCKSON.\r\n\r\n    fare through $12,30 to here.\r\n\r\n    MR. STILL: SIR:--you will please Envelope this and send it to\r\n    John Sheppard Bridgeville P office in Sussex county Delaware,\r\n    seal it in black and oblige me, write to her to come to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDRY ARRIVALS IN 1859.\r\n\r\nSARAH ANN MILLS, Boonsborough; CAROLINE GASSWAY, Mt. Airy; LEVIN HOLDEN,\r\nLaurel; WILLIAM JAMES CONNER, with his wife, child, and four brothers;\r\nJAMES LAZARUS, Delaware; RICHARD WILLIAMS, Richmond, Virginia; SYDNEY\r\nHOPKINS and HENRY WHEELER, Havre de Grace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Mills set out for freedom long before she reached womanhood; being\r\nabout sixteen years of age. She stated that she had been very cruelly\r\ntreated, that she was owned by a man named Joseph O'Neil, \"a tax\r\ncollector and a very bad man.\"  Under said O'Neil she had been required\r\nto chop wood, curry horses, work in the field like a man, and all one\r\nwinter she had been compelled to go barefooted. Three weeks before Sarah\r\nfled, her mistress was called away by death; nevertheless Sarah could\r\nnot forget how badly she had been treated by her while living. According\r\nto Sarah's testimony the mistress was no better than her husband. Sarah\r\ncame from Boonsborough, near Hagerstown, Md., leaving her mother and\r\nother relatives in that neighborhood.\r\n\r\nIt was gratifying to know that such bond-women so early got beyond the\r\ncontrol of slave-holders; yet girls of her age from having had no pains\r\ntaken for their improvement, appealed loudly for more than common\r\nsympathy and humanity, but rarely ever found it; on the contrary, their\r\npaths were beset with great danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCaroline Gassway, after being held to service by Summersett Walters,\r\nuntil she had reached her twenty-seventh year, was forced, by hard\r\ntreatment and the love of freedom, to make an effort for deliverance.\r\nHer appearance at once indicated, although she was just out of the\r\nprison-house, that she possessed more than an ordinary share of courage,\r\nand that she had had a keen insight into the system under which she had\r\nbeen oppressed. She was of a dark chestnut color, well-formed, with a\r\nlarge and high forehead, indicative of intellect. She had much to say of\r\nthe ways and practices of slave-holders; of the wrongs of the system.\r\nShe dwelt especially upon her own situation as a slave, and the\r\ncharacter of her master; she told not only of his ill treatment of her,\r\nbut described his physical appearance as well. \"He was a spare-made man,\r\nwith a red head and quick temper: he would go off in a flurry like a\r\nflash of powder, and would behave shamefully towards the slaves when in\r\nthese fits of passion.\" His wife, however, Caroline confessed was of a\r\ndifferent temper, and was a pretty good kind of a woman. If he had been\r\nanything like his wife in disposition, most likely Caroline would have\r\nremained in bondage. Fortunately, Caroline was a single woman. She left\r\nher mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLevin Holden, having been sold only a few weeks prior to his escape, was\r\nso affected by the change which awaited him, that he was irresistibly\r\nled to seek the Underground Rail Road. Previous to being sold he was\r\nunder a master by the name of Jonathan Bailey, who followed farming in\r\nthe neighborhood of Laurel, Delaware, and, as a master, was considered a\r\nmoderate man--was also well to do in the world; but the new master he\r\ncould not endure, as he had already let the secret out that Levin was to\r\nbe sent South. Levin had a perfect horror of a more Southern latitude;\r\nhe made up his mind that he would try his luck for Canada. Levin was a\r\nman of twenty-seven years of age, smart, dark color, and of a good size\r\nfor all sorts of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam James Conner, his wife, child, and four brothers came next. The\r\nbrothers were hale-looking fellows, and would have commanded high prices\r\nin any market South of Mason and Dixon's Line. It was said, that they\r\nwere the property of Kendall Major Lewis, who lived near Laurel,\r\nDelaware. It was known, however, that he never had any deed from the\r\nAlmighty, but oppressed them without any just right so to do; they were\r\nperfectly justifiable in leaving Kendall Major Lewis, and all his\r\nsympathizers, to take care of themselves as best they could.\r\n\r\nNo very serious charges were made against Lewis, but on the contrary\r\nthey said, that he had been looked upon as a \"moderate slave-holder;\"\r\nthey also said, that \"he had been a member of the Methodist Episcopal\r\nChurch for fifty years, and stood high in that body.\" Furthermore they\r\nstated, that he sold slaves occasionally. Eight had been sold by him\r\nsome time before this party escaped (two of them to Georgia); besides\r\nWilliam James had been sold and barely found opportunity to escape. Wm.\r\nJames, Major Lewis, Dennis Betts, Peter, and Lazarus, with the wife and\r\nchild of the former, not only found themselves stripped from day to day\r\nof their hard earnings, but fearful forebodings of the auction-block\r\nwere ever uppermost in their minds. While they spoke of Lewis as\r\n\"moderate,\" etc., they all said that he allowed no privileges to his\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard Williams gave a full account of himself, but only a meagre\r\nreport was recorded. He said that he came from Richmond, and left\r\nbecause he was on the point of being sold by John A. Smith, who owned\r\nhim. He gave Smith credit for being a tolerable fair kind of a\r\nslave-holder, but added, that \"his wife was a notoriously hard woman;\"\r\nshe had made a very deep impression on Richard's mind by her treatment\r\nof him. In finding himself on free ground, however, with cheering\r\nprospects ahead, he did not stop to brood over the ills that he had\r\nsuffered, but rejoiced heartily. He left his wife, Julia, who was free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSydney Hopkins and Henry Wheeler. These young men made their way out of\r\nSlavery together. While Sydney lives he will forever regard Jacob Hoag,\r\nof Havre-de-Grace, as the person who cheated him out of himself, and\r\nprevented him from becoming enlightened and educated.\r\n\r\nHenry, his companion, was also from Havre De Grace. He had had trouble\r\nwith a man by the name of Amos Barnes, or in other words Barnes claimed\r\nto own him, just as he owned a horse or a mule, and daily controlled him\r\nin about the same manner that he would manage the animals above alluded\r\nto. Henry could find no justification for such treatment. He suffered\r\ngreatly under the said Barnes, and finally his eyes were open to see\r\nthat there was an Underground Rail Road for the benefit of all such\r\nslavery-sick souls as himself. So he got a ticket as soon as possible,\r\nand came through without accident, leaving Amos Barnes to do the best he\r\ncould for a living. This candidate for Canada was twenty-one years of\r\nage, and a likely-looking boy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph Henry Hill. The spirit of freedom in this passenger was truly the\r\n\"one idea\" notion. At the age of twenty-eight his purpose to free\r\nhimself by escaping on the Underground Rail Road was successfully\r\ncarried into effect, although not without difficulty. Joseph was a fair\r\nspecimen of a man physically and mentally, could read and write, and\r\nthereby keep the run of matters of interest on the Slavery question.\r\n\r\nJames Thomas, Jr., a tobacco merchant, in Richmond, had Joe down in his\r\nledger as a marketable piece of property, or a handy machine to save\r\nlabor, and make money. To Joe's great joy he heard the sound of the\r\nUnderground Rail Road bell in Richmond,--had a satisfactory interview\r\nwith the conductor,--received a favorable response, and was soon a\r\ntraveler on his way to Canada. He left his mother, a free woman, and two\r\nsisters in chains. He had been sold twice, but he never meant to be sold\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM RICHMOND, 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORNELIUS HENRY JOHNSON. FACE CANADA-WARD FOR YEARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuite an agreeable interview took place between Cornelius and the\r\nCommittee. He gave his experience of Slavery pretty fully, and the\r\nCommittee enlightened him as to the workings of the Underground Rail\r\nRoad, the value of freedom, and the safety of Canada as a refuge.\r\n\r\nCornelius was a single man, thirty-six years of age, full black, medium\r\nsize, and intelligent. He stated that he had had his face set toward\r\nCanada for a long while. Three times he had made an effort to get out of\r\nthe prison-house. \"Within the last four or five years, times have gone\r\npretty hard with me. My mistress, Mrs. Mary F. Price, had lately put me\r\nin charge of her brother, Samuel M. Bailey, a tobacco merchant of\r\nRichmond. Both believed in nothing as they did in Slavery; they would\r\nsooner see a black man dead than free. They were about second class in\r\nsociety. He and his sister own well on to one hundred head, though\r\nwithin the last few years he has been thinning off the number by sale. I\r\nwas allowed one dollar a week for my board; one dollar is the usual\r\nallowance for slaves in my situation. On Christmas week he allowed me no\r\nboard money, but made me a present of seventy-five cents; my mistress\r\nadded twenty-five cents, which was the extent of their liberality. I was\r\nwell cared for. When the slaves got sick he doctored them himself, he\r\nwas too stingy to employ a physician. If they did not get well as soon\r\nas he thought they should, he would order them to their work, and if\r\nthey did not go he would beat them. My cousin was badly beat last year\r\nin the presence of his wife, and he was right sick. Mr. Bailey was a\r\nmember of St. James' church, on Fifth street, and my mistress was a\r\ncommunicant of the First Baptist church on Broad Street. She let on to\r\nbe very good.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am one of a family of sixteen; my mother and eleven sisters and\r\nbrothers are now living; some have been sold to Alabama, and some to\r\nTennessee, the rest are held in Richmond. My mother is now old, but is\r\nstill in the service of Bailey. He promised to take care of her in her\r\nold age, and not compel her to labor, so she is only required to cook\r\nand wash for a dozen slaves. This they consider a great favor to the old\r\n'grandmother.' It was only a year ago he cursed her and threatened her\r\nwith a flogging. I left for nothing else but because I was dissatisfied\r\nwith Slavery. The threats of my master caused me to reflect on the North\r\nand South. I had an idea that I was not to die in Slavery. I believed\r\nthat God would assist me if I would try. I then made up my mind to put\r\nmy case in the hands of God, and start for the Underground Rail Road. I\r\nbade good-bye to the old tobacco factory on Seventh street, and the\r\nFirst African Baptist church on Broad street (where he belonged), where\r\nI had so often heard the minister preach 'servants obey your masters;'\r\nalso to the slave pens, chain-gangs, and a cruel master and mistress,\r\nall of which I hoped to leave forever. But to bid good-bye to my old\r\nmother in chains, was no easy job, and if my desire for freedom had not\r\nbeen as strong as my desire for life itself, I could never have stood\r\nit; but I felt that I could do her no good; could not help her if I\r\nstaid. As I was often threatened by my master, with the auction-block, I\r\nfelt I must give up all and escape for my life.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was substantially the story of Cornelius Henry Johnson. He talked\r\nfor an hour as one inspired, and as none but fugitive slaves could talk.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM DELAWARE, 1858.\r\n\r\nTHEOPHILUS COLLINS, ANDREW JACKSON BOYCE, HANDY BURTON AND ROBERT\r\nJACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DESPERATE, BLOODY STRUGGLE--GUN, KNIFE AND FIRE SHOVEL, USED BY AN\r\nINFURIATED MASTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nJudged from their outward appearance, as well as from the fact that they\r\nwere from the neighboring State of Delaware, no extraordinary\r\nrevelations were looked for from the above-named party. It was found,\r\nhowever, that one of their number, at least, had a sad tale of outrage\r\nand cruelty to relate. The facts stated are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheophilus is twenty-four years of age, dark, height and stature hardly\r\nmedium, with faculties only about average compared with ordinary\r\nfugitives from Delaware and Maryland. His appearance is in no way\r\nremarkable. His bearing is subdued and modest; yet he is not lacking in\r\nearnestness. Says Theophilus, \"I was in servitude under a man named\r\nHouston, near Lewes, Delaware; he was a very mean man, he didn't allow\r\nyou enough to eat, nor enough clothes to wear. He never allowed a drop\r\nof tea, or coffee, or sugar, and if you didn't eat your breakfast before\r\nday he wouldn't allow you any, but would drive you out without any. He\r\nhad a wife; she was mean, too, meaner than he was. Four years ago last\r\nFall my master cut my entrails out for going to meeting at Daniel\r\nWesley's church one Sabbath night. Before day, Monday morning, he called\r\nme up to whip me; called me into his dining-room, locked the doors, then\r\nordered me to pull off my shirt. I told him no, sir, I wouldn't; right\r\naway he went and got the cowhide, and gave me about twenty over my head\r\nwith the butt. He tore my shirt off, after I would not pull it off; he\r\nordered me to cross my hands. I didn't do that. After I wouldn't do that\r\nhe went and got his gun. and broke the breech of that over my head. He\r\nthen seized up the fire-tongs and struck me over the head ever so often.\r\nThe next thing he took was the parlor shovel and he beat on me with that\r\ntill he broke the handle; then he took the blade and stove it at my head\r\nwith all his might. I told him that I was bound to come out of that\r\nroom. He run up to the door and drawed his knife and told me if I\r\nventured to the door he would stab me. I never made it any better or\r\nworse, but aimed straight for the door; but before I reached it he\r\nstabbed me, drawing the knife (a common pocket knife) as hard as he\r\ncould rip across my stomach; right away he began stabbing me about my\r\nhead,\" (marks were plainly to be seen). After a desperate struggle,\r\nTheophilus succeeded in getting out of the building.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n\"I started,\" said he, \"at once for Georgetown, carrying a part of my\r\nentrails in my hands for the whole journey, sixteen miles. I went to my\r\nyoung masters, and they took me to an old colored woman, called Judah\r\nSmith, and for five days and nights I was under treatment of Dr. Henry\r\nMoore, Dr. Charles Henry Richards, and Dr. William Newall; all these\r\nattended me. I was not expected to live for a long time, but the Doctors\r\ncured me at last.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew reported that he fled from Dr. David Houston. \"I left because of\r\nmy master's meanness to me; he was a very mean man to his servants,\"\r\nsaid Andrew, \"and I got so tired of him I couldn't stand him any\r\nlonger.\" Andrew was about twenty-six years of age, ordinary size; color,\r\nbrown, and was entitled to his freedom, but knew not how to secure it by\r\nlaw, so resorted to the Underground Rail Road method.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHandy, another of this party, said that he left because the man who\r\nclaimed to be his master \"was so hard.\" The man by whom he had been\r\nwronged was known where he came from by the name of Shepherd Burton, and\r\nwas in the farming business. \"He was a churchman,\" said Handy, \"but he\r\nnever allowed me to go to church a half dozen times in my life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert belonged to Mrs. Mary Hickman, at least she had him in her\r\npossession and reaped the benefit of his hire and enjoyed the leisure\r\nand ease thereof while he toiled. For some time prior to his leaving,\r\nthis had been a thorn in his side, hard to bear; so when an opening\r\npresented itself by which he thought he could better his condition, he\r\nwas ready to try the experiment. He, however, felt that, while she would\r\nnot have him to look to for support, she would not be without sympathy,\r\nas she was a member of the Episcopal Church; besides she was an\r\nold-looking woman and might not need his help a great while longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM RICHMOND, 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEPNEY BROWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nStepney was an extraordinary man, his countenance indicating great\r\ngoodness of heart, and his gratitude to his heavenly Father for his\r\ndeliverance proved that he was fully aware of the Source whence his help\r\nhad come. Being a man of excellent natural gifts, as well as of\r\nreligious fervor and devotion to a remarkable degree, he seemed\r\nadmirably fitted to represent the slave in chains, looking up to God\r\nwith an eye of faith, and again the fugitive in Canada triumphant and\r\nrejoicing with joy unspeakable over his deliverance, yet not forgetting\r\nthose in bonds, as bound with them. The beauty of an unshaken faith in\r\nthe good Father above could scarcely have shone with a brighter lustre\r\nthan was seen in this simple-hearted believer.\r\n\r\nStepney was thirty-four years of age, tall, slender, and of a dark hue.\r\nHe readily confessed that he fled from Mrs. Julia A. Mitchell, of\r\nRichmond; and testified that she was decidedly stingy and unkind,\r\nalthough a member of St. Paul's church. Still he was wholly free from\r\nacrimony, and even in recounting his sufferings was filled with charity\r\ntowards his oppressors. He said, \"I was moved to leave because I\r\nbelieved that I had a right to be a free man.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a member of the Second Baptist church, and entertained strong\r\nfaith that certain infirmities, which had followed him through life up\r\nto within seven years of the time of his escape, had all been removed\r\nthrough the Spirit of the Lord. He had been an eye-witness to many\r\noutrages inflicted on his fellow-men. But he spoke more of the\r\nsufferings of others than his own.\r\n\r\nHis stay was brief, but interesting. After his arrival in Canada he\r\nturned his attention to industrial pursuits, and cherished his loved\r\nidea that the Lord was very good to him. Occasionally he would write to\r\nexpress his gratitude to God and man, and to inquire about friends in\r\ndifferent localities, especially those in bonds.\r\n\r\nThe following letters are specimens, and speak for themselves:\r\n\r\n\r\n    CLIFTON HOUSE, NIAGARA FALLS, August the 27.\r\n\r\n    DEAR BROTHER:--It is with pleasure i take my pen in hand to\r\n    write a few lines to inform you that i am well hopeping these\r\n    few lines may fine you the same i am longing to hear from you\r\n    and your family i wish you would say to Julis Anderson that he\r\n    must realy excuse me for not writing but i am in hopes that he\r\n    is doing well. i have not heard no news from Virgina. plese to\r\n    send me all the news say to Mrs. Hunt an you also forever pray\r\n    for me knowing that God is so good to us. i have not seen\r\n    brother John Dungy for 5 months, but we have corresponded\r\n    together but he is doing well in Brandford. i am now at the\r\n    falls an have been on here some time an i shall with the help of\r\n    the lord locate myself somewhere this winter an go to school\r\n    excuse me for not annser your letter sooner knowing that i\r\n    cannot write well you please to send me one of the earliest\r\n    papers send me word if any of our friends have been passing\r\n    through i know that you are very busy but ask your little\r\n    daughter if she will annser this letter for you i often feel\r\n    that i cannot turn god thanks enough for his blessings that he\r\n    has bestoueth upon me.

Samuel Green had been convicted and sent to the penitentiary\r\nfor ten years for having a copy of Uncle Tom's Cabin in his humble home;\r\nwhere so many parties, on escaping, had the good sense and courage to\r\nsecure their flight by bringing their masters' horses and carriages a\r\ngood way on their perilous journey.\r\n\r\nSam had been tied up and beat many times severely. William had been\r\nstripped naked, and frequently and cruelly cowhided. Thomas had been\r\nclubbed over his head more times than a few. Jim had been whipped with\r\nclubs and switches times without number. Charles had had five men on him\r\nat one time, with cowhides, his master in the lead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Heath had had his head cut shockingly, with a club, in the hands\r\nof his master; this well cared-for individual in referring to his kind\r\nmaster, said: \"I can give his character right along, he was a perfect\r\ndevil. The night we left, he had a woman tied up--God knows what he\r\ndone. He was always blustering, you could never do enough for him no\r\nhow. First thing in the morning and last thing at night, you would hear\r\nhim cussing--he would cuss in bed. He was a large farmer, all the time\r\ndrunk. He had a good deal of money but not much character. He was a\r\nsavage, bluff, red face-looking concern.\" Thus, in the most earnest, as\r\nwell as in an intelligent manner, Charles described the man (Aquila\r\nCain), who had hitherto held him under the yoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames left his mother, Nancy Kell, two brothers, Robert and Henry, and\r\ntwo sisters, Mary and Annie; all living in the neighborhood whence he\r\nfled. Besides these, he had eight brothers and sisters living in\r\nBaltimore and elsewhere, under the yoke. He was twenty-four years of\r\nage, of a jet color, but of a manly turn. He fled from Thomas Murphy, a\r\nfarmer, and regular slave-holder. Charles Heath was twenty-five years of\r\nage, medium size, full black, a very keen-looking individual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam was also of unmixed blood, shrewd and wide-awake for his\r\nyears,--had been ground down under the heel of Aquila Cain. He left his\r\nmother and two sisters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Ringgold was eighteen years of age; no white blood showed itself\r\nin the least in this individual. He fled from Dr. Jacob Preston, a\r\nmember of the Episcopal Church, and a practical farmer with twenty head\r\nof slaves. \"He was not so bad, but his wife was said to be a 'stinger.'\"\r\nCharles left his mother and father behind, also four sisters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas was of pure blood, with a very cheerful, healthy-looking\r\ncountenance,--twenty-one years of age, and was to \"come free\" at\r\ntwenty-five, but he had too much good sense to rely upon the promises of\r\nslave-holders in matters of this kind. He too belonged to Cain who, he\r\nsaid, was constantly talking about selling, etc. He left his father and\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nAfter being furnished with food, clothing, and free tickets, they were\r\nforwarded on in triumph and full of hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDRY ARRIVALS, 1859.\r\n\r\nJOHN EDWARD LEE, JOHN HILLIS, CHARLES ROSS, JAMES RYAN, WILLIAM\r\nJOHNSTON, EDWARD WOOD, CORNELIUS FULLER AND HIS WIFE HARRIET, JOHN\r\nPINKET, ANSAL CANNON, AND JAMES BROWN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn came from Maryland, and brought with him a good degree of pluck. He\r\nsatisfied the Committee that he fully believed in freedom, and had\r\nproved his faith by his works, as he came in contact with pursuers, whom\r\nhe put to flight by the use of an ugly-looking knife, which he plunged\r\ninto one of them, producing quite a panic; the result was that he was\r\nleft to pursue his Underground Rail Road journey without further\r\nmolestation. There was nothing in John's appearance which would lead one\r\nto suppose that he was a blood-thirsty or bad man, although a man of\r\nuncommon muscular powers; six feet high, and quite black, with\r\nresolution stamped on his countenance. But when he explained how he was\r\nenslaved by a man named John B. Slade, of Harford Co., and how, in some\r\nway or other, he became entitled to his freedom, and just as the time\r\narrived for the consummation of his long prayed-for boon, said Slade was\r\nabout to sell him,--after this provocation, it was clear enough to\r\nperceive how John came to use his knife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Hillis was a tiller of the ground under a widow lady (Mrs. Louisa\r\nLe Count), of the New Market District, Maryland. He signified to the\r\nmistress, that he loved to follow the water, and that he would be just\r\nas safe on water as on land, and that he was discontented. The widow\r\nheard John's plausible story, and saw nothing amiss in it, so she\r\nconsented that he should work on a schooner. The name of the craft was\r\n\"Majestic.\" The hopeful John endeavored to do his utmost to please, and\r\nwas doubly happy when he learned that the \"Majestic\" was to make a trip\r\nto Philadelphia. On arriving John's eyes were opened to see that he owed\r\nMrs. Le Count nothing, but that she was largely indebted to him for\r\nyears of unrequited toil; he could not, therefore, consent to go back to\r\nher. He was troubled to think of his poor wife and children, whom he had\r\nleft in the hands of Mrs. Harriet Dean, three quarters of a mile from\r\nNew Market; but it was easier for him to imagine plans by which he could\r\nget them off than to incur the hazard of going back to Maryland;\r\ntherefore he remained in freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Ross was clearly of the opinion that he was free-born, but that\r\nhe had been illegally held in Slavery, as were all his brothers and\r\nsisters, by a man named Rodgers, a farmer, living near Greensborough, in\r\nCaroline county, Md. Very good reasons were given by Charles for the\r\ncharge which he made against Rodgers, and it went far towards\r\nestablishing the fact, that \"colored men had no rights which white men\r\nwere bound to respect,\" in Maryland. Although he was only twenty-three\r\nyears of age, he had fully weighed the matter of his freedom, and\r\nappeared firmly set against Slavery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Johnson was owned by a man named John Bosley, a farmer, living\r\nnear Gun Powder Neck, Maryland. One morning he, unexpectedly to William,\r\ngave him a terrible cowhiding, which, contrary to the master's designs,\r\nmade him a firm believer in the doctrine of immediate abolition, and he\r\nthought, that from that hour he must do something against the system--if\r\nnothing more than to go to Canada. This determination was so strong,\r\nthat in a few weeks afterwards he found himself on the Underground Rail\r\nRoad. He left one brother and one sister; his mother was dead, and of\r\nhis father's whereabouts he knew nothing. William was nineteen years of\r\nage, brown color, smart and good-looking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward Wood was a \"chattel\" from Drummerstown, Accomac county, Virginia,\r\nwhere he had been owned by a farmer, calling himself James White; a man\r\nwho \"drank hard and was very crabbed,\" and before Edward left owned\r\neleven head of slaves. Edward left a wife and three children, but the\r\nstrong desire to be free, which had been a ruling passion of his being\r\nfrom early boyhood, rendered it impossible for him to stay, although the\r\nties were very hard to break. Slavery was crushing him hourly, and he\r\nfelt that he could not submit any longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCornelius Fuller, and his wife, Harriet, escaped together from Kent\r\ncounty, Maryland. They belonged to separate masters; Cornelius, it was\r\nsaid, belonged to the Diden Estate; his wife to Judge Chambers, whose\r\nHonor lived in Chestertown. \"He is no man for freedom, bless you,\" said\r\nHarriet. \"He owned more slaves than any other man in that part of the\r\ncountry; he sells sometimes, and he hired out a great many; would hire\r\nthem to any kind of a master, if he half killed you.\" Cornelius and\r\nHarriet were obliged to leave their daughter Kitty, who was thirteen\r\nyears of age.\r\n\r\nJohn Pinket and Ansal Cannon took the Underground Rail Road cars at New\r\nMarket, Dorchester county, Maryland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn was a tall young man, of twenty-seven years of age, of an active\r\nturn of mind and of a fine black color. He was the property of Mary\r\nBrown, a widow, firmly grounded in the love of Slavery; believing that a\r\nslave had no business to get tired or desire his freedom. She sold one\r\nof John's sisters to Georgia, and before John fled, had still in her\r\npossession nine head of slaves. She was a member of the Methodist church\r\nat East New Market. From certain movements which looked very suspicious\r\nin John's eyes, he had been allotted to the Southern Market, he\r\ntherefore resolved to look out for a habitation in Canada. He had a\r\nfirst-rate corn-field education, but no book learning. Up to the time of\r\nhis escape, John had shunned entangling himself with a wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnsal was twenty-five years of age, well-colored, and seemed like a\r\ngood-natured and well-behaved article. He escaped from Kitty Cannon,\r\nanother widow, who owned nine chattels. \"Sometimes she treated her\r\nslaves pretty well,\" was the testimony of Ansal. He ran away because he\r\ndid not get pay for his services. In thus being deprived of his hire, he\r\nconcluded that he had no business to stay if he could get away.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND, 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES BROWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nA more giant-like looking passenger than the above named individual had\r\nrarely ever passed over the road. He was six feet three inches high, and\r\nin every respect, a man of bone, sinew and muscle. For one who had\r\nenjoyed only a field hand's privileges for improvement, he was not to be\r\ndespised.\r\n\r\nJim owed service to Henry Jones; at least he admitted that said Jones\r\nclaimed him, and had hired him out to himself for seven dollars per\r\nmonth. While this amount seemed light, it was much heavier than Jim felt\r\nwilling to meet solely for his master's benefit. After giving some heed\r\nto the voice of freedom within, he considered that it behooved him to\r\ntry and make his way to some place where men were not guilty of wronging\r\ntheir neighbors out of their just hire. Having heard of the Underground\r\nRail Road running to Canada, he concluded to take a trip and see the\r\ncountry, for himself; so he arranged his affairs with this end in view,\r\nand left Henry Jones with one less to work for him for nothing. The\r\nplace that he fled from was called North Point, Baltimore county. The\r\nnumber of fellow-slaves left in the hands of his old master, was\r\nfifteen.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM DELAWARE, 1859.\r\n\r\nEDWARD, JOHN, AND CHARLES HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above named individuals were brothers from Delaware. They were\r\nyoung; the eldest being about twenty, the youngest not far from\r\nseventeen years of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward was serving on a farm, under a man named Booth. Perceiving that\r\nBooth was \"running through his property\" very fast by hard drinking,\r\nEdward's better judgment admonished him that his so-called master would\r\none day have need of more rum money, and that he might not be too good\r\nto offer him in the market for what he would bring. Charles resolved\r\nthat when his brothers crossed the line dividing Delaware and\r\nPennsylvania, he would not be far behind.\r\n\r\nThe mother of these boys was freed at the age of twenty-eight, and lived\r\nin Wilmington, Delaware. It was owing to the fact that their mother had\r\nbeen freed that they entertained the vague notion that they too might be\r\nfreed; but it was a well established fact that thousands lived and died\r\nin such a hope without ever realizing their expectations. The boys, more\r\nshrewd and wide awake than many others, did not hearken to such \"stuff.\"\r\nThe two younger heard the views of the elder brother, and expressed a\r\nwillingness to follow him. Edward, becoming satisfied that what they\r\nmeant to do must be done quickly, took the lead, and off they started\r\nfor a free State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn was owned by one James B. Rodgers, a farmer, and \"a most every kind\r\nof man,\" as John expressed himself; in fact John thought that his owner\r\nwas such a strange, wicked, and cross character that he couldn't tell\r\nhimself what he was. Seeing that slaves were treated no better than dogs\r\nand hogs, John thought that he was none too young to be taking steps to\r\nget away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles was held by James Rodgers, Sr., under whom he said that he had\r\nserved nine years with faint prospects of some time becoming free, but\r\nwhen, was doubtful.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM VIRGINIA, 1859.\r\n\r\nJAMES TAYLOR, ALBERT GROSS, AND JOHN GRINAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo see mere lads, not twenty-one years of age, smart enough to outwit\r\nthe very shrewdest and wisest slave-holders of Virginia was very\r\ngratifying. The young men composing this arrival were of this\r\nkeen-sighted order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames was only a little turned of twenty, of a yellow complexion, and\r\nintelligent. A trader, by the name of George Ailer, professed to own\r\nJames. He said that he had been used tolerable well, not so bad as many\r\nhad been used. James was learning the carpenter trade; but he was\r\nanxious to obtain his freedom, and finding his two companions true on\r\nthe main question, in conjunction with them he contrived a plan of\r\nescape, and 'took out.' His father and mother, Harrison and Jane Taylor,\r\nwere left at Fredericksburg to mourn the absence of their son.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbert was in his twentieth year, the picture of good health, not homely\r\nby any means, although not of a fashionable color. He was under the\r\npatriarchal protection of a man by the name of William Price, who\r\ncarried on farming in Cecil county, Maryland. Albert testified that he\r\nwas a bad man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Grinage was only twenty, a sprightly, active young man, of a brown\r\ncolor. He came from Middle Neck, Cecil county, where he had served under\r\nWilliam Flintham, a farmer.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDRY ARRIVALS FROM MARYLAND (1859)\r\n\r\n\r\nAND OTHER PLACES.\r\n\r\nJAMES ANDY WILKINS, and wife LUCINDA, with their little boy, CHARLES,\r\nCHARLES HENRY GROSS, A WOMAN with her TWO CHILDREN--one in her\r\narms--JOHN BROWN, JOHN ROACH, and wife LAMBY, and HENRY SMALLWOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above-named passengers did not all come from the same place, or\r\nexactly at the same time; but for the sake of convenience they are thus\r\nembraced under a general head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Andy Wilkins \"gave the slip\" to a farmer, by the name of George\r\nBiddle, who lived one mile from Cecil, Cecil county, Maryland. While he\r\nhated Slavery, he took a favorable view of his master in some respects\r\nat least, as he said that he was a \"moderate man in talk;\" but \"sly in\r\naction.\" His master provided him with two pairs of pantaloons in the\r\nsummer, and one in the winter, also a winter jacket, no vest, no cap, or\r\nhat. James thought the sum total for the entire year's clothing would\r\nnot amount to more than ten dollars. Sunday clothing he was compelled to\r\nprocure for himself by working of nights; he made axe handles, mats,\r\netc., of evenings, and caught musk rats on Sunday, and availed himself\r\nof their hides to procure means for his most pressing wants. Besides\r\nthese liberal privileges his master was in the habit of allowing him two\r\nwhole days every harvest, and at Christmas from twenty-five cents to as\r\nhigh as three dollars and fifty cents, were lavished upon him.\r\n\r\nHis master was a bachelor, a man of considerable means, and \"kept\r\ntolerable good company,\" and only owned two other slaves, Rachel Ann\r\nDumbson and John Price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLucinda, the companion of James, was twenty-one years of age,\r\ngood-looking, well-formed and of a brown color. She spoke of a man named\r\nGeorge Ford as her owner. He, however, was said to be of the \"moderate\r\nclass\" of slave-holders; Lucinda being the only slave property he\r\npossessed, and she came to him through his wife (who was a Methodist).\r\nThe master was an outsider, so far as the Church was concerned. Once in\r\na great while Lucinda was allowed to go to church, when she could be\r\nspared from her daily routine of cooking, washing, etc. Twice a week she\r\nwas permitted the special favor of seeing her husband. These simple\r\nprivations not being of a grave character, no serious fault was found\r\nwith them; yet Lucinda was not without a strong ground of complaint. Not\r\nlong before escaping, she had been threatened with the auction-block;\r\nthis fate she felt bound to avert, if possible, and the way she aimed to\r\ndo it was by escaping on the Underground Rail Road. Charley, a bright\r\nlittle fellow only three years of age, was \"contented and happy\" enough.\r\nLucinda left her father, Moses Edgar Wright, and two brothers, both\r\nslaves. One belonged to \"Francis Crookshanks,\" and the other to Capt.\r\nJim Mitchell. Her mother, who was known by the name of Betsy Wright,\r\nescaped when she (Lucinda) was seven years of age. Of her whereabouts\r\nnothing further had ever been heard. Lucinda entertained strong hopes\r\nthat she might find her in Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Henry Gross began life in Maryland, and was made to bear the\r\nheat and burden of the day in Baltimore, under Henry Slaughter,\r\nproprietor of the Ariel Steamer. Owing to hard treatment, Charles was\r\ninduced to fly to Canada for refuge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA woman with two children, one in her arms, and the other two years of\r\nage (names, etc., not recorded), came from the District of Columbia.\r\nMother and children, appealed loudly for sympathy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Brown, being at the beck of a man filling the situation of a common\r\nclerk (in the shoe store of McGrunders), became dissatisfied. Asking\r\nhimself what right Benjamin Thorn (his professed master) had to his\r\nhire, he was led to see the injustice of his master, and made up his\r\nmind, that he would leave by the first train, if he could get a genuine\r\nticket _viâ_ the Underground Rail Road. He found an agent and soon had\r\nmatters all fixed. He left his father, mother and seven sisters and one\r\nbrother, all slaves. John was a man small of stature, dark, with homely\r\nfeatures, but he was very determined to get away from oppression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn and Lamby Roach had been eating bitter bread under bondage near\r\nSeaford. John was the so-called property of Joshua O'Bear, \"a fractious,\r\nhard-swearing man, and when mad would hit one of his slaves with\r\nanything he could get in his hands.\" John and his companion made the\r\nlong journey on foot. The former had been trained to farm labor and the\r\ncommon drudgery of slave life. Being a man of thirty-three years of age,\r\nwith more than ordinary abilities, he had given the matter of his\r\nbondage considerable thought, and seeing that his master \"got worse the\r\nolder he got,\" together with the fact, that his wife had recently been\r\nsold, he was strongly stirred to make an effort for Canada. While it was\r\na fact, that his wife had already been sold, as above stated, the change\r\nof ownership was not to take place for some months, consequently John\r\n\"took out in a hurry.\" His wife was the property of Dr. Shipley, of\r\nSeaford, who had occasion to raise some money for which he gave security\r\nin the shape of this wife and mother. Horsey was the name of the\r\ngentleman from whom it was said that he obtained the favor; so when the\r\ntime was up for the payment to be made, the Dr. was not prepared.\r\nHorsey, therefore, claimed the collateral (the wife) and thus she had to\r\nmeet the issue, or make a timely escape to Canada with her husband. No\r\nway but walking was open to them. Deciding to come this way, they\r\nprosecuted their journey with uncommon perseverance and success. Both\r\nwere comforted by strong faith in God, and believed that He would enable\r\nthem to hold out on the road until they should reach friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Smallwood saw that he was working every day for nothing, and\r\nthought that he would do better. He described his master (Washington\r\nBonafont) as a sort of a rowdy, who drank pretty hard, leaving a very\r\nunfavorable impression on Henry's mind, as he felt almost sure such\r\nconduct would lead to a sale at no distant day. So he was cautious\r\nenough to \"take the hint in time.\" Henry left in company with nine\r\nothers; but after being two days on the journey they were routed and\r\nseparated by their pursuers. At this point Henry lost all trace of the\r\nrest. He heard afterwards that two of them had been captured, but\r\nreceived no further tidings of the others. Henry was a fine\r\nrepresentative for Canada; a tall, dark, and manly-looking individual,\r\nthirty-six years of age. He left his father and mother behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM RICHMOND, 1859.\r\n\r\nHENRY JONES AND TURNER FOSTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry was left free by the will of his mistress (Elizabeth Mann), but\r\nthe heirs were making desperate efforts to overturn this instrument. Of\r\nthis, there was so much danger with a Richmond court, that Henry feared\r\nthat the chances were against him; that the court was not honest enough\r\nto do him justice. Being a man of marked native foresight, he concluded\r\nthat the less he talked about freedom and the more he acted the sooner\r\nhe would be out of his difficulties. He was called upon, however, to\r\nsettle certain minor matters, before he could see his way clear to move\r\nin the direction of Canada; for instance, he had a wife on his mind to\r\ndispose of in some way, but how he could not tell. Again, he was not in\r\nthe secret of the Underground Rail Road movement; he knew that many got\r\noff, but how they managed it he was ignorant. If he could settle these\r\ntwo points satisfactorily, he thought that he would be willing to endure\r\nany sacrifice for the sake of his freedom. He found an agent of the\r\nUnderground Rail Road, and after surmounting various difficulties, this\r\npoint was settled. As good luck would have it, his wife, who was a free\r\nwoman, although she heard the secret with great sorrow, had the good\r\nsense to regard his step for the best, and thus he was free to contend\r\nwith all other dangers on the way.\r\n\r\nHe encountered the usual suffering, and on his arrival experienced the\r\nwonted pleasure. He was a man of forty-one years of age, spare made,\r\nwith straight hair, and Indian complexion, with the Indian's aversion to\r\nSlavery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTurner, who was a fellow-passenger with Henry, arrived also from\r\nRichmond. He was about twenty-one, a bright, smart, prepossessing young\r\nman. He fled from A.A. Mosen, a lawyer, represented to be one of the\r\nfirst in the city, and a firm believer in Slavery. Turner differed\r\nwidely with his master with reference to this question, although, for\r\nprudential reasons, he chose not to give his opinion to said Mosen.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO YOUNG MOTHERS, EACH WITH BABES IN THEIR ARMS--ANNA ELIZABETH YOUNG\r\nAND SARAH JANE BELL--WHIPPED TILL THE BLOOD FLOWED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appearance of these young mothers at first produced a sudden degree\r\nof pleasure, but their story of suffering quite as suddenly caused the\r\nmost painful reflections. It was hardly possible to listen to their\r\ntales of outrage and wrong with composure. Both came from Kent county,\r\nMaryland, and reported that they fled from a man by the name of Massey;\r\na man of low stature, light-complexioned, with dark hair, dark eyes, and\r\nvery quick temper; given to hard swearing as a common practice; also,\r\nthat the said Massey had a wife, who was a very tall woman, with blue\r\neyes, chestnut-colored hair, and a very bad temper; that, conjointly,\r\nMassey and his wife were in the habit of meting out cruel punishment to\r\ntheir slaves, without regard to age or sex, and that they themselves,\r\n(Anna Elizabeth and Sarah Jane), had received repeated scourgings at the\r\nhands of their master. Anna and Sarah were respectively twenty-four and\r\ntwenty-five years of age; Anna was of a dark chestnut color, while Sarah\r\nwas two shades lighter; both had good manners, and a fair share of\r\nintelligence, which afforded a hopeful future for them in freedom. Each\r\nhad a babe in her arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah had been a married woman for three years; her child, a boy, was\r\neight months old, and was named Garrett Bell. Elizabeth's child was a\r\ngirl, nineteen months old, and named Sarah Catharine Young. Elizabeth\r\nhad never been married. They had lived with Massey five years up to the\r\nlast March prior to their escape, having been bought out of the\r\nBaltimore slave-pen, with the understanding that they were to be free at\r\nthe expiration of five years' service under him. The five years had more\r\nthan expired, but no hope or sign of freedom appeared. On the other\r\nhand, Massey was talking loudly of selling them again. Threats and fears\r\nwere so horrifying to them, that they could not stand it; this was what\r\nprompted them to flee. \"As often as six or seven times,\" said Elizabeth,\r\n\"I have been whipped by master, once with the carriage whip, and at\r\nother times with a raw hide trace. The last flogging I received from\r\nhim, was about four weeks before last Christmas; he then tied me up to a\r\nlocust tree standing before the door, and whipped me to his\r\nsatisfaction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah had fared no better than Elizabeth, according to her testimony.\r\n\"Three times,\" said she, \"I have been tied up; the last time was in\r\nplanting corn-time, this year. My clothing was all stripped off above my\r\nwaist, and then he whipped me till the blood ran down to my heels.\" Her\r\nback was lacerated all over. She had been ploughing with two horses, and\r\nunfortunately had lost a hook out of her plough; this, she declared was\r\nthe head and front of her offending, nothing more. Thus, after all their\r\nsuffering, utterly penniless, they reached the Committee, and were in\r\nevery respect, in a situation to call for the deepest commiseration.\r\nThey were helped and were thankful.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND, VIRGINIA, AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.\r\n\r\nJOHN WESLEY SMITH, ROBERT MURRAY, SUSAN STEWART, AND JOSEPHINE SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaniel Hubert was fattening on John Wesley's earnings contrary to his,\r\nJohn's, idea of right. For a long time John failed to see the remedy,\r\nbut as he grew older and wiser the scales fell from his eyes and he\r\nperceived that the Underground Rail Road ran near his master's place,\r\nCambridge, Md., and by a very little effort and a large degree of\r\ncourage and perseverance he might manage to get out of Maryland and on\r\nto Canada, where slave-holders had no more rights than other people.\r\nThese reflections came seriously into John's mind at about the age of\r\ntwenty-six; being about this time threatened with the auction-block he\r\nbade slavery good-night, jumped into the Underground Rail Road car and\r\noff he hurried for Pennsylvania. His mother, Betsy, one brother, and one\r\nsister were left in the hands of Hubert. John Wesley could pray for them\r\nand wish them well, but nothing more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert Murray became troubled in mind about his freedom while living in\r\nLondon county, Virginia, under the heel of Eliza Brooks, a widow woman,\r\nwho used him bad, according to his testimony. He had been \"knocked about\r\na good deal.\" A short while before he fled, he stated that he had been\r\nbeat brutally, so much so that the idea of escape was beat into him. He\r\nhad never before felt as if he dared hope to try to get out of bondage,\r\nbut since then his mind had undergone such a sudden and powerful change,\r\nhe began to feel that nothing could hold him in Virginia; the place\r\nbecame hateful to him. He looked upon a slave-holder as a kind of a\r\nliving, walking, talking \"Satan, going about as a roaring lion seeking\r\nwhom he may destroy.\" He left his wife, with one child; her name was\r\nNancy Jane, and the name of the offspring was Elizabeth. As Robert had\r\npossessed but rare privileges to visit his wife, he felt it less a trial\r\nto leave than if it had been otherwise. William Seedam owned the wife\r\nand child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan Stewart and Josephine Smith fled together from the District of\r\nColumbia. Running away had been for a long time a favorite idea with\r\nSusan, as she had suffered much at the hands of different masters. The\r\nmain cause of her flight was to keep from being sold again; for she had\r\nbeen recently threatened by Henry Harley, who \"followed droving,\" and\r\nnot being rich, at any time when he might be in want of money she felt\r\nthat she might have to go. When a girl only twelve years of age, her\r\nyoung mind strongly revolted against being a slave, and at that youthful\r\nperiod she tried her fortune at running away. While she was never caught\r\nby her owners, she had the misfortune to fall into the hands of another\r\nslaveholder no better than her old master, indeed she thought that she\r\nfound it even worse under him, so far as severe floggings were\r\nconcerned. Susan was of a bright brown color, medium size, quick and\r\nactive intellectually and physically, and although she had suffered much\r\nfrom Slavery, as she was not far advanced in years, she might still do\r\nsomething for herself. She left no near kin that she was aware of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJosephine fled from Miss Anna Maria Warren, who had previously been\r\nderanged from the effects of paralysis. Josephine regarded this period\r\nof her mistress' sickness as her opportunity for planning to get away\r\nbefore her mistress came to her senses.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDRY ARRIVALS FROM MARYLAND AND VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\nHENRY FIELDS, CHARLES RINGGOLD, WILLIAM RINGGOLD, ISAAC NEWTON AND\r\nJOSEPH THOMAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[\"Five other cases were attended to by Dillwyn Parish and J.C.\r\nWhite\"--other than this no note was made of them.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Fields took the benefit of the Underground Rail Road at the age of\r\neighteen. He fled from the neighborhood of Port Deposit while being\r\n\"broke in\" by a man named Washington Glasby, who was wicked enough to\r\nclaim him as his property, and was also about to sell him. This chattel\r\nwas of a light yellow complexion, hearty-looking and wide awake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Ringgold took offence at being whipped like a dog, and the\r\nprospect of being sold further South; consequently in a high state of\r\nmental dread of the peculiar institution, he concluded that freedom was\r\nworth suffering for, and although he was as yet under twenty years of\r\nage, he determined not to remain in Perrymanville, Maryland, to wear the\r\nchains of Slavery for the especial benefit of his slave-holding master\r\n(whose name was inadvertently omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Ringgold fled from Henry Wallace, of Baltimore. A part of the\r\ntime William said he \"had had it pretty rough, and a part of the time\r\nkinder smooth,\" but never had had matters to his satisfaction. Just\r\nbefore deciding to make an adventure on the Underground Rail Road his\r\nowner had been talking of selling him. Under the apprehension that this\r\nthreat would prove no joke, Henry began to study what he had better do\r\nto be saved from the jaws of hungry negro traders. It was not long\r\nbefore he came to the conclusion that he had best strike out upon a\r\nventure in a Northern direction, and do the best he could to get as far\r\naway as possible from the impending danger threatened by Mr. Wallace.\r\nAfter a long and weary travel on foot by night, he found himself at\r\nColumbia, where friends of the Underground Rail Road assisted him on to\r\nPhiladelphia. Here his necessary wants were met, and directions given\r\nhim how to reach the land of refuge, where he would be out of the way of\r\nall slave-holders and slave-traders. Six of his brothers had been sold;\r\nhis mother was still in bondage in Baltimore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIsaac Newton hailed from Richmond, Virginia. He professed to be only\r\nthirty years of age, but he seemed to be much older. While he had had an\r\neasy time in slavery, he preferred that his master should work for\r\nhimself, as he felt that it was his bounden duty to look after number\r\none; so he did not hesitate about leaving his situation vacant for any\r\none who might desire it, whether white or black, but made a successful\r\n\"took out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph Thomas was doing the work of a so-called master in Prince\r\nGeorge's county, Maryland. For some cause or other the alarm of the\r\nauction-block was sounded in his ears, which at first distracted him\r\ngreatly; upon sober reflection it worked greatly to his advantage. It\r\nset him to thinking seriously on the subject of immediate emancipation,\r\nand what a miserable hard lot of it he should have through life if he\r\ndid not \"pick up\" courage and resolution to get beyond the terror of\r\nslave-holders; so under these reflections he found his nerves gathering\r\nstrength, his fears leaving him, and he was ready to venture on the\r\nUnderground Rail Road. He came through without any serious difficulty.\r\nHe left his father and mother, Shadrach and Lucinda Thomas.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM SEAFORD, 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT BELL AND TWO OTHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert came from Seaford, where he had served under Charles Wright, a\r\nfarmer, of considerable means, and the owner of a number of slaves, over\r\nwhom he was accustomed to rule with much rigor.\r\n\r\nAlthough Robert's master had a wife and five children, the love which\r\nRobert bore them was too weak to hold him; and well adapted as the\r\nsystem of Slavery might be to render him happy in the service of young\r\nand old masters, it was insufficient for him. Robert found no rest under\r\nMr. Wright; no privileges, scantily clad, poor food, and a heavy yoke,\r\nwas the policy of this \"superior.\" Robert testified, that for the last\r\nfive years, matters had been growing worse and worse; that times had\r\nnever been so bad before. Of nights, under the new regime, the slaves\r\nwere locked up and not allowed to go anywhere; flogging, selling, etc.,\r\nwere of every-day occurrence throughout the neighborhood. Finally,\r\nRobert became sick of such treatment, and he found that the spirit of\r\nCanada and freedom was uppermost in his heart. Slavery grew blacker and\r\nblacker, until he resolved to \"pull up stakes\" upon a venture. The\r\nmotion was right, and succeeded.\r\n\r\nTwo other passengers were at the station at the same time, but they had\r\nto be forwarded without being otherwise noticed on the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM TAPPS' NECK, MD., 1859.\r\n\r\nLEWIS WILSON, JOHN WATERS, ALFRED EDWARDS AND WILLIAM QUINN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLewis' grey hairs signified that he had been for many years plodding\r\nunder the yoke. He was about fifty years of age, well set, not tall, but\r\nhe had about him the marks of a substantial laborer. He had been brought\r\nup on a farm under H. Lynch, whom Lewis described as \"a mean man when\r\ndrunk, and very severe on his slaves.\" The number that he ruled over as\r\nhis property, was about twenty. Said Lewis, about two years ago, he shot\r\na free man, and the man died about two hours afterwards; for this\r\noffence he was not even imprisoned. Lynch also tried to cut the throat\r\nof John Waters, and succeeded in making a frightful gash on his left\r\nshoulder (mark shown), which mark he will carry with him to the grave;\r\nfor this he was not even sued. Lewis left five children in bondage,\r\nHorace, John, Georgiana, Louisa and Louis, Jr., owned by Bazil and John\r\nBenson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn was forty years of age, dark, medium size, and another of Lynch's\r\n\"articles.\" He left his wife Anna, but no children; it was hard to leave\r\nher, but he felt that it would be still harder to live and die under the\r\nusage that he had experienced on Lynch's farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlfred was twenty-two years of age; he was of a full dark color, and\r\nquite smart. He fled from John Bryant, a farmer. Whether he deserved it\r\nor not, Alfred gave him a bad character, at least, with regard to the\r\ntreatment of his slaves. He left his father and mother, six brothers and\r\nsisters. Traveling under doubts and fears with the thought of leaving a\r\nlarge family of his nearest and dearest friends, was far from being a\r\npleasant undertaking with Alfred, yet he bore up under the trial and\r\narrived in peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"William is twenty-two, black, tall, intelligent, and active,\" are the\r\nwords of the record.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND, 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\nANN MARIA JACKSON AND HER SEVEN CHILDREN--MARY ANN, WILLIAM HENRY,\r\nFRANCES SABRINA, WILHELMINA, JOHN EDWIN, EBENEZER THOMAS, AND WILLIAM\r\nALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coming of the above named was duly announced by Thomas Garrett:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILMINGTON, 11th mo., 21st, 1858.\r\n\r\n    DEAR FRIENDS--McKIM AND STILL:--I write to inform you that on\r\n    the 16th of this month, we passed on four able bodied men to\r\n    Pennsylvania, and they were followed last night by a woman and\r\n    her six children, from three or four years of age, up to sixteen\r\n    years, I believe the whole belonged to the same estate, and they\r\n    were to have been sold at public sale, I was informed yesterday,\r\n    but preferred seeking their own master; we had some trouble in\r\n    getting those last safe along, as they could not travel far on\r\n    foot, and could not safely cross any of the bridges on the\r\n    canal, either on foot or in carriage. A man left here two days\r\n    since, with carriage, to meet them this side of the canal, but\r\n    owing to spies they did not reach him till 10 o'clock last\r\n    night; this morning he returned, having seen them about one or\r\n    two o'clock this morning in a second carriage, on the border of\r\n    Chester county, where I think they are all safe, if they can be\r\n    kept from Philadelphia. If you see them they can tell their own\r\n    tales, as I have seen one of them. May He, who feeds the ravens,\r\n    care for them. Yours,\r\n\r\n    THOS. GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fire of freedom obviously burned with no ordinary fervor in the\r\nbreast of this slave mother, or she never would have ventured with the\r\nburden of seven children, to escape from the hell of Slavery.\r\n\r\nAnn Maria was about forty years of age, good-looking, pleasant\r\ncountenance, and of a chestnut color, height medium, and intellect above\r\nthe average. Her bearing was humble, as might have been expected, from\r\nthe fact that she emerged from the lowest depths of Delaware Slavery.\r\nDuring the Fall prior to her escape, she lost her husband under most\r\ntrying circumstances: he died in the poor-house, a raving maniac. Two of\r\nhis children had been taken from their mother by her owner, as was usual\r\nwith slave-holders, which preyed so severely on the poor father's mind\r\nthat it drove him into a state of hopeless insanity. He was a \"free man\"\r\nin the eye of Delaware laws, yet he was not allowed to exercise the\r\nleast authority over his children.\r\n\r\nPrior to the time that the two children were taken from their mother,\r\nshe had been allowed to live with her husband and children,\r\nindependently of her master, by supporting herself and them with the\r\nwhite-wash brush, wash-tub, etc. For this privilege the mother doubtless\r\nworked with double energy, and the master, in all probability, was\r\nlargely the gainer, as the children were no expense to him in their\r\ninfancy; but when they began to be old enough to hire out, or bring high\r\nprices in the market, he snatched away two of the finest articles, and\r\nthe powerless father was immediately rendered a fit subject for the\r\nmad-house; but the brave hearted mother looked up to God, resolved to\r\nwait patiently until in a good Providence the way might open to escape\r\nwith her remaining children to Canada.\r\n\r\nYear in and year out she had suffered to provide food and raiment for\r\nher little ones. Many times in going out to do days' work she would be\r\ncompelled to leave her children, not knowing whether during her absence\r\nthey would fall victims to fire, or be carried off by the master. But\r\nshe possessed a well tried faith, which in her flight kept her from\r\ndespondency. Under her former lot she scarcely murmured, but declared\r\nthat she had never been at ease in Slavery a day after the birth of her\r\nfirst-born. The desire to go to some part of the world where she could\r\nhave the control and comfort of her children, had always been a\r\nprevailing idea with her. \"It almost broke my heart,\" she said, \"when he\r\ncame and took my children away as soon as they were big enough to hand\r\nme a drink of water. My husband was always very kind to me, and I had\r\noften wanted him to run away with me and the children, but I could not\r\nget him in the notion; he did not feel that he could, and so he stayed,\r\nand died broken-hearted, crazy. I was owned by a man named Joseph Brown;\r\nhe owned property in Milford, and he had a place in Vicksburg, and some\r\nof his time he spends there, and some of the time he lives in Milford.\r\nThis Fall he said he was going to take four of my oldest children and\r\ntwo other servants to Vicksburg. I just happened to hear of this news in\r\ntime. My master was wanting to keep me in the dark about taking them,\r\nfor fear that something might happen. My master is very sly; he is a\r\ntall, slim man, with a smooth face, bald head, light hair, long and\r\nsharp nose, swears very hard, and drinks. He is a widower, and is rich.\"\r\n\r\nOn the road the poor mother, with her travel-worn children became\r\ndesperately alarmed, fearing that they were betrayed. But God had\r\nprovided better things for her; her strength and hope were soon fully\r\nrestored, and she was lucky enough to fall into the right hands. It was\r\na special pleasure to aid such a mother. Her arrival in Canada was\r\nannounced by Rev. H. Wilson as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    NIAGARA CITY, Nov. 30th, 1858.\r\n\r\n    DEAR BRO. STILL:--I am happy to inform you that Mrs. Jackson and\r\n    her interesting family of seven children arrived safe and in\r\n    good health and spirits at my house in St. Catharines, on\r\n    Saturday evening last. With sincere pleasure I provided for them\r\n    comfort quarters till this morning, when they left for Toronto.\r\n    I got them conveyed there at half fare, and gave them letters of\r\n    introduction to Thomas Henning, Esq., and Mrs. Dr. Willis,\r\n    trusting that they will be better cared for in Toronto than they\r\n    could be at St. Catharines. We have so many coming to us we\r\n    think it best for some of them to pass on to other places. My\r\n    wife gave them all a good supply of clothing before they left\r\n    us. James Henry, an older son is, I think, not far from St.\r\n    Catharine, but has not as yet reunited with the family.\r\n    Faithfully and truly yours,\r\n\r\n    HIRAM WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDRY ARRIVALS FROM VIRGINIA, MARYLAND AND DELAWARE.\r\n\r\nLEWIS LEE, ENOCH DAVIS, JOHN BROWN, THOMAS EDWARD DIXON, AND WILLIAM\r\nOLIVER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSlavery brought about many radical changes, some in one way and some in\r\nanother. Lewis Lee was entirely too white for practical purposes. They\r\ntried to get him to content himself under the yoke, but he could not see\r\nthe point. A man by the name of William Watkins, living near Fairfax,\r\nVirginia, claimed Lewis, having come by his title through marriage.\r\nTitle or no title, Lewis thought that he would not serve him for\r\nnothing, and that he had been hoodwinked already a great while longer\r\nthan he should have allowed himself to be. Watkins had managed to keep\r\nhim in the dark and doing hard work on the no-pay system up to the age\r\nof twenty-five. In Lewis' opinion, it was now time to \"strike out on his\r\nown hook;\" he took his last look of Watkins (he was a tall, slim fellow,\r\na farmer, and a hard drinker), and made the first step in the direction\r\nof the North. He was sure that he was about as white as anybody else,\r\nand that he had as good a right to pass for white as the white folks, so\r\nhe decided to do so with a high head and a fearless front. Instead of\r\nskulking in the woods, in thickets and swamps, under cover of the\r\ndarkness, he would boldly approach a hotel and call for accommodations,\r\nas any other southern gentleman. He had a little money, and he soon\r\ndiscovered that his color was perfectly orthodox. He said that he was\r\n\"treated first-rate in Washington and Baltimore;\" he could recommend\r\nboth of these cities. But destitute of education, and coming among\r\nstrangers, he was conscious that the shreds of slavery were still to be\r\nseen upon him. He had, moreover, no intention of disowning his origin\r\nwhen once he could feel safe in assuming his true status. So as he was\r\nin need of friends and material aid, he sought out the Vigilance\r\nCommittee, and on close examination they had every reason to believe his\r\nstory throughout, and gave him the usual benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnoch Davis came from within five miles of Baltimore, having been held\r\nby one James Armstrong, \"an old grey-headed man,\" and a farmer, living\r\non Huxtown Road. Judged from Davis' stand-point, the old master could\r\nnever be recommended, unless some one wanted a very hard place and a\r\nsevere master. Upon inquiry, it was ascertained that Enoch was moved to\r\nleave on account of the \"riot,\" (John Brown's Harper's Ferry raid),\r\nwhich he feared would result in the sale of a good many slaves, himself\r\namong the number; he, therefore, \"laid down the shovel and the hoe,\" and\r\nquit the place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Brown (this was an adopted name, the original one not being\r\npreserved), left to get rid of his connection with Thomas Stevens, a\r\ngrocer, living in Baltimore. John, however, did not live in the city\r\nwith said Stevens, but on the farm near Frederick's Mills, Montgomery\r\ncounty, Maryland. This place was known by the name of \"White Hall Farm;\"\r\nand was under the supervision of James Edward Stevens, a son of the\r\nabove-named Stevens. John's reasons for leaving were not noted on the\r\nbook, but his eagerness to reach Canada spoke louder than words,\r\nsignifying that the greater the distance that separated him from the old\r\n\"White Hall Farm\" the better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Edward Dixon arrived from near the Trap, in Delaware. He was only\r\nabout eighteen years of age, but as tall as a man of ordinary\r\nheight;--dark, with a pleasant countenance. He reported that he had had\r\ntrouble with a man known by the name of Thomas W.M. McCracken, who had\r\ntreated him \"bad;\" as Thomas thought that such trouble and bad treatment\r\nmight be of frequent occurrence, he concluded that he had better go away\r\nand let McCracken get somebody else to fill his place, if he did not\r\nchoose to fill it himself. So off Thomas started, and as if by instinct,\r\nhe came direct to the Committee. He passed a good examination and was\r\naided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Oliver, a dark, well-made, young man with the best of country\r\nmanners, fled from Mrs. Marshall, a lady living in Prince George's\r\ncounty, Maryland. William had recently been in the habit of hiring his\r\ntime at the rate of ten dollars per month, and find himself everything.\r\nThe privilege of living in Georgetown had been vouchsafed him, and he\r\npreferred this locality to his country situation. Upon the whole he said\r\nhe had been treated pretty well. He was, nevertheless, afraid that times\r\nwere growing \"very critical,\" and as he had a pretty good chance, he\r\nthought he had better make use of it, and his arrangements were wisely\r\nmade. He had reached his twenty-sixth year, and was apparently well\r\nsettled. He left one child, Jane Oliver, owned by Mrs. Marshall.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM DIFFERENT POINTS.\r\n\r\nJACOB BROWN, JAMES HARRIS, BENJAMIN PINEY, JOHN SMITH, ANDREW JACKSON,\r\nWILLIAM HUGHES, WESLEY WILLIAMS, ROSANNA JOHNSON, JOHN SMALLWOOD, AND\r\nHENRY TOWNSEND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJacob Brown was eating the bread of Slavery in North Carolina. A\r\nname-sake of his by the name of Lewis Brown, living in Washington,\r\naccording to the slave code of that city had Jacob in fetters, and was\r\nexercising about the same control over him that he exercised over cattle\r\nand horses. While this might have been a pleasure for the master, it was\r\npainful for the slave. The usage which Jacob had ordinarily received\r\nmade him anything but contented.\r\n\r\nAt the age of twenty, he resolved that he would run away if it cost him\r\nhis life. This purpose was made known to a captain, who was in the habit\r\nof bringing passengers from the South to Philadelphia. With an\r\nunwavering faith he took his appointed place in a private part of the\r\nvessel, and as fast as wind and tide would bring the boat he was wafted\r\non his way Canada-ward. Jacob was a dark man, and about full size, with\r\nhope large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Harris escaped from Delaware. A white woman, Catharine Odine by\r\nname, living near Middletown, claimed James as her man; but James did\r\nnot care to work for her on the unrequited labor system. He resolved to\r\ntake the first train on the Underground Rail Road that might pass that\r\nway. It was not a great while ere he was accommodated, and was brought\r\nsafely to Philadelphia. The regular examination was made and he passed\r\ncreditably. He was described in the book as a man of yellow complexion,\r\ngood-looking, and intelligent. After due assistance, he was regularly\r\nforwarded on to Canada. This was in the month of November, 1856.\r\nAfterwards nothing more was heard of him, until the receipt of the\r\nfollowing letter from Prof. L.D. Mansfield, showing that he had been\r\nreunited to his wife, under amusing, as well as touching circumstances:\r\n\r\n\r\n    AUBURN, Dec. 15th, '56.\r\n\r\n    DEAR BRO. STILL:--A very pleasant circumstance has brought you\r\n    to mind, and I am always happy to be reminded of you, and of the\r\n    very agreeable, though brief acquaintance which we made at\r\n    Philadelphia two years since. Last Thursday evening, while at my\r\n    weekly prayer meeting, our exercises were interrupted by the\r\n    appearance of Bro. Loguen, of Syracuse, who had come on with\r\n    Mrs. Harris in search of her husband, whom he had sent to my\r\n    care three weeks before. I told Bro. L. that no such man had\r\n    been at my house, and I knew nothing of him. But I dismissed the\r\n    meeting, and went with him immediately to the African Church,\r\n    where the colored brethren were holding a meeting. Bro. L.\r\n    looked through the door, and the first person whom he saw was\r\n    Harris. He was called out, when Loguen said, in a rather\r\n    reproving and excited tone, \"What are you doing here; didn't I\r\n    tell you to be off to Canada? Don't you know they are after you?\r\n    Come get your hat, and come with us, we'll take care of you.\"\r\n    The poor fellow was by this time thoroughly frightened, and\r\n    really thought he had been pursued. We conducted him nearly a\r\n    mile, to the hotel where his wife was waiting for him, leaving\r\n    him still under the impression that he was pursued and that we\r\n    were conducting him to a place of safety, or were going to box\r\n    him up to send him to Canada. Bro. L. opened the door of the\r\n    parlor, and introduced him; but he was so frightened that he did\r\n    not know his wife at first, until she called him James, when\r\n    they had a very joyful meeting. She is now a servant in my\r\n    family, and he has work, and doing well, and boards with her. We\r\n    shall do all we can for them, and teach them to read and write,\r\n    and endeavor to place them in a condition to take care of\r\n    themselves. Loguen had a fine meeting in my Tabernacle last\r\n    night, and made a good collection for the cause of the\r\n    fugitives.\r\n\r\n    I should be happy to hear from you and your kind family, to whom\r\n    remember me very cordially. Believe me ever truly yours,\r\n\r\n    L.D. MANSFIELD.\r\n\r\n    Mr. and Mrs. Harris wish to be gratefully remembered to you and\r\n    yours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBenjamin Piney reported that he came from Baltimore county, Maryland,\r\nwhere he had been held in subjection to Mary Hawkins. He alleged that he\r\nhad very serious cause for grievance; that she had ill-treated him for a\r\nlong time, and had of late, threatened to sell him to Georgia. His\r\nbrothers and sisters had all been sold, but he meant not to be if he\r\ncould help himself. The sufferings that he had been called upon to\r\nendure had opened his eyes, and he stood still to wait for the\r\nUnderground Rail Road car, as he anxiously wished to travel north, with\r\nall possible speed. He waited but a little while, ere he was on the\r\nroad, under difficulties it is true, but he arrived safely and was\r\njoyfully received. He imagined his mistress in a fit of perplexity, such\r\nas he might enjoy, could he peep at her from Canada, or some safe place.\r\nHe however did not wish her any evil, but he was very decided that he\r\ndid not want any more to do with her. Benjamin was twenty years of age,\r\ndark complexion, size ordinary, mental capacity, good considering\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Smith was a yellow boy, nineteen years of age, stout build, with,\r\nmarked intelligence. He held Dr. Abraham Street responsible for treating\r\nhim as a slave. The doctor lived at Marshall District, Harford county,\r\nMaryland. John frankly confessed, to the credit of the doctor, that he\r\ngot \"a plenty to eat, drink and wear,\" yet he declared that he was not\r\nwilling to remain a slave, he had higher aims; he wanted to be above\r\nthat condition. \"I left,\" said he, \"because I wanted to see the country.\r\nIf he had kept me in a hogshead of sugar, I wouldn't stayed,\" said the\r\nbright-minded slave youth. \"They told me anything--told me to obey my\r\nmaster, but I didn't mind that. I am going off to see the Scriptures,\"\r\nsaid John.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew Jackson \"took out\" from near Cecil, Delaware, where he had been\r\nowned by a man calling himself Thomas Palmer, who owned seven or eight\r\nothers. His manners were by no means agreeable to Andrew; he was quite\r\ntoo \"blustery,\" and was dangerous when in one of his fits. Although\r\nAndrew was but twenty-three years of age, he thought that Palmer had\r\nalready had much more of his valuable services than he was entitled to,\r\nand he determined, that if he (the master), ever attempted to capture\r\nhim, he would make him remember him the longest day he lived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Hughes was an Eastern Shore \"piece of property\" belonging to\r\nDaniel Cox. William had seen much of the dark doings of Slavery, and his\r\nmind had been thoroughly set against the system. True, he had been but\r\ntwenty-two years under the heel of his master, but that was sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWesley Williams, on his arrival from Warrick, Maryland, testified that\r\nhe had been in the hands of a man known by the name of Jack Jones, from\r\nwhom he had received almost daily floggings and scanty food. Jones was\r\nhis so-called owner. These continual scourgings stirred the spirit of\r\nfreedom in Wesley to that degree, that he was compelled to escape for\r\nhis life. He left his mother (a free woman), and one sister in Slavery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRosanna Johnson, alias Catharine Beige. The spot that Rosanna looked\r\nupon with most dread and where she had suffered as a slave, under a man\r\ncalled Doctor Street, was near the Rock of Deer Creek, in Harford\r\ncounty, Maryland.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness in which Slavery ordinarily kept the fettered and \"free\r\nniggers,\" it was a considerable length of time ere Rosanna saw how\r\nbarbarously she and her race were being wronged and ground down--driven\r\nto do unrequited labor--deprived of an education, obliged to receive the\r\ncuffs, kicks, and curses of old or young, who might happen to claim a\r\ntitle to them. But when she did see her true condition, she was not\r\ncontent until she found herself on the Underground Rail Road.\r\n\r\nRosanna was about thirty years of age, of a dark color, medium stature,\r\nand intelligent. She left two brothers and her father behind. The\r\nCommittee forwarded her on North. From Albany Rose wrote back to inquire\r\nafter particular friends, and to thank those who had aided her--as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ALBANY, Jan. the 30, 1858.\r\n\r\n    Mrs. William Still:--i sit don to rite you a fue lines in saying\r\n    hav you herd of John Smith or Bengernin Pina i have cent letters\r\n    to them but i hav know word from them John Smith was oned by\r\n    Doker abe Street Bengermin oned by Mary hawkings i wish to kno\r\n    if you kno am if you will let me know as swon as you get this.\r\n    My lov to Mis Still i am much oblige for those articales.

He had, therefore, persuaded himself that Ellicott's Mills\r\nwas a poor neighborhood for a colored man who wanted his freedom, and\r\nthat all Maryland was no better. He had heard but little of Canada, but\r\nwhat he had heard pleased him. As to how he should get there, he knew\r\nnot; a whisper pointed him to the Underground Rail Road, and told him to\r\nbe fearless and take the first train. Sam considered the matter\r\ncarefully and concluded that that would be the only way to get off.\r\nUnfortunately his mother and two brothers were left behind in the hands\r\nof Simons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Townsend ran away from Caroline county, near Purnell P.O.,\r\nMaryland. The name of his reputed owner, according to his statement, was\r\nE. Townsend, a farmer. Against him Henry harbored a very heavy grudge,\r\nand will long hold said Townsend in remembrance for the injury he had\r\nreceived at his hands on his naked back. The back was shown, and a most\r\nfrightful picture was presented; it had been thoroughly cut in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nHenry was about twenty-one years of age, dark chesnut color, build\r\nsubstantial. He left behind two brothers and one sister in Slavery. The\r\nCommittee comforted him with the usual hospitality.\r\n\r\nThese passengers arrived the latter part of 1856 and the beginning of\r\n1857.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDRY ARRIVALS FROM MARYLAND, 1860.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM CHION AND HIS WIFE, EMMA, EVAN GRAFF, AND FOUR OTHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam and Emma came from Dorchester county, Maryland. The cords of\r\nSlavery had been tightly drawn around them. William was about\r\ntwenty-seven years of age, of a dark hue, and of a courageous bearing.\r\nOn the score of treatment he spake thus: \"I have been treated as bad as\r\na man could be.\" Emma, his wife, had seen about the same number of years\r\nthat he had, and her lot had been similar to his. Emma said, \"My master\r\nnever give me the second dress, never attempted such a thing.\" The\r\nmaster was called Bushong Blake. William was owned by a Mr. Tubman.\r\nAfter leaving Slavery, William changed his last name to Williams, and if\r\nhe and his wife are now living, they are known only by their adopted\r\nnames.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvan Graff was of square solid build, dark, and smart, age twenty-five.\r\nHe fled in company with four others (whose narratives were not written),\r\nfrom Frederick county, Maryland. Henry Heart, residing at Sam's Creek,\r\nexercised authority over Evan. With this master, said Evan, I have known\r\nhard times. I have been treated as bad as a man could be. I have been\r\nmarried three years and have not received five dollars in money since,\r\ntowards supporting my family. \"How have you lived then?\" inquired one\r\nwho sympathized. \"My wife has kept house for a colored gentleman, and\r\ngot her board for her services,\" said Evan. \"In what other particulars\r\nhave you been treated hard?\" was next asked. \"Sometimes I hadn't half\r\nclothes enough to keep me warm, through all weathers,\" answered Evan.\r\n\"What put it into your head to leave?\" was the third query. \"Well, sir,\"\r\nsaid Evan, \"I thought to try and do better.\" How did you make up your\r\nmind to leave your wife and child in Slavery? \"Well, sir, I was very\r\nloth to leave my wife and child, but I just thought in this way: I had a\r\nbrother who was entitled to his freedom, but he fell out with one of his\r\nyoung masters, and was just taken up and sold South, and I thought I\r\nmight be taken off too, so I thought I would stand as good a chance in\r\nleaving, as if I stayed.\" Had you a mother and father, brothers and\r\nsisters? inquired a member of the Committee. \"Yes, sir,\" was the prompt\r\nreply. Evan then gave their names thus: \"My father's name was Sam Graff,\r\nmy mother's name was Becky.\" Ruth Ann Dorsey, Isaac Hanson (and two\r\nbrothers of Evan), Grafton and Allen accompanied him in his flight.\r\nJames, Harriet, Charles Albert, Thomas Ephraim, Adeline Matilda, John\r\nIsrael and Daniel Buchanan (brothers and sisters of Evan), were all left\r\nin Slavery.\r\n\r\nPolly Pool was their mistress, rather had owned them up to within a\r\nshort time before the flight of Evan and his comrades, but she had\r\nlately been unfortunate in business, which resulted in a thorough\r\nscattering of the entire family. Some fell into the hands of the\r\nmistress' children, and some into the hands of the grandchildren. In\r\nEvan's opinion she was a tolerable good mistress; his opportunities of\r\njudging, however, had not been very favorable, as he had not been in her\r\nhands a great while.\r\n\r\nLuke Goines came from Harper's Ferry, where he was owned by Mrs.\r\nCarroll. Luke first made his way to Baltimore and afterwards to\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nHenson Kelly was owned by Reason Hastell, of Baltimore. Slavery did not\r\nagree with him, and he left to better his condition.\r\n\r\nStafford Smith fled from Westmoreland county, Virginia, where he was\r\nowned by Harriet Parker, a single woman, advanced in years, and the\r\nowner of many slaves \"As a mistress, she was very hard. I have been\r\nhired to first one and then another, bad man all along. My mistress was\r\na Methodist, but she seemed to know nothing about goodness. She was not\r\nin the habit of allowing the slaves any chance at all.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM VIRGINIA, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nJENNY BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nA KIND MASTER; JENNY CHASTISED ONE OF HIS SONS FOR AN INSULT, AND AS A\r\nPUNISHMENT SHE WAS SOLD--SEIZED FOR DEBT--SOLD A SECOND TIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nJenny was about forty-five years of age, a dark mulatto, stature medium,\r\nmanners modest and graceful; she had served only in high life; thus she\r\nhad acquired a great deal of information. She stated that she was born a\r\nslave, under John Bower, of Rockbridge, Virginia, and that he was the\r\nowner of a large plantation, with a great number of slaves. He was\r\nconsidered to be a good man to his servants, and was generally beloved\r\nby them. Suddenly, however, he was taken ill with paralysis, which\r\nconfined him to his bed. During this illness one of the sons, a young\r\ngentleman, offered an insult to Jenny, for which she felt justified in\r\nadministering to him, a severe chastisement. For this grave offence she\r\nwas condemned to be sold to a trader by the name of William Watts, who\r\nowned a place in Mississippi. The conditions of sale were that she was\r\nto be taken out of the state and never to be allowed to return. It so\r\nhappened, however, before she was removed that Watts, the trader, failed\r\nin order to cheat his creditors it was supposed. Governor McDowell, of\r\nVirginia, was one of those to whom he was largely indebted for a number\r\nof slaves which he, the Governor, had placed in his hands for disposal,\r\nsome time before the trader took the benefit. Therefore, as the Governor\r\nwas anxious to recover his loss as much as possible, he seized on Jenny.\r\nIt was through this interference that the condition relative to her\r\nbeing sent out of the state was broken.\r\n\r\n\"The Governor,\" said Jenny, \"was a very fine gentleman, as good as I\r\ncould expect of Virginia. He allowed his slaves to raise fowl and hogs,\r\nwith many privileges of one kind and another; besides he kept them all\r\ntogether; but he took sick and died. There was a great change shortly\r\nafter that. The slaves were soon scattered like the wind. The Governor\r\nhad nine sons and daughters.\r\n\r\nAfter his death Mrs. McDowell, alias Mrs. Sally Thomas, took possession,\r\nand employed an overseer, by the name of Henry Morgan. He was a very\r\ngood man in his looks, but a very rascally man; would get drunk, and\r\nsell her property to get whisky. Mrs. McDowell would let him do just as\r\nhe pleased. For the slightest complaint the overseer might see fit to\r\nmake against any of the slaves, she would tell him to sell them\"--\"Sell,\r\nMr. Morgan.\" \"He would treat them worse than he would any dog; would\r\nbeat them over the head with great hickory sticks, the same as he would\r\nbeat an ox. He would pasture cows and horses on the plantation, and keep\r\nthe money. We slaves all knew it, and we told her; but our words would\r\nnot go in court against a white man, and until she was told by Mr.\r\nWhite, and her cousin, Dr. Taylor, and Mr. Barclay, she would not\r\nbelieve how shamefully this overseer was cheating her. But at last she\r\nwas convinced, and discharged him, and hired another by the name of John\r\nMoore. The new one, if anything, was worse than the old one, for he\r\ncould do the most unblushing acts of cruelty with pleasure. He was a\r\ndemon.\"\r\n\r\nFinally the estate had to be settled, and the property divided. At this\r\ntime it was in the hands of the oldest daughter, Mistress Sally, who had\r\nbeen married to Frank Thomas, the Governor of Maryland. But the Governor\r\nhad discarded her for some reason or other, and according to his\r\npublished account of her it might seem that he had good reason for doing\r\nso. It was understood that he gave her a divorce, so she was considered\r\nsingle for life. It was also understood that she was to buy in the\r\nhomestead at a moderate price, with as many slaves as she might desire.\r\n\r\nSaid Jenny, \"I was sold at this settlement sale, and bought in by the\r\n'grass widow' for four hundred dollars.\" The place and a number of\r\nslaves were bought in on terms equally as low. After this the widow\r\nbecame smitten with a reverend gentleman, by the name of John Miller,\r\nwho had formerly lived North; he had been a popular preacher. After a\r\ncourtship, which did not last very long, they were married. This took\r\nplace three years ago, prior to the writing of this narrative. After the\r\nmarriage, Rev. Mr. Miller took up his abode on the old homestead, and\r\nentered upon his duties as a slave-holder in good earnest.\r\n\r\n\"How did you like him?\" inquired a member of the Committee.\r\n\r\n\"I despised him,\" was Jenny's prompt answer.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you despise him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he had such mean ways with him,\" said Jenny. She then went on\r\nto remark as follows:--\"Coming there, taking so much authority over\r\nother people's servants. He was so mean that he broke up all the\r\nprivileges the servants had before he came. He stopped all hands from\r\nraising chickens, pigs, etc. He don't like to see them hold up their\r\nheads above their shoulders.\" Didn't he preach? she was asked. \"Yes, but\r\nI never heard him preach; I have heard him pray though. On Thursday\r\nnights, when he would not want the servants to go into town to meeting,\r\nhe would keep up until it would be too late for them to go. He is now\r\ncarrying on the farm, and follows butchering. He has not yet sold any of\r\nthe slaves, but has threatened to sell all hands to the trader.\"\r\n\r\nJenny once had a husband, but he went to Canada, and that was all she\r\ncould tell about him, as she had never had a letter or any direct\r\ninformation from him since he left. That she was childless, she regarded\r\nas a matter of great satisfaction, considering all the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM BALTIMORE, 1860.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BROWN, AND JAMES HENSON\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering themselves trampled upon by their fellow-men, unitedly\r\nresolved to seek a better country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam was pained with the idea that so much of his time had already\r\nbeen used up, as he was then thirty-six years of age. Yet he thought\r\nthat it would do no good to mourn over the past, but do what he intended\r\nto do quickly. The master whom he had served, he called, \"Master\r\nLynchum.\" He was a farmer, and knew full well how to use severity with\r\nthe slaves; but had never practiced showing favors, or allowing\r\nprivileges of any kind. True he did not flog, but he resorted to other\r\nmeans of punishment when he desired to make the slaves feel that he was\r\nmaster. William left his mother, Harriet Brown, three sisters, and one\r\nbrother,--Francis, Mary, Eliza, and Robert. They were all free but\r\nEliza.\r\n\r\nSeven weeks William and James were under the painful anxiety of trying\r\nto escape, but conscious of the snares and dangers on the road, and\r\ndesirous of success, they did not feel at liberty to move, save as they\r\nsaw their way clear. This well-exercised sagacity was strongly marked in\r\nthe intellectual region of William's head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Henson was a man of rather slender build. From exposure in\r\ntraveling he took a severe cold and was suffering with sore throat. He\r\nand Mrs. Maria Thomas disagreed. She set herself up to be \"Jim's\"\r\nmistress and owner. For some cause or other Jim was unwilling to fill\r\nthis station longer. He had been hired out by his mistress, who received\r\none hundred dollars per annum; and, for aught Jim knew, she was pretty\r\nwell pleased with him and the money also. She coolly held eleven others\r\nin the same predicament. While Jim found no fault with the treatment\r\nreceived at the hands of his mistress, he went so far as to say that\r\n\"she was a right fine woman,\" yet, the longer he lived her slave, the\r\nmore unhappy he became. Therefore, he decided that he would try and do\r\nbetter, and accordingly, in company with William he started, success\r\nattending their efforts. James left three sisters and one brother,\r\nCharlotte, Susan, Ellen and Johnson, all slaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND.\r\n\r\nPHILIP STANTON, RANDOLPH NICHOLS, AND THOMAS DOUGLASS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip had a master by the name of John Smith, whom he was very anxious\r\nto get rid of, but hardly knew how. For a long time, Philip was annoyed\r\nin various ways. Being the only slave on the place, there was no rest\r\nfor him. Said Smith was a bachelor, and his mother, who kept house for\r\nhim, was quite aged; \"she was worse than the old boy wanted her to be, a\r\nmore contrary woman never was; she was bad in this way, she was\r\nquarrelsome, and then again she would not give you as much to eat as you\r\nought to have, and it was pretty rough; nothing but corn bread and the\r\nfattest pork, that was about all. She was a Catholic, and was known by\r\nthe name of Mary Eliza Smith.\" This was Philip's testimony against his\r\nmaster and mistress. Working on a farm, driving carriage, etc., had been\r\nPhilip's calling as a slave. His father and mother were free. His father\r\nhad been emancipated, and afterwards had purchased his wife. One sister,\r\nhowever, was still in Slavery. Philip had scarcely reached his\r\ntwenty-second year; he was nevertheless wide-awake and full of courage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRandolph was still younger; he had only just reached his twentieth year;\r\nwas nearly six feet high, athletic, and entertained quite favorable\r\nnotions of freedom. He was owned by Mrs. Caroline Brang, a widow; he had\r\nnever lived with her, however. Notwithstanding the fact that he had been\r\nheld in such unpleasant relations, Randolph held the opinion, that \"she\r\nwas a tolerable good woman.\" He had been hired out under Isaac Howard, a\r\nfarmer, who was described by Randolph as \"a rough man to everybody\r\naround him; he was the owner of slaves, and a member of the Methodist\r\nChurch, in the bargain.\" As if actuated by an evil spirit continually,\r\nhe seemed to take delight in \"knocking and beating the slaves,\" and\r\nwould compel them to \"be out in all weathers not fit to be out in.\"\r\nRandolph declared that \"he had never been allowed a day's schooling in\r\nhis life. On the contrary, he had often been threatened with sale, and\r\nhis mind had finally become so affected by this fearful looking-for of\r\nevil, that he thought he had better make tracks.\"\r\n\r\nHe left his mother, Louisa, three brothers and three sisters, namely:\r\nAndrew, Mary, Charity, Margaret, Lewis and Samuel, all slaves. His\r\ndesire to escape brought the thought home to his mind with great\r\nemphasis, that he was parting with his kinsfolk, to see them perhaps, no\r\nmore on earth; that however, happily he might be situated in freedom, he\r\nwould have the painful reflection ever present with him, that those he\r\nmost loved in this world, were slaves--\"knocked and beat about--and made\r\nto work out in all weathers.\" It was this that made many falter and give\r\nup their purpose to gain their freedom by flight, but Randolph was not\r\none of this class. His young heart loved freedom too well to waver. True\r\nto his love of liberty, he left all, followed the north star, and was\r\ndelivered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas, an older companion of Philip and Randolph, was twenty-five years\r\nof age, full black, and looked as if he could appreciate the schoolroom\r\nand books, and take care of himself in Canada or any other free country.\r\nMary Howard was the name of the individual that he was compelled to\r\naddress as \"mistress.\" He said, however, that \"she was a very good woman\r\nto her servants,\" and she had a great many. She had sons, but they\r\nturned out to be drunkards, and followed no business; at one time, each\r\nof them had been set up in business, but as they would not attend to it,\r\nof course they failed. Money was needed more than ever, through their\r\nintemperate course, consequently the mistress was induced to sell her\r\nlarge household, as well as her plantation slaves, to Georgia. Thomas\r\nhad seen the most of them take up their sorrowful march for said State,\r\nand the only reason that he was not among them, was attributable to the\r\nfact, that he had once been owned and thought pretty well of by the\r\nbrother of his mistress, who interceded in Thomas' behalf. This\r\ninterference had the desired effect, and Thomas was not sold. Still, his\r\neyes were fairly opened to see his danger and to learn a valuable lesson\r\nat the same time; he, therefore, profited by it in escaping the first\r\nchance. He left his mother Ann Williams, and one brother, James\r\nDouglass, both slaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM FREDERICKSBURG, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY TUDLE AND WIFE, MARY WILLIAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry affirmed, that for the last twenty years, his freedom had been\r\npromised him, and during all these long years, hardly a month had\r\npassed, that he had not fixed his hopes upon a definite time, when his\r\nbondage would end and his freedom commence. But he had been trusting the\r\nword of a slave-holder, who had probably adopted this plan simply with a\r\nview of drawing more willing toil out of him than he could have\r\naccomplished in any other way.\r\n\r\nMary complained that she had suffered severely for food, and likewise\r\nfor privileges. Ezra Houpt was the name of Henry's master, and the name\r\nof his mistress was Catharine, she was hasty and passionate; slaves were\r\nshown no quarter under her. Mary was owned by Christian Thomas. He was\r\nsaid to be not so hard, but his wife was very hard, so much so, that she\r\nwould rule both master and slaves. Her name was Mary Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDRY ARRIVALS FROM MARYLAND, 1860.\r\n\r\nSAM ARCHER, LEWIS PECK, DAVID EDWARDS, EDWARD CASTING, JOE HENRY, GEORGE\r\nAND ALBERT WHITE, JOSEPH C. JOHNSON, DAVID SNIVELY, AND HENRY DUNMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSam Archer was to \"become free at thirty-five years of age.\" He had\r\nalready served thirty years of this time; five years longer seemed an\r\nage to him. The dangers from other sources presented also a frightful\r\naspect. Sam had seen too many who had stood exactly in the same\r\nrelations to Slavery and freedom, and not a few were held over their\r\ntime, or cheated out of their freedom altogether. He stated that his own\r\nmother was \"kept over her time,\" simply \"that her master might get all\r\nher children.\" Two boys and two girls were thus gained, and were slaves\r\nfor life. These facts tended to increase Sam's desire to get away before\r\nhis time was out; he, therefore, decided to get off via the Underground\r\nRail Road. He grew very tired of Bell Air, Harford county, Maryland, and\r\nhis so-called owner, Thomas Hayes. He said that Hayes had used him\r\n\"rough,\" and he was \"tired of rough treatment.\" So when he got his plans\r\narranged, one morning when he was expected to go forth to an unrequited\r\nday's labor, he could not be found. Doubtless, his excited master\r\nthought Sam a great thief, to take himself away in the manner that he\r\ndid, but Sam was not concerned on this point; all that concerned him was\r\nas to how he could get to Canada the safest and the quickest. When he\r\nreached the Philadelphia station, he felt that the day dawned, his joy\r\nwas full, despite the Fugitive Slave Law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLewis Peck was a man six feet high, and of the darkest hue. He reported\r\nthat he fled from Joseph Bryant, a farmer, who lived near Patapsco\r\nRiver. Bryant was in the habit of riding around to look after the\r\nslaves. Lewis had become thoroughly disgusted with this manner of\r\nsuperintending. \"I got tired of having Bryant riding after me, working\r\nmy life out of me,\" said Lewis. He was also tired of Bryant's wife; he\r\nsaid \"she was always making mischief, and he didn't like a mischief\r\nmaker.\"\r\n\r\nThus he complained of both master and mistress, seeming not to\r\nunderstand that he \"had no rights which they were bound to respect.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Edwards broke away from the above named Bryant, at the age of\r\ntwenty-four. His testimony fully corroborated that of his comrade, Lewis\r\nPeck. He was also a man of the darkest shade, tall, intellect good, and\r\nwore a pleasant countenance. The ordinary difficulties were experienced,\r\nbut all were surmounted without serious harm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward Casting and Joseph Henry were each about seventeen years of age.\r\nBoys, as they were, with no knowledge of the world, they had wisely\r\nresolved not to remain in that condition. Edward fled from Robert Moore,\r\nwho lived at Duck Creek. He gave his master the name of being a \"bad\r\nman,\" and refused to recommend him for anything. Being a likely-looking\r\nchattel, he would have doubtless brought seven hundred dollars in the\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph Henry came from Queen Ann county, Maryland. He was a well-grown\r\nlad, and showed traces of having been raised without proper care, or\r\ntraining. For deficiencies in this direction, he charged Greenberry\r\nParker, his claimant, who he said had treated him \"bad.\" Friends had\r\nhelped these boys along.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge and Albert White were brothers. They fled from Cecil county,\r\nMaryland. They escaped from William Parker. \"What kind of a man was\r\nWilliam Parker?\" they were asked. \"He was a big, bad man, no goodness in\r\nhim,\" quickly replied one of the brothers. Their lot in Slavery had not\r\nbeen different from that of numbers coming from that section of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph G. Johnson fled from William Jones of Baltimore. He said that his\r\nmaster kept a grocery store in Pratt street, and owned six head of\r\nslaves; that he was a \"good man, and always treated his servants very\r\nwell,\" until about three weeks before he escaped. For some reason\r\nunknown to Joseph, within the time just alluded to, he had sold all his\r\nslaves, with the exception of himself. Joseph was far from being at\r\nease, as he hourly felt oppressed with the fear that he was to be sold\r\nat an early day.\r\n\r\nSummoning courage he started by the Baltimore and Wilmington Rail Road.\r\nIn this way he reached Wilmington where he unfortunately fell into the\r\nhands of his master's son, who resided in Wilmington, and happened to\r\ndiscover Joseph in the cars, (most likely he had been telegraphed to)\r\nand had him arrested and returned. But Joseph did not allow a week to\r\npass over him before he was ready to make even a still more daring\r\nadventure for his liberty. This time he concluded to try the water; by\r\ngreat economy he had saved up twenty-five dollars. This was a great deal\r\nto him, but he resolved to give it all willingly to any man who would\r\nsecrete him, or procure him a passage to Philadelphia. The right man was\r\nsoon found, and Joseph was off again. Good luck attended him, and he\r\nreached the Committee safely. He was in his twenty-third year, a man of\r\nmedium size, copper-colored, and of a prepossessing countenance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Snively ran away from Frederick, Maryland. He was moved to escape\r\nsolely by the love of freedom. His services had been required in the\r\nblacksmith shop, and on the farm under Charles Preston, who claimed to\r\nown him. He had been sold once and brought nine hundred dollars; he\r\nresolved that a similar fate should never overtake him, unless his owner\r\nmoved very suddenly in that direction. While Joseph was working daily in\r\nthe blacksmith shop, he was planning how to make good his escape. No way\r\nwas open but the old route, which led \"hard by\" many dangers, and was\r\nonly accessible now and then through regions where friends were few and\r\nfar between. Howbeit he possessed the faith requisite, and was\r\nvictorious.\r\n\r\nJoseph was twenty-six years of age, of unmixed blood, ordinary size, and\r\nhad a commendable share of courage and intellect. He could recommend no\r\ngood traits as his master's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Dunmore had served as a slave up to the age of thirty-five, and\r\nwas then on the eve of being sold. As he had endured severe hardship\r\nunder his old master John Maldon he was unwilling to try another. While\r\nhe gave Maldon credit for being a member of the Methodist Church, he\r\ncharged him with treating himself in a most unchristian-like manner. He\r\ntestified that Maldon did not allow him half enough to eat; and once he\r\nkept him out in the cold until his toes were frozen off. Consequently it\r\nwas not in the heart of Henry to give his master any other than a bad\r\nname. He lived about sixteen miles from Elkton, near Charleston,\r\nMaryland. He was of a dark chestnut color, well-made, and active.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCROSSING THE BAY IN A BATTEAU.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHARP CONTEST WITH PURSUERS ON WATER. FUGITIVES VICTORIOUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS SIPPLE, and his wife, MARY ANN, HENRY BURKETT, and ELIZABETH, his\r\nwife, JOHN PURNELL, and HALE BURTON. This party were slaves, living near\r\nKunkletown, in Worcester county, Maryland, and had become restive in\r\ntheir fetters. Although they did not know a letter of the alphabet, they\r\nwere fully persuaded that they were entitled to their freedom. In\r\nconsidering what way would be safest for them to adopt, they concluded\r\nthat the water would be less dangerous than any other route. As the\r\nmatter of freedom had been in their minds for a long time, they had\r\nfrequently counted the cost, and had been laying by trifling sums of\r\nmoney which had fallen perchance into their hands. Among them all they\r\nhad about thirty dollars. As they could not go by water without a boat,\r\none of their number purchased an old batteau for the small sum of six\r\ndollars. The Delaware Bay lay between them and the Jersey shore, which\r\nthey desired to reach. They did not calculate, however, that before\r\nleaving the Delaware shore they would have to contend with the enemy.\r\nThat in crossing, they would lose sight of the land they well\r\nunderstood. They managed to find out the direction of the shore, and\r\nabout the length of time that it might take them to reach it. Undaunted\r\nby the perils before them the party repaired to the bay, and at ten\r\no'clock, P.M. embarked direct for the other shore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nNear Kate's Hammock, on the Delaware shore, they were attacked by five\r\nwhite men in a small boat. One of them seized the chain of the\r\nfugitives' boat, and peremptorily claimed it. \"This is not your boat, we\r\nbought this boat and paid for it,\" spake one of the brave fugitives. \"I\r\nam an officer, and must have it,\" said the white man, holding on to the\r\nchain. Being armed, the white men threatened to shoot. Manfully did the\r\nblack men stand up for their rights, and declare that they did not mean\r\nto give up their boat alive. The parties speedily came to blows. One of\r\nthe white men dealt a heavy blow with his oar upon the head of one of\r\nthe black men, which knocked him down, and broke the oar at the same\r\ntime. The blow was immediately returned by Thomas Sipple, and one of the\r\nwhite men was laid flat on the bottom of the boat. The white men were\r\ninstantly seized with a panic, and retreated; after getting some yards\r\noff they snapped their guns at the fugitives several times, and one load\r\nof small shot was fired into them. John received two shot in the\r\nforehead, but was not dangerously hurt. George received some in the\r\narms, Hale Burton got one about his temple, and Thomas got a few in one\r\nof his arms; but the shot being light, none of the fugitives were\r\nseriously damaged. Some of the shot will remain in them as long as life\r\nlasts. The conflict lasted for several minutes, but the victorious\r\nbondmen were only made all the more courageous by seeing the foe\r\nretreat. They rowed with a greater will than ever, and landed on a small\r\nisland. Where they were, or what to do they could not tell. One whole\r\nnight they passed in gloom on this sad spot. Their hearts were greatly\r\ncast down; the next morning they set out on foot to see what they could\r\nsee. The young women were very sick, and the men were tried to the last\r\nextremity; however, after walking about one mile, they came across the\r\ncaptain of an oyster boat. They perceived that he spoke in a friendly\r\nway, and they at once asked directions with regard to Philadelphia. He\r\ngave them the desired information, and even offered to bring them to the\r\ncity if they would pay him for his services. They had about twenty-five\r\ndollars in all. This they willingly gave him, and he brought them\r\naccording to agreement. When they found the captain they were not far\r\nfrom Cape May light-house.\r\n\r\nTaking into account the fact that it was night when they started, that\r\ntheir little boat was weak, combined with their lack of knowledge in\r\nrelation to the imminent danger surrounding them, any intelligent man\r\nwould have been justified in predicting for them a watery grave, long\r\nbefore the bay was half crossed. But they crossed safely. They greatly\r\nneeded food, clothing, rest, and money, which they freely received, and\r\nwere afterwards forwarded to John W. Jones, Underground Rail Road agent,\r\nat Elmira. The subjoined letter giving an account of their arrival was\r\nduly received:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ELMIRA, June 6th, 1860.\r\n\r\n    FRIEND WM. STILL:--All six came safe to this place. The two men\r\n    came last night, about twelve o'clock; the man and woman stopped\r\n    at the depot, and went east on the next train, about eighteen\r\n    miles, and did not get back till to-night, so that the two men\r\n    went this morning, and the four went this evening.\r\n\r\n      O, old master don't cry for me,\r\n      For I am going to Canada where colored men are free.\r\n\r\n\r\n    P.S. What is the news in the city? Will you tell me how many you\r\n    have sent over to Canada? I would like to know. They all send\r\n    their love to you. I have nothing new to tell you. We are all in\r\n    good health. I see there is a law passed in Maryland not to set\r\n    any slaves free. They had better get the consent of the\r\n    Underground Rail Road before they passed such a thing. Good\r\n    night from your friend,\r\n\r\n    JOHN W. JONES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM DORCHESTER CO., 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARRIET TUBMAN'S LAST \"TRIP\" TO MARYLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN ENNETS and wife, MARIA, with three children, whose names were as\r\nfollows: HARRIET, aged six years; AMANDA, four years, and a babe (in the\r\narms of its mother), three months old.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from Thomas Garrett throws light upon this arrival:\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILMINGTON, 12th mo., 1st, 1860.\r\n\r\n    RESPECTED FRIEND:--WILLIAM STILL:--I write to let thee know that\r\n    Harriet Tubman is again in these parts. She arrived last evening\r\n    from one of her trips of mercy to God's poor, bringing two men\r\n    with her as far as New Castle. I agreed to pay a man last\r\n    evening, to pilot them on their way to Chester county; the wife\r\n    of one of the men, with two or three children, was left some\r\n    thirty miles below, and I gave Harriet ten dollars, to hire a\r\n    man with carriage, to take them to Chester county. She said a\r\n    man had offered for that sum, to bring them on. I shall be very\r\n    uneasy about them, till I hear they are safe. There is now much\r\n    more risk on the road, till they arrive here, than there has\r\n    been for several months past, as we find that some poor,\r\n    worthless wretches are constantly on the look out on two roads,\r\n    that they cannot well avoid more especially with carriage, yet,\r\n    as it is Harriet who seems to have had a special angel to guard\r\n    her on her journey of mercy, I have hope.\r\n\r\n    Thy Friend,\r\n\r\n    THOMAS GARRETT.\r\n\r\n    N.B. We hope all will be in Chester county to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese slaves from Maryland, were the last that Harriet Tubman piloted\r\nout of the prison-house of bondage, and these \"came through great\r\ntribulation.\"\r\n\r\nStephen, the husband, had been a slave of John Kaiger, who would not\r\nallow him to live with his wife (if there was such a thing as a slave's\r\nowning a wife.) She lived eight miles distant, hired her time,\r\nmaintained herself, and took care of her children (until they became of\r\nservice to their owner), and paid ten dollars a year for her hire. She\r\nwas owned by Algier Pearcy. Both mother and father desired to deliver\r\ntheir children from his grasp. They had too much intelligence to bear\r\nthe heavy burdens thus imposed without feeling the pressure a grievous\r\none.\r\n\r\nHarriet Tubman being well acquainted in their neighborhood, and knowing\r\nof their situation, and having confidence that they would prove true, as\r\npassengers on the Underground Rail Road, engaged to pilot them within\r\nreach of Wilmington, at least to Thomas Garrett's. Thus the father and\r\nmother, with their children and a young man named John, found aid and\r\ncomfort on their way, with Harriet for their \"Moses.\" A poor woman\r\nescaping from Baltimore in a delicate state, happened to meet Harriet's\r\nparty at the station, and was forwarded on with them. They were cheered\r\nwith clothing, food, and material aid, and sped on to Canada. Notes\r\ntaken at that time were very brief; it was evidently deemed prudent in\r\nthose days, not to keep as full reports as had been the wont of the\r\nsecretary, prior to 1859. The capture of John Brown's papers and\r\nletters, with names and plans in full, admonished us that such papers\r\nand correspondence as had been preserved concerning the Underground Rail\r\nRoad, might perchance be captured by a pro-slavery mob. For a year or\r\nmore after the Harper's Ferry battle, as many will remember, the mob\r\nspirit of the times was very violent in all the principal northern\r\ncities, as well as southern (\"to save the Union.\") Even in Boston,\r\nAbolition meetings were fiercely assailed by the mob. During this\r\nperiod, the writer omitted some of the most important particulars in the\r\nescapes and narratives of fugitives. Books and papers were sent away for\r\na long time, and during this time the records were kept simply on loose\r\nslips of paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nJERRY MILLS, AND WIFE, DIANA, SON, CORNELIUS, AND TWO DAUGHTERS,\r\nMARGARET, AND SUSAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe father of this family was sixty-five years of age, and his working\r\ndays were apparently well nigh completed. The mother was fifty-seven\r\nyears of age; son twenty-seven; daughters seventeen and fifteen years of\r\nage.\r\n\r\nThe old man was smart for his years, but bore evidence that much hard\r\nlabor had been wrung out of him by Slavery. Diana said that she had been\r\nthe mother of twelve children; five had escaped to Canada, three were in\r\ntheir graves, and three accompanied her; one was left in Maryland. They\r\nhad seen hard times, according to the testimony of the old man and his\r\ncompanion, especially under David Snively, who, however, had been\r\n\"removed by the Lord\" a number of years prior to their escape; but the\r\nchange proved no advantage to them, as they found Slavery no better\r\nunder their mistress, the widow, than under their master. Mistress\r\nSnively was said to be close and stingy, and always unfriendly to the\r\nslave. \"She never thought you were doing enough.\" For her hardness of\r\nheart they were sure she would repent some time, but not while she could\r\nhold slaves. The belief was pretty generally entertained with the slaves\r\nthat the slaveholder would have to answer for his evil doings in another\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWELVE MONTHS IN THE WOODS, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY COTTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a slave, subjected to the whims and passions of his master, Henry\r\nmade up his mind that he could not stand it longer. The man who mastered\r\nit over him was called Nathaniel Dixon, and lived in Somerset Co., near\r\nNewtown. This Dixon was not content with his right to flog and abuse\r\nHenry as he saw fit, but he threatened to sell him, as he would sell a\r\nhog.\r\n\r\nAt this time Henry was about twenty-four years of age, but a man of more\r\nsubstantial parts physically was rarely to be seen. Courage was one of\r\nhis prominent traits. This threat only served to arouse him completely.\r\nHe had no friends save such as were in the same condition with himself,\r\nnevertheless he determined not to be sold. How he should escape this\r\nfate did not at first present itself. Every thing looked very gloomy;\r\nSlavery he considered as death to him; and since his master had\r\nthreatened him, he looked upon him as his greatest enemy, and rather\r\nthan continue a slave he preferred living in the swamps with wild\r\nanimals. Just one year prior to the time that he made his way North,\r\ndetermined not to be a slave any longer, he fled to a swamp and made his\r\nway to the most secluded spot that he could find,--to places that were\r\nalmost impenetrable so dense were the trees and undergrowth. This was\r\nall the better for Henry, he wanted to get safety; he did not wish\r\ncompany. He made known his plans to a dear brother, who engaged to\r\nfurnish him occasionally with food. Henry passed twelve months in this\r\nway, beholding no human soul save his brother. His brother faithfully\r\ntook him food from time to time. The winter weather of 1859 was very\r\nhard, but it was not so hard to bear as his master Nathaniel Dixon. The\r\nwill of Henry's old master entitled him to his freedom, but the heirs\r\nhad rendered said will null and void; this act in addition to the talk\r\nof selling had its effect in driving him to the woods. For a time he hid\r\nin the hollow of a tree, which went very hard with him, yet he was\r\nwilling to suffer anything rather than go back to his so-called master.\r\nHe managed finally to make good his escape and came to the Committee for\r\naid and sympathy, which he received.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut few passengers expressed themselves in stronger terms in regard to\r\ntheir so-called masters, than William Pierce, from Long Green. \"I fled,\"\r\nsaid he, \"from John Hickol, a farmer, about fifty years old, grey-headed\r\nand drinks whiskey very hard--was always a big devil--ill-grained. He\r\nowned fifteen head; he owns three of my brothers. He has a wife, a big\r\ndevil, red head; her servants, she wouldn't feed 'em none, except on\r\ncorn bread; she would fight and swear too, when she got ready. She and\r\nher husband would quarrel too. A slave man, a deceitful fellow, who had\r\nbeen put up to watch on one occasion, when the rest of the slaves had\r\nhelped themselves to a chicken, and cooked and ate it about midnight,\r\nthough he was allowed to share a portion of the feast, was ready enough\r\nto betray them by times next morning. This made master and mistress\r\n'cuss' all hands at a great rate, and master beat all hands except the\r\none that told. I was caned so badly that it laid me up for several\r\nweeks. I am a little lame yet from the beating.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was William's story. He was twenty-three years of age, of a light\r\nbrown color, well-made. Judging from his expressions and apparent\r\nfeelings against his master and mistress, he would be willing to endure\r\nmany years of suffering in Canada snows, before he would apply to them\r\nfor care and protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SLAVE CATCHER CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE F. ALBERTI PERSONATED BY A MEMBER OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE--A\r\nLADY FRIGHTENED BY A PLACARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, the quiet of the Anti-Slavery Office was suddenly\r\nagitated by the contents of a letter, privately placed in the hands of\r\nJ. Miller McKim by one of the clerks of the Philadelphia Ledger office.\r\nSaid letter it would seem, had been dropped into the box of the Ledger\r\noffice, instead of the U.S. box (one of which, was also in the Ledger\r\noffice), through a mistake, and seeing that it bore the name of a\r\nwell-known slave-catcher, Alberti, the clerk had a great desire to know\r\nits import. Whether it was or was not sealed, the writer cannot say, it\r\ncertainly was not sealed when it reached the Anti-Slavery office. It\r\nstated that a lady from Maryland was then in Philadelphia, stopping at a\r\nboarding-house on Arch Street, and that she was very desirous of seeing\r\nthe above-mentioned Alberti, with a view of obtaining his services to\r\nhelp catch an Underground Rail Road sojourner, whom she claimed as her\r\nproperty. That she wrote the letter could not be proved, but that it was\r\nsent by her consent, there was no doubt. In order to save the poor\r\nfellow from his impending doom, it seemed that nothing would avail but a\r\nbold strategical movement. Mr. McKim proposed to find some one who would\r\nbe willing to answer for Alberti. Cyrus Whitson, a member of the\r\nCommittee, in Mr. McKim's judgment, could manage the matter\r\nsuccessfully. At that time, C. Whitson was engaged in the Free Labor\r\nstore, at the corner of Fifth and Cherry streets, near the Anti-Slavery\r\noffice. On being sent for, he immediately answered the summons, and Mr.\r\nMcKim at once made known to him his plan, which was to save a fellow-man\r\nfrom being dragged back to bondage, by visiting the lady, and\r\nascertaining from her in conversation the whereabouts of the fugitives,\r\nthe names of the witnesses, and all the particulars. Nothing could have\r\ndelighted the shrewd Whitson better; he saw just how he could effect the\r\nmatter, without the slightest probable failure. So off he started for\r\nthe boarding-house.\r\n\r\nArriving, he rang the bell, and when the servant appeared, he asked if\r\nMiss Wilson, from Maryland, was stopping there. \"She is,\" was the\r\nanswer. \"I wish to see her.\" \"Walk in the parlor, sir.\" In went Mr. W.,\r\nwith his big whiskers. Soon Miss Wilson entered the parlor, a tall, and\r\nrather fine-looking well dressed lady. Mr. Whitson bowing, politely\r\naddressed her, substantially thus:\r\n\r\n\"I have come to see you instead of Mr. Geo. F. Alberti, to whom you\r\naddressed a note, this morning. Circumstances, over which Mr. A. had no\r\ncontrol, prevented his coming, so I have come, madam, to look after your\r\nbusiness in his place. Now, madam, I wish it to be distinctly understood\r\nin the outset, that whatever transpires between us, so far as this\r\nbusiness is concerned, must be kept strictly confidential, by no means,\r\nmust this matter be allowed to leak out; if it does, the darned\r\nabolitionists (excuse me), may ruin me; at any rate we should not be\r\nable to succeed in getting your slave. I am particular on this point,\r\nremember.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are perfectly right, Sir, indeed I am very glad that your plan is\r\nto conduct this matter in this manner, for I do not want my name mixed\r\nup with it in any way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, madam, I think we understand each other pretty well; now\r\nplease give me the name of the fugitive, his age, size, and color, and\r\nwhere he may be found, how long he has been away, and the witness who\r\ncan be relied on to identify him after he is arrested.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Wilson carefully communicated these important particulars, while\r\nMr. Whitson faithfully penciled down every word. At the close of the\r\ninterview he gave her to understand that the matter should be attended\r\nto immediately, and that he thought there would be no difficulty in\r\nsecuring the fugitive. \"You shall hear from me soon, madam, good\r\nafternoon.\"\r\n\r\nIn five minutes after this interview Whitson was back to the\r\nAnti-slavery Office with all Miss Wilson's secrets. The first thing to\r\nbe attended was to send a messenger to the place where the fugitive was\r\nat work, with a view of securing his safety; this was a success. The man\r\nwas found, and, frightened almost out of his wits, he dropped all and\r\nfollowed the messenger, who bore him the warning. In the meanwhile Mr.\r\nMcKim was preparing, with great dispatch, the subjoined document for the\r\nenlightenment and warning of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    TO WHOM IT MAY CONCEEN:\r\n\r\n    BEWARE OF SLAVE-CATCHERS.\r\n\r\n    Miss WILSON, of Georgetown Cross Roads, Kent county, Md., is now\r\n    in the city in pursuit of her alleged slave man, BUTLER. J.M.\r\n    Cummings and John Wilson, of the same place, are understood to\r\n    be here on a similar errand. This is to caution BUTLER and his\r\n    friends to be on their guard. Let them keep clear of the\r\n    above-named individuals. Also, let them have an eye on all\r\n    persons known to be friends of Dr. High, of Georgetown Cross\r\n    Roads, and Mr. D.B. Cummings, who is not of Georgetown Cross\r\n    Roads.\r\n\r\n    It is requested that all parties to whom a copy of this may be\r\n    sent will post it in a public place, and that the friends of\r\n    Freedom and Humanity will have the facts herein contained openly\r\n    read in their respective churches.\r\n\r\n    \"Hide the outcast; bewray not him that wandereth.\" Isaiah xvi.\r\n    3.\r\n\r\n    \"Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant that has\r\n    escaped from his master unto thee.\" Deut. xxiii. 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis document printed as a large poster, about three feet square, and\r\ndisplayed in large numbers over the city, attracted much attention and\r\ncomment, which facts were quickly conveyed to Miss Wilson, at her\r\nboarding-house. At first, as it was understood, she was greatly shocked\r\nto find herself in everybody's mouth. She unhesitatingly took her\r\nbaggage and started for \"My Maryland.\" Thus ended one of the most\r\npleasant interviews that ever took place between a slave-hunter and the\r\nVigilance Committee of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM RICHMOND, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY LANGHORN _alias_ WM. SCOTT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis \"chattel\" from Richmond, Virginia, was of a yellow complexion, with\r\nsome knowledge of the arts of reading and writing; he was about\r\ntwenty-three years of age and considered himself in great danger of\r\nbeing subjected to the auction-block by one Charles L. Hobson. Hobson\r\nand Henry had grown up from boyhood together; for years they had even\r\noccupied the same room,--Henry as a servant-boy and protector of his\r\nprospective young master. Under these relations quite strong affinities\r\nwere cemented between them, and Henry succeeded in gaining a knowledge\r\nof the alphabet with an occasional lesson in spelling. Both reached\r\ntheir majority. William was hired out at the American Hotel, and being a\r\n\"smart, likely-looking boy,\" commanded good wages for his young master's\r\nbenefit, who had commenced business as a tobacco merchant, with about\r\nseven head of slaves in his possession. A year or two's experiment\r\nproved that the young master was not succeeding as a merchant, and\r\nbefore the expiration of three years he had sold all his slaves except\r\nHenry. From such indications, Henry was fully persuaded that his time\r\nwas well nigh at hand, and great was his anxiety as he meditated over\r\nthe auction-block. \"In his heart\" he resolved time and again that he\r\nwould never be sold. It behooved him, therefore, to avert that ill fate.\r\nHe at first resolved to buy himself, but in counting the cost he found\r\nthat he would by no means be able to accumulate as much money as his\r\nmaster would be likely to demand for him; he, therefore, abandoned this\r\nidea and turned his attention straightway to the Underground Rail Road,\r\nby which route he had often heard of slaves escaping. He felt the need\r\nof money and that he must make and save an extra quarter whenever he\r\ncould; he soon learned to be a very rigid economist, and being\r\nexceedingly accommodating in waiting upon gentlemen at the hotel and at\r\nthe springs, he found his little \"pile\" increasing weekly. His object\r\nwas to have enough to pay for a private berth on one of the Richmond\r\nsteamers and also to have a little left to fall back on after landing in\r\na strange land and among strangers. He saved about two hundred dollars\r\nin cash; he was then ready to make a forward move, and he arranged all\r\nhis plans with an agent in Richmond to leave by one of the steamers\r\nduring the Christmas holidays. \"You must come down to the steamer about\r\ndark,\" said the agent \"and if all is right you will see the Underground\r\nRail Road agent come out with some ashes as a signal, and by this you\r\nmay know that all is ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will be there certain,\" said Henry. Christmas week he was confident\r\nwould be granted as usual as a holiday week; a few days before Christmas\r\nhe went to his master and asked permission to spend said holiday with\r\nhis mother, in Cumberland county, adding that he would need some\r\nspending money, enough at least to pay his fare, etc. Young master\r\nfreely granted his request, wrote him a pass, and doled him out enough\r\nmoney to pay his fare thence, but concluded that Henry could pay his way\r\nback out of his extra change. Henry expressed his obligations, etc., and\r\nreturned to the American Hotel. The evening before the time appointed\r\nfor starting on his Underground Rail Road voyage, he had occasion to go\r\nout to see the Underground Rail Road agent, and asked the clerk to give\r\nhim a pass. This favor was peremptorily refused. Henry, \"not willing to\r\ngive it up so,\" sat down to write a pass for himself; he found it all\r\nthat was necessary, and was thus enabled to accomplish his business\r\nsatisfactorily. Next day his Christmas holiday commenced, but instead of\r\nhis enjoying the sight of his mother, he felt that he had seen her for\r\nthe last time in the flesh. It was a sad reflection. That evening at\r\ndark, he was at the wharf, according to promise. The man with the ashes\r\nimmediately appeared and signalled him. In his three suits of clothing\r\n(all on his back), he walked on the boat, and was conducted to the coal\r\ncovering, where Egyptian darkness prevailed. The appointed hour for the\r\nstarting of the steamer, was ten o'clock the following morning. By the\r\naid of prayer, he endured the suffering that night. No sooner had the\r\nsteamer got under way, than a heavy gale was encountered; for between\r\nthree and four days the gale and fog combined, threatened the steamer\r\nwith a total loss. All the freight on deck, consisting of tobacco and\r\ncotton, had to be thrown overboard, to save the passengers.\r\n\r\nHenry, in his state of darkness, saw nothing, nor could he know the\r\nimminent peril that his life was in. Fortunately he was not sea-sick,\r\nbut slept well and long on the voyage. The steamer was five days coming.\r\nOn landing at Philadelphia, Henry could scarcely see or walk; the spirit\r\nof freedom, however, was burning brightly in the hidden man, and the\r\nfree gales of fresh air and a few hours on free soil soon enabled him to\r\novercome the difficulties which first presented themselves, and he was\r\nsoon one of the most joyful mortals living. He tarried two days with his\r\nfriends in Philadelphia, and then hastened on to Boston. After being in\r\nBoston two months, he was passing through the market one day, when, to\r\nhis surprise, he espied his young master, Charles L. Hobson. Henry was\r\nsure, however, that he was not recognized, but suspected that he was\r\nhunted. Instantly, Henry pulled up his coat collar, and drew his hat\r\nover his face to disguise himself as much as possible; but he could not\r\nwholly recover from the shock he had thus sustained. He turned aside\r\nfrom the market and soon met a friend formerly from Richmond, who had\r\nbeen in servitude in the tobacco factory owned by his master. Henry\r\ntried to prevail on him to spot out said Hobson, in the market, and see\r\nif there possibly could be any mistake. Not a step would his friend take\r\nin that direction. He had been away for several years, still he was a\r\nfugitive, and didn't like the idea of renewing his acquaintance with old\r\nor new friends with a white skin from Virginia. Henry, however, could\r\nnot content himself until he had taken another good look at Mr. Hobson.\r\nDisguising himself he again took a stroll through the market, looking on\r\nthe right and left as he passed along; presently he saw him seated at a\r\nbutcher's stall. He examined him to his satisfaction, and then went\r\nspeedily to headquarters (the Anti-Slavery Office), made known the fact\r\nof his discovery, and stated that he believed his master had no other\r\nerrand to Boston than to capture him. Measures were at once taken to\r\nascertain if such a man as Charles L. Hobson was booked at any of the\r\nhotels in Boston.\r\n\r\nOn finding that this was really a fact, Henry was offered and accepted\r\nprivate quarters with the well-known philanthropist and friend of the\r\nfugitive, Francis Jackson. His house as well as his purse was always\r\nopen to the slave. While under the roof of Mr. Jackson, as Hobson\r\nadvertised and described Henry so accurately, and offered a reward of\r\ntwo hundred and fifty dollars for him, Henry's friends thought that they\r\nwould return him the compliment by publishing him in the Boston papers\r\nquite as accurately if not with as high a reward for him; they\r\nadvertised him after this manner: \"Charles L. Hobson, twenty-two years\r\nof age, six feet high, with a slouched hat on, mixed coat, black pants,\r\nwith a goatee, is stopping at the Tremont Hotel,\" &c., &c. This was as a\r\nbomb-shell to Mr. Hobson, and he immediately took the hint, and with his\r\ntrunks steered for the sunny South. In a day or two afterwards Henry\r\ndeemed it advisable to visit Canada. After arriving there he wrote back\r\nto his young master, to let him know where he was, and why he left, and\r\nwhat he was doing. How his letter was received Henry was never informed.\r\nFor five years he lived in Boston and ran on a boat trading to Canada\r\nEast. He saved up his money and took care of himself creditably. He was\r\nsoon prepared to go into some business that would pay him better than\r\nrunning on the boat. Two of his young friends agreed with him that they\r\ncould do better in Philadelphia than in Boston, so they came to the City\r\nof Brotherly Love and opened a first-class dining-saloon near Third and\r\nChestnut streets. For a time they carried on the business with\r\nenterprise and commendable credit, but one of the partners, disgusted\r\nwith the prejudices of the city passenger railway cars, felt that he\r\ncould no longer live here. Henry, known after leaving Slavery only by\r\nthe name of Wm. Scott, quitted the restaurant business and found\r\nemployment as a messenger under Thomas A. Scott, Esq., Vice-President of\r\nthe Pennsylvania Central Rail Road, where he has faithfully served for\r\nthe last four years, and has the prospect of filling the office for many\r\nyears to come. He is an industrious, sober, steady, upright, and\r\nintelligent young man, and takes care of his wife and child in a\r\ncomfortable three story brick house of his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM RICHMOND, 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiles Robinson was the slave of Mrs. Roberts, a widow lady living in\r\nYork County, Virginia. He did not live with her, however, but was hired\r\nout in the city of Richmond. He had been fortunate in falling into hands\r\nthat had not treated him harshly. He was not contented, however. Much of\r\nthe leisure falling incidentally to his lot from hours of duty, he\r\ndevoted to the banjo. As a player on this instrument he had become quite\r\ngifted, but music in Richmond was not liberty. The latter he craved, and\r\nin thought was often far beyond Mason and Dixon's line, enjoying that\r\nwhich was denied him in Virginia. Although but twenty-two years of age,\r\nMiles was manly, and determination and intelligence were traits strongly\r\nmarked in his unusually well-shaped visage. Hearing that he was to be\r\nsold, he conferred not with his mother, brothers, or sisters, (for such\r\nhe had living as slaves in Richmond) but resolved to escape by the first\r\nconvenience. Turning his attention to the Underground Rail Road, he soon\r\nfound an agent who communicated his wishes to one of the colored women\r\nrunning as cook or chambermaid on one of the Philadelphia and Richmond\r\nsteamers, and she was bold enough to take charge of him, and found him a\r\nsafe berth in one of the closets where the pots and other cooking\r\nutensils belonged. It was rather rough and trying, but Miles felt that\r\nit was for liberty, and he must pass through the ordeal without\r\nmurmuring, which he did, until success was achieved and he found himself\r\nin Philadelphia. Boston being the haven on which his hopes were fixed,\r\nafter recruiting a short while in the city he steered for said place.\r\nFinding liberty there as sweet as he had fondly hoped to find it, he\r\napplied himself unceasingly to industrial pursuits, economy, the\r\nimprovement of his mind and the elevation of his race. Four years he\r\npassed thus, under the shadow of Bunker Hill, at the end of which time\r\nhe invested the earnings, which he had saved, in a business with two\r\nyoung friends in Philadelphia. All being first-class waiters and\r\nunderstanding catering, they decided to open a large dining-saloon.\r\nMiles was one of the two friends mentioned in Wm. Scott's narrative, and\r\nas his success and consequent fortunes have been already referred to, it\r\nwill suffice here to mention him simply in connection with two contests\r\nthat he sustained with the prejudice that sought to drive colored people\r\nfrom the passenger cars.\r\n\r\nAt the corner of Fourth and Walnut streets Miles, in company with two\r\nother young men, Wallace and Marshall, one evening in a most orderly\r\nmanner, entered the cars and took their seats. The conductor ordered\r\nthem on the front platform; they did not budge. He stopped the car and\r\nordered them out; this did no good. He read rules, and was not a little\r\nembarrassed by these polite and well-dressed young men. Finally he\r\ncalled for the police, who arrested all three. Miles did not yield his\r\nseat without a struggle. In being pulled out his resistance was such\r\nthat several window lights were broken in the car. The police being in\r\nstrong force, however, succeeded in marching their prisoners to the\r\nMayor's police station at the corner of Fifth and Chestnut streets where\r\nthey were locked up to await further investigation. The prisoners\r\nthought they were back in \"old Virginny\" again. Miles gritted his teeth\r\nand felt very indignant, but what could he do? The infamous prejudice\r\nagainst which they had borne testimony was controlling all the lines of\r\ncity passenger railways in Philadelphia. While Miles and his friends\r\nwere willing to suffer for a principle, the dirt, filth, cold, and\r\ndisagreeableness of the quarters that they most likely would be\r\ncompelled to occupy all night and the following day (Sunday) forbade\r\nsubmission. Added to this Miles felt that his young wife would hardly be\r\nable to contain herself while he was locked up. They sent for the writer\r\nto intercede for them.\r\n\r\nAt a late hour of the night, after going from the alderman's\r\nboardinghouse to a fire engine house and other places, where it was\r\nsupposed that he might probably be found, on going a third time to his\r\nhotel, a little before midnight, he was discovered to be in bed, and it\r\nwas then ascertained that he had not been out all the evening. The night\r\nwas very stormy. We could not tell whether or not the fruitless chase on\r\nwhich we had been sent in search of the alderman, was in keeping with\r\nthe spirit that had locked the men up, designed to mislead us; he\r\ncondescended at last to appear, and accepted our offer to go bail for\r\nall of them, and finally issued a discharge. This was hastily delivered\r\nat the station, and the prisoners were released.\r\n\r\nBut Miles was not satisfied; he had breathed free air in Massachusetts\r\nfor four years, and being a man of high spirit he felt that he must\r\nfurther test the prejudices of the cars. Consequently one very cold\r\nnight, when a deep snow covered the pavements, he was out with his wife,\r\nand thought that he would ride; his wife being fair, he put her on the\r\ncar at the corner of Third and Pine streets, and walked to the corner of\r\nFourth and Pine streets, where he stepped into the car and took his\r\nseat. The conductor straightway ordered him out, on the plea of color.\r\nGod had shaded him a little too much. \"How is this, my wife is in this\r\ncar,\" spake Miles. All eyes gazed around to see who his wife was. By\r\nthis time the car had been stopped, and the wrath of the conductor was\r\nkindled prodigiously. He did not, however, lay violent hands upon Miles.\r\nA late decision in court had taught the police that they had no right to\r\ninterfere, except in cases where the peace was actually being broken; so\r\nin order to get rid of this troublesome customer, the car was run off\r\nthe track, the shivering passengers all leaving it, as though flying\r\nfrom a plague, with the exception of Miles, his wife, and another\r\ncolored gentleman, who got on with Miles. The conductor then hoisted all\r\nthe windows, took out the cushions, and unhitched the horses. But Miles\r\nand his party stood it bravely; Miles burning all the time with\r\nindignation at this exhibition of prejudice in the city of Brotherly\r\nLove. The war was then raging fiercely, and as Miles then felt, he was\r\nalmost prepared to say, he didn't care which beat, as the woman said,\r\nwhen she saw her husband and the bear wrestling. He was compelled to\r\nadmit that this prejudice was akin to slavery, and gave to slavery its\r\nchief support.\r\n\r\nThe occupants of the horseless car, which was being aired so thoroughly,\r\nremained in it for a length of time, until they had sufficiently borne\r\ntheir testimony, and they too quietly forsook it.\r\n\r\nPrior to this event, by his industry and hard-earned savings, Miles had\r\nbecome the owner of a comfortable brick house, and had made up his mind\r\nto remain a citizen of Philadelphia, but the spirit which prompted the\r\naforesaid treatment called up within him reflections somewhat similar to\r\nthose aroused by Slavery, and it was not a great while before he offered\r\nhis property for sale, including his business stand, resolving to return\r\nto Boston. He received an offer for his property, accepted it, pulled up\r\nstakes, and again hopefully turned his face thitherward. The ambitious\r\nMiles commenced business in Chelsea, near Boston, where he purchased\r\nhimself a comfortable home; and he has ever since been successfully\r\nengaged in the sale of kerosene oil. Instead of seeking pleasure in the\r\nbanjo, as he was wont to do in Virginia, he now finds delight in the\r\nBaptist Church, Rev. Mr. Grimes', of which he is a prominent member, and\r\nin other fields of usefulness tending to elevate and better the\r\ncondition of society generally.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM RICHMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN WILLIAM DUNGY.--BROUGHT A PASS FROM EX. GOV. GREGORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He ought to be put in a cage and kept for a show,\" said Anna Brown,\r\ndaughter of the hero, John Brown, at the house of the writer, where she\r\nhappened to meet the above named Underground Rail Road passenger. He had\r\nthen just returned from Canada, after being a Refugee four years. In the\r\nmean time through the war and the Proclamation of Father Abraham the\r\nfetters had been torn from the limbs of the slave, and the way to\r\nRichmond was open to all. John William on this occasion was on his way\r\nthither to see how his brethren together with their old oppressors\r\nlooked facing each other as freemen. Miss Anna Brown was _en route_ to\r\nNorfolk, where she designed to teach a school of the unfettered bondmen.\r\nThe return of the Refugee was as unexpected as it was gratifying.\r\nScarcely had the cordial greetings of the writer and his family ended\r\nand the daughter of Brown been introduced before the writer was plying\r\nhis Refugee guest with a multiplicity of questions relative to his\r\nsojourn in Canada, etc. \"How have you been getting along in Canada? Do\r\nyou like the country?\" \"First-rate,\" said John William. \"You look as\r\nthough you had neither been starved, nor frozen. Have you had plenty of\r\nwork, made some money, and taken care of yourself?\" \"Yes.\" \"When you\r\nwere on the Underground Rail Road on your way to Canada you promised\r\nthat you were going to keep from all bad habits; how about the\r\n'crittur?' do you take a little sometimes?\" \"No, I have not drank a drop\r\nsince I left the South\" replied John William with emphasis. \"Good!\" \"I\r\nsuppose you smoke and chew at any rate?\" \"No, neither. I never think of\r\nsuch a thing.\" \"Now don't you keep late hours at night and swear\r\noccasionally?\" \"No, Sir. All the leisure that I have of evenings is\r\nspent over my books as a general thing; I have not fallen into the\r\nfashionable customs of young men.\" Miss Brown, who had been an attentive\r\nlistener, remarked: \"HE OUGHT TO BE PUT IN A CAGE, ETC.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nHe was twenty-seven years of age when he first landed in Philadelphia,\r\nin the month of February, 1860, per steamer Pennsylvania, in which he\r\nhad been stowed away in a store-room containing a lot of rubbish and\r\nfurniture; in this way he reached City Point; here a family of Irish\r\nemigrants, very dirty, were taken on board, and orders were given that\r\naccommodations should be made for them in the room occupied by J.W. Here\r\nwas trouble, but only for a moment. Those into whose charge he had been\r\nconsigned on the boat knew that the kettle and pot-closet had often been\r\nused for Underground Rail Road purposes, and he was safely conducted to\r\nquarters among the pots. The room was exceedingly limited, but he stood\r\nit bravely. On landing he was not able to stand. It required not only\r\nhis personal efforts but the help of friends to get him in a condition\r\nto walk. No sooner had he stepped on shore, however, than he began to\r\ncry aloud for joy. \"Thank God!\" rang out sonorously from his overflowing\r\nsoul. Alarmed at this indication of gratitude his friends immediately\r\ntold him that that would never do; that all hands would be betrayed;\r\nthat he was far from being safe in Philadelphia. He suppressed his\r\nemotion. After being delivered into the hands of the Acting Committee,\r\nwhere he was in more private quarters, he gave full vent to the joy he\r\nexperienced on reaching this city. He said that he had been trying\r\nearnestly for five years to obtain his freedom. For this special object\r\nhe had saved up sixty-eight dollars and fifteen cents, all of which but\r\nthe fifteen cents he willingly paid for his passage on the boat. Fifteen\r\ncents, the balance of his entire capital, was all that he had when he\r\nlanded in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the South he was hired in the family of Ex-Governor\r\nGregory. Of the Governor and his wife he spoke very highly,--said that\r\nthey were kind to him and would readily favor him whenever he solicited\r\nthem to do so. He stated that after making his arrangements to start, in\r\norder that he might be away several days before being missed, he told\r\nMrs. Gregory that he would be glad to spend a week with his mother, (she\r\nlived some distance in the country). As he was not feeling very well she\r\nkindly acceded to his request, and told him to ask the Governor for a\r\npass and some money. The Governor was busy writing, but he at once\r\ngranted the prayer, wrote him a pass, gave John five dollars, adding\r\nthat he was sorry that he had no more in his pocket, &c. John bowed and\r\nthanked the Governor, and soon got ready for his visit; but his route\r\nlay in a far different direction than that contemplated by the Governor\r\nand his lady. He was aiming for the Underground Rail Road. As has\r\nalready been intimated, he was not owned by the Governor, but by the\r\nFerrell heirs--five children who had moved from Virginia to Alabama\r\nyears back. \"Every Ferrell that lives is down on slaves; they are very\r\nsevere,\" said John. Yet he had not suffered as many others had who\r\nbelonged to them, as he had been a dining-room servant. At one time they\r\nhad owned large numbers of slaves, but latterly they had been selling\r\nthem off. Contrary to John's wishes his Alabama owners had notified him\r\nas well as the Governor, that in a short while he was to be taken to\r\nAlabama. This induced John to act with great promptness in leaving at\r\nthe time that he did.\r\n\r\nAfter passing several years in Canada as has been already noticed, he\r\nreturned to Richmond and paid a visit to his old home.\r\n\r\nHe found that the governor and his wife had both departed, but two of\r\nthe daughters (young ladies), still lived. They were both glad to see\r\nhim; the younger especially; she told him that she was glad that he\r\nescaped, and that she \"prayed for him.\" The elder remarked that she had\r\nalways thought that he was too \"good a Christian to run away.\" Another\r\nthing which she referred to, apparently with much feeling, was this: On\r\nhis way to Canada, he wrote to the governor, from Rochester, \"that he\r\nneed put himself to no trouble in hunting him up, as he had made up his\r\nmind to visit Canada.\" She thought that John was rather \"naughty,\" to\r\nwrite thus to her \"papa,\" nevertheless, she was disposed to forgive him,\r\nafter she had frankly spoken her mind.\r\n\r\nJohn found Richmond, which so long had held him in chains, fully\r\nhumbled, and her slave power utterly cast down. His wondering eyes gazed\r\nuntil he was perfectly satisfied that it was the Lord's doings, and it\r\nwas marvellous in his eyes. He was more than ever resolved to get an\r\neducation, and go back to Virginia, to help teach his brethren who had\r\nbeen so long denied the privilege. It was not long before he was at\r\nOberlin College, a faithful student, commanding the highest respect from\r\nall the faculty for his good deportment and studious habits.\r\n\r\nAfter advancing rapidly there, the way opened more fully to pursue his\r\nstudies with greater facilities and less expense at a college in one of\r\nthe Eastern States. He accepted the favors of friends who offered him\r\nassistance, with a view of preparing him for a mission among the\r\nfreedmen, believing that he possessed in a high degree, the elements for\r\na useful worker, preacher, organizer and teacher. As the friends alluded\r\nto, were about taking measures to start a college at Harper's Ferry,\r\nespecially for the benefit of the Freedmen, they anticipated making this\r\nlatitude the field of his future endeavors, at least for a time. Ere he\r\ngraduated in view of the fact that the harvest in the South so urgently\r\ncalled for laborers, he was solicited to be an agent for the Storer\r\nCollege,[A] and subsequently to enter upon a mission under the auspices\r\nof the Free-Will Baptists, in Martinsburg, Virginia. For three or four\r\nyears he labored in this field with commendable zeal and acceptably,\r\ngathering young and old in day and Sunday-schools, and also organizing\r\nchurches. By his constant labors his health became impaired; receiving a\r\ncall from a church in Providence, he accepted, not without knowing,\r\nhowever, that his mission was to be left in faithful hands, to carry on\r\nthe good work.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The appended extract from an official circular, issued by\r\nthe Board of Instruction of Storer College, will throw light upon this\r\nInstitution: STORER COLLEGE, HARPER'S FERRY, WEST VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\nThis Institution, deriving its name from John Storer, Esq., late of\r\nSanford, Me., who gave ten thousand dollars to aid in its establishment,\r\nis located at Harper's Ferry, West Va., and has been chartered with full\r\npowers by a special act of the Legislature.

Indeed, the churches are closed against\r\nthem. At different times, Mr. Dungy has eloquently represented the\r\ncondition of the colored churches of the South, in the city of\r\nPhiladelphia. As a speaker, Mr. Dungy is able and interesting, of good\r\naddress, remarkably graceful in his manners, and possessing much general\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nThe subjoined letters received from him, while a fugitive in Canada, are\r\ncharacteristic of the man, and will repay a perusal.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BRANTFORD, March 3d, 1860.\r\n\r\n    MR. WM. STILL, DEAR SIR:--I have seated myself this evening to\r\n    write you a few lines to inform you that I have got through my\r\n    journey, and landed safely in Brantford, where I found my\r\n    friend, Stepney Brown, and we expressed great joy at meeting\r\n    each other, and had a great shaking of hands, and have not got\r\n    done talking yet of the old times we had in Virginia.\r\n\r\n    I thank God I am enjoying vigorous health, and hope you all are\r\n    well, as it is written in the first Psalm, \"Blessed is the man\r\n    that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in\r\n    the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.\"\r\n\r\n    I wish you may think of me often and pray for me that I may grow\r\n    a man, one of the followers of our meek and lowly Saviour. Give\r\n    my love to Mrs. Still, and family, and the Rev. Mr. Gibbs, that\r\n    was residing with you when I was there.\r\n\r\n    I must now inform you a little about Canada, at least as much of\r\n    it as I have seen and heard. I arrived in the city of Hamilton,\r\n    on the 15th February, 1860, at nine o'clock in the evening, and\r\n    the weather was dreary and cold, and the cars laid over there\r\n    until ten o'clock next day, and I went up into the city and saw\r\n    a portion of it. I then started for Toronto, arrived there same\r\n    day at 12 o'clock. There I met friends from Richmond, remained\r\n    there several days; during the time we had a very extensive snow\r\n    storm, and I took the opportunity of walking around the city\r\n    looking at the elephants, and other great sights. I liked it\r\n    very much; but upon hearing that my friend and brother Stepney\r\n    Brown was in Brantford, I became disatisfied and left for\r\n    Brantford on the 21st February, 1860. I have found it a very\r\n    pleasant, and have been told it is the prettiest place in\r\n    Canada.\r\n\r\n    It is built upon the Grand River, which is two hundred miles\r\n    long, and empties into Lake Erie. It rises to a great height\r\n    every spring, and great masses of ice come down, bringing\r\n    bridges, saw-logs, trees, and fairly sweeps everything before\r\n    it. The people who live upon the flats are in great danger of\r\n    being drowned in their houses.\r\n\r\n    I got a situation immediately at the Kerby House, by the\r\n    influence of my friend and brother, Stepney Brown, who I must\r\n    say has been very kind to me, as also have the people of\r\n    Brantford. The Kerbey House is the largest hotel in the town\r\n    about 250 rooms, and a stable at the back, with a gas-house of\r\n    its own. No more at present, but remain,\r\n\r\n    Yours very respectfully,\r\n\r\n    JOHN WILLIAM DUNGY.\r\n\r\n    P.S. Write at your earliest convenience, and oblige your friend,\r\n    J.W.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    BRANTFORD, April 20th.\r\n\r\n    MR. STILL, DEAR SIR:--I feel myself quite lonesome this evening,\r\n    and not hearing from you lately I take this opportunity to drop\r\n    you a few lines. I have not much to say, brother Brown has left\r\n    for the falls, and expects to return next winter. The weather is\r\n    mild and warm at this time; the grass is putting up and begins\r\n    to look like spring. I thank the Lord I am enjoying good health\r\n    at this time. I hope this letter will find you and your family\r\n    well, give my compliments to them all and Mr. Gibbs and the\r\n    young lady that was at your house when I was there. Times has\r\n    been hard this winter, but they are increasing for the better. I\r\n    wrote to you a few days ago, I don't know whether you got my\r\n    letter. I asked in my letter if Mr. Williams was on the\r\n    pennsylvania, that runs from their to Richmond, Va. I should\r\n    have written to him, but I did not know his number, I also named\r\n    a friend of mine, Mr Plumer if he arrives their pleas to tell\r\n    him to come to Brantford, where I am for there are good chances\r\n    for business I think a great deal about my colored brethren in\r\n    the South but I hope to be a benefit to them one of these days.\r\n    We have quite a melancholy affair about one of our colored\r\n    brothers who made his escape from the South those who took him\r\n    up have gone back to obtain witness to convict him for murder.\r\n    These witness is to be here on Monday 23 inst but the defendence\r\n    of the law says they shant take him back unless they bring good\r\n    witness and men of truth I will write you more about it after\r\n    the trial comes of. I must say a little about myself. I want to\r\n    devote myself to study if I can for the next twelve months. I\r\n    expect to leave the Kirby House on the 5th of may. I have taken\r\n    a barber shop which is a very good situation and one hand\r\n    employed with me. I would be much oblige to you if you would\r\n    give me some advice what to do. I sent you the morning herald\r\n    yesterday which contained a accident which occurd on the G.\r\n    trunk R.W. you will see in it that we don't have much politics\r\n    here. The late destructive fire we had I thought it would have\r\n    kept brantford back this summer but it is increasing slowly I\r\n    have nothing more to say at this time. I hope the Lord may bless\r\n    you all and take care of you in this world, and after time\r\n    receive you in his everlasting kingdom through Jesus Christ our\r\n    Lord. Answer this as soon as convenient. Good bye.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully\r\n\r\n    J.W. DUNGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        BRANTFORD, C.W., JANUARY 11th, 61.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MR. WM. STILL, DEAR SIR:--I take this opportunity to drop you a\r\n    few lines to let you hear from me. I am well at this time,\r\n    hoping this will find you the same.\r\n\r\n    I acknowledge my great neglectness of you with great regret that\r\n    I have not answered your letter before this, I hope you will\r\n    excuse me as I have succeeded in getting me a wife since I wrote\r\n    to you last.\r\n\r\n    My mind has been much taken up in so doing for several months\r\n    past. Give my compliments to your wife and your family, and Mr.\r\n    Gibbs, also hoping they are all well. Tell Mrs. Still to pray\r\n    for me that I may grow in grace and the knowledge of the truth\r\n    as it is in Jesus.\r\n\r\n    I often think of you all. I pray that the time may come when we\r\n    will all be men in the United States. We have read here of the\r\n    great disturbance in the South. My prayer is that this may be a\r\n    deathblow to Slavery. Do you ever have any Underground Rail Road\r\n    passengers now? Times have been very prosperous in Canada this\r\n    year.\r\n\r\n    The commercial trade and traffic on the railways has been very\r\n    dull for these few months back. Business on the Buffalo and Lake\r\n    Huron railway has been so dull that a great number of the hands\r\n    have been discharged on account of the panic in the South.\r\n\r\n    Canada yet cries, Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!\r\n\r\n    I must now say a little about my friend and brother Stepney\r\n    Brown, he lived about six months at the Niagara Falls and is now\r\n    going to school here in Brantford, he sends his best respects to\r\n    you all. He and I often sit together at night after the labor of\r\n    the day is over talking about our absent friends wishing we\r\n    could see them once more.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Brown and myself have been wishing for one or two of your\r\n    slavery standards and would be much obliged to you if you would\r\n    send some of the latest.\r\n\r\n    Please let me hear from you as soon as possible. I must now\r\n    bring my letter to a close and remain your affectionate friend,\r\n\r\n    J.W. DUNGY.\r\n\r\n    P.S. May the Lord be with you. J.W. DUNGY.\r\n\r\n    Address your letter to John W. Dungy, Brantford, C.W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"AUNT HANNAH MOORE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1854 in company with her so-called Mistress (Mary Moore) Aunt Hannah\r\narrived in Philadelphia, from Missouri, being _en route_ to California,\r\nwhere she with her mistress was to join her master, who had gone there\r\nyears before to seek his fortune. The mistress having relatives in this\r\ncity tarried here a short time, not doubting that she had sufficient\r\ncontrol over Aunt Hannah to keep her from contact with either\r\nabolitionists or those of her own color, and that she would have no\r\ndifficulty in taking her with her to her journey's end. If such were her\r\ncalculations she was greatly mistaken. For although Aunt Hannah was\r\ndestitute of book-learning she was nevertheless a woman of thought and\r\nnatural ability, and while she wisely kept her counsel from her mistress\r\nshe took care to make her wants known to an abolitionist. She had passed\r\nmany years under the yoke, under different owners, and now seeing a ray\r\nof hope she availed herself of the opportunity to secure her freedom.\r\nShe had occasion to go to a store in the neighborhood where she was\r\nstopping, and to her unspeakable joy she found the proprietor an\r\nabolitionist and a friend who inquired into her condition and proffered\r\nher assistance. The store-keeper quickly made known her condition at the\r\nAnti-slavery Office, and in double-quick time J.M. McKim and Charles\r\nWise as abolitionists and members of the Vigilance Committee repaired to\r\nthe stopping-place of the mistress and her slave to demand in the name\r\nof humanity and the laws of Pennsylvania that Aunt Hannah should be no\r\nlonger held in fetters but that she should be immediately proclaimed\r\nfree. In the eyes of the mistress this procedure was so extraordinary\r\nthat she became very much excited and for a moment threatened them with\r\nthe \"broomstick,\" but her raving had no effect on Messrs. McKim and\r\nWise, who did not rest contented until Aunt Hannah was safely in their\r\nhands. She had lived a slave in Moore's family in the State of Missouri\r\nabout ten years and said she was treated very well, had plenty to eat,\r\nplenty to wear, and a plenty of work. It was prior to her coming into\r\nthe possession of Moore that Aunt Hannah had been made to drink the\r\nbitter waters of oppression. From this point, therefore, we shall\r\npresent some of the incidents of her life, from infancy, and very nearly\r\nword for word as she related them:\r\n\r\n\"Moore bought me from a man named McCaully, who owned me about a year. I\r\nfared dreadful bad under McCaully. One day in a rage he undertook to\r\nbeat me with the limb of a cherry-tree; he began at me and tried in the\r\nfirst place to snatch my clothes off, but he did not succeed. After that\r\nhe beat the cherry-tree limb all to pieces over me. The first blow\r\nstruck me on the back of my neck and knocked me down; his wife was\r\nlooking on, sitting on the side of the bed crying to him to lay on.\r\nAfter the limb was worn out he then went out to the yard and got a lath,\r\nand he come at me again and beat me with that until he broke it all to\r\npieces. He was not satisfied then; he next went to the fence and tore\r\noff a paling, and with that he took both hands, 'cursing' me all the\r\ntime as hard as he could. With an oath he would say, 'now don't you love\r\nme?' 'Oh master, I will pray for you, I would cry, then he would 'cuss'\r\nharder than ever.' He beat me until he was tired and quit. I crept out\r\nof doors and throwed up blood; some days I was hardly able to creep.\r\nWith this beating I was laid up several weeks. Another time Mistress\r\nMcCaully got very angry. One day she beat me as bad as he did. She was a\r\nwoman who would get very mad in a minute. One day she began scolding and\r\nsaid the kitchen wasn't kept clean. I told her the kitchen was kept as\r\nclean as any kitchen in the place; she spoke very angry, and said she\r\ndidn't go by other folks but she had rules of her own. She soon ordered\r\nme to come in to her. I went in as she ordered me; she met me with a\r\nmule-rope, and ordered me to cross my hands. I crossed my hands and she\r\ntied me to the bedstead. Here her husband said, 'my dear, now let me do\r\nthe fighting.' In her mad fit she said he shouldn't do it, and told him\r\nto stand back and keep out of the way or I will give you the cowhide she\r\nsaid to him. He then 'sot' down in a 'cheer' and looked like a man\r\ncondemned to be hung; then she whipped me with the cowhide until I sunk\r\nto the floor. He then begged her to quit. He said to his wife she has\r\nbegged and begged and you have whipped her enough. She only raged 'wus;'\r\nshe turned the butt end of the cowhide and struck me five or six blows\r\nover my head as hard as she could; she then throwed the cowhide down and\r\ntold a little girl to untie me. The little girl was not able to do it;\r\nMr. McCaully then untied me himself. Both times that I was beat the\r\nblood run down from my head to my feet.\r\n\r\n\"They wouldn't give you anything to eat hardly. McCaully bore the name\r\nof coming by free colored children without buying them, and selling them\r\nafterwards. One boy on the place always said that he was free but had\r\nbeen kidnapped from Arkansas. He could tell all about how he was\r\nkidnapped, but could not find anybody to do anything for him, so he had\r\nto content himself.\r\n\r\n\"McCaully bought me from a man by the name of Landers. While in Landers'\r\nhands I had the rheumatism and was not able to work. He was afraid I was\r\ngoing to die, or he would lose me, and I would not be of any service to\r\nhim, so he took and traded me off for a wagon. I was something better\r\nwhen he traded me off; well enough to be about. My health remained bad\r\nfor about four years, and I never got my health until Moore bought me.\r\nMoore took me for a debt. McCaully owed Moore for wagons. I was not born\r\nin Missouri but was born in Virginia. From my earliest memory I was\r\nowned by Conrad Hackler; he lived in Grason County. He was a very poor\r\nman, and had no other slave but me. He bought me before I was quite four\r\nyears old, for one hundred dollars. Hackler bought me from a man named\r\nWilliam Scott. I must go back by good rights to the beginning and tell\r\nall: Scott bought me first from a young man he met one day in the road,\r\nwith a bundle in his arms. Scott, wishing to know of the young man what\r\nhe had in his bundle, was told that he had a baby. 'What are you going\r\nto do with it?' said Scott. The young man said that he was going to take\r\nit to his sister; that its mother was dead, and it had nobody to take\r\ncare of it. Scott offered the young man a horse for it, and the young\r\nman took him up. This is the way I was told that Scott came by me. I\r\nnever knowed anything about my mother or father, but I have always\r\nbelieved that my mother was a white woman, and that I was put away to\r\nsave her character; I have always thought this. Under Hackler I was\r\ntreated more like a brute than a human being. I was fed like the dogs;\r\nhad a trough dug out of a piece of wood for a plate. After I growed up\r\nto ten years old they made me sleep out in an old house standing off\r\nsome distance from the main house where my master and mistress lived. A\r\nbed of straw and old rags was made for me in a big trough called the tan\r\ntrough (a trough having been used for tanning purposes). The cats about\r\nthe place came and slept with me, and was all the company I had. I had\r\nto work with the hoe in the field and help do everything in doors and\r\nout in all weathers. The place was so poor that some seasons he would\r\nnot raise twenty bushels of corn and hardly three bushels of wheat. As\r\nfor shoes I never knowed what it was to have a pair of shoes until I was\r\ngrown up. After I growed up to be a woman my master thought nothing of\r\ntaking my clothes off, and would whip me until the blood would run down\r\nto the ground. After I was twenty-five years old they did not treat me\r\nso bad; they both professed to get religion about that time; and my\r\nmaster said he would never lay the weight of his finger on me again.\r\nOnce after that mistress wanted him to whip me, but he didn't do it, nor\r\nnever whipped me any more. After awhile my master died; if they had gone\r\naccording to law I would have been hired out or sold, but my mistress\r\nwanted to keep me to carry on the place for her support. So I was kept\r\nfor seven or eight years after his death. It was understood between my\r\nmistress, and her children, and her friends, who all met after master\r\ndied, that I was to take care of mistress, and after mistress died I\r\nshould not serve anybody else. I done my best to keep my mistress from\r\nsuffering. After a few years they all became dissatisfied, and moved to\r\nMissouri. They scattered, and took up government land. Without means\r\nthey lived as poor people commonly live, on small farms in the woods. I\r\nstill lived with my mistress. Some of the heirs got dissatisfied, and\r\nsued for their rights or a settlement; then I was sold with my child, a\r\nboy.\"\r\n\r\nThus Aunt Hannah reviewed her slave-life, showing that she had been in\r\nthe hands of six different owners, and had seen great tribulation under\r\neach of them, except the last; that she had never known a mother's or a\r\nfather's care; that Slavery had given her one child, but no husband as a\r\nprotector or a father. The half of what she passed through in the way of\r\nsuffering has scarcely been hinted at in this sketch. Fifty-seven years\r\nwere passed in bondage before she reached Philadelphia. Under the good\r\nProvidence through which she came in possession of her freedom, she\r\nfound a kind home with a family of Abolitionists, (Mrs. Gillingham's),\r\nwhose hearts had been in deep sympathy with the slave for many years. In\r\nthis situation Aunt Hannah remained several years, honest, faithful, and\r\nobliging, taking care of her earnings, which were put out at interest\r\nfor her by her friends. Her mind was deeply imbued with religious\r\nfeeling, and an unshaken confidence in God as her only trust; she\r\nconnected herself with the A.M.E. Bethel Church, of Philadelphia, where\r\nshe has walked, blameless and exemplary up to this day. Probably there\r\nis not a member in that large congregation whose simple faith and whose\r\nwalk and conversation are more commendable than Aunt Hannah's. Although\r\nshe has passed through so many hardships she is a woman of good judgment\r\nand more than average intellect; enjoys good health, vigor, and peace of\r\nmind in her old days, with a small income just sufficient to meet her\r\nhumble wants without having to live at service. After living in\r\nPhiladelphia for several years, she was married to a man of about her\r\nown age, possessing all her good qualities; had served a life-time in a\r\nhighly respectable Quaker family of this city, and had so won the esteem\r\nof his kind employer that at his death he left him a comfortable house\r\nfor life, so that he was not under the necessity of serving another. The\r\nname of the recipient of the good Quaker friend's bounty and Aunt\r\nHannah's companion, was Thomas Todd. After a few years of wedded life,\r\nAunt Hannah was called upon to be left alone again in the world by the\r\ndeath of her husband, whose loss was mourned by many friends, both\r\ncolored and white, who knew and respected him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKIDNAPPING OF RACHEL AND ELIZABETH PARKER--MURDER OF JOSEPH C. MILLER IN\r\n1851 AND 1852.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who were interested in the Anti-Slavery cause, and who kept posted\r\nwith reference to the frequent cases of kidnapping occurring in\r\ndifferent Free States, especially in Pennsylvania, during the twenty\r\nyears previous to emancipation, cannot fail to remember the kidnapping\r\nof Rachel and Elizabeth Parker, and the murder of Joseph C. Miller, who\r\nresided in West Nottingham township, Chester county, Pennsylvania, in\r\nthe latter part of 1851, and the beginning of 1852.\r\n\r\nBoth the kidnapping and the murder at the time of the occurrence shocked\r\nand excited the better thinking and humane classes largely, not only in\r\nPennsylvania, but to a considerable extent over the Northern States. It\r\nmay be said, without contradiction, that Chester county, at least, was\r\nnever more aroused by any one single outrage that had taken place within\r\nher borders, than by these occurrences. For a long while the interest\r\nwas kept alive, and even as lately as the past year (1870), we find the\r\ncase still agitating the citizens of Chester county. Judge Benjamin I.\r\nPassmore, of said county, in defence of truth in an exhaustive article\r\npublished in the \"Village Record,\" West Chester, Oct. 12th, 1870, gives\r\na reliable version of the matter, from beginning to end, which we feel\r\nconstrained to give in full, as possessing great historical value,\r\nbearing on kidnapping in general, especially in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TOM M'CREARY.\r\n\r\n    FRIEND EVANS:--I noticed in the \"Village Record,\" a short time\r\n    since, an article taken from the Delaware \"Transcript,\" an\r\n    obituary notice of the death of the noted character, whose name\r\n    heads this article, in which false statements were made,\r\n    relative to the outrage he committed in kidnapping Rachel and\r\n    Elizabeth Parker, two colored girls who were then, 1851,\r\n    residing in the southern portion of Chester county. In your\r\n    paper of the 13th ult., I also read an answer to the charges and\r\n    insinuations made in the \"Transcript,\" against Joseph C. Miller,\r\n    (whose life was basely destroyed), and other citizens of Chester\r\n    county; as the occurrence took place in my immediate\r\n    neighborhood, and I was familiar with all the facts and\r\n    circumstances, I propose to give a truthful history of that vile\r\n    and wicked transaction.\r\n\r\n    In the winter of 1851, the said McCreary in some unexplained\r\n    way, took Elizabeth Parker, one of the said colored girls, from\r\n    the house of one Donally (not McDonald), in the township of East\r\n    Nottingham, where she was living; but little was said about it\r\n    by Donally, or any one else. Soon after, McCreary with two or\r\n    three others of like proclivities, called at the house of Joseph\r\n    C. Miller, in West Nottingham, where Rachel was living, and\r\n    seized her, gagged her, and placed her in a carriage and drove\r\n    off. The screams of Mrs. Miller and her children, soon brought\r\n    the husband and father to the rescue; he pursued them on foot,\r\n    and at a short distance overtook them in a narrow private road,\r\n    disputing with James Pollock, the owner of the land, whose wagon\r\n    prevented them from passing. They turned and took another road,\r\n    and came out at Stubb's Mill, making for the Maryland line with\r\n    all possible speed; they arrived at Perryville before the train\r\n    for Baltimore. Eli Haines and a young man named Wiley, who lived\r\n    near Rising Sun, Maryland, about two miles from Joseph C.\r\n    Miller's, arrived at the same place soon after, intending to go\r\n    to Philadelphia. Mr. Haines knew Rachel, and seeing McCreary\r\n    there, and her so overwhelmed in sorrow, at once guessed the\r\n    situation of affairs, and he and Wiley changed their intentions\r\n    of going to Philadelphia, and went in the same car with McCreary\r\n    and his victim, to Baltimore, and quietly watched what\r\n    disposition would be made of her, as they felt certain pursuit\r\n    would be made.\r\n\r\n    As soon as possible, after McCreary had escaped from West\r\n    Nottingham, Joseph C. Miller, William Morris, Abner Richardson,\r\n    Jesse B. Kirk, and H.G. Coates, started in pursuit on horseback;\r\n    when they arrived at Perryville, the train had gone, with the\r\n    kidnapper and the girl; they followed in the next train. Soon\r\n    after they arrived in Baltimore, they were met by Haines and\r\n    Wiley, who had been on the lookout for a pursuing party, and\r\n    they gave the information that Rachel was deposited in\r\n    Campbell's slave-pen. They were directed by an acquaintance of\r\n    one of the party, to Francis S. Cochran, a prominent member of\r\n    the Society of Friends. Francis informed them he was well\r\n    acquainted with Campbell, and he at once accompained them.\r\n    Campbell assured Friend Cochran that whilst he approved of\r\n    Slavery and catching runaway slaves, he despised kidnapping and\r\n    kidnappers; and on the arrival of McCreary, he ordered him to\r\n    remove Rachel forthwith, which he proceeded to do. Friend\r\n    Cochran insisted on going with them, and saw the girl deposited\r\n    in jail to await a legal investigation. By this time it was\r\n    evening, and the Chester county men all went home with Cochran,\r\n    where they had their suppers; the excitement being great, Friend\r\n    Cochran did not consider it safe for them to go to the depot\r\n    direct; he procured their tickets and had them driven by a\r\n    circuitous route to the depot, charging them to keep together,\r\n    and take their seats in the cars at once. Soon after they were\r\n    seated and before the cars started, Miller stepped out on the\r\n    platform to smoke, against the expostulations of his friends.\r\n    Jesse B. Kirk, his brother-in-law and Abner Richardson followed\r\n    immediately, and although they were right at his heels, he was\r\n    gone; they called him by name, and stepped down into the crowd,\r\n    but soon became alarmed for their own safety, and returned to\r\n    their seats. A consultation was held, and it was agreed that\r\n    Wiley, who was least known, and not directly identified with the\r\n    affair, should pass through the train when it started, and see\r\n    if Miller had not mistakenly got into another car. At Stemen's\r\n    Run station, Wiley returned to the party with the sad tidings\r\n    that Joseph C. Miller was not in that train. On consultation, it\r\n    was agreed that Jesse B. Kirk and Abner Richardson should return\r\n    from Perryville in the next train, and prosecute further search\r\n    for Miller. They did so return, and McCreary also returned to\r\n    Baltimore in the same car, he having left Baltimore in the car\r\n    in the evening with the Chester county men; they arrived late in\r\n    the night, and locked themselves up in a room in the first hotel\r\n    they came to. Their search was fruitless, and they were forced\r\n    to return home with the sad tidings that Miller could not be\r\n    found. This intelligence aroused the whole neighborhood; public\r\n    meetings were held to consult about what was best to be done.\r\n    The writer presided at one of those meetings, which was largely\r\n    attended, and it was with difficulty that the people could be\r\n    restrained from organizing an armed force to kidnap and lynch\r\n    McCreary. Better counsels, however, finally prevailed and it was\r\n    resolved to send a party to Baltimore to prosecute further the\r\n    search for Miller. About twenty men volunteered for the service;\r\n    I went to the house of Joseph C. Miller, the morning they were\r\n    to start, but they had met at Lewis Mellrath's, a brother-in-law\r\n    of Miller. I was there endeavoring to console the aged mother\r\n    and distracted wife and children of Joseph C. Miller, when word\r\n    came that he had been found hanging to a limb in the bushes near\r\n    Stemen's Run station, and such a scene of distress I hope may\r\n    never again be my lot to witness; it was heart-rending in the\r\n    extreme.\r\n\r\n    The party went to Baltimore, and such was the excitement that it\r\n    was considered unsafe for the party to go out in a body in\r\n    day-time. Levi K. Brown, who then resided in Baltimore, went\r\n    with them by moonlight, and they disinterred the body, which\r\n    they found about two feet under ground, in a rough box, with a\r\n    narrow lid that freely admitted the dirt to surround his body in\r\n    the box. No undertaker in Baltimore could be found that would\r\n    allow the body left at his place of business whilst a coffin was\r\n    prepared, and it was deposited in \"Friends'\" vault; a coffin was\r\n    finally procured and William Morris and Abner Richardson started\r\n    with it for his home. When they arrived at Perryville no one\r\n    would render them any assistance, and they were compelled to\r\n    leave the corpse in an old saw mill, and walk up to Port\r\n    Deposit, a distance of five miles, in the night, the weather\r\n    being extremely cold, and a deep snow on the ground. There they\r\n    procured horses and a sled and started with the body, but when\r\n    within a short distance of the Pennsylvania line they were\r\n    overtaken by a messenger with a requisition from the Governor of\r\n    Maryland to return the body to Baltimore county, in order that\r\n    an inquisition and post-mortem examination might be held in\r\n    legal form. With sorrowful hearts they turned back; (one of\r\n    these young men told me that at no place south of Port Deposit\r\n    could they get any one to assist them in handling the corpse).\r\n    By this time the affair had created a great excitement, both in\r\n    Chester county and the City of Baltimore. Rev. John M. Dickey,\r\n    Hon. Henry S. Evans, then a member of the Senate. Brinton\r\n    Darlington, then Sheriff of Chester county, and very many of the\r\n    leading men took a deep interest in the matter; we all did our\r\n    part. The Society of Friends in Baltimore took the matter in\r\n    hand, and many other worthy citizens belonging to the\r\n    Presbyterian Church and others lent their aid and influence.\r\n    Hon. Henry S. Evans, who was then in the Senate of Pennsylvania,\r\n    brought the matter before the Legislature, and the result was\r\n    that the Governor appointed Judges Campbell and Bell, the latter\r\n    of our county, to defend these two poor colored girls thus\r\n    foully kidnapped.\r\n\r\n    The body of Miller underwent a post-mortem examination in\r\n    Baltimore county, at which a great number of rowdies attended,\r\n    who occupied their time drinking whisky and cursing the\r\n    Pennsylvania Abolitionists; the body finally reached its\r\n    distressed home for interment. Drs. Hutchinson and Dickey were\r\n    called upon to make an examination, at which I was present, and\r\n    all were clearly of opinion that he had been foully murdered.\r\n    His wrists and ankles bore the unmistakable marks of manacles;\r\n    across the abdomen was a black mark as if made by a rope or\r\n    cord; the end of his nose bore marks as if held by some\r\n    instrument of torture. His funeral took place, and his remains\r\n    were followed to the grave by an immense concourse of\r\n    sympathizing friends and neighbors.\r\n\r\n    Such, however, was the excitement, that the public demanded a\r\n    further examination; he was disinterred again, and the same two\r\n    eminent physicians made a thorough post-mortem examination, and\r\n    one of them told the writer that there were not two ounces of\r\n    contents in his stomach and bowels, and that there was abundant\r\n    evidence of the presence of arsenic. His remains were again\r\n    interred and suffered to remain undisturbed.\r\n\r\n    The theory of his friends was that he had been suddenly snatched\r\n    from the platform of the car in the Baltimore Depot, gagged,\r\n    stripped, and lashed down by the ankles and wrists, and a rope\r\n    across his abdomen, that his nose had been held by some\r\n    instrument, and that he was in this situation drenched with\r\n    arsenic, and puked and purged to death, and that McCreary, or\r\n    some one for him, had heard Wiley repeat at Stemen's Run\r\n    Station, that he was not on the train, conceived the idea of\r\n    taking his body there and hanging it to a tree to convey the\r\n    idea that he had committed suicide at that place, and such was\r\n    the statement published by some of the Maryland newspapers. His\r\n    companions said he eat a very hearty supper that evening at\r\n    Francis S. Cochran's, which with the other facts that his\r\n    clothing were not soiled, and his stomach and bowels were empty,\r\n    goes strongly to substantiate the theory that he had been\r\n    stripped and foully murdered, as above indicated. Never was\r\n    there a more false assertion than that the \"broad brimmed\r\n    Quakers in Pennsylvania were accomplices of McCreary,\" as it is\r\n    well known that opposition to slavery has been a cardinal\r\n    principle of the Society of Friends for a century. And that\r\n    Joseph C. Miller committed suicide because of his being\r\n    implicated in the kidnapping is a base fabrication. I knew\r\n    Joseph C. Miller from boyhood intimately, and I here take\r\n    pleasure in saying that he was an honest, unassuming man, of\r\n    good moral character and stern integrity, and would have spurned\r\n    the idea of any complication, directly or indirectly, with\r\n    slavery or kidnapping.\r\n\r\n    It appears his foul murder was not sufficient to satisfy the\r\n    friends of slavery and kidnapping, but an attempt is now made,\r\n    after the victim has slumbered near twenty years in the grave,\r\n    to blast his good name by insinuating that he was a party, or\r\n    implicated in the vile transactions here narrated.\r\n\r\n    Rachel remained in jail; Elizabeth, who had been sold to parties\r\n    in New Orleans, was sent for by Campbell, ample security having\r\n    been given that she should be returned if proved to be a slave.\r\n    Their trial finally came on, and after a long and tedious\r\n    investigation they were both proven, by hosts of respectable\r\n    witnesses to be free. They returned to their mother, in Chester\r\n    county, who was still living.\r\n\r\n    The Grand Jury of Chester county found a true bill against\r\n    McCreary for kidnapping, a requisition was obtained, and B.\r\n    Darlington, Esq., then High Sheriff, proceeded with it to\r\n    Annapolis; but the Governor of Maryland refused to allow\r\n    McCreary to be arrested in that State.\r\n\r\n    Thus terminated this terrible affair, which cost the State of\r\n    Pennsylvania nearly $3000, as well as a heavy expense to many\r\n    citizens of Baltimore, and those of this county who took an\r\n    active part, and whilst it is to be hoped that the principal\r\n    actor in this sad transaction fully atoned for his evil deeds,\r\n    whilst living, and his friends may have had a right to eulogize\r\n    him after death, they should not have gone out of their way to\r\n    traduce other parties, dead and alive, whose reputations were\r\n    known by living witnesses, to be beyond reproach.\r\n\r\n    JUSTICE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM VIRGINIA, 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUCKER WHITE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTucker reported that he fled from Major Isaac Roney, of Dinwiddie\r\nCourt-House, Virginia, in the Christmas week prior to his arrival; that\r\nhe reached Petersburg and then encountered difficulties of the most\r\ntrying nature; he next stopped at City Point, and was equally\r\nunfortunate there. From exposure in the cold he was severely\r\nfrost-bitten. While suffering from the frost he was kept in the\r\npoor-house. After partial recovery he made his way to Baltimore and\r\nthence to Philadelphia. Once or twice he was captured and carried back.\r\nThe Committee suspected that he was a cunning impostor who had learned\r\nhow to tell a tale of suffering simply to excite the sympathies of the\r\nbenevolent; yet, with the map of Virginia before them, he proved himself\r\nfamiliar with localities adjacent to the neighborhood in which he was\r\nraised. Although not satisfied with his statement, the Committee decided\r\nto aid him.\r\n\r\nPassmore Williamson, who had taken a deep interest in the examination of\r\nhis case, in order to ascertain the facts, addressed the following note\r\nto Major Roney, using as his signature the name of his friend, Wm. J.\r\nCanby:\r\n\r\n\r\n    PHILADELPHIA, June 24, 1854.\r\n\r\n    MAJOR ISAAC RONEY:\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:--Within a few days past a colored man has been\r\n    traversing the streets of this city, exciting the sympathies of\r\n    the benevolent by the recital of a tale of the hardships he has\r\n    lately passed through. He represents himself to be Tucker White,\r\n    your slave, a carpenter by trade, and that he escaped from your\r\n    service last Christmas. He is quite dark in complexion, rather\r\n    over the medium size, and a little lame; the latter, probably,\r\n    from the effects of frost on his feet, from which, he alleges,\r\n    he suffered severely.\r\n\r\n    He seems to be well acquainted with the adjoining localities,\r\n    but altogether his narrative is almost incredible, and I am\r\n    therefore induced to make the inquiry whether such a man has\r\n    escaped from your service or lately left your neighborhood. We\r\n    are perfectly flooded with such vagrants. It would be a great\r\n    relief if some measures could be resorted to to keep them under\r\n    legal restraint. An answer addressed to No. 73 South 4th Street,\r\n    above Walnut, will reach me, and oblige, Yours, &c.\r\n\r\n    WM. J. CANBY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeeks passed, but no answer came from the Major. All hope was abandoned\r\nof obtaining a more satisfactory clue to the history of Tucker White.\r\nAbout three months, however, after Mr. Williamson had written, the\r\nappended note came as an answer:\r\n\r\n\r\n    MR. CANBY:\r\n\r\n    Major Roney received a letter from you relative to his boy,\r\n    Tucker White, and has sent me here to inquire of you his\r\n    whereabouts now. If you know anything concerning him and will\r\n    give me such information so I can get him, you will be rewarded\r\n    for your trouble. You will please address,\r\n\r\n    No. 147 American Hotel.\r\n\r\n    The Major would have sent on sooner but he has been sick, and\r\n    the letter laid in Office several days.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Canby was at the time ill, and no attention was paid to the\r\ncommunication. After a day's delay the following note came to hand, but,\r\nas in the former instance, no answer was returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MR. CANBY:\r\n\r\n    You will confer a great favor on me by writing me whether you\r\n    were really the author of a letter to Major Isaac Roney, of\r\n    Dinwiddie Court House, Va., relative to his boy Tucker White,\r\n    and if you were the author, please let me know when you last saw\r\n    him, and where. I called at your office yesterday to see you,\r\n    but your cousin (I think he said he was) told me you had the\r\n    cholera, and if you felt well enough you were going to the\r\n    country to-morrow. I hope you will excuse my writing to you\r\n    to-day, on that account. I would not know where to direct a\r\n    letter if I were to wait until to-morrow. If you know anything\r\n    concerning him and will let me know it, so that I can find and\r\n    arrest him, you will very much oblige\r\n\r\n    Yours, &c.,\r\n\r\n    I.M. TUCKER.\r\n\r\n    No. 147 American Hotel.\r\n\r\n    Please write me an answer to-day, so I may know how to proceed\r\n    to-morrow. If I find him I will be very happy to see you before\r\n    I leave in behalf of Major Roney, in whose business I am now\r\n    engaged. I.M.T.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome one, however, who had a hand in the first letter, referred the\r\nMajor to Passmore Williamson, Seventh and Arch Streets. To Mr.\r\nWilliamson's surprise the individual who had addressed Mr. C. appeared\r\nat his office with the identical letter in his hand that had been\r\naddressed him by Mr. W. (with W.J.C.'s signature.) On addressing Mr. W.\r\nhe held out the letter and inquired: \"Are you the author of this letter,\r\nsir?\" Mr. W. looked at it and remarked that it appeared to have been\r\nwritten by a man named Canby. \"My name is Williamson, but if you will\r\nwalk in and take a seat I will attend to you in a few moments.\"\r\nAccordingly, after occupying a little time in adjusting some papers, he\r\nsignified to the stranger that he was ready to answer any of his\r\nquestions. Said Mr. W., \"I say frankly that I am the author of that\r\nletter.\" He then paused for a reply. The stranger then said, \"I have\r\ncome from Virginia in behalf of Major Roney, in search of his boy,\r\nTucker White; the Major was very anxious to recover him, and he would\r\ngladly reward Mr. W. or anybody else who would aid him in the matter.\"\r\nHe then asked Mr. W. if he knew anything of his whereabouts. Mr. W.\r\nreplied: \"I do not at present; for a long time I have heard nothing of\r\nhim. I must tell you that I am very sorry that Major Roney gave himself\r\nthe trouble to send all the way to Philadelphia to re-capture his 'boy\r\nTucker White,' and with regard to giving information or assistance, I\r\nknow of but one or two men in this city who would be mean enough to\r\nstoop to do such dirty work. Geo. F. Alberti, a notorious kidnapper, and\r\nE.D. Ingraham, equally as notorious as a counsel of slave-hunters whom\r\neverybody here despises, might have served you in this matter. I know no\r\nothers to recommend; if anybody can find the 'boy,' they can. But should\r\nthey find him they will be obliged to take legal steps in arresting him\r\nbefore they can proceed. In such a case, instead of assisting Major\r\nRoney, I should feel bound to assist Tucker White by throwing every\r\nobstacle that I possibly could in the way of his being carried back to\r\nVirginia; and to close the matter I wish it to be understood that I do\r\nnot desire to hold any further correspondence with Major Roney, of\r\nDinwiddie, Virginia, about his 'boy,' Tucker White.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL FROM NORFOLK.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARY MILLBURN, _alias_ LOUISA F. JONES, ESCAPED IN MALE ATTIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeither in personal appearance, manners, nor language, were any traces\r\nof the Peculiar Institution visible in Mary Millburn. On the contrary,\r\nshe represented a young lady, with a passable education, and very\r\nrefined in her deportment. She had eaten the white bread of Slavery,\r\nunder the Misses Chapman, and they had been singularly kind to her,\r\ntaking special pains with her in regard to the company she should keep,\r\na point important to young girls, so liable to exposure as were the\r\nunprotected young females of the South. She being naturally of a happy\r\ndisposition, obliging, competent, there was but little room for any jars\r\nin the household, so far as Mary was concerned. Notwithstanding all\r\nthis, she was not satisfied; Slavery in its most dreaded aspect, was all\r\naround her, continually causing the heart to bleed and eyes to weep of\r\nboth young and old. The auction-block and slave-pen were daily in view.\r\nYoung girls as promising as herself, she well knew, had to be exposed,\r\nexamined, and sold to the vilest slave-holders living.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nWith her knowledge of the practical wickedness of the system, how could\r\nshe be satisfied? It was impossible! She determined to escape. She could\r\nbe accommodated, but with no favored mode of travel. No flowery beds of\r\nease could be provided in her case, any more than in the case of others.\r\nMary took the Underground Rail Road enterprise into consideration. The\r\nopportunity of a passage on a steamer was before her to accept or\r\nrefuse. The spirit of freedom dictated that she should accept the offer\r\nand leave by the first boat. Admonished that she could reach the boat\r\nand also travel more safely in male attire she at once said, \"Any way so\r\nI succeed.\" It is not to be supposed for a moment, that the effort could\r\nbe made without encountering a great \"fight of affliction.\" When the\r\nhour arrived for the boat to start, Mary was nicely secreted in a box\r\n(place), where she was not discovered when the officers made their usual\r\nsearch. On arriving in Philadelphia, she mingled her rejoicings with the\r\nCommittee in testifying to the great advantage of the Underground Rail\r\nRoad, and to the carefulness of its agents in guarding against\r\naccidents. After remaining a short time in Philadelphia, she made choice\r\nof Boston as her future residence, and with a letter of introduction to\r\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, she proceeded thitherward. How she was received,\r\nand what she thought of the place and people, may be gleaned from this\r\nletter (written by herself.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    BOSTON, May 15th, 1858.\r\n\r\n    DEAR FRIEND:--I have selected this oppotunity to write you a few\r\n    lines, hopeing thay may find you and yours enjoying helth and\r\n    happiness. I arrived hear on Thirsday last, and had a lettor of\r\n    intoduction giving to me by one of the gentlemen at the\r\n    Antoslavery office in New York, to Mr. Garrison in Boston, I\r\n    found him and his lady both to bee very clever. I stopped with\r\n    them the first day of my arrivel hear, since that Time I have\r\n    been living with Mrs. Hilliard I have met with so menny of my\r\n    acquaintances hear, that I all most immagion my self to bee in\r\n    the old country. I have not been to Canaday yet, as you\r\n    expected. I had the pleasure of seeing the lettor that you wrote\r\n    to them on the subject. I suffered much on the road with head\r\n    ake but since that time I have no reason to complain, please do\r\n    not for git to send the degarritips in the Shaimpain basket with\r\n    Dr. Lundys, Mr. Lesley said he will send them by express, tell\r\n    Julia kelly, that through mistake, I took one of her pocket\r\n    handkerchift, that was laying on the table, but I shall keep it\r\n    in remembranc of the onner. I must bring my lettor to a close as\r\n    I have nothing more to say, and believe me to be your faithfull\r\n    friend.\r\n\r\n    LOUISA P. JONES.\r\n\r\n    P.S. Remember me to each, and every member of your familly and\r\n    all Enquiring Friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing of an industrious turn she found a situation immediately, and from\r\nthat day to the present, she has sustained an excellent character in\r\nevery respect, and as a fashionable dressmaker does a good business.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL OF FIFTEEN FROM NORFOLK, VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER SCHOONER--TWICE SEARCHED--LANDED AT LEAGUE ISLAND.\r\n\r\nISAAC FORMAN, HENRY WILLIAMS, WILLIAM SEYMOUR, HARRIET TAYLOR, MARY\r\nBIRD, MRS. LEWEY, SARAH SAUNDERS, SOPHIA GRAY, HENRY GRAY, MARY GRAY,\r\nWINFIELD SCOTT, and three children.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the 4th of July, 1856, a message reached the Secretary that a\r\nschooner containing fifteen Underground Rail Road passengers, from\r\nNorfolk, Virginia, would be landed near League Island, directly at the\r\nfoot of Broad street, that evening at a late hour, and a request\r\naccompanied the message, to the effect that the Committee would be on\r\nhand to receive them. Accordingly the Secretary procured three\r\ncarriages, with trustworthy drivers, and between ten and eleven o'clock\r\nat night arrived on the banks of the Schuylkill, where all was quiet as\r\na \"country grave-yard.\" The moon was shining and soon the mast of a\r\nschooner was discovered. No sign of any other vessel was then in sight.\r\nOn approaching the bank, in the direction of the discovered mast, the\r\nschooner was also discovered. The hearts of those on board were swelling\r\nwith unutterable joy; yet even at that dead hour of night, far away from\r\nall appearance of foes, no one felt at liberty to give vent to his\r\nfeelings other than in a whisper. The name of the captain and schooner\r\nbeing at once recognized, the first impulse was to jump down on the\r\ndeck. Upon second view it was seen that the descent was too great to\r\nadmit of such a feat. In a moment we concluded that we could pull them\r\nup the embankment from the deck by taking hold of their hands as they\r\nstood on tip toe.\r\n\r\nOne after another was pulled up, and warmly greeted, until it came the\r\nturn of a large object, weighing about two hundred and sixty pounds,\r\nfull large enough to make two ordinary women. The captain, who had\r\nexperienced much inconvenience with her on the voyage, owing to the\r\nspace she required chuckled over the fact that the Committee would have\r\ntheir hands full for once. Poor Mrs. Walker, however, stretched out her\r\nlarge arms, we seized her hands vigorously; the captain laughing\r\nheartily as did the other passengers at the tug now being made. We\r\npulled with a will, but Mrs. Walker remained on the deck. A one horse\r\npower was needed. The pullers took breath, and again took hold, this\r\ntime calling upon the captain to lay-to a helping hand; the captain\r\nprepared to do so, and as she was being raised, he having a good\r\nfoot-hold, placed himself in a position for pushing to the full extent\r\nof his powers, and thus she was safely landed. All being placed in the\r\ncarriages, they were driven to the station and comfortably provided for.\r\n\r\nOn the voyage they had encountered more than the usual dangers. Indeed\r\ntroubles began with them before they had set sail from Norfolk. The\r\nfirst indication of danger manifested itself as they stood on the bank\r\nof the river awaiting the arrival of a small boat which had been engaged\r\nto row them to the schooner. Although they had sought as they supposed a\r\nsafe place, sufficiently far from the bounds usually traversed by the\r\npolice; still, in the darkness, they imagined they heard watchmen\r\ncoming. Just on the edge of the river, opposite where they were waiting,\r\na boat under repairs was in the stocks. In order to evade the advancing\r\nfoe, they all marched into the river, the water being shallow, and with\r\nthe vessel for a breastwork hiding them from the shore, there they\r\nremained for an hour and a half. They were thoroughly soaked if nothing\r\nmore. However, about ten o'clock a small oyster boat came to their\r\nrelief, and all were soon placed aboard the schooner, which was loaded\r\nwith corn, etc. All, with the exception of the large woman above\r\nreferred to, and one other female, were required to enter a hole\r\napparently leading through the bottom of the boat, but in reality only a\r\ndepartment which had been expressly constructed for the Underground Rail\r\nRoad business, at the expense of the captain, and in accordance with his\r\nown plan.\r\n\r\nThe entrance was not sufficiently large to admit Mrs. Walker, so she\r\nwith another female who was thought \"too fat\" to endure the close\r\nconfinement, was secreted behind some corn back of the cabin, a place so\r\nsecluded that none save well-experienced searchers would be likely to\r\nfind it. In this way the Captain put out to sea. After some fifteen\r\nhours he deemed it safe to bring his passengers up on deck where they\r\ncould inhale pure air which was greatly needed, as they had been\r\nnext-door to suffocation and death. The change of air had such an effect\r\non one of the passengers (Scott) that, in his excitement, he refused to\r\nconform to the orders required; for prudential reasons the Captain,\r\nthreatened to throw him over-board. Whereupon Scott lowered his tone.\r\nBefore reaching the lock the Captain supposing that they might be in\r\ndanger from contact with boats, men, etc., again called upon them \"to go\r\ninto their hole\" under the deck. Not even the big woman was excused now.\r\nShe pleaded that she could not get through, her fellow-sufferers said\r\nthat she must be got through urging the matter on the ground that they\r\nwould have great danger to face. The big woman again tried to effect an\r\nentrance, but in vain. Said one of the more resolute sisters \"she must\r\ntake off her clothes then, it will never do to have her staying up on\r\ndeck to betray all the rest;\" thus this resolute stand being unanimous,\r\nthe poor woman had to comply, and except a single garment she was as\r\ndestitute of raiment as was Mother Eve before she induced Adam to eat of\r\nthe forbidden fruit in the garden of Eden. With the help of passengers\r\nbelow, she was squeezed through, but not without bruising and breaking\r\nthe skin considerably where the rub was severest. All were now beneath\r\nthe deck, the well-fitting oil-cloth was put over the hole covering the\r\ncabin-floor snugly, and a heavy table was set over the hole. They are\r\nwithin sight of the lock, but no human beings are visible about the\r\nschooner save the Captain, the mate and a small boy, the son of the\r\nCaptain. At the lock not unexpectedly three officers came on board of\r\nthe boat and stopped her. The Captain was told that they had received a\r\ntelegraphic dispatch from Norfolk to the effect that his boat was\r\nsuspected of having slaves secreted thereon. They talked with the\r\nCaptain and mate separately for a considerable while, and more closely\r\ndid they examine the boy, but gained no information except that \"the\r\nyellow-fever had been raging very bad in Norfolk.\" At this fever-news\r\nthe officers were not a little alarmed, and they now lost no time in\r\nattending to their official errand. They searched the cabin where the\r\ntwo fat women were first secreted, and other parts of the boat pretty\r\nthoroughly. They then commenced taking up the hatchways, but the place\r\nseemed so shockingly perfumed with foul air that the men started back\r\nand declared that nobody could live in such a place, and swore that it\r\nsmelt like the yellow-fever; the Captain laughed at them, and signified\r\nthat they were perfectly welcome to search to their hearts' content. The\r\nofficers concluded that there were no slaves on that boat, that nobody\r\ncould live there, etc., etc., asked for their charges ($3), and\r\ndischarged the Captain. The children had been put under the influence of\r\nliquor to keep them still, so they made no noise; the others endured\r\ntheir hour of agony patiently until the lock was safely passed, and the\r\nriver reached. Fresh air was then allowed them, and the great danger was\r\nconsidered overcome. The Captain, however, far from deeming it advisable\r\nto land his live cargo at the wharves of Philadelphia, delivered them at\r\nLeague Island. The passengers testified that Captain B. was very kind.\r\nThey were noticed thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIsaac, was about fifty years of age, dark, tall, well-made, intelligent,\r\nand was owned by George Brown, who resided at Deep Creek. Isaac\r\ntestified that said Brown had invariably treated him cruelly. For thirty\r\nyears Isaac had hired his time, found himself in food, clothing, and\r\neverything, yet as he advanced in years, neither his task, nor his hire\r\nwas diminished, but on the contrary his hire of late years had been\r\nincreased. He winced under the pressure, and gave himself up to the\r\nstudy of the Underground Rail Road. While arrangements for fleeing were\r\npending, he broke the secret to his wife, Polly, in whom he trusted; she\r\nbeing true to freedom, although sorrowing to part with him, threw no\r\nobstacle in his way. Besides his wife, he had also two daughters, Amanda\r\nA. and Mary Jane, both slaves. Nevertheless, having made up his mind not\r\nto die a slave, he resolved to escape at all hazards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenderson belonged to the estate of A. Briggs, which was about to be\r\nsettled, and knowing that he was accounted on the inventory as personal\r\nproperty, he saw that he too would be sold with the rest of the\r\nmovables, if he was not found among the missing.\r\n\r\nHe began to consider what he had endured as a slave, and came to the\r\nconclusion that he had had a \"rugged road to hoe all the way along\" and\r\nthat he might have it much worse if he waited to be sold. The voice of\r\nreason admonished him to escape for his life. In obeying this call he\r\nsuffered the loss of his wife, Julia, and two children, who were\r\nfortunately free. Henderson was about thirty-one years of age, stout,\r\nand of healthy appearance, worth in cash perhaps $1200.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam was thirty-four years of age, of a chestnut color, substantial\r\nphysical structure, and of good faculties. The man who professed to own\r\nhim he called William Taylor, and \"he was a very hard man, one of the\r\nkind which could not be pleased, nor give a slave a pleasant answer one\r\ntime in fifty.\" Being thoroughly sick of William Taylor, he fell in love\r\nwith the Underground Rail Road and Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Walker, the big fat woman, was thirty-eight years of age, and a\r\npleasant-looking person, of a very dark hue. Besides the struggles\r\nalready alluded to, she was obliged to leave her husband. Of her master\r\nshe declared that she could \"say nothing good.\" His name was Arthur\r\nCooper, of Georgetown; she had never lived with him, however; for twenty\r\nyears she had hired her time, paying five dollars per month. When young\r\nshe scarcely thought of the gross wrongs that were heaped upon her; but\r\nas she grew older, and thought more about her condition, she scouted the\r\nidea that God had designed her to be a slave, and decided that she would\r\nbe one to leave Dixey in the first Underground Rail Road train that\r\nmight afford her the chance. She determined not to remain even for the\r\nsake of her husband, who was a slave. With such a will, therefore, she\r\nstarted. Upon leaving Philadelphia, she went with the most of her\r\ncompany to Boston, and thence to New Bedford, where she was living when\r\nlast heard from.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRebecca Lewey was the wife of a man, who was familiarly known by the\r\nname of \"Blue Beard,\" his proper name being Henry Lewey. For a long\r\ntime, although a slave himself, he was one of the most dexterous\r\nmanagers in the Underground Rail Road agency in Norfolk. No single\r\nchapter in this work could be more interesting than a chapter of his\r\nexploits in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe appearing of Mrs. Lewey, was a matter of unusual interest. Although\r\nshe had worn the yoke, she was gentle in her manners, and\r\nhealthy-looking, so much so that no life insurance agent would have had\r\nneed to subject her to medical examination before insuring her. She was\r\ntwenty-eight years of age, but had never known personal abuse as a\r\nslave; she was none the less anxious, however, to secure her freedom.\r\nHer husband, Blue Beard, judging from certain signs, that he was\r\nsuspected by slave-holders, and might at any time be caged, (indeed he\r\nhad recently been in the lions' den, but got out); in order to save his\r\nwife, sent her on in advance as he had decided to follow her soon in a\r\nsimilar manner. Rebecca was not without hope of again meeting her\r\nhusband. This desire was gratified before many months had passed, as he\r\nwas fortunate enough to make his way to Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMary Knight was a single woman, twenty-six years of age, dark, stout,\r\nand of pleasing manners; she complained of having been used hard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Saunders had been claimed as the property of Richard Gatewood, a\r\nclerk in the naval service. According to Sarah he was a very clever\r\nslave-holder, and had never abused her. Nor was she aware that he had\r\never treated any of his servants cruelly. Sarah, however, had not lived\r\nin Gatewood's immediate family, but had been allowed to remain with her\r\ngrandmother, rather as a privileged character. She was young, fair, and\r\nprepossessing. Having a sister living in Philadelphia, who was known to\r\nthe agent in Norfolk, Sarah was asked one day if she would not like to\r\nsee her sister. She at once answered \"Yes.\" After further conversation\r\nthe agent told her that if she would keep the matter entirely private,\r\nhe would arrange for her to go by the Underground Rail Road. Being\r\nwilling and anxious to go, she promised due obedience to the rules; she\r\nwas not told, however, how much she would have to pass through on the\r\nway, else, according to her own admission, she never would have come as\r\nshe did; her heart would have failed her. But when the goal was gained,\r\nlike all others, she soon forgot her sufferings, and rejoiced heartily\r\nat getting out of Slavery, even though her condition had not been so bad\r\nas that of many others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSophia Gray, with her son and daughter, Henry and Mary, was from\r\nPortsmouth. The mother was a tall, yellow woman, with well cut features,\r\nabout thirty-three years of age, with manners indicative of more than\r\nordinary intelligence. The son and daughter were between twelve and\r\nfourteen years of age; well-developed for their age, modest, and\r\nfinely-formed mulattoes. All the material necessary for a story of great\r\ninterest, might have readily been found in the story of the mother and\r\nher children. They were sent with others to New Bedford, Massachusetts.\r\nIt was not long after being in New Bedford, before the boy was put to a\r\ntrade, and the daughter was sent to Boston, where she had an aunt (a\r\nfugitive), living in the family of the Hon. George S. Hilliard. Mr. and\r\nMrs. Hilliard were so impressed by Mary's intelligent countenance and\r\nher appearance generally, that they decided that she must have a chance\r\nfor an education, and opened their hearts and home to her.\r\n\r\nOn a visit to Boston, in 1859, the writer found Mary at Mr. Hilliard's,\r\nand in an article written for the \"Anti-Slavery Standard,\" upon the\r\ncondition of fugitive slaves in Boston and New Bedford, allusion was\r\nmade particularly to her and several others, under this hospitable roof,\r\nin the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n\"On arriving in Boston, the first persons I had the pleasure to converse\r\nwith, were four or five uncommonly interesting Underground Rail Road\r\npassengers, who had only been out of bondage between three and five\r\nyears. Their intelligent appearance contradicted the idea that they had\r\never been an hour in Slavery, or a mile on an Underground Rail Road. Two\r\nof them were filling trustworthy posts, where they were respected and\r\nwell paid for their services. Two others were young people (one two, and\r\nthe other three years out of Slavery), a girl of fifteen, and a boy of\r\ntwelve, whose interesting appearance induced a noble-hearted\r\nAnti-Slavery lady to receive them into her own family, expressly to\r\neducate them; and thus, almost ever since their arrival, they have been\r\nenjoying this lady's kindness, as well as the excellent equal Free\r\nSchool privileges of Boston. The girl, in the Grammar School (chiefly\r\ncomposed of whites), has already distinguished herself, having received\r\na diploma, with an excellent certificate of character; and the boy,\r\nnaturally very apt, has made astonishing progress.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"boy of twelve,\" alluded to, was not Mary's brother. He was quite a\r\ngenius of his age, who had escaped from Norfolk, stowed away in a\r\nschooner and was known by the name of \"Dick Page.\"\r\n\r\nOn arriving in Philadelphia, Dick was delivered, as usual, into the\r\nhands of the Committee. The extraordinary smartness of the little fellow\r\n(only ten years old), astonished all who saw him. The sympathies of a\r\nkind-hearted gentleman and his wife, living in Philadelphia, had been\r\ndeeply awakened in his behalf, through their relative and friend, Mrs.\r\nHilliard, in whose family, as has been already stated, the boy's aunt\r\nlived. So much were these friends interested to secure Dick's freedom,\r\nthat they often contemplated buying him, although they did not like the\r\nidea of buying, as the money would go into the pocket of the master, who\r\nthey considered had no just right to deprive any individual of his\r\nfreedom. So when Dick arrived the Committee felt that it was as little\r\nas they could do, to give these friends the pleasure of seeing the\r\nlittle Underground Rail Road passenger. He was therefore conveyed to the\r\nresidence of Prof. J.P. Lesley. He could not have been sent to a house\r\nin the great city of Brotherly Love, where he would have found a more\r\ncordial and sincere reception. After passing an hour or so with them,\r\nDick was brought away, but he had been so touched by their kindness,\r\nthat he felt that he must see them again, before leaving the city; so\r\njust before sundown, one evening, he was missed; search was made for\r\nhim, but in vain. Great anxiety was felt for him, fearing that he was\r\nlost. During the early part of the evening, the writer, with a bell in\r\nhand, passed up one street and down another, in quest of the stranger,\r\nbut no one could give any information of him. Finally about ten o'clock,\r\nthe mayor's office was visited with a view of having the police stations\r\ntelegraphed. Soon the mystery was solved; one of the policemen stated\r\nthat he had noticed a strange colored boy with Professor Lesley's\r\nchildren. Hastening to the residence of the professor, sure enough, Dick\r\nwas there, happy in bed and asleep.\r\n\r\nFrom that time to this, it has been a mystery to know how a boy, a\r\nperfect stranger, could make his way alone, (having passed over the\r\nroute but once), without getting lost, so circuitous was the road that\r\nhe had to travel, in order to reach Professor Lesley's house. Having\r\nsaid this much, the way is now open to refer to him again, in Boston at\r\nschool. He was generously assisted through his education and trade, and\r\nwas prepared to commence life at his majority, an intelligent mechanic,\r\nand a man of promise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CASE OF EUPHEMIA WILLIAMS,\r\n\r\n\r\nCLAIMED AS A FUGITIVE SLAVE UNDER THE FUGITIVE SLAVE-LAW AFTER HAVING\r\nLIVED IN PENNSYLVANIA FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nScarcely had the infamous statute been in existence six months, ere the\r\nworst predictions of the friends of the slave were fulfilled in\r\ndifferent Northern States. It is hardly too much to say, that\r\nPennsylvania was considered wholly unsafe to nine-tenths of her colored\r\npopulation. The kidnapper is fully shown in the case of Rachel and\r\nElizabeth Parker as he appeared on the soil of Pennsylvania, doing his\r\nvile work in the dead of night, entering the homes of unprotected\r\nfemales and children, therefore:\r\n\r\nThe case of Euphemia Williams will serve to represent the milder form of\r\nkidnapping in open day, in the name of the law, by professed Christians\r\nin the city of Brotherly Love, and the home of William Penn.\r\n\r\nFebruary 6, 1851, Euphemia Williams, the mother of six children, the\r\nyoungest at the breast, was arrested in the upper part of the city\r\n(Philadelphia), and hurried before Edward D. Ingraham, a United States\r\ncommissioner, upon the charge of being a fugitive from labor. She was\r\nclaimed by William T.J. Purnell, of Worcester county, Maryland, who\r\nadmitted that she had been away from him for twenty-two years, or since\r\n1829. Her offspring were born on the soil of Pennsylvania, and the\r\neldest daughter was seventeen years of age.\r\n\r\nEuphemia was living in her own house, and had been a member of church,\r\nin good and regular standing, for about seventeen years, and was about\r\nforty years of age. When the arrest was made, Euphemia had just risen\r\nfrom her bed, and was only partly dressed, when a little after daylight,\r\nseveral persons entered her room, and arrested her. Murder! murder! was\r\ncried lustily, and awakened the house. Her children screamed lamentably,\r\nand her eldest daughter cried \"They've got my mother! they've got my\r\nmother!\" \"For God's sake, save me,\" cried Euphemia, to a woman in the\r\nsecond story, who was an eye-witness to this monstrous outrage. But\r\ndespite the piteous appeals of the mother and children, the poor woman\r\nwas hastened into a cab, and borne to the marshall's office.\r\n\r\nThrough the vigilance of J.M. McKim and Passmore Williamson, a writ of\r\nhabeas corpus returnable forthwith was obtained at about one o'clock.\r\nThe heart-broken mother was surrounded by five of her children, three of\r\nwhom were infants. It was a dark and dreadful hour. When her children\r\nwere brought into the room where she was detained, great drops of sweat\r\nstanding on her face plainly indicated her agony.\r\n\r\nBy mutual arrangement between the claimants and the prisoner's counsel\r\nthe hearing was fixed for the next day, at the hour of three o'clock.\r\nAccording to said arrangement, at three o'clock Euphemia was brought\r\nface to face with her claimant, William T.J. Purnell. The news had\r\nalready gone out that the trial would come off at the time fixed; hence\r\na multitude were on hand to witness the proceedings in the case. The\r\nsympathy of anti-slavery ladies was excited, and many were present in\r\nthe court-room to manifest their feelings in behalf of the stricken\r\nwoman. The eloquent David Paul Brown (the terror of slave-hunters) and\r\nWilliam S. Pierce, Esqrs., appeared for Euphemia, R.C. McMurtrie, Esq.,\r\nfor the claimant.\r\n\r\nMr. McMurtrie in the outset, arose and said, that it was with extreme\r\nregret that he saw an attempt to influence the decision of this case by\r\ntumult and agitation. The sympathy shown by so many friendly ladies, was\r\nnot a favorable sign for the slave-holder. Notwithstanding, Mr.\r\nMcMurtrie said that he would \"prove that Mahala, sometimes called Mahala\r\nPurnell, was born and bred a slave of Dr. George W. Purnell, of\r\nWorcester county, Maryland, who was in the habit of hiring her to the\r\nneighbors, and while under a contract of hiring, she escaped with a boy,\r\nwith whom she had taken up, belonging to the person who hired her.\" The\r\npresent claimant claimed her as the administrator of Dr. George W.\r\nPurnell.\r\n\r\nIn order to sustain this claim many witnesses and much positive swearing\r\nwere called forth. Robert F. Bowen, the first witness, swore that he\r\nknew both Mahala and her master perfectly well, that he had worked as a\r\ncarpenter in helping to build a house for the latter, and also had hired\r\nthe former directly from her owner.\r\n\r\nDefinite time and circumstances were all harmoniously fixed by this\r\nleading witness. One of the important circumstances which afforded him\r\nground for being positive was, as he testified on cross-examination,\r\nthat he was from home at a camp-meeting (when she run away); \"our\r\ncamp-meetings,\" said the witness, \"are held in the last of August or the\r\nfirst of September; the year I fix by founding it upon knowledge; the\r\nyear before she ran away, I professed religion; I have something at home\r\nto fix the year; she was with me a part of a year. I hired her for the\r\nyear 1848 as a house servant; I hired her directly from Dr. George W.\r\nPurnell. When she ran away I proceeded after her. I advertised, in\r\nDelaware in written advertisements, in Georgetown, Milford and\r\nMillsborough, and described her and the boy; her general features. I\r\nhave not the advertisement and can't tell how she was described; Dr.\r\nGeorge Purnell united with me in the advertisement. I followed her to\r\nDelaware City; that's all I have done since, about inquiring after them.\r\nI came, after twenty-two years' absence, to seek my own rights, and as\r\nan evidence for my friend. I have not seen her more than once since she\r\nran away, until she was arrested; I saw her two or three times in court.\r\nI saw her first in a wretched-looking room, at Fifth and Germantown\r\nRoad; it was yesterday morning; it was the evening before at Congress\r\nHall; I arrived here last Tuesday a week; a man told me where she\r\nwas\"--\"I beg the court,\"--here Mr. McMurtrie interposed an objection to\r\nhis mentioning the person. The court, however, said the question could\r\nbe put.\r\n\r\n_Witness_.--I was pledged not to tell the name; the person signed her\r\nname Louisa Truit; the information was got by letter; the reason I did\r\nnot tell, because I thought she might be murdered; I have not the\r\nletters, and can't tell the contents; the letter that I received\r\nrequired a pledge that I would not tell: I was directed to send my\r\nletter to the post-office without any definite place; the representative\r\nof Louisa Truit was a man; I saw him in Market street between Third and\r\nFourth, at Taylor and Paulding's store, in the course of last week; I\r\nwas brought into contact with the representative of Louisa by\r\nappointment in the letter, to get the information; I never heard him\r\ntell his name; he was neither colored nor white; we call them with us\r\nmixed blood; (I should take you to be colored, said the witness to Mr.\r\nBrown.) I suppose he lives somewhere up there; I saw him at my room the\r\nnext morning; I did not learn from him who wrote the letter; he did not\r\ndescribe the person of the woman in the letter written to me, only her\r\ngeneral appearance; Purnell said he burnt the letter.\r\n\r\nMr. Brown demanded the letter, or the proof of its destruction.\r\n\r\nI never wrote myself, but my friend, Mr. Henry did; he said so; I never\r\nreceived a letter; it was written to Robert J. Henry; part of the letter\r\nwas written to me, but not directed to me; the Louisa Truit, who wrote,\r\nstated, that for the information he wanted $100 for one of the\r\nfugitives; he was referred to the store of Taylor & Paulding, and Mr.\r\nHenry would meet him there; when I got to the store, some of the concern\r\nlet Mr. Henry know that a man wanted to see him; I heard this at the\r\nstore; the man was there; he was a mulatto man, middle-aged, and\r\nmiddling tall; he is not here, that I know of; can't tell when I last\r\nsaw him. His name I understood to be Gloucester.\r\n\r\nUnder the severe cross-examination that the witness had been subjected\r\nto under D.P. Brown, he became very faint, and called for water. Large\r\ndrops of sweat stood upon his forehead, and he was obliged to sit down,\r\nlest he should fall down. \"Take a seat,\" said Mr. Brown tauntingly, \"and\r\nenjoy yourself, while I proceed with my interrogations.\" But the witness\r\nwas completely used up, and was allowed to withdraw to another room,\r\nwhere fresh air was more plentiful. The cause of the poor slave woman\r\nwas greatly strengthened by this failure.\r\n\r\nAnother witness, named Zachariah Bowen, for the claimants, swore\r\npositively that he knew the prisoner well, that she had been hired to\r\nhis brother for three years by Dr. Purnell, whose slave she was; also he\r\nswore that he knew her parents, who were slaves to the said Doctor P.;\r\nthat he last saw her in 1827, etc. On cross-examination he swore thus:\r\n\"I last saw her in 1827, she was about sixteen or seventeen; she was\r\nabout an ordinary size, not the smallest size, nor the largest; she was\r\nneither thick nor thin; there was nothing remarkable in her more than is\r\ncommon; nothing in her speech; she was about the same color as the woman\r\nhere; I never saw a great deal of change in a nigger, from sixteen to\r\nthirty-five or forty, sometimes they grow fatter, and sometimes leaner.\r\nAs to recognizing her in Philadelphia, he had not the slightest\r\ndifficulty. He went on to swear, that he first saw her in a cab, in the\r\ncity; I knew her yesterday; if you could see the rest of the family you\r\ncould pick her out yourself in thirty: I knew her by her general favor,\r\nand have no particular mark; I would not attempt to describe features;\r\nher favor is familiar to me; I never saw any marks upon her.\"\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Brown said he would not examine this witness further until he\r\nhad concluded the examination of the witness, who had become sick. The\r\ncourt then adjourned till nine o'clock the next morning.\r\n\r\nThe avenues to the court were filled with anxious persons, and in the\r\nfront and rear of the state house the crowd was very great.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, at an early hour, the court-room, and all the avenues\r\nto it were densely crowded by people interested in behalf of the woman\r\nwhose case was under trial. A large number of respectable ladies formed\r\na part of the large gathering.\r\n\r\nRobert F. Bowen, the witness, who became sick, was recalled.\r\n\r\n_Witness_.--\"I saw the colored person, who gave the information, the\r\nnext evening; after I saw him in Market street, at Congress Hall, in our\r\nroom; the gentleman who keeps the hotel we did not wish to place under\r\nany responsibility, as he might be accused of carrying on the business.\r\n(Of kidnapping, suggested Mr. Brown.) No, said witness, that is what you\r\ncall it; the woman would have run away if it had gone out; I heard his\r\nname was Gloucester, that gave the information; I saw him three times;\r\nonce on the street; I have never been in his house; I have been to a\r\nhouse where I heard he lived; I gave a pledge not to disclose the\r\nmatter; I made a personal pledge to Gloucester in our room last week at\r\nCongress Hall; he said he was afraid of being abused by the population\r\nof his own color for telling that this girl run away from Dr. Purnell; I\r\nunderstood that Louisa Truit was Gloucester's wife.\"\r\n\r\nUnder this searching cross-examination, Mr. Brown constrained him not\r\nonly to tell all and more than he knew in favor of his friend, the\r\nclaimant, but wrung from him the secrets which he stood pledged never to\r\ndisclose.\r\n\r\n_Witness_.--\"I know no marks; she was in the condition of a married\r\nwoman when she left me; it was the particular favor of her father and\r\nmother that made me recognize her; nothing else; she was pretty well\r\nbuilt for her size.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this witness remembered every thing so accurately occurring in\r\nrelation to the life and escape of the girl of sixteen, and was prepared\r\nto swear to her identity simply \"by her favor,\" as he termed it, he was\r\nfound sadly deficient in memory touching the owner, whom he had known\r\nmuch longer, and more intimately than he had the girl, as will be seen\r\nfrom the following facts in this witness' testimony:\r\n\r\n_Witness_.--\"I don't know when Dr. P. died; I can't tell the year; I\r\nshould suppose about fourteen years ago; I was at the funeral, and\r\nhelped to make his coffin; it was in the fall, I think; it was after the\r\ncamp-meeting I spoke of; at that time I went regularly, but not of late;\r\nI have no certain recollection of the year he died; I kept a record of\r\nthe event of my conversion, and have referred to it often. It has been a\r\nreference every year, and perhaps a thousand times a year; it was in the\r\nBible, and I was in the habit of looking into it; I was in the habit of\r\nturning over the leaves of this precious book; I think it was eighteen\r\nyears ago; can't say I'm certain; can't say it was more than twelve\r\nyears; Dr. P. left six children; two remain in our country, and one in\r\nLouisiana, and the one, who is here, making four; I have no interest in\r\nthe fugitive; I made no contract in regard to this case; there was an\r\noffer; are you waiting for an answer? the offer was this, that I was to\r\ncome on after my fugitive, and if I did not get him they were to pay my\r\nexpenses; I hesitated about coming; it was a long time before I made up\r\nmy mind; they said they would pay my expenses if I didn't succeed in\r\ngetting mine out of prison.\"\r\n\r\nIn this way the above witness completely darkened counsel, and added to\r\nthe weakness of his cause in a marked degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OVERSEER IS NOW EXAMINED.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Zachariah Bowen_ recalled.--\"I didn't come here on any terms; I hardly\r\nunderstand what you mean by terms; I made no contract; I came upon my\r\nown book; there was no contract; I have no expectations; I don't know\r\nthat Dr. P. ever manumitted any female slaves; I never knew that she was\r\nin the family way when she ran away; I heard of it about that time; she\r\nran off in the fall of 1828. Dr. P. told me so; in the fall of 1828; in\r\n1825, '26, '27, she lived with my brother; in 1825 I lived there; in\r\n1827 and '28 I lived with Dr. P. I moved there and was overseer for him;\r\nI was overseer for fifteen years for him; two years at his house; I\r\nceased to be his overseer in 1841, I think; he was living in 1841; I am\r\ncertain of that year, I think; Dr. Purnell died in 1844, I feel certain;\r\nI said to Mr. Purnell that I did not know what ailed the other Mr.\r\nBowen, for the doctor died in 1844; he died in the latter part of the\r\nSpring of 1844; Mr. Bowen made a mistake in saying it was eighteen years\r\nago; if you recall him he will rectify the mistake, I think; several\r\nslaves escaped from Dr. Purnell; a boy, that lived with my brother, ran\r\naway in 1827; the others were not hired to my brother; I don't know that\r\nI could tell the exact time, nor the year; the doctor used to say to us,\r\nthere is another of my niggers ran away; the reason that I can tell when\r\nMahala ran away, is because she took a husband and ran away; I was\r\nmarried that year; the reason I cannot tell about the others is, because\r\nthey went at different times in five years; the first who ran away\r\nbefore Mahala, was named Grace; she went in 1827; I don't know when the\r\nlast went, or who it was.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nGloucester said they had raised a mob on him, on account of this case,\r\nand he would have to leave the city; the case of this woman or these\r\nproceedings was not spoken of there; he staid but a short time; he said\r\none of the witnesses had betrayed him in court, yesterday, and they\r\nattacked him last night; I asked him how he escaped from so many; he\r\nsaid very few were in the city who could outrun him; I asked him where\r\nhe was going, he replied he had a notion to put for Canada; some of the\r\ngentlemen proposed his going to Baltimore; he said that would not do, as\r\nthe laws of Maryland would catch him; he was going to get a boat and go\r\nto New Jersey, and then to New York; Mr. Purnell gave him just\r\nthirty-five dollars last night; he paused a while, and Mr. P. told him\r\nto hand it back; he then took out his money and put some more to it, and\r\nsaid: \"Here is fifty dollars.\" Mr. P. said that if he got the slave he\r\nwould leave fifty dollars more with a person in the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion by the judge.--\"You have spoken of a conversation in which Mr.\r\nP. told you of certain letters or correspondence, and that they had\r\nreference to this alleged fugitive. I want you to give me, to the best\r\nof your recollection, everything he said the letters contained.\"\r\n\r\n_Witness_.--Mr. P. told me when he first mentioned it to me, he said\r\nthat he was going to mention something to me, that he did not want\r\nanything said, in regard to some negroes that had run away from his\r\nfather; he said he wanted me to come on here, and he did not want me to\r\ntell any person before we left our county; that if the negroes heard of\r\nit, they could get information to the parties before he could get here;\r\nI told him I would not tell any person except my wife; he then said he\r\nhad correspondence with a person here, for a month or two, and he had no\r\ndoubt but that several of his negroes were here, from what he had heard\r\nfrom his correspondent; he asked me if I could recognize the favor of\r\nthis Mahala? I told him I didn't know; he then said if anybody would\r\nknow her, I would, as she had lived with my brother three years; he then\r\nsaid that he would want to start the next week, but he would see me\r\nagain at that time; that was all he said at that time, only we turned\r\ninto a hotel, and he said don't breathe this to anybody; on Saturday\r\nbefore we left home, he came to my house, and said: well, I shall want\r\nyou to start for Philadelphia, on Monday morning; I suppose you will go?\r\nI told him I would rather not, if he could do without out me; but as I\r\ntold him before, I would go, if he still requested it. I would go;\r\nthat's all, sir, except that I said I would be along in the stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nJ.T. Hammond was then called, a young man who admitted he had never seen\r\nthe respondent till he came to the court-house, but was ready to swear\r\nthat he would have known her by her resemblance to Dr. Purnell's set of\r\nnegroes. \"His whole set?\" said Mr. Brown. \"Yes, sir.\" (Derisive\r\nlaughter).\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. McMurtrie offered to prove, by persons who had known the two\r\nwitnesses who had testified in this case, from their youth, that they\r\nwere respectable and worthy men. D.P. Brown, said that if the gentleman\r\nfound it necessary to sustain his witnesses' reputation, in consequence\r\nof the peculiar dilemma they had got into, he would object, and if he\r\nsupposed that he was about to contradict them in some point in the\r\ndefence, he certainly was right, but as the case could not be concluded\r\nto-day, he would like to have the matter adjourned over until Tuesday\r\nnext.\r\n\r\nMr. McMurtrie objected, by saying, that his client was anxious to have\r\nthe matter disposed of as soon as possible, as he had been subjected to\r\nnumerous insults since the matter had been before the court.\r\n\r\nJudge Kane intimated that no weight was to be attached to this\r\nconsideration, as the full power of the court was at his disposal for\r\nthe purpose of protecting his client from insult.\r\n\r\nMr. McMurtrie replied that he did not know whether words spoken came\r\nwithin the meaning of the act of Congress, in such matters.\r\n\r\nThe court took a recess until a quarter to three o'clock.\r\n\r\nThe court met again at a quarter to three o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. McMurtrie asked that the witnesses for the defence be excluded from\r\nthe court room, except the one upon the stand.\r\n\r\nThis was objected to by Mr. Brown, as the witnesses for the prosecution\r\nhad not been required so to do; but he afterwards withdrew his\r\nobjections, and notified Mr. McMurtrie that he would require any\r\nwitnesses he might have in addition, should retire also; as he would\r\nobject to any of them being heard if they remained.\r\n\r\n_The Defence_.--Mr. Pierce opened the case by saying that the testimony\r\nfor the defence would be clear and conclusive; that the witnesses for\r\nthe prosecution are mistaken in the identity of the alleged fugitive.\r\nThat at the time they allege her to have been in Maryland, on the\r\nplantation of Dr. Purnell, she was in Chester county, and in the year\r\nLafayette visited this country, she was in this city. He would confine\r\nthe testimony exclusively to these two counties, and show that she is\r\nnot the alleged slave.\r\n\r\nHenry C. Cornish, sworn. I live in this city, and am a shoemaker; I came\r\nhere in the year 1830; before that I lived in Chester county, East\r\nWhiteland township, with Wm. Latta; my father lived with Mr. Latta six\r\nor eight years; I lived there three years before that time, and was\r\nfamiliar with the place for more than six years before 1830; I saw the\r\nalleged fugitive some five years before 1830, at George Amos', in\r\nUwchland township, some eight or ten miles from our house; I fix the\r\ntime from a meeting being held on the Valley Hill by a minister, named\r\nNathan D. Tierney; that must have been in 1825; I am positive it was\r\nbefore the beginning of the year 1828; I have not the least doubt; I\r\njoined church about that time; it was the first of my uniting with the\r\nchurch; it was in 1825; I joined the Methodist Episcopal Church; before\r\nthey built a church they held meetings alternately at people's houses; I\r\nmet her at Amos' house, I recollect my father going to dig the\r\nfoundation of the church: I saw her there before the church was built; I\r\nknew her before she was married; and since I left there I have met her\r\nat the annual meetings of the church; I have kept up the acquaintance\r\never since; I knew that she had two children, that were buried as long\r\nas twenty-one or twenty-two years ago; if the boy had lived he would\r\nhave been twenty-three or twenty-four years old; he was the oldest; she\r\nwas not married when I first saw her in 1827; she did not appear to be\r\nanything but a girl, and was not married, and she of course could not be\r\nin the condition of a married woman; I was not at her wedding; if I had\r\nnot continued to know her, I would not now know her; she was then a\r\nsmall person; age and flesh would change her a little; her complexion\r\nhas not changed; I think she worked for Mrs. Amos; a church record is\r\nnow kept very correct; but when I first went into the church, colored\r\nmen could not read and write; I acted as the clerk of the church; I\r\nunited with the church after I first saw her; I have seen her very often\r\nsince I left Chester; five hundred times to speak safely; I worship down\r\ntown and she up in Brown street; to the best of my recollection they\r\nmoved over Schuylkill about twelve years ago; she has lived here about\r\nnine years; she has six children, I have heard; I have seen five; the\r\noldest is eighteen or nineteen; the youngest a sucking babe; I have\r\nvisited her house since I have been here; I was not sent for by my\r\nuncle, who was employed by Joseph Smith & Co., next to the Girard Bank;\r\nI was with Edward Biddle for four years, until he was elected President\r\nof the Morris Canal and Banking Company, and then I went to learn\r\nshoemaking under instructions, since which time I have been in business\r\nfor myself; my father burnt limestone for Mr. Latta; he and his wife are\r\ndead; I was there a day or two ago for witnesses to testify in this\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n_Cross-examined._--I was born in 1814, and am thirty-seven years of age;\r\nwhen I first knew her I suppose she was fifteen years old; she was\r\nmarried about three years afterwards; her husband's name is Micajah\r\nWilliams; I heard he was in prison for stealing; her name before\r\nmarriage was Phamie Coates; I didn't know her husband before they were\r\nmarried; don't know whether they came from Maryland; I never knew of\r\nMahala Richardson before last evening in court; the difference in her\r\nappearance is a natural one, that every body is acquainted with; I mean\r\nthat a little boy is not a man, and a growing girl is not a woman; age\r\nand flesh and size make a difference; if I had not conversed with her\r\nduring the twenty-one years, I would not have known her; I never changed\r\na word with her about the case, except to say I was sorry to see her\r\nhere; I knew her the moment I saw her; her arrest could not have been in\r\nthe newspapers of the morning as she was not arrested until seven\r\no'clock that day; I went to Chester to look for witnesses; I came to the\r\ncourt because I am a vigilant man, and my principle is to save any\r\nperson whose liberty is in danger; I had heard that a woman was\r\narrested; her business is to get work wherever she can.\r\n\r\nDeborah Ann Boyer, sworn. I was thirty-three last January; I live within\r\none mile of West Chester; I am a married woman; I have lived there since\r\n1835. I went there with my mother; I can read; I have seen the alleged\r\nfugitive before this; I first knew her at Downingtown, when she came to\r\nmy mother's house; that was before I had gone to West Chester with my\r\nmother; you can tell how long it was, for it was in 1826; my brother was\r\nborn in that year; I was quite small then; don't know how she came\r\nthere; she was with my mother during her confinement; my brother is\r\ndead; it is written down in our Testament; and I took an epitaph from it\r\nto put on the tombstone; the last time I saw it was when the fellow\r\nkilled the school-mistress. I looked because about 1830, a man killed a\r\nwoman, and was hung, and I wanted to see how long ago it was. I have\r\nseen her more or less ever since, until within two years. I don't\r\nremember when she went from mother, but I saw her at Mr. Latta's\r\nafterwards. I have no doubt she is the woman; she was then a slim, tall\r\ngirl, larger than myself; she is not darker now, but heavier set every\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Gayly affirmed.--I am between forty-seven and forty-eight years of\r\nage. I live in the city at this time. I was raised in Chester county, in\r\n1824, and have been here about five years. I lived in Downingtown nine\r\nor ten years. I lived awhile in West Chester, and lived in Chester\r\ncounty until about five years ago. I know the alleged fugitive. I first\r\nsaw her in the neighborhood of Downingtown, at a place they call\r\nDowning's old stage office; she worked in the house with me; it was\r\nsomewhere near 1824, just before Lafayette came about; she worked off\r\nand on days' work, to wash dishes; she was a small girl then, very thin,\r\nand younger than me. I met with her, as near as I can tell you, down in\r\nthe valley, at a place called the Valley Inn. I used to see her off and\r\non at church, in 1826. I visited her at Mr. Latta's, after she lived at\r\nthe Valley Inn. I don't know when she left that county. I know the\r\nalleged fugitive is the same person; she belonged to the same church,\r\nEbenezer. I know the brothers Cornish, and have whipped them many a\r\ntime. I lived with Latta myself, and the Cornish, who is now a minister,\r\nlived there; he lived there before I did, and so did the alleged\r\nfugitive. I was then between twenty-three and twenty-five years old; she\r\nwas a strip of a girl; she was not in the family way when she came\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nCross-examined.--I have not seen her since 1826, until I saw her here in\r\nthe court-room; I recognized her when I first saw her here without\r\nanybody pointing her out, and she recognized me; I have reason to know\r\nher, because she has the same sort of a scar on her forehead that I\r\nhave; we used to make fun of each other about the marks; she went by the\r\nname of Fanny Coates. I know nothing about her husband; she did not do\r\nthe work of a woman in 1826; she washed dishes, scrubbed, etc. I heard\r\nher say her father and mother were dead, and that they lived somewhere\r\nin that neighborhood; she at that time made her home with a family named\r\nAmos.\r\n\r\nThe Judge asked to see the scar on the witness' forehead and that on the\r\nforehead of the respondent. They were brought near the bench, and the\r\nmarks inspected, which were plainly seen on both. During this time the\r\ninfant of the respondent was entrusted to another colored woman. The\r\nchild, who, up to this time, had been quiet, raised a piteous cry and\r\nwould not be pacified. The whole scene excited a great sensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Brown then rose in reply to the plaintiff's counsel, and said: If I\r\nconsulted my own views, I should not say one syllable, in answer to the\r\narguments of the learned counsel upon the other side, and relying as I\r\ndo upon the evidence, and out of respect to the convenience of your\r\nhonor, I shall say very little as it is. The views of the counsel it\r\nappears to me, are most extraordinary indeed. He seems to take it for\r\ngranted that everything that is said on the part of the witnesses for\r\nthe claimant is gospel, and that what is said on the part of the\r\nwitnesses for the respondent, is to be considered matter of suspicion.\r\nNow I rate no man by his size, color, or position, but I appeal to you\r\nin looking at the testimony that has been produced here, on the\r\ndifferent sides of the question, and judging it by its intrinsic worth,\r\nwhether there is the slightest possible comparison between the witnesses\r\non the part of the plaintiff, and those of the defendant, either in\r\nintelligence, memory, language, thought, or anything else. This is a\r\nfine commentary upon the disparagement of color! Looking at the men as\r\nthey are, as you will, I say that the testimony exhibited on the part of\r\nthe respondent would outweigh a whole theatre of such men as are\r\nexhibited on the part of the complainant. I say nothing here about their\r\nrespectability. It would have been proper for the learned counsel on the\r\npart of the plaintiff, if he thought the witnesses on the part of the\r\nrespondent unworthy of belief, to have proved them so; but instead of\r\nthat, he attempts to bolster up men, who, whether respectable or\r\notherwise, from their inconsistency, involutions and tergiversations in\r\nregard to this case, produce no possible effect upon the judicial mind,\r\nbut that which is unfavorable to themselves. Impartial men, are they?\r\nHow do they appear before you? They appear under cover from first to\r\nlast; standing upon their right to resist inquiries legitimately\r\npropounded to them; burning up letters since they have arrived,\r\ncalculated to shed light upon this subject; and before they come here,\r\ncorresponding with and deriving information from a man, an evident\r\nkidnapper, who dare not sign his name and gets his wife to sign hers.\r\nThis is the character these men exhibit here before you; clandestinely\r\nmeeting together at the tavern, and that to consult in regard to the\r\nidentity of a person about whom they know nothing. Can they refer to any\r\nmarks by which to identify this person? Nothing at all of the kind. Do\r\nthey, with the exception of the first witness examined, state even the\r\ntime when she left? Have they produced the letter written by this\r\nkidnapper, showing how he described her? Why, let me ask, is not the\r\nfull light allowed to shine on this case? But even with the light they\r\nhave shed upon it, I would have been perfectly content to have rested\r\nit, relying upon their testimony alone, for a just decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, what man among them, professes to have seen this woman for\r\ntwenty-one years? Not one. The learned gentleman attempts to sustain his\r\ncase, because one of our witnesses, certainly not more than one, has not\r\nseen this woman for about the same length of time: but don't you\r\nperceive, that in this case they all lived in the same State, if not in\r\nthe same county--they had intercourse with persons mutually acquainted\r\nwith her, and three out of four of them, met her for several months at\r\nthe same church; and one witness, who had long been in her society, and\r\nin close association with her, knew she had a mark upon her forehead\r\ncorresponding to the one she bore on her own. And by dint of all these\r\nmatters, this long continued acquaintance only reviving the impressions\r\nreceived in early life, they had no doubt of the identity of the person.\r\nWas there ever a more perfect train of evidence exhibited to prove the\r\nidentity of a person, than on the present occasion?\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have called witnesses on this point alone, and have more than\r\ncounterpoised the evidence produced upon the opposite side. And we have\r\nnot only made it manifest that she was a free woman, but we have\r\nconfirmed her charter by separate proof. What does the gentleman say\r\nfurther? Do I understand him to say we have no right to determine this\r\nmatter judicially? Now what is all this about? Why is it before you,\r\ntaking your time day after day? According to this argument, you have\r\nnothing to do but to give the master the flesh he claims. But you are to\r\nbe satisfied that you have sufficient reason to believe that these\r\nclaims are well founded. And if you leave that matter in a state of\r\ndoubt, it does not require a single witness to be called on the part of\r\nthe respondent, to prove on the opposite side of the question. But we\r\nhave come in with a weight of evidence demolishing the structure he has\r\nraised, restoring the woman to her original position in the estimation\r\nof the law. \"Well,\" says the gentleman, \"it is like the case of a\r\nfugitive from justice.\" But it is not, and if it were, it would not\r\nbenefit his case. The case of a fugitive from justice is one in which\r\nthe prisoner is remanded to the custody of the law, handed over for\r\nlegal purposes. The case of a fugitive from labor is a case in which the\r\nindividual is handed over sometimes to a merciless master, and very\r\nrarely to a charitable one. Does the counsel mean to say that in the\r\ncase of a fugitive from justice he is not bound to satisfy the judge\r\nbefore whom, the question is heard? He should prove our witnesses\r\nunworthy of belief. As Judge Grier said, upon a former occasion, \"You\r\ncan choose your own time; you have full and abundant opportunities on\r\nevery side to prepare against any contingency.\" Why don't they do so? He\r\nis not to come here and force on a case, and say, I suppose you take\r\nevery thing for granted. He is to come prepared to prove the justice of\r\nhis claim before the tribunal who is to decide upon it. That he has not\r\ndone successfully, and I would, therefore, ask your Honor, after the\r\nelaborate argument on the part of the plaintiff, to discharge this\r\nwoman: for after such an abundance of testimony unbroken and\r\nincontestable as that we have exhibited here, it would be a monstrous\r\nperversion of reason to suppose that anything more could be required.\r\n\r\nMr. McMurtrie replied by reasserting his positions. It was a grave\r\nquestion for the court to consider what evidence was required. He\r\nthought that this decision might be the turning case to show whether the\r\nact of Congress would be carried out or whether we were to return in\r\nfact to the state of affairs under the old laws.\r\n\r\nJudge Kane said, in reference to the remarks at the close of Mr.\r\nMcMurtrie's speech: So long as I retain my seat on this bench, I shall\r\nendeavor to enforce this law without reference to my own sympathies, or\r\nthe sympathies and opinions of others. I do not think, in the cases\r\nunder this act of Congress, or a treaty, or constitutional, or legal\r\nprovision for the extradition of fugitives from justice, that it is\r\npossible to imagine that conclusive proof of identity could be\r\nestablished by depositions. From the nature of the case and the facts to\r\nbe proved, proof cannot be made in anticipation of the identity of the\r\nparty. That being established, it is the office of the judge, to\r\ndetermine whether a _prima facie_ case indicates the identity of the\r\nparty charged, with the party before him.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the evidence of the claimant has been met, and\r\nregarding the bearing of the witnesses for the respondent, met by\r\nwitnesses who testified, with apparent candor and great intelligence. If\r\nthey are believed, then the witnesses for the claimant are mistaken. The\r\nquestion is, whether two witnesses for the claimant, who have not seen\r\nthe respondent for twenty-three, one for twenty-four years, are to be\r\nbelieved in preference to four witnesses on the other side, three of\r\nwhom have seen her frequently since 1826, and known her as Euphemia\r\nWilliams, and the fourth, who has not seen her for a quarter of a\r\ncentury, but testifies that when they were children, they used to jest\r\neach other about scars, which they still bear upon their persons; I am\r\nbound to say that the proof by the four witnesses has not been\r\noverthrown by the contrary evidence of the two who only recognized her\r\nwhen they called on her with the marshall. One says he called her Mahala\r\nPurnell as soon as he saw her. He might be mistaken. He inferred he\r\nwould find her at the place to which he went. There were three persons\r\nin the room, one was Mahala Richardson, whom he knew, a young girl, and\r\nthe prisoner. If she had been alone, his recognition would have been of\r\nno avail. The fact is obvious to this court, that the respondent has no\r\npeculiar physiognomy or gait. It has been shown she has no peculiarity\r\nof voice; I cannot but feel that the fact alleged by the claimant is\r\nvery doubtful, when the witnesses, without mark or peculiarity, testify\r\nthat they can readily recognize the girl of fifteen in the woman of\r\nforty. The prisoner is therefore discharged.\r\n\r\nA slight attempt at applause in the court room was promptly suppressed.\r\nThe intelligence of the discharge of the woman, was quickly spread to\r\nthose without, who raised shouts of joy. The woman, with her children,\r\nwere hurried into a carriage, which was driven first to the Anti-slavery\r\noffice and then to the Philadelphia Institute, in Lombard Street above\r\nSeventh. Here she was introduced to a large audience of colored people,\r\nwho hailed her appearance with lively joy; several excited speeches were\r\nmade, and great enthusiasm was manifested in and outside of the building\r\nand the adjacent streets. When Euphemia came out, the horses were taken\r\nout of the carriage, and a long rope was attached, which was taken by as\r\nmany colored people as could get hold of it, and the woman and her\r\nchildren thus conveyed to her home.\r\n\r\nThe procession was accompanied by several hundreds of men, women and\r\nboys. They dragged the carriage past the residence of the counsel for\r\nthe respondent, cheering them by huzzas of the wildest kind, and then\r\ntook the vehicle and its contents to the residence of the woman,\r\nGermantown Road near Fifth street, beguiling the way with songs and\r\nshouts. The whole scene was one of wild, ungovernable excitement,\r\nproduced by exuberance of joy.\r\n\r\nThe masterly management of abolitionists in connection with the counsel,\r\nsaved poor Euphemia from being dragged from her children into hopeless\r\nbondage. While the victory was a source of great momentary rejoicing on\r\nthe part of the friends of the slave it was nevertheless quite manifest\r\nthat she was only released by the \"skin of her teeth.\" \"A scar on her\r\nforehead\" saved her. Relative to this important mark, a few of\r\nEuphemia's friends enjoyed a very pleasing anecdote, which, at the time,\r\nthey were obliged to withhold from the public; it is too good to be kept\r\nany longer. For a time, Euphemia was kept in durance vile, up in the\r\ndome of Independence Hall, partly in the custody of Lieutenant Gouldy of\r\nthe Mayor's police, (who was the right man in the right place), whose\r\nsympathies were secretly on the side of the slave. While his pitying\r\neyes gazed on Euphemia's sad face, he observed a very large scar on her\r\nforehead, and was immediately struck with the idea that that old scar\r\nmight be used with damaging effect by the witnesses and counsel against\r\nher. At once he decided that the scar must be concealed, at least, until\r\nafter the examination of the claimant's witnesses. Accordingly a large\r\nturban was procured and placed on Euphemia's head in such a manner as to\r\nhide the scar completely, without exciting the least suspicion in the\r\nminds of any. So when the witnesses against her swore that she had no\r\nparticular mark, David Paul Brown made them clinch this part of their\r\ntestimony irrevocably. Now, when Sarah Gayly affirmed (on the part of\r\nthe prisoner) that \"I have reason to know her because she has the same\r\nsort of a scar on her forehead that I have, we used to make fun of each\r\nother about the marks,\" etc., if it was not evident to all, it was to\r\nsome, that she had \"stolen their thunder,\" as the \"chop-fallen\"\r\ncountenances of the slave-holder's witnesses indicated in a moment.\r\nDespair was depicted on all faces sympathizing with the pursuers.\r\n\r\nWith heavy pecuniary losses, sad damage of character, and comfortless,\r\nthe unhappy claimant and his witnesses were compelled to return to\r\nMaryland, wiser if not better men. The account of this interesting\r\ntrial, we have condensed from a very careful and elaborate report of it\r\npublished in the \"Pennsylvania Freeman,\" January 13th, 1857.\r\n\r\nApparently, the vigilance of slave-hunters was not slackened by this\r\ndefeat, as the records show that many exciting cases took place in\r\nPhiladelphia and Pennsylvania, and if the records of the old\r\nAbolitionist Society could be published, as they should be, it would\r\nappear that many hard-fought battles have taken place between Freedom\r\nand Slavery on this soil.\r\n\r\nHere in conclusion touching the Fugitive Slave Law, arrests under it,\r\netc., as a fitting sequel we copy two extracts from high authority. The\r\nfirst is from the able and graphic pen of James Miller McKim, who was\r\nwell known to stand in the front ranks of both the Anti-slavery Society\r\nand the Underground Rail Road cause through all the long and trying\r\ncontest, during which the country was agitated by the question of\r\nimmediate emancipation, and shared the full confidence and respect of\r\nAbolitionists of all classes throughout the United States and Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nThe letter from which we have made this extract was written to Hon.\r\nGeorge Thompson, the distinguished abolitionist of England, and speaks\r\nfor itself. The other quotation is from the pen of a highly respectable\r\nand intelligent lady, belonging to the Society of Friends, or Quakers,\r\nand a most devoted friend of the slave, whose statement obviously is\r\nliterally true.\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. McKiM to GEORGE THOMPSON, 1851.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The accompanying parcel of extracts will give you a full account\r\n    of the different slave cases tried in this city, under the new\r\n    Fugitive Slave Law up to this time. Full and accurate as these\r\n    reports are, they will afford you but a faint idea of the\r\n    anguish and confusion that have been produced in this part of\r\n    the country by this infamous statute. It has turned Southeastern\r\n    Pennsylvania into another Guinea Coast, and caused a large\r\n    portion of the inhabitants to feel as insecure from the brutal\r\n    violence and diabolical acts of the kidnapper, as are the\r\n    unhappy creatures who people the shores of Africa. Ruffians from\r\n    the other side of the Slave-line, aided by professional\r\n    kidnappers on our own soil, a class of men whose 'occupation'\r\n    until lately, had been 'gone,' are continually prowling through\r\n    the community, and every now and then seizing and carrying away\r\n    their prey. As a specimen of the boldness, though fortunately,\r\n    not of the success always with which these wretches prosecute\r\n    their nefarious trade, read the enclosed article, which I cut\r\n    from the _Freeman_, of January 2d, and bear in mind that in no\r\n    respect are the facts here mentioned over-stated.\r\n\r\n    This affair occurred in Chester county, one of the most orderly\r\n    and intelligent counties in the State, a county settled\r\n    principally by Quakers. A week or two after this occurrence, and\r\n    not far from the same place, a farmhouse was entered by a band\r\n    of armed ruffians, in the evening, and at a time when all the\r\n    able-bodied occupants, save one, were known to be absent. This\r\n    was a colored man, who was seated by the kitchen fire, and in\r\n    the act of taking off his shoes. He was instantly knocked down\r\n    and gagged; but, still resisting, he was beaten most\r\n    unmercifully. There was a woman, and also a feeble old man, in\r\n    the house, who were attracted to the spot by the scuffle; but\r\n    they could neither render any assistance, nor (the light being\r\n    put out), could they recognize the parties engaged in it. The\r\n    unhappy victim being fairly overcome, was dragged like a slain\r\n    beast to a wagon, which was about a hundred yards distant,\r\n    waiting to receive him. In this he was placed, and conveyed\r\n    across the line, which was about twenty miles further south; and\r\n    that was the last, so far as I know, that has ever been heard of\r\n    him. The alarm was given, of course, as soon as possible, and\r\n    the neighbors were quickly in pursuit; but the kidnappers had\r\n    got the start of them. The next morning the trail between the\r\n    house, and the place where the wagon stood, was distinctly\r\n    visible, and deeply marked with blood.\r\n\r\n    About a fortnight since, a letter was brought to our office,\r\n    from a well-known friend, the contents of which were in\r\n    substance as follows: A case of kidnapping had occurred in the\r\n    vicinity of West Cain Township, Chester county, at about half\r\n    past one on Sunday morning, the 16th March. A black man, by the\r\n    name of Thomas Hall, an honest, sober, and industrious\r\n    individual, living in the midst of a settlement of farmers, had\r\n    been stolen by persons who knocked at his door, and told him\r\n    that his nearest neighbor wanted him to come to his house, one\r\n    of his children being sick. Hall, not immediately opening his\r\n    door, it was burst in, and three men rushed into his house; Hall\r\n    was felled by the bludgeons of the men. His wife received\r\n    several severe blows, and on making for the door was told, that\r\n    if she attempted to go out or halloo, she would have her brains\r\n    blown out. She, however, escaped through a back window, and gave\r\n    the alarm; but before any person arrived upon the ground, they\r\n    had fled with their victim. He was taken without any clothing,\r\n    except his night clothes. A six-barrelled revolver, heavily\r\n    loaded, was dropped in the scuffle, and left; also a silk\r\n    handkerchief, and some old advertisement of a bear bait, that\r\n    was to take place in Emmittsburg, Maryland. In how many cases\r\n    the persons stolen are legally liable to capture, it is\r\n    impossible to state. The law, you know, authorizes arrests to be\r\n    made, with or without process, and nothing is easier under such\r\n    circumstances than to kidnap persons who are free born.\r\n\r\n    The very same day that I received the above mentioned letter,\r\n    and while our hearts were still aching over its contents,\r\n    another was brought us from Thomas Garrett, of Wilmington,\r\n    Delaware, announcing the abduction, a night or two before, of a\r\n    free colored man of that city. The outrage was committed by an\r\n    ex-policeman, who, pretending to be acting under the commission\r\n    which he had been known to hold, entered, near the hour of\r\n    midnight, the house of the victim, and alleging against him some\r\n    petty act of disorder, seized him, handcuffed him in the\r\n    presence of his dismayed family, and carried him off to\r\n    Maryland. The cheat that had been practised was not discovered\r\n    by the family until next evening; but it was too late, the man\r\n    was gone.\r\n\r\n    At the time Mr. Garrett's letter was handed to me, narrating the\r\n    foregoing case of man stealing, I was listening to the sad tales\r\n    of two colored women, who had come to the office for advice and\r\n    assistance. One of them was an elderly person, whose son had\r\n    been pursued by the marshal's deputies, and who had just escaped\r\n    with 'the skin of his teeth.' She did not come on her own\r\n    account, however; her heart was too full of joy for that. She\r\n    came to accompany the young woman who was with her. This young\r\n    woman was a remarkably intelligent, lady-like person, and her\r\n    story made a strong appeal to my feelings. She is a resident of\r\n    Washington, and her errand here was, to procure the liberation\r\n    of a sister-in-law, who is confined in that city, under very\r\n    peculiar circumstances. The sister-in-law had absconded from her\r\n    mistress about nine months since, and was secreted in the room\r\n    of an acquaintance, who was cook in a distinguished\r\n    slave-holding family in Washington; her intention being, there\r\n    to wait until all search should be over, and an opportunity\r\n    offer of escape to the North. But, as yet, no such opportunity\r\n    had presented itself; at least none that was available, and for\r\n    nine long months had that poor girl been confined in the narrow\r\n    limits of the cook's chamber, watched over day and night by that\r\n    faithful friend with a vigilance as sleepless as it was\r\n    disinterested. The time had now come, however, when something\r\n    must be done. The family in whose house she is hid is about to\r\n    be broken up, and the house to be vacated, and the girl must\r\n    either be rescued from her peril, or she, and all her\r\n    accomplices must be exposed. What to do under these\r\n    circumstances was the question which brought this woman to\r\n    Philadelphia. I advised her to the best of my ability, and sent\r\n    her away hopeful, if not rejoicing.\r\n\r\n    But in many of these cases we can render no aid whatever. All we\r\n    can do is to commend them to the God of the oppressed, and labor\r\n    on for the day of general deliverance. But, oh! the horrors of\r\n    this hell-born system, and the havoc made by this; its last foul\r\n    offspring, the Fugitive Slave law. The anguish, the terror, the\r\n    agony inflicted by this infamous statute, must be witnessed to\r\n    be fully appreciated. You must hear the tale of the\r\n    broken-hearted mother, who has just received tidings that her\r\n    son is in the hands of man-thieves. You must listen to the\r\n    impassioned appeal of the wife, whose husband's retreat has been\r\n    discovered, and whose footsteps are dogged by the blood-hounds\r\n    of Slavery. You must hear the husband, as I did, a few weeks\r\n    ago, himself bound and helpless, beg you for God's sake to save\r\n    his wife. You must see such a woman as Hannah Dellam, with her\r\n    noble-looking boy at her side, pleading in vain before a\r\n    pro-slavery judge, that she is of right free; that her son is\r\n    entitled to his freedom; and above all, that her babe, about to\r\n    be born, should be permitted to open its eyes upon the light of\r\n    liberty. You must hear the judge's decision, remorselessly\r\n    giving up the woman with her children born and unborn, into the\r\n    hands of their claimants--by them to be carried to the slave\r\n    prison, and thence to be sold to a returnless distance from the\r\n    remaining but scattered fragments of her once happy family.\r\n    These things you must see and hear for yourself before you can\r\n    form any adequate idea of the bitterness of this cup which the\r\n    unhappy children of oppression along this southern border are\r\n    called upon to drink. Manifestations like these have we been\r\n    obliged either to witness ourselves, or hear the recital of from\r\n    others, almost daily, for weeks together. Our aching hearts of\r\n    late, have known but little respite. A shadow has been cast over\r\n    our home circles, and a check been given to the wonted\r\n    cheerfulness of our families. One night, the night that the\r\n    woman and the boy and the unborn babe received their doom, my\r\n    wife, long after midnight, literally wept herself to sleep. For\r\n    the last fortnight we have had no new cases; but even now, when\r\n    I go home in the evening, if I happen to look more serious than\r\n    usual, my wife notices it, and asks: \"Is there another slave\r\n    case?\" and my little girls look up anxiously for my reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Miss MARY B. THOMAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaring outrage! burglary and kidnapping! The following letter tells its\r\nown startling and most painful story. Every manly and generous heart\r\nmust burn with indignation at the villainy it describes, and bleed with\r\nsympathy for the almost broken-hearted sufferers.\r\n\r\n\r\n    DOWNINGTOWN, 19th, 4th mo., 1848.\r\n\r\n    \"My Dear Friend:--This morning our family was aroused by the\r\n    screams of a young colored girl, who has been living with us\r\n    nearly a year past; but we were awakened only in time to see her\r\n    borne off by three white men, ruffians indeed, to a carriage at\r\n    our door, and in an instant she was on her way to the South. I\r\n    feel so much excited by the attendant circumstances of this\r\n    daring and atrocious deed, as scarcely to be able to give you a\r\n    coherent account of it, but I know that it is a duty to make it\r\n    known, and, I therefore write this immediately.\r\n\r\n    \"As soon as the house was opened in the morning, these men who\r\n    were lurking without, having a carriage in waiting in the\r\n    street, entered on their horrid errand. They encountered no one\r\n    in their entrance, except a colored boy, who was making the\r\n    fire; and who, being frightened at their approach, ran and hid\r\n    himself; taking a lighted candle from the kitchen, and carrying\r\n    it up stairs, they went directly to the chamber in which the\r\n    poor girl lay in a sound sleep. They lifted her from her bed and\r\n    carried her down stairs. In the entry of the second floor they\r\n    met one of my sisters, who, hearing an unusual noise, had sprung\r\n    from her bed. Her screams, and those of the poor girl, who was\r\n    now thoroughly awakened to the dreadful truth, aroused my\r\n    father, who hurried undressed from his chamber, on the ground\r\n    floor. My father's efforts were powerless against the three;\r\n    they threw him off, and with frightful imprecations hurried the\r\n    girl to the carriage. Quickly as possible my father started in\r\n    pursuit, and reached West Chester only to learn that the\r\n    carriage had driven through the borough at full speed, about\r\n    half an hour before. They had two horses to their vehicle, and\r\n    there were three men besides those in the house. These\r\n    particulars we gather from the colored boy Ned, who, from his\r\n    hiding-place, was watching them in the road.\r\n\r\n    \"Can anything be done for the rescue of this girl from the\r\n    kidnappers? We are surprised and alarmed! This deliberate\r\n    invasion of our house, is a thing unimagined. There must be some\r\n    informer, who is acquainted with our house and its arrangements,\r\n    or they never would have come so boldly through. Truly, there is\r\n    no need to preach about Slavery in the abstract, this individual\r\n    case combines every wickedness by which human nature can be\r\n    degraded.\r\n\r\n    Truly, thy friend,\r\n\r\n    MARY B. THOMAS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent letter, our friend says: \"As to detail, the whole\r\ntransaction was like a flash to those who saw the miserable ending. I\r\nwas impelled to write without delay, by the thought that it would be in\r\ntime for the 'Freeman,' and that any procrastination on my part, might\r\njeopard others of these suffering people, who are living, as was this\r\npoor girl, in fancied security. Our consternation was inexpressible; our\r\nsorrow and indignation deepen daily, as the thought returns of the awful\r\nannouncement with which we were awakened: they have carried Martha to\r\nthe South. To do what will be of most service to the cause--not their\r\ncause--ours--that of our race, is our burning desire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHELPERS AND SYMPATHIZERS AT HOME AND ABROAD--INTERESTING LETTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe necessities of the Committee for the relief of the destitute and\r\nway-worn travelers bound freedom-ward, were met mainly by friends of the\r\ncause in Philadelphia. Generous-hearted abolitionists nobly gave their\r\ngold in this work. They gave not only material, but likewise\r\nwhole-souled aid and sympathy in times of need, to a degree well worthy\r\nof commemoration while the name of slave is remembered. The Shipleys,\r\nHoppers, Parrishes, Motts, Whites, Copes, Wistars, Pennocks, Sellers,\r\nDavis, Prices, Hallowells, Sharpless, Williams, Coates, Morris, Browns,\r\nTownsends, Taylors, Jones, Grews, Wises, Lindseys, Barkers, Earles,\r\nPughs, Rogers, Whartons, Barnes, Willsons, Wrights, Peirces, Justices,\r\nSmiths, Cavenders, Stackhouses, Nealls, Dawsons, Evans, Lees, Childs,\r\nClothiers, Harveys, Laings, Middletons, etc., are among the names\r\nwell-known in the days which tried men's souls, as being most true to\r\nthe bondman, whether on the Underground Rail Road, before a Fugitive\r\nSlave-Law Court, or on a rice or cotton plantation in the South. Nor\r\nwould we pass over the indefatigable labors of the Ladies' Anti-slavery\r\nSocieties and Sewing Circles of Philadelphia, whose surpassing fidelity\r\nto the slave in the face of prejudice, calumny and reproach, year in and\r\nyear out, should be held in lasting remembrance. In the hours of\r\ndarkness they cheered the cause. While we thus honor the home-guards and\r\ncoadjutors in our immediate neighborhood, we cannot forget other earnest\r\nand faithful friends of the slave, in distant parts of the country and\r\nthe world, who volunteered timely aid and sympathy to the Vigilance\r\nCommittee of Philadelphia. Not to mention any of this class would be to\r\nfail to bestow honor where honor is due. We have only to allow the\r\nfriends to whom we allude, to speak for themselves through their\r\ncorrespondence when their hearts were stirred in the interest of the\r\nescaping slave, and they were practically doing unto others as they\r\nwould have others do unto them.\r\n\r\nHere, truly, is pure philanthropy, that vital Christianity, that True\r\nand Undefiled Religion before God and the Father, which is to visit the\r\nfatherless and widow in their affliction, and to undo the heavy burden,\r\nand let the oppressed go free. The posterity of the oppressed at least,\r\nwill need such evidences of tender regard and love as here evinced. In\r\nthose days, such expressions of Christian benevolence were cheering in\r\nthe extreme. From his able contribution to Anti-slavery papers, and his\r\nfearless and eloquent advocacy of the cause of the down-trodden slave in\r\nthe pulpit, on the platform, and in the social circle, the name of Rev.\r\nN.R. Johnston, Reformed Presbyterian (of the old Covenanter faith), will\r\nbe familiar to many. But we think it safe to say that his fidelity and\r\ndevotion to the slave are nowhere more fully portrayed than in the\r\nappended Underground Rail Road letters.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TOPSHAM, VT., September 1st, 1855.\r\n\r\n    WM. STILL, MY DEAR FRIEND:--I have the heart, but not the time,\r\n    to write you a long letter. It is Saturday evening, and I am\r\n    preparing to preach to-morrow afternoon from Heb. xiii. 3,\r\n    \"Remember them that are in bonds as bound with them.\" This will\r\n    be my second sermon from this text. Sabbath before last I\r\n    preached from it, arguing and illustrating the proposition,\r\n    deduced from it, that \"the great work to which we are now called\r\n    is the abolition of Slavery, or the emancipation of the slave,\"\r\n    showing our duty as _philanthropists_. To-morrow I intend to\r\n    point out our duty as _citizens_. Some to whom I minister, I\r\n    know, will call it a political speech; but I have long since\r\n    determined to speak for the dumb what is in my heart and in my\r\n    Bible, let men hear or forbear. I am accountable to the God of\r\n    the oppressed, not to man. If I have his favor, why need I\r\n    regard man's disfavor. Many besides the members of my own church\r\n    come out regularly to hear me. Some of them are pro-slavery\r\n    politicians. The consequence is, I preach much on the subject of\r\n    Slavery. And while I have a tongue to speak, and lips to pray,\r\n    they shall never be sealed or silent so long as millions of dumb\r\n    have so few to speak for them.\r\n\r\n    But poor Passmore Williamson is in bonds. Let us also remember\r\n    him, as bound with him. He has many sympathizers. I am glad you\r\n    did not share the same fate. For some reasons I am sorry you\r\n    have fallen into the hands of thieves. For some others I am\r\n    glad. It will make you more devoted to your good work.\r\n    Persecution always brightens the Christian, and gives more zeal\r\n    to the true philanthropist. I hope you will come off victorious.\r\n    I pray for you and your co-laborers and co-sufferers.\r\n\r\n    My good brother, I am greatly indebted to you for your continued\r\n    kindness. The Lord reward you.\r\n\r\n    I have a scholarship in an Ohio College, Geneva Hall, which will\r\n    entitle me--any one I may send--to six years tuition. It is an\r\n    Anti-slavery institution, and wholly under Anti-slavery control\r\n    and influence. They want colored students to prepare them for\r\n    the great field of labor open to men of talent and piety of that\r\n    class. When I last saw you I purposed talking to you about this\r\n    matter, but was disappointed very much in not getting to take\r\n    tea with you, as I partly promised. Have you a son ready for\r\n    college? or for the grammar school? Do you know any promising\r\n    young man who would accept my scholarship? Or would your\r\n    brother's son, Peter or Levin, like to have the benefit of it?\r\n    If so, you are at liberty to promise it to any one whom you\r\n    think I would be willing to educate. Write me at your earliest\r\n    convenience, about this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n    I presume the Standard will contain full accounts of the\r\n    Norristown meeting, the Williamson case, and your own and those\r\n    connected. If it does not, I will thank you to write me fully.\r\n\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n    What causes the delay of that book, the History of Peter Still's\r\n    Family, etc.? I long to see it.\r\n\r\n    The Lord bless you in your labors for the slave.\r\n\r\n    Yours, etc.,\r\n\r\n    N.R. JOHNSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    TOPSHAM, VT., December 26th, 1855.\r\n\r\n    WM. STILL, MY DEAR FRIEND:--I wrote to you some two or three\r\n    weeks ago, enclosing the letter to the care of a friend in\r\n    Philadelphia, whom I wished to introduce to you. I have had no\r\n    answer to that letter, and I am afraid you have not received it,\r\n    or that you have written me, and I have not received yours. In\r\n    that letter I wished to receive information respecting the best\r\n    way to expend money for the aid of fugitives. Lest you may not\r\n    have received it, I write you again, though briefly.\r\n\r\n    A few of the Anti-slavery friends, mostly ladies, in our village\r\n    have formed an Anti-slavery Society and sewing circle, the\r\n    proceeds of which are to go to aid needy or destitute fugitive\r\n    slaves. They have appointed me corresponding secretary. In\r\n    obedience to my instructions, and that I may fulfill my\r\n    promises, I want to find out from you the desired information.\r\n    We want to give the little money raised, in such a way that\r\n    fugitives who are really needy will be benefited by it. Write me\r\n    as soon as possible, where and to whom we should send the funds\r\n    when raised. I have thought that you of the Vigilance Committee,\r\n    in Philadelphia had need of it. Or, if not, you can tell us\r\n    where money is needed. Probably you know of some one in Canada\r\n    who acts for the needy there. So many impositions have been\r\n    palmed off upon charitable abolitionists, I am afraid to act in\r\n    such a case without the directions of one who knows all about\r\n    these things. Is money needed to help those escaping? If so,\r\n    should we send to New York, Philadelphia, or where else? When I\r\n    was in New York last, a young man from Richmond, Va., assuming\r\n    the name of Robert Johnston, who had come by steamboat to\r\n    Philadelphia, and whom you had directed to the Anti-slavery\r\n    office in New York, had only one dollar in money. His fare had\r\n    to be paid by a friend there, the treasurer of the fund being\r\n    absent. I know that they nearly all need money, or clothing. We\r\n    want to send our money wherever it is most needed, to help the\r\n    destitute, or those in danger, and where it will be faithfully\r\n    applied. Write me fully, giving specific directions; and I will\r\n    read your letter to the society. And as I have been waiting\r\n    anxiously, for some two weeks or more, for an answer to my\r\n    previous letter, but am disappointed unless you have written\r\n    very recently, I will be much obliged if you will write on the\r\n    reception of this. Any information you may communicate,\r\n    respecting the doing of your section of the Underground Railway\r\n    will be read before the society with much interest.\r\n\r\n    If you know the address of any one in Canada, who would be a\r\n    good correspondent respecting this matter, please give me his\r\n    name.\r\n\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n    My dear brother, go on in your good work; and the God of the\r\n    oppressed sustain and reward you, is my earnest prayer.\r\n\r\n    Yours, fraternally, in our common cause,\r\n\r\n    N.R. JOHNSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    TOPSHAM, VT., December 18th, 1856.\r\n\r\n    WM. STILL, VERY DEAR FRIEND:--I will be much pleased to hear\r\n    from you and our common cause in Pennsylvania. I am so far\r\n    removed, away here in Yankeedom, that I hear nothing from that\r\n    quarter but by the public prints. And as for the Underground\r\n    Railway, of course, I hear nothing, except now and then, I would\r\n    be greatly pleased if you would write me the state of its funds\r\n    and progress. Whatever you write will be interesting.\r\n\r\n    The Topsham Sewing Circle has begun its feeble operations again.\r\n    Owing to much opposition, a very few attend, consequently little\r\n    is made. The ladies, however, have some articles on hand unsold,\r\n    which will bring some money ere long. I wish you would write me\r\n    another long letter in detail of interesting fugitives, etc.,\r\n    such as you wrote last winter, and I will have it read before\r\n    the circle. Your letter last winter was heard by the ladies with\r\n    great interest. You are probably not aware that fugitives are\r\n    never seen here. Indeed the one half of the people have never\r\n    seen more than a half-dozen of colored people. There are none in\r\n    all this region.\r\n\r\n    I am lending Peter Still--the book--to my neighbors. It is\r\n    devoured with great interest. It does good. I think, however, if\r\n    I had been writing such a book, I would have wedged in much more\r\n    testimony against slavery and its horrid accompaniments and\r\n    consequences.\r\n\r\n    I would be glad to hear how Peter and his family are prospering.\r\n\r\n    Do you see my friends, Mr. Orr and Rev. Willson, now-a-days? Do\r\n    they help in the good cause?\r\n\r\n    If the ladies here should make up fine shirts for men, or\r\n    children's clothes of various kinds, would they be of use at\r\n    Philadelphia, or New York, to fugitives? Or would it not be\r\n    advisable to send them there? The ladies here complain that they\r\n    cannot sell what they make.\r\n\r\n    My dear brother, be not discouraged in your work, your labor of\r\n    love. The prospect before the poor slave is indeed dark, dark!\r\n    But the power shall not always be on the side of the oppressor.\r\n    God reigns. A day of vengeance will come, and that soon.\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Stowe makes Dred utter many a truth. Would that God would\r\n    write it indelibly on the heart of the nation. But the people\r\n    will not hear, and the cup of iniquity will soon fill to\r\n    overflowing; and whose ears will not be made to tingle when the\r\n    God of Sabaoth awakes to plead the cause of the dumb?\r\n\r\n    Yours, very sincerely,\r\n\r\n    N.R. JOHNSTON.\r\n\r\n    P.S. When I was in New York last Fall, October, I was in the\r\n    Anti-Slavery office one day, when a friend in the office showed\r\n    me a dispatch just received from Philadelphia, signed W.S.,\r\n    which gave notice of \"six parcels\" coming by the train, etc. And\r\n    before I left the office the \"parcels\" came in, each on two\r\n    legs. Strange parcels, that would run away on legs.\r\n\r\n    My heart leaped for joy at seeing these rescued ones. O that God\r\n    would arise and break the yoke of oppression! Let us labor on\r\n    and ever, until our work is done, until all are free.\r\n\r\n    Since the late Republican farce has closed I hope to get some\r\n    more subscribers for the Standard. Honest men's eyes will be\r\n    opened after a while, and the standard of right and expediency\r\n    be elevated. Let us \"hope on and ever.\"\r\n\r\n    Yours, for the right,\r\n\r\n    N.R.J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    TOPSHAM, VT., April 3d, 1858.\r\n\r\n    DEAR FRIEND STILL:--I entreat you not to infer from my tardiness\r\n    or neglect, that I am forgetful of my dear friend in\r\n    Philadelphia. For some time past I have done injustice to many\r\n    of my friends, in not paying my debts in epistolary\r\n    correspondence. Some of my dearest friends have cause to censure\r\n    me. But you must pardon me. I have two letters of yours on hand,\r\n    unanswered. One of them I read to the Sewing Circle; and part of\r\n    the other. For them I most heartily thank you. You are far\r\n    kinder to me than I deserve. May God reward you.\r\n\r\n    I long to see you. My head and heart is full of the cause of the\r\n    slave. I fear I give the subject too much relative importance.\r\n    Is this possible? I preach, lecture, and write for the slave\r\n    continually. And yet I don't do enough. Still I fear I neglect\r\n    the great concerns of religion at home, in my own heart, in my\r\n    congregation, and in the community.\r\n\r\n    I wish we were located near to each other. We are far separated.\r\n    I am almost isolated. You are surrounded by many friends of the\r\n    cause. Still we are laboring on the same wall, though far apart.\r\n    Are we not near in spirit?\r\n\r\n    You see by the papers that we have been trying to do something\r\n    in our Green Mountain State. The campaign has fairly begun. We\r\n    will carry the battle to the gate.\r\n\r\n    I see our friend, Miss Watkins, is still pleading for the dumb.\r\n    Noble girl! I love her for her devotedness to a good cause. Oh,\r\n    that her voice could be heard by the millions! I hope that we\r\n    can have her again in Vermont.\r\n\r\n    Give my kind regards to our mutual friend, Miller McKim. Will I\r\n    not see him and you at the anniversary in New York?\r\n\r\n    Do you ever see Rev. Willson? Is he doing anything for the\r\n    cause? I wish I could peep into your house to-night, and see if\r\n    there are any \"packages\" on hand. God bless you in your labors\r\n    of love.\r\n\r\n    Yours, truly, for the slave,\r\n\r\n    N.R. JOHNSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile it was not in the power of Mr. Johnston and his coadjutors, to\r\nrender any great amount of material aid to the Committee, as they had\r\nnot been largely blessed with this world's goods, nevertheless, the\r\nsympathy shown was as highly valued, as if they had given thousands of\r\ndollars. Not unfrequently has the image of this singularly faithful\r\nminister entered the writer's mind as he once appeared when visiting the\r\nSynod of his church in Philadelphia. Having the Underground Rail Road\r\ncause at heart, he brought with him--all the way from Vermont--his trunk\r\nwell filled with new shirts and under-clothing for the passengers on\r\nthat Road. It was characteristic of the man, and has ever since been\r\nremembered with pleasure.\r\n\r\nFrom another quarter, hundreds of miles from Philadelphia, similar\r\ntokens of interest in the cause of the fleeing bondmen were manifested\r\nby a Ladies' Anti-slavery Society, in Western New York, which we must\r\nhere record. As the proffered aid was wholly unsolicited, and as the\r\nCommittee had no previous knowledge whatever of the existence of the\r\nsociety, or any of its members, and withal, as the favors conferred,\r\ncame at times when the cause was peculiarly in need (the Committee\r\noft-times being destitute of clothing or money), the idea that the\r\nUnderground Rail Road was providentially favored, in this respect, was\r\nirresistible.\r\n\r\nWe therefore take great pleasure in commemorating the good deeds of the\r\nsociety, by copying the following letters from its president, Mrs. Dr.\r\nBrooks:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ELLINGTON, Nov. 21st, 1859.\r\n\r\n    MR. WILLIAM STILL:--Dear Sir:--In the above-named place, some\r\n    five years since there was formed a Ladies' Anti-slavery\r\n    Society, which has put forth its feeble endeavors to aid the\r\n    cause of \"breaking every yoke and letting the oppressed go\r\n    free,\" and we trust, through our means, others have been made\r\n    glad of heart. Every year we have sent a box of clothing,\r\n    bedding, etc., to the aid of the fugitive, and wishing to send\r\n    it where it would be of the most service, we have it suggested\r\n    to us, to send to you the box we have at present. You would\r\n    confer a favor upon the members of our society, by writing us,\r\n    giving a detail of that which would be the most service to you,\r\n    and whether or no it would be more advantageous to you than some\r\n    nearer station, and we will send or endeavor to, that which\r\n    would benefit you most.\r\n\r\n    William Wells Brown visited our place a short time since,\r\n    recommending us to send to you in preference to Syracuse, where\r\n    we sent our last box.\r\n\r\n    Please write, letting me know what most is needed to aid you in\r\n    your glorious work, a work which will surely meet its reward.\r\n    Direct, Ellington, Chautauqua county, N.Y.\r\n\r\n    Your sister, in the cause,\r\n\r\n    Mrs. M. BROOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    ELLINGTON, Chautauqua Co., N.Y., Dec. 7th, 1859.\r\n\r\n    MR. STILL:--Dear Sir:--Yours of the 29th, was duly and\r\n    gratefully received, although the greater portion of your\r\n    epistle, of a necessity, portrayed the darker side of the\r\n    picture, yet we have great reason to be thankful for the growing\r\n    interest there is for the cause throughout the free States, for\r\n    it certainly is on the increase, even in our own locality. There\r\n    are those who, five years since, were (ashamed, must I say it!)\r\n    to bear the appellation of \"_Anti-slavery_,\" who can now\r\n    manfully bear the one then still more repellant of\r\n    _Abolitionist_. All this we wish to feel thankful for, and wish\r\n    their number may never grow less.\r\n\r\n    The excitement relative to the heroic John Brown, now in his\r\n    grave, has affected the whole North, or at least every one who\r\n    has a heart in his breast, particularly this portion of the\r\n    State, which is so decidedly Anti-slavery.\r\n\r\n    At a meeting of our Society, to-day, at which your letter was\r\n    read, it was thought best that I should reply to it, a request\r\n    with which I cheerfully comply. We would like to hear from you,\r\n    and learn the directions to be given to our box, which will be\r\n    ready to send as soon as we can hear from you. Please give us\r\n    all necessary information, and oblige our Society.\r\n\r\n    You have the kind wishes and prayers of all the members, that\r\n    you may be the instrument of doing much good to those in bonds,\r\n    and may God speed the time when every yoke shall be broken, and\r\n    let the oppressed go free.\r\n\r\n    Yours, truly,\r\n\r\n    Mrs. DR. BROOKS.\r\n\r\n    P.S. I have just learned that John Brown's body passed through\r\n    Dunkirk, a few miles from this place, yesterday. A funeral\r\n    sermon is to be preached in this place one week from next\r\n    Sabbath, for the good old man.\r\n\r\n    Mrs. DR. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    ELLINGTON, Jan. 2d, 1860.\r\n\r\n    WILLIAM STILL:--Dear Sir:--Enclosed are $2,00, to pay freightage\r\n    on the box of bedding, wearing apparel, etc., that has been sent\r\n    to your address. It has been thought best to send you a schedule\r\n    of the contents of said box. Trusting it will be acceptable, and\r\n    be the means of assisting the poor fugitive on his perilous way,\r\n    you have the prayers of our Society, that you may be prospered\r\n    in your work of mercy, and you surely will meet with your reward\r\n    according to your merciful acts.\r\n\r\n    Two bed quilts, 32, $8,00; five bed quilts, 24, $15,00; one bed\r\n    quilt, 28, $3,50; two pairs cotton socks, 3, 75 cents; three\r\n    pairs cotton stockings, 4, $1,50; one pair woolen stockings, 6,\r\n    75 cents; one pair woolen stockings, 4, 50 cents; three pair\r\n    woolen socks, 2, 75 cents; five pair woolen socks, 3, $1,88;\r\n    eight chemise, 32, $4,50; thirteen men's shirts, 66 cents,\r\n    $8,58; one pair pants, 12, $1,50; six pair overall pants, 80\r\n    cents, $4,80; three pair pillow cases, $1,00; three calico\r\n    aprons, 2, 75 cents; three sun-bonnets, 2, 75 cents; two small\r\n    aprons, 1, 25 cents; one alpaca cape, 8, $1,00; two capes, 1, 25\r\n    cents; one black shawl, 4, 50 cents. Total, $56,51.\r\n\r\n    The foregoing is a correct list of the articles and the\r\n    appraisal of the same. Please acknowledge the receipt of the\r\n    letter and box, and oblige the Anti-slavery Society of\r\n    Ellington.\r\n\r\n    Mrs. DR. BROOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe road was doing a flourishing business during the short time that\r\nthis station received aid and sympathy from the Ladies' Anti-slavery\r\nSociety of Ellington, and little did we dream that its existence would\r\nso soon be rendered null and void by the utter overthrow of Slavery.\r\n\r\nWe have great pleasure in stating that beyond our borders also, across\r\nthe ocean, there came help to a laudable degree in the hour of need. The\r\nnumbers of those who aided in this special work, however, were very few\r\nand far between, a hundred per cent. less (so far as the receipts of the\r\nPhiladelphia Committee were concerned), than was supposed by\r\nslave-holders and their sympathizers, judging from their oft repeated\r\nallegations on this subject.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that the American Anti-slavery Society and kindred\r\nassociations, received liberal contributions from a few warm-hearted and\r\nstaunch abolitionists abroad, to aid the great work of abolishing\r\nSlavery. In reference to the Philadelphia Vigilance Committee, we are\r\nsafe in saying, that, except from a few sources, no direct aid came. How\r\ntrue this was of other stations, we do not pretend to know or speak, but\r\nin the directions above alluded to, we feel that the cause was placed\r\nunder lasting obligations. The Webbs of Dublin, and the Misses Wighams,\r\nof Scotland, representatives of the Edinburgh Ladies' Emancipation\r\nSociety, were constantly in correspondence with leading abolitionists in\r\ndifferent parts of the country, manifesting a deep interest in the\r\ngeneral cause, and were likewise special stockholders of the Underground\r\nRail Road of Philadelphia. In common with stockholders at home, these\r\ntrans-atlantic investors were willing to receive their shares of\r\ndividends in the answer of a good conscience, or, in other words, from\r\nthe satisfaction and pleasure derivable from a consciousness of having\r\ndone what they could to alleviate the sufferings of the oppressed\r\nstruggling to be free. Having thus shown their faith by their works it\r\nwould be unjust not to make honorable mention of them.\r\n\r\nLast, though not least, at the risk of wounding the feelings of one who\r\npreferred not to let the left hand know what the right hand doeth, we\r\nmay contemplate the philanthropic labors of one, whose generosity and\r\nbenevolence knew no bounds; whose friendship devotion and liberality,\r\nwere felt in all the principal stations of the Underground Rail Road;\r\nwhose heart went out after the millions in fetters, the fleeing\r\nfugitive, the free, proscribed, the ignorant deprived of education;\r\nwhose house was the home of the advocate of the slave from the United\r\nStates, especially if he wore a colored skin or had been a slave. We\r\nwould not venture to say how many of the enslaved this kind hand helped\r\nto purchase (Frederick Douglass and many others, being of the number.)\r\n\r\nHow many were assisted in procuring an education, how many who pined in\r\nslave prisons were aided, how many fleeing over the perilous Underground\r\nRail Road were benefited, the All-seeing Eye alone knoweth;\r\nnevertheless, we are happy to be able to give our readers some idea of\r\nthe unwearied labors of the friend to whom we allude. Here again we are\r\ncompelled to resort to private correspondence which took place when\r\nCotton was King, and the Slave-power of the South could boastingly say,\r\nin the language of the apocalyptic woman, \"I sit as a queen, and shall\r\nsee no sorrow,\" when that power was maddened to desperation, by the\r\nheroism of the martyr, John Brown, and the fettered bondmen were ever\r\nand anon traveling over the Underground Rail Road. In this \"darkest\r\nhour, just before the break of day,\" the heart of the friend of whom we\r\nspeak, was greatly moved to consider the wants of the oppressed in\r\nvarious directions.\r\n\r\nHow worthily and successfully her labors gave evidence of an earnest\r\ndevotion to freedom, the mode and measures adopted by her, to awaken\r\nsympathy in the breast of the benevolent of her own countrymen, and how\r\nnoble her example, may be learned from a small pamphlet and explanatory\r\nletters which, when written, were intended especially for private use,\r\nbut which we now feel constrained to copy from a sense of justice to\r\ndisinterested philanthropy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAMPHLET, AND LETTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MRS. ANNA H. RICHARDSON, OF NEWCASTLE, ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE FRIENDS OF THE SLAVE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    DEAR FRIENDS--For some months past my dear husband and I have\r\n    wished very gratefully to thank you for having so kindly\r\n    assisted us in various Anti-Slavery efforts, and we now think it\r\n    quite time to give an account of our stewardship, and also to\r\n    lay before you several items of interesting intelligence\r\n    received from different parts of the United States. We will\r\n    thank you to look upon this intelligence as private, and must\r\n    request you to guard against any portion of it being reprinted.\r\n\r\n    WILLIAM S. BAILEY.--We have had great pleasure in forwarding\r\n    £222 to our valued correspondent, William S. Bailey, of Newport,\r\n    Kentucky; £160 of this sum in response to a circular issued at\r\n    Newcastle in the summer of last year, and received by our\r\n    friend, David Oliver, who acted as treasurer, and the remainder\r\n    chiefly collected by our dear young friends in England and\r\n    Ireland, after reading the account of his little daughter,\r\n    \"Laura.\" This money has been very thankfully acknowledged, with\r\n    the exception of the last remittance just now on the road.\r\n\r\n    Most of our readers will be aware that W.S. Bailey's\r\n    printing-office and premises were again ruthlessly attacked\r\n    after the Harper's Ferry outbreak, on the unfounded assumption\r\n    that he was meditating a similar proceeding, and that it was\r\n    unsafe for a free press to be any longer tolerated in Kentucky.\r\n    His forms and type were accordingly dragged through the streets\r\n    of Newport, and a considerable portion of them flung by a mob\r\n    (of \"gentlemen\") into the Ohio River. A few extracts from his\r\n    own letters will pretty fully explain both his past and present\r\n    position. The subscription list on his behalf is still open, and\r\n    any further assistance for this heroic man and his noble-hearted\r\n    family will be very gratefully received and forwarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"NEWPORT, KENTUCKY, Nov. 19th, 1859.\r\n\r\n        \"From my letter of the 7th inst. you will have learned\r\n        the sad intelligence that my printing-office has been\r\n        destroyed by a brutal mob of Pro-Slavery men. Through\r\n        the money I received from you and other friends in this\r\n        country I was moving the cause of freedom in all parts\r\n        of Kentucky. The people seemed to grasp our platform\r\n        with eagerness, and the slaveholders became alarmed to\r\n        see their wish to read and discuss its simple truths.\r\n        Hence they plotted together to devise a stratagem by\r\n        which they could destroy _The Free South_, and in the\r\n        meantime the Harper's Ferry difficulty, by Mr. Brown,\r\n        was seized upon to excite the people against me, and the\r\n        most extravagant lies were told about me, as trying to\r\n        excite slaves to rebellion; intending to seize the\r\n        United States barracks at this place, arm the negroes,\r\n        and commence war upon slave-holders. All these lies were\r\n        told as profound secrets to the people by the tools of\r\n        the slave-power. But these lies have already exploded,\r\n        and the people are resuming their common sense again.\r\n\r\n        \"I tried your plan of non-resistance with all my power.\r\n        I pleaded with all the earnestness of my soul, and so\r\n        did my wife and daughters, but though I am certain many\r\n        were moved in conscience against the savage outrage, and\r\n        did their work with a stinging heart, yet they felt that\r\n        they must stick to their party, and complete the\r\n        destruction. Slavery, indeed, makes the most hardened\r\n        savages the world ever knew. The savage war-whoop of the\r\n        Indian never equalled their dastardly cry of 'shoot\r\n        him,' 'cut his throat,' 'stab him,' and such like words\r\n        most maliciously spoken.\"  *  *  \"Slavery is the cause\r\n        of this devilish spirit in men; but this outrage has\r\n        gained me many friends, and will do much towards putting\r\n        down Slavery in the state. It will also add many\r\n        thousand votes to the republican presidential candidate\r\n        in 1860. God grant it may work out a great good!\"  *  *\r\n        *  *  \"I Want to get started again as soon as I possibly\r\n        can.

The\r\n        renewed obligations under which the good people of\r\n        England, through your instrumentality, place me and my\r\n        abused people, call for expressions of gratitude from\r\n        both me and them beyond my ability to pen. But you can\r\n        imagine how we ought to feel in our trials and wants to\r\n        such kind friends as you. Neither I nor my Anti-Slavery\r\n        friends here can express our thankfulness in the elegant\r\n        language your better educated countrymen may feel we\r\n        should use, but, by the Omnipotent Judge of all hearts,\r\n        I trust our feeble effort will be accepted, and you and\r\n        yours be blessed and protected now and for ever. Such\r\n        encouragement strengthens me in the belief that the\r\n        Spirit of God is abroad in the hearts of the people,\r\n        moving them to sympathize with the poor, subjected\r\n        slave.\"  *  *  *  *  \"I have the promise of abler pens\r\n        to aid me when I get started again; and I am glad to see\r\n        that a poor working-man and his family have been the\r\n        means of calling the attention of men of letters to\r\n        assist in raising from the dust a crushed race of men;\r\n        and although the red clouds of war hover thick around\r\n        us, and vengeance lurks in secret places, I trust,\r\n        through the guidance of an All-wise Director, to steer\r\n        safely through the angry tide that now so often ebbs and\r\n        flows around me; but should I fall, I trust, dear lady,\r\n        that my dear wife and family may be remembered by the\r\n        good and true.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"NEWPORT, May 25th, 1860.\r\n\r\n        \"I am glad to tell you that we feel it a great victory\r\n        over the slave power to be able to rise again from our\r\n        ruins, and in the face of slave-owning despots denounce\r\n        their inhumanity and their sins.

The death of John Brown is yet to be\r\n        atoned for, by the slave-holding oligarchy. His undying\r\n        spirit haunts them by day and by night, and in the midst\r\n        of their voluptuous enjoyments, the very thought of John\r\n        Brown chills their souls and poisons their pleasures.\r\n        Their tarring and feathering of good citizens; their\r\n        riding them upon rails, and ducking them, in dirty\r\n        ponds; their destruction of liberty presses, and the\r\n        hanging of John Brown and his friends, to intimidate men\r\n        from the advocacy of freedom, will all come tumbling\r\n        upon their own heads as a just retribution for their\r\n        outrageous brutality.

At a\r\n    village in that State, called Berea, (situated in Madison\r\n    county), a little band of Christian men and women, had been\r\n    pursuing their useful labors for some years past. They avowedly\r\n    held Anti-slavery sentiments, but this was the beginning and end\r\n    of their offending. They possessed a farm and saw-mill, etc.,\r\n    and had established a flourishing school. These good people were\r\n    quietly following their usual employments, when, in the early\r\n    part of last winter, sixty-two armed Kentuckians rode upon\r\n    horseback to their cottage doors, and summarily informed them\r\n    that they must leave the State in ten days' time, or would be\r\n    expelled from it forcibly. All pleading was hopeless, and any\r\n    attempt at self-defence out of the question. They bowed before\r\n    the storm, and hastily gathering up their garments, in three\r\n    days' time were on their road to Ohio. Their three Christian\r\n    pastors took the same course. One of the latter has since\r\n    returned to Kentucky, to bury his youngest little boy, in a\r\n    grave-yard attached to one of the churches there. He was enabled\r\n    to preach to the people who assembled on the occasion, but was\r\n    not allowed to remain in his native State.\r\n\r\n    Another of the exiles ventured to go back to Berea, but this\r\n    immediately led to an outbreak of popular feeling, for his\r\n    saw-mill was set on fire by the mob, and presently destroyed.\r\n    The exiles are consequently still in Ohio, or wandering about in\r\n    search of employment. We have been privileged in receiving two\r\n    letters respecting them, from one of their excellent pastors,\r\n    John G. Fee. This gentleman is himself, the son of a\r\n    slave-holder, but gave up his earthly patrimony many years since\r\n    for conscience' sake, and has since made it the business of his\r\n    life to proclaim the gospel in its purity, and to use every\r\n    available means for directing all to Christ.\r\n\r\n    When speaking of Berea, Mr. Fee remarks: \"The land was poor, but\r\n    the situation beautiful, with good water, and a favorable\r\n    location, in some respects. We could have had locations more\r\n    fertile and more easy of access, but more exposed to the\r\n    slave-power. It was five miles from a turnpike road, with quite\r\n    a population around it for a slave State.\"\r\n\r\n    In one of Mr. Fee's letters he introduces a subject which we\r\n    wish especially to bring before our friends, feeling almost sure\r\n    that many of them will respond to its importance:\r\n\r\n    \"You ask, he says, if there are not noble-hearted young people\r\n    in slave-holding families? There is one whom I desire to commend\r\n    to your special prayer and regard, Elizabeth Rawlings, daughter\r\n    of John H. Rawlings, of Madison county, Kentucky. He was once a\r\n    slave-holder, but has twice been a delegate to our Free-soil\r\n    National Conventions, and is a strong friend of freedom. His\r\n    daughter has had small opportunities for acquiring knowledge,\r\n    but was in our school at Berea, and making rapid progress. Our\r\n    school was not only Anti-slavery, but avowedly Anti-caste. This\r\n    made it the more odious. When Mr. Rogers and others were about\r\n    to be driven away, she announced that she would continue the\r\n    school on the same principles. Accordingly she went into the\r\n    school-room after a few days, with a little band of small\r\n    scholars, and has perseveringly kept it up. This noble and\r\n    brave-hearted young woman is about twenty-two years of age; has\r\n    a very vigorous mind; acquires knowledge very rapidly; is very\r\n    modest; and is, I trust, a true believer in Christ. I desire to\r\n    see her fitted for the post of teacher. One year's study would\r\n    greatly benefit her. She has not gone beyond grammar and\r\n    arithmetic. I have not means or would at once give her those\r\n    advantages she needs. I once had a small patrimony, but expended\r\n    it in freedom's cause, and now live on the small salary of a\r\n    [Home] Missionary. I have a daughter of fifteen, as far advanced\r\n    as Miss Rawlings. I want to train and educate them both for\r\n    teaching, and had thought to educate the latter, and suggest to\r\n    some one to educate the other. I do not urge, but simply\r\n    suggest. This might be another cord binding the two continents.\r\n    Lewis Tappan, of New York, would receive to transmit, and I\r\n    would report.\"\r\n\r\n    Now if we may lay before you, dear friends, our hearts' inquiry,\r\n    it is this: \"Cannot we in England, raise £50 or £60 for one\r\n    year's schooling for these two dear girls, Elizabeth Rawlings\r\n    and J.G. Fee's daughter?\" It seems to us, that the one deserves\r\n    it from her noble daring, the other as a little tribute to her\r\n    father's virtues. How delightful it would be if these two young\r\n    people could become able teachers of our own rearing, and in\r\n    days to come, be looked to as maintaining schools of an elevated\r\n    character upon their native soil! We have laid the case before a\r\n    few kind friends, and already had the pleasure of forwarding £8\r\n    to Mr. Fee's care, on behalf of his valued young friend,\r\n    Elizabeth Rawlings.\r\n\r\n    CORNELIA WILLIAMS.--The next person to be referred to is\r\n    Cornelia Williams, a bright young niece of our friend, Henry H.\r\n    Garnet's, whom many of our friends kindly assisted to redeem\r\n    from Slavery, in North Carolina, about three years since. We\r\n    rejoice to say this dear girl is going on very satisfactorily.\r\n    She has been diligently pursuing her studies in a school at\r\n    Nantucket, and appears to be much esteemed by all who know her.\r\n    She kindly sends us a little letter now and then, again\r\n    returning her glowing thanks to all who assisted in procuring\r\n    her freedom. Her mother, Dinah Williams (also a slave a few\r\n    years since, and redeemed in part by the surplus of 'the Weims\r\n    Ransom Fund'), has married an estimable Baptist minister within\r\n    the last year, and Cornelia resides under their roof.\r\n\r\n    FREDERICK DOUGLASS.--It is known that our much-valued friend,\r\n    Frederick Douglass, left this country suddenly for America last\r\n    spring, chiefly on account of the decease of a most beloved\r\n    little girl. Till quite recently he was intending to return to\r\n    England very soon, but this is for the present delayed, on\r\n    account of increasing and pressing engagements in the United\r\n    States. We take the liberty of quoting an extract from one of\r\n    his letters:\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"ROCHESTER, July 2d, 1860.\r\n\r\n        \"You hold up before me the glorious promises contained\r\n        in the sacred Scriptures. These are needed by none more\r\n        than by those who have presumed to put themselves to the\r\n        work of accomplishing the abolition of Slavery in this\r\n        country. There is scarcely one single interest, social,\r\n        moral, religious, or physical, which is not in some way\r\n        connected with this stupendous evil. On the side of the\r\n        oppressor there is power, now as in the earlier days of\r\n        the world. I find much comfort in the thought that I am\r\n        but a passenger on board of this ship of life. I have\r\n        not the management committed to me. I am to obey orders,\r\n        and leave the rest to the great Captain whose wisdom is\r\n        able to direct. I have only to go on in His fear and in\r\n        His spirit, uttering with pen and tongue the whole truth\r\n        against Slavery, leaving to Him the honor and the glory\r\n        of destroying this mighty work of the devil. I long for\r\n        the end of my people's bondage, and would give all I\r\n        possess to witness the great jubilee; but God can wait,\r\n        and surely I may. If He, whose pure eyes cannot look\r\n        upon sin with allowance, can permit the day of freedom\r\n        to be deferred, I certainly can work and wait. The times\r\n        are just now a little brighter; but I will walk by\r\n        faith, not by sight, for all grounds of hope founded on\r\n        external appearance, have thus far signally failed and\r\n        broken down under me. Twenty years ago, Slavery did\r\n        really _seem_ to be rapidly hastening to its fall, but\r\n        ten years ago, the Fugitive Slave Bill, and the efforts\r\n        to enforce it, changed the whole appearance of the\r\n        struggle. Anti-slavery in an abolition sense, has been\r\n        ever since battling against heavy odds, both in Church\r\n        and State. Nevertheless, God reigns, and we need not\r\n        despair, and I for one do not. I know, at any rate, no\r\n        better work for me during the brief period I am to stay\r\n        on the earth, than is found in pleading the cause of the\r\n        down-trodden and the dumb.\r\n\r\n        \"Since I reached home I have had the satisfaction of\r\n        passing nearly a score on to Canada, only two women\r\n        among them all. The constant meeting with these\r\n        whip-scarred brothers will not allow me to become\r\n        forgetful of the four millions still in bonds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    Our friends may, perhaps, remember that the cost of _Frederick\r\n    Douglass' paper_ is but five shillings per annum (with the\r\n    exception of a penny per month at the door for postage.) It is a\r\n    very interesting publication, and amply repays the trifling\r\n    outlay. F.D. would be glad to increase the number of his British\r\n    readers. He also continues gratefully to receive any aid from\r\n    this country for the assistance of the fugitives who are so\r\n    often taking refuge under his roof. Another letter of his\r\n    remarks, when speaking of them: \"They usually tarry with us only\r\n    during the night, and are forwarded to Canada by the morning\r\n    train. We give them supper, lodging, and breakfast; pay their\r\n    expenses, and give them a half dollar over.\"\r\n\r\n    FUGITIVE SLAVES.--We next turn to the communication of another\r\n    warm friend to the fugitives in the State of ----. The following\r\n    is an extract from a recent letter of his:\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"We have had within the last week just nineteen\r\n        Underground passengers. Fifteen came last Saturday,\r\n        between the hours of six in the morning and eleven at\r\n        night. Three only were females, wives of men in the\r\n        parties, the rest were all able-bodied young men. That\r\n        they were all likely-looking it needed no southern eye\r\n        to decide, and that their hearts burned within them for\r\n        freedom was apparent in every look of their\r\n        countenances. But it is only of one arrival that my time\r\n        will allow me to speak on the present occasion.\r\n\r\n        This consisted of two married couples, and two single\r\n        young men. They had been a week on the way. To\r\n        accomplish the desired object they could see no way so\r\n        feasible as to cross the ---- Bay. By inquiry they\r\n        gained instructions as to the direction they should\r\n        steer to strike for the lighthouse on the opposite\r\n        shore. Consequently they invested six dollars in a\r\n        little boat, and at once prepared themselves for this\r\n        most fearful adventure. To the water and their little\r\n        bark they stealthily repaired, and off they started. For\r\n        some distance they rowed not far from the shore. Being\r\n        in sight of land, they were spied by the ever-watchful\r\n        slave-holder or some one not favorable to their escape.\r\n        Hence a small boat, containing four white men, soon put\r\n        out after the fugitives. On overhauling them, stern\r\n        orders were given to surrender. The boat the runaways\r\n        were in was claimed, if not the party themselves. With\r\n        determined words the fugitives declared that the boat\r\n        was their own property, and that they would not give it\r\n        up; they said they would die before they would do so. At\r\n        this sign of resistance one of the white men, with an\r\n        oar, struck the head of one of the fugitives, which\r\n        knocked him down. At the same moment another white man\r\n        seized the chain of their boat, and the struggle became\r\n        fearful in the extreme for a few moments. However, the\r\n        same spirit that prompted the effort to be free, moved\r\n        one of the heroic black bondmen to apply the oar to the\r\n        head of one of their pursuers, which straightway laid\r\n        him prostrate. The whites, like old Apollyon in the\r\n        Pilgrim's Progress, at this decided indication that\r\n        their precious lives might not be spared if they did not\r\n        avail themselves of an immediate retreat, suddenly\r\n        parted from their antagonists. Not being contented,\r\n        however, thus to give up the struggle, after getting\r\n        some yards off, they fired a loaded gun in the midst of\r\n        the fugitives, peppering two of them considerably about\r\n        the head and face, and one about the arms. As the shot\r\n        was light they were not much damaged, however, at any\r\n        rate not discouraged. Not forgetting which way to steer\r\n        across the bay, in the direction of the lighthouse, they\r\n        rowed for that point with all possible speed, but their\r\n        bark being light, and the wind and rough water by no\r\n        means manageable, ere they reached the desired shore\r\n        they were carried a considerable distance off their\r\n        course, in the immediate vicinity of a small island.\r\n        Leaving their boat they went upon the island, the women\r\n        sick, and there reposed without food, utterly ignorant\r\n        of where they were for one whole day and night, without\r\n        being able to conjecture when or where they should find\r\n        free land for which they had so long and fervently\r\n        prayed. However, after thus resting, feeling compelled\r\n        to start on again, they set off on foot. They had not\r\n        walked a mile ere, providentially, they fell in with an\r\n        oyster man and a little boy waiting for the tide. With\r\n        him they ventured to converse, and soon felt that he\r\n        might be trusted with, at least, a hint of their\r\n        condition. Accordingly they made him acquainted in part\r\n        with their piteous story, and he agreed to bring them\r\n        within fifteen miles of ---- for twenty-five dollars,\r\n        all the capital they had. Being as good as his word, he\r\n        did not leave them fifteen miles off the city, but\r\n        brought them directly to it.\"  *  *  *  * \"How happy\r\n        they were at finding themselves in the hands of friends,\r\n        and surrounded with flattering prospects of soon\r\n        reaching Canada you may imagine, but I could not\r\n        describe.\"[A]\r\n\r\n        [Footnote A: In those days the writer in giving\r\n        information enjoined the utmost secresy, considering\r\n        that the cause might be sadly damaged simply by being\r\n        inadvertently exposed even by friends, thousands of\r\n        miles away. The Pro-slavery-mob spirit at that time was\r\n        also very rampant in Philadelphia and other northern\r\n        cities, threatening abolitionists and all concerned in\r\n        the work of aiding the slave.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Thanks to the benevolent bounty of several kind donors, we had\r\n    lately the pleasure of sending a few pounds to the writer of the\r\n    foregoing letter. We omit his name and residence. He belongs,\r\n    like Douglass, to the proscribed race. Who would not help these\r\n    generous-hearted men, who are devoting their whole energies to\r\n    the well-being of the crushed and downtrodden? We are the more\r\n    encouraged to send out this little sheet, made up of thanks and\r\n    requisitions, because occasional inquiries are reaching us of\r\n    \"What can we do for the slave? We are hearing but little about\r\n    him, and do not know how to work on his behalf.\" Allow us to say\r\n    to one and all, who may be thus circumstanced, that we do not\r\n    look for great things, but that if they can levy a shilling a\r\n    year from all who feel for the injured bondman, these little\r\n    sums would soon mount up and prove of incalculable service to\r\n    those who are struggling for freedom. As to the special destiny\r\n    of these shillings or half-crowns, let the subscribers choose\r\n    for themselves, and their kind aid will be sure to be truly\r\n    welcome to the party receiving it. We do not ask for such\r\n    contributions to be forwarded through Newcastle unless this be a\r\n    matter of convenience to those concerned. If there be other\r\n    modes of sending to the United States within the reach of the\r\n    friends, who receive this paper, let them by all means be used.\r\n    We are always happy to receive aid for the fugitives or for any\r\n    other Anti-slavery cause, and consider it no trouble at all to\r\n    send it on, but do not wish to be monopolizing. As far as\r\n    Kentucky is concerned, that State being distant, and mob-law\r\n    rampant there, we shall continue gratefully to receive\r\n    assistance on its behalf, and to avail ourselves of the\r\n    accustomed mode of reaching it, this having been proved to be\r\n    both safe and easy.\r\n\r\n    FREE LABOR PRODUCE.--And lastly, as to the long-prized\r\n    principle, to our minds the very alphabet of Anti-Slavery\r\n    action, the importance of encouraging the growth and consumption\r\n    of Free produce rather than that raised by the sweat and blood\r\n    of the bondman. Our convictions of the righteousness of this\r\n    course are as strong as they ever were; but perhaps we hoped too\r\n    much, relied too fondly on the conscientiousness of the British\r\n    Anti-Slavery public, in supposing that a sufficient number of\r\n    individuals could be found prepared to make a slight sacrifice\r\n    for humanity's sake, and to keep the oppressed continually in\r\n    mind by a little untiring pains-taking. We hardly supposed that\r\n    the most strenuous efforts in this direction would be enough to\r\n    affect the British market; but we did believe, and believe\r\n    still, that not only is there a consistency in a preference for\r\n    free produce, but that this preference is encouraging to the\r\n    free laborer, and that humanly speaking nothing is more\r\n    calculated to nerve his hand and heart for vigorous effort. The\r\n    principle of abstinence from slave produce may be smiled at, but\r\n    we are quite sure it is an honest one, and, as a good old\r\n    proverb observes, \"It takes a great many bushels full of earth\r\n    to bury a truth.\"\r\n\r\n    But while this self-denying protest has been going on in a few\r\n    limited circles, how great is the advance that free labor has\r\n    been making within the last two years! Who is to say whether\r\n    some of those quiet testimonies may not have contributed to\r\n    erect that mighty machinery that is now adding to its wheels and\r\n    springs from day to day, and which bids fair at no distant\r\n    period to supersede slave labor and its long train of sorrow and\r\n    oppression?\r\n\r\n    Earnest lectures have just been delivered in Newcastle by our\r\n    colored friend, Dr. M.R. Delany, lately engaged in a tour of\r\n    observation in West Africa, where he longs to establish a\r\n    nourishing colony of his people, whose express object shall be\r\n    to put down the abominable Slave-trade and to cultivate free\r\n    cotton and other tropical produce. We wish this brave man every\r\n    encouragement in his noble enterprise. He has secured the\r\n    confidence of \"The African Aid Society,\" in London, one of whose\r\n    earliest measures has been to assist him with funds. The present\r\n    Secretary of the society is Frederick W. Fitzgerald, 7 Adam\r\n    Street, Strand, London.\r\n\r\n    And who need speak of the Zambesi and Dr. Livingston, or of\r\n    Central or Eastern Africa; of India, or Australia, or of the\r\n    prolific West India Islands?\r\n\r\n    As we prepare this little sheet, a kind letter has come in from\r\n    Stephen Bourne, for many years a stipendiary magistrate in\r\n    Jamaica, and now the ardent promoter of a cotton-growing company\r\n    of that island. He says to us, when writing from London, on the\r\n    19th inst., \"Our scheme embraces more than meets the eye, and to\r\n    illustrate this, I send a map (with prospectus) of the proposed\r\n    estate, by which you will see that we reckon on obtaining cotton\r\n    by free labor and by mechanical agency from Jamaica, at a price\r\n    so far below that at which it can be produced by slave labor,\r\n    that if we succeed, we shall put an end to the whole system, as\r\n    no one will be able to afford to carry it on in competition with\r\n    free labor.\"  *  *  * \"Jamaica is much nearer and easier of\r\n    access for fugitives from Cuba and Porto Rico, than Canada is to\r\n    Georgia, Virginia, or Louisiana. If, therefore, we can offer\r\n    them an asylum and profitable employment on the estate, we shall\r\n    open up a new Underground Rail Road, or rather enable the slaves\r\n    to escape from Cuba by getting into a boat, and in one night\r\n    finding their way to freedom.\"  *  *  *  \"There is no doubt they\r\n    could do this at much less risk than slaves now incur, in order\r\n    to obtain liberty in America.\"\r\n\r\n    The proposed estate in Jamaica consists of about one thousand\r\n    acres, and the shares in this company are £10 each, £1 only to\r\n    be called up immediately, the rest by instalments. The liability\r\n    is limited. Full information may be obtained by addressing\r\n    Stephen Bourne, Esq., 55 Charing Cross, London, or the Secretary\r\n    of the \"Jamaica Cotton-growing Company,\" C. W. Streatfield, Esq.\r\n    We rejoice to see that this new company is being supported not\r\n    only by benevolent philanthropists and capitalists in London,\r\n    but by experienced Manchester manufacturers; among the rest by\r\n    the excellent Thomas Clegg, so well known for his persevering\r\n    efforts in West Africa, and by Thomas Bazley, M.P. for\r\n    Manchester, and a most extensive cotton spinner. Their mills\r\n    would alone, consume the cotton grown on three such estates as\r\n    that which it is proposed to cultivate. There is abundant room,\r\n    therefore, for cultivation of cotton by the emancipated\r\n    freeholders.\r\n\r\n    Communications have also reached us from Demerara. Charles\r\n    Rattray, a valuable Scotch missionary in that colony, was in\r\n    England last spring, and went back to his adopted country with\r\n    his mind full fraught with the importance of cotton growing\r\n    within its borders. He happened to have small samples of\r\n    Demerara cotton with him. These were shown to cotton-brokers and\r\n    manufacturers in Liverpool and Manchester, and were pronounced\r\n    to be most excellent--so much so, that specimen gins and a\r\n    supply of cotton-seed were kindly presented to him at the latter\r\n    place, before he left England. Mr. Rattray is now bringing the\r\n    subject before his people, and is also intending to plant with\r\n    cotton some ground belonging to the Mission station.\r\n\r\n    But we will not further enlarge. Commending our cause to Him,\r\n    who has promised never to forget the poor and needy, and that in\r\n    His own good time He will arise for their deliverance and \"break\r\n    every yoke.\"\r\n\r\n    I remain, sincerely and respectfully, your friend,\r\n\r\n    Anna H. Richardson.\r\n\r\n    _54 Westmoreland Terrace_, _Newcastle-on-Tyne, 9 mo., 22, 1860._\r\n\r\n    P.S. Since writing the above, we have seen it stated in the\r\n    _Principia,_ a New York paper, that William S. Bailey has been\r\n    arrested on a charge of publishing an incendiary paper, and held\r\n    to bail in the sum of $1,000, to appear before the Circuit\r\n    Court, in November next. It is further stated that one of the\r\n    two magistrates by whom W.S. Bailey was examined, and held to\r\n    bail on this charge, was the chosen leader of the mob that\r\n    destroyed his type and printing press.\r\n\r\n    We have yet to see what will be the end of this cruel conflict.\r\n    Let us not desert our suffering friend and his noble-hearted\r\n    family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS TO THE WRITER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    WESTMORELAND TERRACE, December 28, 1860.\r\n\r\n    MY ESTEEMED FRIEND:--I received thy touching letter of the 10th\r\n    inst. a few days since, and hasten to assure thee of our\r\n    heart-felt sympathy, and most lively interest in the present\r\n    tremendous state of things around you. At the same time, I\r\n    cannot tell thee how glad and thankful we feel, that with God's\r\n    help thou art determined to persevere and not in any way flinch\r\n    in this day of sore trial. \"Be thou faithful unto death, and I\r\n    will give thee a crown of life.\" \"Be strong, fear not.\" \"In the\r\n    fear of the Lord is strong confidence; and his children shall\r\n    have a place of refuge.\" One thing, too, is sure, \"that all\r\n    things will work together for the good\" of those who love their\r\n    Lord, that He will never, never forsake them whatever their\r\n    outward trials may be.\r\n\r\n    I think, dear friend, thou shouldst be careful not to be about\r\n    alone, particularly in the evening. We heard from W.S. Bailey\r\n    the other day, and he spoke of the advantage of several kind\r\n    friends sticking close to him under recent circumstances at\r\n    Alexandria, when he was exposed to the spite and rage of\r\n    slave-holding bullies. Would it not be well to make a habit, in\r\n    the evening in particular, of you, who are marked men, going\r\n    about in little companies? Wicked men are generally cowards; and\r\n    I think would hesitate more to do a bad act in the presence of\r\n    observers. I think thou wouldst receive a little letter from me\r\n    a day or two after thine was written, through our friend Saml.\r\n    Rhoads, enclosing £7 for the fugitives, £5 for thy own use, and\r\n    £2 for the Vigilance Committee. This letter of mine was sent off\r\n    about the 24th ult., but I conclude was not delivered till just\r\n    after thine was written. It is well to keep us fully informed of\r\n    your circumstances, whether favorable or more appalling. I do\r\n    not intend to put anything of a private character into print;\r\n    but private confidence is the creed in England, and thou needst\r\n    not fear my abusing it. I enclose the only paper that we have\r\n    printed that thou mayest see there was nothing to fear. Thou\r\n    wilt observe there is no reference either to thy own name or to\r\n    Philadelphia, and people here are not very familiar with\r\n    American topography. I am sending W.S. Bailey one of the same\r\n    papers by to-day's mail. We have merely a limited number of them\r\n    printed. I cannot very well obtain money from my friends, (with\r\n    numerous home claims constantly pressing on them), without\r\n    having something to show. Some fugitives are now beginning to\r\n    reach England. A gentleman in London wrote to me, a day or two\r\n    ago, to know if we could find a berth for a fine fellow, who had\r\n    just applied to him. He had arrived by steamer from New York,\r\n    after residing there for three years. A policeman, in the\r\n    street, good-naturedly whispered to him his own name, and then\r\n    that of his masters. He was sure that peril was at hand, and\r\n    that, having been branded for escaping before, he should be\r\n    whipped to death if taken again, so he packed up his little\r\n    wardrobe and embarked for England immediately.\r\n\r\n    Another poor fellow is in this town, recently from Charleston,\r\n    whence he escaped, among some cotton bales to Greenock. He is\r\n    getting fair wages in a saw-yard, and likes England very well,\r\n    if it were not for the thought of his poor wife and children\r\n    still in Slavery. We invited him, the other day to a\r\n    working-men's tea party, where I had been asked to make tea for\r\n    them; and he gave us quite an able account of his travels. The\r\n    men kindly invited him to join their \"Benefit Club,\" and told\r\n    him they would like to have \"a colored brother\" amongst them.\r\n\r\n    Art thou not thinking, dear friend, of asking your people to\r\n    emigrate to the African Coast, or the West India Islands? Two\r\n    gentlemen in London are writing most warmly about this. I wrote\r\n    Mr. Fitzgerald's address on the enclosed paper. Instead of being\r\n    colonizationists, in the objectionable sense, he and Mrs. Bowen\r\n    are burning with love to your people, and are fervently desirous\r\n    of doing them all the good they can. I cannot see why little\r\n    united parties should not promptly emigrate under the wing of\r\n    these gentlemen. Assure those who think and feel with thee, dear\r\n    friend, and are nobly determined to suffer rather than to sin,\r\n    that according to our very small ability we will not desert them\r\n    in their hour of trial and danger. We commend them to Him who\r\n    can do for them a thousand times more, and better than we can\r\n    either ask or think. With our united kindest remembrance,\r\n\r\n    sincerely,\r\n\r\n    Anna H. Richardson.\r\n\r\n    Westmoreland Terrace, Newcastle-On-Tyne, March 16,1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    We have lately read the life of thy brother and sister (Peter\r\n    and Vina Still), dear friend, with the deepest interest. It is a\r\n    most touching and beautiful book, and we think should be either\r\n    reprinted in England or sent over here very largely. My husband\r\n    and I are hardly acquainted with a volume more calculated to\r\n    stir up the British mind on the subject of Slavery. Great\r\n    Britain is just now getting really warm on the Anti-slavery\r\n    subject, and is longing to shake herself from being so dependent\r\n    as hitherto, on slave produce. Why, Oh! why should not the\r\n    expatriated blacks go to free countries and grow produce for\r\n    themselves and for everybody who requires it? Why not, in time,\r\n    become \"merchants and princes,\" in those countries? I am told\r\n    (as a secret) that this subject is likely, ere long, to be taken\r\n    up in high quarters in England. We are feeling hopeful, dear\r\n    friends, about thy crushed and persecuted people, for surely God\r\n    is working for them by ways and means that we know not. I have\r\n    been careful to keep it to private circles, but thy valuable\r\n    letter of last July, has been read by many with the deepest\r\n    interest. A dear young lady from Dublin is by my side, and has\r\n    but this minute returned it to me. It is but a little, but I\r\n    have gathered £4 by its perusal here and there. I am not able to\r\n    forward so small a sum in this letter, but some way wish to send\r\n    £2 of this amount for thy own use, and the other £2 to your\r\n    Vigilance Committee. It so happens that we have not anything for\r\n    the better from our own Anti-slavery Association this year. Very\r\n    sincerely thy friend, my dear husband uniting in kind regards,\r\n\r\n    Anna H. Richardson.\r\n\r\n    WOOD HOUSE, near NEWCASTLE, May 3, 1860. [An occasional rural\r\n    residence of ours, five miles from home.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    To William Still:--I have again to thank thee, dear friend, for\r\n    a kind letter and for the perusal of three letters from thy\r\n    fugitive friends. It must be truly cheering to receive such, and\r\n    their warm and affectionate gratitude must be as rich reward for\r\n    many anxieties. I conclude that it is not necessary for those\r\n    letters to be returned, but should it be so, let me know, and I\r\n    will be on the lookout for some private opportunity of returning\r\n    them to Philadelphia. Such occur now and then. We like to see\r\n    such letters. They assist us to realize the condition of these\r\n    poor wanderers. I am sorry for not having explained myself\r\n    distinctly in my last. The promised £4 were _for the fugitives_,\r\n    being gathered from various Christian friends, who gave it me\r\n    for their particular use. But we wished half of that sum to be\r\n    laid out (as on a previous occasion), at thy own discretion,\r\n    irrespective of the Vigilance Committee. I have now another £1\r\n    to add to the latter half, and would gladly have enclosed a £5\r\n    note in this envelope, but we are rather afraid of sending the\r\n    actual money in letters, and our London bankers do not like to\r\n    remit small sums. I shall continue to watch for the first\r\n    opportunity of forwarding the above.\r\n\r\n    Our valued friend, Samuel Rhoads, has been lately in heavy\r\n    sorrow. I send this through his medium, but fear to add more\r\n    lest I should make his letter too heavy. With our united kind\r\n    regards, very truly, thy friend,\r\n\r\n    Anna H. Richardson.\r\n\r\n    54, Westmoreland Terrace, June 8, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Dear Friend:--William Still:--It is a good plan to send me these\r\n    interesting communications. The letter to your coadjutor at\r\n    Elmira, reached us a few days since. That depot must not be\r\n    allowed to go down if it be possible for this to be prevented.\r\n    Perhaps J.W. Jones might be encouraged by a gift from England,\r\n    that is, by a little aid from this country, expressly for the\r\n    fugitives, being put into his hands. If you think so, I am sure\r\n    my friends would approve of this, and you can use your own\r\n    discretion in giving him our gifts in one sum or by detached\r\n    remittances. The greatest part of the money on hand, has come in\r\n    from the private perusal of thy interesting letters, and my\r\n    friends simply gave my husband and me their money for the\r\n    fugitives, leaving the exact disposal of it to our own\r\n    discretion. It has struck me of late, that if I may be allowed\r\n    to print occasional extracts from thy letters (with other\r\n    Anti-slavery information), it would greatly facilitate the\r\n    obtaining of pecuniary aid. As it is, I can lend a private\r\n    letter to a trustworthy friend, but if by any chance, this\r\n    letter got lost, it would be awkward, and it is also impossible,\r\n    of course, to lend the original in two quarters at once. Then,\r\n    again, the mechanical trouble of making copies of letters, is\r\n    not convenient; much sedentary employment does not suit my\r\n    health, and I cannot manage it. I have been thinking of late,\r\n    that if my friends in various parts of the country, could be\r\n    supplied with a small quarto, an occasional printed paper, for\r\n    private circulation, it would save a great deal of trouble, and\r\n    probably bring in considerable aid. My husband and I have long\r\n    been accustomed to preparing tracts and small periodicals for\r\n    the press, so that I think we know exactly what ought to be made\r\n    public and what not. If thou likest to give me this\r\n    discretionary power, do so, and I will endeavor to exercise it\r\n    wisely, and in a way that I feel almost certain would be in\r\n    accordance with thy wishes.\r\n\r\n    The sum now remitted through our friend, Samuel Rhoads, is £8\r\n    (eight pounds). Of this, we should like £3 to be placed at thy\r\n    own discretion, for the benefit of the fugitives, £3 (if you\r\n    approve it) in a similar way, to be handed to J.W. Jones, and £2\r\n    as formerly, to be handed to the Philadelphia Vigilance\r\n    Committee. The latter is not, however, as in past times, from\r\n    the Newcastle Anti-slavery Society, for, I am sorry to say, it\r\n    is not a sufficiently pains-taking and executive little body,\r\n    but more apt to work by fits and starts, but from our private\r\n    friends, who kindly place their money in our hands as their\r\n    Anti-slavery stewards. My friend S.R. will therefore kindly hand\r\n    for us: £3 for William Still, for fugitives; £3 for J.W. Jones,\r\n    for fugitives; £2 for Philadelphia Vigilance Committee, for\r\n    fugitives.  Total £8.\r\n\r\n    We are very sorry for thee to have to incur so much persecution.\r\n    Be of good cheer, the right will eventually triumph, if not in\r\n    this world, in that day, when all shall be eventually righted on\r\n    our Lord's right hand. Oh, for ability in the meantime, to love\r\n    Him, trust Him, confide in Him implicitly!\r\n\r\n    Many thanks for the \"Anti-slavery Standards.\" No one in this\r\n    town, takes them in, consequently we only see them occasionally.\r\n    Do any tidings reach you of our friend, Frederick Douglass? We\r\n    heard from him from Portland, but are anxiously looking for\r\n    another letter. He always spoke of thee, my friend, very kindly,\r\n    and one day, when some money had been given to him for\r\n    fugitives, said: \"You shall have part of this if you like, for\r\n    William Still,\" but I said, \"No, I will try and get some\r\n    elsewhere for him.\" Douglass left us in April, after losing his\r\n    little Annie, but wished his visit to be kept private, and hoped\r\n    to be able to return to England in August. My husband and I\r\n    agree with F.D. in political matters. We are not disunionists,\r\n    but want to mend your corrupted government. With kind regards,\r\n    sincerely thy friend, A.H.R.\r\n\r\n    We are well acquainted with William and Ellen Craft. They have\r\n    just sent us their little book.\r\n\r\n    NEWCASTLE, 5th mo., 2,1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    W. STILL:--DEAR FRIEND:--That poor fellow, who was so long\r\n    secreted, had been often in my thoughts, when laying this case\r\n    of the fugitives before our friends. I should like thee to feel\r\n    at liberty to replace the remainder of the twenty-five dollars\r\n    from the accompanying ten pounds, which I have much pleasure in\r\n    forwarding, but think it better to mention, that it may perhaps\r\n    be the last remittance for some little time from this quarter,\r\n    as I do not at present see any immediate opening for getting\r\n    more. Our worthy friend, W.S. Bailey, has lately been here, and\r\n    Dr. Cheever and W.H. Day, are expected in a week or two. From\r\n    London too, there are very earnest appeals to assist the\r\n    \"African Anti-slavery Society.\" Thank thee for the newspapers\r\n    and thy last kind note. I think thou rather overrates my little\r\n    services. What a crisis is coming! O, what will the end be? With\r\n    our united best wishes, thy sincere friend,\r\n\r\n    ANNA H. RICHARDSON.\r\n\r\n    £7 of this money is from some personally unknown friend at\r\n    Lancaster; £5 from two nice little children of my acquaintance.\r\n\r\n    54 WESTMORELAND TERRACE,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    NEWCASTLE-ON-TYNE, Oct. 10, 1862.\r\n\r\n    I have pleasure, dear friend, in sending you £5 for your\r\n    \"contrabands,\" in response to your last letter of the 17th ult.\r\n    It is not much, but may be a little help. It will be forwarded\r\n    by our valued and mutual friend, H.H. Garnet, to whom I am\r\n    sending a remittance for his \"contrabands,\" by the same mail.\r\n\r\n    We shall be interested in any particulars you may like to send\r\n    us, of these poor creatures, but at the same time, I dare not\r\n    hold out any hopes of considerable assistance from England, for\r\n    our own manufacturing districts are in a starving state, from\r\n    the absence of the accustomed supply of cotton, and till this\r\n    has been grown in other quarters, they will continue to have a\r\n    strong claim on every thoughtful mind. Some of us would rather\r\n    work with your colored people _in your own cause_, than with any\r\n    one else, for we _do not like the war_, and do not at all\r\n    approve of \"the American churches\" committing themselves to it\r\n    so fearfully. If your President had but taken the step at first,\r\n    he is taking now, what rivers of blood might have been stayed!\r\n    It is remarkable, how you, as a people, have been preserved to\r\n    each other, without having your own hands stained with blood.\r\n    But as to expatriation, the very thought of it is foolish. You\r\n    have been brought to America, not emigrated to it, and who on\r\n    earth has any possible right to send you away? Some of us are\r\n    almost as much displeased with the North, for talking of this,\r\n    as with the South for holding you in Slavery. What can we say to\r\n    you, but \"watch and pray,\" \"hope and wait,\" and surely, in His\r\n    own good time, the Most High will make you a pathway out of\r\n    trouble. We are delighted to hear of the good behaviour of your\r\n    people, wherever they have a fair chance of acting (on the\r\n    borders), as upright men and Christians.\r\n\r\n    Very sincerely, your friend,\r\n\r\n    To WILLIAM STILL. ANNA H. RICHARDSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMAN ESCAPING IN A BOX, 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHE WAS SPEECHLESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1857 a young woman, who had just turned her majority,\r\nwas boxed up in Baltimore by one who stood to her in the relation of a\r\ncompanion, a young man, who had the box conveyed as freight to the depot\r\nin Baltimore, consigned to Philadelphia. Nearly all one night it\r\nremained at the depot with the living agony in it, and after being\r\nturned upside down more than once, the next day about ten o'clock it\r\nreached Philadelphia. Her companion coming on in advance of the box,\r\narranged with a hackman, George Custus, to attend to having it brought\r\nfrom the depot to a designated house, Mrs. Myers', 412 S. 7th street,\r\nwhere the resurrection was to take place.\r\n\r\nCustus, without knowing exactly what the box contained, but suspecting\r\nfrom the apparent anxiety and instructions of the young man who engaged\r\nhim to go after it, that it was of great importance, while the freight\r\ncar still remained on the street, demanded it of the freight agent, not\r\nwilling to wait the usual time for the delivery of freight. At first the\r\nfreight agent declined delivering under such circumstances. The hackman\r\ninsisted by saying that he wished to despatch it in great haste, said it\r\nis all right, you know me, I have been coming here for many years every\r\nday, and will be responsible for it. The freight-master told him to\r\n\"take it and go ahead with it.\" No sooner said than done. It was placed\r\nin a one horse wagon at the instance of Custus, and driven to Seventh\r\nand Minster streets.\r\n\r\nThe secret had been intrusted to Mrs. M. by the young companion of the\r\nwoman. A feeling of horror came over the aged woman, who had been thus\r\nsuddenly entrusted with such responsibility. A few doors from her lived\r\nan old friend of the same religious faith with herself, well known as a\r\nbrave woman, and a friend of the slave, Mrs. Ash, the undertaker or\r\nshrouder, whom every body knew among the colored people. Mrs. Myers felt\r\nthat it would not be wise to move in the matter of this resurrection\r\nwithout the presence of the undertaker. Accordingly, she called Mrs. Ash\r\nin. Even her own family was excluded from witnessing the scene. The two\r\naged women chose to be alone in that fearful moment, shuddering at the\r\nthought that a corpse might meet their gaze instead of a living\r\ncreature. However, they mustered courage and pried off the lid. A woman\r\nwas discovered in the straw but no sign of life was perceptible. Their\r\nfears seemed fulfilled. \"Surely she is dead,\" thought the witnesses.\r\n\r\n\"Get up, my child,\" spake one of the women. With scarcely life enough to\r\nmove the straw covering, she, nevertheless, did now show signs of life,\r\nbut to a very faint degree. She could not speak, but being assisted\r\narose. She was straightway aided up stairs, not yet uttering a word.\r\nAfter a short while she said, \"I feel so deadly weak.\" She was then\r\nasked if she would not have some water or nourishment, which she\r\ndeclined. Before a great while, however, she was prevailed upon to take\r\na cup of tea. She then went to bed, and there remained all day, speaking\r\nbut a very little during that time. The second day she gained strength\r\nand was able to talk much better, but not with ease. The third day she\r\nbegan to come to herself and talk quite freely. She tried to describe\r\nher sufferings and fears while in the box, but in vain. In the midst of\r\nher severest agonies her chief fear was, that she would be discovered\r\nand carried back to Slavery. She had a pair of scissors with her, and in\r\norder to procure fresh air she had made a hole in the box, but it was\r\nvery slight. How she ever managed to breathe and maintain her existence,\r\nbeing in the condition of becoming a mother, it was hard to comprehend.\r\nIn this instance the utmost endurance was put to the test. She was\r\nobviously nearer death than Henry Box Brown, or any of the other box or\r\nchest cases that ever came under the notice of the Committee.\r\n\r\nIn Baltimore she belonged to a wealthy and fashionable family, and had\r\nbeen a seamstress and ladies' servant generally. On one occasion when\r\nsent of an errand for certain articles in order to complete arrangements\r\nfor the Grand Opening Ball at the Academy of Music, she took occasion\r\nnot to return, but was among the missing. Great search was made, and a\r\nlarge reward offered, but all to no purpose. A free colored woman, who\r\nwashed for the family, was suspected of knowing something of her going,\r\nbut they failing to get aught out of her, she was discharged.\r\n\r\nSoon after the arrival of this traveler at Mrs. Myers' the Committee was\r\nsent for and learned the facts as above stated. After spending some\r\nthree or four days in Mrs. Myers' family she remained in the writer's\r\nfamily about the same length of time, and was then forwarded to Canada.\r\n\r\nMrs. Myers was originally from Baltimore, and had frequently been in the\r\nhabit of receiving Underground Rail Road passengers; she had always\r\nfound Thomas Shipley, the faithful philanthropist, a present help in\r\ntime of need. The young man well knew Mrs. Myers would act with prudence\r\nin taking his companion to her house.\r\n\r\nGeorge Custus, the hackman, a colored man, was cool, sensible, and\r\nreliable in the discharge of his duty, as were the other parties,\r\ntherefore every thing was well managed.\r\n\r\nWith this interesting case our narratives end, except such facts of a\r\nlike kind as may be connected with some of the sketches of stockholders.\r\nA large number on the record book must be omitted. This is partly owing\r\nto the fact that during the first few years of our connection with the\r\nUnderground Rail Road, so little was written out in the way of\r\nnarratives, that would hardly be of sufficient interest to publish; and\r\npartly from the fact that, although there are exceptional cases even\r\namong those so omitted, that would be equally as interesting as many\r\nwhich have been inserted, time and space will not admit of further\r\nencroachment. If in any way we have erred in the task of furnishing\r\nfacts and important information touching the Underground Rail Road, it\r\nhas not been in overstating the sufferings, trials, perils, and\r\nmarvellous escapes of those described, but on the contrary. In many\r\ninstances after hearing the most painful narratives we had neither time\r\nnor inclination to write them out, except in the briefest manner, simply\r\nsufficient to identify parties, which we did, not dreaming that the dark\r\ncloud of Slavery was so soon to give way to the bright sunlight of\r\nFreedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEETING TO FORM A VIGILANCE COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs has already been intimated, others besides the Committee were deeply\r\ninterested in The Road; indeed, the little aid actually rendered by the\r\nCommittee, was comparatively insignificant, compared with the aid\r\nrendered by some who were not nominally members. To this latter class of\r\nfriends, it seems meet that we should particularly allude. Before doing\r\nso, however, simple justice to all concerned, dictates that we should\r\nhere copy the official proceedings of the first meeting and organization\r\nof the Philadelphia Vigilance Committee as it existed until the very day\r\nthat the ever to be remembered Emancipation Proclamation of Abraham\r\nLincoln, rendered the services of the organization and road no longer\r\nnecessary. It reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"PENNSYLVANIA FREEMAN,\" December 9, 1852.\r\n\r\n    Pursuant to the motion published in last week's \"Freeman,\" a\r\n    meeting was held in the Anti-slavery rooms, on the evening of\r\n    the 2d inst., for the purpose of organizing a Vigilance\r\n    Committee.\r\n\r\n    On motion Samuel Nickless was appointed chairman, and William\r\n    Still secretary. J.M. McKim then stated at some length, the\r\n    object of the meeting. He said, that the friends of the fugitive\r\n    slave had been for some years past, embarrassed, for the want of\r\n    a properly constructed active, Vigilance Committee; that the old\r\n    Committee, which used to render effective service in this field\r\n    of Anti-slavery labor, had become disorganized and scattered,\r\n    and that for the last two or three years, the duties of this\r\n    department had been performed by individuals on their own\r\n    responsibility, and sometimes in a very irregular manner; that\r\n    this had been the cause of much dissatisfaction and complaint,\r\n    and that the necessity for a remedy of this state of things was\r\n    generally felt. Hence, the call for this meeting. It was\r\n    intended now to organize a committee, which should be composed\r\n    of persons of known responsibility, and who could be relied upon\r\n    to act systematically and promptly, and with the least possible\r\n    expenditure of money in all cases that might require their\r\n    attention.\r\n\r\n    James Mott and Samuel Nickless, expressed their hearty\r\n    concurrence in what had been said, as did also B.N. Goines and\r\n    N.W. Depee. The opinion was also expressed by one or more of\r\n    these gentlemen, that the organization to be formed should be of\r\n    the simplest possible character; with no more machinery or\r\n    officers than might be necessary to hold it together and keep it\r\n    in proper working order. After some discussion, it was agreed\r\n    first to form a general committee, with a chairman, whose\r\n    business it should be to call meetings when necessity should\r\n    seem to require it, and to preside at the same; and a treasurer\r\n    to take charge of the funds; and second, to appoint out of this\r\n    general committee, an acting committee of four persons, who\r\n    should have the responsibility of attending to every case that\r\n    might require their aid, as well as the exclusive authority to\r\n    raise the funds necessary for their purpose. It was further\r\n    agreed that it should be the duty of the chairman of the Acting\r\n    Committee to keep a record of all their doings, and especially\r\n    of the money received and expended on behalf of every case\r\n    claiming their interposition.\r\n\r\n    The following persons were appointed on the General Vigilance\r\n    Committee:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    GENERAL VIGILANCE COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Robert Purvis,\r\n    William Still,\r\n\r\n    Charles H. Bustill,\r\n    P. Williamson,\r\n\r\n    Samuel Nickless,\r\n    B.N. Goines,\r\n\r\n    Morris Hall,\r\n    J.M. M'Kim,\r\n\r\n    Nathaniel Depee,\r\n    Isaiah O.

Riley,\r\n\r\n    J.P. Burr,\r\n\r\n\r\n    Robert Purvis was understood to be Chairman of the General\r\n    Committee, having been nominated at the head of the list, and\r\n    Charles Wise was appointed treasurer. The Acting Committee was\r\n    thus constituted:\r\n\r\n    William Still, chairman, N.W. Depee, Passmore Williamson, J.C.\r\n    White. This Committee was appointed for the term of one year.\r\n\r\n    On motion, the proceedings of this meeting were ordered to be\r\n    published in the \"Pennsylvania Freeman.\"\r\n\r\n    (Adjourned.)\r\n\r\n    William Still, Secretary. Samuel Nickless, Chairman.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Committee having been thus organized, J.M. McKim, corresponding\r\nsecretary and general agent of the Pennsylvania Anti-slavery Society,\r\nissued the subjoined notice, which was published shortly afterwards in\r\nthe \"Pennsylvania Freeman,\" and the colored churches throughout the\r\ncity:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"We are pleased to see that we have at last, what has for some\r\n    time been felt to be a desideratum in Philadelphia, a\r\n    responsible and duly authorized Vigilance Committee. The duties\r\n    of this department of Anti-slavery labor, have, for want of such\r\n    an organization, been performed in a very loose and unsystematic\r\n    manner. The names of the persons constituting the Acting\r\n    Committee, are a guarantee that this will not be the case\r\n    hereafter. They are--\r\n\r\n    William Still (Chairman), 31 North Fifth Street,\r\n\r\n    Nathaniel W. Depee, 334 South Street,\r\n\r\n    Jacob C. White, 100 Old York Road, and\r\n\r\n    Passmore Williamson, southwest cor. Seventh and Arch Streets.\r\n\r\n    We respectfully commend these gentlemen, and the cause in which\r\n    they are engaged, to the confidence and co-operation of all the\r\n    friends of the hunted fugitive. Any funds contributed to either\r\n    of them, or placed in the hands of their Treasurer, Charles\r\n    Wise, corner of Fifth and Market Streets, will be sure of a\r\n    faithful and judicious appropriation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTRAITS AND SKETCHES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESTHER MOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many years no-woman living in Philadelphia was better known to the\r\ncolored people of the city generally, than Esther Moore. No woman, white\r\nor colored, living in Philadelphia for the same number of years, left\r\nher home oftener, especially to seek out and aid the weary travelers\r\nescaping from bondage, than did this philanthropist. It is hardly too\r\nmuch to say that with her own hand she administered to hundreds. She\r\nbegged of the Committee, as a special favor, that she might be duly\r\nnotified of every fugitive reaching Philadelphia, and actually felt hurt\r\nif from any cause whatever this request was not complied with. For it\r\nwas her delight to see the fugitives individually, take them by the hand\r\nand warmly welcome them to freedom. She literally wept with those who\r\nwept, while in tones of peculiar love, sincerity, and firmness, she\r\nlauded them for their noble daring, and freely expressed her entire\r\nsympathy with them, and likewise with all in the prison-house. She\r\ncondemned Slavery in all its phases, as a \"monster to be loathed as the\r\nenemy of God and man.\"\r\n\r\nOften after listening attentively for hours together to recitals of a\r\nvery harrowing nature, especially from females, her mind would seem to\r\nbe filled with the sufferings of the slave and it was hard for her to\r\nwithdraw from them even when they were on the eve of taking up their\r\nmarch for a more distant station; and she never thought of parting with\r\nthem without showing her faith by her works putting a \"gold dollar\" in\r\nthe hand of each passenger, as she knew that it was not in the power of\r\nthe Committee to do much more than defray their expenses to the next\r\nstation, to New York sometimes, to Elmira at other times, and now and\r\nthen clear through to Canada. She desired that they should have at least\r\none dollar to fall back upon, independent of the Committee's aid. This\r\nmagnanimous rule of giving the gold dollar was adopted by her shortly\r\nafter the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law, which daily vexed her\r\nrighteous soul, and was kept up as long as she was able to leave her\r\nhouse, which was within a short time of her death.\r\n\r\nNot only did Esther Moore manifest such marked interest in the fugitive\r\nbut she likewise took an abiding interest in visiting the colored people\r\nin their religious meetings, schools, and societies, and whenever the\r\nway opened and the Spirit moved her she would take occasion to address\r\nthem in the most affectionate manner, in regard to their present and\r\nfuture welfare, choosing for her theme the subjects of temperance,\r\neducation, and slavery. Nor did she mean that her labors in the interest\r\nof the oppressed should cease with her earthly existence, as the\r\nfollowing extracts from her last will and testament will prove:\r\n\r\n\r\n    2d Item. I give and bequeath to my executors, hereinafter named,\r\n    the sum of Twelve hundred dollars, in trust to invest in ground\r\n    rent, or City of Philadelphia Loans at their disposal or\r\n    discretion to pay the interest or income arising therefrom\r\n    annually. To be applied, the interest of the Twelve hundred\r\n    dollars above mentioned, for educational purposes alone, for\r\n    children of both sexes of color, in Canada, apart from all\r\n    sectarian or traditional dogmas, which is the only hope for the\r\n    rising generation. The application of this money is intended to\r\n    remain perpetual.\r\n\r\n    7th Item. I give and bequeath to my executors the sum of one\r\n    hundred dollars, to be expended by them in educating and\r\n    assisting to clothe Phaeton and Pliny J. Lock, the sons of\r\n    Ishmael Lock, deceased, and Matilda Lock (his wife). My will is\r\n    that it shall be given out discretionally by my executors for\r\n    the purpose above mentioned.\r\n\r\n    17th Item. I give and bequeath to Oliver Johnson, editor of the\r\n    Pennsylvania Freeman, one hundred dollars, if he be living at my\r\n    death; if not living, to go with the remainder of my estate. My\r\n    will is that if Oliver Johnson be not living at my death his\r\n    bequest go with my estate.\r\n\r\n    18th Item. I give and bequeath to Cyrus Burleigh, lecturer and\r\n    agent for the Pennsylvania Anti-slavery Society, one hundred\r\n    dollars, if Cyrus be living at my death. If not living at my\r\n    death, his bequest, Cyrus Burleigh's, I wish to go with the\r\n    residue of my estate. The untiring vigilance of these two young\r\n    men, in devoting the best of their days to the rescue and\r\n    emancipation of the poor and down-trodden fugitives has obtained\r\n    for them a warm place in my heart. And may heaven's richest\r\n    blessings reward them. They have ministered more than \"the cup\r\n    of water.\"\r\n\r\n    Item 19th. I give and bequeath unto the Association for the care\r\n    of Colored Orphans of Philadelphia, called the Shelter for the\r\n    use and benefit of colored orphans of both sexes, to be paid\r\n    into the hands of the treasurer for the time being, for the use\r\n    of said Society all the rest and remainder of my estate.\r\n\r\n    I wish my Executors or Trustees _to carry out_ my views in\r\n    regard to the education of colored children in Canada, by paying\r\n    over the interest arising annually from the twelve hundred\r\n    dollars mentioned in the second item to such school or schools\r\n    as in their judgment they may deem best. My desire being the\r\n    benefit of such children who may be in the same neighborhood\r\n    with them. The interest arising from the twelve hundred dollars\r\n    mentioned in second item for the purpose of educating colored\r\n    children in Canada is intended to remain perpetual.\r\n\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n    I give and bequeath to William Still, of Philadelphia, now\r\n    employed in the Anti-slavery office, in Fifth St., Philadelphia,\r\n    February 21, the sum of one hundred dollars; and request my\r\n    executors and trustees to pay over that amount out of my estate.\r\n\r\n\r\nEsther Moore was not rich in this world's goods, but was purely\r\nbenevolent and rich in good works towards her fellow-men, hating every\r\nform of oppression and injustice, and an uncompromising witness against\r\nprejudice on account of color. Such a friend as was Esther Moore during\r\nthese many dark years of kidnapping, slave-catching, mob violence, and\r\nbitter prejudice which the colored people were wont to encounter, should\r\nnever be forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe legacy devised for educational purposes was applied in due time,\r\nafter one of the executors in company with his wife, Dr. J. Wilson and\r\nRachel Barker Moore, visited the various settlements of fugitives in\r\nCanada, expressly with a view of finding out where the fund would do the\r\nmost good, in accordance with the testator's wishes. And although the\r\ntestator has been dead seventeen years, her legacy is still doing its\r\nmission in her name, in a school, near Chatham, Canada West.\r\n\r\nIn order to complete this sketch, it is only necessary that we should\r\ncopy the beautiful and just tribute to her memory, written by Oliver\r\nJohnson, editor of the \"National Anti-slavery Standard,\" and published\r\nin the columns thereof, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    DEATH OF A NOBLE WOMAN.\r\n\r\n    [From the \"National Anti-Slavery Standard.\"]\r\n\r\n    Just as our paper is going to press, there comes to us\r\n    intelligence of the death of our beloved and revered friend,\r\n    Esther Moore, widow of the late Dr. Robert Moore, of\r\n    Philadelphia. She expired on Tuesday morning, November 21st,\r\n    1854, of gout of the heart, after a short, but painful illness,\r\n    in the eightieth year of her age.\r\n\r\n    The writer of this first became acquainted with her in 1836,\r\n    and, at various times since then, has met her at Anti-slavery\r\n    meetings, or in familiar intercourse at her own house. Her most\r\n    remarkable traits of character were an intense hatred of\r\n    oppression in all its forms, a corresponding love for the\r\n    oppressed, an untiring devotion to their welfare, and a courage\r\n    that never quailed before any obstacles, however formidable. Her\r\n    zeal in behalf of the Anti-slavery cause, and especially in\r\n    behalf of the fugitive, a zeal that absorbed all the powers of\r\n    her noble nature, was a perpetual rebuke to the comparative\r\n    coldness and indifference of those around her. We well remember\r\n    how her soul was fired with a righteous indignation when upwards\r\n    of thirty innocent persons, most of them colored people, were\r\n    thrown into prison at Philadelphia, upon a charge of treason,\r\n    for their alleged participation in the tragedy at Christiana.\r\n    Day after day did she visit the prisoners in their cells, to\r\n    minister to their wants, and cheer them in their sorrow; and\r\n    during the progress of Hanway's trial, her constant presence in\r\n    the court-room, and her frequent interviews with the District\r\n    Attorney, attested her deep anxiety as to the result of the\r\n    impending struggle. When we last saw her, about a month since,\r\n    she was engaged in collecting a large sum of money to ransom a\r\n    family of slaves, whose peculiar condition had enlisted her\r\n    deepest sympathy. Notwithstanding her age and infirmities, she\r\n    had enlisted in this work with a zeal which, even in a younger\r\n    person, would have been remarkable. For many days, perhaps for\r\n    many weeks, she went from door to door, asking for the means\r\n    whereby to secure the freedom and the happiness of an enslaved\r\n    and plundered household.\r\n\r\n    As a member of the Society of Friends, she lamented the guilty\r\n    supineness of that body, in regard to the question of Slavery,\r\n    and often, in its meetings, as well as in private intercourse,\r\n    felt herself constrained to utter the language of expostulation\r\n    and rebuke. In this, as in other relations of life, she was\r\n    obedient to the revelation of God in her own soul, and a worthy\r\n    example of fidelity to her convictions of duty. Her step-son, J.\r\n    Wilson Moore, in a letter to us announcing her decease, says:\r\n\r\n    Among the last injunctions she gave, was, \"Write to Oliver\r\n    Johnson, and tell him I die firm in the faith! MIND THE SLAVE!\"\r\n    She had enjoyed excellent health the last few years, and\r\n    continued actively engaged in works of benevolence. During the\r\n    last few weeks, she had devoted much time and labor to the\r\n    collection of funds for the liberation of ten slaves in North\r\n    Carolina, who had been promised their freedom at a comparatively\r\n    small amount. Notwithstanding her great bodily suffering, her\r\n    mind was clear to the last, expressing her full assurance of\r\n    Divine approbation in the course she had taken.\r\n\r\n    This is all that we can now say of the life of our revered and\r\n    never-to-be-forgotten friend. Perhaps some one who knew her more\r\n    intimately than we did, and who is better acquainted with the\r\n    history of her life and labors, will furnish us with a more\r\n    complete sketch. If so, we shall publish it with great\r\n    satisfaction.\r\n\r\n    Happy! ay, happy! let her ashes rest; Her heart was honest, and\r\n    she did her best; In storm and darkness, evil and dismay, The\r\n    star of duty was her guiding ray.\r\n\r\n\r\nHer injunction to \"MIND THE SLAVE,\" comes to us as the dying admonition\r\nof one, whose life was a beautiful exemplification of the duty and the\r\nprivilege thus enjoined. It imposes, indeed, no new obligation; but\r\ncoming from such a source, it will linger in our memory while life and\r\nits scenes shall last, inspiring in us, we hope, a purer and a more\r\nardent devotion to the cause of freedom and humanity. And may we not\r\nhope that others also, will catch a new inspiration from the dying\r\nmessage of our departed friend: \"MIND THE SLAVE!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABIGAIL GOODWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nContemporary with Esther Moore, and likewise an intimate personal friend\r\nof hers, Abigail Goodwin, of Salem, N.J., was one of the rare, true\r\nfriends to the Underground Rail Road, whose labors entitle her name to\r\nbe mentioned in terms of very high praise.\r\n\r\nA.W.M. a most worthy lady, in a letter to a friend, refers to her in the\r\nfollowing language:\r\n\r\n\"From my long residence under the same roof, I learned to know well her\r\nuncommon self-sacrifice of character, and to be willing and glad,\r\nwhenever in my power, to honor her memory. But, yet I should not know\r\nwhat further to say about her than to give a very few words of testimony\r\nto her life of ceaseless and active benevolence, especially toward the\r\ncolored people.\r\n\r\n\"Her life outwardly was wholly uneventful; as she lived out her whole\r\nlife of seventy-three years in the neighborhood of her birth-place.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to her portrait, which was solicited for this volume, the\r\nsame lady thus writes: \"No friend of hers would for a moment think of\r\npermitting that miserable caricature, the only picture existing meant to\r\nrepresent her, to be given to the public. I cannot even bear to give a\r\nplace in my little album to so mournful and ridiculous a\r\nmisrepresentation of her in face.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You wonder why her sister, E., my loved and faithful friend, seems to\r\nbe so much less known among anti-slavery people than Abbie? One reason\r\nis, that although dear Betsy's interest in the subject was quite equal\r\nin _earnestness_, it was not quite so absorbingly _exclusive_. Betsy\r\neconomized greatly in order to give to the cause, but Abby denied\r\nherself even _necessary apparel_, and Betsy has often said that few\r\nbeggars came to our doors whose garments were so worn, forlorn, and\r\npatched-up as Abby's. Giving to the colored people was a perfect\r\n_passion_ with her; consequently she was known as a larger giver than\r\nBetsy.\r\n\r\n\"Another and greater reason why she was more known abroad than her\r\nsister E., was that she wrote with facility, and corresponded at\r\nintervals with many on these matters, Mr. McKim and others, and for many\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nAbigail was emphatically of the type of the poor widow, who cast in all\r\nher living. She worked for the slave as a mother would work for her\r\nchildren. Her highest happiness aad pleasure in life seemed to be\r\nderived from rendering acts of kindness to the oppressed. Letters of\r\nsympathy accompanied with bags of stockings, clothing, and donations of\r\nmoney were not unfrequent from her.\r\n\r\nNew Jersey contained a few well-tried friends, both within and without\r\nthe Society of Friends, to which Miss Goodwin belonged; but among them\r\nall none was found to manifest, at least in the Underground Rail Road of\r\nPhiladelphia, such an abiding interest as a co-worker in the cause, as\r\ndid Abigail Goodwin.\r\n\r\nThe sympathy which characterized her actions is clearly evinced in her\r\nown words, as contained in the appended extracts from her letter, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"DEAR FRIEND:--I sent E.M. (Esther Moore) forty-one dollars more\r\n    by half than I expected to when I set about it. I expect that\r\n    abolitionists there are all opposed to buying slaves, and will\r\n    not give anything. I don't like buying them, or giving money to\r\n    slave-holders either; but this seems to be a peculiar case, can\r\n    be had so cheap, and so many young ones that would be separated\r\n    from their parents; slavery is peculiarly hard for children,\r\n    that cannot do anything to protect themselves, nor can their\r\n    parents, and the old too, it is hard for them; but it is a\r\n    terrible thing altogether. The case of the fugitive thee\r\n    mentioned was indeed truly affecting; it makes one ashamed as\r\n    well as sad to read such things, that human beings, or any other\r\n    beings should be so treated. I cannot but hope and believe that\r\n    slavery will ere long cease. I have a strong impression that the\r\n    colored people and the women are to have a day of prosperity and\r\n    triumph over their oppressors. We must patiently wait and\r\n    quietly hope; but not keep too much 'in the quiet.' Shall have\r\n    to work our deliverance from bondage. 'Who would be free,\r\n    themselves must strike the blow.'\r\n\r\n    \"I regret very much that I have not more clothing to send than\r\n    the stockings. I have not had time since I thought of it, to\r\n    make anything; am ashamed that I was so inconsiderate of the\r\n    poor runaways. I will go to work as soon as I have earned money\r\n    to buy materials; have managed so as to spend my little annual\r\n    allowance in nine months, and shall not be able to give you any\r\n    money for some months, but if more stockings are wanted let me\r\n    know, our benevolent society have plenty on hand; and I have\r\n    some credit if not money; they will trust me till I have; they\r\n    furnish work for poor women and sell it. I get them for fifty\r\n    cents a pair.\r\n\r\n    \"My sister says Lucretia (Mott) told her that there was not much\r\n    clothing in the trunk, only a few old things. I think she told\r\n    me there was nothing in it, she meant, I suppose, of any\r\n    consequence.  *  *  *\r\n\r\n    \"I should like to know if the fugitives are mostly large. I have\r\n    an idea they are generally small in stature; that slavery stunts\r\n    the body as well as mind. I want to know in regard to the\r\n    clothes that I intend making; it's best to have them fit as well\r\n    as can be. I shall work pretty much for women. I hope and expect\r\n    there are many friends of the cause who furnish clothing in the\r\n    city. They ought to be fitted out for Canada with strong, warm\r\n    clothing in cold weather, and their sad fate alleviated as much\r\n    as can be.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe forty-one dollars, referred to in the above letter, and sent to\r\n\"E.M.\" was to go especially towards buying an interesting family of ten\r\nslaves, who were owned in North Carolina by a slave-holder, whose rare\r\nliberality was signalized by offering to take $1,000 for the lot, young\r\nand old. In this exceptional case, while opposed to buying slaves, in\r\ncommon with abolitionists generally, she was too tender-hearted to\r\nresist the temptation so long as \"they could be bought so cheap.\"\r\n\r\nTo rid men of their yoke was her chief desire. Such was her habit of\r\nmaking the sad lot of a slave a personal matter; that let her view him,\r\nin any light whatever, whether in relation to young ones that would be\r\nseparated from their parents, or with regard to the old, the life of a\r\nslave was \"peculiarly hard,\" \"a terrible thing\" in her judgment.\r\n\r\nThe longer she lived, and the more faithfully she labored for the\r\nslave's deliverance, the more firmly she became rooted in the\r\nsoul-encouraging idea, that \"Slavery will ere long cease.\" Whilst the\r\ngreat masses were either blind, or indifferent, she was nerved by this\r\nfaith to bear cheerfully all the sacrifices she was called on to make.\r\nFrom another letter we copy as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    JANUARY 25th, 1855.\r\n\r\n    DEAR FRIEND:--The enclosed ten dollars I have made, earned in\r\n    two weeks, and of course it belongs to the slave. It may go for\r\n    the fugitives, or Carolina slaves, whichever needs it most. I am\r\n    sorry the fugitives' treasury is not better supplied, if money\r\n    could flow into it as it does into the Tract Fund; but that is\r\n    not to be expected.\r\n\r\n    Thy answer in regard to impostors is quite satisfactory. No\r\n    doubt you take great pains to arrive at the truth, but cannot at\r\n    all times avoid being imposed on. Will that little boy of seven\r\n    years have to travel on foot to Canada? There will be no safety\r\n    for him here. I hope his father will get off. John Hill writes\r\n    very well, considering his few advantages. If plenty of good\r\n    schools could be established in Canada for the benefit of\r\n    fugitives, many bright scholars and useful citizens would be\r\n    added to society. I hope these will be in process of time.\r\n\r\n    It takes the most energetic and intelligent to make their way\r\n    out of bondage from the most Southern States. It is rather a\r\n    wonder to me that so many can escape, the masters are so\r\n    continually watching them. The poor man that secreted himself so\r\n    long, must, indeed, have suffered dreadfully, and been\r\n    exceedingly resolute to brave dangers so long.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was so characteristic of her to take an interest in everything that\r\npertained to the Underground Rail Road, that even the deliverance of a\r\nlittle nameless boy was not beneath her notice. To her mind, his freedom\r\nwas just as dear to him as if he had been the son of the President of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nHow they got on in Canada, and the question of education, were matters\r\nthat concerned her deeply; hence, occasional letters received from\r\nCanada, evincing marked progress, such as the hero John H. Hill was in\r\nthe habit of writing, always gave her much pleasure to peruse.\r\n\r\nIn the Wheeler slave-case, in which Passmore Williamson and others were\r\nengaged, her interest was very great. From a letter dated Salem,\r\nSeptember 9, 1855, we quote the subjoined extract:\r\n\r\n\r\n    DEAR FRIEND:--I am truly rejoiced and thankful that the right\r\n    has triumphed. But stranger had it been otherwise, in your\r\n    intelligent community, where it must be apparent to all who\r\n    inquire into it, that you had done nothing but what was\r\n    deserving of high commendation, instead of blame and punishment;\r\n    and shame on the jury who would bring in the two men guilty of\r\n    assault and battery. They ought to have another trial; perhaps\r\n    another jury would be more just. It is well for the credit of\r\n    Philadelphia, that there is one upright judge, as Kelley seems\r\n    to be, and his sentence will be a light one it is presumed,\r\n    showing he considered the charge a mere pretence.\r\n\r\n    I hope and trust, that neither thyself nor the other men will\r\n    have much if any of the expense to bear; your lawyers will not\r\n    charge anything I suppose, and the good citizens will pay all\r\n    else. It seems there are hopes entertained that Passmore\r\n    Williamson will soon be set at liberty. It must be a great\r\n    comfort to him and wife, in their trials, that it will conduce\r\n    to the furtherance of the good cause.\r\n\r\n    If Philadelphians are not aroused now after this great stretch\r\n    of power, to consider their safety, they must be a stupid set of\r\n    people, but it must certainly do good.  *  *  *  You will take\r\n    good care of Jane Johnson, I hope, and not let her get kidnapped\r\n    back to Slavery. Is it safe for her to remain in your city or\r\n    anywhere else in our \"free land?\" I have some doubts and fears\r\n    for her; do try to impress her with the necessity of being very\r\n    cautious and careful against deceivers, pretended friends. She\r\n    had better be off to Canada pretty soon.\r\n\r\n    Thy wife must not sit up washing and ironing all night again.\r\n    She ought to have help in her sympathy and labors for the poor\r\n    fugitives, and, I should think there are many there who would\r\n    willingly assist her.\r\n\r\n    I intended to be careful of trespassing upon thy time, as thee\r\n    must have enough to do; the fugitives are still coming I expect.\r\n    With kind regards, also to thy wife, your friend,\r\n\r\n    A. GOODWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn another letter, she suggests the idea of getting up a committee of\r\nwomen to provide clothing for fugitive females; on this point she wrote\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"SALEM, 8th mo., 1st.\r\n\r\n    \"Would it not be well to get up a committee of women, to provide\r\n    clothes for fugitive females--a dozen women sewing a day, or\r\n    even half a day of each week, might keep a supply always ready,\r\n    they might, I should think, get the merchants or some of them,\r\n    to give cheap materials--mention it to thy wife, and see if she\r\n    cannot get up a society. I will do what I can here for it. I\r\n    enclose five dollars for the use of fugitives. It was a good\r\n    while that I heard nothing of your rail road concerns; I\r\n    expected thee had gone to Canada, or has the journey not been\r\n    made, or is it yet to be accomplished, or given up? I was in\r\n    hopes thee would go and see with thy own eyes, how things go on\r\n    in that region of fugitives, and if it's a goodly land to live\r\n    in.\r\n\r\n    \"This is the first of August, and I suppose you are celebrating\r\n    it in Philadelphia, or some of you are, though I believe you are\r\n    not quite as zealous as the Bostonians are in doing it. When\r\n    will our first of August come? oh, that it might be soon, very\r\n    soon! ... It's high time the 'reign of oppression was over.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEver alive to the work, she would appeal to such as were able among her\r\nfriends, to take stock in the Underground Rail Road, and would sometimes\r\nsucceed. In a letter dated July 30, 1856, she thus alludes to her\r\nefforts:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I have tried to beg something for them, but have not got much;\r\n    one of our neighbors, S.W. Acton, gave me three dollars for\r\n    them; I added enough to make ten, which thee will find inside. I\r\n    shall owe three more, to make my ten. I presume they are still\r\n    coming every day almost, and I fear it comes rather hard on thee\r\n    and wife to do for so many; but you no doubt feel it a\r\n    satisfaction to do all you can for the poor sufferers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary 10, 1858, she forwarded her willing contribution, with the\r\nfollowing interesting remarks:\r\n\r\n\r\n    SALEM, February 10, 1858.\r\n\r\n    DEAR FRIEND:--Thee will find enclosed, five dollars for the\r\n    fugitives, a little for so many to share it, but better than\r\n    nothing; oh, that people, rich people, would remember them\r\n    instead of spending so much on themselves; and those too, who\r\n    are not called rich, might, if there was only a willing mind,\r\n    give too of their abundance; how can they forbear to sympathize\r\n    with those poor destitute ones--but so it is--there is not half\r\n    the feeling for them there ought to be, indeed scarcely anybody\r\n    seems to think about them. \"Inasmuch as ye have _not_ done it\r\n    unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have not done it\r\n    unto me.\"\r\n\r\n    Thy friend,\r\n\r\n    A. GOODWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the long looked-for day of emancipation arrived, which she had\r\nnever expected to witness, the unbounded thankfulness of her heart found\r\nexpression in the appended letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n    SALEM, September 23, 1862.\r\n\r\n    DEAR FRIEND:--Thy letter dated 17th, was not received till last\r\n    night. I cannot tell where it has been detained so long. On the\r\n    22d, yesterday, Amy Reckless came here, after I began writing,\r\n    and wished me to defer sending for a day or two, thinking she\r\n    could get a few more dollars, and she has just brought some, and\r\n    will try for more, and clothing. A thousand thanks to President\r\n    Hamlin for his kindness to the contrabands; poor people! how\r\n    deplorable their situation; where will they go to, when cold\r\n    weather comes? so many of them to find homes for, but they must\r\n    and will, I trust be taken care of, not by their former\r\n    care-takers though.\r\n\r\n    I have read the President's proclamation of emancipation, with\r\n    thankfulness and rejoicing; but upon a little reflection, I did\r\n    not feel quite satisfied with it; three months seems a long time\r\n    to be in the power of their angry and cruel masters, who, no\r\n    doubt, will wreak all their fury and vengeance upon them,\r\n    killing and abusing them in every way they can--and sell them to\r\n    Cuba if they can. It makes me sad to think of it. Slavery, I\r\n    fear, will be a long time in dying, after receiving the fatal\r\n    stroke. What do abolitionists think of it? and what is thy\r\n    opinion? I feel quite anxious to know something more about it.\r\n    The \"Daily Press\" says, it will end the war and its cause. How\r\n    can we be thankful enough if it should, and soon too. \"Oh,\r\n    praise and tanks,\" what a blessing for our country. I never\r\n    expected to see the happy day. If thee answers this, thee will\r\n    please tell me all about it, and what is thought of it by the\r\n    wise ones; but I ought not to intrude on thy time, thee has so\r\n    much on thy hands, nor ask thee to write. I shall know in time,\r\n    if I can be patient to wait.\r\n\r\n    Enclosed are seventeen dollars; from Amy Reckless, $1,50; J.\r\n    Bassett, $1; Jesse Bond, $1; Martha Reeve, $1; S. Woodnutt, $1;\r\n    Hannah Wheeler, $1; a colored man, 25 cents; 25 cents thrown in,\r\n    to make even; A.G., $10. Amy is very good in helping, and is\r\n    collecting clothing, which she thinks, cannot be sent till next\r\n    week. I will attend to sending it, as soon as can be, by stage\r\n    driver. May every success attend thy labors for the poor\r\n    sufferers.  *  *  *\r\n\r\n    With kind regards, thy friend,\r\n\r\n    A. GOODWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, until the last fetter was broken, with singular persistency, zeal,\r\nfaith and labor, she did what she could to aid the slave, without hope\r\nof reward in this world. Not only did she contribute to aid the\r\nfugitives, but was, for years, a regular and liberal contributor to the\r\nPennsylvania Anti-slavery Society, as well as a subscriber to the\r\nAnti-slavery papers, The \"Liberator,\" \"National Anti-Slavery Standard,\"\r\n\"Pennsylvania Freeman,\" etc.\r\n\r\nHaving seen with joy, the desire of her heart, in the final emancipation\r\nof every bondman in the United States, she departed in peace, November\r\n2, 1867, in the 74th year of her age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAITHFUL WORKERS IN THE CAUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ABIGAIL GOODWIN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS GARRETT,]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DANIEL GIBBONS, ]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LUCRETIA MOTT]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recent death of Thomas Garrett, called forth from the press, as well\r\nas from abolitionists and personal friends, such universal expressions\r\nof respect for his labors as a philanthropist, and especially as an\r\nunswerving friend of the Underground Rail Road, that we need only\r\nreproduce selections therefrom, in order to commemorate his noble deeds\r\nin these pages.\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Wilmington Daily Commercial,\" published by Jenkins and\r\nAtkinson (men fully inspired with the spirit of impartial freedom), we\r\ncopy the following notice, which is regarded by his relatives and\r\nintimate anti-slavery friends as a faithful portraiture of his character\r\nand labors:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Thomas Garrett, who died full of years and honor, this morning,\r\n    at the ripe age of eighty-one, was a man of no common character.\r\n    He was an abolitionist from his youth up, and though the grand\r\n    old cause numbered amongst its supporters, poets, sages, and\r\n    statesmen, it had no more faithful worker in its ranks than\r\n    Thomas Garrett.\r\n\r\n    He has been suffering for several years, from a disease of the\r\n    bladder, which frequently caused him most acute anguish, and\r\n    several times threatened his life. The severe pain attending the\r\n    disease, and the frequent surgical operations it rendered\r\n    necessary, undermined his naturally strong constitution, so that\r\n    when he was prostrated by his last illness, grave fears were\r\n    entertained of a fatal result. He continued in the possession of\r\n    his faculties to the last, and frequently expressed his entire\r\n    willingness to die.\r\n\r\n    Yesterday he was found to be sinking very rapidly. Just before\r\n    midnight, last night, he commenced to speak, and some of those\r\n    in attendance, went close to his bed-side. He was evidently in\r\n    some pain, and said: \"It is all peace, peace, peace, but no rest\r\n    this side of the river.\" He then breathed calmly on for some\r\n    time. About half an hour later, one of those in attendance\r\n    ceased to hear his breathing, and bending over him, found that\r\n    his soul had fled.\r\n\r\n    He retained a good deal of his strength through his illness, and\r\n    was able to get up from his bed, every day, with the assistance\r\n    of one person.\r\n\r\n    He will be buried in the Friends' grave-yard, corner of Fourth\r\n    and West Streets, on Saturday next, at three o'clock, P.M., and\r\n    in accordance with a written memorandum of an agreement made by\r\n    him a year ago with them, the colored people will bear him to\r\n    his grave, they having solicited of him that honor.\r\n\r\n    He was born of Quaker parents, in Upper Darby, Delaware county,\r\n    Pa., on the 21st of August, 1789, on a farm still in the\r\n    possession of the family. His father, though a farmer, had been\r\n    a scythe and edge-tool maker, and Thomas learned of him the\r\n    trade, and his knowledge of it afterwards proved of the utmost\r\n    advantage to him.\r\n\r\n    He grew up and married at Darby, his wife being Sarah Sharpless,\r\n    and in 1820 they came to Wilmington to live, bringing with them\r\n    several children, most of whom still live here.\r\n\r\n    Some years after his arrival here, his wife died, and in course\r\n    of time, he again married, his second wife being Rachel\r\n    Mendenhall, who died in April, 1868, beloved and regretted by\r\n    all who knew her.\r\n\r\n    His business career was one of vicissitude, but generally and\r\n    ultimately successful, for he made the whole of the comfortable\r\n    competence of which he died possessed, after he was sixty years\r\n    of age. While in the beginning of his business career, as an\r\n    iron merchant in this city, a wealthy rival house attempted to\r\n    crush him, by reducing prices of iron to cost, but Mr. Garrett,\r\n    nothing dismayed, employed another person to attend his store,\r\n    put on his leather apron, took to his anvil, and in the\r\n    prosecution of his trade, as an edge-tool maker, prepared to\r\n    support himself as long as this ruinous rivalry was kept up.\r\n    Thus in the sweat of the brow of one of the heroes and\r\n    philanthropists of this age, was laid the foundation of one of\r\n    the most extensive business houses that our city now boasts. His\r\n    competitor saw that no amount of rivalry could crush a man thus\r\n    self-supporting and gave up the effort.\r\n\r\n    Of course, Thomas Garrett is best known for his labors in behalf\r\n    of the abolition of Slavery, and as a practical and effective\r\n    worker for emancipation long before the nation commenced the\r\n    work of liberation and justice.\r\n\r\n    Born a Quaker, he held with simple trust, the faith of the\r\n    society that God moves and inspires men to do the work he\r\n    requires of their hands, and throughout his life he never\r\n    wavered in his conviction, that his Father had called him to\r\n    work in the cause to which he devoted himself.\r\n\r\n    His attention was first directed to the iniquity of Slavery,\r\n    while he was a young man of twenty-four or twenty five. He\r\n    returned one day to his father's house, after a brief absence,\r\n    and found the family dismayed and indignant at the kidnapping of\r\n    a colored woman in their employ.\r\n\r\n    Thomas immediately resolved to follow the kidnappers, and so\r\n    started in pursuit. Some peculiarity about the track made by\r\n    their wagon, enabled him to trace them with ease, and he\r\n    followed them by a devious course, from Darby, to a place near\r\n    the Navy Yard, in Philadelphia, and then by inquiries, etc.,\r\n    tracked them to Kensington, where he found them, and, we\r\n    believe, secured the woman's release.\r\n\r\n    During this ride, he afterwards assured his friends, he felt the\r\n    iniquity and abomination of the whole system of Slavery borne in\r\n    upon his mind so strongly, as to fairly appal him, and he seemed\r\n    to hear a voice within him, assuring him that his work in life\r\n    must be to help and defend this persecuted race.\r\n\r\n    From this time forward, he never failed to assist any fugitive\r\n    from Slavery on the way to freedom, and, of course, after his\r\n    removal to this city, his opportunities for this were greatly\r\n    increased, and in course of time, his house became known as one\r\n    of the refuges for fugitives. The sentiment of this community\r\n    was, at that time, bitterly averse to any word or effort against\r\n    Slavery, and Mr. Garrett had but half a dozen friends who stood\r\n    by him. Nearly all others looked at him with suspicion, or\r\n    positive aversion, and his house was constantly under the\r\n    surveillance of the police, who then, sad to say, were always on\r\n    the watch for any fugitives from bondage. Thomas was not\r\n    disheartened or dismayed by the lack of popular sympathy or\r\n    approval. He believed the Lord was on his side, and cared\r\n    nothing for the adverse opinion of men.\r\n\r\n    Many and interesting stories are told of the men and women he\r\n    helped away, some of them full of pathos, and some decidedly\r\n    amusing. He told the latter which related to his ingenious\r\n    contrivances for assisting fugitives to escape the police with\r\n    much pleasure, in his later years. We would repeat many of them,\r\n    but this is not the time or place. The necessity of avoiding the\r\n    police was the only thing, however, which ever forced him into\r\n    any secrecy in his operations, and in all other respects he was\r\n    \"without concealment and without compromise\" in his opposition\r\n    to Slavery. He was a man of unusual personal bravery, and of\r\n    powerful physique, and did not present an encouraging object for\r\n    the bullying intimidation by which the pro-slavery men of that\r\n    day generally overawed their opponents. He seems to have\r\n    scarcely known what fear was, and though irate slave-holders\r\n    often called on him to learn the whereabouts of their slaves, he\r\n    met them placidly, never denied having helped the fugitives on\r\n    their way, positively refused to give them any information, and\r\n    when they flourished pistols, or bowie-knives to enforce their\r\n    demands, he calmly pushed the weapons aside, and told them that\r\n    none but cowards resorted to such means to carry their ends.\r\n\r\n    He continued his labors, thus, for years, helping all who came\r\n    to him, and making no concealment of his readiness to do so. His\r\n    firmness and courage slowly won others, first to admire, and\r\n    then to assist him, and the little band of faithful workers, of\r\n    which he was chief, gradually enlarged and included in its\r\n    number, men of all ranks, and differing creeds, and, singular as\r\n    it may seem, even numbering some ardent Democrats in its ranks.\r\n    He has, in conversation with the present writer and others,\r\n    frequently acknowledged the valuable services of two Roman\r\n    Catholics, of Irish birth, still living in this city, who were\r\n    ever faithful to him, and will now be amongst those who most\r\n    earnestly mourn his decease.\r\n\r\n    His efforts, of course, brought him much persecution and\r\n    annoyance, but never culminated in anything really serious,\r\n    until about the year 1846 or '47.\r\n\r\n    He then met, at New Castle, a man, woman, and six children, from\r\n    down on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. The man was free, the\r\n    woman had, been a slave, and while in Slavery had had by her\r\n    husband, two children. She was then set free, and afterwards had\r\n    four children. The whole party ran away. They traveled several\r\n    days, and finally reached Middletown, late at night, where they\r\n    were taken in, fed and cared for, by John Hunn, a wealthy\r\n    Quaker, there. They were watched, however, by some persons in\r\n    that section, who followed them, arrested them, and sent them to\r\n    New Castle to jail. The sheriff and his daughter were\r\n    Anti-slavery people, and wrote to Mr. Garrett to come over. He\r\n    went over, had an interview, found from their statement, that\r\n    four of the party were undoubtedly free, and returned to this\r\n    city. On the following day, he and U.S. Senator Wales, went over\r\n    and had the party taken before Judge Booth, on a writ of _habeas\r\n    corpus_. Judge Booth decided that there was no evidence on which\r\n    to hold them, that in the absence of evidence the _presumption\r\n    was always in favor of freedom_ and discharged them.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Garrett then said, here is this woman with a babe at her\r\n    breast, the child suffering from a white swelling on its leg, is\r\n    there any impropriety in my getting a carriage and helping them\r\n    over to Wilmington? Judge Booth responded certainly not.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Garrett then hired the carriage, but gave the driver\r\n    distinctly to understand that he only paid for the woman and the\r\n    young children; the rest might walk. They all got in, however,\r\n    and finally escaped, of course the two children born in slavery\r\n    amongst the rest.\r\n\r\n    Six weeks afterwards the slave-holders followed them, and\r\n    incited, it is said, by the Cochrans and James A. Bayard,\r\n    commenced a suit against Mr. Garrett, claiming all the fugitives\r\n    as slaves. Mr. Garrett's friends claim that the jury was packed\r\n    to secure an adverse verdict. The trial came on before Chief\r\n    Justice Taney and Judge Hall, in the May term (1848) of the U.S.\r\n    Court, sitting at New Castle, Bayard representing the\r\n    prosecutors, and Wales the defendant. There were four trials in\r\n    all, lasting three days. We have not room here for the details\r\n    of the trial, but the juries awarded even heavier damages than\r\n    the plaintiffs claimed, and the judgments swept away every\r\n    dollar of his property.\r\n\r\n    When the trials were concluded, Mr. Garrett arose, the court\r\n    being adjourned, made a speech of an hour to the large crowd in\r\n    the court-room, in the course of which he declared his intention\r\n    to redouble his exertions, so help him God. His bold assertion\r\n    was greeted with mingled cheers and hisses, and at the\r\n    conclusion of his speech one of the jurors who had convicted him\r\n    strode across the benches, grasped his hand, and begged his\r\n    forgivenness.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Garrett kept his pledge and redoubled his exertions. The\r\n    trial advertised him, and such was the demand on him for\r\n    shelter, that he was compelled to put another story on his back\r\n    buildings. His friends helped him to start again in business,\r\n    and commencing anew in his sixtieth year with nothing, he again\r\n    amassed a handsome competence, generously contributing all the\r\n    while to every work in behalf of the down-trodden blacks or his\r\n    suffering fellow-men of any color.\r\n\r\n    In time the war came, and as he remarked, the nation went into\r\n    the business by the wholesale, so he quit his retail operations,\r\n    having, after he commenced to keep a record, helped off over\r\n    twenty-one hundred slaves, and no inconsiderable number before\r\n    that time.\r\n\r\n    In time, too, he came to be honored instead of execrated for his\r\n    noble efforts. Wilmington became an abolition city, and for\r\n    once, at least, a prophet was not without honor in his own city.\r\n    Mr. Garrett continued his interest in every reform up to his\r\n    last illness, and probably his last appearance in any public\r\n    capacity, was as president of a Woman Suffrage meeting, in the\r\n    City Hall, a few months ago, which was addressed by Julia Ward\r\n    Howe, Lucy Stone, and Henry B. Blackwell.\r\n\r\n    He lived to see the realization of his hopes for Universal\r\n    Freedom, and in April last on the occasion of the great parade\r\n    of the colored people in this city, he was carried through our\r\n    streets in an open barouche, surrounded by the men in whose\r\n    behalf he had labored so faithfully, and the guards around his\r\n    carriage carrying banners, with the inscription, \"Our Moses.\"\r\n\r\n    A Moses he was to their race; but unto him it was given to enter\r\n    into the promised land toward which he had set his face\r\n    persistently and almost alone for more than half a century.\r\n\r\n    He was beloved almost to adoration by his dusky-hued friends,\r\n    and in the dark days of the beginning of the war, which every\r\n    Wilmingtonian will remember with a shudder, in those days of\r\n    doubt, confusion, and suspicion, without his knowledge or\r\n    consent, Thomas Garrett's house was constantly surrounded and\r\n    watched by faithful black men, resolved that, come weal come woe\r\n    to them, no harm should come to the benefactor of their race.\r\n\r\n    He was a hero in a life-time fight, an upright, honest man in\r\n    his dealings with men, a tender husband, a loving father, and\r\n    above all, a man who loved his neighbor as himself, and\r\n    righteousness and truth better than ease, safety, or worldly\r\n    goods, and who never let any fear of harm to person or property\r\n    sway him from doing his whole duty to the uttermost.\r\n\r\n    He was faithful among the faithless, upright and just in the\r\n    midst of a wicked and perverse generation, and lived to see his\r\n    labors rewarded and approved in his own life-time, and then with\r\n    joy that the Right had triumphed by mightier means than his own;\r\n    with thankfulness for the past, and with calm trust for the\r\n    future, he passed to the reward of the just. He has fought a\r\n    good fight, he has finished his course, he has kept the faith.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the same paper, of January 30th, 1871, we extract an account of the\r\nfuneral obsequies which took place on Saturday, January 28th.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FUNERAL SERVICE ON SATURDAY.\r\n\r\n    The funeral of Thomas Garrett, which took place on Saturday,\r\n    partook almost of the character of a popular ovation to the\r\n    memory of the deceased, though it was conducted with the\r\n    plainness of form which characterizes the society of which he\r\n    was a member.\r\n\r\n    There was no display, no organization, nothing whatever to\r\n    distinguish this from ordinary funerals, except the outpouring\r\n    of people of every creed, condition, and color, to follow the\r\n    remains to their last resting-place.\r\n\r\n    There was for an hour or two before the procession started, a\r\n    constant living stream of humanity passing into the house,\r\n    around the coffin, and out at another door, to take a last look\r\n    at the face of the deceased, the features of which displayed a\r\n    sweetness and serenity which occasioned general remark. A smile\r\n    seemed to play upon the dead lips.\r\n\r\n    Shortly after three o'clock the funeral procession started, the\r\n    plain coffin, containing the remains, being carried by the\r\n    stalwart arms of a delegation of colored men, and the family and\r\n    friends of the deceased following in carriages with a large\r\n    procession on foot, while the sidewalks along the line, from the\r\n    house to the meeting-house, more than six squares, were densely\r\n    crowded with spectators.\r\n\r\n    The Friends' Meeting House was already crowded, except the place\r\n    reserved for the relatives of the deceased, and, though probably\r\n    fifteen hundred people crowded into the capacious building, a\r\n    greater number still were unable to gain admission.\r\n\r\n    The crowd inside was composed of all kinds and conditions of\r\n    men, white and black, all uniting to do honor to the character\r\n    and works of the deceased.\r\n\r\n    The coffin was laid in the open space in front of the gallery of\r\n    ministers and elders, and the lid removed from it, after which\r\n    there was a period of silence.\r\n\r\n    Presently the venerable Lucretia Mott arose and said that,\r\n    seeing the gathering of the multitude there and thronging along\r\n    the streets, as she had passed on her way to the meeting-house,\r\n    she had thought of the multitude which gathered after the death\r\n    of Jesus, and of the remark of the Centurion, who, seeing the\r\n    people, said: \"Certainly this was a righteous man.\" Looking at\r\n    this multitude she would say surely this also was a righteous\r\n    man. She was not one of those who thought it best always on\r\n    occasions like this, to speak in eulogy of the dead, but this\r\n    was not an ordinary case, and seeing the crowd that had\r\n    gathered, and amongst it the large numbers of a once despised\r\n    and persecuted race, for which the deceased had done so much,\r\n    she felt that it was fit and proper that the good deeds of this\r\n    man's life should be remembered, for the encouragement of\r\n    others. She spoke of her long acquaintance with him, of his\r\n    cheerful and sunny disposition, and his firm devotion to the\r\n    truth as he saw it.\r\n\r\n    Aaron M. Powell, of New York, was the next speaker, and he spoke\r\n    at length with great earnestness of the life-long labor of his\r\n    departed friend in the abolition cause, of his cheerfulness, his\r\n    courage, and his perfect consecration to his work.\r\n\r\n    He alluded to the fact, that deceased was a member of the\r\n    Society of Friends, and held firmly to its faith that God leads\r\n    and inspires men to do the work He requires of them, that He\r\n    speaks within the soul of every man, and that all men are\r\n    equally His children, subject to His guidance, and that all\r\n    should be free to follow wherever the Spirit might lead. It was\r\n    Thomas Garrett's recognition of this sentiment that made him an\r\n    abolitionist, and inspired him with the courage to pursue his\r\n    great work. He cared little for the minor details of Quakerism,\r\n    but he was a true Quaker in his devotion to this great central\r\n    idea which is the basis on which it rests. He urged the Society\r\n    to take a lesson from the deceased, and recognizing the\r\n    responsibility of their position, to labor with earnestness, and\r\n    to consecrate their whole beings to the cause of right and\r\n    reform. It is impossible for us to give any fair abstract of Mr.\r\n    Powell's earnest and eloquent tribute to his friend, on whom he\r\n    had looked, he said, as \"a Father in Israel\" from his boyhood.\r\n\r\n    William Howard Day, then came forward, saying, he understood\r\n    that it would not be considered inappropriate for one of his\r\n    race to say a few words on this occasion, and make some attempt\r\n    to pay a fitting tribute to one to whom they owed so much. He\r\n    did not feel to-day like paying such a tribute, his grief was\r\n    too fresh upon him, his heart too bowed down, and he could do no\r\n    more, than in behalf of his race, not only those here, but the\r\n    host the deceased has befriended, and of the whole four millions\r\n    to whom he had been so true a friend, cast a tribute of praise\r\n    and thanks upon his grave.\r\n\r\n    Rev. Alfred Cookman, of Grace M.E. Church, next arose, and said\r\n    that he came there intending to say nothing, but the scene moved\r\n    him to a few words. He remembered once standing in front of St.\r\n    Paul's Cathedral, in London, and seeing therein the name of the\r\n    architect, Sir Christopher Wren, inscribed, and under it this\r\n    inscription: \"Stranger, if you would see his monument look about\r\n    you.\" And the thought came to him that if you would see the\r\n    monument of him who lies there, look about you and see it built\r\n    in stones of living hearts. He thanked God for the works of this\r\n    man; he thanked Him especially for his noble character. He said\r\n    that he felt that that body had been the temple of a noble\r\n    spirit, aye the temple of God himself, and some day they would\r\n    meet the spirit in the heavenly land beyond the grave.\r\n\r\n    Lucretia Mott arose, and said she feared the claim might appear\r\n    to be made that Quakerism alone held the great central principle\r\n    which dominated this man's life; but she wished it understood\r\n    that they recognized this \"voice within\" as leading and guiding\r\n    all men, and they probably meant by it much the same as those\r\n    differing from them meant by the Third person in their Trinity.\r\n    She did not wish, even in appearance, to claim a belief in this\r\n    voice for her own sect alone.\r\n\r\n    T. Clarkson Taylor then said, that the time for closing the\r\n    services had arrived, and in a very few words commended the\r\n    lesson of his life to those present, after which the meeting\r\n    dissolved, and the body was carried to the grave-yard in the\r\n    rear of the meeting-house, and deposited in its last\r\n    resting-place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIAL OF THE CASES, 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    To the Editor of the Commercial:\r\n\r\n    Your admirable and interesting sketch of the career of the late\r\n    Thomas Garrett contains one or two statements, which, according\r\n    to my recollection of the facts, are not entirely accurate, and\r\n    are perhaps of sufficient importance to be corrected.\r\n\r\n    The proceedings in the U.S. Circuit Court were not public\r\n    prosecutions or indictments, but civil suits instituted by the\r\n    owners of the runaway slaves, who employed and paid counsel to\r\n    conduct them. An act of Congress, then in force, imposed a\r\n    penalty of five hundred dollars on any person who should\r\n    knowingly harbor or conceal a fugitive from labor, to be\r\n    recovered by and for the benefit of the claimant of such\r\n    fugitive, in any Court proper to try the same; saving, moreover,\r\n    to the claimant his right of action for or on account of loss,\r\n    etc.; thus giving to the slave-owner two cases for action for\r\n    each fugitive, one of debt for the penalty, and one of trespass\r\n    for damages.\r\n\r\n    There were in all seven slaves, only the husband and father of\r\n    the family being free, who escaped under the friendly help and\r\n    guidance of Mr. Garrett, five of whom were claimed by E.N.\r\n    Turner, and the remaining two by C.T. Glanding, both claimants\r\n    being residents of Maryland.\r\n\r\n    In the suits for the penalties, Turner obtained judgment for\r\n    twenty-five hundred dollars, and Glanding, one for one thousand\r\n    dollars. In these cases the jury could give neither less nor\r\n    more than the amount of the penalties, on the proper proof being\r\n    made. Nor in the trespass case did the jury give \"larger damages\r\n    than were claimed.\" A jury sometimes does queer things, but it\r\n    cannot make a verdict for a greater sum than the plaintiff\r\n    demands; in the trespass cases, Glanding had a verdict for one\r\n    thousand dollars damages, but in Turner's case only nine hundred\r\n    dollars were allowed, though the plaintiff sued for twenty-five\r\n    hundred.\r\n\r\n    It is hardly true to say that any one of the juries was\r\n    _packed_, indeed, it would have been a difficult matter in that\r\n    day for the Marshal to summon thirty sober, honest, and\r\n    judicious men, fairly and impartially chosen from the three\r\n    counties of Delaware, who would have found verdicts different\r\n    from those which were rendered. The jury must have been fixed\r\n    for the defendant to have secured any other result, on the\r\n    supposition that the testimony admitted of any doubt or\r\n    question, the anti-slavery men in the state being like Virgil's\r\n    ship-wrecked mariners, very few in number and scattered over a\r\n    vast space.\r\n\r\n    What most redounds to the honor and praise of Mr. Garrett, in\r\n    this transaction, as a noble and disinterested philanthropist\r\n    is, that after the fugitives had been discharged from custody\r\n    under the writ of _habeas corpus_, and when he had been advised\r\n    by his lawyer, who was also his personal friend, to keep his\r\n    hands off and let the party work their own passage to a haven of\r\n    freedom, not then far distant, or he might be involved in\r\n    serious trouble, he deliberately refused to abandon them to the\r\n    danger of pursuit and capture. The welfare and happiness of too\r\n    many human beings were at stake to permit him to think of\r\n    personal consequences, and he was ready and dared to encounter\r\n    any risk for himself, so that he could insure the safety of\r\n    those fleeing from bondage. It was this heroic purpose to\r\n    protect the weak and helpless at any cost, this fearless\r\n    unselfish action, not stopping to weigh the contingencies of\r\n    individual gain or loss, that constitutes his best title to the\r\n    gratitude of those he served, and to the admiration and respect\r\n    of all who can appreciate independent conduct springing from\r\n    pure and lofty motives. He did what he thought and believed to\r\n    be right, and let the consequences take care of themselves. He\r\n    never would directly or otherwise, entice a slave to leave his\r\n    master; but he never would refuse his aid to the hunted, panting\r\n    wretch that in the pursuit of happiness was seeking after\r\n    liberty. And who among us is now bold enough to say, that in all\r\n    this he did not see clearly, act bravely, do justly, and live up\r\n    to the spirit of the sacred text:--\"Whatsoever ye would that men\r\n    should do to you, do ye even so to them?\"\r\n\r\n    W.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a letter addressed to one of the sons, William Lloyd Garrison pays\r\nthe following beautiful and just tribute to his faithfulness in the\r\ncause of freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BOSTON, January 25th, 1871.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR FRIEND:--I have received the intelligence of the death\r\n    of your honored and revered father, with profound emotions. If\r\n    it were not for the inclemency of the weather, and the delicate\r\n    state of my health, I would hasten to be at the funeral, long as\r\n    the distance is; not indeed as a mourner, for, in view of his\r\n    ripe old age, and singularly beneficent life, there is no cause\r\n    for sorrow, but to express the estimation in which I held him,\r\n    as one of the best men who ever walked the earth, and one of the\r\n    most beloved among my numerous friends and co-workers in the\r\n    cause of an oppressed and down-trodden race, now happily\r\n    rejoicing in their heavenly-wrought deliverance. For to no one\r\n    was the language of Job more strictly applicable than to\r\n    himself:--\"When the ear heard me, then it blessed me, and when\r\n    the eye saw me, it gave witness to me; because I delivered the\r\n    poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to\r\n    help him. The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon\r\n    me; and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. I put on\r\n    righteousness, and it clothed me; my judgment was as a robe and\r\n    a diadem. I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame. I\r\n    was a father to the poor; and the cause which I knew not I\r\n    searched out. And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked\r\n    the spoil out of his teeth.\" This is an exact portraiture of\r\n    your father, a most comprehensive delineation of his character\r\n    as a philanthropist and reformer. It was his meat and drink.\r\n\r\n      \"The poor to feed, the lost to seek,\r\n        To proffer life to death,\r\n      Hope to the erring, to the weak\r\n        The strength of his own faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n      \"To plead the captive's right; remove\r\n        The sting of hate from law;\r\n      And soften in the fire of love\r\n        The hardened steel of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n      \"He walked the dark world in the mild,\r\n        Still guidance of the light;\r\n      In tearful tenderness a child,\r\n        A strong man in the right.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    Did there ever live one who had less of that \"fear of man which\r\n    bringeth a snare,\" than himself? Or who combined more moral\r\n    courage with exceeding tenderness of spirit? Or who adhered more\r\n    heroically to his convictions of duty in the face of deadly\r\n    peril and certain suffering? Or who gave himself more\r\n    unreservedly, or with greater disinterestedness, to the service\r\n    of bleeding humanity? Or who took more joyfully the spoiling of\r\n    his goods as the penalty of his sympathy for the hunted\r\n    fugitive? Or who more untiringly kept pace with all the\r\n    progressive movements of the age, as though in the very\r\n    freshness of adult life, while venerable with years? Or who, as\r\n    a husband, father, friend, citizen, or neighbor, more nobly\r\n    performed all the duties, or more generally distributed all the\r\n    charities of life? He will leave a great void in the community.\r\n    Such a stalwart soul appears only at rare intervals. Delaware,\r\n    enslaved, treated him like a felon; Delaware, redeemed, will be\r\n    proud of his memory.\r\n\r\n      \"Only the actions of the just\r\n      Smell sweet and blossom in the dust.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    His rightful place is conspicuously among the benefactors,\r\n    saviours, martyrs of the human race.\r\n\r\n    His career was full of dramatic interest from beginning to end,\r\n    and crowded with the experiences and vicissitudes of a most\r\n    eventful nature. What he promised he fulfilled; what he\r\n    attempted, he seldom, or never failed to accomplish; what he\r\n    believed, he dared to proclaim upon the housetop; what he\r\n    ardently desired, and incessantly labored for, was the reign of\r\n    universal freedom, peace, and righteousness. He was among the\r\n    manliest of men, and the gentlest of spirits. There was no form\r\n    of human suffering that did not touch his heart; but his\r\n    abounding sympathy was especially drawn out towards the poor,\r\n    imbruted slaves of the plantation, and such of their number as\r\n    sought their freedom by flight. The thousands that passed safely\r\n    through his hands, on their way to Canada and the North, will\r\n    never forget his fatherly solicitude for their welfare, or the\r\n    dangers he unflinchingly encountered in their behalf. Stripped\r\n    of all his property under the Fugitive Slave law, for giving\r\n    them food, shelter, and assistance to continue their flight, he\r\n    knew not what it was to be intimidated or disheartened, but gave\r\n    himself to the same blessed work as though conscious of no loss.\r\n    Great-hearted philanthropist, what heroism could exceed thy own?\r\n\r\n      \"For, while the jurist sitting with the slave-whip o'er him swung,\r\n      From the tortured truths of freedom the lie of slavery wrung,\r\n      And the solemn priest to Moloch, on each God-deserted shrine,\r\n      Broke the bondman's heart for bread, poured the bondman's blood\r\n                for wine--\r\n      While the multitude in blindness to a far-off Saviour knelt,\r\n      And spurned, the while, the temple where a present Saviour dwelt;\r\n      Thou beheld'st Him in the task-field, in the prison shadow dim,\r\n      And thy mercy to the bondman, it was mercy unto Him!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    I trust some one, well qualified to execute the pleasing task,\r\n    will write his biography for the grand lessons his life\r\n    inculcated. Yours, in full sympathy and trust,\r\n\r\n    WM. LLOYD GARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\nA contemporary who had known him long and intimately--who had\r\nappreciated his devotion to freedom, who had shared with him some of the\r\nperils consequent upon aiding the fleeing fugitives, and who belonged to\r\nthe race with whom Garrett sympathized, and for whose elevation and\r\nfreedom he labored so assiduously with an overflowing heart of tender\r\nregard and sympathy--penned the following words, touching the sad event:\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHATHAM, C.W., January 30, 1871.\r\n\r\n    To MR. HENRY GARRETT:--Dear Sir:--I have just heard, through the\r\n    kindness of my friend, Mrs. Graves, of the death of your dear\r\n    father; the intelligence makes me feel sad and sorrowful; I\r\n    sincerely sympathize with you and all your brothers and sisters,\r\n    in your mournful bereavement; but you do not mourn without hope,\r\n    for you have an assurance in his death that your loss is his\r\n    infinite gain. For he was a good Christian, a good husband, a\r\n    good father, a good citizen, and a truly good Samaritan, for his\r\n    heart, his hand and his purse, were ever open to the wants of\r\n    suffering humanity, wherever he found it; irrespective of the\r\n    country, religion, or complexion of the sufferer. Hence there\r\n    are many more who mourn his loss, as well as yourselves; and I\r\n    know, verily, that many a silent tear was shed by his\r\n    fellow-citizens, both white and colored, when he took his\r\n    departure; especially the colored ones; for he loved them with a\r\n    brother's love, not because they were colored, but because they\r\n    were oppressed, and, like John Brown, he loved them to the last;\r\n    that was manifest by his request that they should be his\r\n    bearers. I can better feel than I have language to express the\r\n    mournful and sorrowing pride that must have stirred the inmost\r\n    souls of those men of color, who had the honor conferred on them\r\n    of bearing his mortal remains to their last resting-place, when\r\n    they thought of what a sacred trust was committed to their\r\n    hands. We are told to mark the perfect man, and behold the\r\n    upright, for the end of that man is peace; and such was the end\r\n    of your dear father, and he has gone to join the innumerable\r\n    company of the spirits of the just, made perfect on the other\r\n    side of the river, where there is a rest remaining for all the\r\n    children of God. My brother, Abraham D. Shadd, and my sister\r\n    Amelia, join their love and condolence with mine to you all,\r\n    hoping that the virtues of your father may be a guiding star to\r\n    you all, until you meet him again in that happy place, where\r\n    parting will be no more, forever.\r\n\r\n    Your humble friend, ELIZABETH J. WILLIAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the learned and the unlearned, from those in high places and from\r\nthose in humble stations, many testimonials reached the family,\r\nrespecting this great friend of the slave, but it is doubtful, whether a\r\nsingle epistle from any one, was more affectingly appreciated by the\r\nbereaved family, than the epistle just quoted from Elizabeth J.\r\nWilliams.\r\n\r\nThe Slave's most eloquent advocate, Wendell Phillips, in the \"National\r\nStandard,\" of February 4, 1871, in honor of the departed, bore the\r\nfollowing pertinent testimony to his great worth in the cause of\r\nLiberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I should not dare to trust my memory for the number of fugitive\r\n    slaves this brave old friend has helped to safety and\r\n    freedom--nearly three thousand, I believe. What a rich life to\r\n    look back on! How skilful and adroit he was, in eluding the\r\n    hunters! How patient in waiting days and weeks, keeping the poor\r\n    fugitives hidden meanwhile, till it was safe to venture on the\r\n    highway! What whole-hearted devotion, what unselfish giving of\r\n    time, means, and everything else to this work of brotherly love!\r\n    What house in Delaware, so honorable in history, as that where\r\n    hunted men fled, and were sure to find refuge. It was the North\r\n    Star to many a fainting heart. This century has grand scenes to\r\n    show and boast of among its fellows. But few transcend that\r\n    auction-block where the sheriff was selling all Garrett's goods\r\n    for the crime (!) of giving a breakfast to a family of fugitive\r\n    slaves. As the sale closed, the officer turns to Garrett,\r\n    saying: 'Thomas, I hope you'll never be caught at this again.'\r\n\r\n    \"'Friend,' was the reply, 'I haven't a dollar in the world, but\r\n    if thee knows a fugitive who needs a breakfast, send him to me.'\r\n\r\n    \"Over such a scene, Luther and Howard and Clarkson clapped their\r\n    hands.\r\n\r\n    \"Such a speech redeems the long infamy of the State. It is\r\n    endurable, the having of such a blot as Delaware in our history,\r\n    when it has once been the home of such a man. I remember well\r\n    the just pride with which he told me, that after that sale,\r\n    pro-slavery as Wilmington was, he could have a discount at the\r\n    bank as readily as any man in the city. Though the laws robbed\r\n    him, his fellow-citizens could not but respect and trust him,\r\n    love and honor him.\r\n\r\n    \"The city has never had, we believe, a man die in it worthy of a\r\n    statue. We advise it to seize this opportunity to honor itself\r\n    and perpetuate the good name of its worthiest citizen, by\r\n    immortalizing some street, spot, shaft or building with his\r\n    name.\r\n\r\n    \"Brave, generous, high-souled, sturdy, outspoken friend of all\r\n    that needed aid or sympathy, farewell for these scenes! In times\r\n    to come, when friendless men and hated ideas need champions, God\r\n    grant them as gallant and successful ones as you have been, and\r\n    may the State you honored grow worthy of you. WENDELL PHILLIPS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLikewise in the \"National Standard,\" the editor, Aaron M. Powell, who\r\nattended the funeral, paid the following glowing tribute to the moral,\r\nreligious, and anti-slavery character of the slave's friend:\r\n\r\n\r\n    On the 24th inst., Thomas Garrett, in his eighty-second year,\r\n    passed on to the higher life. A week previous we had visited him\r\n    in his sick chamber, and, on leaving him felt that he must go\r\n    hence ere long. He was the same strong, resolute man in spirit\r\n    to the last. He looked forward to the welcome change with\r\n    perfect serenity and peace of mind. And well he might, for he\r\n    had indeed fought the good fight and been faithful unto the end.\r\n\r\n    He was most widely known for his services to fugitive slaves.\r\n    Twenty-five hundred and forty-five he had preserved a record of;\r\n    and he had assisted somewhat more than two hundred prior to the\r\n    commencement of the record. Picture to the mind's eye this\r\n    remarkable procession of nearly three thousand men, women and\r\n    children fleeing from Slavery, and finding in this brave,\r\n    large-hearted man, a friend equal to their needs in so critical\r\n    an emergency! No wonder he was feared by the slave-holders, not\r\n    alone of his own State, but of the whole South. If their human\r\n    chattels once reached his outpost, there was indeed little hope\r\n    of their reclamation. The friend and helper of fugitives from\r\n    Slavery, truly their Moses, he was more than this, he was the\r\n    discriminating, outspoken, uncompromising opponent of Slavery\r\n    itself. He was one of the strongest pillars and one of the most\r\n    efficient working-members of the American Anti-slavery Society.\r\n    He was an abolitionist of the most radical and pronounced\r\n    character, though a resident of a slave State, and through all\r\n    the period wherein to be an abolitionist was to put in jeopardy,\r\n    not only reputation and property, but life itself. Though he\r\n    rarely addressed public meetings, his presence imparted much\r\n    strength to others, was \"weighty\" in the best Quaker sense. He\r\n    was of the rare type of character, represented by Francis\r\n    Jackson and James Mott.\r\n\r\n    Thomas Garrett was a member of the Society of Friends, and as\r\n    such, served by the striking contrast of his own life and\r\n    character, with the average of the Society, to exemplify to the\r\n    world the real, genuine Quakerism. It is not at all to the\r\n    credit of his fellow-members, that it must be said of them, that\r\n    when he was bearing the cross and doing the work for which he is\r\n    now so universally honored, they, many of them, were not only\r\n    not in sympathy with him, but would undoubtedly, if they had had\r\n    the requisite vitality and courage, have cut him off from their\r\n    denominational fellowship. He was a sincere, earnest believer in\r\n    the cardinal point of Quakerism, the Divine presence in the\r\n    human soul--this furnishes the key to his action through life.\r\n    This divine attribute he regarded not as the birth-right of\r\n    Friends alone, not of one race, sex or class, but of all\r\n    mankind. Therefore was he an abolitionist; therefore was he\r\n    interested in the cause of the Indians; therefore was he\r\n    enlisted in the cause of equal rights for women; therefore was\r\n    he a friend of temperance, of oppressed and needy working-men\r\n    and women, world-wide in the scope of his philanthropic\r\n    sympathy, and broadly catholic, and comprehensive in his views\r\n    of religious life and duty. He was the soul of honor in\r\n    business. His experience, when deprived at sixty, of every\r\n    dollar of his property for having obeyed God rather than man, in\r\n    assisting fugitives from Slavery, and the promptness with which\r\n    his friends came forward with proffered co-operation, furnishes\r\n    a lesson which all should ponder well. He had little respect\r\n    for, or patience with shams of any kind, in religious, political\r\n    or social life.\r\n\r\n    As we looked upon Thomas Garrett's calm, serene face, mature in\r\n    a ripe old age, still shadowing forth kindliness of heart,\r\n    firmness of purpose, discriminating intelligence, conscientious,\r\n    manly uprightness, death never seemed more beautiful:\r\n\r\n      \"Why, what is Death but Life\r\n      In other forms of being? Life without\r\n      The coarser attributes of men, the dull\r\n      And momently decaying frame which holds\r\n      The ethereal spirit in, and binds it down\r\n      To brotherhood with brutes! There's no\r\n      Such thing as Death; what's so-called is but\r\n      The beginning of a new existence, a fresh\r\n      Segment of the eternal round of change.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    A.M.P.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother warm admirer of this Great Lover of humanity, in a letter to\r\nGeorge W. Stone thus alludes to his life and death:\r\n\r\n\r\n    TAUNTON, MASS., June 25th, 1871.\r\n\r\n    DEAR STONE:--Your telegram announcing the death of that old\r\n    soldier and saint, and my good friend, Thos. Garrett, reached me\r\n    last evening at ten o'clock.\r\n\r\n    My first impulse was to start for Wilmington, and be present at\r\n    his funeral; but when I considered my work here, and my\r\n    engagements for the next four days, I found it impossible to go.\r\n\r\n    I will be there in spirit, and bow my inmost soul before the All\r\n    Loving One, his Father and ours, in humble thankfulness, that I\r\n    ever knew him, and had the privilege of enjoying his friendship\r\n    and witnessing his devotion, to the interest of every good cause\r\n    of benevolence and Reform.\r\n\r\n    I could write you many things of interest which I heard from\r\n    him, and which I have noted on my memory and heart; but I cannot\r\n    now. I think he was one of the remarkable men of the times, in\r\n    faith, in holy boldness, in fearless devotion to the right, in\r\n    uncompromising integrity, in unselfish benevolence, in love to\r\n    God and man, and in unceasing, life-long efforts to do justly,\r\n    to love mercy, and to walk humbly with God. We shall not soon\r\n    look upon his like again.\r\n\r\n    If I was present at his funeral, I should take it as a privilege\r\n    to pronounce his name, and say, as I never said before, \"Blessed\r\n    are the dead that die in the Lord; even so saith the Spirit; for\r\n    they rest from their labors, and their works do follow them.\"\r\n\r\n    Do, at once, see his children and Clarkson Taylor, and give them\r\n    my condolence, no, my _congratulation_, and assure them that\r\n    they have a rich legacy in his noble life, and he has a glorious\r\n    reward in the bosom of God.\r\n\r\n    Peace to his memory! Noble old man, so pure and peaceful, and\r\n    yet so strong, firm, and fearless, so gentle, tender, and\r\n    truthful, afraid and ashamed of nothing but sin, and in love and\r\n    labor with every good work.\r\n\r\n    I could write on and fill many pages. But he desired no eulogy,\r\n    and needs none. He lives, and will live for ever in many hearts\r\n    and in the heaven of heavens above.\r\n\r\n    T. ISRAEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it were necessary we might continue to introduce scores of\r\neditorials, communications, epistles, etc., all breathing a similar\r\nspirit of respect for the rare worth of this wonderful man, but space\r\nforbids. In conclusion, therefore, with a view of presenting him in the\r\nlight of his own interesting letters, written when absorbed in his\r\npeculiar work, from a large number on file the following are submitted:\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILMINGTON, 11th mo. 21st, 1855.\r\n\r\n    ESTEEMED FRIEND, WM. STILL:--Thine of this date, inquiring for\r\n    the twenty-one, and how they have been disposed of, has just\r\n    been received. I can only answer by saying, when I parted with\r\n    them yesterday forenoon, I gave the wife of the person, in whose\r\n    house they were, money to pay her expenses to Philadelphia and\r\n    back in the cars to pilot the four women to thy place. I gave\r\n    her husband money to pay a pilot to start yesterday with the ten\r\n    men, divided in two gangs; also a letter for thee. I hope they\r\n    have arrived safe ere this. I had to leave town soon after noon\r\n    yesterday to attend a brother ill with an attack of apoplexy,\r\n    and to-day I have been very much engaged. The place they stayed\r\n    here is a considerable distance off. I will make inquiry\r\n    to-morrow morning, and in case any other disposition has been\r\n    made of them than the above I will write thee. I should think\r\n    they have stopped to-day, in consequence of the rain, and most\r\n    likely will arrive safe to-morrow. In haste, thy friend,\r\n\r\n    THOS. GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough having \"to attend a brother, ill with an attack of apoplexy,\"\r\nGarrett took time to attend to the interest of the \"twenty-one,\" as the\r\nabove letter indicates. How many other men in the United States, under\r\nsimilar circumstances, would have been thus faithful?\r\n\r\nOn another occasion deeply concerned for A FORWARDER OF SLAVES, he wrote\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILMINGTON, 12th mo. 26th, 1855.\r\n\r\n    ESTEEMED FRIEND, WM. STILL:--The bearer of this, George Wilmer,\r\n    is a slave, whose residence is in Maryland. He is a true man,\r\n    and a forwarder of slaves. Has passed some twenty-five within\r\n    four months. He is desirous of finding some of his relations,\r\n    Wm. Mann and Thomas Carmichael, they passed here about a month\r\n    since. If thee can give him any information where they can be\r\n    found thee will much oblige him, and run no risk of their safety\r\n    in so doing. I remain, as ever, thy sincere friend,\r\n\r\n    THOS. GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Four able-bodied men,\" form the subject of the subjoined\r\ncorrespondence:\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILMINGTON, 11th mo., 4th, 1856.\r\n\r\n    ESTEEMED FRIENDS, J. Miller McKim and William Still:--Captain\r\n    F., has arrived here this day, with four able-bodied men. One is\r\n    an engineer, and has been engaged in sawing lumber, a second, a\r\n    good house-carpenter, a third a blacksmith, and the fourth a\r\n    farm hand. They are now five hundred miles from their home in\r\n    Carolina, and would be glad to get situations, without going far\r\n    from here. I will keep them till to-morrow. Please inform me\r\n    whether thee knows of a suitable place in the country where the\r\n    mechanics can find employment at their trades for the winter;\r\n    let me hear to-morrow, and oblige your friend,\r\n\r\n    THOMAS GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What has become of Harriet Tubman?\" (agent of the Underground Rail\r\nRoad), is made a subject of special inquiry in the following note:\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILMINGTON, 3d mo., 27th, 1857.\r\n\r\n    ESTEEMED FRIEND, WILLIAM STILL:--I have been very anxious for\r\n    some time past, to hear what has become of Harriet Tubman. The\r\n    last I heard of her, she was in the State of New York, on her\r\n    way to Canada with some friends, last fall. Has thee seen, or\r\n    heard anything of her lately? It would be a sorrowful fact, if\r\n    such a hero as she, should be lost from the Underground Rail\r\n    Road. I have just received a letter from Ireland, making inquiry\r\n    respecting her. If thee gets this in time, and knows anything\r\n    respecting her, please drop me a line by mail to-morrow, and I\r\n    will get it next morning if not sooner, and oblige thy friend.\r\n\r\n    I have heard nothing from the eighth man from Dover, but trust\r\n    he is safe.\r\n\r\n    THOMAS GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn being informed that Harriet was \"all right,\" the following extract\r\nfrom a subsequent letter, expresses his satisfaction over the good news,\r\nand at the same time, indicates his sympathy for a \"poor traveler,\" who\r\nhad fallen a victim to the cold weather, and being severely\r\nfrost-bitten, had died of lock-jaw, as related on page 52.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I was truly glad to learn that Harriet Tubman was still in good\r\n    health and ready for action, but I think there will be more\r\n    danger at present than heretofore, there is so much excitement\r\n    below in consequence of the escape of those eight slaves. I was\r\n    truly sorry to hear of the fate of that poor fellow who had\r\n    periled so much for liberty. I was in hopes from what thee told\r\n    me, that he would recover with the loss perhaps of some of his\r\n    toes.\r\n\r\n    THOMAS GARRETT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the next letter, an interesting anecdote is related of an encounter\r\non the Underground Rail Road, between the fugitives and several\r\nIrishmen, and how one of the old countrymen was shot in the forehead,\r\netc., which G. thought would make such opponents to the Road \"more\r\ncautious.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILMINGTON, 11th mo., 5th, 1857.\r\n\r\n    ESTEEMED FRIEND, WILLIAM STILL:--I have just written a note for\r\n    the bearer to William Murphy Chester, who will direct him on to\r\n    thy care; he left his home about a week since. I hear in the\r\n    lower part of this State, he met with a friend to pilot him some\r\n    twenty-five miles last night. We learn that one party of those\r\n    last week were attacked with clubs by several Irish and that one\r\n    of them was shot in the forehead, the ball entering to the skull\r\n    bone, and passing under the skin partly round the head. My\r\n    informant says he is likely to recover, but it will leave an\r\n    ugly mark it is thought, as long as he lives. We have not been\r\n    able to learn, whether the party was on the look out for them,\r\n    or whether they were rowdies out on a Hallow-eve frolic; but be\r\n    it which it may, I presume they will be more cautious here how\r\n    they trifle with such. Desiring thee prosperity and happiness, I\r\n    remain thy friend,\r\n\r\n    THOMAS GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUR OF GOD'S POOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following letter shows the fearless manner in which he attended to\r\nthe duties of his station:\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILMINGTON, 9th mo. 6th, 1857.\r\n\r\n    RESPECTED FRIEND, WM. STILL:--This evening I send to thy care\r\n    four of God's poor. Severn Johnson, a true man, will go with\r\n    them to-night by rail road to thy house. I have given Johnson\r\n    five dollars, which will pay all expenses, and leave each\r\n    twenty-five cents. We are indebted to Captain F----t----n for\r\n    those. May success attend them in their efforts to maintain\r\n    themselves. Please send word by Johnson whether or no, those\r\n    seven arrived safe I wrote thee of ten days since. My wife and\r\n    self were at Longwood to-day, had a pleasant ride and good\r\n    meeting. We are, as ever, thy friend,\r\n\r\n    THOS. GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuite a satisfactory account is given, in the letter below of the\r\n\"Irishman who was shot in the forehead;\" also of one of the same kin,\r\nwho in meddling with Underground Rail Road passengers, got his arm\r\nbroken in two places, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILMINGTON, 11th mo. 14th, 1857.\r\n\r\n    ESTEEMED FRIEND, WM. STILL:--Thy favor of a few days since came\r\n    to hand, giving quite a satisfactory account of the large\r\n    company.\r\n\r\n    I find in the melee near this town, one of the Irishmen got his\r\n    arm broken in two places. The one shot in the forehead is badly\r\n    marked, but not dangerously injured. I learn to-day, that the\r\n    carriage in that company, owing to fast driving with such a\r\n    heavy load, is badly broken, and the poor horse was badly\r\n    injured; it has not been able to do anything since.\r\n\r\n    Please say to my friend, Rebecca Hart, that I have heretofore\r\n    kept clear of persuading, or even advising slaves to leave their\r\n    masters till they had fully made up their minds to leave,\r\n    knowing as I do there is great risk in so doing, and if betrayed\r\n    once would be a serious injury to the cause hereafter. I had\r\n    spoken to one colored man to try to see him, but he was not\r\n    willing to risk it. If he has any desire to get away, he can,\r\n    during one night, before they miss him, get out of the reach of\r\n    danger. Booth has moved into New Castle, and left the two boys\r\n    on the farm. If Rebecca Hart will write to me, and give me the\r\n    name of the boy, and the name of his mother, I will make another\r\n    effort. The man I spoke to lives in New Castle, and thinks the\r\n    mother of the boy alluded to lives between here and New Castle.\r\n    The young men's association here wants Wendell Phillips to\r\n    deliver a lecture on the lost arts, and some of the rest of us\r\n    wish him to deliver a lecture on Slavery. Where will a letter\r\n    reach him soonest, as I wish to write him on the subject. I\r\n    thought he could perhaps deliver two lectures, two nights in\r\n    succession. If thee can give the above information, thee will\r\n    much oblige--\r\n\r\n    GARRETT & SON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his business-like transactions, without concealment, he places\r\nmatters in such a light that the wayfaring man, though a fool, need not\r\nerr, as may here be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILMINGTON, 11th mo. 25th, 1857.\r\n\r\n    ESTEEMED FRIEND, WM. STILL:--I now send Johnson, one of our\r\n    colored men, up with the three men I wrote thee about. Johnson\r\n    has undertook to have them well washed and cleaned during the\r\n    day. And I have provided them with some second-hand clothes, to\r\n    make them comfortable, a new pair of shoes and stockings, and\r\n    shall pay Johnson for taking care of them. I mention this so\r\n    that thee may know. Thee need not advance him any funds. In the\r\n    present case I shall furnish them with money to pay their fare\r\n    to Philadelphia, and Johnson home again. Hoping they will get on\r\n    safe, I remain thy friend,\r\n\r\n    THOS. GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUR FEMALES ON BOARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fearless Garrett communicated through the mail, as usual, the\r\nfollowing intelligence:\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILMINGTON, 8th mo. 25th, 1859.\r\n\r\n    ESTEEMED FRIEND, WM. STILL:--The brig Alvena, of Lewistown, is\r\n    in the Delaware opposite here, with four females on board. The\r\n    colored man, who has them in charge, was employed by the husband\r\n    of one of them to bring his wife up. When he arrived here, he\r\n    found the man had left. As the vessel is bound to Red Bank, I\r\n    have advised him to take them there in the vessel, and to-morrow\r\n    take them in the steamboat to the city, and to the Anti-slavery\r\n    office. He says they owe the captain one dollar and fifty cents\r\n    for board, and I gave him three dollars, to pay the captain and\r\n    take them to your office. I have a man here, to go on to-night,\r\n    that was nearly naked; shall rig him out pretty comfortably.\r\n    Poor fellow, he has lost his left hand, but he says he can take\r\n    care of himself. In haste, thy friend,\r\n\r\n    THOS. GARRETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Father Abraham was using his utmost powers to put down the\r\nrebellion, in 1864, a young man who had \"been most unrighteously sold\r\nfor seven years,\" desirous of enlisting, sought advice from the wise and\r\nfaithful Underground Rail Road manager, who gave him the following\r\nletter, which may be looked upon in the light of a rare anecdote, as\r\nthere is no doubt but that the \"professed non-resistant\" in this\r\ninstance, hoped to see the poor fellow \"_snugly fixed in his\r\nregimentals_\" doing service for \"Father Abraham.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILMINGTON, 1st mo. 23d, 1864.\r\n\r\n    RESPECTED FRIEND, WILLIAM STILL:--The bearer of this, Winlock\r\n    Clark, has lately been most unrighteously sold for seven years,\r\n    and is desirous of enlisting, and becoming one of Uncle Sam's\r\n    boys; I have advised him to call on thee so that no land sharks\r\n    shall get any bounty for enlisting him; he has a wife and\r\n    several children, and whatever bounty the government or the\r\n    State allows him, will be of use to his family. Please write me\r\n    when he is snugly fixed in his regimentals, so that I may send\r\n    word to his wife. By so doing, thee will much oblige thy friend,\r\n    and the friend of humanity,\r\n\r\n    THOMAS GARRETT.\r\n\r\n    N.B. Am I naughty, being a professed non-resistant, to advise\r\n    this poor fellow to serve Father Abraham? T.G.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have given so many of these inimitable Underground Rail Road letters\r\nfrom the pen of the sturdy old laborer, not only because they will be\r\nnew to the readers of this work, but because they so fittingly\r\nillustrate his practical devotion to the Slave, and his cheerfulness--in\r\nthe face of danger and difficulty--in a manner that other pens might\r\nlabor in vain to describe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDANIEL GIBBONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA life as uneventful as the one whose story we are about to tell,\r\naffords little scope for the genius of the biographer or the historian,\r\nbut being carefully studied, it cannot fail to teach a lesson of\r\ndevotion and self-sacrifice, which should be learned and remembered by\r\nevery succeeding age.\r\n\r\nDaniel Gibbons, son of James and Deborah (Hoopes) Gibbons, was born on\r\nthe banks of Mill Creek, in Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, on the 21st\r\nday of the 12th month (December), 1775. He was descended on his father's\r\nside from an English ancestor, whose name appears on the colonial\r\nrecords, as far back as 1683. John Gibbons evidently came with or before\r\nWilliam Penn to this \"goodly heritage of freedom.\" His earthly remains\r\nlie at Concord Friends' burying-ground, Delaware county, near where the\r\nfamily lived for a generation or two. The grandfather of Daniel Gibbons,\r\nwho lived near where West Town boarding-school now is, in Chester\r\ncounty, bought for seventy pounds, \"one thousand acres of land and\r\nallowances,\" in what is now Lancaster county, intending, as he\r\nultimately did, to settle his three sons upon it. This purchase was made\r\nabout the year 1715. In process of time, the eldest son, desiring to\r\nmarry Deborah Hoopes, the daughter of Daniel Hoopes, of a neighboring\r\ntownship in Chester county, the young people obtained the consent of\r\nparents and friends, but it was a time of grief and mourning among young\r\nand old. The young Friends assured the intended bride, that they would\r\nnot marry the best man in the Province and do what she was about to do;\r\nand the elder dames, so far relaxed the Puritanic rigidity of their\r\nrules, as to allow the invitation of an uncommonly large company of\r\nguests to the wedding, in order that a long and perhaps last farewell,\r\nmight be said to the beloved daughter, who, with her husband, was about\r\nto emigrate to the \"far West.\" Loud and long were the lamentations, and\r\nwarm the embraces of these simple-minded Christian rustics, companions\r\nof toil and deprivation, as they parted from two of their number who\r\nwere to leave their circle for the West; the West being then thirty-six\r\nmiles distant. This was on the sixth day of the fifth month, 1756. More\r\nthan a century has passed away; all the good people, eighty-nine in\r\nnumber, who signed the wedding certificate as witnesses, have passed\r\naway, and how vast is the change wrought in our midst since that day!\r\n\r\nJoseph Gibbons was so much pleased with the daring enterprise of his son\r\nand daughter-in-law, that he gave them one hundred acres of land in his\r\nWestern possessions more than he reserved for his other and younger\r\nsons, and to it they immediately emigrated, and building first a cabin\r\nand the next year a store-house, began life for themselves in earnest.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting, in view of the long and consistent anti-slavery\r\ncourse which Daniel Gibbons pursued, to trace the influence that wrought\r\nupon him while his character was maturing, and the causes which led him\r\nto see the wickedness of the system which he opposed.\r\n\r\nThe Society of Friends in that day bore in mind the advice of their\r\ngreat founder, Fox, whose last words were: \"Friends, mind the light.\"\r\nAnd following that guide which leads out of all evil and into all good,\r\nthey viewed every custom of society with eyes undimmed by prejudice, and\r\nwere influenced in every action of life by a belief in the common\r\nbrotherhood of man, and a resolve to obey the command of Jesus, to love\r\none another. This being the case, slavery and oppression of all kinds\r\nwere unpopular, and indeed almost unknown amongst them.\r\n\r\nJames Gibbons was a republican, and an enthusiastic advocate of American\r\nliberty. Being a man of commanding presence, and great energy and\r\ndetermination, efforts were made during the Revolution to induce him to\r\nenlist as a cavalry soldier. He was prevented from so doing by the\r\nentreaties of his wife, and his own conscientious scruples as a Friend.\r\nAbout the time of the Revolution, or immediately after, he removed to\r\nthe borough of Wilmington, Delaware, where, being surrounded by slavery,\r\nhe became more than ever alive to its iniquities. He was interested\r\nduring his whole life in getting slaves off. And being elected second\r\nburgess of Wilmington during his residence there, his official position\r\ngave him great opportunities to assist in this noble work. It is related\r\nthat during his magistracy a slave-holder brought a colored man before\r\nhim, whom he claimed as his slave. There being no evidence of the\r\nalleged ownership, the colored man was set at liberty. The pretended\r\nowner was inclined to be impudent; but James Gibbons told him promptly\r\nthat nothing but silence and good behaviour on his part would prevent\r\nhis commitment for contempt of court.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1790, James Gibbons came back to Lancaster county, where\r\nhe spent twenty years in the practice of those deeds which will remain\r\n\"in everlasting remembrance;\" dying, full of years and honors, in 1810.\r\n\r\nBorn in the first year of the revolution and growing up surrounded by\r\nsuch influences, Daniel Gibbons could not have been other than he was,\r\nthe friend of the down-trodden and oppressed of every nationality and\r\ncolor. In 1789 his father took him to see General Washington, then\r\npassing through Wilmington. To the end of his life he retained a vivid\r\nrecollection of this visit, and would recount its incidents to his\r\nfamily and friends. During his father's residence in Wilmington, he\r\nspent his summers with kinsmen in Lancaster county, learning to be a\r\nfarmer, and his winters in Wilmington going to school.\r\n\r\nAt the age of fourteen years he was bound an apprentice, as was the good\r\ncustom of the day, to a Friend in Lancaster county to learn the tanning\r\nbusiness. At this he served about six years, or until his master ceased\r\nto follow the business. During this apprenticeship he became accustomed\r\nto severe labor, so severe indeed that he never recovered from the\r\neffects thereof, having a difficulty in walking during the remainder of\r\nhis life, which prevented him from taking the active part in Underground\r\nRail Road business which he otherwise would have done. His father's\r\nestate being involved in litigation caused him to be put to this trade,\r\nfarming being his favorite employment, and one which he followed during\r\nhis whole life.\r\n\r\nIn 1805 he took a pedestrian tour, by way of New York, Albany, and\r\nNiagara Falls to the State of Ohio, then the far West, coming home by\r\nway of Pittsburg, and walking altogether one thousand three hundred and\r\nfifty miles. In this trip he increased the injury to his feet, so as to\r\nrender himself virtually a cripple. Upon the death of his father, he\r\nsettled upon the farm, on which he died.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1808 on going to visit some friends, who had removed to\r\nAdams county, Pennsylvania, he became acquainted with Hannah Wierman,\r\nwhom he married on the fourth day of the fifth month, 1815. At this time\r\nDaniel Gibbous was about forty years old, and his wife about\r\ntwenty-eight, she having been born on the ninth of the seventh month,\r\n1787. A life of one after their union, would be incomplete without some\r\nnotice of the other.\r\n\r\nDuring a married life of thirty-seven years, Hannah Gibbons was the\r\nassistant of her husband in every good and noble work. Possessed of a\r\nwarm heart, a powerful, though uncultivated intellect, an excellent\r\njudgment, and great sweetness of disposition, she was fitted both by\r\nnature and training to endure without murmuring the inconvenience and\r\ntrouble incident to the reception and care of fugitives and to rejoice\r\nthat to her was given the opportunity of assisting them in their efforts\r\nto be free.\r\n\r\nThe true measure of greatness in a human soul, is its willingness to\r\nsuffer for its own good, or the good of its fellows, its\r\nself-sacrificing spirit. Granting the truth of this, one of the greatest\r\nsouls was that of Hannah W. Gibbons. The following incident is a proof\r\nof this:\r\n\r\nIn 1836, when she was no longer a young woman, there came to her home,\r\none of the poorest, most ignorant, and filthiest of mankind--a slave\r\nfrom the great valley of Virginia. He was foot-sore and weary, and could\r\nnot tell how he came, or who directed him. He seemed indeed, a missive\r\ndirected and sent by the hand of the Almighty. Before he could be\r\ncleansed or recruited, he was taken sick, and before he could be removed\r\n(even if he could have been trusted at the county poor house), his case\r\nwas pronounced to be small-pox. For six long weeks did this good angel\r\nin human form, attend upon this unfortunate object. Reasons were found\r\nwhy no one else could do it, and with her own hands, she ministered to\r\nhis wants, until he was restored to health. Such was her life. This is\r\nmerely one case. She was always ready to do her duty. Her interest in\r\ngood, never left her, for when almost dying, she aroused from her\r\nlethargy and asked if Abraham Lincoln was elected president of the\r\nUnited States, which he was a few days afterwards. She always predicted\r\na civil war, in the settlement of the Slavery question.\r\n\r\nDuring the last twenty-five years of her life she was an elder in the\r\nSociety of Friends, of which she had always been an earnest, consistent,\r\nand devoted member. Her patience, self-denial, and warm affection were\r\nmanifested in every relation of life. As a daughter, wife, mother,\r\nfriend, and mistress of a family she was beloved by all, and to her\r\nrelatives and friends who are left behind, the remembrance of her good\r\ndeeds comes wafted like a perfume from beyond the golden gates. She\r\nsurvived her husband about eight years, dying on the sixteenth of the\r\ntenth month, 1860. Three children, sons, were born to their marriage,\r\ntwo of whom died in infancy and one still (1871) survives.\r\n\r\nTo give some idea of the course pursued by Daniel and Hannah Gibbons, I\r\ninsert the following letter, containing an account of events which took\r\nplace in 1821:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"A short time since, I learned that my old friend, William\r\n    Still, was about to publish a history of the Underground Rail\r\n    Road. His own experience in the service of this road would make\r\n    a large volume. I was brought up by Daniel Gibbons, and am asked\r\n    to say what I know of him as an abolitionist. From my earliest\r\n    recollection, he was a friend to the colored people, and often\r\n    hired them and paid them liberal wages. His house was a depot\r\n    for fugitives, and many hundreds has he helped on their way to\r\n    freedom. Many a dark night he has sent me to carry them victuals\r\n    and change their places of refuge, and take them to other\r\n    people's barns, when not safe for him to go. I have known him\r\n    start in the night and go fifty miles with them, when they were\r\n    very hotly pursued. One man and his wife lived with him for a\r\n    long time. Afterwards the man lived with Thornton Walton. The\r\n    man was hauling lumber from Columbia. He was taken from his team\r\n    in Lancaster, and lodged in Baltimore jail. Daniel Gibbons went\r\n    to Baltimore, visited the jail and tried hard to get him\r\n    released, but failed. I would add here, that Daniel Gibbons'\r\n    faithful wife, one of the best women I ever knew, was always\r\n    ready, day or night, to do all she possibly could, to help the\r\n    poor fugitives on their way to freedom. Many interesting\r\n    incidents occurred at the home of my uncle. I will relate one.\r\n    He had living with him at one time, two colored men, Thomas\r\n    Colbert and John Stewart. The latter was from Maryland; John\r\n    often said he would go back and get his wife. My uncle asked him\r\n    if he was not afraid of his master's catching him. He said no,\r\n    for his master knew if he undertook to take him, he would kill\r\n    him. He did go and brought his wife to my uncle's.\r\n\r\n    While these two large men, Tom and John, were there, along came\r\n    Robert (other name unknown), in a bad plight, his feet bleeding.\r\n    Robert was put in the barn to thrash, until he could be fixed up\r\n    to go again on his journey. But in a few days, behold, along\r\n    came his master. He brought with him that notorious constable,\r\n    Haines, from Lancaster, and one other man. They came suddenly\r\n    upon Robert; as soon as he saw them he ran and jumped out of the\r\n    \"overshoot,\" some ten feet down. In jumping, he put one knee out\r\n    of joint. The men ran around the barn and seized him. By this\r\n    time, the two colored men, Tom and John, came, together with my\r\n    uncle and aunt. Poor Robert owned his master, but John told them\r\n    they should not take him away, and was going at them with a\r\n    club. One of the men drew a pistol to shoot John, but uncle told\r\n    him he had better not shoot him; this was not a slave State.\r\n    Inasmuch as Robert had owned his master, Uncle told John he must\r\n    submit, so they put Robert on a horse, and started with him.\r\n    After they were gone John said: \"Mr. Gibbons, just say the word,\r\n    and I will bring Robert back.\" Aunt said: \"Go, John, go!\" So\r\n    John ran to Joseph Rakestraw's and got a gun (without any lock),\r\n    and ran across the fields, with Tom after him, and headed the\r\n    party. The men all ran except Haines, who kept Robert between\r\n    himself and John, so that John should not shoot him. But John\r\n    called out to Robert to drop off that horse, or he would shoot\r\n    him. This Robert did, and John and Tom brought him back in\r\n    triumph. My aunt said: \"John, thee is a good fellow, thee has\r\n    done well.\" Robert was taken to Jesse Gilbert's barn, and Dr.\r\n    Dingee fixed his knee. As soon as he was able to travel, he took\r\n    a \"bee-line\" for the North star.\r\n\r\n    My life with my uncle and aunt made me an abolitionist. I left\r\n    them in the winter of 1824, and came to Salem, Ohio, where I\r\n    kept a small station on the Underground Rail Road, until the\r\n    United States government took my work away. I have helped over\r\n    two hundred fugitives on their way to Canada.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully,\r\n\r\n    DANIEL BONSALL,\r\n\r\n    Salem, Columbiana county, Ohio.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day, in the winter of 1822, Thomas Johnson, a colored man, living\r\nwith Daniel Gibbons, went out early in the morning, to set traps for\r\nmuskrats. While he was gone, a slave-holder came to the house and\r\ninquired for his slave. Daniel Gibbons said: \"There is no slave here of\r\nthat name.\" The man replied: \"I know he is here. The man we're after, is\r\na miserable, worthless, thieving scoundrel.\" \"Oh! very well, then,\" said\r\nthe good Quaker, \"if that's the kind of man thee's after, then I know he\r\nis not here. We have a colored man here, but he is not that kind of a\r\nman.\" The slaveholder waited awhile, the man not making his appearance,\r\nthen said: \"Well, now, Mr. Gibbons, when you see that man next, tell him\r\nthat we were here, and if he will come home, we will take good care of\r\nhim, and be kind to him.\" \"Very well,\" said Daniel, \"I will tell him\r\nwhat thee says, but say to him at the same time, that he is a very great\r\nfool, if he does as thee requests.\" The colored man sought, having\r\ncaught sight of the slaveholders, and knowing who they were, went off\r\nthat night, under Daniel Gibbons' directions, and was never seen by his\r\nmaster again. Afterward, Daniel and his nephew, William Gibbons, went\r\nwith this man to Adams county. With his master came the master of Mary,\r\na girl with straight hair, and nearly white, who lived with Daniel\r\nGibbons and his wife. Poor Mary was unfortunate. Her master caught her,\r\nand took her back with him into Slavery. She and a little girl, who was\r\ntaken away about the year 1830, were the only ones ever taken back from\r\nthe house of Daniel Gibbons.\r\n\r\nBetween the time of his marriage, when he began to keep a depot on the\r\nUnderground Rail Road, and the year 1824, he passed more than one\r\nhundred slaves through to Canada, and between the latter time and his\r\ndeath, eight hundred more, making, in all nine hundred aided by him. He\r\nwas ever willing to sacrifice his own personal comfort and convenience,\r\nin order to assist fugitives. In 1833, when on his way to the West, in a\r\ncarriage, with his friend, Thomas Peart, also a most faithful friend of\r\nthe colored man and interested in Underground Rail Road affairs, he\r\nfound a fugitive slave, a woman, in Adams county, who was in immediate\r\ndanger. He stopped his journey, and sent his horse and wagon back to his\r\nown home with the woman, that being the only safe way of getting her\r\noff. This was but a sample of his self-denial, in the cause of human\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nHis want of ability to guide in person runaway slaves, or to travel with\r\nthem, prevented him from taking active part in the wonderful adventures\r\nand hair-breadth escapes which his brain and tact rendered possible and\r\nsuccessful. It is believed that no slave was ever recaptured that\r\nfollowed his directions. Sometimes the abolitionists were much annoyed\r\nby impostors, who pretended to be runaways, in order to discover their\r\nplans, and betray them to the slave-holders. Daniel Gibbons was\r\npossessed of much acuteness in detecting these people, but having\r\ndetected them, he never treated them harshly or unkindly.\r\n\r\nAlmost from infancy, he was distinguished for the gravity of his\r\ndeportment, and his utter heedlessness of small things. The writer has\r\nheard men preach the doctrine of the trifling value of the things of a\r\npresent time, and of the tremendous importance of those of a\r\nnever-ending eternity, but Daniel Gibbons is the only person she ever\r\nknew, who lived that doctrine. He believed in plainness of apparel as\r\ntaught by Friends, not as a form or a rule of society, but as a\r\nprinciple; often quoting from some one who said that \"the adornment of a\r\nvain and foolish world, would feed a starving one.\" He opposed\r\nextravagant fashions and all luxury of habit and life, as calculated to\r\nproduce effeminacy and degrading sensuality, and as a bestowal of\r\nidolatrous attention upon that body which he would often say \"was here\r\nbut for a short time.\"\r\n\r\nLooking only upon that as religion, which made men love each other and\r\ndo good to each other in this world, he was little of a stickler for\r\npoints of belief, and even when he did look into theological matters or\r\ndenounce a man's religious opinions, it was generally because they were\r\ncalculated to darken the mind and be entertained as a substitute for\r\ngood works. Pursuing the even tenor of his way, he could as easily lead\r\nthe flying fugitive slave by night out of the way of his powerful\r\nmaster, as one differently constituted could bestow his wealth upon the\r\nmost popular charity in the land.\r\n\r\nHis faith was of the simplest kind--the Parable of the prodigal son,\r\ncontains his creed. Discarding what are commonly called \"plans of\r\nsalvation,\" he believed in the light \"which lighteth every man that\r\ncometh into the world,\" and that if people would follow this light, they\r\nwould thus seek \"the kingdom of Heaven and its righteousness and all\r\nother things needful would be added thereunto.\" He was a devoted member\r\nof the Society of Friends, in which he held the position of elder,\r\nduring the last twenty-five years of his life. That peculiar doctrine of\r\nthe Society, which repudiates systematic divinity and with it a paid\r\nministry, he held in special reverence, finding confirmation of its\r\ntruth in the general advocacy of Slavery, by the popular clergy of his\r\nday.\r\n\r\nWhen he was quite advanced in years, and the Anti-slavery agitation grew\r\nwarm, he was solicited to join an anti-slavery society, but on hearing\r\nthe constitution read, and finding that it repudiated all use of\r\nphysical force on the part of the oppressed in gaining their liberty, he\r\nsaid that he could not assent to that--that he had long been engaged in\r\ngetting off slaves, and that he had always advised them to use force,\r\nalthough remonstrating against going to the extent of taking life, and\r\nthat now he could not recede from that position, and he did not see how\r\nthey could always be got off without the use of some force.\r\n\r\nHis faith in an overruling Providence was complete. He believed, even in\r\nthe darkest days of freedom in our land, in the ultimate extinction of\r\nSlavery, and at times, although advanced in years, thought he would live\r\nto witness that glorious consummation. It is only in a man's own family\r\nand by his wife and children, that he is really known, and it is by\r\nthose who best knew, and indeed, who only knew this good man, that his\r\nbiographer is most anxious that he should be judged. As a parent, he was\r\nnot excessively indulgent, as a husband, one more nearly a model is\r\nrarely found. But his kindness in domestic life, his love for his wife,\r\nhis son and his grandchildren, and their reciprocal love and affection\r\nfor him, no words can express.\r\n\r\nIt was in his father's household in his youth and in his own household\r\nin his mature years, that was fostered that wealth of love and\r\naffection, which, extending and widening, took in the whole race, and\r\nmade him the friend of the oppressed everywhere, and especially of those\r\nwhom it was a dangerous and unpopular task to befriend.\r\n\r\nThe tenderness and thoughtfulness of his disposition are well shown in\r\nthe following incident: Upon one occasion, his son received a kick from\r\na horse, which he was about to mount at the door. When he had recovered\r\nfrom the shock, and it was found that he was not seriously injured, the\r\nfather still continued to look serious, and did not cease to shed tears.\r\nOn being asked why he grieved, his answer was: \"I was just thinking how\r\nit would have been with thee, had that stroke proved fatal.\" Such\r\nthoughts were at once the notes of his own preparation and a warning to\r\nothers to be also ready.\r\n\r\nA life consistent with his views, was a life of humility and universal\r\nbenevolence, and such was his. It was a life, as it were in Heaven,\r\nwhile yet on earth, for it soared above and beyond the corrupt and\r\nslavish influences of earthly passions.\r\n\r\nHis interest in temperance never failed him. On his death-bed he would\r\ncall persons to him, who needed such advice, and admonish them on the\r\nsubject of using strong drinks, and his last expression of interest in\r\nany humanitarian movement, was an avowal of his belief in the great good\r\nto arise from a prohibitory liquor law.\r\n\r\nTo a friend, who entered his sick room, a few days before his death, he\r\nsaid: \"Well, E., thee is preparing to go to the West.\" The friend\r\nreplied: \"Yes, and Daniel, I suppose thee is preparing to go to\r\neternity.\" There was an affirmative reply, and E. inquired, \"How does\r\nthee find it?\" Daniel said: \"I don't find much to do, I find that I have\r\nnot got a hard master to deal with. Some few things which I have done, I\r\nfind not entirely right.\" He quitted the earthly service of the Master,\r\non the 17th day of the eighth month, 1852.\r\n\r\nA young physician, son of one of his old friends, after attending his\r\nfuneral, wrote to a friend, as follows: \"To quote the words of Webster,\r\n'We turned and paused, and joined our voices with the voices of the air,\r\nand bade him hail! and farewell!' Farewell, kind and brave old man! The\r\nvoices of the oppressed whom thou hast redeemed, welcome thee to the\r\nEternal City.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLUCRETIA MOTT.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the women who served the Anti-slavery cause in its darkest days,\r\nthere is not one whose labors were more effective, whose character is\r\nnobler, and who is more universally respected and beloved, than Lucretia\r\nMott. You cannot speak of the slave without remembering her, who did so\r\nmuch to make Slavery impossible. You cannot speak of freedom, without\r\nrecalling that enfranchised spirit, which, free from all control, save\r\nthat of conscience and God, labored for absolute liberty for the whole\r\nhuman race. We cannot think of the partial triumph of freedom in this\r\ncountry, without rejoicing in the great part she took in the victory.\r\nLucretia Mott is one of the noblest representatives of ideal womanhood.\r\nThose who know her, need not be told this, but those who only love her\r\nin the spirit, may be sure that they can have no faith too great in the\r\nbeauty of her pure and Christian life.\r\n\r\nThis book would be incomplete without giving some account, however\r\nbrief, of Lucretia Mott's character and labors in the great work to\r\nwhich her life has been devoted. To write it fully would require a\r\nvolume. She was born in 1793, in the island of Nantucket, and is\r\ndescended from the Coffins and Macys, on the father's side, and from the\r\nFolgers, on the mother's side, and through them is related to Dr.\r\nBenjamin Franklin. Her maiden name was Lucretia Coffin.\r\n\r\nDuring the absence of her father on a long voyage, her mother was\r\nengaged in mercantile business, purchasing goods in Boston, in exchange\r\nfor oil and candles, the staples of the island. Mrs. Mott says in\r\nreference to this employment: \"The exercise of women's talent in this\r\nline, as well as the general care which devolved upon them in the\r\nabsence of their husbands, tended to develop their intellectual powers,\r\nand strengthened them mentally and physically.\"\r\n\r\nThe family removed to Boston in 1804. Her parents belonged to the\r\nreligious Society of Friends, and carefully cultivated in their\r\nchildren, the peculiarities as well as the principles of that sect. To\r\nthis early training, we may ascribe the rigid adherence of Mrs. Mott, to\r\nthe beautiful but sober costume of the Society.\r\n\r\nWhen in London, in 1840, she visited the Zoological Gardens, and a\r\ngentleman of the party, pointing out the splendid plumage of some\r\ntropical birds, remarked: \"You see, Mrs. Mott, our heavenly Father\r\nbelieves in bright colors. How much it would take from our pleasure, if\r\nall the birds were dressed in drab.\" \"Yes;\" she replied, \"but immortal\r\nbeings do not depend upon feathers for their attractions. With the\r\ninfinite variety of the human face and form, of thought, feeling and\r\naffection, we do not need gorgeous apparel to distinguish us. Moreover,\r\nif it is fitting that woman should dress in every color of the rainbow,\r\nwhy not man also? Clergymen, with their black clothes and white cravats,\r\nare quite as monotonous as the Quakers.\" Whatever may be the abstract\r\nmerit of this argument, it is certain that the simplicity of Lucretia\r\nMott's nature, is beautifully expressed by her habitual costume.\r\n\r\nIn giving the principal events of Lucretia Mott's life, we prefer to use\r\nher own language whenever possible. In memoranda furnished by her to\r\nElizabeth Cady Stanton, she says: \"My father had a desire to make his\r\ndaughters useful. At fourteen years of age, I was placed, with a younger\r\nsister, at the Friends' Boarding School, in Dutchess county, State of\r\nNew York, and continued there for more than two years, without returning\r\nhome. At fifteen, one of the teachers leaving the school, I was chosen\r\nas an assistant in her place. Pleased with the promotion, I strove hard\r\nto give satisfaction, and was gratified, on leaving the school, to have\r\nan offer of a situation as teacher if I was disposed to remain; and\r\ninformed that my services should entitle another sister to her\r\neducation, without charge. My father was at that time, in successful\r\nbusiness in Boston, but with his views of the importance of training a\r\nwoman to usefulness, he and my mother gave their consent to another year\r\nbeing devoted to that institution.\" Here is another instance of the\r\nimmeasurable value of wise parental influence.\r\n\r\nIn 1809 Lucretia joined her family in Philadelphia, whither they had\r\nremoved. \"At the early age of eighteen,\" she says, \"I married James\r\nMott, of New York--an attachment formed while at the boarding-school.\"\r\nMr. Mott entered into business with her father. Then followed commercial\r\ndepressions, the war of 1812, the death of her father, and the family\r\nbecame involved in difficulties. Mrs. Mott was again obliged to resume\r\nteaching. \"These trials,\" she says, \"in early life, were not without\r\ntheir good effect in disciplining the mind, and leading it to set a just\r\nestimate on worldly pleasures.\"\r\n\r\nTo this early training, to the example of a noble father and excellent\r\nmother, to the trials which came so quickly in her life, the rapid\r\ndevelopment of Mrs. Mott's intellect is no doubt greatly due. Thus the\r\nfoundation was laid, which has enabled her, for more than fifty years,\r\nto be one of the great workers in the cause of suffering humanity. These\r\nare golden words which we quote from her own modest notes: \"I, however,\r\nalways loved the good, in childhood desired to do the right, and had no\r\nfaith in the generally received idea of human depravity.\" Yes, it was\r\nbecause she believed in human virtue, that she was enabled to accomplish\r\nsuch a wonderful work. She had the inspiration of faith, and entered her\r\nlife-battle against Slavery with a divine hope, and not with a gloomy\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nThe next great step in Lucretia Mott's career, was taken at the age of\r\ntwenty-five, when, \"summoned by a little family and many cares, I felt\r\ncalled to a more public life of devotion to duty, and engaged in the\r\nministry in our Society.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1827 when the Society was divided Mrs. Mott's convictions led her \"to\r\nadhere to the sufficiency of the light within us, resting on the truth\r\nas authority, rather than 'taking authority for truth.'\" We may find no\r\nbetter place than this to refer to her relations to Christianity. There\r\nare many people who do not believe in the progress of religion. They are\r\nright in one respect. God's truth cannot be progressive because it is\r\nabsolute, immutable and eternal. But the human race is struggling up to\r\na higher comprehension of its own destiny and of the mysterious purposes\r\nof God so far as they are revealed to our finite intelligence. It is in\r\nthis sense that religion is progressive. The Christianity of this age\r\nought to be more intelligent than the Christianity of Calvin. \"The\r\npopular doctrine of human depravity,\" says Mrs. Mott, \"never commended\r\nitself to my reason or conscience. I searched the Scriptures daily,\r\nfinding a construction of the text wholly different from that which was\r\npressed upon our acceptance. The highest evidence of a sound faith being\r\nthe practical life of the Christian, I have felt a far greater interest\r\nin the moral movements of our age than in any theological discussion.\"\r\nHer life is a noble evidence of the sincerity of this belief. She has\r\ntranslated Christian principles into daily deeds.\r\n\r\nThat spirit of benevolence which Mrs. Mott possesses in a degree far\r\nabove the average, of necessity had countless modes of expression. She\r\nwas not so much a champion of any particular cause as of all reforms. It\r\nwas said of Charles Lamb that he could not even hear the devil abused\r\nwithout trying to say something in his favor, and with all Mrs. Mott's\r\nintense hatred of Slavery we do not think she ever had one unkind\r\nfeeling toward the slave-holder. Her longest, and probably her noblest\r\nwork, was done in the anti-slavery cause. \"The millions of down-trodden\r\nslaves in our land,\" she says, \"being the greatest sufferers, the most\r\noppressed class, I have felt bound to plead their cause, in season and\r\nout of season, to endeavor to put my soul in their soul's stead, and to\r\naid, all in my power, in every right effort for their immediate\r\nemancipation.\" When in 1833, Wm. Lloyd Garrison took the ground of\r\nimmediate emancipation and urged the duty of unconditional liberty\r\nwithout expatriation, Mrs. Mott took an active part in the movement. She\r\nwas one of the founders of the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society\r\nin 1834. \"Being actively associated in the efforts for the slave's\r\nredemption,\" she says, \"I have traveled thousands of miles in this\r\ncountry, holding meetings in some of the slave states, have been in the\r\nmidst of mobs and violence, and have shared abundantly in the odium\r\nattached to the name of an uncompromising modern abolitionist, as well\r\nas partaken richly of the sweet return of peace attendant on those who\r\nwould 'undo the heavy burdens and let the oppressed go free, and break\r\nevery yoke.'\" In 1840 she attended the World's Anti-Slavery Convention\r\nin London. Because she was a woman she was not admitted as a delegate.\r\nAll the female delegates, however, were treated with courtesy, though\r\nnot with justice. Mrs. Mott spoke frequently in the liberal churches of\r\nEngland, and her influence outside of the Convention had great effect on\r\nthe Anti-Slavery movement in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nBut the value of Mrs. Mott's anti-slavery work is not limited to what\r\nshe individually did, great as that labor was. Her influence over\r\nothers, and especially the young, was extraordinary. She made many\r\nconverts, who went forth to spread the great ideas of freedom throughout\r\nthe land. No one can of himself accomplish great good. He must labor\r\nthrough others, he must inspire them, convince the unbelieving, kindle\r\nthe fires of faith in doubting souls, and in the unequal fight of Right\r\nwith Wrong make Hope take the place of despair. This Lucretia Mott has\r\ndone. Her example was an inspiration.\r\n\r\nIn the Temperance reform Mrs. Mott took an early interest, and for many\r\nyears she has practiced total abstinence from intoxicating drinks. In\r\nthe cause of Peace she has been ever active, believing in the \"ultra\r\nnon-resistance ground, that no Christian can consistently uphold and\r\nactively engage in and support a government based on the sword.\" Yet\r\nthis, we believe, did not prevent her from taking a profound interest in\r\nthe great war for the Union; though she deplored the means, her soul\r\nmust have exulted in the result. Through anguish and tears, blood and\r\ndeath America wrought out her salvation. Do we not believe that the\r\nUnited States leads the cause of human freedom? It follows then that the\r\nabolition of the gigantic system of human slavery in this country is the\r\ngrandest event in modern history. Mrs. Mott has also been earnestly\r\nengaged in aid of the working classes, and has labored effectively for\r\n\"a radical change in the system which makes the rich richer, and the\r\npoor poorer.\" In the Woman's Rights question she was early interested,\r\nand with Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, she organized, in 1848, a Woman's\r\nRights' Convention at Seneca Falls, New York. At the proceedings of this\r\nmeeting, \"the nation was convulsed with laughter.\" But who laughs now at\r\nthis irresistible reform?\r\n\r\nThe public career of Lucretia Mott is in perfect harmony with her\r\nprivate life. \"My life in the domestic sphere,\" she says, \"has passed\r\nmuch as that of other wives and mothers of this country. I have had six\r\nchildren. Not accustomed to resigning them to the care of a nurse, I was\r\nmuch confined to them during their infancy and childhood.\"\r\nNotwithstanding her devotion to public matters her private duties were\r\nnever neglected. Many of our readers will no doubt remember Mrs. Mott at\r\nAnti-slavery meetings, her mind intently fixed upon the proceedings,\r\nwhile her hands were as busily engaged in useful sewing or knitting. It\r\nis not our place to inquire too closely into this social circle, but we\r\nmay say that Mrs. Mott's history is a living proof that the highest\r\npublic duties may be reconciled with perfect fidelity to private\r\nresponsibilities. It is so with men, why should it be different with\r\nwomen?\r\n\r\nIn her marriage, Mrs. Mott was fortunate. James Mott was a worthy\r\npartner for such a woman. He was born in June, 1788, in Long Island. He\r\nwas an anti-slavery man, almost before such a thing as anti-slavery was\r\nknown. In 1812 he refused to use any article which was produced by slave\r\nlabor. The directors of that greatest of all railway corporations, the\r\nUnderground Rail Road, will never forget his services. He died, January\r\n26, 1868, having nearly completed his 80th year. \"Not only in regard to\r\nSlavery,\" said the \"Philadelphia Morning Post,\" at the time, \"but in all\r\nthings was Mr. Mott a reformer, and a radical, and while his principles\r\nwere absolute, and his opinions uncompromising, his nature was\r\nsingularly generous and humane. Charity was not to him a duty, but a\r\ndelight; and the benevolence, which, in most good men, has some touch of\r\nvanity or selfishness, always seemed in him pure, unconscious and\r\ndisinterested. His life was long and happy, and useful to his\r\nfellow-men. He had been married for fifty-seven years, and none of the\r\nmany friends of James and Lucretia Mott, need be told how much that\r\nunion meant, nor what sorrow comes with its end in this world.\" Mary\r\nGrew pronounced his fitting epitaph when she said: \"He was ever calm,\r\nsteadfast, and strong in the fore front of the conflict.\"\r\n\r\nIn her seventy-ninth year, the energy of Lucretia Mott is undiminished,\r\nand her soul is as ardent in the cause to which her life has been\r\ndevoted, as when in her youth she placed the will of a true woman\r\nagainst the impotence of prejudiced millions. With the abolition of\r\nSlavery, and the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, her greatest\r\nlife-work ended. Since then, she has given much of her time to the\r\nFemale Suffrage movement, and so late as November, 1871, she took an\r\nactive part in the Annual Meeting of the Pennsylvania Peace Society.\r\n\r\nSince the great law was enacted, which made all men, black or white,\r\nequal in political rights--as they were always equal in the sight of\r\nGod--Mrs. Mott has made it her business to visit every colored church in\r\nPhiladelphia. This we may regard as the formal closing of fifty years of\r\nwork in behalf of a race which she has seen raised from a position of\r\nabject servitude, to one higher than that of a monarch's throne. But\r\nthough she may have ended this Anti-slavery work, which is but the\r\nfoundation of the destiny of the colored race in America, her influence\r\nis not ended--_that_ cannot die; it must live and grow and deepen, and\r\ngenerations hence the world will be happier and better that Lucretia\r\nMott lived and labored for the good of all mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES MILLER McKIM.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore vividly than it is possible for the pen to portray, the subject of\r\nthis sketch recalls the struggles of the worst years of Slavery, when\r\nthe conflict was most exciting and interesting, when more minds were\r\naroused, and more laborers were hard at work in the field; when more\r\nanti-slavery speeches were made, tracts, papers, and books, were\r\nwritten, printed and distributed; when more petitions were signed for\r\nthe abolition of Slavery; in a word, when the barbarism of Slavery was\r\nmore exposed and condemned than ever before, in the same length of time.\r\nAbolitionists were then intensely in earnest, and determined never to\r\nhold their peace or cease their warfare, until _immediate_ and\r\n_unconditional_ emancipation was achieved.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, during this same period, it is not venturing too much\r\nto assert that the slave power was more oppressive than ever before;\r\nslave enactments more cruel; the spirit of Slavery more intolerant; the\r\nfetters more tightly drawn; perilous escapes more frequent; slave\r\ncaptures and slave hunts more appalling; in short, the enslavers of the\r\nrace had never before so defiantly assumed that negro Slavery was\r\nsanctioned by the Divine laws of God.\r\n\r\nThus, while these opposing agencies were hotly contesting the rights of\r\nman, James Miller McKim, as one of the earliest, most faithful, and\r\nablest abolitionists in Pennsylvania, occupied a position of influence,\r\nlabor and usefulness, scarcely second to Mr. Garrison.\r\n\r\nFor at least fourteen of the eventful years referred to, it was the\r\nwriter's privilege to occupy a position in the Anti-slavery office with\r\nMr. McKim, and the best opportunity was thus afforded to observe him\r\nunder all circumstances while battling for freedom. As a helper and\r\nfriend of the fleeing bondman, in numberless instances the writer has\r\nmarked well his kind and benevolent spirit, before and after the\r\nformation of the late Vigilance Committee. At all times when the funds\r\nwere inadequate, his aid could be counted upon for sure relief. He never\r\nfailed the fugitive in the hour of need. Whether on the Underground Rail\r\nRoad bound for Canada, or before a United States commissioner trying a\r\nfugitive case, the slave found no truer friend than Mr. McKim.\r\n\r\nIf the records of the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition\r\nof Slavery, and the Pennsylvania Anti-slavery Society were examined and\r\nwritten out by a pen, as competent as Mr. McKim's, two or three volumes\r\nof a most thrilling, interesting, and valuable character could be\r\nfurnished to posterity. But as his labors have been portrayed for these\r\npages, by a hand much more competent than the writer's, it only remains\r\nto present it as follows:\r\n\r\nThe subject of this sketch was born in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, November\r\n14, 1810, the oldest but one of eight children. On his father's side, he\r\nwas of Scotch Irish, on his mother's (Miller) of German descent. He\r\ngraduated at Dickinson College in 1828; and entering upon the study of\r\nmedicine, attended one or more courses of lectures in the University of\r\nPennsylvania. Before he was ready to take his degree, his mind was\r\npowerfully turned towards religion, and he relinquished medicine for the\r\nstudy of divinity, entering the Theological Seminary at Princeton, in\r\nthe fall of 1831, and a year later, being matriculated at Andover. The\r\ndeath of his parents, however, and subsequently that of his oldest\r\nbrother, made his connection with both these institutions a very brief\r\none, and he was obliged, as the charge of the family now devolved upon\r\nhim, to continue his studies privately at home, under the friendly\r\ndirection of the late Dr. Duffield. An ardent and pronounced disciple of\r\nthe \"New School\" of Presbyterians, belonging to a strongly Old School\r\nPresbytery; he was able to secure license and ordination only by\r\ntransfer to another; and, in October, 1835, he accepted a pulpit in\r\nWomelsdorf, Berks County, Pa., where he preached for one year, to a\r\nPresbyterian congregation, to what purpose, and with what views, may be\r\nlearned from the following passage taken from one of his letters,\r\nwritten more than twenty years afterwards, to the _National Anti-Slavery\r\nStandard_. \"The first settled pastor of this little flock was one\r\nsufficiently well-known to such of your readers as will be interested in\r\nthis, to make mention of his name unnecessary. He had studied for the\r\nministry with a strong desire, and a half formed purpose to become a\r\nmissionary in foreign lands. Before he had proceeded far in his studies,\r\nhowever, he became alive to the claims of the 'perishing heathen' here\r\nat home. When he received his licensure, his mind was divided between\r\nthe still felt impulse of his first purpose and the pressure of his\r\nlater convictions. While yet unsettled on this point, the case of the\r\nlittle church at Womelsdorf was made known to him, followed by an urgent\r\nrequest from the people and from the Home Missionary Society to take\r\ncharge of it. He acceded to the request and remained there one year,\r\nzealously performing the duties of his office to the best of his\r\nknowledge and ability. The people, earnest and simple-hearted, desired\r\nthe 'sincere milk of the Word,' and receiving it 'grew thereby.' All the\r\nmembers of the church became avowed abolitionists. They showed their\r\nfaith by their works, contributing liberally to the funds of the\r\nAnti-slavery Society. Many a seasonable donation has our Pennsylvania\r\norganization received from that quarter. For though their anti-slavery\r\nminister had left and had been followed by others of different\r\nsentiments and though he had withdrawn from the church with which they\r\nwere in common connected, and that on grounds which subjected him to the\r\nimputation and penalties af heresy, these good people did not feel\r\ncalled upon to change their relations of personal friendship, nor did\r\nthey make it a pretext, as others have done, for abandoning the cause.\"\r\n\r\nIn October, 1836, he accepted a lecturing agency under the American\r\nAnti-slavery Society, as one of the \"seventy,\" gathered from all\r\nprofessions, whom Theodore D. Weld had by his eloquence inspired to\r\nspread the gospel of emancipation. Mr. McKim had long before this had\r\nhis attention drawn to the subject of slavery, in the summer of 1832;\r\nand the reading of Garrison's \"Thoughts on Colonization,\" at once made\r\nhim an abolitionist. He was an appointed delegate to the Convention\r\nwhich formed the American Anti-slavery Society, and enjoyed the\r\ndistinction of being the youngest member of that body.[A] Henceforth the\r\nobject of the society, and of his ministry became inseparable in his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: It may be a matter of some interest to state that the\r\noriginal draft of the Declaration of Sentiments adopted at this meeting,\r\ntogether with the autographs of the signers, is now in the keeping of\r\nthe New York Historical Society.]\r\n\r\nIn the following summer, 1834, he delivered in Carlisle two addresses in\r\nfavor of immediate emancipation, which excited much discussion and\r\nbitter feeling in that border community, and gained him no little\r\nobloquy, which was of course increased when, as a lecturer, on the\r\nregular stipend of eight dollars a week and travelling expenses,\r\n(\"pocket lined with British gold\" was the current charge), he traversed\r\nhis native state, among a people in the closest geographical,\r\ncommercial, and social contact with the system of slavery. His fate was\r\nnot different from that of his colleagues, in respect of interruptions\r\nof his meetings by mob violence, personal assaults with stale eggs and\r\nother more dangerous missiles, and a public sentiment which everywhere\r\nencouraged and protected the rioters.\r\n\r\nMeantime, a radical change of opinion on theological questions, led Mr.\r\nMcKim formally to sever his connection with the Presbyterian Church, and\r\nministry. Being now free to act without sectarian constraint, he was, in\r\nthe beginning of 1840, made Publishing Agent of the Pennsylvania\r\nAnti-slavery Society, which caused him to settle in Philadelphia, where\r\nhe was married, in October, to Sarah A. Speakman, of Chester county. The\r\nchief duties of his office at first, were the publication and management\r\nof the _Pennsylvania Freeman_, including, for an interval after the\r\nretirement of John G. Whittier, the editorial conduct of that paper. In\r\ncourse of time his functions were enlarged, and under the title of\r\nCorresponding Secretary, he performed the part of a factotum and general\r\nmanager, with a share in all the anti-slavery work, local and national.\r\nAfter the consolidation of the _Freeman_ with the _Standard_, in 1854,\r\nhe became the official correspondent of the latter paper, his letters\r\nserving to some extent as a substitute for the discontinued _Freeman_.\r\nThe operations of the Underground Rail Road came under his review and\r\npartial control, as has already appeared in these pages, and the slave\r\ncases which came before the courts claimed a large share of his\r\nattention. After the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law, in 1851, his\r\nduties in this respect were arduous and various, as may be inferred from\r\none of his private letters to an English friend, which found its way\r\ninto print abroad, and which will be found in another place. (See p.\r\n581).\r\n\r\nDuring the John Brown excitement Mr. McKim had the privilege of\r\naccompanying Mrs. Brown in her melancholy errand to Harper's Ferry, to\r\ntake her last leave of her husband before his execution, and to bring\r\naway the body. His companions on that painful but memorable journey,\r\nwere his wife, and Hector Tyndale, Esq., afterwards honorably\r\ndistinguished in the war as General Tyndale. Returning with the body of\r\nthe hero and martyr, still in company with Mrs. Brown, Mr. McKim\r\nproceeded to North Elba, where he and Wendell Phillips, who had joined\r\nhim in New York with a few other friends gathered from the neighborhood,\r\nassisted in the final obsequies.\r\n\r\nWhen the war broke out, Mr. McKim was one of the first to welcome it as\r\nthe harbinger of the slave's deliverance, and the country's redemption.\r\n\"A righteous war,\" he said, \"is better than a corrupt peace.  *  *  *\r\nWhen war can only be averted by consenting to crime, then welcome war\r\nwith all its calamities.\" In the winter of 1862, after the capture of\r\nPort Royal, he procured the calling of a public meeting of the citizens\r\nof Philadelphia to consider and provide for the wants of the ten\r\nthousand slaves who had been suddenly liberated. One of the results of\r\nthis meeting was the organization of the Philadelphia Port Royal Relief\r\nCommittee. By request he visited the Sea Islands, accompanied by his\r\ndaughter, and on his return made a report which served his associates as\r\na basis of operations, and which was republished extensively in this\r\ncountry and abroad.\r\n\r\nAfter the proclamation of emancipation, he advocated an early\r\ndissolution of the anti-slavery organization, and at the May Meeting of\r\nthe American Anti-slavery Society, in 1864, introduced a proposition\r\nlooking to that result. It was favorably received by Mr. Garrison and\r\nothers, but no action was taken upon it at that time. When the question\r\ncame up the following year, the proposition to disband was earnestly\r\nsupported by Mr. Garrison, Mr. Quincy, Mr. May, Mr. Johnson, and others,\r\nbut was strongly opposed by Wendell Phillips and his friends, among whom\r\nfrom Philadelphia were Mrs. Mott, Miss Grew, and Robert Purvis, and was\r\ndecided by a vote in the negative.\r\n\r\nMr. McKim was an early advocate of colored enlistments, as a means of\r\nlifting up the blacks and putting down the rebellion. In the spring of\r\n1863, he urged upon the Philadelphia Union League, of which he was a\r\nmember, the duty of recruiting colored soldiers; as the result, on\r\nmotion of Thomas Webster, Esq., a movement was set on foot which led to\r\nthe organization of the Philadelphia Supervisory Committee, and the\r\nsubsequent establishment of Camp William Penn, with the addition to the\r\nnational army, of eleven colored regiments.\r\n\r\nWhen, in November, 1863, the Port Royal Relief Committee was enlarged\r\ninto the Pennsylvania Freedman's Relief Association, Mr. McKim was made\r\nits corresponding secretary. He had previously resigned his place in the\r\nAnti-slavery Society, believing that that organization was near the end\r\nof its usefulness.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMINENT ANTI-SLAVERY MEN\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. MILLER McKIM]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REV. WILLIAM H. FURNESS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEWIS TAPPAN]\r\n\r\nIn the freedmen's work, he traveled extensively, and worked hard,\r\nestablishing schools at the South and organizing public sentiment in the\r\nfree States. In the spring of 1865, he was made corresponding secretary\r\nof the American Freedman's Commission, which he had helped to establish,\r\nand took up his residence in the city of New York. This association was\r\nafterwards amplified, in name and scope, into the American Freedman's\r\nUnion Commission, and Mr. McKim continued with it as corresponding\r\nsecretary, laboring for reconstruction by means of Freedman's schools,\r\nand impartial popular education. On the 1st of July, 1869, the\r\nCommission, by unanimous vote on his motion, disbanded, and handed over\r\nthe funds in its treasury to its constituent State associations. Mr.\r\nMcKim retired from his labors with impaired health, and has since taken\r\nno open part in public affairs. He is one of the proprietors of the New\r\nYork _Nation_, in the establishment of which, he took an effective\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nMr. McKim's long and assiduous career in the anti-slavery cause, has\r\ngiven evidence of a peculiar fitness in him for the functions he\r\nsuccessively discharged. His influence upon men and the times, has been\r\nless as a speaker, than as a writer, and perhaps still less as a writer\r\nthan as an organizer, a contriver of ways and means; fertile in\r\ninvention, prepared to take the initiative, and bringing to the\r\nconversion of others, an earnestness of purpose and a force of language\r\nthat seldom failed of success. In an enterprise where theory and\r\nsentiment were fully represented, and business capacity, and what is\r\ncalled \"practical sense,\" were comparatively rare, his talents were most\r\nusefully employed; while, in periods of excitement--and when were such\r\nwanting? his caution, sound judgment, and mental balance were qualities\r\nhardly less needed or less important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM H. FURNESS, D.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the Abolitionists of Pennsylvania no man stands higher than Dr.\r\nFurness; and no anti-slavery minister enjoys more universal respect. For\r\nmore than thirty years he bore faithful witness for the black man; in\r\nseason and out of season contending for his rights. When others deserted\r\nthe cause he stood firm; when associates in the ministry were silent he\r\nspoke out. They defined their position by declaring themselves \"as much\r\nopposed to slavery as ever, but without sympathy for the abolitionists.\"\r\nHe defined his by showing himself more opposed to slavery than ever, and\r\nfraternizing with the most hated and despised anti-slavery people.\r\n\r\nDr. Furness came into the cause when it was in its infancy, and had few\r\nadherents. From that time till the day of its triumph he was one with\r\nit, sharing in all its trials and vicissitudes. In the operations of the\r\nVigilance Committee he took the liveliest interest. Though not in form a\r\nmember he was one of its chief co-laborers. He brought it material aid\r\ncontinually, and was one of its main reliances for outside support. His\r\nquick sympathies were easily touched and when touched were sure to\r\nprompt him to corresponding action. He would listen with moistened eyes\r\nto a tale of outrage, and go away saying never a word. But the story of\r\nwrong would work upon him; and through him upon others. His own feelings\r\nwere communicated to his friends, and his friends would send gifts to\r\nthe Committee's treasury. A wider spread sympathy would manifest itself\r\nin the community, and the general interests of the cause be visibly\r\npromoted. It was in the latter respect, that of moral co-operation, that\r\nDr. Furness's services were most valuable. After hearing a harrowing\r\nrecital, whether he would or not, it became the burden of his next\r\nSunday's sermon. Abundant proof of this may be found in his printed\r\ndiscourses. Take the following as an illustration. It is an extract from\r\na sermon delivered on the 29th of May, 1854, a period when the slave\r\noligarchy was at the height of its power and was supported at the North\r\nby the most violent demonstrations of sympathy. The text was, \"Feed my\r\nLambs:\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"And now brothers, sisters, children, give me your hearts,\r\n    listen with a will to what I have to say. As heaven is my\r\n    witness, I would not utter one word save for the dear love of\r\n    Christ and of God, and the salvation of your own souls. Does it\r\n    require any violent effort of the mind to suppose Christ to\r\n    address each one of us personally the same question that He put\r\n    to Peter, 'Lovest thou me?'  *  *  *  And at the hearing of His\r\n    brief command, 'Feed my lambs,' so simple, so direct, so\r\n    unqualified, are we prompted like the teacher of the law who,\r\n    when Christ bade him love his neighbor as himself, asked, 'And\r\n    who is my neighbor?' and in the parable of the good Samaritan,\r\n    received an answer that the Samaritans whom he despised, just as\r\n    we despise the African, was his neighbor, are we prompted in\r\n    like manner to ask, 'Who are the lambs of Christ?' Who are His\r\n    lambs? Behold that great multitude, more than three millions of\r\n    men and feeble women and children, wandering on our soil; no not\r\n    wandering, but chained down, not allowed to stir a step at their\r\n    own free will, crushed and hunted with all the power of one of\r\n    the mightiest nations that the world has yet seen, wielded to\r\n    keep them down in the depths of the deepest degradation into\r\n    which human beings can be plunged. These, then that we despise,\r\n    are our neighbors, the poor, stricken lambs of Christ.\r\n\r\n    To cast one thought towards them, may well cause us to bow down\r\n    our heads in the very dust with shame. No wonder that professing\r\n    to love Christ and his religion, we do not like to hear them\r\n    spoken of; for so far from feeding the lambs of Christ, we are\r\n    exciting the whole associated power of this land, to keep them\r\n    from being fed. 'Feed my lambs,' We might feed them with\r\n    fraternal sympathy, with hope, with freedom, the imperishable\r\n    bread of Heaven. We might lead them into green pastures and\r\n    still waters, into the glorious liberty wherewith Christ died to\r\n    make all men free, the liberty of the children of God. We might\r\n    secure to them the exercise of every sacred affection and\r\n    faculty, wherewith the Creator has endowed them. But we do none\r\n    of those things. We suffer this great flock of the Lord Jesus to\r\n    be treated as chattels, bought and sold, like beasts of burden,\r\n    hunted and lacerated by dogs and wolves. I say we, we of these\r\n    Free Northern communities, because it is by our allowance,\r\n    signified as effectually by silence, as by active co-operation,\r\n    that such things are. They could continue so, scarcely an hour,\r\n    were not the whole moral, religious and physical power of the\r\n    North pledged to their support. Are we not in closest league and\r\n    union with those who claim and use the right to buy and sell\r\n    human beings, God's poor, the lambs of Christ, a union, which we\r\n    imagine brings us in as much silver and gold as compensates for\r\n    the sacrifice of our humanity and manhood? Nay, are we not under\r\n    a law to do the base work of bloodhounds, hunting the panting\r\n    fugitives for freedom? I utter no word of denunciation. There is\r\n    no need. For facts that have occurred only within the last week,\r\n    transcend all denunciation. Only a few hours ago, there was a\r\n    man with his two sons, hurried back into the inhuman bondage,\r\n    from which they had just escaped, and that man, the brother, and\r\n    those two sons, the nephews of a colored clergyman of New York,\r\n    of such eminence in the New School Presbyterian Church, that he\r\n    has received the honors of a European University, and has acted\r\n    as Moderator in one of the Presbyteries of the same Church, when\r\n    held in the city where he resides. Almost at the very moment the\r\n    poor fugitive with his children, were dragged through our city,\r\n    the General Assembly of that very branch of the Presbyterian\r\n    Church, now in session here, after discussing for days the\r\n    validity of Roman Catholic baptism, threw out as inexpedient to\r\n    be discussed, the subject of that great wrong which was flinging\r\n    back into the agony of Slavery, a brother of one of their own\r\n    ordained ministers, and could not so much as breathe a word of\r\n    condemnation against the false and cruel deed which has just\r\n    been consummated at the capitol of the nation.\r\n\r\n    When such facts are occurring in the midst of us, we cannot be\r\n    guiltless concerning the lambs of Christ. It is we, we who make\r\n    up the public opinion of the North, we who consent that these\r\n    free States shall be the hunting-ground, where these, our poor\r\n    brothers and sisters, are the game; it is we that withhold from\r\n    them the bread of life, the inalienable rights of man. As we\r\n    withhold these blessings, so is it in our power to bestow them.\r\n    The sheep then that Christ commands us, as we love Him, to feed,\r\n    are those who are famishing for the lack of the food which it is\r\n    in our power to supply. And we can help to feed and relieve and\r\n    liberate them, by giving our hearty sympathy to the blessed\r\n    cause of their emancipation, to the abolition of the crying\r\n    injustice with which they are treated, by uttering our earnest\r\n    protest against the increasing and flagrant outrages of the\r\n    oppressor, by withholding all aid and countenance from the work\r\n    of oppression.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTo say that Dr. Furness, in his pleadings for the slave, was \"instant in\r\nseason and out of season,\" is not to exaggerate. So palpably was this\r\ntrue, that even some of his sympathizing friends intimated to him, that\r\nhis zeal carried him beyond proper bounds, and that his discourses were\r\nneedlessly reiterative. To these friends,--who, it is needless to say,\r\ndid not fully comprehend the breadth and bearing of the question,--he\r\nwould reply as he did in the following extract from a sermon delivered\r\nsoon after the one above quoted:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Again and again, I have had it said to me, with apparently the\r\n    most perfect simplicity, 'Why do you keep saying so much about\r\n    the slaves? Do you imagine that there is one among your hearers\r\n    who does not agree with you? We all know that Slavery is very\r\n    wrong. What, is the use of harping upon this subject Sunday\r\n    after Sunday? We all feel about it just as you do.' 'Feel about\r\n    it just as I do,' Very likely, my friends. It is very possible\r\n    that you all feel as much, and that many of you feel about it\r\n    more than I do. God knows that my regret always has been not\r\n    that I feel so much, but that I do not feel more. Would to\r\n    Heaven that neither you nor I could eat or sleep for pity, pity\r\n    for our poor down-trodden brothers and sisters. But the thing to\r\n    which I implore your attention now, is, not what we know and\r\n    feel, but the delusion which we are under, in confounding\r\n    _knowing_ with _doing_, in fancying that we are working to\r\n    abolish Slavery because we know that it is wrong. This is what I\r\n    would have you now to consider, the deception that we practise\r\n    on ourselves, the dangerous error into which we fall, when we\r\n    pass off the knowledge of our duty for the performance of it.\r\n    These are two very distinct things. If you know what is right,\r\n    happy are ye if ye do it.\r\n\r\n    Observe, my friends, what it is to which I am now entreating\r\n    your consideration. It is not the wrongs nor the rights of the\r\n    oppressed upon which I am now discoursing. It is our own\r\n    personal exposure to a most serious mistake. It is a danger,\r\n    which threatens our own souls, to which I would that our eyes\r\n    should be open and on the watch.\r\n\r\n    And here, by the way, let me say that one great reason why I\r\n    refer as often as I do, to that great topic of the day, which,\r\n    in one shape or another, is continually shaking the land and\r\n    marking the age in which we live, is not merely the righting of\r\n    the wronged, but the instruction, the moral enlightenment, the\r\n    religious edification of our own hearts, which this momentous\r\n    topic affords. To me this subject involves infinitely more than\r\n    a mere question of humanity. Its political bearing is the very\r\n    least and most superficial part of it, scarcely worth noticing\r\n    in comparison with its moral and religious relations. Once,\r\n    deterred by its outside, political aspect, I shunned it as many\r\n    do still, but the more it has pressed itself on my attention,\r\n    the more I have considered it--the more and more manifest has it\r\n    become to me, that it is a subject full of light and of\r\n    guidance, of warning and inspiration for the individual soul. It\r\n    is the most powerful means of grace and salvation appointed in\r\n    the providence of Heaven, for the present day and generation,\r\n    more religious than churches and Sabbaths. It is full of\r\n    sermons. It is a perfect gospel, a whole Bible of\r\n    mind-enlightening, heart-cleansing, soul-saving truth. How much\r\n    light has it thrown for me on the page of the New Testament!\r\n    What a profound significance has it disclosed in the precepts\r\n    and parables of Jesus Christ! How do His words burst out with a\r\n    new meaning! How does it help us to appreciate His trials and\r\n    the Godlike spirit with which He bore them!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dark winter of 1860 broke gloomily over all abolitionists; perhaps\r\nupon none did it press more heavily, than upon the small band in\r\nPhiladelphia. Situated as that city is, upon the very edge of Slavery,\r\nand socially bound as it was, by ties of blood or affinity with the\r\nslave-holders of the South, to all human foresight it would assuredly be\r\nthe first theatre of bloodshed in the coming deadly struggle. As Dr.\r\nFurness said in his sermon on old John Brown: \"Out of the grim cloud\r\nthat hangs over the South, a bolt has darted, and blood has flowed, and\r\nthe place where the lightning struck, is wild with fear.\" The return\r\nstroke we all felt must soon follow, and Philadelphia, we feared, would\r\nbe selected as the spot where Slavery would make its first mortal\r\nonslaught, and the abolitionists there, the first victims. Dr. Furness\r\nhad taken part in the public meeting held on the day of John Brown's\r\nexecution, to offer prayers for the heroic soul that was then passing\r\naway, and had gone with two or three others, to the rail-road station,\r\nto receive the martyr's body, when it was brought from the gallows by\r\nMr. (afterwards General) Tyndale and Mr. McKim, and it was generally\r\nfeared that he and his church would receive the brunt of Slavery's first\r\nblow. The air was thick with vague apprehension and rumor, so much so,\r\nthat some of Dr. Furness's devoted parishioners, who followed his\r\nabolitionism but not his non-resistance, came armed to church, uncertain\r\nwhat an hour might bring forth, or in what shape of mob violence or\r\nassassination the blow would fall. Few of Dr. Furness's hearers will\r\nforget his sermon of December 16, 1860, so full was it of prophetic\r\nwarning, and saddened by the thought of the fate which might be in store\r\nfor him and his congregation. It was printed in the \"Evening Bulletin,\"\r\nand made a deep impression on the public outside of his own church, and\r\nwas reprinted in full, in the Boston \"Atlas.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"But the trouble cannot be escaped. It must come. But we can put\r\n    it off. By annihilating free speech; by forbidding the utterance\r\n    of a word in the pulpit and by the press, for the rights of man;\r\n    by hurling back into the jaws of oppression, the fugitive\r\n    gasping for his sacred liberty; by recognizing the right of one\r\n    man to buy and sell other men; by spreading the blasting curse\r\n    of despotism over the whole soil of the nation, you may allay\r\n    the brutal frenzy of a handful of southern slave-masters; you\r\n    may win back the cotton States to cease from threatening you\r\n    with secession, and to plant their feet upon your necks, and so\r\n    evade the trouble that now menaces us. Then you may live on the\r\n    few years that are left you, and perhaps--it is not certain--we\r\n    may be permitted to make a little more money and die in our\r\n    beds. But no, friends, I am mistaken. We cannot put the trouble\r\n    off. Or, we put it off in its present shape, only that it may\r\n    take another and more terrible form. If, to get rid of the\r\n    present alarm, we concede all that makes it worth while to\r\n    live--and nothing less will avail--perhaps those who can\r\n    deliberately make such a concession, will not feel the\r\n    degradation, but, stripped of all honor and manhood, they may\r\n    eat as heartily and sleep as soundly as ever. But the\r\n    degradation is not the less, but the greater, for our\r\n    unconsciousness of it. The trouble which we shall then bring\r\n    upon ourselves, is a trouble in comparison with which the loss\r\n    of all things but honor is a glorious gain, and a violent death\r\n    for right's sake on the scaffold, or by the hands of a mob,\r\n    peace and joy and victory.\r\n\r\n    Since we are thus placed, and there is no alternative for us of\r\n    the free States, but to meet the trouble that is upon us, or by\r\n    base concessions and compromises to bring upon ourselves a far\r\n    greater trouble, in the name of God, let us let all things go,\r\n    and cleave to the right. Prepared to confront the crisis like\r\n    men, let us with all possible calmness endeavor to take the\r\n    measure of the calamity that we dread. God knows I have no\r\n    desire to make light of it. But I affirm, that never since the\r\n    world began, was there a grander cause for which to speak, to\r\n    suffer and to die, than the cause of these free States, as\r\n    against that of the States now rushing upon Secession. The great\r\n    grievance of which they complain, is nothing more nor less than\r\n    this: that we endanger the right they claim to treat human\r\n    beings as beasts of burden. And they maintain this monstrous\r\n    claim by measures inhuman and barbarous, listening not to the\r\n    voice of reason or humanity, but treating every man who goes\r\n    amongst them, suspected of not favoring their cause, or of the\r\n    remotest connection with others who do not favor it, with a most\r\n    savage and fiendish cruelty. It is the conflict between\r\n    barbarism and civilization, between liberty and the most\r\n    horrible despotism that ever cursed this earth, in which we are\r\n    called to take part.\r\n\r\n    And all that is great and noble in the past, all the patriots\r\n    and martyrs that have suffered in man's behalf, all the sacred\r\n    instincts and hopes of the human soul are on our side, and the\r\n    welfare of untold generations of men. Oh, if God, in his\r\n    infinite bounty, grants us the grace to appreciate the\r\n    transcendent worth of the cause which is now at stake, there is\r\n    no trouble that can befall us, no, not the loss of property, of\r\n    idolized parents or children, or life itself, that we shall not\r\n    count a blessed privilege. To serve this dear cause of peace and\r\n    liberty and love, we have no need to grasp the sword or any\r\n    instrument of violence and death. But we must be ready without\r\n    flinching, to confront the utmost that men can do, and amidst\r\n    all the uproar and violence of human passions, still calmly to\r\n    assert and to exercise our sacred and inalienable liberties, let\r\n    who will frown and forbid, assured that no just and\r\n    law-of-God-abiding people, will ever do otherwise than give us\r\n    their sympathy and their aid.\r\n\r\n    Death is the worst that can befall us, if so be that we are\r\n    faithful to the right. It is a solemn and a fearful thing to\r\n    die, and mortality shrinks from facing that last great mystery.\r\n    But we must all die, my friends, and the dying hour is not far\r\n    distant from the youngest of us. To most of us it is very near.\r\n    To many, only a few brief years remain. And for the sake of\r\n    these few and uncertain years, shall we push off this present\r\n    trouble upon our children, who have to stay here a little\r\n    longer? There is nothing that can so sweeten the bitter cup of\r\n    mortality when we shall be called to drink it, nothing that can\r\n    so cheer us in the prospect of parting from all we love, nothing\r\n    that can send such a blessed light on before us into the dark\r\n    valley which we must enter, as the consciousness of fidelity to\r\n    man and to God. And now in these times of great trouble which\r\n    have come upon us, we have a peculiar and special opportunity of\r\n    testifying our fidelity, and of enjoying a full experience of\r\n    its power to support us. We may gather from this trouble, a\r\n    sweetness that shall take away from all suffering its\r\n    bitterness. We may kindle that light in our bosoms, which shall\r\n    make death come to us as a radiant angel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFour months after the above was uttered, on the 28th of April, 1861,\r\nafter the attack on Fort Sumter, and the whole North had burst into a\r\nflame, people of all denominations flocked to Dr. Furness's church, as\r\nto that church which had shown that it was founded on a rock, and none\r\ncan ever forget the long-drawn breath with which the sermon began: \"The\r\nlong agony is over!\" It was the _\"Te Deum_\" of a life-time.\r\n\r\nDr. Furness's words and counsels were not wanting throughout the war,\r\nand his sermons were constantly printed in the daily press and in\r\nseparate pamphlet form. And since its close he has continued his\r\nabsorbing study of the historical accounts of Jesus.\r\n\r\nDr. Furncss was born in Boston, in April, 1802, and was graduated at\r\nHarvard, in 1820, and five years later became the minister of the First\r\nCongregational Unitarian Christians, in this city, and is consequently\r\nthe senior clergyman, here, on the score of length of pastorate.\r\n\r\nHappy is the man, and enviable the gospel minister, who, looking back\r\nupon his course in the great anti-slavery contest, can recall as the\r\nchief charge brought against him, that of being over-zealous! That he\r\nspoke too often and said too much in favor of the slave! There are but\r\nfew men, and still fewer ministers, who have a right to take comfort\r\nfrom such recollections! and yet it is to this small class that the\r\ncause is most indebted under God, for its triumph, and the country for\r\nits deliverance from Slavery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe character and career of the leader of the movement for immediate\r\nemancipation in this country, are too well known to be dwelt on here;\r\nnor, in the space at our command, is it possible to give in full those\r\nfacts of his life which have already appeared in print. His earliest\r\nbiographer was Mary Howitt; and another even more famous authoress, Mrs.\r\nH.B. Stowe, in \"Men of Our Times,\" has stood in the same relation to\r\nhim, while his life-long friend, Oliver Johnson, has writen the best\r\nconcise account of him, in \"Appleton's New American Cyclopædia.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Garrison (the Cyclopædia is, on this point, in error) was born\r\nDecember 12, 1804, in Newburyport, Mass., his father, Abijah Garrison,\r\nbeing a ship-captain, trading with the West Indies, and his mother,\r\nFanny Lloyd, a woman of remarkable beauty, as well as piety and force of\r\ncharacter. Intemperate habits led the husband and father from home to a\r\nsolitary and obscure end, leaving his family entirely dependent. William\r\n(or as he was always called, Lloyd), was the youngest but one of five\r\nchildren, and had not done with his schooling before he began to\r\ncontribute to his own support; at first in Lynn, where he was set at\r\nshoemaking, at the age of eleven; afterwards in Newburyport, and\r\nfinally, in 1818, at Haverhill, where he was apprenticed to a cabinet\r\nmaker. Not finding these trades suited to his taste, the same year he\r\nwas indentured to Ephraim W. Allen, editor of the \"_Newburyport\r\nHerald_,\" and in the printing-office he completed his education, so far\r\nas he was to have any, with such early success, as soon to be an\r\nacceptable contributor to his employer's paper, while the authorship of\r\nhis articles was still his own secret. As soon as his apprenticeship\r\ncame to a close, in 1826, he became proprietor of the \"_Free Press_,\" in\r\nhis native city, but the paper failed of support. Seeking work as a\r\njourneyman, in Boston, he was engaged in 1827 to edit, in the interest\r\nof \"total abstinence,\" the \"_National Philanthropist,\"_ the first paper\r\nof its kind ever published. On a change of proprietors in 1828, he was\r\ninduced to join a friend in Bennington, Vt., in publishing the \"_Journal\r\nof the Times_,\" which advocated the election of John Quincy Adams for\r\npresident, besides being devoted to peace, temperance, anti-slavery and\r\nother reforms. In this town, Mr. Garrison began his agitation of the\r\nsubject of Slavery, \"in consequence of which there was transmitted to\r\nCongress an anti-slavery memorial, more numerously signed than any\r\nsimilar paper previously submitted to that body.\" It was in Bennington,\r\ntoo, that he received from Benjamin Lundy, who had met him the previous\r\nyear at his boarding-house in Boston, an invitation to go to Baltimore,\r\nand aid him in editing the \"_Genius of Universal Emancipation_.\"\r\n\r\nBaltimore was no strange city to Mr. Garrison. Thither he had\r\naccompanied his mother, in 1815, serving as a chore-boy, and he had\r\nvisited her just before her death, in 1823. He took leave of Boston in\r\nthe fall of 1829, after having acted as the orator of the day, July 4th,\r\nin Park Street church, and surprised his hearers by the boldness of his\r\nutterances on the subject of Slavery. The causes of his imprisonment at\r\nBaltimore scarcely need to be repeated. For an alleged \"gross and\r\nmalicious libel\" on a townsman (of Newburyport) whose ship was engaged\r\nin the coastwise slave-trade, and whom he accordingly denounced in the\r\n\"_Genius_,\" he was tried and convicted, and sentenced to pay a fine of\r\n$50 and costs. The cell in which he was confined for forty-nine days,\r\nand from which he was liberated only by the spontaneous liberality of\r\nArthur Tappan, a perfect stranger to him, he had the satisfaction of\r\nreseeking, after the close of the war, in company with Judge Bond, but\r\nthe prison had been removed.\r\n\r\nCompelled to part company with Lundy, to whom he has ever owned his\r\nmoral indebtedness, Mr. Garrison at length started in Boston, in January\r\n1831, his \"_Liberator_\" with little else besides his \"dauntless spirit\r\nand a press.\" The difficulties which beset the birth of this paper were\r\nnever entirely overcome, and its publication was attended, through all\r\nthe thirty-five years of its existence, with constant struggle and\r\nprivation, and with personal labor, at the printer's case, and over the\r\nforms, which only an iron constitution could have endured. The\r\n\"_Liberator_\" was the organ of the editor alone, and he gave room in it\r\nto the numerous reforms which were, in his mind, only subordinate to\r\nabolition. In 1865 the last volume was issued, Mr. Garrison having\r\nalready, in May, withdrawn from the American Anti-slavery Society, which\r\nhe had helped to found, in 1833, and of which, as he drew up the\r\nDeclaration of Sentiments, he may be supposed to have known something of\r\nthe original aims and proper duration.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1834, Mr. Garrison was married to Helen Eliza, daughter of\r\nthe venerable philanthropist, George Benson, of Providence, R.I., who\r\nhad, even in the previous century, been an active member of a combined\r\nanti-slavery and freedmen's aid society in that city. In October, 1835,\r\noccurred the Boston riot, led by \"gentlemen of property and standing,\"\r\nin which Mr. Garrison's life was imperilled, and which made him once\r\nmore familiar with the interior of a jail--this time, a place of refuge.\r\nIn 1832, he went to England, as an agent of the New England Anti-slavery\r\nSociety, to awaken English sympathy for the anti-slavery movement, and\r\nto undeceive Clarkson and Wilberforce and their distinguished associates\r\nas to the nature and object of the Colonization Society, as to which he\r\nhad already had occasion to undeceive himself. His mission was eminently\r\nsuccessful in both its aspects, and resulted in the subsequent visits of\r\nGeorge Thompson to this country, between whom and himself a strong\r\npersonal attachment had arisen and has ever since continued. A second\r\nvisit to England he made as a delegate to the World's Anti-slavery\r\nConvention, in which he refused to sit after his female colleagues had\r\nbeen rejected. A third visit, still in behalf of the cause, took place\r\nin 1846. Twenty years later--the war over and Slavery abolished--he\r\nagain went abroad, to repair his health and renew old friendships, and\r\nfor the first time passed over to the Continent. In England, he was\r\ngreeted with cordial appreciation and hospitality by all classes.\r\nNumerous public receptions of a most flattering character were given to\r\nhim, but without the effect of causing him to magnify his own merits or\r\nto forget the honor due to his associates in the anti-slavery struggle.\r\nAt the London Breakfast, where John Bright presided, and John Stuart\r\nMill, the Duke of Argyll, and others spoke, he said, when called upon to\r\nreply: \"I disclaim, with all the sincerity of my soul, any special\r\npraise for anything I have done. I have simply tried to maintain the\r\nintegrity of my soul before God, and to do my duty.\" In Edinburgh, the\r\n\"freedom of the city\" was conferred upon him with impressive\r\nceremonies--he being the third American ever thus honored. In Paris he\r\nwas also received with distinction, his special mission to that city\r\nbeing to attend the International Anti-slavery Convention, in the\r\ncapacity of a delegate from the American Freedman's Union Commission, of\r\nwhich he was first vice-president.\r\n\r\nThe justice of the war on the part of the North, and its effect on the\r\nfate of Slavery at the South, were never subjects of doubt in the mind\r\nof Mr. Garrison, and he quickly recognized the force of events which had\r\ntaken from the abolitionists the helm of direction, and reunited them\r\nwith their countrymen in the irresistible flood which no man's hand\r\nguided, and no man's hand could stay. An agitator from conviction and\r\nnot from choice, he was only too glad to lay down the heavy burden of a\r\nlife-time, and retire to well-earned repose, after such a vision of\r\nfaint hope realized as certainly no other reformer was ever blessed\r\nwith. He had lived to see the disunion which he advocated on sacred\r\nprinciples, attempted by the South in the name of the sum of all\r\nvillanies; the uprising of the North; the grand career of Lincoln; the\r\nproclamation of emancipation; the arming of the blacks--his own son\r\namong their officers; the end of the rebellion; and the consummation of\r\nhis prayers and labors for the salvation of his country. He had taken\r\npart in the ceremonies at the recovery of Sumter, had walked the streets\r\nof Charleston, and received floral tokens of the gratitude of the\r\nemancipated. To him it seemed as if his work was done, and that he\r\nmight, without suspicion or accusation, cease to be conspicuous, or to\r\noccupy the public attention in any way relating to the past and\r\nrecalling his part in the anti-slavery struggle. Notoriety, no longer a\r\nnecessity, was eagerly avoided; and the physical rest which was now\r\nenjoined upon him the liberality of his friends having enabled him to\r\nsecure, he settled down into the quiet life of a private citizen, whose\r\ngreat duty had become to him merely one of the duties which every man\r\nowes his country and his race. His sweet temper, his modesty, his\r\nunfailing cheerfulness, his rarely mistaken judgment of men and\r\nmeasures; his blameless and happy domestic life, and his hospitality;\r\nhis warm sympathy with all forms of human suffering--these and other\r\nqualities which cannot be enumerated here, will doubtless receive the\r\njust judgment of posterity.\r\n\r\nAs a fitting adjunct to the foregoing sketch, extracts from some of the\r\nspeeches made at the London breakfast so magnanimously extended to Mr.\r\nGarrison in 1867, are here introduced. As presiding officer on the\r\noccasion, John Bright, M.P. spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH OF MR. BRIGHT, M.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    The position in which I am placed this morning is one very\r\n    unusual for me, and one that I find somewhat difficult; but I\r\n    consider it a signal distinction to be permitted to take a\r\n    prominent part in the proceedings of this day, which are\r\n    intended to commemorate one of the greatest of the great\r\n    triumphs of freedom, and to do honor to a most eminent\r\n    instrument in the achievement of that freedom. (Hear, hear.)\r\n    There may be, perhaps, those who ask what is this triumph of\r\n    which I speak? To put it briefly, and, indeed, only to put one\r\n    part of it, I may say that it is a triumph which has had the\r\n    effect of raising 4,000,000 of human beings from the very lowest\r\n    depths of social and political degradation to that lofty height\r\n    which men have attained when they possess equality of rights in\r\n    the first country on the globe. (Cheers.) More than this, it is\r\n    a triumph which has pronounced the irreversible doom of slavery\r\n    in all countries and for all time. (Renewed cheers.) Another\r\n    question suggests itself--how has this great matter been\r\n    accomplished? The answer suggests itself in another question.\r\n    How is it that any great matter is accomplished? By love of\r\n    justice, by constant devotion to a great cause, and by an\r\n    unfaltering faith that that which is right will in the end\r\n    succeed. (Hear, hear.)\r\n\r\n    When I look at this hall, filled with such an assembly; when I\r\n    partake of the sympathy which runs from heart to heart at this\r\n    moment in welcome to our guest of to-day, I cannot but contrast\r\n    his present position with that which, not so far back but that\r\n    many of us can remember, he occupied in his own country. It is\r\n    not forty years ago, I believe about the year 1829, when the\r\n    guest whom we honor this morning was spending his solitary days\r\n    in a prison in the slave-owning city of Baltimore. I will not\r\n    say that he was languishing in prison, for that I do not\r\n    believe; he was sustained by a hope that did not yield to the\r\n    persecution of those who thus maltreated him; and to show that\r\n    the effect of that imprisonment was of no avail to suppress or\r\n    extinguish his ardor, within two years after that he had the\r\n    courage, the audacity--I dare say many of his countrymen used\r\n    even a stronger phrase than that--he had the courage to commence\r\n    the publication, in the city of Boston, of a newspaper devoted\r\n    mainly to the question of the abolition of slavery. The first\r\n    number of that paper, issued on the 1st January, 1831, contained\r\n    an address to the public, one passage of which I have often read\r\n    with the greatest interest, and it is a key to the future life\r\n    of Mr. Garrison. He had been complained of for having used hard\r\n    language, which is a very common complaint indeed, and he said\r\n    in his first number: \"I am aware that many object to the\r\n    severity of my language, but is there not cause for such\r\n    severity? I will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as\r\n    justice. I am in earnest, I will not equivocate, I will not\r\n    excuse, I will not retract a single inch, and I will be heard\".\r\n    (Cheers.) And that, after all, expresses to a great extent the\r\n    future course of his life.\r\n\r\n    But what was at that time the temper of the people amongst whom\r\n    he lived, of the people who are glorying now, as they well may\r\n    glory, in the abolition of slavery throughout their country? At\r\n    that time it was very little better in the North than it was in\r\n    the South. I think it was in the year 1835 that riots of the\r\n    most serious character took place in some of the northern\r\n    cities; during that time Mr. Garrison's life was in the most\r\n    imminent peril; and he has never ascertained to this day how it\r\n    was that he was left alive on the earth to carry on his great\r\n    work. Turning to the South, a State that has lately suffered\r\n    from the ravages of armies, the State of Georgia, by its\r\n    legislature of House, Senate, and Governor, if my memory does\r\n    not deceive me, passed a bill, offering ten thousand dollars\r\n    reward, (Mr. Garrison here said five thousand) well, they seemed\r\n    to think there were people who would do it cheap, (laughter)\r\n    offered five thousand dollars, and zeal, doubtless, would make\r\n    up the difference, for the capture of Mr. Garrison, or for\r\n    adequate proof of his death. Now, these were menaces and perils\r\n    such as we have not in our time been accustomed to in this\r\n    country in any of our political movements, (hear, hear) and we\r\n    shall take a very poor measure indeed of the conduct of the\r\n    leaders of the emancipation party in the United States if we\r\n    estimate them by any of those who have been concerned in\r\n    political movements amongst us. But, notwithstanding all\r\n    drawbacks, the cause was gathering strength, and Mr. Garrison\r\n    found himself by and by surrounded by a small but increasing\r\n    band of men and women who were devoted to this cause, as he\r\n    himself was. We have in this country a very noble woman, who\r\n    taught the English people much upon this question, about thirty\r\n    years ago; I allude to Harriet Martineau. (Cheers.) I recollect\r\n    well the impression with which I read a most powerful and\r\n    touching paper which she had written, and which was published in\r\n    the number of the _Westminster Review_ for December, 1838. It\r\n    was entitled \"The Martyr Age of the United States.\" The paper\r\n    introduced to the English public the great names which were\r\n    appearing on the scene in connection with this cause in America.\r\n    There was, of course I need not mention, our eminent guest of\r\n    to-day; there was Arthur Tappan, and Lewis Tappan, and James G.\r\n    Birney of Alabama, a planter and slave-owner, who liberated his\r\n    slaves and came north, and became, as I think, the first\r\n    presidential candidate upon abolition principles in the United\r\n    States. (Hear, hear.) There were besides them, Dr. Channing,\r\n    John Quincy Adams, a statesman and President of the United\r\n    States, and father of the eminent man who is now Minister from\r\n    that people amongst us. (Cheers.) Then there was Wendell\r\n    Phillips, admitted to be by all who know him perhaps the most\r\n    powerful orator who speaks the English language. (Hear, hear.) I\r\n    might refer to others, to Charles Sumner, the well-known\r\n    statesman, and Horace Greeley, I think the first of journalists\r\n    in the United States, if not the first of journalists in the\r\n    world. (Hear, hear.) But besides these, there were of noble\r\n    women not a few. There was Lydia Maria Child; there were the two\r\n    sisters, Sarah and Angelina Grimke, ladies who came from South\r\n    Carolina, who liberated their slaves, and devoted all they had\r\n    to the service of this just cause; and Maria Weston Chapman, of\r\n    whom Miss Martineau speaks in terms which, though I do not\r\n    exactly recollect them, yet I know described her as\r\n    noble-minded, beautiful and good. It may be that there are some\r\n    of her family who are now within the sound of my voice. If it be\r\n    so, all I have to say is, that I hope they will feel, in\r\n    addition to all they have felt heretofore as to the character of\r\n    their mother, that we who are here can appreciate her services,\r\n    and the services of all who were united with her as co-operators\r\n    in this great and worthy cause. But there was another whose name\r\n    must not be forgotten, a man whose name must live for ever in\r\n    history, Elijah P. Lovejoy, who in the free State of Illinois\r\n    laid down his life for the cause. (Hear, hear.) When I read that\r\n    article by Harriet Martineau, and the description of those men\r\n    and women there given, I was led, I know not how, to think of a\r\n    very striking passage which I am sure must be familiar to most\r\n    here, because it is to be found in the Epistle to the Hebrews.\r\n    After the writer of that epistle has described the great men and\r\n    fathers of the nation, he says: \"Time would fail me to tell of\r\n    Gideon, of Barak, of Samson, of Jephtha, of David, of Samuel,\r\n    and the Prophets, who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought\r\n    righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,\r\n    quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword,\r\n    out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned\r\n    to flight the armies of the aliens.\" I ask if this grand passage\r\n    of the inspired writer may not be applied to that heroic band\r\n    who have made America the perpetual home of freedom?\r\n    (Enthusiastic cheering.)\r\n\r\n    Thus, in spite of all that persecution could do, opinion grew in\r\n    the North in favor of freedom; but in the South, alas! in favor\r\n    of that most devilish delusion that slavery was a Divine\r\n    institution. The moment that idea took possession of the South\r\n    war was inevitable. Neither fact nor argument, nor counsel, nor\r\n    philosophy, nor religion, could by any possibility affect the\r\n    discussion of the question when once the Church leaders of the\r\n    South had taught their people that slavery was a Divine\r\n    institution; for then they took their stand on other and\r\n    different, and what they in their blindness thought higher\r\n    grounds, and they said, \"Evil! be thou my good;\" and so they\r\n    exchanged light for darkness, and freedom for bondage, and good\r\n    for evil, and, if you like, heaven for hell.  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n    There was a universal feeling in the North that every care\r\n    should be taken of those who had so recently and marvellously\r\n    been enfranchised. Immediately we found that the privileges of\r\n    independent labor were open to them, schools were established in\r\n    which their sons might obtain an education that would raise them\r\n    to an intellectual position never reached by their fathers; and\r\n    at length full political rights were conferred upon those who a\r\n    few short years, or rather months, before, had been called\r\n    chattels, and things to be bought and sold in any market. (Hear,\r\n    hear.) And we may feel assured, that those persons in the\r\n    Northern States who befriended the negro in his bondage will not\r\n    now fail to assist his struggles for a higher position.  *  *  *\r\n    *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n    To Mr. Garrison more than any other man this is due; his is the\r\n    creation of that opinion which has made slavery hateful, and\r\n    which has made freedom possible in America. (Hear, hear.) His\r\n    name is venerated in his own country, venerated where not long\r\n    ago it was a name of obloquy and reproach. His name is venerated\r\n    in this country and in Europe wheresoever Christianity softens\r\n    the hearts and lessens the sorrows of men; and I venture to say\r\n    that in time to come, near or remote I know not, his name will\r\n    become the herald and the synonym of good to millions of men who\r\n    will dwell on the now almost unknown continent of Africa. (Loud\r\n    cheers.)  *  *  *\r\n\r\n    To Mr. Garrison, as is stated in one of the letters which has\r\n    just been read, to William Lloyd Garrison it has been given, in\r\n    a manner not often permitted to those who do great things of\r\n    this kind, to see the ripe fruit of his vast labors. Over a\r\n    territory large enough to make many realms, he has seen hopeless\r\n    toil supplanted by compensated industry; and where the bondman\r\n    dragged his chain, there freedom is established for ever. (Loud\r\n    cheers.) We now welcome him amongst us as a friend whom some of\r\n    us have known long; for I have watched his career with no common\r\n    interest, even when I was too young to take much part in public\r\n    affairs; and I have kept within my heart his name, and the names\r\n    of those who have been associated with him in every step which\r\n    he has taken; and in public debate in the halls of peace, and\r\n    even on the blood-soiled fields of war, my heart has always been\r\n    with those who were the friends of freedom. (Renewed cheering.)\r\n    We welcome him then with a cordiality which knows no stint and\r\n    no limit for him and for his noble associates, both men and\r\n    women.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this eloquent and able speech by the chairman, the honor of\r\nproposing an address to Mr. Garrison devolved upon the Duke of Argyll,\r\nwho introduced the subject in the following glowing speech:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH OF THE DUKE OF ARGYLL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    MR. CHAIRMAN, LADIES, AND GENTLEMEN:--It is hard to follow an\r\n    address of such extraordinary beauty, simplicity and power; but\r\n    it now becomes my duty at your command, sir, to move an address\r\n    of hearty congratulation to our distinguished guest, William\r\n    Lloyd Garrison. (Cheers.) Sir, this country is from time to time\r\n    honored by the presence of many distinguished, and of a few\r\n    illustrious men; but for the most part we are contented to\r\n    receive them with that private cordiality and hospitality with\r\n    which, I trust, we shall always receive strangers who visit our\r\n    shores. The people of this country are not pre-eminently an\r\n    emotional people; they are not naturally fond of public\r\n    demonstrations; and it is only upon rare occasions that we give,\r\n    or can give, such a reception as that we see here this day.\r\n    There must be something peculiar in the cause which a man has\r\n    served, in the service which he has rendered, and in our own\r\n    relations with the people whom he represents, to justify or to\r\n    account for such a reception. (Hear, hear.) As regards the\r\n    cause, it is not too much to say that the cause of negro\r\n    emancipation in the United States of America has been the\r\n    greatest cause which, in ancient or in modern times, has been\r\n    pleaded at the bar of the moral judgment of mankind. (Cheers.) I\r\n    know that to some this will sound as the language of exaggerated\r\n    feeling; but I can only say that I have expressed myself in\r\n    language which I believe conveys the literal truth. (Hear,\r\n    hear.)\r\n\r\n    I have, indeed, often heard it said in deprecation of the amount\r\n    of interest which was bestowed in this country on the cause of\r\n    negro emancipation in America, that we are apt to forget the\r\n    forms of suffering which are immediately at our own doors, over\r\n    which we have some control, and to express exaggerated feeling\r\n    as to the forms of suffering with which we have nothing to do,\r\n    and for which we are not responsible. I have never objected to\r\n    that language in so far as it might tend to recall us to the\r\n    duties which lie immediately around us, and in so far as it\r\n    might tend to make us feel the forgetfulness of which we are\r\n    sometimes guilty, of the misery and poverty in our own country;\r\n    but, on the other hand, I will never admit, for I think it would\r\n    be confounding great moral distinctions, that the miseries which\r\n    arise by way of natural consequence out of the poverty and the\r\n    vices of mankind, are to be compared with those miseries which\r\n    are the direct result of positive law and of a positive\r\n    institution, giving to man property in man. (Loud cheers.) It is\r\n    true, also, that there have been forms of servitude, meaning\r\n    thereby compulsory labor, against which we do not entertain the\r\n    same feelings of hostility and horror with which we have\r\n    regarded slavery in America.\r\n\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n    It was a system of which it may be truly said, that it was twice\r\n    cursed. It cursed him who served, and it cursed him that owned\r\n    the slave. (Hear, hear.) When we recollect the insuperable\r\n    temptations which that system held out to maintain in a state of\r\n    degradation and ignorance a whole race of mankind; the horrors\r\n    of the internal slave-trade, more widely demoralizing, in my\r\n    opinion, than the foreign slave-trade itself; the violence which\r\n    was done to the sanctities of domestic life; the corrupting\r\n    effect which it was having upon the very churches of\r\n    Christianity, when we recollect all these things, we can fully\r\n    estimate the evil from which my distinguished friend and his\r\n    coadjutors have at last redeemed their country. (Cheers.) It was\r\n    not only the Slave states which were concerned in the guilt of\r\n    slavery; it had struck its roots deep in the free States of\r\n    North America.  *  *  *\r\n\r\n    We honor Mr. Garrison, in the first place, for the immense pluck\r\n    and courage he displayed. (Cheers.) Sir, you have truly said\r\n    that there is no comparison between the contests in which he had\r\n    to fight and the most bitter contests of our own public life. In\r\n    looking back, no doubt, to the contest which was maintained in\r\n    this country some thirty-five years ago against slavery in our\r\n    colonies, we may recollect that Clarkson and Wilberforce were\r\n    denounced as fanatics, and had to encounter much opprobrium; but\r\n    it must not be forgotten that, so far as regards the entwining\r\n    of the roots of slavery into the social system, in the opinions\r\n    and interests of mankind, there was no comparison whatever\r\n    between the circumstances of that contest here and those which\r\n    attended it in America. (Hear, hear.) The number of persons who\r\n    in this country were enlisted on the side of slavery by personal\r\n    interest was always comparatively few; whilst, in attacking\r\n    slavery at its head-quarters in the United States, Mr. Garrison\r\n    had to encounter the fiercest passions which could be roused.  *\r\n    *  *  *\r\n\r\n    Thank God, Mr. Garrison appears before us as the representative\r\n    of the United States; freedom is now the policy of the\r\n    government and the assured policy of the country, and we can\r\n    to-day accept and welcome Mr. Garrison, not merely as the\r\n    liberator of the slaves, but as the representative also of the\r\n    American Government. (Cheers.)  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ADDRESS TO WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON, ESQ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"SIR:--We heartily welcome you to England in the name of\r\n    thousands of Englishmen who have watched with admiring sympathy\r\n    your labors for the redemption of the negro race from slavery,\r\n    and for that which is a higher object than the redemption of any\r\n    single race, the vindication of the universal principles of\r\n    humanity and justice; and who, having sympathized with you in\r\n    the struggle, now rejoice with you in the victory.\r\n\r\n    \"Forty years ago, when you commenced your efforts, slavery\r\n    appeared to be rapidly advancing to complete ascendency in\r\n    America. Not only was it dominant in the Southern States, but\r\n    even in the Free States it had bowed the constituencies,\r\n    society, and, in too many instances, even the churches to its\r\n    will. Commerce, linked to it by interest, lent it her support. A\r\n    great party, compactly organized and vigorously wielded, placed\r\n    in its hands the power of the state. It bestowed political\r\n    offices and honors, and was thereby enabled to command the\r\n    apostate homage of political ambition. Other nations felt the\r\n    prevalence in your national councils of its insolent and\r\n    domineering spirit. There was a moment, most critical in the\r\n    history of America and of the world, when it seemed as though\r\n    that continent, with all its resources and all its hopes, was\r\n    about to become the heritage of the slave power.\r\n\r\n    \"But Providence interposes to prevent the permanent triumph of\r\n    evil. It interposes, not visibly or by the thunderbolt, but by\r\n    inspiring and sustaining high moral effort and heroic lives.\r\n\r\n    \"You commenced your crusade against slavery in isolation, in\r\n    weakness, and in obscurity. The emissaries of authority with\r\n    difficulty found the office of the _Liberator_ in a mean room,\r\n    where its editor was aided only by a negro boy, and supported by\r\n    a few insignificant persons (so the officers termed them) of all\r\n    colors. You were denounced, persecuted, and hunted down by mobs\r\n    of wealthy men alarmed for the interests of their class. You\r\n    were led out by one of these mobs, and saved from their violence\r\n    and the imminent peril of death, almost by a miracle. You were\r\n    not turned from your path of devotion to your cause, and to the\r\n    highest interests of your country, by denunciation, persecution,\r\n    or the fear of death. You have lived to stand victorious and\r\n    honored in the very stronghold of slavery; to see the flag of\r\n    the republic, now truly free, replace the flag of slavery on\r\n    Fort Sumter; and to proclaim the doctrines of the _Liberator_ in\r\n    the city, and beside the grave of Calhoun.\r\n\r\n    \"Enemies of war, we most heartily wish, and doubt not that you\r\n    wish as heartily as we do, that this deliverance could have been\r\n    wrought out by peaceful means. But the fierce passions\r\n    engendered by slavery in the slaveowner, determined it\r\n    otherwise; and we feel at liberty to rejoice, since the struggle\r\n    was inevitable, that its issue has been the preservation, not\r\n    the extinction, of all that we hold most dear. We are, however,\r\n    not more thankful for the victories of freedom in the field than\r\n    for the moderation and mercy shown by the victors, which have\r\n    exalted and hallowed their cause and ours in the eyes of all\r\n    nations.\r\n\r\n    \"We shall now watch with anxious hope the development, amidst\r\n    the difficulties which still beset the regeneration of the\r\n    South, of a happier order of things in the States rescued from\r\n    slavery, and the growth of free communities, in which your name,\r\n    with the names of your fellow-workers in the same cause, will be\r\n    held in grateful and lasting remembrance.\r\n\r\n    \"Once more we welcome you to a country in which you will find\r\n    many sincere admirers and warm friends.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEARL RUSSELL and JOHN STUART MILL, M.P., at the close of the address,\r\nfollowed with most eloquent speeches, conferring on the honored guest\r\nthe highest praise for his life-long and successful labors in the cause\r\nof freedom. After these gentlemen had taken their seats, the Chairman\r\nproposed that the address should be passed unanimously.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman's call was responded to by the whole assemblage lifting up\r\ntheir hands; and Mr. Garrison, presenting himself in front of the\r\nplatform, was received with an enthusiastic burst of cheering, hats and\r\nhandkerchiefs being waved by nearly all present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH OF MR. GARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Garrison said:--Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen,--For\r\n    this marked expression of your personal respect, and\r\n    appreciation of my labors in the cause of human freedom, and of\r\n    your esteem and friendship for the land of my nativity, I offer\r\n    you, one and all, my grateful acknowledgments. But I am so\r\n    profoundly impressed by the formidable array of rank, genius,\r\n    intellect, scholarship, and moral and religious worth which I\r\n    see before me, that I fear I shall not be able to address you,\r\n    except with a fluttering pulse and a stammering tongue. For me\r\n    this is, indeed, an anomalous position. Assuredly, this is\r\n    treatment with which I have not been familiar. For more than\r\n    thirty years, I had to look the fierce and unrelenting hostility\r\n    of my countrymen in the face, with few to cheer me onward. In\r\n    all the South I was an outlaw, and could not have gone there,\r\n    though an American citizen guiltless of wrong, and though that\r\n    flag (here the speaker pointed to the United States ensign) had\r\n    been over my head, except at the peril of my life; nay, with the\r\n    certainty of finding a bloody grave. (Hear, hear.) In all the\r\n    North I was looked upon with hatred and contempt. The whole\r\n    nation, subjugated to the awful power of slavery, rose up in\r\n    mobocratic tumult against any and every effort to liberate the\r\n    millions held in bondage on its soil. And yet I demanded nothing\r\n    that was not perfectly just and reasonable, in exact accordance\r\n    with the Declaration of American Independence and the Golden\r\n    Rule. I was not the enemy of any man living. I cherish no\r\n    personal enmities; I know nothing of them in my heart. Even\r\n    whilst the Southern slave-holders were seeking my destruction, I\r\n    never for a moment entertained any other feeling toward them\r\n    than an earnest desire, under God, to deliver them from a deadly\r\n    curse and an awful sin. (Hear, hear.) It was neither a sectional\r\n    nor a personal matter at all. It had exclusive reference to the\r\n    eternal law of justice between man and man, and the rights of\r\n    human nature itself.\r\n\r\n    Sir, I always found in America that a shower of brickbats had a\r\n    remarkably tonic effect, materially strengthening to the\r\n    back-bone. (Laughter.) But, sir, the shower of compliments and\r\n    applause, which has greeted me on this occasion would assuredly\r\n    cause my heart to fail me, were it not that this generous\r\n    reception is only incidentally personal to myself. (Hear, hear.)\r\n    You, ladies and gentlemen, are here mainly to celebrate the\r\n    triumph of humanity over its most brutal foes; to rejoice that\r\n    universal emancipation has at last been proclaimed throughout\r\n    the United States: and to express, as you have already done\r\n    through the mouths of the eloquent speakers who have preceded\r\n    me, sentiments of peace and of good-will toward the American\r\n    Republic. Sure I am that these sentiments will be heartily\r\n    reciprocated by my countrymen. (Cheers.)\r\n\r\n    I must here disclaim, with all sincerity of soul, any special\r\n    praise for anything that I have done. I have simply tried to\r\n    maintain the integrity of my soul before God, and to do my duty.\r\n    (Cheers.) I have refused to go with the multitude to do evil. I\r\n    have endeavored to save my country from ruin. I have sought to\r\n    liberate such as were held captive in the house of bondage. But\r\n    all this I ought to have done.\r\n\r\n    And now, rejoicing here with you at the marvellous change which\r\n    has taken place across the Atlantic, I am unable to express the\r\n    satisfaction I feel in believing that, henceforth, my country\r\n    will be a mighty power for good in the world. While she held a\r\n    seventh portion of her vast population in a state of chattelism,\r\n    it was in vain that she boasted of her democratic principles and\r\n    her free institutions; ostentatiously holding her Declaration of\r\n    Independence in one hand, and brutally wielding her\r\n    slave-driving lash in the other. Marvellous inconsistency and\r\n    unparalleled assurance. But now, God be praised, she is free,\r\n    free to advance the cause of liberty throughout the world. (Loud\r\n    cheers.)\r\n\r\n    Sir, this is not the first time I have been in England. I have\r\n    been here three times before on anti-slavery missions; and\r\n    wherever I traveled, I was always exultantly told, \"Slaves\r\n    cannot breathe in England!\" Now, at last, I am at liberty to\r\n    say, and I came over with the purpose to say it, \"Slaves cannot\r\n    breathe in America!\" (Cheers.) And so England and America stand\r\n    side by side in the cause of negro emancipation; and side by\r\n    side may they stand in all that is just and noble and good,\r\n    leading the way gloriously in the world's redemption. (Loud\r\n    cheers.)\r\n\r\n    I came to this country for the first time in 1833, to undeceive\r\n    Wilberforce, Clarkson, and other eminent philanthropists, in\r\n    regard to the real character, tendency, and object of the\r\n    American Colonization Society. I am happy to say that I quickly\r\n    succeeded in doing so. Before leaving, I had the pleasure of\r\n    receiving a protest against that Society as an obstruction to\r\n    the cause of freedom throughout the world, and, consequently, as\r\n    undeserving of British confidence and patronage, signed by\r\n    William Wilberforce, Thomas Fowell Buxton, Zachary Macaulay, and\r\n    other illustrious philanthropists. On arriving in London I\r\n    received a polite invitation by letter from Mr. Buxton to take\r\n    breakfast with him. Presenting myself at the appointed time,\r\n    when my name was announced, instead of coming forward promptly\r\n    to take me by the hand, he scrutinized me from head to foot, and\r\n    then inquired, somewhat dubiously, \"Have I the pleasure of\r\n    addressing Mr. Garrison, of Boston, in the United States?\" \"Yes,\r\n    sir,\" I replied, \"I am he; and I am here in accordance with your\r\n    invitation.\" Lifting up his hands he exclaimed, \"Why, my dear\r\n    sir, I thought you were a black man. And I have consequently\r\n    invited this company of ladies and gentlemen to be present to\r\n    welcome Mr. Garrison, the black advocate of emancipation from\r\n    the United States of America.\" (Laughter.) I have often said,\r\n    sir, that that is the only compliment I have ever had paid to me\r\n    that I care to remember or tell of. For Mr. Buxton had somehow\r\n    or other supposed that no white American could plead for those\r\n    in bondage as I had done, and therefore I must be black.\r\n    (Laughter.)\r\n\r\n    It is indeed true, sir, that I have had no other rule by which\r\n    to be guided than this. I never cared to know precisely how many\r\n    stripes were inflicted on the slaves. I never deemed it\r\n    necessary to go down into the Southern States, if I could have\r\n    gone, for the purpose of taking the exact dimensions of the\r\n    slave system. I made it from the start, and always, my own case,\r\n    thus: Did I want to be a slave? No. Did God make me to be a\r\n    slave? No. But I am only a man, only one of the human race; and\r\n    if not created to be a slave, then no other human being was made\r\n    for that purpose. My wife and children, dearer to me than my\r\n    heart's blood, were they made for the auction-block? Never! And\r\n    so it was all very easily settled here (pointing to his breast).\r\n    (Great cheering.) I could not help being an uncompromising\r\n    abolitionist.\r\n\r\n    Here allow me to pay a brief tribute to the American\r\n    abolitionists. Putting myself entirely out of the question, I\r\n    believe that in no land, at any time, was there ever a more\r\n    devoted, self-sacrificing, and uncompromising band of men and\r\n    women. Nothing can be said to their credit which they do not\r\n    deserve. With apostolic zeal, they counted nothing dear to them\r\n    for the sake of the slave, and him dehumanized. But whatever has\r\n    been achieved through them is all of God, to whom alone is the\r\n    glory due. Thankful are we all that we have been permitted to\r\n    live to see this day, for our country's sake, and for the sake\r\n    of mankind. Of course, we are glad that our reproach is at last\r\n    taken away; for it is very desirable, if possible, to have the\r\n    good opinions of our fellow-men; but if, to secure these, we\r\n    must sell our manhood and sully our souls, then their bad\r\n    opinions of us are to be coveted instead.\r\n\r\n    Sir, my special part in this grand struggle was in first\r\n    unfurling the banner of immediate and unconditional\r\n    emancipation, and attempting to make a common rally under it.\r\n    This I did, not in a free State, but in the city of Baltimore,\r\n    in the slave-holding State of Maryland. It was not long before I\r\n    was arrested, tried, condemned by a packed jury, and\r\n    incarcerated in prison for my anti-slavery sentiments. This was\r\n    in 1830. In 1864 I went to Baltimore for the first time since my\r\n    imprisonment. I do not think that I could have gone at an\r\n    earlier period, except at the peril of my life; and then only\r\n    because the American Government was there in force, holding the\r\n    rebel elements in subserviency. I was naturally curious to see\r\n    the old prison again, and, if possible, to get into my old cell;\r\n    but when I went to the spot, behold! the prison had vanished;\r\n    and so I was greatly disappointed, (Laughter.) On going to\r\n    Washington, I mentioned to President Lincoln, the disappointment\r\n    I had met with. With a smiling countenance and a ready wit, he\r\n    replied, \"So, Mr. Garrison, the difference between 1830 and 1864\r\n    appears to be this: in 1830 you could not get out, and in 1864\r\n    you could not get in!\" (Great laughter.) This was not only\r\n    wittily said, but it truthfully indicated the wonderful\r\n    revolution that had taken place in Maryland; for she had adopted\r\n    the very doctrine for which she imprisoned me, and given\r\n    immediate and unconditional emancipation to her eighty thousand\r\n    slaves. (Cheers.)\r\n\r\n    I commenced the publication of the \"_Liberator_\" in Boston, on\r\n    the 1st of January, 1831. At that time I was very little known,\r\n    without allies, without means, without subscribers; yet no\r\n    sooner did that little sheet make its appearance, than the South\r\n    was thrown into convulsions, as if it had suddenly been invaded\r\n    by an army with banners! Notwithstanding, the whole country was\r\n    on the side of the slave power--the Church, the State, all\r\n    parties, all denominations, ready to do its bidding! O the\r\n    potency of truth, and the inherent weakness and conscious\r\n    insecurity of great wrong! Immediately a reward of five thousand\r\n    dollars was offered for my apprehension, by the State of\r\n    Georgia. When General Sherman was making his victorious march\r\n    through that State, it occurred to me, but too late, that I\r\n    ought to have accompanied him, and in person claimed the\r\n    reward--(laughter)--but I remembered, that, had I done so, I\r\n    should have had to take my pay in Confederate currency, and\r\n    therefore it would not have paid traveling expenses. (Renewed\r\n    laughter.) Where is Southern Slavery now? (Cheers.) Henceforth,\r\n    through all coming time, advocates of justice and friends of\r\n    reform, be not discouraged; for you will, and you must succeed,\r\n    if you have a righteous cause. No matter at the outset how few\r\n    may be disposed to rally round the standard you have raised--if\r\n    you battle unflinchingly and without compromise--if yours be a\r\n    faith that cannot be shaken, because it is linked to the Eternal\r\n    Throne--it is only a question of time when victory shall come to\r\n    reward your toils. Seemingly, no system of iniquity was ever\r\n    more strongly intrenched, or more sure and absolute in its sway,\r\n    than that of American Slavery; yet it has perished.\r\n\r\n      \"In the earthquake God has spoken;\r\n        He has smitten with His thunder\r\n        The iron walls asunder,\r\n      And the gates of brass are broken.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    So it has been, so it is, so it ever will be throughout the\r\n    earth, in every conflict for the right. (Great cheering.)  *  *\r\n    *  *  *\r\n\r\n    Ladies and gentlemen, I began my advocacy of the Anti-slavery\r\n    cause at the North in the midst of brickbats and rotten eggs. I\r\n    ended it on the soil of South Carolina, almost literally buried\r\n    beneath the wreaths and flowers which were heaped upon me by her\r\n    liberal bondmen. (Cheers.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEWIS TAPPAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Was one of the warmest friends of the slave and of the colored\r\n    man. He was very solicitous for their welfare, and that the\r\n    colored people who were free should be enlightened and educated.\r\n    He opened a Sunday-school for colored adults, which was\r\n    numerously attended, in West Broadway, New York, and with a few\r\n    others, devoted the most of the Sabbath to their teaching. When\r\n    he and his brother Arthur, assembled the seventy anti-slavery\r\n    agents, who were thereafter, like \"firebrands,\" scattered all\r\n    over the land, they held their meetings in this room. These\r\n    agents were entertained by abolitionists in the city, and many\r\n    of us had two or three of them in each of our families for a\r\n    couple of weeks. They went out all over the land, and were\r\n    instrumental in diffusing more truth, perhaps, about the\r\n    dreadful system of American Slavery, than was accomplished in\r\n    any other way. He also aided in establishing several\r\n    periodicals, brimful of anti-slavery truth; among which, were\r\n    the \"_Anti-Slavery Record_,\" the \"_Emancipator_,\" the \"_Slave's\r\n    Friend;_\" the latter, to indoctrinate the children in\r\n    Anti-slavery. The American Missionary Society, originally begun\r\n    for the support of a mission in Africa, on the occasion of the\r\n    return of the Amistad captors to their native land, and now\r\n    doing so much for the freedmen of the South, was almost entirely\r\n    established by his efforts. During the continuance of Slavery,\r\n    much was done by this Society for the diffusion of an\r\n    anti-slavery gospel.\r\n\r\n    The \"Vigilance Committee,\" for aiding and befriending fugitives,\r\n    of which I was treasurer for many years, had no better or warmer\r\n    friend than he. He was almost always at their meetings, which\r\n    were known only to \"the elect,\" for we dared not hold them too\r\n    publicly, as we almost always had some of the travelers toward\r\n    the \"north star\" present, whose masters or their agents were\r\n    frequently in the city, in hot pursuit. At first, we sent them\r\n    to Canada, but after a while, sent them only to Syracuse, and\r\n    the centre of the State.\r\n\r\n    In 1834, I think, was the first rioting, the sacking of Mr.\r\n    Tappan's house, in Rose Street. The mob brought all his\r\n    furniture out, and piling it up in the street, set it on fire.\r\n    The family were absent at the time. Soon after, they stoned Rev.\r\n    Mr. Ludlow's, and Dr. Cox's church, and the house of the latter.\r\n    They threatened Arthur Tappan & Co's, store, in Pearl Street,\r\n    but hearing that there were a few loaded muskets there, they\r\n    _took it out in threats_. But their mercantile establishment was\r\n    almost ostracised at this time, by the dry goods merchants; and\r\n    country merchants in all parts of the country, north as well as\r\n    south, did not dare to have it known that they bought goods of\r\n    them; and when they did so, requested particularly, that the\r\n    bundles or boxes, should not be marked \"from A. Tappan & Co.,\"\r\n    as was customary. Southern merchants especially, avoided them,\r\n    and when, two or three years later, there was a general\r\n    insolvency among them, occasionally large losses to New York\r\n    merchants, and in some cases failure; _the Tappans were saved by\r\n    having no Southern debts_!\r\n\r\n    Through Mr. Tappan's influence and extensive correspondence\r\n    abroad, many remittances came for the help of the \"Vigilance\r\n    Committee,\" from England and Scotland, and at one time, an\r\n    extensive invoice of useful and fancy articles, in several large\r\n    boxes, was received from the Glasgow ladies, sufficient to\r\n    furnish a large bazaar or fair, which was held in Brooklyn, for\r\n    the benefit of the Committee.\r\n\r\n    Although lately afflicted by disease, Mr. Tappan still lives in\r\n    the enjoyment of all his faculties, and a good measure of\r\n    health, and in his advanced years, sees now some of the great\r\n    results of his life-long efforts for the restoration and\r\n    maintenance of human rights.\r\n\r\n    Although still suffering under many of the evils which Slavery\r\n    has inflicted upon him, the _American slave_ no longer exists!\r\n    Instead stands up in all our Southern States the _freedman_,\r\n    knowing his rights, and, as a rule, enjoying them. Original\r\n    American abolitionists, who met the scorn and odium, the imputed\r\n    shame and obloquy, the frowns and cold-shoulders which they bore\r\n    through all the dark days of Slavery, now see and feel their\r\n    reward in some measure; to be completed only, when they shall\r\n    hear the plaudit: \"Inasmuch as ye have done it to the least of\r\n    these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\"\r\n\r\n    ANTHONY LANE.\r\n\r\n    New York, Nov. 8, 1871.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Lane, Mr. Tappan's personal friend who labored with him in the\r\nAnti-Slavery Cause, and especially in the Vigilance Committee for many\r\nyears, from serious affection of his eyes was not prepared to furnish as\r\nfull a sketch of his (Mr. T.'s) labors as was desirable. Mr. Tappan was,\r\ntherefore, requested to furnish a few reminiscences from his own\r\nstore-house, which he kindly did as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    WILLIAM STILL, ESQ., My dear Sir:--In answer to your request,\r\n    that I would furnish, an article for your forthcoming book,\r\n    giving incidents within my personal knowledge, relating to the\r\n    Underground Rail Road; I have already apprized you of my illness\r\n    and my consequent inability to write such an article as would be\r\n    worthy of your publication. However, feeling somewhat relieved\r\n    to-day, from my paralysis, owing to the cheering sunshine and\r\n    the favor of my Almighty Preserver, I will try to do what I can,\r\n    in dictating a few anecdotes to my amanuensis, which may afford\r\n    you and your readers some gratification.\r\n\r\n    These facts I must give without reference to date, as I will not\r\n    tax my memory with perhaps a vain attempt to narrate them in\r\n    order.\r\n\r\n    As mentioned in my \"Life of Arthur Tappan,\" some abolitionists\r\n    (myself among the number), doubted the propriety of engaging in\r\n    such measures as were contemplated by the conductors of the\r\n    \"Underground Rail Road,\" fearing that they would not be\r\n    justified in aiding slaves to escape from their masters; but\r\n    reflection convinced them that it was not only right to assist\r\n    men in efforts to obtain their liberty, when unjustly held in\r\n    bondage, but a DUTY.\r\n\r\n    Abolitionists, white and colored, both in slave and free States,\r\n    entered into extensive correspondence, set their wits at work to\r\n    devise various expedients for the relief from bondage and\r\n    transmission to the free States and to Canada, of many of the\r\n    most enterprising bondmen and bondwomen. They vied with each\r\n    other in devising means for the accomplishment of this object.\r\n    Those who had money contributed it freely, and those who were\r\n    destitute of money, gave their time, saying with the Apostle:\r\n    \"Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have, give I thee.\"\r\n\r\n    1. I recollect that one morning on reaching my office (that of\r\n    the treasurer of the American Missionary Association), my\r\n    assistant told me that in the inner room were eighteen\r\n    fugitives, men, women and children, who had arrived that morning\r\n    from the South in one company. On going into the room, I saw\r\n    them lying about on the bales and boxes of clothing destined for\r\n    our various missionary stations, fatigued, as they doubtless\r\n    were, after their sleepless and protracted struggle for freedom.\r\n\r\n    On inquiry, I learned that they had come from a southern city.\r\n    After most extraordinary efforts, it seemed that they had while\r\n    in Slavery, secretly banded together, and put themselves under\r\n    the guidance of an intrepid conductor, whom they had hired to\r\n    conduct them without the limits of the city, in the evening,\r\n    when the police force was changed. They came through\r\n    Pennsylvania and New Jersey to my office. The agent of the\r\n    Underground Rail Road in New York, took charge of them, and\r\n    forwarded them to Albany, and by different agencies to Canada.\r\n\r\n    2. I well remember that one morning as I entered the\r\n    Sabbath-school,[A] one of the scholars, a Mrs. Mercy Smith,\r\n    beckoned to me to come to her class, and there introduced to me\r\n    a young girl of about fifteen, as a fugitive, who had arrived\r\n    the day before. In answer to my inquiries, this girl told me the\r\n    name of the southern city, and the names of the persons who had\r\n    held her as a slave, and the mode of her escape, etc. \"I was\r\n    walking near the water,\" she said, \"when a white sailor spoke to\r\n    me, and after a few questions, offered to hide me on board his\r\n    vessel and conduct me safely to New York, if I would come to him\r\n    in the evening. I did so, and was hid and fed by him, and on\r\n    landing at New York, he conducted me to Mrs. Smith's house,\r\n    where I am now staying.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote A: For three years I superintended a Sabbath-school\r\n    mostly composed of colored children and adults. Most of the\r\n    teachers were warm-hearted abolitionists, and the whole number\r\n    taught in this school during this period, was seven or eight\r\n    hundred.]\r\n\r\n    To my inquiry, have you parents living, and also brothers and\r\n    sisters, she replied: \"There is no child but myself.\" \"Were not\r\n    your parents kind to you, and did you not love them?\" \"Yes I\r\n    love them very much.\"\r\n\r\n    \"How were you treated by your master and mistress?\" \"They\r\n    treated me very well.\" \"How then,\" said I, \"could you put\r\n    yourself in the care of that sailor, who was a stranger to you,\r\n    and leave your parents?\" I shall never forget her heart-felt\r\n    reply: \"_He told me I should be free_!\"\r\n\r\n    One Sunday morning, I received a letter, informing me that an\r\n    officer belonging to Savannah, Ga., had started for New York, in\r\n    pursuit of two young men, of nineteen or twenty, who had been\r\n    slaves of one of the principal physicians of the place, and who\r\n    had escaped and were supposed to be in New York. The letter\r\n    requested me to find them and give them warning. As there was no\r\n    time to be lost, I concluded to go over to New York,\r\n    notwithstanding the doubtfulness of attempting to find them in\r\n    so large a city. I wrote notices to be read in the colored\r\n    churches and colored Sabbath-schools, which I delivered in\r\n    person. I then went to the colored school, superintended by Rev.\r\n    C.B. Bay. I stated my errand to him, with a description of the\r\n    young men. \"Why,\" said he, \"I must have one of them in my\r\n    school.\" He took me to a class where I found one of the young\r\n    men, to whom I gave the needful information.\r\n\r\n    He told me that his father was Dr. ---- of Savannah, and that he\r\n    had five children by the young man's mother, who was his slave.\r\n    On his marriage to a white woman, he sent his five colored\r\n    children and their mother to auction, to be sold for cash to the\r\n    highest bidder. On being put upon the auction-block, this young\r\n    man addressed the bystanders, and told them the circumstances of\r\n    the case; that his mother had long lived in the family of the\r\n    doctor, that it was cruel to sell her and her children, and he\r\n    warned the people not to bid for him, for he would no longer be\r\n    a slave to any man, and if any one bought him, he would lose his\r\n    money. He added, \"I thought it right to say this.\" I then spoke\r\n    to the crowd. \"My father,\" said I, \"has long been one of your\r\n    first doctors, and do you think it right for him to sell my\r\n    mother and his children in this way?\"\r\n\r\n    \"I was sold, and my brother also, and the rest, although my\r\n    brother said to the crowd what I had said. We soon made our\r\n    escape, and are now both in the city. I am a blacksmith, and\r\n    have worked six months in one shop, in New York, with white\r\n    journeymen, not one of whom believes, I suppose, that I am a\r\n    colored man.\"\r\n\r\n    It was not surprising, for so fair was his complexion, that with\r\n    the aid of a brown wig, after he had cut off his hair, he was\r\n    completely disguised. He soon notified his brother, who lived in\r\n    another part of the city, and both put themselves out of harm's\r\n    way. They were remarkably fine young men, and it seemed a\r\n    special Providence that I should find them in such a large city,\r\n    and direct them to escape from their pursuer, within one hour\r\n    after I left my house in Brooklyn. I felt it to be an answer to\r\n    prayer.\r\n\r\n    4. One day, when I lived in New York City, a colored man came\r\n    running to my house, and in a hurried manner, said: \"Is this Mr.\r\n    Tappan?\" On replying in the affirmative, he said: \"I have driven\r\n    my master from Baltimore. He has just arrived, and the servants\r\n    are taking off the baggage at the Astor House. I inquired of a\r\n    person passing by, where you lived. He said, 80, White Street,\r\n    and I have run here, to tell you that you may give notice to a\r\n    man who has escaped from my master, to this city, that the\r\n    object of this journey is to find him and take him back to\r\n    Slavery.\"\r\n\r\n    The man hurried back, so that he need not be missed by his\r\n    master, who believed that this coachman, who had lived years\r\n    with him, was his confidential servant, and would be true to his\r\n    interest.\r\n\r\n    I went immediately to the house of a colored friend, to describe\r\n    the fugitive and see if we could not concert measures to protect\r\n    him. \"I think,\" said he, \"that I know the man, by your\r\n    description, and that he boards in this house. He will soon come\r\n    in from South Street, where he has worked to-day.\" While we were\r\n    consulting together, sure enough, the man came in, and was most\r\n    glad to have the opportunity thus afforded, of secreting\r\n    himself.\r\n\r\n    I have not strength to dictate much more, although many other\r\n    instances occur to me of most remarkable providential\r\n    occurrences, of the escape of fugitives within my knowledge. I\r\n    used to say that I was the owner of _half-a-horse_ that was in\r\n    active service, near the Susquehanna River. This horse I owned\r\n    jointly with another friend of the slave, dedicating the animal\r\n    to the service of the Underground Rail Road.\r\n\r\n    It was customary for the agent at Havre de Grace, bringing a\r\n    fugitive to the river, to kindle a fire (as it was generally in\r\n    the night), to give notice to a person living on the opposite\r\n    side of the river. This person well understood the signal, and\r\n    would come across in his boat and receive the fugitive.\r\n\r\n    An aged colored couple, residing in Brooklyn, came over to my\r\n    office, in New York City, and said that they had just heard from\r\n    Wilmington, N.C., that their two sons (about twenty-five or\r\n    twenty-six years of age), who were slaves, were about to be\r\n    sold, for one thousand dollars each; and they hoped I should be\r\n    able and willing to assist them in raising the money.\r\n\r\n    I told them that I had scruples about putting money into the\r\n    hands of slave-holders, but I would give them something that\r\n    might be of as much value. I then pointed out a way by which\r\n    their sons might reach the city.\r\n\r\n    In about three weeks, one of the young men came to my office.\r\n    Give me, said I, some particulars of your escape. \"I am,\" said\r\n    he, \"a builder, and planned and erected the hotel at Wilmington,\r\n    and some other houses. I used to hire my time of my master, and\r\n    was accustomed to ride about the country attending to my\r\n    business. I borrowed a pass from a man about my size and\r\n    complexion. I then went to the rail road office, and asked for a\r\n    ticket for Fredericksburg. From there I came on directly to\r\n    Washington. I had not been questioned before; but here, I was\r\n    taken up and carried before a magistrate. He examined me by the\r\n    description in my pass; complexion, height, etc., then read\r\n    '_and a scar under his left knee_.' When I heard that, my heart\r\n    sank within me; for I had no scar there that I knew. 'Pull up\r\n    the boy's trowsers,' said the justice to the constable. He did\r\n    so. and said 'here's a scar!' 'All right,' said the justice, 'no\r\n    mistake, let him go.' Glad was I. I got a ticket for Baltimore,\r\n    and there for another town, and finally reached here.\"\r\n\r\n    You asked me to give an account of the sums that I have expended\r\n    for the Underground Rail Road, etc. I must be excused from doing\r\n    this, as if I could now ascertain, I should not think it worth\r\n    while to mention. I must now conclude my narrative, by giving,\r\n    with some additions, an account of an interesting escape from\r\n    Slavery, which was written by my wife, more than fifteen years\r\n    ago, for Frederic Douglass' paper.\r\n\r\n    [On page 177 the narrative of \"The Fleeing Girl of Fifteen\" is\r\n    so fully written out, that it precludes the necessity of\r\n    reproducing a large portion of this story.]\r\n\r\n    In the evening a friend arrived, bringing with him a bright,\r\n    handsome _boy_, whom he called Joe. Most heartily was \"Joe\"\r\n    welcomed, and deep was the thrill which we felt, as we looked\r\n    upon him and thought of the perils he had escaped. The next day\r\n    was Thanksgiving-day, and my house was thronged with guests. In\r\n    an upper room, with a comfortable fire, and the door locked, sat\r\n    \"Joe,\" still in boy's clothes, to be able to escape at the first\r\n    intimation of danger, but with a smile and look of touching\r\n    gratitude, whenever any one of the family who was in the secret,\r\n    left the festive group to look in upon the interesting stranger.\r\n    Not one of us can ever forget the deep abhorrence of Slavery,\r\n    and thanksgiving to Almighty God, that we felt that day as we\r\n    moved among the guests, who were wholly ignorant of the occupant\r\n    of that upper room. Some curiosity was indeed excited among the\r\n    little grandchildren, who saw slices of turkey and plum pudding\r\n    sent up stairs. It was \"Joe's\" first Thanksgiving dinner in a\r\n    free State.\r\n\r\n    As she brought nothing away with her, it was necessary, the next\r\n    day, to procure a complete wardrobe for a girl, which was\r\n    carefully packed for her to take with her.\r\n\r\n    The second day after \"Joe's\" arrival, the Rev. Mr. Freeman,\r\n    pastor of a colored church in Brooklyn, agreed to accompany her\r\n    to her uncle Brown's in Canada West, and we saw them depart,\r\n    knowing the danger that would beset both on the way. The\r\n    following is part of a letter from Mr. F., giving an account of\r\n    their journey. After stating that they left New York, in the\r\n    cars at five o'clock, P.M., and through the providence of God,\r\n    went on their way safely and speedily, with none to molest or to\r\n    make them afraid, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"On reaching Rochester, I began to ask myself 'how shall\r\n        we get over Niagara Falls?' I was not sure that the cars\r\n        ran across the Suspension Bridge; besides, I felt that\r\n        we were in more danger here, than we had been at any\r\n        other place. Knowing that there was a large reward\r\n        offered for Joe's apprehension, I feared there might be\r\n        some lurking spy ready to pounce upon us. But when we\r\n        arrived at the Bridge, the conductor said: 'Sit still;\r\n        this car goes across.' You may judge of my joy and\r\n        relief of mind, when I looked out and was sure that we\r\n        were over! Thank God, I exclaimed, we are safe in\r\n        Canada!\r\n\r\n        Having now a few minutes before the cars would start\r\n        again, I sat down and hastily wrote a few lines, to\r\n        inform friends at home of our safe arrival. As soon as\r\n        possible, I ran to the post-office with my letter, paid\r\n        the postage, and while I was waiting for my change, the\r\n        car bell rang. I quickly returned, and in a few minutes,\r\n        we were on our way to Chatham (200 miles West). That\r\n        place we reached between seven and eight o'clock,\r\n        Saturday evening. When we got out, we met a gentleman\r\n        who asked me if I wanted a boarding-house. I said yes;\r\n        and he invited me to go with him. I asked him if there\r\n        was any way for us to get to Dresden that night. He\r\n        answered, 'No, it is a dark night, and a muddy road, and\r\n        no conveyance can be got tonight.' I soon found that we\r\n        must stay in Chatham until Monday morning.\r\n\r\n        On our way to the boarding-house, the gentleman said to\r\n        me: 'Is this your son with you?' I answered, no; and\r\n        then I asked him, if he knew a man living in D., by the\r\n        name of Bradley. He replied that he was very well\r\n        acquainted with him, and then inquired if that young man\r\n        was Mr. Bradley's brother. I said, no--not exactly a\r\n        brother. He must have thought it strange that I did not\r\n        give him a more definite answer to his question.\r\n\r\n        When we reached the house, we found several boarders in\r\n        the sitting-room and a few neighbors. I had already told\r\n        him my name, but with regard to Joe, I had not yet had a\r\n        chance to explain. I, of course, was introduced to those\r\n        who were in the room, but Joe--well, Joe took a seat,\r\n        and did not seem to be troubled about an introduction.\r\n        As the landlord was going out of the room, I asked\r\n        permission to speak with him alone. He took me into\r\n        another room, and I said to him: 'That young man, as you\r\n        call him, is a young woman, and has come dressed in this\r\n        manner, all the way from Washington City. She would be\r\n        very glad now to be able to change her clothes.'\r\n\r\n        He was greatly surprised, and would hardly believe that\r\n        it was so; but said, 'I will call my wife.' She came,\r\n        and I guess all the women in the house came with her.\r\n        They soon disappeared, and Joe with them, who, after\r\n        being absent a while, returned, and was introduced as\r\n        Miss Ann Maria Weems. The whole company were on their\r\n        feet, shook hands, laughed, and rejoiced, declaring that\r\n        this beat all they had ever seen before. Chatham\r\n        contains, I was told, more than three thousand\r\n        fugitives. The weather there, is not colder than in New\r\n        York.\r\n\r\n        The next morning was the Sabbath, but this I must pass\r\n        and hasten to D., the residence of Mr. Bradley. We\r\n        started early Monday morning. As a part of the road was\r\n        very bad, we did not reach there till a late hour. As we\r\n        were passing along, and getting near to the place, we\r\n        met two colored men who were talking together--one on\r\n        horseback, and the other on foot. I inquired of them, if\r\n        they could tell me how far it was to Mr. Bradley's. The\r\n        man on horseback said it was about a mile further, and\r\n        then proceeded to give directions. After he had done\r\n        this, he said: 'I reckon I am the one that you want to\r\n        find, my name is Bradley.' Well, I replied, probably you\r\n        are the man. Just then Ann Maria turned her head around.\r\n        As soon as he saw her face, he exclaimed: 'My Lord!\r\n        Maria, is that you? Is that you? My child, is it you? We\r\n        never expected to see you again! We had given you up; O,\r\n        what will your aunt say? It will kill her! She will die!\r\n        It will kill her.'\r\n\r\n        I told him, that as I was obliged to leave again soon, I\r\n        must proceed. 'Well,' said he, 'you go on; I am just\r\n        going over to M., and will be back in a few minutes.' We\r\n        started for his house, and he towards M., but we had\r\n        only gone a short distance, when he overtook us,\r\n        exclaiming: 'I can't go to M.,' and began talking to Ann\r\n        Maria, asking her all about her friends and relatives,\r\n        whom they had left behind, and about his old master, and\r\n        his wife's master, from whom they had run away four\r\n        years before. As we approached the house, he said: 'I\r\n        will go and open the gate, and have a good fire to warm\r\n        you.' When he came up to the gate, he met his wife, who\r\n        was returning from a store or neighbor's house, and he\r\n        said to her, 'That's Ann Maria coming yonder.' She\r\n        stopped until we came to the gate; the tears were\r\n        rolling from her eyes, and she exclaimed: 'Ann Maria, is\r\n        it you?' The girl leaped from the wagon, and they fell\r\n        on each other's necks, weeping and rejoicing. Such a\r\n        scene I never before witnessed. She, who had been given\r\n        up as lost, was now found! She, who but a short time\r\n        before, had been, as they supposed, a slave for life,\r\n        was now free.\r\n\r\n        We soon entered the house, and after the first gush of\r\n        feeling had somewhat subsided, they both began a general\r\n        inquiry about the friends they had left behind. Every\r\n        now and then, the aunt would break out: 'My child, you\r\n        are here! Thank God, you are free! We were talking about\r\n        you today, and saying, we shall never see you again; and\r\n        now here you are with us.' I remained about an hour and\r\n        a half with them, took dinner, and then started for\r\n        home, rejoicing that I had been to a land where colored\r\n        men are free.\r\n\r\n        This Mr. Bradley, who ran away with himself and wife\r\n        about four years ago from the land of whips and chains,\r\n        is the owner of two farms, and is said to be worth three\r\n        thousand dollars. Can slaves take care of themselves?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    You may well suppose that the receipt of this letter gave us\r\n    great pleasure, and called forth heartfelt thanksgiving to Him,\r\n    who had watched over this undertaking, and protected all\r\n    concerned in it. A bright and promising girl had been rescued\r\n    from the untold miseries of a slave woman's life, and found a\r\n    good home, where she would have an opportunity to acquire an\r\n    education and be trained for a useful and happy life. Mr.\r\n    Bradley intended to send for her parents, and hoped to prevail\r\n    on them to come and live with him.\r\n\r\n    Truly yours,\r\n\r\n    LEWIS TAPPAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIJAH F. PENNYPACKER,\r\n\r\n\r\nWhose name belongs to the history of the Underground Rail Road, owed his\r\npeculiarly fine nature to a mother of large physical proportions, and\r\ncorrespondingly liberal mental and spiritual endowments. She was a\r\nnatural sovereign in the sphere in which she moved, and impressed her\r\nson with the qualities which made his Anti-slavery life nothing but an\r\nexpression of the rules of conduct which governed him in all other\r\nparticulars. Believing in his inmost soul in principles of rectitude,\r\nall men believed in him, his \"yea,\" or \"nay,\" passing current wherever\r\nhe went. Tall, dignified, and commanding, he had that in his face which\r\ninspired immediate confidence. Said one who looked: \"If that is not a\r\ngood man, there is no use in the Lord writing His signature on human\r\ncountenances.\" Even in early youth, honors which he never sought, were\r\npressed upon him, as he gave assurance of ability commensurate with his\r\nworth. He was sent to the Legislature of Pennsylvania for five sessions,\r\nwhere he became the personal friend of the Governor, Joseph Ritner, and\r\nalso of Thaddeus Stevens. At the request of the latter, he consented to\r\noccupy the position of Secretary to the Board of Canal Commissioners,\r\nand two years after, by the wishes of Mr. Ritner, took a seat in the\r\nCanal Board, becoming a co-worker with Thaddeus Stevens. Here ripened a\r\nfriendship, which afterward became of national importance, for although\r\na nature so positive as that of Thaddeus Stevens could scarcely be said\r\nto be under the influence of any other mind, still, if there were those\r\nwho exercised a moral sway, sustaining this courageous republican\r\nleader, at a higher level than he might otherwise have attained, Elijah\r\nF. Pennypacker was surely amongst them. Almost antipodal as they were in\r\ncertain respects, each recognized the genuine ring of the other, and\r\nadmired and respected that which was most true and noble. The purity,\r\nsimplicity and high-minded honor which distinguished the younger, had\r\nits effect on the elder, even while he smiled at the inflexibility which\r\nwould not swerve one hair's breadth from the line of right. The story is\r\noften told, how, when this young man's conscience stood bolt upright in\r\nthe way of what was deemed a desirable arrangement, Stevens one day\r\nexclaimed: \"It don't do, Pennypacker, to be so d----d honest.\"\r\nPennypacker stood his ground, and the life-long respect which Stevens\r\never after awarded, proved that _he_ at least, thought it _did_ do.\r\n\r\nWhen it became clear to his mind, that a great battle was to be fought\r\nbetween Liberty and Slavery in America, Mr. Pennypacker felt it to be\r\nhis duty to turn aside from the sunny paths of political preferment,\r\ninto the shadows of obscure life, and ally himself with the\r\nmisrepresented, despised and outcast Abolitionists, ever after devoting\r\nhimself assiduously to the promotion of the cause of Freedom.\r\nNotwithstanding his natural modesty, here as elsewhere, he took a\r\nconspicuous position. At home, in the local Anti-slavery Society of his\r\nneighborhood, he was for many years chosen president, as he was also of\r\nthe Chester county Anti-slavery Society, and of the Pennsylvania State\r\nAnti-slavery Society.\r\n\r\nSoon after his retirement from public life, he united himself with the\r\nSociety of Friends, but was much too radical to be an acceptable\r\naddition. For a long time he was endured rather than endorsed, and it\r\nwas only when such anti-slavery feelings as he cherished became\r\ngenerally diffused throughout the Society, that he found the unity he\r\ndesired and expected. Whatever may have been his trials here or\r\nelsewhere, he found a rich reward for his faithfulness in the\r\nintellectual and moral growth which he attained by association with the\r\nmost advanced minds of the time, and he has often been heard to say that\r\nno part of his life has been more fully and generously compensated than\r\nthat devoted to the Anti-slavery cause.\r\n\r\nHis home, near Phoenixville, Chester county, Pa., was an important\r\nstation on the Underground Rail Road, the majority of fugitives\r\nproceeding through the southern rural districts of Eastern Pennsylvania,\r\npassing through his hands. At all times he was deeply interested in\r\ntheir welfare, and in his hospitality towards them, had the entire\r\nsympathy and co-operation of his family, they, like himself, being\r\nearnest abolitionists, but his more important duty of influencing public\r\nsentiment in favor of freedom, overshadowed his labors in this\r\ndepartment. In steadfastness and integrity he stood beside Findley\r\nCoates and Thomas Whitson, a trio who will long be remembered in their\r\nnative State.\r\n\r\nSo long as Dr. B. Fussell resided in the northern section of Chester\r\ncounty, he and Elijah F. Pennypacker, were companions in Anti-slavery\r\nand other reform labors, as well as in business on the Underground Rail\r\nRoad. Differing widely in temperament and mental structure, these two\r\nmen were harmonious in spirit, and a close bond of sympathy and\r\naffection existed between them. It was a mutual pleasure to work as\r\nbrothers, and afterward to rejoice together in labor accomplished. One\r\nof the last visits which roused the flickering animation of the dying\r\nphysician, was from this friend of more vigorous years, and the voice\r\nwhich gave fitting expression to the worth of the departed, at his\r\nfuneral, was that of Elijah F. Pennypacker.\r\n\r\nLike that of the highest grade of men everywhere, his appreciation of\r\nwoman has ever been keen and true, and demanding the full rights of\r\nhumanity, he makes no distinction, either on account of sex or color. In\r\nhis own family, he has always encouraged the pursuit of any occupation\r\ncongenial to the person choosing it; whether or not, it were a departure\r\nfrom the routine of custom, and in educational advantages he has ever\r\ndemanded the widest possible culture for all. Wherever known, he is\r\nestimated as a pillar in the temperance cause. Gentle, modest, courteous\r\nand benignant, he combines, in a remarkable degree, strength and\r\ntenderness, courage and sympathy. At one time, holding at bay the powers\r\nof evil and baffling the most determined opponents by his manly\r\nadherence to right; at another he may be found yielding to impressions\r\nbidding him to seek the source of some hidden private sorrow, and with\r\ndelicate touch, binding up a flowing wound, or offering himself as the\r\ndefender and protector of such as may need his brotherly care. Obedient\r\nto these impressions, he rarely errs in his ministrations, and whether\r\nhis errand be to remonstrate with the evil doer, setting his sins\r\nclearly and vividly before him, or to strengthen and encourage suffering\r\ninnocence, he is alike successful. Men, whom he has warned in reproof\r\nwhen it cost the utmost bravery to do so, have become his confiding\r\nfriends, and have been known afterward to entrust him with heavy\r\npecuniary responsibilities, and to point him out to their children as an\r\nexample worthy of imitation. Those whose griefs he has frequently\r\nsoftened, have laid upon his head a crown of blessing whiter than the\r\nhonors which come with his silver hairs, and all with whom he comes in\r\ncontact in business, in duty, or in social intercourse, acknowledge the\r\npresence, the wide usefulness and influence of the upright man.\r\n\r\nThe memories of the choice spirits he used to meet in the Anti-slavery\r\ngatherings; their mutual and kindly greetings; the holy resolves which\r\nanimated them and made the time hours of exaltation, now serve to\r\nbrighten the pathway of his declining years, and to throw a halo around\r\nthe restfulness of his home, as in peace of mind he looks abroad over\r\nhis beloved country, to see millions of enfranchised men beginning to\r\navail themselves of its pecuniary, educational and political advantages,\r\nand beholds them starting on a career of material and spiritual\r\nprosperity, with a rapidity commensurate with the expansive force of the\r\nrepressed energies of a race.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATION MASTERS ON THE ROAD.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELIJAH F. PENNYPACKER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM WRIGHT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. BARTHOLOMEW FUSSELL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBERT PURVIS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Wright, a distinguished abolitionist of Adams county,\r\nPennsylvania, was born on the 21st of December, 1788. Various\r\ncircumstances conspired to make this unassuming Quaker an earnest\r\nAbolitionist and champion of the oppressed in every land and of every\r\nnationality and color. His uncle, Benjamin Wright, and cousin, Samuel B.\r\nWright, were active members of the old Pennsylvania Abolition Society,\r\nand at the time of the emancipation of the slaves in this state were\r\noften engaged in lawsuits with slave-holders to compel them to release\r\ntheir bondmen, according to the requirements of the law. William Wright\r\ngrew up under the influence of the teachings of these relatives. Joined\r\nto this, his location caused him to take an extraordinary interest in\r\nUnderground Rail Road affairs. He lived near the foot of the southern\r\nslope of the South Mountain, a spur of the Alleghenies which extends,\r\nunder various names, to Chattanooga, Tennessee. This mountain was\r\nfollowed in its course by hundreds of fugitives until they got into\r\nPennsylvania, and were directed to William Wright's house.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1817, William Wright married Phebe Wierman, (born on the\r\n8th of February, 1790,) daughter of a neighboring farmer, and sister of\r\nHannah W. Gibbons, wife of Daniel Gibbons, a notice of whom appears\r\nelsewhere in this work. Phebe Wright was the assistant of her husband in\r\nevery good work, and their married life of forty-eight years was a long\r\nperiod of united and efficient labor in the cause of humanity. She still\r\n(1871) survives him. William and Phebe Wright began their Underground\r\nRail Road labors about the year 1819. Hamilton Moore, who ran away from\r\nBaltimore county, Maryland, was the first slave aided by them. His\r\nmaster came for him, but William Wright and Joel Wierman, Phebe Wright's\r\nbrother, who lived in the neighborhood, rescued him and sent him to\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1828, as Phebe Wright, surrounded by her little\r\nchildren, came out upon her back porch in the performance of some\r\nhousehold duty, she saw standing before her in the shade of the early\r\nNovember morning, a colored man without hat, shoes, or coat. He asked if\r\nMr. Wright lived there, and upon receiving an affirmative reply, said\r\nthat he wanted work. The good woman, comprehending the situation at a\r\nglance, told him to come into the house, get warm, and wait till her\r\nhusband came home. He was shivering with cold and fright. When William\r\nWright came home the fugitive told his story. He came from Hagerstown,\r\nMaryland, having been taught the blacksmith's trade there. In this\r\nbusiness it was his duty to keep an account of all the work done by him,\r\nwhich record he showed to his master at the end of the week. Knowing no\r\nwritten character but the figure 5 he kept this account by means of a\r\ncurious system of hieroglyphics in which straight marks meant horse\r\nshoes put on, circles, cart-wheels fixed, etc. One day in happening to\r\nsee his master's book he noticed that wherever five and one were added\r\nthe figure 6 was used. Having practiced this till he could make it he\r\never after used it in his accounts. As his master was looking over these\r\none day, he noticed the new figure and compelled the slave to tell how\r\nhe had learned it. He flew into a rage, and said, \"I'll teach you how to\r\nbe learning new figures,\" and picking up a horse-shoe threw it at him,\r\nbut fortunately for the audacious chattel, missed his aim.\r\nNotwithstanding his ardent desire for liberty, the slave considered it\r\nhis duty to remain in bondage until he was twenty-one years old in order\r\nto repay by his labor the trouble and expense which his master had had\r\nin rearing him. On the evening of his twenty-first anniversary he turned\r\nhis face toward the North star, and started for a land of freedom.\r\nArriving at Reisterstown, a village on the Westminster turnpike about\r\ntwenty-five miles from Baltimore and thirty-five miles from Mr. Wright's\r\nhouse, he was arrested and placed in the bar-room of the country tavern\r\nin care of the landlady to wait until his captors, having finished some\r\nwork in which they were engaged, could take him back to his master. The\r\nlandlady, being engaged in getting supper, set him to watch the cakes\r\nthat were baking. As she was passing back and forth he ostentatiously\r\nremoved his hat, coat, and shoes, and placed them in the bar-room.\r\nHaving done this, he said to her, \"I will step out a moment.\" This he\r\ndid, she sending a boy to watch him. When the boy came out he appeared\r\nto be very sick and called hastily for water. The boy ran in to get it.\r\nNow was his golden opportunity. Jumping the fence he ran to a clump of\r\ntrees which occupied low ground behind the house and concealing himself\r\nin it for a moment, ran and continued to run, he knew not whither, until\r\nhe found himself at the toll gate near Petersburg, in Adams county.\r\nBefore this he had kept in the fields and forests, but now found himself\r\ncompelled to come out upon the road. The toll-gate keeper, seeing at\r\nonce that he was a fugitive, said to him, \"I guess you don't know the\r\nroad.\" \"I guess I can find it myself,\" was the reply. \"Let me show you,\"\r\nsaid the man. \"You may if you please,\" replied the fugitive. Taking him\r\nout behind his dwelling, he pointed across the fields to a new brick\r\nfarm-house, and said, \"Go there and inquire for Mr. Wright.\" The slave\r\nthanked him and did as he was directed.\r\n\r\nHe remained with William Wright until April, 1829. During this short\r\ntime he learned to read, write, and cipher as far as the single rule of\r\nthree, as it was then called, or simple proportion. During his residence\r\nwith William Wright, nothing could exceed his kindness or gratitude to\r\nthe whole family. He learned to graft trees, and thus rendered great\r\nassistance to William Wright in his necessary business. When working in\r\nthe kitchen during the winter he would never allow Phebe Wright to\r\nperform any hard labor, always scrubbing the floor and lifting heavy\r\nburdens for her. Before he went away in the spring he assumed a name\r\nwhich his talents, perseverance, and genius have rendered famous in both\r\nhemispheres, that of James W.C. Pennington. The initial W. was for his\r\nbenefactor's family, and C. for the family of his former master. From\r\nWilliam Wright's he went to Daniel Gibbons', thence to Delaware county,\r\nPennsylvania, and from there to New Haven, Conn., where, while\r\nperforming the duties of janitor at Yale College, he completed the\r\nstudies of the college course. After a few years, he went to Heidelberg,\r\nwhere the degree of D.D. was conferred upon him. He never forgot William\r\nWright and his family, and on his return from Europe brought them each a\r\npresent. The story of his escape and wonderful abilities was spread over\r\nEngland. An American acquaintance of the Wright family was astonished,\r\non visiting an Anti-slavery fair in London many years ago, to see among\r\nthe pictures for sale there, one entitled, \"William and Phebe Wright\r\nreceiving James W.C. Pennington.\" The Dr. died in Florida, in 1870,\r\nwhere he had gone to preach and assist in opening schools amongst the\r\nFreemen.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 a party of sixteen slaves came to York, Pa., from Baltimore\r\ncounty, Md. Here they were taken in charge by William Wright, Joel\r\nFisher, Dr. Lewis, and William Yocum. The last named was a constable,\r\nand used to assist the Underground Rail Road managers by pretending to\r\nhunt fugitives with the kidnappers. Knowing where the fugitives were he\r\nwas enabled to hunt them in the opposite direction from that in which\r\nthey had gone, and thus give them time to escape. This constable and a\r\ncolored man of York took this party one by one out into Samuel Willis'\r\ncorn-field, near York, and hid them under the shocks. The following\r\nnight Dr. Lewis piloted them to near his house, at Lewisburg, York\r\ncounty, on the banks of the Conewago. Here they were concealed several\r\ndays, Dr. Lewis carrying provisions to them in his saddle-bags. When the\r\nsearch for them had been given up in William Wright's neighborhood, he\r\nwent down to Lewisburg and in company with Dr. Lewis took the whole\r\nsixteen across the Conewago, they fording the river and carrying the\r\nfugitives across on their horses. It was a gloomy night in November.\r\nEvery few moments clouds floated across the moon, alternately lighting\r\nup and shading the river, which, swelled by autumn rains, ran a flood.\r\nWilliam Wright and Dr. Lewis mounted men or women behind and took\r\nchildren in their arms. When the last one got over, the doctor, who\r\nprofessed to be an atheist, exclaimed, \"Great God! is this a Christian\r\nland, and are Christians thus forced to flee for their liberty?\" William\r\nWright guided this party to his house that night and concealed them in a\r\nneighboring forest until it was safe for them to proceed on their way to\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nJust in the beginning of harvest of the year 1851, four men came off\r\nfrom Washington county, Maryland. They were almost naked and seemed to\r\nhave come through great difficulties, their clothing being almost\r\nentirely torn off. As soon as they came, William Wright went to the\r\nstore and got four pair of shoes. It was soon heard that their masters\r\nand the officers had gone to Harrisburg to hunt them. Two of them,\r\nFenton and Tom, were concealed at William Wright's, and the other two,\r\nSam and one whose name has been forgotten, at Joel Wierman's. In a day\r\nor two, as William Wright, a number of carpenters, and other workmen,\r\namong whom were Fenton and Tom, were at work in the barn, a party of men\r\nrode up and recognized the colored men as slaves of one of their number.\r\nThe colored men said they had left their coats at the house. William\r\nWright looked earnestly at them and told them to go to the house and get\r\ntheir coats. They went off, and one of them was observed by one of the\r\nfamily to take his coat hastily down from where it hung in one of the\r\nouthouses, a few moments afterward. After conversing a few moments at\r\nthe barn, William Wright brought the slave-holders down to the house,\r\nwhere he, his wife and daughters engaged them in a controversy on the\r\nsubject of slavery which lasted about an hour. One of them seemed very\r\nmuch impressed, and labored hard to convince his host that he was a good\r\nmaster and would treat his men well. Finally one of the party asked\r\nWilliam Wright to produce the men. He replied that he would not do that,\r\nthat they might search his premises if they wished to, but they could\r\nnot compel him to bring forth the fugitives. Seeing that they had been\r\nduped, they became very angry and proceeded forthwith to search the\r\nhouse and all the outhouses immediately around it, without, however,\r\nfinding those whom they sought. As they left the house and went toward\r\nthe barn, William Wright, waving his hand toward the former, said, \"You\r\nsee they are not anywhere there.\" They then went to the barn and gave it\r\na thorough search. Between it and the house, a little away from the\r\npath, but in plain sight, stood the carriage-house, _which they passed\r\nby without seeming to notice_. After they had gone, poor Tom was found\r\nin this very house, curled up under the seats of the old-fashioned\r\nfamily carriage. He had never come to the house at all, but had heard\r\nthe voices of his hunters from his hiding-place, during their whole\r\nsearch. About two o'clock in the morning, Fenton was found by William\r\nWright out in the field. He had run along the bed of a small water\r\ncourse, dry at that time of year, until he came to a rye field amid\r\nwhose high grain he hid himself until he thought the danger was past.\r\nFrom William Wright's the slave-catchers went to Joel Wierman's, where,\r\ndespite all that could be done, they got poor Sam, took him off to\r\nMaryland and sold him to the traders to be taken far south.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 William Wright was a delegate from Adams county to the\r\nConvention at Philadelphia which nominated John C. Fremont for President\r\nof the United States. As the counties were called in alphabetical order,\r\nhe responded first among the Pennsylvania delegation. It is thought that\r\nhe helped away during his whole life, nearly one thousand slaves. During\r\nhis latter years, he was aided in the good work by his children, who\r\nnever hesitated to sacrifice their own pleasure in order to help away\r\nfugitives.\r\n\r\nHis convictions on the subject of slavery seem to have been born with\r\nhim, to have grown with his growth, and strengthened with his strength.\r\nHe could not remember when he first became interested in the subject.\r\n\r\nWilliam Wright closed his long and useful life on the 25th of October,\r\n1865. More fortunate than his co-laborer, Daniel Gibbons, he lived to\r\nsee the triumph of the cause in which he had labored all his life. His\r\nlatter years were cheered by the remembrance of his good deeds in the\r\ncause of human freedom. Modest and retiring, he would not desire, as he\r\ndoes not need, a eulogy. His labors speak for themselves, and are such\r\nas are recorded upon the Lamb's Book of Life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. BARTHOLOMEW FUSSELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Fussell, whose death occurred within the current year, was no\r\nordinary man. He was born in Chester county, Pa., in 1794, his ancestors\r\nbeing members of the Society of Friends, principally of English origin,\r\nwho arrived in America during the early settlement of Pennsylvania, some\r\nbeing of the number who, with William Penn, built their homes on the\r\nunbroken soil, where Philadelphia now stands.\r\n\r\nHe inherited all the bravery of these early pioneers, who left their\r\nhomes for the sake of religious freedom, the governing principle of his\r\nlife being a direct antagonism to every form of oppression. Removing in\r\nearly manhood, to Maryland, where negro Slavery was legally protected,\r\nhe became one of the most active opponents of the system, being a friend\r\nand co-laborer of Elisha Tyson, known and beloved as \"Father Tyson,\" by\r\nall the slaves of the region, and to the community at large, as one of\r\nthe most philanthropic of men.\r\n\r\nWhile teaching school during the week, as a means of self-education, and\r\nreading medicine at night, the young student expended his surplus energy\r\nin opening a Sabbath-school for colored persons, teaching them the\r\nrudiments of knowledge, not for a few hours only, but for the whole day,\r\nand frequently finding as many as ninety pupils collected to receive the\r\ninestimable boon which gave them the power of reading the Bible for\r\nthemselves. To the deeply religious nature of these Africans, this was\r\nthe one blessing they prized above all others in his power to bestow,\r\nand the overflowing gratitude they gave in return, was a memory he\r\ncherished to the latest years of his life.\r\n\r\nAfter his graduation in medicine, being at one time called upon to\r\ndeliver an address before the Medical Society of Baltimore, in the midst\r\nof a pro-slavery audience, and before slave-holding professors and men\r\nof authority, Dr. Fussell, with a courage scarcely to be comprehended at\r\nthis late day, denounced \"the most preposterous and cruel practice of\r\nSlavery, as replete with the causes of disease,\" and expressed the hope\r\nthat the day would come \"when Slavery and cruelty should have no abiding\r\nplace in the whole habitable earth; when the philosopher and the pious\r\nChristian could use the salutation of 'brother,' and the physician and\r\ndivine be as one man; when the rich and the poor should know no\r\ndistinction; the great and the small be equal in dominion, and the\r\n_arrogant master_ and _his menial slave_ should make a truce of\r\nfriendship with each other, all following the same law of reason, all\r\nguided by the same light of Truth!\"\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, a spirit so thoroughly awake to the welfare of\r\nhumanity, would hail with joy and welcome as a brother, the appearance\r\nof such a devoted advocate of freedom, as Benjamin Lundy; and, with all\r\nthe warmth of his nature, would give love, admiration, and reverence to\r\nthe later apostle of immediate emancipation, William Lloyd Garrison.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the pleasures of Dr. Fussell's life that he had been\r\nenabled to take the first number of the \"_Liberator_,\" and to continue a\r\nsubscriber without intermission, until the battle being ended, the last\r\nnumber was announced.\r\n\r\nHe was himself, one of the most earnest workers in the Anti-slavery\r\ncause, never omitting in a fearless manner, to embrace an opportunity to\r\nprotest against the encouragement of a pro-slavery spirit.\r\n\r\nReturning to Pennsylvania, to practice his profession, his home became\r\none of the havens where the hunted fugitive from Slavery found food,\r\nshelter and rest. Laboring in connection with the late Thomas Garrett,\r\nof Wilmington, Del., and with many others, at available points, about\r\ntwo thousand fugitives passed through his hands, on their way to\r\nfreedom, and amongst these, he frequently had the delight of welcoming\r\nsome of his old Sabbath-school pupils. The mutual recognition was\r\nsometimes touching in the extreme.\r\n\r\nIn later life, his anecdotes and reminiscences, told in the vivid style,\r\nresulting from a remarkably retentive memory, which could recall word,\r\ntone, and gesture, brought to life, some of the most interesting of his\r\nexperiences with these fleeing bondmen, whose histories no romance could\r\never equal.\r\n\r\nBeing one of the signers of the \"Declaration of Sentiments,\" issued by\r\nthe American Anti-slavery Society in 1833, he had also the gratification\r\nof attending the last meeting of the Pennsylvania Anti-slavery Society,\r\ncalled to celebrate the downfall of Slavery in America, and the\r\ndissolution of an organization whose purpose was effected. There are\r\nthose, who may remember how at that time, in perfect forgetfulness of\r\nself, the relation of the heroism of his friend, Elisha Tyson, seemed to\r\nrecall for a moment, the vigor of youth to render the decrepitude of age\r\nalmost majestic.\r\n\r\nBut it was not Slavery alone, which occupied the thoughts and attention\r\nof this large-hearted man. He was well known as an advocate of common\r\nschool education, of temperance, and of every other interest, which, in\r\nhis view, pertained to the welfare of man.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, he was addicted to the use of tobacco from his youth.\r\nHaving become convinced that it was an evil, he, for the sake of\r\nconsistency and as an example to others, resolutely abandoned the habit,\r\nat the age of seventy. He was fond of accrediting his resolve to a very\r\naged relative, who, in remonstrating with him upon the subject, replied\r\nto his remark, that a sudden cessation from a practice so long indulged\r\nin, might result in his death: \"Well, die, then, and go to heaven\r\ndecently.\"\r\n\r\nAs a practitioner of medicine, he was eminently successful, his intense\r\nsympathy with suffering, seeming to elevate his faculties and give them\r\nunwonted vigor in tracing the hidden causes of disease, and in\r\nsuggesting to his mind alleviating agencies. His patients felt an\r\nunspeakable comfort in his presence, well knowing that the best possible\r\nremedy which his knowledge, his judgment or his experience suggested,\r\nwould be selected, let the difficulty and inconvenience to himself be\r\nwhat it would. In cases where life hung trembling in the balance, he\r\nwould watch night after night, feeding the flickering flame until he\r\nperceived it brighten, and this in the abode of misery just as freely as\r\nin the home of wealth. The life-long affection of those whom he\r\nrecalled, was his reward where often none was sought or expected.\r\n\r\nHe believed in woman as only a thoroughly good man can, and from early\r\nyouth, he had been impressed with her peculiar fitness for the practice\r\nof medicine. The experience of a physician confirmed him in his\r\nsentiments, and it became one of his most earnest aspirations to open to\r\nher all the avenues to the study of medicine. In the year 1840, he gave\r\nregular instruction to a class of ladies, and it was through one of\r\nthese pupils, that the first female graduate in America was interested\r\nin the study of medicine. In 1846 he communicated to a few\r\nliberal-minded professional men, a plan for the establishment of a\r\ncollege of the highest grade for the medical education of women. This\r\nlong-cherished plan, hallowed to him by the approbation of a beloved\r\nwife, was well received. Others, with indomitable zeal, took up the\r\nwork, and finally, after a succession of disappointments and\r\ndiscouragements from causes within and without, the Woman's College, on\r\nNorth College avenue, Philadelphia, starting from the germ of his\r\nthought, entered on the career of prosperity it is so well entitled to\r\nreceive. Though never at any time connected with the college, he\r\nregarded its success with the most affectionate interest, considering\r\nits proposition as one of the most important results of his life.\r\n\r\nHappy in having lived to see Slavery abolished, and believing in the\r\nspeedy elevation of woman to her true dignity as joint sovereign with\r\nman, and in the mitigation of the evils of war, intemperance, poverty,\r\nand crime, which might be expected to follow such a result, he rested\r\nfrom his labors, and died in peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS SHIPLEY.[A]\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Shipley, one of the foremost in the early generation of\r\nphilanthropists who devoted their lives to the extinction of human\r\nslavery, was born in Philadelphia on the second of Fourth month, 1787.\r\nHe was the youngest of five children of William and Margaret Shipley,\r\nhis father having emigrated from Uttoxeter, in Staffordshire, England,\r\nabout the year 1750. From a very early period in the history of the\r\nSociety of Friends his ancestors had been members of that body, and he\r\ninherited from them the strong sense of personal independence, and the\r\nlove of toleration and respect for the rights of others which have ever\r\ncharacterized that body of people.\r\n\r\nSoon after his birth, his mother died, and he was thus early deprived of\r\nthe fostering care of a pious and devoted parent, whose counsels are so\r\nimportant in forming the youthful mind, and in giving a direction to\r\nfuture life.\r\n\r\nA few years after the death of his mother, his father was removed, and\r\nThomas was left an orphan before he had attained his sixth year. After\r\nthis affecting event he was taken into the family of Isaac Bartram, who\r\nhad married his eldest sister. Here he remained for several years,\r\nacquiring the common rudiments of education, and at a suitable age was\r\nsent to Westtown school; after remaining there for a little more than a\r\nyear, he met with an accident, which rendered it necessary for him to\r\nreturn home; and the effects of which prevented him from proceeding with\r\nhis education. He fell from the top of a high flight of steps to the\r\nground, and received an injury of the head, followed by convulsions,\r\nwhich continued at intervals for a considerable time, and rendered him\r\nincapable of any effort of mind or body.\r\n\r\nHe was, during childhood, remarkably fond of reading, and was\r\ndistinguished among his friends and associates for uncommon perseverance\r\nin accomplishing anything he undertook, a trait which peculiarly marked\r\nhim through life; his disposition is said to have been unusually amiable\r\nand docile, so as to endear him very strongly to his relatives and\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nAfter his removal from Westtown, he was again taken into the family of\r\nhis brother-in-law, and remained under the care of his sister, who was\r\nvery much attached to him, until he was placed as an apprentice to the\r\nhardware business. While here, he was entirely relieved of the\r\naffliction caused by the fall, and was restored to sound health. About\r\nthe age of twenty-one, he entered upon the pursuits of the business he\r\nhad selected.\r\n\r\nThe exact time at which his attention was turned to the subject of\r\nslavery cannot be ascertained, but it is probable that a testimony\r\nagainst it was among his earliest impressions as a member of the\r\nreligious Society of Friends. He joined the \"Pennsylvania Society for\r\nthe Promoting the Abolition of Slavery,\" etc., in 1817, and the ardent\r\ninterest which he took in its objects, was evinced on many occasions\r\nwithin the recollection of many now living. He was for many years an\r\nactive member of its Board of Education, and took a prominent part in\r\nextending the benefits of learning to colored children and youth.\r\n\r\nThe career of Thomas Shipley, as it was connected with the interests of\r\nthe colored community, abounds in incidents which have rarely occurred\r\nin the life of any individual. Being universally regarded as their\r\nadviser and protector, he was constantly solicited for his advice on\r\nquestions touching their welfare. This led him to investigate the laws\r\nrelating to this class of persons, in all their extended ramifications.\r\nThe knowledge he thus acquired, together with his practical acquaintance\r\nwith the business and decisions of our courts, rendered his opinion\r\npeculiarly serviceable on all matters affecting their rights. Never did\r\na merchant study more closely the varied relations of business, and\r\ntheir influence on his interests, than did Thomas Shipley all those\r\nquestions which concerned the well-being of those for whom he was so\r\nwarmly interested. He had volunteered his services as their advocate,\r\nand they could not have been more faithfully served had they poured out\r\nthe wealth of Croesus at the feet of the most learned counsel.\r\n\r\nOn every occasion of popular commotion where the safety of the colored\r\npeople was threatened, he was found at his post, fearlessly defending\r\ntheir rights, and exerting his influence with those in authority to\r\nthrow around them the protection of the laws. In the tumultuous scenes\r\nwhich disgraced Philadelphia, in the summer of 1835, in which the fury\r\nof the mob was directed against the persons and property of the colored\r\ninhabitants, he acted with an energy and prudence rarely found combined\r\nin the same individual.\r\n\r\nThe mob had collected and organized to the number of several hundred,\r\nand were marching through the lower part of the city, dealing\r\ndestruction in their course; the houses of respectable and worthy\r\ncolored citizens were broken in upon, the furniture scattered to the\r\nwinds, all they possessed destroyed or plundered, and they themselves\r\nsubjected to the most brutal and savage treatment. Defenceless infancy\r\nand decrepid age were alike disregarded in the general devastation which\r\nthese ruffians had decreed should attend their course. The color of the\r\nskin was the mark by which their vengeance was directed, and the cries\r\nand entreaties of their innocent and defenceless victims were alike\r\ndisregarded in the accomplishment of their ends. Already had several\r\nvictims fallen before the fury of the ruthless band. Law and order were\r\nlaid waste, and the officers of justice looked on, some perhaps with\r\ndismay, and others with indifference, while the rights of citizens were\r\nprostrated, and their peaceful and quiet homes invaded by the hand of\r\nviolence. At such a time the voice of remonstrance or entreaty, would\r\nhave been useless, and had the avowed friends of the colored man\r\ninterfered in any public manner, the effect would probably have been to\r\nincrease the fury of the storm, and to have directed the violence of the\r\nmob upon themselves.\r\n\r\nUnder these perilous circumstances, Thomas Shipley was determined to\r\nattempt an effort for their relief. He could not look on and see those\r\nfor whom he was so deeply interested threatened almost with\r\nextermination without an effort for their preservation, and yet he was\r\naware that his presence amongst the mob might subject him to\r\nassassination, without adding to the security of the objects of his\r\nsolicitude. He, therefore, determined to disguise himself in such a\r\nmanner as not to be recognized, and to mingle amongst the rioters in\r\norder to ascertain their objects, and if possible to convey such\r\ninformation to the proper authorities as might lead to the arrest of\r\nthose most active in fomenting disorder. Accordingly he left his house\r\nlate in the evening, attired so as to be completely disguised, and\r\nrepaired to the scene of tumult. By this time much mischief had been\r\ndone, and to add fresh fury to the multitude, and to incite them to new\r\ndeeds of blood, nothing was wanting but some act of resistance on the\r\npart of their victims, who, during the whole period, had conducted\r\nthemselves with a forbearance and patience highly creditable to them as\r\ngood citizens and upright Christians. Such an occasion was about to\r\noccur, and was prevented by the admirable coolness and forethought of\r\nThomas Shipley.\r\n\r\nA number of colored men who had been driven to desperation by the acts\r\nof the mob, and who had relinquished the idea of protection from the\r\ncivil authorities, determined to resort to arms, to defend themselves\r\nand their families from the further aggressions of their persecutors.\r\nThey accordingly repaired to Benezet Hall, one of their public buildings\r\nin South Seventh Street, with a supply of fire arms and ammunition,\r\ndetermined to fire upon the assailants, and maintain their post or die\r\nin the attempt. This fact became known to the leaders of the mob, and\r\nthe cry was raised to march for the hall, and make the attack. Thomas\r\nShipley who had mingled amongst the rioters, and apparently identified\r\nhimself with them, was now perfectly aware of all their designs; he knew\r\ntheir numbers, he had seen the implements of destruction which they were\r\nbrandishing about them, and he was aware that the occurrence of such a\r\nconflict would be attended with the most disastrous results, and might\r\nbe the beginning of hostilities which would terminate in the destruction\r\nof the weaker party, or at least in a dreadful effusion of human blood.\r\nSeeing the position in which the parties were now placed, he left the\r\nranks of the rioters, and ran at the top of his speed to the house in\r\nwhich the colored people were collected, awaiting the approach of their\r\nenemy. As he drew near, they were about coming out to meet their\r\nassailants, highly excited by continued outrages, and determined to\r\ndefend themselves or die. At this unexpected moment, their protector\r\ndrew nigh; he raised his voice aloud, and addressed the multitude. He\r\ndeprecated the idea of a resort to physical force, as being calculated\r\nto increase their difficulties, and to plunge them into general\r\ndistress, and entreated them to retire from the hall. His voice was\r\nimmediately recognized; the effect was electric; the whole throng knew\r\nhim as their friend; their fierce passions were calmed by the voice of\r\nreason and admonition. They could not disregard his counsels; he had\r\ncome among them, at the dead hour of night, in the midst of danger and\r\ntrial, to raise his warning voice against a course of measures they were\r\nabout to pursue. They listened to his remonstrances, and retreated\r\nbefore the mob had reached the building. At this juncture the Mayor and\r\nhis officers assembled in front of the hall, and by prompt and energetic\r\naction succeeded in dispersing the mob, and through the information\r\nreceived from Thomas Shipley, the ringleaders were secured and lodged in\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nThe part which Thomas Shipley acted in the trying scenes so often\r\npresented in our courts, during this unhappy period, has invested his\r\ncharacter with a remarkable degree of interest. It is probable that his\r\nconnection with the Pennsylvania Abolition Society was the means of\r\nenlisting his talents and exertions in this important service.\r\n\r\nThe energy and zeal of our friend in his efforts for the relief of those\r\nabout to be deprived of their dearest rights, soon distinguished him as\r\nthe most efficient member of the Society, in this department of its\r\nduties. So intense was his interest in all cases where the liberty of\r\nhis fellow-man was at issue, that, during a period of many years, he was\r\nscarcely ever absent from the side of the unhappy victim, as he sat\r\nbefore our judicial tribunals, trembling for his fate. The promptings of\r\ninterest, the pleasures and allurements of the world, the quiet\r\nenjoyment of a peaceful home, were all cheerfully sacrificed, when his\r\nservices were demanded in these distressing cases. Often has he left the\r\nbusiness, in which his pecuniary interests were materially involved, to\r\nstand by the unhappy fugitive in the hour of his extremity, with an\r\nalacrity and a spirit which could only be displayed by one animated by\r\nthe loftiest principles and the purest philanthropy.\r\n\r\nWho, that has ever witnessed one of these trying scenes, can forget his\r\nmanly and honest bearing, as he stood before the unrelenting and\r\narrogant claimant, watching with an eagle eye, every step of the process\r\nby which he hoped to gain his victim? Who has not been struck with his\r\nexpressive glances toward the judge, when a doubtful point arose in the\r\ninvestigation of the case? Who has not caught the lively expression of\r\ndelight which beamed from his countenance, when a fact was disclosed\r\nwhich had a favorable bearing on the liberty of the captive? Who has not\r\nadmired the sagacity with which his inquiries were dictated, and the\r\ntact and acumen with which he managed every part of his cause? His\r\nprinciple was unhesitatingly to submit to existing laws, however unjust\r\ntheir decrees might be, but to scan well the bearing of the facts and\r\nprinciples involved in each case, and to see that nothing was wanting in\r\nthe chain of evidence, or in the legal points in question, fully to\r\nsatisfy the requisitions of law. If a doubtful point arose, he was\r\nunwearied in investigating it, and devoted hours, days, and even weeks,\r\nin the collection of testimony which he thought would have a favorable\r\ninfluence on the prisoner.\r\n\r\nThrough his untiring vigilance, many victims have escaped from the hand\r\nof the oppressor, whose title to freedom, according to the laws of this\r\ncommonwealth, was undoubted, and many others, whose enslavement was at\r\nleast questionable.\r\n\r\nThe time and labor expended by Thomas Shipley in protecting the\r\ninterests of his colored clients, would be almost incredible to those\r\nwho were not aware of his extraordinary devotion to the cause. The only\r\nnotice which can be found among his papers, of the various slave cases\r\nin which he was engaged, is contained in a memorandum book, which he\r\ncommenced in the summer of 1835. In this book he has noted, in the order\r\nof their occurrence, such instances of difficulty or distress as\r\ndemanded his interference, almost without a comment. I find from this\r\nbook, that his advice and assistance were bestowed in twenty-five cases,\r\nfrom Seventh mo. 16th, to Eighth mo. 24th, 1836, a period of little more\r\nthan a month. A number of these cases required the writing of letters to\r\ndistant places; in some it was necessary for him to visit the parties\r\ninterested; and others demanded his personal attendance at court. This\r\nperhaps, may be considered as a fair average of the amount of labor\r\nwhich he constantly expended in this department of his benevolent\r\nefforts; and when we consider the time occupied in the necessary duties\r\nof his ordinary avocations, it must be evident that he possessed not\r\nonly extraordinary humanity, but uncommon activity and energy, to have\r\naccomplished so much.\r\n\r\nIn the memorandum book referred to, under date of Twelfth mo., 1835, I\r\nfind the following note: \"Spent eighteen days in the trial of A.\r\nHemsley, and his wife Nancy, and her three children, arrested at Mount\r\nHolly, the husband claimed by Goldsborough Price, executor of Isaac\r\nBoggs, of Queen Ann's county, Maryland, and the wife and children by\r\nRichard D. Cooper, of the same county. John Willoughby, agent for both\r\nclaimants. B.R. Brown and B. Clarke, attorneys for the claimant, and\r\nD.P. Brown, J.R. Slack, E.B. Cannon, and G.W. Camblos, for defendants.\r\nAfter a full argument, in which a manumission was produced for Nancy,\r\nfrom R.D. Cooper's father, she and her children were discharged, but her\r\nhusband was remanded; on which a certiorari was served on the judge, and\r\na habeas corpus placed in the sheriff's hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alexander was discharged by the Supreme Court, at Trenton, Third mo.\r\n5th. The circumstances of the case, were briefly the following: The\r\nwoman and children had been regularly manumitted in Delaware by the\r\nfather of the claimant, while the title of the father to freedom was\r\nless positive, though sufficiently clear to warrant a vigorous effort on\r\nhis behalf.\"\r\n\r\nThe first object of the counsel on the part of the alleged fugitive, was\r\nto prove the manumission of the mother and children, and, as it was\r\nthought, the necessary documents for that purpose were collected and\r\narranged. After the trial had proceeded, however, for a short time, the\r\nattorney for the defendants discovered a defect in the testimony on this\r\npoint; the necessary papers, duly authenticated by the Governor or Chief\r\nJustice of Delaware, were missing, and without them it was impossible to\r\nmake out the case. The fact was immediately communicated to Thomas\r\nShipley--he saw that the papers must be had, and that they could not be\r\nprocured without a visit to Dover, in Delaware. He at once determined to\r\nrepair thither in person, and obtain them. Without the knowledge of the\r\nclaimant's counsel, who might have taken advantage of the omission, and\r\nhurried the case to a decision; he started on the evening of the sixth\r\nday, and traveled as fast as possible to Dover, in the midst of a season\r\nunusually cold and inclement. On the next morning inquiries were made in\r\nall directions for friend Shipley; it was thought strange that he should\r\ndesert his post in the midst of so exciting and momentous a trial, and\r\nat a time when his presence seemed to be particularly required. The\r\ncounsel for the prisoners, who were aware of his movements, proceeded\r\nwith the examination of witnesses as slowly as possible, in order to\r\nallow time for procuring this important link in the chain of testimony,\r\nand thus to procrastinate the period when they should be called upon to\r\nsum up the case.\r\n\r\nFortunately, on the evening of the day on which Thomas Shipley set out\r\nupon his journey, it was proposed to adjourn, and farther proceedings\r\nwere postponed until Second day morning. At the meeting of the court, in\r\nthe morning, the expected messenger was not there, and the ingenuity of\r\nthe counsel was taxed still farther to procrastinate the important\r\nperiod. After three hours had been consumed in debate upon legal points,\r\nhe, who was so anxiously looked for, came hurrying through the crowd,\r\nmaking his way toward the bench. His countenance and his movements soon\r\nconvinced the wondering spectators that he was the bearer of gratifying\r\nnews, and in a few minutes, the mystery of his absence was revealed, by\r\nthe production of a document which was the fruit of his effort. The\r\npapers completely established the legal title of the mother and children\r\nto their freedom, and placed them out of the reach of further\r\npersecution. An attack of illness was the result of the extreme exertion\r\nand fatigue endured by this devoted man, in his earnest advocacy of the\r\nrights of these friendless beings.\r\n\r\nThe freedom of the husband and father, was, however, still in jeopardy.\r\nIf the decision of the court should be against him, he would be torn\r\nfrom the bosom of his now joyful and emancipated family, and consigned\r\nto a life of bondage. To avert this calamity, the counsel for the\r\nprisoner suggested an expedient as humane as it was ingenious. He\r\nproposed that a writ of certiorari which would oblige the judge to\r\nremove the case to the Supreme Court and a habeas corpus from the Chief\r\nJustice of the State, should both be in readiness when the decision of\r\nthe judge should be pronounced, in case that if it should be\r\nunfavorable, the writs might be at once served, and the prisoner\r\nremanded to the sheriff of the county, to be brought up before the\r\nSupreme Court at Trenton for another trial.\r\n\r\nTo procure these writs, it was necessary to obtain the signature of the\r\nchief justice of New Jersey, who resided at Newark, and again Thomas\r\nShipley was ready to enter with alacrity into the service. He saw the\r\nimportance of the measure, and that it would require prompt action,\r\ninasmuch as the decision of the judge would probably be pronounced on\r\nthe following day. It fortunately happened that a friend was just about\r\nleaving for Newark, in his own conveyance, and feeling an interest in\r\nthe case, he kindly invited friend Shipley to accompany him. They left\r\nin the afternoon, traveled all night, and arrived at Newark by daylight\r\nthe following morning. The weary traveler was unwilling, however, to\r\nretire to bed, although the night was exceedingly cold and tempestuous,\r\nbut he proceeded at once to the house of the chief justice. He called\r\nthe worthy judge from his bed, offering the importance of his business,\r\nand the necessity of speedy action, as an apology for so unseasonable a\r\nvisit. Chief Justice Hornblower, on being informed of the circumstances\r\nof the case, expressed his pleasure at having it in his power to accede\r\nto his wishes and treated him with a respect and kindness which the\r\ndisinterested benevolence of his mission was calculated to inspire.\r\n\r\nHaving obtained the necessary papers, he left at once for Mount Holly,\r\nwhere he arrived on the following day, in time to place the writs in the\r\nhands of the sheriff, just before the decision of Judge H. was\r\npronounced. Had he consulted his ease or convenience, and deferred his\r\nvisit to Newark a few hours, or had he, as most men, under similar\r\ncircumstances would have done, reposed his weary limbs, after a cold and\r\ndreary ride of eighty miles, in order to enable him to return with\r\nrenewed strength, he would have arrived too late to render this\r\nmeritorious effort effectual. As it was, he was there in time. The\r\njudge, according to the expectation of the friends of the colored man,\r\ngave his decision in favor of the slave-holders, and ordered poor\r\nAlexander to be given up to the tender mercies of the exasperated\r\nclaimant. The decision sent a thrill of indignation through the anxious\r\nand excited multitude, which perhaps, was never equalled amongst the\r\ninhabitants of that quiet town. The friends of humanity had assembled\r\nfrom all parts of the country to witness the proceedings in the case.\r\nMany of them were personally acquainted with the prisoner; they knew him\r\nto be a man of intelligence and integrity; he was an industrious and\r\norderly citizen, and was universally respected in the neighborhood. He\r\nwas now about to be made a slave, and was declared to be the property of\r\nanother. The father was about to be torn from his helpless children; the\r\nhusband in defiance of the Divine command, was to be wrested from the\r\nfond embrace of his sorrowing wife, to spend his days in misery and\r\ntoil. And this was to be done before the eyes of those who had a just\r\nregard for human rights, a hearty hatred of oppression. Is it wonderful,\r\nthat under such circumstances, there should have been a deep abhorrence\r\nfor the perpetrators of this outrage upon humanity, and a general\r\nsympathy for the innocent captive?\r\n\r\nBut it was decreed that those feelings of honest indignation should be\r\nspeedily supplanted by the warm outpouring of public gratitude and joy.\r\nWhile the feeling of the spectators was in this state of intense\r\ninterest and excitement, the judge, stern and inflexible in his\r\npurposes, and the clan of greedy claimants ready to seize upon their\r\nprey, the sheriff produced his writ of certiorari and handed it to the\r\ncourt. It was instantly returned, and the judge who sat unmoved, by a\r\nscene to which he was not unaccustomed, and conceiving, perhaps, that\r\nhis official dignity was impugned, persisted in his determination that\r\nthe prisoner should be handed over to the claimant. The prudence and\r\nforesight of Thomas Shipley and his friends had provided, however, for\r\nthis anticipated difficulty. Happily for the prisoner, he was yet\r\nembraced under the provision of that constitution, which secured to him\r\nthe protection of a habeas corpus, and this threw around him a shield\r\nwhich his enemies could not penetrate. A writ of habeas corpus, signed\r\nby the chief justice of the State and demanding the body of the\r\nprisoner, before the Supreme Court at its next term, was now produced!\r\n\r\nThe astonished judge found himself completely foiled. He had exercised\r\nhis authority to its utmost limit, in support of the claims of his\r\nslave-holding friends, and had given the influence of his station and\r\ncharacter, to bolster up the \"patriarchal institution;\" but it was all\r\nin vain. Just as they supposed they had achieved a victory, they were\r\nobliged with fallen crests, to succumb to the dictates of a higher\r\ntribunal, and to see their victim conveyed beyond their reach in the\r\nsafe keeping of the sheriff.\r\n\r\nIn the Third month, (March,) the case was brought up before the Supreme\r\nCourt for final adjudication. In the meantime, Thomas Shipley adopted\r\nvigorous measures to have the facts collected and arranged. He procured\r\nthe aid of an intelligent and humane friend of the cause, who resided\r\nnear Trenton, to attend, personally to the case, and secured the legal\r\nservices of Theodore Frelinghuysen, well known as one of the most gifted\r\nand virtuous statesmen of the age, and as a warm and zealous friend of\r\nthe oppressed. Under these happy auspices, the case came before the\r\nSupreme Court, and gave rise to a highly interesting and important\r\nargument; in which the distinguished Frelinghuysen appeared as the\r\ndisinterested advocate of the prisoner, and urged upon the court his\r\nclaim to liberty, under the laws of New Jersey, in a speech which was\r\none of his most brilliant and eloquent efforts, and added another to the\r\nmany laurels which his genius and philanthropy have achieved.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of Chief Justice Hornblower was given at length, and is said\r\nto have displayed a soundness and extent of legal knowledge, with a\r\nspirit of mildness and humanity, well worthy of the highest judicial\r\ntribunal of New Jersey.\r\n\r\nBy this decision, Alexander Helmsley was declared to be a freeman, and\r\nreturned with rejoicing into the bosom of his family, and to the\r\nenjoyment of the rights and privileges of a free citizen.\r\n\r\nThus terminated this interesting case, which for several months agitated\r\nthe public mind of Burlington county, to an extent almost unequalled.\r\n\r\nSuch disinterested devotion to the defence of the rights of the\r\noppressed, had it been displayed only in the instance recited, would be\r\nsufficient to enroll the name of Thomas Shipley on the list of the\r\nbenefactors of his race; but when we consider that, for a period of\r\ntwenty years, his history abounds in similar incidents, and that he\r\nuniformly stood forth as the unflinching advocate of the oppressed,\r\nregardless of the sacrifices which he was obliged to make on their\r\nbehalf, we are disposed to view him as one of that noble band whose\r\nlives have been consecrated to deeds of charity and benevolence, and\r\nwhose names will illumine the moral firmament, so long as virtue and\r\ntruth shall command the homage of mankind.\r\n\r\nThomas Shipley was one of the founders of the American Anti-Slavery\r\nSociety, and was an active agent in those stirring movements which soon\r\naroused the nation to a full consideration of the enormities of Slavery.\r\nHe was a prominent member of the Anti-slavery Convention, which\r\nassembled in this city in 1833, and a signer of their declaration of\r\nsentiments.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years of his life, he was more devotedly engaged in\r\nhis abolition labors than at any previous period. It was his constant\r\ndesire to diffuse the principles which had been so fearlessly proclaimed\r\nby the Convention, and to encourage the formation of Anti-slavery\r\nsocieties throughout the sphere of his influence. He was one of the most\r\nprominent members of the Philadelphia Anti-slavery Society, which was\r\nformed through much opposition, in 1835, and he steadily adhered to its\r\nmeetings, notwithstanding the threats which were so loudly made by the\r\nenemies of public order.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the popular commotions and tumults, which marked the\r\nprogress of Anti-slavery principles, he stood calm and unmoved. Having\r\nbeen long known as a firm friend of the rights of the colored man, and\r\nbeing amongst the most efficient public advocates of his cause, he was\r\nof course subjected to the revilings which were so liberally heaped upon\r\nthe Abolitionists at that time. His name was associated with that of\r\nTappan, Birney, Green, Jay, Garrison, and other leading Abolitionists,\r\nwho were singled out by slave-holders and their abettors as fit subjects\r\nfor the merciless attacks of excited mobs.\r\n\r\nIn several attempts which were made in this city to stir up the passions\r\nof the ignorant against the advocates of human rights, his person and\r\nproperty were openly threatened with assault. Such menaces failed,\r\nhowever, to deter him from the steady performance of what he believed to\r\nbe a solemn duty. Being fully satisfied of the truth of the principles\r\nwhich he had espoused, he relied with unwavering confidence upon Divine\r\npower for their ultimate triumph, and for the protection of those who\r\nadvocated them. When his friends expressed their anxiety for his safety,\r\nhe always allayed their apprehensions, and evinced by the firmness and\r\nbenignity of his manner that he was divested of the fear of man, and\r\nacted under the influence of that spirit which is from above.\r\n\r\nThe active part which Thomas Shipley took in Anti-slavery movements, did\r\nnot diminish his interest in the prosperity and usefulness of the old\r\nPennsylvania Society. He was a steady attendant on its meetings, and\r\nexercised his wonted care on all subjects connected with its interests.\r\n\r\nA short time previous to his death, his services were acknowledged by\r\nhis fellow-members, by his election to the office of president.\r\n\r\nThe incessant and fatiguing labors in which he was engaged, had sensibly\r\naffected the vigor of a constitution naturally delicate, and rendered\r\nhim peculiarly liable to the inroads of disease. He was seized in the\r\nautumn of 1836, with an attack of intermittent fever, which confined him\r\nto the house for ten or twelve days, and very much reduced his strength;\r\nwhile recovering from this attack, he experienced an accession of\r\ndisease which terminated his life in less than twenty-four hours. But a\r\nfew hours before his death, he inquired of his physicians as to the\r\nprobable issue of his case; when informed of his critical condition, he\r\nreceived the intelligence with composure, and immediately requested Dr.\r\nAtlee, who was by his side, to take down some directions in regard to\r\nhis affairs, on paper. In a few minutes after this, he quietly lapsed\r\ninto the sleep of death, in the morning, on the 17th of Ninth month,\r\n1836.\r\n\r\nHis last words were, \"I die at peace with all mankind, and hope that my\r\ntrespasses may be as freely forgiven, as I forgive those who have\r\ntrespassed against me.\"\r\n\r\nTo all who knew him well, of whatever class in the community, the\r\ntidings of this unexpected event brought a personal sorrow. It was felt\r\nthat a man of rare probity and virtue had gone to his reward. But to the\r\ncolored people the intelligence of his death was at once startling and\r\nconfounding. Their whole community was bowed down in public lamentation,\r\nfor their warmest and most steadfast friend was gone.\r\n\r\nThey repaired in large numbers to the house of their benefactor to\r\nobtain a last glance at his lifeless body. Parents brought their little\r\nones to the house of mourning, and as they gazed upon the features of\r\nthe departed, now inanimate in death, they taught their infant minds the\r\nimpressive lesson, that before them were the mortal remains of one who\r\nhad devoted his energies to the disenthralment of their race, and whose\r\nmemory they should ever cherish with gratitude and reverence. When the\r\nday arrived for committing his remains to the grave the evidence of deep\r\nand pervading sorrow among these wronged and outraged people was\r\nstrikingly apparent.\r\n\r\nThousands, whose serious deportment and dejected countenances evinced\r\nthat they were fully sensible of their loss, collected in the vicinity\r\nof his dwelling, anxious to testify their respect for his memory. Theirs\r\nwas not the gaze of the indifferent crowd, which clusters around the\r\nabodes of fashion and splendor, to witness the pomp and circumstance\r\nattendant on the interment of the haughty or the rich. It was a solemn\r\ngathering, brought together by the impulse of feeling, to mingle their\r\ntears and lamentations at the grave of one whom they had loved and\r\nrevered as a protector and a friend.\r\n\r\nWhen the hearse arrived at the quiet burial place in Arch street, where\r\nthe Friends for many generations have buried their dead, six colored men\r\ncarried the body to its last resting-place, and the silent tear of the\r\nson of Africa over the grave of his zealous friend, was more expressive\r\nof real affection than all the parade which is sometimes brought so\r\nostentatiously before the public eye. In the expressive words of the\r\nleading newspaper of the day, \"Aaron Burr was lately buried with the\r\nhonors of war. Thomas Shipley was buried with the honors of peace. Let\r\nthe reflecting mind pause in the honorable contrast.\"\r\n\r\nAs a public speaker Thomas Shipley was clear, cogent, sometimes\r\neloquent, and always impressive. He never attempted oratorical effect,\r\nor studied harangues. He generally spoke extemporaneously, on the spur\r\nof the occasion, and what he said came warm from the heart. It was the\r\nsimple and unadorned expression of his sentiments and feelings. He was,\r\nhowever, argumentative and even logical, when the occasion required it.\r\nWhen intensely interested, his eye was full of deep and piercing\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nAlthough his education had been limited, and his pursuits afforded him\r\nbut little leisure time, yet he indulged his fondness for reading, and\r\nexhibited a refined literary taste in his selections. He has left\r\namongst his books and papers eight manuscript volumes of about one\r\nhundred and fifty pages each, filled with selections, copied in his own\r\nhandwriting, and culled from the writings of many of the most gifted\r\nauthors, both in poetry and prose.\r\n\r\nThese extracts are generally of a moral and religious caste, and include\r\nscraps from Young, Milton, Addison, Burns, Cowper, Watts, Akenside,\r\nPope, Byron, Hemans, and many others.\r\n\r\nIn the domestic and social circle, his conversation was animated and\r\ninstructive, and always tempered by that kindness and amenity of manners\r\nwhich endeared him to his family and friends.\r\n\r\nHe was no bigot in religion. While a firm believer in the doctrines of\r\nthe Gospel as maintained by the orthodox Society of Friends, he yet held\r\nthat religion was an operative principle producing the fruits of\r\nrighteousness and peace, in all of whatever name, who are sincere\r\nfollowers of our Lord Jesus Christ. In conclusion we may add, that more\r\nthan most men he bore about with him the sentiment of that old Roman,\r\n\"Nihil humanum alienum a me puto,\" while he added to it the higher\r\nthought of the Christian, that he who loveth God loveth his brother\r\nalso. We need not dwell upon the life of such a man. To-day, after the\r\nlapse of more than a generation, his memory is fresh and green in the\r\nhearts of those who knew him, and who still survive to hand down to\r\ntheir children the story of the trials of that eventful period in our\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n_To the Memory of_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS SHIPLEY,\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society,\r\n\r\n\r\nWho died on the 17th of Ninth mo., 1836, a devoted Christian and\r\nPhilanthropist.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY JOHN G.

His father,\r\nWilliam Purvis, was a native of Ross county, in Northumberland, England.\r\nHis mother was a free-born woman, of Charleston. His maternal\r\ngrandmother was a Moor; and her father was an Israelite, named Baron\r\nJudah. Robert Purvis and his two brothers were brought to the North by\r\ntheir parents in 1819. In Pennsylvania and New England he received his\r\nscholastic education, finishing it at Amherst College. Since that time\r\nhis home has been in Philadelphia, or in the vicinity of that city.\r\n\r\nHis interest in the Anti-slavery cause began in his childhood, inspired\r\nby such books as \"Sandford and Merton,\" and Dr. Toney's \"Portraiture of\r\nSlavery,\" which his father put into his hands. His father, though\r\nresident in a slave state, was never a slaveholder; but was heartily an\r\nAbolitionist in principle. It was Robert Purvis' good fortune, before he\r\nattained his majority, to make the acquaintance of that earnest and\r\nself-sacrificing pioneer of freedom, Benjamin Lundy; and in conjunction\r\nwith him, was an early laborer in the anti-slavery field. He was a\r\nmember of the Convention held in Philadelphia in 1833, which formed the\r\nAmerican Anti-slavery Society; and among the signatures to its\r\nDeclaration of Sentiments, the name of Robert Purvis is to be seen; a\r\nrecord of which his posterity to the latest generation may be justly\r\nproud. During the whole period of that Society's existence he was a\r\nmember of it; and was also an active member and officer of The\r\nPennsylvania Anti-slavery Society. To the cause of the slave's freedom\r\nhe gave with all his heart his money, his time, his talents. Fervent in\r\nsoul, eloquent in speech, most gracious in manner, he was a favorite on\r\nthe platform of Anti-slavery meetings. High-toned in moral nature,\r\nkeenly sensitive in all matters pertaining to justice and integrity, he\r\nwas a most valuable coadjutor with the leaders of an unpopular reform;\r\nand throughout the Anti-slavery conflict, he always received, as he\r\nalways deserved, the highest confidence and warm personal regard of his\r\nfellow-laborers.\r\n\r\nHis faithful labors in aiding fugitive slaves cannot be recorded within\r\nthe limits of this sketch. Throughout that long period of peril to all\r\nwho dared to \"remember those in bonds as bound with them,\" his house was\r\na well-known station on the Underground Rail Road; his horses and\r\ncarriages, and his personal attendance, were ever at the service of the\r\ntravelers upon that road. In those perilous duties his family heartily\r\nsympathized with him, and cheerfully performed their share.\r\n\r\nHe has lived to witness the triumph of the great cause to which he\r\ndevoted his youth and his manhood; to join in the jubilee song of the\r\nAmerican slave; and the thanksgiving of the Abolitionists; and to\r\ntestify that the work of his life has been one \"whose reward is in\r\nitself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN HUNN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost within the lions' den, in daily sight of the enemy, in the little\r\nslave-holding State of Delaware, lived and labored the freedom-loving,\r\nearnest and whole-souled Quaker abolitionist, John Hunn. His\r\nheadquarters were at Cantwell's Bridge, but, as an engineer of the\r\nUnderground Rail Road, his duties, like those of his fellow-laborer\r\nThomas Garrett, were not confined to that section, but embraced other\r\nplaces, and were attended with great peril, constant care and expense.\r\nHe was well-known to the colored people far and near, and was especially\r\nsought with regard to business pertaining to the Underground Rail Road,\r\nas a friend who would never fail to assist as far as possible in every\r\ntime of need. Through his agency many found their way to freedom, both\r\nby land and water.\r\n\r\nThe slave-holders regarding him with much suspicion, watched him\r\nclosely, and were in the habit of \"breathing out threatenings and\r\nslaughter\" very fiercely at times. But Hunn was too plucky to be\r\nfrightened by their threats and menaces, and as one, commissioned by a\r\nhigher power to remember those in bonds as bound with them he remained\r\nfaithful to the slave. Men, women or children seeking to be unloosed\r\nfrom the fetters of Slavery, could not make their grievances known to\r\nJohn Hunn without calling forth his warmest sympathies. His house and\r\nheart were always open to all such. The slave-holders evidently\r\nconcluded that Hunn could not longer be tolerated, consequently devised\r\na plan to capture him, on the charge of aiding off a woman with her\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n[John Hunn and Thomas Garrett were conjointly prosecuted in this case,\r\nand in the sketch of the latter, the trial, conviction, etc., are so\r\nfully referred to, that it is unnecessary to do more than allude to it\r\nhere].\r\n\r\nThese noted Underground Rail Road offenders being duly brought before\r\nthe United States District Court, in May, 1848, Judge Taney, presiding,\r\nbacked by a thoroughly pro-slavery sentiment, obviously found it a very\r\neasy matter to convict them, and a still easier matter to fine them to\r\nthe extent of every dollar they possessed in the world. Thousands of\r\ndollars were swept from Hunn in an instant, and his family left utterly\r\ndestitute; but he was by no means conquered, as he deliberately gave the\r\ncourt to understand in a manly speech, delivered while standing to\r\nreceive his sentence. There and then he avowed his entire sympathy with\r\nthe slave, and declared that in the future, as in the past, by the help\r\nof God, he would never withhold a helping hand from the down-trodden in\r\nthe hour of distress. That this pledge was faithfully kept by Hunn,\r\nthere can be no question, as he continued steadfast at his post until\r\nthe last fetter was broken by the great proclamation of Abraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\nHe was not without friends, however, for even near by, dwelt a few\r\nwell-tried Abolitionists. Ezekiel Jenkins, Mifflin Warner, and one or\r\ntwo others, whole-souled workers in the same cause with Hunn; he was\r\ntherefore not forgotten in the hour of his extremity.\r\n\r\nWishing to produce a sketch worthy of this veteran, we addressed him on\r\nthe subject, but failed to obtain all the desired material. His reasons,\r\nhowever, for withholding the information which we desired were\r\nfurnished, and, in connection therewith, a few anecdotes touching\r\nUnderground Rail Road matters coming under his immediate notice, which\r\nwe here take great pleasure in transcribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BEAUFORT, S.C. 11th mo. 7th, 1871.\r\n\r\n    WM. STILL, DEAR FRIEND:--In thy first letter thee asked for my\r\n    photograph as well as for an opinion of the book about to be\r\n    edited by thyself. I returned a favorable answer and sent\r\n    likeness, as requested. I incidentally mentioned that, probably\r\n    some of my papers might be of service to thee. The papers\r\n    alluded to had no reference to myself; but consisted of\r\n    anecdotes and short histories of some of the fugitives from the\r\n    hell of American Slavery, who gave me a call, as engineer of the\r\n    Underground Rail Road in the State of Delaware, and received the\r\n    benefit of my advice and assistance.\r\n\r\n    I was twenty-seven years-old when I engaged in the Underground\r\n    Rail Road business, and I continued therein diligently until the\r\n    breaking up of that business by the Great Rebellion. I then came\r\n    to South Carolina to witness the uprising of a nation of slaves\r\n    into the dignity and privileges of mankind.\r\n\r\n    Nothing can possibly have the same interest to me. Therefore, I\r\n    propose to remain where this great problem is in the process of\r\n    solution; and to give my best efforts to its successful\r\n    accomplishment. In this matter the course that I have pursued\r\n    thus far through life has given me solid satisfaction. I ask no\r\n    other reward for any efforts made by me in the cause, than to\r\n    feel that I have been of use to my fellow-men.\r\n\r\n    No other course would have brought peace to my mind; then why\r\n    should any credit be awarded to me; or how can I count any\r\n    circumstance that may have occurred to me, in the light of a\r\n    sacrifice? If a man pursues the only course that will bring\r\n    peace to his own mind, is he deserving of any credit therefor?\r\n    Is not the reward worth striving for at any cost? Indeed it is,\r\n    as I well know.\r\n\r\n    Would it be well for me, entertaining such sentiments, to sit\r\n    down and write an account of my sacrifices? I think not.\r\n    Therefore please hold me excused. I am anxious to see thy book,\r\n    and will forward the price of one as soon as I can ascertain\r\n    what it is.\r\n\r\n    Please accept my thanks for thy kind remembrance of me. I am now\r\n    fifty-three years old, but I well remember thy face in the\r\n    Anti-slavery Office in Fifth street, when I called on business\r\n    of the Underground Rail Road. Our mutual friend, S.D. Burris,\r\n    was the cause of much uneasiness to us in those times. It\r\n    required much trouble, as well as expense to save him from the\r\n    slave-traders. I stood by him on the auction-block; and when I\r\n    stepped down, they thought they had him sure. Indeed he thought\r\n    so himself for a little while. But we outwitted them at last, to\r\n    their great chagrin. Those were stirring times, and the people\r\n    of Dover, Delaware, will long remember the time when S.D. Burris\r\n    was sold at public sale for aiding slaves to escape from their\r\n    masters, and was bought by the Pennsylvania Anti-slavery\r\n    Society. I remain very truly thy friend,\r\n\r\n    JOHN HUNN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CASE OF MOLLY, A SLAVE, BELONGING TO R---- B----, OF SMYRNA,\r\nDELAWARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY JOHN HUNN, ENGINEER OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nMolly escaped from her master's farm, in Cecil county, Maryland, and\r\nfound a place of refuge in the house of my cousin, John Alston, near\r\nMiddletown, Delaware. The man-hunters, headed by a constable with a\r\nsearch warrant, took her thence and lodged her in New Castle Jail. This\r\nfact was duly published in the county papers, and her master went after\r\nhis chattel, and having paid the expenses of her capture took immediate\r\npossession thereof.\r\n\r\nShe was hand-cuffed, and, her feet being tied together, she was placed\r\nin the wagon. Before she left the jail, the wife of the sheriff gave her\r\na piece of bread and butter, which her master kicked out of her hand,\r\nand swore that bread and butter was too good for her. After this act her\r\nmaster took a drink of brandy and drove off.\r\n\r\nHe stopped at a tavern about four miles from New Castle and took another\r\ndrink of brandy. He then proceeded to Odessa, then called Cantwell's\r\nBridge, and got his dinner and more brandy, for the day was a cold one.\r\nHe had his horse fed, but gave no food to his human chattel, who\r\nremained in the wagon cold and hungry. After sufficient rest for himself\r\nand horse he started again. He was now twelve miles from home, on a good\r\nroad, his horse was gentle, and he himself in a genial mood at the\r\nrecovery of his bond-woman. He yielded to the influence of the liquor he\r\nhad imbibed and fell into a sound sleep. Molly now determined to make\r\nanother effort for her freedom. She accordingly worked herself gradually\r\nover the tail board of the wagon, and fell heavily upon the frozen\r\nground. The horse and wagon passed on, and she rolled into the bushes,\r\nand waited for deliverance from her bonds. This came from a colored man\r\nwho was passing that way. As he was neither a priest nor a Levite, he\r\ntook the rope from her feet and guided her to a cabin near at hand,\r\nwhere she was kindly received. Her deliverer could not take the\r\nhand-cuffs off, but promised to bring a person, during the evening, who\r\ncould perform that operation. He fulfilled his promise, and brought her\r\nthat night to my house, which was in sight of the one whence she had\r\nbeen taken to New Castle Jail.\r\n\r\nI had no fear for her safety, as I believed that her master would not\r\nthink of looking for her so near to the place where she had been\r\narrested. Molly remained with us nearly a month; but, seeing fugitives\r\ncoming and going continually, she finally concluded to go further North.\r\nI wrote to my friend, Thomas Garrett, desiring him to get a good home\r\nfor Molly. This he succeeded in doing, and a friend from Chester county,\r\nPennsylvania, came to my house and took Molly with him. She remained in\r\nhis family more than six months.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the Fugitive Slave Law was passed by Congress, and\r\nseveral fugitives were arrested in Philadelphia and sent back to their\r\nmasters. Molly, hearing of these doings, became uneasy, and finally\r\ndetermined to go to Canada. She arrived safely in the Queen's Dominions,\r\nand felt at last that she had escaped from the hell of American Slavery.\r\n\r\nMolly described her master as an indulgent one when sober, but when he\r\nwas on a \"spree\" he seemed to take great delight in tormenting her. He\r\nwould have her beaten unmercifully without cause, and then have her\r\nstripes washed in salt water, then he would have her dragged through the\r\nhorse pond until she was nearly dead. This last operation seemed to\r\nafford him much pleasure. When he became sober he would express regret\r\nat having treated her so cruelly. I frequently saw this master of\r\nMolly's, and was always treated respectfully by him. He would have his\r\n\"sprees\" after Molly left him.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE ESCAPE FROM SLAVERY OF SAMUEL HAWKINS AND FAMILY, OF\r\nQUEEN ANNE'S COUNTY, MARYLAND, ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD, IN THE\r\nSTATE OF DELAWARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY JOHN HUNN.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 27th of 12th month (December), 1845, as I was\r\nwashing my hands at the yard pump of my residence, near Middletown, New\r\nCastle county, Delaware, I looked down the lane, and saw a covered wagon\r\nslowly approaching my house. The sun had just risen, and was shining\r\nbrightly (after a stormy night) on the snow which covered the ground to\r\nthe depth of six inches. My house was situated three quarters of a mile\r\nfrom the road leading from Middletown to Odessa, (then called Cantwell's\r\nBridge.) On a closer inspection I noticed several men walking beside the\r\nwagon. This seemed rather an early hour for visitors, and I could not\r\naccount for the circumstance. When they reached the yard fence I met\r\nthem, and a colored man handed me a letter addressed to Daniel Corbit,\r\nJohn Alston or John Hunn; I asked the man if he had presented the letter\r\nto either of the others to whom it was addressed; he said, no, that he\r\nhad not been able to see either of them. The letter was from my cousin,\r\nEzekiel Jenkins, of Camden, Delaware, and stated that the travelers were\r\nfugitive slaves, under the direction of Samuel D. Burris (who handed me\r\nthe note). The party consisted of a man and his wife, with their six\r\nchildren, and four fine-looking colored men, without counting the pilot,\r\nS.D. Burris, who was a free man, from Kent county, Delaware.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time that I ever saw Burris, and also the first time\r\nthat I had ever been called upon to assist fugitives from the hell of\r\nAmerican Slavery. The wanderers were gladly welcomed, and made as\r\ncomfortable as possible until breakfast was ready for them. One man, in\r\ntrying to pull his boots off, found they were frozen to his feet; he\r\nwent to the pump and filled them with water, thus he was able to get\r\nthem off in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nThis increase of thirteen in the family was a little embarrassing, but\r\nafter breakfast they all retired to the barn to sleep on the hay, except\r\nthe woman and four children, who remained in the house. They were all\r\nvery weary, as they had traveled from Camden (twenty-seven miles),\r\nthrough a snowstorm; the woman and four children in the wagon with the\r\ndriver, the others walking all the way. Most of them were badly\r\nfrost-bitten, before they arrived at my house. In Camden, they were\r\nsheltered in the houses of their colored friends. Although this was my\r\nfirst acquaintance with S.D. Burris, it was not my last, as he\r\nafterwards piloted them himself, or was instrumental in directing\r\nhundreds of fugitives to me for shelter.\r\n\r\nAbout two o'clock of the day on which these fugitives arrived at my\r\nhouse, a neighbor drove up with his daughter in a sleigh, apparently on\r\na friendly visit. I noticed his restlessness and frequent looking out of\r\nthe window fronting the road; but did not suppose, that he had come \"to\r\nspy out the land.\"\r\n\r\nThe wagon and the persons walking with it, had been observed from his\r\nhouse, and he had reported the fact in Middletown. Accordingly, in half\r\nan hour, another sleigh came up, containing a constable of Middletown,\r\nWilliam Hardcastle, of Queen Ann's county, Maryland, and William\r\nChesnut, of the same neighborhood. I met them at the gate, and the\r\nconstable handed me an advertisement, wherein one thousand dollars\r\nreward was offered for the recovery of three runaway slaves, therein\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nThe constable asked me if they were in my house? I said they were not!\r\nHe then asked me if he might search the house? I declined to allow him\r\nthis privilege, unless he had a warrant for that purpose. While we stood\r\nthus conversing, the husband of the woman with the six children, came\r\nout of a house near the barn, and ran into the woods. The constable and\r\nhis two companions immediately gave chase, with many halloos! After\r\nrunning more than a mile through the snow, the fugitive came toward the\r\nhouse; I went to meet him, and found him with his back against the\r\nbarn-yard fence, with a butcher's knife in his hand. The man hunters\r\nsoon came up, and the constable asked me to get the knife from the\r\nfugitive. This I declined, unless the constable should first give me his\r\npistol, with which he was threatening to shoot the man. He complied with\r\nmy request, and the fugitive handed me the knife. Then he produced a\r\npass, properly authenticated, and signed by a magistrate of Queen Ann's\r\ncounty, Maryland, certifying that this man was free! and that his name\r\nwas Samuel Hawkins.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hardcastle now advanced, and said that he knew the man to be\r\nfree; but that he was accused of running away with his wife and children\r\nwho were slaves. He also said, that this man had two boys with him, who\r\nbelonged to a neighbor of his, named Charles Wesley Glanding, and that\r\nthe four other children and mother belonged to Catharine Turner, of\r\nQueen Ann's county, Maryland. Hardcastle further expressed his belief,\r\nthat this man knew where his wife and children were at that time, and\r\ninsisted that he should go before a magistrate in Middletown, and be\r\nexamined in regard thereto. He also expressed doubts as to the\r\ngenuineness of this pass, and wished the man to go to Middletown on that\r\naccount also. As there was no other course to pursue under the\r\ncircumstances, I had my sleigh brought out, and we all went to\r\nMiddletown, before my friend, William Streets, who was then in\r\ncommission as a magistrate. It was now after dark of this short winter's\r\nday. Soon after our arrival at the office of William Streets, Hardcastle\r\nput his arm very lovingly around the neck of the colored man, Samuel\r\nHawkins, and drew him into another room. In a short time, Samuel came\r\nout, and told me that Hardcastle had agreed, that if he, Hawkins, would\r\ngive up his two older boys, who belonged to Charles Wesley Glanding;\r\nthen he might pursue his journey with his wife and four children. I\r\nasked him if he believed Hardcastle would keep his promise? He replied:\r\n\"Yes! I do not think master William would cheat me.\" I assured him that\r\nhe would cheat him, and that the offer was made for the purpose of not\r\nonly getting the two older boys (fourteen and sixteen years of age), but\r\nhis wife and other children to the office, when all of them would be\r\ntaken together to the jail, in New Castle. Samuel thought differently,\r\nand at his request, I wrote to my wife for the delivery of the family of\r\nSamuel Hawkins to the constable. They were soon forthcoming, and on\r\ntheir arrival at the office, a commitment was made out for the whole\r\nparty. Samuel and his two older sons were hand-cuffed, amidst many tears\r\nand lamentations, and they all went off under charge of the man-hunters,\r\nto New Castle jail, a distance of eighteen miles.\r\n\r\nWilliam Streets committed the whole party as fugitives from Slavery,\r\nwhile the husband (Samuel), was a free man. This was done on account of\r\nthe detestation of the wicked business, as much as on account of his\r\nfriendship for me.\r\n\r\nOn their arrival at the jail, about midnight, the sheriff was aroused,\r\nand the commitment shown to him; after reading it, he asked Samuel if he\r\nwas a slave? He said no, and showed his pass (which had been pronounced\r\ngenuine by the magistrate). The sheriff hereupon told them, that the\r\ncommitment was not legal, and would not hold them lawfully. It was now\r\nfirst day (Sunday), and the man-hunters were in a quandary.\r\n\r\nThe constable finally agreed to go back and get another commitment, if\r\nthe sheriff would take the party into the jail until his return;\r\nHardcastle also urged the sheriff to adopt this plan. Accordingly they\r\nwere taken into the jail.\r\n\r\nThe sheriff's daughter had heard her father's conversation with the\r\nconstable, accordingly she sent word on First-day morning, to my revered\r\nfriend, Thomas Garrett, of Wilmington, five miles distant, in regard to\r\nthe matter, inviting him to see the fugitives. Early on Second day\r\nmorning (Monday), Thomas went over with John Wales, attorney at law. The\r\nlatter soon obtained a writ of habeas corpus from Judge Booth of New\r\nCastle, which was served upon the sheriff; who, therefore, brought the\r\nwhole party before Judge Booth, who discharged them at once, as being\r\nillegally detained by the sheriff. Thomas Garrett, with the consent of\r\nthe judge, then hired a carriage to take the woman and four children\r\nover to Wilmington, Samuel and the two older boys walked, so they all\r\nescaped from the man-hunters. They went from Wilmington to Byberry, and\r\nsettled near the farm of Robert Purvis. Samuel Hawkins and wife have\r\nsince died, but their descendants still live in that neighborhood, under\r\nthe name of Hackett.\r\n\r\nSoon after the departure of the fugitives from New Castle jail, the\r\nconstable arrived with new commitments from William Streets, and\r\npresented them in due form to the sheriff; who informed him that they\r\nhad been liberated by order of Judge Booth! A few hours after, William\r\nHardcastle arrived from Philadelphia, expecting to take Samuel Hawkins\r\nand his family to Queen Ann's county, Maryland. Judge of his\r\ndisappointment at finding they were beyond his control--absolutely gone!\r\nThey returned to Middletown in great anger, and threatened to prosecute\r\nWilliam Streets for his participation in the affair.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of the Hawkins family from Middletown, I returned\r\nhome to see what had become of S.D. Burris and his four men. I found\r\nthem taking some solid refreshment, preparatory to taking a long walk in\r\nthe snow. They left about nine P.M., for Wilmington. I sent by S.D.\r\nBurris a letter to Thomas Garrett, detailing the arrest and commitment\r\nof S. Hawkins and family to New Castle jail. They all arrived safely in\r\nWilmington before daylight next morning. Burris waited to hear the\r\nresult of the expedition to New Castle; and actually had the pleasure of\r\nseeing S. Hawkins and family arrive in Wilmington.\r\n\r\nSamuel Burris returned to my house early on Third day morning, with a\r\nletter from Thomas Garrett, giving me a description of the whole\r\ntransaction. My joy on this occasion was great! and I returned thanks to\r\nGod for this wonderful escape of so many human beings from the\r\ncharnel-house of Slavery.\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICERS OF THE ROAD.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN HUNN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAMUEL RHOADS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM WHIPPER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAMUEL D. BURRIS]\r\n\r\nOf course this circumstance excited the ire of many pro-slavery editors\r\nin Maryland. I had copies of several papers sent me, wherein I was\r\ndescribed as a man unfit to live in a civilized community, and calling\r\nupon the inhabitants of Middletown to expel such a dangerous person from\r\nthat neighborhood! They also told exactly where I lived, which enabled\r\nmany a poor fugitive escaping from the house of bondage, to find a\r\nhearty welcome and a resting-place on the road to liberty. Thanks be to\r\nGod! for His goodness to me in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe trial which ensued from the above, came off before Chief Justice\r\nTaney, at New Castle. My revered friend, Thomas Garrett, and myself,\r\nwere there convicted of harboring fugitive slaves, and were fined\r\naccordingly, to the extent of the law; Judge Taney delivering the\r\nsentence. A detailed account of said trial, will fully appear in the\r\nmemoirs of our deceased friend, Thomas Garrett.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL RHOADS\r\n\r\n\r\nWas born in Philadelphia, in 1806, and was through life a consistent\r\nmember of the Society of Friends. His parents were persons of great\r\nrespectability and integrity. The son early showed an ardent desire for\r\nimprovement, and was distinguished among his young companions for warm\r\naffections, amiable disposition, and genial manners, rare purity and\r\nrefinement of feeling, and a taste for literary pursuits. Preferring as\r\nhis associates those to whom he looked for instruction and example, and\r\naiming at a high standard, he won a position, both mentally and\r\nsocially, superior to his early surroundings. With a keen sense of\r\njustice and humanity, he could not fail to share in the traditional\r\nopposition of his religious society to slavery, and to be quickened to\r\nmore intense feeling as the evils of the system were more fully revealed\r\nin the Anti-slavery agitation which in his early manhood began to stir\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\nA visit to England, in 1834, brought him into connection and friendship\r\nwith many leading Friends in that country, who were actively engaged in\r\nthe Anti-slavery movement, and probably had much to do with directing\r\nhis attention specially to the subject. Once enlisted, he never wavered,\r\nbut as long as slavery existed by law in our country his influence, both\r\npublicly and privately, was exerted against it. He was strengthened in\r\nhis course by a warm friendship and frequent intercourse with the late\r\nAbraham L. Pennock, a man whose unbending integrity and firm allegiance\r\nto duty were equalled only by his active benevolence, broad charity, and\r\nrare clearness of judgment. Samuel Rhoads, like him, while sympathizing\r\nwith other phases of the Anti-slavery movement, took especial interest\r\nin the subject of abstaining from the use of articles produced by slave\r\nlabor. Believing that the purchase of such articles, by furnishing to\r\nthe master the only possibility of pecuniary profit from the labor of\r\nhis slaves, supplied one motive for holding them in bondage, and that\r\nthe purchaser thus became, however unwittingly, a partaker in the guilt,\r\nhe felt conscientiously bound to withhold his individual support as far\r\nas practicable, and to recommend the same course to others.\r\n\r\nHis practical action upon these views began about the year 1841, and was\r\npersevered in, at no small expense and inconvenience, till slavery\r\nceased in this country to have a legal existence. About this time he\r\nunited with the American Free Produce Association, which had been formed\r\nin 1838, and in 1845 took an active part in the formation of the Free\r\nProduce Association of Friends of Philadelphia, Y.M.; both associations\r\nhaving the object of promoting the production by free labor of articles\r\nusually grown by slaves, particularly of cotton. Agents were sent into\r\nthe cotton States, to make arrangements with small planters, who were\r\ngrowing cotton by the labor of themselves and their families without the\r\nhelp of slaves, to obtain their crops, which otherwise went into the\r\ngeneral market, and could not be distinguished. A manufactory was\r\nestablished for working this cotton, and a limited variety of goods were\r\nthus furnished. In all these operations Samuel Rhoads aided efficiently\r\nby counsel and money.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, \"The Non-slave-holder,\" a monthly periodical, devoted mainly to\r\nthe advocacy of the Free Produce cause, was established in Philadelphia,\r\nedited by A.L. Pennock, S. Rhoads, and George W. Taylor. It was\r\ncontinued five years, for the last two of which Samuel Rhoads conducted\r\nit alone. He wrote also a pamphlet on the free labor question. From\r\nJuly, 1856 to January, 1867 he was Editor of the \"Friends' Review,\" a\r\nweekly paper, religious and literary, conducted in the interest of his\r\nown religious society, and in this position he gave frequent proofs of\r\ninterest in the slave, keeping his readers well advised of events and\r\nmovements bearing upon the subject.\r\n\r\nWhile thus awake to all forms of anti-slavery effort, his heart and hand\r\nwere ever open to the fugitive from bondage, who appealed to him, and\r\nnone such were ever sent away empty. Though not a member of the\r\nVigilance Committee, he rendered it frequent and most efficient aid,\r\nespecially during the dark ten years after the passage of the Fugitive\r\nSlave Law.\r\n\r\nA second visit to England, in 1847, had enlarged his connection and\r\ncorrespondence with anti-slavery friends there, and in addition to his\r\nown contributions, very considerable sums of money were transmitted to\r\nhim, especially through A.H. Richardson, for the benefit of the\r\nfugitives. Often when the treasury of the Committee ran low, he came\r\nopportunely to their relief with funds sent by his English friends,\r\nwhile his sympathy and encouragement never failed. The extent of his\r\nassistance in this direction was known to but few, but by them its value\r\nwas gratefully acknowledged. None rejoiced more than he in the overthrow\r\nof American slavery, though its end came in convulsion and bloodshed, at\r\nwhich his spirit revolted, not by the peaceful means through which he\r\nwith others had labored to bring it about. He had some years before been\r\nactive in preparing a memorial to Congress, asking that body to make an\r\neffort to put an end to slavery in the States, by offering from the\r\nnational treasury, to any State or States which would emancipate the\r\nslaves therein, and engage not to renew the system, compensation for\r\nlosses thus sustained. This proposition was made, not as admitting any\r\n_right_ of the masters to compensation; but on the ground that the whole\r\nnation, having shared in the guilt of maintaining slavery, might justly\r\nshare also in whatever pecuniary loss might follow its abandonment.\r\n\r\nThis memorial was sent to Congress, but elicited no response; and in the\r\nfulness of time, the nation paid even in money many times any possible\r\nprice that could have been demanded under this plan. Samuel Rhoads died\r\nin 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE CORSON\r\n\r\n\r\nWas born in Plymouth township, Montgomery county, Pennsylvania, January\r\n24th, 1803. He was the son of Joseph and Hannah Corson. He was married\r\nJanuary 24th, 1832, to Martha, daughter of Samuel and Susanna Maulsby.\r\n\r\nThere were perhaps few more devoted men than George Corson to the\r\ninterests of the oppressed everywhere. The slave, fleeting from his\r\nmaster, ever found a home with him, and felt while there that no\r\nslave-hunter would get him away until every means of protection should\r\nfail. He was ever ready to send his horse and carriage to convey them on\r\nthe road to Canada, or elsewhere towards freedom. His home was always\r\nopen to entertain the anti-slavery advocates, and being warmly supported\r\nin the cause by his excellent wife, everything which they could do to\r\nmake their guests comfortable was done. The Burleighs, J. Miller McKim,\r\nMiss Mary Grew, F. Douglass, and others will not soon forget that\r\nhospitable home. It is to be regretted that he died before the\r\nemancipation of the slaves, which he had so long labored for, arrived.\r\nIn this connection it may not be improper to state that simultaneously\r\nwith his labors in the Anti-slavery cause, he was also laboring with\r\nzeal in the cause of Temperance. Of his efforts in that direction\r\nthrough nearly thirty years, our space will not allow us to speak. His\r\nlife and labors were a daily protest against the traffic of rum. There\r\nis also another phase of his character which should be mentioned.\r\nWhenever he saw animals abused, horses beaten, he instantly interfered,\r\noften at great risk of personal harm from the brutal drivers about the\r\nlime quarries and iron ore diggings. So firm, so determined was he, that\r\nthe cruellest ruffian felt that he must yield or confront the law. Take\r\nhim all for all, there will rarely be found in one man more universal\r\nbenevolence and justice than was possessed by the subject of this\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nHiram Corson, brother of the subject of this sketch, and a faithful\r\nco-laborer in the cause, in response to a request that he would furnish\r\na reminiscence touching his brother's agency in assisting fugitives,\r\nwrote as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    _November 1st_, 1871.\r\n\r\n    DEAR ROBERT:--Wm. Still wishes some account of the case of the\r\n    negro slave taken from our neighborhood some years ago, after an\r\n    attempt by my brother George to release him. (About thirty years\r\n    ago.) George had been on a visit to our brother Charles, living\r\n    at the fork of the Skippack and Perkiomen Creeks, in this\r\n    county, and on his return, late in the afternoon, while coming\r\n    along an obscure road, not the main direct road, he came up to a\r\n    man on horseback, who was followed at a distance of a few feet\r\n    by a colored man with a rope tied around his neck, and the other\r\n    end held by the person on horseback.\r\n\r\n    George had had experience with those slave-drivers before, as in\r\n    the case of John and James Lewis, and withal had become deeply\r\n    interested in the Anti-slavery cause. He, therefore, inquired of\r\n    the mounted man, what the other had done that he was to be thus\r\n    treated. He quietly remarked that he was his slave and had run\r\n    away. He then asked by what authority he held him. He said by\r\n    warrant from Esquire Vanderslice. Indignant at this great\r\n    outrage, my brother hurried on to Norristown, and waited his\r\n    arrival with a process to arrest him. The slave-master,\r\n    confident in his rights, bold in the country of those pretended\r\n    freemen, who were ever ready to kiss the rod of Slavery, came\r\n    slowly riding into Norristown, just before sunset, with the rope\r\n    still fast to the slave's neck. He was immediately taken before\r\n    a Justice of the Peace, whose name I do not now remember. The\r\n    people gathered around; anxious inquiries were made as to the\r\n    person who had the audacity to question the right of this quiet,\r\n    peaceable man to do with his slave as he pleased. Great scorn\r\n    was expressed for the busy Abolitionists. Much sympathy given to\r\n    the abused slave owner. It was soon decided, by the aid of a\r\n    volunteer lawyer, whose sons have since fought the battle for\r\n    freedom, that the slave-owner had a right to take his slave\r\n    whereever, and in whatever way he pleased, through the country,\r\n    and not only that, but at his call for help it was the bounden\r\n    duty of every man, called upon, to aid him; and the person who\r\n    had the audacity to stop him was threatened with punishment.\r\n\r\n    But George's blood was up, so pained was he at the sight of a\r\n    man, a poor man, a helpless man, being dragged through from\r\n    Pennsylvania with a halter around his neck, that, amidst the\r\n    jeers and insults of the debased crowd, he denounced Slavery,\r\n    its aiders and abettors, in tones of scorn and loathing. But the\r\n    man thief was left with his prey. Through the advice of those\r\n    who stood by the slave laws and who knelt before the slave\r\n    power, as personified by that hunter of slaves, the rope was\r\n    taken from the neck, and the man guarded while the master\r\n    regaled himself. That night he disappeared with his man.\r\n\r\n    I can also give a few particulars of the escape of the Gorsuch\r\n    murderers, from Norristown on their way to Canada. There should\r\n    be a portrait of Daniel Ross, and a history of his labors during\r\n    twenty or more years. Hundreds were entertained in his humble\r\n    home, and it was in his home that the Gorsuch murderer was\r\n    secreted. He must not be left out. I can also get the whole\r\n    history, escape, capture, trial, conviction and redemption of\r\n    James and John Lewis, and one other. They were captured here\r\n    within sight of our house. George Corson, Esq., published it\r\n    all, about ten years ago. Respectfully,\r\n\r\n    ROBERT R. CORSON.\r\n\r\n    HIRAM CORSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES D. CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Still has asked me to record the part that my father bore in the\r\nAnti-slavery enterprise, as it began and grew in this city. I comply,\r\nbecause the history of that struggle would be very incomplete, if from\r\nit were omitted the peculiar work which my father's position here shaped\r\nfor him. Yet I can only indicate his work, not portray it; tell some of\r\nits elements, and then leave them to the moral sympathies of the reader\r\nto upbuild. For, first, his labor for the love of man was evenly\r\ndistributed through the mould and movements of his entire life; and from\r\na perpetual current of nourishing blood, one cannot name those\r\nparticular atoms that are busiest or richest to sustain vitality. And,\r\nfurther, if I could hear his voice, it would forbid any detailed account\r\nof what he accomplished and endured. It was all done unobtrusively in\r\nhis life; bravely, defiantly, in regard of the evil to be met and\r\nmastered, but as unconsciously in regard of himself as every conviction\r\nworks, when it is as broad as the entire spiritual life of a man and has\r\nhis entire spiritual force to give it expression. I know, therefore,\r\nthat while I should be permitted to mention so much of his service as\r\nthe history of the conflict might demand, I should be forbidden all tale\r\nof sacrifice and labor that mere personal narrative would include; and I\r\nask now only this: What peculiar influence did he exert for the\r\nfurtherance of the cause which so largely absorbed his labor and life?\r\nDid he contribute anything to it stamped with the signature of so clear\r\nan individuality that no other man could have contributed quite the\r\nsame? To this I maintain an affirmative answer; and in witness of its\r\ntruth, I sketch the general course of his life, that through it we may\r\nfind those elements of his character which intuitively ranged him on the\r\nside of the slave.\r\n\r\nWhen my father came to Philadelphia in 1834, his sentiments in regard to\r\nSlavery were those held generally in the North--an easy-going wish to\r\navoid direct issue with the South on a question supposed to be\r\npeculiarly theirs. But the winds of Heaven owned to no decorous limit in\r\nMason and Dixon's line; and there were larger winds blowing than\r\nthese--winds rising in the vast laboratories of the general human heart,\r\nand destined to sweep into all the vast spaces of human want and woe.\r\nThe South was finding, through her blacks' perpetual defiance of torture\r\nand death for freedom, that there was perhaps something, even in a\r\nnegro, which most vexatiously refused to be counted in with the figures\r\nof the auctioneer's bill of sale; and now the North's lesson was coming\r\nto her--that the soul of a century's civilization was still less\r\npurchasable than the soul of a slave. A growing feeling of humanity was\r\nstirring through the northern States. It was not the work, I think, of\r\nany man or body of men; it was rather itself a creative force, and made\r\nmen and bodies of men the results of its awakening influence. To such a\r\npower, my father's nature was quickly responsive. Both his head and his\r\nheart recognized the terrible wrongs of the enslaved, and the urgency\r\nwith which they pressed for remedy; but where was the means? From the\r\nfirst, he felt that the movement which brought Freedom and Slavery\r\nfairly into the field and squarely against each other, threw unnecessary\r\nobstacles in its own way by the violence with which it was begun and\r\nprosecuted. If he were to work at all in the cause, he determined to\r\nwork within the limits of recognized law. The Colonization Society held\r\nout a good hope; at least, he could see no other as close to the true\r\nbut closer to the feasible; and, after connecting himself with it, he\r\nseems to have been content for a while on the score of political\r\nmatters, and to have devoted himself to what he had adopted as his chief\r\npurpose in life. This was, enlarging the sphere of female education, and\r\ngiving it a more vigorous tone. To this he tasked all his abilities. His\r\nconvictions on the subject were very earnest; his strength of character\r\nsufficient to bear them out; so that, in a short time, he was able to\r\nestablish his school so firmly in the respect of this community, that,\r\nfor twenty-five years, all the odium that his activity in the\r\nAnti-slavery cause drew upon him did not for a moment abate the public\r\nconfidence accorded to his professional power.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1836, in one of his vacations, that his mind was violently\r\nturned inwards to re-examine his status upon the Anti-slavery question.\r\nHe happened to be visiting his old college-friend, Salmon P. Chase, at\r\nCincinnati, and, fortunately for the spiritual life of both men, it was\r\nat the time of the terrible riots that broke up the press of John G.\r\nBirney. Both being known as already favoring the cause of the slave,\r\nthey stood in much peril for several days; but when the dark time was\r\npassed, the clearness that defined their sentiments was seen to be worth\r\nall the personal danger that had bought it. Self-delusion on the subject\r\nwas no longer possible. The deductions from the facts were as plain as\r\nthe facts themselves. The two friends took counsel together, and adopted\r\nthe policy from which thenceforward neither ever swerved. A great cloud\r\nwas rolled from their eyes. In all this turmoil of riot, they saw on the\r\none side, indeed, a love of man great in its devotion; but on the other,\r\na moral deadness in the North so profound and determined that it\r\nthreatened thus brutally any voice that would disturb it. Their duty,\r\nthen, was evident: to fling all the forces of their lives, and by all\r\nsocial and political means, right against this inertness, and shatter it\r\nif they could. To Mr. Chase, the course of things gave the larger\r\npolitical work; to my father, the larger social. His diary records how\r\namazed he was, when he returned to Philadelphia, at his former\r\nblindness, and how thankful to the spirit of love that had touched and\r\ncleansed his eyes that he might see God's image erect. He knew now that\r\nhis lot had been cast in the very stronghold of apathy, the home of a\r\nlukewarm spirit, which, not containing anything positive to keep it\r\nclose to the right, let its sullen negativeness gravitate towards the\r\nwrong. It will be difficult to make coming generations understand, not\r\nthe flaming antagonism to humanity, but the more brutal avoidance of it\r\nthat ruled the political tone in this latitude, from 1836 to 1861. I\r\nhave thought of the word _bitterness_, as expressing it; but though that\r\nmight convey somewhat of its recoil when disturbed, it pictures nothing\r\nof its inhuman solicitude against all disturbance. Conservatism, it was\r\ncalled; and certainly it did conserve the devil admirably. At the South,\r\none race of men were so basely wielding a greater physical power over\r\nanother race of men, as to crush from them the attributes of\r\nself-responsible creatures; Philadelphia, the city of the North nearest\r\nthe wrong, made no plea for humanity's claims. It went on, this\r\nmonstrous abrogation of everything that lends sanctity to man's\r\nrelations on earth, till slaves were beasts, with instincts annihilated,\r\nand masters demons, with instincts reversed; Philadelphia made no plea\r\nfor the violated rhythm of life on either side. Even the Church betrayed\r\nits mission, and practically aided in stamping out from millions the\r\nspirit that related them to the Divine; still Philadelphia made no plea\r\nfor God's love in his humanity. Utterly insensible to the most piercing\r\nappeals that man can make to man, she loved her hardness, clung to it;\r\nand if, now and then, a voice from the North blew down, warningly as a\r\ntrumpet, the great city turned sluggishly in her bed of spiritual and\r\npolitical torpor, and cried: Let be, let be! a little more slumber! a\r\nlittle more folding of the hands to my moral death-sleep!\r\n\r\nThis souring of faith, this half-paralysis of the heart's beating, this\r\nblurring of the intuitions that make manhood possible, were what my\r\nfather found here in that year of our Lord's grace, 1836. It will be\r\nworth while to watch him move into the fight and bear his part in its\r\nthickest, just to learn how largely history lays her humanitarian\r\nadvances on a few willing souls.\r\n\r\nThe means which lay readiest to his use for rousing the dormant spirit\r\nof the city was his social position. And yet how hard, one would think,\r\nit must have been to make this sacrifice. He came accredited by all the\r\nclaims of finished culture, a man consecrated to the scholar's life.[A]\r\nThen, with the sensitiveness that springs from intellectual breeding,\r\none will look to see him shrink from conflict with the callous condition\r\nof feeling around him. The glamour of book-lore will spread over it, and\r\nhide it from his sight. He has a noble enough mission, at all events: to\r\nraise the standard of educational culture in a city that hardly knows\r\nthe meaning of the term; and if any glimpse should come to him of the\r\nlethargic inhumanity around him, he can afford to let it pass as a\r\nglimpse--his look being fixed on the sacred heights which the scholar's\r\nfeet must tread.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: All that I here write of my father, I write equally of his\r\nco-laborer in the same sphere of work--Rev. W.H. Furness; and if it is\r\ntrue of others whom I did not know, then to their memory also I bear\r\nthis record of the two whose labors and characters it has been the\r\ndeepest privilege of my life to know so well.]\r\n\r\nAh, how his course, so different, proves to us that the true scholar is\r\nalways a scholar of truth. No matter what element of the public\r\nsentiment he met--the listlessness of pampered wealth; the brutal\r\nprejudice of some voting savage; the refined sneer of lettered\r\ndilettanteism; the purposed aversion of trade or pulpit fearing\r\ndisturbed markets or pews;--he beat lustily and incessantly at all the\r\nparts of the iron image of wrong sitting stolidly here with close-shut\r\neyes. No matter when it was, on holiday or working-day or Sabbath; at\r\nhome and abroad; in the parlor, the street, the counting-room; in his\r\nschool and in the Church;--he bore down on this apathy and its brood of\r\nscorns like a west wind that sweeps through a city dying under weight of\r\nmiasma. And the wind might as well cease blowing yet not cease to be\r\nwind, as my father's influence stop and himself live. It scattered the\r\ngood seed everywhere. How often have I heard him say, \"I know nothing of\r\nwhat the harvest will be; I am responsible only for the sowing.\" And\r\nbravely went the sowing on, with the broadcast largesse of love. There\r\nwas no breeze of talk that did not carry the seeds;--to the wayside, for\r\nfrom those that even chance upon the truth the fowls of the air cannot\r\ntake it all; to thin soil and among thorns, for no heart so feeble or\r\nchoked that will not find in a single day's growth of truth germination\r\nfor eternity; to stony places, for no cranny in the rocks that can hold\r\na seed but can be a home for riving roots;--\"And other fell on good\r\nground and did bring forth fruit.\"\r\n\r\nThus it was primarily to rouse those of his own class that he labored,\r\nto gall them into seeing (though they should turn again and rend him)\r\nthat moral supineness is moral decay, that the soul shrivels into\r\nnothingness when wrong is acquiesced in, as surely as it is torn and\r\nscattered by the furies let loose within it, when wrong is done. But\r\njust there lay the difficulty and pain of his mission: that, from his\r\nacknowledged standing in the literary world, and as a leader in the\r\ninterests of higher education, his path brought him into contact mainly\r\nwith the cultured, and it was among these that the pro-slavery spirit\r\nruled with its bitterest stringency. Not cultured: let us unsay the\r\nword; rather, with the gloss and hard polish which reading and wealth\r\nand the finer appointments of living can throw over spiritual arrest or\r\ndecay. Culture is a holy word, and dare be used of intellectual advance\r\nonly when the moral sympathies have kept equal step. It includes\r\nsomething beyond an amateur sentiment; in favor of what we favor. If it\r\ndoes not open the ear to every cry of humanity, struggling up or\r\nslipping back, it is no culture properly so called, but a sham, a mask\r\nof wax, a varnish with cruel glitter; and what a double wrath will be\r\npoured on him who cracks the wax and the varnish, not only because of\r\nthe rude awakening, but because the crack shows the sham.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for us now to realize what revenge this class dealt to\r\nmy father for twenty-five years. Consider their power of revenge. They\r\ncould not force a loss of property or of life, it is true; they made no\r\nopen assault in the street; their 'delicacy' held itself above common\r\nvituperation. But they wielded a greater power than all these over a man\r\nwhose every accomplishment made him their equal, and they used it\r\nwithout stint. They doomed him to the slow martyrdom of social scorn.\r\nThey shut their doors against him. They elbowed him from every position\r\nto which he had a wish or a right, except public respect, and they could\r\nnot elbow him from that unless they pushed his character from its poise.\r\nThey cut him off from every friendly regard which would else have been\r\ndevotedly his, on that level of educated life, and limited him to\r\n'solitary confinement' within himself. They compelled him to walk as if\r\nunder a ban or an anathema. Had he been a leper in Syrian deserts, or a\r\ndisciple of Jesus among Pharisees, he could not have been more utterly\r\nbanished from the region of homes and self-constituted piety. They\r\nshowered ineffable contempt upon him in every way consistent with their\r\nlittleness and--refinement. Slight, sneer, insult, all the myriad\r\nindignities that only 'good society' can devise, these were what my\r\nfather received in return for his love and his work in love.\r\n\r\nHow little personal relation all this obloquy bore to him, let this\r\nstand as evidence: that he not only continued his work, but daily gave\r\nit more caustic energy and wider scope. As I have hinted, he did not, in\r\npolitical matters, give in his adherence to that class of abolitionists\r\nwho, as he thought, threw away their best chances of success in refusing\r\nto work within constitutional provisions. He was prouder that this\r\nsingle community should call him \"abolitionist,\" though it spat the word\r\nat him, than if the whole earth should hail him with the kingliest\r\ntitle; but he loved the name too well not to make it stand for some\r\npractical fact, some feasible and organized effort. He believed that our\r\nNational Constitution did, indeed, hold many compromises with Slavery,\r\nbut was framed, in the majority of its provisions and certainly in the\r\ntotality of its spirit, in the interests of freedom; and that it only\r\nneeded enforcement by the choice of the ballot-box to bring the South\r\neither to an amicable or a hostile settlement of the question. Which, he\r\ndid not ask or care. The duty of the present could not be mis-read; it\r\nwas written in _the vote_.\r\n\r\nWith these views, he gave much time and work to organizing in this\r\nState, \"The National Liberty Party,\" in 1840, and to securing from\r\nPennsylvania some of the seven thousand votes that were cast for John G.\r\nBirney in that year throughout the Union. By the time another election\r\ncame, the party had swelled its numbers to seventy thousand. To\r\ncontribute his share towards this success, tract after tract, address\r\nafter address, were written and sent broadcast; meetings were convened,\r\ncommittees formed, resolutions framed, speeches made, petitions and\r\nremonstrances sent, public action fearlessly sifted and criticised; in\r\nshort, because he held a steady faith in men's humane promptings when\r\nultimately reached, he 'cried aloud' to them by every access, and\r\n'spared not' to call them from their timidity and time-serving to manly\r\nutterance through the ballot-box.\r\n\r\nOf such appeals, his address of the \"Liberty Party of Pennsylvania, to\r\nthe people of the State,\" issued in 1844, may stand as a sample. It is a\r\nvivid portrayal of the slave power's insidious encroachments, and of its\r\nmonopolized guidance of the Government. It gathers up the national\r\nstatistics into groups, shows how new meaning is reflected from them\r\nthus related, that all unite to illustrate the single fact of the\r\nSouth's steady increase of power, her tightening grasp about the throat\r\nof government, and her buffets of threat to the North when a weedling\r\npalm failed to palsy fast enough. It warns northern voters of the\r\nundertow that is drawing them, and adjures them, by every consideration\r\nof political common sense, not to cast their ballots for either of the\r\npro-slavery candidates presented. The conclusion of this address is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR OBJECT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"And now, fellow-citizens, you may ask, what is our object in\r\n    thus exhibiting to you the alarming influence of the slave\r\n    power? Do we wish to excite in your bosoms feelings of hatred\r\n    against citizens of a common country? Do we wish to array the\r\n    Free states against the Slave states in hostile strife? No,\r\n    fellow-citizens. But we wish to show you that, while the slave\r\n    states are inferior to us in free population, having not even\r\n    one half of ours; inferior in morals, being the region of bowie\r\n    knives and duels, of assassinations and lynch law; inferior in\r\n    mental attainments, having not one-fourth of the number that can\r\n    read and write; inferior in intelligence, having not one-fifth\r\n    of the number of literary and scientific periodicals; inferior\r\n    in the products of agriculture and manufactures, of mines, of\r\n    fisheries, and of the forest; inferior, in short, in everything\r\n    that constitutes the wealth, the honor, the dignity, the\r\n    stability, the happiness, the true greatness of a nation,--it is\r\n    wrong, it is unjust, it is absurd, that they should have an\r\n    influence in all the departments of government so entirely\r\n    disproportionate to our own. We would arouse you to your own\r\n    true interests. We would have you, like men, firmly resolved to\r\n    maintain your own rights. We would have you say to the\r\n    South,--if you choose to hug to your bosom that system which is\r\n    continually injuring and impoverishing you; that system which\r\n    reduces two millions and a half of native Americans in your\r\n    midst to the most abject condition of ignorance and vice,\r\n    withholding from them the very key of knowledge; that system\r\n    which is at war with every principle of justice, every feeling\r\n    of humanity; that system which makes man the property of man,\r\n    and perpetuates that relation from one generation to another;\r\n    that system which tramples, continually, upon a majority of the\r\n    commandments of the Decalogue; that system which could not live\r\n    a day if it did not give one party supreme control over the\r\n    persons, the health, the liberty, the happiness, the marriage\r\n    relations, the parental authority and filial obligations of the\r\n    other;--if you choose to cling to such a system, cling to it;\r\n    but you shall not cross our line; you shall not bring that foul\r\n    thing here. We know, and we here repeat it for the thousandth\r\n    time to meet, for the thousandth time, the calumnies of our\r\n    enemies, that while we may present to you every consideration of\r\n    duty, we have no right, as well as no power, to alter your State\r\n    laws. But remember, that slavery is the mere creature of local\r\n    or statute law, and cannot exist out of the region where such\r\n    law has force. 'It is so odious,' says Lord Mansfield, 'that\r\n    nothing can be suffered to support it but _positive_ law.'\r\n\r\n    \"We would, therefore, say to you again, in the strength of that\r\n    Constitution under which we live, and which no where\r\n    countenances slavery, you shall not bring that foul thing here.\r\n    You shall not force the corrupted and corrupting blood of that\r\n    system into every vein and artery of our body politic. You shall\r\n    not have the controlling power in all the departments of our\r\n    government at home and abroad. You shall not so negotiate with\r\n    foreign powers, as to open markets for the products of slave\r\n    labor alone. You shall not so manage things at home, as every\r\n    few years to bring bankruptcy upon our country. You shall not,\r\n    in the apportionment of public moneys, have what you call your\r\n    'property' represented, and thus get that which, by no right,\r\n    belongs to you. You shall not have the power to bring your\r\n    slaves upon our free soil, and take them away at pleasure; nor\r\n    to reclaim them, when they, panting for liberty, have been able\r\n    to escape your grasp; for we would have it said of us, as the\r\n    eloquent Curran said of Britain, the moment the slave touches\r\n    our soil, 'The ground on which he stands is holy, and\r\n    consecrated to the Genius of UNIVERSAL EMANCIPATION.'\r\n\r\n    \"Thus, fellow-citizens, we come to _the great object of the\r\n    Liberty Party_: ABSOLUTE AND UNQUALIFIED DIVORCE OF THE GENERAL\r\n    GOVERNMENT FROM ALL CONNECTION WITH SLAVERY. We would employ\r\n    every _constitutional_ means to eradicate it from our entire\r\n    country, because it would be for the highest welfare of our\r\n    entire country. We would have liberty established in the\r\n    District, and in all the Territories.  *  *  We would have\r\n    liberty of speech and of the press, which the Constitution\r\n    guarantees to us. We would have the right of petition most\r\n    sacredly regarded. We would secure to every man what the\r\n    Constitution secures, 'The right of trial by jury.' We would do\r\n    what we can for the encouragement and improvement of the colored\r\n    race, and restore to them that inestimable right of which they\r\n    have been so meanly, as well as unjustly, deprived, the RIGHT OF\r\n    SUFFRAGE. We would look to the best interests of the country,\r\n    and the _whole_ country, and not legislate for the good of an\r\n    Oligarchy, the most arrogant that ever lorded it over an\r\n    insulted people. We would have our commercial treaties with\r\n    foreign nations regard the interests of the Free states. We\r\n    would provide safe, adequate, and permanent markets for the\r\n    produce of free labor. And, when reproached with slavery, we\r\n    would be able to say to the world, with an open front and a\r\n    clear conscience, our General Government has nothing to do with\r\n    it, either to promote, to sustain, to defend, to sanction, or to\r\n    approve.\r\n\r\n    \"Thus, fellow-citizens, you see our objects. You may now ask, by\r\n    what means we hope to attain them. We answer, by POLITICAL\r\n    ACTION. What is political action? It is _acting in a manner\r\n    appropriate to those objects which we wish to secure through the\r\n    agency of the different departments of Government_.  *  *  The\r\n    only way in which we can act _constitutionally_, is to go to the\r\n    ballot-box, and there, silently and unostentatiously, deposit a\r\n    vote for such men as will do what they can to carry out those\r\n    principles which we have so much at heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Come, then, men of Pennsylvania, come and join us in this good\r\n    work. Join us, to use such moral means as to correct public\r\n    sentiment throughout the region where slavery exists, and to\r\n    impress upon the people of the Free states a manly sense of\r\n    their own rights. Join us, to place \"just men\" in all our public\r\n    offices; men whose example a whole people may safely imitate.\r\n    Join us to free our General Government from the ignominious\r\n    reproach of slavery; to restore to our country those principles\r\n    which our fathers so labored to establish; and to hand these\r\n    principles down afresh to successive generations. It is the\r\n    cause of truth, of humanity, and of God, to which we invite your\r\n    aid. It is a cause of which you never need be ashamed. Living,\r\n    you may be thankful, and dying, you may be thankful, for having\r\n    labored in it. We have, as co-laborers with us, the noblest\r\n    allies that man can wish. Within, we have the deepest\r\n    convictions of conscience, the clearest deductions of reason;\r\n    and, all over the world, wherever man is found, the first, the\r\n    most ardent longings of the human soul. Without, we have the\r\n    happiness of nearly three millions of the human race; the honor,\r\n    as well as the best interests of our whole country; and the\r\n    universal consent of all good men whose moral vision is not\r\n    obscured by the mist of a low, misguided selfishness: while we\r\n    seem to hear, as it were, the voices of the great and the good,\r\n    the patriot and the philanthropist, of a past generation,\r\n    calling to us and cheering us on. But, above all these, and\r\n    beyond all these, we have with us the highest attributes of God,\r\n    Justice and Mercy. With such allies, and in such a cause, who\r\n    can doubt on which side the victory will ultimately rest.\r\n\r\n    \"May He who guides the destinies of nations, and without whose\r\n    aid 'they labor in vain that build,' so incline your hearts to\r\n    exert your whole influence to place in all our public offices\r\n    just and good men, that our country may be preserved, her best\r\n    interests advanced, and her institutions, free in reality as in\r\n    name, handed down to the latest posterity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIs not the love of God and man ingrained in every line of this writing?\r\nYet let us see how it was received by the most Christian (?) body in\r\nthis city.\r\n\r\nI need hardly say that my father's mind had been largely impressed, from\r\nearliest manhood, with the highest subject human thought can touch. His\r\nlibrary records his wide religious reading; but he could not see an\r\nhonest path towards the profession of any definite views till 1836. The\r\nchange wrought in him then, can best be gathered from his own simple\r\nwords (under date, 1842) written in a fly-leaf of \"The Unitarian\r\nMiscellany:\" \"Though I humbly trust that God made my trials in 1836 the\r\nmeans of bringing me to true repentance, yet I have kept these books as\r\nmonuments of what I once was, and to remind me how grateful I should be\r\nto Him for having snatched me as a 'brand from the burning,'\" Such a\r\nfaith as this, born of the spiritual travail of years, what a life it\r\nalways has for the heart that forms it! It tells not of a persuasion,\r\nbut of a conviction; a disproof of skepticism through the gathered\r\nforces of the soul; a struggle, through epochs of doubt and dismay, into\r\nan attitude of positive vital faith. Its process is the only one that\r\ngives real right to ultimate peace. In comparison with the method and\r\nmeasure of such a conviction, what matters its specific form? Self-truth\r\nis the point,--the fact for starting, the line for guiding; and as for\r\nresult, this lonely and solemn rally on the deepest within us, as it is\r\ncontinuously unfolded, must lead to a glad and solemn union with the\r\nHighest without us. Who can know unfailing inward energy except through\r\nthis new birth? It proved an ever-fresh spring of vigor to my father,\r\nand because of it he was chosen, in 1839, president of \"The Philadelphia\r\nBible Society.\" What changes were wrought in the policy of the Society,\r\nwhat numerous plans were devised and executed for multiplying its\r\noperations, how it was made a cordial alliance of all denominations,\r\nwill presently appear. This is now to be said: that, after filling his\r\noffice for five years, he found that his Anti-slavery testimony had\r\nengendered in the managers a bitterness that would seize the address of\r\n1844 for pretext, and make retaliation in his sacrifice. Thankful, for\r\nthe thousandth time, to be a sacrifice for the cause he loved, he sent\r\nin his resignation in a letter full of Christian kindness and sorrow. A\r\nshort extract will show its tone:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"One whose great heart wishes the best for humanity calls to us\r\n    from the West: 'When your Society propose to put a Bible into\r\n    every family, and yet omit all reference to the slaves; and\r\n    when, giving an account of the destitution of the land, they\r\n    make no mention of two and a half millions of people perishing\r\n    in our midst without the Scriptures, can we help feeling that\r\n    something is dreadfully wrong?' This, brethren, is a most solemn\r\n    question. It is a question which I verily believe the American\r\n    Bible Society, so far as they may have yielded, directly or\r\n    indirectly, openly or silently, to a corrupt public sentiment on\r\n    this subject, will have to answer at the bar of Him who has\r\n    declared, that, 'If ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin,'\r\n    and that 'Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of\r\n    these, ye did it not to me.' The spirit of Christianity is a\r\n    spirit of universal love and philanthropy. She looks down with\r\n    pity, and, if she could, she would look with scorn upon all the\r\n    petty distinctions that exist among men. She casts her benignant\r\n    eye abroad over the earth, and, wherever she sees man, she sees\r\n    him _as man,_ as a being made in the image of God, whether an\r\n    Indian, an African, or a Caucasian sun may shine upon him. She\r\n    stoops from heaven to raise the fallen, to bind up the\r\n    broken-hearted, to release the oppressed, to give liberty to the\r\n    captive, and to break the fetters of those that are bound. She\r\n    is marching onward with accelerated step, and, wherever she\r\n    leaves the true impress of her heavenly influence, the moral\r\n    wilderness is changed into the garden of the Lord. May it never\r\n    be ours to do what may seem to be even the slightest obstacle to\r\n    her universal sway.\r\n\r\n    \"But I have already written more than I intended. In bringing\r\n    this communication to a close, allow me to express to you\r\n    individually, and as a Board, my most sincere Christian\r\n    attachment. Whatever course any members may have taken in\r\n    relation to this matter, I must believe that they have acted\r\n    from what has seemed to them a sense of duty. Far be it from me\r\n    to impeach their motives. Time, the great test of truth, may\r\n    show them their course in a very different light from that in\r\n    which they now view it. I may, as a Christian, lament that their\r\n    views of duty are not more in unison with my own. I may, as a\r\n    man, feel heart-sickened at the diseased, the deplorably\r\n    diseased state of the public mind, in relation to two and a half\r\n    millions of my fellow-men in bondage. I may, as a citizen of a\r\n    Free state, blush at the humiliating fact, that not only the\r\n    tyranny, but the ubiquity of the slave power is everywhere so\r\n    manifest; that it has insinuated itself into our free domain to\r\n    such a degree that there seems to be as much mental Slavery in\r\n    the Free states, as there is personal in the Slave states. I may\r\n    feel all this, but I must not impeach the motives by which\r\n    others have been governed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were twenty-one managers present at the reading of this letter,\r\nand, at its conclusion, a noble friend of the slave moved that the\r\nresignation be not accepted; the motion was lost by a vote of fourteen\r\nagainst seven. It was then moved that it be accepted 'with regret:' this\r\nwas carried by the same vote! But 'with regret' was not an empty form\r\nfor easing this action to its recipient; how much it meant is seen in\r\nthe resolution that was added by unanimous acceptance:\r\n\"_Resolved_,--That this Board are mainly indebted to Professor C.D.\r\nCleveland for the prominent and influential position it has attained in\r\nthe regards of this Christian community, and that they bear an earnest\r\ntestimony to the sound judgment and unwearied zeal which have ever\r\ncharacterized the discharge of his duties in his responsible office.\"\r\nLet this tribute, coming from the bitterest personal opposition that\r\never man encountered, measure the work that extorted it. Looking at it,\r\nit will be difficult for the reader to believe that a sacrifice was made\r\nof the man to whom it refers by a representative Christian body, and\r\nmerely to sate for a time the inhuman slave-greed; yet it is only one\r\nfact out of many that might be adduced, and I have brought it forward\r\nbecause it is, in my father's words, \"a fair exponent of the position of\r\nthe Christian Church at that time upon the subject of Slavery.\"\r\nHenceforward, he ceased not to rain blows, not only at his own (the\r\nPresbyterian) denomination, but at all the organized expressions of\r\nChristian purpose,--the Sunday-School Union, the Tract Society, etc.\r\n\r\nWhile working thus by voice and pen, he was incessantly busy in personal\r\nrescue of the slave. Especially was this the case when it became the\r\nduty of every lover of his kind to defy the Fugitive Slave Law. How\r\neagerly he then sprang to aid the escape of those against whom a law of\r\nthe land impotently tried to bar the law of our common humanity! During\r\nthe years that followed the passage of this infamous bill, the position\r\nhe had attained here was of particular service. Recognized as one, who,\r\nbeing a sort of standing sacrifice, might as well continue to battle in\r\nthe front; trusted implicitly even by his bitterest foes; with such a\r\nbroad philanthropy to back his appeals; pushing straight into every\r\nbreach where work was needed; blind to everything but his one light of\r\nmoral instinct;--he became an organ for the charities of those whose\r\nsofter natures longingly whispered the cry, but could not do the cut and\r\nthrust work, of deliverance. Dr. Furness held the same position, and\r\nothers who, like him, refused to be enrolled in the 'Underground\r\nCommittee,' or in any definite Anti-Slavery organization. These men knew\r\nthat they were of greater service to the cause by being its body-guard,\r\nby standing between it and the public, by making the appeals and taking\r\nthe blows, and by affording access, pecuniary and other, of each to\r\neach.\r\n\r\nThus the times moved on--growing hotter, more difficult and dangerous,\r\nbut always working these two results: redoubling the labors of this\r\nnoble band, and shaking the city from lethargy into ferment. Men were\r\ncompelled to take sides, and but one result could follow, (the result\r\nwhich always follows when human nature is stung and quickened to find\r\nits highest instincts,) the Party of Right steadily moved to triumph.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a lesson to us in courage, it is worth while to ask, how these\r\nApostles of Freedom stood the terrible strain put upon them for so many\r\nyears. I can answer for the two of whom I write, and do not doubt that\r\nthe answer is true of the rest: This self-forgetfulness was made easy by\r\na love that filled and overfilled all their moral energies--the simple\r\nlove of man, as God's highest creation, and of his natural rights, as\r\nGod's best gift. Their work was not a mere result of will, not an\r\noutcome of faculty, not an unsupported impulse of heart. It was\r\ncharacter living itself out, an utterance of its entire unity, something\r\ndrawn from the solemn depths of those life-convictions which all the\r\npersonal and impersonal powers of a man, aglow and welded, unite in\r\nproducing. Hence, their work was not apart from them, even so far as to\r\nbe called ahead of them; nor parallel with them; it was _one_ with them\r\nby a necessary spiritual inclusion. Will and Duty ceased to be separate\r\npowers; they were transfused through the whole breadth of their human\r\nsympathies, adding to their warmth a fixity of purpose that bore them\r\nwithout a falter, through thirty years of such bitter obloquy, as, in\r\nthese latter days, only the early Anti-Slavery disciples have had to\r\nendure. These men never said, in reference to the Anti-slavery cause, _I\r\nought_ or _I will_, because they never needed to say them. The sun\r\nshines without them, and life expands without them; and here were souls\r\nas unconsciously beneficent as the one, as spontaneous in growth and\r\nshaping as the other. Theirs was not a force that moved mechanically in\r\nright lines, with limited objects before it. It did, indeed, sweep with\r\narrowy swiftness of assail on every point that offered; but when I\r\nremember that it more often pleaded than stormed, that it penetrated\r\ninto every secret recess that mercy casually opened, and gently stirred\r\ninto fuller life those roots of human feeling that can be numbed by\r\napathy but not killed even by hate, I know that it was persuasive,\r\ndiffusive, inbreathing force, an influence vital in others because an\r\neffluence vitalized from themselves.\r\n\r\nSo they stood, self-consecrated, enveloped by the love of God, permeated\r\nby the love of man,--twin Perfect Loves that cast out all dream of fear.\r\nAnd so they walked, calm as if a thousand stabs of personal insult never\r\nbrought them one of personal pain, passing through all as if nothing but\r\nthe serenest skies were above them. And, as I have said, right there is\r\none explanation of the anomaly; there _were_ the serenest skies above\r\nthem--heaven's love perpetually shining. Why should it not shine? all\r\nthe powers of the men were dedicated to rescuing the image of God on\r\nthis earth,--not man as he suffered physically, but the moral instinct\r\nthreatened with annihilation. It was sacred to them, this soul so sacred\r\nto redeeming love, but too brutalized to find its way to it. Nor merely\r\nthe slave. Their love embraced, with yet more pitying fervor, the master\r\ncompelling his spiritual nature into death, and the northern apologist\r\nletting his die; and this overmastering love of saving spiritual\r\nintegrity, was one power that made them and heart-ease hold unfailing\r\nfriends through the obloquy of those days; the other must be found in\r\nthe fact mentioned,--that neither resolve nor impulse was their spur,\r\nbut personal character moving from its depths.\r\n\r\nFrom such a motive-power as this can come no parade of results. The\r\nnature that works, proceeds from the necessary laws and forces of its\r\nbeing, and is as simple and unconscious as any other natural law or\r\nforce. Hence there are no startling epochs to record in my father's\r\nhistory, no supreme efforts; in filling the measure of daily opportunity\r\nlay his chief work. I cannot measure it by our ten fingers' counting. I\r\ncan only show a life unfolding, and, by the essential laws of its\r\ngrowth, embracing the noblest cause of its time. But if action means\r\nvivifying public sentiment decaying under insidious poison; if it\r\nincludes the doing of this amid a storm of odium that would quickly have\r\nshattered any soul irresolute for an instant; if it means incessant toil\r\nquietly performed, vast sums collected and disbursed, time sacrificed,\r\nstrength spent; if it means holding up a great iniquity to loathing by a\r\npowerful pen, and nailing moral cowardice where-ever it showed; if it be\r\nrisking livelihood by introducing the cause of the slave into every\r\nliterary work, and by mingling the school-culture of fifty future\r\nmothers, year by year, with hatred of the sin; if it means one's life in\r\none's hand, friendships yielded, society defied, and position in it\r\ncheerfully renounced; above all, if action means a wealth of goodness\r\noverliving all scorns, compelling respect from a community rebuked,\r\nfellowship from a Church charged with ungodliness, and acknowledgment of\r\nunstained repute from a public eager to blacken with scandal; if to do\r\nthus, and bear thus, and live thus, is action, then my father did act to\r\nthe full purpose of life in the struggle that freed the slave.\r\n\r\nS.M.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM WHIPPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe locality of Columbia, where Mr. Whipper resided for many years, was,\r\nas is well-known, a place of much note as a station on the Underground\r\nRail Road. The firm of Smith and Whipper (lumber merchants), was\r\nlikewise well-known throughout a wide range of country. Who, indeed,\r\namongst those familiar with the history of public matters connected with\r\nthe colored people of this country, has not heard of William Whipper?\r\nFor the last thirty years, as an able business man, it has been very\r\ngenerally admitted, that he hardly had a superior.\r\n\r\nAlthough an unassuming man, deeply engrossed with business--Anti-slavery\r\npapers, conventions, and public movements having for their aim the\r\nelevation of the colored man, have always commanded Mr. Whipper's\r\ninterest and patronage. In the more important conventions which have\r\nbeen held amongst the colored people for the last thirty years, perhaps\r\nno other colored man has been so often called on to draft resolutions\r\nand prepare addresses, as the modest and earnest William Whipper. He has\r\nworked effectively in a quiet way, although not as a public speaker. He\r\nis self-made, and well read on the subject of the reforms of the day.\r\nHaving been highly successful in his business, he is now at the age of\r\nseventy, in possession of a handsome fortune; the reward of long years\r\nof assiduous labor. He is also cashier of the Freedman's Bank, in\r\nPhiladelphia. For the last few years he has resided at New Brunswick,\r\nNew Jersey, although his property and business confine him mainly to his\r\nnative State, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nOwing to a late affliction in his family, compelling him to devote the\r\nmost of his time thereto, it has been impossible to obtain from him the\r\nmaterial for completing such a sketch as was desired. Prior to this\r\naffliction, in answer to our request, he furnished some reminiscences of\r\nhis labors as conductor of the Underground Rail Road, and at the same\r\ntime, promised other facts relative to his life, but for the reason\r\nassigned, they were not worked up, which is to be regretted.\r\n\r\n\r\n    NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., December 4, 1871.\r\n\r\n    MR. WILLIAM STILL, DEAR SIR:--I sincerely regret the absence of\r\n    statistics that would enable me to furnish you with many events,\r\n    that would assist you in describing the operations of the\r\n    Underground Rail Road. I never kept any record of those persons\r\n    passing through my hands, nor did I ever anticipate that the\r\n    history of that perilous period would ever be written. I can\r\n    only refer to the part I took in it from memory, and if I could\r\n    delineate the actual facts as they occurred they would savor so\r\n    much of egotism that I should feel ashamed to make them public.\r\n    I willingly refer to a few incidents which you may select and\r\n    use as you may think proper.\r\n\r\n    You are perfectly cognizant of the fact, that after the decision\r\n    in York, Pa., of the celebrated Prigg case, Pennsylvania was\r\n    regarded as free territory, which Canada afterwards proved to\r\n    be, and that the Susquehanna river was the recognized northern\r\n    boundary of the slave-holding empire. The borough of Columbia,\r\n    situated on its eastern bank, in the county of Lancaster, was\r\n    the great depot where the fugitives from Virginia and Maryland\r\n    first landed. The long bridge connecting Wrightsville with\r\n    Columbia, was the only safe outlet by which they could\r\n    successfully escape their pursuers. When they had crossed this\r\n    bridge they could look back over its broad silvery stream on its\r\n    western shore, and say to the slave power: \"Thus far shalt thou\r\n    come, and no farther.\" Previous to that period, the line of\r\n    fugitive travel was from Baltimore, by the way of Havre de Grace\r\n    to Philadelphia; but the difficulty of a safe passage across the\r\n    river, at that place caused the route to be changed to York,\r\n    Pa., a distance of fifty-eight miles, the fare being forty\r\n    dollars, and thence to Columbia, in the dead hour of the night.\r\n    My house was at the end of the bridge, and as I kept the\r\n    station, I was frequently called up in the night to take charge\r\n    of the passengers.\r\n\r\n    On their arrival they were generally hungry and penniless. I\r\n    have received hundreds in this condition; fed and sheltered from\r\n    one to seventeen at a time in a single night. At this point the\r\n    road forked; some I sent west by boats, to Pittsburgh, and\r\n    others to you in our cars to Philadelphia, and the incidents of\r\n    their trials form a portion of the history you have compiled. In\r\n    a period of three years from 1847 to 1850, I passed hundreds to\r\n    the land of freedom, while others, induced by high wages, and\r\n    the feeling that they were safe in Columbia, worked in the\r\n    lumber and coal yards of that place. I always persuaded them to\r\n    go to Canada, as I had no faith in their being able to elude the\r\n    grasp of the slave-hunters. Indeed, the merchants had the\r\n    confidence of their security and desired them to remain; several\r\n    of my friends told me that I was injuring the trade of the place\r\n    by persuading the laborers to leave. Indeed, many of the\r\n    fugitives themselves looked upon me with jealousy, and expressed\r\n    their indignation at my efforts to have them removed from peace\r\n    and plenty to a land that was cold and barren, to starve to\r\n    death.\r\n\r\n    It was a period of great prosperity in our borough, and\r\n    everything passed on favorably and successfully until the\r\n    passage of the fugitive slave bill in 1850. At first the law was\r\n    derided and condemned by our liberty-loving citizens, and the\r\n    fugitives did not fear its operations because they asserted that\r\n    they could protect themselves. This fatal dream was of short\r\n    duration. A prominent man, by the name of Baker, was arrested\r\n    and taken to Philadelphia, and given up by the commissioner, and\r\n    afterwards purchased by our citizens; another, by the name of\r\n    Smith, was shot dead in one of our lumber yards, because he\r\n    refused to surrender, and his pursuer permitted to escape\r\n    without arrest or trial. This produced not only a shock, but a\r\n    crisis in the affairs of our little borough. It made the\r\n    stoutest hearts quail before the unjust sovereignty of the law.\r\n    The white citizens fearing the danger of a successful resistance\r\n    to the majesty of the law, began to talk of the insecurity of\r\n    these exiles. The fugitives themselves, whose faith and hope had\r\n    been buoyed up by the promises held up to them of protection,\r\n    began to be apprehensive of danger, and talked of leaving, while\r\n    others, more bold, were ready to set the dangers that surrounded\r\n    them at defiance, and if necessary, die in the defence of their\r\n    freedom and the homes they had acquired.\r\n\r\n    At this juncture private meetings were held by the colored\r\n    people, and the discussions and resolves bore a peculiar\r\n    resemblance in sentiment and expression to the patriotic\r\n    outbursts of the American revolution.\r\n\r\n    Some were in favor, if again attacked, of killing and slaying\r\n    all within their reach; of setting their own houses on fire, and\r\n    then going and burning the town. It was the old spirit which\r\n    animated the Russians at Moscow, and the blacks of Hayti. At\r\n    this point my self-interest mingled with my sense of humanity,\r\n    and I felt that I occupied a more responsible position than I\r\n    shall ever attain to again. I, therefore, determined to make the\r\n    most of it. I exhorted them to peace and patience under their\r\n    present difficulties, and for their own sakes as well as the\r\n    innocent sufferers, besought them to leave as early as they\r\n    could. If I had advocated a different course I could have caused\r\n    the burning of the town. The result of our meeting produced a\r\n    calm, that lasted only for a few days, when it was announced,\r\n    one evening, that the claimants of a Methodist preacher, by the\r\n    name of Dorsey, were in the borough, and that it was expected\r\n    that they would attempt to take him that night.\r\n\r\n    It was about nine o'clock in the evening when I went to his\r\n    house, but was refused admittance, until those inside\r\n    ascertained who I was. There were several men in the house all\r\n    armed with deadly weapons, awaiting the approach of the\r\n    intruders. Had they come the whole party would have been\r\n    massacred. I advised Dorsey to leave, but he very pointedly\r\n    refused, saying he had been taken up once before alive, but\r\n    never would be again. The men told him to stand his ground, and\r\n    they would stand by him and defend him, they had lived together,\r\n    and would die together. I told them that they knew the strength\r\n    of the pro-slavery feeling that surrounded them, and that they\r\n    would be overpowered, and perhaps many lives lost, which might\r\n    be saved by his changing his place of residence. He said, he had\r\n    no money, and would rather die with his family, than be killed\r\n    on the road. I said, how much money do you want to start with,\r\n    and we will send you more if you need it. Here is one hundred\r\n    dollars in gold. \"That is not enough.\" \"Will two hundred dollars\r\n    do?\" \"Yes.\" I shall bring it to you to-morrow. I got the money\r\n    the next morning, and when I came with it, he said, he could not\r\n    leave unless his family was taken care of. I told him I would\r\n    furnish his family with provisions for the next six months. Then\r\n    he said he had two small houses, worth four hundred and\r\n    seventy-five dollars. My reply was that I will sell them for\r\n    you, and give the money to your family. He then gave me a power\r\n    of attorney to do so, and attended to all his affairs. He left\r\n    the next day, being the Sabbath, and has never returned since,\r\n    although he has lived in the City of Boston ever since, except\r\n    about six months in Canada.\r\n\r\n    I wish to notice this case a little further, as the only one out\r\n    of many to which I will refer. About the year 1831 or 1832, Mr.\r\n    Joseph Purvis, a younger brother of Robert Purvis, about\r\n    nineteen or twenty years of age, was visiting Mr. Stephen Smith,\r\n    of Columbia, and while there the claimants of Dorsey came and\r\n    secured him, and had proceeded about two miles with him on the\r\n    way to Lancaster. Young Purvis heard of it, and his natural and\r\n    instinctive love of freedom fired up his warm southern blood at\r\n    the very recital. He was one of nature's noblemen. Fierce,\r\n    fiery, and impulsive, he was as quick to decide as to perform.\r\n    He demanded an immediate rescue. Though he was advised of the\r\n    danger of such an attempt, his spirit and determination made him\r\n    invincible. He proceeded to a place where some colored men were\r\n    working. With a firm and determined look, and a herculean shout,\r\n    he called out to them, \"To arms, to arms! boys, we must rescue\r\n    this man; I shall lead if you will follow.\" \"We will,\" was the\r\n    immediate response. And they went and overtook them, and\r\n    dispersed his claimants. They brought Dorsey back in triumph to\r\n    Columbia.\r\n\r\n    He then gave Dorsey his pistol, with the injunction that he\r\n    should use it and die in defence of his liberty rather than\r\n    again be taken into bondage. He promised he would. I found him\r\n    with this pistol on his table, the night I called on him, and I\r\n    have every reason to believe that the promise gave to Mr. Purvis\r\n    was one of the chief causes of his obstinacy. The lesson he had\r\n    taught him had not only become incorporated in his nature, but\r\n    had become a part of his religion.\r\n\r\n    The history of this brave and noble effort of young Purvis, in\r\n    rescuing a fellow-being from the jaws of Slavery has been handed\r\n    down, in Columbia, to a generation that was born since that\r\n    event has transpired. He always exhibited the same devotion and\r\n    manly daring in the cause of the flying bondman that inspired\r\n    his youthful ardor in behalf of freedom. The youngest of a\r\n    family distinguished for their devotion to freedom, he was\r\n    without superiors in the trying hour of battle. Like John Brown,\r\n    he often discarded theories, but was eminently practical. He has\r\n    passed to another sphere. Peace to his ashes! I honor his name\r\n    as a hero, and friend of man. I loved him for the noble\r\n    characteristics of his nature, and above all for his noble\r\n    daring in defense of the right. As a friend I admired him, and\r\n    owe his memory this tribute to departed worth.\r\n\r\n    At this point a conscientious regard for truth dictates that I\r\n    should state that my disposition to make a sacrifice for the\r\n    removal of Dorsey and some other leading spirits was aided by my\r\n    own desire for  _self-preservation._\r\n\r\n    I knew that it had been asserted, far down in the slave region,\r\n    that Smith & Whipper, the negro lumber merchants, were engaged\r\n    in secreting fugitive slaves. And on two occasions attempts had\r\n    been made to set fire to their yard for the purpose of punishing\r\n    them for such illegal acts. And I felt that if a collision took\r\n    place, we should not only be made to suffer the penalty, but the\r\n    most valuable property in the village be destroyed, besides a\r\n    prodigal waste of human life be the consequence. In such an\r\n    event I felt that I should not only lose all I had ever earned,\r\n    but peril the hopes and property of others, so that I would have\r\n    freely given one thousand dollars to have been insured against\r\n    the consequences of such a riot. I then borrowed fourteen\r\n    hundred dollars on my own individual account, and assisted many\r\n    others to go to a land where the virgin soil was not polluted by\r\n    the foot-prints of a slave.\r\n\r\n    The colored population of the Borough of Columbia, in 1850, was\r\n    nine hundred and forty-three, about one-fifth the whole\r\n    population, and in five years they were reduced to four hundred\r\n    and eighty-seven by emigration to Canada.\r\n\r\n    In the summer of 1853, I visited Canada for the purpose of\r\n    ascertaining the actual condition of many of those I had\r\n    assisted in reaching a land of freedom; and I was much gratified\r\n    to find them contented, prosperous, and happy. I was induced by\r\n    the prospects of the new emigrants to purchase lands on the\r\n    Sydenham River, with the intention of making it my future home.\r\n\r\n    In the spring of 1861, when I was preparing to leave, the war\r\n    broke out, and with its progress I began to realize the prospect\r\n    of a new civilization, and, therefore, concluded to remain and\r\n    share the fortunes of my hitherto ill-fated country.\r\n\r\n    I will say in conclusion that it would have been fortunate for\r\n    us if Columbia, being a port of entry for flying fugitives, had\r\n    been also the seat of great capitalists and freedom-loving\r\n    inhabitants; but such was not the case. There was but little\r\n    Anti-slavery sentiment among the whites, yet there were many\r\n    strong and valiant friends among them who contributed freely;\r\n    the colored population were too poor to render much aid, except\r\n    in feeding and secreting strangers. I was doing a prosperous\r\n    business at that time and felt it my duty to contribute\r\n    liberally out of my earnings. Much as I loved Anti-slavery\r\n    meetings I did not feel that I could afford to attend them, as\r\n    my immediate duty was to the flying fugitive.\r\n\r\n    Now, my friend, I have extended this letter far beyond the\r\n    limits intended, not with the expectation that it will be\r\n    published, but for your own private use to select any matter\r\n    that you might desire to use in your history. I have to regret\r\n    that I am compelled to refer so often to my own exertions.\r\n\r\n    I know that I speak within bounds when I say that directly and\r\n    indirectly from 1847 to 1860, I have contributed from my\r\n    earnings one thousand dollars annually, and for the five years\r\n    during the war a like amount to put down the rebellion.\r\n\r\n    Now the slaves are emancipated, and we are all enfranchised,\r\n    after struggling for existence, freedom and manhood--I feel\r\n    thankful for having had the glorious privilege of laboring with\r\n    others for the redemption of my race from oppression and\r\n    thraldom; and I would prefer to-day to be penniless in the\r\n    streets, rather than to have withheld a single hour's labor or a\r\n    dollar from the sacred cause of liberty, justice, and humanity.\r\n\r\n    I remain yours in the sacred cause of liberty and equality,\r\n\r\n    WM. WHIPPER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISAAC T. HOPPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distinctive characteristics of this individual were so admirably\r\nportrayed in the newspapers and other periodicals published at the time\r\nof his death, that we shall make free use of them without hesitation. He\r\nwas distinguished from his early life by his devotion to the relief of\r\nthe oppressed colored race. He was an active member of the old\r\nPennsylvania Abolition Society, and labored zealously with Dr. Benjamin\r\nRush, Dr. Rogers, Dr. Wistar, and other distinguished philanthropists of\r\nthe time. No man at that day, not even eminent judges and advocates, was\r\nbetter acquainted with the intricacies of law questions connected with\r\nslavery. His accurate legal knowledge, his natural acuteness, his ready\r\ntact in avoiding dangerous corners and slipping through unseen\r\nloop-holes, often gave him the victory in cases that seemed hopeless to\r\nother minds. In many of these cases, physical courage was needed as much\r\nas moral firmness; and he possessed these qualities in a very unusual\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nBeing for many years an inspector of the public prisons, his practical\r\nsagacity and benevolence were used with marked results. His enlarged\r\nsympathies had always embraced the criminal and the imprisoned, as well\r\nas the oppressed; and the last years of his life were especially devoted\r\nto the improvement of prisons and prisoners. In this department of\r\nbenevolence he manifested the same zealous kindness and untiring\r\ndiligence that had so long been exerted for the colored people, for\r\nwhose welfare he labored to the end of his days.\r\n\r\nHe possessed a wonderful wisdom in furnishing relief to all who were in\r\ndifficulty and embarrassment. This caused a very extensive demand upon\r\nhis time and talents, which were rarely withheld when honestly sought,\r\nand seldom applied in vain.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kirkland prepared, under the title of \"The Helping Hand,\" a small\r\nvolume, for the benefit of \"The Home\" for discharged female convicts,\r\ncontaining a brief description of the institution, and a detail of facts\r\nillustrating the happy results of its operation. Its closing chapter is\r\nappropriately devoted to the following well-deserved tribute to the\r\nveteran philanthropist, to whose zeal and discretion that and so many\r\nother similar institutions owe their existence, or to a large degree\r\ntheir prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Not to inform the public what it knows very well already, nor\r\n    to forestall the volume now preparing by Mrs. Child, a kindred\r\n    spirit, but to gratify my own feelings, and to give grace and\r\n    sanctity to this little book, I wish to say a few words of Mr.\r\n    Hopper, the devoted friend of the prisoner as of the slave; one\r\n    whose long life, and whose last thoughts, were given to the care\r\n    and succor of human weakness, error, and suffering. To make even\r\n    the most unpretending book for the benefit of 'The Home,'\r\n    without bringing forward the name of Isaac T. Hopper, and\r\n    recognizing the part he took in its affairs, from the earliest\r\n    moment of its existence until the close of his life, would be an\r\n    unpardonable omission. A few words must be said where a volume\r\n    would scarcely suffice.\r\n\r\n    \"'The rich and the poor meet together, and the Lord is the\r\n    Father of them all,' might stand for the motto of Mr. Hopper's\r\n    life. That the most remote of these two classes stood on the\r\n    same level of benevolent interest in his mind, his whole career\r\n    made obvious; he was the last man to represent as naturally\r\n    opposite those whom God has always, even to the end of the\r\n    world, made mutually dependent. He told the simple truth to each\r\n    with equal frankness; helped both with equal readiness. The\r\n    palace owed him no more than the hovel suggested thoughts of\r\n    superiority. Nothing human, however grand, or however degraded,\r\n    was a stranger to him. In the light that came to him from\r\n    heaven, all stood alike children of the Great Father; earthly\r\n    distinction disappearing the moment the sinking soul or the\r\n    suffering body was in question. No amount of depravity could\r\n    extinguish his hope of reform; no recurrence of ingratitude\r\n    could paralyze his efforts. Early and late, supported or\r\n    unsupported, praised or ridiculed, he went forward in the great\r\n    work of relief, looking neither to the right hand, nor to the\r\n    left; and when the object was accomplished, he shrank back into\r\n    modest obscurity, only to wait till a new necessity called for\r\n    his reappearance. Who can number the poor, aching, conscious,\r\n    despairing hearts that have felt new life come to them from his\r\n    kind words, his benignant smile, his helping hand. If the record\r\n    of his long life could be fully written, which it can never be,\r\n    since every day and all day, in company, in the family circle,\r\n    with children, with prisoners, with the insane, 'virtue went out\r\n    of him' that no human observation could measure or describe,\r\n    what touching interest would be added to the history of our poor\r\n    and vicious population for more than half a century past; what\r\n    new honor and blessing would surround the venerated name of our\r\n    departed friend and leader!\r\n\r\n    \"But he desired nothing of this. Without claiming for him a\r\n    position above humanity, which alone would account for a\r\n    willingness to be wholly unrecognized as a friend of the\r\n    afflicted, it is not too much to say that no man was ever less\r\n    desirous of public praise or outward honor. He was even\r\n    unwilling that any care should be taken to preserve the\r\n    remembrance of his features, sweet and beautiful as they were,\r\n    though he was brought reluctantly to yield to the anxious wish\r\n    of his children and friends that the countenance on which every\r\n    eye loved to dwell, should not be wholly lost when the grave\r\n    should close above it. He loved to talk of interesting cases of\r\n    reform and recovery, both because those things occupied his\r\n    mind, and because every one loved to hear him; but the hearer\r\n    who made these disclosures the occasion for unmeaning\r\n    compliment, as if he fancied a craving vanity to have prompted\r\n    them, soon found himself rebuked by the straightforward and\r\n    plain-spoken patriarch. Precious indeed were those seasons of\r\n    outpouring, when one interesting recital suggested another, till\r\n    the listener seemed to see the whole mystery of prison-life and\r\n    obscure wretchedness laid open before him with the distinctness\r\n    of a picture. For, strange as it may seem, our friend had under\r\n    his plain garb--unchanged in form since the days of Franklin, to\r\n    go no further back--a fine dramatic talent, and could not relate\r\n    the humblest incident without giving it a picturesque or\r\n    dramatic turn, speaking now for one character, now for another,\r\n    with a variety and discrimination very remarkable. This made his\r\n    company greatly sought, and as his strongly social nature\r\n    readily responded, his acquaintance was very large. To every one\r\n    that knew him personally, I can appeal for the truth and\r\n    moderation of these views of his character and manners.\r\n\r\n    \"A few biographical items will close what I venture to offer\r\n    here.\r\n\r\n    \"Isaac T. Hopper was born December 3, 1771, in the township of\r\n    Deptford, Gloucester county, New Jersey, but spent a large\r\n    portion of his life in Philadelphia, where he served his\r\n    apprenticeship to the humble calling of a tailor. But neither\r\n    the necessity for constant occupation nor the temptations of\r\n    youthful gaiety, prevented his commencing, even then, the\r\n    devotion of a portion of his time, to the care of the poor and\r\n    needy. He had scarcely reached man's estate when we find him an\r\n    active member of a benevolent association, and his volume, of\r\n    notes of cases, plans and efforts, date back to that early\r\n    period. To that time also, we are to refer the beginning of his\r\n    warm Anti-slavery sentiment, a feeling so prominent and\r\n    effective throughout his life, and the source of some of his\r\n    noblest efforts and sacrifices. For many years he served as\r\n    inspector of prisons in Philadelphia, and thus, by long and\r\n    constant practical observation, was accumulated that knowledge\r\n    of the human heart in its darkest windings, that often\r\n    astonished the objects of his care, when they thought they had\r\n    been able cunningly to blind his eyes to their real character\r\n    and intentions. After his removal to New York, and when the\r\n    occasion for his personal labors in the cause of the slave had\r\n    in some measure, ceased or slackened, he threw his whole heart\r\n    into the Prison Association, whose aims and plans of action were\r\n    entirely in accordance with his views, and indeed, in a great\r\n    degree, based on his experience and advice. The intent of the\r\n    Prison Association is threefold: first to protect and defend\r\n    those who are arrested, and who, as is well known, often suffer\r\n    greatly from want of honest and intelligent counsel; secondly,\r\n    to attend to the treatment and instruction of convicts while in\r\n    prison; and thirdly, on their discharge to render them such\r\n    practical aid as shall enable the repentant to return to society\r\n    by means of the pursuit of some honest calling. The latter\r\n    branch occupied Mr. Hopper's time and attention, and he devoted\r\n    himself to it with an affectionate and religious earnestness\r\n    that ceased only with his life. No disposition was too perverse\r\n    for his efforts at reform; no heart was so black that he did not\r\n    at least try the balm of healing upon it; no relapses could tire\r\n    out his patience, which, without weak waste of means still\r\n    apostolically went on 'hoping all things,' while even a dying\r\n    spark of good feeling remained.\r\n\r\n    Up to February last did this venerable saint continue his\r\n    abundant labors; when a severe cold, co-operating with the decay\r\n    of nature, brought him his sentence of dismissal. He felt that\r\n    it was on the way, and with the serious grace that marked\r\n    everything he did, he began at once to gather his earthly robes\r\n    about him and prepare for the great change which no one could\r\n    dread less. It was hard for those who saw his ruddy cheek and\r\n    sparkling eye, his soft brown hair, and sprightly movements to\r\n    feel that the time of his departure was drawing nigh: but he\r\n    knew and felt it, with more composure than his friends could\r\n    summon. It might well be said of this our beloved patriarch,\r\n    that his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. To the\r\n    last of his daily journeyings through the city, for which he\r\n    generally used the rail road, he would never allow the drivers\r\n    to stop for him to get on or off the car, feeling, as he used\r\n    smilingly to observe, 'very jealous on that point.' Few ever\r\n    passed him in the street without asking who he was; for not only\r\n    did his primitive dress, his broad-brimmed hat, and his antique\r\n    shoe buckles attract attention, but the beauty and benevolence\r\n    of his face was sure to fix the eye of ordinary discernment. He\r\n    was a living temperance lecture, and those who desire to\r\n    preserve good looks could not ask a more infallible receipt,\r\n    than that sweet temper and out-flowing benevolence which made\r\n    his countenance please every eye. Gay and cheerful as a boy, he\r\n    had ever some pleasant anecdote or amusing turn to relate, and\r\n    in all perhaps not one without a moral bearing, not thrust\r\n    forward, but left to be picked out by the hearer at his leisure.\r\n    He seemed born to show how great strictness in essentials could\r\n    exist without the least asceticism in trifles. Anything but a\r\n    Simeon Stylites in his sainthood, he could go among 'publicans\r\n    and sinners' without the least fear of being mistaken by them\r\n    for one of themselves. An influence radiated from him that made\r\n    itself felt in every company, though he would very likely be the\r\n    most modest man present. More gentlemanly manners and address no\r\n    court in Christendom need require; his resolute simplicity and\r\n    candor, always under the guidance of a delicate taste, never for\r\n    a moment degenerated into coarseness or disregard even of the\r\n    prejudices of others. His life, even in these minute\r\n    particulars, showed how the whole man is harmonized by the sense\r\n    of being\r\n\r\n\r\n        'Ever in the Great Taskmaster's eye.'\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"He died on the 7th of May, 1852, in his eighty-first year, and\r\n    a public funeral in the Tabernacle brought together thousands\r\n    desirous of showing respect to his memory.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Child has written a full, and in many respects, an exceedingly\r\ninteresting biography of the subject of this memoir, towards the close\r\nof which she says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"From the numerous notices in papers of all parties and sects, I\r\n    will merely quote the following. 'The New York Observer' thus\r\n    announces his death:\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"'The venerable Isaac T. Hopper, whose placid,\r\n        benevolent face has so long irradiated almost every\r\n        public meeting for doing good, and whose name,\r\n        influence, and labors, have been devoted with an\r\n        apostolic simplicity and constancy to humanity, died on\r\n        Friday last, at an advanced age. He was a Quaker of that\r\n        early sort illustrated by such philanthropists as\r\n        Anthony Benezet, Thomas Clarkson, Mrs. Fry, and the\r\n        like.\r\n\r\n        \"'He was a most self-denying, patient, loving friend of\r\n        the poor, and the suffering of every kind; and his life\r\n        was an unbroken history of beneficence. Thousands of\r\n        hearts will feel a touch of grief at the news of his\r\n        death; for few men have so large a wealth in the\r\n        blessings of the poor, and the grateful remembrance of\r\n        kindness and benevolence, as he.'\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"'The New York Times' contained the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"'Most of our readers will call to mind, in connection\r\n        with the name of Isaac T. Hopper, the compact, well-knit\r\n        figure of a Quaker gentleman, apparently about sixty\r\n        years of age, dressed in drab or brown clothes of the\r\n        plainest cut, and bearing on his handsome, manly face\r\n        the impress of that benevolence with which his whole\r\n        heart was filled.\r\n\r\n        \"'He was twenty years older than he seemed. The fountain\r\n        of benevolence within freshened his old age with its\r\n        continuous flow. The step of the octogenarian was\r\n        elastic as that of a boy, his form erect as a mountain\r\n        pine.\r\n\r\n        \"'His whole physique was a splendid sample of nature's\r\n        handiwork. We see him now with our mind's eye, but with\r\n        the eye of flesh we shall see him no more. Void of\r\n        intentional offence to God or man, his spirit has joined\r\n        its happy kindred in a world where there is neither\r\n        sorrow nor perplexity.'\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I sent the following communication to 'The New York Tribune':\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"In this world of shadows, few things strengthen the\r\n        soul like seeing the calm and cheerful exit of a truly\r\n        good man; and this has been my privilege by the bedside\r\n        of Isaac T. Hopper.\r\n\r\n        \"He was a man of remarkable endowments, both of head and\r\n        heart. His clear discrimination, his unconquerable will,\r\n        his total unconsciousness of fear, his extraordinary\r\n        tact in circumventing plans he wished to frustrate,\r\n        would have made him illustrious as the general of an\r\n        army; and these qualities might have become faults, if\r\n        they had not been balanced by an unusual degree of\r\n        conscientiousness and benevolence. He battled\r\n        courageously, not from ambition, but from an inborn love\r\n        of truth. He circumvented as adroitly as the most\r\n        practiced politician; but it was always to defeat the\r\n        plans of those who oppressed God's poor; never to\r\n        advance his own self-interest.\r\n\r\n        \"'Few men have been more strongly attached to any\r\n        religious society than he was to the Society of Friends,\r\n        which he joined in the days of its purity, impelled by\r\n        his own religious convictions. But when the time came\r\n        that he must either be faithless to duty in the cause of\r\n        his enslaved brethren, or part company with the Society\r\n        to which he was bound by the strong and sacred ties of\r\n        early religious feeling, this sacrifice he also calmly\r\n        laid on the altar of humanity.\r\n\r\n        \"'During nine years that I lived in his household, my\r\n        respect and affection for him continually increased.\r\n        Never have I seen a man who so completely fulfilled the\r\n        Scripture injunction, to forgive an erring brother, 'not\r\n        only seven times, but seventy times seven.' I have\r\n        witnessed relapse after relapse into vice, under\r\n        circumstances which seemed like the most heartless\r\n        ingratitude to him; but he joyfully hailed the first\r\n        symptom of repentance, and was always ready to grant a\r\n        new probation.\r\n\r\n        \"'Farewell, thou brave and kind old Friend! The prayers\r\n        of ransomed ones ascended to Heaven for thee, and a\r\n        glorious company have welcomed thee to the Eternal\r\n        City.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL D. BURRIS,\r\n\r\n\r\nReferred to by John Hunn, was also a brave conductor on the Underground\r\nRail Road leading down into Maryland (via Hunn's place). Mr. Burris was\r\na native of Delaware, but being a free man and possessing more than\r\nusual intelligence, and withal an ardent love of liberty, he left\r\n\"slave-dom\" and moved with his family to Philadelphia. Here his\r\nabhorrence of Slavery was greatly increased, especially after becoming\r\nacquainted with the Anti-slavery Office and the Abolition doctrine.\r\nUnder whose auspices or by what influence he was first induced to visit\r\nthe South with a view of aiding slaves to escape, the writer does not\r\nrecollect; nevertheless, from personal knowledge, prior to 1851, he well\r\nknew that Burris was an accredited agent on the road above alluded to,\r\nand that he had been considered a safe, wise, and useful man in his day\r\nand calling. Probably the simple conviction that he would not otherwise\r\nbe doing as he would be done by actuated him in going down South\r\noccasionally to assist some of his suffering friends to get the yokes\r\noff their necks, and with him escape to freedom. A number were thus\r\naided by Burris. But finally he found himself within the fatal snare;\r\nthe slave-holders caught him at last, and Burris was made a prisoner in\r\nDover jail. His wife and children were thereby left without their\r\nprotector and head. The friends of the slave in Philadelphia and\r\nelsewhere deeply sympathized with him in this dreadful hour. Being able\r\nto use the pen, although he could not write without having his letters\r\ninspected, he kept up a constant correspondence with his friends both in\r\nDelaware and Philadelphia. John Hunn and Thomas Garrett were as faithful\r\nto him as brothers. After lying in prison for many months, his trial\r\ncame on and Slavery gained the victory. The court decided that he must\r\nbe sold in or out of the State to serve for seven years. No change,\r\npardon or relief, could be expected from the spirit and power that held\r\nsway over Delaware at that time.\r\n\r\nThe case was one of great interest to Mr. McKim, as indeed to the entire\r\nExecutive Committee of the Pennsylvania Anti-slavery Society, who felt\r\nconstrained to do all they could to save the poor man from his\r\nthreatened fate, although they had not advised or encouraged him in the\r\nact for which he was condemned and about to suffer. In viewing his\r\ncondition, but a faint ray of hope was entertained from one single\r\ndirection. It was this: to raise money privately and have a man at the\r\nauction on the day of sale to purchase him.\r\n\r\nJohn Hunn and Thomas Garrett were too well known as Abolitionists to\r\nundertake this mission. A friend indeed, was desirable, but none other\r\nwould do than such an one as would not be suspected. Mr. McKim thought\r\nthat a man who might be taken for a negro trader would be the right kind\r\nof a man to send on this errand. Garrett and Hunn being consulted\r\nheartily acquiesced in this plan, and after much reflection and inquiry,\r\nIsaac S. Flint, an uncompromising abolitionist, living in Wilmington,\r\nDelaware, was elected to buy Burris at the sale, providing that he was\r\nnot run up to a figure exceeding the amount in hand.\r\n\r\nFlint's abhorrence of Slavery combined with his fearlessness, cool\r\nbearing, and perfect knowledge from what he had read of the usages of\r\ntraders at slave sales, without question admirably fitted him to play\r\nthe part of a trader for the time being.\r\n\r\nWhen the hour arrived, the doomed man was placed on the auction-block.\r\nTwo traders from Baltimore were known to be present; how many others the\r\nfriends of Burris knew not. The usual opportunity was given to traders\r\nand speculators to thoroughly examine the property on the block, and\r\nmost skillfully was Burris examined from the soles of his feet to the\r\ncrown of his head; legs, arms and body, being handled as horse-jockies\r\ntreat horses. Flint watched the ways of the traders and followed for\r\neffect their example. The auctioneer began and soon had a bid of five\r\nhundred dollars. A Baltimore trader was now in the lead, when Flint, if\r\nwe mistake not, bought off the trader for one hundred dollars. The bids\r\nwere thus suddenly checked, and Burris was knocked down to Isaac S.\r\nFlint (a strange trader). Of course he had left his abolition name at\r\nhome and had adopted one suited to the occasion. When the crier's hammer\r\nindicated the last bid, although Burris had borne up heroically\r\nthroughout the trying ordeal, he was not by any means aware of the fact\r\nthat he had fallen into the hands of friends, but, on the contrary,\r\nevidently labored under the impression that his freedom was gone. But a\r\nfew moments were allowed to pass ere Flint had the bill of sale for his\r\nproperty, and the joyful news was whispered in the ear of Burris that\r\nall was right; that he had been bought with abolition gold to save him\r\nfrom going south. Once more Burris found himself in Philadelphia with\r\nhis wife and children and friends, a stronger opponent than ever of\r\nSlavery. Having thus escaped by the skin of his teeth, he never again\r\nventured South.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining a year or two in Philadelphia, about the year 1852 he\r\nwent to California to seek more lucrative employment than he had\r\nhitherto found. Becoming somewhat satisfactorily situated he sent for\r\nhis family, who joined him. In the meanwhile, his interest in the cause\r\nof freedom did not falter; he always kept posted on the subject of the\r\nUnderground Rail Road and Anti-slavery questions; and after the war,\r\nwhen appeals were made on behalf of contrabands who flocked into\r\nWashington daily in a state of utter destitution, Burris was among the\r\nfirst to present the matter to the colored churches of San Francisco,\r\nwith a view of raising means to aid in this good work, and as the\r\nresult, a handsome collection was taken up and forwarded to the proper\r\ncommittee in Washington.\r\n\r\nAbout three years ago, Samuel D. Burris died, in the city of San\r\nFrancisco, at about the age of sixty years. To the slave he had been a\r\ntrue friend, and had labored faithfully for the improvement of his own\r\nmind as well as the general elevation of his race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIANN, GRACE ANNA, AND ELIZABETH R. LEWIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNear Kimberton, in Chester county, Pa., was the birth-place, and, till\r\nwithin a few years, the home of three sisters, Mariann, Grace Anna and\r\nElizabeth R. Lewis, who were among the most faithful, devoted, and\r\nquietly efficient workers in the Anti-slavery cause, including that\r\ndepartment of it which is the subject of this volume.\r\n\r\nBirth-right members of the Society of Friends, they were born into more\r\nthan the traditional Anti-slavery faith and feeling of that Society. A\r\ndeep abhorrence of slavery, and an earnest will to put that feeling into\r\nact, as opportunity should serve, were in the very life-blood which they\r\ndrew from father and mother both.\r\n\r\nLeft fatherless at an early age, they were taught by their mother to\r\nremember that their father, on his visits to their maternal grandfather,\r\nliving then in Maryland, was wont, as he expressed it, to feel the black\r\nshadow of slavery over his spirit, from the time he entered, till he\r\nleft, the State; and that, on his death-bed, he had regretted having let\r\nill-health prevent his meeting with, and joining one of the Anti-slavery\r\nSocieties of that day. Of the mother's share in the transmission of\r\ntheir hereditary feeling, it is enough, to all acquainted with the\r\nhistory of Anti-slavery work in Pennsylvania, to say that she was\r\nsister, not by blood alone, but in heart and soul, to that early,\r\nactive, untiring abolitionist, Dr. Bartholomew Fussell.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that the children of such parents, growing up under\r\nthe influence of such a mother, needed no conversion, no sacrifices of\r\nprejudice or hostile opinions, to make them Anti-slavery; but were\r\nready, simply as a matter of course, to work for the good cause whenever\r\nany way appeared in which their work could serve it. What was called\r\n\"modern abolitionism,\" as distinguished from the less aggressive form of\r\nopposition to slavery, which preceded the movement pioneered by\r\nGarrison, they at once accepted, as soon as it was set before them,\r\nthrough the agents of the American Anti-Slavery Society, in the campaign\r\nin Pennsylvania, begun in 1836. Regarding it but as the next step\r\nforward in the way they had already entered, they instinctively fell\r\ninto line with the new movement, assisted in forming a society auxiliary\r\nto it, in their own neighborhood, and were constant to the end in\r\nworking for its advancement.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARNEST IN THE CAUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRACE ANNE LEWIS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. FRANCIS E. W. HARPER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN NEEDLES.]\r\n\r\nAuxiliary to the influences already mentioned, was a very early\r\nrecollection of seeing a colored man, Henry, bound with ropes and\r\ncarried off to slavery. Grace Anna, not more than four or five years old\r\nat the time, declared that the man's face of agony is before her now;\r\nnor is it likely that her sisters were impressed less deeply. Of natures\r\nkeenly sensitive, they hated slavery, from that hour, as only children\r\nof such natures can; and--as yet too young and immature for that charity\r\nto have been developed in them, which can see a brother even in the\r\nevil-doer, and pity while condemning him,--they even more intensely\r\nhated, while they feared, the actors in the outrage, and despised the\r\ngirl who had betrayed the victim. Ever after, any one of them could be\r\ntrusted to be faithful to the hunted fugitive, though an army of\r\nkidnappers might surround her.\r\n\r\nAnother of their early recollections was of a white handkerchief which\r\nwas to be waved from a back window, as a signal of danger, to a colored\r\nman at work in a wood near by. And, all the while, the feelings aroused\r\nby such events were kept alive by little Anti-slavery poems, which they\r\nwere wont to learn by heart and recite in the evenings. Grace Anna, on\r\nher first visit to Philadelphia, when nine years old, bought a copy of\r\none of these, entitled \"Zambo's Story,\" pleased to recognize in it a\r\nfavorite of her still earlier childhood.\r\n\r\nBy means like these they were unconsciously preparing themselves for the\r\npredestined tasks of their after-life; and if there were danger that\r\nsuch a strain upon their sympathies, as they often underwent, might\r\nprove unhealthful, it was fully counteracted by ball-playing, and all\r\nkinds of active out-door amusements of childhood, so that it was never\r\nknown to result in harm.\r\n\r\nAs time passed on, their home, always open to fugitives, became an\r\nimportant centre of Underground Rail Road operations for the region\r\nextending from Wilmington, Del., into Adams county, Pa.; and they, grown\r\nto womanhood, had glided into the management of its very considerable\r\nbusiness. They received passengers from Thomas Garrett, and sometimes\r\nothers, perhaps, of Wilmington, when it was thought unsafe to send them\r\nthence directly through Philadelphia; from Wm. and Phebe Wright, in\r\nAdams county, and from friends, more than we have room to name, in York,\r\nColumbia, and the southern parts of Lancaster and Chester counties; the\r\nseveral lines, from Adams county to Wilmington, converging upon the\r\nhouse of John Vickers, of Lionville, whose wagon, laden apparently with\r\ninnocent-looking earthen ware from his pottery, sometimes conveyed,\r\nunseen beneath the visible load, a precious burden of Southern chattels,\r\non their way to manhood.\r\n\r\n[At a later period, the trains from Adams county generally took another\r\ncourse, going to Harrisburg, and on to Canada, by way of the Susquehanna\r\nValley; though still, when pursuit that way was apprehended, the former\r\ncourse was taken.]\r\n\r\nThese passengers, the Lewises forwarded in diverse ways; usually, in the\r\nearlier times, by wagon or carriage, to Richard Moore, of Quakertown, in\r\nBucks county, about thirty miles distant; but later, when abolitionists\r\nwere more numerous, and easier stages could be safely made, either\r\ndirectly to the writer, or to one or other of ten or twelve stations\r\nwhich had become established at places less remote, in the counties of\r\nChester and Montgomery. During portions of the time, their married\r\nsister Rebecca, and her husband, Edwin Fussell, and their uncle, Dr. B.\r\nFussell, and, after him, his brother William, lived on farms adjoining\r\ntheirs, and were their active helpers in this work.\r\n\r\nThe receiving and passing on of fugitives, was not all they had to do.\r\nOften it was necessary to fit out whole families with clothing suitable\r\nfor the journey. In cases of emergency they would sometimes gather a\r\nsewing-circle from such neighboring families as could be trusted; and,\r\nwith its help, accomplish rapidly the needed work. One instance is\r\nremembered, of a woman, with her little boy, whom they put into girls'\r\nattire; and, changing also the woman's dress, sent both, by cars, to\r\nCanada, accompanied by a friend. In this kind of work, too, they had\r\ngenerous aid from friends at neighboring stations. From Lawrenceville\r\nand Limerick, and Pottstown and Pughtown, came contributions of\r\nclothing; at one time a supply which filled compactly three three-bushel\r\nbags, and of which a small remainder, still on hand when slavery was\r\nabolished, was sent South to the freedmen.\r\n\r\nThe prudence, skill, and watchful care with which the business was\r\nconducted, are well attested by the fact that, so far as can be\r\nremembered, during all the many years of their connection with the\r\nUnderground Rail Road, not a plan miscarried, and not a slave that\r\nreached their station was retaken; although among their neighbors there\r\nwere bitter adversaries of the Anti-slavery cause, eager to find\r\noccasion for hostile acts against any abolitionist; and, at times,\r\nespecially vindictive against the noble sisters, because of their\r\neffective co-operation with other friends of Temperance, in preventing\r\nthe licensing of a liquor-selling tavern in the neighborhood. On one\r\noccasion, when, within a week, they had passed on to freedom no less\r\nthan forty fugitives, eleven of whom had been in the house at once, they\r\nwere amused at hearing a remark by some of their pro-slavery neighbors,\r\nto the effect that \"there used to be a pretty brisk trade of running off\r\nniggers, but there was not much of it done now.\"\r\n\r\nThough parties of four, five or six sometimes arrived in open day, they\r\nseldom sent any away till about nightfall or later, and, whenever the\r\ndanger was greater than usual, the coming was also at night. The\r\nfugitives, in attempting to capture whom, Gorsuch was killed, near\r\nChristiana, were brought to them at midnight, by Dr. Fussell; and in\r\nthis case such caution was observed, that not even the hired girl knew\r\nof the presence of persons not of the family.\r\n\r\nFor one reason or another,--perhaps to let a hot pursuit go by; perhaps\r\nto allow opportunity for recovering from fatigue and recruiting\r\nexhausted strength, or for earning means to pursue the journey by the\r\ncommon railroads,--it was often thought advisable that passengers should\r\nremain with them for a considerable period; and numbers of these were,\r\nat different times, employed as laborers in some capacity. Grace Anna\r\ntestifies that some of the best assistants they ever had in the house or\r\non the farm, were these escaped slaves; that in general they were\r\nthrifty and economical, one man, for instance, who spent several years\r\nwith them, having accumulated five hundred dollars before he went on to\r\nCanada; and another, enough to furnish an old coat with a full set of\r\nbuttons, each of which was a golden half-eagle, covered with cloth, and\r\nfirmly sewed on, besides an ample supply of good clothing for himself\r\nand his wife; and that, almost without exception, they were honest and\r\nloyal to their benefactors, and only too happy to find opportunities of\r\nshowing their gratitude. One man sent back to the sisters a letter of\r\nthanks, through a gentleman in England, whither he had gone. And once,\r\nwhen Grace Anna was passing an elegant mansion in Philadelphia, a\r\ncolored woman rushed out upon her with such an impetuous demonstration\r\nof affection, joy, and thankfulness--all thought of fitness of time and\r\nplace swept away by the swell of strong emotion--as might well have\r\namused, or slightly astonished, the passers in the street, who knew not\r\nthat in her arms the woman's child had died. But it is no marvel that to\r\nher the memory of that poor runaway slave-woman's true affection is more\r\nthan could have been the warmest welcome from her educated and refined\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\nOne case, of which the sisters for a time had charge, seems worthy of a\r\nsomewhat more extended mention. In the fall of 1855 a slave named\r\nJohnson, who, in fleeing from bondage, had come as far as Wilmington,\r\nthinking he saw his master on the train by which he was journeying\r\nnorthward, sprang from the car and hurt his foot severely. The Kennett\r\nabolitionists having taken him in hand, and fearing that suspicious eyes\r\nwere on him in their region, felt it necessary to send him onward\r\nwithout waiting for his wound to heal. He was therefore taken to the\r\nLewises, suffering very much in his removal, and arriving in a condition\r\nwhich required the most assiduous care. For more than four months he\r\nremained with them, patient and gentle in his helplessness and\r\nsuffering, and very thankful for the ministrations of kindness he\r\nreceived. He was nursed as tenderly as if his own sisters had attended\r\nhim, instead of strangers, and was so carefully concealed that the\r\nnearest neighbors knew not of his being with them. Their cousin, Morris\r\nFussell, who lived near, being a physician, they had not to depend for\r\neven medical advice upon the outside world.\r\n\r\nAs the sufferer's wound, in natural course, became offensive, the care\r\nof it could not but have been disagreeable as well as toilsome; and the\r\nfeeble health of one of the sisters at that time must have made heavier\r\nthe burden to be borne. But it was borne with a cheerful constancy. In a\r\nletter which Grace Anna wrote after she had attended for some time in\r\nperson to the patient, with the care and sympathy which his condition\r\ndemanded, and begun to feel her strength unequal to the task, in\r\naddition to her household duties, she asked a friend in Philadelphia to\r\nprocure for her a trusty colored woman fit to be a helper in the work,\r\noffering higher wages than were common in that region for the services\r\nrequired, and adding that, indeed, they could not stand upon the amount\r\nof pay, but must have help, if it could be obtained, though not in a\r\ncondition to bear undue expenditure. But, she said, the man \"is unable\r\nto be removed; and if he were not, I know of no place where the charge\r\nwould not be equally severe.\" So, in perfect keeping with her character,\r\nshe just quietly regarded it as a matter of course that it should still\r\ncontinue where it was. And there it did continue until spring, when the\r\nman, now able to bear removal, was conveyed to the writer, and, after a\r\ntime, went thence to Boston. There his foot, pronounced incurable, was\r\namputated, and the abolitionists supplied him with a wooden limb. He\r\nthen returned and spent another winter with the Lewises, assisting in\r\nthe household work, and rendering services invaluable at a time when it\r\nwas almost impossible to obtain female help. The next spring, hoping\r\nvainly to recover in a warmer climate from the disease induced by the\r\ndrain his wounded foot had made upon his system, he went to Hayti, and\r\nthere died; happy, we may well believe, to have escaped from slavery,\r\nthough only to have won scarely two years of freedom as an invalid and a\r\ncripple.\r\n\r\nThe sisters were so thoroughly united in their work, as well as in all\r\nthe experiences of life, that this brief sketch has not attempted what\r\nindeed it could not have achieved--a separation of their spheres of\r\nbeneficent activity. Yet they had each her individual traits and\r\nadaptations to their common task; \"diversities of gifts, but the same\r\nspirit.\" Elizabeth, although for many years shut out by feeble health\r\nfrom any part requiring much bodily exertion, was ever a wise\r\ncounsellor, as well as ready with such help as her state of health would\r\nwarrant. Though weak in body, in spirit she was strong and calm and\r\nself-reliant, with a clear, discriminating intellect, a keen sense of\r\nright, and a certain solidity and balanced symmetry of the spiritual\r\nnature which made her an appreciable power wherever she was known. Of\r\nMariann, Grace Anna says, that if a flash of inspiration was required,\r\nit usually came from her. Taught by her love for others, and by a\r\nsensitiveness almost preternaturally quick, \"she always knew exactly the\r\nright thing to do,\" and put all the poetry of a nature exquisitely fine\r\ninto her efforts to diffuse around her purity and peace and happiness.\r\nHer constant, utterly unselfish endeavors to this end contributed in\r\nample measure to the blessedness of a delightful home, rich in the\r\nvirtues, charities and graces which make home blessed. Veiled by her\r\nmodest and retiring disposition, to few beyond the circle of her home\r\nwere known the beauty and beneficence of her noiseless life; but those\r\nwho did look in upon it testified her worth in terms so strong as showed\r\nhow deeply it impressed them. \"Just the best woman I ever knew,\" said a\r\nyoung man for whom she had long cared like a mother. \"I cannot\r\nremember,\" said another, \"ever hearing from her one ungentle word;\" and\r\nit may be safely doubted whether she was ever heard to utter such. And\r\none who \"knew her every mood\" cannot recall an instance of selfishness\r\nin her, even when a child. \"The most womanly woman I ever knew,\"\r\ndeclared a friend long closely intimate with her, \"and such as would\r\nhave been adored, if found by any man worthy of her.\"\r\n\r\nThe ideal element in her was chastened by sound sense and blended with a\r\nquick sagacity; but her shrinking sensitiveness, too keen to be quite\r\nhealthy, and an extreme of self-forgetfulness, amounting possibly to a\r\ndefect in one sojourning amid this world's diverse dispositions and\r\nexperiences, rendered her, on the whole, less balanced and complete than\r\nher younger sisters, and not well fitted for rough encounter with life's\r\ntrials. So it became Grace Anna's province, especially after their\r\nmother's death, to stand a shelter between her and whatever would\r\nunpleasantly affect her by its contact; to be in some sort as a brother\r\nto her, seeing there was no brother in the house. But from this it must\r\nnot be inferred that Grace Anna is less gifted with the distinctive\r\nqualities of her sex. For the native fineness of her spiritual texture,\r\nher gentle dignity and feminine delicacy and grace, mark her as \"every\r\ninch\" a true and noble woman. In her combine in happy union the calm\r\nstrength of soul and self-reliance of her younger, with the poetic\r\nideality and a just degree of the quick sensibility of her elder sister,\r\nwith better health than either, making her foremost of the three in that\r\nexecutive efficiency which did so much to give their plans the uniform\r\nsuccess already mentioned. Kindness and warm affection, clearness of\r\nmoral vision, and purity of heart, with a lively relish for quiet\r\nintellectual pleasures, for society and books adapted to refine, improve\r\nand elevate, were among the characteristics common to them all.\r\n\r\nMariann and Elizabeth, having lived to see the triumph of the Right, in\r\nthe Presidential Proclamation of Freedom to the slaves, have gone from\r\ntheir earthly labors to their heavenly rest; which, we may well believe,\r\nis that whereof the poet speaks:\r\n\r\n\r\n      \"Rest in harmonious action like the stars,\r\n      Doing the deeds which make heaven musical,\r\n      The earth a heaven, and brothers of us all.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrace Anna still continues here, working for human welfare in such\r\nfields as still demand the laborer's toil; and finding mental profit and\r\ndelight in the pursuit of natural science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCUNNINGHAM'S RACHE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY MISS GRACE A. LEWIS.\r\n\r\nAmong the many fugitives whose stories were full of interest, was that\r\nof a woman named Rachel. She was tall, muscular, slight, with an\r\nextremely sensitive nervous organization, a brain of large size, and an\r\nexpression of remarkable sagacity and quickness. She was living in West\r\nChester, Chester county, Pa., when attempts were made to retake her to\r\nSlavery. With wonderful swiftness and adroitness she eluded pursuit, and\r\nwas soon hurried away. Speedily reaching our house, she hid herself away\r\nduring the day, and in the evening, as a place of greater safety, she\r\nwas transferred to the house of our uncle, Dr. Fussell, then residing on\r\nan adjoining farm. As was his wont, this kind-hearted man soon entered\r\ninto a conversation with her, and in a few minutes discovered that she\r\nhad once been a pupil of his during his residence in Maryland many years\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of recognition she sprang up, overwhelming him with her\r\nmanifestations of delight, crying: \"You Dr. Fussell? You Dr. Fussell?\r\nDon't you remember me? I'm Rache--Cunningham's Rache, down at Bush River\r\nNeck.\" Then receding to view him better, \"Lord bless de child! how he is\r\ngrown!\"\r\n\r\nHer tongue once loosened, she poured forth her whole history, expressing\r\nin every lineament her concentrated abhorrence of her libertine master,\r\n\"Mort Cunningham.\" Over that story, it is needful to pass lightly,\r\nsimply saying, she endured all outraged nature could endure and survive.\r\nFor the sake of humanity we may trust there were few such fiends even\r\namong southern masters as this monster in human shape. Cunningham\r\nfinally sold her to go further South, with a master whose name cannot\r\nnow be recalled. This man was in ill health, and after a time he and his\r\nwife started northward, bringing Rache with them. On the voyage the\r\nmaster grew worse, and one night when he was about to die, a fearful\r\nstorm arose, which Rache devoutly believed was sent from Heaven. In\r\ndescribing this scene, she impersonated her surroundings with wonderful\r\nvividness and marvellous power. At one moment she was the howling wind;\r\nat another the tumultuous sea--then the lurching ship--the bellowing cow\r\nfrightened by the storm--the devil, who came to carry away her master's\r\nsoul, and finally the weak, dying man, as he passed to eternity.\r\n\r\nThey proceeded on their voyage and landed at their place of destination.\r\nRache sees the cow snuffing the land breeze and darting off through the\r\ncrowd. The captain of the vessel points to the cow and motions her to\r\nfollow its example. She needs nothing more. Again she is acting--she is\r\nnow the cow; but human caution, shrewdness, purpose, are lent to animal\r\ninstinct. She looks around her with wary eye--scents the air--a flash,\r\nand she is hidden from the crowd which you see around her--she is free!\r\nMaking her way northward, she finally arrived at the house of Emmer\r\nKimber, Kimberton, Chester county, Pa., and proving a remarkably capable\r\nwoman, she remained a considerable time in his family, as a cook. She\r\nfinally married, and settled in West Chester, where the pair prospered\r\nand were soon surrounded by the comforts of a neat home. After several\r\nyears of peaceful life there, she was one day alarmed, not by the heirs\r\nof her dead master, but by the loathed \"Mort Cunningham,\" who, without\r\nthe shadow of legal right, had come to carry her back to Slavery. Fear\r\nlent her wings. She darted into a hatter's shop and out through the back\r\nbuildings, springing over a dye kettle in her way, and cleared a board\r\nfence at a bound. On her way to a place of safety she looked back to\r\nsee, with keen enjoyment, \"Mort Cunningham\" falling backward from the\r\nfence she had leaped. Secure in a garret, she looked down into the\r\nstreets below, to see his vacant, dazed look as he sought, unable to\r\nfind her. Her rendering of the expression of his face at this time, was\r\nirresistibly ludicrous, as was that of his whole bearing while searching\r\nfor her. \"Mort Cunningham\" did not get her, but whether or not she ever\r\nreturned to the enjoyment of her happy home, in West Chester, we never\r\nknew, as this sudden flight was the last we ever heard of her. She was\r\none of the most wide-awake of human beings, and the world certainly lost\r\nin the uneducated slave, an actor of great dramatic power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCES ELLEN WATKINS HARPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe narratives and labors of eminent colored men such as Banneker,\r\nDouglass, Brown, Garnet, and others, have been written and sketched very\r\nfully for the public, and doubtless with advantage to the cause of\r\nfreedom. But there is not to be found in any written work portraying the\r\nAnti-Slavery struggle, (except in the form of narratives,) as we are\r\naware of, a sketch of the labors of any eminent colored woman. We feel,\r\ntherefore, not only glad of the opportunity to present a sketch not\r\nmerely of the leading colored poet in the United States, but also of one\r\nof the most liberal contributors, as well as one of the ablest advocates\r\nof the Underground Rail Road and of the slave.\r\n\r\nNo extravagant praise of any kind,--only simple facts are needed to\r\nportray the noble deeds of this faithful worker.\r\n\r\nThe want of space forbids more than a brief reference to her early life.\r\n\r\nFrances Ellen Watkins Harper (Watkins being her maiden name) was born in\r\nthe City of Baltimore in 1825, not of slave parentage, but subjected of\r\ncourse to the oppressive influence which bond and free alike endured\r\nunder slave laws. Since reaching her majority, in looking back, the\r\nfollowing sentences from her own pen express the loneliness of her\r\nchildhood days. \"Have I yearned for a mother's love? The grave was my\r\nrobber. Before three years had scattered their blight around my path,\r\ndeath had won my mother from me. Would the strong arm of a brother have\r\nbeen welcome? I was my mother's only child.\" Thus she fell into the\r\nhands of an aunt, who watched over her during these early helpless\r\nyears. Rev. William Watkins, an uncle, taught a school in Baltimore for\r\nfree colored children, to which she was sent until she was about\r\nthirteen years of age. After this period, she was put out to work to\r\nearn her own living. She had many trials to endure which she would fain\r\nforget; but in the midst of them all she had an ardent thirst for\r\nknowledge and a remarkable talent for composition, as she evinced at the\r\nage of fourteen in an article which attracted the attention of the lady\r\nin whose family she was employed, and others. In this situation she was\r\ntaught sewing, took care of the children, &c.; and at the same time,\r\nthrough the kindness of her employer, her greed for books was satisfied\r\nso far as was possible from occasional half-hours of leisure. She was\r\nnoted for her industry, rarely trifling away time as most girls are wont\r\nto do in similar circumstances. Scarcely had she reached her majority\r\nere she had written a number of prose and poetic pieces which were\r\ndeemed of sufficient merit to publish in a small volume called \"Forest\r\nLeaves.\" Some of her productions found their way into newspapers and\r\nattracted attention. The ability exhibited in some of her productions\r\nwas so remarkable that some doubted and others denied their originality.\r\nOf this character we here copy an extract from one of her early prose\r\nproductions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTIANITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Christianity is a system claiming God for its author, and the\r\n    welfare of man for its object. It is a system so uniform,\r\n    exalted and pure, that the loftiest intellects have acknowledged\r\n    its influence, and acquiesced in the justness of its claims.\r\n    Genius has bent from his erratic course to gather fire from her\r\n    altars, and pathos from the agony of Gethsemane and the\r\n    sufferings of Calvary. Philosophy and science have paused amid\r\n    their speculative researches and wondrous revelations to gain\r\n    wisdom from her teachings and knowledge from her precepts.\r\n    Poetry has culled her fairest flowers and wreathed her softest\r\n    to bind her Author's 'bleeding brow.' Music has strung her\r\n    sweetest lyres and breathed her noblest strains to celebrate his\r\n    fame; whilst Learning has bent from her lofty heights to bow at\r\n    the lowly cross. The constant friend of man, she has stood by\r\n    him in his hour of greatest need. She has cheered the prisoner\r\n    in his cell, and strengthened the martyr at the stake. She has\r\n    nerved the frail and shrinking heart of woman for high and holy\r\n    deeds. The worn and weary have rested their fainting heads upon\r\n    her bosom, and gathered strength from her words and courage from\r\n    her counsels. She has been the staff of decrepit age and the joy\r\n    of manhood in its strength. She has bent over the form of lovely\r\n    childhood, and suffered it to have a place in the Redeemer's\r\n    arms. She has stood by the bed of the dying, and unveiled the\r\n    glories of eternal life, gilding the darkness of the tomb with\r\n    the glory of the resurrection.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHer mind being of a strictly religious caste, the effusions from her pen\r\nall savor of a highly moral and elevating tone.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1851 she left Baltimore to seek a home in a Free State,\r\nand for a short time resided in Ohio, where she was engaged in teaching.\r\nContrary to her expectations, her adopted home and calling not proving\r\nsatisfactory, she left that State and came to Pennsylvania as a last\r\nresort, and again engaged in teaching at Little York. Here she not only\r\nhad to encounter the trouble of dealing with unruly children, she was\r\nsorely oppressed with the thought of the condition of her people in\r\nMaryland. Not unfrequently she gave utterance to such expressions as the\r\nfollowing: \"Not that we have not a right to breathe the air as freely as\r\nanybody else here (in Baltimore), but we are treated worse than aliens\r\namong a people whose language we speak, whose religion we profess, and\r\nwhose blood flows and mingles in our veins.... Homeless in the land of\r\nour birth and worse off than strangers in the home of our nativity.\"\r\nDuring her stay in York she had frequent opportunities of seeing\r\npassengers on the Underground Rail Road. In one of her letters she thus\r\nalluded to a traveler: \"I saw a passenger _per_ the Underground Rail\r\nRoad yesterday; did he arrive safely? Notwithstanding that abomination\r\nof the nineteenth century--the Fugitive Slave Law--men still determine\r\nto be free. Notwithstanding all the darkness in which they keep the\r\nslaves, it seems that somehow light is dawning upon their minds....\r\nThese poor fugitives are a property that can walk. Just to think that\r\nfrom the rainbow-crowned Niagara to the swollen waters of the Mexican\r\nGulf, from the restless murmur of the Atlantic to the ceaseless roar of\r\nthe Pacific, the poor, half-starved, flying fugitive has no\r\nresting-place for the sole of his foot!\"\r\n\r\nWhilst hesitating whether or not it would be best to continue teaching,\r\nshe wrote to a friend for advice as follows: \"What would you do if you\r\nwere in my place? Would you give up and go back and work at your trade\r\n(dress-making)? There are no people that need all the benefits resulting\r\nfrom a well-directed education more than we do. The condition of our\r\npeople, the wants of our children, and the welfare of our race demand\r\nthe aid of every helping hand, the God-speed of every Christian heart.\r\nIt is a work of time, a labor of patience, to become an effective school\r\nteacher; and it should be a work of love in which they who engage should\r\nnot abate heart or hope until it is done. And after all, it is one of\r\nwoman's most sacred rights to have the privilege of forming the symmetry\r\nand rightly adjusting the mental balance of an immortal mind.\" \"I have\r\nwritten a lecture on education, and I am also writing a small book.\"\r\n\r\nThus, whilst filling her vocation as a teacher in Little York, was she\r\ndeeply engrossed in thought as to how she could best promote the welfare\r\nof her race. But as she was devoted to the work in hand, she soon found\r\nthat fifty-three untrained little urchins overtaxed her naturally\r\ndelicate physical powers; it also happened just about this time that she\r\nwas further moved to enter the Anti-Slavery field as a lecturer\r\nsubstantially by the following circumstance: About the year 1853,\r\nMaryland, her native State, had enacted a law forbidding free people of\r\ncolor from the North from coming into the State on pain of being\r\nimprisoned and sold into slavery. A free man, who had unwittingly\r\nviolated this infamous statute, had recently been sold to Georgia, and\r\nhad escaped thence by secreting himself behind the wheel-house of a boat\r\nbound northward; but before he reached the desired haven, he was\r\ndiscovered and remanded to slavery. It was reported that he died soon\r\nafter from the effects of exposure and suffering. In a letter to a\r\nfriend referring to this outrage, Mrs. Harper thus wrote: \"Upon that\r\ngrave I pledged myself to the Anti-Slavery cause.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus decided, she wrote in a subsequent letter, \"It may be that\r\nGod himself has written upon both my heart and brain a commission to use\r\ntime, talent and energy in the cause of freedom.\" In this abiding faith\r\nshe came to Philadelphia, hoping that the way would open for usefulness,\r\nand to publish her little book (above referred to). She visited the\r\nAnti-Slavery Office and read Anti-Slavery documents with great avidity;\r\nin the mean time making her home at the station of the Underground Rail\r\nRoad, where she frequently saw passengers and heard their melting tales\r\nof suffering and wrong, which intensely increased her sympathy in their\r\nbehalf. Although anxious to enter the Anti-Slavery field as a worker,\r\nher modesty prevented her from pressing her claims; consequently as she\r\nwas but little known, being a young and homeless maiden (an exile by\r\nlaw), no especial encouragement was tendered her by Anti-Slavery friends\r\nin Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nDuring her stay in Philadelphia she published some verses entitled,\r\n\"Eliza Harris crossing the River on the Ice.\" It was deemed best to\r\ndelay the issuing of the book.\r\n\r\nAfter spending some weeks in Philadelphia, she concluded to visit\r\nBoston. Here she was treated with the kindness characteristic of the\r\nfriends in the Anti-Slavery Office whom she visited, but only made a\r\nbrief stay, after which she proceeded to New Bedford, the \"hot-bed of\r\nthe fugitives\" in Massachusetts, where by invitation she addressed a\r\npublic meeting on the subject of Education and the Elevation of the\r\nColored Race.\r\n\r\nThe occasion and result of the commencement of her public career was\r\nthus given by her own pen in a letter dated August, 1854:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Well, I am out lecturing. I have lectured every night this\r\n    week; besides addressed a Sunday-school, and I shall speak, if\r\n    nothing prevent, to-night. My lectures have met with success.\r\n    Last night I lectured in a white church in Providence. Mr.\r\n    Gardener was present, and made the estimate of about six hundred\r\n    persons. Never, perhaps, was a speaker, old or young, favored\r\n    with a more attentive audience.... My voice is not wanting in\r\n    strength, as I am aware of, to reach pretty well over the house.\r\n    The church was the Roger Williams; the pastor, a Mr. Furnell,\r\n    who appeared to be a kind and Christian man.... My maiden\r\n    lecture was Monday night in New Bedford on the Elevation and\r\n    Education of our People. Perhaps as intellectual a place as any\r\n    I was ever at of its size.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus won her way to a favorable position as a lecturer, the\r\nfollowing month she was engaged by the State Anti-Slavery Society of\r\nMaine, with what success appears from one of her letters bearing\r\ndate--Buckstown Centre, Sept. 28, 1854:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The agent of the State Anti-Slavery Society of Maine travels\r\n    with me, and she is a pleasant, dear, sweet lady. I do like her\r\n    so. We travel together, eat together, and sleep together. (She\r\n    is a white woman.) In fact I have not been in one colored\r\n    person's house since I left Massachusetts; but I have a pleasant\r\n    time. My life reminds me of a beautiful dream. What a difference\r\n    between this and York!... I have met with some of the kindest\r\n    treatment up here that I have ever received.... I have lectured\r\n    three times this week. After I went from Limerick, I went to\r\n    Springvale; there I spoke on Sunday night at an Anti-Slavery\r\n    meeting. Some of the people are Anti-Slavery, Anti-rum and\r\n    Anti-Catholic; and if you could see our Maine ladies,--some of\r\n    them among the noblest types of womanhood you have ever seen!\r\n    They are for putting men of Anti-Slavery principles in office,\r\n    ... to cleanse the corrupt fountains of our government by\r\n    sending men to Congress who will plead for our down-trodden and\r\n    oppressed brethren, our crushed and helpless sisters, whose\r\n    tears and blood bedew our soil, whose chains are clanking 'neath\r\n    our proudest banners, whose cries and groans amid our loudest\r\n    paeans rise.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEverywhere in this latitude doors opened before her, and her gifts were\r\nuniversally recognized as a valuable acquisition to the cause. In the\r\nletter above referred to she said: \"I spoke in Boston on Monday\r\nnight.... Well, I am but one, but can do something, and, God helping me,\r\nI will try. Mr. Brister from Lowell addressed the meeting; also Rev.\r\n---- Howe. We had a good demonstration.\"\r\n\r\nHaving read the narrative of Solomon Northrup (12 years a slave), she\r\nwas led to embrace the Free Labor doctrine most thoroughly; and in a\r\nletter dated at Temple, Maine, Oct. 20, 1854, after expressing the\r\ninterest she took in the annual meeting of the Anti-Slavery Society of\r\nthat state, she remarked:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I spoke on Free Produce, and now by the way I believe in that\r\n    kind of Abolition. Oh, it does seem to strike at one of the\r\n    principal roots of the matter. I have commenced since I read\r\n    Solomon Northrup. Oh, if Mrs. Stowe has clothed American slavery\r\n    in the graceful garb of fiction, Solomon Northrup comes up from\r\n    the dark habitation of Southern cruelty where slavery fattens\r\n    and feasts on human blood with such mournful revelations that\r\n    one might almost wish for the sake of humanity that the tales of\r\n    horror which he reveals were not so. Oh, how can we pamper our\r\n    appetites upon luxuries drawn from reluctant fingers? Oh, could\r\n    slavery exist long if it did not sit on a commercial throne? I\r\n    have read somewhere, if I remember aright, of a Hindoo being\r\n    loth to cut a tree because being a believer in the\r\n    transmigration of souls, he thought the soul of his father had\r\n    passed into it ... Oh, friend, beneath the most delicate\r\n    preparations of the cane can you not see the stinging lash and\r\n    clotted whip? I have reason to be thankful that I am able to\r\n    give a little more for a Free Labor dress, if it is coarser. I\r\n    can thank God that upon its warp and woof I see no stain of\r\n    blood and tears; that to procure a little finer muslin for my\r\n    limbs no crushed and broken heart went out in sighs, and that\r\n    from the field where it was raised went up no wild and startling\r\n    cry unto the throne of God to witness there in language deep and\r\n    strong, that in demanding that cotton I was nerving oppression's\r\n    hand for deeds of guilt and crime. If the liberation of the\r\n    slave demanded it, I could consent to part with a portion of the\r\n    blood from my own veins if that would do him any good.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter having thus alluded to free labor, she gave a short journal of the\r\ndifferent places where she had recently lectured from the 5th of\r\nSeptember to the 20th of October, which we mention here simply to show\r\nthe perseverance which characterized her as an advocate of her enslaved\r\nrace, and at the same time show how doors everywhere opened to her:\r\nPortland, Monmouth Centre, North Berwick, Limerick (two meetings),\r\nSpringvale, Portsmouth, Elliott, Waterborough (spoke four times), Lyman,\r\nSaccarappo, Moderation, Steep Falls (twice), North Buxton, Goram,\r\nGardner, Litchfield, twice, Monmouth Ridge twice, Monmouth Centre three\r\ntimes, Litchfield second time, West Waterville twice, Livermore Temple.\r\nHer ability and labors were everywhere appreciated, and her meetings\r\nlargely attended. In a subsequent letter referring to the manner that\r\nshe was received, she wrote, \"A short while ago when I was down this way\r\nI took breakfast with the then Governor of Maine.\"\r\n\r\nFor a year and a half she continued in the Eastern States, speaking in\r\nmost or all of them with marked success; the papers meting out to her\r\nfull commendation for her efforts. The following extract clipped from\r\nthe Portland Daily Press, respecting a lecture that she was invited to\r\ndeliver after the war by the Mayor (Mr. Washburne) and others, is a fair\r\nsample of notices from this source:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"She spoke for nearly an hour and a half, her subject being 'The\r\n    Mission of the War, and the Demands of the Colored Race in the\r\n    Work of Reconstruction;' and we have seldom seen an audience\r\n    more attentive, better pleased, or more enthusiastic. Mrs.\r\n    Harper has a splendid articulation, uses chaste, pure language,\r\n    has a pleasant voice, and allows no one to tire of hearing her.\r\n    We shall attempt no abstract of her address; none that we could\r\n    make would do her justice. It was one of which any lecturer\r\n    might feel proud, and her reception by a Portland audience was\r\n    all that could be desired. We have seen no praises of her that\r\n    were overdrawn. We have heard Miss Dickinson, and do not\r\n    hesitate to award the palm to her darker colored sister.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1856, desiring to see the fugitives in Canada, she visited the Upper\r\nProvince, and in a letter dated at Niagara Falls, Sept. 12th, she\r\nunfolded her mind in the following language:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Well, I have gazed for the first time upon Free Land, and,\r\n    would you believe it, tears sprang to my eyes, and I wept. Oh,\r\n    it was a glorious sight to gaze for the first time on a land\r\n    where a poor slave flying from our glorious land of liberty\r\n    would in a moment find his fetters broken, his shackles loosed,\r\n    and whatever he was in the land of Washington, beneath the\r\n    shadow of Bunker Hill Monument or even Plymouth Rock, here he\r\n    becomes a man and a brother. I have gazed on Harper's Ferry, or\r\n    rather the rock at the Ferry; I have seen it towering up in\r\n    simple grandeur, with the gentle Potomac gliding peacefully at\r\n    its feet, and felt that that was God's masonry, and my soul had\r\n    expanded in gazing on its sublimity. I have seen the ocean\r\n    singing its wild chorus of sounding waves, and ecstacy has\r\n    thrilled upon the living chords of my heart. I have since then\r\n    seen the rainbow-crowned Niagara chanting the choral hymn of\r\n    Omnipotence, girdled with grandeur, and robed with glory; but\r\n    none of these things have melted me as the first sight of Free\r\n    Land. Towering mountains lifting their hoary summits to catch\r\n    the first faint flush of day when the sunbeams kiss the shadows\r\n    from morning's drowsy face may expand and exalt your soul. The\r\n    first view of the ocean may fill you with strange delight.\r\n    Niagara--the great, the glorious Niagara--may hush your spirit\r\n    with its ceaseless thunder; it may charm you with its robe of\r\n    crested spray and rainbow crown; but the land of Freedom was a\r\n    lesson of deeper significance than foaming waves or towering\r\n    mounts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile in Toronto she lectured, and was listened to with great interest;\r\nbut she made only a brief visit, thence returning to Philadelphia, her\r\nadopted home.\r\n\r\nWith her newly acquired reputation as a lecturer, from 1856 to 1859 she\r\ncontinued her labors in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, &c. In\r\nthe meantime she often came in contact with Underground Rail Road\r\npassengers, especially in Philadelphia. None sympathized with them more\r\nsincerely or showed a greater willingness to render them material aid.\r\nShe contributed apparently with the same liberality as though they were\r\nher own near kin. Even when at a distance, so deep was her interest in\r\nthe success of the Road, she frequently made it her business to forward\r\ndonations, and carefully inquire into the state of the treasury. The\r\nChairman of the Committee might publish a volume of interesting letters\r\nfrom her pen relating to the Underground Rail Road and kindred topics;\r\nbut a few extracts must suffice. We here copy from a letter dated at\r\nRushsylvania, Ohio, Dec. 15th: \"I send you to-day two dollars for the\r\nUnderground Rail Road. It is only a part of what I subscribed at your\r\nmeeting. May God speed the flight of the slave as he speeds through our\r\nRepublic to gain his liberty in a monarchical land. I am still in the\r\nlecturing field, though not very strong physically.... Send me word what\r\nI can do for the fugitive.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Tiffin, Ohio, March 31st, touching the news of a rescue in\r\nPhiladelphia, she thus wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I see by the Cincinnati papers that you have had an attempted\r\n    rescue and a failure. That is sad! Can you not give me the\r\n    particulars? and if there is anything that I can do for them in\r\n    money or words, call upon me. This is a common cause; and if\r\n    there is any burden to be borne in the\r\n    Anti-Slavery-cause--anything to be done to weaken our hateful\r\n    chains or assert our manhood and womanhood, I have a right to do\r\n    my share of the work. The humblest and feeblest of us can do\r\n    something; and though I may be deficient in many of the\r\n    conventionalisms of city life, and be considered as a person of\r\n    good impulses, but unfinished, yet if there is common rough work\r\n    to be done, call on me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Harper was not content to make speeches and receive plaudits, but\r\nwas ever willing to do the rough work and to give material aid wherever\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nFrom another letter dated Lewis Centre, Ohio, we copy the following\r\ncharacteristic extract:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Yesterday I sent you thirty dollars. Take five of it for the\r\n    rescuers (who were in prison), and the rest pay away on the\r\n    books. My offering is not large; but if you need more, send me\r\n    word. Also how comes on the Underground Rail Road? Do you need\r\n    anything for that? You have probably heard of the shameful\r\n    outrage of a colored man or boy named Wagner, who was kidnapped\r\n    in Ohio and carried across the river and sold for a slave....\r\n    Ohio has become a kind of a negro hunting ground, a new Congo's\r\n    coast and Guinea's shore. A man was kidnapped almost under the\r\n    shadow of our capital. Oh, was it not dreadful?... Oh, may the\r\n    living God prepare me for an earnest and faithful advocacy of\r\n    the cause of justice and right!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn those days the blows struck by the hero, John Brown, were agitating\r\nthe nation. Scarcely was it possible for a living soul to be more deeply\r\naffected than this female advocate. Nor did her sympathies end in mere\r\nwords. She tendered material aid as well as heartfelt commiseration.\r\n\r\nTo John Brown's wife[A] she sent through the writer the following\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Mrs. Harper passed two weeks with Mrs. Brown at the house\r\nof the writer while she was awaiting the execution of her husband, and\r\nsympathized with her most deeply.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER TO JOHN BROWN'S WIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    FARMER CENTRE, OHIO, Nov. 14th.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MADAM:--In an hour like this the common words of\r\n    sympathy may seem like idle words, and yet I want to say\r\n    something to you, the noble wife of the hero of the nineteenth\r\n    century. Belonging to the race your dear husband reached forth\r\n    his hand to assist, I need not tell you that my sympathies are\r\n    with you. I thank you for the brave words you have spoken. A\r\n    republic that produces such a wife and mother may hope for\r\n    better days. Our heart may grow more hopeful for humanity when\r\n    it sees the sublime sacrifice it is about to receive from his\r\n    hands. Not in vain has your dear husband periled all, if the\r\n    martyrdom of one hero is worth more than the life of a million\r\n    cowards. From the prison comes forth a shout of triumph over\r\n    that power whose ethics are robbery of the feeble and oppression\r\n    of the weak, the trophies of whose chivalry are a plundered\r\n    cradle and a scourged and bleeding woman. Dear sister, I thank\r\n    you for the brave and noble words that you have spoken. Enclosed\r\n    I send you a few dollars as a token of my gratitude, reverence\r\n    and love.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n\r\n    FRANCES ELLEN WATKINS.\r\n\r\n    Post Office address: care of William Still, 107 Fifth St.,\r\n    Philadelphia, Penn.\r\n\r\n    May God, our own God, sustain you in the hour of trial. If there\r\n    is one thing on earth I can do for you or yours, let me be\r\n    apprized. I am at your service.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot forgetting Brown's comrades, who were then lying in prison under\r\nsentence of death, true to the best impulses of her generous heart, she\r\nthus wrote relative to these ill-fated prisoners, from Montpelier, Dec.\r\n12th:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I thank you for complying with my request. (She had previously\r\n    ordered a box of things to be forwarded to them.) And also that\r\n    you wrote to them. You see Brown towered up so bravely that\r\n    these doomed and fated men may have been almost overlooked, and\r\n    just think that I am able to send one ray through the night\r\n    around them. And as their letters came too late to answer in\r\n    time, I am better satisfied that you wrote. I hope the things\r\n    will reach them. Poor doomed and fated men! Why did you not send\r\n    them more things? Please send me the bill of expense.... Send me\r\n    word what I can do for the fugitives. Do you need any money? Do\r\n    I not owe you on the old bill (pledge)? Look carefully and see\r\n    if I have paid all. Along with this letter I send you one for\r\n    Mr. Stephens (one of Brown's men), and would ask you to send him\r\n    a box of nice things every week till he dies or is acquitted. I\r\n    understand the balls have not been extracted from him. Has not\r\n    this suffering been overshadowed by the glory that gathered\r\n    around the brave old man?... Spare no expense to make the last\r\n    hours of his (Stephens') life as bright as possible with\r\n    sympathy.... Now, my friend, fulfil this to the letter. Oh, is\r\n    it not a privilege, if you are sisterless and lonely, to be a\r\n    sister to the human race, and to place your heart where it may\r\n    throb close to down-trodden humanity?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn another occasion in writing from the lecturing field hundreds of\r\nmiles away from Philadelphia, the sympathy she felt for the fugitives\r\nfound expression in the following language:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"How fared the girl who came robed in male attire? Do write me\r\n    every time you write how many come to your house; and, my dear\r\n    friend, if you have that much in hand of mine from my books,\r\n    will you please pay the Vigilance Committee two or three dollars\r\n    for me to help carry on the glorious enterprise. Now, please do\r\n    not write back that you are not going to do any such thing. Let\r\n    me explain a few matters to you. In the first place, I am able\r\n    to give something. In the second place, I am willing to do\r\n    so.... Oh, life is fading away, and we have but an hour of time!\r\n    Should we not, therefore, endeavor to let its history gladden\r\n    the earth? The nearer we ally ourselves to the wants and woes of\r\n    humanity in the spirit of Christ, the closer we get to the great\r\n    heart of God; the nearer we stand by the beating of the pulse of\r\n    universal love.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDoubtless it has not often been found necessary for persons desirous of\r\ncontributing to benevolent causes to first have to remove anticipated\r\nobjections. Nevertheless in some cases it would seem necessary to\r\nadmonish her not to be quite so liberal; to husband with a little more\r\ncare her hard-earned income for a \"rainy day,\" as her health was not\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\n\"My health,\" she wrote at that time, \"is not very strong, and I may have\r\nto give up before long. I may have to yield on account of my voice,\r\nwhich I think, has become somewhat affected. I might be so glad if it\r\nwas only so that I could go home among my own kindred and people, but\r\nslavery comes up like a dark shadow between me and the home of my\r\nchildhood. Well, perhaps it is my lot to die from home and be buried\r\namong strangers; and yet I do not regret that I have espoused this\r\ncause; perhaps I have been of some service to the cause of human rights,\r\nand I hope the consciousness that I have not lived in vain, will be a\r\nhalo of peace around my dying bed; a heavenly sunshine lighting up the\r\ndark valley and shadow of death.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this yearning for home, she was far from desiring at her\r\ndeath, a burial in a Slave State, as the following clearly expressed\r\nviews show:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I have lived in the midst of oppression and wrong, and I am\r\n    saddened by every captured fugitive in the North; a blow has\r\n    been struck at my freedom, in every hunted and down-trodden\r\n    slave in the South; North and South have both been guilty, and\r\n    they that sin must suffer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, in harmony with the above sentiments, came a number of verses\r\nappropriate to her desires in this respect, one of which we here give as\r\na sample:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Make me a grave where'er you will,\r\n  In a lowly plain, or a lofty hill,\r\n  Make it among earth's humblest graves,\r\n  But not in a land where men are slaves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the State of Maine the papers brought to her notice the capture of\r\nMargaret Garner, and the tragic and bloody deed connected therewith. And\r\nshe writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Rome had her altars where the trembling criminal, and the worn\r\n    and weary slave might fly for an asylum--Judea her cities of\r\n    refuge; but Ohio, with her Bibles and churches, her baptisms and\r\n    prayers, had not one temple so dedicated to human rights, one\r\n    altar so consecrated to human liberty, that trampled upon and\r\n    down-trodden innocence knew that it could find protection for a\r\n    night, or shelter for a day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1860, in the city of Cincinnati, Mrs. Harper was married\r\nto Fenton Harper, a widower, and resident of Ohio. It seemed obvious\r\nthat this change would necessarily take her from the sphere of her\r\nformer usefulness. The means she had saved from the sale of her books\r\nand from her lectures, she invested in a small farm near Columbus, and\r\nin a short time after her marriage she entered upon house-keeping.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding her family cares, consequent upon married life, she only\r\nceased from her literary and anti-slavery labors, when compelled to do\r\nso by other duties.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of May, 1864, death deprived her of her husband.\r\n\r\nWhilst she could not give so much attention to writing as she could have\r\ndesired in her household days, she, nevertheless, did then produce some\r\nof her best productions. Take the following for a sample, on the return\r\nfrom Cleveland, Ohio, of a poor, ill-fated slave-girl, (under the\r\nFugitive Slave Law):\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE UNION SAVERS OF CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Men of Cleveland, had a vulture\r\n    Sought a timid dove for prey,\r\n  Would you not, with human pity,\r\n    Drive the gory bird away?\r\n\r\n\r\n  Had you seen a feeble lambkin,\r\n    Shrinking from a wolf so bold,\r\n  Would ye not to shield the trembler,\r\n    In your arms have made its fold?\r\n\r\n\r\n  But when she, a hunted sister,\r\n    Stretched her hands that ye might save,\r\n  Colder far than Zembla's regions\r\n    Was the answer that ye gave.\r\n\r\n\r\n  On the Union's bloody altar,\r\n    Was your hapless victim laid;\r\n  Mercy, truth and justice shuddered,\r\n    But your hands would give no aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n  And ye sent her back to torture,\r\n    Robbed of freedom and of right.\r\n  Thrust the wretched, captive stranger.\r\n    Back to slavery's gloomy night.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Back where brutal men may trample,\r\n    On her honor and her fame;\r\n  And unto her lips so dusky,\r\n    Press the cup of woe and shame.\r\n\r\n\r\n  There is blood upon your city,\r\n    Dark and dismal is the stain;\r\n  And your hands would fail to cleanse it,\r\n    Though Lake Erie ye should drain.\r\n\r\n\r\n  There's a curse upon your Union,\r\n    Fearful sounds are in the air;\r\n  As if thunderbolts were framing,\r\n    Answers to the bondsman's prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ye may offer human victims,\r\n    Like the heathen priests of old;\r\n  And may barter manly honor\r\n    For the Union and for gold.\r\n\r\n\r\n  But ye can not stay the whirlwind,\r\n    When the storm begins to break;\r\n  And our God doth rise in judgment,\r\n    For the poor and needy's sake.\r\n\r\n\r\n  And, your sin-cursed, guilty Union,\r\n    Shall be shaken to its base,\r\n  Till ye learn that simple justice,\r\n    Is the right of every race.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Harper took the deepest interest in the war, and looked with\r\nextreme anxiety for the results; and she never lost an opportunity to\r\nwrite, speak, or serve the cause in any way that she thought would best\r\npromote the freedom of the slave. On the proclamation of General\r\nFremont, the passages from her pen are worthy to be long remembered:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Well, what think you of the war? To me one of the most\r\n    interesting features is Fremont's Proclamation freeing the\r\n    slaves of the rebels. Is there no ray of hope in that? I should\r\n    not wonder if Edward M. Davis breathed that into his ear. His\r\n    proclamation looks like real earnestness; no mincing the matter\r\n    with the rebels. Death to the traitors and confiscation of their\r\n    slaves is no child's play. I hope that the boldness of his stand\r\n    will inspire others to look the real cause of the war in the\r\n    face and inspire the government with uncompromising earnestness\r\n    to remove the festering curse. And yet I am not uneasy about the\r\n    result of this war. We may look upon it as God's controversy\r\n    with the nation; His arising to plead by fire and blood the\r\n    cause of His poor and needy people. Some time since\r\n    Breckinridge, in writing to Sumner, asks, if I rightly remember,\r\n    What is the fate of a few negroes to me or mine? Bound up in one\r\n    great bundle of humanity our fates seem linked together, our\r\n    destiny entwined with theirs, and our rights are interwoven\r\n    together.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally when the long-looked-for Emancipation Proclamation came,\r\nalthough Mrs. Harper was not at that time very well, she accepted an\r\ninvitation to address a public meeting in Columbus, Ohio, an allusion to\r\nwhich we find in a letter dated at Grove City, O., which we copy with\r\nthe feeling that many who may read this volume will sympathize with\r\nevery word uttered relative to the Proclamation:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I spoke in Columbus on the President's Proclamation.... But was\r\n    not such an event worthy the awakening of every power--the\r\n    congratulation of every faculty? What hath God wrought! We may\r\n    well exclaim how event after event has paved the way for\r\n    freedom. In the crucible of disaster and defeat God has stirred\r\n    the nation, and permitted no permanent victory to crown her\r\n    banners while she kept her hand upon the trembling slave and\r\n    held him back from freedom. And even now the scale may still\r\n    seem to oscillate between the contending parties, and some may\r\n    say, Why does not God give us full and quick victory? My friend,\r\n    do not despair if even deeper shadows gather around the fate of\r\n    the nation, that truth will not ultimately triumph, and the\r\n    right be established and vindicated; but the deadly gangrene has\r\n    taken such deep and almost fatal hold upon the nation that the\r\n    very centres of its life seem to be involved in its eradication.\r\n    Just look, after all the trials deep and fiery through which the\r\n    nation has waded, how mournfully suggestive was the response the\r\n    proclamation received from the democratic triumphs which\r\n    followed so close upon its footsteps. Well, thank God that the\r\n    President did not fail us, that the fierce rumbling of\r\n    democratic thunder did not shake from his hand the bolt he\r\n    leveled against slavery. Oh, it would have been so sad if, after\r\n    all the desolation and carnage that have dyed our plains with\r\n    blood and crimsoned our borders with warfare, the pale young\r\n    corpses trodden down by the hoofs of war, the dim eyes that have\r\n    looked their last upon the loved and lost, had the arm of\r\n    Executive power failed us in the nation's fearful crisis! For\r\n    how mournful it is when the unrighted wrongs and fearful agonies\r\n    of ages reach their culminating point, and events solemn,\r\n    terrible and sublime marshal themselves in dread array to mould\r\n    the destiny of nations, the hands appointed to hold the helm of\r\n    affairs, instead of grasping the mighty occasions and stamping\r\n    them with the great seals of duty and right, permit them to\r\n    float along the current of circumstances without comprehending\r\n    the hour of visitation or the momentous day of opportunity. Yes,\r\n    we may thank God that in the hour when the nation's life was\r\n    convulsed, and fearful gloom had shed its shadows over the land,\r\n    the President reached out his hand through the darkness to break\r\n    the chains on which the rust of centuries had gathered. Well,\r\n    did you ever expect to see this day? I know that all is not\r\n    accomplished; but we may rejoice in what has been already\r\n    wrought,--the wondrous change in so short a time. Just a little\r\n    while since the American flag to the flying bondman was an\r\n    ensign of bondage; now it has become a symbol of protection and\r\n    freedom. Once the slave was a despised and trampled on pariah;\r\n    now he has become a useful ally to the American government. From\r\n    the crimson sods of war springs the white flower of freedom, and\r\n    songs of deliverance mingle with the crash and roar of war. The\r\n    shadow of the American army becomes a covert for the slave, and\r\n    beneath the American Eagle he grasps the key of knowledge and is\r\n    lifted to a higher destiny.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter we had intended should complete the sketch of Mrs. Harper's\r\nAnti-Slavery labors; but in turning to another epistle dated Boston,\r\nApril 19th, on the Assassination of the President, we feel that a part\r\nof it is too interesting to omit:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Sorrow treads on the footsteps of the nation's joy. A few days\r\n    since the telegraph thrilled and throbbed with a nation's joy.\r\n    To-day a nation sits down beneath the shadow of its mournful\r\n    grief. Oh, what a terrible lesson does this event read to us! A\r\n    few years since slavery tortured, burned, hung and outraged us,\r\n    and the nation passed by and said, they had nothing to do with\r\n    slavery where it was, slavery would have something to do with\r\n    them where they were. Oh, how fearfully the judgments of Ichabod\r\n    have pressed upon the nation's life! Well, it may be in the\r\n    providence of God this blow was needed to intensify the nation's\r\n    hatred of slavery, to show the utter fallacy of basing national\r\n    reconstruction upon the votes of returned rebels, and rejecting\r\n    loyal black men; making (after all the blood poured out like\r\n    water, and wealth scattered like chaff) a return to the old idea\r\n    that a white rebel is better or of more account in the body\r\n    politic than a loyal black man.... Moses, the meekest man on\r\n    earth, led the children of Israel over the Red Sea, but was not\r\n    permitted to see them settled in Canaan. Mr. Lincoln has led up\r\n    through another Red Sea to the table land of triumphant victory,\r\n    and God has seen fit to summon for the new era another man. It\r\n    is ours then to bow to the Chastener and let our honored and\r\n    loved chieftain go. Surely the everlasting arms that have hushed\r\n    him so strangely to sleep are able to guide the nation through\r\n    its untrod future; but in vain should be this fearful baptism of\r\n    blood if from the dark bosom of slavery springs such terrible\r\n    crimes. Let the whole nation resolve that the whole virus shall\r\n    be eliminated from its body; that in the future slavery shall\r\n    only be remembered as a thing of the past that shall never have\r\n    the faintest hope of a resurrection.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to this point, we have spoken of Mrs. Harper as a laborer, battling\r\nfor freedom under slavery and the war. She is equally earnest in\r\nlaboring for Equality before the law--education, and a higher manhood,\r\nespecially in the South, among the Freedmen.\r\n\r\nFor the best part of several years, since the war, she has traveled very\r\nextensively through the Southern States, going on the plantations and\r\namongst the lowly, as well as to the cities and towns, addressing\r\nschools, Churches, meetings in Court Houses, Legislative Halls, &c.,\r\nand, sometimes, under the most trying and hazardous circumstances;\r\ninfluenced in her labor of love, wholly by the noble impulses of her own\r\nheart, working her way along unsustained by any Society. In this\r\nmission, she has come in contact with all classes--the original\r\nslaveholders and the Freedmen, before and since the Fifteenth Amendment\r\nbill was enacted. Excepting two of the Southern States (Texas and\r\nArkansas), she has traveled largely over all the others, and in no\r\ninstance has she permitted herself, through fear, to disappoint an\r\naudience, when engagements had been made for her to speak, although\r\nfrequently admonished that it would be dangerous to venture in so doing.\r\n\r\nWe first quote from a letter dated Darlington, S.C., May 13, 1867:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"You will see by this that I am in the sunny South.... I here\r\n    read and see human nature under new lights and phases. I meet\r\n    with a people eager to hear, ready to listen, as if they felt\r\n    that the slumber of the ages had been broken, and that they were\r\n    to sleep no more.... I am glad that the colored man gets his\r\n    freedom and suffrage together; that he is not forced to go\r\n    through the same condition of things here, that has inclined him\r\n    so much to apathy, isolation, and indifference, in the North.\r\n    You, perhaps, wonder why I have been so slow in writing to you,\r\n    but if you knew how busy I am, just working up to or past the\r\n    limit of my strength. Traveling, conversing, addressing day and\r\n    Sunday-schools (picking up scraps of information, takes up a\r\n    large portion of my time), besides what I give to reading. For\r\n    my audiences I have both white and colored. On the cars, some\r\n    find out that I am a lecturer, and then, again, I am drawn into\r\n    conversation. 'What are you lecturing about?' the question comes\r\n    up, and if I say, among other topics politics, then I may look\r\n    for an onset. There is a sensitiveness on this subject, a dread,\r\n    it may be, that some one will 'put the devil in the nigger's\r\n    head,' or exert some influence inimical to them; still, I get\r\n    along somewhat pleasantly. Last week I had a small congregation\r\n    of listeners in the cars, where I sat. I got in conversation\r\n    with a former slave dealer, and we had rather an exciting time.\r\n    I was traveling alone, but it is not worth while to show any\r\n    signs of fear.  *  *  *Last Saturday I spoke in Sumter; a number\r\n    of white persons were present, and I had been invited to speak\r\n    there by the Mayor and editor of the paper. There had been some\r\n    violence in the district, and some of my friends did not wish me\r\n    to go, but I had promised, and, of course, I went.  *  *  *  *\r\n    I am in Darlington, and spoke yesterday, but my congregation was\r\n    so large, that I stood near the door of the church, so that I\r\n    might be heard both inside and out, for a large portion, perhaps\r\n    nearly half my congregation were on the outside; and this, in\r\n    Darlington, where, about two years ago, a girl was hung for\r\n    making a childish and indiscreet speech. Victory was perched on\r\n    our banners. Our army had been through, and this poor, ill-fated\r\n    girl, almost a child in years, about seventeen years of age,\r\n    rejoiced over the event, and said that she was going to marry a\r\n    Yankee and set up housekeeping. She was reported as having made\r\n    an incendiary speech and arrested, cruelly scourged, and then\r\n    brutally hung. Poor child! she had been a faithful servant--her\r\n    master tried to save her, but the tide of fury swept away his\r\n    efforts.  *  *  *  Oh, friend, perhaps, sometimes your heart\r\n    would ache, if you were only here and heard of the wrongs and\r\n    abuses to which these people have been subjected.  *  *  *\r\n    Things, I believe, are a little more hopeful; at least, I\r\n    believe, some of the colored people are getting better\r\n    contracts, and, I understand, that there's less murdering. While\r\n    I am writing, a colored man stands here, with a tale of\r\n    wrong--he has worked a whole year, year before last, and now he\r\n    has been put off with fifteen bushels of corn and his food;\r\n    yesterday he went to see about getting his money, and the person\r\n    to whom he went, threatened to kick him off, and accused him of\r\n    stealing. I don't know how the colored man will vote, but\r\n    perhaps many of them will be intimidated at the polls.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a letter dated Cheraw, June 17th, 1867, the following remarks are\r\ntaken:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Well, Carolina is an interesting place. There is not a state in\r\n    the Union I prefer to Carolina. Kinder, more hospitable,\r\n    warmer-hearted people perhaps you will not find anywhere. I have\r\n    been to Georgia; but Carolina is my preference.  *  *  The South\r\n    is to be a great theatre for the colored man's development and\r\n    progress. There is brain-power here. If any doubt it, let him\r\n    come into our schools, or even converse with some of our\r\n    Freedmen either in their homes or by the way-side.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days later she gave an account of a visit she had just made in\r\nFlorence, where our poor soldiers had been prisoners; saw some of the\r\nhuts where they were exposed to rain and heat and cold with only the\r\ntemporary shelter they made for themselves, which was a sad sight. Then\r\nshe visited the grave-yards of some thousands of Union soldiers. Here in\r\n\"eastern South Carolina\" she was in \"one of the worst parts of the\r\nState\" in the days of Slavery; but under the new order of things,\r\ninstead of the lash, she saw school books, and over the ruins of\r\nslavery, education and free speech springing up, at which she was moved\r\nto exclaim, \"Thank God for the wonderful change! I have lectured several\r\nnights this week, and the weather is quite warm; but I do like South\r\nCarolina. No state in the Union as far as colored people are concerned,\r\ndo I like better--the land of warm welcomes and friendly hearts. God\r\nbless her and give her great peace!\"\r\n\r\nAt a later period she visited Charleston and Columbia, and was well\r\nreceived in both places. She spoke a number of times in the different\r\nFreedmen schools and the colored churches in Charleston, once in the\r\nLegislative Hall, and also in one of the colored churches in Columbia.\r\nShe received special encouragement and kindness from Hon. H. Cadoza,\r\nSecretary of State, and his family, and regarded him as a wise and\r\nupright leader of his race in that state.\r\n\r\nThe following are some stirring lines which she wrote upon the Fifteenth\r\nAmendment:\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTEENTH AMENDMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Beneath the burden of our joy\r\n    Tremble, O wires, from East to West!\r\n  Fashion with words your tongues of fire,\r\n    To tell the nation's high behest.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Outstrip the winds, and leave behind\r\n    The murmur of the restless waves;\r\n  Nor tarry with your glorious news,\r\n    Amid the ocean's coral caves.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ring out! ring out! your sweetest chimes,\r\n    Ye bells, that call to praise;\r\n  Let every heart with gladness thrill,\r\n    And songs of joyful triumph raise.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Shake off the dust, O rising race!\r\n    Crowned as a brother and a man;\r\n  Justice to-day asserts her claim,\r\n    And from thy brow fades out the ban.\r\n\r\n\r\n  With freedom's chrism upon thy head,\r\n    Her precious ensign in thy hand,\r\n  Go place thy once despised name\r\n    Amid the noblest of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n  O ransomed race! give God the praise,\r\n    Who led thee through a crimson sea,\r\n  And 'mid the storm of fire and blood,\r\n    Turned out the war-cloud's light to thee.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Harper, in writing from Kingstree, S.C., July 11th, 1867, in\r\nmidsummer (laboring almost without any pecuniary reward), gave an\r\naccount of a fearful catastrophe which had just occurred there in the\r\nburning of the jail with a number of colored prisoners in it. \"It was a\r\nvery sad affair. There was only one white prisoner and he got out. I\r\nbelieve there was some effort made to release some of the prisoners; but\r\nthe smoke was such that the effort proved ineffectual. Well, for the\r\ncredit of our common human nature we may hope that it was so.  *  *  *\r\nLast night I had some of the 'rebs' to hear me (part of the time some of\r\nthe white folks come out). Our meetings are just as quiet and as orderly\r\non the whole in Carolina as one might desire.  *  *  I like General\r\nSickles as a Military Governor. 'Massa Daniel, he King of the\r\nCarolinas.' I like his Mastership. Under him we ride in the City Cars,\r\nand get first-class passage on the railroad.\" At this place a colored\r\nman was in prison under sentence of death for \"participating in a riot;\"\r\nand the next day (after the date of her letter) was fixed for his\r\nexecution. With some others, Mrs. Harper called at General Sickles' Head\r\nQuarters, hoping to elicit his sympathies whereby the poor fellow's life\r\nmight be saved; but he was not in. Hence they were not able to do\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n\"Next week,\" continued Mrs. Harper, \"I am to speak in a place where one\r\nof our teachers was struck and a colored man shot, who, I believe, gave\r\noffence by some words spoken at a public meeting. I do not feel any\r\nparticular fear.\"\r\n\r\nHer Philadelphia correspondent had jestingly suggested to her in one of\r\nhis letters, that she should be careful not to allow herself to be\r\n\"bought by the rebels.\" To which she replied:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Now, in reference to being bought by rebels and becoming a\r\n    Johnsonite I hold that between the white people and the colored\r\n    there is a community of interests, and the sooner they find it\r\n    out, the better it will be for both parties; but that community\r\n    of interests does not consist in increasing the privileges of\r\n    one class and curtailing the rights of the other, but in getting\r\n    every citizen interested in the welfare, progress and durability\r\n    of the state. I do not in lecturing confine myself to the\r\n    political side of the question. While I am in favor of Universal\r\n    suffrage, yet I know that the colored man needs something more\r\n    than a vote in his hand: he needs to know the value of a home\r\n    life; to rightly appreciate and value the marriage relation; to\r\n    know how and to be incited to leave behind him the old shards\r\n    and shells of slavery and to rise in the scale of character,\r\n    wealth and influence. Like the Nautilus outgrowing his home to\r\n    build for himself more 'stately temples' of social condition. A\r\n    man landless, ignorant and poor may use the vote against his\r\n    interests; but with intelligence and land he holds in his hand\r\n    the basis of power and elements of strength.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile contemplating the great demand for laborers, in a letter from\r\nAthens, February 1st, 1870, after referring to some who had been\r\n\"discouraged from the field,\" she wisely added that it was \"no time to\r\nbe discouraged.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    *  *  *  \"If those who can benefit our people will hang around\r\n    places where they are not needed, they may expect to be\r\n    discouraged.  *  *  *  Here is ignorance to be instructed; a\r\n    race who needs to be helped up to higher planes of thought and\r\n    action; and whether we are hindered or helped, we should try to\r\n    be true to the commission God has written upon our souls. As far\r\n    as the colored people are concerned, they are beginning to get\r\n    homes for themselves and depositing money in Bank. They have\r\n    hundreds of homes in Kentucky. There is progress in Tennessee,\r\n    and even in this State while a number have been leaving, some\r\n    who stay seem to be getting along prosperously. In Augusta\r\n    colored persons are in the Revenue Office and Post Office. I\r\n    have just been having some good meetings there. Some of my\r\n    meetings pay me poorly; but I have a chance to instruct and\r\n    visit among the people and talk to their Sunday-schools and\r\n    day-schools also. Of course I do not pretend that all are saving\r\n    money or getting homes. I rather think from what I hear that the\r\n    interest of the grown-up people in getting education has\r\n    somewhat subsided, owing, perhaps, in a measure, to the novelty\r\n    having worn off and the absorption or rather direction of the\r\n    mind to other matters. Still I don't think that I have visited\r\n    scarcely a place since last August where there was no desire for\r\n    a teacher; and Mr. Fidler, who is a Captain or Colonel, thought\r\n    some time since that there were more colored than white who were\r\n    learning or had learned to read. There has been quite an amount\r\n    of violence and trouble in the State; but we have the military\r\n    here, and if they can keep Georgia out of the Union about a year\r\n    or two longer, and the colored people continue to live as they\r\n    have been doing, from what I hear, perhaps these rebels will\r\n    learn a little more sense. I have been in Atlanta for some time,\r\n    but did not stay until the Legislature was organized; but I was\r\n    there when colored members returned and took their seats. It was\r\n    rather a stormy time in the House; but no blood was shed. Since\r\n    then there has been some 'sticking;' but I don't think any of\r\n    the colored ones were in it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the neighborhood of Eufaula, Ala., in December, 1870, Mrs. Harper did\r\na good work, as may be seen from the following extract taken from a\r\nletter, dated December 9th:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Last evening I visited one of the plantations, and had an\r\n    interesting time. Oh, how warm was the welcome! I went out near\r\n    dark, and between that time and attending my lecture, I was out\r\n    to supper in two homes. The people are living in the old cabins\r\n    of slavery; some of them have no windows, at all, that I see; in\r\n    fact, I don't remember of having seen a pane of window-glass in\r\n    the settlement. But, humble as their homes were, I was kindly\r\n    treated, and well received; and what a chance one has for\r\n    observation among these people, if one takes with her a manner\r\n    that unlocks other hearts. I had quite a little gathering, after\r\n    less, perhaps, than a day's notice; the minister did not know\r\n    that I was coming, till he met me in the afternoon. There was no\r\n    fire in the church, and so they lit fires outside, and we\r\n    gathered, or at least a number of us, around the fire. To-night\r\n    I am going over to Georgia to lecture. In consequence of the low\r\n    price of cotton, the people may not be able to pay much, and I\r\n    am giving all my lectures free. You speak of things looking dark\r\n    in the South; there is no trouble here that I know of--cotton is\r\n    low, but the people do not seem to be particularly depressed\r\n    about it; this emigration question has been on the carpet, and I\r\n    do not wonder if some of them, with their limited knowledge,\r\n    lose hope in seeing full justice done to them, among their\r\n    life-long oppressors; Congress has been agitating the St.\r\n    Domingo question; a legitimate theme for discussion, and one\r\n    that comes nearer home, is how they can give more security and\r\n    strength to the government which we have established in the\r\n    South--for there has been a miserable weakness in the security\r\n    to human life. The man with whom I stopped, had a son who\r\n    married a white woman, or girl, and was shot down, and there\r\n    was, as I understand, no investigation by the jury; and a number\r\n    of cases have occurred of murders, for which the punishment has\r\n    been very lax, or not at all, and, it may be, never will be;\r\n    however, I rather think things are somewhat quieter. A few days\r\n    ago a shameful outrage occurred at this place--some men had been\r\n    out fox hunting, and came to the door of a colored woman and\r\n    demanded entrance, making out they wanted fire; she replied that\r\n    she had none, and refused to open the door; the miserable\r\n    cowards broke open the door, and shamefully beat her. I am going\r\n    to see her this afternoon. It is remarkable, however, in spite\r\n    of circumstances, how some of these people are getting along.\r\n    Here is a woman who, with her husband, at the surrender, had a\r\n    single dollar; and now they have a home of their own, and\r\n    several acres attached--five altogether; but, as that was rather\r\n    small, her husband has contracted for two hundred and forty\r\n    acres more, and has now gone out and commenced operations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Columbiana, February 20th, she wrote concerning her work, and\r\npresented the \"lights and shades\" of affairs as they came under her\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I am almost constantly either traveling or speaking. I do not\r\n    think that I have missed more than one Sunday that I have not\r\n    addressed some Sunday-school, and I have not missed many\r\n    day-schools either. And as I am giving all my lectures free the\r\n    proceeds of the collections are not often very large; still as\r\n    ignorant as part of the people are perhaps a number of them\r\n    would not hear at all, and may be prejudice others if I charged\r\n    even ten cents, and so perhaps in the long run, even if my work\r\n    is wearing, I may be of some real benefit to my race.  *  *  I\r\n    don't know but that you would laugh if you were to hear some of\r\n    the remarks which my lectures call forth: 'She is a man,' again\r\n    'She is not colored, she is painted.' Both white and colored\r\n    come out to hear me, and I have very fine meetings; and then\r\n    part of the time I am talking in between times, and how tired I\r\n    am some of the time. Still I am standing with my race on the\r\n    threshold of a new era, and though some be far past me in the\r\n    learning of the schools, yet to-day, with my limited and\r\n    fragmentary knowledge, I may help the race forward a little.\r\n    Some of our people remind me of sheep without a shepherd.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIVATE LECTURES TO FREEDWOMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nDesiring to speak to women who have been the objects of so much wrong\r\nand abuse under Slavery, and even since Emancipation, in a state of\r\nignorance, not accessible always to those who would or could urge the\r\nproper kind of education respecting their morals and general\r\nimprovement, Mrs. Harper has made it her business not to overlook this\r\nall important duty to her poor sisters.\r\n\r\nThe following extract taken from a letter dated \"Greenville, Georgia,\r\nMarch 29th,\" will show what she was doing in this direction:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"But really my hands are almost constantly full of work;\r\n    sometimes I speak twice a day. Part of my lectures are given\r\n    privately to women, and for them I never make any charge, or\r\n    take up any collection. But this part of the country reminds me\r\n    of heathen ground, and though my work may not be recognized as\r\n    part of it used to be in the North, yet never perhaps were my\r\n    services more needed; and according to their intelligence and\r\n    means perhaps never better appreciated than here among these\r\n    lowly people. I am now going to have a private meeting with the\r\n    women of this place if they will come out. I am going to talk\r\n    with them about their daughters, and about things connected with\r\n    the welfare of the race. Now is the time for our women to begin\r\n    to try to lift up their heads and plant the roots of progress\r\n    under the hearthstone. Last night I spoke in a school-house,\r\n    where there was not, to my knowledge, a single window glass;\r\n    to-day I write to you in a lowly cabin, where the windows in the\r\n    room are formed by two apertures in the wall. There is a\r\n    wide-spread and almost universal appearance of poverty in this\r\n    State where I have been, but thus far I have seen no, or\r\n    scarcely any, pauperism. I am not sure that I have seen any. The\r\n    climate is so fine, so little cold that poor people can live off\r\n    of less than they can in the North. Last night my table was\r\n    adorned with roses, although I did not get one cent for my\r\n    lecture.\"  *  *  *\r\n\r\n    \"The political heavens are getting somewhat overcast. Some of\r\n    this old rebel element, I think, are in favor of taking away the\r\n    colored man's vote, and if he loses it now it may be generations\r\n    before he gets it again. Well, after all perhaps the colored man\r\n    generally is not really developed enough to value his vote and\r\n    equality with other races, so he gets enough to eat and drink,\r\n    and be comfortable, perhaps the loss of his vote would not be a\r\n    serious grievance to many; but his children differently educated\r\n    and trained by circumstances might feel political inferiority\r\n    rather a bitter cup.\"\r\n\r\n    \"After all whether they encourage or discourage me, I belong to\r\n    this race, and when it is down I belong to a down race; when it\r\n    is up I belong to a risen race.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nShe writes thus from Montgomery, December 29th, 1870:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Did you ever read a little poem commencing, I think, with these\r\n    words:\r\n\r\n\r\n      A mother cried, Oh, give me joy,\r\n      For I have born a darling boy!\r\n      A darling boy! why the world is full\r\n      Of the men who play at push and pull.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Well, as full as the room was of beds and tenants, on the\r\n    morning of the twenty-second, there arose a wail upon the air,\r\n    and this mundane sphere had another inhabitant, and my room\r\n    another occupant. I left after that, and when I came back the\r\n    house was fuller than it was before, and my hostess gave me to\r\n    understand that she would rather I should be somewhere else, and\r\n    I left again. How did I fare? Well, I had been stopping with one\r\n    of our teachers and went back; but the room in which I stopped\r\n    was one of those southern shells through which both light and\r\n    cold enter at the same time; it had one window and perhaps more\r\n    than half or one half the panes gone. I don't know that I was\r\n    ever more conquered by the cold than I had been at that house,\r\n    and I have lived parts of winter after winter amid the snows of\r\n    New England; but if it was cold out of doors, there was warmth\r\n    and light within doors; but here, if you opened the door for\r\n    light, the cold would also enter, and so part of the time I sat\r\n    by the fire, and that and the crevices in the house supplied me\r\n    with light in one room, and we had the deficient window-sash, or\r\n    perhaps it never had had any lights in it. You could put your\r\n    finger through some of the apertures in the house; at least I\r\n    could mine, and the water froze down to the bottom of the\r\n    tumbler. From another such domicile may kind fate save me. And\r\n    then the man asked me four dollars and a half a week board.\r\n\r\n    One of the nights there was no fire in the stove, and the next\r\n    time we had fires, one stove might have been a second-hand\r\n    chamber stove. Now perhaps you think these people very poor, but\r\n    the man with whom I stopped has no family that I saw, but\r\n    himself and wife, and he would make two dollars and a half a\r\n    day, and she worked out and kept a boarder. And yet, except the\r\n    beds and bed clothing, I wouldn't have given fifteen dollars for\r\n    all their house furniture. I should think that this has been one\r\n    of the lowest down States in the South, as far as civilization\r\n    has been concerned. In the future, until these people are\r\n    educated, look out for Democratic victories, for here are two\r\n    materials with which Democracy can work, ignorance and poverty.\r\n    Men talk about missionary work among the heathen, but if any\r\n    lover of Christ wants a field for civilizing work, here is a\r\n    field. Part of the time I am preaching against men ill-treating\r\n    their wives. I have heard though, that often during the war men\r\n    hired out their wives and drew their pay.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"And then there is another trouble, some of our Northern men\r\n    have been down this way and by some means they have not made the\r\n    best impression on every mind here. One woman here has been\r\n    expressing her mind very freely to me about some of our\r\n    Northerners, and we are not all considered here as saints and\r\n    angels, and of course in their minds I get associated with some\r\n    or all the humbugs that have been before me. But I am not\r\n    discouraged, my race needs me, if I will only be faithful, and\r\n    in spite of suspicion and distrust, I will work on; the deeper\r\n    our degradation, the louder our call for redemption. If they\r\n    have little or no faith in goodness and earnestness, that is\r\n    only one reason why we should be more faithful and earnest, and\r\n    so I shall probably stay here in the South all winter. I am not\r\n    making much money, and perhaps will hardly clear expenses this\r\n    winter; but after all what matters it when I am in my grave\r\n    whether I have been rich or poor, loved or hated, despised or\r\n    respected, if Christ will only own me to His Father, and I be\r\n    permitted a place in one of the mansions of rest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCol. J.W. Forney, editor of \"The Press,\" published July 12, 1871, with\r\nthe brief editorial heading by his own hand, the document appended:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following letter, written by Mrs. F.E.W. Harper, the\r\n    well-known colored orator, to a friend, Mr. Wm. Still, of\r\n    Philadelphia, will be read with surprise and pleasure by all\r\n    classes; especially supplemented as it is by an article from the\r\n    Mobile (Alabama) _Register,_ referring to one of her addresses\r\n    in that city. The _Register_ is the organ of the fire-eaters of\r\n    the South, conducted by John Forsyth, heretofore one of the most\r\n    intolerant of that school. Mrs. Harper describes the manner in\r\n    which the old plantation of Jefferson Davis in Mississippi was\r\n    cultivated by his brother's former slave, having been a guest in\r\n    the Davis mansion, now occupied by Mr. Montgomery, the aforesaid\r\n    slave. She also draws a graphic picture of her own marvellous\r\n    advancement from utter obscurity to the platform of a public\r\n    lecturer, honored by her own race and applauded by their\r\n    oppressors. While we regret, as she says, that her experience\r\n    and that of Mr. Montgomery is exceptional, it is easy to\r\n    anticipate the harvest of such a sowing. The same culture--the\r\n    same courage on the part of the men and women who undertake to\r\n    advocate Republican doctrines in the South--the same\r\n    perseverance and intelligence on the part of those who are\r\n    earning their bread by the cultivation of the soil, will be\r\n    crowned with the same success. Violence, bloodshed, and murder\r\n    cannot rule long in communities where these resistless elements\r\n    are allowed to work. No scene in the unparalleled tragedy of the\r\n    rebellion, or in the drama which succeeded that tragedy, can be\r\n    compared to the picture outlined by Mrs. Harper herself, and\r\n    filled in by the ready pen of the rebel editor of the Mobile\r\n    _Register_:\r\n\r\n\r\n        MOBILE, July 5, 1871.\r\n\r\n        MY DEAR FRIEND:--It is said that truth is stranger than\r\n        fiction; and if ten years since some one had entered my\r\n        humble log house and seen me kneading bread and making\r\n        butter, and said that in less than ten years you will be\r\n        in the lecture field, you will be a welcome guest under\r\n        the roof of the President of the Confederacy, though not\r\n        by special invitation from him, that you will see his\r\n        brother's former slave a man of business and influence,\r\n        that hundreds of colored men will congregate on the old\r\n        baronial possessions, that a school will spring up there\r\n        like a well in the desert dust, that this former slave\r\n        will be a magistrate upon that plantation, that labor\r\n        will be organized upon a new basis, and that under the\r\n        sole auspices and moulding hands of this man and his\r\n        sons will be developed a business whose transactions\r\n        will be numbered in hundreds of thousands of dollars,\r\n        would you not have smiled incredulously? And I have\r\n        lived to see the day when the plantation has passed into\r\n        new hands, and these hands once wore the fetters of\r\n        slavery. Mr. Montgomery, the present proprietor by\r\n        contract of between five and six thousand acres of land,\r\n        has one of the most interesting families that I have\r\n        ever seen in the South. They are building up a future\r\n        which if exceptional now I hope will become more general\r\n        hereafter. Every hand of his family is adding its quota\r\n        to the success of this experiment of a colored man both\r\n        trading and farming on an extensive scale. Last year his\r\n        wife took on her hands about 130 acres of land, and with\r\n        her force she raised about 107 bales of cotton. She has\r\n        a number of orphan children employed, and not only does\r\n        she supervise their labor, but she works herself. One\r\n        daughter, an intelligent young lady, is postmistress and\r\n        I believe assistant book-keeper. One son attends to the\r\n        planting interest, and another daughter attends to one\r\n        of the stores. The business of this firm of Montgomery &\r\n        Sons has amounted, I understand, to between three and\r\n        four hundred thousand dollars in a year. I stayed on the\r\n        place several days and was hospitably entertained and\r\n        kindly treated. When I come, if nothing prevents, I will\r\n        tell you more about them. Now for the next strange\r\n        truth. Enclosed I send you a notice from one of the\r\n        leading and representative papers of rebeldom. The\r\n        editor has been, or is considered, one of the\r\n        representative men of the South. I have given a lecture\r\n        since this notice, which brought out some of the most\r\n        noted rebels, among whom was Admiral Semmes. In my\r\n        speech I referred to the Alabama sweeping away our\r\n        commerce, and his son sat near him and seemed to receive\r\n        it with much good humor. I don't know what the papers\r\n        will say to-day; perhaps they will think that I dwelt\r\n        upon the past too much. Oh, if you had seen the rebs I\r\n        had out last night, perhaps you would have felt a little\r\n        nervous for me. However, I lived through it, and gave\r\n        them more gospel truth than perhaps some of them have\r\n        heard for some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LECTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    We received a polite invitation from the trustees of the\r\n    State-street African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church to attend a\r\n    lecture in that edifice on Thursday evening. Being told that the\r\n    discourse would be delivered by a female colored lecturer from\r\n    Maryland, curiosity, as well as an interest to see how the\r\n    colored citizens were managing their own institutions, led us at\r\n    once to accept the invitation. We found a very spacious church,\r\n    gas-light, and the balustrades of the galleries copiously hung\r\n    with wreaths and festoons of flowers, and a large audience of\r\n    both sexes, which, both in appearance and behaviour, was\r\n    respectable and decorously observant of the proprieties of the\r\n    place. The services were opened, as usual, with prayer and a\r\n    hymn, the latter inspired by powerful lungs, and in which the\r\n    musical ear at once caught the negro talent for melody. The\r\n    lecturer was then introduced as Mrs. F.E.W. Harper, from\r\n    Maryland. Without a moment's hesitation she started off in the\r\n    flow of her discourse, which rolled smoothly and uninterruptedly\r\n    on for nearly two hours. It was very apparent that it was not a\r\n    cut and dried speech, for she was as fluent and as felicitous in\r\n    her allusions to circumstances immediately around her as she was\r\n    when she rose to a more exalted pitch of laudation of the\r\n    \"Union,\" or of execration of the old slavery system. Her voice\r\n    was remarkable--as sweet as any woman's voice we ever heard, and\r\n    so clear and distinct as to pass every syllable to the most\r\n    distant ear in the house.\r\n\r\n    Without any effort at attentive listening we followed the\r\n    speaker to the end, not discerning a single grammatical\r\n    inaccuracy of speech, or the slightest violation of good taste\r\n    in manner or matter. At times the current of thoughts flowed in\r\n    eloquent and poetic expression, and often her quaint humor would\r\n    expose the ivory in half a thousand mouths. We confess that we\r\n    began to wonder, and we asked a fine-looking man before us,\r\n    \"What is her color? Is she dark or light?\" He answered, \"She is\r\n    mulatto; what they call a red mulatto.\" The 'red' was new to us.\r\n    Our neighbor asked, \"How do you like her?\" We replied, \"She is\r\n    giving your people the best kind and the very wisest of advice.\"\r\n    He rejoined, \"I wish I had her education.\" To which we added,\r\n    \"That's just what she tells you is your great duty and your\r\n    need, and if you are too old to get it yourselves, you must give\r\n    it to your children.\"\r\n\r\n    The speaker left the impression on our mind that she was not\r\n    only intelligent and educated, but--the great end of\r\n    education--she was enlightened. She comprehends perfectly the\r\n    situation of her people, to whose interests she seems ardently\r\n    devoted. The main theme of her discourse, the one string to the\r\n    harmony of which all the others were attuned, was the grand\r\n    opportunity that emancipation had afforded to the black race to\r\n    lift itself to the level of the duties and responsibilities\r\n    enjoined by it. \"You have muscle power and brain power,\" she\r\n    said; \"you must utilize them, or be content to remain forever\r\n    the inferior race. Get land, every one that can, and as fast as\r\n    you ean. A landless people must be dependent upon the landed\r\n    people. A few acres to till for food and a roof, however bumble,\r\n    over your head, are the castle of your independence, and when\r\n    you have it you are fortified to act and vote independently\r\n    whenever your interests are at stake.\" That part of her lecture\r\n    (and there was much of it) that dwelt on the moral duties and\r\n    domestic relations of the colored people was pitched on the\r\n    highest key of sound morality. She urged the cultivation of the\r\n    \"home life,\" the sanctity of the marriage state (a happy\r\n    contrast to her strong-minded, free-love, white sisters of the\r\n    North), and the duties of mothers to their daughters. \"Why,\"\r\n    said she in a voice of much surprise, \"I have actually heard\r\n    since I have been South that sometimes colored husbands\r\n    positively beat their wives! I do not mean to insinuate for a\r\n    moment that such things can possibly happen in Mobile. The very\r\n    appearance of this congregation forbids it; but I did hear of\r\n    one terrible husband defending himself for the unmanly practice\r\n    with 'Well, I have got to whip her or leave her.'\"\r\n\r\n    There were parts of the lecturer's discourse that grated a\r\n    little on a white Southern ear, but it was lost and forgiven in\r\n    the genuine earnestness and profound good sense with which the\r\n    woman spoke to her kind in words of sound advice.\r\n\r\n    On the whole, we are very glad we accepted the Zion's\r\n    invitation. It gave us much food for new thought. It reminded\r\n    us, perhaps, of neglected duties to these people, and it\r\n    impressed strongly on our minds that these people are getting\r\n    along, getting onward, and progress was a star becoming familiar\r\n    to their gaze and their desires. Whatever the negroes have done\r\n    in the path of advancement, they have done largely without white\r\n    aid. But politics and white pride have kept the white people\r\n    aloof from offering that earnest and moral assistance which\r\n    would be so useful to a people just starting from infancy into a\r\n    life of self-dependence.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn writing from Columbiana and Demopolis, Alabama, about the first of\r\nMarch, 1871, Mrs. Harper painted the state of affairs in her usually\r\ngraphic manner, and diligently was she endeavoring to inspire the people\r\nwith hope and encouragement.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, what a field there is here in this region! Let me give you\r\n    a short account of this week's work. Sunday I addressed a\r\n    Sunday-school in Taladega; on Monday afternoon a day-school. On\r\n    Monday I rode several miles to a meeting; addressed it, and came\r\n    back the same night. Got back about or after twelve o'clock. The\r\n    next day I had a meeting of women and addressed them, and then\r\n    lectured in the evening in the Court-House to both colored and\r\n    white. Last night I spoke again, about ten miles from where I am\r\n    now stopping, and returned the same night, and to-morrow evening\r\n    probably I shall speak again. I grow quite tired part of the\r\n    time.  *  *  *  And now let me give you an anecdote or two of\r\n    some of our new citizens. While in Taladega I was entertained\r\n    and well entertained, at the house of one of our new citizens.\r\n    He is living in the house of his former master. He is a\r\n    brick-maker by trade, and I rather think mason also. He was\r\n    worth to his owner, it was reckoned, fifteen hundred or about\r\n    that a year. He worked with him seven years; and in that seven\r\n    years he remembers receiving from him fifty cents. Now mark the\r\n    contrast! That man is now free, owns the home of his former\r\n    master, has I think more than sixty acres of land, and his\r\n    master is in the poor-house. I heard of another such case not\r\n    long since: A woman was cruelly treated once, or more than once.\r\n    She escaped and ran naked into town. The villain in whose clutch\r\n    she found herself was trying to drag her downward to his own low\r\n    level of impurity, and at last she fell. She was poorly fed, so\r\n    that she was tempted to sell her person. Even scraps thrown to\r\n    the dog she was hunger-bitten enough to aim for. Poor thing, was\r\n    there anything in the future for her? Had not hunger and cruelty\r\n    and prostitution done their work, and left her an entire wreck\r\n    for life? It seems not. Freedom came, and with it dawned a new\r\n    era upon that poor, overshadowed, and sin-darkened life. Freedom\r\n    brought opportunity for work and wages combined. She went to\r\n    work, and got ten dollars a month. She has contrived to get some\r\n    education, and has since been teaching school. While her former\r\n    mistress has been to her for help.\r\n\r\n    \"Do not the mills of God grind exceedingly fine? And she has\r\n    helped that mistress, and so has the colored man given money,\r\n    from what I heard, to his former master. After all, friend, do\r\n    we not belong to one of the best branches of the human race? And\r\n    yet, how have our people been murdered in the South, and their\r\n    bones scattered at the grave's mouth! Oh, when will we have a\r\n    government strong enough to make human life safe? Only yesterday\r\n    I heard of a murder committed on a man for an old grudge of\r\n    several years' standing. I had visited the place, but had just\r\n    got away. Last summer a Mr. Luke was hung, and several other men\r\n    also, I heard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile surrounded with this state of affairs, an appeal reached her\r\nthrough the columns of the National Standard, setting forth a state of\r\nvery great suffering and want, especially on the part of the old, blind\r\nand decrepit Freedmen of the District of Columbia. After expressing deep\r\npity for these unfortunates, she added: \"Please send ten dollars to\r\nJosephine Griffing for me for the suffering poor of the District of\r\nColumbia. Just send it by mail, and charge to my account.\"\r\n\r\nMany more letters written by Mrs. Harper are before us, containing\r\nhighly interesting information from Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida,\r\nNorth Carolina, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Maryland, and\r\neven poor little Delaware. Through all these States she has traveled and\r\nlabored extensively, as has been already stated; but our space in this\r\nvolume will admit of only one more letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I have been traveling the best part of the day.  *  *  *  Can\r\n    you spare a little time from your book to just take a peep at\r\n    some of our Alabama people? If you would see some instances of\r\n    apparent poverty and ignorance that I have seen perhaps you\r\n    would not wonder very much at the conservative voting in the\r\n    State. A few days since I was about to pay a woman a dollar and\r\n    a quarter for some washing in ten cent (currency) notes, when\r\n    she informed me that she could not count it; she must trust to\r\n    my honesty--she could count forty cents. Since I left Eufaula I\r\n    have seen something of plantation life. The first plantation I\r\n    visited was about five or six miles from Eufaula, and I should\r\n    think that the improvement in some of the cabins was not very\r\n    much in advance of what it was in Slavery. The cabins are made\r\n    with doors, but not, to my recollection, a single window pane or\r\n    speck of plastering; and yet even in some of those lowly homes I\r\n    met with hospitality. A room to myself is a luxury that I do not\r\n    always enjoy. Still I live through it, and find life rather\r\n    interesting. The people have much to learn. The condition of the\r\n    women is not very enviable in some cases. They have had some of\r\n    them a terribly hard time in Slavery, and their subjection has\r\n    not ceased in freedom.  *  *  *  One man said of some women,\r\n    that a man must leave them or whip them.  *  *  *  Let me\r\n    introduce you to another scene: here is a gathering; a large\r\n    fire is burning out of doors, and here are one or two boys with\r\n    hats on. Here is a little girl with her bonnet on, and there a\r\n    little boy moves off and commences to climb a tree. Do you know\r\n    what the gathering means? It is a school, and the teacher, I\r\n    believe, is paid from the school fund. He says he is from New\r\n    Hampshire. That may be. But to look at him and to hear him\r\n    teach, you would perhaps think him not very lately from the\r\n    North; at least I do not think he is a model teacher. They have\r\n    a church; but somehow they have burnt a hole, I understand, in\r\n    the top, and so I lectured inside, and they gathered around the\r\n    fire outside. Here is another--what shall I call\r\n    it?--meeting-place. It is a brush arbor. And what pray is that?\r\n    Shall I call it an edifice or an improvised meeting-house? Well,\r\n    it is called a brush arbor. It is a kind of brush house with\r\n    seats, and a kind of covering made partly, I rather think, of\r\n    branches of trees, and an humble place for pulpit. I lectured in\r\n    a place where they seemed to have no other church; but I spoke\r\n    at a house. In Glenville, a little out-of-the-way place, I spent\r\n    part of a week. There they have two unfinished churches. One has\r\n    not a single pane of glass, and the same aperture that admits\r\n    the light also gives ingress to the air; and the other one, I\r\n    rather think, is less finished than that. I spoke in one, and\r\n    then the white people gave me a hall, and quite a number\r\n    attended.... I am now at Union Springs, where I shall probably\r\n    room with three women. But amid all this roughing it in the\r\n    bush, I find a field of work where kindness and hospitality have\r\n    thrown their sunshine around my way. And Oh what a field of work\r\n    is here! How much one needs the Spirit of our dear Master to\r\n    make one's life a living, loving force to help men to higher\r\n    planes of thought and action. I am giving all my lectures with\r\n    free admission; but still I get along, and the way has been\r\n    opening for me almost ever since I have been South. Oh, if some\r\n    more of our young women would only consecrate their lives to the\r\n    work of upbuilding the race! Oh, if I could only see our young\r\n    men and women aiming to build up a future for themselves which\r\n    would grandly contrast with the past--with its pain, ignorance\r\n    and low social condition.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be well to add that Mrs. Harper's letters from which we have\r\ncopied were simply private, never intended for publication; and while\r\nthey bear obvious marks of truthfulness, discrimination and\r\nimpartiality, it becomes us to say that a more strictly conscientious\r\nwoman we have never known.\r\n\r\nReturning to Philadelphia after many months of hard labor in the South,\r\nMrs. Harper, instead of seeking needed rest and recreation, scarcely\r\nallows a day to pass without seeking to aid in the reformation of the\r\noutcast and degraded. The earnest advice which she gives on the subject\r\nof temperance and moral reforms generally causes some to reflect, even\r\namong adults, and induces a number of poor children to attend day and\r\nSabbath-schools. The condition of this class, she feels, appeals loudly\r\nfor a remedy to respectable and intelligent colored citizens; and whilst\r\nnot discouraged, she is often quite saddened at the supineness of the\r\nbetter class. During the past summer when it was too warm to labor in\r\nthe South she spent several months in this field without a farthing's\r\nreward. She assisted in organizing a Sabbath-school, and accepted the\r\noffice of Assistant Superintendent under the auspices of the Young Men's\r\nChristian Association.\r\n\r\nMrs. Harper reads the best magazines and ablest weeklies, as well as\r\nmore elaborate works, not excepting such authors as De Tocqueville,\r\nMill, Ruskin, Buckle, Guizot, &c. In espousing the cause of the\r\noppressed as a poet and lecturer, had she neglected to fortify her mind\r\nin the manner she did, she would have been weighed and found wanting\r\nlong since. Before friends and foes, the learned and the unlearned,\r\nNorth and South, Mrs. Harper has pleaded the cause of her race in a\r\nmanner that has commanded the greatest respect; indeed, it is hardly too\r\nmuch to say, that during seventeen years of public labor she has made\r\nthousands of speeches without doing herself or people discredit in a\r\nsingle instance, but has accomplished a great deal in the way of\r\nremoving prejudice. May we not hope that the rising generation at least\r\nwill take encouragement by her example and find an argument of rare\r\nforce in favor of mental and moral equality, and above all be awakened\r\nto see how prejudices and difficulties may be surmounted by continual\r\nstruggles, intelligence and a virtuous character?\r\n\r\nFifty thousand copies at least of her four small books have been sold to\r\nthose who have listened to her eloquent lectures. One of those\r\nproductions entitled \"Moses\" has been used to entertain audiences with\r\nevening readings in various parts of the country. With what effect may\r\nbe seen from the two brief notices as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Mrs. F.E.W. Harper delivered a poem upon 'Moses' in Wilbraham\r\n    to a large and delighted audience. She is a woman of high moral\r\n    tone, with superior native powers highly cultivated, and a\r\n    captivating eloquence that hold her audience in rapt attention\r\n    from the beginning to the close. She will delight any\r\n    intelligent audience, and those who wish first-class lecturers\r\n    cannot do better than to secure her services.\"--_Zion's Herald,\r\n    Boston._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Mrs. Frances E.W. Harper read her poem of 'Moses' last evening\r\n    at Rev. Mr. Harrison's church to a good audience. It deals with\r\n    the story of the Hebrew Moses from his finding in the wicker\r\n    basket on the Nile to his death on Mount Nebo and his burial in\r\n    an unknown grave; following closely the Scripture account. It\r\n    contains about 700 lines, beginning with blank verse of the\r\n    common measure, and changing to other measures, but always\r\n    without rhyme; and is a pathetic and well-sustained piece. Mrs.\r\n    Harper recited it with good effect, and it was well received.\r\n    She is a lady of much talent, and always speaks well,\r\n    particularly when her subject relates to the condition of her\r\n    own people, in whose welfare, before and since the war, she has\r\n    taken the deepest interest. As a lecturer Mrs. Harper is more\r\n    effective than most of those who come before our lyceums; with a\r\n    natural eloquence that is very moving.\"--_Galesburgh Register,\r\n    Ill._\r\n\r\n\r\nGrace Greenwood, in the Independent in noticing a Course of Lectures in\r\nwhich Mrs. Harper spoke (in Philadelphia) pays this tribute to her:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Next on the course was Mrs Harper, a colored woman; about as\r\n    colored as some of the Cuban belles I have met with at Saratoga.\r\n    She has a noble head, this bronze muse; a strong face, with a\r\n    shadowed glow upon it, indicative of thoughtful fervor, and of a\r\n    nature most femininely sensitive, but not in the least morbid.\r\n    Her form is delicate, her hands daintily small. She stands\r\n    quietly beside her desk, and speaks without notes, with gestures\r\n    few and fitting. Her manner is marked by dignity and composure.\r\n    She is never assuming, never theatrical. In the first part of\r\n    her lecture she was most impressive in her pleading for the race\r\n    with whom her lot is cast. There was something touching in her\r\n    attitude as their representative. The woe of two hundred years\r\n    sighed through her tones. Every glance of her sad eyes was a\r\n    mournful remonstrance against injustice and wrong. Feeling on\r\n    her soul, as she must have felt it, the chilling weight of\r\n    caste, she seemed to say:\r\n\r\n      'I lift my heavy heart up solemnly,\r\n      As once Eleotra her sepulchral urn.'\r\n\r\n\r\n    ... As I listened to her, there swept over me, in a chill wave\r\n    of horror, the realization that this noble woman had she not\r\n    been rescued from her mother's condition, might have been sold\r\n    on the auction-block, to the highest bidder--her intellect,\r\n    fancy, eloquence, the flashing wit, that might make the delight\r\n    of a Parisian saloon, and her pure, Christian character all\r\n    thrown in--the recollection that women like her could be dragged\r\n    out of public conveyances in our own city, or frowned out of\r\n    fashionable churches by Anglo-Saxon saints.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE,                                                     1-6.\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS,                                               7, 8.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS,                                                    9-21.\r\n\r\nAnthony, Kit, and wife Leah, and three children,\r\nAdam, Mary, and Murry,                                       99.\r\n\r\nAmby, Nat,                                                   102.\r\n\r\nAmby, Elizabeth,                                             102.\r\n\r\nAugusta, John, (letter.)                                     110.\r\n\r\nAnderson, Henry, alias Wm.

I cannot think of it without a throbbing heart.\r\n\r\nYou do well to commemorate those associated with it by service or by\r\nbenefit--the saviors and the saved. The army of the late war has had its\r\n\"Roll of Honor.\" You will give us two other, rolls, worthy of equal\r\nhonor--the roll of fugitives from slavery, helped on their way to\r\nfreedom, and also the roll of their self-sacrificing benefactors. I\r\nalways hesitated which to honor most, the fugitive slave or the citizen\r\nwho helped him, in defiance of unjust laws.

It\r\nwill doubtless be a work of great interest to many of our citizens.\r\n\r\n_FROM THE NORTH AMERICAN AND  U.S. GAZETTE._\r\n\r\nHere is an authority that cannot be questioned, competent and correct by\r\nmany endorsements, that shows without argument, after the true pattern\r\nof Herodotus and the chroniclers, what slavery in America was in the\r\ndecade immediately preceding its overthrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_FROM THE \"PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER.\"_\r\n\r\n\"Never before has the working of the Underground Railroad been so\r\nthoroughly explained. Here we have in complete detail the various\r\nmethods adopted for circumventing the enemies of freedom, and told, as\r\nit is, with great simplicity and natural feeling, the narrative is one\r\nwhich cannot but make a deep impression. Thrilling incidents, heroic\r\nadventures and noble deeds of self-sacrigce light up every page, and\r\nwill enlist the heartiest sympathies of all generous souls. It was\r\neminently just that such a record of one of the most remarkable phases\r\nof the struggle against slavery should be prepared, that the memory of\r\nthe noble originators and supporters of the railroad might be kept\r\ngreen, and posterity enabled to form a true conception of the necessity\r\nthat called it into existence, and of the difficulties under which its\r\nwork was performed. The labor of compiling could not have fallen into\r\nmore appropriate or better qualified hands.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_FROM THE \"BALTIMORE AMERICAN.\"_\r\n\r\nMr. Still was one of the most courageous managers on the Underground\r\nRalroad, and is therefore well qualified to be its historian. He speaks\r\nof his own services with modesty, and, in fact, there is no attempt at\r\nexaggeration in any one of the most wonderful series of narratives which\r\nhe relates. Baltimore was one of the great depots from which the\r\ntrembling fugitives set out on their trip to Canada, and Mr. Still deals\r\nfreely with the names of person, yet living, who, no doubt, would be\r\nvery glad if this most extraordinary book had never been published. It\r\nwas their misfortune to have furnished a number of passengers for the\r\n\"Underground Railroad,\" and now they cannot escape being named in\r\nconnection with the slaves, who dared, everything for liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO BULLETIN._\r\n\r\nWe have often longed to know how the drab-coated philanthropists of\r\nPhiladelphia managed to furnish systematic assistance to the slave\r\nfugitives, and the desire is now gratified. William Still, for many\r\nyears connected with the anti-slavery office in Philadelphia, and the\r\nchairman of the Acting Vigilance Committee of the Philadelphia Branch of\r\nthe Underground Railroad, has written a ponderous volume, entitled \"THE\r\nUNDERGROUND RALROAD.\" ... He has performed his work well. The volume\r\nbefore us, though containing nearly 800 pages, is not elaborated beyond\r\nnecessity, and fairly teems with interesting sketches.\r\n\r\n_FROM BISHOP PAYNE OF THE A.M.E. CHURCH, PHILADELPHIA._\r\n\r\nMy official engagements and private duties have prevented me from\r\nreading your work on THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD, throughout. But such\r\nportions as I have had time to read, convince me that as a stimulus to\r\nnoble effort it has much value. It is also a grand _monument_ of the\r\npast struggles of the Angel Spirit of Liberty with the Demon of American\r\nSlavery. It serves also as a Beacon Light for our future progress in the\r\nupward movement. It deserves a wide circulation through the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I cheerfully endorse the above.\"\r\n\r\nS.M.D. WARD. (Bishop A.M.E. Church.)\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_FROM LETTER OF HON. EBENEZER D. BASSETT, U.S. MINISTER TO HAITI._\r\n\r\nThe book must strike everyone who sees it as one of very commendable\r\nappearance; and to everyone who reads it, it must commend itself as one\r\nof remarkable interest. It is a work which cannot fail to reflect an\r\nunusual credit upon the care, industry and sterling ability of its\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nAll hail to you, my dear fellow, for your success. When nearly four\r\nyears ago you spoke often to me about your project of writing this book,\r\nI always told you I thought it would prove a success; but I tell you\r\nnow, candidly, that although I never for a moment doubted your peculiar\r\nfitness to prepare such a work, yet I feared that when you came to see\r\nthe time, industry, care and patience, which it would require aside from\r\nyour pressing everyday business cares and perplexities, you might stop\r\nat the foot of the mountain and abandon the tedious ascent. But you have\r\nactually made the ascent and stand now on the top of the mountain.\r\nHurrah for my old friend Still! Hurrah! Hurrah!! Hurrah!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_FROM. PROF. W. HOWARD DAY, IN \"OUR NATIONAL PROGRESS.\"_\r\n\r\nIn his singularly and creditably brief preface, Mr. Still sincerely\r\ndisclaims literary pretension; but creditable as is this to the author,\r\nwe may say that the work is in style excellent reading, and that if it\r\nwere not so, the narratives themselves are so thrilling, possess such a\r\nheart-reaching interest, that if these were literary crudities, they\r\nwould be entirely placed in the background in the concentrated blaze of\r\nlight which the author pours upon the bloody pathway of these victims of\r\ninjustice, from 1851, when the terrors of the Fugitive Slave Law began,\r\nto the hour when Slavery and Rebellion were washed out in blood,\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nWe have not space for a reprint of one of these interesting histories,\r\nbut we are personally acquainted with the \"facts\" as related by Mr.\r\nStill, and the persons involved, and can attest the truth of the\r\nstatements made. Some of these parties we have met in their flight,\r\nothers in their temporary sojourn in the then so-called Free States;\r\nothers we knew (Harriet Tubman and Moses among them) in their latest and\r\nsafest refuge, (Canada,) under the protection of the Cross of St. George\r\nand St. Andrew. It was due to such that this book should be written.\r\nTheir heroic deeds, in behalf of personal liberty of themselves and\r\nothers, deserve commemorating. Their deeds of daring, winning victory at\r\nlast, in the face of wily and unscrupulous men devoted to their capture,\r\nand sustained by the voice, the law and the cannon of the Government,\r\nought to be written in unfading letters across the history of a people\r\nstruggling upward to enfranchisement. It will teach the coming\r\ngenerations who were our fathers and our mothers; who there were in\r\nthese years of agony who braved death to secure liberty and who upheld\r\nthe noble banner of a dying race until their efforts, by God's blessing,\r\nmade the race rise and live. All thanks to Mr. Still for thus placing\r\nthis noble record of the free, and those struggling to be free, before\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_FROM, THE BOSTON JOURNAL, BOSTON, MASS._\r\n\r\nThe present volume is a narrative, or rather a collection of narratives,\r\nof the adventures of slaves on their way to freedom. The style is\r\nperfectly simple and unaffected, and it is well that it is so. The facts\r\nand incidents related are themselves so full of interest and dramatic\r\nintenseness as to need no coloring. The narratives throughout have the\r\nmark of truth upon them, and are based on authentic records. American\r\nhistory would not be complete without some such book as this, written by\r\none within the circle of those devoted philanthropists who were so\r\nfearless and unremitting in their efforts for human freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_FROM THE PROVIDENCE PRESS, PROVIDENCE, R.I._\r\n\r\nThis large volume is full of facts. To read its pages is to bring the\r\npast up with vividness. Many of those who fought with the worse than\r\nEphesus' beasts encountered by Paul, to wit, the man-hunters of the\r\nSouth, we knew personally, and their narratives as given in this volume\r\nwe can vouch for, having received their accounts at the time, from their\r\nown lips. Historically the book is valuable, because it is fact and not\r\nfiction, although fifty years from to-day it will read like fiction to\r\nthe then living.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_FROM THE NEWBURYPORT HERALD, MASS._\r\n\r\nIt is not a romance, but it is a storehouse of materials which will\r\nhereafter be used in literature, and be studied, not only by historians,\r\ndramatists and novelists, but also by those who will seek to comprehend\r\nand realize the fact, that there has been, in this country, a condition\r\nof society and law which made the Underground railroad possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM STILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nAN AUTHENTIC RECORD OF THE WONDERFUL HARDSHIPS, HAIRBREADTH ESCAPES, AND\r\nDEATH STRUGGLES WHICH MARK THE TRACK FROM SLAVERY TO FREEDOM IN THE\r\nUNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most remarkable volumes of the century. Its\r\npublication has only been made possible by a combination of\r\ncircumstances which seldom attend the birth of a book. Before\r\nemancipation, and while the bane of slavery was on the country, the\r\nthrilling facts of this volume could not have been made public. Peace\r\nand the blessing of freedom permit their publication, free circulation\r\nand unmolested reading.\r\n\r\nOf all the thousands who favored freedom for the slaves, who gloried in\r\nthe odium attached to anti-slaveryism, who witnessed the frequent\r\nefforts of the bondsmen to escape, who aided them in their quest for\r\nliberty, few dared to take notes of what they witnessed, and fewer still\r\ndared to preserve them, lest they should be turned into witnesses\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\nBut one man, and that the author of this book, is known to have\r\nsucceeded in preserving anything like a full account of the workings of\r\nthe UNDERGROUND RAILROAD, as it was called before emancipation. These\r\nrecords grew on his hands during the years he acted as Chairman of the\r\nPhiladelphia Branch of that celebrated corporation, until they reached\r\nthe extent of the present volume. They are made up of letters received,\r\nof interviews held, of narratives taken down at the time, of real\r\nreminiscence and authentic biography. Nothing imaginative enters into\r\nthe composition of the volume. It is simply succinct history, always\r\nstartling, sometimes bloody. The annals of no time since the Inquisition\r\nare so full of daring ventures for life and liberty or heroic endurance\r\nunder most trying circumstances.\r\n\r\nAs a history of the UNDERGROUND RAILROAD, the work is most curious and\r\nvaluable. It tells of an ingenuity and faithfulness on the part of the\r\nofficials of the road which seems well-nigh marvellous. As its pages\r\nreveal the methods by which aid was given to the escaping slave, one is\r\ncompelled to wonder almost as if he were facing a revelation. The\r\nsecrets of Masonry are not more mysterious than were the ways of these\r\nofficials who clothed, fed and comforted the fugitive, while they\r\napparently never knew his name or whereabouts. Even those who never\r\nbelieved in the existence of an UNDERGROUND RAILWAY, or who, believing,\r\ncursed its existence, will read its history, at this time, with the\r\nrelish of astonishment and the zest of discoverers.\r\n\r\nBut the book has a higher meaning and use. It is curious and hitherto\r\nunprinted history to the white race. To the black race, and especially\r\nthat part of it once slave, it is more than a history of a time of\r\nperil. It is for them what Exodus was to the fugitives from Egypt, a\r\nhistory and an inspiration as well. They may learn from it of their\r\nheroes and how deeply the love of liberty was implanted in their bosoms.\r\nThe Swiss never tire of the story of their Tell, nor the Welsh of that\r\nof their Glendower. Every nation has its exemplar, whose bravery and\r\nvirtues are a perpetual lesson and source of admiration. The colored\r\nrace may now read of its real heroes, its Joshuas, Spartacuses, Tells\r\nand Glendowers, among the list of those who silently broke their chains\r\nand dared everything in order to breathe the sweet air of liberty. They\r\nare not blazoned heroes, full of loud deeds and great names, but quiet\r\nexamples of what fortitude can achieve where freedom is the goal.\r\n\r\nIt is time now that the colored race should know something of the steps\r\nwhich led from Egypt to Canaan, something of their own contributions to\r\nthe grand march of the tribes across and beyond the Red Sea. There are\r\nno slaves beneath the starry flag. All may read who will, and what they\r\nwill. For the colored man no history can be more instructive and\r\ninspiring than this, of his own making, and written by one of his own\r\nrace. The generations are growing in light. Not to know of those who\r\nwere stronger than shackles, who were pioneers in the grand advance\r\ntoward freedom; not to know of what characters the race could produce\r\nwhen straightened by circumstances, nor of those small beginnings which\r\nended in triumphant emancipation, will, in a short time, be a reproach.\r\n\r\nThis History of the hardships and struggles of those of their own race\r\nis more for them than for mankind at large. It furnishes the world proof\r\nthat, though slaves, they were nevertheless men. It furnishes them proof\r\nthat the heroic abounds in their race as in others, and that achievement\r\nfollows persistent effort, as well with them as with others. The volume\r\nwill be not only their admiration but constant encouragement. In its\r\npages one is not invited to hard, dry reading. It is narrative in style,\r\nsimple in language, and possesses the thrill and pathos of a novel. In\r\nall its parts it is an evidence of the saying that \"Truth is stranger\r\nthan fiction.\"\r\n\r\nThe author scarcely needs an introduction to the public. He is a\r\nscholarly, successful business man of Philadelphia, who has long been\r\nidentified with churches, charities and every project for ameliorating\r\nthe condition of his race. His word in all things is as good as his\r\nbond. An ardent member of the Anti-Slavery Society, and an active\r\nofficer of the Underground Railroad Company, he made his book as a\r\nbusiness man makes his ledger, viz.: by noting daily the transactions of\r\nthe day. How he preserved them does not matter much now, but if a\r\ncertain loft in the chapel of an old cemetery could speak, it might a\r\ntale unfold.\r\n\r\nThe volume is quite large and commanding in appearance. It consists of\r\nabout 800 pages, clearly printed on beautiful white paper, making the\r\nlargest book ever written by a colored person in this country.\r\n\r\nAn attractive feature of the book, one which has added largely to its\r\ncost, and one which greatly enhances its value to the reader, is its\r\nillustrations. These are over seventy in number, and they are made to\r\nillustrate the most striking portions of the work. They represent night\r\nescapes and day encounters, on land and river, receptions on the soil of\r\nfreedom, characters of note among the fugitives, and many of those among\r\nthe anti-slavery people whose names have become historic. It is seldom a\r\nvolume is seen which so abounds in apt and striking illustration.\r\n\r\nThe field for the sale of this volume is immense. It will prove\r\ndesirable as a curious contribution to the literature of the times, and\r\nwill be bought in every home North and South, East and West, where\r\nreading is cherished. It is pre-eminently the book for the colored race.\r\nThere is not a colored man or woman in the whole land who will not want\r\nto possess it. Even if he cannot read, he will want it for his children.\r\nIt will be their history and their story for generations.\r\n\r\nWe have fixed the price at a very low figure, so as to completely answer\r\nall pleas of poverty or hard times.\r\n\r\nThe whole book of _800 SUPER-ROYAL OCTAVO PAGES_ is filled with the\r\nthrilling History of the Secret work of the U.G.R.R., giving an\r\nauthentic account of the wonderful Escapes and Daring Deeds, the\r\nEndurance and Sacrifice of men and women in their efforts for freedom.\r\nIt is BEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATED and substantially bound, and furnished at\r\nthe following _VERY LOW PRICES:_\r\n\r\nIN FINE ENGLISH CLOTH, PANNELLED,............... $3.00 IN BEAUTIFUL\r\nEMBOSSED MOROCCO, GILT CENTRE, ...   4.00\r\n\r\nEvery book corresponds with above description or the subscriber is not\r\nbound to take it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEOPLE'S PUBLISHING CO.,\r\n\r\n\r\n26 SO. 7TH ST., PHILADELPHIA, PA., CINCINNATI, O.,\r\n\r\nCHICAGO, ILL., OR, ST. LOUIS, MO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_FROM THE \"NATION,\" N.Y._\r\n\r\nIt is, nevertheless, a chapter in our history which connot be skipped or\r\nobliterated, inasmuch as it marks one stage of the disease of which the\r\ncrisis was passed at Gettysburg. It is one, too, for which we ought not\r\nto be dependent on tradition; and, all things considered, no one was so\r\nwell qualified as Mr. Still to reproduce that phase of it with which he\r\nwas so intimately concerned, as chairman of the Acting Committee of the\r\nVigilance Committee of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nOf all the Border States, Pennsylvania was the most accessible to\r\nfugitives from slavery; and as the organization just named was probably\r\nthe most perfect and efficient of its kind, and served as a distributor\r\nto the branches in other States, its record doubtless covers the larger\r\npart of the field of operations of the Underground Railroad; or, in\r\nother words, of the systematic but secret efforts to promote the escape\r\nof slaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_FROM THE CHRISTIAN UNION, N.Y._\r\n\r\n\"The narratives themselves, told with the simplicity and directness of\r\nobvious truth, are full of terror, of pathos, the shame of human\r\nbaseness and the glory of human virtue; and though the time is not yet\r\nsufficiently distant from the date of their occurrence to give to this\r\nrecord the universal acceptance it deserves, there are few, we think,\r\neven now, who can read it without amazement that such things could be in\r\nour very day, and be regarded with such general apathy. When the\r\nquestion, still so momentous and exciting, of the relations of the two\r\nraces in this country, shall have passed from the vortex of political\r\nstrife and social prejudice, and taken its place among the ethical\r\naxioms of a Christian civilization, then this faithful account of some\r\nof the darkest and some of the brightest incidents in our history--this\r\ncyclopædia of all the virtues and all the vices of humanity--will be\r\naccepted as a most valuable contribution to the annals of one of the\r\nimportant eras of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_FROM THE \"LUTHERAN OBSERVER,\" PHILADELPHIA._\r\n\r\n\"It is a remarkable book in many respects. Like the 'Key to Uncle Tom's\r\nCabin,' by Mrs. Stowe, it reveals many of the most thrilling personal\r\ndramas and tragedies in the entire history of slavery. That 'truth is\r\nstranger than fiction' has hundreds of striking illustrations in this\r\nvolume, which is a narrative of facts, the records of which were kept by\r\nMr. Still, and are the only records in existence of the famous\r\norganization known as the Underground Railroad. It was established for\r\nthe purpose of aiding slaves to escape from their masters in the South,\r\nbut its operations were so mysterious and secret that, although\r\neverybody knew and spoke vaguely of its existence during the time of\r\nslavery, yet none but the initiated knew the secrets of its management\r\nand operations. These are now revealed for the first time in this work,\r\nand are as strange and wonderful as the most absorbing pictures of\r\nromance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_FROM, THE CHRISTIAN RECORDER, PHILA._\r\n\r\nThere has been no such work produced by any colored man in the country.\r\n\"My Bondage and my Freedom,\" by Douglass, was a remarkable book, and was\r\njustly appreciated by the liberty-loving people of the North and of\r\nEngland, but it was the story of a single hero. Comparatively, the same\r\nmay be said of the lives of Jermain Logan and others. But all these were\r\nbut the exploits of individuals. The work of Mr. Still, however, takes a\r\nbroader scope. It is the story of scores of heroes--heroes that equalled\r\nDouglass in nerve, and Logan in tact, and excelled either in thrilling\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_FROM \"ZION'S HERALD,\" BOSTON._\r\n\r\n\"It is a big book in manner, matter, and spirit; the biggest book\r\nAmerica has yet written. It is our 'Book of Martyrs,' and William Still\r\nis our Fox the Chronicler. It is the 'thousand witnesses' of Theodore\r\nWeld, enlarged and intensified. It is more than Uncle Tom, Wilson's\r\n'History of the Anti-slavery War,' or the hundred histories of the war\r\nitself....\r\n\r\n\"The book is well illustrated with portraits of the railroad managers,\r\nand with scenes taken from life, and is far the most entertaining and\r\ninstructive story ever issued from the American press. Everybody should\r\nbuy, read, and transmit to his children these annals of our heroic age.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_FROM THE \"MORNING STAR,\" DOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE._\r\n\r\n\"The work is intensely interesting. Many of the narratives thrill the\r\nreader through and through. Some of them awaken an indignation, a\r\nhorror, or a sense of humiliation and shame that makes the blood curdle\r\nor the cheek flush, or the breathing difficult. The best and the worst\r\nsides of human nature are successfully exhibited. Here heroism and\r\npatience stand out transfigured; there selfishness and brutality hold\r\ncarnival till it seems as though justice had been exiled and God had\r\nforgotten his own. The number of cases reported is very large, and the\r\nmethod in which the author has done his work is commendable. There is no\r\nrhetorical ambition. The narratives are embodied in plain language. The\r\nfacts are left to make their own impression, without an attempt to\r\nembellish them by the aid of imagination. And the work is timely.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_FROM THE \"FRIENDS' REVIEW,\" PHILADELPHIA._\r\n\r\n\"We are glad to see this book. We anticipate for it a large circulation,\r\nand a permanent rank in a peculiar and painful department of history.\r\nThe writer is one among very many who are entitled to the hearty support\r\nof philanthropists for their services rendered, often at considerable\r\nsacrifices and imminent peril, for the rescue and aid of those who were\r\nwickedly held in bondage.... The _Underground Railroad_ should have a\r\nplace in every comprehensive library, private or public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Underground Railroad, by William Still",
